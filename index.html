The goal is to use natural language processing to convert unstructured data(text) into conventional data to be used in portfolio construction.
The proof on concept is performed on SEC 10K documents, modeling their effect on short-term stock returns with the objective of extending the research to news, social media and industry reports.

Since 10K documents are dated, we can relate the short-term stock returns of a stock around the same date to their published filings. Given that there are limits to human attention and the volume of filings published, we are looking to design a programmatic way to predict the “sentiment” and eventually design a long-short portfolio to exploit the analysis.
