Sentimetre is using big data, natural language processing and predictive analytics to optimize investment research and portfolio construction. Our specialty is developing models for aggregating trade signals from unstructured data sets. 
Our models are targeted towards generating alpha from financial statements, regulatory announcements, news articles and Twitter.

Our primary asset class is equities, and using the predictions on underlying equities to predict stock indexes. Our asset universe is currenlty limited to our access to data but the basic concepts are easily expandable to other assets.

Application of artificial intelligence to finance suffers from:
1. Labelled data are unavailable.
2. Clean, up-to-date reference financial data is expensive.
3. Data sets are available in high-resource languages like English but not in low-resource languages e.g. CoFiF corpus in French

Sentimetre's proof-of-concept was built on two datasets:
1. Reuters dataset 1 2017-2020 : (https://www.kaggle.com/miguelaenlle/reuters-articles-for-3500-stocks-since-2017)
2. Reuters dataset 2 : (https://github.com/mike0sv/Reuters-full-data-set/tree/master/data)
3. 10Q quartely financial statements 1993 -2020 EDGAR: Proved to be too noisy
4. 8K financial statements 1993 -2020 EDGAR: Proved to be too noisy
