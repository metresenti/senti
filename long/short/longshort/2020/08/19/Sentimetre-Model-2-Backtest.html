<p>**Backtest:</p>
<p>We use a long-short equally-weighted portfolio backtest for all our models. Other papers are tended to use the top 10 long predictions and top 10 short predictions to build a portfolio but we prefer to include all predictions in our portfolio. We assume that we are able to buy at market open and liquidate at market close. We don’t take into account transaction costs and slippage as we did not have the adequate resources.</p>
<p>**Proof-of-Concept 1: Reuters dataset 1 2017-2020</p>
<p>Data is segmented into training data (2017-2018) and test data (2019-2020). Preprocessing of the text data for text normalization, stemming, lemmatization and extraction of stop words.</p>

REUTERS/DANIEL BECERRIL  WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - GENERAL MOTORS CO (GM.N) HIT 200,000 TOTAL ELECTRIC VEHICLES SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE END OF 2018, REACHING A THRESHOLD THAT TRIGGERS A PHASE-OUT OF A $7,500 FEDERAL TAX CREDIT OVER THE NEXT 15 MONTHS, A PERSON BRIEFED ON THE MATTER SAID WEDNESDAY.  THE LARGEST U.S. AUTOMAKER REACHED THE FIGURE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WHICH MEANS THE CREDIT WILL FALL TO $3,750 IN APRIL, AND THEN DROP TO $1,875 IN OCTOBER FOR SIX MONTHS. THE CREDIT WILL COMPLETELY DISAPPEAR BY APRIL 2020. THE 200,000 FIGURE COVERS GM\u2019S CUMULATIVE EV SALES SINCE 2010.  THE TAX CREDIT IS AIMED AT DEFRAYING THE COST OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN SIMILARLY SIZED INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE VEHICLES. IN 2009, CONGRESS SET THE PHASE-OUT THRESHOLD AT 200,000 VEHICLES PER MANUFACTURER.  GM, WHICH SAID PREVIOUSLY IT EXPECTED TO REACH THE 200,000 SALES FIGURE BEFORE THE END OF 2018, DECLINED TO COMMENT AHEAD OF THE RELEASE OF ITS QUARTERLY SALES RESULTS ON THURSDAY.  GM AND TESLA INC (TSLA.O), WHICH HIT THE 200,000 FIGURE IN JULY 2018, HAVE BOTH LOBBIED CONGRESS TO LIFT THE CAP OR EXTEND THE EXISTING TAX CREDIT. TESLA\u2019S EV TAX CREDIT FELL TO $3,750 ON TUESDAY AND TESLA SAID IT WAS CUTTING PRICES ON ITS EVS BY $2,000 TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE LOWER TAX CREDIT.  IN MARCH, GM CHIEF EXECUTIVE MARY BARRA CALLED ON CONGRESS TO EXPAND THE CONSUMER TAX CREDIT FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES AS THE COMPANY BOOSTED PRODUCTION OF THE EV BOLT IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMER DEMAND. SHE REPEATED THE REQUEST LAST MONTH DURING A VISIT TO CAPITOL HILL.

EUROPEAN MARKETS WERE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW, WITH BOOKMAKERS PREDICTING LONDON\u2019S FTSE AND FRANKFURT\u2019S DAX WOULD OPEN 0.4 PERCENT LOWER AND PARIS\u2019 CAC40 DOWN 0.6 PERCENT.  APPLE BLAMED FEWER IPHONE UPGRADES AND SLOWING SALES IN CHINA IN ITS MOST RECENT QUARTER, ITS FIRST SUCH WARNING SINCE 2007. ITS SHARES TUMBLED IN AFTER-HOURS TRADE.  THE NEWS SPARKED A \u2018FLASH CRASH\u2019 IN HOLIDAY-THINNED CURRENCY MARKETS AS INVESTORS RUSHED TO LESS RISKY ASSETS, WITH THE JAPANESE YEN SOARING AGAINST MOST MAJOR CURRENCIES IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.  U.S. STOCK FUTURES POINTED TO ANOTHER ROUGH START ON WALL STREET, WITH NASDAQ E-MINI FUTURES DOWN 2.6 PERCENT AND S&P 500 E-MINI FUTURES OFF 1.6 PERCENT.

THE VOLATILE DAY FOR ASIA FOLLOWED SWINGS ON WALL STREET OVERNIGHT, WHERE SHARES SLID IN EARLY TRADE ON GROWTH WORRIES BEFORE CLAWING BACK LOSSES AS SURGING OIL PRICES DROVE GAINS IN ENERGY SHARES.  APPLE SPECIFICALLY HIGHLIGHTED SLOWING CHINESE GROWTH AND SINO-U.S. TRADE TENSIONS, EXACERBATING INVESTORS\u2019 CONCERNS ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.  \u201cTHE FALL IN THE EM MANUFACTURING PMI LAST MONTH WAS FAIRLY BROAD-BASED AND SUPPORTS OUR VIEW THAT GROWTH IN THE EMERGING WORLD AS A WHOLE WILL SLOW THIS YEAR,\u201d GABRIELLA DICKENS, AN ECONOMIST AT CAPITAL ECONOMICS, SAID IN A NOTE.  ADDING TO THE SOUR MOOD, A MEETING BETWEEN U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS PRODUCED NO AGREEMENT TO END A PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.  TRUMP\u2019S DEMAND FOR $5 BILLION IN FUNDING FOR A WALL ALONG THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER TRIGGERED THE SHUTDOWN AFFECTING ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND 800,000 FEDERAL WORKERS.  \u2018FLASH CRASH\u2019  CURRENCY MARKETS SAW A WILD SPIKE IN VOLATILITY IN EARLY ASIAN TRADE, WITH RISK AVERSION PUSHING THE YEN SHARPLY HIGHER AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR, BREAKING KEY TECHNICAL LEVELS AND TRIGGERING STOP-LOSS SALES OF U.S. AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS.

REUTERS/CHARLES PLATIAU  THE NEW LIST PRICE FOR PRALUENT WILL BE $5,850 A YEAR, MATCHING THE PRICE AMGEN SET WHEN IT LOWERED THE LIST OF ITS COMPETING DRUG, REPATHA, IN OCTOBER.  SANOFI AND REGENERON SAID THEY EXPECT THE LOWER-PRICED PRALUENT TO BE AVAILABLE FOR PHARMACIES TO ORDER IN EARLY MARCH. THEY SAID THE NEW PRICE SHOULD IMPROVE PATIENT ACCESS AND RESULT IN LOWER OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS FOR U.S. CONSUMERS.  PRALUENT AND REPATHA BELONG A CLASS OF INJECTABLE BIOTECH DRUGS CALLED PCSK9 INHIBITORS THAT DRAMATICALLY LOWER BAD LDL CHOLESTEROL AND REDUCE THE RISK OF HEART ATTACKS AND DEATH.  SALES OF BOTH HAVE BEEN SEVERELY CONSTRAINED BY ONEROUS ROADBLOCKS TO PATIENT ACCESS PUT UP BY INSURERS LOOKING TO LIMIT SPENDING ON THE EXPENSIVE DRUGS.  THEY WERE APPROVED IN 2015 WITH INITIAL LIST PRICES OF MORE THAN $14,000 A YEAR.  IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR, REGENERON AND SANOFI SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO CHARGE LESS FOR THEIR DRUG IF INSURERS AGREED TO REDUCE BARRIERS FOR HIGH-RISK HEART PATIENTS.  A FEW MONTHS LATER THEY STRUCK A DEAL WITH EXPRESS SCRIPTS, NOW PART OF CIGNA CORP, TO MAKE THE DRUG AVAILABLE TO THAT COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMERS AT A PRICE IN THE RANGE OF $4,500 TO $6,600 A YEAR.

QUALCOMM ASKED FOR AN IMPORT BAN ON SOME OLDER IPHONE MODELS CONTAINING INTEL CORP CHIPS.  IN SEPTEMBER, THOMAS PENDER, AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE AT THE ITC, FOUND THAT APPLE VIOLATED ONE OF THE PATENTS IN THE CASE BUT DECLINED TO ISSUE A BAN.

PENDER\u2019S RULING SAID THAT PRESERVING COMPETITION IN THE MODEM CHIP MARKET WAS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST AS SPEEDIER 5G NETWORKS COME ONLINE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.  CASES WHERE THE ITC FINDS PATENT VIOLATIONS BUT DOES NOT BAN THE IMPORT OF PRODUCTS ARE RARE. IN DECEMBER, THE FULL ITC SAID IT WOULD REVIEW PENDER\u2019S DECISION AND DECIDE WHETHER TO UPHOLD OR REVERSE IT BY LATE MARCH.  IN FILINGS THAT BECAME PUBLIC LATE LAST WEEK AHEAD OF THE FULL COMMISSION\u2019S DECISION, APPLE FOR THE FIRST TIME SAID THAT IT HAD DEVELOPED A SOFTWARE FIX TO AVOID RUNNING AFOUL OF QUALCOMM\u2019S PATENT.

APPLE ASKED THE FULL COMMISSION TO DELAY ANY POSSIBLE IMPORT BAN BY THAT LONG IF THE COMMISSION REVERSES THE JUDGE\u2019S DECISIONS.

FILE PHOTO: A WOMAN HOLDS HER PHONE NEAR AN APPLE COMPANY LOGO IN BEIJING, CHINA DECEMBER 14, 2018. REUTERS/JASON LEE  JUDGE GONZALO CURIEL OF THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA ON THURSDAY RULED THAT QUALCOMM, THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST SUPPLIER OF MOBILE PHONE CHIPS, WAS OBLIGATED TO PAY NEARLY $1 BILLION IN REBATE PAYMENTS TO APPLE, WHICH FOR YEARS USED QUALCOMM\u2019S MODEM CHIPS TO CONNECT IPHONES TO WIRELESS DATA NETWORKS.  THE PAYMENTS WERE PART OF A BUSINESS COOPERATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO COMPANIES AMID THE PECULIAR PATENT LICENSING PRACTICES OF THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY.  IN GENERAL, THE CONTRACT FACTORIES THAT BUILT APPLE\u2019S IPHONES WOULD PAY QUALCOMM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR THE USE OF QUALCOMM\u2019S PATENTED TECHNOLOGY IN IPHONES, A COST THAT APPLE WOULD REIMBURSE THE CONTRACT FACTORIES FOR. SEPARATELY, QUALCOMM AND APPLE HAD A COOPERATION AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH QUALCOMM WOULD PAY APPLE A REBATE ON THE IPHONE PATENT PAYMENTS IF APPLE AGREED NOT TO ATTACK IN COURT OR WITH REGULATORS.  IN A LAWSUIT FILED TWO YEARS AGO, APPLE SUED QUALCOMM, ALLEGING THAT THE CHIP SUPPLIER HAD BROKEN THE COOPERATION AGREEMENT BY NOT PAYING NEARLY $1 BILLION IN PATENT ROYALTY REBATES.  QUALCOMM IN TURN ALLEGED THAT IT STOPPED PAYING THE REBATE PAYMENTS BECAUSE APPLE HAD BROKEN THE AGREEMENT BY URGING OTHER SMARTPHONE MAKERS TO COMPLAIN TO REGULATORS AND MAKING \u201cFALSE AND MISLEADING\u201d STATEMENTS TO THE KOREAN FAIR TRADE COMMISSION, WHICH WAS INVESTIGATING QUALCOMM OVER ANTITRUST ALLEGATIONS.

JUDGE CURIEL SIDED WITH APPLE, RULING THAT QUALCOMM OWED THE MISSED REBATE PAYMENTS.  \u201cQUALCOMM\u2019S ILLEGAL BUSINESS PRACTICES ARE HARMING APPLE AND THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY,\u201d APPLE SAID IN A STATEMENT.

AND IT IS UNLIKELY THAT QUALCOMM WILL MAKE A NEW PAYMENT TO APPLE.  APPLE\u2019S CONTRACT FACTORIES, WHICH UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD PAY QUALCOMM FOR PATENT ROYALTIES OWED ON IPHONES, HAVE ALREADY WITHHELD THE NEARLY $1 BILLION IN PAYMENTS TO QUALCOMM.

REUTERS/RICARDO MORAES/FILE PHOTO  THE PLAN TO SPLIT UP THE CARRIER, FILED IN A BRAZILIAN COURT ON WEDNESDAY, IS A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM A PREVIOUS PROPOSAL AND ADDS FRESH COMPETITION FOR SOME OF THE MOST-COVETED AIRPORT SLOTS IN BRAZIL. BUT IT ALSO SHUTS THE DOOR ON A PREVIOUS OFFER BY COMPETITOR AZUL SA.  AZUL SIGNED A PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT THIS MONTH TO PAY AT LEAST $105 MILLION FOR A SELECTION OF AVIANCA BRASIL\u2019S ASSETS, A PROPOSAL THAT HAD BEEN CONSIDERED A COUP BY ANALYSTS WHO SAW IT AS A WAY FOR AZUL TO CHALLENGE ITS BIGGER COMPETITORS: LATAM AND GOL.  AZUL ALSO LAST MONTH GAVE AVIANCA BRASIL A MUCH-NEEDED CASH INJECTION OF 31.6 MILLION REAIS ($8.21 MILLION) AFTER IT FELL BEHIND ON ITS PAYROLL.

A PERSON INVOLVED IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS SAID LAST WEEK THAT DISAGREEMENTS HAD EMERGED BETWEEN AZUL AND CREDITORS THAT THREATENED TO DERAIL THE INITIAL $105 MILLION OFFER.  AZUL DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE STATUS OF ITS POTENTIAL BID. TO BE SURE, AZUL COULD STILL BID, BUT NOT UNDER ITS INITIAL PROPOSAL, WHICH HAD ALSO INCLUDED TAKING OVER MANY OF AVIANCA\u2019S AIRCRAFT LEASES.  AZUL CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER JOHN RODGERSON TOLD REUTERS IN MARCH THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT LATAM OR GOL COULD BID FOR AVIANCA BRASIL, DUE TO POTENTIAL ANTITRUST ISSUES.

REUTERS/CHARLES PLATIAU  LONDON (REUTERS BREAKINGVIEWS) - DEUTSCHE BANK\u2019S LATEST STRATEGY FOR BOOSTING ITS APPEAL MAY BE ITS MOST EFFECTIVE YET: THE GERMAN LENDER HEADED BY CHRISTIAN SEWING HAS BANNED STAFF FROM DORCHESTER COLLECTION HOTELS AFTER ITS OWNER, THE GOVERNMENT OF BRUNEI, IMPLEMENTED HOMOPHOBIC LAWS. SHAREHOLDERS WILL WELCOME THE FACT THAT EMPLOYEES OF A BANK WHOSE COSTS ATE UP 93 PERCENT OF REVENUE LAST YEAR WILL NO LONGER FREQUENT A CHAIN WHICH CHARGES NEARLY 400 POUNDS A NIGHT FOR A STANDARD ROOM IN LONDON. HOWEVER, THE DECISION RAISES THE MORAL BAR.  BRUNEI\u2019S STATE-OWNED INVESTMENT AGENCY OWNS THE DORCHESTER COLLECTION HOTEL GROUP, WHICH INCLUDES LUXURY VENUES SUCH AS THE BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL AND HOTEL BEL-AIR IN LOS ANGELES. OSCAR-WINNING ACTOR GEORGE CLOONEY CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT AFTER THE GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTED ISLAMIC LAWS WHICH WOULD IMPOSE THE DEATH PENALTY FOR HOMOSEXUALITY OR ADULTERY. CELEBRITIES INCLUDING SINGER ELTON JOHN HAVE JOINED IN.  SHUNNING THE SULTANATE IS RELATIVELY PAINLESS FOR DEUTSCHE, WHICH HAS LIMITED BUSINESS IN BRUNEI. YET LIKE MANY OF ITS GLOBAL PEERS THE BANK CONTINUES TO OPERATE IN SAUDI ARABIA, WHICH ALSO HAS STRINGENT ANTI-HOMOSEXUALITY LAWS. GOLDMAN SACHS CEO DAVID SOLOMON RECENTLY MET GOVERNMENT-LINKED CLIENTS IN THE DESERT KINGDOM.  BANKS AND OTHER BIG MULTINATIONALS LONG ARGUED THAT THEY HAD TO ACCEPT THE LAWS OF COUNTRIES WHERE THEY DO BUSINESS. BUT PRESSURE FROM CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS IS FORCING THEM TO SET OUT MORAL POSITIONS. EMPLOYERS\u2019 EFFORTS TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A DIVERSE WORKFORCE IN THE WEST IS ALSO INCREASINGLY HARD TO SQUARE WITH MAINTAINING LINKS WITH REPRESSIVE REGIMES.  BIG COMPANIES GENERALLY MUSTER TWO DEFENCES. THE FIRST IS THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, A BOYCOTT WOULD BE COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE. THIS IS HOW COMPANIES JUSTIFIED THEIR PRESENCE IN SAUDI ARABIA \u2013 WHICH RECENTLY ALLOWED WOMEN TO DRIVE \u2013 AT LEAST UNTIL THE BRUTAL MURDER OF JOURNALIST JAMAL KHASHOGGI BY SAUDI AGENTS LAST YEAR. THE SECOND DEFENCE IS THAT COMPANIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS TO WEIGH THE COSTS OF BOYCOTTING CERTAIN COUNTRIES AGAINST THE REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE OF WORKING WITH THEM.  INCREASED INVESTOR DEMAND FOR COMPANIES TO MEET A RANGE OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA MEANS BANKS ESPECIALLY WILL FACE MORE AWKWARD QUESTIONS ABOUT BUSINESS IN ILLIBERAL COUNTRIES. SO WHILE DEUTSCHE\u2019S BRUNEI BOYCOTT MAY BE RELATIVELY COST-FREE, IT WILL FACE BIGGER FINANCIAL TESTS IN THE FUTURE.", "Ticker": "DB", "Date": "2019-04-05T00:00:00", "key": "20190405DB", "labelr0": -1.7647058823529451, "labelr1": -0.35928143712574084, "labelr2": -0.9615384615384625, "labelr3": -0.3640776699029049, "labelr4": 2.1924482338611413, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.28600000000000003, "compound": -0.5574, "0_day_return": -1.764705882352946, "1_day_return": -1.764705882352946, "2_day_return": -1.3173652694610571, "3_day_return": -1.676646706586804, "4_day_return": 0.4790419161676773, "label": -1, "return": 0.00104746019707077, "excess_return": -1.7657533425500167, "count_of_word": 403, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5223258, "prof1": 0.4776742, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5352209962070591, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4647790037929409, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5223258, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.4776742, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.41841668, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.5815833, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.45513648, "tr_prof1": 0.54486346, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.40975457, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.5902455, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.66268986, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.33731009999999995, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.6863019, "headline_prof21": 0.31369817, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.29829064, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.7017094, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.6493423, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.35065767, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.836269, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.163731, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -1.764705882352946, "returnpredvader": 1.764705882352946, "returnpredsgd": 1.764705882352946, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9994022631720106, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0038450730263726, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0031149099661378, "cumreturn1b": 1.3453430857655477, "cumreturn1d": 1.122232811430224, "cumreturn1e": 1.1620621979555315, "cumreturndow": 1.153679432733193, "cumreturnsp500": 1.128276727515149}, {"Unnamed: 0": 4834, "Unnamed: 0.1": 4834, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 4834, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 4834, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 4834, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 4834, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 4834, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 4834, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 4834, "level_0": 4834, "index": 4834, "text": "(FOR A LIVE BLOG ON THE U.S. STOCK MARKET, CLICK OR TYPE LIVE/ IN A NEWS WINDOW.)

FILE PHOTO: A LOGO OF THE BRAZIL'S STATE-RUN PETROBRAS OIL COMPANY IS SEEN IN RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL MARCH 25, 2019. REUTERS/SERGIO MORAES  THE NATIONAL ENERGY COUNCIL ANNOUNCED ON TUESDAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD PAY PETROBRAS, AS THE COMPANY IS KNOWN, $9.058 BILLION TO END THEIR CONTRACT DISPUTE REGARDING THE \u201cTRANSFER OF RIGHTS AREA\u201d (TOR).  WHAT IS THAT?  THE TOR AREA IS A ROUGHLY 2,800-SQUARE-KM (1,080-SQUARE-MILE) ZONE OFF THE COAST OF SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL WHERE BILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL ARE TRAPPED BENEATH A THICK LAYER OF SALT UNDER THE OCEAN FLOOR. IT IS PART OF A LARGER OIL-PRODUCING ZONE KNOWN AS THE PRE-SALT, WHICH HAS EMERGED AS ONE OF THE WORLD\u2019S MOST PROMISING CONVENTIONAL OIL PLAYS.  THE TOR WAS DEMARCATED IN A 2010 DEAL BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND PETROBRAS, WHEN THE COMPANY RAISED SOME $70 BILLION IN THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST-EVER SHARE OFFERING AT THE TIME.  IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, THE GOVERNMENT GRANTED PETROBRAS THE RIGHTS TO EXTRACT 5 BILLION BARRELS OF OIL IN THE TOR AREA IN RETURN FOR NEW SHARES WORTH 74.8 BILLION REAIS, OR ABOUT $42.5 BILLION AT THE TIME.  THE GOVERNMENT ALSO SET ASIDE A \u201cCONTINGENCY AREA\u201d OF ABOUT 1,000 SQUARE KM (390 SQUARE MILES) IN CASE THE ORIGINAL AREA PROVED INSUFFICIENT.  WHY THE DISPUTE?  THE TOR ARRANGEMENT PROVIDED FOR PETROBRAS AND THE GOVERNMENT TO REVISE SOME TERMS IN THE CONTRACT WHEN FIELDS WERE DECLARED COMMERCIALLY VIABLE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SHIFTS IN OIL PRICES, PRODUCTION COSTS AND OTHER VARIABLES.  PETROBRAS BEGAN DECLARING TOR FIELDS COMMERCIALLY VIABLE IN 2013, STARTING WITH THE BUZIOS FIELD, AND HAS BEEN HAGGLING OVER CONTRACT REVISIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT EVER SINCE, AS OIL PRICES SWUNG SHARPLY AND STUDIES SHOWED LARGER RESERVES IN THE AREA.  BRAZILIAN OIL REGULATOR ANP NOW BELIEVES THERE ARE SOME 6 BILLION TO 15 BILLION BARRELS OF OIL IN THE TOR AREA, IN ADDITION TO THE ORIGINAL 5 BILLION BARRELS GRANTED TO PETROBRAS.  BRAZIL\u2019S CASH-STRAPPED GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO OFFER THAT ADDITIONAL OIL AT AUCTION BECAUSE IT HAD NOT COME TO TERMS WITH PETROBRAS ON THE REVISED TOR CONTRACT.  UNTIL RECENT MONTHS, THE TWO SIDES SEEMED FAR APART. BUT SINCE NEW PRESIDENT JAIR BOLSONARO APPOINTED A NEW PETROBRAS CHIEF EXECUTIVE IN JANUARY, TALKS SEEM TO HAVE PICKED UP PACE, CULMINATING IN THE MORE THAN $9 BILLION AGREEMENT.  WHAT IS NEXT?  THE GOVERNMENT HAS SCHEDULED FOR OCT. 28 AN AUCTION FOR THE RIGHTS TO EXTRACT THE EXCESS OIL IN THE TOR AREA, DIVIDED INTO FOUR SEPARATE FIELDS CALLED ATAPU, BUZIOS, ITAPU E SEPIA.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE AUCTION COULD RAISE SOME 100 BILLION REAIS ($26 BILLION) OR MORE.  PETROBRAS AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE STILL DISCUSSING HOW THE AUCTION WINNERS WILL POTENTIALLY PARTNER WITH THE STATE OIL COMPANY, WHICH IS ALREADY PRODUCING AT BUZIOS AND HAS THE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL TO REMAIN OPERATOR AT THE FOUR FIELDS.  REGARDLESS OF THE FINAL ARRANGEMENT, WINNERS OF THE AUCTION WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMPENSATE PETROBRAS FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPLORATORY WORK IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ALREADY INVESTED.  WHILE THE EXACT VALUE OF THAT COMPENSATION HAS NOT BEEN SETTLED, REUTERS REPORTED LATE LAST YEAR THAT THE COMPENSATION, WHICH IS SEPARATE FROM THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PAYMENT, IS LIKELY TO BE AT LEAST 30 BILLION REAIS ($7.9 BILLION).  WHO IS INTERESTED?  THE OCTOBER AUCTION IS EXPECTED TO ATTRACT A RANGE OF MAJOR GLOBAL OIL COMPANIES, WHICH HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THE OPPORTUNITY WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN RECENT MONTHS.  NOT LEAST AMONG THE INTERESTED PARTIES IS PETROBRAS ITSELF. WHILE THE FIRM IS AGGRESSIVELY CUTTING DEBT, CEO CASTELLO BRANCO HAS SAID THE $9 BILLION PAYMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE USED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE AUCTION.  AMONG THE COMPANIES WITH EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ASSETS ADJACENT OR RELATIVELY CLOSE TO THE TOR AREA, OFFERING POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS, ARE TOTAL SA, ROYAL DUTCH SHELL PLC, AND CHINA\u2019S CNOOC LTD AND CNPC.  HOWEVER, THEY MAY NEED TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR POLITICAL INTERFERENCE OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.  HOUSE SPEAKER RODRIGO MAIA HAS ARGUED THAT CONGRESS MUST APPROVE THE ACCORD BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND PETROBRAS BEFORE THE AUCTION CAN TAKE PLACE.

THE FOUR REPORTED A COMBINED CASH PROFIT OF A$14.5 BILLION FOR THE FIRST HALF OF EACH FINANCIAL YEAR, DOWN 4 PERCENT FROM THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR PRIOR, SHOWED DATA FROM KPMG.  AT WESTPAC, CASH PROFIT FELL 22 PERCENT IN OCTOBER-MARCH TO A$3.3 BILLION ($2.3 BILLION), VERSUS THE A$3.52 BILLION AVERAGE ESTIMATE OF SIX ANALYSTS POLLED BY REUTERS. CASH PROFIT IS A CLOSELY WATCHED MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE AS IT STRIPS OUT UNUSUAL ITEMS.  \u201cTHIS IS A DISAPPOINTING RESULT REFLECTING WEAKER BUSINESS CONDITIONS AND THE BANK DEALING DECISIVELY WITH OUTSTANDING ISSUES, INCLUDING REMEDIATION AND RESETTING OUR WEALTH STRATEGY,\u201d HARTZER SAID IN A STATEMENT.  THE TWO-CENTURIES-OLD LENDER, WHICH SERVES OVER 14 MILLION PEOPLE, LAST WEEK FLAGGED A A$617 MILLION HIT TO HALF-YEAR EARNINGS RELATED TO REFUNDING FEES INAPPROPRIATELY CHARGED, SUCH AS FOR FINANCIAL ADVICE NOT RENDERED. THE BANK HAS SINCE CEASED OFFERING FINANCIAL ADVICE.  \u201cHOUSE PRICES ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN SOFT AND HOME BUILDING IS SET TO REDUCE THROUGH 2019 AND INTO 2020,\u201d HARTZER SAID. WESTPAC EXPECTS HOUSING CREDIT TO SLOW TO 2.5 PERCENT IN ITS NEXT FINANCIAL YEAR FROM A RECORD-LOW 4 PERCENT AT PRESENT, HE SAID.  WESTPAC SAID ITS NET INTEREST MARGIN \u2014 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTEREST PAID AND INTEREST EARNED, MEASURING UNDERLYING PROFITABILITY \u2014 FELL 16 BASIS POINTS TO 2.12 PERCENT IN OCTOBER-MARCH. NET INTEREST INCOME FELL 4 PERCENT.  IN AUGUST, WESTPAC RAISED SOME HOME LOAN INTEREST RATES TO PRESERVE PROFIT MARGINS IN THE FACE OF HIGHER COSTS. BUT THE PROPERTY DOWNTURN AND TIGHTER LENDING CONDITIONS HAVE LEFT BANKS WRESTLING FOR CUSTOMERS, MAKING IT HARDER TO WRITE NEW LOANS.  THOUGH MAINTAINING A LOW LEVEL OF STRESSED EXPOSURE AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, WESTPAC ALSO REPORTED A 21 PERCENT SPIKE IN PROPERTIES IN POSSESSION TO 482 - ABOUT 0.31 PERCENT OF TOTAL LOANS.  WESTPAC SHARES WERE 1.6 PERCENT LOWER IN AFTERNOON TRADE, COMPARED WITH A 0.9 PERCENT FALL IN THE BROADER MARKET.  THE LENDER MAINTAINED ITS INTERIM DIVIDEND AT A$0.94 A SHARE, DECLINING TO FOLLOW THE LEAD OF NAB, THE FOURTH-BIGGEST LENDER, WHICH CUT ITS INTERIM DIVIDEND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE ON MAY 2.", "Ticker": "WBK", "Date": "2019-05-06T00:00:00", "key": "20190506WBK", "labelr0": -1.6486347243688837, "labelr1": -1.4667365112624466, "labelr2": 0.5847953216374429, "labelr3": -0.2642706131078261, "labelr4": 1.6428192898781064, "pos": 0.223, "neg": 0.315, "compound": -0.29600000000000004, "0_day_return": -1.6486347243688804, "1_day_return": -1.6486347243688804, "2_day_return": -0.8905185961236128, "3_day_return": -1.1524358302776316, "4_day_return": 0.4714510214772094, "label": -1, "return": -0.01651165143337798, "excess_return": -1.6321230729355023, "count_of_word": 562, "pred": -1, "prof-1": 0.48545608, "prof1": 0.5145439, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.537811697337687, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.462188302662313, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.48545608, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.5145439, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.48132226, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.5186778000000001, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5358014, "tr_prof1": 0.46419849999999996, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.6402217, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.35977829, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.43204004, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.56795996, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.71204525, "headline_prof21": 0.28795472, "textplusheadline_pred": -1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.5643640999999999, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.4356359, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.64463496, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.355365, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.7840099, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.21599005, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 1.6486347243688804, "returnpredvader": 1.6486347243688804, "returnpredsgd": 1.6486347243688804, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0068869131736942, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0104807632841502, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0063705070031186, "cumreturn1b": 1.5772572624918022, "cumreturn1d": 1.1856831462468493, "cumreturn1e": 1.2071053154592777, "cumreturndow": 1.1490101774395944, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1121743622849434}, {"Unnamed: 0": 6336, "Unnamed: 0.1": 6336, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 6336, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 6336, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 6336, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 6336, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6336, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6336, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6336, "level_0": 6336, "index": 6336, "text": "BERLIN/FRANKFURT, MAY 7 (REUTERS) - THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT MAY MOVE GERMAN STOCKS ON TUESDAY:  BMW  Q1 RESULTS DUE.

FILE PHOTO: THE MERCK LOGO IS SEEN AT A GATE TO THE MERCK & CO CAMPUS IN LINDEN, NEW JERSEY, U.S., JULY 12, 2018. REUTERS/BRENDAN MCDERMID/FILE PHOTO  THE NINE JUSTICES UNANIMOUSLY DIRECTED THE PHILADELPHIA-BASED 3RD U.S. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS TO RECONSIDER ITS DECISION TO LET THE LAWSUITS PROCEED EVEN THOUGH THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAD REBUFFED MERCK WHEN THE COMPANY SOUGHT TO ADD A WARNING TO FOSAMAX\u2019S LABEL ABOUT FRACTURE RISK.  MONDAY\u2019S RULING ADDED CLARITY TO A POWERFUL DEFENSE EMPLOYED BY DRUG MAKERS THAT PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER STATE LAW ARE PREEMPTED BY THE ACTIONS OF A FEDERAL AGENCY, BECAUSE FEDERAL LAW GENERALLY TRUMPS STATE LAW UNDER THE U.S. CONSTITUTION. MERCK ARGUED THAT IT CANNOT BE PENALIZED FOR FAILING TO ISSUE A WARNING THAT THE FDA HAD BLOCKED.  MERCK IN 2008 SUBMITTED DATA TO THE FDA SUGGESTING FOSAMAX MIGHT BE LINKED TO CERTAIN BONE FRACTURES, BUT THE FDA DENIED ITS WARNING LABEL PROPOSAL. AFTER A TASK FORCE FURTHER STUDIED THE ISSUE, THE FDA IN 2010 ORDERED MANUFACTURERS TO REVISE LABELS TO INCLUDE A WARNING, WHICH MERCK DID.  THE PLAINTIFFS CONTEND THAT THE FDA REJECTED ONLY MERCK\u2019S PROPOSED LANGUAGE FOR THE WARNING THAT FOCUSED ON RELATIVELY MINOR STRESS FRACTURES RATHER THAN THE MORE SERIOUS FRACTURES THEY SUFFERED.  IN A DECISION WRITTEN BY JUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER, THE SUPREME COURT SAID A DRUG MANUFACTURER MUST SHOW IT \u201cFULLY INFORMED\u201d THE FDA OF THE NEED FOR A WARNING BEFORE IT WAS REBUFFED AND THAT JUDGES, NOT JURIES, MUST DECIDE WHETHER SUCH LAWSUITS ARE PREEMPTED, AS MERCK HAS CLAIMED. LOWER COURTS NOW MUST REVISIT THE CASE REFLECTING THE SUPREME COURT\u2019S GUIDANCE.  MERCK\u2019S SHARES WERE FLAT ON MONDAY.  FOSAMAX HELPS PREVENT AND TREAT OSTEOPOROSIS, A CONDITION THAT CAN LEAD TO BONE FRACTURES, IN WOMEN WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH MENOPAUSE. BUT IT MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF FRACTURES IN THE THIGH BONE OR JUST BELOW THE HIP JOINT, OFTEN REQUIRING SURGICAL INTERVENTION.  \u2018FULLY COMMITTED\u2019  IN A STATEMENT, MERCK SAID IT WAS PLEASED WITH THE DECISION AND \u201cREMAINS FULLY COMMITTED TO DEFENDING THESE CASES GOING FORWARD AND WILL CONTINUE TO PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT IT ACTED APPROPRIATELY AT ALL TIMES IN REGARD TO THE POTENTIAL RISK OF ATYPICAL FEMUR FRACTURES.\u201d  DAVID FREDERICK, AN ATTORNEY FOR THE FOSAMAX USERS WHO SUED MERCK, SAID MONDAY\u2019S DECISION REAFFIRMS PATIENTS\u2019 ABILITY TO HOLD DRUG COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE. \u201cTHIS OPINION PROTECTS ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR INJURED PATIENTS,\u201d FREDERICK SAID.  SALES OF FOSAMAX, ALSO AVAILABLE AS A GENERIC DRUG, TOTALED $209 MILLION IN 2018, ACCORDING TO NEW JERSEY-BASED MERCK.  FOSAMAX USERS SUED MERCK, ALLEGING THE DRUG CAUSED THEM TO SUSTAIN SERIOUS THIGH BONE FRACTURES AND THAT THE COMPANY FAILED TO WARN OF THE RISK. THE NUMBER OF CASES HAS SWELLED TO MORE THAN 1,000.  A FEDERAL TRIAL COURT IN NEW JERSEY THREW OUT THE CASES, BUT IN 2017 THE 3RD CIRCUIT ALLOWED THE CLAIMS TO PROCEED TO TRIAL, RULING THAT A JURY COULD FIND THAT THE FDA HAD OBJECTED ONLY TO MERCK\u2019S PHRASING OF THE PROPOSED WARNING LABEL.  ON MONDAY, THREE JUSTICES - JOHN ROBERTS, SAMUEL ALITO AND BRETT KAVANAUGH - AGREED WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE CASE BUT DID NOT JOIN BREYER\u2019S DECISION. IN A SEPARATE OPINION, ALITO SIGNALED SYMPATHY FOR MERCK, NOTING THE FDA HAD LONG BEEN AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND WAS COMMUNICATING WITH DRUG MANUFACTURERS, AND NOTED THAT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP\u2019S ADMINISTRATION ALSO BACKS MERCK\u2019S POSITION.", "Ticker": "MRK", "Date": "2019-05-20T00:00:00", "key": "20190520MRK", "labelr0": 0.2032520325203209, "labelr1": 0.7860040567951377, "labelr2": 1.8616352201257915, "labelr3": 0.04939491232402079, "labelr4": 0.185139471735381, "pos": 0.25, "neg": 0.264, "compound": 0.2023, "0_day_return": 0.203252032520318, "1_day_return": 0.7860040567951421, "2_day_return": 2.6622718052738525, "3_day_return": 2.712981744421916, "4_day_return": 2.9031440162272, "label": 1, "return": 0.008495835608354471, "excess_return": 0.7775082211867876, "count_of_word": 606, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.50914305, "prof1": 0.49085692, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5462042740183362, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4537957259816639, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.50914305, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.49085692, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.39975286, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.6002470999999999, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5359199, "tr_prof1": 0.46408009999999994, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.63675475, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.36324522, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.45162532, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.5483748, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.5746704, "headline_prof21": 0.4253295999999999, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.42916992, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.57083005, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.5094332, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.49056688, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.61849546, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.38150459999999997, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": -0.7860040567951421, "returnpredvader": 0.7860040567951421, "returnpredsgd": -0.7860040567951421, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9988448674418348, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0064212449241183, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9995893186615816, "cumreturn1b": 1.6258078277798833, "cumreturn1d": 1.2109572290292614, "cumreturn1e": 1.2659456347419709, "cumreturndow": 1.1411656728828725, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1084153087876611}, {"Unnamed: 0": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6977, "level_0": 6977, "index": 6977, "text": "CHICAGO, MAY 21 (REUTERS) - JPMORGAN CHASE & CO SAID ON TUESDAY THAT ONLY 71.64 PERCENT OF SHAREHOLDERS VOTED TO APPROVE ITS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PACKAGES, MARKING A RARE INSTANCE OF CRITICISM OVER THE BANK\u2019S TOP LEADERS PAY.

THE ORGANIZATIONS' LETTER TO THE FIRMS CITED A RECENT REUTERS REPORT DOCUMENTING HOW CIGARETTE MAKER PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL INC HAS USED YOUNG PERSONALITIES ON INSTAGRAM TO SELL A NEW \"HEATED TOBACCO\" PRODUCT CALLED IQOS.  THE GROUPS SAID SOCIAL MEDIA FIRMS ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO REGULATE \u201cINFLUENCERS\u201d ON THEIR PLATFORMS WHO ARE HIRED BY COMPANIES TO PROMOTE NICOTINE PRODUCTS.  NO LAW SPECIFICALLY PREVENTS ONLINE TOBACCO OR E-CIGARETTE MARKETING, BUT SOCIAL MEDIA FIRMS HAVE POLICIES LIMITING IT. THE HEALTH GROUPS SAID IN THEIR LETTER THAT THE USE OF ONLINE PERSONALITIES CREATES A \u201cLOOPHOLE\u201d IN THOSE POLICIES AND ALLOWS \u201cRAMPANT MARKETING\u201d OF TOBACCO AND OTHER NICOTINE PRODUCTS TO YOUTH.  INSTAGRAM AND ITS PARENT COMPANY, FACEBOOK, ARE STUDYING THE ISSUE \u201cTO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE,\u201d SAID SPOKESWOMAN STEPHANIE OTWAY.  THE PLATFORMS CURRENTLY BAN BRAND ADVERTISING OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS, OTWAY SAID. THEIR POLICIES REQUIRE ANY SPONSORED \u201cINFLUENCER\u201d POSTS THAT EXPLICITLY RECOMMENDED BUYING TOBACCO PRODUCTS BE RESTRICTED ONLY TO PEOPLE OVER 18.  BUT THE SAME RESTRICTION WOULD NOT APPLY TO POSTS BY PAID INFLUENCERS THAT DEPICT TOBACCO PRODUCTS FAVORABLY WITHOUT EXPLICITLY SAYING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BUY THEM, OTWAY SAID.  IN MAKING POLICY FOR A BILLION USERS, THE COMPANY HAS TO DRAW LINES BETWEEN ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONAL POSTS AND \u201cSOMEONE HAVING AN OPINION,\u201d OTWAY SAID.

A REUTERS REVIEW OF TWITTER POLICIES SHOWS THAT ITS TOBACCO PROMOTION BAN DOES NOT INCLUDE SUCH MARKETING POSTS BY INDIVIDUALS.  REUTERS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL TWITTER POSTS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS FROM INFLUENCERS WHO POSTED PHOTOGRAPHS WITH IQOS DEVICES OR LINKED BACK TO INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS PROMOTING THE PRODUCT. TWITTER DID NOT COMMENT ON THE POSTS IDENTIFIED BY REUTERS.  SNAP INC DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT.  A WOMAN HOLDS A \"HEATED TOBACCO\" IQOS DEVICE, MADE BY PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL, IN AN INSTAGRAM POST UNDER AN ACCOUNT CALLED @IQOSTYLE.ARM, WHICH HAS THE HASHTAG #IQOSARMENIA, IN A POST FROM MAY 12, 2019. @IQOSTYLE.ARM/SOCIAL MEDIA  THE MORE THAN 100 ORGANIZATIONS FROM 48 COUNTRIES THAT SIGNED THE LETTER, WHICH WAS SENT TO THE COMPANIES FRIDAY AND PUBLICLY RELEASED WEDNESDAY, INCLUDED THE CAMPAIGN FOR TOBACCO-FREE KIDS, THE JAPAN SOCIETY FOR TOBACCO CONTROL AND THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS.  REUTERS EARLIER THIS MONTH DOCUMENTED HOW PHILIP MORRIS HAD USED YOUNG SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS, INCLUDING A 21-YEAR-OLD WOMAN IN RUSSIA, TO PROMOTE ITS IQOS DEVICE. THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERNAL MARKETING STANDARDS PROHIBIT IT FROM USING YOUTH-ORIENTED CELEBRITIES OR \u201cMODELS WHO ARE OR APPEAR TO BE UNDER THE AGE OF 25.\u201d  PHILIP MORRIS SAID MAY 10 THAT IT LAUNCHED AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION AND SUSPENDED ALL \u201cPRODUCT-RELATED DIGITAL INFLUENCER ACTIONS GLOBALLY\u201d AFTER REUTERS SOUGHT THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMENT ON EXAMPLES OF INSTAGRAM POSTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS DEPICTING YOUNG, HIP WOMEN ADVERTISING IQOS.

IN ADDITION, REUTERS HAS IDENTIFIED NEW EXAMPLES OF INSTAGRAM CONTENT FEATURING YOUNG PEOPLE WITH THE IQOS POSTED IN THE DAYS SINCE PHILIP MORRIS SAID IT HAD SUSPENDED ITS INFLUENCER CAMPAIGNS.  SEVERAL POSTS UNDER THE INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT @IQOS_EGYPT OVER THE PAST WEEK HAVE FEATURED YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN USING THE DEVICE AT BARS OR COCKTAIL EVENTS. OTHER POSTS FROM ACCOUNTS USING THE IQOS NAME IN POLAND, ARMENIA, ITALY AND IRAN OVER THE LAST WEEK ALSO SHOWED YOUNG, TRENDY MEN AND WOMEN USING THE DEVICES.  OTHER POSTS EMERGED OVER THE LAST WEEK FROM A PHOTOGRAPHER WHO DOCUMENTED AN IQOS-SPONSORED VIP LOUNGE AT AN APRIL MUSIC FESTIVAL IN COLOMBIA.  A REPRESENTATIVE FOR AN IQOS STORE IN SARNO, ITALY, SAID EMPLOYEES FOUND THE RECENT PHOTOS OF WOMEN USING IQOS ELSEWHERE ONLINE AND REPOSTED THEM ON THE STORE\u2019S INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT. A REPRESENTATIVE OF AN IQOS-BRANDED INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT IN ARMENIA DENIED BEING PAID BY PHILIP MORRIS TO PROMOTE THE PRODUCT.

NONE OF THE INFLUENCERS MENTIONED IN THE MAY 10 REUTERS REPORT RESPONDED TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT ON WHETHER THEY HAD BEEN ASKED TO STOP POSTING OR REMOVE POSTS MARKETING PHILIP MORRIS PRODUCTS.  PHILIP MORRIS SPOKESMAN RYAN SPARROW SAID THE FIRM HAD \u201cDIRECTED THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO NEW POSTS\u201d BY INFLUENCERS. SPARROW DID NOT RESPOND TO QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE COMPANY HAD STOPPED PAYING INFLUENCERS OR ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE EXISTING POSTS.  SPARROW SAID SOME OF THE NEW POSTS \u201cSEEM TO ORIGINATE FROM THIRD PARTIES, NOT PMI, AND IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE DO NOT SELL IQOS,\u201d NOTING EQYPT AND IRAN.  SPARROW DEFENDED THE SUSPENDED MARKETING CAMPAIGN AS A VITAL WAY TO INFORM ADULT CIGARETTE SMOKERS ABOUT SAFER OPTIONS. HE BLASTED THE CAMPAIGN FOR TOBACCO-FREE KIDS FOR \u201cTRYING TO PRESSURE US ... TO EFFECTIVELY BLOCK THESE CHANNELS\u201d AND \u201cIN EFFECT PERPETUATING THE CONSUMPTION OF TOBACCO IN ITS MOST HARMFUL FORM: COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES.\u201d  CAROLINE RENZULLI, A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE ANTI-TOBACCO CAMPAIGN, CALLED IT \u201cLAUGHABLE\u201d THAT PHILIP MORRIS USED SOCIAL MEDIA TO MARKET TO ADULTS.  PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL HAS LICENSED ALTRIA GROUP INC TO MARKET THE IQOS DEVICE IN THE UNITED STATES BEGINNING THIS SUMMER.  ALTRIA, WHICH SELLS MARLBORO CIGARETTES IN THE UNITED STATES, HAS PREVIOUSLY SAID IT HAS A POLICY OF NOT ADVERTISING ON SOCIAL MEDIA. HOWEVER, AN ONLINE JOB POSTING FROM THE COMPANY IN MARCH SEEKS A \u201cDIGITAL MARKETING SPECIALIST\u201d FOR THE \u201cIQOS BRAND TEAM.\u201d THE IDEAL CANDIDATE WILL DEVELOP MARKETING STRATEGY FOR \u201cE-COMMERCE, OWNED WEBSITES, SOCIAL MEDIA AND INFLUENCERS.\u201d  ALTRIA SPOKESMAN DAVID SUTTON SAID THE COMPANY HAS NO PLANS TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS TO MARKET IQOS BUT DID NOT RESPOND TO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE JOB POSTING MENTIONING AN INFLUENCER STRATEGY.  ELICENA ANDRADA, A MODEL FROM SPAIN WHOSE BIOGRAPHY LISTS SHE WAS CROWNED MISS AMERICA LATINO DEL MUNDO IN 2017, HOLDS AN IQOS \"HEATED TOBACCO\" DEVICE, MADE BY PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL IN AN INSTAGRAM POST ON AN ACCOUNT CALLED @IQOS_FRIENDS, IN A POST FROM MAY 12, 2019. @IQOS_FRIENDS/SOCIAL MEDIA VIA REUTERS  REGULATORY GRAY AREA  THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) LAST MONTH DECIDED TO ALLOW U.S. SALES OF THE IQOS DEVICE AFTER A TWO-YEAR REVIEW PROCESS IN WHICH PHILIP MORRIS REPEATEDLY ASSURED THE REGULATOR THAT IT WOULD WARN YOUNG PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE PRODUCT.  DIGITAL ADVERTISING OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS REMAINS A GRAY AREA FOR REGULATORS GLOBALLY. TOBACCO ADVERTISING REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE WERE WRITTEN BEFORE THE RISE OF SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING.  THE FDA, HOWEVER, CAN EXERT AUTHORITY OVER THE DIGITAL MARKETING OF NEW DEVICES IT CLEARS FOR SALE. AS A CONDITION OF ALLOWING PHILIP MORRIS TO SELL THE IQOS DEVICE, THE AGENCY REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE DETAILED ANALYSES OF THE AGE RANGES OF CONSUMERS IT REACHES WITH ONLINE MARKETING.

IT CONTROLS ABOUT 2.7 MILLION ACRES THERE ALREADY, SPLIT BETWEEN SHALE AND CONVENTIONAL PRODUCTION, AND WITH THE ANADARKO DEAL WILL ACQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL 240,000 ACRES IN ONE OF THE MORE PRODUCTIVE AREAS OF THE PERMIAN BASIN.  THE GULF OF MEXICO BUSINESS PROVIDED NEARLY A QUARTER OF ANADARKO\u2019S OIL AND GAS OUTPUT WHILE CONSUMING JUST 19 PERCENT OF PRODUCTION SPENDING. HOLLUB HAS PRAISED IT FOR ITS \u201cAMAZING FREE CASH FLOW,\u201d AND M&A ANALYSTS SAY COULD BE WORTH AT LEAST $6 BILLION.  POTENTIAL BUYERS WOULD BE THE HANDFUL OF LARGE COMPANIES WITH DEEPWATER EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING ROYAL DUTCH SHELL, EXXON MOBIL, TOTAL AND CHEVRON.  ANOTHER REASON TO SELL IT: OCCIDENTAL HAS NEVER OPERATED IN THE GULF BEFORE. THAT RAISES CONCERNS AMONG INVESTORS, SAID JENNIFER ROWLAND, AN ANALYST WITH EDWARD JONES.  \u201cIT JUST ADDS TO THE RISK OF A DEAL. THEY DON\u2019T HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE IN HOUSE,\u201d SHE SAID.  IN THE \u2018DOGHOUSE\u2019 WITH INVESTORS  ANOTHER LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR A SALE IS WESTERN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, ANADARKO\u2019S MAJORITY-OWNED GAS GATHERING AND PIPELINE BUSINESS, VALUED AT AROUND $7.5 BILLION. OCCIDENTAL HAS PREVIOUSLY SOLD OFF PIPELINES AND COASTAL TERMINALS. THE COMPANY\u2019S VIEW OF PIPELINE ASSETS, SAID FINANCE CHIEF CEDRIC BURGHER TO ANALYSTS, IS \u201cYOU DON\u2019T NEED TO OWN\u201d THEM, ONLY TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THEM.  IF HOLLUB CAN SELL THE OFFSHORE BUSINESS AND CLOSE THE DEAL WITH TOTAL, SHE COULD HIT A $10 BILLION TO $15 BILLION DIVESTMENT TARGET, SAID MATT SALLEE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT INVESTMENT FIRM TORTOISE CAPITAL ADVISORS. THAT COULD MAKE IT LESS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WOULD SELL ANY OF ITS ONSHORE OR PIPELINE OPERATIONS, HE SAID.  \u201cTHEY WOULD PROBABLY REALLY LIKE TO GET ANOTHER SALE DONE BEFORE THE DEAL CLOSES TO REMOVE THIS RISK\u201d OF TOO MUCH DEBT, SAID CHARLES JOHNSTON, ANALYST AT DEBT RESEARCH FIRM CREDITSIGHTS.  \u201cTHE LONGER THEY TAKE\u201d TO REDUCE DEBT FROM THE DEAL, \u201cTHE LONGER THEY STAY IN THE DOGHOUSE WITH INVESTORS,\u201d SAID ROWLAND.  OCCIDENTAL\u2019S STOCK FELL TO A 10-YEAR-LOW AFTER IT REACHED A MERGER AGREEMENT WITH ANADARKO AND ANALYSTS AT WELLS FARGO, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS AND EDWARD JONES LOWERED RATINGS ON THE COMPANY.  RATING FIRMS ARE FORECASTING A DEBT DOWNGRADE BECAUSE OF THE DEAL, THOUGH NONE EXPECT OCCIDENTAL WILL FALL INTO JUNK BOND STATUS. MOODY\u2019S INVESTORS SERVICE SAID A \u201cWEAKLY POSITIONED INVESTMENT GRADE RATING\u201d IS THE MOST LIKELY FOR OCCIDENTAL.  THE SPREAD ON ITS 2027 BONDS WIDENED A MODEST 50 BASIS POINTS SINCE THE DEAL WAS STRUCK.  \u201cTHE COMPANY DOES HAVE A GOOD TRACK RECORD OF BEING ABLE TO SELL NONCORE ASSETS AT GOOD PRICES,\u201d SAID CAROL LEVENSON, DIRECTOR AT CORPORATE BOND RESEARCH FIRM GIMME CREDIT.  IN ADDITION TO PAYING OFF THE DEAL\u2019S DEBT, HOLLUB NEEDS CASH TO COVER DIVIDENDS DUE SHAREHOLDERS AND BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC, WHICH NEGOTIATED AN 8 PERCENT ANNUAL PAYOUT ON A $10 BILLION INVESTMENT TO HELP FUND THE ANADARKO DEAL.

REUTERS/NICK OXFORD/FILE PHOTO/FILE PHOTO  STAYING FOCUSED ON SHALE  WHAT HOLLUB DOESN\u2019T WANT TO SELL IS THE MERGER\u2019S TOP PRIZE, ANADARKO\u2019S ACREAGE IN THE TOP U.S. SHALE FIELD, THE PERMIAN BASIN. ANADARKO\u2019S PROPERTIES THERE ARE VALUED AT ABOUT $18 BILLION, ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH FIRM DRILLINGINFO.  ANADARKO\u2019S COLORADO SHALE OPERATIONS WILL LIKELY REMAIN WITH THE OCCIDENTAL FOR A LACK OF READY BUYERS. NEW ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT GIVE COMMUNITIES MORE CONTROL OVER OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS HAVE CHILLED INDUSTRY INVESTMENTS IN THE STATE.  OCCIDENTAL ALSO WOULD WANT TO HANG ONTO ANADARKO\u2019S COLORADO SHALE ACREAGE, SAID ANDREW DITTMAR, AN M&A ANALYST WITH DRILLINGINFO, BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS \u201cREALLY GOOD AT DRILLING SHALE WELLS.\u201d", "Ticker": "OXY", "Date": "2019-05-28T00:00:00", "key": "20190528OXY", "labelr0": -2.225547035720961, "labelr1": -0.5355776587605224, "labelr2": -0.17307692307692962, "labelr3": -4.122519745713723, "labelr4": -0.9041591320072389, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.0, "0_day_return": -2.225547035720965, "1_day_return": -0.5355776587605221, "2_day_return": -0.7077276205049832, "3_day_return": -4.801071155317526, "4_day_return": -5.661820964039799, "label": -1, "return": -0.0069119122390440685, "excess_return": -0.528665746521478, "count_of_word": 950, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.47842640000000003, "prof1": 0.52157366, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4562400053329967, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5437599946670033, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.47842640000000003, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.52157366, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.576059, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.423941, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.47444823, "tr_prof1": 0.52555174, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.63929015, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.3607099, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.42214316, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.57785684, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.60172325, "headline_prof21": 0.3982768, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.35933343, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.64066654, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.60092795, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.39907205, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.2517665, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.74823356, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -0.5355776587605221, "returnpredvader": 0.5355776587605221, "returnpredsgd": -0.5355776587605221, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9985388775802949, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0008306403561047, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9988455062869247, "cumreturn1b": 1.63117966667434, "cumreturn1d": 1.2247992836167418, "cumreturn1e": 1.2729550525883475, "cumreturndow": 1.1087596514169036, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0762508182969652}, {"Unnamed: 0": 7250, "Unnamed: 0.1": 7250, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 7250, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 7250, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 7250, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 7250, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 7250, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 7250, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 7250, "level_0": 7250, "index": 7250, "text": "(REUTERS) - CYBERSECURITY COMPANY PALO ALTO NETWORKS INC FORECAST CURRENT-QUARTER PROFIT BELOW ANALYSTS\u2019 ESTIMATES ON WEDNESDAY, LARGELY DUE TO EXPENSES RELATED TO ITS RECENT ACQUISITIONS AND A HIT FROM TARIFFS, SENDING ITS SHARES DOWN 5%.

TARIFFS ON CHINESE IMPORTS ARE A CONCERN, AS PVH SOURCES A MAJORITY OF ITS APPAREL, FOOTWEAR AND ACCESSORIES FROM THE ASIAN COUNTRY. IN 2018, THE COMPANY IMPORTED ABOUT $400 MILLION OF INVENTORY FROM CHINA.  EARLIER THIS MONTH, U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP ESCALATED THE TRADE WAR BY RAISING TARIFFS ON $200 BILLION WORTH OF CHINESE GOODS TO 25% FROM 10%. THIS WAS IN ADDITION TO THE 25% TARIFF ON $50 BILLION WORTH OF CHINESE IMPORTS ALREADY IN PLACE.  CHIRICO, IN AN INTERVIEW ON CNBC, SAID THE LATEST DISCUSSIONS ON TARIFF AND TRADE ISSUES, WHICH INCLUDES PROPOSED TARIFFS ON A FURTHER $300 BILLION WORTH CHINESE IMPORTS, WAS NOT HIS MAIN CONCERN.  \u201cTHAT (TARIFFS) IS NOT THE ISSUE GOING FORWARD... WHAT WE\u2019RE SEEING IS A SLOWDOWN IN GROWTH AND A SLOWDOWN IN RETAIL SALES,\u201d HE TOLD CNBC, HIGHLIGHTING A SLOWDOWN IN INTERNATIONAL TOURISM IN THE UNITED STATES AND A STRONG DOLLAR.  \u201cWE\u2019VE REALLY SEEN SOME SOFTNESS IN THE BUSINESS,\u201d HE SAID.  PVH PROJECTED A 10 CENT CUT IN ITS FULL-YEAR ADJUSTED PROFIT PER SHARE DUE TO THE STRONG DOLLAR. IT NOW EXPECTS 2019 ADJUSTED PROFIT BETWEEN $10.20 AND $10.30 PER SHARE, WHICH INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE LATEST ROUND OF TARIFFS. WALL STREET WAS EXPECTING $10.42 PER SHARE, ON AVERAGE.  \u201cOF COURSE THE CEO\u2019S COMMENT IS MAKING INVESTORS NERVOUS.

ONE OF THE FIRST FIRMS TO JOIN AN ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD PROGRAMME THAT PROVIDES YEARS OF CONSUMER SHOPPING HISTORY, SNACK FOOD CHAIN BESTORE CO LTD PLANS TO LINK FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY WITH THE E-COMMERCE GIANT\u2019S ACCOUNT DATA BY THE YEAR\u2019S END.  FOR CUSTOMERS OPTING TO HAVE THEIR FACIAL DATA IN BESTORE\u2019S SYSTEMS, THAT MEANS SHOP ASSISTANTS WILL BE ABLE TO CHECK ON WHAT FOOD THEY LIKE THE MOMENT THEY ENTER ONE OF ITS STORES.  BESTORE, WHICH ALREADY OFFERS CUSTOMERS THE OPTION OF PAYING WITH ALIBABA\u2019S FACE SCANNING TABLETS, HAS ALSO STARTED USING ALIBABA\u2019S OTHER SERVICES FOR MORE SUCCESSFUL MARKETING.  IT CAN NOW ARRANGE FOR A PERSON WHO LIKES SALTY FOOD, OWNS AN SUV AND PROBABLY HAS A FAMILY TO RECEIVE AN AD SUGGESTING SUITABLE BESTORE SNACKS FOR A SPRING HOLIDAY ROAD TRIP, HUANG XIAO, BESTORE\u2019S HEAD OF E-COMMERCE, TOLD REUTERS.  \u201cWITH THE PARTNERSHIP, OUR STRATEGIES ARE MORE FOCUSED, SALES BEHAVIOURS ARE MORE TARGETED AND RESOURCES ARE BETTER ALLOCATED,\u201d HUANG SAID.  THE ALIBABA PROGRAMME, CALLED A100 AND WHICH COUNTS NESTLE SA AND PROCTER & GAMBLE CO AS CLIENTS, IS PART OF A MAJOR PUSH BY E-COMMERCE GIANTS IN CHINA TO RETOOL THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH MERCHANTS - OFFERING THEM A TROVE OF SHOPPER DATA IN RETURN FOR BROADER AND CLOSER PARTNERSHIPS.  THE SHIFT IS INTEGRAL TO WHAT CHINESE E-COMMERCE FIRMS CALL \u2018NEW RETAIL\u2019 OR \u2018BOUNDARY-LESS RETAIL\u2019 - THE MARRYING OF DATA AVAILABLE FROM INTERNET SHOPPING AND GATHERED THROUGH BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORES TO PROVIDE HIGHLY PERSONALISED SERVICES.  IT HAS BEEN ENABLED BY THE WIDESPREAD USE OF PAYMENTS BY SMARTPHONE, THE RISE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AND CHINESE CONSUMER TOLERANCE OF DATA-SHARING BETWEEN BUSINESSES.  OTHER SERVICES ALIBABA OFFERS TO RETAIL CLIENTS INCLUDE SHOPPER MOVEMENT \u2018HEAT MAPS\u2019 TO HELP STORES BETTER DESIGN THE LAYOUT OF PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS ITS CHAT APP DINGTALK TO COMMUNICATE WITHIN THEIR OWN COMPANIES AND WITH CUSTOMERS.  SEEKING MORE DATA  KEEPING MERCHANTS HAPPY AND SIGNING THEM UP FOR MORE SERVICES HAS TAKEN ON ADDED URGENCY FOR ALIBABA AND RIVAL JD.COM .  BOTH ARE SEEKING TO DIVERSIFY AMID SLOWING E-COMMERCE REVENUE GROWTH AT HOME - DUE IN PART TO SATURATED MARKETS IN CHINA\u2019S BIGGEST CITIES, FLAGGING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE FROM THE U.S.-CHINA TRADE WAR AND INCREASED COMPETITION FROM RIVALS SUCH AS NEWLY LISTED PINDUODUO INC.  \u201cFOR ALIBABA AND JD.COM THIS IS CRITICAL FOR THEIR OVERALL ECOSYSTEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE PRETTY MUCH ALREADY EXHAUSTED THE ONLINE GROWTH,\u201d SAID BEIJING-BASED JASON DING, PARTNER AT CONSULTING FIRM BAIN & COMPANY.  BY PROVIDING DATA-DRIVEN TOOLS TO RETAIL STORES, E-COMMERCE FIRMS CAN EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF DATA COLLECTED. \u201cIT\u2019S NOT JUST ABOUT MONEY, IT\u2019S ABOUT CONTINUING TO GROW, AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL FIND A WAY TO MONETISE THAT,\u201d HE SAID.  JD.COM, WHICH PROVIDES SIMILAR SERVICES TO ALIBABA, SAYS IT HELPED U.S. DIAPER BRAND \u201cHUGGIES\u201d WORK OUT WHY CHINESE COMPETITORS WERE RISING IN POPULARITY, PROMPTING HUGGIES TO CHANGE TO A MATERIAL THAT IS MORE ABSORBENT AND COMFORTABLE WHEN WET. THAT CONTRIBUTED TO A 60% PERCENT RISE IN HUGGIES SALES ON JD.COM IN 2018, THE CHINESE FIRM SAID.  A SPOKESMAN FOR KIMBERLY CLARK, WHICH OWNS THE HUGGIES BRAND, DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE DETAILS OF ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH JD.COM.  AFTER A TRIAL RUN OF A NEW PRODUCT, JD.COM SAID IT CREATES A \u2018PROFILE\u2019 OF A POTENTIAL BUYER BASED ON EARLY SALES THAT IS CROSS-CHECKED WITH ITS ENTIRE USERBASE, BEFORE TARGETED ADS ARE SENT TO CLOSE MATCHES.  OTHER TOOLS JD.COM OFFERS TO RETAIL CLIENTS INCLUDE AN CUSTOMER SERVICE CHATBOT POWERED BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT CAN THE \u201cSENSE\u201d THE MOOD OF CUSTOMERS, AND ADJUST ITS TONE TO APPEAR MORE EMPATHETIC.  IT HAS ALSO ROLLED OUT CHECKOUTS IN SOME HONG KONG CONVENIENCE STORES THAT CAN SCAN SEVERAL ITEMS AT ONCE AND CHARGE CUSTOMERS USING THEIR ID-LINKED ACCOUNTS, WHICH IT SAYS CUTS THE AVERAGE CHECKOUT TIME BY 30%.  FREE FOR NOW  BOTH JD.COM AND ALIBABA EXECUTIVES SAY THEY ARE NOT CHARGING COMPANIES FOR MOST DATA SERVICES AT THE MOMENT, NOTING THE NEW PARTNERSHIPS FACILITATE SALES OF OTHER SERVICES SUCH AS CLOUD COMPUTING AND LOGISTICS.  NESTLE, WHICH SELLS HAAGEN DAAZ AND NESPRESSO THROUGH THIRD-PARTY RETAIL LOCATIONS IN CHINA, SAYS IT NOW HAS ONE WAREHOUSE INSTEAD OF FOUR AFTER TAPPING INTO DATA AT ALIBABA DISTRIBUTION CENTERS WHICH GIVE REAL-TIME UPDATES ON ORDERS.  \u201cYOU DON\u2019T HAVE TO CARRY HUGE INVENTORY IN YOUR WAREHOUSE,\u201d SAID RASHID QURESHI, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF NESTLE\u2019S GREATER CHINA BUSINESS, ADDING IT\u2019S THE FIRST TIME NESTLE HAS INTEGRATED AN E-COMMERCE FIRM\u2019S DATA INTO ITS OWN SYSTEMS.  WHERE PREVIOUSLY BESTORE AND NESTLE WOULD HAVE DEALT WITH DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ALIBABA EMPIRE FOR DELIVERY, PAYMENTS, CLOUD COMPUTING AND MESSAGING, THEY NOW WORK WITH ONE ALIBABA TEAM DEDICATED TO THEIR COMPANY WHICH ORGANISES A RANGE OF TAILORED SERVICES.  \u201cIT\u2019S A CHANGE THAT SUBVERTS THE WAY OUR ENTIRE COMPANY HAS OPERATED,\u201d ALIBABA\u2019S JET JING TOLD REUTERS IN AN INTERVIEW. JING, FORMERLY PRESIDENT OF ALIBABA\u2019S RETAIL SITE TMALL, HAS SINCE BECOME ASSISTANT TO CEO DANIEL ZHANG.  ALIBABA HAS NOT DISCLOSED HOW MANY COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN ITS A100 PROGRAMME, BUT SOME ANALYSTS SAY FOR NOW ONLY BIG FIRMS WILL BE ABLE TO BENEFIT AS SMALLER FIRMS DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO JUSTIFY MAJOR ORGANISATIONAL CHANGES.  ONE RISK FOR RETAILERS, HOWEVER, IS THAT THEY MAY BECOME OVERLY DEPENDENT ON THEIR E-COMMERCE PARTNERS.  THE CHINESE MARKET REMAINS TOUGH FOR BRANDS TO CRACK INDEPENDENTLY AND ALIBABA AND JD.COM REPRESENT THE TWO BIGGEST ONLINE RETAIL CHANNELS INTO THE COUNTRY. IN THE FACE OF SUCH TOUGH COMPETITION, AMAZON.COM INC SAID IN APRIL IT IS SHUTTING ITS CHINA ONLINE STORE.  \u201cIT\u2019S A MUST FOR THE BRANDS TO BE INVOLVED,\u201d SAYS BAIN & COMPANY\u2019S DING. \u201cBUT EVERYONE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A BALANCE AND NOT PUT THEIR EGGS IN ONE BASKET.\u201d  MORE BROADLY, QUESTIONS REMAIN OVER HOW BIG E-COMMERCE FIRMS MANAGE THEIR DATA IN A WAY THAT IS FAIR TO ALL PARTIES USING THEIR SERVICES.

THE BANK\u2019S \u201cREINVENTION\u201d, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO LEAD TO 18,000 JOB CUTS BY 2022, INCLUDES THE CLOSURE OF ALL OF ITS EQUITIES TRADING AND CUTTING SOME PARTS OF ITS FIXED INCOME OPERATIONS.  DEUTSCHE BANK\u2019S PLANS TO SHRINK ITS ECM BUSINESS, WHICH INVOLVES RAISING MONEY FOR CORPORATE CLIENTS ON THE WORLD\u2019S STOCK MARKETS THROUGH IPOS AND PRIVATE PLACEMENTS, HAS LEFT SOME BANKERS QUESTIONING HOW IT CAN STILL COMPETE.  ITS FRANCHISE IS ALREADY UNDER PRESSURE. IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2019, DEUTSCHE BANK RANKED 13TH IN THE LEAGUE TABLE FOR GLOBAL EQUITY CAPITAL MARKET DEALS, DOWN FROM NINTH PLACE IN THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO, REFINITIV DATA SHOWS.  BUT IN ITS HOME MARKET, DEUTSCHE BANK WAS THIRD BIGGEST IN TERMS OF FEES IN 2018, LAGGING ITS U.S. WALL STREET RIVALS JP MORGAN (JPM.N) AND GOLDMAN SACHS (GS.N), THE DATA SHOWS.  ECM LEAGUE TABLES CAN BE VOLATILE GIVEN THERE ARE OFTEN LARGE SWINGS IN IPO VOLUMES FROM YEAR TO YEAR, WITH REVENUES FROM SUCH ACTIVITIES AT INVESTMENT BANKS ALREADY SUFFERING FROM REDUCED ISSUANCE AND FEE PRESSURE..  HOWEVER, DEUTSCHE BANK\u2019S ECM PRACTICE MADE UP JUST 3% PERCENT OF ITS TOTAL INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUE LAST YEAR AND SOURCES SAID A FALL IN PROCEEDS WOULD NOT HIT ITS BOTTOM LINE.  DEUTSCHE BANK HAS ALREADY AXED A NUMBER OF ECM BANKING ROLES IN ASIA, EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES SINCE CHIEF EXECUTIVE CHRISTIAN SEWING ANNOUNCED HIS OVERHAUL, SOURCES SAID.  VANISHING UNICORNS?  JASON COX, THE ASIA-PACIFIC HEAD OF EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS WAS LAID OFF AND TEAMS WERE DISBANDED IN JAPAN, AUSTRALIA AND MOST OF ASIA, SOURCES HAVE PREVIOUSLY SAID.  AT LEAST THREE MEMBERS OF THE LONDON TEAM LOST THEIR JOBS ON MONDAY, SOURCES SAID, AND THE ROLES OF GLOBAL HEAD OF ECM AND GLOBAL HEAD OF EQUITY SYNDICATE, RESPONSIBLE FOR RESEARCHING AND MARKETING IPOS, REMAIN VACANT.  AND TEAMS COULD GRADUALLY BE REDUCED FURTHER, THE SOURCES TOLD REUTERS, WITH A LIKELY KNOCK-ON EFFECT.  \u201cTHE VERY SMALL ECM TEAM THAT WE WILL HAVE GLOBALLY AFTER THIS WILL MEAN THAT WE WON\u2019T GET SENIOR ROLES IN ANY OF THE IPOS,\u201d A SENIOR DEUTSCHE BANK INVESTMENT BANKER IN ASIA SAID.  \u201cSO IF A COMPANY IN LONDON OR A UNICORN IN CHINA IS LOOKING TO DO AN IPO, THEY WOULD NOT LOOK AT DEUTSCHE AS A LEAD, NOR WILL WE PITCH FOR THAT ROLE,\u201d THE SENIOR BANKER SAID, ADDING THAT THE BANK COULD STILL PITCH FOR JUNIOR ROLES IN SOME DEALS.  IN THE UNITED STATES, IT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON SECTORS THAT IT DEEMS STRATEGIC, A SOURCE CLOSE TO DEUTSCHE BANK SAID.  THE UNDERWRITING ROLE IT SECURED IN THE IPO OF U.S. ELECTRIC BUS MAKER PROTERRA, WAS HELPED BY THE BANK\u2019S RELATIONSHIP WITH AUTO INVESTORS IN EUROPE, ANOTHER SOURCE SAID.  OVER THE PAST YEAR DEUTSCHE WON GLOBAL COORDINATOR ROLES FOR IPOS INCLUDING VOLKSWAGEN\u2019S TRUCK UNIT TRATON (8TRA.F) AND LUXURY CAR MAKER ASTON MARTIN (AML.L), AND BOOKRUNNER ROLES IN THE IPOS OF RIDE-HAILING GIANT UBER TECHNOLOGIES (UBER.N).  IT ALSO HAS A GLOBAL COORDINATOR ROLE ON THE IPO OF BREWING FIRM ANHEUSER-BUSCH INBEV NV\u2019S (ABI.BR) HONG KONG ARM BUDWEISER, WHICH ON FRIDAY DELAYED PRICING THE FLOTATION.  THERE ARE ALSO MORE DEALS IN PROSPECT, WITH DEUTSCHE BANK SECURING ROLES IN UP TO 10 WHICH SHOULD HAPPEN IN THE NEXT 12 TO 18 MONTHS IN EUROPE, A THIRD SOURCE SAID.", "Ticker": "DB", "Date": "2019-07-12T00:00:00", "key": "20190712DB", "labelr0": 2.540106951871651, "labelr1": 1.3037809647979093, "labelr2": 2.5740025740025763, "labelr3": -1.1292346298619809, "labelr4": 0.6345177664974597, "pos": 0.22, "neg": 0.102, "compound": 0.34, "0_day_return": 2.540106951871657, "1_day_return": 2.540106951871657, "2_day_return": 3.911342894393744, "3_day_return": 2.7379400260756137, "4_day_return": 3.3898305084745672, "label": 1, "return": 0.00017586909302389742, "excess_return": 2.5399310827786334, "count_of_word": 643, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.42651886, "prof1": 0.57348114, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.6027144590538966, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.3972855409461034, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.42651886, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.57348114, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.36724028, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.6327596999999999, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5044239, "tr_prof1": 0.49557605, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5425141, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.45748594, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.46716547, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.5328345, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.5571728, "headline_prof21": 0.44282728, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.48303816, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5169617999999999, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.5045457999999999, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.49545422, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.8273608, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.17263918, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": -2.540106951871657, "returnpredvader": 2.540106951871657, "returnpredsgd": -2.540106951871657, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9977998905900757, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0084708252131733, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9861611686141907, "cumreturn1b": 1.8912589247147886, "cumreturn1d": 1.217498676085719, "cumreturn1e": 1.3552999696068992, "cumreturndow": 1.200901986898101, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1718872024693667}, {"Unnamed: 0": 9048, "Unnamed: 0.1": 9048, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 9048, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 9048, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 9048, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 9048, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 9048, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 9048, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 9048, "level_0": 9048, "index": 9048, "text": "FILE PHOTO: THE COMPANY LOGO OF CHINA\u2019S SINOPEC CORP IS DISPLAYED AT A NEWS CONFERENCE IN HONG KONG, CHINA MARCH 26, 2018.

(REUTERS) - GENERAL MOTORS CO (GM.N) UNVEILED ON THURSDAY ITS NEWLY DESIGNED MID-ENGINE 2020 CORVETTE IN A SPLASHY TRIBUTE TO ITS EMBLEMATIC SPORTS CAR, EVEN AS THE NO. 1 U.S. AUTOMAKER FACES MOUNTING PRESSURES IN A SLUGGISH AND UNCERTAIN GLOBAL SALES ENVIRONMENT.  IN A GLITZY PRESENTATION IN ORANGE COUNTY OUTSIDE LOS ANGELES, THE EIGHTH GENERATION OF THE 66-YEAR-OLD \u201cVETTE,\u201d IN RED, WHITE, AND BLUE, ROARED DOWN A RUNWAY STOPPING SHORT BEFORE AN AUDIENCE OF CORVETTE ENTHUSIASTS, GM EXECUTIVES, DEALERS AND MEDIA.  REVVED UP TO TAKE ON HIGH-PERFORMANCE EUROPEAN RIVALS, THE NEW CORVETTE, DUBBED THE C8, PROVIDES A BREATH OF FRESH AIR TO GM, WHICH ALONG WITH OTHER CARMAKERS FACES SLOWING SALES AND NEW FINANCIAL PRESSURES RELATED TO GLOBAL TRADE, ELECTRIFICATION AND UNRESOLVED EMISSION STANDARDS.  WITH A 495 HORSEPOWER, V8 ENGINE AND DUAL CLUTCH, THE CORVETTE WILL GO FROM ZERO TO 60 MPH IN UNDER 3 SECONDS, EXECUTIVES SAID, ADDING THAT THE STARTING PRICE IN THE UNITED STATES WILL BE LESS THAN $60,000.  THE SPORTS CAR GIVES THE DETROIT AUTOMAKER A SORELY NEEDED SHOT IN THE ARM AFTER A DIFFICULT YEAR, EDMUNDS ANALYST JESSICA CALDWELL SAID.  \u201cA CORVETTE IS NOT GOING TO HELP PAD MARGINS THE WAY A SILVERADO WOULD,\u201d CALDWELL SAID. \u201cBUT FROM AN IMAGE AND EXCITEMENT STANDPOINT ...

SINCE 2013, GM HAS SOLD OVER 100,000 C7-MODEL CORVETTES IN THE UNITED STATES, ACCORDING TO EDMUNDS. THE CAR CEASED PRODUCTION THIS SUMMER.  BIDDING ADIEU TO THE FRONT-ENGINE CONFIGURATION THAT HAS MARKED THE TWO-SEATER SINCE ITS APPEARANCE IN 1953, GM HAS OPTED FOR A MID-ENGINE ARCHITECTURE FOR BETTER HANDLING AND WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION, THE CHOICE OF MANY EUROPEAN SPORTS CARMAKERS.  CORVETTE CHIEF ENGINEER TADGE JUECHTER SAID GM HAD REACHED THE LIMITS OF WHAT COULD BE DONE WITH THE FRONT ENGINE, BUT THAT THE NEW MID-ENGINE DESIGN ALLOWED A \u201cQUANTUM LEAP FORWARD IN DRIVING DYNAMICS.\u201d  FAR BELOW THE $113,000 STARTING PRICE FOR THE REAR-ENGINE PORSCHE 911, THE CORVETTE\u2019S OPENING PRICE OF UNDER $60,000 COULD ATTRACT A YOUNGER BUYER LURED IN RECENT YEARS TO HIGH PERFORMANCE VEHICLES FROM TESLA INC (TSLA.O) AND OTHERS.  ONE SUCH POTENTIAL CUSTOMER, WHO PROFESSED TO BE A TESLA FAN AS WELL, WAS JONATHAN OPATOWSKY, 22. HE DROVE THREE HOURS TO THE UNVEILING IN HIS DAD\u2019S 2017 GRAND SPORT - WITH HIS MOM IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.

REUTERS/MIKE BLAKE  OPATOWSKY, WHOSE FATHER WAS ABSENT DUE TO WORK, SAID HIS DAD FIRST LET HIM DRIVE HIS 2014 STINGRAY WHEN HE WAS ONLY 17.  \u201cHE WAS SHOCKED. HE DIDN\u2019T THINK I\u2019D BE ABLE TO DRIVE IT LIKE I DID,\u201d HE SAID.  THE LAUNCH  THE MASSIVE HANGAR WHERE THE GASOLINE-FUELED CORVETTE TOOK THE STAGE IS LESS THAN 40 MILES (64 KM) FROM TESLA\u2019S SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DESIGN CENTER, WHERE CHIEF EXECUTIVE ELON MUSK IN 2017 UNVEILED A PROTOTYPE OF A NEW ELECTRIC ROADSTER - DUBBED \u201cTHE QUICKEST CAR IN THE WORLD\u201d BY THE AUTOMAKER.  WHETHER THE CORVETTE CAN GENERATE ENOUGH EXCITEMENT TO ATTRACT EVEN THE LOYAL BUYERS OF THE PRICIER EUROPEAN BRANDS - FROM FERRARI, PORSCHE, LAMBORGHINI, ASTON MARTIN, MCCLAREN AND LOTUS - REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  GM HAS TEASED THE LAUNCH FOR MONTHS.  IN APRIL, JUECHTER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER MARY BARRA DROVE A CAMOUFLAGED C8 CORVETTE THROUGH NEW YORK\u2019S TIMES SQUARE DURING RUSH HOUR IN A HIGH-PROFILE TEASE.  ALMOST MYTHIC IN THE AMERICAN IMAGINATION, THE CAR HAS BEEN IMMORTALIZED IN TELEVISION AND FILM FROM \u201cROUTE 66\u201d AND \u201cHOT RODS TO HELL\u201d IN THE 1960S TO \u201cCORVETTE SUMMER\u201d IN 1978.

ONE ENTHUSIAST, JOHN ELEGANT, 72, SAID HE HAS BEEN WAITING SINCE HIS TEENAGE YEARS FOR A MID-ENGINE CORVETTE. OVER FOUR YEARS AGO, HE PUT DOWN A DEPOSIT WITH A DEALER FOR THE C8.  THE CO-FOUNDER OF HTTP://WWW.MIDENGINECORVETTEFORUM.COM AND CURRENT OWNER OF A CANARY YELLOW C7, ELEGANT PURCHASED HIS FIRST CORVETTE IN 1998 AFTER PUTTING HIS DAUGHTERS THROUGH COLLEGE.

THE COMPANY FACES CHALLENGES OF PAYING FOR AND ROLLING OUT THE TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS PERSUADING CONSUMERS TO LEAVE ENTRENCHED, BIGGER RIVALS THAT ARE MUCH BETTER KNOWN.  DISH FOUNDER CHARLIE ERGEN STEPPED DOWN FROM HIS ROLE AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE IN 2017 TO FOCUS ON BUILDING THE WIRELESS BUSINESS AND HAS REMAINED STEADFAST IN THE PROJECT DESPITE CONFUSION FROM ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS.  \u201cI\u2019M NOT GOING TO CONVINCE ANYBODY IN THIS CALL, SO I\u2019M GOING TO QUIT TALKING, RIGHT?\u201d ERGEN SAID DURING THE FIRST-QUARTER EARNINGS CALL AS ANALYSTS QUESTIONED THE WIRELESS STRATEGY. \u201cBUT JUST WATCH US OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS.\u201d  DISH HAS SAID IT WILL SPEND $10 BILLION ON THE SECOND PHASE OF ITS NETWORK BUILDOUT, A CUT RATE THAT CRAIG MOFFETT, AN ANALYST WITH MOFFETTNATHANSON, SAID WAS NOT POSSIBLE IN A RESEARCH NOTE ON THURSDAY.  VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS (VZ.N) SPENDS $15 BILLION ANNUALLY JUST TO MAINTAIN ITS EXISTING NETWORK, MOFFETT SAID.  \u201cTHE IDEA THAT DISH MIGHT SPEND $10B AND THEN SOMEHOW BE FINISHED IS, WELL, JUST SILLY,\u201d HE WROTE.  ANALYSTS WITH NEW STREET RESEARCH HAD A MORE POSITIVE VIEW OF DISH\u2019S CHANCES, GIVEN ITS NETWORK WILL BE BUILT FROM THE BEGINNING WITH 5G, THE NEW WIRELESS STANDARD JUST BEGINNING TO ROLL OUT.  WORKING WITH WIRELESS NETWORK ENGINEERS, NEW STREET DETERMINED THAT DISH\u2019S COSTS TO BUILD A NETWORK WOULD BE MUCH LOWER THAN COMPETITORS BECAUSE IT IS ONLY BUILDING ONE NETWORK, COMPARED TO RIVALS WHO HAVE TO MAINTAIN MULTIPLE NETWORKS, AND DISH\u2019S NETWORK WILL BE VIRTUAL AND CAN SAVE MONEY ON THE COSTS OF MAINTAINING PHYSICAL WIRELESS TOWERS.  ULTIMATELY, DISH\u2019S COST PER UNIT OF DATA WOULD BE 75% LOWER THAN VERIZON\u2019S AND 55% LOWER THAN AT&T AND T-MOBILE\u2019S, THE ANALYSTS SAID.  ON TOP OF THE $10 BILLION DISH SAID IT WILL SPEND TO BUILD THE NETWORK, IT NEEDS ANOTHER $10 BILLION TO FUND OPERATING LOSSES, NEW STREET SAID.  IN THE DEAL TERMS ANNOUNCED ON FRIDAY, DISH HAS NO RESTRICTIONS ON WHO IT CAN PARTNER WITH ON WIRELESS AS LONG AS IT CONTINUES TO OWN THE ASSETS, SAID JEFF BLUM, DISH\u2019S SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR PUBLIC POLICY AND GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS, IN AN INTERVIEW ON FRIDAY.  PREVIOUS PRESS REPORTS SAID T-MOBILE WANTED TO IMPOSE A 5% CAP ON STRATEGIC INVESTORS IN DISH.  DISH WILL HAVE NO TROUBLE IN FINDING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO BUILD ITS NETWORK, GIVEN THERE ARE MANY COMPANIES EAGER TO HELP IT TAKE ON THE THREE BIG INCUMBENTS, NEW STREET CALCULATED.  \u201cTHERE ARE A HOST OF DEEP POCKETED COMPANIES\u201d THAT WILL WANT TO SUPPORT DISH\u2019S EFFORTS, THE ANALYSTS WROTE, NAMING AMAZON.COM INC (AMZN.O) AND GOOGLE (GOOGL.O) AS TWO POSSIBLE PARTNERS.  REUTERS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT AMAZON WAS INTERESTED IN BUYING T-MOBILE ASSETS TO GET ACCESS TO ITS NETWORK.  THE NEW YORK POST PREVIOUSLY REPORTED GOOGLE WAS IN TALKS WITH DISH TO CREATE THE FOURTH CARRIER. GOOGLE SAID, \u201cTHESE CLAIMS ARE SIMPLY FALSE,\u201d IN THE REPORT.  DISH WILL NEED A PARTNER TO DEFRAY THE FINANCIAL RISKS, SAID ANALYSTS WITH RESEARCH FIRM COWEN IN A NOTE EARLIER THIS MONTH. AMAZON AND GOOGLE WOULD BE INTERESTED GIVEN THEIR WORK IN THE INTERNET OF THINGS AND CLOUD INDUSTRY, COWEN SAID.  DISH FOLLOWS IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF AT&T INC (T.N), WHICH HAS BOTH A SATELLITE TV AND WIRELESS PHONE BUSINESS. DISH COULD OFFER A SIMILAR PACKAGE BUNDLE OF TV AND WIRELESS, THE SAME WAY AT&T DOES.  UNDER FRIDAY\u2019S AGREEMENT, DISH WILL PAY $1.4 BILLION FOR SPRINT\u2019S PREPAID BUSINESS AND $3.6 BILLION THREE YEARS LATER TO BUY SPECTRUM LICENSES.  DISH WILL BE STARTING OFF WITH 9.3 MILLION USERS FROM SPRINT\u2019S PREPAID BUSINESS, COMPARED WITH U.S. CELLULAR, CURRENTLY THE FIFTH LARGEST CARRIER IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS ABOUT 5 MILLION USERS.

THE DISEASE HAS KILLED MORE THAN 1,800 PEOPLE IN THE CONGO OUTBREAK WHICH BEGAN A YEAR AGO AND HAS BECOME THE SECOND-WORST ON RECORD.  GSK SAID SABIN HAD AGREED A COLLABORATION DEAL WITH THE VACCINE RESEARCH CENTER AT THE U.S. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES (NIAID) TO FURTHER DEVELOP THE VACCINE CANDIDATES.  THE CHAD3 SHOT WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED BY NIAID IN COLLABORATION WITH THE SWISS-BASED FIRM OKAIROS, WHICH WAS BOUGHT BY GSK IN 2013.

THE HIRING PLANS ARE THE FIRST PUBLICLY DETAILED STEPS BOEING WILL TAKE AS IT WORKS TO DELIVER HUNDREDS OF GROUNDED 737 MAX JETS TO AIRLINES GLOBALLY, AN UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD AMOUNT TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST LOGISTICAL OPERATIONS IN MODERN CIVIL AVIATION.  CHICAGO-BASED BOEING HAS BEEN UNABLE TO DELIVER ANY 737 MAX AIRCRAFT SINCE THE SINGLE-AISLE PLANE WAS GROUNDED WORLDWIDE IN MARCH AFTER TWO FATAL CRASHES IN INDONESIA AND ETHIOPIA KILLED 346 PEOPLE, CUTTING OFF A KEY SOURCE OF CASH AND HITTING MARGINS.  GLOBAL AIRLINES HAVE HAD TO CANCEL THOUSANDS OF FLIGHTS AND USE SPARE AIRCRAFT TO COVER ROUTES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY FLOWN WITH THE FUEL-EFFICIENT MAX, EATING INTO THEIR PROFITABILITY. MANY CARRIERS HAVE TAKEN THE MAX OFF THEIR SCHEDULES LATE INTO THE FALL OR EARLY 2020.  BOEING REITERATED ON TUESDAY THAT IT WAS WORKING TOWARD GETTING THE 737 MAX FLYING AGAIN COMMERCIALLY IN THE \u201cEARLY FOURTH QUARTER\u201d AFTER IT WINS APPROVAL OF REPROGRAMMED SOFTWARE FOR THE STALL-PREVENTION SYSTEM AT THE CENTER OF BOTH CRASHES.

HUNDREDS OF BOEING 737 MAX JETS REMAIN GROUNDED WORLDWIDE, AND BOEING HAS CONTINUED BUILDING THE JETS AT A RATE OF 42 PER MONTH IN THE SEATTLE AREA. THE U.S. PLANEMAKER IS ALSO STORING FRESHLY BUILT AIRCRAFT OUTSIDE ITS FACTORIES IN RENTON AND EVERETT, AROUND SEATTLE. IT ALSO HAS JETS PARKED AT A FACILITY IN SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS.  THE TOTAL COST SO FAR OF THE 737 MAX CRISIS IS MORE THAN $8 BILLION, MAINLY DUE TO COMPENSATION THE PLANEMAKER WILL HAVE TO PAY AIRLINES FOR THE DELAYED DELIVERIES AND LOWER PRODUCTION.

FILE PHOTO: A SIGN IS SEEN OUTSIDE A BRANCH OF LLOYDS BANK IN CENTRAL LONDON FEBRUARY 3, 2014. REUTERS/LUKE MACGREGOR/FILE PHOTO  LLOYDS ON MONDAY SAID IT WILL SET ASIDE UP TO AN EXTRA 1.8 BILLION POUNDS ($2.2 BILLION) TO SETTLE PPI CLAIMS, WHILE BARCLAYS (BARC.L) LATER SAID IT WOULD SET ASIDE BETWEEN 1.2 BILLION POUNDS AND 1.6 BILLION POUNDS.  LLOYDS ALSO SAID IT WAS SUSPENDING ITS 2019 SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM.  THE HUGE PROVISIONS SHOW HOW BANKS IN BRITAIN ARE STILL BATTLING WITH THE LEGACY OF THE SCANDAL, EVEN AFTER THE AUG. 29 DEADLINE FOR CONSUMERS TO COMPLAIN, AS A RUSH OF CUSTOMER ENQUIRIES IN THE RUN-UP TO THAT DATE FORCED THEM TO SET ASIDE MORE COMPENSATION MONEY.  PPI POLICIES WERE SOLD ALONGSIDE A PERSONAL LOAN OR MORTGAGE TO COVER REPAYMENTS IF BORROWERS FELL ILL OR LOST JOBS, BUT MANY WERE UNSUITABLE.  BRITAIN\u2019S HIGH COURT IN 2011 RULED THAT CONSUMERS COULD RETROACTIVELY SEEK COMPENSATION FOR MIS-SOLD POLICIES.  THE SUBSEQUENT RUSH OF CLAIMS HAS BEEN A BOON FOR CONSUMERS, EGGED ON BY A RISE IN SO-CALLED CLAIMS MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, WITH LENDERS HAVING PAID OUT MORE THAN 36 BILLION POUNDS IN TOTAL AND THE FINAL TALLY EXPECTED TO TOP 50 BILLION POUNDS.  RBS (RBS.L) SAID LAST WEEK IT FACED ADDITIONAL COSTS OF UP TO 900 MILLION POUNDS, WHILE CLYDESDALE BANK MADE A FRESH 300-450 MILLION POUND PROVISION.  AS BRITAIN\u2019S BIGGEST DOMESTIC LENDER, LLOYDS HAS BEEN THE MOST EXPOSED TO PPI AND HAS ALREADY PAID OUT MORE THAN 20 BILLION POUNDS.  LAST MINUTE CLAIMS  LLOYDS SAID ON MONDAY IT HAD RECEIVED 600,000-800,000 REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT PPI PER WEEK IN AUGUST, WELL ABOVE ITS EXPECTATIONS OF AROUND 190,000 PER WEEK.  AS A RESULT, IT EXPECTS TO SET ASIDE A FURTHER 1.2-1.8 BILLION POUNDS IN ITS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS TO COVER PAYOUTS.  LLOYDS ALSO SAID IT HAD RECEIVED A CLAIM SUBMITTED BY THE INSOLVENCY SERVICE\u2019S OFFICIAL RECEIVER ON BEHALF OF BANKRUPT CONSUMERS, PUSHING COSTS HIGHER.  IT ADDED THE CHARGE WOULD DENT ITS PROFITABILITY AND IT SCRAPPED GUIDANCE FOR A RETURN ON TANGIBLE EQUITY OF AROUND 12% THIS YEAR. IT ALSO WARNED THE INCREASE IN ITS CAPITAL RATIO IN 2019 WOULD BE BELOW ITS 170-200 BASIS POINTS PER ANNUM GUIDANCE.  BARCLAYS SAID IT STILL AIMS TO HOLD ITS CORE CAPITAL LEVEL AT ITS 13% TARGET BY YEAR-END.  LLOYDS MADE PPI PROVISIONS WORTH 650 MILLION POUNDS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR, MEANING THE TOTAL COMBINED COST FOR 2019 COULD HIT AS MUCH AS 2.45 BILLION POUNDS, EQUIVALENT TO 41% OF ITS 6 BILLION POUNDS PRETAX PROFIT LAST YEAR. THE BANK SET ASIDE 750 MILLION POUNDS FOR PPI IN 2018.  ANALYSTS AT BROKER KBW SAID THE TOP END OF THE LLOYDS CHARGE AT 1.8 BILLION POUNDS WAS MARGINALLY BETTER THAN THEIR WORST CASE SCENARIO, WHILE THE BARCLAYS PROVISION WAS HIGHER THAN THE 700 MILLION POUNDS THEY HAD PREDICTED.  LLOYDS WAS GIVEN SOME BREATHING SPACE ON CAPITAL IN MAY, WHEN REGULATORS REDUCED ITS REQUIRED CORE CAPITAL RATIO TO 12.5% FROM 13%, EQUATING TO AROUND 1 BILLION POUNDS.  LLOYDS IS CONTINUING TO TARGET PAYING A DIVIDEND AND SAID IT WOULD MAKE A DECISION ON SURPLUS CAPITAL AT THE END OF THE YEAR.", "Ticker": "BCS", "Date": "2019-09-09T00:00:00", "key": "20190909BCS", "labelr0": 1.3100436681222687, "labelr1": 5.028735632183904, "labelr2": 0.6839945280437855, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 5.570652173913033, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.0, "0_day_return": 1.3100436681222627, "1_day_return": 5.0287356321839125, "2_day_return": 5.747126436781636, "3_day_return": 5.747126436781636, "4_day_return": 11.637931034482785, "label": 1, "return": 0.00032230437576734013, "excess_return": 5.028413327808145, "count_of_word": 564, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.49105042, "prof1": 0.5089496, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4923535060938622, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5076464939061378, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.49105042, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.5089496, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.4194339, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.5805661, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.4358361, "tr_prof1": 0.56416386, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.71390253, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.28609747, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5895246, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.41047528, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.55747813, "headline_prof21": 0.44252187, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.35088969999999997, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.64911026, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.2564342, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.74356586, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.65549445, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.34450546, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 5.0287356321839125, "returnpredvader": -5.0287356321839125, "returnpredsgd": 5.0287356321839125, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0070141813611906, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9944542197166866, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0016783861286478, "cumreturn1b": 2.3539502615658994, "cumreturn1d": 1.251066897466682, "cumreturn1e": 1.383939932217325, "cumreturndow": 1.1869937246077464, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1526236952197044}, {"Unnamed: 0": 11571, "Unnamed: 0.1": 11571, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 11571, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 11571, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 11571, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 11571, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 11571, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 11571, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 11571, "level_0": 11571, "index": 11571, "text": "LONDON (REUTERS) - SYSTEMS THAT SECURE BRITAIN\u2019S POWER SUPPLIES AND KEEP TRAINS RUNNING SHOULD BE REVIEWED AFTER A BLACKOUT CAUSED BY A LIGHTNING STRIKE AND UNEXPECTED POWER OUTAGES LAST MONTH CREATED TRAVEL CHAOS, THE GRID OPERATOR SAID ON TUESDAY.

FABIO SCHVARTSMAN, VALE\u2019S THEN-CHIEF EXECUTIVE, SAID AT A NATIONALLY BROADCAST NEWS CONFERENCE DAYS AFTER THE DAM BURST IN LATE JANUARY THAT THE COMPANY HAD ALREADY DECOMMISSIONED NINE \u201cUPSTREAM DAMS\u201d IN THE WAKE OF A 2015 DISASTER INVOLVING THE SAME TYPE OF STRUCTURE, AND PLANNED TO DISMANTLE 10 MORE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THE COMPANY REPEATED THE CLAIM IN A STATEMENT ON ITS WEBSITE.  REUTERS ASKED VALE FOR DETAILS ON THESE MOVES ON FEBRUARY 5, SEVEN DAYS AFTER SCHVARTSMAN\u2019S NEWS CONFERENCE.  IN MARCH, SOME FIVE WEEKS LATER, VALE GAVE REUTERS A LIST OF NINE DAMS THAT IT SAID IT HAD CLOSED SINCE 2014, A YEAR BEFORE THE MARIANA DISASTER. FIVE WERE SMALLER STRUCTURES, CALLED DIKES, WHICH VALE SAID SHOULD BE CONSIDERED \u201cUPSTREAM DAMS,\u201d WHILE FOUR OTHERS WERE LISTED AS SINGLE-STEP DAMS, WHICH EXPERTS CONSIDER LESS DANGEROUS.  BUT EDUARDO LE\u00c3O, A DIRECTOR OF THE BRAZILIAN MINING REGULATOR ANM, AND ANOTHER EXPERT WHO REVIEWED THE LIST FOR REUTERS, SAID THAT THEY WERE ALL IN FACT SMALLER STRUCTURES AND NOT THE DANGEROUS UPSTREAM TYPE.  VALE ALSO LISTED THE 10 DAMS THAT IT SAID IT PLANNED TO CLOSE, INCLUDING THE COLLAPSED ONE AT BRUMADINHO.  BRAZILIAN PROSECUTORS NOW ARE LOOKING INTO SCHVARTSMAN\u2019S DECLARATION THAT VALE HAD ALREADY SHUTTERED NINE UPSTREAM DAMS IN RESPONSE TO THE 2015 COLLAPSE AS PART OF A WIDER CRIMINAL PROBE INTO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONDUCT, AN INDIVIDUAL CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION SAID. THE WIDENING OF THE PROBE HAS NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED.  FOR A GRAPHIC, CLICK TMSNRT.RS/308R1IY  THE 2015 COLLAPSE, AT ITS SAMARCO JOINT VENTURE WITH BHP GROUP, KILLED 19 PEOPLE NEAR THE TOWN OF MARIANA.  \u201cTHERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT MEASURES BEING TAKEN TO AVOID A REPETITION OF WHAT HAPPENED, BUT IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN TALK,\u201d THE SOURCE ADDED.  SCHVARTSMAN\u2019S REPRESENTATIVES AT THE LAW FIRM OF BOTTINI & TAMASAUSKAS DECLINED TO COMMENT.  IN A STATEMENT, VALE SAID THE ORIGINAL FIGURES THAT SCHVARTSMAN PROVIDED WERE BASED ON \u201cINFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME, PROVIDED BY EMPLOYEES FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S FERROUS METALS AREA AT THE TIME OF THE (NEWS CONFERENCE) AND THAT IT HAD LATER SENT REVISED DATA TO REUTERS AND OTHER NEWS OUTLETS.\u201d  VALE SAID ITS STATEMENTS SURROUNDING THE DAMS HAD BEEN MADE IN GOOD FAITH, AND ADDED THAT IT HAD DONE A LOT TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE OF THE MARIANA DISASTER AND THAT MUCH \u201cIS STILL BEING DONE.\u201d  THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT ADDS TO THE MINING GIANT\u2019S LEGAL TROUBLES. BRAZILIAN PROSECUTORS HAVE SAID THEY ARE LOOKING INTO WHETHER SENIOR VALE EXECUTIVES WERE AWARE OF STABILITY ISSUES AT BRUMADINHO AND OTHER DAMS BUT FAILED TO DISCLOSE THEM OR TAKE ADEQUATE ACTIONS TO RESOLVE THEM.  BRAZILIAN MARKET REGULATOR CVM HAS ALSO OPENED AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIVE PROBES INTO VALE\u2019S HANDLING OF THE DISASTER, WHILE THE COMPANY FACES U.S. CLASS ACTIONS AND AT LEAST ONE INVESTOR ARBITRATION CASE IN BRAZIL.  MINING WATCHDOG ANM IS CARRYING OUT A SEPARATE INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES OF THE DAM BURST AS WELL AS WHETHER ANY MINING OR OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE RULES WERE BROKEN.  \u201cIN MY VIEW, IT\u2019S CLEAR THAT THE CEO OF ANY COMPANY, PUBLIC OR PRIVATE, WILL CERTAINLY BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY SHAREHOLDERS AND THE AUTHORITIES FOR ANY KIND OF STATEMENT, ESPECIALLY IF IT IS PROVEN TO BE UNTRUE,\u201d SAID LUIGI BONIZZATO, A PROFESSOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AT THE FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF RIO DE JANEIRO.  FOR A MULTIMEDIA VERSION OF THIS STORY, CLICK TMSNRT.RS/31NOCT7  DIFFERENT DAMS  VALE OPERATES SEVERAL DIFFERENT KINDS OF DAMS IN BRAZIL TO STORE THE MUDDY DETRITUS OF ITS MINING ACTIVITY KNOWN AS \"TAILINGS.\" THE TWO THAT COLLAPSED USED AN UPSTREAM TECHNIQUE IN WHICH THE DAM IS GRADUALLY BUILT UPON A RESERVOIR OF SLUDGE. FOR A GRAPHIC, CLICK TMSNRT.RS/31RIPR3  SUCH DAMS ARE GENERALLY CHEAPER TO BUILD, BUT THEY RUN A HIGHER RISK OF WATER SEEPING UNDER THE DAM AND WEAKENING THE STRUCTURE, MINING EXPERTS TOLD REUTERS.  CHILE AND PERU HAVE LONG BANNED THE CONSTRUCTION OF SUCH DAMS, BECAUSE OF THE RISKS OF COLLAPSE. IN FEBRUARY, BRAZIL\u2019S ANM BANNED NEW UPSTREAM TAILINGS DAMS AND TOLD MINERS THEY HAD TO DECOMMISSION EXISTING ONES BY AUG. 15, 2023, A DEADLINE IT RECENTLY PUSHED BACK BY AS MANY AS FOUR YEARS.  VALE, THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST IRON ORE EXPORTER, IS NOT THE ONLY BIG MINER THAT OPERATES UPSTREAM DAMS. AT BHP, FOR EXAMPLE, 43% OF ITS 67 OPERATED DAMS ARE UPSTREAM, ALTHOUGH ONLY FIVE OF THOSE ARE ACTIVE, ACCORDING TO A SLIDE PRESENTATION ON ITS WEBSITE FROM JUNE, WITH THE SOLE ACTIVE ONES AMONG THOSE BASED IN CHILE AND AUSTRALIA. BHP VERIFIED THAT THE NUMBERS WERE ACCURATE.  SCHVARTSMAN WAS REMOVED FROM THE CEO JOB IN EARLY MARCH AT THE URGING OF PROSECUTORS WHO SAID IN A LETTER TO THE BOARD THAT HIS AND OTHER TOP VALE EXECUTIVES\u2019 CONTINUED PRESENCE AT THE COMPANY POSED \u201cIMMEASURABLE RISKS TO SOCIETY.\u201d  IN MAY, THE COMPANY TOLD INVESTORS THAT IT EXPECTED TO SPEND $1.855 BILLION TO SHUTTER THE 10 UPSTREAM DAMS IT PLANNED TO CLOSE.  FOR NOW, THE COMPANY\u2019S DAMS CONTINUE TO POSE RISKS. IN MAY, ONE OF THE UPSTREAM DAMS SLATED TO BE DECOMMISSIONED, CALLED SUL SUPERIOR, CAME CLOSE TO BREAKING, BRAZILIAN REGULATORS AND VALE SAID, THREATENING TO FORCE THE EVACUATION OF 10,000 PEOPLE FROM THREE HISTORIC TOWNS.  VALE SAID THE DAM AT THAT MINE, KNOWN AS GONGO SOCO, WAS BEING MONITORED IN REAL TIME BY SYSTEMS CAPABLE OF DETECTING MILLIMETRIC MOVEMENTS, AS WELL AS BY DRONES. IT ADDED THAT THE COMPANY IN MAY STARTED BUILDING A CONCRETE CONTAINMENT WALL 6 KILOMETERS DOWNSTREAM FROM THE DAM THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO HOLD BACK A LARGE PORTION OF THE TAILINGS IF THE DAM COLLAPSED.", "Ticker": "VALE", "Date": "2019-09-17T00:00:00", "key": "20190917VALE", "labelr0": 0.5054759898904845, "labelr1": -1.341156747694888, "labelr2": -1.6142735768903953, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": -0.9499136442141576, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.256, "compound": -0.4767, "0_day_return": 0.5054759898904804, "1_day_return": -1.3411567476948827, "2_day_return": -2.933780385582552, "3_day_return": -2.933780385582552, "4_day_return": -3.855825649622792, "label": -1, "return": 0.0003426918910043969, "excess_return": -1.3414994395858868, "count_of_word": 986, "pred": -1, "prof-1": 0.44962156, "prof1": 0.5503785, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4650159664567554, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5349840335432446, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.44962156, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.5503785, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.57395005, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.42605, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5197579000000001, "tr_prof1": 0.48024207, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.565681, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.434319, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.628763, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.371237, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.6551534000000001, "headline_prof21": 0.34484664, "textplusheadline_pred": -1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.5200014000000001, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.47999853, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.77258795, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.22741203, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.78262776, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.21737228, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 1.3411567476948827, "returnpredvader": 1.3411567476948827, "returnpredsgd": -1.3411567476948827, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0027553925659654, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9978177414615728, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0024799277407443, "cumreturn1b": 2.416255922842681, "cumreturn1d": 1.2214236241157166, "cumreturn1e": 1.4095269123227387, "cumreturndow": 1.1978860592348712, "cumreturnsp500": 1.162803081177273}, {"Unnamed: 0": 11885, "Unnamed: 0.1": 11885, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 11885, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 11885, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 11885, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 11885, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 11885, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 11885, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 11885, "level_0": 11885, "index": 11885, "text": "THE XFINITY FLEX PERSONALIZED GUIDE SCREEN, REMOTE AND BOX ARE SEEN IN AN UNDATED PHOTO COURTESY OF COMCAST RELEASED TO REUTERS ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2019.

FILE PHOTO: A MAN WALKS PAST AN OFFICE OF DEUTSCHE BANK IN HANAU, GERMANY, APRIL 27, 2015. REUTERS/KAI PFAFFENBACH  THE DISCUSSIONS IN RECENT WEEKS, WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, ARE PRELIMINARY, THE SOURCES SAID, ADDING THAT THERE IS NOTHING IMMINENT. A DEUTSCHE BANK SPOKESMAN SAID THE BANK HAS NO PLANS TO ADD ADDITIONAL ASSETS INTO THE SO-CALLED CAPITAL RELEASE UNIT, OR BAD BANK.  NEVERTHELESS, IT IS ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT HAS COME UP FOR DISCUSSION AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS AT THE BANK, AS EXECUTIVES GRAPPLE WITH THE PROBLEM OF HAVING TO TURN AROUND THE BANK ON A TIGHT BUDGET, ACCORDING TO THE THREE PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE TALKS.  DEUTSCHE BANK NEEDS MORE CAPITAL TO BE ABLE TO ABSORB THE LOSSES THAT WILL LIKELY COME FROM SHEDDING PROBLEMATIC ASSETS, SUCH AS LONG-DATED DERIVATIVES, THAT ARE STILL ON ITS BOOKS, THE PEOPLE SAID.  BUT, AFTER RAISING 29.3 BILLION EUROS ($32.3 BILLION) IN CAPITAL OVER THE PAST NINE YEARS, IT DOES NOT HAVE ROOM TO ASK INVESTORS FOR MORE, THE SOURCES ADDED.  FOR INVESTORS, STILL NURSING A 75% FALL IN THE BANK\u2019S SHARE PRICE OVER THE PAST FOUR-AND-A-HALF YEARS, IT MEANS THAT THE ROAD TO RECOVERY FOR THE BANK WILL MOST LIKELY BE LONG.  CHRISTIAN SEWING, WHO TOOK OVER FROM JOHN CRYAN IN APRIL LAST YEAR, IS LOOKING TO RESHAPE DEUTSCHE BANK AFTER A MULTI-YEAR BET ON BUILDING A GLOBAL INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS UNRAVELED.  IN JULY, HE SET UP THE BAD BANK, CALLED A CAPITAL RELEASE UNIT (CRU), TO HOUSE 74 BILLION EUROS OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS THE BANK HAD IDENTIFIED FOR WIND-DOWN OR SALE, PART OF A BROADER RESTRUCTURING THAT WILL SEE 18,000 JOBS GO AS IT EXITS UNPROFITABLE BUSINESSES. DEUTSCHE BANK SET ASIDE A 7.4 BILLION EURO BUDGET TO FUND THE RESTRUCTURING.  SOME ANALYSTS HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL WHETHER THE PLAN FULLY RECOGNIZES THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM ASSETS STILL SITTING ON DEUTSCHE BANK\u2019S BALANCE SHEET. THEY REMAIN PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EXPOSURE TO LEVEL 3 ASSETS, WHICH ARE THE MOST ILLIQUID AND HARD-TO-VALUE.  \u201cIT\u2019S A PARTIAL CLEAN-UP,\u201d SAID DAVID HENDLER, AN INDEPENDENT ANALYST AT NEW YORK-BASED VIOLA RISK ADVISORS. HENDLER ADDED THAT DEUTSCHE BANK HAS 18 BILLION EUROS IN HARD-TO-VALUE ASSETS ON ITS BALANCE SHEET, WHICH HE ESTIMATED WILL TAKE YEARS TO OFFLOAD.  \u201cTHEY\u2019RE TRYING TO PAINT A PICTURE OF PROGRESS BUT THERE\u2019S STILL A LOT OF SLUDGE IN THERE,\u201d HE SAID.  LEVEL 3 ASSETS, WHICH CAN INCLUDE DISTRESSED DEBT AND DERIVATIVES, ARE NOT NECESSARILY LOSS MAKING.  DEUTSCHE BANK HAS SAID THAT THE CRU\u2019S FOCUS IS ON RELEASING CAPITAL RATHER THAN RING-FENCING TOXIC ASSETS. IN A MEMO TO STAFF ON JULY 8, SEWING DESCRIBED THE ASSETS WITHIN IT AS \u201cHIGH QUALITY\u201d AND SAID MOST WERE OF A SHORT DURATION.  ONLY 30% OF DEUTSCHE BANK\u2019S 25 BILLION EUROS WORTH OF LEVEL 3 ASSETS HAVE SO FAR BEEN PLACED WITHIN THE CAPITAL RELEASE UNIT, ACCORDING TO A PRESENTATION THE BANK GAVE ALONGSIDE ITS QUARTERLY RESULTS IN JULY.  THE BANK HAS TRIED TO SHED SOME OF THOSE ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDE LONGER-DATED DERIVATIVES, OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. BUT IT HAD LITTLE SUCCESS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT PREPARED TO TAKE THE WRITEDOWNS THE SALES WOULD HAVE REQUIRED, THE SOURCES SAID.  A SALE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET CAN LEAD TO A CAPITAL HIT IF THE PRICE IS BELOW WHAT THE BANK VALUES IT AT ON ITS BOOKS, LEADING TO A LOSS.  DEUTSCHE BANK MUST STAY WITHIN THE BUDGET IT HAS SET FOR ITS RESTRUCTURING TO AVOID HAVING TO RAISE FUNDS FROM INVESTORS, THE SOURCES SAID.

REUTERS/SERGIO MORAES  NOW, BRAZIL\u2019S MOST IMPORTANT COMPANY IS FACING YET ANOTHER CHALLENGE: THIEVES ARE ROBBING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF ITS FUEL TO SELL ON A THRIVING BLACK MARKET.  THEFT FROM PETROBRAS PIPELINES SOARED TO A RECORD HIGH 261 INCIDENTS IN THE STATES OF RIO DE JANEIRO AND SAO PAULO LAST YEAR, UP FROM JUST ONE CASE IN 2014, ACCORDING TO AN AUGUST SECURITIES FILING AND STATEMENTS MADE TO REUTERS BY REPRESENTATIVES OF PETROLEO BRASILEIRO SA (PETR4.SA), AS THE COMPANY IS FORMALLY KNOWN.  MOST OF THOSE HEISTS, POLICE SAY, ARE THE WORK OF SOPHISTICATED CRIMINAL GROUPS, SOME WITH THEIR OWN TRUCKS, DISTRIBUTION FIRMS AND EVEN RETAIL GAS STATIONS.  \u201cTHEY\u2019RE CREATIVE CREATURES,\u201d SAID JULIO DA SILVA FILHO, THE HEAD OF A RIO POLICE UNIT THAT INVESTIGATES OIL THEFT.  CRIME COSTS PETROBRAS\u2019 DISTRIBUTION SUBSIDIARY, PETROBRAS TRANSPORTE SA, OR TRANSPETRO, OVER 150 MILLION REAIS ($37 MILLION) PER YEAR, PETROBRAS CHIEF EXECUTIVE ROBERTO CASTELLO BRANCO SAID AT AN EVENT IN JUNE.  THE ALLEGED LOSSES ARE TINY COMPARED TO THOSE OF ANOTHER LATIN AMERICAN ENERGY POWERHOUSE - MEXICO - WHERE CRIME GANGS HAVE INFILTRATED THE PETROLEUM BUSINESS IN A BIG WAY. FUEL THEFT COSTS STATE-RUN PEMEX OVER $3 BILLION ANNUALLY, ACCORDING TO COMPANY FIGURES.  BUT STAMPING OUT BRAZIL\u2019S PROBLEMS EARLY, DA SILVA SAID, WILL BE CRUCIAL TO KEEPING GANGSTERS FROM BECOMING ENTRENCHED IN ITS OIL INDUSTRY.  \u201cWE\u2019RE WORKING EXACTLY TO PREVENT BRAZIL FROM TURNING INTO MEXICO,\u201d HE SAID.  TRANSPETRO HAS SET UP A PROGRAM TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE ON CRIMINAL GROUPS AND IS SPENDING 100 MILLION REAIS ($24 MILLION) A YEAR TO FUND IT, ACCORDING A HIGH-RANKING COMPANY SOURCE, WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY TO AVOID RETALIATION FROM ORGANIZED CRIME GROUPS.  AROUND 50 STAFFERS ARE NOW STUDYING THE ISSUE, INCLUDING TRACKING THE PATTERNS AND METHODS OF OIL THIEVES AND SHARING THOSE FINDINGS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE PERSON SAID. THE COMPANY, WHICH DID NOT RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT, HAS ALSO SET UP A HOTLINE FOR THE PUBLIC TO REPORT FUEL ROBBERY.  SOME FOREIGN INVESTORS, TOO, ARE BEEFING UP SECURITY. THEY INCLUDE TAG, A PIPELINE UNIT THAT FRANCE\u2019S ENGIE SA (ENGIE.PA) BOUGHT FROM PETROBRAS FOR $8.6 BILLION IN APRIL.  THE FIRM TOLD REUTERS IN A STATEMENT THAT IT IS WORKING WITH TRANSPETRO, WHOSE PIPELINES OFTEN RUN BESIDE TAG\u2019S PIPES, TO INCREASE FOOT PATROLS AND REINFORCE PHYSICAL BARRIERS, AMONG OTHER MEASURES.  \u201cTHIS PHENOMENON IS BECOMING VERY ORGANIZED,\u201d SAID EMMANUEL DELFOSSE, TAG\u2019S CHIEF OPERATIONAL OFFICER. \u201cIT\u2019S HARD TO GO AFTER THESE PEOPLE.\u201d  CRIMES OF OPPORTUNITY  FUEL IS AN EXPENSIVE COMMODITY IN BRAZIL, WHERE THE PUMP PRICE OF GASOLINE WORKS OUT TO MORE THAN $4 A GALLON.  CRIME GANGS TRADITIONALLY FOCUSED ON NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING HAVE BRANCHED OUT INTO FUEL THEFT IN RECENT YEARS, ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES. SO HAVE SO-CALLED MILITIAS, POLICE SAY, WHICH SPRANG UP TO BATTLE DRUG GANGS BUT HAVE MORPHED INTO FEARSOME CRIME OUTFITS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT.  THESE GROUPS ARE HIGHLY ORGANIZED, WITH SEPARATE DIVISIONS DEDICATED TO TAPPING ILLEGALLY INTO PIPELINES, TRANSPORTING THE STOLEN FUEL AND KEEPING A LOOKOUT FOR COPS, SAID SIMONE SIBILIO, THE HEAD PROSECUTOR FOR RIO STATE\u2019S ORGANIZED CRIME UNIT.  SHE SAID GANGSTERS FENCE THE PRODUCT THROUGH FIRMS SUCH AS ASPHALT COMPANIES WHOSE OPERATIONS REQUIRE LARGE AMOUNTS OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. THEY ALSO SELL TO UNSCRUPULOUS GAS STATION OWNERS, UNDERCUTTING LEGAL COMPETITORS ON PRICE, AUTHORITIES SAID.  CROOKS HAVE ALSO MUSCLED INTO RETAIL SALES. POLICE SAY CRIMINALS ENTERED THE GAS STATION BUSINESS YEARS AGO AS A MEANS OF LAUNDERING CASH FROM OTHER ILLICIT OPERATIONS. NOW, STOCKING THOSE PUMPS WITH STOLEN FUEL HAS BECOME A LUCRATIVE NEW PROFIT CENTER, AUTHORITIES SAID.  FIRST CAPITAL COMMAND, ONE OF BRAZIL\u2019S MOST NOTORIOUS CRIME GANGS, CONTROLS AROUND 300 GAS STATIONS IN SAO PAULO STATE, ACCORDING TO PAULO MIRANDA, HEAD OF THE GAS STATION INDUSTRY GROUP FECOMBUSTIVEIS. THAT COMES TO AROUND 3% OF THE STATE\u2019S APPROXIMATELY 9,000 GAS STATIONS.  \u201cIT\u2019S A FUEL MAFIA,\u201d MIRANDA SAID.  FIGHTING BACK  PETROBRAS CEO CASTELLO BRANCO HAS CALLED FOR HARSHER SENTENCES FOR PIPELINE ATTACKERS TO REDUCE FUEL THEFT.  THE FIRM IS ALSO CLOSE TO SIGNING FORMAL AGREEMENTS WITH MEXICO\u2019S PEMEX AND COLOMBIA\u2019S ECOPETROL ECO.CN TO FACILITATE THE SHARING OF ANTI-THEFT STRATEGIES, THE TRANSPETRO SOURCE SAID.  NONE OF THOSE COMPANIES RESPONDED TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT.  IN THE MEANTIME, HEIGHTENED VIGILANCE APPEARS TO BE PAYING OFF. THROUGH THE END OF JULY, FUEL HEISTS IN BRAZIL WERE DOWN 33% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, PETROBRAS SECURITIES FILINGS SHOW, THOUGH THEY REMAIN HIGH BY HISTORICAL STANDARDS.  LUCAS TRIST\u00c3O, SECRETARY OF DEVELOPMENT FOR RIO STATE, SAID AUTHORITIES HAVE SHUT DOWN 10 GAS STATIONS IN RIO FOR VARIOUS CRIMES IN 2019.  SLIDESHOW (5 IMAGES)  IN JULY, POLICE BLEW THE LID OFF AN EXTORTION RACKET AT A PETROBRAS REFINERY NORTHEAST OF RIO, WHERE TRIST\u00c3O ALLEGES A LOCAL MILITIA WAS DEMANDING KICKBACKS FROM CONTRACTORS AT THE COMPLEX.  GABRIEL POIAVA, ONE OF THE DETECTIVES ON THAT CASE, SAID IT\u2019S AN EXAMPLE OF GANGSTERS LOOKING UP AND DOWN BRAZIL\u2019S OIL SUPPLY CHAIN TO SEE WHERE THEY COULD GRAB A PIECE OF THE RICHES.  \u201cIF THEY BELIEVED SOME ACTIVITY COULD BE EXTORTED THERE, THEY WOULD TRY,\u201d HE SAID.", "Ticker": "PBR", "Date": "2019-09-20T00:00:00", "key": "20190920PBR", "labelr0": 0.06882312456985401, "labelr1": 0.1375515818432005, "labelr2": -1.0989010989011, "labelr3": 0.4166666666666701, "labelr4": 0.7607192254495119, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.669, "compound": -0.7964, "0_day_return": 0.06882312456986117, "1_day_return": 0.06882312456986117, "2_day_return": -0.9628610729023211, "3_day_return": -0.5502063273727487, "4_day_return": 0.20632737276480287, "label": 1, "return": -9.69358983607796e-05, "excess_return": 0.06892006046822195, "count_of_word": 891, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5742465999999999, "prof1": 0.4257534000000001, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5185145914415188, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4814854085584812, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5742465999999999, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.4257534000000001, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.4096665, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.59033346, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.50816005, "tr_prof1": 0.49183995, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.6095813, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.39041865, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.6942786999999999, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.30572128, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.64618665, "headline_prof21": 0.35381338, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.44807762, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5519223000000001, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.36945742, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.6305425, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.4383223, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.5616777, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -0.06882312456986117, "returnpredvader": -0.06882312456986117, "returnpredsgd": -0.06882312456986117, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0013789648633076, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.000692593385423, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0024850344265908, "cumreturn1b": 2.4507141491359206, "cumreturn1d": 1.2284494559440078, "cumreturn1e": 1.421238109472952, "cumreturndow": 1.1919299747150554, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1543610433148777}, {"Unnamed: 0": 12051, "Unnamed: 0.1": 12051, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 12051, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 12051, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 12051, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 12051, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12051, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12051, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12051, "level_0": 12051, "index": 12051, "text": "(REPEATS SEPT 20 STORY WITHOUT ANY CHANGES TO TEXT)    GOVERNMENT WANTS MORE LENDING TO BOOST RECOVERY    REGULATOR ASKED BANKS \u2018ONE LAST TIME\u2019 TO DEAL WITH SOURED DEBT    ANKARA LOST PATIENCE AFTER MONTHS OF TALKS, NO PROGRESS    LAST-MINUTE PLAN TO PARK LOANS IN AN ASSET MGR FAILED TO IMPRESS    STATE BANKS COULD BENEFIT FROM HIGHER NPL RATIOS  BY ORHAN COSKUN, EBRU TUNCAY, CAN SEZER AND JONATHAN SPICER  ISTANBUL/ANKARA, SEPT 20 (REUTERS) - TURKEY FORCED BANKS TO TAKE LOSSES ON $8 BILLION IN BAD LOANS THIS WEEK TO KICK-START LENDING AND BOOST ITS ECONOMIC RECOVERY AFTER LOSING PATIENCE WITH THEM, BANKERS, SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND INDUSTRY ADVISERS TOLD REUTERS.  ANKARA\u2019S MOST AGGRESSIVE MOVE YET TO CURE A HANGOVER FROM TURKEY\u2019S 2018 CURRENCY CRISIS HAS LEFT BANKS SCRAMBLING TO MEET A YEAR-END DEADLINE TO RESTRUCTURE LOANS OR READY THEM FOR SALE.  TURKEY'S BANK WATCHDOG HAD BEEN CALLING BANK EXECUTIVES IN RECENT WEEKS, AFTER THREE MONTHS OF TALKS FAILED TO DELIVER ACTION, TO TELL THEM WHAT PORTION OF LOANS THEY SHOULD RECLASSIFY AS NON-PERFORMING TMSNRT.RS/2OA8LLL AND TO MAKE PROVISIONS, TWO SOURCES SAID.  ON TUESDAY, A YEAR ON FROM THE DARKEST MOMENTS OF THE CURRENCY CRISIS, THE BDDK WATCHDOG WENT PUBLIC WITH ITS REQUIREMENT FOR BANKS TO WRITE OFF LOANS TOTALLING 46 BILLION LIRA ($8.1 BILLION) AS NON-PERFORMING LOANS (NPLS).  THE MOVE WAS DRIVEN BY THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S DESIRE FOR BANKS, ESPECIALLY MORE CAUTIOUS PRIVATE ONES, TO EXTEND MORE CREDIT AND HELP MEET PRESIDENT TAYYIP ERDOGAN\u2019S GOAL OF 5% ECONOMIC GROWTH NEXT YEAR, FIVE SOURCES SAID.  \u201cTHE GOVERNMENT HAS LOST PATIENCE AND WANTS ACTION. WE KNEW THAT NOTHING WAS HAPPENING IN AUGUST, SO IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF WHO WAS GOING TO LOSE PATIENCE FIRST,\u201d ONE OF THE SOURCES, A SENIOR BANKER INVOLVED IN TALKS WITH THE BDDK AND GOVERNMENT, TOLD REUTERS.  THE BANKS HAD HOPED TURKEY\u2019S TREASURY MINISTRY WOULD DO MORE TO SHIELD THEM FROM LOSSES, TELLING THE BDDK AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THAT FISCAL POLICIES HAD IN PART LED TO THE DOWNTURN, A SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AND THE SENIOR BANKER SAID.  THE BDDK REFERRED REUTERS TO ITS STATEMENT ON TUESDAY, WHILE THE TREASURY DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE BDDK MOVE.  AMONG THE BIG PRIVATE BANKS LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY THE CHANGE, ANALYSTS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED YAPI KREDI AND GARANTI BBVA, WHOSE SHARES BOTH SLIPPED THIS WEEK.  NEITHER BANK WAS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE TO COMMENT ON NPLS.  THE 2018 CRISIS SLICED 30% OFF THE VALUE OF THE TURKISH LIRA, ENDED YEARS OF A CONSTRUCTION-DRIVEN BOOM FUELLED BY CHEAP FOREIGN CREDIT, AND SENT INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES SOARING.  TURKEY\u2019S $766 BILLION ECONOMY SLIPPED INTO A RECESSION THAT HAS STRETCHED INTO 2019, LEAVING BANKS WITH SOME $20 BILLION OF DEBT THAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENERGY FIRMS CAN NO LONGER SERVICE.  DURING WEEKS OF CALLS WITH THE REGULATOR, THE BANKS SOUGHT BROADER \u201cSTRUCTURAL CHANGES\u201d AND PROPOSED MERGING OR CANCELLING PROJECTS UNDERPINNING SOME OF THE LOANS, THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID.  THE SENIOR BANKER SAID LENDERS WARNED AGAINST FORCING THEM TO RECOGNISE LOSSES ON SUCH LARGE EXPOSURES BEFORE YEAR-END, PREFERRING INSTEAD TO SPREAD THEM OVER SEVERAL YEARS.  BUT THE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT CONVINCED.  \u201cTHE FOCUS FOR BOTH THE BDDK AND THE TREASURY IS FOR BANKS TO HAVE A TRANSPARENT, PLAIN BALANCE SHEET SO THEY CAN START LENDING AGAIN,\u201d A DEBT RESTRUCTURING CONSULTANT INVOLVED IN THE PRIVATE TALKS TOLD REUTERS ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY.  OUT OF TIME  ANKARA WAS IRRITATED THAT EFFORTS LED MOSTLY BY BANKS TO AGREE A FUND-OF-FUNDS TO MOP UP THE BAD DEBT HAD STALLED OVER THE SPRING AND SUMMER, REUTERS REPORTED IN JULY.  AND IT WAS NOT ENOUGH THAT THE BIGGEST BANKS HAD IN RECENT WEEKS ZEROED IN ON A NEW PLAN FOR AN ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY TO TAKE ON HIGHER-QUALITY NPLS, TWO SOURCES SAID.  SUCH A PLAN WOULD TAKE TIME AND THE BDDK WAS NOT ABOUT TO HOLD OFF ON ITS NPL ANNOUNCEMENT, THEY SAID.  IN GROUP AND BILATERAL TALKS BETWEEN THE BDDK AND BANKS THAT BEGAN IN JUNE, IT ASKED THEM \u201cONE LAST TIME\u201d TO RESTRUCTURE OR CONVERT THE MOSTLY STAGE 2 LOANS TO NPLS, THE SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID.  A STAGE 2 LOAN IS ONE WHERE THE RISK OF NONPAYMENT HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY.  \u201cBUT THE EXPECTED ACTION DID NOT MATERIALIZE, THUS THE (TUESDAY) STATEMENT,\u201d THE OFFICIAL ADDED. \u201cBANKS ARE BEING ASKED TO EXTEND MORE LOANS... AND OF COURSE TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE IN RESTRUCTURING OF PROBLEM LOANS.\u201d  THE TREASURY \u201cTHINKS IT IS THE BANKS\u2019 LACK OF APPETITE FOR LOANS THAT IS HOLDING BACK THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY,\u201d SAID A DEBT RESTRUCTURING CONSULTANT INVOLVED IN THE TALKS.  TURKEY\u2019S CENTRAL BANK, UNDER PRESSURE FROM ERDOGAN TO DO ITS BIT TO BOOST RECOVERY, HAS CUT INTEREST RATES BY 750 BASIS POINTS IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS AND MOVED TO RELIEVE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ON BANKS THAT RAMP UP LENDING.  \u201cTHE GOVERNMENT IS TAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS TO SUPPORT GROWTH, (AND) NEW STEPS AND ADJUSTMENTS WILL COME, BUT PRIVATE BANKS MUST REALLY GIVE STRONGER SUPPORT,\u201d A SECOND GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID.  CREDIT CONUNDRUM  ANALYSTS HAVE FLAGGED THE RISKS OF FORCING CREDIT EXPANSION ON AN ECONOMY THAT WAS STILL CONTRACTING YEAR-ON-YEAR IN THE SECOND QUARTER, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE FEW IF ANY STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO RELY LESS ON FOREIGN FUNDING.  \u201cTHE MOVE HIGHLIGHTS, ONCE AGAIN, THAT CREDIT GROWTH RATHER THAN A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF STRUCTURAL REFORMS REMAINS THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PREFERRED APPROACH TO SUPPORT TURKEY\u2019S AILING ECONOMY,\u201d SAID WOLFANGO PICCOLI, CO-PRESIDENT OF TENEO, A RISK CONSULTANCY.  THE FIRST GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID ONE MOTIVATION FOR THE BDDK MOVE WAS THAT INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND OFFICIALS VISITED TURKEY THIS MONTH TO PREPARE AN ANNUAL REPORT, WHICH WILL NOW INCLUDE THE 46 BILLION-LIRA FIGURE. LAST YEAR, THE IMF REQUESTED MORE PRECISE DATA ON NPLS, THE OFFICIAL SAID.  OTHERS PRAISED THE BDDK FOR SHINING A LIGHT ON THE SIZE OF TURKEY\u2019S BAD DEBT PROBLEM, AND ESTIMATED IT WOULD TRIM BANKS\u2019 EARNINGS BY ABOUT 20% THIS YEAR. THE BDDK SAID BANKS\u2019 NPL RATIO WOULD RISE TO 6.3% BY YEAR END, FROM 4.6%.  AND WHILE TURKISH BANKS HAVE RESISTED OVERTURES ALL YEAR FROM POTENTIAL NPL BUYERS, THAT MAY CHANGE. \u201cBANKS CAN NOW AT LEAST SAY HOW MANY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR THEY ARE WILLING TO SELL FOR,\u201d SAID A SECOND SENIOR BANKER.  BUT THE CONSULTANT SAID BANKS WERE MORE LIKELY TO ACCELERATE RESTRUCTURING SO THEY \u201cCAN GET AWAY WITH SETTING ASIDE LESS PROVISIONS FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES.\u201d  WHILE AN INDEX OF TURKISH BANKS HAS FALLEN 2.3% SINCE THE BDDK\u2019S ANNOUNCEMENT, STATE BANKS, WHICH SHOULDERED A BUMP IN LENDING IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, MAY SEE SOME BENEFITS.

FILE PHOTO: THE NBC AND COMCAST LOGOS ARE DISPLAYED ON 30 ROCKEFELLER PLAZA IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN IN NEW YORK, U.S., FEBRUARY 27, 2018. REUTERS/LUCAS JACKSON/FILE PHOTO  BEHIND THE CLOSED DOORS OF A CONGRESSIONAL TASK FORCE LAST MONTH, COMCAST\u2019S VIDEO ADS DIVISION FREEWHEEL ACCUSED ALPHABET INC\u2019S GOOGLE OF USING PRIVACY CONCERNS AS A PRETEXT TO LIMIT FREEWHEEL\u2019S ABILITY TO SELL ADS ON BEHALF OF ITS CLIENTS\u2019 YOUTUBE CHANNELS, FOUR PEOPLE BRIEFED ON THE DISCUSSION SAID.  COMCAST MAY BE DRAWING A LINE IN THE SAND AND WANTS TO AVOID LETTING GOOGLE DO TO THE VIDEO AD BUSINESS WHAT IT HAS DONE TO THE ONLINE AD MARKET.  IT IS THE FIRST TIME ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH ITS OWN MUSCULAR LOBBYING APPARATUS IN WASHINGTON, IS TAKING SIDES IN THE ANTITRUST BATTLE LOOMING OVER THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SELLER OF ONLINE ADS. GOOGLE\u2019S COMPETITORS ARE WARNING LAWMAKERS THAT EMERGING PRIVACY REGULATIONS COULD HELP GOOGLE EXTEND ITS DOMINANCE.  \u201cFREEWHEEL WOULD EMBRACE A SOLUTION THAT ALLOWED IT TO CONTINUE TO MEANINGFULLY SERVE ITS CLIENTS WHEN THEY PUBLISH THEIR CONTENT ON YOUTUBE, AS IT HAD FOR OVER A DECADE ON THAT PLATFORM,\u201d COMCAST SAID IN A STATEMENT. \u201cUNFORTUNATELY, THE ACTIONS TO REMOVE OR DEGRADE FREEWHEEL\u2019S CAPABILITIES ON YOUTUBE FALL WELL SHORT OF THAT.\u201d  COMCAST\u2019S CONCERNS HAVE NOT PROMPTED A FULL-ON ATTACK ON GOOGLE, THOUGH COMCAST HAS CONTACTED OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES TO DISCUSS THE THREAT POSED BY GOOGLE, TWO OTHER SOURCES SAID.  THE ISSUES RAISED BY COMCAST AND ITS SUBSIDIARY HAVE BEEN ECHOED WIDELY IN THE CABLE AND AD TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES. MOST COMPANIES THAT CONTEND GOOGLE HAS UNFAIRLY SQUEEZED THEM OUT HAVE BEEN RETICENT TO SPEAK OUT BECAUSE THEY RELY ON GOOGLE SERVICES AND FEAR RETALIATION.  BUT COMCAST, WHICH OWNS MEDIA COMPANY NBC, UNIVERSAL PICTURES AND THE XFINITY INTERNET SERVICE, IS A LARGE SPENDER ON STATE AND FEDERAL LOBBYING AND ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND A VETERAN OF POLITICAL ORGANIZING.  THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND A COALITION OF 50 STATE-LEVEL ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE EACH ASKED GOOGLE FOR INFORMATION ABOUT ITS ADS BUSINESS IN RECENT WEEKS AS THEY BEGIN INVESTIGATING POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF ANTITRUST LAW.  GOOGLE DECLINED TO COMMENT ON COMCAST\u2019S RECENT ACTIONS BUT HAS SAID IT IS COOPERATING WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS AND THAT IT FACES ROBUST COMPETITION IN ADVERTISING, INCLUDING FROM COMCAST.  PRIVACY PUSH  FREEWHEEL\u2019S TENSIONS WITH GOOGLE STEM FROM A ONE-OF-A-KIND AGREEMENT STRUCK IN 2009 AS YOUTUBE SOUGHT TO BURNISH ITS IMAGE WITH CLIPS FROM WELL-KNOWN TV CHANNELS.  THE DEAL ENABLES MEDIA COMPANIES SUCH AS NBC, TURNER, NOW OWNED BY AT&T INC, AND VIACOM INC TO SELL ADS ALONGSIDE THEIR CONTENT ON YOUTUBE USING FREEWHEEL\u2019S TECHNOLOGY RATHER THAN GOOGLE\u2019S COMPETING TOOL, ENSURING ACCESS TO THEIR SINGLE, PREFERRED SYSTEM ACROSS VARIOUS STREAMING WEBSITES AND APPS.  FREEWHEEL IS THE GO-TO VIDEO AD SERVER BECAUSE OF ITS EXPERIENCE, SAID A FREEWHEEL CLIENT, SPEAKING ON THE CONDITION OF ANONYMITY.  BUT LAST YEAR, GOOGLE CLOSED FREEWHEEL\u2019S PIPE INTO YOUTUBE IN EUROPE, CITING THE EU\u2019S GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION THAT IMPOSED NEW REQUIREMENTS ON COMPANIES SEEKING TO SHARE CONSUMER DATA.  IN THE UNITED STATES, GOOGLE HAS ALLOWED FREEWHEEL\u2019S CONTINUED USE ON THE CONDITION THAT STARTING WITH TESTS THIS MONTH, THE TENS OF MEDIA COMPANIES RELIANT ON IT WILL BE CUT OFF FROM ACCESSING SOME USER DATA FOR PRIVACY REASONS, ONE OF THE SOURCES SAID. THE DATA REDUCTION COULD MAKE FREEWHEEL\u2019S SYSTEM LESS ATTRACTIVE TO MEDIA COMPANIES AND THEIR ADVERTISERS, POTENTIALLY PROMPTING A SHIFT TO GOOGLE, THE SOURCE SAID.  GOOGLE SAID A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF YOUTUBE REVENUE IS AFFECTED AND THAT IT HAS BEEN WORKING WITH FREEWHEEL TO RESTORE ACCESS IN EUROPE AND PRESERVE IT IN THE UNITED STATES.  A FREEWHEEL REPRESENTATIVE BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE AT A PRIVATE HEARING IN SEPTEMBER OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE\u2019S TECH TASK FORCE, LED BY REPUBLICAN SENATOR MARSHA BLACKBURN, THE SOURCES BRIEFED ON THE DISCUSSION SAID.  BLACKBURN, WHO IS HOLDING HEARINGS TO INFORM POTENTIAL PRIVACY LAWS, SAID ON C-SPAN LAST WEEK THAT A CONGRESSIONAL PRIVACY BILL BEING WEIGHED MUST PRESERVE COMPETITION BETTER THAN EU REGULATIONS HAVE. HER SPOKESWOMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT ON FREEWHEEL\u2019S TASK FORCE COMMENTS.  INTERNET TRACKING  THE CONFLICT IS PLAYING OUT ON ANOTHER FRONT. GOOGLE SAID LAST MONTH IT IS EXPERIMENTING WITH ENCRYPTING THE INTERNET TRAFFIC OF CHROME USERS, AND ANDROID HAS SIMILAR CAPABILITY IN ITS NEWEST VERSION.  THE MOVE, TECHNICALLY KNOWN AS DNS-OVER-HTTPS, INCREASES USERS\u2019 PRIVACY AND SECURITY BY LIMITING SOME COMPANIES, INCLUDING INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, FROM TRACKING USERS\u2019 BROWSING.

FILE PHOTO: PHARMACEUTICAL TABLETS AND CAPSULES ARE ARRANGED IN THE SHAPE OF A U.S. DOLLAR SIGN ON A TABLE IN THIS PICTURE ILLUSTRATION TAKEN IN LJUBLJANA AUGUST 20, 2014. REUTERS/SRDJAN ZIVULOVIC  THE COMPANY HAS HELD BACK ON MARKETING THE PHARMACY BENEFIT PLAN WHILE IT TALKS TO THESE GROUPS, CVS SAID.  THE PLAN, LAUNCHED A YEAR AGO, IS BASED ON ANALYSES BY THE INSTITUTE FOR CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC REVIEW (ICER), A BOSTON-BASED GROUP THAT ASSESSES EFFECTIVENESS OF DRUGS TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE PRICES.  USING ICER\u2019S COST EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT, CVS DECIDES WHETHER TO INCLUDE SECOND OR THIRD MEDICINES ENTERING THE MARKET IF THERE ARE ALREADY SIMILAR ONES IN THE PLAN.  OPPOSITION TO THE CVS PLAN IS PART OF MUCH BROADER CONCERNS CITED BY DRUG COMPANIES AND ADVOCACY GROUPS, MANY OF WHICH RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. SOME SAY THAT ICER\u2019S ANALYSIS BASED ON ADDITIONAL YEARS OF \u201cQUALITY LIFE\u201d GAINED FROM A GIVEN TREATMENT IS ARBITRARY AND DISREGARDS THE COSTS OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND PATIENT NEEDS.  MORE THAN 50 GROUPS, INCLUDING DRUGMAKERS, PHRMA, THE INDUSTRY\u2019S MAIN LOBBY GROUP, AND OTHER ADVOCACY GROUPS, HAVE PROVIDED COMMENT DURING A PUBLIC INPUT PERIOD INCLUDED IN A REVIEW BY ICER OF ITS ASSESSMENT METHODS. MANY ASKED ICER TO ELIMINATE PRICE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM ITS EFFICACY ANALYSES.  ICER HAS DEFENDED ITS METHODS, WHICH ARE BASED ON A WIDELY-USED COST EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS.  THE SOFT ROLLOUT OF CVS\u2019 ICER-RELATED PRODUCT COMES AS EMPLOYER HEALTH PLAN SPONSORS - ITS BIGGEST CLIENTS - ARE SHOWING INCREASED CONCERN OVER THEIR COST FOR NEW HIGH-PRICED DRUGS, AND ARE CONSIDERING REFUSING TO PAY FOR THEM AT ALL, CVS CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER TROY BRENNAN SAID IN A RECENT INTERVIEW.  IF CORPORATE CUSTOMERS FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT THREAT, CVS SAID IT COULD CHANGE TACTICS WITH THE PLAN.  RISING DRUG PRICES, PARTICULARLY FOR EXPENSIVE SPECIALTY TREATMENTS FOR SEVERE OR DEADLY CONDITIONS, HAVE PUSHED ANNUAL U.S. HEALTHCARE SPENDING TO $3.65 TRILLION, AND MADE THEM UNAFFORDABLE FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS.  EARLIER THIS YEAR, NOVARTIS AG (NOVN.S) LAUNCHED ZOLGENSMA, A MORE THAN $2 MILLION GENE THERAPY FOR A RARE BUT DEADLY DISEASE CALLED SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY.  THE NEW CVS PROGRAM, CITED AS AN EXAMPLE OF ICER\u2019S GROWING INFLUENCE ON U.S. DRUG PRICING, WOULD NOT APPLY TO SUCH A BREAKTHROUGH TREATMENT. IT IS A TINY PLAN BY CVS STANDARDS AS THE COMPANY MANAGES PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS FOR MORE THAN 102 MILLION PEOPLE AND ALSO OWNS AETNA INSURANCE AND A NATIONAL PHARMACY CHAIN.  NOT WIDELY PROMOTED  THE PLAN\u2019S SCOPE IS LIMITED TO SO-CALLED ME TOO DRUGS, THOSE WHERE SIMILAR EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS ALREADY EXIST, AND AIMS TO PRESSURE DRUGMAKERS TO SET LOWER PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, TWO OF THREE VERY SIMILAR DRUGS FOR MIGRAINE APPROVED IN 2018 COULD HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED, BUT DRUGMAKERS SET PRICES ICER DEEMED COST EFFECTIVE.  CVS HAS LIMITED SALES AND MARKETING FOR THE PLAN WHILE IT TALKS TO PATIENT GROUPS WHO OPPOSE IT. ABOUT 240,000 CVS EMPLOYEES AND A FEW LARGE CLIENTS\u2019 EMPLOYEES ARE ENROLLED THUS FAR. THE COMPANY DECLINED TO COMMENT ON EXACT MEMBERSHIP.  \u201cWE ARE NOT WIDELY PROMOTING THIS PROGRAM,\u201d BRENNAN SAID, ADDING THAT CVS IS WORKING TO ADDRESS PATIENT GROUPS\u2019 CONCERNS.  MEANWHILE, BRENNAN SAID SOME EMPLOYERS ARE CONSIDERING REFUSING TO PAY FOR MILLION-DOLLAR TREATMENTS LIKE GENE THERAPY. THEY ARE SAYING, \u201cI\u2019M NOT GOING TO COVER THESE KINDS OF THERAPIES NO MATTER WHAT THEIR COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS IS IF THEY\u2019VE GOT A REALLY HIGH COST.\u201d  LARGE HEALTHCARE CONSULTANT AND BROKERAGE MERCER SAID IT HAS BEGUN TO FIELD SIMILAR CONCERNS.  \u201cWE HAVE CERTAINLY GOTTEN SOME PLAN SPONSORS SAYING \u2018WHAT IF WE DON\u2019T COVER SPECIALTY DRUGS?\u2019\u201d SAID DAVID DROSS, WHO RUNS MERCER\u2019S MANAGED PHARMACY PRACTICE. TWO YEARS AGO, IT NEVER RECEIVED ANY SUCH QUESTIONS, HE SAID.  STEVE WOJCIK, AN EXECUTIVE WITH THE NATIONAL BUSINESS GROUP ON HEALTH WHICH REPRESENTS LARGE EMPLOYERS, SAID HE DOES NOT BELIEVE MANY WILL TAKE THAT DRASTIC STEP.  STILL, ICER PRESIDENT STEVEN PEARSON SAID EMPLOYERS TELL HIM THEY WORRY ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO COVER EVERYTHING AND HAVE SUGGESTED THEY MIGHT DROP SOME HIGH-COST TREATMENTS. HE SAID EMPLOYERS CAN USE COST EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS TO HELP THEM MANAGE THEIR SPENDING.  FILE PHOTO: THE CVS LOGO IS SEEN AT ONE OF THEIR STORES IN MANHATTAN, NEW YORK, U.S., AUGUST 1, 2016. REUTERS/ANDREW KELLY  ICER HAS RESPONDED TO OUTSIDE CRITICISM BY MEETING WITH PATIENT ADVOCATES AND BY ADDING NEW MEASUREMENTS FOR A DRUG\u2019S EFFECTIVENESS, SUCH AS THE VALUE OF LIFE YEARS GAINED, WHICH DOES NOT FOCUS ON QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS, PEARSON SAID.  SINCE 2015, ICER HAS PUBLISHED UP TO A DOZEN REVIEWS EACH YEAR OF DRUGS AND CLASSES OF MEDICINES.  MOST U.S. PRIVATE INSURERS NOW USE ICER CLINICAL AND COST ANALYSES TO INFORM COVERAGE NEGOTIATIONS WITH DRUGMAKERS. ICER FUNDING PRIMARILY COMES FROM A NON-PROFIT FOUNDATION, BUT DRUG COMPANIES AND HEALTH INSURERS PROVIDE SOME FUNDS FOR ICER-RELATED ACTIVITIES.", "Ticker": "CVS", "Date": "2019-10-03T00:00:00", "key": "20191003CVS", "labelr0": -0.4552845528455303, "labelr1": 1.6661221822933732, "labelr2": -0.4016709511568123, "labelr3": -2.5971930956605886, "labelr4": 0.6955945677376525, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.0, "0_day_return": -0.4552845528455252, "1_day_return": 1.6661221822933836, "2_day_return": 1.2577589023195168, "3_day_return": -1.3721006207121689, "4_day_return": -0.6860503103560899, "label": 1, "return": 0.014216897600649132, "excess_return": 1.6519052846927345, "count_of_word": 832, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.49514878, "prof1": 0.5048513, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5250933028908517, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4749066971091484, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.49514878, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.5048513, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.33773512, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.6622648, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.48120362, "tr_prof1": 0.5187963, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.43486315, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.56513685, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.6335924, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.36640754, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.4508739000000001, "headline_prof21": 0.5491261, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.30150157, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.69849837, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.71282285, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.28717715, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.5607270999999999, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.43927288, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 1.6661221822933836, "returnpredvader": -1.6661221822933836, "returnpredsgd": -1.6661221822933836, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9922539554500475, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9996510978210632, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.001393580258936, "cumreturn1b": 2.4649303019860858, "cumreturn1d": 1.2692658930322516, "cumreturn1e": 1.4148449834275816, "cumreturndow": 1.1760855351902244, "cumreturnsp500": 1.13824412139389}, {"Unnamed: 0": 12609, "Unnamed: 0.1": 12609, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 12609, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 12609, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 12609, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 12609, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12609, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12609, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12609, "level_0": 12609, "index": 12609, "text": "(REUTERS) - AUSTRALIA\u2019S CONSUMER WATCHDOG ON FRIDAY URGED THE OWNERS OF 20,000 VEHICLES WITH DEFECTIVE TAKATA AIRBAGS CLASSIFIED AS PARTICULARLY UNSAFE TO STOP DRIVING IMMEDIATELY.

UNLIKE PLENTY OF THEIR P.R.-HUNGRY COUNTERPARTS IN SILICON VALLEY, MEXICAN STARTUP FOUNDERS OFTEN DECLINE MEDIA INTERVIEWS, AVOID PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS AND SUPPRESS DETAILS OF FINANCIAL SUCCESS.  ONE BIG REASON: THEY DO NOT WANT TO ATTRACT CRIMINALS.  \u201cYOU ARE GETTING YOURSELF IN A POSITION WHERE YOU COULD BE SUBJECT TO RANSOM,\u201d ENTREPRENEUR ULISES VAZQUEZ SAID OF THE DRUG-FUELED VIOLENCE AND KIDNAPPINGS THAT HAVE SCARRED SOCIETY.  \u201cYOU WANT TO HAVE A LOW PROFILE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE WITH YOUR FREEDOM,\u201d HE ADDED. VAZQUEZ TWICE KEPT QUIET ON MAJOR STARTUP MILESTONES: WHEN HE SOLD A STAKE IN HIS ADVERTISING AGENCY ERGOS IN 2010, AND WHEN THE ACQUIRING FIRM, MATOMY , WENT PUBLIC IN 2014.  THOUGH UNDERSTANDABLE, THE LOW-PROFILE APPROACH IS HOLDING BACK MEXICO\u2019S TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY, INVESTORS AND EXPERTS SAY, MAKING IT HARDER TO ATTRACT TALENT AND MONEY, ESPECIALLY FROM ABROAD.  MEXICO\u2019S TECH SECTOR LAST YEAR DREW ONLY $175 MILLION IN VENTURE CAPITAL, ACCORDING TO THE ASSOCIATION FOR PRIVATE CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN LATIN AMERICA. THAT WAS DWARFED BY BRAZIL, THE REGION\u2019S POWERHOUSE, WHICH RECEIVED $1.3 BILLION, BUT ALSO TRAILED COLOMBIA, WHICH DREW $334 MILLION IN VENTURE CAPITAL THOUGH ITS ECONOMY IS WORTH ABOUT A QUARTER OF MEXICO\u2019S.  REUTERS SPOKE WITH TWO DOZEN INVESTORS AND STARTUP FOUNDERS WHO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SECURITY CONCERNS WERE WIDESPREAD IN THE TECH COMMUNITY AND HAD EVEN PUSHED SOME ENTREPRENEURS ABROAD.  ILLUSTRATING THE CONCERN, MOST DECLINED TO SPEAK ON THE RECORD.  WITHOUT PUBLICITY, ENTREPRENEURS STRUGGLE TO RECRUIT THE BEST, BRING IN MONEY AND INSPIRE THE NEXT GENERATION, SAID DANIEL GREEN, A PARTNER AT SILICON VALLEY LAW FIRM GUNDERSON DETTMER WHO ADVISES STARTUPS ACROSS LATIN AMERICA.  \u201cIT CERTAINLY STUNTS THE GROWTH,\u201d HE SAID.  \u201cLIVING AT RISK\u201d  TO BE SURE, VIOLENCE IS RAMPANT ELSEWHERE IN LATIN AMERICA, FROM DRUG-TORN COLOMBIA TO CRIME-RIDDEN BRAZIL.  BUT THE ISSUE IS ESPECIALLY ACUTE IN MEXICO DUE TO AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE FROM OVER A DECADE AGO WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SENT ARMED FORCES INTO THE STREETS TO CRACK DOWN ON THE CARTELS. AROUND THE SAME TIME, DRUG GANGS BEGAN BRANCHING INTO EXTORTION.  A STRING OF HIGH-PROFILE KIDNAPPINGS AND MURDERS, INCLUDING THE DEATH OF AN EXECUTIVE AT BROADCASTER TELEVISA KILLED ON HIS BIKE DURING A SHOOTOUT IN 2017, RATTLED THE ELITE.  THAT HAS GENERATED BUSINESS FOR EXECUTIVE PROTECTION FIRMS, WHO PROVIDE BULLET-PROOF VEHICLES, GPS TRACKERS, ARMED BODYGUARDS AND REAL-TIME MONITORING.  FOR STARTUPS, THE FEARS MAY BE MORE PERCEPTION THAN REALITY: THERE ARE NO KNOWN CASES OF TECH ENTREPRENEURS BEING ATTACKED AFTER SHARING THEIR COMPANY\u2019S SUCCESS.  AND SOME DO STILL ANNOUNCE THEIR DEALS.  BISMARCK LEPE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF SOFTWARE COMPANY WIZELINE, BELIEVES HIS PEERS ARE BEING OVER-CAUTIOUS, DESPITE THE HORRORS MEXICO HAS SUFFERED.  \u201cCOMMUNICATING MORE ABOUT YOUR SUCCESS HELPS THE COMMUNITY, HELPS THE COMPANY, HELPS THE INVESTORS,\u201d SAID LEPE, WHO DIVIDES HIS TIME BETWEEN SILICON VALLEY AND MEXICO.  \u201cAS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE DRUG TRADE, NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU.\u201d  MEXICAN ENTREPRENEUR DOMINGO GUERRA, WHO FOUNDED CYBERSECURITY STARTUP APPTHORITY IN CALIFORNIA, SAID HE IS NOT GENERALLY WORRIED ABOUT SAFETY WHEN HE RETURNS HOME. BUT HE DID FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AFTER ANNOUNCING A FUNDING ROUND.  \u201cFOLKS WERE ASKING HOW I WAS GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY, WHAT I WAS GOING TO BUY FIRST,\u201d SAID GUERRA, NOW A SENIOR DIRECTOR AT CYBERSECURITY GIANT SYMANTEC AFTER THE ACQUISITION OF HIS COMPANY IN 2018. \u201cI SPENT A LOT OF TIME EXPLAINING THAT REALLY NONE OF THAT MONEY WAS FOR THE FOUNDERS.\u201d  ONE STARTUP FOUNDER, ASSIGNED A U.S. ARMY VETERAN TRAINED IN ANTI-KIDNAPPING MANEUVERS BY A FIRM ACQUIRING HIS COMPANY, BECAME FED UP OF HAVING TO TAKE A DIFFERENT ROUTE HOME EVERY DAY AND EVENTUALLY RELOCATED WITH HIS FAMILY TO THE UNITED STATES.  ANOTHER WHO FOUNDED HIS STARTUP IN THE SAN FRANCISCO AREA SAID AMERICAN COLLEAGUES WERE FRUSTRATED BY HIS QUIET APPROACH DUE TO FEARS FOR HIS RELATIVES BACK IN MEXICO.  \u201cTHERE\u2019S AN UNOFFICIAL TAX FOR OPERATING AND LIVING IN MEXICO - AND THAT TAX IS LIVING AT RISK,\u201d HE SAID.  FROM SCOOTER TO SUV  SOME ENTREPRENEURS HAVE SIMPLY FADED FROM PUBLIC VIEW.  ADOLFO BABATZ, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF MEXICAN PAYMENTS COMPANY CLIP, WAS ONCE A STAPLE OF THE LOCAL BUSINESS PRESS. IN 2018, HE GAVE AT LEAST FIVE PUBLISHED INTERVIEWS AND GRACED THE COVER OF BUSINESS MAGAZINE EXPANSION BESIDE THE HEADLINE: \u201cTHINK BIG.\u201d  HE TOOK A DIFFERENT TACK THIS YEAR AFTER SOFTBANK PUMPED ABOUT $20 MILLION INTO HIS COMPANY, MAKING HIM AMONG THE FIRST MEXICAN ENTREPRENEURS TO WIN THE JAPANESE CONGLOMERATE\u2019S STAMP OF APPROVAL. BABATZ DID NOT ANNOUNCE THE DEAL AND APPEARS TO HAVE GIVEN FEW INTERVIEWS SO FAR IN 2019.  SOFTBANK, WHICH PLANS TO POUR $5 BILLION INTO LATIN AMERICA, DECLINED TO COMMENT.  SOME ENTREPRENEURS ADVOCATE WORKAROUNDS.  GABRIEL LEON, WHO RECENTLY LAUNCHED FINTECH COMPANY OYSTER FINANCIAL IN MEXICO, PLANS TO DISCLOSE COMPANY FUNDING ROUNDS ON AN ONLINE DATABASE, RATHER THAN VIA THE MEDIA.  \u201cWE NEVER TALK ABOUT MONEY,\u201d HE SAID. \u201cWE TALK ABOUT THE PRODUCT WE\u2019RE BUILDING, THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE MARKET, OUR COMPETITORS. THAT\u2019S HOW YOU GET ATTENTION FROM INVESTORS.\u201d  SOME ENTREPRENEURS SAY THE POLITICAL CLIMATE, WITH LEFTIST PRESIDENT ANDRES MANUEL LOPEZ OBRADOR FREQUENTLY CRUSADING AGAINST THE ELITES, HAS MADE IT AN ADDITIONALLY AWKWARD TIME TO TOUT MULTI-MILLION DEALS IN A CULTURE THAT FROWNS ON BRAGGING.  MEXICO\u2019S ECONOMY MINISTRY DID NOT RESPOND TO REUTERS REQUESTS TO DISCUSS THE STARTUP SECTOR\u2019S SECURITY CONCERNS.  SERGIO ROMO, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF MEXICAN SCOOTER STARTUP GRIN, FOLLOWED A SIMILAR TRAJECTORY TO BABATZ AFTER A $45.7 MILLION FUNDING ROUND LAST YEAR.  EARLIER THIS YEAR, ROMO, WHO WAS KNOWN FOR TOOLING AROUND THE CAPITAL IN HIS COMPANY\u2019S NEON GREEN SCOOTERS, LEFT A MEETING WITH MEXICO CITY REGULATORS IN A LARGE SUV WITH TINTED WINDOWS, ACCORDING TO SOMEONE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE MEETING.  ROMO TOLD REUTERS THAT WAS UNUSUAL AND HE STILL USES SCOOTERS, BUT ACKNOWLEDGED KEEPING A LOW PROFILE WAS ADVISABLE.  \u201cPEOPLE OUTSIDE THE STARTUP WORLD TEND TO THINK THAT FOUNDERS WHO RAISE A LOT OF MONEY BECOME RICH THEMSELVES, BUT SOMETIMES THAT\u2019S NOT THE CASE,\u201d HE SAID.  \u201cWE ARE JUST FOUNDERS TRYING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.\u201d  ONCE ACTIVE ON TWITTER, HIS POSTS HAVE BEEN DELETED.", "Ticker": "NSIT", "Date": "2019-10-16T00:00:00", "key": "20191016NSIT", "labelr0": 1.5881418740074087, "labelr1": 0.7121764808059694, "labelr2": 0.7416350465677816, "labelr3": 0.2910460537579211, "labelr4": -0.768180266302485, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.314, "compound": -0.4939, "0_day_return": 1.5881418740073985, "1_day_return": 1.5881418740073985, "2_day_return": 1.459093277748824, "3_day_return": 1.754385964912264, "4_day_return": 0.9727288518325494, "label": 1, "return": 0.0027628316524479237, "excess_return": 1.5853790423549503, "count_of_word": 1065, "pred": -1, "prof-1": 0.42982563, "prof1": 0.57017446, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5998460468162881, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4001539531837121, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.42982563, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.57017446, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.39928806, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.60071194, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5124727, "tr_prof1": 0.48752725, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.433254, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.56674606, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5745474, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.42545256, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.5370047, "headline_prof21": 0.4629953, "textplusheadline_pred": -1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.54584885, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.4541512, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.7651541999999999, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.23484579, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.8040719, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.19592808, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -1.5881418740073985, "returnpredvader": -1.5881418740073985, "returnpredsgd": -1.5881418740073985, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9999631231522269, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9992690881236788, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9957475576736204, "cumreturn1b": 2.569461590677221, "cumreturn1d": 1.2525479404174291, "cumreturn1e": 1.3916612460038418, "cumreturndow": 1.1943880815618717, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1576117005615842}, {"Unnamed: 0": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13205, "level_0": 13205, "index": 13205, "text": "SAO PAULO, OCT 16 (REUTERS) - BRAZILIAN STATE-RUN POWER FIRM CENTRAIS ELETRICAS BRASILEIRAS SA ESTIMATED THAT IT COULD RAISE UP TO 5.1 BILLION REAIS ($1.23 BILLION) VIA THE POTENTIAL ISSUE OF 9.99 BILLION REAIS WORTH OF SHARES, ACCORDING TO A COMPANY PRESENTATION RELEASED WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

BUT ANALYSTS CONTEND THAT UNCERTAINTIES AROUND LABOR AND SUPPLIERS MAKE IT A CHALLENGE TO START MASS PRODUCTION.  \u201cTHERE IS A LOT IN THE EQUATION THAT IS NOT IN THEIR CONTROL,\u201d SAID TU LE, ANALYST AT CHINA-BASED RESEARCH FIRM SINO AUTO INSIGHTS.  \u201cTHERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT JUST NEED TIME IN ORDER TO COMPLETE, LIKE QUALIFYING NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, A NEW BATTERY SUPPLIER, GETTING THE TOOLING SHIPPED AND SET UP, AS WELL AS SETTING UP ALL THE SUPPLIERS. ANY PARTS THAT HAVE TO BE IMPORTED NEED TO GO THROUGH CUSTOMS, WHICH ALSO COULD MEAN DELAYS,\u201d HE SAID.  TESLA IS ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING A KEY CERTIFICATION NEEDED TO SELL CHINA-MADE CARS IN THE COUNTRY, IT TOLD LOCAL MEDIA, THOUGH IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL GRANT IT SALES CLEARANCE.  TESLA DID NOT REPLY TO AN EMAIL SEEKING COMMENT.  IT SAID IN APRIL IT AIMS TO PRODUCE AT LEAST 1,000 MODEL 3 CARS A WEEK AT THE NEW FACTORY BY THE END OF THIS YEAR.  ANALYSTS, THOUGH, ARE DOUBTFUL THAT TESLA WILL HIT THIS TARGET, GIVEN ITS PATCHY PRODUCTION RECORD.  DELAYS AND QUALITY ISSUES HAVE MARRED THE LAUNCHES OF TESLA'S MODEL S AND MODEL X VEHICLES IN THE PAST, AND TESLA STRUGGLED TO START HERE MAKING THE MODEL 3 AT ITS CALIFORNIA FACTORY IN 2017.  THE COMPANY TOOK SIX MONTHS LONGER THAN ORIGINALLY FORECAST TO HIT A TARGET OF 5,000 MODEL 3 CARS PER WEEK, ACHIEVING THAT PACE ABOUT A YEAR AFTER LAUNCHING PRODUCTION.  STILL, TESLA IS TAKING STEPS TO ENSURE A SMOOTH LAUNCH OF PRODUCTION, INCLUDING TRYING TO DIVERSIFY ITS BATTERY SUPPLIER BASE, SOURCES HAVE SAID.  IT RECENTLY BOUGHT MAXWELL TECHNOLOGIES, WHOSE TECHNOLOGY COULD HELP THE CAR MAKER PRODUCE BATTERIES THAT LAST LONGER.  AT HIRING EVENTS IN SHANGHAI IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER, ATTENDED BY REUTERS JOURNALISTS, TESLA INTERVIEWED HUNDREDS OF CANDIDATES FROM MAINSTREAM CAR MAKERS IN CHINA.  IT ALSO ADVERTISED ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR BATTERY-RELATED PRODUCTION AND SOFTWARE SYSTEM ENGINEERS IN SHANGHAI, AND DELIVERY MANAGERS IN BIG CHINESE CITIES.  FURTHER LOSSES?  CHINA, FOR ITS PART, IS HELPING SPEED UP THINGS AT THE SHANGHAI FACTORY - THE COUNTRY\u2019S FIRST FULLY FOREIGN-OWNED CAR PLANT, A REFLECTION OF BEIJING\u2019S BROADER SHIFT TO OPEN UP ITS AUTO MARKET.  STATE-OWNED CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES HAVE ARRANGED EXTRA WORKFORCE AND BANKS ARE OFFERING CHEAP LOANS, WHILE THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WILL EXEMPT TESLA CARS FROM ITS PURCHASE TAX, A CONCESSION MADE AMIDST TRADE TENSIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES.  THE MODEL 3 HAS FARED WELL IN CHINA, THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST CAR MARKET.  TESLA SALES IN CHINA LIKELY SURGED MORE THAN THREE FOLD TO 10,542 CARS IN THE QUARTER ENDED SEPT. 30, ACCORDING TO RESEARCH FIRM LMC AUTOMOTIVE.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO DELIVER 360,000 TO 400,000 CARS THIS YEAR GLOBALLY.  SLIDESHOW (4 IMAGES)  ANALYSTS EXPECT TESLA\u2019S THIRD-QUARTER REVENUE TO DECLINE 7% FROM THE YEAR-AGO QUARTER, ACCORDING TO REFINITIV DATA. THEY PREDICT A LOSS OF 42 CENTS PER SHARE, EXCLUDING ONE-TIME ITEMS, IN CONTRAST TO MUSK\u2019S PROMISES THAT THE COMPANY WOULD BREAK EVEN IN THE QUARTER.  GROSS MARGINS LIKELY SHRANK TO 15.6% FROM 22.3%.  \u201cTHE BIGGEST OVERHANG AROUND THE STORY IS THE ABILITY TO HIT PROFITABILITY AND TO ACHIEVE ITS AMBITIOUS UNIT GUIDANCE FOR 2019,\u201d WEDBUSH ANALYST DAN IVES SAID IN A PRE-EARNINGS RESEARCH NOTE.", "Ticker": "TSLA", "Date": "2019-10-23T00:00:00", "key": "20191023TSLA", "labelr0": -0.3521402300649525, "labelr1": 17.669231977383387, "labelr2": 9.493459690336355, "labelr3": -0.12799804955353547, "labelr4": -3.5061487290592144, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.0, "0_day_return": -0.3521402300649568, "1_day_return": 17.669231977383394, "2_day_return": 28.84011308308465, "3_day_return": 28.675200251295728, "4_day_return": 24.16365635307054, "label": 1, "return": 0.0019204461816167387, "excess_return": 17.667311531201772, "count_of_word": 702, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5477603, "prof1": 0.45223975, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5579773418349987, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4420226581650013, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5477603, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.45223975, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.4519833, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.54801667, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5067604, "tr_prof1": 0.49323958, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.6485155, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.35148448, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5673609000000001, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.43263906, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.5705985, "headline_prof21": 0.42940152, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.44228733, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5577127, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.53297585, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.4670242, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.6500613000000001, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.3499387, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -17.669231977383394, "returnpredvader": -17.669231977383394, "returnpredsgd": -17.669231977383394, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0092915548681662, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9964599330020255, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0032320654413662, "cumreturn1b": 2.672886497839722, "cumreturn1d": 1.2603343928024717, "cumreturn1e": 1.4034561914507286, "cumreturndow": 1.199304392465497, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1481732830780231}, {"Unnamed: 0": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13636, "level_0": 13636, "index": 13636, "text": "OCT 24 (REUTERS) -

A POTENTIAL BID FOR DEVICE-MAKER FITBIT COULD BRING NEW YOUTHFUL ENERGY FOR THE $880 BILLION FIRM, OR JUST A SLIGHTLY EXPANDED WAISTLINE.  THE OWNER OF GOOGLE SHOWED ON MONDAY THAT ITS CORE BUSINESS OF SELLING ONLINE ADS STILL PUMPS OUT PROFIT. ALPHABET\u2019S REVENUE HIT $40.5 BILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE YEAR, AN INCREASE OF 20% FROM LAST YEAR. BUT THAT\u2019S LESS RAPID THAN ITS RATE A YEAR AGO.

THE OFFER FOR FITBIT THAT REUTERS REPORTED, CITING SOURCES, HAS SOME LOGIC. ALPHABET CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE LARRY PAGE HAS MADE PUSHES IN MOBILE DEVICES, SMART CONTACTS AND DELIVERING BROADBAND VIA BALLOON AMONG OTHERS. ACQUISITIONS PLAYED A PART IN SEVERAL OF THESE EFFORTS. WHILE SOME PROVED WILDLY SUCCESSFUL \u2013 ITS MOBILE AD BUSINESS SUCCESS CAN BE PINNED IN LARGE PART TO BUYING THE MAKER OF THE ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM \u2013 OTHERS, SUCH AS FIBER BROADBAND, HAVE BEEN DUDS.  HEALTHCARE IS AN AREA WHERE GOOGLE HAS HAD LITTLE VISIBLE SUCCESS. PERHAPS FITBIT\u2019S EXPERIENCE IN DESIGNING WEARABLES WILL HELP ALPHABET MAKE USEFUL DEVICES FOR HEART-RATE MONITORING OR GLUCOSE MONITORS. ALPHABET COULD BRING HEFT THAT FITBIT ON ITS OWN LACKS. THE STOCK IS DOWN 70% FROM ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING IN 2015, PARTLY DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF APPLE\u2019S WATCH.  GROWING SIDEWAYS BRINGS PITFALLS. AS WELL AS BEING A DISTRACTION, AN ALPHABET BID FOR FITBIT COULD DRAW POLITICAL SCRUTINY. DATA COLLECTED BY HEALTH TRACKERS IS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE IN THE EYES OF REGULATORS AND ANTITRUST WATCHDOGS HAVE SAID SUCH INFORMATION WOULD BECOME A MORE IMPORTANT PART OF MERGER REVIEWS. FITBIT IS ALSO A CONSUMER BRAND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE LIKELY TO UNDERSTAND, OR EVEN USE.

THE DISCOUNT BROKERAGE BUSINESS MODEL IS FACING INCREASING PRESSURE, AS FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY DISRUPTORS LIKE ROBINHOOD PUSHED LEGACY FIRMS TO CUT COMMISSIONS TO ZERO, AND THE INCREASED USE OF TECHNOLOGY HAS REQUIRED HUGE SPENDING ON PLATFORMS. THE SOLUTION TO MANAGING COSTS IS GETTING BIGGER AND ACQUIRING MORE CLIENTS, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT SCHWAB COULD ACHIEVE BY ACQUIRING ITS SMALLER RIVAL.  QUESTION: WILL THIS AFFECT FEES FOR RETAIL INVESTORS?  CUSTOMERS OF BOTH FIRMS ALREADY GET FREE ONLINE TRADES OF STOCKS, ETFS AND OPTIONS. SCHWAB WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO CUT ITS FEES TO ZERO IN EARLY OCTOBER, FORCING TD AMERITRADE AND OTHERS TO FOLLOW WITH SIMILAR MOVES. ANALYSTS SAID IT IS UNLIKELY THE COMBINED FIRM WOULD RAISE FEES AFTER A MERGER.  QUESTION: HOW ELSE CAN THIS AFFECT RETAIL INVESTORS?  TD AMERITRADE CLIENTS COULD GAIN ACCESS TO SCHWAB\u2019S WEALTH MANAGEMENT, ASSET MANAGEMENT, BANKING AND CUSTODY SERVICES THROUGH THE DEAL, ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS. CUSTOMERS OF SCHWAB COULD ALSO SEE IMPROVEMENTS IN TRADING TECHNOLOGY AND EDUCATIONAL TOOLS FOR INVESTING \u2014 TWO THINGS TD AMERITRADE HAS INVESTED IN. ON THE DOWNSIDE, THE COMBINED BROKERAGE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE MARKET POWER, THE IMPACT OF WHICH REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

JOHNSON/FILE PHOTO  BOEING CO\u2019S (BA.N) CST-100 STARLINER ASTRONAUT CAPSULE HAD A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH FOR ITS FIRST UNMANNED TEST MISSION, BUT WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS AN AUTOMATED TIMER ERROR PREVENTED THE SPACECRAFT FROM ATTAINING THE CORRECT ORBIT FOR IT TO RENDEZVOUS AND DOCK WITH THE SPACE STATION.  THE U.S. SPACE AGENCY IS FORMING AN INVESTIGATIVE TEAM TO DETERMINE WHAT CAUSED THE TIMER GLITCH AND \u201cANY OTHER SOFTWARE ISSUES,\u201d NASA SAID. THE TEAM WILL \u201cPROVIDE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS\u201d NEEDED BEFORE STARLINER CAN FLY A CREW OF ASTRONAUTS FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT ADDED, SAYING THE PROBE WILL TAKE ABOUT TWO MONTHS.  NASA SAID IT WAS WEIGHING WHETHER TO MAKE BOEING REPEAT THE TEST, WHICH WOULD LIKELY COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND ADD FURTHER DELAY, TO SHOW IT CAN DOCK AT THE STATION SUCCESSFULLY. DOCKING WAS A KEY REQUIREMENT FOR THE TEST UNDER BOEING\u2019S CONTRACT.  \u201cALTHOUGH DATA FROM THE UNCREWED TEST IS IMPORTANT FOR CERTIFICATION, IT MAY NOT BE THE ONLY WAY THAT BOEING IS ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE ITS SYSTEM\u2019S FULL CAPABILITIES,\u201d THE AGENCY SAID.  IT ADDED THAT IT WOULD TAKE NASA \u201cSEVERAL WEEKS\u201d TO DECIDE WHETHER BOEING WILL NEED TO RE-DO ITS TEST OR CARRY ON TO THE FINAL TEST FLIGHT OF LOFTING HUMANS TO THE SPACE STATION, SET FOR LATER THIS YEAR.  THE SPACECRAFT, A CONE-SHAPED POD WITH SEATS FOR SEVEN ASTRONAUTS, LANDED SUCCESSFULLY IN WHITE SANDS, NEW MEXICO SIX DAYS EARLIER THAN PLANNED, AFTER ITS DECEMBER LAUNCH.  THE LANDING, WHICH TESTED THE CAPSULE\u2019S DIFFICULT RE-ENTRY INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND PARACHUTE DEPLOYMENT, YIELDED THE MISSION\u2019S MOST VALUABLE TEST DATA, NASA ADMINISTRATOR JIM BRIDENSTINE SAID.  NASA AWARDED $4.2 BILLION TO BOEING AND $2.5 BILLION TO ELON MUSK\u2019S RIVAL SPACEX IN 2014 TO DEVELOP SEPARATE CAPSULE SYSTEMS CAPABLE OF FERRYING ASTRONAUTS TO THE SPACE STATION FROM U.S. SOIL FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE NASA\u2019S SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM ENDED IN 2011.

GERMAN AUTOMAKERS VOLKSWAGEN AG (VOWG_P.DE), DAIMLER AG (DAIGN.DE) AND BMW AG ALL HAVE PROMISED TO LAUNCH FULLY ELECTRIC PREMIUM MODELS. GM\u2019S CADILLAC LUXURY BRAND IS GEARING UP TO LAUNCH A SERIES OF ELECTRIC SUVS AND CARS, WHILE FORD\u2019S MUSTANG MACH-E ELECTRIC SUV, UNVEILED IN NOVEMBER, WILL LAUNCH LATER THIS YEAR AND COULD COMPETE WITH TESLA\u2019S MODEL X OR SOON-TO-LAUNCH MODEL Y SUVS. FORD, GM AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS HAVE ELECTRIC PICKUPS IN THE WORKS TO TAKE ON MUSK\u2019S FUTURISTIC CYBERTRUCK.

LME VOLUMES BY CONTRACT: TMSNRT.RS/2UTKQU5    SHFE VOLUMES BY CONTRACT: TMSNRT.RS/2QVY54Q  BY ANDY HOME  LONDON, JAN 10 (REUTERS) - BASE METALS TRADING VOLUMES SHRANK ON ALL THREE MAJOR GLOBAL EXCHANGES LAST YEAR AS TRADE WAR UNCERTAINTY AND RANGE-BOUND MARKETS DAMPENED SPECULATIVE ACTIVITY.  \u2018DOCTOR COPPER\u2019 HAS LONG BEEN A FAVOURITE METALLIC PLAY AMONG PUNTERS AND SLIDING VOLUMES WERE SYMPTOMATIC OF A SECTOR THAT WAS LARGELY OUT OF FAVOUR WITH THE MONEY MEN.  THE LONDON METAL EXCHANGE\u2019S (LME) COPPER CONTRACT SAW ACTIVITY FALL BY 8% LAST YEAR. THE DECLINES WERE MORE PRONOUNCED ON BOTH THE CME AND SHANGHAI FUTURES EXCHANGES (SHFE) CONTRACTS WITH VOLUMES SLUMPING BY 25% AND 29% RESPECTIVELY.  ONLY NICKEL BUCKED THE BROADER TREND THANKS TO HEIGHTENED PRICE VOLATILITY AND THE METAL\u2019S ELECTRIC VEHICLE CREDENTIALS. TRADING VOLUMES ROSE BY 3% IN LONDON AND BY 40% IN SHANGHAI, WHERE NICKEL HAS ALSO ASSUMED THE ROLE OF JUNIOR PARTNER IN A PROXY TRADE WITH THE MUCH LARGER IRON ORE MARKET.  EXCHANGES CAN\u2019T DO MUCH ABOUT MANUFACTURING SLOWDOWN OR THE RESULTING RANGE-BOUND PRICING BUT THEY ARE EXPANDING THEIR PRODUCT RANGE AND OPENING UP ENTIRELY NEW MARKETS.  BASE METALS DOWNTURN  IT WAS A YEAR TO FORGET FOR MANY OF THE BASE METALS WITH COPPER, ALUMINIUM, ZINC AND LEAD CLOSING OUT 2019 LITTLE CHANGED FROM YEAR-START LEVELS.  TOTAL VOLUMES ON THE LONDON MARKET, WHICH STILL DOMINATES PHYSICAL PRICING, FELL BY 4.6% LAST YEAR AFTER A SIMILAR-SIZED RISE IN 2018.  IN TRUTH THE LME FARED SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN SUGGESTED BY THE HEADLINE FIGURE, WHICH INCLUDES SO-CALLED \u201cUNA\u201d TRADES INTRODUCED TO COMPLY WITH EUROPEAN MIFIDII REGULATIONS. STRIP THOSE OUT AND THE YEAR-ON-YEAR DECLINE WAS ONLY 1.9%.  EVEN SO, ACTIVITY ON ALL THE LME\u2019S CORE CONTRACTS FELL LAST YEAR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NICKEL, THE TOP PRICE PERFORMER AMONG THE BASE METALS IN 2019, AND TIN, THE WEAKEST PRICE PERFORMER. THE SAME TWO METALS WERE THE ONLY TWO TO REGISTER HIGHER VOLUMES IN SHANGHAI.  TIN REMAINS A TINY FUTURES MARKET BY COMPARISON WITH NICKEL BUT EVEN IT DWARFS THE LME\u2019S ALUMINIUM ALLOY CONTRACT, WHICH WITH VOLUME GROWTH OF 7% WAS THE UNLIKELY STAR PERFORMER LAST YEAR.  THAT OUTPERFORMANCE, HOWEVER, SHOULD BE SEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF FALLING ACTIVITY IN EACH OF THE PREVIOUS FOUR YEARS.  NEW PRODUCTS  THE LME LAUNCHED TWO NEW ALUMINIUM PREMIUM CONTRACTS IN MARCH LAST YEAR BUT WITH ONLY LIMITED SUCCESS. THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTRACT TRADED JUST 939 LOTS WHILE THE EUROPEAN PRODUCT FAILED TO TRADE AT ALL.  CME, WHICH LAUNCHED THE FIRST OF ITS FOUR ALUMINIUM PREMIUM CONTRACTS AS FAR BACK AS 2013, APPEARS TO HAVE CAPTURED THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE MARKET WITH TOTAL VOLUMES LAST YEAR OF 152,353 CONTRACTS.  ITS UNDERLYING ALUMINIUM CONTRACT LOOKED IN DANGER OF DISAPPEARING ALTOGETHER WITH NO TRADES AT ALL IN 2018 BUT THE CONTRACT SPRANG INTO LIFE IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2019 AFTER CME EXTENDED PHYSICAL DELIVERY TO ASIAN LOCATIONS SUCH AS SINGAPORE AND THE MALAYSIAN PORTS OF JOHOR AND PORT KLANG. THEY CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR 9,291 TONNES OF CME\u2019S TOTAL 17,145 TONNES OF REGISTERED ALUMINIUM STOCKS.  CME ZINC STOCKS HAVE SHRUNK TO JUST 6 TONNES AND THE CONTRACT, WHICH DIDN\u2019T TRADE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, LOOKS PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO FOLLOWING THE CME LEAD CONTRACT INTO OBLIVION.  VOLUMES IN THE CME\u2019S COPPER OPTIONS CONTRACT DOUBLED YEAR-ON-YEAR AND THE EXCHANGE\u2019S WEEKLY OPTIONS CONTRACTS, LAUNCHED IN 2018, STEADILY GAINED TRACTION OVER THE COURSE OF 2019.  AS DID THE SHFE COPPER OPTIONS CONTRACT, ALSO LAUNCHED IN 2018. ALMOST 8.4 MILLION LOTS TRADED IN 2019 WITH OPEN INTEREST IN DECEMBER STANDING AT 64,526 LOTS, UP 16% ON DECEMBER 2018.  MORE NEW BASE METAL PRODUCTS WERE LAUNCHED LAST YEAR BY HONG KONG EXCHANGES AND CLEARING (HKEX), THE OWNER OF THE LME.  A SUITE OF DOLLAR-DENOMINATED \u201cMINI\u201d CONTRACTS APPEAR TO BE SUCCEEDING WHERE THE YUAN-DENOMINATED OFFERING HAS LARGELY FAILED. TOTAL VOLUME WAS 29,334 CONTRACTS SINCE LAUNCH IN AUGUST, COMPARED WITH JUST 237 OVER THE WHOLE YEAR FOR THE CHINESE CURRENCY PRODUCTS.  THE NEW STEEL FRONTIER  ALL THREE EXCHANGES ARE ALSO MAKING STEADY INROADS INTO THE FERROUS SECTOR, WHICH HAS HISTORICALLY PROVED STUBBORNLY RESISTANT TO FUTURES TRADING.  THE LME\u2019S SCRAP AND REBAR CONTRACTS HAVE TRADED SINCE THE START OF 2018 AND ARE SEEING RESPECTABLE ACTIVITY. TWO NEW CONTRACTS, COVERING HOT ROLLED COIL (HRC) IN CHINA AND NORTH AMERICA, HAVE SEEN VOLUMES BUILD SINCE TRADING STARTED IN MARCH LAST YEAR. THE FORMER SET A NEW MONTHLY VOLUME RECORD OF 16,297 LOTS IN DECEMBER, BRINGING THE 2019 TOTAL TO 45,884 LOTS.  THE EXCHANGE HAS DROPPED PLENTY OF HINTS IT WILL CONSIDER BUILDING OUT ITS FERROUS PORTFOLIO FURTHER, GIVEN THE LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION IN THE CURRENT OFFERINGS.  IT\u2019S NOTICEABLE THAT THE CME\u2019S HRC CONTRACT HAS SEEN INCREASED ACTION SINCE THE LME RE-ENTERED THE STEEL SECTOR AFTER THE FAILURE OF ITS FORMER BILLET CONTRACT. CME VOLUMES GREW BY 89% IN 2018 AND BY ANOTHER 45% LAST YEAR, WHEN THE EQUIVALENT OF ALMOST 3.5 MILLION TONNES TRADED.  SHFE CURRENTLY RUNS THE HIGHEST-VOLUME GLOBAL STEEL CONTRACT. STEEL REBAR VOLUMES DROPPED 12% LAST YEAR BUT STILL TOTAL LED 930 MILLION CONTRACTS. EVEN ALLOWING FOR THE FACT THAT SHFE DOUBLE-COUNTS ITS VOLUMES, A PRACTICE THAT CHANGED AT THE START OF 2020, IT\u2019S STILL A STAGGERING FIGURE.  THE CHINESE EXCHANGE LAST YEAR EXTENDED ITS FERROUS PRODUCT RANGE WITH A NEW STAINLESS CONTRACT, WHICH TRADED 1.2 MILLION LOTS IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS.  QIANHAI SURPRISE  NOT ALL NEW PRODUCTS FLOURISH AND THE LME\u2019S NEW COBALT AND MOLYBDENUM CONTRACTS FAILED TO GET ANY TRACTION LAST YEAR.  THE LACK OF INTEREST IN THE NEW CASH-SETTLED COBALT CONTRACT IS PUZZLING, GIVEN THE STEADY DECLINE IN ACTIVITY IN THE OLDER PHYSICALLY DELIVERABLE CONTRACT, WHICH SAW VOLUMES SLUMP BY 26% LAST YEAR. IT\u2019S NOT AS IF COBALT HASN\u2019T BEEN VOLATILE OR THAT CARMAKERS HAVEN\u2019T EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR A WAY OF HEDGING A KEY INPUT INTO ELECTRIC BATTERIES.  ALSO STRANGE IS THE LACK OF TRACTION GAINED BY EITHER THE CME OR LME ALUMINA CONTRACTS, GIVEN THE SECTOR HAS SWITCHED TOWARDS SPOT PRICING.  CME ALUMINA VOLUMES FELL BY 79% LAST YEAR TO 118,200 TONNES, WHILE THE LME\u2019S NEW ALUMINA CONTRACT NOTCHED UP TRADES OF JUST 46,000 TONNES.  BOTH WERE ECLIPSED BY THE 374,011 TONNES TRADED ON THE QIANHAI MERCANTILE EXCHANGE, HKEX\u2019S FORAY INTO MAINLAND CHINA.  THE QME IS SOMETHING OF AN ANOMALY IN THE GLOBAL METALS EXCHANGE WORLD. BARRED FROM OFFERING FUTURES PRODUCTS IN MAINLAND CHINA, HKEX HAS BEEN BUILDING OUT A PHYSICAL EXCHANGE.  ALUMINA WAS ONE OF FIVE METALLIC OFFERINGS LAUNCHED LAST YEAR. THE OTHERS ARE COPPER CATHODE, COPPER ROD, ALUMINIUM INGOT AND ALUMINIUM BILLET.  IT\u2019S TAKEN SEVERAL YEARS FOR HKEX TO GET THE QME UP AND RUNNING BUT IT IS WORTH WATCHING BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS A CLEAR CHALLENGE TO THE CHINESE INCUMBENT IN SHANGHAI.  THE BIG THREE EXCHANGES CURRENTLY CO-EXIST IN A RELATIVELY PEACEFUL ORDER. WHAT THE CHINESE LIKE TO CALL A \u201cWIN-WIN\u201d SCENARIO MAY NOT LAST LONG IF QME PICKS UP TRADING MOMENTUM.", "Ticker": "CME", "Date": "2020-01-10T00:00:00", "key": "20200110CME", "labelr0": -1.6213364033194202, "labelr1": -0.4632112730996231, "labelr2": -0.2841187420397689, "labelr3": 0.7123206916879488, "labelr4": 1.0438515194380835, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.191, "compound": -0.3818, "0_day_return": -1.6213364033194178, "1_day_return": -1.6213364033194178, "2_day_return": -0.7460139450972902, "3_day_return": -0.03900726510315256, "4_day_return": 1.0044370764054733, "label": -1, "return": 0.0069762152039844535, "excess_return": -1.6283126185234025, "count_of_word": 1151, "pred": -1, "prof-1": 0.73361224, "prof1": 0.26638779999999995, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5029548857287194, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4970451142712806, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.73361224, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.26638779999999995, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.63761914, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.3623808, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5171162, "tr_prof1": 0.48288387, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.43608168, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.5639183000000001, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5931922, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.40680778, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.31144327, "headline_prof21": 0.68855673, "textplusheadline_pred": -1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.55452156, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.44547844, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.4296634, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.57033664, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.5086893, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.49131066, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 1.6213364033194178, "returnpredvader": 1.6213364033194178, "returnpredsgd": 1.6213364033194178, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0229408816193026, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9751898378088888, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.979797440948375, "cumreturn1b": 4.190110128822429, "cumreturn1d": 1.1716529407507665, "cumreturn1e": 1.4532175239604481, "cumreturndow": 1.3099962331167778, "cumreturnsp500": 1.2381886972490583}, {"Unnamed: 0": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16924, "level_0": 16924, "index": 16924, "text": "JAN 13 (REUTERS) - ACASTI PHARMA INC SAID ON MONDAY ITS KRILL OIL-DERIVED DRUG CANDIDATE, CAPRE, WAS NOT MORE EFFECTIVE THAN PLACEBO IN REDUCING HIGH LEVELS OF TRIGLYCERIDES IN A LATE-STAGE STUDY.

IT STANDS VIRTUALLY ALONE AMONG RIVALS IN HAVING LITTLE IF ANY NEED FOR THE USUAL METRICS THAT MEDIA COMPANIES ABIDE BY. INSTEAD, INVESTORS HAVE FOCUSED ON ITS RAPID SUBSCRIBER AND REVENUE GROWTH. THAT HAS FUELED ITS STOCK-MARKET SUCCESS. BUT THE $150 BILLION VIDEO-STREAMING SERVICE\u2019S FOURTH-QUARTER PERFORMANCE, UNVEILED ON TUESDAY, SHOWS HOW THAT IS COMING UNDER THREAT.  NETFLIX SHARES ARE UP MORE THAN FIVEFOLD SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2015, ECLIPSING WALT DISNEY, COMCAST AND AT&T DURING THE SAME PERIOD. ALL THREE HAVE LAUNCHED OR HAVE PLANS FOR DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER SERVICES TO GO HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH NETFLIX.  THE FIRM LED BY REED HASTINGS STANDS APART IN KEY WAYS. FIRST, IT DOESN\u2019T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT TV RATINGS BECAUSE IT\u2019S COMMERCIAL-FREE. THAT\u2019S IN CONTRAST TO COMCAST\u2019S NBC UNIVERSAL, DISNEY\u2019S BROADCAST AND CABLE UNITS AND AT&T\u2019S TURNER SUITE OF CHANNELS. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WATCH A TV SERIES INFORMS HOW MUCH A NETWORK CAN CHARGE FOR ADVERTISING AND CAN BOLSTER NEGOTIATIONS WITH DISTRIBUTORS DURING CONTRACT RENEWALS.  BOX-OFFICE TICKET SALES ARE FOLLOWED OBSESSIVELY IN TINSELTOWN BECAUSE THEY PROVE THE POPULARITY AND VIABILITY OF A MOVIE.

REVENUE IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 BARELY BEAT ANALYSTS\u2019 ESTIMATES, BUT THERE ARE OTHER SIGNS OF STRAIN. THE NET INCREASE IN U.S. SUBSCRIBERS IS WANING IN PART THANKS TO A PRICE HIKE AND NEW ENTRANTS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, NETFLIX MISSED ITS OWN DOMESTIC OUTLOOK FORECAST AS IT DID IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS.

NADELLA MANAGED TO GET PAST BALLMER\u2019S DEALS, DESPITE ADDING A PRICEY-LOOKING TAKEOVER OF HIS OWN WITH LINKEDIN, AND HAS OVERSEEN A LARGELY SUCCESSFUL UPGRADE AND EXPANSION OF ITS SOFTWARE WHILE ALSO GROWING ITS CLOUD-COMPUTING BUSINESS, WHERE REVENUE GREW 62% IN ITS MOST RECENT QUARTER. THAT MAKES IT THE MAIN CONTENDER TO INDUSTRY LEADER AMAZON. OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY HAS INCREASED SIX-FOLD TO $1.3 TRILLION.  THERE\u2019S PLENTY THAT COULD GO WRONG, OF COURSE. KRISHNA, WHO CURRENTLY LEADS THE CLOUD DIVISION, WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE RED HAT DEAL. THAT WAS DESIGNED TO CATAPULT IBM INTO THE CLOUD BUSINESS BUT HAS YET TO SHOW THE PURCHASE WAS WORTH THE PRICE PAID. THE FATE OF FINNISH TELECOM COMPANY NOKIA PROVIDES AN INSTRUMENTAL LESSON ON HOW TURNAROUND ATTEMPTS CAN SPIRAL DOWN. IT WAS ONCE, LIKE IBM, A DOMINANT HARDWARE MAKER BEFORE FALLING ON HARD TIMES. IT SOLD PART OF ITS BUSINESS TO MICROSOFT \u2013 ONE OF BALLMER\u2019S BAD DEALS \u2013 AND SHARES IN THE REST NOW TRADE AT JUST 6% OF THEIR MARKET HIGH IN 2000. YAHOO IS ANOTHER TALE OF WOE. THE INTERNET GIANT\u2019S MAIN BUSINESS LOST ALMOST ALL OF ITS VALUE DURING A 10-YEAR PERIOD BEFORE IT WAS SOLD TO VERIZON.

FILE PHOTO: GENERAL MOTORS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER MARY BARRA ANNOUNCES A MAJOR INVESTMENT FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF GM FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES AT THE GM ORION ASSEMBLY PLANT IN LAKE ORION, MICHIGAN, U.S. MARCH 22, 2019. REUTERS/REBECCA COOK/FILE PHOTO  GM CHIEF EXECUTIVE MARY BARRA AND TOP EXECUTIVES HOSTED AN INVESTOR CONFERENCE IN NEW YORK TO CONVINCE POTENTIAL SHAREHOLDERS GM IS A BURGEONING TECHNOLOGY FIRM AT THE FOREFRONT OF TOMORROW\u2019S ELECTRIC AND SELF-DRIVING CARS.  \u201cWE BELIEVE WE\u2019RE A COMPELLING INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY,\u201d GM CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER DHIVYA SURYADEVARA TOLD REPORTERS AFTER GM REPORTED QUARTERLY RESULTS, WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE RUN-UP IN TESLA\u2019S STOCK.  \u201cFROM A SHARE-PRICE STANDPOINT, WE\u2019RE VERY BULLISH ON THE FUTURE,\u201d SHE ADDED.  BARRA HAS BEEN RESTRUCTURING GM\u2019S OPERATIONS AND STRESSING HER GOALS OF READYING GM FOR A FUTURE OF \u201cZERO EMISSIONS AND ZERO ACCIDENTS\u201d FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  STILL, GM SHARES TRADE JUST ABOVE THE $33 SHARE PRICE OF ITS 2010 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING. THAT HAS LEFT IT WITH A MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF ABOUT $49 BILLION, BELOW TESLA\u2019S VALUATION OF ABOUT $130 BILLION.  \u201cTHE MARKET\u2019S GOT IT WRONG,\u201d SAID CHRIS SUSANIN, CO-PORTFOLIO MANAGER WITH LEVIN EASTERLY PARTNERS, WHICH OWNS SHARES IN GM BUT NOT TESLA. \u201cGM SHOULD BE THE $150 BILLION MARKET CAP, NOT TESLA.\u201d  THE BULK OF GM\u2019S PROFITS IS STILL DERIVED FROM THE FUEL-HUNGRY PICKUP TRUCKS AND SUVS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES. THE CHINESE MARKET HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF A STEADY $2 BILLION IN PROFITS A YEAR, BUT THAT IS THREATENED BY A MARKET SLOWDOWN, RISING COSTS FOR ELECTRIFICATION AND NOW THE DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK.  WHILE CHINA WILL DELIVER LOWER EQUITY INCOME TO GM IN THE NEAR TERM, IT REMAINS A SOLID CONTRIBUTOR THAT IS PROFITABLE AND DIVIDEND PAYING, AND WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVS GLOBALLY, OFFICIALS SAID. GM ALSO SEES GROWTH FOR ITS CADILLAC BRAND IN CHINA.  \u2018HAVE OUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO\u2019  BARRA\u2019S CHALLENGE NOW IS TO ASSURE INVESTORS THAT GM CAN MAKE THE LEAP ACROSS THE GAP SEPARATING ITS PROFITABLE INTERNAL COMBUSTION PRESENT AND AN UNCERTAIN ELECTRIC FUTURE.  WHILE GASOLINE-POWERED VEHICLES WILL MAKE UP A LARGE PORTION OF U.S. SALES INTO THE 2030S, GM HAS SAID IT WILL SPEND MORE ON DEVELOPING ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAN THOSE WITH INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.  GM LAID OUT A MORE DETAILED PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVS AND SELF-DRIVING VEHICLES AT THE INVESTOR DAY, INCLUDING ITS CRUISE SELF-DRIVING UNIT.  SOME ANALYSTS HAVE SUGGESTED GM SHOULD SPIN OFF CRUISE, BUT SURYADEVARA SAID GM HAS NO PLANS TO DO THAT. SHE ADDED THAT SPENDING IN 2020 ON THAT BUSINESS WILL ROUGHLY MATCH LAST YEAR\u2019S $800 MILLION.  CRUISE CEO DAN AMMANN SAID THE SELF-DRIVING MARKET OPPORTUNITY TOTALS $8 TRILLION.  ONE OF THE AUDIENCES FOR THE INVESTOR DAY IS POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES AS GM COMPETES WITH TESLA AND OTHER AUTOMAKERS GLOBALLY TO HIRE TOP ENGINEERS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS OUTSIDE OF DETROIT, HIGHLIGHTING TECHNICAL CENTERS IN ONTARIO AND ISRAEL.  BARRA, ASKED WHETHER TESLA\u2019S EVENTUAL ELECTRIC PICKUP OFFERING COULD SQUEEZE GM\u2019S MARGINS, SAID HER COMPANY UNDERSTANDS THAT BUSINESS. \u201cI THINK WE CAN HAVE OUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO,\u201d SHE SAID.  GM ALSO SAID IT WILL OFFER ITS SUPERCRUISE PARTIALLY AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEM ON 22 MODELS BY THE END OF 2023, GM PRESIDENT MARK REUSS SAID.  GM ALSO LAID OUT ITS PLAN TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING COMPLEXITY THIS YEAR BY ELIMINATING 25% OF THE PARTS USED IN ITS PLANTS. BARRA ALSO SAID GM TARGETS SOURCING ALL OF ITS GLOBAL ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES BY 2040, A DECADE SOONER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROMISED.

REUTERS/ISSEI KATO  CARLYLE WILL REMAIN ACTIVE IN AFRICA WITH ITS OTHER FUNDS, INCLUDING CARLYLE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY PARTNERS.  BUT THE WASHINGTON, D.C.-BASED FIRM SAID IT WOULD NO LONGER PURSUE AN AFRICA-DEDICATED BUYOUT FUND TO SUCCEED ITS $700 MILLION CARLYLE SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA FUND, WHICH IT RAISED IN 2014.  THIS MAKES CARLYLE THE LATEST PRIVATE EQUITY GIANT TO REDUCE ITS AFRICA EXPOSURE AND UNDERSCORES THE CHALLENGES OF DEALMAKING FOR WESTERN PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS USED TO LARGE LEVERAGED BUYOUTS OF MATURE COMPANIES THAT CAN BE SADDLED WITH DEBT.  DEALS IN THE REGION TEND TO BE SMALLER, THE COMPANIES YOUNGER AND THIRSTY FOR CAPITAL, AND OPPORTUNITIES TO CASH OUT FEWER, OFTEN FRAUGHT WITH POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISK.  CARLYLE SAID GENEVIEVE SANGUDI, ERIC KUMP, IDRIS MOHAMMED AND BRUCE STEEN WERE LEAVING TO SET UP A NEW VENTURE DUBBED ALTERRA CAPITAL.  CARLYLE SAID IT WILL HAVE NO STAKE IN ALTERRA, BUT WILL PROVIDE DEAL REFERRALS, ADVICE AND CO-INVESTMENT. ALTERRA WILL ALSO ASSUME MANAGEMENT OF CARLYLE\u2019S SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA FUND AS SUB-ADVISORS STARTING FROM JULY 1.  CARLYLE\u2019S DEALS IN AFRICA HAVE INCLUDED A $147 MILLION BET ON NIGERIA\u2019S DIAMOND BANK, WHICH SOURED AFTER A SHRINKING ECONOMY, A PLUNGING CURRENCY AND AN OIL PRICE SLUMP FUELED A SPATE OF DEFAULTS. ACCESS BANK, ANOTHER NIGERIAN BANK, TOOK OVER DIAMOND BANK LAST YEAR.  CARLYLE ALSO BOUGHT INTO J&J TRANSPORT, A TRANSPORT FIRM WITH MINING CUSTOMERS, AND TRAXYS, WHICH TRADES COMMODITIES AND PROVIDES LOGISTICS.  IN 2017, PEER KKR & CO INC (KKR.N) DISBANDED ITS AFRICA DEALS TEAM AND SOLD OFF ITS CONTROLLING STAKE IN AN ETHIOPIAN ROSE FARM. THAT SAME YEAR, BLACKSTONE GROUP INC (BX.N) SOLD ITS STAKE IN BLACK RHINO GROUP, AN AFRICAN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT FIRM, BACK TO ITS MANAGEMENT.", "Ticker": "CG", "Date": "2020-05-27T00:00:00", "key": "20200527CG", "labelr0": 0.8617594254937108, "labelr1": -0.4271982912068388, "labelr2": -1.1083303539506568, "labelr3": 1.6630513376717313, "labelr4": 2.773826458036976, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.118, "compound": -0.0516, "0_day_return": 0.8617594254937133, "1_day_return": 0.8617594254937133, "2_day_return": -1.5307938768244989, "3_day_return": 0.10679957280170793, "4_day_return": 2.8835884656461137, "label": 1, "return": -0.002107914762090414, "excess_return": 0.8638673402558037, "count_of_word": 329, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.40603890000000004, "prof1": 0.59396106, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4661073950245122, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5338926049754879, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.40603890000000004, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.59396106, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.5671375, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.43286246, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.47999093, "tr_prof1": 0.5200090999999999, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.52446145, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.47553852, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.6312174, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.36878258, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.57195467, "headline_prof21": 0.42804533, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.39899573, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.6010043, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.46640494, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.5335949999999999, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.19979158, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.8002083999999999, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 0.8617594254937133, "returnpredvader": -0.8617594254937133, "returnpredsgd": 0.8617594254937133, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9981803728129106, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9992012479234483, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9985050438864647, "cumreturn1b": 5.149848180668664, "cumreturn1d": 0.9995164433652992, "cumreturn1e": 1.5683707106548233, "cumreturndow": 1.2070492962217856, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0879970552178293}, {"Unnamed: 0": 27912, "Unnamed: 0.1": 27912, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 27912, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 27912, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 27912, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 27912, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 27912, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 27912, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 27912, "level_0": 27912, "index": 27912, "text": "(REUTERS) - TD BANK GROUP (TD.TO) REPORTED A 52% FALL IN QUARTERLY PROFIT ON THURSDAY, AS CANADA\u2019S SECOND-BIGGEST LENDER BY MARKET VALUE SET ASIDE MORE MONEY TO COVER LOAN LOSSES DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

REUTERS/DANIEL BECERRIL  WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - GENERAL MOTORS CO (GM.N) HIT 200,000 TOTAL ELECTRIC VEHICLES SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE END OF 2018, REACHING A THRESHOLD THAT TRIGGERS A PHASE-OUT OF A $7,500 FEDERAL TAX CREDIT OVER THE NEXT 15 MONTHS, A PERSON BRIEFED ON THE MATTER SAID WEDNESDAY.  THE LARGEST U.S. AUTOMAKER REACHED THE FIGURE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WHICH MEANS THE CREDIT WILL FALL TO $3,750 IN APRIL, AND THEN DROP TO $1,875 IN OCTOBER FOR SIX MONTHS. THE CREDIT WILL COMPLETELY DISAPPEAR BY APRIL 2020. THE 200,000 FIGURE COVERS GM\u2019S CUMULATIVE EV SALES SINCE 2010.  THE TAX CREDIT IS AIMED AT DEFRAYING THE COST OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN SIMILARLY SIZED INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE VEHICLES. IN 2009, CONGRESS SET THE PHASE-OUT THRESHOLD AT 200,000 VEHICLES PER MANUFACTURER.  GM, WHICH SAID PREVIOUSLY IT EXPECTED TO REACH THE 200,000 SALES FIGURE BEFORE THE END OF 2018, DECLINED TO COMMENT AHEAD OF THE RELEASE OF ITS QUARTERLY SALES RESULTS ON THURSDAY.  GM AND TESLA INC (TSLA.O), WHICH HIT THE 200,000 FIGURE IN JULY 2018, HAVE BOTH LOBBIED CONGRESS TO LIFT THE CAP OR EXTEND THE EXISTING TAX CREDIT. TESLA\u2019S EV TAX CREDIT FELL TO $3,750 ON TUESDAY AND TESLA SAID IT WAS CUTTING PRICES ON ITS EVS BY $2,000 TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE LOWER TAX CREDIT.  IN MARCH, GM CHIEF EXECUTIVE MARY BARRA CALLED ON CONGRESS TO EXPAND THE CONSUMER TAX CREDIT FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES AS THE COMPANY BOOSTED PRODUCTION OF THE EV BOLT IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMER DEMAND. SHE REPEATED THE REQUEST LAST MONTH DURING A VISIT TO CAPITOL HILL.

EUROPEAN MARKETS WERE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW, WITH BOOKMAKERS PREDICTING LONDON\u2019S FTSE AND FRANKFURT\u2019S DAX WOULD OPEN 0.4 PERCENT LOWER AND PARIS\u2019 CAC40 DOWN 0.6 PERCENT.  APPLE BLAMED FEWER IPHONE UPGRADES AND SLOWING SALES IN CHINA IN ITS MOST RECENT QUARTER, ITS FIRST SUCH WARNING SINCE 2007. ITS SHARES TUMBLED IN AFTER-HOURS TRADE.  THE NEWS SPARKED A \u2018FLASH CRASH\u2019 IN HOLIDAY-THINNED CURRENCY MARKETS AS INVESTORS RUSHED TO LESS RISKY ASSETS, WITH THE JAPANESE YEN SOARING AGAINST MOST MAJOR CURRENCIES IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.  U.S. STOCK FUTURES POINTED TO ANOTHER ROUGH START ON WALL STREET, WITH NASDAQ E-MINI FUTURES DOWN 2.6 PERCENT AND S&P 500 E-MINI FUTURES OFF 1.6 PERCENT.

THE VOLATILE DAY FOR ASIA FOLLOWED SWINGS ON WALL STREET OVERNIGHT, WHERE SHARES SLID IN EARLY TRADE ON GROWTH WORRIES BEFORE CLAWING BACK LOSSES AS SURGING OIL PRICES DROVE GAINS IN ENERGY SHARES.  APPLE SPECIFICALLY HIGHLIGHTED SLOWING CHINESE GROWTH AND SINO-U.S. TRADE TENSIONS, EXACERBATING INVESTORS\u2019 CONCERNS ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.  \u201cTHE FALL IN THE EM MANUFACTURING PMI LAST MONTH WAS FAIRLY BROAD-BASED AND SUPPORTS OUR VIEW THAT GROWTH IN THE EMERGING WORLD AS A WHOLE WILL SLOW THIS YEAR,\u201d GABRIELLA DICKENS, AN ECONOMIST AT CAPITAL ECONOMICS, SAID IN A NOTE.  ADDING TO THE SOUR MOOD, A MEETING BETWEEN U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS PRODUCED NO AGREEMENT TO END A PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.  TRUMP\u2019S DEMAND FOR $5 BILLION IN FUNDING FOR A WALL ALONG THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER TRIGGERED THE SHUTDOWN AFFECTING ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND 800,000 FEDERAL WORKERS.  \u2018FLASH CRASH\u2019  CURRENCY MARKETS SAW A WILD SPIKE IN VOLATILITY IN EARLY ASIAN TRADE, WITH RISK AVERSION PUSHING THE YEN SHARPLY HIGHER AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR, BREAKING KEY TECHNICAL LEVELS AND TRIGGERING STOP-LOSS SALES OF U.S. AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS.  THE DOLLAR WAS LAST 1.9 PERCENT WEAKER AGAINST THE YEN AT 106.85, HAVING EARLIER FALLEN AS LOW AS 104.96, ITS LOWEST LEVEL SINCE MARCH 2018.

GM SAID IN 2017 IT PLANNED BY 2021 TO INTRODUCE A NEW DEDICATED FLEXIBLE ELECTRIC VEHICLE ARCHITECTURE AND AN ADVANCED BATTERY SYSTEM TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AT LEAST 20 NEW MODELS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA.  GM SAID IN 2017 THAT A NEW ELECTRIC VEHICLE PLATFORM IN 2021 WILL SERVE AS A BASE FOR AT LEAST NINE DERIVATIVES, RANGING FROM A COMPACT CROSSOVER TO A LARGE SEVEN-PASSENGER LUXURY SPORTS UTILITY VEHICLE AND A LARGE COMMERCIAL VAN.

HE ADDED THAT CADILLAC WOULD BE \u201cAT THE FOREFRONT\u201d OF ROLLING OUT NEW ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA. HE LEFT GM IN APRIL.  THIS WEEK, GM SAID CADILLAC SALES IN CHINA ROSE 17.2 PERCENT IN 2018, SURPASSING 200,000 UNITS FOR THE FIRST TIME. GM CHIEF EXECUTIVE MARY BARRA HAS SAID THAT GM AIMS TO SELL 1 MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES A YEAR BY 2026, MANY OF THEM IN CHINA, WHICH HAS SET STRICT PRODUCTION QUOTAS ON SUCH VEHICLES.  BARRA SAID IN 2017 THE COMPANY PLANS TO INTRODUCE AT LEAST 10 NEW ELECTRIC OR HYBRID VEHICLES TO THE CHINESE MARKET BY 2020. GM OPENED A BATTERY PLANT WITH CHINESE PARTNER SAIC MOTOR CORP LTD (600104.SS) LAST YEAR.

THE MERGER WILL COMBINE AB INBEV'S BUDWEISER, STELLA ARTOIS AND CORONA BRANDS WITH SABMILLER'S PERONI, GROLSCH AND PILSNER URQUELL AND BREW ALMOST A THIRD OF THE WORLD'S BEER. REUTERS/DAVID W CERNY  HONG KONG (REUTERS BREAKINGVIEWS) - ANHEUSER-BUSCH INBEV EXECUTIVES WHO HOPE FOR A $70 BILLION VALUATION FOR THEIR ASIA BUSINESS DESERVE TO HAVE THEIR BREATH TESTED. THE BELGIAN BREWER IS CONSIDERING AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF PART OF THE UNIT, REUTERS REPORTED ON FRIDAY. THE REGION IS A FAST-GROWING JEWEL IN AB INBEV\u2019S CROWN, BUT IT FACES STIFF COMPETITION IN CHINA, AND HAS STRUGGLED IN INDIA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA. THAT MAKES THE MOOTED PRICE TAG TOUGH TO SWALLOW.  THE BUDWEISER BREWER, HAVING RUN UP $100 BILLION IN DEBT, NEEDS TO DETOX. A MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR HONG KONG LISTING OF ITS ASIAN OPERATIONS WOULD HELP EASE THE BURDEN, WHILE GIVING INVESTORS A SLICE OF ITS FASTEST-GROWING BUSINESS AFTER LATIN AMERICA. THE COMPANY IS THE LEADING PREMIUM BREWER IN CHINA, WHERE CONSUMERS DRINK MORE BUDWEISER THAN THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES, ACCORDING TO RABOBANK RESEARCH. AS OF JUNE 2018 THE COMPANY BOASTED A STELLAR 35 PERCENT EBITDA MARGIN.  THE UNIT IS EXPECTED TO EARN $3 BILLION THIS YEAR BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTISATION, ACCORDING TO BERNSTEIN. ONE THIRD OF THAT WILL COME FROM DEVELOPING MARKETS LIKE CHINA AND INDIA, AND THE REST FROM MATURE MARKETS LIKE AUSTRALIA AND SOUTH KOREA, THE RESEARCH OUTFIT RECKONS. HOWEVER, WHILE AB INBEV LEADS IN CHINA\u2019S PREMIUM SEGMENT, IT FACES STIFF COMPETITION FROM CHINA RESOURCES BEER, WHICH TOOK CONTROL OF HEINEKEN\u2019S CHINA BUSINESS IN AUGUST AND ASPIRES TO BECOME THE PREMIUM MARKET LEADER.  AB INBEV ALSO LAGS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA\u2019S TWO MOST PROMISING MARKETS. IN THAILAND, HEINEKEN IS THE CLEAR MARKET LEADER IN THE PREMIUM BEER SEGMENT, WITH A ROUGHLY 4 PERCENT SHARE AS OF 2017, ACCORDING TO EUROMONITOR; AB INBEV HAS YET TO BREAK INTO THE TOP 10. HEINEKEN ALSO DOMINATES IN VIETNAM, WITH A 22 PERCENT SHARE, VERSUS AB INBEV\u2019S 0.5 PERCENT. AB INBEV OWNS ROUGHLY 20 PERCENT OF THE INDIAN MARKET, BUT THAT REGION POSES CHALLENGES. CONSUMERS THERE TEND TO DRINK IN MODERATION, AND PREFER SPIRITS TO BEER. BREWERS ARE ALSO GRAPPLING WITH A PRICE-FIXING PROBE.  THIS MAKES THE ROUGHLY $70 BILLION VALUATION, REPORTED BY BLOOMBERG, HARD TO JUSTIFY. THE PRICE IS EQUIVALENT TO 23 TIMES EXPECTED 2018 EBITDA; CR BEER TRADES CLOSER TO 15 TIMES.

REUTERS/JIM BOURG/FILE PHOTO  THE SHORT SUPPLY REPRESENTS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR TEVA TO COMPETE WITH MYLAN NV IN A ROUGHLY $750 MILLION A YEAR U.S. MARKET. MYLAN\u2019S EPIPEN DOMINATES THAT MARKET, BUT HAS BEEN IN SHORT SUPPLY SINCE MAY, LEAVING MANY PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES KEEN FOR ALTERNATIVES.  \u201cTHE GENERIC VERSION OF EPIPEN AUTO-INJECTOR IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO BUILD SUPPLY,\u201d TEVA SAID IN AN EMAILED STATEMENT. \u201cWE ARE ACTIVELY MANUFACTURING AND SHIPPING PRODUCT THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.\u201d  THE COMPANY DID NOT SAY WHY ITS DRUG WAS IN SHORT SUPPLY.  ISRAEL-BASED TEVA, THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST GENERIC DRUGMAKER, RECEIVED U.S. APPROVAL FOR ITS VERSION OF EPIPEN IN AUGUST AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF DELAY. AT THE TIME, THE COMPANY PLEDGED ITS \u201cFULL RESOURCES TO THIS IMPORTANT LAUNCH IN THE COMING MONTHS.\u201d  THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAILED THE PRODUCT AS A LOWER-COST OPTION FOR PATIENTS WHO DEPEND ON ACCESS TO THE EPIPEN AND SIMILAR HANDHELD DEVICES THAT MAKE IT EASIER TO DELIVER EPINEPHRINE IN THE CASE OF A SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION, SUCH AS TO BEE STINGS OR EXPOSURE TO PEANUTS.  MYLAN\u2019S EPIPEN HAS BEEN IN SHORT SUPPLY DUE TO MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS AT THE LONE PFIZER INC PLANT THAT MAKES THE AUTO-INJECTORS.  \u201cWE ARE CONTINUING TO GET PANICKED PHONE CALLS FROM PARENTS BECAUSE THEY CAN\u2019T GET EPINEPHRINE FOR THEIR KIDS,\u201d SAID KIM MUDD, NURSE MANAGER OF JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY\u2019S PEDIATRIC ALLERGY UNIT.  IN LATE NOVEMBER, TEVA SAID ITS GENERIC EPIPEN FOR ADULTS WAS AVAILABLE IN LIMITED SUPPLY IN THE UNITED STATES AND PROMISED THAT MORE OF THE PRODUCT, AS WELL AS A VERSION FOR CHILDREN, WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN 2019. REUTERS CHECKS IN LATE JANUARY SUGGEST THAT EVEN THE AVAILABLE SUPPLY HAS DWINDLED.  \u201cWE GET REPORTS FROM PHARMACIES AND WE\u2019VE BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM WITH THE SUPPLIERS THAT THEY ARE ON BACK ORDER,\u201d SAID ERIN FOX, A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH.  FOX MAINTAINS AN INDEPENDENT DRUG SHORTAGES LIST FOR THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEALTH-SYSTEM PHARMACISTS (ASHP), AND ADDED THE TEVA VERSION OF EPIPEN TO THE ROSTER THIS WEEK. THE DEVICE ALSO APPEARS ON THE FDA LIST OF DRUGS IN SHORTAGE.  CVS HEALTH CORP SAID IT HAD RECEIVED LIMITED SUPPLIES OF THE TEVA DEVICE LATE LAST YEAR, BUT DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ANY IN STOCK. WALMART INC IS NOT CURRENTLY CARRYING TEVA\u2019S EPIPEN IN ITS PHARMACIES, ACCORDING TO A SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER.  FOX SAID PHARMACIES ARE ALSO CURRENTLY UNABLE TO ORDER THE DEVICES THROUGH MAJOR DISTRIBUTORS CARDINAL HEALTH INC OR AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORP. AN AMERISOURCEBERGEN SPOKESWOMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT AND CARDINAL HEALTH DID NOT IMMEDIATELY RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT.  WALGREENS SAID IT CURRENTLY HAS LIMITED SUPPLY OF CERTAIN GENERIC EPINEPHRINE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING TEVA\u2019S, IN SOME OF ITS PHARMACIES. CIGNA CORP\u2019S EXPRESS SCRIPTS UNIT SAID IT HAS LIMITED SUPPLY OF THE TEVA DEVICES IN ITS HOME DELIVERY PHARMACY.  POTENTIAL PROFIT-BOOSTER  WALL STREET HAS VIEWED THE EPIPEN RIVAL AS A WELCOME PROFIT-BOOSTER FOR TEVA AS IT CONTENDS WITH SHARPLY DECLINING U.S. MARGINS FOR ITS OLDER GENERIC MEDICINES AND A SERIES OF COSTLY ACQUISITIONS. THE DRUGMAKER HAS FIRED THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES AND WORKED TO REDUCE ITS DEBT.  WHEN THE DEVICE\u2019S APPROVAL WAS ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR, TEVA\u2019S U.S.-LISTED SHARES JUMPED ABOUT 6 PERCENT. WALL STREET ANALYSTS SUGGESTED THEN THAT IT COULD ADD $250 MILLION TO TEVA\u2019S REVENUE ANNUALLY, AND ACCOUNT FOR AN ADDITIONAL 4 CENTS TO 6 CENTS PER SHARE IN EARNINGS.  ANALYSTS, ON AVERAGE, EXPECT THE COMPANY TO POST EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $2.80 IN 2019, ACCORDING TO IBES DATA FROM REFINITIV.

QUALCOMM HAS SOUGHT TO APPLY PRESSURE TO APPLE WITH SMALLER LEGAL CHALLENGES AHEAD OF THAT TRIAL AND HAS WON PARTIAL IPHONE SALES BANS IN CHINA AND GERMANY AGAINST APPLE, FORCING THE IPHONE MAKER TO SHIP ONLY PHONES WITH QUALCOMM CHIPS TO SOME MARKETS.  ANY POSSIBLE BAN ON IPHONE IMPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES COULD BE SHORT-LIVED BECAUSE APPLE LAST WEEK FOR THE FIRST TIME DISCLOSED THAT IT HAS FOUND A SOFTWARE FIX TO AVOID INFRINGING ON ONE OF QUALCOMM\u2019S PATENTS. APPLE ASKED REGULATORS TO GIVE IT AS MUCH AS SIX MONTHS TO PROVE THAT THE FIX WORKS.  QUALCOMM BROUGHT A CASE AGAINST APPLE AT THE U.S INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION IN 2017 ALLEGING THAT SOME IPHONES VIOLATED QUALCOMM PATENTS TO HELP SMART PHONES RUN WELL WITHOUT DRAINING THEIR BATTERIES. QUALCOMM ASKED FOR AN IMPORT BAN ON SOME OLDER IPHONE MODELS CONTAINING INTEL CORP CHIPS.  IN SEPTEMBER, THOMAS PENDER, AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE AT THE ITC, FOUND THAT APPLE VIOLATED ONE OF THE PATENTS IN THE CASE BUT DECLINED TO ISSUE A BAN. PENDER REASONED THAT IMPOSING A BAN ON INTEL-CHIPPED IPHONES WOULD HAND QUALCOMM AN EFFECTIVE MONOPOLY ON THE U.S. MARKET FOR MODEM CHIPS, WHICH CONNECT SMART PHONES TO WIRELESS DATA NETWORKS.  PENDER\u2019S RULING SAID THAT PRESERVING COMPETITION IN THE MODEM CHIP MARKET WAS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST AS SPEEDIER 5G NETWORKS COME ONLINE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.  CASES WHERE THE ITC FINDS PATENT VIOLATIONS BUT DOES NOT BAN THE IMPORT OF PRODUCTS ARE RARE. IN DECEMBER, THE FULL ITC SAID IT WOULD REVIEW PENDER\u2019S DECISION AND DECIDE WHETHER TO UPHOLD OR REVERSE IT BY LATE MARCH.  IN FILINGS THAT BECAME PUBLIC LATE LAST WEEK AHEAD OF THE FULL COMMISSION\u2019S DECISION, APPLE FOR THE FIRST TIME SAID THAT IT HAD DEVELOPED A SOFTWARE FIX TO AVOID RUNNING AFOUL OF QUALCOMM\u2019S PATENT. APPLE SAID IT DID NOT DISCOVER THE FIX UNTIL AFTER THE TRIAL AND THAT IT IMPLEMENTED THE NEW SOFTWARE \u201cLAST FALL.\u201d  BUT APPLE SAID THAT IT WOULD NEED SIX MONTHS TO VERIFY THAT THE FIX WILL SATISFY REGULATORS AND TO SELL ITS EXISTING INVENTORY. APPLE ASKED THE FULL COMMISSION TO DELAY ANY POSSIBLE IMPORT BAN BY THAT LONG IF THE COMMISSION REVERSES THE JUDGE\u2019S DECISIONS.  IN A FILING LATE ON FRIDAY, QUALCOMM ARGUED THAT APPLE\u2019S DISCLOSURE OF A FIX UNDERMINED THE REASONING IN PENDER\u2019S DECISION AND THAT THE INTEL-CHIPPED PHONES SHOULD BE BANNED WHILE APPLE DEPLOYS ITS FIX.  \u201cPENDER RECOMMENDED AGAINST A REMEDY ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE (QUALCOMM) PATENT WOULD PRECLUDE APPLE FROM USING INTEL AS A SUPPLIER FOR MANY YEARS AND THAT NO REDESIGN WAS FEASIBLE,\u201d QUALCOMM WROTE. \u201cAPPLE NOW ADMITS\u2014MORE THAN SEVEN MONTHS AFTER THE HEARING\u2014THAT THE ALLEGED HARM IS ENTIRELY AVOIDABLE.\u201d", "Ticker": "AAPL", "Date": "2019-02-20T00:00:00", "key": "20190220AAPL", "labelr0": 0.6435382905282832, "labelr1": -0.5638551415450787, "labelr2": 1.116567286332279, "labelr3": 0.7284500202347176, "labelr4": 0.05739539688918253, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.265, "compound": -0.5574, "0_day_return": 0.6435382905282783, "1_day_return": 0.6435382905282783, "2_day_return": 0.5464163227343999, "3_day_return": 1.2788467127826442, "4_day_return": 1.336976108818222, "label": 1, "return": -0.003526436662044688, "excess_return": 0.6470647271903229, "count_of_word": 537, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5443975000000001, "prof1": 0.45560256, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4774365663247129, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5225634336752871, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5443975000000001, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.45560256, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.38450506, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.6154949000000001, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.4691151, "tr_prof1": 0.5308849, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5488420999999999, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.45115793, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.48116577, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.5188343, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.61487484, "headline_prof21": 0.38512516, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.42733282, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5726671999999999, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.28277457, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.7172254, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.362244, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.63775605, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 0.6435382905282783, "returnpredvader": -0.6435382905282783, "returnpredsgd": 0.6435382905282783, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0020208218559044, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0049660505986773, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0024946286693954, "cumreturn1b": 1.2295205910559943, "cumreturn1d": 1.0667470114394175, "cumreturn1e": 1.2306755456278646, "cumreturndow": 1.1055166077457306, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1072716891413106}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2463, "Unnamed: 0.1": 2463, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 2463, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 2463, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 2463, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 2463, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 2463, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 2463, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 2463, "level_0": 2463, "index": 2463, "text": "FILE PHOTO: THE LOGO OF BRAZILIAN PLANEMAKER EMBRAER SA IS SEEN AT THE COMPANY'S HEADQUARTERS IN SAO JOSE DOS CAMPOS, BRAZIL FEBRUARY 28, 2018.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE ELON MUSK\u2019S ANNOUNCEMENT ON THURSDAY THAT THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE MAKER WOULD CLOSE \u201cMANY\u201d OF ITS STORES AROUND THE WORLD TO SELL CARS ONLINE-ONLY REMOVES THE ONLY RETAIL OUTLET FOR SOLAR SALES SINCE MUSK PULLED THE PLUG ON A PARTNERSHIP WITH HOME DEPOT LAST JUNE.  \u201cSOLAR IS NOW THE STEPCHILD AT TESLA.

MUSK CAST THE DEAL AS A \u201cNO-BRAINER\u201d RIFE WITH SYNERGIES, IN WHICH CUSTOMERS COULD BE SOLD BOTH CARS AND SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, THE COMPANY DEPLOYED 73 MEGAWATTS OF RETROFIT SOLAR SYSTEMS, DOWN 21 PERCENT FROM THE PRIOR QUARTER AND WELL BELOW SOLARCITY\u2019S MORE THAN 200 MEGAWATTS A QUARTER IN EARLY 2016. TOTAL ENERGY GENERATION AND STORAGE REVENUE FELL 7 PERCENT FROM THE PRIOR QUARTER TO $371.5 MILLION.  BESIDES SELLING PRIVATE-LABEL AND THIRD-PARTY SOLAR PANELS, TESLA SELLS ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS FOR HOME AND BUSINESS USE, SO-CALLED POWERWALLS AND POWERPACKS. TESLA HAS SAID NEARLY ALL POWERWALL-ONLY ORDERS ARE PLACED VIA THE WEB OR CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY SOLAR INSTALLERS.  INSTALLATIONS OF THE SOLAR ROOF TILES UNVEILED BY MUSK IN 2016 ARE AT A \u201cSLOW PACE,\u201d TESLA SAID IN ITS 2018 ANNUAL REPORT, DUE TO DESIGN CHANGES. PROGRESS AT TESLA\u2019S SOLAR FACTORY IN BUFFALO, NEW YORK, WHERE THE TILES ARE TO BE MANUFACTURED, MEANWHILE, HAS BEEN STALLED BY ASSEMBLY-LINE PROBLEMS.  ONE FORMER SOLAR SELLER LAID OFF IN JANUARY TOLD REUTERS THAT 70 PERCENT OF LEADS ON SOLAR HAD COME FROM HOME DEPOT. UPPER MANAGEMENT AT TESLA \u201cDIDN\u2019T APPRECIATE THE SIGNIFICANCE\u201d OF THE DEAL WITH THE BIG-BOX RETAILER, THE SOURCE SAID.  \u201cIF YOU WANT TO GO MASS VOLUME, YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER THE CUSTOMERS,\u201d THE SOURCE SAID. \u201cSOLAR ISN\u2019T SEXY ENOUGH TO HAVE THE CUSTOMER COME TO YOU.\u201d  MUSK SAID TESLA WILL STILL KEEP OPEN A SMALL NUMBER OF STORES IN HIGH-TRAFFIC LOCATIONS AS GALLERIES AND INFORMATION CENTERS, WHERE DETAILS ABOUT ENERGY PRODUCTS WILL ALSO BE OFFERED.  WHEN CUSTOMERS ORDER A CAR ON TESLA\u2019S WEBSITE, THEY ARE ALERTED DURING THE CONFIGURATION PROCESS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF ORDERING SOLAR OR OTHER ENERGY PRODUCTS.  IN JANUARY, TESLA SAID IT WAS \u201cSTILL IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING OUR SALES CHANNEL FROM FORMER PARTNERS TO OUR TESLA STORES AND TRAINING OUR SALES TEAM TO SELL SOLAR SYSTEMS IN ADDITION TO VEHICLES.\u201d  BUT FORMER SOLAR SALESPEOPLE TOLD REUTERS THAT TESLA HAD ALREADY PUT SOLAR ON THE BACK BURNER, WITH TESLA-BRANDED PANELS NOT EVEN AVAILABLE FOR INSTALLATIONS IN THE LATTER HALF OF 2018.  \u201cTHEY\u2019D TELL US THE FOCUS OF THE COMPANY IS THE MODEL 3,\u201d SAID ONE FORMER SELLER, WHO LEFT THE COMPANY IN JANUARY. \u201cTHE MODEL 3 HAS TO BE SUCCESSFUL OR THERE\u2019S NO COMPANY.\u201d (REPORTING BY ALEXANDRIA SAGE; EDITING BY GREG MITCHELL AND LESLIE ADLER)", "Ticker": "TSLA", "Date": "2019-03-04T00:00:00", "key": "20190304TSLA", "labelr0": -3.1988873435326868, "labelr1": -3.0908326324642528, "labelr2": -0.10848340203949207, "labelr3": 0.1267014190558811, "labelr4": 2.7296720778046963, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.0, "0_day_return": -3.1988873435326863, "1_day_return": -3.1988873435326863, "2_day_return": -3.1959629941127115, "3_day_return": -3.073310905522864, "4_day_return": -0.4275301373703466, "label": -1, "return": -0.001131533091488267, "excess_return": -3.1977558104411976, "count_of_word": 791, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.54656667, "prof1": 0.45343328, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5234220747546794, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4765779252453207, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.54656667, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.45343328, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.5578877, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.44211236, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.64410037, "tr_prof1": 0.35589963, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.52730906, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.47269088, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.6401094, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.35989055, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.39034617, "headline_prof21": 0.60965383, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.45066562, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5493344, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.59326667, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.4067333, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.7844369999999999, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.21556291, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 3.1988873435326863, "returnpredvader": 3.1988873435326863, "returnpredsgd": 3.1988873435326863, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0001560696816578, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9987499047108425, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0015481762895906, "cumreturn1b": 1.260875390054521, "cumreturn1d": 1.0814196941191387, "cumreturn1e": 1.2632538394418966, "cumreturndow": 1.1114010070673934, "cumreturnsp500": 1.105387017367227}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3077, "Unnamed: 0.1": 3077, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 3077, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 3077, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 3077, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 3077, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 3077, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 3077, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 3077, "level_0": 3077, "index": 3077, "text": "FILE PHOTO: THE CHECK-IN AREA OF JETBLUE AIRWAYS IS SEEN AT JOHN F.

GAS TERMINALS AND STORAGE TANKS, IN WHICH CHINA NATIONAL OFFSHORE OIL CORP, PARENT OF CNOOC LTD, IS AMONG THE TOP INVESTORS, COULD BE THE NEXT ASSETS TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE PIPELINE GROUP THAT IS LIKELY TO BE LAUNCHED THIS YEAR, INDUSTRY SOURCES FOLLOWING THE REFORM PLAN SAID.

THE BUSINESS COULD REAP STATE-RUN CNOOC TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IN RELATIVELY RISK-FREE REVENUE.  BROADER ACCESS TO ITS 20 OR SO RECEIVING TERMINALS - ALL BUILT BY STATE MAJORS EXCEPT FOR A FEW BY PRIVATE FIRMS INCLUDING ENN - WOULD LIKELY BOOST LNG IMPORTS INTO CHINA. CHINA HAS BEEN THE WORLD\u2019S SECOND-BIGGEST BUYER OF LNG SINCE 2017, WITH ITS INTAKE GROWING MORE THAN 40 PERCENT A YEAR IN EACH OF THE PAST TWO YEARS.

THE EXECUTIVE DECLINED TO BE NAMED AS HE\u2019S NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPEAK TO PRESS.  CNOOC DID NOT RESPOND TO REUTERS\u2019 REQUEST FOR COMMENT.  CNOOC SOLD TWO FIVE-DAY TERMINAL SLOTS LATE LAST YEAR VIA OPEN TENDERS, GAINING 63 MILLION YUAN ($9.39 MILLION) OUT OF THE SALES.  IN ONE OF THE DEALS, PRIVATE FIRM SHENGTONG TEAMED UP WITH STATE-OWNED ZHENHUA OIL. THE SECOND DEAL WAS DONE BY PRIVATE LNG DISTRIBUTOR ZHEJIANG PANERGY.  THE SALES ENCOURAGED CNOOC TO BROADEN THE OPENINGS, AND THE LATEST INITIATIVE OF OFFERING LONG-TERM TERMINAL ACCESS WOULD ALSO MAKE CNOOC APPEAR SUPPORTIVE OF BEIJING\u2019S PUSH TO OPEN STATE INFRASTRUCTURE TO THIRD PARTIES, THE SOURCES SAID.

REUTERS/STEPHEN LAM  NEW YORK (REUTERS BREAKINGVIEWS) - APPLE HAS ONE BIG CHALLENGE \u2013 CREATE NEW REVENUE STREAMS \u2013 AND MANY LESS THAN CONVINCING SOLUTIONS. CHIEF EXECUTIVE TIM COOK UNVEILED A DIZZYING ARRAY OF NEW SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES ON MONDAY THAT COVER NEWS, TELEVISION AND GAMING. THE $880 BILLION TECH FIRM INTRODUCED A CREDIT CARD TOO. THE OFFERINGS RANGED FROM CONFUSING TO MILDLY INNOVATIVE.  THE BAR FOR APPLE LAUNCHES WAS SET HIGH MORE THAN A DECADE AGO BY THE IPHONE. IT WAS REVOLUTIONARY AND DESTRUCTIVE. NEARLY ALL THE LEADING HANDSET MAKERS AT THE TIME \u2013 BLACKBERRY, NOKIA, MOTOROLA \u2013 SAW THEIR BUSINESSES UPENDED.  THE SLOWDOWN IN IPHONE SALES JUSTIFIES SWITCHING FROM DEVICE SALES \u2013 WHICH STILL MAKE UP ALMOST $9 OF EVERY $10 APPLE MAKES \u2013 TO SUBSCRIPTIONS. THAT\u2019S WHERE THE NEW PRODUCTS COME IN. NEWS PLUS OFFERS 300 MAGAZINE TITLES LIKE PEOPLE AND COSMOPOLITAN AND A SMATTERING OF NEWSPAPERS FOR SOME $10 A MONTH. NICE, BUT HARDLY COMPREHENSIVE. THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE WASHINGTON POST ARE NOTABLY ABSENT. SEPARATELY, APPLE IS ALSO GETTING INTO GAMING.  WHERE COOK HAS HIS WORK CUT OUT IS IN TAKING ON NETFLIX, THE VIDEO STREAMING COMPANY. AFTER 10 YEARS OF TINKERING, APPLE HAS NOW GONE ALL-IN WITH A SERVICE ENDORSED BY HOLLYWOOD STARS LIKE OPRAH WINFREY AND STEVEN SPIELBERG. BUT APPLE TV PLUS IS A MASHUP OF DIFFERENT TIERS, CHANNELS AND PARTNERSHIPS \u2013 FAR FROM SIMPLE.  MORE PROMISING IS THE GOLDMAN SACHS-BACKED CREDIT CARD. APPLE IS TOUTING EASE, SECURITY, CONVENIENCE AND CASH INCENTIVES TO LURE IN CUSTOMERS. IT COMES WITH NOVELTIES LIKE HAVING NO CARD NUMBER. IT COULD AT LEAST PUSH ENTRENCHED FINANCIAL PLAYERS JPMORGAN, CAPITAL ONE, BANK OF AMERICA AND CITIGROUP TO UP THEIR GAME. BUT IT\u2019S HARDLY INDUSTRY-CHANGING, OR LIKELY TO UNSEAT THE OLIGOPOLY. THOSE FOUR ALREADY HAVE MORE THAN HALF THE U.S. MARKET, ACCORDING TO ACCENTURE DATA.  THE TROUBLE IS NOTHING THAT WAS REVEALED IN COOK\u2019S TWO-HOUR EVENT ON MONDAY WAS A MUST-HAVE FOR CONSUMERS. THAT\u2019S REFLECTED IN THE MARKET RESPONSE \u2013 NEITHER APPLE\u2019S SHARES, NOR THOSE OF TARGETS LIKE WALT DISNEY, NETFLIX OR THE BIG BANKS, MOVED MUCH. COMPARE THAT WITH THE DAY AMAZON BOUGHT RETAIL CHAIN WHOLE FOODS IN 2017, WIPING SOME $38 BILLION IN MARKET VALUE FROM THE RETAIL SECTOR IN A SINGLE DAY, ACCORDING TO CITI.

WANT MORE ON THE CASE? LISTEN TO THE ON THE CASE PODCAST.  THE INJUNCTION MOTION, WHICH FOLLOWS A MARCH 1 LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY, WAS FILED BY THE DORIS BEHR 2012 IRREVOCABLE TRUST. THE TRUST, WHICH IS ADVISED BY HARVARD LAW PROFESSOR EMERITUS (AND ARBITRATION PROPONENT) HAL SCOTT, WANTS THE COURT TO COMPEL J&J TO ALLOW SHAREHOLDERS TO VOTE ON A PROPOSED BYLAW PRECLUDING SECURITIES CLASS ACTIONS AND DIRECTING INVESTORS TO RESOLVE CLAIMS IN INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION. (YES, THAT\u2019S RIGHT: THE TRUST, A SHAREHOLDER, WANTS A BYLAW THAT WOULD END SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTIONS.)  J&J, AS I\u2019LL EXPLAIN, OPPOSES THE BYLAW. ITS LAWYERS AT SKADDEN ARPS SLATE MEAGHER & FLOM DIDN\u2019T RESPOND TO MY REQUEST FOR COMMENT ON THE TRUST\u2019S PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION MOTION BUT SAID IN A LETTER WEDNESDAY TO THE JUDGE OVERSEEING THE CASE THAT THERE\u2019S NO NEED FOR URGENCY AND THAT THE TRUST\u2019S ARGUMENTS ARE CONTRARY TO THE WEIGHT OF AUTHORITY.  SCOTT AND THE TRUST FIRST PROPOSED A SHAREHOLDER VOTE ON MANDATORY ARBITRATION LAST NOVEMBER. THAT PROPOSAL, AS YOU MAY RECALL, LED TO A BLOWUP AT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. JOHNSON & JOHNSON\u2019S SKADDEN LAWYERS INFORMED THE SEC IN DECEMBER THAT THE COMPANY CONSIDERED THE PROPOSAL A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAW. J&J, THEY SAID, INTENDED TO EXCLUDE THE BEHR TRUST\u2019S PROPOSAL FROM PROXY MATERIALS AND FROM A SHAREHOLDER VOTE. THE COMPANY ASKED THE SEC\u2019S CORPORATE FINANCE DIVISION FOR REASSURANCE THAT THE COMMISSION WOULD NOT BRING AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY FOR BLOCKING THE PROPOSED RESOLUTION.  IN THE PAST, THE SEC HAS PUSHED BACK HARD AGAINST SHAREHOLDER ARBITRATION, INCLUDING 2012 PROPOSALS BY SHAREHOLDERS AT GANNETT AND PFIZER THAT PRESAGED THE BEHR TRUST\u2019S J&J PROPOSAL. BUT SOME SEC COMMISSIONERS HAVE LATELY ANNOUNCED SUPPORT FOR MANDATORY SHAREHOLDER ARBITRATION PROVISIONS AND SEC CHAIRMAN JAY CLAYTON HAS BEEN NOTABLY NON-COMMITTAL ON THE ISSUE. ARBITRATION OPPONENTS SAW THE TRUST\u2019S J&J PROPOSAL AS A THREAT - AND MOBILIZED OPPOSITION.  THE SEC ENDED UP AGREEING THAT J&J COULD BLOCK THE PROPOSAL, RELYING MOSTLY ON A LAST-MINUTE OPINION FROM NEW JERSEY\u2019S ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT SAID MANDATORY ARBITRATION WAS ILLEGAL UNDER STATE LAW. NOTABLY, HOWEVER, THE SEC SEEMED TO BACK AWAY FROM ITS PREVIOUS POSITION THAT REQUIRING SHAREHOLDERS TO ARBITRATE WOULD VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW \u2013 POSSIBLY IN RECOGNITION OF PRO-ARBITRATION RULINGS BY THE U.S. SUPREME COURT IN 2013\u2019S AMERICAN EXPRESS V. ITALIAN COLORS AND 2018\u2019S EPIC SYSTEMS V. LEWIS.  THAT SHIFT BY THE SEC, SCOTT TOLD ME WEDNESDAY, WAS CRITICAL TO THE TRUST\u2019S DECISION TO GO TO COURT TO DEMAND J&J PUT ITS ARBITRATION PROPOSAL TO A SHAREHOLDER VOTE. BY BASING ITS DECISION ON THE NEW JERSEY AG\u2019S VIEW OF NEW JERSEY LAW, SCOTT SAID, THE SEC LEFT OPEN THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE AG\u2019S INTERPRETATION IS CORRECT \u2013 AND FAILED ENTIRELY TO ADDRESS THE TRUST\u2019S ARGUMENTS THAT THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT PREEMPTS STATE LAW NO MATTER WHAT NEW JERSEY HAS TO SAY ABOUT MANDATORY SHAREHOLDER ARBITRATION.  THE TRUST, WHICH IS REPRESENTED IN THE NEW LITIGATION AGAINST JOHNSON & JOHNSON BY JONATHAN MITCHELL OF MITCHELL LAW, LAYS OUT ITS CASE COMPREHENSIVELY IN TUESDAY\u2019S PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION BRIEF, WHICH SEEKS A DECLARATION THAT J&J VIOLATED FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS BY EXCLUDING THE TRUST\u2019S PROPOSAL AND AN INJUNCTION REQUIRING J&J TO ANNOUNCE IN A SUPPLEMENTAL PROXY STATEMENT THAT MANDATORY SHAREHOLDER ARBITRATION IS LEGAL UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. J&J HAS ALREADY SENT OUT PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE SCHEDULED APRIL 25 MEETING, OMITTING MENTION OF THE BEHR TRUST\u2019S PROPOSAL.  ACCORDING TO THE TRUST\u2019S INJUNCTION BRIEF, J&J BEARS THE BURDEN OF PROVING ITS PROPOSAL IS ILLEGAL AND THE COMPANY HAS BEEN UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY FEDERAL STATUTE OR NEW JERSEY LAW OR LEGAL PRECEDENT THAT PRECLUDES MANDATORY SHAREHOLDER ARBITRATION. THE TRUST ARGUES THAT AFTER THE SUPREME COURT\u2019S DECISIONS IN EPIC AND ITALIAN COLORS, SUCH PROVISIONS ARE PERMISSIBLE UNDER FEDERAL LAW BECAUSE NOTHING IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE ACT IMPLIES A PARTIAL REPEAL OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. (I\u2019M CONDENSING A NUANCED, MULTI-PRONGED ARGUMENT BUT THAT\u2019S THE GIST.) THE TRUST CONTENDS THAT THE NEW JERSEY AG ERRONEOUSLY BASED HIS CONCLUSION ABOUT THE STATE-LAW LEGALITY OF MANDATORY ARBITRATION ON A RECENT DELAWARE RULING ON FORUM SELECTION IN CORPORATE CHARTERS \u2013 AND EVEN IF THE AG WERE CORRECT IN HIS INTERPRETATION, THE FAA TRUMPS STATE LAW.  \u201cTHERE IS NO NEED FOR THIS COURT TO EXPLORE THE CONTOURS OF NEW JERSEY LAW OR ENGAGE IN \u2026 GUESSES ABOUT WHAT THE NEW JERSEY COURTS MIGHT DO,\u201d THE BRIEF SAID. \u201cIF THE LAW OF NEW JERSEY PURPORTS TO PROHIBIT A CORPORATION AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS FROM AGREEING TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES, THEN THAT LAW IS PREEMPTED BY THE FAA.\u201d  IN A LETTER FILED WEDNESDAY WITH U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE MICHAEL SHIPP OF TRENTON, J&J COUNSEL ANDREW MUSCATO OF SKADDEN SAID THE TRUST HAS MANUFACTURED URGENCY AFTER WAITING WEEKS TO FILE A COMPLAINT AND INJUNCTION MOTION. \u201cCONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT FROM THE APPLICATION IS ANY ATTEMPT TO DEMONSTRATE EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES,\u201d THE LETTER SAID. \u201cPLAINTIFF DID NOT FILE SUIT UNTIL MARCH 21 \u2014 MORE THAN FOUR AND A HALF MONTHS AFTER IT KNEW JOHNSON & JOHNSON INTENDED TO EXCLUDE THE PROPOSAL, ALMOST SIX WEEKS AFTER THE SEC ISSUED ITS NO-ACTION LETTER AND EIGHT DAYS AFTER THE COMPANY FILED (AND MAILED AND/OR MADE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY) ITS PROXY MATERIALS.\u201d  J&J ALSO PREVIEWED THE MERITS OF ITS ARGUMENT AGAINST MANDATORY SHAREHOLDER ARBITRATION. \u201c(THE TRUST\u2019S) THEORY IS BUILT UPON THE NOTION THAT EVERYONE ELSE GOT IT WRONG,\u201d THE COMPANY\u2019S LETTER SAID. \u201cIN ACTUALITY, (THE TRUST) HAS NO LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS, AS EVIDENCED BY THE NUMEROUS AUTHORITIES IT DISMISSES AS WRONG, INCLUDING THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY\u2019S CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER.\u201d  MUSCATO DIDN\u2019T RESPOND TO MY EMAIL REQUEST FOR COMMENT. PLAINTIFFS\u2019 ADVOCACY GROUPS WILL PROBABLY ALSO WANT A SAY IN THIS CASE. AFTER THE TRUST SUED, THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF JUSTICE AND THE SECURE OUR SAVINGS COALITION, WHICH IS LED BY PUBLIC JUSTICE AND THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA, ISSUED STATEMENTS WARNING THAT THE MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS THE BEHR TRUST IS ADVOCATING WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR CORPORATIONS TO DEFRAUD INVESTORS. \u201cWE WILL CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THIS EFFORT AND ANY OTHERS THAT AIM TO SHIELD UNSCRUPULOUS CORPORATIONS FROM ACCOUNTABILITY BY HIDING BEHIND FORCED ARBITRATION CLAUSES,\u201d THE AAJ STATEMENT SAID.  TRUST LAWYER SCOTT TOLD ME HE JUST WANTS TO GIVE J&J SHAREHOLDERS A CHANCE TO VOTE ON MANDATORY ARBITRATION. \u201cI BELIEVE IT\u2019S THEY WHO SHOULD MAKE THE DECISION,\u201d HE SAID. \u201cI WANT TO GIVE THEM A CHOICE.\u201d", "Ticker": "JNJ", "Date": "2019-03-27T00:00:00", "key": "20190327JNJ", "labelr0": 0.09381540015876123, "labelr1": 0.129776496034612, "labelr2": 0.6552419354838686, "labelr3": -0.5794405894556136, "labelr4": -0.9138005468412592, "pos": 0.098, "neg": 0.22, "compound": -0.3818, "0_day_return": 0.09381540015875878, "1_day_return": 0.12977649603460595, "2_day_return": 0.7858687815428977, "3_day_return": 0.20187454938715987, "4_day_return": -0.7137707281903327, "label": 1, "return": 0.0035894814516553492, "excess_return": 0.1261870145829506, "count_of_word": 1154, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.46359274, "prof1": 0.53640723, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4793840942963376, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5206159057036625, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.46359274, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.53640723, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.57702255, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.42297745, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.491683, "tr_prof1": 0.50831705, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.6204903, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.37950978, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5079417, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.49205825, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.4605795999999999, "headline_prof21": 0.5394204, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.49465552, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5053445, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.40891, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.59109, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.28929517, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.71070486, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 0.12977649603460595, "returnpredvader": -0.12977649603460595, "returnpredsgd": 0.12977649603460595, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0045273317056116, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0085094941598218, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0086022200672622, "cumreturn1b": 1.3404606583702339, "cumreturn1d": 1.1437766145090253, "cumreturn1e": 1.249480046147408, "cumreturndow": 1.1216758000786449, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1015675620670913}, {"Unnamed: 0": 4346, "Unnamed: 0.1": 4346, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 4346, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 4346, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 4346, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 4346, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 4346, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 4346, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 4346, "level_0": 4346, "index": 4346, "text": "MARCH 28 (REUTERS) - U.S. AUTO PARTS MAKER WABCO HOLDINGS INC ON THURSDAY CONFIRMED IT WOULD SELL ITSELF TO GERMAN RIVAL ZF FRIEDRICHSHAFEN FOR OVER $7 BILLION.

REUTERS/TIKSA NEGERI/FILE PHOTO  INVESTIGATORS LOOKING TO UNCOVER THE CAUSES MUST ANSWER ONE OF THE BIGGEST QUESTIONS: WAS THE PLANE\u2019S SOFTWARE TO BLAME?  WHAT WE KNOW     BOEING HAS STOPPED DELIVERY OF ALL NEW MAX JETS. ITS STOCK HAS FALLEN 7.5 PERCENT SINCE THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH.     BOEING MAINTAINS ITS NEW, FUEL-EFFICIENT JETS ARE SAFE, BUT SUPPORTED THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) DECISION TO GROUND THEM.     EUROPE AND CANADA SAID THEY WOULD INDEPENDENTLY CERTIFY THE SAFETY OF THE JETS, FURTHER COMPLICATING PLANS TO GET THE AIRCRAFT BACK FLYING.     BOEING WILL MANDATE ON MAX JETS A PREVIOUSLY OPTIONAL COCKPIT WARNING LIGHT, WHICH MIGHT HAVE WARNED OF PROBLEMS THAT POSSIBLY PLAYED A ROLE IN THE ETHIOPIAN AND INDONESIAN CRASHES, SOURCES SAID ON MARCH 21.     INDONESIA\u2019S FLAG CARRIER GARUDA SAID ON MARCH 22 IT HAD SENT A LETTER TO BOEING ASKING TO CANCEL AN ORDER FOR 49 MAX 8 AIRCRAFT, BECOMING THE FIRST AIRLINE TO CONFIRM PLANS TO CANCEL AN ORDER AFTER THE CRASHES.     INVESTIGATORS HAVE FOUND SIMILARITIES IN THE \u2018ANGLE OF ATTACK\u2019 DATA FROM BOTH FLIGHTS. A PIECE OF A STABILIZER IN THE WRECKAGE OF THE ETHIOPIAN JET WITH THE TRIM SET IN AN UNUSUAL POSITION WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE LION AIR PLANE, SOURCES SAID.     EXPERTS BELIEVE A NEW FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM, MCAS, ON THE JETS, DESIGNED TO STOP STALLING BY DIPPING THE NOSE, MAY HAVE BEEN A FACTOR IN BOTH CRASHES, WITH PILOTS UNABLE TO OVERRIDE IT AS THEIR JETS PLUNGED AFTER A FAULTY SENSOR INDICATED A STALL. BUT NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE YET LINKS THE TWO ACCIDENTS.     THE MCAS SYSTEM ON THE ETHIOPIAN FLIGHT RE-ENGAGED AS MANY AS FOUR TIMES AFTER THE CREW INITIALLY TURNED IT OFF, TWO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER TOLD REUTERS ON APRIL 3.     THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTED ON APRIL 3 THAT THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES PILOTS HAD INITIALLY FOLLOWED BOEING\u2019S EMERGENCY PROCEDURES BUT LATER DEVIATED FROM THEM AS THEY TRIED TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE PLANE.     BOEING\u2019S COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DIVISION HAS BROUGHT IN A NEW VICE PRESIDENT OF ENGINEERING WHILE DEDICATING ANOTHER TOP EXECUTIVE TO THE AIRCRAFT INVESTIGATIONS, A COMPANY EMAIL SHOWED.  WHAT\u2019S NEXT?     ETHIOPIA IS DUE TO PUBLISH THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF AN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION WITHIN DAYS.     INDONESIA HAS ADVANCED THE PLANNED RELEASE OF ITS REPORT ON THE LION AIR CRASH TO BETWEEN JULY AND AUGUST, VERSUS A PREVIOUS SCHEDULE OF BETWEEN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER.     U.S. LAWMAKERS SAID THE 737 MAX COULD BE GROUNDED FOR WEEKS TO UPGRADE SOFTWARE IN EVERY PLANE. OTHER COUNTRIES MAY GROUND THE PLANES EVEN LONGER.     THE U.S. TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT\u2019S INSPECTOR GENERAL PLANS TO AUDIT THE FAA\u2019S CERTIFICATION OF THE JET, AN OFFICIAL WITH THE OFFICE SAID ON MARCH 19. THE OFFICE CAN RECOMMEND CHANGES OR IMPROVEMENTS TO HOW THE FAA OPERATES.     THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO LOOKING AT THE FAA\u2019S OVERSIGHT OF BOEING, A PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER HAS SAID.

THE CHAIRMAN OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND ANOTHER KEY DEMOCRAT ASKED THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT\u2019S INSPECTOR GENERAL TO EXAMINE KEY DECISIONS THE FAA MADE IN CERTIFYING THE MAX JET.

REUTERS/CHARLES PLATIAU  LONDON (REUTERS BREAKINGVIEWS) - DEUTSCHE BANK\u2019S LATEST STRATEGY FOR BOOSTING ITS APPEAL MAY BE ITS MOST EFFECTIVE YET: THE GERMAN LENDER HEADED BY CHRISTIAN SEWING HAS BANNED STAFF FROM DORCHESTER COLLECTION HOTELS AFTER ITS OWNER, THE GOVERNMENT OF BRUNEI, IMPLEMENTED HOMOPHOBIC LAWS. SHAREHOLDERS WILL WELCOME THE FACT THAT EMPLOYEES OF A BANK WHOSE COSTS ATE UP 93 PERCENT OF REVENUE LAST YEAR WILL NO LONGER FREQUENT A CHAIN WHICH CHARGES NEARLY 400 POUNDS A NIGHT FOR A STANDARD ROOM IN LONDON. HOWEVER, THE DECISION RAISES THE MORAL BAR.  BRUNEI\u2019S STATE-OWNED INVESTMENT AGENCY OWNS THE DORCHESTER COLLECTION HOTEL GROUP, WHICH INCLUDES LUXURY VENUES SUCH AS THE BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL AND HOTEL BEL-AIR IN LOS ANGELES. OSCAR-WINNING ACTOR GEORGE CLOONEY CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT AFTER THE GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTED ISLAMIC LAWS WHICH WOULD IMPOSE THE DEATH PENALTY FOR HOMOSEXUALITY OR ADULTERY. CELEBRITIES INCLUDING SINGER ELTON JOHN HAVE JOINED IN.  SHUNNING THE SULTANATE IS RELATIVELY PAINLESS FOR DEUTSCHE, WHICH HAS LIMITED BUSINESS IN BRUNEI. YET LIKE MANY OF ITS GLOBAL PEERS THE BANK CONTINUES TO OPERATE IN SAUDI ARABIA, WHICH ALSO HAS STRINGENT ANTI-HOMOSEXUALITY LAWS. GOLDMAN SACHS CEO DAVID SOLOMON RECENTLY MET GOVERNMENT-LINKED CLIENTS IN THE DESERT KINGDOM.  BANKS AND OTHER BIG MULTINATIONALS LONG ARGUED THAT THEY HAD TO ACCEPT THE LAWS OF COUNTRIES WHERE THEY DO BUSINESS. BUT PRESSURE FROM CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS IS FORCING THEM TO SET OUT MORAL POSITIONS. EMPLOYERS\u2019 EFFORTS TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A DIVERSE WORKFORCE IN THE WEST IS ALSO INCREASINGLY HARD TO SQUARE WITH MAINTAINING LINKS WITH REPRESSIVE REGIMES.  BIG COMPANIES GENERALLY MUSTER TWO DEFENCES. THE FIRST IS THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, A BOYCOTT WOULD BE COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE. THIS IS HOW COMPANIES JUSTIFIED THEIR PRESENCE IN SAUDI ARABIA \u2013 WHICH RECENTLY ALLOWED WOMEN TO DRIVE \u2013 AT LEAST UNTIL THE BRUTAL MURDER OF JOURNALIST JAMAL KHASHOGGI BY SAUDI AGENTS LAST YEAR. THE SECOND DEFENCE IS THAT COMPANIES HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS TO WEIGH THE COSTS OF BOYCOTTING CERTAIN COUNTRIES AGAINST THE REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE OF WORKING WITH THEM.  INCREASED INVESTOR DEMAND FOR COMPANIES TO MEET A RANGE OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA MEANS BANKS ESPECIALLY WILL FACE MORE AWKWARD QUESTIONS ABOUT BUSINESS IN ILLIBERAL COUNTRIES. SO WHILE DEUTSCHE\u2019S BRUNEI BOYCOTT MAY BE RELATIVELY COST-FREE, IT WILL FACE BIGGER FINANCIAL TESTS IN THE FUTURE.", "Ticker": "DB", "Date": "2019-04-05T00:00:00", "key": "20190405DB", "labelr0": -1.7647058823529451, "labelr1": -0.35928143712574084, "labelr2": -0.9615384615384625, "labelr3": -0.3640776699029049, "labelr4": 2.1924482338611413, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.28600000000000003, "compound": -0.5574, "0_day_return": -1.764705882352946, "1_day_return": -1.764705882352946, "2_day_return": -1.3173652694610571, "3_day_return": -1.676646706586804, "4_day_return": 0.4790419161676773, "label": -1, "return": 0.00104746019707077, "excess_return": -1.7657533425500167, "count_of_word": 403, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5223258, "prof1": 0.4776742, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5352209962070591, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4647790037929409, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5223258, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.4776742, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.41841668, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.5815833, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.45513648, "tr_prof1": 0.54486346, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.40975457, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.5902455, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.66268986, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.33731009999999995, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.6863019, "headline_prof21": 0.31369817, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.29829064, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.7017094, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.6493423, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.35065767, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.836269, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.163731, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -1.764705882352946, "returnpredvader": 1.764705882352946, "returnpredsgd": 1.764705882352946, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0043545028772216, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0010131637276665, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.006831202608154, "cumreturn1b": 1.383532498797178, "cumreturn1d": 1.1368916090511132, "cumreturn1e": 1.278625973713759, "cumreturndow": 1.153679432733193, "cumreturnsp500": 1.128276727515149}, {"Unnamed: 0": 4833, "Unnamed: 0.1": 4833, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 4833, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 4833, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 4833, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 4833, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 4833, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 4833, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 4833, "level_0": 4833, "index": 4833, "text": "(CORRECTS NASDAQ\u2019S OPENING FIGURES)  APRIL 8 (REUTERS) - U.S. STOCKS OPENED LOWER ON MONDAY, PAUSING AFTER THE S&P 500\u2019S SEVEN-DAY WINNING STREAK, AS INVESTORS BRACED FOR WHAT COULD BE THE FIRST DECLINE IN CORPORATE EARNINGS SINCE 2016 AND A DROP IN BOEING CO\u2019S SHARES HIT THE DOW INDUSTRIALS.

IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, THE GOVERNMENT GRANTED PETROBRAS THE RIGHTS TO EXTRACT 5 BILLION BARRELS OF OIL IN THE TOR AREA IN RETURN FOR NEW SHARES WORTH 74.8 BILLION REAIS, OR ABOUT $42.5 BILLION AT THE TIME.  THE GOVERNMENT ALSO SET ASIDE A \u201cCONTINGENCY AREA\u201d OF ABOUT 1,000 SQUARE KM (390 SQUARE MILES) IN CASE THE ORIGINAL AREA PROVED INSUFFICIENT.  WHY THE DISPUTE?  THE TOR ARRANGEMENT PROVIDED FOR PETROBRAS AND THE GOVERNMENT TO REVISE SOME TERMS IN THE CONTRACT WHEN FIELDS WERE DECLARED COMMERCIALLY VIABLE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SHIFTS IN OIL PRICES, PRODUCTION COSTS AND OTHER VARIABLES.  PETROBRAS BEGAN DECLARING TOR FIELDS COMMERCIALLY VIABLE IN 2013, STARTING WITH THE BUZIOS FIELD, AND HAS BEEN HAGGLING OVER CONTRACT REVISIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT EVER SINCE, AS OIL PRICES SWUNG SHARPLY AND STUDIES SHOWED LARGER RESERVES IN THE AREA.  BRAZILIAN OIL REGULATOR ANP NOW BELIEVES THERE ARE SOME 6 BILLION TO 15 BILLION BARRELS OF OIL IN THE TOR AREA, IN ADDITION TO THE ORIGINAL 5 BILLION BARRELS GRANTED TO PETROBRAS.  BRAZIL\u2019S CASH-STRAPPED GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO OFFER THAT ADDITIONAL OIL AT AUCTION BECAUSE IT HAD NOT COME TO TERMS WITH PETROBRAS ON THE REVISED TOR CONTRACT.  UNTIL RECENT MONTHS, THE TWO SIDES SEEMED FAR APART. BUT SINCE NEW PRESIDENT JAIR BOLSONARO APPOINTED A NEW PETROBRAS CHIEF EXECUTIVE IN JANUARY, TALKS SEEM TO HAVE PICKED UP PACE, CULMINATING IN THE MORE THAN $9 BILLION AGREEMENT.  WHAT IS NEXT?  THE GOVERNMENT HAS SCHEDULED FOR OCT. 28 AN AUCTION FOR THE RIGHTS TO EXTRACT THE EXCESS OIL IN THE TOR AREA, DIVIDED INTO FOUR SEPARATE FIELDS CALLED ATAPU, BUZIOS, ITAPU E SEPIA.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE AUCTION COULD RAISE SOME 100 BILLION REAIS ($26 BILLION) OR MORE.  PETROBRAS AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE STILL DISCUSSING HOW THE AUCTION WINNERS WILL POTENTIALLY PARTNER WITH THE STATE OIL COMPANY, WHICH IS ALREADY PRODUCING AT BUZIOS AND HAS THE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL TO REMAIN OPERATOR AT THE FOUR FIELDS.  REGARDLESS OF THE FINAL ARRANGEMENT, WINNERS OF THE AUCTION WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMPENSATE PETROBRAS FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPLORATORY WORK IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ALREADY INVESTED.  WHILE THE EXACT VALUE OF THAT COMPENSATION HAS NOT BEEN SETTLED, REUTERS REPORTED LATE LAST YEAR THAT THE COMPENSATION, WHICH IS SEPARATE FROM THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PAYMENT, IS LIKELY TO BE AT LEAST 30 BILLION REAIS ($7.9 BILLION).  WHO IS INTERESTED?  THE OCTOBER AUCTION IS EXPECTED TO ATTRACT A RANGE OF MAJOR GLOBAL OIL COMPANIES, WHICH HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THE OPPORTUNITY WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN RECENT MONTHS.  NOT LEAST AMONG THE INTERESTED PARTIES IS PETROBRAS ITSELF. WHILE THE FIRM IS AGGRESSIVELY CUTTING DEBT, CEO CASTELLO BRANCO HAS SAID THE $9 BILLION PAYMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE USED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE AUCTION.  AMONG THE COMPANIES WITH EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ASSETS ADJACENT OR RELATIVELY CLOSE TO THE TOR AREA, OFFERING POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS, ARE TOTAL SA, ROYAL DUTCH SHELL PLC, AND CHINA\u2019S CNOOC LTD AND CNPC.  HOWEVER, THEY MAY NEED TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR POLITICAL INTERFERENCE OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.  HOUSE SPEAKER RODRIGO MAIA HAS ARGUED THAT CONGRESS MUST APPROVE THE ACCORD BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND PETROBRAS BEFORE THE AUCTION CAN TAKE PLACE. OTHERS, INCLUDING FINANCE MINISTER PAULO GUEDES, DISPUTE THE NEED FOR CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL.", "Ticker": "PBR", "Date": "2019-04-10T00:00:00", "key": "20190410PBR", "labelr0": 0.6516587677725085, "labelr1": -3.0606238964096506, "labelr2": -9.289617486338797, "labelr3": 0.5354752342704155, "labelr4": 2.3302263648468684, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.0, "0_day_return": 0.6516587677725116, "1_day_return": -3.0606238964096533, "2_day_return": -12.065921130076518, "3_day_return": -11.595055915244256, "4_day_return": -9.53502060035314, "label": -1, "return": 3.812292093953168e-05, "excess_return": -3.0606620193305933, "count_of_word": 727, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.48524275, "prof1": 0.5147572, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4787258440436857, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5212741559563143, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.48524275, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.5147572, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.31644714, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.68355286, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.45101514, "tr_prof1": 0.5489848, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.38495043, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.61504954, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5131505999999999, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.48684943, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.519159, "headline_prof21": 0.48084098, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.30667233, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.6933276999999999, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.4542057, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.5457943000000001, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.65079224, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.3492078, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -3.0606238964096533, "returnpredvader": 3.0606238964096533, "returnpredsgd": -3.0606238964096533, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0015523650653617, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0026089003852354, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.000827064109848, "cumreturn1b": 1.3874024473190176, "cumreturn1d": 1.1453128510047743, "cumreturn1e": 1.2819283692659489, "cumreturndow": 1.1507113598759262, "cumreturnsp500": 1.119797043077066}, {"Unnamed: 0": 5023, "Unnamed: 0.1": 5023, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 5023, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 5023, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 5023, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 5023, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 5023, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 5023, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 5023, "level_0": 5023, "index": 5023, "text": "FILE PHOTO: AN AERIAL VIEW SHOWS THE BRINE POOLS OF SQM LITHIUM MINE ON THE ATACAMA SALT FLAT IN THE ATACAMA DESERT OF NORTHERN CHILE, JANUARY 10, 2013.

MASS-MARKET LABELS LIKE NIVEA HAVE STRUGGLED IN RECENT YEARS AMID THE RISE OF SMALL, DISRUPTIVE BRANDS LIKE CANADA\u2019S THE ORDINARY, AND AS CONSUMERS FAVORED MORE NATURAL INGREDIENTS AND PREMIUM PRODUCTS.  THAT HAS PROMPTED BEIERSDORF TO PUSH PRICIER BRANDS LIKE LA PRAIRIE AND EUCERIN, AND TO LAUNCH MORE EXPENSIVE PRODUCTS UNDER THE NIVEA LABEL, LIKE ITS ANTI-AGEING CELLULAR RANGE.  SHARES IN BEIERSDORF WERE HIT IN FEBRUARY AFTER NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE STEFAN DE LOECKER WARNED THAT THE GROUP\u2019S OPERATING MARGIN WOULD FALL IN 2019 AS IT INVESTS TO RESPOND TO SMALLER DISRUPTIVE BRANDS.

HSBC WAS THE BIGGEST SUPPORT TO THE MAIN BOURSE, RISING 2 PERCENT TO ITS HIGHEST LEVEL IN OVER EIGHT MONTHS AS ITS PROFIT SURPASSED ANALYSTS\u2019 EXPECTATIONS THANKS TO A SURGE IN INCOME FROM ITS CORE ASIAN BUSINESS.

THE WORKERS CATEGORIZE ITEMS ACCORDING TO FIVE \u201cDIMENSIONS,\u201d AS FACEBOOK CALLS THEM.  THESE INCLUDE THE SUBJECT OF THE POST - IS IT FOOD, FOR EXAMPLE, OR A SELFIE OR AN ANIMAL? WHAT IS THE OCCASION - AN EVERYDAY ACTIVITY OR MAJOR LIFE EVENT? AND WHAT IS THE AUTHOR\u2019S INTENTION - TO PLAN AN EVENT, TO INSPIRE, TO MAKE A JOKE?  THE WORK IS AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING HOW THE TYPES OF THINGS USERS POST ON ITS SERVICES ARE CHANGING, FACEBOOK SAID. THAT CAN HELP THE COMPANY DEVELOP NEW FEATURES, POTENTIALLY INCREASING USAGE AND AD REVENUE.  DETAILS OF THE EFFORT WERE PROVIDED BY MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES AT OUTSOURCING FIRM WIPRO LTD OVER SEVERAL MONTHS. THE WORKERS SPOKE ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY DUE TO FEAR OF RETALIATION BY THE INDIAN FIRM. FACEBOOK LATER CONFIRMED MANY DETAILS OF THE PROJECT. WIPRO DECLINED TO COMMENT AND REFERRED ALL QUESTIONS TO FACEBOOK.  THE WIPRO WORK IS AMONG ABOUT 200 CONTENT LABELING PROJECTS THAT FACEBOOK HAS AT ANY TIME, EMPLOYING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE GLOBALLY, COMPANY OFFICIALS TOLD REUTERS. MANY PROJECTS ARE AIMED AT \u201cTRAINING\u201d THE SOFTWARE THAT DETERMINES WHAT APPEARS IN USERS\u2019 NEWS FEEDS AND POWERS THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE UNDERLYING MANY OTHER FEATURES.  THE LABELING EFFORTS HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN REPORTED.  \u201cIT\u2019S A CORE PART OF WHAT YOU NEED,\u201d SAID NIPUN MATHUR, THE DIRECTOR OF PRODUCT MANAGEMENT FOR AI AT FACEBOOK. \u201cI DON\u2019T SEE THE NEED GOING AWAY.\u201d  THE CONTENT LABELING PROGRAM COULD RAISE NEW PRIVACY ISSUES FOR FACEBOOK, ACCORDING TO LEGAL EXPERTS CONSULTED BY REUTERS. THE COMPANY IS FACING REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS WORLDWIDE OVER AN UNRELATED SET OF ALLEGED PRIVACY ABUSES INVOLVING THE SHARING OF USER DATA WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS.  THE WIPRO WORKERS SAID THEY GAIN A WINDOW INTO LIVES AS THEY VIEW A VACATION PHOTO OR A POST MEMORIALIZING A DECEASED FAMILY MEMBER. FACEBOOK ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SOME POSTS, INCLUDING SCREENSHOTS AND THOSE WITH COMMENTS, MAY INCLUDE USER NAMES.  THE COMPANY SAID ITS LEGAL AND PRIVACY TEAMS MUST SIGN OFF ON ALL LABELING EFFORTS, ADDING THAT IT RECENTLY INTRODUCED AN AUDITING SYSTEM \u201cTO ENSURE THAT PRIVACY EXPECTATIONS ARE BEING FOLLOWED AND PARAMETERS IN PLACE ARE WORKING AS EXPECTED.\u201d  BUT ONE FORMER FACEBOOK PRIVACY MANAGER, SPEAKING ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY, EXPRESSED UNEASE ABOUT USERS\u2019 POSTS BEING SCRUTINIZED WITHOUT THEIR EXPLICIT PERMISSION. THE EUROPEAN UNION\u2019S YEAR-OLD GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR) HAS STRICT RULES ABOUT HOW COMPANIES GATHER AND USE PERSONAL DATA AND IN MANY CASES REQUIRES SPECIFIC CONSENT.  \u201cONE OF THE KEY PIECES OF GDPR IS PURPOSE LIMITATION,\u201d SAID JOHN KENNEDY, A PARTNER AT LAW FIRM WIGGIN AND DANA WHO HAS WORKED ON OUTSOURCING, PRIVACY AND AI.  IF THE PURPOSE IS LOOKING AT POSTS TO IMPROVE THE PRECISION OF SERVICES, THAT SHOULD BE STATED EXPLICITLY, KENNEDY SAID. USING AN OUTSIDE VENDOR FOR THE WORK COULD ALSO REQUIRE CONSENT, HE SAID.  IT REMAINS UNCLEAR EXACTLY HOW GDPR WILL BE INTERPRETED AND WHETHER REGULATORS AND CONSUMERS WOULD SEE FACEBOOK\u2019S INTERNAL LABELING PRACTICES AS PROBLEMATIC. EUROPE\u2019S TOP DATA PRIVACY OFFICIAL DECLINED TO COMMENT ON POSSIBLE CONCERNS.  A FACEBOOK SPOKESWOMAN SAID: \u201cWE MAKE IT CLEAR IN OUR DATA POLICY THAT WE USE THE INFORMATION PEOPLE PROVIDE TO FACEBOOK TO IMPROVE THEIR EXPERIENCE AND THAT WE MIGHT WORK WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS TO HELP IN THIS PROCESS.\u201d  U.S. SENATOR MARK WARNER, A DEMOCRAT AND LEADING CRITIC OF SOCIAL MEDIA, TOLD REUTERS IN A STATEMENT THAT LARGE PLATFORMS INCREASINGLY ARE \u201cTAKING MORE AND MORE DATA FROM USERS, FOR WIDER AND MORE FAR-REACHING USES, WITHOUT ANY CORRESPONDING COMPENSATION TO THE USER.\u201d  WARNER SAID HE IS DRAFTING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE FACEBOOK TO \u201cDISCLOSE THE VALUE OF USERS\u2019 DATA, AND TELL USERS EXACTLY HOW THEIR DATA IS BEING MONETIZED.\u201d  THE PROJECT  HUMAN-POWERED CONTENT LABELING, ALSO REFERRED TO AS \u201cDATA ANNOTATION,\u201d IS A GROWTH INDUSTRY AS COMPANIES SEEK TO HARNESS DATA FOR AI TRAINING AND OTHER PURPOSES.  SELF-DRIVING CAR COMPANIES SUCH AS ALPHABET INC\u2019S WAYMO HAVE LABELERS IDENTIFY TRAFFIC LIGHTS AND PEDESTRIANS IN VIDEOS TO FORTIFY THEIR AI. VOICE ASSISTANT DEVELOPERS INCLUDING AMAZON.COM INC HAVE PEOPLE ANNOTATE CUSTOMER AUDIO TO IMPROVE AI\u2019S ABILITY TO DECIPHER SPEECH.  FACEBOOK LAUNCHED THE WIPRO PROJECT IN APRIL LAST YEAR. THE INDIAN FIRM RECEIVED A $4 MILLION CONTRACT AND FORMED A TEAM OF ABOUT 260 LABELERS, ACCORDING TO THE WORKERS. LAST YEAR, THE WORK CONSISTED OF ANALYZING POSTS FROM THE PRIOR FIVE YEARS.  AFTER COMPLETING THAT, THE TEAM IN DECEMBER WAS CUT TO ABOUT 30 AND SHIFTED TO LABELING EACH MONTH POSTS FROM THE PRIOR MONTH. WORK IS EXPECTED TO LAST THROUGH AT LEAST THE END OF 2019, THEY SAID.  FACEBOOK CONFIRMED THE STAFFING CHANGES BUT DECLINED TO COMMENT ON FINANCIAL DETAILS.  THE COMPANY SAID ITS ANALYSIS IS ONGOING SO IT COULD NOT PROVIDE ANY FINDINGS FROM THE LABELING OR RESULTING PRODUCT DECISIONS. IT HAS NOT TOLD LABELERS THE PURPOSE OR RESULTS OF THE PROJECT, AND THE WORKERS SAID ALL THEY HAVE INFERRED FROM THEIR LIMITED VIEW IS THAT SELFIES ARE INCREASINGLY POPULAR.  THE WIPRO LABELERS AND FACEBOOK SAID THE POSTS ARE A RANDOM SAMPLING OF TEXT-BASED STATUS UPDATES, SHARED LINKS, EVENT POSTS, STORIES FEATURE UPLOADS, VIDEOS AND PHOTOS, INCLUDING USER-POSTED SCREENSHOTS OF CHATS ON FACEBOOK\u2019S VARIOUS MESSAGING APPS. THE POSTS COME FROM FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM USERS GLOBALLY, IN LANGUAGES INCLUDING ENGLISH, HINDI AND ARABIC.  EACH ITEM GOES TO TWO LABELERS TO CHECK ACCURACY, AND A THIRD IF THEY DISAGREE, FACEBOOK SAID. WORKERS SAID THEY SEE ON AVERAGE 700 ITEMS PER DAY. FACEBOOK SAID THE TARGET AVERAGE IS LOWER.  FACEBOOK CONFIRMED LABELERS IN TIMISOARA, ROMANIA AND MANILA, THE PHILIPPINES ARE INVOLVED IN THE SAME PROJECT.  AMONG FACEBOOK\u2019S OTHER LABELING PROJECTS, ONE WORKER IN HYDERABAD FOR OUTSOURCING VENDOR COGNIZANT TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS CORP SAID HE AND AT LEAST 500 COLLEAGUES LOOK FOR SENSITIVE TOPICS OR PROFANE LANGUAGE IN FACEBOOK VIDEOS.  THE AIM IS TO TRAIN AN AUTOMATED FACEBOOK TOOL THAT ENABLES ADVERTISERS TO AVOID SPONSORING VIDEOS THAT ARE, FOR EXAMPLE, ADULT OR POLITICAL, FACEBOOK SAID. COGNIZANT DID NOT RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT.  ANOTHER APPLICATION OF LABELING INVOLVED THE SOCIAL NETWORK\u2019S MARKETPLACE SHOPPING FEATURE, WHERE IT AUTOMATED CATEGORY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW LISTINGS BY FIRST HAVING LABELERS AND PRODUCT EXPERTS CATEGORIZE SOME EXISTING LISTINGS, FACEBOOK\u2019S MATHUR SAID.  PRIVATE POSTS  FACEBOOK USERS ARE NOT OFFERED THE CHANCE TO OPT OUT OF THEIR DATA BEING LABELED.  AT WIPRO, THE POSTS BEING EXAMINED INCLUDE NOT ONLY PUBLIC POSTS BUT ALSO THOSE THAT ARE SHARED PRIVATELY TO A LIMITED SET OF A USER\u2019S FRIENDS. THAT ENSURES THE SAMPLE REFLECTS THE RANGE OF ACTIVITY ON FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM, SAID KAREN COURINGTON, DIRECTOR OF PRODUCT SUPPORT OPERATIONS AT FACEBOOK.  FACEBOOK\u2019S DATA POLICY DOES NOT EXPLICITLY MENTION MANUAL ANALYSIS.  \u201cWE PROVIDE INFORMATION AND CONTENT TO VENDORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS, SUCH AS BY PROVIDING TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES, ANALYZING HOW OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED, PROVIDING CUSTOMER SERVICE, FACILITATING PAYMENTS OR CONDUCTING SURVEYS,\u201d THE POLICY STATES.  EUROPE\u2019S GDPR ALSO REQUIRES COMPANIES DELETE USER DATA UPON REQUEST. FACEBOOK SAID IT HAS TECHNOLOGY TO ROUTINELY SYNC LABELED POSTS WITH BOTH DELETION REQUESTS AND CHANGES TO CONTENT PRIVACY SETTINGS.  FACEBOOK AND OTHER COMPANIES ARE TESTING TECHNIQUES TO CURTAIL THE NEED FOR OUTSOURCED LABELING, IN PART TO ANALYZE MORE DATA FASTER AND CHEAPER. FOR INSTANCE, AI TRAINING DATA FOR NEWS FEED RANKINGS AND PHOTO DESCRIPTIONS FOR THE BLIND CAME FROM HASHTAGS ON INSTAGRAM POSTS, FACEBOOK\u2019S MATHUR SAID.  \u201cWE TRY TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF THINGS WE SEND OUT,\u201d HE SAID.", "Ticker": "WIT", "Date": "2019-05-06T00:00:00", "key": "20190506WIT", "labelr0": 1.8140589569161008, "labelr1": -0.8908685968819607, "labelr2": 2.2471910112359472, "labelr3": -1.098901098901095, "labelr4": 0.2222222222222175, "pos": 0.314, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.4939, "0_day_return": 1.8140589569161087, "1_day_return": 1.8140589569161087, "2_day_return": 1.336302895322916, "3_day_return": 0.22271714922046384, "4_day_return": 0.4454342984409497, "label": 1, "return": -0.01651165143337798, "excess_return": 1.8305706083494881, "count_of_word": 1293, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.49444455, "prof1": 0.50555545, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5336577584840321, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4663422415159679, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.49444455, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.50555545, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.58974487, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.41025516, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.46858016, "tr_prof1": 0.5314199000000001, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.59497464, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.40502533, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5250026, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.4749974, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.67028266, "headline_prof21": 0.32971737, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.37786725, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.6221328, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.64189094, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.35810906, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.72549456, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.2745054, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": 1.8140589569161087, "returnpredvader": 1.8140589569161087, "returnpredsgd": -1.8140589569161087, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0164402280128308, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0246819461242107, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0069453787798828, "cumreturn1b": 1.7116329272745898, "cumreturn1d": 1.2998912766986888, "cumreturn1e": 1.3489736486036021, "cumreturndow": 1.1490101774395944, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1121743622849434}, {"Unnamed: 0": 6335, "Unnamed: 0.1": 6335, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 6335, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 6335, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 6335, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 6335, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6335, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6335, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6335, "level_0": 6335, "index": 6335, "text": "MAY 7 (REUTERS) - BELOW ARE COMPANY-RELATED NEWS AND STORIES FROM FRENCH AND BENELUX MEDIA WHICH COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE REGION\u2019S MARKETS OR INDIVIDUAL STOCKS.

FACEBOOK HAS BEEN UNDER SCRUTINY FROM REGULATORS AROUND THE WORLD OVER DATA SHARING PRACTICES AS WELL AS HATE SPEECH AND MISINFORMATION ON ITS NETWORKS. SOME U.S. LAWMAKERS HAVE PUSHED FOR ACTION TO BREAK UP BIG TECH COMPANIES AS WELL AS FEDERAL PRIVACY REGULATION.  \u201cWE ARE A NATION WITH A TRADITION OF REINING IN MONOPOLIES, NO MATTER HOW WELL INTENTIONED THE LEADERS OF THESE COMPANIES MAY BE. MARK\u2019S POWER IS UNPRECEDENTED AND UN-AMERICAN,\u201d HUGHES, A FORMER COLLEGE ROOMMATE OF FACEBOOK CHIEF EXECUTIVE MARK ZUCKERBERG, WROTE IN A LENGTHY NEW YORK TIMES OPINION PIECE.  FACEBOOK\u2019S SOCIAL NETWORK HAS MORE THAN 2 BILLION USERS. IT ALSO OWNS WHATSAPP, MESSENGER AND INSTAGRAM, EACH USED BY MORE THAN 1 BILLION PEOPLE. FACEBOOK BOUGHT INSTAGRAM IN 2012 AND WHATSAPP IN 2014.  FACEBOOK REJECTED HUGHES\u2019 CALL FOR WHATSAPP AND INSTAGRAM TO BE MADE INTO SEPARATE COMPANIES, AND SAID THE FOCUS SHOULD INSTEAD BE ON REGULATING THE INTERNET. ZUCKERBERG WILL BE IN PARIS ON FRIDAY TO DISCUSS INTERNET REGULATION WITH FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON.  \u201cFACEBOOK ACCEPTS THAT WITH SUCCESS COMES ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT YOU DON\u2019T ENFORCE ACCOUNTABILITY BY CALLING FOR THE BREAK UP OF A SUCCESSFUL AMERICAN COMPANY,\u201d FACEBOOK SPOKESMAN NICK CLEGG SAID IN A STATEMENT.  \u201cACCOUNTABILITY OF TECH COMPANIES CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE PAINSTAKING INTRODUCTION OF NEW RULES FOR THE INTERNET. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT MARK ZUCKERBERG HAS CALLED FOR.\u201d  LATE ON THURSDAY, SENATOR MIKE CRAPO, THE REPUBLICAN WHO CHAIRS THE BANKING COMMITTEE AND SHERROD BROWN, THE TOP DEMOCRAT, ASKED FACEBOOK TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT A POTENTIAL CRYPTOCURRENCY-BASED PAYMENTS SYSTEM USING ITS SOCIAL NETWORK AND ITS DATA COLLECTION.  THE LETTER ALSO ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT CONSUMER PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND IF IT HAD INFORMATION ABOUT USERS\u2019 CREDITWORTHINESS.  U.S. SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, A DEMOCRAT, TOLD CNBC HE THINKS FACEBOOK SHOULD BE BROKEN UP AND THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT\u2019S ANTITRUST DIVISION NEEDS TO BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION.  ANTITRUST LAW MAKES SUCH A PROPOSAL TOUGH TO EXECUTE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE COMPANY TO COURT AND WIN. IT IS RARE TO BREAK UP A COMPANY BUT NOT UNHEARD OF, WITH STANDARD OIL AND AT&T BEING THE TWO BIGGEST EXAMPLES.  SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY  HUGHES CO-FOUNDED FACEBOOK IN 2004 AT HARVARD WITH ZUCKERBERG AND DUSTIN MOSKOVITZ. HE LEFT FACEBOOK IN 2007, AND HAS SAID IN A LINKEDIN POST HE MADE HALF A BILLION DOLLARS FOR HIS THREE YEARS OF WORK.  \u201cIT\u2019S BEEN 15 YEARS SINCE I CO-FOUNDED FACEBOOK AT HARVARD, AND I HAVEN\u2019T WORKED AT THE COMPANY IN A DECADE. BUT I FEEL A SENSE OF ANGER AND RESPONSIBILITY,\u201d HUGHES SAID.  FACEBOOK LOST SEVERAL EXECUTIVES AFTER A BRUISING SERIES OF PRIVACY AND DISINFORMATION SCANDALS SINCE 2016. THE FOUNDERS OF INSTAGRAM AND WHATSAPP HAVE LEFT, AS HAS THE EXECUTIVE WHO TOOK OVER WHATSAPP LAST YEAR.  CHIEF PRODUCT OFFICER CHRIS COX, WHO HAD BEEN AT THE COMPANY FOR 13 YEARS AND WAS ONE OF ZUCKERBERG\u2019S CLOSEST LIEUTENANTS, STEPPED DOWN IN MARCH AROUND THE SAME TIME FACEBOOK ANNOUNCED A PIVOT TOWARD MORE PRIVATE MESSAGING.  HE LATER CITED \u201cARTISTIC DIFFERENCES\u201d WITH ZUCKERBERG AS HIS REASON FOR LEAVING, WITHOUT ELABORATING.  CRITICS SAY THE COMPANY\u2019S PIVOT TO PRIVACY, WHICH WILL INTRODUCE MORE ENCRYPTED COMMUNICATIONS, WILL RESTRICT FACEBOOK\u2019S ABILITY TO POLICE PROPAGANDA, HATE SPEECH AND OTHER ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR. COX FOCUSED ON IMPROVING TOOLS TO CATCH BANNED CONTENT IN RECENT YEARS.  DESPITE ITS SCANDALS, THE COMPANY\u2019S CORE BUSINESS HAS PROVEN RESILIENT. FACEBOOK HAS BLOWN PAST EARNINGS ESTIMATES IN THE PAST TWO QUARTERS AND ITS STOCK PRICE BARELY BUDGED IN RESPONSE TO HUGHES\u2019 OPINION PIECE.  HUGHES SUGGESTED ZUCKERBERG SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR PRIVACY AND OTHER LAPSES AT THE COMPANY, ECHOING A CALL EARLIER THIS MONTH BY DEMOCRATIC U.S. SENATOR RON WYDEN TO HOLD THE CEO INDIVIDUALLY LIABLE FOR \u201cREPEATED VIOLATIONS\u201d OF PRIVACY.  \u201cTHE GOVERNMENT MUST HOLD MARK ACCOUNTABLE. FOR TOO LONG, LAWMAKERS HAVE MARVELED AT FACEBOOK\u2019S EXPLOSIVE GROWTH AND OVERLOOKED THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT AMERICANS ARE PROTECTED AND MARKETS ARE COMPETITIVE,\u201d HUGHES SAID.  LAWMAKER PRESSURE  SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN, WHO IS SEEKING THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, HAS VOWED TO BREAK UP FACEBOOK, AMAZON.COM INC AND ALPHABET INC\u2019S GOOGLE IF ELECTED.  \u201cTODAY\u2019S BIG TECH COMPANIES HAVE TOO MUCH POWER\u2014OVER OUR ECONOMY, OUR SOCIETY, & OUR DEMOCRACY. THEY\u2019VE BULLDOZED COMPETITION, USED OUR PRIVATE INFO FOR PROFIT, HURT SMALL BUSINESSES & STIFLED INNOVATION. IT\u2019S TIME TO #BREAKUPBIGTECH,\u201d WARREN SAID ON TWITTER ON THURSDAY.  REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA, A CALIFORNIA DEMOCRAT, SAID IN A STATEMENT HE AGREED IN RETROSPECT THAT U.S. REGULATORS SHOULD NOT HAVE APPROVED FACEBOOK\u2019S ACQUISITION OF INSTAGRAM AND WHATSAPP.  \u201cTHE WAY FORWARD IS TO HEAVILY SCRUTINIZE FUTURE MERGERS AND TO ENSURE NO COMPANY HAS ANTI-COMPETITIVE PLATFORM PRIVILEGES,\u201d KHANNA SAID.  IN ONE OF A NUMBER OF SCANDALS TO HIT THE COMPANY, FACEBOOK IS ACCUSED OF INAPPROPRIATELY SHARING INFORMATION BELONGING TO 87 MILLION USERS WITH THE NOW-DEFUNCT BRITISH POLITICAL CONSULTING FIRM CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA.  FACEBOOK HAS BEEN IN ADVANCED TALKS WITH THE U.S. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION TO SETTLE A YEAR-OLD INVESTIGATION AND SAID LAST MONTH IT EXPECTED TO SPEND BETWEEN $3 BILLION AND $5 BILLION.  ON MONDAY, REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC U.S. SENATORS CRITICIZED REPORTED PLANS FOR THE SETTLEMENT, CALLING ON THE FTC TO IMPOSE HARSHER PENALTIES AND MORE RESTRICTIONS ON FACEBOOK\u2019S BUSINESS PRACTICES.

HOWEVER, THE COMPANY IS NOW THE WORLD\u2019S THIRD-LARGEST CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDER, AFTER MICROSOFT CORP AND AMAZON.COM INC, AND THE LARGEST IN CHINA WITH A MARKET SHARE OF OVER 40%, ACCORDING TO DATA FROM IDC.  SELLING ANALYTICS TECHNOLOGY TO OFFLINE RETAILERS AND EXPANDING ITS ALIEXPRESS E-COMMERCE SITES ARE OTHER INITIATIVES IT IS TAKING FURTHER.  MOST OF ALIBABA\u2019S NEW INITIATIVES ARE STILL LOSING MONEY. STEVEN ZHU, SENIOR ANALYST AT PACIFIC EPOCH, SAID THAT E-COMMERCE GROWTH, WHILE SLOWING, REMAINS STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THESE NEW INVESTMENTS.  MANAGING THE GROUP\u2019S TRANSITION TO NEW AREAS OF BUSINESS IS DANIEL ZHANG, WHO WAS TAPPED BY CHAIRMAN JACK MA TO BE MA\u2019S SUCCESSOR IN SEPTEMBER 2018 AND WILL FORMALLY REPLACE HIM LATER THIS YEAR.  AN ACCOUNTANT BY TRAINING, ZHANG IS SOFT-SPOKEN AND PRAGMATIC, IN CONTRAST TO MA\u2019S FLAMBOYANCE.

FILE PHOTO: THE MERCK LOGO IS SEEN AT A GATE TO THE MERCK & CO CAMPUS IN LINDEN, NEW JERSEY, U.S., JULY 12, 2018. REUTERS/BRENDAN MCDERMID/FILE PHOTO  THE NINE JUSTICES UNANIMOUSLY DIRECTED THE PHILADELPHIA-BASED 3RD U.S. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS TO RECONSIDER ITS DECISION TO LET THE LAWSUITS PROCEED EVEN THOUGH THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAD REBUFFED MERCK WHEN THE COMPANY SOUGHT TO ADD A WARNING TO FOSAMAX\u2019S LABEL ABOUT FRACTURE RISK.  MONDAY\u2019S RULING ADDED CLARITY TO A POWERFUL DEFENSE EMPLOYED BY DRUG MAKERS THAT PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER STATE LAW ARE PREEMPTED BY THE ACTIONS OF A FEDERAL AGENCY, BECAUSE FEDERAL LAW GENERALLY TRUMPS STATE LAW UNDER THE U.S. CONSTITUTION. MERCK ARGUED THAT IT CANNOT BE PENALIZED FOR FAILING TO ISSUE A WARNING THAT THE FDA HAD BLOCKED.  MERCK IN 2008 SUBMITTED DATA TO THE FDA SUGGESTING FOSAMAX MIGHT BE LINKED TO CERTAIN BONE FRACTURES, BUT THE FDA DENIED ITS WARNING LABEL PROPOSAL. AFTER A TASK FORCE FURTHER STUDIED THE ISSUE, THE FDA IN 2010 ORDERED MANUFACTURERS TO REVISE LABELS TO INCLUDE A WARNING, WHICH MERCK DID.  THE PLAINTIFFS CONTEND THAT THE FDA REJECTED ONLY MERCK\u2019S PROPOSED LANGUAGE FOR THE WARNING THAT FOCUSED ON RELATIVELY MINOR STRESS FRACTURES RATHER THAN THE MORE SERIOUS FRACTURES THEY SUFFERED.  IN A DECISION WRITTEN BY JUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER, THE SUPREME COURT SAID A DRUG MANUFACTURER MUST SHOW IT \u201cFULLY INFORMED\u201d THE FDA OF THE NEED FOR A WARNING BEFORE IT WAS REBUFFED AND THAT JUDGES, NOT JURIES, MUST DECIDE WHETHER SUCH LAWSUITS ARE PREEMPTED, AS MERCK HAS CLAIMED. LOWER COURTS NOW MUST REVISIT THE CASE REFLECTING THE SUPREME COURT\u2019S GUIDANCE.  MERCK\u2019S SHARES WERE FLAT ON MONDAY.  FOSAMAX HELPS PREVENT AND TREAT OSTEOPOROSIS, A CONDITION THAT CAN LEAD TO BONE FRACTURES, IN WOMEN WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH MENOPAUSE. BUT IT MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF FRACTURES IN THE THIGH BONE OR JUST BELOW THE HIP JOINT, OFTEN REQUIRING SURGICAL INTERVENTION.  \u2018FULLY COMMITTED\u2019  IN A STATEMENT, MERCK SAID IT WAS PLEASED WITH THE DECISION AND \u201cREMAINS FULLY COMMITTED TO DEFENDING THESE CASES GOING FORWARD AND WILL CONTINUE TO PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT IT ACTED APPROPRIATELY AT ALL TIMES IN REGARD TO THE POTENTIAL RISK OF ATYPICAL FEMUR FRACTURES.\u201d  DAVID FREDERICK, AN ATTORNEY FOR THE FOSAMAX USERS WHO SUED MERCK, SAID MONDAY\u2019S DECISION REAFFIRMS PATIENTS\u2019 ABILITY TO HOLD DRUG COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE. \u201cTHIS OPINION PROTECTS ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR INJURED PATIENTS,\u201d FREDERICK SAID.  SALES OF FOSAMAX, ALSO AVAILABLE AS A GENERIC DRUG, TOTALED $209 MILLION IN 2018, ACCORDING TO NEW JERSEY-BASED MERCK.  FOSAMAX USERS SUED MERCK, ALLEGING THE DRUG CAUSED THEM TO SUSTAIN SERIOUS THIGH BONE FRACTURES AND THAT THE COMPANY FAILED TO WARN OF THE RISK. THE NUMBER OF CASES HAS SWELLED TO MORE THAN 1,000.  A FEDERAL TRIAL COURT IN NEW JERSEY THREW OUT THE CASES, BUT IN 2017 THE 3RD CIRCUIT ALLOWED THE CLAIMS TO PROCEED TO TRIAL, RULING THAT A JURY COULD FIND THAT THE FDA HAD OBJECTED ONLY TO MERCK\u2019S PHRASING OF THE PROPOSED WARNING LABEL.  ON MONDAY, THREE JUSTICES - JOHN ROBERTS, SAMUEL ALITO AND BRETT KAVANAUGH - AGREED WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE CASE BUT DID NOT JOIN BREYER\u2019S DECISION. IN A SEPARATE OPINION, ALITO SIGNALED SYMPATHY FOR MERCK, NOTING THE FDA HAD LONG BEEN AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND WAS COMMUNICATING WITH DRUG MANUFACTURERS, AND NOTED THAT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP\u2019S ADMINISTRATION ALSO BACKS MERCK\u2019S POSITION.", "Ticker": "MRK", "Date": "2019-05-20T00:00:00", "key": "20190520MRK", "labelr0": 0.2032520325203209, "labelr1": 0.7860040567951377, "labelr2": 1.8616352201257915, "labelr3": 0.04939491232402079, "labelr4": 0.185139471735381, "pos": 0.25, "neg": 0.264, "compound": 0.2023, "0_day_return": 0.203252032520318, "1_day_return": 0.7860040567951421, "2_day_return": 2.6622718052738525, "3_day_return": 2.712981744421916, "4_day_return": 2.9031440162272, "label": 1, "return": 0.008495835608354471, "excess_return": 0.7775082211867876, "count_of_word": 606, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.50914305, "prof1": 0.49085692, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5462042740183362, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4537957259816639, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.50914305, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.49085692, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.39975286, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.6002470999999999, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5359199, "tr_prof1": 0.46408009999999994, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.63675475, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.36324522, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.45162532, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.5483748, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.5746704, "headline_prof21": 0.4253295999999999, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.42916992, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.57083005, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.5094332, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.49056688, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.61849546, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.38150459999999997, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": -0.7860040567951421, "returnpredvader": 0.7860040567951421, "returnpredsgd": -0.7860040567951421, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0023462447848104, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.006711104937393, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9992493404402569, "cumreturn1b": 1.7334366485482453, "cumreturn1d": 1.3059548127723388, "cumreturn1e": 1.4179339858952411, "cumreturndow": 1.1411656728828725, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1084153087876611}, {"Unnamed: 0": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6977, "level_0": 6977, "index": 6977, "text": "CHICAGO, MAY 21 (REUTERS) - JPMORGAN CHASE & CO SAID ON TUESDAY THAT ONLY 71.64 PERCENT OF SHAREHOLDERS VOTED TO APPROVE ITS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PACKAGES, MARKING A RARE INSTANCE OF CRITICISM OVER THE BANK\u2019S TOP LEADERS PAY.

THE ORGANIZATIONS' LETTER TO THE FIRMS CITED A RECENT REUTERS REPORT DOCUMENTING HOW CIGARETTE MAKER PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL INC HAS USED YOUNG PERSONALITIES ON INSTAGRAM TO SELL A NEW \"HEATED TOBACCO\" PRODUCT CALLED IQOS.  THE GROUPS SAID SOCIAL MEDIA FIRMS ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO REGULATE \u201cINFLUENCERS\u201d ON THEIR PLATFORMS WHO ARE HIRED BY COMPANIES TO PROMOTE NICOTINE PRODUCTS.  NO LAW SPECIFICALLY PREVENTS ONLINE TOBACCO OR E-CIGARETTE MARKETING, BUT SOCIAL MEDIA FIRMS HAVE POLICIES LIMITING IT. THE HEALTH GROUPS SAID IN THEIR LETTER THAT THE USE OF ONLINE PERSONALITIES CREATES A \u201cLOOPHOLE\u201d IN THOSE POLICIES AND ALLOWS \u201cRAMPANT MARKETING\u201d OF TOBACCO AND OTHER NICOTINE PRODUCTS TO YOUTH.  INSTAGRAM AND ITS PARENT COMPANY, FACEBOOK, ARE STUDYING THE ISSUE \u201cTO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE,\u201d SAID SPOKESWOMAN STEPHANIE OTWAY.  THE PLATFORMS CURRENTLY BAN BRAND ADVERTISING OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS, OTWAY SAID. THEIR POLICIES REQUIRE ANY SPONSORED \u201cINFLUENCER\u201d POSTS THAT EXPLICITLY RECOMMENDED BUYING TOBACCO PRODUCTS BE RESTRICTED ONLY TO PEOPLE OVER 18.  BUT THE SAME RESTRICTION WOULD NOT APPLY TO POSTS BY PAID INFLUENCERS THAT DEPICT TOBACCO PRODUCTS FAVORABLY WITHOUT EXPLICITLY SAYING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BUY THEM, OTWAY SAID.  IN MAKING POLICY FOR A BILLION USERS, THE COMPANY HAS TO DRAW LINES BETWEEN ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONAL POSTS AND \u201cSOMEONE HAVING AN OPINION,\u201d OTWAY SAID.

A REUTERS REVIEW OF TWITTER POLICIES SHOWS THAT ITS TOBACCO PROMOTION BAN DOES NOT INCLUDE SUCH MARKETING POSTS BY INDIVIDUALS.  REUTERS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL TWITTER POSTS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS FROM INFLUENCERS WHO POSTED PHOTOGRAPHS WITH IQOS DEVICES OR LINKED BACK TO INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS PROMOTING THE PRODUCT. TWITTER DID NOT COMMENT ON THE POSTS IDENTIFIED BY REUTERS.  SNAP INC DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT.  A WOMAN HOLDS A \"HEATED TOBACCO\" IQOS DEVICE, MADE BY PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL, IN AN INSTAGRAM POST UNDER AN ACCOUNT CALLED @IQOSTYLE.ARM, WHICH HAS THE HASHTAG #IQOSARMENIA, IN A POST FROM MAY 12, 2019. @IQOSTYLE.ARM/SOCIAL MEDIA  THE MORE THAN 100 ORGANIZATIONS FROM 48 COUNTRIES THAT SIGNED THE LETTER, WHICH WAS SENT TO THE COMPANIES FRIDAY AND PUBLICLY RELEASED WEDNESDAY, INCLUDED THE CAMPAIGN FOR TOBACCO-FREE KIDS, THE JAPAN SOCIETY FOR TOBACCO CONTROL AND THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS.  REUTERS EARLIER THIS MONTH DOCUMENTED HOW PHILIP MORRIS HAD USED YOUNG SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS, INCLUDING A 21-YEAR-OLD WOMAN IN RUSSIA, TO PROMOTE ITS IQOS DEVICE. THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERNAL MARKETING STANDARDS PROHIBIT IT FROM USING YOUTH-ORIENTED CELEBRITIES OR \u201cMODELS WHO ARE OR APPEAR TO BE UNDER THE AGE OF 25.\u201d  PHILIP MORRIS SAID MAY 10 THAT IT LAUNCHED AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION AND SUSPENDED ALL \u201cPRODUCT-RELATED DIGITAL INFLUENCER ACTIONS GLOBALLY\u201d AFTER REUTERS SOUGHT THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMENT ON EXAMPLES OF INSTAGRAM POSTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS DEPICTING YOUNG, HIP WOMEN ADVERTISING IQOS.

IN ADDITION, REUTERS HAS IDENTIFIED NEW EXAMPLES OF INSTAGRAM CONTENT FEATURING YOUNG PEOPLE WITH THE IQOS POSTED IN THE DAYS SINCE PHILIP MORRIS SAID IT HAD SUSPENDED ITS INFLUENCER CAMPAIGNS.  SEVERAL POSTS UNDER THE INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT @IQOS_EGYPT OVER THE PAST WEEK HAVE FEATURED YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN USING THE DEVICE AT BARS OR COCKTAIL EVENTS. OTHER POSTS FROM ACCOUNTS USING THE IQOS NAME IN POLAND, ARMENIA, ITALY AND IRAN OVER THE LAST WEEK ALSO SHOWED YOUNG, TRENDY MEN AND WOMEN USING THE DEVICES.  OTHER POSTS EMERGED OVER THE LAST WEEK FROM A PHOTOGRAPHER WHO DOCUMENTED AN IQOS-SPONSORED VIP LOUNGE AT AN APRIL MUSIC FESTIVAL IN COLOMBIA.  A REPRESENTATIVE FOR AN IQOS STORE IN SARNO, ITALY, SAID EMPLOYEES FOUND THE RECENT PHOTOS OF WOMEN USING IQOS ELSEWHERE ONLINE AND REPOSTED THEM ON THE STORE\u2019S INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT. A REPRESENTATIVE OF AN IQOS-BRANDED INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT IN ARMENIA DENIED BEING PAID BY PHILIP MORRIS TO PROMOTE THE PRODUCT.

NONE OF THE INFLUENCERS MENTIONED IN THE MAY 10 REUTERS REPORT RESPONDED TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT ON WHETHER THEY HAD BEEN ASKED TO STOP POSTING OR REMOVE POSTS MARKETING PHILIP MORRIS PRODUCTS.  PHILIP MORRIS SPOKESMAN RYAN SPARROW SAID THE FIRM HAD \u201cDIRECTED THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO NEW POSTS\u201d BY INFLUENCERS. SPARROW DID NOT RESPOND TO QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE COMPANY HAD STOPPED PAYING INFLUENCERS OR ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE EXISTING POSTS.  SPARROW SAID SOME OF THE NEW POSTS \u201cSEEM TO ORIGINATE FROM THIRD PARTIES, NOT PMI, AND IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE DO NOT SELL IQOS,\u201d NOTING EQYPT AND IRAN.  SPARROW DEFENDED THE SUSPENDED MARKETING CAMPAIGN AS A VITAL WAY TO INFORM ADULT CIGARETTE SMOKERS ABOUT SAFER OPTIONS. HE BLASTED THE CAMPAIGN FOR TOBACCO-FREE KIDS FOR \u201cTRYING TO PRESSURE US ... TO EFFECTIVELY BLOCK THESE CHANNELS\u201d AND \u201cIN EFFECT PERPETUATING THE CONSUMPTION OF TOBACCO IN ITS MOST HARMFUL FORM: COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES.\u201d  CAROLINE RENZULLI, A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE ANTI-TOBACCO CAMPAIGN, CALLED IT \u201cLAUGHABLE\u201d THAT PHILIP MORRIS USED SOCIAL MEDIA TO MARKET TO ADULTS.  PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL HAS LICENSED ALTRIA GROUP INC TO MARKET THE IQOS DEVICE IN THE UNITED STATES BEGINNING THIS SUMMER.  ALTRIA, WHICH SELLS MARLBORO CIGARETTES IN THE UNITED STATES, HAS PREVIOUSLY SAID IT HAS A POLICY OF NOT ADVERTISING ON SOCIAL MEDIA. HOWEVER, AN ONLINE JOB POSTING FROM THE COMPANY IN MARCH SEEKS A \u201cDIGITAL MARKETING SPECIALIST\u201d FOR THE \u201cIQOS BRAND TEAM.\u201d THE IDEAL CANDIDATE WILL DEVELOP MARKETING STRATEGY FOR \u201cE-COMMERCE, OWNED WEBSITES, SOCIAL MEDIA AND INFLUENCERS.\u201d  ALTRIA SPOKESMAN DAVID SUTTON SAID THE COMPANY HAS NO PLANS TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS TO MARKET IQOS BUT DID NOT RESPOND TO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE JOB POSTING MENTIONING AN INFLUENCER STRATEGY.  ELICENA ANDRADA, A MODEL FROM SPAIN WHOSE BIOGRAPHY LISTS SHE WAS CROWNED MISS AMERICA LATINO DEL MUNDO IN 2017, HOLDS AN IQOS \"HEATED TOBACCO\" DEVICE, MADE BY PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL IN AN INSTAGRAM POST ON AN ACCOUNT CALLED @IQOS_FRIENDS, IN A POST FROM MAY 12, 2019. @IQOS_FRIENDS/SOCIAL MEDIA VIA REUTERS  REGULATORY GRAY AREA  THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) LAST MONTH DECIDED TO ALLOW U.S. SALES OF THE IQOS DEVICE AFTER A TWO-YEAR REVIEW PROCESS IN WHICH PHILIP MORRIS REPEATEDLY ASSURED THE REGULATOR THAT IT WOULD WARN YOUNG PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE PRODUCT.  DIGITAL ADVERTISING OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS REMAINS A GRAY AREA FOR REGULATORS GLOBALLY. TOBACCO ADVERTISING REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE WERE WRITTEN BEFORE THE RISE OF SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING.  THE FDA, HOWEVER, CAN EXERT AUTHORITY OVER THE DIGITAL MARKETING OF NEW DEVICES IT CLEARS FOR SALE. AS A CONDITION OF ALLOWING PHILIP MORRIS TO SELL THE IQOS DEVICE, THE AGENCY REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE DETAILED ANALYSES OF THE AGE RANGES OF CONSUMERS IT REACHES WITH ONLINE MARKETING.

IT CONTROLS ABOUT 2.7 MILLION ACRES THERE ALREADY, SPLIT BETWEEN SHALE AND CONVENTIONAL PRODUCTION, AND WITH THE ANADARKO DEAL WILL ACQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL 240,000 ACRES IN ONE OF THE MORE PRODUCTIVE AREAS OF THE PERMIAN BASIN.  THE GULF OF MEXICO BUSINESS PROVIDED NEARLY A QUARTER OF ANADARKO\u2019S OIL AND GAS OUTPUT WHILE CONSUMING JUST 19 PERCENT OF PRODUCTION SPENDING. HOLLUB HAS PRAISED IT FOR ITS \u201cAMAZING FREE CASH FLOW,\u201d AND M&A ANALYSTS SAY COULD BE WORTH AT LEAST $6 BILLION.  POTENTIAL BUYERS WOULD BE THE HANDFUL OF LARGE COMPANIES WITH DEEPWATER EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING ROYAL DUTCH SHELL, EXXON MOBIL, TOTAL AND CHEVRON.  ANOTHER REASON TO SELL IT: OCCIDENTAL HAS NEVER OPERATED IN THE GULF BEFORE. THAT RAISES CONCERNS AMONG INVESTORS, SAID JENNIFER ROWLAND, AN ANALYST WITH EDWARD JONES.  \u201cIT JUST ADDS TO THE RISK OF A DEAL. THEY DON\u2019T HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE IN HOUSE,\u201d SHE SAID.  IN THE \u2018DOGHOUSE\u2019 WITH INVESTORS  ANOTHER LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR A SALE IS WESTERN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, ANADARKO\u2019S MAJORITY-OWNED GAS GATHERING AND PIPELINE BUSINESS, VALUED AT AROUND $7.5 BILLION. OCCIDENTAL HAS PREVIOUSLY SOLD OFF PIPELINES AND COASTAL TERMINALS. THE COMPANY\u2019S VIEW OF PIPELINE ASSETS, SAID FINANCE CHIEF CEDRIC BURGHER TO ANALYSTS, IS \u201cYOU DON\u2019T NEED TO OWN\u201d THEM, ONLY TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THEM.  IF HOLLUB CAN SELL THE OFFSHORE BUSINESS AND CLOSE THE DEAL WITH TOTAL, SHE COULD HIT A $10 BILLION TO $15 BILLION DIVESTMENT TARGET, SAID MATT SALLEE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT INVESTMENT FIRM TORTOISE CAPITAL ADVISORS. THAT COULD MAKE IT LESS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WOULD SELL ANY OF ITS ONSHORE OR PIPELINE OPERATIONS, HE SAID.  \u201cTHEY WOULD PROBABLY REALLY LIKE TO GET ANOTHER SALE DONE BEFORE THE DEAL CLOSES TO REMOVE THIS RISK\u201d OF TOO MUCH DEBT, SAID CHARLES JOHNSTON, ANALYST AT DEBT RESEARCH FIRM CREDITSIGHTS.  \u201cTHE LONGER THEY TAKE\u201d TO REDUCE DEBT FROM THE DEAL, \u201cTHE LONGER THEY STAY IN THE DOGHOUSE WITH INVESTORS,\u201d SAID ROWLAND.  OCCIDENTAL\u2019S STOCK FELL TO A 10-YEAR-LOW AFTER IT REACHED A MERGER AGREEMENT WITH ANADARKO AND ANALYSTS AT WELLS FARGO, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS AND EDWARD JONES LOWERED RATINGS ON THE COMPANY.  RATING FIRMS ARE FORECASTING A DEBT DOWNGRADE BECAUSE OF THE DEAL, THOUGH NONE EXPECT OCCIDENTAL WILL FALL INTO JUNK BOND STATUS. MOODY\u2019S INVESTORS SERVICE SAID A \u201cWEAKLY POSITIONED INVESTMENT GRADE RATING\u201d IS THE MOST LIKELY FOR OCCIDENTAL.  THE SPREAD ON ITS 2027 BONDS WIDENED A MODEST 50 BASIS POINTS SINCE THE DEAL WAS STRUCK.  \u201cTHE COMPANY DOES HAVE A GOOD TRACK RECORD OF BEING ABLE TO SELL NONCORE ASSETS AT GOOD PRICES,\u201d SAID CAROL LEVENSON, DIRECTOR AT CORPORATE BOND RESEARCH FIRM GIMME CREDIT.  IN ADDITION TO PAYING OFF THE DEAL\u2019S DEBT, HOLLUB NEEDS CASH TO COVER DIVIDENDS DUE SHAREHOLDERS AND BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC, WHICH NEGOTIATED AN 8 PERCENT ANNUAL PAYOUT ON A $10 BILLION INVESTMENT TO HELP FUND THE ANADARKO DEAL.

REUTERS/NICK OXFORD/FILE PHOTO/FILE PHOTO  STAYING FOCUSED ON SHALE  WHAT HOLLUB DOESN\u2019T WANT TO SELL IS THE MERGER\u2019S TOP PRIZE, ANADARKO\u2019S ACREAGE IN THE TOP U.S. SHALE FIELD, THE PERMIAN BASIN. ANADARKO\u2019S PROPERTIES THERE ARE VALUED AT ABOUT $18 BILLION, ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH FIRM DRILLINGINFO.  ANADARKO\u2019S COLORADO SHALE OPERATIONS WILL LIKELY REMAIN WITH THE OCCIDENTAL FOR A LACK OF READY BUYERS. NEW ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT GIVE COMMUNITIES MORE CONTROL OVER OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS HAVE CHILLED INDUSTRY INVESTMENTS IN THE STATE.  OCCIDENTAL ALSO WOULD WANT TO HANG ONTO ANADARKO\u2019S COLORADO SHALE ACREAGE, SAID ANDREW DITTMAR, AN M&A ANALYST WITH DRILLINGINFO, BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS \u201cREALLY GOOD AT DRILLING SHALE WELLS.\u201d", "Ticker": "OXY", "Date": "2019-05-28T00:00:00", "key": "20190528OXY", "labelr0": -2.225547035720961, "labelr1": -0.5355776587605224, "labelr2": -0.17307692307692962, "labelr3": -4.122519745713723, "labelr4": -0.9041591320072389, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.0, "0_day_return": -2.225547035720965, "1_day_return": -0.5355776587605221, "2_day_return": -0.7077276205049832, "3_day_return": -4.801071155317526, "4_day_return": -5.661820964039799, "label": -1, "return": -0.0069119122390440685, "excess_return": -0.528665746521478, "count_of_word": 950, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.47842640000000003, "prof1": 0.52157366, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4562400053329967, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5437599946670033, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.47842640000000003, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.52157366, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.576059, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.423941, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.47444823, "tr_prof1": 0.52555174, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.63929015, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.3607099, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.42214316, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.57785684, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.60172325, "headline_prof21": 0.3982768, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.35933343, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.64066654, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.60092795, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.39907205, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.2517665, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.74823356, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -0.5355776587605221, "returnpredvader": 0.5355776587605221, "returnpredsgd": -0.5355776587605221, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9934877795339312, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0033570080809755, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9976763738793846, "cumreturn1b": 1.7521296942346152, "cumreturn1d": 1.3238713156074144, "cumreturn1e": 1.427194110103343, "cumreturndow": 1.1087596514169036, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0762508182969652}, {"Unnamed: 0": 7250, "Unnamed: 0.1": 7250, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 7250, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 7250, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 7250, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 7250, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 7250, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 7250, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 7250, "level_0": 7250, "index": 7250, "text": "(REUTERS) - CYBERSECURITY COMPANY PALO ALTO NETWORKS INC FORECAST CURRENT-QUARTER PROFIT BELOW ANALYSTS\u2019 ESTIMATES ON WEDNESDAY, LARGELY DUE TO EXPENSES RELATED TO ITS RECENT ACQUISITIONS AND A HIT FROM TARIFFS, SENDING ITS SHARES DOWN 5%.

TARIFFS ON CHINESE IMPORTS ARE A CONCERN, AS PVH SOURCES A MAJORITY OF ITS APPAREL, FOOTWEAR AND ACCESSORIES FROM THE ASIAN COUNTRY. IN 2018, THE COMPANY IMPORTED ABOUT $400 MILLION OF INVENTORY FROM CHINA.  EARLIER THIS MONTH, U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP ESCALATED THE TRADE WAR BY RAISING TARIFFS ON $200 BILLION WORTH OF CHINESE GOODS TO 25% FROM 10%. THIS WAS IN ADDITION TO THE 25% TARIFF ON $50 BILLION WORTH OF CHINESE IMPORTS ALREADY IN PLACE.  CHIRICO, IN AN INTERVIEW ON CNBC, SAID THE LATEST DISCUSSIONS ON TARIFF AND TRADE ISSUES, WHICH INCLUDES PROPOSED TARIFFS ON A FURTHER $300 BILLION WORTH CHINESE IMPORTS, WAS NOT HIS MAIN CONCERN.  \u201cTHAT (TARIFFS) IS NOT THE ISSUE GOING FORWARD...

PVH PROJECTED A 10 CENT CUT IN ITS FULL-YEAR ADJUSTED PROFIT PER SHARE DUE TO THE STRONG DOLLAR. IT NOW EXPECTS 2019 ADJUSTED PROFIT BETWEEN $10.20 AND $10.30 PER SHARE, WHICH INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE LATEST ROUND OF TARIFFS.

THEIR COMBINED MARKET CAP WAS 27.8 BILLION REAIS ($7 BILLION) AT THURSDAY\u2019S MARKET CLOSE.  TWO PEOPLE WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE TALKS SAID THEY ARE EXPECTED TO REACH AN ALL-SHARE DEAL, WITH NO CASH PAYMENTS.  TWO OTHER SOURCES CLOSE TO THE COMPANIES SAID THEIR AIM IS TO CREATE A COMPLETE PROTEIN PORTFOLIO TO COMPETE WITH GLOBAL GIANTS SUCH AS TYSON FOODS INC AND JBS.  THE COMPANIES SAID THEY WERE ENTERING A 90-DAY NEGOTIATION PERIOD TO DEFINE THE TERMS OF A DEAL, BUT AN INITIAL VALUATION SUGGESTED BRF SHAREHOLDERS WOULD HOLD A STAKE OF ROUGHLY 85% IN A COMBINED COMPANY, WITH THE REST HELD BY MARFRIG SHAREHOLDERS.  BRF AND MARFRIG WERE ATTRACTED BY THEIR COMPLEMENTARY GEOGRAPHY TOO, ACCORDING TO THE SOURCES, WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY TO DISCUSS THE CONFIDENTIAL TALKS. BRF HAS A STRONG PRESENCE IN THE BRAZILIAN MARKET AND EXPORTS MAINLY FRESH POULTRY. MARFRIG HAS A STRONGER U.S. PRESENCE AFTER ACQUIRING NATIONAL BEEF LAST YEAR.  ANOTHER PERSON CLOSE TO THE COMPANIES SAID THEY COULD REAP COST SAVINGS OF UP TO 5.5 BILLION REAIS OVER FOUR YEARS.

CITI AND JPMORGAN DID NOT IMMEDIATELY RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT.  A DEAL COULD HELP WITH BRF\u2019S HEAVY DEBT LOAD AND STRUGGLE TO REGAIN AN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT RATING.

FILE PHOTO: PEOPLE VISIT A FEDEX EXPRESS BOOTH DURING THE CHINA INTERNATIONAL IMPORT EXPO (CIIE) AT THE NATIONAL EXHIBITION AND CONVENTION CENTER IN SHANGHAI, CHINA NOVEMBER 7, 2018. REUTERS/STRINGER  BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS AND CONSULTANTS SAY THEY HAVE BEEN FIELDING A GROWING NUMBER OF INQUIRIES FROM COMPANIES ABOUT HOW BEST TO NAVIGATE THE TRADE DISPUTE. THEY EXPECT THOSE CALLS TO INTENSIFY AFTER FEDEX CORP OVER THE WEEKEND BECAME EMBROILED IN U.S.-CHINA FRICTIONS AND AN ONGOING SPAT OVER CHINESE TECH GIANT HUAWEI.  FURTHER RATTLING NERVES ARE BEIJING\u2019S PLANS TO UNVEIL AN UNPRECEDENTED HIT-LIST OF \u201cUNRELIABLE\u201d FOREIGN FIRMS, GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS THAT HARM THE INTERESTS OF CHINESE COMPANIES. CHINA\u2019S COMMERCE MINISTRY ANNOUNCED THE MOVE ON FRIDAY WITHOUT SINGLING OUT ANY COUNTRY OR COMPANY.  THE US-CHINA BUSINESS COUNCIL (USCBC), WHICH REPRESENTS ROUGHLY 200 AMERICAN COMPANIES THAT DO BUSINESS IN CHINA, TOLD REUTERS ON MONDAY THAT ANXIETY AMONG ITS MEMBERS WAS ON THE RISE, ESPECIALLY OVER THE LIST.  \u201cTHE KEY POINT FOR THEM IS THAT THERE\u2019S A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY ON HOW THE LIST WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND WHAT NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS WILL BE BROUGHT ABOUT SHOULD A COMPANY BE ADDED TO THE LIST,\u201d SAID ITS VICE PRESIDENT OF CHINA OPERATIONS, JACOB PARKER.  \u201cAT THE MOMENT MANY OF OUR COMPANIES ARE WONDERING WHETHER THIS IS AN ATTEMPT BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO INCREASE THEIR POTENTIAL LEVERAGE IN THE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS, OR IF IT\u2019S AN ACTUAL EFFORT TO FORCE COMPANIES INTO AN UNENVIABLE POSITION OF CHOOSING BETWEEN THE TWO MARKETS.\u201d  LOOMING LIST  ANALYSTS SAID U.S. COMPANIES HAD BEEN MORE SANGUINE IN THE INITIAL STAGE OF THE TRADE WAR, WITH MANY BELIEVING THAT IT COULD NOT POSSIBLY GO ON, BUT THAT BEGAN TO CHANGE AFTER WASHINGTON LAST MONTH ACCUSED BEIJING OF RENEGING ON PREVIOUS PROMISES, PROMPTING FRESH TIT-FOR-TAT TARIFFS.  THE UNITED STATES ALSO LAST MONTH PUT CHINA\u2019S HUAWEI ON A BLACKLIST THAT EFFECTIVELY BLOCKS U.S. FIRMS FROM DOING BUSINESS WITH THE SHENZHEN-BASED TELECOMS EQUIPMENT MAKER, AGGRAVATING EXISTING FRICTIONS.  \u201cWE HAVE IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS FIELDED MORE CALLS FROM FIRMS WONDERING ABOUT THE POLITICAL RISK HERE THAN WE PROBABLY HAVE IN THE LAST 10 YEARS,\u201d SAID BEN CAVENDER, AN ANALYST AT CHINA MARKET RESEARCH GROUP, WHOSE CLIENTS HAVE RANGED FROM CLOTHING RETAILERS TO CHEMICAL FIRMS.  \u201cRIGHT NOW THERE\u2019S A LOT MORE CONCERN THAT THE SITUATION REGARDING THE NEGOTIATIONS HAS BECOME SO UNSTABLE AND SO EMOTIONAL, WHEN OR IF THERE\u2019S GOING TO BE A RESOLUTION.\u201d  IT IS UNCLEAR EXACTLY HOW MANY U.S. COMPANIES DO BUSINESS WITH CHINA, BUT THE AMERICAN CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE (AMCHAM) IN BEIJING AND SHANGHAI COUNT MORE THAN 2,000 MEMBER FIRMS BETWEEN THEM.  \u201cTHIS IS A DISCOURAGING DEVELOPMENT,\u201d SAID AMCHAM SHANGHAI PRESIDENT KER GIBBS. \u201cWE ARE CONCERNED AND HAVE REQUESTED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE LIST. WE HOPE THAT BOTH SIDES CAN REFRAIN FROM THIS TYPE OF TIT-FOR-TAT BEHAVIOR AND GET BACK TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.\u201d  BEIJING-BASED AMCHAM CHINA DID NOT RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT.  \u201cAT LEAST THREE CLIENTS HAVE ASKED US ABOUT HOW THE ENTITY LIST MIGHT AFFECT THEIR BUSINESS,\u201d SAID A SHANGHAI-BASED CONSULTANT, WHO DECLINED TO BE NAMED DUE TO THE SENSITIVITY OF THE SITUATION.  EVEN SOME BRITISH FIRMS HAD SOUGHT ADVICE, HE ADDED, SAYING THEY WERE EXPRESSING WORRY OVER U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP\u2019S VISIT TO BRITAIN THIS WEEK, WHEN HE IS EXPECTED TO DEMAND THAT PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY\u2019S SUCCESSOR BAN HUAWEI FROM 5G NETWORKS.  \u201cTHEY FEAR THAT THE U.S. PRESIDENT MIGHT PRESSURE THE INCOMING PRIME MINISTER TO FOLLOW HIS POLICIES,\u201d THE CONSULTANT SAID.  SOUTH KOREA EXPERIENCE  ONE BIG CONCERN, ANALYSTS SAID, WAS THAT U.S. FIRMS COULD START TO EXPERIENCE SIMILAR TREATMENT TO THAT DOLED OUT TO SOUTH KOREAN COMPANIES IN 2017, AFTER CHINA OPPOSED SEOUL\u2019S DECISION TO INSTALL A U.S. MISSILE SYSTEM.  SOUTH KOREA\u2019S FIFTH-LARGEST CONGLOMERATE LOTTE, WAS AMONG THE WORST HIT. CHINESE AUTHORITIES SUSPENDED ITS WORK ON A $2.6 BILLION PROJECT AND ORDERED LOTTE MART STORES TO SHUT OVER WHAT THEY SAID WERE FIRE SAFETY VIOLATIONS. COMPANY OFFICIALS PRIVATELY LINKED THE ACTION TO THE MISSILE SPAT.  \u201cIT WOULD NOT BE INCONCEIVABLE THAT CHINA WILL LOOK AT, FOR EXAMPLE, LARGE RETAIL BRANDS THAT ARE OPERATING HERE AND SAYING, WELL MAYBE THEY SHOULD ALSO HAVE FIRE CODE VIOLATIONS TOO. THAT WOULD CREATE IMMEDIATE HARM TO A LOT OF BUSINESSES,\u201d CAVENDER SAID.  FILE PHOTO: PEOPLE VISIT A FEDEX EXPRESS BOOTH DURING THE CHINA INTERNATIONAL IMPORT EXPO (CIIE) AT THE NATIONAL EXHIBITION AND CONVENTION CENTER IN SHANGHAI, CHINA NOVEMBER 8, 2018. REUTERS/STRINGER  ANOTHER WORRY IS THAT U.S. CORPORATE OFFICIALS COULD PERSONALLY START TO FACE SCRUTINY OR BE INVESTIGATED IN CHINA AS A RESULT OF THE TRADE FRICTIONS, ONE CHINA-BASED FOREIGN EXECUTIVE TOLD REUTERS ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY.  SOME, HE ADDED, WERE \u201cEXPLORING SUMMER PLANS ABROAD\u201d, HAVING NOT PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED DOING SO, BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT GETTING CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE.  \u201cMANY U.S. SENIOR EXECUTIVES IN CHINA THAT I KNOW HAVE THIS GROWING CONCERN RIGHT NOW.\u201d", "Ticker": "FDX", "Date": "2019-06-04T00:00:00", "key": "20190604FDX", "labelr0": 4.759091505842195, "labelr1": -0.6266056770474341, "labelr2": -1.0971688000504505, "labelr3": 0.7459356072681007, "labelr4": 2.4174155170231573, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.0, "0_day_return": 4.7590915058421945, "1_day_return": 4.7590915058421945, "2_day_return": -1.7168995551099742, "3_day_return": -0.9837709129644656, "4_day_return": 1.4098627733567068, "label": 1, "return": 0.008161854490207184, "excess_return": 4.7509296513519885, "count_of_word": 839, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5746831, "prof1": 0.42531684, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4879663718181551, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.512033628181845, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5746831, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.42531684, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.37317824, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.62682176, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.45816997, "tr_prof1": 0.54183006, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5251796999999999, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.47482038, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.54142815, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.45857182, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.4605463, "headline_prof21": 0.53945374, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.40717217, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.59282786, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.3574203, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.6425797, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.70103747, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.2989625, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 4.7590915058421945, "returnpredvader": -4.7590915058421945, "returnpredsgd": 4.7590915058421945, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0327764271935371, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.001195665493543, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0278080687764843, "cumreturn1b": 1.8479720184628223, "cumreturn1d": 1.3141518833176518, "cumreturn1e": 1.4943483360306407, "cumreturndow": 1.1259426657640201, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0939478929804638}, {"Unnamed: 0": 7580, "Unnamed: 0.1": 7580, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 7580, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 7580, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 7580, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 7580, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 7580, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 7580, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 7580, "level_0": 7580, "index": 7580, "text": "FILE PHOTO: THE LOGO OF ECOPETROL IS PICTURED AT ITS HEADQUARTERS IN BOGOTA, COLOMBIA AUGUST 11, 2017.

ANALYSTS HAVE SAID THAT A DRUG THAT SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY TREATS LOSS OF SEXUAL DESIRE IN WOMEN COULD EVENTUALLY REACH ANNUAL SALES OF ABOUT $1 BILLION.  PALATIN\u2019S SHARES JUMPED 44% TO $1.93, WHILE AMAG SHARES ROSE 11.5% AFTER MARKET.  VYLEESI, CHEMICALLY KNOWN AS BREMELANOTIDE, ACTIVATES PATHWAYS IN THE BRAIN INVOLVED IN SEXUAL DESIRE, HELPING PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH HYPOACTIVE SEXUAL DESIRE DISORDER (HSDD).  THE DRUG WILL COMPETE WITH SPROUT PHARMACEUTICALS\u2019 ADDYI, A ONCE-DAILY PILL THAT WAS APPROVED FOR HSDD IN 2015 WITH A WARNING RESTRICTING ALCOHOL USE WHEN ON THE MEDICATION. IT WILL BE AVAILABLE FROM SEPTEMBER THROUGH SELECT PHARMACIES.  ADDYI WAS APPROVED UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE FROM ADVOCACY GROUPS DESPITE A REVIEW BY SCIENTISTS AT THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) THAT DEEMED IT MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE AND POSSIBLY UNSAFE.  VYLEESI, WHICH DOES NOT RESTRICT ALCOHOL USE, IS SEEN AS HAVING SEVERAL ADVANTAGES OVER ADDYI, INCLUDING TOLERABLE SIDE EFFECTS, RAPID-ACTING NATURE AND NOT HAVING TO TAKE IT EVERY DAY, ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS.  SIDE EFFECTS REPORTED DURING CLINICAL TRIALS INCLUDED MILD TO MODERATE NAUSEA LASTING NO MORE THAN TWO HOURS AND MOSTLY OCCURRED OVER THE FIRST THREE DOSES, AMAG SAID. ABOUT 40% OF PATIENTS IN CLINICAL TRIALS EXPERIENCED NAUSEA.  THE DRUG IS ADMINISTERED AS A SHOT INTO THE ABDOMEN OR THIGH USING AN AUTO-INJECTOR AT LEAST 45 MINUTES BEFORE ANTICIPATED SEXUAL ACTIVITY, WITH THE FDA RECOMMENDING PATIENTS NOT TO TAKE MORE THAN ONE DOSE WITHIN 24 HOURS OR MORE THAN EIGHT DOSES PER MONTH.  THE DRUG WAS DEVELOPED BY PALATIN AND AMAG HOLDS EXCLUSIVE NORTH AMERICA SALES RIGHTS. PALATIN WILL GET $60 MILLION FROM AMAG FOR THE APPROVAL PLUS ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS FOR CERTAIN SALES MILESTONES AND ROYALTIES.  HSDD AFFECTS ABOUT 6 MILLION WOMEN IN THE U.S., BUT FEW SEEK OR RECEIVE TREATMENT.  SVB LEERINK ANALYST AMI FADIA SAID THERE WILL BE A NEED FOR MORE DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA, WHICH COULD HELP IN BUILDING AWARENESS ABOUT HSDD.  \u201cTHESE WOMEN ARE JUST SUFFERING IN SILENCE AND SO THE MARKET DOESN\u2019T REALLY EXIST TODAY,\u201d AMAG CEO WILLIAM HEIDEN SAID.

SOCALGAS HAS SAID THE REDUCTIONS OR OUTAGES ON LINES 235-2, 3000 AND 4000 REDUCED PIPELINE SYSTEM CAPACITY BY ABOUT 0.7 BILLION CUBIC FEET PER DAY (BCFD).  ONE BILLION CUBIC FEET OF GAS IS ENOUGH TO SUPPLY ABOUT FIVE MILLION U.S. HOMES FOR A DAY.  ONCE SOCALGAS STARTS RETURNING THE PIPELINES TO SERVICE THIS SUMMER, THE UTILITY HAS SAID ITS OVERALL PIPELINE CAPACITY SHOULD RISE TO 2.705 BCFD FROM AROUND 2.355 BCFD NOW.  SOCALGAS HAS PROJECTED THE INCREASE IN PIPELINE CAPACITY PLUS STORAGE WITHDRAWALS OF AROUND 0.68 BCFD WOULD ENABLE IT TO MEET EXPECTED PEAK DEMAND OF 3.368 BCFD THIS SUMMER WITHOUT PULLING GAS OUT OF ALISO.  AFTER THE ALISO LEAK, THE STATE MANDATED THE STORAGE CAVERN BE USED ONLY TO MAINTAIN SYSTEM RELIABILITY AFTER ALL OTHER STORAGE FACILITIES AND PIPELINES HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED.  SOCALGAS HAS SAID LINES 235-2 AND 3000 ARE LARGELY 1957 VINTAGE PIPELINES, WHILE LINE 4000 IS LARGELY A 1960 VINTAGE PIPE.  LINE 3000 EXTENDS ABOUT 125 MILES (201 KM) WEST FROM SOUTH NEEDLES ON THE CALIFORNIA-NEVADA BORDER TO THE NEWBERRY SPRINGS COMPRESSOR STATION ABOUT 20 MILES EAST OF BARSTOW IN THE SOUTH CENTRAL PART OF THE STATE. LINE 235 EXTENDS ABOUT 46 MILES WEST FROM THE NEWBERRY COMPRESSOR TO VICTORVILLE, WHICH IS ABOUT 80 MILES NORTHEAST OF LOS ANGELES.  AFTER ALL OF THE PIPES ARE BACK, SOCALGAS HAS SAID ITS PIPELINE CAPACITY WOULD RISE TO AROUND 3.085 BCFD.", "Ticker": "SRE", "Date": "2019-07-01T00:00:00", "key": "20190701SRE", "labelr0": -0.5675203725261941, "labelr1": 1.1268842382555189, "labelr2": -0.3979739507959356, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 0.5303305484925461, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.0, "0_day_return": -0.5675203725261979, "1_day_return": -0.5675203725261979, "2_day_return": 0.7244255817356882, "3_day_return": 0.7244255817356882, "4_day_return": 1.2585979803892755, "label": -1, "return": 0.002928126008779785, "excess_return": -0.5704484985349777, "count_of_word": 393, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5296906, "prof1": 0.47030938, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4704303084734978, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5295696915265021, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5296906, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.47030938, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.42508066, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.5749193, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5005835999999999, "tr_prof1": 0.49941638, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.67641443, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.32358554, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.47782582, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.5221742, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.35491803, "headline_prof21": 0.64508206, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.45085546, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.54914445, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.74705195, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.25294805, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.44380677, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.5561931999999999, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 0.5675203725261979, "returnpredvader": 0.5675203725261979, "returnpredsgd": -0.5675203725261979, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.003522171814131, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9963542593579922, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0031384563900028, "cumreturn1b": 1.9680080135919793, "cumreturn1d": 1.280863468586749, "cumreturn1e": 1.5397836152742315, "cumreturndow": 1.184451968960886, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1473658893045056}, {"Unnamed: 0": 8714, "Unnamed: 0.1": 8714, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 8714, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 8714, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 8714, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 8714, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8714, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8714, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8714, "level_0": 8714, "index": 8714, "text": "(REPEATS FOR ADDITIONAL CLIENTS WITH NO CHANGES TO TEXT)  BY TOM POLANSEK  CHICAGO, JULY 2 (REUTERS) - U.S. HOG FARMERS LOST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN EXPORT SALES TO CHINA AND MEXICO AFTER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP LAUNCHED HIS TRADE WARS LAST YEAR.  BUT THE SECTOR HAS LARGELY OFFSET THOSE MASSIVE LOSSES BY COBBLING TOGETHER NEW CUSTOMERS IN SMALLER MARKETS FROM COLOMBIA TO VIETNAM, ACCORDING A REUTERS ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE U.S. MEAT EXPORT FEDERATION AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA).  AS AMERICAN FARMERS PIN THEIR HOPES FOR A TRADE DEAL ON TRUMP AND CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING\u2019S AGREEMENT TO RESTART TALKS AT LAST WEEK\u2019S G20 SUMMIT, THE PORK INDUSTRY STANDS OUT FOR ITS SUCCESS IN AVOIDING THE SHARP SALES REDUCTIONS THAT HAVE SLAMMED OTHER U.S. FARM SECTORS, SUCH AS SOYBEANS AND SORGHUM.  OVERALL, U.S. PORK EXPORTS FELL 3.9% BY VOLUME AND 8.4% BY VALUE FROM MAY 2018 TO APRIL 2019, COMPARED TO A YEAR EARLIER, ACCORDING TO DATA COMPILED BY THE U.S. MEAT EXPORT FEDERATION. CHINA INCREASED ITS TARIFF ON U.S. PORK IN APRIL OF LAST YEAR AND AGAIN IN JULY, WHEN IT IMPOSED TARIFFS ON SOYBEANS.  BY COMPARISON, TOTAL U.S. SOYBEAN EXPORTS DROPPED 13.7% BY VOLUME AND 19.2% BY VALUE DURING THE SAME PERIOD, WHILE TOTAL SORGHUM EXPORTS DROPPED 72.8% BY VOLUME AND 73.6% BY VALUE, ACCORDING TO THE USDA.  THE BOOM IN SMALL-MARKET SALES HAS \u201cBEEN A SAVIOR FOR THE PORK INDUSTRY,\u201d IOWA HOG FARMER DEAN MEYER SAID.  THE INDUSTRY\u2019S SALVATION HAS ROOTS IN GLOBAL MARKETING EFFORTS THAT BEGAN MORE THAN A DECADE BEFORE THE U.S-CHINA TRADE DISPUTE, AS AMERICAN HOG FARMERS AND THEIR TRADE GROUPS SOUGHT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A BOOM IN PROTEIN DEMAND LINKED RISING INCOMES IN EMERGING MARKETS.  THEY VISITED IMPORTERS AND GROCERY STORES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, TAUGHT BUYERS HOW U.S. PORK IS PRODUCED AND TOUTED ITS QUALITY TO CHEFS AND BLOGGERS AROUND THE WORLD, ACCORDING TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE TRADE TRIPS. THOSE EFFORTS TOOK YEARS TO PAY OFF.  AS CHINA AND MEXICO REDUCED THEIR PURCHASES LAST YEAR, A SUBSEQUENT DROP IN U.S. PORK PRICES HELPED ENCOURAGE ALTERNATIVE BUYERS TO RAMP UP PURCHASES - PARTICULARLY FROM SMALLER MARKETS THAT HAD TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH THE UNITED STATES, SUCH AS COLOMBIA AND SOUTH KOREA.  THE SECTOR\u2019S ABILITY TO AVOID A SHARPER DECLINE IN TOTAL EXPORTS UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING A DIVERSIFIED CUSTOMER BASE TO GUARD AGAINST ANY TRADE DISRUPTIONS WITH MAJOR IMPORTERS.  THE SOY INDUSTRY HAD GROWN SO HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON CHINA - WHICH BEFORE THE TRADE WAR PURCHASED 60% OF U.S. SOY EXPORTS, WORTH ABOUT $12 BILLION - THAT ITS MORE RECENT EFFORTS TO FIND NEW MARKETS COULDN\u2019T MAKE UP FOR THE BUSINESS IT LOST IN THE TRADE WAR. SORGHUM, A MUCH SMALLER CROP, IS EVEN MORE DEPENDENT ON CHINA, WHICH HAD ACCOUNTED FOR 80% OF U.S. EXPORTS.  BY CONTRAST, THE U.S. PORK INDUSTRY RELIED ON CHINA AND HONG KONG FOR ABOUT 20% OF EXPORTS BY VOLUME IN THE $6 BILLION MARKET BEFORE THE TRADE WAR. HOG FARMERS STARTED TO WORRY YEARS AGO ABOUT THE RISK OF A DECLINE IN DEMAND FROM CHINA, WHICH PREVIOUSLY BLOCKED SOME U.S. PORK OVER THE USE OF A DRUG THAT HELPS FATTEN HOGS.  U.S. PORK SALES TO CHINA AND HONG KONG SANK ABOUT 30% BY VOLUME AND VALUE TO ABOUT 326,726 METRIC TONS AND $737 MILLION IN THE 12 MONTHS ENDING IN APRIL, AFTER BEIJING INCREASED ITS TARIFF TO 62% FROM 12% LAST YEAR.  SALES TO MEXICO OVER THE SAME PERIOD DROPPED 11% BY VOLUME AND 25% BY VALUE, TO ABOUT 726,859 METRIC TONS AND $1.2 BILLION, AFTER MEXICO IMPOSED 20% TARIFFS ON U.S. PORK IMPORTS IN RETALIATION FOR U.S. DUTIES ON METALS IMPORTS LAST YEAR.  REPLACEMENT BUYERS IN SMALLER MARKETS - MANY OF WHICH ALREADY HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH U.S. MEAT PRODUCERS - QUICKLY STEPPED IN TO SNAP UP MUCH OF THE PORK INDUSTRY\u2019S SURPLUS.  U.S. EXPORTS TO COLOMBIA, THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, AUSTRALIA, PHILIPPINES, VIETNAM AND SOUTH KOREA CLIMBED BY 24% BY VOLUME - TO MORE THAN 530,000 METRIC TONS - IN THE 12 MONTHS ENDING IN APRIL, COMPARED TO A YEAR EARLIER, ACCORDING TO DATA FROM THE U.S. MEAT EXPORT FEDERATION. (GRAPHIC: TMSNRT.RS/2XFLUWQ )  YEARS OF SALES PITCHES  MEYER AND OTHER HOG FARMERS LIKE HIM HAVE TREKKED ACROSS THE GLOBE ON TRADE MISSIONS SEEKING NEW BUYERS FOR U.S. PORK. HE VISITED COLOMBIA IN 2015 AND PERU IN 2017, EFFORTS THAT ARE NOW SHOWING RESULTS, MEYER SAID.  COLOMBIA\u2019S IMPORTS OF U.S. PORK ROSE BY 34% TO MORE THAN 103,000 METRIC TONS IN THE 12 MONTHS ENDING IN APRIL 2019, AIDED BY THE U.S.\u2013COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT.  EXPORTS TO SOUTH KOREA JUMPED 14% TO MORE THAN 230,000 METRIC TONS IN THE 12 MONTHS ENDING IN APRIL, BOOSTED BY THE UNITED STATES-KOREA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT.  U.S. PORK SALES TO VIETNAM CLIMBED BY 334% BY VOLUME, TO MORE THAN 16,500 METRIC TONS, OVER THE SAME PERIOD.  \u201cI THINK IT\u2019S A RESULT OF DOING THESE TRADE MISSIONS, HITTING THESE MARKETS HARD,\u201d SAID MEYER, WHO ALSO SERVES ON THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE FOR THE U.S. MEAT EXPORT FEDERATION.  THIS SPRING, THE U.S. MEAT EXPORT FEDERATION ORGANIZED A PORK COOK-OFF IN HO CHI MINH CITY AND AFTERWARD HELD AN EDUCATIONAL SESSION AND RECEPTION FOR ABOUT 300 CHEFS.  U.S. FARMERS ON A SEPARATE TRADE TRIP TO VIETNAM VISITED FOOD MANUFACTURER VISSAN LAST AUTUMN, SAID NEBRASKA HOG FARMER BILL LUCKEY, WHO TOOK PART IN THE TRIP AND IS A DIRECTOR FOR THE NATIONAL PORK BOARD.  AS A RESULT, THE VIETNAMESE COMPANY SENT A DELEGATION TO TOUR U.S. MEAT PROCESSING PLANTS, OPENING THE DOOR FOR POTENTIAL DEALS, HE SAID.  \u201cWE ARE OUT THERE TRYING TO LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD,\u201d LUCKEY SAID.  VISSAN IS NOW CONSIDERING IMPORTING FROZEN U.S. PORK FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE COMPANY SAID.  IN A BID TO INCREASE INTERNATIONAL MEAT SALES, TYSON FOODS INC ADDED STAFF LAST YEAR TO INCLUDE SOUTH AMERICA, PHILIPPINES, AND THE MIDDLE EAST. HORMEL FOODS CORP ALSO ADDED STAFF, FOCUSING ON ASIA AND SOUTH AMERICA.  MISSED OPPORTUNITIES  WHILE THE PORK SECTOR HAS LIMITED ITS LOSSES, IT MIGHT MAKE GREAT GAINS IN SALES TO CHINA WERE IT NOT FOR THE TRADE WAR. AN EPIDEMIC OF A FATAL HOG DISEASE, AFRICAN SWINE FEVER (ASF), HAS DECIMATED MILLIONS OF PIGS IN CHINA\u2019S DOMESTIC HERD, INCREASING ITS RELIANCE ON PORK IMPORTS.  CHINA IS THE WORLD\u2019S TOP HOG PRODUCER AND PORK CONSUMER.  \u201cTHIS IS A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY IN CHINA BECAUSE OF ASF,\u201d SAID NICK GIORDANO, VICE PRESIDENT AND GLOBAL GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COUNSEL FOR THE NATIONAL PORK PRODUCERS COUNCIL. \u201cWE CAN\u2019T FULLY CAPITALIZE ON IT BECAUSE WE HAVE A 50% PUNITIVE TARIFF.\u201d  THE U.S. INDUSTRY DID BENEFIT FROM THE EPIDEMIC, HOWEVER. EXPECTATIONS THAT THE DISEASE WILL PUSH CHINA TO INCREASE PORK IMPORTS LIFTED U.S. HOG FUTURES BY 78% FROM A FOUR-MONTH LOW IN FEBRUARY TO A FIVE-YEAR HIGH IN MAY. PRICES HAVE SINCE DROPPED, BUT THE GAINS ALLOWED SOME FARMERS TO LOCK IN PROFITS THROUGH 2020.", "Ticker": "NSIT", "Date": "2019-07-02T00:00:00", "key": "20190702NSIT", "labelr0": -2.030456852791883, "labelr1": 1.7271157167530224, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": 0.23769100169779386, "labelr4": -3.285907859078588, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.0, "0_day_return": -2.0304568527918843, "1_day_return": -2.0304568527918843, "2_day_return": 1.7271157167530138, "3_day_return": 1.968911917098426, "4_day_return": -1.3816925734024266, "label": -1, "return": 0.007672378472751939, "excess_return": -2.0381292312646364, "count_of_word": 1144, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.50895, "prof1": 0.49105010000000004, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4620709771939797, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5379290228060203, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.50895, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.49105010000000004, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.42623067, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.5737693, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.6461094000000001, "tr_prof1": 0.3538905, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.4894023, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.5105976999999999, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.63907796, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.36092198, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.46874118, "headline_prof21": 0.53125876, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.48730144, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5126986, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.34672509999999995, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.65327495, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.23681937, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.7631806, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 2.0304568527918843, "returnpredvader": 2.0304568527918843, "returnpredsgd": -2.0304568527918843, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0031263217678639, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9969086034394807, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9990810747827668, "cumreturn1b": 1.9741606398842024, "cumreturn1d": 1.2769038116654652, "cumreturn1e": 1.5383686692810734, "cumreturndow": 1.19353953274955, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1550467968169216}, {"Unnamed: 0": 8738, "Unnamed: 0.1": 8738, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 8738, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 8738, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 8738, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 8738, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8738, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8738, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8738, "level_0": 8738, "index": 8738, "text": "LONDON, JULY 5 (REUTERS) - BOURSE SERVICES GROUP AQUIS EXCHANGE WILL BUY BRITISH GROWTH STOCKS PLATFORM NEX EXCHANGE FROM CME GROUP FOR A NOMINAL ONE POUND PLUS 2.7 MILLION POUNDS ($3.4 MILLION) TO COVER NEX\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL, AQUIS SAID ON FRIDAY.

THE HEADQUARTERS OF GERMANY'S DEUTSCHE BANK ARE PHOTOGRAPHED IN FRANKFURT, GERMANY, JULY 8, 2019. REUTERS/KAI PFAFFENBACH  GERMANY\u2019S LARGEST LENDER SAID ON JULY 7 IT WOULD RETAIN A \u201cFOCUSED\u201d ECM FRANCHISE AS WELL AS U.S. AND EUROPEAN EQUITY RESEARCH TEAMS AS PART OF A 7.4 BILLION EURO ($8.3 BILLION) SHAKE-UP WHICH ALL BUT ENDS ITS AMBITIONS ON WALL STREET.

DEUTSCHE BANK\u2019S PLANS TO SHRINK ITS ECM BUSINESS, WHICH INVOLVES RAISING MONEY FOR CORPORATE CLIENTS ON THE WORLD\u2019S STOCK MARKETS THROUGH IPOS AND PRIVATE PLACEMENTS, HAS LEFT SOME BANKERS QUESTIONING HOW IT CAN STILL COMPETE.  ITS FRANCHISE IS ALREADY UNDER PRESSURE. IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2019, DEUTSCHE BANK RANKED 13TH IN THE LEAGUE TABLE FOR GLOBAL EQUITY CAPITAL MARKET DEALS, DOWN FROM NINTH PLACE IN THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO, REFINITIV DATA SHOWS.

ECM LEAGUE TABLES CAN BE VOLATILE GIVEN THERE ARE OFTEN LARGE SWINGS IN IPO VOLUMES FROM YEAR TO YEAR, WITH REVENUES FROM SUCH ACTIVITIES AT INVESTMENT BANKS ALREADY SUFFERING FROM REDUCED ISSUANCE AND FEE PRESSURE..  HOWEVER, DEUTSCHE BANK\u2019S ECM PRACTICE MADE UP JUST 3% PERCENT OF ITS TOTAL INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUE LAST YEAR AND SOURCES SAID A FALL IN PROCEEDS WOULD NOT HIT ITS BOTTOM LINE.

JASON COX, THE ASIA-PACIFIC HEAD OF EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS WAS LAID OFF AND TEAMS WERE DISBANDED IN JAPAN, AUSTRALIA AND MOST OF ASIA, SOURCES HAVE PREVIOUSLY SAID.

AND TEAMS COULD GRADUALLY BE REDUCED FURTHER, THE SOURCES TOLD REUTERS, WITH A LIKELY KNOCK-ON EFFECT.  \u201cTHE VERY SMALL ECM TEAM THAT WE WILL HAVE GLOBALLY AFTER THIS WILL MEAN THAT WE WON\u2019T GET SENIOR ROLES IN ANY OF THE IPOS,\u201d A SENIOR DEUTSCHE BANK INVESTMENT BANKER IN ASIA SAID.  \u201cSO IF A COMPANY IN LONDON OR A UNICORN IN CHINA IS LOOKING TO DO AN IPO, THEY WOULD NOT LOOK AT DEUTSCHE AS A LEAD, NOR WILL WE PITCH FOR THAT ROLE,\u201d THE SENIOR BANKER SAID, ADDING THAT THE BANK COULD STILL PITCH FOR JUNIOR ROLES IN SOME DEALS.

FILE PHOTO: A DISH NETWORK RECEIVER HANGS ON A HOUSE IN SOMERVILLE, MASSACHUSETTS, U.S., FEBRUARY 21, 2017. REUTERS/BRIAN SNYDER/FILE PHOTO  U.S. WIRELESS CARRIERS T-MOBILE US INC (TMUS.O) AND SPRINT CORP (S.N) RECEIVED REGULATORY APPROVAL ON FRIDAY FOR THEIR $26.5 BILLION MERGER ON CONDITION THEY SELL SPRINT\u2019S PREPAID WIRELESS BUSINESS AND SOME CELL SITES TO DISH, PAVING THE WAY FOR THE SATELLITE PROVIDER, WHICH OWNS $20 BILLION WORTH OF SPECTRUM, TO ENTER THE WIRELESS PHONE MARKET AS THE NO. 4 COMPANY.  THE COMPANY FACES CHALLENGES OF PAYING FOR AND ROLLING OUT THE TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS PERSUADING CONSUMERS TO LEAVE ENTRENCHED, BIGGER RIVALS THAT ARE MUCH BETTER KNOWN.  DISH FOUNDER CHARLIE ERGEN STEPPED DOWN FROM HIS ROLE AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE IN 2017 TO FOCUS ON BUILDING THE WIRELESS BUSINESS AND HAS REMAINED STEADFAST IN THE PROJECT DESPITE CONFUSION FROM ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS.  \u201cI\u2019M NOT GOING TO CONVINCE ANYBODY IN THIS CALL, SO I\u2019M GOING TO QUIT TALKING, RIGHT?\u201d ERGEN SAID DURING THE FIRST-QUARTER EARNINGS CALL AS ANALYSTS QUESTIONED THE WIRELESS STRATEGY. \u201cBUT JUST WATCH US OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS.\u201d  DISH HAS SAID IT WILL SPEND $10 BILLION ON THE SECOND PHASE OF ITS NETWORK BUILDOUT, A CUT RATE THAT CRAIG MOFFETT, AN ANALYST WITH MOFFETTNATHANSON, SAID WAS NOT POSSIBLE IN A RESEARCH NOTE ON THURSDAY.  VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS (VZ.N) SPENDS $15 BILLION ANNUALLY JUST TO MAINTAIN ITS EXISTING NETWORK, MOFFETT SAID.  \u201cTHE IDEA THAT DISH MIGHT SPEND $10B AND THEN SOMEHOW BE FINISHED IS, WELL, JUST SILLY,\u201d HE WROTE.  ANALYSTS WITH NEW STREET RESEARCH HAD A MORE POSITIVE VIEW OF DISH\u2019S CHANCES, GIVEN ITS NETWORK WILL BE BUILT FROM THE BEGINNING WITH 5G, THE NEW WIRELESS STANDARD JUST BEGINNING TO ROLL OUT.  WORKING WITH WIRELESS NETWORK ENGINEERS, NEW STREET DETERMINED THAT DISH\u2019S COSTS TO BUILD A NETWORK WOULD BE MUCH LOWER THAN COMPETITORS BECAUSE IT IS ONLY BUILDING ONE NETWORK, COMPARED TO RIVALS WHO HAVE TO MAINTAIN MULTIPLE NETWORKS, AND DISH\u2019S NETWORK WILL BE VIRTUAL AND CAN SAVE MONEY ON THE COSTS OF MAINTAINING PHYSICAL WIRELESS TOWERS.  ULTIMATELY, DISH\u2019S COST PER UNIT OF DATA WOULD BE 75% LOWER THAN VERIZON\u2019S AND 55% LOWER THAN AT&T AND T-MOBILE\u2019S, THE ANALYSTS SAID.  ON TOP OF THE $10 BILLION DISH SAID IT WILL SPEND TO BUILD THE NETWORK, IT NEEDS ANOTHER $10 BILLION TO FUND OPERATING LOSSES, NEW STREET SAID.  IN THE DEAL TERMS ANNOUNCED ON FRIDAY, DISH HAS NO RESTRICTIONS ON WHO IT CAN PARTNER WITH ON WIRELESS AS LONG AS IT CONTINUES TO OWN THE ASSETS, SAID JEFF BLUM, DISH\u2019S SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR PUBLIC POLICY AND GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS, IN AN INTERVIEW ON FRIDAY.  PREVIOUS PRESS REPORTS SAID T-MOBILE WANTED TO IMPOSE A 5% CAP ON STRATEGIC INVESTORS IN DISH.  DISH WILL HAVE NO TROUBLE IN FINDING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO BUILD ITS NETWORK, GIVEN THERE ARE MANY COMPANIES EAGER TO HELP IT TAKE ON THE THREE BIG INCUMBENTS, NEW STREET CALCULATED.  \u201cTHERE ARE A HOST OF DEEP POCKETED COMPANIES\u201d THAT WILL WANT TO SUPPORT DISH\u2019S EFFORTS, THE ANALYSTS WROTE, NAMING AMAZON.COM INC (AMZN.O) AND GOOGLE (GOOGL.O) AS TWO POSSIBLE PARTNERS.  REUTERS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT AMAZON WAS INTERESTED IN BUYING T-MOBILE ASSETS TO GET ACCESS TO ITS NETWORK.  THE NEW YORK POST PREVIOUSLY REPORTED GOOGLE WAS IN TALKS WITH DISH TO CREATE THE FOURTH CARRIER. GOOGLE SAID, \u201cTHESE CLAIMS ARE SIMPLY FALSE,\u201d IN THE REPORT.  DISH WILL NEED A PARTNER TO DEFRAY THE FINANCIAL RISKS, SAID ANALYSTS WITH RESEARCH FIRM COWEN IN A NOTE EARLIER THIS MONTH. AMAZON AND GOOGLE WOULD BE INTERESTED GIVEN THEIR WORK IN THE INTERNET OF THINGS AND CLOUD INDUSTRY, COWEN SAID.  DISH FOLLOWS IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF AT&T INC (T.N), WHICH HAS BOTH A SATELLITE TV AND WIRELESS PHONE BUSINESS. DISH COULD OFFER A SIMILAR PACKAGE BUNDLE OF TV AND WIRELESS, THE SAME WAY AT&T DOES.  UNDER FRIDAY\u2019S AGREEMENT, DISH WILL PAY $1.4 BILLION FOR SPRINT\u2019S PREPAID BUSINESS AND $3.6 BILLION THREE YEARS LATER TO BUY SPECTRUM LICENSES.  DISH WILL BE STARTING OFF WITH 9.3 MILLION USERS FROM SPRINT\u2019S PREPAID BUSINESS, COMPARED WITH U.S. CELLULAR, CURRENTLY THE FIFTH LARGEST CARRIER IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS ABOUT 5 MILLION USERS.

REUTERS/MIKE BLAKE  NEW YORK (REUTERS BREAKINGVIEWS) - RESPONSIBILITY FOR REINING IN AMERICA\u2019S EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE IS WIDELY SPREAD. POLITICIANS, GUN OWNERS, RETAILERS, BANKS AND INVESTORS ALL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY, AND EVEN MODEST COMMITMENTS CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AFTER A WALMART STORE IN EL PASO, TEXAS BECAME THE SCENE OF A MULTIPLE SHOOTING ON SATURDAY, THE $312 BILLION U.S. RETAILER COULD PUT THAT PRINCIPLE INTO PRACTICE.  WALMART HAS ALREADY DONE MUCH TO RESTRICT ITS PEDDLING OF LETHAL WEAPONS. THE COMPANY RAISED THE MINIMUM AGE FOR PURCHASES TO 21 FROM 18 LAST YEAR, AND NO LONGER STOCKS ASSAULT-STYLE WEAPONS OR HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES. IT SHOWS NO SIGNS OF MOVING TO AN OUTRIGHT BAN, WHICH WOULD BE BOLD FOR THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST RETAILER BY SALES. NONETHELESS, THERE ARE THREE THINGS IT COULD DO THAT NEED NOT BE AT ODDS WITH ITS IMPERATIVE TO REMAIN PROFITABLE.  FIRST, THE RETAILER RUN BY DOUG MCMILLON COULD ASK CUSTOMERS NOT TO BRING WEAPONS INTO ITS STORES, EVEN WHERE STATE LAWS PERMIT THEM TO DO SO. STARBUCKS PUT OUT A \u201cRESPECTFUL REQUEST\u201d TO ITS CUSTOMERS IN 2013 ASKING \u2013 NOT TELLING \u2013 THEM TO KEEP THEIR GUNS OUT OF ITS BRANCHES. LEVI STRAUSS, CHIPOTLE AND WALMART-RIVAL TARGET HAVE MADE SIMILAR REQUESTS WHILE COSTCO WHOLESALE, WHICH OPERATES AS A MEMBER\u2019S CLUB, BANS GUNS.  SECOND, WALMART COULD ANNOUNCE A STRATEGIC REVIEW INTO THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF SELLING FIREARMS. DICK\u2019S SPORTING GOODS, WHICH PULLED ASSAULT-STYLE WEAPONS FROM ITS SHELVES IN 2018, IS DOING JUST THAT, AND HAS ALREADY SAID THAT GUNS AND AMMO CARRY LOWER MARGINS THAN OTHER KINDS OF SPORTING PRODUCTS. BESIDES, THE CASE FOR STOCKING FIREARMS IS WEAKENING. STURM, RUGER LAST WEEK SAID ITS THREE-MONTH SALES HAD DROPPED BY ONE-QUARTER FROM A YEAR EARLIER, TANKING ITS SHARES BY 19%.  FINALLY, IF WALMART IS GOING TO SELL FIREARMS, IT COULD DECLARE ITSELF OPEN TO SELLING TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED GUNS THAT CAN BE FIRED ONLY BY THEIR OWNER. DICK\u2019S BOSS ED STACK DID THAT IN NOVEMBER. SUCH WEAPONS AREN\u2019T YET AVAILABLE, AND MANY GUN ENTHUSIASTS DOUBT THEIR EFFICACY. BUT A PLEDGE OF NOTIONAL SUPPORT FROM THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST RETAILER WOULD HELP BRING CAPITAL INTO THEIR DEVELOPMENT.  NONE OF THESE STEPS MIGHT HAVE MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE MASS SHOOTINGS THAT TOOK PLACE IN RECENT DAYS. WIDER PROBLEMS \u2013 INCLUDING THE U.S. SENATE\u2019S INABILITY TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD MAKE BACKGROUND CHECKS MANDATORY IN MOST GUN SALES \u2013 ARE MORE DESTRUCTIVE BY FAR. STILL, SMALL STEPS MATTER. WALMART CAN\u2019T FIX THIS PROBLEM ALONE, BUT IT CAN DEFINITELY DO MORE THAN NOTHING.", "Ticker": "WMT", "Date": "2019-08-05T00:00:00", "key": "20190805WMT", "labelr0": -3.272394881170029, "labelr1": 1.370251370251373, "labelr2": 0.8669711941829094, "labelr3": 0.2957486136783671, "labelr4": -1.1426465167710973, "pos": 0.157, "neg": 0.378, "compound": -0.5859, "0_day_return": -3.2723948811700265, "1_day_return": 1.370251370251374, "2_day_return": 2.249102249102264, "3_day_return": 2.55150255150256, "4_day_return": 1.3797013797014035, "label": 1, "return": 0.013017017418171808, "excess_return": 1.3572343528332025, "count_of_word": 445, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.48048535, "prof1": 0.5195147, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4906889148787712, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5093110851212288, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.48048535, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.5195147, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.38025296, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.619747, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.4924122, "tr_prof1": 0.50758785, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.43203396, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.56796604, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.4599356, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.5400644, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.50942594, "headline_prof21": 0.49057406, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.30948892, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.6905110999999999, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.5569451, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.44305494, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.6879613, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.31203866, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 1.370251370251374, "returnpredvader": -1.370251370251374, "returnpredsgd": 1.370251370251374, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0047650172490028, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.014763062345501, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0040324074677027, "cumreturn1b": 2.3211021743595603, "cumreturn1d": 1.3745134060186266, "cumreturn1e": 1.604481061938422, "cumreturndow": 1.1481018102194185, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1149341080236232}, {"Unnamed: 0": 10344, "Unnamed: 0.1": 10344, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 10344, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 10344, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 10344, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 10344, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 10344, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 10344, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 10344, "level_0": 10344, "index": 10344, "text": "LONDON (REUTERS) - BRITISH DRUGMAKER GLAXOSMITHKLINE (GSK.L) IS GIVING UP ITS WORK ON DEVELOPING THREE POTENTIAL VACCINES AGAINST THE DEADLY EBOLA AND MARBURG VIRUSES, DESPITE AN ONGOING EBOLA OUTBREAK IN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.

THE DISEASE HAS KILLED MORE THAN 1,800 PEOPLE IN THE CONGO OUTBREAK WHICH BEGAN A YEAR AGO AND HAS BECOME THE SECOND-WORST ON RECORD.  GSK SAID SABIN HAD AGREED A COLLABORATION DEAL WITH THE VACCINE RESEARCH CENTER AT THE U.S. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES (NIAID) TO FURTHER DEVELOP THE VACCINE CANDIDATES.  THE CHAD3 SHOT WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED BY NIAID IN COLLABORATION WITH THE SWISS-BASED FIRM OKAIROS, WHICH WAS BOUGHT BY GSK IN 2013.

NARASIMHAN SAID THE DECISION TO DELAY NOTIFYING REGULATORS WAS NOT TIED TO TIMING OF THE DRUG\u2019S APPROVAL PROCESS.  THE FDA OFFICIAL WHO WROTE A MEMORANDUM DETAILING THE MANIPULATION RELEASED ON TUESDAY SAID HE BELIEVES THAT HAD REGULATORS BEEN AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS, ZOLGENSMA APPROVAL WOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED. HOWEVER, HE ALSO SAID HE BELIEVES IT WOULD HAVE ULTIMATELY BEEN APPROVED.  ZOLGENSMA WAS APPROVED IN LATE MAY AS A ONE-TIME TREATMENT FOR SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY (SMA), THE LEADING GENETIC CAUSE OF DEATH IN INFANTS.. THE DISEASE OFTEN LEADS TO PARALYSIS, BREATHING DIFFICULTY AND DEATH WITHIN MONTHS FOR BABIES BORN WITH THE DISEASE.  THE FDA SAID IT DID NOT BELIEVE THE MANIPULATION AFFECTS THE SAFETY OR LATER HUMAN TESTING OF THE THERAPY, AND IT BELIEVES THE TREATMENT SHOULD REMAIN ON THE MARKET. THE MANIPULATED DATA WAS USED TO ILLUSTRATE COMPARABILITY BETWEEN AN EARLY VERSION OF ZOLGENSMA AND THE CURRENT VERSION, WHICH IS MANUFACTURED USING A DIFFERENT PROCESS.  NARASIMHAN SAID NOVARTIS LEARNED OF ALLEGATIONS OF DATA MANIPULATION IN MID-MARCH, MORE THAN TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE GENE THERAPY\u2019S U.S. APPROVAL.  THE COMPANY FINISHED A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION INTO THE ALLEGATIONS IN EARLY MAY, CONFIRMING DATA DISCREPANCIES AND RAISING DATA INTEGRITY CONCERNS, THE CEO SAID.  NOVARTIS FOLLOWED THAT UP WITH A \u201cFULL TECHNICAL QUALITY INVESTIGATION\u201d OF THE DATA. ON JUNE 28, NARASIMHAN SAID THE COMPANY COMMUNICATED ITS FINDINGS TO THE FDA.  IT NOTIFIED REGULATORS IN EUROPE AND JAPAN SHORTLY AFTERWARD, AND DOES NOT EXPECT THE ISSUES TO AFFECT TIMING OF ZOLGENSMA\u2019S DEVELOPMENT THERE.  NOVARTIS ACQUIRED THE THERAPY\u2019S MAKER, AVEXIS, IN 2018. THE DRUGMAKER SAID IT WAS IN THE PROCESS OF \u201cEXITING\u201d THE AVEXIS SCIENTISTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MANIPULATION AND DOES NOT BELIEVE THE ISSUE EXTENDS BEYOND THOSE SCIENTISTS.  ZOLGENSMA IS NO LONGER ON TRACK FOR ACCELERATED APPROVAL IN EUROPE, BUT THE COMPANY SAID IT STILL EXPECTS APPROVAL THERE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.

THE HIRING PLANS ARE THE FIRST PUBLICLY DETAILED STEPS BOEING WILL TAKE AS IT WORKS TO DELIVER HUNDREDS OF GROUNDED 737 MAX JETS TO AIRLINES GLOBALLY, AN UNDERTAKING THAT WOULD AMOUNT TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST LOGISTICAL OPERATIONS IN MODERN CIVIL AVIATION.  CHICAGO-BASED BOEING HAS BEEN UNABLE TO DELIVER ANY 737 MAX AIRCRAFT SINCE THE SINGLE-AISLE PLANE WAS GROUNDED WORLDWIDE IN MARCH AFTER TWO FATAL CRASHES IN INDONESIA AND ETHIOPIA KILLED 346 PEOPLE, CUTTING OFF A KEY SOURCE OF CASH AND HITTING MARGINS.  GLOBAL AIRLINES HAVE HAD TO CANCEL THOUSANDS OF FLIGHTS AND USE SPARE AIRCRAFT TO COVER ROUTES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY FLOWN WITH THE FUEL-EFFICIENT MAX, EATING INTO THEIR PROFITABILITY. MANY CARRIERS HAVE TAKEN THE MAX OFF THEIR SCHEDULES LATE INTO THE FALL OR EARLY 2020.  BOEING REITERATED ON TUESDAY THAT IT WAS WORKING TOWARD GETTING THE 737 MAX FLYING AGAIN COMMERCIALLY IN THE \u201cEARLY FOURTH QUARTER\u201d AFTER IT WINS APPROVAL OF REPROGRAMMED SOFTWARE FOR THE STALL-PREVENTION SYSTEM AT THE CENTER OF BOTH CRASHES.

WHEN THE 737 MAX HAS BEEN - WHEN THE COMPLICATIONS TO IT HAVE BEEN SATISFACTORILY ASSESSED, AND THE MAX IS SAFE TO RETURN TO SERVICE, THAT\u2019S THE ONLY CRITERIA.\u201d  BOEING SAID IT PLANS TO MOVE ALL THE AIRCRAFT FROM MOSES LAKE, AN EASTERN WASHINGTON LOCATION WHERE IT RUNS TEST FLIGHTS, TO FACILITIES IN THE SEATTLE AND EVERETT AREAS WHERE ITS FACTORIES ARE LOCATED.  HUNDREDS OF BOEING 737 MAX JETS REMAIN GROUNDED WORLDWIDE, AND BOEING HAS CONTINUED BUILDING THE JETS AT A RATE OF 42 PER MONTH IN THE SEATTLE AREA. THE U.S. PLANEMAKER IS ALSO STORING FRESHLY BUILT AIRCRAFT OUTSIDE ITS FACTORIES IN RENTON AND EVERETT, AROUND SEATTLE. IT ALSO HAS JETS PARKED AT A FACILITY IN SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS.  THE TOTAL COST SO FAR OF THE 737 MAX CRISIS IS MORE THAN $8 BILLION, MAINLY DUE TO COMPENSATION THE PLANEMAKER WILL HAVE TO PAY AIRLINES FOR THE DELAYED DELIVERIES AND LOWER PRODUCTION.

FILE PHOTO: A SIGN IS SEEN OUTSIDE A BRANCH OF LLOYDS BANK IN CENTRAL LONDON FEBRUARY 3, 2014. REUTERS/LUKE MACGREGOR/FILE PHOTO  LLOYDS ON MONDAY SAID IT WILL SET ASIDE UP TO AN EXTRA 1.8 BILLION POUNDS ($2.2 BILLION) TO SETTLE PPI CLAIMS, WHILE BARCLAYS (BARC.L) LATER SAID IT WOULD SET ASIDE BETWEEN 1.2 BILLION POUNDS AND 1.6 BILLION POUNDS.  LLOYDS ALSO SAID IT WAS SUSPENDING ITS 2019 SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM.  THE HUGE PROVISIONS SHOW HOW BANKS IN BRITAIN ARE STILL BATTLING WITH THE LEGACY OF THE SCANDAL, EVEN AFTER THE AUG. 29 DEADLINE FOR CONSUMERS TO COMPLAIN, AS A RUSH OF CUSTOMER ENQUIRIES IN THE RUN-UP TO THAT DATE FORCED THEM TO SET ASIDE MORE COMPENSATION MONEY.  PPI POLICIES WERE SOLD ALONGSIDE A PERSONAL LOAN OR MORTGAGE TO COVER REPAYMENTS IF BORROWERS FELL ILL OR LOST JOBS, BUT MANY WERE UNSUITABLE.  BRITAIN\u2019S HIGH COURT IN 2011 RULED THAT CONSUMERS COULD RETROACTIVELY SEEK COMPENSATION FOR MIS-SOLD POLICIES.  THE SUBSEQUENT RUSH OF CLAIMS HAS BEEN A BOON FOR CONSUMERS, EGGED ON BY A RISE IN SO-CALLED CLAIMS MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, WITH LENDERS HAVING PAID OUT MORE THAN 36 BILLION POUNDS IN TOTAL AND THE FINAL TALLY EXPECTED TO TOP 50 BILLION POUNDS.  RBS (RBS.L) SAID LAST WEEK IT FACED ADDITIONAL COSTS OF UP TO 900 MILLION POUNDS, WHILE CLYDESDALE BANK MADE A FRESH 300-450 MILLION POUND PROVISION.  AS BRITAIN\u2019S BIGGEST DOMESTIC LENDER, LLOYDS HAS BEEN THE MOST EXPOSED TO PPI AND HAS ALREADY PAID OUT MORE THAN 20 BILLION POUNDS.  LAST MINUTE CLAIMS  LLOYDS SAID ON MONDAY IT HAD RECEIVED 600,000-800,000 REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT PPI PER WEEK IN AUGUST, WELL ABOVE ITS EXPECTATIONS OF AROUND 190,000 PER WEEK.  AS A RESULT, IT EXPECTS TO SET ASIDE A FURTHER 1.2-1.8 BILLION POUNDS IN ITS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS TO COVER PAYOUTS.  LLOYDS ALSO SAID IT HAD RECEIVED A CLAIM SUBMITTED BY THE INSOLVENCY SERVICE\u2019S OFFICIAL RECEIVER ON BEHALF OF BANKRUPT CONSUMERS, PUSHING COSTS HIGHER.  IT ADDED THE CHARGE WOULD DENT ITS PROFITABILITY AND IT SCRAPPED GUIDANCE FOR A RETURN ON TANGIBLE EQUITY OF AROUND 12% THIS YEAR. IT ALSO WARNED THE INCREASE IN ITS CAPITAL RATIO IN 2019 WOULD BE BELOW ITS 170-200 BASIS POINTS PER ANNUM GUIDANCE.  BARCLAYS SAID IT STILL AIMS TO HOLD ITS CORE CAPITAL LEVEL AT ITS 13% TARGET BY YEAR-END.  LLOYDS MADE PPI PROVISIONS WORTH 650 MILLION POUNDS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR, MEANING THE TOTAL COMBINED COST FOR 2019 COULD HIT AS MUCH AS 2.45 BILLION POUNDS, EQUIVALENT TO 41% OF ITS 6 BILLION POUNDS PRETAX PROFIT LAST YEAR. THE BANK SET ASIDE 750 MILLION POUNDS FOR PPI IN 2018.  ANALYSTS AT BROKER KBW SAID THE TOP END OF THE LLOYDS CHARGE AT 1.8 BILLION POUNDS WAS MARGINALLY BETTER THAN THEIR WORST CASE SCENARIO, WHILE THE BARCLAYS PROVISION WAS HIGHER THAN THE 700 MILLION POUNDS THEY HAD PREDICTED.  LLOYDS WAS GIVEN SOME BREATHING SPACE ON CAPITAL IN MAY, WHEN REGULATORS REDUCED ITS REQUIRED CORE CAPITAL RATIO TO 12.5% FROM 13%, EQUATING TO AROUND 1 BILLION POUNDS.

FILE PHOTO: A MAN WALKS PAST AN OFFICE OF DEUTSCHE BANK IN HANAU, GERMANY, APRIL 27, 2015. REUTERS/KAI PFAFFENBACH  THE DISCUSSIONS IN RECENT WEEKS, WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, ARE PRELIMINARY, THE SOURCES SAID, ADDING THAT THERE IS NOTHING IMMINENT. A DEUTSCHE BANK SPOKESMAN SAID THE BANK HAS NO PLANS TO ADD ADDITIONAL ASSETS INTO THE SO-CALLED CAPITAL RELEASE UNIT, OR BAD BANK.  NEVERTHELESS, IT IS ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT HAS COME UP FOR DISCUSSION AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS AT THE BANK, AS EXECUTIVES GRAPPLE WITH THE PROBLEM OF HAVING TO TURN AROUND THE BANK ON A TIGHT BUDGET, ACCORDING TO THE THREE PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE TALKS.  DEUTSCHE BANK NEEDS MORE CAPITAL TO BE ABLE TO ABSORB THE LOSSES THAT WILL LIKELY COME FROM SHEDDING PROBLEMATIC ASSETS, SUCH AS LONG-DATED DERIVATIVES, THAT ARE STILL ON ITS BOOKS, THE PEOPLE SAID.  BUT, AFTER RAISING 29.3 BILLION EUROS ($32.3 BILLION) IN CAPITAL OVER THE PAST NINE YEARS, IT DOES NOT HAVE ROOM TO ASK INVESTORS FOR MORE, THE SOURCES ADDED.  FOR INVESTORS, STILL NURSING A 75% FALL IN THE BANK\u2019S SHARE PRICE OVER THE PAST FOUR-AND-A-HALF YEARS, IT MEANS THAT THE ROAD TO RECOVERY FOR THE BANK WILL MOST LIKELY BE LONG.  CHRISTIAN SEWING, WHO TOOK OVER FROM JOHN CRYAN IN APRIL LAST YEAR, IS LOOKING TO RESHAPE DEUTSCHE BANK AFTER A MULTI-YEAR BET ON BUILDING A GLOBAL INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS UNRAVELED.  IN JULY, HE SET UP THE BAD BANK, CALLED A CAPITAL RELEASE UNIT (CRU), TO HOUSE 74 BILLION EUROS OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS THE BANK HAD IDENTIFIED FOR WIND-DOWN OR SALE, PART OF A BROADER RESTRUCTURING THAT WILL SEE 18,000 JOBS GO AS IT EXITS UNPROFITABLE BUSINESSES. DEUTSCHE BANK SET ASIDE A 7.4 BILLION EURO BUDGET TO FUND THE RESTRUCTURING.  SOME ANALYSTS HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL WHETHER THE PLAN FULLY RECOGNIZES THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM ASSETS STILL SITTING ON DEUTSCHE BANK\u2019S BALANCE SHEET. THEY REMAIN PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EXPOSURE TO LEVEL 3 ASSETS, WHICH ARE THE MOST ILLIQUID AND HARD-TO-VALUE.  \u201cIT\u2019S A PARTIAL CLEAN-UP,\u201d SAID DAVID HENDLER, AN INDEPENDENT ANALYST AT NEW YORK-BASED VIOLA RISK ADVISORS. HENDLER ADDED THAT DEUTSCHE BANK HAS 18 BILLION EUROS IN HARD-TO-VALUE ASSETS ON ITS BALANCE SHEET, WHICH HE ESTIMATED WILL TAKE YEARS TO OFFLOAD.  \u201cTHEY\u2019RE TRYING TO PAINT A PICTURE OF PROGRESS BUT THERE\u2019S STILL A LOT OF SLUDGE IN THERE,\u201d HE SAID.  LEVEL 3 ASSETS, WHICH CAN INCLUDE DISTRESSED DEBT AND DERIVATIVES, ARE NOT NECESSARILY LOSS MAKING.  DEUTSCHE BANK HAS SAID THAT THE CRU\u2019S FOCUS IS ON RELEASING CAPITAL RATHER THAN RING-FENCING TOXIC ASSETS. IN A MEMO TO STAFF ON JULY 8, SEWING DESCRIBED THE ASSETS WITHIN IT AS \u201cHIGH QUALITY\u201d AND SAID MOST WERE OF A SHORT DURATION.  ONLY 30% OF DEUTSCHE BANK\u2019S 25 BILLION EUROS WORTH OF LEVEL 3 ASSETS HAVE SO FAR BEEN PLACED WITHIN THE CAPITAL RELEASE UNIT, ACCORDING TO A PRESENTATION THE BANK GAVE ALONGSIDE ITS QUARTERLY RESULTS IN JULY.  THE BANK HAS TRIED TO SHED SOME OF THOSE ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDE LONGER-DATED DERIVATIVES, OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. BUT IT HAD LITTLE SUCCESS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT PREPARED TO TAKE THE WRITEDOWNS THE SALES WOULD HAVE REQUIRED, THE SOURCES SAID.  A SALE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET CAN LEAD TO A CAPITAL HIT IF THE PRICE IS BELOW WHAT THE BANK VALUES IT AT ON ITS BOOKS, LEADING TO A LOSS.  DEUTSCHE BANK MUST STAY WITHIN THE BUDGET IT HAS SET FOR ITS RESTRUCTURING TO AVOID HAVING TO RAISE FUNDS FROM INVESTORS, THE SOURCES SAID.  IT SET UP THE CAPITAL RELEASE UNIT WITH A VIEW TO SHEDDING ASSETS IT COULD REALISTICALLY FIND BUYERS FOR OR WIND-DOWN IN THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS, THE SOURCES SAID. THAT, IN TURN, WOULD FREE UP CAPITAL TO FUND THE SALE OF LONGER-TERM ASSETS THAT WILL REQUIRE BIGGER WRITEDOWNS, THE SOURCES SAID.  OF THE ASSETS CURRENTLY IN THE UNIT, DEUTSCHE BANK PLANS TO RUN A FORMAL AUCTION OF ITS EQUITY DERIVATIVES BOOK AS SOON AS THIS MONTH, SEVERAL SOURCES FAMILIAR WITH THE SALE PROCESS HAVE TOLD REUTERS. IF THOSE SALES ARE SUCCESSFUL, THE BANK COULD MOVE MORE ASSETS INTO THE RESTRUCTURING UNIT, THE THREE SOURCES CLOSE TO THE BANK SAID.", "Ticker": "DB", "Date": "2019-09-19T00:00:00", "key": "20190919DB", "labelr0": 0.12406947890818595, "labelr1": -0.9913258983890962, "labelr2": -2.503128911138926, "labelr3": -2.6957637997432595, "labelr4": 0.0, "pos": 0.255, "neg": 0.168, "compound": -0.0516, "0_day_return": 0.12406947890819532, "1_day_return": 0.12406947890819532, "2_day_return": -3.4696406443618377, "3_day_return": -6.0718711276332105, "4_day_return": -6.0718711276332105, "label": 1, "return": -0.0048955766146197436, "excess_return": 0.12896505552281504, "count_of_word": 742, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.43510303, "prof1": 0.56489706, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5690739798538114, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4309260201461886, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.43510303, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.56489706, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.3627346, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.6372653, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.48330933, "tr_prof1": 0.5166907000000001, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.6489779, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.35102215, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.6853719, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.3146281, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.5608924, "headline_prof21": 0.4391076, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.48935425, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.51064575, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.62510705, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.37489292, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.7731158, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.2268842, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 0.12406947890819532, "returnpredvader": -0.12406947890819532, "returnpredsgd": -0.12406947890819532, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0021516432434256, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0051390312038595, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9971924837800067, "cumreturn1b": 2.553902036643011, "cumreturn1d": 1.2817778306806331, "cumreturn1e": 1.5760291618854152, "cumreturndow": 1.1920455267190748, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1537219716335083}, {"Unnamed: 0": 12000, "Unnamed: 0.1": 12000, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 12000, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 12000, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 12000, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 12000, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12000, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12000, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12000, "level_0": 12000, "index": 12000, "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO (REUTERS) - BRAZILIAN STATE-RUN OIL FIRM PETROBRAS HAS IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS BATTLED AN EPIC CORRUPTION PROBE, A CRIPPLING RECESSION AND UNSTEADY CRUDE PRICES.

THEFT FROM PETROBRAS PIPELINES SOARED TO A RECORD HIGH 261 INCIDENTS IN THE STATES OF RIO DE JANEIRO AND SAO PAULO LAST YEAR, UP FROM JUST ONE CASE IN 2014, ACCORDING TO AN AUGUST SECURITIES FILING AND STATEMENTS MADE TO REUTERS BY REPRESENTATIVES OF PETROLEO BRASILEIRO SA (PETR4.SA), AS THE COMPANY IS FORMALLY KNOWN.  MOST OF THOSE HEISTS, POLICE SAY, ARE THE WORK OF SOPHISTICATED CRIMINAL GROUPS, SOME WITH THEIR OWN TRUCKS, DISTRIBUTION FIRMS AND EVEN RETAIL GAS STATIONS.  \u201cTHEY\u2019RE CREATIVE CREATURES,\u201d SAID JULIO DA SILVA FILHO, THE HEAD OF A RIO POLICE UNIT THAT INVESTIGATES OIL THEFT.  CRIME COSTS PETROBRAS\u2019 DISTRIBUTION SUBSIDIARY, PETROBRAS TRANSPORTE SA, OR TRANSPETRO, OVER 150 MILLION REAIS ($37 MILLION) PER YEAR, PETROBRAS CHIEF EXECUTIVE ROBERTO CASTELLO BRANCO SAID AT AN EVENT IN JUNE.  THE ALLEGED LOSSES ARE TINY COMPARED TO THOSE OF ANOTHER LATIN AMERICAN ENERGY POWERHOUSE - MEXICO - WHERE CRIME GANGS HAVE INFILTRATED THE PETROLEUM BUSINESS IN A BIG WAY. FUEL THEFT COSTS STATE-RUN PEMEX OVER $3 BILLION ANNUALLY, ACCORDING TO COMPANY FIGURES.  BUT STAMPING OUT BRAZIL\u2019S PROBLEMS EARLY, DA SILVA SAID, WILL BE CRUCIAL TO KEEPING GANGSTERS FROM BECOMING ENTRENCHED IN ITS OIL INDUSTRY.  \u201cWE\u2019RE WORKING EXACTLY TO PREVENT BRAZIL FROM TURNING INTO MEXICO,\u201d HE SAID.  TRANSPETRO HAS SET UP A PROGRAM TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE ON CRIMINAL GROUPS AND IS SPENDING 100 MILLION REAIS ($24 MILLION) A YEAR TO FUND IT, ACCORDING A HIGH-RANKING COMPANY SOURCE, WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY TO AVOID RETALIATION FROM ORGANIZED CRIME GROUPS.  AROUND 50 STAFFERS ARE NOW STUDYING THE ISSUE, INCLUDING TRACKING THE PATTERNS AND METHODS OF OIL THIEVES AND SHARING THOSE FINDINGS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE PERSON SAID. THE COMPANY, WHICH DID NOT RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT, HAS ALSO SET UP A HOTLINE FOR THE PUBLIC TO REPORT FUEL ROBBERY.  SOME FOREIGN INVESTORS, TOO, ARE BEEFING UP SECURITY. THEY INCLUDE TAG, A PIPELINE UNIT THAT FRANCE\u2019S ENGIE SA (ENGIE.PA) BOUGHT FROM PETROBRAS FOR $8.6 BILLION IN APRIL.  THE FIRM TOLD REUTERS IN A STATEMENT THAT IT IS WORKING WITH TRANSPETRO, WHOSE PIPELINES OFTEN RUN BESIDE TAG\u2019S PIPES, TO INCREASE FOOT PATROLS AND REINFORCE PHYSICAL BARRIERS, AMONG OTHER MEASURES.  \u201cTHIS PHENOMENON IS BECOMING VERY ORGANIZED,\u201d SAID EMMANUEL DELFOSSE, TAG\u2019S CHIEF OPERATIONAL OFFICER. \u201cIT\u2019S HARD TO GO AFTER THESE PEOPLE.\u201d  CRIMES OF OPPORTUNITY  FUEL IS AN EXPENSIVE COMMODITY IN BRAZIL, WHERE THE PUMP PRICE OF GASOLINE WORKS OUT TO MORE THAN $4 A GALLON.  CRIME GANGS TRADITIONALLY FOCUSED ON NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING HAVE BRANCHED OUT INTO FUEL THEFT IN RECENT YEARS, ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES. SO HAVE SO-CALLED MILITIAS, POLICE SAY, WHICH SPRANG UP TO BATTLE DRUG GANGS BUT HAVE MORPHED INTO FEARSOME CRIME OUTFITS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT.  THESE GROUPS ARE HIGHLY ORGANIZED, WITH SEPARATE DIVISIONS DEDICATED TO TAPPING ILLEGALLY INTO PIPELINES, TRANSPORTING THE STOLEN FUEL AND KEEPING A LOOKOUT FOR COPS, SAID SIMONE SIBILIO, THE HEAD PROSECUTOR FOR RIO STATE\u2019S ORGANIZED CRIME UNIT.  SHE SAID GANGSTERS FENCE THE PRODUCT THROUGH FIRMS SUCH AS ASPHALT COMPANIES WHOSE OPERATIONS REQUIRE LARGE AMOUNTS OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. THEY ALSO SELL TO UNSCRUPULOUS GAS STATION OWNERS, UNDERCUTTING LEGAL COMPETITORS ON PRICE, AUTHORITIES SAID.  CROOKS HAVE ALSO MUSCLED INTO RETAIL SALES. POLICE SAY CRIMINALS ENTERED THE GAS STATION BUSINESS YEARS AGO AS A MEANS OF LAUNDERING CASH FROM OTHER ILLICIT OPERATIONS. NOW, STOCKING THOSE PUMPS WITH STOLEN FUEL HAS BECOME A LUCRATIVE NEW PROFIT CENTER, AUTHORITIES SAID.  FIRST CAPITAL COMMAND, ONE OF BRAZIL\u2019S MOST NOTORIOUS CRIME GANGS, CONTROLS AROUND 300 GAS STATIONS IN SAO PAULO STATE, ACCORDING TO PAULO MIRANDA, HEAD OF THE GAS STATION INDUSTRY GROUP FECOMBUSTIVEIS. THAT COMES TO AROUND 3% OF THE STATE\u2019S APPROXIMATELY 9,000 GAS STATIONS.  \u201cIT\u2019S A FUEL MAFIA,\u201d MIRANDA SAID.  FIGHTING BACK  PETROBRAS CEO CASTELLO BRANCO HAS CALLED FOR HARSHER SENTENCES FOR PIPELINE ATTACKERS TO REDUCE FUEL THEFT.  THE FIRM IS ALSO CLOSE TO SIGNING FORMAL AGREEMENTS WITH MEXICO\u2019S PEMEX AND COLOMBIA\u2019S ECOPETROL ECO.CN TO FACILITATE THE SHARING OF ANTI-THEFT STRATEGIES, THE TRANSPETRO SOURCE SAID.  NONE OF THOSE COMPANIES RESPONDED TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT.  IN THE MEANTIME, HEIGHTENED VIGILANCE APPEARS TO BE PAYING OFF. THROUGH THE END OF JULY, FUEL HEISTS IN BRAZIL WERE DOWN 33% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, PETROBRAS SECURITIES FILINGS SHOW, THOUGH THEY REMAIN HIGH BY HISTORICAL STANDARDS.

GABRIEL POIAVA, ONE OF THE DETECTIVES ON THAT CASE, SAID IT\u2019S AN EXAMPLE OF GANGSTERS LOOKING UP AND DOWN BRAZIL\u2019S OIL SUPPLY CHAIN TO SEE WHERE THEY COULD GRAB A PIECE OF THE RICHES.  \u201cIF THEY BELIEVED SOME ACTIVITY COULD BE EXTORTED THERE, THEY WOULD TRY,\u201d HE SAID.", "Ticker": "PBR", "Date": "2019-09-20T00:00:00", "key": "20190920PBR", "labelr0": 0.06882312456985401, "labelr1": 0.1375515818432005, "labelr2": -1.0989010989011, "labelr3": 0.4166666666666701, "labelr4": 0.7607192254495119, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.669, "compound": -0.7964, "0_day_return": 0.06882312456986117, "1_day_return": 0.06882312456986117, "2_day_return": -0.9628610729023211, "3_day_return": -0.5502063273727487, "4_day_return": 0.20632737276480287, "label": 1, "return": -9.69358983607796e-05, "excess_return": 0.06892006046822195, "count_of_word": 891, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5742465999999999, "prof1": 0.4257534000000001, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5185145914415188, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4814854085584812, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5742465999999999, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.4257534000000001, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.4096665, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.59033346, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.50816005, "tr_prof1": 0.49183995, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.6095813, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.39041865, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.6942786999999999, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.30572128, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.64618665, "headline_prof21": 0.35381338, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.44807762, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5519223000000001, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.36945742, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.6305425, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.4383223, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.5616777, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -0.06882312456986117, "returnpredvader": -0.06882312456986117, "returnpredsgd": -0.06882312456986117, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.003807762774017, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0055260831444073, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.000351328792902, "cumreturn1b": 2.5636266897466267, "cumreturn1d": 1.2888610415456323, "cumreturn1e": 1.5765828663084387, "cumreturndow": 1.1919299747150554, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1543610433148777}, {"Unnamed: 0": 12050, "Unnamed: 0.1": 12050, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 12050, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 12050, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 12050, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 12050, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12050, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12050, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12050, "level_0": 12050, "index": 12050, "text": "LORDSTOWN, OHIO (REUTERS) - WHEN ASKED ABOUT REPORTS GENERAL MOTORS CO (GM.N) MAY TURN ITS SHUTTERED LORDSTOWN, OHIO, PLANT INTO A BATTERY FACTORY, \u201cBUFFALO\u201d JOE NERO SNORTS AND POINTS AT THE VAST COMPLEX THAT UNTIL SIX MONTHS AGO MADE THE CHEVROLET CRUZE.  A \"UAW ON STRIKE\" SIGN IS SEEN DURING A RALLY OUTSIDE THE SHUTTERED GENERAL MOTORS LORDSTOWN ASSEMBLY PLANT DURING THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS NATIONAL STRIKE IN LORDSTOWN, OHIO, U.S. SEPTEMBER 20, 2019. REUTERS/REBECCA COOK  \u201cYOU CAN\u2019T SUPPORT A PLANT LIKE THIS MAKING BATTERIES. WE NEED A NEW VEHICLE ALLOCATED TO US,\u201d SAID NERO, 62, WHO HAS WORKED AT FIVE PLANTS OVER 42 YEARS WITH THE NO. 1 U.S. AUTOMAKER.  \u201cIT WOULDN\u2019T EVEN COVER 10% OF THE FACILITY OR HIRE 10% OF THE PEOPLE, AND THEY WOULDN\u2019T PAY ENOUGH TO SUPPORT YOURSELF, LET ALONE A FAMILY,\u201d HE SAID.  THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS (UAW) UNION, WHICH WENT ON STRIKE LAST WEEK, AGREES.  THE SPRAWLING LORDSTOWN PLANT AT ONE TIME EMPLOYED MORE THAN 4,500 WORKERS. GM\u2019S DECISION TO CLOSE IT AND THREE OTHER U.S. FACILITIES DUE TO SAGGING U.S. PASSENGER CAR SALES HAS DRAWN WIDESPREAD CRITICISM, INCLUDING FROM PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. OHIO IS A CRUCIAL SWING STATE IN THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  THE CLOSURE IS PART OF THE REASON FOR THE UAW STRIKE, TO DEMAND THAT GM BUILD ANOTHER VEHICLE THERE. THE UNION ALSO WANTS GM TO REDUCE THE USE OF TEMPORARY WORKERS AND SHARE MORE OF ITS PROFITS, A DECADE AFTER THE UNION HELPED THE COMPANY THROUGH A GOVERNMENT-LED BANKRUPTCY.  VISITING NEARBY YOUNGSTOWN SOON AFTER BECOMING PRESIDENT IN 2017, TRUMP TOLD WORKERS THAT FACTORY JOBS WOULD NOT LEAVE, ADVISING THEM: \u201cDON\u2019T MOVE, DON\u2019T SELL YOUR HOUSE.\u201d SINCE GM\u2019S ANNOUNCEMENT, TRUMP HAS URGED THE DETROIT COMPANY TO MOVE VEHICLE PRODUCTION BACK TO THE UNITED STATES FROM MEXICO.  AS PART OF CONTRACT TALKS WITH THE UAW, GM HAS SUGGESTED THE LORDSTOWN FACILITY COULD BE CONVERTED TO AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE (EV) BATTERY PLANT. SEPARATELY, IT SAYS IT IS ALSO NEGOTIATING TO SELL THE PLANT TO A GROUP AFFILIATED WITH EV START-UP WORKHORSE GROUP INC (WKHS.O).  A SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH GM\u2019S PLANS SAID IF THE SALE GOES AHEAD, THE AUTOMAKER WOULD THEN BUILD A NEW BATTERY PLANT NEAR THE LORDSTOWN FACILITY.  WORKHORSE DECLINED TO COMMENT.  IN WASHINGTON IN JUNE, GM CHIEF EXECUTIVE MARY BARRA DEFENDED THE WORKHORSE PLAN. SHE ALSO TOLD REUTERS THAT GM HAD NO INTENTION OF BUILDING A NEW VEHICLE IN LORDSTOWN.  LORDSTOWN WORKERS SAY THAT\u2019S THE ONLY WAY THERE WILL BE ENOUGH WELL-PAID MANUFACTURING JOBS FOR THE COMMUNITY. THEY - AND THE UAW - PLACE THE BLAME SQUARELY ON GM.  \u201cYOU DID EVERYTHING GM EVER ASKED OF YOU AND IT STILL WASN\u2019T ENOUGH,\u201d UAW LOCAL 1112 PRESIDENT TIM O\u2019HARA TOLD 100 CHEERING WORKERS DURING A RALLY OUTSIDE THE PLANT ON FRIDAY. \u201cWE\u2019RE GOING TO HOLD THE LINE AS LONG AS IT TAKES.\u201d  THE REALITY IS THAT GM NEEDS TO CUT BACK UNDERUTILIZED U.S. MANUFACTURING CAPACITY EVEN AT CURRENT LEVELS, SAID SAM FIORANI, A VICE PRESIDENT WITH AUTO FORECAST SOLUTIONS.  \u201cTHERE\u2019S NO CHANCE THAT GM IS GOING TO PUT A PRODUCT BACK INTO THAT PLANT,\u201d HE SAID. \u201cTHEY HAVE TOO MUCH CAPACITY AS IT IS.\u201d  GM\u2019S CAPACITY UTILIZATION RATE IN ITS NORTH AMERICAN PLANTS IS ABOUT 75 PERCENT, EXCLUDING IDLED ASSEMBLY PLANTS IN LORDSTOWN AND DETROIT, RESEARCH FIRM LMC AUTOMOTIVE SAID.  THE LAST CRUZE  THE 6.2-MILLION-SQ FOOT (576,000 SQ METERS) LORDSTOWN COMPLEX HAS MANUFACTURED MORE THAN 16 MILLION VEHICLES SINCE IT OPENED IN 1966. THE LAST CRUZE ROLLED OFF THE LINE IN MARCH.  MOST WORKERS HERE HAVE TAKEN TRANSFERS TO OTHER GM PLANTS. BUT AROUND 450 WORKERS HAVE NOT, MANY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO UPROOT THEIR FAMILIES.  EVEN IF THE WORKHORSE DEAL GOES THROUGH, WORKERS WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE THE PLANT WOULD EMPLOY, WHETHER THEY WOULD STILL BE WORKING FOR GM AND WHAT KIND OF PAY CUT THAT WOULD ENTAIL.  UAW WORKERS AT THE TOP OF THE WAGE SCALE EARN ABOUT $31 AN HOUR, COMPARED WITH THE $15-$17 AN HOUR WORKERS ARE PAID AT A GM BATTERY PLANT NEAR DETROIT THAT OPERATES UNDER A SIDE AGREEMENT.  ANALYSTS SAID NEITHER A WORKHORSE NOR A GM PLANT WOULD BE LIKELY TO EMPLOY EVEN HALF THE PLANT\u2019S PREVIOUS WORKFORCE.  \u201cNOTHING OTHER THAN VEHICLE PRODUCTION HAS EVEN A HOPE OF REPLACING THE JOBS AND INCOME AND ECONOMIC IMPACT OF WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY THERE AS AN AUTOMOTIVE ASSEMBLY PLANT,\u201d SAID KRISTIN DZICZEK, VICE PRESIDENT OF INDUSTRY, LABOR AND ECONOMICS AT THE CENTER FOR AUTOMOTIVE RESEARCH BASED IN ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN.  THE UAW SAID IN A 2018 RESEARCH PAPER THAT THE DISRUPTIVE EFFECT OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND THEIR LESS COMPLEX BATTERIES COMPARED WITH GASOLINE-POWERED ENGINES MEANT THAT FEWER WORKERS WERE GOING TO BE NEEDED IN THE FUTURE.  TERESA OAKES, 44, HAS DONE THE MATH.  \u201cIF THEY MADE BATTERIES HERE IT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO LOWER WAGES TO THE BARE MINIMUM,\u201d SAID OAKES, WHO WORKED AT THE PLANT FOR 10 YEARS. \u201cGM SHOULD BRING BACK VEHICLES THEY MAKE IN MEXICO AND HAVE THEM MADE BY U.S. WORKERS INSTEAD.\u201d  MOST OTHER JOBS IN THE LORDSTOWN AREA PAY LESS, INCLUDING AT WAREHOUSES LIKE THE ONE DISCOUNT RETAILER TJX COMPANIES INC (TJX.N) IS BUILDING NEARBY.  RICK MICHAELS, 49, TOOK A TRANSFER TO A PLANT IN LANSING, MICHIGAN, AND TRAVELS 4-1/2 HOURS HOME EVERY WEEKEND TO SEE HIS FAMILY. HE WAS ON THE PICKET LINE AT LORDSTOWN ALL WEEK.  \u201cIF GM OPENED A BATTERY FACTORY HERE, THAT WOULD BARELY EMPLOY ALL THE PEOPLE HERE,\u201d MICHAELS SAID ON FRIDAY, POINTING AT THE RALLY CROWD. \u201cTHERE WOULD BE NO WAY FOR ME TO GET BACK HOME.\u201d  SLIDESHOW (7 IMAGES)  DOUG GRANT, 59, WAS PICKETING IN A HOMEMADE T-SHIRT THAT READ \u201cDID YOU MAKE $21,905,256 IN 2017\u201d ON THE FRONT AND \u201cMARY BARRA DID!\u201d ON THE BACK.  GRANT, WHO SAID HE DECLINED TO TAKE A TRANSFER TO ANOTHER GM FACILITY, SAID IT COULD TAKE YEARS TO GET A BATTERY PLANT UP AND RUNNING.  \u201cTHAT\u2019S WAY TOO LONG,\u201d HE SAID. \u201cTHAT PUTS ME RIGHT OUT OF THE GAME.\u201d", "Ticker": "GM", "Date": "2019-09-23T00:00:00", "key": "20190923GM", "labelr0": -0.3478726251003357, "labelr1": -1.2620837808807703, "labelr2": 0.9246668479738815, "labelr3": 1.3473457289140394, "labelr4": -0.5051847912789091, "pos": 0.225, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.4404, "0_day_return": -0.3478726251003317, "1_day_return": -0.3478726251003317, "2_day_return": -0.3490870032223592, "3_day_return": 0.9935553168635812, "4_day_return": 0.4833512352309333, "label": -1, "return": -0.00841637110881327, "excess_return": -0.3394562539915184, "count_of_word": 993, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.47273059999999995, "prof1": 0.52726936, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.466559623336885, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5334403766631151, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.47273059999999995, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.52726936, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.3110702, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.68892986, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.48936660000000004, "tr_prof1": 0.51063335, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.47701052, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.5229895, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.40292335, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.5970767, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.3775355, "headline_prof21": 0.6224645000000001, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.4706577, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.52934235, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.30045405, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.6995458999999999, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.6401140000000001, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.35988608, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": -0.3478726251003317, "returnpredvader": -0.3478726251003317, "returnpredsgd": -0.3478726251003317, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9907969536168414, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9929637999124356, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9925452764785165, "cumreturn1b": 2.540033514411785, "cumreturn1d": 1.2797923573722505, "cumreturn1e": 1.5648298769314013, "cumreturndow": 1.181898249712135, "cumreturnsp500": 1.148269240027731}, {"Unnamed: 0": 12106, "Unnamed: 0.1": 12106, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 12106, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 12106, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 12106, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 12106, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12106, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12106, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12106, "level_0": 12106, "index": 12106, "text": "WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - WALMART INC IS EXPANDING AN EDUCATION PROGRAM IT BEGAN LAST YEAR BY OFFERING HEALTHCARE DEGREES FOR $1 A DAY, ITS LATEST PUSH TO BEEF UP ITS PRESENCE IN THE FAST-GROWING HEALTH AND WELLNESS MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES.

TEEKAY LNG SAID ON MONDAY THAT ITS 50-50 YAMAL LNG JOINT VENTURE HAD BEEN DEEMED A \u201cBLOCKED PERSON\u201d UNDER THE SANCTIONS BECAUSE ITS PARTNER CHINA LNG SHIPPING (HOLDING) (CLNG) IS 50% OWNED BY COSCO DALIAN.  \u201cAS A RESULT OF CLNG\u2019S 50% INTEREST, THE YAMAL LNG JOINT VENTURE ALSO CURRENTLY QUALIFIES AS A \u2018BLOCKED PERSON\u2019 UNDER OFAC RULES,\u201d TEEKAY SAID, REFERRING TO THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT\u2019S OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL (OFAC).  \u201cTEEKAY GROUP HAS NOT TRADED AND WILL NOT TRADE WITH IRAN AND WILL NOT ACT IN CONTRAVENTION OF ANY TRADING SANCTIONS,\u201d TEEKAY SAID.  THE VENTURE OWNS ARC7-CLASS LNG TANKERS CAPABLE OF NAVIGATING THROUGH ARCTIC ICE, MAKING THEM KEY TO TRANSPORTING LNG FROM NOVATEK\u2019S (NVTK.MM) YAMAL LNG PLANT IN NORTHERN RUSSIA.  THE LNG PLANT, SURROUNDED BY THICK ICE DURING THE WINTER, IS UNIQUE IN OPERATING IN SUCH HARSH CONDITIONS. THE ARC7 TANKERS TAKE LNG WESTWARD TO EUROPE IN WINTER AND EASTWARD TO ASIA IN SUMMER WHEN ICE ALONG THE NORTHERN SEA ROUTE DISSIPATES SUFFICIENTLY TO ALLOW PASSAGE.  ITS YAMAL LNG PROJECT \u201cHAS ALL THE NECESSARY CAPABILITIES TO ENSURE THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCED LNG TO BUYERS WITHIN THE AGREED BY CONTRACTS SCHEDULES,\u201d NOVATEK SAID IN A STATEMENT.

COMCAST MAY BE DRAWING A LINE IN THE SAND AND WANTS TO AVOID LETTING GOOGLE DO TO THE VIDEO AD BUSINESS WHAT IT HAS DONE TO THE ONLINE AD MARKET.  IT IS THE FIRST TIME ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH ITS OWN MUSCULAR LOBBYING APPARATUS IN WASHINGTON, IS TAKING SIDES IN THE ANTITRUST BATTLE LOOMING OVER THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SELLER OF ONLINE ADS.

THE ISSUES RAISED BY COMCAST AND ITS SUBSIDIARY HAVE BEEN ECHOED WIDELY IN THE CABLE AND AD TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES. MOST COMPANIES THAT CONTEND GOOGLE HAS UNFAIRLY SQUEEZED THEM OUT HAVE BEEN RETICENT TO SPEAK OUT BECAUSE THEY RELY ON GOOGLE SERVICES AND FEAR RETALIATION.  BUT COMCAST, WHICH OWNS MEDIA COMPANY NBC, UNIVERSAL PICTURES AND THE XFINITY INTERNET SERVICE, IS A LARGE SPENDER ON STATE AND FEDERAL LOBBYING AND ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND A VETERAN OF POLITICAL ORGANIZING.  THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND A COALITION OF 50 STATE-LEVEL ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE EACH ASKED GOOGLE FOR INFORMATION ABOUT ITS ADS BUSINESS IN RECENT WEEKS AS THEY BEGIN INVESTIGATING POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF ANTITRUST LAW.  GOOGLE DECLINED TO COMMENT ON COMCAST\u2019S RECENT ACTIONS BUT HAS SAID IT IS COOPERATING WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS AND THAT IT FACES ROBUST COMPETITION IN ADVERTISING, INCLUDING FROM COMCAST.  PRIVACY PUSH  FREEWHEEL\u2019S TENSIONS WITH GOOGLE STEM FROM A ONE-OF-A-KIND AGREEMENT STRUCK IN 2009 AS YOUTUBE SOUGHT TO BURNISH ITS IMAGE WITH CLIPS FROM WELL-KNOWN TV CHANNELS.  THE DEAL ENABLES MEDIA COMPANIES SUCH AS NBC, TURNER, NOW OWNED BY AT&T INC, AND VIACOM INC TO SELL ADS ALONGSIDE THEIR CONTENT ON YOUTUBE USING FREEWHEEL\u2019S TECHNOLOGY RATHER THAN GOOGLE\u2019S COMPETING TOOL, ENSURING ACCESS TO THEIR SINGLE, PREFERRED SYSTEM ACROSS VARIOUS STREAMING WEBSITES AND APPS.  FREEWHEEL IS THE GO-TO VIDEO AD SERVER BECAUSE OF ITS EXPERIENCE, SAID A FREEWHEEL CLIENT, SPEAKING ON THE CONDITION OF ANONYMITY.  BUT LAST YEAR, GOOGLE CLOSED FREEWHEEL\u2019S PIPE INTO YOUTUBE IN EUROPE, CITING THE EU\u2019S GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION THAT IMPOSED NEW REQUIREMENTS ON COMPANIES SEEKING TO SHARE CONSUMER DATA.  IN THE UNITED STATES, GOOGLE HAS ALLOWED FREEWHEEL\u2019S CONTINUED USE ON THE CONDITION THAT STARTING WITH TESTS THIS MONTH, THE TENS OF MEDIA COMPANIES RELIANT ON IT WILL BE CUT OFF FROM ACCESSING SOME USER DATA FOR PRIVACY REASONS, ONE OF THE SOURCES SAID. THE DATA REDUCTION COULD MAKE FREEWHEEL\u2019S SYSTEM LESS ATTRACTIVE TO MEDIA COMPANIES AND THEIR ADVERTISERS, POTENTIALLY PROMPTING A SHIFT TO GOOGLE, THE SOURCE SAID.  GOOGLE SAID A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF YOUTUBE REVENUE IS AFFECTED AND THAT IT HAS BEEN WORKING WITH FREEWHEEL TO RESTORE ACCESS IN EUROPE AND PRESERVE IT IN THE UNITED STATES.  A FREEWHEEL REPRESENTATIVE BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE AT A PRIVATE HEARING IN SEPTEMBER OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE\u2019S TECH TASK FORCE, LED BY REPUBLICAN SENATOR MARSHA BLACKBURN, THE SOURCES BRIEFED ON THE DISCUSSION SAID.  BLACKBURN, WHO IS HOLDING HEARINGS TO INFORM POTENTIAL PRIVACY LAWS, SAID ON C-SPAN LAST WEEK THAT A CONGRESSIONAL PRIVACY BILL BEING WEIGHED MUST PRESERVE COMPETITION BETTER THAN EU REGULATIONS HAVE. HER SPOKESWOMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT ON FREEWHEEL\u2019S TASK FORCE COMMENTS.  INTERNET TRACKING  THE CONFLICT IS PLAYING OUT ON ANOTHER FRONT. GOOGLE SAID LAST MONTH IT IS EXPERIMENTING WITH ENCRYPTING THE INTERNET TRAFFIC OF CHROME USERS, AND ANDROID HAS SIMILAR CAPABILITY IN ITS NEWEST VERSION.  THE MOVE, TECHNICALLY KNOWN AS DNS-OVER-HTTPS, INCREASES USERS\u2019 PRIVACY AND SECURITY BY LIMITING SOME COMPANIES, INCLUDING INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, FROM TRACKING USERS\u2019 BROWSING.

FILE PHOTO: PHARMACEUTICAL TABLETS AND CAPSULES ARE ARRANGED IN THE SHAPE OF A U.S. DOLLAR SIGN ON A TABLE IN THIS PICTURE ILLUSTRATION TAKEN IN LJUBLJANA AUGUST 20, 2014. REUTERS/SRDJAN ZIVULOVIC  THE COMPANY HAS HELD BACK ON MARKETING THE PHARMACY BENEFIT PLAN WHILE IT TALKS TO THESE GROUPS, CVS SAID.  THE PLAN, LAUNCHED A YEAR AGO, IS BASED ON ANALYSES BY THE INSTITUTE FOR CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC REVIEW (ICER), A BOSTON-BASED GROUP THAT ASSESSES EFFECTIVENESS OF DRUGS TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE PRICES.  USING ICER\u2019S COST EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT, CVS DECIDES WHETHER TO INCLUDE SECOND OR THIRD MEDICINES ENTERING THE MARKET IF THERE ARE ALREADY SIMILAR ONES IN THE PLAN.  OPPOSITION TO THE CVS PLAN IS PART OF MUCH BROADER CONCERNS CITED BY DRUG COMPANIES AND ADVOCACY GROUPS, MANY OF WHICH RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. SOME SAY THAT ICER\u2019S ANALYSIS BASED ON ADDITIONAL YEARS OF \u201cQUALITY LIFE\u201d GAINED FROM A GIVEN TREATMENT IS ARBITRARY AND DISREGARDS THE COSTS OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND PATIENT NEEDS.  MORE THAN 50 GROUPS, INCLUDING DRUGMAKERS, PHRMA, THE INDUSTRY\u2019S MAIN LOBBY GROUP, AND OTHER ADVOCACY GROUPS, HAVE PROVIDED COMMENT DURING A PUBLIC INPUT PERIOD INCLUDED IN A REVIEW BY ICER OF ITS ASSESSMENT METHODS. MANY ASKED ICER TO ELIMINATE PRICE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM ITS EFFICACY ANALYSES.  ICER HAS DEFENDED ITS METHODS, WHICH ARE BASED ON A WIDELY-USED COST EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS.  THE SOFT ROLLOUT OF CVS\u2019 ICER-RELATED PRODUCT COMES AS EMPLOYER HEALTH PLAN SPONSORS - ITS BIGGEST CLIENTS - ARE SHOWING INCREASED CONCERN OVER THEIR COST FOR NEW HIGH-PRICED DRUGS, AND ARE CONSIDERING REFUSING TO PAY FOR THEM AT ALL, CVS CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER TROY BRENNAN SAID IN A RECENT INTERVIEW.  IF CORPORATE CUSTOMERS FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT THREAT, CVS SAID IT COULD CHANGE TACTICS WITH THE PLAN.  RISING DRUG PRICES, PARTICULARLY FOR EXPENSIVE SPECIALTY TREATMENTS FOR SEVERE OR DEADLY CONDITIONS, HAVE PUSHED ANNUAL U.S. HEALTHCARE SPENDING TO $3.65 TRILLION, AND MADE THEM UNAFFORDABLE FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS.  EARLIER THIS YEAR, NOVARTIS AG (NOVN.S) LAUNCHED ZOLGENSMA, A MORE THAN $2 MILLION GENE THERAPY FOR A RARE BUT DEADLY DISEASE CALLED SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY.  THE NEW CVS PROGRAM, CITED AS AN EXAMPLE OF ICER\u2019S GROWING INFLUENCE ON U.S. DRUG PRICING, WOULD NOT APPLY TO SUCH A BREAKTHROUGH TREATMENT. IT IS A TINY PLAN BY CVS STANDARDS AS THE COMPANY MANAGES PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS FOR MORE THAN 102 MILLION PEOPLE AND ALSO OWNS AETNA INSURANCE AND A NATIONAL PHARMACY CHAIN.  NOT WIDELY PROMOTED  THE PLAN\u2019S SCOPE IS LIMITED TO SO-CALLED ME TOO DRUGS, THOSE WHERE SIMILAR EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS ALREADY EXIST, AND AIMS TO PRESSURE DRUGMAKERS TO SET LOWER PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, TWO OF THREE VERY SIMILAR DRUGS FOR MIGRAINE APPROVED IN 2018 COULD HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED, BUT DRUGMAKERS SET PRICES ICER DEEMED COST EFFECTIVE.  CVS HAS LIMITED SALES AND MARKETING FOR THE PLAN WHILE IT TALKS TO PATIENT GROUPS WHO OPPOSE IT. ABOUT 240,000 CVS EMPLOYEES AND A FEW LARGE CLIENTS\u2019 EMPLOYEES ARE ENROLLED THUS FAR. THE COMPANY DECLINED TO COMMENT ON EXACT MEMBERSHIP.  \u201cWE ARE NOT WIDELY PROMOTING THIS PROGRAM,\u201d BRENNAN SAID, ADDING THAT CVS IS WORKING TO ADDRESS PATIENT GROUPS\u2019 CONCERNS.  MEANWHILE, BRENNAN SAID SOME EMPLOYERS ARE CONSIDERING REFUSING TO PAY FOR MILLION-DOLLAR TREATMENTS LIKE GENE THERAPY. THEY ARE SAYING, \u201cI\u2019M NOT GOING TO COVER THESE KINDS OF THERAPIES NO MATTER WHAT THEIR COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS IS IF THEY\u2019VE GOT A REALLY HIGH COST.\u201d  LARGE HEALTHCARE CONSULTANT AND BROKERAGE MERCER SAID IT HAS BEGUN TO FIELD SIMILAR CONCERNS.  \u201cWE HAVE CERTAINLY GOTTEN SOME PLAN SPONSORS SAYING \u2018WHAT IF WE DON\u2019T COVER SPECIALTY DRUGS?\u2019\u201d SAID DAVID DROSS, WHO RUNS MERCER\u2019S MANAGED PHARMACY PRACTICE.

CEDAR FAIR SHARES WERE TRADING AT AROUND $58 RIGHT BEFORE REUTERS BROKE NEWS OF SIX FLAGS\u2019 BID ON WEDNESDAY.  CEDAR FAIR RESPONDED THAT SIX FLAGS\u2019 BID WAS TOO LOW, NOT LEAST BECAUSE IT DID NOT COMPENSATE CEDAR FAIR SHAREHOLDERS FOR GIVING UP ON THE COMPANY\u2019S TAX-ADVANTAGEOUS PUBLICLY TRADED PARTNERSHIP. THIS ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO PAY OUT THE MAJORITY OF ITS EARNINGS TO SHAREHOLDERS WITHOUT FIRST PAYING U.S. FEDERAL OR STATE INCOME TAXES.

LAST MONTH, AFTER THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU FILED A BRIEF AT THE U.S. SUPREME COURT ARGUING THAT ITS OWN DIRECTOR WAS APPOINTED UNDER AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION, I PREDICTED THAT THE BUREAU\u2019S ABANDONMENT OF ITS LONGSTANDING DEFENSE OF ITS OWN CONSTITUTIONALITY WAS GOING TO AFFECT THE CFPB\u2019S ENTIRE MISSION.  NOW WE\u2019RE BEGINNING TO SEE THE FIRST RIPPLES FROM THE CFPB\u2019S NEW POSITION. AND IF THE SUPREME COURT DIDN\u2019T ALREADY UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY OF RESOLVING THE FUTURE OF THE FEDERAL AGENCY THAT\u2019S SUPPOSED TO MAKE SURE CONSUMERS AREN\u2019T BEING RIPPED OFF BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CFPB\u2019S SWEEPING CASE AGAINST THE MORTGAGE SERVICER OCWEN SHOULD SET OFF ALARM BELLS. THE JUSTICES ARE SCHEDULED TO CONFERENCE THIS FRIDAY ON A PETITION BY THE CALIFORNIA DEBT RESOLUTION FIRM SEILA LAW, WHICH IS CHALLENGING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE CFPB\u2019S STRUCTURE. THE OCWEN LITIGATION SHOWS THE UNCERTAINTY THAT WILL CLOUD CFPB LITIGATION IF THE JUSTICES PUNT.  WANT MORE ON THE CASE? LISTEN TO THE ON THE CASE PODCAST.  HERE\u2019S THE BACKGROUND ON THE OCWEN CASE. THE CFPB BROUGHT AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST OCWEN IN 2017, SEEKING AN INJUNCTION AND MONEY DAMAGES FOR MORTGAGE SERVICING VIOLATIONS ON THOUSANDS OF LOANS. OCWEN\u2019S LAWYERS AT GOODWIN PROCTER MOVED TO DISMISS THE CASE, ARGUING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT THE CFPB\u2019S STRUCTURE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE ITS OMNIPOTENT DIRECTOR CAN ONLY BE FIRED FOR GOOD CAUSE, ALLEGEDLY IN VIOLATION OF SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE. (OCWEN\u2019S LAWYERS DID NOT RESPOND TO MY EMAIL ABOUT THE CASE.)  ON SEPT. 5, U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE KENNETH MARRA OF WEST PALM BEACH MOSTLY DENIED OCWEN\u2019S DISMISSAL MOTION. THE JUDGE REJECTED THE MORTGAGE SERVICER\u2019S CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT, CITING RULINGS IN WHICH THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND 9TH U.S. CIRCUIT COURTS OF APPEAL HELD THAT THE CFPB\u2019S STRUCTURE DOES NOT VIOLATE SEPARATION OF POWERS DOCTRINE.  JUDGE MARRA\u2019S DECISION CAME BEFORE THE CFPB CHANGED ITS POSITION AND DECIDED THAT ITS STRUCTURE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. SO LATE LAST WEEK, OCWEN ASKED JUDGE MARRA TO RECONSIDER HIS RULING IN LIGHT OF THE CFPB\u2019S NEW POSITION - AND ITS FILING MAKES CLEAR JUST HOW PERILOUS THIS CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION COULD TURN OUT TO BE FOR THE CFPB.  AS YOU SURELY RECALL, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE CFPB SAID IN THEIR JOINT BRIEF ENCOURAGING THE SUPREME COURT TO TAKE UP THE ISSUE OF THE CFPB\u2019S CONSTITUTIONALITY THAT THERE\u2019S AN EASY FIX FOR THE LAW\u2019S DEFECT: THE JUSTICES NEED ONLY SEVER THE PROVISION INSULATING THE CFPB DIRECTOR FROM ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE PRESIDENT AND STRIKE THE LANGUAGE MANDATING THAT THE DIRECTOR CAN ONLY BE REMOVED FOR GOOD CAUSE. THE GOVERNMENT PORTRAYED THE SEPARATION-OF-POWERS ISSUE AS A PROBLEM THAT CAN BE SOLVED WITHOUT ANY DISRUPTION TO THE CFPB\u2019S WORK.  THE NEW OCWEN MOTION SHOWS THAT THE CFPB'S TARGETS HAVE A DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT VIEW OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE CFPB\u2019S ALLEGEDLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE. THE BRIEF ARGUED THAT IF THE CFPB IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, AS THE BUREAU ITSELF NOW CONCEDES, ITS SWEEPING CASE AGAINST THE MORTGAGE SERVICER MUST BE DISMISSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.  OCWEN CONTENDS THAT UNDER THE SUPREME COURT\u2019S HOLDING IN 2018\u2019S LUCIA V. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, A PARTY THAT RAISES A CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE TO FEDERAL AGENCY ACTION IS ENTITLED TO MEANINGFUL RELIEF IF IT WINS. AND UNDER 2010\u2019S FREE ENTERPRISE FUND V. PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD AND 1995\u2019S RYDER V. U.S., OCWEN ARGUED, WHEN AN AGENCY\u2019S DIRECTOR HAS BEEN APPOINTED UNDER AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION, THE DIRECTOR DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BRING AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION. THEREFORE, ACCORDING TO OCWEN, IT IS ENTITLED TO NOTHING LESS THAN THE DISMISSAL OF THE CFPB\u2019S CASE, WITH PREJUDICE.  THE CFPB DID NOT RESPOND TO MY EMAIL REQUESTING COMMENT ON OCWEN\u2019S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OR THE MORTGAGE SERVICER\u2019S ARGUMENT THAT THE AGENCY\u2019S CASE MUST BE DISMISSED NOW THAT THE CFPB HAS CONCEDED THAT ITS APPOINTMENT PROVISION IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  THE SUPREME COURT WAS PRESENTED WITH SIMILAR ARGUMENTS JUST A WEEK AGO FROM ANOTHER CFPB TARGET, THE PAYDAY LENDER ALL AMERICAN CHECK CASHING, IN A PETITION ASKING THE COURT TO HEAR ALL AMERICAN\u2019S CASE INSTEAD OF OR IN ADDITION TO THE SEILA LAW CASE. ALL AMERICAN\u2019S LAWYERS AT GIBSON DUNN & CRUTCHER ARGUED THAT SEILA\u2019S PETITION DOES NOT PRESENT THE QUESTION OF AN APPROPRIATE REMEDY; SEILA\u2019S LAWYERS AT PAUL WEISS RIFKIND WHARTON & GARRISON RESPONDED IN A BRIEF FRIDAY THAT ARGUES THE SEILA CASE IS AN IDEAL VEHICLE FOR BOTH THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND REMEDY QUESTIONS.  BOTH ALL AMERICAN IN LAST WEEK\u2019S SUPREME COURT PETITION AND OCWEN IN THE MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION ARGUED THAT THE SUPREME COURT WOULD ITSELF BE VIOLATING SEPARATION-OF-POWERS DOCTRINE IF IT WERE SIMPLY TO SEVER THE APPOINTMENT PROVISION OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ACT, WHICH IS ITSELF PART OF THE DODD-FRANK FINANCIAL REFORM LAW. CONGRESS CLEARLY INTENDED FOR THE CFPB DIRECTOR TO BE INSULATED FROM ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE PRESIDENT, THEY ARGUED, SO THE SUPREME COURT WOULD BE DEFYING LAWMAKERS\u2019 WILL IF IT WERE TO ATTEMPT TO REWRITE THE STATUTE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THE 5TH CIRCUIT RULED JUST LAST MONTH IN COLLINS V. FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY THAT THE CURE FOR A STATUTE THAT UNCONSTITUTIONALLY INSULATES THE HEAD OF A FEDERAL AGENCY IS SEVERANCE OF THE FLAWED APPOINTMENT PROVISION \u2013 NOT INVALIDATION OF ALL ACTIONS BY THE IMPROPERLY-APPOINTED DIRECTOR. (THE PLAINTIFFS WHO CHALLENGED THE FHFA\u2019S CONSTITUTIONALITY, SHAREHOLDERS OF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC, HAVE ASKED THE SUPREME COURT TO TAKE THEIR CASE TO DECIDE THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY.) IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT WHEN JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH SAT ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT, HE OPINED THAT SEVERING THE APPOINTMENT PROVISION WOULD REMEDY CONSTITUTIONAL FLAWS IN THE APPOINTMENT PROVISION.  IT\u2019S WAY TOO SOON TO PREDICT HOW THE SUPREME COURT WILL ULTIMATELY RESOLVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE CFPB\u2019S STRUCTURE IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND, IF SO, HOW TO FIX THE DEFECT. BUT IT\u2019S TIME FOR THE COURT TO TAKE ON THOSE QUESTIONS.", "Ticker": "OCN", "Date": "2019-10-07T00:00:00", "key": "20191007OCN", "labelr0": -9.793814432989688, "labelr1": 0.5714285714285721, "labelr2": 1.7045454545454561, "labelr3": -2.2346368715083806, "labelr4": 4.5714285714285765, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.185, "compound": -0.3612, "0_day_return": -9.79381443298969, "1_day_return": 0.5714285714285783, "2_day_return": 2.285714285714291, "3_day_return": 0.0, "4_day_return": 4.571428571428582, "label": 1, "return": -0.015560819042234431, "excess_return": 0.5869893904708127, "count_of_word": 967, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.35443443, "prof1": 0.64556557, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4849868928534691, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5150131071465309, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.35443443, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.64556557, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.3715874, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.6284126, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5576081, "tr_prof1": 0.44239187, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5286913000000001, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.4713087, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5077463, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.49225375, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.44072512, "headline_prof21": 0.5592749, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.27770224, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.7222978, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.5258834, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.47411656, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.8780375, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.12196244, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -0.5714285714285783, "returnpredvader": -0.5714285714285783, "returnpredsgd": 0.5714285714285783, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0108701655879098, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0168980427099432, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0092963740922436, "cumreturn1b": 2.596790856928494, "cumreturn1d": 1.3145558736425493, "cumreturn1e": 1.5915845391279069, "cumreturndow": 1.152599779912832, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1206960435923363}, {"Unnamed: 0": 12717, "Unnamed: 0.1": 12717, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 12717, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 12717, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 12717, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 12717, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12717, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12717, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12717, "level_0": 12717, "index": 12717, "text": "(REUTERS) - DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA (DPZ.N) SURPRISED INVESTORS BY RESETTING ITS LONG-TERM GROWTH GOALS ON TUESDAY AND SAID IT WOULD CUT COSTS AND INVESTMENT THIS YEAR AS IT BATTLES THE GROWING POPULARITY OF THIRD-PARTY DELIVERY SERVICES AND SMALL PIZZERIAS.

THE LAWSUIT CLAIMED EXXON FALSELY TOLD INVESTORS IT HAD PROPERLY EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF FUTURE CLIMATE REGULATIONS ON ITS BUSINESS USING A \u201cPROXY COST\u201d FOR THE LIKELY EFFECTS OF FUTURE EVENTS ON ITS BUSINESS.  HOWEVER, THESE PROXY FIGURES FREQUENTLY WERE NOT USED IN ITS INTERNAL PLANNING OR COST ASSUMPTIONS, ACCORDING TO THE LAWSUIT.  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ALSO ACCUSED THE COMPANY OF FAILING TO ACCOUNT PROPERLY FOR THE COSTS OF POTENTIAL REGULATION IN DETERMINING THE VALUE OF ITS OIL AND GAS RESERVES, OR WHETHER TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF ITS ASSETS.  MASSACHUSETTS IS SEPARATELY INVESTIGATING WHETHER EXXON CONCEALED ITS KNOWLEDGE OF THE ROLE FOSSIL FUELS PLAY IN CLIMATE CHANGE.  BOTH MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW YORK BEGAN INVESTIGATING EXXON AFTER NEWS REPORTS IN 2015 SAYING ITS OWN SCIENTISTS HAD DETERMINED THAT FOSSIL FUEL COMBUSTION MUST BE REDUCED TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE.  THOSE REPORTS, BY INSIDECLIMATE NEWS AND THE LOS ANGELES TIMES, WERE BASED ON DOCUMENTS FROM THE 1970S AND 1980S. EXXON SAID THE DOCUMENTS WERE NOT INCONSISTENT WITH ITS PUBLIC POSITIONS.  EXXON AND OTHER OIL COMPANIES INCLUDING BP PLC, CHEVRON CORP AND ROYAL DUTCH SHELL FACE LAWSUITS BY CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES SEEKING FUNDS TO PAY FOR SEAWALLS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE TO GUARD AGAINST RISING SEA LEVELS BROUGHT ON BY CLIMATE CHANGE.

FILE PHOTO: SPACEX OWNER AND TESLA CEO ELON MUSK SPEAKS DURING A CONVERSATION WITH LEGENDARY GAME DESIGNER TODD HOWARD (NOT PICTURED) AT THE E3 GAMING CONVENTION IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, U.S., JUNE 13, 2019. REUTERS/MIKE BLAKE/FILE PHOTO  WHETHER BILLIONAIRE ELON MUSK\u2019S FLAGSHIP COMPANY CAN START MASS PRODUCTION QUICKLY ENOUGH TO HIT STATED TARGETS IS THE QUESTION INVESTORS WILL WANT AN ANSWER TO WHEN TESLA ANNOUNCES THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS ON WEDNESDAY.  THE U.S. ELECTRIC VEHICLES MAKER IS UNDER PRESSURE TO RAMP UP OUTPUT GLOBALLY, AND THE SHANGHAI PLANT\u2019S PRODUCTION SCHEDULE IS CRUCIAL IF IT WANTS TO REACH ITS AMBITIOUS TARGET OF AN ANNUALIZED PRODUCTION RATE OF 500,000 VEHICLES BY THE END OF THE YEAR.  TESLA LAST WEEK OBTAINED THE CERTIFICATE IT NEEDS TO START MANUFACTURING CARS IN THE COUNTRY. BUT ANALYSTS CONTEND THAT UNCERTAINTIES AROUND LABOR AND SUPPLIERS MAKE IT A CHALLENGE TO START MASS PRODUCTION.  \u201cTHERE IS A LOT IN THE EQUATION THAT IS NOT IN THEIR CONTROL,\u201d SAID TU LE, ANALYST AT CHINA-BASED RESEARCH FIRM SINO AUTO INSIGHTS.  \u201cTHERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT JUST NEED TIME IN ORDER TO COMPLETE, LIKE QUALIFYING NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, A NEW BATTERY SUPPLIER, GETTING THE TOOLING SHIPPED AND SET UP, AS WELL AS SETTING UP ALL THE SUPPLIERS. ANY PARTS THAT HAVE TO BE IMPORTED NEED TO GO THROUGH CUSTOMS, WHICH ALSO COULD MEAN DELAYS,\u201d HE SAID.  TESLA IS ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING A KEY CERTIFICATION NEEDED TO SELL CHINA-MADE CARS IN THE COUNTRY, IT TOLD LOCAL MEDIA, THOUGH IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL GRANT IT SALES CLEARANCE.  TESLA DID NOT REPLY TO AN EMAIL SEEKING COMMENT.  IT SAID IN APRIL IT AIMS TO PRODUCE AT LEAST 1,000 MODEL 3 CARS A WEEK AT THE NEW FACTORY BY THE END OF THIS YEAR.  ANALYSTS, THOUGH, ARE DOUBTFUL THAT TESLA WILL HIT THIS TARGET, GIVEN ITS PATCHY PRODUCTION RECORD.  DELAYS AND QUALITY ISSUES HAVE MARRED THE LAUNCHES OF TESLA'S MODEL S AND MODEL X VEHICLES IN THE PAST, AND TESLA STRUGGLED TO START HERE MAKING THE MODEL 3 AT ITS CALIFORNIA FACTORY IN 2017.  THE COMPANY TOOK SIX MONTHS LONGER THAN ORIGINALLY FORECAST TO HIT A TARGET OF 5,000 MODEL 3 CARS PER WEEK, ACHIEVING THAT PACE ABOUT A YEAR AFTER LAUNCHING PRODUCTION.  STILL, TESLA IS TAKING STEPS TO ENSURE A SMOOTH LAUNCH OF PRODUCTION, INCLUDING TRYING TO DIVERSIFY ITS BATTERY SUPPLIER BASE, SOURCES HAVE SAID.  IT RECENTLY BOUGHT MAXWELL TECHNOLOGIES, WHOSE TECHNOLOGY COULD HELP THE CAR MAKER PRODUCE BATTERIES THAT LAST LONGER.  AT HIRING EVENTS IN SHANGHAI IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER, ATTENDED BY REUTERS JOURNALISTS, TESLA INTERVIEWED HUNDREDS OF CANDIDATES FROM MAINSTREAM CAR MAKERS IN CHINA.  IT ALSO ADVERTISED ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR BATTERY-RELATED PRODUCTION AND SOFTWARE SYSTEM ENGINEERS IN SHANGHAI, AND DELIVERY MANAGERS IN BIG CHINESE CITIES.  FURTHER LOSSES?  CHINA, FOR ITS PART, IS HELPING SPEED UP THINGS AT THE SHANGHAI FACTORY - THE COUNTRY\u2019S FIRST FULLY FOREIGN-OWNED CAR PLANT, A REFLECTION OF BEIJING\u2019S BROADER SHIFT TO OPEN UP ITS AUTO MARKET.  STATE-OWNED CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES HAVE ARRANGED EXTRA WORKFORCE AND BANKS ARE OFFERING CHEAP LOANS, WHILE THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WILL EXEMPT TESLA CARS FROM ITS PURCHASE TAX, A CONCESSION MADE AMIDST TRADE TENSIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES.  THE MODEL 3 HAS FARED WELL IN CHINA, THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST CAR MARKET.  TESLA SALES IN CHINA LIKELY SURGED MORE THAN THREE FOLD TO 10,542 CARS IN THE QUARTER ENDED SEPT. 30, ACCORDING TO RESEARCH FIRM LMC AUTOMOTIVE.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO DELIVER 360,000 TO 400,000 CARS THIS YEAR GLOBALLY.  SLIDESHOW (4 IMAGES)  ANALYSTS EXPECT TESLA\u2019S THIRD-QUARTER REVENUE TO DECLINE 7% FROM THE YEAR-AGO QUARTER, ACCORDING TO REFINITIV DATA. THEY PREDICT A LOSS OF 42 CENTS PER SHARE, EXCLUDING ONE-TIME ITEMS, IN CONTRAST TO MUSK\u2019S PROMISES THAT THE COMPANY WOULD BREAK EVEN IN THE QUARTER.  GROSS MARGINS LIKELY SHRANK TO 15.6% FROM 22.3%.  \u201cTHE BIGGEST OVERHANG AROUND THE STORY IS THE ABILITY TO HIT PROFITABILITY AND TO ACHIEVE ITS AMBITIOUS UNIT GUIDANCE FOR 2019,\u201d WEDBUSH ANALYST DAN IVES SAID IN A PRE-EARNINGS RESEARCH NOTE.", "Ticker": "TSLA", "Date": "2019-10-23T00:00:00", "key": "20191023TSLA", "labelr0": -0.3521402300649525, "labelr1": 17.669231977383387, "labelr2": 9.493459690336355, "labelr3": -0.12799804955353547, "labelr4": -3.5061487290592144, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.0, "0_day_return": -0.3521402300649568, "1_day_return": 17.669231977383394, "2_day_return": 28.84011308308465, "3_day_return": 28.675200251295728, "4_day_return": 24.16365635307054, "label": 1, "return": 0.0019204461816167387, "excess_return": 17.667311531201772, "count_of_word": 702, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5477603, "prof1": 0.45223975, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5579773418349987, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4420226581650013, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5477603, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.45223975, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.4519833, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.54801667, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5067604, "tr_prof1": 0.49323958, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.6485155, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.35148448, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5673609000000001, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.43263906, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.5705985, "headline_prof21": 0.42940152, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.44228733, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5577127, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.53297585, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.4670242, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.6500613000000001, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.3499387, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -17.669231977383394, "returnpredvader": -17.669231977383394, "returnpredsgd": -17.669231977383394, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0039347340576708, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9960475187098394, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9998348319386764, "cumreturn1b": 2.856581347171854, "cumreturn1d": 1.3026583464176409, "cumreturn1e": 1.603416582980546, "cumreturndow": 1.199304392465497, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1481732830780231}, {"Unnamed: 0": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13636, "level_0": 13636, "index": 13636, "text": "OCT 24 (REUTERS) -

REUTERS/ARND WIEGMANN  NEW YORK (REUTERS BREAKINGVIEWS) - ALPHABET STILL RUNS FAST, BUT ITS PACE IS SLOWING. IT\u2019S A COMMON PROBLEM THAT COMES WITH AGING. A POTENTIAL BID FOR DEVICE-MAKER FITBIT COULD BRING NEW YOUTHFUL ENERGY FOR THE $880 BILLION FIRM, OR JUST A SLIGHTLY EXPANDED WAISTLINE.  THE OWNER OF GOOGLE SHOWED ON MONDAY THAT ITS CORE BUSINESS OF SELLING ONLINE ADS STILL PUMPS OUT PROFIT. ALPHABET\u2019S REVENUE HIT $40.5 BILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE YEAR, AN INCREASE OF 20% FROM LAST YEAR. BUT THAT\u2019S LESS RAPID THAN ITS RATE A YEAR AGO. INTERNET ADVERTISING IS MATURING AND RIVAL AMAZON IS PUSHING HARD \u2013 THAT BUSINESS IS THE MAIN COMPONENT OF A PART OF JEFF BEZOS\u2019 E-COMMERCE GIANT THAT GREW OVER 40%.  THE OFFER FOR FITBIT THAT REUTERS REPORTED, CITING SOURCES, HAS SOME LOGIC. ALPHABET CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE LARRY PAGE HAS MADE PUSHES IN MOBILE DEVICES, SMART CONTACTS AND DELIVERING BROADBAND VIA BALLOON AMONG OTHERS. ACQUISITIONS PLAYED A PART IN SEVERAL OF THESE EFFORTS. WHILE SOME PROVED WILDLY SUCCESSFUL \u2013 ITS MOBILE AD BUSINESS SUCCESS CAN BE PINNED IN LARGE PART TO BUYING THE MAKER OF THE ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM \u2013 OTHERS, SUCH AS FIBER BROADBAND, HAVE BEEN DUDS.  HEALTHCARE IS AN AREA WHERE GOOGLE HAS HAD LITTLE VISIBLE SUCCESS. PERHAPS FITBIT\u2019S EXPERIENCE IN DESIGNING WEARABLES WILL HELP ALPHABET MAKE USEFUL DEVICES FOR HEART-RATE MONITORING OR GLUCOSE MONITORS. ALPHABET COULD BRING HEFT THAT FITBIT ON ITS OWN LACKS. THE STOCK IS DOWN 70% FROM ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING IN 2015, PARTLY DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF APPLE\u2019S WATCH.  GROWING SIDEWAYS BRINGS PITFALLS. AS WELL AS BEING A DISTRACTION, AN ALPHABET BID FOR FITBIT COULD DRAW POLITICAL SCRUTINY. DATA COLLECTED BY HEALTH TRACKERS IS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE IN THE EYES OF REGULATORS AND ANTITRUST WATCHDOGS HAVE SAID SUCH INFORMATION WOULD BECOME A MORE IMPORTANT PART OF MERGER REVIEWS. FITBIT IS ALSO A CONSUMER BRAND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE LIKELY TO UNDERSTAND, OR EVEN USE.  FITBIT IS TINY ENOUGH TO SWALLOW WHOLE \u2013 ITS MARKET CAPITALIZATION AT FRIDAY\u2019S CLOSE WAS JUST $1.1 BILLION \u2013 AND THE REVENUE POTENTIAL FROM DIVERSIFYING INTO HEALTHCARE AND MEDICAL TRACKING DEVICES IS LARGE.

FILE PHOTO: EMERSON ELECTRIC COMPANY CANADIAN HEADQUARTERS IS SHOWN IN MARKHAM, ONTARIO, FEBRUARY 7, 2012. REUTERS/MIKE CASSESE/FILE PHOTO  ITS PLANES ARRIVED AT GEORGIA\u2019S AUGUSTA REGIONAL AIRPORT FROM ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES, FLYING IN FROM AUSTIN, DALLAS, HOUSTON, NEW ORLEANS, NEW YORK AND THE INDUSTRIAL CONGLOMERATE\u2019S HOMETOWN OF ST. LOUIS, ACCORDING TO U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) RECORDS. BY THE TIME WOODS SEALED HIS FIFTH MASTERS VICTORY ON APRIL 14, EMERSON PILOTS HAD LANDED 13 TIMES AT THE AIRPORT DURING THE FOUR-DAY TOURNAMENT.  EMERSON, WHICH IS IN THE VITAL BUT UNGLAMOROUS BUSINESS OF MAKING PRODUCTS SUCH AS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL SYSTEMS USED BY MANUFACTURING COMPANIES, IS NOW TAKING HEAT OVER ITS OWNERSHIP OF EIGHT AIRCRAFT. THE FLEET CONSISTS OF SEVEN JETS AND ONE HELICOPTER, ACCORDING TO ST. LOUIS COUNTY ASSESSOR RECORDS.  HEDGE FUND D.E. SHAW, WHICH OWNS MORE THAN 1% OF THE COMPANY, EARLIER THIS MONTH WROTE TO EMERSON\u2019S BOARD AND SPOTLIGHTED THE \u201cGREAT EXPENSE TO SHAREHOLDERS\u201d OF ITS CORPORATE JETS, SEEING THEM AS EMBLEMATIC OF A \u201cBLOATED STRUCTURE AND EXPENSE BASE.\u201d THE FUND IS AGITATING FOR BIG CHANGES AT EMERSON, INCLUDING SPLITTING IT IN TWO, AND IS SEEKING SUPPORT FROM OTHER SHAREHOLDERS.  ITS CASE IS THAT EMERSON\u2019S STOCK HAS LAGGED BADLY, PARTLY BECAUSE OF ELEVATED COSTS. ITS SHARES ROSE 12% IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS, A PERIOD IN WHICH THE S&P 500 GAINED 53%. IN THE THREE FISCAL YEARS ENDING IN 2016 TO 2018, EMERSON\u2019S SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES SURGED 23% BUT ITS NET SALES ROSE ONLY 20%.  SOON AFTER D.E. SHAW\u2019S CAMPAIGN BECAME PUBLIC IN A REUTERS STORY ON SEPT. 27, EMERSON ANNOUNCED A REVIEW OF ITS OPERATIONS. AVIATION COSTS WILL BE PART OF THAT.  THE COMPANY, WHICH EMPLOYED 87,500 PEOPLE IN 2018, DECLINED TO ANSWER REUTERS\u2019 QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS AIRCRAFT. A SPOKESWOMAN DECLINED TO SAY WHO WAS FERRIED TO AUGUSTA AND OTHER DESTINATIONS, AND WHETHER PEOPLE WERE BEING TAKEN TO THE TOURNAMENT OR WERE TRAVELING FOR SOME OTHER REASON. EMERSON HAS A SOUTH CAROLINA FACILITY NEAR AUGUSTA.  THE SIZE OF THE FLEET AND THE NUMBER OF TIMES EMERSON\u2019S CHIEF EXECUTIVE DAVID FARR USES THE PLANES FOR PERSONAL TRIPS IS OUT OF STEP WITH MOST MAJOR U.S. COMPANIES. SOME OTHERS HAVE SOLD THEIR JETS, AND THOSE RETAINING THEM HAVE SMALLER FLEETS THAN EMERSON, NATIONAL BUSINESS AVIATION ASSOCIATION DATA SHOW.  A REUTERS ANALYSIS OF FAA RECORDS SHOWS THAT EMERSON\u2019S PLANES HAVE MADE 260 FLIGHTS IN THE PAST 90 DAYS. THIS MONTH ALONE, THE JETS WERE TRACKED IN ALASKA, CALIFORNIA, CHINA AND NEW YORK. THERE ALSO HAVE BEEN RECENT TRIPS TO BOSTON, MINNEAPOLIS, NEW DELHI, JAPAN AND WASHINGTON, D.C.  THE INTENSITY OF THE FLYING, AND OTHER DETAILS ABOUT HOW EMERSON\u2019S AVIATION ARM OPERATES, HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED. THE INFORMATION IS GATHERED FROM FLIGHT AND LOCAL AUTHORITY RECORDS AS WELL AS FROM INTERVIEWS WITH FORMER STAFF AT THE OPERATION.  SECURITY ARGUMENT  CERTAINLY EMERSON EXECUTIVES DO NEED TO TRAVEL AS THE COMPANY HAS MORE THAN 200 MANUFACTURING SITES AND MORE THAN HALF ITS SALES ARE ABROAD, BUT IT IS THE WAY THEY DO IT THAT HAS SPARKED QUESTIONS AMONG INVESTORS.  IN ITS ANNUAL PROXY STATEMENT, EMERSON SAYS IT REQUIRES FARR TO USE THE COMPANY\u2019S AIRCRAFT FOR ALL HIS TRAVEL, INCLUDING PERSONAL TRIPS, \u201cTO PROMOTE BUSINESS EFFICIENCY AND SAFETY.\u201d  THIS REASONING IS CHALLENGED BY CORPORATE GOVERNANCE EXPERT JONATHAN MACEY, A YALE LAW SCHOOL PROFESSOR. GIVEN TIGHT SECURITY AT MOST AIRPORTS THAT ARGUMENT \u201cIS JUST BALDERDASH,\u201d HE SAID.  PRIVATE AVIATION BUSINESS EXPERTS COUNTER THAT SECURITY IS AN ISSUE NOT JUST FOR THE EXECUTIVE BUT FOR THE THINGS THEY MAY BE WORKING ON OR DISCUSSING WHILE TRAVELING. ON A PRIVATE PLANE \u201cTHEY DON\u2019T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANYONE LISTENING IN ON THEIR BUSINESS DEALINGS,\u201d SAID SHERPAREPORT\u2019S NICK COPLEY, WHO ANALYSES THE PRIVATE AVIATION INDUSTRY.  DOG ON HIS LAP  LUXURY JET FLYING CAN BE A FAMILY AFFAIR FOR THE CEO.  PHOTOGRAPHS POSTED ON THE FACEBOOK PAGE OF HIS SON ANDREW IN AUGUST 2007 SHOW FARR FLYING WITH A SMALL BROWN DOG ON HIS LAP. HIS SON AND A HANDFUL OF HIS SON\u2019S FRIENDS, TEENAGERS AT THE TIME, ARE PICTURED SITTING IN A JET\u2019S PLUSH CHAIRS EATING PASTRIES.  IN THE FISCAL YEAR TO SEPTEMBER 2018, EMERSON ESTIMATED FARR\u2019S PERSONAL JET TRAVEL COST IT $369,000, ACCORDING TO A FILING. IT SAID HE REIMBURSES THE COMPANY FOR PERSONAL TRIPS BASED ON FIRST-CLASS TICKET PRICES, BUT EMERSON DOES NOT DISCLOSE HOW MUCH HE PAYS.  THE COST WAS HIGHER THAN FOR CEOS AT MANY OTHER MANUFACTURING COMPANIES. MICHAEL ROMAN, THE CEO OF 3M CO (MMM.N), WHOSE SALES ARE ALMOST DOUBLE EMERSON\u2019S, COST HIS COMPANY $56,743 IN PERSONAL AIRCRAFT USE LAST YEAR.  THE FANCIEST JET IN EMERSON\u2019S FLEET IS A 2013 DASSAULT FALCON 7X, WHICH IT BOUGHT LAST YEAR FOR AN UNDISCLOSED SUM. THE PRICE TAG FOR THE PLANE, WHICH SEATS UP TO 16 AND CAN BE EQUIPPED WITH AN ON-BOARD SHOWER, WOULD BE BETWEEN $25 MILLION AND $30 MILLION, ACCORDING TO SHERPAREPORT.COM.  EMERSON EMPLOYS ENOUGH STAFF TO RUN A SMALL AIRLINE, INCLUDING PILOTS, SCHEDULERS, HANGAR SECURITY, AND AT LEAST ONE SUMMER INTERN, ACCORDING TO FORMER EMPLOYEES AND LINKEDIN PAGES OF CURRENT EMPLOYEES. ANNUAL COSTS FOR OPERATING THE FLEET ARE ESTIMATED TO BE $20 MILLION TO $25 MILLION, ACCORDING TO LIBERTY JET MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPENSE CALCULATOR. THAT EXCLUDES COSTS OF BUYING THE PLANES.  THE AUGUSTA TRIPS ALONE WOULD LIKELY HAVE COST $120,000, COPLEY ESTIMATES.  EXPENSES INCLUDE $61,122 EMERSON PAID IN REAL ESTATE TAXES FOR ITS HANGAR, AND PROPERTY TAXES OF $112,000 FOR THE JETS, LOCAL TAX RECORDS SHOW.  COUNTRY RETREAT  BOTH EMERSON\u2019S ST. LOUIS HEADQUARTERS AND ITS CORPORATE RETREAT SOME 40 MILES (64 KM) AWAY IN WINFIELD, MISSOURI, HAVE HELIPADS.  PHOTOGRAPHS POSTED BY EMERSON PILOTS ON FACEBOOK SHOW THE COMPANY\u2019S BELL 412 HELICOPTER, IDENTIFIABLE BY ITS TAIL NUMBER, AT WINFIELD. THE RETREAT HAS A CONFERENCE CENTER, A TENNIS COURT AND SWIMMING POOL ON MORE THAN 400 ACRES, ACCORDING TO THE COUNTY ASSESSOR AND REAL ESTATE RECORDS.  EMERSON\u2019S TIES TO AUGUSTA, THE EXCLUSIVE GOLF CLUB, DATE BACK TO FARR\u2019S PREDECESSOR, CHARLES KNIGHT, WHO WAS ONE OF ONLY ABOUT 300 MEMBERS.  FARR IS AN AVID GOLFER. HE TOLD FORBES IN MARCH HE HAD \u201cDRAGGED EVERYONE FROM MY WIFE TO FRIENDS AND EMERSON COLLEAGUES FOR A ROUND,\u201d IN THE UNITED STATES, IRELAND AND SCOTLAND. NEITHER EMERSON NOR THE CLUB WOULD COMMENT ON WHETHER HE BELONGS TO AUGUSTA.  THE CORPORATE JET\u2019S HEYDAY WAS IN THE 1980S WHEN TOBACCO-TO-FOOD CONGLOMERATE RJR NABISCO HAD 10. THE BOOK \u201cBARBARIANS AT THE GATE: THE FALL OF RJR NABISCO\u201d DETAILS HOW ONE JET WAS FLOWN ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WITH THE CEO\u2019S DOG AS THE KEY PASSENGER.  BY 2008, AT THE HEIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, ATTITUDES WERE VERY DIFFERENT. CEOS OF U.S. AUTO COMPANIES WERE CRITICIZED BY LAWMAKERS FOR TRAVELING BY CORPORATE JET WHEN THEY WERE SEEKING A BAILOUT FROM THE GOVERNMENT.  SLIDESHOW (3 IMAGES)  EVEN ST.

ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM THE 15 STATES AND WASHINGTON, D.C. CONTEND THAT THE MERGER WILL BOOST PRICES AND HARM CONSUMERS, ESPECIALLY POORER ONES. POMERANTZ AND HIS FIRM REPRESENT CALIFORNIA, THE LARGEST OF THE 15 STATES.  LEHRBURGER SAID THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT KNEW IN MID-APRIL ABOUT POMERANTZ\u2019S PLANNED ROLE AND SHOULD NOT HAVE WAITED UNTIL A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE SCHEDULED TRIAL - AND AFTER THE ORIGINAL OCT. 7 TRIAL DATE - TO SPEAK UP.  \u201cTHE DIVISION COULD HAVE, AND SHOULD HAVE, MOVED MUCH EARLIER,\u201d LEHRBURGER SAID, REFERRING TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT\u2019S ANTITRUST DIVISION.  LEHRBURGER, WHO HANDLES MANY PRE-TRIAL MATTERS IN THE CASE FOR U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE VICTOR MARRERO, SAID DISQUALIFYING THE STATES\u2019 LAWYERS WOULD CAUSE \u201cEXTREME PREJUDICE\u201d TO BOTH SIDES IN A \u201cVERY COMPLEX\u201d MERGER CASE.  HE ALSO SAID IT WOULD PREJUDICE THE PUBLIC, WHO HAD AN INTEREST IN SEEING A RESOLUTION \u201cSOONER RATHER THAN LATER.\u201d  LAWRENCE REICHER, A LAWYER FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, HAD ARGUED THAT THERE WAS A \u201cSUBSTANTIAL RELATIONSHIP\u201d BETWEEN POMERANTZ\u2019S WORK IN 2011, WHEN HE HAD ACCESS TO THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S FILES, AND THE CURRENT CASE.  \u201cTHE UNITED STATES\u2019 PARAMOUNT INTEREST IS PRESERVING OUR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION,\u201d HE SAID.  T-MOBILE\u2019S PURCHASE OF SPRINT HAS WON CONDITIONAL APPROVAL BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION.  THAT APPROVAL REQUIRES THE COMPANIES TO DIVEST SPRINT\u2019S PREPAID BUSINESSES, INCLUDING BOOST MOBILE, TO SATELLITE TELEVISION COMPANY DISH NETWORK CORP (DISH.O) AND PROVIDE IT ACCESS TO 20,000 CELL SITES AND HUNDREDS OF RETAIL LOCATIONS. THAT TRANSACTION IS WORTH ABOUT $5 BILLION.

THE U.S. SPACE AGENCY IS FORMING AN INVESTIGATIVE TEAM TO DETERMINE WHAT CAUSED THE TIMER GLITCH AND \u201cANY OTHER SOFTWARE ISSUES,\u201d NASA SAID.

DOCKING WAS A KEY REQUIREMENT FOR THE TEST UNDER BOEING\u2019S CONTRACT.  \u201cALTHOUGH DATA FROM THE UNCREWED TEST IS IMPORTANT FOR CERTIFICATION, IT MAY NOT BE THE ONLY WAY THAT BOEING IS ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE ITS SYSTEM\u2019S FULL CAPABILITIES,\u201d THE AGENCY SAID.

SOURCES FROM THREE INTERNATIONAL BANKS FEAR THAT ACCESS WILL DEPEND ON A BROADER TRADE-OFF SUCH AS BRITAIN ALLOWING FISHING IN ITS WATERS \u2014 A CONCESSION THEY FEEL THE GOVERNMENT IS RELUCTANT TO MAKE.  \u201cWE\u2019RE NOW HEARING VERY EXPLICITLY \u2014 IT\u2019S NOT EVEN THE RUMOUR MILL \u2014 THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS SAID THESE ARE POLITICALLY LINKED TO PROGRESS IN PHASE-TWO NEGOTIATIONS,\u201d ONE BANKING SOURCE TOLD REUTERS.  \u201cAS ONE OFFICIAL PUT IT TO ME, IF \u2018FISH FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES\u2019 IS GOING BADLY, THIS WILL IMPACT THE COMMISSION\u2019S WILLINGNESS TO GRANT EQUIVALENCE.\u201d  THE FISHING INDUSTRY IS VALUED AT ABOUT 169 TIMES LESS THAN FINANCIAL SERVICES AND OFFICIAL DATA SHOWS IT EMPLOYS JUST 8,000 PEOPLE COMPARED TO MORE THAN A MILLION IN FINANCE.  BUT REGAINING CONTROL OF BRITAIN\u2019S RICH FISHING WATERS WAS A TOTEM FOR BREXIT CAMPAIGNERS.  A EUROPEAN COMMISSION SPOKESMAN REFERRED TO A JANUARY EU DOCUMENT SAYING THE BLOC AND BRITAIN SHOULD ENDEAVOUR TO COMPLETE EQUIVALENCE ASSESSMENTS BEFORE JUNE 30. HE DECLINED TO COMMENT FURTHER.  THE EU IS BRITAIN\u2019S BIGGEST FINANCIAL SERVICES EXPORT MARKET, WORTH ABOUT 26 BILLION POUNDS ANNUALLY.  SINCE THE 2016 BREXIT VOTE, THE SECTOR HAS REORGANISED TO PRESERVE A FOOTHOLD IN THE EU, LAUNCHING OR BEEFING UP SUBSIDIARIES AND RELOCATING STAFF AND CAPITAL. MANY BANKS AND MONEY MANAGERS ARE PREPARING FOR A FURTHER TRANSFER OF RESOURCES AFTER A TRANSITION PERIOD ENDS IN DECEMBER.  CONSULTANTS EY SAID THIS WEEK THAT AROUND 7,000 FINANCIAL SERVICES JOBS WILL MOVE FROM BRITAIN TO STAFF NEW EU HUBS.  FAILING TO OBTAIN EQUIVALENCE COULD ADD RISK-MANAGEMENT, COMPLIANCE, MIDDLE AND BACK OFFICE ROLES TO THAT FIGURE, AS WELL AS TRADING AND CLIENT-FACING JOBS, THE SOURCES SAID.  FINANCE MINISTER SAJID JAVID SAID LAST WEEK THAT BRITAIN WOULD NOT BE A RULE-TAKER AFTER BREXIT, EVEN THOUGH SOME BUSINESSES COULD SUFFER FROM REGULATORY DIVERGENCE.  HE WANTS \u201cOUTCOMES-BASED\u201d EQUIVALENCE IN FINANCIAL SERVICES, MEANING UK RULES NEED NOT BE IDENTICAL TO THOSE IN THE EU BUT SHOULD HAVE THE SAME EFFECT.  THE EU UPDATED ITS EQUIVALENCE POLICY AHEAD OF BREXIT, SAYING THIRD-COUNTRY REGIMES LIKE THOSE IN JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES DO NOT NEED TO BE IDENTICAL BUT MUST HAVE THE SAME \u201cOUTCOMES\u201d AS EU RULES TO GIVE ACCESS TO ITS MARKETS.  BUT IT WOULD IMPOSE TOUGHER SCRUTINY OF \u201cHIGH-IMPACT\u201d COUNTRIES, EXPECTED TO INCLUDE BRITAIN.  THE EU\u2019S WITHDRAWAL OF SHARE TRADING EQUIVALENCE FROM SWITZERLAND DURING A DISPUTE OVER A PARTNERSHIP TREATY, NOT BECAUSE OF ANY DIVERGENCE IN RULES, SHOWED HOW EQUIVALENCE CAN BE POLITICISED.  BRITAIN\u2019S FINANCE MINISTRY HAD NO IMMEDIATE COMMENT.  COST AND SCRUTINY  BANKERS SAY JOBS TRANSFERRED TO EUROPE AS POLITICIANS WRANGLE ARE LIKELY TO STAY THERE, EVEN IF EQUIVALENCE IS EVENTUALLY GRANTED.  \u201cTHE SECTOR\u2019S APPROACH HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO PREPARE IN A WAY FOR THE WORST,\u201d A SECOND SENIOR BANKING SOURCE SAID.  SPEAKING AT THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM IN DAVOS THIS WEEK, DEUTSCHE BANK CEO CHRISTIAN SEWING RECOGNISED THE RISK THAT A TRADE DEAL WOULD NOT BE FINALISED BEFORE END-2020.  HE SAID HIS BANK \u201cCOULD DO EVERYTHING OUT OF FRANKFURT\u201d BUT THAT BRITAIN WOULD REMAIN AN IMPORTANT CAPITAL MARKET.  FINANCIAL LOBBY GROUPS HAVE WARNED THAT IF BRITAIN DOES NOT GET EQUIVALENCE, THE GOVERNMENT WILL LOSE VALUABLE TAX REVENUE.  THE BLOC IS THE BIGGEST CUSTOMER FOR BRITAIN\u2019S FINANCIAL SERVICES EXPORTS, WORTH ABOUT 26 BILLION POUNDS ANNUALLY BASED ON UNFETTERED ACCESS.  BUT LAWMAKERS FROM JOHNSON\u2019S CONSERVATIVE PARTY SAY THE CITY COULD COPE WITH THE FALLOUT IF NEGOTIATIONS TURNED SOUR.  \u201cLONDON IS A MARKETPLACE. THE MARKETPLACE DOESN\u2019T COME TO THEM (THE EU) ... THE HEALTH OF THE CITY DOESN\u2019T DEPEND NEARLY TO THE EXTENT THAT IS BELIEVED ON HAVING SOME PRIVILEGED POSITION IN THE EU,\u201d SAID PETER LILLEY, WHO SITS IN PARLIAMENT\u2019S UPPER CHAMBER.  A SECOND CONSERVATIVE LAWMAKER, TIM LOUGHTON, SAID JOHNSON WOULD NOT CONSIDER SWAPPING ASSETS SUCH AS FISHING RIGHTS TO CUT A BETTER DEAL FOR BANKS, WHICH HAVE STRUGGLED TO REBUILD THEIR IMAGE SINCE THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS.  HE SAID THE EU WAS BLUFFING AND WOULD NOT POLITICIZE FINANCIAL SERVICES BECAUSE IT, TOO, RISKED LOSING ACCESS TO THE REGION\u2019S DEEPEST MARKETS.  \u201cIT WOULD BE A MASSIVE EXERCISE IN CUTTING OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE,\u201d HE SAID.

THE TWO COMPANIES WERE BOTH WORTH ROUGHLY $220 BILLION WHEN ROMETTY TOOK CHARGE OF IBM. ONE OF HER RECENT STRATEGIC MOVES EVEN ECHOES THOSE OF FORMER MICROSOFT BOSS STEVE BALLMER. HE PAID WAY ABOVE THE ODDS FOR A COUPLE OF COMPANIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO LEAVE BEHIND THE COMPANY\u2019S STODGY IMAGE - BEFORE BEING EFFECTIVELY FORCED OUT IN 2014.

THE FATE OF FINNISH TELECOM COMPANY NOKIA PROVIDES AN INSTRUMENTAL LESSON ON HOW TURNAROUND ATTEMPTS CAN SPIRAL DOWN. IT WAS ONCE, LIKE IBM, A DOMINANT HARDWARE MAKER BEFORE FALLING ON HARD TIMES. IT SOLD PART OF ITS BUSINESS TO MICROSOFT \u2013 ONE OF BALLMER\u2019S BAD DEALS \u2013 AND SHARES IN THE REST NOW TRADE AT JUST 6% OF THEIR MARKET HIGH IN 2000. YAHOO IS ANOTHER TALE OF WOE.

THAT HAS LEFT IT WITH A MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF ABOUT $49 BILLION, BELOW TESLA\u2019S VALUATION OF ABOUT $130 BILLION.  \u201cTHE MARKET\u2019S GOT IT WRONG,\u201d SAID CHRIS SUSANIN, CO-PORTFOLIO MANAGER WITH LEVIN EASTERLY PARTNERS, WHICH OWNS SHARES IN GM BUT NOT TESLA. \u201cGM SHOULD BE THE $150 BILLION MARKET CAP, NOT TESLA.\u201d  THE BULK OF GM\u2019S PROFITS IS STILL DERIVED FROM THE FUEL-HUNGRY PICKUP TRUCKS AND SUVS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES. THE CHINESE MARKET HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF A STEADY $2 BILLION IN PROFITS A YEAR, BUT THAT IS THREATENED BY A MARKET SLOWDOWN, RISING COSTS FOR ELECTRIFICATION AND NOW THE DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK.  WHILE CHINA WILL DELIVER LOWER EQUITY INCOME TO GM IN THE NEAR TERM, IT REMAINS A SOLID CONTRIBUTOR THAT IS PROFITABLE AND DIVIDEND PAYING, AND WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVS GLOBALLY, OFFICIALS SAID. GM ALSO SEES GROWTH FOR ITS CADILLAC BRAND IN CHINA.  \u2018HAVE OUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO\u2019  BARRA\u2019S CHALLENGE NOW IS TO ASSURE INVESTORS THAT GM CAN MAKE THE LEAP ACROSS THE GAP SEPARATING ITS PROFITABLE INTERNAL COMBUSTION PRESENT AND AN UNCERTAIN ELECTRIC FUTURE.  WHILE GASOLINE-POWERED VEHICLES WILL MAKE UP A LARGE PORTION OF U.S. SALES INTO THE 2030S, GM HAS SAID IT WILL SPEND MORE ON DEVELOPING ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAN THOSE WITH INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.  GM LAID OUT A MORE DETAILED PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVS AND SELF-DRIVING VEHICLES AT THE INVESTOR DAY, INCLUDING ITS CRUISE SELF-DRIVING UNIT.  SOME ANALYSTS HAVE SUGGESTED GM SHOULD SPIN OFF CRUISE, BUT SURYADEVARA SAID GM HAS NO PLANS TO DO THAT. SHE ADDED THAT SPENDING IN 2020 ON THAT BUSINESS WILL ROUGHLY MATCH LAST YEAR\u2019S $800 MILLION.  CRUISE CEO DAN AMMANN SAID THE SELF-DRIVING MARKET OPPORTUNITY TOTALS $8 TRILLION.  ONE OF THE AUDIENCES FOR THE INVESTOR DAY IS POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES AS GM COMPETES WITH TESLA AND OTHER AUTOMAKERS GLOBALLY TO HIRE TOP ENGINEERS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS OUTSIDE OF DETROIT, HIGHLIGHTING TECHNICAL CENTERS IN ONTARIO AND ISRAEL.  BARRA, ASKED WHETHER TESLA\u2019S EVENTUAL ELECTRIC PICKUP OFFERING COULD SQUEEZE GM\u2019S MARGINS, SAID HER COMPANY UNDERSTANDS THAT BUSINESS. \u201cI THINK WE CAN HAVE OUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO,\u201d SHE SAID.  GM ALSO SAID IT WILL OFFER ITS SUPERCRUISE PARTIALLY AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEM ON 22 MODELS BY THE END OF 2023, GM PRESIDENT MARK REUSS SAID.  GM ALSO LAID OUT ITS PLAN TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING COMPLEXITY THIS YEAR BY ELIMINATING 25% OF THE PARTS USED IN ITS PLANTS. BARRA ALSO SAID GM TARGETS SOURCING ALL OF ITS GLOBAL ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES BY 2040, A DECADE SOONER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROMISED.  IN DECEMBER, GM AND SOUTH KOREA\u2019S LG CHEM (051910.KS) SAID THEY WOULD INVEST $2.3 BILLION TO BUILD AN EV BATTERY CELL JOINT VENTURE PLANT IN OHIO, CREATING ONE OF THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST BATTERY FACILITIES.  THAT SAME MONTH, GM\u2019S CADILLAC CHIEF SAID MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE VEHICLES OFFERED BY THE LUXURY BRAND WOULD BE ELECTRIC BY 2030.  GM SAID LAST WEEK IT WOULD INVEST $2.2 BILLION IN ITS DETROIT-HAMTRAMCK ASSEMBLY PLANT TO BUILD ELECTRIC TRUCKS AND SUVS.", "Ticker": "TSLA", "Date": "2020-02-05T00:00:00", "key": "20200205TSLA", "labelr0": -17.1758392893378, "labelr1": 1.9409282700421928, "labelr2": -0.11883144627216224, "labelr3": 3.10265082144718, "labelr4": 0.4019292604501637, "pos": 0.166, "neg": 0.124, "compound": 0.1779, "0_day_return": -17.1758392893378, "1_day_return": 1.9409282700421968, "2_day_return": 1.8197903906356447, "3_day_return": 4.978902953586495, "4_day_return": 5.400843881856551, "label": 1, "return": 0.0033256729099900213, "excess_return": 1.9376025971322068, "count_of_word": 720, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5711542, "prof1": 0.42884579999999994, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5323693955729087, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4676306044270913, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5711542, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.42884579999999994, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.47983965, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.5201604000000001, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.44776928, "tr_prof1": 0.55223066, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5174215999999999, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.48257843, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5267430000000001, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.47325698, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.47334966, "headline_prof21": 0.52665037, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.38206244, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.6179375, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.627586, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.37241405, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.6676486, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.33235145, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": 1.9409282700421968, "returnpredvader": 1.9409282700421968, "returnpredsgd": -1.9409282700421968, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.009934731184296, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9926798176263002, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0065645527641909, "cumreturn1b": 4.83865645782581, "cumreturn1d": 1.2236209466243868, "cumreturn1e": 2.0769488980983697, "cumreturndow": 1.3329641439919193, "cumreturnsp500": 1.2584368719128132}, {"Unnamed: 0": 18212, "Unnamed: 0.1": 18212, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 18212, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 18212, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 18212, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 18212, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 18212, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 18212, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 18212, "level_0": 18212, "index": 18212, "text": "FEB 6 (REUTERS) -

RALPH HAMERS\u2019 APPOINTMENT HERALDS A SHIFT IN FOCUS FOR THE SWISS BANK, WHICH HISTORICALLY RELIED ON ITS BANKERS\u2019 PERSONAL ATTENTION TO CUSTOMERS TO BUILD A GROUP MANAGING MORE THAN $2 TRILLION OF INVESTMENTS.  ING, BY CONTRAST, IS BETTER KNOWN FOR ITS BRASH ORANGE LOGO, MOBILE APPS AND ONLINE LOAN APPLICATIONS.  ROCK-BOTTOM BORROWING RATES FOLLOWING THE FINANCIAL CRASH A DECADE AGO HAVE TURNED THE TRADITIONAL MODEL OF BANKING ON ITS HEAD, UPPING PRESSURE ON LENDERS TO ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGY TO CUT THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS.  UBS CHAIRMAN AXEL WEBER HAILED HAMERS\u2019 ARRIVAL AS THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT CHAPTER FOR THE SWISS BANK.  \u201cUNDER HIS LEADERSHIP ING IMPLEMENTED A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN ITS OPERATING MODEL AND IS NOW CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF DIGITAL INNOVATION IN THE BANKING SECTOR,\u201d WEBER TOLD JOURNALISTS.

UBS SHARES HAVE FALLEN OVER THE PAST YEAR, HIT BY A 4.5 BILLION EURO ($4.9 BILLION) FINE IN A FRENCH TAX FRAUD CASE.  WEBER SAID THE HUNT FOR ERMOTTI\u2019S SUCCESSOR BEGAN IN EARNEST 15 MONTHS AGO. HAMERS\u2019 APPOINTMENT DERAILS SPECULATION THAT STAR WEALTH MANAGER IQBAL KHAN, WHO JOINED LAST YEAR FROM RIVAL CREDIT SUISSE (CSGN.S), COULD BE IN LINE TO REPLACE ERMOTTI.  UBS IS OVERHAULING ITS FLAGSHIP WEALTH MANAGEMENT BUSINESS, INCLUDING SHRINKING ITS SENIOR STAFF NUMBERS, IN THE FIRST BIG STRATEGIC MOVE UNDER THE DIVISION\u2019S CO-HEAD KHAN.  DURING HIS STINT AS ING CEO, HAMERS STEERED THE LENDER TO PROFITABILITY WHILE REPAYING THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT MONEY IT RECEIVED DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.  UNDER HIS WATCH, THE BANK HAS ALSO INVESTED HEAVILY IN ITS DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, RELYING FAR MORE ON ITS ONLINE OFFERING AND LESS ON ITS BRANCH NETWORK THAN MOST RIVALS, LEADING TO ING HAVING ONE OF THE LOWEST COST-TO-REVENUE RATIOS IN EUROPE.  HE WAS, HOWEVER, CRITICIZED AFTER THE BANK ADMITTED CRIMINALS HAD BEEN ABLE TO LAUNDER MONEY THROUGH ITS ACCOUNTS, PAYING A $900 MILLION PENALTY.

THE FACT WE NOW HAVE A $1.4 TRILLION WEALTH BUSINESS SHOULD BE EXCITING FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND HOPEFULLY SCARY FOR OUR COMPETITORS,\u201d NUNN SAID.  NUNN IS ALREADY MAKING MANAGEMENT CHANGES.  HSBC NAMED KEVIN MARTIN, HEAD OF ASIA PACIFIC RETAIL BANKING AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT, AS THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF THE NEW GLOBAL WEALTH AND PERSONAL BANKING BUSINESS, REUTERS REPORTED ON THURSDAY.  THE WEALTH AND PERSONAL BANKING DIVISION COMBINED TWO OF HSBC\u2019S BETTER-PERFORMING BUSINESSES IN 2019, GROWING ADJUSTED PROFITS BY 19% AND 15% RESPECTIVELY.  CHINESE DIASPORA  AS PART OF ITS ASIA EXPANSION HSBC HAS HIRED SOME 800 FRONTLINE AND SUPPORT STAFF IN WEALTH MANAGEMENT SINCE 2017, NUNN SAID, MAINLY PRODUCT SPECIALISTS AND RELATIONSHIP MANAGERS FOR ITS PRIVATE BANK AND \u2018JADE\u2019 OFFERING FOR THOSE WITH ASSETS OF $1 MILLION-$5 MILLION.  \u201cWE REMAIN COMMITTED TO REALLY TRYING TO CAPTURE SHARE AND BE MORE RELEVANT IN THE GREATER BAY AREA OF CHINA,\u201d NUNN SAID.  IN AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE LENDER IS TARGETING THE GLOBAL CHINESE DIASPORA, HSBC HAS LAUNCHED AN INTERNATIONAL PAYMENT SYSTEM ALLOWING MAINLAND CHINESE CUSTOMERS TO PAY UNIVERSITY FEES DIRECTLY, IN RENMINBI, ACROSS 1,700 INSTITUTIONS WORLDWIDE.  HSBC INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE NOEL QUINN SAID ON TUESDAY THE BANK IS COMBINING WEALTH AND PERSONAL BANKING SO IT CAN BOOST PROFITS FROM THE TRANSFER OF PRODUCTS AND INVESTMENT BETWEEN THE TWO.  HSBC WILL AIM TO EXPAND A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST ASSET MANAGER BLACKROCK INC (BLK.N), TO USE ITS ALADDIN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE IN MORE MARKETS.  THE BANK WILL ALSO EXTEND ITS LOMBARD LENDING PRODUCT WHICH ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO BORROW AGAINST ASSETS THEY HOLD WITH THE BANK, FOR EXAMPLE TO BUY PROPERTY FOR A FAMILY MEMBER.  TOUGH COMPETITION  HSBC WILL FACE A TOUGH CHALLENGE IN ITS TARGET MARKETS, HOWEVER, WITH DOMESTIC PLAYERS DOMINATING RETAIL BANKING IN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA AND GLOBAL GIANTS SUCH AS UBS (UBSG.S) RULING THE MARKET FOR WEALTHIER CLIENTS.  WHILE HSBC\u2019S BRITISH AND HONG KONG RETAIL BANKING BUSINESSES HAVE POWERED ITS PROFITS IN RECENT YEARS, IN OTHER MARKETS SUCH AS FRANCE ITS SUB-SCALE HIGH STREET BANKING PRESENCE HAS BEEN A DRAG ON EARNINGS.  SLIDESHOW (2 IMAGES)  THE LENDER IS ATTEMPTING TO SELL THAT BUSINESS, REUTERS HAS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED. NUNN DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE PROGRESS OF THAT STRATEGIC REVIEW BUT SAID A DECISION WILL BE MADE IN 1-2 MONTHS.  HE ALSO DECLINED TO COMMENT ON OTHER MARKETS SUCH AS TURKEY, GREECE AND OMAN, PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BY REUTERS AS EARMARKED FOR EXIT.  \u201cWE\u2019LL CONTINUE TO REVIEW MARKETS ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS,\u201d NUNN SAID.", "Ticker": "HSBC", "Date": "2020-02-25T00:00:00", "key": "20200225HSBC", "labelr0": -1.915492957746478, "labelr1": 2.441125789775995, "labelr2": -5.186431174656578, "labelr3": -0.7392075694855115, "labelr4": 0.5957700327673603, "pos": 0.262, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.4939, "0_day_return": -1.9154929577464783, "1_day_return": -1.9154929577464783, "2_day_return": -2.8719126938541066, "3_day_return": -3.5898908673176355, "4_day_return": -3.0155083285468014, "label": -1, "return": -0.00377854049036448, "excess_return": -1.9117144172561136, "count_of_word": 614, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.6053121, "prof1": 0.39468792, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5111420614297231, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4888579385702769, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.6053121, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.39468792, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.47595122, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.52404875, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.44320184, "tr_prof1": 0.5567982, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.54801875, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.45198125, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.46890909999999997, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.53109086, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.6028498000000001, "headline_prof21": 0.39715016, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.49611109999999997, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.50388896, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.40056792, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.5994321, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.3439507, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.65604925, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": -1.9154929577464783, "returnpredvader": -1.9154929577464783, "returnpredsgd": 1.9154929577464783, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.000392876222982, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9945913801970967, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9888793447872297, "cumreturn1b": 5.086684466508477, "cumreturn1d": 1.2273516575590004, "cumreturn1e": 2.020929321140049, "cumreturndow": 1.241574744921108, "cumreturnsp500": 1.154686560825356}, {"Unnamed: 0": 19526, "Unnamed: 0.1": 19526, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 19526, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 19526, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 19526, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 19526, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 19526, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 19526, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 19526, "level_0": 19526, "index": 19526, "text": "FEB 26 (REUTERS) - FINNISH TELECOM NETWORK EQUIPMENT MAKER NOKIA OYJ IS EXPLORING STRATEGIC OPTIONS AND IS WORKING WITH ADVISERS TO CONSIDER POTENTIAL ASSET SALES AND MERGERS, BLOOMBERG NEWS REPORTED ON WEDNESDAY, CITING PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER.

EXECUTIVES SAID ON FRIDAY THAT CRUDE SALES TO CHINA HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY KEY TO BRINGING PETROBRAS THROUGH THE DEMAND CRISIS CAUSED BY THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, WHILE BUNKER FUELS SALES HAD ALSO REMAINED ROBUST.  \u201cOUR COMMERCIAL TEAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPING A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH SHANDONG REFINERIES IN CHINA WHERE OUR OIL HAS STRONG DEMAND EVEN DURING THE CRISIS,\u201d CHIEF LOGISTICS OFFICER ANDR\u00c9 BARRETO CHIARINI SAID, CITING APPETITE FOR THE OUTPUT FROM FOUR SPECIFIC OFFSHORE OILFIELDS IN BRAZIL.  \u201cCRUDE OIL FROM THE LULA, IRACEMA, SAPINHOA AND BUZIOS FIELDS HAVE THE SAME OVERALL CHARACTERISTICS AS SPECIFIC CHINESE OILS ... THAT ARE EXPERIENCING DECLINING PRODUCTION,\u201d HE SAID.  HE ADDED THAT PETROBRAS HAS CAPACITY TO BOOST OIL EXPORTS 10% ABOVE THE APRIL RECORD OF 1 MILLION BPD.  IN A SIGN THAT ADHERENCE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES IS SLIPPING FROM AN ALREADY LOW BASELINE IN BRAZIL, PETROBRAS DOWNSTREAM CHIEF ANELISE LARA TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT DOMESTIC DEMAND FOR GASOLINE AND DIESEL HAD REBOUNDED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM LOWS IN EARLY APRIL.  WHILE DEMAND FOR GASOLINE HAD BEEN 65% LOWER THAN NORMAL, IT IS NOW OFF ONLY 40% TO 45%, SHE SAID. DIESEL CONSUMPTION HAD FALLEN 50%, BUT IS NOW ONLY 30% OFF NORMAL LEVELS.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS DEMAND FOR ALL PRODUCTS EXCEPT JET FUEL TO RETURN TO NEAR-NORMAL LEVELS IN THE THIRD OR FOURTH QUARTER, LARA ADDED.  EXECUTIVES ALSO SAID THEY WOULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE COMPANY\u2019S REAL ESTATE FOOTPRINT TO CUT COSTS. THE HOME OFFICE REGIME ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE PANDEMIC SHOWED THAT 50% OF OFFICE WORKERS COULD EFFECTIVELY WORK FROM HOME PERMANENTLY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE ROBERTO CASTELLO BRANCO SAID.

THE RATING OUTLOOK IS STABLE.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  CORONAVIRUS HITS VOLUMES; IMPACT SHORT-LIVED: FITCH BELIEVES THAT U.S. HEALTHCARE AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, INCLUDING PROVIDERS OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES, SHOULD BE LESS AFFECTED LONG-TERM BY CORONAVIRUS AND ITS INFLUENCE ON U.S. CONSUMERS\u2019 BEHAVIOR THAN OTHER CORPORATE SECTORS BECAUSE DEMAND IS LESS ECONOMICALLY SENSITIVE AND OFTEN TIMES IS NOT DISCRETIONARY. HOWEVER, FITCH NOTES THAT WHILE THE IMPACT FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING UHS, IS EXPECTED TO BE RELATIVELY MUTED COMPARED TO MORE DISCRETIONARY SECTORS, DEPRESSED VOLUMES OF ELECTIVE PATIENT PROCEDURES HAVE BEGUN TO MEANINGFULLY WEIGH ON REVENUE AND CASH FLOW BEGINNING IN Q220. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CANCELLED ELECTIVE PROCEDURES IN BOTH INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SETTINGS IN ORDER TO INCREASE CAPACITY FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS AND IN RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT ORDERS.  FITCH CURRENTLY BELIEVES UHS HAS SUFFICIENT HEADROOM IN THE \u2018BB+\u2019 RATING TO ABSORB THESE IMPACTS, WHICH IS PREDICATED ON AN ASSUMPTION THAT THE HEALTHCARE SERVICES SECTOR WILL EXPERIENCE A STRONG RECOVERY IN ELECTIVE PATIENT VOLUMES BEGINNING IN LATE 2020 AND INTO 2021. HOWEVER, THERE COULD BE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE RATING IF THE OUTBREAK IS OF LONGER DURATION AND IMPACTS CASH FLOW IN 2020 MORE THAN CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED (PERHAPS DUE TO PATIENT PREFERENCE TO CONTINUE TO DEFER CARE) OR THE HEALTHCARE SERVICES SEGMENT PROVES TO BE MORE ECONOMICALLY SENSITIVE THAN DURING PAST U.S. ECONOMIC RECESSIONS, LEADING TO A SLOWER RECOVERY IN ELECTIVE PATIENT VOLUMES AND PRICING IN 2021-2022.  SUSTAINABLY LOW DEBT LEVERAGE: FITCH EXPECTS UHS WILL OPERATE WITH GROSS DEBT/EBITDA AFTER NET DISTRIBUTIONS TO ASSOCIATES AND MINORITIES AROUND 3X IN 2020 AS A RESULT OF THE VOLUME DECLINES, THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE CONSIDERED CONSISTENT WITH THE \u2018BB+\u2019 IDR. THIS IS BEFORE CONSIDERATION OF GRANTS RECEIVED UNDER THE CARES ACT. AMOUNTS RECEIVED TO-DATE, SHOULD THEY BE KEPT AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS REVENUES, WOULD INCREASE EBITDA BY $239 MILLION AND REDUCE LEVERAGE TO THE MID-2X RANGE. THIS COMPARES TO LEVERAGE OF 2.1X AT DEC. 31, 2019, THE LOWEST AMONG FITCH-RATED HOSPITAL COMPANIES, DRIVEN BY MANAGEMENT\u2019S RELATIVELY MORE CONSERVATIVE BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT AND MA STRATEGY. MANAGEMENT ACKNOWLEDGED ON THE 2Q19 EARNINGS CALL THAT THE LEVERAGE PROFILE IS LOW AND \u201cPROBABLY RELATIVELY INEFFICIENT\u201d, BUT PROVIDES THE COMPANY A LARGE AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY TO RETURN CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS OR OPPORTUNISTICALLY MAKE ACQUISITIONS.  FITCH BELIEVES THAT AS A RESULT OF THAT FLEXIBILITY, EBITDA DECLINES AS A RESULT OF VOLUME REDUCTIONS DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC ARE NOT EXPECTED TO CAUSE UHS TO MEANINGFULLY AND PERSISTENTLY EXCEED ITS NEGATIVE SENSITIVITIES. FITCH ALSO BELIEVES THAT GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND THE COMPANY\u2019S PAUSE ON ITS DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY, THE COMPANY WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO ACT AGGRESSIVELY WITH RESPECT TO LEVERAGING TRANSACTIONS OR CAPITAL ALLOCATION IN THE INTERMEDIATE TERM.  DIVERSIFICATION, STABILITY FROM BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: UHS OPERATES ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS AND A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SEGMENT, WHICH PROVIDES REVENUE DIVERSIFICATION AS WELL AS IMPROVED FINANCIAL STABILITY AND PROFITABILITY. GOOD ORGANIC GROWTH, INCLUDING IN ADMISSIONS AND REVENUES, IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGITS AND STABLE PROFIT MARGINS ARE EXPECTED OVER THE RATINGS HORIZON AS THE BEHAVIORAL SEGMENT CONTINUES TO BENEFIT FROM IMPROVING PARITY BETWEEN PAYERS\u2019 COVERAGE OF CARE RELATIVE TO THE GENERAL ACUTE SEGMENT. RECENT ACQUISITIONS ARE IN LINE WITH FITCH\u2019S EXPECTATION THAT OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SEGMENT WILL BE A PRIMARY FOCUS OF CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT.  POST-PANDEMIC MARGIN HEADWINDS: FITCH EXPECTS THAT HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING UHS, WILL ADAPT OPERATIONS TO MANAGE THE BUSINESS DISRUPTION EFFECTS OF CORONAVIRUS ON OPERATIONS THROUGH INITIATIVES LIKE TELEHEALTH. THIS WILL HELP MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF LOCALIZED OUTBREAKS OF THE VIRUS ON PATIENT VOLUMES BEFORE A VACCINE OR HIGHLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS ARE AVAILABLE. THE LONGER-TERM EFFECT OF THE ECONOMIC DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC ON HEALTHCARE CONSUMERS IS LESS CERTAIN. THE SECTOR HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN FAIRLY RESILIENT, BUT NOT IMMUNE, TO THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC RECESSIONS. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TYPICALLY EXPERIENCE LOWER OPERATING MARGINS DURING AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING RECESSIONS DUE TO TREATING GREATER NUMBERS OF UNINSURED PATIENTS AND PATIENTS WITH RELATIVELY LESS PROFITABLE GOVERNMENT SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE.  FITCH ASSUMES UHS WILL CONTINUE TO PERFORM WELL IN TERMS OF VOLUMES AND COMMERCIAL PRICING, DUE IN LARGE PART TO ITS STRONG MARKET SHARES IN FAVORABLE URBAN MARKETS WHERE VOLUMES TEND TO BE WEIGHTED TOWARD A HIGHER-ACUITY PATIENT MIX. HOWEVER, UHS\u2019S MARKETS MAY EXHIBIT MORE ECONOMIC CYCLICALITY OVER TIME DUE TO THE SERVICES-ORIENTED EMPLOYMENT MARKETS IN LAS VEGAS AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THIS SOLID OPERATING PROFILE WILL HELP THE COMPANY DEFEND PROFITABILITY IN THE FACE OF WEAK ORGANIC OPERATING TRENDS, BUT PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH TO ENTIRELY OVERCOME THE EFFECTS OF CORONAVIRUS-RELATED UNEMPLOYMENT ON PATIENT MIX. FITCH EXPECTS OPERATING MARGINS FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO REBOUND SHARPLY IN 2021 FOLLOWING A 2020 TROUGH THAT REFLECTS THE PEAK PANDEMIC BUSINESS DISRUPTION, BUT TO REMAIN BELOW THE 2019 LEVEL FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  FLEXIBILITY FROM SOLID CASH FLOWS: FITCH EXPECTS FCF WILL SUSTAIN GENERALLY WITHIN $500 MILLION TO $700 MILLION PER YEAR. THESE LEVELS COMPARE WITH $712 MILLION AND $588 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  DERIVATION SUMMARY  UHS\u2019S \u2018BB+\u2019 IDR REFLECTS THE COMPANY\u2019S STRONG FINANCIAL PROFILE RESULTING FROM LOW LEVERAGE, AMPLE LIQUIDITY AND STRONG OPERATING MARGINS. THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING PROFILE IS STRONG WITH OPERATIONS FOCUSED IN URBAN AND LARGE SUBURBAN MARKETS, WHICH HAVE BETTER ORGANIC GROWTH PROSPECTS THAN RURAL AND SUBURBAN MARKETS. UHS\u2019S MARKETS MAY EXHIBIT MORE ECONOMIC CYCLICALITY THAN OTHERS. UHS IS ALSO DIVERSIFIED IN ITS REVENUE STREAM, WITH APPROXIMATELY HALF OF NET REVENUES COMING FROM ITS INPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SEGMENT. UHS\u2019S OPERATING POSITION AND LOW LEVERAGE ARE THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT DISTINGUISH ITS RATINGS FROM LOWER RATED PEERS SUCH AS TENET HEALTHCARE CORP. (B/STABLE) AND COMMUNITY HEALTH SYSTEMS (CCC). UHS IS RATED A NOTCH ABOVE HCA, INC., WHICH FITCH VIEWS AS HAVING A STRONG COMPETITIVE POSITION AND MARKET LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL OFFSET BY HIGHER LEVERAGE.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS  FITCH\u2019S KEY ASSUMPTIONS WITHIN OUR RATING CASE FOR THE ISSUER  \u2014REVENUE DECLINES BY 5.8% IN 2020 DUE TO PANDEMIC RELATED BUSINESS DISRUPTION, WITH A STEADY RECOVERY IN PATIENT VOLUMES BEGINNING IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AND INTO 2021;  \u2014EBITDA MARGIN CONTRACTS 450 BPS IN 2020 DUE TO NEGATIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE ON PATIENT VOLUMES DECLINES AND REBOUNDS STRONGLY IN 2021 BUT REMAINS BELOW THE 2019 FITCH-CALCULATED LEVEL OF 16.5% THROUGH 2022 BECAUSE OF RECESSIONARY IMPACTS ON HEALTHCARE CONSUMERS IN THE POST-PANDEMIC PERIOD;  - FITCH\u2019S REVENUE AND EBITDA FORECAST FOR UHS DO NOT INCLUDE CARES ACT OR OTHER FISCAL STIMULUS GRANT FUNDING;  \u2014THERE IS NO NOTABLE IMPACT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH CONVERSION CYCLE;  \u2014CAPEX IS REDUCED TO 5.5% OF REVENUES IN 2020 COMMENSURATE WITH GUIDANCE, INCREASING AS A PERCENT OF REVENUE OVER THE RATINGS FORECAST. THE COMPANY HALTS SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS IN 2020-2021, RESUMING IN 2022;  \u2014FCF REMAINS AROUND $500 MILLION TO $700 MILLION.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  FACTORS THAT COULD, INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY, LEAD TO POSITIVE RATING ACTION/UPGRADE:  AN UPGRADE OF UHS\u2019S IDR TO \u2018BBB-\u2018 IS UNLIKELY IN THE NEAR TO INTERMEDIATE TERM, AS FITCH VIEWS THE RISKS AROUND REIMBURSEMENT AND OTHER REGULATORY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IN THE U.S. \u2014 AND UHS\u2019S RELIANCE ON GOVERNMENT PAYERS \u2014 AS A MATERIAL AND UNCONTROLLABLE RISK FOR UHS AND ITS PEERS;  UHS\u2019S RATINGS AND CREDIT METRICS PROVIDE IT WITH FLEXIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN HEALTHCARE PROVIDER CONSOLIDATION, WHICH FITCH EXPECTS TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE INTERMEDIATE TERM. POSITIVE MOMENTUM WOULD ALSO LIKELY REQUIRE A MORE SPECIFIC FINANCIAL POLICY.  FACTORS THAT COULD, INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY, LEAD TO NEGATIVE RATING ACTION/DOWNGRADE:  A DOWNGRADE OF UHS\u2019S IDR TO \u2018BB\u2019 COULD RESULT FROM PRESSURED MARGINS AND CASH FLOWS, OR A LARGE, LEVERAGING TRANSACTION THAT RESULTS IN TOTAL DEBT TO OPERATING EBITDA AFTER NET DISTRIBUTIONS TO MINORITIES AND ASSOCIATES EXPECTED TO BE SUSTAINED ABOVE 3.0X OR CFO AFTER CAPEX-TO-GROSS DEBT BELOW 7.5%.  THE NEGATIVE RATING SENSITIVES COULD BE TRIPPED IF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC HAS A GREATER IMPACT ON CASH FLOW THAN FITCH CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES. THERE IS STILL A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE PACE OF ACCELERATION OF CORONAVIRUS CASES ALONG WITH THE ULTIMATE LEVEL OF CORONAVIRUS PATIENT VOLUMES IN UHS\u2019S MARKETS AND THESE FACTORS WILL BE IMPORTANT TO THE TRAJECTORY OF 2020 REVENUE AND EBITDA.  BEST/WORST CASE RATING SCENARIO  INTERNATIONAL SCALE CREDIT RATINGS OF NON-FINANCIAL CORPORATE ISSUERS HAVE A BEST-CASE RATING UPGRADE SCENARIO (DEFINED AS THE 99TH PERCENTILE OF RATING TRANSITIONS, MEASURED IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION) OF THREE NOTCHES OVER A THREE-YEAR RATING HORIZON; AND A WORST-CASE RATING DOWNGRADE SCENARIO (DEFINED AS THE 99TH PERCENTILE OF RATING TRANSITIONS, MEASURED IN A NEGATIVE DIRECTION) OF FOUR NOTCHES OVER THREE YEARS. THE COMPLETE SPAN OF BEST- AND WORST-CASE SCENARIO CREDIT RATINGS FOR ALL RATING CATEGORIES RANGES FROM 'AAA' TO 'D'. BEST- AND WORST-CASE SCENARIO CREDIT RATINGS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY USED TO DETERMINE SECTOR-SPECIFIC BEST- AND WORST-CASE SCENARIO CREDIT RATINGS, VISIT HERE  LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE  GOOD FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY: UHS\u2019S LIQUIDITY PROFILE IS SOLID FOR THE \u2018BB+\u2019 IDR. THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT DEBT MATURITIES UNTIL 2021, WHEN THE $450 MILLION A/R SECURITIZATION ($260 MILLION OUTSTANDING AT MARCH 31, 2020) TERMINATES, WITH THE NEAREST BOND MATURITY BEING $700 MILLION OF 4.75% NOTES DUE 2022. FITCH\u2019S FORECAST ASSUMES THAT UHS WILL REFINANCE THIS DEBT. UHS DOES NOT HAVE LARGE CASH NEEDS FOR WORKING CAPITAL OR EXHIBIT MUCH SEASONALITY IN CASH FLOW GENERATION. CASH ON HAND IS TYPICALLY LOW, AROUND $50 MILLION TO $100 MILLION; THE COMPANY HAS $998 MILLION IN REVOLVING CREDIT CAPACITY AND IN RECENT PERIODS HAS MAINTAINED CLOSE TO FULL AVAILABILITY ON THIS CREDIT LINE.  UHS ALSO HAS GOOD FLEXIBILITY UNDER THE DEBT AGREEMENT COVENANTS. THE BANK AGREEMENT INCLUDES A FINANCIAL MAINTENANCE COVENANT THAT LIMITS CONSOLIDATED NET LEVERAGE TO 3.75X OR BELOW, INCREASING TO 4.25X FOR FOUR QUARTERS FOLLOWING AN ACQUISITION. AT MARCH 31, 2020, FITCH ESTIMATES THAT UHS HAS INCREMENTAL SECURED DEBT CAPACITY OF ROUGHLY $3.1 BILLION UNDER THE 3.75X CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO TEST.  DEBT ISSUE NOTCHING: FITCH DOES NOT EMPLOY A WATERFALL RECOVERY ANALYSIS FOR ISSUERS RATED \u2018BB+\u2019. THE FURTHER UP THE SPECULATIVE-GRADE CONTINUUM A RATING MOVES, THE MORE COMPRESSED THE NOTCHING BETWEEN THE SPECIFIC CLASSES OF ISSUANCES BECOMES. AS SUCH, FITCH RATES THE SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY AND SENIOR SECURED BONDS \u2018BBB-\u2018/\u2018RR1\u2019, ONE NOTCH ABOVE THE IDR. THIS RATING ILLUSTRATES FITCH\u2019S EXPECTATION FOR SUPERIOR RECOVERY PROSPECTS IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. FURTHERMORE, FITCH BELIEVES UHS HAS GOOD FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AT THE \u2018BB+\u2019 IDR, ILLUSTRATED BY RELATIVELY LOW SECURED DEBT LEVERAGE, SUPPORTING THE ONE NOTCH UPLIFT.  REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING  THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION USED IN THE ANALYSIS ARE DESCRIBED IN THE APPLICABLE CRITERIA.  ESG CONSIDERATIONS  UNLESS OTHERWISE DISCLOSED IN THIS SECTION, THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF ESG CREDIT RELEVANCE IS A SCORE OF 3 - ESG ISSUES ARE CREDIT NEUTRAL OR HAVE ONLY A MINIMAL CREDIT IMPACT ON THE ENTITY, EITHER DUE TO THEIR NATURE OR THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ARE BEING MANAGED BY THE ENTITY.  UHS HAS AN ESG RELEVANCE SCORE OF 4 FOR EXPOSURE TO SOCIAL IMPACTS DUE TO PRESSURE TO CONTAIN HEALTHCARE SPENDING GROWTH; HIGHLY SENSITIVE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND SOCIAL PRESSURE TO CONTAIN COSTS OR RESTRICT PRICING WHICH HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE CREDIT PROFILE, AND IS RELEVANT TO THE RATING IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER FACTORS.  UHS HAS AN ESG RELEVANCE SCORE OF 4 FOR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT CONTROL THE MILLER FAMILY HAS VIA ITS OWNERSHIP AND THE RELATIVE VOTING RIGHTS OF DIFFERENT SHARE CLASSES.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE ELON MUSK IS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE TO DELIVER ON HIS PROMISE OF STABILIZING PRODUCTION FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S MASS MARKET SEDANS, SEEN CRUCIAL TO IT EASING A CASH CRUNCH AND ACHIEVING LONG-TERM PROFITABILITY.

THE $2,000 CUT IN PRICES, HOWEVER, WEIGHED ON THE STOCK, PUSHING IT DOWN 9.4 PERCENT TO $301.69 IN MORNING TRADE ON A BROADLY WEAKER DAY FOR U.S. MARKETS.  \u201cTHE PRICE CUT IS WHAT\u2019S DRIVING THE STOCK LOWER, AS IT OPENLY ACKNOWLEDGES THE SUNSET OF SUBSIDY DOLLARS IS A MATERIAL HEADWIND,\u201d CRAIG IRWIN, AN ANALYST WITH ROTH CAPITAL PARTNERS.

REUTERS/ARND WIEGMANN  LONDON (REUTERS BREAKINGVIEWS) - EUROPEAN TELECOMS CONSOLIDATION IS RUMBLING ALONG, AND LIBERTY GLOBAL CHAIRMAN JOHN MALONE IS ONCE AGAIN TAKING HIS CHIPS OFF THE TABLE. THE \u201cCABLE COWBOY\u201d AND HIS CHIEF EXECUTIVE MIKE FRIES ARE SELLING SUB-SCALE CABLE BUSINESSES TO MOBILE COMPANIES AT RICH VALUATIONS. THEY\u2019RE BANKING UPFRONT THE BENEFITS THAT BUYERS HOPE TO REAP BY BUNDLING TOGETHER THE DIFFERENT SERVICES, AND LIKELY GETTING THE BETTER SIDE OF THE BARGAIN.  LIBERTY IS SELLING ITS SWISS UNIT TO THE COUNTY\u2019S NUMBER TWO MOBILE CARRIER SUNRISE FOR A $6.3 BILLION ENTERPRISE VALUE, OR 10 TIMES THE ADJUSTED EBITDA IT GENERATED LAST YEAR. THE THOMSON REUTERS EUROPE INTEGRATED TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES INDEX TRADES AT JUST FIVE TIMES EBITDA. LIBERTY, WHOSE CHAIRMAN ALSO CONTROLS A LARGE STAKE IN U.S. GROUP CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, LAST YEAR AGREED TO OFFLOAD ITS GERMAN, HUNGARIAN, ROMANIAN AND CZECH BUSINESS TO VODAFONE FOR ABOUT 11.5 TIMES EBITDA, AND IN 2017 EXTRACTED A NEAR-11 TIMES MULTIPLE FROM DEUTSCHE TELEKOM FOR ITS AUSTRIAN DIVISION.  MALONE AND HIS LIBERTY INVESTORS HAVE MADE A GOOD RETURN FROM BEING A RELATIVELY SMALL PLAYER IN TYPICALLY CUTTHROAT MARKETS. THE LONDON-BASED GROUP POURED ABOUT $1.6 BILLION OF EQUITY INTO THE SWISS BUSINESS IN 2005, FOR EXAMPLE, AND RECEIVED $3.9 BILLION OF CASH OVER THE NEXT 13 YEARS AFTER NETTING OFF INTEREST PAYMENTS. ADD THE CASH SALE PROCEEDS OF $2.6 BILLION, AND LIBERTY HAS QUADRUPLED ITS MONEY. CRUCIALLY, IT IS GETTING OUT OF A BUSINESS THAT STRUGGLES TO COMPETE WITH INCUMBENT SWISSCOM. IT\u2019S A SIMILAR STORY IN GERMANY, WHERE VODAFONE IS HOPING TO USE LIBERTY\u2019S CABLE INFRASTRUCTURE TO TAKE ON DEUTSCHE TELEKOM.  WHY ARE THE BUYERS PAYING BIG PREMIUMS FOR LIBERTY\u2019S ASSETS? SELLING MOBILE SUBSCRIPTIONS IN EUROPE IS A LOW-MARGIN, COMPETITIVE BUSINESS. THE BUYERS HOPE THAT BY BUNDLING IT TOGETHER WITH TV AND BROADBAND, THEY CAN KEEP CUSTOMERS FOR LONGER. BUT CONSULTANCY ENDERS ANALYSIS RECKONS THE EVIDENCE IS PATCHY. CUSTOMER \u201cCHURN\u201d TENDS NOT TO CHANGE MUCH BECAUSE RIVAL TELCOS RESPOND BY DROPPING THEIR OWN PRICES, AND CARRIERS END UP SELLING THE COMBINED SERVICES FOR LESS. IN GERMANY, BUNDLE DISCOUNTS HAVE EXCEEDED 30 PERCENT, ENDERS RECKONS.  DEBT INCREASES THE RISKINESS OF THIS STRATEGY FOR THE LIKES OF VODAFONE AND SUNRISE. BOTH GROUPS\u2019 SHARES FELL AFTER THE DEALS WERE ANNOUNCED, AS INVESTORS TOOK FRIGHT. LIBERTY, MEANWHILE, HAS A $15 BILLION WAR CHEST. MALONE COULD USE THAT TO BUY BACK SHARES, OR EVEN SCOOP UP COMPANIES ON THE CHEAP WHEN THE ECONOMY, AND EQUITY PRICES, NEXT TURN DOWN.", "Ticker": "LBTYA", "Date": "2019-02-28T00:00:00", "key": "20190228LBTYA", "labelr0": 0.3427265803503421, "labelr1": -0.4933586337761008, "labelr2": 0.7627765064836112, "labelr3": -1.1355034065102223, "labelr4": -0.038284839203681316, "pos": 0.27, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.5719, "0_day_return": 0.34272658035034986, "1_day_return": 0.34272658035034986, "2_day_return": 0.2656546489563594, "3_day_return": -0.8728652751423094, "4_day_return": -0.9108159392789416, "label": 1, "return": 0.006895320532288951, "excess_return": 0.3358312598180609, "count_of_word": 426, "pred": -1, "prof-1": 0.56457645, "prof1": 0.43542355, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5244135086601993, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4755864913398008, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.56457645, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.43542355, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.5357531, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.4642469, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.44963512, "tr_prof1": 0.55036485, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5069404000000001, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.49305952, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5894289, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.41057113, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.57618695, "headline_prof21": 0.42381305, "textplusheadline_pred": -1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.50045216, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.49954787, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.3131436, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.6868563, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.33280984, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.6671902, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": 0.34272658035034986, "returnpredvader": 0.34272658035034986, "returnpredsgd": -0.34272658035034986, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0188467861738948, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0043365400301416, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0236698984122607, "cumreturn1b": 1.2387110504740906, "cumreturn1d": 1.0995456955475584, "cumreturn1e": 1.01240741897648, "cumreturndow": 1.1169945811831554, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1147970744812652}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2964, "Unnamed: 0.1": 2964, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 2964, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 2964, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 2964, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 2964, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 2964, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 2964, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 2964, "level_0": 2964, "index": 2964, "text": "MUMBAI, MARCH 1 (REUTERS) - INDIA\u2019S FINANCIAL CRIME FIGHTING AGENCY SAID ON FRIDAY IT WAS CONDUCTING SEARCHES ON PROPERTIES OF FORMER ICICI BANK CEO CHANDA KOCHHAR AND A TOP EXECUTIVE OF VIDEOCON GROUP, AMID PROBES INTO SUSPECTED CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND MISCONDUCT.

FILE PHOTO: A WOMAN HOLDS HER PHONE NEAR AN APPLE COMPANY LOGO IN BEIJING, CHINA DECEMBER 14, 2018. REUTERS/JASON LEE  JUDGE GONZALO CURIEL OF THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA ON THURSDAY RULED THAT QUALCOMM, THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST SUPPLIER OF MOBILE PHONE CHIPS, WAS OBLIGATED TO PAY NEARLY $1 BILLION IN REBATE PAYMENTS TO APPLE, WHICH FOR YEARS USED QUALCOMM\u2019S MODEM CHIPS TO CONNECT IPHONES TO WIRELESS DATA NETWORKS.  THE PAYMENTS WERE PART OF A BUSINESS COOPERATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO COMPANIES AMID THE PECULIAR PATENT LICENSING PRACTICES OF THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY.  IN GENERAL, THE CONTRACT FACTORIES THAT BUILT APPLE\u2019S IPHONES WOULD PAY QUALCOMM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR THE USE OF QUALCOMM\u2019S PATENTED TECHNOLOGY IN IPHONES, A COST THAT APPLE WOULD REIMBURSE THE CONTRACT FACTORIES FOR. SEPARATELY, QUALCOMM AND APPLE HAD A COOPERATION AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH QUALCOMM WOULD PAY APPLE A REBATE ON THE IPHONE PATENT PAYMENTS IF APPLE AGREED NOT TO ATTACK IN COURT OR WITH REGULATORS.  IN A LAWSUIT FILED TWO YEARS AGO, APPLE SUED QUALCOMM, ALLEGING THAT THE CHIP SUPPLIER HAD BROKEN THE COOPERATION AGREEMENT BY NOT PAYING NEARLY $1 BILLION IN PATENT ROYALTY REBATES.  QUALCOMM IN TURN ALLEGED THAT IT STOPPED PAYING THE REBATE PAYMENTS BECAUSE APPLE HAD BROKEN THE AGREEMENT BY URGING OTHER SMARTPHONE MAKERS TO COMPLAIN TO REGULATORS AND MAKING \u201cFALSE AND MISLEADING\u201d STATEMENTS TO THE KOREAN FAIR TRADE COMMISSION, WHICH WAS INVESTIGATING QUALCOMM OVER ANTITRUST ALLEGATIONS.

REUTERS/RICARDO MORAES/FILE PHOTO  THE PLAN TO SPLIT UP THE CARRIER, FILED IN A BRAZILIAN COURT ON WEDNESDAY, IS A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM A PREVIOUS PROPOSAL AND ADDS FRESH COMPETITION FOR SOME OF THE MOST-COVETED AIRPORT SLOTS IN BRAZIL. BUT IT ALSO SHUTS THE DOOR ON A PREVIOUS OFFER BY COMPETITOR AZUL SA.  AZUL SIGNED A PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT THIS MONTH TO PAY AT LEAST $105 MILLION FOR A SELECTION OF AVIANCA BRASIL\u2019S ASSETS, A PROPOSAL THAT HAD BEEN CONSIDERED A COUP BY ANALYSTS WHO SAW IT AS A WAY FOR AZUL TO CHALLENGE ITS BIGGER COMPETITORS: LATAM AND GOL.

AZUL DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE STATUS OF ITS POTENTIAL BID. TO BE SURE, AZUL COULD STILL BID, BUT NOT UNDER ITS INITIAL PROPOSAL, WHICH HAD ALSO INCLUDED TAKING OVER MANY OF AVIANCA\u2019S AIRCRAFT LEASES.  AZUL CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER JOHN RODGERSON TOLD REUTERS IN MARCH THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT LATAM OR GOL COULD BID FOR AVIANCA BRASIL, DUE TO POTENTIAL ANTITRUST ISSUES.

THE COMPANY OFFERS ITS 2.3 BILLION USERS FEATURES SUCH AS MENUS AND PROMPTS IN 111 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, DEEMED TO BE OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED. REUTERS HAS FOUND ANOTHER 31 WIDELY SPOKEN LANGUAGES ON FACEBOOK THAT DO NOT HAVE OFFICIAL SUPPORT.  DETAILED RULES KNOWN AS \u201cCOMMUNITY STANDARDS,\u201d WHICH BAR USERS FROM POSTING OFFENSIVE MATERIAL INCLUDING HATE SPEECH AND CELEBRATIONS OF VIOLENCE, WERE TRANSLATED IN ONLY 41 LANGUAGES OUT OF THE 111 SUPPORTED AS OF EARLY MARCH, REUTERS FOUND.  FACEBOOK\u2019S 15,000-STRONG CONTENT MODERATION WORKFORCE SPEAKS ABOUT 50 TONGUES, THOUGH THE COMPANY SAID IT HIRES PROFESSIONAL TRANSLATORS WHEN NEEDED. AUTOMATED TOOLS FOR IDENTIFYING HATE SPEECH WORK IN ABOUT 30.  THE LANGUAGE DEFICIT COMPLICATES FACEBOOK\u2019S BATTLE TO REIN IN HARMFUL CONTENT AND THE DAMAGE IT CAN CAUSE, INCLUDING TO THE COMPANY ITSELF. COUNTRIES INCLUDING AUSTRALIA, SINGAPORE AND THE UK ARE NOW THREATENING HARSH NEW REGULATIONS, PUNISHABLE BY STEEP FINES OR JAIL TIME FOR EXECUTIVES, IF IT FAILS TO PROMPTLY REMOVE OBJECTIONABLE POSTS.  THE COMMUNITY STANDARDS ARE UPDATED MONTHLY AND RUN TO ABOUT 9,400 WORDS IN ENGLISH.  MONIKA BICKERT, THE FACEBOOK VICE PRESIDENT IN CHARGE OF THE STANDARDS, HAS PREVIOUSLY TOLD REUTERS THAT THEY WERE \u201cA HEAVY LIFT TO TRANSLATE INTO ALL THOSE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES.\u201d  A FACEBOOK SPOKESWOMAN SAID THIS WEEK THE RULES ARE TRANSLATED CASE BY CASE DEPENDING ON WHETHER A LANGUAGE HAS A CRITICAL MASS OF USAGE AND WHETHER FACEBOOK IS A PRIMARY INFORMATION SOURCE FOR SPEAKERS. THE SPOKESWOMAN SAID THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC NUMBER FOR CRITICAL MASS.  SHE SAID AMONG PRIORITIES FOR TRANSLATIONS ARE KHMER, THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE IN CAMBODIA, AND SINHALA, THE DOMINANT LANGUAGE IN SRI LANKA, WHERE THE GOVERNMENT BLOCKED FACEBOOK THIS WEEK TO STEM RUMORS ABOUT DEVASTATING EASTER SUNDAY BOMBINGS.  A REUTERS REPORT FOUND LAST YEAR THAT HATE SPEECH ON FACEBOOK THAT HELPED FOSTER ETHNIC CLEANSING IN MYANMAR WENT UNCHECKED IN PART BECAUSE THE COMPANY WAS SLOW TO ADD MODERATION TOOLS AND STAFF FOR THE LOCAL LANGUAGE.  FACEBOOK SAYS IT NOW OFFERS THE RULES IN BURMESE AND HAS MORE THAN 100 SPEAKERS OF THE LANGUAGE AMONG ITS WORKFORCE.  THE SPOKESWOMAN SAID FACEBOOK\u2019S EFFORTS TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM HARMFUL CONTENT HAD \u201cA LEVEL OF LANGUAGE INVESTMENT THAT SURPASSES MOST ANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANY.\u201d  BUT HUMAN RIGHTS OFFICIALS SAY FACEBOOK IS IN JEOPARDY OF A REPEAT OF THE MYANMAR PROBLEMS IN OTHER STRIFE-TORN NATIONS WHERE ITS LANGUAGE CAPABILITIES HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA.  \u201cTHESE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE RULES OF THE ROAD AND BOTH CUSTOMERS AND REGULATORS SHOULD INSIST SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS MAKE THE RULES KNOWN AND EFFECTIVELY POLICE THEM,\u201d SAID PHIL ROBERTSON, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH\u2019S ASIA DIVISION. \u201cFAILURE TO DO SO OPENS THE DOOR TO SERIOUS ABUSES.\u201d  ABUSE IN FIJIAN  MOHAMMED SANEEM, THE SUPERVISOR OF ELECTIONS IN FIJI, SAID HE FELT THE IMPACT OF THE LANGUAGE GAP DURING ELECTIONS IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC NATION IN NOVEMBER LAST YEAR. RACIST COMMENTS PROLIFERATED ON FACEBOOK IN FIJIAN, WHICH THE SOCIAL NETWORK DOES NOT SUPPORT. SANEEM SAID HE DEDICATED A STAFFER TO EMAILING POSTS AND TRANSLATIONS TO A FACEBOOK EMPLOYEE IN SINGAPORE TO SEEK REMOVALS.  FACEBOOK SAID IT DID NOT REQUEST TRANSLATIONS, AND IT GAVE REUTERS A POST-ELECTION LETTER FROM SANEEM PRAISING ITS \u201cTIMELY AND EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE.\u201d  SANEEM TOLD REUTERS THAT HE VALUED THE HELP BUT HAD EXPECTED PRO-ACTIVE MEASURES FROM FACEBOOK.  \u201cIF THEY ARE ALLOWING USERS TO POST IN THEIR LANGUAGE, THERE SHOULD BE GUIDELINES AVAILABLE IN THE SAME LANGUAGE,\u201d HE SAID.  SIMILAR ISSUES ABOUND IN AFRICAN NATIONS SUCH AS ETHIOPIA, WHERE DEADLY ETHNIC CLASHES AMONG A POPULATION OF 107 MILLION HAVE BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY UGLY FACEBOOK CONTENT. MUCH OF IT IS IN AMHARIC, A LANGUAGE SUPPORTED BY FACEBOOK. BUT AMHARIC USERS LOOKING UP RULES GET THEM IN ENGLISH.  AT LEAST 652 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE SPEAK LANGUAGES SUPPORTED BY FACEBOOK BUT WHERE RULES ARE NOT TRANSLATED, ACCORDING TO DATA FROM LANGUAGE ENCYCLOPEDIA ETHNOLOGUE. ANOTHER 230 MILLION OR MORE SPEAK ONE OF THE 31 LANGUAGES THAT DO NOT HAVE OFFICIAL SUPPORT.  FACEBOOK USES AUTOMATED SOFTWARE AS A KEY DEFENSE AGAINST PROHIBITED CONTENT. DEVELOPED USING A TYPE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE KNOWN AS MACHINE LEARNING, THESE TOOLS IDENTIFY HATE SPEECH IN ABOUT 30 LANGUAGES AND \u201cTERRORIST PROPAGANDA\u201d IN 19, THE COMPANY SAID.  MACHINE LEARNING REQUIRES MASSIVE VOLUMES OF DATA TO TRAIN COMPUTERS, AND A SCARCITY OF TEXT IN OTHER LANGUAGES PRESENTS A CHALLENGE IN RAPIDLY GROWING THE TOOLS, GUY ROSEN, THE FACEBOOK VICE PRESIDENT WHO OVERSEES AUTOMATED POLICY ENFORCEMENT, HAS TOLD REUTERS.  GROWTH REGIONS  BEYOND THE AUTOMATION AND A FEW OFFICIAL FACT-CHECKERS, FACEBOOK RELIES ON USERS TO REPORT PROBLEMATIC CONTENT. THAT CREATES A MAJOR ISSUE WHERE COMMUNITY STANDARDS ARE NOT UNDERSTOOD OR EVEN KNOWN TO EXIST.  EBELE OKOBI, FACEBOOK\u2019S DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR AFRICA, TOLD REUTERS IN MARCH THAT THE CONTINENT HAD THE WORLD\u2019S LOWEST RATES OF USER REPORTING.  \u201cA LOT OF PEOPLE DON\u2019T EVEN KNOW THAT THERE ARE COMMUNITY STANDARDS,\u201d OKOBI SAID.  FACEBOOK HAS BOUGHT RADIO ADVERTISEMENTS IN NIGERIA AND WORKED WITH LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS TO CHANGE THAT, SHE SAID. IT ALSO HAS HELD TALKS WITH AFRICAN EDUCATION OFFICIALS TO INTRODUCE SOCIAL MEDIA ETIQUETTE INTO THE CURRICULUM, SHE SAID.  SIMULTANEOUSLY, FACEBOOK IS PARTNERING WITH WIRELESS CARRIERS AND OTHER GROUPS TO EXPAND INTERNET ACCESS IN COUNTRIES INCLUDING UGANDA AND THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO WHERE IT HAS YET TO OFFICIALLY SUPPORT WIDELY-USED LANGUAGES SUCH AS LUGANDA AND KITUBA. ASKED THIS WEEK ABOUT THE EXPANSIONS WITHOUT LANGUAGE SUPPORT, FACEBOOK DECLINED TO COMMENT.  THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IN FEBRUARY IT WOULD SOON HAVE ITS FIRST 100 SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA-BASED CONTENT MODERATORS AT AN OUTSOURCING FACILITY IN NAIROBI. THEY WILL JOIN EXISTING TEAMS IN REVIEWING CONTENT IN SOMALI, OROMO AND OTHER LANGUAGES.  BUT THE COMMUNITY STANDARDS ARE NOT TRANSLATED INTO SOMALI OR OROMO. POSTS IN SOMALI FROM LAST YEAR CELEBRATING THE AL-SHABAAB MILITANT GROUP REMAINED ON FACEBOOK FOR MONTHS DESPITE A BAN ON GLORIFYING ORGANIZATIONS OR ACTS THAT FACEBOOK DESIGNATES AS TERRORIST.  \u201cDISBELIEVERS AND APOSTATES, DIE WITH YOUR ANGER,\u201d READ ONE POST SEEN BY REUTERS THIS MONTH THAT PRAISED THE KILLING OF A SUFI CLERIC.  AFTER REUTERS INQUIRED ABOUT THE POST, FACEBOOK SAID IT TOOK DOWN THE AUTHOR\u2019S ACCOUNT BECAUSE IT VIOLATED POLICIES.  ABILITY TO DERAIL  POSTS IN AMHARIC REVIEWED BY REUTERS THIS MONTH ATTACKED THE OROMO AND TIGRAY ETHNIC POPULATIONS IN VICIOUS TERMS THAT CLEARLY VIOLATED FACEBOOK\u2019S BAN ON DISCUSSING ETHNIC GROUPS USING \u201cVIOLENT OR DEHUMANISING SPEECH, STATEMENTS OF INFERIORITY, OR CALLS FOR EXCLUSION.\u201d  FACEBOOK REMOVED THE TWO POSTS REUTERS INQUIRED ABOUT. THE COMPANY ADDED THAT IT HAD ERRED IN ALLOWING ONE OF THEM, FROM DECEMBER 2017, TO REMAIN ONLINE FOLLOWING AN EARLIER USER REPORT.  FOR OFFICIALS SUCH AS SANEEM IN FIJI, FACEBOOK\u2019S EFFORTS TO IMPROVE CONTENT MODERATION AND LANGUAGE SUPPORT ARE PAINFULLY SLOW. SANEEM SAID HE WARNED FACEBOOK MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF THE ELECTION IN THE ARCHIPELAGO OF 900,000 PEOPLE. MOST OF THEM USE FACEBOOK, WITH HALF WRITING IN ENGLISH AND HALF IN FIJIAN, HE ESTIMATED.  \u201cSOCIAL MEDIA HAS THE ABILITY TO COMPLETELY DERAIL AN ELECTION,\u201d SANEEM SAID.  OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES FACE THE SAME PROBLEM TO VARYING DEGREES.  FACEBOOK-OWNED INSTAGRAM SAID ITS 1,179-WORD COMMUNITY GUIDELINES ARE IN 30 OUT OF 51 LANGUAGES OFFERED TO USERS. WHATSAPP, OWNED BY FACEBOOK AS WELL, HAS TERMS IN NINE OF 58 SUPPORTED LANGUAGES, REUTERS FOUND.  ALPHABET INC\u2019S YOUTUBE PRESENTS COMMUNITY GUIDELINES IN 40 OF 80 AVAILABLE LANGUAGES, REUTERS FOUND. TWITTER INC\u2019S RULES ARE IN 37 OF 47 SUPPORTED LANGUAGES, AND SNAP INC\u2019S IN 13 OUT OF 21.  \u201cA LOT OF MISINFORMATION GETS SPREAD AROUND AND THE PROBLEM WITH THE CONTENT PUBLISHERS IS THE RELUCTANCE TO DEAL WITH IT,\u201d SANEEM SAID. \u201cTHEY DO OWE A DUTY OF CARE. \u201c", "Ticker": "FB", "Date": "2019-04-23T00:00:00", "key": "20190423FB", "labelr0": 1.2896825396825415, "labelr1": -0.6529546196539279, "labelr2": 5.849490634242513, "labelr3": -0.9158646383110742, "labelr4": 1.71810538409316, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.333, "compound": -0.4588, "0_day_return": 1.2896825396825349, "1_day_return": 1.2896825396825349, "2_day_return": 5.158341495266083, "3_day_return": 4.195233431276546, "4_day_return": 5.985417346827737, "label": 1, "return": -0.002191763296964875, "excess_return": 1.2918743029795, "count_of_word": 1299, "pred": -1, "prof-1": 0.5692364000000001, "prof1": 0.43076357, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.504912340009291, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.495087659990709, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5692364000000001, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.43076357, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.5588422, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.44115788, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.43114832, "tr_prof1": 0.56885165, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.6528687, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.34713125, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.57204175, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.42795829999999996, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.4349367, "headline_prof21": 0.5650633, "textplusheadline_pred": -1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.5297643, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.47023574, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.6371336999999999, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.36286628, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.81844544, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.1815546, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 1.2896825396825349, "returnpredvader": -1.2896825396825349, "returnpredsgd": -1.2896825396825349, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0060805800655792, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0105152803343167, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0043332042200794, "cumreturn1b": 1.3736238319990655, "cumreturn1d": 1.1146586312655706, "cumreturn1e": 1.081863482990273, "cumreturndow": 1.1662211073889908, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1392434291096585}, {"Unnamed: 0": 5588, "Unnamed: 0.1": 5588, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 5588, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 5588, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 5588, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 5588, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 5588, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 5588, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 5588, "level_0": 5588, "index": 5588, "text": "APRIL 24 (REUTERS) - THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC ON WEDNESDAY RAISED ITS 2019 FORECASTS FOR ADJUSTED PROFIT AND REVENUE ON THE BACK OF ITS $1.7 BILLION DEAL TO BUY BRAMMER BIO, AND BEAT THE AVERAGE ANALYST ESTIMATE FOR FIRST-QUARTER PROFIT.

REUTERS/DADO RUVIC/ILLUSTRATION  APPLE HAS WRESTLED WITH A SLOWDOWN IN IPHONE SALES IN KEY MARKETS SUCH AS CHINA AND SAW ITS FIRST EVER YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE IN IPHONE REVENUE FOR THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON.  THE SLOWDOWN STEMMED IN PART FROM THE IPHONE\u2019S HIGH COST AND COMPETITION FROM RIVALS SUCH AS HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES CO LTD, XIAOMI CORP, OPPO AND VIVO - ALL OF WHICH SELL CHEAPER PHONES WITH FEATURES SIMILAR TO THE IPHONE.  BUT COOK SAID PRICE ADJUSTMENTS IN CHINA, ALONG WITH LOWER CHINESE TAXES ON THE IPHONE AND THE TRADE-IN AND FINANCING DEALS APPLE OFFERED, HELPED IPHONE SALES START TO RECOVER TOWARD THE END OF THE QUARTER.

TOM PLUMB, FOUNDER OF WISCONSIN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND AN APPLE SHAREHOLDER, SAID THE RESULTS LOOKED GOOD, ESPECIALLY THE UPTICK TOWARD THE END OF THE QUARTER. BUT OTHER SHAREHOLDERS SUCH AS BRIAN PIRRI, A PRINCIPAL AT APPLE SHAREHOLDER NEW ENGLAND INVESTMENT AND RETIREMENT GROUP, SAID THEY TOOK THE RESULTS WITH A \u201cGRAIN OF SALT\u201d BECAUSE EXPECTATIONS WERE LOW HEADING INTO THE REPORT.  \u201cI DON\u2019T THINK THE PHONES ARE THE ANSWER. (APPLE) IS GOING TO NEED TO CONTINUE TO INNOVATE, AND I DON\u2019T SEE A TON OUT OF THIS REPORT THAT EXCITES ME,\u201d PIRRI SAID.

THE IRANIAN FOREIGN INVESTMENT COMPANY ALSO HOLDS A LEGACY 15% STAKE THAT GOES BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FUNDING OF THE MINE, WHICH COULD HAVE DETERRED SOME POTENTIAL BUYERS.  THE OTHER SHAREHOLDERS ARE THE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OF SOUTH AFRICA (10%) AND INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS (3%).  CHINA IS TARGETING NUCLEAR POWER AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO FOSSIL FUELS. IT WAS THE ONLY OBVIOUS BUYER OF THE SHARES IN THE ROS SING MINE.  ROSSING HAS BEEN OPERATING SINCE 1976 AND HAS PRODUCED MORE URANIUM THAN ANY OTHER MINE. IT EMPLOYS AROUND 1,000 WORKERS AND CAN CARRY ON PRODUCING UNTIL 2025.  THE SALE AGREEMENT COMPRISES AN INITIAL CASH PAYMENT OF $6.5 MILLION, PAYABLE AT COMPLETION, AND A CONTINGENT PAYMENT OF UP TO $100 MILLION FOLLOWING COMPLETION.  THE CONTINGENT PAYMENT IS LINKED TO URANIUM SPOT PRICES AND ROOFING\u2019S NET INCOME DURING THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS.  WHILE CHINA IS A BIG SOURCE OF URANIUM DEMAND, THE MARKET HAS LANGUISHED AS WESTERN COUNTRIES TURN AWAY FROM THE ENERGY SOURCE AND TRADE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA ARE GENERALLY DISRUPTING COMMODITIES TRADE.

ONE OF THE FIRST FIRMS TO JOIN AN ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD PROGRAMME THAT PROVIDES YEARS OF CONSUMER SHOPPING HISTORY, SNACK FOOD CHAIN BESTORE CO LTD PLANS TO LINK FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY WITH THE E-COMMERCE GIANT\u2019S ACCOUNT DATA BY THE YEAR\u2019S END.  FOR CUSTOMERS OPTING TO HAVE THEIR FACIAL DATA IN BESTORE\u2019S SYSTEMS, THAT MEANS SHOP ASSISTANTS WILL BE ABLE TO CHECK ON WHAT FOOD THEY LIKE THE MOMENT THEY ENTER ONE OF ITS STORES.  BESTORE, WHICH ALREADY OFFERS CUSTOMERS THE OPTION OF PAYING WITH ALIBABA\u2019S FACE SCANNING TABLETS, HAS ALSO STARTED USING ALIBABA\u2019S OTHER SERVICES FOR MORE SUCCESSFUL MARKETING.  IT CAN NOW ARRANGE FOR A PERSON WHO LIKES SALTY FOOD, OWNS AN SUV AND PROBABLY HAS A FAMILY TO RECEIVE AN AD SUGGESTING SUITABLE BESTORE SNACKS FOR A SPRING HOLIDAY ROAD TRIP, HUANG XIAO, BESTORE\u2019S HEAD OF E-COMMERCE, TOLD REUTERS.  \u201cWITH THE PARTNERSHIP, OUR STRATEGIES ARE MORE FOCUSED, SALES BEHAVIOURS ARE MORE TARGETED AND RESOURCES ARE BETTER ALLOCATED,\u201d HUANG SAID.  THE ALIBABA PROGRAMME, CALLED A100 AND WHICH COUNTS NESTLE SA AND PROCTER & GAMBLE CO AS CLIENTS, IS PART OF A MAJOR PUSH BY E-COMMERCE GIANTS IN CHINA TO RETOOL THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH MERCHANTS - OFFERING THEM A TROVE OF SHOPPER DATA IN RETURN FOR BROADER AND CLOSER PARTNERSHIPS.  THE SHIFT IS INTEGRAL TO WHAT CHINESE E-COMMERCE FIRMS CALL \u2018NEW RETAIL\u2019 OR \u2018BOUNDARY-LESS RETAIL\u2019 - THE MARRYING OF DATA AVAILABLE FROM INTERNET SHOPPING AND GATHERED THROUGH BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORES TO PROVIDE HIGHLY PERSONALISED SERVICES.  IT HAS BEEN ENABLED BY THE WIDESPREAD USE OF PAYMENTS BY SMARTPHONE, THE RISE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AND CHINESE CONSUMER TOLERANCE OF DATA-SHARING BETWEEN BUSINESSES.  OTHER SERVICES ALIBABA OFFERS TO RETAIL CLIENTS INCLUDE SHOPPER MOVEMENT \u2018HEAT MAPS\u2019 TO HELP STORES BETTER DESIGN THE LAYOUT OF PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS ITS CHAT APP DINGTALK TO COMMUNICATE WITHIN THEIR OWN COMPANIES AND WITH CUSTOMERS.  SEEKING MORE DATA  KEEPING MERCHANTS HAPPY AND SIGNING THEM UP FOR MORE SERVICES HAS TAKEN ON ADDED URGENCY FOR ALIBABA AND RIVAL JD.COM .  BOTH ARE SEEKING TO DIVERSIFY AMID SLOWING E-COMMERCE REVENUE GROWTH AT HOME - DUE IN PART TO SATURATED MARKETS IN CHINA\u2019S BIGGEST CITIES, FLAGGING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE FROM THE U.S.-CHINA TRADE WAR AND INCREASED COMPETITION FROM RIVALS SUCH AS NEWLY LISTED PINDUODUO INC.  \u201cFOR ALIBABA AND JD.COM THIS IS CRITICAL FOR THEIR OVERALL ECOSYSTEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE PRETTY MUCH ALREADY EXHAUSTED THE ONLINE GROWTH,\u201d SAID BEIJING-BASED JASON DING, PARTNER AT CONSULTING FIRM BAIN & COMPANY.  BY PROVIDING DATA-DRIVEN TOOLS TO RETAIL STORES, E-COMMERCE FIRMS CAN EXPAND THE AMOUNT OF DATA COLLECTED. \u201cIT\u2019S NOT JUST ABOUT MONEY, IT\u2019S ABOUT CONTINUING TO GROW, AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL FIND A WAY TO MONETISE THAT,\u201d HE SAID.  JD.COM, WHICH PROVIDES SIMILAR SERVICES TO ALIBABA, SAYS IT HELPED U.S. DIAPER BRAND \u201cHUGGIES\u201d WORK OUT WHY CHINESE COMPETITORS WERE RISING IN POPULARITY, PROMPTING HUGGIES TO CHANGE TO A MATERIAL THAT IS MORE ABSORBENT AND COMFORTABLE WHEN WET. THAT CONTRIBUTED TO A 60% PERCENT RISE IN HUGGIES SALES ON JD.COM IN 2018, THE CHINESE FIRM SAID.  A SPOKESMAN FOR KIMBERLY CLARK, WHICH OWNS THE HUGGIES BRAND, DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE DETAILS OF ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH JD.COM.  AFTER A TRIAL RUN OF A NEW PRODUCT, JD.COM SAID IT CREATES A \u2018PROFILE\u2019 OF A POTENTIAL BUYER BASED ON EARLY SALES THAT IS CROSS-CHECKED WITH ITS ENTIRE USERBASE, BEFORE TARGETED ADS ARE SENT TO CLOSE MATCHES.  OTHER TOOLS JD.COM OFFERS TO RETAIL CLIENTS INCLUDE AN CUSTOMER SERVICE CHATBOT POWERED BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT CAN THE \u201cSENSE\u201d THE MOOD OF CUSTOMERS, AND ADJUST ITS TONE TO APPEAR MORE EMPATHETIC.  IT HAS ALSO ROLLED OUT CHECKOUTS IN SOME HONG KONG CONVENIENCE STORES THAT CAN SCAN SEVERAL ITEMS AT ONCE AND CHARGE CUSTOMERS USING THEIR ID-LINKED ACCOUNTS, WHICH IT SAYS CUTS THE AVERAGE CHECKOUT TIME BY 30%.  FREE FOR NOW  BOTH JD.COM AND ALIBABA EXECUTIVES SAY THEY ARE NOT CHARGING COMPANIES FOR MOST DATA SERVICES AT THE MOMENT, NOTING THE NEW PARTNERSHIPS FACILITATE SALES OF OTHER SERVICES SUCH AS CLOUD COMPUTING AND LOGISTICS.  NESTLE, WHICH SELLS HAAGEN DAAZ AND NESPRESSO THROUGH THIRD-PARTY RETAIL LOCATIONS IN CHINA, SAYS IT NOW HAS ONE WAREHOUSE INSTEAD OF FOUR AFTER TAPPING INTO DATA AT ALIBABA DISTRIBUTION CENTERS WHICH GIVE REAL-TIME UPDATES ON ORDERS.  \u201cYOU DON\u2019T HAVE TO CARRY HUGE INVENTORY IN YOUR WAREHOUSE,\u201d SAID RASHID QURESHI, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF NESTLE\u2019S GREATER CHINA BUSINESS, ADDING IT\u2019S THE FIRST TIME NESTLE HAS INTEGRATED AN E-COMMERCE FIRM\u2019S DATA INTO ITS OWN SYSTEMS.  WHERE PREVIOUSLY BESTORE AND NESTLE WOULD HAVE DEALT WITH DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ALIBABA EMPIRE FOR DELIVERY, PAYMENTS, CLOUD COMPUTING AND MESSAGING, THEY NOW WORK WITH ONE ALIBABA TEAM DEDICATED TO THEIR COMPANY WHICH ORGANISES A RANGE OF TAILORED SERVICES.  \u201cIT\u2019S A CHANGE THAT SUBVERTS THE WAY OUR ENTIRE COMPANY HAS OPERATED,\u201d ALIBABA\u2019S JET JING TOLD REUTERS IN AN INTERVIEW. JING, FORMERLY PRESIDENT OF ALIBABA\u2019S RETAIL SITE TMALL, HAS SINCE BECOME ASSISTANT TO CEO DANIEL ZHANG.  ALIBABA HAS NOT DISCLOSED HOW MANY COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN ITS A100 PROGRAMME, BUT SOME ANALYSTS SAY FOR NOW ONLY BIG FIRMS WILL BE ABLE TO BENEFIT AS SMALLER FIRMS DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO JUSTIFY MAJOR ORGANISATIONAL CHANGES.  ONE RISK FOR RETAILERS, HOWEVER, IS THAT THEY MAY BECOME OVERLY DEPENDENT ON THEIR E-COMMERCE PARTNERS.  THE CHINESE MARKET REMAINS TOUGH FOR BRANDS TO CRACK INDEPENDENTLY AND ALIBABA AND JD.COM REPRESENT THE TWO BIGGEST ONLINE RETAIL CHANNELS INTO THE COUNTRY. IN THE FACE OF SUCH TOUGH COMPETITION, AMAZON.COM INC SAID IN APRIL IT IS SHUTTING ITS CHINA ONLINE STORE.  \u201cIT\u2019S A MUST FOR THE BRANDS TO BE INVOLVED,\u201d SAYS BAIN & COMPANY\u2019S DING. \u201cBUT EVERYONE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A BALANCE AND NOT PUT THEIR EGGS IN ONE BASKET.\u201d  MORE BROADLY, QUESTIONS REMAIN OVER HOW BIG E-COMMERCE FIRMS MANAGE THEIR DATA IN A WAY THAT IS FAIR TO ALL PARTIES USING THEIR SERVICES.

REUTERS/STEFANO RELLANDINI/FILE PHOTO  IN A STATEMENT, THE FUND DID NOT NAME THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUT SOURCES HAD TOLD REUTERS LAST WEEK THAT U.S. PRIVATE EQUITY FUND APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, WHICH ALREADY OWNS CARIGE\u2019S INSURANCE UNITS, HAD PRESENTED ITS OFFER.  THE FITD DID NOT GIVE A REASON FOR THE REJECTION ON MONDAY BUT ONLY SAID THAT IT \u201cWAS NOT IN A POSITION TO ACCEPT A PRIVATE EQUITY FUND\u2019S DRAFT PLAN IN ITS CURRENT STATE\u201d.  HOWEVER, ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO THE BANK SAID APOLLO WAS EXPECTED TO PRESENT A NEW RESCUE PLAN IN THE COMING HOURS.  FITD ADDED IT WAS READY TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS INVOLVING THE BANK\u2019S CURRENT SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER PRIVATE OR PUBLIC INVESTORS.  CARIGE, WHICH WAS PLACED UNDER SPECIAL ADMINISTRATION BY THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK IN JANUARY, HAS A CAPITAL SHORTFALL OF 630 MILLION EUROS ($717 MILLION).  CARIGE\u2019S TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATORS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND A BUYER FOR MONTHS BUT THEIR EFFORTS WERE THROWN INTO DISARRAY LAST MONTH WHEN BLACKROCK PULLED OUT OF A PROPOSED RESCUE PLAN.  THAT PLAN INCLUDED THE CONVERSION INTO EQUITY OF A 320 MILLION EURO BOND HELD BY THE FITD DEPOSIT GUARANTEE FUND.  FITD SAID IT WOULD START A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF CARIGE\u2019S  CAPITAL NEEDS ON TUESDAY.  BANK RESCUES ARE SENSITIVE IN ITALY, WHERE AN ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT GOVERNMENT HAS CAMPAIGNED AGAINST EU \u201cBAIL-IN\u201d RULES THAT LIMIT THE USE OF PUBLIC MONEY TO PROP UP AILING LENDERS.  EU ANTITRUST REGULATORS BLOCKED THE RESCUE OF TERCAS IN 2015 BECAUSE IT WAS CARRIED OUT WITH MONEY FROM FITD.  BRUSSELS CONSIDERED THE BAILOUT BREACHED EU STATE AID RULES BECAUSE IT SAID THE FUND HAD ACTED ON BEHALF OF THE ITALIAN STATE, EFFECTIVELY PROVIDING UNFAIR SUBSIDIES TO THE BANK.  THE EU GENERAL COURT OVERTURNED THAT DECISION IN MARCH, RULING THAT THE FUND HAD ACTED INDEPENDENTLY.  A SOURCE CLOSE TO THE FITD, SAID ON MONDAY, THAT THANKS TO THIS RULING, THE FITD, WHICH HAS 1.5 BILLION EUROS OF LIQUIDITY, COULD INJECT CASH INTO CARIGE WITHOUT BREAKING EU ANTITRUST RULES.  HOWEVER, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION APPEALED AGAINST THE EU COURT RULING LAST MONTH, PAVING THE WAY FOR A LONG LEGAL DISPUTE WHICH COULD PREVENT THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT FROM USING THE EASIER TERMS OF THE TERCAS RESCUE FOR FUTURE BANK BAILOUTS.", "Ticker": "APO", "Date": "2019-06-24T00:00:00", "key": "20190624APO", "labelr0": -2.0576131687242882, "labelr1": 0.1500600240095953, "labelr2": 0.4495055439017252, "labelr3": 2.177804295942712, "labelr4": 0.14598540145984573, "pos": 0.275, "neg": 0.225, "compound": 0.1531, "0_day_return": -2.0576131687242927, "1_day_return": 0.15006002400959062, "2_day_return": 0.6002400960384291, "3_day_return": 2.7911164465786342, "4_day_return": 2.9411764705882253, "label": 1, "return": -0.009496397395675671, "excess_return": 0.1595564214052663, "count_of_word": 407, "pred": -1, "prof-1": 0.5551520000000001, "prof1": 0.44484797, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5304807185144759, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4695192814855241, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5551520000000001, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.44484797, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.51086146, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.4891385, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.48331523, "tr_prof1": 0.5166847, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5535017, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.4464983, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.53343856, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.46656149999999996, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.45202598, "headline_prof21": 0.54797405, "textplusheadline_pred": -1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.5872550999999999, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.41274482, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.41140392, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.5885961, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.741159, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.25884107, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": 0.15006002400959062, "returnpredvader": 0.15006002400959062, "returnpredsgd": -0.15006002400959062, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0046867190836073, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0141914950504791, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9991407428973016, "cumreturn1b": 1.6833762241059216, "cumreturn1d": 1.116187608997288, "cumreturn1e": 1.1925614808340328, "cumreturndow": 1.1622888369037914, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1371518684339104}, {"Unnamed: 0": 8407, "Unnamed: 0.1": 8407, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 8407, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 8407, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 8407, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 8407, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8407, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8407, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8407, "level_0": 8407, "index": 8407, "text": "  TECH LEADS ALL 3 MAJOR U.S. INDEXES LOWER    ALLERGAN JUMPS ON ABBVIE\u2019S $63 BLN PURCHASE ANNOUNCEMENT    FED CHAIR POWELL DUE TO SPEAK AT 1:00 P.M.

APPLE SAID IVE WILL CONTINUE WORK ON ITS PRODUCTS AT HIS NEW VENTURE, BUT SHARES FELL AS MUCH AS 1.5% TO $197.44 IN AFTER-MARKET TRADING, WIPING ABOUT $9 BILLION FROM THE FIRM\u2019S VALUE.  IVE SPENT NEARLY THREE DECADES AT APPLE, LEADING THE DESIGN OF THE CANDY-COLORED IMACS THAT HELPED APPLE RE-EMERGE FROM NEAR DEATH IN THE 1990S TO THE IPHONE, REGARDED BY SOME EXPERTS AS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL CONSUMER PRODUCTS OF ALL TIME.  \u201cIT\u2019S THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE OF SOMEBODY WHO WAS A CORE PART OF THE GROWTH STORY\u201d UNDER JOBS, SAID BEN BAJARIN, ANALYST WITH CREATIVE STRATEGIES.  IVE JOINED APPLE IN 1992 AND LED APPLE\u2019S DESIGN TEAMS SINCE 1996. HE BECAME CHIEF DESIGN OFFICER IN 2015.  IVE\u2019S NEW COMPANY WILL BE CALLED LOVEFROM, THE FINANCIAL TIMES REPORTED, QUOTING IVE AS SAYING IT WOULD BE BASED IN CALIFORNIA \u201cFOR NOW.\u201d IVE TOLD THE NEWSPAPER HE WOULD WORK ON APPLE DEVICES IN ADDITION TO UNSPECIFIED \u201cPERSONAL PASSIONS\u201d AND NON-APPLE PROJECTS.  \u201cI HAVE THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE IN MY DESIGNER COLLEAGUES AT APPLE, WHO REMAIN MY CLOSEST FRIENDS, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM FOR MANY YEARS TO COME,\u201d IVE SAID.  IVE\u2019S DEPARTURE COMES AMID FALLING IPHONE SALES, INCLUDING A RECORD DROP IN APPLE\u2019S MOST RECENT QUARTER. SALES OF SOME NEWER HARDWARE PRODUCTS SUCH AS THE APPLE WATCH AND ITS WIRELESS AIRPODS HEADPHONES ARE EXPANDING, BUT APPLE HAS TURNED ITS ATTENTION TO GROWING ITS SERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDES APPLE MUSIC AND ICLOUD.  NEHAL CHOKSHI, AN ANALYST WITH MAXIM GROUP, SAID THAT DESPITE IVE\u2019S KEY ROLE IN APPLE HISTORY, HIS DEPARTURE WILL NOT HURT THE IPHONE MAKER.  \u201cI WOULD VIEW IT AS JONY IVE LOOKING TO GET PAID MARKET RATES FOR HIS DESIGN EXPERTISE FROM APPLE, WITH THE RIGHT TO ALLOW OTHER COMPANIES - NOT COMPETITORS TO APPLE - TO LEVERAGE THAT EXPERTISE,\u201d CHOKSHI SAID.  CONTINUITY AFTER JOBS  JOBS DEEPLY INVOLVED HIMSELF IN APPLE\u2019S DESIGN PROCESS, SOMETIMES VISITING APPLE\u2019S DESIGN STUDIOS DAILY TO OFFER IVE FEEDBACK. CHIEF EXECUTIVE TIM COOK, TO WHOM IVE NOW REPORTS, HAS NOT DONE THE SAME.  AFTER JOBS\u2019 DEATH, PUNDITS QUESTIONED WHETHER APPLE COULD CONTINUE JOBS\u2019 PACE OF NEW PRODUCTS. IVE BECAME A SYMBOL OF CONTINUITY, BRIDGING THE JOBS AND COOK ERAS.  BUT ALAN CANNISTRARO, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF ONLINE VIDEO DISCOVERY PLATFORM RHEO WHO PREVIOUSLY WORKED AT APPLE FOR A DOZEN YEARS, SAID APPLE EMPLOYEES KNEW IVE HAD TAKEN ON FEWER DAY-TO-DAY DESIGN DUTIES IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. AROUND 2015, CANNISTRARO WOULD OFTEN SEE IVE AT A HIGH-END FITNESS GYM ON MARKET STREET IN SAN FRANCISCO DOING MID-MORNING WORKOUTS.  \u201cWHEN I WOULD SEE HIM THERE, TWO DAYS A WEEK OR MORE, THAT JUST TOLD ME HE HAD TAKEN A STEP BACK,\u201d CANNISTRARO SAID.  IVE CAME TO OVERSEE BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE DESIGN AT APPLE, BUT THE COMPANY LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR HIS DEPARTURE OVER SEVERAL YEARS. DURING 2015, IVE HANDED OFF SOME DUTIES TO OTHER EXECUTIVES WHILE HE FINISHED APPLE\u2019S NEW CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, APPLE PARK.  ONE OF THOSE EXECUTIVES WAS ALAN DYE, WHO APPLE ON THURSDAY SAID WILL BECOME VICE PRESIDENT OF HUMAN INTERFACE DESIGN. THE COMPANY APPOINTED EVANS HANKEY AS VICE PRESIDENT OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGN. BOTH HAVE \u201cPLAYED KEY LEADERSHIP ROLES\u201d IN APPLE\u2019S DESIGN TEAM FOR YEARS, THE COMPANY SAID.  CANNISTRARO, THE FORMER APPLE EMPLOYEE, SAID HANKEY STOOD OUT AS \u201cEXCEPTIONAL\u201d AMONG APPLE\u2019S ALREADY STRONG DESIGN TEAMS. AROUND 2008, AS APPLE READIED NEW IMACS, HANKEY DUG IN ON AN IDEA TO MAKE APPLE PRODUCTS TALK TO EACH OTHER AS A HOME CONTROL SYSTEM.  THE EFFORT, WHICH WAS NEVER RELEASED, WAS NOT PART OF HANKEY\u2019S OFFICIAL DUTIES. BUT SHE TOOK AN INTEREST ANYWAY BECAUSE OF HER \u201cVERY LONG-TERM VISION KIND OF ROLE \u2013 LOOKING FOR SEEDS THAT COULD TURN INTO SOMETHING BIGGER, OR MAYBE PLANT SOME SEEDS, TOO,\u201d CANNISTRARO SAID.  THE ELEVATION OF DYE AND HANKEY COULD REIGNITE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN APPLE\u2019S DESIGN TEAMS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES. BOTH WILL REPORT TO CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER JEFF WILLIAMS, WHO WILL IN TURN HAND OFF LOGISTICS AND SUPPLY CHAIN DUTIES TO SABIH KHAN, NEWLY NAMED SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF OPERATIONS.

FACEBOOK, AMAZON AND GOOGLE-OWNER ALPHABET , ALL PART OF THE SO-CALLED FANG GROUP OF WIDELY HELD STOCKS, HAVE JUMPED OVER 5% SO FAR IN JULY, WITH INVESTORS INCREASINGLY WILLING TO BET ON THE VOLATILE NAMES THANKS TO EXPECTATIONS THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL CUT RATES LATER THIS MONTH BY AS MUCH AS HALF A PERCENTAGE POINT TO SUPPORT ECONOMIC GROWTH.  THE FANG COMPANIES, COMBINED WITH INVESTOR FAVORITES APPLE AND MICROSOFT, ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 17% OF THE S&P 500\u2019S $26 TRILLION MARKET CAPITALIZATION, MAKING REACTION TO THEIR QUARTERLY RESULTS KEY TO WALL STREET SENTIMENT.  NETFLIX HAS BEEN THE FANG GROUP\u2019S POOREST PERFORMER THIS MONTH, UP JUST 0.2% AS INVESTORS WORRY THAT LOOMING COMPETITION FROM WALT DISNEY CO IN VIDEO STREAMING COULD LIMIT ITS ALREADY COOLING SUBSCRIBER GROWTH.  STILL, THE LEADING VIDEO ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY IS UP 2% SINCE ITS WEAKER-THAN-EXPECTED QUARTERLY REPORT IN APRIL, AND UP 37% YEAR TO DATE.

MARK STOECKLE, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT ADAMS FUNDS, SAID HIS DIVERSIFIED EQUITY FUND IS OVERWEIGHT NETFLIX DUE IN PART TO ITS STRONG ORIGINAL CONTENT. THE FUND IS UNDERWEIGHT FACEBOOK ON EXPECTATIONS THAT THE COMPANY HAS NOT FULLY RECOGNIZED THE REGULATORY CHALLENGES IT FACES, INCLUDING IN RELATION TO ITS PLAN TO LAUNCH A CRYPTOCURRENCY, WHICH HAS FACED A BACKLASH FROM GOVERNMENTS AND CENTRAL BANKERS SINCE IT WAS UNVEILED LAST MONTH.  \u201cWHO AT FACEBOOK THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO BRING UP THIS LIBRA CRYPTOCURRENCY RIGHT NOW? THE NICEST WAY TO SAY IT IS THAT IT WAS ILL-ADVISED, GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT\u2019S ON THEIR PLATE,\u201d STOECKLE SAID.

THAT COMPARES TO AN AVERAGE INCREASE OF 0.6% IN THE FOLLOWING TRADING DAY ACROSS ALL QUARTERS FOR NETFLIX.  FACEBOOK IS TO POST ITS RESULTS ON JULY 24, FOLLOWED BY AMAZON AND ALPHABET ON JULY 25. FACEBOOK AND ALPHABET FACE CHALLENGES INCLUDING CALLS FOR INCREASED REGULATION, WHILE INVESTORS WORRY THAT AMAZON\u2019S RACE TO EXPAND ONE-DAY SHIPPING WILL CUT INTO ITS PROFITS JUST AS COMPETITORS INCLUDING WALMART AND TARGET IMPROVE THEIR OWN ONLINE SALES AND DELIVERIES.  YEAR-TO-DATE, AMAZON HAS SURGED 35% AND IS LESS THAN 2% BELOW ITS RECORD HIGH SET LAST SEPTEMBER.  FACEBOOK HAS RALLIED 56% IN 2019 AND IS 6% SHORT OF THE RECORD HIGH IT SET A YEAR AGO, JUST BEFORE IT WARNED OF A MULTI-YEAR SQUEEZE ON ITS BUSINESS MARGINS, SENDING ITS STOCK INTO MONTHS OF DECLINE AS INVESTORS WORRIED ABOUT FALLOUT FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S MISHANDLING OF USERS\u2019 PERSONAL INFORMATION.  EVEN AFTER THEIR RALLIES THIS YEAR, ALPHABET, NETFLIX AND AMAZON ARE TRADING AT FORWARD PRICE/EARNINGS MULTIPLES BELOW THEIR TWO-YEAR AVERAGES.

ANALYSTS EXPECT MICROSOFT, THE ONLY U.S. COMPANY WITH A STOCK MARKET VALUE GREATER THAN $1 TRILLION, TO POST A 9% INCREASE IN QUARTERLY REVENUE TO $32.8 BILLION, WITH STRONG GROWTH IN CLOUD COMPUTING MAKING THAT BUSINESS LARGER THAN ITS WINDOWS BUSINESS FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.

(REUTERS) - GENERAL MOTORS CO (GM.N) UNVEILED ON THURSDAY ITS NEWLY DESIGNED MID-ENGINE 2020 CORVETTE IN A SPLASHY TRIBUTE TO ITS EMBLEMATIC SPORTS CAR, EVEN AS THE NO. 1 U.S. AUTOMAKER FACES MOUNTING PRESSURES IN A SLUGGISH AND UNCERTAIN GLOBAL SALES ENVIRONMENT.  IN A GLITZY PRESENTATION IN ORANGE COUNTY OUTSIDE LOS ANGELES, THE EIGHTH GENERATION OF THE 66-YEAR-OLD \u201cVETTE,\u201d IN RED, WHITE, AND BLUE, ROARED DOWN A RUNWAY STOPPING SHORT BEFORE AN AUDIENCE OF CORVETTE ENTHUSIASTS, GM EXECUTIVES, DEALERS AND MEDIA.  REVVED UP TO TAKE ON HIGH-PERFORMANCE EUROPEAN RIVALS, THE NEW CORVETTE, DUBBED THE C8, PROVIDES A BREATH OF FRESH AIR TO GM, WHICH ALONG WITH OTHER CARMAKERS FACES SLOWING SALES AND NEW FINANCIAL PRESSURES RELATED TO GLOBAL TRADE, ELECTRIFICATION AND UNRESOLVED EMISSION STANDARDS.  WITH A 495 HORSEPOWER, V8 ENGINE AND DUAL CLUTCH, THE CORVETTE WILL GO FROM ZERO TO 60 MPH IN UNDER 3 SECONDS, EXECUTIVES SAID, ADDING THAT THE STARTING PRICE IN THE UNITED STATES WILL BE LESS THAN $60,000.  THE SPORTS CAR GIVES THE DETROIT AUTOMAKER A SORELY NEEDED SHOT IN THE ARM AFTER A DIFFICULT YEAR, EDMUNDS ANALYST JESSICA CALDWELL SAID.  \u201cA CORVETTE IS NOT GOING TO HELP PAD MARGINS THE WAY A SILVERADO WOULD,\u201d CALDWELL SAID. \u201cBUT FROM AN IMAGE AND EXCITEMENT STANDPOINT ... THAT HALO EFFECT THE CORVETTE FILLS IS UNIQUE.\u201d  THE CHEVY SILVERADO FULL-SIZE PICKUP TRUCK, A PERENNIAL BEST-SELLER, RANKS AMONG GM\u2019S MOST PROFITABLE VEHICLES.  SINCE 2013, GM HAS SOLD OVER 100,000 C7-MODEL CORVETTES IN THE UNITED STATES, ACCORDING TO EDMUNDS. THE CAR CEASED PRODUCTION THIS SUMMER.  BIDDING ADIEU TO THE FRONT-ENGINE CONFIGURATION THAT HAS MARKED THE TWO-SEATER SINCE ITS APPEARANCE IN 1953, GM HAS OPTED FOR A MID-ENGINE ARCHITECTURE FOR BETTER HANDLING AND WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION, THE CHOICE OF MANY EUROPEAN SPORTS CARMAKERS.  CORVETTE CHIEF ENGINEER TADGE JUECHTER SAID GM HAD REACHED THE LIMITS OF WHAT COULD BE DONE WITH THE FRONT ENGINE, BUT THAT THE NEW MID-ENGINE DESIGN ALLOWED A \u201cQUANTUM LEAP FORWARD IN DRIVING DYNAMICS.\u201d  FAR BELOW THE $113,000 STARTING PRICE FOR THE REAR-ENGINE PORSCHE 911, THE CORVETTE\u2019S OPENING PRICE OF UNDER $60,000 COULD ATTRACT A YOUNGER BUYER LURED IN RECENT YEARS TO HIGH PERFORMANCE VEHICLES FROM TESLA INC (TSLA.O) AND OTHERS.  ONE SUCH POTENTIAL CUSTOMER, WHO PROFESSED TO BE A TESLA FAN AS WELL, WAS JONATHAN OPATOWSKY, 22. HE DROVE THREE HOURS TO THE UNVEILING IN HIS DAD\u2019S 2017 GRAND SPORT - WITH HIS MOM IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.  MARK REUSS, PRESIDENT OF GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY, GESTURES NEXT TO THE REDESIGNED MID-ENGINE C8 CORVETTE, THE 2020 CHEVROLET CORVETTE STINGRAY, IN TUSTIN, CALIFORNIA, U.S. JULY 18, 2019. REUTERS/MIKE BLAKE  OPATOWSKY, WHOSE FATHER WAS ABSENT DUE TO WORK, SAID HIS DAD FIRST LET HIM DRIVE HIS 2014 STINGRAY WHEN HE WAS ONLY 17.  \u201cHE WAS SHOCKED. HE DIDN\u2019T THINK I\u2019D BE ABLE TO DRIVE IT LIKE I DID,\u201d HE SAID.  THE LAUNCH  THE MASSIVE HANGAR WHERE THE GASOLINE-FUELED CORVETTE TOOK THE STAGE IS LESS THAN 40 MILES (64 KM) FROM TESLA\u2019S SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DESIGN CENTER, WHERE CHIEF EXECUTIVE ELON MUSK IN 2017 UNVEILED A PROTOTYPE OF A NEW ELECTRIC ROADSTER - DUBBED \u201cTHE QUICKEST CAR IN THE WORLD\u201d BY THE AUTOMAKER.  WHETHER THE CORVETTE CAN GENERATE ENOUGH EXCITEMENT TO ATTRACT EVEN THE LOYAL BUYERS OF THE PRICIER EUROPEAN BRANDS - FROM FERRARI, PORSCHE, LAMBORGHINI, ASTON MARTIN, MCCLAREN AND LOTUS - REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  GM HAS TEASED THE LAUNCH FOR MONTHS.  IN APRIL, JUECHTER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER MARY BARRA DROVE A CAMOUFLAGED C8 CORVETTE THROUGH NEW YORK\u2019S TIMES SQUARE DURING RUSH HOUR IN A HIGH-PROFILE TEASE.  ALMOST MYTHIC IN THE AMERICAN IMAGINATION, THE CAR HAS BEEN IMMORTALIZED IN TELEVISION AND FILM FROM \u201cROUTE 66\u201d AND \u201cHOT RODS TO HELL\u201d IN THE 1960S TO \u201cCORVETTE SUMMER\u201d IN 1978.  EVEN ELVIS DROVE THE CORVETTE STINGRAY RACER IN THE 1967 FILM \u201cCLAMBAKE.\u201d  AHEAD OF THE EVENING LAUNCH INSIDE A VAST HANGAR, CORVETTE OWNERS MINGLED AT A \u201cCORVETTE CORRAL\u201d ALONGSIDE THEIR PARKED SPORTSCARS, WITH A SELECTION OF VINTAGE CORVETTES FROM GM INSIDE.  ONE ENTHUSIAST, JOHN ELEGANT, 72, SAID HE HAS BEEN WAITING SINCE HIS TEENAGE YEARS FOR A MID-ENGINE CORVETTE. OVER FOUR YEARS AGO, HE PUT DOWN A DEPOSIT WITH A DEALER FOR THE C8.  THE CO-FOUNDER OF HTTP://WWW.MIDENGINECORVETTEFORUM.COM AND CURRENT OWNER OF A CANARY YELLOW C7, ELEGANT PURCHASED HIS FIRST CORVETTE IN 1998 AFTER PUTTING HIS DAUGHTERS THROUGH COLLEGE.

REUTERS/DADO RUVIC/FILE PHOTO  AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT, FACEBOOK WILL AGREE TO CREATE A BOARD COMMITTEE ON PRIVACY AND WILL AGREE TO NEW EXECUTIVE CERTIFICATIONS THAT USERS\u2019 PRIVACY IS BEING PROPERLY PROTECTED, THE PEOPLE SAID.  FACEBOOK CHIEF EXECUTIVE MARK ZUCKERBERG WILL HAVE TO CERTIFY EVERY THREE MONTHS THAT THE COMPANY IS PROPERLY SAFEGUARDING USER PRIVACY, A PERSON BRIEFED ON THE MATTER SAID.  THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTED ON TUESDAY THAT THE FTC WILL ALLEGE FACEBOOK MISLED USERS ABOUT ITS HANDLING OF THEIR PHONE NUMBERS AND ITS USE OF TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION AS PART OF A WIDE-RANGING COMPLAINT THAT ACCOMPANIES A SETTLEMENT ENDING THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRIVACY PROBE, CITING TWO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER.  SEPARATELY, THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE A RELATED SETTLEMENT WITH FACEBOOK FOR AROUND $100 MILLION OVER ALLEGATIONS IT FAILED TO DISCLOSE RISKS TO INVESTORS OVER ITS PRIVACY PRACTICES. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTED THE SEC SETTLEMENT EARLIER.  THE POST ALSO REPORTED THE FTC ALSO PLANS TO ALLEGE FACEBOOK PROVIDED INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO ABOUT 30 MILLION USERS ABOUT A FACIAL RECOGNITION TOOL, AN ISSUE IDENTIFIED EARLIER BY CONSUMER REPORTS.  THE SETTLEMENT COMES AMID GROWING CONCERN AMONG U.S. POLICYMAKERS ABOUT THE PRIVACY OF ONLINE USERS AND HAVE SPARKED CALLS FOR NEW LEGAL PROTECTIONS IN CONGRESS. SEPARATELY, THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAID LATE TUESDAY IT IS LAUNCHING A BROAD ANTITRUST PROBE INTO THE COMPETITIVE PRACTICES OF LARGE TECH COMPANIES LIKE FACEBOOK.  TWO PEOPLE BRIEFED ON THE MATTER CONFIRMED THE POST REPORT THE FTC WILL NOT REQUIRE FACEBOOK TO ADMIT GUILT AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT. THE SETTLEMENT WILL NEED TO BE APPROVED BY A FEDERAL JUDGE AND WILL CONTAIN OTHER SIGNIFICANT ALLEGATIONS OF PRIVACY LAPSES, THE PEOPLE SAID.  THE FINE WILL MARK THE LARGEST CIVIL PENALTY EVER PAID TO THE FTC.  THE FTC AND FACEBOOK DECLINED TO COMMENT.  THE FTC CONFIRMED IN MARCH 2018 IT HAD OPENED AN INVESTIGATION INTO ALLEGATIONS FACEBOOK INAPPROPRIATELY SHARED INFORMATION BELONGING TO 87 MILLION USERS WITH THE NOW-DEFUNCT BRITISH POLITICAL CONSULTING FIRM CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA. THE PROBE HAS FOCUSED ON WHETHER THE DATA SHARING VIOLATED A 2011 CONSENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN FACEBOOK AND THE REGULATOR AND THEN WIDENED TO INCLUDE OTHER PRIVACY ALLEGATIONS.  A PERSON BRIEFED ON THE MATTER SAID THE PHONE NUMBER, FACIAL RECOGNITION AND TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION ISSUES WERE NOT PART OF THE INITIAL CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA PROBE.  SOME IN CONGRESS HAVE CRITICIZED THE REPORTED $5 BILLION PENALTY, NOTING FACEBOOK IN 2018 HAD $55.8 BILLION IN REVENUE AND $22.1 BILLION IN NET INCOME. SENATOR MARSHA BLACKBURN, A REPUBLICAN, SAID LAST WEEK THE FINE SHOULD BE $50 BILLION.  WHILE THE DEAL RESOLVES A MAJOR REGULATORY HEADACHE FOR FACEBOOK, THE SILICON VALLEY FIRM STILL FACES FURTHER POTENTIAL ANTITRUST PROBES AS THE FTC AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT UNDERTAKE A WIDE-RANGING REVIEW OF COMPETITION AMONG THE BIGGEST U.S. TECH COMPANIES. FACEBOOK IS ALSO FACING PUBLIC CRITICISM FROM PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND OTHERS ABOUT ITS PLANNED CRYPTOCURRENCY LIBRA OVER CONCERNS ABOUT PRIVACY AND MONEY LAUNDERING.  THE CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA MISSTEPS, AS WELL AS ANGER OVER HATE SPEECH AND MISINFORMATION ON ITS PLATFORM, HAVE PROMPTED CALLS FROM PEOPLE RANGING FROM PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN TO A FACEBOOK CO-FOUNDER, CHRIS HUGHES, FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO FORCE THE SOCIAL MEDIA GIANT TO SELL INSTAGRAM, WHICH IT BOUGHT IN 2012, AND WHATSAPP, PURCHASED IN 2014.

FABIO SCHVARTSMAN, VALE\u2019S THEN-CHIEF EXECUTIVE, SAID AT A NATIONALLY BROADCAST NEWS CONFERENCE DAYS AFTER THE DAM BURST IN LATE JANUARY THAT THE COMPANY HAD ALREADY DECOMMISSIONED NINE \u201cUPSTREAM DAMS\u201d IN THE WAKE OF A 2015 DISASTER INVOLVING THE SAME TYPE OF STRUCTURE, AND PLANNED TO DISMANTLE 10 MORE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THE COMPANY REPEATED THE CLAIM IN A STATEMENT ON ITS WEBSITE.  REUTERS ASKED VALE FOR DETAILS ON THESE MOVES ON FEBRUARY 5, SEVEN DAYS AFTER SCHVARTSMAN\u2019S NEWS CONFERENCE.  IN MARCH, SOME FIVE WEEKS LATER, VALE GAVE REUTERS A LIST OF NINE DAMS THAT IT SAID IT HAD CLOSED SINCE 2014, A YEAR BEFORE THE MARIANA DISASTER. FIVE WERE SMALLER STRUCTURES, CALLED DIKES, WHICH VALE SAID SHOULD BE CONSIDERED \u201cUPSTREAM DAMS,\u201d WHILE FOUR OTHERS WERE LISTED AS SINGLE-STEP DAMS, WHICH EXPERTS CONSIDER LESS DANGEROUS.  BUT EDUARDO LE\u00c3O, A DIRECTOR OF THE BRAZILIAN MINING REGULATOR ANM, AND ANOTHER EXPERT WHO REVIEWED THE LIST FOR REUTERS, SAID THAT THEY WERE ALL IN FACT SMALLER STRUCTURES AND NOT THE DANGEROUS UPSTREAM TYPE.  VALE ALSO LISTED THE 10 DAMS THAT IT SAID IT PLANNED TO CLOSE, INCLUDING THE COLLAPSED ONE AT BRUMADINHO.  BRAZILIAN PROSECUTORS NOW ARE LOOKING INTO SCHVARTSMAN\u2019S DECLARATION THAT VALE HAD ALREADY SHUTTERED NINE UPSTREAM DAMS IN RESPONSE TO THE 2015 COLLAPSE AS PART OF A WIDER CRIMINAL PROBE INTO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONDUCT, AN INDIVIDUAL CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION SAID. THE WIDENING OF THE PROBE HAS NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED.  FOR A GRAPHIC, CLICK TMSNRT.RS/308R1IY  THE 2015 COLLAPSE, AT ITS SAMARCO JOINT VENTURE WITH BHP GROUP, KILLED 19 PEOPLE NEAR THE TOWN OF MARIANA.  \u201cTHERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT MEASURES BEING TAKEN TO AVOID A REPETITION OF WHAT HAPPENED, BUT IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN TALK,\u201d THE SOURCE ADDED.  SCHVARTSMAN\u2019S REPRESENTATIVES AT THE LAW FIRM OF BOTTINI & TAMASAUSKAS DECLINED TO COMMENT.  IN A STATEMENT, VALE SAID THE ORIGINAL FIGURES THAT SCHVARTSMAN PROVIDED WERE BASED ON \u201cINFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME, PROVIDED BY EMPLOYEES FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S FERROUS METALS AREA AT THE TIME OF THE (NEWS CONFERENCE) AND THAT IT HAD LATER SENT REVISED DATA TO REUTERS AND OTHER NEWS OUTLETS.\u201d  VALE SAID ITS STATEMENTS SURROUNDING THE DAMS HAD BEEN MADE IN GOOD FAITH, AND ADDED THAT IT HAD DONE A LOT TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE OF THE MARIANA DISASTER AND THAT MUCH \u201cIS STILL BEING DONE.\u201d  THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT ADDS TO THE MINING GIANT\u2019S LEGAL TROUBLES. BRAZILIAN PROSECUTORS HAVE SAID THEY ARE LOOKING INTO WHETHER SENIOR VALE EXECUTIVES WERE AWARE OF STABILITY ISSUES AT BRUMADINHO AND OTHER DAMS BUT FAILED TO DISCLOSE THEM OR TAKE ADEQUATE ACTIONS TO RESOLVE THEM.  BRAZILIAN MARKET REGULATOR CVM HAS ALSO OPENED AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIVE PROBES INTO VALE\u2019S HANDLING OF THE DISASTER, WHILE THE COMPANY FACES U.S. CLASS ACTIONS AND AT LEAST ONE INVESTOR ARBITRATION CASE IN BRAZIL.  MINING WATCHDOG ANM IS CARRYING OUT A SEPARATE INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES OF THE DAM BURST AS WELL AS WHETHER ANY MINING OR OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE RULES WERE BROKEN.  \u201cIN MY VIEW, IT\u2019S CLEAR THAT THE CEO OF ANY COMPANY, PUBLIC OR PRIVATE, WILL CERTAINLY BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY SHAREHOLDERS AND THE AUTHORITIES FOR ANY KIND OF STATEMENT, ESPECIALLY IF IT IS PROVEN TO BE UNTRUE,\u201d SAID LUIGI BONIZZATO, A PROFESSOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AT THE FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF RIO DE JANEIRO.  FOR A MULTIMEDIA VERSION OF THIS STORY, CLICK TMSNRT.RS/31NOCT7  DIFFERENT DAMS  VALE OPERATES SEVERAL DIFFERENT KINDS OF DAMS IN BRAZIL TO STORE THE MUDDY DETRITUS OF ITS MINING ACTIVITY KNOWN AS \"TAILINGS.\" THE TWO THAT COLLAPSED USED AN UPSTREAM TECHNIQUE IN WHICH THE DAM IS GRADUALLY BUILT UPON A RESERVOIR OF SLUDGE. FOR A GRAPHIC, CLICK TMSNRT.RS/31RIPR3  SUCH DAMS ARE GENERALLY CHEAPER TO BUILD, BUT THEY RUN A HIGHER RISK OF WATER SEEPING UNDER THE DAM AND WEAKENING THE STRUCTURE, MINING EXPERTS TOLD REUTERS.  CHILE AND PERU HAVE LONG BANNED THE CONSTRUCTION OF SUCH DAMS, BECAUSE OF THE RISKS OF COLLAPSE. IN FEBRUARY, BRAZIL\u2019S ANM BANNED NEW UPSTREAM TAILINGS DAMS AND TOLD MINERS THEY HAD TO DECOMMISSION EXISTING ONES BY AUG. 15, 2023, A DEADLINE IT RECENTLY PUSHED BACK BY AS MANY AS FOUR YEARS.  VALE, THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST IRON ORE EXPORTER, IS NOT THE ONLY BIG MINER THAT OPERATES UPSTREAM DAMS. AT BHP, FOR EXAMPLE, 43% OF ITS 67 OPERATED DAMS ARE UPSTREAM, ALTHOUGH ONLY FIVE OF THOSE ARE ACTIVE, ACCORDING TO A SLIDE PRESENTATION ON ITS WEBSITE FROM JUNE, WITH THE SOLE ACTIVE ONES AMONG THOSE BASED IN CHILE AND AUSTRALIA. BHP VERIFIED THAT THE NUMBERS WERE ACCURATE.  SCHVARTSMAN WAS REMOVED FROM THE CEO JOB IN EARLY MARCH AT THE URGING OF PROSECUTORS WHO SAID IN A LETTER TO THE BOARD THAT HIS AND OTHER TOP VALE EXECUTIVES\u2019 CONTINUED PRESENCE AT THE COMPANY POSED \u201cIMMEASURABLE RISKS TO SOCIETY.\u201d  IN MAY, THE COMPANY TOLD INVESTORS THAT IT EXPECTED TO SPEND $1.855 BILLION TO SHUTTER THE 10 UPSTREAM DAMS IT PLANNED TO CLOSE.  FOR NOW, THE COMPANY\u2019S DAMS CONTINUE TO POSE RISKS.

ANKARA\u2019S MOST AGGRESSIVE MOVE YET TO CURE A HANGOVER FROM TURKEY\u2019S 2018 CURRENCY CRISIS HAS LEFT BANKS SCRAMBLING TO MEET A YEAR-END DEADLINE TO RESTRUCTURE LOANS OR READY THEM FOR SALE.  TURKEY'S BANK WATCHDOG HAD BEEN CALLING BANK EXECUTIVES IN RECENT WEEKS, AFTER THREE MONTHS OF TALKS FAILED TO DELIVER ACTION, TO TELL THEM WHAT PORTION OF LOANS THEY SHOULD RECLASSIFY AS NON-PERFORMING TMSNRT.RS/2OA8LLL AND TO MAKE PROVISIONS, TWO SOURCES SAID.  ON TUESDAY, A YEAR ON FROM THE DARKEST MOMENTS OF THE CURRENCY CRISIS, THE BDDK WATCHDOG WENT PUBLIC WITH ITS REQUIREMENT FOR BANKS TO WRITE OFF LOANS TOTALLING 46 BILLION LIRA ($8.1 BILLION) AS NON-PERFORMING LOANS (NPLS).  THE MOVE WAS DRIVEN BY THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S DESIRE FOR BANKS, ESPECIALLY MORE CAUTIOUS PRIVATE ONES, TO EXTEND MORE CREDIT AND HELP MEET PRESIDENT TAYYIP ERDOGAN\u2019S GOAL OF 5% ECONOMIC GROWTH NEXT YEAR, FIVE SOURCES SAID.  \u201cTHE GOVERNMENT HAS LOST PATIENCE AND WANTS ACTION. WE KNEW THAT NOTHING WAS HAPPENING IN AUGUST, SO IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF WHO WAS GOING TO LOSE PATIENCE FIRST,\u201d ONE OF THE SOURCES, A SENIOR BANKER INVOLVED IN TALKS WITH THE BDDK AND GOVERNMENT, TOLD REUTERS.  THE BANKS HAD HOPED TURKEY\u2019S TREASURY MINISTRY WOULD DO MORE TO SHIELD THEM FROM LOSSES, TELLING THE BDDK AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THAT FISCAL POLICIES HAD IN PART LED TO THE DOWNTURN, A SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AND THE SENIOR BANKER SAID.  THE BDDK REFERRED REUTERS TO ITS STATEMENT ON TUESDAY, WHILE THE TREASURY DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE BDDK MOVE.  AMONG THE BIG PRIVATE BANKS LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY THE CHANGE, ANALYSTS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED YAPI KREDI AND GARANTI BBVA, WHOSE SHARES BOTH SLIPPED THIS WEEK.  NEITHER BANK WAS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE TO COMMENT ON NPLS.  THE 2018 CRISIS SLICED 30% OFF THE VALUE OF THE TURKISH LIRA, ENDED YEARS OF A CONSTRUCTION-DRIVEN BOOM FUELLED BY CHEAP FOREIGN CREDIT, AND SENT INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES SOARING.  TURKEY\u2019S $766 BILLION ECONOMY SLIPPED INTO A RECESSION THAT HAS STRETCHED INTO 2019, LEAVING BANKS WITH SOME $20 BILLION OF DEBT THAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENERGY FIRMS CAN NO LONGER SERVICE.  DURING WEEKS OF CALLS WITH THE REGULATOR, THE BANKS SOUGHT BROADER \u201cSTRUCTURAL CHANGES\u201d AND PROPOSED MERGING OR CANCELLING PROJECTS UNDERPINNING SOME OF THE LOANS, THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID.  THE SENIOR BANKER SAID LENDERS WARNED AGAINST FORCING THEM TO RECOGNISE LOSSES ON SUCH LARGE EXPOSURES BEFORE YEAR-END, PREFERRING INSTEAD TO SPREAD THEM OVER SEVERAL YEARS.  BUT THE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT CONVINCED.  \u201cTHE FOCUS FOR BOTH THE BDDK AND THE TREASURY IS FOR BANKS TO HAVE A TRANSPARENT, PLAIN BALANCE SHEET SO THEY CAN START LENDING AGAIN,\u201d A DEBT RESTRUCTURING CONSULTANT INVOLVED IN THE PRIVATE TALKS TOLD REUTERS ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY.  OUT OF TIME  ANKARA WAS IRRITATED THAT EFFORTS LED MOSTLY BY BANKS TO AGREE A FUND-OF-FUNDS TO MOP UP THE BAD DEBT HAD STALLED OVER THE SPRING AND SUMMER, REUTERS REPORTED IN JULY.  AND IT WAS NOT ENOUGH THAT THE BIGGEST BANKS HAD IN RECENT WEEKS ZEROED IN ON A NEW PLAN FOR AN ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY TO TAKE ON HIGHER-QUALITY NPLS, TWO SOURCES SAID.  SUCH A PLAN WOULD TAKE TIME AND THE BDDK WAS NOT ABOUT TO HOLD OFF ON ITS NPL ANNOUNCEMENT, THEY SAID.  IN GROUP AND BILATERAL TALKS BETWEEN THE BDDK AND BANKS THAT BEGAN IN JUNE, IT ASKED THEM \u201cONE LAST TIME\u201d TO RESTRUCTURE OR CONVERT THE MOSTLY STAGE 2 LOANS TO NPLS, THE SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID.  A STAGE 2 LOAN IS ONE WHERE THE RISK OF NONPAYMENT HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY.  \u201cBUT THE EXPECTED ACTION DID NOT MATERIALIZE, THUS THE (TUESDAY) STATEMENT,\u201d THE OFFICIAL ADDED. \u201cBANKS ARE BEING ASKED TO EXTEND MORE LOANS... AND OF COURSE TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE IN RESTRUCTURING OF PROBLEM LOANS.\u201d  THE TREASURY \u201cTHINKS IT IS THE BANKS\u2019 LACK OF APPETITE FOR LOANS THAT IS HOLDING BACK THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY,\u201d SAID A DEBT RESTRUCTURING CONSULTANT INVOLVED IN THE TALKS.  TURKEY\u2019S CENTRAL BANK, UNDER PRESSURE FROM ERDOGAN TO DO ITS BIT TO BOOST RECOVERY, HAS CUT INTEREST RATES BY 750 BASIS POINTS IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS AND MOVED TO RELIEVE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ON BANKS THAT RAMP UP LENDING.  \u201cTHE GOVERNMENT IS TAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS TO SUPPORT GROWTH, (AND) NEW STEPS AND ADJUSTMENTS WILL COME, BUT PRIVATE BANKS MUST REALLY GIVE STRONGER SUPPORT,\u201d A SECOND GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID.  CREDIT CONUNDRUM  ANALYSTS HAVE FLAGGED THE RISKS OF FORCING CREDIT EXPANSION ON AN ECONOMY THAT WAS STILL CONTRACTING YEAR-ON-YEAR IN THE SECOND QUARTER, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE FEW IF ANY STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO RELY LESS ON FOREIGN FUNDING.  \u201cTHE MOVE HIGHLIGHTS, ONCE AGAIN, THAT CREDIT GROWTH RATHER THAN A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF STRUCTURAL REFORMS REMAINS THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PREFERRED APPROACH TO SUPPORT TURKEY\u2019S AILING ECONOMY,\u201d SAID WOLFANGO PICCOLI, CO-PRESIDENT OF TENEO, A RISK CONSULTANCY.  THE FIRST GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID ONE MOTIVATION FOR THE BDDK MOVE WAS THAT INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND OFFICIALS VISITED TURKEY THIS MONTH TO PREPARE AN ANNUAL REPORT, WHICH WILL NOW INCLUDE THE 46 BILLION-LIRA FIGURE. LAST YEAR, THE IMF REQUESTED MORE PRECISE DATA ON NPLS, THE OFFICIAL SAID.  OTHERS PRAISED THE BDDK FOR SHINING A LIGHT ON THE SIZE OF TURKEY\u2019S BAD DEBT PROBLEM, AND ESTIMATED IT WOULD TRIM BANKS\u2019 EARNINGS BY ABOUT 20% THIS YEAR. THE BDDK SAID BANKS\u2019 NPL RATIO WOULD RISE TO 6.3% BY YEAR END, FROM 4.6%.  AND WHILE TURKISH BANKS HAVE RESISTED OVERTURES ALL YEAR FROM POTENTIAL NPL BUYERS, THAT MAY CHANGE. \u201cBANKS CAN NOW AT LEAST SAY HOW MANY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR THEY ARE WILLING TO SELL FOR,\u201d SAID A SECOND SENIOR BANKER.  BUT THE CONSULTANT SAID BANKS WERE MORE LIKELY TO ACCELERATE RESTRUCTURING SO THEY \u201cCAN GET AWAY WITH SETTING ASIDE LESS PROVISIONS FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES.\u201d  WHILE AN INDEX OF TURKISH BANKS HAS FALLEN 2.3% SINCE THE BDDK\u2019S ANNOUNCEMENT, STATE BANKS, WHICH SHOULDERED A BUMP IN LENDING IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, MAY SEE SOME BENEFITS.  IN EFFECT, THE BDDK\u2019S MOVE MAY PROVIDE COVER FOR THE STATE BANKS TO RAISE NPL RATIOS THAT ARE LOWER THAN THEIR PRIVATE PEERS, WHICH COULD GIVE THEM BETTER ACCESS TO INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKETS. \u201cTHIS WAS THE DECISION STATE BANKS WERE WAITING FOR,\u201d A THIRD SENIOR BANKER SAID.  THE NPL RATIOS OF BIG PRIVATE BANKS, SUCH AS YAPI KREDI AT 5.9% AT MID-YEAR, ARE MARKEDLY HIGHER THAN THOSE OF STATE BANKS, SUCH AS ZIRAAT BANK AT 2.1%.

CONTRADICTORY VERSIONS OF THE CONFRONTATION HAVE EMERGED.  KHAN FILED A CRIMINAL COMPLAINT ALLEGING THREATS AND COERCION AFTER THE CONFRONTATION ON SEPT. 17, DURING WHICH SWISS MEDIA REPORTED THAT INVESTIGO AGENCY DETECTIVES SOUGHT TO TAKE KHAN\u2019S MOBILE PHONE AFTER HE TRIED TO TAKE A PHOTO OF THEIR CAR.  BUT AN INVESTIGO MEMO SEEN BY REUTERS SAID A SINGLE DETECTIVE HAD TAKEN ONLY DEFENSIVE ACTION WHEN KHAN TRIED TO PHOTOGRAPH HIM WITH HIS MOBILE PHONE.  AN INVESTIGO REPRESENTATIVE HAS SAID HE COULD NOT COMMENT ON THE MEMO OR ANY DETAILS OF THE INCIDENT, BUT IT WAS VERY UNLIKELY THAT ONE OF THE FIRM\u2019S DETECTIVES WOULD TRY TO PULL THE PHONE FROM THE HANDS OF SOMEONE BEING TAILED.  THREE EMPLOYEES OF THE SECURITY FIRM WERE BRIEFLY DETAINED BY AUTHORITIES OVER THE INCIDENT, INVESTIGO\u2019S REPRESENTATIVE HAS SAID.

UNLIKE PLENTY OF THEIR P.R.-HUNGRY COUNTERPARTS IN SILICON VALLEY, MEXICAN STARTUP FOUNDERS OFTEN DECLINE MEDIA INTERVIEWS, AVOID PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS AND SUPPRESS DETAILS OF FINANCIAL SUCCESS.  ONE BIG REASON: THEY DO NOT WANT TO ATTRACT CRIMINALS.  \u201cYOU ARE GETTING YOURSELF IN A POSITION WHERE YOU COULD BE SUBJECT TO RANSOM,\u201d ENTREPRENEUR ULISES VAZQUEZ SAID OF THE DRUG-FUELED VIOLENCE AND KIDNAPPINGS THAT HAVE SCARRED SOCIETY.  \u201cYOU WANT TO HAVE A LOW PROFILE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE WITH YOUR FREEDOM,\u201d HE ADDED. VAZQUEZ TWICE KEPT QUIET ON MAJOR STARTUP MILESTONES: WHEN HE SOLD A STAKE IN HIS ADVERTISING AGENCY ERGOS IN 2010, AND WHEN THE ACQUIRING FIRM, MATOMY , WENT PUBLIC IN 2014.  THOUGH UNDERSTANDABLE, THE LOW-PROFILE APPROACH IS HOLDING BACK MEXICO\u2019S TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY, INVESTORS AND EXPERTS SAY, MAKING IT HARDER TO ATTRACT TALENT AND MONEY, ESPECIALLY FROM ABROAD.  MEXICO\u2019S TECH SECTOR LAST YEAR DREW ONLY $175 MILLION IN VENTURE CAPITAL, ACCORDING TO THE ASSOCIATION FOR PRIVATE CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN LATIN AMERICA. THAT WAS DWARFED BY BRAZIL, THE REGION\u2019S POWERHOUSE, WHICH RECEIVED $1.3 BILLION, BUT ALSO TRAILED COLOMBIA, WHICH DREW $334 MILLION IN VENTURE CAPITAL THOUGH ITS ECONOMY IS WORTH ABOUT A QUARTER OF MEXICO\u2019S.  REUTERS SPOKE WITH TWO DOZEN INVESTORS AND STARTUP FOUNDERS WHO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SECURITY CONCERNS WERE WIDESPREAD IN THE TECH COMMUNITY AND HAD EVEN PUSHED SOME ENTREPRENEURS ABROAD.  ILLUSTRATING THE CONCERN, MOST DECLINED TO SPEAK ON THE RECORD.  WITHOUT PUBLICITY, ENTREPRENEURS STRUGGLE TO RECRUIT THE BEST, BRING IN MONEY AND INSPIRE THE NEXT GENERATION, SAID DANIEL GREEN, A PARTNER AT SILICON VALLEY LAW FIRM GUNDERSON DETTMER WHO ADVISES STARTUPS ACROSS LATIN AMERICA.  \u201cIT CERTAINLY STUNTS THE GROWTH,\u201d HE SAID.  \u201cLIVING AT RISK\u201d  TO BE SURE, VIOLENCE IS RAMPANT ELSEWHERE IN LATIN AMERICA, FROM DRUG-TORN COLOMBIA TO CRIME-RIDDEN BRAZIL.  BUT THE ISSUE IS ESPECIALLY ACUTE IN MEXICO DUE TO AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE FROM OVER A DECADE AGO WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SENT ARMED FORCES INTO THE STREETS TO CRACK DOWN ON THE CARTELS. AROUND THE SAME TIME, DRUG GANGS BEGAN BRANCHING INTO EXTORTION.  A STRING OF HIGH-PROFILE KIDNAPPINGS AND MURDERS, INCLUDING THE DEATH OF AN EXECUTIVE AT BROADCASTER TELEVISA KILLED ON HIS BIKE DURING A SHOOTOUT IN 2017, RATTLED THE ELITE.  THAT HAS GENERATED BUSINESS FOR EXECUTIVE PROTECTION FIRMS, WHO PROVIDE BULLET-PROOF VEHICLES, GPS TRACKERS, ARMED BODYGUARDS AND REAL-TIME MONITORING.  FOR STARTUPS, THE FEARS MAY BE MORE PERCEPTION THAN REALITY: THERE ARE NO KNOWN CASES OF TECH ENTREPRENEURS BEING ATTACKED AFTER SHARING THEIR COMPANY\u2019S SUCCESS.  AND SOME DO STILL ANNOUNCE THEIR DEALS.  BISMARCK LEPE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF SOFTWARE COMPANY WIZELINE, BELIEVES HIS PEERS ARE BEING OVER-CAUTIOUS, DESPITE THE HORRORS MEXICO HAS SUFFERED.  \u201cCOMMUNICATING MORE ABOUT YOUR SUCCESS HELPS THE COMMUNITY, HELPS THE COMPANY, HELPS THE INVESTORS,\u201d SAID LEPE, WHO DIVIDES HIS TIME BETWEEN SILICON VALLEY AND MEXICO.  \u201cAS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE DRUG TRADE, NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU.\u201d  MEXICAN ENTREPRENEUR DOMINGO GUERRA, WHO FOUNDED CYBERSECURITY STARTUP APPTHORITY IN CALIFORNIA, SAID HE IS NOT GENERALLY WORRIED ABOUT SAFETY WHEN HE RETURNS HOME. BUT HE DID FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AFTER ANNOUNCING A FUNDING ROUND.  \u201cFOLKS WERE ASKING HOW I WAS GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY, WHAT I WAS GOING TO BUY FIRST,\u201d SAID GUERRA, NOW A SENIOR DIRECTOR AT CYBERSECURITY GIANT SYMANTEC AFTER THE ACQUISITION OF HIS COMPANY IN 2018. \u201cI SPENT A LOT OF TIME EXPLAINING THAT REALLY NONE OF THAT MONEY WAS FOR THE FOUNDERS.\u201d  ONE STARTUP FOUNDER, ASSIGNED A U.S. ARMY VETERAN TRAINED IN ANTI-KIDNAPPING MANEUVERS BY A FIRM ACQUIRING HIS COMPANY, BECAME FED UP OF HAVING TO TAKE A DIFFERENT ROUTE HOME EVERY DAY AND EVENTUALLY RELOCATED WITH HIS FAMILY TO THE UNITED STATES.  ANOTHER WHO FOUNDED HIS STARTUP IN THE SAN FRANCISCO AREA SAID AMERICAN COLLEAGUES WERE FRUSTRATED BY HIS QUIET APPROACH DUE TO FEARS FOR HIS RELATIVES BACK IN MEXICO.  \u201cTHERE\u2019S AN UNOFFICIAL TAX FOR OPERATING AND LIVING IN MEXICO - AND THAT TAX IS LIVING AT RISK,\u201d HE SAID.  FROM SCOOTER TO SUV  SOME ENTREPRENEURS HAVE SIMPLY FADED FROM PUBLIC VIEW.  ADOLFO BABATZ, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF MEXICAN PAYMENTS COMPANY CLIP, WAS ONCE A STAPLE OF THE LOCAL BUSINESS PRESS. IN 2018, HE GAVE AT LEAST FIVE PUBLISHED INTERVIEWS AND GRACED THE COVER OF BUSINESS MAGAZINE EXPANSION BESIDE THE HEADLINE: \u201cTHINK BIG.\u201d  HE TOOK A DIFFERENT TACK THIS YEAR AFTER SOFTBANK PUMPED ABOUT $20 MILLION INTO HIS COMPANY, MAKING HIM AMONG THE FIRST MEXICAN ENTREPRENEURS TO WIN THE JAPANESE CONGLOMERATE\u2019S STAMP OF APPROVAL. BABATZ DID NOT ANNOUNCE THE DEAL AND APPEARS TO HAVE GIVEN FEW INTERVIEWS SO FAR IN 2019.  SOFTBANK, WHICH PLANS TO POUR $5 BILLION INTO LATIN AMERICA, DECLINED TO COMMENT.  SOME ENTREPRENEURS ADVOCATE WORKAROUNDS.  GABRIEL LEON, WHO RECENTLY LAUNCHED FINTECH COMPANY OYSTER FINANCIAL IN MEXICO, PLANS TO DISCLOSE COMPANY FUNDING ROUNDS ON AN ONLINE DATABASE, RATHER THAN VIA THE MEDIA.  \u201cWE NEVER TALK ABOUT MONEY,\u201d HE SAID. \u201cWE TALK ABOUT THE PRODUCT WE\u2019RE BUILDING, THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE MARKET, OUR COMPETITORS. THAT\u2019S HOW YOU GET ATTENTION FROM INVESTORS.\u201d  SOME ENTREPRENEURS SAY THE POLITICAL CLIMATE, WITH LEFTIST PRESIDENT ANDRES MANUEL LOPEZ OBRADOR FREQUENTLY CRUSADING AGAINST THE ELITES, HAS MADE IT AN ADDITIONALLY AWKWARD TIME TO TOUT MULTI-MILLION DEALS IN A CULTURE THAT FROWNS ON BRAGGING.  MEXICO\u2019S ECONOMY MINISTRY DID NOT RESPOND TO REUTERS REQUESTS TO DISCUSS THE STARTUP SECTOR\u2019S SECURITY CONCERNS.  SERGIO ROMO, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF MEXICAN SCOOTER STARTUP GRIN, FOLLOWED A SIMILAR TRAJECTORY TO BABATZ AFTER A $45.7 MILLION FUNDING ROUND LAST YEAR.  EARLIER THIS YEAR, ROMO, WHO WAS KNOWN FOR TOOLING AROUND THE CAPITAL IN HIS COMPANY\u2019S NEON GREEN SCOOTERS, LEFT A MEETING WITH MEXICO CITY REGULATORS IN A LARGE SUV WITH TINTED WINDOWS, ACCORDING TO SOMEONE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE MEETING.  ROMO TOLD REUTERS THAT WAS UNUSUAL AND HE STILL USES SCOOTERS, BUT ACKNOWLEDGED KEEPING A LOW PROFILE WAS ADVISABLE.  \u201cPEOPLE OUTSIDE THE STARTUP WORLD TEND TO THINK THAT FOUNDERS WHO RAISE A LOT OF MONEY BECOME RICH THEMSELVES, BUT SOMETIMES THAT\u2019S NOT THE CASE,\u201d HE SAID.  \u201cWE ARE JUST FOUNDERS TRYING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.\u201d  ONCE ACTIVE ON TWITTER, HIS POSTS HAVE BEEN DELETED.", "Ticker": "NSIT", "Date": "2019-10-16T00:00:00", "key": "20191016NSIT", "labelr0": 1.5881418740074087, "labelr1": 0.7121764808059694, "labelr2": 0.7416350465677816, "labelr3": 0.2910460537579211, "labelr4": -0.768180266302485, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.314, "compound": -0.4939, "0_day_return": 1.5881418740073985, "1_day_return": 1.5881418740073985, "2_day_return": 1.459093277748824, "3_day_return": 1.754385964912264, "4_day_return": 0.9727288518325494, "label": 1, "return": 0.0027628316524479237, "excess_return": 1.5853790423549503, "count_of_word": 1065, "pred": -1, "prof-1": 0.42982563, "prof1": 0.57017446, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5998460468162881, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4001539531837121, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.42982563, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.57017446, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.39928806, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.60071194, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5124727, "tr_prof1": 0.48752725, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.433254, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.56674606, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5745474, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.42545256, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.5370047, "headline_prof21": 0.4629953, "textplusheadline_pred": -1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.54584885, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.4541512, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.7651541999999999, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.23484579, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.8040719, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.19592808, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -1.5881418740073985, "returnpredvader": -1.5881418740073985, "returnpredsgd": -1.5881418740073985, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.004032453398388, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.000074266886711, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9990174229774901, "cumreturn1b": 2.425349793653344, "cumreturn1d": 1.248799524511642, "cumreturn1e": 1.2211476711140303, "cumreturndow": 1.1943880815618717, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1576117005615842}, {"Unnamed: 0": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13205, "level_0": 13205, "index": 13205, "text": "SAO PAULO, OCT 16 (REUTERS) - BRAZILIAN STATE-RUN POWER FIRM CENTRAIS ELETRICAS BRASILEIRAS SA ESTIMATED THAT IT COULD RAISE UP TO 5.1 BILLION REAIS ($1.23 BILLION) VIA THE POTENTIAL ISSUE OF 9.99 BILLION REAIS WORTH OF SHARES, ACCORDING TO A COMPANY PRESENTATION RELEASED WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

FILE PHOTO: A VIEW OF BRAZILIAN MINING COMPANY VALE'S COLLAPSED TAILINGS DAM IN BRUMADINHO, BRAZIL, FEB. 13, 2019. REUTERS/WASHINGTON ALVES  THE REPORT, RELEASED BY VALE ON THURSDAY, SAID THERE WAS NO WARNING THE DAM WAS UNSTABLE, AND NO SEISMIC ACTIVITY OR EXPLOSIONS IN THE AREA WERE RECORDED BEFORE IT BURST IN LATE JANUARY.  THE DAM COLLAPSE UNLEASHED AN AVALANCHE OF MINING WASTE ON THE BRAZILIAN TOWN OF BRUMADINHO, KILLING AT LEAST 155 PEOPLE.  THE REPORT EXAMINED TECHNICAL FACTORS LEADING TO THE DISASTER RATHER THAN ISSUES OF LIABILITY. IT CAME LESS THAN FOUR YEARS AFTER ANOTHER DAM COLLAPSE AT A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN VALE AND BHP GROUP IN THE SAME REGION, AN ACCIDENT THAT EXPERTS ALSO BLAMED ON WATER WEAKENING THE SOLID MATERIALS COMPOSING THE DAM SO THAT THEY BEHAVE MORE LIKE A LIQUID - A PHENOMENON KNOWN AS LIQUEFACTION.  MASSIVE SO-CALLED TAILING DAMS PROVIDE THE MOST COMMON WASTE DISPOSAL FOR MINING COMPANIES, WHETHER EXTRACTING IRON ORE, GOLD OR COPPER. WHILE PRIOR EXPERIENCE INDICATES THE DAMS RARELY COLLAPSE BECAUSE OF A SINGLE CAUSE, THE BRUMADINHO DISASTER WAS SET IN MOTION BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING POOR INTERNAL DRAINAGE AND INTENSE RAIN THAT HELPED CAUSE THE EXCESS WATER, THE FOUR-EXPERT PANEL SAID.  VALE AND ITS TOP EXECUTIVES AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER HAVE BEEN ASSAILED BY POLITICIANS AND PROSECUTORS FOR FAILING TO PREVENT THE DISASTER, DESPITE WHAT CRITICS SAY WERE AMPLE WARNING SIGNS. BUT THE PANEL\u2019S REPORT SAID THERE WERE \u201cNO APPARENT SIGNS OF DISTRESS PRIOR TO FAILURE.\u201d  THE DISASTER HAS WEIGHED HEAVILY ON VALE\u2019S SHARE PRICE, WHICH IS STILL AROUND 5% LOWER THAN THE DAY BEFORE THE JAN. 25 DISASTER, WHILE THE BROADER BOVESPA INDEX HAS RISEN 18% TO AN ALL-TIME HIGH. ON THURSDAY, THE SHARES TICKED 1.4% HIGHER.  THE PANEL\u2019S CHAIRMAN PETER ROBERTSON SIDESTEPPED QUESTIONS AT A SAO PAULO NEWS CONFERENCE ABOUT WHETHER THE REPORT SHOWED VALE DID ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE DISASTER AND WAS AWARE OF THE RISK, SAYING QUESTIONS OF LIABILITY WERE BEING EXAMINED BY A SEPARATE PANEL.  THE OTHER COMMITTEE IS STILL INVESTIGATING AND THERE IS NO TIMELINE FOR WHEN IT WILL FINALIZE ITS RESULTS, A VALE SPOKESWOMAN SAID.  SUSPICION THAT LIQUEFACTION CAUSED THE BRUMADINHO COLLAPSE WAS RAISED BY AN OFFICIAL IN BRAZIL\u2019S MINAS GERAIS STATE AS EARLY AS FEBRUARY.  ROBERTSON, A GEOTECHNICAL CONSULTANT AND FORMER PROFESSOR, SAID IT WAS CLEAR VALE AND THE CONSULTANTS IT HIRED TO INSPECT THE BRUMADINHO DAM WERE AWARE OF THE ISSUES WITH EXCESS WATER.  \u201cIT\u2019S FAIR TO SAY THEY WERE AWARE OF THE HIGH WATER LEVEL AND THEY WERE TAKING ACTIONS TO LOWER IT AND THE WATER LEVELS WERE SLOWLY GOING DOWN,\u201d HE SAID.  VALE WAS LESS AWARE OF ANOTHER ISSUE RELATED TO HIGH IRON CONTENT IN THE MINING WASTE USED TO BUILD THE DAM\u2019S SUCCESSIVE LEVELS, WHICH PROMOTED \u201cBONDING\u201d THAT MADE ITS CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS \u201cPOTENTIALLY VERY BRITTLE,\u201d ROBERTSON SAID.

APELLIS PHARMACEUTICALS INC SAID ON TUESDAY ITS EXPERIMENTAL DRUG FOR A BLOOD DISORDER SHOWED GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN PATIENTS\u2019 HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS THAN ALEXION PHARMACEUTICALS INC\u2019S SOLIRIS, IN A LATE-STAGE STUDY.  THE STUDY TESTED APELLIS\u2019 PEGCETACOPLAN IN 80 PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL HEMOGLOBINURIA (PNH) PATIENTS WHO REMAINED ANEMIC DESPITE TAKING SOLIRIS. ABOUT HALF OF THEM WERE EVEN DEPENDANT ON BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS TO MAINTAIN OPTIMAL HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS.  THE TRIAL RESULTS WOULD HELP APELLIS CHALLENGE ALEXION\u2019S DOMINANCE IN THE PNH MARKET. ALEXION\u2019S SOLIRIS AND ULTOMIRIS, THE ONLY TWO CURRENTLY APPROVED DRUGS FOR PNH, RECORDED SALES OF $1.08 BILLION IN THE LATEST SEPTEMBER QUARTER.  PNH IS A RARE, LIFE-THREATENING DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH ABNORMALLY LOW HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS DUE TO THE DESTRUCTION OF OXYGEN-CARRYING RED BLOOD CELLS, MAKING PATIENTS DEPENDANT ON FREQUENT BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS.  ABOUT 70% OF PNH PATIENTS SHOW LOW HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS DESPITE TREATMENT WITH SOLIRIS AND 36% REQUIRE ONE OR MORE TRANSFUSIONS A YEAR, ACCORDING TO APELLIS. WITH PEGCETACOPLAN, ALSO CALLED APL-2, APELLIS EXPECTS TO ADDRESS THIS UNMET NEED.

LME VOLUMES BY CONTRACT: TMSNRT.RS/2UTKQU5    SHFE VOLUMES BY CONTRACT: TMSNRT.RS/2QVY54Q  BY ANDY HOME  LONDON, JAN 10 (REUTERS) - BASE METALS TRADING VOLUMES SHRANK ON ALL THREE MAJOR GLOBAL EXCHANGES LAST YEAR AS TRADE WAR UNCERTAINTY AND RANGE-BOUND MARKETS DAMPENED SPECULATIVE ACTIVITY.  \u2018DOCTOR COPPER\u2019 HAS LONG BEEN A FAVOURITE METALLIC PLAY AMONG PUNTERS AND SLIDING VOLUMES WERE SYMPTOMATIC OF A SECTOR THAT WAS LARGELY OUT OF FAVOUR WITH THE MONEY MEN.  THE LONDON METAL EXCHANGE\u2019S (LME) COPPER CONTRACT SAW ACTIVITY FALL BY 8% LAST YEAR. THE DECLINES WERE MORE PRONOUNCED ON BOTH THE CME AND SHANGHAI FUTURES EXCHANGES (SHFE) CONTRACTS WITH VOLUMES SLUMPING BY 25% AND 29% RESPECTIVELY.  ONLY NICKEL BUCKED THE BROADER TREND THANKS TO HEIGHTENED PRICE VOLATILITY AND THE METAL\u2019S ELECTRIC VEHICLE CREDENTIALS. TRADING VOLUMES ROSE BY 3% IN LONDON AND BY 40% IN SHANGHAI, WHERE NICKEL HAS ALSO ASSUMED THE ROLE OF JUNIOR PARTNER IN A PROXY TRADE WITH THE MUCH LARGER IRON ORE MARKET.  EXCHANGES CAN\u2019T DO MUCH ABOUT MANUFACTURING SLOWDOWN OR THE RESULTING RANGE-BOUND PRICING BUT THEY ARE EXPANDING THEIR PRODUCT RANGE AND OPENING UP ENTIRELY NEW MARKETS.  BASE METALS DOWNTURN  IT WAS A YEAR TO FORGET FOR MANY OF THE BASE METALS WITH COPPER, ALUMINIUM, ZINC AND LEAD CLOSING OUT 2019 LITTLE CHANGED FROM YEAR-START LEVELS.  TOTAL VOLUMES ON THE LONDON MARKET, WHICH STILL DOMINATES PHYSICAL PRICING, FELL BY 4.6% LAST YEAR AFTER A SIMILAR-SIZED RISE IN 2018.  IN TRUTH THE LME FARED SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN SUGGESTED BY THE HEADLINE FIGURE, WHICH INCLUDES SO-CALLED \u201cUNA\u201d TRADES INTRODUCED TO COMPLY WITH EUROPEAN MIFIDII REGULATIONS. STRIP THOSE OUT AND THE YEAR-ON-YEAR DECLINE WAS ONLY 1.9%.  EVEN SO, ACTIVITY ON ALL THE LME\u2019S CORE CONTRACTS FELL LAST YEAR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NICKEL, THE TOP PRICE PERFORMER AMONG THE BASE METALS IN 2019, AND TIN, THE WEAKEST PRICE PERFORMER. THE SAME TWO METALS WERE THE ONLY TWO TO REGISTER HIGHER VOLUMES IN SHANGHAI.  TIN REMAINS A TINY FUTURES MARKET BY COMPARISON WITH NICKEL BUT EVEN IT DWARFS THE LME\u2019S ALUMINIUM ALLOY CONTRACT, WHICH WITH VOLUME GROWTH OF 7% WAS THE UNLIKELY STAR PERFORMER LAST YEAR.  THAT OUTPERFORMANCE, HOWEVER, SHOULD BE SEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF FALLING ACTIVITY IN EACH OF THE PREVIOUS FOUR YEARS.  NEW PRODUCTS  THE LME LAUNCHED TWO NEW ALUMINIUM PREMIUM CONTRACTS IN MARCH LAST YEAR BUT WITH ONLY LIMITED SUCCESS. THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTRACT TRADED JUST 939 LOTS WHILE THE EUROPEAN PRODUCT FAILED TO TRADE AT ALL.  CME, WHICH LAUNCHED THE FIRST OF ITS FOUR ALUMINIUM PREMIUM CONTRACTS AS FAR BACK AS 2013, APPEARS TO HAVE CAPTURED THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE MARKET WITH TOTAL VOLUMES LAST YEAR OF 152,353 CONTRACTS.  ITS UNDERLYING ALUMINIUM CONTRACT LOOKED IN DANGER OF DISAPPEARING ALTOGETHER WITH NO TRADES AT ALL IN 2018 BUT THE CONTRACT SPRANG INTO LIFE IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2019 AFTER CME EXTENDED PHYSICAL DELIVERY TO ASIAN LOCATIONS SUCH AS SINGAPORE AND THE MALAYSIAN PORTS OF JOHOR AND PORT KLANG. THEY CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR 9,291 TONNES OF CME\u2019S TOTAL 17,145 TONNES OF REGISTERED ALUMINIUM STOCKS.  CME ZINC STOCKS HAVE SHRUNK TO JUST 6 TONNES AND THE CONTRACT, WHICH DIDN\u2019T TRADE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, LOOKS PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO FOLLOWING THE CME LEAD CONTRACT INTO OBLIVION.  VOLUMES IN THE CME\u2019S COPPER OPTIONS CONTRACT DOUBLED YEAR-ON-YEAR AND THE EXCHANGE\u2019S WEEKLY OPTIONS CONTRACTS, LAUNCHED IN 2018, STEADILY GAINED TRACTION OVER THE COURSE OF 2019.  AS DID THE SHFE COPPER OPTIONS CONTRACT, ALSO LAUNCHED IN 2018. ALMOST 8.4 MILLION LOTS TRADED IN 2019 WITH OPEN INTEREST IN DECEMBER STANDING AT 64,526 LOTS, UP 16% ON DECEMBER 2018.  MORE NEW BASE METAL PRODUCTS WERE LAUNCHED LAST YEAR BY HONG KONG EXCHANGES AND CLEARING (HKEX), THE OWNER OF THE LME.  A SUITE OF DOLLAR-DENOMINATED \u201cMINI\u201d CONTRACTS APPEAR TO BE SUCCEEDING WHERE THE YUAN-DENOMINATED OFFERING HAS LARGELY FAILED. TOTAL VOLUME WAS 29,334 CONTRACTS SINCE LAUNCH IN AUGUST, COMPARED WITH JUST 237 OVER THE WHOLE YEAR FOR THE CHINESE CURRENCY PRODUCTS.  THE NEW STEEL FRONTIER  ALL THREE EXCHANGES ARE ALSO MAKING STEADY INROADS INTO THE FERROUS SECTOR, WHICH HAS HISTORICALLY PROVED STUBBORNLY RESISTANT TO FUTURES TRADING.  THE LME\u2019S SCRAP AND REBAR CONTRACTS HAVE TRADED SINCE THE START OF 2018 AND ARE SEEING RESPECTABLE ACTIVITY. TWO NEW CONTRACTS, COVERING HOT ROLLED COIL (HRC) IN CHINA AND NORTH AMERICA, HAVE SEEN VOLUMES BUILD SINCE TRADING STARTED IN MARCH LAST YEAR. THE FORMER SET A NEW MONTHLY VOLUME RECORD OF 16,297 LOTS IN DECEMBER, BRINGING THE 2019 TOTAL TO 45,884 LOTS.  THE EXCHANGE HAS DROPPED PLENTY OF HINTS IT WILL CONSIDER BUILDING OUT ITS FERROUS PORTFOLIO FURTHER, GIVEN THE LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION IN THE CURRENT OFFERINGS.  IT\u2019S NOTICEABLE THAT THE CME\u2019S HRC CONTRACT HAS SEEN INCREASED ACTION SINCE THE LME RE-ENTERED THE STEEL SECTOR AFTER THE FAILURE OF ITS FORMER BILLET CONTRACT. CME VOLUMES GREW BY 89% IN 2018 AND BY ANOTHER 45% LAST YEAR, WHEN THE EQUIVALENT OF ALMOST 3.5 MILLION TONNES TRADED.  SHFE CURRENTLY RUNS THE HIGHEST-VOLUME GLOBAL STEEL CONTRACT. STEEL REBAR VOLUMES DROPPED 12% LAST YEAR BUT STILL TOTAL LED 930 MILLION CONTRACTS. EVEN ALLOWING FOR THE FACT THAT SHFE DOUBLE-COUNTS ITS VOLUMES, A PRACTICE THAT CHANGED AT THE START OF 2020, IT\u2019S STILL A STAGGERING FIGURE.  THE CHINESE EXCHANGE LAST YEAR EXTENDED ITS FERROUS PRODUCT RANGE WITH A NEW STAINLESS CONTRACT, WHICH TRADED 1.2 MILLION LOTS IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS.  QIANHAI SURPRISE  NOT ALL NEW PRODUCTS FLOURISH AND THE LME\u2019S NEW COBALT AND MOLYBDENUM CONTRACTS FAILED TO GET ANY TRACTION LAST YEAR.  THE LACK OF INTEREST IN THE NEW CASH-SETTLED COBALT CONTRACT IS PUZZLING, GIVEN THE STEADY DECLINE IN ACTIVITY IN THE OLDER PHYSICALLY DELIVERABLE CONTRACT, WHICH SAW VOLUMES SLUMP BY 26% LAST YEAR. IT\u2019S NOT AS IF COBALT HASN\u2019T BEEN VOLATILE OR THAT CARMAKERS HAVEN\u2019T EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR A WAY OF HEDGING A KEY INPUT INTO ELECTRIC BATTERIES.  ALSO STRANGE IS THE LACK OF TRACTION GAINED BY EITHER THE CME OR LME ALUMINA CONTRACTS, GIVEN THE SECTOR HAS SWITCHED TOWARDS SPOT PRICING.  CME ALUMINA VOLUMES FELL BY 79% LAST YEAR TO 118,200 TONNES, WHILE THE LME\u2019S NEW ALUMINA CONTRACT NOTCHED UP TRADES OF JUST 46,000 TONNES.  BOTH WERE ECLIPSED BY THE 374,011 TONNES TRADED ON THE QIANHAI MERCANTILE EXCHANGE, HKEX\u2019S FORAY INTO MAINLAND CHINA.  THE QME IS SOMETHING OF AN ANOMALY IN THE GLOBAL METALS EXCHANGE WORLD. BARRED FROM OFFERING FUTURES PRODUCTS IN MAINLAND CHINA, HKEX HAS BEEN BUILDING OUT A PHYSICAL EXCHANGE.  ALUMINA WAS ONE OF FIVE METALLIC OFFERINGS LAUNCHED LAST YEAR. THE OTHERS ARE COPPER CATHODE, COPPER ROD, ALUMINIUM INGOT AND ALUMINIUM BILLET.  IT\u2019S TAKEN SEVERAL YEARS FOR HKEX TO GET THE QME UP AND RUNNING BUT IT IS WORTH WATCHING BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS A CLEAR CHALLENGE TO THE CHINESE INCUMBENT IN SHANGHAI.  THE BIG THREE EXCHANGES CURRENTLY CO-EXIST IN A RELATIVELY PEACEFUL ORDER. WHAT THE CHINESE LIKE TO CALL A \u201cWIN-WIN\u201d SCENARIO MAY NOT LAST LONG IF QME PICKS UP TRADING MOMENTUM.", "Ticker": "CME", "Date": "2020-01-10T00:00:00", "key": "20200110CME", "labelr0": -1.6213364033194202, "labelr1": -0.4632112730996231, "labelr2": -0.2841187420397689, "labelr3": 0.7123206916879488, "labelr4": 1.0438515194380835, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.191, "compound": -0.3818, "0_day_return": -1.6213364033194178, "1_day_return": -1.6213364033194178, "2_day_return": -0.7460139450972902, "3_day_return": -0.03900726510315256, "4_day_return": 1.0044370764054733, "label": -1, "return": 0.0069762152039844535, "excess_return": -1.6283126185234025, "count_of_word": 1151, "pred": -1, "prof-1": 0.73361224, "prof1": 0.26638779999999995, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5029548857287194, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4970451142712806, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.73361224, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.26638779999999995, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.63761914, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.3623808, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5171162, "tr_prof1": 0.48288387, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.43608168, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.5639183000000001, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5931922, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.40680778, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.31144327, "headline_prof21": 0.68855673, "textplusheadline_pred": -1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.55452156, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.44547844, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.4296634, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.57033664, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.5086893, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.49131066, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 1.6213364033194178, "returnpredvader": 1.6213364033194178, "returnpredsgd": 1.6213364033194178, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.021794873069486, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9792097771651261, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9742713978914732, "cumreturn1b": 4.009535331166192, "cumreturn1d": 1.2108059306693921, "cumreturn1e": 1.0691951263615627, "cumreturndow": 1.3099962331167778, "cumreturnsp500": 1.2381886972490583}, {"Unnamed: 0": 16921, "Unnamed: 0.1": 16921, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 16921, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 16921, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 16921, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 16921, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16921, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16921, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16921, "level_0": 16921, "index": 16921, "text": "JAN 14 (REUTERS) - BHP GROUP SAID ON TUESDAY LINDSAY MAXSTED WILL NOT STAND FOR RE-ELECTION AS A DIRECTOR, MONTHS AFTER HE BROUGHT FORWARD HIS RETIREMENT AS CHAIRMAN OF WESTPAC BANKING CORP AFTER A MONEY-LAUNDERING SCANDAL ROCKED THE LENDER.

REUTERS/MIKE BLAKE/FILE PHOTO  KALVARIA ALSO TOLD THE REUTERS GLOBAL MARKETS FORUM ON THURSDAY THAT CITI\u2019S OVERALL MARKET SHARE ACROSS ADVISORY, SYNDICATE LENDING, EQUITY AND DEBT ORIGINATION ROSE IN 2019, BUT ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TALENT IS CHALLENGING IN THE BUSINESS.  BELOW ARE EXCERPTS FROM THE CHAT, HELD ON THE SIDELINES OF THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM\u2019S ANNUAL MEETING IN DAVOS, SWITZERLAND:  QUESTION (Q) - IS GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY KEEPING SOME CORPORATE CLIENTS, WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOOKING FOR DEALS OR OTHER FINANCING, ON THE SIDELINES?  ANSWER (A) - I DON\u2019T THINK GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES ARE AFFECTING CLIENTS WHO ARE LOOKING TO DO STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS. HOWEVER, THAT SAID, OBVIOUSLY OUTBOUND MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS (M&A) FROM CHINA HAS GONE DOWN CONSIDERABLY, BUT OTHER CROSS BORDER M&A REMAINS REASONABLY STRONG.  Q - MANY OF CITIGROUP\u2019S COMPETITORS ARE GOING DOWN MARKET TO LOOK FOR GROWTH SINCE THERE IS MORE COMPETITION FOR THE BIGGEST DEALS BUT FEWER OF THEM. WHY HASN\u2019T CITI FOLLOWED SUIT?  A - WE ARE NOT GOING DOWN MARKET BECAUSE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT\u2019S THE RIGHT PHRASEOLOGY. WHAT WE ARE DOING IS SPENDING SIGNIFICANT TIME ON SMALLER EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE, OVER TIME, WILL BE WINNERS WITHIN THEIR SUB-SECTORS.  THOSE COMPANIES ARE CANDIDATES FOR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGER AND ACQUISITION (M&A) OPPORTUNITIES AND OTHER POTENTIAL SERVICES THAT WE CAN BRING TO BEAR AS THEY GROW GLOBALLY.  Q - HOW HAS THE ERA OF \u201cUNICORNS\u201d CHANGED THE WAY CITIGROUP SOURCES NEW CLIENTS?  A - THE ERA OF UNICORNS RELATES TO THE EARLIER QUESTION ABOUT COVERING SMALLER COMPANIES. THE UNICORN VALUATIONS HELP HIGHLIGHT COMPANIES WITH GREAT POTENTIAL FOR US TO COVER AND ARE VERY HELPFUL IN THE AREAS WE SHOULD INVEST IN FROM THE PEOPLE STANDPOINT.  Q - IN 2018, CITI\u2019S OVERALL MARKET SHARE ACROSS ADVISORY, SYNDICATE LENDING AND EQUITY AND DEBT ORIGINATION ROSE TO 5.1%, FROM 4.9%. HOW IS THE EFFORT TO CAPTURE MORE MARKET SHARE PROGRESSING AND WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST HURDLES?  A - WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE IN 2019 SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY. THE HURDLES REMAIN IN RETAINING AND ATTRACTING THE BEST TALENT. THIS IS A PEOPLE BUSINESS AND WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST.  Q - HOW WILL THE CORPORATE BANKING LANDSCAPE CHANGE, GIVEN RECENT CONSOLIDATION IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS INDUSTRY. WILL FEWER PLAYERS IN EQUITY OR DEBT IMPACT THE OTHER CORPORATE BANKING BUSINESS LINES?  A - CORPORATE BANKING BUSINESS WILL REMAIN A BROAD GLOBAL BUSINESS. OBVIOUSLY THE BIG 3 AMERICAN CORPORATE BANKS CONTINUE TO ENJOY A VERY STRONG POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND REMAIN VERY STRONG. BUT THEY (FACE) COMPETITION FROM LEADING BANKS IN ASIA AND EUROPE.  IN TERMS OF FIXED INCOME AND EQUITIES, SOME PLAYERS HAVE RETREATED TO SOME EXTENT AND THAT HAS GIVEN OTHER PLAYERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PICK UP MARKET SHARE.

REUTERS/ALESSANDRO BIANCHI/FILE PHOTO  SPEAKING ON RADIO 24, DEPUTY TRANSPORT MINISTER GIANCARLO CANCELLERI, FROM THE 5-STAR MOVEMENT THAT HAS LED CALLS FOR ATLANTIA TO BE STRIPPED OF ITS CONCESSION, ACKNOWLEDGED THE GOVERNMENT COULD DECIDE NOT TO REVOKE THE LICENSE.

ATLANTIA HAS BEEN UNDER PRESSURE SINCE AUGUST 2018 WHEN A BRIDGE OPERATED BY ITS MOTORWAY UNIT AUTOSTRADE PER L\u2019ITALIA COLLAPSED IN THE PORT CITY OF GENOA, KILLING 43 PEOPLE.  AUTOSTRADE GENERATES A THIRD OF ATLANTIA\u2019S CORE PROFITS AND LOSING THE CONCESSION WOULD PUT THE GROUP, WHICH HAS BILLIONS OF EUROS IN DEBT, UNDER SEVERE PRESSURE.  THE GOVERNMENT IS DIVIDED ON REVOKING THE CONCESSION, WITH THE CENTER-LEFT DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PD), WHICH GOVERNS WITH 5-STAR, MORE CAUTIOUS ON THE ISSUE, FEARING A LEGAL BATTLE AND POTENTIALLY HEAVY COMPENSATION COSTS FOR THE STATE.  \u201cIF THE GOVERNMENT CHANGES ITS ATTITUDE (ON THE CONCESSION), THE STOCK CAN ONLY GAIN,\u201d A MILAN-TRADER SAID.

REUTERS/RASHID UMAR ABBASI/FILE PHOTO  THE $60 MILLION SETTLEMENT COMES AS A 10-DAY TRIAL IS SCHEDULED TO START ON MARCH 16 IN DELAWARE IN WHICH SHAREHOLDERS SEEK $2.6 BILLION IN DAMAGES, THE ENTIRE COST OF THE SOLARCITY DEAL.  A LAWYER FOR MUSK AND A SPOKESMAN FOR TESLA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT.  TESLA SHAREHOLDERS HAVE ALLEGED MUSK BREACHED HIS FIDUCIARY DUTIES, SQUANDERED TESLA\u2019S ASSETS AND UNJUSTLY ENRICHED HIMSELF BY PUSHING TO BUY THE MONEY-LOSING SOLAR COMPANY IN WHICH HE WAS THE BIGGEST INVESTOR.  THE SETTLEMENT COVERED FIVE CURRENT DIRECTORS: ROBYN DENHOLM, IRA EHRENPREIS, ANTONIO GRACIAS, STEPHEN JURVETSON AND KIMBAL MUSK. BRAD BUSS, WHO WAS A DIRECTOR AT THE TIME OF THE SOLARCITY DEAL, WAS ALSO PART OF THE SETTLEMENT, WHICH WAS PAID FROM INSURANCE POLICIES, ACCORDING TO COURT DOCUMENTS.  \u201cPLAINTIFFS PROBABLY THINK THEY HAVE A CLEANER SHOT ON THE MERITS IF THE ONLY ISSUES THEY HAVE TO RAISE ARE WITH ELON MUSK AND ELON MUSK\u2019S ACTIONS,\u201d SAID BRIAN QUINN, A PROFESSOR AT BOSTON COLLEGE LAW SCHOOL.  THE CASE WAS BROUGHT IN THE COURT OF CHANCERY IN DELAWARE, WHERE TESLA IS INCORPORATED, BY AN INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR AND FIVE INVESTMENT FUNDS.  TESLA SAID IN A STATEMENT TO REUTERS IN SEPTEMBER THE ALLEGATIONS WERE \u201cBASED ON THE CLAIMS OF PLAINTIFF\u2019S LAWYERS LOOKING FOR A PAYDAY, AND ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS.\u201d  THE SUIT REPRESENTS ANOTHER LEGAL HEADACHE FOR MUSK, WHO IN THE PAST TWO YEARS HAS SETTLED A LAWSUIT BY SECURITIES REGULATORS OVER HIS USE OF TWITTER AND WON A DEFAMATION TRIAL BROUGHT BY A BRITISH CAVE EXPLORER.  MUSK AND THE TESLA BOARD ALSO ARE SCHEDULED TO DEFEND MUSK\u2019S PAY PACKAGE AT A TRIAL IN DELAWARE NEXT YEAR.  AT THE HEART OF THE CURRENT CASE ARE ALLEGATIONS THAT MUSK AND THE OTHER BOARD MEMBERS DID NOT FULLY DISCLOSE THE DEPTH OF SOLARCITY\u2019S PROBLEMS, OR THEIR OWN CONFLICTS.  SOLARCITY WAS FOUNDED IN 2006 BY MUSK AND HIS COUSINS, LYNDON RIVE AND PETER RIVE, WHO WERE THE COMPANY\u2019S CEO AND CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER AS WELL AS DIRECTORS. MUSK WAS SOLARCITY\u2019S CHAIRMAN AND LARGEST SHAREHOLDER, AND FIVE OF TESLA\u2019S DIRECTORS WERE DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERS OF SOLARCITY STOCK.  ENTERING 2016, SOLARCITY\u2019S STOCK WAS ON A SHARP DOWNWARD TRAJECTORY AND THE COMPANY WAS SLASHING ITS WORKFORCE AND BLEEDING CASH.  TESLA TOUTED SYNERGIES OF COMBINING THE COMPANIES IN THE ALL-STOCK DEAL, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY TESLA SHAREHOLDERS.  AFTER THE DEAL CLOSED, TESLA SLASHED ITS SOLAR SALES FORCE AND ENDED A SOLAR MARKETING DEAL WITH HOME DEPOT INC. QUARTERLY SOLAR INSTALLATIONS PLUMMETED AND ARE WELL BELOW LEVELS SOLARCITY ENJOYED IN ITS HEYDAY.  TESLA HAS SAID MUSK\u2019S INVOLVEMENT IN DEAL DISCUSSIONS AND ALL OTHER MATERIAL INFORMATION WERE ACCURATELY DESCRIBED TO SHAREHOLDERS IN PUBLIC FILINGS BEFORE THE DEAL CLOSED.
