<p>**Backtest:</p>
<p>We use a long-short equally-weighted portfolio backtest for all our models. Other papers have tended to use the top 10 long predictions and top 10 short predictions to build a portfolio but we prefer to include all predictions in our portfolio. We assume that we are able to buy at market open and liquidate at market close. 
Our backtest does not incorporate:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use of options/derivatives</p>
</li>
<li><p>Self-financing portfolios</p>
</li>
<li><p>Leverage</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optimal sizing of trades: all positions are the same size</p>
</li>
<li><p>Transaction costs</p>
</li>
<li><p>Slippage</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>**Proof-of-Concept 1: Reuters dataset 1 2017-2020</p>
<p>Data is segmented into training data (2017-2018) and test data (2019-2020). Preprocessing of the text data for text normalization, stemming, lemmatization and extraction of stop words.</p>
<p>*Model accuracy on the validation dataset:</p>

<pre><code>NTLK VADER Sentiment Analyzer - N/A

Linear Classifier - 53%

Sentimetre Model 1 - 53%

Sentimetre Model 2 - 57%

</code></pre>
<p>*Prediction accuracy on the test dataset:</p>

<pre><code>NTLK VADER Sentiment Analyzer - 50%

Linear Classifier - 52%

Sentimetre Model 1 - 51%

NASA IS OPENING AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION WITH BOEING OVER A SOFTWARE GLITCH THAT PREVENTED ITS UNMANNED ASTRONAUT CAPSULE FROM REACHING THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IN DECEMBER, THE AGENCY SAID ON TUESDAY.

JOHNSON/FILE PHOTO  BOEING CO\u2019S (BA.N) CST-100 STARLINER ASTRONAUT CAPSULE HAD A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH FOR ITS FIRST UNMANNED TEST MISSION, BUT WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS AN AUTOMATED TIMER ERROR PREVENTED THE SPACECRAFT FROM ATTAINING THE CORRECT ORBIT FOR IT TO RENDEZVOUS AND DOCK WITH THE SPACE STATION.  THE U.S. SPACE AGENCY IS FORMING AN INVESTIGATIVE TEAM TO DETERMINE WHAT CAUSED THE TIMER GLITCH AND \u201cANY OTHER SOFTWARE ISSUES,\u201d NASA SAID. THE TEAM WILL \u201cPROVIDE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS\u201d NEEDED BEFORE STARLINER CAN FLY A CREW OF ASTRONAUTS FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT ADDED, SAYING THE PROBE WILL TAKE ABOUT TWO MONTHS.  NASA SAID IT WAS WEIGHING WHETHER TO MAKE BOEING REPEAT THE TEST, WHICH WOULD LIKELY COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND ADD FURTHER DELAY, TO SHOW IT CAN DOCK AT THE STATION SUCCESSFULLY. DOCKING WAS A KEY REQUIREMENT FOR THE TEST UNDER BOEING\u2019S CONTRACT.  \u201cALTHOUGH DATA FROM THE UNCREWED TEST IS IMPORTANT FOR CERTIFICATION, IT MAY NOT BE THE ONLY WAY THAT BOEING IS ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE ITS SYSTEM\u2019S FULL CAPABILITIES,\u201d THE AGENCY SAID.  IT ADDED THAT IT WOULD TAKE NASA \u201cSEVERAL WEEKS\u201d TO DECIDE WHETHER BOEING WILL NEED TO RE-DO ITS TEST OR CARRY ON TO THE FINAL TEST FLIGHT OF LOFTING HUMANS TO THE SPACE STATION, SET FOR LATER THIS YEAR.  THE SPACECRAFT, A CONE-SHAPED POD WITH SEATS FOR SEVEN ASTRONAUTS, LANDED SUCCESSFULLY IN WHITE SANDS, NEW MEXICO SIX DAYS EARLIER THAN PLANNED, AFTER ITS DECEMBER LAUNCH.  THE LANDING, WHICH TESTED THE CAPSULE\u2019S DIFFICULT RE-ENTRY INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND PARACHUTE DEPLOYMENT, YIELDED THE MISSION\u2019S MOST VALUABLE TEST DATA, NASA ADMINISTRATOR JIM BRIDENSTINE SAID.  NASA AWARDED $4.2 BILLION TO BOEING AND $2.5 BILLION TO ELON MUSK\u2019S RIVAL SPACEX IN 2014 TO DEVELOP SEPARATE CAPSULE SYSTEMS CAPABLE OF FERRYING ASTRONAUTS TO THE SPACE STATION FROM U.S. SOIL FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE NASA\u2019S SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM ENDED IN 2011.

THE COMPANY HAS REPEATEDLY MISSED TARGETS IN RECENT YEARS AND MUSK\u2019S MERCURIAL BEHAVIOR HAS COME UNDER CLOSE SCRUTINY FROM FINANCIAL REGULATORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF TESLA.  HOWEVER, MOST MAINSTREAM AUTOMAKERS ARE STILL RAMPING UP NEW GENERATIONS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES DESIGNED TO COMPETE WITH TESLA\u2019S COMBINATION OF STYLE, TECHNOLOGY AND PERFORMANCE.  GERMAN AUTOMAKERS VOLKSWAGEN AG (VOWG_P.DE), DAIMLER AG (DAIGN.DE) AND BMW AG ALL HAVE PROMISED TO LAUNCH FULLY ELECTRIC PREMIUM MODELS. GM\u2019S CADILLAC LUXURY BRAND IS GEARING UP TO LAUNCH A SERIES OF ELECTRIC SUVS AND CARS, WHILE FORD\u2019S MUSTANG MACH-E ELECTRIC SUV, UNVEILED IN NOVEMBER, WILL LAUNCH LATER THIS YEAR AND COULD COMPETE WITH TESLA\u2019S MODEL X OR SOON-TO-LAUNCH MODEL Y SUVS. FORD, GM AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS HAVE ELECTRIC PICKUPS IN THE WORKS TO TAKE ON MUSK\u2019S FUTURISTIC CYBERTRUCK.

REUTERS/ALY SONG  RIVAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE MODELS FROM AUDI, JAGUAR AND PORSCHE HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF TESLA\u2019S DRIVING RANGE BETWEEN CHARGES AND FAILED TO MATCH TESLA\u2019S BRAND CACHET.  MORE ANALYSTS RATE TESLA \u201cSELL\u201d THAN \u201cBUY,\u201d WHICH IS EXTREMELY UNUSUAL FOR COMPANIES ON WALL STREET. ELEVEN ANALYSTS RECOMMEND BUYING TESLA SHARES, WHILE 13 RECOMMEND SELLING AND ANOTHER NINE ARE NEUTRAL, ACCORDING TO REFINITIV DATA.

LME VOLUMES BY CONTRACT: TMSNRT.RS/2UTKQU5    SHFE VOLUMES BY CONTRACT: TMSNRT.RS/2QVY54Q  BY ANDY HOME  LONDON, JAN 10 (REUTERS) - BASE METALS TRADING VOLUMES SHRANK ON ALL THREE MAJOR GLOBAL EXCHANGES LAST YEAR AS TRADE WAR UNCERTAINTY AND RANGE-BOUND MARKETS DAMPENED SPECULATIVE ACTIVITY.  \u2018DOCTOR COPPER\u2019 HAS LONG BEEN A FAVOURITE METALLIC PLAY AMONG PUNTERS AND SLIDING VOLUMES WERE SYMPTOMATIC OF A SECTOR THAT WAS LARGELY OUT OF FAVOUR WITH THE MONEY MEN.  THE LONDON METAL EXCHANGE\u2019S (LME) COPPER CONTRACT SAW ACTIVITY FALL BY 8% LAST YEAR. THE DECLINES WERE MORE PRONOUNCED ON BOTH THE CME AND SHANGHAI FUTURES EXCHANGES (SHFE) CONTRACTS WITH VOLUMES SLUMPING BY 25% AND 29% RESPECTIVELY.  ONLY NICKEL BUCKED THE BROADER TREND THANKS TO HEIGHTENED PRICE VOLATILITY AND THE METAL\u2019S ELECTRIC VEHICLE CREDENTIALS. TRADING VOLUMES ROSE BY 3% IN LONDON AND BY 40% IN SHANGHAI, WHERE NICKEL HAS ALSO ASSUMED THE ROLE OF JUNIOR PARTNER IN A PROXY TRADE WITH THE MUCH LARGER IRON ORE MARKET.  EXCHANGES CAN\u2019T DO MUCH ABOUT MANUFACTURING SLOWDOWN OR THE RESULTING RANGE-BOUND PRICING BUT THEY ARE EXPANDING THEIR PRODUCT RANGE AND OPENING UP ENTIRELY NEW MARKETS.  BASE METALS DOWNTURN  IT WAS A YEAR TO FORGET FOR MANY OF THE BASE METALS WITH COPPER, ALUMINIUM, ZINC AND LEAD CLOSING OUT 2019 LITTLE CHANGED FROM YEAR-START LEVELS.  TOTAL VOLUMES ON THE LONDON MARKET, WHICH STILL DOMINATES PHYSICAL PRICING, FELL BY 4.6% LAST YEAR AFTER A SIMILAR-SIZED RISE IN 2018.  IN TRUTH THE LME FARED SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN SUGGESTED BY THE HEADLINE FIGURE, WHICH INCLUDES SO-CALLED \u201cUNA\u201d TRADES INTRODUCED TO COMPLY WITH EUROPEAN MIFIDII REGULATIONS. STRIP THOSE OUT AND THE YEAR-ON-YEAR DECLINE WAS ONLY 1.9%.  EVEN SO, ACTIVITY ON ALL THE LME\u2019S CORE CONTRACTS FELL LAST YEAR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NICKEL, THE TOP PRICE PERFORMER AMONG THE BASE METALS IN 2019, AND TIN, THE WEAKEST PRICE PERFORMER. THE SAME TWO METALS WERE THE ONLY TWO TO REGISTER HIGHER VOLUMES IN SHANGHAI.  TIN REMAINS A TINY FUTURES MARKET BY COMPARISON WITH NICKEL BUT EVEN IT DWARFS THE LME\u2019S ALUMINIUM ALLOY CONTRACT, WHICH WITH VOLUME GROWTH OF 7% WAS THE UNLIKELY STAR PERFORMER LAST YEAR.  THAT OUTPERFORMANCE, HOWEVER, SHOULD BE SEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF FALLING ACTIVITY IN EACH OF THE PREVIOUS FOUR YEARS.  NEW PRODUCTS  THE LME LAUNCHED TWO NEW ALUMINIUM PREMIUM CONTRACTS IN MARCH LAST YEAR BUT WITH ONLY LIMITED SUCCESS. THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTRACT TRADED JUST 939 LOTS WHILE THE EUROPEAN PRODUCT FAILED TO TRADE AT ALL.  CME, WHICH LAUNCHED THE FIRST OF ITS FOUR ALUMINIUM PREMIUM CONTRACTS AS FAR BACK AS 2013, APPEARS TO HAVE CAPTURED THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE MARKET WITH TOTAL VOLUMES LAST YEAR OF 152,353 CONTRACTS.  ITS UNDERLYING ALUMINIUM CONTRACT LOOKED IN DANGER OF DISAPPEARING ALTOGETHER WITH NO TRADES AT ALL IN 2018 BUT THE CONTRACT SPRANG INTO LIFE IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2019 AFTER CME EXTENDED PHYSICAL DELIVERY TO ASIAN LOCATIONS SUCH AS SINGAPORE AND THE MALAYSIAN PORTS OF JOHOR AND PORT KLANG. THEY CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR 9,291 TONNES OF CME\u2019S TOTAL 17,145 TONNES OF REGISTERED ALUMINIUM STOCKS.  CME ZINC STOCKS HAVE SHRUNK TO JUST 6 TONNES AND THE CONTRACT, WHICH DIDN\u2019T TRADE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, LOOKS PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO FOLLOWING THE CME LEAD CONTRACT INTO OBLIVION.  VOLUMES IN THE CME\u2019S COPPER OPTIONS CONTRACT DOUBLED YEAR-ON-YEAR AND THE EXCHANGE\u2019S WEEKLY OPTIONS CONTRACTS, LAUNCHED IN 2018, STEADILY GAINED TRACTION OVER THE COURSE OF 2019.  AS DID THE SHFE COPPER OPTIONS CONTRACT, ALSO LAUNCHED IN 2018. ALMOST 8.4 MILLION LOTS TRADED IN 2019 WITH OPEN INTEREST IN DECEMBER STANDING AT 64,526 LOTS, UP 16% ON DECEMBER 2018.  MORE NEW BASE METAL PRODUCTS WERE LAUNCHED LAST YEAR BY HONG KONG EXCHANGES AND CLEARING (HKEX), THE OWNER OF THE LME.  A SUITE OF DOLLAR-DENOMINATED \u201cMINI\u201d CONTRACTS APPEAR TO BE SUCCEEDING WHERE THE YUAN-DENOMINATED OFFERING HAS LARGELY FAILED. TOTAL VOLUME WAS 29,334 CONTRACTS SINCE LAUNCH IN AUGUST, COMPARED WITH JUST 237 OVER THE WHOLE YEAR FOR THE CHINESE CURRENCY PRODUCTS.  THE NEW STEEL FRONTIER  ALL THREE EXCHANGES ARE ALSO MAKING STEADY INROADS INTO THE FERROUS SECTOR, WHICH HAS HISTORICALLY PROVED STUBBORNLY RESISTANT TO FUTURES TRADING.  THE LME\u2019S SCRAP AND REBAR CONTRACTS HAVE TRADED SINCE THE START OF 2018 AND ARE SEEING RESPECTABLE ACTIVITY. TWO NEW CONTRACTS, COVERING HOT ROLLED COIL (HRC) IN CHINA AND NORTH AMERICA, HAVE SEEN VOLUMES BUILD SINCE TRADING STARTED IN MARCH LAST YEAR. THE FORMER SET A NEW MONTHLY VOLUME RECORD OF 16,297 LOTS IN DECEMBER, BRINGING THE 2019 TOTAL TO 45,884 LOTS.  THE EXCHANGE HAS DROPPED PLENTY OF HINTS IT WILL CONSIDER BUILDING OUT ITS FERROUS PORTFOLIO FURTHER, GIVEN THE LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION IN THE CURRENT OFFERINGS.  IT\u2019S NOTICEABLE THAT THE CME\u2019S HRC CONTRACT HAS SEEN INCREASED ACTION SINCE THE LME RE-ENTERED THE STEEL SECTOR AFTER THE FAILURE OF ITS FORMER BILLET CONTRACT. CME VOLUMES GREW BY 89% IN 2018 AND BY ANOTHER 45% LAST YEAR, WHEN THE EQUIVALENT OF ALMOST 3.5 MILLION TONNES TRADED.  SHFE CURRENTLY RUNS THE HIGHEST-VOLUME GLOBAL STEEL CONTRACT. STEEL REBAR VOLUMES DROPPED 12% LAST YEAR BUT STILL TOTAL LED 930 MILLION CONTRACTS. EVEN ALLOWING FOR THE FACT THAT SHFE DOUBLE-COUNTS ITS VOLUMES, A PRACTICE THAT CHANGED AT THE START OF 2020, IT\u2019S STILL A STAGGERING FIGURE.  THE CHINESE EXCHANGE LAST YEAR EXTENDED ITS FERROUS PRODUCT RANGE WITH A NEW STAINLESS CONTRACT, WHICH TRADED 1.2 MILLION LOTS IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS.  QIANHAI SURPRISE  NOT ALL NEW PRODUCTS FLOURISH AND THE LME\u2019S NEW COBALT AND MOLYBDENUM CONTRACTS FAILED TO GET ANY TRACTION LAST YEAR.  THE LACK OF INTEREST IN THE NEW CASH-SETTLED COBALT CONTRACT IS PUZZLING, GIVEN THE STEADY DECLINE IN ACTIVITY IN THE OLDER PHYSICALLY DELIVERABLE CONTRACT, WHICH SAW VOLUMES SLUMP BY 26% LAST YEAR. IT\u2019S NOT AS IF COBALT HASN\u2019T BEEN VOLATILE OR THAT CARMAKERS HAVEN\u2019T EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR A WAY OF HEDGING A KEY INPUT INTO ELECTRIC BATTERIES.  ALSO STRANGE IS THE LACK OF TRACTION GAINED BY EITHER THE CME OR LME ALUMINA CONTRACTS, GIVEN THE SECTOR HAS SWITCHED TOWARDS SPOT PRICING.  CME ALUMINA VOLUMES FELL BY 79% LAST YEAR TO 118,200 TONNES, WHILE THE LME\u2019S NEW ALUMINA CONTRACT NOTCHED UP TRADES OF JUST 46,000 TONNES.  BOTH WERE ECLIPSED BY THE 374,011 TONNES TRADED ON THE QIANHAI MERCANTILE EXCHANGE, HKEX\u2019S FORAY INTO MAINLAND CHINA.  THE QME IS SOMETHING OF AN ANOMALY IN THE GLOBAL METALS EXCHANGE WORLD. BARRED FROM OFFERING FUTURES PRODUCTS IN MAINLAND CHINA, HKEX HAS BEEN BUILDING OUT A PHYSICAL EXCHANGE.  ALUMINA WAS ONE OF FIVE METALLIC OFFERINGS LAUNCHED LAST YEAR. THE OTHERS ARE COPPER CATHODE, COPPER ROD, ALUMINIUM INGOT AND ALUMINIUM BILLET.  IT\u2019S TAKEN SEVERAL YEARS FOR HKEX TO GET THE QME UP AND RUNNING BUT IT IS WORTH WATCHING BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS A CLEAR CHALLENGE TO THE CHINESE INCUMBENT IN SHANGHAI.  THE BIG THREE EXCHANGES CURRENTLY CO-EXIST IN A RELATIVELY PEACEFUL ORDER. WHAT THE CHINESE LIKE TO CALL A \u201cWIN-WIN\u201d SCENARIO MAY NOT LAST LONG IF QME PICKS UP TRADING MOMENTUM.", "Ticker": "CME", "Date": "2020-01-10T00:00:00", "key": "20200110CME", "labelr0": -1.6213364033194202, "labelr1": -0.4632112730996231, "labelr2": -0.2841187420397689, "labelr3": 0.7123206916879488, "labelr4": 1.0438515194380835, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.191, "compound": -0.3818, "0_day_return": -1.6213364033194178, "1_day_return": -1.6213364033194178, "2_day_return": -0.7460139450972902, "3_day_return": -0.03900726510315256, "4_day_return": 1.0044370764054733, "label": -1, "return": 0.0069762152039844535, "excess_return": -1.6283126185234025, "count_of_word": 1151, "pred": -1, "prof-1": 0.73361224, "prof1": 0.26638779999999995, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5029548857287194, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4970451142712806, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.73361224, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.26638779999999995, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.63761914, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.3623808, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5171162, "tr_prof1": 0.48288387, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.43608168, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.5639183000000001, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5931922, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.40680778, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.31144327, "headline_prof21": 0.68855673, "textplusheadline_pred": -1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.55452156, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.44547844, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.4296634, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.57033664, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.5086893, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.49131066, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 1.6213364033194178, "returnpredvader": 1.6213364033194178, "returnpredsgd": 1.6213364033194178, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0229408816193026, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9751898378088888, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.979797440948375, "cumreturn1b": 1.0607998354597037, "cumreturn1d": 0.9645906959320732, "cumreturn1e": 0.9983879290364635, "old_Date": 20200110, "cumreturndow": 1.0092944070749572, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0013249597823675}, {"Unnamed: 0": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16924, "level_0": 16924, "index": 16924, "text": "JAN 13 (REUTERS) - ACASTI PHARMA INC SAID ON MONDAY ITS KRILL OIL-DERIVED DRUG CANDIDATE, CAPRE, WAS NOT MORE EFFECTIVE THAN PLACEBO IN REDUCING HIGH LEVELS OF TRIGLYCERIDES IN A LATE-STAGE STUDY.

BUT THE GULF STATE, WHICH BECAME THE LARGEST SINGLE INVESTOR IN BARCLAYS, FIRST ASKED FOR A FEE OF 3.75% IN RETURN FOR ITS INVESTMENT \u2014 SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE THE 1.5% THE BANK WAS OFFERING OTHER INVESTORS, THE JURY HAS HEARD.  \u201cHIS (VARLEY\u2019S) IMMEDIATE REACTION WAS THAT HE WOULD BE PREPARED TO OFFER VALUE OF 3.5%...,\u201d KALARIS TOLD THE JURY AT THE OLD BAILEY CRIMINAL COURT, AS HE BEGAN HIS TESTIMONY.  \u201cHE SAID IT SHOULD BE DONE VIA A SIDE AGREEMENT\u201d, HE SAID, ADDING THIS WAS \u201cQUITE COMMON\u201d IN BANKING AND \u201cABSOLUTELY NOT\u201d DISHONEST.  VARLEY WAS ACQUITTED OF FRAUD CHARGES LAST YEAR AND IS NOT ACCUSED OF ANY WRONGDOING.  PROSECUTORS FOR THE UK SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE ALLEGE THE THREE FORMER EXECUTIVES LIED TO THE MARKET AND OTHER INVESTORS BY NOT PROPERLY DISCLOSING 322 MILLION POUNDS PAID TO QATAR, DISGUISING THEM AS \u201cBOGUS\u201d ADVISORY SERVICES AGREEMENTS (ASAS) IN RETURN FOR AROUND FOUR BILLION POUNDS IN INVESTMENTS OVER 2008.  KALARIS, WHO RAN THE BANK\u2019S WEALTH DIVISION, ROGER JENKINS, THE FORMER HEAD OF THE BANK\u2019S MIDDLE EAST BUSINESS AND RICHARD BOATH, A FORMER HEAD OF EUROPEAN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, DENY CONSPIRING TO COMMIT FRAUD AND FRAUD BY FALSE REPRESENTATION.  THE MEN HAVE SAID THE ASAS WERE DESIGNED TO BE GENUINE SIDE DEALS TO SECURE LUCRATIVE BUSINESS FOR BARCLAYS IN THE MIDDLE EAST \u2014 A REGION THE BANK WAS EAGER TO EXPLOIT \u2014 AND WERE APPROVED BY LAWYERS AND CLEARED BY THE BOARD.  KALARIS, 64, AGREED HIS ROLE IN THE JUNE 2008 CAPITAL RAISING COULD BE DESCRIBED AS A \u201cQUARTERBACK\u201d AND INVOLVED, IN PART, ENSURING DECISION MAKERS \u201cUNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS GOING ON\u201d.  \u201cDID YOU THINK FOR A MOMENT THAT MR VARLEY WAS INSTRUCTING THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME FORM OF DISHONEST OR HIDDEN NATURE TO THE BALANCING PAYMENT, WHATEVER THAT AMOUNT WOULD NEED TO BE?\u201d KALARIS\u2019S LAWYER, IAN WINTER, ASKED.  \u201cNEVER,\u201d KALARIS RESPONDED.

THAT PROCESS COULD DRAG ON FOR SOME TIME, AS THE LOWER COURT IN DECEMBER SAID SQM HAD NO WAY OF PROVING - AND THAT THE SMA HAD NO WAY OF VERIFYING - THAT THE MEASURES IT HAD PROPOSED WERE CAPABLE OF \u201cCONTAINING AND REDUCING OR ELIMINATING THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS GENERATED BY THE BREACHES OF THE COMPANY.\u201d  SQM DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REPLY TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT ON THE LATEST TWIST IN THE LONG-RUNNING LEGAL BATTLE.

THE NET INCREASE IN U.S. SUBSCRIBERS IS WANING IN PART THANKS TO A PRICE HIKE AND NEW ENTRANTS.

ATLANTIA HAS BEEN UNDER PRESSURE SINCE AUGUST 2018 WHEN A BRIDGE OPERATED BY ITS MOTORWAY UNIT AUTOSTRADE PER L\u2019ITALIA COLLAPSED IN THE PORT CITY OF GENOA, KILLING 43 PEOPLE.

HE PAID WAY ABOVE THE ODDS FOR A COUPLE OF COMPANIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO LEAVE BEHIND THE COMPANY\u2019S STODGY IMAGE - BEFORE BEING EFFECTIVELY FORCED OUT IN 2014. ROMETTY, MEANWHILE, SPLASHED OUT TOO MUCH IN HER $34 BILLION ACQUISITION OF RED HAT UNVEILED IN 2018.  NADELLA MANAGED TO GET PAST BALLMER\u2019S DEALS, DESPITE ADDING A PRICEY-LOOKING TAKEOVER OF HIS OWN WITH LINKEDIN, AND HAS OVERSEEN A LARGELY SUCCESSFUL UPGRADE AND EXPANSION OF ITS SOFTWARE WHILE ALSO GROWING ITS CLOUD-COMPUTING BUSINESS, WHERE REVENUE GREW 62% IN ITS MOST RECENT QUARTER. THAT MAKES IT THE MAIN CONTENDER TO INDUSTRY LEADER AMAZON. OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY HAS INCREASED SIX-FOLD TO $1.3 TRILLION.  THERE\u2019S PLENTY THAT COULD GO WRONG, OF COURSE. KRISHNA, WHO CURRENTLY LEADS THE CLOUD DIVISION, WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE RED HAT DEAL. THAT WAS DESIGNED TO CATAPULT IBM INTO THE CLOUD BUSINESS BUT HAS YET TO SHOW THE PURCHASE WAS WORTH THE PRICE PAID. THE FATE OF FINNISH TELECOM COMPANY NOKIA PROVIDES AN INSTRUMENTAL LESSON ON HOW TURNAROUND ATTEMPTS CAN SPIRAL DOWN. IT WAS ONCE, LIKE IBM, A DOMINANT HARDWARE MAKER BEFORE FALLING ON HARD TIMES. IT SOLD PART OF ITS BUSINESS TO MICROSOFT \u2013 ONE OF BALLMER\u2019S BAD DEALS \u2013 AND SHARES IN THE REST NOW TRADE AT JUST 6% OF THEIR MARKET HIGH IN 2000. YAHOO IS ANOTHER TALE OF WOE. THE INTERNET GIANT\u2019S MAIN BUSINESS LOST ALMOST ALL OF ITS VALUE DURING A 10-YEAR PERIOD BEFORE IT WAS SOLD TO VERIZON.  KRISHNA HAS TO PUSH TO BE IN MICROSOFT\u2019S CAMP, BUT HE\u2019S GOT HIS WORK CUT OUT FOR HIM.", "Ticker": "IBM", "Date": "2020-01-31T00:00:00", "key": "20200131IBM", "labelr0": 5.088835270892724, "labelr1": 1.7672023933764842, "labelr2": 1.941614821904699, "labelr3": 4.842062906579034, "labelr4": 0.27505916970509714, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.0, "0_day_return": 5.088835270892721, "1_day_return": 5.088835270892721, "2_day_return": 3.7431294788840224, "3_day_return": 8.766437069505306, "4_day_return": 9.065609128226493, "label": 1, "return": 0.007254613784725513, "excess_return": 5.081580657107996, "count_of_word": 404, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.4753739000000001, "prof1": 0.52462614, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4889046559551323, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5110953440448677, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.4753739000000001, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.52462614, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.4976825, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.5023175, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.43864906, "tr_prof1": 0.561351, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.7258688, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.27413118, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.48038927, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.5196107, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.6652165, "headline_prof21": 0.33478352, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.47089538, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.52910465, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.50425446, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.4957455, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.32224974, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.67775023, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 5.088835270892721, "returnpredvader": -5.088835270892721, "returnpredsgd": 5.088835270892721, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0120240260306959, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9975015561605984, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.005841387616361, "cumreturn1b": 1.1894332752035002, "cumreturn1d": 0.976279927884053, "cumreturn1e": 1.0652519705653793, "old_Date": 20200131, "cumreturndow": 0.9972588744934952, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9837544261863257}, {"Unnamed: 0": 17876, "Unnamed: 0.1": 17876, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 17876, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 17876, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 17876, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 17876, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 17876, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 17876, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 17876, "level_0": 17876, "index": 17876, "text": "(REFILES TO ADD DROPPED WORD \u2018CITI\u2019 IN HEADLINE)  FEB 3 (REUTERS) - PETER CRAWLEY HAS BEEN APPOINTED AS CITIGROUP INC\u2019S TREASURY AND TRADE SOLUTIONS (TTS) HEAD FOR BRITAIN AND EUROPE, BASED IN LONDON AND WILL MOVE INTO HIS NEW ROLE WITH EFFECT FROM APRIL 6, ACCORDING TO A MEMO SEEN BY REUTERS.

FILE PHOTO: GENERAL MOTORS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER MARY BARRA ANNOUNCES A MAJOR INVESTMENT FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF GM FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES AT THE GM ORION ASSEMBLY PLANT IN LAKE ORION, MICHIGAN, U.S. MARCH 22, 2019. REUTERS/REBECCA COOK/FILE PHOTO  GM CHIEF EXECUTIVE MARY BARRA AND TOP EXECUTIVES HOSTED AN INVESTOR CONFERENCE IN NEW YORK TO CONVINCE POTENTIAL SHAREHOLDERS GM IS A BURGEONING TECHNOLOGY FIRM AT THE FOREFRONT OF TOMORROW\u2019S ELECTRIC AND SELF-DRIVING CARS.  \u201cWE BELIEVE WE\u2019RE A COMPELLING INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY,\u201d GM CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER DHIVYA SURYADEVARA TOLD REPORTERS AFTER GM REPORTED QUARTERLY RESULTS, WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE RUN-UP IN TESLA\u2019S STOCK.  \u201cFROM A SHARE-PRICE STANDPOINT, WE\u2019RE VERY BULLISH ON THE FUTURE,\u201d SHE ADDED.  BARRA HAS BEEN RESTRUCTURING GM\u2019S OPERATIONS AND STRESSING HER GOALS OF READYING GM FOR A FUTURE OF \u201cZERO EMISSIONS AND ZERO ACCIDENTS\u201d FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  STILL, GM SHARES TRADE JUST ABOVE THE $33 SHARE PRICE OF ITS 2010 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING. THAT HAS LEFT IT WITH A MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF ABOUT $49 BILLION, BELOW TESLA\u2019S VALUATION OF ABOUT $130 BILLION.  \u201cTHE MARKET\u2019S GOT IT WRONG,\u201d SAID CHRIS SUSANIN, CO-PORTFOLIO MANAGER WITH LEVIN EASTERLY PARTNERS, WHICH OWNS SHARES IN GM BUT NOT TESLA. \u201cGM SHOULD BE THE $150 BILLION MARKET CAP, NOT TESLA.\u201d  THE BULK OF GM\u2019S PROFITS IS STILL DERIVED FROM THE FUEL-HUNGRY PICKUP TRUCKS AND SUVS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES. THE CHINESE MARKET HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF A STEADY $2 BILLION IN PROFITS A YEAR, BUT THAT IS THREATENED BY A MARKET SLOWDOWN, RISING COSTS FOR ELECTRIFICATION AND NOW THE DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK.  WHILE CHINA WILL DELIVER LOWER EQUITY INCOME TO GM IN THE NEAR TERM, IT REMAINS A SOLID CONTRIBUTOR THAT IS PROFITABLE AND DIVIDEND PAYING, AND WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVS GLOBALLY, OFFICIALS SAID. GM ALSO SEES GROWTH FOR ITS CADILLAC BRAND IN CHINA.  \u2018HAVE OUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO\u2019  BARRA\u2019S CHALLENGE NOW IS TO ASSURE INVESTORS THAT GM CAN MAKE THE LEAP ACROSS THE GAP SEPARATING ITS PROFITABLE INTERNAL COMBUSTION PRESENT AND AN UNCERTAIN ELECTRIC FUTURE.  WHILE GASOLINE-POWERED VEHICLES WILL MAKE UP A LARGE PORTION OF U.S. SALES INTO THE 2030S, GM HAS SAID IT WILL SPEND MORE ON DEVELOPING ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAN THOSE WITH INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.  GM LAID OUT A MORE DETAILED PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVS AND SELF-DRIVING VEHICLES AT THE INVESTOR DAY, INCLUDING ITS CRUISE SELF-DRIVING UNIT.  SOME ANALYSTS HAVE SUGGESTED GM SHOULD SPIN OFF CRUISE, BUT SURYADEVARA SAID GM HAS NO PLANS TO DO THAT. SHE ADDED THAT SPENDING IN 2020 ON THAT BUSINESS WILL ROUGHLY MATCH LAST YEAR\u2019S $800 MILLION.  CRUISE CEO DAN AMMANN SAID THE SELF-DRIVING MARKET OPPORTUNITY TOTALS $8 TRILLION.  ONE OF THE AUDIENCES FOR THE INVESTOR DAY IS POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES AS GM COMPETES WITH TESLA AND OTHER AUTOMAKERS GLOBALLY TO HIRE TOP ENGINEERS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS OUTSIDE OF DETROIT, HIGHLIGHTING TECHNICAL CENTERS IN ONTARIO AND ISRAEL.  BARRA, ASKED WHETHER TESLA\u2019S EVENTUAL ELECTRIC PICKUP OFFERING COULD SQUEEZE GM\u2019S MARGINS, SAID HER COMPANY UNDERSTANDS THAT BUSINESS. \u201cI THINK WE CAN HAVE OUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO,\u201d SHE SAID.  GM ALSO SAID IT WILL OFFER ITS SUPERCRUISE PARTIALLY AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEM ON 22 MODELS BY THE END OF 2023, GM PRESIDENT MARK REUSS SAID.  GM ALSO LAID OUT ITS PLAN TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING COMPLEXITY THIS YEAR BY ELIMINATING 25% OF THE PARTS USED IN ITS PLANTS. BARRA ALSO SAID GM TARGETS SOURCING ALL OF ITS GLOBAL ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES BY 2040, A DECADE SOONER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROMISED.

HC2 SAID LAST MONTH THAT IT PLANNED TO PUT GLAZER, WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE CO-CHAIRMAN AND DIRECTOR OF SOCCER CLUB MANCHESTER UNITED PLC (MANU.N), ONTO ITS SLATE FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO VOTE ON AT THE ANNUAL MEETING IN JULY.  THE FOURTH BOARD SEAT HAS GONE TO SHELLY LOMBARD, A REPRESENTATIVE OF HC2 SHAREHOLDER JDS1.  AFTER NEW ADDITIONS, THE BOARD WOULD EXPAND TO 10 MEMBERS FROM SIX AND WOULD BE REDUCED TO SEVEN AFTER THIS YEAR\u2019S ANNUAL MEETING IN JULY, THE COMPANY SAID IN A STATEMENT.  AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT, MG CAPITAL HAS ALSO WITHDRAWN ITS CONSENT SOLICITATION AND NOMINATION FOR ELECTION OF DIRECTORS AT THE 2020 ANNUAL MEETING.  MG CAPITAL COULD NOT BE IMMEDIATELY REACHED FOR COMMENT.  REUTERS REPORTED ON WEDNESDAY THAT THE TWO SIDES WERE NEARING A SETTLEMENT.  THIS WAS ONE OF ONLY A FEW CAMPAIGNS THAT HAD NOT SETTLED QUICKLY THIS YEAR AS THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK SHUTTERED MUCH OF THE U.S. ECONOMY.  IT PITTED GORZYNSKI, WHO ONCE WORKED FOR PROMINENT HEDGE FUND MANAGER DANIEL LOEB, AGAINST FALCONE, A FORMER BILLIONAIRE WHOSE BET AGAINST THE OVERHEATED HOUSING MARKET EARNED HIS FUND HARBINGER CAPITAL A 116% RETURN IN 2007.  IN THE LAST DECADE, FALCONE HAS TURNED FROM FUND INVESTOR TO CORPORATE EXECUTIVE.  WARREN GFELLER, CURRENTLY THE INTERIM NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND WHO HAS BEEN ON THE HC2 BOARD SINCE 2016, AND WAYNE BARR, WHO HAS BEEN A DIRECTOR SINCE 2014, WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE AS DIRECTORS, ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENT.  PROXY ADVISERS ISS AND GLASS LEWIS BOTH SUPPORTED MG\u2019S CAMPAIGN, WITH ISS, THE BIGGER AND MORE INFLUENTIAL OF THE TWO, RECOMMENDING THAT SHAREHOLDERS ELECT THREE MG DIRECTORS BUT NOT GORZYNSKI. GLASS LEWIS, IN AN RARE MOVE, BACKED ALL SIX MG DIRECTORS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE BOARD.", "Ticker": "HCHC", "Date": "2020-05-14T00:00:00", "key": "20200514HCHC", "labelr0": -20.529801324503318, "labelr1": 2.9166666666666785, "labelr2": 2.429149797570834, "labelr3": 0.3952569169960566, "labelr4": 4.330708661417319, "pos": 0.107, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.0516, "0_day_return": -20.529801324503318, "1_day_return": -20.529801324503318, "2_day_return": 5.416666666666646, "3_day_return": 5.833333333333335, "4_day_return": 10.416666666666652, "label": -1, "return": 0.003926363190184069, "excess_return": -20.533727687693503, "count_of_word": 458, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5530624, "prof1": 0.44693765, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4492645243238046, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5507354756761954, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5530624, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.44693765, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.34369758, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.6563024000000001, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.45469534, "tr_prof1": 0.5453047, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.29165936, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.7083406, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.576961, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.4230390000000001, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.55339545, "headline_prof21": 0.44660452, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.45967359999999996, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5403264, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.33680493, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.663195, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.20577070000000003, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.7942293, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": -20.529801324503318, "returnpredvader": -20.529801324503318, "returnpredsgd": -20.529801324503318, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9978427928664635, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9989863047123414, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9980768636009617, "cumreturn1b": 1.240818649069201, "cumreturn1d": 0.8263407383608479, "cumreturn1e": 1.0979314454596174, "old_Date": 20200514, "cumreturndow": 0.8790152600201073, "cumreturnsp500": 0.8204504268008447}, {"Unnamed: 0": 27122, "Unnamed: 0.1": 27122, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 27122, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 27122, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 27122, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 27122, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 27122, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 27122, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 27122, "level_0": 27122, "index": 27122, "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO (REUTERS) - BRAZIL\u2019S STATE-RUN PETROBRAS SEES NO NEED FOR CUTS IN OIL PRODUCTION, EXECUTIVES SAY, AS THE MARKET FOR ITS CRUDE REMAINS ROBUST IN CHINA, WHILE DOMESTIC DEMAND FOR FUEL PICKS UP AMID SOCIAL DISTANCING FATIGUE IN LATIN AMERICA\u2019S LARGEST ECONOMY.

ON THURSDAY NIGHT, THE COMPANY POSTED MARGINS THAT BEAT EXPECTATIONS, EVEN AS IT TOOK A $11 BILLION IMPAIRMENT ON ITS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ASSETS.

THAT ARE EXPERIENCING DECLINING PRODUCTION,\u201d HE SAID.  HE ADDED THAT PETROBRAS HAS CAPACITY TO BOOST OIL EXPORTS 10% ABOVE THE APRIL RECORD OF 1 MILLION BPD.  IN A SIGN THAT ADHERENCE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES IS SLIPPING FROM AN ALREADY LOW BASELINE IN BRAZIL, PETROBRAS DOWNSTREAM CHIEF ANELISE LARA TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT DOMESTIC DEMAND FOR GASOLINE AND DIESEL HAD REBOUNDED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM LOWS IN EARLY APRIL.  WHILE DEMAND FOR GASOLINE HAD BEEN 65% LOWER THAN NORMAL, IT IS NOW OFF ONLY 40% TO 45%, SHE SAID. DIESEL CONSUMPTION HAD FALLEN 50%, BUT IS NOW ONLY 30% OFF NORMAL LEVELS.

JOHNSON/FILE PHOTO  BOEING CO\u2019S (BA.N) CST-100 STARLINER ASTRONAUT CAPSULE HAD A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH FOR ITS FIRST UNMANNED TEST MISSION, BUT WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS AN AUTOMATED TIMER ERROR PREVENTED THE SPACECRAFT FROM ATTAINING THE CORRECT ORBIT FOR IT TO RENDEZVOUS AND DOCK WITH THE SPACE STATION.  THE U.S. SPACE AGENCY IS FORMING AN INVESTIGATIVE TEAM TO DETERMINE WHAT CAUSED THE TIMER GLITCH AND \u201cANY OTHER SOFTWARE ISSUES,\u201d NASA SAID. THE TEAM WILL \u201cPROVIDE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS\u201d NEEDED BEFORE STARLINER CAN FLY A CREW OF ASTRONAUTS FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT ADDED, SAYING THE PROBE WILL TAKE ABOUT TWO MONTHS.  NASA SAID IT WAS WEIGHING WHETHER TO MAKE BOEING REPEAT THE TEST, WHICH WOULD LIKELY COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND ADD FURTHER DELAY, TO SHOW IT CAN DOCK AT THE STATION SUCCESSFULLY. DOCKING WAS A KEY REQUIREMENT FOR THE TEST UNDER BOEING\u2019S CONTRACT.  \u201cALTHOUGH DATA FROM THE UNCREWED TEST IS IMPORTANT FOR CERTIFICATION, IT MAY NOT BE THE ONLY WAY THAT BOEING IS ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE ITS SYSTEM\u2019S FULL CAPABILITIES,\u201d THE AGENCY SAID.  IT ADDED THAT IT WOULD TAKE NASA \u201cSEVERAL WEEKS\u201d TO DECIDE WHETHER BOEING WILL NEED TO RE-DO ITS TEST OR CARRY ON TO THE FINAL TEST FLIGHT OF LOFTING HUMANS TO THE SPACE STATION, SET FOR LATER THIS YEAR.  THE SPACECRAFT, A CONE-SHAPED POD WITH SEATS FOR SEVEN ASTRONAUTS, LANDED SUCCESSFULLY IN WHITE SANDS, NEW MEXICO SIX DAYS EARLIER THAN PLANNED, AFTER ITS DECEMBER LAUNCH.  THE LANDING, WHICH TESTED THE CAPSULE\u2019S DIFFICULT RE-ENTRY INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND PARACHUTE DEPLOYMENT, YIELDED THE MISSION\u2019S MOST VALUABLE TEST DATA, NASA ADMINISTRATOR JIM BRIDENSTINE SAID.

BUT BANK SOURCES SAY A PUSH BY THE EU FOR FISHING ACCESS TO UK WATERS AND LONDON\u2019S STANCE THAT IT WILL DIVERGE FROM EU RULES ARE PROMPTING THEM TO REVIEW HARD-BREXIT PLANS THAT COULD SEE MORE JOBS THAN ANTICIPATED MOVE TO EUROPE.  UNTIL NOW, FINANCIAL FIRMS RUNNING EU OPERATIONS FROM BRITAIN BELIEVED THAT TECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS BY EU BANKING, INSURANCE AND MARKETS REGULATORS WOULD BE ENOUGH JUDGE UK RULES \u2018EQUIVALENT\u2019 TO THOSE GOVERNING EU-BASED FIRMS, GRANTING THEM MARKET ACCESS AFTER DECEMBER.  BUT BANKING SOURCES SAY THE EU\u2019S EXECUTIVE NOW SEES THINGS DIFFERENTLY.  SOURCES FROM THREE INTERNATIONAL BANKS FEAR THAT ACCESS WILL DEPEND ON A BROADER TRADE-OFF SUCH AS BRITAIN ALLOWING FISHING IN ITS WATERS \u2014 A CONCESSION THEY FEEL THE GOVERNMENT IS RELUCTANT TO MAKE.  \u201cWE\u2019RE NOW HEARING VERY EXPLICITLY \u2014 IT\u2019S NOT EVEN THE RUMOUR MILL \u2014 THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION HAS SAID THESE ARE POLITICALLY LINKED TO PROGRESS IN PHASE-TWO NEGOTIATIONS,\u201d ONE BANKING SOURCE TOLD REUTERS.  \u201cAS ONE OFFICIAL PUT IT TO ME, IF \u2018FISH FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES\u2019 IS GOING BADLY, THIS WILL IMPACT THE COMMISSION\u2019S WILLINGNESS TO GRANT EQUIVALENCE.\u201d  THE FISHING INDUSTRY IS VALUED AT ABOUT 169 TIMES LESS THAN FINANCIAL SERVICES AND OFFICIAL DATA SHOWS IT EMPLOYS JUST 8,000 PEOPLE COMPARED TO MORE THAN A MILLION IN FINANCE.  BUT REGAINING CONTROL OF BRITAIN\u2019S RICH FISHING WATERS WAS A TOTEM FOR BREXIT CAMPAIGNERS.  A EUROPEAN COMMISSION SPOKESMAN REFERRED TO A JANUARY EU DOCUMENT SAYING THE BLOC AND BRITAIN SHOULD ENDEAVOUR TO COMPLETE EQUIVALENCE ASSESSMENTS BEFORE JUNE 30. HE DECLINED TO COMMENT FURTHER.  THE EU IS BRITAIN\u2019S BIGGEST FINANCIAL SERVICES EXPORT MARKET, WORTH ABOUT 26 BILLION POUNDS ANNUALLY.  SINCE THE 2016 BREXIT VOTE, THE SECTOR HAS REORGANISED TO PRESERVE A FOOTHOLD IN THE EU, LAUNCHING OR BEEFING UP SUBSIDIARIES AND RELOCATING STAFF AND CAPITAL. MANY BANKS AND MONEY MANAGERS ARE PREPARING FOR A FURTHER TRANSFER OF RESOURCES AFTER A TRANSITION PERIOD ENDS IN DECEMBER.  CONSULTANTS EY SAID THIS WEEK THAT AROUND 7,000 FINANCIAL SERVICES JOBS WILL MOVE FROM BRITAIN TO STAFF NEW EU HUBS.  FAILING TO OBTAIN EQUIVALENCE COULD ADD RISK-MANAGEMENT, COMPLIANCE, MIDDLE AND BACK OFFICE ROLES TO THAT FIGURE, AS WELL AS TRADING AND CLIENT-FACING JOBS, THE SOURCES SAID.  FINANCE MINISTER SAJID JAVID SAID LAST WEEK THAT BRITAIN WOULD NOT BE A RULE-TAKER AFTER BREXIT, EVEN THOUGH SOME BUSINESSES COULD SUFFER FROM REGULATORY DIVERGENCE.  HE WANTS \u201cOUTCOMES-BASED\u201d EQUIVALENCE IN FINANCIAL SERVICES, MEANING UK RULES NEED NOT BE IDENTICAL TO THOSE IN THE EU BUT SHOULD HAVE THE SAME EFFECT.  THE EU UPDATED ITS EQUIVALENCE POLICY AHEAD OF BREXIT, SAYING THIRD-COUNTRY REGIMES LIKE THOSE IN JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES DO NOT NEED TO BE IDENTICAL BUT MUST HAVE THE SAME \u201cOUTCOMES\u201d AS EU RULES TO GIVE ACCESS TO ITS MARKETS.  BUT IT WOULD IMPOSE TOUGHER SCRUTINY OF \u201cHIGH-IMPACT\u201d COUNTRIES, EXPECTED TO INCLUDE BRITAIN.  THE EU\u2019S WITHDRAWAL OF SHARE TRADING EQUIVALENCE FROM SWITZERLAND DURING A DISPUTE OVER A PARTNERSHIP TREATY, NOT BECAUSE OF ANY DIVERGENCE IN RULES, SHOWED HOW EQUIVALENCE CAN BE POLITICISED.  BRITAIN\u2019S FINANCE MINISTRY HAD NO IMMEDIATE COMMENT.  COST AND SCRUTINY  BANKERS SAY JOBS TRANSFERRED TO EUROPE AS POLITICIANS WRANGLE ARE LIKELY TO STAY THERE, EVEN IF EQUIVALENCE IS EVENTUALLY GRANTED.  \u201cTHE SECTOR\u2019S APPROACH HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO PREPARE IN A WAY FOR THE WORST,\u201d A SECOND SENIOR BANKING SOURCE SAID.  SPEAKING AT THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM IN DAVOS THIS WEEK, DEUTSCHE BANK CEO CHRISTIAN SEWING RECOGNISED THE RISK THAT A TRADE DEAL WOULD NOT BE FINALISED BEFORE END-2020.  HE SAID HIS BANK \u201cCOULD DO EVERYTHING OUT OF FRANKFURT\u201d BUT THAT BRITAIN WOULD REMAIN AN IMPORTANT CAPITAL MARKET.  FINANCIAL LOBBY GROUPS HAVE WARNED THAT IF BRITAIN DOES NOT GET EQUIVALENCE, THE GOVERNMENT WILL LOSE VALUABLE TAX REVENUE.  THE BLOC IS THE BIGGEST CUSTOMER FOR BRITAIN\u2019S FINANCIAL SERVICES EXPORTS, WORTH ABOUT 26 BILLION POUNDS ANNUALLY BASED ON UNFETTERED ACCESS.  BUT LAWMAKERS FROM JOHNSON\u2019S CONSERVATIVE PARTY SAY THE CITY COULD COPE WITH THE FALLOUT IF NEGOTIATIONS TURNED SOUR.  \u201cLONDON IS A MARKETPLACE. THE MARKETPLACE DOESN\u2019T COME TO THEM (THE EU) ... THE HEALTH OF THE CITY DOESN\u2019T DEPEND NEARLY TO THE EXTENT THAT IS BELIEVED ON HAVING SOME PRIVILEGED POSITION IN THE EU,\u201d SAID PETER LILLEY, WHO SITS IN PARLIAMENT\u2019S UPPER CHAMBER.  A SECOND CONSERVATIVE LAWMAKER, TIM LOUGHTON, SAID JOHNSON WOULD NOT CONSIDER SWAPPING ASSETS SUCH AS FISHING RIGHTS TO CUT A BETTER DEAL FOR BANKS, WHICH HAVE STRUGGLED TO REBUILD THEIR IMAGE SINCE THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS.  HE SAID THE EU WAS BLUFFING AND WOULD NOT POLITICIZE FINANCIAL SERVICES BECAUSE IT, TOO, RISKED LOSING ACCESS TO THE REGION\u2019S DEEPEST MARKETS.  \u201cIT WOULD BE A MASSIVE EXERCISE IN CUTTING OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE,\u201d HE SAID.

THE TWO COMPANIES WERE BOTH WORTH ROUGHLY $220 BILLION WHEN ROMETTY TOOK CHARGE OF IBM. ONE OF HER RECENT STRATEGIC MOVES EVEN ECHOES THOSE OF FORMER MICROSOFT BOSS STEVE BALLMER. HE PAID WAY ABOVE THE ODDS FOR A COUPLE OF COMPANIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO LEAVE BEHIND THE COMPANY\u2019S STODGY IMAGE - BEFORE BEING EFFECTIVELY FORCED OUT IN 2014. ROMETTY, MEANWHILE, SPLASHED OUT TOO MUCH IN HER $34 BILLION ACQUISITION OF RED HAT UNVEILED IN 2018.  NADELLA MANAGED TO GET PAST BALLMER\u2019S DEALS, DESPITE ADDING A PRICEY-LOOKING TAKEOVER OF HIS OWN WITH LINKEDIN, AND HAS OVERSEEN A LARGELY SUCCESSFUL UPGRADE AND EXPANSION OF ITS SOFTWARE WHILE ALSO GROWING ITS CLOUD-COMPUTING BUSINESS, WHERE REVENUE GREW 62% IN ITS MOST RECENT QUARTER.

FILE PHOTO: GENERAL MOTORS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER MARY BARRA ANNOUNCES A MAJOR INVESTMENT FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF GM FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES AT THE GM ORION ASSEMBLY PLANT IN LAKE ORION, MICHIGAN, U.S. MARCH 22, 2019. REUTERS/REBECCA COOK/FILE PHOTO  GM CHIEF EXECUTIVE MARY BARRA AND TOP EXECUTIVES HOSTED AN INVESTOR CONFERENCE IN NEW YORK TO CONVINCE POTENTIAL SHAREHOLDERS GM IS A BURGEONING TECHNOLOGY FIRM AT THE FOREFRONT OF TOMORROW\u2019S ELECTRIC AND SELF-DRIVING CARS.  \u201cWE BELIEVE WE\u2019RE A COMPELLING INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY,\u201d GM CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER DHIVYA SURYADEVARA TOLD REPORTERS AFTER GM REPORTED QUARTERLY RESULTS, WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE RUN-UP IN TESLA\u2019S STOCK.  \u201cFROM A SHARE-PRICE STANDPOINT, WE\u2019RE VERY BULLISH ON THE FUTURE,\u201d SHE ADDED.  BARRA HAS BEEN RESTRUCTURING GM\u2019S OPERATIONS AND STRESSING HER GOALS OF READYING GM FOR A FUTURE OF \u201cZERO EMISSIONS AND ZERO ACCIDENTS\u201d FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  STILL, GM SHARES TRADE JUST ABOVE THE $33 SHARE PRICE OF ITS 2010 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING. THAT HAS LEFT IT WITH A MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF ABOUT $49 BILLION, BELOW TESLA\u2019S VALUATION OF ABOUT $130 BILLION.  \u201cTHE MARKET\u2019S GOT IT WRONG,\u201d SAID CHRIS SUSANIN, CO-PORTFOLIO MANAGER WITH LEVIN EASTERLY PARTNERS, WHICH OWNS SHARES IN GM BUT NOT TESLA. \u201cGM SHOULD BE THE $150 BILLION MARKET CAP, NOT TESLA.\u201d  THE BULK OF GM\u2019S PROFITS IS STILL DERIVED FROM THE FUEL-HUNGRY PICKUP TRUCKS AND SUVS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES. THE CHINESE MARKET HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF A STEADY $2 BILLION IN PROFITS A YEAR, BUT THAT IS THREATENED BY A MARKET SLOWDOWN, RISING COSTS FOR ELECTRIFICATION AND NOW THE DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK.  WHILE CHINA WILL DELIVER LOWER EQUITY INCOME TO GM IN THE NEAR TERM, IT REMAINS A SOLID CONTRIBUTOR THAT IS PROFITABLE AND DIVIDEND PAYING, AND WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVS GLOBALLY, OFFICIALS SAID. GM ALSO SEES GROWTH FOR ITS CADILLAC BRAND IN CHINA.  \u2018HAVE OUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO\u2019  BARRA\u2019S CHALLENGE NOW IS TO ASSURE INVESTORS THAT GM CAN MAKE THE LEAP ACROSS THE GAP SEPARATING ITS PROFITABLE INTERNAL COMBUSTION PRESENT AND AN UNCERTAIN ELECTRIC FUTURE.  WHILE GASOLINE-POWERED VEHICLES WILL MAKE UP A LARGE PORTION OF U.S. SALES INTO THE 2030S, GM HAS SAID IT WILL SPEND MORE ON DEVELOPING ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAN THOSE WITH INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.  GM LAID OUT A MORE DETAILED PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVS AND SELF-DRIVING VEHICLES AT THE INVESTOR DAY, INCLUDING ITS CRUISE SELF-DRIVING UNIT.  SOME ANALYSTS HAVE SUGGESTED GM SHOULD SPIN OFF CRUISE, BUT SURYADEVARA SAID GM HAS NO PLANS TO DO THAT. SHE ADDED THAT SPENDING IN 2020 ON THAT BUSINESS WILL ROUGHLY MATCH LAST YEAR\u2019S $800 MILLION.  CRUISE CEO DAN AMMANN SAID THE SELF-DRIVING MARKET OPPORTUNITY TOTALS $8 TRILLION.  ONE OF THE AUDIENCES FOR THE INVESTOR DAY IS POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES AS GM COMPETES WITH TESLA AND OTHER AUTOMAKERS GLOBALLY TO HIRE TOP ENGINEERS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS OUTSIDE OF DETROIT, HIGHLIGHTING TECHNICAL CENTERS IN ONTARIO AND ISRAEL.  BARRA, ASKED WHETHER TESLA\u2019S EVENTUAL ELECTRIC PICKUP OFFERING COULD SQUEEZE GM\u2019S MARGINS, SAID HER COMPANY UNDERSTANDS THAT BUSINESS. \u201cI THINK WE CAN HAVE OUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO,\u201d SHE SAID.  GM ALSO SAID IT WILL OFFER ITS SUPERCRUISE PARTIALLY AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEM ON 22 MODELS BY THE END OF 2023, GM PRESIDENT MARK REUSS SAID.  GM ALSO LAID OUT ITS PLAN TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING COMPLEXITY THIS YEAR BY ELIMINATING 25% OF THE PARTS USED IN ITS PLANTS. BARRA ALSO SAID GM TARGETS SOURCING ALL OF ITS GLOBAL ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES BY 2040, A DECADE SOONER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROMISED.  IN DECEMBER, GM AND SOUTH KOREA\u2019S LG CHEM (051910.KS) SAID THEY WOULD INVEST $2.3 BILLION TO BUILD AN EV BATTERY CELL JOINT VENTURE PLANT IN OHIO, CREATING ONE OF THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST BATTERY FACILITIES.  THAT SAME MONTH, GM\u2019S CADILLAC CHIEF SAID MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE VEHICLES OFFERED BY THE LUXURY BRAND WOULD BE ELECTRIC BY 2030.

THE PLAN IS TO GROW IN THE THREE MAJOR MARKETS WHERE HSBC HAS SCALE, NAMELY BRITAIN, HONG KONG AND MEXICO, FOCUSING ON MORTGAGES, WEALTH AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS, AND UNSECURED LENDING RESPECTIVELY.  HSBC WILL ALSO TARGET WEALTHIER CUSTOMERS WHO TRAVEL OR INVEST OFTEN OVERSEAS IN MORE THAN 10 MARKETS SUCH AS CHINA WHERE ITS SHARE IS SMALLER, NUNN SAID.

THE WEALTH AND PERSONAL BANKING DIVISION COMBINED TWO OF HSBC\u2019S BETTER-PERFORMING BUSINESSES IN 2019, GROWING ADJUSTED PROFITS BY 19% AND 15% RESPECTIVELY.  CHINESE DIASPORA  AS PART OF ITS ASIA EXPANSION HSBC HAS HIRED SOME 800 FRONTLINE AND SUPPORT STAFF IN WEALTH MANAGEMENT SINCE 2017, NUNN SAID, MAINLY PRODUCT SPECIALISTS AND RELATIONSHIP MANAGERS FOR ITS PRIVATE BANK AND \u2018JADE\u2019 OFFERING FOR THOSE WITH ASSETS OF $1 MILLION-$5 MILLION.  \u201cWE REMAIN COMMITTED TO REALLY TRYING TO CAPTURE SHARE AND BE MORE RELEVANT IN THE GREATER BAY AREA OF CHINA,\u201d NUNN SAID.  IN AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE LENDER IS TARGETING THE GLOBAL CHINESE DIASPORA, HSBC HAS LAUNCHED AN INTERNATIONAL PAYMENT SYSTEM ALLOWING MAINLAND CHINESE CUSTOMERS TO PAY UNIVERSITY FEES DIRECTLY, IN RENMINBI, ACROSS 1,700 INSTITUTIONS WORLDWIDE.  HSBC INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE NOEL QUINN SAID ON TUESDAY THE BANK IS COMBINING WEALTH AND PERSONAL BANKING SO IT CAN BOOST PROFITS FROM THE TRANSFER OF PRODUCTS AND INVESTMENT BETWEEN THE TWO.  HSBC WILL AIM TO EXPAND A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST ASSET MANAGER BLACKROCK INC (BLK.N), TO USE ITS ALADDIN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE IN MORE MARKETS.  THE BANK WILL ALSO EXTEND ITS LOMBARD LENDING PRODUCT WHICH ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO BORROW AGAINST ASSETS THEY HOLD WITH THE BANK, FOR EXAMPLE TO BUY PROPERTY FOR A FAMILY MEMBER.

EXECUTIVES SAID ON FRIDAY THAT CRUDE SALES TO CHINA HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY KEY TO BRINGING PETROBRAS THROUGH THE DEMAND CRISIS CAUSED BY THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, WHILE BUNKER FUELS SALES HAD ALSO REMAINED ROBUST.  \u201cOUR COMMERCIAL TEAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPING A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH SHANDONG REFINERIES IN CHINA WHERE OUR OIL HAS STRONG DEMAND EVEN DURING THE CRISIS,\u201d CHIEF LOGISTICS OFFICER ANDR\u00c9 BARRETO CHIARINI SAID, CITING APPETITE FOR THE OUTPUT FROM FOUR SPECIFIC OFFSHORE OILFIELDS IN BRAZIL.  \u201cCRUDE OIL FROM THE LULA, IRACEMA, SAPINHOA AND BUZIOS FIELDS HAVE THE SAME OVERALL CHARACTERISTICS AS SPECIFIC CHINESE OILS ... THAT ARE EXPERIENCING DECLINING PRODUCTION,\u201d HE SAID.  HE ADDED THAT PETROBRAS HAS CAPACITY TO BOOST OIL EXPORTS 10% ABOVE THE APRIL RECORD OF 1 MILLION BPD.  IN A SIGN THAT ADHERENCE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES IS SLIPPING FROM AN ALREADY LOW BASELINE IN BRAZIL, PETROBRAS DOWNSTREAM CHIEF ANELISE LARA TOLD JOURNALISTS THAT DOMESTIC DEMAND FOR GASOLINE AND DIESEL HAD REBOUNDED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM LOWS IN EARLY APRIL.  WHILE DEMAND FOR GASOLINE HAD BEEN 65% LOWER THAN NORMAL, IT IS NOW OFF ONLY 40% TO 45%, SHE SAID. DIESEL CONSUMPTION HAD FALLEN 50%, BUT IS NOW ONLY 30% OFF NORMAL LEVELS.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS DEMAND FOR ALL PRODUCTS EXCEPT JET FUEL TO RETURN TO NEAR-NORMAL LEVELS IN THE THIRD OR FOURTH QUARTER, LARA ADDED.  EXECUTIVES ALSO SAID THEY WOULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE COMPANY\u2019S REAL ESTATE FOOTPRINT TO CUT COSTS. THE HOME OFFICE REGIME ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE PANDEMIC SHOWED THAT 50% OF OFFICE WORKERS COULD EFFECTIVELY WORK FROM HOME PERMANENTLY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE ROBERTO CASTELLO BRANCO SAID.

THE RATING OUTLOOK IS STABLE.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  CORONAVIRUS HITS VOLUMES; IMPACT SHORT-LIVED: FITCH BELIEVES THAT U.S. HEALTHCARE AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, INCLUDING PROVIDERS OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES, SHOULD BE LESS AFFECTED LONG-TERM BY CORONAVIRUS AND ITS INFLUENCE ON U.S. CONSUMERS\u2019 BEHAVIOR THAN OTHER CORPORATE SECTORS BECAUSE DEMAND IS LESS ECONOMICALLY SENSITIVE AND OFTEN TIMES IS NOT DISCRETIONARY. HOWEVER, FITCH NOTES THAT WHILE THE IMPACT FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING UHS, IS EXPECTED TO BE RELATIVELY MUTED COMPARED TO MORE DISCRETIONARY SECTORS, DEPRESSED VOLUMES OF ELECTIVE PATIENT PROCEDURES HAVE BEGUN TO MEANINGFULLY WEIGH ON REVENUE AND CASH FLOW BEGINNING IN Q220. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CANCELLED ELECTIVE PROCEDURES IN BOTH INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SETTINGS IN ORDER TO INCREASE CAPACITY FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS AND IN RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT ORDERS.  FITCH CURRENTLY BELIEVES UHS HAS SUFFICIENT HEADROOM IN THE \u2018BB+\u2019 RATING TO ABSORB THESE IMPACTS, WHICH IS PREDICATED ON AN ASSUMPTION THAT THE HEALTHCARE SERVICES SECTOR WILL EXPERIENCE A STRONG RECOVERY IN ELECTIVE PATIENT VOLUMES BEGINNING IN LATE 2020 AND INTO 2021. HOWEVER, THERE COULD BE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE RATING IF THE OUTBREAK IS OF LONGER DURATION AND IMPACTS CASH FLOW IN 2020 MORE THAN CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED (PERHAPS DUE TO PATIENT PREFERENCE TO CONTINUE TO DEFER CARE) OR THE HEALTHCARE SERVICES SEGMENT PROVES TO BE MORE ECONOMICALLY SENSITIVE THAN DURING PAST U.S. ECONOMIC RECESSIONS, LEADING TO A SLOWER RECOVERY IN ELECTIVE PATIENT VOLUMES AND PRICING IN 2021-2022.  SUSTAINABLY LOW DEBT LEVERAGE: FITCH EXPECTS UHS WILL OPERATE WITH GROSS DEBT/EBITDA AFTER NET DISTRIBUTIONS TO ASSOCIATES AND MINORITIES AROUND 3X IN 2020 AS A RESULT OF THE VOLUME DECLINES, THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE CONSIDERED CONSISTENT WITH THE \u2018BB+\u2019 IDR. THIS IS BEFORE CONSIDERATION OF GRANTS RECEIVED UNDER THE CARES ACT. AMOUNTS RECEIVED TO-DATE, SHOULD THEY BE KEPT AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS REVENUES, WOULD INCREASE EBITDA BY $239 MILLION AND REDUCE LEVERAGE TO THE MID-2X RANGE. THIS COMPARES TO LEVERAGE OF 2.1X AT DEC. 31, 2019, THE LOWEST AMONG FITCH-RATED HOSPITAL COMPANIES, DRIVEN BY MANAGEMENT\u2019S RELATIVELY MORE CONSERVATIVE BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT AND MA STRATEGY. MANAGEMENT ACKNOWLEDGED ON THE 2Q19 EARNINGS CALL THAT THE LEVERAGE PROFILE IS LOW AND \u201cPROBABLY RELATIVELY INEFFICIENT\u201d, BUT PROVIDES THE COMPANY A LARGE AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY TO RETURN CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS OR OPPORTUNISTICALLY MAKE ACQUISITIONS.  FITCH BELIEVES THAT AS A RESULT OF THAT FLEXIBILITY, EBITDA DECLINES AS A RESULT OF VOLUME REDUCTIONS DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC ARE NOT EXPECTED TO CAUSE UHS TO MEANINGFULLY AND PERSISTENTLY EXCEED ITS NEGATIVE SENSITIVITIES. FITCH ALSO BELIEVES THAT GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND THE COMPANY\u2019S PAUSE ON ITS DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY, THE COMPANY WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO ACT AGGRESSIVELY WITH RESPECT TO LEVERAGING TRANSACTIONS OR CAPITAL ALLOCATION IN THE INTERMEDIATE TERM.  DIVERSIFICATION, STABILITY FROM BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: UHS OPERATES ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS AND A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SEGMENT, WHICH PROVIDES REVENUE DIVERSIFICATION AS WELL AS IMPROVED FINANCIAL STABILITY AND PROFITABILITY. GOOD ORGANIC GROWTH, INCLUDING IN ADMISSIONS AND REVENUES, IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGITS AND STABLE PROFIT MARGINS ARE EXPECTED OVER THE RATINGS HORIZON AS THE BEHAVIORAL SEGMENT CONTINUES TO BENEFIT FROM IMPROVING PARITY BETWEEN PAYERS\u2019 COVERAGE OF CARE RELATIVE TO THE GENERAL ACUTE SEGMENT. RECENT ACQUISITIONS ARE IN LINE WITH FITCH\u2019S EXPECTATION THAT OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SEGMENT WILL BE A PRIMARY FOCUS OF CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT.  POST-PANDEMIC MARGIN HEADWINDS: FITCH EXPECTS THAT HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING UHS, WILL ADAPT OPERATIONS TO MANAGE THE BUSINESS DISRUPTION EFFECTS OF CORONAVIRUS ON OPERATIONS THROUGH INITIATIVES LIKE TELEHEALTH. THIS WILL HELP MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF LOCALIZED OUTBREAKS OF THE VIRUS ON PATIENT VOLUMES BEFORE A VACCINE OR HIGHLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS ARE AVAILABLE. THE LONGER-TERM EFFECT OF THE ECONOMIC DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC ON HEALTHCARE CONSUMERS IS LESS CERTAIN. THE SECTOR HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN FAIRLY RESILIENT, BUT NOT IMMUNE, TO THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC RECESSIONS. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TYPICALLY EXPERIENCE LOWER OPERATING MARGINS DURING AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING RECESSIONS DUE TO TREATING GREATER NUMBERS OF UNINSURED PATIENTS AND PATIENTS WITH RELATIVELY LESS PROFITABLE GOVERNMENT SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE.  FITCH ASSUMES UHS WILL CONTINUE TO PERFORM WELL IN TERMS OF VOLUMES AND COMMERCIAL PRICING, DUE IN LARGE PART TO ITS STRONG MARKET SHARES IN FAVORABLE URBAN MARKETS WHERE VOLUMES TEND TO BE WEIGHTED TOWARD A HIGHER-ACUITY PATIENT MIX. HOWEVER, UHS\u2019S MARKETS MAY EXHIBIT MORE ECONOMIC CYCLICALITY OVER TIME DUE TO THE SERVICES-ORIENTED EMPLOYMENT MARKETS IN LAS VEGAS AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THIS SOLID OPERATING PROFILE WILL HELP THE COMPANY DEFEND PROFITABILITY IN THE FACE OF WEAK ORGANIC OPERATING TRENDS, BUT PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH TO ENTIRELY OVERCOME THE EFFECTS OF CORONAVIRUS-RELATED UNEMPLOYMENT ON PATIENT MIX. FITCH EXPECTS OPERATING MARGINS FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO REBOUND SHARPLY IN 2021 FOLLOWING A 2020 TROUGH THAT REFLECTS THE PEAK PANDEMIC BUSINESS DISRUPTION, BUT TO REMAIN BELOW THE 2019 LEVEL FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  FLEXIBILITY FROM SOLID CASH FLOWS: FITCH EXPECTS FCF WILL SUSTAIN GENERALLY WITHIN $500 MILLION TO $700 MILLION PER YEAR. THESE LEVELS COMPARE WITH $712 MILLION AND $588 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  DERIVATION SUMMARY  UHS\u2019S \u2018BB+\u2019 IDR REFLECTS THE COMPANY\u2019S STRONG FINANCIAL PROFILE RESULTING FROM LOW LEVERAGE, AMPLE LIQUIDITY AND STRONG OPERATING MARGINS. THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING PROFILE IS STRONG WITH OPERATIONS FOCUSED IN URBAN AND LARGE SUBURBAN MARKETS, WHICH HAVE BETTER ORGANIC GROWTH PROSPECTS THAN RURAL AND SUBURBAN MARKETS. UHS\u2019S MARKETS MAY EXHIBIT MORE ECONOMIC CYCLICALITY THAN OTHERS. UHS IS ALSO DIVERSIFIED IN ITS REVENUE STREAM, WITH APPROXIMATELY HALF OF NET REVENUES COMING FROM ITS INPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SEGMENT. UHS\u2019S OPERATING POSITION AND LOW LEVERAGE ARE THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT DISTINGUISH ITS RATINGS FROM LOWER RATED PEERS SUCH AS TENET HEALTHCARE CORP. (B/STABLE) AND COMMUNITY HEALTH SYSTEMS (CCC). UHS IS RATED A NOTCH ABOVE HCA, INC., WHICH FITCH VIEWS AS HAVING A STRONG COMPETITIVE POSITION AND MARKET LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL OFFSET BY HIGHER LEVERAGE.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS  FITCH\u2019S KEY ASSUMPTIONS WITHIN OUR RATING CASE FOR THE ISSUER  \u2014REVENUE DECLINES BY 5.8% IN 2020 DUE TO PANDEMIC RELATED BUSINESS DISRUPTION, WITH A STEADY RECOVERY IN PATIENT VOLUMES BEGINNING IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR AND INTO 2021;  \u2014EBITDA MARGIN CONTRACTS 450 BPS IN 2020 DUE TO NEGATIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE ON PATIENT VOLUMES DECLINES AND REBOUNDS STRONGLY IN 2021 BUT REMAINS BELOW THE 2019 FITCH-CALCULATED LEVEL OF 16.5% THROUGH 2022 BECAUSE OF RECESSIONARY IMPACTS ON HEALTHCARE CONSUMERS IN THE POST-PANDEMIC PERIOD;  - FITCH\u2019S REVENUE AND EBITDA FORECAST FOR UHS DO NOT INCLUDE CARES ACT OR OTHER FISCAL STIMULUS GRANT FUNDING;  \u2014THERE IS NO NOTABLE IMPACT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH CONVERSION CYCLE;  \u2014CAPEX IS REDUCED TO 5.5% OF REVENUES IN 2020 COMMENSURATE WITH GUIDANCE, INCREASING AS A PERCENT OF REVENUE OVER THE RATINGS FORECAST. THE COMPANY HALTS SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS IN 2020-2021, RESUMING IN 2022;  \u2014FCF REMAINS AROUND $500 MILLION TO $700 MILLION.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  FACTORS THAT COULD, INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY, LEAD TO POSITIVE RATING ACTION/UPGRADE:  AN UPGRADE OF UHS\u2019S IDR TO \u2018BBB-\u2018 IS UNLIKELY IN THE NEAR TO INTERMEDIATE TERM, AS FITCH VIEWS THE RISKS AROUND REIMBURSEMENT AND OTHER REGULATORY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IN THE U.S. \u2014 AND UHS\u2019S RELIANCE ON GOVERNMENT PAYERS \u2014 AS A MATERIAL AND UNCONTROLLABLE RISK FOR UHS AND ITS PEERS;  UHS\u2019S RATINGS AND CREDIT METRICS PROVIDE IT WITH FLEXIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN HEALTHCARE PROVIDER CONSOLIDATION, WHICH FITCH EXPECTS TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE INTERMEDIATE TERM. POSITIVE MOMENTUM WOULD ALSO LIKELY REQUIRE A MORE SPECIFIC FINANCIAL POLICY.  FACTORS THAT COULD, INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY, LEAD TO NEGATIVE RATING ACTION/DOWNGRADE:  A DOWNGRADE OF UHS\u2019S IDR TO \u2018BB\u2019 COULD RESULT FROM PRESSURED MARGINS AND CASH FLOWS, OR A LARGE, LEVERAGING TRANSACTION THAT RESULTS IN TOTAL DEBT TO OPERATING EBITDA AFTER NET DISTRIBUTIONS TO MINORITIES AND ASSOCIATES EXPECTED TO BE SUSTAINED ABOVE 3.0X OR CFO AFTER CAPEX-TO-GROSS DEBT BELOW 7.5%.  THE NEGATIVE RATING SENSITIVES COULD BE TRIPPED IF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC HAS A GREATER IMPACT ON CASH FLOW THAN FITCH CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES. THERE IS STILL A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE PACE OF ACCELERATION OF CORONAVIRUS CASES ALONG WITH THE ULTIMATE LEVEL OF CORONAVIRUS PATIENT VOLUMES IN UHS\u2019S MARKETS AND THESE FACTORS WILL BE IMPORTANT TO THE TRAJECTORY OF 2020 REVENUE AND EBITDA.  BEST/WORST CASE RATING SCENARIO  INTERNATIONAL SCALE CREDIT RATINGS OF NON-FINANCIAL CORPORATE ISSUERS HAVE A BEST-CASE RATING UPGRADE SCENARIO (DEFINED AS THE 99TH PERCENTILE OF RATING TRANSITIONS, MEASURED IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION) OF THREE NOTCHES OVER A THREE-YEAR RATING HORIZON; AND A WORST-CASE RATING DOWNGRADE SCENARIO (DEFINED AS THE 99TH PERCENTILE OF RATING TRANSITIONS, MEASURED IN A NEGATIVE DIRECTION) OF FOUR NOTCHES OVER THREE YEARS. THE COMPLETE SPAN OF BEST- AND WORST-CASE SCENARIO CREDIT RATINGS FOR ALL RATING CATEGORIES RANGES FROM 'AAA' TO 'D'. BEST- AND WORST-CASE SCENARIO CREDIT RATINGS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE METHODOLOGY USED TO DETERMINE SECTOR-SPECIFIC BEST- AND WORST-CASE SCENARIO CREDIT RATINGS, VISIT HERE  LIQUIDITY AND DEBT STRUCTURE  GOOD FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY: UHS\u2019S LIQUIDITY PROFILE IS SOLID FOR THE \u2018BB+\u2019 IDR. THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT DEBT MATURITIES UNTIL 2021, WHEN THE $450 MILLION A/R SECURITIZATION ($260 MILLION OUTSTANDING AT MARCH 31, 2020) TERMINATES, WITH THE NEAREST BOND MATURITY BEING $700 MILLION OF 4.75% NOTES DUE 2022. FITCH\u2019S FORECAST ASSUMES THAT UHS WILL REFINANCE THIS DEBT. UHS DOES NOT HAVE LARGE CASH NEEDS FOR WORKING CAPITAL OR EXHIBIT MUCH SEASONALITY IN CASH FLOW GENERATION. CASH ON HAND IS TYPICALLY LOW, AROUND $50 MILLION TO $100 MILLION; THE COMPANY HAS $998 MILLION IN REVOLVING CREDIT CAPACITY AND IN RECENT PERIODS HAS MAINTAINED CLOSE TO FULL AVAILABILITY ON THIS CREDIT LINE.  UHS ALSO HAS GOOD FLEXIBILITY UNDER THE DEBT AGREEMENT COVENANTS. THE BANK AGREEMENT INCLUDES A FINANCIAL MAINTENANCE COVENANT THAT LIMITS CONSOLIDATED NET LEVERAGE TO 3.75X OR BELOW, INCREASING TO 4.25X FOR FOUR QUARTERS FOLLOWING AN ACQUISITION. AT MARCH 31, 2020, FITCH ESTIMATES THAT UHS HAS INCREMENTAL SECURED DEBT CAPACITY OF ROUGHLY $3.1 BILLION UNDER THE 3.75X CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO TEST.  DEBT ISSUE NOTCHING: FITCH DOES NOT EMPLOY A WATERFALL RECOVERY ANALYSIS FOR ISSUERS RATED \u2018BB+\u2019. THE FURTHER UP THE SPECULATIVE-GRADE CONTINUUM A RATING MOVES, THE MORE COMPRESSED THE NOTCHING BETWEEN THE SPECIFIC CLASSES OF ISSUANCES BECOMES. AS SUCH, FITCH RATES THE SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY AND SENIOR SECURED BONDS \u2018BBB-\u2018/\u2018RR1\u2019, ONE NOTCH ABOVE THE IDR. THIS RATING ILLUSTRATES FITCH\u2019S EXPECTATION FOR SUPERIOR RECOVERY PROSPECTS IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT. FURTHERMORE, FITCH BELIEVES UHS HAS GOOD FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AT THE \u2018BB+\u2019 IDR, ILLUSTRATED BY RELATIVELY LOW SECURED DEBT LEVERAGE, SUPPORTING THE ONE NOTCH UPLIFT.  REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING  THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION USED IN THE ANALYSIS ARE DESCRIBED IN THE APPLICABLE CRITERIA.  ESG CONSIDERATIONS  UNLESS OTHERWISE DISCLOSED IN THIS SECTION, THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF ESG CREDIT RELEVANCE IS A SCORE OF 3 - ESG ISSUES ARE CREDIT NEUTRAL OR HAVE ONLY A MINIMAL CREDIT IMPACT ON THE ENTITY, EITHER DUE TO THEIR NATURE OR THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ARE BEING MANAGED BY THE ENTITY.  UHS HAS AN ESG RELEVANCE SCORE OF 4 FOR EXPOSURE TO SOCIAL IMPACTS DUE TO PRESSURE TO CONTAIN HEALTHCARE SPENDING GROWTH; HIGHLY SENSITIVE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND SOCIAL PRESSURE TO CONTAIN COSTS OR RESTRICT PRICING WHICH HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE CREDIT PROFILE, AND IS RELEVANT TO THE RATING IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER FACTORS.  UHS HAS AN ESG RELEVANCE SCORE OF 4 FOR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT CONTROL THE MILLER FAMILY HAS VIA ITS OWNERSHIP AND THE RELATIVE VOTING RIGHTS OF DIFFERENT SHARE CLASSES.

THE STUDY TESTED APELLIS\u2019 PEGCETACOPLAN IN 80 PAROXYSMAL NOCTURNAL HEMOGLOBINURIA (PNH) PATIENTS WHO REMAINED ANEMIC DESPITE TAKING SOLIRIS. ABOUT HALF OF THEM WERE EVEN DEPENDANT ON BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS TO MAINTAIN OPTIMAL HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS.  THE TRIAL RESULTS WOULD HELP APELLIS CHALLENGE ALEXION\u2019S DOMINANCE IN THE PNH MARKET. ALEXION\u2019S SOLIRIS AND ULTOMIRIS, THE ONLY TWO CURRENTLY APPROVED DRUGS FOR PNH, RECORDED SALES OF $1.08 BILLION IN THE LATEST SEPTEMBER QUARTER.  PNH IS A RARE, LIFE-THREATENING DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH ABNORMALLY LOW HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS DUE TO THE DESTRUCTION OF OXYGEN-CARRYING RED BLOOD CELLS, MAKING PATIENTS DEPENDANT ON FREQUENT BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS.  ABOUT 70% OF PNH PATIENTS SHOW LOW HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS DESPITE TREATMENT WITH SOLIRIS AND 36% REQUIRE ONE OR MORE TRANSFUSIONS A YEAR, ACCORDING TO APELLIS.

LME VOLUMES BY CONTRACT: TMSNRT.RS/2UTKQU5    SHFE VOLUMES BY CONTRACT: TMSNRT.RS/2QVY54Q  BY ANDY HOME  LONDON, JAN 10 (REUTERS) - BASE METALS TRADING VOLUMES SHRANK ON ALL THREE MAJOR GLOBAL EXCHANGES LAST YEAR AS TRADE WAR UNCERTAINTY AND RANGE-BOUND MARKETS DAMPENED SPECULATIVE ACTIVITY.  \u2018DOCTOR COPPER\u2019 HAS LONG BEEN A FAVOURITE METALLIC PLAY AMONG PUNTERS AND SLIDING VOLUMES WERE SYMPTOMATIC OF A SECTOR THAT WAS LARGELY OUT OF FAVOUR WITH THE MONEY MEN.  THE LONDON METAL EXCHANGE\u2019S (LME) COPPER CONTRACT SAW ACTIVITY FALL BY 8% LAST YEAR. THE DECLINES WERE MORE PRONOUNCED ON BOTH THE CME AND SHANGHAI FUTURES EXCHANGES (SHFE) CONTRACTS WITH VOLUMES SLUMPING BY 25% AND 29% RESPECTIVELY.  ONLY NICKEL BUCKED THE BROADER TREND THANKS TO HEIGHTENED PRICE VOLATILITY AND THE METAL\u2019S ELECTRIC VEHICLE CREDENTIALS. TRADING VOLUMES ROSE BY 3% IN LONDON AND BY 40% IN SHANGHAI, WHERE NICKEL HAS ALSO ASSUMED THE ROLE OF JUNIOR PARTNER IN A PROXY TRADE WITH THE MUCH LARGER IRON ORE MARKET.  EXCHANGES CAN\u2019T DO MUCH ABOUT MANUFACTURING SLOWDOWN OR THE RESULTING RANGE-BOUND PRICING BUT THEY ARE EXPANDING THEIR PRODUCT RANGE AND OPENING UP ENTIRELY NEW MARKETS.  BASE METALS DOWNTURN  IT WAS A YEAR TO FORGET FOR MANY OF THE BASE METALS WITH COPPER, ALUMINIUM, ZINC AND LEAD CLOSING OUT 2019 LITTLE CHANGED FROM YEAR-START LEVELS.  TOTAL VOLUMES ON THE LONDON MARKET, WHICH STILL DOMINATES PHYSICAL PRICING, FELL BY 4.6% LAST YEAR AFTER A SIMILAR-SIZED RISE IN 2018.  IN TRUTH THE LME FARED SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN SUGGESTED BY THE HEADLINE FIGURE, WHICH INCLUDES SO-CALLED \u201cUNA\u201d TRADES INTRODUCED TO COMPLY WITH EUROPEAN MIFIDII REGULATIONS. STRIP THOSE OUT AND THE YEAR-ON-YEAR DECLINE WAS ONLY 1.9%.  EVEN SO, ACTIVITY ON ALL THE LME\u2019S CORE CONTRACTS FELL LAST YEAR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NICKEL, THE TOP PRICE PERFORMER AMONG THE BASE METALS IN 2019, AND TIN, THE WEAKEST PRICE PERFORMER. THE SAME TWO METALS WERE THE ONLY TWO TO REGISTER HIGHER VOLUMES IN SHANGHAI.  TIN REMAINS A TINY FUTURES MARKET BY COMPARISON WITH NICKEL BUT EVEN IT DWARFS THE LME\u2019S ALUMINIUM ALLOY CONTRACT, WHICH WITH VOLUME GROWTH OF 7% WAS THE UNLIKELY STAR PERFORMER LAST YEAR.  THAT OUTPERFORMANCE, HOWEVER, SHOULD BE SEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF FALLING ACTIVITY IN EACH OF THE PREVIOUS FOUR YEARS.  NEW PRODUCTS  THE LME LAUNCHED TWO NEW ALUMINIUM PREMIUM CONTRACTS IN MARCH LAST YEAR BUT WITH ONLY LIMITED SUCCESS. THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTRACT TRADED JUST 939 LOTS WHILE THE EUROPEAN PRODUCT FAILED TO TRADE AT ALL.  CME, WHICH LAUNCHED THE FIRST OF ITS FOUR ALUMINIUM PREMIUM CONTRACTS AS FAR BACK AS 2013, APPEARS TO HAVE CAPTURED THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE MARKET WITH TOTAL VOLUMES LAST YEAR OF 152,353 CONTRACTS.  ITS UNDERLYING ALUMINIUM CONTRACT LOOKED IN DANGER OF DISAPPEARING ALTOGETHER WITH NO TRADES AT ALL IN 2018 BUT THE CONTRACT SPRANG INTO LIFE IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2019 AFTER CME EXTENDED PHYSICAL DELIVERY TO ASIAN LOCATIONS SUCH AS SINGAPORE AND THE MALAYSIAN PORTS OF JOHOR AND PORT KLANG. THEY CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR 9,291 TONNES OF CME\u2019S TOTAL 17,145 TONNES OF REGISTERED ALUMINIUM STOCKS.  CME ZINC STOCKS HAVE SHRUNK TO JUST 6 TONNES AND THE CONTRACT, WHICH DIDN\u2019T TRADE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, LOOKS PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO FOLLOWING THE CME LEAD CONTRACT INTO OBLIVION.  VOLUMES IN THE CME\u2019S COPPER OPTIONS CONTRACT DOUBLED YEAR-ON-YEAR AND THE EXCHANGE\u2019S WEEKLY OPTIONS CONTRACTS, LAUNCHED IN 2018, STEADILY GAINED TRACTION OVER THE COURSE OF 2019.  AS DID THE SHFE COPPER OPTIONS CONTRACT, ALSO LAUNCHED IN 2018. ALMOST 8.4 MILLION LOTS TRADED IN 2019 WITH OPEN INTEREST IN DECEMBER STANDING AT 64,526 LOTS, UP 16% ON DECEMBER 2018.  MORE NEW BASE METAL PRODUCTS WERE LAUNCHED LAST YEAR BY HONG KONG EXCHANGES AND CLEARING (HKEX), THE OWNER OF THE LME.  A SUITE OF DOLLAR-DENOMINATED \u201cMINI\u201d CONTRACTS APPEAR TO BE SUCCEEDING WHERE THE YUAN-DENOMINATED OFFERING HAS LARGELY FAILED. TOTAL VOLUME WAS 29,334 CONTRACTS SINCE LAUNCH IN AUGUST, COMPARED WITH JUST 237 OVER THE WHOLE YEAR FOR THE CHINESE CURRENCY PRODUCTS.  THE NEW STEEL FRONTIER  ALL THREE EXCHANGES ARE ALSO MAKING STEADY INROADS INTO THE FERROUS SECTOR, WHICH HAS HISTORICALLY PROVED STUBBORNLY RESISTANT TO FUTURES TRADING.  THE LME\u2019S SCRAP AND REBAR CONTRACTS HAVE TRADED SINCE THE START OF 2018 AND ARE SEEING RESPECTABLE ACTIVITY. TWO NEW CONTRACTS, COVERING HOT ROLLED COIL (HRC) IN CHINA AND NORTH AMERICA, HAVE SEEN VOLUMES BUILD SINCE TRADING STARTED IN MARCH LAST YEAR. THE FORMER SET A NEW MONTHLY VOLUME RECORD OF 16,297 LOTS IN DECEMBER, BRINGING THE 2019 TOTAL TO 45,884 LOTS.  THE EXCHANGE HAS DROPPED PLENTY OF HINTS IT WILL CONSIDER BUILDING OUT ITS FERROUS PORTFOLIO FURTHER, GIVEN THE LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION IN THE CURRENT OFFERINGS.  IT\u2019S NOTICEABLE THAT THE CME\u2019S HRC CONTRACT HAS SEEN INCREASED ACTION SINCE THE LME RE-ENTERED THE STEEL SECTOR AFTER THE FAILURE OF ITS FORMER BILLET CONTRACT. CME VOLUMES GREW BY 89% IN 2018 AND BY ANOTHER 45% LAST YEAR, WHEN THE EQUIVALENT OF ALMOST 3.5 MILLION TONNES TRADED.  SHFE CURRENTLY RUNS THE HIGHEST-VOLUME GLOBAL STEEL CONTRACT. STEEL REBAR VOLUMES DROPPED 12% LAST YEAR BUT STILL TOTAL LED 930 MILLION CONTRACTS. EVEN ALLOWING FOR THE FACT THAT SHFE DOUBLE-COUNTS ITS VOLUMES, A PRACTICE THAT CHANGED AT THE START OF 2020, IT\u2019S STILL A STAGGERING FIGURE.  THE CHINESE EXCHANGE LAST YEAR EXTENDED ITS FERROUS PRODUCT RANGE WITH A NEW STAINLESS CONTRACT, WHICH TRADED 1.2 MILLION LOTS IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS.  QIANHAI SURPRISE  NOT ALL NEW PRODUCTS FLOURISH AND THE LME\u2019S NEW COBALT AND MOLYBDENUM CONTRACTS FAILED TO GET ANY TRACTION LAST YEAR.  THE LACK OF INTEREST IN THE NEW CASH-SETTLED COBALT CONTRACT IS PUZZLING, GIVEN THE STEADY DECLINE IN ACTIVITY IN THE OLDER PHYSICALLY DELIVERABLE CONTRACT, WHICH SAW VOLUMES SLUMP BY 26% LAST YEAR. IT\u2019S NOT AS IF COBALT HASN\u2019T BEEN VOLATILE OR THAT CARMAKERS HAVEN\u2019T EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR A WAY OF HEDGING A KEY INPUT INTO ELECTRIC BATTERIES.  ALSO STRANGE IS THE LACK OF TRACTION GAINED BY EITHER THE CME OR LME ALUMINA CONTRACTS, GIVEN THE SECTOR HAS SWITCHED TOWARDS SPOT PRICING.  CME ALUMINA VOLUMES FELL BY 79% LAST YEAR TO 118,200 TONNES, WHILE THE LME\u2019S NEW ALUMINA CONTRACT NOTCHED UP TRADES OF JUST 46,000 TONNES.  BOTH WERE ECLIPSED BY THE 374,011 TONNES TRADED ON THE QIANHAI MERCANTILE EXCHANGE, HKEX\u2019S FORAY INTO MAINLAND CHINA.  THE QME IS SOMETHING OF AN ANOMALY IN THE GLOBAL METALS EXCHANGE WORLD. BARRED FROM OFFERING FUTURES PRODUCTS IN MAINLAND CHINA, HKEX HAS BEEN BUILDING OUT A PHYSICAL EXCHANGE.  ALUMINA WAS ONE OF FIVE METALLIC OFFERINGS LAUNCHED LAST YEAR. THE OTHERS ARE COPPER CATHODE, COPPER ROD, ALUMINIUM INGOT AND ALUMINIUM BILLET.  IT\u2019S TAKEN SEVERAL YEARS FOR HKEX TO GET THE QME UP AND RUNNING BUT IT IS WORTH WATCHING BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS A CLEAR CHALLENGE TO THE CHINESE INCUMBENT IN SHANGHAI.  THE BIG THREE EXCHANGES CURRENTLY CO-EXIST IN A RELATIVELY PEACEFUL ORDER. WHAT THE CHINESE LIKE TO CALL A \u201cWIN-WIN\u201d SCENARIO MAY NOT LAST LONG IF QME PICKS UP TRADING MOMENTUM.", "Ticker": "CME", "Date": "2020-01-10T00:00:00", "key": "20200110CME", "labelr0": -1.6213364033194202, "labelr1": -0.4632112730996231, "labelr2": -0.2841187420397689, "labelr3": 0.7123206916879488, "labelr4": 1.0438515194380835, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.191, "compound": -0.3818, "0_day_return": -1.6213364033194178, "1_day_return": -1.6213364033194178, "2_day_return": -0.7460139450972902, "3_day_return": -0.03900726510315256, "4_day_return": 1.0044370764054733, "label": -1, "return": 0.0069762152039844535, "excess_return": -1.6283126185234025, "count_of_word": 1151, "pred": -1, "prof-1": 0.73361224, "prof1": 0.26638779999999995, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5029548857287194, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4970451142712806, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.73361224, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.26638779999999995, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.63761914, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.3623808, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5171162, "tr_prof1": 0.48288387, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.43608168, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.5639183000000001, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5931922, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.40680778, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.31144327, "headline_prof21": 0.68855673, "textplusheadline_pred": -1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.55452156, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.44547844, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.4296634, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.57033664, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.5086893, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.49131066, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 1.6213364033194178, "returnpredvader": 1.6213364033194178, "returnpredsgd": 1.6213364033194178, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.021794873069486, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9792097771651261, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9742713978914732, "cumreturn1b": 1.0876292624244528, "cumreturn1d": 0.9669140449142556, "cumreturn1e": 1.0111377218393396, "cumreturndow": 1.0092944070749572, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0013249597823675}, {"Unnamed: 0": 16921, "Unnamed: 0.1": 16921, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 16921, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 16921, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 16921, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 16921, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16921, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16921, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16921, "level_0": 16921, "index": 16921, "text": "JAN 14 (REUTERS) - BHP GROUP SAID ON TUESDAY LINDSAY MAXSTED WILL NOT STAND FOR RE-ELECTION AS A DIRECTOR, MONTHS AFTER HE BROUGHT FORWARD HIS RETIREMENT AS CHAIRMAN OF WESTPAC BANKING CORP AFTER A MONEY-LAUNDERING SCANDAL ROCKED THE LENDER.

REUTERS/MIKE BLAKE/FILE PHOTO  KALVARIA ALSO TOLD THE REUTERS GLOBAL MARKETS FORUM ON THURSDAY THAT CITI\u2019S OVERALL MARKET SHARE ACROSS ADVISORY, SYNDICATE LENDING, EQUITY AND DEBT ORIGINATION ROSE IN 2019, BUT ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TALENT IS CHALLENGING IN THE BUSINESS.  BELOW ARE EXCERPTS FROM THE CHAT, HELD ON THE SIDELINES OF THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM\u2019S ANNUAL MEETING IN DAVOS, SWITZERLAND:  QUESTION (Q) - IS GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY KEEPING SOME CORPORATE CLIENTS, WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOOKING FOR DEALS OR OTHER FINANCING, ON THE SIDELINES?  ANSWER (A) - I DON\u2019T THINK GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES ARE AFFECTING CLIENTS WHO ARE LOOKING TO DO STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS. HOWEVER, THAT SAID, OBVIOUSLY OUTBOUND MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS (M&A) FROM CHINA HAS GONE DOWN CONSIDERABLY, BUT OTHER CROSS BORDER M&A REMAINS REASONABLY STRONG.  Q - MANY OF CITIGROUP\u2019S COMPETITORS ARE GOING DOWN MARKET TO LOOK FOR GROWTH SINCE THERE IS MORE COMPETITION FOR THE BIGGEST DEALS BUT FEWER OF THEM. WHY HASN\u2019T CITI FOLLOWED SUIT?  A - WE ARE NOT GOING DOWN MARKET BECAUSE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT\u2019S THE RIGHT PHRASEOLOGY. WHAT WE ARE DOING IS SPENDING SIGNIFICANT TIME ON SMALLER EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE, OVER TIME, WILL BE WINNERS WITHIN THEIR SUB-SECTORS.  THOSE COMPANIES ARE CANDIDATES FOR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, MERGER AND ACQUISITION (M&A) OPPORTUNITIES AND OTHER POTENTIAL SERVICES THAT WE CAN BRING TO BEAR AS THEY GROW GLOBALLY.  Q - HOW HAS THE ERA OF \u201cUNICORNS\u201d CHANGED THE WAY CITIGROUP SOURCES NEW CLIENTS?  A - THE ERA OF UNICORNS RELATES TO THE EARLIER QUESTION ABOUT COVERING SMALLER COMPANIES. THE UNICORN VALUATIONS HELP HIGHLIGHT COMPANIES WITH GREAT POTENTIAL FOR US TO COVER AND ARE VERY HELPFUL IN THE AREAS WE SHOULD INVEST IN FROM THE PEOPLE STANDPOINT.  Q - IN 2018, CITI\u2019S OVERALL MARKET SHARE ACROSS ADVISORY, SYNDICATE LENDING AND EQUITY AND DEBT ORIGINATION ROSE TO 5.1%, FROM 4.9%. HOW IS THE EFFORT TO CAPTURE MORE MARKET SHARE PROGRESSING AND WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST HURDLES?  A - WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE IN 2019 SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY. THE HURDLES REMAIN IN RETAINING AND ATTRACTING THE BEST TALENT. THIS IS A PEOPLE BUSINESS AND WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST.  Q - HOW WILL THE CORPORATE BANKING LANDSCAPE CHANGE, GIVEN RECENT CONSOLIDATION IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS INDUSTRY. WILL FEWER PLAYERS IN EQUITY OR DEBT IMPACT THE OTHER CORPORATE BANKING BUSINESS LINES?  A - CORPORATE BANKING BUSINESS WILL REMAIN A BROAD GLOBAL BUSINESS. OBVIOUSLY THE BIG 3 AMERICAN CORPORATE BANKS CONTINUE TO ENJOY A VERY STRONG POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND REMAIN VERY STRONG. BUT THEY (FACE) COMPETITION FROM LEADING BANKS IN ASIA AND EUROPE.  IN TERMS OF FIXED INCOME AND EQUITIES, SOME PLAYERS HAVE RETREATED TO SOME EXTENT AND THAT HAS GIVEN OTHER PLAYERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PICK UP MARKET SHARE.

REUTERS/ALESSANDRO BIANCHI/FILE PHOTO  SPEAKING ON RADIO 24, DEPUTY TRANSPORT MINISTER GIANCARLO CANCELLERI, FROM THE 5-STAR MOVEMENT THAT HAS LED CALLS FOR ATLANTIA TO BE STRIPPED OF ITS CONCESSION, ACKNOWLEDGED THE GOVERNMENT COULD DECIDE NOT TO REVOKE THE LICENSE.

ATLANTIA HAS BEEN UNDER PRESSURE SINCE AUGUST 2018 WHEN A BRIDGE OPERATED BY ITS MOTORWAY UNIT AUTOSTRADE PER L\u2019ITALIA COLLAPSED IN THE PORT CITY OF GENOA, KILLING 43 PEOPLE.

REUTERS/RASHID UMAR ABBASI/FILE PHOTO  THE $60 MILLION SETTLEMENT COMES AS A 10-DAY TRIAL IS SCHEDULED TO START ON MARCH 16 IN DELAWARE IN WHICH SHAREHOLDERS SEEK $2.6 BILLION IN DAMAGES, THE ENTIRE COST OF THE SOLARCITY DEAL.  A LAWYER FOR MUSK AND A SPOKESMAN FOR TESLA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT.  TESLA SHAREHOLDERS HAVE ALLEGED MUSK BREACHED HIS FIDUCIARY DUTIES, SQUANDERED TESLA\u2019S ASSETS AND UNJUSTLY ENRICHED HIMSELF BY PUSHING TO BUY THE MONEY-LOSING SOLAR COMPANY IN WHICH HE WAS THE BIGGEST INVESTOR.  THE SETTLEMENT COVERED FIVE CURRENT DIRECTORS: ROBYN DENHOLM, IRA EHRENPREIS, ANTONIO GRACIAS, STEPHEN JURVETSON AND KIMBAL MUSK. BRAD BUSS, WHO WAS A DIRECTOR AT THE TIME OF THE SOLARCITY DEAL, WAS ALSO PART OF THE SETTLEMENT, WHICH WAS PAID FROM INSURANCE POLICIES, ACCORDING TO COURT DOCUMENTS.  \u201cPLAINTIFFS PROBABLY THINK THEY HAVE A CLEANER SHOT ON THE MERITS IF THE ONLY ISSUES THEY HAVE TO RAISE ARE WITH ELON MUSK AND ELON MUSK\u2019S ACTIONS,\u201d SAID BRIAN QUINN, A PROFESSOR AT BOSTON COLLEGE LAW SCHOOL.  THE CASE WAS BROUGHT IN THE COURT OF CHANCERY IN DELAWARE, WHERE TESLA IS INCORPORATED, BY AN INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR AND FIVE INVESTMENT FUNDS.  TESLA SAID IN A STATEMENT TO REUTERS IN SEPTEMBER THE ALLEGATIONS WERE \u201cBASED ON THE CLAIMS OF PLAINTIFF\u2019S LAWYERS LOOKING FOR A PAYDAY, AND ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS.\u201d  THE SUIT REPRESENTS ANOTHER LEGAL HEADACHE FOR MUSK, WHO IN THE PAST TWO YEARS HAS SETTLED A LAWSUIT BY SECURITIES REGULATORS OVER HIS USE OF TWITTER AND WON A DEFAMATION TRIAL BROUGHT BY A BRITISH CAVE EXPLORER.  MUSK AND THE TESLA BOARD ALSO ARE SCHEDULED TO DEFEND MUSK\u2019S PAY PACKAGE AT A TRIAL IN DELAWARE NEXT YEAR.  AT THE HEART OF THE CURRENT CASE ARE ALLEGATIONS THAT MUSK AND THE OTHER BOARD MEMBERS DID NOT FULLY DISCLOSE THE DEPTH OF SOLARCITY\u2019S PROBLEMS, OR THEIR OWN CONFLICTS.  SOLARCITY WAS FOUNDED IN 2006 BY MUSK AND HIS COUSINS, LYNDON RIVE AND PETER RIVE, WHO WERE THE COMPANY\u2019S CEO AND CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER AS WELL AS DIRECTORS. MUSK WAS SOLARCITY\u2019S CHAIRMAN AND LARGEST SHAREHOLDER, AND FIVE OF TESLA\u2019S DIRECTORS WERE DIRECT OR INDIRECT OWNERS OF SOLARCITY STOCK.  ENTERING 2016, SOLARCITY\u2019S STOCK WAS ON A SHARP DOWNWARD TRAJECTORY AND THE COMPANY WAS SLASHING ITS WORKFORCE AND BLEEDING CASH.  TESLA TOUTED SYNERGIES OF COMBINING THE COMPANIES IN THE ALL-STOCK DEAL, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY TESLA SHAREHOLDERS.  AFTER THE DEAL CLOSED, TESLA SLASHED ITS SOLAR SALES FORCE AND ENDED A SOLAR MARKETING DEAL WITH HOME DEPOT INC. QUARTERLY SOLAR INSTALLATIONS PLUMMETED AND ARE WELL BELOW LEVELS SOLARCITY ENJOYED IN ITS HEYDAY.  TESLA HAS SAID MUSK\u2019S INVOLVEMENT IN DEAL DISCUSSIONS AND ALL OTHER MATERIAL INFORMATION WERE ACCURATELY DESCRIBED TO SHAREHOLDERS IN PUBLIC FILINGS BEFORE THE DEAL CLOSED.
