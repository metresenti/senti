<p>**Backtest:</p>
<p>We use a long-short equally-weighted portfolio backtest for all our models. Other papers are tended to use the top 10 long predictions and top 10 short predictions to build a portfolio but we prefer to include all predictions in our portfolio. We assume that we are able to buy at market open and liquidate at market close. 
Our backtest does not incorporate:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use of options/derivatives</p>
</li>
<li><p>Self-financing portfolios</p>
</li>
<li><p>Leverage</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optimal sizing of trades: all positiona are the same size</p>
</li>
<li><p>Transaction costs</p>
</li>
<li><p>Slippage</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>**Proof-of-Concept 1: Reuters dataset 1 2017-2020</p>
<p>Data is segmented into training data (2017-2018) and test data (2019-2020). Preprocessing of the text data for text normalization, stemming, lemmatization and extraction of stop words.</p>
<p>**Single Stock</p>
<p>We segment the data for the stock ticker with the highest occurence - BA Boeing</p>
<p>*Model accuracy on the validation dataset:</p>

<pre><code>NTLK VADER Sentiment Analyzer - N/A

Linear Classifier - 53%

Sentimetre Model 1 - 53%

Sentimetre Model 2 - 57%

IN JULY, EMBRAER AGREED TO SELL 80 PERCENT OF ITS COMMERCIAL PLANE DIVISION TO BOEING FOR $4.2 BILLION, AS GLOBAL COMPETITION ESCALATED BETWEEN THE U.S. PLANEMAKER AND AIRBUS. THE DEAL HAS BEEN APPROVED BY EMBRAER\u2019S BOARD AND THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT BUT HAS YET TO BE PUT TO A VOTE BY ITS SHAREHOLDERS.  EMBRAER\u2019S BYLAWS ENSURE AN OFFER TO ALL SHAREHOLDERS WITH A 50 PERCENT PREMIUM OVER MARKET PRICES IF AN INVESTOR BUYS 35 PERCENT OR MORE OF THE COMPANY.  IF THE DEAL GOES THROUGH, EMBRAER WILL HAVE TO ATTEMPT TO BE PROFITABLE FROM ITS EXECUTIVE AND DEFENSE DIVISIONS WHICH HAVE POSTED LOSSES IN RECENT YEARS, AS WELL AS FROM DIVIDENDS IT WILL RECEIVE FROM ITS REMAINING STAKE IN ITS COMMERCIAL DIVISION.  \u201cWHAT WILL BE LEFT BEHIND WITH EMBRAER WILL NOT SURVIVE IN THE MEDIUM TERM WITHOUT HEAVY GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES,\u201d SAID AURELIO VALPORTO, PRESIDENT OF ABRADIN.  EMBRAER DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE MATTER.  THE BRAZILIAN PLANEMAKER SAID THIS MONTH IT EXPECTED TO POST LITTLE TO NO PROFIT OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS.  THE PROPOSED BOEING-EMBRAER DEAL FACES CHALLENGES ON MULTIPLE FRONTS, INCLUDING FROM LEFT-WING POLITICIANS AND LABOR GROUPS WHO SAY THE TIE-UP WOULD LEAD TO JOB CUTS. THE DEAL HAS BEEN TEMPORARILY BLOCKED BY BRAZILIAN JUDGES AT LEAST TWICE THROUGH INJUNCTIONS, BOTH OF WHICH WERE SWIFTLY REVERSED.", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2019-01-22T00:00:00", "key": "20190122BA", "labelr0": -1.87261810106107, "labelr1": 0.1983794355965455, "labelr2": -0.0948105183904609, "labelr3": 1.6551762637117278, "labelr4": -0.33772652388796304, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.192, "compound": -0.2263, "0_day_return": -1.8726181010610743, "1_day_return": -1.8726181010610743, "2_day_return": 0.103380832634814, "3_day_return": 1.7602682313495377, "4_day_return": 1.4165968147527463, "label": -1, "return": 0.002202912839790878, "excess_return": -1.8748210139008648, "count_of_word": 332, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.52149385, "prof1": 0.47850618, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5103887760523331, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4896112239476669, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.52149385, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.47850618, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.4358292, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.56417084, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.4879443, "tr_prof1": 0.51205564, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5081649, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.49183512, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.45060307, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.54939693, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.3891413, "headline_prof21": 0.6108587, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.46565619999999996, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.53434384, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.5946094, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.40539053, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.7632355, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.23676449, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -1.8726181010610743, "returnpredvader": 1.8726181010610743, "returnpredsgd": 1.8726181010610743, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9812738189893893, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0187261810106107, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0187261810106107, "cumreturn1b": 1.0383872431992243, "cumreturn1d": 0.9606578528041946, "cumreturn1e": 1.0528071286675684, "cumreturndow": 1.0421653011081435, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0487539442992062}, {"Unnamed: 0": 848, "Unnamed: 0.1": 848, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 848, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 848, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 848, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 848, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 848, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 848, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 848, "level_0": 848, "index": 848, "text": "(CORRECTING TIME ELEMENT IN REFERENCE TO TEST FLIGHT, WHICH TOOK PLACE ON TUESDAY)  BY ERIC M.

BOEING IS COMPETING WITH ARCH-RIVAL AIRBUS SE AND NUMEROUS OTHER FIRMS TO INTRODUCE SMALL SELF-FLYING VEHICLES CAPABLE OF VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND LANDING.  THE INVESTMENTS, FUELED BY LEAPS IN AUTONOMOUS TECHNOLOGY AS MUCH AS FRUSTRATION WITH ROAD CONGESTION, COULD CHANGE THE FACE OF THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE.  BOEING\u2019S 30-FOOT-LONG (9 METER) AIRCRAFT - PART HELICOPTER, PART DRONE AND PART FIXED-WING PLANE - LIFTED A FEW FEET OFF THE GROUND AND MADE A SOFT LANDING AFTER LESS THAN A MINUTE OF BEING AIRBORNE ON TUESDAY AT AN AIRPORT IN MANASSAS, VIRGINIA, BOEING SAID.  FUTURE FLIGHTS WILL TEST FORWARD, WING-BORNE FLIGHT.  \u201cTHIS IS WHAT REVOLUTION LOOKS LIKE, AND IT\u2019S BECAUSE OF AUTONOMY,\u201d JOHN LANGFORD, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF BOEING SUBSIDIARY AURORA FLIGHT SCIENCES, SAID IN A NEWS RELEASE ANNOUNCING THE TEST FLIGHT.  MAJOR HURDLES TO BOEING\u2019S VISION OF \u201cLOW-STRESS\u201d MOBILITY - AS IT IS CALLED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S MARKETING MATERIALS - INCLUDE SORTING OUT NUMEROUS CRITICAL SAFETY AND REGULATORY ISSUES TO MELD TRADITIONAL ROADWAY TRAFFIC WITH FLEETS OF FLYING CARS.  BOEING IS WORKING WITH STARTUP SPARKCOGNITION INC AND THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP A TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THREE-DIMENSIONAL HIGHWAYS, AS WELL AS THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT WILL ALLOW WAVES OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES TO ZIP SAFELY AROUND BUILDINGS, THE COMPANY HAS SAID.  BOEING BOUGHT MANASSAS-BASED AURORA FLIGHT SCIENCES LAST YEAR TO SPEED DEVELOPMENT OF A FLEET OF AUTONOMOUS AIR VEHICLES. WITH AURORA, BOEING IS ALSO WORKING ON UBER TECHNOLOGIES INC\u2019S UBERAIR SERVICE FOR FLIGHTS THAT ARE PLANNED TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ORDER VIA SMARTPHONES AROUND 2023.  BOEING IS LOOKING TO ACHIEVE A RANGE OF 50 MILES WITH TWO FLYING CAR VARIANTS CAPABLE OF CARRYING TWO AND FOUR PASSENGERS EACH. TESTS ARE PLANNED FOR LATER THIS YEAR ON A PACKAGE-HAULING VERSION THAT CAN LIFT UP TO 500 POUNDS (226.8 KG).  COMPETITORS RANGE FROM AIRBUS TO VOLOCOPTER, WHICH HAS TESTED DRONE TAXIS THAT RESEMBLE A SMALL HELICOPTER POWERED BY 18 ROTORS, AND AEROMOBIL, WITH A STRETCH-LIMOUSINE CONCEPT THAT CAN TURN INTO A FIXED-WING AIRCRAFT.  VERTICAL AEROSPACE, WHICH COMPLETED A FLIGHT TEST LAST YEAR, AIMS TO OFFER SHORT INTER-CITY FLIGHTS IN THE COMING YEARS WITH A PILOTED AIRCRAFT CAPABLE OF CARRYING MULTIPLE PASSENGERS.

REUTERS/JASON REDMOND/FILE PHOTO  THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST PLANEMAKER SAID IT EXPECTS TO DELIVER BETWEEN 895 AND 905 COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IN 2019, UP FROM 806 AIRCRAFT IT DELIVERED LAST YEAR, WHICH - ALTHOUGH JUST BELOW COMPANY TARGETS - KEPT IT AHEAD OF ARCH-RIVAL AIRBUS SE FOR A SEVENTH YEAR.  INVESTORS CLOSELY WATCH THE NUMBER OF PLANES BOEING TURNS OVER TO AIRLINES AND LEASING FIRMS IN A YEAR FOR HINTS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH FLOW AND REVENUE.  DESPITE ITS ROSY OUTLOOK, AMERICA\u2019S BIGGEST EXPORTER FACES POSSIBLE TURBULENCE ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS IN 2019, INCLUDING FINANCIAL STRESS FELT BY SOME OF ITS AIRLINE CUSTOMERS, SIGNS OF A BROADER ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND U.S. TRADE TENSIONS WITH CHINA, WHERE BOEING SHIPS ABOUT 1 OUT OF 4 AIRCRAFT THAT IT MAKES.  THERE ARE ALSO UNANSWERED QUESTIONS RELATED TO THE DEADLY CRASH OF A LION AIR 737 MAX IN INDONESIA IN OCTOBER THAT THRUST A SPOTLIGHT ON THE NEWEST VERSION OF THE BEST-SELLING JET, AS WELL AS ON AIRLINE TRAINING AND MAINTENANCE.  BOEING CHIEF EXECUTIVE DENNIS MUILENBURG TOLD ANALYSTS DURING A CONFERENCE CALL THAT HE SAW PROGRESS IN FRESH U.S.-CHINA TRADE TALKS AND SEPARATELY SAID AIRCRAFT ORDERS WOULD BE \u201cMODERATED\u201d BUT HEALTHY IN 2019, ALTHOUGH DELIVERIES DROPPED IN JANUARY.  MUILENBURG SAID BOEING WOULD MAKE A FINAL LAUNCH DECISION IN 2020 ON A PROPOSED NEW MID SIZED JETLINER, AIMED AT A NICHE MARKET FALLING BETWEEN NARROW- AND WIDE-BODY AIRCRAFT, DEPENDING ON THE RESULTS OF A ROUND OF COMMERCIAL PRE-MARKETING WHICH IT MAY BEGIN THIS YEAR. HE HAD PREVIOUSLY SPOKEN OF A LAUNCH DECISION IN 2019.  THE DECISION ON WHETHER TO LAUNCH THE NEW JET, KNOWN AS NMA, IS EXPECTED TO RESHAPE COMPETITION WITH AIRBUS, WHICH DOMINATES THE TOP END OF THE MEDIUM-HAUL SECTOR.  MUILENBURG SAID BOEING STARTED RUNNING 787 DREAMLINER ASSEMBLY LINES AT A RATE READY TO SUPPORT HIGHER OUTPUT OF 14 JETS A MONTH, CONFIRMING AN EARLIER REUTERS REPORT, BRINGING IT WITHIN REACH OF A CLOSELY-WATCHED GOAL DESIGNED TO BOOST CASH AND REDUCE COSTS.  THE 787 TRANSITION TO 14 PER MONTH WILL BE COMPLETED BY THE SECOND QUARTER, MUILENBURG SAID.  CHICAGO-BASED BOEING SAID ITS QUARTERLY OPERATING MARGIN ON COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT INCREASED TO 15.6 PERCENT FROM 11.6 PERCENT FROM A YEAR AGO, DRIVEN BY HIGHER 737 PRODUCTION AND HIGHER MARGINS ON ITS DREAMLINER.  BOEING\u2019S UPBEAT FORECASTS AND FULL-YEAR 2018 RESULTS - WHICH INCLUDED SURPASSING THE $100 BILLION REVENUE MARK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ITS 102-YEAR HISTORY - BOOSTED SHARES NEARLY 7 PERCENT TO $388.64, HELPING BOOST THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE.  737 ENGINE DELAYS  DESPITE FASTER PRODUCTION, BOEING SAID IT WAS STILL MUSCLING THROUGH DELAYS ON ENGINES SUPPLIED BY CFM INTERNATIONAL - THE TRANS-ATLANTIC VENTURE BETWEEN GENERAL ELECTRIC AND SAFRAN, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO A MAJOR BOTTLENECK AT THE SEATTLE-AREA 737 FACTORY LAST YEAR.  RELATED PRODUCTION PROBLEMS DRAGGED DOWN QUARTERLY FREE CASH FLOW TO $2.45 BILLION, BELOW THE PREVIOUS YEAR, BOEING SAID.  \u201cWE ARE DEPLOYING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WITH THEM INTO THEIR FACTORIES AND SUPPLY CHAIN,\u201d MUILENBURG SAID REGARDING CFM. \u201cWE DO EXPECT TO RECOVER, WE\u2019RE SEEING SIGNS OF RECOVERY, BUT WE STILL HAVE WORK TO GO.\u201d  A CHUNK OF THE EARNINGS CALL TURNED TO NEWER AIRCRAFT, WITH MUILENBURG TELLING ANALYSTS THE FIRST ALL-NEW 777X WIDEBODY TEST AIRPLANE COMPLETED FINAL BODY JOIN AND POWER-ON AHEAD OF FLIGHT TESTS LATER THIS YEAR. THE PROGRAM REMAINS ON TRACK FOR FIRST DELIVERY IN 2020, HE SAID.  BOEING ALSO RAISED ITS FULL-YEAR CORE EARNINGS PER SHARE FORECAST TO $19.90-$20.10 FROM $14.90-$15.10, AND REVENUE TO A RANGE OF $109.5 BILLION TO $111.5 BILLION, FROM $98 BILLION TO $100 BILLION, FUELED BY STRONG VOLUME ACROSS ITS COMMERCIAL, MILITARY AND SERVICES BUSINESSES.

THE EXTRA FIVE PLANES A MONTH IS KEY TO BOEING\u2019S EFFORT TO RAISE PROFIT MARGINS ON ITS TOP-SELLING JETLINER, WHICH CAN CARRY A LIST PRICE RANGING FROM AROUND $85.8 MILLION TO $129.9 MILLION AND ARE THE COMPANY\u2019S LARGEST SOURCE OF PROFIT. THE MORE PLANES BOEING MAKES A MONTH, THE LESS IT USUALLY PAYS SUPPLIERS FOR THE PARTS.  IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME FOR NEW JETLINERS TO WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH FINAL TESTING AND DELIVERY, WHEN AN AIRLINE HANDS OVER THE BULK OF THE MONEY FOR A PLANE IT ORDERED.

IT IS AUSTRALIA\u2019S FIRST DOMESTICALLY DEVELOPED COMBAT AIRCRAFT IN DECADES AND BOEING\u2019S BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN UNMANNED SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DECLINED TO SPECIFY THE DOLLAR AMOUNT.

ATLANTA-BASED DELTA\u2019S POTENTIAL FLEET ORDER, WHICH ANALYSTS SAY WOULD BE WORTH OVER $10 BILLION, COULD BOOST PROPOSALS BY BOEING CO TO LAUNCH A NEW PLANE IN THAT SEGMENT WHILE AIRBUS IS PREPARING TO COUNTER WITH A NEW VERSION OF A321 AND THE LARGER A330NEO.

ITALY\u2019S STATE-CONTROLLED RAILWAY FERROVIE DELLO STATO (FS) SAID LAST MONTH IT WOULD START NEGOTIATIONS WITH DELTA AND EASYJET PLC TO DRAFT A RESCUE PLAN, THE THIRD IN A DECADE, FOR THE STRUGGLING AIRLINE.

BOEING SAID IT HAD PAUSED DELIVERIES OF ITS FASTEST-SELLING 737 MAX AIRCRAFT BUILT AT ITS FACTORY NEAR SEATTLE BUT CONTINUES TO PRODUCE ITS SINGLE-AISLE JETS AT FULL SPEED WHILE DEALING WITH THE WORLDWIDE FLEET\u2019S GROUNDING.  INVESTIGATORS IN FRANCE WILL BE SEEKING CLUES INTO SUNDAY\u2019S DEADLY ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH AFTER TAKE-OFF FROM ADDIS ABABA KILLED 157 PEOPLE FROM 35 NATIONS IN THE SECOND SUCH CALAMITY INVOLVING BOEING\u2019S PLANE SINCE OCTOBER.  POSSIBLE LINKS BETWEEN THE ACCIDENTS HAVE ROCKED THE AVIATION INDUSTRY, SCARED PASSENGERS, AND LEFT THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST PLANEMAKER SCRAMBLING TO PROVE THE SAFETY OF A MONEY-SPINNING MODEL INTENDED TO BE THE STANDARD FOR DECADES.  U.S. REPRESENTATIVE RICK LARSEN SAID AFTER A BRIEFING WITH U.S. AVIATION OFFICIALS THE SOFTWARE UPGRADE WOULD TAKE A FEW WEEKS TO COMPLETE, AND INSTALLING IT ON ALL AIRCRAFT WOULD TAKE \u201cAT LEAST THROUGH APRIL.\u201d HE SAID ADDITIONAL TRAINING WOULD ALSO HAVE TO TAKE PLACE.  BOEING HAS SAID IT WOULD ROLL OUT THE SOFTWARE IMPROVEMENT \u201cACROSS THE 737 MAX FLEET IN THE COMING WEEKS.\u201d  RELATIVES OF THE DEAD STORMED OUT OF A MEETING WITH ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES ON THURSDAY, DECRYING A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY, WHILE OTHERS MADE THE PAINFUL TRIP TO THE CRASH SCENE.  \u201cI CAN\u2019T FIND YOU! WHERE ARE YOU?\u201d SAID ONE ETHIOPIAN WOMAN, DRAPED IN TRADITIONAL WHITE MOURNING SHAWL, AS SHE HELD A FRAMED PORTRAIT OF HER BROTHER IN THE CHARRED AND DEBRIS-STREWN FIELD.  AFTER AN APPARENT TUSSLE OVER WHERE THE INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE HELD, THE FLIGHT DATA AND COCKPIT VOICE RECORDERS WERE HANDED OVER TO FRANCE\u2019S BUREAU OF ENQUIRY AND ANALYSIS FOR CIVIL AVIATION SAFETY (BEA).  TECHNICAL ANALYSIS WOULD BEGIN ON FRIDAY AND THE FIRST CONCLUSIONS COULD TAKE SEVERAL DAYS, THE BEA SAID, POSTING A PICTURE OF THE PARTLY CRUMPLED, ORANGE-CASED BOX.  NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING AN INITIALLY RELUCTANT UNITED STATES, HAVE SUSPENDED THE 371 MAX MODELS IN OPERATION, THOUGH AIRLINES ARE LARGELY COPING BY SWITCHING PLANES.  NEARLY 5,000 MAXS ARE ON ORDER, MEANING THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS ARE HUGE FOR THE INDUSTRY. MOODY\u2019S RATING AGENCY SAID THE FALLOUT FROM THE CRASH WOULD NOT IMMEDIATELY AFFECT BOEING\u2019S CREDIT RATING.  \u201cWE CONTINUE TO BUILD 737 MAX AIRPLANES WHILE ASSESSING HOW THE SITUATION, INCLUDING POTENTIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, WILL IMPACT OUR PRODUCTION SYSTEM,\u201d BOEING SPOKESMAN CHAZ BICKERS SAID.  BOEING WOULD MAINTAIN ITS PRODUCTION RATE OF 52 AIRCRAFT PER MONTH, AND ITS NEWEST VERSION, THE MAX, REPRESENTS THE LION\u2019S SHARE, ALTHOUGH BOEING DECLINED TO BREAK OUT EXACT NUMBERS.  CONNECTION TO INDONESIA CRASH?  THE INVESTIGATION OF SUNDAY\u2019S CRASH HAS ADDED URGENCY SINCE THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) ON WEDNESDAY GROUNDED THE 737 MAX AIRCRAFT, CITING SATELLITE DATA AND EVIDENCE FROM THE SCENE THAT INDICATED SOME SIMILARITIES AND \u201cTHE POSSIBILITY OF A SHARED CAUSE\u201d WITH OCTOBER\u2019S CRASH IN INDONESIA THAT KILLED 189 PEOPLE.

REUTERS/BAZ RATNER/FILE PHOTO  THOUGH IT MAINTAINS THE PLANES ARE SAFE, BOEING HAS SUPPORTED THE FAA MOVE. ITS STOCK IS DOWN ABOUT 11 PERCENT SINCE THE CRASH, WIPING MORE THAN $26 BILLION OFF ITS MARKET VALUE. IT FELL 1 PERCENT ON THURSDAY.  U.S. AND CANADIAN CARRIERS WRESTLED WITH CUSTOMER CALLS AND FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS AND SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO AND AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC, THE LARGEST U.S. OPERATORS OF THE 737 MAX, SAID THEY HAD STARTED FLYING EMPTY MAX AIRCRAFT TO BE PARKED ELSEWHERE DURING THE BAN.  U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, AN AVIATION ENTHUSIAST WITH DEEP TIES TO BOEING, SAID HE HOPED THE SUSPENSIONS WOULD BE SHORT. \u201cTHEY HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT FAST,\u201d TRUMP TOLD REPORTERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE.  A SOFTWARE FIX FOR THE 737 MAX THAT BOEING HAS BEEN WORKING ON SINCE THE LION AIR CRASH IN OCTOBER IN INDONESIA WILL TAKE MONTHS TO COMPLETE, THE FAA SAID ON WEDNESDAY.  AND IN WHAT MAY PRESAGE A RAFT OF CLAIMS, NORWEGIAN AIR HAS SAID IT WILL SEEK COMPENSATION FROM BOEING FOR COSTS AND LOST REVENUE AFTER GROUNDING ITS FLEET OF 737 MAX.  JAPAN BECAME THE LATEST NATION TO SUSPEND THE 737 MAX PLANES ON THURSDAY. AND AIRLINE GARUDA INDONESIA SAID THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY IT WOULD CANCEL ITS 20-STRONG ORDER OF 737 MAXS.  WHAT HAPPENED?  UNDER INTERNATIONAL RULES, ETHIOPIANS ARE LEADING THE INVESTIGATION BUT FRANCE\u2019S BEA WILL CONDUCT BLACK BOX ANALYSIS AS AN ADVISER. THE U.S. NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) WAS ALSO SENDING THREE INVESTIGATORS TO ASSIST.  ONLY FRANCE AND THE UNITED STATES HAVE THE EXPERIENCE GLEANED FROM BEING PRESENT AT ALMOST EVERY CRASH INVOLVING AN AIRBUS OR BOEING RESPECTIVELY.  SLIDESHOW (15 IMAGES)  THE CAUSE OF THE INDONESIAN CRASH IS STILL BEING INVESTIGATED. A NOVEMBER PRELIMINARY REPORT, BEFORE THE RETRIEVAL OF THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER, FOCUSED ON MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING AND THE RESPONSE OF A BOEING ANTI-STALL SYSTEM TO A RECENTLY REPLACED SENSOR, BUT GAVE NO REASON FOR THE CRASH.  THE PILOT OF ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 302 HAD REPORTED INTERNAL CONTROL PROBLEMS AND RECEIVED PERMISSION TO RETURN, BEFORE THE PLANE CAME DOWN AND BURST INTO A FIREBALL ON ARID FARMLAND.", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2019-03-15T00:00:00", "key": "20190315BA", "labelr0": 1.524243236003214, "labelr1": -1.7704952637272846, "labelr2": 0.3089072740947766, "labelr3": 0.7310607074953855, "labelr4": -0.9198213526159176, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.13699999999999998, "compound": -0.4019, "0_day_return": 1.52424323600322, "1_day_return": 1.52424323600322, "2_day_return": -1.4670571782896658, "3_day_return": -0.7467215493812573, "4_day_return": -1.6596743977413733, "label": 1, "return": 0.0037059469240238938, "excess_return": 1.5205372890791962, "count_of_word": 891, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.49114496, "prof1": 0.50885504, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5094851851745907, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4905148148254092, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.49114496, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.50885504, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.36767238, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.6323276, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.50413704, "tr_prof1": 0.495863, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.4905734000000001, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.50942665, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5496098, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.45039022, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.41528577, "headline_prof21": 0.58471423, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.35545528, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.6445447, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.5643785, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.43562147, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.5779869000000001, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.42201304, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -1.52424323600322, "returnpredvader": -1.52424323600322, "returnpredsgd": -1.52424323600322, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9913606368461503, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9969859483361484, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9995608016550485, "cumreturn1b": 1.131503047033714, "cumreturn1d": 1.028592878652521, "cumreturn1e": 1.0873169768020974, "cumreturndow": 1.1188811768896536, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1058730208168173}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3729, "Unnamed: 0.1": 3729, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 3729, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 3729, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 3729, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 3729, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 3729, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 3729, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 3729, "level_0": 3729, "index": 3729, "text": "ADDIS ABABA/WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - THE CRASH OF AN ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES PLANE THAT KILLED 157 PEOPLE HAD \u201cCLEAR SIMILARITIES\u201d WITH OCTOBER\u2019S LION AIR CRASH, ETHIOPIA SAID ON SUNDAY, SHOWN BY INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE BLACK BOXES RECOVERED FROM THE WRECKAGE OF THE MARCH 10 DISASTER.  THE CRASH HAS GENERATED ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY WATCHED AND HIGH-STAKES INQUIRIES FOR YEARS, WITH THE LATEST VERSION OF BOEING\u2019S PROFITABLE 737 WORKHORSE DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME.  BOTH PLANES WERE MAX 8S, AND BOTH CRASHED MINUTES POST TAKE-OFF AFTER PILOTS REPORTED FLIGHT CONTROL PROBLEMS.

THERE WERE CLEAR SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO CRASHES SO FAR,\u201d ETHIOPIAN TRANSPORT MINISTRY SPOKESMAN MUSE YIHEYIS SAID.  \u201cTHE DATA WAS SUCCESSFULLY RECOVERED. BOTH THE AMERICAN TEAM AND OUR (ETHIOPIAN) TEAM VALIDATED IT,\u201d HE TOLD REUTERS, ADDING THAT THE MINISTRY WOULD PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION AFTER THREE OR FOUR DAYS.  IN WASHINGTON, HOWEVER, U.S. OFFICIALS TOLD REUTERS THE FAA AND U.S. NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) HAD NOT YET VALIDATED THE DATA.  BOEING\u2019S SAFETY ANALYSIS OF A NEW FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM KNOWN AS MCAS ON MAX JETS HAD SEVERAL CRUCIAL FLAWS, ONE OF WHICH WAS THAT IT UNDERSTATED THE POWER OF THE SYSTEM, THE SEATTLE TIMES SAID ON SUNDAY.  THE FAA ALSO DID NOT DELVE IN DETAILED INQUIRIES AND FOLLOWED A STANDARD CERTIFICATION PROCESS ON THE MAX, THE PAPER SAID, CITING AN FAA SPOKESMAN.  THE FAA DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE REPORT BUT REFERRED TO PREVIOUS STATEMENTS ABOUT THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS. IT HAS SAID THE PROCESS FOLLOWED FAA\u2019S STANDARD PROCESS.  CITING PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE INQUIRY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SAID DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS ARE SCRUTINIZING THE FAA\u2019S APPROVAL OF MAX JETS AND A WASHINGTON, D.C. GRAND JURY ISSUED A SUBPOENA TO AT LEAST ONE PERSON INVOLVED IN THE MAX\u2019S DEVELOPMENT.  THE SUBPOENA DATED MARCH 11 - A DAY AFTER THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH - LISTED AS A CONTACT A PROSECUTOR FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT\u2019S (DOJ) CRIMINAL DIVISION AND SOUGHT DOCUMENTS TO BE HANDED OVER LATER THIS MONTH, THE PAPER SAID.

BOEING AND THE FAA DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE WSJ REPORT.  TWO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS BRIEFED ON THE MATTER TOLD REUTERS IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING FOR THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT TO INVESTIGATE A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE, BUT COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY CONFIRM THE REPORT.  SAFETY ANALYSIS  AN OFFICIAL TOLD REUTERS THAT WHEN INVESTIGATORS - AFTER REVIEWING BLACK BOX DATA FROM THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH - RETURN TO ADDIS ABABA TO CONDUCT INTERPRETIVE WORK, THE NTSB AND FAA WILL ASSIST IN VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF THE DATA.

REUTERS/MAHEDER HAILESELASSIE  A SECOND SOURCE SAID LITTLE INFORMATION HAD BEEN CIRCULATED BETWEEN PARTIES ABOUT THE CONTENTS OF DATA AND VOICE RECORDINGS.  IT WAS NOT CLEAR HOW MANY OF THE ROUGHLY 1,800 PARAMETERS OF FLIGHT DATA AND TWO HOURS OF COCKPIT RECORDINGS, SPANNING THE DOOMED SIX-MINUTE FLIGHT AND EARLIER TRIPS, HAD BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE PRELIMINARY ETHIOPIAN ANALYSIS.  INTERNATIONAL RULES REQUIRE A PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE CRASH TO BE RELEASED WITHIN 30 DAYS.  PREVIOUS AIR CRASH REPORTS SHOW THAT IN SUCH HIGH-PROFILE CASES THERE CAN BE DISAGREEMENTS AMONG PARTIES ABOUT THE CAUSE.  IN PARIS, FRANCE\u2019S BEA AIR ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION AGENCY SAID DATA FROM THE JET\u2019S COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DOWNLOADED. THE FRENCH AGENCY SAID ON TWITTER IT HAD NOT LISTENED TO THE AUDIO FILES AND THE DATA HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO ETHIOPIAN INVESTIGATORS.  IN ADDIS ABABA, A SOURCE WHO HAS LISTENED TO THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL RECORDING OF THE PLANE\u2019S COMMUNICATIONS SAID FLIGHT 302 HAD AN UNUSUALLY HIGH SPEED AFTER TAKE-OFF BEFORE IT REPORTED PROBLEMS AND ASKED PERMISSION TO CLIMB QUICKLY.  LAST MONDAY, BOEING, SHARES OF WHICH HAVE FALLEN 10 PERCENT IN THE WEEK SINCE THE CRASH, SAID IT WOULD DEPLOY A SOFTWARE UPGRADE TO THE 737 MAX 8, HOURS AFTER THE FAA SAID IT WOULD MANDATE \u201cDESIGN CHANGES\u201d IN THE AIRCRAFT BY APRIL.  BOEING WAS FINALIZING THE SOFTWARE CHANGE AND A TRAINING REVISION AND WOULD EVALUATE NEW INFORMATION AS IT BECAME AVAILABLE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE DENNIS MUILENBURG SAID IN A STATEMENT ON SUNDAY, AFTER THE ETHIOPIAN TRANSPORT MINISTRY\u2019S COMMENTS.

CANADA SAID IT WOULD INDEPENDENTLY CERTIFY THE 737 MAX IN THE FUTURE, RATHER THAN ACCEPTING FAA VALIDATION, AND WOULD CONDUCT AN \u201cEXHAUSTIVE REVIEW\u201d OF THE AUTOMATED FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM IN MAX AIRCRAFT, KNOWN AS MCAS, WHICH EXPERTS BELIEVE MAY HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN BOTH CRASHES.  CANADA ALSO SAID IT WOULD SEND A TEAM TO HELP U.S. AUTHORITIES EVALUATE PROPOSED DESIGN CHANGES AND DECIDE IF OTHERS WERE NEEDED.  BOEING CO DECLINED TO COMMENT. THE COMPANY ON TUESDAY RESHUFFLED THE TOP EXECUTIVES IN ITS COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES UNIT TO FOCUS ON THE ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS.  U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DO NOT BELIEVE THE TWO CRASHES WILL LEAD TO A WORLDWIDE SHIFT AWAY FROM FAA CERTIFICATIONS BUT U.S. LAWMAKERS, AS WELL AS FEDERAL PROSECUTORS, ARE SCRUTINIZING THE CERTIFICATION OF THE BOEING 737 MAX.  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND ANOTHER KEY DEMOCRAT ASKED THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT\u2019S INSPECTOR GENERAL ON TUESDAY TO EXAMINE KEY DECISIONS MADE BY THE FAA IN CERTIFYING THE 737 MAX JET FOR USE.  THE FAA DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THAT REQUEST OR ON ACTIONS TAKEN BY OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT \u201cTHE CURRENT, HISTORIC AVIATION SAFETY RECORD IN THE U.S. AND GLOBALLY IS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE FAA\u2019S ROBUST PROCESSES AND FULL COLLABORATION WITH THE AVIATION COMMUNITY.\u201d  THE U.S. TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT\u2019S INSPECTOR GENERAL PLANS TO AUDIT THE FAA\u2019S CERTIFICATION OF THE JET, AN OFFICIAL WITH THE OFFICE SAID ON TUESDAY. THE OFFICE CAN RECOMMEND CHANGES OR IMPROVEMENTS TO HOW THE FAA OPERATES. BOEING SAID IT WOULD COOPERATE WITH THE AUDIT.  UNUSUAL INTERVENTION  THE UNUSUAL PUBLIC INTERVENTION BY TWO LEADING REGULATORS CAME AS A PROBE INTO THE FINAL MINUTES OF ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 302 TURNED TOWARD SECRETS HIDDEN IN THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER.  THE VOICES OF CAPTAIN YARED GETACHEW AND FIRST OFFICER AHMEDNUR MOHAMMED COULD HELP EXPLAIN THE MARCH 10 CRASH OF THE BOEING 737 MAX THAT HAS WORRYING PARALLELS WITH ANOTHER DISASTER INVOLVING THE SAME MODEL OFF INDONESIA IN OCTOBER.  THE TWIN DISASTERS KILLED 346 PEOPLE, BUT THERE IS NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE SO FAR THAT THEY ARE LINKED.  BLACK BOX DATA WAS DOWNLOADED IN FRANCE BUT ONLY ETHIOPIAN EXPERTS LEADING THE PROBE HAVE ACCESS TO THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN GETACHEW, 29, AND MOHAMMED, 25. THE DATA WAS BACK IN ADDIS ABABA ON TUESDAY, SOURCES FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBE TOLD REUTERS.  EXPERTS BELIEVE THE NEW MCAS SYSTEM, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO STOP STALLING BY DIPPING THE NOSE, MAY HAVE BEEN A FACTOR IN BOTH CRASHES, WITH PILOTS UNABLE TO OVERRIDE IT AS THEIR JETS PLUNGED DOWNWARDS.  BOTH CAME DOWN JUST MINUTES AFTER TAKE-OFF AFTER ERRATIC FLIGHT PATTERNS AND LOSS OF CONTROL REPORTED BY THE PILOTS. HOWEVER, EVERY ACCIDENT IS A UNIQUE CHAIN OF HUMAN AND TECHNICAL FACTORS, EXPERTS SAY.  THE PRESTIGE OF ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES, ONE OF AFRICA\u2019S MOST SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES, AND BOEING, THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST PLANEMAKER AND A MASSIVE U.S. EXPORTER, ARE AT STAKE.  AWKWARD QUESTIONS FOR INDUSTRY  LAWMAKERS AND SAFETY EXPERTS ARE QUESTIONING HOW THOROUGHLY REGULATORS VETTED THE MAX MODEL AND HOW WELL PILOTS WERE TRAINED ON NEW FEATURES. FOR NOW, GLOBAL REGULATORS HAVE GROUNDED THE EXISTING FLEET OF MORE THAN 300 MAX AIRCRAFT, AND DELIVERIES OF NEARLY 5,000 MORE - WORTH WELL OVER $500 BILLION - ARE ON HOLD. (GRAPHIC: TMSNRT.RS/2HV2BTC)  PRESSURE ON CHICAGO-HEADQUARTERED BOEING HAS GROWN WITH NEWS THAT FEDERAL PROSECUTORS ARE SCRUTINISING HOW CAREFULLY THE MAX MODEL WAS DEVELOPED, TWO PEOPLE BRIEFED ON THE MATTER SAID.  THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO LOOKING AT THE FAA\u2019S OVERSIGHT OF BOEING, ONE OF THE PEOPLE SAID. AND A FEDERAL GRAND JURY LAST WEEK ISSUED AT LEAST ONE SUBPOENA TO AN ENTITY INVOLVED IN THE PLANE\u2019S DEVELOPMENT.  U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP PLANS TO NOMINATE FORMER DELTA AIR LINES EXECUTIVE STEVE DICKSON TO HEAD THE FAA ON TUESDAY. THE AGENCY HAS BEEN WITHOUT A PERMANENT HEAD FOR 14 MONTHS.  IN THE HOPE OF GETTING ITS MAX LINE BACK INTO THE AIR SOON, BOEING HAS SAID IT WILL ROLL OUT A SOFTWARE UPDATE AND REVISE PILOT TRAINING. IN THE CASE OF THE LION AIR CRASH IN INDONESIA, IT HAS RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER CREW USED THE CORRECT PROCEDURES.  DEVELOPMENT OF THE 737 MAX, WHICH OFFERS COST SAVINGS OF ABOUT 15 PERCENT ON FUEL, BEGAN IN 2011 AFTER THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH BY ITS MAIN RIVAL OF THE AIRBUS A320NEO. THE 737 MAX ENTERED SERVICE IN 2017 AFTER SIX YEARS OF PREPARATION.  ARGUS RESEARCH CUT BOEING STOCK TO \u201cHOLD\u201d FROM \u201cBUY\u201d, GIVING THE PLANEMAKER AT LEAST ITS FOURTH DOWNGRADE SINCE THE CRASH, REFINITIV DATA SHOWED. ITS SHARES ROSE 0.3 PERCENT ON TUESDAY, TO CLOSE AT $373.43. THEY ARE STILL DOWN MORE THAN 11 PERCENT SINCE THE CRASH IN ETHIOPIA.  GLOBAL RAMIFICATIONS  VARIOUS FIRMS ARE RECONSIDERING BOEING ORDERS, AND SOME ARE REVISING FINANCIAL FORECASTS GIVEN THEY NOW CANNOT COUNT ON MAINTENANCE AND FUEL SAVINGS FACTORED IN FROM THE MAX.  AIR CANADA SAID IT INTENDED TO KEEP ITS MAX AIRCRAFT GROUNDED UNTIL AT LEAST JULY 1, WOULD ACCELERATE INTAKE OF RECENTLY ACQUIRED AIRBUS A321 PLANES, AND HAD HIRED OTHER CARRIERS TO PROVIDE EXTRA CAPACITY MEANTIME.

BOEING, IN THE MIDST OF ONE ITS WORST CRISES IN YEARS, IS UNDER PRESSURE FROM CRASH VICTIMS\u2019 FAMILIES, AIRLINES, LAWMAKERS IN WASHINGTON AND REGULATORS AROUND THE WORLD TO PROVE THAT THE AUTOMATED FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEMS ABOARD ITS 737 MAX AIRCRAFT ARE SAFE, AND THAT PILOTS HAVE THE TRAINING REQUIRED TO OVERRIDE THE SYSTEM IN AN EMERGENCY.  A BOEING OFFICIAL IN SEATTLE SAID ON WEDNESDAY THE TIMING OF THE SOFTWARE UPGRADE WAS \u201c100 PERCENT INDEPENDENT OF THE TIMING OF THE ETHIOPIAN ACCIDENT,\u201d AND THE COMPANY WAS TAKING STEPS TO MAKE THE ANTI-STALL SYSTEM \u201cMORE ROBUST.\u201d  THERE WAS NO NEED TO OVERHAUL BOEING\u2019S REGULATORY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) NOW, THE COMPANY SAID.  \u201cWE ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT ACCIDENTS LIKE THESE NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN,\u201d MIKE SINNETT, VICE PRESIDENT FOR PRODUCT STRATEGY AND FUTURE AIRPLANE DEVELOPMENT TOLD REPORTERS.  THE FAA SAID IT HAD NOT REVIEWED OR CERTIFIED THE SOFTWARE UPGRADE YET.  U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY ELAINE CHAO AND SOME LAWMAKERS ON WEDNESDAY QUESTIONED WHY BOEING DID NOT REQUIRE SAFETY FEATURES ON ITS TOP-SELLING PLANE THAT MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED THE CRASHES.  \u201cIT IS VERY QUESTIONABLE IF THESE WERE SAFETY-ORIENTED ADDITIONS, WHY THEY WERE NOT PART OF THE REQUIRED TEMPLATE OF MEASURES THAT SHOULD GO INTO AN AIRPLANE,\u201d SHE SAID, ADDING SHE WAS NOT READY TO REQUIRE THAT ALL SAFETY OPTIONS BE RETROFITTED ON EXISTING AIRPLANE.  A SPOKESMAN FOR THE FAA SAID THE AGENCY HAD NOT REVIEWED OR CERTIFIED THE SOFTWARE UPGRADE YET.  EXECUTIVES WITH U.S. AIRLINES WELCOMED BOEING\u2019S MOVES, BUT WANT U.S. REGULATORS TO SIGN OFF ON THE UPGRADE.  SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO, WHICH ON WEDNESDAY BECAME THE FIRST MAJOR AIRLINE TO FORMALLY CUT ITS FINANCIAL OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR AFTER BEING FORCED TO PULL ITS MAX FLEET OF 34 JETS OUT OF SERVICE, SUPPORTED BOEING\u2019S DECISION.  \u201cBOEING\u2019S SOFTWARE UPDATE APPEARS TO ADD YET ANOTHER LAYER OF SAFETY TO THE OPERATION OF THE MAX AIRCRAFT,\u201d SOUTHWEST\u2019S CERTIFICATE CHIEF PILOT BOB WALTZ SAID.  ALLIED PILOTS ASSOCIATION, WHICH REPRESENTS AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC PILOTS, SAID IT WAS PLEASED WITH BOEING\u2019S PROGRESS BUT WARNED THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS SHOULD NOT BE RUSHED. THE FIX SHOULD BE FULLY VETTED AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANY FURTHER INFORMATION FROM AN INVESTIGATION INTO AN ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH ON MARCH 10, THE ASSOCIATION SAID IN A STATEMENT.  UNITED AIRLINES VICE PRESIDENT MICHAEL QUIELLO SAID THE AIRLINE WAS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE SOFTWARE UPDATE, BUT WAS COUNTING ON THE FAA TO CERTIFY THE CHANGE.  AIRLINE STOCKS TURNED POSITIVE AFTER BOEING UNVEILED THE SOFTWARE FIX. CFRA ANALYST JIM CORRIDORE, WHO HAS A \u201cBUY\u201d RATING ON BOEING, SAID NEWS FROM THE COMPANY AND THE WASHINGTON HEARING WERE POSITIVE STEPS TOWARD GETTING THE MAX JETS AIRBORNE AGAIN.  THE ANGLE OF ATTACK SENSOR, AT BOTTOM CENTER, IS SEEN ON A 737 MAX AIRCRAFT AT THE BOEING FACTORY IN RENTON, WASHINGTON, U.S., MARCH 27, 2019. REUTERS/LINDSEY WASSON  EXTRA COMPUTER TRAINING  THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST PLANEMAKER SAID THE ANTI-STALL SYSTEM, WHICH IS BELIEVED TO HAVE REPEATEDLY FORCED THE NOSE LOWER IN AT LEAST ONE OF THE ACCIDENTS, IN INDONESIA LAST OCTOBER, WOULD ONLY DO SO ONE TIME AFTER SENSING A PROBLEM, GIVING PILOTS MORE CONTROL.  IT WILL ALSO BE DISABLED IF TWO AIRFLOW SENSORS THAT MEASURE THE \u201cANGLE OF ATTACK,\u201d OR ANGLE OF THE WING TO THE AIRFLOW, A FUNDAMENTAL PARAMETER OF FLIGHT, OFFER WIDELY DIFFERENT READINGS, BOEING SAID. REUTERS REPORTED THOSE DETAILS EARLIER THIS WEEK.  THE ANTI-STALL SYSTEM - KNOWN AS MCAS, OR MANEUVERING CHARACTERISTICS AUGMENTATION SYSTEM - HAS BEEN PINPOINTED BY INVESTIGATORS AS A POSSIBLE CAUSE IN A FATAL LION AIR CRASH IN INDONESIA AND THE ONE IN ETHIOPIA.  EXISTING 737 PILOTS WILL ALSO HAVE EXTRA COMPUTER-BASED TRAINING FOLLOWING CRITICISM THAT MCAS WAS NOT DESCRIBED IN THE AIRCRAFT MANUAL.  BOEING HAS PREVIOUSLY SAID EXISTING COCKPIT PROCEDURES WOULD COVER ANY EXAMPLE OF RUNAWAY CONTROLS CAUSED BY MCAS.  THE CHANGES WERE DRAWN UP IN RESPONSE TO THE LION AIR CRASH BUT ARE SEEN AS CRUCIAL TO REGAINING THE TRUST OF PILOTS, PASSENGERS AND REGULATORS AFTER THE ETHIOPIA CRASH PROMPTED A WORLDWIDE GROUNDING OF BOEING 737 MAX PLANES.  ETHIOPIAN OFFICIALS AND SOME ANALYSTS HAVE SAID THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES JET BEHAVED IN A SIMILAR PATTERN BEFORE CRASHING SHORTLY AFTER TAKE-OFF FROM ADDIS ABABA, BUT THAT INVESTIGATION IS STILL AT AN EARLY STAGE.  BOEING\u2019S SINNETT SAID THE SOFTWARE HAD BEEN THROUGH EXTENSIVE TESTING, INCLUDING FLIGHTS WITH THE FAA. HOWEVER, HE SAID HE COULD PROVIDE NO TIMEFRAME FOR WHEN THE 737 MAX JETS WOULD RETURN TO SERVICE.  BOEING SAID IT WOULD CHANGE THE DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM SO THAT IT NO LONGER RELIED ON A SINGLE SENSOR. THE CHANGES ALSO WOULD MAKE STANDARD VISUAL WARNINGS TO THE PILOTS IF THE SYSTEM HAD STOPPED WORKING. PREVIOUSLY, THOSE WARNING MESSAGES AND DISPLAYS HAD BEEN OPTIONAL.  SLIDESHOW (4 IMAGES)  REUTERS REPORTED IN NOVEMBER AFTER THE LION AIR DISASTER THAT SOME AVIATION EXPERTS BELIEVED THE OPTIONAL ALERT COULD HAVE ALERTED ENGINEERS ABOUT MECHANICAL FAULTS, LEADING TO AN INDUSTRY DEBATE OVER WHETHER THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE MANDATORY.  CURRENT 737 MAX PILOTS HAVE CRITICIZED BOEING FOR NOT DISCLOSING MORE DETAILS ABOUT MCAS INITIALLY. SINNETT SAID THE COMPANY HAS ADDED DETAILS ON MCAS TO ITS FLIGHT CREW OPERATIONS MANUAL. ALL PILOTS WILL NEED TO COMPLETE THIS TRAINING BEFORE RETURNING TO THE SKIES, HE SAID.

REUTERS/TIKSA NEGERI/FILE PHOTO  INVESTIGATORS LOOKING TO UNCOVER THE CAUSES MUST ANSWER ONE OF THE BIGGEST QUESTIONS: WAS THE PLANE\u2019S SOFTWARE TO BLAME?  WHAT WE KNOW     BOEING HAS STOPPED DELIVERY OF ALL NEW MAX JETS. ITS STOCK HAS FALLEN 7.5 PERCENT SINCE THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH.     BOEING MAINTAINS ITS NEW, FUEL-EFFICIENT JETS ARE SAFE, BUT SUPPORTED THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) DECISION TO GROUND THEM.     EUROPE AND CANADA SAID THEY WOULD INDEPENDENTLY CERTIFY THE SAFETY OF THE JETS, FURTHER COMPLICATING PLANS TO GET THE AIRCRAFT BACK FLYING.     BOEING WILL MANDATE ON MAX JETS A PREVIOUSLY OPTIONAL COCKPIT WARNING LIGHT, WHICH MIGHT HAVE WARNED OF PROBLEMS THAT POSSIBLY PLAYED A ROLE IN THE ETHIOPIAN AND INDONESIAN CRASHES, SOURCES SAID ON MARCH 21.     INDONESIA\u2019S FLAG CARRIER GARUDA SAID ON MARCH 22 IT HAD SENT A LETTER TO BOEING ASKING TO CANCEL AN ORDER FOR 49 MAX 8 AIRCRAFT, BECOMING THE FIRST AIRLINE TO CONFIRM PLANS TO CANCEL AN ORDER AFTER THE CRASHES.     INVESTIGATORS HAVE FOUND SIMILARITIES IN THE \u2018ANGLE OF ATTACK\u2019 DATA FROM BOTH FLIGHTS. A PIECE OF A STABILIZER IN THE WRECKAGE OF THE ETHIOPIAN JET WITH THE TRIM SET IN AN UNUSUAL POSITION WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE LION AIR PLANE, SOURCES SAID.     EXPERTS BELIEVE A NEW FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM, MCAS, ON THE JETS, DESIGNED TO STOP STALLING BY DIPPING THE NOSE, MAY HAVE BEEN A FACTOR IN BOTH CRASHES, WITH PILOTS UNABLE TO OVERRIDE IT AS THEIR JETS PLUNGED AFTER A FAULTY SENSOR INDICATED A STALL. BUT NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE YET LINKS THE TWO ACCIDENTS.     THE MCAS SYSTEM ON THE ETHIOPIAN FLIGHT RE-ENGAGED AS MANY AS FOUR TIMES AFTER THE CREW INITIALLY TURNED IT OFF, TWO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER TOLD REUTERS ON APRIL 3.     THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTED ON APRIL 3 THAT THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES PILOTS HAD INITIALLY FOLLOWED BOEING\u2019S EMERGENCY PROCEDURES BUT LATER DEVIATED FROM THEM AS THEY TRIED TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE PLANE.     BOEING\u2019S COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DIVISION HAS BROUGHT IN A NEW VICE PRESIDENT OF ENGINEERING WHILE DEDICATING ANOTHER TOP EXECUTIVE TO THE AIRCRAFT INVESTIGATIONS, A COMPANY EMAIL SHOWED.  WHAT\u2019S NEXT?     ETHIOPIA IS DUE TO PUBLISH THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF AN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION WITHIN DAYS.     INDONESIA HAS ADVANCED THE PLANNED RELEASE OF ITS REPORT ON THE LION AIR CRASH TO BETWEEN JULY AND AUGUST, VERSUS A PREVIOUS SCHEDULE OF BETWEEN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER.     U.S. LAWMAKERS SAID THE 737 MAX COULD BE GROUNDED FOR WEEKS TO UPGRADE SOFTWARE IN EVERY PLANE. OTHER COUNTRIES MAY GROUND THE PLANES EVEN LONGER.     THE U.S. TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT\u2019S INSPECTOR GENERAL PLANS TO AUDIT THE FAA\u2019S CERTIFICATION OF THE JET, AN OFFICIAL WITH THE OFFICE SAID ON MARCH 19. THE OFFICE CAN RECOMMEND CHANGES OR IMPROVEMENTS TO HOW THE FAA OPERATES.     THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO LOOKING AT THE FAA\u2019S OVERSIGHT OF BOEING, A PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER HAS SAID.

THE NO. 1 U.S. CARRIER OWNS 24 OF THE BRAND-NEW BOEING CO AIRCRAFT WHOSE USE WAS SUSPENDED AROUND THE WORLD IN MARCH.  THE MAX GROUNDING CAUSED 1,200 AMERICAN FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER, IN ADDITION TO 940 CANCELLATIONS DUE TO AMERICAN\u2019S DECISION TO REMOVE 14 737-800 AIRCRAFT FROM SERVICE AFTER PILOTS COMPLAINED THAT OVERHEAD BINS WERE NOT CLOSING ON SOME RECENTLY RETROFITTED CABINS.

HOWEVER, BOEING HAS NOT YET SUBMITTED ITS COMPLETED SOFTWARE PACKAGE TO THE FAA FOR APPROVAL, TWO OTHER SOURCES SAID.  NONE OF THE SOURCES, WHO WERE NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPEAK PUBLICLY, SAID THEY KNEW FOR SURE HOW LONG THE RE-CERTIFICATION PROCESS WILL TAKE.  A BOEING SPOKESWOMAN SAID THE COMPANY IS FOCUSED ON THE SAFE RETURN TO SERVICE OF THE MAX AND ITS ENGAGEMENT WITH GLOBAL REGULATORS AND CUSTOMERS.  BOEING CHIEF EXECUTIVE DENNIS MUILENBURG SAID LAST WEEK THE COMPANY HAD MADE THE FINAL TEST FLIGHT WITH THE NEW MAX SOFTWARE BEFORE A FINAL CERTIFICATION FLIGHT, INDICATING THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVED IT WAS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD REGULATORY APPROVAL.  ON APRIL 1, THE FAA SAID THAT ONCE IT RECEIVED BOEING\u2019S COMPLETED SOFTWARE PACKAGE IT WOULD RUN A RIGOROUS SAFETY REVIEW BEFORE APPROVING THE SOFTWARE FOR INSTALLATION.

ASIDE FROM THE SOFTWARE CERTIFICATION, INTERNATIONAL REGULATORS MUST ALSO DECIDE ON NEW PILOT TRAINING.  THIS PROCESS IS SEPARATE FROM AN FAA-LED INTERNATIONAL REVIEW PANEL, WHICH THE AGENCY HAS SAID MAY NOT BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE MAX FLYING SUSPENSION IS LIFTED.  THE TWO LARGEST U.S. MAX OWNERS, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO AND AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC, REMOVED THE AIRCRAFT FROM THEIR FLYING SCHEDULES INTO AUGUST BUT HAVE SAID THEY COULD USE THEIR MAX JETS AS SPARES IF THEY ARE UNGROUNDED SOONER.  UNITED AIRLINES, WITH 14 MAX JETS, SAID LAST WEEK THAT IT EXPECTED THE AIRCRAFT TO RETURN TO SERVICE THIS SUMMER, WITH DELIVERIES RESUMING BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.  BOEING HALTED MAX DELIVERIES TO CUSTOMERS AFTER THE GROUNDING IN MID-MARCH AND SAID EARLIER THIS MONTH THAT IT WOULD CUT 737 PRODUCTION TO 42 AIRPLANES PER MONTH FROM 52.  ONE INDUSTRY SOURCE SAID THAT AS OF LAST WEEK, BOEING PLANNED TO KEEP THE LOWER PRODUCTION RATE IN PLACE FOR TWO MONTHS, MEANING IT AIMS TO RESUME A RATE OF 52 AIRCRAFT IN JULY BUT THE TIMELINE COULD SHIFT.

BOEING HALTED DELIVERIES OF THE 737 MAX IN MARCH AFTER REGULATORS GROUNDED THE PLANE IN THE WAKE OF TWO FATAL ACCIDENTS. IT CONTINUES TO PRODUCE THE PLANE BUT AT A SLOWER RATE OF 42 AIRPLANES PER MONTH INSTEAD OF 52. STARTING AND STOPPING AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION LINES IS EXPENSIVE.  CFM HAS SO FAR KEPT ENGINE PRODUCTION AT A RATE CONSISTENT WITH BOEING\u2019S PREVIOUS OUTPUT OF 52 JETS A MONTH BECAUSE THE EXTRA ENGINES ARE BEING DIVERTED TO EQUIP PLANES THAT HAD BEEN LEFT WITHOUT ENGINES AT THE BOEING PLANT DUE TO EARLIER DELAYS.  SAFRAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE PHILPPE PETITCOLIN SAID HE EXPECTED THIS \u201cRECOVERY PROCESS\u201d TO BE COMPLETED IN MAY.  HE DID NOT SAY HOW CFM WOULD RESPOND AFTER THAT, BUT INDUSTRY SOURCES SAY FEW DECISIONS ARE EXPECTED UNTIL BOEING HAS AT LEAST A THEORETICAL TIMETABLE FOR THE UNGROUNDING OF THE PLANE.  FINANCE DIRECTOR BERNARD DELPIT SAID SAFRAN WAS SEEING A \u201cSLIGHT CASH IMPACT\u201d FROM BOEING\u2019S DELIVERY FREEZE BECAUSE IT GETS PAID A PORTION OF ITS ENGINE REVENUE FROM BOEING WHEN THE AIRCRAFT IS DELIVERED.  BUT HE SAID THIS WAS BEING OFFSET BY STRONG CASHFLOW IN THE REST OF THE GROUP.  FIRST-QUARTER SALES INCLUDED LIKE-FOR-LIKE GROWTH OF 13.3 PERCENT IN AEROSYSTEMS AND AIRCRAFT INTERIORS, WHICH INCLUDES ACTIVITIES ACQUIRED THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF ZODIAC AEROSPACE LAST YEAR. THESE COUNT IN SAFRAN\u2019S EARNINGS FROM MARCH 2018.  SAFRAN WARNED THIS RATE OF GROWTH WAS \u201cNOT FULLY REPRESENTATIVE\u201d OF THE ANNUAL TREND, EVEN THOUGH ITS \u2018SEATS\u2019 DIVISION RESUMED LIKE-FOR-LIKE GROWTH IN THE FIRST QUARTER.  THE CIVIL AFTERMARKET GREW 10.2 PERCENT IN DOLLAR TERMS IN THE FIRST QUARTER, SAFRAN SAID.

THE COMMENTS WERE MADE BY THE ALLIED PILOTS ASSOCIATION (APA), WHICH REPRESENTS PILOTS AT AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC , THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST AIRLINE AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST 737 MAX OPERATORS IN THE UNITED STATES.  THEIR SUPPORT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE BOEING HAS SAID PILOTS\u2019 CONFIDENCE IN THE 737 MAX WILL PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN CONVINCING THE PUBLIC THAT THE AIRCRAFT IS SAFE TO FLY AGAIN.  BOEING\u2019S FAST-SELLING 737 MAX WAS GROUNDED WORLDWIDE IN MARCH FOLLOWING A FATAL ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH THAT KILLED ALL 157 ON BOARD JUST FIVE MONTHS AFTER A SIMILAR CRASH ON A LION AIR FLIGHT THAT KILLED ALL 189 PASSENGERS AND CREW.  NOW IT IS READYING FOR REGULATORY APPROVAL A FINAL SOFTWARE UPDATE AND TRAINING PACKAGE TO ADDRESS AN ANTI-STALL SYSTEM KNOWN AS MCAS THAT PLAYED A ROLE IN BOTH NOSE-DOWN CRASHES.  A DRAFT REPORT BY AN FAA-APPOINTED BOARD OF PILOTS, ENGINEERS AND OTHER EXPERTS CONCLUDED THAT PILOTS ONLY NEED ADDITIONAL COMPUTER-BASED TRAINING TO UNDERSTAND MCAS, RATHER THAN SIMULATOR TIME. THE PUBLIC HAS UNTIL APRIL 30 TO MAKE COMMENTS.  PROTESTERS ARE EXPECTED OUTSIDE BOEING\u2019S ANNUAL MEETING IN CHICAGO ON MONDAY, WHERE SHAREHOLDERS WILL ALSO QUESTION THE COMPANY OVER ITS SAFETY RECORD.  APA IS ARGUING THAT MERE COMPUTER EXPLANATION \u201cWILL NOT PROVIDE A LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE FOR PILOTS TO FEEL NOT ONLY COMFORTABLE FLYING THE AIRCRAFT BUT ALSO RELAYING THAT CONFIDENCE TO THE TRAVELING PUBLIC.\u201d  IT SAID THE MAX COMPUTER TRAINING, WHICH ORIGINALLY INVOLVED A ONE-HOUR IPAD COURSE, SHOULD INCLUDE VIDEOS OF SIMULATOR SESSIONS SHOWING HOW MCAS WORKS ALONG WITH DEMONSTRATIONS OF OTHER COCKPIT EMERGENCIES SUCH AS RUNAWAY STABILIZER, A LOSS OF CONTROL THAT OCCURRED ON BOTH DOOMED FLIGHTS.  APA ALSO CALLED FOR RECURRING TRAINING ON SIMULATORS THAT INCLUDES SCENARIOS LIKE THOSE EXPERIENCED BY THE LION AIR AND ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES PILOTS, IN ADDITION TO COMPUTER TRAINING.  \u201cWHEN PILOTS VISUALLY EXPERIENCE THE FAILURE MODES AND THEN APPLY THEM, THE LESSON IS CEMENTED IN THEIR MINDS,\u201d APA WROTE.  AMERICAN AIRLINES HAS SAID IT IS LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES IN COORDINATION WITH THE FAA AND ITS PILOTS UNION.  CANADA, EUROPE AND SOUTH KOREA ARE ALL WEIGHING THE NEED FOR SIMULATOR TRAINING, GOING ABOVE THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE DRAFT FAA REPORT, SOURCES HAVE SAID.  REQUIRED SIMULATOR TRAINING COULD DELAY THE MAX\u2019S RETURN TO SERVICE BECAUSE IT TAKES TIME TO SCHEDULE HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF PILOTS ON SIMULATORS. HOURLY RATES FOR SIMULATORS RANGE BETWEEN $500 AND $1000, EXCLUDING TRAVEL EXPENSES.  AMERICAN AIRLINES CHIEF EXECUTIVE DOUG PARKER SAID ON FRIDAY THAT EVEN IF OTHER COUNTRIES DELAY THE UNGROUNDING OF THE MAX, ONCE THE FAA APPROVES IT, AMERICAN WILL START FLYING ITS 24 AIRCRAFT.  UNION PILOTS FOR SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO, THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST OPERATOR OF THE MAX WITH 34 JETS AND DOZENS MORE ON ORDER, HAVE SAID THEY WERE SATISFIED WITH THE FAA DRAFT REPORT BUT WOULD DECIDE ON ADDITIONAL TRAINING ONCE THEY SEE BOEING\u2019S FINAL PROPOSALS.", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2019-04-29T00:00:00", "key": "20190429BA", "labelr0": -0.4569447727093698, "labelr1": -0.35879171613243993, "labelr2": -0.2356429876353587, "labelr3": -0.2653927813163482, "labelr4": 0.17562533262372754, "pos": 0.35, "neg": 0.085, "compound": 0.6908, "0_day_return": -0.4569447727093667, "1_day_return": -0.4569447727093667, "2_day_return": -0.5935892362485151, "3_day_return": -0.8574066745811959, "4_day_return": -0.683287165281643, "label": -1, "return": 0.0009514170675830179, "excess_return": -0.4578961897769498, "count_of_word": 529, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5019692, "prof1": 0.49803087, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5163139932824979, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4836860067175019, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5019692, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.49803087, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.28421795, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.71578205, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.54414946, "tr_prof1": 0.4558505, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.42367676, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.5763233, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.40675843, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.5932415, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.44228894, "headline_prof21": 0.55771106, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.4877527, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5122473, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.77752036, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.22247960000000006, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.735681, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.26431897, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": 0.4569447727093667, "returnpredvader": -0.4569447727093667, "returnpredsgd": 0.4569447727093667, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9997017853386951, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9997017853386951, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9968784250045277, "cumreturn1b": 1.1621987808225365, "cumreturn1d": 0.9863773156752524, "cumreturn1e": 1.131234685810602, "cumreturndow": 1.1634675966431227, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1348409680540232}, {"Unnamed: 0": 5957, "Unnamed: 0.1": 5957, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 5957, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 5957, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 5957, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 5957, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 5957, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 5957, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 5957, "level_0": 5957, "index": 5957, "text": "DUBAI, APRIL 30 (REUTERS) - FLYDUBAI\u2019S CHIEF EXECUTIVE GHAITH AL-GHAITH SAID ON TUESDAY HE IS VERY CONFIDENT THAT BOEING WILL TAKE THE RIGHT DECISION REGARDING THE GROUNDED 737 MAX.  \u201cI TRUST THAT THE RELEVANT AUTHORITY WILL ENSURE THE BOEING 737 MAX IS THE SAFEST,\u201d GHAITH SAID AT A CAPA AVIATION SUMMIT IN DUBAI.

REUTERS/LINDSEY WASSON/FILE PHOTO  THE U.S. PLANEMAKER HAS BEEN TRYING FOR WEEKS TO DISPEL SUGGESTIONS THAT IT MADE AIRLINES PAY FOR SAFETY FEATURES AFTER IT EMERGED THAT AN ALERT DESIGNED TO SHOW DISCREPANCIES IN ANGLE OF ATTACK READINGS FROM TWO SENSORS WAS OPTIONAL ON THE 737 MAX.  ERRONEOUS DATA FROM A SENSOR RESPONSIBLE FOR MEASURING THE ANGLE AT WHICH THE WING SLICES THROUGH THE AIR - KNOWN AS THE ANGLE OF ATTACK - IS SUSPECTED OF TRIGGERING A FLAWED PIECE OF SOFTWARE THAT PUSHED THE PLANE DOWNWARD IN TWO RECENT CRASHES.  IN A STATEMENT, BOEING SAID IT ONLY DISCOVERED ONCE DELIVERIES OF THE 737 MAX HAD BEGUN IN 2017 THAT THE SO-CALLED AOA DISAGREE ALERT WAS OPTIONAL INSTEAD OF STANDARD AS IT HAD INTENDED, BUT ADDED THAT WAS NOT CRITICAL SAFETY DATA.  A FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL TOLD REUTERS ON SUNDAY THAT BOEING WAITED 13 MONTHS BEFORE INFORMING THE AGENCY IN NOVEMBER 2018.  BY BECOMING OPTIONAL, THE ALERT HAD BEEN TREATED IN THE SAME WAY AS A SEPARATE INDICATOR SHOWING RAW AOA DATA, WHICH IS SELDOM USED BY COMMERCIAL PILOTS AND HAD BEEN AN ADD-ON FOR YEARS.  \u201cNEITHER THE ANGLE OF ATTACK INDICATOR NOR THE AOA DISAGREE ALERT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE SAFE OPERATION OF THE AIRPLANE,\u201d BOEING SAID.  \u201cTHEY PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ONLY, AND HAVE NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED SAFETY FEATURES ON COMMERCIAL JET TRANSPORT AIRPLANES.\u201d  BOEING SAID A SAFETY REVIEW BOARD CONVENED AFTER A FATAL LION AIR CRASH IN INDONESIA LAST OCTOBER CORROBORATED ITS PRIOR CONCLUSION THAT THE ALERT WAS NOT NECESSARY FOR THE SAFE OPERATION OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND COULD SAFELY BE TACKLED IN A FUTURE SYSTEM UPDATE.  THE FAA BACKED THAT ASSESSMENT BUT CRITICIZED BOEING FOR BEING SLOW TO DISCLOSE THE PROBLEM.  BOEING BRIEFED THE FAA ON THE DISPLAY ISSUE IN NOVEMBER, AFTER THE LION AIR ACCIDENT, AND A SPECIAL PANEL DEEMED IT TO BE \u201cLOW RISK,\u201d AN FAA SPOKESMAN SAID.  \u201cHOWEVER, BOEING\u2019S TIMELY OR EARLIER COMMUNICATION WITH THE OPERATORS WOULD HAVE HELPED TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE POSSIBLE CONFUSION,\u201d HE ADDED.  BOEING ATTRIBUTED THE ERROR TO SOFTWARE DELIVERED TO THE COMPANY FROM AN OUTSIDE SOURCE, BUT DID NOT GIVE DETAILS.  INDUSTRY DEBATE  SUNDAY\u2019S STATEMENT MARKED THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE TWO FATAL ACCIDENTS THAT BOEING EXPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGED DOING SOMETHING INADVERTENTLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 737 MAX, ALBEIT ON AN ISSUE THAT IT CONTENDS HAS NO IMPACT ON SAFETY.  BOEING HAS SAID THE FEEDING OF ERRONEOUS ANGLE OF ATTACK DATA TO A SYSTEM CALLED MCAS THAT PUSHED THE PLANES LOWER WAS A COMMON LINK IN TWO WIDER CHAINS OF EVENTS LEADING TO BOTH CRASHES, BUT HAS STOPPED SHORT OF ADMITTING ERROR ON THAT FRONT.  THE ANGLE OF ATTACK MEASURES THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE AIR FLOW AND THE WING AND HELPS DETERMINE WHETHER THE PLANE IS ABLE TO FLY CORRECTLY. IF THE ANGLE BECOMES TOO STEEP, THE FLOW OF AIR OVER THE WING IS DISTURBED, THROWING THE PLANE INTO AN AERODYNAMIC STALL. THAT MEANS IT STARTS TO FALL INSTEAD OF FLY.  ALTHOUGH THE ANGLE ITSELF IS KEY FOR ONBOARD SYSTEMS, THE INDUSTRY HAS DEBATED FOR YEARS WHETHER SUCH DATA SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN ALREADY CROWDED COCKPIT DISPLAYS BECAUSE IT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO AIRSPEED, WHICH PILOTS ALREADY SCRUTINIZE.  SOME ANALYSTS AND ACADEMICS SAY HAVING THE AOA DISAGREE ALERT INSTALLED WOULD HAVE HELPED LION AIR MAINTENANCE CREW DIAGNOSE A PROBLEM ON THE PENULTIMATE FLIGHT OF THE 737 MAX JET THAT CRASHED IN OCTOBER, KILLING ALL 189 ON BOARD.  THE 737 MAX WAS GROUNDED WORLDWIDE OVER SAFETY CONCERNS FOLLOWING THE ETHIOPIAN CRASH IN MARCH, KILLING 157 PEOPLE.  WHEN THE JET RETURNS TO SERVICE, ALL NEW AIRCRAFT WILL HAVE A WORKING AOA DISAGREE ALERT AS A STANDARD FEATURE AND A NO-CHARGE OPTIONAL INDICATOR SHOWING THE UNDERLYING DATA, BOEING SAID. THAT RESTORES THE SITUATION FOUND ON THE DISPLAYS OF PREVIOUS 737NG MODELS SINCE AROUND THE MIDDLE OF LAST DECADE.  AIRLINES WITH GROUNDED 737 MAX JETS WILL BE ABLE TO ACTIVATE THE AOA DISAGREE FUNCTION DIRECTLY.  BOEING IS ALSO DEVELOPING A SOFTWARE UPGRADE AND TRAINING CHANGES TO THE MCAS SYSTEM THAT MUST BE APPROVED BY GLOBAL REGULATORS BEFORE THE JETS CAN FLY AGAIN.

FILE PHOTO - ACTING DEFENSE SECRETARY PATRICK SHANAHAN (L) LISTENS AS U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HOLDS A MEETING WITH SENIOR MILITARY LEADERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN WASHINGTON, U.S., APRIL 3, 2019. REUTERS/KEVIN LAMARQUE  SHANAHAN HAD BEEN UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE PENTAGON INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR ALLEGEDLY SEEKING PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF BOEING WHILE AT THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT BUT HE WAS CLEARED OF WRONGDOING IN APRIL. HE HAS BEEN ACTING DEFENSE SECRETARY SINCE JANUARY, THE LONGEST IN PENTAGON HISTORY.  \u201cBASED UPON HIS OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY AND HIS DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO LEAD, PRESIDENT TRUMP INTENDS TO NOMINATE PATRICK M. SHANAHAN TO BE THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE,\u201d WHITE HOUSE SPOKESWOMAN SARAH SANDERS SAID IN A STATEMENT.  EARLY TESTS FOR SHANAHAN WILL INCLUDE HANDLING GROWING TENSIONS WITH IRAN, RENEWED MISSILE TESTS BY NORTH KOREA AND QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HANDLE THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS IN VENEZUELA.  SHANAHAN SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT HE WAS COMMITTED TO MODERNIZING U.S. MILITARY FORCES AND IF CONFIRMED WOULD AGGRESSIVELY IMPLEMENT TRUMP\u2019S NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY WHICH PRIORITIZES COMPETITION WITH CHINA AND RUSSIA OVER THE COUNTERINSURGENCY WARS THAT HAVE CONSUMED THE PENTAGON FOR MUCH OF THE PAST TWO DECADES.  SHANAHAN, 56, WAS THRUST INTO THE ROLE IN AN ACTING CAPACITY IN JANUARY, AFTER JIM MATTIS ABRUPTLY RESIGNED OVER POLICY DIFFERENCES WITH TRUMP.  ON HIS FIRST DAY AS ACTING PENTAGON CHIEF IN JANUARY, SHANAHAN TOLD CIVILIAN LEADERS OF THE U.S. MILITARY TO FOCUS ON \u201cCHINA, CHINA, CHINA.\u201d  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO WITHDRAW MOST U.S. TROOPS FROM SYRIA AND DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO BRING AN END TO THE 17-YEAR-OLD WAR AFGHANISTAN.  BUT THE MOST PRESSING SHORT-TERM ISSUE IS LIKELY TO BE IRAN. EARLIER THIS WEEK THE PENTAGON SAID IT WAS SENDING A CARRIER STRIKE GROUP AND BOMBERS TO THE MIDDLE EAST AFTER U.S. INTELLIGENCE SIGNALED POSSIBLE PREPARATIONS BY TEHRAN TO STAGE ATTACKS AGAINST U.S. FORCES OR INTERESTS.  SHANAHAN IS EXPECTED TO BE CONFIRMED BY SENATORS, THOUGH HE COULD FACE A TOUGH CONFIRMATION PROCESS BECAUSE OF HIS TENURE AT BOEING.  LAWMAKERS HAVE PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT UNDUE INFLUENCE ON THE PENTAGON FROM DEFENSE COMPANIES.  TIES BETWEEN BOEING AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION RUN DEEP, WITH TRUMP USING THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS AND SITES AS A BACKDROP FOR MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS.  BOEING, THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST PLANEMAKER, IS FACING ONE OF THE BIGGEST CRISES IN ITS 103-YEAR HISTORY FOLLOWING THE DISASTERS ON LION AIR IN INDONESIA LAST YEAR AND ANOTHER ON ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES IN MARCH, WHICH TOGETHER KILLED ALL 346 ON BOARD.  THE PENTAGON INSPECTOR GENERAL STARTED THE INVESTIGATION OF SHANAHAN IN MARCH FOR ALLEGEDLY PROMOTING BOEING IN PENTAGON MEETINGS AND DISPARAGING COMPETITORS. BUT A REPORT PUBLISHED ON APRIL 25 SAID NONE OF THE ALLEGATIONS WERE SUBSTANTIATED.  DEFENSE SECRETARIES HAVE TRADITIONALLY COME FROM A POLITICAL OR POLICY BACKGROUND, SERVING AS A COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE MILITARY BRASS IN DECISION MAKING. MATTIS, A RETIRED MARINE GENERAL, WAS ONE OF THE FEW FORMER MILITARY LEADERS TO BECOME SECRETARY.  MATTIS IMPLICITLY CRITICIZED TRUMP IN HIS RESIGNATION LETTER FOR FAILING TO VALUE ALLIES WHO FIGHT ALONGSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING IN PLACES LIKE SYRIA.  SHANAHAN IS UNLIKELY TO BE AN EFFECTIVE COUNTERWEIGHT TO TRUMP\u2019S OFTEN IMPULSIVE DECISION MAKING. HE TOURED THE U.S. BORDER WITH MEXICO IN FEBRUARY IN WHAT WAS SEEN AS A SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR TRUMP\u2019S PLANNED BORDER WALL.  BOEING TIES  SHANAHAN HAS BEEN SERVING IN AN ACTING CAPACITY SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR, MAKING HIM THE LONGEST ACTING DEFENSE SECRETARY EVER. HE JOINED BOEING IN 1986 AND SPENT MORE THAN THREE DECADES THERE, WORKING ON THE 737 AND 787 DREAMLINER COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES.  SHANAHAN WAS ALSO THE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL MANAGER OF BOEING MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS AND WORKED ON THE APACHE, CHINOOK AND OSPREY MILITARY AIRCRAFT.  TRUMP HIMSELF HAS BEEN A STRONG PROPONENT OF MILITARY PRODUCTS MADE BY U.S. DEFENSE COMPANIES. IN PHONE CALLS AND PUBLIC APPEARANCES WITH WORLD LEADERS, TRUMP HAS GONE FURTHER THAN ANY OF HIS PREDECESSORS TO ACT AS A SALESMAN FOR THE U.S. DEFENSE INDUSTRY.  A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL, SPEAKING ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY, SAID SHANAHAN BELIEVED THAT HE WAS ANSWERABLE TO TRUMP AND IT WAS HIS JOB TO IMPLEMENT DECISIONS MADE BY THE PRESIDENT.

THAT LED TO THE COMPANY RECORDING 87 NET ORDERS THROUGH APRIL ACROSS ITS AIRCRAFT LINEUP, A REDUCTION OF FOUR ON A NET BASIS.

THE ADJUSTMENT HAS PUSHED THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST PLANEMAKER BEHIND EUROPEAN RIVAL AIRBUS SE IN THE RACE FOR BUSINESS THIS YEAR AS BOTH COMPANIES GRAPPLE WITH CANCELLATIONS THAT OUTWEIGH NEW ORDERS.

TUI SAID IT NEEDED CLARITY OVER THE STATUS OF ITS GROUNDED PLANES BY THE END OF MAY OR IT WILL TAKE ANOTHER HIT ON PROFIT, AND DID NOT RULE OUT CANCELLING 8 MAXS IT HAS ON ORDER.  IT POSTED AN UNDERLYING LOSS OF 300.6 MILLION EUROS, COMPARED TO A LOSS OF 168.7 MILLION EUROS THE PREVIOUS YEAR, HINDERED BY LOWER MARGINS IN SPAIN AS WELL AS THE 737 MAX GROUNDING.  \u201cALL MARKETS ARE SUFFERING COMPETITIVE PRESSURE...

JOUSSEN SAID THAT CAPACITY HAD BEEN CUT \u201cWHERE SENSIBLE\u201d, BUT TUI ALSO DIDN\u2019T WANT TO SACRIFICE MARKET SHARE.  THERE HAS BEEN A YEAR-ON-YEAR DECREASE IN BOOKINGS, TUI SAID, ALTHOUGH DEMAND TO TRAVEL TO TURKEY WAS GROWING. IT ADDED THAT WHILE AVERAGE PRICES ARE UP 1%, MARGINS ARE CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN LAST YEAR.  THE FIRM REITERATED ITS OUTLOOK FOR LOWER PROFITS, ISSUED IN MARCH AFTER BOEING SUFFERED TWO FATAL CRASHES THAT LED TO THE GROUNDING OF THE PLANE FOR ALL AIRLINES.  TUI OPERATES 15 MAXS - ONE-TENTH OF ITS FLEET. IT HAS A FURTHER 8 ON ORDER WHICH HAD BEEN DUE FOR DELIVERY IN MAY.  JOUSSEN SAID THAT THE PLANE WOULD BE ONE OF THE MOST-TESTED AIRCRAFT BY THE TIME ITS FLIGHT BAN IS LIFTED, BUT DIDN\u2019T RULE OUT CANCELLING THOSE ORDERS.  \u201cCANCELLING AND NOT TAKING DELIVERIES IS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT. FOR THE TIME BEING, WE JUST DON\u2019T TAKE THEM,\u201d JOUSSEN SAID.  \u201cWE MIGHT TAKE AEROPLANES OR NOT... I ASSUME WE WILL GET INTO A NORMAL MODUS OPERANDI, BUT THAT IS SPECULATION.\u201d  TUI SAID IT NEEDED REASSURANCES IN MAY THAT THE MAXS COULD RESUME BY MID-JULY, OR IT WOULD ACTIVATE MEASURES FOR THE SUMMER SEASON SUCH AS SUBSTITUTING PLANES THAT WOULD CUT UNDERLYING EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAX AND AMORTISATION (EBITA) BY UP TO 26% THIS YEAR.

THE 39-YEAR-OLD PLANE, LEASED BY THE LITTLE-KNOWN MEXICAN COMPANY DAMOJH TO CUBA\u2019S FLAGSHIP CARRIER CUBANA, DIVED INTO FIELDS SOUTH OF HAVANA SHORTLY AFTER TAKING OFF ON A DOMESTIC FLIGHT ON MAY 18, 2018, BURSTING INTO FLAMES.  \u201cTHE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT WERE THE ACTIONS OF THE CREW AND THEIR ERRORS IN THE CALCULATIONS OF WEIGHT AND BALANCE THAT LED TO LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE PLANE AND ITS FALL DURING THE TAKEOFF PHASE,\u201d THE CUBAN INSTITUTE OF CIVIL AERONAUTICS SAID IN A STATEMENT.  THE CREW, WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN DAMOJH\u2019S LEASE AGREEMENT WITH CUBANA, WAS MEXICAN. MOST OF THE PASSENGERS ON THE FLIGHT TO THE EASTERN CITY OF HOLGUIN WERE CUBAN.  DAMOJH HAS NOT OPERATED SINCE AT LEAST AUGUST 2018, AFTER MEXICO\u2019S CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY SUSPENDED IT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. BY THE TIME THE AGENCY FINISHED PROBING INTO THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS, DAMOJH HAD ENDED CONTRACTS TO RENT AND OPERATE ITS TWO PLANES THAT REMAINED AFTER THE CRASH.  REUTERS WAS UNABLE TO REACH THE COMPANY OR IMMEDIATELY VERIFY WHETHER IT STILL EXISTED.  BOEING CO DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REPLY TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT.  DAMOJH SAID LAST JULY THAT BLACK BOXES RETRIEVED FROM THE WRECKAGE SHOWED THE CREW HAD PILOTED IT AT A \u201cVERY STEEP ANGLE,\u201d LEADING TO A LACK OF LIFT THAT MADE THE PLANE PLUNGE AFTER TAKE-OFF.

ONE AIRLINE SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH THE PROGRAM SAID THE FLIGHT TEST SCHEDULE HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN SET AT 14 MONTHS, BUT HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY OVER AIRCRAFT CERTIFICATION AFTER TWO 737 MAX CRASHES IN OCTOBER AND MARCH MEANS THAT SCHEDULE IS UNLIKELY TO BE ACCELERATED.  THAT MEANS THE 777X IS MORE LIKELY TO BE HANDED OVER TO AIRLINES TOWARD THE END OF 2020, AND THAT DATE COULD SLIP INTO 2021, AIRLINE SOURCES SAID AT AN INDUSTRY GATHERING IN SEOUL THIS WEEK.

MUILENBURG, WHO HAS BEEN UNDER FIRE OVER THE MAX DESIGN AND BOEING\u2019S HANDLING OF THE CRISIS, SAID \u201cWE ARE SEEING OVER TIME MORE AND MORE CONVERGENCE AMONG THE REGULATORS\u201d ON WHEN THE MAX SHOULD RETURN TO SERVICE.  HE SAID HE EXPECTED THE MAX TO RETURN TO SERVICE THIS YEAR AND THAT 90% OF CUSTOMERS HAD PARTICIPATED IN SIMULATOR SESSIONS WITH ITS UPGRADED MCAS SOFTWARE AS THE COMPANY WORKS TOWARD A CERTIFICATION FLIGHT WITH REGULATORS SOON.  BOEING SAYS IT FOLLOWED LONG-STANDING ENGINEERING PROCEDURES WHEN DESIGNING THE 737 MAX. ASKED HOW THE PROCEDURES FAILED TO CAPTURE APPARENT FLAWS IN MCAS CONTROL SOFTWARE AND SENSOR ARCHITECTURE, MUILENBURG SAID: \u201cCLEARLY, WE CAN MAKE IMPROVEMENTS, AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND WE WILL MAKE THOSE IMPROVEMENTS.\u201d  HE ADDED: \u201cWHEN I MAKE COMMENTS ABOUT THE PREVIOUS MCAS DESIGN AND HOW WE FOLLOWED THOSE PROCESSES, THAT\u2019S SOMETHING WE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT AND DEPTH OF ANALYSIS INTO. THAT DOESN\u2019T MEAN THAT IT CAN\u2019T BE IMPROVED.\u201d  MUILENBURG\u2019S COMMENTS ON THE EVE OF THE PARIS AIRSHOW HIGHLIGHT EFFORTS BY BOEING TO STRIKE A DIFFERENT TONE THAN IT DID IN THE DAYS AFTER THE LION AIR CRASH IN OCTOBER, WHEN IT RAISED QUESTIONS OVER PILOT AND MAINTENANCE ISSUES.  MUILENBURG SAID THE U.S. PLANEMAKER EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE SOME ORDERS AT THE SHOW FOR WIDER-BODY JETS, BUT THAT ITS MAIN FOCUS AT THIS YEAR\u2019S INDUSTRY GATHERING WAS SAFETY.  HE FORECAST A $8.7 TRILLION MARKETPLACE FOR BOEING\u2019S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OVER 10 YEARS, UP FROM THE $8.1 TRILLION IT PROJECTED LAST YEAR, AND PREDICTED THE WORLD WOULD NEED 44,000 COMMERCIAL JETS OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS, UP FROM THE 43,000 BOEING FORECAST IN LAST YEAR\u2019S ESTIMATE.  HE STUCK TO A PREVIOUS TIMELINE FOR THE ALL-NEW 777X TWIN-AISLE JET, WHICH BOEING AIMS TO FLY LATER THIS YEAR AND DELIVER TO AIRLINES IN 2020.  HE SAID A POSSIBLE NEW JET DUBBED NMA HAD FALLEN BEHIND THE MAX\u2019S RETURN TO SERVICE AS A PRIORITY, BUT THAT THE TIMELINE ON DECISIONS AND ENTRY TO SERVICE REMAINED UNCHANGED.  HE TOOK AIM AT EUROPEAN RIVAL AIRBUS\u2019S PLANNED NEW EXTENDED-RANGE A321XLR, SAYING THE AIRCRAFT WOULD ONLY \u201cSCRATCH AN EDGE\u201d OF THE MARKET SEGMENT TARGETED BY THE NMA, WHICH WOULD REPLACE BOEING\u2019S 757S AND 767S.  WHETHER OR NOT BOEING MOVES FORWARD WITH THE NEW MID-SIZED PLANE TO SERVE A NICHE MARKET FALLING BETWEEN NARROW- AND WIDE-BODY AIRCRAFT IS EXPECTED TO RESHAPE COMPETITION WITH AIRBUS, WHICH DOMINATES THE TOP END OF THE MEDIUM-HAUL SECTOR.  ASKED WHETHER HE HAD BEEN INTERVIEWED OR SUBMITTED EVIDENCE IN AN ONGOING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION LAUNCHED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN THE WAKE OF THE 737 CRASHES, MUILENBURG SAID, \u201cWE ARE FULLY SUPPORTING ANY GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND PROVIDING INFORMATION.\u201d", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2019-06-17T00:00:00", "key": "20190617BA", "labelr0": 2.2295195298997443, "labelr1": 5.370526908988448, "labelr2": -1.4440047063857038, "labelr3": 1.714781853700888, "labelr4": -0.8109261630388446, "pos": 0.504, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.7964, "0_day_return": 2.229519529899737, "1_day_return": 2.229519529899737, "2_day_return": 3.8489715412792336, "3_day_return": 5.629754860524082, "4_day_return": 4.773175542406283, "label": 1, "return": 0.00971739982695503, "excess_return": 2.2198021300727824, "count_of_word": 597, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.52969766, "prof1": 0.47030237, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4832247257053338, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5167752742946662, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.52969766, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.47030237, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.34792852, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.6520715, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5381752, "tr_prof1": 0.4618248, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5287509, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.47124907, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.4319161, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.5680839, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.26630044, "headline_prof21": 0.73369956, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.49482653, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5051734999999999, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.53735894, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.4626411, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.6508145000000001, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.3491855, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": -2.229519529899737, "returnpredvader": 2.229519529899737, "returnpredsgd": 2.229519529899737, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0160452252253291, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9725013395101527, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0316186129549565, "cumreturn1b": 1.1566918719872068, "cumreturn1d": 0.9217415039391823, "cumreturn1e": 1.1396010865152535, "cumreturndow": 1.1523772553813514, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1294054616113565}, {"Unnamed: 0": 8105, "Unnamed: 0.1": 8105, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 8105, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 8105, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 8105, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 8105, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8105, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8105, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8105, "level_0": 8105, "index": 8105, "text": "PARIS, FRANCE (REUTERS) - BOEING SUFFERED A FRESH SETBACK AT THE OPENING OF THE PARIS AIRSHOW ON MONDAY AS THE U.S. PLANEMAKER\u2019S ENGINE SUPPLIER REVEALED A DELAY AFFECTING ITS ALL-NEW 777X JET, WHILE AIRBUS TARGETED THE MIDDLE OF THE MARKET WITH A RIVAL PLANE.  FILE PHOTO: SEVERAL BOEING 777X AIRCRAFT ARE SEEN IN VARIOUS STAGES OF PRODUCTION DURING A MEDIA TOUR OF THE BOEING 777X AT THE BOEING PRODUCTION FACILITY IN EVERETT, WASHINGTON, U.S., FEBRUARY 27, 2019. PICTURE TAKEN FEBRUARY 27, 2019. REUTERS/LINDSEY WASSON  GE AVIATION SAID IT HAD FOUND UNEXPECTED WEAR IN A COMPONENT FOR THE GE9X ENGINE IT IS MAKING FOR BOEING\u2019S 777X, THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST TWIN-ENGINED JET, FORCING A DELAY OF SEVERAL MONTHS WHILE IT REDESIGNS AND TESTS THE PART.  THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY\u2019S BIGGEST ANNUAL EVENT, WHICH ALTERNATES WITH BRITAIN\u2019S FARNBOROUGH AIRSHOW, IS TRADITIONALLY A SLUGGING MATCH BETWEEN AIRBUS AND BOEING IN THE $150 BILLION A YEAR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT MARKET.  BUT THIS YEAR BOEING IS STILL GRAPPLING WITH THE GROUNDING OF ITS TOP-SELLING 737 MAX AIRCRAFT IN MARCH AFTER TWO DEADLY CRASHES, WHILE EUROPEAN ARCH-RIVAL AIRBUS IS DEALING WITH THE FALLOUT FROM A LONG-RUNNING CORRUPTION SCANDAL.  AIRBUS USED THE SHOW TO LAUNCH A LONG-RANGE VERSION OF ITS A321NEO JET, AIMING TO CARVE OUT NEW ROUTES FOR AIRLINES WITH SMALLER PLANES AND STEAL A MARCH ON BOEING\u2019S OWNS PLANS FOR ANOTHER POTENTIAL ALL-NEW JET, THE NMA.  \u201cWE CAN FLY FROM NORTH-EASTERN ASIA INTO SOUTH ASIA, FROM THE MIDDLE EAST TO BALI OR FROM JAPAN DEEP INTO AUSTRALIA, AND SO ON,\u201d AIRBUS CHIEF SALESMAN CHRISTIAN SCHERER SAID.  \u201cIT IS THEREFORE THE LOWEST-RISK INVESTMENT FOR AIRLINES ON THESE KINDS OF ROUTES.\u201d  LEASING COMPANY AIR LEASE CORP BECAME THE FIRST CUSTOMER OF THE NEW AIRCRAFT - THE A321XLR - LINING UP FOR 27 AS PART OF A DEAL FOR 100 AIRBUS PLANES.  SOURCES FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER SAID AIRBUS WAS TRYING TO ASSEMBLE CLOSE TO 200 ORDERS OR CONVERSIONS TO THE NEW MODEL AS IT CHASES DEALS WITH CARRIERS INCLUDING AMERICAN AIRLINES, JETBLUE, CEBU AIR AND FRONTIER AIRLINES OWNER INDIGO PARTNERS.  DESPITE A FLURRY OF DELEGATES DASHING IN GOLF CARTS BETWEEN PARKED JETLINERS, MISSILES AND SPY PLANES, THIS YEAR\u2019S GATHERING APPEARED RELATIVELY SUBDUED, WITH A PROFIT WARNING FROM LUFTHANSA ADDING TO TRADE TENSIONS AND SLOWING ECONOMIES.  FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON WATCHED AS FRANCE AND GERMANY UNVEILED A SLEEK, DAGGER-SHAPED MOCKUP OF A NEW FIGHTER PLANE THE TWO CLOSE EUROPEAN ALLIES PLAN TO DEVELOP.  ANALYSTS EXPECT ANYTHING FROM 400 TO 800 COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ORDERS AND COMMITMENTS AT THE SHOW, COMPARED WITH 959 AT FARNBOROUGH LAST YEAR, THOUGH IT CAN BE HARD TO IDENTIFY TRULY NEW BUSINESS AGAINST FIRMED-UP COMMITMENTS AND SWITCHED MODELS.  BOEING COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES BOSS KEVIN MCALLISTER SAID IT WAS PREMATURE TO PREDICT ANY DELAYS TO THE 777X PROGRAM. THE PLANEMAKER IS TARGETING A MAIDEN FLIGHT THIS YEAR AND ENTRY INTO SERVICE THE NEXT.  GULF AIRLINE EMIRATES HAS SAID IT EXPECTS THE FIRST PLANE IN JUNE 2020. FLIGHT TESTS OFTEN TAKE MORE THAN A YEAR.  (FOR A GRAPHIC ON 'AIRBUS, BOEING, RAYTHEON, UTC SHARES' CLICK TMSNRT.RS/2IP8DVJ)  SIZE VS COMFORT  THE AIRBUS A321XLR WILL BE THE LONGEST-RANGE NARROW-BODY JETLINER AND ARRIVES AS AIRLINES LOOK TO MAXIMIZE THE FLEXIBILITY OF MORE FUEL-EFFICIENT, SINGLE-AISLE AIRCRAFT.  ITS RANGE OF UP TO 4,700 NAUTICAL MILES - ABOUT 15% MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS A321LR - WILL LEAPFROG THE OUT-OF-PRODUCTION BOEING 757 AND NUDGES IT INTO THE LONG-JUMP CATEGORY OCCUPIED BY MORE COSTLY WIDE-BODY JETS.  THE A321XLR ALSO EATS INTO A RANGE CATEGORY TARGETED BY THE POSSIBLE NMA MID-MARKET, TWIN-AISLE JET UNDER REVIEW BY BOEING.  \u201cIT DOES PROVIDE A VERY EFFECTIVE AIRPLANE FOR MANY OF THE SAME ROUTES AS THE NMA, AND IT DOES SO MANY YEARS EARLIER,\u201d AIR LEASE CEO JOHN PLUEGER SAID OF THE NEW AIRBUS JET.  BUT THERE IS A DEBATE OVER WHETHER PASSENGERS WILL ENJOY FLYING LONGER DISTANCES IN MEDIUM-HAUL PLANES.  AIRBUS DID NOT GIVE A PRICE FOR THE A321XLR. THE CURRENT A321NEO HAS A LIST PRICE OF $129.5 MILLION.  BOEING CHAIRMAN AND CEO DENNIS MUILENBURG ON SUNDAY SAID THE A321XLR WOULD ONLY \u201cSCRATCH AN EDGE\u201d OF THE MARKET SEGMENT TARGETED BY THE NMA. BUT AIR LEASE FOUNDER STEVEN UDVAR-HAZY, A DOYEN OF THE LEASING INDUSTRY, SAID THE NMA PROJECT REMAINED \u201cA LITTLE BIT IN COLD STORAGE\u201d AS LONG AS THE MAX GROUNDING LASTED.  HE ADDED THAT BOEING EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE ORDERS FOR WIDE-BODY JETS AT THE PARIS SHOW BUT ITS MAIN FOCUS AT THE EVENT WAS SAFETY, WITH EXECUTIVES TAKING TURNS TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE MAX CRASHES IN INDONESIA AND ETHIOPIA THAT KILLED 346 PEOPLE.  \u201cTHIS IS THE MOST TRYING OF TIMES,\u201d BOEING\u2019S MCALLISTER TOLD A PRESS BRIEFING.  \u201cBUT WITHOUT A DOUBT THIS IS A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR ALL OF US.

WRAPPING UP THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST AIR SHOW ON THURSDAY, AIRBUS PUBLICLY VOICED ITS FRUSTRATION OVER THE DEAL AND URGED IAG TO RUN A COMPETITION FOR THE PLANES, WHICH WOULD BE DEPLOYED AT VUELING, IBERIA, AER LINGUS, LEVEL AND PART OF BA.  \u201cWE WOULD LIKE A CHANCE TO COMPETE FOR THAT BUSINESS,\u201d CHIEF COMMERCIAL OFFICER CHRISTIAN SCHERER TOLD REPORTERS, ADDING THAT IAG HAD NOT ISSUED A FORMAL TENDER FOR THE NARROW-BODY ORDER.  IAG WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT, BUT SAID EARLIER IN THE WEEK THAT IT DID NOT COMMENT ON NEGOTIATIONS.  BOEING DECLINED COMMENT.  FRAYED TRUCE  THE SHOCK ANNOUNCEMENT OF A TENTATIVE ORDER FOR 200 737 MAX JETS FROM IAG STUNNED THE INDUSTRY AND FRAYED AN UNUSUAL PR TRUCE BETWEEN THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST PLANEMAKERS AFTER AIRBUS HAD PUBLICLY SUPPORTED BOEING OVER THE GROUNDING.  COMMERCIAL RIVALRY REMAINS FIERCE, WITH AIRBUS LAUNCHING ITS A321XLR - A LONGER-RANGE VERSION OF ITS A321 - TO TRY TO REDUCE THE SPACE LEFT FOR BOEING AS IT DRAWS UP DESIGNS FOR A NEW 220-270-SEATER IN THE SO-CALLED MIDDLE OF THE JET MARKET.  AIRBUS REPORTED 383 ORDERS AND COMMITMENTS INCLUDING 239 FOR THE A321XLR. BOEING\u2019S FIRM AND TENTATIVE ORDERS CAME TO 247. BOTH ARE SUFFERING FROM SLOWER IN DEMAND AFTER A LONG UPSWING.

REUTERS/MATT MILLS MCKNIGHT/FILE PHOTO - RC1BB9F46A00  SHARES IN BOTH COMPANIES ROSE LESS THAN 1 PERCENT.  AIRBUS ANNOUNCED A LAST-MINUTE ORDER FOR 13 OF THE XLR JETS FROM U.S. BUDGET CARRIER JETBLUE AIRWAYS, WHICH IS EXPANDING INTO THE CUT-THROAT TRANSATLANTIC MARKET, JOINING A VARIED LIST OF BACKERS INCLUDING AMERICAN AIRLINES.  AIRBUS HOPES TO DERAIL BOEING\u2019S PLANS FOR A MID-MARKET JET IN A GAP BETWEEN TRADITIONAL NARROW-BODY AND WIDE-BODY JETS BY DOMINATING THE LOWER END, WHERE ITS A321 OUTSELLS BOEING.  BUT IT IS MORE VULNERABLE AT THE TOP END WHERE ITS A330NEO WIDE-BODY JET IS UP AGAINST TOUGH COMPETITION FROM THE NEWER BOEING 787. AIRBUS GRABBED KEY ORDERS FROM PHILIPPINES CARRIER CEBU AIR AND VIRGIN ATLANTIC, WHILE KOREAN AIR TOOK 20 787S.  YET THE BIGGEST ISSUE HOVERING OVER THE SHOW WAS THE GROUNDING OF THE MAX, WHICH SECURES SUPPLIER PROFITS FOR THE NEXT DECADE, WHILE ON THE DEFENSE SIDE OF THE SHOW A FRANCO-GERMAN PAIRING AND TURKEY EACH UNVEILED NEW FIGHTER DESIGNS.  THE IAG DEAL MARKED A PSYCHOLOGICAL TURNING POINT FOR THE FIVE-DECADE-OLD 737 SERIES THOUGH BOEING AVOIDED WADING INTO THE TRADITIONAL DING-DONG WITH AIRBUS OVER WHO WON THE SHOW, AS IT STRIKES A MORE SOMBER TONE THAN USUAL FOLLOWING THE CRASHES.  BOEING DID, HOWEVER, SAY IT WAS IN TALKS WITH OTHER AIRLINES FOR SALES OF ITS 737 MAX AFTER THE IAG DEAL.  SLIDESHOW (2 IMAGES)  SENIOR VICE-PRESIDENT IHSSANE MOUNIR DISMISSED THE A321XLR AS SUITABLE FOR ONLY A \u201cSLIVER\u201d OF THE MARKET THAT BOEING HOPES TO WIN WITH ITS PROPOSED ALL-NEW MID-MARKET PLANE.  THE TWO SIDES ALSO TRADED BLOWS OVER COMPETITION FOR WIDE-BODY JETS, WITH EACH SCORING KEY WINS IN ASIA.  BOEING HAD OPENED THE SHOW ON A SUBDUED NOTE WITH APOLOGIES OVER LIVES LOST IN THE MAX CRASHES. IT SUFFERED A FURTHER SETBACK WHEN GENERAL ELECTRIC DISCLOSED A DELAY OF MONTHS IN SUPPLYING ENGINES FOR THE NEW 777X WIDE-BODY AIRCRAFT.  MOUNIR SAID HE STILL EXPECTED THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST TWIN-ENGINED PLANE TO FLY THIS YEAR AND TO BE DELIVERED IN 2020.", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2019-06-20T00:00:00", "key": "20190620BA", "labelr0": 1.714781853700888, "labelr1": -0.8109261630388446, "labelr2": 0.5782056798623156, "labelr3": -1.2486964892109458, "labelr4": 1.5217155854001962, "pos": 0.29100000000000004, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.4767, "0_day_return": 1.7147818537008863, "1_day_return": -0.8109261630388498, "2_day_return": -0.2374093043107206, "3_day_return": -1.4831412718736785, "4_day_return": 0.016005121638906772, "label": -1, "return": -0.0012592228928593196, "excess_return": -0.8096669401459905, "count_of_word": 734, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.30964990000000003, "prof1": 0.69035006, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4952596050391038, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5047403949608962, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.30964990000000003, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.69035006, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.37077576, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.6292241999999999, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.46283653, "tr_prof1": 0.5371634, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5407466, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.45925343, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.543655, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.456345, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.5625875, "headline_prof21": 0.43741247, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.34126273, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.65873724, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.3365634, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.6634366, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.4185092000000001, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.5814908000000001, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": -0.8109261630388498, "returnpredvader": -0.8109261630388498, "returnpredsgd": -0.8109261630388498, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9930215304660033, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9927135360735027, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9987143940341039, "cumreturn1b": 1.157630397838853, "cumreturn1d": 0.929764703366813, "cumreturn1e": 1.1630262209124795, "cumreturndow": 1.1652961878055863, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1402273820997488}, {"Unnamed: 0": 8452, "Unnamed: 0.1": 8452, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 8452, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 8452, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 8452, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 8452, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8452, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8452, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8452, "level_0": 8452, "index": 8452, "text": "MONTREAL (REUTERS) - AIRLINES AND REGULATORS ARE GATHERING AT A CLOSED-DOOR SUMMIT IN MONTREAL ON WEDNESDAY TO EXCHANGE VIEWS ON STEPS NEEDED FOR A SAFE AND COORDINATED RETURN OF BOEING CO\u2019S GROUNDED 737 MAX JETS TO THE SKIES FOLLOWING TWO DEADLY CRASHES.

REUTERS/LINDSEY WASSON/FILE PHOTO  THE MEETING, ORGANIZED BY INDUSTRY TRADE GROUP THE INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION (IATA), COMES AS AIRLINES GRAPPLE WITH THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF A GLOBAL GROUNDING OF NEARLY 400 737 MAX JETS THAT HAS LASTED THREE MONTHS.  BOEING, THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST PLANEMAKER, HAS YET TO FORMALLY SUBMIT PROPOSED 737 MAX SOFTWARE AND TRAINING UPDATES TO THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA), WHICH WILL KICK-START A RE-CERTIFICATION PROCESS THAT COULD TAKE WEEKS.  IATA DIRECTOR GENERAL ALEXANDRE DE JUNIAC HAS SAID \u201cSHORING UP TRUST AMONG REGULATORS AND IMPROVING COORDINATION\u201d WITHIN AN INDUSTRY THAT GROUNDED THE MAX PLANES ON DIFFERENT DATES IN MARCH WOULD BE PRIORITIES AT WEDNESDAY\u2019S SUMMIT.  IT IS THE SECOND SUCH MEETING ORGANIZED BY IATA.

REGULATORS INCLUDING TRANSPORT CANADA, THE CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE AND THE FAA WILL JOIN AIRLINES AT THE MEETING, REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE AUTHORITIES TOLD REUTERS.  ONCE REGULATORS APPROVE THE MAX FOR FLIGHT, AIRLINES MUST REMOVE THE JETS FROM STORAGE AND IMPLEMENT NEW PILOT TRAINING, A PROCESS THAT WILL DIFFER FOR EACH AIRLINE BUT THAT U.S. CARRIERS HAVE SAID WILL TAKE AT LEAST ONE MONTH.

WHEN THE MAX RETURNS TO THE SKIES, WITH THE UPDATED SOFTWARE AND REQUIRED TRAINING, IT WILL BE ONE OF THE SAFEST AIRPLANES EVER TO FLY,\u201d BOEING SPOKESMAN PAUL BERGMAN SAID.  BOEING\u2019S SOFTWARE FIX IS MEANT TO MAKE A SYSTEM KNOWN AS MCAS, WHICH PLAYED A ROLE IN BOTH CRASHES, LESS POWERFUL.  STILL, AIR CANADA HAS SAID ITS 400 MAX PILOTS, ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF ITS PILOT FORCE, WILL TRAIN IN THE SIMULATOR. AIR CANADA IS THE ONLY NORTH AMERICAN CARRIER THAT CURRENTLY OWNS THE MAX SIMULATOR.

BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ BERGER & GROSSMANN, FOR ITS PART, SAYS THE FAMILY\u2019S ASSERTION IS \u201cIMPLAUSIBLE.\u201d IT REACHED THAT CONCLUSION AFTER FIRM INVESTIGATORS STAKED OUT THE NEVADA FAMILY\u2019S HOMES AND PEPPERED THEIR FRIENDS AND COWORKERS WITH PHONE CALLS.  ACCORDING TO BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ\u2019S BRIEF, PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE NEVADA FAMILY - A RETIREE WHO LIVES HALF OF THE YEAR IN SHANGHAI, AN OFFICE WORKER IN THE STATE\u2019S PEST CONTROL BUREAU, AND A CASINO EMPLOYEE WHO MOONLIGHTS FOR A PEST CONTROL COMPANY \u2013 \u201cEXPRESSED DISBELIEF\u201d ABOUT THE FAMILY\u2019S CLAIM TO HAVE INVESTED MORE THAN $40 MILLION IN BOEING STOCK.  THE FAMILY\u2019S LAWYERS, MEANWHILE, ACCUSED BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ OF TRYING TO SCARE OFF THE NEVADA FAMILY IN ORDER TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR ITS CLIENT, THE MISSISSIPPI PUBLIC EMPLOYEES\u2019 RETIREMENT SYSTEM. KAHN SWICK & FOTI ARGUED IN ITS BRIEF THAT BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ AND MISSPERS ARE SO DESPERATE TO RUN THE BOEING CASE THAT THEY HIRED INVESTIGATORS \"TO HARASS AND STALK\" THEIR RIVAL LEAD PLAINTIFF CANDIDATES.  BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ PARTNER GERALD SILK AND KAHN SWICK PARTNER RAMZI ABADOU BOTH DECLINED TO PROVIDE STATEMENTS RESPONDING TO THE OTHER\u2019S ALLEGATIONS.  KAHN SWICK CLIENTS KATHLEEN WANG AND KENNETH WANG JR, DID NOT RESPOND TO EMAILS REQUESTING COMMENT. BOEING LAWYERS FROM KIRKLAND & ELLIS ALSO DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT.  IN SELECTING LEAD PLAINTIFFS FOR SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTIONS, JUDGES USUALLY LOOK FIRST AT THE MAGNITUDE OF AN INVESTOR\u2019S LOSSES. WITH THE BIGGEST LOSSES OF ANY OF THE FIVE INVESTORS THAT ASKED TO LEAD THE BOEING CASE, THE WANGS CURRENTLY HAVE AN EDGE.  MISSPERS HAS SAID IT LOST ABOUT $2.5 MILLION IN ITS BOEING STAKE, THE SECOND LARGEST CLAIMED LOSS.  IT\u2019S NOT AT ALL UNUSUAL FOR LAW FIRMS TO FIGHT OVER WHOSE CLIENT WILL WIN APPOINTMENT TO LEAD SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTIONS. THE INVESTOR SELECTED AS A LEAD PLAINTIFF TYPICALLY PICKS THE LAWYERS WHO WILL SERVE AS LEAD COUNSEL. THOSE LAWYERS, IN TURN, ARE ENTITLED TO THE LION\u2019S SHARE OF COURT-AWARDED FEES IF THE CASE SETTLES. BOEING LOST TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MARKET CAPITALIZATION AFTER ITS 737 MAX PLANES WERE GROUNDED, MAKING IT AN ATTRACTIVE TARGET FOR SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION.  THE BOEING LEADERSHIP FIGHT, HOWEVER, IS UNUSUAL - BOTH IN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE LOSSES CLAIMED BY THE NEVADA FAMILY AND THE FEROCITY OF BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ\u2019S INVESTIGATION OF THE FAMILY\u2019S CLAIMS.  KAHN SWICK\u2019S CLIENTS - KENNETH AND KATHLEEN WANG AND THEIR ADULT SON, KENNETH WANG JR - CERTIFIED IN A FILING IN FEDERAL COURT IN CHICAGO THAT THEY PURCHASED MORE THAN $40 MILLION IN BOEING STOCK IN THE MONTHS PRECEDING THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH AND THE GROUNDING OF 737 MAX PLANES. WANG FAMILY MEMBERS SOMETIMES PURCHASED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u2019 WORTH OF SHARES IN A SINGLE DAY. THE FAMILY ALLEGES THAT THE VALUE OF ITS STAKE DROPPED BY $4.7 MILLION AS THE MARKET RESPONDED TO BAD NEWS ABOUT THE 737 MAX JETS.  BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ SAYS THE WANGS\u2019 CERTIFICATION DOES NOT INDICATE SALES OF BOEING SHARES \u2013 AN \u201cUNUSUAL\u201d TRADING PATTERN, GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE WANGS\u2019 INVESTMENT. ACCORDING TO BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ\u2019S ANALYSIS, THE WANGS CLAIM TO HAVE BOUGHT MORE BOEING SHARES AND LOST MORE MONEY THAN CHARLES SCHWAB, TD ASSET MANAGEMENT AND OPPENHEIMER, WHICH COLLECTIVELY MANAGE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  DESPITE BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ\u2019S SUSPICIONS ABOUT THE WANGS\u2019 TRADING, THE FIRM INITIALLY ATTEMPTED TO TEAM UP WITH THE FAMILY, SUGGESTING THAT THE WANGS AND MISSPERS MOVE JOINTLY TO LEAD THE BOEING CASE.(SEVERAL OTHER INVESTORS, INCLUDING A CANADIAN PENSION FUND, HAVE ALSO ASKED TO BE APPOINTED LEAD PLAINTIFFS, THOUGH NONE HAVE LOSSES AS LARGE AS EITHER THE WANGS OR MISSPERS.)  WHEN KAHN SWICK AND THE WANGS TURNED DOWN BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ\u2019S INVITATION TO JOIN FORCES, KAHN SWICK SAID BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ BROUGHT IN A TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS TO VET THE WANGS\u2019 CLAIMS. INVESTIGATORS RAN DOWN THE WANGS\u2019 FINANCIAL RECORDS IN THE U.S. AND CHINA, WHICH ISN\u2019T OUT OF THE ORDINARY IN SECURITIES CLASS ACTIONS.  BUT ACCORDING TO KAHN SWICK\u2019S FILINGS, BERNSTEIN DIDN\u2019T STOP THERE. INVESTIGATORS HIRED BY THE FIRM PARKED OUTSIDE THE WANG RESIDENCES AND MADE \u201cREPEATED PHONE CALLS TO THEIR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES, WORK COLLEAGUES, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS,\u201d PROBING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE APPARENTLY MODEST FAMILY COULD HAVE AMASSED A $40 MILLION INVESTMENT IN BOEING. BERNSTEIN INVESTIGATORS CALLED KENNY WANG\u2019S BOSS AT THE PEST CONTROL COMPANY AND HIS GIRLFRIEND\u2019S SISTER. THEY EVEN, ACCORDING TO KAHN SWICK, ENTERED THE HOME OF ONE OF KATHLEEN WANG\u2019S NEIGHBORS FOR AN INTERVIEW IN PERSON.  KAHN SWICK FILED A MOTION TO CURTAIL BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ\u2019S INVESTIGATION. U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE JOHN THARP OF CHICAGO DENIED THAT MOTION ON JULY 3, RULING THAT BOTH SIDES SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE PROPRIETY OF THE INVESTIGATION. THE WANGS' LAWYERS ALSO WENT TO NEVADA STATE COURT TO ASK FOR AN ORDER OF PROTECTION AGAINST BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ INVESTIGATORS. THAT MOTION IS SCHEDULED FOR A HEARING NEXT WEEK.  BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ SUGGESTED IN THE BRIEF IT FILED FRIDAY THAT THE INVESTIGATION VINDICATED ITS SUSPICIONS ABOUT THE WANGS\u2019 REPORTED BOEING INVESTMENT. KATHLEEN AND KENNETH WANG, SR, APPEAR TO HAVE NO PROPERTY EXCEPT FOR A HOME VALUED AT ABOUT $685,000 AND TWO CARS WORTH ABOUT $30,000. KENNETH WANG JR HAS A $385,000 HOUSE AND TWO CARS, THE FIRM SAID. HE AND HIS MOTHER BOTH APPEAR TO EARN ABOUT $60,000 A YEAR AT THEIR JOBS, ACCORDING TO THE BRIEF.  THE OWNER OF THE PEST CONTROL COMPANY WHERE THE SON IS EMPLOYED, WHO DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS A LONGTIME FAMILY FRIEND, TOLD BERNSTEIN INVESTIGATORS THERE WAS NO WAY THE WANGS HAD INVESTED $40 MILLION. HE DESCRIBED THE WANGS AS \u201cREGULAR WORKING PEOPLE\u201d AND CALLED THE ASSERTION THAT THEY HAD TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INVESTMENTS \u201cWRONG\u201d AND \u201cA LIE,\u201d ACCORDING TO THE BERNSTEIN BRIEF.  BERNSTEIN SAID THAT IN A CASE AS IMPORTANT AS THE BOEING SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION, JUDGE THARP CANNOT APPOINT LEAD INVESTORS WITH A CLOUD OVER THEIR HEADS. KAHN SWICK RESPONDED THAT IF THE JUDGE HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WANGS\u2019 TRADES, THE FAMILY WILL SHOW THE JUDGE BACKUP DOCUMENTS DETAILING THE TRANSACTIONS, EVEN THOUGH SUCH BACKUP IS NOT NECESSARY UNDER THE GUIDELINES FOR SECURITIES SUITS.  THE OTHER INVESTORS BIDDING TO LEAD THE CASE SEEM TO BE HOPING JUDGE THARP DECIDES THAT BOTH THE WANGS AND MISSPERS ARE TOO COMPROMISED TO REPRESENT ALL BOEING INVESTORS. THE NEXT ROUND OF BRIEFS IS DUE ON AUG. 2.

FILE PHOTO: AN AMERICAN AIRLINES BOEING 737 MAX 8 FLIGHT FROM LOS ANGELES APPROACHES FOR LANDING AT REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT SHORTLY AFTER AN ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE BY THE FAA THAT THE PLANES WERE BEING GROUNDED BY THE UNITED STATES OVER SAFETY ISSUES IN WASHINGTON, U.S. MARCH 13, 2019. REUTERS/JOSHUA ROBERTS/FILE PHOTO  \u201cIT\u2019S REALLY ALL ABOUT THE MAX. IT\u2019S THE ONLY THING WE\u2019RE DEALING WITH,\u201d SOUTHWEST CHIEF EXECUTIVE GARY KELLY TOLD INVESTORS AFTER TAKING A $175 MILLION HIT TO OPERATING INCOME IN THE SECOND QUARTER FROM THE MAX GROUNDING.  \u201cEVERYTHING ELSE IS ROCK SOLID,\u201d KELLY SAID, POINTING TO RISING REVENUES AND COST MANAGEMENT, EXCLUDING COSTS RELATED TO ROUGHLY 150 DAILY FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS AS THE AIRLINE MANAGES ITS OPERATIONS WITH A SLIMMER FLEET.  THOSE COSTS ARE SET TO RISE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, THE AIRLINE SAID.  SOUTHWEST AND AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC (AAL.O) ARE THE TWO LARGEST U.S. MAX OPERATORS, WITH 34 AND 24 JETS RESPECTIVELY AND DOZENS MORE ON ORDER. CARRIERS THAT RUSHED TO BUY BOEING\u2019S FUEL-EFFICIENT JETS TO OPEN NEW AND LONGER ROUTES HAVE BEEN REELING FROM A GLOBAL GROUNDING IN MARCH THAT FOLLOWED TWO FATAL CRASHES IN ETHIOPIA AND INDONESIA.  AMERICAN, THE NO. 1 U.S. AIRLINE, SAID IT EXPECTED THE GROUNDING TO HIT ITS 2019 PRE-TAX EARNINGS BY ABOUT $400 MILLION, ABOUT $50 MILLION MORE THAN IT HAD PREVIOUSLY FORECAST.  THE TIMING OF THE MAX\u2019S RETURN TO SERVICE IS STILL UNCERTAIN.  THE ACTING ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, WHICH MUST APPROVE BOEING\u2019S SOFTWARE FIXES AND NEW PILOT TRAINING BEFORE THE MAX CAN FLY AGAIN, SAID ON THURSDAY THE TIMELINE WOULD BE DRIVEN BY ONE CRITERIA: SAFETY.  BASED ON GUIDANCE FROM BOEING, SOUTHWEST EXTENDED MAX-RELATED CANCELLATIONS UNTIL JAN. 5, 2020, SAYING IT WILL NEED ONE TO TWO MONTHS FOLLOWING REGULATORY APPROVAL TO TRAIN PILOTS AND PREPARE THE JETS FOR FRESH COMMERCIAL SERVICE.  IT HAD PREVIOUSLY REMOVED THE MAX JETS FROM ITS FLYING SCHEDULE THROUGH EARLY NOVEMBER, A TIMELINE THAT AMERICAN MAINTAINED ON THURSDAY, DESPITE SKEPTICISM BY ANALYSTS.  SHARES IN AMERICAN WERE DOWN ABOUT 4.7% ON THURSDAY WHILE SOUTHWEST GAINED 1.6%, RECOVERING FROM OPENING LOSSES.  SCRAMBLING TO GROW  LACKING PLANES, SOUTHWEST SAID IT WAS FREEZING NEW PILOT HIRES AND UPGRADES AND CEASING SERVICE FROM UNDERPERFORMING NEWARK, WHERE IT HAD UP TO 20 DAILY DEPARTURES, TO CONSOLIDATE ITS NEW YORK CITY SERVICE AT NEARBY LAGUARDIA IN EARLY NOVEMBER.  HOWEVER, THE AIRLINE IS RESUMING ITS GROWTH PLANS IN CALIFORNIA AND HAWAII NEXT MONTH, KELLY SAID. THE AIRLINE CANNOT AFFORD COMPETITIVELY TO WAIT ANY LONGER, HE SAID.  THE LOW-COST CARRIER LAUNCHED HAWAII FLIGHTS THIS YEAR. TO HELP SERVICE THAT EXPANSION, IT IS DELAYING THE RETIREMENT OF SEVEN 737-700 AIRCRAFT.  STILL, SOUTHWEST SAID ITS FLYING CAPACITY WILL NOW FALL BY AS MUCH AS 2% THIS YEAR, A REVERSAL FROM ITS EARLIER FORECAST OF 5% GROWTH. AMERICAN\u2019S CAPACITY WILL STILL GROW IN 2019, THE AIRLINE SAID, BUT AT A SLOWER RATE THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED.  BOTH SOUTHWEST AND AMERICAN SAID THEY HAVE HELD DISCUSSIONS WITH BOEING ABOUT MAX-RELATED DAMAGES BUT HAVE NOT REACHED ANY CONCLUSIONS.

THE TESTS INDICATE THE FAA IS MAKING PROGRESS IN THE RE-APPROVAL PROCESS OF THE MAX FOR COMMERCIAL FLIGHT. BOEING CO\u2019S LATEST 737 NARROWBODY MODEL, THE MAX, WAS GROUNDED WORLDWIDE IN MARCH FOLLOWING TWO FATAL CRASHES IN INDONESIA AND ETHIOPIA THAT KILLED 346 PEOPLE WITHIN FIVE MONTHS.  SINCE THEN, AIRLINES THAT RUSHED TO BUY THE MAX TO SERVICE NEW AND LONGER ROUTES WITH THE JET\u2019S FUEL-EFFICIENT ENGINES HAVE HAD TO CANCEL THOUSANDS OF FLIGHTS AS THEY MANAGE SLIMMER FLEETS, EATING INTO THEIR PROFITABILITY.  BOEING, THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST PLANEMAKER, HAS SAID IT IS WORKING TOWARD GETTING THE 737 MAX FLYING AGAIN COMMERCIALLY IN THE EARLY FOURTH QUARTER, ONCE THE FAA APPROVES NEW PILOT TRAINING AND REPROGRAMMED SOFTWARE FOR A STALL-PREVENTION SYSTEM AT THE CENTER OF BOTH CRASHES.  AS PART OF ITS OWN TESTING PROCESS BOEING HAS INVITED SENIOR U.S. AIRLINE PILOTS TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE SOFTWARE FIX AND USE SIMULATORS TO RUN SCENARIOS SIMILAR TO THE ONES THAT LED TO THE TWO CRASHES. BUT THE FAA WANTS TO OBSERVE RELATIVELY INEXPERIENCED 737 PILOTS, THE SOURCES SAID ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY BECAUSE THE TESTS ARE CONFIDENTIAL.  TO DO SO, THE FAA ASKED SOUTHWEST AIRLINES, AMERICAN AIRLINES AND UNITED AIRLINES - THE THREE U.S. CARRIERS THAT OPERATE THE MAX - TO PROVIDE THE NAMES OF NEWER 737 LINE PILOTS WHO HAVE FLOWN THE MAX AT LEAST ONCE, THEY SAID.  THE EXACT NATURE OF THE TESTS, WHICH THEY SAID IS LIKELY A FIRST STEP TOWARD CREATING A WIDER TEST GROUP, WAS STILL BEING DECIDED BUT COULD INCLUDE A SCENARIO DISCOVERED BY THE FAA IN JUNE THAT SHOWED A MICROPROCESSOR FLAW CAUSING AN UNCOMMANDED MOVEMENT OF THE PLANE\u2019S HORIZONTAL TAIL WHICH TOOK TEST CREW TOO LONG TO RECOGNIZE AS A LOSS OF CONTROL KNOWN AS RUNAWAY STABILIZER.  ONE SOURCE SAID THE TEST WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CONDUCTED DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER BUT HAS BEEN PUSHED BACK TO THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH.  BOEING DECLINED TO COMMENT WHILE THE FAA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY COMMENT.  THE CHICAGO-BASED PLANEMAKER STARTED DELIVERING THE MAX, ITS FASTEST-SELLING AIRCRAFT, IN 2017 BEFORE MORE THAN 50 AIRLINES WORLDWIDE WERE FORCED TO PARK SOME 380 JETS.  SINCE APRIL BOEING HAS BEEN RUNNING RIGOROUS ROUNDS OF TEST FLIGHTS WITH THE NEW SOFTWARE, BOTH IN FLIGHT SIMULATORS AND IN THE AIR, AS IT LOOKS TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF ITS BEST-SELLING AIRCRAFT, WITH ABOUT 5,000 PENDING ORDERS.  SOUTHWEST, THE LARGEST MAX OPERATOR WITH 34 JETS, HAS REMOVED THE AIRCRAFT FROM ITS FLIGHT SCHEDULING UNTIL EARLY 2020, WHILE AMERICAN AND UNITED HAVE SCHEDULED WITHOUT THE MAX UNTIL EARLY NOVEMBER, LEADING TO HUNDREDS OF DAILY FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS.  THE LONGER THE GROUNDING LASTS, THE HARSHER THE IMPACT ON AIRLINES THAT HAVE BEEN AWAITING NEW MAX DELIVERIES.  SEPARATELY, SOURCES TOLD REUTERS THAT BOEING PLANS TO RESUME PRODUCTION OF 737 JETS AT A RATE OF 52 AIRCRAFT PER MONTH IN FEBRUARY 2020. IT REDUCED THE NUMBER OF 737S IT PRODUCES MONTHLY TO 42 FROM 52 WHEN MAX DELIVERIES WERE FROZEN IN APRIL, CUTTING OFF A KEY SOURCE OF CASH AND HITTING MARGINS.

FILE PHOTO: A WORKER WALKS PAST UNPAINTED BOEING 737 MAX AIRCRAFT SEEN PARKED IN AN AERIAL PHOTO AT RENTON MUNICIPAL AIRPORT NEAR THE BOEING RENTON FACILITY IN RENTON, WASHINGTON, U.S. JULY 1, 2019. REUTERS/LINDSEY WASSON/FILE PHOTO  EARLIER, REUTERS REPORTED THAT THE AGENCY HAD ASKED THE THREE U.S. AIRLINES THAT OPERATE THE MAX TO PROVIDE THE NAMES OF SOME PILOTS WHO HAD ONLY FLOWN THE 737 FOR AROUND A YEAR, INCLUDING AT LEAST ONE MAX FLIGHT.  IN A STATEMENT, THE FAA SAID IT HAD NOT SPECIFIED THE NUMBER OF REQUIRED HOURS OF FLIGHT EXPERIENCE, BUT SAID THE CANDIDATES WOULD BE A CROSS-SECTION OF LINE PILOTS AND MUST HAVE EXPERIENCE AT THE CONTROLS OF THE MAX.  BOEING CO\u2019S (BA.N) LATEST 737 NARROW-BODY MODEL, THE MAX, WAS GROUNDED WORLDWIDE IN MARCH AFTER TWO CRASHES WITHIN FIVE MONTHS IN INDONESIA AND ETHIOPIA THAT KILLED 346 PEOPLE.  BOEING HAS BEEN REPROGRAMMING SOFTWARE FOR A STALL-PREVENTION SYSTEM AT THE CENTER OF BOTH CRASHES, WHICH THE FAA MUST APPROVE BEFORE THE PLANE FLIES AGAIN COMMERCIALLY.  THE FAA SAID IT HAD NOT YET SPECIFIED A FIRM SCHEDULE FOR THE TESTS.  BOEING HAS SAID IT IS WORKING TOWARD GETTING THE 737 MAX FLYING AGAIN COMMERCIALLY IN THE EARLY FOURTH QUARTER. REUTERS REPORTED ON THURSDAY THAT IT HAD TOLD SUPPLIERS IT PLANNED TO RAMP 737 PRODUCTION BACK UP IN FEBRUARY, SENDING ITS SHARES 4% HIGHER.  THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST PLANEMAKER SLOWED ITS 737 PRODUCTION RATE IN APRIL BECAUSE DELIVERIES OF THE MAX, WHICH MAKES UP THE BULK OF ITS SINGLE-AISLE PRODUCTION, WERE FROZEN UNDER THE GROUNDING, HITTING ITS SUPPLY CHAIN AND AIRLINE CUSTOMERS.  IN THE UNITED STATES, MAX OPERATORS SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO (LUV.N), AMERICAN AIRLINES (AAL.O) AND UNITED AIRLINES (UAL.O) HAVE HAD TO CANCEL HUNDREDS OF DAILY FLIGHTS AS THEY WRESTLE WITH SLIMMER FLEETS AT A TIME OF STRONG DOMESTIC AIR TRAVEL DEMAND.  THE MAX IS BOEING\u2019S FASTEST-SELLING AIRCRAFT, WITH ABOUT 5,000 PENDING ORDERS.  AS PART OF ITS OWN TESTING PROCESS, BOEING HAS INVITED SENIOR AIRLINE PILOTS TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE SOFTWARE FIX AND USE SIMULATORS TO RUN SCENARIOS SIMILAR TO THE ONES THAT LED TO THE TWO CRASHES.  BUT SOURCES TOLD REUTERS THAT THE FAA ALSO WANTED TO OBSERVE NEWER 737 PILOTS. ONE SOURCE SAID THE SIMULATOR TESTS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE CONDUCTED DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER BUT HAD BEEN PUSHED BACK TO THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH.  THE FAA, WHICH IS WORKING ALONGSIDE GLOBAL REGULATORS, HAS SAID REPEATEDLY IT DOES NOT HAVE A FIXED TIME LINE TO APPROVE THE GROUNDED JETS TO FLY COMMERCIALLY AGAIN.", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2019-08-23T00:00:00", "key": "20190823BA", "labelr0": 0.4514545300640405, "labelr1": 0.8510996882110137, "labelr2": -1.200423351158646, "labelr3": 1.477179826910611, "labelr4": 0.7695085701586192, "pos": 0.118, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.1531, "0_day_return": 0.4514545300640327, "1_day_return": 0.4514545300640327, "2_day_return": -0.3595404623465415, "3_day_return": 1.1123283053847022, "4_day_return": 1.8903963371815544, "label": 1, "return": 0.010982987950876478, "excess_return": 0.4404715421131562, "count_of_word": 460, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.37950847, "prof1": 0.62049156, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4761023105060697, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5238976894939303, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.37950847, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.62049156, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.34698316, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.65301687, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.46182007, "tr_prof1": 0.53818, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.4846272, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.5153728, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5247248000000001, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.47527525, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.42536795, "headline_prof21": 0.57463205, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.35548967, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.6445104, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.30419713, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.69580287, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.57569164, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.42430829999999997, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": 0.4514545300640327, "returnpredvader": 0.4514545300640327, "returnpredsgd": 0.4514545300640327, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0045145453006403, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0045145453006403, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0045145453006403, "cumreturn1b": 1.4063044075016502, "cumreturn1d": 0.8021727417737748, "cumreturn1e": 1.3652261341782546, "cumreturndow": 1.1368278671978187, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1052214001690541}, {"Unnamed: 0": 11014, "Unnamed: 0.1": 11014, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 11014, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 11014, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 11014, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 11014, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 11014, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 11014, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 11014, "level_0": 11014, "index": 11014, "text": "FILE PHOTO: A LOGO OF LOW COST CARRIER SPIRIT AIRLINES IS PICTURED ON AN AIRBUS PLANE IN COLOMIERS NEAR TOULOUSE, FRANCE, NOVEMBER 6, 2018.

BUT TIT-FOR-TAT TARIFFS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA, WHICH IS POISED TO OVERTAKE THE UNITED STATES AS THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST AVIATION MARKET IN THE NEXT DECADE, HAVE SLOWED THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND FORCED BOEING TO WALK A GEOPOLITICAL TIGHTROPE FOR MORE THAN A YEAR.  ON THE ONE HAND, BOEING HAS BEEN INCREASING ITS INDUSTRIAL FOOTPRINT IN CHINA AS IT AIMS TO INCREASE ITS SALES LEAD OVER EUROPE\u2019S AIRBUS SE IN ASIA. ON THE OTHER HAND, EXECUTIVES HAVE TAKEN PAINS TO AVOID CLASHING WITH U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WHO HAS REPEATEDLY SAID THE UNITED STATES MUST TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT AMERICAN JOBS AND TECHNOLOGY.  ANALYSTS SAY CHINA HAS BEEN SLOW TO ORDER PLANES FROM BOTH BOEING AND EUROPE\u2019S AIRBUS SE AS ITS ECONOMY WAVERS AND IT HOLDS OFF MAJOR PROCUREMENT DECISIONS PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE DISPUTE WITH THE UNITED STATES.  \u201cIT\u2019S HARD TO PREDICT WHETHER OR NOT A SUCCESSFUL DEAL WILL BE ACHIEVED,\u201d MUILENBURG SAID. \u201cCHINA\u2019S BEEN NOT ORDERING AIRPLANES OVER THE LAST YEAR, YEAR AND A HALF. THAT PENT-UP DEMAND SIGNAL IS STILL THERE. THE AIRPLANE NEED IS REAL.\u201d  REUTERS REPORTED IN MARCH THAT THE PROSPECT OF A MAJOR POTENTIAL ORDER FOR MORE THAN 100 JETS, WORTH WELL OVER $10 BILLION AT LIST PRICES, HAD INCREASED AS WASHINGTON AND BEIJING CITED SOME PROGRESS IN TALKS TO RESOLVE THEIR MONTHS-LONG TRADE WAR.  BOEING\u2019S PLANE ORDERS HAVE ALSO BEEN CLOUDED BY THE GROUNDING OF THE PLANEMAKER\u2019S FAST-SELLING 737 MAX JETLINER IN THE WAKE OF TWO CRASHES THAT KILLED 346 PEOPLE.  \u2018BALANCED SOLUTION\u2019  MUILENBURG\u2019S COMMENTS COME AFTER CHINA\u2019S FOREIGN MINISTRY SAID ON TUESDAY IT HOPES WASHINGTON CAN CREATE CONDITIONS FOR TALKS, BUT THAT IT HAD NOT HEARD OF ANY RECENT TELEPHONE CALL BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA ON TRADE.

RAMP-UP AHEAD  BOEING HAS HAD TO DIVERT RESOURCES TO THE 737 MAX FROM ACROSS THE COMPANY AS IT WORKS TO WIN APPROVAL FROM AVIATION REGULATORS FOR ITS SOFTWARE UPGRADE.  IN APRIL, BOEING DROPPED PRODUCTION TO THE CURRENT RATE OF 42 AIRCRAFT PER MONTH AFTER HALTING DELIVERIES OF THE MAX TO AIRLINES, CUTTING OFF A KEY SOURCE OF CASH AND HITTING MARGINS. THE TOTAL COST OF THE 737 MAX CRISIS HAS GROWN TO MORE THAN $8 BILLION AND COUNTING.  REUTERS REPORTED LAST WEEK THAT BOEING TOLD SUPPLIERS IT WILL RAMP BACK UP TO PRE-CRASH PRODUCTION RATES OF 52 AIRCRAFT PER MONTH IN FEBRUARY AND REACH A RECORD 57 AIRCRAFT PER MONTH IN JUNE.

THE FEUD SAW BOTH PLANEMAKERS USE THE TRANSITION TO A NEW GENERATION OF JETS TO TRY TO POACH EACH OTHER\u2019S CUSTOMERS, AND TRADERS SAID AIR CANADA\u2019S 2013 DECISION TO SWITCH FROM AIRBUS\u2019S A320 FAMILY TO BOEING\u2019S 737 MAX STOOD OUT AS A MAJOR DEFECTION.  NOW, THE DECISION TO SWITCH SUPPLIERS POTENTIALLY WEIGHS ON SOME OF THOSE SAME AIRLINES AS THEY COPE WITHOUT A 737 FLEET.

THE CLOSED-DOOR BRIEFING, ON THE EVE OF A UNITED NATIONS AVIATION ASSEMBLY IN MONTREAL, WILL PUT REPRESENTATIVES FROM ABOUT 50 NATIONS IN THE SAME ROOM, TO SWAP CONCERNS ABOUT BOEING CO\u2019S PROPOSED SOFTWARE FIXES AND NEW PILOT TRAINING.  NEW FAA ADMINISTRATOR STEVE DICKSON DOWNPLAYED THE CHANCES OF A CONSENSUS BREAKTHROUGH, TELLING REUTERS LAST WEEK THAT THE MEETING WAS MORE \u201cTO PROVIDE REGULATORS WITH THE LATEST INFORMATION.\u201d  THE REPRESENTATIVES ARE DRAWN FROM COUNTRIES WITH AIRLINES THAT FLY THAT MAX AND THOSE THAT WILL HAVE FLIGHTS OF THE AIRCRAFT LANDING, HE SAID.  BOEING\u2019S BEST-SELLING JET WAS GROUNDED GLOBALLY IN MARCH, DAYS AFTER THE CRASH OF AN ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT THAT FOLLOWED A SIMILAR LION AIR DISASTER IN INDONESIA IN OCTOBER. A TOTAL OF 346 PEOPLE DIED IN THE TWO CRASHES.  THE U.S. MANUFACTURER HAS SPENT MONTHS WORKING TO UPDATE CRITICAL FLIGHT CONTROL SOFTWARE AT THE CENTER OF BOTH CRASHES, IN HOPES OF WINNING FAA APPROVAL FOR THE PLANES TO FLY AGAIN IN THE UNITED STATES BETWEEN OCTOBER AND DECEMBER.  AIRLINES HAVE URGED REGULATORS TO COORDINATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGES IN A BID TO AVOID DAMAGING SPLITS OVER SAFETY, BUT SOME COUNTRIES HAVE ALREADY VOWED TO RUN THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT VALIDATION STUDIES BEFORE RESTORING FLIGHTS.  THE EUROPEAN UNION AVIATION SAFETY AGENCY (EASA), WHICH IS DOING ITS OWN EXAMINATION OF THE 737 MAX DESIGN, SAID RECENTLY THERE WAS STILL NO APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO ISSUES WITH THE INTEGRITY OF THE AIRCRAFT\u2019S ANGLE OF ATTACK SYSTEM.  IN BOTH CRASHES, ERRONEOUS DATA TO ONE OF THE ANGLE OF ATTACK SENSORS LED TO THE ACTIVATION OF AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM THAT REPEATEDLY PUSHED DOWN THE PLANE\u2019S NOSE.  PAUL NJOROGE, WHO LOST HIS WIFE, THREE CHILDREN AND MOTHER-IN-LAW IN THE ETHIOPIAN CRASH, AND CHRIS MOORE, WHO LOST HIS DAUGHTER, PLAN TO HOLD PICTURES OF VICTIMS OUTSIDE THE MEETING.  THE FAA TURNED DOWN THEIR REQUEST TO ATTEND THE BRIEFING BUT DICKSON AGREED TO MEET THE TWO MEN BEFOREHAND, SAID NADIA MILLERON, WHOSE DAUGHTER, SAMYA STUMO, ALSO DIED IN THE ETHIOPIAN CRASH.  THE FAA IS STILL REVIEWING THE SOFTWARE UPDATE AND AWAITING A DOCUMENT LONGER THAN 500 PAGES FROM BOEING DETAILING THE FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM\u2019S ARCHITECTURE AND CHANGES, DICKSON SAID LAST WEEK.

REUTERS/LINDSEY WASSON/FILE PHOTO  THE U.S. AIR ACCIDENT INVESTIGATOR UNVEILED ON THURSDAY SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) FOLLOWING THE FATAL CRASHES OF A LION AIR 737 MAX IN INDONESIA AND AN ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES 737 MAX FIVE MONTHS APART THAT KILLED A TOTAL OF 346 PEOPLE. THE CRASHES LED TO THE PLANE\u2019S GROUNDING AND RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FAA\u2019S CERTIFICATION OF THE NEW AIRCRAFT.

THE SAFETY BOARD ALSO SAID THE FAA SHOULD DEVELOP \u201cROBUST TOOLS AND METHODS\u201d TO VALIDATE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PILOT RESPONSE.  BOEING IS REVISING THE 737 MAX SOFTWARE TO REQUIRE THE MCAS SYSTEM TO RECEIVE INPUT FROM BOTH AOA SENSORS, AND HAS ADDED ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS.  THE REPORT CAME A DAY AFTER BOEING\u2019S BOARD SAID IT HAD CREATED A NEW PERMANENT SAFETY COMMITTEE TO OVERSEE DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND OPERATION OF ITS AIRCRAFT AND SERVICES.  THE NTSB SAID IT WAS NOT ANALYZING PILOT ACTIONS IN THE TWO FATAL CRASHES AND THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE NOT A REFLECTION ON THE PILOTS IN THOSE CRASHES.  BOEING\u2019S 737 MAX SAFETY SYSTEM ASSESSMENTS ASSUMED \u201cIMMEDIATE AND APPROPRIATE PILOT CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO UNCOMMANDED FLIGHT CONTROL INPUTS, FROM SYSTEMS SUCH AS MCAS,\u201d THE NTSB SAID. IT SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HOW OTHER POSSIBLE FLIGHT DECK ALERTS AND OTHER FACTORS COULD IMPACT PILOTS\u2019 DECISION MAKING AND MAKES CHANGES AS WARRANTED, THE AGENCY ADDED.  THE NTSB SAID IT WANTS THE FAA TO REQUIRE THE SAME ASSESSMENT FOR ALL OTHER AIRPLANE MANUFACTURERS AND BELIEVES OTHER INTERNATIONAL REGULATORS THAT CERTIFY AIRPLANES SHOULD CONSIDER MAKING THE SAME CHANGES.

FILE PHOTO: A WORKER WALKS PAST UNPAINTED BOEING 737 MAX AIRCRAFT SEEN PARKED IN AN AERIAL PHOTO AT RENTON MUNICIPAL AIRPORT NEAR THE BOEING RENTON FACILITY IN RENTON, WASHINGTON, U.S. JULY 1, 2019. REUTERS/LINDSEY WASSON/FILE PHOTO  BOEING CO\u2019S FASTEST-SELLING JETLINER, THE 737 MAX, WAS GROUNDED WORLDWIDE IN MARCH AFTER TWO FATAL CRASHES THAT KILLED A TOTAL OF 346 PEOPLE WITHIN FIVE MONTHS.  PILOT OVERLOAD APPEARS TO HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN BOTH CRASHES, IN WHICH CREWS STRUGGLED TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE WHILE A NEW FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM REPEATEDLY PUSHED THE NOSE DOWN AMID A SERIES OF OTHER AUDIO AND SENSORY ALARMS AND ALERTS.  \u201cWHAT WE NEED TO DO IS ENSURE THAT THE AIRCREW IN THE MAX ARE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT ENVIRONMENT,\u201d ROBINSON SAID IN AN INTERVIEW WITH REUTERS.  TRANSPORT CANADA IS AMONG A CORE GROUP OF REGULATORS THAT IS EVALUATING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE 737 MAX TO FLY AGAIN AFTER A SEVEN-MONTH GROUNDING.  IT HAS BEEN CONVENING WEEKLY BY PHONE, VIDEO CONFERENCES OR FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION AND ITS COUNTERPARTS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND BRAZIL, ROBINSON SAID.  THEIR DECISIONS COULD LEAD TO SWEEPING CHANGES TO PILOT FLIGHT OPERATING MANUALS AND CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION AND EVEN MANDATES FOR COSTLY SIMULATOR TRAINING, INDUSTRY SOURCES HAVE SAID.  HOWEVER, NO TRAINING DECISIONS CAN BE MADE UNTIL BOEING SUBMITS SOFTWARE UPDATES TO THE FAA FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL, ROBINSON SAID.  TRANSPORT CANADA IS CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AVIATION SAFETY AGENCY ON RETURN TO SERVICE DEMANDS AND HAS ALSO RAISED QUESTIONS OVER THE ARCHITECTURE BEHIND THE 737 MAX\u2019S ANGLE OF ATTACK SYSTEM.  \u201cWE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR A SOLUTION PROPOSED BY THE MANUFACTURER AND THE FAA ON THAT AREA,\u201d HE SAID.  STILL, CANADA\u2019S GOAL IS FOR THE MAX TO RETURN IN COUNTRIES ACROSS THE GLOBE SIMULTANEOUSLY, OR AT LEAST IN CLOSE SUCCESSION.  \u201cIT\u2019S NOT A NECESSITY, BUT IT\u2019S A GOAL,\u201d ROBINSON SAID.  PILOT WORKLOAD  A STARTLE OR SURPRISE IN THE COCKPIT CAN ENDANGER A PILOT\u2019S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT AND WAS SAID TO PLAY A ROLE IN EARLIER AIR CRASHES LIKE AIR FRANCE FLIGHT 447 IN 2009.  THE SAME YEAR, CHESLEY \u201cSULLY\u201d SULLENBERGER SAFELY LANDED A US AIRWAYS FLIGHT ON THE HUDSON RIVER IN NEW YORK AFTER A BIRD STRIKE DISABLED THE ENGINES. HE TOLD LAWMAKERS IN JUNE THAT THE 737 MAX CREW COULD HAVE BEEN CONFUSED AS THEY STRUGGLED TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT.  \u201cI CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND THAT THE STARTLE FACTOR IS REAL AND IT\u2019S HUGE. IT ABSOLUTELY INTERFERES WITH ONE\u2019S ABILITY TO QUICKLY ANALYZE THE CRISIS AND TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION,\u201d SULLENBERGER SAID.  UNDER NEW SIMULATOR SCENARIOS, 737 MAX PILOTS WORLDWIDE MAY BE TRAINED ON RUNAWAY STABILIZER, A LOSS OF CONTROL THAT WAS TRIGGERED IN BOTH 737 MAX CRASHES, COUPLED WITH SOME KIND OF UNEXPECTED MALFUNCTION.  \u201cTHE ONLY WAY TO EFFECTIVELY DEAL WITH THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL REACTIONS OF \u2018STARTLE EFFECT\u2019 IS TO HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN EXPOSED TO IT,\u201d SAID CAPTAIN LARRY ROONEY, PRESIDENT OF THE COALITION OF AIRLINE PILOTS ASSOCIATIONS.  THE GOAL OF INTRODUCING STARTLES IS TO TEACH PILOTS HOW TO RESPOND TO \u201cFIGHT, FLIGHT OR FREEZE\u201d INSTINCTS IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE EFFECTS ARE NOT LIFE THREATENING, SAID ROONEY.

BOEING\u2019S SALES NUMBERS ON TUESDAY ALSO SHOWED THAT BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER IT HAD DELIVERED ONLY HALF THE NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT IT DID IN THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018.  REGULATORS ARE STILL REVIEWING PROPOSED SOFTWARE CHANGES TO THE GROUNDED PLANE WITH NO CERTAIN TIMETABLE FOR THE JET\u2019S RETURN.  AMERICAN, WHICH CANCELED 9,475 FLIGHTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER, SAID IT EXPECTS TO GRADUALLY RESUME MAX FLIGHTS STARTING JAN. 16, ADDING THAT SOFTWARE UPDATES COULD LEAD TO THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION\u2019S (FAA) \u201cRECERTIFICATION OF THE AIRCRAFT LATER THIS YEAR AND RESUMPTION OF COMMERCIAL SERVICE IN JANUARY 2020.\u201d  THE FAA SAID WEDNESDAY IT WAS \u201cFOLLOWING A THOROUGH PROCESS, NOT A PRESCRIBED TIMELINE, FOR RETURNING THE BOEING 737 MAX TO PASSENGER SERVICE. THE FAA WILL LIFT THE AIRCRAFT\u2019S PROHIBITION ORDER WHEN IT IS DEEMED SAFE TO DO SO.\u201d  REVIEW  THE FAST-SELLING 737 MAX HAS BEEN GROUNDED WORLDWIDE SINCE MID-MARCH WHILE BOEING UPDATES FLIGHT CONTROL SOFTWARE AT THE CENTER OF TWO CRASHES IN INDONESIA AND ETHIOPIA THAT TOGETHER KILLED 346 PEOPLE WITHIN A SPAN OF FIVE MONTHS.  AMONG OTHER U.S. AIRLINES THAT OPERATE THE MAX, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO HAS CANCELED FLIGHTS THROUGH JAN. 5 AND UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS INC UNTIL DEC. 19.  AN ONGOING REGULATORY SAFETY REVIEW MEANS A KEY 737 MAX CERTIFICATION TEST FLIGHT IS UNLIKELY BEFORE NOVEMBER, REUTERS REPORTED TUESDAY. BOEING HAS REPEATEDLY SAID IT HOPES TO RESUME FLIGHTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, WHICH BEGAN ON OCT. 1.  FAA ADMINISTRATOR STEVE DICKSON TOLD REUTERS IN SEPTEMBER THE AGENCY WOULD NEED ABOUT A MONTH FOLLOWING THE YET-TO-BE SCHEDULED CERTIFICATION TEST FLIGHT BEFORE THE PLANES COULD RETURN TO SERVICE.  BOEING PLANS TO REVISE THE 737 MAX SOFTWARE TO TAKE INPUT FROM BOTH OF ITS ANGLE-OF-ATTACK SENSORS IN THE ANTI-STALL SYSTEM LINKED TO THE TWO DEADLY CRASHES AND HAS ADDED ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS. BOEING IS ALSO ADDRESSING A FLAW DISCOVERED IN THE SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE OF THE 737 MAX FLIGHT-CONTROL SYSTEM THAT INVOLVES USING AND RECEIVING INPUT FROM THE PLANE\u2019S TWO FLIGHT CONTROL COMPUTERS RATHER THAN ONE.  MEANWHILE, AIRLINES THAT HAD PURCHASED THE FUEL-EFFICIENT MAX HAVE CANCELED THOUSANDS OF MONTHLY FLIGHTS AS THEY SCRAMBLE TO MEET DEMAND WITH SLIMMER FLEETS, EATING IN TO PROFIT AND HURTING SOME GROWTH PLANS.  ON MONDAY, THE SOUTHWEST AIRLINES PILOTS ASSOCIATION SUED BOEING ALLEGING THAT THE PLANEMAKER \u201cDELIBERATELY MISLED\u201d THE AIRLINE AND PILOTS ABOUT ITS 737 MAX AIRCRAFT. THE GROUNDING OF THE 737 MAX HAS WIPED OUT MORE THAN 30,000 SOUTHWEST AIRLINES FLIGHTS, CAUSING OVER $100 MILLION IN LOST WAGES FOR PILOTS, THE UNION SAID. BOEING SAID THE SUIT IS \u201cMERITLESS.\u201d  FORT WORTH, TEXAS-BASED AMERICAN, WITH 24 MAX JETS AT THE TIME OF THE GROUNDING AND DOZENS MORE ON ORDER, SAID IT EXPECTS TO RESUME ABOUT 20 MAX FLIGHTS A DAY IN MID-JANUARY AND PLANS TO SLOWLY RETURN THE MAX INTO COMMERCIAL SERVICE THROUGHOUT JANUARY AND INTO FEBRUARY.", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2019-10-10T00:00:00", "key": "20191010BA", "labelr0": -1.0561126520162096, "labelr1": 1.05660377358491, "labelr2": -0.4640990077883306, "labelr3": -0.5948871858084643, "labelr4": 0.3962691395298758, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.192, "compound": -0.2263, "0_day_return": -1.0561126520162056, "1_day_return": -1.0561126520162056, "2_day_return": 0.5876010781671326, "3_day_return": -0.0107816711590214, "4_day_return": 0.38544474393533706, "label": -1, "return": 0.010938977608159171, "excess_return": -1.0670516296243648, "count_of_word": 653, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.48550642, "prof1": 0.5144935, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4313709384350861, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5686290615649139, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.48550642, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.5144935, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.319912, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.680088, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.37313595, "tr_prof1": 0.6268640000000001, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.6246643, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.37533563, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.6994279999999999, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.300572, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.46202025, "headline_prof21": 0.5379798000000001, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.38640755, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.61359245, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.42787412, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.57212585, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.7463622, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.25363782, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -1.0561126520162056, "returnpredvader": 1.0561126520162056, "returnpredsgd": -1.0561126520162056, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0034739948926656, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9964268117782176, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9894355993333379, "cumreturn1b": 1.4679858715020124, "cumreturn1d": 0.8335775333467363, "cumreturn1e": 1.3631194035994967, "cumreturndow": 1.1731202513543353, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1443864022383559}, {"Unnamed: 0": 12871, "Unnamed: 0.1": 12871, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 12871, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 12871, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 12871, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 12871, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12871, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12871, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12871, "level_0": 12871, "index": 12871, "text": "OCT 11 (REUTERS) - BOEING CO SAID ON FRIDAY IT WAS SEPARATING THE ROLES OF CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO ALLOW CEO DENNIS MUILENBURG TO FOCUS FULL TIME ON RUNNING THE PLANEMAKER AS IT WORKS TO RETURN THE 737 MAX SAFELY TO SERVICE.

SOUTHWEST\u2019S NET INCOME ROSE TO $659 MILLION, OR $1.23 PER SHARE, IN THE THIRD QUARTER FROM $615 MILLION, OR $1.08 PER SHARE, A YEAR EARLIER ON A 1.1% RISE IN OPERATING REVENUE TO $5.64 BILLION.  NET INCOME AT AMERICAN ROSE TO $425 MILLION, OR 96 CENTS PER SHARE, FROM $372 MILLION, OR 81 CENTS PER SHARE, A YEAR EARLIER. TOTAL OPERATING REVENUE ROSE 3% TO $11.91 BILLION.  AMERICAN SHARES ROSE 3.8% TO $29.375 AND SOUTHWEST SHARES WERE UP 5.2% AT $56.02.  COST HIT  WITH 737 MAX JETS STILL PARKED PENDING BOEING\u2019S SOFTWARE UPDATES AND REGULATORY APPROVAL, AIRLINES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CONTINUALLY REVISE THEIR FLYING SCHEDULES AND GROWTH PLANS.

SOUTHWEST DID NOT PROVIDE A FULL-YEAR PROFIT FORECAST BUT SAID IT TOOK A $210 MILLION HIT TO OPERATING INCOME IN THE QUARTER FROM THE MAX SAFETY BAN, BRINGING THE NINE-MONTH TOTAL TO AN ESTIMATED $435 MILLION.

THE COMPANY INSISTED THE MISSING DISPLAY REPRESENTED NO SAFETY RISK.  MUILENBURG ACKNOWLEDGED THAT GETTING THE PLANE IN THE AIR \u201cHAS TAKEN LONGER THAN WE ORIGINALLY EXPECTED, BUT WE\u2019RE COMMITTED TO GETTING IT RIGHT, AND RETURN-TO-SERVICE TIMING IS COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON ANSWERING EACH AND EVERY QUESTION FROM THE FAA.\u201d  HE ADDED THAT \u201cREGULATORS SHOULD APPROVE THE RETURN OF THE MAX TO THE SKIES ONLY AFTER THEY HAVE APPLIED THE MOST RIGOROUS SCRUTINY, AND ARE COMPLETELY SATISFIED AS TO THE PLANE\u2019S SAFETY.

THE EMBATTLED PLANEMAKER IS TRYING TO REBUILD TRUST AND COOPERATION WITH AIRLINES, PASSENGERS AND REGULATORS AROUND THE WORLD AFTER THE 737 MAX WAS GROUNDED IN MARCH, FOLLOWING CRASHES IN WHICH A TOTAL OF 346 PEOPLE DIED.  DETAILS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S \u201cGLOBAL AVIATION SAFETY\u201d INITIATIVE REMAIN UNDER WRAPS DUE TO DELAYS IN RETURNING THE 737 MAX TO SERVICE, AS ATTENTION FOCUSES ON CHANGES TO COCKPIT SOFTWARE THAT INVESTIGATORS SAY PLAYED A MAJOR PART IN THE TWO CRASHES.  BOEING WILL LAUNCH THE PILOT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT AFTER REGULATORS APPROVE CHANGES TO 737 MAX SOFTWARE AND TRAINING AND THE PLANE RESUMES FLIGHTS, ONE OF THE PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER SAID. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS THAT TO HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES BY YEAR-END.  THE PLANE IS LIKELY TO RETURN TO SERVICE IN EUROPE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, THE HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AVIATION SAFETY AGENCY (EASA) SAID EARLIER THIS WEEK.  THE PILOT PROJECT SPENDING BUDGET, PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH IT SAID, WILL BE IN ADDITION TO THE MORE THAN $8 BILLION IN COSTS FROM COMPENSATION TO AIRLINES FOR DELAYED AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES AND LOWER PRODUCTION TIED TO THE 737 MAX GROUNDING.  THE TRAINING INITIATIVE IS STILL BEING DEVELOPED AND WILL BE ROLLED OUT OVER YEARS, ONE OF THE PEOPLE SAID. WHILE COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO RISE OVER TIME, THE EFFORT MAY OVERLAP WITH FUTURE AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS.  \u201cIT WILL INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT FUNDS TO RAISE STANDARDS AROUND THE WORLD AND REQUIRES BOEING PUTTING ITS OWN MONEY IN,\u201d SAID ANOTHER PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE PROJECT.  BOEING CHIEF EXECUTIVE DENNIS MUILENBURG WAS ACCUSED BY U.S. LAWMAKERS IN BACK-TO-BACK HEARINGS LAST WEEK OF PLACING PROFITS OVER THOSE SAFETY STANDARDS, A CHARGE BOEING DENIES.  MUILENBURG SAID BOEING WOULD HELP \u201cBUILD A TALENT PIPELINE\u201d OF PILOTS AND INVEST HEAVILY IN THE PILOT-MACHINE INTERFACE OR FIGHT DECK FOR THE NEXT GENERATION, BUT GAVE FEW DETAILS.  A BOEING SPOKESMAN DECLINED ADDITIONAL COMMENT.  PART OF BOEING\u2019S INVESTMENTS WILL INCLUDE IMPROVING AVIATION INFRASTRUCTURE, SUCH AS AIR TRAFFIC AND FLIGHT SIMULATION SYSTEMS, A THIRD PERSON WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANS SAID.  IT IS ALSO CONSIDERING WHETHER TO DEVELOP NEW TRAINING MATERIALS OR METHODS FOR VARIOUS CAREER STAGES, AND FUND TRAINING CENTERS OR RECRUITMENT EFFORTS, THE PEOPLE SAID.  BOEING COULD ALSO CREATE A DATA-SHARING NETWORK ON AIRCRAFT DESIGN WITH GLOBAL REGULATORS, ONE OF THE PEOPLE SAID, IN A BID TO IMPROVE OUTSIDE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS AIRCRAFT TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS.  THE HEAD OF THE EASA TOLD REUTERS IN A RECENT INTERVIEW THAT IT WOULD DEMAND MORE DATA WHEN DECIDING WHETHER TO CERTIFY FUTURE JETS.  PILOT SHORTFALL  OUTLINES OF THE NEW INVESTMENT WERE DRAWN UP IN THE WAKE OF THE CRASHES AS BOEING EXECUTIVES ACKNOWLEDGED THAT STALL-PREVENTION SOFTWARE KNOWN AS MCAS CONFUSED THE PILOTS DUE TO AN OVERWHELMING WORKLOAD, THE PEOPLE SAID.  INVESTIGATIONS HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS OVER WHETHER THAT WAS IN PART DUE TO FAULTY ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE HAZARDS INVOLVED, LEADING TO A DESIGN THAT PLACED UNREALISTIC DEMANDS ON PILOTS.  INVESTIGATORS AND GLOBAL REGULATORS HAVE ALSO PINPOINTED CONCERNS ABOUT CERTIFICATION AND TRAINING.  BOEING SAYS IT FOLLOWED INDUSTRY PRACTICE ON REACTION TIMES.  EXPERTS SAY THAT BOEING, AS THE LARGEST PLANEMAKER IN THE WORLD, AND ITS REGULATOR, U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, HAVE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN SHAPING GLOBAL STANDARDS AROUND AIRCRAFT DESIGN AND OPERATIONS.  EVEN BEFORE THE CRASHES, THE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY WAS BRACING FOR A STAFFING SHORTFALL OF 1.5 MILLION AIRCRAFT TECHNICIANS AND PILOTS OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS.  BOTH BOEING AND EUROPE\u2019S AIRBUS (AIR.PA) HAVE ALREADY LAUNCHED BEGINNER TRAINING PROGRAMS TO HELP EASE THE SHORTAGES.

REUTERS/BRENDAN MCDERMID  THE CRASHES HAVE ALSO SPED UP A RETHINK OF SAFETY NEEDS IN EMERGING MARKETS, WHERE DEMAND FOR NEW JETS IS DRIVING A HUGE SHARE OF BOEING\u2019S BUSINESS. BUT AIRLINES FACE GAPS IN REGULATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE.  SAFETY EXPERTS HAVE VOICED CONCERNS THAT THE SHEER GROWTH OF AVIATION HAS LOWERED THE BAR FOR THE SKILLS REQUIRED TO ENTER TRAINING, ADDING PRESSURE FOR COCKPIT AND TRAINING IMPROVEMENTS.  \u201cTHERE IS A LARGE GENERATION OF PILOTS THAT WILL BE NEEDED OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS AND WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT DESIGNING OUR AIRPLANES FOR THAT NEXT GENERATION,\u201d MUILENBURG SAID AT THE HEARING LAST WEEK.", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2019-11-06T00:00:00", "key": "20191106BA", "labelr0": -1.1443244299310678, "labelr1": 0.8808831418165405, "labelr2": -1.7659735243905856, "labelr3": 4.5470085470085415, "labelr4": -1.1118378024852802, "pos": 0.237, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.4215, "0_day_return": -1.144324429931065, "1_day_return": 0.8808831418165353, "2_day_return": -0.9006465456393498, "3_day_return": 3.605409525960624, "4_day_return": 2.4534854174313114, "label": 1, "return": 0.002730095398704889, "excess_return": 0.8781530464178304, "count_of_word": 756, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.58818024, "prof1": 0.41181976, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4959545113627368, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5040454886372632, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.58818024, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.41181976, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.4837569000000001, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.51624304, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5067242000000001, "tr_prof1": 0.49327582, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.51969284, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.48030722, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5209014, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.47909865, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.4843734000000001, "headline_prof21": 0.5156265999999999, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.47393784, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5260621999999999, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.5409795000000001, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.45902047, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.734313, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.26568708, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": -0.8808831418165353, "returnpredvader": 0.8808831418165353, "returnpredsgd": 0.8808831418165353, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9981903566890193, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0063096611188536, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0006586840289635, "cumreturn1b": 1.4201452581761813, "cumreturn1d": 0.8307028572248034, "cumreturn1e": 1.404699218197401, "cumreturndow": 1.218504389476749, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1810101837209517}, {"Unnamed: 0": 14566, "Unnamed: 0.1": 14566, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 14566, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 14566, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 14566, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 14566, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 14566, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 14566, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 14566, "level_0": 14566, "index": 14566, "text": "WASHINGTON/PARIS (REUTERS) - U.S. AND EUROPEAN REGULATORS HAVE ASKED BOEING CO (BA.N) TO REVISE DOCUMENTATION ON ITS PROPOSED 737 MAX SOFTWARE FIX, THE PLANEMAKER CONFIRMED WEDNESDAY, FURTHER COMPLICATING ITS EFFORTS TO RETURN THE JET TO SERVICE BY YEAR-END.

THE OTHER ISSUE INVOLVES THE ADEQUACY OF RUDDER CABLE PROTECTION ON THE BOEING 737 MAX \u201cFROM AN UNCONTAINED ENGINE FAILURE AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SEVERANCE OF THE CABLE AND A POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC LOSS OF CONTROL,\u201d THE LETTER SAID, CITING A 2014 MEMO FROM AN FAA MANAGER THAT SUGGESTED BOEING HAD NOT INCORPORATED ADEQUATE PROTECTION FOLLOWING A DEADLY 1989 UNITED AIRLINES ENGINE FAILURE ACCIDENT IN IOWA.

THE MCAS SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO COUNTERACT THE EFFECT ON HANDLING OF THE NEW, LARGER ENGINES ON THE 737 MAX, WHICH HAD TO BE PLACED FARTHER FORWARD AND HIGHER ON THE WINGS BECAUSE THE 50-YEAR-OLD 737 DESIGN SITS RELATIVELY LOW TO THE GROUND.

FILE PHOTO: THE SAFRAN COMPANY LOGO IS PICTURED AT THE COMPANY'S LOGISTIC AREA IN COLOMIERS NEAR TOULOUSE, FRANCE, MARCH 20, 2019. REUTERS/REGIS DUVIGNAU/FILE PHOTO  SAFRAN CO-PRODUCES THE LEAP ENGINE FOR THE MAX THROUGH ITS CFM INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURE WITH GENERAL ELECTRIC (GE.N).  ONCE THE JET RETURNS TO SERVICE - THE TIMING OF WHICH IS IN THE HANDS OF REGULATORS - BOEING PLANS TO REACH A PREVIOUSLY TARGETED PRODUCTION LEVEL OF 57 AIRCRAFT A MONTH BY END-2020 FROM ITS CURRENT RATE OF 42, DOWN FROM 52 BEFORE THE GROUNDING.  IT HAS NOT OFFERED FURTHER DETAILS ON HOW FAST OUTPUT WOULD RISE.  SPEAKING TO A GROUP OF REPORTERS, SAFRAN CEO PHILIPPE PETITCOLIN NOTED PLANEMAKERS LIKE BOEING TYPICALLY ALTER PRODUCTION IN INCREMENTAL STEPS OF 5 AIRCRAFT A MONTH.  \u201cIT IS USUALLY RECOMMENDED TO GO UP BY 5 A MONTH EVERY 6 MONTHS, OTHERWISE YOU CAN LOSE EVERYONE (SUPPLIERS),\u201d HE SAID.  HE DECLINED TO COMMENT DIRECTLY ON BOEING PRODUCTION PLANS, BUT HIS COMMENTS SUGGEST THE PLANEMAKER MAY NOT FIND IT EASY TO REACH 57 A MONTH UNTIL 2021, EVEN IF THE MAX IS UNGROUNDED THIS YEAR.  BOEING\u2019S CURRENT PLAN IMPLIES OUTPUT INCREASES EVERY FOUR MONTHS INSTEAD OF EVERY SIX, A RATE OF CHANGE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN THAT PETITCOLIN DESCRIBED AS AMBITIOUS.  BOEING SAID ANY PRODUCTION INCREASES WOULD OCCUR GRADUALLY ONCE DELIVERIES RESUMED, ENSURING THE HEALTH OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND KEEPING PRODUCTION SYSTEMS STABLE.  \u201cWE CONTINUE TO ASSESS PRODUCTION DECISIONS AND ALWAYS WORK ON PLANS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS,\u201d A SPOKESMAN SAID.  NOT ALL SUPPLIERS ARE EXPOSED TO THE SAME PRESSURE. SOME HAVE CONTINUED TO PRODUCE AT 52 A MONTH DURING THE CRISIS IN ORDER TO AVOID KINKS IN PRODUCTION.  ONCE THE GROUNDING IS LIFTED, BOEING HAS SUGGESTED IT CAN DELIVER 70 MAX AIRCRAFT A MONTH, MATCHING THE MOST IT HAS DELIVERED IN ANY PREVIOUS MONTH.  THE ACTUAL PRODUCTION RATE IN ITS ASSEMBLY PLANT MAY DEPEND ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH BOEING DECIDES TO MEET THIS GOAL DIRECTLY FROM THE PRODUCTION LINE OR FROM THE HUNDREDS OF AIRCRAFT NOW IN STORAGE, WHICH HAVE BEEN BUILT DURING THE GROUNDING.  PETITCOLIN SAID CFM WOULD WORK HARD TO RESPOND TO WHATEVER PRODUCTION RATE BOEING DEEMED NECESSARY.  IT IS ALSO BRACING FOR INCREASED DEMAND FOR LEAP ENGINES FROM EUROPE\u2019S AIRBUS BECAUSE OF INCREASES IN CFM SALES AGAINST RIVAL PRATT & WHITNEY (UTX.N).

BOEING IS BUYING 80% OF EMBRAER\u2019S COMMERCIAL JETS DIVISION, ITS MOST PROFITABLE, TO COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH AIRBUS IN THE MARKET FOR PLANES WITH FEWER THAN 150 SEATS.  \u201cIT IS A KILLER ACQUISITION, NOT A JOINT VENTURE,\u201d VALPORTO SAID IN AN INTERVIEW LATE WEDNESDAY, REFERRING TO DEALS WHERE COMPANIES BUY SMALLER RIVALS TO SHUT THEM DOWN, AN ISSUE TROUBLING COMPETITION ENFORCERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC.  \u201cEMBRAER AIRPLANES ARE COMPETITORS OF BOEING AIRPLANES. WHAT WILL BE LEFT FROM EMBRAER WON\u2019T SURVIVE, AND EVEN IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SURVIVE, EMBRAER WOULDN\u2019T BE ABLE TO PRODUCE ANY AIRCRAFT WITH 50 PASSENGERS OR MORE,\u201d VALPORTO SAID.  THE DEAL HAS ALREADY BEEN APPROVED BY REGULATORS IN THE UNITED STATES, CHINA AND JAPAN.  THE COMMISSION, WHICH LAUNCHED A FULL-SCALE INVESTIGATION INTO THE DEAL IN OCTOBER, DECLINED TO COMMENT.  BOEING SAID IT AND EMBRAER HAD BEEN ENGAGED WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND OTHER GLOBAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES SINCE LATE LAST YEAR.  \u201cWE CONTINUE TO CO-OPERATE WITH THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND CADE AS THEY ASSESS OUR TRANSACTION AND LOOK FORWARD TO A POSITIVE RESOLUTION,\u201d A SPOKESMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID.  THE EU HAS VOICED CONCERNS THE DEAL WOULD REMOVE WORLD NO. 3 PLAYER EMBRAER FROM THE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY AND FROM THE OVERALL SINGLE AISLE PLANE MARKET, AN INDICATION THAT IT WILL DEMAND SIGNIFICANT CONCESSIONS FROM BOEING TO ALLEVIATE ITS WORRIES.  THE EU REGULATOR HALTED ITS INVESTIGATION LAST MONTH WHILE WAITING FOR BOEING TO SUBMIT DATA ON THE DEAL.  \u201cI THINK THIS DEAL SHOULDN\u2019T BE ACCEPTED BY THE EU. IF NOT BLOCKED, IT SHOULD DEMAND MAJOR CONCESSIONS FROM BOEING,\u201d VALPORTO SAID, ADDING THAT BOEING SHOULD BE FORCED TO SELL OFF ITS SINGLE AISLE COMMERCIAL PLANES.

THE 737 MAX HAS BEEN GROUNDED SINCE MARCH AFTER TWO CRASHES IN INDONESIA AND ETHIOPIA KILLED 346 PEOPLE WITHIN FIVE MONTHS, COSTING THE MANUFACTURER MORE THAN $9 BILLION SO FAR.  \u201cEACH SUPPLIER WILL LIKELY BE MISSING ABOUT 200 DELIVERIES VERSUS ORIGINAL PLANS, WITH ABOUT 80% OF THE SHORTFALL COMING IN 2020 AND THE REMAINDER IN 2021,\u201d MELIUS RESEARCH ANALYST CARTER COPELAND WROTE IN A NOTE.

THE FALLOUT EXTENDED TO CARRIERS, WITH SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO (LUV.N) EXTENDING CANCELLATIONS OF MAX FLIGHTS BY ANOTHER FIVE WEEKS THROUGH APRIL 13, DUE TO THE CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE TIMING OF THE AIRCRAFT\u2019S RETURN TO SERVICE.

THE U.S. SPACE AGENCY IS FORMING AN INVESTIGATIVE TEAM TO DETERMINE WHAT CAUSED THE TIMER GLITCH AND \u201cANY OTHER SOFTWARE ISSUES,\u201d NASA SAID.

NASA SAID IT WAS WEIGHING WHETHER TO MAKE BOEING REPEAT THE TEST, WHICH WOULD LIKELY COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND ADD FURTHER DELAY, TO SHOW IT CAN DOCK AT THE STATION SUCCESSFULLY. DOCKING WAS A KEY REQUIREMENT FOR THE TEST UNDER BOEING\u2019S CONTRACT.  \u201cALTHOUGH DATA FROM THE UNCREWED TEST IS IMPORTANT FOR CERTIFICATION, IT MAY NOT BE THE ONLY WAY THAT BOEING IS ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE ITS SYSTEM\u2019S FULL CAPABILITIES,\u201d THE AGENCY SAID.

THE UKRAINE INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES BOEING 737-800, EN ROUTE TO KIEV AND CARRYING MOSTLY IRANIANS AND IRANIAN-CANADIANS, CRASHED HOURS AFTER IRAN FIRED MISSILES AT BASES HOUSING U.S. FORCES IN IRAQ, LEADING SOME TO SPECULATE THAT THE PLANE MAY HAVE BEEN HIT.  BUT A CANADIAN SECURITY SOURCE, WHO ASKED NOT TO BE NAMED, TOLD REUTERS THAT THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF WESTERN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES WAS THAT THE PLANE HAD SUFFERED A TECHNICAL MALFUNCTION AND HAD NOT BEEN BROUGHT DOWN BY A MISSILE. THERE WAS EVIDENCE ONE OF THE JET\u2019S ENGINES HAD OVERHEATED, THE SOURCE SAID.  THE CRASH COMES AT A DIFFICULT TIME FOR PLANEMAKER BOEING CO , WHICH HAS GROUNDED ITS 737 MAX FLEET AFTER TWO CRASHES LAST YEAR. THE 737-800 IS ONE OF THE WORLD\u2019S MOST-FLOWN MODELS WITH A GOOD SAFETY RECORD AND DOES NOT HAVE THE SOFTWARE FEATURE IMPLICATED IN CRASHES OF THE 737 MAX.  \u201cWE ARE IN CONTACT WITH OUR AIRLINE CUSTOMERS AND STAND BY THEM IN THIS DIFFICULT TIME. WE ARE READY TO ASSIST IN ANY WAY NEEDED,\u201d THE MANUFACTURER SAID IN A STATEMENT EARLIER ON WEDNESDAY. IT DECLINED FURTHER COMMENT. BOEING SHARES FELL 1.3% ON WEDNESDAY.  IN PARIS ON WEDNESDAY MORNING, THE MAKER OF THE PLANE\u2019S ENGINES, FRENCH-U.S. FIRM CFM - CO-OWNED BY GENERAL ELECTRIC CO AND FRANCE\u2019S SAFRAN - SAID SPECULATION REGARDING THE CAUSE WAS PREMATURE.  SMOULDERING PARTS AND DEBRIS, INCLUDING SHOES AND CLOTHES, WERE STREWN ACROSS A FIELD SOUTHWEST OF THE IRANIAN CAPITAL, WHERE RESCUE WORKERS IN FACE MASKS LAID OUT SCORES OF BODY BAGS.  AMONG THE VICTIMS WERE 82 IRANIANS, 63 CANADIANS, AND 11 UKRAINIANS, UKRAINIAN AUTHORITIES SAID. THE TEHRAN-TORONTO VIA KIEV ROUTE WAS A POPULAR ONE FOR CANADIANS OF IRANIAN DESCENT VISITING IRAN, IN THE ABSENCE OF DIRECT FLIGHTS, AND CARRIED MANY STUDENTS AND ACADEMICS HEADING HOME FROM THE HOLIDAYS.  THE VICTIMS INCLUDED A NEWLYWED COUPLE THAT HAD GONE TO IRAN TO GET MARRIED. ARASH POURZARABI, 26, AND POUNEH GOURJI, 25, WERE GRADUATE STUDENTS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA. FOUR MEMBERS OF THEIR WEDDING PARTY WERE ALSO ON BOARD.  AT KIEV\u2019S MAIN AIRPORT, CANDLES AND FLOWERS WERE LAID NEXT TO PICTURES OF THE DECEASED UKRAINIAN CREW MEMBERS. KATERYNA GAPONENKO, WHO WAS MARRIED TO PILOT VOLODYMYR GAPONENKO, TOLD LOCAL CHANNEL 1+1 THAT SHE HAD PLEADED WITH HER HUSBAND BEFORE THE FLIGHT NOT TO FLY TO TEHRAN.  IT WAS KIEV-BASED UKRAINE INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES\u2019 FIRST FATAL CRASH, AND THE CARRIER SAID IT WAS DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH THE CAUSE.  UKRAINE SAID IT WAS SENDING A TEAM OF EXPERTS TO IRAN TO INVESTIGATE. PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKIY SAID HE HAD INSTRUCTED UKRAINE\u2019S PROSECUTOR GENERAL TO OPEN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS, WITHOUT SPECIFYING WHO THEY WOULD INVOLVE.  CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU SAID CANADA WOULD \u201cCONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH ITS INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THIS CRASH IS THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED\u201d AND U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO SAID THE UNITED STATES WAS CALLING FOR COMPLETE COOPERATION WITH ANY INVESTIGATION INTO CAUSE OF THE CRASH.  UNDER INTERNATIONAL RULES, RESPONSIBILITY FOR INVESTIGATING THE CRASH LIES WITH IRAN. IRANIAN STATE TELEVISION SAID BOTH OF THE PLANE\u2019S BLACK BOX VOICE AND DATA RECORDERS HAD BEEN FOUND.  THE SEMI-OFFICIAL MEHR NEWS AGENCY QUOTED THE HEAD OF IRAN\u2019S CIVIL AVIATION ORGANISATION AS SAYING IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHICH COUNTRY IRAN WOULD SEND THE BLACK BOXES TO FOR ANALYSIS OF THE DATA, BUT IT WOULD NOT GIVE THEM TO BOEING.  AMATEUR VIDEO  THE PLANE THAT CRASHED WAS A THREE-YEAR-OLD BOEING 737-800NG. ITS LAST SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE WAS ON JAN. 6, UKRAINE INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES SAID.  AN AMATEUR VIDEO, RUN BY IRANIAN NEWS AGENCIES AND PURPORTEDLY OF THE CRASHING PLANE, SHOWED A DESCENDING FLASH IN A DARK SKY. IT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY COMMENTS THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS \u201cON FIRE\u201d AND THEN A BRIGHTER FLASH AS IT APPEARS TO HIT THE GROUND. REUTERS COULD NOT AUTHENTICATE THE FOOTAGE.  EARLY ON WEDNESDAY, IRAN HAD FIRED MORE THAN A DOZEN BALLISTIC MISSILES AT BASES HOUSING U.S. FORCES IN IRAQ IN RETALIATION FOR A U.S. DRONE STRIKE LAST WEEK THAT KILLED AN IRANIAN MILITARY COMMANDER.  SOME AIRLINES CANCELLED IRAN AND IRAQ FLIGHTS AND RE-ROUTED OTHERS AWAY FROM BOTH COUNTRIES\u2019 AIRSPACE FOLLOWING THE MISSILE STRIKES. THE EUROPEAN AVIATION SAFETY AGENCY RECOMMENDED THAT COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS AVOID IRAQI AIRSPACE.  IRANIAN TV PUT THE CRASH DOWN TO UNSPECIFIED TECHNICAL PROBLEMS, AND IRANIAN MEDIA QUOTED A LOCAL AVIATION OFFICIAL AS SAYING THE PILOT DID NOT DECLARE AN EMERGENCY.  SAFETY EXPERTS SAY AIRLINER ACCIDENTS RARELY HAVE A SINGLE CAUSE AND THAT IT TYPICALLY TAKES MONTHS OF INVESTIGATION TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE FACTORS BEHIND THEM.  MODERN AIRCRAFT ARE DESIGNED AND CERTIFIED TO COPE WITH AN ENGINE FAILURE SHORTLY AFTER TAKE-OFF AND TO FLY FOR EXTENDED PERIODS ON ONE ENGINE. BUT AN UNCONTAINED ENGINE FAILURE RELEASING SHRAPNEL CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO OTHER AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS.", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2020-01-08T00:00:00", "key": "20200108BA", "labelr0": -1.7522533206831028, "labelr1": 1.4998340223918791, "labelr2": -1.9087827793304275, "labelr3": 0.090931134820566, "labelr4": 0.6450245291018094, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.489, "compound": -0.8225, "0_day_return": -1.752253320683106, "1_day_return": 1.4998340223918882, "2_day_return": -0.4375773304765018, "3_day_return": -0.3470440896882532, "4_day_return": 0.2957419199082656, "label": 1, "return": 0.006655262499467345, "excess_return": 1.4931787598924209, "count_of_word": 851, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.40849543, "prof1": 0.5915045, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4785581664467398, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5214418335532602, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.40849543, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.5915045, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.38038197, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.619618, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.54388297, "tr_prof1": 0.45611709999999994, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5484869000000001, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.4515131, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.54047376, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.4595262, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.46369356, "headline_prof21": 0.53630644, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.36758536, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.63241464, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.37825173, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.62174827, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.7175309, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.28246906, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -1.4998340223918882, "returnpredvader": -1.4998340223918882, "returnpredsgd": 1.4998340223918882, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0086664864148371, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0086664864148371, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0073939180565115, "cumreturn1b": 1.3960990002068974, "cumreturn1d": 0.8507039604186146, "cumreturn1e": 1.384627639168966, "cumreturndow": 1.2933560934729922, "cumreturnsp500": 1.2357232314475395}, {"Unnamed: 0": 16825, "Unnamed: 0.1": 16825, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 16825, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 16825, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 16825, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 16825, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16825, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16825, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16825, "level_0": 16825, "index": 16825, "text": "FILE PHOTO: BOEING 787 DREAMLINERS ARE SHOWN IN FINAL PRODUCTION AT WIDEBODY FACTORY IN NORTH CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA, U.S., JANUARY 17, 2019.

BOEING\u2019S SHARES FELL AS MUCH AS 11% TO $205.56 ON NEWS OF THE LOAN DRAWDOWN, INITIALLY REPORTED BY BLOOMBERG NEWS, BROADLY IN LINE WITH A COLLAPSE IN AIRLINE AND OTHER AEROSPACE SHARES ACROSS THE BOARD.  THE PLANEMAKER MAY DRAW DOWN THE MONEY AS EARLY AS FRIDAY, THE SOURCE SAID.  BOEING HAD NO IMMEDIATE COMMENT.  U.S. COMPANIES HAVE BEEN RUSHING TO BORROW MORE MONEY AND BOOST THEIR CASH COFFERS THIS WEEK, AS MARKET TURMOIL FUELED BY A PLUNGE IN OIL PRICES AND THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK RAISED THE PROSPECT OF AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.  AIRLINES HAVE BEEN AMONG THE WORST HIT, AS A COLLAPSE IN BOOKINGS AND BUSINESS TRAVEL FORCED RADICAL CUTS IN FLIGHT SCHEDULES, CAPACITY AND ANNUAL RESULTS FORECASTS.  BOEING\u2019S TOTAL DEBT NEARLY DOUBLED TO $27.3 BILLION IN 2019, AS IT COMPENSATED AIRLINES AND GRAPPLED WITH ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION COSTS FOR THE 737 MAX EVEN AS THE GROUNDING PREVENTED IT FROM DELIVERING THE AIRCRAFT TO BUYERS.  MEDIA REPORTED LAST MONTH THAT THE PLANEMAKER HAD RAISED A TOTAL OF $13.825 BILLION IN A FUND RAISING ROUND FROM LENDERS INCLUDING BANK OF CHINA AND PNC. ANALYSTS ESTIMATED LAST YEAR THAT THE COMPANY WAS LEAKING AROUND $1 BILLION MONTHLY AS A RESULT OF THE MAX GROUNDING.

JOHNSON  PARIS/SAO PAULO/SEATTLE, MARCH 19 (REUTERS) - BRAZIL HAS UPHELD PROPOSALS BY BOEING CO TO BUY THE JETMAKING ARM OF EMBRAER, BUT PLUNGING MARKETS HAVE RAISED URGENT QUESTIONS OVER THE FATE OF THE $4.2 BILLION DEAL AS AVIATION REELS FROM THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS.  BRAZIL\u2019S ANTI-TRUST WATCHDOG DISMISSED PROSECUTORS\u2019 OBJECTIONS TO THE POLITICALLY SENSITIVE DEAL ON WEDNESDAY.  A SLUMP IN EMBRAER SHARES AND CASH CONCERNS AT BOEING DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS ON AIR TRAVEL DEALT A BLOW TO THE DEAL\u2019S FRAGILE ECONOMICS, HOWEVER, COMPOUNDING UNCERTAINTY CAUSED BY DELAYS IN WINNING EUROPEAN UNION REGULATORY APPROVAL.  SHARES IN THE WORLD\u2019S THIRD-LARGEST PLANEMAKER FELL 14% ON WEDNESDAY, GIVING IT A MARKET VALUE OF ABOUT $1.3 BILLION AFTER FALLING BY TWO THIRDS SINCE THE DEAL WAS FIRST AIRED IN 2018, ACCORDING TO REFINITIV EIKON DATA.  AT SUCH PRICES, BOEING WOULD GAIN CONTROL OF THE COMMERCIAL UNIT OF EMBRAER BUT ONLY AFTER PAYING THREE TIMES THE VALUE OF THE WHOLE COMPANY, WHICH ALSO MAKES MILITARY AND BUSINESS JETS.  BOEING HAS OFFERED TO PAY $4.2 BILLION IN CASH FOR 80% OF EMBRAER\u2019S COMMERCIAL UNIT, WHICH BUILDS JETLINERS IN THE 70- TO 150-SEAT SEGMENT AND COMPETES WITH THE CANADIAN-DESIGNED A220 PROGRAMME RECENTLY ACQUIRED BY EUROPE\u2019S AIRBUS.  RECENT TRENDS \u201cHAVE INCREASED THE CHANCES THAT THIS DEAL DOES NOT GET DONE,\u201d CANACCORD GENUITY ANALYST KEN HERBERT SAID.  AT STAKE IS A KEY PLANK OF BOEING\u2019S STRATEGY FOR EXPANDING ITS ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL BASE JUST AS IT FACES TALKS OVER $60 BILLION OF U.S. SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. AEROSPACE INDUSTRY.  WHILE BOEING COULD, ANALYSTS NOTE, SEEK A LOWER PRICE, PLEDGES BAKED INTO THE DEAL DURING MONTHS OF SENSITIVE NEGOTIATIONS LEAVE EMBRAER\u2019S SHAREHOLDERS LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE BARRING A SHARP REBOUND.  EMBRAER PLANS TO PAY A $1.6 BILLION SPECIAL DIVIDEND TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS OUT OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE TRANSACTION.  AFTER ALLOWING FOR TAXES, THE PLAN WOULD PLACE EMBRAER\u2019S COMMERCIAL ARM LED BY JOHN SLATTERY IN A NEW BOEING-LED VENTURE COMPETING WITH AIRBUS\u2019S A220 AND KEEP ASIDE SOME $1 BILLION OF NET CASH FOR EMBRAER\u2019S REMAINING DEFENCE AND PRIVATE-JET UNITS.  EMBRAER\u2019S BATTERED MARKET VALUE THREATENS TO UPEND THOSE CALCULATIONS, BARRING AN UNLIKELY DECISION TO FOREGO THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND OR SADDLE THE OLD EMBRAER WITH DEBT, ANALYSTS SAID.  SUPPORT PLAN  BOEING\u2019S NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE, DAVE CALHOUN, SAID IN JANUARY HE WAS COMMITTED TO THE DEAL. HE MUST NOW CONVINCE BOEING\u2019S BOARD TO PURSUE IT WHILE ALSO FACING CRITICS IN CONGRESS WHO ARE QUESTIONING HOW POTENTIAL U.S. TAXPAYER FUNDS WOULD BE DEPLOYED.  \u201cTHEY ARE GOING TO WASHINGTON WITH THEIR HANDS OUT FOR A BAILOUT AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND LOOKING AT SPENDING $4.2 BILLION TO COMPLETE THE DEAL,\u201d HERBERT SAID.  CALHOUN\u2019S $7 MILLION PERFORMANCE BONUS, PART OF A THREE-YEAR PACKAGE TETHERED TO BOEING\u2019S SHARE PRICE, HANGS IN PART ON HIS ABILITY TO CLOSE THE EMBRAER DEAL, ASSUMING REGULATORY APPROVAL.  \u201cWE DON\u2019T COMMENT PUBLICLY ON DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES OR MARKET SPECULATION. WE ARE ADDRESSING THE REGULATORY APPROVALS PROCESS AND OUTSTANDING CLOSING CONDITIONS,\u201d A BOEING SPOKESWOMAN SAID.  EMBRAER DECLINED TO COMMENT.  EMBRAER\u2019S OPTIONS SHOULD THE DEAL FAIL HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED AND POTENTIAL ALLIANCE PARTNERS ARE SCARCE.  BEFORE THE HEALTH SCARE HAMMERED MARKETS, SOME AIRLINES HAD URGED THE EU TO LIFT WHAT THEN SEEMED THE ONLY SERIOUS OBSTACLE TO THE DEAL, FEARING EMBRAER\u2019S JETLINER BUSINESS WOULD STRUGGLE ON ITS OWN NOW THAT AIRBUS OWNS A COMPETITOR.  BUT EMBRAER HAS EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE IN ITS PORTFOLIO AND CONTINUES TO PUSH HARD TO MARKET ITS LATEST PLANE, THE E195-E2, WHICH IT SHOWCASED IN ENGLAND THIS WEEK.

FILE PHOTO: THE BOEING LOGO IS DISPLAYED ON A SCREEN, AT THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (NYSE) IN NEW YORK, U.S., AUGUST 7, 2019.

THE COMMENTS ON CREDIT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH REUTERS APPEARED TO UNDERSCORE THE U.S. PLANEMAKER\u2019S OPPOSITION TO GRANTING EQUITY AS PART OF AN INDUSTRY-WIDE GOVERNMENT BAILOUT DEAL.  U.S. LAWMAKERS HAVE SAID THEY COULD DEMAND STOCK OR EQUITY-BASED INSTRUMENTS LIKE WARRANTS OR OPTIONS AS A CONDITION OF GOVERNMENT LOANS.  \u201cHAVING ACCESS TO THE CREDIT MARKETS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US RIGHT NOW,\u201d BOEING CFO GREG SMITH SAID WHEN ASKED WHETHER BOEING COULD ISSUE SUCH INSTRUMENTS IN RETURN FOR SUPPORT.  CHIEF EXECUTIVE DAVE CALHOUN TOLD FOX BUSINESS EARLIER ON TUESDAY THAT BOEING COULD \u201cTAKE A DIFFERENT COURSE\u201d IF LAWMAKERS \u201cATTACH TOO MANY THINGS\u201d TO A STIMULUS PACKAGE.  BOEING HAS SOUGHT $60 BILLION IN U.S. GOVERNMENT LOANS OR LOAN GUARANTEES FOR ITSELF AND THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY.  CONGRESS WAS EXPECTED REACH AGREEMENT ON A STIMULUS AND RESCUE PACKAGE WORTH UP TO $2 TRILLION TO RESPOND TO ECONOMIC DAMAGE FROM THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC AS SOON AS TUESDAY.  SMITH SAID BOEING, WHICH DREW DOWN A $13.8 CREDIT LINE IT TOOK IN FEBRUARY BUT HAS A FURTHER $9.6 BILLION IN RESERVE, WAS NOT IN DISCUSSIONS TO ADD NEW COMMERCIAL DEBT FACILITIES.  \u201cNOT RIGHT NOW. THE MARKETS ESSENTIALLY ARE CLOSED,\u201d SMITH SAID. \u201cI MEAN, THERE\u2019S REALLY NOT MUCH OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE ANY ADDITIONAL DEBT. THAT\u2019S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES.\u201d  RATING AGENCY FITCH RATINGS MEANWHILE DOWNGRADED BOEING TO \u2018BBB\u2019 FROM \u2018A-\u2018, CITING THE RAPID ESCALATION OF THE PANDEMIC AND ITS EFFECT ON BOEING\u2019S AVIATION MARKETS AND OPERATIONS.  DESPITE SUCH IMMEDIATE PRESSURES, SMITH SAID BOEING WAS BEGINNING TO SEE SIGNS OF A RECOVERY IN CHINA, ECHOING COMMENTS BY AIRBUS (AIR.PA) CHIEF EXECUTIVE GUILLAUME FAURY ON MONDAY.  SMITH ALSO SAID A TIE-UP WITH BRAZIL PLANEMAKER EMBRAER (EMBR3.SA) REMAINED STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY.  \u201cAS YOU KNOW IT\u2019S IN THE MIDDLE OF REGULATORY APPROVAL AND SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO MONITOR THAT AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE EMBRAER TEAM,\u201d SMITH SAID.  \u201cSTRATEGICALLY, IT\u2019S STILL A GREAT PARTNERSHIP AND WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH THE REGULATORY HURDLES AND WE\u2019LL SEE HOW LONG THAT TAKES. BUT IT STILL REMAINS A PRIORITY FOR US.\u201d  SHARES IN EMBRAER SOARED AS MUCH AS 37% ON HIS COMMENTS. IN LATER TRADING THEY WERE UP 24%.  SMITH\u2019S COMMENTS WERE THE FIRST BY A SENIOR BOEING EXECUTIVE SINCE MARKET TURMOIL RAISED UNCERTAINTY OVER THE DEAL LAST WEEK, BECAUSE OF AN APPARENT MISMATCH BETWEEN EMBRAER\u2019S MARKET VALUE AND THE PRICE THAT BOEING IS DUE TO PAY FOR CONTROL OF ITS COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT UNIT.

BOEING SAYS IT BACKED OUT BECAUSE EMBRAER FAILED TO MEET UNNAMED CONDITIONS.  POTENTIAL DEALBREAKERS ARE OFTEN DESCRIBED IN CONTRACTS AS MATERIAL ADVERSE EVENTS. BUT BOEING AND EMBRAER WROTE OUT A LAUNDRY LIST IN THE CONTRACT SIGNED IN JANUARY 2019, WHICH REUTERS REVIEWED, OF 10 CONDITIONS THAT WOULD NOT QUALIFY AS THE KIND OF MATERIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT COULD BE A PRETEXT FOR CANCELLING THE DEAL. A PANDEMIC AND ANY CHANGES TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WERE AMONG THEM.  ON WEDNESDAY, S&P LOWERED BOEING\u2019S CREDIT RATING TO JUST ONE NOTCH ABOVE JUNK.

HOWEVER, JUST DAYS EARLIER, WHEN BOEING CALLED OFF ITS DEAL WITH EMBRAER, THE U.S. PLANEMAKER DID NOT MENTION ADVERSE CONDITIONS WITHIN THE COMPANY OR THE ECONOMY. INSTEAD, IT SAID ITS EX PARTNER \u201cFAILED TO SATISFY A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT CONDITIONS IN THE CONTRACT.\u201d  BOEING HAS NOT PUBLICLY DISCLOSED WHAT THOSE CONDITIONS WERE, BUT SOURCES TOLD REUTERS OVER THE WEEKEND THAT THE U.S. PLANEMAKER RAISED OBJECTIONS ABOUT FUNDING AND LEGAL MATTERS.  EMBRAER SAYS IT DID INDEED MEET ALL CONDITIONS AND HAS TAKEN BOEING TO ARBITRATION.  EITHER WAY, THE CONTRACT SAYS BOEING COULD HAVE WAIVED ANY UNMET CONDITIONS ON THE PART OF EMBRAER, BUT THE U.S. PLANEMAKER DECIDED NOT TO DO SO AND CANCELED THE DEAL INSTEAD.

THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS WORSENED IN MARCH AND BOEING STARTED OPENLY DISCUSSING SOME FORM OF U.S. GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE, AS IT WAS ALSO GETTING NEARER TO CLOSING THE EMBRAER DEAL. SEVERAL COUNTRIES HAD GRANTED ANTITRUST APPROVALS AND EMBRAER HAD FINISHED CARVING OUT ITS COMMERCIAL AVIATION UNIT AS WELL AS BUILT NEW HEADQUARTERS FOR AFTER BOEING\u2019S TAKEOVER.  BESIDES \u201cEPIDEMICS OR PANDEMICS,\u201d AND CHANGES IN THE WORLD\u2019S ECONOMY, WARS AND NATURAL DISASTERS WERE ALSO BARRED AS REASONS TO CANCEL THE DEAL.

NOW IT IS CONSIDERING WHETHER TO GRANT SIMILAR RIGHTS TO THE EU IN A PARALLEL CASE INVOLVING ILLEGAL SUPPORT FOR BOEING.  \u201cWITH WASHINGTON STATE\u2019S REPEAL OF THIS RELATIVELY MINOR TAX REDUCTION, THE UNITED STATES HAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE WTO\u2019S RECOMMENDATION, ENDING THIS DISPUTE,\u201d U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE ROBERT LIGHTHIZER SAID. \u201cTHIS STEP ENSURES THAT THERE IS NO VALID BASIS FOR THE EU TO RETALIATE AGAINST ANY U.S. GOODS.\u201d  WEDNESDAY\u2019S FORMAL U.S. SUBMISSION TO THE WTO AIMS TO NEUTRALIZE THE EU\u2019S DEMAND FOR SOME $10 BILLION IN ANNUAL TARIFFS, USTR SAID.  BUT THE EU\u2019S EXECUTIVE COMMISSION REJECTED THE MOVE AND SAID THE UNITED STATES REMAINED OUT OF STEP WITH THE WTO\u2019S RULE-SETTING DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BODY.  \u201cTHE EU DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE U.S. UNILATERAL ASSERTION THAT IT HAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE DSB RECOMMENDATIONS AND RULINGS IN THIS DISPUTE,\u201d IT SAID.  THE EU SAID IT WAS STILL STUDYING THE STATE TAX REPEAL, BUT LISTED OTHER MEASURES WHERE IT SAID THE UNITED STATES HAD FAILED TO COMPLY WITH WTO RULINGS ON AID FOR BOEING, INCLUDING RESEARCH SUPPORT FROM NASA AND THE PENTAGON.  THE UNITED STATES DENIES THAT ANY OTHER MEASURES ARE OUTSTANDING IN THE BOEING CASE AND SAID ON WEDNESDAY THAT THE ABOLITION OF TAX BREAKS BROUGHT THE MARATHON CASE TO A CLOSE.  EU TARIFF RULING AWAITED  THE SPAT BRINGS THE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY A STEP CLOSER TO AN EXPANDED TARIFF WAR.  THE UNITED STATES RAISED TARIFFS ON AIRBUS PLANES TO 15% FROM 10% ON MARCH 17, THOUGH THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT IS MUTED AS MANY AIRLINES DELAY DELIVERIES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC.  THE WTO IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE A DECISION ON THE EU TARIFF REQUEST IN JUNE.  EU OFFICIALS HAVE EMPHASIZED THEIR DESIRE TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THE DISPUTE, WHILE U.S. SOURCES HAVE SAID THIS HAS NOT LED TO CONCRETE PROPOSALS.  AIRBUS HAS SAID IT IS FOR THE WTO TO RULE ON COMPLIANCE WHILE BOEING SAYS IT HAS ADVOCATED AGAINST ITS OWN ECONOMIC INTEREST FOR THE TAX BREAKS TO BE REPEALED TO PROTECT RULES-BASED TRADE.  BOEING WAS REPORTED TO HAVE LOBBIED IN THE PAST FOR THE TAX BREAKS TO BE INTRODUCED AND LATER EXTENDED, WHILE AIRBUS LOST A SEPARATE BID TO PROVE THEY WERE A MORE SERIOUS WTO VIOLATION.  THE WTO DECISION ON EU RETALIATION IS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE WELL BEFORE ANY COMPLIANCE PROCEEDING COULD BE COMPLETED. EVEN WITHOUT AN APPEAL, IT COULD TAKE THE WTO UNTIL MID- TO LATE 2021 TO RULE ON THE COMPLIANCE ISSUE, EXPERTS SAID.  BOEING LAST WEEK DECLINED TO SEEK AID FROM A U.S. GOVERNMENT $17-BILLION CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUND FOR AEROSPACE AND OTHER NATIONAL SECURITY-LINKED FIRMS AFTER IT RAISED $25 BILLION IN A CORPORATE BOND OFFERING.

REUTERS/PAULO WHITAKER  THE AIRCRAFT HAS NOT FLOWN IN MORE THAN A YEAR BECAUSE OF TWO DEADLY CRASHES THAT FORCED REGULATORS TO SCRUTINIZE THE SAFETY OF ITS DESIGN.  THE TIMING OF THE PAYMENTS HAS BECOME A LIFELINE FOR GOL, WHICH, LIKE ITS PEERS WORLDWIDE, IS REELING FROM THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS.  BUT THE DISCLOSURE ALSO PROVIDES A POINT OF REFERENCE FOR WHAT KIND OF COMPENSATION OTHER AIRLINES WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN.  ACCORDING TO GOL, IT HAS ALREADY RECEIVED CLOSE TO 500 MILLION REAIS IN CASH. IN ADDITION, IT STANDS TO RECEIVE UP TO 1.9 BILLION REAIS IN CREDITS THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO NEW AIRCRAFT ACQUISITIONS, USED TO REDUCE INTEREST AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSES.  THAT AMOUNT IS THE MAXIMUM AND IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN UNDISCLOSED CONDITIONS. GOL SAID IT MAY RECEIVE LESS THAN THAT.  GOL, BRAZIL\u2019S LARGEST AIRLINE, IS ONE OF BOEING\u2019S BIGGEST CUSTOMERS AND HAD ORDERED MORE THAN 100 BOEING 737 MAX PLANES.

THE COMPANY FLIES BOEING 737 PLANES EXCLUSIVELY, REFLECTING THE BUSINESS MODEL OF SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO (LUV.N), WHICH HAS REACHED ONLY A PARTIAL SETTLEMENT WITH BOEING AND SAID IT WOULD SHARE $125 MILLION WITH EMPLOYEES.  IN A SECURITIES FILING, GOL SAID THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS CAUSED AN 80% DECREASE IN REVENUE IN APRIL TO 138 MILLION REAIS. APRIL WAS THE FIRST FULL MONTH OF TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD DUE TO THE PANDEMIC, AND GOL IS ONE OF THE FIRST AIRLINES TO REPORT ITS IMPACT.  GOL SHARES, WHICH ARE DOWN 73% SO FAR THIS YEAR, WERE LITTLE CHANGED IN AFTERNOON TRADING ON THE SAO PAULO STOCK EXCHANGE.  THE COMPANY SAYS IT HAS ENOUGH CASH ON HAND TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS AT THIS RATE FOR MORE THAN 10 MONTHS.  STILL, GOL SAID IT IS DISCUSSING ADDITIONAL FINANCING OF UP TO 1 BILLION REAIS WITH UNNAMED ENTITIES.

BOEING IS COMPETING WITH ARCH-RIVAL AIRBUS SE AND NUMEROUS OTHER FIRMS TO INTRODUCE SMALL SELF-FLYING VEHICLES CAPABLE OF VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND LANDING.  THE INVESTMENTS, FUELED BY LEAPS IN AUTONOMOUS TECHNOLOGY AS MUCH AS FRUSTRATION WITH ROAD CONGESTION, COULD CHANGE THE FACE OF THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE.  BOEING\u2019S 30-FOOT-LONG (9 METER) AIRCRAFT - PART HELICOPTER, PART DRONE AND PART FIXED-WING PLANE - LIFTED A FEW FEET OFF THE GROUND AND MADE A SOFT LANDING AFTER LESS THAN A MINUTE OF BEING AIRBORNE ON TUESDAY AT AN AIRPORT IN MANASSAS, VIRGINIA, BOEING SAID.  FUTURE FLIGHTS WILL TEST FORWARD, WING-BORNE FLIGHT.  \u201cTHIS IS WHAT REVOLUTION LOOKS LIKE, AND IT\u2019S BECAUSE OF AUTONOMY,\u201d JOHN LANGFORD, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF BOEING SUBSIDIARY AURORA FLIGHT SCIENCES, SAID IN A NEWS RELEASE ANNOUNCING THE TEST FLIGHT.  MAJOR HURDLES TO BOEING\u2019S VISION OF \u201cLOW-STRESS\u201d MOBILITY - AS IT IS CALLED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S MARKETING MATERIALS - INCLUDE SORTING OUT NUMEROUS CRITICAL SAFETY AND REGULATORY ISSUES TO MELD TRADITIONAL ROADWAY TRAFFIC WITH FLEETS OF FLYING CARS.  BOEING IS WORKING WITH STARTUP SPARKCOGNITION INC AND THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP A TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THREE-DIMENSIONAL HIGHWAYS, AS WELL AS THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT WILL ALLOW WAVES OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES TO ZIP SAFELY AROUND BUILDINGS, THE COMPANY HAS SAID.  BOEING BOUGHT MANASSAS-BASED AURORA FLIGHT SCIENCES LAST YEAR TO SPEED DEVELOPMENT OF A FLEET OF AUTONOMOUS AIR VEHICLES. WITH AURORA, BOEING IS ALSO WORKING ON UBER TECHNOLOGIES INC\u2019S UBERAIR SERVICE FOR FLIGHTS THAT ARE PLANNED TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ORDER VIA SMARTPHONES AROUND 2023.  BOEING IS LOOKING TO ACHIEVE A RANGE OF 50 MILES WITH TWO FLYING CAR VARIANTS CAPABLE OF CARRYING TWO AND FOUR PASSENGERS EACH. TESTS ARE PLANNED FOR LATER THIS YEAR ON A PACKAGE-HAULING VERSION THAT CAN LIFT UP TO 500 POUNDS (226.8 KG).  COMPETITORS RANGE FROM AIRBUS TO VOLOCOPTER, WHICH HAS TESTED DRONE TAXIS THAT RESEMBLE A SMALL HELICOPTER POWERED BY 18 ROTORS, AND AEROMOBIL, WITH A STRETCH-LIMOUSINE CONCEPT THAT CAN TURN INTO A FIXED-WING AIRCRAFT.

BOEING IS COMPETING WITH ARCH-RIVAL AIRBUS SE AND NUMEROUS OTHER FIRMS TO INTRODUCE SMALL SELF-FLYING VEHICLES CAPABLE OF VERTICAL TAKEOFF AND LANDING.  THE INVESTMENTS, FUELED BY LEAPS IN AUTONOMOUS TECHNOLOGY AS MUCH AS FRUSTRATION WITH ROAD CONGESTION, COULD CHANGE THE FACE OF THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE.  BOEING\u2019S 30-FOOT-LONG (9 METER) AIRCRAFT - PART HELICOPTER, PART DRONE AND PART FIXED-WING PLANE - LIFTED A FEW FEET OFF THE GROUND AND MADE A SOFT LANDING AFTER LESS THAN A MINUTE OF BEING AIRBORNE ON TUESDAY AT AN AIRPORT IN MANASSAS, VIRGINIA, BOEING SAID.  FUTURE FLIGHTS WILL TEST FORWARD, WING-BORNE FLIGHT.  \u201cTHIS IS WHAT REVOLUTION LOOKS LIKE, AND IT\u2019S BECAUSE OF AUTONOMY,\u201d JOHN LANGFORD, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF BOEING SUBSIDIARY AURORA FLIGHT SCIENCES, SAID IN A NEWS RELEASE ANNOUNCING THE TEST FLIGHT.  MAJOR HURDLES TO BOEING\u2019S VISION OF \u201cLOW-STRESS\u201d MOBILITY - AS IT IS CALLED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S MARKETING MATERIALS - INCLUDE SORTING OUT NUMEROUS CRITICAL SAFETY AND REGULATORY ISSUES TO MELD TRADITIONAL ROADWAY TRAFFIC WITH FLEETS OF FLYING CARS.  BOEING IS WORKING WITH STARTUP SPARKCOGNITION INC AND THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP A TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THREE-DIMENSIONAL HIGHWAYS, AS WELL AS THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT WILL ALLOW WAVES OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES TO ZIP SAFELY AROUND BUILDINGS, THE COMPANY HAS SAID.  BOEING BOUGHT MANASSAS-BASED AURORA FLIGHT SCIENCES LAST YEAR TO SPEED DEVELOPMENT OF A FLEET OF AUTONOMOUS AIR VEHICLES. WITH AURORA, BOEING IS ALSO WORKING ON UBER TECHNOLOGIES INC\u2019S [UBER.UL] UBERAIR SERVICE FOR FLIGHTS THAT ARE PLANNED TO BE AVAILABLE FOR ORDER VIA SMARTPHONES AROUND 2023.  BOEING IS LOOKING TO ACHIEVE A RANGE OF 50 MILES WITH TWO FLYING CAR VARIANTS CAPABLE OF CARRYING TWO AND FOUR PASSENGERS EACH. TESTS ARE PLANNED FOR LATER THIS YEAR ON A PACKAGE-HAULING VERSION THAT CAN LIFT UP TO 500 POUNDS (226.8 KG).  SLIDESHOW (4 IMAGES)  COMPETITORS RANGE FROM AIRBUS, WHICH SAYS IT HAS ALREADY CONDUCTED NUMEROUS FLYING VEHICLE TEST FLIGHTS, TO VOLOCOPTER, WHICH HAS TESTED DRONE TAXIS THAT RESEMBLE A SMALL HELICOPTER POWERED BY 18 ROTORS, AND AEROMOBIL, WITH A STRETCH-LIMOUSINE CONCEPT THAT CAN TURN INTO A FIXED-WING AIRCRAFT.

BOEING SAID IT HAD PAUSED DELIVERIES OF ITS FASTEST-SELLING 737 MAX AIRCRAFT BUILT AT ITS FACTORY NEAR SEATTLE BUT CONTINUES TO PRODUCE ITS SINGLE-AISLE JETS AT FULL SPEED WHILE DEALING WITH THE WORLDWIDE FLEET\u2019S GROUNDING.  INVESTIGATORS IN FRANCE WILL BE SEEKING CLUES INTO SUNDAY\u2019S DEADLY ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH AFTER TAKE-OFF FROM ADDIS ABABA KILLED 157 PEOPLE FROM 35 NATIONS IN THE SECOND SUCH CALAMITY INVOLVING BOEING\u2019S PLANE SINCE OCTOBER.  POSSIBLE LINKS BETWEEN THE ACCIDENTS HAVE ROCKED THE AVIATION INDUSTRY, SCARED PASSENGERS, AND LEFT THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST PLANEMAKER SCRAMBLING TO PROVE THE SAFETY OF A MONEY-SPINNING MODEL INTENDED TO BE THE STANDARD FOR DECADES.

BOEING HAS SAID IT WOULD ROLL OUT THE SOFTWARE IMPROVEMENT \u201cACROSS THE 737 MAX FLEET IN THE COMING WEEKS.\u201d  RELATIVES OF THE DEAD STORMED OUT OF A MEETING WITH ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES ON THURSDAY, DECRYING A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY, WHILE OTHERS MADE THE PAINFUL TRIP TO THE CRASH SCENE.  \u201cI CAN\u2019T FIND YOU! WHERE ARE YOU?\u201d SAID ONE ETHIOPIAN WOMAN, DRAPED IN TRADITIONAL WHITE MOURNING SHAWL, AS SHE HELD A FRAMED PORTRAIT OF HER BROTHER IN THE CHARRED AND DEBRIS-STREWN FIELD.  AFTER AN APPARENT TUSSLE OVER WHERE THE INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE HELD, THE FLIGHT DATA AND COCKPIT VOICE RECORDERS WERE HANDED OVER TO FRANCE\u2019S BUREAU OF ENQUIRY AND ANALYSIS FOR CIVIL AVIATION SAFETY (BEA).  TECHNICAL ANALYSIS WOULD BEGIN ON FRIDAY AND THE FIRST CONCLUSIONS COULD TAKE SEVERAL DAYS, THE BEA SAID, POSTING A PICTURE OF THE PARTLY CRUMPLED, ORANGE-CASED BOX.  NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING AN INITIALLY RELUCTANT UNITED STATES, HAVE SUSPENDED THE 371 MAX MODELS IN OPERATION, THOUGH AIRLINES ARE LARGELY COPING BY SWITCHING PLANES.  NEARLY 5,000 MAXS ARE ON ORDER, MEANING THE FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS ARE HUGE FOR THE INDUSTRY. MOODY\u2019S RATING AGENCY SAID THE FALLOUT FROM THE CRASH WOULD NOT IMMEDIATELY AFFECT BOEING\u2019S CREDIT RATING.  \u201cWE CONTINUE TO BUILD 737 MAX AIRPLANES WHILE ASSESSING HOW THE SITUATION, INCLUDING POTENTIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS, WILL IMPACT OUR PRODUCTION SYSTEM,\u201d BOEING SPOKESMAN CHAZ BICKERS SAID.

CONNECTION TO INDONESIA CRASH?  THE INVESTIGATION OF SUNDAY\u2019S CRASH HAS ADDED URGENCY SINCE THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) ON WEDNESDAY GROUNDED THE 737 MAX AIRCRAFT, CITING SATELLITE DATA AND EVIDENCE FROM THE SCENE THAT INDICATED SOME SIMILARITIES AND \u201cTHE POSSIBILITY OF A SHARED CAUSE\u201d WITH OCTOBER\u2019S CRASH IN INDONESIA THAT KILLED 189 PEOPLE.

REUTERS/BAZ RATNER/FILE PHOTO  THOUGH IT MAINTAINS THE PLANES ARE SAFE, BOEING HAS SUPPORTED THE FAA MOVE. ITS STOCK IS DOWN ABOUT 11 PERCENT SINCE THE CRASH, WIPING MORE THAN $26 BILLION OFF ITS MARKET VALUE. IT FELL 1 PERCENT ON THURSDAY.  U.S. AND CANADIAN CARRIERS WRESTLED WITH CUSTOMER CALLS AND FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS AND SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO AND AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC, THE LARGEST U.S. OPERATORS OF THE 737 MAX, SAID THEY HAD STARTED FLYING EMPTY MAX AIRCRAFT TO BE PARKED ELSEWHERE DURING THE BAN.  U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, AN AVIATION ENTHUSIAST WITH DEEP TIES TO BOEING, SAID HE HOPED THE SUSPENSIONS WOULD BE SHORT. \u201cTHEY HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT FAST,\u201d TRUMP TOLD REPORTERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE.  A SOFTWARE FIX FOR THE 737 MAX THAT BOEING HAS BEEN WORKING ON SINCE THE LION AIR CRASH IN OCTOBER IN INDONESIA WILL TAKE MONTHS TO COMPLETE, THE FAA SAID ON WEDNESDAY.  AND IN WHAT MAY PRESAGE A RAFT OF CLAIMS, NORWEGIAN AIR HAS SAID IT WILL SEEK COMPENSATION FROM BOEING FOR COSTS AND LOST REVENUE AFTER GROUNDING ITS FLEET OF 737 MAX.  JAPAN BECAME THE LATEST NATION TO SUSPEND THE 737 MAX PLANES ON THURSDAY. AND AIRLINE GARUDA INDONESIA SAID THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY IT WOULD CANCEL ITS 20-STRONG ORDER OF 737 MAXS.  WHAT HAPPENED?  UNDER INTERNATIONAL RULES, ETHIOPIANS ARE LEADING THE INVESTIGATION BUT FRANCE\u2019S BEA WILL CONDUCT BLACK BOX ANALYSIS AS AN ADVISER. THE U.S. NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (NTSB) WAS ALSO SENDING THREE INVESTIGATORS TO ASSIST.  ONLY FRANCE AND THE UNITED STATES HAVE THE EXPERIENCE GLEANED FROM BEING PRESENT AT ALMOST EVERY CRASH INVOLVING AN AIRBUS OR BOEING RESPECTIVELY.  SLIDESHOW (15 IMAGES)  THE CAUSE OF THE INDONESIAN CRASH IS STILL BEING INVESTIGATED.

CANADA SAID IT WOULD INDEPENDENTLY CERTIFY THE 737 MAX IN THE FUTURE, RATHER THAN ACCEPTING FAA VALIDATION, AND WOULD CONDUCT AN \u201cEXHAUSTIVE REVIEW\u201d OF THE AUTOMATED FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM IN MAX AIRCRAFT, KNOWN AS MCAS, WHICH EXPERTS BELIEVE MAY HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN BOTH CRASHES.  CANADA ALSO SAID IT WOULD SEND A TEAM TO HELP U.S. AUTHORITIES EVALUATE PROPOSED DESIGN CHANGES AND DECIDE IF OTHERS WERE NEEDED.  BOEING CO DECLINED TO COMMENT. THE COMPANY ON TUESDAY RESHUFFLED THE TOP EXECUTIVES IN ITS COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES UNIT TO FOCUS ON THE ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS.  U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS DO NOT BELIEVE THE TWO CRASHES WILL LEAD TO A WORLDWIDE SHIFT AWAY FROM FAA CERTIFICATIONS BUT U.S. LAWMAKERS, AS WELL AS FEDERAL PROSECUTORS, ARE SCRUTINIZING THE CERTIFICATION OF THE BOEING 737 MAX.  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND ANOTHER KEY DEMOCRAT ASKED THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT\u2019S INSPECTOR GENERAL ON TUESDAY TO EXAMINE KEY DECISIONS MADE BY THE FAA IN CERTIFYING THE 737 MAX JET FOR USE.  THE FAA DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THAT REQUEST OR ON ACTIONS TAKEN BY OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT \u201cTHE CURRENT, HISTORIC AVIATION SAFETY RECORD IN THE U.S. AND GLOBALLY IS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE FAA\u2019S ROBUST PROCESSES AND FULL COLLABORATION WITH THE AVIATION COMMUNITY.\u201d  THE U.S. TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT\u2019S INSPECTOR GENERAL PLANS TO AUDIT THE FAA\u2019S CERTIFICATION OF THE JET, AN OFFICIAL WITH THE OFFICE SAID ON TUESDAY. THE OFFICE CAN RECOMMEND CHANGES OR IMPROVEMENTS TO HOW THE FAA OPERATES. BOEING SAID IT WOULD COOPERATE WITH THE AUDIT.  UNUSUAL INTERVENTION  THE UNUSUAL PUBLIC INTERVENTION BY TWO LEADING REGULATORS CAME AS A PROBE INTO THE FINAL MINUTES OF ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 302 TURNED TOWARD SECRETS HIDDEN IN THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER.  THE VOICES OF CAPTAIN YARED GETACHEW AND FIRST OFFICER AHMEDNUR MOHAMMED COULD HELP EXPLAIN THE MARCH 10 CRASH OF THE BOEING 737 MAX THAT HAS WORRYING PARALLELS WITH ANOTHER DISASTER INVOLVING THE SAME MODEL OFF INDONESIA IN OCTOBER.  THE TWIN DISASTERS KILLED 346 PEOPLE, BUT THERE IS NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE SO FAR THAT THEY ARE LINKED.  BLACK BOX DATA WAS DOWNLOADED IN FRANCE BUT ONLY ETHIOPIAN EXPERTS LEADING THE PROBE HAVE ACCESS TO THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN GETACHEW, 29, AND MOHAMMED, 25. THE DATA WAS BACK IN ADDIS ABABA ON TUESDAY, SOURCES FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBE TOLD REUTERS.  EXPERTS BELIEVE THE NEW MCAS SYSTEM, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO STOP STALLING BY DIPPING THE NOSE, MAY HAVE BEEN A FACTOR IN BOTH CRASHES, WITH PILOTS UNABLE TO OVERRIDE IT AS THEIR JETS PLUNGED DOWNWARDS.  BOTH CAME DOWN JUST MINUTES AFTER TAKE-OFF AFTER ERRATIC FLIGHT PATTERNS AND LOSS OF CONTROL REPORTED BY THE PILOTS. HOWEVER, EVERY ACCIDENT IS A UNIQUE CHAIN OF HUMAN AND TECHNICAL FACTORS, EXPERTS SAY.  THE PRESTIGE OF ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES, ONE OF AFRICA\u2019S MOST SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES, AND BOEING, THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST PLANEMAKER AND A MASSIVE U.S. EXPORTER, ARE AT STAKE.  AWKWARD QUESTIONS FOR INDUSTRY  LAWMAKERS AND SAFETY EXPERTS ARE QUESTIONING HOW THOROUGHLY REGULATORS VETTED THE MAX MODEL AND HOW WELL PILOTS WERE TRAINED ON NEW FEATURES. FOR NOW, GLOBAL REGULATORS HAVE GROUNDED THE EXISTING FLEET OF MORE THAN 300 MAX AIRCRAFT, AND DELIVERIES OF NEARLY 5,000 MORE - WORTH WELL OVER $500 BILLION - ARE ON HOLD. (GRAPHIC: TMSNRT.RS/2HV2BTC)  PRESSURE ON CHICAGO-HEADQUARTERED BOEING HAS GROWN WITH NEWS THAT FEDERAL PROSECUTORS ARE SCRUTINISING HOW CAREFULLY THE MAX MODEL WAS DEVELOPED, TWO PEOPLE BRIEFED ON THE MATTER SAID.  THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO LOOKING AT THE FAA\u2019S OVERSIGHT OF BOEING, ONE OF THE PEOPLE SAID. AND A FEDERAL GRAND JURY LAST WEEK ISSUED AT LEAST ONE SUBPOENA TO AN ENTITY INVOLVED IN THE PLANE\u2019S DEVELOPMENT.  U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP PLANS TO NOMINATE FORMER DELTA AIR LINES EXECUTIVE STEVE DICKSON TO HEAD THE FAA ON TUESDAY. THE AGENCY HAS BEEN WITHOUT A PERMANENT HEAD FOR 14 MONTHS.  IN THE HOPE OF GETTING ITS MAX LINE BACK INTO THE AIR SOON, BOEING HAS SAID IT WILL ROLL OUT A SOFTWARE UPDATE AND REVISE PILOT TRAINING. IN THE CASE OF THE LION AIR CRASH IN INDONESIA, IT HAS RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER CREW USED THE CORRECT PROCEDURES.  DEVELOPMENT OF THE 737 MAX, WHICH OFFERS COST SAVINGS OF ABOUT 15 PERCENT ON FUEL, BEGAN IN 2011 AFTER THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH BY ITS MAIN RIVAL OF THE AIRBUS A320NEO. THE 737 MAX ENTERED SERVICE IN 2017 AFTER SIX YEARS OF PREPARATION.  ARGUS RESEARCH CUT BOEING STOCK TO \u201cHOLD\u201d FROM \u201cBUY\u201d, GIVING THE PLANEMAKER AT LEAST ITS FOURTH DOWNGRADE SINCE THE CRASH, REFINITIV DATA SHOWED. ITS SHARES ROSE 0.3 PERCENT ON TUESDAY, TO CLOSE AT $373.43. THEY ARE STILL DOWN MORE THAN 11 PERCENT SINCE THE CRASH IN ETHIOPIA.  GLOBAL RAMIFICATIONS  VARIOUS FIRMS ARE RECONSIDERING BOEING ORDERS, AND SOME ARE REVISING FINANCIAL FORECASTS GIVEN THEY NOW CANNOT COUNT ON MAINTENANCE AND FUEL SAVINGS FACTORED IN FROM THE MAX.  AIR CANADA SAID IT INTENDED TO KEEP ITS MAX AIRCRAFT GROUNDED UNTIL AT LEAST JULY 1, WOULD ACCELERATE INTAKE OF RECENTLY ACQUIRED AIRBUS A321 PLANES, AND HAD HIRED OTHER CARRIERS TO PROVIDE EXTRA CAPACITY MEANTIME.

REUTERS/LINDSEY WASSON  BOEING HAS BEEN WORKING ON A SOFTWARE UPGRADE FOR AN ANTI-STALL SYSTEM AND PILOT DISPLAYS ON ITS FASTEST-SELLING JETLINER IN THE WAKE OF THE DEADLY LION AIR CRASH IN INDONESIA IN OCTOBER.  SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE FLIGHT PATH IN THE LION AIR INCIDENT AND A FATAL ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH ON MARCH 10 HAVE RAISED FRESH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SYSTEM. THE TWO CRASHES KILLED A TOTAL OF 346 PEOPLE.  AMERICAN IS THE SECOND-LARGEST U.S. OPERATOR OF THE MAX IN THE UNITED STATES WITH 24 JETS, BEHIND SOUTHWEST AIRLINES WITH 34.  \u201cTHIS AIRPLANE CAN BE A SAFE AIRPLANE, AND THERE HAVE BEEN GREAT STRIDES ON GETTING A FIX IN THE WORKS, BUT I\u2019LL HAVE A BETTER FEEL AFTER WE CAN TEST IT OUT,\u201d SAID MIKE MICHAELIS, SAFETY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN OF THE ALLIED PILOTS ASSOCIATION (APA), WHICH REPRESENTS AMERICAN AIRLINES PILOTS.  MICHAELIS SAID ONE APA PILOT AND ONE PILOT FROM AMERICAN\u2019S MANAGEMENT TEAM WOULD TEST THE SOFTWARE FIX IN RENTON, WASHINGTON, WHERE BOEING BUILDS THE MAX AND HAS TWO SIMULATORS.  \u201cWE HAVE BEEN ENGAGING WITH ALL 737 MAX OPERATORS AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO SCHEDULE MEETINGS TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PLANS FOR SUPPORTING THE 737 MAX FLEET,\u201d BOEING SPOKESMAN PAUL BERGMAN SAID.  MAX JETS WERE GROUNDED WORLDWIDE IN THE WAKE OF THE ETHIOPIAN CRASH.  BOEING HAS INDICATED IT WOULD DEPLOY THE SOFTWARE UPDATE BY APRIL OR SOONER, THOUGH IT WAS UNCLEAR HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO GET THE JETS FLYING AGAIN. PILOTS MUST COMPLETE FAA-APPROVED COMPUTER-BASED TRAINING ON THE CHANGES, FOLLOWED BY A MANDATORY TEST, AND SOME PILOTS HAVE SAID MORE MAY BE NEEDED.  AFTER LION AIR, AMERICAN PILOTS MET WITH BOEING EXECUTIVES IN FORT WORTH, TEXAS AND DEMANDED TO KNOW WHY THE MANUFACTURER HAD NOT TOLD THEM ABOUT THE NEW SYSTEM, KNOWN AS MCAS.  THEY ALSO QUESTIONED WHETHER A 56-MINUTE IPAD COURSE ON THE MAX HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT.  RELATED COVERAGE INDONESIA'S GARUDA ASKS TO CANCEL 737 MAX ORDER IT HAD BEEN RECONSIDERING BEFORE ETHIOPIA CRASH  MAX SIMULATOR TRAINING IS NOT REQUIRED, PARTLY BECAUSE FEW SIMULATORS EXIST.

REUTERS/LINDSEY WASSON  INVESTIGATORS LOOKING TO UNCOVER THE CAUSES MUST ANSWER ONE OF THE BIGGEST QUESTIONS: WAS THE PLANE\u2019S SOFTWARE TO BLAME?  WHAT WE KNOW  - BOEING HAS STOPPED DELIVERY OF ALL NEW MAX JETS. ITS SHARES HAVE FALLEN 12 PERCENT SINCE THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH, WIPING $28 BILLION FROM ITS MARKET VALUE.  - BOEING MAINTAINS ITS NEW, FUEL-EFFICIENT JETS ARE SAFE, BUT SUPPORTED THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) DECISION TO GROUND THEM.  - EUROPE AND CANADA SAID THEY WOULD INDEPENDENTLY CERTIFY THE SAFETY OF THE JETS, FURTHER COMPLICATING PLANS TO GET THE AIRCRAFT FLYING.  - BOEING WILL MANDATE ON MAX JETS A PREVIOUSLY OPTIONAL COCKPIT WARNING LIGHT, WHICH MIGHT HAVE WARNED OF PROBLEMS THAT POSSIBLY PLAYED A ROLE IN THE RECENT CRASHES OF ETHIOPIAN AND INDONESIAN PLANES, SOURCES SAID.  - INDONESIA\u2019S FLAG CARRIER GARUDA SAID ON FRIDAY IT SENT A LETTER TO BOEING ASKING TO CANCEL AN ORDER FOR 49 MAX 8 AIRCRAFT, BECOMING THE FIRST AIRLINE TO CONFIRM PLANS TO CANCEL AN ORDER AFTER THE CRASHES.  - INVESTIGATORS HAVE FOUND SIMILARITIES IN THE \u2018ANGLE OF ATTACK\u2019 DATA FROM BOTH FLIGHTS. A PIECE OF A STABILIZER IN THE WRECKAGE OF THE ETHIOPIAN JET WITH THE TRIM SET IN AN UNUSUAL POSITION WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE LION AIR PLANE, SOURCES SAID.  - INVESTIGATORS WHO VERIFIED DATA FROM THE BLACK BOX RECORDERS OF THE ETHIOPIAN PLANE HAVE FOUND \u2018CLEAR SIMILARITIES\u2019 WITH THE DOOMED LION AIR FLIGHT, FRENCH AIR ACCIDENT AUTHORITY BEA HAS ALSO SAID.  - EXPERTS BELIEVE A NEW FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM, MCAS, ON THE JETS, DESIGNED TO STOP STALLING BY DIPPING THE NOSE, MAY HAVE BEEN A FACTOR IN BOTH CRASHES, WITH PILOTS UNABLE TO OVERRIDE IT AS THEIR JETS PLUNGED AFTER A FAULTY SENSOR INDICATED A STALL. BUT NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE YET LINKS THE TWO ACCIDENTS.  - THE PILOT OF THE ETHIOPIAN FLIGHT HAD REPORTED INTERNAL CONTROL PROBLEMS AND RECEIVED PERMISSION TO RETURN. THE PILOT OF THE LION AIR FLIGHT, WHICH CRASHED ON OCT. 29 WITH THE LOSS OF ALL 189 ABOARD, HAD ALSO ASKED TO RETURN SOON AFTER TAKE-OFF FROM JAKARTA.  - INVESTIGATORS CONFIRMED A REUTERS REPORT THAT THE LION AIR PILOTS SCRAMBLED THROUGH A HANDBOOK TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE JET WAS LURCHING DOWNWARDS IN THE FINAL MINUTES BEFORE IT HIT THE WATER.  - INDONESIA HAS ADVANCED THE DATE FOR THE RELEASE OF ITS REPORT ON THE LION AIR CRASH TO BETWEEN JULY AND AUGUST, VERSUS A PREVIOUS SCHEDULE OF BETWEEN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER.  - BOEING\u2019S COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DIVISION HAS BROUGHT IN A NEW VICE PRESIDENT OF ENGINEERING WHILE DEDICATING ANOTHER TOP EXECUTIVE TO THE AIRCRAFT INVESTIGATIONS, A COMPANY EMAIL SHOWED.  WHAT\u2019S NEXT?  - U.S. LAWMAKERS SAID THE PLANES COULD BE GROUNDED FOR WEEKS TO UPGRADE AND INSTALL THE SOFTWARE IN EVERY PLANE.

BOEING, IN THE MIDST OF ONE ITS WORST CRISES IN YEARS, IS UNDER PRESSURE FROM CRASH VICTIMS\u2019 FAMILIES, AIRLINES, LAWMAKERS IN WASHINGTON AND REGULATORS AROUND THE WORLD TO PROVE THAT THE AUTOMATED FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEMS ABOARD ITS 737 MAX AIRCRAFT ARE SAFE, AND THAT PILOTS HAVE THE TRAINING REQUIRED TO OVERRIDE THE SYSTEM IN AN EMERGENCY.  A BOEING OFFICIAL IN SEATTLE SAID ON WEDNESDAY THE TIMING OF THE SOFTWARE UPGRADE WAS \u201c100 PERCENT INDEPENDENT OF THE TIMING OF THE ETHIOPIAN ACCIDENT,\u201d AND THE COMPANY WAS TAKING STEPS TO MAKE THE ANTI-STALL SYSTEM \u201cMORE ROBUST.\u201d  THERE WAS NO NEED TO OVERHAUL BOEING\u2019S REGULATORY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) NOW, THE COMPANY SAID.  \u201cWE ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT ACCIDENTS LIKE THESE NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN,\u201d MIKE SINNETT, VICE PRESIDENT FOR PRODUCT STRATEGY AND FUTURE AIRPLANE DEVELOPMENT TOLD REPORTERS.  THE FAA SAID IT HAD NOT REVIEWED OR CERTIFIED THE SOFTWARE UPGRADE YET.  U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY ELAINE CHAO AND SOME LAWMAKERS ON WEDNESDAY QUESTIONED WHY BOEING DID NOT REQUIRE SAFETY FEATURES ON ITS TOP-SELLING PLANE THAT MIGHT HAVE PREVENTED THE CRASHES.  \u201cIT IS VERY QUESTIONABLE IF THESE WERE SAFETY-ORIENTED ADDITIONS, WHY THEY WERE NOT PART OF THE REQUIRED TEMPLATE OF MEASURES THAT SHOULD GO INTO AN AIRPLANE,\u201d SHE SAID, ADDING SHE WAS NOT READY TO REQUIRE THAT ALL SAFETY OPTIONS BE RETROFITTED ON EXISTING AIRPLANE.  A SPOKESMAN FOR THE FAA SAID THE AGENCY HAD NOT REVIEWED OR CERTIFIED THE SOFTWARE UPGRADE YET.  EXECUTIVES WITH U.S. AIRLINES WELCOMED BOEING\u2019S MOVES, BUT WANT U.S. REGULATORS TO SIGN OFF ON THE UPGRADE.  SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO, WHICH ON WEDNESDAY BECAME THE FIRST MAJOR AIRLINE TO FORMALLY CUT ITS FINANCIAL OUTLOOK FOR THE YEAR AFTER BEING FORCED TO PULL ITS MAX FLEET OF 34 JETS OUT OF SERVICE, SUPPORTED BOEING\u2019S DECISION.  \u201cBOEING\u2019S SOFTWARE UPDATE APPEARS TO ADD YET ANOTHER LAYER OF SAFETY TO THE OPERATION OF THE MAX AIRCRAFT,\u201d SOUTHWEST\u2019S CERTIFICATE CHIEF PILOT BOB WALTZ SAID.  ALLIED PILOTS ASSOCIATION, WHICH REPRESENTS AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC PILOTS, SAID IT WAS PLEASED WITH BOEING\u2019S PROGRESS BUT WARNED THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS SHOULD NOT BE RUSHED. THE FIX SHOULD BE FULLY VETTED AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANY FURTHER INFORMATION FROM AN INVESTIGATION INTO AN ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH ON MARCH 10, THE ASSOCIATION SAID IN A STATEMENT.  UNITED AIRLINES VICE PRESIDENT MICHAEL QUIELLO SAID THE AIRLINE WAS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE SOFTWARE UPDATE, BUT WAS COUNTING ON THE FAA TO CERTIFY THE CHANGE.  AIRLINE STOCKS TURNED POSITIVE AFTER BOEING UNVEILED THE SOFTWARE FIX. CFRA ANALYST JIM CORRIDORE, WHO HAS A \u201cBUY\u201d RATING ON BOEING, SAID NEWS FROM THE COMPANY AND THE WASHINGTON HEARING WERE POSITIVE STEPS TOWARD GETTING THE MAX JETS AIRBORNE AGAIN.  THE ANGLE OF ATTACK SENSOR, AT BOTTOM CENTER, IS SEEN ON A 737 MAX AIRCRAFT AT THE BOEING FACTORY IN RENTON, WASHINGTON, U.S., MARCH 27, 2019. REUTERS/LINDSEY WASSON  EXTRA COMPUTER TRAINING  THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST PLANEMAKER SAID THE ANTI-STALL SYSTEM, WHICH IS BELIEVED TO HAVE REPEATEDLY FORCED THE NOSE LOWER IN AT LEAST ONE OF THE ACCIDENTS, IN INDONESIA LAST OCTOBER, WOULD ONLY DO SO ONE TIME AFTER SENSING A PROBLEM, GIVING PILOTS MORE CONTROL.  IT WILL ALSO BE DISABLED IF TWO AIRFLOW SENSORS THAT MEASURE THE \u201cANGLE OF ATTACK,\u201d OR ANGLE OF THE WING TO THE AIRFLOW, A FUNDAMENTAL PARAMETER OF FLIGHT, OFFER WIDELY DIFFERENT READINGS, BOEING SAID. REUTERS REPORTED THOSE DETAILS EARLIER THIS WEEK.  THE ANTI-STALL SYSTEM - KNOWN AS MCAS, OR MANEUVERING CHARACTERISTICS AUGMENTATION SYSTEM - HAS BEEN PINPOINTED BY INVESTIGATORS AS A POSSIBLE CAUSE IN A FATAL LION AIR CRASH IN INDONESIA AND THE ONE IN ETHIOPIA.  EXISTING 737 PILOTS WILL ALSO HAVE EXTRA COMPUTER-BASED TRAINING FOLLOWING CRITICISM THAT MCAS WAS NOT DESCRIBED IN THE AIRCRAFT MANUAL.  BOEING HAS PREVIOUSLY SAID EXISTING COCKPIT PROCEDURES WOULD COVER ANY EXAMPLE OF RUNAWAY CONTROLS CAUSED BY MCAS.  THE CHANGES WERE DRAWN UP IN RESPONSE TO THE LION AIR CRASH BUT ARE SEEN AS CRUCIAL TO REGAINING THE TRUST OF PILOTS, PASSENGERS AND REGULATORS AFTER THE ETHIOPIA CRASH PROMPTED A WORLDWIDE GROUNDING OF BOEING 737 MAX PLANES.  ETHIOPIAN OFFICIALS AND SOME ANALYSTS HAVE SAID THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES JET BEHAVED IN A SIMILAR PATTERN BEFORE CRASHING SHORTLY AFTER TAKE-OFF FROM ADDIS ABABA, BUT THAT INVESTIGATION IS STILL AT AN EARLY STAGE.  BOEING\u2019S SINNETT SAID THE SOFTWARE HAD BEEN THROUGH EXTENSIVE TESTING, INCLUDING FLIGHTS WITH THE FAA. HOWEVER, HE SAID HE COULD PROVIDE NO TIMEFRAME FOR WHEN THE 737 MAX JETS WOULD RETURN TO SERVICE.  BOEING SAID IT WOULD CHANGE THE DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM SO THAT IT NO LONGER RELIED ON A SINGLE SENSOR. THE CHANGES ALSO WOULD MAKE STANDARD VISUAL WARNINGS TO THE PILOTS IF THE SYSTEM HAD STOPPED WORKING. PREVIOUSLY, THOSE WARNING MESSAGES AND DISPLAYS HAD BEEN OPTIONAL.  SLIDESHOW (4 IMAGES)  REUTERS REPORTED IN NOVEMBER AFTER THE LION AIR DISASTER THAT SOME AVIATION EXPERTS BELIEVED THE OPTIONAL ALERT COULD HAVE ALERTED ENGINEERS ABOUT MECHANICAL FAULTS, LEADING TO AN INDUSTRY DEBATE OVER WHETHER THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE MANDATORY.  CURRENT 737 MAX PILOTS HAVE CRITICIZED BOEING FOR NOT DISCLOSING MORE DETAILS ABOUT MCAS INITIALLY. SINNETT SAID THE COMPANY HAS ADDED DETAILS ON MCAS TO ITS FLIGHT CREW OPERATIONS MANUAL. ALL PILOTS WILL NEED TO COMPLETE THIS TRAINING BEFORE RETURNING TO THE SKIES, HE SAID.  JOHN HAMILTON, CHIEF ENGINEER FOR 737 MAX FLIGHT DISPLAYS, SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT \u201cALL PRIMARY FLIGHT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY OPERATE THE 737 MAX\u201d WAS ALREADY INCLUDED WITHOUT THE FEATURES THAT WOULD NOW BE OFFERED.", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2019-03-28T00:00:00", "key": "20190328BA", "labelr0": 0.06146281499693172, "labelr1": 1.864117081508391, "labelr2": 2.653243144040691, "labelr3": -0.20176738008888506, "labelr4": -1.5380678182981424, "pos": 0.268, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.5267, "0_day_return": 0.061462814996926525, "1_day_return": 0.061462814996926525, "2_day_return": 4.566819784211118, "3_day_return": 4.355838051490246, "4_day_return": 2.75077448990495, "label": 1, "return": 0.006734280040534532, "excess_return": 0.05472853495639199, "count_of_word": 956, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.6534746, "prof1": 0.34652537, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5349265727152221, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4650734272847779, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.6534746, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.34652537, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.4586097, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.5413903, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.48762652, "tr_prof1": 0.51237345, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.46626937, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.53373057, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.59375757, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.40624246, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.6068903, "headline_prof21": 0.39310968, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.36983472, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.6301653, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.41631344, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.5836865999999999, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.43284570000000006, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.5671543000000001, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": 0.061462814996926525, "returnpredvader": 0.061462814996926525, "returnpredsgd": -0.061462814996926525, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0006146281499693, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9999998111161008, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9999998111161008, "cumreturn1b": 1.1466279207353132, "cumreturn1d": 1.076259778906625, "cumreturn1e": 1.1541743579686667, "cumreturndow": 1.1194577944374706, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1064952193979283}, {"Unnamed: 0": 4420, "Unnamed: 0.1": 4420, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 4420, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 4420, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 4420, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 4420, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 4420, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 4420, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 4420, "level_0": 4420, "index": 4420, "text": "(REUTERS) - TOUR OPERATOR TUI WARNED ITS PROFIT WOULD FALL BY AT LEAST 200 MILLION EUROS ($225 MILLION) THIS YEAR AFTER THE GROUNDING OF BOEING\u2019S 737 MAX AIRCRAFT, FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF TWO FATAL CRASHES INVOLVING THE SAME TYPE OF PLANE.

REUTERS/TIKSA NEGERI/FILE PHOTO  INVESTIGATORS LOOKING TO UNCOVER THE CAUSES MUST ANSWER ONE OF THE BIGGEST QUESTIONS: WAS THE PLANE\u2019S SOFTWARE TO BLAME?  WHAT WE KNOW     BOEING HAS STOPPED DELIVERY OF ALL NEW MAX JETS. ITS STOCK HAS FALLEN 7.5 PERCENT SINCE THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH.     BOEING MAINTAINS ITS NEW, FUEL-EFFICIENT JETS ARE SAFE, BUT SUPPORTED THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) DECISION TO GROUND THEM.     EUROPE AND CANADA SAID THEY WOULD INDEPENDENTLY CERTIFY THE SAFETY OF THE JETS, FURTHER COMPLICATING PLANS TO GET THE AIRCRAFT BACK FLYING.     BOEING WILL MANDATE ON MAX JETS A PREVIOUSLY OPTIONAL COCKPIT WARNING LIGHT, WHICH MIGHT HAVE WARNED OF PROBLEMS THAT POSSIBLY PLAYED A ROLE IN THE ETHIOPIAN AND INDONESIAN CRASHES, SOURCES SAID ON MARCH 21.     INDONESIA\u2019S FLAG CARRIER GARUDA SAID ON MARCH 22 IT HAD SENT A LETTER TO BOEING ASKING TO CANCEL AN ORDER FOR 49 MAX 8 AIRCRAFT, BECOMING THE FIRST AIRLINE TO CONFIRM PLANS TO CANCEL AN ORDER AFTER THE CRASHES.     INVESTIGATORS HAVE FOUND SIMILARITIES IN THE \u2018ANGLE OF ATTACK\u2019 DATA FROM BOTH FLIGHTS. A PIECE OF A STABILIZER IN THE WRECKAGE OF THE ETHIOPIAN JET WITH THE TRIM SET IN AN UNUSUAL POSITION WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE LION AIR PLANE, SOURCES SAID.     EXPERTS BELIEVE A NEW FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM, MCAS, ON THE JETS, DESIGNED TO STOP STALLING BY DIPPING THE NOSE, MAY HAVE BEEN A FACTOR IN BOTH CRASHES, WITH PILOTS UNABLE TO OVERRIDE IT AS THEIR JETS PLUNGED AFTER A FAULTY SENSOR INDICATED A STALL. BUT NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE YET LINKS THE TWO ACCIDENTS.     THE MCAS SYSTEM ON THE ETHIOPIAN FLIGHT RE-ENGAGED AS MANY AS FOUR TIMES AFTER THE CREW INITIALLY TURNED IT OFF, TWO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER TOLD REUTERS ON APRIL 3.     THE WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTED ON APRIL 3 THAT THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES PILOTS HAD INITIALLY FOLLOWED BOEING\u2019S EMERGENCY PROCEDURES BUT LATER DEVIATED FROM THEM AS THEY TRIED TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE PLANE.     BOEING\u2019S COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DIVISION HAS BROUGHT IN A NEW VICE PRESIDENT OF ENGINEERING WHILE DEDICATING ANOTHER TOP EXECUTIVE TO THE AIRCRAFT INVESTIGATIONS, A COMPANY EMAIL SHOWED.  WHAT\u2019S NEXT?     ETHIOPIA IS DUE TO PUBLISH THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF AN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION WITHIN DAYS.     INDONESIA HAS ADVANCED THE PLANNED RELEASE OF ITS REPORT ON THE LION AIR CRASH TO BETWEEN JULY AND AUGUST, VERSUS A PREVIOUS SCHEDULE OF BETWEEN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER.     U.S. LAWMAKERS SAID THE 737 MAX COULD BE GROUNDED FOR WEEKS TO UPGRADE SOFTWARE IN EVERY PLANE. OTHER COUNTRIES MAY GROUND THE PLANES EVEN LONGER.     THE U.S. TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT\u2019S INSPECTOR GENERAL PLANS TO AUDIT THE FAA\u2019S CERTIFICATION OF THE JET, AN OFFICIAL WITH THE OFFICE SAID ON MARCH 19. THE OFFICE CAN RECOMMEND CHANGES OR IMPROVEMENTS TO HOW THE FAA OPERATES.     THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO LOOKING AT THE FAA\u2019S OVERSIGHT OF BOEING, A PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER HAS SAID. THE FAA HAS SAID IT IS \u201cABSOLUTELY\u201d CONFIDENT IN ITS VETTING.

REUTERS/TIKSA NEGERI/FILE PHOTO  INVESTIGATORS LOOKING TO UNCOVER THE CAUSES MUST ANSWER ONE OF THE BIGGEST QUESTIONS: WAS THE PLANE\u2019S SOFTWARE TO BLAME?  WHAT WE KNOW  - BOEING HAS STOPPED DELIVERY OF ALL NEW MAX JETS. ITS STOCK HAS FALLEN ABOUT 6 PERCENT SINCE THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH ON MARCH 10.  - BOEING MAINTAINS ITS NEW, FUEL-EFFICIENT JETS ARE SAFE, BUT SUPPORTED THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA) DECISION TO GROUND THEM.  - THE PRELIMINARY REPORT INTO THE ETHIOPIAN DISASTER, PUBLISHED ON APRIL 4, SHOWED A KEY SENSOR WAS WRECKED, POSSIBLY BY A BIRD STRIKE. IT BEGAN TO FEED FAULTY DATA INTO THE MANEUVERING CHARACTERISTICS AUGMENTATION SYSTEM (MCAS), DESIGNED TO PREVENT STALLS BY PUSHING THE NOSE OF THE PLANE LOWER.  - FLYING FASTER THAN RECOMMENDED, THE CREW STRUGGLED WITH MCAS AND TURNED IT OFF. BUT THE PLANE WAS STILL POINTED DOWN - MAKING IT HARD TO USE MANUAL CONTROLS. DATA SUGGESTS THEY LATER TURNED MCAS-RELATED SYSTEMS BACK ON - THAT WOULD ALSO REACTIVATE THE ELECTRIC TRIM SYSTEM TO HELP PUSH THE PLANE HIGHER. BUT WITH ITS POWER RESTORED, A FINAL MCAS NOSE-DOWN COMMAND KICKED IN. REACTIVATING MCAS IS CONTRARY TO ADVICE ISSUED BY BOEING AND REGULATORS. THE REPORT DID NOT ADDRESS THAT. [NL8N21M5G9  - THE PRELIMINARY REPORT INTO OCTOBER\u2019S LION AIR CRASH IN INDONESIA SUGGESTED PILOTS ALSO LOST CONTROL AFTER GRAPPLING WITH THE MCAS SOFTWARE. IT ALSO FOCUSED ON AIRLINE MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING.  - SOURCES SAID ON MARCH 21 THAT BOEING WOULD MANDATE ON MAX JETS A PREVIOUSLY OPTIONAL COCKPIT WARNING LIGHT, WHICH MIGHT HAVE WARNED OF PROBLEMS THAT POSSIBLY PLAYED A ROLE IN BOTH CRASHES.  - BOEING SAID ON APRIL 3 IT HAD SUCCESSFULLY TESTED AN UPDATE OF THE MCAS SYSTEM.  - THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION SAID ON APRIL 3 IT WAS LAUNCHING A NEW REVIEW OF THE 737 MAX.  - EUROPE AND CANADA SAID ON MARCH 20 THEY WOULD INDEPENDENTLY CERTIFY THE SAFETY OF THE JETS, FURTHER COMPLICATING PLANS TO GET THE AIRCRAFT BACK FLYING.  - INDONESIA\u2019S FLAG CARRIER GARUDA SAID ON MARCH 22 IT HAD SENT A LETTER TO BOEING ASKING TO CANCEL AN ORDER FOR 49 MAX 8 AIRCRAFT, BECOMING THE FIRST AIRLINE TO CONFIRM PLANS TO CANCEL AN ORDER AFTER THE CRASHES.  WHAT\u2019S NEXT?  - A FINAL REPORT BY ETHIOPIAN AUTHORITIES AIDED BY AIR-SAFETY EXPERTS FROM THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE IS DUE TO BE PUBLISHED WITHIN A YEAR.  - INDONESIA HAS ADVANCED THE PLANNED RELEASE OF ITS REPORT ON THE LION AIR CRASH TO BETWEEN JULY AND AUGUST, VERSUS A PREVIOUS SCHEDULE OF BETWEEN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER.  - U.S. LAWMAKERS SAID ON MARCH 14 THE 737 MAX COULD BE GROUNDED FOR WEEKS TO UPGRADE SOFTWARE IN EVERY PLANE. OTHER COUNTRIES MAY GROUND THE PLANES EVEN LONGER.  - THE U.S. TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT\u2019S INSPECTOR GENERAL PLANS TO AUDIT THE FAA\u2019S CERTIFICATION OF THE JET, AN OFFICIAL WITH THE OFFICE SAID ON MARCH 19. THE OFFICE CAN RECOMMEND CHANGES OR IMPROVEMENTS TO HOW THE FAA OPERATES.  - THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO LOOKING AT THE FAA\u2019S OVERSIGHT OF BOEING, A PERSON FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER HAS SAID.

THE NO. 1 U.S. CARRIER OWNS 24 OF THE BRAND-NEW BOEING CO AIRCRAFT WHOSE USE WAS SUSPENDED AROUND THE WORLD IN MARCH.  THE MAX GROUNDING CAUSED 1,200 AMERICAN FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER, IN ADDITION TO 940 CANCELLATIONS DUE TO AMERICAN\u2019S DECISION TO REMOVE 14 737-800 AIRCRAFT FROM SERVICE AFTER PILOTS COMPLAINED THAT OVERHEAD BINS WERE NOT CLOSING ON SOME RECENTLY RETROFITTED CABINS.  AS A RESULT, AMERICAN SAID IT NOW EXPECTS HERE REVENUE PER AVAILABLE SEAT MILE, A CLOSELY FOLLOWED MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE, TO BE FLAT TO UP 1 PERCENT COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR FORECAST OF FLAT TO 2 PERCENT GROWTH.  AMERICAN SAID ALL ITS 737-800 AIRCRAFT WILL BE BACK IN SERVICE BY THE END OF APRIL, BUT THE CARRIER WILL CONTINUE TO CANCEL ABOUT 90 FLIGHTS PER DAY THROUGH JUNE 5 AS THE 737 MAX REMAINS GROUNDED.  BECAUSE IT IS STILL UNCLEAR WHEN THE MAX JETS WILL BEGIN FLYING AGAIN, AMERICAN SAID IT CANNOT YET FORECAST THE COST OF THE DISRUPTION BEYOND THE FIRST QUARTER.  AMERICAN HAS 76 MORE MAX JETS ON ORDER, THOUGH DELIVERIES ARE ON HOLD AS BOEING WORKS THROUGH A SOFTWARE FIX, WHICH WILL NEED REGULATORY APPROVAL.  SHARES IN AMERICAN, WHICH HAVE RISEN ABOUT 5.5 PERCENT SO FAR THIS YEAR, WERE DOWN 2.1 PERCENT AT $33.175 IN MIDDAY TRADING, OFF A SESSION LOW OF $32.60.

ACCORDING TO THE REPORT BY THE ETHIOPIAN INVESTIGATORS, AN ALARM INDICATING EXCESS SPEED WAS HEARD ON THE COCKPIT VOICE REPORTER AS THE JET REACHED 500 KNOTS (575 MILES PER HOUR) - WELL ABOVE OPERATIONAL LIMITS.  FRAGMENTS IN A CRATER  THE PLANE HAD FAULTY \u201cANGLE OF ATTACK\u201d SENSOR READINGS, ITS NOSE WAS PUSHED DOWN AUTOMATICALLY, AND THE CREW LOST CONTROL DESPITE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDED INSTRUCTIONS, IT SAID.  \u201cMOST OF THE WRECKAGE WAS FOUND BURIED IN THE GROUND,\u201d THE REPORT SAID, INDICATING THE STRENGTH OF THE IMPACT ON AN ARID FIELD IN AN AGRICULTURAL ZONE. NO BODIES WERE RECOVERED, ONLY CHARRED FRAGMENTS AMONG THE DEBRIS IN A CRATER.  BOEING HAS SEEN BILLIONS WIPED OFF ITS MARKET VALUE SINCE THE CRASH, BUT ITS SHARES ACTUALLY ROSE 2.4 PERCENT ON THURSDAY. MORGAN STANLEY SAID THE REPORT OF FLIGHT CONTROL PROBLEMS, WHICH BOEING WAS ALREADY TRYING TO FIX, MEANT A \u201cWORST CASE SCENARIO\u201d OF A NEW CAUSE WAS PROBABLY OFF THE TABLE.  FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS, REGULATORS AND TRAVELERS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEEN WAITING TO FIND OUT TO WHAT EXTENT BOEING TECHNOLOGY OR THE PILOTS\u2019 ACTIONS PLAYED A ROLE.  A FINAL REPORT IS DUE WITHIN A YEAR.  THE PRELIMINARY REPORT INTO THE LION AIR DISASTER IN INDONESIA SUGGESTED PILOTS ALSO LOST CONTROL AFTER GRAPPLING WITH SO-CALLED MCAS SOFTWARE, A NEW AUTOMATED ANTI-STALL FEATURE THAT REPEATEDLY LOWERED THE NOSE BASED ON FAULTY SENSOR DATA.  \u201cIT HAD TO TAKE A SECOND DISASTER TO WAKE UP THE MAJOR PLAYERS TO PAY ATTENTION TO SOMETHING THAT COULD\u2019VE BEEN RESOLVED AFTER THE FIRST DISASTER,\u201d SAID ONE WOMAN, WHO LOST HER FATHER IN THE ETHIOPIAN CRASH, ASKING NOT TO BE NAMED.  \u201cWHATEVER THE ISSUES WERE, THEY BETTER BE 110 PERCENT SURE ABOUT THEIR RESOLUTION, OTHERWISE THE 157 LIVES LOST WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR NOTHING IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS AGAIN. THIS IS A LESSON TO NOT TAKE SHORTCUTS IN ORDER TO TRY AND SAVE BUCKS.\u201d  \u201cPROFITS OVER SAFETY\u201d?  U.S. REGULATOR THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, UNDER FIRE FOR ITS CERTIFICATION OF THE MAX, CAUTIONED THE INQUIRY WAS NOT OVER. \u201cAS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ACCIDENT AND FINDINGS BECOME AVAILABLE, WE WILL TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION,\u201d IT SAID.  BOEING MAY PRESS TO KNOW HOW CREW MEMBERS RESPONDED TO PROBLEMS TRIGGERED BY THE FAULTY DATA. QUESTIONS ON WHETHER THE PILOTS HAD LEVELED OUT THE PLANE BEFORE DISENGAGING MCAS AND HOW MANY TIMES MCAS ACTIVATED WERE NOT ANSWERED AT THE NEWS CONFERENCE IN ADDIS ABABA THAT LASTED ABOUT 40 MINUTES.  THE NEW YORK TIMES QUOTED DAGMAWIT AS SAYING PILOTS TURNED MCAS OFF AND ON, WHICH IS NOT THE STEP RECOMMENDED IN PUBLISHED BOEING PROCEDURES TELLING CREW TO LEAVE IT OFF ONCE DISABLED.  WITH BEREAVED FAMILIES ANGRY AND CONFUSED, RELATIVES OF ONE WOMAN KILLED IN THE ETHIOPIAN CRASH FILED THE FIRST LAWSUIT ON BEHALF OF A U.S. VICTIM IN CHICAGO.  THE COMPLAINT ACCUSED BOEING OF PUTTING \u201cPROFITS OVER SAFETY\u201d AND ALSO TARGETED ROSEMOUNT AEROSPACE, THE MANUFACTURER OF THE ANGLE OF ATTACK SENSOR.  U.S. CONSUMER ACTIVIST RALPH NADER, WHOSE GRAND-NIECE DIED IN ETHIOPIA, CALLED FOR CONSUMERS TO BOYCOTT THE MAX.  RELATED COVERAGE EXPLAINER: ETHIOPIA CRASH RAISES QUESTIONS OVER HANDLING OF FAULTS ON BOEING 737 MAX  PILOTS AROUND THE WORLD WERE WATCHING CLOSELY TOO.  \u201cIF THE PRELIMINARY REPORT FROM THE ETHIOPIAN AUTHORITIES IS ACCURATE, THE PILOTS QUICKLY IDENTIFIED THE MALFUNCTION AND APPLIED THE MANUFACTURER\u2019S CHECKLIST,\u201d SAID CAPTAIN JASON GOLDBERG, SPOKESMAN FOR ALLIED PILOTS ASSOCIATION, WHICH REPRESENTS AMERICAN AIRLINES PILOTS.  \u201cFOLLOWING THIS CHECKLIST DID NOT APPEAR TO ALLOW THE PILOTS TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT.\u201d", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2019-04-11T00:00:00", "key": "20190411BA", "labelr0": 1.4303721159642755, "labelr1": 2.5610546790576936, "labelr2": -1.1010430934569608, "labelr3": 1.66728812656476, "labelr4": -1.1002829298962709, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.586, "compound": -0.8176, "0_day_return": 1.4303721159642846, "1_day_return": 1.4303721159642846, "2_day_return": 1.4318132699373098, "3_day_return": 3.1229738491463044, "4_day_return": 1.9883293710827528, "label": 1, "return": 0.006609324295980375, "excess_return": 1.4237627916683042, "count_of_word": 898, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5388566999999999, "prof1": 0.46114329, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5178101882247075, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4821898117752925, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5388566999999999, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.46114329, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.5327437, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.46725625, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.534725, "tr_prof1": 0.46527496, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.35433143, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.64566857, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5803375, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.41966245, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.38461587, "headline_prof21": 0.6153841, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.37760186, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.6223982, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.32309029, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.67690974, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.8561319, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.14386812, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -1.4303721159642846, "returnpredvader": -1.4303721159642846, "returnpredsgd": -1.4303721159642846, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9856962788403572, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9856962788403572, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9856962788403572, "cumreturn1b": 1.1712246692925858, "cumreturn1d": 1.0682706615479862, "cumreturn1e": 1.151947545778834, "cumreturndow": 1.1482933954790835, "cumreturnsp500": 1.127133540895346}, {"Unnamed: 0": 5024, "Unnamed: 0.1": 5024, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 5024, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 5024, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 5024, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 5024, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 5024, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 5024, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 5024, "level_0": 5024, "index": 5024, "text": "WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - BOEING CO HAS BEEN AWARDED A $14.3 BILLION CONTRACT FOR THE MODIFICATION, MODERNIZATION, ENGINEERING AND TESTING OF WEAPONS SYSTEMS FOR THE B-1 AND B-52 BOMBERS, THE PENTAGON SAID ON FRIDAY.

UNITED HAS ANOTHER 16 MAX ORDERS SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY THIS YEAR.  \u201cTHE AIRCRAFT SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY THIS YEAR, WE WOULD EXPECT TO TAKE THIS YEAR,\u201d CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER GERALD LADERMAN SAID ON A FIRST-QUARTER CONFERENCE CALL.  UNITED POSTED A BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED JUMP IN FIRST-QUARTER PROFIT LATE ON TUESDAY AFTER SELLING MORE TICKETS AND CUTTING COSTS, AND STOOD BY ITS 2019 PROFIT TARGET DESPITE THE 737 MAX GROUNDING. ITS SHARES WERE UP 4.0 PERCENT AT $88.62 ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.  UNLIKE OTHER U.S. AIRLINES THAT OWN THE MAX, NO. 3 UNITED HAS LARGELY AVOIDED FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS AFTER THE GROUNDING, DEFERRING NONESSENTIAL MAINTENANCE ON LARGER AIRCRAFT TO PUT THEM ON MAX ROUTES.  BUT EXECUTIVES SAID ON WEDNESDAY THAT THE STRATEGY, MANAGEABLE FOR A MONTH OR TWO, GETS TOUGHER AS TIME GOES ON.  UNITED HAS BEEN EXPANDING ITS AVAILABLE SEAT CAPACITY AT A FASTER PACE THAN RIVALS BUT SAID ON TUESDAY IT WAS TRIMMING THAT 2019 TARGET TO REFLECT THE GROUNDED MAX AS WELL AS SUSPENDED FLIGHTS TO DELHI DUE TO CLOSED AIR SPACE OVER PAKISTAN.  LADERMAN SAID THE CARRIER\u2019S COSTS PER SEAT MILE COULD GROW THIS YEAR IF THE MAX AIRCRAFT REMAIN OUT OF SERVICE OR FLIGHTS TO DELHI REMAIN SUSPENDED LONGER THAN ITS CURRENT ASSUMPTION.  LOOKING FORWARD, HE SAID UNITED WOULD DISCUSS WITH BOEING COMPENSATION OVER COSTS INCURRED DUE TO THE MAX GROUNDING, NOTING THE TEMPORARY GROUNDING OF BOEING\u2019S 787 SOON AFTER IT ENTERED SERVICE IN 2013 AS A \u201cHISTORICAL REFERENCE.\u201d  OF THE U.S. MAX OWNERS, UNITED WAS THE FIRST TO REPORT FIRST-QUARTER RESULTS.

HOWEVER, BOEING HAS NOT YET SUBMITTED ITS COMPLETED SOFTWARE PACKAGE TO THE FAA FOR APPROVAL, TWO OTHER SOURCES SAID.  NONE OF THE SOURCES, WHO WERE NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPEAK PUBLICLY, SAID THEY KNEW FOR SURE HOW LONG THE RE-CERTIFICATION PROCESS WILL TAKE.  A BOEING SPOKESWOMAN SAID THE COMPANY IS FOCUSED ON THE SAFE RETURN TO SERVICE OF THE MAX AND ITS ENGAGEMENT WITH GLOBAL REGULATORS AND CUSTOMERS.  BOEING CHIEF EXECUTIVE DENNIS MUILENBURG SAID LAST WEEK THE COMPANY HAD MADE THE FINAL TEST FLIGHT WITH THE NEW MAX SOFTWARE BEFORE A FINAL CERTIFICATION FLIGHT, INDICATING THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVED IT WAS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD REGULATORY APPROVAL.  ON APRIL 1, THE FAA SAID THAT ONCE IT RECEIVED BOEING\u2019S COMPLETED SOFTWARE PACKAGE IT WOULD RUN A RIGOROUS SAFETY REVIEW BEFORE APPROVING THE SOFTWARE FOR INSTALLATION.

SAFRAN SAID ITS CFM INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURE WITH GENERAL ELECTRIC CONTINUES TO DELIVER LEAP ENGINES TO BOEING AS IT CATCHES UP ON EARLIER ENGINE PRODUCTION DELAYS, BUT WOULD ADAPT ITS OUTPUT AS NECESSARY.  THE DISCLOSURE SUGGESTS SAFRAN IS NOT YET FACING A BUILD-UP IN INVENTORY OF ENGINES FOR NARROW-BODY AIRCRAFT, ALLAYING CONCERNS AMONG SOME ANALYSTS ABOUT A COSTLY DRAIN ON ITS CASH.  SAFRAN SHARES ROSE MORE THAN 2 PERCENT AFTER IT POSTED QUARTERLY UNDERLYING REVENUE UP 12.6 PERCENT, OUTSTRIPPING THE PACE SET BY A 2019 LIKE-FOR-LIKE GROWTH TARGET OF 5 PERCENT.  CFM PRODUCES ENGINES FOR THE BOEING 737 AND COMPETES WITH PRATT & WHITNEY TO SELL ENGINES FOR THE AIRBUS A320NEO.  BOEING HALTED DELIVERIES OF THE 737 MAX IN MARCH AFTER REGULATORS GROUNDED THE PLANE IN THE WAKE OF TWO FATAL ACCIDENTS. IT CONTINUES TO PRODUCE THE PLANE BUT AT A SLOWER RATE OF 42 AIRPLANES PER MONTH INSTEAD OF 52. STARTING AND STOPPING AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION LINES IS EXPENSIVE.  CFM HAS SO FAR KEPT ENGINE PRODUCTION AT A RATE CONSISTENT WITH BOEING\u2019S PREVIOUS OUTPUT OF 52 JETS A MONTH BECAUSE THE EXTRA ENGINES ARE BEING DIVERTED TO EQUIP PLANES THAT HAD BEEN LEFT WITHOUT ENGINES AT THE BOEING PLANT DUE TO EARLIER DELAYS.  SAFRAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE PHILPPE PETITCOLIN SAID HE EXPECTED THIS \u201cRECOVERY PROCESS\u201d TO BE COMPLETED IN MAY.  HE DID NOT SAY HOW CFM WOULD RESPOND AFTER THAT, BUT INDUSTRY SOURCES SAY FEW DECISIONS ARE EXPECTED UNTIL BOEING HAS AT LEAST A THEORETICAL TIMETABLE FOR THE UNGROUNDING OF THE PLANE.  FINANCE DIRECTOR BERNARD DELPIT SAID SAFRAN WAS SEEING A \u201cSLIGHT CASH IMPACT\u201d FROM BOEING\u2019S DELIVERY FREEZE BECAUSE IT GETS PAID A PORTION OF ITS ENGINE REVENUE FROM BOEING WHEN THE AIRCRAFT IS DELIVERED.  BUT HE SAID THIS WAS BEING OFFSET BY STRONG CASHFLOW IN THE REST OF THE GROUP.  FIRST-QUARTER SALES INCLUDED LIKE-FOR-LIKE GROWTH OF 13.3 PERCENT IN AEROSYSTEMS AND AIRCRAFT INTERIORS, WHICH INCLUDES ACTIVITIES ACQUIRED THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF ZODIAC AEROSPACE LAST YEAR. THESE COUNT IN SAFRAN\u2019S EARNINGS FROM MARCH 2018.  SAFRAN WARNED THIS RATE OF GROWTH WAS \u201cNOT FULLY REPRESENTATIVE\u201d OF THE ANNUAL TREND, EVEN THOUGH ITS \u2018SEATS\u2019 DIVISION RESUMED LIKE-FOR-LIKE GROWTH IN THE FIRST QUARTER.  THE CIVIL AFTERMARKET GREW 10.2 PERCENT IN DOLLAR TERMS IN THE FIRST QUARTER, SAFRAN SAID.

THE COMMENTS WERE MADE BY THE ALLIED PILOTS ASSOCIATION (APA), WHICH REPRESENTS PILOTS AT AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC , THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST AIRLINE AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST 737 MAX OPERATORS IN THE UNITED STATES.  THEIR SUPPORT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE BOEING HAS SAID PILOTS\u2019 CONFIDENCE IN THE 737 MAX WILL PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN CONVINCING THE PUBLIC THAT THE AIRCRAFT IS SAFE TO FLY AGAIN.  BOEING\u2019S FAST-SELLING 737 MAX WAS GROUNDED WORLDWIDE IN MARCH FOLLOWING A FATAL ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH THAT KILLED ALL 157 ON BOARD JUST FIVE MONTHS AFTER A SIMILAR CRASH ON A LION AIR FLIGHT THAT KILLED ALL 189 PASSENGERS AND CREW.  NOW IT IS READYING FOR REGULATORY APPROVAL A FINAL SOFTWARE UPDATE AND TRAINING PACKAGE TO ADDRESS AN ANTI-STALL SYSTEM KNOWN AS MCAS THAT PLAYED A ROLE IN BOTH NOSE-DOWN CRASHES.  A DRAFT REPORT BY AN FAA-APPOINTED BOARD OF PILOTS, ENGINEERS AND OTHER EXPERTS CONCLUDED THAT PILOTS ONLY NEED ADDITIONAL COMPUTER-BASED TRAINING TO UNDERSTAND MCAS, RATHER THAN SIMULATOR TIME. THE PUBLIC HAS UNTIL APRIL 30 TO MAKE COMMENTS.  PROTESTERS ARE EXPECTED OUTSIDE BOEING\u2019S ANNUAL MEETING IN CHICAGO ON MONDAY, WHERE SHAREHOLDERS WILL ALSO QUESTION THE COMPANY OVER ITS SAFETY RECORD.  APA IS ARGUING THAT MERE COMPUTER EXPLANATION \u201cWILL NOT PROVIDE A LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE FOR PILOTS TO FEEL NOT ONLY COMFORTABLE FLYING THE AIRCRAFT BUT ALSO RELAYING THAT CONFIDENCE TO THE TRAVELING PUBLIC.\u201d  IT SAID THE MAX COMPUTER TRAINING, WHICH ORIGINALLY INVOLVED A ONE-HOUR IPAD COURSE, SHOULD INCLUDE VIDEOS OF SIMULATOR SESSIONS SHOWING HOW MCAS WORKS ALONG WITH DEMONSTRATIONS OF OTHER COCKPIT EMERGENCIES SUCH AS RUNAWAY STABILIZER, A LOSS OF CONTROL THAT OCCURRED ON BOTH DOOMED FLIGHTS.  APA ALSO CALLED FOR RECURRING TRAINING ON SIMULATORS THAT INCLUDES SCENARIOS LIKE THOSE EXPERIENCED BY THE LION AIR AND ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES PILOTS, IN ADDITION TO COMPUTER TRAINING.  \u201cWHEN PILOTS VISUALLY EXPERIENCE THE FAILURE MODES AND THEN APPLY THEM, THE LESSON IS CEMENTED IN THEIR MINDS,\u201d APA WROTE.  AMERICAN AIRLINES HAS SAID IT IS LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES IN COORDINATION WITH THE FAA AND ITS PILOTS UNION.  CANADA, EUROPE AND SOUTH KOREA ARE ALL WEIGHING THE NEED FOR SIMULATOR TRAINING, GOING ABOVE THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE DRAFT FAA REPORT, SOURCES HAVE SAID.  REQUIRED SIMULATOR TRAINING COULD DELAY THE MAX\u2019S RETURN TO SERVICE BECAUSE IT TAKES TIME TO SCHEDULE HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF PILOTS ON SIMULATORS.

BY BECOMING OPTIONAL, THE ALERT HAD BEEN TREATED IN THE SAME WAY AS A SEPARATE INDICATOR SHOWING RAW AOA DATA, WHICH IS SELDOM USED BY COMMERCIAL PILOTS AND HAD BEEN AN ADD-ON FOR YEARS.  \u201cNEITHER THE ANGLE OF ATTACK INDICATOR NOR THE AOA DISAGREE ALERT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE SAFE OPERATION OF THE AIRPLANE,\u201d BOEING SAID.  \u201cTHEY PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ONLY, AND HAVE NEVER BEEN CONSIDERED SAFETY FEATURES ON COMMERCIAL JET TRANSPORT AIRPLANES.\u201d  BOEING SAID A SAFETY REVIEW BOARD CONVENED AFTER A FATAL LION AIR CRASH IN INDONESIA LAST OCTOBER CORROBORATED ITS PRIOR CONCLUSION THAT THE ALERT WAS NOT NECESSARY FOR THE SAFE OPERATION OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND COULD SAFELY BE TACKLED IN A FUTURE SYSTEM UPDATE.  THE FAA BACKED THAT ASSESSMENT BUT CRITICIZED BOEING FOR BEING SLOW TO DISCLOSE THE PROBLEM.  BOEING BRIEFED THE FAA ON THE DISPLAY ISSUE IN NOVEMBER, AFTER THE LION AIR ACCIDENT, AND A SPECIAL PANEL DEEMED IT TO BE \u201cLOW RISK,\u201d AN FAA SPOKESMAN SAID.  \u201cHOWEVER, BOEING\u2019S TIMELY OR EARLIER COMMUNICATION WITH THE OPERATORS WOULD HAVE HELPED TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE POSSIBLE CONFUSION,\u201d HE ADDED.  BOEING ATTRIBUTED THE ERROR TO SOFTWARE DELIVERED TO THE COMPANY FROM AN OUTSIDE SOURCE, BUT DID NOT GIVE DETAILS.  INDUSTRY DEBATE  SUNDAY\u2019S STATEMENT MARKED THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE TWO FATAL ACCIDENTS THAT BOEING EXPLICITLY ACKNOWLEDGED DOING SOMETHING INADVERTENTLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 737 MAX, ALBEIT ON AN ISSUE THAT IT CONTENDS HAS NO IMPACT ON SAFETY.  BOEING HAS SAID THE FEEDING OF ERRONEOUS ANGLE OF ATTACK DATA TO A SYSTEM CALLED MCAS THAT PUSHED THE PLANES LOWER WAS A COMMON LINK IN TWO WIDER CHAINS OF EVENTS LEADING TO BOTH CRASHES, BUT HAS STOPPED SHORT OF ADMITTING ERROR ON THAT FRONT.  THE ANGLE OF ATTACK MEASURES THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE AIR FLOW AND THE WING AND HELPS DETERMINE WHETHER THE PLANE IS ABLE TO FLY CORRECTLY. IF THE ANGLE BECOMES TOO STEEP, THE FLOW OF AIR OVER THE WING IS DISTURBED, THROWING THE PLANE INTO AN AERODYNAMIC STALL. THAT MEANS IT STARTS TO FALL INSTEAD OF FLY.  ALTHOUGH THE ANGLE ITSELF IS KEY FOR ONBOARD SYSTEMS, THE INDUSTRY HAS DEBATED FOR YEARS WHETHER SUCH DATA SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN ALREADY CROWDED COCKPIT DISPLAYS BECAUSE IT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO AIRSPEED, WHICH PILOTS ALREADY SCRUTINIZE.  SOME ANALYSTS AND ACADEMICS SAY HAVING THE AOA DISAGREE ALERT INSTALLED WOULD HAVE HELPED LION AIR MAINTENANCE CREW DIAGNOSE A PROBLEM ON THE PENULTIMATE FLIGHT OF THE 737 MAX JET THAT CRASHED IN OCTOBER, KILLING ALL 189 ON BOARD.  THE 737 MAX WAS GROUNDED WORLDWIDE OVER SAFETY CONCERNS FOLLOWING THE ETHIOPIAN CRASH IN MARCH, KILLING 157 PEOPLE.  WHEN THE JET RETURNS TO SERVICE, ALL NEW AIRCRAFT WILL HAVE A WORKING AOA DISAGREE ALERT AS A STANDARD FEATURE AND A NO-CHARGE OPTIONAL INDICATOR SHOWING THE UNDERLYING DATA, BOEING SAID. THAT RESTORES THE SITUATION FOUND ON THE DISPLAYS OF PREVIOUS 737NG MODELS SINCE AROUND THE MIDDLE OF LAST DECADE.  AIRLINES WITH GROUNDED 737 MAX JETS WILL BE ABLE TO ACTIVATE THE AOA DISAGREE FUNCTION DIRECTLY.  BOEING IS ALSO DEVELOPING A SOFTWARE UPGRADE AND TRAINING CHANGES TO THE MCAS SYSTEM THAT MUST BE APPROVED BY GLOBAL REGULATORS BEFORE THE JETS CAN FLY AGAIN.  BOEING HAS YET TO FORMALLY SUBMIT THE UPGRADES TO THE FAA FOR APPROVAL BUT COULD DO AS EARLY AS THIS WEEK ONCE IT COMPLETES A SPECIAL TEST FLIGHT.  FEDERAL PROSECUTORS, THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT INSPECTOR GENERAL\u2019S OFFICE AND A BLUE-RIBBON PANEL ARE ALSO LOOKING INTO THE 737 MAX\u2019S CERTIFICATION.

REUTERS/KEVIN LAMARQUE  SHANAHAN HAD BEEN UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE PENTAGON INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR ALLEGEDLY SEEKING PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT OF BOEING WHILE AT THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT BUT HE WAS CLEARED OF WRONGDOING IN APRIL. HE HAS BEEN ACTING DEFENSE SECRETARY SINCE JANUARY, THE LONGEST IN PENTAGON HISTORY.  \u201cBASED UPON HIS OUTSTANDING SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY AND HIS DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO LEAD, PRESIDENT TRUMP INTENDS TO NOMINATE PATRICK M. SHANAHAN TO BE THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE,\u201d WHITE HOUSE SPOKESWOMAN SARAH SANDERS SAID IN A STATEMENT.  EARLY TESTS FOR SHANAHAN WILL INCLUDE HANDLING GROWING TENSIONS WITH IRAN, RENEWED MISSILE TESTS BY NORTH KOREA AND QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HANDLE THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS IN VENEZUELA.  SHANAHAN SAID IN A STATEMENT THAT HE WAS COMMITTED TO MODERNIZING U.S. MILITARY FORCES AND IF CONFIRMED WOULD AGGRESSIVELY IMPLEMENT TRUMP\u2019S NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY WHICH PRIORITIZES COMPETITION WITH CHINA AND RUSSIA OVER THE COUNTERINSURGENCY WARS THAT HAVE CONSUMED THE PENTAGON FOR MUCH OF THE PAST TWO DECADES.  SHANAHAN, 56, WAS THRUST INTO THE ROLE IN AN ACTING CAPACITY IN JANUARY, AFTER JIM MATTIS ABRUPTLY RESIGNED OVER POLICY DIFFERENCES WITH TRUMP.  ON HIS FIRST DAY AS ACTING PENTAGON CHIEF IN JANUARY, SHANAHAN TOLD CIVILIAN LEADERS OF THE U.S. MILITARY TO FOCUS ON \u201cCHINA, CHINA, CHINA.\u201d  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO WITHDRAW MOST U.S. TROOPS FROM SYRIA AND DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO BRING AN END TO THE 17-YEAR-OLD WAR AFGHANISTAN.  BUT THE MOST PRESSING SHORT-TERM ISSUE IS LIKELY TO BE IRAN. EARLIER THIS WEEK THE PENTAGON SAID IT WAS SENDING A CARRIER STRIKE GROUP AND BOMBERS TO THE MIDDLE EAST AFTER U.S. INTELLIGENCE SIGNALED POSSIBLE PREPARATIONS BY TEHRAN TO STAGE ATTACKS AGAINST U.S. FORCES OR INTERESTS.  SHANAHAN IS EXPECTED TO BE CONFIRMED BY SENATORS, THOUGH HE COULD FACE A TOUGH CONFIRMATION PROCESS BECAUSE OF HIS TENURE AT BOEING.  LAWMAKERS HAVE PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT UNDUE INFLUENCE ON THE PENTAGON FROM DEFENSE COMPANIES.  TIES BETWEEN BOEING AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION RUN DEEP, WITH TRUMP USING THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS AND SITES AS A BACKDROP FOR MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS.  BOEING, THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST PLANEMAKER, IS FACING ONE OF THE BIGGEST CRISES IN ITS 103-YEAR HISTORY FOLLOWING THE DISASTERS ON LION AIR IN INDONESIA LAST YEAR AND ANOTHER ON ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES IN MARCH, WHICH TOGETHER KILLED ALL 346 ON BOARD.  THE PENTAGON INSPECTOR GENERAL STARTED THE INVESTIGATION OF SHANAHAN IN MARCH FOR ALLEGEDLY PROMOTING BOEING IN PENTAGON MEETINGS AND DISPARAGING COMPETITORS. BUT A REPORT PUBLISHED ON APRIL 25 SAID NONE OF THE ALLEGATIONS WERE SUBSTANTIATED.  DEFENSE SECRETARIES HAVE TRADITIONALLY COME FROM A POLITICAL OR POLICY BACKGROUND, SERVING AS A COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE MILITARY BRASS IN DECISION MAKING. MATTIS, A RETIRED MARINE GENERAL, WAS ONE OF THE FEW FORMER MILITARY LEADERS TO BECOME SECRETARY.  MATTIS IMPLICITLY CRITICIZED TRUMP IN HIS RESIGNATION LETTER FOR FAILING TO VALUE ALLIES WHO FIGHT ALONGSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING IN PLACES LIKE SYRIA.  SHANAHAN IS UNLIKELY TO BE AN EFFECTIVE COUNTERWEIGHT TO TRUMP\u2019S OFTEN IMPULSIVE DECISION MAKING. HE TOURED THE U.S. BORDER WITH MEXICO IN FEBRUARY IN WHAT WAS SEEN AS A SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR TRUMP\u2019S PLANNED BORDER WALL.  BOEING TIES  SHANAHAN HAS BEEN SERVING IN AN ACTING CAPACITY SINCE THE START OF THE YEAR, MAKING HIM THE LONGEST ACTING DEFENSE SECRETARY EVER. HE JOINED BOEING IN 1986 AND SPENT MORE THAN THREE DECADES THERE, WORKING ON THE 737 AND 787 DREAMLINER COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES.  SHANAHAN WAS ALSO THE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL MANAGER OF BOEING MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS AND WORKED ON THE APACHE, CHINOOK AND OSPREY MILITARY AIRCRAFT.  TRUMP HIMSELF HAS BEEN A STRONG PROPONENT OF MILITARY PRODUCTS MADE BY U.S. DEFENSE COMPANIES. IN PHONE CALLS AND PUBLIC APPEARANCES WITH WORLD LEADERS, TRUMP HAS GONE FURTHER THAN ANY OF HIS PREDECESSORS TO ACT AS A SALESMAN FOR THE U.S. DEFENSE INDUSTRY.  A SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL, SPEAKING ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY, SAID SHANAHAN BELIEVED THAT HE WAS ANSWERABLE TO TRUMP AND IT WAS HIS JOB TO IMPLEMENT DECISIONS MADE BY THE PRESIDENT.  IN FEBRUARY, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, SENATOR JAMES INHOFE, SAID HE DID NOT THINK TRUMP WOULD NOMINATE SHANAHAN. BUT SINCE THEN, OFFICIALS SAY INHOFE HAS PRIVATELY TOLD SHANAHAN HE WOULD BACK HIM.  \u201cWE NEED A CONFIRMED LEADER AT THE DEPARTMENT AND, AFTER WORKING WITH HIM CLOSELY OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS, I WELCOME HIS SELECTION,\u201d INHOFE SAID IN A STATEMENT ON THURSDAY.  DURING SHANAHAN\u2019S SENATE CONFIRMATION HEARING TO BE DEPUTY DEFENSE SECRETARY IN 2017, THE COMMITTEE\u2019S THEN-CHAIRMAN, JOHN MCCAIN, VOICED DEEP CONCERN ABOUT GIVING THE DEPUTY JOB TO AN EXECUTIVE FROM ONE OF THE FIVE CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTING FOR THE LION\u2019S SHARE OF U.S. DEFENSE SPENDING.  \u201cI HAVE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE FOX IS NOT GOING TO BE PUT BACK INTO THE HENHOUSE,\u201d SAID MCCAIN, WHO DIED IN AUGUST.", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2019-05-09T00:00:00", "key": "20190509BA", "labelr0": -1.5621959694232117, "labelr1": 0.15248637506001195, "labelr2": -4.877773705134354, "labelr3": 1.6806473604647765, "labelr4": 0.7579291044776021, "pos": 0.17600000000000002, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.128, "0_day_return": -1.562195969423208, "1_day_return": 0.1524863750600014, "2_day_return": -4.7327252703809455, "3_day_return": -3.131618332250873, "4_day_return": -2.3974246745545487, "label": 1, "return": 0.0037202970362448227, "excess_return": 0.14876607802375658, "count_of_word": 866, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.46468425, "prof1": 0.5353157, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4938215115761696, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5061784884238304, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.46468425, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.5353157, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.53376144, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.4662386, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.46715936, "tr_prof1": 0.53284067, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.49204463, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.5079553, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5150302999999999, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.48496968, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.41959846, "headline_prof21": 0.5804015, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.3915714, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.6084286, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.44485274, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.55514723, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.76868397, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.23131606, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": 0.1524863750600014, "returnpredvader": 0.1524863750600014, "returnpredsgd": 0.1524863750600014, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0015248637506, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0015248637506, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0015248637506, "cumreturn1b": 1.096354169964884, "cumreturn1d": 1.0129991724381282, "cumreturn1e": 1.076980660292426, "cumreturndow": 1.1380206360116027, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1070794108987272}, {"Unnamed: 0": 6734, "Unnamed: 0.1": 6734, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 6734, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 6734, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 6734, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 6734, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6734, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6734, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6734, "level_0": 6734, "index": 6734, "text": "NEW YORK/CHICAGO (REUTERS) - U.S. FLIERS STILL CONSIDER TICKET PRICES THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR WHEN CHOOSING A FLIGHT, ACCORDING TO A REUTERS/IPSOS POLL, SUGGESTING TWO FATAL CRASHES OF BOEING CO 737 MAX JETS HAVE HAD LITTLE IMPACT ON CONSUMER SENTIMENT.  FILE PHOTO: A NUMBER OF GROUNDED SOUTHWEST AIRLINES BOEING 737 MAX 8 AIRCRAFTS ARE SHOWN PARKED AT VICTORVILLE AIRPORT IN VICTORVILLE, CALIFORNIA, U.S., MARCH 26, 2019. REUTERS/MIKE BLAKE/FILE PHOTO  IN THE PUBLIC OPINION POLL RELEASED MAY 15, ONLY ABOUT HALF OF U.S. ADULTS SAY THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE AIRPLANE CRASHES IN INDONESIA AND ETHIOPIA THAT TOGETHER KILLED 346 PEOPLE, AND ONLY 43% COULD IDENTIFY THE BOEING 737 MAX AS THE AIRCRAFT INVOLVED.  MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR BOEING IN THE WAKE OF THE CRASHES, ONLY 3% SAID THAT AIRCRAFT MAKER OR MODEL NUMBER WAS MOST IMPORTANT TO THEM WHEN BUYING A PLANE TICKET. IN CONTRAST, 57% SAID TICKET PRICE WAS MOST IMPORTANT. THE POLL HAS A CREDIBILITY INTERVAL, A MEASURE OF PRECISION, OF 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS.  TO SEE THE FULL RESULTS OF THE POLL, WHICH WAS CONDUCTED ONLINE IN ENGLISH THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND GATHERED RESPONSES FROM 2,008 ADULTS, CLICK HERE.  A BOEING SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE REUTERS/IPSOS POLL, BUT SAID THE COMPANY IS \u201cCOMMITTED TO RETURNING THE MAX SAFELY TO THE SKIES SO THAT PILOTS, CREW, REGULATORS AND THE TRAVELING PUBLIC HAVE TOTAL CONFIDENCE IN THIS AIRPLANE.\u201d  DURING A CALL WITH INVESTORS LAST MONTH, BOEING CEO DENNIS MUILENBURG SAID HE KNOWS \u201cWE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO TO EARN AND RE-EARN THE TRUST OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE FLYING PUBLIC IN PARTICULAR.\u201d  IF GLOBAL REGULATORS CLEAR THE JETS FOR FLIGHT, THE REUTERS/IPSOS POLL DATA SUGGEST THAT CARRIERS LIKELY WILL NOT HAVE TROUBLE BOOKING SEATS ON THE AIRCRAFT.  BOEING\u2019S FAST-SELLING 737 MAX AIRLINER WAS GROUNDED WORLDWIDE IN MARCH AFTER AN ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH, JUST FIVE MONTHS AFTER A SIMILAR DISASTER ON A LION AIR FLIGHT.  BOEING\u2019S STOCK HAS FALLEN ABOUT 18% SINCE THE MARCH 10 CRASH, AND AIRLINES HAVE WARNED THAT THE GROUNDINGS ARE HITTING REVENUES, AND COSTS, TO THE TUNE OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP URGED BOEING TO \u201cREBRAND\u201d THE 737 MAX WITH A NEW NAME IN A APRIL 15 TWEET, SAYING \u201cNO PRODUCT HAS SUFFERED LIKE THIS ONE.\u201d THAT SENTIMENT WAS ECHOED IN A RECENT BARCLAYS INVESTMENT BANK REPORT THAT CONCLUDED THAT \u201cA LARGE PORTION OF FLIERS ARE LIKELY TO AVOID 737 MAX FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD BEYOND WHEN THE GROUNDING IS LIFTED.\u201d  BARCLAYS SAID IT BASED ITS FINDINGS ON A SURVEY OF FLIERS IN NORTH AMERICAN AND EUROPE, THOUGH IT WOULD NOT DISCLOSE TO REUTERS THE SURVEY METHODOLOGY OR QUESTIONNAIRE. IT IS UNCLEAR HOW BARCLAYS SELECTED ITS RESPONDENTS AND HOW MUCH THEY WERE INFORMED OF THE BOEING CRASHES BEFORE BEING ASKED THEIR OPINION.  BOEING DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE BARCLAYS SURVEY.  THE CHICAGO-BASED MANUFACTURER IS THE TARGET OF INVESTIGATIONS AND LAWSUITS, AND IS IN REGULAR DISCUSSIONS WITH U.S. AIRLINES ON HOW TO REGAIN PUBLIC TRUST. HALF OF ALL U.S. ADULTS SAY THAT AIRLINES PRIORITIZE PROFITS OVER PASSENGER SAFETY, NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE RESULT IN THE APRIL 2018 POLL.  BUT BASED ON THE REUTERS/IPSOS POLL, EVEN IF PEOPLE WERE AWARE OF THE 737 MAX CRASHES, THAT KNOWLEDGE IS NOT LIKELY TO INFLUENCE THEIR TRAVEL DECISIONS. PEOPLE SAY THEY MOSTLY CONSIDER TICKET PRICE WHEN PLANNING UPCOMING PLANE TRIPS, FOLLOWED BY TRAVEL TIME, THE NUMBER OF STOPS AND THE CARRIER.  THAT DOES NOT MEAN ALL FLIERS IGNORE MODELS, ACCORDING TO STEVE HAFNER, CEO OF TRAVEL BOOKING WEBSITE KAYAK. HE SAID THE WEBSITE HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT USAGE OF A PLANE MODEL FILTER IT INTRODUCED AFTER THE ETHIOPIAN CRASH, SHOWING DEMAND FROM SOME TRAVELERS.  \u201cAS THE NEWS CYCLE ON THIS SIMMERS DOWN AND IT BECOMES LESS TOP OF MIND FOR TRAVELERS, WE\u2019VE SEEN FILTER USAGE GO FLAT. BUT THAT\u2019S NOT TO SAY IT WON\u2019T PICK BACK UP ONCE THE PLANES START FLYING AGAIN,\u201d HAFNER SAID.  SOUTHWEST STILL ON TOP  IN ANOTHER INDICATION OF THE LIMITED IMPACT OF THE 737 MAX CRASHES ON CONSUMER SENTIMENT, THE AIRLINE WITH THE DEEPEST CONNECTION TO THE BOEING NARROWBODY, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO, REMAINED THE MOST POPULAR CARRIER IN THE POLL.  SOUTHWEST, THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST 737 MAX OPERATOR WITH 34 JETS AND AT LEAST 249 MORE ON ORDER, IS CANCELLING 160 DAILY FLIGHTS DURING THE PEAK SUMMER TRAVEL SEASON AS A RESULT OF THE MAX GROUNDING, MORE THAN RIVAL U.S. CARRIERS.  STILL, 21% OF RESPONDENTS PICKED THE LOW-COST AIRLINE AS THEIR PREFERRED CARRIER, UP FROM 19% IN A SIMILAR REUTERS/IPSOS POLL THAT RAN IN JUNE 2017.  \u201cWE DON\u2019T BOOK THE PLANE, WE BOOK THE PLACE,\u201d SAID ALLEN FORREY, A 63-YEAR-OLD TRUCK DRIVER WHO DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE POLL, AFTER LANDING AT CHICAGO\u2019S MIDWAY AIRPORT FROM PHOENIX, ARIZONA ON SOUTHWEST.  OTHER FREQUENT SOUTHWEST CUSTOMERS AT MIDWAY TOLD REUTERS THEY CHOOSE THE AIRLINE BECAUSE OF ITS TWO FREE BAG POLICY, VERSUS FEES CHARGED BY COMPETITORS, AND FRIENDLY SERVICE.  SOUTHWEST SAID THE COMMENTS WERE CONSISTENT WITH FEEDBACK IT RECEIVES AND NOTED THAT \u201cWELL LESS THAN 1% OF CUSTOMERS CHECK THEIR AIRCRAFT TYPE TRADITIONALLY, BUT WE DO EXPECT MORE CUSTOMERS TO BECOME AWARE GIVEN THE CURRENT CLIMATE.\u201d  TO EASE ANY CONCERNS, SOUTHWEST SAID IT IS PROVIDING MAX UPDATES ON ITS WEBSITE AND COMMUNICATING WITH PASSENGERS ON A REGULAR BASIS.

REUTERS/MATT MILLS MCKNIGHT/FILE PHOTO  AFTER SOUTHWEST, 14% CHOSE DELTA AIR LINES, 11% AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC AND 8% UNITED AIRLINES. THIRTY-FIVE PERCENT SAID THEY DID NOT HAVE A PREFERRED AIRLINE, WHILE THE REST SELECTED AMONG JETBLUE AIRWAYS CORP, ALASKA AIRLINES, VIRGIN AMERICA OR ULTRA LOW-COST CARRIERS FRONTIER AIRLINES AND SPIRIT AIRLINES INC.  AS FOR THE MAX, EVEN IF PASSENGERS RANK PRICES AS THE TOP FACTOR WHEN BUYING PLANE TICKETS, U.S. PILOT AND FLIGHT ATTENDANT GROUPS ARE DEMANDING GUARANTEES FROM BOEING THAT THE AIRCRAFT IS 100% SAFE BEFORE THEY SUPPORT ITS RETURN TO SERVICE.  \u201cTHE LAST THING WE WANT IS OUR FLIGHT ATTENDANTS TO BE AFRAID TO FLY THAT PLANE,\u201d SAID LORI BASSANI, PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL FLIGHT ATTENDANTS.", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2019-05-15T00:00:00", "key": "20190515BA", "labelr0": 0.7579291044776021, "labelr1": 2.3637310496470363, "labelr2": 0.3419914643452643, "labelr3": -0.6281336262745651, "labelr4": 1.689390288840381, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.149, "compound": -0.4215, "0_day_return": 0.757929104477606, "1_day_return": 0.757929104477606, "2_day_return": 2.71380627242217, "3_day_return": 2.0686263163985696, "4_day_return": 3.7929637773405966, "label": 1, "return": 0.008895286972428994, "excess_return": 0.749033817505177, "count_of_word": 1030, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.60030025, "prof1": 0.39969978, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4846410721694861, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5153589278305141, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.60030025, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.39969978, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.27833202, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.721668, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5031417, "tr_prof1": 0.49685836, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5359271, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.46407288, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5725026, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.42749736, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.49914038, "headline_prof21": 0.5008596, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.47731307, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.52268696, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.5722788000000001, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.4277212, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.6670362, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.33296382, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -0.757929104477606, "returnpredvader": -0.757929104477606, "returnpredsgd": 0.757929104477606, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9960639669996487, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.011735097897405, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0155765631388975, "cumreturn1b": 1.0920388837718296, "cumreturn1d": 1.0248868168966798, "cumreturn1e": 1.0937563175468425, "cumreturndow": 1.136014334867669, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1036786978719957}, {"Unnamed: 0": 6779, "Unnamed: 0.1": 6779, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 6779, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 6779, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 6779, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 6779, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6779, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6779, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6779, "level_0": 6779, "index": 6779, "text": "HAVANA (REUTERS) - AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CRASH A YEAR AGO IN HAVANA OF A BOEING 737 JET THAT KILLED ALL BUT ONE OF THE 113 PEOPLE ABOARD SUGGESTS THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE WAS ERRORS BY THE CREW WHO DIED IN THE CRASH, CUBA SAID ON THURSDAY.

THE FAA IS PLANNING A MEETING ON MAY 23 IN FORT WORTH, TEXAS, WITH REGULATORS FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO UPDATE THEM ON REVIEWS OF BOEING\u2019S SOFTWARE FIX AND ON PILOT TRAINING.

BOEING HAS OUTSOLD THE A350-1000 ALMOST TWO TO ONE WITH ITS 777X, BUT ITS ORDER BOOK IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON GULF CARRIERS WHOSE EXPANSION PLANS LOOK INCREASINGLY FRAGILE, ANALYSTS SAY.

SO WE ARE HAVING TO DO SOME RE-TESTING, AND THEY\u2019RE WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THAT.\u201d  THE MARKET FOR WIDEBODY JETS HAS BEEN FRAGILE DUE TO OVERSUPPLY AND FEARS OVER THE ECONOMY AND TRADE DISPUTES.

ONE AIRLINE SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH THE PROGRAM SAID THE FLIGHT TEST SCHEDULE HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN SET AT 14 MONTHS, BUT HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY OVER AIRCRAFT CERTIFICATION AFTER TWO 737 MAX CRASHES IN OCTOBER AND MARCH MEANS THAT SCHEDULE IS UNLIKELY TO BE ACCELERATED.  THAT MEANS THE 777X IS MORE LIKELY TO BE HANDED OVER TO AIRLINES TOWARD THE END OF 2020, AND THAT DATE COULD SLIP INTO 2021, AIRLINE SOURCES SAID AT AN INDUSTRY GATHERING IN SEOUL THIS WEEK.

FILE PHOTO: BOEING CO CHIEF EXECUTIVE DENNIS MUILENBURG SPEAKS DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, U.S., APRIL 29, 2019. JIM YOUNG/POOL VIA REUTERS  CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE DENNIS MUILENBURG SAID BOEING FAILED TO COMMUNICATE \u201cCRISPLY\u201d WITH REGULATORS AND CUSTOMERS, BUT DEFENDED THE BROAD ENGINEERING AND DESIGN APPROACH TO NOSE-DOWN CONTROL SOFTWARE AT THE CENTER OF PROBES INTO THE ACCIDENTS THAT LED TO THE PLANE\u2019S WORLDWIDE GROUNDING.  MUILENBURG ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPANY MADE A MISTAKE IN FAILING TO DISCLOSE A DEFECTIVE COCKPIT WARNING LIGHT ON ITS 737 MAX TO REGULATORS AND CUSTOMERS, AND SAID THAT FAILURE HAS BEEN PART OF REVIEWS BY GLOBAL REGULATORS.  MUILENBURG, WHO HAS BEEN UNDER FIRE OVER THE MAX DESIGN AND BOEING\u2019S HANDLING OF THE CRISIS, SAID \u201cWE ARE SEEING OVER TIME MORE AND MORE CONVERGENCE AMONG THE REGULATORS\u201d ON WHEN THE MAX SHOULD RETURN TO SERVICE.  HE SAID HE EXPECTED THE MAX TO RETURN TO SERVICE THIS YEAR AND THAT 90% OF CUSTOMERS HAD PARTICIPATED IN SIMULATOR SESSIONS WITH ITS UPGRADED MCAS SOFTWARE AS THE COMPANY WORKS TOWARD A CERTIFICATION FLIGHT WITH REGULATORS SOON.  BOEING SAYS IT FOLLOWED LONG-STANDING ENGINEERING PROCEDURES WHEN DESIGNING THE 737 MAX. ASKED HOW THE PROCEDURES FAILED TO CAPTURE APPARENT FLAWS IN MCAS CONTROL SOFTWARE AND SENSOR ARCHITECTURE, MUILENBURG SAID: \u201cCLEARLY, WE CAN MAKE IMPROVEMENTS, AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND WE WILL MAKE THOSE IMPROVEMENTS.\u201d  HE ADDED: \u201cWHEN I MAKE COMMENTS ABOUT THE PREVIOUS MCAS DESIGN AND HOW WE FOLLOWED THOSE PROCESSES, THAT\u2019S SOMETHING WE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT AND DEPTH OF ANALYSIS INTO. THAT DOESN\u2019T MEAN THAT IT CAN\u2019T BE IMPROVED.\u201d  MUILENBURG\u2019S COMMENTS ON THE EVE OF THE PARIS AIRSHOW HIGHLIGHT EFFORTS BY BOEING TO STRIKE A DIFFERENT TONE THAN IT DID IN THE DAYS AFTER THE LION AIR CRASH IN OCTOBER, WHEN IT RAISED QUESTIONS OVER PILOT AND MAINTENANCE ISSUES.  MUILENBURG SAID THE U.S. PLANEMAKER EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE SOME ORDERS AT THE SHOW FOR WIDER-BODY JETS, BUT THAT ITS MAIN FOCUS AT THIS YEAR\u2019S INDUSTRY GATHERING WAS SAFETY.  HE FORECAST A $8.7 TRILLION MARKETPLACE FOR BOEING\u2019S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OVER 10 YEARS, UP FROM THE $8.1 TRILLION IT PROJECTED LAST YEAR, AND PREDICTED THE WORLD WOULD NEED 44,000 COMMERCIAL JETS OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS, UP FROM THE 43,000 BOEING FORECAST IN LAST YEAR\u2019S ESTIMATE.  HE STUCK TO A PREVIOUS TIMELINE FOR THE ALL-NEW 777X TWIN-AISLE JET, WHICH BOEING AIMS TO FLY LATER THIS YEAR AND DELIVER TO AIRLINES IN 2020.  HE SAID A POSSIBLE NEW JET DUBBED NMA HAD FALLEN BEHIND THE MAX\u2019S RETURN TO SERVICE AS A PRIORITY, BUT THAT THE TIMELINE ON DECISIONS AND ENTRY TO SERVICE REMAINED UNCHANGED.  HE TOOK AIM AT EUROPEAN RIVAL AIRBUS\u2019S PLANNED NEW EXTENDED-RANGE A321XLR, SAYING THE AIRCRAFT WOULD ONLY \u201cSCRATCH AN EDGE\u201d OF THE MARKET SEGMENT TARGETED BY THE NMA, WHICH WOULD REPLACE BOEING\u2019S 757S AND 767S.  WHETHER OR NOT BOEING MOVES FORWARD WITH THE NEW MID-SIZED PLANE TO SERVE A NICHE MARKET FALLING BETWEEN NARROW- AND WIDE-BODY AIRCRAFT IS EXPECTED TO RESHAPE COMPETITION WITH AIRBUS, WHICH DOMINATES THE TOP END OF THE MEDIUM-HAUL SECTOR.  ASKED WHETHER HE HAD BEEN INTERVIEWED OR SUBMITTED EVIDENCE IN AN ONGOING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION LAUNCHED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN THE WAKE OF THE 737 CRASHES, MUILENBURG SAID, \u201cWE ARE FULLY SUPPORTING ANY GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND PROVIDING INFORMATION.\u201d", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2019-06-17T00:00:00", "key": "20190617BA", "labelr0": 2.2295195298997443, "labelr1": 5.370526908988448, "labelr2": -1.4440047063857038, "labelr3": 1.714781853700888, "labelr4": -0.8109261630388446, "pos": 0.504, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.7964, "0_day_return": 2.229519529899737, "1_day_return": 2.229519529899737, "2_day_return": 3.8489715412792336, "3_day_return": 5.629754860524082, "4_day_return": 4.773175542406283, "label": 1, "return": 0.00971739982695503, "excess_return": 2.2198021300727824, "count_of_word": 597, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.52969766, "prof1": 0.47030237, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4832247257053338, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5167752742946662, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.52969766, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.47030237, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.34792852, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.6520715, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5381752, "tr_prof1": 0.4618248, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5287509, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.47124907, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.4319161, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.5680839, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.26630044, "headline_prof21": 0.73369956, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.49482653, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5051734999999999, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.53735894, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.4626411, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.6508145000000001, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.3491855, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": -2.229519529899737, "returnpredvader": 2.229519529899737, "returnpredsgd": 2.229519529899737, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0119447568628643, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.975457622255518, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0291932969162285, "cumreturn1b": 1.1457846502069209, "cumreturn1d": 0.9871217785752769, "cumreturn1e": 1.1409161738617968, "cumreturndow": 1.1523772553813514, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1294054616113565}, {"Unnamed: 0": 8065, "Unnamed: 0.1": 8065, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 8065, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 8065, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 8065, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 8065, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8065, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8065, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 8065, "level_0": 8065, "index": 8065, "text": "SEOUL, JUNE 19 (REUTERS) - SOUTH KOREA\u2019S BIGGEST CARRIER KOREAN AIR LINES SAID ON WEDNESDAY IT HAS SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING TO BUY 30 BOEING PLANES FOR $9.67 BILLION.

AIRBUS ANNOUNCED A NEW VERSION OF ITS BEST-SELLING A321 WITH CLOSE TO 240 ORDERS AND COMMITMENTS IN PARIS, ONLY TO SEE ITS GRIP ON IAG\u2019S EUROPEAN SHORT-HAUL NETWORKS DAMAGED BY THE BOEING DEAL WHICH ANALYSTS SAID SHORES UP THE EMBATTLED 737 MAX.  BOEING\u2019S TOP-SELLING AIRCRAFT HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE WORLDWIDE SINCE AN ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES 737 MAX CRASHED IN MARCH, FIVE MONTHS AFTER A LION AIR 737 MAX PLUNGED INTO THE SEA OFF INDONESIA. A TOTAL OF 346 PEOPLE DIED IN THE TWO DISASTERS.  TUESDAY\u2019S BLOCKBUSTER ORDER, WORTH MORE THAN $24 BILLION AT LIST PRICES, WAS PARTLY SEEN AS AN EFFORT TO PRESERVE COMPETITION BETWEEN PLANEMAKERS, DAMAGED BY THE THREE-MONTH-OLD GROUNDING CRISIS. BUT IT JOLTED AIRBUS WHICH WAS CAUGHT UNAWARES AFTER SIGNING A SMALLER ORDER FOR A321XLRS WITH IAG.  WRAPPING UP THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST AIR SHOW ON THURSDAY, AIRBUS PUBLICLY VOICED ITS FRUSTRATION OVER THE DEAL AND URGED IAG TO RUN A COMPETITION FOR THE PLANES, WHICH WOULD BE DEPLOYED AT VUELING, IBERIA, AER LINGUS, LEVEL AND PART OF BA.  \u201cWE WOULD LIKE A CHANCE TO COMPETE FOR THAT BUSINESS,\u201d CHIEF COMMERCIAL OFFICER CHRISTIAN SCHERER TOLD REPORTERS, ADDING THAT IAG HAD NOT ISSUED A FORMAL TENDER FOR THE NARROW-BODY ORDER.  IAG WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR COMMENT, BUT SAID EARLIER IN THE WEEK THAT IT DID NOT COMMENT ON NEGOTIATIONS.  BOEING DECLINED COMMENT.  FRAYED TRUCE  THE SHOCK ANNOUNCEMENT OF A TENTATIVE ORDER FOR 200 737 MAX JETS FROM IAG STUNNED THE INDUSTRY AND FRAYED AN UNUSUAL PR TRUCE BETWEEN THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST PLANEMAKERS AFTER AIRBUS HAD PUBLICLY SUPPORTED BOEING OVER THE GROUNDING.  COMMERCIAL RIVALRY REMAINS FIERCE, WITH AIRBUS LAUNCHING ITS A321XLR - A LONGER-RANGE VERSION OF ITS A321 - TO TRY TO REDUCE THE SPACE LEFT FOR BOEING AS IT DRAWS UP DESIGNS FOR A NEW 220-270-SEATER IN THE SO-CALLED MIDDLE OF THE JET MARKET.  AIRBUS REPORTED 383 ORDERS AND COMMITMENTS INCLUDING 239 FOR THE A321XLR. BOEING\u2019S FIRM AND TENTATIVE ORDERS CAME TO 247. BOTH ARE SUFFERING FROM SLOWER IN DEMAND AFTER A LONG UPSWING.

AIRBUS ANNOUNCED A LAST-MINUTE ORDER FOR 13 OF THE XLR JETS FROM U.S. BUDGET CARRIER JETBLUE AIRWAYS, WHICH IS EXPANDING INTO THE CUT-THROAT TRANSATLANTIC MARKET, JOINING A VARIED LIST OF BACKERS INCLUDING AMERICAN AIRLINES.  AIRBUS HOPES TO DERAIL BOEING\u2019S PLANS FOR A MID-MARKET JET IN A GAP BETWEEN TRADITIONAL NARROW-BODY AND WIDE-BODY JETS BY DOMINATING THE LOWER END, WHERE ITS A321 OUTSELLS BOEING.  BUT IT IS MORE VULNERABLE AT THE TOP END WHERE ITS A330NEO WIDE-BODY JET IS UP AGAINST TOUGH COMPETITION FROM THE NEWER BOEING 787. AIRBUS GRABBED KEY ORDERS FROM PHILIPPINES CARRIER CEBU AIR AND VIRGIN ATLANTIC, WHILE KOREAN AIR TOOK 20 787S.  YET THE BIGGEST ISSUE HOVERING OVER THE SHOW WAS THE GROUNDING OF THE MAX, WHICH SECURES SUPPLIER PROFITS FOR THE NEXT DECADE, WHILE ON THE DEFENSE SIDE OF THE SHOW A FRANCO-GERMAN PAIRING AND TURKEY EACH UNVEILED NEW FIGHTER DESIGNS.  THE IAG DEAL MARKED A PSYCHOLOGICAL TURNING POINT FOR THE FIVE-DECADE-OLD 737 SERIES THOUGH BOEING AVOIDED WADING INTO THE TRADITIONAL DING-DONG WITH AIRBUS OVER WHO WON THE SHOW, AS IT STRIKES A MORE SOMBER TONE THAN USUAL FOLLOWING THE CRASHES.  BOEING DID, HOWEVER, SAY IT WAS IN TALKS WITH OTHER AIRLINES FOR SALES OF ITS 737 MAX AFTER THE IAG DEAL.  SLIDESHOW (2 IMAGES)  SENIOR VICE-PRESIDENT IHSSANE MOUNIR DISMISSED THE A321XLR AS SUITABLE FOR ONLY A \u201cSLIVER\u201d OF THE MARKET THAT BOEING HOPES TO WIN WITH ITS PROPOSED ALL-NEW MID-MARKET PLANE.  THE TWO SIDES ALSO TRADED BLOWS OVER COMPETITION FOR WIDE-BODY JETS, WITH EACH SCORING KEY WINS IN ASIA.  BOEING HAD OPENED THE SHOW ON A SUBDUED NOTE WITH APOLOGIES OVER LIVES LOST IN THE MAX CRASHES. IT SUFFERED A FURTHER SETBACK WHEN GENERAL ELECTRIC DISCLOSED A DELAY OF MONTHS IN SUPPLYING ENGINES FOR THE NEW 777X WIDE-BODY AIRCRAFT.

REUTERS/LINDSEY WASSON/FILE PHOTO  THE MEETING, ORGANIZED BY INDUSTRY TRADE GROUP THE INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION (IATA), COMES AS AIRLINES GRAPPLE WITH THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF A GLOBAL GROUNDING OF NEARLY 400 737 MAX JETS THAT HAS LASTED THREE MONTHS.  BOEING, THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST PLANEMAKER, HAS YET TO FORMALLY SUBMIT PROPOSED 737 MAX SOFTWARE AND TRAINING UPDATES TO THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (FAA), WHICH WILL KICK-START A RE-CERTIFICATION PROCESS THAT COULD TAKE WEEKS.  IATA DIRECTOR GENERAL ALEXANDRE DE JUNIAC HAS SAID \u201cSHORING UP TRUST AMONG REGULATORS AND IMPROVING COORDINATION\u201d WITHIN AN INDUSTRY THAT GROUNDED THE MAX PLANES ON DIFFERENT DATES IN MARCH WOULD BE PRIORITIES AT WEDNESDAY\u2019S SUMMIT.  IT IS THE SECOND SUCH MEETING ORGANIZED BY IATA.  CHINA WAS FIRST TO GROUND THE MAX AFTER A MARCH 10 CRASH IN ETHIOPIA WITHIN FIVE MONTHS OF A SIMILAR CRASH OFF INDONESIA, KILLING A COMBINED 346 PEOPLE, WHILE THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA WERE THE LAST.  REGULATORS INCLUDING TRANSPORT CANADA, THE CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE AND THE FAA WILL JOIN AIRLINES AT THE MEETING, REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE AUTHORITIES TOLD REUTERS.  ONCE REGULATORS APPROVE THE MAX FOR FLIGHT, AIRLINES MUST REMOVE THE JETS FROM STORAGE AND IMPLEMENT NEW PILOT TRAINING, A PROCESS THAT WILL DIFFER FOR EACH AIRLINE BUT THAT U.S. CARRIERS HAVE SAID WILL TAKE AT LEAST ONE MONTH.  SOME AIRLINES AND REGULATORS HAVE ARGUED THAT PILOTS SHOULD BE TRAINED IN A MAX SIMULATOR BEFORE FLYING, THOUGH BOEING\u2019S MINIMUM TRAINING REQUIREMENTS DO NOT CALL FOR FLIGHT SIMULATORS, ACCORDING TO DRAFT PROPOSALS.  \u201cTRAINING IS UP TO EACH REGULATOR. WHEN THE MAX RETURNS TO THE SKIES, WITH THE UPDATED SOFTWARE AND REQUIRED TRAINING, IT WILL BE ONE OF THE SAFEST AIRPLANES EVER TO FLY,\u201d BOEING SPOKESMAN PAUL BERGMAN SAID.

FILE PHOTO: EMPLOYEES WALK BY THE END OF A 737 MAX AIRCRAFT AT THE BOEING FACTORY IN RENTON, WASHINGTON, U.S., MARCH 27, 2019.

WHILE THE MEETING WAS NOT CALLED IN RESPONSE TO THE MAX CRASHES IN INDONESIA LAST OCTOBER AND IN ETHIOPIA IN MARCH, IT COINCIDES WITH A LARGER DEBATE ON WHETHER INCREASINGLY AUTOMATED COMMERCIAL JETS ARE COMPROMISING PILOT SKILLS. THE 737 MAX HAS BEEN GROUNDED WORLDWIDE AND COULD NOT BE BACK IN SERVICE FOR MONTHS YET.  MOST ATTENTION SURROUNDING THE TWO 737 MAX CRASHES THAT KILLED A TOTAL OF 346 PEOPLE FOCUSES ON SUSPECTED FLAWS IN AN AUTOMATED STALL-PREVENTION SYSTEM CALLED MCAS, WHICH BOEING CO (BA.N) IMPLEMENTED TO MAKE THE MAX PERFORM LIKE PREVIOUS 737 MODELS.

MARIN CALLED THE MEETING A \u201cFIRST STEP,\u201d WITH ANY EVENTUAL CHANGE UP TO REGULATORS.  IN THE UNITED STATES, THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION INCREASED THE NUMBER OF REQUIRED TRAINING HOURS FOR COMMERCIAL PILOTS FROM 250 TO 1,500 IN 2013, A MOVE THAT SOME PLAYERS HAVE CRITICIZED AS EXCESSIVE, PARTICULARLY AS THE INDUSTRY GRAPPLES WITH FUTURE PILOT SHORTAGES.

FILE PHOTO: ERIC LINDBLAD, VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL MANAGER OF THE BOEING 777X, SPEAKS AT BOEING'S PRODUCTION FACILITY IN EVERETT, WASHINGTON, U.S. JUNE 1, 2017. REUTERS/JASON REDMOND  KEVIN MCALLISTER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF BOEING\u2019S COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES DIVISION, STRESSED IN THE MEMO THAT THE SO-CALLED NEW MID-MARKET AIRPLANE (NMA) PROJECT WOULD REMAIN AS A PROGRAM.  BUT THE MANAGEMENT SHAKEUP MARKS A SHIFT IN THE U.S. PLANEMAKER\u2019S IMMEDIATE FOCUS TOWARD GETTING ITS BEST-SELLING 737 MAX, THE JET THAT WAS GROUNDED AFTER TWO CRASHES KILLED NEARLY 350 PEOPLE IN THE SPAN OF FIVE MONTHS, BACK IN THE AIR AND GENERATING CASH.  BOEING\u2019S 737 PROGRAM MANAGER, ERIC LINDBLAD, WILL RETIRE IN A MATTER OF WEEKS AFTER ROUGHLY 12 MONTHS ON THE JOB, MCALLISTER TOLD EMPLOYEES IN THE MEMO. LINDBLAD, A RESPECTED ENGINEER WHO HAD ALSO RUN THE 777X WIDE-BODY PROGRAM, HAS BEEN WITH BOEING FOR ABOUT 34 YEARS AND HAD MENTIONED RETIRING LAST YEAR, MCALLISTER SAID.  TAKING LINDBLAD\u2019S PLACE AS THE LEAD OF THE 737 PROGRAM AND THE RENTON, WASHINGTON, FACTORY WILL BE MARK JENKS, WHO HAS BEEN LEADING BOEING\u2019S POTENTIAL NEW MID-MARKET AIRPLANE PROJECT, MCALLISTER SAID.  JENKS FACES DAUNTING CHALLENGES, INCLUDING UNTANGLING A BACKLOG OF UNDELIVERED PLANES, GETTING PRODUCTION BACK ON COURSE FOR PLANNED OUTPUT INCREASES, AND FINISHING DEVELOPMENT OF THE 737 MAX 10, THE LARGEST BOEING SINGLE-AISLE JET, SOURCES SAID.  THE STAKES ARE HIGH AS THE 737 IS THE BACKBONE OF BOEING\u2019S PROFITS AND MUST GENERATE CASH FOR NEW PROJECTS LIKE THE NMA.  DESCRIBED AS A \u201cQUIET, GET-ON-AND-DO-IT\u201d ENGINEER, JENKS SPENT HALF OF HIS 36-YEAR BOEING CAREER ON THE 787 AND AN EARLIER ALTERNATIVE THAT WAS NEVER LAUNCHED, THE SONIC CRUISER.  BOEING HAS BEEN RUNNING ITS 737 SUPPLY CHAIN AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS TO KEEP IT \u201cHOT\u201d OR READY TO RESUME FULL-RATE PRODUCTION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER THE CRISIS ENDS, POSING LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS LAST SEEN ON SUCH A SCALE WHEN THE 787 DREAMLINER WAS RAMPING UP.  NMA DELAYED  MIKE SINNETT, BOEING COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES VICE PRESIDENT OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND FUTURE AIRPLANE DEVELOPMENT, WILL ASSUME THE ROLE OF VICE PRESIDENT FOR NMA IN ADDITION TO HIS CURRENT ROLE, THE MEMO SAID. SINNETT, WHO ORIGINALLY LED PRELIMINARY WORK ON THE NMA, HAS BEEN SEEN A FIGUREHEAD OF THE PROGRAM.  \u201cLET ME BE CLEAR - THE NMA TEAM WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE AS A PROGRAM, AND I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO MIKE\u2019S LEADERSHIP IN THIS IMPORTANT EFFORT,\u201d MCALLISTER SAID IN THE MEMO.  IN NAMING JENKS AND SINNETT TO RUN MARQUEE PROJECTS AT SUCH A CRUCIAL TIME, MCALLISTER IS CHOOSING TWO OF BOEING\u2019S MOST HIGH-PROFILE ENGINEERS.  JENKS IS AMONG THOSE CREDITED WITH TURNING AROUND THE 787 DREAMLINER PROGRAM, AND HIS APPOINTMENT ON THE NMA WAS SEEN AS KEY TO PUTTING THE POTENTIAL TWIN-AISLE AIRCRAFT ON A PATH TO A RAPID LAUNCH.  SLIDESHOW (2 IMAGES)  BUT INDUSTRY SOURCES SAY THE LAUNCH OF THE NMA HAS BEEN DELAYED BY THE 737 MAX CRISIS. THE NMA PROGRAM, IF IT GOES AHEAD, WILL MOST LIKELY NOT BE LAUNCHED BEFORE SPRING OR SUMMER OF NEXT YEAR, THE SOURCES SAID.  IT WAS THE SECOND MANAGEMENT RESHUFFLE IN FOUR MONTHS.

THE DECISION HAD BEEN EXPECTED AFTER BOEING SAID ON JUNE 27 IT WOULD LIKELY TAKE UNTIL AT LEAST SEPTEMBER TO FIX A FRESH FLAW IN THE GROUNDED 737 MAX DISCOVERED BY THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION LAST MONTH.  UNITED HAD PREVIOUSLY LEFT ITS 14 737 MAX JETS OFF ITS FLIGHT SCHEDULE THROUGH EARLY SEPTEMBER.  THE NEW POTENTIAL RISK MUST BE ADDRESSED BEFORE THE AIRCRAFT CAN RETURN TO SERVICE SINCE TWO DEADLY CRASHES IN ETHIOPIA AND INDONESIA LED TO ITS WORLDWIDE GROUNDING IN MARCH.  ONCE REGULATORS APPROVE THE MAX FOR FLIGHT, EACH AIRCRAFT WILL LIKELY REQUIRE BETWEEN 100 AND 150 HOURS OF MAINTENANCE PREPARATION BEFORE FLYING, IN ADDITION TO NEW PILOT TRAINING, AIRLINE OFFICIALS HAVE SAID.  AMONG OTHER U.S. MAX OPERATORS, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO SO FAR HAS CANCELED FLIGHTS THROUGH OCT. 1 AND AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP THROUGH SEPT. 3, THOUGH THOSE TIMELINES ARE ALSO LIKELY TO BE EXTENDED.  WHILE THE THREE U.S. AIRLINES\u2019 MAX JETS ACCOUNT FOR ONLY A FRACTION OF THEIR ENTIRE FLEET, THE GROUNDING HAS FORCED ABOUT 150 DAILY FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS FOR SOUTHWEST AND 115 FOR AMERICAN.  UNITED IS DUE ON TUESDAY TO PUBLISH SECOND-QUARTER RESULTS, WHICH INVESTORS ARE HOPING WILL PROVIDE DETAILS ON THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE GROUNDING.  UNIT REVENUES, BASED ON PER AVAILABLE SEAT MILE, COULD BENEFIT AS PLANES FLY WITH MORE PASSENGERS.

DELIVERIES REMAIN FROZEN UNTIL REGULATORS APPROVE THE MAX\u2019S RETURN TO SERVICE.  SOME ANALYSTS DO NOT EXPECT THE JET TO FLY COMMERCIALLY BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR.  THE 737 MAX WAS GROUNDED WORLDWIDE IN MARCH AFTER AN ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES PLANE PLUNGED TO THE GROUND SOON AFTER TAKE-OFF, FIVE MONTHS AFTER A SIMILAR LION AIR FATAL CRASH OFF THE COAST OF INDONESIA.

FILE PHOTO: AN AMERICAN AIRLINES BOEING 737 MAX 8 FLIGHT FROM LOS ANGELES APPROACHES FOR LANDING AT REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT SHORTLY AFTER AN ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE BY THE FAA THAT THE PLANES WERE BEING GROUNDED BY THE UNITED STATES OVER SAFETY ISSUES IN WASHINGTON, U.S. MARCH 13, 2019. REUTERS/JOSHUA ROBERTS/FILE PHOTO  \u201cIT\u2019S REALLY ALL ABOUT THE MAX. IT\u2019S THE ONLY THING WE\u2019RE DEALING WITH,\u201d SOUTHWEST CHIEF EXECUTIVE GARY KELLY TOLD INVESTORS AFTER TAKING A $175 MILLION HIT TO OPERATING INCOME IN THE SECOND QUARTER FROM THE MAX GROUNDING.  \u201cEVERYTHING ELSE IS ROCK SOLID,\u201d KELLY SAID, POINTING TO RISING REVENUES AND COST MANAGEMENT, EXCLUDING COSTS RELATED TO ROUGHLY 150 DAILY FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS AS THE AIRLINE MANAGES ITS OPERATIONS WITH A SLIMMER FLEET.  THOSE COSTS ARE SET TO RISE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, THE AIRLINE SAID.  SOUTHWEST AND AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC (AAL.O) ARE THE TWO LARGEST U.S. MAX OPERATORS, WITH 34 AND 24 JETS RESPECTIVELY AND DOZENS MORE ON ORDER. CARRIERS THAT RUSHED TO BUY BOEING\u2019S FUEL-EFFICIENT JETS TO OPEN NEW AND LONGER ROUTES HAVE BEEN REELING FROM A GLOBAL GROUNDING IN MARCH THAT FOLLOWED TWO FATAL CRASHES IN ETHIOPIA AND INDONESIA.  AMERICAN, THE NO. 1 U.S. AIRLINE, SAID IT EXPECTED THE GROUNDING TO HIT ITS 2019 PRE-TAX EARNINGS BY ABOUT $400 MILLION, ABOUT $50 MILLION MORE THAN IT HAD PREVIOUSLY FORECAST.  THE TIMING OF THE MAX\u2019S RETURN TO SERVICE IS STILL UNCERTAIN.  THE ACTING ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, WHICH MUST APPROVE BOEING\u2019S SOFTWARE FIXES AND NEW PILOT TRAINING BEFORE THE MAX CAN FLY AGAIN, SAID ON THURSDAY THE TIMELINE WOULD BE DRIVEN BY ONE CRITERIA: SAFETY.  BASED ON GUIDANCE FROM BOEING, SOUTHWEST EXTENDED MAX-RELATED CANCELLATIONS UNTIL JAN. 5, 2020, SAYING IT WILL NEED ONE TO TWO MONTHS FOLLOWING REGULATORY APPROVAL TO TRAIN PILOTS AND PREPARE THE JETS FOR FRESH COMMERCIAL SERVICE.  IT HAD PREVIOUSLY REMOVED THE MAX JETS FROM ITS FLYING SCHEDULE THROUGH EARLY NOVEMBER, A TIMELINE THAT AMERICAN MAINTAINED ON THURSDAY, DESPITE SKEPTICISM BY ANALYSTS.  SHARES IN AMERICAN WERE DOWN ABOUT 4.7% ON THURSDAY WHILE SOUTHWEST GAINED 1.6%, RECOVERING FROM OPENING LOSSES.  SCRAMBLING TO GROW  LACKING PLANES, SOUTHWEST SAID IT WAS FREEZING NEW PILOT HIRES AND UPGRADES AND CEASING SERVICE FROM UNDERPERFORMING NEWARK, WHERE IT HAD UP TO 20 DAILY DEPARTURES, TO CONSOLIDATE ITS NEW YORK CITY SERVICE AT NEARBY LAGUARDIA IN EARLY NOVEMBER.  HOWEVER, THE AIRLINE IS RESUMING ITS GROWTH PLANS IN CALIFORNIA AND HAWAII NEXT MONTH, KELLY SAID. THE AIRLINE CANNOT AFFORD COMPETITIVELY TO WAIT ANY LONGER, HE SAID.  THE LOW-COST CARRIER LAUNCHED HAWAII FLIGHTS THIS YEAR. TO HELP SERVICE THAT EXPANSION, IT IS DELAYING THE RETIREMENT OF SEVEN 737-700 AIRCRAFT.  STILL, SOUTHWEST SAID ITS FLYING CAPACITY WILL NOW FALL BY AS MUCH AS 2% THIS YEAR, A REVERSAL FROM ITS EARLIER FORECAST OF 5% GROWTH. AMERICAN\u2019S CAPACITY WILL STILL GROW IN 2019, THE AIRLINE SAID, BUT AT A SLOWER RATE THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED.  BOTH SOUTHWEST AND AMERICAN SAID THEY HAVE HELD DISCUSSIONS WITH BOEING ABOUT MAX-RELATED DAMAGES BUT HAVE NOT REACHED ANY CONCLUSIONS.  BOEING, WHICH POSTED ITS LARGEST-EVER QUARTERLY LOSS ON WEDNESDAY AND WARNED IT MAY HAVE TO HALT 737 MAX PRODUCTION, HAS TAKEN A $4.9 BILLION CHARGE LINKED TO CUSTOMER COMPENSATION.  FEWER SEATS, HIGHER REVENUES  WITH FEWER PLANES FLYING IN A STRONG DOMESTIC AIR TRAVEL MARKET, AIRLINES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE MORE FOR SEATS, LEADING TO STRONGER RISES IN UNIT REVENUES, BASED ON PER AVAILABLE SEAT MILE, FOR AMERICAN AND SOUTHWEST AS WELL AS ITS MAIN RIVALS.  THAT TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE INTO THE THIRD QUARTER  AN AMERICAN AIRLINES AIRPLANE SITS ON THE TARMAC AT LAX IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, U.S., MARCH 4, 2019. PICTURE TAKEN MARCH 4, 2019. REUTERS/LUCY NICHOLSON  AMERICAN\u2019S TOTAL OPERATING REVENUE ROSE 3% TO $11.96 BILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER FROM A YEAR EARLIER, WHILE SOUTHWEST\u2019S GREW 2.9% TO $5.9 BILLION, A QUARTERLY RECORD FOR BOTH.  AMERICAN SAID IT WAS EXTENDING THE LIFESPAN OF SOME OF ITS OTHER 737 MODELS AS WELL AS SOME 757S AND A320S. BUT ASIDE FROM MAX WOES, AMERICAN IS ALSO DEALING WITH ABOUT A DOZEN DAILY CANCELLATIONS IT ATTRIBUTES TO WORK SLOWDOWNS BY ITS TWO MAIN MECHANICS UNIONS, WHICH NEED NEW CONTRACTS.  THE UNIONS HAVE DENIED AN INTENTIONAL SLOWDOWN AND THE ISSUE IS BEING DISPUTED IN COURT, THOUGH AMERICAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE DOUG PARKER SAID HE WAS DETERMINED TO GET A LABOR CONTRACT IN PLACE.", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2019-07-25T00:00:00", "key": "20190725BA", "labelr0": -3.69089450239328, "labelr1": -0.8877014565198584, "labelr2": -1.3884057971014552, "labelr3": 2.131036712618677, "labelr4": -1.8074022909111764, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.254, "compound": -0.5267, "0_day_return": -3.690894502393281, "1_day_return": -0.8877014565198627, "2_day_return": -2.2637823551380443, "3_day_return": -0.18098767560115192, "4_day_return": -1.9851187911172463, "label": -1, "return": 0.0073876909168583155, "excess_return": -0.8950891474367209, "count_of_word": 771, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.41211072, "prof1": 0.58788925, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.491329360442005, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.508670639557995, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.41211072, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.58788925, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.24100304, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.758997, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.49816847, "tr_prof1": 0.50183153, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5810944, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.4189055999999999, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.56706345, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.4329365, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.5337765999999999, "headline_prof21": 0.46622342, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.39818004, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.60182, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.35024944, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.64975053, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.5575197, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.4424803, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -0.8877014565198627, "returnpredvader": 0.8877014565198627, "returnpredsgd": -0.8877014565198627, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9928138752657255, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.997230397024366, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9884169133445134, "cumreturn1b": 1.3245656978548868, "cumreturn1d": 0.9429459490396306, "cumreturn1e": 1.2088291540017484, "cumreturndow": 1.1950757828027017, "cumreturnsp500": 1.16042603891125}, {"Unnamed: 0": 9777, "Unnamed: 0.1": 9777, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 9777, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 9777, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 9777, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 9777, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 9777, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 9777, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 9777, "level_0": 9777, "index": 9777, "text": "DUBLIN (REUTERS) - RYANAIR (RYA.I) IS WORRIED THAT FURTHER DELAYS IN THE RETURN OF BOEING\u2019S 737 MAX TO SERVICE COULD LEAVE IT WITHOUT ANY OF THE JETS NEXT SUMMER, FORCING IT TO CUT ITS GROWTH PLANS FURTHER.

THE TESTS INDICATE THE FAA IS MAKING PROGRESS IN THE RE-APPROVAL PROCESS OF THE MAX FOR COMMERCIAL FLIGHT. BOEING CO\u2019S LATEST 737 NARROWBODY MODEL, THE MAX, WAS GROUNDED WORLDWIDE IN MARCH FOLLOWING TWO FATAL CRASHES IN INDONESIA AND ETHIOPIA THAT KILLED 346 PEOPLE WITHIN FIVE MONTHS.  SINCE THEN, AIRLINES THAT RUSHED TO BUY THE MAX TO SERVICE NEW AND LONGER ROUTES WITH THE JET\u2019S FUEL-EFFICIENT ENGINES HAVE HAD TO CANCEL THOUSANDS OF FLIGHTS AS THEY MANAGE SLIMMER FLEETS, EATING INTO THEIR PROFITABILITY.  BOEING, THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST PLANEMAKER, HAS SAID IT IS WORKING TOWARD GETTING THE 737 MAX FLYING AGAIN COMMERCIALLY IN THE EARLY FOURTH QUARTER, ONCE THE FAA APPROVES NEW PILOT TRAINING AND REPROGRAMMED SOFTWARE FOR A STALL-PREVENTION SYSTEM AT THE CENTER OF BOTH CRASHES.  AS PART OF ITS OWN TESTING PROCESS BOEING HAS INVITED SENIOR U.S. AIRLINE PILOTS TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE SOFTWARE FIX AND USE SIMULATORS TO RUN SCENARIOS SIMILAR TO THE ONES THAT LED TO THE TWO CRASHES. BUT THE FAA WANTS TO OBSERVE RELATIVELY INEXPERIENCED 737 PILOTS, THE SOURCES SAID ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY BECAUSE THE TESTS ARE CONFIDENTIAL.  TO DO SO, THE FAA ASKED SOUTHWEST AIRLINES, AMERICAN AIRLINES AND UNITED AIRLINES - THE THREE U.S. CARRIERS THAT OPERATE THE MAX - TO PROVIDE THE NAMES OF NEWER 737 LINE PILOTS WHO HAVE FLOWN THE MAX AT LEAST ONCE, THEY SAID.  THE EXACT NATURE OF THE TESTS, WHICH THEY SAID IS LIKELY A FIRST STEP TOWARD CREATING A WIDER TEST GROUP, WAS STILL BEING DECIDED BUT COULD INCLUDE A SCENARIO DISCOVERED BY THE FAA IN JUNE THAT SHOWED A MICROPROCESSOR FLAW CAUSING AN UNCOMMANDED MOVEMENT OF THE PLANE\u2019S HORIZONTAL TAIL WHICH TOOK TEST CREW TOO LONG TO RECOGNIZE AS A LOSS OF CONTROL KNOWN AS RUNAWAY STABILIZER.  ONE SOURCE SAID THE TEST WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CONDUCTED DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER BUT HAS BEEN PUSHED BACK TO THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH.  BOEING DECLINED TO COMMENT WHILE THE FAA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY COMMENT.  THE CHICAGO-BASED PLANEMAKER STARTED DELIVERING THE MAX, ITS FASTEST-SELLING AIRCRAFT, IN 2017 BEFORE MORE THAN 50 AIRLINES WORLDWIDE WERE FORCED TO PARK SOME 380 JETS.  SINCE APRIL BOEING HAS BEEN RUNNING RIGOROUS ROUNDS OF TEST FLIGHTS WITH THE NEW SOFTWARE, BOTH IN FLIGHT SIMULATORS AND IN THE AIR, AS IT LOOKS TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF ITS BEST-SELLING AIRCRAFT, WITH ABOUT 5,000 PENDING ORDERS.  SOUTHWEST, THE LARGEST MAX OPERATOR WITH 34 JETS, HAS REMOVED THE AIRCRAFT FROM ITS FLIGHT SCHEDULING UNTIL EARLY 2020, WHILE AMERICAN AND UNITED HAVE SCHEDULED WITHOUT THE MAX UNTIL EARLY NOVEMBER, LEADING TO HUNDREDS OF DAILY FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS.  THE LONGER THE GROUNDING LASTS, THE HARSHER THE IMPACT ON AIRLINES THAT HAVE BEEN AWAITING NEW MAX DELIVERIES.  SEPARATELY, SOURCES TOLD REUTERS THAT BOEING PLANS TO RESUME PRODUCTION OF 737 JETS AT A RATE OF 52 AIRCRAFT PER MONTH IN FEBRUARY 2020. IT REDUCED THE NUMBER OF 737S IT PRODUCES MONTHLY TO 42 FROM 52 WHEN MAX DELIVERIES WERE FROZEN IN APRIL, CUTTING OFF A KEY SOURCE OF CASH AND HITTING MARGINS.

BUT TIT-FOR-TAT TARIFFS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA, WHICH IS POISED TO OVERTAKE THE UNITED STATES AS THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST AVIATION MARKET IN THE NEXT DECADE, HAVE SLOWED THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND FORCED BOEING TO WALK A GEOPOLITICAL TIGHTROPE FOR MORE THAN A YEAR.  ON THE ONE HAND, BOEING HAS BEEN INCREASING ITS INDUSTRIAL FOOTPRINT IN CHINA AS IT AIMS TO INCREASE ITS SALES LEAD OVER EUROPE\u2019S AIRBUS SE IN ASIA. ON THE OTHER HAND, EXECUTIVES HAVE TAKEN PAINS TO AVOID CLASHING WITH U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WHO HAS REPEATEDLY SAID THE UNITED STATES MUST TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT AMERICAN JOBS AND TECHNOLOGY.  ANALYSTS SAY CHINA HAS BEEN SLOW TO ORDER PLANES FROM BOTH BOEING AND EUROPE\u2019S AIRBUS SE AS ITS ECONOMY WAVERS AND IT HOLDS OFF MAJOR PROCUREMENT DECISIONS PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE DISPUTE WITH THE UNITED STATES.  \u201cIT\u2019S HARD TO PREDICT WHETHER OR NOT A SUCCESSFUL DEAL WILL BE ACHIEVED,\u201d MUILENBURG SAID. \u201cCHINA\u2019S BEEN NOT ORDERING AIRPLANES OVER THE LAST YEAR, YEAR AND A HALF.

RAMP-UP AHEAD  BOEING HAS HAD TO DIVERT RESOURCES TO THE 737 MAX FROM ACROSS THE COMPANY AS IT WORKS TO WIN APPROVAL FROM AVIATION REGULATORS FOR ITS SOFTWARE UPGRADE.  IN APRIL, BOEING DROPPED PRODUCTION TO THE CURRENT RATE OF 42 AIRCRAFT PER MONTH AFTER HALTING DELIVERIES OF THE MAX TO AIRLINES, CUTTING OFF A KEY SOURCE OF CASH AND HITTING MARGINS. THE TOTAL COST OF THE 737 MAX CRISIS HAS GROWN TO MORE THAN $8 BILLION AND COUNTING.

INSIDE BOEING\u2019S 737 FACTORY AT RENTON, WASHINGTON, SOUTH OF SEATTLE, WORKERS HAVE PRE-ASSEMBLED DEDICATED TOOL KITS FOR TECHNICIANS TASKED WITH INSTALLING SOFTWARE UPDATES AND READYING OVER 500 JETS THAT HAVE SAT IDLE FOR MONTHS, INSIDERS SAID.  ACROSS THE GLOBE, BOEING TEAMS ARE HAMMERING OUT DELIVERY SCHEDULES - AND FINANCIAL TERMS - WITH AIRLINE CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CANCEL FLIGHTS, CUT ROUTES AND FLY AGING JETLINERS WHILE THEY AWAIT THE MAX\u2019S RETURN.  ALTHOUGH REGULATORS MUST STILL APPROVE THE JETS FOR FLIGHT, BOEING AND AIRLINE STAFF AND EXECUTIVES SAY THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST PLANEMAKER IS WEEKS INTO AN ELABORATE BLUEPRINT FOR PRODUCTION, MAINTENANCE AND DELIVERY THAT ONE SOURCE SAID INVOLVES 1,500 ENGINEERS - AS MANY AS IT TAKES TO DESIGN A SMALL NEW JET.  ANOTHER LIKENED THE LOGISTICS TO A NATION \u201cGOING TO WAR.\u201d  BOEING COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES CHIEF ENGINEER JOHN HAMILTON CALLED THE PREVIOUSLY UNREPORTED MOBILIZATION MORE LIKE AN ELABORATE \u201cBALLET,\u201d WHICH INCLUDES SYNCHRONIZING 680 SUPPLIERS OF EVERYTHING FROM CARBON BRAKES TO PILOT SEATBELTS.  BOEING WILL HAVE TO JUGGLE THE DELIVERY OF TWO DIFFERENT MAX CATEGORIES: SOME 250 PRODUCED SINCE THE BAN, PARKED AT VARIOUS FACILITIES IN TAIL-TO-NOSE CONFIGURATIONS THAT CONJURE THE PUZZLE GAME TETRIS; AND THOSE THAT WILL ROLL OFF THE PRODUCTION LINE POST-APPROVAL.  AIRLINES WILL MOSTLY HANDLE A THIRD CATEGORY INVOLVING THE RETURN TO SERVICE OF 387 AIRCRAFT FLOWN BEFORE THE GROUNDING, THOUGH BOEING HAS ALREADY DEPLOYED TEAMS AROUND THE WORLD TO HELP COMPANIES GET READY FOR THAT PROCESS.  BOEING\u2019S FASTEST-SELLING JET WAS GROUNDED IN MARCH AFTER FLIGHT-CONTROL SOFTWARE WAS FOUND TO HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN TWO SEPARATE CRASHES THAT KILLED 346 PEOPLE WITHIN FIVE MONTHS.  THE BAN SENT SHOCKWAVES THROUGH AVIATION, CUTTING BOEING\u2019S PROFIT AND MARGINS, WITH A COST TO BOEING SO FAR ESTIMATED AT $8 BILLION.  REDEPLOYING HUNDREDS OF IDLE 737 MAX AIRCRAFT, WHICH BRING IN AN ESTIMATED 40% OF BOEING\u2019S PRE-TAX PROFIT, SMOOTHLY IS CRUCIAL FOR THE HEALTH OF AMERICA\u2019S TOP CORPORATE EXPORTER AND THE COUNTRY\u2019S WIDER MANUFACTURING SECTOR, WHOSE RECENT LOSS OF MOMENTUM HAS TAKEN A FURTHER KNOCK FROM THE CRISIS.  BOEING RECEIVES MUCH OF ITS CASH UPON DELIVERY AND FITCH RATINGS AND MOODY\u2019S HAVE WARNED ITS \u201cSTABLE\u201d OUTLOOK MAY BE AT RISK, AS ITS PLANE DELIVERIES FALL 72% THIS YEAR.  PREPARATIONS FOR A RETURN TO SERVICE ARE FINELY TUNED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S PRESENT ASSUMPTION THAT THE 737 MAX WILL RESUME COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS IN THE OCTOBER-DECEMBER TIMEFRAME, CHIEF EXECUTIVE DENNIS MUILENBURG TOLD REUTERS IN AUGUST.  BUT THE TIMELINE IS IN THE HANDS OF DIVIDED REGULATORS AROUND THE WORLD WHO MUST APPROVE BOEING\u2019S PROPOSED SOFTWARE FIX FOR 737 MAX FLIGHT CONTROLS AND NEW TRAINING MATERIALS. EUROPEAN REGULATORS PLAN THEIR OWN TEST FLIGHTS ON THE CHANGES.  \u201cWE DON\u2019T CONTROL THAT TIMELINE,\u201d MUILENBURG SAID. \u201cWE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH THE REGULATORS AND WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS THAT TIMELINE. BUT IF THAT RETURN TO SERVICE DATE CHANGES, IT AFFECTS EVERYTHING ELSE.\u201d  BOEING HAS TOLD SUPPLIERS THAT IT EXPECTS THE PLANE TO BE FLYING IN EARLY NOVEMBER, A SENIOR INDUSTRY SOURCE SAID.  LOGISTICAL GAME PLAN  ONCE REGULATORS CERTIFY THE MAX FOR FLIGHT, BOEING WILL HAVE TO MOBILIZE HUNDREDS OF MECHANICS AND PILOTS TO BRING THE ROUGHLY 250 STORED AIRCRAFT OUT OF HIBERNATION.  AIRLINES ESTIMATE THE PROCESS - WHICH INCLUDES INSTALLING NEW SOFTWARE, CHANGING FLUIDS AND CYCLING THE ENGINES - WILL TAKE 100 TO 150 HOURS PER JET, AND MONTHS IN TOTAL FOR BOEING.  IN ONE EXAMPLE HIGHLIGHTING THE MINUTE RISKS THAT COULD UPEND MONTHS OF PLANNING, A TEAM OF EMPLOYEES IS ANALYZING YEARS OF DATA ON DECEMBER SNOWFALL AT AN AIRPORT IN RURAL MOSES LAKE, WASHINGTON - WHERE BOEING HAS PARKED SOME 100 JETS - TO PREDICT DEMAND FOR AIRCRAFT ANTI-FREEZE AND RUNWAY PERFORMANCE.  THE MAINTENANCE PROCESS WILL BE FOLLOWED SEVERAL DAYS OF TEST FLIGHTS AS PART OF A STANDARD CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE PERIOD, BUT ANOTHER CHALLENGE IS FINDING ENOUGH PILOTS TO WORK THROUGH THE BACKLOG.  AS A RESULT, BOEING IS EXPLORING A DEAL FOR TEMPORARY PILOTS WITH ISLE OF MAN-BASED AIRCREW AND TRAINING PROVIDER CCL AVIATION TO SUPPLEMENT ITS STAFF PILOTS, ONE PERSON WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE MATTER SAID.  \u201cGIVEN THE BACKLOG OF STORED AIRCRAFT, THAT CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE PROCESS COULD DRAG OUT,\u201d SAID SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO CHIEF REVENUE OFFICER ANDREW WATTERSON.  UNCERTAIN AVIATION MARKET  IT\u2019S NOT CLEAR WHICH CUSTOMERS WILL RECEIVE DELIVERIES FIRST. MUCH WILL DEPEND ON HOW QUICKLY OTHER GLOBAL REGULATORS WHO HAVE PROMISED THEIR OWN SCRUTINY FOLLOW THE U.S. LEAD.  SOME, LIKE UNITED AIRLINES, HAVE SAID THEY WANT THE JETS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, BUT OTHERS MAY USE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADJUST DELIVERIES. WHILE AIRLINES HAD BEEN EAGER TO ADD THE FUEL-SAVING MODELS AHEAD OF THE PEAK NORTHERN HEMISPHERE SUMMER, FEWER TEND TO ADD CAPACITY IN THE QUIETER MONTH OF NOVEMBER.  THE EVENTUAL MAX RETURN WILL ALSO TEST AN INCREASINGLY FRAGILE AVIATION MARKET. TRAFFIC GROWTH HAS SLIPPED SINCE THE GROUNDING PARTLY AS A RESULT OF GLOBAL TRADE TENSIONS, ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION.  MUILENBURG HAS PLAYED DOWN CONCERNS ABOUT AIRLINE DEMAND, TELLING A CONFERENCE THIS WEEK THAT THE MARKET REMAINS ROBUST.  BUT OF 250 STORED JETS, ABOUT A DOZEN ARE BOUND FOR LESSORS THAT HAVE YET TO PLACE THEM WITH AIRLINES, OR WERE BUILT FOR NOW-BANKRUPT CARRIERS LIKE JET AIRWAYS, INDUSTRY SOURCES SAID.

A SPOKESMAN FOR AIR CANADA SAID THE AIRLINE WAS NOT ABLE TO USE SIMILAR 737S WITHIN ITS FLEET \u201cTO MAINTAIN CHECK PILOT AUTHORITY IN ALIGNMENT WITH (CANADIAN AVIATION REGULATIONS)\u201d.  \u201cSO WE ARE UTILIZING THE 737 MAX DURING PLANNED MAINTENANCE MOVEMENTS TO MAINTAIN QUALIFICATION.\u201d  BETWEEN AUG 28 AND SEPT 8 THE AIR CANADA MAX PLANE CRISS-CROSSED BETWEEN MONTREAL, VAL D\u2019OR, QUEBEC AND NORTH BAY, ONTARIO, DATA FROM TRACKING WEBSITE FLIGHTRADAR24 SHOWS.  THEN LAST WEEK, IT WAS FLOWN TO PINAL AIRPARK IN ARIZONA TO BE PARKED IN A DESERT STORAGE SITE.  ALTHOUGH UNUSUAL AFTER THE GROUNDING IMPOSED WORLDWIDE IN MARCH AMID CONCERNS OVER AN ANTI-STALL SYSTEM, THE FLIGHTS HIGHLIGHT GROWING PRESSURES FACING SOME AIRLINES AS THEY PREPARE FOR THE RETURN TO SERVICE OF THE 400-PLANE BOEING FLEET.  THE PLANES HAVE BEEN SITTING IDLE SINCE MARCH FOLLOWING TWO CRASHES IN THE SPACE OF FIVE MONTHS.  FOR AIRLINES LIKE AIR CANADA, WHICH DID NOT HAVE EARLIER VERSIONS OF BOEING 737S IN THEIR FLEETS, THIS HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE SURE PILOTS CAN DEMONSTRATE THE SKILLS REQUIRED TO RETAIN THEIR LICENSES.  AS NORTH AMERICA\u2019S SOLE MAX OPERATOR WHICH HAD NOT FLOWN THE EARLIER 737NG, AIR CANADA CANNOT USE THAT MODEL TO MAINTAIN THE QUALIFICATIONS OF ITS CHECK OR TRAINER PILOTS, THE COMPANY SAID.  SO REGULATOR TRANSPORT CANADA AUTHORIZED A SELECT GROUP OF AIR CANADA\u2019S CHECK PILOTS TO FLY THE GROUNDED JET, WHICH WAS ALSO CONDUCTING MAINTENANCE FLIGHTS, THE AIRLINE SAID.  ALL THE JETS HAVE THE SAME CONTROL SOFTWARE SUSPECTED OF CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENTS, WHICH BOEING IS NOW IN THE PROCESS OF REVISING TO SMOOTH ITS IMPACT. HOWEVER, SOME PILOTS HAVE SAID EXISTING PROCEDURES CAN PREVENT SIMILAR ACCIDENTS.  BOEING DECLINED TO COMMENT.  MARKET BATTLE  TRANSPORT CANADA SAID IN AN EMAIL THAT IT AUTHORIZED THE FLIGHTS \u201cBECAUSE THE CARRIER DOES NOT OPERATE THE BOEING 737 NG AIRCRAFT, BUT THE PILOTS STILL NEED TO MAINTAIN CURRENCY.\u201d  HOWEVER, ONE U.S. CARRIER QUESTIONED BY REUTERS SAID SUCH FLIGHTS WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE PILOT TRAINING WAS NOT INCLUDED IN A LIST OF EXEMPTIONS TO THE BAN ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION.  \u201cPILOT CURRENCY ISN\u2019T A LISTED EXEMPTION IN THE U.S. ORDER,\u201d AN FAA SPOKESWOMAN CONFIRMED.  NORTH AMERICAN MAX OPERATORS, INCLUDING SOUTHWEST AIRLINES (LUV.N), AMERICAN AIRLINES (AAL.O), UNITED AIRLINES (UAL.O) AND CANADA\u2019S WESTJET AIRLINES WJA.TO, SAID THEY WOULD ONLY MOVE THEIR MAX JETS FOR MAINTENANCE AND STORAGE PURPOSES.  AIR CANADA\u2019S POSITION AS A NEWLY-CONVERTED 737 OPERATOR FOLLOWS A SEVEN-YEAR BATTLE BETWEEN BOEING AND AIRBUS OVER THE INTRODUCTION OF AIRPLANES OFFERING BOLD NEW FUEL SAVINGS.  THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MAX, AN UPGRADE OF EARLIER 737 MODELS WITH ADVANCED NEW ENGINES, COINCIDED WITH A BITTER CONTEST FOR MARKET SHARE BETWEEN BOEING AND EUROPE\u2019S AIRBUS (AIR.PA), WHICH WAS OFFERING ITS SIMILAR A320NEO.  THE FEUD SAW BOTH PLANEMAKERS USE THE TRANSITION TO A NEW GENERATION OF JETS TO TRY TO POACH EACH OTHER\u2019S CUSTOMERS, AND TRADERS SAID AIR CANADA\u2019S 2013 DECISION TO SWITCH FROM AIRBUS\u2019S A320 FAMILY TO BOEING\u2019S 737 MAX STOOD OUT AS A MAJOR DEFECTION.  NOW, THE DECISION TO SWITCH SUPPLIERS POTENTIALLY WEIGHS ON SOME OF THOSE SAME AIRLINES AS THEY COPE WITHOUT A 737 FLEET.

REUTERS/LINDSEY WASSON/FILE PHOTO  DICKSON MET WITH BOEING EXECUTIVES IN RENTON, WASHINGTON ON THURSDAY AND TESTED REVISED SOFTWARE IN A SIMULATOR. NEXT WEEK, HE WILL MEET WITH AROUND 50 AVIATION SAFETY REGULATORS IN MONTREAL TO DISCUSS THE STATUS OF THE PLANE, WHICH HAS BEEN GROUNDED WORLDWIDE SINCE MARCH IN THE AFTERMATH OF TWO FATAL CRASHES.  THE FAA HAS BEEN REVIEWING PROPOSED SOFTWARE AND TRAINING CHANGES FROM BOEING CO (BA.N) FOR MONTHS AND IT REMAINS UNCERTAIN WHEN BOEING WILL CONDUCT A CERTIFICATION TEST FLIGHT, A STEP NEEDED BEFORE ITS BEST-SELLING PLANE CAN FLY AGAIN.  IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WITH REUTERS, DICKSON LAID OUT A SERIES OF STEPS THAT MUST HAPPEN BEFORE THE CERTIFICATION TEST FLIGHT, ADDING IT SHOULD THEN TAKE ABOUT ANOTHER MONTH BEFORE THE FAA COULD ALLOW FLIGHTS TO RESUME ABSENT UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES.  \u201cI AM NOT GOING TO SIGN OFF ON THE PLANE UNTIL I AM PERSONALLY SATISFIED,\u201d HE SAID.  SOME GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD REUTERS THEY DO NOT BELIEVE BOEING WILL CONDUCT THE CERTIFICATION FLIGHT UNTIL AT LEAST MID-OCTOBER. ASKED IF THERE ARE AT LEAST SEVERAL WEEKS OF WORK TO BE DONE BEFORE THAT FLIGHT CAN OCCUR, DICKSON SAID HE THOUGHT THAT WAS A \u201cFAIR STATEMENT,\u201d BUT DID NOT WANT TO SET A SPECIFIC DATE.  ASKED ABOUT REPORTS THAT THE FAA HAS AT TIMES BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH A LACK OF INFORMATION FROM BOEING, DICKSON SAID HE IS SATISFIED THAT BOEING HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE TO HIM AND ADDED THE FAA HAD MADE CLEAR WHAT IT EXPECTED.  \u201cWE\u2019VE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION AND NOT PIECEMEAL DOCUMENTATION,\u201d DICKSON SAID.  \u201cIT\u2019S REALLY BETTER TO BE VERY METHODICAL AND VERY DETAILED RATHER THAN TRY TO RUSH A PARTIALLY COMPLETED PRODUCT AND THEN SAY, \u2018WE\u2019LL GET BACK TO YOU WITH THE REST OF IT.\u2019\u201d  BOEING HAS REPEATEDLY SAID IT HOPES TO RESUME FLIGHTS EARLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. THE COMPANY REITERATED THURSDAY IT REMAINS \u201cCOMMITTED TO WORKING COLLABORATIVELY\u201d WITH THE FAA AND OTHER REGULATORS.  FAA STILL NEEDS TO SEE BOEING\u2019S \u201cFINAL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION\u201d - A \u201c500-ISH PAGE DOCUMENT THAT HAS THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM AND THE CHANGES THAT THEY HAVE MADE,\u201d DICKSON SAID, ADDING THAT THE SOFTWARE CHANGES MUST BE IN A \u201cPRE-PRODUCTION\u201d CODE AND NOT A \u201cBETA VERSION\u201d.  \u201cWE NEED TO SEE THAT LEVEL OF REFINEMENT AND THERE HAS BEEN A GOOD BIT OF BACK AND FORTH AND SOME CONSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS,\u201d HE SAID.  \u201cUNTIL IT IS LOCKED DOWN, WE\u2019VE GOT TO GO MAKE SURE THAT THERE AREN\u2019T ANY NEW FAULT TREES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED THAT NEED TO BE MITIGATED.\u201d  ONCE THE SYSTEM DESCRIPTION IS COMPLETED, THE FAA WILL WORK WITH BOEING TO DEVELOP THE \u201cINTEGRATED SYSTEM SAFETY ANALYSIS\u201d - A STEP THAT WILL TAKE A FEW DAYS.

THE CLOSED-DOOR BRIEFING, ON THE EVE OF A UNITED NATIONS AVIATION ASSEMBLY IN MONTREAL, WILL PUT REPRESENTATIVES FROM ABOUT 50 NATIONS IN THE SAME ROOM, TO SWAP CONCERNS ABOUT BOEING CO\u2019S PROPOSED SOFTWARE FIXES AND NEW PILOT TRAINING.  NEW FAA ADMINISTRATOR STEVE DICKSON DOWNPLAYED THE CHANCES OF A CONSENSUS BREAKTHROUGH, TELLING REUTERS LAST WEEK THAT THE MEETING WAS MORE \u201cTO PROVIDE REGULATORS WITH THE LATEST INFORMATION.\u201d  THE REPRESENTATIVES ARE DRAWN FROM COUNTRIES WITH AIRLINES THAT FLY THAT MAX AND THOSE THAT WILL HAVE FLIGHTS OF THE AIRCRAFT LANDING, HE SAID.  BOEING\u2019S BEST-SELLING JET WAS GROUNDED GLOBALLY IN MARCH, DAYS AFTER THE CRASH OF AN ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT THAT FOLLOWED A SIMILAR LION AIR DISASTER IN INDONESIA IN OCTOBER. A TOTAL OF 346 PEOPLE DIED IN THE TWO CRASHES.  THE U.S. MANUFACTURER HAS SPENT MONTHS WORKING TO UPDATE CRITICAL FLIGHT CONTROL SOFTWARE AT THE CENTER OF BOTH CRASHES, IN HOPES OF WINNING FAA APPROVAL FOR THE PLANES TO FLY AGAIN IN THE UNITED STATES BETWEEN OCTOBER AND DECEMBER.  AIRLINES HAVE URGED REGULATORS TO COORDINATE ON THE SOFTWARE CHANGES IN A BID TO AVOID DAMAGING SPLITS OVER SAFETY, BUT SOME COUNTRIES HAVE ALREADY VOWED TO RUN THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT VALIDATION STUDIES BEFORE RESTORING FLIGHTS.  THE EUROPEAN UNION AVIATION SAFETY AGENCY (EASA), WHICH IS DOING ITS OWN EXAMINATION OF THE 737 MAX DESIGN, SAID RECENTLY THERE WAS STILL NO APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO ISSUES WITH THE INTEGRITY OF THE AIRCRAFT\u2019S ANGLE OF ATTACK SYSTEM.  IN BOTH CRASHES, ERRONEOUS DATA TO ONE OF THE ANGLE OF ATTACK SENSORS LED TO THE ACTIVATION OF AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM THAT REPEATEDLY PUSHED DOWN THE PLANE\u2019S NOSE.  PAUL NJOROGE, WHO LOST HIS WIFE, THREE CHILDREN AND MOTHER-IN-LAW IN THE ETHIOPIAN CRASH, AND CHRIS MOORE, WHO LOST HIS DAUGHTER, PLAN TO HOLD PICTURES OF VICTIMS OUTSIDE THE MEETING.  THE FAA TURNED DOWN THEIR REQUEST TO ATTEND THE BRIEFING BUT DICKSON AGREED TO MEET THE TWO MEN BEFOREHAND, SAID NADIA MILLERON, WHOSE DAUGHTER, SAMYA STUMO, ALSO DIED IN THE ETHIOPIAN CRASH.  THE FAA IS STILL REVIEWING THE SOFTWARE UPDATE AND AWAITING A DOCUMENT LONGER THAN 500 PAGES FROM BOEING DETAILING THE FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM\u2019S ARCHITECTURE AND CHANGES, DICKSON SAID LAST WEEK.  THE AGENCY ALSO WANTS INPUT FROM INTERNATIONAL REGULATORS EASA, CANADA AND BRAZIL BEFORE IT CONDUCTS THE CERTIFICATION TEST FLIGHT, A KEY STEP BEFORE FINAL APPROVAL.  THE 737 MAX GROUNDING IS NOT ON THE AGENDA OF THE ASSEMBLY OF THE INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION ORGANIZATION, TO RUN FROM SEPT. 24 TO OCT. 4, BUT REGULATORS WILL BE ANXIOUS TO AVOID DIVISIONS OVER ACTIONS NEEDED TO RESTORE THE JET TO SERVICE.

THE CRASHES LED TO THE PLANE\u2019S GROUNDING AND RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FAA\u2019S CERTIFICATION OF THE NEW AIRCRAFT.

THE SAFETY BOARD ALSO SAID THE FAA SHOULD DEVELOP \u201cROBUST TOOLS AND METHODS\u201d TO VALIDATE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PILOT RESPONSE.  BOEING IS REVISING THE 737 MAX SOFTWARE TO REQUIRE THE MCAS SYSTEM TO RECEIVE INPUT FROM BOTH AOA SENSORS, AND HAS ADDED ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS.  THE REPORT CAME A DAY AFTER BOEING\u2019S BOARD SAID IT HAD CREATED A NEW PERMANENT SAFETY COMMITTEE TO OVERSEE DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND OPERATION OF ITS AIRCRAFT AND SERVICES.  THE NTSB SAID IT WAS NOT ANALYZING PILOT ACTIONS IN THE TWO FATAL CRASHES AND THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE NOT A REFLECTION ON THE PILOTS IN THOSE CRASHES.  BOEING\u2019S 737 MAX SAFETY SYSTEM ASSESSMENTS ASSUMED \u201cIMMEDIATE AND APPROPRIATE PILOT CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO UNCOMMANDED FLIGHT CONTROL INPUTS, FROM SYSTEMS SUCH AS MCAS,\u201d THE NTSB SAID. IT SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HOW OTHER POSSIBLE FLIGHT DECK ALERTS AND OTHER FACTORS COULD IMPACT PILOTS\u2019 DECISION MAKING AND MAKES CHANGES AS WARRANTED, THE AGENCY ADDED.  THE NTSB SAID IT WANTS THE FAA TO REQUIRE THE SAME ASSESSMENT FOR ALL OTHER AIRPLANE MANUFACTURERS AND BELIEVES OTHER INTERNATIONAL REGULATORS THAT CERTIFY AIRPLANES SHOULD CONSIDER MAKING THE SAME CHANGES.

REUTERS/LINDSEY WASSON/FILE PHOTO  BOEING CO\u2019S FASTEST-SELLING JETLINER, THE 737 MAX, WAS GROUNDED WORLDWIDE IN MARCH AFTER TWO FATAL CRASHES THAT KILLED A TOTAL OF 346 PEOPLE WITHIN FIVE MONTHS.  PILOT OVERLOAD APPEARS TO HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN BOTH CRASHES, IN WHICH CREWS STRUGGLED TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE WHILE A NEW FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM REPEATEDLY PUSHED THE NOSE DOWN AMID A SERIES OF OTHER AUDIO AND SENSORY ALARMS AND ALERTS.  \u201cWHAT WE NEED TO DO IS ENSURE THAT THE AIRCREW IN THE MAX ARE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT ENVIRONMENT,\u201d ROBINSON SAID IN AN INTERVIEW WITH REUTERS.  TRANSPORT CANADA IS AMONG A CORE GROUP OF REGULATORS THAT IS EVALUATING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE 737 MAX TO FLY AGAIN AFTER A SEVEN-MONTH GROUNDING.  IT HAS BEEN CONVENING WEEKLY BY PHONE, VIDEO CONFERENCES OR FACE-TO-FACE WITH THE U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION AND ITS COUNTERPARTS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND BRAZIL, ROBINSON SAID.  THEIR DECISIONS COULD LEAD TO SWEEPING CHANGES TO PILOT FLIGHT OPERATING MANUALS AND CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION AND EVEN MANDATES FOR COSTLY SIMULATOR TRAINING, INDUSTRY SOURCES HAVE SAID.  HOWEVER, NO TRAINING DECISIONS CAN BE MADE UNTIL BOEING SUBMITS SOFTWARE UPDATES TO THE FAA FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL, ROBINSON SAID.  TRANSPORT CANADA IS CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AVIATION SAFETY AGENCY ON RETURN TO SERVICE DEMANDS AND HAS ALSO RAISED QUESTIONS OVER THE ARCHITECTURE BEHIND THE 737 MAX\u2019S ANGLE OF ATTACK SYSTEM.  \u201cWE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR A SOLUTION PROPOSED BY THE MANUFACTURER AND THE FAA ON THAT AREA,\u201d HE SAID.  STILL, CANADA\u2019S GOAL IS FOR THE MAX TO RETURN IN COUNTRIES ACROSS THE GLOBE SIMULTANEOUSLY, OR AT LEAST IN CLOSE SUCCESSION.  \u201cIT\u2019S NOT A NECESSITY, BUT IT\u2019S A GOAL,\u201d ROBINSON SAID.  PILOT WORKLOAD  A STARTLE OR SURPRISE IN THE COCKPIT CAN ENDANGER A PILOT\u2019S ABILITY TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT AND WAS SAID TO PLAY A ROLE IN EARLIER AIR CRASHES LIKE AIR FRANCE FLIGHT 447 IN 2009.  THE SAME YEAR, CHESLEY \u201cSULLY\u201d SULLENBERGER SAFELY LANDED A US AIRWAYS FLIGHT ON THE HUDSON RIVER IN NEW YORK AFTER A BIRD STRIKE DISABLED THE ENGINES. HE TOLD LAWMAKERS IN JUNE THAT THE 737 MAX CREW COULD HAVE BEEN CONFUSED AS THEY STRUGGLED TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT.  \u201cI CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND THAT THE STARTLE FACTOR IS REAL AND IT\u2019S HUGE. IT ABSOLUTELY INTERFERES WITH ONE\u2019S ABILITY TO QUICKLY ANALYZE THE CRISIS AND TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION,\u201d SULLENBERGER SAID.  UNDER NEW SIMULATOR SCENARIOS, 737 MAX PILOTS WORLDWIDE MAY BE TRAINED ON RUNAWAY STABILIZER, A LOSS OF CONTROL THAT WAS TRIGGERED IN BOTH 737 MAX CRASHES, COUPLED WITH SOME KIND OF UNEXPECTED MALFUNCTION.  \u201cTHE ONLY WAY TO EFFECTIVELY DEAL WITH THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL REACTIONS OF \u2018STARTLE EFFECT\u2019 IS TO HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN EXPOSED TO IT,\u201d SAID CAPTAIN LARRY ROONEY, PRESIDENT OF THE COALITION OF AIRLINE PILOTS ASSOCIATIONS.  THE GOAL OF INTRODUCING STARTLES IS TO TEACH PILOTS HOW TO RESPOND TO \u201cFIGHT, FLIGHT OR FREEZE\u201d INSTINCTS IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE EFFECTS ARE NOT LIFE THREATENING, SAID ROONEY. THE ONLY WAY TO TRAIN FOR STARTLE IS IN A SIMULATOR OR IN REAL LIFE.  BOEING CEO DENNIS MUILENBURG ON WEDNESDAY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT BOEING\u2019S FLIGHT CONTROL SOFTWARE, ACTIVATED OFF FAULTY DATA FROM A KEY AIRFLOW SENSOR, CONTRIBUTED TO A BROADER CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT CREATED MORE WORKLOAD FOR THE PILOTS IN 737 MAX CRASHES.  THE PLANEMAKER, WHICH IS TARGETING A 737 MAX RETURN TO SERVICE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, HAS STARTED SHOWING PILOTS AND REGULATORS ITS PROPOSED SOFTWARE UPDATE AND TRAINING PROGRAM AT INFORMATION SESSIONS IN MIAMI, LONDON, ISTANBUL, SHANGHAI AND SINGAPORE SCHEDULED TO RUN THROUGH MID-OCTOBER.", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2019-10-04T00:00:00", "key": "20191004BA", "labelr0": 0.9756228666648736, "labelr1": 0.22358264572798286, "labelr2": -0.6480055239815152, "labelr3": 0.2298850574712528, "labelr4": -1.0561126520162096, "pos": 0.08900000000000001, "neg": 0.13699999999999998, "compound": -0.2023, "0_day_return": 0.9756228666648824, "1_day_return": 0.22358264572799325, "2_day_return": -0.4258717061485062, "3_day_return": -0.19696566409368446, "4_day_return": -1.2509981368112657, "label": 1, "return": -0.004478294773803964, "excess_return": 0.2280609405017972, "count_of_word": 665, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.3983975, "prof1": 0.6016024999999999, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5010617627438398, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4989382372561601, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.3983975, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.6016024999999999, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.53092575, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.46907425, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.47594598, "tr_prof1": 0.52405405, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.45020175, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.5497983, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5696215, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.4303785, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.44920743, "headline_prof21": 0.5507926, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.30063105, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.69936895, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.46299765, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.5370024, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.5351446999999999, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.46485534, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 0.22358264572799325, "returnpredvader": -0.22358264572799325, "returnpredsgd": -0.22358264572799325, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9999975005369028, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9977641735427201, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9999975005369028, "cumreturn1b": 1.42155420886444, "cumreturn1d": 0.8622994384284364, "cumreturn1e": 1.3593856974114664, "cumreturndow": 1.1606871045445546, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1299380601988678}, {"Unnamed: 0": 12674, "Unnamed: 0.1": 12674, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 12674, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 12674, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 12674, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 12674, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12674, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12674, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12674, "level_0": 12674, "index": 12674, "text": "FILE PHOTO: AN AERIAL PHOTO SHOWS BOEING 737 MAX AIRCRAFT AT BOEING FACILITIES AT THE GRANT COUNTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN MOSES LAKE, WASHINGTON, SEPTEMBER 16, 2019.

FILE PHOTO: AN AERIAL PHOTO SHOWS BOEING 737 MAX AIRCRAFT AT BOEING FACILITIES AT THE GRANT COUNTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN MOSES LAKE, WASHINGTON, SEPTEMBER 16, 2019. REUTERS/LINDSEY WASSON  THE LONG-STANDING PRACTICE OF DELEGATING CERTIFICATION TASKS TO AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS HAS COME UNDER CRITICISM FROM LAWMAKERS AND OTHERS AFTER THE TWO CRASHES IN OCTOBER 2018 IN INDONESIA AND MARCH 2019 IN ETHIOPIA, WHICH KILLED 346 PEOPLE.  THE REPORT, REPORTED BY REUTERS BEFORE ITS PUBLIC RELEASE LATE WEDNESDAY, SAID THE FAA FACES A \u201cSIGNIFICANT OVERSIGHT CHALLENGE\u201d TO ENSURE THAT COMPANIES CONDUCTING THOSE TASKS \u201cMAINTAIN HIGH STANDARDS AND COMPLY WITH FAA SAFETY REGULATIONS.\u201d  THE REPORT SAID THAT BY MARCH 2020, THE FAA PLANS TO INTRODUCE \u201cA NEW PROCESS THAT REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ITS APPROACH TO OVERSEEING\u201d AIRCRAFT DESIGNATION EFFORTS.  THE FAA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY COMMENT.  U.S. TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT SECRETARY ELAINE CHAO IN A AUG. 12 MEMO TO FAA ADMINISTRATOR STEVE DICKSON MADE PUBLIC WEDNESDAY SAID THE CRASHES \u201cPROMPTED IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CERTIFICATION OF THE 737 MAX, THE FAA\u2019S AIRCRAFT CERTIFICATION AND OVERSIGHT PROCESSES GENERALLY AND THE RECEPTIVENESS OF FAA\u2019S LEADERSHIP TO CRITICAL FEEDBACK FROM WITHIN ITS RANKS.\u201d  CHAO IN AUGUST ORDERED DICKSON TO ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS AND SAID \u201cCONTINUED EXCELLENCE REQUIRES ROOTING OUT PROBLEMS AND EMBRACING OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT.\u201d  DICKSON SAID TUESDAY THAT THE FAA AND AIRPLANE MANUFACTURERS NEED TO BETTER SCRUTINIZE THE INTERFACE BETWEEN PILOTS AND MACHINES. HE ADDED THE FAA AND MANUFACTURERS MUST IMPROVE PROCESSES TO ENSURE \u201cWE DON\u2019T HAVE FRAGMENTED COMMUNICATIONS\u201d ON CERTIFICATION.  THE 58-PAGE REPORT ALSO LAID OUT OTHER MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES THE FAA AND TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT FACE, INCLUDING CYBERSECURITY, AIRSPACE MODERNIZATION, INTEGRATING DRONES INTO THE AIR SPACE, AIR CARRIER SAFETY OVERSIGHT AND PREPARING FOR EMERGING VEHICLE AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGIES.  THE REPORT ADDED THAT \u201cTHE NEW PROCESS WILL INCLUDE IDENTIFYING CRITICAL SYSTEM ELEMENTS AND DEVELOPING NEW EVALUATION CRITERIA. WHILE REVAMPING FAA\u2019S OVERSIGHT PROCESS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT STEP, CONTINUED MANAGEMENT ATTENTION WILL BE KEY TO ENSURE THE AGENCY IDENTIFIES AND MONITORS THE HIGHEST-RISK AND SAFETY-CRITICAL AREAS OF AIRCRAFT CERTIFICATION.\u201d  CONGRESS IS MULLING CHANGES TO HOW THE FAA DELEGATES SOME CERTIFICATION TASKS TO MANUFACTURERS FOR NEW AIRPLANES. IN THE 737 MAX CERTIFICATION IT INITIALLY DELEGATED 40% OF THE WORK TO BOEING AND LATER SHIFTED MORE WORK TO BOEING, INCLUDING WORK ON A KEY SAFETY SYSTEM TIED TO BOTH DEADLY CRASHES KNOWN AS MCAS.  THE INSPECTOR GENERAL\u2019S OFFICE HAS AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO THE ACTIVITIES THAT RESULTED IN THE CERTIFICATION OF THE BOEING 737 MAX THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED UNTIL NEXT YEAR.  THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT IN A LETTER TO CONGRESS WEDNESDAY SAID IT HAD TURNED OVER 33,000 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS ON THE 737 MAX, INCLUDING 5,000 PAGES OF EMAILS, AND LET CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS INTERVIEW NUMEROUS FAA EMPLOYEES. IT DENIED THAT DOCUMENTS FROM A FORMER BOEING PILOT MADE PUBLIC FRIDAY WERE EVIDENCE OF \u201cCOZINESS\u201d BETWEEN THE FAA AND MANUFACTURER.  A REPORT FROM THE JOINT AUTHORITIES TECHNICAL REVIEW (JATR), A PANEL OF INTERNATIONAL REGULATORS COMMISSIONED BY THE FAA AND RELEASED EARLIER THIS MONTH, FAULTED THE REVIEW OF MCAS AND BOEING FOR ASSUMPTIONS IT MADE IN DESIGNING THE AIRPLANE.  THE JATR RECOMMENDATIONS SAID THE FAA\u2019S LONGSTANDING PRACTICE OF DELEGATING \u201cA HIGH LEVEL\u201d OF CERTIFICATION TASKS TO MANUFACTURERS, SUCH AS BOEING, NEEDS SIGNIFICANT REFORM TO ENSURE ADEQUATE SAFETY OVERSIGHT. IT ALSO QUESTIONED THE LIMITED FAA STAFFING OF OVERSIGHT AND QUALIFICATIONS OF SOME FAA EMPLOYEES OVERSEEING BOEING AND SAID THERE WERE SIGNS SOME BOEING EMPLOYEES CONDUCTING FAA TASKS REPORTED FEELING \u201cUNDUE PRESSURE.\u201d", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2019-10-23T00:00:00", "key": "20191023BA", "labelr0": 1.0385756676557862, "labelr1": 1.1894273127753339, "labelr2": -1.3699027717312515, "labelr3": 0.3089780184209785, "labelr4": 2.3615348509739533, "pos": 0.379, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.6705, "0_day_return": 1.0385756676557945, "1_day_return": 1.1894273127753374, "2_day_return": -0.19676945668134493, "3_day_return": 0.11160058737151868, "4_day_return": 2.4757709251101323, "label": 1, "return": 0.0019204461816167387, "excess_return": 1.1875068665937207, "count_of_word": 607, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.38534525, "prof1": 0.6146548000000001, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4733892612141186, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5266107387858814, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.38534525, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.6146548000000001, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.42236015, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.5776399, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5231150999999999, "tr_prof1": 0.47688484, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5255479999999999, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.474452, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.4712879, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.52871215, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.6178331, "headline_prof21": 0.38216695, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.43620113, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5637989000000001, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.38869852, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.6113014, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.6743503000000001, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.32564962, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": -1.1894273127753374, "returnpredvader": 1.1894273127753374, "returnpredsgd": 1.1894273127753374, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0020219711778122, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9981688970105796, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0085900330122228, "cumreturn1b": 1.385555243524359, "cumreturn1d": 0.9478026385710262, "cumreturn1e": 1.2864606092287876, "cumreturndow": 1.1889263209817982, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1439143981669304}, {"Unnamed: 0": 13613, "Unnamed: 0.1": 13613, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 13613, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 13613, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 13613, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 13613, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13613, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13613, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13613, "level_0": 13613, "index": 13613, "text": "(REUTERS) - AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC (AAL.O) AND SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO (LUV.N) POSTED QUARTERLY PROFIT INCREASES ON THURSDAY THANKS TO STRONG U.S. TRAVEL DEMAND EVEN AS THE TWO CARRIERS POINTED TO A RISING COST IMPACT FROM THE CONTINUED GROUNDING OF THE BOEING 737 MAX.

THAT HAS LED TO MORE THAN 100 DAILY FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS AT BOTH AIRLINES INTO EARLY NEXT YEAR AND CONSTRICTED THEIR GROWTH PLANS, WHILE RIVALS LIKE DELTA AIR LINES INC (DAL.N) PICK UP MARKET SHARE.  \u201cWE\u2019RE TEMPORARILY LOSING SOME SHARE, WHICH WE DON\u2019T LIKE,\u201d SOUTHWEST CHIEF EXECUTIVE GARY KELLY TOLD ANALYSTS ON A CONFERENCE CALL.  THE LOW-COST CARRIER IS PREPARING FOR SOME \u201cUNEASINESS\u201d FROM A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS IN THE EARLY DAYS OF A 737 MAX RETURN, THE TIMING OF WHICH REMAINS UNCERTAIN, BUT KELLY SAID THE MAJORITY OF ITS CUSTOMERS HAD INDICATED THEY WOULD NOT CHANGE THEIR FLYING BEHAVIOR BASED ON AIRCRAFT TYPE.  SOUTHWEST\u2019S NET INCOME ROSE TO $659 MILLION, OR $1.23 PER SHARE, IN THE THIRD QUARTER FROM $615 MILLION, OR $1.08 PER SHARE, A YEAR EARLIER ON A 1.1% RISE IN OPERATING REVENUE TO $5.64 BILLION.  NET INCOME AT AMERICAN ROSE TO $425 MILLION, OR 96 CENTS PER SHARE, FROM $372 MILLION, OR 81 CENTS PER SHARE, A YEAR EARLIER. TOTAL OPERATING REVENUE ROSE 3% TO $11.91 BILLION.  AMERICAN SHARES ROSE 3.8% TO $29.375 AND SOUTHWEST SHARES WERE UP 5.2% AT $56.02.  COST HIT  WITH 737 MAX JETS STILL PARKED PENDING BOEING\u2019S SOFTWARE UPDATES AND REGULATORY APPROVAL, AIRLINES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CONTINUALLY REVISE THEIR FLYING SCHEDULES AND GROWTH PLANS.  AMERICAN TRIMMED THE TOP END OF ITS ADJUSTED 2019 FORECAST TO $5.50 PER SHARE VERSUS ITS PREVIOUS FORECAST RANGE OF $4.50 TO $6 PER SHARE AND RAISED THE ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO THE MAX GROUNDING TO $540 MILLION FOR THE YEAR FROM $400 MILLION.  SOUTHWEST DID NOT PROVIDE A FULL-YEAR PROFIT FORECAST BUT SAID IT TOOK A $210 MILLION HIT TO OPERATING INCOME IN THE QUARTER FROM THE MAX SAFETY BAN, BRINGING THE NINE-MONTH TOTAL TO AN ESTIMATED $435 MILLION.  BOEING, WHICH HAS FACED INCREASING CONCERNS IN THE PAST WEEK OVER HOW THE MAX WAS DEVELOPED AND CERTIFIED, HAS SET ASIDE $5.6 BILLION IN PART TO COVER POTENTIAL PAYMENTS TO CUSTOMERS FOR MAX-RELATED DAMAGES.

REUTERS/LINDSEY WASSON/FILE PHOTO  BOEING HAS SAID IT IS TARGETING U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION APPROVAL FOR THE JET\u2019S RETURN TO SERVICE IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE END OF THE YEAR, FOLLOWING CHANGES TO TRAINING AND COCKPIT SOFTWARE AT THE CENTER OF BOTH CRASHES.  THAT TIMEFRAME MAY DIFFER IN OTHER COUNTRIES.  FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE KEY STEPS THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE THE 737 MAX RETURNS TO THE SKIES.  SOFTWARE UPDATES AND FLIGHT TESTS  BOEING, WHICH HAS BEEN UPDATING FLIGHT-CONTROL SOFTWARE, LAST WEEK GAVE THE FAA A \u201cFINAL SOFTWARE LOAD\u201d AND \u201cCOMPLETE SYSTEM DESCRIPTION\u201d OF REVISIONS TO THE PLANE THAT ARE MEANT TO ADD LAYERS OF PROTECTION.  THE NEXT STEP IS TO COMPLETE PILOT WORKLOAD MANAGEMENT TESTING AND TO HAVE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PILOTS CONDUCT SCENARIOS TO DETERMINE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS BEFORE A KEY CERTIFICATION TEST FLIGHT, FAA ADMINISTRATOR STEVE DICKSON SAID.  THE FAA HAS SAID IT WILL NEED ABOUT 30 DAYS FROM THE TIME THE CERTIFICATION FLIGHT IS COMPLETED BEFORE IT DECIDES WHETHER TO ALLOW FLIGHTS TO RESUME.  BOEING HAS RUN OVER 800 TEST AND PRODUCTION FLIGHTS WITH THE NEW SOFTWARE TOTALING OVER 1,500 HOURS, AND EARLIER THIS MONTH SAID IT SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCTED A DRY-RUN OF A CERTIFICATION FLIGHT TEST.  PILOT TRAINING  AN INTERNATIONAL JOINT OPERATIONAL EVALUATION BOARD MUST SUBMIT RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE FAA\u2019S FLIGHT STANDARDS BOARD (FSB), WHICH DETERMINES U.S. PILOT-TRAINING REQUIREMENTS.  ONCE THE NEW PILOT-TRAINING RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PUBLISHED, THERE WILL BE A 15-DAY PUBLIC-COMMENT PERIOD, DURING WHICH AIRLINES WILL BE ABLE TO PROPOSE CHANGES.  A DRAFT REPORT IN APRIL RECOMMENDED SHORT, COMPUTER-BASED TRAINING AND CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION FOR THE NEW SOFTWARE. SIMULATOR TRAINING, WHICH SOME OVERSEAS REGULATORS ARE CONSIDERING, WOULD TAKE LONGER AND IS MORE COSTLY.  BOEING HAS SAID IT IS RECEIVING ONGOING FEEDBACK FROM PILOTS AROUND THE WORLD, WITH NEARLY 90% OF MAX OPERATORS HAVING PARTICIPATED IN SIMULATOR SESSIONS WITH SOFTWARE UPDATES.  CERTIFICATION  ONCE THE TEST FLIGHTS AND PILOT TRAINING RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FINALIZED, THE FAA MUST APPROVE THE JETS FOR FLIGHT. THE AGENCY HAS REPEATEDLY SAID IT WILL NOT CERTIFY THE PLANE UNTIL IT IS SAFE TO DO SO.  EUROPEAN REGULATORS EXPECT TO CLEAR THE 737 MAX IN JANUARY AT THE EARLIEST, FOLLOWING FLIGHT TRIALS BY EUROPEAN TEST PILOTS SCHEDULED FOR MID-DECEMBER.  BOEING CHIEF EXECUTIVE DENNIS MUILENBURG HAS SAID IT IS POSSIBLE NOT ALL REGULATORS AROUND THE WORLD WILL CONCURRENTLY APPROVE THE MAX TO FLY AGAIN.  COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS  WITHOUT THE 737 MAX, AIRLINES THAT WERE FLYING THE JETS BEFORE ITS GROUNDING HAVE HAD TO CANCEL FLIGHTS, CUT ROUTES AND USE AGING JETLINERS.  ONCE REGULATORS APPROVE THE 737 MAX FOR FLIGHT, AIRLINES MUST INSTALL THE NEW SOFTWARE, RUN A SERIES OF MAINTENANCE CHECKS ON THE IDLED JETS AND IMPLEMENT NEW PILOT TRAINING, A PROCESS THAT SOME HAVE SAID COULD TAKE ONE TO TWO MONTHS.  U.S. AND CANADIAN AIRLINES HAVE CANCELED MAX FLIGHTS INTO JANUARY OR FEBRUARY.

THE EMBATTLED PLANEMAKER IS TRYING TO REBUILD TRUST AND COOPERATION WITH AIRLINES, PASSENGERS AND REGULATORS AROUND THE WORLD AFTER THE 737 MAX WAS GROUNDED IN MARCH, FOLLOWING CRASHES IN WHICH A TOTAL OF 346 PEOPLE DIED.

BOEING WILL LAUNCH THE PILOT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT AFTER REGULATORS APPROVE CHANGES TO 737 MAX SOFTWARE AND TRAINING AND THE PLANE RESUMES FLIGHTS, ONE OF THE PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER SAID. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS THAT TO HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES BY YEAR-END.  THE PLANE IS LIKELY TO RETURN TO SERVICE IN EUROPE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, THE HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AVIATION SAFETY AGENCY (EASA) SAID EARLIER THIS WEEK.  THE PILOT PROJECT SPENDING BUDGET, PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH IT SAID, WILL BE IN ADDITION TO THE MORE THAN $8 BILLION IN COSTS FROM COMPENSATION TO AIRLINES FOR DELAYED AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES AND LOWER PRODUCTION TIED TO THE 737 MAX GROUNDING.

IT IS ALSO CONSIDERING WHETHER TO DEVELOP NEW TRAINING MATERIALS OR METHODS FOR VARIOUS CAREER STAGES, AND FUND TRAINING CENTERS OR RECRUITMENT EFFORTS, THE PEOPLE SAID.  BOEING COULD ALSO CREATE A DATA-SHARING NETWORK ON AIRCRAFT DESIGN WITH GLOBAL REGULATORS, ONE OF THE PEOPLE SAID, IN A BID TO IMPROVE OUTSIDE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS AIRCRAFT TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS.  THE HEAD OF THE EASA TOLD REUTERS IN A RECENT INTERVIEW THAT IT WOULD DEMAND MORE DATA WHEN DECIDING WHETHER TO CERTIFY FUTURE JETS.  PILOT SHORTFALL  OUTLINES OF THE NEW INVESTMENT WERE DRAWN UP IN THE WAKE OF THE CRASHES AS BOEING EXECUTIVES ACKNOWLEDGED THAT STALL-PREVENTION SOFTWARE KNOWN AS MCAS CONFUSED THE PILOTS DUE TO AN OVERWHELMING WORKLOAD, THE PEOPLE SAID.  INVESTIGATIONS HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS OVER WHETHER THAT WAS IN PART DUE TO FAULTY ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE HAZARDS INVOLVED, LEADING TO A DESIGN THAT PLACED UNREALISTIC DEMANDS ON PILOTS.  INVESTIGATORS AND GLOBAL REGULATORS HAVE ALSO PINPOINTED CONCERNS ABOUT CERTIFICATION AND TRAINING.  BOEING SAYS IT FOLLOWED INDUSTRY PRACTICE ON REACTION TIMES.  EXPERTS SAY THAT BOEING, AS THE LARGEST PLANEMAKER IN THE WORLD, AND ITS REGULATOR, U.S. FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, HAVE PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN SHAPING GLOBAL STANDARDS AROUND AIRCRAFT DESIGN AND OPERATIONS.  EVEN BEFORE THE CRASHES, THE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY WAS BRACING FOR A STAFFING SHORTFALL OF 1.5 MILLION AIRCRAFT TECHNICIANS AND PILOTS OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS.  BOTH BOEING AND EUROPE\u2019S AIRBUS (AIR.PA) HAVE ALREADY LAUNCHED BEGINNER TRAINING PROGRAMS TO HELP EASE THE SHORTAGES.

WEBB SAID 63 OR 64 OF THE LION AIR CASES HAD SETTLED OR WERE CLOSE TO SETTLEMENT. HE DID NOT DISCLOSE THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT.  THE SECOND CRASH, WHICH KILLED ALL 157 ON BOARD AFTER NOSE-DIVING SOON AFTER TAKE-OFF FROM ADDIS ABABA IN MARCH, LED TO A GLOBAL GROUNDING OF THE BOEING 737 MAX THAT IS STILL ONGOING AND A CRISIS FOR THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST PLANEMAKER.

FILE PHOTO: THE SAFRAN COMPANY LOGO IS PICTURED AT THE COMPANY'S LOGISTIC AREA IN COLOMIERS NEAR TOULOUSE, FRANCE, MARCH 20, 2019. REUTERS/REGIS DUVIGNAU/FILE PHOTO  SAFRAN CO-PRODUCES THE LEAP ENGINE FOR THE MAX THROUGH ITS CFM INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURE WITH GENERAL ELECTRIC (GE.N).  ONCE THE JET RETURNS TO SERVICE - THE TIMING OF WHICH IS IN THE HANDS OF REGULATORS - BOEING PLANS TO REACH A PREVIOUSLY TARGETED PRODUCTION LEVEL OF 57 AIRCRAFT A MONTH BY END-2020 FROM ITS CURRENT RATE OF 42, DOWN FROM 52 BEFORE THE GROUNDING.  IT HAS NOT OFFERED FURTHER DETAILS ON HOW FAST OUTPUT WOULD RISE.  SPEAKING TO A GROUP OF REPORTERS, SAFRAN CEO PHILIPPE PETITCOLIN NOTED PLANEMAKERS LIKE BOEING TYPICALLY ALTER PRODUCTION IN INCREMENTAL STEPS OF 5 AIRCRAFT A MONTH.  \u201cIT IS USUALLY RECOMMENDED TO GO UP BY 5 A MONTH EVERY 6 MONTHS, OTHERWISE YOU CAN LOSE EVERYONE (SUPPLIERS),\u201d HE SAID.  HE DECLINED TO COMMENT DIRECTLY ON BOEING PRODUCTION PLANS, BUT HIS COMMENTS SUGGEST THE PLANEMAKER MAY NOT FIND IT EASY TO REACH 57 A MONTH UNTIL 2021, EVEN IF THE MAX IS UNGROUNDED THIS YEAR.  BOEING\u2019S CURRENT PLAN IMPLIES OUTPUT INCREASES EVERY FOUR MONTHS INSTEAD OF EVERY SIX, A RATE OF CHANGE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN THAT PETITCOLIN DESCRIBED AS AMBITIOUS.  BOEING SAID ANY PRODUCTION INCREASES WOULD OCCUR GRADUALLY ONCE DELIVERIES RESUMED, ENSURING THE HEALTH OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND KEEPING PRODUCTION SYSTEMS STABLE.  \u201cWE CONTINUE TO ASSESS PRODUCTION DECISIONS AND ALWAYS WORK ON PLANS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS,\u201d A SPOKESMAN SAID.  NOT ALL SUPPLIERS ARE EXPOSED TO THE SAME PRESSURE. SOME HAVE CONTINUED TO PRODUCE AT 52 A MONTH DURING THE CRISIS IN ORDER TO AVOID KINKS IN PRODUCTION.  ONCE THE GROUNDING IS LIFTED, BOEING HAS SUGGESTED IT CAN DELIVER 70 MAX AIRCRAFT A MONTH, MATCHING THE MOST IT HAS DELIVERED IN ANY PREVIOUS MONTH.  THE ACTUAL PRODUCTION RATE IN ITS ASSEMBLY PLANT MAY DEPEND ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH BOEING DECIDES TO MEET THIS GOAL DIRECTLY FROM THE PRODUCTION LINE OR FROM THE HUNDREDS OF AIRCRAFT NOW IN STORAGE, WHICH HAVE BEEN BUILT DURING THE GROUNDING.  PETITCOLIN SAID CFM WOULD WORK HARD TO RESPOND TO WHATEVER PRODUCTION RATE BOEING DEEMED NECESSARY.  IT IS ALSO BRACING FOR INCREASED DEMAND FOR LEAP ENGINES FROM EUROPE\u2019S AIRBUS BECAUSE OF INCREASES IN CFM SALES AGAINST RIVAL PRATT & WHITNEY (UTX.N).

THE 737 MAX HAS BEEN GROUNDED SINCE MARCH AFTER TWO CRASHES IN INDONESIA AND ETHIOPIA KILLED 346 PEOPLE WITHIN FIVE MONTHS, COSTING THE MANUFACTURER MORE THAN $9 BILLION SO FAR.  \u201cEACH SUPPLIER WILL LIKELY BE MISSING ABOUT 200 DELIVERIES VERSUS ORIGINAL PLANS, WITH ABOUT 80% OF THE SHORTFALL COMING IN 2020 AND THE REMAINDER IN 2021,\u201d MELIUS RESEARCH ANALYST CARTER COPELAND WROTE IN A NOTE.

THE TEAM WILL \u201cPROVIDE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS\u201d NEEDED BEFORE STARLINER CAN FLY A CREW OF ASTRONAUTS FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT ADDED, SAYING THE PROBE WILL TAKE ABOUT TWO MONTHS.  NASA SAID IT WAS WEIGHING WHETHER TO MAKE BOEING REPEAT THE TEST, WHICH WOULD LIKELY COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND ADD FURTHER DELAY, TO SHOW IT CAN DOCK AT THE STATION SUCCESSFULLY. DOCKING WAS A KEY REQUIREMENT FOR THE TEST UNDER BOEING\u2019S CONTRACT.  \u201cALTHOUGH DATA FROM THE UNCREWED TEST IS IMPORTANT FOR CERTIFICATION, IT MAY NOT BE THE ONLY WAY THAT BOEING IS ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE ITS SYSTEM\u2019S FULL CAPABILITIES,\u201d THE AGENCY SAID.  IT ADDED THAT IT WOULD TAKE NASA \u201cSEVERAL WEEKS\u201d TO DECIDE WHETHER BOEING WILL NEED TO RE-DO ITS TEST OR CARRY ON TO THE FINAL TEST FLIGHT OF LOFTING HUMANS TO THE SPACE STATION, SET FOR LATER THIS YEAR.  THE SPACECRAFT, A CONE-SHAPED POD WITH SEATS FOR SEVEN ASTRONAUTS, LANDED SUCCESSFULLY IN WHITE SANDS, NEW MEXICO SIX DAYS EARLIER THAN PLANNED, AFTER ITS DECEMBER LAUNCH.  THE LANDING, WHICH TESTED THE CAPSULE\u2019S DIFFICULT RE-ENTRY INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND PARACHUTE DEPLOYMENT, YIELDED THE MISSION\u2019S MOST VALUABLE TEST DATA, NASA ADMINISTRATOR JIM BRIDENSTINE SAID.  NASA AWARDED $4.2 BILLION TO BOEING AND $2.5 BILLION TO ELON MUSK\u2019S RIVAL SPACEX IN 2014 TO DEVELOP SEPARATE CAPSULE SYSTEMS CAPABLE OF FERRYING ASTRONAUTS TO THE SPACE STATION FROM U.S. SOIL FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE NASA\u2019S SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM ENDED IN 2011. NASA HAS SINCE RELIED ON RUSSIAN SPACECRAFT FOR HITCHING RIDES TO THE SPACE STATION.  SPACEX IS ALSO IN THE MIDST OF A JOINT INVESTIGATION WITH NASA AFTER ITS CREW DRAGON ASTRONAUT CAPSULE EXPLODED LAST APRIL ON A TEST STAND IN FLORIDA, MOMENTS BEFORE TEST-FIRING A SUITE OF ROCKET THRUSTERS MEANT TO PROPEL ITS CREW TO SAFETY IN THE EVENT OF A ROCKET FAILURE.", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2020-01-07T00:00:00", "key": "20200107BA", "labelr0": 1.0607059387547084, "labelr1": -1.7522533206831028, "labelr2": 1.4998340223918791, "labelr3": -1.9087827793304275, "labelr4": 0.090931134820566, "pos": 0.122, "neg": 0.129, "compound": -0.0258, "0_day_return": 1.0607059387547135, "1_day_return": -1.752253320683106, "2_day_return": -0.27870018975331146, "3_day_return": -2.1821631878557683, "4_day_return": -2.0932163187855517, "label": -1, "return": 0.004902451310513047, "excess_return": -1.7571557719936193, "count_of_word": 431, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5397624, "prof1": 0.46023762, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4521679874193568, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5478320125806432, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5397624, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.46023762, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.4732632000000001, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.5267368, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.48354134, "tr_prof1": 0.51645863, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.47557065, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.5244293999999999, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.59071165, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.40928835, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.37235892, "headline_prof21": 0.62764114, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.39718154, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.6028184, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.47624624, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.52375376, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.85012394, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.14987609999999998, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -1.752253320683106, "returnpredvader": 1.752253320683106, "returnpredsgd": -1.752253320683106, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0035000427747285, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.006976590532317, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0035000427747285, "cumreturn1b": 1.2496978960195655, "cumreturn1d": 0.9058708546543748, "cumreturn1e": 1.2799603610410348, "cumreturndow": 1.2848053764321095, "cumreturnsp500": 1.2266843077347356}, {"Unnamed: 0": 16767, "Unnamed: 0.1": 16767, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 16767, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 16767, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 16767, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 16767, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16767, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16767, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16767, "level_0": 16767, "index": 16767, "text": "  PLANE WAS BOEING 737-800    DEAD INCLUDE 82 IRANIANS, 63 CANADIANS    CRASH HAPPENS HOURS AFTER MISSILE STRIKES    INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES SEE TECHNICAL MALFUNCTION - SOURCE (ADDS SOURCE ON EARLY INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT)  BY BABAK DEHGHANPISHEH AND MATTHIAS WILLIAMS  DUBAI/KIEV, JAN 8 (REUTERS) - A UKRAINIAN AIRLINER CRASHED SHORTLY AFTER TAKE-OFF FROM TEHRAN ON WEDNESDAY, KILLING ALL 176 PEOPLE ON BOARD AND SPARKING AN INTERNATIONAL SCRAMBLE TO ESTABLISH THE CAUSE.  THE UKRAINE INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES BOEING 737-800, EN ROUTE TO KIEV AND CARRYING MOSTLY IRANIANS AND IRANIAN-CANADIANS, CRASHED HOURS AFTER IRAN FIRED MISSILES AT BASES HOUSING U.S. FORCES IN IRAQ, LEADING SOME TO SPECULATE THAT THE PLANE MAY HAVE BEEN HIT.  BUT A CANADIAN SECURITY SOURCE, WHO ASKED NOT TO BE NAMED, TOLD REUTERS THAT THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF WESTERN INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES WAS THAT THE PLANE HAD SUFFERED A TECHNICAL MALFUNCTION AND HAD NOT BEEN BROUGHT DOWN BY A MISSILE. THERE WAS EVIDENCE ONE OF THE JET\u2019S ENGINES HAD OVERHEATED, THE SOURCE SAID.  THE CRASH COMES AT A DIFFICULT TIME FOR PLANEMAKER BOEING CO , WHICH HAS GROUNDED ITS 737 MAX FLEET AFTER TWO CRASHES LAST YEAR. THE 737-800 IS ONE OF THE WORLD\u2019S MOST-FLOWN MODELS WITH A GOOD SAFETY RECORD AND DOES NOT HAVE THE SOFTWARE FEATURE IMPLICATED IN CRASHES OF THE 737 MAX.  \u201cWE ARE IN CONTACT WITH OUR AIRLINE CUSTOMERS AND STAND BY THEM IN THIS DIFFICULT TIME. WE ARE READY TO ASSIST IN ANY WAY NEEDED,\u201d THE MANUFACTURER SAID IN A STATEMENT EARLIER ON WEDNESDAY. IT DECLINED FURTHER COMMENT. BOEING SHARES FELL 1.3% ON WEDNESDAY.  IN PARIS ON WEDNESDAY MORNING, THE MAKER OF THE PLANE\u2019S ENGINES, FRENCH-U.S. FIRM CFM - CO-OWNED BY GENERAL ELECTRIC CO AND FRANCE\u2019S SAFRAN - SAID SPECULATION REGARDING THE CAUSE WAS PREMATURE.  SMOULDERING PARTS AND DEBRIS, INCLUDING SHOES AND CLOTHES, WERE STREWN ACROSS A FIELD SOUTHWEST OF THE IRANIAN CAPITAL, WHERE RESCUE WORKERS IN FACE MASKS LAID OUT SCORES OF BODY BAGS.  AMONG THE VICTIMS WERE 82 IRANIANS, 63 CANADIANS, AND 11 UKRAINIANS, UKRAINIAN AUTHORITIES SAID. THE TEHRAN-TORONTO VIA KIEV ROUTE WAS A POPULAR ONE FOR CANADIANS OF IRANIAN DESCENT VISITING IRAN, IN THE ABSENCE OF DIRECT FLIGHTS, AND CARRIED MANY STUDENTS AND ACADEMICS HEADING HOME FROM THE HOLIDAYS.  THE VICTIMS INCLUDED A NEWLYWED COUPLE THAT HAD GONE TO IRAN TO GET MARRIED. ARASH POURZARABI, 26, AND POUNEH GOURJI, 25, WERE GRADUATE STUDENTS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA. FOUR MEMBERS OF THEIR WEDDING PARTY WERE ALSO ON BOARD.  AT KIEV\u2019S MAIN AIRPORT, CANDLES AND FLOWERS WERE LAID NEXT TO PICTURES OF THE DECEASED UKRAINIAN CREW MEMBERS. KATERYNA GAPONENKO, WHO WAS MARRIED TO PILOT VOLODYMYR GAPONENKO, TOLD LOCAL CHANNEL 1+1 THAT SHE HAD PLEADED WITH HER HUSBAND BEFORE THE FLIGHT NOT TO FLY TO TEHRAN.  IT WAS KIEV-BASED UKRAINE INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES\u2019 FIRST FATAL CRASH, AND THE CARRIER SAID IT WAS DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH THE CAUSE.  UKRAINE SAID IT WAS SENDING A TEAM OF EXPERTS TO IRAN TO INVESTIGATE. PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKIY SAID HE HAD INSTRUCTED UKRAINE\u2019S PROSECUTOR GENERAL TO OPEN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS, WITHOUT SPECIFYING WHO THEY WOULD INVOLVE.  CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU SAID CANADA WOULD \u201cCONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH ITS INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THIS CRASH IS THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED\u201d AND U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO SAID THE UNITED STATES WAS CALLING FOR COMPLETE COOPERATION WITH ANY INVESTIGATION INTO CAUSE OF THE CRASH.  UNDER INTERNATIONAL RULES, RESPONSIBILITY FOR INVESTIGATING THE CRASH LIES WITH IRAN. IRANIAN STATE TELEVISION SAID BOTH OF THE PLANE\u2019S BLACK BOX VOICE AND DATA RECORDERS HAD BEEN FOUND.  THE SEMI-OFFICIAL MEHR NEWS AGENCY QUOTED THE HEAD OF IRAN\u2019S CIVIL AVIATION ORGANISATION AS SAYING IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHICH COUNTRY IRAN WOULD SEND THE BLACK BOXES TO FOR ANALYSIS OF THE DATA, BUT IT WOULD NOT GIVE THEM TO BOEING.  AMATEUR VIDEO  THE PLANE THAT CRASHED WAS A THREE-YEAR-OLD BOEING 737-800NG. ITS LAST SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE WAS ON JAN. 6, UKRAINE INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES SAID.  AN AMATEUR VIDEO, RUN BY IRANIAN NEWS AGENCIES AND PURPORTEDLY OF THE CRASHING PLANE, SHOWED A DESCENDING FLASH IN A DARK SKY. IT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY COMMENTS THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS \u201cON FIRE\u201d AND THEN A BRIGHTER FLASH AS IT APPEARS TO HIT THE GROUND. REUTERS COULD NOT AUTHENTICATE THE FOOTAGE.  EARLY ON WEDNESDAY, IRAN HAD FIRED MORE THAN A DOZEN BALLISTIC MISSILES AT BASES HOUSING U.S. FORCES IN IRAQ IN RETALIATION FOR A U.S. DRONE STRIKE LAST WEEK THAT KILLED AN IRANIAN MILITARY COMMANDER.  SOME AIRLINES CANCELLED IRAN AND IRAQ FLIGHTS AND RE-ROUTED OTHERS AWAY FROM BOTH COUNTRIES\u2019 AIRSPACE FOLLOWING THE MISSILE STRIKES. THE EUROPEAN AVIATION SAFETY AGENCY RECOMMENDED THAT COMMERCIAL FLIGHTS AVOID IRAQI AIRSPACE.  IRANIAN TV PUT THE CRASH DOWN TO UNSPECIFIED TECHNICAL PROBLEMS, AND IRANIAN MEDIA QUOTED A LOCAL AVIATION OFFICIAL AS SAYING THE PILOT DID NOT DECLARE AN EMERGENCY.  SAFETY EXPERTS SAY AIRLINER ACCIDENTS RARELY HAVE A SINGLE CAUSE AND THAT IT TYPICALLY TAKES MONTHS OF INVESTIGATION TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE FACTORS BEHIND THEM.  MODERN AIRCRAFT ARE DESIGNED AND CERTIFIED TO COPE WITH AN ENGINE FAILURE SHORTLY AFTER TAKE-OFF AND TO FLY FOR EXTENDED PERIODS ON ONE ENGINE. BUT AN UNCONTAINED ENGINE FAILURE RELEASING SHRAPNEL CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO OTHER AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS.", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2020-01-08T00:00:00", "key": "20200108BA", "labelr0": -1.7522533206831028, "labelr1": 1.4998340223918791, "labelr2": -1.9087827793304275, "labelr3": 0.090931134820566, "labelr4": 0.6450245291018094, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.489, "compound": -0.8225, "0_day_return": -1.752253320683106, "1_day_return": 1.4998340223918882, "2_day_return": -0.4375773304765018, "3_day_return": -0.3470440896882532, "4_day_return": 0.2957419199082656, "label": 1, "return": 0.006655262499467345, "excess_return": 1.4931787598924209, "count_of_word": 851, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.40849543, "prof1": 0.5915045, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4785581664467398, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5214418335532602, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.40849543, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.5915045, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.38038197, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.619618, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.54388297, "tr_prof1": 0.45611709999999994, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5484869000000001, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.4515131, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.54047376, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.4595262, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.46369356, "headline_prof21": 0.53630644, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.36758536, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.63241464, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.37825173, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.62174827, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.7175309, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.28246906, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -1.4998340223918882, "returnpredvader": -1.4998340223918882, "returnpredsgd": 1.4998340223918882, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0086664864148371, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0086664864148371, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0073939180565115, "cumreturn1b": 1.2605283858580696, "cumreturn1d": 0.9137215721098338, "cumreturn1e": 1.289424283066155, "cumreturndow": 1.2933560934729922, "cumreturnsp500": 1.2357232314475395}, {"Unnamed: 0": 16825, "Unnamed: 0.1": 16825, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 16825, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 16825, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 16825, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 16825, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16825, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16825, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16825, "level_0": 16825, "index": 16825, "text": "FILE PHOTO: BOEING 787 DREAMLINERS ARE SHOWN IN FINAL PRODUCTION AT WIDEBODY FACTORY IN NORTH CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA, U.S., JANUARY 17, 2019.

BOEING HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE TIMING OF DECISIONS TO REMOVE THE NO-FLY ORDER COULD VARY AMONG DIFFERENT REGULATORS AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAVE EACH PINPOINTED THEIR OWN CONCERNS OVER THE 737 MAX JET.  \u201cWE ARE NOT BOUND EXCLUSIVELY WITH WHAT THE FAA COMES OUT WITH,\u201d SAID DAVID TURNBULL, DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL AIRCRAFT CERTIFICATION FOR TRANSPORT CANADA, DURING GOVERNMENT HEARINGS ON TUESDAY.  THE FAA DECLINED COMMENT.  TRANSPORT CANADA DID NOT SPECIFY WHICH CANADIAN-UNIQUE PROCEDURES IT WAS REFERRING TO.  FOLLOWING THE CRASH OF A LION AIR MAX JET IN 2018, TRANSPORT CANADA ADDED THE REQUIREMENT OF A FIVE-STEP MEMORIZED PILOT CHECKLIST IN THE CASE OF A RUNAWAY STABILIZER.  CANADA IS HOLDING HEARINGS ON AIRCRAFT CERTIFICATION TO STUDY HOW THE 737 MAX JET WAS APPROVED TO FLY IN THE COUNTRY.  EASA IS NOT CURRENTLY HOLDING HEARINGS BUT SAID IT WOULD ADDRESS SUCH LESSONS AFTER THE MAX IS SET TO FLY.  CANADA ACCEPTED THE FAA\u2019S MARCH 2017 CERTIFICATION OF THE 737 MAX UNDER A RECIPROCAL DEAL IN WHICH SUCH APPROVALS BY THE FAA ARE ACCEPTED BY TRANSPORT CANADA AND EASA AND VICE VERSA.  SOME OF TRANSPORT CANADA\u2019S CONCERNS, LIKE THE NEED FOR SIMULATOR TRAINING FOR MAX PILOTS, ARE NOW BEING REFLECTED IN RECOMMENDATIONS BY BOEING, WHICH CHANGED ITS POSITION ON THE MATTER IN JANUARY, TURNBULL NOTED. [L1N2AP0F8]  \u201cFORTUNATELY, IN SOME CASES, AS THE TIME WENT ALONG THEY STARTED TO ADOPT THESE IDEAS,\u201d HE SAID.  \u201cI GUESS THEY CAME TO THEIR OWN CONCLUSIONS AND VALIDATED OUR CONCERNS.

REUTERS/BRENDAN MCDERMID - RC1901E5ACE0/FILE PHOTO  THE SOURCE SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS TAKING THE STEP BECAUSE OF OVERALL MARKET VOLATILITY AND NOT DUE TO THE CHANGING OF THE RETURN TO SERVICE DATE OF ITS 737 MAX AIRCRAFT, WHICH HAS BEEN STEADILY PUSHED OUT AND IS NOW EXPECTED AT EARLIEST MID-YEAR.  BOEING\u2019S SHARES FELL AS MUCH AS 11% TO $205.56 ON NEWS OF THE LOAN DRAWDOWN, INITIALLY REPORTED BY BLOOMBERG NEWS, BROADLY IN LINE WITH A COLLAPSE IN AIRLINE AND OTHER AEROSPACE SHARES ACROSS THE BOARD.  THE PLANEMAKER MAY DRAW DOWN THE MONEY AS EARLY AS FRIDAY, THE SOURCE SAID.  BOEING HAD NO IMMEDIATE COMMENT.  U.S. COMPANIES HAVE BEEN RUSHING TO BORROW MORE MONEY AND BOOST THEIR CASH COFFERS THIS WEEK, AS MARKET TURMOIL FUELED BY A PLUNGE IN OIL PRICES AND THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK RAISED THE PROSPECT OF AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.  AIRLINES HAVE BEEN AMONG THE WORST HIT, AS A COLLAPSE IN BOOKINGS AND BUSINESS TRAVEL FORCED RADICAL CUTS IN FLIGHT SCHEDULES, CAPACITY AND ANNUAL RESULTS FORECASTS.  BOEING\u2019S TOTAL DEBT NEARLY DOUBLED TO $27.3 BILLION IN 2019, AS IT COMPENSATED AIRLINES AND GRAPPLED WITH ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION COSTS FOR THE 737 MAX EVEN AS THE GROUNDING PREVENTED IT FROM DELIVERING THE AIRCRAFT TO BUYERS.  MEDIA REPORTED LAST MONTH THAT THE PLANEMAKER HAD RAISED A TOTAL OF $13.825 BILLION IN A FUND RAISING ROUND FROM LENDERS INCLUDING BANK OF CHINA AND PNC. ANALYSTS ESTIMATED LAST YEAR THAT THE COMPANY WAS LEAKING AROUND $1 BILLION MONTHLY AS A RESULT OF THE MAX GROUNDING.

JOHNSON  PARIS/SAO PAULO/SEATTLE, MARCH 19 (REUTERS) - BRAZIL HAS UPHELD PROPOSALS BY BOEING CO TO BUY THE JETMAKING ARM OF EMBRAER, BUT PLUNGING MARKETS HAVE RAISED URGENT QUESTIONS OVER THE FATE OF THE $4.2 BILLION DEAL AS AVIATION REELS FROM THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS.  BRAZIL\u2019S ANTI-TRUST WATCHDOG DISMISSED PROSECUTORS\u2019 OBJECTIONS TO THE POLITICALLY SENSITIVE DEAL ON WEDNESDAY.  A SLUMP IN EMBRAER SHARES AND CASH CONCERNS AT BOEING DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS ON AIR TRAVEL DEALT A BLOW TO THE DEAL\u2019S FRAGILE ECONOMICS, HOWEVER, COMPOUNDING UNCERTAINTY CAUSED BY DELAYS IN WINNING EUROPEAN UNION REGULATORY APPROVAL.  SHARES IN THE WORLD\u2019S THIRD-LARGEST PLANEMAKER FELL 14% ON WEDNESDAY, GIVING IT A MARKET VALUE OF ABOUT $1.3 BILLION AFTER FALLING BY TWO THIRDS SINCE THE DEAL WAS FIRST AIRED IN 2018, ACCORDING TO REFINITIV EIKON DATA.  AT SUCH PRICES, BOEING WOULD GAIN CONTROL OF THE COMMERCIAL UNIT OF EMBRAER BUT ONLY AFTER PAYING THREE TIMES THE VALUE OF THE WHOLE COMPANY, WHICH ALSO MAKES MILITARY AND BUSINESS JETS.  BOEING HAS OFFERED TO PAY $4.2 BILLION IN CASH FOR 80% OF EMBRAER\u2019S COMMERCIAL UNIT, WHICH BUILDS JETLINERS IN THE 70- TO 150-SEAT SEGMENT AND COMPETES WITH THE CANADIAN-DESIGNED A220 PROGRAMME RECENTLY ACQUIRED BY EUROPE\u2019S AIRBUS.  RECENT TRENDS \u201cHAVE INCREASED THE CHANCES THAT THIS DEAL DOES NOT GET DONE,\u201d CANACCORD GENUITY ANALYST KEN HERBERT SAID.  AT STAKE IS A KEY PLANK OF BOEING\u2019S STRATEGY FOR EXPANDING ITS ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL BASE JUST AS IT FACES TALKS OVER $60 BILLION OF U.S. SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. AEROSPACE INDUSTRY.  WHILE BOEING COULD, ANALYSTS NOTE, SEEK A LOWER PRICE, PLEDGES BAKED INTO THE DEAL DURING MONTHS OF SENSITIVE NEGOTIATIONS LEAVE EMBRAER\u2019S SHAREHOLDERS LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE BARRING A SHARP REBOUND.  EMBRAER PLANS TO PAY A $1.6 BILLION SPECIAL DIVIDEND TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS OUT OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE TRANSACTION.  AFTER ALLOWING FOR TAXES, THE PLAN WOULD PLACE EMBRAER\u2019S COMMERCIAL ARM LED BY JOHN SLATTERY IN A NEW BOEING-LED VENTURE COMPETING WITH AIRBUS\u2019S A220 AND KEEP ASIDE SOME $1 BILLION OF NET CASH FOR EMBRAER\u2019S REMAINING DEFENCE AND PRIVATE-JET UNITS.  EMBRAER\u2019S BATTERED MARKET VALUE THREATENS TO UPEND THOSE CALCULATIONS, BARRING AN UNLIKELY DECISION TO FOREGO THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND OR SADDLE THE OLD EMBRAER WITH DEBT, ANALYSTS SAID.  SUPPORT PLAN  BOEING\u2019S NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE, DAVE CALHOUN, SAID IN JANUARY HE WAS COMMITTED TO THE DEAL. HE MUST NOW CONVINCE BOEING\u2019S BOARD TO PURSUE IT WHILE ALSO FACING CRITICS IN CONGRESS WHO ARE QUESTIONING HOW POTENTIAL U.S. TAXPAYER FUNDS WOULD BE DEPLOYED.  \u201cTHEY ARE GOING TO WASHINGTON WITH THEIR HANDS OUT FOR A BAILOUT AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND LOOKING AT SPENDING $4.2 BILLION TO COMPLETE THE DEAL,\u201d HERBERT SAID.  CALHOUN\u2019S $7 MILLION PERFORMANCE BONUS, PART OF A THREE-YEAR PACKAGE TETHERED TO BOEING\u2019S SHARE PRICE, HANGS IN PART ON HIS ABILITY TO CLOSE THE EMBRAER DEAL, ASSUMING REGULATORY APPROVAL.  \u201cWE DON\u2019T COMMENT PUBLICLY ON DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES OR MARKET SPECULATION. WE ARE ADDRESSING THE REGULATORY APPROVALS PROCESS AND OUTSTANDING CLOSING CONDITIONS,\u201d A BOEING SPOKESWOMAN SAID.  EMBRAER DECLINED TO COMMENT.  EMBRAER\u2019S OPTIONS SHOULD THE DEAL FAIL HAVE NOT BEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED AND POTENTIAL ALLIANCE PARTNERS ARE SCARCE.  BEFORE THE HEALTH SCARE HAMMERED MARKETS, SOME AIRLINES HAD URGED THE EU TO LIFT WHAT THEN SEEMED THE ONLY SERIOUS OBSTACLE TO THE DEAL, FEARING EMBRAER\u2019S JETLINER BUSINESS WOULD STRUGGLE ON ITS OWN NOW THAT AIRBUS OWNS A COMPETITOR.

THE COMMENTS ON CREDIT IN AN INTERVIEW WITH REUTERS APPEARED TO UNDERSCORE THE U.S. PLANEMAKER\u2019S OPPOSITION TO GRANTING EQUITY AS PART OF AN INDUSTRY-WIDE GOVERNMENT BAILOUT DEAL.  U.S. LAWMAKERS HAVE SAID THEY COULD DEMAND STOCK OR EQUITY-BASED INSTRUMENTS LIKE WARRANTS OR OPTIONS AS A CONDITION OF GOVERNMENT LOANS.  \u201cHAVING ACCESS TO THE CREDIT MARKETS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US RIGHT NOW,\u201d BOEING CFO GREG SMITH SAID WHEN ASKED WHETHER BOEING COULD ISSUE SUCH INSTRUMENTS IN RETURN FOR SUPPORT.  CHIEF EXECUTIVE DAVE CALHOUN TOLD FOX BUSINESS EARLIER ON TUESDAY THAT BOEING COULD \u201cTAKE A DIFFERENT COURSE\u201d IF LAWMAKERS \u201cATTACH TOO MANY THINGS\u201d TO A STIMULUS PACKAGE.  BOEING HAS SOUGHT $60 BILLION IN U.S. GOVERNMENT LOANS OR LOAN GUARANTEES FOR ITSELF AND THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY.  CONGRESS WAS EXPECTED REACH AGREEMENT ON A STIMULUS AND RESCUE PACKAGE WORTH UP TO $2 TRILLION TO RESPOND TO ECONOMIC DAMAGE FROM THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC AS SOON AS TUESDAY.  SMITH SAID BOEING, WHICH DREW DOWN A $13.8 CREDIT LINE IT TOOK IN FEBRUARY BUT HAS A FURTHER $9.6 BILLION IN RESERVE, WAS NOT IN DISCUSSIONS TO ADD NEW COMMERCIAL DEBT FACILITIES.  \u201cNOT RIGHT NOW. THE MARKETS ESSENTIALLY ARE CLOSED,\u201d SMITH SAID. \u201cI MEAN, THERE\u2019S REALLY NOT MUCH OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE ANY ADDITIONAL DEBT. THAT\u2019S ONE OF THE CHALLENGES.\u201d  RATING AGENCY FITCH RATINGS MEANWHILE DOWNGRADED BOEING TO \u2018BBB\u2019 FROM \u2018A-\u2018, CITING THE RAPID ESCALATION OF THE PANDEMIC AND ITS EFFECT ON BOEING\u2019S AVIATION MARKETS AND OPERATIONS.

BOEING SAYS IT BACKED OUT BECAUSE EMBRAER FAILED TO MEET UNNAMED CONDITIONS.  POTENTIAL DEALBREAKERS ARE OFTEN DESCRIBED IN CONTRACTS AS MATERIAL ADVERSE EVENTS. BUT BOEING AND EMBRAER WROTE OUT A LAUNDRY LIST IN THE CONTRACT SIGNED IN JANUARY 2019, WHICH REUTERS REVIEWED, OF 10 CONDITIONS THAT WOULD NOT QUALIFY AS THE KIND OF MATERIAL ADVERSE EVENTS THAT COULD BE A PRETEXT FOR CANCELLING THE DEAL. A PANDEMIC AND ANY CHANGES TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WERE AMONG THEM.  ON WEDNESDAY, S&P LOWERED BOEING\u2019S CREDIT RATING TO JUST ONE NOTCH ABOVE JUNK.

EITHER WAY, THE CONTRACT SAYS BOEING COULD HAVE WAIVED ANY UNMET CONDITIONS ON THE PART OF EMBRAER, BUT THE U.S. PLANEMAKER DECIDED NOT TO DO SO AND CANCELED THE DEAL INSTEAD.  BOTH EMBRAER AND BOEING DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE CONTRACT.  \u201cBOEING COULDN\u2019T AFFORD THIS DEAL AND THEY FOUND A WAY TO GET OUT OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS,\u201d SAID SCOTT HAMILTON, A LONGTIME AVIATION CONSULTANT AT LEEHAM COMPANY. \u201cTHEY JUST HAD TO FIND A WAY TO AXE THE DEAL AND RETAIN THOSE $4 BILLION.\u201d  UNDER THE CONTRACT SIGNED IN JANUARY 2019, BOEING WOULD HAVE TAKEN OVER EMBRAER\u2019S COMMERCIAL AVIATION UNIT, PAYING $4.21 BILLION FOR AN 80% STAKE. AT THE TIME, DEMAND FOR JETS WAS SOARING WITH NO END IN SIGHT AND EMBRAER WAS FEELING THE PINCH OF FIGHTING AGAINST TITANS BOEING AND AIRBUS AS AN INDEPENDENT PLANEMAKER.  THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS WORSENED IN MARCH AND BOEING STARTED OPENLY DISCUSSING SOME FORM OF U.S. GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE, AS IT WAS ALSO GETTING NEARER TO CLOSING THE EMBRAER DEAL. SEVERAL COUNTRIES HAD GRANTED ANTITRUST APPROVALS AND EMBRAER HAD FINISHED CARVING OUT ITS COMMERCIAL AVIATION UNIT AS WELL AS BUILT NEW HEADQUARTERS FOR AFTER BOEING\u2019S TAKEOVER.  BESIDES \u201cEPIDEMICS OR PANDEMICS,\u201d AND CHANGES IN THE WORLD\u2019S ECONOMY, WARS AND NATURAL DISASTERS WERE ALSO BARRED AS REASONS TO CANCEL THE DEAL.

FILE PHOTO: THE BOEING LOGO IS DISPLAYED ON A SCREEN, AT THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (NYSE) IN NEW YORK, U.S., AUGUST 7, 2019. REUTERS/BRENDAN MCDERMID  THE TRANSATLANTIC DISPUTE OVER SUPPORT FOR EUROPE\u2019S AIRBUS (AIR.PA) AND U.S. RIVAL BOEING (BA.N) HAS ALREADY LED TO U.S. TARIFFS ON EUROPEAN GOODS AND COULD LEAD TO A TIT-FOR-TAT EU RESPONSE.  THE UNITED STATES SAID ON WEDNESDAY IT HAD NOTIFIED THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) THAT IT HAD FULLY COMPLIED WITH WTO FINDINGS BY REPEALING TAX BREAKS FOR BOEING IN WASHINGTON STATE.  WASHINGTON STATE\u2019S LEGISLATURE IN MARCH REPEALED THE PREFERENTIAL AEROSPACE TAX BREAK FIRST INTRODUCED 16 YEARS AGO, WHICH SAVED BOEING SOME $118 MILLION IN 2018 BASED ON ITS PUBLISHED JETLINER REVENUE.  THE WTO HAS FOUND THE WORLD\u2019S TWO LARGEST PLANEMAKERS RECEIVED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF UNFAIR SUBSIDIES IN A PAIR OF CASES DATING BACK TO 2004.  LAST YEAR IT ALLOWED THE UNITED STATES TO LEVY TARIFFS ON $7.5 BILLION WORTH OF EU GOODS, INCLUDING AIRCRAFT, WINES AND CHEESE, DUE TO AIRBUS SUBSIDIES THAT IT HAD DEEMED ILLEGAL.  NOW IT IS CONSIDERING WHETHER TO GRANT SIMILAR RIGHTS TO THE EU IN A PARALLEL CASE INVOLVING ILLEGAL SUPPORT FOR BOEING.  \u201cWITH WASHINGTON STATE\u2019S REPEAL OF THIS RELATIVELY MINOR TAX REDUCTION, THE UNITED STATES HAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE WTO\u2019S RECOMMENDATION, ENDING THIS DISPUTE,\u201d U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE ROBERT LIGHTHIZER SAID. \u201cTHIS STEP ENSURES THAT THERE IS NO VALID BASIS FOR THE EU TO RETALIATE AGAINST ANY U.S. GOODS.\u201d  WEDNESDAY\u2019S FORMAL U.S. SUBMISSION TO THE WTO AIMS TO NEUTRALIZE THE EU\u2019S DEMAND FOR SOME $10 BILLION IN ANNUAL TARIFFS, USTR SAID.  BUT THE EU\u2019S EXECUTIVE COMMISSION REJECTED THE MOVE AND SAID THE UNITED STATES REMAINED OUT OF STEP WITH THE WTO\u2019S RULE-SETTING DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BODY.  \u201cTHE EU DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE U.S. UNILATERAL ASSERTION THAT IT HAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE DSB RECOMMENDATIONS AND RULINGS IN THIS DISPUTE,\u201d IT SAID.  THE EU SAID IT WAS STILL STUDYING THE STATE TAX REPEAL, BUT LISTED OTHER MEASURES WHERE IT SAID THE UNITED STATES HAD FAILED TO COMPLY WITH WTO RULINGS ON AID FOR BOEING, INCLUDING RESEARCH SUPPORT FROM NASA AND THE PENTAGON.  THE UNITED STATES DENIES THAT ANY OTHER MEASURES ARE OUTSTANDING IN THE BOEING CASE AND SAID ON WEDNESDAY THAT THE ABOLITION OF TAX BREAKS BROUGHT THE MARATHON CASE TO A CLOSE.  EU TARIFF RULING AWAITED  THE SPAT BRINGS THE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY A STEP CLOSER TO AN EXPANDED TARIFF WAR.  THE UNITED STATES RAISED TARIFFS ON AIRBUS PLANES TO 15% FROM 10% ON MARCH 17, THOUGH THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT IS MUTED AS MANY AIRLINES DELAY DELIVERIES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC.  THE WTO IS EXPECTED TO ISSUE A DECISION ON THE EU TARIFF REQUEST IN JUNE.  EU OFFICIALS HAVE EMPHASIZED THEIR DESIRE TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THE DISPUTE, WHILE U.S. SOURCES HAVE SAID THIS HAS NOT LED TO CONCRETE PROPOSALS.  AIRBUS HAS SAID IT IS FOR THE WTO TO RULE ON COMPLIANCE WHILE BOEING SAYS IT HAS ADVOCATED AGAINST ITS OWN ECONOMIC INTEREST FOR THE TAX BREAKS TO BE REPEALED TO PROTECT RULES-BASED TRADE.  BOEING WAS REPORTED TO HAVE LOBBIED IN THE PAST FOR THE TAX BREAKS TO BE INTRODUCED AND LATER EXTENDED, WHILE AIRBUS LOST A SEPARATE BID TO PROVE THEY WERE A MORE SERIOUS WTO VIOLATION.  THE WTO DECISION ON EU RETALIATION IS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE WELL BEFORE ANY COMPLIANCE PROCEEDING COULD BE COMPLETED.

BRITAIN\u2019S PARLIAMENT IS DUE TO VOTE LATER IN THE DAY ON WHETHER THE COUNTRY SHOULD LEAVE THE EU ON MARCH 29 WITHOUT A DEAL, A SCENARIO THAT BUSINESS LEADERS WARN WOULD BRING CHAOS TO MARKETS GLOBALLY.

SUNDAY\u2019S CRASH OCCURRED FIVE MONTHS AFTER THE SAME MODEL OF THE PLANE WENT DOWN IN INDONESIA, AN ACCIDENT THAT PROMPTED A STRING OF U.S. LAWSUITS AGAINST BOEING BY FAMILIES OF THE 189 VICTIMS.  WHILE NO LAWSUITS HAVE YET BEEN FILED SINCE THE CRASH OF ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 302, SOME PLAINTIFFS\u2019 LAWYERS SAID THEY EXPECT THAT BOEING WILL BE SUED IN THE UNITED STATES.  BOEING DID NOT IMMEDIATELY COMMENT.  THE COMPANY, WHICH HAS ITS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IN CHICAGO, HAS OFTEN CONVINCED U.S. JUDGES TO DISMISS AIR CRASH CASES IN FAVOR OF LITIGATION IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THE EVIDENCE AND WITNESSES ARE, USUALLY WHERE THE CRASH OCCURRED.  THAT ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO AVOID U.S. JURIES, WHICH CAN AWARD HEFTY PUNITIVE DAMAGES TO ACCIDENT VICTIMS FOR WRONGFUL DEATH, EMOTIONAL SUFFERING AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS OF SURVIVING FAMILY.  BOEING MAY HAVE A TOUGHER TIME WITH THAT STRATEGY AFTER THE ETHIOPIAN CRASH, SOME LEGAL EXPERTS SAID.  THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE EIGHT U.S. CITIZENS DIED AND BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS COULD ARGUE THAT LIABILITY HINGES ON SYSTEM DESIGN AND SAFETY DECISIONS MADE BY BOEING EXECUTIVES SINCE THE LION AIR CRASH IN INDONESIA.  \u201cNOW WITH TWO CRASHES WITH A BRAND-NEW AIRCRAFT, WHAT BOEING DID IN THE INTERVENING FIVE MONTHS IS MORE RELEVANT, AND THAT ALL HAPPENED IN THE UNITED STATES,\u201d SAID DANIEL ROSE, A LAWYER WITH KREINDLER & KREINDLER, A FIRM THAT REPRESENTS AIR CRASH VICTIMS AND THEIR RELATIVES.  THE CAUSES ARE STILL UNKNOWN, BUT BOTH INVOLVED A RELATIVELY NEW 737 MAX 8 AIRCRAFT THAT CRASHED WITHIN MINUTES OF TAKEOFF AND EXPERIENCED SUDDEN DROPS IN ALTITUDE WHEN THE AIRCRAFTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN STEADILY CLIMBING.  THIS HAS RAISED FRESH QUESTIONS AMONG REGULATORS ABOUT A DIGITAL ANTI-STALL SYSTEM KNOWN AS MANEUVERING CHARACTERISTICS AUGMENTATION SYSTEM, OR MCAS, DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE MAX TO OFFSET THE EXTRA LIFT FROM LARGER ENGINES MOUNTED ON ITS LOW-SLUNG FRAME.  IN A MARCH 4 COURT FILING IN LITIGATION OVER THE INDONESIA CRASH, BOEING ASKED THE JUDGE TO LIMIT ALL DISCOVERY IN THE CASE TO ISSUES OF FORUM, OR WHICH COUNTRY THE CASED BELONGED, AND SAID IT PLANNED TO FILE A MOTION TO DISMISS THE LAWSUIT.  LIABILITY  WHILE POTENTIAL PLAINTIFFS MAY NAME ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES AS A DEFENDANT IN ANY LAWSUITS, THE FOCUS ON THE 737 MAX 8 ANTI-STALL SYSTEM MAKES BOEING A LIKELY TARGET OF LITIGATION, SOME LAWYERS SAID.  ARTHUR WOLK, AN ATTORNEY WHO REPRESENTS PLAINTIFFS IN AIR CRASH LITIGATION AND SAID HE HAS BEEN CONTACTED BY A POTENTIAL PLAINTIFF OVER THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH, SAID BOEING WOULD LIKELY FACE CLAIMS FOR STRICT LIABILITY. THAT MEANS THEY COULD FACE AN ALLEGATION OF HAVING SOLD A PRODUCT THAT WAS INHERENTLY DEFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS.  PLAINTIFFS WILL ALSO CLAIM BOEING FAILED TO EXERCISE REASONABLE CARE IN DESIGNING PLANES OR FAILED TO INFORM FLIGHT CREWS ABOUT HOW THE PLANES OPERATE, WOLK SAID.  ROSE, THE LAWYER FOR PASSENGERS, SAID TWO ACCIDENTS SO CLOSE TOGETHER WILL PUT THE FOCUS OF ANY LAWSUITS ON THE ETHIOPIAN CRASH ON HOW BOEING TRIED TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS WITH ITS MCAS SYSTEM AFTER THE LION AIR CRASH.  \u201cWERE THERE OTHER EFFORTS BY BOEING TO ESSENTIALLY MINIMIZE THE PROBLEM OR HIDE THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM?\u201d ROSE ASKED. IF LAWYERS CAN SHOW BOEING MANAGEMENT ACTED RECKLESSLY, IT COULD CLEAR THE WAY FOR SUBSTANTIAL PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HE SAID.  SOME LAWYERS WHO HAVE WORKED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF SUCH CASES ARE LESS SURE ABOUT BOEING\u2019S POTENTIAL LIABILITY.  KENNETH QUINN, A LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS AIRLINES AND MANUFACTURERS, SAID HE THOUGHT BOEING HAD A GOOD CHANCE OF GETTING BOTH SETS OF U.S. CASES DISMISSED ON FORUM GROUNDS.  HE SAID THE TREND IN U.S. COURTS WAS IN BOEING\u2019S FAVOR.  \u201cINCREASINGLY, ATTEMPTS TO LITIGATE FOREIGN CRASHES INVOLVING FOREIGN AIRLINES ON FOREIGN SOIL ARE BEING DISMISSED,\u201d HE SAID.  IN NOVEMBER, A FEDERAL JUDGE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. DISMISSED A CASE AGAINST BOEING AND OTHER DEFENDANTS STEMMING FROM THE DISAPPEARANCE OF A MALAYSIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT IN 2014 BECAUSE THE PRESUMED CRASH HAD A STRONGER CONNECTION TO MALAYSIA THAN THE UNITED STATES.  IN 2011, A FEDERAL JUDGE IN LOS ANGELES DISMISSED 116 WRONGFUL DEATH AND PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES AGAINST BOEING OVER THE 2008 CRASH OF A SPANAIR JET ON A DOMESTIC FLIGHT IN SPAIN, WHERE THE JUDGE DETERMINED THE CASES SHOULD BE HEARD.

FILE PHOTO: AN AERIAL PHOTO SHOWS BOEING AIRPLANES, MANY OF WHICH ARE GROUNDED 737 MAX AIRCRAFT, AT BOEING FIELD IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, U.S. MARCH 21, 2019. REUTERS/LINDSEY WASSON  THE EUROPEAN UNION SAID THE WTO APPEAL RULING HAD VINDICATED ITS CLAIMS THAT BOEING CONTINUED TO RECEIVE ILLEGAL SUBSIDIES, BUT THE UNITED STATES SAID ONLY ONE MEASURE, A WASHINGTON STATE TAX BREAK WORTH AROUND $100 MILLION ANNUALLY, HAD BEEN FOUND STILL TO VIOLATE THE RULES.  THE TRADE POWERS HAVE BEEN BATTLING SINCE 2004 OVER MUTUAL CLAIMS OF ILLEGAL AID TO PLANE GIANTS BOEING AND AIRBUS, WITH PARALLEL CASES GENERATING THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF FINDINGS AND DENSE LITIGATION THAT PUT A BURDEN ON THE ALREADY CONGESTED WTO.  BOTH SIDES HAVE BEEN CAUGHT PAYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF SUBSIDIES TO GAIN ADVANTAGE IN THE GLOBAL JET BUSINESS, AND ASKED TO STOP OR FACE POTENTIAL SANCTIONS. THURSDAY\u2019S APPEAL RULING SHOWED THAT THE UNITED STATES DID NOT STOP ALL SUBSIDIES WHEN ASKED TO DO SO, ECHOING AN EARLIER FINDING AGAINST THE EU.  THE WTO\u2019S APPELLATE BODY, EFFECTIVELY THE SUPREME COURT OF WORLD TRADE, RULED THAT THE BUSINESS AND OCCUPANCY (B&O) TAX RATE REDUCTION IN WASHINGTON STATE HAD SIGNIFICANTLY CUT AIRBUS SALES IN FIVE PARTICULARLY PRICE-SENSITIVE SALES CAMPAIGNS.  \u201cTHE APPELLATE BODY HAS NOW SETTLED THIS CASE DEFINITIVELY, CONFIRMING OUR VIEW THE U.S. HAS CONTINUED TO SUBSIDIZE BOEING DESPITE WTO RULINGS TO THE CONTRARY,\u201d EUROPEAN TRADE COMMISSIONER CECILIA MALMSTROM SAID IN A STATEMENT.  BUT U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE ROBERT LIGHTHIZER CALLED THE RULING A VICTORY FOR THE UNITED STATES, SINCE THE WTO HAD FOUND ONLY ONE ILLEGAL SUBSIDY WHILE UPHOLDING AN EARLIER REJECTION OF EU CLAIMS THAT BOEING\u2019S COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS RECEIVED OVER $10 BILLION IN ILLEGAL U.S. SUBSIDIES.  \u201cTHIS REPORT CONFIRMS WHAT EVERY OTHER WTO REPORT ON THESE ISSUES HAS FOUND: THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT EVEN REMOTELY COMPARABLE TO THE EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE AND HARMFUL EU SUBSIDIES TO AIRBUS,\u201d LIGHTHIZER SAID IN A STATEMENT.  BOEING SAID IT WOULD SUPPORT THE NEW DECISION.  ANY SANCTIONS COULD BROADLY TARGET INDUSTRIES BEYOND AEROSPACE, BUT THE IMPACT OF THE RECORD TRADE DISPUTE ON BOEING AND AIRBUS THEMSELVES HAS SO FAR BEEN MODEST.  ANALYSTS HAVE LONG PREDICTED THE CASE WOULD PETER OUT OR BE SETTLED WITHOUT A TRADE WAR, BUT THE PROSPECT OF RETALIATION IS GRABBING MORE ATTENTION THAN BEFORE AMID GLOBAL TRADE TENSIONS.  COUNTERMEASURES  AIRBUS SAID BOEING STILL RECEIVED A RAFT OF SUPPORT AND URGED THE UNITED STATES TO NEGOTIATE A \u201cFAIR-TRADE ENVIRONMENT\u201d - A SETTLEMENT PROPOSAL THAT WASHINGTON HAS SO FAR REJECTED.  IN A TECHNICAL POINT, IT SAID THE WTO HAD RESURRECTED A WIDER GROUP OF U.S. SUBSIDIES WHICH COULD BE CHALLENGED LATER.  BUT BOEING SAID THE SLATE HAD NOW BEEN WIPED CLEAN OF ANY UNLAWFUL SUBSIDIES IN THE UNITED STATES, EXCEPT FOR THE WASHINGTON STATE MEASURE WHICH IT AGREED WOULD NOW BE AMENDED.  \u201cWE TRUST THAT OUR EXAMPLE WILL PROMPT AIRBUS AND THE EUROPEAN UNION TO IMMEDIATELY BRING THEMSELVES INTO FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE SUBSTANTIAL RULINGS AGAINST THESE PARTIES BY THE WTO,\u201d BOEING SAID IN A STATEMENT.

THAT PART OF THE ROW SIMMERS ON AS AIRBUS ARGUES THE CASE AGAINST EUROPEAN GOVERNMENT LOANS FOR THE A380 NO LONGER COUNTS BECAUSE OF ITS PLANS TO SHUT PRODUCTION. THE UNITED STATES SAYS THE PARTLY UNPAID LOANS CONTINUE TO DAMAGE BOEING INDIRECTLY.

THE ADJUSTMENT PUSHED THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST PLANEMAKER BEHIND EUROPEAN RIVAL AIRBUS IN THE RACE FOR BUSINESS THIS YEAR AS BOTH COMPANIES GRAPPLED WITH CANCELLATIONS THAT OUTWEIGHED NEW ORDERS IN THE FIRST QUARTER.  UNDER RECENT CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING RULES, BOEING HIVES OFF ORDERS THAT NO LONGER MEET ITS CRITERIA FOR RECOGNISING REVENUE INTO A SEPARATE CATEGORY, WHILE DEFENDING CONTRACTUAL CLAIMS.  AS A RESULT, BOEING NET ORDERS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER SLID INTO NEGATIVE TERRITORY, WITH A TOTAL OF MINUS 119 NET ORDERS AFTER CANCELLATIONS, DESPITE A SLEW OF NEW WIDE-BODY SALES.  AIRBUS POSTED A NEGATIVE TOTAL OF 58 NET ORDERS OVER THE SAME PERIOD.  BOEING FINANCE DIRECTOR GREG SMITH CONFIRMED THE ADJUSTMENT WAS RELATED TO FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AT JET AIRWAYS, WHICH HALTED ALL FLIGHT OPERATIONS INDEFINITELY ON APRIL 17 AFTER ITS LENDERS REJECTED A PLEA FOR EMERGENCY FUNDS.  REUTERS REPORTED EARLIER ON WEDNESDAY THAT BOEING\u2019S ORDER ADJUSTMENT, WHICH INITIALLY EMERGED ON A ROUTINE WEB PAGE FOR ORDERS AND DELIVERIES, CAME AFTER JET AIRWAYS STOPPED FLYING.  BOEING ALSO POSTED A FIRST-QUARTER OPERATIONAL LOSS OF $707 MILLION IN A SPECIFIC CATEGORY GROUPING TOGETHER CERTAIN UNALLOCATED ITEMS, COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $326 MILLION A YEAR EARLIER. OVERALL, IT POSTED A $2.35 BILLION OPERATING PROFIT.  \u201cTHE CHANGE IN EARNINGS FROM OTHER UNALLOCATED ITEMS AND ELIMINATIONS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A CUSTOMER FINANCING IMPAIRMENT, HIGHER DEFERRED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND INCREASED ENTERPRISE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT,\u201d BOEING SAID.

THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY\u2019S BIGGEST ANNUAL EVENT, WHICH ALTERNATES WITH BRITAIN\u2019S FARNBOROUGH AIRSHOW, IS TRADITIONALLY A SLUGGING MATCH BETWEEN AIRBUS AND BOEING IN THE $150 BILLION A YEAR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT MARKET.  BUT THIS YEAR BOEING IS STILL GRAPPLING WITH THE GROUNDING OF ITS TOP-SELLING 737 MAX AIRCRAFT IN MARCH AFTER TWO DEADLY CRASHES, WHILE EUROPEAN ARCH-RIVAL AIRBUS IS DEALING WITH THE FALLOUT FROM A LONG-RUNNING CORRUPTION SCANDAL.  AIRBUS USED THE SHOW TO LAUNCH A LONG-RANGE VERSION OF ITS A321NEO JET, AIMING TO CARVE OUT NEW ROUTES FOR AIRLINES WITH SMALLER PLANES AND STEAL A MARCH ON BOEING\u2019S OWNS PLANS FOR ANOTHER POTENTIAL ALL-NEW JET, THE NMA.  \u201cWE CAN FLY FROM NORTH-EASTERN ASIA INTO SOUTH ASIA, FROM THE MIDDLE EAST TO BALI OR FROM JAPAN DEEP INTO AUSTRALIA, AND SO ON,\u201d AIRBUS CHIEF SALESMAN CHRISTIAN SCHERER SAID.  \u201cIT IS THEREFORE THE LOWEST-RISK INVESTMENT FOR AIRLINES ON THESE KINDS OF ROUTES.\u201d  LEASING COMPANY AIR LEASE CORP BECAME THE FIRST CUSTOMER OF THE NEW AIRCRAFT - THE A321XLR - LINING UP FOR 27 AS PART OF A DEAL FOR 100 AIRBUS PLANES.  SOURCES FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER SAID AIRBUS WAS TRYING TO ASSEMBLE CLOSE TO 200 ORDERS OR CONVERSIONS TO THE NEW MODEL AS IT CHASES DEALS WITH CARRIERS INCLUDING AMERICAN AIRLINES, JETBLUE, CEBU AIR AND FRONTIER AIRLINES OWNER INDIGO PARTNERS.  DESPITE A FLURRY OF DELEGATES DASHING IN GOLF CARTS BETWEEN PARKED JETLINERS, MISSILES AND SPY PLANES, THIS YEAR\u2019S GATHERING APPEARED RELATIVELY SUBDUED, WITH A PROFIT WARNING FROM LUFTHANSA ADDING TO TRADE TENSIONS AND SLOWING ECONOMIES.

ANALYSTS EXPECT ANYTHING FROM 400 TO 800 COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ORDERS AND COMMITMENTS AT THE SHOW, COMPARED WITH 959 AT FARNBOROUGH LAST YEAR, THOUGH IT CAN BE HARD TO IDENTIFY TRULY NEW BUSINESS AGAINST FIRMED-UP COMMITMENTS AND SWITCHED MODELS.  BOEING COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES BOSS KEVIN MCALLISTER SAID IT WAS PREMATURE TO PREDICT ANY DELAYS TO THE 777X PROGRAM. THE PLANEMAKER IS TARGETING A MAIDEN FLIGHT THIS YEAR AND ENTRY INTO SERVICE THE NEXT.  GULF AIRLINE EMIRATES HAS SAID IT EXPECTS THE FIRST PLANE IN JUNE 2020.

(FOR A GRAPHIC ON 'AIRBUS, BOEING, RAYTHEON, UTC SHARES' CLICK TMSNRT.RS/2IP8DVJ)  SIZE VS COMFORT  THE AIRBUS A321XLR WILL BE THE LONGEST-RANGE NARROW-BODY JETLINER AND ARRIVES AS AIRLINES LOOK TO MAXIMIZE THE FLEXIBILITY OF MORE FUEL-EFFICIENT, SINGLE-AISLE AIRCRAFT.  ITS RANGE OF UP TO 4,700 NAUTICAL MILES - ABOUT 15% MORE THAN THE PREVIOUS A321LR - WILL LEAPFROG THE OUT-OF-PRODUCTION BOEING 757 AND NUDGES IT INTO THE LONG-JUMP CATEGORY OCCUPIED BY MORE COSTLY WIDE-BODY JETS.  THE A321XLR ALSO EATS INTO A RANGE CATEGORY TARGETED BY THE POSSIBLE NMA MID-MARKET, TWIN-AISLE JET UNDER REVIEW BY BOEING.  \u201cIT DOES PROVIDE A VERY EFFECTIVE AIRPLANE FOR MANY OF THE SAME ROUTES AS THE NMA, AND IT DOES SO MANY YEARS EARLIER,\u201d AIR LEASE CEO JOHN PLUEGER SAID OF THE NEW AIRBUS JET.  BUT THERE IS A DEBATE OVER WHETHER PASSENGERS WILL ENJOY FLYING LONGER DISTANCES IN MEDIUM-HAUL PLANES.  AIRBUS DID NOT GIVE A PRICE FOR THE A321XLR. THE CURRENT A321NEO HAS A LIST PRICE OF $129.5 MILLION.  BOEING CHAIRMAN AND CEO DENNIS MUILENBURG ON SUNDAY SAID THE A321XLR WOULD ONLY \u201cSCRATCH AN EDGE\u201d OF THE MARKET SEGMENT TARGETED BY THE NMA. BUT AIR LEASE FOUNDER STEVEN UDVAR-HAZY, A DOYEN OF THE LEASING INDUSTRY, SAID THE NMA PROJECT REMAINED \u201cA LITTLE BIT IN COLD STORAGE\u201d AS LONG AS THE MAX GROUNDING LASTED.  HE ADDED THAT BOEING EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE ORDERS FOR WIDE-BODY JETS AT THE PARIS SHOW BUT ITS MAIN FOCUS AT THE EVENT WAS SAFETY, WITH EXECUTIVES TAKING TURNS TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE MAX CRASHES IN INDONESIA AND ETHIOPIA THAT KILLED 346 PEOPLE.  \u201cTHIS IS THE MOST TRYING OF TIMES,\u201d BOEING\u2019S MCALLISTER TOLD A PRESS BRIEFING.  \u201cBUT WITHOUT A DOUBT THIS IS A PIVOTAL MOMENT FOR ALL OF US.

BOEING LOST TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MARKET CAPITALIZATION AFTER ITS 737 MAX PLANES WERE GROUNDED, MAKING IT AN ATTRACTIVE TARGET FOR SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION.  THE BOEING LEADERSHIP FIGHT, HOWEVER, IS UNUSUAL - BOTH IN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE LOSSES CLAIMED BY THE NEVADA FAMILY AND THE FEROCITY OF BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ\u2019S INVESTIGATION OF THE FAMILY\u2019S CLAIMS.  KAHN SWICK\u2019S CLIENTS - KENNETH AND KATHLEEN WANG AND THEIR ADULT SON, KENNETH WANG JR - CERTIFIED IN A FILING IN FEDERAL COURT IN CHICAGO THAT THEY PURCHASED MORE THAN $40 MILLION IN BOEING STOCK IN THE MONTHS PRECEDING THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH AND THE GROUNDING OF 737 MAX PLANES. WANG FAMILY MEMBERS SOMETIMES PURCHASED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS\u2019 WORTH OF SHARES IN A SINGLE DAY. THE FAMILY ALLEGES THAT THE VALUE OF ITS STAKE DROPPED BY $4.7 MILLION AS THE MARKET RESPONDED TO BAD NEWS ABOUT THE 737 MAX JETS.  BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ SAYS THE WANGS\u2019 CERTIFICATION DOES NOT INDICATE SALES OF BOEING SHARES \u2013 AN \u201cUNUSUAL\u201d TRADING PATTERN, GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE WANGS\u2019 INVESTMENT. ACCORDING TO BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ\u2019S ANALYSIS, THE WANGS CLAIM TO HAVE BOUGHT MORE BOEING SHARES AND LOST MORE MONEY THAN CHARLES SCHWAB, TD ASSET MANAGEMENT AND OPPENHEIMER, WHICH COLLECTIVELY MANAGE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  DESPITE BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ\u2019S SUSPICIONS ABOUT THE WANGS\u2019 TRADING, THE FIRM INITIALLY ATTEMPTED TO TEAM UP WITH THE FAMILY, SUGGESTING THAT THE WANGS AND MISSPERS MOVE JOINTLY TO LEAD THE BOEING CASE.(SEVERAL OTHER INVESTORS, INCLUDING A CANADIAN PENSION FUND, HAVE ALSO ASKED TO BE APPOINTED LEAD PLAINTIFFS, THOUGH NONE HAVE LOSSES AS LARGE AS EITHER THE WANGS OR MISSPERS.)  WHEN KAHN SWICK AND THE WANGS TURNED DOWN BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ\u2019S INVITATION TO JOIN FORCES, KAHN SWICK SAID BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ BROUGHT IN A TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS TO VET THE WANGS\u2019 CLAIMS. INVESTIGATORS RAN DOWN THE WANGS\u2019 FINANCIAL RECORDS IN THE U.S. AND CHINA, WHICH ISN\u2019T OUT OF THE ORDINARY IN SECURITIES CLASS ACTIONS.  BUT ACCORDING TO KAHN SWICK\u2019S FILINGS, BERNSTEIN DIDN\u2019T STOP THERE. INVESTIGATORS HIRED BY THE FIRM PARKED OUTSIDE THE WANG RESIDENCES AND MADE \u201cREPEATED PHONE CALLS TO THEIR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES, WORK COLLEAGUES, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS,\u201d PROBING FOR INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THE APPARENTLY MODEST FAMILY COULD HAVE AMASSED A $40 MILLION INVESTMENT IN BOEING. BERNSTEIN INVESTIGATORS CALLED KENNY WANG\u2019S BOSS AT THE PEST CONTROL COMPANY AND HIS GIRLFRIEND\u2019S SISTER. THEY EVEN, ACCORDING TO KAHN SWICK, ENTERED THE HOME OF ONE OF KATHLEEN WANG\u2019S NEIGHBORS FOR AN INTERVIEW IN PERSON.  KAHN SWICK FILED A MOTION TO CURTAIL BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ\u2019S INVESTIGATION. U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE JOHN THARP OF CHICAGO DENIED THAT MOTION ON JULY 3, RULING THAT BOTH SIDES SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE PROPRIETY OF THE INVESTIGATION. THE WANGS' LAWYERS ALSO WENT TO NEVADA STATE COURT TO ASK FOR AN ORDER OF PROTECTION AGAINST BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ INVESTIGATORS. THAT MOTION IS SCHEDULED FOR A HEARING NEXT WEEK.  BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ SUGGESTED IN THE BRIEF IT FILED FRIDAY THAT THE INVESTIGATION VINDICATED ITS SUSPICIONS ABOUT THE WANGS\u2019 REPORTED BOEING INVESTMENT. KATHLEEN AND KENNETH WANG, SR, APPEAR TO HAVE NO PROPERTY EXCEPT FOR A HOME VALUED AT ABOUT $685,000 AND TWO CARS WORTH ABOUT $30,000. KENNETH WANG JR HAS A $385,000 HOUSE AND TWO CARS, THE FIRM SAID. HE AND HIS MOTHER BOTH APPEAR TO EARN ABOUT $60,000 A YEAR AT THEIR JOBS, ACCORDING TO THE BRIEF.  THE OWNER OF THE PEST CONTROL COMPANY WHERE THE SON IS EMPLOYED, WHO DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS A LONGTIME FAMILY FRIEND, TOLD BERNSTEIN INVESTIGATORS THERE WAS NO WAY THE WANGS HAD INVESTED $40 MILLION. HE DESCRIBED THE WANGS AS \u201cREGULAR WORKING PEOPLE\u201d AND CALLED THE ASSERTION THAT THEY HAD TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INVESTMENTS \u201cWRONG\u201d AND \u201cA LIE,\u201d ACCORDING TO THE BERNSTEIN BRIEF.  BERNSTEIN SAID THAT IN A CASE AS IMPORTANT AS THE BOEING SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION, JUDGE THARP CANNOT APPOINT LEAD INVESTORS WITH A CLOUD OVER THEIR HEADS. KAHN SWICK RESPONDED THAT IF THE JUDGE HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WANGS\u2019 TRADES, THE FAMILY WILL SHOW THE JUDGE BACKUP DOCUMENTS DETAILING THE TRANSACTIONS, EVEN THOUGH SUCH BACKUP IS NOT NECESSARY UNDER THE GUIDELINES FOR SECURITIES SUITS.  THE OTHER INVESTORS BIDDING TO LEAD THE CASE SEEM TO BE HOPING JUDGE THARP DECIDES THAT BOTH THE WANGS AND MISSPERS ARE TOO COMPROMISED TO REPRESENT ALL BOEING INVESTORS. THE NEXT ROUND OF BRIEFS IS DUE ON AUG. 2.

THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) IS EXPECTED TO GIVE THE GREEN LIGHT THIS WEEK TO U.S. TARIFFS ON BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF EUROPEAN GOODS, INCLUDING AIRBUS JETS, IN A MOVE LIKELY TO BE MIRRORED BY EUROPEAN TARIFFS ON U.S. PLANES AND GOODS NEXT YEAR.  \u201cTHE U.S. CAN\u2019T AFFORD TO HAVE A TRADE WAR,\u201d RYANAIR GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE MICHAEL O\u2019LEARY, WHOSE COMPANY\u2019S MAIN AIRLINE IS ONE OF BOEING\u2019S (BA.N) LARGEST CUSTOMERS, TOLD REUTERS AFTER SPEAKING AT A REUTERS NEWSMAKER EVENT.  \u201cBOEING IS ONE OF ITS BIGGEST MANUFACTURERS AND BIGGEST EXPORTERS, BUT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED SO I THINK LIKE MOST AIRLINES WE SIT THERE AND HOPE COMMON SENSE WILL PREVAIL AT THE END OF THE DAY, BUT WE DON\u2019T KNOW HOW IT PLAYS OUT,\u201d O\u2019LEARY SAID.

THE SUBPOENAS WILL BE ISSUED OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS, THE LAWYERS SEPARATELY TOLD REUTERS.  THE LAWYERS WANT TO KNOW WHAT BOEING CO PROMISED POTENTIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS ABOUT FLIGHT CREW TRAINING AND THE 737 MAX CERTIFICATION PROCESS, AND ITS COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE TWO AIRLINES FOLLOWING A LION AIR CRASH IN INDONESIA ON OCT. 29, 2018, AND BEFORE THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH ON MARCH 10.  THEY ARE SEEKING DOCUMENTS ABOUT 737 MAX SOFTWARE KNOWN AS MCAS WIDELY LINKED TO BOTH DEADLY CRASHES, AS WELL AS INFORMATION ON THE AIRCRAFT\u2019S SENSORS.  THE TWO CRASHES, BOTH INVOLVING 737 MAX JETS, KILLED 346 PEOPLE AND SPURRED MORE THAN 100 LAWSUITS AGAINST THE CHICAGO-BASED PLANEMAKER.  SOUTHWEST AND AMERICAN DID NOT IMMEDIATELY COMMENT OUTSIDE NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS.  THE 737 MAX WAS GROUNDED GLOBALLY FOLLOWING THE ETHIOPIAN CRASH IN MARCH, AND BOEING HAS BEEN WORKING TO DELIVER SOFTWARE FIXES AIMED AT WINNING FRESH APPROVAL FOR COMMERCIAL FLIGHT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. SOUTHWEST AND AMERICAN HAVE EACH CANCELED MORE THAN 100 DAILY FLIGHTS.  WHILE FAMILIES OF THE LION AIR CRASH VICTIMS ARE IN SETTLEMENT TALKS WITH BOEING, THE ETHIOPIAN CRASH VICTIMS ARE PURSUING A JURY TRIAL.  BOTH CASES ARE IN CHICAGO FEDERAL COURT, WHERE A LION AIR STATUS HEARING IS TAKING PLACE ON THURSDAY.  IN A COURT FILING LATE MONDAY, BOEING SAID VETERAN LITIGATOR DAN WEBB, A HIGH-PROFILE CHICAGO LAWYER AND FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, HAD JOINED ITS LEGAL TEAM IN THE LION AIR CASE.  IN ADDITION TO THE CHICAGO CASES, QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW BOEING DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED THE 737 MAX ARE A FOCUS IN PROBES BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE.  THE PLANEMAKER HAS SAID IT WAS SORRY FOR THE LIVES LOST IN BOTH CRASHES BUT STOPPED SHORT OF ADMITTING LIABILITY IN HOW IT DEVELOPED THE 737 MAX OR THE FLIGHT CONTROL SOFTWARE.

INDONESIAN AIR ACCIDENT INVESTIGATOR NURCAHYO UTOMO HOLDS A PLANE MODEL DURING A NEWS CONFERENCE TO RELEASE THE FINAL REPORT TO THE LION AIR FLIGHT JT 610 CRASH IN JAKARTA, INDONESIA OCTOBER 25, 2019. REUTERS/ADI KURNIAWAN  INVESTIGATORS PINPOINT MULTIPLE FLAWS IN THE DESIGN AND APPROVAL OF THE SOFTWARE WHILE NOTING THE CAPTAIN WAS SICK AND THE CO-PILOT WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH EMERGENCY COCKPIT PROCEDURES.  FOLLOWING ARE EXCERPTS OF A SUMMARY FROM THE COCKPIT VOICE RECORDING FROM THE OCT 29, 2018, CRASH RECOVERED BY NAVY DIVERS IN JANUARY.  OCT 29, 5:18 A.M.  WHILE STILL ON THE GROUND, THE CO-PILOT INFORMS THE CAPTAIN THAT THIS IS NOT HIS USUAL SCHEDULE AND THAT HE WAS CALLED AT 4 A.M. THAT MORNING AND TOLD HE WOULD BE ON THE FLIGHT.  THE CAPTAIN SAYS HE IS SUFFERING FROM THE FLU AND IS RECORDED COUGHING ABOUT 15 TIMES DURING THE PRE-FLIGHT.  A LION AIR ENGINEER COMES TO THE COCKPIT AND TELLS THE CAPTAIN HE WILL BE ON BOARD, BUT HAS NOT BEEN TRAINED FOR THE BOEING 737 MAX 8.  THE 181 PASSENGERS AND SEVEN CREW ARE NOW ALL ON BOARD AND THE AIRCRAFT IS READY TO TAXI.  THE CAPTAIN IS AT THE CONTROLS AND THE CO-PILOT IS HANDLING THE RADIO AND SPEAKING TO GROUND CONTROL. JAKARTA TOWER ISSUES TAKEOFF CLEARANCE AND THE PLANE LEAVES THE RUNWAY AT 6:20:33 A.M.  TWO SECONDS LATER, THE STICK SHAKER OR STALL ALARM STARTS VIBRATING ON THE LEFT SIDE WHERE THE CAPTAIN SITS. A FAULTY ANGLE OF ATTACK (AOA) SENSOR IS FEEDING FALSE DATA TO A FLIGHT COMPUTER, WHICH THINKS THE PLANE IS IN DANGER OF LOSING LIFT.  THE CAPTAIN IS RECORDED AS \u201cEXCLAIMING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE AIRCRAFT\u201d, WHILE THE CO-PILOT TELLS HIM THERE IS ALSO A PROBLEM OF INCONSISTENT AIRSPEED READINGS.  THE CO-PILOT MAKES A SIMILAR EXCLAMATION AND ASKS THE CAPTAIN, WHO DOES NOT RESPOND, IF HE WANTS TO RETURN.  AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER CLEARS THE PILOTS TO CLIMB TO 27,000 FEET. NOW THE COCKPIT\u2019S ALTITUDE READINGS ARE DESCRIBED AS INCONSISTENT.  THE CO-PILOT ASKS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL FOR THE READING ON THE RADAR DISPLAY AND IS TOLD THEY\u2019RE AT 900 FEET AS THE AIRCRAFT WAS CLIMBING.  THE CO-PILOT IS ASKED BY THE CAPTAIN TO RUN A MEMORY CHECKLIST, THE MOST URGENT TYPE OF PROBLEM-SOLVING PROCEDURE WHICH PILOTS MUST KNOW BY HEART, FOR UNRELIABLE AIRSPEED VALUES. THERE IS NO RECORD IN THE TRANSCRIPT OF HIM DOING THIS.  UNSURE WHAT ALTITUDE TO REQUEST FROM CONTROLLERS, HE IS TOLD BY THE CAPTAIN TO \u201cREQUEST UUH..PROCEED\u201d.  ASKED BY AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TO DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM, THE CO-PILOT REPLIES THEY\u2019RE EXPERIENCING \u201cFLIGHT CONTROL PROBLEMS\u201d.  MEMORY ITEM  THE CAPTAIN BRIEFLY HANDS CONTROL TO THE CO-PILOT, WHILE AIR CONTROL WARNS THE FLIGHT HAS DESCENDED TO \u201cONE SEVEN HUNDRED\u201d (1,700 FEET) AND ASKS FOR THE INTENDED ALTITUDE.  THE CAPTAIN REQUESTS 5,000 FEET, WHICH THE CO-PILOT RADIOS TO CONTROL.  THE CONTROLLER INSTRUCTS THE PILOTS TO CLIMB AND TURN NORTHEAST. AN AUTOMATED COCKPIT VOICE ALERT WARNS THE CREW TO WATCH THE BANK, OR TURNING ANGLE.  THE CAPTAIN AGAIN CALLS FOR A \u201cMEMORY ITEM\u201d, BUT DOES NOT SAY WHICH MENTAL CHECKLIST HE IS REFERRING TO. ASKED TO EXPLAIN, HE REPLIES, \u201cCHECK\u201d.  SEVENTEEN SECONDS LATER THE CO-PILOT WARNS \u201cFLIGHT CONTROL,\u201d TO WHICH THE CAPTAIN RESPONDS \u201cYEAH\u201d.  JUST AFTER THREE MINUTES INTO THE FIGHT, AND AGAIN LATER, THE SOUND OF PAGES BEING TURNED IS PICKED UP ON THE COCKPIT RECORDING FOLLOWED BY THE SOUND OF THE TRIM WHEEL - A MANUAL OVERRIDE LINKED TO THE TRIM SYSTEM CONTROLLED BY MCAS.  THE TRANSCRIPT SUGGESTS GROWING STRESS AND MORE FRAGMENTED COMMUNICATIONS, COUPLED WITH CONFUSION ABOUT WHICH CHECKLIST TO USE.  THE CO-PILOT SEARCHES INCREASINGLY FRANTICALLY FOR AN UNRELIABLE AIRSPEED CHECKLIST - \u201cWHERE IS THE?....NO AIRSPEED,\u201d AND MOMENTS LATER, \u201cAIRSPEED, AIRSPEED\u201d FOLLOWED BY MORE PAGES.  THE CAPTAIN ASKS A FLIGHT ATTENDANT TO CALL THE OFF-DUTY ENGINEER WHO IS TRAVELING ON THE PLANE. THE MICROPHONE PICKS UP REPEATED CHIMES SIGNALING CALLS BETWEEN FLIGHT ATTENDANTS.  THE DOOR OPENS AND THE CAPTAIN IS HEARD ASKING SOMEONE TO LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE COMPUTER, WHOSE MCAS SOFTWARE - WHICH THE REPORT CONFIRMS WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE MANUALS -CONTINUES TO PUSH THE NOSE DOWN USING THE PLANE\u2019S TRIM SYSTEM.  \u201cOK, WE ARE ALREADY GEAR UP 5,000,\u201d ADVISES THE CO-PILOT. A SOUND SIMILAR TO AN ALTITUDE ALERT RINGS OUT. \u201cFLY UP,\u201d THE CO-PILOT URGES THE CAPTAIN.  CONTROLLERS ASK THE PILOTS WHETHER THE AIRCRAFT IS DESCENDING, AND THE CAPTAIN SAYS \u201cWE HAVE SOME PROBLEM\u201d. IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER HE SAYS THIS ON THE RADIO OR TO HIS COLLEAGUE.  THE CO-PILOT TELLS CONTROLLERS THEY ARE FLYING MANUALLY DUE TO THE FLIGHT CONTROL PROBLEM.  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL INSTRUCTS THE PILOTS TO PREPARE FOR LANDING AT ONE OF THE RUNWAYS.  THE CAPTAIN HANDS CONTROL OF THE PLANE TO THE CO-PILOT AND CONTACTS AIR CONTROL USING THE WRONG FLIGHT NUMBER IN A FURTHER SIGN OF THE GATHERING STRESS IN THE COCKPIT.  HE WARNS AIR CONTROL THAT THE ALTITUDE CANNOT BE DETERMINED DUE TO ALL THE INSTRUMENTS SHOWING DIFFERENT READINGS.  CONTROLLERS ASK WHAT ALTITUDE THE PILOTS WANT, AS THE FIRST OFFICER IS HEARD EXCLAIMING THAT THE AIRCRAFT IS FLYING DOWN.  THE CAPTAIN RESPONDS \u201cFIVE THOU\u201d (5,000 FEET) AND REPLIES \u201cIT\u2019S OK\u201d AS THE CO-PILOT AGAIN EXCLAIMS THE JET IS DESCENDING.  AN EXCESS SPEED WARNING SOUNDS.

WE KNOW WE MADE MISTAKES AND GOT SOME THINGS WRONG,\u201d MUILENBURG WILL TELL THE U.S. SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE.  THE TESTIMONY, WHICH WAS FIRST REPORTED BY REUTERS AND MADE PUBLIC LATER ON MONDAY, ADDED THAT THE COMPANY HAD MADE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE NOW-GROUNDED 737 MAX AIRPLANE \u201cTHAT WILL ENSURE THAT ACCIDENTS LIKE THESE NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.\u201d  MUILENBURG, WHO WAS STRIPPED OF HIS TITLE AS BOEING CHAIRMAN BY THE BOARD EARLIER THIS MONTH, WILL ALSO TESTIFY BEFORE THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE COMMITTEE ON WEDNESDAY.

MUILENBURG VISITED THE INDONESIAN EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON ON MONDAY TO MEET WITH THE COUNTRY\u2019S AMBASSADOR, OFFER CONDOLENCES AND PAY RESPECTS TO THOSE LOST ON THE FLIGHT, BOEING SAID IN A STATEMENT.

SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN ROGER WICKER TOLD REUTERS LAST WEEK THAT THE 737 MAX \u201cWON\u2019T FLY UNLESS 99.9% OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND AMERICAN POLICYMAKERS ARE CONVINCED THAT IT\u2019S ABSOLUTELY SAFE.\u201d  INDONESIAN INVESTIGATORS REPORTED ON FRIDAY THAT BOEING ACTING WITHOUT ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT FROM U.S. REGULATORS AND FAILED TO GRASP RISKS IN THE DESIGN OF COCKPIT SOFTWARE ON THE 737 MAX, SOWING THE SEEDS FOR LION AIR 610 THAT ALSO INVOLVED ERRORS BY AIRLINE WORKERS AND CREW.  \u2018LONGER THAN EXPECTED\u2019  MUILENBURG NOTED THAT BOTH CRASHES INVOLVED THE REPEATED ACTIVATION OF A FLIGHT CONTROL SOFTWARE FUNCTION KNOWN AS MCAS AFTER IT RECEIVED FAULTY SENSOR INPUT.  BOEING\u2019S DEVELOPMENT OF THAT SOFTWARE HAS COME UNDER CRITICISM IN REPORTS AND FROM LAWMAKERS AND THE COMPANY IS ADDING SAFEGUARDS TO THE SYSTEM. MUILENBURG SAID THE CHANGES WOULD \u201cELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF EVEN EXTREMELY UNLIKELY RISKS THAT ARE UNRELATED TO THE ACCIDENT.\u201d  BOEING HAS ADMITTED FEW MISTAKES SINCE THE TWO FATAL CRASHES. EARLIER THIS MONTH, THE FAA QUESTIONED WHY BOEING WITHHELD INSTANT MESSAGES FROM A FORMER PILOT FOR MONTHS THAT RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT MCAS.  IN MAY, BOEING ACKNOWLEDGED IT DID NOT TELL THE FAA FOR 13 MONTHS THAT IT INADVERTENTLY MADE AN ALARM ALERTING PILOTS TO A MISMATCH OF FLIGHT DATA OPTIONAL ON THE 737 MAX, INSTEAD OF STANDARD AS ON EARLIER 737S. THE COMPANY INSISTED THE MISSING DISPLAY REPRESENTED NO SAFETY RISK.  MUILENBURG ACKNOWLEDGED THAT GETTING THE PLANE IN THE AIR \u201cHAS TAKEN LONGER THAN WE ORIGINALLY EXPECTED, BUT WE\u2019RE COMMITTED TO GETTING IT RIGHT, AND RETURN-TO-SERVICE TIMING IS COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON ANSWERING EACH AND EVERY QUESTION FROM THE FAA.\u201d  HE ADDED THAT \u201cREGULATORS SHOULD APPROVE THE RETURN OF THE MAX TO THE SKIES ONLY AFTER THEY HAVE APPLIED THE MOST RIGOROUS SCRUTINY, AND ARE COMPLETELY SATISFIED AS TO THE PLANE\u2019S SAFETY.

THE CHICAGO-BASED PLANEMAKER HAS CONTINUED TO PRODUCE THE JET SINCE IT WAS GROUNDED IN MARCH IN THE WAKE OF TWO FATAL ACCIDENTS, AND IS EXPECTED TO SPEED DELIVERIES BY 40% TO 70 UNITS A MONTH WHEN ITS FACTORY DOORS REOPEN, IN A BID TO START CLEARING THE BACKLOG.  ROB MORRIS, GLOBAL HEAD OF CONSULTANCY AT UK-BASED ASCEND BY CIRIUM, SAID THE COMBINATION OF ANY RAPID REBOUND IN DELIVERIES, ECONOMIC WORRIES AND AN ACCUMULATION OF MARKET PRESSURES DATING BACK BEFORE THE CRASHES COULD MAKE IT HARD TO ABSORB THE JETS.  \u201cNEXT YEAR IS THE CHALLENGE.

FOR 2020, MEGGITT, WHICH MAKES AEROSPACE PARTS, SAID THAT ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH WOULD BE BETWEEN 2% AND 4%, TRAILING THE 8% RISE RECORDED LAST YEAR, WHILE UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT WOULD TAKE A 20 MILLION POUND ($26 MILLION) HIT FROM THE TWO FACTORS.  THE IMPACT WAS SPLIT EQUALLY, WITH 10 MILLION POUNDS FROM THE BOEING ISSUES AND 10 MILLION POUNDS FROM THE RAPID SPREAD OF THE COVID-19 VIRUS, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF THE DROP IN AIR TRAFFIC, MEGGITT CEO TONY WOOD SAID.

BOEING SHARES HAD GAINED MORE THAN 136% DURING HIS TERM THAT ABRUPTLY ENDED WITH HIS RESIGNATION ON DEC. 23.  THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK COULD HIT BOEING\u2019S CASH FLOW FURTHER, S&P WARNED, AS AIRLINE CUSTOMERS CANCEL FLIGHTS AND DEFER AIRCRAFT ORDERS DUE TO A PLUNGE IN TRAVEL DEMAND.

LAST YEAR, AS YOU MAY RECALL, INVESTORS SUED BOEING OVER ALLEGED MISREPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF 737 MAX AIRPLANES, ASSERTING THAT BOEING WAS SO CONSUMED BY COMPETITION WITH AIRBUS THAT IT DISREGARDED RED FLAGS ABOUT THE PLANES. (BOEING COUNSEL FROM KIRKLAND & ELLIS DID NOT RESPOND TO MY EMAIL QUERY ABOUT SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 ALLEGATIONS.)  WANT MORE ON THE CASE? LISTEN TO THE ON THE CASE PODCAST.  BOEING LOST TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MARKET CAPITALIZATION AFTER CRASHES INVOLVING 737 MAX PLANES, MAKING IT A JUICY TARGET FOR SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 LAWYERS HOPING THEIR CLIENTS WOULD BE APPOINTED TO HEAD THE SECURITIES FRAUD CLASS ACTION. TWO INVESTORS EMERGED AS CANDIDATES FOR LEAD PLAINTIFF. KAHN SWICK & FOTI REPRESENTED THE WANGS, A NEVADA FAMILY THAT LIVED QUITE MODESTLY \u2013 THE MOM, FOR INSTANCE, WORKED AS A STATE PEST CONTROL OFFICER AND THE SON, A CASINO EMPLOYEE, MOONLIGHTED AT A PEST CONTROL BUSINESS \u2013 YET CLAIMED TO HAVE LOST $4.7 MILLION ON A $40 MILLION INVESTMENT IN BOEING. BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ BERGER & GROSSMANN, MEANWHILE, REPRESENTED THE MISSISSIPPI PUBLIC EMPLOYEES\u2019 RETIREMENT SYSTEM, WHICH ALLEGED SMALLER LOSSES OF $2.5 MILLION, BUT ARGUED THAT, AS AN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR WITH LONG EXPERIENCE IN SECURITIES LITIGATION, IT WOULD BETTER SERVE THE CLASS. (ORDINARILY, AS YOU KNOW, THE SHAREHOLDER WITH THE LARGEST LOSSES IS PRESUMED TO BE THE BEST CANDIDATE TO LEAD SECURITIES FRAUD LITIGATION AS LONG AS IT MEETS OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR NAMED PLAINTIFFS IN CLASS ACTIONS.)  THE CONTEST TURNED UGLY AFTER BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ HIRED PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS TO INTERVIEW THE WANGS\u2019 FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS AND COWORKERS ABOUT HOW AN APPARENTLY MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILY ACQUIRED A $40 MILLION STAKE IN BOEING. THE WANGS FILED A SUIT IN NEVADA STATE COURT TO BLOCK THE INVESTIGATION. BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ THEN ARGUED THAT THE FAMILY WAS ATTEMPTING TO CIRCUMVENT U.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE JOHN THARP IN FEDERAL COURT.  LAST NOVEMBER, JUDGE THARP PICKED THE MISSISSIPPI PENSION FUND TO SERVE AS LEAD PLAINTIFF. AS I REPORTED AT THE TIME, THE JUDGE NOTED THAT THE WANGS HAD NOT SUPPLIED TRADING RECORDS TO CORROBORATE THEIR ENORMOUS CLAIMED LOSSES OR EXPLAIN WHAT SEEMED TO BE UNUSUAL TRADING PATTERNS. BUT EVEN IF HE WERE TO ACCEPT THE WANGS\u2019 SWORN REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THEIR BOEING LOSSES, THE JUDGE HELD, THE FAMILY COULD NOT SERVE AS LEAD PLAINTIFF BECAUSE THE WANGS HADN\u2019T SHOWN THEY WOULD ADEQUATELY REPRESENT THE CLASS OF SHAREHOLDERS. THEIR CONDUCT IN THE LEAD PLAINTIFF SELECTION PROCESS, HE SAID, RAISED TOO MANY DOUBTS AND QUESTIONS.  THE WANGS MOVED FOR RECONSIDERATION, OFFERING INFORMATION SUCH AS TRADING RECORDS AND RECENT TAX RETURNS SHOWING $9 MILLION IN CAPITAL GAINS, TO SUBSTANTIATE THEIR ACCOUNT OF A $4.7 MILLION LOSS IN BOEING TRADES. IN JANUARY, JUDGE THARP DENIED THE FAMILY\u2019S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION. \u201cEVEN ASSUMING, ARGUENDO, THAT THE ADDITIONAL DECLARATIONS AND THE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS ATTESTING TO THEIR TRADING HISTORY NOW ESTABLISH THE BONA FIDES OF THEIR CLAIMED LOSSES,\u201d THE JUDGE WROTE, \u201cTHEIR PRODUCTION OF THIS INFORMATION DOES NOT RESOLVE THE COURT\u2019S CONCERNS AS TO THEIR ADEQUACY TO REPRESENT THOUSANDS OF CLASS MEMBERS IN THIS COMPLEX AND SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION.\u201d  THE WANGS AND KAHN SWICK BROUGHT IN APPELLATE LITIGATOR DANIEL GEYSER, WHO FILED A MANDAMUS PETITION AT THE 7TH CIRCUIT IN MARCH. ON MONDAY NIGHT, BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ FILED THE MISSPERS RESPONSE.  IN ESSENCE, THE TWO SIDES DISAGREE ABOUT WHETHER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995, WHICH GOVERNS THE SELECTION OF LEAD PLAINTIFFS IN SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTIONS, REQUIRED JUDGE THARP TO CONSIDER THE WANGS PRESUMPTIVE LEAD INVESTORS BASED ONLY ON THE CERTIFICATIONS THAT ACCOMPANIED THEIR BRIEFING. BOTH SIDES CITE SEMINAL LEAD PLAINTIFF OPINIONS FROM THE 9TH CIRCUIT IN 2002\u2019S IN RE CAVANAUGH AND THE 3RD CIRCUIT IN 2005\u2019S IN RE CENDANT. BUT THE WANGS CONTEND THAT THE 7TH CIRCUIT WILL DEPART FROM THAT PRECEDENT IF IT ENDORSES JUDGE THARP\u2019S FAILURE TO REGARD THE FAMILY AS THE PRESUMPTIVE LEAD PLAINTIFFS. MISSPERS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARGUES THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE ENGAGED IN PRECISELY THE ANALYSIS OUTLINED IN CAVANAUGH AND CENDANT, WHICH HOLDS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT JUDGES HAVE DISCRETION IN THE SELECTION PROCESS.  THE WANGS\u2019 PETITION SAID THAT THE FAMILY MADE A PRIMA FACIE SHOWING THAT IT HAD SUSTAINED THE LARGEST LOSSES, WAS A TYPICAL INVESTOR AND WOULD ADEQUATELY REPRESENT THE CLASS. THAT\u2019S ALL THAT IS REQUIRED UNDER THE PSLRA, THE BRIEF SAID, TO TRIGGER THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PRESUMPTION. IF JUDGE THARP HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE WANGS\u2019 REPRESENTATIONS OR THEIR SOPHISTICATION AS INVESTORS, THE FAMILY ARGUED, HE SHOULD HAVE ORDERED DISCOVERY RATHER THAN DISQUALIFYING THE WANGS FROM SERVING AS LEAD PLAINTIFF.  \u201cTHE DISTRICT COURT WRONGLY BRUSHED PETITIONERS ASIDE DESPITE THEIR STATUTORY RIGHT TO LEAD THIS LITIGATION,\u201d THE WANGS\u2019 PETITION SAID. \u201cIT DISQUALIFIED PETITIONERS BASED ON UNSUBSTANTIATED GUESSWORK, WITHOUT DISCOVERY, WITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND, AND CERTAINLY WITHOUT ANY \u2018PROOF\u2019 OF INADEQUACY.\u201d  BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ RESPONDED THAT JUDGE THARP PROPERLY CONCLUDED THE WANGS FAILED TO ESTABLISH THEIR PRIMA FACIE ADEQUACY AS CLASS REPRESENTATIVES BEFORE HE DECIDED WHETHER THEY QUALIFIED AS PRESUMPTIVE LEAD PLAINTIFFS. THE JUDGE WEIGHED THE DEARTH OF INFORMATION INITIALLY SUPPLIED BY THE FAMILY AND THE WANGS\u2019 ATTEMPT TO BLOCK INVESTIGATION OF THEIR REPRESENTATIONS, BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ ARGUED. THAT CONDUCT ALONE ESTABLISHED THAT THE WANGS CAN\u2019T ADEQUATELY REPRESENT THE CLASS \u2013 SO THEY WERE NEVER ENTITLED TO THE PRESUMPTION THAT THEY COULD SERVE AS LEAD PLAINTIFFS. THE PSLRA, ACCORDING TO THE RESPONSE BRIEF, CALLS FOR DISCOVERY ON PRESUMED LEAD PLAINTIFFS, BUT BECAUSE THE WANGS WERE NEVER PRESUMPTIVE LEADS, THERE WAS NO NEED TO CONDUCT THAT DISCOVERY.  MORE BROADLY, THE RESPONSE BRIEF SAID, IF THE 7TH CIRCUIT WERE TO ADOPT THE WANGS\u2019 POSITION THAT TRIAL JUDGES MUST RELY ENTIRELY ON CERTIFICATIONS FROM LEAD PLAINTIFF CANDIDATES, IT WOULD \u201cREDUCE THE DISTRICT COURT TO A MERE RUBBER STAMP, ELIMINATING ITS JUDGMENT AND DISCRETION TO DETERMINE A LEAD PLAINTIFF\u2019S ADEQUACY,\u201d THE MISSPERS RESPONSE SAID. \u201cTHIS WAS NOT CONGRESS\u2019 INTENT IN CRAFTING THE PSLRA\u2019S LEAD PLAINTIFF PROVISIONS.\u201d  IN AN EMAIL, WANG COUNSEL GEYSER SAID THE NEW MISSPERS RESPONSE CONFIRMS WHY THE 7TH CIRCUIT MUST GRANT MANDAMUS TO CORRECT JUDGE THARP\u2019S DECISION. \u201cTHEY EFFECTIVELY CONFIRM THAT THE DISTRICT COURT DID EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS NOT ALLOWED TO DO: IT IGNORED THE PSLRA\u2019S MANDATORY PROCESS, DISQUALIFIED THE PROPER LEAD PLAINTIFF BASED ON UNFOUNDED \u2018QUESTIONS\u2019 AND \u2018CONCERNS,\u2019 AND WRONGLY ELIMINATED THE WANGS\u2019 STATUTORY RIGHT TO LEAD THE CLASS,\u201d GEYSER SAID.  MISSPERS COUNSEL AVI JOSEFSON OF BERNSTEIN LITOWITZ DID NOT IMMEDIATELY RESPOND TO AN EMAIL REQUESTING COMMENT. IN ADDITION TO ARGUMENTS THAT JUDGE THARP WAS FAITHFUL TO THE STATUTE AND CORRECTLY HELD THE WANGS WERE NOT PRESUMPTIVE LEAD PLAINTIFFS, THE RESPONSE BRIEF CONTENDED THAT THE FAMILY WILL SUFFER NO HARM FROM THE JUDGE\u2019S RULING BECAUSE IT CAN OPT OUT OF THE CLASS ACTION AND PURSUE ITS OWN CLAIMS AGAINST BOEING.", "Ticker": "BA", "Date": "2020-04-07T00:00:00", "key": "20200407BA", "labelr0": -4.832963635141492, "labelr1": 3.736403446814516, "labelr2": 3.383944985361203, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": -2.970231822971543, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.0, "0_day_return": -4.832963635141496, "1_day_return": 3.736403446814518, "2_day_return": 7.246786269247062, "3_day_return": 7.246786269247062, "4_day_return": 4.061308094363603, "label": 1, "return": 0.03405645274589771, "excess_return": 3.70234699406862, "count_of_word": 1150, "pred": -1, "prof-1": 0.49310833, "prof1": 0.5068917000000001, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5396993029364356, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4603006970635643, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.49310833, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.5068917000000001, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.54448986, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.4555102, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5221812, "tr_prof1": 0.4778188, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.61708057, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.38291943, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.589496, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.41050398, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.5496754, "headline_prof21": 0.4503246, "textplusheadline_pred": -1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.58466476, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.41533524, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.28853452, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.7114654, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.5342284, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.46577165, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -3.736403446814518, "returnpredvader": -3.736403446814518, "returnpredsgd": -3.736403446814518, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9626359655318548, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9626359655318548, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9626359655318548, "cumreturn1b": 1.2026884120855472, "cumreturn1d": 0.639912735256144, "cumreturn1e": 1.005029165440552, "cumreturndow": 1.0861158021441397, "cumreturnsp500": 1.000017503273024}, {"Unnamed: 0": 24096, "Unnamed: 0.1": 24096, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 24096, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 24096, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 24096, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 24096, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 24096, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 24096, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 24096, "level_0": 24096, "index": 24096, "text": "APRIL 16 (REUTERS) - BOEING CO SAID IT WILL RESUME COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PRODUCTION NEXT WEEK IN WASHINGTON STATE AFTER SUSPENDING OPERATIONS LAST MONTH IN RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

REUTERS/PAULO WHITAKER  THE AIRCRAFT HAS NOT FLOWN IN MORE THAN A YEAR BECAUSE OF TWO DEADLY CRASHES THAT FORCED REGULATORS TO SCRUTINIZE THE SAFETY OF ITS DESIGN.  THE TIMING OF THE PAYMENTS HAS BECOME A LIFELINE FOR GOL, WHICH, LIKE ITS PEERS WORLDWIDE, IS REELING FROM THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS.  BUT THE DISCLOSURE ALSO PROVIDES A POINT OF REFERENCE FOR WHAT KIND OF COMPENSATION OTHER AIRLINES WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN.  ACCORDING TO GOL, IT HAS ALREADY RECEIVED CLOSE TO 500 MILLION REAIS IN CASH. IN ADDITION, IT STANDS TO RECEIVE UP TO 1.9 BILLION REAIS IN CREDITS THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO NEW AIRCRAFT ACQUISITIONS, USED TO REDUCE INTEREST AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSES.  THAT AMOUNT IS THE MAXIMUM AND IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN UNDISCLOSED CONDITIONS. GOL SAID IT MAY RECEIVE LESS THAN THAT.  GOL, BRAZIL\u2019S LARGEST AIRLINE, IS ONE OF BOEING\u2019S BIGGEST CUSTOMERS AND HAD ORDERED MORE THAN 100 BOEING 737 MAX PLANES. THOSE ORDERS HAVE SINCE BEEN REDUCED AND GOL SAID IT WILL NOT MAKE NEW AIRCRAFT PAYMENTS TO BOEING FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS.  THE COMPANY FLIES BOEING 737 PLANES EXCLUSIVELY, REFLECTING THE BUSINESS MODEL OF SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO (LUV.N), WHICH HAS REACHED ONLY A PARTIAL SETTLEMENT WITH BOEING AND SAID IT WOULD SHARE $125 MILLION WITH EMPLOYEES.  IN A SECURITIES FILING, GOL SAID THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS CAUSED AN 80% DECREASE IN REVENUE IN APRIL TO 138 MILLION REAIS. APRIL WAS THE FIRST FULL MONTH OF TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD DUE TO THE PANDEMIC, AND GOL IS ONE OF THE FIRST AIRLINES TO REPORT ITS IMPACT.  GOL SHARES, WHICH ARE DOWN 73% SO FAR THIS YEAR, WERE LITTLE CHANGED IN AFTERNOON TRADING ON THE SAO PAULO STOCK EXCHANGE.  THE COMPANY SAYS IT HAS ENOUGH CASH ON HAND TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS AT THIS RATE FOR MORE THAN 10 MONTHS.  STILL, GOL SAID IT IS DISCUSSING ADDITIONAL FINANCING OF UP TO 1 BILLION REAIS WITH UNNAMED ENTITIES.
