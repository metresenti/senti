<p>**Model Sanity Check</p>
<p>Model sanity check was carried out across the different models to compare returns; given that models are picking different news articles, the check was to make sure a lower accuracy model was not picking news articles that led to higher average returns and thus would lead to a situation where lower accuracy models outperform higher accuracy models.</p>

REUTERS/DANIEL BECERRIL  WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - GENERAL MOTORS CO (GM.N) HIT 200,000 TOTAL ELECTRIC VEHICLES SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES BY THE END OF 2018, REACHING A THRESHOLD THAT TRIGGERS A PHASE-OUT OF A $7,500 FEDERAL TAX CREDIT OVER THE NEXT 15 MONTHS, A PERSON BRIEFED ON THE MATTER SAID WEDNESDAY.  THE LARGEST U.S. AUTOMAKER REACHED THE FIGURE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WHICH MEANS THE CREDIT WILL FALL TO $3,750 IN APRIL, AND THEN DROP TO $1,875 IN OCTOBER FOR SIX MONTHS. THE CREDIT WILL COMPLETELY DISAPPEAR BY APRIL 2020. THE 200,000 FIGURE COVERS GM\u2019S CUMULATIVE EV SALES SINCE 2010.  THE TAX CREDIT IS AIMED AT DEFRAYING THE COST OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN SIMILARLY SIZED INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE VEHICLES. IN 2009, CONGRESS SET THE PHASE-OUT THRESHOLD AT 200,000 VEHICLES PER MANUFACTURER.  GM, WHICH SAID PREVIOUSLY IT EXPECTED TO REACH THE 200,000 SALES FIGURE BEFORE THE END OF 2018, DECLINED TO COMMENT AHEAD OF THE RELEASE OF ITS QUARTERLY SALES RESULTS ON THURSDAY.  GM AND TESLA INC (TSLA.O), WHICH HIT THE 200,000 FIGURE IN JULY 2018, HAVE BOTH LOBBIED CONGRESS TO LIFT THE CAP OR EXTEND THE EXISTING TAX CREDIT. TESLA\u2019S EV TAX CREDIT FELL TO $3,750 ON TUESDAY AND TESLA SAID IT WAS CUTTING PRICES ON ITS EVS BY $2,000 TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE LOWER TAX CREDIT.  IN MARCH, GM CHIEF EXECUTIVE MARY BARRA CALLED ON CONGRESS TO EXPAND THE CONSUMER TAX CREDIT FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES AS THE COMPANY BOOSTED PRODUCTION OF THE EV BOLT IN RESPONSE TO CONSUMER DEMAND. SHE REPEATED THE REQUEST LAST MONTH DURING A VISIT TO CAPITOL HILL.

EUROPEAN MARKETS WERE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW, WITH BOOKMAKERS PREDICTING LONDON\u2019S FTSE AND FRANKFURT\u2019S DAX WOULD OPEN 0.4 PERCENT LOWER AND PARIS\u2019 CAC40 DOWN 0.6 PERCENT.  APPLE BLAMED FEWER IPHONE UPGRADES AND SLOWING SALES IN CHINA IN ITS MOST RECENT QUARTER, ITS FIRST SUCH WARNING SINCE 2007. ITS SHARES TUMBLED IN AFTER-HOURS TRADE.  THE NEWS SPARKED A \u2018FLASH CRASH\u2019 IN HOLIDAY-THINNED CURRENCY MARKETS AS INVESTORS RUSHED TO LESS RISKY ASSETS, WITH THE JAPANESE YEN SOARING AGAINST MOST MAJOR CURRENCIES IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.

TRUMP\u2019S DEMAND FOR $5 BILLION IN FUNDING FOR A WALL ALONG THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER TRIGGERED THE SHUTDOWN AFFECTING ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND 800,000 FEDERAL WORKERS.  \u2018FLASH CRASH\u2019  CURRENCY MARKETS SAW A WILD SPIKE IN VOLATILITY IN EARLY ASIAN TRADE, WITH RISK AVERSION PUSHING THE YEN SHARPLY HIGHER AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR, BREAKING KEY TECHNICAL LEVELS AND TRIGGERING STOP-LOSS SALES OF U.S. AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS.

THAT RARE FORECAST CUT EXPOSED WEAKENING IPHONE DEMAND IN CHINA, THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST SMARTPHONE MARKET, WHERE A SLOWING ECONOMY HAS ALSO BEEN BUFFETED BY A TRADE WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES.  MANY ANALYSTS AND CONSUMERS HAVE SAID THE NEW IPHONES ARE OVERPRICED.  APPLE ASKED ITS SUPPLIERS LATE LAST MONTH TO PRODUCE FEWER-THAN-PLANNED UNITS OF ITS XS, XS MAX AND XR MODELS, THE NIKKEI REPORTED, CITING SOURCES WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE REQUEST.  THE REQUEST WAS MADE BEFORE APPLE ANNOUNCED ITS FORECAST CUT, THE NIKKEI SAID. THE BLEAKER SALES OUTLOOK, WHICH APPLE ATTRIBUTED TO WEAK CHINA DEMAND, TRIGGERED A BROAD SELL-OFF IN GLOBAL STOCK MARKETS.  MARKET RESEARCH FIRM CANALYS ESTIMATES SHIPMENTS FELL 12 PERCENT IN CHINA LAST YEAR AND EXPECTS SMARTPHONE SHIPMENTS IN 2019 TO DIP ANOTHER 3 PERCENT, TO BELOW 400 MILLION FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2014.

ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED TO UNDERPIN THE CRYPTOCURRENCY BITCOIN, THE TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT REQUIRE THIRD-PARTIES FOR CHECKS AND ITS ENTRIES CANNOT BE CHANGED, MAKING IT HIGHLY SECURE.  BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL FIRMS HAVE INVESTED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE TECHNOLOGY, HOPING IT WILL SIMPLIFY AND SLASH COSTS IN PROCESSES FROM SETTLEMENTS TO PAYMENTS.  BUT FEW BANKS MOVED FROM TESTING TO IMPLEMENTATION OF BLOCKCHAIN IN LARGE-SCALE PROJECTS. MANY ARE WORRIED ABOUT HIGH COSTS, UNCERTAINTY OVER REGULATION AND THE RISK OF DISRUPTION TO EXISTING SYSTEMS.  HSBC SAID ITS BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY HAS AUTOMATED MANUAL PROCESSES AND REDUCED ITS RELIANCE ON EXTERNAL TECHNOLOGY.  BLOCKCHAIN HAS ALSO LOWERED THE RISKS OF ERRORS AND DELAYS, CUT COSTS, AND HELPED THE BANK TO BETTER OPTIMISE ITS BALANCE SHEET, IT SAID.

REUTERS/ADRIANO MACHADO/FILE PHOTO  THE FORCE MAJEURE ON SOME IRON ORE AND PELLETS SALES CONTRACTS CAME AFTER A COURT ON MONDAY ORDERED IT TO STOP USING EIGHT TAILINGS DAMS, INCLUDING ONE AFFECTING PRODUCTION OF ABOUT 30 MILLION TONNES OF IRON ORE OUTPUT PER YEAR.

REUTERS/CHARLES PLATIAU  THE NEW LIST PRICE FOR PRALUENT WILL BE $5,850 A YEAR, MATCHING THE PRICE AMGEN SET WHEN IT LOWERED THE LIST OF ITS COMPETING DRUG, REPATHA, IN OCTOBER.  SANOFI AND REGENERON SAID THEY EXPECT THE LOWER-PRICED PRALUENT TO BE AVAILABLE FOR PHARMACIES TO ORDER IN EARLY MARCH. THEY SAID THE NEW PRICE SHOULD IMPROVE PATIENT ACCESS AND RESULT IN LOWER OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS FOR U.S. CONSUMERS.  PRALUENT AND REPATHA BELONG A CLASS OF INJECTABLE BIOTECH DRUGS CALLED PCSK9 INHIBITORS THAT DRAMATICALLY LOWER BAD LDL CHOLESTEROL AND REDUCE THE RISK OF HEART ATTACKS AND DEATH.  SALES OF BOTH HAVE BEEN SEVERELY CONSTRAINED BY ONEROUS ROADBLOCKS TO PATIENT ACCESS PUT UP BY INSURERS LOOKING TO LIMIT SPENDING ON THE EXPENSIVE DRUGS.  THEY WERE APPROVED IN 2015 WITH INITIAL LIST PRICES OF MORE THAN $14,000 A YEAR.  IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR, REGENERON AND SANOFI SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO CHARGE LESS FOR THEIR DRUG IF INSURERS AGREED TO REDUCE BARRIERS FOR HIGH-RISK HEART PATIENTS.  A FEW MONTHS LATER THEY STRUCK A DEAL WITH EXPRESS SCRIPTS, NOW PART OF CIGNA CORP, TO MAKE THE DRUG AVAILABLE TO THAT COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMERS AT A PRICE IN THE RANGE OF $4,500 TO $6,600 A YEAR.  THE UNITED STATES, WHICH LEAVES DRUG PRICING TO MARKET COMPETITION, HAS HIGHER PRICES THAN IN OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WHERE GOVERNMENTS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY CONTROL COSTS. THAT MAKES IT BY FAR THE WORLD\u2019S MOST LUCRATIVE MARKET FOR MANUFACTURERS.

FILE PHOTO: A QUALCOMM SIGN IS SEEN DURING THE CHINA INTERNATIONAL IMPORT EXPO (CIIE), AT THE NATIONAL EXHIBITION AND CONVENTION CENTER IN SHANGHAI, CHINA NOVEMBER 6, 2018. REUTERS/ALY SONG/FILE PHOTO  QUALCOMM IS SEEKING THE BAN IN HOPES OF DEALING APPLE A BLOW BEFORE THE TWO BEGIN A MAJOR TRIAL IN MID-APRIL IN SAN DIEGO OVER QUALCOMM\u2019S PATENT LICENSING PRACTICES. QUALCOMM HAS SOUGHT TO APPLY PRESSURE TO APPLE WITH SMALLER LEGAL CHALLENGES AHEAD OF THAT TRIAL AND HAS WON PARTIAL IPHONE SALES BANS IN CHINA AND GERMANY AGAINST APPLE, FORCING THE IPHONE MAKER TO SHIP ONLY PHONES WITH QUALCOMM CHIPS TO SOME MARKETS.  ANY POSSIBLE BAN ON IPHONE IMPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES COULD BE SHORT-LIVED BECAUSE APPLE LAST WEEK FOR THE FIRST TIME DISCLOSED THAT IT HAS FOUND A SOFTWARE FIX TO AVOID INFRINGING ON ONE OF QUALCOMM\u2019S PATENTS. APPLE ASKED REGULATORS TO GIVE IT AS MUCH AS SIX MONTHS TO PROVE THAT THE FIX WORKS.  QUALCOMM BROUGHT A CASE AGAINST APPLE AT THE U.S INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION IN 2017 ALLEGING THAT SOME IPHONES VIOLATED QUALCOMM PATENTS TO HELP SMART PHONES RUN WELL WITHOUT DRAINING THEIR BATTERIES. QUALCOMM ASKED FOR AN IMPORT BAN ON SOME OLDER IPHONE MODELS CONTAINING INTEL CORP CHIPS.  IN SEPTEMBER, THOMAS PENDER, AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE AT THE ITC, FOUND THAT APPLE VIOLATED ONE OF THE PATENTS IN THE CASE BUT DECLINED TO ISSUE A BAN. PENDER REASONED THAT IMPOSING A BAN ON INTEL-CHIPPED IPHONES WOULD HAND QUALCOMM AN EFFECTIVE MONOPOLY ON THE U.S. MARKET FOR MODEM CHIPS, WHICH CONNECT SMART PHONES TO WIRELESS DATA NETWORKS.  PENDER\u2019S RULING SAID THAT PRESERVING COMPETITION IN THE MODEM CHIP MARKET WAS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST AS SPEEDIER 5G NETWORKS COME ONLINE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.  CASES WHERE THE ITC FINDS PATENT VIOLATIONS BUT DOES NOT BAN THE IMPORT OF PRODUCTS ARE RARE. IN DECEMBER, THE FULL ITC SAID IT WOULD REVIEW PENDER\u2019S DECISION AND DECIDE WHETHER TO UPHOLD OR REVERSE IT BY LATE MARCH.  IN FILINGS THAT BECAME PUBLIC LATE LAST WEEK AHEAD OF THE FULL COMMISSION\u2019S DECISION, APPLE FOR THE FIRST TIME SAID THAT IT HAD DEVELOPED A SOFTWARE FIX TO AVOID RUNNING AFOUL OF QUALCOMM\u2019S PATENT. APPLE SAID IT DID NOT DISCOVER THE FIX UNTIL AFTER THE TRIAL AND THAT IT IMPLEMENTED THE NEW SOFTWARE \u201cLAST FALL.\u201d  BUT APPLE SAID THAT IT WOULD NEED SIX MONTHS TO VERIFY THAT THE FIX WILL SATISFY REGULATORS AND TO SELL ITS EXISTING INVENTORY. APPLE ASKED THE FULL COMMISSION TO DELAY ANY POSSIBLE IMPORT BAN BY THAT LONG IF THE COMMISSION REVERSES THE JUDGE\u2019S DECISIONS.  IN A FILING LATE ON FRIDAY, QUALCOMM ARGUED THAT APPLE\u2019S DISCLOSURE OF A FIX UNDERMINED THE REASONING IN PENDER\u2019S DECISION AND THAT THE INTEL-CHIPPED PHONES SHOULD BE BANNED WHILE APPLE DEPLOYS ITS FIX.  \u201cPENDER RECOMMENDED AGAINST A REMEDY ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE (QUALCOMM) PATENT WOULD PRECLUDE APPLE FROM USING INTEL AS A SUPPLIER FOR MANY YEARS AND THAT NO REDESIGN WAS FEASIBLE,\u201d QUALCOMM WROTE. \u201cAPPLE NOW ADMITS\u2014MORE THAN SEVEN MONTHS AFTER THE HEARING\u2014THAT THE ALLEGED HARM IS ENTIRELY AVOIDABLE.\u201d", "Ticker": "AAPL", "Date": "2019-02-20T00:00:00", "key": "20190220AAPL", "labelr0": 0.6435382905282832, "labelr1": -0.5638551415450787, "labelr2": 1.116567286332279, "labelr3": 0.7284500202347176, "labelr4": 0.05739539688918253, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.265, "compound": -0.5574, "0_day_return": 0.6435382905282783, "1_day_return": 0.6435382905282783, "2_day_return": 0.5464163227343999, "3_day_return": 1.2788467127826442, "4_day_return": 1.336976108818222, "label": 1, "return": -0.003526436662044688, "excess_return": 0.6470647271903229, "count_of_word": 537, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5443975000000001, "prof1": 0.45560256, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.4774365663247129, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.5225634336752871, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5443975000000001, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.45560256, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.38450506, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.6154949000000001, "tr_pred": 1, "tr_prof-1": 0.4691151, "tr_prof1": 0.5308849, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.5488420999999999, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.45115793, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.48116577, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.5188343, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.61487484, "headline_prof21": 0.38512516, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.42733282, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5726671999999999, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.28277457, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.7172254, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.362244, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.63775605, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 0.6435382905282783, "returnpredvader": -0.6435382905282783, "returnpredsgd": 0.6435382905282783, "returnfst_spacy_pred": 0.6435382905282783, "returnfst_sentencepc_pred2": 0.6435382905282783, "returnheadline_pred": -0.6435382905282783, "returntextplusheadline_pred": 0.6435382905282783, "returntr_headlineplustext_pred": 0.6435382905282783, "returntr_headline_pred": 0.6435382905282783, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9968187197985601, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0032720810900513, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0025797291504805, "dailyaveragereturnfst_spacy_pred": 0.9893859620013951, "dailyaveragereturnfst_sentencepc_pred2": 0.0, "dailyaveragereturnreturnfst_sentencepc_pred2": 1.0007898700098938, "dailyaveragereturnreturnheadline_pred": 1.0056906829729455, "dailyaveragereturnreturntextplusheadline_pred": 0.998116138368199, "dailyaveragereturnreturntr_headlineplustext_pred": 0.9945474416012409, "dailyaveragereturnreturntr_headline_pred": 1.0054711554179911, "cumreturn1b": 1.2037113807435078, "cumreturn1d": 1.0770257238589733, "cumreturn1e": 1.1002753534510863, "cumreturn1f": 0.956825615501925, "cumreturn1g": 0.0, "cumreturn1h": 0.9424908581633695, "cumreturn1i": 1.0206375225623847, "cumreturn1j": 1.1534361278587817, "cumreturn1k": 1.1975373294150518, "cumreturndow": 1.1055166077457306, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1072716891413106}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2464, "Unnamed: 0.1": 2464, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 2464, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 2464, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 2464, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 2464, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 2464, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 2464, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 2464, "level_0": 2464, "index": 2464, "text": "SAO PAULO, FEB 21 (REUTERS) - BRAZILIAN STEELMAKER GERDAU SA PLANS TO INVEST 300 MILLION REAIS ($79.6 MILLION) THROUGH 2021 TO IMPLEMENT A MINING PROCESS KNOWN AS DRY STACKING IN THE BRAZILIAN STATE OF MINAS GERAIS, AN EXECUTIVE SAID ON AN EARNINGS CALL THURSDAY.

FILE PHOTO: A WOMAN HOLDS HER PHONE NEAR AN APPLE COMPANY LOGO IN BEIJING, CHINA DECEMBER 14, 2018. REUTERS/JASON LEE  JUDGE GONZALO CURIEL OF THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA ON THURSDAY RULED THAT QUALCOMM, THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST SUPPLIER OF MOBILE PHONE CHIPS, WAS OBLIGATED TO PAY NEARLY $1 BILLION IN REBATE PAYMENTS TO APPLE, WHICH FOR YEARS USED QUALCOMM\u2019S MODEM CHIPS TO CONNECT IPHONES TO WIRELESS DATA NETWORKS.  THE PAYMENTS WERE PART OF A BUSINESS COOPERATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO COMPANIES AMID THE PECULIAR PATENT LICENSING PRACTICES OF THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY.  IN GENERAL, THE CONTRACT FACTORIES THAT BUILT APPLE\u2019S IPHONES WOULD PAY QUALCOMM BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR THE USE OF QUALCOMM\u2019S PATENTED TECHNOLOGY IN IPHONES, A COST THAT APPLE WOULD REIMBURSE THE CONTRACT FACTORIES FOR. SEPARATELY, QUALCOMM AND APPLE HAD A COOPERATION AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH QUALCOMM WOULD PAY APPLE A REBATE ON THE IPHONE PATENT PAYMENTS IF APPLE AGREED NOT TO ATTACK IN COURT OR WITH REGULATORS.  IN A LAWSUIT FILED TWO YEARS AGO, APPLE SUED QUALCOMM, ALLEGING THAT THE CHIP SUPPLIER HAD BROKEN THE COOPERATION AGREEMENT BY NOT PAYING NEARLY $1 BILLION IN PATENT ROYALTY REBATES.  QUALCOMM IN TURN ALLEGED THAT IT STOPPED PAYING THE REBATE PAYMENTS BECAUSE APPLE HAD BROKEN THE AGREEMENT BY URGING OTHER SMARTPHONE MAKERS TO COMPLAIN TO REGULATORS AND MAKING \u201cFALSE AND MISLEADING\u201d STATEMENTS TO THE KOREAN FAIR TRADE COMMISSION, WHICH WAS INVESTIGATING QUALCOMM OVER ANTITRUST ALLEGATIONS.

REUTERS/RICARDO MORAES/FILE PHOTO  THE PLAN TO SPLIT UP THE CARRIER, FILED IN A BRAZILIAN COURT ON WEDNESDAY, IS A SIGNIFICANT DEPARTURE FROM A PREVIOUS PROPOSAL AND ADDS FRESH COMPETITION FOR SOME OF THE MOST-COVETED AIRPORT SLOTS IN BRAZIL. BUT IT ALSO SHUTS THE DOOR ON A PREVIOUS OFFER BY COMPETITOR AZUL SA.  AZUL SIGNED A PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT THIS MONTH TO PAY AT LEAST $105 MILLION FOR A SELECTION OF AVIANCA BRASIL\u2019S ASSETS, A PROPOSAL THAT HAD BEEN CONSIDERED A COUP BY ANALYSTS WHO SAW IT AS A WAY FOR AZUL TO CHALLENGE ITS BIGGER COMPETITORS: LATAM AND GOL.  AZUL ALSO LAST MONTH GAVE AVIANCA BRASIL A MUCH-NEEDED CASH INJECTION OF 31.6 MILLION REAIS ($8.21 MILLION) AFTER IT FELL BEHIND ON ITS PAYROLL.  BUT AVIANCA BRASIL\u2019S NEW PLAN INVOLVES DIVIDING UP THE ASSETS AZUL SOUGHT, WHICH INCLUDE AIRPORT SLOTS AND ITS LOYALTY MILEAGE PROGRAM, INTO MULTIPLE NEW COMPANIES.  GOL AND LATAM ARE NOW OFFERING AT LEAST $70 MILLION EACH, AND BOTH SAID THEIR BIDS HAD BEEN REQUESTED BY AVIANCA BRASIL\u2019S LARGEST CREDITOR, HEDGE FUND ELLIOTT MANAGEMENT.  A PERSON INVOLVED IN THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS SAID LAST WEEK THAT DISAGREEMENTS HAD EMERGED BETWEEN AZUL AND CREDITORS THAT THREATENED TO DERAIL THE INITIAL $105 MILLION OFFER.  AZUL DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE STATUS OF ITS POTENTIAL BID. TO BE SURE, AZUL COULD STILL BID, BUT NOT UNDER ITS INITIAL PROPOSAL, WHICH HAD ALSO INCLUDED TAKING OVER MANY OF AVIANCA\u2019S AIRCRAFT LEASES.  AZUL CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER JOHN RODGERSON TOLD REUTERS IN MARCH THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT LATAM OR GOL COULD BID FOR AVIANCA BRASIL, DUE TO POTENTIAL ANTITRUST ISSUES. BUT SPLITTING UP AVIANCA BRASIL INTO SMALLER CHUNKS COULD HELP THOSE CARRIERS CARVE UP DESIRABLE AIRPORT SLOTS AND AVOID ANTITRUST TROUBLES.

REUTERS/CHARLES PLATIAU  LONDON (REUTERS BREAKINGVIEWS) - DEUTSCHE BANK\u2019S LATEST STRATEGY FOR BOOSTING ITS APPEAL MAY BE ITS MOST EFFECTIVE YET: THE GERMAN LENDER HEADED BY CHRISTIAN SEWING HAS BANNED STAFF FROM DORCHESTER COLLECTION HOTELS AFTER ITS OWNER, THE GOVERNMENT OF BRUNEI, IMPLEMENTED HOMOPHOBIC LAWS. SHAREHOLDERS WILL WELCOME THE FACT THAT EMPLOYEES OF A BANK WHOSE COSTS ATE UP 93 PERCENT OF REVENUE LAST YEAR WILL NO LONGER FREQUENT A CHAIN WHICH CHARGES NEARLY 400 POUNDS A NIGHT FOR A STANDARD ROOM IN LONDON. HOWEVER, THE DECISION RAISES THE MORAL BAR.  BRUNEI\u2019S STATE-OWNED INVESTMENT AGENCY OWNS THE DORCHESTER COLLECTION HOTEL GROUP, WHICH INCLUDES LUXURY VENUES SUCH AS THE BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL AND HOTEL BEL-AIR IN LOS ANGELES. OSCAR-WINNING ACTOR GEORGE CLOONEY CALLED FOR A BOYCOTT AFTER THE GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTED ISLAMIC LAWS WHICH WOULD IMPOSE THE DEATH PENALTY FOR HOMOSEXUALITY OR ADULTERY. CELEBRITIES INCLUDING SINGER ELTON JOHN HAVE JOINED IN.  SHUNNING THE SULTANATE IS RELATIVELY PAINLESS FOR DEUTSCHE, WHICH HAS LIMITED BUSINESS IN BRUNEI. YET LIKE MANY OF ITS GLOBAL PEERS THE BANK CONTINUES TO OPERATE IN SAUDI ARABIA, WHICH ALSO HAS STRINGENT ANTI-HOMOSEXUALITY LAWS. GOLDMAN SACHS CEO DAVID SOLOMON RECENTLY MET GOVERNMENT-LINKED CLIENTS IN THE DESERT KINGDOM.  BANKS AND OTHER BIG MULTINATIONALS LONG ARGUED THAT THEY HAD TO ACCEPT THE LAWS OF COUNTRIES WHERE THEY DO BUSINESS. BUT PRESSURE FROM CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS IS FORCING THEM TO SET OUT MORAL POSITIONS. EMPLOYERS\u2019 EFFORTS TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A DIVERSE WORKFORCE IN THE WEST IS ALSO INCREASINGLY HARD TO SQUARE WITH MAINTAINING LINKS WITH REPRESSIVE REGIMES.  BIG COMPANIES GENERALLY MUSTER TWO DEFENCES. THE FIRST IS THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, A BOYCOTT WOULD BE COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE. THIS IS HOW COMPANIES JUSTIFIED THEIR PRESENCE IN SAUDI ARABIA \u2013 WHICH RECENTLY ALLOWED WOMEN TO DRIVE \u2013 AT LEAST UNTIL THE BRUTAL MURDER OF JOURNALIST JAMAL KHASHOGGI BY SAUDI AGENTS LAST YEAR.

FILE PHOTO: A LOGO OF THE BRAZIL'S STATE-RUN PETROBRAS OIL COMPANY IS SEEN IN RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL MARCH 25, 2019. REUTERS/SERGIO MORAES  THE NATIONAL ENERGY COUNCIL ANNOUNCED ON TUESDAY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD PAY PETROBRAS, AS THE COMPANY IS KNOWN, $9.058 BILLION TO END THEIR CONTRACT DISPUTE REGARDING THE \u201cTRANSFER OF RIGHTS AREA\u201d (TOR).  WHAT IS THAT?  THE TOR AREA IS A ROUGHLY 2,800-SQUARE-KM (1,080-SQUARE-MILE) ZONE OFF THE COAST OF SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL WHERE BILLIONS OF BARRELS OF OIL ARE TRAPPED BENEATH A THICK LAYER OF SALT UNDER THE OCEAN FLOOR. IT IS PART OF A LARGER OIL-PRODUCING ZONE KNOWN AS THE PRE-SALT, WHICH HAS EMERGED AS ONE OF THE WORLD\u2019S MOST PROMISING CONVENTIONAL OIL PLAYS.  THE TOR WAS DEMARCATED IN A 2010 DEAL BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND PETROBRAS, WHEN THE COMPANY RAISED SOME $70 BILLION IN THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST-EVER SHARE OFFERING AT THE TIME.  IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, THE GOVERNMENT GRANTED PETROBRAS THE RIGHTS TO EXTRACT 5 BILLION BARRELS OF OIL IN THE TOR AREA IN RETURN FOR NEW SHARES WORTH 74.8 BILLION REAIS, OR ABOUT $42.5 BILLION AT THE TIME.  THE GOVERNMENT ALSO SET ASIDE A \u201cCONTINGENCY AREA\u201d OF ABOUT 1,000 SQUARE KM (390 SQUARE MILES) IN CASE THE ORIGINAL AREA PROVED INSUFFICIENT.  WHY THE DISPUTE?  THE TOR ARRANGEMENT PROVIDED FOR PETROBRAS AND THE GOVERNMENT TO REVISE SOME TERMS IN THE CONTRACT WHEN FIELDS WERE DECLARED COMMERCIALLY VIABLE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SHIFTS IN OIL PRICES, PRODUCTION COSTS AND OTHER VARIABLES.  PETROBRAS BEGAN DECLARING TOR FIELDS COMMERCIALLY VIABLE IN 2013, STARTING WITH THE BUZIOS FIELD, AND HAS BEEN HAGGLING OVER CONTRACT REVISIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT EVER SINCE, AS OIL PRICES SWUNG SHARPLY AND STUDIES SHOWED LARGER RESERVES IN THE AREA.  BRAZILIAN OIL REGULATOR ANP NOW BELIEVES THERE ARE SOME 6 BILLION TO 15 BILLION BARRELS OF OIL IN THE TOR AREA, IN ADDITION TO THE ORIGINAL 5 BILLION BARRELS GRANTED TO PETROBRAS.  BRAZIL\u2019S CASH-STRAPPED GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO OFFER THAT ADDITIONAL OIL AT AUCTION BECAUSE IT HAD NOT COME TO TERMS WITH PETROBRAS ON THE REVISED TOR CONTRACT.  UNTIL RECENT MONTHS, THE TWO SIDES SEEMED FAR APART. BUT SINCE NEW PRESIDENT JAIR BOLSONARO APPOINTED A NEW PETROBRAS CHIEF EXECUTIVE IN JANUARY, TALKS SEEM TO HAVE PICKED UP PACE, CULMINATING IN THE MORE THAN $9 BILLION AGREEMENT.  WHAT IS NEXT?  THE GOVERNMENT HAS SCHEDULED FOR OCT. 28 AN AUCTION FOR THE RIGHTS TO EXTRACT THE EXCESS OIL IN THE TOR AREA, DIVIDED INTO FOUR SEPARATE FIELDS CALLED ATAPU, BUZIOS, ITAPU E SEPIA.  GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE SAID THE AUCTION COULD RAISE SOME 100 BILLION REAIS ($26 BILLION) OR MORE.  PETROBRAS AND THE GOVERNMENT ARE STILL DISCUSSING HOW THE AUCTION WINNERS WILL POTENTIALLY PARTNER WITH THE STATE OIL COMPANY, WHICH IS ALREADY PRODUCING AT BUZIOS AND HAS THE RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL TO REMAIN OPERATOR AT THE FOUR FIELDS.  REGARDLESS OF THE FINAL ARRANGEMENT, WINNERS OF THE AUCTION WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMPENSATE PETROBRAS FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPLORATORY WORK IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ALREADY INVESTED.  WHILE THE EXACT VALUE OF THAT COMPENSATION HAS NOT BEEN SETTLED, REUTERS REPORTED LATE LAST YEAR THAT THE COMPENSATION, WHICH IS SEPARATE FROM THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PAYMENT, IS LIKELY TO BE AT LEAST 30 BILLION REAIS ($7.9 BILLION).  WHO IS INTERESTED?  THE OCTOBER AUCTION IS EXPECTED TO ATTRACT A RANGE OF MAJOR GLOBAL OIL COMPANIES, WHICH HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THE OPPORTUNITY WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN RECENT MONTHS.  NOT LEAST AMONG THE INTERESTED PARTIES IS PETROBRAS ITSELF. WHILE THE FIRM IS AGGRESSIVELY CUTTING DEBT, CEO CASTELLO BRANCO HAS SAID THE $9 BILLION PAYMENT FROM THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE USED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE AUCTION.  AMONG THE COMPANIES WITH EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ASSETS ADJACENT OR RELATIVELY CLOSE TO THE TOR AREA, OFFERING POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS, ARE TOTAL SA, ROYAL DUTCH SHELL PLC, AND CHINA\u2019S CNOOC LTD AND CNPC.  HOWEVER, THEY MAY NEED TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR POLITICAL INTERFERENCE OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.  HOUSE SPEAKER RODRIGO MAIA HAS ARGUED THAT CONGRESS MUST APPROVE THE ACCORD BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND PETROBRAS BEFORE THE AUCTION CAN TAKE PLACE.

FILE PHOTO: THE MERCK LOGO IS SEEN AT A GATE TO THE MERCK & CO CAMPUS IN LINDEN, NEW JERSEY, U.S., JULY 12, 2018. REUTERS/BRENDAN MCDERMID/FILE PHOTO  THE NINE JUSTICES UNANIMOUSLY DIRECTED THE PHILADELPHIA-BASED 3RD U.S. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS TO RECONSIDER ITS DECISION TO LET THE LAWSUITS PROCEED EVEN THOUGH THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION HAD REBUFFED MERCK WHEN THE COMPANY SOUGHT TO ADD A WARNING TO FOSAMAX\u2019S LABEL ABOUT FRACTURE RISK.  MONDAY\u2019S RULING ADDED CLARITY TO A POWERFUL DEFENSE EMPLOYED BY DRUG MAKERS THAT PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER STATE LAW ARE PREEMPTED BY THE ACTIONS OF A FEDERAL AGENCY, BECAUSE FEDERAL LAW GENERALLY TRUMPS STATE LAW UNDER THE U.S. CONSTITUTION. MERCK ARGUED THAT IT CANNOT BE PENALIZED FOR FAILING TO ISSUE A WARNING THAT THE FDA HAD BLOCKED.  MERCK IN 2008 SUBMITTED DATA TO THE FDA SUGGESTING FOSAMAX MIGHT BE LINKED TO CERTAIN BONE FRACTURES, BUT THE FDA DENIED ITS WARNING LABEL PROPOSAL. AFTER A TASK FORCE FURTHER STUDIED THE ISSUE, THE FDA IN 2010 ORDERED MANUFACTURERS TO REVISE LABELS TO INCLUDE A WARNING, WHICH MERCK DID.  THE PLAINTIFFS CONTEND THAT THE FDA REJECTED ONLY MERCK\u2019S PROPOSED LANGUAGE FOR THE WARNING THAT FOCUSED ON RELATIVELY MINOR STRESS FRACTURES RATHER THAN THE MORE SERIOUS FRACTURES THEY SUFFERED.  IN A DECISION WRITTEN BY JUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER, THE SUPREME COURT SAID A DRUG MANUFACTURER MUST SHOW IT \u201cFULLY INFORMED\u201d THE FDA OF THE NEED FOR A WARNING BEFORE IT WAS REBUFFED AND THAT JUDGES, NOT JURIES, MUST DECIDE WHETHER SUCH LAWSUITS ARE PREEMPTED, AS MERCK HAS CLAIMED. LOWER COURTS NOW MUST REVISIT THE CASE REFLECTING THE SUPREME COURT\u2019S GUIDANCE.  MERCK\u2019S SHARES WERE FLAT ON MONDAY.  FOSAMAX HELPS PREVENT AND TREAT OSTEOPOROSIS, A CONDITION THAT CAN LEAD TO BONE FRACTURES, IN WOMEN WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH MENOPAUSE. BUT IT MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF FRACTURES IN THE THIGH BONE OR JUST BELOW THE HIP JOINT, OFTEN REQUIRING SURGICAL INTERVENTION.  \u2018FULLY COMMITTED\u2019  IN A STATEMENT, MERCK SAID IT WAS PLEASED WITH THE DECISION AND \u201cREMAINS FULLY COMMITTED TO DEFENDING THESE CASES GOING FORWARD AND WILL CONTINUE TO PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT IT ACTED APPROPRIATELY AT ALL TIMES IN REGARD TO THE POTENTIAL RISK OF ATYPICAL FEMUR FRACTURES.\u201d  DAVID FREDERICK, AN ATTORNEY FOR THE FOSAMAX USERS WHO SUED MERCK, SAID MONDAY\u2019S DECISION REAFFIRMS PATIENTS\u2019 ABILITY TO HOLD DRUG COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE. \u201cTHIS OPINION PROTECTS ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR INJURED PATIENTS,\u201d FREDERICK SAID.  SALES OF FOSAMAX, ALSO AVAILABLE AS A GENERIC DRUG, TOTALED $209 MILLION IN 2018, ACCORDING TO NEW JERSEY-BASED MERCK.  FOSAMAX USERS SUED MERCK, ALLEGING THE DRUG CAUSED THEM TO SUSTAIN SERIOUS THIGH BONE FRACTURES AND THAT THE COMPANY FAILED TO WARN OF THE RISK. THE NUMBER OF CASES HAS SWELLED TO MORE THAN 1,000.  A FEDERAL TRIAL COURT IN NEW JERSEY THREW OUT THE CASES, BUT IN 2017 THE 3RD CIRCUIT ALLOWED THE CLAIMS TO PROCEED TO TRIAL, RULING THAT A JURY COULD FIND THAT THE FDA HAD OBJECTED ONLY TO MERCK\u2019S PHRASING OF THE PROPOSED WARNING LABEL.  ON MONDAY, THREE JUSTICES - JOHN ROBERTS, SAMUEL ALITO AND BRETT KAVANAUGH - AGREED WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE CASE BUT DID NOT JOIN BREYER\u2019S DECISION. IN A SEPARATE OPINION, ALITO SIGNALED SYMPATHY FOR MERCK, NOTING THE FDA HAD LONG BEEN AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND WAS COMMUNICATING WITH DRUG MANUFACTURERS, AND NOTED THAT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP\u2019S ADMINISTRATION ALSO BACKS MERCK\u2019S POSITION.", "Ticker": "MRK", "Date": "2019-05-20T00:00:00", "key": "20190520MRK", "labelr0": 0.2032520325203209, "labelr1": 0.7860040567951377, "labelr2": 1.8616352201257915, "labelr3": 0.04939491232402079, "labelr4": 0.185139471735381, "pos": 0.25, "neg": 0.264, "compound": 0.2023, "0_day_return": 0.203252032520318, "1_day_return": 0.7860040567951421, "2_day_return": 2.6622718052738525, "3_day_return": 2.712981744421916, "4_day_return": 2.9031440162272, "label": 1, "return": 0.008495835608354471, "excess_return": 0.7775082211867876, "count_of_word": 606, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.50914305, "prof1": 0.49085692, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5462042740183362, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4537957259816639, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.50914305, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.49085692, "vader_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.39975286, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.6002470999999999, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5359199, "tr_prof1": 0.46408009999999994, "fst_spacy_pred2": 1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.63675475, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.36324522, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": 1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.45162532, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.5483748, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.5746704, "headline_prof21": 0.4253295999999999, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.42916992, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.57083005, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.5094332, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.49056688, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.61849546, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.38150459999999997, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": 1, "returnpred": -0.7860040567951421, "returnpredvader": 0.7860040567951421, "returnpredsgd": -0.7860040567951421, "returnfst_spacy_pred": 0.7860040567951421, "returnfst_sentencepc_pred2": 0.7860040567951421, "returnheadline_pred": -0.7860040567951421, "returntextplusheadline_pred": 0.7860040567951421, "returntr_headlineplustext_pred": -0.7860040567951421, "returntr_headline_pred": -0.7860040567951421, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9988448674418348, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.0064212449241183, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9995893186615816, "dailyaveragereturnfst_spacy_pred": 1.0037808532809633, "dailyaveragereturnfst_sentencepc_pred2": 0.0, "dailyaveragereturnreturnfst_sentencepc_pred2": 0.9974526745624761, "dailyaveragereturnreturnheadline_pred": 0.9949879753450093, "dailyaveragereturnreturntextplusheadline_pred": 0.9966829093721804, "dailyaveragereturnreturntr_headlineplustext_pred": 1.0052654929742482, "dailyaveragereturnreturntr_headline_pred": 1.0056553720697834, "cumreturn1b": 1.6258078277798833, "cumreturn1d": 1.2109572290292614, "cumreturn1e": 1.2659456347419709, "cumreturn1f": 0.9297050610458506, "cumreturn1g": 0.0, "cumreturn1h": 0.9536201358520594, "cumreturn1i": 1.0546572101715668, "cumreturn1j": 1.5076498733477708, "cumreturn1k": 1.421765194620488, "cumreturndow": 1.1411656728828725, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1084153087876611}, {"Unnamed: 0": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6977, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 6977, "level_0": 6977, "index": 6977, "text": "CHICAGO, MAY 21 (REUTERS) - JPMORGAN CHASE & CO SAID ON TUESDAY THAT ONLY 71.64 PERCENT OF SHAREHOLDERS VOTED TO APPROVE ITS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PACKAGES, MARKING A RARE INSTANCE OF CRITICISM OVER THE BANK\u2019S TOP LEADERS PAY.

A WOMAN HOLDS A \"HEATED TOBACCO\" IQOS DEVICE, MADE BY PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL, IN AN INSTAGRAM POST UNDER AN ACCOUNT CALLED @IQOSTYLE.ARM, WHICH HAS THE HASHTAG #IQOSARMENIA, IN A POST FROM MAY 12, 2019. @IQOSTYLE.ARM/SOCIAL MEDIA  THE MORE THAN 100 ORGANIZATIONS FROM 48 COUNTRIES THAT SIGNED THE LETTER, WHICH WAS SENT TO THE COMPANIES FRIDAY AND PUBLICLY RELEASED WEDNESDAY, INCLUDED THE CAMPAIGN FOR TOBACCO-FREE KIDS, THE JAPAN SOCIETY FOR TOBACCO CONTROL AND THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS.  REUTERS EARLIER THIS MONTH DOCUMENTED HOW PHILIP MORRIS HAD USED YOUNG SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS, INCLUDING A 21-YEAR-OLD WOMAN IN RUSSIA, TO PROMOTE ITS IQOS DEVICE. THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERNAL MARKETING STANDARDS PROHIBIT IT FROM USING YOUTH-ORIENTED CELEBRITIES OR \u201cMODELS WHO ARE OR APPEAR TO BE UNDER THE AGE OF 25.\u201d  PHILIP MORRIS SAID MAY 10 THAT IT LAUNCHED AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION AND SUSPENDED ALL \u201cPRODUCT-RELATED DIGITAL INFLUENCER ACTIONS GLOBALLY\u201d AFTER REUTERS SOUGHT THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMENT ON EXAMPLES OF INSTAGRAM POSTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS DEPICTING YOUNG, HIP WOMEN ADVERTISING IQOS.  YOUNG WOMEN ARE PICTURED WITH THE IQOS \"HEATED TOBACCO\" DEVICE, MADE BY PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL, AT AN IQOS-SPONSORED VIP LOUNGE AT AN APRIL\u00caMUSIC FESTIVAL\u00caIN COLOMBIA ON AN INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT SINCE REMOVED FROM THE PHOTOGRAPHER'S ACCOUNT. @REPOCAMERA/SOCIAL MEDIA VIA REUTERS  PHILIP MORRIS SUSPENDS MARKETING, THEN DEFENDS IT  ALL OF THE POSTS REFERENCED IN THE REUTERS REPORT REMAINED ONLINE AS OF TUESDAY EVENING. IN ADDITION, REUTERS HAS IDENTIFIED NEW EXAMPLES OF INSTAGRAM CONTENT FEATURING YOUNG PEOPLE WITH THE IQOS POSTED IN THE DAYS SINCE PHILIP MORRIS SAID IT HAD SUSPENDED ITS INFLUENCER CAMPAIGNS.  SEVERAL POSTS UNDER THE INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT @IQOS_EGYPT OVER THE PAST WEEK HAVE FEATURED YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN USING THE DEVICE AT BARS OR COCKTAIL EVENTS. OTHER POSTS FROM ACCOUNTS USING THE IQOS NAME IN POLAND, ARMENIA, ITALY AND IRAN OVER THE LAST WEEK ALSO SHOWED YOUNG, TRENDY MEN AND WOMEN USING THE DEVICES.  OTHER POSTS EMERGED OVER THE LAST WEEK FROM A PHOTOGRAPHER WHO DOCUMENTED AN IQOS-SPONSORED VIP LOUNGE AT AN APRIL MUSIC FESTIVAL IN COLOMBIA.  A REPRESENTATIVE FOR AN IQOS STORE IN SARNO, ITALY, SAID EMPLOYEES FOUND THE RECENT PHOTOS OF WOMEN USING IQOS ELSEWHERE ONLINE AND REPOSTED THEM ON THE STORE\u2019S INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT. A REPRESENTATIVE OF AN IQOS-BRANDED INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT IN ARMENIA DENIED BEING PAID BY PHILIP MORRIS TO PROMOTE THE PRODUCT.  OTHER INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT OWNERS PROMOTING IQOS DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT. NONE OF THE INFLUENCERS MENTIONED IN THE MAY 10 REUTERS REPORT RESPONDED TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT ON WHETHER THEY HAD BEEN ASKED TO STOP POSTING OR REMOVE POSTS MARKETING PHILIP MORRIS PRODUCTS.  PHILIP MORRIS SPOKESMAN RYAN SPARROW SAID THE FIRM HAD \u201cDIRECTED THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO NEW POSTS\u201d BY INFLUENCERS. SPARROW DID NOT RESPOND TO QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE COMPANY HAD STOPPED PAYING INFLUENCERS OR ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE EXISTING POSTS.  SPARROW SAID SOME OF THE NEW POSTS \u201cSEEM TO ORIGINATE FROM THIRD PARTIES, NOT PMI, AND IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE DO NOT SELL IQOS,\u201d NOTING EQYPT AND IRAN.  SPARROW DEFENDED THE SUSPENDED MARKETING CAMPAIGN AS A VITAL WAY TO INFORM ADULT CIGARETTE SMOKERS ABOUT SAFER OPTIONS. HE BLASTED THE CAMPAIGN FOR TOBACCO-FREE KIDS FOR \u201cTRYING TO PRESSURE US ... TO EFFECTIVELY BLOCK THESE CHANNELS\u201d AND \u201cIN EFFECT PERPETUATING THE CONSUMPTION OF TOBACCO IN ITS MOST HARMFUL FORM: COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES.\u201d  CAROLINE RENZULLI, A SPOKESWOMAN FOR THE ANTI-TOBACCO CAMPAIGN, CALLED IT \u201cLAUGHABLE\u201d THAT PHILIP MORRIS USED SOCIAL MEDIA TO MARKET TO ADULTS.  PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL HAS LICENSED ALTRIA GROUP INC TO MARKET THE IQOS DEVICE IN THE UNITED STATES BEGINNING THIS SUMMER.  ALTRIA, WHICH SELLS MARLBORO CIGARETTES IN THE UNITED STATES, HAS PREVIOUSLY SAID IT HAS A POLICY OF NOT ADVERTISING ON SOCIAL MEDIA. HOWEVER, AN ONLINE JOB POSTING FROM THE COMPANY IN MARCH SEEKS A \u201cDIGITAL MARKETING SPECIALIST\u201d FOR THE \u201cIQOS BRAND TEAM.\u201d THE IDEAL CANDIDATE WILL DEVELOP MARKETING STRATEGY FOR \u201cE-COMMERCE, OWNED WEBSITES, SOCIAL MEDIA AND INFLUENCERS.\u201d  ALTRIA SPOKESMAN DAVID SUTTON SAID THE COMPANY HAS NO PLANS TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS TO MARKET IQOS BUT DID NOT RESPOND TO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE JOB POSTING MENTIONING AN INFLUENCER STRATEGY.  ELICENA ANDRADA, A MODEL FROM SPAIN WHOSE BIOGRAPHY LISTS SHE WAS CROWNED MISS AMERICA LATINO DEL MUNDO IN 2017, HOLDS AN IQOS \"HEATED TOBACCO\" DEVICE, MADE BY PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL IN AN INSTAGRAM POST ON AN ACCOUNT CALLED @IQOS_FRIENDS, IN A POST FROM MAY 12, 2019. @IQOS_FRIENDS/SOCIAL MEDIA VIA REUTERS  REGULATORY GRAY AREA  THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) LAST MONTH DECIDED TO ALLOW U.S. SALES OF THE IQOS DEVICE AFTER A TWO-YEAR REVIEW PROCESS IN WHICH PHILIP MORRIS REPEATEDLY ASSURED THE REGULATOR THAT IT WOULD WARN YOUNG PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE PRODUCT.  DIGITAL ADVERTISING OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS REMAINS A GRAY AREA FOR REGULATORS GLOBALLY. TOBACCO ADVERTISING REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ELSEWHERE WERE WRITTEN BEFORE THE RISE OF SOCIAL MEDIA MARKETING.  THE FDA, HOWEVER, CAN EXERT AUTHORITY OVER THE DIGITAL MARKETING OF NEW DEVICES IT CLEARS FOR SALE. AS A CONDITION OF ALLOWING PHILIP MORRIS TO SELL THE IQOS DEVICE, THE AGENCY REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE DETAILED ANALYSES OF THE AGE RANGES OF CONSUMERS IT REACHES WITH ONLINE MARKETING.

AYAME TACHIBANA/SOCIAL MEDIA VIA REUTERS/FILE PHOTO  PHILIP MORRIS, THROUGH ALTRIA, IS ALSO REQUIRED TO SUBMIT INFORMATION ON ANY NEW U.S. ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS TO THE FDA AT LEAST 30 DAYS BEFORE IT PLANS TO LAUNCH THEM.  A GLOBAL TREATY GOVERNING TOBACCO REGULATIONS, UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, URGES COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE TO ENTIRELY BAN TOBACCO ADVERTISING. A 2018 WHO REPORT ABOUT TOBACCO PROMOTION IN ENTERTAINMENT AND SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS ACKNOWLEDGED THE CHALLENGES OF REGULATING IT.

FILE PHOTO: ANADARKO PETROLEUM CORPORATION IS SEEN IN THE WOODLANDS, TEXAS, U.S., APRIL 30, 2019. REUTERS/LOREN ELLIOTT/FILE PHOTO  IT ALSO QUADRUPLED ITS DEBT - TO $40 BILLION - AT A TIME WHEN INVESTORS ARE CALLING FOR SPENDING CUTS AND HIGHER DIVIDENDS.  THAT MEANS THE ACQUISITION\u2019S SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON HOW QUICKLY OCCIDENTAL CAN SELL OFF SOME OF ANADARKO\u2019S ASSETS AND FOCUS ON OPTIMIZING AND INTEGRATING THE ASSETS IT KEEPS - ESPECIALLY PRIME U.S. SHALE FIELDS.  SHEDDING DEBT WILL REQUIRE SELLING ASSETS WHEN DEALS HAVE BEEN SLUGGISH, SAID BANKERS AND MERGER SPECIALISTS. THE NUMBER OF U.S. DEALS HAS FALLEN TO LOWS NOT SEEN IN FIVE YEARS OR MORE AS INVESTOR DEMANDS FOR CAPITAL DISCIPLINE HAVE DRIVEN BUYERS FROM THE MARKET, SAID TODD DITTMANN, MANAGING DIRECTOR AT INVESTMENT FIRM ANGELO GORDON.  \u201cAN ACQUISITION IS MORE OFTEN VIEWED AS A CONFESSION OF POOR DRILLING LOCATIONS AND A FAILURE OF PRIOR STRATEGY,\u201d DITTMANN SAID.  DEAL-MAKERS SAY CHIEF EXECUTIVE VICKI HOLLUB\u2019S MOST LIKELY SALE PROSPECTS ARE ANADARKO\u2019S OFFSHORE ASSETS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO AND ITS PIPELINE BUSINESS. HER CHALLENGE WILL BE TO BALANCE SUCH SALES WITH THE NEED FOR THEIR CASH FLOW TO PAY DEBT AND DIVIDENDS.  HOLLUB ALREADY HAS ONE BIG SALE LINED UP: FRANCE\u2019S TOTAL SA AGREED TO PAY $8.8 BILLION FOR ANADARKO\u2019S OIL-AND-GAS PRODUCING ASSETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING ITS BIGGEST FUTURE EXPENSE, A MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS PROJECT IN MOZAMBIQUE.  OCCIDENTAL DECLINED TO COMMENT, BUT CEO HOLLUB TOLD SHAREHOLDERS AND ANALYSTS SHE EXPECTS TO SQUEEZE $3.5 BILLION PER YEAR IN COST SAVINGS AND CAPITAL SPENDING CUTS FROM THE DEAL, AND IS EAGER TO APPLY THE COMPANY\u2019S PERMIAN BASIN EXPERTISE TO ANADARKO\u2019S TEXAS AND COLORADO OIL FIELDS.  \u201cWE WILL MAKE THIS WORK,\u201d HOLLUB VOWED. \u201cWE WILL GET THESE SYNERGIES.\u201d  \u2018AMAZING\u2019 CASH FLOW  SEVERAL MAJOR OIL COMPANIES WOULD BE WILLING TO BUY THE GULF OF MEXICO OFFSHORE ASSETS, OR ANY PERMIAN ACREAGE IF OCCIDENTAL DECIDED TO SELL SOME OF ITS LONG-HELD PROPERTIES. IT CONTROLS ABOUT 2.7 MILLION ACRES THERE ALREADY, SPLIT BETWEEN SHALE AND CONVENTIONAL PRODUCTION, AND WITH THE ANADARKO DEAL WILL ACQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL 240,000 ACRES IN ONE OF THE MORE PRODUCTIVE AREAS OF THE PERMIAN BASIN.  THE GULF OF MEXICO BUSINESS PROVIDED NEARLY A QUARTER OF ANADARKO\u2019S OIL AND GAS OUTPUT WHILE CONSUMING JUST 19 PERCENT OF PRODUCTION SPENDING. HOLLUB HAS PRAISED IT FOR ITS \u201cAMAZING FREE CASH FLOW,\u201d AND M&A ANALYSTS SAY COULD BE WORTH AT LEAST $6 BILLION.  POTENTIAL BUYERS WOULD BE THE HANDFUL OF LARGE COMPANIES WITH DEEPWATER EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING ROYAL DUTCH SHELL, EXXON MOBIL, TOTAL AND CHEVRON.  ANOTHER REASON TO SELL IT: OCCIDENTAL HAS NEVER OPERATED IN THE GULF BEFORE. THAT RAISES CONCERNS AMONG INVESTORS, SAID JENNIFER ROWLAND, AN ANALYST WITH EDWARD JONES.  \u201cIT JUST ADDS TO THE RISK OF A DEAL. THEY DON\u2019T HAVE THAT KNOWLEDGE IN HOUSE,\u201d SHE SAID.  IN THE \u2018DOGHOUSE\u2019 WITH INVESTORS  ANOTHER LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR A SALE IS WESTERN MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, ANADARKO\u2019S MAJORITY-OWNED GAS GATHERING AND PIPELINE BUSINESS, VALUED AT AROUND $7.5 BILLION. OCCIDENTAL HAS PREVIOUSLY SOLD OFF PIPELINES AND COASTAL TERMINALS. THE COMPANY\u2019S VIEW OF PIPELINE ASSETS, SAID FINANCE CHIEF CEDRIC BURGHER TO ANALYSTS, IS \u201cYOU DON\u2019T NEED TO OWN\u201d THEM, ONLY TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THEM.  IF HOLLUB CAN SELL THE OFFSHORE BUSINESS AND CLOSE THE DEAL WITH TOTAL, SHE COULD HIT A $10 BILLION TO $15 BILLION DIVESTMENT TARGET, SAID MATT SALLEE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT INVESTMENT FIRM TORTOISE CAPITAL ADVISORS. THAT COULD MAKE IT LESS LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WOULD SELL ANY OF ITS ONSHORE OR PIPELINE OPERATIONS, HE SAID.  \u201cTHEY WOULD PROBABLY REALLY LIKE TO GET ANOTHER SALE DONE BEFORE THE DEAL CLOSES TO REMOVE THIS RISK\u201d OF TOO MUCH DEBT, SAID CHARLES JOHNSTON, ANALYST AT DEBT RESEARCH FIRM CREDITSIGHTS.  \u201cTHE LONGER THEY TAKE\u201d TO REDUCE DEBT FROM THE DEAL, \u201cTHE LONGER THEY STAY IN THE DOGHOUSE WITH INVESTORS,\u201d SAID ROWLAND.  OCCIDENTAL\u2019S STOCK FELL TO A 10-YEAR-LOW AFTER IT REACHED A MERGER AGREEMENT WITH ANADARKO AND ANALYSTS AT WELLS FARGO, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS AND EDWARD JONES LOWERED RATINGS ON THE COMPANY.  RATING FIRMS ARE FORECASTING A DEBT DOWNGRADE BECAUSE OF THE DEAL, THOUGH NONE EXPECT OCCIDENTAL WILL FALL INTO JUNK BOND STATUS. MOODY\u2019S INVESTORS SERVICE SAID A \u201cWEAKLY POSITIONED INVESTMENT GRADE RATING\u201d IS THE MOST LIKELY FOR OCCIDENTAL.  THE SPREAD ON ITS 2027 BONDS WIDENED A MODEST 50 BASIS POINTS SINCE THE DEAL WAS STRUCK.  \u201cTHE COMPANY DOES HAVE A GOOD TRACK RECORD OF BEING ABLE TO SELL NONCORE ASSETS AT GOOD PRICES,\u201d SAID CAROL LEVENSON, DIRECTOR AT CORPORATE BOND RESEARCH FIRM GIMME CREDIT.  IN ADDITION TO PAYING OFF THE DEAL\u2019S DEBT, HOLLUB NEEDS CASH TO COVER DIVIDENDS DUE SHAREHOLDERS AND BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC, WHICH NEGOTIATED AN 8 PERCENT ANNUAL PAYOUT ON A $10 BILLION INVESTMENT TO HELP FUND THE ANADARKO DEAL.

REUTERS/NICK OXFORD/FILE PHOTO/FILE PHOTO  STAYING FOCUSED ON SHALE  WHAT HOLLUB DOESN\u2019T WANT TO SELL IS THE MERGER\u2019S TOP PRIZE, ANADARKO\u2019S ACREAGE IN THE TOP U.S. SHALE FIELD, THE PERMIAN BASIN. ANADARKO\u2019S PROPERTIES THERE ARE VALUED AT ABOUT $18 BILLION, ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH FIRM DRILLINGINFO.

TARIFFS ON CHINESE IMPORTS ARE A CONCERN, AS PVH SOURCES A MAJORITY OF ITS APPAREL, FOOTWEAR AND ACCESSORIES FROM THE ASIAN COUNTRY. IN 2018, THE COMPANY IMPORTED ABOUT $400 MILLION OF INVENTORY FROM CHINA.  EARLIER THIS MONTH, U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP ESCALATED THE TRADE WAR BY RAISING TARIFFS ON $200 BILLION WORTH OF CHINESE GOODS TO 25% FROM 10%. THIS WAS IN ADDITION TO THE 25% TARIFF ON $50 BILLION WORTH OF CHINESE IMPORTS ALREADY IN PLACE.  CHIRICO, IN AN INTERVIEW ON CNBC, SAID THE LATEST DISCUSSIONS ON TARIFF AND TRADE ISSUES, WHICH INCLUDES PROPOSED TARIFFS ON A FURTHER $300 BILLION WORTH CHINESE IMPORTS, WAS NOT HIS MAIN CONCERN.  \u201cTHAT (TARIFFS) IS NOT THE ISSUE GOING FORWARD... WHAT WE\u2019RE SEEING IS A SLOWDOWN IN GROWTH AND A SLOWDOWN IN RETAIL SALES,\u201d HE TOLD CNBC, HIGHLIGHTING A SLOWDOWN IN INTERNATIONAL TOURISM IN THE UNITED STATES AND A STRONG DOLLAR.  \u201cWE\u2019VE REALLY SEEN SOME SOFTNESS IN THE BUSINESS,\u201d HE SAID.  PVH PROJECTED A 10 CENT CUT IN ITS FULL-YEAR ADJUSTED PROFIT PER SHARE DUE TO THE STRONG DOLLAR. IT NOW EXPECTS 2019 ADJUSTED PROFIT BETWEEN $10.20 AND $10.30 PER SHARE, WHICH INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE LATEST ROUND OF TARIFFS. WALL STREET WAS EXPECTING $10.42 PER SHARE, ON AVERAGE.  \u201cOF COURSE THE CEO\u2019S COMMENT IS MAKING INVESTORS NERVOUS. AND HE DIDN\u2019T REALLY MINCE WORDS, BEYOND AVOIDING THE TARIFF SUBJECT,\u201d PAULA ROSENBLUM, CO-FOUNDER OF RETAIL RESEARCH FIRM RSR RESEARCH SAID.

IN JUNE 2018, SUPREME COURT MINISTER RICARDO LEWANDOWSKI ISSUED A PRELIMINARY OPINION SAYING THE \u201cSALE OF SHARES IN PUBLIC COMPANIES, OF MIXED CAPITAL FIRMS AND OF SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRES PREVIOUS LEGISLATIVE AUTHORIZATION.\u201d  HOWEVER, KEY ASSET SALES LATER GOT THE GO-AHEAD FROM BRAZIL\u2019S SLIGHTLY LOWER SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT, OR STJ, AND FROM BRAZIL\u2019S SOLICITOR-GENERAL.  LAST MONTH, ANOTHER SUPREME COURT (STF) MINISTER, EDSON FACHIN, ISSUED A DECISION UPHOLDING LEWANDOWSKI\u2019S OPINION, CALLING THE STJ DECISION CONTRADICTORY. THAT DECISION WAS ISSUED IN RESPONSE TO A LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY A UNION, IRKED BY PETROBRAS\u2019 TAG GAS PIPELINE UNIT, WHICH IT AGREED TO SELL TO FRANCE\u2019S ENGIE SA IN APRIL FOR $8.6 BILLION.  THE EVENTUAL DECISION, DUE LATER ON WEDNESDAY, WILL HAVE REPERCUSSIONS ON THE TAG SALE, BUT ALSO ON PETROBRAS\u2019 UPCOMING DIVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED GIVEN THEIR SIMILARITIES TO THE TAG SALE.  RELATED COVERAGE BRAZIL COURT RULING AFFECTING PETROBRAS SALES PUSHED TO THURSDAY  SINCE LAST WEEK, PETROBRAS REPRESENTATIVES AND THE GOVERNMENT OF FAR-RIGHT PRESIDENT JAIR BOLSONARO HAVE ENGAGED IN A FULL COURT PRESS WITH STF MINISTERS IN THE HOPE OF GETTING A FAVORABLE COURT DECISION. TWO PETROBRAS SOURCES INVOLVED IN THE CASE TOLD REUTERS THEY THOUGHT THOSE EFFORTS WOULD PAY OFF.

THE ALIBABA PROGRAMME, CALLED A100 AND WHICH COUNTS NESTLE SA AND PROCTER & GAMBLE CO AS CLIENTS, IS PART OF A MAJOR PUSH BY E-COMMERCE GIANTS IN CHINA TO RETOOL THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH MERCHANTS - OFFERING THEM A TROVE OF SHOPPER DATA IN RETURN FOR BROADER AND CLOSER PARTNERSHIPS.  THE SHIFT IS INTEGRAL TO WHAT CHINESE E-COMMERCE FIRMS CALL \u2018NEW RETAIL\u2019 OR \u2018BOUNDARY-LESS RETAIL\u2019 - THE MARRYING OF DATA AVAILABLE FROM INTERNET SHOPPING AND GATHERED THROUGH BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORES TO PROVIDE HIGHLY PERSONALISED SERVICES.  IT HAS BEEN ENABLED BY THE WIDESPREAD USE OF PAYMENTS BY SMARTPHONE, THE RISE OF FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY AND CHINESE CONSUMER TOLERANCE OF DATA-SHARING BETWEEN BUSINESSES.  OTHER SERVICES ALIBABA OFFERS TO RETAIL CLIENTS INCLUDE SHOPPER MOVEMENT \u2018HEAT MAPS\u2019 TO HELP STORES BETTER DESIGN THE LAYOUT OF PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS ITS CHAT APP DINGTALK TO COMMUNICATE WITHIN THEIR OWN COMPANIES AND WITH CUSTOMERS.

THAT CONTRIBUTED TO A 60% PERCENT RISE IN HUGGIES SALES ON JD.COM IN 2018, THE CHINESE FIRM SAID.  A SPOKESMAN FOR KIMBERLY CLARK, WHICH OWNS THE HUGGIES BRAND, DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE DETAILS OF ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH JD.COM.  AFTER A TRIAL RUN OF A NEW PRODUCT, JD.COM SAID IT CREATES A \u2018PROFILE\u2019 OF A POTENTIAL BUYER BASED ON EARLY SALES THAT IS CROSS-CHECKED WITH ITS ENTIRE USERBASE, BEFORE TARGETED ADS ARE SENT TO CLOSE MATCHES.  OTHER TOOLS JD.COM OFFERS TO RETAIL CLIENTS INCLUDE AN CUSTOMER SERVICE CHATBOT POWERED BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT CAN THE \u201cSENSE\u201d THE MOOD OF CUSTOMERS, AND ADJUST ITS TONE TO APPEAR MORE EMPATHETIC.

WHERE PREVIOUSLY BESTORE AND NESTLE WOULD HAVE DEALT WITH DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ALIBABA EMPIRE FOR DELIVERY, PAYMENTS, CLOUD COMPUTING AND MESSAGING, THEY NOW WORK WITH ONE ALIBABA TEAM DEDICATED TO THEIR COMPANY WHICH ORGANISES A RANGE OF TAILORED SERVICES.  \u201cIT\u2019S A CHANGE THAT SUBVERTS THE WAY OUR ENTIRE COMPANY HAS OPERATED,\u201d ALIBABA\u2019S JET JING TOLD REUTERS IN AN INTERVIEW.

ALIBABA HAS NOT DISCLOSED HOW MANY COMPANIES ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN ITS A100 PROGRAMME, BUT SOME ANALYSTS SAY FOR NOW ONLY BIG FIRMS WILL BE ABLE TO BENEFIT AS SMALLER FIRMS DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO JUSTIFY MAJOR ORGANISATIONAL CHANGES.  ONE RISK FOR RETAILERS, HOWEVER, IS THAT THEY MAY BECOME OVERLY DEPENDENT ON THEIR E-COMMERCE PARTNERS.  THE CHINESE MARKET REMAINS TOUGH FOR BRANDS TO CRACK INDEPENDENTLY AND ALIBABA AND JD.COM REPRESENT THE TWO BIGGEST ONLINE RETAIL CHANNELS INTO THE COUNTRY. IN THE FACE OF SUCH TOUGH COMPETITION, AMAZON.COM INC SAID IN APRIL IT IS SHUTTING ITS CHINA ONLINE STORE.  \u201cIT\u2019S A MUST FOR THE BRANDS TO BE INVOLVED,\u201d SAYS BAIN & COMPANY\u2019S DING. \u201cBUT EVERYONE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A BALANCE AND NOT PUT THEIR EGGS IN ONE BASKET.\u201d  MORE BROADLY, QUESTIONS REMAIN OVER HOW BIG E-COMMERCE FIRMS MANAGE THEIR DATA IN A WAY THAT IS FAIR TO ALL PARTIES USING THEIR SERVICES.  EU REGULATORS IN SEPTEMBER LAUNCHED A PRELIMINARY ANTITRUST INVESTIGATION INTO AMAZON OVER CONCERNS IT IS COLLECTING SIMILAR DATA FROM BRANDS THAT IT MIGHT USE TO BOOST COMPETING PRODUCTS OF ITS OWN.  ALIBABA AND JD.COM DO NOT PRODUCE THEIR OWN PRODUCTS BUT BOTH HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RETAIL STORES INCLUDING EXPERIMENTAL GROCERY AND CONVENIENCE STORE FORMATS.

SAN FRANCISCO-BASED PG&E SOUGHT CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN JANUARY IN THE AFTERMATH OF DEVASTATING WILDFIRES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN 2017 AND 2018 THAT LEFT THE COMPANY ANTICIPATING $30 BILLION IN LIABILITIES BLAMED ON ITS EQUIPMENT.  THE WORST OF THE BLAZES, NOVEMBER\u2019S CAMP FIRE, LEVELED THE TOWN OF PARADISE AND KILLED MORE THAN 80 PEOPLE. IT WAS THE DEADLIEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE OF MODERN TIMES IN CALIFORNIA.  A SPOKESMAN SAID THE COMMITTEE HAD NO ADDITIONAL COMMENT ON THE PLAN BEYOND ITS FILING.  A SPOKESMAN FOR PG&E IN AN EMAIL TO REUTERS SAID THE POWER PROVIDER IS \u201cCOMMITTED TO WORKING TOGETHER WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH THE CHAPTER 11 PROCESS TO FAIRLY AND EXPEDITIOUSLY RESOLVE OUR LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM THE 2017 AND 2018 NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES, DEVELOP A MORE SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL AND CONTINUE DELIVERING SAFE AND RELIABLE SERVICE.\u201d  THE COMMITTEE SAID IN ITS FILING THAT ITS REORGANIZATION PLAN WILL PROVIDE A \u201cSUBSTANTIAL\u201d CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO FUND IMPROVEMENTS IN PG&E\u2019S ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENSURE RELIABLE POWER SERVICE AND MEET CALIFORNIA\u2019S RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS.  THE COMMITTEE ALSO SAID ITS PLAN WILL PROVIDE FOR A QUICK EXIT FROM BANKRUPTCY FOR PG&E THAT MAINTAINS AN INVESTMENT-GRADE RATING FOR THE POWER PROVIDER.  THE COMMITTEE\u2019S FILING DID NOT IDENTIFY UNSECURED NOTEHOLDERS THAT WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE PLAN, BUT THE LARGEST STAKEHOLDERS IN THE GROUP INCLUDE PACIFIC INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CO LLC, ELLIOTT MANAGEMENT CORP AND DAVIDSON KEMPNER CAPITAL MANAGEMENT.  ACCORDING TO THE COMMITTEE\u2019S FILING, TERMS OF THE PLAN WILL NOT AFFECT PG&E\u2019S RATEPAYERS AND WILL PROVIDE FOR A $4 BILLION CONTRIBUTION TO A FUND FOR INSURING AGAINST UTILITY-RELATED WILDFIRE LIABILITIES THAT CALIFORNIA OFFICIALS ARE CONSIDERING ESTABLISHING.

THE HEADQUARTERS OF GERMANY'S DEUTSCHE BANK ARE PHOTOGRAPHED IN FRANKFURT, GERMANY, JULY 8, 2019. REUTERS/KAI PFAFFENBACH  GERMANY\u2019S LARGEST LENDER SAID ON JULY 7 IT WOULD RETAIN A \u201cFOCUSED\u201d ECM FRANCHISE AS WELL AS U.S. AND EUROPEAN EQUITY RESEARCH TEAMS AS PART OF A 7.4 BILLION EURO ($8.3 BILLION) SHAKE-UP WHICH ALL BUT ENDS ITS AMBITIONS ON WALL STREET.

DEUTSCHE BANK\u2019S PLANS TO SHRINK ITS ECM BUSINESS, WHICH INVOLVES RAISING MONEY FOR CORPORATE CLIENTS ON THE WORLD\u2019S STOCK MARKETS THROUGH IPOS AND PRIVATE PLACEMENTS, HAS LEFT SOME BANKERS QUESTIONING HOW IT CAN STILL COMPETE.  ITS FRANCHISE IS ALREADY UNDER PRESSURE. IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2019, DEUTSCHE BANK RANKED 13TH IN THE LEAGUE TABLE FOR GLOBAL EQUITY CAPITAL MARKET DEALS, DOWN FROM NINTH PLACE IN THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO, REFINITIV DATA SHOWS.  BUT IN ITS HOME MARKET, DEUTSCHE BANK WAS THIRD BIGGEST IN TERMS OF FEES IN 2018, LAGGING ITS U.S. WALL STREET RIVALS JP MORGAN (JPM.N) AND GOLDMAN SACHS (GS.N), THE DATA SHOWS.  ECM LEAGUE TABLES CAN BE VOLATILE GIVEN THERE ARE OFTEN LARGE SWINGS IN IPO VOLUMES FROM YEAR TO YEAR, WITH REVENUES FROM SUCH ACTIVITIES AT INVESTMENT BANKS ALREADY SUFFERING FROM REDUCED ISSUANCE AND FEE PRESSURE..  HOWEVER, DEUTSCHE BANK\u2019S ECM PRACTICE MADE UP JUST 3% PERCENT OF ITS TOTAL INVESTMENT BANKING REVENUE LAST YEAR AND SOURCES SAID A FALL IN PROCEEDS WOULD NOT HIT ITS BOTTOM LINE.  DEUTSCHE BANK HAS ALREADY AXED A NUMBER OF ECM BANKING ROLES IN ASIA, EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES SINCE CHIEF EXECUTIVE CHRISTIAN SEWING ANNOUNCED HIS OVERHAUL, SOURCES SAID.  VANISHING UNICORNS?  JASON COX, THE ASIA-PACIFIC HEAD OF EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS WAS LAID OFF AND TEAMS WERE DISBANDED IN JAPAN, AUSTRALIA AND MOST OF ASIA, SOURCES HAVE PREVIOUSLY SAID.  AT LEAST THREE MEMBERS OF THE LONDON TEAM LOST THEIR JOBS ON MONDAY, SOURCES SAID, AND THE ROLES OF GLOBAL HEAD OF ECM AND GLOBAL HEAD OF EQUITY SYNDICATE, RESPONSIBLE FOR RESEARCHING AND MARKETING IPOS, REMAIN VACANT.

THE PROBE HAS FOCUSED ON WHETHER THE DATA SHARING VIOLATED A 2011 CONSENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN FACEBOOK AND THE REGULATOR AND THEN WIDENED TO INCLUDE OTHER PRIVACY ALLEGATIONS.  A PERSON BRIEFED ON THE MATTER SAID THE PHONE NUMBER, FACIAL RECOGNITION AND TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION ISSUES WERE NOT PART OF THE INITIAL CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA PROBE.  SOME IN CONGRESS HAVE CRITICIZED THE REPORTED $5 BILLION PENALTY, NOTING FACEBOOK IN 2018 HAD $55.8 BILLION IN REVENUE AND $22.1 BILLION IN NET INCOME. SENATOR MARSHA BLACKBURN, A REPUBLICAN, SAID LAST WEEK THE FINE SHOULD BE $50 BILLION.  WHILE THE DEAL RESOLVES A MAJOR REGULATORY HEADACHE FOR FACEBOOK, THE SILICON VALLEY FIRM STILL FACES FURTHER POTENTIAL ANTITRUST PROBES AS THE FTC AND JUSTICE DEPARTMENT UNDERTAKE A WIDE-RANGING REVIEW OF COMPETITION AMONG THE BIGGEST U.S. TECH COMPANIES.

FILE PHOTO: A DISH NETWORK RECEIVER HANGS ON A HOUSE IN SOMERVILLE, MASSACHUSETTS, U.S., FEBRUARY 21, 2017. REUTERS/BRIAN SNYDER/FILE PHOTO  U.S. WIRELESS CARRIERS T-MOBILE US INC (TMUS.O) AND SPRINT CORP (S.N) RECEIVED REGULATORY APPROVAL ON FRIDAY FOR THEIR $26.5 BILLION MERGER ON CONDITION THEY SELL SPRINT\u2019S PREPAID WIRELESS BUSINESS AND SOME CELL SITES TO DISH, PAVING THE WAY FOR THE SATELLITE PROVIDER, WHICH OWNS $20 BILLION WORTH OF SPECTRUM, TO ENTER THE WIRELESS PHONE MARKET AS THE NO. 4 COMPANY.  THE COMPANY FACES CHALLENGES OF PAYING FOR AND ROLLING OUT THE TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS PERSUADING CONSUMERS TO LEAVE ENTRENCHED, BIGGER RIVALS THAT ARE MUCH BETTER KNOWN.  DISH FOUNDER CHARLIE ERGEN STEPPED DOWN FROM HIS ROLE AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE IN 2017 TO FOCUS ON BUILDING THE WIRELESS BUSINESS AND HAS REMAINED STEADFAST IN THE PROJECT DESPITE CONFUSION FROM ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS.  \u201cI\u2019M NOT GOING TO CONVINCE ANYBODY IN THIS CALL, SO I\u2019M GOING TO QUIT TALKING, RIGHT?\u201d ERGEN SAID DURING THE FIRST-QUARTER EARNINGS CALL AS ANALYSTS QUESTIONED THE WIRELESS STRATEGY. \u201cBUT JUST WATCH US OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS.\u201d  DISH HAS SAID IT WILL SPEND $10 BILLION ON THE SECOND PHASE OF ITS NETWORK BUILDOUT, A CUT RATE THAT CRAIG MOFFETT, AN ANALYST WITH MOFFETTNATHANSON, SAID WAS NOT POSSIBLE IN A RESEARCH NOTE ON THURSDAY.  VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS (VZ.N) SPENDS $15 BILLION ANNUALLY JUST TO MAINTAIN ITS EXISTING NETWORK, MOFFETT SAID.  \u201cTHE IDEA THAT DISH MIGHT SPEND $10B AND THEN SOMEHOW BE FINISHED IS, WELL, JUST SILLY,\u201d HE WROTE.  ANALYSTS WITH NEW STREET RESEARCH HAD A MORE POSITIVE VIEW OF DISH\u2019S CHANCES, GIVEN ITS NETWORK WILL BE BUILT FROM THE BEGINNING WITH 5G, THE NEW WIRELESS STANDARD JUST BEGINNING TO ROLL OUT.  WORKING WITH WIRELESS NETWORK ENGINEERS, NEW STREET DETERMINED THAT DISH\u2019S COSTS TO BUILD A NETWORK WOULD BE MUCH LOWER THAN COMPETITORS BECAUSE IT IS ONLY BUILDING ONE NETWORK, COMPARED TO RIVALS WHO HAVE TO MAINTAIN MULTIPLE NETWORKS, AND DISH\u2019S NETWORK WILL BE VIRTUAL AND CAN SAVE MONEY ON THE COSTS OF MAINTAINING PHYSICAL WIRELESS TOWERS.  ULTIMATELY, DISH\u2019S COST PER UNIT OF DATA WOULD BE 75% LOWER THAN VERIZON\u2019S AND 55% LOWER THAN AT&T AND T-MOBILE\u2019S, THE ANALYSTS SAID.  ON TOP OF THE $10 BILLION DISH SAID IT WILL SPEND TO BUILD THE NETWORK, IT NEEDS ANOTHER $10 BILLION TO FUND OPERATING LOSSES, NEW STREET SAID.  IN THE DEAL TERMS ANNOUNCED ON FRIDAY, DISH HAS NO RESTRICTIONS ON WHO IT CAN PARTNER WITH ON WIRELESS AS LONG AS IT CONTINUES TO OWN THE ASSETS, SAID JEFF BLUM, DISH\u2019S SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR PUBLIC POLICY AND GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS, IN AN INTERVIEW ON FRIDAY.  PREVIOUS PRESS REPORTS SAID T-MOBILE WANTED TO IMPOSE A 5% CAP ON STRATEGIC INVESTORS IN DISH.  DISH WILL HAVE NO TROUBLE IN FINDING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO BUILD ITS NETWORK, GIVEN THERE ARE MANY COMPANIES EAGER TO HELP IT TAKE ON THE THREE BIG INCUMBENTS, NEW STREET CALCULATED.  \u201cTHERE ARE A HOST OF DEEP POCKETED COMPANIES\u201d THAT WILL WANT TO SUPPORT DISH\u2019S EFFORTS, THE ANALYSTS WROTE, NAMING AMAZON.COM INC (AMZN.O) AND GOOGLE (GOOGL.O) AS TWO POSSIBLE PARTNERS.  REUTERS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT AMAZON WAS INTERESTED IN BUYING T-MOBILE ASSETS TO GET ACCESS TO ITS NETWORK.  THE NEW YORK POST PREVIOUSLY REPORTED GOOGLE WAS IN TALKS WITH DISH TO CREATE THE FOURTH CARRIER. GOOGLE SAID, \u201cTHESE CLAIMS ARE SIMPLY FALSE,\u201d IN THE REPORT.  DISH WILL NEED A PARTNER TO DEFRAY THE FINANCIAL RISKS, SAID ANALYSTS WITH RESEARCH FIRM COWEN IN A NOTE EARLIER THIS MONTH. AMAZON AND GOOGLE WOULD BE INTERESTED GIVEN THEIR WORK IN THE INTERNET OF THINGS AND CLOUD INDUSTRY, COWEN SAID.  DISH FOLLOWS IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF AT&T INC (T.N), WHICH HAS BOTH A SATELLITE TV AND WIRELESS PHONE BUSINESS. DISH COULD OFFER A SIMILAR PACKAGE BUNDLE OF TV AND WIRELESS, THE SAME WAY AT&T DOES.  UNDER FRIDAY\u2019S AGREEMENT, DISH WILL PAY $1.4 BILLION FOR SPRINT\u2019S PREPAID BUSINESS AND $3.6 BILLION THREE YEARS LATER TO BUY SPECTRUM LICENSES.  DISH WILL BE STARTING OFF WITH 9.3 MILLION USERS FROM SPRINT\u2019S PREPAID BUSINESS, COMPARED WITH U.S. CELLULAR, CURRENTLY THE FIFTH LARGEST CARRIER IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS ABOUT 5 MILLION USERS.

THIS POSES A DILEMMA FOR DRUG COMPANIES: WITH NO REAL PROSPECT OF A FINANCIAL RETURN, CAN THEY JUSTIFY THE INVESTMENT IN EXPENSIVE DEVELOPMENT AND TRIALS.

THE TRANSFER AGREEMENT WILL SEE SABIN CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THE CANDIDATE VACCINES, ONE OF WHICH - A POTENTIAL EBOLA SHOT KNOWN AS CHAD3 - HAS BEEN THROUGH MID-STAGE, PHASE II, TRIALS IN AFRICA AND COULD POSSIBLY BE USED TO HALT OR LIMIT FUTURE EBOLA EPIDEMICS.  \u201cENABLING SABIN TO BUILD ON THE SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS GSK HAS DELIVERED UP TO PHASE II INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THESE CANDIDATE VACCINES MAY HELP PREVENT POTENTIAL FUTURE OUTBREAKS,\u201d THOMAS BREUER, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER OF GSK VACCINES, SAID IN A STATEMENT.  GSK HAD PUT ITS EBOLA VACCINE WORK ON HOLD AFTER IT WAS UNABLE TO PROGRESS THE PRODUCT THROUGH FINAL STAGE, OR PHASE III, CLINICAL TRIALS TOWARD THE END OF THE 2014-16 EPIDEMIC, DUE TO A DWINDLING NUMBER OF EBOLA CASES.  U.S. DRUGMAKERS MERCK (MRK.N) AND JOHNSON & JOHNSON (JNJ.N) ARE ALSO DEVELOPING POTENTIAL VACCINES AGAINST EBOLA, AND HAVE MADE MORE PROGRESS WITH THEM THAN GSK HAD IN CLINICAL TRIALS.  THE MERCK SHOT, KNOWN AS VSV EBOV, IS CURRENTLY BEING USED IN THE ONGOING EBOLA OUTBREAK IN CONGO, WHICH WAS LAST MONTH DECLARED AN INTERNATIONAL HEALTH EMERGENCY BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO).  THE DISEASE HAS KILLED MORE THAN 1,800 PEOPLE IN THE CONGO OUTBREAK WHICH BEGAN A YEAR AGO AND HAS BECOME THE SECOND-WORST ON RECORD.

FILE PHOTO: A SIGN IS SEEN OUTSIDE A BRANCH OF LLOYDS BANK IN CENTRAL LONDON FEBRUARY 3, 2014. REUTERS/LUKE MACGREGOR/FILE PHOTO  LLOYDS ON MONDAY SAID IT WILL SET ASIDE UP TO AN EXTRA 1.8 BILLION POUNDS ($2.2 BILLION) TO SETTLE PPI CLAIMS, WHILE BARCLAYS (BARC.L) LATER SAID IT WOULD SET ASIDE BETWEEN 1.2 BILLION POUNDS AND 1.6 BILLION POUNDS.  LLOYDS ALSO SAID IT WAS SUSPENDING ITS 2019 SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM.  THE HUGE PROVISIONS SHOW HOW BANKS IN BRITAIN ARE STILL BATTLING WITH THE LEGACY OF THE SCANDAL, EVEN AFTER THE AUG. 29 DEADLINE FOR CONSUMERS TO COMPLAIN, AS A RUSH OF CUSTOMER ENQUIRIES IN THE RUN-UP TO THAT DATE FORCED THEM TO SET ASIDE MORE COMPENSATION MONEY.  PPI POLICIES WERE SOLD ALONGSIDE A PERSONAL LOAN OR MORTGAGE TO COVER REPAYMENTS IF BORROWERS FELL ILL OR LOST JOBS, BUT MANY WERE UNSUITABLE.  BRITAIN\u2019S HIGH COURT IN 2011 RULED THAT CONSUMERS COULD RETROACTIVELY SEEK COMPENSATION FOR MIS-SOLD POLICIES.  THE SUBSEQUENT RUSH OF CLAIMS HAS BEEN A BOON FOR CONSUMERS, EGGED ON BY A RISE IN SO-CALLED CLAIMS MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, WITH LENDERS HAVING PAID OUT MORE THAN 36 BILLION POUNDS IN TOTAL AND THE FINAL TALLY EXPECTED TO TOP 50 BILLION POUNDS.  RBS (RBS.L) SAID LAST WEEK IT FACED ADDITIONAL COSTS OF UP TO 900 MILLION POUNDS, WHILE CLYDESDALE BANK MADE A FRESH 300-450 MILLION POUND PROVISION.  AS BRITAIN\u2019S BIGGEST DOMESTIC LENDER, LLOYDS HAS BEEN THE MOST EXPOSED TO PPI AND HAS ALREADY PAID OUT MORE THAN 20 BILLION POUNDS.  LAST MINUTE CLAIMS  LLOYDS SAID ON MONDAY IT HAD RECEIVED 600,000-800,000 REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT PPI PER WEEK IN AUGUST, WELL ABOVE ITS EXPECTATIONS OF AROUND 190,000 PER WEEK.  AS A RESULT, IT EXPECTS TO SET ASIDE A FURTHER 1.2-1.8 BILLION POUNDS IN ITS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS TO COVER PAYOUTS.  LLOYDS ALSO SAID IT HAD RECEIVED A CLAIM SUBMITTED BY THE INSOLVENCY SERVICE\u2019S OFFICIAL RECEIVER ON BEHALF OF BANKRUPT CONSUMERS, PUSHING COSTS HIGHER.  IT ADDED THE CHARGE WOULD DENT ITS PROFITABILITY AND IT SCRAPPED GUIDANCE FOR A RETURN ON TANGIBLE EQUITY OF AROUND 12% THIS YEAR. IT ALSO WARNED THE INCREASE IN ITS CAPITAL RATIO IN 2019 WOULD BE BELOW ITS 170-200 BASIS POINTS PER ANNUM GUIDANCE.  BARCLAYS SAID IT STILL AIMS TO HOLD ITS CORE CAPITAL LEVEL AT ITS 13% TARGET BY YEAR-END.  LLOYDS MADE PPI PROVISIONS WORTH 650 MILLION POUNDS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR, MEANING THE TOTAL COMBINED COST FOR 2019 COULD HIT AS MUCH AS 2.45 BILLION POUNDS, EQUIVALENT TO 41% OF ITS 6 BILLION POUNDS PRETAX PROFIT LAST YEAR. THE BANK SET ASIDE 750 MILLION POUNDS FOR PPI IN 2018.  ANALYSTS AT BROKER KBW SAID THE TOP END OF THE LLOYDS CHARGE AT 1.8 BILLION POUNDS WAS MARGINALLY BETTER THAN THEIR WORST CASE SCENARIO, WHILE THE BARCLAYS PROVISION WAS HIGHER THAN THE 700 MILLION POUNDS THEY HAD PREDICTED.  LLOYDS WAS GIVEN SOME BREATHING SPACE ON CAPITAL IN MAY, WHEN REGULATORS REDUCED ITS REQUIRED CORE CAPITAL RATIO TO 12.5% FROM 13%, EQUATING TO AROUND 1 BILLION POUNDS.

FABIO SCHVARTSMAN, VALE\u2019S THEN-CHIEF EXECUTIVE, SAID AT A NATIONALLY BROADCAST NEWS CONFERENCE DAYS AFTER THE DAM BURST IN LATE JANUARY THAT THE COMPANY HAD ALREADY DECOMMISSIONED NINE \u201cUPSTREAM DAMS\u201d IN THE WAKE OF A 2015 DISASTER INVOLVING THE SAME TYPE OF STRUCTURE, AND PLANNED TO DISMANTLE 10 MORE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THE COMPANY REPEATED THE CLAIM IN A STATEMENT ON ITS WEBSITE.  REUTERS ASKED VALE FOR DETAILS ON THESE MOVES ON FEBRUARY 5, SEVEN DAYS AFTER SCHVARTSMAN\u2019S NEWS CONFERENCE.  IN MARCH, SOME FIVE WEEKS LATER, VALE GAVE REUTERS A LIST OF NINE DAMS THAT IT SAID IT HAD CLOSED SINCE 2014, A YEAR BEFORE THE MARIANA DISASTER. FIVE WERE SMALLER STRUCTURES, CALLED DIKES, WHICH VALE SAID SHOULD BE CONSIDERED \u201cUPSTREAM DAMS,\u201d WHILE FOUR OTHERS WERE LISTED AS SINGLE-STEP DAMS, WHICH EXPERTS CONSIDER LESS DANGEROUS.  BUT EDUARDO LE\u00c3O, A DIRECTOR OF THE BRAZILIAN MINING REGULATOR ANM, AND ANOTHER EXPERT WHO REVIEWED THE LIST FOR REUTERS, SAID THAT THEY WERE ALL IN FACT SMALLER STRUCTURES AND NOT THE DANGEROUS UPSTREAM TYPE.  VALE ALSO LISTED THE 10 DAMS THAT IT SAID IT PLANNED TO CLOSE, INCLUDING THE COLLAPSED ONE AT BRUMADINHO.  BRAZILIAN PROSECUTORS NOW ARE LOOKING INTO SCHVARTSMAN\u2019S DECLARATION THAT VALE HAD ALREADY SHUTTERED NINE UPSTREAM DAMS IN RESPONSE TO THE 2015 COLLAPSE AS PART OF A WIDER CRIMINAL PROBE INTO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONDUCT, AN INDIVIDUAL CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION SAID. THE WIDENING OF THE PROBE HAS NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED.  FOR A GRAPHIC, CLICK TMSNRT.RS/308R1IY  THE 2015 COLLAPSE, AT ITS SAMARCO JOINT VENTURE WITH BHP GROUP, KILLED 19 PEOPLE NEAR THE TOWN OF MARIANA.  \u201cTHERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT MEASURES BEING TAKEN TO AVOID A REPETITION OF WHAT HAPPENED, BUT IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN TALK,\u201d THE SOURCE ADDED.  SCHVARTSMAN\u2019S REPRESENTATIVES AT THE LAW FIRM OF BOTTINI & TAMASAUSKAS DECLINED TO COMMENT.  IN A STATEMENT, VALE SAID THE ORIGINAL FIGURES THAT SCHVARTSMAN PROVIDED WERE BASED ON \u201cINFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME, PROVIDED BY EMPLOYEES FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S FERROUS METALS AREA AT THE TIME OF THE (NEWS CONFERENCE) AND THAT IT HAD LATER SENT REVISED DATA TO REUTERS AND OTHER NEWS OUTLETS.\u201d  VALE SAID ITS STATEMENTS SURROUNDING THE DAMS HAD BEEN MADE IN GOOD FAITH, AND ADDED THAT IT HAD DONE A LOT TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE OF THE MARIANA DISASTER AND THAT MUCH \u201cIS STILL BEING DONE.\u201d  THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT ADDS TO THE MINING GIANT\u2019S LEGAL TROUBLES. BRAZILIAN PROSECUTORS HAVE SAID THEY ARE LOOKING INTO WHETHER SENIOR VALE EXECUTIVES WERE AWARE OF STABILITY ISSUES AT BRUMADINHO AND OTHER DAMS BUT FAILED TO DISCLOSE THEM OR TAKE ADEQUATE ACTIONS TO RESOLVE THEM.  BRAZILIAN MARKET REGULATOR CVM HAS ALSO OPENED AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIVE PROBES INTO VALE\u2019S HANDLING OF THE DISASTER, WHILE THE COMPANY FACES U.S. CLASS ACTIONS AND AT LEAST ONE INVESTOR ARBITRATION CASE IN BRAZIL.  MINING WATCHDOG ANM IS CARRYING OUT A SEPARATE INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSES OF THE DAM BURST AS WELL AS WHETHER ANY MINING OR OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE RULES WERE BROKEN.  \u201cIN MY VIEW, IT\u2019S CLEAR THAT THE CEO OF ANY COMPANY, PUBLIC OR PRIVATE, WILL CERTAINLY BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY SHAREHOLDERS AND THE AUTHORITIES FOR ANY KIND OF STATEMENT, ESPECIALLY IF IT IS PROVEN TO BE UNTRUE,\u201d SAID LUIGI BONIZZATO, A PROFESSOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AT THE FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF RIO DE JANEIRO.

FOR A GRAPHIC, CLICK TMSNRT.RS/31RIPR3  SUCH DAMS ARE GENERALLY CHEAPER TO BUILD, BUT THEY RUN A HIGHER RISK OF WATER SEEPING UNDER THE DAM AND WEAKENING THE STRUCTURE, MINING EXPERTS TOLD REUTERS.  CHILE AND PERU HAVE LONG BANNED THE CONSTRUCTION OF SUCH DAMS, BECAUSE OF THE RISKS OF COLLAPSE. IN FEBRUARY, BRAZIL\u2019S ANM BANNED NEW UPSTREAM TAILINGS DAMS AND TOLD MINERS THEY HAD TO DECOMMISSION EXISTING ONES BY AUG. 15, 2023, A DEADLINE IT RECENTLY PUSHED BACK BY AS MANY AS FOUR YEARS.  VALE, THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST IRON ORE EXPORTER, IS NOT THE ONLY BIG MINER THAT OPERATES UPSTREAM DAMS.

FILE PHOTO: A MAN WALKS PAST AN OFFICE OF DEUTSCHE BANK IN HANAU, GERMANY, APRIL 27, 2015. REUTERS/KAI PFAFFENBACH  THE DISCUSSIONS IN RECENT WEEKS, WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, ARE PRELIMINARY, THE SOURCES SAID, ADDING THAT THERE IS NOTHING IMMINENT. A DEUTSCHE BANK SPOKESMAN SAID THE BANK HAS NO PLANS TO ADD ADDITIONAL ASSETS INTO THE SO-CALLED CAPITAL RELEASE UNIT, OR BAD BANK.  NEVERTHELESS, IT IS ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT HAS COME UP FOR DISCUSSION AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS AT THE BANK, AS EXECUTIVES GRAPPLE WITH THE PROBLEM OF HAVING TO TURN AROUND THE BANK ON A TIGHT BUDGET, ACCORDING TO THE THREE PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE TALKS.  DEUTSCHE BANK NEEDS MORE CAPITAL TO BE ABLE TO ABSORB THE LOSSES THAT WILL LIKELY COME FROM SHEDDING PROBLEMATIC ASSETS, SUCH AS LONG-DATED DERIVATIVES, THAT ARE STILL ON ITS BOOKS, THE PEOPLE SAID.  BUT, AFTER RAISING 29.3 BILLION EUROS ($32.3 BILLION) IN CAPITAL OVER THE PAST NINE YEARS, IT DOES NOT HAVE ROOM TO ASK INVESTORS FOR MORE, THE SOURCES ADDED.  FOR INVESTORS, STILL NURSING A 75% FALL IN THE BANK\u2019S SHARE PRICE OVER THE PAST FOUR-AND-A-HALF YEARS, IT MEANS THAT THE ROAD TO RECOVERY FOR THE BANK WILL MOST LIKELY BE LONG.  CHRISTIAN SEWING, WHO TOOK OVER FROM JOHN CRYAN IN APRIL LAST YEAR, IS LOOKING TO RESHAPE DEUTSCHE BANK AFTER A MULTI-YEAR BET ON BUILDING A GLOBAL INVESTMENT BANKING BUSINESS UNRAVELED.  IN JULY, HE SET UP THE BAD BANK, CALLED A CAPITAL RELEASE UNIT (CRU), TO HOUSE 74 BILLION EUROS OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS THE BANK HAD IDENTIFIED FOR WIND-DOWN OR SALE, PART OF A BROADER RESTRUCTURING THAT WILL SEE 18,000 JOBS GO AS IT EXITS UNPROFITABLE BUSINESSES. DEUTSCHE BANK SET ASIDE A 7.4 BILLION EURO BUDGET TO FUND THE RESTRUCTURING.  SOME ANALYSTS HAVE BEEN SKEPTICAL WHETHER THE PLAN FULLY RECOGNIZES THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM ASSETS STILL SITTING ON DEUTSCHE BANK\u2019S BALANCE SHEET. THEY REMAIN PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT ITS EXPOSURE TO LEVEL 3 ASSETS, WHICH ARE THE MOST ILLIQUID AND HARD-TO-VALUE.  \u201cIT\u2019S A PARTIAL CLEAN-UP,\u201d SAID DAVID HENDLER, AN INDEPENDENT ANALYST AT NEW YORK-BASED VIOLA RISK ADVISORS. HENDLER ADDED THAT DEUTSCHE BANK HAS 18 BILLION EUROS IN HARD-TO-VALUE ASSETS ON ITS BALANCE SHEET, WHICH HE ESTIMATED WILL TAKE YEARS TO OFFLOAD.  \u201cTHEY\u2019RE TRYING TO PAINT A PICTURE OF PROGRESS BUT THERE\u2019S STILL A LOT OF SLUDGE IN THERE,\u201d HE SAID.  LEVEL 3 ASSETS, WHICH CAN INCLUDE DISTRESSED DEBT AND DERIVATIVES, ARE NOT NECESSARILY LOSS MAKING.  DEUTSCHE BANK HAS SAID THAT THE CRU\u2019S FOCUS IS ON RELEASING CAPITAL RATHER THAN RING-FENCING TOXIC ASSETS. IN A MEMO TO STAFF ON JULY 8, SEWING DESCRIBED THE ASSETS WITHIN IT AS \u201cHIGH QUALITY\u201d AND SAID MOST WERE OF A SHORT DURATION.  ONLY 30% OF DEUTSCHE BANK\u2019S 25 BILLION EUROS WORTH OF LEVEL 3 ASSETS HAVE SO FAR BEEN PLACED WITHIN THE CAPITAL RELEASE UNIT, ACCORDING TO A PRESENTATION THE BANK GAVE ALONGSIDE ITS QUARTERLY RESULTS IN JULY.  THE BANK HAS TRIED TO SHED SOME OF THOSE ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDE LONGER-DATED DERIVATIVES, OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. BUT IT HAD LITTLE SUCCESS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT PREPARED TO TAKE THE WRITEDOWNS THE SALES WOULD HAVE REQUIRED, THE SOURCES SAID.  A SALE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET CAN LEAD TO A CAPITAL HIT IF THE PRICE IS BELOW WHAT THE BANK VALUES IT AT ON ITS BOOKS, LEADING TO A LOSS.  DEUTSCHE BANK MUST STAY WITHIN THE BUDGET IT HAS SET FOR ITS RESTRUCTURING TO AVOID HAVING TO RAISE FUNDS FROM INVESTORS, THE SOURCES SAID.  IT SET UP THE CAPITAL RELEASE UNIT WITH A VIEW TO SHEDDING ASSETS IT COULD REALISTICALLY FIND BUYERS FOR OR WIND-DOWN IN THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS, THE SOURCES SAID.

REUTERS/SERGIO MORAES  NOW, BRAZIL\u2019S MOST IMPORTANT COMPANY IS FACING YET ANOTHER CHALLENGE: THIEVES ARE ROBBING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF ITS FUEL TO SELL ON A THRIVING BLACK MARKET.  THEFT FROM PETROBRAS PIPELINES SOARED TO A RECORD HIGH 261 INCIDENTS IN THE STATES OF RIO DE JANEIRO AND SAO PAULO LAST YEAR, UP FROM JUST ONE CASE IN 2014, ACCORDING TO AN AUGUST SECURITIES FILING AND STATEMENTS MADE TO REUTERS BY REPRESENTATIVES OF PETROLEO BRASILEIRO SA (PETR4.SA), AS THE COMPANY IS FORMALLY KNOWN.  MOST OF THOSE HEISTS, POLICE SAY, ARE THE WORK OF SOPHISTICATED CRIMINAL GROUPS, SOME WITH THEIR OWN TRUCKS, DISTRIBUTION FIRMS AND EVEN RETAIL GAS STATIONS.  \u201cTHEY\u2019RE CREATIVE CREATURES,\u201d SAID JULIO DA SILVA FILHO, THE HEAD OF A RIO POLICE UNIT THAT INVESTIGATES OIL THEFT.  CRIME COSTS PETROBRAS\u2019 DISTRIBUTION SUBSIDIARY, PETROBRAS TRANSPORTE SA, OR TRANSPETRO, OVER 150 MILLION REAIS ($37 MILLION) PER YEAR, PETROBRAS CHIEF EXECUTIVE ROBERTO CASTELLO BRANCO SAID AT AN EVENT IN JUNE.  THE ALLEGED LOSSES ARE TINY COMPARED TO THOSE OF ANOTHER LATIN AMERICAN ENERGY POWERHOUSE - MEXICO - WHERE CRIME GANGS HAVE INFILTRATED THE PETROLEUM BUSINESS IN A BIG WAY. FUEL THEFT COSTS STATE-RUN PEMEX OVER $3 BILLION ANNUALLY, ACCORDING TO COMPANY FIGURES.  BUT STAMPING OUT BRAZIL\u2019S PROBLEMS EARLY, DA SILVA SAID, WILL BE CRUCIAL TO KEEPING GANGSTERS FROM BECOMING ENTRENCHED IN ITS OIL INDUSTRY.  \u201cWE\u2019RE WORKING EXACTLY TO PREVENT BRAZIL FROM TURNING INTO MEXICO,\u201d HE SAID.  TRANSPETRO HAS SET UP A PROGRAM TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE ON CRIMINAL GROUPS AND IS SPENDING 100 MILLION REAIS ($24 MILLION) A YEAR TO FUND IT, ACCORDING A HIGH-RANKING COMPANY SOURCE, WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY TO AVOID RETALIATION FROM ORGANIZED CRIME GROUPS.  AROUND 50 STAFFERS ARE NOW STUDYING THE ISSUE, INCLUDING TRACKING THE PATTERNS AND METHODS OF OIL THIEVES AND SHARING THOSE FINDINGS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE PERSON SAID. THE COMPANY, WHICH DID NOT RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT, HAS ALSO SET UP A HOTLINE FOR THE PUBLIC TO REPORT FUEL ROBBERY.  SOME FOREIGN INVESTORS, TOO, ARE BEEFING UP SECURITY. THEY INCLUDE TAG, A PIPELINE UNIT THAT FRANCE\u2019S ENGIE SA (ENGIE.PA) BOUGHT FROM PETROBRAS FOR $8.6 BILLION IN APRIL.  THE FIRM TOLD REUTERS IN A STATEMENT THAT IT IS WORKING WITH TRANSPETRO, WHOSE PIPELINES OFTEN RUN BESIDE TAG\u2019S PIPES, TO INCREASE FOOT PATROLS AND REINFORCE PHYSICAL BARRIERS, AMONG OTHER MEASURES.  \u201cTHIS PHENOMENON IS BECOMING VERY ORGANIZED,\u201d SAID EMMANUEL DELFOSSE, TAG\u2019S CHIEF OPERATIONAL OFFICER. \u201cIT\u2019S HARD TO GO AFTER THESE PEOPLE.\u201d  CRIMES OF OPPORTUNITY  FUEL IS AN EXPENSIVE COMMODITY IN BRAZIL, WHERE THE PUMP PRICE OF GASOLINE WORKS OUT TO MORE THAN $4 A GALLON.  CRIME GANGS TRADITIONALLY FOCUSED ON NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING HAVE BRANCHED OUT INTO FUEL THEFT IN RECENT YEARS, ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES. SO HAVE SO-CALLED MILITIAS, POLICE SAY, WHICH SPRANG UP TO BATTLE DRUG GANGS BUT HAVE MORPHED INTO FEARSOME CRIME OUTFITS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT.  THESE GROUPS ARE HIGHLY ORGANIZED, WITH SEPARATE DIVISIONS DEDICATED TO TAPPING ILLEGALLY INTO PIPELINES, TRANSPORTING THE STOLEN FUEL AND KEEPING A LOOKOUT FOR COPS, SAID SIMONE SIBILIO, THE HEAD PROSECUTOR FOR RIO STATE\u2019S ORGANIZED CRIME UNIT.  SHE SAID GANGSTERS FENCE THE PRODUCT THROUGH FIRMS SUCH AS ASPHALT COMPANIES WHOSE OPERATIONS REQUIRE LARGE AMOUNTS OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS. THEY ALSO SELL TO UNSCRUPULOUS GAS STATION OWNERS, UNDERCUTTING LEGAL COMPETITORS ON PRICE, AUTHORITIES SAID.  CROOKS HAVE ALSO MUSCLED INTO RETAIL SALES. POLICE SAY CRIMINALS ENTERED THE GAS STATION BUSINESS YEARS AGO AS A MEANS OF LAUNDERING CASH FROM OTHER ILLICIT OPERATIONS. NOW, STOCKING THOSE PUMPS WITH STOLEN FUEL HAS BECOME A LUCRATIVE NEW PROFIT CENTER, AUTHORITIES SAID.  FIRST CAPITAL COMMAND, ONE OF BRAZIL\u2019S MOST NOTORIOUS CRIME GANGS, CONTROLS AROUND 300 GAS STATIONS IN SAO PAULO STATE, ACCORDING TO PAULO MIRANDA, HEAD OF THE GAS STATION INDUSTRY GROUP FECOMBUSTIVEIS. THAT COMES TO AROUND 3% OF THE STATE\u2019S APPROXIMATELY 9,000 GAS STATIONS.  \u201cIT\u2019S A FUEL MAFIA,\u201d MIRANDA SAID.  FIGHTING BACK  PETROBRAS CEO CASTELLO BRANCO HAS CALLED FOR HARSHER SENTENCES FOR PIPELINE ATTACKERS TO REDUCE FUEL THEFT.  THE FIRM IS ALSO CLOSE TO SIGNING FORMAL AGREEMENTS WITH MEXICO\u2019S PEMEX AND COLOMBIA\u2019S ECOPETROL ECO.CN TO FACILITATE THE SHARING OF ANTI-THEFT STRATEGIES, THE TRANSPETRO SOURCE SAID.  NONE OF THOSE COMPANIES RESPONDED TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT.  IN THE MEANTIME, HEIGHTENED VIGILANCE APPEARS TO BE PAYING OFF. THROUGH THE END OF JULY, FUEL HEISTS IN BRAZIL WERE DOWN 33% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, PETROBRAS SECURITIES FILINGS SHOW, THOUGH THEY REMAIN HIGH BY HISTORICAL STANDARDS.  LUCAS TRIST\u00c3O, SECRETARY OF DEVELOPMENT FOR RIO STATE, SAID AUTHORITIES HAVE SHUT DOWN 10 GAS STATIONS IN RIO FOR VARIOUS CRIMES IN 2019.  SLIDESHOW (5 IMAGES)  IN JULY, POLICE BLEW THE LID OFF AN EXTORTION RACKET AT A PETROBRAS REFINERY NORTHEAST OF RIO, WHERE TRIST\u00c3O ALLEGES A LOCAL MILITIA WAS DEMANDING KICKBACKS FROM CONTRACTORS AT THE COMPLEX.  GABRIEL POIAVA, ONE OF THE DETECTIVES ON THAT CASE, SAID IT\u2019S AN EXAMPLE OF GANGSTERS LOOKING UP AND DOWN BRAZIL\u2019S OIL SUPPLY CHAIN TO SEE WHERE THEY COULD GRAB A PIECE OF THE RICHES.  \u201cIF THEY BELIEVED SOME ACTIVITY COULD BE EXTORTED THERE, THEY WOULD TRY,\u201d HE SAID.", "Ticker": "PBR", "Date": "2019-09-20T00:00:00", "key": "20190920PBR", "labelr0": 0.06882312456985401, "labelr1": 0.1375515818432005, "labelr2": -1.0989010989011, "labelr3": 0.4166666666666701, "labelr4": 0.7607192254495119, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.669, "compound": -0.7964, "0_day_return": 0.06882312456986117, "1_day_return": 0.06882312456986117, "2_day_return": -0.9628610729023211, "3_day_return": -0.5502063273727487, "4_day_return": 0.20632737276480287, "label": 1, "return": -9.69358983607796e-05, "excess_return": 0.06892006046822195, "count_of_word": 891, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5742465999999999, "prof1": 0.4257534000000001, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5185145914415188, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4814854085584812, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5742465999999999, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.4257534000000001, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.4096665, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.59033346, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.50816005, "tr_prof1": 0.49183995, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.6095813, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.39041865, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.6942786999999999, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.30572128, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.64618665, "headline_prof21": 0.35381338, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.44807762, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5519223000000001, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.36945742, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.6305425, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.4383223, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.5616777, "tr_headline_pred": 1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -0.06882312456986117, "returnpredvader": -0.06882312456986117, "returnpredsgd": -0.06882312456986117, "returnfst_spacy_pred": 0.06882312456986117, "returnfst_sentencepc_pred2": -0.06882312456986117, "returnheadline_pred": -0.06882312456986117, "returntextplusheadline_pred": 0.06882312456986117, "returntr_headlineplustext_pred": 0.06882312456986117, "returntr_headline_pred": 0.06882312456986117, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0013789648633076, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 1.000692593385423, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0024850344265908, "dailyaveragereturnfst_spacy_pred": 1.0008701921243512, "dailyaveragereturnfst_sentencepc_pred2": 0.0, "dailyaveragereturnreturnfst_sentencepc_pred2": 0.9974817093736992, "dailyaveragereturnreturnheadline_pred": 1.002680484008353, "dailyaveragereturnreturntextplusheadline_pred": 0.9958788755555487, "dailyaveragereturnreturntr_headlineplustext_pred": 1.0013876839551632, "dailyaveragereturnreturntr_headline_pred": 1.0020417070570224, "cumreturn1b": 2.4507141491359206, "cumreturn1d": 1.2284494559440078, "cumreturn1e": 1.421238109472952, "cumreturn1f": 0.9096143072719376, "cumreturn1g": 0.0, "cumreturn1h": 0.8611907889201702, "cumreturn1i": 1.0537828563749736, "cumreturn1j": 2.142742316093604, "cumreturn1k": 1.7819733114901224, "cumreturndow": 1.1919299747150554, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1543610433148777}, {"Unnamed: 0": 12051, "Unnamed: 0.1": 12051, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 12051, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 12051, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 12051, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 12051, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12051, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12051, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 12051, "level_0": 12051, "index": 12051, "text": "(REPEATS SEPT 20 STORY WITHOUT ANY CHANGES TO TEXT)    GOVERNMENT WANTS MORE LENDING TO BOOST RECOVERY    REGULATOR ASKED BANKS \u2018ONE LAST TIME\u2019 TO DEAL WITH SOURED DEBT    ANKARA LOST PATIENCE AFTER MONTHS OF TALKS, NO PROGRESS    LAST-MINUTE PLAN TO PARK LOANS IN AN ASSET MGR FAILED TO IMPRESS    STATE BANKS COULD BENEFIT FROM HIGHER NPL RATIOS  BY ORHAN COSKUN, EBRU TUNCAY, CAN SEZER AND JONATHAN SPICER  ISTANBUL/ANKARA, SEPT 20 (REUTERS) - TURKEY FORCED BANKS TO TAKE LOSSES ON $8 BILLION IN BAD LOANS THIS WEEK TO KICK-START LENDING AND BOOST ITS ECONOMIC RECOVERY AFTER LOSING PATIENCE WITH THEM, BANKERS, SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND INDUSTRY ADVISERS TOLD REUTERS.  ANKARA\u2019S MOST AGGRESSIVE MOVE YET TO CURE A HANGOVER FROM TURKEY\u2019S 2018 CURRENCY CRISIS HAS LEFT BANKS SCRAMBLING TO MEET A YEAR-END DEADLINE TO RESTRUCTURE LOANS OR READY THEM FOR SALE.  TURKEY'S BANK WATCHDOG HAD BEEN CALLING BANK EXECUTIVES IN RECENT WEEKS, AFTER THREE MONTHS OF TALKS FAILED TO DELIVER ACTION, TO TELL THEM WHAT PORTION OF LOANS THEY SHOULD RECLASSIFY AS NON-PERFORMING TMSNRT.RS/2OA8LLL AND TO MAKE PROVISIONS, TWO SOURCES SAID.  ON TUESDAY, A YEAR ON FROM THE DARKEST MOMENTS OF THE CURRENCY CRISIS, THE BDDK WATCHDOG WENT PUBLIC WITH ITS REQUIREMENT FOR BANKS TO WRITE OFF LOANS TOTALLING 46 BILLION LIRA ($8.1 BILLION) AS NON-PERFORMING LOANS (NPLS).  THE MOVE WAS DRIVEN BY THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S DESIRE FOR BANKS, ESPECIALLY MORE CAUTIOUS PRIVATE ONES, TO EXTEND MORE CREDIT AND HELP MEET PRESIDENT TAYYIP ERDOGAN\u2019S GOAL OF 5% ECONOMIC GROWTH NEXT YEAR, FIVE SOURCES SAID.  \u201cTHE GOVERNMENT HAS LOST PATIENCE AND WANTS ACTION. WE KNEW THAT NOTHING WAS HAPPENING IN AUGUST, SO IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF WHO WAS GOING TO LOSE PATIENCE FIRST,\u201d ONE OF THE SOURCES, A SENIOR BANKER INVOLVED IN TALKS WITH THE BDDK AND GOVERNMENT, TOLD REUTERS.  THE BANKS HAD HOPED TURKEY\u2019S TREASURY MINISTRY WOULD DO MORE TO SHIELD THEM FROM LOSSES, TELLING THE BDDK AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS THAT FISCAL POLICIES HAD IN PART LED TO THE DOWNTURN, A SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL AND THE SENIOR BANKER SAID.  THE BDDK REFERRED REUTERS TO ITS STATEMENT ON TUESDAY, WHILE THE TREASURY DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE BDDK MOVE.  AMONG THE BIG PRIVATE BANKS LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY THE CHANGE, ANALYSTS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED YAPI KREDI AND GARANTI BBVA, WHOSE SHARES BOTH SLIPPED THIS WEEK.  NEITHER BANK WAS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE TO COMMENT ON NPLS.  THE 2018 CRISIS SLICED 30% OFF THE VALUE OF THE TURKISH LIRA, ENDED YEARS OF A CONSTRUCTION-DRIVEN BOOM FUELLED BY CHEAP FOREIGN CREDIT, AND SENT INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES SOARING.  TURKEY\u2019S $766 BILLION ECONOMY SLIPPED INTO A RECESSION THAT HAS STRETCHED INTO 2019, LEAVING BANKS WITH SOME $20 BILLION OF DEBT THAT CONSTRUCTION AND ENERGY FIRMS CAN NO LONGER SERVICE.  DURING WEEKS OF CALLS WITH THE REGULATOR, THE BANKS SOUGHT BROADER \u201cSTRUCTURAL CHANGES\u201d AND PROPOSED MERGING OR CANCELLING PROJECTS UNDERPINNING SOME OF THE LOANS, THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID.  THE SENIOR BANKER SAID LENDERS WARNED AGAINST FORCING THEM TO RECOGNISE LOSSES ON SUCH LARGE EXPOSURES BEFORE YEAR-END, PREFERRING INSTEAD TO SPREAD THEM OVER SEVERAL YEARS.  BUT THE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT CONVINCED.  \u201cTHE FOCUS FOR BOTH THE BDDK AND THE TREASURY IS FOR BANKS TO HAVE A TRANSPARENT, PLAIN BALANCE SHEET SO THEY CAN START LENDING AGAIN,\u201d A DEBT RESTRUCTURING CONSULTANT INVOLVED IN THE PRIVATE TALKS TOLD REUTERS ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY.  OUT OF TIME  ANKARA WAS IRRITATED THAT EFFORTS LED MOSTLY BY BANKS TO AGREE A FUND-OF-FUNDS TO MOP UP THE BAD DEBT HAD STALLED OVER THE SPRING AND SUMMER, REUTERS REPORTED IN JULY.  AND IT WAS NOT ENOUGH THAT THE BIGGEST BANKS HAD IN RECENT WEEKS ZEROED IN ON A NEW PLAN FOR AN ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY TO TAKE ON HIGHER-QUALITY NPLS, TWO SOURCES SAID.  SUCH A PLAN WOULD TAKE TIME AND THE BDDK WAS NOT ABOUT TO HOLD OFF ON ITS NPL ANNOUNCEMENT, THEY SAID.  IN GROUP AND BILATERAL TALKS BETWEEN THE BDDK AND BANKS THAT BEGAN IN JUNE, IT ASKED THEM \u201cONE LAST TIME\u201d TO RESTRUCTURE OR CONVERT THE MOSTLY STAGE 2 LOANS TO NPLS, THE SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID.  A STAGE 2 LOAN IS ONE WHERE THE RISK OF NONPAYMENT HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY.  \u201cBUT THE EXPECTED ACTION DID NOT MATERIALIZE, THUS THE (TUESDAY) STATEMENT,\u201d THE OFFICIAL ADDED. \u201cBANKS ARE BEING ASKED TO EXTEND MORE LOANS... AND OF COURSE TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE IN RESTRUCTURING OF PROBLEM LOANS.\u201d  THE TREASURY \u201cTHINKS IT IS THE BANKS\u2019 LACK OF APPETITE FOR LOANS THAT IS HOLDING BACK THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY,\u201d SAID A DEBT RESTRUCTURING CONSULTANT INVOLVED IN THE TALKS.  TURKEY\u2019S CENTRAL BANK, UNDER PRESSURE FROM ERDOGAN TO DO ITS BIT TO BOOST RECOVERY, HAS CUT INTEREST RATES BY 750 BASIS POINTS IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS AND MOVED TO RELIEVE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ON BANKS THAT RAMP UP LENDING.  \u201cTHE GOVERNMENT IS TAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS TO SUPPORT GROWTH, (AND) NEW STEPS AND ADJUSTMENTS WILL COME, BUT PRIVATE BANKS MUST REALLY GIVE STRONGER SUPPORT,\u201d A SECOND GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID.  CREDIT CONUNDRUM  ANALYSTS HAVE FLAGGED THE RISKS OF FORCING CREDIT EXPANSION ON AN ECONOMY THAT WAS STILL CONTRACTING YEAR-ON-YEAR IN THE SECOND QUARTER, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE FEW IF ANY STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO RELY LESS ON FOREIGN FUNDING.  \u201cTHE MOVE HIGHLIGHTS, ONCE AGAIN, THAT CREDIT GROWTH RATHER THAN A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE OF STRUCTURAL REFORMS REMAINS THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PREFERRED APPROACH TO SUPPORT TURKEY\u2019S AILING ECONOMY,\u201d SAID WOLFANGO PICCOLI, CO-PRESIDENT OF TENEO, A RISK CONSULTANCY.  THE FIRST GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SAID ONE MOTIVATION FOR THE BDDK MOVE WAS THAT INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND OFFICIALS VISITED TURKEY THIS MONTH TO PREPARE AN ANNUAL REPORT, WHICH WILL NOW INCLUDE THE 46 BILLION-LIRA FIGURE. LAST YEAR, THE IMF REQUESTED MORE PRECISE DATA ON NPLS, THE OFFICIAL SAID.  OTHERS PRAISED THE BDDK FOR SHINING A LIGHT ON THE SIZE OF TURKEY\u2019S BAD DEBT PROBLEM, AND ESTIMATED IT WOULD TRIM BANKS\u2019 EARNINGS BY ABOUT 20% THIS YEAR. THE BDDK SAID BANKS\u2019 NPL RATIO WOULD RISE TO 6.3% BY YEAR END, FROM 4.6%.  AND WHILE TURKISH BANKS HAVE RESISTED OVERTURES ALL YEAR FROM POTENTIAL NPL BUYERS, THAT MAY CHANGE. \u201cBANKS CAN NOW AT LEAST SAY HOW MANY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR THEY ARE WILLING TO SELL FOR,\u201d SAID A SECOND SENIOR BANKER.  BUT THE CONSULTANT SAID BANKS WERE MORE LIKELY TO ACCELERATE RESTRUCTURING SO THEY \u201cCAN GET AWAY WITH SETTING ASIDE LESS PROVISIONS FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES.\u201d  WHILE AN INDEX OF TURKISH BANKS HAS FALLEN 2.3% SINCE THE BDDK\u2019S ANNOUNCEMENT, STATE BANKS, WHICH SHOULDERED A BUMP IN LENDING IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, MAY SEE SOME BENEFITS.

COMCAST MAY BE DRAWING A LINE IN THE SAND AND WANTS TO AVOID LETTING GOOGLE DO TO THE VIDEO AD BUSINESS WHAT IT HAS DONE TO THE ONLINE AD MARKET.  IT IS THE FIRST TIME ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH ITS OWN MUSCULAR LOBBYING APPARATUS IN WASHINGTON, IS TAKING SIDES IN THE ANTITRUST BATTLE LOOMING OVER THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST SELLER OF ONLINE ADS.

THE ISSUES RAISED BY COMCAST AND ITS SUBSIDIARY HAVE BEEN ECHOED WIDELY IN THE CABLE AND AD TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES. MOST COMPANIES THAT CONTEND GOOGLE HAS UNFAIRLY SQUEEZED THEM OUT HAVE BEEN RETICENT TO SPEAK OUT BECAUSE THEY RELY ON GOOGLE SERVICES AND FEAR RETALIATION.  BUT COMCAST, WHICH OWNS MEDIA COMPANY NBC, UNIVERSAL PICTURES AND THE XFINITY INTERNET SERVICE, IS A LARGE SPENDER ON STATE AND FEDERAL LOBBYING AND ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND A VETERAN OF POLITICAL ORGANIZING.  THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND A COALITION OF 50 STATE-LEVEL ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE EACH ASKED GOOGLE FOR INFORMATION ABOUT ITS ADS BUSINESS IN RECENT WEEKS AS THEY BEGIN INVESTIGATING POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF ANTITRUST LAW.  GOOGLE DECLINED TO COMMENT ON COMCAST\u2019S RECENT ACTIONS BUT HAS SAID IT IS COOPERATING WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS AND THAT IT FACES ROBUST COMPETITION IN ADVERTISING, INCLUDING FROM COMCAST.  PRIVACY PUSH  FREEWHEEL\u2019S TENSIONS WITH GOOGLE STEM FROM A ONE-OF-A-KIND AGREEMENT STRUCK IN 2009 AS YOUTUBE SOUGHT TO BURNISH ITS IMAGE WITH CLIPS FROM WELL-KNOWN TV CHANNELS.  THE DEAL ENABLES MEDIA COMPANIES SUCH AS NBC, TURNER, NOW OWNED BY AT&T INC, AND VIACOM INC TO SELL ADS ALONGSIDE THEIR CONTENT ON YOUTUBE USING FREEWHEEL\u2019S TECHNOLOGY RATHER THAN GOOGLE\u2019S COMPETING TOOL, ENSURING ACCESS TO THEIR SINGLE, PREFERRED SYSTEM ACROSS VARIOUS STREAMING WEBSITES AND APPS.  FREEWHEEL IS THE GO-TO VIDEO AD SERVER BECAUSE OF ITS EXPERIENCE, SAID A FREEWHEEL CLIENT, SPEAKING ON THE CONDITION OF ANONYMITY.  BUT LAST YEAR, GOOGLE CLOSED FREEWHEEL\u2019S PIPE INTO YOUTUBE IN EUROPE, CITING THE EU\u2019S GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION THAT IMPOSED NEW REQUIREMENTS ON COMPANIES SEEKING TO SHARE CONSUMER DATA.  IN THE UNITED STATES, GOOGLE HAS ALLOWED FREEWHEEL\u2019S CONTINUED USE ON THE CONDITION THAT STARTING WITH TESTS THIS MONTH, THE TENS OF MEDIA COMPANIES RELIANT ON IT WILL BE CUT OFF FROM ACCESSING SOME USER DATA FOR PRIVACY REASONS, ONE OF THE SOURCES SAID. THE DATA REDUCTION COULD MAKE FREEWHEEL\u2019S SYSTEM LESS ATTRACTIVE TO MEDIA COMPANIES AND THEIR ADVERTISERS, POTENTIALLY PROMPTING A SHIFT TO GOOGLE, THE SOURCE SAID.  GOOGLE SAID A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF YOUTUBE REVENUE IS AFFECTED AND THAT IT HAS BEEN WORKING WITH FREEWHEEL TO RESTORE ACCESS IN EUROPE AND PRESERVE IT IN THE UNITED STATES.  A FREEWHEEL REPRESENTATIVE BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE AT A PRIVATE HEARING IN SEPTEMBER OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE\u2019S TECH TASK FORCE, LED BY REPUBLICAN SENATOR MARSHA BLACKBURN, THE SOURCES BRIEFED ON THE DISCUSSION SAID.  BLACKBURN, WHO IS HOLDING HEARINGS TO INFORM POTENTIAL PRIVACY LAWS, SAID ON C-SPAN LAST WEEK THAT A CONGRESSIONAL PRIVACY BILL BEING WEIGHED MUST PRESERVE COMPETITION BETTER THAN EU REGULATIONS HAVE. HER SPOKESWOMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT ON FREEWHEEL\u2019S TASK FORCE COMMENTS.  INTERNET TRACKING  THE CONFLICT IS PLAYING OUT ON ANOTHER FRONT. GOOGLE SAID LAST MONTH IT IS EXPERIMENTING WITH ENCRYPTING THE INTERNET TRAFFIC OF CHROME USERS, AND ANDROID HAS SIMILAR CAPABILITY IN ITS NEWEST VERSION.  THE MOVE, TECHNICALLY KNOWN AS DNS-OVER-HTTPS, INCREASES USERS\u2019 PRIVACY AND SECURITY BY LIMITING SOME COMPANIES, INCLUDING INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, FROM TRACKING USERS\u2019 BROWSING.

FILE PHOTO: PHARMACEUTICAL TABLETS AND CAPSULES ARE ARRANGED IN THE SHAPE OF A U.S. DOLLAR SIGN ON A TABLE IN THIS PICTURE ILLUSTRATION TAKEN IN LJUBLJANA AUGUST 20, 2014. REUTERS/SRDJAN ZIVULOVIC  THE COMPANY HAS HELD BACK ON MARKETING THE PHARMACY BENEFIT PLAN WHILE IT TALKS TO THESE GROUPS, CVS SAID.  THE PLAN, LAUNCHED A YEAR AGO, IS BASED ON ANALYSES BY THE INSTITUTE FOR CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC REVIEW (ICER), A BOSTON-BASED GROUP THAT ASSESSES EFFECTIVENESS OF DRUGS TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE PRICES.  USING ICER\u2019S COST EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT, CVS DECIDES WHETHER TO INCLUDE SECOND OR THIRD MEDICINES ENTERING THE MARKET IF THERE ARE ALREADY SIMILAR ONES IN THE PLAN.  OPPOSITION TO THE CVS PLAN IS PART OF MUCH BROADER CONCERNS CITED BY DRUG COMPANIES AND ADVOCACY GROUPS, MANY OF WHICH RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. SOME SAY THAT ICER\u2019S ANALYSIS BASED ON ADDITIONAL YEARS OF \u201cQUALITY LIFE\u201d GAINED FROM A GIVEN TREATMENT IS ARBITRARY AND DISREGARDS THE COSTS OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND PATIENT NEEDS.  MORE THAN 50 GROUPS, INCLUDING DRUGMAKERS, PHRMA, THE INDUSTRY\u2019S MAIN LOBBY GROUP, AND OTHER ADVOCACY GROUPS, HAVE PROVIDED COMMENT DURING A PUBLIC INPUT PERIOD INCLUDED IN A REVIEW BY ICER OF ITS ASSESSMENT METHODS. MANY ASKED ICER TO ELIMINATE PRICE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM ITS EFFICACY ANALYSES.  ICER HAS DEFENDED ITS METHODS, WHICH ARE BASED ON A WIDELY-USED COST EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS.  THE SOFT ROLLOUT OF CVS\u2019 ICER-RELATED PRODUCT COMES AS EMPLOYER HEALTH PLAN SPONSORS - ITS BIGGEST CLIENTS - ARE SHOWING INCREASED CONCERN OVER THEIR COST FOR NEW HIGH-PRICED DRUGS, AND ARE CONSIDERING REFUSING TO PAY FOR THEM AT ALL, CVS CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER TROY BRENNAN SAID IN A RECENT INTERVIEW.  IF CORPORATE CUSTOMERS FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT THREAT, CVS SAID IT COULD CHANGE TACTICS WITH THE PLAN.  RISING DRUG PRICES, PARTICULARLY FOR EXPENSIVE SPECIALTY TREATMENTS FOR SEVERE OR DEADLY CONDITIONS, HAVE PUSHED ANNUAL U.S. HEALTHCARE SPENDING TO $3.65 TRILLION, AND MADE THEM UNAFFORDABLE FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS.  EARLIER THIS YEAR, NOVARTIS AG (NOVN.S) LAUNCHED ZOLGENSMA, A MORE THAN $2 MILLION GENE THERAPY FOR A RARE BUT DEADLY DISEASE CALLED SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY.  THE NEW CVS PROGRAM, CITED AS AN EXAMPLE OF ICER\u2019S GROWING INFLUENCE ON U.S. DRUG PRICING, WOULD NOT APPLY TO SUCH A BREAKTHROUGH TREATMENT. IT IS A TINY PLAN BY CVS STANDARDS AS THE COMPANY MANAGES PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS FOR MORE THAN 102 MILLION PEOPLE AND ALSO OWNS AETNA INSURANCE AND A NATIONAL PHARMACY CHAIN.  NOT WIDELY PROMOTED  THE PLAN\u2019S SCOPE IS LIMITED TO SO-CALLED ME TOO DRUGS, THOSE WHERE SIMILAR EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS ALREADY EXIST, AND AIMS TO PRESSURE DRUGMAKERS TO SET LOWER PRICES. FOR EXAMPLE, TWO OF THREE VERY SIMILAR DRUGS FOR MIGRAINE APPROVED IN 2018 COULD HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED, BUT DRUGMAKERS SET PRICES ICER DEEMED COST EFFECTIVE.  CVS HAS LIMITED SALES AND MARKETING FOR THE PLAN WHILE IT TALKS TO PATIENT GROUPS WHO OPPOSE IT. ABOUT 240,000 CVS EMPLOYEES AND A FEW LARGE CLIENTS\u2019 EMPLOYEES ARE ENROLLED THUS FAR. THE COMPANY DECLINED TO COMMENT ON EXACT MEMBERSHIP.  \u201cWE ARE NOT WIDELY PROMOTING THIS PROGRAM,\u201d BRENNAN SAID, ADDING THAT CVS IS WORKING TO ADDRESS PATIENT GROUPS\u2019 CONCERNS.  MEANWHILE, BRENNAN SAID SOME EMPLOYERS ARE CONSIDERING REFUSING TO PAY FOR MILLION-DOLLAR TREATMENTS LIKE GENE THERAPY. THEY ARE SAYING, \u201cI\u2019M NOT GOING TO COVER THESE KINDS OF THERAPIES NO MATTER WHAT THEIR COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS IS IF THEY\u2019VE GOT A REALLY HIGH COST.\u201d  LARGE HEALTHCARE CONSULTANT AND BROKERAGE MERCER SAID IT HAS BEGUN TO FIELD SIMILAR CONCERNS.  \u201cWE HAVE CERTAINLY GOTTEN SOME PLAN SPONSORS SAYING \u2018WHAT IF WE DON\u2019T COVER SPECIALTY DRUGS?\u2019\u201d SAID DAVID DROSS, WHO RUNS MERCER\u2019S MANAGED PHARMACY PRACTICE. TWO YEARS AGO, IT NEVER RECEIVED ANY SUCH QUESTIONS, HE SAID.  STEVE WOJCIK, AN EXECUTIVE WITH THE NATIONAL BUSINESS GROUP ON HEALTH WHICH REPRESENTS LARGE EMPLOYERS, SAID HE DOES NOT BELIEVE MANY WILL TAKE THAT DRASTIC STEP.  STILL, ICER PRESIDENT STEVEN PEARSON SAID EMPLOYERS TELL HIM THEY WORRY ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO COVER EVERYTHING AND HAVE SUGGESTED THEY MIGHT DROP SOME HIGH-COST TREATMENTS. HE SAID EMPLOYERS CAN USE COST EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS TO HELP THEM MANAGE THEIR SPENDING.  FILE PHOTO: THE CVS LOGO IS SEEN AT ONE OF THEIR STORES IN MANHATTAN, NEW YORK, U.S., AUGUST 1, 2016. REUTERS/ANDREW KELLY  ICER HAS RESPONDED TO OUTSIDE CRITICISM BY MEETING WITH PATIENT ADVOCATES AND BY ADDING NEW MEASUREMENTS FOR A DRUG\u2019S EFFECTIVENESS, SUCH AS THE VALUE OF LIFE YEARS GAINED, WHICH DOES NOT FOCUS ON QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS, PEARSON SAID.  SINCE 2015, ICER HAS PUBLISHED UP TO A DOZEN REVIEWS EACH YEAR OF DRUGS AND CLASSES OF MEDICINES.  MOST U.S. PRIVATE INSURERS NOW USE ICER CLINICAL AND COST ANALYSES TO INFORM COVERAGE NEGOTIATIONS WITH DRUGMAKERS.

ONE BIG REASON: THEY DO NOT WANT TO ATTRACT CRIMINALS.  \u201cYOU ARE GETTING YOURSELF IN A POSITION WHERE YOU COULD BE SUBJECT TO RANSOM,\u201d ENTREPRENEUR ULISES VAZQUEZ SAID OF THE DRUG-FUELED VIOLENCE AND KIDNAPPINGS THAT HAVE SCARRED SOCIETY.  \u201cYOU WANT TO HAVE A LOW PROFILE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE WITH YOUR FREEDOM,\u201d HE ADDED. VAZQUEZ TWICE KEPT QUIET ON MAJOR STARTUP MILESTONES: WHEN HE SOLD A STAKE IN HIS ADVERTISING AGENCY ERGOS IN 2010, AND WHEN THE ACQUIRING FIRM, MATOMY , WENT PUBLIC IN 2014.  THOUGH UNDERSTANDABLE, THE LOW-PROFILE APPROACH IS HOLDING BACK MEXICO\u2019S TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY, INVESTORS AND EXPERTS SAY, MAKING IT HARDER TO ATTRACT TALENT AND MONEY, ESPECIALLY FROM ABROAD.  MEXICO\u2019S TECH SECTOR LAST YEAR DREW ONLY $175 MILLION IN VENTURE CAPITAL, ACCORDING TO THE ASSOCIATION FOR PRIVATE CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN LATIN AMERICA. THAT WAS DWARFED BY BRAZIL, THE REGION\u2019S POWERHOUSE, WHICH RECEIVED $1.3 BILLION, BUT ALSO TRAILED COLOMBIA, WHICH DREW $334 MILLION IN VENTURE CAPITAL THOUGH ITS ECONOMY IS WORTH ABOUT A QUARTER OF MEXICO\u2019S.  REUTERS SPOKE WITH TWO DOZEN INVESTORS AND STARTUP FOUNDERS WHO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SECURITY CONCERNS WERE WIDESPREAD IN THE TECH COMMUNITY AND HAD EVEN PUSHED SOME ENTREPRENEURS ABROAD.  ILLUSTRATING THE CONCERN, MOST DECLINED TO SPEAK ON THE RECORD.  WITHOUT PUBLICITY, ENTREPRENEURS STRUGGLE TO RECRUIT THE BEST, BRING IN MONEY AND INSPIRE THE NEXT GENERATION, SAID DANIEL GREEN, A PARTNER AT SILICON VALLEY LAW FIRM GUNDERSON DETTMER WHO ADVISES STARTUPS ACROSS LATIN AMERICA.  \u201cIT CERTAINLY STUNTS THE GROWTH,\u201d HE SAID.  \u201cLIVING AT RISK\u201d  TO BE SURE, VIOLENCE IS RAMPANT ELSEWHERE IN LATIN AMERICA, FROM DRUG-TORN COLOMBIA TO CRIME-RIDDEN BRAZIL.  BUT THE ISSUE IS ESPECIALLY ACUTE IN MEXICO DUE TO AN ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE FROM OVER A DECADE AGO WHEN THE GOVERNMENT SENT ARMED FORCES INTO THE STREETS TO CRACK DOWN ON THE CARTELS. AROUND THE SAME TIME, DRUG GANGS BEGAN BRANCHING INTO EXTORTION.  A STRING OF HIGH-PROFILE KIDNAPPINGS AND MURDERS, INCLUDING THE DEATH OF AN EXECUTIVE AT BROADCASTER TELEVISA KILLED ON HIS BIKE DURING A SHOOTOUT IN 2017, RATTLED THE ELITE.  THAT HAS GENERATED BUSINESS FOR EXECUTIVE PROTECTION FIRMS, WHO PROVIDE BULLET-PROOF VEHICLES, GPS TRACKERS, ARMED BODYGUARDS AND REAL-TIME MONITORING.  FOR STARTUPS, THE FEARS MAY BE MORE PERCEPTION THAN REALITY: THERE ARE NO KNOWN CASES OF TECH ENTREPRENEURS BEING ATTACKED AFTER SHARING THEIR COMPANY\u2019S SUCCESS.  AND SOME DO STILL ANNOUNCE THEIR DEALS.  BISMARCK LEPE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF SOFTWARE COMPANY WIZELINE, BELIEVES HIS PEERS ARE BEING OVER-CAUTIOUS, DESPITE THE HORRORS MEXICO HAS SUFFERED.  \u201cCOMMUNICATING MORE ABOUT YOUR SUCCESS HELPS THE COMMUNITY, HELPS THE COMPANY, HELPS THE INVESTORS,\u201d SAID LEPE, WHO DIVIDES HIS TIME BETWEEN SILICON VALLEY AND MEXICO.  \u201cAS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE DRUG TRADE, NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU.\u201d  MEXICAN ENTREPRENEUR DOMINGO GUERRA, WHO FOUNDED CYBERSECURITY STARTUP APPTHORITY IN CALIFORNIA, SAID HE IS NOT GENERALLY WORRIED ABOUT SAFETY WHEN HE RETURNS HOME. BUT HE DID FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AFTER ANNOUNCING A FUNDING ROUND.  \u201cFOLKS WERE ASKING HOW I WAS GOING TO SPEND THE MONEY, WHAT I WAS GOING TO BUY FIRST,\u201d SAID GUERRA, NOW A SENIOR DIRECTOR AT CYBERSECURITY GIANT SYMANTEC AFTER THE ACQUISITION OF HIS COMPANY IN 2018. \u201cI SPENT A LOT OF TIME EXPLAINING THAT REALLY NONE OF THAT MONEY WAS FOR THE FOUNDERS.\u201d  ONE STARTUP FOUNDER, ASSIGNED A U.S. ARMY VETERAN TRAINED IN ANTI-KIDNAPPING MANEUVERS BY A FIRM ACQUIRING HIS COMPANY, BECAME FED UP OF HAVING TO TAKE A DIFFERENT ROUTE HOME EVERY DAY AND EVENTUALLY RELOCATED WITH HIS FAMILY TO THE UNITED STATES.  ANOTHER WHO FOUNDED HIS STARTUP IN THE SAN FRANCISCO AREA SAID AMERICAN COLLEAGUES WERE FRUSTRATED BY HIS QUIET APPROACH DUE TO FEARS FOR HIS RELATIVES BACK IN MEXICO.  \u201cTHERE\u2019S AN UNOFFICIAL TAX FOR OPERATING AND LIVING IN MEXICO - AND THAT TAX IS LIVING AT RISK,\u201d HE SAID.  FROM SCOOTER TO SUV  SOME ENTREPRENEURS HAVE SIMPLY FADED FROM PUBLIC VIEW.  ADOLFO BABATZ, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF MEXICAN PAYMENTS COMPANY CLIP, WAS ONCE A STAPLE OF THE LOCAL BUSINESS PRESS. IN 2018, HE GAVE AT LEAST FIVE PUBLISHED INTERVIEWS AND GRACED THE COVER OF BUSINESS MAGAZINE EXPANSION BESIDE THE HEADLINE: \u201cTHINK BIG.\u201d  HE TOOK A DIFFERENT TACK THIS YEAR AFTER SOFTBANK PUMPED ABOUT $20 MILLION INTO HIS COMPANY, MAKING HIM AMONG THE FIRST MEXICAN ENTREPRENEURS TO WIN THE JAPANESE CONGLOMERATE\u2019S STAMP OF APPROVAL. BABATZ DID NOT ANNOUNCE THE DEAL AND APPEARS TO HAVE GIVEN FEW INTERVIEWS SO FAR IN 2019.  SOFTBANK, WHICH PLANS TO POUR $5 BILLION INTO LATIN AMERICA, DECLINED TO COMMENT.  SOME ENTREPRENEURS ADVOCATE WORKAROUNDS.  GABRIEL LEON, WHO RECENTLY LAUNCHED FINTECH COMPANY OYSTER FINANCIAL IN MEXICO, PLANS TO DISCLOSE COMPANY FUNDING ROUNDS ON AN ONLINE DATABASE, RATHER THAN VIA THE MEDIA.  \u201cWE NEVER TALK ABOUT MONEY,\u201d HE SAID. \u201cWE TALK ABOUT THE PRODUCT WE\u2019RE BUILDING, THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE MARKET, OUR COMPETITORS. THAT\u2019S HOW YOU GET ATTENTION FROM INVESTORS.\u201d  SOME ENTREPRENEURS SAY THE POLITICAL CLIMATE, WITH LEFTIST PRESIDENT ANDRES MANUEL LOPEZ OBRADOR FREQUENTLY CRUSADING AGAINST THE ELITES, HAS MADE IT AN ADDITIONALLY AWKWARD TIME TO TOUT MULTI-MILLION DEALS IN A CULTURE THAT FROWNS ON BRAGGING.  MEXICO\u2019S ECONOMY MINISTRY DID NOT RESPOND TO REUTERS REQUESTS TO DISCUSS THE STARTUP SECTOR\u2019S SECURITY CONCERNS.  SERGIO ROMO, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF MEXICAN SCOOTER STARTUP GRIN, FOLLOWED A SIMILAR TRAJECTORY TO BABATZ AFTER A $45.7 MILLION FUNDING ROUND LAST YEAR.  EARLIER THIS YEAR, ROMO, WHO WAS KNOWN FOR TOOLING AROUND THE CAPITAL IN HIS COMPANY\u2019S NEON GREEN SCOOTERS, LEFT A MEETING WITH MEXICO CITY REGULATORS IN A LARGE SUV WITH TINTED WINDOWS, ACCORDING TO SOMEONE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE MEETING.  ROMO TOLD REUTERS THAT WAS UNUSUAL AND HE STILL USES SCOOTERS, BUT ACKNOWLEDGED KEEPING A LOW PROFILE WAS ADVISABLE.  \u201cPEOPLE OUTSIDE THE STARTUP WORLD TEND TO THINK THAT FOUNDERS WHO RAISE A LOT OF MONEY BECOME RICH THEMSELVES, BUT SOMETIMES THAT\u2019S NOT THE CASE,\u201d HE SAID.  \u201cWE ARE JUST FOUNDERS TRYING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.\u201d  ONCE ACTIVE ON TWITTER, HIS POSTS HAVE BEEN DELETED.", "Ticker": "NSIT", "Date": "2019-10-16T00:00:00", "key": "20191016NSIT", "labelr0": 1.5881418740074087, "labelr1": 0.7121764808059694, "labelr2": 0.7416350465677816, "labelr3": 0.2910460537579211, "labelr4": -0.768180266302485, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.314, "compound": -0.4939, "0_day_return": 1.5881418740073985, "1_day_return": 1.5881418740073985, "2_day_return": 1.459093277748824, "3_day_return": 1.754385964912264, "4_day_return": 0.9727288518325494, "label": 1, "return": 0.0027628316524479237, "excess_return": 1.5853790423549503, "count_of_word": 1065, "pred": -1, "prof-1": 0.42982563, "prof1": 0.57017446, "fst_sentencepc_pred": 1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5998460468162881, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4001539531837121, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.42982563, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.57017446, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.39928806, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.60071194, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5124727, "tr_prof1": 0.48752725, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.433254, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.56674606, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5745474, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.42545256, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.5370047, "headline_prof21": 0.4629953, "textplusheadline_pred": -1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.54584885, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.4541512, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.7651541999999999, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.23484579, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.8040719, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.19592808, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -1.5881418740073985, "returnpredvader": -1.5881418740073985, "returnpredsgd": -1.5881418740073985, "returnfst_spacy_pred": 1.5881418740073985, "returnfst_sentencepc_pred2": -1.5881418740073985, "returnheadline_pred": -1.5881418740073985, "returntextplusheadline_pred": -1.5881418740073985, "returntr_headlineplustext_pred": -1.5881418740073985, "returntr_headline_pred": -1.5881418740073985, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9999631231522269, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9992690881236788, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.9957475576736204, "dailyaveragereturnfst_spacy_pred": 1.0021433037806535, "dailyaveragereturnfst_sentencepc_pred2": 0.0, "dailyaveragereturnreturnfst_sentencepc_pred2": 0.9980695554466495, "dailyaveragereturnreturnheadline_pred": 0.9961069389269032, "dailyaveragereturnreturntextplusheadline_pred": 0.9919652688874186, "dailyaveragereturnreturntr_headlineplustext_pred": 1.0035987642325623, "dailyaveragereturnreturntr_headline_pred": 0.9977036626439523, "cumreturn1b": 2.569461590677221, "cumreturn1d": 1.2525479404174291, "cumreturn1e": 1.3916612460038418, "cumreturn1f": 0.9116310768395389, "cumreturn1g": 0.0, "cumreturn1h": 0.8757747713280831, "cumreturn1i": 1.0776930016039963, "cumreturn1j": 2.2145132714430975, "cumreturn1k": 1.78497296298325, "cumreturndow": 1.1943880815618717, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1576117005615842}, {"Unnamed: 0": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13205, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13205, "level_0": 13205, "index": 13205, "text": "SAO PAULO, OCT 16 (REUTERS) - BRAZILIAN STATE-RUN POWER FIRM CENTRAIS ELETRICAS BRASILEIRAS SA ESTIMATED THAT IT COULD RAISE UP TO 5.1 BILLION REAIS ($1.23 BILLION) VIA THE POTENTIAL ISSUE OF 9.99 BILLION REAIS WORTH OF SHARES, ACCORDING TO A COMPANY PRESENTATION RELEASED WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

REUTERS/MIKE BLAKE/FILE PHOTO  WHETHER BILLIONAIRE ELON MUSK\u2019S FLAGSHIP COMPANY CAN START MASS PRODUCTION QUICKLY ENOUGH TO HIT STATED TARGETS IS THE QUESTION INVESTORS WILL WANT AN ANSWER TO WHEN TESLA ANNOUNCES THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS ON WEDNESDAY.  THE U.S. ELECTRIC VEHICLES MAKER IS UNDER PRESSURE TO RAMP UP OUTPUT GLOBALLY, AND THE SHANGHAI PLANT\u2019S PRODUCTION SCHEDULE IS CRUCIAL IF IT WANTS TO REACH ITS AMBITIOUS TARGET OF AN ANNUALIZED PRODUCTION RATE OF 500,000 VEHICLES BY THE END OF THE YEAR.  TESLA LAST WEEK OBTAINED THE CERTIFICATE IT NEEDS TO START MANUFACTURING CARS IN THE COUNTRY. BUT ANALYSTS CONTEND THAT UNCERTAINTIES AROUND LABOR AND SUPPLIERS MAKE IT A CHALLENGE TO START MASS PRODUCTION.  \u201cTHERE IS A LOT IN THE EQUATION THAT IS NOT IN THEIR CONTROL,\u201d SAID TU LE, ANALYST AT CHINA-BASED RESEARCH FIRM SINO AUTO INSIGHTS.  \u201cTHERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT JUST NEED TIME IN ORDER TO COMPLETE, LIKE QUALIFYING NEW MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, A NEW BATTERY SUPPLIER, GETTING THE TOOLING SHIPPED AND SET UP, AS WELL AS SETTING UP ALL THE SUPPLIERS. ANY PARTS THAT HAVE TO BE IMPORTED NEED TO GO THROUGH CUSTOMS, WHICH ALSO COULD MEAN DELAYS,\u201d HE SAID.  TESLA IS ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING A KEY CERTIFICATION NEEDED TO SELL CHINA-MADE CARS IN THE COUNTRY, IT TOLD LOCAL MEDIA, THOUGH IT IS UNCLEAR WHEN THE GOVERNMENT WILL GRANT IT SALES CLEARANCE.  TESLA DID NOT REPLY TO AN EMAIL SEEKING COMMENT.  IT SAID IN APRIL IT AIMS TO PRODUCE AT LEAST 1,000 MODEL 3 CARS A WEEK AT THE NEW FACTORY BY THE END OF THIS YEAR.  ANALYSTS, THOUGH, ARE DOUBTFUL THAT TESLA WILL HIT THIS TARGET, GIVEN ITS PATCHY PRODUCTION RECORD.  DELAYS AND QUALITY ISSUES HAVE MARRED THE LAUNCHES OF TESLA'S MODEL S AND MODEL X VEHICLES IN THE PAST, AND TESLA STRUGGLED TO START HERE MAKING THE MODEL 3 AT ITS CALIFORNIA FACTORY IN 2017.  THE COMPANY TOOK SIX MONTHS LONGER THAN ORIGINALLY FORECAST TO HIT A TARGET OF 5,000 MODEL 3 CARS PER WEEK, ACHIEVING THAT PACE ABOUT A YEAR AFTER LAUNCHING PRODUCTION.  STILL, TESLA IS TAKING STEPS TO ENSURE A SMOOTH LAUNCH OF PRODUCTION, INCLUDING TRYING TO DIVERSIFY ITS BATTERY SUPPLIER BASE, SOURCES HAVE SAID.  IT RECENTLY BOUGHT MAXWELL TECHNOLOGIES, WHOSE TECHNOLOGY COULD HELP THE CAR MAKER PRODUCE BATTERIES THAT LAST LONGER.  AT HIRING EVENTS IN SHANGHAI IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER, ATTENDED BY REUTERS JOURNALISTS, TESLA INTERVIEWED HUNDREDS OF CANDIDATES FROM MAINSTREAM CAR MAKERS IN CHINA.  IT ALSO ADVERTISED ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR BATTERY-RELATED PRODUCTION AND SOFTWARE SYSTEM ENGINEERS IN SHANGHAI, AND DELIVERY MANAGERS IN BIG CHINESE CITIES.  FURTHER LOSSES?  CHINA, FOR ITS PART, IS HELPING SPEED UP THINGS AT THE SHANGHAI FACTORY - THE COUNTRY\u2019S FIRST FULLY FOREIGN-OWNED CAR PLANT, A REFLECTION OF BEIJING\u2019S BROADER SHIFT TO OPEN UP ITS AUTO MARKET.  STATE-OWNED CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES HAVE ARRANGED EXTRA WORKFORCE AND BANKS ARE OFFERING CHEAP LOANS, WHILE THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT WILL EXEMPT TESLA CARS FROM ITS PURCHASE TAX, A CONCESSION MADE AMIDST TRADE TENSIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES.  THE MODEL 3 HAS FARED WELL IN CHINA, THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST CAR MARKET.  TESLA SALES IN CHINA LIKELY SURGED MORE THAN THREE FOLD TO 10,542 CARS IN THE QUARTER ENDED SEPT. 30, ACCORDING TO RESEARCH FIRM LMC AUTOMOTIVE.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO DELIVER 360,000 TO 400,000 CARS THIS YEAR GLOBALLY.  SLIDESHOW (4 IMAGES)  ANALYSTS EXPECT TESLA\u2019S THIRD-QUARTER REVENUE TO DECLINE 7% FROM THE YEAR-AGO QUARTER, ACCORDING TO REFINITIV DATA. THEY PREDICT A LOSS OF 42 CENTS PER SHARE, EXCLUDING ONE-TIME ITEMS, IN CONTRAST TO MUSK\u2019S PROMISES THAT THE COMPANY WOULD BREAK EVEN IN THE QUARTER.  GROSS MARGINS LIKELY SHRANK TO 15.6% FROM 22.3%.  \u201cTHE BIGGEST OVERHANG AROUND THE STORY IS THE ABILITY TO HIT PROFITABILITY AND TO ACHIEVE ITS AMBITIOUS UNIT GUIDANCE FOR 2019,\u201d WEDBUSH ANALYST DAN IVES SAID IN A PRE-EARNINGS RESEARCH NOTE.", "Ticker": "TSLA", "Date": "2019-10-23T00:00:00", "key": "20191023TSLA", "labelr0": -0.3521402300649525, "labelr1": 17.669231977383387, "labelr2": 9.493459690336355, "labelr3": -0.12799804955353547, "labelr4": -3.5061487290592144, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.0, "compound": 0.0, "0_day_return": -0.3521402300649568, "1_day_return": 17.669231977383394, "2_day_return": 28.84011308308465, "3_day_return": 28.675200251295728, "4_day_return": 24.16365635307054, "label": 1, "return": 0.0019204461816167387, "excess_return": 17.667311531201772, "count_of_word": 702, "pred": 1, "prof-1": 0.5477603, "prof1": 0.45223975, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5579773418349987, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4420226581650013, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.5477603, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.45223975, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": 1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.4519833, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.54801667, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5067604, "tr_prof1": 0.49323958, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.6485155, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.35148448, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5673609000000001, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.43263906, "headline_pred": -1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.5705985, "headline_prof21": 0.42940152, "textplusheadline_pred": 1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.44228733, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.5577127, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": -1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.53297585, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.4670242, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.6500613000000001, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.3499387, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": -17.669231977383394, "returnpredvader": -17.669231977383394, "returnpredsgd": -17.669231977383394, "returnfst_spacy_pred": 17.669231977383394, "returnfst_sentencepc_pred2": -17.669231977383394, "returnheadline_pred": -17.669231977383394, "returntextplusheadline_pred": 17.669231977383394, "returntr_headlineplustext_pred": -17.669231977383394, "returntr_headline_pred": -17.669231977383394, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0092915548681662, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9964599330020255, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 1.0032320654413662, "dailyaveragereturnfst_spacy_pred": 1.0039110188339415, "dailyaveragereturnfst_sentencepc_pred2": 0.0, "dailyaveragereturnreturnfst_sentencepc_pred2": 0.9989995212439232, "dailyaveragereturnreturnheadline_pred": 0.9971904208436501, "dailyaveragereturnreturntextplusheadline_pred": 0.9985412136910948, "dailyaveragereturnreturntr_headlineplustext_pred": 1.0059545626728874, "dailyaveragereturnreturntr_headline_pred": 1.0079749373335147, "cumreturn1b": 2.672886497839722, "cumreturn1d": 1.2603343928024717, "cumreturn1e": 1.4034561914507286, "cumreturn1f": 0.9203847696920603, "cumreturn1g": 0.0, "cumreturn1h": 0.8748589685574311, "cumreturn1i": 1.07130732634075, "cumreturn1j": 2.2996893978861417, "cumreturn1k": 1.826520596389416, "cumreturndow": 1.199304392465497, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1481732830780231}, {"Unnamed: 0": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13636, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 13636, "level_0": 13636, "index": 13636, "text": "OCT 24 (REUTERS) -

REUTERS/ARND WIEGMANN  NEW YORK (REUTERS BREAKINGVIEWS) - ALPHABET STILL RUNS FAST, BUT ITS PACE IS SLOWING. IT\u2019S A COMMON PROBLEM THAT COMES WITH AGING. A POTENTIAL BID FOR DEVICE-MAKER FITBIT COULD BRING NEW YOUTHFUL ENERGY FOR THE $880 BILLION FIRM, OR JUST A SLIGHTLY EXPANDED WAISTLINE.  THE OWNER OF GOOGLE SHOWED ON MONDAY THAT ITS CORE BUSINESS OF SELLING ONLINE ADS STILL PUMPS OUT PROFIT. ALPHABET\u2019S REVENUE HIT $40.5 BILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE YEAR, AN INCREASE OF 20% FROM LAST YEAR. BUT THAT\u2019S LESS RAPID THAN ITS RATE A YEAR AGO. INTERNET ADVERTISING IS MATURING AND RIVAL AMAZON IS PUSHING HARD \u2013 THAT BUSINESS IS THE MAIN COMPONENT OF A PART OF JEFF BEZOS\u2019 E-COMMERCE GIANT THAT GREW OVER 40%.  THE OFFER FOR FITBIT THAT REUTERS REPORTED, CITING SOURCES, HAS SOME LOGIC. ALPHABET CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE LARRY PAGE HAS MADE PUSHES IN MOBILE DEVICES, SMART CONTACTS AND DELIVERING BROADBAND VIA BALLOON AMONG OTHERS. ACQUISITIONS PLAYED A PART IN SEVERAL OF THESE EFFORTS. WHILE SOME PROVED WILDLY SUCCESSFUL \u2013 ITS MOBILE AD BUSINESS SUCCESS CAN BE PINNED IN LARGE PART TO BUYING THE MAKER OF THE ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM \u2013 OTHERS, SUCH AS FIBER BROADBAND, HAVE BEEN DUDS.  HEALTHCARE IS AN AREA WHERE GOOGLE HAS HAD LITTLE VISIBLE SUCCESS. PERHAPS FITBIT\u2019S EXPERIENCE IN DESIGNING WEARABLES WILL HELP ALPHABET MAKE USEFUL DEVICES FOR HEART-RATE MONITORING OR GLUCOSE MONITORS. ALPHABET COULD BRING HEFT THAT FITBIT ON ITS OWN LACKS. THE STOCK IS DOWN 70% FROM ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING IN 2015, PARTLY DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF APPLE\u2019S WATCH.  GROWING SIDEWAYS BRINGS PITFALLS. AS WELL AS BEING A DISTRACTION, AN ALPHABET BID FOR FITBIT COULD DRAW POLITICAL SCRUTINY. DATA COLLECTED BY HEALTH TRACKERS IS PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE IN THE EYES OF REGULATORS AND ANTITRUST WATCHDOGS HAVE SAID SUCH INFORMATION WOULD BECOME A MORE IMPORTANT PART OF MERGER REVIEWS. FITBIT IS ALSO A CONSUMER BRAND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE LIKELY TO UNDERSTAND, OR EVEN USE.  FITBIT IS TINY ENOUGH TO SWALLOW WHOLE \u2013 ITS MARKET CAPITALIZATION AT FRIDAY\u2019S CLOSE WAS JUST $1.1 BILLION \u2013 AND THE REVENUE POTENTIAL FROM DIVERSIFYING INTO HEALTHCARE AND MEDICAL TRACKING DEVICES IS LARGE. THAT, THOUGH, HAS TO BE WEIGHED AGAINST THE RISK OF REGULATORY FLACK, AND A SENSE THAT GOOGLE IS LOSING FOCUS.

QUESTION: WHY ARE THE TWO BROKERAGES THINKING OF MERGING?  THE DISCOUNT BROKERAGE BUSINESS MODEL IS FACING INCREASING PRESSURE, AS FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY DISRUPTORS LIKE ROBINHOOD PUSHED LEGACY FIRMS TO CUT COMMISSIONS TO ZERO, AND THE INCREASED USE OF TECHNOLOGY HAS REQUIRED HUGE SPENDING ON PLATFORMS. THE SOLUTION TO MANAGING COSTS IS GETTING BIGGER AND ACQUIRING MORE CLIENTS, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT SCHWAB COULD ACHIEVE BY ACQUIRING ITS SMALLER RIVAL.  QUESTION: WILL THIS AFFECT FEES FOR RETAIL INVESTORS?  CUSTOMERS OF BOTH FIRMS ALREADY GET FREE ONLINE TRADES OF STOCKS, ETFS AND OPTIONS. SCHWAB WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO CUT ITS FEES TO ZERO IN EARLY OCTOBER, FORCING TD AMERITRADE AND OTHERS TO FOLLOW WITH SIMILAR MOVES. ANALYSTS SAID IT IS UNLIKELY THE COMBINED FIRM WOULD RAISE FEES AFTER A MERGER.  QUESTION: HOW ELSE CAN THIS AFFECT RETAIL INVESTORS?  TD AMERITRADE CLIENTS COULD GAIN ACCESS TO SCHWAB\u2019S WEALTH MANAGEMENT, ASSET MANAGEMENT, BANKING AND CUSTODY SERVICES THROUGH THE DEAL, ACCORDING TO ANALYSTS.

JOHNSON/FILE PHOTO  BOEING CO\u2019S (BA.N) CST-100 STARLINER ASTRONAUT CAPSULE HAD A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH FOR ITS FIRST UNMANNED TEST MISSION, BUT WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS AN AUTOMATED TIMER ERROR PREVENTED THE SPACECRAFT FROM ATTAINING THE CORRECT ORBIT FOR IT TO RENDEZVOUS AND DOCK WITH THE SPACE STATION.  THE U.S. SPACE AGENCY IS FORMING AN INVESTIGATIVE TEAM TO DETERMINE WHAT CAUSED THE TIMER GLITCH AND \u201cANY OTHER SOFTWARE ISSUES,\u201d NASA SAID. THE TEAM WILL \u201cPROVIDE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS\u201d NEEDED BEFORE STARLINER CAN FLY A CREW OF ASTRONAUTS FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT ADDED, SAYING THE PROBE WILL TAKE ABOUT TWO MONTHS.  NASA SAID IT WAS WEIGHING WHETHER TO MAKE BOEING REPEAT THE TEST, WHICH WOULD LIKELY COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND ADD FURTHER DELAY, TO SHOW IT CAN DOCK AT THE STATION SUCCESSFULLY. DOCKING WAS A KEY REQUIREMENT FOR THE TEST UNDER BOEING\u2019S CONTRACT.  \u201cALTHOUGH DATA FROM THE UNCREWED TEST IS IMPORTANT FOR CERTIFICATION, IT MAY NOT BE THE ONLY WAY THAT BOEING IS ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE ITS SYSTEM\u2019S FULL CAPABILITIES,\u201d THE AGENCY SAID.  IT ADDED THAT IT WOULD TAKE NASA \u201cSEVERAL WEEKS\u201d TO DECIDE WHETHER BOEING WILL NEED TO RE-DO ITS TEST OR CARRY ON TO THE FINAL TEST FLIGHT OF LOFTING HUMANS TO THE SPACE STATION, SET FOR LATER THIS YEAR.  THE SPACECRAFT, A CONE-SHAPED POD WITH SEATS FOR SEVEN ASTRONAUTS, LANDED SUCCESSFULLY IN WHITE SANDS, NEW MEXICO SIX DAYS EARLIER THAN PLANNED, AFTER ITS DECEMBER LAUNCH.  THE LANDING, WHICH TESTED THE CAPSULE\u2019S DIFFICULT RE-ENTRY INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND PARACHUTE DEPLOYMENT, YIELDED THE MISSION\u2019S MOST VALUABLE TEST DATA, NASA ADMINISTRATOR JIM BRIDENSTINE SAID.

THE DECLINES WERE MORE PRONOUNCED ON BOTH THE CME AND SHANGHAI FUTURES EXCHANGES (SHFE) CONTRACTS WITH VOLUMES SLUMPING BY 25% AND 29% RESPECTIVELY.  ONLY NICKEL BUCKED THE BROADER TREND THANKS TO HEIGHTENED PRICE VOLATILITY AND THE METAL\u2019S ELECTRIC VEHICLE CREDENTIALS.

EVEN SO, ACTIVITY ON ALL THE LME\u2019S CORE CONTRACTS FELL LAST YEAR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NICKEL, THE TOP PRICE PERFORMER AMONG THE BASE METALS IN 2019, AND TIN, THE WEAKEST PRICE PERFORMER. THE SAME TWO METALS WERE THE ONLY TWO TO REGISTER HIGHER VOLUMES IN SHANGHAI.  TIN REMAINS A TINY FUTURES MARKET BY COMPARISON WITH NICKEL BUT EVEN IT DWARFS THE LME\u2019S ALUMINIUM ALLOY CONTRACT, WHICH WITH VOLUME GROWTH OF 7% WAS THE UNLIKELY STAR PERFORMER LAST YEAR.  THAT OUTPERFORMANCE, HOWEVER, SHOULD BE SEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF FALLING ACTIVITY IN EACH OF THE PREVIOUS FOUR YEARS.  NEW PRODUCTS  THE LME LAUNCHED TWO NEW ALUMINIUM PREMIUM CONTRACTS IN MARCH LAST YEAR BUT WITH ONLY LIMITED SUCCESS. THE NORTH AMERICAN CONTRACT TRADED JUST 939 LOTS WHILE THE EUROPEAN PRODUCT FAILED TO TRADE AT ALL.  CME, WHICH LAUNCHED THE FIRST OF ITS FOUR ALUMINIUM PREMIUM CONTRACTS AS FAR BACK AS 2013, APPEARS TO HAVE CAPTURED THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE MARKET WITH TOTAL VOLUMES LAST YEAR OF 152,353 CONTRACTS.  ITS UNDERLYING ALUMINIUM CONTRACT LOOKED IN DANGER OF DISAPPEARING ALTOGETHER WITH NO TRADES AT ALL IN 2018 BUT THE CONTRACT SPRANG INTO LIFE IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2019 AFTER CME EXTENDED PHYSICAL DELIVERY TO ASIAN LOCATIONS SUCH AS SINGAPORE AND THE MALAYSIAN PORTS OF JOHOR AND PORT KLANG. THEY CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR 9,291 TONNES OF CME\u2019S TOTAL 17,145 TONNES OF REGISTERED ALUMINIUM STOCKS.  CME ZINC STOCKS HAVE SHRUNK TO JUST 6 TONNES AND THE CONTRACT, WHICH DIDN\u2019T TRADE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, LOOKS PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO FOLLOWING THE CME LEAD CONTRACT INTO OBLIVION.  VOLUMES IN THE CME\u2019S COPPER OPTIONS CONTRACT DOUBLED YEAR-ON-YEAR AND THE EXCHANGE\u2019S WEEKLY OPTIONS CONTRACTS, LAUNCHED IN 2018, STEADILY GAINED TRACTION OVER THE COURSE OF 2019.  AS DID THE SHFE COPPER OPTIONS CONTRACT, ALSO LAUNCHED IN 2018. ALMOST 8.4 MILLION LOTS TRADED IN 2019 WITH OPEN INTEREST IN DECEMBER STANDING AT 64,526 LOTS, UP 16% ON DECEMBER 2018.  MORE NEW BASE METAL PRODUCTS WERE LAUNCHED LAST YEAR BY HONG KONG EXCHANGES AND CLEARING (HKEX), THE OWNER OF THE LME.  A SUITE OF DOLLAR-DENOMINATED \u201cMINI\u201d CONTRACTS APPEAR TO BE SUCCEEDING WHERE THE YUAN-DENOMINATED OFFERING HAS LARGELY FAILED. TOTAL VOLUME WAS 29,334 CONTRACTS SINCE LAUNCH IN AUGUST, COMPARED WITH JUST 237 OVER THE WHOLE YEAR FOR THE CHINESE CURRENCY PRODUCTS.  THE NEW STEEL FRONTIER  ALL THREE EXCHANGES ARE ALSO MAKING STEADY INROADS INTO THE FERROUS SECTOR, WHICH HAS HISTORICALLY PROVED STUBBORNLY RESISTANT TO FUTURES TRADING.  THE LME\u2019S SCRAP AND REBAR CONTRACTS HAVE TRADED SINCE THE START OF 2018 AND ARE SEEING RESPECTABLE ACTIVITY. TWO NEW CONTRACTS, COVERING HOT ROLLED COIL (HRC) IN CHINA AND NORTH AMERICA, HAVE SEEN VOLUMES BUILD SINCE TRADING STARTED IN MARCH LAST YEAR. THE FORMER SET A NEW MONTHLY VOLUME RECORD OF 16,297 LOTS IN DECEMBER, BRINGING THE 2019 TOTAL TO 45,884 LOTS.  THE EXCHANGE HAS DROPPED PLENTY OF HINTS IT WILL CONSIDER BUILDING OUT ITS FERROUS PORTFOLIO FURTHER, GIVEN THE LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION IN THE CURRENT OFFERINGS.  IT\u2019S NOTICEABLE THAT THE CME\u2019S HRC CONTRACT HAS SEEN INCREASED ACTION SINCE THE LME RE-ENTERED THE STEEL SECTOR AFTER THE FAILURE OF ITS FORMER BILLET CONTRACT. CME VOLUMES GREW BY 89% IN 2018 AND BY ANOTHER 45% LAST YEAR, WHEN THE EQUIVALENT OF ALMOST 3.5 MILLION TONNES TRADED.  SHFE CURRENTLY RUNS THE HIGHEST-VOLUME GLOBAL STEEL CONTRACT. STEEL REBAR VOLUMES DROPPED 12% LAST YEAR BUT STILL TOTAL LED 930 MILLION CONTRACTS. EVEN ALLOWING FOR THE FACT THAT SHFE DOUBLE-COUNTS ITS VOLUMES, A PRACTICE THAT CHANGED AT THE START OF 2020, IT\u2019S STILL A STAGGERING FIGURE.  THE CHINESE EXCHANGE LAST YEAR EXTENDED ITS FERROUS PRODUCT RANGE WITH A NEW STAINLESS CONTRACT, WHICH TRADED 1.2 MILLION LOTS IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS.  QIANHAI SURPRISE  NOT ALL NEW PRODUCTS FLOURISH AND THE LME\u2019S NEW COBALT AND MOLYBDENUM CONTRACTS FAILED TO GET ANY TRACTION LAST YEAR.  THE LACK OF INTEREST IN THE NEW CASH-SETTLED COBALT CONTRACT IS PUZZLING, GIVEN THE STEADY DECLINE IN ACTIVITY IN THE OLDER PHYSICALLY DELIVERABLE CONTRACT, WHICH SAW VOLUMES SLUMP BY 26% LAST YEAR. IT\u2019S NOT AS IF COBALT HASN\u2019T BEEN VOLATILE OR THAT CARMAKERS HAVEN\u2019T EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR A WAY OF HEDGING A KEY INPUT INTO ELECTRIC BATTERIES.  ALSO STRANGE IS THE LACK OF TRACTION GAINED BY EITHER THE CME OR LME ALUMINA CONTRACTS, GIVEN THE SECTOR HAS SWITCHED TOWARDS SPOT PRICING.  CME ALUMINA VOLUMES FELL BY 79% LAST YEAR TO 118,200 TONNES, WHILE THE LME\u2019S NEW ALUMINA CONTRACT NOTCHED UP TRADES OF JUST 46,000 TONNES.  BOTH WERE ECLIPSED BY THE 374,011 TONNES TRADED ON THE QIANHAI MERCANTILE EXCHANGE, HKEX\u2019S FORAY INTO MAINLAND CHINA.  THE QME IS SOMETHING OF AN ANOMALY IN THE GLOBAL METALS EXCHANGE WORLD. BARRED FROM OFFERING FUTURES PRODUCTS IN MAINLAND CHINA, HKEX HAS BEEN BUILDING OUT A PHYSICAL EXCHANGE.  ALUMINA WAS ONE OF FIVE METALLIC OFFERINGS LAUNCHED LAST YEAR. THE OTHERS ARE COPPER CATHODE, COPPER ROD, ALUMINIUM INGOT AND ALUMINIUM BILLET.  IT\u2019S TAKEN SEVERAL YEARS FOR HKEX TO GET THE QME UP AND RUNNING BUT IT IS WORTH WATCHING BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS A CLEAR CHALLENGE TO THE CHINESE INCUMBENT IN SHANGHAI.  THE BIG THREE EXCHANGES CURRENTLY CO-EXIST IN A RELATIVELY PEACEFUL ORDER. WHAT THE CHINESE LIKE TO CALL A \u201cWIN-WIN\u201d SCENARIO MAY NOT LAST LONG IF QME PICKS UP TRADING MOMENTUM.", "Ticker": "CME", "Date": "2020-01-10T00:00:00", "key": "20200110CME", "labelr0": -1.6213364033194202, "labelr1": -0.4632112730996231, "labelr2": -0.2841187420397689, "labelr3": 0.7123206916879488, "labelr4": 1.0438515194380835, "pos": 0.0, "neg": 0.191, "compound": -0.3818, "0_day_return": -1.6213364033194178, "1_day_return": -1.6213364033194178, "2_day_return": -0.7460139450972902, "3_day_return": -0.03900726510315256, "4_day_return": 1.0044370764054733, "label": -1, "return": 0.0069762152039844535, "excess_return": -1.6283126185234025, "count_of_word": 1151, "pred": -1, "prof-1": 0.73361224, "prof1": 0.26638779999999995, "fst_sentencepc_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_pred": -1, "linearsgdlog_prof_-1": 0.5029548857287194, "linearsgdlog_prof_1": 0.4970451142712806, "fst_sentencepc_prof-1": 0.73361224, "fst_sentencepc_prof1": 0.26638779999999995, "vader_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_pred": -1, "fst_spacy_prof-1": 0.63761914, "fst_spacy_prof1": 0.3623808, "tr_pred": -1, "tr_prof-1": 0.5171162, "tr_prof1": 0.48288387, "fst_spacy_pred2": -1, "fst_spacy_prof2-1": 0.43608168, "fst_spacy_prof21": 0.5639183000000001, "fst_sentencepc_pred2": -1, "fst_sentencepc_prof2-1": 0.5931922, "fst_sentencepc_prof21": 0.40680778, "headline_pred": 1, "headline_prof2-1": 0.31144327, "headline_prof21": 0.68855673, "textplusheadline_pred": -1, "textplusheadline_prof2-1": 0.55452156, "textplusheadline_prof21": 0.44547844, "tr_headlineplustext_pred": 1, "tr_headlineplustext_prof-1": 0.4296634, "tr_headlineplustext_prof1": 0.57033664, "tr_headline_prof-1": 0.5086893, "tr_headline_prof1": 0.49131066, "tr_headline_pred": -1, "vader_score": -1, "returnpred": 1.6213364033194178, "returnpredvader": 1.6213364033194178, "returnpredsgd": 1.6213364033194178, "returnfst_spacy_pred": 1.6213364033194178, "returnfst_sentencepc_pred2": 1.6213364033194178, "returnheadline_pred": -1.6213364033194178, "returntextplusheadline_pred": 1.6213364033194178, "returntr_headlineplustext_pred": -1.6213364033194178, "returntr_headline_pred": 1.6213364033194178, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0229408816193026, "dailyaveragereturnvader": 0.9751898378088888, "dailyaveragereturnsgd": 0.979797440948375, "dailyaveragereturnfst_spacy_pred": 1.016796238893964, "dailyaveragereturnfst_sentencepc_pred2": 0.0, "dailyaveragereturnreturnfst_sentencepc_pred2": 0.9880061742650615, "dailyaveragereturnreturnheadline_pred": 0.9927890474286503, "dailyaveragereturnreturntextplusheadline_pred": 0.9933999772873356, "dailyaveragereturnreturntr_headlineplustext_pred": 1.0210234219035756, "dailyaveragereturnreturntr_headline_pred": 0.9825573114006859, "cumreturn1b": 4.190110128822429, "cumreturn1d": 1.1716529407507665, "cumreturn1e": 1.4532175239604481, "cumreturn1f": 1.0904877056311, "cumreturn1g": 0.0, "cumreturn1h": 0.8356066113673851, "cumreturn1i": 1.0498682287811774, "cumreturn1j": 3.2996078289432402, "cumreturn1k": 2.206317452763434, "cumreturndow": 1.3099962331167778, "cumreturnsp500": 1.2381886972490583}, {"Unnamed: 0": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16924, "Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1": 16924, "level_0": 16924, "index": 16924, "text": "JAN 13 (REUTERS) - ACASTI PHARMA INC SAID ON MONDAY ITS KRILL OIL-DERIVED DRUG CANDIDATE, CAPRE, WAS NOT MORE EFFECTIVE THAN PLACEBO IN REDUCING HIGH LEVELS OF TRIGLYCERIDES IN A LATE-STAGE STUDY.

IT STANDS VIRTUALLY ALONE AMONG RIVALS IN HAVING LITTLE IF ANY NEED FOR THE USUAL METRICS THAT MEDIA COMPANIES ABIDE BY. INSTEAD, INVESTORS HAVE FOCUSED ON ITS RAPID SUBSCRIBER AND REVENUE GROWTH. THAT HAS FUELED ITS STOCK-MARKET SUCCESS. BUT THE $150 BILLION VIDEO-STREAMING SERVICE\u2019S FOURTH-QUARTER PERFORMANCE, UNVEILED ON TUESDAY, SHOWS HOW THAT IS COMING UNDER THREAT.  NETFLIX SHARES ARE UP MORE THAN FIVEFOLD SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2015, ECLIPSING WALT DISNEY, COMCAST AND AT&T DURING THE SAME PERIOD. ALL THREE HAVE LAUNCHED OR HAVE PLANS FOR DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER SERVICES TO GO HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH NETFLIX.  THE FIRM LED BY REED HASTINGS STANDS APART IN KEY WAYS. FIRST, IT DOESN\u2019T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT TV RATINGS BECAUSE IT\u2019S COMMERCIAL-FREE. THAT\u2019S IN CONTRAST TO COMCAST\u2019S NBC UNIVERSAL, DISNEY\u2019S BROADCAST AND CABLE UNITS AND AT&T\u2019S TURNER SUITE OF CHANNELS. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WATCH A TV SERIES INFORMS HOW MUCH A NETWORK CAN CHARGE FOR ADVERTISING AND CAN BOLSTER NEGOTIATIONS WITH DISTRIBUTORS DURING CONTRACT RENEWALS.  BOX-OFFICE TICKET SALES ARE FOLLOWED OBSESSIVELY IN TINSELTOWN BECAUSE THEY PROVE THE POPULARITY AND VIABILITY OF A MOVIE.

REVENUE IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 BARELY BEAT ANALYSTS\u2019 ESTIMATES, BUT THERE ARE OTHER SIGNS OF STRAIN. THE NET INCREASE IN U.S. SUBSCRIBERS IS WANING IN PART THANKS TO A PRICE HIKE AND NEW ENTRANTS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, NETFLIX MISSED ITS OWN DOMESTIC OUTLOOK FORECAST AS IT DID IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS.

FILE PHOTO: GENERAL MOTORS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER MARY BARRA ANNOUNCES A MAJOR INVESTMENT FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF GM FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES AT THE GM ORION ASSEMBLY PLANT IN LAKE ORION, MICHIGAN, U.S. MARCH 22, 2019. REUTERS/REBECCA COOK/FILE PHOTO  GM CHIEF EXECUTIVE MARY BARRA AND TOP EXECUTIVES HOSTED AN INVESTOR CONFERENCE IN NEW YORK TO CONVINCE POTENTIAL SHAREHOLDERS GM IS A BURGEONING TECHNOLOGY FIRM AT THE FOREFRONT OF TOMORROW\u2019S ELECTRIC AND SELF-DRIVING CARS.  \u201cWE BELIEVE WE\u2019RE A COMPELLING INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY,\u201d GM CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER DHIVYA SURYADEVARA TOLD REPORTERS AFTER GM REPORTED QUARTERLY RESULTS, WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE RUN-UP IN TESLA\u2019S STOCK.  \u201cFROM A SHARE-PRICE STANDPOINT, WE\u2019RE VERY BULLISH ON THE FUTURE,\u201d SHE ADDED.  BARRA HAS BEEN RESTRUCTURING GM\u2019S OPERATIONS AND STRESSING HER GOALS OF READYING GM FOR A FUTURE OF \u201cZERO EMISSIONS AND ZERO ACCIDENTS\u201d FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  STILL, GM SHARES TRADE JUST ABOVE THE $33 SHARE PRICE OF ITS 2010 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING. THAT HAS LEFT IT WITH A MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF ABOUT $49 BILLION, BELOW TESLA\u2019S VALUATION OF ABOUT $130 BILLION.  \u201cTHE MARKET\u2019S GOT IT WRONG,\u201d SAID CHRIS SUSANIN, CO-PORTFOLIO MANAGER WITH LEVIN EASTERLY PARTNERS, WHICH OWNS SHARES IN GM BUT NOT TESLA. \u201cGM SHOULD BE THE $150 BILLION MARKET CAP, NOT TESLA.\u201d  THE BULK OF GM\u2019S PROFITS IS STILL DERIVED FROM THE FUEL-HUNGRY PICKUP TRUCKS AND SUVS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES. THE CHINESE MARKET HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF A STEADY $2 BILLION IN PROFITS A YEAR, BUT THAT IS THREATENED BY A MARKET SLOWDOWN, RISING COSTS FOR ELECTRIFICATION AND NOW THE DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK.  WHILE CHINA WILL DELIVER LOWER EQUITY INCOME TO GM IN THE NEAR TERM, IT REMAINS A SOLID CONTRIBUTOR THAT IS PROFITABLE AND DIVIDEND PAYING, AND WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVS GLOBALLY, OFFICIALS SAID. GM ALSO SEES GROWTH FOR ITS CADILLAC BRAND IN CHINA.  \u2018HAVE OUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO\u2019  BARRA\u2019S CHALLENGE NOW IS TO ASSURE INVESTORS THAT GM CAN MAKE THE LEAP ACROSS THE GAP SEPARATING ITS PROFITABLE INTERNAL COMBUSTION PRESENT AND AN UNCERTAIN ELECTRIC FUTURE.  WHILE GASOLINE-POWERED VEHICLES WILL MAKE UP A LARGE PORTION OF U.S. SALES INTO THE 2030S, GM HAS SAID IT WILL SPEND MORE ON DEVELOPING ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAN THOSE WITH INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.  GM LAID OUT A MORE DETAILED PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF EVS AND SELF-DRIVING VEHICLES AT THE INVESTOR DAY, INCLUDING ITS CRUISE SELF-DRIVING UNIT.  SOME ANALYSTS HAVE SUGGESTED GM SHOULD SPIN OFF CRUISE, BUT SURYADEVARA SAID GM HAS NO PLANS TO DO THAT. SHE ADDED THAT SPENDING IN 2020 ON THAT BUSINESS WILL ROUGHLY MATCH LAST YEAR\u2019S $800 MILLION.  CRUISE CEO DAN AMMANN SAID THE SELF-DRIVING MARKET OPPORTUNITY TOTALS $8 TRILLION.  ONE OF THE AUDIENCES FOR THE INVESTOR DAY IS POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES AS GM COMPETES WITH TESLA AND OTHER AUTOMAKERS GLOBALLY TO HIRE TOP ENGINEERS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS OUTSIDE OF DETROIT, HIGHLIGHTING TECHNICAL CENTERS IN ONTARIO AND ISRAEL.  BARRA, ASKED WHETHER TESLA\u2019S EVENTUAL ELECTRIC PICKUP OFFERING COULD SQUEEZE GM\u2019S MARGINS, SAID HER COMPANY UNDERSTANDS THAT BUSINESS. \u201cI THINK WE CAN HAVE OUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO,\u201d SHE SAID.  GM ALSO SAID IT WILL OFFER ITS SUPERCRUISE PARTIALLY AUTOMATED DRIVING SYSTEM ON 22 MODELS BY THE END OF 2023, GM PRESIDENT MARK REUSS SAID.  GM ALSO LAID OUT ITS PLAN TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING COMPLEXITY THIS YEAR BY ELIMINATING 25% OF THE PARTS USED IN ITS PLANTS. BARRA ALSO SAID GM TARGETS SOURCING ALL OF ITS GLOBAL ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES BY 2040, A DECADE SOONER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROMISED.

HC2 HOLDINGS INC (HCHC.N) SAID ON THURSDAY THAT IT REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH ACTIVIST INVESTOR MG CAPITAL TO BRING FOUR NEWCOMERS ONTO THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY BEING RUN BY FORMER HEDGE FUND MANAGER PHILIP FALCONE.  THE SETTLEMENT BRINGS TO AN END A PROXY CONTEST BETWEEN A FIRST-TIME ACTIVIST MICHAEL GORZYNSKI, WHO RUNS MG CAPITAL, AND FALCONE, WHO CEMENTED HIS FAME WITH BETS AGAINST THE HOUSING MARKET DURING THE LAST FINANCIAL CRISIS.  GORZYNSKI HAD CRITICIZED FALCONE\u2019S HANDPICKED BOARD FOR POOR GOVERNANCE, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND MISSING REGULATORY ISSUES, AND PUSHED TO HAVE HIM REMOVED. GORZYNSKI SAID HE WANTED TO CUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL COSTS AND REFOCUS ON HC2\u2019S CORE HOLDINGS.  MG CAPITAL, WHICH PUSHED TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE BOARD, HAS RECEIVED TWO SEATS WITH THE FIRST ONE GOING TO GORZYNSKI AND THE SECOND TO KENNETH COURTIS, WHO WAS ONE OF MG\u2019S SIX DIRECTOR CANDIDATES, ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT.  ADDITIONALLY, AVRAM \u201cAVIE\u201d GLAZER, AN INVESTOR WITH A ROUGHLY 5.3% STAKE IN HC2, ALSO JOINED THE BOARD AND WAS NAMED ITS CHAIRMAN.  HC2 SAID LAST MONTH THAT IT PLANNED TO PUT GLAZER, WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE CO-CHAIRMAN AND DIRECTOR OF SOCCER CLUB MANCHESTER UNITED PLC (MANU.N), ONTO ITS SLATE FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO VOTE ON AT THE ANNUAL MEETING IN JULY.  THE FOURTH BOARD SEAT HAS GONE TO SHELLY LOMBARD, A REPRESENTATIVE OF HC2 SHAREHOLDER JDS1.  AFTER NEW ADDITIONS, THE BOARD WOULD EXPAND TO 10 MEMBERS FROM SIX AND WOULD BE REDUCED TO SEVEN AFTER THIS YEAR\u2019S ANNUAL MEETING IN JULY, THE COMPANY SAID IN A STATEMENT.  AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT, MG CAPITAL HAS ALSO WITHDRAWN ITS CONSENT SOLICITATION AND NOMINATION FOR ELECTION OF DIRECTORS AT THE 2020 ANNUAL MEETING.  MG CAPITAL COULD NOT BE IMMEDIATELY REACHED FOR COMMENT.  REUTERS REPORTED ON WEDNESDAY THAT THE TWO SIDES WERE NEARING A SETTLEMENT.  THIS WAS ONE OF ONLY A FEW CAMPAIGNS THAT HAD NOT SETTLED QUICKLY THIS YEAR AS THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK SHUTTERED MUCH OF THE U.S. ECONOMY.  IT PITTED GORZYNSKI, WHO ONCE WORKED FOR PROMINENT HEDGE FUND MANAGER DANIEL LOEB, AGAINST FALCONE, A FORMER BILLIONAIRE WHOSE BET AGAINST THE OVERHEATED HOUSING MARKET EARNED HIS FUND HARBINGER CAPITAL A 116% RETURN IN 2007.  IN THE LAST DECADE, FALCONE HAS TURNED FROM FUND INVESTOR TO CORPORATE EXECUTIVE.

PETROLEO BRASILEIRO SA, AS THE FIRM IS FORMALLY KNOWN, HAD THROTTLED BACK OIL PRODUCTION BY 200,000 BARRELS PER DAY IN EARLY APRIL, OR ALMOST 10% OF ITS OUTPUT, ON FEARS THAT WEAK GLOBAL DEMAND AMID THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC DEMAND WOULD LEAVE THE COMPANY WITHOUT PLACES TO STORE CRUDE.  OTHER MAJOR OIL COMPANIES ALSO SCALED BACK PRODUCTION SIGNIFICANTLY, INCLUDING CHEVRON CORP\u2019S CUTBACKS IN THE PERMIAN BASIN. BUT WITHIN A MONTH PETROBRAS HAD REVERSED ITS CUTS, SURPRISING MANY.  ON THURSDAY NIGHT, THE COMPANY POSTED MARGINS THAT BEAT EXPECTATIONS, EVEN AS IT TOOK A $11 BILLION IMPAIRMENT ON ITS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION ASSETS.
