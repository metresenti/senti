(4)  THE FIVE LARGEST COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURES, COMBINED, FOR THIS CATEGORY REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 2% OF THE TOTAL NET CREDIT EXPOSURE.  INVESTING CASH FLOWS  NET CASH USED IN DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $403 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH AND RESTRICTED CASH ACQUIRED IN THE SCANA COMBINATION AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF BLUE RACER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PLANT CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER PROPERTY ADDITIONS.  FINANCING CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY  DOMINION ENERGY RELIES ON CAPITAL MARKETS AS SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS NOT SATISFIED BY CASH PROVIDED BY ITS OPERATIONS. AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN  CREDIT RATINGS  AND  DEBT COVENANTS  IN MD&A IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE ABILITY TO BORROW FUNDS OR ISSUE SECURITIES AND THE RETURN DEMANDED BY INVESTORS ARE AFFECTED BY CREDIT RATINGS. IN ADDITION, THE RAISING OF EXTERNAL CAPITAL IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING REGISTRATION WITH THE SEC FOR CERTAIN ISSUANCES.  DOMINION ENERGY CURRENTLY MEETS THE DEFINITION OF A WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER UNDER SEC RULES GOVERNING THE REGISTRATION, COMMUNICATIONS AND OFFERING PROCESSES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. THE RULES PROVIDE FOR A STREAMLINED SHELF REGISTRATION PROCESS TO PROVIDE REGISTRANTS WITH TIMELY ACCESS TO CAPITAL. THIS ALLOWS DOMINION ENERGY TO USE AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENTS TO REGISTER ANY OFFERING OF SECURITIES, OTHER THAN THOSE FOR EXCHANGE OFFERS OR BUSINESS COMBINATION TRANSACTIONS.  NET CASH USED BY DOMINION ENERGY'S FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $291 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET DEBT REPAYMENTS IN 2019 COMPARED TO NET DEBT ISSUANCES IN 2018, LOWER ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK AND HIGHER COMMON DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2019 EQUITY UNITS.  IN NOVEMBER 2017, DOMINION ENERGY FILED AN SEC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SALE OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF VARIABLE DENOMINATION FLOATING RATE DEMAND NOTES, CALLED DOMINION ENERGY RELIABILITY INVESTMENT  SM  . THE REGISTRATION LIMITS THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT THAT MAY BE OUTSTANDING AT ANY ONE TIME TO $1.0 BILLION. THE NOTES ARE OFFERED ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS AND BEAR INTEREST AT A FLOATING RATE PER ANNUM DETERMINED BY THE DOMINION ENERGY RELIABILITY INVESTMENT COMMITTEE, OR ITS DESIGNEE, ON A WEEKLY BASIS. THE NOTES HAVE NO STATED MATURITY DATE, ARE NON-TRANSFERABLE AND MAY BE REDEEMED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY DOMINION ENERGY OR AT THE INVESTOR\u2019S OPTION AT ANY TIME. THE BALANCE AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 WAS $21 MILLION. THE NOTES ARE SHORT-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS ON DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE PROCEEDS WILL BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES AND TO REPAY DEBT.  116  IN JANUARY 2019, DOMINION ENERGY ACQUIRED ALL OUTSTANDING PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS OF DOMINION ENERGY MIDSTREAM NOT OWNED BY DOMINION ENERGY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF 22.5 MILLION COMMON SHARES. SEE NOTE 1  7  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  IN JANUARY 2019, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SCANA COMBINATION, DOMINION ENERGY ISSUED 95.6 MILLION SHARES OF DOMINION ENERGY COMMON STOCK, VALUED AT $6.8 BILLION, REPRESENTING 0.6690 OF A SHARE OF DOMINION ENERGY COMMON STOCK FOR EACH SHARE OF SCANA COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING AT CLOSING. SCANA\u2019S OUTSTANDING DEBT TOTALED $6.9 BILLION AT CLOSING.  IN JUNE 2019, DOMINION ENERGY ISSUED $1.6 BILLION OF 2019 EQUITY UNITS, INITIALLY IN THE FORM OF 2019 SERIES A CORPORATE UNITS.

USE OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS DISCLOSED IN MD&A IN THE COMPANIES' ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  FUTURE ISSUES AND OTHER MATTERS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF FUTURE ISSUES AND OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDES CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS OF PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED MATTERS AND NEW ISSUES ARISING DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY, AND SUBSEQUENT TO, THE DATES OF DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT MAY IMPACT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND/OR CASH FLOWS. THIS SECTION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH  ITEM 1. BUSINESS  AND  FUTURE ISSUES AND OTHER MATTERS  IN MD&A IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018,  FUTURE ISSUES AND OTHER MATTERS  IN MD&A IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  DOMINION ENERGY IS SUBJECT TO COSTS RESULTING FROM A NUMBER OF FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS DESIGNED TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECT FUTURE PLANNING AND EXISTING OPERATIONS. THEY CAN RESULT IN INCREASED CAPITAL, OPERATING AND OTHER COSTS AS A RESULT OF COMPLIANCE, REMEDIATION, CONTAINMENT AND MONITORING OBLIGATIONS. SEE NOTE 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND NOTE 18 IN THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  117  STATE ACTIONS RELATED TO AIR  AND GHG EMISSIONS  IN AUGUST 2017, THE OZONE TRANSPORT COMMISSION RELEASED A DRAFT MODEL RULE FOR CONTROL OF NO  X  EMISSIONS FROM NATURAL GAS PIPELINE COMPRESSOR FUEL-FIRE PRIME MOVERS. STATES WITHIN THE OZONE TRANSPORT REGION, INCLUDING STATES IN WHICH DOMINION ENERGY HAS NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS, ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP REASONABLY ACHIEVABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY RULES FOR EXISTING SOURCES BASED ON THE OZONE TRANSPORT COMMISSION MODEL RULE. STATES OUTSIDE OF THE OZONE TRANSPORT COMMISSION MAY ALSO CONSIDER THE MODEL RULES IN SETTING NEW REASONABLY ACHIEVABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS.  IN MAY 2019, VDEQ ISSUED A FINAL RULE ESTABLISHING A STATE CARBON REGULATION PROGRAM. SEVERAL OTHER STATES IN WHICH DOMINION ENERGY OPERATES, INCLUDING PENNSYLVANIA, NEW YORK, MARYLAND AND OHIO ARE DEVELOPING OR HAVE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO DEVELOP STATE SPECIFIC REGULATIONS TO CONTROL GHG EMISSIONS, INCLUDING METHANE.  DOMINION ENERGY CANNOT CURRENTLY ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACTS RELATED TO THESE MATTERS, BUT THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL IMPACT TO ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND/OR CASH FLOWS.  LEGAL MATTERS  SEE  NOTES 3, 13 AND 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, NOTES 13 AND 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND NOTES 13 AND 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON VARIOUS LEGAL MATTERS.  REGULATORY MATTERS  SEE NOTES 3 AND 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON VARIOUS REGULATORY MATTERS.  ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE  IN SEPTEMBER 2014, DOMINION ENERGY, ALONG WITH DUKE AND SOUTHERN COMPANY GAS, ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE. ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE IS FOCUSED ON CONSTRUCTING AN APPROXIMATELY 600-MILE NATURAL GAS PIPELINE RUNNING FROM WEST VIRGINIA THROUGH VIRGINIA TO NORTH CAROLINA. DURING THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2018, A FERC STOP WORK ORDER TOGETHER WITH DELAYS IN OBTAINING PERMITS NECESSARY FOR CONSTRUCTION AND DELAYS IN CONSTRUCTION DUE TO JUDICIAL ACTIONS IMPACTED THE COST AND SCHEDULE FOR THE PROJECT.  AS A RESULT, PROJECT COST ESTIMATES HAVE INCREASED FROM BETWEEN $6.0 BILLION TO $6.5 BILLION TO BETWEEN $7.0 BILLION TO $7.5 BILLION, EXCLUDING FINANCING COSTS. ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE A LATE 2020 IN-SERVICE DATE FOR AT LEAST KEY SEGMENTS OF THE PROJECT, WHILE THE REMAINDER MAY EXTEND INTO EARLY 2021. ALTERNATIVELY, IF IT TAKES LONGER TO RESOLVE THE JUDICIAL ISSUES, SUCH AS THROUGH RESOLUTION OF THE APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE U.S. FILED IN JUNE 2019, FULL IN-SERVICE COULD EXTEND TO THE END OF 2021 WITH TOTAL PROJECT COST ESTIMATED TO INCREASE AN ADDITIONAL $250 MILLION, RESULTING IN TOTAL PROJECT COST ESTIMATES OF $7.25 BILLION TO $7.75 BILLION, EXCLUDING FINANCING COSTS. ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE IS ALSO EVALUATING POSSIBLE LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES.  PROJECT CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES, SCHEDULES AND COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY DUE TO PERMITTING AND/OR WORK DELAYS (INCLUDING DUE TO JUDICIAL OR REGULATORY ACTION), ABNORMAL WEATHER AND OTHER CONDITIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN COST OR SCHEDULE MODIFICATIONS IN THE FUTURE, A SUSPENSION OF AFUDC FOR ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE AND/OR IMPAIRMENT CHARGES POTENTIALLY MATERIAL TO DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S CASH FLOWS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  118", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "DOMINION ENERGY INC /VA/", "CIK": 715957, "Date": "2019-08-01T00:00:00", "Ticker": "D", "Name": "Dominion Resources Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 4911.0, "Business": "VA", "Incorporated": "VA", "IRS": 541229715.0, "key": "20190801D", "labelr1": 0.14490844421024826, "labelr2": -1.7758484609313263, "labelr3": 0.7365742600776712, "labelr4": -1.050252592395629, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.520967, "prof1": 0.479033, "return1&2": 1.0162836666234485, "return1&2&3": 1.0087979827257263, "return1&2&3&4": 1.019392909691338, "return2": 1.0177584846093133, "return1": 0.9985509155578975, "return3": 0.9926342573992232, "return4": 1.0105025259239564, "1_day_return": 0.1449084442102455, "cumulative_return1": 1.3794441113912808, "cumulative_return1&2": 3.44347226151521, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 19.725641751048414, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 209.61290997128623, "indexx": 1576, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9839245301932817, "cumreturn1b": 0.9839245301932817, "cumreturndow": 0.9927172599946105, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9962980626161437}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1650, "level_0": 1696, "index": 11180, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-Q, AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND RISK FACTORS CONTAINED IN THE FORM 10-K. WE INTEND FOR THIS DISCUSSION TO PROVIDE THE READER WITH INFORMATION THAT WILL ASSIST IN UNDERSTANDING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE CHANGES IN CERTAIN KEY ITEMS IN THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT ACCOUNTED FOR THOSE CHANGES, AS WELL AS HOW CERTAIN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE DISCUSSION ALSO PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO PROVIDE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THOSE SEGMENTS AND THEIR RESULTS AFFECT THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF AMEREN AS A WHOLE. ALSO SEE THE GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONS AT THE FRONT OF THIS REPORT AND IN THE FORM 10-K.  39  AMEREN, HEADQUARTERED IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI, IS A PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY WHOSE PRIMARY ASSETS ARE ITS EQUITY INTERESTS IN ITS SUBSIDIARIES. AMEREN\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES ARE SEPARATE, INDEPENDENT LEGAL ENTITIES WITH SEPARATE BUSINESSES, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES. DIVIDENDS ON AMEREN\u2019S COMMON STOCK AND THE PAYMENT OF EXPENSES BY AMEREN DEPEND ON DISTRIBUTIONS MADE TO IT BY ITS SUBSIDIARIES. AMEREN\u2019S PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE LISTED BELOW. AMEREN HAS OTHER SUBSIDIARIES THAT CONDUCT OTHER ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS PROVIDING SHARED SERVICES.  \u2022  UNION ELECTRIC COMPANY, DOING BUSINESS AS AMEREN MISSOURI, OPERATES A RATE-REGULATED ELECTRIC GENERATION, TRANSMISSION, AND DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS AND A RATE-REGULATED NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS IN MISSOURI.  \u2022  AMEREN ILLINOIS COMPANY, DOING BUSINESS AS AMEREN ILLINOIS, OPERATES RATE-REGULATED ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION, ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION, AND NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES IN ILLINOIS.  \u2022  ATXI OPERATES A FERC RATE-REGULATED ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION BUSINESS. ATXI PLACED THE SPOON RIVER PROJECT IN SERVICE IN FEBRUARY 2018, AND IS DEVELOPING THE MISO-APPROVED ILLINOIS RIVERS AND MARK TWAIN ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION PROJECTS.  AMEREN\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AND THEREFORE INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF ITS MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. ALL INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS HAVE NO SUBSIDIARIES. ALL TABULAR DOLLAR AMOUNTS ARE IN MILLIONS, UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED.  IN ADDITION TO PRESENTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS AMOUNTS IN TOTAL, WE PRESENT CERTAIN INFORMATION IN CENTS PER SHARE. THESE AMOUNTS REFLECT FACTORS THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT AMEREN\u2019S EARNINGS. WE BELIEVE THIS PER SHARE INFORMATION HELPS READERS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS ON AMEREN\u2019S EARNINGS PER SHARE.  OVERVIEW  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO AMEREN COMMON SHAREHOLDERS IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WAS $179 MILLION  , OR  72  CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED WITH $239 MILLION  , OR  97  CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO AMEREN COMMON SHAREHOLDERS IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WAS $370 MILLION  , OR $1.50  PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED WITH $390 MILLION  , OR $1.59  PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD. NET INCOME FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE YEAR-AGO PERIODS, WAS UNFAVORABLY AFFECTED BY MILDER EARLY SUMMER TEMPERATURES EXPERIENCED IN 2019 AND INCREASED OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE CALLAWAY ENERGY CENTER\u2019S SCHEDULED REFUELING AND MAINTENANCE OUTAGE THAT WAS COMPLETED IN MAY 2019, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE BENEFIT OF INCREASED INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AT AMEREN TRANSMISSION AND AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION, EACH OF WHICH BENEFITS FROM FORMULAIC RATEMAKING. NET INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD, WAS ALSO FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY TIMING DIFFERENCES IN 2018 BETWEEN INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND REVENUE REDUCTIONS RELATED TO FEDERAL TAX REFORM, WHICH WILL AFFECT 2019 QUARTERLY EARNINGS COMPARISONS BUT IS NOT EXPECTED TO AFFECT THE FULL-YEAR COMPARISON. NET INCOME FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD, WAS ALSO FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY MEEIA PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES AND INCREASED EARNINGS AT AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS AS A RESULT OF HIGHER DELIVERY SERVICE RATES AND A CHANGE IN RATE DESIGN, WHICH CONCENTRATES MORE REVENUES IN THE WINTER HEATING SEASON DUE TO AN INCREASE IN VOLUMETRIC RATES BUT DOES NOT AFFECT FULL-YEAR EARNINGS COMPARISONS.  AMEREN\u2019S STRATEGIC PLAN INCLUDES INVESTING IN, AND OPERATING ITS UTILITIES IN, A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS, ENHANCING THOSE FRAMEWORKS, AND ADVOCATING FOR RESPONSIBLE ENERGY AND ECONOMIC POLICIES, AS WELL AS CREATING AND CAPITALIZING ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTMENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS. AMEREN REMAINS FOCUSED ON DISCIPLINED COST MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGIC CAPITAL ALLOCATION. AMEREN BELIEVES IT HAS CONSTRUCTIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS FOR INVESTMENT AT ALL OF ITS UTILITY BUSINESSES AND INVESTED OVER  $1.1 BILLION  IN THOSE BUSINESSES IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI ANNOUNCED ITS SMART ENERGY PLAN, WHICH INCLUDES A FIVE-YEAR CAPITAL INVESTMENT OVERVIEW WITH A DETAILED ONE-YEAR PLAN FOR 2019. THE PLAN IS DESIGNED TO UPGRADE AMEREN MISSOURI'S ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND INCLUDES INVESTMENTS THAT WILL UPGRADE THE GRID AND ACCOMMODATE MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY. INVESTMENTS UNDER THE PLAN ARE EXPECTED TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $6.3 BILLION OVER THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD FROM 2019 THROUGH 2023, WITH COSTS LARGELY RECOVERABLE UNDER PISA AND, FOR THE PORTION OF WIND AND OTHER RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT RECOVERABLE UNDER PISA, RECOVERABLE UNDER THE RESRAM. AS A PART OF ITS SMART ENERGY PLAN, IN AUGUST 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS TO FILE FOR CERTIFICATES OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY WITH THE MOPSC TO BUILD THREE SOLAR FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF MISSOURI. EACH 10 MEGAWATT SOLAR ENERGY GENERATION FACILITY WILL CONNECT TO BATTERY STORAGE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE SYSTEM RELIABILITY. ALL THREE FACILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2020.  IN MARCH 2019, AMEREN ISSUED ITS BUILDING A CLEANER ENERGY FUTURE REPORT, WHICH SETS FORTH AMEREN'S PLAN FOR REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS AND ADDRESSING CLIMATE RISK. THE PLAN IS LARGELY REFLECTED IN THE AMEREN MISSOURI 2017 IRP, WHICH INCLUDES EXPANDING RENEWABLE SOURCES BY ADDING 700 MEGAWATTS OF WIND GENERATION BY THE END OF 2020 AND ADDING 100 MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR GENERATION BY 2027.  IN MAY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI ENTERED INTO A BUILD-TRANSFER AGREEMENT WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF ENEL GREEN POWER NORTH AMERICA, INC. TO ACQUIRE, AFTER CONSTRUCTION, AN UP-TO 300-MEGAWATT WIND GENERATION FACILITY TO BE LOCATED IN NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI. AMEREN MISSOURI FILED FOR A CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY WITH THE MOPSC IN MAY 2019.  IN JULY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI, THE MOPSC STAFF, AND CERTAIN INTERVENORS FILED A NONUNANIMOUS STIPULATION AND AGREEMENT WITH THE MOPSC REGARDING THE REQUESTED CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND  40  NECESSITY.  FINAL RTO INTERCONNECTION COSTS WERE DETERMINED IN JULY 2019, AND A RELATED RTO TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT IS EXPECTED BY THE FALL OF 2019.  IN 2018, AMEREN MISSOURI ENTERED INTO A BUILD-TRANSFER AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE, AFTER CONSTRUCTION, AN UP-TO  400  -MEGAWATT WIND GENERATION FACILITY.  FINAL MISO INTERCONNECTION COSTS FOR THE FACILITY WERE DETERMINED IN JULY 2019, AND A RELATED TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT WITH THE MISO IS EXPECTED BY THE FALL OF 2019.  BOTH FACILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2020, WHICH WOULD SUPPORT AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S COMPLIANCE WITH THE MISSOURI RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARD.  BOTH ACQUISITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF A CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY BY THE MOPSC AND OBTAINING FERC APPROVAL FOR THE 300-MEGAWATT FACILITY, ENTERING INTO AN RTO TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST FOR EACH FACILITY, AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  THE TWO BUILD-TRANSFER AGREEMENTS COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY  $1.2 BILLION  OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EXPECTED IN 2020.  THE MOPSC HAS APPROVED A RESRAM, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF REGULATORY LAG FOR THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARDS, INCLUDING RECOVERY OF INVESTMENTS IN WIND AND OTHER RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION, BY PROVIDING MORE TIMELY RECOVERY OF COSTS AND A RETURN ON INVESTMENTS NOT ALREADY PROVIDED FOR IN CUSTOMER RATES OR RECOVERED UNDER PISA.  SEE NOTE 2 \u2013 RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, OF THIS REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING AMEREN MISSOURI WIND GENERATION FACILITIES.  IN 2018, AMEREN MISSOURI ENTERED INTO A BUILD-TRANSFER AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE, AFTER CONSTRUCTION, A  157-  MEGAWATT WIND GENERATION FACILITY. IN JULY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI AND THE DEVELOPER MUTUALLY AGREED TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT DUE TO UNACCEPTABLE INTERCONNECTION COSTS, WHICH MADE THE PROJECT UNECONOMIC AND NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S CUSTOMERS.  IN DECEMBER 2018, AMEREN MISSOURI FILED A REQUEST WITH THE MOPSC TO INCREASE ITS ANNUAL REVENUES FOR NATURAL GAS DELIVERY SERVICE.  IN JULY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI, THE MOPSC STAFF, AND CERTAIN INTERVENORS FILED A NONUNANIMOUS STIPULATION AND AGREEMENT WITH THE MOPSC TO DECREASE AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ANNUAL REVENUES FOR NATURAL GAS DELIVERY SERVICE BY  $1 MILLION.  THE REMAINING INTERVENORS TO THE REGULATORY RATE REVIEW DID NOT OBJECT TO THE AGREEMENT.  THE REQUESTED DECREASE IN ANNUAL RATES IS BASED ON A RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY RANGE OF  9.4%  TO  9.95%  AND A CAPITAL STRUCTURE COMPOSED  OF  52.0%  COMMON EQUITY, WHICH WAS AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S CAPITAL STRUCTURE AS OF MAY 31, 2019. THIS AGREEMENT ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF ISRS, WHICH WILL BE CALCULATED USING AN ROE OF  9.725%.  THE AGREEMENT REPRESENTS A  $1 MILLION  INCREASE TO AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ANNUAL REVENUES FOR NATURAL GAS DELIVERY SERVICE FROM INTERIM RATES, WHICH WERE APPROVED BY THE MOPSC IN DECEMBER 2018.  A DECISION BY THE MOPSC IS EXPECTED IN AUGUST 2019, WITH NEW RATES EXPECTED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SEPTEMBER 2019.  IN JULY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI FILED A REQUEST WITH THE MOPSC SEEKING APPROVAL TO DECREASE ITS ANNUAL REVENUES FOR ELECTRIC SERVICE BY  $1 MILLION.  THE ELECTRIC RATE DECREASE REQUEST IS BASED ON A  9.95%  RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY, A CAPITAL STRUCTURE COMPOSED OF  51.9%  COMMON EQUITY, A RATE BASE OF  $8.0 BILLION  ,  AND A TEST YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WITH CERTAIN PRO-FORMA ADJUSTMENTS EXPECTED THROUGH AN ANTICIPATED TRUE-UP DATE OF DECEMBER 31, 2019. PRO-FORMA ADJUSTMENTS ARE ALSO EXPECTED FOR FUEL COSTS, TRANSPORTATION COSTS, MISO MULTI-VALUE TRANSMISSION PROJECT EXPENSES, AND PAYROLL COSTS EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2020.  THE MOPSC PROCEEDING RELATING TO THE PROPOSED ELECTRIC SERVICE RATE CHANGES WILL TAKE PLACE OVER A PERIOD OF UP TO  11  MONTHS, WITH A DECISION BY THE MOPSC EXPECTED BY LATE APRIL 2020 AND NEW RATES EFFECTIVE BY LATE MAY 2020.  SEE NOTE 2 \u2013 RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  IN APRIL 2019, AMEREN ILLINOIS FILED ITS ANNUAL ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE FORMULA RATE UPDATE TO ESTABLISH THE REVENUE REQUIREMENT TO BE USED FOR 2020 RATES WITH THE ICC. PENDING ICC APPROVAL, THIS UPDATE FILING WILL RESULT IN A  $7 MILLION  DECREASE IN AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE RATES, BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2020.  THIS UPDATE REFLECTS AN INCREASE TO THE ANNUAL FORMULA RATE BASED ON 2018 ACTUAL COSTS AND EXPECTED NET PLANT ADDITIONS FOR 2019, AND AN INCREASE TO INCLUDE THE 2018 REVENUE REQUIREMENT RECONCILIATION ADJUSTMENT. IT ALSO REFLECTS A DECREASE FOR THE CONCLUSION OF THE 2017 REVENUE REQUIREMENT RECONCILIATION ADJUSTMENT, WHICH WILL BE FULLY COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS IN 2019, CONSISTENT WITH THE ICC\u2019S NOVEMBER 2018 ANNUAL UPDATE FILING ORDER. IN JUNE 2019, THE ICC STAFF SUBMITTED ITS CALCULATION OF THE REVENUE REQUIREMENT INCLUDED IN AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 UPDATE FILING, RECOMMENDING AN AMOUNT COMPARABLE TO AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 FILING. AN ICC DECISION IN THIS PROCEEDING IS EXPECTED BY DECEMBER 2019.  ATXI CONTINUES TO MAKE PROGRESS WITH CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES FOR ITS TWO MISO-APPROVED MULTI-VALUE PROJECTS THAT ARE STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION: THE ILLINOIS RIVERS AND MARK TWAIN PROJECTS.  CONSTRUCTION OF THE ILLINOIS RIVERS PROJECT IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE, WITH THE LAST SECTION EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 2020, PENDING THE OUTCOME OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  IN JUNE 2019, A SECTION OF THE MARK TWAIN PROJECT WAS COMPLETED FROM KIRKSVILLE, MISSOURI TO THE IOWA BORDER, AND THE REMAINING SECTION IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2019.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION ARE AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ENERGY-EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS BY OUR CUSTOMERS AND BY US, AND THE ACTIONS OF KEY CUSTOMERS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES. AMEREN AND AMEREN MISSOURI RESULTS ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN WINTER HEATING AND SUMMER COOLING DEMANDS, AS WELL AS BY NUCLEAR REFUELING AND OTHER ENERGY CENTER MAINTENANCE OUTAGES. ADDITIONALLY, FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES AND CONDITIONS IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS AFFECT OUR COST OF BORROWING AND OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS COSTS. ALMOST ALL OF AMEREN\u2019S REVENUES ARE SUBJECT TO STATE OR FEDERAL REGULATION.  41  THIS REGULATION HAS A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE PRICES WE CHARGE FOR OUR SERVICES. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND LIQUIDITY ARE AFFECTED BY OUR ABILITY TO ALIGN OUR OVERALL SPENDING, BOTH OPERATING AND CAPITAL, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORKS ESTABLISHED BY OUR REGULATORS.  AMEREN MISSOURI PRINCIPALLY USES COAL AND ENRICHED URANIUM FOR FUEL IN ITS ELECTRIC OPERATIONS AND PURCHASES NATURAL GAS FOR ITS CUSTOMERS. AMEREN ILLINOIS PURCHASES POWER AND NATURAL GAS FOR ITS CUSTOMERS. THE PRICES FOR THESE COMMODITIES CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, WEATHER, SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND MANY OTHER FACTORS. AS DESCRIBED BELOW, WE HAVE NATURAL GAS COST RECOVERY MECHANISMS FOR OUR ILLINOIS AND MISSOURI NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES, A PURCHASED POWER COST RECOVERY MECHANISM FOR AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS, AND A FAC FOR AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ELECTRIC BUSINESS.  AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ELECTRIC SERVICE AND NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICE RATES ARE ESTABLISHED IN A TRADITIONAL REGULATORY RATE REVIEW BASED ON A HISTORICAL TEST YEAR AND AN ALLOWED RETURN ON EQUITY. TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF REGULATORY LAG, AMEREN MISSOURI HAS RECOVERY MECHANISMS IN PLACE FOR CERTAIN COSTS THAT ALLOW CUSTOMER RATES TO BE ADJUSTED WITHOUT A TRADITIONAL REGULATORY RATE REVIEW. AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S FAC COST RECOVERY MECHANISM ALLOWS IT TO RECOVER OR REFUND, THROUGH CUSTOMER RATES, 95% OF THE VARIANCE IN NET ENERGY COSTS FROM THE AMOUNT SET IN BASE RATES WITHOUT A TRADITIONAL REGULATORY RATE REVIEW, SUBJECT TO MOPSC PRUDENCE REVIEWS, WITH THE REMAINING 5% OF CHANGES RETAINED BY AMEREN MISSOURI. NET RECOVERY OF THESE COSTS THROUGH CUSTOMER RATES DOES NOT AFFECT AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ELECTRIC MARGINS, AS ANY CHANGE IN REVENUE IS OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN FUEL EXPENSE. IN ADDITION, AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S MEEIA CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAM COSTS, THE RELATED LOST ELECTRIC MARGINS, AND ANY PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE ARE RECOVERABLE THROUGH THE MEEIA COST RECOVERY MECHANISM WITHOUT A TRADITIONAL REGULATORY RATE REVIEW. AMEREN MISSOURI ALSO HAS A COST RECOVERY MECHANISM FOR NATURAL GAS PURCHASED ON BEHALF OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THESE PASS-THROUGH PURCHASED GAS COSTS DO NOT AFFECT AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S NATURAL GAS MARGINS, AS ANY CHANGE IN COSTS IS OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN REVENUES. AMEREN MISSOURI EMPLOYS OTHER COST RECOVERY MECHANISMS, INCLUDING A PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST TRACKER, AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION TRACKER, A TRACKER ON CERTAIN EXCESS DEFERRED TAXES, A RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARDS COST TRACKER, AND A SOLAR REBATE PROGRAM TRACKER. EACH OF THESE TRACKERS ALLOWS AMEREN MISSOURI TO DEFER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED AND COSTS INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER RATES AS A REGULATORY ASSET OR REGULATORY LIABILITY. THE DIFFERENCE WILL BE REFLECTED IN BASE RATES IN A SUBSEQUENT MOPSC RATE ORDER.  PURSUANT TO ITS PISA ELECTION, AMEREN MISSOURI IS PERMITTED TO DEFER AND RECOVER 85% OF THE DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL RETURN ON RATE BASE ON CERTAIN PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT PLACED IN SERVICE AFTER SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, AND NOT INCLUDED IN BASE RATES. ACCUMULATED PISA DEFERRALS EARN CARRYING COSTS AT THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, WITH ALL APPROVED PISA DEFERRALS ADDED TO RATE BASE PROSPECTIVELY AND RECOVERED OVER A PERIOD OF 20 YEARS FOLLOWING A REGULATORY RATE REVIEW. ADDITIONALLY, UNDER THE RESRAM, AMEREN MISSOURI IS PERMITTED TO RECOVER THE 15% OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL RETURN FOR RENEWABLE GENERATION PLANT PLACED IN SERVICE AND NOT RECOVERED UNDER PISA. ACCUMULATED RESRAM DEFERRALS EARN CARRYING COSTS AT SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES. PISA AND THE RESRAM MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF REGULATORY LAG BETWEEN REGULATORY RATE REVIEWS. THOSE INVESTMENTS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RECOVERY UNDER PISA AND THE REMAINING  15% OF CERTAIN PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT PLACED IN SERVICE, UNLESS ELIGIBLE FOR RECOVERY UNDER THE RESRAM, REMAIN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY LAG. AMEREN MISSOURI RECOGNIZES THE COST OF DEBT ON PISA DEFERRALS IN REVENUE, INSTEAD OF USING THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY, WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY BE RECOGNIZED IN REVENUES WHEN RECOVERY OF SUCH DEFERRALS ARE REFLECTED IN CUSTOMER RATES.  IN JANUARY 2019, THE MOOPC FILED AN APPEAL WITH THE MISSOURI COURT OF APPEALS, WESTERN DISTRICT, CHALLENGING THE MOPSC\u2019S DECEMBER 2018 ORDER ALLOWING AMEREN MISSOURI TO RECOVER, THROUGH THE RESRAM, THE 15% OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL RETURN NOT RECOVERED UNDER PISA FOR RENEWABLE GENERATION. SEE NOTE 2 \u2013 RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE RATES ARE RECONCILED ANNUALLY TO ITS ACTUAL REVENUE REQUIREMENT, YEAR-END RATE BASE AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE, AND ALLOWED RETURN ON EQUITY, UNDER A FORMULA RATEMAKING PROCESS, EFFECTIVE THROUGH 2022. IF A GIVEN YEAR\u2019S REVENUE REQUIREMENT VARIES FROM THE AMOUNT COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS, AN ADJUSTMENT IS MADE TO ELECTRIC OPERATING REVENUES WITH AN OFFSET TO A REGULATORY ASSET OR LIABILITY TO REFLECT THAT YEAR\u2019S ACTUAL REVENUE REQUIREMENT, INDEPENDENT OF ACTUAL SALES VOLUMES. THE REGULATORY BALANCE IS THEN COLLECTED FROM, OR REFUNDED TO, CUSTOMERS WITHIN TWO YEARS FROM THE END OF THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY RIDER PROVIDES AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE BUSINESS WITH RECOVERY OF, AND RETURN ON, ENERGY-EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS. UNDER FORMULA RATEMAKING FOR BOTH ITS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE AND ITS ELECTRIC ENERGY-EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS, THE REVENUE REQUIREMENTS ARE BASED ON RECOVERABLE COSTS, YEAR-END RATE BASE, A CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF 50% COMMON EQUITY, AND A RETURN ON EQUITY. THE RETURN ON EQUITY COMPONENT IS EQUAL TO THE ANNUAL AVERAGE OF THE MONTHLY YIELDS OF THE 30-YEAR UNITED STATES TREASURY BONDS PLUS 580 BASIS POINTS. THEREFORE, AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ANNUAL RETURN ON EQUITY FOR ITS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS IS DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO THE YIELDS ON SUCH BONDS.  AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICE RATES ARE ESTABLISHED IN A TRADITIONAL REGULATORY RATE REVIEW BASED ON A FUTURE TEST YEAR AND ALLOWED RETURN ON EQUITY. AMEREN ILLINOIS EMPLOYS A VBA TO ENSURE RECOVERABILITY OF THE NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICE REVENUE REQUIREMENT FOR RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL NONRESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS THAT IS DEPENDENT ON SALES VOLUMES. FOR THESE RATE CLASSES, THE VBA ALLOWS AMEREN ILLINOIS TO ADJUST NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICE RATES WITHOUT A TRADITIONAL REGULATORY RATE REVIEW WHEN CHANGES OCCUR IN SALES VOLUMES FROM NORMALIZED SALES VOLUMES APPROVED BY THE ICC IN A PREVIOUS REGULATORY RATE REVIEW. IN ADDITION, THE QIP RIDER PROVIDES AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 NATURAL GAS BUSINESS WITH RECOVERY OF, AND A RETURN ON, QUALIFYING INFRASTRUCTURE PLANT INVESTMENTS THAT ARE PLACED IN SERVICE BETWEEN REGULATORY RATE REVIEWS.  42  AMEREN ILLINOIS ALSO HAS RECOVERY MECHANISMS IN PLACE FOR CERTAIN COSTS THAT ALLOW CUSTOMER RATES TO BE ADJUSTED WITHOUT A TRADITIONAL REGULATORY RATE REVIEW. AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE BUSINESS HAS COST RECOVERY MECHANISMS FOR POWER PURCHASED AND TRANSMISSION SERVICES INCURRED ON BEHALF OF ITS CUSTOMERS, RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDIT COMPLIANCE, AND ZERO EMISSION CREDITS. AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 NATURAL GAS BUSINESS HAS A COST RECOVERY MECHANISM FOR NATURAL GAS PURCHASED ON BEHALF OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THESE PASS-THROUGH COSTS DO NOT AFFECT AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC OR NATURAL GAS MARGINS, AS ANY CHANGE IN COSTS IS OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN REVENUES. AMEREN ILLINOIS EMPLOYS OTHER COST RECOVERY MECHANISMS FOR NATURAL GAS CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAM COSTS AND CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS, AS WELL AS BAD DEBT EXPENSES AND COSTS OF CERTAIN ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS NOT RECOVERED IN BASE RATES.  FERC\u2019S ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION FORMULA RATE FRAMEWORK PROVIDES FOR AN ANNUAL RECONCILIATION OF THE ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SERVICE REVENUE REQUIREMENT, WHICH REFLECTS THE ACTUAL RECOVERABLE COSTS INCURRED AND THE 13-MONTH AVERAGE RATE BASE FOR A GIVEN YEAR, WITH THE REVENUE REQUIREMENT IN CUSTOMER RATES, INCLUDING AN ALLOWED RETURN ON EQUITY. AMEREN ILLINOIS AND ATXI USE A COMPANY-SPECIFIC, FORWARD-LOOKING FORMULA RATEMAKING FRAMEWORK IN SETTING THEIR TRANSMISSION RATES. THESE RATES ARE UPDATED EACH JANUARY WITH FORECASTED INFORMATION. IF A GIVEN YEAR\u2019S REVENUE REQUIREMENT VARIES FROM THE AMOUNT COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS, AN ADJUSTMENT IS MADE TO ELECTRIC OPERATING REVENUES WITH AN OFFSET TO A REGULATORY ASSET OR LIABILITY TO REFLECT THAT YEAR\u2019S ACTUAL REVENUE REQUIREMENT. THE REGULATORY BALANCE IS COLLECTED FROM, OR REFUNDED TO, CUSTOMERS WITHIN TWO YEARS FROM THE END OF THE YEAR. THE TOTAL RETURN ON EQUITY CURRENTLY ALLOWED FOR AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 AND ATXI\u2019S ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SERVICE BUSINESSES IS 10.82% AND IS SUBJECT TO A FERC COMPLAINT CASE. SEE NOTE 2 \u2013 RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  WE EMPLOY VARIOUS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY RISK AND OTHER RISKS INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESS. THE RELIABILITY OF AMEREN MISSOURI'S ENERGY CENTERS AND OUR TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS AND THE LEVEL AND TIMING OF OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS AND CAPITAL INVESTMENT ARE KEY FACTORS THAT WE SEEK TO MANAGE IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND LIQUIDITY.

AMEREN MISSOURI  AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ELECTRIC MARGINS DECREASED $93 MILLION  , OR  13%  , AND $111 MILLION  , OR  9%  , FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE  YEAR-AGO PERIODS.  THE FOLLOWING ITEMS HAD AN UNFAVORABLE EFFECT ON AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ELECTRIC MARGINS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIODS (EXCEPT WHEN A SPECIFIED PERIOD IS REFERENCED).  \u2022  EARLY SUMMER TEMPERATURES WERE MILDER AS COOLING DEGREE DAYS DECREASED 34% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD, AND WINTER TEMPERATURES WERE WARMER AS HEATING DEGREE DAYS DECREASED 4% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. THE AGGREGATE EFFECT OF WEATHER DECREASED MARGINS AN ESTIMATED $80 MILLION AND $78 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE CHANGE IN MARGINS DUE TO WEATHER IS THE SUM OF THE EFFECT OF WEATHER (ESTIMATE) ON ELECTRIC REVENUES (-  $95 MILLION  AND -  $92 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY) AND THE EFFECT OF WEATHER (ESTIMATE) ON FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER (+  $15 MILLION  AND +  $14 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY) IN THE TABLE ABOVE.  \u2022  THE REDUCTION OF CUSTOMER RATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TCJA PROVISIONS IN MISSOURI SENATE BILL 564 DECREASED REVENUES AN ESTIMATED  $2 MILLION  AND  $35 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  \u2022  A REDUCTION IN POWER RESTORATION ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO OTHER UTILITIES AND THE ASSOCIATED RECOVERY OF LABOR AND BENEFIT COSTS FOR CREWS SUPPORTING THOSE EFFORTS DECREASED REVENUES  $2 MILLION  AND  $11 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE FOLLOWING ITEMS HAD A FAVORABLE EFFECT ON AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ELECTRIC MARGINS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIODS (EXCEPT WHEN A SPECIFIED PERIOD IS REFERENCED).  \u2022  THE MEEIA 2013 AND MEEIA 2016 PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES INCREASED REVENUES  $15 MILLION  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. SEE NOTE 2 \u2013 RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE MEEIA 2013 AND MEEIA 2016 PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES.  \u2022  EXCLUDING THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF WEATHER AND THE MEEIA 2016 AND 2019 CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS, ELECTRIC REVENUES INCREASED AN ESTIMATED  $6 MILLION  AND  $13 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES VOLUMES FROM GROWTH AND AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE RETAIL PRICE PER KILOWATTHOUR DUE TO CHANGES IN CUSTOMER USAGE PATTERNS. WHILE MEEIA 2016 AND 2019 CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS REDUCED RETAIL SALES VOLUMES, THE RECOVERY OF LOST ELECTRIC MARGINS ENSURED THAT ELECTRIC MARGINS WERE NOT AFFECTED.  \u2022  NET ENERGY COSTS INCREASED MARGINS $1 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. THE CHANGE IN NET ENERGY COSTS IS THE SUM OF THE EFFECT OF REVENUE CHANGE IN OFF-SYSTEM SALES AND CAPACITY REVENUES (-  $32 MILLION  AND -  $51 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY), AND THE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE IN ENERGY COSTS (+  $32 MILLION  AND +  $52 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY) IN THE TABLE ABOVE.  AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S NATURAL GAS MARGINS WERE COMPARABLE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  AMEREN ILLINOIS  AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC MARGINS WERE COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  .

AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS\u2019 MARGINS INCREASED $23 MILLION  , OR  9%  , FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD.  AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION  AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION\u2019S MARGINS WERE COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018.  49  THE FOLLOWING ITEMS HAD A FAVORABLE EFFECT ON AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION\u2019S MARGINS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIODS (EXCEPT WHEN A SPECIFIED PERIOD IS REFERENCED).  \u2022  REVENUES INCREASED $3 MILLION  AND  $7 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAM INVESTMENTS PURSUANT TO THE FEJA.  \u2022  REVENUES INCREASED DUE TO THE RECOVERY OF HIGHER RECOVERABLE EXPENSES AND INCREASED RATE BASE UNDER FORMULA RATEMAKING PURSUANT TO THE IEIMA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER RECOGNIZED RETURN ON EQUITY, WHICH COLLECTIVELY INCREASED MARGINS  $4 MILLION  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION\u2019S MARGINS WERE UNFAVORABLY AFFECTED BY A REDUCTION IN POWER RESTORATION ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO OTHER UTILITIES AND THE ASSOCIATED RECOVERY OF LABOR AND BENEFIT COSTS FOR CREWS SUPPORTING THOSE EFFORTS, WHICH DECREASED REVENUES  $2 MILLION  AND  $9 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS  AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS\u2019 MARGINS WERE COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  .  AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS\u2019 MARGINS INCREASED $23 MILLION  , OR  9%  , FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD.  THE FOLLOWING ITEMS HAD A FAVORABLE EFFECT ON AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS\u2019 MARGINS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD.  \u2022  THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A CHANGE IN RATE DESIGN PURSUANT TO THE ICC\u2019S NOVEMBER 2018 NATURAL GAS ORDER INCREASED MARGINS BY  $9 MILLION  . THIS CHANGE IN RATE DESIGN CONCENTRATES MORE REVENUES IN THE WINTER HEATING SEASON DUE TO AN INCREASE IN VOLUMETRIC RATES AND A DECREASE IN FIXED CUSTOMER RATES. THE VBA ENSURES RECOVERABILITY OF THE NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICE REVENUE REQUIREMENT FOR RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL NONRESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS THAT IS DEPENDENT ON SALES VOLUMES. AS SUCH, THE CHANGE IS NOT EXPECTED TO MATERIALLY AFFECT YEAR-OVER-YEAR EARNINGS.  \u2022  REVENUES INCREASED  $8 MILLION  DUE TO HIGHER NATURAL GAS BASE RATES, AS A RESULT OF THE NOVEMBER 2018 NATURAL GAS RATE ORDER.  \u2022  REVENUES FROM QIP RECOVERIES, WHICH INCREASED MARGINS  $2 MILLION  , DUE TO ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN QUALIFIED NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE.  AMEREN ILLINOIS TRANSMISSION  AMEREN ILLINOIS TRANSMISSION\u2019S MARGINS INCREASED $4 MILLION  , OR  6%  , AND $12 MILLION  , OR  10%  , FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE  YEAR-AGO PERIODS  .

AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION  OTHER OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES WERE $3 MILLION  LOWER IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF  DECREASED BAD DEBT AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS.  OTHER OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES WERE $9 MILLION  LOWER IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD. LABOR AND BENEFIT COSTS DECREASED $8 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN POWER RESTORATION ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO OTHER UTILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, EXPENSES DECREASED BECAUSE OF A $4 MILLION INCREASE IN THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF COMPANY-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE AND A $3 MILLION REDUCTION IN BAD DEBT COSTS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $4 MILLION INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF REGULATORY ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FEJA ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAM.  AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS  OTHER OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES INCREASED $5 MILLION  AND $4 MILLION  IN THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH THE  YEAR-AGO PERIODS  , PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SYSTEM REPAIRS AND COMPLIANCE EXPENDITURES.

SEE NOTE 12 \u2013 INCOME TAXES UNDER PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT FOR A RECONCILIATION OF THE FEDERAL STATUTORY CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE TO THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE AMEREN COMPANIES. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  , AT AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS HIGHER AT AMEREN ILLINOIS TRANSMISSION AND AMEREN TRANSMISSION IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF DECREASED AMORTIZATION OF EXCESS DEFERRED TAXES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, ALONG WITH LOWER CURRENT YEAR TAX BENEFITS FROM CERTAIN DEPRECIATION DIFFERENCES ON PROPERTY-RELATED ITEMS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR EQUITY FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS LOWER AT AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF HIGHER NON-TAXABLE INCOME IN 2019. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  , AT EACH OF THE AMEREN ILLINOIS SEGMENTS AND AMEREN TRANSMISSION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  COLLECTIONS FROM OUR TARIFF-BASED REVENUES ARE OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. A DIVERSIFIED RETAIL CUSTOMER MIX, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF RATE-REGULATED RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL, AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS, PROVIDES US WITH A REASONABLY PREDICTABLE SOURCE OF CASH. IN ADDITION TO USING CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WE USE AVAILABLE CASH, BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS, COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES, AND/OR, IN THE CASE OF AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS, OTHER SHORT-TERM AFFILIATE BORROWINGS TO SUPPORT NORMAL OPERATIONS AND TEMPORARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. WE MAY REDUCE OUR SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS WITH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS OR, AT OUR DISCRETION, WITH LONG-TERM BORROWINGS OR, IN THE CASE OF AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS, WITH CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM AMEREN (PARENT). IN THE NEAR TERM, OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS WILL DECREASE DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN THE FEDERAL STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATE ENACTED UNDER THE TCJA. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS RESULTS FROM REDUCED CUSTOMER RATES, REFLECTING THE TAX RATE DECREASE, WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX PAYMENTS UNTIL ABOUT 2020 BECAUSE OF OUR USE OF NET OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. ADDITIONALLY, OPERATING CASH FLOWS WILL BE FURTHER REDUCED BY LOWER CUSTOMER RATES, RESULTING FROM THE RETURN OF EXCESS DEFERRED TAXES. OVER TIME, THE DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS WILL BE OFFSET AS TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOOK AND TAXABLE INCOME REVERSE, AND BY INCREASED CUSTOMER RATES DUE TO HIGHER RATE BASE AMOUNTS RESULTING FROM LOWER ACCUMULATED DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITIES. WE EXPECT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AS WE INVEST IN OUR ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OVERALL SYSTEM RELIABILITY, GRID MODERNIZATION, RENEWABLE ENERGY REQUIREMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS. AS PART OF ITS PLAN TO FUND THESE CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS, AMEREN IS USING NEWLY ISSUED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, RATHER THAN MARKET-PURCHASED SHARES, TO SATISFY REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE DRPLUS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO DO SO THROUGH AT LEAST 2023. AMEREN ALSO PLANS TO ISSUE INCREMENTAL COMMON EQUITY TO FUND A PORTION OF AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S WIND GENERATION INVESTMENTS. AMEREN, AMEREN MISSOURI, AND AMEREN ILLINOIS EXPECT THEIR RESPECTIVE EQUITY TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION LEVELS OVER THE PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 2023 TO REMAIN IN-LINE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE EQUITY TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION LEVELS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THE USE OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS AT THE AMEREN COMPANIES FREQUENTLY RESULTS IN A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT, DEFINED AS CURRENT LIABILITIES EXCEEDING CURRENT ASSETS, AS WAS THE CASE AT  JUNE 30, 2019  . THE WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND OUR DECISION TO FINANCE OUR BUSINESSES WITH LOWER-COST COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES. WITH THE CREDIT CAPACITY AVAILABLE UNDER THE CREDIT  52  AGREEMENTS, ALONG WITH CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, THE AMEREN COMPANIES HAD NET AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY OF  $1.1 BILLION  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  .

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO FUEL, PURCHASED POWER, AND NATURAL GAS PURCHASED FOR RESALE ARE RECOVERED FROM CUSTOMERS THROUGH RATE ADJUSTMENT MECHANISMS, WHICH MAY BE ADJUSTED WITHOUT A TRADITIONAL RATE PROCEEDING. SIMILAR REGULATORY MECHANISMS EXIST FOR CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES THAT CAN ALSO AFFECT THE TIMING OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE TIMING OF CASH PAYMENTS FOR COSTS RECOVERABLE UNDER OUR REGULATORY MECHANISMS DIFFERS FROM THE RECOVERY PERIOD OF THOSE COSTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE SEASONALITY OF OUR ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS BUSINESSES, PRIMARILY CAUSED BY CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEMAND DUE TO WEATHER, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF OUR CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

IN ADDITION TO THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE CHANGES AT AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS DISCUSSED BELOW, AMEREN\u2019S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCREASED DUE TO A $18 MILLION INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT ATXI. ATXI\u2019S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCREASED AS A RESULT OF INCREASED EXPENDITURES ON THE MARK TWAIN TRANSMISSION PROJECT OFFSET BY DECREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ON THE SPOON RIVER AND ILLINOIS RIVERS PROJECTS.  AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DECREASED  $22 MILLION  BETWEEN PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET MONEY POOL ADVANCES OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. IN  THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019  , AMEREN MISSOURI HAD NO MONEY POOL ADVANCES COMPARED WITH ADVANCES OF  $66 MILLION  IN THE  YEAR-AGO PERIOD  . ADDITIONALLY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCREASED  $41 MILLION  , PRIMARILY DUE TO SUBSTATION UPGRADES AND ENERGY DELIVERY INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES.

AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DECREASED  $41 MILLION  BETWEEN PERIODS PRIMARILY DUE TO  DECREASED  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF  $46 MILLION  RELATED TO ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SYSTEM RELIABILITY PROJECTS.

THE MISSOURI CREDIT AGREEMENT IS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT ISSUANCES UNDER AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. THE ILLINOIS CREDIT AGREEMENT IS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT ISSUANCES UNDER AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. ISSUANCES UNDER THE AMEREN (PARENT), AMEREN MISSOURI, AND AMEREN ILLINOIS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS WERE AVAILABLE AT LOWER INTEREST RATES THAN THE INTEREST RATES OF BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS. COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES WERE THUS PREFERRED TO CREDIT FACILITY BORROWINGS AS A SOURCE OF THIRD-PARTY SHORT-TERM DEBT.  IN ADDITION, AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS MAY BORROW CASH FROM THE UTILITY MONEY POOL WHEN FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE. THE RATE OF INTEREST DEPENDS ON THE COMPOSITION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNDS IN THE UTILITY MONEY POOL. AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS WILL ACCESS FUNDS FROM THE UTILITY MONEY POOL, THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS, OR THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS DEPENDING ON WHICH OPTION HAS THE LOWEST INTEREST RATES.  THE ISSUANCE OF SHORT-TERM DEBT SECURITIES BY AMEREN\u2019S UTILITY SUBSIDIARIES IS SUBJECT TO FERC APPROVAL UNDER THE FEDERAL POWER ACT.

AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE AMEREN COMPANIES WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS AND COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THEIR CREDIT AGREEMENTS, INDENTURES, AND ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION, AS APPLICABLE, AND ATXI WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS AND COVENANTS CONTAINED IN ITS NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT.  WE CONSIDER ACCESS TO SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL MARKETS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS NOT SATISFIED BY CASH PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES. INABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL ON REASONABLE TERMS, PARTICULARLY DURING TIMES OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES. AFTER ASSESSING ITS CURRENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE, LIQUIDITY, AND CREDIT RATINGS (SEE CREDIT RATINGS BELOW), AMEREN, AMEREN MISSOURI, AND AMEREN ILLINOIS EACH BELIEVES THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS. HOWEVER, EVENTS BEYOND AMEREN\u2019S, AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S, AND AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 CONTROL MAY CREATE UNCERTAINTY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR MAKE ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS UNCERTAIN OR LIMITED. SUCH EVENTS COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF CAPITAL AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS.  DIVIDENDS  THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF DIVIDENDS PAYABLE ON AMEREN\u2019S COMMON STOCK ARE WITHIN THE SOLE DISCRETION OF AMEREN\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AMEREN\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS NOT SET SPECIFIC TARGETS OR PAYOUT PARAMETERS WHEN DECLARING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, BUT IT CONSIDERS VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING AMEREN\u2019S OVERALL PAYOUT RATIO, PAYOUT RATIOS OF OUR PEERS, PROJECTED CASH FLOW AND POTENTIAL FUTURE CASH FLOW  56  REQUIREMENTS, HISTORICAL EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW, PROJECTED EARNINGS, IMPACTS OF REGULATORY ORDERS OR LEGISLATION, AND OTHER KEY BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS. AMEREN EXPECTS ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIO TO BE BETWEEN 55% AND 70% OF ANNUAL EARNINGS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

IT SHOULD BE EVALUATED INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY OTHER RATING. RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION OR WITHDRAWAL AT ANY TIME BY THE RATING ORGANIZATION.  57  COLLATERAL POSTINGS  ANY WEAKENING OF OUR CREDIT RATINGS MAY REDUCE ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL POSTINGS AND PREPAYMENTS. SUCH CHANGES MAY ALSO INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING, RESULTING IN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON EARNINGS. CASH COLLATERAL POSTINGS AND PREPAYMENTS MADE WITH EXTERNAL PARTIES, INCLUDING POSTINGS RELATED TO EXCHANGE-TRADED CONTRACTS, AND CASH COLLATERAL POSTED BY EXTERNAL PARTIES WERE IMMATERIAL AT  JUNE 30, 2019  . A SUB-INVESTMENT-GRADE ISSUER OR SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATING (BELOW \u201cBAA3\u201d FROM MOODY\u2019S OR BELOW \u201cBBB-\u201d FROM S&P) AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , COULD HAVE RESULTED IN AMEREN, AMEREN MISSOURI, OR AMEREN ILLINOIS BEING REQUIRED TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR OTHER ASSURANCES FOR CERTAIN TRADE OBLIGATIONS AMOUNTING TO $91 MILLION, $63 MILLION, AND $28 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES COULD TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL POSTINGS AND PREPAYMENTS. BASED ON CREDIT RATINGS AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , IF MARKET PRICES WERE 15% HIGHER OR LOWER THAN  JUNE 30, 2019  LEVELS IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND 20% HIGHER OR LOWER THEREAFTER THROUGH THE END OF THE TERM OF THE COMMODITY CONTRACTS, THEN AMEREN, AMEREN MISSOURI, OR AMEREN ILLINOIS COULD BE REQUIRED TO POST AN IMMATERIAL AMOUNT, COMPARED TO EACH COMPANY\u2019S LIQUIDITY, OF COLLATERAL OR OTHER ASSURANCES FOR CERTAIN TRADE OBLIGATIONS.  OUTLOOK  WE SEEK TO EARN COMPETITIVE RETURNS ON INVESTMENTS IN OUR BUSINESSES. WE SEEK TO IMPROVE OUR REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS AND COST RECOVERY MECHANISMS AND ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY PURSUING CONSTRUCTIVE REGULATORY OUTCOMES WITHIN EXISTING FRAMEWORKS, WHILE ALSO ADVOCATING FOR RESPONSIBLE ENERGY POLICIES. WE ALIGN OUR OVERALL SPENDING, BOTH OPERATING AND CAPITAL, WITH ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND WITH THE FRAMEWORKS ESTABLISHED BY OUR REGULATORS TO CREATE AND CAPITALIZE ON INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS. WE FOCUS ON MINIMIZING THE GAP BETWEEN ALLOWED AND EARNED RETURNS ON EQUITY AND ON ALLOCATING CAPITAL RESOURCES TO BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE EXPECT WILL OFFER THE MOST ATTRACTIVE RISK-ADJUSTED RETURN POTENTIAL.  AS PART OF AMEREN\u2019S STRATEGIC PLAN, WE PURSUE PROJECTS TO MEET OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 ENERGY NEEDS AND TO IMPROVE ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS SYSTEM RELIABILITY, SAFETY, AND SECURITY WITHIN OUR SERVICE TERRITORIES. AMEREN ALSO EVALUATES COMPETITIVE ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY ARISE. ADDITIONALLY, AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS TO TRANSITION TO A CLEANER, MORE DIVERSE ENERGY GENERATION PORTFOLIO OVER TIME BY MAKING INVESTMENTS IN RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND RETIRING ITS COAL-FIRED GENERATION AT THE END OF EACH ENERGY CENTER\u2019S USEFUL LIFE, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  BELOW ARE SOME KEY TRENDS, EVENTS, AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY REASONABLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR LIQUIDITY, AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES, FOR 2019 AND BEYOND.  OPERATIONS  \u2022  IN 2018, MISSOURI SENATE BILL 564 WAS ENACTED AND AMEREN MISSOURI ELECTED PISA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAW.  PURSUANT TO ITS PISA ELECTION, AMEREN MISSOURI IS PERMITTED TO DEFER AND RECOVER 85% OF THE DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL RETURN ON RATE BASE ON CERTAIN PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT PLACED IN SERVICE AFTER SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, AND NOT INCLUDED IN BASE RATES. ACCUMULATED PISA DEFERRALS EARN CARRYING COSTS AT THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, WITH ALL APPROVED PISA DEFERRALS ADDED TO RATE BASE PROSPECTIVELY AND RECOVERED OVER A PERIOD OF 20 YEARS FOLLOWING A REGULATORY RATE REVIEW. ADDITIONALLY, UNDER THE RESRAM, AMEREN MISSOURI IS PERMITTED TO RECOVER THE 15% OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL RETURN FOR RENEWABLE GENERATION PLANT PLACED IN SERVICE AND NOT RECOVERED UNDER PISA. ACCUMULATED RESRAM DEFERRALS EARN CARRYING COSTS AT SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES. PISA AND THE RESRAM MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF REGULATORY LAG BETWEEN REGULATORY RATE REVIEWS. THOSE INVESTMENTS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RECOVERY UNDER PISA AND THE REMAINING  15% OF CERTAIN PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT PLACED IN SERVICE, UNLESS ELIGIBLE FOR RECOVERY UNDER THE RESRAM, REMAIN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY LAG. AMEREN MISSOURI RECOGNIZES THE COST OF DEBT ON PISA DEFERRALS IN REVENUE, INSTEAD OF USING THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY, WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY BE RECOGNIZED IN REVENUES WHEN RECOVERY OF SUCH DEFERRALS ARE REFLECTED IN CUSTOMER RATES.  AS A RESULT OF THE PISA ELECTION, ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS OF THE LAW APPLY TO AMEREN MISSOURI, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON ELECTRIC CUSTOMER RATE INCREASES AND AN ELECTRIC BASE RATE FREEZE UNTIL APRIL 2020. BOTH THE RATE INCREASE LIMITATION AND PISA ARE EFFECTIVE THROUGH DECEMBER 2023, UNLESS AMEREN MISSOURI REQUESTS AND RECEIVES MOPSC APPROVAL OF AN EXTENSION THROUGH DECEMBER 2028.  IN JANUARY 2019, THE MOOPC FILED AN APPEAL WITH THE MISSOURI COURT OF APPEALS, WESTERN DISTRICT, CHALLENGING THE MOPSC\u2019S DECEMBER 2018 ORDER ALLOWING AMEREN MISSOURI TO RECOVER, THROUGH THE RESRAM, THE  15%  OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL RETURN NOT RECOVERED UNDER PISA. AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS A DECISION BY THE END OF 2019. THE RESRAM IS DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF REGULATORY LAG FOR THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARDS, INCLUDING RECOVERY OF INVESTMENTS IN WIND AND OTHER RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION, BY PROVIDING MORE TIMELY RECOVERY OF COSTS AND A RETURN ON INVESTMENTS NOT ALREADY PROVIDED FOR IN CUSTOMER RATES OR RECOVERED UNDER PISA.  \u2022  IN FEBRUARY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI ANNOUNCED ITS SMART ENERGY PLAN, WHICH INCLUDES A FIVE-YEAR CAPITAL INVESTMENT OVERVIEW WITH A DETAILED ONE-YEAR PLAN FOR 2019. THE PLAN IS DESIGNED TO UPGRADE AMEREN MISSOURI'S ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND INCLUDES INVESTMENTS THAT WILL UPGRADE THE GRID AND ACCOMMODATE MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY. INVESTMENTS UNDER THE PLAN ARE EXPECTED TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $6.3 BILLION OVER THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD FROM 2019 THROUGH 2023, WITH COSTS LARGELY RECOVERABLE UNDER PISA AND, FOR THE PORTION OF WIND AND OTHER RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT RECOVERABLE UNDER PISA, RECOVERABLE UNDER THE RESRAM. AS A PART OF ITS SMART  58  ENERGY PLAN, IN AUGUST 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS TO FILE FOR CERTIFICATES OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY WITH THE MOPSC TO BUILD THREE SOLAR FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF MISSOURI. EACH 10 MEGAWATT SOLAR ENERGY GENERATION FACILITY WILL CONNECT TO BATTERY STORAGE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE SYSTEM RELIABILITY. ALL THREE FACILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2020.  \u2022  IN 2018, THE MOPSC ISSUED AN ORDER APPROVING AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S MEEIA 2019 PLAN. THE PLAN INCLUDES A PORTFOLIO OF CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS THROUGH DECEMBER 2021 AND LOW-INCOME CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS THROUGH DECEMBER 2024, ALONG WITH A REGULATORY RECOVERY MECHANISM. AMEREN MISSOURI INTENDS TO INVEST $226 MILLION OVER THE LIFE OF THE PLAN, INCLUDING $65 MILLION PER YEAR THROUGH 2021. THE PLAN INCLUDES THE CONTINUED USE OF THE MEEIA RIDER, WHICH ALLOWS AMEREN MISSOURI TO COLLECT FROM, OR REFUND TO, CUSTOMERS ANY DIFFERENCE IN ACTUAL MEEIA PROGRAM COSTS AND RELATED LOST ELECTRIC MARGINS AND THE AMOUNTS COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, THE PLAN INCLUDES A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE THAT PROVIDES AMEREN MISSOURI AN OPPORTUNITY TO EARN ADDITIONAL REVENUES BY ACHIEVING CERTAIN CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY GOALS, INCLUDING $7 MILLION, $10 MILLION, AND $13 MILLION IF 100% OF THE GOALS ARE ACHIEVED DURING 2019, 2020, AND 2021, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONAL REVENUES MAY BE EARNED IF AMEREN MISSOURI EXCEEDS 100% OF ITS ENERGY SAVINGS GOALS. BY THE END OF 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS AN ORDER FROM THE MOPSC APPROVING AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ENERGY SAVINGS RESULTS FOR THE THIRD PLAN YEAR OF THE MEEIA 2016 PROGRAMS.  \u2022  IN JUNE 2018, THE MOPSC APPROVED AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S RENEWABLE CHOICE PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS LARGE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS AND MUNICIPALITIES TO ELECT TO RECEIVE UP TO 100% OF THEIR ENERGY FROM RENEWABLE RESOURCES. THE TARIFF-BASED PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO RECOVER THE COSTS OF THE ELECTION, NET OF CHANGES IN THE MARKET PRICE OF SUCH ENERGY. BASED ON CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, THE PROGRAM ENABLES AMEREN MISSOURI TO SUPPLY UP TO 400 MEGAWATTS OF RENEWABLE WIND ENERGY GENERATION, UP TO 200 MEGAWATTS OF WHICH IT COULD OWN. AS APPLICABLE, THE ADDITION OF GENERATION BY AMEREN MISSOURI WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE ISSUANCE OF A CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY BY THE MOPSC, OBTAINING TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS WITH MISO OR OTHER RTOS, AND FERC APPROVAL. ANY OWNED GENERATION UNDER THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE INCREMENTAL TO ESTIMATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES THROUGH 2023 DISCUSSED BELOW. AMEREN MISSOURI ANTICIPATES FINALIZING CUSTOMER INTEREST AND PURSUING RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS TO FULFILL REQUIREMENTS IN 2019. WITHOUT EXTENSION, THE OPTION TO ELECT INTO THE PROGRAM WILL TERMINATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2023.  \u2022  IN JULY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI FILED A REQUEST WITH THE MOPSC SEEKING APPROVAL TO DECREASE ITS ANNUAL REVENUES FOR ELECTRIC SERVICE BY  $1 MILLION.  THE ELECTRIC RATE DECREASE REQUEST IS BASED ON A  9.95%  RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY, A CAPITAL STRUCTURE COMPOSED OF  51.9%  COMMON EQUITY, A RATE BASE OF  $8.0 BILLION  ,  AND A TEST YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WITH CERTAIN PRO-FORMA ADJUSTMENTS EXPECTED THROUGH AN ANTICIPATED TRUE-UP DATE OF DECEMBER 31, 2019. PRO-FORMA ADJUSTMENTS ARE ALSO EXPECTED FOR FUEL COSTS, TRANSPORTATION COSTS, MISO MULTI-VALUE TRANSMISSION PROJECT EXPENSES, AND PAYROLL COSTS EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2020.  THE MOPSC PROCEEDING RELATING TO THE PROPOSED ELECTRIC SERVICE RATE CHANGES WILL TAKE PLACE OVER A PERIOD OF UP TO  11  MONTHS, WITH A DECISION BY THE MOPSC EXPECTED BY LATE APRIL 2020 AND NEW RATES EFFECTIVE BY LATE MAY 2020.  A 50 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY WOULD RESULT IN AN ESTIMATED $20 MILLION CHANGE IN AMEREN\u2019S AND AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S NET INCOME, BASED ON AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S CURRENT ELECTRIC RATE BASE.  \u2022  IN JULY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI, THE MOPSC STAFF, AND CERTAIN INTERVENORS FILED A NONUNANIMOUS STIPULATION AND AGREEMENT WITH THE MOPSC TO DECREASE AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ANNUAL REVENUES FOR NATURAL GAS DELIVERY SERVICE BY  $1 MILLION.  THE REMAINING INTERVENORS TO THE REGULATORY RATE REVIEW DID NOT OBJECT TO THE AGREEMENT.  THE REQUESTED DECREASE IN ANNUAL RATES IS BASED ON A RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY RANGE OF  9.4%  TO  9.95%  AND A CAPITAL STRUCTURE COMPOSED  OF  52.0%  COMMON EQUITY, WHICH WAS AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S CAPITAL STRUCTURE AS OF MAY 31, 2019. THIS AGREEMENT ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF ISRS, WHICH WILL BE CALCULATED USING AN ROE OF  9.725%.  THE AGREEMENT REPRESENTS A  $1 MILLION  INCREASE TO AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ANNUAL REVENUES FOR NATURAL GAS DELIVERY SERVICE FROM INTERIM RATES, WHICH WERE APPROVED BY THE MOPSC IN DECEMBER 2018.  A DECISION BY THE MOPSC IS EXPECTED IN AUGUST 2019, WITH NEW RATES EXPECTED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SEPTEMBER 2019.  \u2022  AMEREN CONTINUES TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN FERC-REGULATED ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION BUSINESSES. AMEREN ILLINOIS EXPECTS TO INVEST $2.2 BILLION IN ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION ASSETS FROM 2019 THROUGH 2023, TO REPLACE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND IMPROVE RELIABILITY. ATXI HAS THREE MISO-APPROVED MULTI-VALUE PROJECTS: THE SPOON RIVER, ILLINOIS RIVERS, AND MARK TWAIN PROJECTS. THE SPOON RIVER PROJECT, LOCATED IN NORTHWEST ILLINOIS, WAS PLACED IN SERVICE IN FEBRUARY 2018. THE ILLINOIS RIVERS PROJECT INVOLVES THE CONSTRUCTION OF A TRANSMISSION LINE FROM EASTERN MISSOURI ACROSS ILLINOIS TO WESTERN INDIANA.  CONSTRUCTION OF THE ILLINOIS RIVERS PROJECT IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE, WITH THE LAST SECTION EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 2020, PENDING THE OUTCOME OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  THE MARK TWAIN PROJECT INVOLVES THE CONSTRUCTION OF A TRANSMISSION LINE FROM NORTHEAST MISSOURI, CONNECTING THE ILLINOIS RIVERS PROJECT TO IOWA.  IN JUNE 2019, A SECTION OF THE MARK TWAIN PROJECT WAS COMPLETED FROM KIRKSVILLE, MISSOURI TO THE IOWA BORDER. CONSTRUCTION OF THE MARK TWAIN PROJECT BEGAN IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, WITH THE REMAINING SECTION EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2019. ATXI\u2019S EXPECTED INVESTMENT IN 2019 AND 2020 TO COMPLETE ITS MULTI-VALUE PROJECTS IS APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION, WITH THE TOTAL INVESTMENT EXPECTED TO BE MORE THAN $1.6 BILLION.  \u2022  AMEREN ILLINOIS AND ATXI USE A FORWARD-LOOKING RATE CALCULATION WITH AN ANNUAL REVENUE REQUIREMENT RECONCILIATION FOR EACH COMPANY\u2019S ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION BUSINESS. BASED ON EXPECTED RATE BASE GROWTH AND THE CURRENTLY ALLOWED 10.82% RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY, THE 2019 REVENUE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDED IN RATES FOR AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 AND ATXI\u2019S ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION BUSINESSES ARE $297 MILLION AND $177  59  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE REVENUE REQUIREMENTS REPRESENT AN INCREASE IN AMEREN ILLINOIS' AND ATXI\u2019S REVENUE REQUIREMENTS OF $24 MILLION AND $3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXPECTED RATE BASE GROWTH. THESE RATES WILL AFFECT AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 AND ATXI\u2019S CASH RECEIPTS DURING 2019, BUT WILL NOT DETERMINE THEIR RESPECTIVE ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SERVICE OPERATING REVENUES, WHICH WILL INSTEAD BE BASED ON 2019 ACTUAL RECOVERABLE COSTS, RATE BASE, AND RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY AS CALCULATED UNDER THE FERC FORMULA RATEMAKING FRAMEWORK.  \u2022  THE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY FOR MISO TRANSMISSION OWNERS, INCLUDING AMEREN ILLINOIS AND ATXI, IS THE SUBJECT OF A FERC COMPLAINT CASE FILED IN FEBRUARY 2015 CHALLENGING THE ALLOWED BASE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY. AMEREN ILLINOIS AND ATXI CURRENTLY USE THE FERC AUTHORIZED TOTAL ALLOWED RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY OF 10.82% IN CUSTOMER RATES. A FINAL FERC ORDER WOULD ESTABLISH THE ALLOWED RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY TO BE APPLIED TO THE 15-MONTH PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 2015 TO MAY 2016 AND ALSO ESTABLISH THE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY TO BE INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER RATES PROSPECTIVELY FROM THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SUCH ORDER, REPLACING THE CURRENT 10.82% TOTAL RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY.  IN OCTOBER 2018, THE FERC ISSUED AN ORDER IN AN UNRELATED CASE THAT PROPOSED A NEW METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE BASE RETURN ON EQUITY, WHICH REQUIRED FURTHER BRIEFS FROM THE PARTICIPANTS. IN NOVEMBER 2018, THE FERC ISSUED AN ORDER RELATED TO THE FEBRUARY 2015 COMPLAINT CASE AND THE SEPTEMBER 2016 ORDER, WHICH REQUIRED PARTICIPANTS TO FILE BRIEFS IN FEBRUARY 2019 REGARDING THE FERC\u2019S PROPOSED METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE BASE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY, INCLUDING WHETHER AND HOW TO APPLY THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY TO THE TWO MISO COMPLAINT CASES. IN MARCH 2019, THE FERC ISSUED SEPARATE NOTICES OF INQUIRY REGARDING ITS ALLOWED BASE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY POLICY AND ITS TRANSMISSION INCENTIVES POLICY. INITIAL COMMENTS WERE DUE IN JUNE 2019, AND REPLY COMMENTS ARE DUE BY LATE AUGUST 2019. THE NOTICE OF INQUIRY ADDRESSING THE FERC\u2019S RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY POLICY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BROADENS THE ABILITY TO COMMENT ON THE NEW METHODOLOGY BEYOND ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT ARE PARTICIPANTS IN THE COMPLAINT CASES, AND THE TRANSMISSION INCENTIVES NOTICE OF INQUIRY IS OPEN FOR INDUSTRY COMMENT ON THE FERC\u2019S TRANSMISSION INCENTIVE POLICY, INCLUDING INCENTIVE ADDERS TO THE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY. AMEREN IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY ON THESE COMPLAINT CASES OR THE NOTICES OF INQUIRY AT THIS TIME.  AS THE FERC IS UNDER NO DEADLINE TO ISSUE A FINAL ORDER, THE TIMING OF THE FINAL ORDER IN THE FEBRUARY 2015 COMPLAINT CASE AND ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT TO THE AMOUNTS REFUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE SEPTEMBER 2016 ORDER IS UNCERTAIN.  SEE NOTE 2 \u2013 RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, OF THIS REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING FERC COMPLAINT CASES. A 50 BASIS POINT REDUCTION IN THE FERC-ALLOWED BASE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY WOULD REDUCE AMEREN\u2019S AND AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 NET INCOME BY AN ESTIMATED $9 MILLION AND $5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, BASED ON EACH COMPANY\u2019S 2019 PROJECTED RATE BASE.  \u2022  IN 2018, THE ICC ISSUED AN ORDER IN AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ANNUAL UPDATE FILING THAT APPROVED A $72 MILLION INCREASE IN AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE RATES BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2019. ILLINOIS LAW PROVIDES FOR AN ANNUAL RECONCILIATION OF THE ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION REVENUE REQUIREMENT AS IS NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED AND INVESTMENT RETURN IN A GIVEN YEAR WITH THE REVENUE REQUIREMENT THAT WAS REFLECTED IN CUSTOMER RATES FOR THAT YEAR. CONSEQUENTLY, AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE REVENUES WILL BE BASED ON ITS 2019 ACTUAL RECOVERABLE COSTS, RATE BASE, AND RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY AS CALCULATED UNDER THE ILLINOIS PERFORMANCE-BASED FORMULA RATEMAKING FRAMEWORK. THE 2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE REVENUES ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER THAN THE 2018 REVENUES BECAUSE OF AN EXPECTED INCREASE IN RECOVERABLE COSTS AND EXPECTED RATE BASE GROWTH OF APPROXIMATELY 8%. THE 2019 REVENUE REQUIREMENT RECONCILIATION IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A REGULATORY ASSET THAT WILL BE COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS IN 2021. A 50 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN THE ANNUAL AVERAGE OF THE MONTHLY YIELDS OF THE 30-YEAR UNITED STATES TREASURY BONDS WOULD RESULT IN AN ESTIMATED $8 MILLION CHANGE IN AMEREN\u2019S AND AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 NET INCOME, BASED ON AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 2019 PROJECTED YEAR-END RATE BASE.  \u2022  IN APRIL 2019, AMEREN ILLINOIS FILED ITS ANNUAL ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE FORMULA RATE UPDATE TO ESTABLISH THE REVENUE REQUIREMENT TO BE USED FOR 2020 RATES WITH THE ICC. PENDING ICC APPROVAL, THIS UPDATE FILING WILL RESULT IN A  $7 MILLION  DECREASE IN AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE RATES, BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2020.  THESE RATES WILL AFFECT AMEREN ILLINOIS' CASH RECEIPTS DURING 2020, BUT WILL NOT AFFECT ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE REVENUES, WHICH WILL BE BASED ON ACTUAL RECOVERABLE COSTS, RATE BASE, AND RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY AS CALCULATED UNDER THE ILLINOIS PERFORMANCE-BASED FORMULA RATEMAKING FRAMEWORK.  \u2022  AMEREN ILLINOIS IS ALLOWED TO EARN A RETURN ON ITS ELECTRIC ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAM INVESTMENTS. AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC ENERGY-EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS ARE DEFERRED AS A REGULATORY ASSET AND EARN A RETURN AT ITS WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, WITH THE EQUITY RETURN BASED ON THE ANNUAL AVERAGE OF THE MONTHLY YIELDS OF THE 30-YEAR UNITED STATES TREASURY BONDS PLUS 580 BASIS POINTS. THE EQUITY PORTION OF AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 RETURN ON ELECTRIC ENERGY-EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS CAN BE INCREASED OR DECREASED BY UP TO 200 BASIS POINTS, DEPENDING ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ANNUAL ENERGY SAVINGS GOALS. PURSUANT TO THE FEJA, AMEREN ILLINOIS PLANS TO INVEST UP TO APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION PER YEAR IN ELECTRIC ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS THROUGH 2023 AND WILL EARN A RETURN ON THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE ICC HAS THE ABILITY TO REDUCE ELECTRIC ENERGY-EFFICIENCY SAVINGS GOALS IF THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT COST-EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE OR IF THE SAVINGS GOALS WOULD REQUIRE INVESTMENT LEVELS THAT EXCEED AMOUNTS ALLOWED BY LEGISLATION. THE ELECTRIC ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAM INVESTMENTS AND THE RETURN ON THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS THROUGH A RIDER AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION FORMULA RATEMAKING FRAMEWORK.  \u2022  AMEREN MISSOURI'S NEXT REFUELING AND MAINTENANCE OUTAGE AT ITS CALLAWAY ENERGY CENTER IS SCHEDULED FOR THE FALL OF 2020. DURING A SCHEDULED OUTAGE, WHICH OCCURS EVERY 18 MONTHS, MAINTENANCE EXPENSES INCREASE RELATIVE TO NON-OUTAGE YEARS. ADDITIONALLY, DEPENDING ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ITS OTHER GENERATION SOURCES AND THE MARKET PRICES FOR POWER, AMEREN MISSOURI'S PURCHASED POWER COSTS MAY  60  INCREASE AND THE AMOUNT OF EXCESS POWER AVAILABLE FOR SALE MAY DECREASE VERSUS NON-OUTAGE YEARS. CHANGES IN PURCHASED POWER COSTS AND EXCESS POWER AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE INCLUDED IN THE FAC, WHICH RESULTS IN LIMITED IMPACTS TO EARNINGS.  \u2022  AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS CONTINUE TO MAKE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND EXPECT TO SEEK REGULAR ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS RATE INCREASES TO RECOVER THE COST OF INVESTMENTS AND EARN AN ADEQUATE RETURN. AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS WILL ALSO SEEK LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS, AS NECESSARY, TO ADDRESS REGULATORY LAG AND TO SUPPORT INVESTMENT IN THEIR UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR CUSTOMERS. AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS CONTINUE TO FACE COST RECOVERY PRESSURES, INCLUDING LIMITED ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THEIR SERVICE TERRITORIES, CUSTOMER CONSERVATION EFFORTS, THE IMPACTS OF ADDITIONAL CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS, AND INCREASED CUSTOMER USE OF INCREASINGLY COST-EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, INCLUDING PRIVATE GENERATION AND ENERGY STORAGE. HOWEVER, OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE EXPECT THE DECREASED DEMAND TO BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED DEMAND RESULTING FROM INCREASED ELECTRIFICATION OF THE ECONOMY FOR EFFICIENCIES AND AS A MEANS TO ADDRESS CO  2  EMISSION CONCERNS. INCREASED INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING EXPECTED FUTURE INVESTMENTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, SYSTEM RELIABILITY IMPROVEMENTS, AND POTENTIAL NEW GENERATION SOURCES, RESULT IN RATE BASE AND REVENUE GROWTH BUT ALSO HIGHER DEPRECIATION AND FINANCING COSTS.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING RECENT RATE ORDERS, LAWSUITS, AND PENDING REQUESTS FILED WITH STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORY COMMISSIONS, SEE NOTE 2 \u2013 RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, OF THIS REPORT AND NOTE 2 \u2013 RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS UNDER PART II, ITEM 8, OF THE FORM 10-K.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  \u2022  AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S 2017 IRP TARGETS CLEANER AND MORE DIVERSE SOURCES OF ENERGY GENERATION, INCLUDING SOLAR, WIND, NATURAL GAS, HYDRO, AND NUCLEAR POWER. IT ALSO INCLUDES EXPANDING RENEWABLE SOURCES BY ADDING AT LEAST 700 MEGAWATTS OF WIND GENERATION BY THE END OF 2020 IN MISSOURI AND NEIGHBORING STATES AND ADDING 100 MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR GENERATION BY 2027. THESE NEW RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES WOULD SUPPORT AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE OF MISSOURI\u2019S REQUIREMENT OF ACHIEVING 15% OF NATIVE LOAD SALES FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES BY 2021, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMER RATE INCREASE LIMITATIONS. BASED ON CURRENT AND PROJECTED MARKET PRICES FOR ENERGY AND FOR WIND AND SOLAR GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS ITS OWNERSHIP OF THESE RENEWABLE RESOURCES WOULD REPRESENT THE LOWEST-COST OPTION FOR CUSTOMERS. THE PLAN ALSO PROVIDES FOR THE EXPECTED IMPLEMENTATION OF CONTINUED CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS. AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S PLAN FOR THE ADDITION OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES COULD BE AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS: THE AVAILABILITY OF FEDERAL PRODUCTION AND INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS RELATED TO RENEWABLE ENERGY AND AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ABILITY TO USE SUCH CREDITS; THE COST OF WIND AND SOLAR GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES; ENERGY PRICES; AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ABILITY TO OBTAIN TIMELY INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS WITH MISO OR OTHER RTOS AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST; AND AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ABILITY TO OBTAIN A CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY FROM THE MOPSC, AND ANY OTHER REQUIRED PROJECT APPROVALS.  \u2022  IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2017 IRP FILING, AMEREN MISSOURI ESTABLISHED A GOAL OF REDUCING CO  2  EMISSIONS 80% BY 2050 FROM A 2005 BASE LEVEL. AMEREN MISSOURI IS ALSO TARGETING A 35% CO  2  EMISSION REDUCTION BY 2030 AND A 50% REDUCTION BY 2040 FROM THE 2005 LEVEL. IN ORDER TO MEET THESE GOALS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS TO RETIRE ITS COAL-FIRED GENERATION AT THE END OF EACH ENERGY CENTER\u2019S USEFUL LIFE.  \u2022  IN MAY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI ENTERED INTO A BUILD-TRANSFER AGREEMENT WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF ENEL GREEN POWER NORTH AMERICA, INC. TO ACQUIRE, AFTER CONSTRUCTION, AN UP-TO 300-MEGAWATT WIND GENERATION FACILITY TO BE LOCATED IN NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI. AMEREN MISSOURI FILED FOR A CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY WITH THE MOPSC IN MAY 2019.  IN JULY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI, THE MOPSC STAFF, AND CERTAIN INTERVENORS FILED A NONUNANIMOUS STIPULATION AND AGREEMENT WITH THE MOPSC REGARDING THE REQUESTED CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY.  FINAL RTO INTERCONNECTION COSTS WERE DETERMINED IN JULY 2019, AND A RELATED RTO TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT IS EXPECTED BY THE FALL OF 2019.  \u2022  IN 2018, AMEREN MISSOURI ENTERED INTO A BUILD-TRANSFER AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE, AFTER CONSTRUCTION, AN UP-TO  400  -MEGAWATT WIND GENERATION FACILITY.  FINAL MISO INTERCONNECTION COSTS FOR THE FACILITY WERE DETERMINED IN JULY 2019, AND A RELATED TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT WITH THE MISO IS EXPECTED BY THE FALL OF 2019.  \u2022  BOTH FACILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2020, WHICH WOULD SUPPORT AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S COMPLIANCE WITH THE MISSOURI RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARD.  BOTH ACQUISITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF A CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY BY THE MOPSC AND OBTAINING FERC APPROVAL FOR THE 300-MEGAWATT FACILITY, ENTERING INTO AN RTO TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST FOR EACH FACILITY, AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  THE TWO BUILD-TRANSFER AGREEMENTS COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY  $1.2 BILLION  OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EXPECTED IN 2020.  THE MOPSC HAS APPROVED A RESRAM, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF REGULATORY LAG FOR THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARDS, INCLUDING RECOVERY OF INVESTMENTS IN WIND AND OTHER RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION, BY PROVIDING MORE TIMELY RECOVERY OF COSTS AND A RETURN ON INVESTMENTS NOT ALREADY PROVIDED FOR IN CUSTOMER RATES OR RECOVERED UNDER PISA.  \u2022  THROUGH 2023, WE EXPECT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO IMPROVE OUR ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE, WITH A MAJOR PORTION DIRECTED TO OUR TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL INVEST UP TO $13.9 BILLION (AMEREN  61  MISSOURI \u2013 UP TO $7.1 BILLION; AMEREN ILLINOIS \u2013 UP TO $6.6 BILLION; ATXI \u2013 UP TO $0.2 BILLION) OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE PERIOD FROM 2019 THROUGH 2023. AMEREN\u2019S AND AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ESTIMATES INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION IN 2020 FOR CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN WIND GENERATION FACILITIES.  \u2022  ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO CO  2  EMISSIONS, OR OTHER ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE EPA, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING COSTS. CERTAIN OF THESE REGULATIONS ARE BEING CHALLENGED THROUGH LITIGATION, OR REVIEWED OR RECOMMENDED FOR REPEAL BY THE EPA, OR NEW REPLACEMENT OR ALTERNATIVE REGULATIONS ARE BEING CONTEMPLATED, PROPOSED, OR ADOPTED BY THE EPA AND STATE REGULATORS. THE ULTIMATE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY OF THESE REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS THE TIMING OF ANY SUCH IMPLEMENTATION, IS UNCERTAIN. HOWEVER, THE INDIVIDUAL OR COMBINED EFFECTS OF EXISTING AND NEW ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCREASED OPERATING COSTS, OR THE CLOSURE OR ALTERATION OF SOME OF AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S COAL-FIRED ENERGY CENTERS. AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE SUBJECT TO MOPSC PRUDENCE REVIEWS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN COST DISALLOWANCES AS WELL AS REGULATORY LAG. THE COST OF AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 PURCHASED POWER AND NATURAL GAS PURCHASED FOR RESALE COULD INCREASE. HOWEVER, AMEREN ILLINOIS EXPECTS THAT THESE COSTS WOULD BE RECOVERED FROM CUSTOMERS WITH NO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, OR LIQUIDITY. AMEREN\u2019S AND AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S EARNINGS COULD BENEFIT FROM INCREASED INVESTMENT TO COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS IF THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE REFLECTED AND RECOVERED ON A TIMELY BASIS IN CUSTOMER RATES.  \u2022  THE AMEREN COMPANIES HAVE MULTIYEAR CREDIT AGREEMENTS THAT CUMULATIVELY PROVIDE $2.1 BILLION OF CREDIT THROUGH DECEMBER 2022, SUBJECT TO A 364-DAY REPAYMENT TERM FOR AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS, WITH THE OPTION TO SEEK INCREMENTAL COMMITMENTS TO INCREASE THE CUMULATIVE CREDIT PROVIDED TO $2.5 BILLION. SEE NOTE 3 \u2013 SHORT-TERM DEBT AND LIQUIDITY UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS. AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS TO ISSUE LONG-TERM DEBT TO REPAY $244 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR SECURED NOTES SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN OCTOBER 2019. AMEREN ILLINOIS EXPECTS TO ISSUE LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. AMEREN, AMEREN MISSOURI, AND AMEREN ILLINOIS BELIEVE THAT THEIR LIQUIDITY IS ADEQUATE GIVEN THEIR EXPECTED OPERATING CASH FLOWS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND RELATED FINANCING PLANS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, DISRUPTIONS IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS, OR OTHER UNFORESEEN EVENTS WILL NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO EXECUTE THEIR EXPECTED OPERATING, CAPITAL, OR FINANCING PLANS.  \u2022  FEDERAL INCOME TAX LEGISLATION ENACTED UNDER THE TCJA WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY, AND FINANCIAL METRICS. THE TCJA, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REDUCED THE FEDERAL STATUTORY CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018. CUSTOMER RATES WERE REDUCED TO REFLECT THE LOWER INCOME TAX RATE, WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX PAYMENTS BECAUSE OF OUR USE OF NET OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS UNTIL ABOUT 2020. CUSTOMER RATES WERE ALSO REDUCED TO REFLECT THE RETURN OF EXCESS DEFERRED TAXES. THE RESULT OF THESE CUSTOMER RATE REDUCTIONS IS A DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN THE NEAR TERM. OVER TIME, THE DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS WILL BE OFFSET AS TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOOK AND TAXABLE INCOME REVERSE, AND BY INCREASED CUSTOMER RATES DUE TO HIGHER RATE BASE AMOUNTS RESULTING FROM LOWER ACCUMULATED DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITIES.  \u2022  IN 2018, OUR RATE-REGULATED BUSINESSES BEGAN TO AMORTIZE EXCESS DEFERRED TAXES. AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 AND ATXI'S INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, REFLECT A FULL YEAR OF AMORTIZATION, WHILE AMEREN MISSOURI'S INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, REFLECTS FIVE MONTHS OF AMORTIZATION RELATED TO ITS ELECTRIC BUSINESS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH A MOPSC ORDER RECEIVED IN JULY 2018. THE AMORTIZATION OF SUCH BALANCES RELATED TO AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S GAS BUSINESS STARTED IN JANUARY 2019, IN ACCORDANCE WITH A MOPSC ORDER RECEIVED IN DECEMBER 2018. THESE AMORTIZATIONS REDUCE OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATES. DUE TO FORMULA RATEMAKING, AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION AND AMEREN TRANSMISSION HAVE AN OFFSETTING REDUCTION IN REVENUE FROM CUSTOMERS, WITH NO OVERALL IMPACT ON EARNINGS. AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS INTERIM PERIOD EARNINGS COMPARISONS BETWEEN 2019 AND 2018 MAY BE AFFECTED BY TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND REVENUE REDUCTIONS BASED ON THEIR REVENUE PATTERNS; HOWEVER, NO MATERIAL IMPACT TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR EARNINGS IS EXPECTED.  \u2022  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , AMEREN HAD $70 MILLION IN TAX BENEFITS FROM FEDERAL AND STATE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND $129 MILLION IN FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. THESE CARRYFORWARDS ARE EXPECTED TO LARGELY OFFSET INCOME TAX OBLIGATIONS IN 2019. THE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS ARE EXPECTED TO BE FULLY UTILIZED IN 2019. FUTURE EXPECTED INCOME TAX PAYMENTS AND REFUNDS ARE BASED ON PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ANY RELATED INCOME TAX CREDITS AND, IN THE CASE OF AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS, CONSISTENT WITH THE TAX ALLOCATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN AMEREN (PARENT) AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. AMEREN EXPECTS TO MAKE INCOME TAX PAYMENTS BETWEEN $10 MILLION AND $50 MILLION IN EACH YEAR FROM 2019 TO 2023, TOTALING $125 MILLION TO $175 MILLION FOR THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS TO MAKE INCOME TAX PAYMENTS TO AMEREN (PARENT) OF APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION IN 2019 AND BETWEEN $20 MILLION AND $30 MILLION IN 2020. ADDITIONALLY, AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS TO RECEIVE REFUNDS FROM AMEREN (PARENT) IN EACH YEAR FROM 2021 TO 2023, TOTALING $30 MILLION TO $60 MILLION FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD. AMEREN ILLINOIS EXPECTS TO MAKE INCOME TAX PAYMENTS TO AMEREN (PARENT) BETWEEN $20 MILLION AND $40 MILLION IN 2019 AND 2020 AND BETWEEN $50 MILLION AND $70 MILLION IN EACH YEAR FROM 2021 TO 2023, TOTALING $210 MILLION TO $260 MILLION FOR THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.  \u2022  AMEREN EXPECTS ITS CASH USED FOR CURRENTLY PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND DIVIDENDS TO EXCEED CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. TO FUND A PORTION OF THESE CASH REQUIREMENTS, BEGINNING IN 2018, AMEREN BEGAN USING NEWLY ISSUED SHARES  62  OF COMMON STOCK, RATHER THAN MARKET-PURCHASED SHARES, TO SATISFY REQUIREMENTS UNDER ITS DRPLUS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO DO SO OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. AMEREN ALSO PLANS TO ISSUE INCREMENTAL COMMON EQUITY TO FUND A PORTION OF AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S WIND GENERATION INVESTMENTS. AMEREN, AMEREN MISSOURI, AND AMEREN ILLINOIS EXPECT THEIR RESPECTIVE EQUITY TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION LEVELS OVER THE PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 2023 TO REMAIN IN-LINE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE EQUITY TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION LEVELS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018. AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS EXPECT TO FUND CASH FLOW NEEDS THROUGH DEBT ISSUANCES, ADJUSTMENTS OF DIVIDENDS TO AMEREN (PARENT), AND/OR CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM AMEREN (PARENT).  THE ABOVE ITEMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND LIQUIDITY. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EVALUATE STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND LIQUIDITY. THESE STRATEGIES MAY INCLUDE ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE COSTS OR INCREASE REVENUES, AND OTHER STRATEGIC INITIATIVES TO INCREASE AMEREN\u2019S SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

NET INCOME  DECREASED  BY  $19.0 MILLION  (10%) FROM NET INCOME OF  $186.8 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN LOSSES INCURRED, NET, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME AND A DECREASE IN OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. DILUTED INCOME PER SHARE DECLINED  6 PERCENT  REFLECTING THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME, OFFSET IN PART BY A DECREASE IN OUR DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING.  ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER  2019  WAS  $167.6 MILLION  (Q2 2018.  $189.2 MILLION  ) AND ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE WAS  $0.46  (Q2 2018.  $0.50  ). ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE DECLINED  8%  REFLECTING THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME, OFFSET IN PART BY A DECREASE IN OUR DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING.  LOSSES INCURRED, NET  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  WERE  $21.8 MILLION  , AN INCREASE OF  $35.3 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO A LOWER LEVEL OF FAVORABLE LOSS RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED DELINQUENCIES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS OFFSET IN PART BY LOWER CURRENT YEAR LOSSES INCURRED AS THE ESTIMATED CLAIM RATE ON NEW NOTICES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WAS 8%, COMPARED TO 9.5% IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE DECREASE IN OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN INCOME BEFORE TAX.  IN JUNE 2019, MGIC PAID A DIVIDEND OF $70 MILLION TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY AND WE EXPECT MGIC TO CONTINUE TO PAY QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS OF AT LEAST THAT AMOUNT, SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY MGIC\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND NON-DISAPPROVAL BY THE OCI.  COMPARATIVE YEAR TO DATE RESULTS  WE RECORDED NET INCOME OF  $319.7 MILLION  , OR  $0.87  PER DILUTED SHARE DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  2019  . NET INCOME  DECREASED  BY  $10.7 MILLION  FROM NET INCOME OF  $330.5 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN LOSSES INCURRED, NET, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PREMIUMS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. DILUTED INCOME PER SHARE WAS THE SAME AS THE PRIOR YEAR AS THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME WAS OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING.  ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  WAS  $320.0 MILLION  (YTD 2018.  $333.8 MILLION  ) AND ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE WAS  $0.87  (YTD 2018.  $0.88  ).  ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE WAS ROUGHLY THE SAME AS THE PRIOR YEAR AS THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME WAS OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING.  LOSSES INCURRED, NET FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  2019  WERE  $60.9 MILLION  , AN INCREASE OF  $50.5 MILLION  OVER THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO A LOWER LEVEL OF FAVORABLE LOSS RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED DELINQUENCIES AND THE RECOGNITION OF A PROBABLE LOSS OF $23.5 MILLION FOR LITIGATION OF OUR CLAIMS PAYING PRACTICES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THE INCREASE WAS OFFSET IN PART BY LOWER CURRENT YEAR LOSSES INCURRED AS THE ESTIMATED CLAIM RATE ON NEW NOTICES IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  2019  WAS 8%, COMPARED TO 9% IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE DECREASE IN OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN INCOME BEFORE TAX.  SEE  \u201cCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d  BELOW FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS.  MGIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION - Q2 2019 |  31  CAPITAL  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS  ON MARCH 19, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM UNDER WHICH WE MAY REPURCHASE UP TO $200 MILLION OF OUR COMMON STOCK THROUGH THE END OF 2020. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 1.8 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR $25 MILLION, WHICH USED THE REMAINING AUTHORIZATION ON THE PROGRAM ANNOUNCED IN APRIL 2018. REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME ON THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS MAY BE SUSPENDED FOR PERIODS OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 354 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING.  SINCE THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, THROUGH AUGUST 5, 2019, WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 1.8 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR APPROXIMATELY $23 MILLION.  DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS  ON JULY 25, 2019, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY OF $0.06 PER SHARE PAYABLE ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2019, TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON AUGUST 30, 2019.  GSES  WE MUST COMPLY WITH THE PMIERS TO BE ELIGIBLE TO INSURE LOANS DELIVERED TO OR PURCHASED BY THE GSES. IN ADDITION TO THEIR FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, THE PMIERS INCLUDE BUSINESS, QUALITY CONTROL AND CERTAIN TRANSACTION APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS. REFER TO  \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - CAPITAL ADEQUACY - PMIERS\u201d  OF THIS MD&A FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CAPITAL ADEQUACY UNDER PMIERS.  IF MGIC CEASES TO BE ELIGIBLE TO INSURE LOANS PURCHASED BY ONE OR BOTH OF THE GSES, IT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE VOLUME OF OUR NEW BUSINESS WRITINGS. FACTORS THAT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT MGIC\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THE FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE PMIERS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  E\u0300  THE GSES MAY AMEND THE PMIERS AT ANY TIME AND MAY MAKE THE PMIERS MORE ONEROUS IN THE FUTURE. THE GSES HAVE INDICATED THAT THERE MAY BE POTENTIAL FUTURE IMPLICATIONS FOR PMIERS BASED UPON FEEDBACK THE FHFA RECEIVES ON ITS JUNE 2018 PROPOSED RULE ON REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE GSES, WHICH INCLUDED A FRAMEWORK FOR DETERMINING THE CAPITAL RELIEF ALLOWED TO THE GSES FOR LOANS WITH PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE (PUBLIC COMMENTS WERE DUE BY NOVEMBER 16, 2018). FURTHER, ANY CHANGES TO THE GSES' CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS RESULTING FROM THE TREASURY HOUSING REFORM PLAN (DISCUSSED BELOW) COULD HAVE FUTURE IMPLICATIONS FOR PMIERS. IN ADDITION, THE PMIERS PROVIDE THAT THE FACTORS THAT DETERMINE MINIMUM REQUIRED ASSETS WILL BE UPDATED EVERY TWO YEARS AND MAY BE UPDATED MORE FREQUENTLY TO REFLECT CHANGES IN MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR LOAN PERFORMANCE. THE GSES HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY WILL GENERALLY PROVIDE NOTICE 180 DAYS PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SUCH UPDATES.  E\u0300  OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE MATTERS DISCUSSED IN OUR RISK FACTORS. SUCH MATTERS COULD DECREASE OUR REVENUES, INCREASE OUR LOSSES OR REQUIRE THE USE OF ASSETS, THEREBY CREATING A SHORTFALL IN AVAILABLE ASSETS.  E\u0300  SHOULD CAPITAL BE NEEDED BY MGIC IN THE FUTURE, CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR HOLDING COMPANY MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE DUE TO COMPETING DEMANDS ON HOLDING COMPANY RESOURCES, INCLUDING FOR REPAYMENT OF DEBT.  WHILE ON AN OVERALL BASIS, THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE ASSETS MGIC MUST HOLD IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO INSURE GSE LOANS IS GREATER UNDER THE PMIERS THAN WHAT STATE REGULATION CURRENTLY REQUIRES, OUR REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF THE PMIERS ON OUR RETURNS. HOWEVER, REINSURANCE MAY NOT ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE TO US OR AVAILABLE ON SIMILAR TERMS, IT SUBJECTS US TO COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK AND THE GSES MAY CHANGE THE CREDIT THEY ALLOW UNDER THE PMIERS FOR RISK CEDED UNDER OUR REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS.  STATE REGULATIONS  THE INSURANCE LAWS OF 16 JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING WISCONSIN, MGIC\u2019S DOMICILIARY STATE, REQUIRE A MORTGAGE INSURER TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF STATUTORY CAPITAL RELATIVE TO ITS NET RIF (OR A SIMILAR MEASURE) IN ORDER FOR THE MORTGAGE INSURER TO CONTINUE TO WRITE NEW BUSINESS. WE REFER TO THESE REQUIREMENTS AS THE \u201cSTATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.\u201d WHILE THEY VARY AMONG JURISDICTIONS, THE MOST COMMON STATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ALLOW FOR A MAXIMUM RISK-TO-CAPITAL RATIO OF 25 TO 1. A RISK-TO-CAPITAL RATIO WILL INCREASE IF (I) THE PERCENTAGE DECREASE IN CAPITAL EXCEEDS THE PERCENTAGE DECREASE IN INSURED RISK, OR (II) THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN CAPITAL IS LESS THAN THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN INSURED RISK. WISCONSIN DOES NOT REGULATE CAPITAL BY USING A RISK-TO-CAPITAL MEASURE BUT INSTEAD REQUIRES AN MPP.  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , MGIC\u2019S RISK-TO-CAPITAL RATIO WAS  10.1  TO 1, BELOW THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED BY THE JURISDICTIONS WITH STATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND ITS POLICYHOLDER POSITION WAS  $2.7 BILLION  ABOVE THE REQUIRED MPP OF  $1.6 BILLION  . IN CALCULATING OUR RISK-TO-CAPITAL RATIO AND MPP, WE HAVE TAKEN FULL CREDIT FOR THE RISK CEDED UNDER OUR QSR TRANSACTIONS AND HOME RE TRANSACTIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT UNDER THE REVISED STATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DISCUSSED BELOW, MGIC WILL NOT BE ALLOWED FULL CREDIT FOR THE RISK CEDED TO THE REINSURERS. IF MGIC IS NOT ALLOWED AN AGREED LEVEL OF CREDIT UNDER EITHER THE STATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OR THE PMIERS, MGIC MAY TERMINATE THE REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS, WITHOUT PENALTY. AT THIS TIME, WE EXPECT MGIC TO CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THE CURRENT STATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS; HOWEVER, REFER TO OUR RISK FACTOR TITLED \u201cSTATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MAY PREVENT US FROM CONTINUING TO WRITE NEW INSURANCE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED BASIS\u201d FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT MATTERS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT SUCH COMPLIANCE.  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE RISK-TO-CAPITAL RATIO OF OUR COMBINED INSURANCE OPERATIONS WAS  10  TO 1.  THE NAIC PLANS TO REVISE THE MINIMUM CAPITAL AND SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS FOR MORTGAGE INSURERS THAT ARE PROVIDED FOR IN ITS MORTGAGE GUARANTY INSURANCE MODEL ACT. IN MAY 2016, A WORKING GROUP OF STATE REGULATORS RELEASED AN EXPOSURE DRAFT OF A RISK-BASED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK TO ESTABLISH CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MORTGAGE INSURERS, ALTHOUGH NO DATE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BY WHICH THE NAIC MUST PROPOSE REVISIONS TO THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND CERTAIN ITEMS HAVE NOT YET BEEN COMPLETELY ADDRESSED BY THE FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING THE TREATMENT OF CEDED RISK, MINIMUM CAPITAL FLOORS, AND ACTION LEVEL TRIGGERS. CURRENTLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE PMIERS CONTAIN MORE RESTRICTIVE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAN THE DRAFT MORTGAGE GUARANTY INSURANCE MODEL ACT IN MOST CIRCUMSTANCES.  MGIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION - Q2 2019 |  32  GSE REFORM  THE FHFA HAS BEEN THE CONSERVATOR OF THE GSES SINCE 2008 AND HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CONTROL AND DIRECT THEIR OPERATIONS. THE INCREASED ROLE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ASSUMED IN THE RESIDENTIAL HOUSING FINANCE SYSTEM THROUGH THE GSE CONSERVATORSHIP MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE GSES CHANGE IN WAYS THAT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US AND THAT THE CHARTERS OF THE GSES ARE CHANGED BY NEW FEDERAL LEGISLATION. IN THE PAST, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE INTRODUCED SEVERAL BILLS INTENDED TO CHANGE THE BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE GSES AND THE FHA; HOWEVER, NO LEGISLATION HAS BEEN ENACTED.  IN MARCH 2019, PRESIDENT TRUMP DIRECTED THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP A PLAN, AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE, FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGISLATIVE REFORMS FOR THE HOUSING FINANCE SYSTEM (\u201cTREASURY HOUSING REFORM PLAN\u201d), WITH SUCH REFORMS TO REDUCE TAXPAYER RISK, EXPAND THE PRIVATE SECTOR\u2019S ROLE, MODERNIZE THE GOVERNMENT HOUSING PROGRAMS, AND ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP. THE DIRECTIVE OUTLINES NUMEROUS GOALS AND OBJECTIVES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE END OF CONSERVATORSHIP OF THE GSES, INCREASED COMPETITION AND PARTICIPATION OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN THE MORTGAGE MARKET INCLUDING BY AUTHORIZING THE FHFA TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL GUARANTORS OF CONVENTIONAL MORTGAGES IN THE SECONDARY MARKET, APPROPRIATE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE GSES, AND EVALUATION OF THE GSE PATCH. THE GSE PATCH EXPANDS THE DEFINITION OF QUALIFIED MORTGAGE (\u201cQM\u201d) UNDER THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT (REGULATION Z) TO INCLUDE MORTGAGES ELIGIBLE TO BE PURCHASED BY THE GSES, EVEN IF THE MORTGAGES DO NOT MEET THE DTI RATIO LIMIT OF 43% INCLUDED IN THE STANDARD QM DEFINITION.  THE GSE PATCH IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE NO LATER THAN JANUARY 2021. IN JULY 2019, THE CFPB RELEASED AN ADVANCED NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING ON THE QM DEFINITION. THE DIRECTOR OF THE CFPB INDICATED THAT THE CFPB WOULD CONSIDER ONLY A SHORT-TERM EXTENSION OF THE GSE PATCH. APPROXIMATELY 30% AND 24% OF OUR NIW IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS OF 2019, RESPECTIVELY, WAS ON LOANS WITH DTI RATIOS GREATER THAN 43%. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NOT ALL FUTURE LOANS WITH DTI RATIOS GREATER THAN 43% WILL BE AFFECTED BY A SUNSET OF THE GSE PATCH, IN PART BECAUSE THE STANDARD QM DEFINITION MAY BE LIBERALIZED UNDER THE NEW RULES. IN THIS REGARD, WE NOTE THAT THE CFPB ASKED FOR COMMENT ABOUT WHETHER THE DEFINITION OF QM SHOULD RETAIN A DIRECT MEASURE OF A CONSUMER\u2019S PERSONAL FINANCES (FOR EXAMPLE, DTI RATIO); WHETHER THE DEFINITION SHOULD INCLUDE AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR ASSESSING FINANCIAL CAPACITY; WHETHER, IF THE QM DEFINITION RETAINS A DTI RATIO LIMIT, THE LIMIT SHOULD REMAIN 43% OR BE INCREASED OR DECREASED; AND WHETHER LOANS WITH DTI RATIOS ABOVE A PRESCRIBED LIMIT SHOULD BE GIVEN QM STATUS IF CERTAIN COMPENSATING FACTORS ARE PRESENT. WE MAY INSURE LOANS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AS QMS, HOWEVER, WE ARE UNSURE THE EXTENT TO WHICH LENDERS WILL MAKE NON-QM LOANS BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO THE PRESUMPTIONS ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE \u201cABILITY TO REPAY\u201d RULES THAT THE LAW ALLOWS WITH RESPECT TO QM LOANS. WE ARE ALSO UNSURE THE EXTENT TO WHICH LENDERS WILL PURCHASE PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE FOR LOANS THAT CANNOT BE SOLD TO THE GSES.  THE RULE THAT INCLUDES THE QM DEFINITION THAT APPLIES TO LOANS INSURED BY THE FHA WAS ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT (\u201cHUD\u201d) AND THAT DEFINITION IS LESS RESTRICTIVE THAN THE CFPB\u2019S DEFINITION IN CERTAIN RESPECTS, INCLUDING THAT (I) IT HAS NO DTI RATIO LIMIT, AND (II) IT ALLOWS THE LENDER CERTAIN PRESUMPTIONS ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE \u201cABILITY TO REPAY\u201d REQUIREMENTS ON HIGHER PRICED LOANS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT LENDERS WILL PREFER FHA-INSURED LOANS TO LOANS INSURED BY PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE AS A RESULT OF THE FHA\u2019S LESS RESTRICTIVE QM DEFINITION.  IN MARCH 2019, THE PRESIDENT ALSO DIRECTED THE SECRETARY OF HUD TO DEVELOP A PLAN THAT WOULD RECOMMEND ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGISLATIVE REFORMS TO THE PROGRAMS HUD OVERSEES, INCLUDING THOSE OF THE FHA AND THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE GSES, SEE OUR RISK FACTOR TITLED \u201cCHANGES IN THE BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE GSES, FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT CHANGES THEIR CHARTERS OR A RESTRUCTURING OF THE GSES COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR INCREASE OUR LOSSES.\u201d  FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY.  PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND EARNED  PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND EARNED IN A YEAR ARE INFLUENCED BY.  \u2022  NIW, WHICH INCREASES IIF. MANY FACTORS AFFECT NIW, INCLUDING THE VOLUME OF LOW DOWN PAYMENT HOME MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS AND COMPETITION TO PROVIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT ON THOSE MORTGAGES FROM THE FHA, THE VA, OTHER MORTGAGE INSURERS, AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO MORTGAGE INSURANCE, INCLUDING GSE PROGRAMS THAT MAY REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE DEMAND FOR MORTGAGE INSURANCE. NIW DOES NOT INCLUDE LOANS PREVIOUSLY INSURED BY US THAT ARE MODIFIED, SUCH AS LOANS MODIFIED UNDER HARP.  \u2022  CANCELLATIONS, WHICH REDUCE IIF. CANCELLATIONS DUE TO REFINANCINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE LEVEL OF CURRENT MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES COMPARED TO THE MORTGAGE COUPON RATES THROUGHOUT THE IN FORCE BOOK, CURRENT HOME VALUES COMPARED TO VALUES WHEN THE LOANS IN THE IN FORCE BOOK WERE INSURED AND THE TERMS ON WHICH MORTGAGE CREDIT IS AVAILABLE. HOME PRICE APPRECIATION CAN GIVE HOMEOWNERS THE RIGHT TO CANCEL MORTGAGE INSURANCE ON THEIR LOANS IF SUFFICIENT HOME EQUITY IS ACHIEVED. CANCELLATIONS ALSO RESULT FROM POLICY RESCISSIONS, WHICH REQUIRE US TO RETURN ANY PREMIUMS RECEIVED ON THE RESCINDED POLICIES AND CLAIM PAYMENTS, WHICH REQUIRE US TO RETURN ANY PREMIUM RECEIVED ON THE RELATED POLICIES FROM THE DATE OF DEFAULT ON THE INSURED LOANS. CANCELLATIONS OF SINGLE PREMIUM POLICIES, WHICH ARE GENERALLY NON-REFUNDABLE, RESULT IN IMMEDIATE RECOGNITION OF ANY REMAINING UNEARNED PREMIUM.  \u2022  PREMIUM RATES, WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY PRODUCT TYPE, COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INSURED LOANS, THE PERCENTAGE OF COVERAGE ON THE INSURED LOANS, AND PMIERS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR MONTHLY AND ANNUAL MORTGAGE INSURANCE PREMIUMS ARE UNDER PREMIUM PLANS FOR WHICH, FOR THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF THE POLICY, THE AMOUNT OF PREMIUM IS DETERMINED BY MULTIPLYING THE INITIAL PREMIUM RATE BY THE ORIGINAL LOAN  MGIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION - Q2 2019 |  33  BALANCE; THEREAFTER, THE PREMIUM RATE RESETS TO A LOWER RATE USED FOR THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE POLICY. HOWEVER, FOR LOANS THAT HAVE UTILIZED HARP, THE INITIAL TEN-YEAR PERIOD RESETS AS OF THE DATE OF THE HARP TRANSACTION. THE REMAINDER OF OUR MONTHLY AND ANNUAL PREMIUMS ARE UNDER PREMIUM PLANS FOR WHICH PREMIUMS ARE DETERMINED BY A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF THE LOAN\u2019S AMORTIZING BALANCE OVER THE LIFE OF THE POLICY.  \u2022  PREMIUMS CEDED, NET OF A PROFIT COMMISSION, UNDER OUR QSR TRANSACTIONS, AND PREMIUMS CEDED UNDER OUR HOME RE TRANSACTIONS. SEE  NOTE 4 - \u201cREINSURANCE\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS.  PREMIUMS ARE GENERATED BY THE INSURANCE THAT IS IN FORCE DURING ALL OR A PORTION OF THE PERIOD. A CHANGE IN THE AVERAGE IIF IN THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED TO AN EARLIER PERIOD IS A FACTOR THAT WILL INCREASE (WHEN THE AVERAGE IN FORCE IS HIGHER) OR REDUCE (WHEN IT IS LOWER) PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND EARNED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, ALTHOUGH THIS EFFECT MAY BE ENHANCED (OR MITIGATED) BY DIFFERENCES IN THE AVERAGE PREMIUM RATE BETWEEN THE TWO PERIODS AS WELL AS BY PREMIUMS THAT ARE RETURNED OR EXPECTED TO BE RETURNED IN CONNECTION WITH CLAIM PAYMENTS AND RESCISSIONS, AND PREMIUMS CEDED UNDER REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. ALSO, NIW AND CANCELLATIONS DURING A PERIOD WILL GENERALLY HAVE A GREATER EFFECT ON PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND EARNED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS THAN IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THESE EVENTS OCCUR.  INVESTMENT INCOME  OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS COMPOSED PRINCIPALLY OF INVESTMENT GRADE FIXED INCOME SECURITIES. THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE INVESTMENT INCOME ARE THE SIZE OF THE PORTFOLIO AND ITS YIELD. AS MEASURED BY AMORTIZED COST (WHICH EXCLUDES CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, SUCH AS FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES), THE SIZE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS MAINLY A FUNCTION OF CASH GENERATED FROM (OR USED IN) OPERATIONS, SUCH AS NPW, INVESTMENT INCOME, NET CLAIM PAYMENTS AND EXPENSES, AND CASH PROVIDED BY (OR USED FOR) NON-OPERATING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS DEBT, STOCK ISSUANCES OR REPURCHASES, OR DIVIDENDS.  LOSSES INCURRED  LOSSES INCURRED ARE THE CURRENT EXPENSE THAT REFLECTS ESTIMATED PAYMENTS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE MADE AS A RESULT OF DELINQUENCIES ON INSURED LOANS. AS EXPLAINED UNDER \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d IN OUR  2018  10-K MD&A, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A PREMIUM DEFICIENCY RESERVE, WE RECOGNIZE AN ESTIMATE OF THIS EXPENSE ONLY FOR DELINQUENT LOANS. THE LEVEL OF NEW DELINQUENCIES HAS HISTORICALLY FOLLOWED A SEASONAL PATTERN, WITH NEW DELINQUENCIES IN THE FIRST PART OF THE YEAR LOWER THAN NEW DELINQUENCIES IN THE LATTER PART OF THE YEAR, THOUGH THIS PATTERN CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY AND LOCAL HOUSING MARKETS. LOSSES INCURRED ARE GENERALLY AFFECTED BY.  \u2022  THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY, INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING VALUES, EACH OF WHICH AFFECTS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT LOANS WILL BECOME DELINQUENT AND WHETHER LOANS THAT ARE DELINQUENT CURE THEIR DELINQUENCY.  \u2022  THE PRODUCT MIX OF THE IN FORCE BOOK, WITH LOANS HAVING HIGHER RISK CHARACTERISTICS GENERALLY RESULTING IN HIGHER DELINQUENCIES AND CLAIMS.  \u2022  THE SIZE OF LOANS INSURED, WITH HIGHER AVERAGE LOAN AMOUNTS TENDING TO INCREASE LOSSES INCURRED.  \u2022  THE PERCENTAGE OF COVERAGE ON INSURED LOANS, WITH DEEPER AVERAGE COVERAGE TENDING TO INCREASE LOSSES INCURRED.  \u2022  THE RATE AT WHICH WE RESCIND POLICIES OR CURTAIL CLAIMS. OUR ESTIMATED LOSS RESERVES INCORPORATE OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE RESCISSIONS OF POLICIES AND CURTAILMENTS OF CLAIMS, AND REVERSALS OF RESCISSIONS AND CURTAILMENTS. WE COLLECTIVELY REFER TO RESCISSIONS AND DENIALS AS \u201cRESCISSIONS\u201d AND VARIATIONS OF THIS TERM. WE CALL REDUCTIONS TO CLAIMS \u201cCURTAILMENTS.\u201d  \u2022  THE DISTRIBUTION OF CLAIMS OVER THE LIFE OF A BOOK. HISTORICALLY, THE FIRST FEW YEARS AFTER LOANS ARE ORIGINATED ARE A PERIOD OF RELATIVELY LOW CLAIMS, WITH CLAIMS INCREASING SUBSTANTIALLY FOR SEVERAL YEARS SUBSEQUENT AND THEN DECLINING, ALTHOUGH PERSISTENCY, THE CONDITION OF THE ECONOMY, INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING PRICES, AND OTHER FACTORS CAN AFFECT THIS PATTERN. FOR EXAMPLE, A WEAK ECONOMY OR HOUSING VALUE DECLINES CAN LEAD TO CLAIMS FROM OLDER BOOKS INCREASING, CONTINUING AT STABLE LEVELS OR EXPERIENCING A LOWER RATE OF DECLINE.

SEE  NOTE 4 - \u201cREINSURANCE\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS.  UNDERWRITING AND OTHER EXPENSES  UNDERWRITING AND OTHER EXPENSES INCLUDES ITEMS SUCH AS EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, FEES FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, DEPRECIATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE, AND PREMIUM TAXES, AND ARE REPORTED NET OF CEDING COMMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS. EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION EXPENSES ARE VARIABLE DUE TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, CHANGES IN BENEFITS, AND HEADCOUNT (WHICH CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO VOLUME). SEE  NOTE 4 - \u201cREINSURANCE\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS DISCUSSED IN  NOTE 3 - \u201cDEBT\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND UNDER  \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d  BELOW.  OTHER  CERTAIN ACTIVITIES THAT WE DO NOT CONSIDER PART OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL OPERATING ACTIVITIES MAY ALSO IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ARE DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING.  NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES)  FIXED INCOME SECURITIES.  REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ARE A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT RECEIVED ON THE SALE OF A FIXED INCOME SECURITY AND THE FIXED INCOME SECURITY\u2019S COST BASIS, AS WELL AS ANY \u201cOTHER THAN TEMPORARY\u201d IMPAIRMENTS (\u201cOTTI\u201d) RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. THE AMOUNT RECEIVED ON THE SALE OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES IS AFFECTED BY THE COUPON RATE OF THE SECURITY COMPARED TO THE YIELD OF COMPARABLE SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF SALE.  MGIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION - Q2 2019 |  34  EQUITY SECURITIES.  REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ARE A FUNCTION OF THE PERIODIC CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE, AS WELL AS ANY OTTI RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.  REFER TO  \u201cEXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF OUR USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d  BELOW  TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE ITEMS IMPACT OUR EVALUATION OF OUR CORE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  MORTGAGE INSURANCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW CYCLE  IN GENERAL, THE MAJORITY OF ANY UNDERWRITING PROFIT THAT A BOOK GENERATES OCCURS IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE BOOK, WITH THE LARGEST PORTION OF ANY UNDERWRITING PROFIT REALIZED IN THE FIRST YEAR FOLLOWING THE YEAR THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN. SUBSEQUENT YEARS OF A BOOK MAY RESULT IN EITHER UNDERWRITING PROFIT OR UNDERWRITING LOSSES. THIS PATTERN OF RESULTS TYPICALLY OCCURS BECAUSE RELATIVELY FEW OF THE INCURRED LOSSES ON DELINQUENCIES THAT A BOOK WILL ULTIMATELY EXPERIENCE TYPICALLY OCCUR IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF THE BOOK, WHEN PREMIUM REVENUE IS HIGHEST, WHILE SUBSEQUENT YEARS ARE AFFECTED BY DECLINING PREMIUM REVENUES, AS THE NUMBER OF INSURED LOANS DECREASES (PRIMARILY DUE TO LOAN PREPAYMENTS) AND INCREASING LOSSES. THE TYPICAL PATTERN IS ALSO A FUNCTION OF PREMIUM RATES GENERALLY RESETTING TO LOWER LEVELS AFTER TEN YEARS.  MGIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION - Q2 2019 |  35  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF OUR USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  WE BELIEVE THAT USE OF THE NON-GAAP MEASURES OF ADJUSTED PRE-TAX OPERATING INCOME (LOSS), ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) AND ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE FACILITATE THE EVALUATION OF THE COMPANY'S CORE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THEREBY PROVIDING RELEVANT INFORMATION TO INVESTORS. THESE MEASURES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS ALTERNATIVES TO GAAP MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE.  ADJUSTED PRE-TAX OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)  IS DEFINED AS GAAP INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE TAX, EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES), GAIN (LOSS) ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT, NET IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN INCOME (LOSS) AND INFREQUENT OR UNUSUAL NON-OPERATING ITEMS WHERE APPLICABLE.  ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)  IS DEFINED AS GAAP NET INCOME (LOSS) EXCLUDING THE AFTER-TAX EFFECTS OF NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES), GAIN (LOSS) ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT, NET IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN INCOME (LOSS), AND INFREQUENT OR UNUSUAL NON-OPERATING ITEMS WHERE APPLICABLE. THE AMOUNTS OF ADJUSTMENTS TO COMPONENTS OF PRE-TAX OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) ARE TAX EFFECTED USING A FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 21%.  ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE  IS CALCULATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARD REGARDING EARNINGS PER SHARE BY DIVIDING (I) ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) AFTER MAKING ADJUSTMENTS FOR INTEREST EXPENSE ON CONVERTIBLE DEBT, WHENEVER THE IMPACT IS DILUTIVE BY (II) DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING, WHICH REFLECTS SHARE DILUTION FROM UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND FROM CONVERTIBLE DEBT WHEN DILUTIVE UNDER THE \u201cIF-CONVERTED\u201d METHOD.  ALTHOUGH ADJUSTED PRE-TAX OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) AND ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) EXCLUDE CERTAIN ITEMS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST AND ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE FUTURE, THE EXCLUDED ITEMS REPRESENT ITEMS THAT ARE: (1) NOT VIEWED AS PART OF THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR PRIMARY ACTIVITIES; OR (2) IMPACTED BY BOTH DISCRETIONARY AND OTHER ECONOMIC OR REGULATORY FACTORS AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OPERATING TRENDS, OR BOTH. THESE ADJUSTMENTS, ALONG WITH THE REASONS FOR THEIR TREATMENT, ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. TRENDS IN THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL OPERATING ACTIVITIES CAN BE MORE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED WITHOUT THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS. OTHER COMPANIES MAY CALCULATE THESE MEASURES DIFFERENTLY. THEREFORE, THEIR MEASURES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED BY US.  (1)  NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).  THE RECOGNITION OF NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OR LOSSES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS PERIODS AS THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES SALES IS HIGHLY DISCRETIONARY AND IS INFLUENCED BY SUCH FACTORS AS MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, OUR TAX AND CAPITAL PROFILE, AND OVERALL MARKET CYCLES.  (2)  GAINS AND LOSSES ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT.  GAINS AND LOSSES ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT RESULT FROM DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES THAT ARE UNDERTAKEN TO ENHANCE OUR CAPITAL POSITION, IMPROVE OUR DEBT PROFILE, AND/OR REDUCE POTENTIAL DILUTION FROM OUR OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE DEBT.  (3)  NET IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.  THE RECOGNITION OF NET IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN BOTH SIZE AND TIMING, DEPENDING ON MARKET CREDIT CYCLES, INDIVIDUAL ISSUER PERFORMANCE, AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  (4)  INFREQUENT OR UNUSUAL NON-OPERATING ITEMS.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO OUR IRS DISPUTE IS RELATED TO PAST TRANSACTIONS WHICH ARE NON-RECURRING IN NATURE AND ARE NOT PART OF OUR PRIMARY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

MGIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION - Q2 2019 |  37  MORTGAGE INSURANCE PORTFOLIO  NEW INSURANCE WRITTEN  ACCORDING TO  INSIDE MORTGAGE FINANCE  AND GSE ESTIMATES  ,  TOTAL MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, ON AVERAGE, ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE INCREASED FROM THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS IS GENERALLY INFLUENCED BY THE LEVEL OF NEW AND EXISTING HOME SALES, THE PERCENTAGE OF HOMES PURCHASED FOR CASH, AND THE LEVEL OF REFINANCE ACTIVITY. PMI MARKET SHARE OF TOTAL MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS IS INFLUENCED BY THE MIX OF PURCHASE AND REFINANCE ORIGINATIONS AS PMI MARKET SHARE IS 3-4 TIMES HIGHER FOR PURCHASE ORIGINATIONS THAN REFINANCE ORIGINATIONS. PMI MARKET SHARE IS ALSO IMPACTED BY THE MARKET SHARE OF TOTAL ORIGINATIONS OF THE FHA, VA, USDA, AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO MORTGAGE INSURANCE, INCLUDING GSE PROGRAMS THAT MAY REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE DEMAND FOR MORTGAGE INSURANCE.  NIW FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  WAS  $14.9 BILLION  (  Q2  2018  .  $13.2 BILLION  ) AND FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 WAS  $25.0 BILLION  (YTD 2018.  $23.8 BILLION  ). THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR NIW ON LOANS WITH DTI RATIOS GREATER THAN 45% HAS DECLINED IN 2019, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS DUE IN PART TO CHANGES IN GSE UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES AND OUR PRICING FOR LOANS WITH SUCH DTI RATIOS. WE ARE CONTINUING TO MONITOR OUR EXPOSURE TO SUCH LOANS AND MAY TAKE FURTHER ACTION.

AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE, LOAN ORIGINATORS MAY HAVE CHANGED THE INFORMATION THEY PROVIDE TO US. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE CHANGED OUR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS, WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT THE DTI RATIO WE REPORT FOR EACH LOAN BEGINNING IN LATE 2018 INCLUDES THE RELATED MORTGAGE INSURANCE PREMIUMS IN THE CALCULATION.

OUR 2009 AND LATER BOOKS POSSESS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED RISK CHARACTERISTICS WHEN COMPARED TO OUR 2005-2008 ORIGINATION YEARS. THE CREDIT PROFILE OF OUR PRE-2009 RIF HAS BENEFITED FROM MODIFICATION AND REFINANCE PROGRAMS MAKING OUTSTANDING LOANS MORE AFFORDABLE TO BORROWERS WITH THE GOAL OF REDUCING THE NUMBER OF FORECLOSURES. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDED HAMP AND HARP, WHICH EXPIRED AT THE END OF 2016 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, BUT HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY OTHER GSE MODIFICATION PROGRAMS. HARP ALLOWED BORROWERS WHO WERE NOT DELINQUENT, BUT WHO MAY NOT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REFINANCE THEIR LOANS UNDER THE CURRENT GSE UNDERWRITING STANDARDS DUE TO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CURRENT LTV EXCEEDING 100%, TO REFINANCE AND LOWER THEIR NOTE RATE.

NPW AND NPE REFLECT AN INCREASE IN CEDED PREMIUMS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH OFFSET AN INCREASE IN PREMIUMS FROM HIGHER AVERAGE INSURANCE IN FORCE AND A DECREASE IN PREMIUM REFUNDS FROM LOWER CLAIM ACTIVITY. THE INCREASE IN CEDED PREMIUMS WAS DUE TO A NON-RECURRING TERMINATION FEE RELATED TO OUR 2015 QSR TRANSACTION, PREMIUMS CEDED UNDER OUR HOME RE TRANSACTIONS, AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF OUR IIF COVERED BY QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE.

MGIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION - Q2 2019 |  41  REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS  QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE  OUR QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AFFECTS VARIOUS LINES OF OUR STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND THEREFORE WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE ANALYZED BY REVIEWING ITS TOTAL EFFECT ON OUR PRE-TAX INCOME, DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS.  E\u0300  WE CEDE A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUMS ON INSURANCE COVERED BY THE AGREEMENTS.  E\u0300  WE RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF A PROFIT COMMISSION THROUGH A REDUCTION IN THE PREMIUMS WE CEDE. THE PROFIT COMMISSION VARIES DIRECTLY AND INVERSELY WITH THE LEVEL OF LOSSES ON A \u201cDOLLAR FOR DOLLAR\u201d BASIS AND CAN BE ELIMINATED AT LOSS LEVELS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WE ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING. AS A RESULT, LOWER LEVELS OF LOSSES RESULT IN A HIGHER PROFIT COMMISSION AND LESS BENEFIT FROM CEDED LOSSES; HIGHER LEVELS OF LOSSES RESULT IN MORE BENEFIT FROM CEDED LOSSES AND A LOWER PROFIT COMMISSION (OR FOR LEVELS OF LOSSES WE DO NOT EXPECT, ITS ELIMINATION).  E\u0300  WE RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF A CEDING COMMISSION THROUGH A REDUCTION IN UNDERWRITING EXPENSES EQUAL TO 20% OF PREMIUMS CEDED (BEFORE THE EFFECT OF THE PROFIT COMMISSION).  E\u0300  WE CEDE A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF LOSSES INCURRED ON INSURANCE COVERED BY THE AGREEMENTS.  COVERED RISK  THE AMOUNT OF OUR NIW SUBJECT TO OUR QSR TRANSACTIONS AS SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE WILL VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD IN PART DUE TO COVERAGE LIMITS THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED DEPENDING ON THE MIX OF OUR RISK WRITTEN DURING THE PERIOD. THE 2019 QSR TRANSACTION COVERING OUR 2019 NIW INCREASED THRESHOLDS FOR RISK WRITTEN ON LOANS WITH LTV RATIOS OF 95% OR GREATER AND LOANS WITH DTI RATIOS GREATER THAN 45%, EACH WHEN COMPARED TO OUR 2018 QSR TRANSACTION. THE NIW SUBJECT TO QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE INCREASED FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO THE INCREASED THRESHOLD ON RISK WRITTEN ON LOANS WITH DTI RATIOS GREATER THAN 45% AND A DECREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR NIW WITH DTI RATIOS GREATER THAN 45%. IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018, THE RISK WRITTEN ON LOANS WITH DTI RATIOS GREATER THAN 45% EXCEEDED THE THRESHOLD.  WE TERMINATED A PORTION OF OUR 2015 QSR TRANSACTION EFFECTIVE JUNE 30, 2019 AND ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WITH CERTAIN PARTICIPANTS FROM THE EXISTING REINSURANCE PANEL THAT EFFECTIVELY REDUCES THE QUOTA SHARE CEDE RATE FROM 30% TO 15% ON THE REMAINING ELIGIBLE INSURANCE. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE INCURRED A TERMINATION FEE OF $6.8 MILLION, WHICH WAS PAID IN JULY TO PARTICIPANTS OF THE REINSURANCE PANEL THAT ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE AMENDED 2015 QSR TRANSACTION. UNDER THE AMENDED TERMS WE WILL GENERALLY RECEIVE A PROFIT COMMISSION PROVIDED THAT THE LOSS RATIO ON THE COVERED LOANS REMAINS BELOW 68%.

INVESTMENT INCOME  COMPARATIVE QUARTERLY AND YEAR TO DATE RESULTS  NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  2019  WAS  $42.4 MILLION  AND  $83.0 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, UP FROM  $34.5 MILLION  AND  $66.6 MILLION  IN THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE INCREASES IN INVESTMENT INCOME WERE DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE BALANCE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ALONG WITH HIGHER INVESTMENT YIELDS OVER THE PERIODS.

THE TERMS \u201cDELINQUENT\u201d AND \u201cDEFAULT\u201d ARE USED INTERCHANGEABLY BY US. WE CONSIDER A LOAN TO BE DELINQUENT WHEN IT IS TWO OR MORE PAYMENTS PAST DUE. LOSS RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED BASED ON ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF LOANS IN OUR DELINQUENT INVENTORY THAT WILL RESULT IN A CLAIM PAYMENT, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS THE CLAIM RATE, AND FURTHER ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM PAYMENT, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS CLAIM SEVERITY.  ESTIMATION OF LOSSES IS INHERENTLY JUDGMENTAL. THE CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE CLAIM RATE AND CLAIM SEVERITY INCLUDE THE CURRENT AND FUTURE STATE OF THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY, INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT, AND THE CURRENT AND FUTURE STRENGTH OF LOCAL HOUSING MARKETS. THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM PAYMENTS MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT THAN OUR LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES. OUR ESTIMATES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING A DETERIORATION OF REGIONAL OR NATIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT, LEADING TO A REDUCTION IN BORROWER INCOME AND THUS THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS, AND A DROP IN HOUSING VALUES THAT COULD RESULT IN, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GREATER LOSSES ON LOANS, AND MAY AFFECT BORROWER WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS WHEN THE VALUE OF THE HOME IS BELOW THE MORTGAGE BALANCE. HISTORICALLY, LOSSES INCURRED HAVE FOLLOWED A SEASONAL TREND IN WHICH THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR HAS WEAKER CREDIT PERFORMANCE THAN THE FIRST HALF, WITH HIGHER NEW NOTICE ACTIVITY AND A LOWER CURE RATE. OUR ESTIMATES ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY ANY AGREEMENTS WE ENTER INTO REGARDING OUR CLAIMS PAYING PRACTICES, SUCH AS THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS DISCUSSED IN  NOTE 5 \u2013 \u201cLITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. CHANGES TO OUR ESTIMATES COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPACT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION, EVEN IN A STABLE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.  COMPARATIVE QUARTERLY RESULTS  LOSSES INCURRED, NET IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  WERE  $21.8 MILLION  COMPARED TO  ($13.5) MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO A LOWER AMOUNT OF FAVORABLE LOSS RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED DELINQUENCIES. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF  2019  THERE WAS A $30 MILLION REDUCTION IN LOSSES INCURRED DUE TO POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT ON OUR PRIMARY LOSS RESERVES, BEFORE REINSURANCE, FOR PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED DELINQUENT NOTICES, COMPARED TO $70 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF  2018  .  CURRENT YEAR LOSSES INCURRED DECLINED DUE TO A LOWER ESTIMATED CLAIM RATE ON NEW NOTICES WHEN COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  COMPARATIVE YEAR TO DATE RESULTS  LOSSES INCURRED, NET IN THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  WERE  $60.9 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $10.4 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO LOWER FAVORABLE LOSS RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED DELINQUENCIES IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD, WHICH INCLUDES THE RECOGNITION OF A PROBABLE LOSS OF $23.5 MILLION FOR LITIGATION OF OUR CLAIMS PAYING PRACTICES. LOSSES INCURRED ON CURRENT YEAR DELINQUENCIES DECLINED PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOWER ESTIMATED CLAIM RATE ON NEW DELINQUENT NOTICES RECEIVED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

AS DISCUSSED IN  NOTE 11 - \u201cLOSS RESERVES,\u201d  THE AVERAGE TIME FOR SERVICERS TO PROCESS FORECLOSURES HAS RECENTLY SHORTENED. THEREFORE, WE EXPECT THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF MISSED PAYMENTS AT THE TIME A CLAIM IS RECEIVED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 18 TO 24 FOR NEW NOTICES RECEIVED, AND EXPECT TO RECEIVE IN 2019, COMPARED TO AN AVERAGE OF 37 MISSED PAYMENTS AT THE CLAIM RECEIVED DATE FOR CLAIMS PAID IN 2018. OUR LOSS RESERVES ESTIMATES TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION TRENDS OVER TIME, BECAUSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DELINQUENCIES MAY VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD WITHOUT ESTABLISHING A MEANINGFUL TREND.  THE MAJORITY OF LOANS FROM 2005 THROUGH 2008 (WHICH REPRESENT  58%  OF THE LOANS IN THE DELINQUENT INVENTORY) ARE COVERED BY MASTER POLICY TERMS THAT, EXCEPT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, DO NOT LIMIT THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT AN INSURED CAN INCLUDE INTEREST WHEN FILING A CLAIM. UNDER OUR CURRENT MASTER POLICY TERMS, AN INSURED CAN INCLUDE ACCUMULATED INTEREST WHEN FILING A CLAIM ONLY FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS THE LOAN IS DELINQUENT.

IN CONSIDERING THE POTENTIAL SENSITIVITY OF THE FACTORS UNDERLYING OUR ESTIMATE OF LOSS RESERVES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT EVEN A RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGE IN OUR ESTIMATED CLAIM RATE OR SEVERITY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON RESERVES AND, CORRESPONDINGLY, ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EVEN IN A STABLE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , ASSUMING ALL OTHER FACTORS REMAIN CONSTANT, A $1,000 INCREASE/DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE SEVERITY RESERVE FACTOR WOULD CHANGE THE RESERVE AMOUNT BY APPROXIMATELY +/- $11 MILLION. A 1 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE/DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE CLAIM RATE RESERVE FACTOR WOULD CHANGE THE RESERVE AMOUNT BY APPROXIMATELY +/- $17 MILLION.

HURRICANE ACTIVITY PRIMARILY IMPACTING TEXAS, FLORIDA, AND PUERTO RICO IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2017 INCREASED THE NUMBER OF NEW NOTICES OF DELINQUENCY REPORTED TO US IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017. CONSISTENT WITH OUR ANALYSIS AND PAST EXPERIENCE, THE MAJORITY OF THE DELINQUENT NOTICES IN THE HURRICANE AFFECTED AREAS THAT WE ESTIMATED TO BE CAUSED BY THE HURRICANES HAVE CURED AND DID NOT RESULT IN A MATERIAL INCREASE IN OUR INCURRED LOSSES OR LOSSES PAID. PAID LOSSES ON ALL LOANS IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS WERE IMPACTED IN PART BECAUSE FORECLOSURE MORATORIUMS IN THE TEXAS AND FLORIDA IADAS THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND PUERTO RICO THROUGH MAY 31, 2018, IMPACTED ALL DELINQUENT LOANS IN THOSE AREAS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT AFFECTED BY HURRICANES. FOR THOSE NOTICES WE ESTIMATED TO BE CAUSED BY THE HURRICANES, WE ESTABLISHED OUR LOSS RESERVES WITH A LOWER ESTIMATED CLAIM RATE THAN THE CLAIM RATE WE APPLIED TO OTHER NOTICES IN OUR DELINQUENT INVENTORY. WHEN EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THOSE NOTICES WE ESTIMATED TO BE CAUSED BY THE HURRICANES, THE AVERAGE TOTAL PRIMARY LOSS RESERVES PER DELINQUENCY WAS APPROXIMATELY $24,000 AT  JUNE 30, 2018.

NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  REFLECTS PURCHASES OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES IN AN AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDED OUR PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES DURING THE PERIOD AS CASH FROM OPERATIONS WAS AVAILABLE FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  REFLECTS PURCHASES OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES IN AN AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDED OUR PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES AND MATURITIES OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES DURING THE PERIOD AS CASH FROM OPERATIONS WAS AVAILABLE FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT, AS WELL AS, AMOUNTS SPENT ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  REFLECTS THE CASH SETTLEMENT OF SHARE REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS EXECUTED AT THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, SHARE REPURCHASES DURING THE PERIOD, AND PAYMENT OF WITHHOLDING TAXES RELATED TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION NET SHARE SETTLEMENT.

CAPITALIZATION  DEBT - HOLDING COMPANY  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , OUR HOLDING COMPANY\u2019S DEBT OBLIGATIONS WERE $814.5 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL CONSISTING OF OUR  5.75% NOTES AND 9% DEBENTURES. MGIC\u2019S OWNERSHIP OF $132.7 MILLION OF OUR HOLDING COMPANY\u2019S 9% DEBENTURES IS ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION, BUT THEY REMAIN OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS OWED BY OUR HOLDING COMPANY TO MGIC.  LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS - HOLDING COMPANY  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  $333 MILLION  IN CASH AND INVESTMENTS AT OUR HOLDING COMPANY. THESE RESOURCES ARE MAINTAINED PRIMARILY TO SERVICE OUR DEBT INTEREST EXPENSE, PAY DEBT MATURITIES, REPURCHASE SHARES, PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, AND TO SETTLE INTERCOMPANY OBLIGATIONS. WHILE THESE ASSETS ARE HELD, WE GENERATE INVESTMENT INCOME THAT SERVES TO OFFSET A PORTION OF OUR INTEREST EXPENSE. INVESTMENT INCOME AND THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS FROM OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF HOLDING COMPANY CASH INFLOW. MGIC IS THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF DIVIDENDS, AND THEIR PAYMENT IS RESTRICTED BY INSURANCE REGULATION. SEE  NOTE 14 - \u201cSTATUTORY INFORMATION\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT MGIC\u2019S DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS. THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS FROM MGIC IS ALSO INFLUENCED BY OUR VIEW OF THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF PMIERS AVAILABLE ASSETS TO MAINTAIN AN EXCESS OVER MINIMUM REQUIRED ASSETS. OTHER SOURCES OF HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY INCLUDE RAISING CAPITAL IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS. THE ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS IS SUBJECT TO PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, INVESTOR DEMAND FOR THE SECURITIES TO BE ISSUED, AND OUR DEEMED CREDITWORTHINESS.  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WE USED $25 MILLION OF HOLDING COMPANY CASH TO REPURCHASE SHARES AND MAY USE ADDITIONAL HOLDING COMPANY CASH TO REPURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHARES OR TO REPURCHASE OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. SUCH REPURCHASES MAY BE MATERIAL, MAY BE MADE FOR CASH (FUNDED BY DEBT) AND/OR EXCHANGES FOR OTHER SECURITIES, AND MAY BE MADE IN OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS. SEE  \u201cOVERVIEW - CAPITAL\u201d  OF THIS MD&A FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE ADDITIONAL SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED IN MARCH 2019.  IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  2019  , OUR HOLDING COMPANY CASH AND INVESTMENTS  INCREASED  BY $85 MILLION, TO  $333 MILLION  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019.  CASH  INFLOWS  DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS.  \u2022  $140 MILLION OF DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM MGIC,  \u2022  $8 MILLION OF INVESTMENT INCOME, AND  \u2022  $4 MILLION OF OTHER INFLOWS.

WE EXPECT MGIC TO CONTINUE TO PAY QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS OF AT LEAST THE $70 MILLION AMOUNT PAID IN EACH OF THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS OF  2019  , SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY MGIC\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND NON-DISAPPROVAL BY THE OCI.

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS, HOLDERS OF EACH OF THE 9% DEBENTURES MAY CONVERT THEIR NOTES INTO SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT THEIR OPTION PRIOR TO CERTAIN DATES UNDER THE TERMS OF THEIR ISSUANCE, IN WHICH CASE OUR CORRESPONDING OBLIGATION WILL BE ELIMINATED.

THE DESCRIPTION IN NOTE 7 - \u201cDEBT\u201d TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY THE TERMS OF THE NOTES AND DEBENTURES.  ALTHOUGH NOT ANTICIPATED IN THE NEAR TERM, WE MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE FUNDS TO OUR INSURANCE OPERATIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE PMIERS OR THE STATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

DEBT AT SUBSIDIARIES  MGIC IS A MEMBER OF THE FHLB, WHICH PROVIDES MGIC ACCESS TO AN ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY VIA A SECURED LENDING FACILITY. MGIC HAS $155.0 MILLION OF DEBT OUTSTANDING IN THE FORM OF A FIXED RATE ADVANCE FROM THE FHLB. INTEREST ON THE ADVANCE IS PAYABLE MONTHLY AT AN ANNUAL RATE, FIXED FOR THE TERM OF THE ADVANCE, OF 1.91%. THE PRINCIPAL OF THE ADVANCE MATURES ON FEBRUARY 10, 2023. MGIC MAY PREPAY THE ADVANCE AT ANY TIME. SUCH PREPAYMENT WOULD BE BELOW PAR IF INTEREST RATES HAVE RISEN AFTER THE ADVANCE WAS ORIGINATED, OR ABOVE PAR IF INTEREST RATES HAVE DECLINED. THE ADVANCE IS SECURED BY ELIGIBLE COLLATERAL WHOSE FAIR VALUE IS MAINTAINED AT A MINIMUM OF 102% OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE. MGIC PROVIDED ELIGIBLE COLLATERAL FROM ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  CAPITAL ADEQUACY  PMIERS  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , MGIC\u2019S AVAILABLE ASSETS UNDER PMIERS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY  $4.4 BILLION  , AN EXCESS OF APPROXIMATELY  $1.1 BILLION  OVER ITS MINIMUM REQUIRED ASSETS; AND MGIC IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PMIERS AND ELIGIBLE TO INSURE LOANS DELIVERED TO OR PURCHASED BY THE GSES. MAINTAINING A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF AVAILABLE ASSETS WILL ALLOW MGIC TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PMIERS FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING, WE BELIEVE, TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE REVISED. OUR REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS PROVIDED AN AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION OF PMIERS CAPITAL CREDIT AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  . REFER TO  NOTE 4 - \u201cREINSURANCE\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR QSR AND HOME RE TRANSACTIONS.

THE RISK-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS OUR NET RIF DIVIDED BY OUR POLICYHOLDERS\u2019 POSITION. OUR NET RIF INCLUDES BOTH PRIMARY AND POOL RISK IN FORCE, AND EXCLUDES RISK ON POLICIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN DEFAULT AND FOR WHICH LOSS RESERVES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED, AND THOSE COVERED BY REINSURANCE. THE RISK AMOUNT INCLUDES POOLS OF LOANS WITH CONTRACTUAL AGGREGATE LOSS LIMITS AND WITHOUT THESE LIMITS. POLICYHOLDERS\u2019 POSITION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF STATUTORY POLICYHOLDERS\u2019 SURPLUS (WHICH INCREASES AS A RESULT OF STATUTORY NET INCOME AND DECREASES AS A RESULT OF STATUTORY NET LOSS AND DIVIDENDS PAID), PLUS THE STATUTORY CONTINGENCY RESERVE, AND A PORTION OF THE RESERVES FOR UNEARNED PREMIUMS. THE STATUTORY CONTINGENCY RESERVE IS REPORTED AS A LIABILITY ON THE STATUTORY BALANCE SHEET. A MORTGAGE INSURANCE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO MAKE ANNUAL ADDITIONS TO THE CONTINGENCY RESERVE OF APPROXIMATELY 50% OF NET EARNED PREMIUMS. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS MUST GENERALLY BE MAINTAINED FOR A PERIOD OF TEN YEARS.  HOWEVER, WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL A MORTGAGE INSURANCE COMPANY MAY MAKE EARLY WITHDRAWALS FROM THE CONTINGENCY RESERVE WHEN INCURRED LOSSES EXCEED 35% OF NET EARNED PREMIUMS IN A CALENDAR YEAR.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE ITEMS RELATED TO OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS UPDATE AND CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  OUR OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES REPRESENT THE LOSS RESERVES ESTABLISHED TO RECOGNIZE THE LIABILITY FOR LOSSES AND LAE RELATED TO EXISTING DELINQUENCIES ON INSURED MORTGAGE LOANS. THE TIMING OF THE FUTURE CLAIM PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ESTABLISHED LOSS RESERVES WAS DETERMINED PRIMARILY BASED ON TWO KEY ASSUMPTIONS: THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES FOR A NOTICE OF DELINQUENCY TO DEVELOP INTO A RECEIVED CLAIM AND THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES FOR A RECEIVED CLAIM TO BE ULTIMATELY PAID. THE FUTURE CLAIM PAYMENT PERIODS ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND COULD EMERGE DIFFERENTLY THAN THIS ESTIMATE, IN PART, DUE TO UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN FACTORS, SUCH AS LOSS MITIGATION PROTOCOLS ESTABLISHED BY SERVICERS AND CHANGES IN SOME STATE FORECLOSURE LAWS THAT MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, A REQUIREMENT FOR ADDITIONAL REVIEW AND/OR MEDIATION PROCESS.  SEE  NOTE 11 \u2013 \u201cLOSS RESERVES\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP FOR THE MORTGAGE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, WE ESTABLISH LOSS RESERVES ONLY FOR DELINQUENT LOANS. BECAUSE OUR RESERVING METHOD DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE IMPACT OF FUTURE LOSSES THAT COULD OCCUR FROM LOANS THAT ARE NOT DELINQUENT, OUR OBLIGATION FOR ULTIMATE LOSSES THAT WE EXPECT TO OCCUR UNDER OUR POLICIES IN FORCE AT ANY PERIOD END IS NOT REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR IN THE TABLE ABOVE.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  OVERVIEW  METLIFE IS ONE OF THE WORLD\u2019S LEADING FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, PROVIDING INSURANCE, ANNUITIES, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND ASSET MANAGEMENT. METLIFE IS ORGANIZED INTO FIVE SEGMENTS: U.S.; ASIA; LATIN AMERICA; EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (\u201cEMEA\u201d); AND METLIFE HOLDINGS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY REPORTS CERTAIN OF ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN CORPORATE & OTHER. SEE NOTE  2  OF THE NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\u2019S SEGMENTS AND CORPORATE & OTHER. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY\u2019S SEGMENT PERFORMANCE AND ALLOCATED RESOURCES AND MAY ADJUST RELATED MEASUREMENTS IN THE FUTURE TO BETTER REFLECT SEGMENT PROFITABILITY.  CURRENT PERIOD HIGHLIGHTS  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, OVERALL SALES DECREASED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD PRIMARILY FROM LOWER SALES IN OUR RETIREMENT AND INCOME SOLUTIONS (\u201cRIS\u201d) BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF A LARGE PENSION RISK TRANSFER TRANSACTION IN THE PRIOR PERIOD. POSITIVE NET FLOWS DROVE AN INCREASE IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT YIELDS IMPROVED, HOWEVER, INTEREST CREDITED RATES WERE HIGHER FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR BUSINESSES. UNDERWRITING EXPERIENCE WAS MIXED, BUT OVERALL, WAS UNFAVORABLE COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD. A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES. A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN NET INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO PRIOR PERIOD LOSSES ON FAIR VALUE OPTION (\u201cFVO\u201d) BRIGHTHOUSE FINANCIAL, INC. COMMON STOCK (\u201cFVO BRIGHTHOUSE COMMON STOCK\u201d) DISPOSED OF IN JUNE 2018, AS WELL AS HIGHER GAINS ON SALES OF FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (\u201cAFS\u201d) IN THE CURRENT PERIOD VERSUS THE PRIOR PERIOD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER GAINS ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURES.  92  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS SEGMENT LEVEL RESULTS AND PERCENTAGE CONTRIBUTIONS TO TOTAL SEGMENT LEVEL ADJUSTED EARNINGS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  .  __________________  (1)  EXCLUDES CORPORATE & OTHER ADJUSTED LOSS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF  $307 MILLION.

THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED COMPANY OUTLOOK FROM THAT PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED IN THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT EXCEPT AS NOTED BELOW.  ASSUMING INTEREST RATES FOLLOW THE OBSERVABLE FORWARD YIELD CURVES AS OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE EXPECT THE AVERAGE RATIO OF FREE CASH FLOW TO ADJUSTED EARNINGS OVER THE TWO-YEAR PERIOD OF 2019 AND 2020 TO BE 65% TO 75%, ASSUMING A 10-YEAR U.S. TREASURY RATE BETWEEN 1.5% AND 4.5%. WE BELIEVE THAT FREE CASH FLOW IS A KEY DETERMINANT OF COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS AND COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES.  INDUSTRY TRENDS  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ON INDUSTRY TRENDS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2014 INDUSTRY TRENDS\u201d IN PART II, ITEM 7, OF THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT.  WE CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY THE CHANGING GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THAT HAS BEEN AFFECTING THE INDUSTRY.  94  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT  OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY GENERALLY. STRESSED CONDITIONS, VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTIONS IN GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS, PARTICULAR MARKETS, OR FINANCIAL ASSET CLASSES CAN HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US, IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVE A LARGE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND OUR INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGING MARKET FACTORS. SEE \u201cRISK FACTORS \u2014 ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CAPITAL MARKETS RISKS \u2014 DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\u201d INCLUDED IN THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT.  WE HAVE MARKET PRESENCE IN NUMEROUS COUNTRIES AND, THEREFORE, OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS POSED BY LOCAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, METLIFE IS THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF BENEFITS TO MEXICAN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, THE NEW ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT LO\u0301PEZ OBRADOR OF MEXICO IS IMPLEMENTING AN AUSTERITY PLAN WHICH, AMONG OTHER MEASURES, HAS ELIMINATED BENEFITS SUCH AS MAJOR MEDICAL INSURANCE AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO ADDITIONAL SAVINGS BENEFIT INSURANCE FOR SUCH INDIVIDUALS. SEE \u201cBUSINESS \u2014 REGULATION \u2014 FISCAL MEASURES\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS \u2014 ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CAPITAL MARKETS RISKS \u2014 DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION \u2014 CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\u201d INCLUDED IN THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT.  WE ARE CLOSELY MONITORING POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO GLOBAL MARKET VOLATILITY AND IMPACT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, EVENTS FOLLOWING THE UNITED KINGDOM\u2019S (\u201cU.K.\u201d) REFERENDUM ON JUNE 23, 2016 AND THE UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS, ASSOCIATED WITH ITS PLANNED WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION (\u201cEU\u201d), HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO GLOBAL MARKET VOLATILITY. THESE FACTORS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO WEAKENING GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, PRIMARILY IN THE U.K. AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE AND BEYOND. THE MAGNITUDE AND LONGEVITY OF THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACTS WOULD DEPEND ON THE DETAILED AGREEMENTS REACHED BY THE U.K. AND THE EU AS A RESULT OF THE NEGOTIATIONS REGARDING FUTURE TRADE AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS. SEE \u201c\u2014 INVESTMENTS \u2014 CURRENT ENVIRONMENT \u2014 SELECTED COUNTRY AND SECTOR INVESTMENTS.\u201d WE ARE ALSO MONITORING THE IMPOSITION OF TARIFFS OR OTHER BARRIERS TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE, CHANGES TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS, AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS OR A FAILURE TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING, DUE TO A POLICY IMPASSE OR OTHERWISE, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND LIQUIDITY. SEE \u201cBUSINESS \u2014 REGULATION \u2014 CROSS-BORDER TRADE\u201d AND \u201cBUSINESS \u2014 REGULATION \u2014 FISCAL MEASURES\u201d INCLUDED IN THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT. SEE ALSO \u201cRISK FACTORS \u2014 ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CAPITAL MARKETS RISKS \u2014 DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS \u2014 BUSINESS RISKS \u2014 THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS EXPOSES US TO A VARIETY OF POLITICAL, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL, ECONOMIC AND OTHER RISKS\u201d INCLUDED IN THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT.  CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD ARE USING MONETARY POLICY TO ADDRESS REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, WHICH HAD BEEN TIGHTENING POLICY BY RAISING THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AND SHRINKING THE BALANCE SHEET, NOW HAS LOWERED RATES TO SUSTAIN THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION. SIMILARLY, THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK ENDED QUANTITATIVE EASING IN DECEMBER 2018 AND LEFT INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED, BUT IS NOW CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL EASING, IF REQUIRED. IN JAPAN, THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT AND THE BANK OF JAPAN ARE MAINTAINING STIMULUS MEASURES IN ORDER TO BOOST INFLATION EXPECTATIONS AND ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN JAPAN. SUCH MEASURES INCLUDE THE IMPOSITION OF A NEGATIVE RATE ON COMMERCIAL BANK DEPOSITS, CONTINUED GOVERNMENT BOND PURCHASES AND TAX REFORM, INCLUDING THE LOWERING OF THE JAPANESE CORPORATE TAX RATE AND THE DELAY UNTIL OCTOBER 2019 OF AN INCREASE IN THE CONSUMPTION TAX TO 10%. GOING FORWARD, JAPAN\u2019S STRUCTURAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHALLENGES MAY CONTINUE TO LIMIT ITS POTENTIAL GROWTH UNLESS REFORMS THAT BOOST PRODUCTIVITY ARE PUT INTO PLACE. JAPAN\u2019S HIGH PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT LEVELS ARE MITIGATED BY LOW REFINANCING RISKS. FURTHER ACTIONS BY CENTRAL BANKS IN THE FUTURE MAY AFFECT INTEREST RATES AND RISK MARKETS IN THE U.S., EUROPE, JAPAN AND OTHER DEVELOPED AND EMERGING ECONOMIES, AND MAY ULTIMATELY RESULT IN MARKET VOLATILITY. WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE EFFECT OF THESE ACTIONS OR THE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OR DERIVATIVES. SEE \u201c\u2014 INVESTMENTS \u2014 CURRENT ENVIRONMENT.\u201d  IMPACT OF A SUSTAINED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT  DURING SUSTAINED PERIODS OF LOW INTEREST RATES, WE MAY HAVE TO INVEST INSURANCE CASH FLOWS AND REINVEST THE CASH FLOWS WE RECEIVED AS INTEREST OR RETURN OF PRINCIPAL ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN LOWER YIELDING INSTRUMENTS. MOREOVER, BORROWERS MAY PREPAY OR REDEEM THE FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, MORTGAGE LOANS AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WITH GREATER FREQUENCY IN ORDER TO BORROW AT LOWER MARKET RATES. THEREFORE, SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSE US TO THE RISK THAT A REDUCTION IN INTEREST RATES WILL REDUCE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNTS THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO CREDIT ON CONTRACTS IN OUR GENERAL ACCOUNT AND THE RATE OF RETURN WE ARE ABLE TO EARN ON INVESTMENTS INTENDED TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE CONTRACTS. THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTEREST EARNED AND INTEREST CREDITED, OR MARGIN, IS A KEY METRIC FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF, AND REPORTING FOR, MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.  95  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR EXPECTATIONS REGARDING FUTURE MARGINS ARE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT IMPACTING THE AMORTIZATION OF CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS SUCH AS DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS (\u201cDAC\u201d) AND VALUE OF BUSINESS ACQUIRED (\u201cVOBA\u201d). SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER MARGINS MAY CAUSE US TO ACCELERATE THE AMORTIZATION, THEREBY REDUCING NET INCOME IN THE AFFECTED REPORTING PERIOD. ADDITIONALLY, LOWER MARGINS MAY ALSO IMPACT THE RECOVERABILITY OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS SUCH AS GOODWILL, REQUIRE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR TRIGGER LOSS RECOGNITION EVENTS ON CERTAIN POLICYHOLDER LIABILITIES. WE REVIEW THIS LONG-TERM MARGIN ASSUMPTION, ALONG WITH OTHER ASSUMPTIONS, AS PART OF OUR ANNUAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTION REVIEW.  SOME OF OUR SEPARATE ACCOUNT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING VARIABLE ANNUITIES, HAVE CERTAIN MINIMUM GUARANTEE BENEFITS. DECLINING INTEREST RATES INCREASE THE RESERVES WE NEED TO SET UP TO PROTECT THE GUARANTEE BENEFITS, THEREBY REDUCING NET INCOME IN THE AFFECTED REPORTING PERIOD.  IN FORMULATING ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS FOR OUR INSURANCE CONTRACT ASSUMPTIONS, WE USE PROJECTIONS THAT WE MAKE REGARDING INTEREST RATES. INCLUDED IN THESE ASSUMPTIONS IS THE PROJECTION THAT THE 10-YEAR TREASURY RATE WILL RISE TO 4.25% BY 2026. SEE \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2014 INDUSTRY TRENDS \u2014 IMPACT OF A SUSTAINED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT \u2014 LOW INTEREST RATE SCENARIO\u201d INCLUDED IN THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  COMPETITIVE PRESSURES  THE LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY REMAINS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. SEE \u201cBUSINESS \u2014 COMPETITION\u201d INCLUDED IN THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS FOCUSED ON DIFFERENTIATION LEADING TO MORE INTENSE COMPETITION WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT FEATURES AND SERVICES. SEVERAL OF THE INDUSTRY\u2019S PRODUCTS CAN BE QUITE HOMOGENEOUS AND SUBJECT TO INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION. COST REDUCTION EFFORTS ARE A PRIORITY FOR INDUSTRY PLAYERS, WITH BENEFITS RESULTING IN PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO FAVOR CUSTOMERS AND REINVESTMENT CAPACITY. LARGER COMPANIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO INVEST IN BRAND EQUITY, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, TECHNOLOGY OPTIMIZATION, RISK MANAGEMENT, AND INNOVATION, WHICH ARE AMONG THE FUNDAMENTALS FOR SUSTAINED PROFITABLE GROWTH IN THE LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. INSURERS ARE FOCUSED ON THEIR CORE BUSINESSES, SPECIFICALLY IN MARKETS WHERE THEY CAN ACHIEVE SCALE. INSURERS ARE INCREASINGLY SEEKING ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF REVENUE; THERE IS A FOCUS ON MONETIZATION OF ASSETS, FEE-BASED SERVICES, AND OPPORTUNITIES TO OFFER COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS, WHICH INCLUDE PROVIDING VALUE-ADDED SERVICES ALONG WITH TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS. FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY AND TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION ARE PREREQUISITES FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH IN THE LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. LARGER MARKET PARTICIPANTS TEND TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO INVEST IN ANALYTICS, DISTRIBUTION, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO ENGAGE WITH THE NEW DIGITAL ENTRANTS. THERE IS A SHIFT IN DISTRIBUTION FROM PROPRIETARY TO THIRD PARTY MODELS IN MATURE MARKETS, DUE TO THE LOWER COST STRUCTURE. EVOLVING CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS ARE HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AS INSURERS STRIVE TO OFFER THE SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE DEMANDED BY AN INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED INDUSTRY CLIENT BASE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONTINUED VOLATILITY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ITS IMPACT ON THE CAPITAL POSITION OF MANY COMPETITORS WILL CONTINUE TO STRAIN THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. LEGISLATIVE AND OTHER CHANGES AFFECTING THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT CAN ALSO AFFECT THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND WITHIN THE BROADER FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

THE PRINCIPLE-BASED APPROACH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2017 IN THE STATES WHERE IT HAD BEEN ADOPTED, TO BE FOLLOWED BY A THREE-YEAR PHASE- IN PERIOD (AT THE OPTION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES ON A PRODUCT-BY-PRODUCT BASIS) FOR NEW BUSINESS SINCE IT WAS ENACTED INTO LAW BY THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF STATE LEGISLATURES. TO DATE, PRINCIPLE-BASED RESERVING HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY ALL OF THE STATES WHERE OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED. NEW YORK HAS ENACTED LEGISLATION THAT WILL REQUIRE PRINCIPLE-BASED RESERVING BY NO LATER THAN JANUARY 1, 2020. IN MAY 2019, THE NEW YORK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES (\u201cNYDFS\u201d) FORMALLY ADOPTED A REGULATION, WHICH WAS INITIALLY PROMULGATED AS AN EMERGENCY REGULATION IN DECEMBER 2018, UNDER WHICH THE NYDFS IS AUTHORIZED TO DEVIATE FROM THE RESERVE STANDARDS AND VALUATION METHODS SET FORTH IN THE NAIC VALUATION MANUAL (THE \u201cVALUATION MANUAL\u201d), IF THE NYDFS DETERMINES THAT AN ALTERNATIVE REQUIREMENT WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE POLICYHOLDERS OF NEW YORK. THE NYDFS IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING AN AMENDED VERSION OF THE REGULATION THAT WILL CONTAIN DEVIATIONS FROM THE VALUATION MANUAL FORMULAIC FLOOR THAT WILL BE A REQUIREMENT IN NEW YORK.  ERISA, FIDUCIARY CONSIDERATIONS, AND OTHER PENSION AND RETIREMENT REGULATION  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (\u201cDOL\u201d) ISSUED REGULATIONS THAT LARGELY WERE APPLICABLE IN 2017 THAT EXPANDED THE DEFINITION OF \u201cINVESTMENT ADVICE\u201d AND REQUIRED AN ADVISOR TO MEET AN IMPARTIAL OR \u201cBEST INTERESTS\u201d STANDARD (\u201cBICE\u201d), BUT THE REGULATIONS WERE FORMALLY VACATED BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT IN 2018. THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION ALSO VACATED CERTAIN DOL AMENDMENTS TO PROHIBITED TRANSACTION EXEMPTIONS. THE DOL HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT PLANS TO ISSUE REVISED FIDUCIARY INVESTMENT ADVICE REGULATIONS IN DECEMBER 2019. AT THIS TIME, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT FORM THOSE REGULATIONS MAY TAKE OR THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON US.  IN JUNE 2019, THE U.S SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) ADOPTED RULES AND INTERPRETATIONS ADDRESSING THE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT APPLICABLE TO BROKER-DEALERS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED PERSONS. THE CONDUCT STANDARDS APPLY WHEN PROVIDING BROKERAGE AND ADVISORY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO BENEFIT PLANS GOVERNED BY THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d) AND INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS (\u201cIRAS\u201d), AS WELL AS NON-BENEFIT PLAN RETAIL CLIENTS. UNDER THE SEC RULES, BROKER-DEALERS ARE NOT DEEMED TO BE FIDUCIARIES TO THEIR CLIENTS BY VIRTUE OF MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS BUT MUST ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR RETAIL CLIENTS WHEN MAKING A RECOMMENDATION. THE SEC\u2019S BEST INTEREST STANDARD IS NOT INTENDED TO TRACK THE DOL\u2019S FORMER BICE STANDARD. UNLIKE THE DOL RULE THAT WAS VACATED IN 2018, THERE IS NO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF THESE SEC RULES. THE DOL IS EXPECTED TO ADOPT A NEW RULE THAT WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE SEC\u2019S RULES, INCLUDING THE NEW BEST INTEREST STANDARD.  STATE REGULATORS AND LEGISLATURES IN NEVADA, NEW JERSEY, MARYLAND AND NEW YORK HAVE PROPOSED MEASURES THAT WOULD MAKE BROKER-DEALERS, SALES AGENTS, AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES SUBJECT TO A FIDUCIARY DUTY WHEN PROVIDING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING PENSION PLANS AND IRAS. THE SEC DID NOT INDICATE AN INTENT TO PRE-EMPT STATE REGULATION IN THIS AREA, AND SOME OF THE STATE PROPOSALS WOULD ALLOW FOR A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AS A RESULT OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT MAY BECOME MORE COSTLY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO PENSION PLANS AND IRAS OPERATING IN THE STATES SUBJECT TO THE NEW RULES.  IN OCTOBER 2018, CHILEAN PRESIDENT SEBASTIEN PIN\u0303ERA SUBMITTED TO CONGRESS A NEW PENSION REFORM BILL. IN JUNE 2019, THE GOVERNMENT AGREED WITH THE OPPOSITION PARTY TO INTRODUCE AN AMENDMENT TO THE BILL WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A SINGLE STATE-RUN ENTITY TO MANAGE NEW 4% MANDATORY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WHILE THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WOULD NOT IMPACT THE 10% MANDATORY EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS MANAGED BY OUR PENSION ADMINISTRATION BUSINESS IN CHILE, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE TERMS OF THE FINAL BILL AND CANNOT CURRENTLY IDENTIFY ALL OF THE RISKS OR OPPORTUNITIES, IF ANY, THAT MAY BE POSED TO OUR BUSINESS IN CHILE. WHILE PRESIDENT PIN\u0303ERA\u2019S ADMINISTRATION HAS EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCELERATING DEBATE ON THE PENSION REFORM BILL, WE EXPECT THAT THE CONGRESSIONAL DEBATE MAY LAST THROUGH MOST OF 2019.  97  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DERIVATIVES REGULATION  IN JUNE 2019, THE SEC ADOPTED A SET OF RULES THAT ESTABLISH CAPITAL AND MARGIN REQUIREMENTS FOR SECURITY-BASED SWAPS. THE RULES ARE PART OF THE LARGER REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT THE SEC IS ESTABLISHING OVER SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS THAT IMPOSES REGISTRATION, DISQUALIFICATION, RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, AND CROSS-BORDER REGULATION. THE RULES WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE 18 MONTHS AFTER THE ADOPTION BY THE SEC OF RULES ON RECORDKEEPING AND CROSS-BORDER REGULATION OF SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AND ARE PENDING. WE ARE MONITORING THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT THESE RULES MIGHT HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS.  SECURITIES, BROKER-DEALER AND INVESTMENT ADVISER REGULATION  IN JUNE 2019, THE SEC ADOPTED RULES AND INTERPRETATIONS ADDRESSING THE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT APPLICABLE TO BROKER-DEALERS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED PERSONS, INCLUDING REGULATION BEST INTEREST, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON OFFERINGS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT OF THE NEW RULES, BEGINNING JUNE 30, 2020, BROKER-DEALERS RECOMMENDING OUR VARIABLE PRODUCTS TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH A \u201cBEST INTEREST\u201d STANDARD, WHICH THE SEC DID NOT DEFINE BUT DID CONFIRM WOULD BE HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT SUITABILITY STANDARD BUT NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF BEING A FIDUCIARY, AND PROVIDE DISCLOSURES ABOUT THEIR STANDARD OF CONDUCT AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING ON NEW FORM CRS. INVESTMENT ADVISERS TO RETAIL CLIENTS WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO FILE NEW FORM CRS WITH THE SEC AND DELIVER COPIES OF THE FORM TO THEIR RETAIL CLIENTS. AS NOTED ABOVE, THE SEC RULES DO NOT INCLUDE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. WE ARE MONITORING THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND CANNOT AT THIS TIME PREDICT THE EFFECT THEY MIGHT HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS.  SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO ADOPT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT AMOUNTS REPORTED ON THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE MOST CRITICAL ESTIMATES INCLUDE THOSE USED IN DETERMINING.  (I)  LIABILITIES FOR FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS AND THE ACCOUNTING FOR REINSURANCE;  (II)  CAPITALIZATION AND AMORTIZATION OF DAC AND THE ESTABLISHMENT AND AMORTIZATION OF VOBA;  (III)  ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF INVESTMENTS IN THE ABSENCE OF QUOTED MARKET VALUES;  (IV)  INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS;  (V)  ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES AND THE RECOGNITION AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES REQUIRING BIFURCATION;  (VI)  MEASUREMENT OF GOODWILL AND RELATED IMPAIRMENT;  (VII)  MEASUREMENT OF EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN LIABILITIES;  (VIII)  MEASUREMENT OF INCOME TAXES AND THE VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS; AND  (IX)  LIABILITIES FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS.  IN ADDITION, THE APPLICATION OF ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING REQUIRES THE USE OF ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES IN DETERMINING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED \u2014 THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH RELATE TO THE AFOREMENTIONED CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES. IN APPLYING THESE POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, MANAGEMENT MAKES SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS THAT FREQUENTLY REQUIRE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. MANY OF THESE POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND RELATED JUDGMENTS ARE COMMON IN THE INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES; OTHERS ARE SPECIFIC TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  THE ABOVE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE DESCRIBED IN \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2014 SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\u201d AND NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT.  ECONOMIC CAPITAL  ECONOMIC CAPITAL IS AN INTERNALLY DEVELOPED RISK CAPITAL MODEL, THE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS TO MEASURE THE RISK IN THE BUSINESS AND TO PROVIDE A BASIS UPON WHICH CAPITAL IS DEPLOYED. THE ECONOMIC CAPITAL MODEL ACCOUNTS FOR THE UNIQUE AND SPECIFIC NATURE OF THE RISKS INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESS.  98  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR ECONOMIC CAPITAL MODEL, COUPLED WITH CONSIDERATIONS OF LOCAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, ALIGNS SEGMENT ALLOCATED EQUITY WITH EMERGING STANDARDS AND CONSISTENT RISK PRINCIPLES. THE MODEL APPLIES STATISTICS-BASED RISK EVALUATION PRINCIPLES TO THE MATERIAL RISKS TO WHICH THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED. THESE CONSISTENT RISK PRINCIPLES INCLUDE CALIBRATING REQUIRED ECONOMIC CAPITAL SHOCK FACTORS TO A SPECIFIC CONFIDENCE LEVEL AND TIME HORIZON WHILE APPLYING AN INDUSTRY STANDARD METHOD FOR THE INCLUSION OF DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS AMONG RISK TYPES. ECONOMIC CAPITAL-BASED RISK ESTIMATION IS AN EVOLVING SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES HAVE EMERGED AND CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. AREAS OF EVOLVING INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES INCLUDE STOCHASTIC LIABILITY VALUATION TECHNIQUES, ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGIES FOR THE CALCULATION OF DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS, AND THE QUANTIFICATION OF APPROPRIATE SHOCK LEVELS. METLIFE\u2019S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ONGOING PRODUCTION AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE ECONOMIC CAPITAL MODEL AND REVIEWS ITS APPROACH PERIODICALLY TO ENSURE THAT IT REMAINS CONSISTENT WITH EMERGING INDUSTRY PRACTICE STANDARDS.  SEGMENT NET INVESTMENT INCOME IS CREDITED OR CHARGED BASED ON THE LEVEL OF ALLOCATED EQUITY; HOWEVER, CHANGES IN ALLOCATED EQUITY DO NOT IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME, NET INCOME (LOSS), OR ADJUSTED EARNINGS.  NET INVESTMENT INCOME IS BASED UPON THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF EACH SEGMENT\u2019S SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIABLE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS ADJUSTED FOR ALLOCATED EQUITY. OTHER COSTS ARE ALLOCATED TO EACH OF THE SEGMENTS BASED UPON: (I) A REVIEW OF THE NATURE OF SUCH COSTS; (II) TIME STUDIES ANALYZING THE AMOUNT OF EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION COSTS INCURRED BY EACH SEGMENT; AND (III) COST ESTIMATES INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCT PRICING.  ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS  FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL ITS TWO WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, METLIFE LIMITED AND METROPOLITAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF HONG KONG LIMITED (COLLECTIVELY, \u201cMETLIFE HONG KONG\u201d), SEE  NOTE 3  OF THE NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  99  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  BUSINESS OVERVIEW.  OVERALL SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 DECREASED FROM PRIOR PERIOD LEVELS DESPITE HIGHER SALES IN MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, DUE TO A LARGE PENSION RISK TRANSFER TRANSACTION IN THE PRIOR PERIOD IN OUR RIS BUSINESS. EXCLUDING THIS TRANSACTION, SALES IN OUR U.S. SEGMENT IMPROVED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN FUNDING AGREEMENT ISSUANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES OF STABLE VALUE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, SALES IMPROVED IN OUR GROUP BENEFITS BUSINESS. LOWER SALES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED ANNUITY PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ACCIDENT & HEALTH PRODUCT SALES, BOTH IN JAPAN, WAS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF LOWER SALES IN OUR ASIA SEGMENT. SALES IN OUR LATIN AMERICA SEGMENT IMPROVED AS A RESULT OF HIGHER SALES OF INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP LIFE PRODUCTS IN BRAZIL, MEXICO AND CHILE AND HIGHER SALES OF INDIVIDUAL ACCIDENT & HEALTH AND RETIREMENT PRODUCTS IN CHILE. IN OUR EMEA SEGMENT, SALES IMPROVED AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN OUR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS BUSINESS IN THE U.K. AND EGYPT AND OUR CREDIT LIFE BUSINESS IN TURKEY.

WE MANAGE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO USING DISCIPLINED ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT (\u201cALM\u201d) PRINCIPLES, FOCUSING ON CASH FLOW AND DURATION TO SUPPORT OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE LIABILITIES. OUR INTENT IS TO MATCH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF LIABILITY CASH OUTFLOWS WITH INVESTED ASSETS THAT HAVE CASH INFLOWS OF COMPARABLE TIMING AND AMOUNT, WHILE OPTIMIZING RISK-ADJUSTED NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND RISK-ADJUSTED TOTAL RETURN. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARD FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, WITH OVER 80% OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTED IN FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (\u201cAFS\u201d) AND MORTGAGE LOANS. THESE SECURITIES AND LOANS HAVE VARYING MATURITIES AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS WHICH CAUSE THEM TO BE GENERALLY WELL SUITED FOR MATCHING THE CASH FLOW AND DURATION OF INSURANCE LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, OUR GENERAL ACCOUNT INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES, WITHIN CONTRACTHOLDER-DIRECTED EQUITY SECURITIES AND FVO SECURITIES (COLLECTIVELY, \u201cUNIT-LINKED AND FVO SECURITIES\u201d), CONTRACTHOLDER-DIRECTED EQUITY SECURITIES SUPPORTING UNIT-LINKED VARIABLE ANNUITY TYPE LIABILITIES (\u201cUNIT-LINKED INVESTMENTS\u201d), WHICH DO NOT QUALIFY AS SEPARATE ACCOUNT ASSETS. RETURNS ON THESE UNIT-LINKED INVESTMENTS, WHICH CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, INCLUDE CHANGES IN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE SUBSEQUENT TO PURCHASE, INURE TO CONTRACTHOLDERS AND ARE OFFSET IN EARNINGS BY A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES THROUGH INTEREST CREDITED TO POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES.  WE PURCHASE INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT OUR INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND NOT TO GENERATE NET INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES. HOWEVER, NET INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCURRED AND CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO CHANGES IN EXTERNAL INFLUENCES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CREDIT SPREADS AND EQUITY MARKETS; COUNTERPARTY SPECIFIC FACTORS SUCH AS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING AND COLLATERAL VALUATION; AND INTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS PORTFOLIO REBALANCING. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE LEVELS OF BOTH IMPAIRMENTS AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS SOLD.  WE ALSO USE DERIVATIVES AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR MANAGEMENT OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND INSURANCE LIABILITIES TO HEDGE CERTAIN RISKS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CREDIT SPREADS AND EQUITY MARKET LEVELS. WE USE FREESTANDING INTEREST RATE, EQUITY, CREDIT AND CURRENCY DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE CERTAIN INVESTED ASSETS AND INSURANCE LIABILITIES. A PORTION OF THESE HEDGES ARE DESIGNATED AND QUALIFY AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES, WHICH REDUCE VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS. FOR THOSE HEDGES NOT DESIGNATED AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES, CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS LEAD TO THE RECOGNITION OF FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) GENERALLY WITHOUT AN OFFSETTING GAIN OR LOSS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR THE ITEM BEING HEDGED, WHICH CREATES VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS. WE ACTIVELY EVALUATE MARKET RISK HEDGING NEEDS AND STRATEGIES TO ENSURE OUR FREE CASH FLOW AND CAPITAL OBJECTIVES ARE MET UNDER A RANGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS.  CERTAIN VARIABLE ANNUITY PRODUCTS WITH GUARANTEED MINIMUM BENEFITS CONTAIN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES THAT ARE MEASURED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE SEPARATELY FROM THE HOST VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACT, WITH CHANGES IN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES). WE USE FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE THE MARKET RISKS INHERENT IN THESE VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEES. ONGOING REFINEMENT OF THE STRATEGY MAY BE REQUIRED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NAIC RULES RELATED TO A STATUTORY ACCOUNTING ELECTION FOR DERIVATIVES THAT MITIGATE INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY RELATED TO VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEES. THE RESTRUCTURED HEDGE STRATEGY IS CLASSIFIED AS A MACRO HEDGE PROGRAM, INCLUDED IN THE NON-VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES SECTION OF THE TABLE BELOW, TO PROTECT OUR OVERALL STATUTORY CAPITAL FROM SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE VALUATION OF THESE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES INCLUDES A NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENT, WHICH IS UNHEDGED, AND CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) AND VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS, BUT DOES NOT HAVE AN ECONOMIC IMPACT ON US.  101  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES).  THE VARIABLE ANNUITY EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES AND ASSOCIATED FREESTANDING DERIVATIVE HEDGES ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \u201cVA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES.\u201d ALL OTHER DERIVATIVES THAT ARE ECONOMIC HEDGES OF CERTAIN INVESTED ASSETS AND INSURANCE LIABILITIES ARE REFERRED TO AS \u201cNON-VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES.\u201d THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE IMPACT ON NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) FROM NON-VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES AND VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES.  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019  2018  (IN MILLIONS)  NON-VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES  INTEREST RATE  $884  $(2  )  FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE  56  2  CREDIT  64  (4  )  EQUITY  (52  )  (18  )  NON-VA EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  (47  )  (2  )  TOTAL NON-VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES  905  (24  )  VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES  MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  (19  )  256  NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENT ON EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  (13  )  (25  )  OTHER RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  (67  )  (78  )  TOTAL EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  (99  )  153  FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES HEDGING EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  (82  )  (188  )  TOTAL VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES  (181  )  (35  )  NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES)  $724  $(59  )  THE FAVORABLE CHANGE IN NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) ON NON-VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES WAS $929 MILLION ($734 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX). THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LONG-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES DECREASING IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND INCREASING IN THE PRIOR PERIOD, FAVORABLY IMPACTING RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND OPTIONS.  THE UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) ON VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES WAS $146 MILLION ($115 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX). THIS WAS DUE TO AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE OF $169 MILLION ($134 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, NET OF FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES HEDGING MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A FAVORABLE CHANGE OF $12 MILLION ($9 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN THE NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENT ON EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, AND A FAVORABLE CHANGE OF $11 MILLION, ($9 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN OTHER RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. OTHER RISKS RELATE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPACT OF POLICYHOLDER BEHAVIOR AND OTHER NON-MARKET RISKS THAT GENERALLY CANNOT BE HEDGED.  THE AFOREMENTIONED $169 MILLION ($134 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) UNFAVORABLE CHANGE REFLECTS A $275 MILLION ($217 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $106 MILLION ($84 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) FAVORABLE CHANGE IN FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES HEDGING MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES.  THE PRIMARY CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  LONG-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES DECREASED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND INCREASED IN THE PRIOR PERIOD, CONTRIBUTING TO A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES AND AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE 30-YEAR U.S. SWAP RATE DECREASED 37 BASIS POINTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND INCREASED 11 BASIS POINTS IN THE PRIOR PERIOD.  \u2022  CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CONTRIBUTED TO A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES AND AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES RELATED TO THE ASSUMED VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEES FROM OUR FORMER OPERATING JOINT VENTURE IN JAPAN. FOR EXAMPLE, THE JAPANESE YEN STRENGTHENED AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR BY 3% IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND WEAKENED BY 4% IN THE PRIOR PERIOD.  THE AFOREMENTIONED $11 MILLION ($9 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) FAVORABLE CHANGE IN OTHER RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES REFLECTS A COMBINATION OF FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE FEES BEING DEDUCTED FROM ACCOUNTS, CHANGES IN THE BENEFIT BASE, PREMIUMS, LAPSES, WITHDRAWALS AND DEATHS.  102  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE AFOREMENTIONED $12 MILLION ($9 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) FAVORABLE CHANGE IN THE NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENT ON EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES RESULTED FROM A FAVORABLE CHANGE OF $34 MILLION, BEFORE INCOME TAX, AS A RESULT OF MODEL CHANGES AND CHANGES IN CAPITAL MARKET INPUTS, SUCH AS LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES AND KEY EQUITY INDEX LEVELS, ON VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE OF $22 MILLION, BEFORE INCOME TAX, RELATED TO CHANGES IN OUR OWN CREDIT SPREAD.  WHEN EQUITY INDEX LEVELS DECREASE IN ISOLATION, THE VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEES BECOME MORE VALUABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHICH RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN THE UNDISCOUNTED EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE LIABILITY. DISCOUNTING THIS UNFAVORABLE CHANGE BY THE RISK ADJUSTED RATE YIELDS A SMALLER LOSS THAN BY DISCOUNTING AT THE RISK-FREE RATE, THUS CREATING A GAIN FROM INCLUDING AN ADJUSTMENT FOR NONPERFORMANCE RISK.  WHEN THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE DECREASES IN ISOLATION, DISCOUNTING THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE LIABILITY PRODUCES A HIGHER VALUATION OF THE LIABILITY THAN IF THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE HAD REMAINED CONSTANT. DISCOUNTING THIS UNFAVORABLE CHANGE BY THE RISK ADJUSTED RATE YIELDS A SMALLER LOSS THAN BY DISCOUNTING AT THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE, THUS CREATING A GAIN FROM INCLUDING AN ADJUSTMENT FOR NONPERFORMANCE RISK.  WHEN OUR OWN CREDIT SPREAD INCREASES IN ISOLATION, DISCOUNTING THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE LIABILITY PRODUCES A LOWER VALUATION OF THE LIABILITY THAN IF OUR OWN CREDIT SPREAD HAD REMAINED CONSTANT. AS A RESULT, A GAIN IS CREATED FROM INCLUDING AN ADJUSTMENT FOR NONPERFORMANCE RISK. FOR EACH OF THESE PRIMARY MARKET DRIVERS, THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OCCURS WHEN THE DRIVER MOVES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  NET INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).  THE FAVORABLE CHANGE IN NET INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) OF $288 MILLION ($228 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) PRIMARILY REFLECTS PRIOR PERIOD LOSSES ON FVO BRIGHTHOUSE COMMON STOCK DISPOSED OF IN JUNE 2018, AS WELL AS HIGHER GAINS ON SALES OF FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES AFS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD VERSUS THE PRIOR PERIOD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER GAINS ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURES.  DIVESTED BUSINESSES  . INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX RELATED TO THE DIVESTED BUSINESSES, EXCLUDING NET INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) AND NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES), INCREASED $77 MILLION ($61 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) TO A LOSS OF $6 MILLION ($5 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN THE CURRENT PERIOD FROM A LOSS OF $83 MILLION ($66 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN THE PRIOR PERIOD. INCLUDED IN THIS INCREASE WAS A DECREASE IN TOTAL EXPENSES OF $77 MILLION, BEFORE INCOME TAX. DIVESTED BUSINESSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE ACTIVITY RELATED TO THE SEPARATION OF BRIGHTHOUSE FINANCIAL, INC. (THE \u201cSEPARATION\u201d).  TAXES.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX WAS 24%. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DIFFERED FROM THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO TAX CHARGES FROM FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT DIFFERENT RATES THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE AND THE IMPACT FROM THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL METLIFE HONG KONG, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO NON-TAXABLE INVESTMENT INCOME AND TAX CREDITS. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX WAS 19%. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DIFFERED FROM THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO NON-TAXABLE INVESTMENT INCOME, TAX CREDITS AND A NON-CASH TRANSFER OF ASSETS FROM A WHOLLY-OWNED U.K. INVESTMENT SUBSIDIARY TO ITS U.S. PARENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TAX CHARGES FROM FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT DIFFERENT RATES THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE AND A NON-DEDUCTIBLE LOSS INCURRED ON THE MARK-TO-MARKET AND DISPOSITION OF FVO BRIGHTHOUSE COMMON STOCK.  ADJUSTED EARNINGS  . AS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN \u201c\u2014 NON-GAAP AND OTHER FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES,\u201d WE USE ADJUSTED EARNINGS, WHICH DOES NOT EQUATE TO NET INCOME (LOSS), AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, TO ANALYZE OUR PERFORMANCE, EVALUATE SEGMENT PERFORMANCE, AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS AND OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES BASED ON ADJUSTED EARNINGS, AS WE MEASURE IT FOR MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, ENHANCES THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PERFORMANCE BY HIGHLIGHTING THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE UNDERLYING PROFITABILITY DRIVERS OF THE BUSINESS. ADJUSTED EARNINGS AND OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES BASED ON ADJUSTED EARNINGS ALLOW ANALYSIS OF OUR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND FACILITATE COMPARISONS TO INDUSTRY RESULTS. ADJUSTED EARNINGS SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME (LOSS). ADJUSTED EARNINGS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS SUBSTITUTES FOR NET INCOME (LOSS) AVAILABLE TO METLIFE, INC.\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS. ADJUSTED EARNINGS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS DECREASED $7 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX, TO $1,319 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $1,326 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  103  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED WITH THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, NET INCOME (LOSS) INCREASED $980 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE CHANGES IN NET INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) AND NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES).  NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES).  THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE IMPACT ON NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) FROM NON-VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES AND VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES.  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019  2018  (IN MILLIONS)  NON-VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES  INTEREST RATE  $1,311  $(99  )  FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE  54  289  CREDIT  201  (33  )  EQUITY  (278  )  (1  )  NON-VA EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  (130  )  24  TOTAL NON-VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES  1,158  180  VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES  MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  366  252  NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENT ON EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  (75  )  (5  )  OTHER RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  (114  )  (83  )  TOTAL EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  177  164  FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES HEDGING EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES  (496  )  (54  )  TOTAL VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES  (319  )  110  NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES)  $839  $290  THE FAVORABLE CHANGE IN NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) ON NON-VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES WAS $978 MILLION ($773 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX). THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN INTEREST RATE IMPACT DUE TO: (I) LONG-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES DECREASING IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND INCREASING IN THE PRIOR PERIOD, FAVORABLY IMPACTING RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS, OPTIONS AND TOTAL RATE OF RETURN SWAPS; AND (II) MID-TERM RATES DECREASING IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND INCREASING IN THE PRIOR PERIOD, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING INTEREST RATE CAPS. IN ADDITION, CREDIT SPREADS NARROWED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND WIDENED IN THE PRIOR PERIOD, FAVORABLY IMPACTING WRITTEN CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS USED IN REPLICATIONS. THESE FAVORABLE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF EQUITY MARKETS INCREASING MORE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD VERSUS THE PRIOR PERIOD, UNFAVORABLY IMPACTING EQUITY OPTIONS ACQUIRED PRIMARILY AS PART OF OUR MACRO HEDGE PROGRAM. ALSO, THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN THE CURRENT PERIOD VERSUS THE PRIOR PERIOD RELATIVE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED FOREIGN CURRENCY SWAPS AND FORWARDS THAT PRIMARILY HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BONDS. THERE WAS ALSO A CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS, UNFAVORABLY IMPACTING NON-VA EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES RELATED TO FUNDS WITHHELD ON A CERTAIN REINSURANCE AGREEMENT. BECAUSE CERTAIN OF THESE HEDGING STRATEGIES ARE NOT DESIGNATED OR DO NOT QUALIFY AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES, THE CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) WITHOUT AN OFFSETTING GAIN OR LOSS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED.  THE UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) ON VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES WAS $429 MILLION ($339 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX). THIS WAS DUE TO AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE OF $328 MILLION ($259 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES HEDGING MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, NET OF MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE OF $70 MILLION ($55 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN THE NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENT ON EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, AND AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE OF $31 MILLION, ($24 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN OTHER RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. OTHER RISKS RELATE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPACT OF POLICYHOLDER BEHAVIOR AND OTHER NON-MARKET RISKS THAT GENERALLY CANNOT BE HEDGED.  THE AFOREMENTIONED $328 MILLION ($259 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) UNFAVORABLE CHANGE REFLECTS A $442 MILLION ($349 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES HEDGING MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $114 MILLION ($90 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) FAVORABLE CHANGE IN MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES.  104  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE PRIMARY CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  KEY EQUITY INDEX LEVELS INCREASED MORE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD VERSUS THE PRIOR PERIOD, CONTRIBUTING TO AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES AND A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE S&P 500 INDEX INCREASED 17% IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND 2% IN THE PRIOR PERIOD.  \u2022  LONG-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES DECREASED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND INCREASED IN THE PRIOR PERIOD, CONTRIBUTING TO A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES AND AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE 30-YEAR U.S. SWAP RATE DECREASED 62 BASIS POINTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND INCREASED 39 BASIS POINTS IN THE PRIOR PERIOD.  \u2022  CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CONTRIBUTED TO AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES AND A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES RELATED TO THE ASSUMED VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEES FROM OUR FORMER OPERATING JOINT VENTURE IN JAPAN. FOR EXAMPLE, THE JAPANESE YEN STRENGTHENED AGAINST THE EURO BY 2% IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND BY 4% IN THE PRIOR PERIOD.  THE AFOREMENTIONED $31 MILLION ($24 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN OTHER RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES REFLECTS INCREASED GUARANTEE CLAIMS COSTS AND A COMBINATION OF OTHER FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE FEES BEING DEDUCTED FROM ACCOUNTS, CHANGES IN THE BENEFIT BASE, PREMIUMS, LAPSES, WITHDRAWALS AND DEATHS.  THE AFOREMENTIONED $70 MILLION ($55 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN THE NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENT ON EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES RESULTED FROM AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE OF $70 MILLION, BEFORE INCOME TAX, RELATED TO CHANGES IN OUR OWN CREDIT SPREAD.  NET INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).  THE FAVORABLE CHANGE IN NET INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) OF $636 MILLION ($502 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) PRIMARILY REFLECTS PRIOR PERIOD LOSSES ON FVO BRIGHTHOUSE COMMON STOCK DISPOSED OF IN JUNE 2018, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN MARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES ON EQUITY SECURITIES, BOTH OF WHICH WERE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH NET INCOME. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WERE GAINS ON SALES OF FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES AFS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD VERSUS LOSSES IN THE PRIOR PERIOD. THESE FAVORABLE CHANGES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER GAINS ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURES.  DIVESTED BUSINESSES  . INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX RELATED TO THE DIVESTED BUSINESSES, EXCLUDING NET INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) AND NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES), INCREASED $79 MILLION ($62 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) TO A LOSS OF $6 MILLION ($5 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN THE CURRENT PERIOD FROM A LOSS OF $85 MILLION ($67 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN THE PRIOR PERIOD. INCLUDED IN THIS INCREASE WAS A DECREASE IN TOTAL REVENUES OF $7 MILLION, BEFORE INCOME TAX, AND A DECREASE IN TOTAL EXPENSES OF $86 MILLION, BEFORE INCOME TAX. DIVESTED BUSINESSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE ACTIVITY RELATED TO THE SEPARATION.  TAXES.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX WAS 23%. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DIFFERED FROM THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO TAX CHARGES FROM FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT DIFFERENT RATES THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE AND THE IMPACT FROM THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL METLIFE HONG KONG, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO NON-TAXABLE INVESTMENT INCOME AND TAX CREDITS. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX WAS 22%. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DIFFERED FROM THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO TAX CHARGES FROM FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT DIFFERENT RATES THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE, A NON-DEDUCTIBLE LOSS INCURRED ON THE MARK-TO-MARKET AND DISPOSITION OF FVO BRIGHTHOUSE COMMON STOCK AND A TAX ADJUSTMENT IN CHILE. THESE TAX CHARGES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO NON-TAXABLE INVESTMENT INCOME, TAX CREDITS AND A NON-CASH TRANSFER OF ASSETS FROM A WHOLLY-OWNED U.K. INVESTMENT SUBSIDIARY TO ITS U.S. PARENT.

OVERVIEW  . ADJUSTED EARNINGS REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD DUE TO OFFSETTING VARIANCES AS DISCUSSED BELOW.  FOREIGN CURRENCY  . CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAD A $30 MILLION  NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ADJUSTED EARNINGS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD. UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, ALL AMOUNTS DISCUSSED BELOW ARE NET OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT VARIANCES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE ITEMS.  BUSINESS GROWTH.  WE BENEFITED FROM POSITIVE NET FLOWS FROM MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, WHICH INCREASED OUR INVESTED ASSET BASE. GROWTH IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS OF OUR ASIA, U.S. AND LATIN AMERICA SEGMENTS RESULTED IN HIGHER NET INVESTMENT INCOME. HOWEVER, THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN INTEREST CREDITED EXPENSES ON CERTAIN INSURANCE-RELATED LIABILITIES. HIGHER FEE INCOME IN OUR ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA SEGMENTS WAS OFFSET BY LOWER FEE INCOME IN OUR METLIFE HOLDINGS SEGMENT. A DECREASE IN EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 2019 ABATEMENT OF THE ANNUAL HEALTH INSURER FEE UNDER THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (\u201cPPACA\u201d). THE COMBINED IMPACT OF THE ITEMS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS GROWTH, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DAC AMORTIZATION, RESULTED IN A  $60 MILLION  INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EARNINGS.  MARKET FACTORS.  MARKET FACTORS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE LEVELS, VARIABILITY IN EQUITY MARKET RETURNS, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, CONTINUED TO IMPACT OUR RESULTS; HOWEVER, CERTAIN IMPACTS WERE MITIGATED BY DERIVATIVES USED TO HEDGE THESE RISKS. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN OUR NON-U.S. SEGMENTS AND CHANGES IN INFLATION RATES ON OUR INFLATION-INDEXED INVESTMENTS, INVESTMENT YIELDS INCREASED. INVESTMENT YIELDS WERE POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY HIGHER RETURNS ON PRIVATE EQUITIES AND FVO SECURITIES, AS WELL AS HIGHER PREPAYMENT FEES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER YIELDS ON FIXED INCOME SECURITIES AND LOWER INCOME FROM DERIVATIVES. IN ADDITION, LOWER EARNINGS ON OUR SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM LOWER MARGINS, DUE TO A FLATTER YIELD CURVE. HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST CREDITED RATES ON OUR DEPOSIT-TYPE LIABILITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER RATES ON OUR LONG-DURATION LIABILITIES, DROVE A NET INCREASE IN INTEREST CREDITED EXPENSES. THE CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE RESULTED IN A $24 MILLION  INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EARNINGS.  UNDERWRITING AND OTHER INSURANCE ADJUSTMENTS.  UNFAVORABLE UNDERWRITING RESULTED IN A $26 MILLION  DECREASE IN ADJUSTED EARNINGS, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LESS FAVORABLE CLAIMS EXPERIENCE IN OUR GROUP BENEFITS BUSINESS, AN INCREASE IN NON-CATASTROPHE CLAIM COSTS IN OUR PROPERTY & CASUALTY BUSINESS AND UNFAVORABLE MORTALITY, DRIVEN BY OUR METLIFE HOLDINGS SEGMENT. THIS DECLINE IN ADJUSTED EARNINGS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER CATASTROPHE-RELATED LOSSES, FAVORABLE MORTALITY IN OUR U.S. SEGMENT AND FAVORABLE MORBIDITY IN OUR METLIFE HOLDINGS SEGMENT. REFINEMENTS TO DAC AND CERTAIN INSURANCE-RELATED LIABILITIES, WHICH WERE RECORDED IN BOTH PERIODS, RESULTED IN A $31 MILLION  INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EARNINGS, PRIMARILY IN OUR U.S. SEGMENT.  EXPENSES AND TAXES.  EXPENSES INCREASED SLIGHTLY AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD, WHICH REDUCED ADJUSTED EARNINGS BY $6 MILLION. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON ADJUSTED EARNINGS WAS 19%.

FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS CAN RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT VARIANCES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE ITEMS.  110  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BUSINESS GROWTH.  WE BENEFITED FROM POSITIVE NET FLOWS FROM MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, WHICH INCREASED OUR INVESTED ASSET BASE. GROWTH IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS OF OUR U.S., ASIA, AND LATIN AMERICA SEGMENTS RESULTED IN HIGHER NET INVESTMENT INCOME. HOWEVER, THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN INTEREST CREDITED EXPENSES ON CERTAIN INSURANCE-RELATED LIABILITIES. HIGHER FEE INCOME IN OUR ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA SEGMENTS WAS OFFSET BY LOWER FEE INCOME IN OUR METLIFE HOLDINGS SEGMENT. BUSINESS GROWTH ALSO DROVE AN INCREASE IN COMMISSIONS, WHICH WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER DAC CAPITALIZATION. A DECREASE IN EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 2019 ABATEMENT OF THE ANNUAL HEALTH INSURER FEE UNDER THE PPACA. THE COMBINED IMPACT OF THE ITEMS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS GROWTH, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DAC AMORTIZATION, RESULTED IN A $138 MILLION  INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EARNINGS.  MARKET FACTORS.

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON NET INVESTMENT INCOME IN OUR NON-U.S. SEGMENTS AND CHANGES IN INFLATION RATES ON OUR INFLATION-INDEXED INVESTMENTS, INVESTMENT YIELDS INCREASED. INVESTMENT YIELDS WERE POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY HIGHER RETURNS ON FVO SECURITIES, HIGHER YIELDS ON MORTGAGE LOANS AND HIGHER PREPAYMENT FEES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INCOME FROM DERIVATIVES AND LOWER RETURNS ON REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, LOWER EARNINGS ON OUR SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM LOWER MARGINS, DUE TO A FLATTER YIELD CURVE. HIGHER INVESTMENT YIELDS WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY A NET INCREASE IN INTEREST CREDITED EXPENSES DUE TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, PERIOD OVER PERIOD, WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN OUR AVERAGE INTEREST CREDITED RATES ON DEPOSIT-TYPE LIABILITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER RATES ON LONG-DURATION LIABILITIES. THE CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DAC AMORTIZATION, RESULTED IN A $16 MILLION  DECREASE IN ADJUSTED EARNINGS.  UNDERWRITING AND OTHER INSURANCE ADJUSTMENTS.  FAVORABLE UNDERWRITING RESULTED IN A SLIGHT INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EARNINGS PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF FAVORABLE MORTALITY IN OUR U.S. SEGMENT, FAVORABLE MORBIDITY IN OUR GROUP BENEFITS BUSINESS AND LOWER CATASTROPHE LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN NON-CATASTROPHE CLAIM COSTS IN OUR PROPERTY & CASUALTY BUSINESS, UNFAVORABLE CLAIMS EXPERIENCE IN OUR ASIA SEGMENT AND UNFAVORABLE MORTALITY IN OUR METLIFE HOLDINGS AND LATIN AMERICA SEGMENTS. REFINEMENTS TO DAC AND CERTAIN INSURANCE-RELATED LIABILITIES, WHICH WERE RECORDED IN BOTH PERIODS, RESULTED IN A $33 MILLION  DECREASE IN ADJUSTED EARNINGS, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR METLIFE HOLDINGS SEGMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR U.S. SEGMENT.  INTEREST EXPENSE ON DEBT.  INTEREST EXPENSE ON DEBT DECREASED BY $45 MILLION  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXCHANGE OF SENIOR NOTES FOR BRIGHTHOUSE FINANCIAL, INC. COMMON STOCK AND THE REDEMPTION OF SENIOR NOTES FOR CASH IN 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A PREMIUM PAID IN EXCESS OF THE DEBT PRINCIPAL AND ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST REDEEMED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS.  PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS INCREASED $37 MILLION  AS A RESULT OF THE ISSUANCE OF FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES D (\u201cSERIES D PREFERRED STOCK\u201d) IN MARCH 2018 AND NON-CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES E (\u201cSERIES E PREFERRED STOCK\u201d) IN JUNE 2018.  EXPENSES.  EXPENSES INCREASED  $17 MILLION  AS A RESULT OF HIGHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CORPORATE INITIATIVES AND PROJECTS, INCLUDING THE CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN OUR UNIT COST INITIATIVE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST ON UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.

HOWEVER, CONSISTENT WITH THE GROWTH IN AVERAGE INVESTED ASSETS, INTEREST CREDITED EXPENSES ON BOTH LONG-DURATION AND DEPOSIT-TYPE LIABILITIES INCREASED. HIGHER VOLUME-RELATED AND PREMIUM TAX EXPENSES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DIRECT EXPENSES, INCLUDING CERTAIN EMPLOYEE-RELATED EXPENSES. THIS NET INCREASE IN EXPENSES, MOSTLY OFFSET BY THE DECREASE DUE TO THE 2019 ABATEMENT OF THE ANNUAL HEALTH INSURER FEE UNDER THE PPACA, WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN PREMIUMS, FEES AND OTHER REVENUES.

THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PREPAYMENT FEES AND HIGHER YIELDS ON MORTGAGE LOANS AND PRIVATE EQUITIES. HOWEVER, NET INVESTMENT INCOME INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM THE IMPACT OF AN INCREASED CREDITING RATE ON INTEREST ON ECONOMIC CAPITAL. HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST CREDITED RATES ON OUR DEPOSIT-TYPE LIABILITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER RATES ON OUR LONG-DURATION LIABILITIES, DROVE A NET INCREASE IN INTEREST CREDITED EXPENSES.

IN OUR PROPERTY & CASUALTY BUSINESS, LOWER CATASTROPHE-RELATED LOSSES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NON-CATASTROPHE CLAIM COSTS, WHICH RESULTED IN A $7 MILLION INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EARNINGS. NON-CATASTROPHE CLAIM COSTS WERE DRIVEN BY HIGHER SEVERITIES AND FREQUENCIES IN BOTH OUR AUTO AND HOMEOWNER BUSINESSES.

WE MONITOR OUR MORTGAGE LOAN INVESTMENTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS, INCLUDING A REVIEW OF LOANS THAT ARE CURRENT, PAST DUE, RESTRUCTURED AND UNDER FORECLOSURE. SEE NOTE  6  OF THE NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORTGAGE LOANS BY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATOR, PAST DUE AND NONACCRUAL MORTGAGE LOANS, IMPAIRED MORTGAGE LOANS, AND CARRYING VALUE OF FORECLOSED MORTGAGE LOANS.  132  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE REVIEW OUR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THESE REVIEWS MAY INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROPERTY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RENT ROLL, LEASE ROLLOVER ANALYSIS, PROPERTY INSPECTIONS, MARKET ANALYSIS, ESTIMATED VALUATIONS OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS, DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIOS AND TENANT CREDITWORTHINESS. THE MONITORING PROCESS FOCUSES ON HIGHER RISK LOANS, WHICH INCLUDE THOSE THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS RESTRUCTURED, DELINQUENT OR IN FORECLOSURE, AS WELL AS LOANS WITH HIGHER LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS AND LOWER DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIOS. THE MONITORING PROCESS FOR AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE LOANS IS GENERALLY SIMILAR, WITH A FOCUS ON HIGHER RISK LOANS, SUCH AS LOANS WITH HIGHER LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS, INCLUDING REVIEWS ON A GEOGRAPHIC AND SECTOR BASIS. WE REVIEW OUR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. SEE NOTE 8 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT FOR INFORMATION ON OUR EVALUATION OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY.  LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS AND DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIOS ARE COMMON MEASURES IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALITY OF COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS ARE A COMMON MEASURE IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALITY OF AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE LOANS. LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS COMPARE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOAN TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. A LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO GREATER THAN 100% INDICATES THAT THE LOAN AMOUNT IS GREATER THAN THE COLLATERAL VALUE. A LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO OF LESS THAN 100% INDICATES AN EXCESS OF COLLATERAL VALUE OVER THE LOAN AMOUNT. GENERALLY, THE HIGHER THE LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO, THE HIGHER THE RISK OF EXPERIENCING A CREDIT LOSS. THE DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO COMPARES A PROPERTY\u2019S NET OPERATING INCOME TO AMOUNTS NEEDED TO SERVICE THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST DUE UNDER THE LOAN. GENERALLY, THE LOWER THE DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO, THE HIGHER THE RISK OF EXPERIENCING A CREDIT LOSS. FOR OUR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, OUR AVERAGE LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO WAS  55%  AT BOTH  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND OUR AVERAGE DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO WAS  2.4X  AND  2.5X  FOR  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO, AS WELL AS THE VALUES UTILIZED IN CALCULATING THE RATIO, IS UPDATED ANNUALLY, ON A ROLLING BASIS, WITH A PORTION OF THE PORTFOLIO UPDATED EACH QUARTER. IN ADDITION, THE LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO IS ROUTINELY UPDATED FOR ALL BUT THE LOWEST RISK LOANS AS PART OF OUR ONGOING REVIEW OF OUR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIO. FOR OUR AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE LOANS, OUR AVERAGE LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO WAS  46%  AT BOTH  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THE VALUES UTILIZED IN CALCULATING THE AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE LOAN LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO ARE DEVELOPED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ONGOING REVIEW OF THE AGRICULTURAL LOAN PORTFOLIO AND ARE ROUTINELY UPDATED.  MORTGAGE LOAN VALUATION ALLOWANCES.  OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED BOTH ON A LOAN SPECIFIC BASIS FOR THOSE LOANS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHERE A PROPERTY SPECIFIC OR MARKET SPECIFIC RISK HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT COULD LIKELY RESULT IN A FUTURE LOSS, AS WELL AS FOR POOLS OF LOANS WITH SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS WHERE A PROPERTY SPECIFIC OR MARKET SPECIFIC RISK HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED, BUT FOR WHICH WE EXPECT TO INCUR A LOSS. ACCORDINGLY, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS PROVIDED TO ABSORB THESE ESTIMATED PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES.  THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES IS BASED UPON OUR PERIODIC EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT OF KNOWN AND INHERENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR LOAN PORTFOLIOS. SUCH EVALUATIONS AND ASSESSMENTS ARE BASED UPON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR EXPERIENCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, DEFAULTS AND LOSS SEVERITY, AND LOSS EXPECTATIONS FOR LOANS WITH SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS. THESE EVALUATIONS AND ASSESSMENTS ARE REVISED AS CONDITIONS CHANGE AND NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, WHICH CAN CAUSE THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES TO INCREASE OR DECREASE OVER TIME AS SUCH EVALUATIONS ARE REVISED. NEGATIVE CREDIT MIGRATION, INCLUDING AN ACTUAL OR EXPECTED INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF PROBLEM LOANS, WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE. POSITIVE CREDIT MIGRATION, INCLUDING AN ACTUAL OR EXPECTED DECREASE IN THE LEVEL OF PROBLEM LOANS, WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  SEE NOTE  6  OF THE NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT HOW VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED AND MONITORED, AND ACTIVITY IN AND BALANCES OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE, AS OF AND FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018.

WE DIVERSIFY OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS BY BOTH GEOGRAPHIC REGION AND PROPERTY TYPE TO REDUCE RISK OF CONCENTRATION. THE CARRYING VALUE OF REAL ESTATE AND REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURES WAS  $10.3 BILLION  AND  $9.7 BILLION  , OR  2.2%  AND  2.1%  OF CASH AND INVESTED ASSETS, AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY  SEE NOTE  8  OF THE NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DERIVATIVES MEASURED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND THEIR CORRESPONDING FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.  THE VALUATION OF LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES INVOLVES THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND GENERALLY REQUIRES A HIGHER DEGREE OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT OR ESTIMATION THAN THE VALUATIONS OF LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES. ALTHOUGH LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE UNOBSERVABLE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE WHEN PRICING SUCH INSTRUMENTS AND ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE USE OF DIFFERENT INPUTS OR METHODOLOGIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT NET INCOME.  DERIVATIVES CATEGORIZED AS LEVEL 3 AT  JUNE 30, 2019  INCLUDE: INTEREST RATE FORWARDS WITH MATURITIES WHICH EXTEND BEYOND THE OBSERVABLE PORTION OF THE YIELD CURVE; INTEREST RATE TOTAL RETURN SWAPS WITH UNOBSERVABLE REPURCHASE RATES; FOREIGN CURRENCY SWAPS AND FORWARDS WITH CERTAIN UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, INCLUDING THE UNOBSERVABLE PORTION OF THE YIELD CURVE; CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS PRICED USING UNOBSERVABLE CREDIT SPREADS, OR THAT ARE PRICED THROUGH INDEPENDENT BROKER QUOTATIONS; EQUITY VARIANCE SWAPS WITH UNOBSERVABLE VOLATILITY INPUTS; AND EQUITY INDEX OPTIONS WITH UNOBSERVABLE CORRELATION INPUTS. AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , LESS THAN 1% OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVES WAS PRICED THROUGH INDEPENDENT BROKER QUOTATIONS.

THE FAVORABLE CHANGES IN NET GAINS (LOSSES) ON WRITTEN CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS OF $85 MILLION AND $265 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WERE DUE TO CERTAIN CREDIT SPREADS ON CERTAIN CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS USED AS REPLICATIONS NARROWING IN THE CURRENT PERIODS AS COMPARED TO WIDENING IN THE PRIOR PERIODS.  THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT AT RISK RELATED TO OUR WRITTEN CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS IS EQUAL TO THE CORRESPONDING GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNT. IN A REPLICATION TRANSACTION, WE PAIR AN ASSET ON OUR BALANCE SHEET WITH A WRITTEN CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP TO SYNTHETICALLY REPLICATE A CORPORATE BOND, A CORE ASSET HOLDING OF LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES. REPLICATIONS ARE ENTERED INTO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDELINES APPROVED BY STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS AND THE NAIC AND ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN MANAGING THE OVERALL CORPORATE CREDIT RISK WITHIN THE COMPANY. IN ORDER TO MATCH OUR LONG-DATED INSURANCE LIABILITIES, WE SEEK TO BUY LONG-DATED CORPORATE BONDS. IN SOME INSTANCES, THESE MAY NOT BE READILY AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET, OR THEY MAY BE ISSUED BY CORPORATIONS TO WHICH WE ALREADY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE CREDIT EXPOSURE. FOR EXAMPLE, BY PURCHASING TREASURY BONDS (OR OTHER HIGH-QUALITY ASSETS) AND ASSOCIATING THEM WITH WRITTEN CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS ON THE DESIRED CORPORATE CREDIT NAME, WE CAN REPLICATE THE DESIRED BOND EXPOSURES AND MEET OUR ALM NEEDS. IN ADDITION, GIVEN THE SHORTER TENOR OF THE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS (GENERALLY FIVE-YEAR TENORS) VERSUS A LONG DATED CORPORATE BOND, WE HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN MANAGING OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES.

DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING RISKS AND THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DETERMINATION OF ACTUARIAL LIABILITIES, WE CANNOT PRECISELY DETERMINE THE AMOUNTS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE PAID WITH RESPECT TO THESE ACTUARIAL LIABILITIES, AND THE ULTIMATE AMOUNTS MAY VARY FROM THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS, PARTICULARLY WHEN PAYMENTS MAY NOT OCCUR UNTIL WELL INTO THE FUTURE.  WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR ESTIMATES OF ACTUARIAL LIABILITIES FOR FUTURE BENEFITS AND COMPARE THEM WITH OUR ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. WE REVISE ESTIMATES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED OR REQUIRED UNDER GAAP, IF WE DETERMINE THAT FUTURE EXPECTED EXPERIENCE DIFFERS FROM ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACTUARIAL LIABILITIES. WE CHARGE OR CREDIT CHANGES IN OUR LIABILITIES TO EXPENSES IN THE PERIOD THE LIABILITIES ARE ESTABLISHED OR RE-ESTIMATED. IF THE LIABILITIES ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED FOR FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS PROVE INADEQUATE, WE MUST INCREASE THEM. SUCH AN INCREASE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  WE HAVE EXPERIENCED, AND WILL LIKELY IN THE FUTURE EXPERIENCE, CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND POSSIBLY ACTS OF TERRORISM, AS WELL AS TURBULENT FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. DUE TO THEIR NATURE, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE INCIDENCE, TIMING, SEVERITY OR AMOUNT OF LOSSES FROM CATASTROPHES AND ACTS OF TERRORISM, BUT WE MAKE BROAD USE OF CATASTROPHIC AND NON-CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE TO MANAGE RISK FROM THESE PERILS.

U.S.  AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE COMPRISED OF GROUP INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES, AS WELL AS PROPERTY AND CASUALTY POLICIES. FOR GROUP INSURANCE, FUTURE POLICYHOLDER BENEFITS ARE COMPRISED MAINLY OF LIABILITIES FOR DISABLED LIVES UNDER DISABILITY WAIVER OF PREMIUM POLICY PROVISIONS, LIABILITIES FOR SURVIVOR INCOME BENEFIT INSURANCE, ACTIVE LIFE POLICIES AND PREMIUM STABILIZATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCY LIABILITIES HELD UNDER LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS. FOR GROUP ANNUITY CONTRACTS, FUTURE POLICYHOLDER BENEFITS ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO PAYOUT ANNUITIES, INCLUDING PENSION RISK TRANSFERS, STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT ANNUITIES AND INSTITUTIONAL INCOME ANNUITIES. THERE IS NO INTEREST RATE CREDITING FLEXIBILITY ON THESE LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, A SUSTAINED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT EARNINGS; HOWEVER, WE MITIGATE OUR RISKS BY APPLYING VARIOUS ALM STRATEGIES, INCLUDING THE USE OF VARIOUS INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE POSITIONS. THE COMPONENTS OF FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS RELATED TO OUR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY POLICIES ARE LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID CLAIMS, ESTIMATED BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS RATES OF CLAIM FREQUENCIES, LEVELS OF SEVERITIES, INFLATION, JUDICIAL TRENDS, LEGISLATIVE CHANGES OR REGULATORY DECISIONS. ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TO LOSSES FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, AND WE CONSIDER THE EFFECTS OF CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS, ANTICIPATED TRENDS AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, REDUCED FOR ANTICIPATED SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION.  ASIA  FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE HELD PRIMARILY FOR TRADITIONAL LIFE, ENDOWMENT, ANNUITY AND ACCIDENT & HEALTH CONTRACTS. THEY ARE ALSO HELD FOR TOTAL RETURN PASS-THROUGH PROVISIONS INCLUDED IN CERTAIN UNIVERSAL LIFE AND SAVINGS PRODUCTS.

FACTORS IMPACTING THESE LIABILITIES INCLUDE SUSTAINED PERIODS OF YIELDS LOWER THAN EXPECTED, LOWER THAN EXPECTED ASSET REINVESTMENT RATES, MARKET VOLATILITY, ACTUAL LAPSES RESULTING IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED INCOME, AND ACTUAL MORTALITY OR MORBIDITY RESULTING IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS. WE MITIGATE OUR RISKS BY APPLYING VARIOUS ALM STRATEGIES AND BY THE USE OF REINSURANCE.  LATIN AMERICA  FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE HELD PRIMARILY FOR IMMEDIATE ANNUITIES IN CHILE, ARGENTINA AND MEXICO AND TRADITIONAL LIFE CONTRACTS MAINLY IN MEXICO, BRAZIL AND COLOMBIA. THERE ARE ALSO LIABILITIES HELD FOR TOTAL RETURN PASS-THROUGH PROVISIONS INCLUDED IN CERTAIN UNIVERSAL LIFE AND SAVINGS PRODUCTS IN MEXICO. THERE IS LIMITED INTEREST RATE CREDITING FLEXIBILITY ON THE IMMEDIATE ANNUITY AND TRADITIONAL LIFE LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, SUSTAINED PERIODS OF YIELDS LOWER THAN EXPECTED COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT EARNINGS; HOWEVER, WE MITIGATE OUR RISKS BY APPLYING VARIOUS ALM STRATEGIES. OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING THESE LIABILITIES ARE ACTUAL MORTALITY RESULTING IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND ACTUAL LAPSES RESULTING IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED INCOME.  EMEA  FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS FOR THIS SEGMENT INCLUDE UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVES FOR GROUP LIFE AND CREDIT INSURANCE CONTRACTS.

WE MITIGATE OUR RISKS BY HAVING PREMIUMS WHICH ARE ADJUSTABLE OR CANCELLABLE IN SOME CASES, APPLYING VARIOUS ALM STRATEGIES AND BY THE USE OF REINSURANCE.  139  TABLE OF CONTENTS  METLIFE HOLDINGS  FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS FOR THE LIFE BUSINESS ARE COMPRISED MAINLY OF LIABILITIES FOR TRADITIONAL LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS. IN ORDER TO MANAGE RISK, WE HAVE OFTEN REINSURED A PORTION OF THE MORTALITY RISK ON LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES. WE ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR REINSURANCE PROGRAMS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN INCREASES OR DECREASES TO EXISTING COVERAGE. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO VARIOUS INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE POSITIONS TO MITIGATE THE RISK THAT INVESTMENT OF PREMIUMS RECEIVED AND REINVESTMENT OF MATURING ASSETS OVER THE LIFE OF THE POLICY WILL BE AT RATES BELOW THOSE ASSUMED IN THE ORIGINAL PRICING OF THESE CONTRACTS. FOR THE ANNUITIES BUSINESS, FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS ARE COMPRISED MAINLY OF LIABILITIES FOR LIFE-CONTINGENT INCOME ANNUITIES AND LIABILITIES FOR THE VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEED MINIMUM BENEFITS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS INSURANCE.

IN ADDITION, FOR OUR OTHER PRODUCTS, FUTURE POLICYHOLDER BENEFITS RELATED TO THE REINSURANCE OF OUR FORMER JAPAN JOINT VENTURE ARE COMPRISED OF LIABILITIES FOR THE VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEED MINIMUM BENEFITS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS INSURANCE.  CORPORATE & OTHER  FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS PRIMARILY INCLUDE LIABILITIES FOR OTHER REINSURANCE BUSINESS.

A SUSTAINED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT LIABILITIES AND EARNINGS AS A RESULT OF THE MINIMUM CREDITED RATE GUARANTEES PRESENT IN MOST OF THESE POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES. WE MITIGATE OUR RISKS BY APPLYING VARIOUS ALM STRATEGIES AND WITH REINSURANCE.

SOME OF THE DEFERRED ANNUITIES IN BRAZIL ARE UNIT-LINKED INVESTMENTS THAT DO NOT MEET THE GAAP DEFINITION OF SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. LIABILITIES FOR UNIT-LINKED INVESTMENTS ARE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSOCIATED INVESTMENTS, AS THE RETURN ON ASSETS IS GENERALLY PASSED DIRECTLY TO THE POLICYHOLDER. MANY OF THE OTHER LIABILITIES HAVE MINIMUM CREDITED RATE GUARANTEES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT LIABILITIES AND EARNINGS IN A SUSTAINED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT.  EMEA  POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES IN THIS SEGMENT ARE HELD MOSTLY FOR UNIVERSAL LIFE, DEFERRED ANNUITY, PENSION PRODUCTS, AND UNIT-LINKED INVESTMENTS THAT DO NOT MEET THE GAAP DEFINITION OF SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. THEY ARE ALSO HELD FOR ENDOWMENT PRODUCTS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY RISK.

IN SOME CASES, THE BENEFIT BASE MAY BE INCREASED BY ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS, BONUS AMOUNTS, ACCRUALS OR OPTIONAL MARKET VALUE RESETS. SEE NOTE  4  OF THE NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS NOTES 1 AND 4 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  CERTAIN GUARANTEES, INCLUDING PORTIONS THEREOF, HAVE INSURANCE LIABILITIES ESTABLISHED THAT ARE INCLUDED IN FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS. GUARANTEES ACCOUNTED FOR IN THIS MANNER INCLUDE GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH BENEFITS (\u201cGMDBS\u201d), THE LIFE-CONTINGENT PORTION OF GUARANTEED MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL BENEFITS (\u201cGMWBS\u201d), ELECTIVE GUARANTEED MINIMUM INCOME BENEFIT (\u201cGMIB\u201d) ANNUITIZATIONS, AND THE LIFE CONTINGENT PORTION OF GMIBS THAT REQUIRE ANNUITIZATION WHEN THE ACCOUNT BALANCE GOES TO ZERO. THESE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRUED OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT IN PROPORTION TO ACTUAL AND FUTURE EXPECTED POLICY ASSESSMENTS BASED ON THE LEVEL OF GUARANTEED MINIMUM BENEFITS GENERATED USING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS OF SEPARATE ACCOUNT RETURNS. THE SCENARIOS ARE BASED ON BEST ESTIMATE ASSUMPTIONS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE USED TO AMORTIZE DAC. WHEN CURRENT ESTIMATES OF FUTURE BENEFITS EXCEED THOSE PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED OR WHEN CURRENT ESTIMATES OF FUTURE ASSESSMENTS ARE LOWER THAN THOSE PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED, LIABILITIES WILL INCREASE, RESULTING IN A CURRENT PERIOD CHARGE TO NET INCOME. THE OPPOSITE RESULT OCCURS WHEN THE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF FUTURE BENEFITS ARE LOWER THAN THOSE PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED OR WHEN CURRENT ESTIMATES OF FUTURE ASSESSMENTS EXCEED THOSE PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED. AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD, WE UPDATE THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF BUSINESS REMAINING IN-FORCE, WHICH IMPACTS EXPECTED FUTURE ASSESSMENTS AND THE PROJECTION OF ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFITS RESULTING IN A CURRENT PERIOD CHARGE OR INCREASE TO EARNINGS.  CERTAIN GUARANTEES, INCLUDING PORTIONS THEREOF, ACCOUNTED FOR AS EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, ARE RECORDED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND INCLUDED IN POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES. GUARANTEES ACCOUNTED FOR AS EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES INCLUDE GUARANTEED MINIMUM ACCUMULATION BENEFITS (\u201cGMABS\u201d), THE NON-LIFE CONTINGENT PORTION OF GMWBS AND CERTAIN NON-LIFE CONTINGENT PORTIONS OF GMIBS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF GUARANTEES ACCOUNTED FOR AS EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF PROJECTED FUTURE BENEFITS MINUS THE PRESENT VALUE OF PROJECTED FUTURE FEES. THE PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE BENEFITS AND FUTURE FEES REQUIRE CAPITAL MARKET AND ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING EXPECTATIONS CONCERNING POLICYHOLDER BEHAVIOR. A RISK-NEUTRAL VALUATION METHODOLOGY IS USED TO PROJECT THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE GUARANTEES UNDER MULTIPLE CAPITAL MARKET SCENARIOS TO DETERMINE AN ECONOMIC LIABILITY. THE REPORTED ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IS THEN DETERMINED BY TAKING THE PRESENT VALUE OF THESE RISK-FREE GENERATED CASH FLOWS USING A DISCOUNT RATE THAT INCORPORATES A SPREAD OVER THE RISK-FREE RATE TO REFLECT OUR NONPERFORMANCE RISK AND ADDING A RISK MARGIN. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE DETERMINATION OF ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, SEE NOTE  8  OF THE NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  142  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE CARRYING VALUE FOR GUARANTEES AT.

THESE NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENTS REPRESENT THE IMPACT OF INCLUDING A CREDIT SPREAD WHEN DISCOUNTING THE UNDERLYING RISK-NEUTRAL CASH FLOWS TO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES. THE NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENT DOES NOT HAVE AN ECONOMIC IMPACT ON US AS IT CANNOT BE MONETIZED GIVEN THE NATURE OF THESE POLICYHOLDER LIABILITIES. THE CHANGE IN VALUATION ARISING FROM THE NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENT IS NOT HEDGED.  THE CARRYING VALUES OF THESE GUARANTEES CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY DURING PERIODS OF SIZABLE AND SUSTAINED SHIFTS IN EQUITY MARKET PERFORMANCE, EQUITY VOLATILITY, INTEREST RATES OR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. CARRYING VALUES ARE ALSO IMPACTED BY OUR ASSUMPTIONS AROUND MORTALITY, SEPARATE ACCOUNT RETURNS AND POLICYHOLDER BEHAVIOR, INCLUDING LAPSE RATES.

WITHIN EACH TYPE OF GUARANTEE, THERE IS A RANGE OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS REFLECTING THE CHANGING NATURE OF THESE PRODUCTS OVER TIME. CHANGES IN PRODUCT FEATURES AND TERMS ARE IN PART DRIVEN BY CUSTOMER DEMAND BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, REFLECT OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES OF CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATING THE GUARANTEED BENEFITS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED ASSET-LIABILITY MATCHING.

IN TERMS OF TOTAL ACCOUNT VALUE, GMIBS ARE OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT LIVING BENEFIT GUARANTEE. OUR PRIMARY RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR OUR GMIB PRODUCTS IS OUR DERIVATIVES HEDGING PROGRAM AS DISCUSSED BELOW. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ENGAGED IN CERTAIN REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS COVERING SOME OF OUR GMIB BUSINESS. AS PART OF OUR OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH FOR LIVING BENEFIT GUARANTEES, WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE REINSURANCE MARKETS FOR THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL COVERAGE FOR OUR GMIB BUSINESS. WE STOPPED SELLING GMIBS IN FEBRUARY 2016.  144  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS OUR GMIB ASSOCIATED TOTAL ACCOUNT VALUES, BY THEIR GUARANTEED PAYOUT BASIS, AT  JUNE 30, 2019  .

ADDITIONALLY, 42% OF THE $21.8 BILLION OF GMIB TOTAL ACCOUNT VALUE HAS BEEN INVESTED IN MANAGED VOLATILITY FUNDS AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  . THESE FUNDS SEEK TO MANAGE VOLATILITY BY ADJUSTING THE FUND HOLDINGS WITHIN CERTAIN GUIDELINES BASED ON CAPITAL MARKET MOVEMENTS. SUCH ACTIVITY REDUCES THE OVERALL RISK OF THE UNDERLYING FUNDS WHILE MAINTAINING THEIR GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. THESE RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR US TO MANAGE THE FUNDS\u2019 VOLATILITY THROUGH HEDGING OR REINSURANCE.  OUR GMIB PRODUCTS TYPICALLY HAVE A WAITING PERIOD OF 10 YEARS TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR ANNUITIZATION. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , ONLY 20% OF OUR CONTRACTS WITH GMIBS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR ANNUITIZATION. THE REMAINING CONTRACTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ANNUITIZATION FOR AN AVERAGE OF FOUR YEARS.  ONCE ELIGIBLE FOR ANNUITIZATION, CONTRACTHOLDERS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO ANNUITIZE ONLY IF THEIR CONTRACTS WERE IN-THE-MONEY. WE CALCULATE IN-THE-MONEYNESS WITH RESPECT TO GMIBS CONSISTENT WITH NET AMOUNT AT RISK AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  4  OF THE NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BY COMPARING THE CONTRACTHOLDERS\u2019 INCOME BENEFITS BASED ON TOTAL ACCOUNT VALUES AND CURRENT ANNUITY RATES VERSUS THE GUARANTEED INCOME BENEFITS. THE NET AMOUNT AT RISK WAS $449 MILLION AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , OF WHICH $375 MILLION WAS RELATED TO GMIBS.

OUR HEDGING STRATEGY INVOLVES THE SIGNIFICANT USE OF STATIC LONGER-TERM DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO AVOID THE NEED TO EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS DURING PERIODS OF MARKET DISRUPTION OR HIGHER VOLATILITY. WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE CAPITAL MARKETS FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO ADJUST OUR LIABILITY COVERAGE, AS APPROPRIATE. FUTURES ARE ALSO USED TO DYNAMICALLY ADJUST THE DAILY COVERAGE LEVELS AS MARKETS AND LIABILITY EXPOSURES FLUCTUATE.  WE REMAIN LIABLE FOR THE GUARANTEED BENEFITS IN THE EVENT THAT REINSURERS OR DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY. CERTAIN OF OUR REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE COLLATERALIZED AND DERIVATIVES POSITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS, BOTH OF WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE EXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTY RISK. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT HEDGING AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIONS PROVE INEFFECTIVE OR THAT UNANTICIPATED POLICYHOLDER BEHAVIOR OR MORTALITY, COMBINED WITH ADVERSE MARKET EVENTS, PRODUCES ECONOMIC LOSSES BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES EMPLOYED.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OVERVIEW  OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY GENERALLY. STRESSED CONDITIONS, VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTIONS IN GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS, PARTICULAR MARKETS, OR FINANCIAL ASSET CLASSES CAN HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US, IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVE A LARGE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND OUR INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGING MARKET FACTORS. CHANGING CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY MAY AFFECT OUR FINANCING COSTS AND MARKET INTEREST FOR OUR DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING MARKET FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL NEEDS, SEE \u201c\u2014 INDUSTRY TRENDS\u201d AND \u201c\u2014 INVESTMENTS \u2014 CURRENT ENVIRONMENT.\u201d  LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT  BASED UPON THE STRENGTH OF OUR FRANCHISE, DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR BUSINESSES, STRONG FINANCIAL FUNDAMENTALS AND THE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING SOURCES AVAILABLE TO US AS DESCRIBED HEREIN, WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE WE HAVE ACCESS TO AMPLE LIQUIDITY TO MEET BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS UNDER CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND REASONABLY POSSIBLE STRESS SCENARIOS. WE CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR AND ADJUST OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL PLANS FOR METLIFE, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES IN LIGHT OF MARKET CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGING NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES.  146  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY  WE MAINTAIN A SUBSTANTIAL SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY POSITION, WHICH WAS $12.0 BILLION AND $11.1 BILLION AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  WE HAVE ESTABLISHED SEVERAL SENIOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PROCESS. THESE COMMITTEES, INCLUDING THE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE AND THE ENTERPRISE RISK COMMITTEE (\u201cERC\u201d), REGULARLY REVIEW ACTUAL AND PROJECTED CAPITAL LEVELS (UNDER A VARIETY OF SCENARIOS INCLUDING STRESS SCENARIOS) AND OUR ANNUAL CAPITAL PLAN IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR CAPITAL POLICY. THE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE IS COMPRISED OF MEMBERS OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING METLIFE, INC.\u2019S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (\u201cCFO\u201d), TREASURER, AND CHIEF RISK OFFICER (\u201cCRO\u201d).

THESE AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES INCLUDE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, SALES OF LIQUID ASSETS, GLOBAL FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDING COMMERCIAL PAPER AND VARIOUS CREDIT AND COMMITTED FACILITIES.  CAPITAL  WE MANAGE OUR CAPITAL POSITION TO MAINTAIN OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CREDIT RATINGS.

SEE \u201c\u2014 ECONOMIC CAPITAL.\u201d ALLOCATED EQUITY EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OTHER THAN FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS.  THE ABOVE MEASURE REPRESENTS A LEVEL OF EQUITY CONSISTENT WITH THE VIEW THAT, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE DO NOT PLAN TO SELL MOST INVESTMENTS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF REALIZING GAINS OR LOSSES. ALSO, REFER TO THE UTILIZATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS AND OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES BASED ON ADJUSTED EARNINGS MENTIONED ABOVE.  THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS RELEVANT TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PERFORMANCE RESULTS.  \u2022  WE SOMETIMES REFER TO SALES ACTIVITY FOR VARIOUS PRODUCTS.

WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ASYMMETRICAL AND NON-ECONOMIC ACCOUNTING FROM TOTAL GAAP RESULTS ENHANCES INVESTOR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PERFORMANCE BY DISCLOSING HOW THESE ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AFFECT REPORTED GAAP RESULTS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY USES A MEASURE OF FREE CASH FLOW TO FACILITATE AN UNDERSTANDING OF ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FOR REINVESTMENT INTO ITS BUSINESSES OR USE IN NON-MANDATORY CAPITAL ACTIONS. THE COMPANY DEFINES FREE CASH FLOW AS THE SUM OF CASH AVAILABLE AT METLIFE\u2019S HOLDING COMPANIES FROM DIVIDENDS FROM OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, EXPENSES AND OTHER NET FLOWS OF THE HOLDING COMPANIES (INCLUDING CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO SUBSIDIARIES), AND NET CONTRIBUTIONS FROM DEBT TO BE AT OR BELOW TARGET LEVERAGE RATIOS. THIS MEASURE OF FREE CASH FLOW IS PRIOR TO CAPITAL ACTIONS, SUCH AS COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASES, DEBT REDUCTION AND MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. FREE CASH FLOW SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING ACTIVITIES CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE FREE CASH FLOW RATIO IS TYPICALLY EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF ANNUAL ADJUSTED EARNINGS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  , WERE  $183.6 MILLION  AND  $179.2 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $12.6 MILLION OF EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED EXPENSES AT BIOREFERENCE DUE TO PLANNED COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  , INCLUDE EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF  $5.5 MILLION  AND  $7.8 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.

THE CHANGE IN CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE TIMING OF ACHIEVEMENT OF FUTURE MILESTONES FOR OPKO RENAL AND OPKO DIAGNOSTICS.  THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES AT  JUNE 30, 2019  RELATE TO POTENTIAL AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO FORMER STOCKHOLDERS OF CURNA, OPKO DIAGNOSTICS AND OPKO RENAL PURSUANT TO OUR ACQUISITION AGREEMENTS IN JANUARY 2011, OCTOBER 2011 AND MARCH 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

UPON OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL BY THE U.S. FDA, THE IPR&D ASSETS WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET AND AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER ITS ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.  ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES  .  ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE $0.7 MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND IS RELATED TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO WRITE DOWN OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS AT FINETECH DOWN TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN TESTING GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IPR&D, FOR IMPAIRMENT ARE CONSISTENT WITH ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN THEIR ESTIMATES.  HOWEVER, IF ACTUAL RESULTS ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE THAT COULD BE MATERIAL.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN APPROPRIATE REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR  4KSCORE  TEST AND EXPERIENCE SUSTAINED DECLINES IN OPERATING RESULTS AT BIOREFERENCE, OUR ESTIMATES OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE BIOREFERENCE REPORTING UNIT MAY CHANGE.  IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT FALLS BELOW CARRYING VALUE, WE WOULD RECORD IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AT BIOREFERENCE AND SUCH IMPAIRMENT COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.  THE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT FOR HGH-CTP HAS EXCEEDED OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATES AND WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES BEYOND OUR ESTIMATES AND THE AGREED DEVELOPMENT CAP.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH PFIZER REGARDING COST SHARING FOR OVERRUNS, AS WELL AS OTHER OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT OBLIGATIONS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE EXPECTED BENEFITS OF THE PFIZER TRANSACTION. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP HGH-CTP, OR CHANGES IN PROJECTIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FORECAST OF NET CASH FLOWS, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO THE IPR&D FOR HGH-CTP.

FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , THE TAX RATE DIFFERED FROM THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF  21%  PRIMARILY DUE TO  THE RELATIVE MIX IN EARNINGS AND LOSSES IN THE U.S. VERSUS FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS AND THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN DISCRETE TAX EVENTS AND OPERATING RESULTS IN TAX JURISDICTIONS WHICH DO NOT RESULT IN A TAX BENEFIT.  LOSS FROM INVESTMENTS IN INVESTEES  .  WE HAVE MADE INVESTMENTS IN OTHER EARLY STAGE COMPANIES THAT WE PERCEIVE TO HAVE VALUABLE PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AND SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL TO CREATE VALUE FOR US AS A SHAREHOLDER OR MEMBER.  WE ACCOUNT FOR THESE INVESTMENTS UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, RESULTING IN THE RECORDING OF OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THEIR LOSSES UNTIL OUR SHARE OF THEIR LOSS EXCEEDS OUR INVESTMENT.  UNTIL THE INVESTEES\u2019 TECHNOLOGIES ARE COMMERCIALIZED, IF EVER, WE ANTICIPATE THEY WILL REPORT A NET LOSS.

PFIZER AGREED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS AS WELL AS ALL POST-MARKETING STUDIES.  IN ADDITION, PFIZER AGREED TO FUND THE COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES FOR ALL INDICATIONS AND LEAD THE MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES COVERED BY THE GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN.  THE AGREEMENT OBLIGATED US TO FUND DEVELOPMENT UP TO AN AGREED CAP  IN DECEMBER 2016, WE ANNOUNCED PRELIMINARY TOPLINE DATA FROM OUR PHASE 3, DOUBLE BLIND, PLACEBO CONTROLLED STUDY OF HGH-CTP IN ADULTS WITH GHD.  ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HGH-CTP AND PLACEBO ON THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT OF CHANGE IN TRUNK FAT MASS FROM BASELINE TO 26 WEEKS, AFTER UNBLINDING THE STUDY, WE IDENTIFIED AN EXCEPTIONAL VALUE OF TRUNK FAT MASS REDUCTION IN THE PLACEBO GROUP THAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED THE PRIMARY OUTCOME.  WE HAVE COMPLETED POST-HOC SENSITIVITY ANALYSES TO EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF OUTLIERS ON THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT RESULTS USING MULTIPLE STATISTICAL APPROACHES.  ANALYSES THAT EXCLUDED OUTLIERS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HGH-CTP AND PLACEBO ON THE CHANGE IN TRUNK FAT MASS.  ADDITIONAL ANALYSES THAT DID NOT EXCLUDE OUTLIERS SHOWED MIXED RESULTS.  FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE ANALYSES, OPKO AND PFIZER AGREED THAT OPKO MAY PROCEED TO DISCUSS A POSSIBLE BLA SUBMISSION WITH THE FDA.  WE BELIEVE THERE IS A PATH FOR SUBMISSION IN WHICH THE FDA MAY ASSESS THE TOTALITY OF THE DATA, INCLUDING ALL RELEVANT EFFICACY AND SAFETY DATA IN ADULT AND PEDIATRIC PATIENTS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE REGULATORY STRATEGY FOR THE ADULT INDICATION GOING FORWARD, INCLUDING THE TIMING OF A POSSIBLE SUBMISSION.  IN AUGUST 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD COMPLETED ENROLLMENT IN A GLOBAL PHASE 3 STUDY OF HGH-CTP IN GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENT CHILDREN.  THE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT FOR HGH-CTP HAS EXCEEDED OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATES AND WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES BEYOND OUR ESTIMATES AND THE AGREED DEVELOPMENT CAP.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH PFIZER REGARDING COST SHARING FOR OVERRUNS, AS WELL AS OTHER OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT OBLIGATIONS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE EXPECTED BENEFITS OF THE PFIZER TRANSACTION AND OUR OVERALL FINANCIAL CONDITION.  IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP HGH- CTP AND/OR PFIZER INC. WERE TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT OR NOT SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZE HGH-CTP FOR ANY REASON, OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  WE ARE CONSTRUCTING A RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING CENTER IN WATERFORD, IRELAND, FOR WHICH WE WILL INCUR BETWEEN $40 MILLION AND $50 MILLION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND VALIDATION OF THE FACILITY.  CONSTRUCTION OF THE FACILITY BEGAN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016 WITH EXPECTED COMPLETION IN 2019.  CURRENTLY, WE PLAN TO FUND THE PROJECT FROM CASH ON HAND OR FROM THIRD PARTY FUNDING SOURCES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO US. THROUGH  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE CUMULATIVE EXPENDITURES WE INCURRED TO DATE ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FACILITY WAS APPROXIMATELY $39.9 MILLION.  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS OF CURNA, OPKO DIAGNOSTICS AND OPKO RENAL, WE AGREED TO PAY FUTURE CONSIDERATION TO THE SELLERS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN EVENTS, INCLUDING UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $19.1 MILLION  IN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO THE FORMER STOCKHOLDERS OF OPKO DIAGNOSTICS UPON AND SUBJECT TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES; AND UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $125.0 MILLION  IN EITHER SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK OR CASH, AT OUR OPTION SUBJECT TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES, TO THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF OPKO RENAL.  IN NOVEMBER 2015, BIOREFERENCE AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. (\u201cCB\u201d), AS LENDER AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AS AMENDED (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d).  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR A $100.0 MILLION SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND INCLUDES A $20.0 MILLION SUB-FACILITY FOR SWINGLINE LOANS AND A $20.0 MILLION SUB-FACILITY FOR THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.  BIOREFERENCE MAY INCREASE THE CREDIT FACILITY TO UP TO $275.0 MILLION ON A SECURED BASIS, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF SPECIFIED CONDITIONS.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT MATURES ON NOVEMBER 5, 2020 AND IS  53  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GUARANTEED BY ALL OF BIOREFERENCE\u2019S DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS ALSO SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ASSETS OF BIOREFERENCE AND ITS DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES, AS WELL AS A NON-RECOURSE PLEDGE BY US OF OUR EQUITY INTEREST IN BIOREFERENCE.  AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS BASED ON A BORROWING BASE COMPRISED OF ELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES OF BIOREFERENCE AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AS SPECIFIED THEREIN.  WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, INCLUDING EXPENSES RELATED TO THE HIRING OF PERSONNEL AND ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS.  WE EXPECT THAT SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WILL ALSO INCREASE AS WE EXPAND OUR SALES, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF AND ADD INFRASTRUCTURE.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON HAND AT  JUNE 30, 2019  ,  THE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE TO BE BORROWED UNDER OUR LINES OF CREDIT AND THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2025 NOTES IN FEBRUARY 2019 ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR OPERATIONS AND DEBT SERVICE BEYOND THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  WE BASED THIS ESTIMATE ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY PROVE TO BE WRONG OR ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO USE OUR AVAILABLE CASH RESOURCES SOONER THAN WE CURRENTLY EXPECT.  IF WE ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL ASSETS OR COMPANIES, ACCELERATE OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OR INITIATE ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS, WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDS.  OUR FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH PFIZER, THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF  RAYALDEE  , BIOREFERENCE\u2019S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS, THE CONTINUED PROGRESS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES, THE TIMING AND OUTCOME OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND REGULATORY APPROVALS, THE COSTS INVOLVED IN PREPARING, FILING, PROSECUTING, MAINTAINING, DEFENDING, AND ENFORCING PATENT CLAIMS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, THE STATUS OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING, OUR SUCCESS IN DEVELOPING MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES AND RESULTS OF GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, PAYOR CLAIMS, AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT MAY ARISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION CLASS ACTION AND DERIVATIVE LITIGATION TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, AND OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SUCH CLAIMS.  IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDING WHEN NEEDED, WE MAY HAVE TO DELAY, REDUCE THE SCOPE OF, OR ELIMINATE ONE OR MORE OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS OR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OR POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS OR REDUCE OUR MARKETING OR SALES EFFORTS OR CEASE OPERATIONS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\"FASB\") ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\"ASU\") NO. 2016-02, \u201cLEASES (TOPIC 842),\u201d WHICH REQUIRES ORGANIZATIONS THAT LEASE ASSETS WITH LEASE TERMS OF MORE THAN 12 MONTHS TO RECOGNIZE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS CREATED BY THOSE LEASES ON THEIR BALANCE SHEETS.  ASU 2016-02, AS AMENDED AND CODIFIED UNDER TOPIC 842, REQUIRES NEW QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES TO HELP INVESTORS AND OTHER FINANCIAL STATEMENT USERS BETTER UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNT, TIMING, AND UNCERTAINTY OF CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM LEASES.  AS REQUIRED, WE ADOPTED TOPIC 842 ON JANUARY 1, 2019 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH FOR ALL LEASE ARRANGEMENTS AT THE BEGINNING OR THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION. RESULTS FOR REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2019 ARE PRESENTED UNDER TOPIC 842, WHILE PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS WERE NOT ADJUSTED AND CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE OUR HISTORIC ACCOUNTING UNDER ASC 840.  FOR LEASES THAT COMMENCED BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF TOPIC 842, WE ELECTED THE PERMITTED PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS TO NOT REASSESS THE FOLLOWING: (I) WHETHER ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING CONTRACTS CONTAIN LEASES (II) THE LEASE CLASSIFICATION FOR ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING LEASES AND (III) INITIAL DIRECT COSTS FOR ANY EXISTING LEASES. WE ALSO ELECTED THE POLICY OF NOT RECORDING LEASES ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WHEN THE LEASES HAVE A TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS AND WE ELECTED NOT TO SEPARATE NONLEASE COMPONENTS FROM LEASE COMPONENTS AND INSTEAD ACCOUNT FOR EACH SEPARATE LEASE COMPONENT AND THE NONLEASE COMPONENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT LEASE COMPONENT AS A SINGLE LEASE COMPONENT.  THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842 RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY  $33.7 MILLION  AND OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-TO-USE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY  $33.3 MILLION  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OPERATING LEASES FOR OUR DIAGNOSTIC FACILITIES, BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. THERE WAS NO CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO BEGINNING ACCUMULATED DEFICIT ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE ACCOUNTING FOR OUR FINANCE LEASES REMAINS SUBSTANTIALLY UNCHANGED, AS FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES AND THEIR CORRESPONDING RIGHT-TO-USE ASSETS WERE ALREADY RECORDED ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET UNDER THE PREVIOUS GUIDANCE. THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842 DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. REFER TO NOTE 15 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY TOPIC 842.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-02, \"INCOME STATEMENT-REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220).\" THIS STANDARD PROVIDES AN OPTION TO RECLASSIFY STRANDED TAX EFFECTS WITHIN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS TO RETAINED EARNINGS DUE TO THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE CHANGE IN THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017. THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. WE ADOPTED THIS STANDARD EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019 WITH THE ELECTION NOT TO RECLASSIFY IMMATERIAL AMOUNTS OF STRANDED TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS TO RETAINED EARNINGS.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-07, \u201cCOMPENSATION - STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718),\u201d WHICH EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF TOPIC 718 TO INCLUDE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS FOR ACQUIRING GOODS AND SERVICES FROM NON-EMPLOYEES.  THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2018-07 ON JANUARY 1, 2019, DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  PENDING ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-13, \u201cFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326): MEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,\u201d WHICH AMENDS THE IMPAIRMENT MODEL BY REQUIRING ENTITIES TO USE A FORWARD-LOOKING APPROACH BASED ON EXPECTED LOSSES RATHER THAN INCURRED LOSSES TO ESTIMATE CREDIT LOSSES ON CERTAIN TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING TRADE RECEIVABLES. THIS MAY RESULT IN THE EARLIER RECOGNITION OF ALLOWANCES FOR LOSSES. THE ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR PUBLIC ENTITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED.

USL\u2019S  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS  FACTORS.  USL HAS BASED THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO IT ON THE DATE OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q,  AND USL ASSUMES NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH USL UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION TO REVISE OR  UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE, INVESTORS ARE ADVISED  TO CONSULT ANY ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES THAT USL MAY MAKE DIRECTLY TO THEM OR THROUGH REPORTS THAT USL FILES IN THE FUTURE WITH THE  U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \u201cSEC\u201d), INCLUDING ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM  10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K.  INTRODUCTION  USL, A DELAWARE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, IS  A COMMODITY POOL THAT ISSUES SHARES THAT MAY BE PURCHASED AND SOLD ON THE NYSE ARCA, INC. (THE \u201cNYSE ARCA\u201d). THE INVESTMENT  OBJECTIVE OF USL IS FOR THE DAILY CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS OF ITS SHARES\u2019 PER SHARE NET ASSET VALUE (\u201cNAV\u201d)  TO REFLECT THE DAILY CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS OF THE SPOT PRICE OF LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL DELIVERED TO CUSHING, OKLAHOMA, AS  MEASURED BY THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE OF THE PRICES OF 12 FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL TRADED ON THE NEW  YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE (THE \u201cNYMEX\u201d) THAT IS THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT TO EXPIRE AND THE CONTRACTS FOR THE FOLLOWING  11 MONTHS FOR A TOTAL OF 12 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS\u2019 CONTRACTS, EXCEPT WHEN THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT IS WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF EXPIRATION,  IN WHICH CASE IT WILL BE MEASURED BY THE FUTURES CONTRACT THAT IS THE NEXT MONTH CONTRACT TO EXPIRE AND THE CONTRACTS FOR THE FOLLOWING  11 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS (THE \u201cBENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS\u201d), PLUS INTEREST EARNED ON USL\u2019S COLLATERAL HOLDINGS,  LESS USL\u2019S EXPENSES. \u201cNEAR MONTH CONTRACT\u201d MEANS THE NEXT CONTRACT TRADED ON THE NYMEX DUE TO EXPIRE. \u201cNEXT  MONTH CONTRACT\u201d MEANS THE FIRST CONTRACT TRADED ON THE NYMEX DUE TO EXPIRE AFTER THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT. WHEN CALCULATING  THE DAILY MOVEMENT OF THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE 12 CONTRACTS, EACH CONTRACT MONTH WILL BE EQUALLY WEIGHTED.  USL\u2019S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE IS  NOT  FOR ITS NAV OR MARKET PRICE OF SHARES TO EQUAL, IN DOLLAR TERMS, THE SPOT PRICE OF LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL OR ANY PARTICULAR  FUTURES CONTRACT BASED ON LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL,  NOR  IS USL\u2019S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE FOR THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN ITS  NAV TO REFLECT THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE OF THE PRICE OF ANY PARTICULAR FUTURES CONTRACT AS MEASURED OVER A TIME PERIOD  GREATER  THAN ONE DAY  . THE GENERAL PARTNER OF USL, UNITED STATES COMMODITY FUNDS LLC (\u201cUSCF\u201d), BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT PRACTICAL  TO MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO TO ACHIEVE SUCH AN INVESTMENT GOAL WHEN INVESTING IN OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS (AS DEFINED BELOW) AND OTHER  OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS (AS DEFINED BELOW).  16  USL INVESTS PRIMARILY IN FUTURES CONTRACTS  FOR LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL, OTHER TYPES OF CRUDE OIL, HEATING OIL, GASOLINE, NATURAL GAS AND OTHER PETROLEUM-BASED FUELS THAT ARE  TRADED ON THE NYMEX, ICE FUTURES OR OTHER U.S. AND FOREIGN EXCHANGES (COLLECTIVELY, \u201cOIL FUTURES CONTRACTS\u201d) AND TO  A LESSER EXTENT, IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR IN VIEW OF MARKET CONDITIONS, OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS  SUCH AS CASH-SETTLED OPTIONS ON OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS, FORWARD CONTRACTS FOR OIL, CLEARED SWAP CONTRACTS AND OVER-THE-COUNTER (\u201cOTC\u201d)  SWAPS THAT ARE BASED ON THE PRICE OF OIL, OTHER PETROLEUM-BASED FUELS, OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AND INDICES BASED ON THE FOREGOING  (COLLECTIVELY, \u201cOTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS\u201d). FOR CONVENIENCE AND UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED, OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS  AND OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS COLLECTIVELY ARE REFERRED TO AS \u201cOIL INTERESTS\u201d IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM  10-Q.  USCF BELIEVES THAT MARKET ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES  WILL CAUSE DAILY CHANGES IN USL\u2019S SHARE PRICE ON THE NYSE ARCA ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS TO CLOSELY TRACK DAILY CHANGES IN USL\u2019S  PER SHARE NAV ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS. USCF FURTHER BELIEVES THAT DAILY CHANGES IN PRICES OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS  HAVE HISTORICALLY CLOSELY TRACKED THE DAILY CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES OF LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL. USCF BELIEVES THAT THE NET EFFECT  OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS WILL BE THAT THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF USL\u2019S SHARES ON THE NYSE ARCA ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS  WILL CLOSELY TRACK, THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE SPOT PRICE OF A BARREL OF LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS, PLUS INTEREST  EARNED ON USL\u2019S COLLATERAL HOLDINGS, LESS USL\u2019S EXPENSES.  USL SEEKS TO ACHIEVE ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE  BY INVESTING SO THAT THE AVERAGE DAILY PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN USL\u2019S NAV FOR ANY PERIOD OF 30 SUCCESSIVE VALUATION DAYS WILL  BE WITHIN PLUS/MINUS TEN PERCENT (10%) OF THE AVERAGE DAILY PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACT  OVER THE SAME PERIOD.  REGULATORY DISCLOSURE  ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS, POSITION LIMITS  AND PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS  . DESIGNATED CONTRACT MARKETS (\u201cDCMS\u201d), SUCH AS THE NYMEX AND ICE FUTURES, HAVE ESTABLISHED  ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS AND POSITION LIMITS ON THE MAXIMUM NET LONG OR NET SHORT FUTURES CONTRACTS IN COMMODITY INTERESTS THAT ANY  PERSON OR GROUP OF PERSONS UNDER COMMON TRADING CONTROL (OTHER THAN AS A HEDGE, WHICH AN INVESTMENT BY USL IS NOT) MAY HOLD, OWN  OR CONTROL. THESE LEVELS AND POSITION LIMITS APPLY TO THE FUTURES CONTRACTS THAT USL INVESTS IN TO MEET ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE.  IN ADDITION TO ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS AND POSITION LIMITS, THE NYMEX AND ICE FUTURES ALSO SET DAILY PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS ON  FUTURES CONTRACTS. THE DAILY PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMIT ESTABLISHES THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT THE PRICE OF A FUTURES CONTRACT MAY VARY  EITHER UP OR DOWN FROM THE PREVIOUS DAY\u2019S SETTLEMENT PRICE. ONCE THE DAILY PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMIT HAS BEEN REACHED IN A  PARTICULAR FUTURES CONTRACT, NO TRADES MAY BE MADE AT A PRICE BEYOND THAT LIMIT.  THE ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS FOR THE BENCHMARK  OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OTHER OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ON U.S.-BASED FUTURES EXCHANGES, SUCH AS THE NYMEX, ARE NOT A FIXED  CEILING, BUT RATHER A THRESHOLD ABOVE WHICH THE NYMEX MAY EXERCISE GREATER SCRUTINY AND CONTROL OVER AN INVESTOR\u2019S POSITIONS.  THE CURRENT ACCOUNTABILITY LEVEL FOR INVESTMENTS FOR ANY ONE MONTH IN THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS IS 10,000 CONTRACTS.  IN ADDITION, THE NYMEX IMPOSES AN ACCOUNTABILITY LEVEL FOR ALL MONTHS OF 20,000 NET FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL.  IN ADDITION, ICE FUTURES MAINTAINS ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS, POSITION LIMITS AND MONITORING AUTHORITY FOR ITS FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR  LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL. IF USL AND THE RELATED PUBLIC FUNDS EXCEED THESE ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS FOR INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURES CONTRACTS  FOR LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL, THE NYMEX AND ICE FUTURES WILL MONITOR SUCH EXPOSURE AND MAY ASK FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THEIR ACTIVITIES  INCLUDING THE TOTAL SIZE OF ALL POSITIONS, INVESTMENT AND TRADING STRATEGY, AND THE EXTENT OF LIQUIDITY RESOURCES OF USL AND THE  RELATED PUBLIC FUNDS. IF DEEMED NECESSARY BY THE NYMEX AND/OR ICE FUTURES, USL COULD BE ORDERED TO REDUCE ITS NET FUTURES CONTRACTS  BACK TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY LEVEL. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, USL HELD 949 FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL TRADED ON THE  NYMEX AND DID NOT HOLD ANY OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE ICE FUTURES. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 USL DID NOT  EXCEED THE ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS IMPOSED BY THE NYMEX OR ICE FUTURES, HOWEVER, THE AGGREGATED TOTAL OF CERTAIN OF THE RELATED PUBLIC  FUNDS DID EXCEED THE ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS. NO ACTION WAS TAKEN BY NYMEX AND USL DID NOT REDUCE THE NUMBER OF OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS  HELD AS A RESULT.  17  POSITION LIMITS DIFFER FROM ACCOUNTABILITY  LEVELS IN THAT THEY REPRESENT FIXED LIMITS ON THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF FUTURES CONTRACTS THAT ANY PERSON MAY HOLD AND CANNOT ALLOW  SUCH LIMITS TO BE EXCEEDED WITHOUT EXPRESS CFTC AUTHORITY TO DO SO. IN ADDITION TO ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS AND POSITION LIMITS THAT  MAY APPLY AT ANY TIME, THE NYMEX AND ICE FUTURES IMPOSE POSITION LIMITS ON CONTRACTS HELD IN THE LAST FEW DAYS OF TRADING IN THE  NEAR MONTH CONTRACT TO EXPIRE. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT USL WILL RUN UP AGAINST SUCH POSITION LIMITS BECAUSE USL\u2019S INVESTMENT  STRATEGY IS TO CLOSE OUT ITS POSITIONS AND \u201cROLL\u201d FROM THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT TO EXPIRE AND THE ELEVEN FOLLOWING MONTHS  TO THE NEXT MONTH CONTRACT TO EXPIRE AND THE ELEVEN FOLLOWING MONTHS DURING A ONE DAY EACH MONTH. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE  30, 2019, USL DID NOT EXCEED POSITION LIMITS IMPOSED BY THE NYMEX AND ICE FUTURES.  THE REGULATION OF COMMODITY INTEREST TRADING  IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES IS AN EVOLVING AREA OF THE LAW. THE VARIOUS STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS SUMMARY ARE SUBJECT  TO MODIFICATION BY LEGISLATIVE ACTION AND CHANGES IN THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SEC, FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY  (\u201cFINRA\u201d), CFTC, NFA, THE FUTURES EXCHANGES, CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER REGULATORY BODIES.  FUTURES CONTRACTS AND POSITION LIMITS  THE CFTC IS GENERALLY PROHIBITED BY STATUTE  FROM REGULATING TRADING ON NON-U.S. FUTURES EXCHANGES AND MARKETS. THE CFTC, HOWEVER, HAS ADOPTED REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE MARKETING  OF NON-U.S. FUTURES CONTRACTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE REGULATIONS PERMIT CERTAIN CONTRACTS ON NON-U.S. EXCHANGES TO BE OFFERED  AND SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE CFTC HAS PROPOSED TO ADOPT LIMITS ON  SPECULATIVE POSITIONS IN 25 PHYSICAL COMMODITY FUTURES AND OPTION CONTRACTS AS WELL AS SWAPS THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY EQUIVALENT TO  SUCH CONTRACTS IN THE AGRICULTURE, ENERGY AND METALS MARKETS (THE \u201cPOSITION LIMIT RULES\u201d). THE POSITION LIMIT RULES  WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS: IDENTIFY WHICH CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO SPECULATIVE POSITION LIMITS; SET THRESHOLDS THAT RESTRICT THE  SIZE OF SPECULATIVE POSITIONS THAT A PERSON MAY HOLD IN THE SPOT MONTH, OTHER INDIVIDUAL MONTHS, AND ALL MONTHS COMBINED; CREATE  AN EXEMPTION FOR POSITIONS THAT CONSTITUTE BONA FIDE HEDGING TRANSACTIONS; IMPOSE RESPONSIBILITIES ON DCMS AND SWAP EXECUTION FACILITIES  (\u201cSEFS\u201d) TO ESTABLISH POSITION LIMITS OR, IN SOME CASES, POSITION ACCOUNTABILITY RULES; AND APPLY TO BOTH FUTURES AND  SWAPS ACROSS FOUR RELEVANT VENUES: OTC, DCMS, SEFS AS WELL AS CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATED PLATFORMS. THE CFTC\u2019S FIRST ATTEMPT  AT FINALIZING THE POSITION LIMIT RULES, IN 2011, WAS SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS IN 2012 AND, SINCE THEN, THE  CFTC HAS RE-PROPOSED THEM AND SOLICITED COMMENTS FROM MARKET PARTICIPANTS MULTIPLE TIMES. AT THIS TIME, IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THE POSITION  LIMIT RULES MAY AFFECT USL, BUT THE EFFECT MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL AND ADVERSE. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, THE POSITION LIMIT RULES MAY NEGATIVELY  IMPACT THE ABILITY OF USL TO MEET ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES THROUGH LIMITS THAT MAY INHIBIT USCF\u2019S ABILITY TO SELL ADDITIONAL  CREATION BASKETS OF USL.  UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE POSITION LIMIT RULES  ARE ADOPTED, THE REGULATORY ARCHITECTURE IN EFFECT PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THE POSITION LIMIT RULES WILL GOVERN TRANSACTIONS IN  COMMODITIES AND RELATED DERIVATIVES. UNDER THAT SYSTEM, THE CFTC ENFORCES FEDERAL LIMITS ON SPECULATION IN NINE AGRICULTURAL  PRODUCTS (E.G., CORN, WHEAT AND SOY), WHILE FUTURES EXCHANGES ESTABLISH AND ENFORCE POSITION LIMITS AND ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS FOR  OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND CERTAIN ENERGY PRODUCTS (E.G., OIL AND NATURAL GAS). AS A RESULT, USL MAY BE LIMITED  WITH RESPECT TO THE SIZE OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN ANY COMMODITIES SUBJECT TO THESE LIMITS.  UNDER EXISTING AND RECENTLY ADOPTED CFTC  REGULATIONS, FOR THE PURPOSE OF POSITION LIMITS, A MARKET PARTICIPANT IS GENERALLY REQUIRED, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN NARROW EXCEPTIONS,  TO AGGREGATE ALL POSITIONS FOR WHICH THAT PARTICIPANT CONTROLS THE TRADING DECISIONS WITH ALL POSITIONS FOR WHICH THAT PARTICIPANT  HAS A 10 PERCENT OR GREATER OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN AN ACCOUNT OR POSITION, AS WELL AS THE POSITIONS OF TWO OR MORE PERSONS ACTING  PURSUANT TO AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED AGREEMENT OR UNDERSTANDING WITH THAT PARTICIPANT (THE \u201cAGGREGATION RULES\u201d). THE AGGREGATION  RULES WILL ALSO APPLY WITH RESPECT TO THE POSITION LIMIT RULES IF AND WHEN SUCH POSITION LIMIT RULES ARE ADOPTED.  18  OTC SWAPS  IN OCTOBER 2015, THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER  OF THE CURRENCY, THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, THE FDIC, THE FARM CREDIT ADMINISTRATION, AND THE FEDERAL  HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY (EACH AN \u201cAGENCY\u201d AND, COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cAGENCIES\u201d) JOINTLY ADOPTED FINAL RULES  TO ESTABLISH MINIMUM MARGIN AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR REGISTERED SWAP DEALERS, MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS, SECURITY-BASED SWAP  DEALERS, AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS (\u201cSWAP ENTITIES\u201d) THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF ONE OF  THE AGENCIES (SUCH ENTITIES, \u201cCOVERED SWAP ENTITIES\u201d, AND THE JOINT FINAL RULES, THE \u201cFINAL MARGIN RULES\u201d).  THE FINAL MARGIN RULES WILL SUBJECT NON-CLEARED  SWAPS AND NON-CLEARED SECURITY-BASED SWAPS BETWEEN COVERED SWAP ENTITIES AND SWAP ENTITIES, AND BETWEEN COVERED SWAP ENTITIES AND  FINANCIAL END USERS THAT HAVE MATERIAL SWAPS EXPOSURE (I.E., AN AVERAGE DAILY AGGREGATE NOTIONAL OF $8 BILLION OR MORE IN NON-CLEARED  SWAPS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINAL MARGIN RULES), TO A MANDATORY TWO-WAY MINIMUM INITIAL MARGIN REQUIREMENT. THE MINIMUM  AMOUNT OF THE INITIAL MARGIN REQUIRED TO BE POSTED OR COLLECTED WOULD BE EITHER THE AMOUNT CALCULATED BY THE COVERED SWAP ENTITY  USING A STANDARDIZED SCHEDULE SET FORTH AS AN APPENDIX TO THE FINAL MARGIN RULES, WHICH PROVIDES THE GROSS INITIAL MARGIN (AS A  PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NOTIONAL EXPOSURE) FOR CERTAIN ASSET CLASSES, OR AN INTERNAL MARGIN MODEL OF THE COVERED SWAP ENTITY CONFORMING  TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL MARGIN RULES THAT IS APPROVED BY THE AGENCY HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTICULAR COVERED SWAP  ENTITY. THE FINAL MARGIN RULES SPECIFY THE TYPES OF COLLATERAL THAT MAY BE POSTED OR COLLECTED AS INITIAL MARGIN FOR NON-CLEARED  SWAPS AND NON-CLEARED SECURITY-BASED SWAPS WITH FINANCIAL END USERS (GENERALLY CASH, CERTAIN GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE  SECURITIES, CERTAIN LIQUID DEBT, CERTAIN EQUITY SECURITIES, CERTAIN ELIGIBLE PUBLICLY TRADED DEBT, AND GOLD); AND SETS FORTH HAIRCUTS  FOR CERTAIN COLLATERAL ASSET CLASSES.  THE FINAL MARGIN RULES REQUIRE MINIMUM  VARIATION MARGIN TO BE EXCHANGED DAILY FOR NON-CLEARED SWAPS AND NON-CLEARED SECURITY-BASED SWAPS BETWEEN COVERED SWAP ENTITIES  AND SWAP ENTITIES AND BETWEEN COVERED SWAP ENTITIES AND ALL FINANCIAL END-USERS (WITHOUT REGARD TO THE SWAPS EXPOSURE OF THE PARTICULAR  FINANCIAL END-USER). THE MINIMUM VARIATION MARGIN AMOUNT IS THE DAILY MARK-TO-MARKET CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE SWAP TO THE COVERED  SWAP ENTITY, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT VARIATION MARGIN PREVIOUSLY POSTED OR COLLECTED. FOR NON-CLEARED SWAPS AND SECURITY-BASED SWAPS  BETWEEN COVERED SWAP ENTITIES AND FINANCIAL END-USERS, VARIATION MARGIN MAY BE POSTED OR COLLECTED IN CASH OR NON-CASH COLLATERAL  THAT IS CONSIDERED ELIGIBLE FOR INITIAL MARGIN PURPOSES. VARIATION MARGIN IS NOT SUBJECT TO SEGREGATION WITH AN INDEPENDENT, THIRD-PARTY  CUSTODIAN, AND MAY, IF PERMITTED BY CONTRACT, BE REHYPOTHECATED.  THE INITIAL MARGIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE  FINAL MARGIN RULES ARE BEING PHASED IN OVER TIME, AND THE VARIATION MARGIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL MARGIN RULES ARE CURRENTLY  IN EFFECT. THE FUND IS NOT A COVERED SWAP ENTITY UNDER THE FINAL MARGIN RULES, BUT IT IS A FINANCIAL END-USER. ACCORDINGLY, THE  FUND IS CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO THE VARIATION MARGIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL MARGIN RULES. HOWEVER, THE FUND DOES NOT HAVE  MATERIAL SWAPS EXPOSURE AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE FUND WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE INITIAL MARGIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL MARGIN RULES.  THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER  PROTECTION ACT (THE \u201cDODD-FRANK ACT\u201d) REQUIRED THE CFTC AND THE SEC TO ADOPT THEIR OWN MARGIN RULES TO APPLY TO  A LIMITED NUMBER OF REGISTERED SWAP DEALERS, SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS, MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS, AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP  PARTICIPANTS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF ONE OF THE AGENCIES. ON DECEMBER 16, 2015 THE CFTC FINALIZED ITS MARGIN  RULES, WHICH ARE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THE FINAL MARGIN RULES AND HAVE THE SAME IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE. THE SEC ADOPTED MARGIN  RULES FOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS ON JUNE 21, 2019. THE SEC\u2019S MARGIN RULES  ARE GENERALLY ALIGNED WITH THE FINAL MARGIN RULES AND THE CFTC\u2019S MARGIN RULES, BUT THEY DIFFER IN A FEW KEY RESPECTS RELATING  TO TIMING FOR COMPLIANCE AND THE MANNER IN WHICH INITIAL MARGIN MUST BE SEGREGATED. USL DOES NOT CURRENTLY ENGAGE IN SECURITY-BASED  SWAP TRANSACTIONS AND, THEREFORE, THE SEC\u2019S MARGIN RULES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO APPLY TO USL.  MANDATORY TRADING AND CLEARING OF SWAPS  CFTC REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT CERTAIN SWAP  TRANSACTIONS BE EXECUTED ON ORGANIZED EXCHANGES OR \u201cSWAP EXECUTION FACILITIES\u201d AND CLEARED THROUGH REGULATED CLEARING  ORGANIZATIONS (\u201cDERIVATIVE CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS\u201d (\u201cDCOS\u201d)), IF THE CFTC MANDATES THE CENTRAL CLEARING  OF A PARTICULAR CLASS OF SWAP AND SUCH SWAP IS \u201cMADE AVAILABLE TO TRADE\u201d ON A SWAP EXECUTION FACILITY. CURRENTLY, SWAP  DEALERS, MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS, COMMODITY POOLS, CERTAIN PRIVATE FUNDS AND ENTITIES PREDOMINANTLY ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES THAT  ARE FINANCIAL IN NATURE ARE REQUIRED TO EXECUTE ON A SWAP EXECUTION FACILITY, AND CLEAR, CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND INDEX-BASED  CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS. AS A RESULT, IF USL ENTERS INTO AN INTEREST RATE OR INDEX-BASED CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP THAT IS SUBJECT  TO THESE REQUIREMENTS, SUCH SWAP WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE EXECUTED ON A SWAP EXECUTION FACILITY AND CENTRALLY CLEARED. MANDATORY  CLEARING AND \u201cMADE AVAILABLE TO TRADE\u201d DETERMINATIONS WITH RESPECT TO ADDITIONAL TYPES OF SWAPS ARE EXPECTED IN THE  FUTURE, AND, WHEN FINALIZED, COULD REQUIRE USL TO ELECTRONICALLY EXECUTE AND CENTRALLY CLEAR CERTAIN OTC INSTRUMENTS PRESENTLY  ENTERED INTO AND SETTLED ON A BI-LATERAL BASIS. IF A SWAP IS REQUIRED TO BE CLEARED, INITIAL AND VARIATION MARGIN REQUIREMENTS  ARE SET BY THE RELEVANT CLEARING ORGANIZATION, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES. ADDITIONAL MARGIN MAY  BE REQUIRED AND HELD BY USL'S FCM.  OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR SWAPS  IN ADDITION TO THE MARGIN REQUIREMENTS  DESCRIBED ABOVE, SWAPS THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE CLEARED AND EXECUTED ON A SEF BUT THAT ARE EXECUTED BILATERALLY ARE ALSO SUBJECT  TO VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS PURSUANT TO CFTC REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REPORTING AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS AND,  DEPENDING ON THE STATUS OF THE COUNTERPARTIES, TRADING DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION REQUIREMENTS.  19  DERIVATIVES REGULATIONS IN NON-U.S.  JURISDICTIONS  IN ADDITION TO U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS, USL  MAY BE SUBJECT TO NON-U.S. DERIVATIVES LAWS AND REGULATIONS IF IT ENGAGES IN FUTURES AND/OR SWAP TRANSACTIONS WITH NON-U.S. PERSONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, USL MAY BE IMPACTED BY EUROPEAN LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO THE EXTENT THAT IT ENGAGES IN FUTURES TRANSACTIONS ON  EUROPEAN EXCHANGES OR DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS WITH EUROPEAN ENTITIES. OTHER JURISDICTIONS IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO FUTURES  AND DERIVATIVES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IMPOSED BY THE U.S., INCLUDING POSITION LIMITS, MARGIN, CLEARING AND TRADE EXECUTION  REQUIREMENTS.  MONEY MARKET FUNDS  THE SEC ADOPTED AMENDMENTS TO RULE 2A-7  UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, AS AMENDED (\"1940 ACT\") WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN 2016, TO REFORM MONEY  MARKET FUNDS (\u201cMMFS\u201d). WHILE THE RULE APPLIES ONLY TO MMFS, IT MAY INDIRECTLY AFFECT INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS SUCH AS  USL. A PORTION OF USL'S ASSETS THAT ARE NOT USED FOR MARGIN OR COLLATERAL IN THE FUTURES CONTRACTS CURRENTLY ARE INVESTED  IN GOVERNMENT MMFS. USL DOES NOT HOLD ANY NON-GOVERNMENT MMFS AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE INVESTING IN ANY NON-GOVERNMENT MMFS.  HOWEVER, IF USL INVESTS IN OTHER TYPES OF MMFS BESIDES GOVERNMENT MMFS IN THE FUTURE, USL COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INVESTING  IN AN MMF THAT DOES NOT MAINTAIN A STABLE $1.00 NAV OR THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPOSE REDEMPTION FEES AND GATES (TEMPORARY  SUSPENSION OF REDEMPTIONS).  ALTHOUGH SUCH GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUNDS  SEEK TO PRESERVE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT AT $1.00 PER SHARE, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO AND USL  MAY LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND. AN INVESTMENT IN A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND IS NOT INSURED OR  GUARANTEED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE FDIC, OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY. THE SHARE  PRICE OF A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND CAN FALL BELOW THE $1.00 SHARE PRICE. USL CANNOT RELY ON OR EXPECT A GOVERNMENT MONEY  MARKET FUND\u2019S ADVISER OR ITS AFFILIATES TO ENTER INTO SUPPORT AGREEMENTS OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS TO MAINTAIN THE GOVERNMENT  MONEY MARKET FUND\u2019S $1.00 SHARE PRICE. THE CREDIT QUALITY OF A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND\u2019S HOLDINGS CAN CHANGE RAPIDLY  IN CERTAIN MARKETS, AND THE DEFAULT OF A SINGLE HOLDING COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND\u2019S  SHARE PRICE. DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, THE MARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES HELD BY A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND MAY VARY.  A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND\u2019S SHARE PRICE CAN ALSO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED DURING PERIODS OF HIGH REDEMPTION PRESSURES  AND/OR ILLIQUID MARKETS.  PRICE MOVEMENTS  CRUDE OIL FUTURES PRICES WERE VOLATILE  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS STARTED THE  PERIOD AT $47.21 PER BARREL. THE HIGH OF THE PERIOD WAS ON APRIL 23, 2019 WHEN THE AVERAGE PRICE REACHED $64.69 PER BARREL.  THE AVERAGE LOW OF THE PERIOD WAS THE STARTING PRICE FOR THE PERIOD, WHICH WAS $47.21 PER BARREL. THE PERIOD ENDED WITH THE  AVERAGE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AT $57.45 PER BARREL, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 21.69% OVER THE  PERIOD. USL\u2019S PER SHARE NAV BEGAN THE PERIOD AT $17.82 AND ENDED THE PERIOD AT $21.80 ON JUNE 30, 2019, AN  INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 22.33% OVER THE PERIOD. USL\u2019S PER SHARE NAV REACHED ITS HIGH FOR THE PERIOD ON APRIL  23, 2019 AT $24.36 AND ITS LOW FOR THE PERIOD WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD WHEN IT WAS $17.82. THE AVERAGE  BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS PRICES LISTED ABOVE BEGAN WITH THE FEBRUARY 2019 TO JANUARY 2020 CONTRACTS AND ENDED WITH  THE AUGUST 2019 TO JULY 2020 CONTRACTS. THE INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 21.69% ON THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK  OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS LISTED ABOVE IS A HYPOTHETICAL RETURN ONLY AND COULD NOT ACTUALLY BE ACHIEVED BY AN INVESTOR HOLDING OIL  FUTURES CONTRACTS. AN INVESTMENT IN OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS WOULD NEED TO BE ROLLED FORWARD DURING THE TIME PERIOD DESCRIBED  IN ORDER TO SIMULATE SUCH A RESULT. FURTHERMORE, THE CHANGE IN THE NOMINAL PRICE OF THESE DIFFERING OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS, MEASURED  FROM THE START OF THE PERIOD TO THE END OF THE PERIOD, DOES NOT REPRESENT THE ACTUAL BENCHMARK RESULTS THAT USL SEEKS TO TRACK,  WHICH ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED BELOW IN THE SECTION TITLED \u201c  TRACKING USL'S BENCHMARK  .\u201d  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019,  THE CRUDE OIL FUTURES MARKET WAS IN A STATE OF CONTANGO, MEANING THAT THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT WAS  LOWER THAN THE PRICE OF THE NEXT MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT, OR CONTRACTS FURTHER AWAY FROM EXPIRATION. ON DAYS WHEN THE  MARKET IS IN BACKWARDATION, THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT IS TYPICALLY HIGHER THAN THE PRICE OF THE NEXT  MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT OR CONTRACTS FURTHER AWAY FROM EXPIRATION. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF BACKWARDATION AND  CONTANGO ON TOTAL RETURNS, SEE  \u201cTERM STRUCTURE OF CRUDE OIL PRICES AND THE IMPACT ON TOTAL RETURNS\u201d  BELOW.  20  VALUATION OF OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AND  THE COMPUTATION OF THE PER SHARE NAV  THE PER SHARE NAV OF USL\u2019S SHARES  IS CALCULATED ONCE EACH NYSE ARCA TRADING DAY. THE PER SHARE NAV FOR A PARTICULAR TRADING DAY IS RELEASED AFTER 4:00 P.M. NEW YORK  TIME. TRADING DURING THE CORE TRADING SESSION ON THE NYSE ARCA TYPICALLY CLOSES AT 4:00 P.M. NEW YORK TIME. USL\u2019S ADMINISTRATOR  USES THE NYMEX CLOSING PRICE (DETERMINED AT THE EARLIER OF THE CLOSE OF THE NYMEX OR 2:30 P.M. NEW YORK TIME) FOR THE CONTRACTS  HELD ON THE NYMEX, BUT CALCULATES OR DETERMINES THE VALUE OF ALL OTHER USL INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING ICE FUTURES CONTRACTS OR OTHER  FUTURES CONTRACTS, AS OF THE EARLIER OF THE CLOSE OF THE NYSE ARCA OR 4:00 P.M. NEW YORK TIME.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE CRUDE  OIL MARKET  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  ON DECEMBER  6, 2007, USL LISTED ITS SHARES ON THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE (THE \u201cAMEX\u201d) UNDER THE TICKER SYMBOL \u201cUSL.\u201d  ON THAT DAY, USL ESTABLISHED ITS INITIAL OFFERING PRICE AT $50.00 PER SHARE AND ISSUED 300,000 SHARES TO THE INITIAL AUTHORIZED  PARTICIPANT IN EXCHANGE FOR $15,000,000 IN CASH. AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE AMEX BY NYSE EURONEXT, USL\u2019S SHARES  CEASED TRADING ON THE AMEX AND COMMENCED TRADING ON THE NYSE ARCA ON NOVEMBER 25, 2008.  SINCE ITS INITIAL OFFERING OF 11,000,000  SHARES, USL HAS REGISTERED ONE SUBSEQUENT OFFERING OF ITS SHARES: 100,000,000 SHARES WHICH WERE REGISTERED WITH THE SEC ON MARCH  31, 2009. SHARES OFFERED BY USL IN THE SUBSEQUENT OFFERINGS WERE SOLD BY IT FOR CASH AT THE SHARES\u2019 PER SHARE NAV AS DESCRIBED  IN THE APPLICABLE PROSPECTUS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, USL HAD ISSUED 23,250,000 SHARES, 2,500,000 OF WHICH WERE OUTSTANDING. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019, THERE WERE 87,750,000 SHARES REGISTERED BUT NOT YET ISSUED.  MORE SHARES MAY HAVE BEEN ISSUED BY USL  THAN ARE OUTSTANDING DUE TO THE REDEMPTION OF SHARES. UNLIKE FUNDS THAT ARE REGISTERED UNDER THE 1940 ACT, SHARES THAT HAVE BEEN  REDEEMED BY USL CANNOT BE RESOLD BY USL. AS A RESULT, USL CONTEMPLATES THAT ADDITIONAL OFFERINGS OF ITS SHARES WILL BE REGISTERED  WITH THE SEC IN THE FUTURE IN ANTICIPATION OF ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES AND REDEMPTIONS.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, USL HAD THE FOLLOWING  AUTHORIZED PARTICIPANTS: CITADEL SECURITIES LLC, CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC., GOLDMAN SACHS & COMPANY, JP MORGAN SECURITIES  INC., MERRILL LYNCH PROFESSIONAL CLEARING CORP., MORGAN STANLEY & COMPANY INC., NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL INC., RBC  CAPITAL MARKETS LLC, SG AMERICAS SECURITIES LLC, AND VIRTU FINANCIAL BD LLC.  21  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  FOR THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  FOR THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS  $59,205,666  $85,328,246  DIVIDEND AND INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON TREASURIES, CASH AND/OR CASH EQUIVALENTS  $689,066  $642,491  ANNUALIZED YIELD BASED ON AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS  2.35%  1.52%  MANAGEMENT FEE  $176,157  $253,881  TOTAL FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES EXCLUDING MANAGEMENT FEES  $90,882  $90,795  TOTAL COMMISSIONS ACCRUED TO BROKERS  $3,857  $3,219  TOTAL COMMISSIONS AS ANNUALIZED PERCENTAGE OF AVERAGE TOTAL NET ASSETS  0.01%  0.01%  COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF REBALANCING  $3,446  $2,439  PERCENTAGE OF COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF REBALANCING  89.34%  75.77%  COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF CREATION AND REDEMPTION ACTIVITY  $411  $780  PERCENTAGE OF COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF CREATION AND REDEMPTION ACTIVITY  10.66%  24.23%  PORTFOLIO EXPENSES.  USL\u2019S  EXPENSES CONSIST OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES, BROKERAGE FEES AND COMMISSIONS, CERTAIN OFFERING COSTS, LICENSING FEES, REGISTRATION  FEES, THE FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF USCF AND EXPENSES RELATING TO TAX ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  THE MANAGEMENT FEE THAT USL PAYS TO USCF IS CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL NET ASSETS OF USL. THE FEE IS ACCRUED  DAILY AND PAID MONTHLY.  AVERAGE INTEREST RATES EARNED ON SHORT-TERM  INVESTMENTS HELD BY USL, INCLUDING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND TREASURIES, WERE HIGHER DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019, COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. AS A RESULT, THE AMOUNT OF INCOME EARNED BY USL AS A PERCENTAGE  OF AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS WAS HIGHER DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  THE CHANGE IN TOTAL FEES AND OTHER  EXPENSES EXCLUDING MANAGEMENT FEES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE  30, 2018 WAS NEGLIGIBLE.  THE INCREASE IN TOTAL COMMISSIONS ACCRUED  TO BROKERS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, WAS DUE PRIMARILY  TO A HIGHER NUMBER OF OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS BEING HELD AND TRADED.  22  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS  $58,522,315  $84,621,388  DIVIDEND AND INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON TREASURIES, CASH AND/OR CASH EQUIVALENTS  $346,813  $347,526  ANNUALIZED YIELD BASED ON AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS  2.38%  1.65%  MANAGEMENT FEE  $87,543  $126,585  TOTAL FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES EXCLUDING MANAGEMENT FEES  $45,432  $45,712  TOTAL COMMISSIONS ACCRUED TO BROKERS  $1,985  $2,645  TOTAL COMMISSIONS AS ANNUALIZED PERCENTAGE OF AVERAGE TOTAL NET ASSETS  0.01%  0.01%  COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF REBALANCING  $1,623  $2,405  PERCENTAGE OF COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF REBALANCING  81.76%  90.93%  COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF CREATION AND REDEMPTION ACTIVITY  $362  $240  PERCENTAGE OF COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF CREATION AND REDEMPTION ACTIVITY  18.24%  9.07%  PORTFOLIO EXPENSES.  USL\u2019S  EXPENSES CONSIST OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES, BROKERAGE FEES AND COMMISSIONS, CERTAIN OFFERING COSTS, LICENSING FEES, REGISTRATION  FEES, THE FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF USCF AND EXPENSES RELATING TO TAX ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  THE MANAGEMENT FEE THAT USL PAYS TO USCF IS CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL NET ASSETS OF USL. THE FEE IS ACCRUED DAILY  AND PAID MONTHLY.  AVERAGE INTEREST RATES EARNED ON SHORT-TERM  INVESTMENTS HELD BY USL, INCLUDING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND TREASURIES, WERE HIGHER DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019,  COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. AS A RESULT, THE AMOUNT OF INCOME EARNED BY USL AS A PERCENTAGE OF AVERAGE  DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS WAS HIGHER DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2018.  THE CHANGE IN TOTAL FEES AND OTHER  EXPENSES EXCLUDING MANAGEMENT FEES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  WAS NEGLIGIBLE.  THE DECREASE IN TOTAL COMMISSIONS ACCRUED  TO BROKERS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A LOWER NUMBER  OF FUTURES CONTRACTS BEING HELD AND TRADED.  23  TRACKING USL'S BENCHMARK  USCF SEEKS TO MANAGE USL'S PORTFOLIO SUCH  THAT CHANGES IN ITS AVERAGE DAILY PER SHARE NAV, ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS, CLOSELY TRACK THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE OF  THE PRICES OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS, ALSO ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS. SPECIFICALLY, USCF SEEKS TO MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO  SUCH THAT OVER ANY ROLLING PERIOD OF 30-VALUATION DAYS, THE AVERAGE DAILY CHANGE IN USL'S PER SHARE NAV IS WITHIN A RANGE  OF 90% TO 110% (0.9 TO 1.1) OF THE AVERAGE DAILY CHANGE IN THE PRICES OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. AS AN EXAMPLE,  IF THE AVERAGE DAILY MOVEMENT OF THE AVERAGE OF THE PRICES OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR A PARTICULAR 30-VALUATION  DAY TIME PERIOD WAS 0.50% PER DAY, USCF WOULD ATTEMPT TO MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO SUCH THAT THE AVERAGE DAILY MOVEMENT OF THE PER SHARE  NAV DURING THAT SAME TIME PERIOD FELL BETWEEN 0.45% AND 0.55% (I.E., BETWEEN 0.9 AND 1.1 OF THE BENCHMARK\u2019S RESULTS). USL'S  PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT GOALS DO NOT INCLUDE TRYING TO MAKE THE NOMINAL PRICE OF USL'S PER SHARE NAV EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE OF  THE NOMINAL PRICES OF THE CURRENT BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS OR THE SPOT PRICE FOR LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL. USCF BELIEVES  THAT IT IS NOT PRACTICAL TO MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO TO ACHIEVE SUCH AN INVESTMENT GOAL WHEN INVESTING IN OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS  AND OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS.  FOR THE 30-VALUATION DAYS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019, THE SIMPLE AVERAGE DAILY CHANGE IN THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS WAS (0.235)%, WHILE THE SIMPLE AVERAGE DAILY  CHANGE IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF USL OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD WAS (0.229)%. THE AVERAGE DAILY DIFFERENCE WAS 0.006% (OR 0.6  BASIS POINTS, WHERE 1 BASIS POINT EQUALS 1/100 OF 1%). AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE DAILY MOVEMENT OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS,  THE AVERAGE ERROR IN DAILY TRACKING BY THE PER SHARE NAV WAS (2.224)%, MEANING THAT OVER THIS TIME PERIOD USL\u2019S TRACKING  ERROR WAS WITHIN THE PLUS OR MINUS 10% RANGE ESTABLISHED AS ITS BENCHMARK TRACKING GOAL. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE LEVEL  OF USL'S RELATIVE TRACKING ERROR AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE BENCHMARK WAS DUE TO PERIODS OF FLAT PRICE RETURNS.  SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE OFFERING  OF USL\u2019S SHARES TO THE PUBLIC ON DECEMBER 6, 2007 TO JUNE 30, 2019, THE SIMPLE AVERAGE DAILY CHANGE IN THE BENCHMARK  OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS WAS (0.008)%, WHILE THE SIMPLE AVERAGE DAILY CHANGE IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF USL OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD  WAS (0.009)%. THE AVERAGE DAILY DIFFERENCE WAS (0.001)% (OR (0.1) BASIS POINTS, WHERE 1 BASIS POINT EQUALS 1/100 OF 1%). AS  A PERCENTAGE OF THE DAILY MOVEMENT OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS, THE AVERAGE ERROR IN DAILY TRACKING BY THE PER SHARE  NAV WAS (0.578)%, MEANING THAT OVER THIS TIME PERIOD USL\u2019S TRACKING ERROR WAS WITHIN THE PLUS OR MINUS 10% RANGE ESTABLISHED  AS ITS BENCHMARK TRACKING GOAL. THE FOLLOWING TWO GRAPHS DEMONSTRATE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE CHANGES IN USL\u2019S NAV AND  THE CHANGES IN THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. THE FIRST GRAPH EXHIBITS THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE LAST 30 VALUATION DAYS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019. THE SECOND GRAPH MEASURES MONTHLY CHANGES SINCE JUNE 30, 2014 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2019.  *PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS  24  *PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS  AN ALTERNATIVE TRACKING MEASUREMENT OF  THE RETURN PERFORMANCE OF USL VERSUS THE RETURN OF ITS BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS CAN BE CALCULATED BY COMPARING  THE ACTUAL AVERAGE OF THE PRICES OF ITS RETURN OF USL, MEASURED BY CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE NAV, VERSUS THE EXPECTED CHANGES IN  ITS PER SHARE NAV UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT USL\u2019S RETURNS HAD BEEN EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE OF  THE PRICES OF ITS BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019, THE ACTUAL TOTAL RETURN OF USL AS MEASURED BY CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE NAV WAS 22.33%. THIS IS BASED ON AN INITIAL PER  SHARE NAV OF $17.82 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND AN ENDING PER SHARE NAV AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 OF $21.80. DURING THIS TIME  PERIOD, USL MADE NO DISTRIBUTIONS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS. HOWEVER, IF USL\u2019S DAILY CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE NAV HAD INSTEAD  EXACTLY TRACKED THE CHANGES IN THE DAILY TOTAL RETURN OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS, USL WOULD HAVE HAD AN ESTIMATED  PER SHARE NAV OF $21.64 AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, FOR A TOTAL RETURN OVER THE RELEVANT TIME PERIOD OF 21.44%. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  THE ACTUAL PER SHARE NAV TOTAL RETURN OF USL OF 22.33% AND THE EXPECTED TOTAL RETURN BASED ON THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS  OF 21.44% WAS AN ERROR OVER THE TIME PERIOD OF 0.89%, WHICH IS TO SAY THAT USL\u2019S ACTUAL TOTAL RETURN OUTPERFORMED ITS BENCHMARK BY  THAT PERCENTAGE. USL INCURS EXPENSES PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF THE MANAGEMENT FEE, BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS FOR THE BUYING AND SELLING  OF FUTURES CONTRACTS, AND OTHER EXPENSES. THE IMPACT OF THESE EXPENSES, OFFSET BY INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME, AND NET OF POSITIVE  OR NEGATIVE EXECUTION, TENDS TO CAUSE DAILY CHANGES IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF USL TO TRACK SLIGHTLY LOWER OR HIGHER THAN  DAILY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS.  BY COMPARISON, FOR THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, THE ACTUAL TOTAL RETURN OF USL AS MEASURED BY CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE NAV WAS 20.52%. THIS WAS BASED  ON AN INITIAL PER SHARE NAV OF $21.05 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND AN ENDING PER SHARE NAV AS OF JUNE 30, 2018 OF $25.37.  DURING THIS TIME PERIOD, USL MADE NO DISTRIBUTIONS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS. HOWEVER, IF USL\u2019S DAILY CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE  NAV HAD INSTEAD EXACTLY TRACKED THE CHANGES IN THE DAILY TOTAL RETURN OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS, USL WOULD HAVE  HAD AN ESTIMATED PER SHARE NAV OF $25.28 AS OF JUNE 30, 2018, FOR A TOTAL RETURN OVER THE RELEVANT TIME PERIOD OF 20.10%. THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN THE ACTUAL PER SHARE NAV TOTAL RETURN OF USL OF 20.52% AND THE EXPECTED TOTAL RETURN BASED ON THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES  CONTRACTS OF 20.10% WAS AN ERROR OVER THE TIME PERIOD OF 0.42%, WHICH IS TO SAY THAT USL\u2019S ACTUAL TOTAL RETURN OUTPERFORMED  ITS BENCHMARK BY THAT PERCENTAGE. USL INCURRED EXPENSES PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF THE MANAGEMENT FEE, BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS FOR  THE BUYING AND SELLING OF FUTURES CONTRACTS, AND OTHER EXPENSES. THE IMPACT OF THESE EXPENSES, OFFSET BY INTEREST AND DIVIDEND  INCOME, AND NET OF POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EXECUTION, TENDED TO CAUSE DAILY CHANGES IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF USL TO TRACK SLIGHTLY  LOWER OR HIGHER THAN DAILY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS.  25  THERE ARE CURRENTLY THREE FACTORS  THAT HAVE IMPACTED OR ARE MOST LIKELY TO IMPACT USL'S ABILITY TO ACCURATELY TRACK ITS BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS.  FIRST, USL MAY BUY OR SELL ITS  HOLDINGS IN THE THEN CURRENT BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AT A PRICE OTHER THAN THE CLOSING SETTLEMENT PRICE OF THAT CONTRACT  ON THE DAY DURING WHICH USL EXECUTES THE TRADE. IN THAT CASE, USL MAY PAY A PRICE THAT IS HIGHER, OR LOWER, THAN THAT  OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE CHANGES IN THE DAILY PER SHARE NAV OF USL TO EITHER BE TOO HIGH  OR TOO LOW RELATIVE TO THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. DURING THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, USCF ATTEMPTED TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS BY SEEKING TO EXECUTE ITS PURCHASE OR SALE OF  THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AT, OR AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO, THE END OF THE DAY SETTLEMENT PRICE. HOWEVER, IT MAY NOT  ALWAYS BE POSSIBLE FOR USL TO OBTAIN THE CLOSING SETTLEMENT PRICE AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT FAILURE TO OBTAIN THE CLOSING  SETTLEMENT PRICE IN THE FUTURE WILL NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT USL'S ATTEMPT TO TRACK THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS.  SECOND, USL INCURS EXPENSES PRIMARILY  COMPOSED OF THE MANAGEMENT FEE, BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS FOR THE BUYING AND SELLING OF FUTURES CONTRACTS, AND OTHER EXPENSES. THE  IMPACT OF THESE EXPENSES TENDS TO CAUSE DAILY CHANGES IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF USL TO TRACK SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN DAILY CHANGES  IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. AT THE SAME TIME, USL EARNS DIVIDEND AND INTEREST INCOME ON ITS CASH,  CASH EQUIVALENTS AND TREASURIES. USL IS NOT REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE ANY PORTION OF ITS INCOME TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND DID NOT  MAKE ANY DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. INTEREST PAYMENTS, AND ANY OTHER INCOME,  WERE RETAINED WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO AND ADDED TO USL'S NAV. WHEN THIS INCOME EXCEEDS THE LEVEL OF USL'S EXPENSES FOR ITS  MANAGEMENT FEE, BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS AND OTHER EXPENSES (INCLUDING ONGOING REGISTRATION FEES, LICENSING FEES AND THE FEES AND  EXPENSES OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF USCF), USL WILL REALIZE A NET YIELD THAT WILL TEND TO CAUSE DAILY CHANGES IN THE  PER SHARE NAV OF USL TO TRACK SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN DAILY CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE OF THE PRICES OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES  CONTRACTS. IF SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES RISE ABOVE THE CURRENT LEVELS, THE LEVEL OF DEVIATION CREATED BY THE YIELD WOULD INCREASE.  CONVERSELY, IF SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES WERE TO DECLINE, THE AMOUNT OF ERROR CREATED BY THE YIELD WOULD DECREASE. WHEN SHORT-TERM  YIELDS DROP TO A LEVEL LOWER THAN THE COMBINED EXPENSES OF THE MANAGEMENT FEE AND THE BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS, THEN THE TRACKING  ERROR BECOMES A NEGATIVE NUMBER AND WOULD TEND TO CAUSE THE DAILY RETURNS OF THE PER SHARE NAV TO UNDERPERFORM THE DAILY RETURNS  OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. USCF ANTICIPATES THAT INTEREST RATES MAY STAGNATE OVER THE NEAR FUTURE FROM HISTORICAL  LOWS. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT FEES AND EXPENSES PAID BY USL MAY CONTINUE TO BE LOWER THAN INTEREST EARNED BY USL. AS SUCH,  USCF ANTICIPATES THAT USL COULD POSSIBLY OUTPERFORM ITS BENCHMARK SO LONG AS INTEREST EARNED AT LEAST EQUALS OR EXCEEDS THE  FEES AND EXPENSES PAID BY USL.  THIRD, USL MAY HOLD OTHER OIL-RELATED  INVESTMENTS IN ITS PORTFOLIO THAT MAY FAIL TO CLOSELY TRACK THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS' TOTAL RETURN MOVEMENTS. IN  THAT CASE, THE ERROR IN TRACKING THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS COULD RESULT IN DAILY CHANGES IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF USL  THAT ARE EITHER TOO HIGH, OR TOO LOW, RELATIVE TO THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, USL DID NOT HOLD ANY OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS. IF USL INCREASES  IN SIZE, AND DUE TO ITS OBLIGATIONS TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY LIMITS, USL MAY INVEST IN OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS WHICH MAY  HAVE THE EFFECT OF INCREASING TRANSACTION RELATED EXPENSES AND MAY RESULT IN INCREASED TRACKING ERROR.  TERM STRUCTURE OF CRUDE OIL FUTURES  PRICES AND THE IMPACT ON TOTAL RETURNS.  SEVERAL FACTORS DETERMINE THE TOTAL RETURN FROM INVESTING IN FUTURES CONTRACTS. ONE  FACTOR ARISES FROM \u201cROLLING\u201d FUTURES CONTRACTS THAT WILL EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE CURRENT MONTH (THE \u201cNEAR\u201d  OR \u201cFRONT\u201d MONTH CONTRACT) FORWARD EACH MONTH PRIOR TO EXPIRATION. FOR A STRATEGY THAT ENTAILS HOLDING THE NEAR MONTH  CONTRACT, THE PRICE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT FUTURES CONTRACT AND THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WILL IMPACT RETURNS. FOR EXAMPLE,  IF THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS HIGHER THAN THE NEXT FUTURES MONTH CONTRACT (A SITUATION REFERRED TO AS \u201cBACKWARDATION\u201d),  THEN ABSENT ANY OTHER CHANGE, THE PRICE OF A NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT TENDS TO RISE IN VALUE AS IT BECOMES THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES  CONTRACT AND APPROACHES EXPIRATION. CONVERSELY, IF THE PRICE OF A NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS LOWER THAN THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES  CONTRACT (A SITUATION REFERRED TO AS \u201cCONTANGO\u201d), THEN ABSENT ANY OTHER CHANGE, THE PRICE OF A NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT  TENDS TO DECLINE IN VALUE AS IT BECOMES THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT AND APPROACHES EXPIRATION.  AS AN EXAMPLE, ASSUME THAT THE PRICE OF CRUDE  OIL FOR IMMEDIATE DELIVERY, IS $50 PER BARREL, AND THE VALUE OF A POSITION IN THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS ALSO $50. OVER  TIME, THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON A NUMBER OF MARKET FACTORS, INCLUDING DEMAND FOR OIL RELATIVE TO  SUPPLY. THE VALUE OF THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WILL LIKEWISE FLUCTUATE IN REACTION TO A NUMBER OF MARKET FACTORS. IF AN INVESTOR  SEEKS TO MAINTAIN A POSITION IN A NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT AND NOT TAKE DELIVERY OF PHYSICAL BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL, THE  INVESTOR MUST SELL THE CURRENT NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT AS IT APPROACHES EXPIRATION AND INVEST IN THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT.  IN ORDER TO CONTINUE HOLDING A POSITION IN THE CURRENT NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT, THIS \u201cROLL\u201d FORWARD OF THE FUTURES  CONTRACT MUST BE EXECUTED EVERY MONTH.  CONTANGO AND BACKWARDATION ARE NATURAL  MARKET FORCES THAT HAVE IMPACTED THE TOTAL RETURN ON AN INVESTMENT IN USL\u2019S SHARES DURING THE PAST YEAR RELATIVE TO A HYPOTHETICAL  DIRECT INVESTMENT IN CRUDE OIL. IN THE FUTURE, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MARKET PRICE OF USL\u2019S SHARES  AND CHANGES IN THE SPOT PRICES OF LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY CONTANGO AND BACKWARDATION. IT IS  IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS COMPARISON IGNORES THE POTENTIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PHYSICALLY OWNING AND STORING CRUDE OIL, WHICH  COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL.  26  IF THE FUTURES MARKET IS IN BACKWARDATION,  E.G., WHEN THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS HIGHER THAN THE PRICE OF THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT, THE INVESTOR  WOULD BUY A NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT FOR A LOWER PRICE THAN THE CURRENT NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT. ASSUMING THE PRICE OF THE  NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WAS $49 PER BARREL, OR 2% CHEAPER THAN THE $50 NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT, THEN, HYPOTHETICALLY, AND  ASSUMING NO OTHER CHANGES (E.G., TO EITHER PREVAILING CRUDE OIL PRICES OR THE PRICE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SPOT PRICE, THE  NEAR MONTH CONTRACT AND THE NEXT MONTH CONTRACT, AND, IGNORING THE IMPACT OF COMMISSION COSTS AND THE INCOME EARNED ON CASH AND/OR  CASH EQUIVALENTS), THE VALUE OF THE $49 NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WOULD RISE TO $50 AS IT APPROACHES EXPIRATION. IN THIS EXAMPLE,  THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WOULD TEND TO OUTPERFORM THE SPOT PRICE OF CRUDE OIL. AS A RESULT,  IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR THE NEW NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT TO RISE 12% WHILE THE SPOT PRICE OF CRUDE OIL MAY HAVE RISEN  A LOWER AMOUNT, E.G., ONLY 10%. SIMILARLY, THE SPOT PRICE OF CRUDE OIL COULD HAVE FALLEN 10% WHILE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT  IN THE FUTURES CONTRACT MIGHT HAVE FALLEN ANOTHER AMOUNT, E.G., ONLY 8%. OVER TIME, IF BACKWARDATION REMAINED CONSTANT, THIS DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN THE SPOT PRICE AND THE FUTURES CONTRACT PRICE WOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE.  IF THE FUTURES MARKET IS IN CONTANGO, AN  INVESTOR WOULD BE BUYING A NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT FOR A HIGHER PRICE THAN THE CURRENT NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT.  AGAIN, ASSUMING THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS $50 PER BARREL, THE PRICE OF THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT MIGHT BE $51  PER BARREL, OR 2% MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE FRONT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT. HYPOTHETICALLY, AND ASSUMING NO OTHER CHANGES, THE VALUE  OF THE $51 NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WOULD FALL TO $50 AS IT APPROACHES EXPIRATION. IN THIS EXAMPLE, THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT  IN THE SECOND MONTH WOULD TEND TO UNDERPERFORM THE SPOT PRICE OF CRUDE OIL. AS A RESULT, IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR THE NEW NEAR  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT TO RISE ONLY 10% WHILE THE SPOT PRICE OF CRUDE OIL MAY HAVE RISEN A HIGHER AMOUNT, E.G., 12%. SIMILARLY,  THE SPOT PRICE OF CRUDE OIL COULD HAVE FALLEN 10% WHILE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE SECOND MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT MIGHT  HAVE FALLEN ANOTHER AMOUNT, E.G., 12%. OVER TIME, IF CONTANGO REMAINED CONSTANT, THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SPOT PRICE AND THE  FUTURES CONTRACT PRICE WOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE.  THE CHART BELOW COMPARES THE DAILY PRICE  OF THE NEAR MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT TO THE PRICE OF 13  TH  MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT (I.E.,  A CONTRACT ONE YEAR FORWARD) OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS. WHEN THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS HIGHER THAN THE PRICE  OF THE 13  TH  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT, THE MARKET WOULD BE DESCRIBED AS BEING IN BACKWARDATION. WHEN THE PRICE OF THE NEAR  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS LOWER THAN THE 13  TH  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT, THE MARKET WOULD BE DESCRIBED AS BEING IN CONTANGO.  ALTHOUGH THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT AND THE PRICE OF THE 13  TH  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT TEND TO  MOVE TOGETHER, IT CAN BE SEEN THAT AT TIMES THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT PRICES ARE HIGHER THAN THE 13  TH  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT  PRICES (BACKWARDATION) AND, AT OTHER TIMES, THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT PRICES ARE LOWER THAN THE 13  TH  MONTH FUTURES  CONTRACT PRICES (CONTANGO).  *PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS  27  AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO VIEW THE SAME DATA  IS TO SUBTRACT THE DOLLAR PRICE OF THE 13  TH  MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT FROM THE DOLLAR PRICE OF THE NEAR  MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT, AS SHOWN IN THE CHART BELOW. WHEN THE DIFFERENCE IS POSITIVE, THE MARKET IS IN BACKWARDATION.  WHEN THE DIFFERENCE IS NEGATIVE, THE MARKET IS IN CONTANGO. THE CRUDE OIL MARKET SPENT TIME IN BOTH BACKWARDATION AND CONTANGO  DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS.  *PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS  AN INVESTMENT IN A PORTFOLIO THAT OWNED  ONLY THE NEAR MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT WOULD LIKELY PRODUCE A DIFFERENT RESULT THAN AN INVESTMENT IN A PORTFOLIO THAT OWNED  AN EQUAL NUMBER OF EACH OF THE NEAR 12 MONTHS\u2019 OF CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. GENERALLY SPEAKING, WHEN THE CRUDE OIL FUTURES  MARKET IS IN BACKWARDATION, A PORTFOLIO OF ONLY THE NEAR MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT MAY TEND TO HAVE A HIGHER TOTAL RETURN  THAN A PORTFOLIO OF 12 MONTHS\u2019 OF THE CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT. CONVERSELY, IF THE CRUDE OIL FUTURES MARKET WAS IN CONTANGO,  THE PORTFOLIO CONTAINING ONLY 12 MONTHS\u2019 OF CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS MAY TEND TO OUTPERFORM THE PORTFOLIO HOLDING ONLY  THE NEAR MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT.  HISTORICALLY, THE CRUDE OIL FUTURES MARKETS  HAVE EXPERIENCED PERIODS OF CONTANGO AND BACKWARDATION, WITH BACKWARDATION BEING IN PLACE SOMEWHAT LESS OFTEN THAN CONTANGO SINCE  OIL FUTURES TRADING STARTED IN 1982. FOLLOWING THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE CRUDE OIL MARKET  MOVED INTO CONTANGO AND REMAINED IN CONTANGO FOR A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS. DURING PARTS OF 2009, THE LEVEL OF CONTANGO WAS UNUSUALLY  STEEP AS A COMBINATION OF SLACK U.S. AND GLOBAL DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND ISSUES INVOLVING THE PHYSICAL TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE  OF CRUDE OIL AT CUSHING, OKLAHOMA, THE PRIMARY PRICING POINT FOR OIL TRADED IN THE U.S., LED TO UNUSUALLY HIGH INVENTORIES OF CRUDE  OIL. A COMBINATION OF IMPROVED TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE CAPACITY, ALONG WITH GROWING DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL GLOBALLY, MODERATED  THE INVENTORY BUILD-UP AND LED TO REDUCED LEVELS OF CONTANGO BY 2011. HOWEVER, AT THE END OF NOVEMBER 2014, GLOBAL CRUDE OIL INVENTORIES  GREW RAPIDLY AFTER THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (\u201cOPEC\u201d) VOTED TO DEFEND ITS MARKET SHARE AGAINST  U.S. SHALE-OIL PRODUCERS, RESULTING IN ANOTHER PERIOD DURING WHICH THE CRUDE OIL MARKET REMAINED PRIMARILY IN CONTANGO. THIS PERIOD  OF CONTANGO CONTINUED THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2017. DECLINING GLOBAL CRUDE OIL INVENTORIES CAUSED THE MARKET TO FLIP INTO BACKWARDATION  AT THE BEGINNING OF 2018 THROUGH LATE OCTOBER 2018, AT WHICH POINT ONGOING SUPPLY GROWTH IN THE U.S., COMBINED WITH INCREASED OPEC  PRODUCTION, ONCE AGAIN LED MARKET PARTICIPANTS TO FEAR ANOTHER GLOBAL GLUT OF CRUDE OIL. THE CRUDE OIL MARKET REMAINED IN CONTANGO  THROUGH JUNE 30, 2019.  28  USCF BELIEVES THAT HOLDING FUTURES CONTRACTS  WHOSE EXPIRATION DATES ARE SPREAD OUT OVER A 12 MONTH PERIOD OF TIME WILL CAUSE THE TOTAL RETURN OF SUCH A PORTFOLIO TO VARY COMPARED  TO A PORTFOLIO THAT HOLDS ONLY A SINGLE MONTH\u2019S CONTRACT (SUCH AS THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT). IN PARTICULAR, USCF BELIEVES  THAT THE TOTAL RETURN OF A PORTFOLIO HOLDING CONTRACTS WITH A RANGE OF EXPIRATION MONTHS WILL BE IMPACTED DIFFERENTLY BY THE PRICE  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIFFERENT CONTRACT MONTHS OF THE SAME COMMODITY FUTURE COMPARED TO THE TOTAL RETURN OF A PORTFOLIO CONSISTING  OF THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT. USCF BELIEVES THAT BASED ON HISTORICAL EVIDENCE A PORTFOLIO THAT HELD FUTURES CONTRACTS WITH A RANGE  OF EXPIRATION DATES SPREAD OUT OVER A 12 MONTH PERIOD OF TIME WOULD TYPICALLY BE IMPACTED LESS BY THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF BACKWARDATION,  AND LESS BY THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CONTANGO, COMPARED TO A PORTFOLIO THAT HELD CONTRACTS OF A SINGLE NEAR MONTH. AS A RESULT, ABSENT  THE IMPACT OF ANY OTHER FACTORS, A PORTFOLIO OF 12 DIFFERENT MONTHLY CONTRACTS WOULD TEND TO HAVE A LOWER TOTAL RETURN THAN A NEAR  MONTH ONLY PORTFOLIO IN A BACKWARDATION MARKET AND A HIGHER TOTAL RETURN IN A CONTANGO MARKET. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE  THAT SUCH HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS WOULD PROVIDE THE SAME OR SIMILAR RESULTS IN THE FUTURE.  PERIODS OF CONTANGO OR BACKWARDATION DO  NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT USL\u2019S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE OF HAVING THE DAILY PERCENTAGE CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE NAV TRACK THE DAILY  PERCENTAGE CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS SINCE THE IMPACT OF BACKWARDATION AND CONTANGO TEND  TO EQUALLY IMPACT THE DAILY PERCENTAGE CHANGES IN PRICE OF BOTH USL\u2019S SHARES AND THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. IT  IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY WHETHER BACKWARDATION OR CONTANGO WILL OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. IT IS LIKELY  THAT BOTH CONDITIONS WILL OCCUR DURING DIFFERENT PERIODS.  CRUDE OIL MARKET.  DURING THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, CRUDE OIL PRICES TRADED IN A RANGE BETWEEN $45.41 TO $66.30. CRUDE OIL ROSE OVER 28.76% FROM THE END  OF 2018 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2019 FINISHING THE QUARTER AT $58.47. AS OF THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, U.S. CRUDE STORAGE  WAS 12% HIGHER THAN A YEAR AGO, AND 7% HIGHER THAN THE FIVE-YEAR AVERAGE LEVEL. STORAGE LEVELS ARE APPROXIMATELY 13% BELOW THE  ALL-TIME HIGH SET IN 2017. OPEC NATIONS AGREED IN NOVEMBER 2018 TO REDUCE DAILY SUPPLY BY 1.2 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY AND WERE  EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN THOSE CUTS AT THE CARTEL\u2019S SEMI-ANNUAL MEETING IN EARLY JULY. THE GROUP HAS BEEN AGGRESSIVE ABOUT MEETING  TARGET CUTS. DESPITE OPEC\u2019S CUTS, CONTINUED GROWTH IN US SHALE, FALLING DEMAND, SLOWING IN CHINA GDP GROWTH, AND IMPACT FROM  TRADE WARS CAUSED CRUDE PRICES TO MODERATE THIS QUARTER. WHILE CRUDE OIL PRICES HAVE EXHIBITED A DRAMATIC REVERSAL SINCE THE END  OF 2018, PRICES HAVE NOT YET RETURNED TO THE RECENT HIGH OF $76.41 SET ON OCTOBER 3, 2018. IF GLOBAL DEMAND AND DEMAND GROWTH STOPS  FALLING, THEN PRICES MAY STABILIZE IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2019. MEANWHILE, GEOPOLITICAL RISKS HAVE INCREASED, PARTICULARLY IN RESPECT  TO IRAN AND ITS THREATS TO DISRUPT ENERGY SHIPPING IN THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ.  CRUDE OIL PRICE MOVEMENTS IN COMPARISON  TO OTHER ENERGY COMMODITIES AND INVESTMENT CATEGORIES.  USCF BELIEVES THAT INVESTORS FREQUENTLY MEASURE THE DEGREE TO WHICH  PRICES OR TOTAL RETURNS OF ONE INVESTMENT OR ASSET CLASS MOVE UP OR DOWN IN VALUE IN CONCERT WITH ANOTHER INVESTMENT OR ASSET CLASS.  STATISTICALLY, SUCH A MEASURE IS USUALLY DONE BY MEASURING THE CORRELATION OF THE PRICE MOVEMENTS OF THE TWO DIFFERENT INVESTMENTS  OR ASSET CLASSES OVER SOME PERIOD OF TIME. THE CORRELATION IS SCALED BETWEEN 1 AND -1, WHERE 1 INDICATES THAT THE TWO INVESTMENT  OPTIONS MOVE UP OR DOWN IN PRICE OR VALUE TOGETHER, KNOWN AS \u201cPOSITIVE CORRELATION,\u201d AND -1 INDICATES THAT THEY MOVE  IN COMPLETELY OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS, KNOWN AS \u201cNEGATIVE CORRELATION.\u201d A CORRELATION OF 0 WOULD MEAN THAT THE MOVEMENTS  OF THE TWO ARE NEITHER POSITIVELY NOR NEGATIVELY CORRELATED, KNOWN AS \u201cNON-CORRELATION.\u201d THAT IS, THE INVESTMENT OPTIONS  SOMETIMES MOVE UP AND DOWN TOGETHER AND OTHER TIMES MOVE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.  29  FOR THE TEN-YEAR TIME PERIOD BETWEEN JUNE  30, 2009 AND JUNE 30, 2019, THE TABLE BELOW COMPARES THE MONTHLY MOVEMENTS OF CRUDE OIL PRICES VERSUS THE MONTHLY MOVEMENTS OF  THE PRICES OF SEVERAL OTHER ENERGY COMMODITIES, SUCH AS NATURAL GAS, DIESEL-HEATING OIL, AND UNLEADED GASOLINE, AS WELL AS SEVERAL  MAJOR NON-COMMODITY INVESTMENT ASSET CLASSES, SUCH AS LARGE CAP U.S. EQUITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT BONDS AND GLOBAL EQUITIES. IT CAN  BE SEEN THAT OVER THIS PARTICULAR TIME PERIOD, THE MOVEMENT OF CRUDE OIL ON A MONTHLY BASIS EXHIBITED STRONG CORRELATION WITH UNLEADED  GASOLINE AND DIESEL-HEATING OIL, MODERATE CORRELATION WITH THE MOVEMENTS OF LARGE CAP U.S. EQUITIES AND GLOBAL EQUITIES, LITTLE  CORRELATION WITH NATURAL GAS, AND MODERATE NEGATIVE CORRELATION WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT BONDS.  *PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS  U.S.  GOV\u2019T.

THE RESULTS PICTURED ABOVE WOULD  HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF A DIFFERENT RANGE OF DATES HAD BEEN SELECTED. USCF BELIEVES THAT CRUDE OIL HAS HISTORICALLY NOT DEMONSTRATED  A STRONG CORRELATION WITH EQUITIES OR BONDS OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME. HOWEVER, USCF ALSO BELIEVES THAT IN THE FUTURE IT IS POSSIBLE  THAT CRUDE OIL COULD HAVE LONG TERM CORRELATION RESULTS THAT INDICATE PRICES OF CRUDE OIL MORE CLOSELY TRACK THE MOVEMENTS OF EQUITIES  OR BONDS. IN ADDITION, USCF BELIEVES THAT, WHEN MEASURED OVER TIME PERIODS SHORTER THAN TEN YEARS, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOME PERIODS  WHERE THE CORRELATION OF CRUDE OIL TO EQUITIES AND BONDS WILL BE EITHER MORE STRONGLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED OR MORE STRONGLY NEGATIVELY  CORRELATED THAN THE LONG TERM HISTORICAL RESULTS SUGGEST.  THE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN CRUDE OIL, NATURAL  GAS, DIESEL-HEATING OIL AND GASOLINE ARE RELEVANT BECAUSE USCF ENDEAVORS TO INVEST USL\u2019S ASSETS IN OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS  AND OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS SO THAT DAILY CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS IN USL\u2019S PER SHARE NAV CORRELATE AS CLOSELY AS  POSSIBLE WITH DAILY CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS IN THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. IF CERTAIN OTHER FUEL-BASED  COMMODITY FUTURES CONTRACTS DO NOT CLOSELY CORRELATE WITH THE CRUDE-OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS, THEN THEIR USE COULD LEAD TO GREATER  TRACKING ERROR. AS NOTED ABOVE, USCF ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS IN THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL  FUTURES CONTRACTS WILL CLOSELY CORRELATE WITH CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS IN THE SPOT PRICE OF LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  PREPARATION OF THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN COMPLIANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  REQUIRES THE APPLICATION OF APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING RULES AND GUIDANCE, AS WELL AS THE USE OF ESTIMATES. USL'S APPLICATION  OF THESE POLICIES INVOLVES JUDGMENTS AND ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES USED.  USCF HAS EVALUATED THE NATURE AND TYPES  OF ESTIMATES THAT IT MAKES IN PREPARING USL'S CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES AND HAS DETERMINED THAT  THE VALUATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE NOT TRADED ON A UNITED STATES OR INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED FUTURES EXCHANGE (SUCH  AS FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OTC SWAPS) INVOLVES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY. THE VALUES WHICH ARE USED BY USL FOR ITS OIL  FUTURES CONTRACTS ARE PROVIDED BY ITS COMMODITY BROKER WHO USES MARKET PRICES WHEN AVAILABLE, WHILE OTC SWAPS ARE VALUED BASED  ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FROM OR PAID TO A THIRD PARTY IN SETTLEMENT OF THESE  DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS PRIOR TO THEIR DELIVERY DATE AND VALUED ON A DAILY BASIS. IN ADDITION, USL ESTIMATES INTEREST AND DIVIDEND  INCOME ON A DAILY BASIS USING PREVAILING RATES EARNED ON ITS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE ADJUSTED TO THE ACTUAL  AMOUNT RECEIVED ON A MONTHLY BASIS AND THE DIFFERENCE, IF ANY, IS NOT CONSIDERED MATERIAL.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  USL HAS NOT MADE, AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE  MAKING, USE OF BORROWINGS OR OTHER LINES OF CREDIT TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS. USL HAS MET, AND IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT USL  WILL CONTINUE TO MEET, ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS FROM THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE OF ITS INVESTMENTS, OR  FROM THE TREASURIES, CASH AND/OR CASH EQUIVALENTS THAT IT INTENDS TO HOLD AT ALL TIMES. USL'S LIQUIDITY NEEDS INCLUDE: REDEEMING  SHARES, PROVIDING MARGIN DEPOSITS FOR ITS EXISTING OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS OR THE PURCHASE OF ADDITIONAL OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS  AND POSTING COLLATERAL FOR ITS OTC SWAPS, IF APPLICABLE, AND PAYMENT OF ITS EXPENSES, SUMMARIZED BELOW UNDER  \u201cCONTRACTUAL  OBLIGATIONS.\u201d  USL CURRENTLY GENERATES CASH  PRIMARILY FROM: (I) THE SALE OF BASKETS CONSISTING OF 50,000 SHARES (\u201cCREATION BASKETS\u201d) AND (II) INCOME EARNED  ON TREASURIES, CASH AND/OR CASH EQUIVALENTS. USL HAS ALLOCATED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS NET ASSETS TO TRADING IN OIL INTERESTS. USL  INVESTS IN OIL INTERESTS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE WITHOUT BEING LEVERAGED OR UNABLE TO SATISFY ITS CURRENT OR POTENTIAL  MARGIN OR COLLATERAL OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO ITS INVESTMENTS IN OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS.  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF USL'S NAV IS HELD IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS THAT ARE USED AS MARGIN AND AS COLLATERAL FOR ITS  TRADING IN OIL INTERESTS. THE BALANCE OF THE ASSETS IS HELD IN USL'S ACCOUNT AT ITS CUSTODIAN BANK AND IN TREASURIES  AT THE FCM. INCOME RECEIVED FROM USL'S INVESTMENTS IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND TREASURIES IS PAID TO USL. DURING THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, USL'S EXPENSES DID NOT EXCEED THE INCOME USL EARNED AND THE CASH EARNED FROM THE SALE OF  CREATION BASKETS AND THE REDEMPTION OF REDEMPTION BASKETS. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, USL DID NOT USE OTHER ASSETS  TO PAY EXPENSES. TO THE EXTENT EXPENSES EXCEED INCOME, USL'S NAV WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.  31  USL'S INVESTMENTS IN OIL INTERESTS  MAY BE SUBJECT TO PERIODS OF ILLIQUIDITY BECAUSE OF MARKET CONDITIONS, REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS AND OTHER REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE,  MOST COMMODITY EXCHANGES LIMIT THE FLUCTUATIONS IN FUTURES CONTRACTS PRICES DURING A SINGLE DAY BY REGULATIONS REFERRED TO AS \u201cDAILY  LIMITS.\u201d DURING A SINGLE DAY, NO TRADES MAY BE EXECUTED AT PRICES BEYOND THE DAILY LIMIT. ONCE THE PRICE OF A FUTURES CONTRACT  HAS INCREASED OR DECREASED BY AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE DAILY LIMIT, POSITIONS IN THE CONTRACTS CAN NEITHER BE TAKEN NOR LIQUIDATED  UNLESS THE TRADERS ARE WILLING TO EFFECT TRADES AT OR WITHIN THE SPECIFIED DAILY LIMIT. SUCH MARKET CONDITIONS COULD PREVENT USL  FROM PROMPTLY LIQUIDATING ITS POSITIONS IN OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, USL DID NOT PURCHASE  OR LIQUIDATE ANY OF ITS POSITIONS WHILE DAILY LIMITS WERE IN EFFECT; HOWEVER, USL CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER SUCH AN EVENT  MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.  PRIOR TO THE INITIAL OFFERING OF USL, ALL  PAYMENTS WITH RESPECT TO USL\u2019S EXPENSES WERE PAID BY USCF. USL DOES NOT HAVE AN OBLIGATION OR INTENTION TO REFUND SUCH PAYMENTS  BY USCF. USCF IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PAY USL\u2019S CURRENT OR FUTURE EXPENSES. SINCE THE INITIAL OFFERING OF SHARES, USL HAS  BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPENSES RELATING TO: (I) MANAGEMENT FEES, (II) BROKERAGE FEES AND COMMISSIONS, (III) LICENSING FEES FOR THE  USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, (IV) ONGOING REGISTRATION EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH OFFERS AND SALES OF ITS SHARES SUBSEQUENT TO  THE INITIAL OFFERING, (V) OTHER EXPENSES, INCLUDING TAX REPORTING COSTS, (VI) FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF  USCF AND (VII) OTHER EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES NOT IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHILE USCF HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPENSES  RELATING TO THE FEES OF USL'S MARKETING AGENT, ADMINISTRATOR AND CUSTODIAN AND REGISTRATION EXPENSES RELATING TO THE INITIAL OFFERING  OF SHARES. IF USCF AND USL ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN RAISING SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO COVER THESE RESPECTIVE EXPENSES OR IN LOCATING ANY OTHER  SOURCE OF FUNDING, USL WILL TERMINATE AND INVESTORS MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF THEIR INVESTMENT.  MARKET RISK  TRADING IN OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AND  OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS FORWARDS, INVOLVES USL ENTERING INTO CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE OR SELL OIL  AT A SPECIFIED DATE IN THE FUTURE. THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED USL'S FUTURE CASH  REQUIREMENTS SINCE USL INTENDS TO CLOSE OUT ITS OPEN POSITIONS PRIOR TO SETTLEMENT. AS A RESULT, USL IS GENERALLY ONLY  SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS. USL CONSIDERS THE \u201cFAIR VALUE\u201d  OF ITS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO BE THE UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE CONTRACTS. THE MARKET RISK ASSOCIATED WITH USL'S COMMITMENTS  TO PURCHASE OIL IS LIMITED TO THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS HELD. HOWEVER, SHOULD USL ENTER INTO A CONTRACTUAL  COMMITMENT TO SELL OIL, IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE DELIVERY OF THE OIL AT THE CONTRACT PRICE, REPURCHASE THE CONTRACT AT PREVAILING  PRICES OR SETTLE IN CASH. SINCE THERE ARE NO LIMITS ON THE FUTURE PRICE OF OIL, THE MARKET RISK TO USL COULD BE UNLIMITED.  USL'S EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK DEPENDS  ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE MARKETS FOR OIL, THE VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, THE LIQUIDITY  OF THE OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS MARKETS AND THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE CONTRACTS HELD BY USL.  DRASTIC MARKET OCCURRENCES COULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE LOSS OF ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF AN INVESTOR\u2019S CAPITAL.  CREDIT RISK  WHEN USL ENTERS INTO OIL FUTURES  CONTRACTS AND OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS, IT IS EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK THAT THE COUNTERPARTY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET ITS  OBLIGATIONS. THE COUNTERPARTY FOR THE OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE NYMEX AND ON MOST OTHER FUTURES EXCHANGES IS  THE CLEARINGHOUSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PARTICULAR EXCHANGE. IN GENERAL, IN ADDITION TO MARGIN REQUIRED TO BE POSTED BY THE CLEARINGHOUSE  IN CONNECTION WITH CLEARED TRADES, CLEARINGHOUSES ARE BACKED BY THEIR MEMBERS WHO MAY BE REQUIRED TO SHARE IN THE FINANCIAL BURDEN  RESULTING FROM THE NONPERFORMANCE OF ONE OF THEIR MEMBERS AND, THEREFORE, THIS ADDITIONAL MEMBER SUPPORT SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE  CREDIT RISK. USL IS NOT CURRENTLY A MEMBER OF ANY CLEARINGHOUSE. SOME FOREIGN EXCHANGES ARE NOT BACKED BY THEIR CLEARINGHOUSE  MEMBERS BUT MAY BE BACKED BY A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, USL FACES THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE  BY ANY COUNTERPARTIES TO OTC CONTRACTS. UNLIKE IN THE CASE OF EXCHANGE-TRADED FUTURES CONTRACTS, THE COUNTERPARTY TO AN OTC CONTRACT  IS GENERALLY A SINGLE BANK OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. AS A RESULT, THERE WILL BE GREATER COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK IN OTC TRANSACTIONS.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY COUNTERPARTY, CLEARINGHOUSE, OR THEIR MEMBERS OR THEIR FINANCIAL BACKERS WILL SATISFY THEIR  OBLIGATIONS TO USL IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.  USCF ATTEMPTS TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK  OF USL BY FOLLOWING VARIOUS TRADING LIMITATIONS AND POLICIES. IN PARTICULAR, USL GENERALLY POSTS MARGIN AND/OR HOLDS  LIQUID ASSETS THAT ARE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE MARKET VALUE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS TO COUNTERPARTIES UNDER THE OIL FUTURES  CONTRACTS AND OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS IT HOLDS. USCF HAS IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES THAT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO,  EXECUTING AND CLEARING TRADES ONLY WITH CREDITWORTHY PARTIES AND/OR REQUIRING THE POSTING OF COLLATERAL OR MARGIN BY SUCH PARTIES  FOR THE BENEFIT OF USL TO LIMIT ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE. AN FCM, WHEN ACTING ON BEHALF OF USL IN ACCEPTING ORDERS TO PURCHASE  OR SELL OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS ON UNITED STATES EXCHANGES, IS REQUIRED BY CFTC REGULATIONS TO SEPARATELY ACCOUNT FOR AND SEGREGATE  AS BELONGING TO USL, ALL ASSETS OF USL RELATING TO DOMESTIC OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADING. THESE FCMS ARE NOT ALLOWED  TO COMMINGLE USL'S ASSETS WITH THEIR OTHER ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THE CFTC REQUIRES FCMS TO HOLD IN A SECURE ACCOUNT USL'S  ASSETS RELATED TO FOREIGN OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADING.  32  IN THE FUTURE, USL MAY PURCHASE OTC  SWAPS, SEE  \u201cITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\u201d  IN THIS QUARTERLY  REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR A DISCUSSION OF OTC SWAPS.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, USL HELD CASH  DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS IN TREASURIES AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS IN THE AMOUNT OF $57,233,158 WITH THE CUSTODIAN AND FCM. SOME OR  ALL OF THESE AMOUNTS HELD BY A CUSTODIAN OR AN FCM, AS APPLICABLE, MAY BE SUBJECT TO LOSS SHOULD USL'S CUSTODIAN OR FCM, AS  APPLICABLE, CEASE OPERATIONS.  OFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, USL HAD NO LOAN  GUARANTEE, CREDIT SUPPORT OR OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OF ANY KIND OTHER THAN AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO IN THE NORMAL  COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN RISKS THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS UNDERTAKE IN  PERFORMING SERVICES WHICH ARE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF USL. WHILE USL'S EXPOSURE UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS CANNOT  BE ESTIMATED, THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON USL'S FINANCIAL POSITION.  EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT  USL HAD NO DIRECT EXPOSURE TO EUROPEAN  SOVEREIGN DEBT AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 AND HAS NO DIRECT EXPOSURE TO EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT AS OF THE FILING OF THIS QUARTERLY  REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  REDEMPTION BASKET OBLIGATION  IN ORDER TO MEET ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE  AND PAY ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS DESCRIBED BELOW, USL REQUIRES LIQUIDITY TO REDEEM SHARES, WHICH REDEMPTIONS MUST BE IN  BLOCKS OF 50,000 SHARES CALLED \u201cREDEMPTION BASKETS.\u201d USL HAS TO DATE SATISFIED THIS OBLIGATION BY PAYING  FROM THE CASH OR CASH EQUIVALENTS IT HOLDS OR THROUGH THE SALE OF ITS TREASURIES IN AN AMOUNT PROPORTIONATE TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES  BEING REDEEMED.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  USL'S PRIMARY CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  ARE WITH USCF. IN RETURN FOR ITS SERVICES, USCF IS ENTITLED TO A MANAGEMENT FEE CALCULATED DAILY AND PAID MONTHLY AS A FIXED PERCENTAGE  OF USL'S NAV, CURRENTLY 0.60% OF NAV ON ITS AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS.  USCF AGREED TO PAY THE START-UP COSTS ASSOCIATED  WITH THE FORMATION OF USL, PRIMARILY ITS LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH USCF\u2019S REGISTRATION WITH THE  CFTC AS A CPO AND THE REGISTRATION AND LISTING OF USL AND ITS SHARES WITH THE SEC, FINRA AND NYSE ARCA (FORMERLY, AMEX), RESPECTIVELY.  HOWEVER, SINCE USL\u2019S INITIAL OFFERING OF SHARES, OFFERING COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH REGISTERING AND LISTING ADDITIONAL  SHARES OF USL HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY BORNE ON AN ONGOING BASIS BY USL, AND NOT BY USCF.  USCF PAYS THE FEES OF THE MARKETING AGENT  AND THE FEES OF BBH&CO., AS WELL AS BBH&CO.\u2019S FEES FOR PERFORMING ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES, INCLUDING THOSE IN CONNECTION  WITH THE PREPARATION OF USL'S CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ITS SEC, NFA AND CFTC REPORTS. USCF AND USL HAVE ALSO ENTERED  INTO A LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH THE NYMEX PURSUANT TO WHICH USL AND THE RELATED PUBLIC FUNDS, OTHER THAN BNO, USCI, CPER, USOU  AND USOD, PAY A LICENSING FEE TO THE NYMEX. USL ALSO PAYS THE FEES AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS TAX ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS.  IN ADDITION TO USCF\u2019S MANAGEMENT  FEE, USL PAYS ITS BROKERAGE FEES (INCLUDING FEES TO AN FCM), OTC DEALER SPREADS, ANY LICENSING FEES FOR THE USE OF INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY, AND, SUBSEQUENT TO THE INITIAL OFFERING, REGISTRATION AND OTHER FEES PAID TO THE SEC, FINRA, OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES  IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFER AND SALE OF SHARES, AS WELL AS LEGAL, PRINTING, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED THEREWITH,  AND EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES. THE LATTER ARE EXPENSES NOT INCURRED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF USL\u2019S BUSINESS, INCLUDING EXPENSES  RELATING TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OF ANY PERSON AGAINST LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND UNDER THE  LP AGREEMENT, THE BRINGING OR DEFENDING OF ACTIONS IN LAW OR IN EQUITY OR OTHERWISE CONDUCTING LITIGATION AND INCURRING LEGAL EXPENSES  AND THE SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION. COMMISSION PAYMENTS TO AN FCM ARE ON A CONTRACT-BY-CONTRACT, OR ROUND TURN, BASIS.  USL ALSO PAYS A PORTION OF THE FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF USCF. SEE  NOTE 3  TO THE  NOTES TO CONDENSED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  IN  ITEM 1  OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  THE PARTIES CANNOT ANTICIPATE THE AMOUNT  OF PAYMENTS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS FOR FUTURE PERIODS, AS USL'S PER SHARE NAVS AND TRADING LEVELS  TO MEET ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL A FUTURE DATE. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR A SPECIFIC TERM AGREED  UPON BY THE PARTIES WITH AN OPTION TO RENEW, OR, IN SOME CASES, ARE IN EFFECT FOR THE DURATION OF USL'S EXISTENCE. EITHER  PARTY MAY TERMINATE THESE AGREEMENTS EARLIER FOR CERTAIN REASONS DESCRIBED IN THE AGREEMENTS.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, USL'S PORTFOLIO  CONSISTED OF 949 CRUDE OIL FUTURES CL CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE NYMEX. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, USL DID NOT HOLD ANY OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS  TRADED ON THE ICE FUTURES.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REFERENCES  MADE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q TO \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cOUR,\u201d \u201cUS,\u201d \u201cINTELLICHECK,\u201d  OR THE \u201cCOMPANY,\u201d REFER TO INTELLICHECK, INC.  THE  FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSTITUTES MANAGEMENT\u2019S REVIEW OF  THE FACTORS THAT AFFECTED OUR FINANCIAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. THIS DISCUSSION  SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO CONTAINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT AND IN OUR ANNUAL  REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. ON DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE MERGED OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, MOBILISA,  INC. (\u201cMOBILISA\u201d) AND POSITIVE ACCESS CORPORATION (\u201cPOSITIVE ACCESS\u201d) INTO ONE COMPANY UNDER INTELLICHECK.  AS OF AND PRIOR TO DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE CONSOLIDATED AND INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF INTELLICHECK AND THESE  SUBSIDIARIES. ALL INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED UPON CONSOLIDATION.  OVERVIEW  WE  ARE A PROMINENT TECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT IS ENGAGED IN DEVELOPING, INTEGRATING AND MARKETING IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION AND THREAT  IDENTIFICATION SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES THAT INCLUDE BANK AND RETAIL FRAUD PREVENTION, LAW ENFORCEMENT THREAT IDENTIFICATION,  AND MOBILE AND HANDHELD ACCESS CONTROL AND SECURITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT, MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS. OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE  RETAIL ID\u00ae, A SOLUTION FOR PREVENTING FRAUD IN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY; AGE ID\u00ae, A SMARTPHONE OR TABLET-BASED SOLUTION FOR  PREVENTING SALE OF AGE-RESTRICTED PRODUCTS TO MINORS; LAW ID\u00ae, A SMARTPHONE-BASED SOLUTION USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS  TO IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE THREATS; AND DEFENSE ID\u00ae, A MOBILE AND FIXED INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTION FOR THREAT IDENTIFICATION, IDENTITY  AUTHENTICATION AND ACCESS CONTROL TO MILITARY BASES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT FACILITIES.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE USE OF ESTIMATES  THE  PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED  STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS INCLUDE IMPAIRMENT CONSIDERATION AND VALUATION OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES,  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  PLANS. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN MAKING ESTIMATES, ACTUAL RESULTS REPORTED IN FUTURE PERIODS MAY BE DIFFERENT  FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  18  WE  BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING OUR HISTORICAL AND FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AS  THESE POLICIES AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND THE MORE SIGNIFICANT AREAS INVOLVING MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENTS AND  ESTIMATES. THESE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES RELATE TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, DEFERRED TAXES AND COMMITMENTS  AND CONTINGENCIES. THESE POLICIES AND OUR PROCEDURES RELATED TO THESE POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL BELOW.  GOODWILL  THE  EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES IS CONSIDERED GOODWILL. UNDER AUTHORITATIVE  GUIDANCE, PURCHASED GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT RATHER IT IS PERIODICALLY REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT. WE HAD GOODWILL OF $8,101,661  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019. THIS GOODWILL RESULTED FROM THE ACQUISITIONS OF MOBILISA AND POSITIVE ACCESS.  FOR  THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. UNDER AUTHORITATIVE  GUIDANCE, WE CAN USE INDUSTRY AND COMPANY SPECIFIC QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT IMPAIRMENT  EXISTS, BEFORE USING A TWO-STEP QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS. EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH COULD TRIGGER AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW  INCLUDE MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS, COST FACTORS, OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, OTHER ENTITY SPECIFIC  EVENTS AND SUSTAINED DECREASE IN SHARE PRICE. WE PERFORMED THE FIRST STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY  POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING OUR FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY TO OUR CARRYING AMOUNT, INCLUDING GOODWILL. THE FAIR VALUE WAS  DETERMINED USING THE WEIGHTING OF CERTAIN VALUATION TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING BOTH INCOME AND MARKET APPROACHES WHICH INCLUDE A DISCOUNTED  CASH FLOW ANALYSIS, AN ESTIMATION OF AN IMPLIED CONTROL PREMIUM, IN ADDITION TO OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE.  THE IMPLIED CONTROL PREMIUM SELECTED WAS DEVELOPED BASED ON CERTAIN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES. THE MARKET  CAPITALIZATION IS SENSITIVE TO THE VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK PRICE. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT THE FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE IMPAIRMENT  ANALYSIS ARE REASONABLE, CHANGES IN ANY ONE OF THE ASSUMPTIONS USED COULD HAVE PRODUCED A DIFFERENT RESULT WHICH MAY HAVE LED  TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. ANY FUTURE IMPAIRMENT LOSS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LONG-TERM ASSETS AND OPERATING  EXPENSES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IMPAIRMENT IS DETERMINED TO EXIST.  FOR  THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR VALUE WAS MORE THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AND THEREFORE THE SECOND  STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WAS NOT REQUIRED.  WE  DETERMINED THAT NO EVENTS OCCURRED OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGED DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN  NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNTS. WE WILL, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR STOCK PRICE AND  OPERATIONS FOR ANY POTENTIAL INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT. WE WILL CONDUCT THE 2019 ANNUAL TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT IN THE FOURTH  QUARTER, OR AT SUCH TIME WHERE AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT APPEARS TO EXIST.  INTANGIBLE  ASSETS  OUR  INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST OF TRADE NAMES, PATENTS AND NON-CONTRACTUAL CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. WE DETERMINED THAT NO EVENTS OCCURRED  OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGED DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS  BELOW OUR CARRYING AMOUNTS. WE WILL, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO MONITOR ANY POTENTIAL INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT.  REVENUE  RECOGNITION AND DEFERRED REVENUE  THE  MAJORITY OF LICENSE FEES AND SERVICES REVENUE ARE GENERATED FROM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS, WHICH PROVIDE FOR LICENSES TO SOFTWARE  PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMIZE SUCH SOFTWARE TO MEET THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 USE. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, CUSTOMIZATION SERVICES  ARE DETERMINED TO BE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE DELIVERED SOFTWARE. UNDER ASC 606, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN A CUSTOMER  OBTAINS CONTROL OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE  FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. WE MEASURE REVENUE BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION SPECIFIED IN A CUSTOMER ARRANGEMENT, AND REVENUE IS  RECOGNIZED WHEN THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN AN ARRANGEMENT ARE SATISFIED. A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS A PROMISE IN A CONTRACT  TO TRANSFER A DISTINCT SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER. THE TRANSACTION PRICE OF A CONTRACT IS ALLOCATED TO EACH DISTINCT PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATION AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN OR AS, THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE BENEFIT OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. CUSTOMERS TYPICALLY  RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF OUR SERVICES AS THEY ARE PERFORMED. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CUSTOMER CONTRACTS PROVIDE THAT WE ARE COMPENSATED  FOR SERVICES PERFORMED TO DATE.  19  INVOICING  IS BASED ON SCHEDULES ESTABLISHED IN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS. PAYMENT TERMS ARE GENERALLY ESTABLISHED AT 30 DAYS FROM THE INVOICE DATE.  PRODUCT RETURNS ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE.  REVENUE  IS MEASURED BASED ON A CONSIDERATION SPECIFIED IN A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER, AND EXCLUDES ANY SALES INCENTIVES AND AMOUNTS COLLECTED  ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES. REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER,  IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. FURTHERMORE,  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN WE SATISFY A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BY TRANSFERRING CONTROL OVER A PRODUCT OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER.  STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION  WE  ACCOUNT FOR THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC TOPIC 718 AND 505, WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE COST  RESULTING FROM ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS PRONOUNCEMENT ESTABLISHES  FAIR VALUE AS THE MEASUREMENT OBJECTIVE IN ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND REQUIRES ALL COMPANIES TO APPLY  A FAIR VALUE BASED MEASUREMENT METHOD IN ACCOUNTING FOR ALL SHARE BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS WITH EMPLOYEES.  DEFERRED  INCOME TAXES  DEFERRED  TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL  STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES AND NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY FORWARDS.  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING EXPECTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR THE YEAR IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES  ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED. WE HAVE RECORDED A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AS OF JUNE  30, 2019, DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THOSE ASSETS.  COMMITMENTS  AND CONTINGENCIES  WE  ARE NOT CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.  THE  ABOVE LISTING IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ALL OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES. IN MANY CASES, THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT  OF A PARTICULAR TRANSACTION IS SPECIFICALLY DICTATED BY GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, WITH NO NEED FOR MANAGEMENT\u2019S  JUDGMENT IN THEIR APPLICATION. THERE ARE ALSO AREAS IN WHICH MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT IN SELECTING ANY AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVE  WOULD NOT PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULT.  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  (ALL FIGURES HAVE BEEN ROUNDED TO THE NEAREST $1,000)  COMPARISON  OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  REVENUES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 INCREASED 56% TO $1,558,000 COMPARED TO $1,001,000 FOR THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THE INCREASE  IN REVENUES IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER COMMERCIAL REVENUES OFFSET BY A DECREASE  IN DEFENSE ID  \u00ae  REVENUES. SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE (\u201cSAAS\u201d) REVENUE, WHICH CONSISTS OF SOFTWARE LICENSED  ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS, INCREASED $496,000 OR 79% TO $1,121,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $625,000  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  GROSS  PROFIT INCREASED BY $420,000 TO $1,339,000 FOR THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $919,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE  30, 2018. OUR GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES, WAS 85.9% AND 91.8% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018,  RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN PERCENTAGE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED HOSTING COSTS ON OUR SAAS REVENUE. AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY  OUR MARGINS, ARE EXPECTED TO NORMALIZE IN THE 85% RANGE.  20  OPERATING  EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST OF SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, INCREASED $196,000 OR 10%  TO $2,259,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $2,063,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THIS INCREASE  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT FOR DEVELOPMENT PERSONNEL, LEGAL FEES AND A NEW ANNUAL EXECUTIVE BONUS PLAN BASED  ON CERTAIN GOALS ACHIEVED BY US PLUS INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENTS BY EACH EXECUTIVE.  INTEREST  AND OTHER INCOME WAS INSIGNIFICANT IN THE THREE MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018.  WE  HAVE INCURRED NET LOSSES TO DATE; THEREFORE, WE HAVE PAID NOMINAL INCOME TAXES.  AS  A RESULT OF THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY GENERATED A NET LOSS OF $874,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED  TO A NET LOSS OF $1,100,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  COMPARISON  OF THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  REVENUES  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 INCREASED 37% TO $2,837,000 COMPARED TO $2,063,000 FOR THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THE INCREASE  IN REVENUES IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER COMMERCIAL REVENUES OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN  DEFENSE ID  \u00ae  REVENUES. SAAS REVENUE INCREASED $763,000 OR 63% TO $1,982,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO $1,219,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  GROSS  PROFIT INCREASED BY $545,000 TO $2,426,000 FOR SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $1,881,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2018. OUR GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES, WAS 85.5% AND 91.1% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE IN PERCENTAGE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED HOSTING COSTS ON OUR SAAS REVENUE. AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY OUR MARGINS,  ARE EXPECTED TO NORMALIZE IN THE 85% RANGE.  OPERATING  EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST OF SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, INCREASED $458,000 OR 11%  TO $4,564,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $4,106,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THIS INCREASE  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS, AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT FOR DEVELOPMENT PERSONNEL AND A NEW ANNUAL  EXECUTIVE BONUS PLAN BASED ON CERTAIN GOALS ACHIEVED BY US PLUS INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENTS BY EACH EXECUTIVE.  INTEREST  AND OTHER INCOME WAS INSIGNIFICANT IN THE SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018.  WE  HAVE INCURRED NET LOSSES TO DATE; THEREFORE, WE HAVE PAID NOMINAL INCOME TAXES.  AS  A RESULT OF THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY GENERATED A NET LOSS OF $2,087,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED  TO A NET LOSS OF $2,168,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  (ALL FIGURES HAVE BEEN ROUNDED TO THE NEAREST $1,000)  AS  OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD CASH OF $3,061,000, WORKING CAPITAL (DEFINED AS CURRENT ASSETS MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES) OF $2,884,000,  TOTAL ASSETS OF $13,436,000 AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY OF $11,543,000.  DURING  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE USED NET CASH OF $1,597,000 IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS COMPARED TO NET CASH USED OF $2,128,000  IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $14,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO CASH USED INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $108,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  WAS $268,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $688,000 FOR THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  ON  FEBRUARY 6, 2019 WE ENTERED INTO A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH CITIBANK THAT ALLOWS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO THE LESSER OF (I)  $2,000,000 OR (II) THE COLLATERALIZED BALANCE IN OUR EXISTING FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT ACCOUNT WITH CITIBANK. THE FACILITY BEARS  INTEREST AT A RATE CONSISTENT OF CITIBANK\u2019S BASE RATE (7% AT JUNE 30, 2019) MINUS 2% SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. INTEREST  IS PAYABLE MONTHLY AND AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THERE WERE NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS FACILITY AND UNUSED AVAILABILITY UNDER  THIS FACILITY WAS $2,000,000.  21  WE  CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH, EXPECTED CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT,  WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  WE  KEEP THE OPTION OPEN TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO RESPOND TO BUSINESS CONTINGENCIES WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE NEED TO FUND MORE RAPID  EXPANSION, FUND ADDITIONAL MARKETING EXPENDITURES, DEVELOP NEW MARKETS FOR OUR TECHNOLOGY, ENHANCE OUR OPERATING INFRASTRUCTURE,  RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, OR ACQUIRE COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES OR NECESSARY TECHNOLOGIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT  WE WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN NEEDED OR OBTAIN SUCH ON TERMS SATISFACTORY TO US, IF AT ALL.  WE  HAVE FILED A UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d),  WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JULY 19, 2010. UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, WE MAY OFFER AND SELL, FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE  FUTURE IN ONE OR MORE PUBLIC OFFERINGS, OUR COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK, WARRANTS, AND UNITS. THE AGGREGATE INITIAL OFFERING  PRICE OF ALL SECURITIES SOLD BY US WILL NOT EXCEED $25,000,000, AND, PURSUANT TO SEC RULES, WE MAY ONLY SELL UP TO ONE-THIRD OF  THE MARKET CAP HELD BY NON-AFFILIATE STOCKHOLDERS IN ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD. WE RENEWED THIS REGISTRATION WITH THE SEC ON OCTOBER  21, 2016 AND IT WAS DECLARED EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 4, 2016.  THE  SPECIFIC TERMS OF ANY FUTURE OFFERING, INCLUDING THE PRICES AND USE OF PROCEEDS, WILL BE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF ANY SUCH OFFERING  AND WILL BE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL IN A PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT WHICH WILL BE FILED WITH THE SEC AT THE TIME OF THE OFFERING.  THE  SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT IS DESIGNED TO GIVE THE COMPANY THE FLEXIBILITY TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AT SOME POINT IN THE  FUTURE WHEN MARKET CONDITIONS ARE APPROPRIATE.  WE  ARE NOT CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN ANY LEGAL OR REGULATORY PROCEEDING, OR ARBITRATION, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL  EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.  NET  OPERATING LOSS CARRY FORWARDS  OUR  AVAILABLE NET OPERATING LOSS (\u201cNOL\u201d) AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION. THE FEDERAL AND STATE NOL\u2019S  INCURRED IN ALL YEARS THROUGH 2017 ARE AVAILABLE TO OFFSET FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND EXPIRE FROM 2019 THROUGH 2038 IF NOT UTILIZED.  THE 2018 GROSS NOL INCURRED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 CAN BE UTILIZED AT 80% WITH NO EXPIRATION.  ADJUSTED  EBITDA  WE  USE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CALCULATED BY ADDING BACK TO NET LOSS,  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, INCOME TAXES, IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION EXPENSE. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS PROVIDED TO INVESTORS TO SUPPLEMENT THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE  WITH GAAP. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADJUSTED EBITDA PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL TOOL FOR INVESTORS TO USE IN COMPARING OUR FINANCIAL  RESULTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES THAT ALSO USE ADJUSTED EBITDA IN THEIR COMMUNICATIONS TO INVESTORS. BY EXCLUDING NON-CASH CHARGES  SUCH AS IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL, AMORTIZATION, DEPRECIATION AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AS WELL AS NON-OPERATING  CHARGES FOR INTEREST AND INCOME TAXES, INVESTORS CAN EVALUATE OUR OPERATIONS AND CAN COMPARE THE RESULTS ON A MORE CONSISTENT  BASIS TO THE RESULTS OF OTHER COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY MEASURES MANAGEMENT USES TO MONITOR  AND EVALUATE FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS.  WE  CONSIDER ADJUSTED EBITDA TO BE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF OUR OPERATIONAL STRENGTH AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS AND A USEFUL  MEASURE OF OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING TRENDS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS TO THE USE OF ADJUSTED EBITDA SINCE IT  EXCLUDES INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, ALL OF WHICH  IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY, AS WELL AS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION RELATED TO THE USE OF LONG-TERM ASSETS WHICH BENEFIT MULTIPLE  PERIODS. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE LIMITATIONS ARE COMPENSATED BY PROVIDING ADJUSTED EBITDA ONLY WITH GAAP NET LOSS AND CLEARLY IDENTIFYING  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO MEASURES. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE  FOR NET LOSS PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. ADJUSTED EBITDA AS DEFINED BY US MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE WITH SIMILARLY NAMED MEASURES  PROVIDED BY OTHER ENTITIES.  22  A  RECONCILIATION OF GAAP NET LOSS TO NON-GAAP ADJUSTED EBITDA FOLLOWS.

THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ADDITION OF ONE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOAN TOTALING $2.4 MILLION BEING PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS.  IN 2016, THE CORPORATION PURCHASED A PARTICIPATION INTEREST IN THIS LOAN FROM ANOTHER LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.  THE PROCEEDS OF THE LOAN, WHICH WAS ORIGINATED AS A CONSTRUCTION LOAN WITH A PERMANENT FINANCING MORTGAGE LOAN UPON COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION, WAS USED BY THE BORROWER TO CONSTRUCT AN APARTMENT COMPLEX LOCATED IN BEAVER COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE DEVELOPER OF THE PROPERTY WAS INDICTED ON MULTIPLE CHARGES OF FRAUD. ALSO, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE FINANCIALS INITIALLY PROVIDED TO OBTAIN THE FINANCING FOR THE PROJECT MAY HAVE CONTAINED FRAUDULENT INFORMATION WHICH CAUSED THE LEAD BANK TO DEMAND THAT THE OUTSTANDING LOAN BE PAID IN FULL.  IN ADDITION, THE LEAD LENDER COMMENCED FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS AND THE PROPERTY WAS PLACED INTO RECEIVERSHIP DURING THE QUARTER. AT JUNE 30, 2019, THE LOAN WAS IN ARREARS AND THEREFORE CONSIDERED A NONPERFORMING LOAN.

THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO TWO ADDITIONAL COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS TOTALING $4.9 MILLION BEING CLASSIFIED AS SUBSTANDARD IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.  THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES DECREASED $30,000, OR 10.0%, TO $270,000 FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  FROM $300,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  AS LOAN BALANCES DECLINED $8.5 MILLION DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  . THE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED $2.4 MILLION COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP WHICH WAS DOWNGRADED TO SUBSTANDARD AND PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WAS INDIVIDUALLY EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT AND BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ANALYSIS OF THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL PLEDGED ON THE LOAN, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NO ADDITIONAL PROVISION WAS REQUIRED WITH RESPECT TO SUCH LOAN. THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES RECORDED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  WAS HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO OF $3.0 MILLION.  NONINTEREST INCOME.  NONINTEREST INCOME INCREASED $82,000, OR 7.8%, TO $1.1 MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO $1.0 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .

NONINTEREST EXPENSE.  NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $85,000, OR 1.6%, TO $5.3 MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  FROM $5.2 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THE INCREASE PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCREASES IN COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSE AND OTHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $266,000 AND $227,000, RESPECTIVELY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN ACQUISTION COSTS OF $358,000.   THE INCREASES PRIMARILY RELATED TO COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED NEW BANKING OFFICES AND NORMAL SALARY AND BENEFIT AND OPERATING EXPENSE INCREASES.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  .

THIS CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER WAS PHASED IN BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2016 AT 0.625% OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AND HAS INCREASED EACH SUBSEQUENT YEAR BY AN ADDITIONAL 0.625% UNTIL REACHING ITS FINAL LEVEL OF 2.5% ON JANUARY 1, 2019. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR REGULATORY CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS WERE ALSO IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE FINAL RULES. THE FINAL RULES ALSO REVISED THE DEFINITION AND CALCULATION OF TIER 1 CAPITAL, TOTAL CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. THE PHASE-IN PERIOD FOR THE FINAL RULES BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2015 WITH FULL COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE FINAL RULES\u2019 REQUIREMENTS PHASED IN OVER A MULTI-YEAR SCHEDULE WHICH WAS FULLY PHASED-IN ON JANUARY 1, 2019.  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE BANK EXCEEDED ALL MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER THESE CAPITAL GUIDELINES.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE CORPORATION\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND FOLLOW GENERAL PRACTICES WITHIN THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH IT OPERATES. APPLICATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS OF THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; ACCORDINGLY, AS THIS INFORMATION CHANGES, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COULD REFLECT DIFFERENT ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS. CERTAIN POLICIES INHERENTLY HAVE A GREATER RELIANCE ON THE USE OF ESTIMATES, AND AS SUCH HAVE A GREATER POSSIBILITY OF PRODUCING RESULTS THAT COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN ORIGINALLY REPORTED. ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, WHEN A DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF AN ASSET NOT CARRIED ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT FAIR VALUE WARRANTS AN IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWN OR VALUATION RESERVE TO BE ESTABLISHED OR WHEN AN ASSET OR LIABILITY NEEDS TO BE RECORDED CONTINGENT UPON A FUTURE EVENT. CARRYING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE INHERENTLY RESULTS IN MORE FINANCIAL STATEMENT VOLATILITY. THE FAIR VALUES AND THE INFORMATION USED TO RECORD VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE BASED EITHER ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR ARE PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, WHEN AVAILABLE. WHEN THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE ESTIMATED IN GOOD FAITH BY MANAGEMENT PRIMARILY THOUGH THE USE OF INTERNAL CASH FLOW MODELING TECHNIQUES.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOLLOWED BY THE CORPORATION ARE PRESENTED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE CORPORATION\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THESE POLICIES, ALONG WITH THE DISCLOSURES PRESENTED IN THE OTHER FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HOW SIGNIFICANT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE VALUED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND HOW THOSE VALUES ARE DETERMINED. MANAGEMENT VIEWS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO BE THOSE WHICH ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AND WHERE CHANGES IN THOSE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT HAS IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING AS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.  THE CORPORATION CONSIDERS THAT THE DETERMINATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INVOLVES A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND COMPLEXITY THAN ITS OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. THE BALANCE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS DETERMINED BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO IN RELATION TO PAST LOSS EXPERIENCE, THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE PORTFOLIO, CURRENT ECONOMIC EVENTS AND CONDITIONS AND OTHER PERTINENT FACTORS, INCLUDING MANAGEMENT\u2019S ASSUMPTIONS AS TO FUTURE DELINQUENCIES, RECOVERIES AND LOSSES. ALL OF THESE FACTORS MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. AMONG THE MANY FACTORS AFFECTING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, SOME ARE QUANTITATIVE WHILE OTHERS REQUIRE QUALITATIVE JUDGMENT. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ITS PROCESS FOR DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE ADEQUATELY CONSIDERS ALL OF THE POTENTIAL FACTORS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN CREDIT LOSSES, THE PROCESS INCLUDES SUBJECTIVE ELEMENTS AND MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT ACTUAL OUTCOMES DIFFER FROM MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATES, ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR LOAN LOSSES MAY BE REQUIRED THAT WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE CORPORATION\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR EARNINGS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT.  MANAGEMENT EVALUATES DEBT SECURITIES FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, AND MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN ECONOMIC, MARKET OR OTHER CONCERNS WARRANT SUCH EVALUATION. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO (1) THE LENGTH OF TIME AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST, (2) THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, (3) WHETHER THE MARKET DECLINE WAS AFFECTED BY MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND (4) WHETHER THE CORPORATION HAS THE INTENT TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY OR MORE LIKELY THAN NOT WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY BEFORE ITS ANTICIPATED RECOVERY.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS COST OVER FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION AND DETERMINED TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE ARE NOT AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH ESTIMABLE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR RESPECTIVE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES. GOODWILL IS SUBJECT TO ONGOING PERIODIC IMPAIRMENT TESTS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IMPAIRMENT EXISTS WHEN A REPORTING UNIT\u2019S CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE. AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE REQUIRED ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL WAS PERFORMED AND NO IMPAIRMENT EXISTED AS OF THE VALUATION DATE. IF FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD IT IS DETERMINED THAT THERE HAS BEEN IMPAIRMENT IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL BALANCES, THE CORPORATION WILL RECORD A CHARGE TO EARNINGS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON NET INCOME, BUT NOT RISK BASED CAPITAL RATIOS.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "EMCLAIRE FINANCIAL CORP", "CIK": 858800, "Date": "2019-08-12T00:00:00", "Ticker": "EMCF", "Name": "Emclaire Financial Corp", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 6021.0, "Business": "PA", "Incorporated": "PA", "IRS": 251606091.0, "key": "20190812EMCF", "labelr1": 0.4951937081270076, "labelr2": -2.5507246376811668, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": -0.3569303985722708, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.6406074, "prof1": 0.35939258, "return1&2": 1.020428999016367, "return1&2&3": 1.020428999016367, "return1&2&3&4": 1.024071220309703, "return2": 1.0255072463768116, "return1": 0.99504806291873, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0035693039857227, "1_day_return": 0.4951937081270064, "cumulative_return1": 0.4238722394566369, "cumulative_return1&2": 1.5286138791554709, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 38.92169522452221, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1652.3438273067527, "indexx": 2177, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0315278285320604, "cumreturn1b": 0.9937713147047352, "cumreturndow": 0.9907772347757092, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9885827419161812}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2189, "level_0": 2245, "index": 48550, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION MAY CONTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANY, ITS BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES POSED BY MANY FACTORS AND EVENTS THAT COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY\u2019S ACTUAL BUSINESS, PROSPECTS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE THAT MAY BE ANTICIPATED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES MAY BE SUMMARIZED IN OTHER DOCUMENTS THAT THE COMPANY MAY FILE WITH THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION, SUCH AS OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REFLECT OUR VIEW ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT. THE COMPANY CANNOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS, LEVELS OF ACTIVITY, PERFORMANCE, OR ACHIEVEMENT. THE COMPANY DOES NOT UNDERTAKE ANY OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR CORRECT ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  THE COMPANY HAS LIMITED OPERATIONS AND IS ACTIVELY SEEKING A MERGER, REVERSE MERGER, ACQUISITION OR BUSINESS COMBINATION OPPORTUNITIES WITH AN OPERATING BUSINESS OR OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTION OPPORTUNITIES. UNTIL A TRANSACTION IS EFFECTUATED, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, DURING THIS PERIOD THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT TO ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT INCOME TO OFFSET THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING EXPENSES, RESULTING IN OPERATING LOSSES THAT MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO USE AND THEREBY REDUCE THE COMPANY\u2019S LIMITED CASH BALANCE. THE COMPANY\u2019S PREPAID EXPENSES DURING THE THREE-MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 INCREASED BY $9,000. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE PAYMENT OF THE OTCBB ANNUAL LISTING FEE IN THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. UNTIL THE COMPANY COMPLETES A MERGER, REVERSE MERGER OR OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTION, AND UNLESS INTEREST RATES INCREASE DRAMATICALLY, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO INCUR LOSSES BETWEEN $10,000 TO $12,000 PER QUARTER. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING IN THE FUTURE.  THE PAYMENT OF ANY CASH DISTRIBUTIONS IS SUBJECT TO THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY HAS NO PLANS TO PAY ANY ADDITIONAL CASH DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  CURRENT BUSINESS  SINCE JUNE 2003, THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS CONSIST OF A SEARCH FOR A MERGER, ACQUISITION, REVERSE MERGER OR A BUSINESS TRANSACTION OPPORTUNITY WITH AN OPERATING BUSINESS OR OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTION; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS PLAN WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED. UNTIL A TRANSACTION IS EFFECTUATED, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY HAS NO ARRANGEMENTS OR UNDERSTANDINGS WITH RESPECT TO ANY POTENTIAL MERGER, ACQUISITION, REVERSE MERGER OR BUSINESS COMBINATION CANDIDATE PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY MAY BECOME AN OPERATING COMPANY.  OPPORTUNITIES MAY COME TO THE COMPANY\u2019S ATTENTION FROM VARIOUS SOURCES, INCLUDING OUR MANAGEMENT, OUR STOCKHOLDERS, PROFESSIONAL ADVISORS, SECURITIES BROKER DEALERS, VENTURE CAPITALISTS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, MEMBERS OF THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY AND OTHERS WHO MAY PRESENT UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY HAS NO PLANS, UNDERSTANDINGS, AGREEMENTS, OR COMMITMENTS WITH ANY INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY TO ACT AS A FINDER IN REGARD TO ANY BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. WHILE IT IS NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED THAT THE COMPANY WILL ENGAGE UNAFFILIATED PROFESSIONAL FIRMS SPECIALIZING IN BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, REORGANIZATIONS OR OTHER SUCH TRANSACTIONS, SUCH FIRMS MAY BE RETAINED IF SUCH ARRANGEMENTS ARE DEEMED TO BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMPANY. COMPENSATION TO A FINDER OR BUSINESS ACQUISITION FIRM MAY TAKE VARIOUS FORMS, INCLUDING ONE-TIME CASH PAYMENTS, PAYMENTS INVOLVING ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES (INCLUDING THOSE OF THE COMPANY), OR ANY COMBINATION OF THESE OR OTHER COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY UNABLE TO PREDICT THE COST OF UTILIZING SUCH SERVICES.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT RESTRICTED ITS SEARCH TO ANY PARTICULAR BUSINESS, INDUSTRY, OR GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION. IN EVALUATING A POTENTIAL TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY ANALYZES ALL AVAILABLE FACTORS AND MAKE A DETERMINATION BASED ON A COMPOSITE OF AVAILABLE FACTS, WITHOUT RELIANCE ON ANY SINGLE FACTOR.  9  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO PREDICT THE NATURE OF A TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE COMPANY MAY PARTICIPATE. SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WOULD BE REVIEWED AS WELL AS THE RESPECTIVE NEEDS AND DESIRES OF THE COMPANY AND THE LEGAL STRUCTURE OR METHOD DEEMED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE SUITABLE WOULD BE SELECTED. IN IMPLEMENTING A STRUCTURE FOR A PARTICULAR TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY MAY BECOME A PARTY TO A MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, REORGANIZATION, TENDER OFFER, JOINT VENTURE, LICENSE, PURCHASE AND SALE OF ASSETS, OR PURCHASE AND SALE OF STOCK, OR OTHER ARRANGEMENT THE EXACT NATURE OF WHICH CANNOT NOW BE PREDICTED. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY MAY ACT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH AN INTEREST IN A PARTNERSHIP, CORPORATION OR OTHER FORM OF ORGANIZATION. IMPLEMENTING SUCH STRUCTURE MAY REQUIRE THE MERGER, CONSOLIDATION OR REORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY WITH OTHER BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WOULD BE THE SURVIVING ENTITY. IN ADDITION, OUR PRESENT MANAGEMENT AND STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT HAVE CONTROL OF A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING SHARES OF THE COMPANY FOLLOWING REORGANIZATION OR OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. AS PART OF SUCH A TRANSACTION, SOME OR ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EXISTING DIRECTORS MAY RESIGN AND NEW DIRECTORS MAY BE APPOINTED. THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS FOLLOWING THE CONSUMMATION OF A TRANSACTION WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THE NATURE OF THE TRANSACTION. THERE MAY ALSO BE VARIOUS RISKS INHERENT IN THE TRANSACTION, THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED.  THE COMPANY MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO INCREASED GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION FOLLOWING A TRANSACTION; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO PREDICT THE NATURE OR MAGNITUDE OF SUCH INCREASED REGULATION, IF ANY.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO INCUR MODERATE LOSSES EACH QUARTER UNTIL A TRANSACTION CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE BY MANAGEMENT IS EFFECTUATED.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD A LOSS FROM OPERATIONS OF $16,000. THE LOSS IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OPERATIONAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, AUDITING, TAX RETURN PREPARATION AND LEGAL EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE QUARTER. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, THE LOSS FROM OPERATIONS WAS $16,000. TAXES PAID IN THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018 WERE $0 IN BOTH QUARTERS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WAS $99,000 AS COMPARED TO $115,000 AT MARCH 31, 2019. THE DECREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NET LOSS INCURRED DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $26,000 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $39,000 IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE $13,000 DECREASE IN CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN EXPENSES RELATED TO LEGAL AND OTHER OUTSIDE PROFESSIONALS.  CASH ON HAND AT JUNE 30, 2019 WAS $94,000 AS COMPARED TO $120,000 AT MARCH 31, 2019. THE DECREASE IN CASH ON HAND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ONGOING EXPENSES RELATED TO LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER OUTSIDE PROFESSIONALS.  THE COMPANY HAS NO MATERIAL OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS. THERE HAS BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGE IN ANY CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION AS SUMMARIZED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  10  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "FCCC INC", "CIK": 730669, "Date": "2019-08-13T00:00:00", "Ticker": "FCIC", "Name": "FCCC Inc", "Exchange": "OTC", "SIC": 6770.0, "Business": "CT", "Incorporated": "CT", "IRS": 60759497.0, "key": "20190813FCIC", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.60297596, "prof1": 0.39702395, "return1&2": 1.0, "return1&2&3": 1.0, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.3327327651357517, "cumulative_return1&2": 1.537266494305391, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 31.372081723517038, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1076.6594605172513, "indexx": 2189, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9799470255636489, "cumreturn1b": 0.9738432439353821, "cumreturndow": 0.9617546422813407, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9584703547083363}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2245, "level_0": 2303, "index": 74808, "text": "ITEM 2.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  ENERTECK CORPORATION (THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d OR \u201cENERTECK PARENT\u201d), FORMERLY NAMED GOLD BOND MINING COMPANY AND THEN GOLD BOND RESOURCES, INC., WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON ON JULY 30, 1935. WE ACQUIRED ENERTECK CHEMICAL CORP. (\u201cENERTECK SUB\u201d) AS A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY ON JANUARY 9, 2003. AS A RESULT OF THIS ACQUISITION, WE ARE NOW ACTING AS A HOLDING COMPANY, WITH ENERTECK SUB AS OUR PRIMARY OPERATING BUSINESS. SUBSEQUENT TO THIS TRANSACTION, ON NOVEMBER 24, 2003 WE CHANGED OUR DOMICILE FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON TO THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND CHANGED OUR NAME FROM GOLD BOND RESOURCES, INC. TO ENERTECK CORPORATION. UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES, THE TERMS \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cUS\u201d OR \u201cOUR\u201d REFER TO ENERTECK CORPORATION AND ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY.  ENERTECK SUB, OUR WHOLLY OWNED OPERATING SUBSIDIARY, WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF TEXAS ON NOVEMBER 29, 2000. IT WAS FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMMERCIALIZING A DIESEL FUEL SPECIFIC COMBUSTION CATALYST KNOWN AS ENERBURN (TM), AS WELL AS OTHER COMBUSTION ENHANCEMENT AND EMISSION REDUCTION TECHNOLOGIES. NALCO/EXXON ENERGY CHEMICALS, L.P. (\u201cNALCO/EXXON L.P.\u201d), A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN NALCO CHEMICAL CORPORATION AND EXXON CORPORATION COMMERCIALLY INTRODUCED ENERBURN IN 1998. WHEN NALCO/EXXON L.P. WENT THROUGH AN OWNERSHIP CHANGE IN 2000, OUR FOUNDER, DWAINE REESE, FORMED ENERTECK SUB. IT ACQUIRED THE ENERBURN TRADEMARK AND RELATED ASSETS AND TOOK OVER THE NALCO/EXXON L.P. RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ENERBURN BLENDER AT THAT TIME.  WE UTILIZE A SALES PROCESS THAT INCLUDES DETAILED PROPRIETARY CUSTOMER FLEET MONITORING PROTOCOLS IN ON-ROAD APPLICATIONS THAT QUANTIFY DATA AND ASSISTS IN MANAGING CERTAIN INTERNAL COMBUSTION DIESEL ENGINE OPERATING RESULTS WHILE UTILIZING ENERBURN. TEST DATA PREPARED BY SOUTHWEST RESEARCH INSTITUTE AND ACTUAL CUSTOMER USAGE HAS INDICATED THAT THE USE OF ENERBURN IN DIESEL ENGINES IMPROVES FUEL ECONOMY, LOWERS SMOKE, AND DECREASES ENGINE WEAR AND THE DANGEROUS EMISSIONS OF BOTH NITROGEN OXIDE (NOX) AND MICROSCOPIC AIRBORNE SOLID MATTER (PARTICULATES). OUR PRINCIPAL TARGET MARKETS HAVE INCLUDED THE TRUCKING, HEAVY CONSTRUCTION, MARITIME SHIPPING, RAILROAD AND MINING INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS FEDERAL, STATE AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS. EACH OF THESE INDUSTRIES SHARES CERTAIN COMMON FINANCIAL CHARACTERISTICS, I.E. (I) DIESEL FUEL REPRESENTS A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF OPERATING COSTS; AND (II) RELATIVELY SMALL OPERATING MARGINS ARE PREVALENT. CONSIDERING THESE FACTORS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE USE OF ENERBURN AND THE CORRESPONDING DERIVED SAVINGS IN DIESEL FUEL COSTS CAN POSITIVELY AFFECT THE OPERATING MARGINS OF ITS CUSTOMERS WHILE CONTRIBUTING TO A CLEANER ENVIRONMENT.  DURING 2011, WE ACQUIRED A 40% MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN A ENTITY CALLED ENERTECK ENVIRONMENTAL, LLC, WHICH WAS FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKETING AND SELLING A DIESEL FUEL EMISSION REDUCTION TECHNOLOGY WITH THE CREATORS OF SUCH SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY.  14  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  REVENUES  WE RECOGNIZED REVENUES OF $9,037 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO REVENUES OF $10,427 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, A DECREASE OF $1,390. AS TESTING IS EITHER UNDERWAY OR COMPLETED WITH SEVERAL POTENTIAL NEW CUSTOMERS AND IN NEW AREAS WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE REMAINDER OF 2019 SHOULD SHOW IMPROVEMENT.  GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT, DEFINED AS REVENUES LESS COST OF GOODS SOLD, WAS $7,300, OR 80.8% OF REVENUE, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $8,461, OR 81.1% OF REVENUE, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THERE WILL BE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN GROSS PROFITS AS THE YEAR PROCEEDS, AS SEVERAL RECENTLY COMPLETED SUCCESSFUL TESTS HAVE REACHED THE NEGOTIATION STAGE AND OUR MANUFACTURING PROFICIENCY CONTINUES TO IMPROVE FOR OUR CORE PRODUCTS.  COST OF GOODS SOLD WAS $1,737 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WHICH REPRESENTED 19.2% OF REVENUE COMPARED TO $1,966 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, WHICH REPRESENTED 18.9% OR REVENUE.  COSTS AND EXPENSES  OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $290,669 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $214,861 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, AN INCREASE OF $75,808. COSTS AND EXPENSES IN ALL PERIODS PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF PAYROLL, PROFESSIONAL FEES, RENT EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION EXPENSE, AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND OTHER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PROFESSIONAL FEES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT.  NET LOSS  WE REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $340,757 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $274,778 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, AN INCREASE OF $65,979. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT SALES WILL INCREASE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF CERTAIN COMPLETED TESTING AND NEGOTIATIONS FOR AND WITH NEW CUSTOMERS.  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  REVENUES  WE RECOGNIZED REVENUES OF $25,710 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO REVENUES OF $22,346 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, AN INCREASE OF $3,364. AS TESTING IS EITHER UNDERWAY OR COMPLETED WITH SEVERAL POTENTIAL NEW CUSTOMERS AND IN NEW AREAS WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE REMAINDER OF 2019 SHOULD SHOW IMPROVEMENT.  GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT, DEFINED AS REVENUES LESS COST OF GOODS SOLD, WAS $20,763, OR 80.8% OF REVENUE, FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $17,587, OR 78.7% OF REVENUE, FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THERE WILL BE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN GROSS PROFITS AS THE YEAR PROCEEDS, AS SEVERAL RECENTLY COMPLETED SUCCESSFUL TESTS HAVE REACHED THE NEGOTIATION STAGE AND OUR MANUFACTURING PROFICIENCY CONTINUES TO IMPROVE FOR OUR CORE PRODUCTS.  COST OF GOODS SOLD WAS $4,947 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WHICH REPRESENTED 19.2% OF REVENUE COMPARED TO $4,759 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, WHICH REPRESENTED 21.3% OR REVENUE.  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COSTS AND EXPENSES  OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $569,685 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $418,916 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, AN INCREASE OF $150,769. COSTS AND EXPENSES IN ALL PERIODS PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF PAYROLL, PROFESSIONAL FEES, RENT EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION EXPENSE, AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND OTHER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PROFESSIONAL FEES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT.  NET LOSS  WE REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $661,417 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $512,282 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, AN INCREASE OF $149,135. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT SALES WILL INCREASE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF CERTAIN COMPLETED TESTING AND NEGOTIATIONS FOR AND WITH NEW CUSTOMERS.  OPERATIONS OUTLOOK  THE FUEL ADDITIVE INDUSTRY HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN MIRED BY A MYRIAD OF TECHNICALLY DUBIOUS PRODUCTS. PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS IN ALL TARGETED MARKET SECTORS AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS ARE PRIMARILY CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL BUSINESS RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADOPTION OF ANY NEW FUEL OR ENGINE TREATMENT. OUR SALES PROCESS BEGINS WITH A PROOF OF PERFORMANCE DEMONSTRATION THAT IS A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL CUSTOMER, INCLUDING FLEET TYPE, SIZE, AND OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS FOLLOWED WITH SALES PRESENTATIONS AT BOTH THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL AND MAINTENANCE LEVEL.  THE MAJORITY OF OUR MARKETING EFFORT SINCE 2005 HAS BEEN DIRECTED AT TARGETING AND GAINING A FOOTHOLD IN ONE OF SEVERAL MAJOR TARGET AREAS, INCLUDING THE INLAND MARINE DIESEL MARKET, TRUCKING, HEAVY CONSTRUCTION AND MINING. MANAGEMENT CONCEDES THAT SALES REVENUES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, THE CALENDAR YEAR 2018 AND PRIOR YEARS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN ANTICIPATED. ONE OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE FACED IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN THE VERY LONG TIMELINE FROM INITIAL CONTACT TO CONTRACT SIGNING SUBSEQUENT TO COMPLETION OF AN EVALUATION. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT MANY TIMES IN THE PAST, WE HAVE PROVEN THE BENEFITS OF ENERBURN, VARIOUS EVALUATING COMPANIES HAVE OPTED NOT TO MOVE FORWARD FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WHICH WE BELIEVE WERE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  NEVERTHELESS, AT BOTH THE COMPANY AND DISTRIBUTOR LEVEL, WE HAVE RECENTLY COMPLETED OR ARE PROCEEDING WITH EVALUATIONS OF ENERBURN IN MANY FIELD TRIALS. AS WE CONTINUE TO STRING TOGETHER A SERIES OF POSITIVE EVALUATIONS IN MORE INDUSTRIES, WE SHOULD BEGIN TO SEE MORE BUSINESS GENERATED FROM SUCH RESULTS. NEW TRIALS ARE EITHER IN PROGRESS OR SHOULD BE COMMENCING SHORTLY.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  ON JUNE 30, 2019 WE HAD A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF $8,114,056 AND A STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 DEFICIT OF $7,926,333 COMPARED TO A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF $7,460,127 AND A STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 DEFICIT OF $7,264,916 ON DECEMBER 31, 2018. OUR CONTINUING DEFICIT LEVELS ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO POOR SALES. ON JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD $15,239 IN CASH, TOTAL ASSETS OF $318,469 AND TOTAL LIABILITIES OF $8,244,802, COMPARED TO $11,851 IN CASH, TOTAL ASSETS OF $318,444 AND TOTAL LIABILITIES OF $7,583,360 ON DECEMBER 31, 2018.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $314,932 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $394,102 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, A DECREASE OF $79,170. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $0 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018.  IN THE PAST, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS PRIMARILY FROM CAPITAL WHICH HAS BEEN RAISED. TO DATE, SALES HAVE NOT BEEN ADEQUATE TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS WITHOUT INVESTMENT CAPITAL. CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $318,320 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WITH $43,425 PROVIDED BY THE FINANCING OF PREPAID INSURANCE, REPAYMENTS ON THE FINANCING OF PREPAID INSURANCE OF $25,105 AND $300,000 FROM RELATED PARTY NOTES AND ADVANCES AS COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $406,100 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 WHICH WAS COMPRISED $355,000 OF RELATED PARTY NOTES AND ADVANCES AND $51,100 IN FINANCING OF PREPAID INSURANCE.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ANTICIPATE, BASED ON CURRENTLY PROPOSED PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS, THAT IN ADDITION TO OUR CURRENT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS TOGETHER WITH PROJECTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND PROJECTED REVENUES, WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT TO SATISFY OUR CONTEMPLATED CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE MADE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH INVESTMENT ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US OR AT ALL. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR COSTS AND EXPENSES OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $3.0 MILLION. OUR CONTINUATION AS A GOING CONCERN IS CONTINGENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING AND TO GENERATE REVENUES AND CASH FLOW TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS ON A TIMELY BASIS. AS MENTIONED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SALES REVENUES HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN EARLIER ANTICIPATED. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HAVE BEEN CORRECTED OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING CORRECTED AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT REOCCUR IN THE FUTURE AND THE GENERAL STATE OF THE ECONOMY. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THAT SALES SHOULD SHOW INCREASES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 AND INTO 2020. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE MADE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN REQUIRED FINANCIAL BACKING ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US OR AT ALL. OUR CONTEMPLATED CASH REQUIREMENTS BEYOND 2019 WILL DEPEND PRIMARILY UPON LEVEL OF SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS, INVENTORY LEVELS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING EXPENDITURES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  DUE TO OUR LACK OF MEANINGFUL REVENUES, WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS PRIMARILY FROM CAPITAL WHICH HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THIRD PARTIES AND PROMISSORY NOTES AND ADVANCES FROM RELATED PARTIES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, SUCH LOANS AND ADVANCES FROM RELATED PARTIES TOTAL $2,162,500 AS COMPARED TO $1,862,500 ON DECEMBER 31, 2018. MANY OF THESE REMAINING LOANS ARE PAST DUE AND CERTAIN OTHERS ARE DUE ON DEMAND. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT ANY OF SUCH RELATED PARTIES TO DEMAND PAYMENT UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO PAY BACK SUCH LOANS AND ADVANCES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH WILL BE THE CASE. THIS DEBT PRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE COMPANY IN THAT IN THE EVENT ANY OF SUCH RELATED PARTIES DEMAND PAYMENT, THE COMPANY MAY NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY CASH TO MEET SUCH PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, OR IF IT DOES, SUCH PAYMENTS MAY DRAW SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH POSITION. ANY OF SUCH EVENTS WILL LIKELY HAVE A MATERIALLY DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.  INFLATION HAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "ENERTECK CORP", "CIK": 1128353, "Date": "2019-08-14T00:00:00", "Ticker": "ETCK", "Name": "Enerteck Corp", "Exchange": "OTC", "SIC": 2890.0, "Business": "TX", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 910757753.0, "key": "20190814ETCK", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.635496, "prof1": 0.36450395, "return1&2": 1.0, "return1&2&3": 1.0, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.402428908631202, "cumulative_return1&2": 3.9320715841105343, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 24.76867195461789, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 645.8488321544049, "indexx": 2245, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9901159818436455, "cumreturn1b": 0.9642177596308816, "cumreturndow": 0.9641246634964737, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9622309958633618}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2307, "level_0": 2366, "index": 24417, "text": "ITEM 2.

OVERVIEW  WE WERE INCORPORATED ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2010,  IN NEVADA. OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS THE ACQUISITION AND EXPLORATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES. WE HAVE NOT PRESENTLY DETERMINED WHETHER  THE PROPERTIES TO WHICH WE HAVE MINERAL RIGHTS CONTAIN MINERAL RESERVES THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY RECOVERABLE.  WE HAVE ONLY HAD LIMITED OPERATIONS TO  DATE AND WE RELY UPON THE SALE OF OUR SECURITIES AND BORROWINGS FROM OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT INVESTORS TO FUND  OUR OPERATIONS, AS WE HAVE NOT GENERATED ANY REVENUE.  IN AUGUST 2012, WE ENTERED INTO AN OPTION  AGREEMENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY PURCHASED THE \u201cSILVER DISTRICT\u201d PROJECT CONSISTING OF 85 UNPATENTED LODE MINING CLAIMS,  4 PATENTED LODE CLAIMS, A ARIZONA STATE EXPLORATION PERMIT OF 154.66 ACRES AND 23 UNPATENTED MILL SITE CLAIMS, TOTALING OVER 2,000  ACRES IN LA PAZ COUNTY, ARIZONA. SINCE OUR ACQUISITION, WE HAVE INCREASED OUR LAND POSITION IN THE SILVER DISTRICT BY STAKING TWO  UNPATENTED LODE MINING CLAIMS, LEASED TWO ADDITIONAL PATENTED CLAIMS AND HAVE INCREASED OUR ARIZONA STATE EXPLORATION PERMIT TO  334.85 ACRES.  ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2014, WE FORMED AND ORGANIZED  A NEW WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, GULF + WESTERN INDUSTRIES, INC., A NEVADA CORPORATION (\u201cGULF+WESTERN\u201d OR \u201cG+W\u201d),  TO OWN OUR SILVER DISTRICT MINING INTERESTS. ON OCTOBER 1, 2014 WE COMPLETED THE TRANSFER OF THOSE ASSETS FROM MAGELLAN TO G+W.  AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSFER, MAGELLAN OWNED ALL THE OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK OF G+W. EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2014, MAGELLAN PLEDGED  ALL ITS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN G+W TO MR. JOHN D. GIBBS, A SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER IN THE COMPANY, AS SECURITY FOR OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS  UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT BETWEEN MAGELLAN AND MR. GIBBS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OWED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT  WAS $1,160,955, WHICH INCLUDES $869,550 OF PRINCIPAL AND $291,405 OF ACCRUED INTEREST.  ON OCTOBER 24, 2016, THE COMPANY ENTERED  INTO A MINING OPTION AGREEMENT (\u201cAGREEMENT\u201d) BETWEEN AND AMONG RIO SILVER INC., A CANADIAN COMPANY (\u201cRIO SILVER\u201d),  MINERA RIO PLATA S.A.C., A PERUVIAN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY OF RIO SILVER (\u201cMINERA\u201d), AND MAGELLAN GOLD PERU S.A.C.,  A PERUVIAN COMPANY AND WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY (\u201cMAGELLAN PERU\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH RIO SILVER THROUGH  MINERA, GRANTED TO THE COMPANY THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE OPTION TO ACQUIRE AN UNDIVIDED 50% INTEREST IN AND TO PROPERTY LOCATED IN  CENTRAL PERU. EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE COMPANY AGREED WITH RIO SILVER TO TERMINATE THE OPTION AGREEMENT, THEREBY TERMINATING  THE COMPANY\u2019S OPTION TO EARN AN INTEREST IN THE NIN\u0303OBAMBA SILVER/GOLD PROJECT. THE COMPANY RETAINED ITS OWNERSHIP  OF RIO SILVER STOCK, WHICH HAVE BEEN PLEDGED TO SECURE A $125,000 LOAN FROM JOHN POWER.  20  ON NOVEMBER 30, 2017, THE COMPANY PURCHASED  FROM ROSE PETROLEUM PLC (\u201cROSE\u201d) A MINERAL PROCESSING MILL OPERATION LOCATED IN THE STATE OF NAVARIT, MEXICO (THE \u201cSDA  MILL\u201d) AS WELL AS ITS ASSOCIATED ASSETS, LICENSES AND AGREEMENTS. MAGELLAN PAID A $50,000 OPTION PAYMENT, AND AN ADDITIONAL  $100,000 OPTION-TO-PURCHASE EXTENSION. THE $100,000 OPTION EXTENSION PAYMENT WAS APPLIED AGAINST THE CASH PORTION OF THE PURCHASE  PRICE.  THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE SDA MILL CONSISTED  OF $850,000 CASH, A $50,000 PROMISSORY NOTE, THE $50,000 NON-REFUNDABLE OPTION PAYMENT, THE $100,000 FOR THE OPTION-TO-PURCHASE  PAYMENT, AND 284,017 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (THE \u201cSHARES\u201d) WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $426,025 AT THE CLOSING DATE. THE  NOTE IS NON-INTEREST BEARING AND WAS DUE ON MARCH 10, 2018 AND PAID IN APRIL 2018. THE SHARES WERE HELD IN ESCROW FOR A PERIOD  OF 12 MONTHS AND THE COMPANY HAD THE OPTION TO REPURCHASE THE SHARES FROM ROSE FOR THE SUM OF $500,000 IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS  AND $550,000 IN MONTHS 7 TO 12.  PRIOR TO CLOSING, ALL OF THE ASSETS AND  OPERATIONS RELATED TO THE SDA MILL WERE TRANSFERRED TO A NEWLY INCORPORATED ENTITY, MINERALES VANE 2 S.A. DE C.V. (\u201cMINERALES  VANE 2\u201d). EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 30, 2017, THE COMPANY\u2019S NEWLY INCORPORATED WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, MAGELLAN ACQUISITION  CORPORATION (\u201cMAC\u201d), ACQUIRED 100% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF MINERALES VANE 2.  ON OCTOBER 17, 2017, THE COMPANY AMENDED  THE AGREEMENT TO INCLUDE THE ACQUISITION OF MINERALES VANE OPERACIONES (\"MVO\") (THE ENTITY THAT PROVIDES LABOR TO THE  MILL) FOR $2,500. IN JANUARY 2018 THE COMPANY PAID THE PURCHASE PRICE AND OBTAINED LEGAL CONTROL OF MVO. MVO IS THE SISTER ENTITY  WHICH WAS ORGANIZED FOR THE PURPOSE OF EMPLOYING ALL PERSONNEL OF THE SDA MILL. THE ACQUISITION OF MVO WILL NOT RESULT IN THE ACQUISITION  OF ANY ADDITIONAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT  GIVING IT THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE THE EL DORADO GOLD-SILVER PROPERTY, A 50 HECTARE MINING CONCESSION LOCATED NEAR THE VILLAGE OF  LAS MINITAS, WHICH LIES 50 KILOMETERS SOUTH OF MAGELLAN\u2019S SDA FLOTATION PLANT AT ACAPONETA, NAYARIT STATE. MAGELLAN INTENDS  TO ADVANCE EL DORADO TOWARDS PRODUCTION AS A MATTER OF PRIORITY. THE PROJECT HAS EXCELLENT ROAD AND RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE  COMPANY PLANS TO TRUCK THE ORE FROM EL DORADO TO THE SDA PLANT FOR PROCESSING. EL DORADO IS SITUATED WITHIN A DISTRICT OF EPITHERMAL  VEIN SYSTEMS FROM WHICH HISTORIC MINING PRODUCED HIGH GRADES.  COMMENCEMENT OF MINING WILL DEPEND ON A  NUMBER OF PRECONDITIONS, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH INCLUDE OBTAINING ENVIRONMENTAL AND BLASTING PERMITS, SELECTING AND MOBILIZING  A MINING CONTRACTOR AND PROCURING FINANCING. AN ACCESS AND LAND USE AGREEMENT WITH THE LOCAL EJIDO ALREADY IS IN PLACE. ONCE DEVELOPMENT  BEGINS, ORE WILL BE ACCESSIBLE WITH A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF UNDERGROUND DEVELOPMENT. ORE WILL BE SOURCED INITIALLY FROM THE SHALLOW,  UPPER PORTIONS OF THE MINERALIZED VEINS.  DRILLING ON THE EL DORADO VEIN SYSTEM WAS  CONDUCTED BY A TSX.V-LISTED COMPANY IN 2010-2011 AND COMPRISED 28 DIAMOND CORE HOLES TOTALING 4,950 METERS. TWO VEINS APPEAR TO  OFFER PARTICULAR PROMISE FOR MINING, NAMELY THE HUNDIDO AND INTERMEDIA VEINS. THESE VEINS LIE ADJACENT TO AND ALONG STRIKE FROM  THE OLD HUNDIDO MINE, WHICH FROM 1900-1927 PRODUCED AN ESTIMATED 50,000 TONNES OF HIGH-GRADE GOLD-SILVER ORE. THE VEINS ARE STEEPLY-DIPPING,  HIGHLY SILICIFIED STRUCTURES CUTTING VOLCANIC ROCKS. POLYGONAL RESOURCE CALCULATIONS FOR THE TWO VEINS, BASED ON INTERSECTIONS  IN 10 CORE HOLES AND AFTER APPLYING A 25% TONNAGE DEDUCTION FOR DILUTION AND RECOVERY FACTORS, YIELDED RESPECTIVELY 89,000 TONNES  GRADING 7.01 G/T GOLD EQUIVALENT (AU+AG) OVER A TRUE WIDTH OF 2.3 METERS (HUNDIDO VEIN); AND 91,000 TONNES GRADING 15.17 G/T GOLD  EQUIVALENT (AU+AG) OVER A TRUE WIDTH OF 8.3 METERS (INTERMEDIA VEIN). THESE RESOURCES ARE NON-NI43-101 COMPLIANT. THE MINERALIZATION  EXTENDS FROM NEAR SURFACE TO A DRILLED DEPTH OF 150 METERS AND IS OPEN AT GREATER DEPTH.  THE EL DORADO VEIN SYSTEM CAN BE TRACED  ON THE SURFACE FOR A DISTANCE GREATER THAN THREE KILOMETERS AND EXHIBITS STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY WITH NUMEROUS CONJUGATE VEIN SPLITS  BOTH IN THE HANGINGWALL AND FOOTWALL. THIS COMPLEX STRUCTURE HOSTS MULTIPLE MINERALIZED ZONES INCLUDING HIGH-GRADE VEINS POTENTIALLY  MINABLE UNDERGROUND, AND LOWER-GRADE OPEN-PITTABLE STOCKWORK ZONES THAT ARE OBSERVED TO EXTEND OVER TENS OF METERS IN WIDTH IN  BOTH THE HANGINGWALL AND FOOTWALL OF THE EL DORADO VEIN SYSTEM.  21  MAGELLAN HAS CONCLUDED AN AGREEMENT WITH  INGENIEROS MINEROS, S.A. DE C.V., THE OWNER OF THE EL DORADO MINING CONCESSION GIVING THE COMPANY THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE THE CONCESSION  BY MAKING STAGED SIX-MONTHLY OPTION PAYMENTS OVER TWO YEARS TOWARDS AN END PURCHASE PRICE OF $800,000 (PLUS 16% IVA). NO ROYALTIES  ARE PAYABLE. MAGELLAN HAS THE RIGHT TO BEGIN PRODUCTION DURING THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY HAS MADE THE INITIAL OPTION  PAYMENT OF $50,000 (PLUS 16% IVA) PLUS AN ADDITIONAL $50,000 DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. IN ADDITION, MAGELLAN  HAS AGREED WITH A TSX.V-LISTED COMPANY TO PURCHASE A COMPREHENSIVE EL DORADO DATA PACKAGE INCLUDING DIAMOND DRILL CORE AND TECHNICAL  INFORMATION FOR A PRICE OF $120,000, PAYABLE IN CASH AND MAGELLAN COMMON STOCK.  OUR PRIMARY FOCUS WITH THE ACQUISITION  OF THE SDA MILL IN MEXICO IS TO TRANSFORM MAGELLAN INTO A PRODUCTION COMPANY, TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE OUR ARIZONA SILVER PROJECT  TOWARDS RESOURCE DEFINITION AND EVENTUAL DEVELOPMENT, AND POSSIBLY TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL MINERAL RIGHTS AND CONDUCT ADDITIONAL  EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT AND PERMITTING ACTIVITIES. OUR MINERAL LEASE PAYMENTS, PERMITTING APPLICATIONS AND EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT  EFFORTS WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. WE RELY UPON THE SALE OF OUR SECURITIES AS WELL AS ADVANCES AND LOANS FROM EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT  AND SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDERS TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AS WE HAVE NOT GENERATED ANY SIGNIFICANT REVENUE.

THE CURRENT BORROWING LIMIT ON THE CREDIT LINE IS $1,000,000 WITH A BORROWING AVAILABILITY OF $130,450 REMAINING.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY RAISED  $30,000 THROUGH THE SALE OF 30,000 UNITS AT A PRICE OF $1.00 PER UNIT. EACH UNIT CONSISTS OF ONE SHARE OF COMMON STOCK AND FOUR  COMMON STOCK WARRANTS. TWO OF THE WARRANTS EXPIRE ON MAY 8, 2019 AND ARE EXERCISABLE AT $2.00. THE OTHER TWO WARRANTS EXPIRE ON  AUGUST 8, 2019 AND ARE EXERCISABLE AT $3.00. IN APRIL 2019 THE WARRANTS EXPIRING ON MAY 8, 2019 WERE EXTENDED UNTIL MAY 28, 2019  AND THE EXERCISE PRICE WAS REDUCED TO $1.00 PER SHARE. AS OF MAY 31, 2019 THESE WARRANTS WERE EXTENDED TO JULY 31, 2019. ON JULY  31, 2019 ALL OF THE STOCK WARRANTS WERE EXTENDED UNTIL OCTOBER 31, 2019.  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY RECEIVED $265,300  OF PROCEEDS FROM ADVANCES FROM RELATED AND THIRD PARTIES.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL  BE IN THE FORM OF ADDITIONAL LOANS FROM OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDERS, OR EQUITY FINANCING FROM THE SALE OF OUR  COMMON STOCK BUT CANNOT ASSURE THAT ANY FUTURE FINANCINGS WILL OCCUR.  CASH FLOWS  A SUMMARY OF OUR CASH PROVIDED BY AND USED  IN OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES IS AS FOLLOWS.  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019  2018  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(143,585  )  $(306,346  )  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (75,000  )  \u2013  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  217,929  336,192  EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE  (2,359  )  (28,237  )  NET CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  (3,015  )  1,609  CASH  BEGINNING OF PERIOD  4,862  421  CASH END OF PERIOD  $1,847  $2,030  AT JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD $1,847 IN CASH  AND A $4,445,673 WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT. THIS COMPARES TO CASH OF $4,862 AND A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF $3,788,972 AT DECEMBER  31, 2018.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS $143,585 AND WAS MAINLY COMPRISED OF OUR $852,109 NET LOSS DURING THE PERIOD, ADJUSTED BY  A NON-CASH CHARGES OF $189,600 OF STOCK COMPENSATION, DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OF $61,440 AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND INTEREST OF $466,524.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019,  OUR NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $75,000 WHICH WAS DUE TO A $50,000 PAYMENT ON THE EL DORADO GOLD-SILVER PROPERTY  AND A $25,000 PAYMENT ON THE DATA PACKAGE TO SUPPORT THE EL DORADO PROPERTY.  25  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019,  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $217,929 COMPRISED OF THE SALE OF STOCK AND WARRANTS OF $30,000, RELATED AND THIRD  PARTY ADVANCES OF $265,300 AND PAYMENTS ON ADVANCES FROM RELATED PARTIES OF $77,371.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT HAVE AND HAVE NEVER HAD ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES  OF CONSOLIDATION  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE  OUR ACCOUNTS AND THE ACCOUNTS OF OUR 100% OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, GULF + WESTERN INDUSTRIES, INC., MAGELLAN ACQUISITION CORPORATION,  MINERALES VANE 2, S.A. DE C.V., AND MINERALES VANE OPERACIONES, S.A DE C.V.. ALL INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN  ELIMINATED. OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED  IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d).  USE OF ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GAAP REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED  AMOUNTS OF EXPENSES DURING THE PERIOD PRESENTED.  WE MAKE OUR ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME  FOR THESE ITEMS BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS AND OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE WHEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED. CHANGES  IN ESTIMATES ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING RULES FOR THE ESTIMATE, WHICH IS TYPICALLY IN THE PERIOD WHEN NEW  INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS ARE REASONABLE, BASED UPON  INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THEY WERE MADE. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES, MAKING IT POSSIBLE THAT A CHANGE  IN THESE ESTIMATES COULD OCCUR IN THE NEAR TERM.  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS  THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ITS ACCOUNTING RECORDS  IN US DOLLARS. OUR OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, MINERALES VANE 2, S.A. DE C.V., AND MINERALES VANE OPERACIONES, S.A DE C.V., REPORT  IN MEXICAN PESOS WHICH IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR BOTH ENTITIES. THE SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN THEIR  RESPECTIVE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES AND ARE REPORTED TO THE COMPANY IN MEXICAN PESOS. FOR REPORTING, THE COMPANY TRANSLATES THE SUBSIDIARIES\u2019  TRANSACTIONS AND ACCOUNTS TO US DOLLARS AT EXCHANGE RATES APPROXIMATING THOSE RULING AT THE TRANSACTION DATES. EXCHANGE GAINS AND  LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN THE STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES  ARE TRANSLATED INTO THE U.S. DOLLARS AT EXCHANGE RATES AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE, EQUITY ACCOUNTS ARE TRANSLATED AT HISTORICAL  EXCHANGE RATE AND REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED BY USING THE AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED  AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  WE VALUE OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  USING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED  LIABILITIES, AMOUNTS DUE TO RELATED PARTIES AND NOTES PAYABLE TO RELATED PARTIES. FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE  RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT  DATE. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED LIABILITIES, NOTES PAYABLE TO RELATED PARTIES  AND OTHER AMOUNTS DUE TO RELATED PARTIES APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  26  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK  OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHICH POTENTIALLY  SUBJECT US TO CREDIT RISK ARE OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. WE MAINTAIN OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT REPUTABLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  AND CURRENTLY, WE ARE NOT EXPOSED TO SIGNIFICANT CREDIT RISK.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  WE CONSIDER ALL AMOUNTS ON DEPOSIT WITH  FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS AT  THE DATE OF PURCHASE.  MINERAL RIGHTS  WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT OUR MINERAL RIGHTS  MEET THE DEFINITION OF MINERAL RIGHTS, AS DEFINED BY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, AND ARE TANGIBLE ASSETS. AS A RESULT, OUR DIRECT COSTS  TO ACQUIRE OR LEASE MINERAL RIGHTS ARE INITIALLY CAPITALIZED AS TANGIBLE ASSETS. MINERAL RIGHTS INCLUDE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH.  LEASING OR ACQUIRING PATENTED AND UNPATENTED MINING CLAIMS; LEASING MINING RIGHTS INCLUDING LEASE SIGNATURE BONUSES, LEASE RENTAL  PAYMENTS AND ADVANCE MINIMUM ROYALTY PAYMENTS; AND OPTIONS TO PURCHASE OR LEASE MINERAL PROPERTIES.  IF WE ESTABLISH PROVEN AND PROBABLE RESERVES  FOR A MINERAL PROPERTY AND ESTABLISH THAT THE MINERAL PROPERTY CAN BE ECONOMICALLY DEVELOPED, MINERAL RIGHTS WILL BE AMORTIZED  OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE PROPERTY FOLLOWING THE COMMENCEMENT OF COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION OR EXPENSED IF IT IS DETERMINED  THAT THE MINERAL PROPERTY HAS NO FUTURE ECONOMIC VALUE OR IF THE PROPERTY IS SOLD OR ABANDONED. FOR MINERAL RIGHTS IN WHICH PROVEN  AND PROBABLE RESERVES HAVE NOT YET BEEN ESTABLISHED, WE ASSESS THE CARRYING VALUES FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING  PERIOD AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  THE NET CARRYING VALUE OF OUR MINERAL RIGHTS  REPRESENTS THE FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME THE MINERAL RIGHTS WERE ACQUIRED LESS ACCUMULATED DEPLETION AND ANY ABANDONMENT OR IMPAIRMENT  LOSSES. PROVEN AND PROBABLE RESERVES HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR MINERAL RIGHTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2019. AT JUNE 30, 2019, MINERAL  RIGHTS TOTALING $99,405 WERE NET OF $441,057 OF CUMULATIVE IMPAIRMENT AND ABANDONMENT CHARGES. NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE RECOGNIZED  FOR EITHER OF THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 OR 2018.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND MINING RIGHTS  WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR EVENTS AND CHANGES  IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COULD INDICATE THAT OUR CARRYING AMOUNTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING MINERAL RIGHTS, MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  WHEN SUCH EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR, WE ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS BY DETERMINING WHETHER THE  CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS WILL BE RECOVERED THROUGH THEIR UNDISCOUNTED EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOW. IF THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED  CASH FLOW IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE ASSETS, WE RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING  AMOUNT OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS.  NOTES PAYABLE \u2013 RELATED PARTIES  NOTES PAYABLE TO RELATED PARTIES ARE CLASSIFIED  AS CURRENT LIABILITIES AS THE NOTE HOLDERS EITHER HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE REPAYMENT DATES OF THE NOTES OR THE NOTES ARE  DUE WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE.  EXPLORATION COSTS  MINERAL EXPLORATION COSTS ARE EXPENSED  AS INCURRED. WHEN IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT IT IS ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE TO EXTRACT MINERALS AND THE PERMITTING PROCESS HAS BEEN  INITIATED, EXPLORATION COSTS INCURRED TO FURTHER DELINEATE AND DEVELOP THE PROPERTY ARE CONSIDERED PRE-COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION COSTS  AND WILL BE CAPITALIZED AND INCLUDED AS MINE DEVELOPMENT COSTS IN OUR BALANCE SHEETS.  27  INCOME TAXES  WE RECOGNIZE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  FOR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE AMOUNTS AT WHICH THEY ARE CARRIED IN THE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS AND THE EFFECT OF NET OPERATING LOSSES BASED UPON THE ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR THE YEAR IN WHICH THE DIFFERENCES  ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED WHEN NECESSARY TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT EXPECTED  TO BE REALIZED. AT JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD NO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.  NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE  WE COMPUTE BASIC NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE  BY DIVIDING OUR NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY OUR WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING  THE PERIOD. COMPUTATION OF DILUTED NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE ADDS THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING  TO THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING, AS CALCULATED FOR BASIC NET LOSS PER SHARE, EXCEPT FOR INSTANCES IN WHICH THERE  IS A NET LOSS. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES ASSOCIATED WITH CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE  AND OUTSTANDING WARRANTS TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK HAVE BEEN OMITTED FROM THE NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE COMPUTATION AS THEY ARE  ANTI-DILUTIVE DUE TO THE NET LOSS FOR THESE PERIODS.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  THE COMPANY MEASURES THE COST OF EMPLOYEE  SERVICES RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN AWARD OF EQUITY INSTRUMENTS (SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS, OR SBP) BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE  OF THE AWARD. THAT COST IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE PERIOD DURING WHICH AN EMPLOYEE IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SERVICE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE  SBP AWARD\u2014THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD (VESTING PERIOD). FOR SBP AWARDS SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS, COMPENSATION IS NOT RECOGNIZED  UNTIL THE PERFORMANCE CONDITION IS PROBABLE OF OCCURRENCE. THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF SHARE OPTIONS IS ESTIMATED USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON  OPTION-PRICING MODEL. THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2018-07 ON JANUARY 1, 2019 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD, WHICH ALIGNS  THE ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES AND NONEMPLOYEES.  RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO.  2016-02, LEASES (TOPIC 842) (ASU 2016-02). UNDER ASU NO. 2016-2, AN ENTITY IS REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE  LIABILITIES ON ITS BALANCE SHEET AND DISCLOSE KEY INFORMATION ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. ASU NO. 2016-02 OFFERS SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING  GUIDANCE FOR A LESSEE, A LESSOR AND SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS. LESSEES AND LESSORS ARE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE QUALITATIVE AND  QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS TO ENABLE A USER OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO ASSESS THE AMOUNT, TIMING AND  UNCERTAINTY OF CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM LEASES. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS STANDARD ON JANUARY 1, 2019 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE  METHOD. THE NEW STANDARD PROVIDES A NUMBER OF OPTIONAL PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS IN TRANSITION. THE COMPANY ELECTED THE \u2018PACKAGE  OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS\u2019, WHICH PERMITTED THE COMPANY NOT TO REASSESS UNDER THE NEW STANDARD ITS PRIOR CONCLUSIONS ABOUT  LEASE IDENTIFICATION, LEASE CLASSIFICATION AND INITIAL DIRECT COSTS; AND ALL OF THE NEW STANDARD\u2019S AVAILABLE TRANSITION PRACTICAL  EXPEDIENTS.  ON ADOPTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED ADDITIONAL  OPERATING LIABILITIES OF $6,968, WITH CORRESPONDING RIGHT OF USE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AMOUNT BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE  OF THE REMAINING MINIMUM RENTAL PAYMENTS UNDER CURRENT LEASING STANDARDS FOR ITS EXISTING OPERATING LEASES.  THE NEW STANDARD ALSO PROVIDES PRACTICAL  EXPEDIENTS FOR A COMPANY\u2019S ONGOING ACCOUNTING. THE COMPANY ELECTED THE SHORT-TERM LEASE RECOGNITION EXEMPTION FOR ITS LEASES.  FOR THOSE LEASES WITH A LEASE TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS, THE COMPANY WILL NOT RECOGNIZE ROU ASSETS OR LEASE LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY  ALSO MADE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO COMBINE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS OF OPERATING LEASES FOR ALL ASSET CLASSES.  28", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "MAGELLAN GOLD Corp", "CIK": 1515317, "Date": "2019-08-15T00:00:00", "Ticker": "MAGE", "Name": "Magellan Gold Corp", "Exchange": "OTCBB", "SIC": 1000.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "NV", "IRS": 273566922.0, "key": "20190815MAGE", "labelr1": 0.42372881355933184, "labelr2": 0.4219409282700332, "labelr3": 2.9411764705882475, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.61541766, "prof1": 0.38458237, "return1&2": 0.9915611814345991, "return1&2&3": 0.962397617274758, "return1&2&3&4": 0.962397617274758, "return2": 0.9957805907172996, "return1": 0.9957627118644068, "return3": 0.9705882352941176, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 0.4237288135593209, "cumulative_return1": 0.5940853208892786, "cumulative_return1&2": 4.297134488521744, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 32.913549133034266, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 565.4770765499384, "indexx": 2307, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.981688903472761, "cumreturn1b": 0.9465618751610024, "cumreturndow": 0.9780332460813522, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9737652206508297}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2311, "level_0": 2370, "index": 87037, "text": "ITEM 2  \u2013 MANAGEMENT\u2019S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS  QUARTERLY R  EPORT ON FORM 10-Q  .

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT DEVELOPS AND COMMERCIALIZES PRODUCTS MADE FROM AMORPHOUS ALLOYS. OUR LIQUIDMETAL\u00ae FAMILY OF ALLOYS CONSISTS OF A VARIETY OF PROPRIETARY BULK ALLOYS AND COMPOSITES THAT UTILIZE THE ADVANTAGES OFFERED BY AMORPHOUS ALLOY TECHNOLOGY. WE DESIGN, DEVELOP AND SELL CUSTOM PRODUCTS AND PARTS FROM BULK AMORPHOUS ALLOYS TO CUSTOMERS IN VARIOUS INDUSTRIES. WE ALSO PARTNER WITH THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS AND LICENSEES TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE LIQUIDMETAL ALLOY PRODUCTS.  AMORPHOUS ALLOYS ARE, IN GENERAL, UNIQUE MATERIALS THAT ARE DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR ABILITY TO RETAIN A RANDOM ATOMIC STRUCTURE WHEN THEY SOLIDIFY, IN CONTRAST TO THE CRYSTALLINE ATOMIC STRUCTURE THAT FORMS IN OTHER METALS AND ALLOYS WHEN THEY SOLIDIFY. LIQUIDMETAL ALLOYS ARE PROPRIETARY AMORPHOUS ALLOYS THAT POSSESS A COMBINATION OF PERFORMANCE, PROCESSING, AND POTENTIAL COST ADVANTAGES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL MAKE THEM PREFERABLE TO OTHER MATERIALS IN A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS. THE AMORPHOUS ATOMIC STRUCTURE OF BULK ALLOYS ENABLES THEM TO OVERCOME CERTAIN PERFORMANCE LIMITATIONS CAUSED BY INHERENT WEAKNESSES IN CRYSTALLINE ATOMIC STRUCTURES, THUS FACILITATING PERFORMANCE AND PROCESSING CHARACTERISTICS SUPERIOR IN MANY WAYS TO THOSE OF THEIR CRYSTALLINE COUNTERPARTS. WE BELIEVE OUR ALLOYS AND THE MOLDING TECHNOLOGIES WE EMPLOY CAN RESULT IN COMPONENTS FOR MANY APPLICATIONS THAT EXHIBIT EXCEPTIONAL DIMENSIONAL CONTROL AND REPEATABILITY THAT RIVALS PRECISION MACHINING, EXCELLENT CORROSION RESISTANCE, BRILLIANT SURFACE FINISH, HIGH STRENGTH, HIGH HARDNESS, HIGH ELASTIC LIMIT, ALLOYS THAT ARE NON-MAGNETIC, AND THE ABILITY TO FORM COMPLEX SHAPES COMMON TO THE INJECTION MOLDING OF PLASTICS. ALL OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE ACHIEVABLE FROM THE MOLDING PROCESS, SO DESIGN ENGINEERS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE TO SELECT SPECIFIC ALLOYS TO ACHIEVE ONE OR MORE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS AS IS THE CASE WITH CRYSTALLINE MATERIALS. WE BELIEVE THESE ADVANTAGES COULD RESULT IN LIQUIDMETAL ALLOYS SUPPLANTING HIGH-PERFORMANCE ALLOYS, SUCH AS TITANIUM AND STAINLESS STEEL, AND OTHER INCUMBENT MATERIALS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS. MOREOVER, WE BELIEVE THESE ADVANTAGES COULD ENABLE THE INTRODUCTION OF ENTIRELY NEW PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS THAT ARE NOT POSSIBLE OR COMMERCIALLY VIABLE WITH OTHER MATERIALS.  OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM I) SELLING OUR BULK AMORPHOUS ALLOY CUSTOM PRODUCTS AND PARTS FOR APPLICATIONS WHICH INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, NON-CONSUMER ELECTRONIC DEVICES, MEDICAL PRODUCTS, AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS, AND SPORTS AND LEISURE GOODS; II) SELLING TOOLING AND PROTOTYPE PARTS SUCH AS DEMONSTRATION PARTS AND TEST SAMPLES FOR CUSTOMERS WITH PRODUCTS IN DEVELOPMENT; AND III) PRODUCT LICENSING AND ROYALTY REVENUE. WE EXPECT THAT THESE SOURCES OF REVENUE WILL CONTINUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF OUR REVENUE MIX AS OPERATIONS ARE SCALED.  OUR COST OF SALES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THE COSTS OF MANUFACTURING, WHICH INCLUDE RAW ALLOY AND INTERNAL LABOR REQUIRED TO OPERATE OUR ON-SITE PRODUCTION CELLS. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CURRENTLY CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND RELATED BENEFITS, TRAVEL, CONSULTING AND PROFESSIONAL FEES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, INSURANCE, OFFICE AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES REPRESENT SALARIES, RELATED BENEFITS EXPENSES, CONSULTING AND CONTRACT SERVICES, EXPENSES INCURRED FOR THE DESIGN AND TESTING OF NEW PROCESSING METHODS, EXPENSES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SAMPLE AND PROTOTYPE PRODUCTS, AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF LIQUIDMETAL BULK ALLOYS. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. WE PLAN TO ENHANCE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION BY IMPROVING OUR EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES AND DEVELOPING ADVANCES IN AMORPHOUS ALLOY TECHNOLOGIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON THE DISCOVERY OF NEW ALLOY COMPOSITIONS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMPROVED PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF NEW APPLICATIONS FOR OUR ALLOYS.  IN JULY 2019, THE COMPANY ADOPTED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY ELECTED TO WIND DOWN ITS PRIOR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AT THE COMPANY\u2019S LAKE FOREST, CA FACILITY AND SEEK TO OUTSOURCE THE MANUFACTURE OF PARTS UTILIZING THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY THROUGH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING PARTNERS (THE \u201cJULY 2019 RESTRUCTURING PLAN\u201d).   IN CONNECTION WITH THE JULY 2019 RESTRUCTURING PLAN, THE COMPANY HAS SHIFTED ITS BUSINESS STRATEGY FROM INTERNAL MANUFACTURE OF PARTS AND PRODUCTS FOR CUSTOMERS TOWARD THE USE AND RELIANCE OF OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURERS, WHICH WILL INITIALLY BE DONGGUAN YIHAO METALS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. (\u201cYIHAO\u201d), A CHINA-BASED COMPANY THAT IS AN AFFILIATE OF OUR LARGEST BENEFICIAL STOCKHOLDER OUR CEO AND CHAIRMAN, PROFESSOR LUGEE LI.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LICENSING TRANSACTIONS  EONTEC LICENSE AGREEMENT  ON MARCH 10, 2016, IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2016 PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE ENTERED INTO A PARALLEL LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cLICENSE AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH DONGGUAN EONTEC CO., LTD., A HONG KONG CORPORATION (\u201cEONTEC\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH WE EACH ENTERED INTO A CROSS-LICENSE OF OUR RESPECTIVE TECHNOLOGIES.

(\u201cSWATCH\u201d) UNDER WHICH SWATCH WAS GRANTED A NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO OUR TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE AND MARKET WATCHES AND CERTAIN OTHER LUXURY PRODUCTS. IN MARCH 2011, THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT WAS AMENDED TO GRANT SWATCH EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS AS TO WATCHES AND ALL THIRD PARTIES (INCLUDING US), BUT NON-EXCLUSIVE AS TO APPLE, AND OUR LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH LLPG WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY AMENDED TO EXCLUDE WATCHES FROM LLPG\u2019S RIGHTS. WE WILL RECEIVE ROYALTY PAYMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT ON ALL LIQUIDMETAL PRODUCTS PRODUCED AND SOLD BY SWATCH. THE LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH SWATCH WILL EXPIRE ON THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE LAST LICENSED PATENT.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SINCE THESE POLICIES REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT OR INVOLVE COMPLEX ESTIMATES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.  \u2022  REVENUE RECOGNITION  \u2022  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES  \u2022  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS  \u2022  VALUATION OF WRITTEN CALL/ PUT OPTION LIABILITIES AND WARRANTS  \u2022  SHARE BASED COMPENSATION  OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 (THE \u201c2018 ANNUAL REPORT\u201d) CONTAINS FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON OF THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018  FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED JUNE 30,  FOR THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED JUNE 30,  2019  2018  2019  2018  (UNAUDITED)  (UNAUDITED)  (UNAUDITED)  (UNAUDITED)  IN 000'S% OF  PRODUCTS  REVENUE  IN 000'S% OF  PRODUCTS  REVENUE  IN 000'S% OF  PRODUCTS  REVENUE  IN 000'S% OF  PRODUCTS  REVENUE  REVENUE.

TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED TO $132 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $55 THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED TO $355 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $135 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER VOLUMES ASSOCIATED WITH EARLY-PRODUCTION ORDERS AND CONTINUED PROTOTYPING PROJECTS IN AN EFFORT TO BUILD A SIGNIFICANT, RECURRING, FUNNEL OF PRODUCTION BUSINESS DURING THE 2019 PERIOD AND PROSPECTIVELY.  COST OF  SALES  . COST OF SALES WAS $103, OR 78% OF PRODUCTS REVENUE, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, AN INCREASE FROM $61, OR 111% OF PRODUCTS REVENUE, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. COST OF SALES WAS $282, OR 79% OF PRODUCTS REVENUE, FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AN INCREASE FROM $142, OR 105% OF PRODUCTS REVENUE, FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  THE DECREASE IN OUR COST OF SALES AS A PERCENTAGE OF PRODUCTS REVENUE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER RAW MATERIAL COSTS AS A RESULT OF MARKET ADJUSTMENTS TAKEN DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PRODUCTION THROUGHPUT. WHEN WE BEGIN INCREASING OUR PRODUCTS REVENUES WITH SHIPMENTS OF ROUTINE, COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AND PARTS THROUGH OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND, IN FUTURE PERIODS, THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, WE EXPECT OUR COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES TO DECREASE, STABILIZE AND BE MORE PREDICTABLE.  GROSS  PROFIT  (  LOS  S)  . OUR GROSS PROFIT INCREASED TO $29 FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $(6) FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. OUR GROSS PROFIT (LOSS) AS A PERCENTAGE OF PRODUCTS REVENUE, INCREASED TO 22% FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM (11)% FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. OUR GROSS PROFIT (LOSS) INCREASED TO $73 FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $(7) FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. OUR GROSS PROFIT (LOSS), AS A PERCENTAGE OF PRODUCTS REVENUE, INCREASED TO 21% FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM (5)% FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  EARLY PROTOTYPE AND PRE-PRODUCTION ORDERS GENERALLY RESULT IN A HIGHER COST MIX, RELATIVE TO REVENUE, THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE INCURRED IN AN ON-SITE PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT, WITH HIGHER VOLUMES AND MORE ESTABLISHED OPERATING PROCESSES, OR THROUGH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS. AS SUCH, OUR GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGES HAVE FLUCTUATED AND MAY CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE BASED ON VOLUME AND QUOTED PRODUCTION PRICES PER UNIT AND MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR FUTURE BUSINESS. WHEN WE BEGIN INCREASING OUR PRODUCTS REVENUES WITH SHIPMENTS OF ROUTINE, COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AND PARTS THROUGH FUTURE ORDERS TO OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND, IN FUTURE PERIODS, THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, WE EXPECT OUR GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGES TO STABILIZE, INCREASE, AND BE MORE PREDICTABLE.  SELLING, MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  . SELLING, MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $1,275 AND $2,708 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO $1,527 AND $3,112 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN EXPENSES WAS DUE TO OVERALL LOWER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AS A RESULT OF PRIOR PERIOD HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  . RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE $406 AND $895 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO $644 AND $1,254 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE IN EXPENSE WAS MAINLY DUE TO REDUCTION IN MOLD, TOOLING, AND ALLOY DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES. WE CONTINUE TO (I) PERFORM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LIQUIDMETAL ALLOYS AND RELATED PROCESSING CAPABILITIES, (II) DEVELOP NEW MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES, AND (III) CONTRACT WITH CONSULTANTS TO ADVANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIQUIDMETAL ALLOYS AND RELATED PRODUCTION PROCESSES.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE JULY 2019 RESTRUCTURING PLAN, NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $1,676 WERE RECORDED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS A RESULT OF CHANGED ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE ASSET GROUPING AND FUTURE USE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING ASSETS. SIMILAR CHARGES WERE NOT RECORDED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  OPERATING LOSS  . OPERATING LOSS WAS $3,333 AND $5,211 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THIS COMPARES TO $2,177 AND $4,373 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING LOSS ARE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO VARIATIONS IN OPERATING EXPENSES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  AS A RESULT OF THE JULY 2019 RESTRUCTURING PLAN, WE ANTICIPATE THAT ON-GOING OPERATING SELLING, MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND RESEARCH AN DEVELOPMENT WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED, PRIMARILY THROUGH EMPLOYEE HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS AND THE OUTSOURCING OF DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE TO EXPEDITE THE ADOPTION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY, BUT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED LONG SALES LEAD TIMES FOR CUSTOMER ADOPTION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY. UNTIL THAT TIME WHEN WE CAN EITHER (I) INCREASE OUR REVENUES WITH SHIPMENTS OF ROUTINE, COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AND PARTS THROUGH THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR (II) OBTAIN SIGNIFICANT LICENSING REVENUES, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  OTHER INCOME AND  EXPENSE  S  INTEREST INCOME.  INTEREST INCOME RELATES TO INTEREST EARNED FROM OUR CASH DEPOSITS FOR THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS. SUCH AMOUNTS WERE $109 AND $219 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THIS COMPARES TO $35 AND $68 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $2,456 AND $3,383 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE CASH WAS PRIMARILY USED TO FUND OPERATING EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.  CASH  USED IN  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $592 AND $71 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. INVESTING OUTFLOWS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT AND BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE WILL SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASE BASED ON THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED SHIFT IN OUR MANUFACTURING STRATEGY.  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $14 AND $47 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IS COMPRISED OF CASH RECEIVED FOR THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES FOLLOWING THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND OUTLOOK  DURING 2016, WE RAISED A TOTAL OF $62,700 THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF 405,000,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN MULTIPLE CLOSINGS UNDER THE 2016 PURCHASE AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY HAS A RELATIVELY LIMITED HISTORY OF PRODUCING BULK AMORPHOUS ALLOY PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS ON A MASS-PRODUCTION SCALE. FURTHERMORE, THE ABILITY OF FUTURE CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS IN DESIRED QUANTITIES AND AT COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE PRICES IS UNCERTAIN AND IS DEPENDENT ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL, INCLUDING THE NATURE AND DESIGN OF THE COMPONENT, THE CUSTOMER\u2019S SPECIFICATIONS, AND REQUIRED DELIVERY TIMELINES. THESE FACTORS HAVE PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED THAT THE COMPANY ENGAGE IN EQUITY SALES UNDER VARIOUS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENTS TO SUPPORT ITS OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. AS A RESULT OF THE FUNDING UNDER THE 2016 PURCHASE AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ITS CURRENT CAPITAL RESOURCES, WHEN CONSIDERING EXPECTED LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "LIQUIDMETAL TECHNOLOGIES INC", "CIK": 1141240, "Date": "2019-08-16T00:00:00", "Ticker": "LQMT", "Name": "Liquidmetal Technologies Inc", "Exchange": "OTCBB", "SIC": 2800.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 330264467.0, "key": "20190816LQMT", "labelr1": 11.11111111111112, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5972182, "prof1": 0.40278175, "return1&2": 0.8888888888888888, "return1&2&3": 0.8888888888888888, "return1&2&3&4": 0.8888888888888888, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 0.8888888888888888, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 11.111111111111116, "cumulative_return1": 0.5397983916919038, "cumulative_return1&2": 3.1437861993840515, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 27.483582791444935, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 456.0292185647718, "indexx": 2311, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.035759110443109, "cumreturn1b": 0.9804100857961211, "cumreturndow": 0.9898731847660052, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9831612764530135}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2322, "level_0": 2382, "index": 67960, "text": "ITEM 2.

OVERVIEW  EVOLVING SYSTEMS, INC. IS A PROVIDER OF REAL-TIME DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, SIM AND NUMBER MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO WIRELESS OPERATORS. WE OPERATE A MANAGED SERVICES BUSINESS MODEL THROUGH WHICH WE MAINTAIN LONG-STANDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANY OF THE LARGEST WIRELESS COMPANIES WORLDWIDE. THE COMPANY\u2019S PORTFOLIO INCLUDES MARKET-LEADING SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES FOR REAL-TIME ANALYTICS, CUSTOMER ACQUISITION AND ACTIVATION, CUSTOMER VALUE MANAGEMENT AND LOYALTY FOR THE TELECOM INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY HAS MOVED FROM SELLING TECHNOLOGY TO OFFERING BUSINESS SOLUTIONS. THE VALUE PROPOSITION LIKEWISE HAS MOVED AWAY FROM COST SAVINGS TO A FOCUS ON REVENUE INCREASES FOR THE CARRIER AND OUR BUSINESS MODEL HAS MOVED FROM CLASSIC CAPITAL EXPENDITURE LICENSE AND SERVICES TO OPERATING EXPENSE MODELS BASED ON MANAGED SERVICES WITH PERFORMANCE FEES.  IN 2017, WE COMPLETED OUR ACQUISITIONS OF BLS AND THE FOUR BUSINESS OPERATING UNITS OF THE \u201cLUMATA ENTITIES\u201d. BLS SOLUTIONS CAN TURN CUSTOMER DATA INTO ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS AND PERSONALIZED CONTEXTUAL OFFERS. CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT OCCURS THROUGH IN-BOUND AND OUT-BOUND OFFERS AND IS FURTHER EXTENDED THROUGH A SUITE OF LOYALTY AND RETENTION SOLUTIONS. THE LUMATA ENTITIES ARE A LEADING GLOBAL PROVIDER OF REAL-TIME, NEXT GENERATION LOYALTY AND CUSTOMER LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE AND SERVICES THAT HELP BUSINESSES GAIN VALUE FROM THEIR CUSTOMER DATA FOR RELEVANT AND CONTEXTUAL INSIGHTS AND ACTIONS OF VALUE TO BOTH CUSTOMERS AND ENTERPRISES. THE ACQUISITIONS GREW OUR CUSTOMER BASE TO INCLUDE WIRELESS CARRIERS ORANGE, TELEFONICA AND OTHER TIER-1 AND EMERGING WIRELESS CARRIERS IN EUROPE, ASIA, THE MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  IN 2019, WE ANNOUNCED EVOLUTION, THE NEW PLATFORM THAT SUPERSEDES AND PROVIDES AN UPGRADE PATH TO THE FORMER LOYALTY AND CVM PLATFORMS FROM BOTH EVOLVING AND ITS ACQUIRED COMPANIES \u2014 BLS, LUMATA AND SSM. EVOLUTION WAS BUILT BY COMBINING, INTEGRATING, AND IMPROVING UPON THE BEST COMPONENTS AND FEATURES OF THOSE PREVIOUS PLATFORMS. WE BELIEVE THAT EVOLUTION PROVIDES A UNIQUE CAPABILITY, AND WE EXPECT MUCH OF 2019 TO FOCUS ON SELLING AND PROMOTING THIS SIGNIFICANT NEW PRODUCT. OUR EXPERIENCED TEAM AND THE NEW TECHNOLOGY PROVIDE ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS AND RELEVANT OFFERS BASED ON CUSTOMER DATA, ALL OF WHICH GREATLY COMPLEMENTS OUR SOFTWARE PORTFOLIO AND 25 YEARS OF EXPERTISE IN CUSTOMER ACQUISITION, ACTIVATION AND RETENTION. ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR TECHNOLOGY FURTHER EXPANDS OUR MANAGED SERVICES PLATFORM FOR DELIVERING ON-TAP STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL SOLUTIONS.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THERE WAS A SUSTAINED DECLINE IN THE MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE PERFORMED AN INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERED, ALONG WITH OTHER POSSIBLE FACTORS AFFECTING THE ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S REPORTING UNIT FOR THE PURPOSES OF PERFORMING A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, INCLUDING MANAGEMENT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT EXPECTED FUTURE REVENUE FORECASTS AND DISCOUNT RATES, CHANGES IN THE OVERALL ECONOMY, TRENDS IN THE STOCK PRICE, ESTIMATED CONTROL PREMIUM, OTHER OPERATING CONDITIONS, AND THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND GOODWILL. AS A RESULT OF THE SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE CURRENT MARKET CAPITALIZATION DESPITE ANY OF THE OTHER POSITIVE FACTORS CONTEMPLATED AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, THE OUTCOME OF THIS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTED IN A CHARGE FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL FOR THE REMAINING CARRYING VALUE OF $6.7 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  CONSOLIDATED REVENUE WAS $6.3 MILLION AND $8.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND $13.0 MILLION AND $16.3 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018. THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO THE DECLINE IN SERVICES  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUE WITH OUR HISTORICAL CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH NON-RENEWALS OF ON-GOING SERVICES OR CONCLUSION OF LARGE PROJECTS, OFFSET BY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN LICENSE FEES AND NEW CLIENT ENGAGEMENTS.  WE HAVE OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS USED TO PREPARE THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHICH ARE TRANSLATED INTO OUR REPORTING CURRENCY, U.S. DOLLARS. CHANGES IN THE EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THESE CURRENCIES AND OUR REPORTING CURRENCY ARE PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE CHANGES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENT AMOUNTS. THE MAJORITY OF THE CHANGES IN 2019 AND 2018 ARE A RESULT OF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENING ON AVERAGE VERSUS THE BRITISH POUND STERLING. THE CHART BELOW SUMMARIZES WHAT THE EFFECTS ON OUR REVENUE AND EXPENSES WOULD BE ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS. THE CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS ASSUMES THAT THE EXCHANGE RATE WAS CONSTANT FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED (IN THOUSANDS).

CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES INCLUDE ANNUAL SUPPORT FEES, RECURRING MAINTENANCE FEES, MINOR PRODUCT UPGRADES AND WARRANTY FEES. WARRANTY FEES ARE TYPICALLY DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE WARRANTY PERIOD.  LICENSE FEES  LICENSE FEES REVENUE WAS $0.3 MILLION AND $0.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN REVENUES OF $0.1 MILLION IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN NUMBER OF FIRST USER ACTIVATION LICENSES TO AN EXISTING CLIENT.  LICENSE FEES REVENUE WAS $1.0 MILLION AND $0.6 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN REVENUES OF $0.4 MILLION IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN NUMBER OF INCREMENTAL LICENSES TO AN EXISTING CLIENT.  SERVICES  SERVICES REVENUE DECREASED $1.9 MILLION, OR 24%, TO $6.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $7.9 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE DECREASE IS RELATED TO $1.5 MILLION IN LOST SERVICE REVENUE FROM CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS NOT RENEWING OR DECREASE IN SERVICES OR PRICING TO EXISTING CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. SECOND QUARTER 2018 ALSO HAD MANY ON-GOING LARGE PROJECTS, MOSTLY RELATED TO THE COMPANIES THAT WE ACQUIRED, CAUSING A DECREASE OF $0.8 MILLION PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $0.4 MILLION RELATED TO NEW IMPLEMENTATIONS.  SERVICES REVENUE DECREASED $3.7 MILLION, OR 24%, TO $12.0 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $15.7 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE DECREASE IS RELATED TO $3.2 MILLION IN LOST SERVICE REVENUE FROM CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS NOT RENEWING OR DECREASE IN SERVICES OR PRICING TO EXISTING CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. FIRST HALF OF 2018 ALSO HAD MANY LARGE PROJECTS, MOSTLY RELATED TO THE COMPANIES THAT WE ACQUIRED, CAUSING A DECREASE OF $1.3 MILLION PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $0.8 MILLION RELATED TO NEW IMPLEMENTATIONS.  COSTS OF REVENUE, EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  COSTS OF REVENUE, EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL COSTS AND OTHER DIRECT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PERSONNEL, FACILITIES COSTS, COSTS OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE AND PARTNER COMMISSIONS. COSTS OF REVENUE INCLUDES PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES RELATED TO SOFTWARE FEATURES REQUESTED IN ADVANCE OF THEIR SCHEDULED AVAILABILITY WHICH ARE FUNDED BY CUSTOMERS AS PART OF A MANAGED SERVICE OFFERING. COSTS OF REVENUE, EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, DECREASED $0.7 MILLION, OR 25%, TO $2.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $2.9 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE DECREASE IN COSTS OF REVENUE OF $0.5 MILLION IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER SERVICE PROJECT HOURS ALLOWING RESOURCES TO WORK ON INTERNAL PROJECTS AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

WE ARE NEGOTIATING AMENDMENTS TO THE LOAN AGREEMENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY FINANCED OPERATIONS THROUGH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND BANK BORROWINGS. AT JUNE 30, 2019, OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY WAS $5.3 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND $8.5 MILLION IN CONTRACT RECEIVABLES, NET OF ALLOWANCES.

RISK FACTORS\u201d, OUR TERM LOAN BORROWINGS REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM CURRENT RATIO, A SPECIFIED RATIO OF TOTAL LIABILITIES TO EBITDA AND A MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN THE TERM LOAN AND THE LOAN FACILITY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO WAS 0.81, WHICH FAILED TO MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIRED 1.25 FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE RISKS WHICH IMPACT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND OUR CONSOLIDATED EQUITY, AS WELL AS OUR CONSOLIDATED CASH POSITION DUE TO TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES RESULTED IN DECREASES IN CASH OF LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION AND $0.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND DEBT REDUCTION AND IS TARGETING TOTAL WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS OF $30.0 MILLION FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR.  \u2022  THE COMPANY RECENTLY MADE THE DECISION TO REPOSITION ITS FRESH PRODUCTION OPERATIONS.  AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE, THE COMPANY\u2019S FRESH PRODUCTION OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE  THE HIGH-QUALITY CUT FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND CORE DELI OFFERINGS SUCH AS SALADS, SANDWICHES AND WRAPS THAT HAVE BEEN A HALLMARK OF THESE OPERATIONS FOR OVER A DECADE. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY WILL EXIT THE FRESH KITCHEN OPERATIONS, AN AREA OF THE BUSINESS WHICH HAS BEEN UNABLE TO DELIVER ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS  , RESULTING IN LOWER VOLUME PRODUCTION RUNS WHICH WERE NEITHER EFFICIENT NOR PROFITABLE, SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTING TO UNFAVORABLE PERFORMANCE WITHIN THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT.  THE ANNUAL NET SALES IMPACT OF EXITING THE FRESH KITCHEN OPERATIONS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019, THE COMPANY EXPECTS FOOD DISTRIBUTION TO ACHIEVE LOW- TO MID-SINGLE DIGIT SALES GROWTH DRIVEN BY EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND NEW BUSINESS. THIS EXPECTATION EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY SALES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE MARTIN\u2019S BUSINESS. IN THE MILITARY SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT NEW BUSINESS WITHIN THE SEGMENT, INCLUDING CONTINUED PRIVATE BRAND GROWTH, WILL LARGELY OFFSET THE NEGATIVE DECA COMPARABLE SALES TREND. WITHIN THE RETAIL SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TOTAL SALES WILL INCREASE DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S AND THE SIGNIFICANT CURRENT YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BRAND POSITIONING, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF STORE RATIONALIZATION PLANS.

NET SALES FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD ENDED JULY 13, 2019 (\u201cYEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD\u201d) INCREASED $257.3 MILLION, OR 6.0%, TO $4.54 BILLION FROM $4.28 BILLION IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD ENDED JULY 14, 2018 (\u201cPRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD\u201d). THE INCREASES WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREMENTAL SALES FROM THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION.  FOOD DISTRIBUTION NET SALES DECREASED $6.3 MILLION, OR 0.7%, TO $935.4 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER FROM $941.7 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. NET SALES FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD INCREASED $7.7 MILLION, OR 0.4%, FROM $2.10 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD. BEFORE THE IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF SALES TO MARTIN\u2019S, FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION AT THE BEGINNING OF 2019, SALES GREW 3.0% AND 4.2% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY. THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE INCREASES EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE MARTIN\u2019S ELIMINATION WERE DUE TO SALES GROWTH FROM EXISTING CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY\u2019S RATE OF SALES GROWTH WITHIN THIS SEGMENT DECELERATED FROM RECENT QUARTERS, LARGELY DUE TO UNSEASONABLY COOL AND WET WEATHER DURING THE MONTHS OF MAY AND JUNE. THESE TRENDS IMPROVED DURING THE MONTH OF JULY AS THE WEATHER IMPROVED AND THE RATE OF GROWTH RETURNED TO THAT OBSERVED IN RECENT QUARTERS.  MILITARY NET SALES INCREASED $0.9 MILLION, OR 0.2%, TO $490.6 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER FROM $489.7 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. NET SALES FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD INCREASED $8.7 MILLION, OR 0.8%, FROM $1.15 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD TO $1.16 BILLION. THE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL VOLUME FROM NEW BUSINESS WITH AN EXISTING CUSTOMER THAT COMMENCED LATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND GROWTH IN DECA\u2019S PRIVATE BRAND PROGRAM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMPARABLE SALES AT DECA OPERATED LOCATIONS.  RETAIL NET SALES INCREASED $105.4 MILLION, OR 22.7%, TO $570.0 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER FROM $464.6 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  NET SALES FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD INCREASED $240.9 MILLION, OR 23.4%, FROM $1.03 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD TO $1.27 BILLION.  THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREMENTAL SALES FROM THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF MARTIN\u2019S, SALES DECREASED 3.3% AND 3.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY, AS A RESULT OF STORE CLOSURES AND NEGATIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES. COMPARABLE STORE SALES, EXCLUDING FUEL, DECREASED 2.0% FOR THE QUARTER  AND DECREASED 1.1% PERCENT FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD  . COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR THE QUARTER WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE SHIFT OF THE POST-EASTER WEEK INTO THE SECOND QUARTER BY 0.5%. THE COMPANY DEFINES A RETAIL STORE AS COMPARABLE WHEN IT IS IN OPERATION FOR 14 ACCOUNTING PERIODS (A PERIOD EQUALS FOUR WEEKS), REGARDLESS OF REMODELS, EXPANSIONS OR RELOCATED STORES. THE COMPANY\u2019S DEFINITION OF COMPARABLE STORE SALES MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES AT OTHER COMPANIES.  GROSS PROFIT  \u2013 GROSS PROFIT REPRESENTS NET SALES LESS COST OF SALES, WHICH FOR ALL NON-PRODUCTION OPERATIONS INCLUDES PURCHASE COSTS, IN-BOUND FREIGHT, PHYSICAL INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS, MARKDOWNS AND PROMOTIONAL ALLOWANCES AND EXCLUDES WAREHOUSING COSTS, DEPRECIATION AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S FOOD PROCESSING OPERATIONS, COST OF SALES INCLUDES DIRECT PRODUCT AND PRODUCTION COSTS, INBOUND FREIGHT, PURCHASING AND RECEIVING COSTS, UTILITIES, DEPRECIATION, AND OTHER INDIRECT PRODUCTION COSTS AND EXCLUDES OUT-BOUND FREIGHT AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE COMPANY\u2019S GROSS PROFIT DEFINITION MAY NOT BE IDENTICAL TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. VENDOR ALLOWANCES THAT RELATE TO THE BUYING AND MERCHANDISING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PROMOTIONAL ALLOWANCES, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ALLOWANCES ON PURCHASED QUANTITIES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, SLOTTING ALLOWANCES, WHICH ARE BILLED TO VENDORS FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S MERCHANDISING COSTS, SUCH AS SETTING UP WAREHOUSE INFRASTRUCTURE. VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION IN COST OF SALES WHEN THE PRODUCT IS SOLD. LUMP SUM PAYMENTS RECEIVED FOR MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACTS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL TERMS. THE DISTRIBUTION SEGMENTS INCLUDE SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS IN THE SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SECTION OF OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.  GROSS PROFIT INCREASED $23.3 MILLION, OR 8.8%, TO $289.0 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER FROM $265.7 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT WAS 14.5% COMPARED TO 14.0% IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. GROSS PROFIT FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD INCREASED $57.9 MILLION, OR 9.5%, FROM $608.9 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD TO $666.7 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD WAS 14.7% COMPARED TO 14.2% IN THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD. AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD CHANGE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARGINS IN OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  \u2013 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cSG&A\u201d) EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND WAGES, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, WAREHOUSING COSTS, STORE OCCUPANCY COSTS, SHIPPING AND HANDLING, UTILITIES, EQUIPMENT RENTAL, DEPRECIATION (TO THE EXTENT NOT INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES), OUT-BOUND FREIGHT AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  20  SG&A EXPENSES  INCREASED TO  $266.5  MILLION IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER  FROM  $236.2  MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, REPRESENTING  13.4%  OF NET SALES IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER COMPARED TO  12.5%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  SG&A EXPENSES FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD  IN  CREASED  $81.6  MILLION, OR  15.0%  ,  FROM  $545.3  MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD TO  $626.9  MILLION, AND  IN  CREASED  FROM  12.7%  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES IN THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD COMPARED TO  13.8%.  THE INCREASE IN EXPENSES AS A RATE OF SALES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER  AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO  AN INCREASE IN THE MIX OF RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATIONS WITH  THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S  AS WELL AS HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS IN BOTH MILITARY AND FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENTS.  THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY FAVORABLE VARIANCES RELATED TO INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSE ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS.  MERGER/ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION  \u2013 SECOND QUARTER AND PRIOR YEAR QUARTER RESULTS INCLUDED $0.6 MILLION AND $0.8 MILLION OF MERGER/ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY. THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD AND THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD RESULTS INCLUDED $1.4 MILLION AND $3.0 MILLION OF MERGER/ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY. THE EXPENSES ARE MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION OF MARTIN\u2019S IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND THE  INTEGRATION OF SPARTAN STORES, INC. AND NASH-FINCH COMPANY  IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES (GAINS) AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT \u2013  SECOND QUARTER AND PRIOR YEAR QUARTER RESULTS INCLUDED CHARGES OF $14.6 MILLION AND GAINS OF $1.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT ACTIVITY. THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD AND THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD RESULTS INCLUDED CHARGES OF $8.9 MILLION AND $5.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT ACTIVITY.

THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE AMOUNT INCLUDES CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S RETAIL STORE AND WAREHOUSE RATIONALIZATION PLANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  GOODWILL  THE COMPANY PERFORMS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT IT WOULD BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, THE COMPANY ASSESSED WHETHER THERE WERE ANY INDICATORS THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION REPORTING UNIT WAS IN EXCESS OF ITS FAIR VALUE. ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS PERFORMED BY THE COMPANY IS WHETHER THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ENTERPRISE AS A WHOLE IS GREATER THAN THE MARKET CAPITALIZATION, CONSIDERING A REASONABLE CONTROL PREMIUM. AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER AND INTO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 THE DECLINE IN THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK PRICE SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASED MARKET CAPITALIZATION, AND THE DECLINE BECAME SUSTAINED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER. AS A RESULT OF THIS INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANY PERFORMED AN INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION REPORTING UNIT, THE ONLY REPORTING UNIT WHICH CARRIES A GOODWILL BALANCE.  THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION REPORTING UNIT PRIMARILY BASED ON THE INCOME APPROACH USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL AND ALSO INCORPORATES THE MARKET APPROACH USING OBSERVABLE COMPARABLE COMPANY INFORMATION. AS A RESULT OF THE SECOND QUARTER IMPAIRMENT TEST, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION REPORTING UNIT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY IN EXCESS OF ITS CARRYING VALUE.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED BY THE COMPANY IN PREPARING THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE UNDER THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD INCLUDE.  \u2022  WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL (\u201cWACC\u201d): THE DETERMINATION OF THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL INCORPORATES CURRENT INTEREST RATES, EQUITY RISK PREMIUMS, AND OTHER MARKET-BASED EXPECTATIONS REGARDING EXPECTED INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WACC REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF AN EQUITY RATE OF RETURN AND A DEBT RATE OF RETURN, WHICH ARE SPECIFIC TO THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION REPORTING UNIT OPERATES.  \u2022  REVENUE GROWTH RATES: THE COMPANY DEVELOPS ITS FORECASTS BASED ON RECENT SALES DATA FOR EXISTING OPERATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING MANAGEMENT\u2019S FUTURE EXPECTATIONS.  \u2022  OPERATING PROFITS: THE COMPANY USES HISTORICAL OPERATING MARGINS AS A BASIS FOR OUR PROJECTIONS WITHIN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL. MARGINS WITHIN THE FORECAST MAY VARY DUE TO FUTURE EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO BOTH PRODUCT AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.  THE COMPANY COMPARED THE RESULTS OF THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO OBSERVABLE COMPARABLE COMPANY MARKET MULTIPLES TO SUPPORT THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES. THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE IMPLIED MULTIPLE WAS REASONABLE WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPARABLE COMPANY RANGE, AND THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE WERE SUPPORTABLE.  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY RECONCILED THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE FOR THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION REPORTING UNIT TO THE CURRENT MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF THE ENTERPRISE AS A WHOLE. WHILE THE RETAIL AND MILITARY REPORTING UNITS DO NOT CARRY GOODWILL BALANCES, THEIR FAIR VALUES ARE COMBINED WITH THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE OF THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION REPORTING UNIT IN DETERMINING THE ENTERPRISE VALUE OF THE TOTAL COMPANY. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST, THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE ENTERPRISE VALUE OF THE COMPANY AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION, IMPLYING A REASONABLE CONTROL PREMIUM, WAS WITHIN THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPECTATIONS BASED ON RECENT MARKET TRANSACTIONS.  21  OPERATING EARNINGS  (LOSS)  \u2013  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OPERATING EARNINGS  (LOSS)  BY SEGMENT AND VARIANCES IN OPERATING EARNINGS  (LOSS)  .  12 WEEKS ENDED  28 WEEKS ENDED  (IN THOUSANDS)  JULY 13, 2019  JULY 14, 2018  VARIANCE  JULY 13, 2019  JULY 14, 2018  VARIANCE  FOOD DISTRIBUTION  $272  $18,724  $(18,452  )  $24,864  $43,245  $(18,381  )  MILITARY  (1,603  )  3,099  (4,702  )  (3,160  )  4,612  (7,772  )  RETAIL  8,701  7,995  706  7,875  7,709  166  TOTAL OPERATING EARNINGS  $7,370  $29,818  $(22,448  )  $29,579  $55,566  $(25,987  )  OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED $22.4 MILLION, OR 75.3% TO $7.4 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER FROM $29.8 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.

MILITARY OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED $4.7 MILLION, OR 151.7%, TO A $1.6 MILLION OPERATING LOSS IN THE SECOND QUARTER FROM $3.1 MILLION IN OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD DECREASED $7.8 MILLION, OR 168.5%, TO A $3.2 MILLION OPERATING LOSS FROM $4.6 MILLION IN OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD. THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE DECREASES WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER MARGIN RATES, PARTLY DUE TO A SHIFT IN THE MIX OF BUSINESS, AND HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS, AS WELL AS THE CYCLING OF GAINS RELATED TO THE SALE OF A CLOSED FACILITY IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS TO INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.

INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD INCREASED $4.9 MILLION, OR 30.7% FROM $15.7 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD TO $20.6 MILLION. THE INCREASES IN INTEREST EXPENSE WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR AND INCREMENTAL BORROWINGS TO FUND THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION.  INCOME TAXES  \u2013 THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 30.3% AND 22.7% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD AND PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD, THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES WERE -72.5% AND 24.8%, RESPECTIVELY. THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO STATE TAXES AND STOCK COMPENSATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FEDERAL TAX CREDITS. IN THE PRIOR YEAR, THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO STATE TAXES, FEDERAL TAX CREDITS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. THE TAX IMPACTS OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ARE PRIMARILY REALIZED IN THE FIRST QUARTER DUE TO THE TIMING OF AWARDS AND VESTING SCHEDULES.  22  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  IN ADDITION TO REPORTING FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES INFORMATION REGARDING ADJUSTED OPERATING EARNINGS, ADJUSTED EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201cADJUSTED EBITDA\u201d).

NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED DURING THE CURRENT YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD FROM THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD BY APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CASH GENERATED FROM EARNINGS, MOSTLY OFFSET BY IMPROVEMENTS IN WORKING CAPITAL.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $74.5 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION MADE IN THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF REAL PROPERTY FOR A PREVIOUSLY CLOSED SITE.  THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION, MILITARY AND RETAIL SEGMENTS UTILIZED 23.4%, 7.6% AND 69.0% OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $76.0 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR USE OF CASH PRIMARILY DUE TO BORROWINGS ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO FUND THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION.  NET CASH USED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  NET CASH USED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS CONTAINS THE NET CASH FLOWS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S RETAIL AND FOOD DISTRIBUTION DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF FACILITY MAINTENANCE EXPENDITURES.  DEBT MANAGEMENT  TOTAL DEBT, INCLUDING FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES, WAS $702.2 MILLION AND $698.1 MILLION AS OF JULY 13, 2019 AND DECEMBER 29, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL DEBT WAS DRIVEN BY THE CURRENT YEAR ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PAYMENTS.  LIQUIDITY  THE COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND ITS SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY WHICH HAS MAXIMUM AVAILABLE CREDIT OF $1.1 BILLION. AS OF JULY 13, 2019, THE SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY HAD OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OF $660.9 MILLION. ADDITIONAL AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S $1.1 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY ARE BASED ON STIPULATED ADVANCE RATES ON ELIGIBLE ASSETS, AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAIN EXCESS AVAILABILITY OF 10% OF THE BORROWING BASE, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY HAD EXCESS AVAILABILITY AFTER THE 10% COVENANT OF $249.0 MILLION AT JULY 13, 2019. PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASES OF OUTSTANDING SHARES ARE PERMITTED, PROVIDED THAT CERTAIN LEVELS OF EXCESS AVAILABILITY ARE MAINTAINED. THE CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES FOR THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT, OF WHICH $10.8 MILLION WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF JULY 13, 2019. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY MATURES DECEMBER 18, 2023 AND IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, AND DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE CASH FLOW AT OR ABOVE CURRENT LEVELS OR THAT THE COMPANY WILL MAINTAIN ITS ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY EXECUTED AN EARLY PAYMENT OF ITS TERM LOAN (TRANCHE A-2) IN THE AMOUNT OF $55.0 MILLION WITH AVAILABLE BORROWINGS FROM ITS REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO GENERATE INTEREST SAVINGS OF NEARLY $2 MILLION ANNUALLY AS A RESULT OF UTILIZING LOWER RATE FINANCING.  28  THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT RATIO (CURRENT ASSETS TO CURRENT LIABILITIES) WAS  1.76  -TO-  1 AT  JULY 13  , 201  9  COMPARED TO  2.10  -TO-  1 AT DECEMBER  29  , 201  8  ,  AND ITS INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS  $430.7  MILLION AT  JULY 13  , 201  9  COMPARED TO  $524.6  MILLION AT DECEMBER  29  , 201  8  . NET DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO WAS  0.50  -TO-  1 AT  JULY 13  , 201  9  COMPARED TO  0.49  -TO-  1 AT DECEMBER  29  , 201  8.  THE CURRENT YEAR RATIOS INCLUDE THE I  MPACT OF  THE  ADOPTION OF  THE  NEW LEASE STANDARD (ASU 2016-02)  AND THEREFORE LACK COMPARABILITY TO THE PRIOR YEAR RATIOS.  TOTAL NET DEBT IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT IS DEFINED AS LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES, PLUS CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES, LESS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE RATIO OF NET DEBT TO CAPITAL IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET DEBT, AS DEFINED PREVIOUSLY, BY TOTAL CAPITAL (NET DEBT PLUS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY). THE COMPANY BELIEVES BOTH MANAGEMENT AND ITS INVESTORS FIND THE INFORMATION USEFUL BECAUSE IT REFLECTS THE AMOUNT OF LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY AVAILABLE CASH AND TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS. TOTAL NET DEBT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES.  FOLLOWING IS A RECONCILIATION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES TO TOTAL NET LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES AS OF JULY 13, 2019 AND DECEMBER 29, 2018.

AT JULY 13, 2019, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANY\u2019S SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.  CASH DIVIDENDS  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JULY 13, 2019, THE COMPANY RETURNED $6.9 MILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS FROM DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. A 5.6% INCREASE IN THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND RATE FROM $0.18 PER SHARE TO $0.19 PER SHARE WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ANNOUNCED ON FEBRUARY 28, 2019. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO PAY A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND, ADOPTION OF A DIVIDEND POLICY DOES NOT COMMIT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO DECLARE FUTURE DIVIDENDS. EACH FUTURE DIVIDEND WILL BE CONSIDERED AND DECLARED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT ITS DISCRETION. WHETHER THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONTINUES TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION, ANTICIPATED PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF ITS CREDIT FACILITIES.  UNDER THE SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE COMPANY IS GENERALLY PERMITTED TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN ANY FISCAL YEAR UP TO AN AMOUNT SUCH THAT ALL CASH DIVIDENDS, TOGETHER WITH ANY CASH DISTRIBUTIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, DO NOT EXCEED $35.0 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS GENERALLY PERMITTED TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE SHARES IN EXCESS OF $35.0 MILLION IN ANY FISCAL YEAR SO LONG AS ITS EXCESS AVAILABILITY, AS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, IS IN EXCESS OF 10% OF THE TOTAL BORROWING BASE, AS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, BEFORE AND AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY HAS ALSO MADE CERTAIN COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS THAT EXTEND BEYOND JULY 13, 2019. THESE COMMITMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PURCHASE COMMITMENTS (AS DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018), STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT OF $10.8 MILLION AS OF JULY 13, 2019, AND INTEREST ON LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES.  29  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, THE COMPANY EVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO BAD DEBTS, INVENTORIES, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCOME TAXES, SELF-INSURANCE RESERVES, RESTRUCTURING COSTS, RETIREMENT BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT MAY NOT BE READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S ONGOING REVIEW, THE COMPANY MAKES ADJUSTMENTS IT CONSIDERS APPROPRIATE UNDER THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHERS SET FORTH IN ITEM 8, NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 SHOULD BE REVIEWED AS THEY ARE INTEGRAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

EACH DIVISION EXPERIENCED A YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE, BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE DECREASE IN NET SALES WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY APPLIED TECHNOLOGY. APPLIED TECHNOLOGY'S AG MARKET CONDITIONS DETERIORATED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED TO THE DIVISION'S EXPECTATIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND QUARTER. ABNORMAL WET WEATHER IN THE U.S. CAUSED CHALLENGING FIELD CONDITIONS WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED PLANTING AND APPLICATION ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD AND DROVE REDUCTIONS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND.  THE COMPANY'S OPERATING INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $10.6 MILLION  , DOWN  $6.1 MILLION  , OR  36.4%  , COMPARED  #  22  TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NEGATIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE AS A RESULT OF LOWER SALES VOLUME. OPERATING INCOME ALSO REFLECTED INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN BOTH THE APPLIED TECHNOLOGY AND AEROSTAR DIVISIONS.  NET INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS  $8.8 MILLION  , OR  $0.24  PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF  $13.7 MILLION  , OR  $0.38  PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, EXCLUDING DISCRETE ITEMS, WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF LAST YEAR AT APPROXIMATELY 19 PERCENT. THE PRIOR YEAR'S SECOND QUARTER NET INCOME BENEFITED FROM APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION OF FAVORABLE DISCRETE TAX ITEMS THAT DID NOT REOCCUR IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2019, NET SALES WERE  $196.2 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $213.8 MILLION  , DOWN  8.2%  VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. ENGINEERED FILMS WAS THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN NET SALES DUE TO ITS $8.1   MILLION DECREASE IN HURRICANE RECOVERY FILM SALES AND END-MARKET CHALLENGES IN THE INDUSTRIAL AND GEOMEMBRANE MARKETS.  THE COMPANY'S OPERATING INCOME WAS  $25.7 MILLION  , DOWN  32.7%  FROM THE PRIOR YEAR SIX-MONTH PERIOD. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NEGATIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE AS A RESULT OF LOWER SALES VOLUME. OPERATING INCOME ALSO INCLUDED INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN BOTH APPLIED TECHNOLOGY AND AEROSTAR COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  NET INCOME FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 WAS  $22.0 MILLION  , OR  $0.60  PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF  $35.8 MILLION  , OR  $0.98  PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD.

APPLIED TECHNOLOGY DIVISION RESULTS  APPLIED TECHNOLOGY'S NET SALES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE  $27.4 MILLION  , DOWN  $3.0 MILLION  FROM LAST YEAR'S SECOND QUARTER. GEOGRAPHICALLY, INTERNATIONAL SALES WERE UP 3.4% YEAR-OVER-YEAR, BUT DOMESTIC SALES WERE DOWN  $3.2 MILLION  , OR  13.6%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR. INTERNATIONAL SALES GROWTH WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY STRONG GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA AS A RESULT OF THE DIVISION'S INVESTMENT INTO THE REGION AND STRONG OEM RELATIONSHIPS. CHALLENGING FIELD CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. LED TO LOWER LEVELS OF FIELD APPLICATION ACTIVITIES BY AG RETAILERS AND EXTENDED OEM PLANT SHUTDOWNS, WHICH PRIMARILY CAUSED THE DECREASE IN DOMESTIC SALES.  OPERATING INCOME FOR APPLIED TECHNOLOGY WAS  $4.8 MILLION  , DOWN $4.0 MILLION OR  44.8%  COMPARED TO  $8.8 MILLION  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. LOWER SALES VOLUME AND CORRESPONDING NEGATIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE PRIMARILY DROVE THE DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME.

GEOGRAPHICALLY, INTERNATIONAL SALES WERE UP  8.3%  YEAR-OVER-YEAR AND DOMESTIC SALES WERE DOWN  5.9%  YEAR-OVER-YEAR. INTERNATIONAL SALES GROWTH WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY STRONG GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA AS A RESULT OF THE DIVISION'S INVESTMENT INTO THE REGION AND STRONG OEM RELATIONSHIPS. CHALLENGING FIELD CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. LED TO LOWER LEVELS OF FIELD APPLICATION ACTIVITIES BY AG RETAILERS AND EXTENDED OEM PLANT SHUTDOWNS, WHICH CAUSED THE DECREASE IN DOMESTIC SALES.  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 WAS  $18.1 MILLION  , DOWN  26.9%  COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. THE INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDED INCREMENTAL INVESTMENTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF AGSYNC. PRIOR YEAR OPERATING INCOME ALSO INCLUDED FAVORABLE LEGAL RECOVERIES THAT DID NOT REOCCUR IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020.  ENGINEERED FILMS DIVISION RESULTS  ENGINEERED FILMS\u2019 FISCAL 2020 SECOND QUARTER NET SALES WERE  $57.5 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  $1.4 MILLION  , OR  2.3%  , COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 SECOND QUARTER NET SALES OF  $58.9 MILLION  . THE DIVISION EXPERIENCED END-MARKET CHALLENGES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER IN THE GEOMEMBRANE MARKET AS WELL AS LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED CUSTOMER DEMAND IN THE INDUSTRIAL MARKET. THESE CHALLENGES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET AS THE DIVISION CAUGHT UP ON THE FULFILLMENT OF SALES ORDERS THAT WERE DELAYED FROM THE FIRST QUARTER DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (ERP) PLATFORM.  OPERATING INCOME FOR ENGINEERED FILMS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED  6.1%  TO  $10.2 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $10.8  #  23  MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR SECOND QUARTER. OPERATING INEFFICIENCIES EXPERIENCED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPANY'S NEW ERP PLATFORM WERE LARGELY RESOLVED IN THE SECOND QUARTER; HOWEVER, HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT TO THE DIVISION'S OPERATING INCOME. THE DIVISION EXPECTS TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL EFFICIENCY GAINS AS IT GROWS AND MATURES IN ITS USE OF THE NEW SYSTEM.  NET SALES FOR ENGINEERED FILMS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 WERE  $101.8 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  $17.1 MILLION  , OR  14.4%  , COMPARED TO THE YEAR-TO-DATE SIX-MONTH PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019. HURRICANE RECOVERY FILM SALES WERE DOWN  $8.1 MILLION  IN THE FIRST SIX-MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DIVISION ALSO EXPERIENCED END-MARKET CHALLENGES IN THE GEOMEMBRANE MARKET AS WELL AS LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED CUSTOMER DEMAND IN THE INDUSTRIAL MARKET.  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED  31.2%  TO  $16.5 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $24.0 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY NEGATIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE ON LOWER SALES VOLUME.  AEROSTAR DIVISION RESULTS  AEROSTAR NET SALES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE  $13.2 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  $0.3 MILLION  , OR  2.4%  , COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 SECOND QUARTER NET SALES OF  $13.5 MILLION  . THE DIVISION ACHIEVED YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN ITS CORE STRATOSPHERIC BALLOON AND RADAR PRODUCT LINES; HOWEVER, AEROSTAT SALES DECLINED $3.8 MILLION VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR'S SECOND QUARTER AND DROVE THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE IN DIVISION NET SALES.  OPERATING INCOME FOR AEROSTAR IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS  $2.9 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $3.8 MILLION  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY REDUCED AEROSTAT SALES THAT GENERATED ABOVE DIVISION AVERAGE MARGINS. IN ADDITION, THE DIVISION INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SELLING EXPENSES TO FOCUS ON ADVANCING ITS ENGINEERING SERVICES AND FLIGHT OPERATIONS CAPABILITIES AND TO SUPPORT A CONSISTENT CADENCE OF FULFILLING FUTURE CONTRACTS.  NET SALES FOR AEROSTAR IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 WERE  $25.4 MILLION  , AN INCREASE OF  $1.0 MILLION  , OR  3.9%  , COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. STRONG GROWTH IN THE DIVISION'S CORE STRATOSPHERIC BALLOON AND RADAR SALES DROVE THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE.  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE SIX-MONTH YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF FISCAL 2020 WAS  $4.9 MILLION  COMPARED TO OPERATING INCOME OF  $6.6 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. DESPITE THE INCREASE IN NET SALES, OPERATING INCOME DECREASED DUE TO INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SELLING EXPENSES TO FOCUS ON ADVANCING ITS ENGINEERING SERVICES AND FLIGHT OPERATIONS CAPABILITIES AND TO SUPPORT A CONSISTENT CADENCE OF FULFILLING FUTURE CONTRACTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - SEGMENT ANALYSIS  APPLIED TECHNOLOGY  APPLIED TECHNOLOGY DESIGNS, MANUFACTURES, SELLS, AND SERVICES INNOVATIVE PRECISION AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT TOOLS, WHICH ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS PRECISION AGRICULTURE EQUIPMENT, THAT HELP FARMERS REDUCE COSTS, MORE PRECISELY CONTROL INPUTS, AND IMPROVE FARM YIELDS FOR THE GLOBAL AGRICULTURE MARKET.

THE FOLLOWING FACTORS WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE THREE- AND SIX-MONTH YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGES.  \u2022  MARKET CONDITIONS.  MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE AG MARKET DETERIORATED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED TO THE DIVISION'S EXPECTATIONS  #  24  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND QUARTER. ABNORMAL WET WEATHER IN THE U.S. CAUSED CHALLENGING FIELD CONDITIONS WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED PLANTING AND APPLICATION ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD AND DROVE REDUCTIONS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND. GIVEN THE CHALLENGES BEING FACED, SEVERAL KEY OEMS RESPONDED WITH PLANT SHUTDOWNS IN ORDER TO RECALIBRATE PRODUCTION LEVELS TO ALIGN WITH A LOWER FORECAST OF NEW MACHINE SALES. THIS TEMPORARILY HALTED SPRAYER UNIT PRODUCTION. AS A RESULT, APPLIED TECHNOLOGY'S OEM AND AFTERMARKET DEMAND IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT GENERALLY MODEL COMPARATIVE MARKET SHARE POSITION FOR ITS DIVISIONS, BUT THE COMPANY BELIEVES APPLIED TECHNOLOGY MAINTAINED ITS MARKET SHARE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  \u2022  SALES VOLUME AND SELLING PRICES.  SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2020 NET SALES DECREASED  $3.0 MILLION  OR  9.9%  , TO  $27.4 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $30.4 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. YEAR-TO-DATE SALES DECREASED  2.4%  TO  $69.1 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $70.8 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. LOWER SALES VOLUME OF BOTH NEW AND EXISTING PRODUCTS, RATHER THAN A CHANGE IN SELLING PRICE, WAS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THIS DECREASE. GEOGRAPHICALLY IN THE SECOND QUARTER, INTERNATIONAL SALES WERE UP  3.4%  YEAR-OVER-YEAR, AND DOMESTIC SALES WERE DOWN  13.6%  YEAR-OVER-YEAR. FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD, INTERNATIONAL SALES TOTALED  $19.1 MILLION  , AN INCREASE OF  8.3%  FROM PRIOR YEAR. INTERNATIONAL SALES GROWTH FOR BOTH PERIODS WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA AS A RESULT OF THE DIVISION'S INVESTMENT INTO THE REGION AND STRONG OEM RELATIONSHIPS. LONGER THAN EXPECTED OEM PLANT SHUTDOWNS AND LIMITED APPLICATION ACTIVITIES BY AG RETAILERS DROVE A DECLINE IN SALES DOMESTICALLY.  \u2022  INTERNATIONAL SALES.  FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, INTERNATIONAL SALES TOTALED  $7.0 MILLION  , UP  3.4%  FROM  $6.8 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. INTERNATIONAL SALES REPRESENTED  25.6%  OF SEGMENT REVENUE COMPARED TO  22.3%  OF SEGMENT REVENUE IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. YEAR-TO-DATE, INTERNATIONAL SALES TOTALED  $19.1 MILLION  , AN INCREASE OF  $1.5 MILLION  FROM A YEAR AGO. YEAR-TO-DATE INTERNATIONAL SALES REPRESENTED  27.7%  OF SEGMENT SALES COMPARED TO  25.0%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. THE YEAR-TO-DATE INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL SALES WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA AS A RESULT OF THE DIVISION'S INVESTMENT INTO THE REGION. THE DIVISION'S COMMITMENT TO INCREASE ITS LATIN AMERICA PRESENCE AND INTRODUCE ITS MARKET-LEADING TECHNOLOGIES TO ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST AG ECONOMIES IS EXPECTED TO BE A STRONG CONTRIBUTOR TO THE DIVISION'S FUTURE GROWTH.  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN.  GROSS MARGIN DECREASED FROM  52.1%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR SECOND QUARTER TO  47.5%  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. YEAR-TO-DATE FISCAL 2020 GROSS MARGIN DECREASED FROM  52.3%  TO  49.7%  COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN PROFITABILITY FOR THE THREE- AND SIX-MONTH PERIODS WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER SALES VOLUME AND A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN OPERATING LEVERAGE.  \u2022  OPERATING EXPENSES.  FISCAL 2020 SECOND QUARTER OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS  29.8%  , UP FROM  23.1%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. YEAR-TO-DATE OPERATING EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WERE UP FROM  17.3%  TO  23.5%  . THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE THREE- AND SIX-MONTH PERIODS WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREMENTAL INVESTMENTS IN SELLING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES TO ACCELERATE THE INTEGRATION AND GROWTH OF THE RECENTLY ACQUIRED AGSYNC. INCREMENTAL INVESTMENTS ARE INCREASING THE SPEED OF PRODUCT INTEGRATION AND ADOPTION INTO THE MARKETPLACE. ADDITIONALLY, PRIOR YEAR OPERATING EXPENSES BENEFITED FROM FAVORABLE LEGAL RECOVERIES WHICH DID NOT REPEAT IN FISCAL 2020.  ENGINEERED FILMS  ENGINEERED FILMS PRODUCES HIGH-PERFORMANCE PLASTIC FILMS AND SHEETING FOR GEOMEMBRANE, AGRICULTURAL, CONSTRUCTION, AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS AND ALSO OFFERS DESIGN-BUILD AND INSTALLATION SERVICES OF THESE PLASTIC FILMS AND SHEETING.

THE FOLLOWING FACTORS WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE THREE- AND SIX-MONTH YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGES.  \u2022  MARKET CONDITIONS.  THE ENERGY MARKET IN THE SECOND QUARTER EXPERIENCED SLOWER DEMAND COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR'S SECOND QUARTER AS WEST TEXAS INTERMEDIATE (WTI) OIL PRICES AND PERMIAN BASIN RIG COUNTS DECREASED 17 PERCENT AND 6 PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY EXPECTS ENERGY MARKET RELATED DEMAND FOR ENGINEERED FILMS TO FOLLOW PERMIAN  #  25  BASIN RIG COUNTS IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.  \u2022  SALES VOLUME AND SELLING PRICES  . SECOND QUARTER NET SALES WERE  $57.5 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  $1.4 MILLION  , OR  2.3%  , COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 SECOND QUARTER NET SALES OF  $58.9 MILLION  .

A YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN SALES VOLUME, AS OPPOSED TO A DECREASE IN SELLING PRICE, WAS THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE DECLINE IN NET SALES. SALES VOLUME, MEASURED IN POUNDS SOLD,  DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 3% AND 11% YEAR-OVER-YEAR FOR THE THREE- AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDING  JULY 31, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN PRIOR YEAR'S FIRST HALF NET SALES WAS $8.9 MILLION OF HURRICANE RECOVERY FILM SALES. HURRICANE RECOVERY FILM SALES IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION. THE DIVISION ALSO EXPERIENCED END-MARKET CHALLENGES DURING THE THREE- AND SIX-MONTH PERIOD IN THE GEOMEMBRANE MARKET AS WELL AS LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED CUSTOMER DEMAND IN THE INDUSTRIAL MARKET.  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN.  FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING  JULY 31, 2019  AND 2018, GROSS MARGIN WAS RELATIVELY FLAT AT  22.1%  AND  21.7%  , RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDING  JULY 31, 2019  AND 2018, GROSS MARGIN WAS  21.2%  AND  23.5%  , RESPECTIVELY. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER SALES VOLUME INCLUDING THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN HURRICANE RECOVERY FILM SALES AND CORRESPONDING NEGATIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE.  \u2022  OPERATING EXPENSES.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, OPERATING EXPENSES WERE  4.4%  IN THE CURRENT YEAR THREE-MONTH PERIOD AS COMPARED TO  3.3%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. YEAR-TO-DATE OPERATING EXPENSES WERE  4.9%  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES AS COMPARED TO  3.3%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER LEGAL EXPENSES IN BOTH THE THREE- AND SIX-MONTH PERIODS.

AEROSTAR\u2019S BUSINESS CONSISTS OF PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE AEROSPACE/DEFENSE AND COMMERCIAL LIGHTER-THAN-AIR MARKETS. THESE MARKETS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN DEMAND DUE TO GOVERNMENT SPENDING UNCERTAINTIES AND THE TIMING OF CONTRACT AWARDS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT GENERALLY MODEL COMPARATIVE MARKET SHARE POSITION FOR ITS DIVISIONS, BUT THE COMPANY BELIEVES AEROSTAR HAS MAINTAINED ITS MARKET SHARE IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020.  \u2022  S  ALES VOLUME.  NET SALES DECREASED  2.4%  FROM  $13.5 MILLION  FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2018, TO  $13.2 MILLION  FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2019. YEAR-TO-DATE SALES WERE  $25.4 MILLION  , UP  $1.0 MILLION  YEAR-OVER-YEAR, OR  3.9%  . PRIOR YEAR NET SALES FOR THE THREE- AND SIX-MONTH PERIODS INCLUDED AEROSTAT SALES OF $3.8 MILLION AND $4.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH AEROSTAT SALES WERE IMMATERIAL IN FISCAL 2020, THE DIVISION WAS ABLE TO DRIVE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN RADAR AND STRATOSPHERIC BALLOON SALES. AEROSTAT SALES VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR AS CUSTOMER DEMAND TENDS TO BE INHERENTLY INCONSISTENT. THE DIVISION'S AEROSTAT PRODUCT LINE IS VERY COMPETITIVE AND CAN GENERATE ABOVE DIVISION AVERAGE MARGINS. THE DIVISION WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPLY AEROSTATS AS DEMAND REQUIRES.  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN.  FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD, GROSS MARGIN DECREASED FROM  44.5%  TO  42.8%  DUE TO UNFAVORABLE SALES MIX. FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD, GROSS MARGIN INCREASED FOR THE CURRENT YEAR FROM  39.6%  TO  41.5%  DUE TO FAVORABLE SALES MIX.  \u2022  OPERATING EXPENSES.  SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2020 OPERATING EXPENSE WAS  $2.7 MILLION  , OR  20.5%  OF NET SALES, AN INCREASE FROM  16.2%  OF NET SALES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. YEAR-TO-DATE OPERATING EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS  22.0%  , UP FROM  12.4%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DIVISION INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 TO FOCUS ON ADVANCING ITS ENGINEERING SERVICES AND FLIGHT OPERATIONS CAPABILITIES AND TO SUPPORT A CONSISTENT CADENCE OF  #  26  FULFILLING FUTURE CONTRACTS. THE DIVISION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED ITS BALLOON LAUNCHES DURING THE THREE- AND SIX-MONTH PERIODS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019.

ADMINISTRATIVE SPENDING FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD OF FISCAL 2020 WAS DOWN  $3.4 MILLION  COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 AS PRIOR YEAR'S SPENDING INCLUDED AN EXPENSE OF $4.5 MILLION RELATED TO A GIFT TO SOUTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF ACTIVITY RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS OR LOSSES. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET FOR THE THREE- AND SIX-MONTH PERIODS IN FISCAL YEAR 2020. FISCAL 2019 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD INCLUDED A $5.8 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE COMPANY'S EQUITY INTEREST IN SST.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JULY 31,  2019 AND 2018, WERE  20.0%  AND  16.8%  , RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JULY 31,  2019 AND 2018, WERE  15.5%  AND  17.9%  , RESPECTIVELY. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE- AND SIX-MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF DISCRETE TAX ITEMS RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT AND VESTING OF EQUITY COMPENSATION AWARDS. REFER TO NOTE 13  INCOME TAXES  OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THESE IMPACTS TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  OUTLOOK  END-MARKET CONDITIONS IMPACTING OUR APPLIED TECHNOLOGY DIVISION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CHALLENGING THAN EXPECTED. BECAUSE OF THIS AND OTHER CHALLENGES EXPERIENCED IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, WE HAVE UPDATED OUR PREVIOUS EXPECTATIONS OF ACHIEVING YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN BOTH SALES AND DIVISION PROFIT FOR THE FULL-YEAR IN EACH DIVISION. THESE UPDATES ARE OUTLINED BY DIVISION BELOW.  APPLIED TECHNOLOGY EXPERIENCED CHALLENGING CONDITIONS IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 THAT WERE FAR WORSE THAN WE EXPECTED THREE MONTHS AGO. THESE MARKET CONDITIONS RESULTED IN A 10 PERCENT DECLINE IN SALES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER. AS WE BEGIN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, WE EXPECT OEM MACHINE PRODUCTION RATES TO IMPROVE RELATIVE TO THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, AND MARKET SHARE GAINS FROM NEW PRODUCT GROWTH, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION AND CONTINUED SUCCESS WITH RECENTLY-ACQUIRED AGSYNC TO HELP OFFSET THE CHALLENGING U.S. END-MARKET CONDITIONS. AT THIS TIME, WE EXPECT THE DIVISION\u2019S FISCAL 2020 SECOND HALF SALES AND DIVISION PROFIT TO EXCEED THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S SECOND HALF RESULTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE BELIEVE OUR STRONG OEM RELATIONSHIPS AND BEST-IN-CLASS TECHNOLOGY HAVE POSITIONED US FOR SIGNIFICANT GROWTH AND SUCCESS OVER THE LONG TERM.  ENGINEERED FILMS ALSO HAD END-MARKET CHALLENGES IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO WEAKNESS IN THE INDUSTRIAL AND GEOMEMBRANE MARKETS. IN ADDITION, THE DIVISION EXPERIENCED DIFFICULT YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISONS DUE TO PRIOR YEAR HURRICANE RECOVERY FILM SALES. HOWEVER, THE DIVISION IS WELL POSITIONED TO CAPITALIZE ON THE INVESTMENTS IT HAS MADE OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, AND WE EXPECT YEAR-OVER-YEAR SALES GROWTH IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR.  AEROSTAR CONTINUES TO ACHIEVE NEW MILESTONES AND LEAD THE INDUSTRY WITH ITS STRATOSPHERIC BALLOON CAPABILITIES. THE DIVISION SHOWED STRENGTH IN ITS CORE MARKETS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR AND INVESTED MORE AGGRESSIVELY IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO SUPPORT LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE DIVISION'S FUTURE AS IT CONTINUES TO INVEST IN BOTH ITS PRODUCT AND TECHNICAL SERVICE OFFERINGS.  WHILE THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED UNEXPECTED NEAR-TERM CHALLENGES IN THE SECOND QUARTER, THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE COMPANY REMAIN VERY STRONG AND WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITIONING IN EACH OF OUR OPERATING DIVISIONS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST  #  27  FOR THE LONG TERM THROUGH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO DRIVE NEW PRODUCT INNOVATION, CAPITAL EQUIPMENT TO IMPROVE AND AUGMENT OUR UNIQUE PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES, AND THE PURSUIT AND CLOSURE OF ADDITIONAL STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS.  WHILE WE WILL NOT ACHIEVE THE GROWTH IN SALES AND DIVISION PROFIT IN EVERY DIVISION THIS FISCAL YEAR AS WE PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED, WE DO EXPECT A STRONGER SECOND HALF SALES PERFORMANCE FOR EACH DIVISION, RELATIVE TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE FIRMLY BELIEVE WE ARE MUCH BETTER POSITIONED TODAY TO FACE END-MARKET CHALLENGES DUE TO THE INVESTMENT DISCIPLINE WE MAINTAINED DURING THE PREVIOUS END-MARKET CHALLENGES WE EXPERIENCED. OUR DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO CONTINUAL INVESTMENT IS SUPPORTED BY THE CONFIDENCE WE HAVE IN OUR ABILITY TO IMPROVE OUR MARKET-LEADING POSITIONS AND DRIVE LONG-TERM GROWTH.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY'S BALANCE SHEET CONTINUES TO REFLECT SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY AND A STRONG CAPITAL BASE. MANAGEMENT FOCUSES ON THE CURRENT CASH BALANCE AND OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN CONSIDERING LIQUIDITY, AS OPERATING CASH FLOWS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THAT CURRENT CASH, COMBINED WITH THE GENERATION OF POSITIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMPANY'S NORMAL OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES BEYOND THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS A CREDIT FACILITY OF UP TO $125.0 MILLION WITH A MATURITY DATE OF APRIL 15, 2020.  THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH BALANCES AND CASH FLOWS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  JULY 31,  2019  JANUARY 31,  2019  JULY 31,  2018  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $69,131  $65,787  $65,439  THREE MONTHS ENDED  SIX MONTHS ENDED  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  JULY 31, 2019  JULY 31, 2018  JULY 31, 2019  JULY 31, 2018  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $17,398  $25,049  $26,160  $38,652  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (1,237  )  (4,673  )  (3,678  )  (1,488  )  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (8,427  )  (6,082  )  (19,092  )  (11,857  )  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  27  (172  )  (46  )  (403  )  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $7,761  $14,122  $3,344  $24,904  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS TOTALED $69.1 MILLION  AT  JULY 31, 2019  , AN INCREASE OF  $3.3 MILLION  FROM $65.8 MILLION  AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE COMPARABLE BALANCE AS OF JULY 31, 2018 WAS $65.4 MILLION  . THE SEQUENTIAL INCREASE IN CASH WAS LED BY THE COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY FROM CASH RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS, WHICH WERE OFFSET BY CASH PAYMENTS FOR INVENTORIES, SERVICES, EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, AND INCOME TAXES. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $26.2 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED WITH  $38.7 MILLION  IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS YEAR-OVER-YEAR WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER NET INCOME AND AN INCREASE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  #  28  THE COMPANY'S CASH NEEDS HAVE MINIMAL SEASONAL TRENDS. AS A RESULT, THE DISCUSSION OF TRENDS IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOCUSES ON THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF YEAR-OVER-YEAR VARIABILITY IN NET WORKING CAPITAL. NET WORKING CAPITAL AND NET WORKING CAPITAL PERCENTAGE ARE METRICS USED BY MANAGEMENT AS A GUIDE IN MEASURING THE EFFICIENT USE OF CASH RESOURCES TO SUPPORT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND GROWTH. THE COMPANY'S NET WORKING CAPITAL FOR THE COMPARATIVE PERIODS WAS AS FOLLOWS.  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  JULY 31, 2019  JULY 31, 2018  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET  $60,700  $61,348  PLUS: INVENTORIES  61,311  55,993  LESS: ACCOUNTS PAYABLE  15,722  14,882  NET WORKING CAPITAL  (A)  $106,289  $102,459  ANNUALIZED NET SALES  (B)  392,232  410,736  NET WORKING CAPITAL PERCENTAGE  (C)  27.1%  24.9%  (A)  NET WORKING CAPITAL IS DEFINED AS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, (NET) PLUS INVENTORIES LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  (B)  ANNUALIZED NET SALES IS DEFINED AS THE MOST RECENT QUARTER NET SALES TIMES FOUR FOR EACH OF THE FISCAL PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY.  (C)  NET WORKING CAPITAL PERCENTAGE IS DEFINED AS NET WORKING CAPITAL DIVIDED BY ANNUALIZED NET SALES.  NET WORKING CAPITAL PERCENTAGE DETERIORATED  220  BASIS POINTS YEAR-OVER-YEAR IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THE INCREASE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL WAS LED BY AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY WITHIN ENGINEERED FILMS AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY. BOTH DIVISIONS EXPECTED HIGHER SALES DEMAND IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND PREPARED INVENTORY LEVELS TO MEET THOSE EXPECTATIONS.  INVENTORY LEVELS INCREASED  $5.3 MILLION  , OR  9.5%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR FROM  $56.0 MILLION  AT JULY 31, 2018, TO  $61.3 MILLION  AT JULY 31, 2019. IN COMPARISON, CONSOLIDATED NET SALES DECREASED  $4.6 MILLION  , OR  4.5%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR IN THE  SECOND QUARTER  . THE INCREASE IN INVENTORY WAS DRIVEN BY ENGINEERED FILMS AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY AS EACH DIVISION EXPECTED HIGHER SALES DEMAND IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND PREPARED INVENTORY LEVELS TO MEET THOSE EXPECTATIONS.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DECREASED  $0.6 MILLION  OR  1.1%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR TO  $60.7 MILLION  AT  JULY 31, 2019  , FROM  $61.3 MILLION  AT  JULY 31, 2018  . IN COMPARISON, CONSOLIDATED NET SALES DECREASED  $4.6 MILLION  , OR  4.5%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR IN THE  SECOND QUARTER  . LOWER SALES VOLUME AND THE TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE INCREASED  $0.8 MILLION  , OR  5.6%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR FROM  $14.9 MILLION  AT  JULY 31, 2018  , TO  $15.7 MILLION  AT  JULY 31, 2019  . THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO TIMING OF PURCHASES AND CASH PAYMENTS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $3.7 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED WITH CASH USED OF  $1.5 MILLION  IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE WAS CASH RECEIPTS OF $6.6 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN SST IN THE PRIOR YEAR. CAPITAL EXPENDITURE SPENDING WAS DOWN $3.1 MILLION COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR SIX-MONTH PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO PRIOR YEAR INVESTMENTS RELATED TO ENGINEERED FILMS' NEW EXTRUSION LINE (LINE 15).  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 WAS UP  $7.2 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE INCREASE IN CASH OUTFLOWS INCLUDED  $5.8 MILLION  OF SHARE REPURCHASES IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. THERE WERE NO SHARE REPURCHASES IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.  DIVIDENDS PER SHARE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND 2019 WERE CONSISTENT AT 26.0 CENTS PER SHARE. TOTAL CASH OUTFLOWS FOR DIVIDENDS IN THE SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JULY 31, 2019  , AND 2018, WERE  $9.4 MILLION  AND  $9.3 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  NO BORROWING OR REPAYMENT OCCURRED ON THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 OR FISCAL 2019.  OTHER LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT DATED APRIL 15, 2015. THIS AGREEMENT (CREDIT AGREEMENT), MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 10  FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS  OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q, PROVIDES FOR A SYNDICATED SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY UP TO $125 MILLION WITH A MATURITY DATE OF  APRIL 15, 2020  . THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FOR ANY OF THE FISCAL PERIODS COVERED BY THIS FORM 10-Q. AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FOR BORROWINGS AS OF  JULY 31, 2019  WAS  $124.7 MILLION  . THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ENTER INTO A NEW CREDIT FACILITY PRIOR TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT MATURING IN FISCAL 2021.  #  29  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS CUSTOMARY AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO FINANCIAL REPORTING AND NOTIFICATION, LIMITS ON LEVELS OF INDEBTEDNESS AND LIENS, INVESTMENTS, MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS, SALES OF ASSETS, RESTRICTIVE AGREEMENTS, AND CHANGE IN CONTROL AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.

ANY DRAWS REQUIRED UNDER THE LOCS WOULD BE SETTLED WITH AVAILABLE CASH OR BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S KNOWN OFF-BALANCE SHEET DEBT AND OTHER UNRECORDED OBLIGATIONS SINCE THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, OTHER THAN ITEM DISCUSSED BELOW.

CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES  THE  PREPARATION OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED REVENUES  AND EXPENSES DURING THE RESPECTIVE REPORTING PERIODS. SOME OF THE ESTIMATES NEEDED TO BE MADE BY MANAGEMENT INCLUDE THE ALLOWANCE  FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, PROMOTIONAL AND RETURNS ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY RESERVES, THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT,  AND THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.

THE IRR CALCULATION FOR THE RETIREMENT PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES OF BRIDGFORD  FOODS CORPORATION IS MEASURED ANNUALLY AND BASED ON THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT RATE. THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT RATE AS  OF JULY 31, 2019 WAS 3.44% AS COMPARED TO 4.30% AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2018. THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE  VALUE OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AS WELL AS THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST.  OUR  CREDIT RISK IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF CUSTOMERS AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. LOSSES DUE TO CREDIT RISK HAVE RECENTLY BEEN  IMMATERIAL. THE PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IS BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS AND CURRENT COLLECTION RISK. WE HAVE  SIGNIFICANT RECEIVABLES WITH A FEW LARGE, WELL KNOWN CUSTOMERS WHICH, ALTHOUGH HISTORICALLY SECURE, COULD BE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL  RISK SHOULD THESE CUSTOMERS\u2019 OPERATIONS SUDDENLY DETERIORATE. WE MONITOR THESE CUSTOMERS CLOSELY TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF  LOSS.  THE  TABLE BELOW SHOWS CUSTOMERS THAT ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 20% OF CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (\u201cAR\u201d) OR 10% OF  CONSOLIDATED SALES FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED JULY 12, 2019 AND JULY 13, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.

SALES  ARE RECOGNIZED UPON PASSAGE OF TITLE TO THE CUSTOMER, TYPICALLY UPON PRODUCT PICK-UP, SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY TO CUSTOMERS. PRODUCTS  ARE DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR OWN LONG-HAUL FLEET OR THROUGH OUR OWN DIRECT STORE DELIVERY SYSTEM.  12  OF 24  WE  RECORD THE CASH SURRENDER OR CONTRACT VALUE FOR LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES AS AN ADJUSTMENT OF PREMIUMS PAID IN DETERMINING THE EXPENSE  OR INCOME TO BE RECOGNIZED UNDER THE CONTRACT FOR THE PERIOD.  WE  PROVIDE TAX RESERVES FOR FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSURES RELATING TO AUDIT RESULTS, TAX PLANNING INITIATIVES  AND COMPLIANCE RESPONSIBILITIES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE RESERVES REQUIRES JUDGMENTS ABOUT TAX ISSUES, POTENTIAL OUTCOMES AND  TIMING, AND IS A SUBJECTIVE ESTIMATE. ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME OF THESE TAX AUDITS IS UNCERTAIN, IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S OPINION ADEQUATE  PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN MADE FOR POTENTIAL LIABILITIES, IF ANY, RESULTING FROM THESE REVIEWS. ACTUAL OUTCOMES MAY  DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  WE  ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OR WHENEVER ADVERSE EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES  OR BUSINESS CLIMATE INDICATE THAT EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO SUCH LONG-LIVED ASSETS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT  TO SUPPORT THE NET BOOK VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS. IF UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE RECORDED ASSETS, WE  RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE APPLICABLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.  WE  PARTICIPATE IN \u201cMULTIEMPLOYER\u201d PENSION PLANS ADMINISTERED BY LABOR UNIONS ON BEHALF OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. WE PAY MONTHLY  CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNION TRUST FUNDS, A PORTION OF WHICH IS USED TO FUND PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. THE CONTRIBUTION  AMOUNT MAY CHANGE DEPENDING UPON THE ABILITY OF PARTICIPATING COMPANIES TO FUND THESE PENSION LIABILITIES AS WELL AS THE ACTUAL  AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS. SHOULD WE WITHDRAW FROM THE UNION AND CEASE PARTICIPATION IN A UNION PLAN, FEDERAL  LAW COULD IMPOSE A PENALTY FOR ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN. THE PENALTY WOULD BE RECORDED AS AN EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED  STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF THE WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY IS DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE FUNDED  STATUS OF THE PLAN AND CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY OTHER PARTICIPATING COMPANIES.  IN  MARCH 2010, THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AS AMENDED BY THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT (COLLECTIVELY,  THE \u201cPPACA\u201d), WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW INCLUDE THE REMOVAL OF THE LIFETIME LIMITS ON ACTIVE AND  RETIREE MEDICAL COVERAGE, EXPANDING DEPENDENT COVERAGE TO AGE 26 AND THE ELIMINATION OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT MAY IMPACT  OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS COSTS. IN ADDITION, THE PPACA INCLUDES POTENTIAL EXCISE TAX ON THE VALUE OF BENEFITS THAT EXCEED  A PRE-DEFINED LIMIT WHICH MAY REQUIRE CHANGES IN BENEFIT PLAN LEVELS IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THIS ADDITIONAL COST. FINALLY, THE PPACA  INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO OFFER HEALTH BENEFITS TO ALL FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES (DEFINED AS 30 HOURS PER WEEK).  THE HEALTH COVERAGE MUST MEET MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE ACTUARIAL VALUE OF THE BENEFITS OFFERED AND EMPLOYEE AFFORDABILITY. BOTH  THE ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS HAVE MADE RECENT ATTEMPTS TO REPLACE THE PPACA WITH AN ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT  ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE RULES THAT COMPEL AN EMPLOYER SUCH AS BRIDGFORD FOODS TO OFFER AFFORDABLE COVERAGE TO ALL  OF ITS EMPLOYEES. THE RECENT TAX LAW CHANGES REMOVED THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PROVISION THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE PPACA AND REQUIRES  ALL INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE OR PAY A PENALTY. DESPITE THIS CHANGE, THE RECENT TAX CHANGES DID NOT ADJUST OR REMOVE  THE EMPLOYER MANDATE. WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE FURTHER CHANGES AT THIS POINT IN TIME. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT PLANS MEET THE EXISTING  REQUIREMENTS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS OF THE PPACA AND ITS IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS MORE LEGISLATIVE AND INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE BECOMES AVAILABLE. THE POTENTIAL FUTURE EFFECTS AND COST OF  COMPLYING WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE PPACA ARE NOT DETERMINABLE AT THIS TIME  OVERVIEW  OF REPORTING SEGMENTS  WE  OPERATE IN TWO BUSINESS SEGMENTS \u2013 THE PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION OF FROZEN FOOD PRODUCTS (THE FROZEN FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT),  AND THE PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION OF SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS (THE SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT).

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 REFLECTS IMPACTS  OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT SIGNED INTO LAW ON DECEMBER 22, 2017. THESE IMPACTS INCLUDE A $3,200 EXPENSE RELATED TO THE REMEASUREMENT  OF DEFERRED TAXES, AS WELL AS A BLENDED 23.07% STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2018 COMPARED TO THE 35% STATUTORY  FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE EFFECTIVE FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. THE RATE ALSO REFLECTS IMPACT OF $1,640 MILLION OF EXPENSE RELATED TO TAX  ON THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF A LAND PARCEL IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 PART I, ITEM 1(E), - INCOME TAXES OF THE NOTES  TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE ALSO DIFFERED FROM THE APPLICABLE  MIXED STATUTORY RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 27.55% DUE TO NON- TAXABLE GAINS AND LOSSES ON LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES AND DOMESTIC PRODUCTION  ACTIVITIES DEDUCTIONS UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 199.  NET  INCOME CONSOLIDATED  THE  NET INCOME OF $5,201 IN THE THIRTY-SIX-WEEKS PERIOD ENDED JULY 12, 2019 INCLUDES A NON-TAXABLE GAIN ON LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES  IN THE AMOUNT OF $714. THE NET INCOME OF $4,455 IN THE THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD ENDED JULY 13, 2018 INCLUDES A NON-RECURRING GAIN  ON THE SALE OF REAL PROPERTY FOR $5,977 (BEFORE TAXES) AND A NON-TAXABLE GAIN ON LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,088.  GAINS AND LOSSES ON LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING EQUITIES THAT SUPPORT POLICY  VALUES AND FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY.  18  OF 24  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE  PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF OUR OPERATING CASH FLOW IS CASH RECEIPTS FROM THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS, NET OF COSTS TO MANUFACTURE, STORE,  MARKET AND DELIVER SUCH PRODUCTS. WE HAVE REMAINED FREE OF INTEREST-BEARING DEBT (EXCLUDING CAPITAL LEASES AND EQUIPMENT FINANCING)  FOR TWENTY-NINE OF THE LAST THIRTY YEARS (WITH FISCAL YEARS 2014 AND 2019 BEING THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS) AND WE NORMALLY FUND  OUR OPERATIONS FROM CASH BALANCES AND CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. WE BORROWED $7,500 DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR 2019 TO PURCHASE SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT FOR OUR NEW CHICAGO PROCESSING FACILITY. WE BORROWED A SECOND $7,500 SUBSEQUENT TO THE  END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019. HISTORICALLY, WE EXPECT POSITIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF OUR  FISCAL YEAR FROM THE LIQUIDATION OF INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES RELATED TO HOLIDAY SEASON SALES. ANTICIPATED COMMODITY  PRICE TRENDS MAY AFFECT FUTURE CASH BALANCES. CERTAIN COMMODITIES MAY BE PURCHASED IN ADVANCE OF OUR IMMEDIATE NEEDS TO LOWER  THE ULTIMATE COST OF PROCESSING.

UNDER THE STOCK  REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE ARE AUTHORIZED, AT THE DISCRETION OF MANAGEMENT AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, TO PURCHASE UP TO AN AGGREGATE  OF 2,000,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE OPEN MARKET. AS OF JULY 12, 2019, 120,113 SHARES WERE AUTHORIZED FOR REPURCHASE  UNDER THE PROGRAM.  ON  DECEMBER 26, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A MASTER COLLATERAL LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A FOR UP TO $15,000  IN EQUIPMENT FINANCING. PURSUANT TO THE LOAN AGREEMENT, WE BORROWED $15,000, TWO SEPARATE RECEIPTS OF $7,500 EACH, TO PURCHASE  SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT FOR OUR NEW CHICAGO PROCESSING FACILITY AT A FIXED RATE OF 4.13% AND 3.98%, RESPECTIVELY, PER ANNUM. THE LOAN  TERMS ARE SEVEN YEARS AND ARE SECURED BY THE PURCHASED EQUIPMENT. THE FIRST FUNDING OF $7,500 WAS RECEIVED ON DECEMBER 28, 2018.  THE SECOND FUNDING WAS RECEIVED ON APRIL 23, 2019. THE MASTER COLLATERAL LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A.  CONTAINS VARIOUS AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS THAT LIMIT THE USE OF FUNDS AND DEFINE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE LOAN. THE MAIN  FINANCIAL COVENANTS ARE LISTED BELOW.  \u25cf  TOTAL  LIABILITIES DIVIDED BY TANGIBLE NET WORTH NOT GREATER THAN 2.5 TO 1.0 AT EACH FISCAL QUARTER,  \u25cf  QUICK  RATIO NOT LESS THAN 1.0 TO 1.0 AT EACH FISCAL QUARTER END, AND  \u25cf  NET  INCOME AFTER TAXES NOT LESS THAN ONE DOLLAR ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, DETERMINED AS OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER END.  THE  COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE MASTER COLLATERAL LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT AS OF JULY 12, 2019.  THE  IMPACT OF INFLATION ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAS NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT. MANAGEMENT IS  OF THE OPINION THAT THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL POSITION AND ITS CAPITAL RESOURCES ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE FOR ITS OPERATING  NEEDS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  20  OF 24  RECENT  ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN  MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT CHANGES THE CRITERIA FOR RECOGNIZING REVENUE. THE GUIDANCE PROVIDES FOR A SINGLE FIVE-STEP  MODEL TO BE APPLIED TO ALL REVENUE CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE STANDARD ALSO REQUIRES ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCLOSURES  THAT WILL ENABLE USERS TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS RELATING TO CUSTOMER  CONTRACTS, INCLUDING DISAGGREGATED REVENUE DISCLOSURES. COMPANIES HAVE AN OPTION TO USE EITHER A RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH OR CUMULATIVE  EFFECT ADJUSTMENT APPROACH TO IMPLEMENT THE STANDARD.

NET SALES FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  1.2%  TO  $30.8 BILLION  FROM  $30.5 BILLION  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE IN NET SALES IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET AND COMPARABLE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS. ONLINE SALES, WHICH CONSIST OF SALES GENERATED ONLINE THROUGH OUR WEBSITES FOR PRODUCTS PICKED UP IN OUR STORES OR DELIVERED TO CUSTOMER LOCATIONS, REPRESENTED  8.9%  OF NET SALES AND GREW  20.1%  DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SALES GROWTH BY  $29 MILLION  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  COMPARABLE SALES  . COMPARABLE SALES IS A MEASURE THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR EXISTING LOCATIONS AND WEBSITES BY MEASURING THE CHANGE IN NET SALES FOR A PERIOD OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-PERIOD OF EQUIVALENT LENGTH. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDES SALES AT ALL LOCATIONS, PHYSICAL AND ONLINE, OPEN GREATER THAN 52 WEEKS (INCLUDING REMODELS AND RELOCATIONS) AND EXCLUDING CLOSED STORES. RETAIL STORES BECOME COMPARABLE ON THE MONDAY FOLLOWING THEIR 365  TH  DAY OF OPERATION. ACQUISITIONS, DIGITAL OR OTHERWISE, ARE INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE SALES AFTER WE OWN THE ACQUIRED ASSETS FOR MORE THAN 52 WEEKS. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDES NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERING SALES THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED FOR MORE THAN 52 WEEKS. COMPARABLE SALES EXCLUDES PRIOR-YEAR SALES OF PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS THAT WE HAVE EXITED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. FISCAL 2019 INCLUDES 52 WEEKS AND FISCAL 2018 INCLUDED 53  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WEEKS. FOR OUR CALCULATION OF COMPARABLE SALES IN FISCAL 2019, WE WILL COMPARE WEEKS 1 THROUGH 52 IN FISCAL 2019 AGAINST WEEKS 2 THROUGH 53 IN FISCAL 2018. COMPARABLE SALES IS INTENDED ONLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET SALES PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES  INCREASED  3.0%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , CONSISTING OF A  2.0%  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET AND A  1.0%  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS. THE  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE SALES REFLECTED A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXECUTION OF OUR STRATEGIC EFFORTS TO DRIVE AN ENHANCED INTERCONNECTED EXPERIENCE IN BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL WORLDS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COMPARABLE SALES GROWTH AND TOTAL SALES GROWTH IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SHIFT IN OUR FISCAL CALENDAR AS A RESULT OF THE 53  RD  WEEK IN FISCAL 2018.  ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS POSTED POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  EXCEPT FOR  LUMBER  , WHICH WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY COMMODITY PRICE DEFLATION. WE EXPECT LUMBER PRICES TO REMAIN DEPRESSED IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2019.

WE ALSO INTEND TO USE OUR BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS TO IDENTIFY SELL-THROUGH RATES BY PRODUCT, CAPITALIZE ON STRONG PERFORMING CATEGORIES, IDENTIFY AND BUY INTO NEW FASHION TRENDS AND OPPORTUNISTICALLY ACQUIRE PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE.  \u2022  SHARPENING FOCUS ON OUR CORE FEMALE CUSTOMER.  WE HAVE FOCUSED ON BETTER SERVING OUR CORE FEMALE CUSTOMER, A BRAND-CONSCIOUS FASHION ENTHUSIAST, AGED 25-49, WITH AN AVERAGE ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $25,000-$100,000, BY IMPROVING OUR PRODUCT OFFERING, STORE MERCHANDISING AND MARKETING FOCUS ON WOMEN\u2019S READY-TO-WEAR APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES TO CAPTURE INCREMENTAL SALES FROM OUR CORE FEMALE CUSTOMER AND BECOME A DESTINATION FOR HER ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE EFFORTS WILL INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF HER VISITS AND HER AVERAGE SPEND, FURTHER IMPROVING THE COMPARABLE STORE SALES PERFORMANCE IN WOMEN\u2019S CATEGORIES.  \u2022  CONTINUING TO IMPROVE OUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.  WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED THE STORE EXPERIENCE AND EASE OF SHOPPING AT ALL OF OUR STORES BY IMPLEMENTING A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM FOCUSED ON OFFERING MORE BRANDS AND STYLES AND SIMPLIFYING STORE NAVIGATION. WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THIS BY UTILIZING CLEAR WAY-FINDING SIGNS AND DISTINCT PRODUCT SIGNAGE, HIGHLIGHTING KEY BRANDS AND NEW ARRIVALS, IMPROVING ORGANIZATION OF THE FLOOR SPACE, REDUCING RACK DENSITY, FACILITATING QUICKER CHECKOUTS AND DELIVERING BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE HAVE MADE PARTICULAR IMPROVEMENTS IN PRODUCT SIZE VISIBILITY, QUEUING AND FITTING ROOMS. TO ENSURE CONSISTENT EXECUTION OF OUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE PRIORITIES, WE HAVE IMPROVED OUR STORE ASSOCIATE TRAINING AND REORGANIZED AND STRENGTHENED OUR FIELD MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION. OUR MUCH IMPROVED STORE EXPERIENCE CONTINUES TO RESONATE WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. WE CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR ONLINE CUSTOMER SURVEY TO PROVIDE MORE ACTIONABLE CUSTOMER FEEDBACK TO STORES. STORES DEVELOP ACTION PLANS TO ADDRESS CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AREAS OF FOCUS. STORE MANAGERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO REVIEW IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS, AND REACT ACCORDINGLY.  \u2022  INCREASING OUR SALES THROUGH E-COMMERCE.  WE HAVE BEEN SELLING TO OUR CUSTOMERS ONLINE FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. WE PLAN TO LEVERAGE THIS HERITAGE AND CONTINUE TO UTILIZE E-COMMERCE STRATEGIES OFFERING MERCHANDISE TO OUR CUSTOMERS WHILE DRIVING INCREMENTAL TRAFFIC TO OUR STORES.  \u2022  ENHANCING EXISTING CATEGORIES AND INTRODUCING NEW CATEGORIES.  WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF CERTAIN EXISTING CATEGORIES SUCH AS LADIES\u2019 APPAREL, CHILDREN\u2019S PRODUCTS, BATH AND COSMETIC MERCHANDISE, HOUSEWARES, DE\u0301COR FOR THE HOME AND BEAUTY AS WE CONTINUE TO DE-WEATHER OUR BUSINESS, AND MAINTAIN THE FLEXIBILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW CATEGORIES.  22  \u2022  PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD.  WE HAVE PILOTED A NEW PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN ROLLED OUT TO  ALL OUR STORES IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES  , WITH PLANS TO BRING THE PROGRAM TO  OUR PUERTO RICO  STORES  AND OUR E-COMMERCE SITE  . WE BELIEVE THIS PROGRAM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DEEPEN CUSTOMER LOYALTY, INFORM CUSTOMER CONTACT STRATEGIES, AND DRIVE INCREASES IN TRIP FREQUENCY AND TRANSACTION SIZE.  \u2022  EXPANDING AND ENHANCING OUR RETAIL STORE BASE.  WE INTEND TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE OUR RETAIL STORE BASE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES.  \u2022  ADHERING TO A MARKET FOCUSED AND FINANCIALLY DISCIPLINED REAL ESTATE STRATEGY.  WE HAVE GROWN OUR STORE BASE CONSISTENTLY SINCE OUR FOUNDING IN 1972, DEVELOPING MORE THAN 99% OF OUR STORES ORGANICALLY. WE BELIEVE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND OUR RETAIL STORE BASE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS MARKET OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ALLOW US TO REACH 1,000 STORES OVER THE LONG-TERM. OUR GOAL IS TO OPEN APPROXIMATELY 50 NET NEW STORES DURING FISCAL 2019.  \u2022  MAINTAINING FOCUS ON UNIT ECONOMICS AND RETURNS.  WE HAVE ADOPTED A MARKET FOCUSED APPROACH TO NEW STORE OPENINGS WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON MAXIMIZING SALES WHILE ACHIEVING ATTRACTIVE UNIT ECONOMICS AND RETURNS. BY FOCUSING ON OPENING STORES WITH ATTRACTIVE UNIT ECONOMICS, WE ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE ATTRACTIVE RETURNS ON CAPITAL AND CONTINUE TO GROW OUR MARGINS. WE BELIEVE THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO REDUCE OUR COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY, WE WILL BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF OUR STORES WHILE CONTINUING TO MAINTAIN OUR BROAD ASSORTMENT.  \u2022  ENHANCING THE STORE EXPERIENCE THROUGH STORE REMODELS AND RELOCATIONS.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN STORE REMODELS ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS WHERE APPROPRIATE, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE AGE, SALES AND PROFITABILITY OF A STORE, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT TO THE CUSTOMER SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. IN OUR REMODELED STORES, WE HAVE TYPICALLY INCORPORATED NEW FLOORING, PAINTING, LIGHTING AND GRAPHICS, RELOCATED OUR FITTING ROOMS TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTIVE SELLING SPACE, ADDED NEW DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS HOME AND ACCESSORIES AND MADE VARIOUS OTHER IMPROVEMENTS AS APPROPRIATE BY LOCATION.  \u2022  ENHANCING OPERATING MARGINS.  WE INTEND TO INCREASE OUR OPERATING MARGINS THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES.  \u2022  OPTIMIZE MARKDOWNS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MARKDOWN SYSTEM ALLOWS US TO MAXIMIZE SALES AND GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS BASED ON FORWARD-LOOKING SALES FORECASTS, SELL-THROUGH TARGETS, AND EXIT DATES. THIS ALLOWS US TO OPTIMIZE MARKDOWNS AT THE STYLE AND COLOR LEVEL BY STORE CLUSTER.  \u2022  ENHANCE PURCHASING POWER.  WE BELIEVE THAT INCREASING OUR STORE FOOTPRINT AND EXPANDING OUR WEST COAST BUYING OFFICE PROVIDES US WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO CAPTURE INCREMENTAL BUYING OPPORTUNITIES AND REALIZE ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN OUR MERCHANDISING AND NON-MERCHANDISING PURCHASING ACTIVITIES.  \u2022  DRIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE OUR GROWING SALES OVER THE FIXED COSTS OF OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR CORPORATE AND IN-STORE OPERATIONS.  UNCERTAINTIES AND CHALLENGES  AS WE STRIVE TO INCREASE PROFITABILITY THROUGH ACHIEVING POSITIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES AND LEVERAGING PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE IN-STORE EXPERIENCE, MORE EFFICIENT MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTS FROM THE VENDORS TO THE SELLING FLOORS, AND MODIFYING OUR MARKETING PLANS TO INCREASE OUR CORE CUSTOMER BASE AND INCREASE OUR SHARE OF OUR CURRENT CUSTOMERS\u2019 SPENDING, THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES AND CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AS AN OFF-PRICE RETAILER OF APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES FOR MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND HOME FURNISHINGS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES OR INCOME.  SEASONALITY OF SALES AND WEATHER CONDITIONS  . OUR SALES, LIKE MOST OTHER RETAILERS, ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL INFLUENCES, WITH THE MAJORITY OF OUR SALES AND NET INCOME DERIVED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, WHICH INCLUDES THE BACK-TO-SCHOOL AND HOLIDAY SEASONS.  WEATHER CONTINUES TO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE SALE OF OUR CLOTHING. GENERALLY, OUR SALES ARE HIGHER IF THE WEATHER IS COLD DURING THE FALL AND WARM DURING THE EARLY SPRING. SALES OF COLD WEATHER CLOTHING ARE INCREASED BY EARLY COLD WEATHER DURING THE FALL, WHILE SALES OF WARM WEATHER CLOTHING ARE IMPROVED BY EARLY WARM WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE SPRING. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DIVERSIFIED OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WE BELIEVE TRAFFIC TO OUR STORES IS STILL DRIVEN, IN PART, BY WEATHER PATTERNS.  GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS, INCLUDING SPENDING FOR THE MERCHANDISE THAT WE SELL, ARE AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PREVAILING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INFLATION, LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT, SALARIES AND WAGE RATES, PREVAILING  23  INTEREST RATES, HOUSING COSTS, ENERGY COSTS, COMMODITIES PRICING, INCOME TAX RATES AND POLICIES, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND CONSUMER PERCEPTION OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, CONSUMER PURCHASING PATTERNS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY CONSUMERS\u2019 DISPOSABLE INCOME, CREDIT AVAILABILITY AND DEBT LEVELS.  A SLOWDOWN IN THE U.S. ECONOMY, AN UNCERTAIN GLOBAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK OR A CREDIT CRISIS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS RESULTING IN LOWER NET SALES AND PROFITS THAN EXPECTED ON A QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL BASIS. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SITUATION. OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN AREAS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TAXES AND HEALTHCARE. ONGOING INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS COULD HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR INCOME AND AN INDIRECT IMPACT ON CONSUMER PRICES. THE OUTBREAK OR ESCALATION OF WAR, OR THE OCCURRENCE OF TERRORIST ACTS OR OTHER HOSTILITIES IN OR AFFECTING THE U.S., COULD LEAD TO A DECREASE IN SPENDING BY CONSUMERS. IN ADDITION, NATURAL DISASTERS, INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AND ACTS OF WAR IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DISRUPTING SUPPLIES AND RAISING PRICES GLOBALLY WHICH, IN TURN, MAY HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE WORLD AND U.S. ECONOMIES AND LEAD TO A DOWNTURN IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND SPENDING.  WE CLOSELY MONITOR OUR NET SALES, GROSS MARGIN AND EXPENSES. WE HAVE PERFORMED SCENARIO PLANNING SUCH THAT IF OUR NET SALES DECLINE, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED VARIABLE COSTS THAT COULD BE REDUCED TO PARTIALLY MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THESE DECLINES. IF WE WERE TO EXPERIENCE ADVERSE ECONOMIC TRENDS AND/OR IF OUR EFFORTS TO COUNTERACT THE IMPACTS OF THESE TRENDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVE, THERE COULD BE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND POSITION IN FUTURE FISCAL PERIODS.  COMPETITION AND MARGIN PRESSURE.  WE BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, WE MUST CONTINUE TO OFFER BRAND-NAME MERCHANDISE AT A DISCOUNT TO PRICES OFFERED BY OTHER RETAILERS AS WELL AS AN ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE THAT IS APPEALING TO OUR CUSTOMERS.  THE U.S. RETAIL APPAREL AND HOME FURNISHINGS MARKETS ARE HIGHLY FRAGMENTED AND COMPETITIVE. WE COMPETE FOR BUSINESS WITH DEPARTMENT STORES, OFF-PRICE RETAILERS, INTERNET RETAILERS, SPECIALTY STORES, DISCOUNT STORES, WHOLESALE CLUBS, AND OUTLET STORES AS WELL AS WITH C  ERTAIN TRADITIONAL, FULL-PRICE RETAIL CHAINS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED OFF-PRICE CONCEPTS  . AT VARIOUS TIMES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, TRADITIONAL FULL-PRICE DEPARTMENT STORE CHAINS AND SPECIALTY SHOPS OFFER BRAND-NAME MERCHANDISE AT SUBSTANTIAL MARKDOWNS, WHICH CAN RESULT IN PRICES APPROXIMATING THOSE OFFERED BY US AT OUR BURLINGTON STORES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT COMPETITION WILL INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. THEREFORE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO DIFFERENTIATE OUR STORES FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS.  THE U.S. RETAIL INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO FACE INCREASED PRESSURE ON MARGINS AS OVERALL CHALLENGING RETAIL CONDITIONS HAVE LED CONSUMERS TO BE MORE VALUE CONSCIOUS. OUR \u201cOPEN TO BUY\u201d PARADIGM, UNDER WHICH WE PURCHASE BOTH PRE-SEASON AND IN-SEASON MERCHANDISE, ALLOWS US THE FLEXIBILITY TO PURCHASE LESS PRE-SEASON WITH THE BALANCE PURCHASED IN-SEASON AND OPPORTUNISTICALLY. IT ALSO PROVIDES US WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO SHIFT PURCHASES BETWEEN SUPPLIERS AND CATEGORIES. THIS ENABLES US TO OBTAIN BETTER TERMS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, WHICH WE EXPECT TO HELP OFFSET ANY RISING COSTS OF GOODS.  KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES  WE CONSIDER NUMEROUS FACTORS IN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE. KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES USED BY MANAGEMENT INCLUDE NET INCOME, ADJUSTED NET INCOME, ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBIT, COMPARABLE STORE SALES, GROSS MARGIN, INVENTORY, STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES AND LIQUIDITY.  NET INCOME  . WE EARNED NET INCOME OF $84.6 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH $71.0 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018. WE EARNED NET INCOME OF $162.3 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH $153.5 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR INCREASED GROSS MARGIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. REFER TO THE SECTION BELOW ENTITLED \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION.  ADJUSTED NET INCOME, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBIT  : ADJUSTED NET INCOME, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBIT ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES OF OUR PERFORMANCE.  WE DEFINE ADJUSTED NET INCOME AS NET INCOME, EXCLUSIVE OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, IF APPLICABLE: (I) NET FAVORABLE LEASE COST; (II) COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS; (III) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; (IV) IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; AND (V) OTHER UNUSUAL, NON-RECURRING OR EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES, LOSSES, CHARGES OR GAINS, ALL OF WHICH ARE TAX EFFECTED TO ARRIVE AT ADJUSTED NET INCOME.  WE DEFINE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS NET INCOME, EXCLUSIVE OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, IF APPLICABLE: (I) INTEREST EXPENSE; (II) INTEREST INCOME; (III) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; (IV) INCOME TAX EXPENSE; (V) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION; (VI) IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; (VII) COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS; AND (VIII) OTHER UNUSUAL, NON-RECURRING OR EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES, LOSSES, CHARGES OR GAINS.  24  WE DEFINE  ADJUSTED EBIT  AS NET INCOME, EXCLUSIVE OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, IF APPLICABLE: (I) INTEREST EXPENSE; (II) INTEREST INCOME; (III) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; (IV) INCOME TAX EXPENSE; (V) IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; (VI) NET FAVORABLE LEASE COST  S  ; (VII) COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS; AND (VIII) OTHER UNUSUAL, NON-RECURRING OR EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES, LOSSES, CHARGES OR GAINS.  WE PRESENT ADJUSTED NET INCOME, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBIT, BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY ARE USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES IN EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS AND PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY INTO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMS THAT MAY VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN FREQUENCY AND MAGNITUDE FROM WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE OUR CORE OPERATING RESULTS ARE USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES THAT ASSIST IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE EARNINGS AND LEVERAGE SALES, AND TO MORE READILY COMPARE CORE OPERATING RESULTS BETWEEN PAST AND FUTURE PERIODS.  ADJUSTED NET INCOME HAS LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED EITHER IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR OTHER DATA PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. AMONG OTHER LIMITATIONS, ADJUSTED NET INCOME DOES NOT REFLECT THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, NET OF THEIR TAX EFFECT.  \u2022  FAVORABLE LEASE COSTS;  \u2022  COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS;  \u2022  LOSSES ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT;  \u2022  IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON LONG-LIVED ASSETS; AND  \u2022  OTHER UNUSUAL, NON-RECURRING OR EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES, LOSSES, CHARGES OR GAINS.  DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, ADJUSTED NET INCOME IMPROVED $12.6 MILLION TO $91.4 MILLION AND $11.1 MILLION TO $176.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. REFER TO THE SECTION BELOW ENTITLED \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS OUR RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO ADJUSTED NET INCOME FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018.

THESE EXPENSES ARE RECORDED IN THE LINE ITEM \u201cDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\u201d IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018.  COMPARABLE STORE SALES.  COMPARABLE STORE SALES MEASURE PERFORMANCE OF A STORE DURING THE CURRENT REPORTING PERIOD AGAINST THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SAME STORE IN THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THE METHOD OF CALCULATING COMPARABLE STORE SALES VARIES ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, OUR DEFINITION OF COMPARABLE STORE SALES MAY DIFFER FROM OTHER RETAILERS.  WE DEFINE COMPARABLE STORE SALES AS MERCHANDISE SALES OF THOSE STORES, INCLUDING OUR ONLINE STORE, COMMENCING ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FISCAL MONTH ONE YEAR AFTER THE END OF THEIR GRAND OPENING ACTIVITIES, WHICH NORMALLY CONCLUDE WITHIN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF OPERATIONS. IF A STORE IS CLOSED FOR SEVEN OR MORE DAYS DURING A MONTH, OUR POLICY IS TO REMOVE THAT STORE FROM OUR CALCULATION OF COMPARABLE STORES SALES FOR ANY SUCH MONTH, AS WELL AS DURING THE MONTH(S) OF THEIR GRAND RE-OPENING ACTIVITIES. THE INCREASE IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES WAS AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  SIX MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  3.8%  1.9%  AUGUST 4, 2018  2.9%  3.8%  VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECT COMPARABLE STORE SALES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WEATHER CONDITIONS, CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE TIMING OF OUR RELEASES OF NEW MERCHANDISE AND PROMOTIONAL EVENTS, THE GENERAL RETAIL SALES ENVIRONMENT, CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND BUYING TRENDS, CHANGES IN SALES MIX AMONG DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, COMPETITION, AND THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING PROGRAMS.  GROSS MARGIN.  GROSS MARGIN IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NET SALES AND THE COST OF SALES. OUR COST OF SALES AND GROSS MARGIN MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF OTHER ENTITIES, SINCE SOME ENTITIES MAY INCLUDE ALL OF THE COSTS RELATED TO THEIR BUYING AND DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS, CERTAIN STORE-RELATED COSTS AND OTHER COSTS, IN COST OF SALES. WE INCLUDE CERTAIN OF THESE COSTS IN THE LINE ITEMS \u201cSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\u201d AND \u201cDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\u201d IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. WE INCLUDE IN OUR \u201cCOST OF SALES\u201d LINE ITEM ALL COSTS OF MERCHANDISE (NET OF PURCHASE DISCOUNTS AND CERTAIN VENDOR ALLOWANCES), INBOUND FREIGHT, DISTRIBUTION CENTER OUTBOUND FREIGHT AND CERTAIN MERCHANDISE ACQUISITION COSTS, PRIMARILY COMMISSIONS AND IMPORT FEES. GROSS  27  MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  REMAINED CONSISTENT AT  41.4%  DURING THE  THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018.  I  NCREASED MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS  . PRODUCT SOURCING COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES,  IMPROVED APPROXIMATELY 10 BASIS POINTS  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES DECREASED APPROXIMATELY  10  BASIS POINTS TO  41.2%  DURING  THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  , DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  INCREASED MERCHANDISE MARGIN  . PRODUCT SOURCING COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES,  REMAINED FLAT  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  INVENTORY.  INVENTORY AT AUGUST 3, 2019 DECREASED TO $823.8 MILLION COMPARED WITH $843.9 MILLION AT AUGUST 4, 2018. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN APPROXIMATELY 7% DECREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN SHORT STAY INVENTORY. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR 40 NET NEW STORES OPENED FROM AUGUST 4, 2018 THROUGH AUGUST 3, 2019 AND OUR PACK-AND-HOLD INVENTORY LEVELS, WHICH WERE 29% OF TOTAL INVENTORY AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO 26% AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  INVENTORY AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019 WAS $954.2 MILLION. THE DECREASE IN INVENTORY IS PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR HIGH STARTING POSITION AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019, RESULTING FROM THE ACCELERATION OF RECEIPTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INVENTORY REQUIRED FOR OUR 16 NET NEW STORES OPENED DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019.  IN ORDER TO BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND MAXIMIZE SALES, WE CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR MERCHANDISING MIX AND INVENTORY LEVELS WITHIN OUR STORES. BY APPROPRIATELY MANAGING OUR INVENTORIES, WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO DELIVER A CONTINUAL FLOW OF FRESH MERCHANDISE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARD MORE PRODUCTIVE INVENTORIES BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF CURRENT INVENTORY AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL INVENTORY.  INVENTORY TURNOVER AND COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER ARE PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT INDICATE HOW EFFICIENTLY INVENTORY IS BOUGHT AND SOLD. THEY EACH MEASURE THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT WE OWN OUR INVENTORY.  INVENTORY TURNOVER IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING COST OF GOODS SOLD BY THE 13 MONTH AVERAGE COST VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY FOR THE PERIOD BEING MEASURED. OUR INVENTORY TURNOVER RATE DECLINED APPROXIMATELY  7% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING COMPARABLE STORE SALES BY THE AVERAGE COMPARABLE STORE RETAIL VALUE OF INVENTORY FOR THE PERIOD BEING MEASURED. THE COMPARABLE STORE RETAIL VALUE OF INVENTORIES IS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE ORIGINAL SALES PRICE OF ITEMS ON HAND REDUCED BY RETAIL REDUCTIONS (WHICH INCLUDE SALES, MARKDOWNS, AN ESTIMATED SHORTAGE ADJUSTMENT AND EMPLOYEE DISCOUNTS) FOR OUR COMPARABLE STORES. THE CALCULATION IS BASED ON A ROLLING 13 MONTH AVERAGE OF INVENTORY (AT ESTIMATED RETAIL VALUE) AND THE LAST 12 MONTHS\u2019 COMPARABLE STORE SALES. OUR COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER RATE IMPROVED APPROXIMATELY  2% DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INVENTORY TURNOVER AND COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE LATTER NOT INCLUDING DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND WAREHOUSE INVENTORY OR INVENTORY AT NEW AND NON-COMPARABLE STORES. INVENTORY HELD AT OUR WAREHOUSES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS INCLUDES MERCHANDISE BEING READIED FOR SHIPMENT TO OUR STORES AND PACK-AND-HOLD INVENTORY ACQUIRED OPPORTUNISTICALLY FOR FUTURE STORE RELEASE. THE MAGNITUDE OF PACK-AND-HOLD INVENTORY, AT ANY ONE POINT IN TIME, IS DEPENDENT ON THE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE MARKETPLACE.  WE PRESENT INVENTORY TURNOVER, BECAUSE IT DEMONSTRATES HOW EFFECTIVE WE ARE AT MANAGING OUR INVENTORY. WE PRESENT COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER AS WE BELIEVE THIS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL METRIC IN EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR MERCHANDISING EFFORTS, AS A FASTER COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER GENERALLY LEADS TO REDUCED MARKDOWNS AND MORE FRESH MERCHANDISE IN OUR STORES.  STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR PAYROLL IN ACCORDANCE WITH INCREASES OR DECREASES IN NET SALES. THE METHOD OF CALCULATING STORE PAYROLL VARIES ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, OUR STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES MAY DIFFER FROM OTHER RETAILERS. WE DEFINE STORE PAYROLL AS REGULAR AND OVERTIME PAYROLL FOR ALL STORE PERSONNEL AS WELL AS REGIONAL AND TERRITORY PERSONNEL, EXCLUSIVE OF PAYROLL CHARGES RELATED TO CORPORATE AND WAREHOUSE EMPLOYEES. STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS 9.0% AND 8.9% DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH 9.1% AND 8.8%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018.  LIQUIDITY.  LIQUIDITY MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH. MANAGEMENT MEASURES LIQUIDITY THROUGH CASH FLOW, WHICH IS THE MEASURE OF CASH GENERATED FROM OR USED IN OPERATING, FINANCING, AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, INCLUDING RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, DECREASED $15.1 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, COMPARED WITH A DECREASE  28  OF $49.6  MILLION DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  .

COST OF SALES  COST OF SALES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES REMAINED CONSISTENT AT 58.6% DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED MERCHANDISE MARGIN, WHICH WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS. PRODUCT SOURCING COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, IMPROVED APPROXIMATELY 10 BASIS POINTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES. ON A DOLLAR BASIS, COST OF SALES INCREASED $92.9 MILLION, OR 10.6%, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR OVERALL INCREASE IN SALES.  29  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 10 BASIS POINTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.

THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 10 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENT IN STORE OCCUPANCY COSTS, A 10 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCT SOURCING COSTS, A 10 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENT IN STORE PAYROLL, AND A 10 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENT IN OUR NATIONAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING AND DIRECT MARKETING EFFORTS, AS A RESULT OF OUR PROFIT IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE DEPRECIATION OF FIXED ASSETS AMOUNTED TO $52.3 MILLION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH $56.9 MILLION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE RECLASSIFICATION OF FAVORABLE LEASE COST FROM DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE TO SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING ASU 2016-02, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR NEW AND NON-COMPARABLE STORES.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE IMPROVED $1.1 MILLION TO $13.4 MILLION. THE IMPROVEMENT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE $150 MILLION PAYDOWN AND REPRICING OF OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY DURING FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AVERAGE BORROWINGS AND A HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON OUR ABL LINE OF CREDIT.  OUR AVERAGE INTEREST RATES AND AVERAGE BALANCES RELATED TO OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY AND OUR ABL LINE OF CREDIT, FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE TABLE BELOW.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS $11.2 MILLION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH $8.3 MILLION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS 11.6% COMPARED WITH 10.5% DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THE LOWER TAX RATE IN THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A ONE TIME DEFERRED TAX REVALUATION DUE TO CHANGES IN NEW JERSEY TAX LAW ENACTED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  30  AT THE END OF EACH INTERIM PERIOD WE ARE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE BEST ESTIMATE OF OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND THEN APPLY THAT RATE IN PROVIDING FOR INCOME TAXES ON A CURRENT YEAR-TO-DATE (INTERIM PERIOD) BASIS. USE OF THIS METHODOLOGY DURING  THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  RESULTED IN AN ANNUAL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF APPROXIMATELY  25% (BEFORE DISCR  ETE ITEMS) AS OUR BEST ESTIMATE. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 OF APPROXIMATELY 25% (BEFORE DISCRETE ITEMS).  NET INCOME  WE EARNED NET INCOME OF $84.6 MILLION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH $71.0 MILLION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THIS IMPROVEMENT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  COMPARED WITH THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  NET SALES  NET SALES IMPROVED APPROXIMATELY $267.8 MILLION, OR 8.9%, TO $3,284.9 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  AN INCREASE IN NET SALES OF $236.6  MILLION FROM OUR NEW AND NON-COMPARABLE STORES, AND  \u2022  AN INCREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES OF $56.2  MILLION, TO $2,967.5 MILLION; PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  \u2022  A $25.0  MILLION DECREASE RELATED TO THE NET IMPACT OF PERMANENTLY CLOSED STORES AND OTHER SALES ADJUSTMENTS.

DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, WE REVERSED $0.4 MILLION OF THIS ESTIMATED EXPENSE BASED ON ACTUAL EXPENSES INCURRED.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE DEPRECIATION OF FIXED ASSETS AMOUNTED TO $102.9 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH $107.4 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018.

INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE IMPROVED $2.3 MILLION TO $26.8 MILLION.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS $27.3 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH $25.7 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 WAS 14.4% COMPARED WITH 14.3% DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018.  NET INCOME  WE EARNED NET INCOME OF $162.3 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH $153.5 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018. THIS IMPROVEMENT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR ABILITY TO SATISFY INTEREST PAYMENT AND FUTURE PRINCIPAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS ON OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE WHICH, IN TURN, IS SUBJECT TO PREVAILING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TO FINANCIAL, BUSINESS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IF WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW TO SERVICE INTEREST PAYMENT AND FUTURE PRINCIPAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS ON OUR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS AND IF WE CANNOT BORROW OR OBTAIN EQUITY FINANCING TO SATISFY THOSE OBLIGATIONS, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE CANNOT BE ASSURED THAT ANY REPLACEMENT BORROWING OR EQUITY FINANCING COULD BE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ON TERMS SIMILAR TO OUR CURRENT FINANCING AGREEMENTS, OR AT ALL.  WE BELIEVE THAT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ALONG WITH OUR EXISTING CASH AND OUR ABL LINE OF CREDIT, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR EXPECTED CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS AND PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AS WELL AS THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO OFFSET DECLINES IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES WITH SAVINGS INITIATIVES IN THE EVENT THAT THE ECONOMY DECLINES.  32  CASH FLOW FOR THE  SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  COMPARED WITH THE  SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  WE USED $15.1 MILLION OF CASH FLOW DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH A USE OF $49.6  MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AMOUNTED TO $229.4 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH $166.3 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018. THE INCREASE IN OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR IMPROVED OPERATING RESULTS AND CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $164.0 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH $125.2 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018. THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO A NEW DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND OUR STORE EXPENDITURES (NEW STORES, REMODELS, AND OTHER STORE EXPENDITURES).  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $80.5 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH A USE OF $90.7 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018. THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN THE NET BORROWINGS ON OUR DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF SHARE REPURCHASES.  CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL ALSO IMPACT OUR CASH FLOWS. WORKING CAPITAL EQUALS CURRENT ASSETS (EXCLUSIVE OF RESTRICTED CASH) MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES. WE HAD A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AT AUGUST 3, 2019 OF $151.7 MILLION COMPARED WITH WORKING CAPITAL OF $32.0 MILLION AT AUGUST 4, 2018. THE DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-02, WHICH RESULTED IN ADDING A PORTION OF THE NEW LEASE LIABILITY TO CURRENT LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019 OF $2.3 MILLION.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, CASH SPEND FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, NET OF $23.4 MILLION OF LANDLORD ALLOWANCES, AMOUNTED TO $140.5 MILLION. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL SPEND APPROXIMATELY  $310  MILLION, NET OF APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION OF LANDLORD ALLOWANCES, IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING FISCAL 2019, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $155 MILLION, NET OF THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED LANDLORD ALLOWANCES, FOR STORE EXPENDITURES (NEW STORES, REMODELS AND OTHER STORE EXPENDITURES). IN ADDITION, WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL SPEND APPROXIMATELY $60  MILLION TO SUPPORT OUR SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVES, WITH THE REMAINING CAPITAL USED TO SUPPORT OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER BUSINESS INITIATIVES.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  ON AUGUST 15, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $300 MILLION OF COMMON STOCK, WHICH IS AUTHORIZED TO BE EXECUTED THROUGH AUGUST 2020. THIS REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS FUNDED USING OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND BORROWINGS ON OUR ABL LINE OF CREDIT.  DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, WE REPURCHASED 1,142,202 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR $174.1 MILLION, INCLUSIVE OF COMMISSIONS, UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019, WE HAD $124.3 MILLION REMAINING UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $400 MILLION OF COMMON STOCK, WHICH IS AUTHORIZED TO BE EXECUTED THROUGH AUGUST 2021.  WE ARE AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE, FROM TIME TO TIME, SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK ON THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF STOCK REPURCHASES WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE MARKET CONDITIONS AS WELL AS CORPORATE AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS. OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED, MODIFIED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME AND WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO REPURCHASE ANY AMOUNT OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THE PROGRAM.  DIVIDENDS  WE CURRENTLY DO, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO, RETAIN ALL AVAILABLE FUNDS AND ANY FUTURE EARNINGS TO FUND ALL OF THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, BUSINESS INITIATIVES, AND TO SUPPORT ANY POTENTIAL OPPORTUNISTIC CAPITAL STRUCTURE INITIATIVES. THEREFORE, AT THIS TIME, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE NEAR TERM. OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE LIMITED BY RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS OR MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER THE TERMS OF CURRENT AND ANY FUTURE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR INDEBTEDNESS. ANY FUTURE DETERMINATION TO PAY DIVIDENDS WILL BE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH COVENANTS IN OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR INDEBTEDNESS, AND WILL DEPEND UPON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEEMS RELEVANT.  33  IN ADDITION, SINCE WE ARE A HOLDING COMPANY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS SHOWN ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ARE HELD BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOW AND ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON THE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND THE DISTRIBUTION OR OTHER PAYMENT OF SUCH EARNINGS TO US IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS.  OPERATIONAL GROWTH  DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, WE OPENED 27 NEW STORES, INCLUSIVE OF SEVEN RELOCATIONS, AND CLOSED FOUR STORES, EXCLUSIVE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED RELOCATIONS, BRINGING OUR STORE COUNT AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019 TO 691 STORES, INCLUSIVE OF AN INTERNET STORE. WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE OUR GROWTH PLANS AND INVEST IN CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT MEET OUR FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. DURING FISCAL 2019, WE PLAN TO OPEN APPROXIMATELY 50 NET NEW STORES,  WHICH INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 75 GROSS NEW STORES, ALONG WITH APPROXIMATELY 25 STORE RELOCATIONS AND CLOSINGS.  WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES BOTH WITHIN OUR CURRENT MARKET AREAS AND IN OTHER REGIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ABILITY TO FIND SATISFACTORY LOCATIONS FOR OUR STORES IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS. THE OPENING OF STORES GENERALLY IS CONTINGENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE AVAILABILITY OF DESIRABLE LOCATIONS WITH SUITABLE STRUCTURES AND THE NEGOTIATION OF ACCEPTABLE LEASE TERMS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND SUITABLE LOCATIONS FOR NEW STORES OR THAT EVEN IF SUCH LOCATIONS ARE FOUND AND ACCEPTABLE LEASE TERMS ARE OBTAINED, WE WILL BE ABLE TO OPEN THE NUMBER OF NEW STORES PRESENTLY PLANNED. ASSUMING THAT APPROPRIATE LOCATIONS ARE IDENTIFIED, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EXECUTE OUR GROWTH STRATEGY WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING OUR CURRENT STORES.  DEBT AND HEDGING  AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019, OUR OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE $957.1 MILLION, INCLUSIVE OF ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT, UNDER OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY AND $96.9 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS ON OUR ABL FACILITY. OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS ALSO INCLUDE $31.5 MILLION OF CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019.  TERM LOAN FACILITY  AT AUGUST 3, 2019, OUR BORROWING RATE RELATED TO THE TERM LOAN FACILITY WAS  4.3%.  ABL LINE OF CREDIT  AT AUGUST 3, 2019, WE HAD $428.6 MILLION AVAILABLE UNDER THE ABL LINE OF CREDIT. THE MAXIMUM BORROWINGS UNDER THE FACILITY DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 AMOUNTED TO $255.0  MILLION. AVERAGE BORROWINGS DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 AMOUNTED TO $146.7  MILLION AT AN AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 3.7%.  HEDGING  ON DECEMBER 17, 2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT, WHICH WAS DESIGNATED AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE. THIS INTEREST RATE SWAP, WHICH HEDGES $450 MILLION OF OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY, BECAME EFFECTIVE MAY 31, 2019 AND MATURES DECEMBER 29, 2023.  CERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THE COMPANY HAD $1,173.5 MILLION OF PURCHASE COMMITMENTS RELATED TO GOODS THAT WERE NOT RECEIVED AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019. THERE WERE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES REGARDING OUR OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER CURRENT CONTRACTS FROM THOSE INCLUDED IN OUR FISCAL 2018 10-K.  34  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SEVERAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING OUR HISTORICAL AND FUTURE PERFORMANCE AS THESE POLICIES AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT AREAS THAT INVOLVE MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES. THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT (I) THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; (II) THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; AND (III) THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, INVENTORIES, LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL, INSURANCE RESERVES AND INCOME TAXES. HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE MEETS TWO CRITERIA: (1) IT REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS AND (2) THERE WOULD BE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM EITHER USING A DIFFERENT, ALTHOUGH REASONABLE, AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE OF THE ESTIMATE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD OR FROM REASONABLY LIKELY PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATE.  LEASES  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD UPDATE (ASU) 2016-02, \u201cLEASES.\u201d THE STANDARD\u2019S CORE PRINCIPLE IS TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY AMONG ORGANIZATIONS BY RECOGNIZING LEASE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND DISCLOSING KEY INFORMATION ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. WE ADOPTED THIS ASU AS OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2019.  WE APPLIED THE CHANGES FROM THE NEW GUIDANCE AT THE ADOPTION DATE AND RECOGNIZED A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION, AS ALLOWED UNDER ASU 2018-11, \u201cLEASES: TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS.\u201d WE DID NOT ADJUST PRIOR PERIODS. WE MADE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION NOT TO CAPITALIZE LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS. WE ELECTED THE TRANSITION PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS, WHICH ALLOWS US TO CARRY FORWARD FOR OUR EXISTING LEASES: I) THE HISTORICAL LEASE CLASSIFICATION AS EITHER OPERATING OR CAPITAL; II) ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE OR CONTAIN LEASES; AND III) CAPITALIZATION OF INITIAL DIRECT COSTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ELECTED THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS TO NOT SEPARATE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, TO NOT ASSESS WHETHER EXISTING OR EXPIRED LAND EASEMENTS CONTAIN A LEASE, AND TO EMPLOY HINDSIGHT WHEN DETERMINING LEASE TERMS FOR EXISTING LEASES ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION.  ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD ALSO RESULTED IN A CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CERTAIN EXPENSE RECOGNITION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO NET FAVORABLE LEASE COST, AS WELL AS A RECLASSIFICATION OF FAVORABLE LEASE COST FROM \u201cDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\u201d TO \u201cSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\u201d ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019. THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY.  OTHER THAN THE LEASE ACCOUNTING POLICY DISCUSSED ABOVE, OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, \u201cSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,\u201d INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2019.

WE SELL A RAPIDLY CHANGING ASSORTMENT OF APPAREL, HOME FASHIONS AND OTHER MERCHANDISE AT PRICES GENERALLY 20% TO 60% BELOW FULL-PRICE RETAILERS\u2019 (INCLUDING DEPARTMENT, SPECIALTY AND MAJOR ONLINE RETAILERS) REGULAR PRICES ON COMPARABLE MERCHANDISE, EVERY DAY. WE OPERATE OVER  4,400  STORES THROUGH OUR FOUR MAIN SEGMENTS: IN THE U.S., MARMAXX (WHICH OPERATES T.J. MAXX, MARSHALLS AND TJMAXX.COM) AND HOMEGOODS (WHICH OPERATES HOMEGOODS AND HOMESENSE); TJX CANADA (WHICH OPERATES WINNERS, HOMESENSE AND MARSHALLS IN CANADA); AND TJX INTERNATIONAL (WHICH OPERATES T.K.

IN ADDITION TO OUR FOUR MAIN SEGMENTS, SIERRA OPERATES SIERRA.COM AND RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. THE RESULTS OF SIERRA ARE INCLUDED IN THE MARMAXX SEGMENT.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  .  \u2013  NET SALES  INCREASE  D  5%  TO  $9.8 BILLION  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020  OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S  SECOND  QUARTER SALES OF  $9.3 BILLION  . AS OF  AUGUST 3, 2019  , THE NUMBER OF STORES IN OPERATION  INCREASE  D  5%  AND SELLING SQUARE FOOTAGE  INCREASE  D  4%  COMPARED TO THE END OF THE FISCAL  2019  SECOND  QUARTER.  \u2013  COMP SALES  INCREASE  D  2%  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020  OVER AN  INCREASE  OF  6%  FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR ENDED  AUGUST 4, 2018  . CUSTOMER TRAFFIC WAS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THE COMP SALES  INCREASE  AND WAS UP AT ALL FOUR MAJOR SEGMENTS.  \u2013  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020  WERE  $0.62  VERSUS  $0.58  PER SHARE IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  \u2013  OUR PRE-TAX MARGIN (THE RATIO OF PRE-TAX INCOME TO NET SALES) FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  10.4%  , A  0.2  PERCENTAGE POINT  DECREASE  COMPARED WITH  10.6%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  \u2013  OUR COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, RATIO FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  71.8%  , A  0.7  PERCENTAGE POINT  INCREASE  COMPARED WITH  71.1%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  \u2013  OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cSG&A\u201d) EXPENSE RATIO FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  17.7%  , A  0.5  PERCENTAGE POINT  DECREASE  COMPARED WITH  18.2%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  \u2013  OUR AVERAGE PER STORE INVENTORIES, INCLUDING INVENTORY ON HAND AT OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS (WHICH EXCLUDES INVENTORY IN TRANSIT) AND EXCLUDING OUR E-COMMERCE SITES AND SIERRA STORES, WERE  UP  6%  ON A REPORTED BASIS AND  7%  ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS AT THE END OF THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  AS COMPARED TO A  5%  INCREASE  IN AVERAGE PER STORE INVENTORIES ON A REPORTED BASIS AND A  6%  INCREASE  ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  \u2013  DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020  , WE RETURNED  $579  MILLION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  IMPACT OF BREXIT  THE U.K\u2019S DECISION TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION (\u201cEU\u201d), COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS \u201cBREXIT\u201d, REMAINS UNSETTLED. SHOULD THE U.K. EXIT THE EU, THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE OUTCOMES EACH OF WHICH CREATES RISKS FOR TJX, ESPECIALLY IN OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS. CURRENT U.K. LAW STATES THAT THE U.K. WILL LEAVE THE EU ON OCTOBER 31, 2019 WITH OR WITHOUT A COMPREHENSIVE WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU, THE LATTER COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A \"HARD BREXIT\". OUR TJX EUROPE MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS EVALUATED A RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, IDENTIFIED AREAS OF CONCERN AND IMPLEMENTED STRATEGIES TO HELP MITIGATE THEM.  OUR CURRENT EUROPEAN OPERATIONS BENEFIT FROM THE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND LABOR BETWEEN THE U.K. AND EU. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE BREXIT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY MOVE MERCHANDISE BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU. BREXIT COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR TALENT IN THE REGION, BOTH BY IMPACTING CURRENT ASSOCIATES, WHO ARE EITHER EU CITIZENS WORKING IN THE U.K. OR U.K. CITIZENS WORKING IN THE EU, AND POTENTIALLY IMPACTING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION FOR OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.  24  IF THE U.K. DOES EXIT THE EU, WE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE THAT FLOWS BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU. WE HAVE REALIGNED OUR EUROPEAN DIVISION\u2019S SUPPLY CHAIN TO REDUCE THE VOLUME OF MERCHANDISE FLOWING BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU AND HAVE ESTABLISHED RESOURCES AND SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT THIS PLAN. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR ASSOCIATES ABOUT BREXIT INCLUDING PROVIDING RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES THAT MAY BE REQUIRED POST-BREXIT. IN THE EVENT OF A HARD BREXIT, OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED, PARTICULARLY IN THE SHORT TERM.  IN ADDITION TO THE OPERATIONAL IMPACTS MENTIONED ABOVE, FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND BEHAVIOR, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INTEREST RATES, CUSTOMS DUTIES, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT TO OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE SHORT TERM WITH A HARD BREXIT.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THESE DEVELOPMENTS. WE BELIEVE THE STEPS WE HAVE TAKEN, AND PLAN TO TAKE IN THE EVENT OF A HARD BREXIT, WILL HELP US MITIGATE THE RISKS THAT WE EXPECT COULD RESULT FROM BREXIT.  NET SALES  NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  TOTALED  $9.8 BILLION  , A  5%  INCREASE  OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S  SECOND  QUARTER NET SALES OF  $9.3 BILLION  . THE  INCREASE  REFLECTS A  4%  INCREASE  FROM NON-COMP SALES, A  2%  INCREASE  FROM COMP SALES, OFFSET BY A  1%  NEGATIVE  IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THIS  INCREASE  COMPARES TO SALES  GROWTH  OF  12%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , WHICH REFLECTS A  6%  INCREASE  FROM COMP SALES, A  5%  INCREASE  FROM NON-COMP SALES, AND A  1%  POSITIVE  IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  NET SALES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  TOTALED  $19.1 BILLION  , A  6%  INCREASE  OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S  SIX  -MONTH NET SALES OF  $18.0 BILLION  . THE  INCREASE  REFLECTS A  4%  INCREASE  FROM COMP SALES, A  3%  INCREASE  FROM NON-COMP SALES, OFFSET BY A  1%  NEGATIVE  IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THIS  INCREASE  COMPARES TO A SALES  GROWTH  OF  12%  FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , WHICH REFLECTS A  5%  INCREASE  FROM COMP SALES, A  5%  INCREASE  FROM NON-COMP SALES, AND A  2%  POSITIVE  IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  AS OF  AUGUST 3, 2019  , OUR STORE COUNT  INCREASE  D  5%  AND SELLING SQUARE FOOTAGE  INCREASE  D  4%  COMPARED TO THE END OF THE  SECOND  QUARTER LAST YEAR.  COMP SALES FOR BOTH THE QUARTER AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  REFLECT AN INCREASE IN THE CUSTOMER TRAFFIC ACROSS ALL MAJOR DIVISIONS. ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, APPAREL AND HOME FASHIONS' PERFORMANCE WAS COMPARABLE FOR THE QUARTER AND APPAREL OUTPERFORMED HOME FASHIONS FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019.  FOR BOTH THE QUARTER AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  , COMP SALES GROWTH IN THE U.S. WAS STRONGEST IN THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST REGIONS. COMP SALES GROWTH FOR TJX INTERNATIONAL WAS ABOVE THE CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE, WHEREAS TJX CANADA WAS BELOW THE CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE.  WE DEFINE COMPARABLE STORE SALES, OR COMP SALES, TO BE SALES OF STORES THAT HAVE BEEN IN OPERATION FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF TWO CONSECUTIVE FISCAL YEARS, OR IN OTHER WORDS, STORES THAT ARE STARTING THEIR THIRD FISCAL YEAR OF OPERATION. WE CALCULATE COMP SALES ON A 52-WEEK BASIS BY COMPARING THE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR WEEKLY PERIODS THAT ARE MOST CLOSELY ALIGNED. RELOCATED STORES AND STORES THAT HAVE CHANGED IN SIZE ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE ORIGINAL STORE, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE IMPACT OF THESE STORES ON THE CONSOLIDATED COMP PERCENTAGE IS IMMATERIAL.  WE DEFINE CUSTOMER TRAFFIC TO BE THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN STORES INCLUDED IN THE COMP SALES CALCULATION AND AVERAGE TICKET TO BE THE AVERAGE RETAIL PRICE OF THE UNITS SOLD. WE DEFINE AVERAGE TRANSACTION OR AVERAGE BASKET TO BE THE AVERAGE DOLLAR VALUE OF TRANSACTIONS INCLUDED IN THE COMP SALES CALCULATION.  SALES EXCLUDED FROM COMP SALES (\u201cNON-COMP SALES\u201d) CONSIST OF SALES FROM.  \u2013  NEW STORES - STORES THAT HAVE NOT YET MET THE COMP SALES CRITERIA, WHICH REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF NON-COMP SALES  \u2013  STORES THAT ARE CLOSED PERMANENTLY OR FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME  \u2013  SALES FROM OUR E-COMMERCE SITES, MEANING SIERRA.COM, TJMAXX.COM AND TKMAXX.COM  WE DETERMINE WHICH STORES ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMP SALES CALCULATION AT THE BEGINNING OF A FISCAL YEAR AND THE CLASSIFICATION REMAINS CONSTANT THROUGHOUT THAT YEAR UNLESS A STORE IS CLOSED PERMANENTLY OR FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD DURING THAT FISCAL YEAR. STARTING IN FISCAL 2020, SIERRA STORES THAT OTHERWISE FIT THE COMP STORE DEFINITION ARE INCLUDED IN COMP STORES IN OUR MARMAXX SEGMENT.  COMP SALES OF OUR FOREIGN SEGMENTS ARE CALCULATED BY TRANSLATING THE CURRENT YEAR\u2019S COMP SALES OF OUR FOREIGN SEGMENTS AT THE SAME EXCHANGE RATES USED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS REMOVES THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A MORE ACCURATE MEASURE OF SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  25  COMP SALES MAY BE REFERRED TO AS \u201cSAME STORE\u201d SALES BY OTHER RETAIL COMPANIES. THE METHOD FOR CALCULATING COMP SALES VARIES ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY, THEREFORE OUR MEASURE OF COMP SALES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THAT OF OTHER RETAIL COMPANIES.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE FOLLOWING PERIODS.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  AUGUST 4, 2018  AUGUST 3, 2019  AUGUST 4, 2018  NET SALES  100.0%  100.0%  100.0%  100.0%  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  71.8  71.1  71.7  71.1  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  17.7  18.2  18.0  18.0  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  INCOME BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  *  10.4%  10.6%  10.3%  10.8%  *  FIGURES MAY NOT FOOT DUE TO ROUNDING.  IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES  OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR OR A DIVISION\u2019S LOCAL CURRENCY IN RELATION TO OTHER CURRENCIES. TWO WAYS IN WHICH FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AFFECT OUR REPORTED RESULTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u2013  TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN OPERATING RESULTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS.  IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE TRANSLATE THE OPERATIONS OF TJX CANADA AND TJX INTERNATIONAL FROM LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING CURRENCY RATES IN EFFECT AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN COMPARABLE PRIOR PERIODS CAN RESULT IN MEANINGFUL VARIATIONS IN NET SALES, NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH AS WELL AS THE NET SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS OF THESE SEGMENTS. CURRENCY TRANSLATION GENERALLY DOES NOT AFFECT OPERATING MARGINS, OR AFFECTS THEM ONLY SLIGHTLY, AS SALES AND EXPENSES OF THE FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE TRANSLATED AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME RATES WITHIN A GIVEN PERIOD.  \u2013  INVENTORY-RELATED DERIVATIVES.  WE ROUTINELY ENTER INTO INVENTORY-RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON EARNINGS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON MERCHANDISE PURCHASES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE LOCAL CURRENCIES OF OUR DIVISIONS, PRINCIPALLY TJX CANADA AND TJX INTERNATIONAL. AS WE HAVE NOT ELECTED \u201cHEDGE ACCOUNTING\u201d FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS, AS DEFINED BY U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d), WE RECORD A MARK-TO-MARKET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD. IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS, THE INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT OF THE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT IS EFFECTIVELY OFFSET WHEN THE INVENTORY BEING HEDGED IS RECEIVED AND PAID FOR. WHILE THESE EFFECTS OCCUR EVERY REPORTING PERIOD, THEY ARE OF MUCH GREATER MAGNITUDE WHEN THERE ARE SUDDEN AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES DURING A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT ON THESE DERIVATIVES DOES NOT AFFECT NET SALES, BUT IT DOES AFFECT THE COST OF SALES, OPERATING MARGINS AND EARNINGS WE REPORT.  WE REFER TO THE IMPACT OF THE ABOVE TWO ITEMS THROUGHOUT OUR DISCUSSION AS \u201cFOREIGN CURRENCY.\u201d THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CAN HAVE ON VARIOUS TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN AN OPERATING DIVISION\u2019S LOCAL CURRENCY. WHEN DISCUSSING THE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF THE EFFECT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON SUCH TRANSACTIONS WE REFER TO IT AS \u201cTRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE.\u201d  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS  71.8%  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  , AN  INCREASE  OF  0.7  PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM  71.1%  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  AND WAS  71.7%  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  , AN  INCREASE  OF  0.6  PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM  71.1%  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 4, 2018  . THE  INCREASE  FOR BOTH PERIODS WAS DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN AND HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS.  THE DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS DRIVEN BY A LOWER MARKON, IN PART DUE TO TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AND HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SG&A EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, WERE  17.7%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  , A  DECREASE  OF  0.5  PERCENTAGE POINTS OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S  SECOND  QUARTER RATIO OF  18.2%  . SG&A EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, WERE  18.0%  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  AND FLAT TO LAST YEAR'S RATIO FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 4, 2018  . THE EXPENSE RATIO FOR BOTH PERIODS REFLECTS THE FAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON OF THE CORPORATE IT RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO TJX'S  CHARITABLE FOUNDATIONS MADE IN FISCAL  2019  AND A BENEFIT FROM INSURANCE CLAIM SETTLEMENTS RECEIVED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF  26  FISCAL  2020  . INCREMENTAL SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND WAGE INCREASES PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE FAVORABLE IMPACTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FULLY OFFSET THEM FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  THE COMPONENTS OF INTEREST EXPENSE, NET ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED  IN THOUSANDS  AUGUST 3,  2019  AUGUST 4,  2018  AUGUST 3,  2019  AUGUST 4,  2018  INTEREST EXPENSE  $15,350  $17,283  $30,707  $34,648  CAPITALIZED INTEREST  (446  )  (1,328  )  (1,165  )  (2,976  )  INTEREST (INCOME)  (12,007  )  (12,926  )  (25,828  )  (24,495  )  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  $2,897  $3,029  $3,714  $7,177  THE  DECREASE  IN NET INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN FISCAL  2019  , WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO THE ELIMINATION OF BUILD-TO-SUIT ACCOUNTING AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD. NET INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  WAS ALSO FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY ADDITIONAL INTEREST INCOME, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER RETURN RATES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE  NOTE A  \u2014  BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS  25.7%  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO  25.5%  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS  25.5%  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  COMPARED TO  25.3%  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 4, 2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REDUCTION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFIT FROM SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND THE EXPANDED LIMITATIONS ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION, OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN THE IMPACT OF THE FOREIGN OPERATIONS.  NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE  NET INCOME FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  $759 MILLION  , OR  $0.62  PER DILUTED SHARE COMPARED TO  $740 MILLION  , OR  $0.58  PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . FOREIGN CURRENCY HAD A NEUTRAL IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR BOTH THE  SECOND  QUARTERS OF FISCAL  2020  AND FISCAL  2019.  NET INCOME FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  WAS  $1.5 BILLION  , OR  $1.19  PER DILUTED SHARE COMPARED TO  $1.5 BILLION  , OR  $1.15  PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 4, 2018  . FOREIGN CURRENCY HAD A NEUTRAL IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO A $0.01 POSITIVE IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 4, 2018.  OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS, WHICH REDUCE OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING, BENEFITED OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH BY APPROXIMATELY 3% IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  AND 3% FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020.  SEGMENT INFORMATION  WE OPERATE FOUR MAIN BUSINESS SEGMENTS. OUR MARMAXX SEGMENT (T.J.

THE  INCREASE  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER REPRESENTS A  2%  INCREASE  FROM COMP SALES AND A  2%  INCREASE  FROM NON-COMP SALES. THE  SIX  -MONTH  INCREASE  IN NET SALES INCLUDED A  4%  INCREASE  FROM COMP SALES AND A  2%  INCREASE  FROM NON-COMP SALES. THE INCREASE IN COMP SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC. GEOGRAPHICALLY, COMP SALES GROWTH FOR THE QUARTER AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  WAS STRONGEST IN THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST REGIONS. HOME FASHIONS OUTPERFORMED APPAREL AND APPAREL PERFORMED AT THE SEGMENT AVERAGE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  AND FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019.

THE  DECREASE  IN SEGMENT MARGIN FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIOD WAS DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN (PRIMARILY HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS AND LOWER MARKON) AND AN INCREASE IN SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS. THESE REDUCTIONS IN SEGMENT MARGIN WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INSURANCE RECOVERIES DUE TO THE SETTLEMENT OF BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE HURRICANE DAMAGE IN PUERTO RICO, AND BY LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ACCRUALS IN FISCAL  2020.  OUR U.S. E-COMMERCE BUSINESSES, WHICH REPRESENT LESS THAN 3% OF MARMAXX\u2019S NET SALES FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  AND FISCAL  2019  , DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON YEAR-OVER-YEAR SEGMENT MARGIN COMPARISONS FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020.  28  HOMEGOODS  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED  U.S. DOLLARS IN MILLIONS  AUGUST 3,  2019  AUGUST 4,  2018  AUGUST 3,  2019  AUGUST 4,  2018  NET SALES  $1,425  $1,327  $2,822  $2,597  SEGMENT PROFIT  $129  $142  $266  $289  SEGMENT PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  9.0%  10.7%  9.4%  11.1%  INCREASE IN COMP SALES  0%  3%  0%  2%  STORES IN OPERATION AT END OF PERIOD.

THE  INCREASE  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER REPRESENTS A  7%  INCREASE  FROM NON-COMP SALES AND FLAT COMP SALES. THE  SIX  -MONTH  INCREASE  IN NET SALES REPRESENTS AN  INCREASE  OF  9%  FROM NON-COMP SALES AND FLAT COMP SALES. THE FLAT COMP SALES FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  WAS THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE AVERAGE BASKET.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO  9.0%  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO  10.7%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.

THE DECLINE IN SEGMENT MARGIN FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND  SIX  -MONTH-PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS, THE INVESTMENT IN STORE GROWTH, EXPENSE DELEVERAGE ON THE FLAT COMP SALES AND A DECLINE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN. MERCHANDISE MARGIN DECREASED FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS LAST YEAR. THIS DECREASE IS A RESULT OF HIGHER MARKDOWNS FOR BOTH PERIODS AS WELL AS INCREASED FREIGHT COSTS FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS.  29  FOREIGN SEGMENTS  TJX CANADA  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED  U.S. DOLLARS IN MILLIONS  AUGUST 3,  2019  AUGUST 4,  2018  AUGUST 3,  2019  AUGUST 4,  2018  NET SALES  $967  $938  $1,815  $1,792  SEGMENT PROFIT  $118  $139  $215  $264  SEGMENT PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  12.2%  14.8%  11.9%  14.7%  INCREASE IN COMP SALES  1%  6%  1%  5%  STORES IN OPERATION AT END OF PERIOD.

THE  INCREASE  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER REPRESENTS A  4%  INCREASE  FROM NON-COMP SALES, A  1%  INCREASE  IN COMP SALES GROWTH, OFFSET BY A  2%  NEGATIVE  IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE  SIX  MONTH  INCREASE  IN NET SALES REPRESENTS A  3%  INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES, COMP SALES GROWTH OF  1%  AND CURRENCY TRANSLATION WHICH  NEGATIVELY  IMPACTED SALES GROWTH BY  3%  . THE  INCREASE  IN COMP SALES FOR BOTH PERIODS WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE AVERAGE BASKET.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN  DECREASE  D TO  12.2%  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO  14.8%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THIS  DECREASE  IN THE SEGMENT MARGIN PRIMARILY REFLECTS A 1.5 PERCENTAGE POINT DECLINE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN, THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON THE MARK-TO-MARKET OF INVENTORY DERIVATIVES AND THE EXPENSE DELEVERAGE ON THE  1%  COMP SALES GROWTH. THE DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE AS THE CHANGE IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES INCREASED TJX CANADA'S COST OF MERCHANDISE PURCHASED IN U.S. DOLLARS AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR AND HIGHER MARKDOWNS.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN  DECREASE  D TO  11.9%  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  COMPARED TO  14.7%  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 4, 2018  . THIS DECREASE IN THE SEGMENT MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A 1.3 PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN, DUE TO THE SAME FACTORS IMPACTING THE QUARTER AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. IN ADDITION, SEGMENT MARGIN REFLECTS AN UNFAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON RELATED TO A LEASE BUYOUT GAIN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  AND EXPENSE DELEVERAGE ON THE  1%  COMP SALES GROWTH.  30  TJX INTERNATIONAL  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED  U.S. DOLLARS IN MILLIONS  AUGUST 3,  2019  AUGUST 4,  2018  AUGUST 3,  2019  AUGUST 4,  2018  NET SALES  $1,283  $1,218  $2,514  $2,403  SEGMENT PROFIT  $50  $49  $79  $90  SEGMENT PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  3.9%  4.0%  3.1%  3.7%  INCREASE IN COMP SALES  6%  4%  7%  3%  STORES IN OPERATION AT END OF PERIOD.

THE  INCREASE  IN THE  SIX  -MONTH PERIOD REPRESENTS A  7%  INCREASE  IN COMP SALES GROWTH, A  4%  INCREASE  FROM NON-COMP SALES, OFFSET BY A  6%  NEGATIVE  IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE  INCREASE  IN COMP SALES FOR BOTH PERIODS WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC. E-COMMERCE SALES REPRESENT LESS THAN 3% OF TJX INTERNATIONAL\u2019S NET SALES FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  AND FISCAL  2019.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN  DECREASE  D TO  3.9%  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO  4.0%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THIS  DECREASE  IN SEGMENT MARGIN REFLECTS THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE EXPENSE LEVERAGE ON THE STRONG COMP SALES.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN  DECREASE  D TO  3.1%  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  COMPARED TO  3.7%  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 4, 2018  . THIS DECREASE IN SEGMENT MARGIN WAS DRIVEN BY THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR MARK-TO-MARKET IMPACT OF THE INVENTORY DERIVATIVES AND THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE WHICH COLLECTIVELY MORE THAN OFFSET THE EXPENSE LEVERAGE ON THE STRONG COMP SALES GROWTH.  GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED  IN MILLIONS  AUGUST 3,  2019  AUGUST 4,  2018  AUGUST 3,  2019  AUGUST 4,  2018  GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE  $129  $164  $250  $268  GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES REPRESENTS THOSE COSTS NOT SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES ARE PRIMARILY INCLUDED IN SG&A EXPENSES. THE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT OF OUR FUEL HEDGES IS INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  DECREASE  D PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON FROM THE CORPORATE IT RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO TJX'S CHARITABLE FOUNDATIONS MADE IN FISCAL  2019  . THE IMPACT OF THESE ITEMS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREMENTAL SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019.  ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN FUNDED THROUGH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, SUPPLEMENTED, AS NEEDED, BY SHORT-TERM BANK BORROWINGS AND THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. AS OF  AUGUST 3, 2019  , THERE WERE NO SHORT-TERM BANK BORROWINGS OR COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING.  31  WE BELIEVE OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS AND OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, DESCRIBED IN  NOTE I  \u2013  LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT LINES  OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ARE MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR OPERATING NEEDS OVER THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR.  AS OF  AUGUST 3, 2019  , WE HELD  $2.2 BILLION  IN CASH AND  NO  SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. APPROXIMATELY  $0.7 BILLION  OF OUR CASH WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WITH  $0.3 BILLION  HELD IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE PROVISIONALLY INTEND TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST ANY UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS. TJX PROVIDED FOR ALL APPLICABLE STATE AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES ON ALL UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN CANADA, PUERTO RICO, ITALY, INDIA, HONG KONG AND VIETNAM THROUGH  AUGUST 3, 2019  . IF WE REPATRIATE CASH FROM SUCH SUBSIDIARIES, WE SHOULD NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL TAX EXPENSE AND OUR CASH WOULD BE REDUCED BY THE AMOUNT OF WITHHOLDING TAXES PAID.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $0.9 BILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  AND  $1.6 BILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  . THE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN EACH OF THESE FISCAL PERIODS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING EARNINGS.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOR THE  FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  DECREASE  D  BY  $0.7 BILLION  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  . THE  DECLINE  IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, NET OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $0.4 BILLION.  IN ADDITION, LAST YEAR'S FIRST QUARTER CASH FLOWS WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY A DECREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSES PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PREFUNDING OF CERTAIN SERVICE CONTRACTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 2018.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES RESULTED IN NET CASH OUTFLOWS OF  $0.6 BILLION  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  AND  $0.1 BILLION  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 4, 2018  . THE CASH OUTFLOWS FOR BOTH PERIODS WERE DRIVEN BY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  FISCAL 2020  PRIMARILY REFLECTED PROPERTY ADDITIONS FOR NEW STORES, STORE IMPROVEMENTS AND RENOVATIONS AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN OUR OFFICES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, INCLUDING BUYING AND MERCHANDISING SYSTEMS AND OTHER INFORMATION SYSTEMS. CASH OUTFLOWS FOR PROPERTY ADDITIONS WERE  $0.6 BILLION  FOR BOTH THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  AND FISCAL  2019  . WE ANTICIPATE THAT CAPITAL SPENDING FOR FISCAL  2020  WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION. WE PLAN TO FUND THESE EXPENDITURES THROUGH INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS.  WE PURCHASED  $0.2 BILLION  OF INVESTMENTS IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , AND THESE CASH OUTFLOWS WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY  $0.6 BILLION  OF INFLOWS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS THAT WERE SOLD OR MATURED IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  . THE FISCAL  2019  INVESTING ACTIVITY PRIMARILY RELATED TO SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WHICH HAD INITIAL MATURITIES IN EXCESS OF 90 DAYS AND ARE NOT CLASSIFIED AS CASH ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS PRESENTED.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES RESULTED IN NET CASH OUTFLOWS OF  $1.1 BILLION  IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  FISCAL  2020  AND  $1.3 BILLION  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 4, 2018  .  THESE CASH OUTFLOWS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY EQUITY REPURCHASES AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.  EQUITY  UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS, WE PAID  $0.7 BILLION  TO REPURCHASE AND RETIRE  13.3 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR STOCK ON A SETTLEMENT BASIS IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  . THESE OUTFLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, NET OF SHARES WITHHELD FOR TAXES IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  .

IN FEBRUARY 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE REPURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL $3.0 BILLION OF TJX COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME. IN FEBRUARY 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN ADDITIONAL REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZING THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $1.5 BILLION OF TJX STOCK. AS OF  AUGUST 3, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY  $2.5 BILLION  REMAINED AVAILABLE UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PLANS. WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO REPURCHASE APPROXIMATELY $1.75 BILLION OF STOCK UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS IN FISCAL  2020  . WE DETERMINE THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REPURCHASES BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING EXCESS CASH FLOW, LIQUIDITY, ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR ASSESSMENT OF PROSPECTS FOR OUR BUSINESS, LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS.  AS SUCH, WE MAY ADJUST THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THESE PURCHASES.  DIVIDENDS  WE DECLARED QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK WHICH TOTALED  $0.46  PER SHARE IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  AND  $0.39  PER SHARE IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  .

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  REGULATED OPERATIONS  NET INCOME WAS  $81.8 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $69.9 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . NET INCOME AT MINNESOTA POWER WAS HIGHER THAN 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE AND PROPERTY TAX EXPENSES, INCREASED COST RECOVERY RIDER REVENUE, THE TIMING OF FUEL ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE RECOVERIES AND HIGHER REVENUE FROM WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS UNDER FERC FORMULA-BASED RATES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER KWH SALES. NET INCOME AT SUPERIOR WATER, LIGHT AND POWER WAS HIGHER THAN 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER RATES AND LOWER OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES. OUR AFTER-TAX EQUITY EARNINGS IN ATC WERE HIGHER THAN 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS.  ALLETE CLEAN ENERGY  NET INCOME WAS  $7.7 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $14.9 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .

SECOND QUARTER 2019 FORM 10-Q  32  COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018  (CONTINUED)  REGULATED OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  REVENUE FROM KWH SALES DECREASED $15.0 MILLION FROM  2018  REFLECTING LOWER SALES RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL AND MUNICIPAL CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS LOWER SALES TO OTHER POWER SUPPLIERS. SALES TO RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS DECREASED FROM 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO MILDER WEATHER IN 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. SALES TO MUNICIPAL CUSTOMERS DECREASED IN 2019 AS A RESULT OF ADDITIONAL CUSTOMER SELF-GENERATION IN 2019. SALES TO OTHER POWER SUPPLIERS DECREASED IN 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO FEWER MARKET SALES AND SALES UNDER PSAS AS A RESULT OF LESS GENERATION AVAILABLE FOR SALE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE COMMENCEMENT OF MINNESOTA POWER\u2019S PSA WITH OCONTO ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE IN JANUARY 2019.

REVENUE FROM ELECTRIC SALES TO PIPELINES AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR  8  PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATING REVENUE IN  2019  (  6  PERCENT IN  2018  ).  REVENUE WAS $3.4 MILLION LOWER THAN 2018 REFLECTING THE TIMING OF MINNESOTA POWER\u2019S PROVISION FOR TAX REFORM REFUND IN 2018. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, MINNESOTA POWER RESERVED FOR INCOME TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM THE REDUCTION OF THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE ENACTED AS PART OF THE TCJA. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, MINNESOTA POWER REVERSED THE RESERVE AS THE MPUC ALLOWED MINNESOTA POWER TO RETAIN THESE INCOME TAX BENEFITS TO MOSTLY OFFSET AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE RESULTING FROM THE RECONSIDERATION OF ITS DECISION IN MINNESOTA POWER\u2019S GENERAL RATE CASE TO REDUCE THE DEPRECIABLE LIVES OF BOSWELL UNIT 3, UNIT 4 AND COMMON FACILITIES TO 2035. (SEE  OPERATING EXPENSES - DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  .)  FUEL ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE REVENUE INCREASED $5.9 MILLION DUE TO  PERIOD OVER PERIOD TIMING OF RECOVERIES FOR FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO RETAIL AND MUNICIPAL CUSTOMERS.  COST RECOVERY RIDER REVENUE CONTRIBUTED AN INCREMENTAL $4.2 MILLION OVER CURRENT BASE RATES COMPARED TO 2018 (SEE NOTE 2. REGULATORY MATTERS) PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE GNTL AND LOWER TRANSMISSION MARGINS RELATED TO OUR PORTION OF CAPX2020 TRANSMISSION LINES. TRANSMISSION MARGINS FOR CAPX2020 TRANSMISSION LINES RECOGNIZED BELOW THOSE ASSUMED IN MINNESOTA POWER BASE RATES RESULT IN INCREASED COST RECOVERY RIDER REVENUE TO OFFSET THE IMPACT OF THE LOWER MARGINS.  REVENUE FROM WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS UNDER FERC FORMULA-BASED RATES INCREASED $1.8 MILLION FROM 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER RATES.  OPERATING EXPENSES  DECREASED  $11.7 MILLION  , OR  5 PERCENT  , FROM  2018.  FUEL, PURCHASED POWER AND GAS \u2013 UTILITY  EXPENSE  DECREASED  $8.6 MILLION  , OR  9 PERCENT  , FROM  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER KWH SALES. FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER EXPENSE RELATED TO OUR RETAIL AND MUNICIPAL CUSTOMERS IS RECOVERED THROUGH THE FUEL ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE.  TRANSMISSION SERVICES \u2013 UTILITY  EXPENSE  INCREASED  $2.4 MILLION  , OR  14 PERCENT  , FROM  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER MISO\u2010RELATED EXPENSE.  ALLETE, INC. SECOND QUARTER 2019 FORM 10-Q  33  COMPARISON OF THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018  (CONTINUED)  REGULATED OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE  EXPENSE  DECREASED  $0.7 MILLION  , OR  1 PERCENT  , FROM  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALARY AND BENEFIT EXPENSES, AND LOWER BAD DEBT EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EXPENSES FOR PLANNED MAINTENANCE OUTAGES AT OUR GENERATION FACILITIES.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  EXPENSE  DECREASED  $4.3 MILLION  , OR  10 PERCENT  , FROM  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF MODIFICATIONS OF THE DEPRECIABLE LIVES FOR BOSWELL AS PART OF MINNESOTA POWER\u2019S GENERAL RATE CASE. AS PART OF ITS DECISION IN MINNESOTA POWER\u2019S GENERAL RATE CASE IN 2018, THE MPUC EXTENDED THE DEPRECIABLE LIVES OF BOSWELL UNIT 3, UNIT 4 AND COMMON FACILITIES TO 2050, AND SHORTENED THE DEPRECIABLE LIVES OF BOSWELL UNIT 1 AND UNIT 2 TO 2022, RESULTING IN A NET DECREASE TO DEPRECIATION EXPENSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, AS PART OF THE RECONSIDERATION OF ITS DECISION IN MINNESOTA POWER\u2019S GENERAL RATE CASE, THE MPUC REDUCED THE DEPRECIABLE LIVES OF BOSWELL UNIT 3, UNIT 4 AND COMMON FACILITIES TO 2035, RESULTING IN HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018. (SEE  OPERATING REVENUE  .)  INTEREST EXPENSE  DECREASED  $0.7 MILLION  , OR  5 PERCENT  , FROM  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE LONG-TERM DEBT BALANCES AND LOWER INTEREST RATES. WE RECORD INTEREST EXPENSE FOR REGULATED OPERATIONS PRIMARILY BASED ON RATE BASE AND AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STRUCTURE, AND ALLOCATE THE BALANCE TO CORPORATE AND OTHER.  EQUITY EARNINGS  INCREASED  $0.5 MILLION  , OR  12 PERCENT  , FROM  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN ATC.  OTHER INCOME  INCREASED  $1.8 MILLION  FROM  2018  REFLECTING VARIOUS INDIVIDUALLY IMMATERIAL ITEMS.  INCOME TAX BENEFIT  DECREASED  $2.4 MILLION  FROM 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PRE-TAX INCOME. WE EXPECT OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2019 TO BE A LOWER INCOME TAX BENEFIT THAN IN 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PRE-TAX INCOME.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2019 WAS A LOWER BENEFIT PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER TAX RATE ON THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF U.S. WATER SERVICES AND HIGHER PRE-TAX INCOME.  WE EXPECT OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2019 TO BE SIMILAR TO 2018 REFLECTING THE SALE OF U.S. WATER SERVICES AND HIGHER PRODUCTION TAX CREDITS GENERATED BY ALLETE CLEAN ENERGY. THE EFFECTIVE RATE DEVIATED FROM THE COMBINED STATUTORY RATE OF APPROXIMATELY  28  PERCENT PRIMARILY DUE TO PRODUCTION TAX CREDITS. (SEE NOTE 9. INCOME TAX EXPENSE.)  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CERTAIN ACCOUNTING MEASUREMENTS UNDER GAAP INVOLVE MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT ABOUT SUBJECTIVE FACTORS AND ESTIMATES, THE EFFECTS OF WHICH ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. ACCOUNTING MEASUREMENTS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE MOST CRITICAL TO OUR REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION INCLUDE: REGULATORY ACCOUNTING, PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH AND LIFE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, AND TAXATION. THESE POLICIES ARE REVIEWED WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND SUMMARIZED IN PART II, ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR  2018  FORM 10-K.  OUTLOOK  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SEE OUR  2018  FORM 10-K.  ALLETE IS AN ENERGY COMPANY COMMITTED TO EARNING A FINANCIAL RETURN THAT REWARDS OUR SHAREHOLDERS, ALLOWS FOR REINVESTMENT IN OUR BUSINESSES AND SUSTAINS GROWTH. THE COMPANY HAS LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES OF ACHIEVING AVERAGE ANNUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH OF 5 PERCENT TO 7 PERCENT, AND PROVIDING A DIVIDEND PAYOUT COMPETITIVE WITH OUR INDUSTRY. REGULATED OPERATIONS IS PROJECTED TO HAVE AVERAGE ANNUAL EARNINGS GROWTH OF 4 PERCENT TO 5 PERCENT AND OUR ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELATED SERVICES BUSINESSES ARE PROJECTED TO HAVE AVERAGE ANNUAL EARNINGS GROWTH OF AT LEAST 15 PERCENT OVER THE LONG-TERM.  ALLETE IS PREDOMINATELY A REGULATED UTILITY THROUGH MINNESOTA POWER, SWL&P AND AN INVESTMENT IN ATC. ALLETE\u2019S STRATEGY IS TO REMAIN PREDOMINATELY A REGULATED UTILITY WHILE INVESTING IN ITS ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELATED SERVICES AND OTHER BUSINESSES TO COMPLEMENT ITS REGULATED BUSINESSES, BALANCE EXPOSURE TO THE UTILITY\u2019S INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS AND PROVIDE POTENTIAL LONG-TERM EARNINGS GROWTH. ALLETE EXPECTS NET INCOME FROM REGULATED OPERATIONS TO BE APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME IN 2019. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELATED SERVICES AND OTHER BUSINESSES TO NET INCOME IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE AS ALLETE GROWS THESE OPERATIONS. ALLETE EXPECTS ITS BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE REGULATED, CONTRACTED OR RECURRING REVENUES, AND TO SUPPORT SUSTAINED GROWTH IN NET INCOME AND CASH FLOW.  REGULATED OPERATIONS.  MINNESOTA POWER\u2019S LONG-TERM STRATEGY IS TO BE THE LEADING ELECTRIC ENERGY PROVIDER IN NORTHEASTERN MINNESOTA BY PROVIDING SAFE, RELIABLE AND COST-COMPETITIVE ELECTRIC ENERGY, WHILE COMPLYING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL PERMIT CONDITIONS AND RENEWABLE ENERGY REQUIREMENTS. KEEPING THE COST OF ENERGY PRODUCTION COMPETITIVE ENABLES MINNESOTA POWER TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE IN THE WHOLESALE POWER MARKETS AND MINIMIZES RETAIL RATE INCREASES TO HELP MAINTAIN CUSTOMER VIABILITY. AS PART OF MAINTAINING COST COMPETITIVENESS, MINNESOTA POWER INTENDS TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO POSSIBLE FUTURE CARBON AND GHG LEGISLATION BY RESHAPING ITS GENERATION PORTFOLIO, OVER TIME, TO REDUCE ITS RELIANCE ON COAL. (SEE  ENERGYFORWARD.  ) WE WILL MONITOR AND REVIEW PROPOSED ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND MAY CHALLENGE THOSE THAT ADD CONSIDERABLE COST WITH LIMITED ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT. MINNESOTA POWER WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE CUSTOMER GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AND COST RECOVERY RIDER APPROVALS FOR TRANSMISSION, RENEWABLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS WORK WITH REGULATORS TO EARN A FAIR RATE OF RETURN.

THE MPUC ISSUED AN ORDER DATED MARCH 12, 2018, IN MINNESOTA POWER\u2019S GENERAL RATE CASE APPROVING A RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY OF  9.25  PERCENT AND A  53.81  PERCENT EQUITY RATIO. FINAL RATES WENT INTO EFFECT ON DECEMBER 1, 2018, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REVENUE OF APPROXIMATELY  $13 MILLION  ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. INTERIM RATES WERE COLLECTED FROM JANUARY 1, 2017, THROUGH NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WHICH WERE FULLY OFFSET BY THE RECOGNITION OF A CORRESPONDING RESERVE. MINNESOTA POWER RECORDED A RESERVE FOR AN INTERIM RATE REFUND, NET OF DISCOUNTS PROVIDED TO EITE CUSTOMERS, OF  $40.0 MILLION  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, WHICH WAS REFUNDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.  2018 WISCONSIN GENERAL RATE CASE.  IN AN ORDER DATED DECEMBER 20, 2018, THE PSCW APPROVED A RATE INCREASE FOR SWL&P INCLUDING A RETURN ON EQUITY OF  10.4 PERCENT  AND A  55.0 PERCENT  EQUITY RATIO. FINAL RATES WENT INTO EFFECT JANUARY 1, 2019, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REVENUE OF APPROXIMATELY  $1.3 MILLION  ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS.  INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS AND PROSPECTIVE ADDITIONAL LOAD.  INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS.  ELECTRIC POWER IS ONE OF SEVERAL KEY INPUTS IN THE TACONITE MINING, PAPER, PULP AND SECONDARY WOOD PRODUCTS, PIPELINE AND OTHER INDUSTRIES. APPROXIMATELY  53 PERCENT  OF OUR REGULATED UTILITY KWH SALES IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , WERE MADE TO OUR INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS (  49 PERCENT  IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  ).  TACONITE AND IRON CONCENTRATE  . MINNESOTA POWER\u2019S TACONITE CUSTOMERS ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING UP TO APPROXIMATELY 41 MILLION TONS OF TACONITE PELLETS ANNUALLY. TACONITE PELLETS PRODUCED IN MINNESOTA ARE PRIMARILY SHIPPED TO NORTH AMERICAN STEEL MAKING FACILITIES THAT ARE PART OF THE INTEGRATED STEEL INDUSTRY. STEEL PRODUCED FROM THESE NORTH AMERICAN FACILITIES IS USED PRIMARILY IN THE MANUFACTURE OF AUTOMOBILES, APPLIANCES, PIPE AND TUBE PRODUCTS FOR THE GAS AND OIL INDUSTRY, AND IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. HISTORICALLY, LESS THAN 10 PERCENT OF MINNESOTA TACONITE PRODUCTION HAS BEEN EXPORTED OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA.  THERE HAS BEEN A GENERAL HISTORICAL CORRELATION BETWEEN U.S. STEEL PRODUCTION AND MINNESOTA TACONITE PRODUCTION. THE AMERICAN IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE, AN ASSOCIATION OF NORTH AMERICAN STEEL PRODUCERS, REPORTED THAT U.S. RAW STEEL PRODUCTION OPERATED AT APPROXIMATELY  81 PERCENT  OF CAPACITY DURING THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019  COMPARED TO  76 PERCENT  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018  . THE WORLD STEEL ASSOCIATION, AN ASSOCIATION OF STEEL PRODUCERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL STEEL INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS, AND STEEL RESEARCH INSTITUTES REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 85 PERCENT OF WORLD STEEL PRODUCTION, PROJECTED U.S. STEEL CONSUMPTION IN  2019  WILL INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY ONE PERCENT COMPARED TO  2018.  MINNESOTA POWER\u2019S TACONITE CUSTOMERS MAY EXPERIENCE ANNUAL VARIATIONS IN PRODUCTION LEVELS DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, SHORT-TERM DEMAND CHANGES OR MAINTENANCE OUTAGES. WE ESTIMATE THAT A ONE MILLION TON CHANGE IN MINNESOTA POWER\u2019S TACONITE CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRODUCTION WOULD IMPACT OUR ANNUAL EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY $0.04, NET OF EXPECTED POWER MARKETING SALES AT CURRENT PRICES. CHANGES IN WHOLESALE ELECTRIC PRICES OR CUSTOMER CONTRACTUAL DEMAND NOMINATIONS COULD IMPACT THIS ESTIMATE. MINNESOTA POWER PROACTIVELY SELLS POWER IN THE WHOLESALE POWER MARKETS THAT IS TEMPORARILY NOT REQUIRED BY INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS TO OPTIMIZE THE VALUE OF ITS GENERATING FACILITIES. LONG-TERM REDUCTIONS IN TACONITE PRODUCTION OR A PERMANENT SHUT DOWN OF A TACONITE CUSTOMER MAY LEAD MINNESOTA POWER TO FILE A GENERAL RATE CASE TO RECOVER LOST REVENUE.  NORTHSHORE MINING.  CLIFFS HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAS COMPLETED AN INVESTMENT IN ITS MINNESOTA ORE OPERATIONS WITH AN APPROXIMATELY $92 MILLION INVESTMENT TO EXPAND CAPACITY FOR PRODUCING DIRECT REDUCED-GRADE PELLETS AT NORTHSHORE MINING. CLIFFS IS CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTING A HOT BRIQUETTED IRON PRODUCTION PLANT IN TOLEDO, OHIO, AND HAS BEGUN SHIPPING DIRECT REDUCED-GRADE PELLETS TO THE TOLEDO PLANT IN ANTICIPATION OF THE PLANNED START OF OPERATIONS IN MID-2020. MINNESOTA POWER HAS A PSA THROUGH 2031 WITH SILVER BAY POWER, WHICH PROVIDES THE MAJORITY OF THE ELECTRIC SERVICE REQUIREMENTS FOR NORTHSHORE MINING. (SEE  SILVER BAY POWER  .)  SILVER BAY POWER.  IN 2016, MINNESOTA POWER AND SILVER BAY POWER ENTERED INTO A PSA THROUGH 2031. SILVER BAY POWER SUPPLIES APPROXIMATELY 90 MW OF LOAD TO NORTHSHORE MINING, AN AFFILIATE OF SILVER BAY POWER, WHICH HAS BEEN SERVED PREDOMINATELY THROUGH SELF-GENERATION BY SILVER BAY POWER. THROUGH 2019, MINNESOTA POWER WILL SUPPLY SILVER BAY POWER WITH AT LEAST 50 MW OF ENERGY AND SILVER BAY POWER HAS THE OPTION TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL ENERGY FROM MINNESOTA POWER AS IT TRANSITIONS AWAY FROM SELF-GENERATION. BY DECEMBER 31, 2019, SILVER BAY POWER IS EXPECTED TO CEASE SELF-GENERATION AND MINNESOTA POWER IS EXPECTED TO SUPPLY THE ENERGY REQUIREMENTS FOR SILVER BAY POWER.  ALLETE, INC.

IN APRIL 2018, A FIRE AT HUSKY ENERGY\u2019S REFINERY IN SUPERIOR, WISCONSIN DISRUPTED OPERATIONS AT THE FACILITY. UNDER NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS, SWL&P PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY 14 MW OF AVERAGE MONTHLY DEMAND TO HUSKY ENERGY IN ADDITION TO WATER SERVICE. THE FACILITY REMAINS AT MINIMAL OPERATIONS, AND THE REFINERY IS NOT EXPECTED TO RESUME NORMAL OPERATIONS UNTIL  2021.  PROSPECTIVE ADDITIONAL LOAD.  MINNESOTA POWER IS PURSUING NEW WHOLESALE AND RETAIL LOADS IN AND AROUND ITS SERVICE TERRITORY. CURRENTLY, SEVERAL COMPANIES IN NORTHEASTERN MINNESOTA CONTINUE TO PROGRESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCE-BASED PROJECTS THAT REPRESENT LONG-TERM GROWTH POTENTIAL AND LOAD DIVERSITY FOR MINNESOTA POWER. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE PROJECTS.  POLYMET  . POLYMET IS PLANNING TO START A NEW COPPER-NICKEL AND PRECIOUS METAL (NON-FERROUS) MINING OPERATION IN NORTHEASTERN MINNESOTA. IN 2015, POLYMET ANNOUNCED THE COMPLETION OF THE FINAL EIS BY STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES, WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PUBLISHED IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER AND MINNESOTA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY BOARD MONITOR. THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES (DNR) AND THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS HAVE BOTH ISSUED FINAL RECORDS OF DECISION, FINDING THE FINAL EIS ADEQUATE.  IN 2016, POLYMET SUBMITTED APPLICATIONS FOR WATER-RELATED PERMITS WITH THE DNR AND MPCA, AN AIR QUALITY PERMIT WITH THE MPCA, AND A STATE PERMIT TO MINE APPLICATION WITH THE DNR DETAILING ITS OPERATIONAL PLANS FOR THE MINE. IN NOVEMBER 2018, THE DNR ISSUED POLYMET\u2019S PERMIT TO MINE AND CERTAIN WATER-RELATED PERMITS. IN DECEMBER 2018, THE MPCA ISSUED POLYMET\u2019S FINAL STATE WATER AND AIR QUALITY PERMITS. ON MARCH 21, 2019, THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS ISSUED POLYMET\u2019S FINAL FEDERAL PERMIT. POLYMET NOW HOLDS ALL NECESSARY PERMITS TO CONSTRUCT AND OPERATE ITS MINING OPERATION. IN JUNE 2018, THE U.S. FOREST SERVICE AND POLYMET CLOSED ON A LAND EXCHANGE, WHICH RESULTED IN POLYMET OBTAINING SURFACE RIGHTS TO LAND NEEDED TO DEVELOP ITS MINING OPERATION. MINNESOTA POWER COULD SUPPLY BETWEEN 45 MW AND 50 MW OF LOAD UNDER A 10\u2010YEAR POWER SUPPLY CONTRACT WITH POLYMET THAT WOULD BEGIN UPON START-UP OF OPERATIONS.  ENERGYFORWARD.

THE FIFTH PPA PROVIDES FOR MINNESOTA POWER TO PURCHASE 50 MW OF CAPACITY FROM MANITOBA HYDRO AT FIXED PRICES. THE PPA BEGAN IN JUNE 2017 AND EXPIRES IN MAY 2020.  ALLETE, INC. SECOND QUARTER 2019 FORM 10-Q  41  OUTLOOK (CONTINUED)  TRANSMISSION.  WE CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN TRANSMISSION OPPORTUNITIES THAT STRENGTHEN OR ENHANCE THE TRANSMISSION GRID OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION BETWEEN SOURCES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AND END USERS. THESE INCLUDE THE GNTL, INVESTMENTS TO ENHANCE OUR OWN TRANSMISSION FACILITIES, INVESTMENTS IN OTHER TRANSMISSION ASSETS (INDIVIDUALLY OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHERS) AND OUR INVESTMENT IN ATC.  GREAT NORTHERN TRANSMISSION LINE.  AS A CONDITION OF THE  250  -MW LONG-TERM PPA ENTERED INTO WITH MANITOBA HYDRO, CONSTRUCTION OF ADDITIONAL TRANSMISSION CAPACITY IS REQUIRED. AS A RESULT, MINNESOTA POWER IS CONSTRUCTING THE GNTL, AN APPROXIMATELY  220  \u2010MILE  500  -KV TRANSMISSION LINE BETWEEN MANITOBA AND MINNESOTA\u2019S IRON RANGE THAT WAS PROPOSED BY MINNESOTA POWER AND MANITOBA HYDRO IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE ELECTRIC GRID, ENHANCE REGIONAL RELIABILITY AND PROMOTE A GREATER EXCHANGE OF SUSTAINABLE ENERGY.  IN A 2016 ORDER, THE MPUC APPROVED THE ROUTE PERMIT FOR THE GNTL, AND IN 2016, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ISSUED A PRESIDENTIAL PERMIT TO CROSS THE U.S.\u2010CANADIAN BORDER, WHICH WAS THE FINAL MAJOR REGULATORY APPROVAL NEEDED BEFORE CONSTRUCTION IN THE U.S. COULD BEGIN. CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES COMMENCED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017, AND WITH CONSTRUCTION ON SCHEDULE, MINNESOTA POWER EXPECTS THE GNTL TO BE COMPLETE AND IN-SERVICE BY MID-2020. THE TOTAL PROJECT COST IN THE U.S., INCLUDING SUBSTATION WORK, IS ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $750 MILLION  , OF WHICH MINNESOTA POWER\u2019S PORTION IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $345 MILLION  ; THE DIFFERENCE WILL BE RECOVERED FROM A SUBSIDIARY OF MANITOBA HYDRO AS NON-SHAREHOLDER CONTRIBUTIONS TO CAPITAL. TOTAL PROJECT COSTS OF  $510.8 MILLION  HAVE BEEN INCURRED THROUGH  JUNE 30, 2019  , OF WHICH  $272.7 MILLION  HAS BEEN RECOVERED FROM A SUBSIDIARY OF MANITOBA HYDRO. (SEE NOTE 7.

ATC\u2019S AUTHORIZED RETURN ON EQUITY IS  10.32 PERCENT  , OR  10.82 PERCENT  INCLUDING AN INCENTIVE ADDER FOR PARTICIPATION IN A REGIONAL TRANSMISSION ORGANIZATION. IN 2016, A FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE RULED ON A COMPLAINT PROPOSING A REDUCTION IN THE BASE RETURN ON EQUITY TO  9.70 PERCENT  , OR  10.20 PERCENT  INCLUDING AN INCENTIVE ADDER FOR PARTICIPATION IN A REGIONAL TRANSMISSION ORGANIZATION, SUBJECT TO APPROVAL OR ADJUSTMENT BY THE FERC. A FINAL DECISION FROM THE FERC ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE\u2019S RECOMMENDATION IS PENDING.  ATC\u2019S 10-YEAR TRANSMISSION ASSESSMENT, WHICH COVERS THE YEARS 2018 THROUGH 2027, IDENTIFIES A NEED FOR BETWEEN $2.8 BILLION AND $3.4 BILLION IN TRANSMISSION SYSTEM INVESTMENTS. THESE INVESTMENTS BY ATC, IF UNDERTAKEN, ARE EXPECTED TO BE FUNDED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH, DEBT AND INVESTOR CONTRIBUTIONS. AS OPPORTUNITIES ARISE, WE PLAN TO MAKE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN ATC THROUGH GENERAL CAPITAL CALLS BASED UPON OUR PRO RATA OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN ATC.  ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND RELATED SERVICES.

THE GAP BETWEEN WHOLESALE PRODUCTION AND RETAIL SHIPMENTS IN THE RECREATIONAL VEHICLE (\"RV\") MARKET CONTINUED TO INCREASE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, AS WHOLESALE UNIT SHIPMENTS DECREASED AT DOUBLE-DIGIT RATES WHILE RETAIL SHIPMENTS DECLINED AT SINGLE-DIGIT RATES. AS RV DEALERS CONTINUED TO ALIGN INVENTORY LEVELS WITH RETAIL DEMAND, RV ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (\"OEMS\") CONTINUED TO ADJUST PRODUCTION LEVELS, AND WE EXPECT OEM PRODUCTION TO ALIGN WITH RETAIL DEMAND ONCE DEALER INVENTORY LEVELS ARE ALIGNED WITH RETAIL DEMAND. WE BELIEVE THAT OVERALL DEALER SENTIMENT AT RECENT RV SHOWS THUS FAR IN 2019 HAS BEEN POSITIVE AND RETAIL TRAFFIC AND SALES ARE PROGRESSING WELL DURING THE YEAR.  THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE ITS CONTENT PER UNIT IN ALL MARKETS DESPITE THE ADDITIONAL HEADWINDS RELATED TO INCLEMENT WEATHER IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE NEAR-TERM DIRECTION OF INTEREST RATES, UNCERTAINTY AROUND TARIFFS, AND COMMODITY COST VOLATILITY.

AT THE SAME TIME, WE ACHIEVED ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 AND REALIZED SAVINGS RELATED TO SYNERGISTIC OPPORTUNITIES RESULTING FROM ACQUISITIONS WE HAVE MADE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.  RV INDUSTRY  THE RV INDUSTRY IS OUR PRIMARY MARKET AND COMPRISED  56%  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019. SALES FROM THE RV INDUSTRY DECREASED  14%  AND  12%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS.  ACCORDING TO THE RECREATION VEHICLE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION (\u201cRVIA\u201d), WHOLESALE SHIPMENTS TOTALED 116,605 UNITS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, A DECLINE OF 13% COMPARED TO 134,502 UNITS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018. TOWABLE UNITS AND MOTORIZED UNITS, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR 89% AND 11%, RESPECTIVELY, OF SECOND QUARTER 2019 WHOLESALE UNITS, WERE DOWN 13% AND 18% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. WHOLESALE UNIT SHIPMENTS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 DECREASED 20% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THE FUTURE RETAIL DEMAND TRAJECTORY REMAINS POSITIVE BASED ON NEW AND YOUNGER BUYERS AND THE EMERGENCE OF INCREMENTAL REPEAT BUYERS IN THE CHANNEL, INCREASED PARTICIPATION BY MILLENNIALS, THE CONTINUED SHIFT TO SMALLER TRAVEL TRAILERS, AND OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, USED RV INVENTORY LEVELS REMAIN LOW WITH RISING PRICES, SUPPORTING THE DEMAND FOR NEW RVS IN THE LONG-TERM.  THE RVIA\u2019S LATEST PUBLISHED EXPECTATIONS FOR 2019 PROJECT WHOLESALE UNIT SHIPMENTS TO RANGE FROM APPROXIMATELY 396,000 UNITS TO 431,000 UNITS, REPRESENTING A DECLINE IN THE RANGE OF 11% TO 18% FROM 2018. WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT RV DEALER INVENTORIES, CURRENTLY AT THEIR LOWEST LEVEL IN FIVE YEARS, WILL CONTINUE TO NORMALIZE AS WE PROGRESS THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND WILL SUPPORT A RETURN TO WHOLESALE SHIPMENT LEVELS ALIGNED MORE CLOSELY WITH RETAIL DEMAND IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND FINAL SIX MONTHS OF 2019.  WE HAVE CONTINUED TO CAPTURE MARKET SHARE THROUGH OUR STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, LINE EXTENSIONS, AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND HAVE A FAVORABLE VIEW OF GROWTH FOR THE RV INDUSTRY BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING.  \u2022  ATTRACTIVE INDUSTRY DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS WITH NEW AND YOUNGER BUYERS ENTERING THE MARKET AND BABY BOOMERS REACHING RETIREMENT AGE;  \u2022  READILY AVAILABLE FINANCING AND IMPROVING CONSUMER CREDIT;  \u2022  NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS COMING TO MARKET;  \u2022  INCREASED STRENGTH IN THE OVERALL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING LOWER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES, IMPROVING TRENDS IN WAGES AND IMPROVING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE LEVELS; AND  \u2022  THE VALUE OF THE TRAVEL AND LEISURE LIFESTYLE RELATED TO SPENDING QUALITY TIME WITH FAMILIES.  MARINE INDUSTRY  SALES TO THE MARINE INDUSTRY, WHICH REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  14%  AND  15%  OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  , RESPECTIVELY, INCREASED  39%  AND  64%  COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, OVERALL MARINE RETAIL UNIT SHIPMENTS IN THE POWERBOAT SECTOR, WHICH IS THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY MARINE MARKET, DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 6% AND 7%, RESPECTIVELY, WITH ALUMINUM FISHING DECREASING 13% AND 14% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, RESPECTIVELY, PONTOON SALES DECREASING 4% AND 5%, RESPECTIVELY, FIBERGLASS DECREASING 3% AND 4%, RESPECTIVELY, AND SKI AND WAKE SALES INCREASING 1% AND 2%, RESPECTIVELY.  ADVERSE WEATHER AND FLOODING IN CERTAIN REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY IMPACTED MARINE RETAIL SHIPMENTS IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2019, PARTICULARLY IN THE PONTOON AND ALUMINUM FISHING CATEGORIES. DESPITE THIS IMPACT, WE BELIEVE THERE IS LONG-TERM FUNDAMENTAL POSITIVE DEMAND SUPPORTED BY CONSUMER ECONOMIC METRICS, AGING BOATS IN SERVICE AND THE RELATED REPLACEMENT CYCLE. ACCORDING TO INDUSTRY SOURCES, THE AVERAGE AGE OF BOATS IN SERVICE IS APPROXIMATELY 24 TO 25 YEARS COMPARED TO A 30-YEAR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE, AND APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION BOATS ARE EXPECTED TO BE RETIRED OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.  25  INDICATORS CURRENTLY POINT TOWARDS A DEPLETION IN THE FINAL SIX MONTHS OF 2019 OF DEALER INVENTORY ACCUMULATION THAT WAS A RESULT OF THE ADVERSE WEATHER IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2019. FACTORING IN THE IMPACT OF WEATHER IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2019, WE EXPECT AN OVERALL DECLINE IN POWERBOAT RETAIL UNIT SHIPMENTS FOR 2019 OF MID-SINGLE DIGITS.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE MARINE MARKET IS POISED TO CONTINUE ITS RECOVERY WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR A LONG RUNWAY OF SLOW AND STEADY GROWTH AS OEMS IN THIS MARKET CONTINUE TO OFFER MORE VALUE-ADDED CONTENT AND INCREASED COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE ON BOATS, CONSISTENT WITH THE MARINE LEISURE LIFESTYLE EXPERIENCE. OUR MARINE PORTFOLIO COMPANIES ARE COMPRISED OF A HIGH QUALITY BRAND PLATFORM THAT IS GENERATING SIGNIFICANT ORGANIC GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. THE COMPANY'S COMBINATION OF DESIGN, ENGINEERING, MANUFACTURING AND FABRICATION CAPABILITIES, ALONG WITH ITS GROWING GEOGRAPHIC FOOTPRINT AND COMPREHENSIVE PRODUCT OFFERINGS TO ITS CUSTOMERS IN THE MARINE MARKET, PROVIDES CONTINUING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FULLY INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS AND ADDITIONAL CONTENT FOR THE MARINE OEMS.  MH INDUSTRY  SALES TO THE MH INDUSTRY, WHICH REPRESENTED  18%  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  , INCREASED  56%  AND  63%  COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. BASED ON INDUSTRY DATA FROM THE MANUFACTURED HOUSING INSTITUTE AND THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATE FOR THE MONTH OF JUNE, MH WHOLESALE UNIT SHIPMENTS DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 3% AND 8% IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  , RESPECTIVELY. SIMILAR TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, MANUFACTURED HOUSING CONTINUES TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY WET WEATHER CONDITIONS IN CERTAIN REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY WHERE MOVING INVENTORY AND SETTING FOUNDATIONS AND HOUSES HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT. NEVERTHELESS, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS WITHIN THE MH MARKET INDICATE STRONG EXPECTED DEMAND PATTERNS RELATED TO FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS AND THOSE LOOKING TO DOWNSIZE.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS WELL-POSITIONED TO CAPITALIZE ON PENT UP DEMAND AND THE SIGNIFICANT UPSIDE POTENTIAL OF THE MH MARKET IN THE LONG-TERM, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE INCREASING ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE SINGLE-FAMILY MANUFACTURED HOUSING OPTION AND THE COMBINATION OF ITS NATIONWIDE GEOGRAPHIC FOOTPRINT, AVAILABLE CAPACITY IN CURRENT MH CONCENTRATED LOCATIONS, AND CURRENT CONTENT PER UNIT LEVELS.  FACTORS THAT MAY FAVORABLY IMPACT PRODUCTION LEVELS FURTHER IN THIS INDUSTRY INCLUDE IMPROVING QUALITY CREDIT STANDARDS IN THE RESIDENTIAL HOUSING MARKET, NEW JOBS GROWTH, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, FAVORABLE CHANGES IN FINANCING REGULATIONS, A NARROWING SPREAD IN INTEREST RATES ON MH LOANS AND MORTGAGES ON TRADITIONAL RESIDENTIAL \"STICK-BUILT\" HOUSING AND IMPROVEMENT IN CONDITIONS IN THE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES MARKETS FOR MANUFACTURED HOUSING LOANS.  INDUSTRIAL MARKET  THE INDUSTRIAL MARKET IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF THE KITCHEN CABINET INDUSTRY, HOSPITALITY, RETAIL AND COMMERCIAL FIXTURES MARKET, OFFICE AND HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE MARKET AND REGIONAL DISTRIBUTORS. SALES TO THIS MARKET REPRESENTED  12%  AND  11%  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED SALES IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AND DECREASED  3%  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED  1%  IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS.  OVERALL, OUR REVENUES IN THESE MARKETS ARE FOCUSED ON THE RESIDENTIAL HOUSING, HOSPITALITY, HIGH-RISE HOUSING AND OFFICE, COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION AND INSTITUTIONAL FURNITURE MARKETS. SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING STARTS DECLINED 6% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WHILE MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL STARTS INCREASED 16% FOR THE SAME PERIOD. COMBINED NEW HOUSING STARTS DECREASED LESS THAN 1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING STARTS DECREASED 5%, WHILE MULTIFAMILY HOUSING STARTS DECREASED 1%, WITH COMBINED HOUSING STARTS DECREASING 4%.  INTEREST RATE INCREASES AND TARIFFS IN THE PAST YEAR HAVE CREATED SOME HEADWINDS, BUT POTENTIAL DEMAND REMAINS STRONG GIVEN THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAPACITY AND INVENTORIES. WE BELIEVE THESE FACTORS PRESENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTINUED PENT UP DEMAND ALONG WITH IMPROVING CONSUMER CREDIT AND STRONG JOBS AND WAGE GROWTH. IN ADDITION, DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS RELATED TO NEW BUYERS AND THOSE LOOKING TO DOWNSIZE ARE ALIGNED WELL WITH OUR CORE HOUSING AND INDUSTRIAL MARKET MODEL.  THE INDUSTRIAL MARKET IS PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND MORE SPECIFICALLY, CONDITIONS IN THE RESIDENTIAL HOUSING MARKET. WE ESTIMATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 60% OF OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS IS DIRECTLY TIED TO THE RESIDENTIAL HOUSING MARKET, WITH THE REMAINING 40% DIRECTLY TIED TO THE NON-RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THERE IS A DIRECT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS IN THE RESIDENTIAL HOUSING MARKET AND NEW RESIDENTIAL HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AND REMODELING ACTIVITIES. SALES TO THE INDUSTRIAL MARKET GENERALLY LAG NEW RESIDENTIAL HOUSING STARTS BY FOUR TO SIX MONTHS.  26  FISCAL YEAR 2019 OUTLOOK  THE 16 ACQUISITIONS WE COMPLETED IN 2017 AND 2018 CONTINUE TO PRESENT ORGANIC GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AND SYNERGIES TO FURTHER INCREASE MARKET SHARE GAINS, EXPAND GEOGRAPHICALLY, ESTABLISH BEST PRACTICES ACROSS ALL OF OUR BRANDS, AND SERVICE OUR CUSTOMERS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT A RETURN TO A MORE NORMALIZED PATTERN OF RV WHOLESALE UNIT PRODUCTION IN ALIGNMENT WITH RETAIL DEMAND FOR THE LATTER HALF OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  BASED ON ITS MOST RECENT FORECAST, THE RVIA EXPECTS THE PERCENTAGE DECLINE IN RV WHOLESALE UNIT SHIPMENTS FOR FISCAL 2019 TO RANGE FROM 11% TO 18% COMPARED TO FULL YEAR 2018, REFLECTING THE CONTINUED RECALIBRATION OF DEALER INVENTORY LEVELS. ON THE RETAIL SIDE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS RV RETAIL UNIT SHIPMENTS TO EXHIBIT A MID-SINGLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE DECLINE IN 2019 WITH POTENTIAL UPSIDE BASED ON SUBSIDING HEADWINDS RELATED TO INTEREST RATES, TARIFFS, AND COMMODITY PRICES.  IN THE MARINE MARKET, WE ANTICIPATE THAT A RETAIL UNIT DECLINE IN THE POWERBOAT SECTOR OF THIS MARKET WILL BE MID-SINGLE DIGITS IN 2019 MOSTLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE EFFECT OF INCLEMENT WEATHER, BUT BELIEVE THERE IS OVERALL POSITIVE MOMENTUM BASED ON THE INCREASING AGE OF BOATS IN SERVICE AND CONTINUED POSITIVE DEMOGRAPHICS AS OEMS POSITION THEMSELVES FOR THE EXPECTED STRONG 2020 MODEL SEASON.  ON THE MH SIDE, WE ARE CURRENTLY FORECASTING LOW-TO-MID SINGLE DIGIT GROWTH RATES IN WHOLESALE UNIT SHIPMENTS FOR  2019  , AND A LOW-SINGLE DIGIT GROWTH RATE IN NEW HOUSING STARTS OVERALL, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR CONTENT AND MARKET SHARE IN BOTH OF THESE MARKET SECTORS BEYOND THE GENERAL INDUSTRY EXPECTATIONS AS A RESULT OF INCREASING MARKET PENETRATION, STRATEGIC GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSIONS, AND CROSS SELLING OPPORTUNITIES.  OUR TEAM REMAINS FOCUSED ON STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS IN OUR EXISTING, SIMILAR OR COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES, EXPANDING OPERATIONS IN TARGETED REGIONAL TERRITORIES, CAPTURING MARKET SHARE AND INCREASING OUR PER UNIT CONTENT, KEEPING COSTS ALIGNED WITH REVENUE OVER THE INTERMEDIATE TERM, MAXIMIZING OPERATING EFFICIENCIES, FOCUSING ON STRATEGIC CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO ACHIEVE COST REDUCTIONS, LABOR EFFICIENCIES AND INCREASED CAPACITY, TALENT MANAGEMENT, ENGAGEMENT AND RETENTION, AND THE EXECUTION OF OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGIC AGENDA.  IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGIC AGENDA, WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE TARGETED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT NEW BUSINESS AND LEVERAGE OUR OPERATING PLATFORM. THE CURRENT CAPITAL PLAN FOR FULL YEAR  2019  INCLUDES EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY  $30 MILLION  RELATED PRIMARILY TO STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSIONS, THE STRATEGIC REPLACEMENT AND UPGRADING OF PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES AND INCREASE CAPACITY, NEW PROCESS AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND OTHER STRATEGIC CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE IMPROVEMENTS.  27  REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS  SECOND  QUARTER AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO 2018  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE PERCENTAGE RELATIONSHIP TO NET SALES OF CERTAIN ITEMS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  SECOND QUARTER ENDED  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  JULY 1, 2018  JUNE 30, 2019  JULY 1, 2018  NET SALES  100.0%  100.0%  100.0%  100.0%  COST OF GOODS SOLD  81.6  81.0  82.1  81.6  GROSS PROFIT  18.4  19.0  17.9  18.4  WAREHOUSE AND DELIVERY EXPENSES  4.3  3.1  4.1  3.1  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  5.4  5.6  5.8  5.7  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS  1.3  1.5  1.4  1.4  OPERATING INCOME  7.4  8.8  6.6  8.2  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  1.4  1.0  1.4  0.9  INCOME TAXES  1.5  2.0  1.2  1.7  NET INCOME  4.5  5.8  4.0  5.6  NET SALES  . NET SALES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 INCREASED $8.3 MILLION, OR 1%, TO $613.2 MILLION FROM $604.9 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018. THE COMPANY'S NET SALES INCREASED IN TWO OF ITS PRIMARY MARKETS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WITH INCREASES OF 39% IN MARINE AND 56% IN MH, PARTLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE OF 3% IN INDUSTRIAL AND 14% IN RV MARKET SALES.  NET SALES IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 INCREASED $64.7 MILLION, OR 6% TO $1,221.4 MILLION FROM $1,156.7 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE COMPANY'S NET SALES INCREASED IN THREE OF ITS PRIMARY MARKETS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 WITH INCREASES OF 64% IN MARINE, 63% IN MH AND 1% IN INDUSTRIAL, PARTLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE OF 12% IN RV MARKET SALES.  THE CONSOLIDATED NET SALES INCREASE IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  PRIMARILY REFLECTED REVENUE FROM NINE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN FISCAL YEAR 2018. IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE 2018 ACQUISITIONS, INCREASES IN SALES REFLECTED INCREASED PENETRATION THROUGH GEOGRAPHIC AND PRODUCT EXPANSION EFFORTS IN THE MARINE AND MH MARKETS.  REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018 WAS $65.0 MILLION AND $77.6 MILLION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE COMPANY\u2019S RV CONTENT PER UNIT (ON A TRAILING TWELVE-MONTH BASIS) FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 19% TO $3,135 FROM $2,639 FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018. THE MARINE CONTENT PER RETAIL UNIT (ON A TRAILING TWELVE-MONTH BASIS) FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 93% TO AN ESTIMATED $1,655 FROM $856 FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018. MH CONTENT PER UNIT (ON A TRAILING TWELVE-MONTH BASIS) FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 54% TO AN ESTIMATED $3,884 FROM $2,520 FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  COST OF GOODS SOLD.  COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED $10.5 MILLION, OR 2%, TO $500.6 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 FROM $490.1 MILLION IN 2018. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 TO 81.6% FROM 81.0% IN 2018. FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED $58.1 MILLION, OR 6%, TO $1,002.3 MILLION FROM $944.2 MILLION IN 2018. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 TO 82.1% FROM 81.6% IN 2018.  COST OF GOODS SOLD AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS IMPACTED DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  BY: (I) DECREASED RV REVENUE RELATIVE TO OVERALL FIXED OVERHEAD COSTS; (II) THE LOWER MARGIN PROFILE OF LASALLE BRISTOL (\"LASALLE\"), WHICH WAS ACQUIRED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND (III) INVENTORY SOLD IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 WHICH REFLECTED HIGHER OPERATING OVERHEAD AND INPUT COSTS INCURRED IN THE LATTER PART OF 2018 RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT  28  COMMODITIES MARKET. PART OF THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF GOODS SOLD PERCENTAGE WAS OFFSET BY LEVERAGING FIXED COSTS IN THE MARINE AND INDUSTRIAL SECTORS AND BY THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITIONS OVER THE LAST 18 TO 24 MONTHS THAT HAVE A HIGHER MARGIN PROFILE. IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY'S COST OF GOODS SOLD PERCENTAGE CAN BE IMPACTED FROM QUARTER-TO-QUARTER BY DEMAND CHANGES IN CERTAIN MARKET SECTORS THAT CAN RESULT IN FLUCTUATING COSTS OF CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS AND COMMODITY-BASED COMPONENTS THAT ARE UTILIZED IN THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS. THE TIMING OF THE COMPANY'S PASS THROUGH OF INPUT COST INCREASES AND DECREASES TO ITS CUSTOMERS MAY NOT COINCIDE WITH THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH COSTS ARE INCURRED IN INVENTORY.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT DECREASED $2.1 MILLION, OR 2%, TO $112.7 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 FROM $114.8 MILLION IN 2018. FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, GROSS PROFIT INCREASED $6.7 MILLION, OR 3% TO $219.2 MILLION FROM $212.5 MILLION IN 2018. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT DECREASED TO 18.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 FROM 19.0% IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 AND DECREASED TO 17.9% FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 FROM 18.4% IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE CHANGES IN GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018 REFLECT THE IMPACT OF THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER \u201cCOST OF GOODS SOLD\u201d.  ECONOMIC OR INDUSTRY-WIDE FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR RV, MH, MARINE AND INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES INCLUDE THE COSTS OF COMMODITIES AND THE LABOR USED TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT CAN CAUSE GROSS MARGINS TO FLUCTUATE FROM QUARTER-TO-QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-YEAR.  MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS ARE THE PRIMARY FACTORS DETERMINING OUR COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD, AND ANY FUTURE INCREASES IN RAW MATERIAL OR LABOR COSTS WOULD IMPACT OUR PROFIT MARGINS NEGATIVELY IF WE WERE UNABLE TO RAISE THE SELLING PRICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS BY CORRESPONDING AMOUNTS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE GENERALLY BEEN ABLE TO PASS ALONG COST INCREASES TO CUSTOMERS.  WAREHOUSE AND DELIVERY EXPENSES  . WAREHOUSE AND DELIVERY EXPENSES INCREASED $7.6 MILLION, OR 40%, TO $26.3 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 FROM $18.7 MILLION IN 2018. FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS IN 2019, WAREHOUSE AND DELIVERY EXPENSES INCREASED $14.5 MILLION, OR 41%, TO $50.3 MILLION FROM $35.8 MILLION IN 2018. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, WAREHOUSE AND DELIVERY EXPENSES WERE 4.3% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO 3.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND 4.1% IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED TO 3.1% THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018. THE EXPENSE INCREASE IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED SALES VOLUMES AND TO THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN 2018 THAT HAD HIGHER WAREHOUSE AND DELIVERY EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WHEN COMPARED TO THE CONSOLIDATED PERCENTAGE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S SHIPMENTS TO THE OEMS IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 WERE GENERALLY LOWER VOLUME AND HIGHER FREQUENCY, AND AS A RESULT TRANSPORTATION COSTS RELATIVE TO SALES LEVELS OF PRODUCTS DELIVERED INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A) EXPENSES  . SG&A EXPENSES DECREASED $1.0 MILLION, OR 3%, TO $32.9 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 FROM $33.9 MILLION IN 2018. FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, SG&A EXPENSES INCREASED $4.9 MILLION, OR 7%, TO $70.6 MILLION FROM $65.7 MILLION IN 2018. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, SG&A EXPENSES WERE 5.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO 5.6% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND 5.8% IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED TO 5.7% IN 2018.  THE DECREASE IN SG&A EXPENSES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO 2018 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND SALES COMMISSIONS AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FEES. SG&A EXPENSE IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 ALSO REFLECTED THESE TWO FACTORS, WHICH WERE OFFSET BY: (I) THE IMPACT OF ADDITIONAL HEADCOUNT AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH RECENT ACQUISITIONS; (II) THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN AND COSTS RELATED TO AN EXPANSION OF CERTAIN LEADERSHIP ROLES TO SUPPORT OUR CONTINUED STRATEGIC GROWTH PLANS IN 2019 AND BEYOND; (III) THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN 2018 THAT HAD HIGHER SG&A EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WHEN COMPARED TO THE CONSOLIDATED PERCENTAGE AND (IV) THE COMPANY'S DECISION TO MAINTAIN A HIGHER OPERATING COST STRUCTURE COMPARED TO REVENUES THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 IN ANTICIPATION OF EXPECTED IMPROVING RETAIL DEMAND IN ALL FOUR OF OUR PRIMARY MARKETS.  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS DECREASED $0.9 MILLION, OR 10%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, AND INCREASED $1.0 MILLION, OR 6%, IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE DECREASE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF FINAL PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE IMPACT TO ASSOCIATED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. THE INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN 2018, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  29  OPERATING  INCOME.  OPERATING INCOME DECREASED $7.9 MILLION, OR 15%, TO $45.2 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 FROM $53.1 MILLION IN 2018. FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, OPERATING INCOME DECREASED $13.7 MILLION, OR 15%, TO $81.1 MILLION FROM $94.8 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, OPERATING INCOME WAS 7.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 VERSUS 8.8% IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 AND 6.6% FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 VERSUS 8.2% IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. OPERATING INCOME IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018 INCLUDED $7.2 MILLION AND $8.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018. THE CHANGE IN OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ITEMS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET.  INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $2.3 MILLION, OR 38%, TO $8.6 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 FROM $6.3 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $7.0 MILLION, OR 66%, TO $17.6 MILLION FROM $10.6 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE REFLECTS: (I) INCREASED BORROWINGS RELATED TO 2018 ACQUISITIONS AND (II) INCREASES IN THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON THE VARIABLE RATE PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT, WHICH REFLECTS INCREASES IN LIBOR IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS.  INCOME TAXES.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE DECREASED $2.7 MILLION, OR 23%, TO $9.2 MILLION FROM $11.9 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, INCOME TAX EXPENSE DECREASED $4.0 MILLION, OR 21%, TO $15.2 MILLION FROM $19.2 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 25.1% COMPARED TO 25.5% IN THE COMPARABLE 2018 PERIOD. FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 23.9% COMPARED TO 22.9% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE RECOGNITION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ON SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION THAT WERE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE UPON REALIZATION. AMOUNTS RECORDED INCLUDE $0.1 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND $0.1 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND $0.9 MILLION AND $2.2 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE SIX MONTH 2019 AND 2018 PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. WE ANTICIPATE OUR FULL YEAR 2019 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO BE BETWEEN 24% AND 25%. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT RELATING TO THE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS AND EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ONE-TIME TAX ITEMS, WE ANTICIPATE OUR FULL YEAR 2019 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO BE BETWEEN 25% AND 26%, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP METRIC. THE 1% DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GAAP AND NON-GAAP EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPACT OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS.  THE COMPANY'S COMBINED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND FOR THE FULL YEAR 2019 COULD FURTHER FLUCTUATE DUE TO: (I) REFINEMENTS IN FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX ESTIMATES, WHICH ARE IMPACTED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF TAX CREDITS; (II) PERMANENT DIFFERENCES IMPACTING THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE; (III) SHIFTS IN APPORTIONMENT FACTORS AMONG STATES AS A RESULT OF RECENT ACQUISITION ACTIVITY AND OTHER FACTORS AND (IV) THE TIMING OF THE RECOGNITION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE VESTING OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS AWARDS AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED.  NET INCOME.  NET INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WAS $27.4 MILLION, OR $1.18 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO $34.9 MILLION, OR $1.42 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR 2018. FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, NET INCOME WAS $48.3 MILLION, OR $2.07 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO $64.9 MILLION, OR $2.62 PER DILUTED SHARE. THE CHANGES IN NET INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR PERIODS REFLECT THE IMPACT OF THE ITEMS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED.  USE OF FINANCIAL METRICS  OUR MD&A INCLUDES FINANCIAL METRICS, SUCH AS RV, MARINE AND MH CONTENT PER UNIT, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT MEASURES OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. THESE METRICS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED ALTERNATIVES TO GAAP. OUR COMPUTATIONS OF CONTENT PER UNIT MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHERS. YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THESE METRICS IN ISOLATION OR AS SUBSTITUTES FOR AN ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP.

SUMMARY OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY'S EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER ITS 2018 CREDIT FACILITY ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET ANTICIPATED CASH NEEDS FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, EXCLUSIVE OF ANY ACQUISITIONS, BASED ON ITS CURRENT CASH FLOW BUDGETS AND FORECAST OF SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS.  THE ABILITY TO ACCESS UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE 2018 CREDIT FACILITY AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS DEPENDENT ON MAINTAINING COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS AS SPECIFIED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT ESTABLISHED THE 2018 CREDIT FACILITY (THE \"2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT\").  AS OF AND FOR THE  JUNE 30, 2019  REPORTING DATE, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS FINANCIAL DEBT COVENANTS AS REQUIRED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE REQUIRED MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO AND THE REQUIRED MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO COMPARED TO THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  AND FOR THE FISCAL PERIOD THEN ENDED ARE AS FOLLOWS.  33  REQUIRED  ACTUAL  CONSOLIDATED TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO (12-MONTH PERIOD)  3.00  2.46  CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO (12-MONTH PERIOD)  1.50  3.18  WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DEPENDING ON MANUFACTURING VOLUMES PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE RV, MH AND MARINE INDUSTRIES AS WELL AS THE INDUSTRIAL MARKETS WE SERVE, THE TIMING OF DELIVERIES, AND THE PAYMENT CYCLES OF CUSTOMERS. IN THE EVENT THAT OPERATING CASH FLOW IS INADEQUATE AND ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL RESOURCES WERE TO BECOME UNAVAILABLE, THE COMPANY WOULD SEEK TO REVISE ITS OPERATING STRATEGIES ACCORDINGLY. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS ITS LIQUIDITY POSITION AND POTENTIAL SOURCES OF SUPPLEMENTAL LIQUIDITY IN VIEW OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC AND CAPITAL MARKET CONDITIONS, AND OTHER RELEVANT CIRCUMSTANCES.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE 2018 REVOLVER AND THE 2018 TERM LOAN, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO VARIABLE RATES OF INTEREST, ARE SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM TOTAL BORROWING LIMIT OF $900.0 MILLION (EFFECTIVE JUNE 5, 2018). SEE NOTE 10 OF THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ON INTEREST RATE SWAPS USED TO PARTIALLY HEDGE VARIABLE INTEREST RATES UNDER THE 2018 REVOLVER AND 2018 TERM LOAN. THE UNUSED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE 2018 CREDIT FACILITY AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 WAS  $477.7  MILLION.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE MD&A AND NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  OTHER  SEASONALITY  MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN THE RV, MARINE AND MH INDUSTRIES HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN SEASONAL AND AT THEIR HIGHEST LEVELS WHEN THE WEATHER IS MODERATE. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND PROFITS HAD GENERALLY BEEN THE HIGHEST IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND LOWEST IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. SEASONAL INDUSTRY TRENDS IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE INCLUDED THE IMPACT RELATED TO THE ADDITION OF MAJOR RV MANUFACTURER OPEN HOUSES FOR DEALERS IN THE AUGUST/SEPTEMBER TIMEFRAME, RESULTING IN DEALERS DELAYING CERTAIN RESTOCKING PURCHASES UNTIL NEW PRODUCT LINES ARE INTRODUCED AT THESE SHOWS. IN ADDITION, CURRENT AND FUTURE SEASONAL INDUSTRY TRENDS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN IN PRIOR YEARS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF NATIONAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE ON RETAIL SALES OF RVS AND OTHER PRODUCTS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY SELLS ITS COMPONENTS, TIMING OF DEALER ORDERS, FLUCTUATIONS IN DEALER INVENTORIES, AND FROM TIME TO TIME, THE IMPACT OF SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS ON THE TIMING OF INDUSTRY-WIDE WHOLESALE SHIPMENTS.

ON AN UNCONSOLIDATED BASIS, EXCLUDING THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS IS OPERATED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. THE COMPANY ISSUES PUBLIC EQUITY FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT DOES NOT OTHERWISE GENERATE ANY CAPITAL ITSELF OR CONDUCT ANY BUSINESS ITSELF, OTHER THAN INCURRING CERTAIN EXPENSES IN OPERATING AS A PUBLIC COMPANY, WHICH ARE FULLY REIMBURSED BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD ANY INDEBTEDNESS, AND ITS ONLY MATERIAL ASSET IS ITS OWNERSHIP OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  THE COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL FUNDING REQUIREMENT IS THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON SHARES. THE COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ITS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IS DISTRIBUTIONS IT RECEIVES FROM THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  THROUGH ITS OWNERSHIP OF THE SOLE GENERAL PARTNER OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, THE COMPANY HAS THE FULL, EXCLUSIVE AND COMPLETE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL. THE COMPANY CAUSES THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO DISTRIBUTE ALL, OR SUCH PORTION AS THE COMPANY MAY IN ITS DISCRETION DETERMINE, OF ITS AVAILABLE CASH IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY RECEIVES PROCEEDS FROM EQUITY ISSUANCES FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT IS REQUIRED BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT TO CONTRIBUTE THE PROCEEDS FROM ITS EQUITY ISSUANCES TO THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP IN EXCHANGE FOR PARTNERSHIP UNITS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  WE ARE A WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER WITH A SHELF REGISTRATION THAT EXPIRES IN MARCH 2021 THAT ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO REGISTER UNSPECIFIED VARIOUS CLASSES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO REGISTER UNSPECIFIED, VARIOUS CLASSES OF DEBT SECURITIES.  AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE EQUITY FROM TIME TO TIME ON AN OPPORTUNISTIC BASIS, DEPENDENT UPON MARKET CONDITIONS AND AVAILABLE PRICING. THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP MAY USE THE PROCEEDS TO REPAY DEBT, INCLUDING BORROWINGS UNDER ITS LINES OF CREDIT, TO DEVELOP NEW OR EXISTING PROPERTIES, TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS OF PROPERTIES OR PORTFOLIOS OF PROPERTIES, TO INVEST IN EXISTING OR NEWLY CREATED JOINT VENTURES OR FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  THE LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S ABILITY TO MAKE SUFFICIENT DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY. THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP IS A PARTY TO LOAN AGREEMENTS WITH VARIOUS BANK LENDERS THAT REQUIRE THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO COMPLY WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS BEFORE IT MAY MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY.  THE COMPANY ALSO GUARANTEES SOME OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S DEBT. IF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP FAILS TO FULFILL ITS DEBT REQUIREMENTS, WHICH TRIGGER THE COMPANY\u2019S GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS, THEN THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL ITS CASH PAYMENT COMMITMENTS UNDER SUCH GUARANTEES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY\u2019S ONLY MATERIAL ASSET IS ITS INVESTMENT IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S SOURCES OF WORKING CAPITAL, SPECIFICALLY ITS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER ITS UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT, ARE ADEQUATE FOR IT TO MAKE ITS DISTRIBUTION PAYMENTS TO THE COMPANY AND, IN TURN, FOR THE COMPANY TO MAKE ITS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND TO FINANCE ITS CONTINUED OPERATIONS, GROWTH STRATEGY AND ADDITIONAL EXPENSES WE EXPECT TO INCUR FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S SOURCES OF CAPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE AT ALL OR IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS NEEDS, INCLUDING ITS ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTION PAYMENTS TO THE COMPANY. THE UNAVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S ABILITY TO PAY ITS DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY WHICH WILL, IN TURN, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS.  FOR THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN ITS QUALIFICATION AS A REIT, IT MUST PAY DIVIDENDS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS AGGREGATING ANNUALLY AT LEAST 90% OF ITS TAXABLE INCOME (EXCLUDING CAPITAL GAINS).  WHILE HISTORICALLY THE COMPANY HAS SATISFIED THIS DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT BY MAKING CASH DISTRIBUTIONS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS, IT MAY CHOOSE TO SATISFY THIS REQUIREMENT BY MAKING DISTRIBUTIONS OF CASH OR OTHER PROPERTY, INCLUDING, IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY\u2019S OWN SHARES.  AS A RESULT OF THIS DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP CANNOT RELY ON RETAINED EARNINGS TO FUND ITS ON-GOING OPERATIONS TO THE SAME EXTENT THAT OTHER COMPANIES WHOSE PARENT COMPANIES ARE NOT REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS CAN. THE COMPANY MAY NEED TO CONTINUE TO RAISE CAPITAL IN THE EQUITY MARKETS TO FUND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL NEW DEVELOPMENTS, EXPANSIONS AND RENOVATIONS OF EXISTING PROPERTIES, ACQUISITIONS, OR INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING OR NEWLY CREATED JOINT VENTURES.  49  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY CONSOLIDATES THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE IT HAS (1) THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND (2) THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE RESIDUAL RETURNS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OTHER THAN ITS INVESTMENT IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. THEREFORE, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF THE COMPANY AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP ARE THE SAME ON THEIR RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, EXCEPT FOR IMMATERIAL DIFFERENCES RELATED TO CASH, OTHER ASSETS AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES THAT ARISE FROM PUBLIC COMPANY EXPENSES PAID BY THE COMPANY. HOWEVER, ALL DEBT IS HELD DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AT THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP LEVEL, AND THE COMPANY HAS GUARANTEED SOME OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S UNSECURED DEBT AS DISCUSSED BELOW. BECAUSE THE COMPANY CONSOLIDATES THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u201d SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS SECTION TO UNDERSTAND THE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AND HOW THE COMPANY IS OPERATED AS A WHOLE.  IN MAY 2017, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO  $125.0 MILLION  OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES AS MARKET CONDITIONS WARRANT OVER A PERIOD COMMENCING ON MAY 19, 2017 AND EXPIRING ON MAY 18, 2019.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE REMAINING AMOUNT AUTHORIZED TO BE REPURCHASED UNDER THE PROGRAM WAS APPROXIMATELY  $55.7 MILLION.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $44.3 MILLION  OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES FOR A TOTAL REMAINING AUTHORIZED AMOUNT OF  $100.0 MILLION  . THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ALSO EXTENDED THE EXPIRATION OF THE EXISTING PLAN BY  TWO  YEARS TO MAY 2021. REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH OPEN MARKET, PRIVATELY-NEGOTIATED, STRUCTURED OR DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS (INCLUDING ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS), OR OTHER METHODS OF ACQUIRING SHARES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO STRUCTURE OPEN MARKET PURCHASES TO OCCUR WITHIN PRICING AND VOLUME REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 10B-18.  THE COMPANY MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, ENTER INTO RULE 10B5-1 PLANS TO FACILITATE THE REPURCHASE OF ITS SHARES UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION.  SHARES REPURCHASED WERE AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019  2018  2019  2018  TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES PURCHASED  558,399  475,549  558,399  919,249  AVERAGE PRICE PAID PER SHARE  $17.89  $21.01  $17.89  $21.74  TOTAL PRICE PAID EXCLUSIVE OF COMMISSIONS AND RELATED FEES (IN THOUSANDS)  $9,989  $9,990  $9,989  $19,980  THE REMAINING AMOUNT AUTHORIZED TO BE REPURCHASED UNDER THE PROGRAM AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  WAS APPROXIMATELY  $90.0 MILLION  .  FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE \u201cITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\u201d IN PART II OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  IN JULY 2019, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A  $0.355  CASH DIVIDEND PER COMMON SHARE PAYABLE ON AUGUST 15, 2019 TO EACH SHAREHOLDER OF RECORD ON JULY 31, 2019, AND THE TRUSTEES OF TANGER GP TRUST DECLARED A  $0.355  CASH DISTRIBUTION PER OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UNIT TO THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP'S UNITHOLDERS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP  GENERAL OVERVIEW  IN THIS \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u201d SECTION, THE TERMS \u201cWE\u201d, \u201cOUR\u201d AND \u201cUS\u201d REFER TO THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP OR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND THE COMPANY TOGETHER, AS THE TEXT REQUIRES.  PROPERTY RENTAL INCOME REPRESENTS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE TO PAY PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, DEBT SERVICE, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND DISTRIBUTIONS, EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ACQUISITIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER SUCH NON-RECURRING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ACQUISITIONS, WE FINANCE SUCH ACTIVITIES FROM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT OR FROM THE PROCEEDS FROM THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S DEBT OFFERINGS AND THE COMPANY\u2019S EQUITY OFFERINGS.  50  WE BELIEVE WE ACHIEVE A STRONG AND FLEXIBLE FINANCIAL POSITION BY ATTEMPTING TO: (1) MAINTAIN A CONSERVATIVE LEVERAGE POSITION RELATIVE TO OUR PORTFOLIO WHEN PURSUING NEW DEVELOPMENT, EXPANSION AND ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES, (2) EXTEND AND SEQUENCE DEBT MATURITIES, (3) MANAGE OUR INTEREST RATE RISK THROUGH A PROPER MIX OF FIXED AND VARIABLE RATE DEBT, (4) MAINTAIN ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY BY USING OUR UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT IN A CONSERVATIVE MANNER AND (5) PRESERVE INTERNALLY GENERATED SOURCES OF CAPITAL BY STRATEGICALLY DIVESTING OF UNDERPERFORMING ASSETS AND MAINTAINING A CONSERVATIVE DISTRIBUTION PAYOUT RATIO. WE MANAGE OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE TO REFLECT A LONG TERM INVESTMENT APPROACH AND UTILIZE MULTIPLE SOURCES OF CAPITAL TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH OUR CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019  2018  CHANGE  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $92,779  $115,292  $(22,513  )  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES  116,331  (28,701  )  145,032  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (210,740  )  (88,453  )  (122,287  )  EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE CHANGES ON CASH AND EQUIVALENTS  (16  )  (53  )  37  NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $(1,646  )  $(1,915  )  $269  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  THE DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE 2019 PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN WORKING CAPITAL AND DUE TO THE SALE OF OUR NAGS HEAD, OCEAN CITY, PARK CITY AND WILLIAMSBURG OUTLET CENTERS IN MARCH 2019.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THE PRIMARY CAUSE FOR THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO THE NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY  $128.2 MILLION  FROM THE SALE OF OUR NAGS HEAD, OCEAN CITY, PARK CITY AND WILLIAMSBURG OUTLET CENTERS  IN THE 2019 PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE 2019 PERIOD HAD LOWER LEVELS OF DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY THAN THE 2018 PERIOD.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  THE PRIMARY CAUSE FOR THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO THE USE OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF OUR NAGS HEAD, OCEAN CITY, PARK CITY AND WILLIAMSBURG OUTLET CENTERS TO PAY DOWN OUR UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT.  IN ADDITION, DURING THE 2019 PERIOD, WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY $10.0 MILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES AS COMPARED TO REPURCHASING APPROXIMATELY $20.0 MILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES IN THE 2018 PERIOD.  51  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE DETAILS OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (IN THOUSANDS).  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019  2018  CHANGE  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ANALYSIS.  NEW OUTLET CENTER DEVELOPMENTS AND EXPANSIONS  $4,010  $5,285  $(1,275  )  MAJOR OUTLET CENTER RENOVATIONS  290  1,786  (1,496  )  SECOND GENERATION TENANT ALLOWANCES  6,050  8,326  (2,276  )  OTHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  10,293  9,134  1,159  20,643  24,531  (3,888  )  CONVERSION FROM ACCRUAL TO CASH BASIS  1,759  16,681  (14,922  )  ADDITIONS TO RENTAL PROPERTY-CASH BASIS  $22,402  $41,212  $(18,810  )  POTENTIAL FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS FILING, WE ARE IN THE INITIAL STUDY PERIOD FOR POTENTIAL NEW DEVELOPMENTS.  WE MAY ALSO USE JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS TO DEVELOP OTHER POTENTIAL SITES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT THESE POTENTIAL FUTURE PROJECTS WILL ULTIMATELY BE DEVELOPED.  IN THE CASE OF PROJECTS TO BE WHOLLY-OWNED BY US, WE EXPECT TO FUND THESE PROJECTS FROM AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT, BUT MAY ALSO FUND THEM WITH CAPITAL FROM ADDITIONAL PUBLIC DEBT AND EQUITY OFFERINGS.  FOR PROJECTS TO BE DEVELOPED THROUGH JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS, WE MAY USE COLLATERALIZED CONSTRUCTION LOANS TO FUND A PORTION OF THE PROJECT, WITH OUR SHARE OF THE EQUITY REQUIREMENTS FUNDED FROM SOURCES DESCRIBED ABOVE. SEE \u201cOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\u201d FOR A DISCUSSION OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.  WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR PORTFOLIO BY DEVELOPING, EXPANDING OR ACQUIRING ADDITIONAL OUTLET CENTERS. HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT ANY DEVELOPMENTS OR EXPANSIONS THAT WE, OR A JOINT VENTURE THAT WE HAVE AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN, HAVE PLANNED OR ANTICIPATED MAY NOT BE STARTED OR COMPLETED AS SCHEDULED, OR MAY NOT RESULT IN ACCRETIVE NET INCOME OR FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cFFO\u201d).  SEE THE SECTION \u201cNON-GAAP SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS MEASURES - FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS\u201d BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF FFO.  IN ADDITION, WE REGULARLY EVALUATE ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION PROPOSALS AND ENGAGE FROM TIME TO TIME IN NEGOTIATIONS FOR ACQUISITIONS OR DISPOSITIONS OF PROPERTIES. WE MAY ALSO ENTER INTO LETTERS OF INTENT FOR THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF PROPERTIES. ANY PROSPECTIVE ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION THAT IS BEING EVALUATED OR WHICH IS SUBJECT TO A LETTER OF INTENT MAY NOT BE CONSUMMATED, OR IF CONSUMMATED, MAY NOT RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN EARNINGS OR LIQUIDITY.  FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , UNSECURED BORROWINGS REPRESENTED  95%  OF OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT AND  92%  OF THE GROSS BOOK VALUE OF OUR REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO WAS UNENCUMBERED. THE COMPANY GUARANTEES THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S OBLIGATIONS  UNDER OUR LINES OF CREDIT. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE HAD  $581.3 MILLION  AVAILABLE UNDER OUR UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT OF  $170,000.  52  WE INTEND TO RETAIN THE ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, INCLUDING PUBLIC DEBT OR EQUITY, TO PURSUE ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY ARISE AND TO OTHERWISE ACT IN A MANNER THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND UNITHOLDERS.  THE COMPANY IS A WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER WITH A JOINT SHELF REGISTRATION ON FORM S-3 WITH THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, EXPIRING IN MARCH 2021, THAT ALLOWS US TO REGISTER UNSPECIFIED AMOUNTS OF DIFFERENT CLASSES OF SECURITIES.  TO GENERATE CAPITAL TO REINVEST INTO OTHER ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, WE MAY ALSO CONSIDER THE USE OF ADDITIONAL OPERATIONAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL JOINT VENTURES, THE SALE OR LEASE OF OUTPARCELS ON OUR EXISTING PROPERTIES AND THE SALE OF CERTAIN PROPERTIES THAT DO NOT MEET OUR LONG-TERM INVESTMENT CRITERIA. BASED ON CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS, EXISTING LINES OF CREDIT, ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS WITH CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO SELL DEBT OR ISSUE EQUITY SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE NECESSARY FINANCING TO FUND THE PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT ADEQUATE CASH WILL BE AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR OPERATING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, REGULAR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS, AND THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH REIT REQUIREMENTS IN BOTH THE SHORT AND LONG-TERM.  ALTHOUGH WE RECEIVE MOST OF OUR RENTAL PAYMENTS ON A MONTHLY BASIS, DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS AND UNITHOLDERS ARE MADE QUARTERLY AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE SENIOR, UNSECURED NOTES ARE MADE SEMI-ANNUALLY. AMOUNTS ACCUMULATED FOR SUCH PAYMENTS WILL BE USED IN THE INTERIM TO REDUCE THE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR EXISTING UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT OR INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM MONEY MARKET OR OTHER SUITABLE INSTRUMENTS.  WE BELIEVE OUR CURRENT BALANCE SHEET POSITION IS FINANCIALLY SOUND; HOWEVER, DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY AND UNPREDICTABILITY OF THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS, WE CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCE THAT AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO CAPITAL WILL EXIST BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN OUR NEXT SIGNIFICANT DEBT MATURES, WHICH IS OUR UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT. THE UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT EXPIRE IN 2021, WITH A ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OPTION THAT MAY EXTEND THE MATURITY TO 2022.  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT, WHICH PROVIDE FOR BORROWINGS UP TO  $600.0 MILLION  , TOTALED  $18.5 MILLION.  THE INTEREST RATE SPREADS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT AND OUR UNSECURED TERM LOAN ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING.  IF OUR CREDIT RATING IS DOWNGRADED OR UPGRADED, OUR INTEREST RATE SPREAD WOULD ADJUST ACCORDINGLY.  THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S DEBT AGREEMENTS REQUIRE THE MAINTENANCE OF CERTAIN RATIOS, INCLUDING DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE, AND LIMIT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS SUCH THAT DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS WILL NOT EXCEED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, AS DEFINED IN THE AGREEMENTS, FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR 95% ON A CUMULATIVE BASIS. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN AND CURRENTLY ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF OUR DEBT COVENANTS. WE EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF OUR EXISTING DEBT COVENANTS; HOWEVER, SHOULD CIRCUMSTANCES ARISE THAT WOULD CAUSE US TO BE IN DEFAULT, THE VARIOUS LENDERS WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCELERATE THE MATURITY ON OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT.  WE BELIEVE OUR MOST RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS ARE CONTAINED IN OUR SENIOR, UNSECURED NOTES. KEY FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND THEIR COVENANT LEVELS, WHICH ARE CALCULATED BASED ON CONTRACTUAL TERMS, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES FINANCIAL COVENANTS  REQUIRED  ACTUAL  TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DEBT TO ADJUSTED TOTAL ASSETS  <60%  49%  TOTAL SECURED DEBT TO ADJUSTED TOTAL ASSETS  <40%  3%  TOTAL UNENCUMBERED ASSETS TO UNSECURED DEBT  >150%  197%  53  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE PARTIAL OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN  7  UNCONSOLIDATED OUTLET CENTERS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  2.2 MILLION  SQUARE FEET, INCLUDING  3  OUTLET CENTERS IN CANADA. SEE NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DETAILS OF OUR INDIVIDUAL JOINT VENTURES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CARRYING VALUES OF OUR INVESTMENTS, FEES WE RECEIVE FOR SERVICES PROVIDED TO THE JOINT VENTURES, RECENT DEVELOPMENT AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AND CONDENSED COMBINED SUMMARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  WE MAY ELECT TO FUND CASH NEEDS OF A JOINT VENTURE THROUGH EQUITY CONTRIBUTIONS (GENERALLY ON A BASIS PROPORTIONATE TO OUR OWNERSHIP INTERESTS), ADVANCES OR PARTNER LOANS, ALTHOUGH SUCH FUNDING IS NOT TYPICALLY REQUIRED CONTRACTUALLY OR OTHERWISE. WE SEPARATELY REPORT INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES FOR WHICH ACCUMULATED DISTRIBUTIONS HAVE EXCEEDED INVESTMENTS IN, AND OUR SHARE OF NET INCOME OR LOSS OF, THE JOINT VENTURES WITHIN OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS BECAUSE WE ARE COMMITTED AND INTEND TO PROVIDE FURTHER FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THESE JOINT VENTURES. WE BELIEVE OUR JOINT VENTURES WILL BE ABLE TO FUND THEIR OPERATING AND CAPITAL NEEDS DURING 2019 BASED ON THEIR SOURCES OF WORKING CAPITAL, SPECIFICALLY CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, ACCESS TO CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PARTNERS, AND ABILITY TO REFINANCE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE UPCOMING EXTENSIONS OF NEAR TERM MATURITIES.  OUR JOINT VENTURES ARE TYPICALLY ENCUMBERED BY A MORTGAGE ON THE JOINT VENTURE PROPERTY. WE PROVIDE GUARANTEES TO LENDERS FOR OUR JOINT VENTURES WHICH INCLUDE STANDARD NON-RECOURSE CARVE OUT INDEMNIFICATIONS FOR LOSSES ARISING FROM ITEMS SUCH AS BUT NOT LIMITED TO FRAUD, PHYSICAL WASTE, PAYMENT OF TAXES, ENVIRONMENTAL INDEMNITIES, MISAPPLICATION OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS OR SECURITY DEPOSITS AND FAILURE TO MAINTAIN REQUIRED INSURANCE. A DEFAULT BY A JOINT VENTURE UNDER ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS MAY EXPOSE US TO LIABILITY UNDER THE GUARANTY. FOR CONSTRUCTION AND MORTGAGE LOANS, WE MAY INCLUDE A GUARANTY OF COMPLETION AS WELL AS A PRINCIPAL GUARANTY RANGING FROM  5%  TO  100%  OF PRINCIPAL.  THE PRINCIPAL GUARANTEES INCLUDE TERMS FOR RELEASE BASED UPON SATISFACTORY COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION AND PERFORMANCE TARGETS INCLUDING OCCUPANCY THRESHOLDS AND MINIMUM DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE TESTS. OUR JOINT VENTURES MAY CONTAIN MAKE WHOLE PROVISIONS IN THE EVENT THAT DEMANDS ARE MADE ON ANY EXISTING GUARANTEES.  RIOCAN CANADA  IN MAY 2019, THE RIOCAN JOINT VENTURE CLOSED ON THE SALE OF ITS OUTLET CENTER IN BROMONT, FOR NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY  $6.4 MILLION  . OUR SHARE OF THE PROCEEDS WAS APPROXIMATELY  $3.2 MILLION  . AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSACTION, WE RECORDED A FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY  $3.6 MILLION  IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  DEBT OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE DETAILS INFORMATION REGARDING THE OUTSTANDING DEBT OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES AND GUARANTEES OF SUCH DEBT PROVIDED BY US AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS).

THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THESE POLICIES IN  2019  , OTHER THAN THE ADOPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION TOPIC 842, LEASES, DESCRIBED IN NOTE 17 -LEASES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART I, ITEM I OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  55  NON-GAAP SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cFFO\u201d) IS A WIDELY USED MEASURE OF THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR REAL ESTATE COMPANIES THAT SUPPLEMENTS NET INCOME (LOSS) DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  WE DETERMINE FFO BASED ON THE DEFINITION SET FORTH BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\u201cNAREIT\u201d), OF WHICH WE ARE A MEMBER.  IN DECEMBER 2018, NAREIT ISSUED \u201cNAREIT FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS WHITE PAPER - 2018 RESTATEMENT\u201d WHICH CLARIFIES, WHERE NECESSARY, EXISTING GUIDANCE AND CONSOLIDATES ALERTS AND POLICY BULLETINS INTO A SINGLE DOCUMENT FOR EASE OF USE. NAREIT DEFINES FFO AS NET INCOME/(LOSS) AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cGAAP\u201d), EXCLUDING (I) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION RELATED TO REAL ESTATE, (II) GAINS OR LOSSES FROM SALES OF CERTAIN REAL ESTATE ASSETS, (III) GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGE IN CONTROL, (IV) IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS OF CERTAIN REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES WHEN THE IMPAIRMENT IS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF DEPRECIABLE REAL ESTATE HELD BY THE ENTITY AND (V) AFTER ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES CALCULATED TO REFLECT FFO ON THE SAME BASIS.  FFO IS INTENDED TO EXCLUDE HISTORICAL COST DEPRECIATION OF REAL ESTATE AS REQUIRED BY GAAP WHICH ASSUMES THAT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS DIMINISHES RATABLY OVER TIME. HISTORICALLY, HOWEVER, REAL ESTATE VALUES HAVE RISEN OR FALLEN WITH MARKET CONDITIONS. BECAUSE FFO EXCLUDES DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS, GAINS AND LOSSES FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS AND EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS, IT PROVIDES A PERFORMANCE MEASURE THAT, WHEN COMPARED YEAR OVER YEAR, REFLECTS THE IMPACT TO OPERATIONS FROM TRENDS IN OCCUPANCY RATES, RENTAL RATES, OPERATING COSTS, DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND INTEREST COSTS, PROVIDING PERSPECTIVE NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT FROM NET INCOME.  WE PRESENT FFO BECAUSE WE CONSIDER IT AN IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  IN ADDITION, A PORTION OF CASH BONUS COMPENSATION TO CERTAIN MEMBERS OF MANAGEMENT IS BASED ON OUR FFO OR ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cAFFO\u201d), WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN THE SECTION BELOW. WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO HAVE ENHANCED TRANSPARENCY INTO HOW WE EVALUATE OUR PERFORMANCE AND THAT OF OUR MANAGEMENT.  IN ADDITION, FFO IS FREQUENTLY USED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS, INVESTORS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES IN THE EVALUATION OF REITS, MANY OF WHICH PRESENT FFO WHEN REPORTING THEIR RESULTS. FFO IS ALSO WIDELY USED BY US AND OTHERS IN OUR INDUSTRY TO EVALUATE AND PRICE POTENTIAL ACQUISITION CANDIDATES.  WE BELIEVE THAT FFO PAYOUT RATIO, WHICH REPRESENTS REGULAR DISTRIBUTIONS TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND UNIT HOLDERS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF FFO, IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT FACILITATES THE COMPARISON OF DIVIDEND COVERAGE BETWEEN REITS.  NAREIT HAS ENCOURAGED ITS MEMBER COMPANIES TO REPORT THEIR FFO AS A SUPPLEMENTAL, INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARD MEASURE OF REIT OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  FFO HAS SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL, AND YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER IT IN ISOLATION, OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP. SOME OF THESE LIMITATIONS ARE.  \u2022  FFO DOES NOT REFLECT OUR CASH EXPENDITURES, OR FUTURE REQUIREMENTS, FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS;  \u2022  FFO DOES NOT REFLECT CHANGES IN, OR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR, OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS;  \u2022  ALTHOUGH DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ARE NON-CASH CHARGES, THE ASSETS BEING DEPRECIATED AND AMORTIZED WILL OFTEN HAVE TO BE REPLACED IN THE FUTURE, AND FFO DOES NOT REFLECT ANY CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH REPLACEMENTS; AND  \u2022  OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY MAY CALCULATE FFO DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO, LIMITING ITS USEFULNESS AS A COMPARATIVE MEASURE.  BECAUSE OF THESE LIMITATIONS, FFO SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A MEASURE OF DISCRETIONARY CASH AVAILABLE TO US TO INVEST IN THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS OR OUR DIVIDEND PAYING CAPACITY. WE COMPENSATE FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY RELYING PRIMARILY ON OUR GAAP RESULTS AND USING FFO ONLY AS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE.  56  ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS  WE PRESENT AFFO AS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OUR PERFORMANCE.  WE DEFINE AFFO AS FFO FURTHER ADJUSTED TO ELIMINATE THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN ITEMS THAT WE DO NOT CONSIDER INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  THESE FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS ARE ITEMIZED IN THE TABLE BELOW.  YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO EVALUATE THESE ADJUSTMENTS AND THE REASONS WE CONSIDER THEM APPROPRIATE FOR SUPPLEMENTAL ANALYSIS. IN EVALUATING AFFO YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN THE FUTURE WE MAY INCUR EXPENSES THAT ARE THE SAME AS OR SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THIS PRESENTATION. OUR PRESENTATION OF AFFO SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN INFERENCE THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY UNUSUAL OR NON-RECURRING ITEMS.  WE PRESENT AFFO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT ASSISTS INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS IN COMPARING OUR PERFORMANCE ACROSS REPORTING PERIODS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS BY EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO HAVE ENHANCED TRANSPARENCY INTO HOW WE EVALUATE MANAGEMENT\u2019S PERFORMANCE AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES.  WE USE AFFO WHEN CERTAIN MATERIAL, UNPLANNED TRANSACTIONS OCCUR AS A FACTOR IN EVALUATING MANAGEMENT\u2019S PERFORMANCE AND TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES, AND MAY USE AFFO WHEN DETERMINING INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  AFFO HAS LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL. SOME OF THESE LIMITATIONS ARE.  \u2022  AFFO DOES NOT REFLECT OUR CASH EXPENDITURES, OR FUTURE REQUIREMENTS, FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS;  \u2022  AFFO DOES NOT REFLECT CHANGES IN, OR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR, OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS;  \u2022  ALTHOUGH DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ARE NON-CASH CHARGES, THE ASSETS BEING DEPRECIATED AND AMORTIZED WILL OFTEN HAVE TO BE REPLACED IN THE FUTURE, AND AFFO DOES NOT REFLECT ANY CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH REPLACEMENTS;  \u2022  AFFO DOES NOT REFLECT THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN CASH CHARGES RESULTING FROM MATTERS WE CONSIDER NOT TO BE INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS; AND  \u2022  OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY MAY CALCULATE AFFO DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO, LIMITING ITS USEFULNESS AS A COMPARATIVE MEASURE.  BECAUSE OF THESE LIMITATIONS, AFFO SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PERFORMANCE MEASURES CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE COMPENSATE FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY RELYING PRIMARILY ON OUR GAAP RESULTS AND USING AFFO ONLY AS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE.  57  BELOW IS A RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND AFFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS).

PORTFOLIO NOI REPRESENTS OUR PROPERTY LEVEL NET OPERATING INCOME WHICH IS DEFINED AS TOTAL OPERATING REVENUES LESS PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES AND EXCLUDES TERMINATION FEES AND NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDING STRAIGHT-LINE RENT, NET ABOVE AND BELOW MARKET RENT AMORTIZATION AND GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE OF OUTPARCELS RECOGNIZED DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. WE DEFINE SAME CENTER NOI AS PORTFOLIO NOI FOR THE PROPERTIES THAT WERE OPERATIONAL FOR THE ENTIRE PORTION OF BOTH COMPARABLE REPORTING PERIODS AND WHICH WERE NOT ACQUIRED OR SUBJECT TO A MATERIAL EXPANSION OR NON-RECURRING EVENT, SUCH AS A NATURAL DISASTER, DURING THE COMPARABLE REPORTING PERIODS.  58  WE BELIEVE PORTFOLIO NOI AND SAME CENTER NOI ARE NON-GAAP METRICS USED BY INDUSTRY ANALYSTS, INVESTORS AND MANAGEMENT TO MEASURE THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPERTIES BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE PERFORMANCE MEASURES DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE REVENUES AND EXPENSES INVOLVED IN OWNING AND OPERATING REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND PROVIDE A PERSPECTIVE NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT FROM NET INCOME, FFO OR AFFO.  BECAUSE SAME CENTER NOI EXCLUDES PROPERTIES DEVELOPED, REDEVELOPED, ACQUIRED AND SOLD; AS WELL AS NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS, GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE OF OUTPARCELS AND TERMINATION RENTS; IT HIGHLIGHTS OPERATING TRENDS SUCH AS OCCUPANCY LEVELS, RENTAL RATES AND OPERATING COSTS ON PROPERTIES THAT WERE OPERATIONAL FOR BOTH COMPARABLE PERIODS. OTHER REITS MAY USE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES FOR CALCULATING PORTFOLIO NOI AND SAME CENTER NOI, AND ACCORDINGLY, OUR PORTFOLIO NOI AND SAME CENTER NOI MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER REITS.  PORTFOLIO NOI AND SAME CENTER NOI SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME (LOSS) OR AS AN INDICATOR OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SINCE THEY DO NOT REFLECT THE ENTIRE OPERATIONS OF OUR PORTFOLIO, NOR DO THEY REFLECT THE IMPACT OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, ACQUISITION-RELATED EXPENSES, INTEREST EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION COSTS, OTHER NON-PROPERTY INCOME AND LOSSES, THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASING COSTS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPERTIES, OR TRENDS IN DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC COSTS AND ACTIVITIES THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS. BECAUSE OF THESE LIMITATIONS, PORTFOLIO NOI AND SAME CENTER NOI SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PERFORMANCE MEASURES CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE COMPENSATE FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY RELYING PRIMARILY ON OUR GAAP RESULTS AND USING PORTFOLIO NOI AND SAME CENTER NOI ONLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES.  BELOW IS A RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO PORTFOLIO NOI AND SAME CENTER NOI FOR THE CONSOLIDATED PORTFOLIO (IN THOUSANDS).

(2)  EXCLUDED FROM SAME CENTER NOI.  OUTLET CENTERS SOLD.  NAGS HEAD, OCEAN CITY, PARK CITY, AND WILLIAMSBURG  MARCH 2019  59  ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK  THE MAJORITY OF OUR LEASES CONTAIN PROVISIONS DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF INFLATION. SUCH PROVISIONS INCLUDE CLAUSES FOR THE ESCALATION OF BASE RENT AND CLAUSES ENABLING US TO RECEIVE PERCENTAGE RENTALS BASED ON TENANTS\u2019 GROSS SALES (ABOVE PREDETERMINED LEVELS) WHICH GENERALLY INCREASE AS PRICES RISE. A COMPONENT OF MOST LEASES INCLUDES A PRO-RATA SHARE OR ESCALATING FIXED CONTRIBUTIONS BY THE TENANT FOR PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, INCLUDING COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE, REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE AND ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION, THEREBY REDUCING EXPOSURE TO INCREASES IN COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES RESULTING FROM INFLATION.  A PORTION OF OUR RENTAL REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM RENTS THAT DIRECTLY DEPEND ON THE SALES VOLUME OF CERTAIN TENANTS. ACCORDINGLY, DECLINES IN THESE TENANTS\u2019 SALES WOULD REDUCE THE INCOME PRODUCED BY OUR PROPERTIES. IF THE SALES OR PROFITABILITY OF OUR RETAIL TENANTS DECLINE SUFFICIENTLY, WHETHER DUE TO A CHANGE IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES, LEGISLATIVE CHANGES THAT INCREASE THE COST OF THEIR OPERATIONS OR OTHERWISE, SUCH TENANTS MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY THEIR EXISTING RENTS AS SUCH RENTS WOULD REPRESENT A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR SALES.  THE CURRENT CHALLENGING RETAIL ENVIRONMENT COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS IN THE SHORT-TERM AS OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR RETAIL TENANTS. WHILE WE BELIEVE OUTLET STORES WILL CONTINUE TO BE A PROFITABLE AND FUNDAMENTAL DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL FOR MANY BRAND NAME MANUFACTURERS, SOME RETAIL FORMATS ARE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN OTHERS. AS IS TYPICAL IN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY, CERTAIN TENANTS HAVE CLOSED, OR WILL CLOSE, CERTAIN STORES BY TERMINATING THEIR LEASE PRIOR TO ITS NATURAL EXPIRATION OR AS A RESULT OF FILING FOR PROTECTION UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAWS, OR MAY REQUEST MODIFICATIONS TO THEIR EXISTING LEASE TERMS. DURING 2018, FIVE OF OUR TENANTS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION AND DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THREE MORE OF OUR TENANTS HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION. LARGELY DUE TO THE NUMBER OF BANKRUPTCY FILINGS, STORE CLOSINGS AND RENT ADJUSTMENTS IN 2018 AND 2019, ALONG WITH THE EXPECTATIONS OF POSSIBLE FURTHER BANKRUPTCIES, BRAND-WIDE RESTRUCTURINGS BY RETAILERS AND POTENTIAL SELECT RENT ADJUSTMENTS IN 2019, WE CURRENTLY EXPECT OUR SAME CENTER NOI FOR 2019 TO DECLINE COMPARED TO 2018.  IF THE COMBINED LEVEL OF BANKRUPTCY FILINGS, STORE CLOSINGS AND RENT ADJUSTMENTS DURING 2019 ARE A GREATER LEVEL THAN WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE, OUR 2019 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SAME CENTER NOI COULD BE FURTHER NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.  DUE TO THE RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM NATURE OF OUR TENANTS\u2019 LEASES, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE LEASES IN OUR PORTFOLIO COME UP FOR RENEWAL EACH YEAR.  AS OF JANUARY 1,  2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  1.3 MILLION  SQUARE FEET, OR  11%  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED PORTFOLIO AT THAT TIME COMING UP FOR RENEWAL DURING  2019  , EXCLUDING THE OUTLET CENTERS SOLD IN MARCH 2019.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE HAD RENEWED APPROXIMATELY  66%  OF THIS SPACE. IN ADDITION, FOR THE ROLLING TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE COMPLETED RENEWALS AND RE-TENANTED SPACE TOTALING  1.6 MILLION  SQUARE FEET AT A BLENDED  3.5%  INCREASE IN AVERAGE BASE RENTAL RATES COMPARED TO THE EXPIRING RATES. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN ADDITIONAL TENANTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE SIMILAR BASE RENTAL RATES.  IN ADDITION, IF WE WERE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY RENEW OR RE-LEASE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THIS SPACE ON FAVORABLE ECONOMIC TERMS, THE LOSS IN RENT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  OUR OUTLET CENTERS TYPICALLY INCLUDE WELL-KNOWN, NATIONAL, BRAND NAME COMPANIES. BY MAINTAINING A BROAD BASE OF WELL-KNOWN TENANTS AND A GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF PROPERTIES LOCATED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, WE BELIEVE WE REDUCE OUR OPERATING AND LEASING RISKS. NO ONE TENANT (INCLUDING AFFILIATES) ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN  8%  OF OUR SQUARE FEET OR  7%  OF OUR RENTAL REVENUES. ACCORDINGLY, ALTHOUGH WE CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCE, WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AS A RESULT OF LEASES TO BE RENEWED OR STORES TO BE RE-LEASED. OCCUPANCY AT OUR CONSOLIDATED CENTERS WAS  96.0%  AND  95.6%  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  60", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "TANGER FACTORY OUTLET CENTERS, INC", "CIK": 899715, "Date": "2019-08-05T00:00:00", "Ticker": "SKT", "Name": "Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 6798.0, "Business": "NC", "Incorporated": "NC", "IRS": 561815473.0, "key": "20190805SKT", "labelr1": 0.8397932816537403, "labelr2": 0.960922485586165, "labelr3": 0.3807106598984804, "labelr4": -0.6953223767383023, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.43853682, "prof1": 0.5614631999999999, "return1&2": 1.0180878552971575, "return1&2&3": 1.0219638242894056, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0148578811369509, "return2": 1.0096092248558617, "return1": 1.0083979328165371, "return3": 1.0038071065989849, "return4": 0.9930467762326171, "1_day_return": 0.8397932816537335, "cumulative_return1": 10.526682491068529, "cumulative_return1&2": 39.89509899827807, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 313.55685079713817, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1144.5760403194795, "indexx": 1718, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0165464129317148, "cumreturn1b": 0.985007883760318, "cumreturndow": 0.9756937263621089, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9791636895243264}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1770, "level_0": 1822, "index": 43689, "text": "ITEM 2.

IN ADDITION, THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDES STATEMENTS OF THE OPINION OF MBIA INC.\u2019S MANAGEMENT WHICH MAY BE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE PURSUANT TO THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. THESE STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM HISTORICAL EARNINGS AND THOSE PRESENTLY ANTICIPATED OR PROJECTED.

MBIA MANAGES ITS BUSINESS WITHIN THREE OPERATING SEGMENTS: 1) UNITED STATES (\u201cU.S.\u201d) PUBLIC FINANCE INSURANCE; 2) CORPORATE; AND 3) INTERNATIONAL AND STRUCTURED FINANCE INSURANCE. OUR U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE INSURANCE PORTFOLIO IS MANAGED THROUGH NATIONAL PUBLIC FINANCE GUARANTEE CORPORATION (\u201cNATIONAL\u201d), OUR CORPORATE SEGMENT IS MANAGED THROUGH MBIA INC. AND SEVERAL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING OUR SERVICE COMPANY, MBIA SERVICES CORPORATION (\u201cMBIA SERVICES\u201d) AND OUR INTERNATIONAL AND STRUCTURED FINANCE INSURANCE BUSINESS IS PRIMARILY MANAGED THROUGH MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (\u201cMBIA CORP.\u201d). REFERENCES TO MBIA INC. GENERALLY REFER TO ACTIVITIES WITHIN OUR CORPORATE SEGMENT.  NATIONAL\u2019S PRIMARY OBJECTIVES ARE TO MAXIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS EXISTING INSURED PORTFOLIO THROUGH EFFECTIVE SURVEILLANCE AND REMEDIATION ACTIVITY AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. OUR CORPORATE SEGMENT CONSISTS OF GENERAL CORPORATE ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING PROVIDING SUPPORT SERVICES TO MBIA\u2019S OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES AND ASSET AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT. MBIA CORP.\u2019S PRIMARY OBJECTIVES ARE TO SATISFY ALL CLAIMS BY ITS POLICYHOLDERS AND TO MAXIMIZE FUTURE RECOVERIES, IF ANY, FOR ITS SENIOR LENDING AND SURPLUS NOTE HOLDERS, AND THEN ITS PREFERRED STOCK HOLDERS. MBIA CORP. IS EXECUTING THIS STRATEGY BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PURSUING VARIOUS ACTIONS FOCUSED ON MAXIMIZING THE COLLECTION OF RECOVERIES AND REDUCING AND MITIGATING POTENTIAL LOSSES ON ITS INSURANCE EXPOSURES. WE DO NOT EXPECT NATIONAL OR MBIA CORP. TO WRITE MEANINGFUL NEW BUSINESS.  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT OUR FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  (CONTINUED)  \u2022  IN FEBRUARY OF 2019, THE PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT FOR THE PUERTO RICO SALES TAX FINANCING CORPORATION (\u201cCOFINA\u201d) WAS IMPLEMENTED. NATIONAL INSURED BONDHOLDERS WERE GIVEN THE OPTION OF COMMUTING THEIR INSURANCE POLICY AND RECEIVING UNINSURED COFINA BONDS OR PLACING THEIR NEW UNINSURED COFINA BONDS INTO NATIONAL CUSTODIAL TRUSTS (THE \u201cTRUSTS\u201d) AND CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM A NATIONAL INSURANCE POLICY. AS A RESULT, SEVEN TRUSTS WERE FORMED AND CONSOLIDATED AS VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (\u201cVIES\u201d) BY THE COMPANY. NATIONAL TENDERED AND COMMUTED $182 MILLION MARKET VALUE OF NATIONAL INSURED COFINA BONDS IT OWNED FOR NEW UNINSURED COFINA BONDS, WHICH IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER TENDERED AND COMMUTED BONDS, RESULTED IN A REDUCTION TO NATIONAL\u2019S INSURED EXPOSURE TO COFINA. SINCE THE CLOSING DATE AND INITIAL DISTRIBUTION OF CASH AND BONDS, NATIONAL HAS ELECTED TO SELL SOME OF THE NEW UNINSURED BONDS HELD IN THE TRUSTS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. THE SALE OF BONDS HELD IN THE TRUSTS RESULTS IN A FURTHER REDUCTION TO NATIONAL\u2019S EXPOSURE TO COFINA. SINCE THIS TRANSACTION WAS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH JUNE 30, 2019, NATIONAL\u2019S COFINA GROSS PAR OUTSTANDING, GROSS PAR OUTSTANDING PLUS CAPITAL APPRECIATION BONDS (\u201cCABS\u201d) ACCRETED INTEREST AND DEBT SERVICE OUTSTANDING DECLINED BY APPROXIMATELY $279 MILLION, $472 MILLION AND $1.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, NATIONAL SOLD ALL OF THE NEW TAXABLE UNINSURED BONDS HELD IN THE TRUSTS, WHICH FURTHER REDUCED NATIONAL\u2019S COFINA GROSS PAR OUTSTANDING, GROSS PAR OUTSTANDING PLUS CABS ACCRETED INTEREST AND DEBT SERVICE OUTSTANDING BY APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION, $179 MILLION AND $618 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN JULY OF 2019.  \u2022  IN JULY OF 2019, MBIA CORP. CONSUMMATED A FINANCING FACILITY (THE \u201cREFINANCED FACILITY\u201d) BETWEEN MZ FUNDING LLC (\u201cMZ FUNDING\u201d) AND CERTAIN PURCHASERS, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE PURCHASERS OR THEIR AFFILIATES (COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cSENIOR LENDERS\u201d), HAVE AGREED TO REFINANCE THE OUTSTANDING INSURED SENIOR NOTES OF MZ FUNDING, AND MBIA INC. RECEIVED AMENDED SUBORDINATED NOTES OF MZ FUNDING (THE SENIOR LENDERS AND MBIA INC. BEING REFERRED TO HEREIN AS, THE \u201cLENDERS\u201d). IN CONNECTION WITH THE REFINANCING TRANSACTION, MZ FUNDING AND MBIA CORP. ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cNEW CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d AND THE LOANS THEREUNDER, THE \u201cMBIA LOANS\u201d). MBIA CORP. ISSUED NEW FINANCIAL GUARANTEE INSURANCE POLICIES (THE \u201cMBIA CORP. POLICIES\u201d) INSURING THE REFINANCED FACILITY. REFER TO THE \u201cLIQUIDITY\u201d SECTION FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE REFINANCED FACILITY.  ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET TRENDS  THE U.S. ECONOMY REMAINED HEALTHY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 DUE TO A STRONG LABOR MARKET AND LOW INFLATION. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY HAS SEEN MODERATE GAINS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN HOUSEHOLD SPENDING FROM EARLIER IN THE YEAR, HOWEVER, FIXED INVESTMENT IN THE BUSINESS SECTOR HAS BEEN TEPID. IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN U.S. HOME PRICES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE CONTINUED TO SLOW.  THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE (\u201cFOMC\u201d) LOWERED THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE BY 25 BASIS POINTS AT ITS JULY 2019 MEETING WHILE CITING POTENTIAL GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS IMPACTING THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK ALONG WITH REDUCED INFLATIONARY PRESSURES. THE FOMC STATED THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS VARIOUS ECONOMIC FACTORS INCLUDING LABOR MARKET DEVELOPMENTS, INFLATION STRESSES AND DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS RELATIVE TO ITS OBJECTIVES OF MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT AND 2% INFLATION. IN ADDITION, THE FOMC EMPHASIZED PATIENCE WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS TARGET RATE BASED ON GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS.  ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MARKET TRENDS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL RESULTS. MANY STATES AND MUNICIPALITIES HAVE EXPERIENCED GROWING TAX COLLECTIONS THAT RESULTED FROM INCREASED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND HIGHER ASSESSED PROPERTY VALUATIONS. ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENT AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL STRENGTHENS THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE ISSUERS OF OUR INSURED MUNICIPAL BONDS, IMPROVES THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR INSURED U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE PORTFOLIO AND COULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF NATIONAL\u2019S POTENTIAL INCURRED LOSSES. IN ADDITION, HIGHER PROJECTED INTEREST RATES COULD YIELD INCREASED RETURNS ON OUR COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  WE PREPARE OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d), WHICH REQUIRES THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. MANAGEMENT HAS DISCUSSED AND REVIEWED THE DEVELOPMENT, SELECTION, AND DISCLOSURE OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S AUDIT COMMITTEE. OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INCLUDE LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE (\u201cLAE\u201d) RESERVES AND VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SINCE THESE ESTIMATES REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. ANY MODIFICATIONS IN THESE ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, REFER TO \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\u201d IN PART II, ITEM 7, \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K  FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A SUMMARY OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018.  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  IN MILLIONS EXCEPT FOR PER SHARE AMOUNTS  2019  2018  2019  2018  TOTAL REVENUES  $30  $12  $80  $85  TOTAL EXPENSES  237  158  306  327  INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE INCOME TAXES  (207)  (146)  (226)  (242)  PROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR INCOME TAXES  (37)  -  (39)  2  NET INCOME (LOSS)  $(170)  $(146)  $(187)  $(244)  NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE.

BASIC  84.3  89.1  84.9  88.9  DILUTED  84.3  89.1  84.9  88.9  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 VS. THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  CONSOLIDATED TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE CHANGES IN REVENUES OF CONSOLIDATED VIES AND A DECREASE IN NET LOSSES ON AN INSURED DERIVATIVE. THE FAVORABLE CHANGE IN REVENUES OF CONSOLIDATED VIES WAS DUE TO LOWER LOSSES RELATED TO THE DECONSOLIDATION OF TWO VIES FOLLOWING THE ZOHAR BANKRUPTCY SETTLEMENT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF  2018. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INTEREST RATE SWAPS DUE TO LOWER INTEREST RATES IN 2019 AND LOWER EARNED PREMIUMS AS A RESULT OF THE ACCELERATION OF PREMIUMS RELATED TO THE TERMINATION OF A POLICY IN 2018 AND OVERALL DECREASES IN PREMIUMS FROM MATURITIES AND EARLY SETTLEMENTS OF OTHER INSURED TRANSACTIONS WITH NO MEANINGFUL WRITINGS OF NEW INSURANCE POLICIES.  CONSOLIDATED TOTAL EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018 INCLUDED $140 MILLION AND $59 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF NET INSURANCE LOSS AND LAE. THE INCREASE IN LOSS AND LAE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN LOSSES INCURRED ON CERTAIN PUERTO RICO CREDITS AND INSURED FIRST-LIEN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (\u201cRMBS\u201d).  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 VS. SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  CONSOLIDATED TOTAL REVENUES DECREASED FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NET INVESTMENT LOSSES RELATED TO OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS (\u201cOTTI\u201d) AND LOWER EARNED PREMIUMS. NET INVESTMENT LOSSES RELATED TO OTTI PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN IMPAIRED SECURITY FOR WHICH A LOSS WAS RECOGNIZED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMORTIZED COST AND NET PRESENT VALUE OF PROJECTED CASH FLOWS. LOWER EARNED PREMIUMS WERE THE RESULT OF THE ACCELERATION OF PREMIUMS RELATED TO THE TERMINATION OF A POLICY IN 2018 AND OVERALL DECREASES IN PREMIUMS FROM MATURITIES AND EARLY SETTLEMENTS OF OTHER INSURED TRANSACTIONS WITH NO MEANINGFUL WRITINGS OF NEW INSURANCE POLICIES. THESE UNFAVORABLE CHANGES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NET LOSSES ON AN INSURED DERIVATIVE AND A DECREASE IN OTHER NET REALIZED LOSSES ON  CONSOLIDATED VIES.  CONSOLIDATED TOTAL EXPENSES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018 INCLUDED $102 MILLION AND $131 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF NET INSURANCE LOSSES AND LAE. THE DECREASE IN LOSS AND LAE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN LOSSES INCURRED ON CERTAIN PUERTO RICO EXPOSURES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LOSSES INCURRED ON INSURED FIRST-LIEN RMBS.  54  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  NON-GAAP ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS)  IN ADDITION TO OUR RESULTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, WE ALSO ANALYZE THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY USING ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS), AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE, BOTH NON-GAAP MEASURES. SINCE ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) IS USED BY MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS PERFORMANCE AND MAKE BUSINESS DECISIONS, WE CONSIDER ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE FUNDAMENTAL MEASURES OF PERIODIC FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE WHICH ARE USEFUL IN UNDERSTANDING OUR RESULTS. ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE ARE NOT SUBSTITUTES FOR NET INCOME (LOSS) AND NET INCOME (LOSS) PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AND OUR DEFINITIONS OF ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE INCLUDE THE AFTER-TAX RESULTS OF THE COMPANY AND REMOVE THE AFTER-TAX RESULTS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL AND STRUCTURED FINANCE INSURANCE SEGMENT, COMPRISING THE RESULTS OF MBIA CORP. WHICH GIVEN ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS, WE DO NOT EXPECT ITS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON MBIA INC., AS WELL AS THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS (LOSSES) ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  \u2013 WE REMOVE THE IMPACT OF MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS (LOSSES) ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT PRIMARILY INCLUDE INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. ALSO ELIMINATED ARE THE MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS (LOSSES) ON WARRANTS ISSUED BY THE COMPANY. ALL OF THESE AMOUNTS FLUCTUATE BASED ON MARKET INTEREST RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, MBIA INC.\u2019S COMMON STOCK PRICE AND OTHER MARKET FACTORS.  \u2022  FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS (LOSSES)  \u2013 WE REMOVE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS (LOSSES) ON THE REMEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND TRANSACTIONS IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. GIVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS, WE EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS (LOSSES) TO PROVIDE A MEASUREMENT OF COMPARABILITY OF ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS).  \u2022  NET GAINS (LOSSES) ON SALES OF INVESTMENTS, OTTI AND EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT  \u2013 WE REMOVE GAINS (LOSSES) ON THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS, NET INVESTMENT LOSSES RELATED TO OTTI AND NET GAINS (LOSSES) ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT SINCE THE TIMING OF THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO MANAGEMENT\u2019S ASSESSMENT OF MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND CAPITAL LIQUIDITY POSITIONS.  \u2022  INCOME TAXES  \u2013 WE REMOVE THE TAX IMPACT OF MAINTAINING A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST THE COMPANY\u2019S NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET. THE COMPANY APPLIES A ZERO EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES TO ITS PRE-TAX ADJUSTMENTS.  MANAGEMENT FURTHER ADJUSTS NON-GAAP ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME (LOSS) PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE BY REMOVING THE IMPACT OF OUR U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE INSURANCE SEGMENT VIE CONSOLIDATIONS. GAAP REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO CONSOLIDATE CERTAIN VIES THAT HAVE ISSUED DEBT OBLIGATIONS INSURED BY THE COMPANY. HOWEVER, SINCE THE COMPANY DOES NOT OWN SUCH VIES, MANAGEMENT USES CERTAIN MEASURES ADJUSTED TO REMOVE THE IMPACT OF VIE CONSOLIDATIONS FOR OUR U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE INSURANCE SEGMENT IN ORDER TO REFLECT FINANCIAL EXPOSURE LIMITED TO ITS FINANCIAL GUARANTEE CONTRACTS. WHEREVER APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANY HAS SEPARATELY DISCLOSED THE EFFECT OF OUR U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE INSURANCE SEGMENT VIE CONSOLIDATIONS.  55  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2.

BOOK VALUE ADJUSTMENTS PER SHARE  IN ADDITION TO GAAP BOOK VALUE PER SHARE, FOR INTERNAL PURPOSES MANAGEMENT ALSO ANALYZES ADJUSTED BOOK VALUE (\u201cABV\u201d) PER SHARE, WHICH WE CONSIDER A MEASURE OF FUNDAMENTAL COMPANY VALUE; WE ALSO VIEW CHANGES IN THIS MEASURE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. ABV IS USED BY MANAGEMENT IN CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S COMPENSATION. PREVIOUSLY AND THROUGH OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, FOR THE BENEFIT OF INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS, MANAGEMENT PRESENTED NON-GAAP ABV TOGETHER WITH A RECONCILIATION FROM GAAP BOOK VALUE PER SHARE IN ITS PERIODIC GAAP REPORTING. BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, HOWEVER, BASED ON THE SEC\u2019S CONTINUED AND EVOLVING INTERPRETATIONS OF ITS GUIDANCE ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER PUBLICLY DISCLOSING ITS INTERNAL ABV MEASUREMENT. HOWEVER, SINCE MANY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS MAY CONTINUE TO USE ABV TO EVALUATE MBIA\u2019S SHARE PRICE AND AS THE BASIS FOR THEIR INVESTMENT DECISIONS, GOING FORWARD WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRESENT GAAP BOOK VALUE PER SHARE AS WELL AS THE INDIVIDUAL ADJUSTMENTS USED BY MANAGEMENT TO CALCULATE ITS INTERNAL ABV METRIC.  MANAGEMENT ADJUSTS GAAP BOOK VALUE TO REMOVE THE BOOK VALUE OF MBIA CORP. AND FOR CERTAIN ITEMS WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES WILL REVERSE FROM GAAP BOOK VALUE THROUGH GAAP EARNINGS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, AS WELL AS ADD IN THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN ITEMS WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES WILL BE REALIZED IN GAAP BOOK VALUE IN FUTURE PERIODS.

BASED ON OUR VIEW THAT GIVEN MBIA CORP.\u2019S CURRENT FINANCIAL CONDITION, THE REGULATORY REGIME IN WHICH IT OPERATES, THE PRIORITY GIVEN TO ITS POLICYHOLDERS, SURPLUS NOTE HOLDERS AND PREFERRED STOCK HOLDERS WITH RESPECT TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS, AND ITS LEGAL STRUCTURE, IT IS NOT AND WILL NOT LIKELY BE IN A POSITION TO UPSTREAM ANY ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO MBIA INC.

GAINS AND LOSSES FROM SALES AND OTTI OF AFS SECURITIES ARE RECORDED IN BOOK VALUE THROUGH EARNINGS.  \u2022  NET UNEARNED PREMIUM REVENUE IN EXCESS OF EXPECTED LOSSES OF NATIONAL  - WE INCLUDE NET UNEARNED PREMIUM REVENUE IN EXCESS OF EXPECTED LOSSES. NET UNEARNED PREMIUM REVENUE IN EXCESS OF EXPECTED LOSSES CONSISTS OF THE FINANCIAL GUARANTEE UNEARNED PREMIUM REVENUE OF NATIONAL IN EXCESS OF EXPECTED INSURANCE LOSSES, NET OF REINSURANCE AND DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, A LOSS RESERVE ON A FINANCIAL GUARANTEE POLICY IS ONLY RECORDED WHEN EXPECTED LOSSES EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF UNEARNED PREMIUM REVENUE RECORDED FOR THAT POLICY. AS A RESULT, WE ONLY ADD TO GAAP BOOK VALUE THE AMOUNT OF UNEARNED PREMIUM REVENUE IN EXCESS OF EXPECTED LOSSES FOR EACH POLICY IN ORDER TO REFLECT THE FULL AMOUNT OF OUR EXPECTED LOSSES. THE COMPANY\u2019S NET UNEARNED PREMIUM REVENUE WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN GAAP BOOK VALUE IN FUTURE PERIODS, HOWEVER, ACTUAL AMOUNTS COULD DIFFER FROM ESTIMATED AMOUNTS DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS CREDIT DEFAULTS AND POLICY TERMINATIONS, AMONG OTHERS.  \u2022  GAIN (LOSS) RELATED TO NATIONAL VIE CONSOLIDATIONS  \u2013 WE REMOVE THE IMPACT OF VIE CONSOLIDATIONS BY NATIONAL. GAAP REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO CONSOLIDATE CERTAIN VIES AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INSURANCE POLICIES.

CERTAIN STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TERRITORY OBLIGORS THAT NATIONAL INSURES ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL AND BUDGETARY STRESS. THIS COULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN DEFAULTS BY SUCH ENTITIES ON THE PAYMENT OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS AND LOSSES OR IMPAIRMENTS ON A GREATER NUMBER OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INSURED TRANSACTIONS. IN PARTICULAR, PUERTO RICO IS EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT FISCAL STRESS AND CONSTRAINED LIQUIDITY DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PUERTO RICO\u2019S STRUCTURAL BUDGET IMBALANCE, THE LACK OF ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS, A STAGNATING LOCAL ECONOMY, NET MIGRATION OF PEOPLE OUT OF PUERTO RICO AND A HIGH DEBT BURDEN.

THE DECREASE IN NET PREMIUMS EARNED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018 RESULTED FROM DECREASES IN REFUNDED PREMIUMS EARNED OF $3 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SCHEDULED PREMIUMS EARNED OF $2 MILLION. THE DECREASE IN NET PREMIUMS EARNED FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018 RESULTED FROM DECREASES IN REFUNDED PREMIUMS EARNED OF $15 MILLION. REFUNDING ACTIVITY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS ACCELERATED PREMIUM EARNINGS IN PRIOR YEARS AND REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF SCHEDULED PREMIUMS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EARNED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. NET PREMIUMS EARNED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 INCLUDES THE ELIMINATION OF $1 MILLION AND $2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF VIES. THE COMPANY DID NOT CONSOLIDATE ANY VIES IN ITS U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE SEGMENT DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.

NET INVESTMENT LOSSES RELATED TO OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS NET INVESTMENT LOSSES RELATED TO OTTI FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN IMPAIRED SECURITY FOR WHICH A LOSS WAS RECOGNIZED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMORTIZED COST AND NET PRESENT VALUE OF PROJECTED CASH FLOWS.

THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NET GAINS FROM INCREASES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF COLLATERAL SINCE CONSOLIDATING THE VIES. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, TOTAL REVENUES OF CONSOLIDATED VIES WERE $6 MILLION. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NET GAINS FROM INCREASES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF COLLATERAL SINCE CONSOLIDATING THE VIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOSS ON THE INITIAL CONSOLIDATION OF THE VIES IN FEBRUARY OF 2019. WE ELECTED TO RECORD AT FAIR VALUE CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE CONSOLIDATED UNDER ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR CONSOLIDATION OF VIES AND, AS SUCH, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THESE INSTRUMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE INVESTMENTS HELD AND DEBT ISSUED, ARE REFLECTED IN EARNINGS.

NOTWITHSTANDING THAT HOLDING, THE FIRST CIRCUIT AFFIRMED JUDGE SWAIN\u2019S DENIAL OF APPELLANTS\u2019 MOTIONS TO DISMISS THE TITLE III PETITIONS, CONCLUDING THAT THE BOARD\u2019S CONSTITUTIONAL INFIRMITY DID NOT ALTER OR IMPAIR THE VALIDITY OF THE BOARD\u2019S PAST ACTS, AND STAYED ITS MANDATE FOR 90 DAYS TO ALLOW THE PRESIDENT AND THE SENATE TO VALIDATE THE CURRENTLY DEFECTIVE APPOINTMENTS OR RECONSTITUTE THE BOARD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE.  ON APRIL 24, 2019, THE OVERSIGHT BOARD FILED A REQUEST WITH THE FIRST CIRCUIT TO EXTEND THE 90 DAY STAY INDEFINITELY PENDING SUPREME COURT REVIEW. ON APRIL 29, 2019, AURELIUS, ASSURED AND UTIER FILED BRIEFS IN OPPOSITION, ARGUING THAT THE STAY REQUEST SHOULD BE DENIED BECAUSE THE OVERSIGHT BOARD CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THAT AT LEAST FIVE JUSTICES WOULD VOTE TO REVERSE THIS FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE DECISION. ON MAY 6, 2019, THE FIRST CIRCUIT ENTERED AN ORDER DENYING THE OVERSIGHT BOARD\u2019S REQUEST BUT EXTENDED THE STAY OF ITS MANDATE 60 DAYS UNTIL JULY 15, 2019. ON JUNE 18, 2019, THE OVERSIGHT BOARD FILED A MOTION ASKING THE FIRST CIRCUIT TO STAY THE ISSUANCE OF ITS MANDATE PENDING THE SUPREME COURT\u2019S DISPOSITION OF MULTIPLE CERTIFICATION PETITIONS APPEALING THE FEBRUARY 15 DECISION. ON JUNE 20, 2019, THE SUPREME COURT GRANTED THE CERTIFICATION PETITIONS. ON JULY 2, 2019, THE FIRST CIRCUIT GRANTED THE OVERSIGHT BOARD\u2019S MOTION TO STAY THE MANDATE PENDING THE SUPREME COURT\u2019S FINAL DISPOSITION.  61  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  AS A RESULT OF PRIOR DEFAULTS, VARIOUS STAYS AND THE TITLE III CASES, PUERTO RICO FAILED TO MAKE CERTAIN SCHEDULED DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS FOR NATIONAL INSURED BONDS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, NATIONAL HAS PAID GROSS CLAIMS IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $756 MILLION RELATING TO GENERAL OBLIGATION (\u201cGO\u201d) BONDS, PBA BONDS, PREPA BONDS AND PRHTA BONDS THROUGH JUNE 30, 2019. SUBSEQUENTLY, ON JULY 1, 2019, PUERTO RICO ALSO DEFAULTED ON SCHEDULED DEBT SERVICE FOR NATIONAL INSURED BONDS AND NATIONAL PAID GROSS CLAIMS IN THE AGGREGATE OF $328 MILLION. INCLUSIVE OF THE JULY 1, 2019 CLAIMS AND THE COMMUTATION PAYMENT RELATED TO THE COFINA PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT, NATIONAL HAS PAID TOTAL GROSS CLAIMS IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION RELATED TO PUERTO RICO.  ON MAY 2, 2019, THE OVERSIGHT BOARD AND THE OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF UNSECURED CREDITORS OF ALL TITLE III DEBTORS (OTHER THAN COFINA) (THE \u201cCOMMITTEE\u201d) FILED LIEN AVOIDANCE ADVERSARY COMPLAINTS AGAINST SEVERAL HUNDRED DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING NATIONAL, CHALLENGING THE EXISTENCE, EXTENT, AND ENFORCEABILITY OF GO BONDHOLDERS\u2019 LIENS. THE COURT HAS STAYED THE PROCEEDINGS UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1, 2019.  ON JULY 24, 2019, JUDGE SWAIN ENTERED AN ORDER STAYING CERTAIN ADVERSARY PROCEEDINGS AND CONTESTED MATTERS UNTIL NOVEMBER 30, 2019, AND IMPOSING MANDATORY MEDIATION UNDER JUDGE HOUSER. AMONG THE MATTERS STAYED IN WHICH NATIONAL IS EITHER A PARTY IN INTEREST OR INTERVENOR ARE THE (I) PBA ADVERSARY PROCEEDING SEEKING TO RECHARACTERIZE THE PBA BONDS AS FINANCINGS AND (II) GO ADVERSARY AND HTA ADVERSARY PROCEEDINGS, BOTH CHALLENGING BONDHOLDER LIENS.  STATUS OF PUERTO RICO\u2019S FISCAL PLANS  IN 2018, THE PUERTO RICO GOVERNMENT SUBMITTED SEVERAL DRAFT FISCAL PLANS TO THE OVERSIGHT BOARD, WHICH PURPORTED TO REFLECT THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S EXPECTED ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR PUERTO RICO OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD AFTER INTEGRATING FOUR ADDITIONAL KEY DRIVERS INTO THE PRIOR PROJECTIONS THAT HAD FORMED THE BASIS OF PREVIOUS FISCAL PLAN SUBMISSIONS: (I) THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF HURRICANE MARIA, (II) MITIGATING IMPACT OF DISASTER RELIEF ASSISTANCE, (III) CHANGES TO REVENUE AND EXPENSE MEASURES, AND (IV) IMPACT OF STRUCTURAL REFORMS.  ON OCTOBER 23, 2018, THE OVERSIGHT BOARD VOTED TO CERTIFY THE COMMONWEALTH FISCAL PLAN, AS AMENDED. THIS CERTIFIED FISCAL PLAN REFLECTS A $17.0 BILLION SURPLUS OVER A  SIX-YEAR  PERIOD AS COMPARED TO $7.2 BILLION IN THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S PRIOR FISCAL PLAN.  ON SEPTEMBER 7, 2018, COFINA SUBMITTED A REVISED FISCAL PLAN, THAT INCORPORATED CHANGES AND EXPLANATIONS REQUIRED BY THE OVERSIGHT BOARD. ON OCTOBER 18, 2018, THE OVERSIGHT BOARD VOTED TO CERTIFY THE COFINA FISCAL PLAN, AS AMENDED.  ON MAY 9, 2019, AFTER REQUESTING APPROVAL TO AMEND ITS FISCAL PLANS AND THE SUBMISSION OF SEVERAL  NON-COMPLIANT  VERSIONS BY THE PUERTO RICO GOVERNMENT, THE OVERSIGHT BOARD CERTIFIED ITS OWN REVISED FISCAL PLAN FOR THE COMMONWEALTH. THE REVISED FISCAL PLAN REFLECTS A CUMULATIVE SURPLUS OF $13.7 BILLION OVER THE  SIX-YEAR  PROJECTION PERIOD (AFTER MEASURES AND STRUCTURAL REFORMS, BUT BEFORE CONTRACTUAL DEBT SERVICE). THE NEW SURPLUS IS ABOUT $3.5 BILLION LOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS PLAN, WHICH REFLECTED A SURPLUS OF ALMOST $17 BILLION. FOR THE REMAINING COMPONENT UNITS, THE OVERSIGHT BOARD CERTIFIED FISCAL PLANS FOR BOTH PRHTA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO (THE \u201cUNIVERSITY\u201d) ON JUNE 5, 2019, WHILE CERTIFYING A REVISED FISCAL PLAN FOR PREPA ON JUNE 27, 2019. THE OVERSIGHT BOARD ALSO CERTIFIED THE FISCAL YEAR 2020 BUDGETS FOR COMMONWEALTH, PREPA, THE UNIVERSITY AND PRHTA.  ON JUNE 17, 2019, THE OVERSIGHT BOARD ANNOUNCED IT REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH CERTAIN COMMONWEALTH BONDHOLDERS AND PBA BONDHOLDERS ON A FRAMEWORK FOR A PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT TO RESOLVE $35.0 BILLION WORTH OF DEBT AND UNSECURED CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMMONWEALTH. THE SUPPORTING CREDITORS, WHICH COLLECTIVELY HOLD ABOUT $3.0 BILLION OF BONDS, EXECUTED A PLAN SUPPORT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cPSA\u201d), THAT, IF IMPLEMENTED, PURPORTS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF COMMONWEALTH RELATED BONDS TO LESS THAN $12.0 BILLION FROM ABOUT $18.0 BILLION. THE PSA PROVIDES FOR A RANGE OF RECOVERIES FOR  PRE-2012  GO BONDHOLDERS, RANGING FROM 64.3% AND 89.4%. PBA BONDHOLDERS WOULD RECEIVE A SLIGHTLY HIGHER RANGE OF RECOVERIES DUE ON SOURCED RECOVERIES. THE PSA ALSO PROVIDES A MECHANISM TO SETTLE OUTSTANDING LITIGATION RELATING TO THE INVALIDATION OF $6.0 BILLION IN COMMONWEALTH GENERAL OBLIGATIONS BONDS ISSUED IN 2012 AND 2014. THESE LAST VINTAGE BONDHOLDERS WOULD HAVE THE OPTION TO LITIGATE FOR EQUAL TREATMENT AS THE  PRE-2012  BONDS OR SETTLE AT LEVELS MEANINGFULLY BELOW THE EARLY VINTAGE BONDS\u2019 FLOOR RECOVERY. THE RECOVERY FOR THE  PRE-2012  BONDS ADJUSTS DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF THE LITIGATION AND NUMBER OF BONDHOLDERS THAT OPT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PSA SETTLEMENT TERMS. FURTHERMORE, THE OVERSIGHT BOARD HAS ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO FILE A PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT BASED ON THIS AGREEMENT IN THE COMING WEEKS WITH A GOAL OF HAVING A PLAN CONFIRMED BY EARLY 2020. NEITHER THE COMMONWEALTH NOR ITS ADVISOR, THE PUERTO RICO FISCAL AGENCY AND FINANCIAL ADVISORY AUTHORITY (\u201cAAFAF\u201d) EXECUTED THE PSA, INDICATING THAT THEY WILL NOT SUPPORT ANY PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT THAT IMPAIRS PENSIONS FOR RETIREES. NATIONAL INSURES ONLY  PRE-2012  BONDS AND IS NOT PARTY TO THE PSA.  62  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  PBA  ON DECEMBER 21, 2018, THE OVERSIGHT BOARD FILED AN ADVERSARY COMPLAINT SEEKING TO DISALLOW THE PBA\u2019S ADMINISTRATIVE RENT CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMMONWEALTH. THE PBA BONDS ARE PAYABLE FROM THE RENT THE COMMONWEALTH PAYS UNDER ITS LEASE AGREEMENTS WITH THE PBA. THE OVERSIGHT BOARD ALLEGES THAT THE COMMONWEALTH HAS NO OBLIGATION TO MAKE RENT PAYMENTS UNDER SECTION 365(D)(3) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE AND THAT THE PBA IS NOT ENTITLED TO A PRIORITY ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE CLAIM UNDER THE LEASES. ON APRIL 16, 2019, JUDGE SWAIN ENTERED AN ORDER SETTING A DISCOVERY SCHEDULE. IN ANTICIPATION OF A PLAN SUPPORT AGREEMENT IN THE COMMONWEALTH TITLE III PROCEEDING, THE OVERSIGHT BOARD FILED A MOTION TO STAY THE PBA ADVERSARY PROCEEDING ON JUNE 27, 2019. JUDGE SWAIN HAS STAYED ALL PENDING DEADLINES IN THE PBA PROCEEDING PENDING RESOLUTION OF THE OVERSIGHT BOARD\u2019S MOTION.  COFINA  THE OVERSIGHT BOARD FILED A PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT AND DISCLOSURE STATEMENT ON OCTOBER 19, 2018. THE PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT IS THE CULMINATION OF EFFORTS BY INTERESTED PARTIES TO RESOLVE THE COMMONWEALTH-COFINA DISPUTE OVER THE OWNERSHIP OF THE TERRITORY\u2019S SALES AND USE TAXES. THE PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT REFLECTS THE SETTLEMENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH-COFINA DISPUTE BY ALLOCATING AN AMOUNT UP TO 53.65% OF THE PLEDGED SALES TAX BASE AMOUNT IN ANY GIVEN YEAR TO COFINA AND THE BALANCE (46.35%) OF THE ANNUAL PLEDGED SALES TAX BASE AMOUNT TO THE COMMONWEALTH. THE PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT FURTHER PROVIDED FOR SENIOR COFINA BONDHOLDERS TO RECEIVE A 93.0% RECOVERY ON THEIR PREPETITION BOND CLAIMS AND SUBORDINATE BONDHOLDERS TO RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY 56.4% OF THEIR PREPETITION CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, TO COMPENSATE BONDHOLDERS FOR THE COST OF NEGOTIATING AND EXECUTING THE PSA, BONDHOLDERS THAT ARE PARTY TO THE PSA RECEIVED, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, A PRO RATA SHARE OF ADDITIONAL CASH IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO 2.0% OF THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF EXISTING COFINA BOND CLAIMS. A HEARING REGARDING THE COMMONWEALTH\u2019S MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND TO CONFIRM THE PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT WAS HELD ON JANUARY 16 AND 17, 2019 IN SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO. THE COURT TOOK CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT AND APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT UNDER ADVISEMENT AND DIRECTED THE PARTIES TO SUBMIT SUPPLEMENTATION IN SUPPORT OF THE RELIEF REQUESTED AT THE CONFIRMATION HEARING BY JANUARY 21, 2019 AND SUPPLEMENTAL BRIEFING BY JANUARY 24, 2019 SUPPORTING THE AUTHORITY OF THE COURT TO DETERMINE THE SUBSTANTIVE VALIDITY OF THE NEW COFINA BOND LEGISLATION AND RESOLVE CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES TO THE COFINA STRUCTURE, AMONG OTHER THINGS. A CONFIRMATION ORDER WAS ISSUED ON FEBRUARY 4, 2019 AND THE CLOSING OCCURRED ON FEBRUARY 12, 2019.  AS PART OF THE PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT, NATIONAL TENDERED AND COMMUTED $182 MILLION MARKET VALUE OF NATIONAL INSURED COFINA BONDS IT OWNED FOR NEW UNINSURED COFINA BONDS, WHICH IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER TENDERED AND COMMUTED BONDS, RESULTED IN A REDUCTION TO NATIONAL\u2019S INSURED EXPOSURE TO COFINA. THE PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT ALSO PROVIDED FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TRUSTS TO HOLD NEW UNINSURED COFINA BONDS FOR THE BENEFIT OF INSURED BONDHOLDERS AND TO TRACK NATIONAL\u2019S ORIGINAL OBLIGATION AS ADJUSTED. IN THE AGGREGATE, AS A RESULT OF NATIONAL-INSURED BONDHOLDERS, INCLUDING NATIONAL, CHOOSING TO RECEIVE UNINSURED COFINA BONDS, AND THE INITIAL DISTRIBUTION OF CASH TO THE TRUSTS, NATIONAL\u2019S COFINA GROSS PAR OUTSTANDING, GROSS PAR OUTSTANDING PLUS CABS ACCRETED INTEREST AND DEBT SERVICE OUTSTANDING DECLINED BY APPROXIMATELY $219 MILLION, $375 MILLION AND $1.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SINCE THE CLOSING DATE AND INITIAL DISTRIBUTION, NATIONAL HAS ELECTED TO SELL SOME OF THE NEW UNINSURED BONDS HELD IN THE TRUSTS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. THE DECISION TO SELL BONDS HELD IN THE TRUSTS HAS RESULTED IN A FURTHER REDUCTION TO NATIONAL\u2019S EXPOSURE TO COFINA. THE IMPACT OF SUCH BOND SALES ARE REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. IN ADDITION, SUBSEQUENT TO JUNE 30, 2019, NATIONAL SOLD ALL OF THE NEW TAXABLE UNINSURED BONDS HELD IN THE TRUSTS FOR APPROXIMATELY $183 MILLION IN PAR VALUE. THE PROCEEDS OF SUCH SALE WERE SETTLED ON JULY 2, 2019 AND CREDITED AGAINST THE TRUSTS SHORTLY THEREAFTER.  PREPA  NATIONAL\u2019S LARGEST EXPOSURE TO PUERTO RICO, BY GROSS PAR OUTSTANDING, IS TO PREPA. INITIAL ATTEMPTS TO REACH A CONSENSUAL RESTRUCTURING FOR PREPA WERE REJECTED BY THE OVERSIGHT BOARD IN JUNE 2017 AND PREPA ENTERED TITLE III RESTRUCTURING ON JULY 2, 2017.  THE MOST RECENT PREPA REVISED FISCAL PLAN CERTIFIED ON JUNE 27, 2019 OUTLINES A WHOLESALE TRANSFORMATION OF PREPA TO AT LEAST A PARTIALLY PRIVATIZED ENTITY FURTHER EXPANDING ON INITIATIVES PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED. ADVISORS TO THE OVERSIGHT BOARD HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO ASSESS INVESTOR INTEREST FOR PRIVATIZATION THOUGH DETAILS AND TIMING OF ANY POTENTIAL TRANSACTION REMAIN UNCLEAR.  SEPARATELY, THE GOVERNMENT OF PUERTO RICO ENACTED ITS OWN PRIVATIZATION LEGISLATION WHICH PROPOSES THE SALE AND PRIVATIZATION OF GENERATING ASSETS AND CONCESSIONAIRE AGREEMENT FOR TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION ASSETS. MANY IMPORTANT DETAILS REMAIN UNDER DEVELOPMENT. IN OCTOBER OF 2018, THE COMMONWEALTH ISSUED A REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS SEEKING TO IDENTIFY QUALIFIED POTENTIAL CONCESSIONAIRES. FOUR RESPONDENTS WERE SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN A CONFIDENTIAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL PROCESS WITH A STATED GOAL OF SELECTING A PREFERRED PROPOSAL BY THE END OF 2019; THE PROGRESS REGARDING THE SALE OF GENERATING ASSETS IS LESS CLEAR. SEPARATELY THE PUERTO RICAN SENATE PASSED LEGISLATION IN DECEMBER 2018 TO ESTABLISH THE REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK TO GOVERN SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT; THAT THE PUERTO RICAN HOUSE APPROVED THE BILL IN MARCH OF 2019 AND IT WAS ENACTED INTO LAW IN APRIL 2019.  63  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  ON JULY 30, 2018, PREPA, THE OVERSIGHT BOARD, THE AAFAF AND THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED A PRELIMINARY RESTRUCTURING SUPPORT AGREEMENT WITH CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE AD HOC GROUP OF PREPA BONDHOLDERS.  ON OCTOBER 3, 2018, NATIONAL, TOGETHER WITH ASSURED GUARANTY CORP., ASSURED GUARANTY MUNICIPAL CORP., AND SYNCORA GUARANTEE INC. (COLLECTIVELY, \u201cMOVANTS\u201d) FILED A MOTION IN THE TITLE III CASE FOR PREPA FOR RELIEF FROM THE AUTOMATIC STAY TO ALLOW MOVANTS TO EXERCISE THEIR STATUTORY RIGHT TO HAVE A RECEIVER APPOINTED AT PREPA (THE \u201cRECEIVER MOTION\u201d). MOVANTS ARGUE THAT PREPA\u2019S LONG HISTORY OF MISMANAGEMENT AND POLITICIZATION HAS HARMED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO HARM, ALL OF ITS STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING CREDITORS AND THE PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO. MOVANTS WRITE THAT A RECEIVER IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT PREPA IS MANAGED IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF ALL OF ITS CONSTITUENTS.  ON MAY 3, 2019, PREPA, THE OVERSIGHT BOARD, THE AAFAF, THE AD HOC GROUP OF PREPA BONDHOLDERS (THE \u201cAD HOC GROUP\u201d), AND ASSURED GUARANTY CORP. AND ASSURED GUARANTY MUNICIPAL CORP. (\u201cASSURED\u201d) (TOGETHER, THE \u201cRSA PARTIES\u201d) ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE RESTRUCTURING SUPPORT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cRSA\u201d).  AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE RSA CONTEMPLATES A TRANSACTION PURSUANT TO WHICH, UPON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF A PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT, PREPA\u2019S LEGACY BONDS WILL BE EXCHANGED FOR NEW SECURITIZATION BONDS TO BE ISSUED IN TWO TRANCHES (THE \u201cSECURITIZATION BONDS\u201d). IN ADDITION, BEGINNING ON AUGUST 30, 2019, HOLDERS OF BONDS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE RSA WILL RECEIVE MONTHLY SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS FUNDED BY A SETTLEMENT CHARGE TO BE INCLUDED ON CUSTOMER BILLS (THE \u201cSETTLEMENT PAYMENTS\u201d) UNTIL THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF A PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT FOR PREPA. THE SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO INCREASE IF A PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT IS NOT CONFIRMED BEFORE MARCH 31, 2021. THE RSA PROVIDES THAT SUPPORTING PARTIES WILL RECEIVE AN ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIM EQUAL TO INTEREST ACCRUED ON CERTAIN OF THE SECURITIZATION BONDS, LESS THE AMOUNT OF ANY SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS MADE ON ACCOUNT OF SUCH BONDS, WHICH ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIM SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THE RSA. ADDITIONALLY, PURSUANT TO THE RSA, SUPPORTING CREDITORS WILL ALSO RECEIVE CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS. THE RSA CONTEMPLATES THE FILING OF A PLAN OF ADJUSTMENT FOR PREPA BY MARCH 31, 2020.  THE RSA ALSO CONTAINS SEVERAL PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE VARIOUS STEPS TO BE TAKEN IN THE TITLE III COURT THAT, IF SUCCESSFUL, WOULD PREVENT NATIONAL FROM PROSECUTING THE RECEIVER MOTION. PURSUANT TO THE RSA, THE OVERSIGHT BOARD FILED A 9019 MOTION WITH THE TITLE III COURT IN MAY 2019 SEEKING APPROVAL OF THE RSA (THE \u201cSETTLEMENT MOTION\u201d) AND A MOTION TO DISMISS THE RECEIVER MOTION (TOGETHER, THE \u201cMOTIONS\u201d). THE RSA REQUIRES THE AD HOC GROUP TO SUPPORT, AND ASSURED NOT TO OPPOSE, THE MOTION TO DISMISS. THE RSA FURTHER STATES THAT THE HEARING FOR APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT MOTION IS CONTINGENT ON RECEIVING NO LATER THAN TWO BUSINESS DAYS PRIOR TO SUCH HEARING THE SUPPORT OF HOLDERS OR INSURERS REPRESENTING A MINIMUM OF 60% IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ALL LEGACY BONDS. APPROXIMATELY 72% OF PREPA\u2019S BONDHOLDERS HAVE ALREADY JOINED THE DEAL. THAT NUMBER WILL REACH OVER 74% IF SYNCORA GUARANTEE INC., WHO HAS AGREED IN PRINCIPAL TO JOIN THE RSA, FORMALLY SIGNS ON. THE TITLE III COURT DENIED THE EXPEDITED TREATMENT SOUGHT BY THE OVERSIGHT BOARD AND HAS SCHEDULED A HEARING ON THE MOTIONS FOR OCTOBER 3, 2019. THE RECEIVER MOTION HAS ALSO BEEN STAYED UNTIL THE COURT RULES ON THE MOTIONS.  NATIONAL IS NOT CURRENTLY A PARTY TO THE RSA. NATIONAL EXPECTS TO OBJECT TO BOTH MOTIONS, UNLESS AN AGREEMENT IS REACHED WITH THE RSA PARTIES ON AN AMENDMENT TO THE RSA PURSUANT TO WHICH NATIONAL WOULD JOIN THE RSA.  AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE RSA, ON JULY 1, 2019 THE OVERSIGHT BOARD AND AAFAF ALSO FILED AN ADVERSARY COMPLAINT AGAINST THE TRUSTEE FOR THE PREPA BONDS, CHALLENGING THE VALIDITY OF THE LIENS ARISING UNDER THE TRUST AGREEMENT THAT SECURE INSURED OBLIGATIONS OF NATIONAL. THE ADVERSARY PROCEEDING IS STAYED UNTIL THE EARLIER OF (A) 60 DAYS AFTER THE COURT DENIES THE 9019 MOTION, (B) CONSUMMATION OF A PLAN, (C) 60 DAYS AFTER THE FILING BY THE OVERSIGHT BOARD AND AAFAF OF A LITIGATION NOTICE, OR (D) FURTHER ORDER OF THE COURT.  PRHTA  ON MAY 21, 2017, THE OVERSIGHT BOARD COMMENCED A TITLE III CASE FOR PRHTA. ON JUNE 3, 2017, NATIONAL, TOGETHER WITH ASSURED AND ASSURED GUARANTY MUNICIPAL CORP., FILED AN ADVERSARY PROCEEDING SEEKING TO ENFORCE THE SPECIAL REVENUE PROTECTIONS OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE WHICH ARE INCORPORATED INTO PROMESA. THESE PROVISIONS ENSURE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT (I) CURRENT TAX AND TOLL REVENUES REMAIN SUBJECT TO LIENS AND (II) THE AUTOMATIC STAY RESULTING FROM A FILING OF A TITLE III PETITION DOES NOT STAY OR LIMIT APPLICATION OF THESE PLEDGED SPECIAL REVENUES TO THE REPAYMENT OF PRHTA DEBT. ON JANUARY 30, 2018, THE COURT GRANTED MOTIONS TO DISMISS THE ADVERSARY PROCEEDING. THE PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THIS DECISION TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIRST CIRCUIT AND ORAL ARGUMENT WAS HELD ON NOVEMBER 5, 2018 IN SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO. ON MARCH 26, 2019, THE FIRST CIRCUIT HELD THAT THE SPECIAL REVENUE PROVISION OF CHAPTER 9, INCORPORATED INTO TITLE III, PERMIT, BUT DO NOT REQUIRE, CONTINUED PAYMENT OF SPECIAL REVENUES BY A DEBTOR DURING THE PENDENCY OF BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. THE COURT FURTHER HELD THAT CONSENSUAL PREPETITION LIENS ON SPECIAL REVENUES WILL REMAIN IN PLACE AFTER THE FILING OF THE BANKRUPTCY PETITION, BUT AGREED WITH THE DISTRICT COURT THAT THE PROVISION \u201cDOES NOT MANDATE THE TURNOVER OF SPECIAL REVENUES OR REQUIRE CONTINUITY OF PAYMENTS OF THE PRHTA BONDS DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE TITLE III PROCEEDING.\u201d APPELLANTS HAVE SUBMITTED A MOTION SEEKING REVIEW OF THIS OPINION BY THE FULL FIRST CIRCUIT PANEL, AND WILL DETERMINE WITHIN THE 90 DAYS OF THIS DECISION WHETHER TO FILE A WRIT OF CERTIORARI FOR HEARING BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. ON JULY 31, 2019, THE FIRST CIRCUIT DENIED THE REQUEST FOR FULL PANEL REVIEW, WHICH WILL PERMIT THE MOVANTS TO FILE A WRIT OF CERTIORARI REQUESTING A SUPREME COURT REVIEW OF THE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S RULING.  64  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  ON MAY 20, 2019, THE OVERSIGHT BOARD AND THE COMMITTEE FILED A LIEN AVOIDANCE ADVERSARY COMPLAINT AGAINST FISCAL AGENTS, HOLDERS, AND INSURERS OF CERTAIN PRHTA BONDS, INCLUDING NATIONAL. THE COMPLAINT CHALLENGES THE EXTENT AND ENFORCEABILITY OF CERTAIN SECURITY INTERESTS IN PRHTA\u2019S REVENUES. THE COURT HAS STAYED THE PROCEEDINGS UNTIL SEPTEMBER 1, 2019. THIS ADVERSARY PROCEEDING WAS SUBSEQUENTLY STAYED BY ORDER OF THE TITLE II COURT UNTIL NOVEMBER 30, 2019 PENDING THE OUTCOME OF MEDIATION.  OTHER  OTHER THAN THE INTER AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO INC, S&P, FITCH RATINGS AND/OR MOODY\u2019S HAVE DOWNGRADED THE RATINGS OF ALL PUERTO RICO ISSUERS TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE WITH A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK DUE TO ONGOING ECONOMIC PRESSURES, WHICH WILL WEIGH ON PUERTO RICO\u2019S ABILITY TO MEET DEBT AND OTHER FUNDING OBLIGATIONS, POTENTIALLY DRIVING BONDHOLDER RECOVERY RATES LOWER AS RESTRUCTURING THE ISLAND\u2019S DEBT BURDEN UNFOLDS.  ON JANUARY 10, 2019, THE UNIVERSITY RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM THE MIDDLE STATES COMMISSION ON HIGHER EDUCATION (THE \u201cCOMMISSION\u201d) PLACING THE UNIVERSITY\u2019S 11 INSTITUTIONS ON \u201cSHOW CAUSE\u201d STATUS. THE UNIVERSITY HAD UNTIL THE END OF JANUARY 2019 TO SUBMIT REQUESTED REPORTS AND ARGUE WHY ITS ACCREDITATION SHOULD NOT BE REVOKED. ON JANUARY 14, 2019, THE UNIVERSITY SUBMITTED AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO THE ACCREDITATION AGENCY. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE COMMISSION ANNOUNCED AT ITS MEETING ON JUNE 27, 2019, THAT IT REMOVED ALL 11 INSTITUTIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY FROM SHOW CAUSE AND REAFFIRMED THE UNIVERSITY\u2019S ACCREDITATION FOLLOWING COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMMISSION\u2019S STANDARDS FOR ACCREDITATION AND REQUIREMENTS FOR AFFILIATIONS.

THESE FAIR VALUE LOSSES RESULTED FROM THE IMPACT OF DECREASES IN INTEREST RATES DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 ON INTEREST RATE SWAPS FOR WHICH WE RECEIVE FLOATING RATES, COMPARED WITH FAIR VALUE GAINS DUE TO INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2018. IN ADDITION, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, THERE WERE FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES ON EURO-DENOMINATED MTNS FROM THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR VERSUS FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 FROM THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR.  OPERATING EXPENSES OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSFER OF EMPLOYEES FROM OUR U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE INSURANCE SEGMENT AND ADDITIONAL RESTRICTED STOCK EXPENSE. HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES RELATED TO THE TRANSFER OF EMPLOYEES ALSO RESULTED IN HIGHER FEES REVENUE IN OUR CORPORATE SEGMENT AS SERVICES WERE RECHARGED TO OUR U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE SEGMENT.

NET PREMIUMS EARNED DECREASED FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACCELERATION OF PREMIUM EARNINGS IN 2018 RELATED TO THE TERMINATION OF A POLICY AND OVERALL DECREASES IN SCHEDULED PREMIUM EARNINGS IN 2019 FROM THE MATURITY AND EARLY SETTLEMENTS OF OTHER INSURED TRANSACTIONS WITH NO WRITINGS OF NEW INSURANCE POLICIES.  NET CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF INSURED DERIVATIVES REALIZED LOSSES ON INSURED DERIVATIVES INCLUDE PAYMENTS MADE NET OF PREMIUMS AND FEES EARNED AND SALVAGE RECEIVED. PREMIUMS EARNED RELATED TO INSURED CREDIT DERIVATIVES WILL DECREASE OVER TIME AS A RESULT OF SETTLEMENTS PRIOR TO MATURITY AND AMORTIZATION. FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, REALIZED LOSSES ON INSURED DERIVATIVES RESULTED FROM CLAIM PAYMENTS ON COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES EXPOSURE.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, UNREALIZED GAINS ON INSURED DERIVATIVES WERE PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE REVERSAL OF UNREALIZED LOSSES RESULTING FROM GROSS PAR AMORTIZATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE REMAINING UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, UNREALIZED GAINS ON INSURED DERIVATIVES WERE PRINCIPALLY THE RESULT OF PAR AMORTIZATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECTS OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE MARKET\u2019S PERCEPTION OF MBIA CORP.\u2019S NONPERFORMANCE RISK ON ITS DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE FAIR VALUE OF MBIA CORP.\u2019S INSURED CDS LIABILITY WAS $18 MILLION AND $33 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, MBIA CORP. HAD $52 MILLION OF GROSS PAR OUTSTANDING ON AN INSURED CREDIT DERIVATIVE COMPARED WITH $70 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018.  NET GAINS (LOSSES) ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE THE NET LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO UNFAVORABLE MARK-TO-MARKET FLUCTUATIONS ON DERIVATIVES. THE NET GAINS ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO GAINS FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY REVALUATIONS OF LOSS RESERVES ON MEXICAN DENOMINATED POLICIES AS A RESULT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR. THE NET LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO LOSSES FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY REVALUATIONS ON CHILEAN UNIDAD DE FOMENTO DENOMINATED PREMIUM RECEIVABLES DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS FROM THE REVALUATION OF LOSS RESERVES ON MEXICAN AND EURO DENOMINATED POLICIES AS A RESULT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR.  REVENUES OF CONSOLIDATED VIES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, TOTAL REVENUES OF CONSOLIDATED VIES WERE LOSSES OF $9 MILLION COMPARED WITH LOSSES OF $72 MILLION AND $60 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIODS OF 2018. THE INCREASES IN REVENUES OF CONSOLIDATED VIES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECONSOLIDATION OF TWO VIES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 FROM THE ZOHAR BANKRUPTCY SETTLEMENT WHICH RESULTED IN A LOSS OF $93 MILLION. THE LOSS RESULTED FROM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE VIE ASSETS THAT WERE DECONSOLIDATED AND OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE OF SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION RECOVERIES FROM THOSE VIES UNDER INSURANCE ACCOUNTING. WE ELECTED TO RECORD AT FAIR VALUE CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE CONSOLIDATED UNDER ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR CONSOLIDATION OF VIES, AND AS SUCH, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE REFLECTED IN EARNINGS.  LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES OUR INTERNATIONAL AND STRUCTURED FINANCE INSURED PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING INTERNATIONAL AND STRUCTURED FINANCE INSURED OBLIGATIONS. THE LEVEL AND FREQUENCY OF MONITORING OF ANY INSURED OBLIGATION DEPENDS ON THE TYPE, SIZE, RATING AND OUR ASSESSED PERFORMANCE OF THE INSURED ISSUE.

THE DECREASE IN THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018 WAS DUE TO LOWER REFUNDING ACTIVITY IN THE CURRENT YEAR. WE DID NOT DEFER A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 OR 2018. POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS IN THESE PERIODS WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO CEDING COMMISSIONS AND PREMIUM TAXES ON INSTALLMENT POLICIES WRITTEN IN PRIOR PERIODS.  69  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  INTERNATIONAL AND STRUCTURED FINANCE INSURANCE PORTFOLIO EXPOSURES  CREDIT QUALITY  THE CREDIT QUALITY OF OUR INTERNATIONAL AND STRUCTURED FINANCE INSURED PORTFOLIO IS ASSESSED IN THE SAME MANNER AS OUR U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE INSURED PORTFOLIO.

IN ADDITION, AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, MBIA CORP. INSURED $338 MILLION OF CDOS AND RELATED INSTRUMENTS. WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONSIDERABLE INCURRED LOSSES AND FUTURE EXPECTED PAYMENTS IN CERTAIN OF THESE SECTORS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE LOSS RESERVES RECORDED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT OR THAT WE WILL NOT EXPERIENCE LOSSES ON TRANSACTIONS ON WHICH WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO LOSS RESERVES, IN PARTICULAR IF THE ECONOMY DETERIORATES. WE MAY SEEK TO PURCHASE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OBLIGATIONS GUARANTEED BY MBIA CORP. OR SEEK TO COMMUTE POLICIES. THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE EXPOSURE REDUCED, IF ANY, AND THE NATURE OF ANY SUCH ACTIONS WILL DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS, PRICING LEVELS FROM TIME TO TIME, AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. IN SOME CASES, THESE ACTIVITIES MAY RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF LOSS RESERVES, BUT IN ALL CASES THEY ARE INTENDED TO LIMIT OUR ULTIMATE LOSSES AND REDUCE THE FUTURE VOLATILITY IN LOSS DEVELOPMENT ON THE RELATED POLICIES. OUR ABILITY TO PURCHASE GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS AND TO COMMUTE POLICIES WILL DEPEND ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S ASSESSMENT OF AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY.  RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE EXPOSURE  MBIA CORP. INSURES MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (\u201cMBS\u201d) BACKED BY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, INCLUDING SECOND-LIEN RMBS TRANSACTIONS (REVOLVING HOME EQUITY LINES OF CREDIT (\u201cHELOC\u201d) LOANS AND CLOSED-END SECOND (\u201cCES\u201d) MORTGAGES). MBIA CORP. ALSO INSURES MBS BACKED BY FIRST-LIEN ALTERNATIVE A-PAPER(\u201cALT-A\u201d) AND SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS DIRECTLY THROUGH RMBS SECURITIZATIONS. THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE STRESS AND DETERIORATION IN THE MORTGAGE MARKET SINCE 2008 REFLECTED BY HEIGHTENED DELINQUENCIES AND LOSSES, PARTICULARLY RELATED TO MORTGAGE LOANS ORIGINATED DURING 2005, 2006 AND 2007.

U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE AND INTERNATIONAL AND STRUCTURED FINANCE REINSURANCE  REINSURANCE ENABLES THE COMPANY TO CEDE EXPOSURE FOR PURPOSES OF SYNDICATING RISK. THE COMPANY GENERALLY RETAINS THE RIGHT TO REASSUME THE BUSINESS CEDED TO REINSURERS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING A REINSURER\u2019S RATING DOWNGRADE BELOW SPECIFIED THRESHOLDS. CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT INTEND TO USE REINSURANCE TO DECREASE THE INSURED EXPOSURE IN OUR PORTFOLIO.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF INSURED PAR OUTSTANDING CEDED BY MBIA TO REINSURERS UNDER REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS WAS $2.0 BILLION COMPARED WITH $2.2 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018. UNDER NATIONAL\u2019S REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WITH MBIA CORP., IF A REINSURER OF MBIA CORP. IS UNABLE TO PAY CLAIMS CEDED BY MBIA CORP.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY\u2019S VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST ITS NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET WAS $839 MILLION AND $834 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON ITS NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT MAY BE ABLE TO USE SOME OF ITS NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET BEFORE THE EXPIRATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ASSET BASED UPON EXPECTED EARNINGS AT NATIONAL AND POTENTIAL FUTURE SOURCES OF TAXABLE INCOME TO BE IDENTIFIED BY THE COMPANY. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO RE-EVALUATE ITS NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.

FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, NATIONAL HAD A STATUTORY NET LOSS OF $52 MILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, NATIONAL\u2019S UNASSIGNED SURPLUS WAS $1.3 BILLION.  IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ITS NEW YORK STATE FINANCIAL GUARANTEE INSURANCE LICENSE, NATIONAL IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM OF $65 MILLION OF POLICYHOLDERS\u2019 SURPLUS. NATIONAL IS ALSO REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN CONTINGENCY RESERVES TO PROVIDE PROTECTION TO POLICYHOLDERS IN THE EVENT OF EXTREME LOSSES IN ADVERSE ECONOMIC EVENTS.  NEW YORK INSURANCE LAW (\u201cNYIL\u201d) REGULATES THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY FINANCIAL GUARANTEE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND PROVIDES THAT SUCH COMPANIES MAY NOT DECLARE OR DISTRIBUTE DIVIDENDS EXCEPT OUT OF STATUTORY EARNED SURPLUS. UNDER NYIL, THE SUM OF (I) THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED OR DISTRIBUTED DURING THE PRECEDING 12-MONTH PERIOD AND (II) THE DIVIDEND TO BE DECLARED MAY NOT EXCEED THE LESSER OF (A) 10% OF POLICYHOLDERS\u2019 SURPLUS, AS REPORTED IN THE LATEST STATUTORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR (B) 100% OF ADJUSTED NET INVESTMENT INCOME FOR SUCH 12-MONTH PERIOD (THE NET INVESTMENT INCOME FOR SUCH 12-MONTH PERIOD PLUS THE EXCESS, IF ANY, OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME OVER DIVIDENDS DECLARED OR DISTRIBUTED DURING THE TWO-YEAR PERIOD PRECEDING SUCH 12-MONTH PERIOD), UNLESS THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NYSDFS APPROVES A GREATER DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION BASED UPON A FINDING THAT THE INSURER WILL RETAIN SUFFICIENT SURPLUS TO SUPPORT ITS OBLIGATIONS.  NATIONAL HAD POSITIVE EARNED SURPLUS AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, FROM WHICH IT MAY PAY DIVIDENDS, SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE. WE EXPECT THE AS-OF-RIGHT DECLARED AND PAID DIVIDEND AMOUNTS FROM NATIONAL TO BE LIMITED TO PRIOR YEAR NET INVESTMENT INCOME FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  72  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2.

MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION  CAPITAL AND SURPLUS  MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION HAD STATUTORY CAPITAL OF $499 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED WITH $555 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, STATUTORY CAPITAL COMPRISED $301 MILLION OF POLICYHOLDERS\u2019 SURPLUS AND $198 MILLION OF CONTINGENCY RESERVES. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION HAD A STATUTORY NET LOSS OF $42 MILLION. MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION\u2019S POLICYHOLDERS\u2019 SURPLUS INCLUDED NEGATIVE UNASSIGNED SURPLUS OF $1.7 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2019. MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION\u2019S POLICYHOLDERS\u2019 SURPLUS MAY BE FURTHER NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IF FUTURE ADDITIONAL INSURED LOSSES ARE INCURRED.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION RECOGNIZED ESTIMATED RECOVERIES ON A STATUTORY BASIS RELATED TO PUT-BACK CLAIMS AGAINST CREDIT SUISSE, EXCESS SPREAD RECOVERIES ON RMBS AND RECOVERIES RELATED TO CDOS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR THAT WE WILL NOT BE DELAYED IN REALIZING THESE RECOVERIES. REFER TO \u201cNOTE 5: LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES\u201d IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THESE RECOVERIES.  UNDER NYIL, MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A CONTINGENCY RESERVE TO PROVIDE PROTECTION TO POLICYHOLDERS IN THE EVENT OF EXTREME LOSSES IN ADVERSE ECONOMIC EVENTS. THE AMOUNT OF THE RESERVE IS BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF PRINCIPAL INSURED OR PREMIUMS EARNED, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF OBLIGATION (NET OF COLLATERAL, REINSURANCE, REFUNDING, REFINANCINGS AND CERTAIN INSURED SECURITIES). REDUCTIONS IN THE CONTINGENCY RESERVE MAY BE RECOGNIZED BASED ON EXCESS RESERVES AND UNDER CERTAIN STIPULATED CONDITIONS, SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NYSDFS. AS A RESULT OF REGULATORY APPROVED REDUCTIONS, MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION\u2019S CONTINGENCY RESERVES OF $198 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 REPRESENTED RESERVES ON 26 OF THE 197 OUTSTANDING CREDITS INSURED BY MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION.  73  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  CAPITAL RESOURCES (CONTINUED)  IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ITS NEW YORK STATE FINANCIAL GUARANTEE INSURANCE LICENSE, MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM OF $65 MILLION OF POLICYHOLDERS\u2019 SURPLUS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, MBIA CORP. MET THE REQUIRED MINIMUM REQUIREMENT. UNDER NYIL, MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION IS REQUIRED TO INVEST ITS MINIMUM SURPLUS AND CONTINGENCY RESERVES AND 50% OF ITS LOSS RESERVES AND UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVES IN CERTAIN QUALIFYING ASSETS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION MAINTAINED ITS MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF POLICYHOLDERS\u2019 SURPLUS BUT DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH QUALIFYING ASSETS TO SUPPORT ITS CONTINGENCY RESERVES AND 50% OF ITS LOSS RESERVES AND UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS AGGREGATE RISK LIMITS UNDER THE NYIL, BUT WAS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN OF ITS SINGLE RISK LIMITS. IF MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION DOES NOT COMPLY WITH THE ABOVE MENTIONED REQUIREMENTS, THE NYSDFS MAY PREVENT MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION FROM TRANSACTING ANY NEW FINANCIAL GUARANTEE INSURANCE BUSINESS UNTIL IT NO LONGER EXCEEDS THE LIMITATIONS.  IN CONNECTION WITH MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION OBTAINING APPROVAL FROM THE NYSDFS TO RELEASE EXCESS CONTINGENCY RESERVES IN PREVIOUS PERIODS, MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION AGREED THAT IT WOULD NOT PAY ANY DIVIDENDS WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL FROM THE NYSDFS. DUE TO ITS SIGNIFICANT EARNED SURPLUS DEFICIT, MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION HAS NOT HAD THE STATUTORY CAPACITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2009. BASED ON ESTIMATED FUTURE INCOME, MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE ANY STATUTORY CAPACITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS.  THE NYSDFS HAS NOT APPROVED MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION\u2019S REQUESTS TO MAKE INTEREST PAYMENTS ON MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION\u2019S 14% FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE SURPLUS NOTES DUE JANUARY 15, 2033 (THE \u201cSURPLUS NOTES\u201d) SINCE, AND INCLUDING, THE JANUARY 15, 2013 INTEREST PAYMENT. THE NYSDFS HAS CITED BOTH MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION\u2019S LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF \u201cFREE AND DIVISIBLE SURPLUS\u201d AS THE BASIS FOR SUCH NON-APPROVALS. AS OF JULY 15, 2019, THE MOST RECENT SCHEDULED INTEREST PAYMENT DATE, THERE WAS $824 MILLION OF UNPAID INTEREST ON THE PAR AMOUNT OUTSTANDING OF $953 MILLION OF THE SURPLUS NOTES. UNDER SECTION 1307 OF THE NYIL AND THE FISCAL AGENCY AGREEMENT GOVERNING THE SURPLUS NOTES, SURPLUS NOTE PAYMENTS MAY BE MADE ONLY WITH THE PRIOR APPROVAL BY THE NYSDFS AND IF MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION HAS SUFFICIENT \u201cELIGIBLE SURPLUS\u201d, OR AS WE BELIEVE, \u201cFREE AND DIVISIBLE SURPLUS\u201d AS AN APPROPRIATE CALCULATION OF \u201cELIGIBLE SURPLUS.\u201d AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION HAD \u201cFREE AND DIVISIBLE SURPLUS\u201d OF $283 MILLION. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THE NYSDFS WILL APPROVE SURPLUS NOTE PAYMENTS, NOTWITHSTANDING THE SUFFICIENCY OF MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION\u2019S LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE UNPAID INTEREST ON THE SURPLUS NOTES WILL BECOME DUE ON THE FIRST BUSINESS DAY ON OR AFTER WHICH MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION OBTAINS APPROVAL TO PAY SOME OR ALL OF SUCH UNPAID INTEREST. NO INTEREST HAS BEEN ACCRUED OR WILL ACCRUE ON THE DEFERRED INTEREST.  CLAIMS-PAYING RESOURCES (STATUTORY BASIS)  CPR IS A KEY MEASURE OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO MBIA CORP.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  LIQUIDITY  WE USE A LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF WHICH IS TO MATCH LIQUIDITY RESOURCES TO NEEDS. WE MONITOR OUR CASH AND LIQUID ASSET RESOURCES USING CASH FORECASTING AND STRESS-SCENARIO TESTING. MEMBERS OF MBIA\u2019S SENIOR MANAGEMENT MEET REGULARLY TO REVIEW LIQUIDITY METRICS, DISCUSS CONTINGENCY PLANS AND ESTABLISH TARGET LIQUIDITY LEVELS. WE EVALUATE AND MANAGE LIQUIDITY ON A LEGAL-ENTITY BASIS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE LEGAL, REGULATORY AND OTHER LIMITATIONS ON AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY RESOURCES WITHIN THE ENTERPRISE. THE FOLLOWING IS A DISCUSSION OF OUR LIQUIDITY RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR HOLDING COMPANY AND OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES.  NATIONAL LIQUIDITY  THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF CASH AVAILABLE TO NATIONAL ARE.  \u2022  PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST RECEIPTS ON ASSETS HELD IN ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS;  \u2022  RECOVERIES ASSOCIATED WITH INSURANCE LOSS PAYMENTS; AND  \u2022  INSTALLMENT PREMIUMS.  THE PRIMARY USES OF CASH BY NATIONAL ARE.  \u2022  PAYMENTS OF OPERATING EXPENSES, TAXES AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ASSET PURCHASES;  \u2022  LOSS PAYMENTS AND LAE ON INSURED TRANSACTIONS; AND  \u2022  PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, NATIONAL HELD CASH AND INVESTMENTS OF $3.3 BILLION AND $3.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH $834 MILLION AND $488 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS COMPRISED OF HIGHLY RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER, MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND MUNICIPAL, U.S. AGENCY AND CORPORATE BONDS.  THE INSURANCE POLICIES ISSUED OR REINSURED BY NATIONAL PROVIDE UNCONDITIONAL AND IRREVOCABLE GUARANTEES OF PAYMENTS OF THE PRINCIPAL OF, AND INTEREST OR OTHER AMOUNTS OWING ON, INSURED OBLIGATIONS WHEN DUE. IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT IN PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL, INTEREST OR OTHER INSURED AMOUNTS BY AN ISSUER, NATIONAL GENERALLY PROMISES TO MAKE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE INSURED AMOUNT WITHIN ONE TO THREE BUSINESS DAYS FOLLOWING NOTIFICATION. IN SOME CASES, THE AMOUNT DUE CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL, PARTICULARLY IF THE DEFAULT OCCURS ON A TRANSACTION TO WHICH NATIONAL HAS A LARGE NOTIONAL EXPOSURE OR ON A TRANSACTION STRUCTURED WITH LARGE, BULLET-TYPE PRINCIPAL MATURITIES. THE U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE INSURANCE SEGMENT\u2019S FINANCIAL GUARANTEE CONTRACTS GENERALLY CANNOT BE ACCELERATED BY A PARTY OTHER THAN THE INSURER WHICH HELPS TO MITIGATE LIQUIDITY RISK IN THIS SEGMENT.  CORPORATE LIQUIDITY  THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF CASH AVAILABLE TO MBIA INC. ARE.  \u2022  DIVIDENDS FROM NATIONAL;  \u2022  RELEASE OF FUNDS UNDER THE TAX SHARING AGREEMENT;  \u2022  AVAILABLE CASH AND LIQUID ASSETS NOT SUBJECT TO COLLATERAL POSTING REQUIREMENTS;  \u2022  PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST RECEIPTS ON ASSETS HELD IN ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS; AND  \u2022  ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS.  THE PRIMARY USES OF CASH BY MBIA INC. ARE.  \u2022  SERVICING OUTSTANDING UNSECURED CORPORATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND MTNS;  \u2022  MEETING COLLATERAL POSTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER INVESTMENT AGREEMENTS AND DERIVATIVE ARRANGEMENTS;  \u2022  PAYMENTS RELATED TO INTEREST RATE SWAPS;  \u2022  PAYMENTS OF OPERATING EXPENSES; AND  \u2022  FUNDING SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT BUYBACKS.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE LIQUIDITY POSITIONS OF MBIA INC. WERE $407 MILLION AND $457 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND INCLUDED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS COMPRISED OF HIGHLY RATED COMMERCIAL PAPER AND U.S. GOVERNMENT AND ASSET-BACKED BONDS.  75  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  LIQUIDITY (CONTINUED)  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, $91 MILLION WAS RELEASED FROM THE TAX ESCROW ACCOUNT TO MBIA INC., OF WHICH $56 MILLION WAS IN CASH, RELATED TO DEPOSITS MADE BY NATIONAL FOR THE 2016 TAX YEAR. ALSO, $5 MILLION WAS RETURNED TO NATIONAL AS A RESULT OF CAPITAL LOSSES INCURRED IN 2018 THAT CAN BE CARRIED BACK TO PRIOR YEARS. THE RELEASES WERE PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE TAX SHARING AGREEMENT FOLLOWING THE EXPIRATION OF NATIONAL\u2019S TWO-YEAR NOL CARRY-BACK PERIOD UNDER U.S. TAX RULES. IN ADDITION TO RELEASES OR RETURNS FOLLOWING THE EXPIRATION OF NATIONAL\u2019S TWO-YEAR NOL CARRY-BACK PERIOD, FROM TIME TO TIME, MBIA INC. IS PERMITTED TO WITHDRAW ASSETS FROM THE TAX ESCROW ACCOUNT IF THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF ALL ASSETS HELD IN THE TAX ESCROW ACCOUNT EXCEEDS THE REQUIRED MINIMUM BALANCE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER THE TAX ESCROW ACCOUNT FROM SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE RELEASED TO MBIA INC. DUE TO DEDUCTIBLE OR CREDITABLE TAX ATTRIBUTES OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES AND/OR THE MARKET VALUE PERFORMANCE OF THE ASSETS SUPPORTING THE TAX ESCROW ACCOUNT.  BASED ON OUR PROJECTIONS OF NATIONAL\u2019S AND MBIA CORP.\u2019S FUTURE EARNINGS AND LOSSES, WE EXPECT THAT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE NATIONAL WILL BE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF PAYMENTS TO MBIA INC. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF ANY SUCH FUTURE DIVIDENDS OR PAYMENTS FROM THE TAX ESCROW ACCOUNT UNDER THE TAX SHARING AGREEMENT. ALSO, ABSENT A SPECIAL DIVIDEND SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE NYSDFS, WE EXPECT THE DECLARED AND PAID DIVIDEND AMOUNTS FROM NATIONAL TO BE LIMITED TO THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS OF NET INVESTMENT INCOME AS REPORTED IN ITS MOST RECENT STATUTORY FILING. REFER TO THE \u201cCAPITAL RESOURCES \u2013 INSURANCE STATUTORY CAPITAL\u201d SECTION FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS. WE DO NOT EXPECT MBIA INC. TO RECEIVE DISTRIBUTIONS FROM MBIA CORP.  CURRENTLY, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE CASH AND SECURITIES HELD BY MBIA INC. IS PLEDGED AGAINST INVESTMENT AGREEMENT LIABILITIES, THE ASSET SWAP (SIMULTANEOUS REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT) AND DERIVATIVES, WHICH LIMITS ITS ABILITY TO RAISE LIQUIDITY THROUGH ASSET SALES. AS THE MARKET VALUE OR RATING ELIGIBILITY OF THE ASSETS WHICH ARE PLEDGED AGAINST MBIA INC.\u2019S OBLIGATIONS DECLINES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PLEDGE ADDITIONAL ELIGIBLE ASSETS IN ORDER TO MEET MINIMUM REQUIRED COLLATERAL AMOUNTS AGAINST THESE LIABILITIES. TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN CASH AND LIQUIDITY RESOURCES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MAKE ALL PAYMENTS DUE ON OUR OBLIGATIONS AND TO MEET OTHER FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS POSTING COLLATERAL. CONTINGENT LIQUIDITY RESOURCES INCLUDE: (1) SALES OF INVESTED ASSETS EXPOSED TO CREDIT SPREAD STRESS RISK, WHICH MAY OCCUR AT LOSSES; (2) TERMINATION AND SETTLEMENT OF INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS; AND (3) ACCESSING THE CAPITAL MARKETS. THESE ACTIONS, IF TAKEN, ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN EITHER ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY OR REDUCED EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE CREDIT SPREAD MOVEMENTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE ACTIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY MITIGATE THIS RISK.  MBIA CORP. LIQUIDITY  THE PRIMARY SOURCES OF CASH AVAILABLE TO MBIA CORP. ARE.  \u2022  RECOVERIES ASSOCIATED WITH INSURANCE LOSS PAYMENTS;  \u2022  INSTALLMENT PREMIUMS AND FEES; AND  \u2022  PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST RECEIPTS ON ASSETS HELD IN ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS.  THE PRIMARY USES OF CASH BY MBIA CORP. ARE.  \u2022  LOSS AND LAE OR COMMUTATION PAYMENTS ON INSURED TRANSACTIONS;  \u2022  REPAYMENT OF THE FACILITY; AND  \u2022  PAYMENTS OF OPERATING EXPENSES.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, MBIA CORP. HELD CASH AND INVESTMENTS OF $239 MILLION AND $242 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH $135 MILLION AND $145 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OR LIQUID INVESTMENTS COMPRISED OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND MUNICIPAL, U.S. AGENCY AND CORPORATE BONDS THAT WERE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE TO MBIA INSURANCE CORPORATION.  INSURED TRANSACTIONS THAT REQUIRE PAYMENT IN FULL OF THE PRINCIPAL INSURED AT MATURITY COULD PRESENT LIQUIDITY RISK FOR MBIA CORP. AS ANY SALVAGE RECOVERIES FROM SUCH PAYMENTS COULD BE RECOVERED OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. MBIA CORP. IS GENERALLY REQUIRED TO SATISFY CLAIMS WITHIN ONE TO THREE BUSINESS DAYS, AND AS A RESULT SEEKS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CLAIMS IN ADVANCE THROUGH OUR MONITORING PROCESS. IN ORDER TO MONITOR LIQUIDITY RISK AND MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE LIQUIDITY RESOURCES, WE USE THE SAME METHODOLOGY AS WE USE TO MONITOR CREDIT QUALITY AND LOSSES WITHIN OUR INSURED PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING STRESS SCENARIOS. REFER TO \u201cNOTE 5: LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES\u201d IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR LOSS PROCESS.  76  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  LIQUIDITY (CONTINUED)  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, MBIA CORP. COLLECTED $80 MILLION FROM INSURED RMBS TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO EXCESS SPREAD RECOVERIES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, MBIA CORP. HAS EXPECTED EXCESS SPREAD RECOVERIES OF $178 MILLION, INCLUDING RECOVERIES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED VIES. MBIA CORP. HAS ALSO RECORDED EXPECTED RECOVERY AMOUNTS RELATED TO ITS CLAIMS AGAINST CREDIT SUISSE FOR INELIGIBLE MORTGAGE LOANS AND RECOVERIES RELATED TO CDOS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL OR NOT BE DELAYED IN REALIZING THESE RECOVERIES.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, MBIA CORP. REQUESTED AND WAS GRANTED PERMISSION BY THE NYSDFS TO PREPAY APPROXIMATELY $74 MILLION OF THE FACILITY.  MBIA CORP. FINANCING FACILITY  IN CONNECTION WITH THE REFINANCED FACILITY, ORIGINAL NOTES ISSUED BY MZ FUNDING ON JANUARY 10, 2017 (THE \u201cORIGINAL MZ FUNDING NOTES\u201d) WERE REDEEMED OR AMENDED, AS APPLICABLE, AND THE SENIOR LENDERS PURCHASED NEW SENIOR NOTES ISSUED BY MZ FUNDING (THE \u201cINSURED SENIOR NOTES\u201d) WITH AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $278 MILLION. IN ADDITION, MBIA INC. RECEIVED AMENDED SUBORDINATED NOTES ISSUED BY MZ FUNDING (THE \u201cINSURED SUBORDINATED NOTES\u201d AND TOGETHER WITH THE INSURED SENIOR NOTES, THE \u201cNEW MZ FUNDING NOTES\u201d) WITH AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $54 MILLION (WITH THE NEW MZ FUNDING NOTES REPLACING THE ORIGINAL MZ FUNDING NOTES). THE NEW MZ FUNDING NOTES MATURE ON JANUARY 20, 2022 AND BEAR INTEREST AT 12% PER ANNUM, PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ARREARS. INTEREST ON THE NEW MZ FUNDING NOTES ARE PAYABLE IN CASH, BUT MAY BE PAYABLE IN KIND AT THE OPTION OF MBIA CORP.; HOWEVER, PROCEEDS OF, OR RECOVERIES ON, THE COLLATERAL AND THE CASH SWEEP AMOUNT (REFERRED TO BELOW) MUST BE USED TO PAY INTEREST OR PRINCIPAL IN CASH.  MZ FUNDING AND MBIA CORP. ARE PARTIES TO A CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cORIGINAL CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) ENTERED INTO ON THE DATE OF ISSUANCE OF THE ORIGINAL MZ FUNDING NOTES, PURSUANT TO WHICH MZ FUNDING LENT THE PROCEEDS OF THE ORIGINAL MZ FUNDING NOTES TO MBIA CORP. IN CONNECTION WITH THE REFINANCE TRANSACTION, MZ FUNDING AND MBIA CORP. ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cNEW CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d AND THE LOANS THEREUNDER, THE \u201cMBIA LOANS\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH MZ FUNDING LENT THE PROCEEDS OF THE NEW MZ FUNDING NOTES TO MBIA CORP. TO REFINANCE THE ORIGINAL CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE MATURITY DATE OF THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE NEW MZ FUNDING NOTES IS JANUARY 20, 2022. THE MBIA CORP. POLICIES UNCONDITIONALLY AND IRREVOCABLY GUARANTEE THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS UNDER THE NEW MZ FUNDING NOTES, WHICH OBLIGATIONS ARE PARI PASSU WITH THE OTHER INSURANCE POLICY OBLIGATIONS OF MBIA CORP., REPLACING THE POLICIES THAT HAD BEEN ISSUED ON THE ORIGINAL MZ FUNDING NOTES. THE MBIA CORP. POLICIES ARE HELD FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL HOLDERS OF THE NEW MZ FUNDING NOTES, THE BENEFIT OF WHICH IS AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTION TO ANY NEW HOLDER WHEN SUCH NEW MZ FUNDING NOTES ARE TRANSFERRED.  THE REFINANCED FACILITY IS SECURED BY A FIRST PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN ALL OF MBIA CORP.\u2019S RIGHT, TITLE AND INTEREST IN THE RECOVERY OF ITS CLAIMS FROM THE ASSETS OF ZOHAR I AND ZOHAR II WHICH INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LOANS MADE TO, AND EQUITY INTERESTS IN, CERTAIN PORTFOLIO COMPANIES PURPORTEDLY CONTROLLED BY THE SPONSOR AND FORMER COLLATERAL MANAGER OF ZOHAR I AND ZOHAR II (THE \u201cZOHAR SPONSOR\u201d) AND CLAIMS THAT MAY EXIST AGAINST THE ZOHAR SPONSOR. THE MONETIZATION OF THE COLLATERAL IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN, AMONG OTHER PARTIES, MBIA CORP., THE ZOHAR SPONSOR, AND THE ZOHAR DEBTORS, WHICH WAS FILED WITH AND APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE PRESIDING OVER THE CHAPTER 11 CASES OF ZOHAR I AND ZOHAR II.  IF AT THE END OF ANY FISCAL QUARTER, MBIA CORP\u2019S \u201cAVAILABLE LIQUIDITY\u201d (AS DEFINED IN THE REFINANCED FACILITY) EXCEEDS $100 MILLION AND MBIA CORP.\u2019S \u201cSTATUTORY SURPLUS\u201d (AS DEFINED IN THE REFINANCED FACILITY) EXCEEDS $250 MILLION, MBIA CORP. WILL MAKE A PAYMENT, SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL, OR NON-DISAPPROVAL, OF THE NYSDFS ON THE MBIA LOANS IN THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY EXCEEDS $100 MILLION. ANY REPAYMENT OF ORIGINAL PRINCIPAL ON THE MBIA LOANS DURING THE FIRST 12 MONTHS WILL BE SUBJECT TO A MAKE-WHOLE PAYMENT, WHICH EFFECTIVELY ENSURES THAT THE SENIOR LENDERS ARE ENTITLED TO 12% INTEREST ON THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE INSURED SENIOR NOTES FOR ONE YEAR. AT ANY TIME THAT THE MBIA LOANS ARE REPAID, MZ FUNDING IS REQUIRED TO APPLY THE REPAYMENT FIRST TO THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL ON THE INSURED SENIOR NOTES AND, AFTER THE INSURED SENIOR NOTES ARE PAID IN FULL, TO THE PAYMENT OF THE INSURED SUBORDINATED NOTES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REIMBURSEMENTS PAYABLE TO MBIA CORP.  77  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENTS IS BASED ON PRICES WHICH INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND PRICES BASED ON MARKET-BASED INPUTS THAT ARE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OBSERVABLE, AS WELL AS PRICES FROM DEALERS IN RELEVANT MARKETS. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FAIR VALUE AND AMORTIZED COST ARISE PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND GENERAL MARKET CREDIT SPREADS OCCURRING AFTER A FIXED-INCOME SECURITY IS PURCHASED, ALTHOUGH OTHER FACTORS MAY ALSO INFLUENCE FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING SPECIFIC CREDIT-RELATED CHANGES, SUPPLY AND DEMAND FORCES AND OTHER MARKET FACTORS. WHEN THE COMPANY HOLDS AN AFS INVESTMENT TO MATURITY, ANY UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS CURRENTLY RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN THE SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY SECTION OF THE BALANCE SHEET IS REVERSED. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY WOULD REALIZE A VALUE SUBSTANTIALLY EQUAL TO AMORTIZED COST. HOWEVER, WHEN INVESTMENTS ARE SOLD PRIOR TO MATURITY, THE COMPANY WILL REALIZE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AMORTIZED COST AND THE SALE PRICE OF AN INVESTMENT AS A REALIZED GAIN OR LOSS WITHIN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  79  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE CREDIT QUALITY RATINGS AND PERCENTAGE OF INVESTMENT GRADE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S AFS FIXED-MATURITY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS, EXCLUDING SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, ARE PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.

(\u201cCOMPANY-INSURED INVESTMENTS\u201d). WHEN PURCHASING INSURED INVESTMENTS, THE COMPANY\u2019S THIRD-PARTY PORTFOLIO MANAGER INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSES THE UNDERLYING CREDIT QUALITY, STRUCTURE AND LIQUIDITY OF EACH INVESTMENT, IN ADDITION TO THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE INSURER. INSURED INVESTMENTS ARE DIVERSE BY SECTOR, ISSUER AND SIZE OF HOLDING. THE THIRD-PARTY PORTFOLIO MANAGER ASSIGNS UNDERLYING RATINGS TO INSURED INVESTMENTS WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO FINANCIAL GUARANTEES BASED ON UNDERLYING RATINGS ASSIGNED BY MOODY\u2019S OR S&P, WHEN A RATING IS NOT PUBLISHED BY MOODY\u2019S. WHEN A MOODY\u2019S OR S&P UNDERLYING RATING IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE UNDERLYING RATING IS BASED ON THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER\u2019S BEST ESTIMATE OF THE RATING OF SUCH INVESTMENT. A DOWNGRADE OF A FINANCIAL GUARANTEE INSURER HAS HISTORICALLY HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS INSURED BY THE DOWNGRADED FINANCIAL GUARANTEE INSURER. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF INSURED INVESTMENTS ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY WILL RECORD A REALIZED LOSS THROUGH EARNINGS.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, INSURED INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE REPRESENTED $201 MILLION OR 5% OF CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS, OF WHICH $177 MILLION OR 5% OF CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS WERE COMPANY-INSURED INVESTMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, BASED ON THE ACTUAL OR ESTIMATED UNDERLYING RATINGS OF OUR CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE RATING OF ONLY THE INSURED INVESTMENTS IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WOULD BE IN THE BAA RANGE. WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE NATIONAL AND MBIA CORP. GUARANTEES OF THE COMPANY-INSURED INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, BASED ON ACTUAL OR ESTIMATED UNDERLYING RATINGS, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE RATING OF THE CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WAS IN THE AA RANGE. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE RATING OF ONLY THE COMPANY-INSURED INVESTMENTS WAS IN THE BAA RANGE, AND INVESTMENTS RATED BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE IN THE COMPANY-INSURED INVESTMENTS WERE 3% OF THE TOTAL CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD A TAX PROVISION OF $3.5 MILLION COMPARED TO $3.3 MILLION IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  \u200b  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS  \u200b  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS DECREASED $2.4 MILLION TO $5.4 MILLION, COMPARED TO $7.8 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  THE DECREASE WAS  71  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NON-RECURRENCE OF A MINORITY INVESTOR\u2019S SHARE OF THE GAIN FROM AN INVESTING AND SERVICING SEGMENT OPERATING PROPERTY SOLD DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  \u200b  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  \u200b  COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL LENDING SEGMENT  \u200b  REVENUES  \u200b  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, REVENUES OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL LENDING SEGMENT INCREASED $55.4 MILLION TO $362.6 MILLION, COMPARED TO $307.2 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO  INCREASES IN INTEREST INCOME FROM LOANS OF $34.4 MILLION AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF $20.9 MILLION.  THE INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME FROM LOANS WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO (I) INCREASED LIBOR RATES AND (II) HIGHER AVERAGE BALANCES OF BOTH COMMERCIAL LOANS AND RESIDENTIAL LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY (III) THE COMPRESSION OF INTEREST RATE SPREADS IN CREDIT MARKETS AND (IV) LOWER LEVELS OF PREPAYMENT RELATED INCOME.  THE INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME FROM INVESTMENT SECURITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE INVESTMENT BALANCES.  \u200b  COSTS AND EXPENSES  \u200b  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COSTS AND EXPENSES OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL LENDING SEGMENT INCREASED $28.6 MILLION TO $138.2 MILLION, COMPARED TO $109.6 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $53.3 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE VARIOUS SECURED FINANCING FACILITIES USED TO FUND A PORTION OF THIS SEGMENT\u2019S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $24.7 MILLION DECREASE IN LOAN LOSS PROVISION PRINCIPALLY RELATING TO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON CERTAIN COMMERCIAL LOANS IN THE 2018 SECOND QUARTER.  \u200b  NET INTEREST INCOME (AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  JUNE 30,  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  2019  2018  CHANGE  INTEREST INCOME FROM LOANS  \u200b  $317,666  \u200b  $283,240  \u200b  $34,426  INTEREST INCOME FROM INVESTMENT SECURITIES  \u200b  44,275  \u200b  23,369  \u200b  20,906  INTEREST EXPENSE  \u200b  (120,168)  \u200b  (66,847)  \u200b  (53,321)  NET INTEREST INCOME  \u200b  $241,773  \u200b  $239,762  \u200b  $2,011  \u200b  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, NET INTEREST INCOME OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL LENDING SEGMENT INCREASED $2.0 MILLION TO $241.8 MILLION, COMPARED TO $239.8 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  THIS INCREASE REFLECTS THE NET INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME EXPLAINED IN THE  REVENUES  DISCUSSION ABOVE, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE ON OUR SECURED FINANCING FACILITIES.  \u200b  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE UNLEVERED YIELDS ON THE COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL LENDING SEGMENT\u2019S LOANS AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES WERE AS FOLLOWS.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  JUNE 30,  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  2019  \u200b  2018  \u200b  COMMERCIAL  \u200b  7.6%  7.7%  RESIDENTIAL  \u200b  6.8%  6.8%  OVERALL  \u200b  7.5%  7.6%  \u200b  THE OVERALL WEIGHTED AVERAGE UNLEVERED YIELD WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER AS INCREASES IN LIBOR WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE COMPRESSION OF INTEREST RATE SPREADS IN CREDIT MARKETS AND LOWER LEVELS OF PREPAYMENT RELATED INCOME.  \u200b  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, THE COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL LENDING SEGMENT\u2019S WEIGHTED AVERAGE SECURED BORROWING RATES, INCLUSIVE OF INTEREST RATE HEDGING COSTS AND THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING FEES, WERE 4.6% AND 4.2%, RESPECTIVELY, AND 4.5% AND 4.2%, RESPECTIVELY, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF BRIDGE  72  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCING. THE INCREASES IN BORROWING RATES PRIMARILY REFLECT INCREASES IN LIBOR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE COMPRESSION OF INTEREST RATE SPREADS IN CREDIT MARKETS.  \u200b  OTHER INCOME  \u200b  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, OTHER INCOME OF OUR COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL LENDING SEGMENT DECREASED $3.1 MILLION TO $7.8 MILLION, COMPARED TO $10.9 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO (I) A $12.4 MILLION UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN GAIN (LOSS) ON DERIVATIVES AND (II) A $2.0 MILLION UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY GAIN (LOSS), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY (III) A $5.8 MILLION NET FAVORABLE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND (IV) A $2.8 MILLION INCREASE IN EARNINGS FROM UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES.  THE UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN GAIN (LOSS) ON DERIVATIVES REFLECTS A $15.5 MILLION UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN INTEREST RATE SWAPS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $3.1 MILLION HIGHER GAIN ON FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES.  THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE USED PRIMARILY TO FIX OUR INTEREST RATE PAYMENTS ON CERTAIN VARIABLE RATE BORROWINGS WHICH FUND FIXED RATE INVESTMENTS.  THE FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES ARE USED TO FIX THE U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF CASH FLOWS (BOTH INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS) WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE FROM OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED LOANS AND CMBS INVESTMENTS.  THE HIGHER GAIN ON THE FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES AND THE UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY GAIN (LOSS) REFLECT THE OVERALL STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE POUND STERLING (\u201cGBP\u201d) IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 VERSUS A LESSER STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018.  \u200b  INFRASTRUCTURE LENDING SEGMENT  \u200b  THE INFRASTRUCTURE LENDING SEGMENT WAS ACQUIRED ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2018.

OUR MANAGEMENT USES CORE EARNINGS IN THIS WAY, AND ALSO USES CORE EARNINGS TO COMPUTE THE INCENTIVE FEE DUE UNDER OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS INVESTORS ALSO USE CORE EARNINGS OR A COMPARABLE SUPPLEMENTAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY AND ITS PEERS, AND AS SUCH, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE DISCLOSURE OF CORE EARNINGS IS USEFUL TO (AND EXPECTED BY) ITS INVESTORS.  \u200b  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CAUTIONS THAT CORE EARNINGS DOES NOT REPRESENT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET INCOME (DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP), OR AN INDICATION OF OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES (DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP), A MEASURE OF OUR LIQUIDITY, OR AN INDICATION OF FUNDS AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR CASH NEEDS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING CORE EARNINGS MAY DIFFER FROM THE METHODOLOGIES EMPLOYED BY OTHER REITS TO CALCULATE THE SAME OR SIMILAR SUPPLEMENTAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES, AND ACCORDINGLY, OUR REPORTED CORE EARNINGS MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THE CORE EARNINGS REPORTED BY OTHER REITS.  \u200b  THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE DILUTED SHARE COUNT APPLIED TO CORE EARNINGS FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING CORE EARNINGS PER SHARE (\u201cEPS\u201d) IS COMPUTED USING THE GAAP DILUTED SHARE COUNT, ADJUSTED FOR THE FOLLOWING.  \u200b  (I)  UNVESTED STOCK AWARDS \u2013 CURRENTLY, UNVESTED STOCK AWARDS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE DENOMINATOR OF GAAP EPS.  THE RELATED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS ALSO EXCLUDED FROM CORE EARNINGS.  IN ORDER TO EFFECTUATE DILUTION FROM THESE AWARDS IN THE CORE EARNINGS COMPUTATION, WE ADJUST THE GAAP DILUTED SHARE COUNT TO INCLUDE THESE SHARES.  \u200b  (II)  CONVERTIBLE NOTES \u2013 CONVERSION OF OUR CONVERTIBLE NOTES IS AN EVENT THAT IS CONTINGENT UPON NUMEROUS FACTORS, NONE OF WHICH ARE IN OUR CONTROL, AND IS AN EVENT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT OCCUR.

WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO PAY REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS IN AN AMOUNT APPROXIMATING OUR NET TAXABLE INCOME, IF AND TO THE EXTENT AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. BEFORE WE PAY ANY DIVIDEND, WHETHER FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES OR OTHERWISE, WE MUST FIRST MEET BOTH OUR OPERATING AND DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS. IF OUR CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION IS LESS THAN OUR NET TAXABLE INCOME, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO SELL ASSETS OR BORROW FUNDS TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS OR WE MAY MAKE A PORTION OF THE REQUIRED DISTRIBUTION IN THE FORM OF A TAXABLE STOCK DISTRIBUTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF DEBT SECURITIES.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  NATIONAL HEALTH INVESTORS, INC., ESTABLISHED IN 1991 AS A MARYLAND CORPORATION, IS A SELF-MANAGED REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (\u201cREIT\u201d) SPECIALIZING IN SALE-LEASEBACK, JOINT-VENTURE, MORTGAGE AND MEZZANINE FINANCING OF NEED-DRIVEN AND DISCRETIONARY SENIOR HOUSING  AND MEDICAL FACILITY INVESTMENTS. OUR PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IN INDEPENDENT LIVING FACILITIES, ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES, ENTRANCE-FEE COMMUNITIES, SENIOR LIVING CAMPUSES, SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES, SPECIALTY HOSPITALS AND MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDINGS. WE FUND OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY THROUGH: (1) OPERATING CASH FLOW, (2) DEBT OFFERINGS, INCLUDING BANK LINES OF CREDIT AND TERM DEBT, BOTH UNSECURED AND SECURED, AND (3) THE SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES.  PORTFOLIO  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE HAD INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGE AND OTHER NOTES RECEIVABLE INVOLVING  242  FACILITIES LOCATED IN  33  STATES. THESE INVESTMENTS INVOLVE  161  SENIOR HOUSING PROPERTIES,  76  SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES,  3  HOSPITALS,  2  MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDINGS AND OTHER NOTES RECEIVABLE. THESE INVESTMENTS (EXCLUDING OUR CORPORATE OFFICE OF  $2,505,000  ) CONSISTED OF PROPERTIES WITH AN ORIGINAL COST OF APPROXIMATELY  $3,056,215,000  , RENTED UNDER TRIPLE-NET LEASES TO  30  LESSEES, AND  $306,454,000  AGGREGATE NET CARRYING VALUE OF MORTGAGE AND OTHER NOTES RECEIVABLE DUE FROM  11  BORROWERS.  OUR INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES AND OUR INVESTMENTS IN MORTGAGE LOANS ARE SECURED BY REAL ESTATE LOCATED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE MANAGED AS ONE UNIT FOR INTERNAL REPORTING AND DECISION MAKING. THEREFORE, OUR REPORTING REFLECTS OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND OPERATIONS AS A SINGLE SEGMENT.  WE CLASSIFY ALL OF THE PROPERTIES IN OUR PORTFOLIO AS EITHER SENIOR HOUSING OR MEDICAL PROPERTIES. BECAUSE OUR LEASES REPRESENT DIFFERENT UNDERLYING REVENUE SOURCES AND RESULT IN DIFFERING RISK PROFILES, WE FURTHER CLASSIFY OUR SENIOR HOUSING COMMUNITIES AS EITHER NEED-DRIVEN (ASSISTED LIVING AND MEMORY CARE COMMUNITIES AND SENIOR LIVING CAMPUSES) OR DISCRETIONARY (INDEPENDENT LIVING AND ENTRANCE-FEE COMMUNITIES.)  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SENIOR HOUSING \u2013 NEED-DRIVEN  INCLUDES ASSISTED LIVING AND MEMORY CARE COMMUNITIES (\u201cALF\u201d) AND SENIOR LIVING CAMPUSES (\u201cSLC\u201d) WHICH PRIMARILY ATTRACT PRIVATE PAYMENT FOR SERVICES FROM RESIDENTS WHO REQUIRE ASSISTANCE WITH ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. NEED-DRIVEN PROPERTIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY OVERSIGHT.  SENIOR HOUSING \u2013 DISCRETIONARY  INCLUDES INDEPENDENT LIVING (\u201cILF\u201d) AND ENTRANCE-FEE COMMUNITIES (\u201cEFC\u201d) WHICH PRIMARILY ATTRACT PRIVATE PAYMENT FOR SERVICES FROM RESIDENTS WHO ARE MAKING THE LIFESTYLE CHOICE OF LIVING IN AN AGE-RESTRICTED MULTI-FAMILY COMMUNITY THAT OFFERS SOCIAL PROGRAMS, MEALS, HOUSEKEEPING AND IN SOME CASES ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE SERVICES. DISCRETIONARY PROPERTIES ARE SUBJECT TO LIMITED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN DEMAND FOR THIS TYPE OF COMMUNITY AND THE STRENGTH OF THE HOUSING MARKET.  MEDICAL FACILITIES  WITHIN OUR PORTFOLIO RECEIVE PAYMENT PRIMARILY FROM MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND HEALTH INSURANCE. THESE PROPERTIES INCLUDE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES (\u201cSNF\u201d), MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDINGS (\u201cMOB\u201d) AND HOSPITALS THAT ATTRACT PATIENTS WHO HAVE A NEED FOR ACUTE OR COMPLEX MEDICAL ATTENTION, PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE, OR REHABILITATION SERVICES.

AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , OUR AVERAGE EFFECTIVE ANNUALIZED RENTAL INCOME WAS  $8,406  PER BED FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES,  $11,901  PER UNIT FOR SENIOR LIVING CAMPUSES,  $15,916  PER UNIT FOR ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES,  $12,687  PER UNIT FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING FACILITIES,  $22,195  PER UNIT FOR ENTRANCE-FEE COMMUNITIES,  $38,604  PER BED FOR HOSPITALS, AND  $8  PER SQUARE FOOT FOR MEDICAL OFFICE BUILDINGS.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AREAS OF FOCUS  WE ARE EVALUATING AND WILL LIKELY MAKE REAL ESTATE AND NOTE INVESTMENTS DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019 WHILE WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PROPERTIES. WE SEEK TENANTS WHO WILL BECOME MISSION-ORIENTED PARTNERS IN RELATIONSHIPS WHERE OUR BUSINESS GOALS ARE ALIGNED. THIS APPROACH AIMS TO FUEL STEADY, AND THUS, ENDURING GROWTH FOR THOSE PARTNERS AND FOR NHI. WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF OUR GROWTH MODEL, WE RELY ON A COST-EFFECTIVE ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL TO FINANCE ACQUISITIONS THAT WILL DRIVE OUR EARNINGS. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FOR HEALTHCARE ASSETS FROM OTHER REITS, BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, AND FROM PRIVATE EQUITY SOURCES. LARGE-SCALE PORTFOLIOS CONTINUE TO COMMAND PREMIUM PRICING, DUE TO THE CONTINUED ABUNDANCE OF PRIVATE AND FOREIGN BUYERS SEEKING TO INVEST IN HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE. THIS COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES PLACES A PREMIUM ON OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE ACQUISITIONS AND NEGOTIATE LEASES THAT WILL GENERATE MEANINGFUL EARNINGS GROWTH FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS. WE EMPHASIZE GROWTH WITH OUR EXISTING TENANTS AND BORROWERS AS A WAY TO INSULATE US FROM OTHER COMPETITION.  WITH LOWER CAPITALIZATION RATES FOR EXISTING HEALTHCARE FACILITIES, THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED INTEREST IN CONSTRUCTING NEW FACILITIES IN HOPES OF GENERATING BETTER RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL. USING OUR RELATIONSHIP-DRIVEN MODEL, WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT NEW AND EXISTING TENANTS AND BORROWERS WITH THE CAPITAL NEEDED TO EXPAND EXISTING FACILITIES AND TO INITIATE GROUND-UP DEVELOPMENT OF NEW FACILITIES. WE CONCENTRATE OUR EFFORTS IN THOSE MARKETS WHERE THERE IS BOTH A DEMONSTRATED DEMAND FOR A PARTICULAR PRODUCT TYPE AND WHERE WE PERCEIVE WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.  THE PROJECTS WE AGREE TO FINANCE HAVE ATTRACTIVE UPSIDE POTENTIAL AND ARE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE ABOVE-AVERAGE RETURNS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS TO MITIGATE THE RISKS INHERENT WITH PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION.  FOLLOWING THREE 25 BASIS-POINT INCREASES IN 2017, THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE ANNOUNCED FOUR FURTHER INTEREST RATE INCREASES DURING 2018. ON JULY 31, 2019, THE FEDERAL RESERVE LOWERED ITS BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE 25 BPS TO 2.25% \u2013 THE FIRST REDUCTION SINCE 2008.  THE ACTUAL PATH THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE TAKES WILL DEPEND ON THE CHANGING ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AS INFORMED BY INCOMING DATA. THERE WAS NO MESSAGE FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE THAT INTEREST RATES WOULD BE REDUCED EVEN FURTHER IN THE NEAR TERM OR IF THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF A RATE-CUTTING CYCLE. THE PAST INCREASES IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE HAVE BEEN A PRIMARY SOURCE OF MUCH VOLATILITY IN REIT EQUITY MARKETS. AS A RESULT, THERE HAS BEEN PRESSURE ON THE SPREAD BETWEEN OUR COST OF CAPITAL AND THE RETURNS WE EARN. WE EXPECT THAT PRESSURE TO BE PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY MARKET FORCES THAT WOULD TEND TO RESULT IN HIGHER CAPITALIZATION RATES FOR HEALTHCARE ASSETS AND HIGHER LEASE RATES INDICATIVE OF HISTORICAL LEVELS. OUR COST OF CAPITAL HAS INCREASED OVER THE PAST YEAR AS WE TRANSITION SOME OF OUR SHORT-TERM REVOLVING BORROWINGS INTO DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH LONGER MATURITIES AND FIXED INTEREST RATES. MANAGING LONG-TERM RISK INVOLVES TRADE-OFFS WITH THE COMPETING ALTERNATIVE GOAL OF MAXIMIZING SHORT-TERM PROFITABILITY. OUR INTENTION IS TO STRIKE AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN THESE COMPETING INTERESTS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF OUR INVESTOR PROFILE. AS INTEREST RATES RISE, OUR SHARE PRICE MAY DECLINE AS INVESTORS ADJUST PRICES TO REFLECT A DIVIDEND YIELD THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY IN EXCESS OF A RISK-FREE RATE.  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY  26%  OF OUR REVENUE WAS DERIVED FROM OPERATORS OF OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR REVENUE FROM GOVERNMENTAL PAYORS, PRIMARILY MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. SUCH REVENUES ARE SUBJECT ANNUALLY TO STATUTORY AND REGULATORY CHANGES AND IN RECENT YEARS HAVE BEEN REDUCED DUE TO FEDERAL AND STATE BUDGETARY PRESSURES. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, WE HAVE SELECTIVELY DIVERSIFIED OUR PORTFOLIO BY DIRECTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS INTO PROPERTIES WHICH DO NOT RELY PRIMARILY ON MEDICARE AND MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT, BUT RATHER ON PRIVATE PAY SOURCES (ASSISTED LIVING AND MEMORY CARE FACILITIES, SENIOR LIVING CAMPUSES, INDEPENDENT LIVING FACILITIES AND ENTRANCE-FEE COMMUNITIES). WE WILL OCCASIONALLY ACQUIRE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION WITH A PROVEN OPERATOR AND STRONG LOCAL MARKET FUNDAMENTALS, BECAUSE DIVERSIFICATION IMPLIES A PERIODIC REBALANCING, BUT OUR RECENT INVESTMENT FOCUS HAS BEEN ON ACQUIRING NEED-DRIVEN AND DISCRETIONARY SENIOR HOUSING ASSETS.  FOR INDIVIDUAL TENANT REVENUE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LEASE REVENUE, BICKFORD IS OUR LARGEST ASSISTED LIVING TENANT, AN AFFILIATE OF HOLIDAY IS OUR LARGEST INDEPENDENT LIVING TENANT, NHC IS OUR LARGEST SKILLED NURSING TENANT AND SENIOR LIVING COMMUNITIES IS OUR LARGEST ENTRANCE-FEE COMMUNITY TENANT. OUR SHIFT TOWARD PRIVATE PAYOR FACILITIES, AS WELL AS OUR EXPANSION INTO THE DISCRETIONARY SENIOR HOUSING MARKET, HAS FURTHER RESULTED IN A PORTFOLIO WHOSE CURRENT COMPOSITION IS RELATIVELY BALANCED BETWEEN MEDICAL FACILITIES, NEED-DRIVEN AND DISCRETIONARY SENIOR HOUSING.  WE MANAGE OUR BUSINESS WITH A GOAL OF INCREASING THE REGULAR ANNUAL DIVIDENDS PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS. OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVES A REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND WHICH IS REFLECTIVE OF EXPECTED TAXABLE INCOME ON A RECURRING BASIS. OUR TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE INFREQUENT AND NON-RECURRING THAT GENERATE ADDITIONAL TAXABLE INCOME HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO SHAREHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF SPECIAL DIVIDENDS. TAXABLE INCOME IS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE AND DIFFERS FROM NET INCOME FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PURPOSES DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. OUR GOAL OF INCREASING ANNUAL DIVIDENDS REQUIRES A CAREFUL BALANCE BETWEEN IDENTIFICATION OF HIGH-QUALITY LEASE AND MORTGAGE ASSETS IN WHICH TO INVEST AND THE COST OF OUR CAPITAL WITH WHICH TO FUND SUCH INVESTMENTS. WE CONSIDER THE COMPETING INTERESTS OF SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT (INTEREST RATES, MATURITIES AND OTHER TERMS) VERSUS THE HIGHER COST OF NEW EQUITY. WE ACCEPT SOME LEVEL OF RISK ASSOCIATED WITH  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LEVERAGING OUR INVESTMENTS. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MAKE NEW INVESTMENTS THAT MEET OUR UNDERWRITING CRITERIA AND WHERE THE SPREADS OVER OUR COST OF CAPITAL WILL GENERATE SUFFICIENT RETURNS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE ANNOUNCED AN INCREASE IN OUR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND TO $1.05 PER COMMON SHARE ($4.20 ON AN ANNUAL BASIS). OUR DIVIDENDS PER SHARE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  2018  2017  $4.00  $3.80  OUR INVESTMENTS IN HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY ACCOMPLISHED BY OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY LEVERAGE OUR BALANCE SHEET. HOWEVER, WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A LOWER-LEVERAGE BALANCE SHEET WHEN COMPARED WITH MANY IN OUR PEER GROUP. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, WHICH IS THE RATIO OF ADJUSTED EBITDA (EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, INCLUDING AMOUNTS IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND GAINS ON DISPOSITIONS) TO FIXED CHARGES (INTEREST EXPENSE AT CONTRACTUAL RATES NET OF CAPITALIZED INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON DEBT), AND THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE MEANINGFUL MEASURES OF OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE OUR DEBT. WE USE THESE TWO MEASURES AS A USEFUL BASIS TO COMPARE THE STRENGTH OF OUR BALANCE SHEET WITH THOSE IN OUR PEER GROUP. WE ALSO BELIEVE THIS GIVES US A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE WHEN ACCESSING DEBT MARKETS.  WE CALCULATE OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO AS APPROXIMATELY  5.2X  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  (SEE OUR DISCUSSION UNDER THE HEADING  ADJUSTED EBITDA  INCLUDING A RECONCILIATION TO OUR NET INCOME). GIVING EFFECT TO OUR ACQUISITIONS AND FINANCINGS ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS, OUR CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT TO ANNUALIZED ADJUSTED EBITDA RATIO IS APPROXIMATELY  4.8X  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  (IN THOUSANDS)  .  CONSOLIDATED TOTAL DEBT  $1,471,787  LESS: CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  (5,635  )  CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT  $1,466,152  ADJUSTED EBITDA  $73,519  ANNUALIZING ADJUSTMENT  220,557  ANNUALIZED IMPACT OF RECENT INVESTMENTS  10,184  $304,260  CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT TO ANNUALIZED ADJUSTED EBITDA  4.8  X  ACCORDING TO THE ADMINISTRATION ON AGING (\u201cAOA\u201d) OF THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, IN 2016, THE LATEST YEAR FOR WHICH DATA IS AVAILABLE, 49.2 MILLION PEOPLE WERE AGE 65 OR OLDER IN THE UNITED STATES (A 33% INCREASE OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS). CENSUS ESTIMATES SHOWED THAT, BY 2040, THOSE 65 OR OLDER ARE EXPECTED TO CONSTITUTE 21.7% OF THE POPULATION. THE POPULATION AGED 85 AND ABOVE IS PROJECTED TO RISE FROM 6.4 MILLION IN 2016 TO 14.6 MILLION IN THE US BY 2040 (A 129% INCREASE).  PER THE AOA, IN 2015, THE MEDIAN VALUE OF HOMES OWNED BY OLDER HOMEOWNERS AGE 75 AND OVER WAS $150,000 (WITH A MEDIAN PURCHASE PRICE OF $53,000). IN COMPARISON, THE MEDIAN HOME VALUE OF ALL HOMEOWNERS WAS $180,000. OF THE 11.9 MILLION HOUSEHOLDS HEADED BY PERSONS AGE 75 AND OVER IN 2015, 76% WERE OWNERS. ABOUT 78% OF THESE OLDER HOMEOWNERS IN 2015 OWNED THEIR HOMES FREE AND CLEAR. HOME OWNERSHIP PROVIDES THE ELDERLY WITH GREATER FREEDOM TO CHOOSE THEIR LIFESTYLES.  EQUIPPED WITH THE BASICS OF FINANCIAL SECURITY, MANY WILL BE ECONOMICALLY ABLE TO ENTER THE MARKET FOR SENIOR HOUSING. THESE STRONG DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS PROVIDE THE CONTEXT FOR CONTINUED GROWTH IN SENIOR HOUSING IN 2019 AND THE YEARS AHEAD. WE PLAN TO FUND ANY NEW REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS DURING 2019 USING OUR LIQUID ASSETS AND DEBT FINANCING. AS THE WEIGHT OF ADDITIONAL DEBT RESULTING FROM NEW ACQUISITIONS SUGGESTS THE NEED TO REBALANCE OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE, WE WOULD THEN EXPECT TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS THROUGH AN AT-THE-MARKET (\u201cATM\u201d) OR OTHER EQUITY OFFERING. OUR DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT STRATEGY IMPLEMENTED THROUGH MEASURED INCREMENTS OF DEBT AND EQUITY SETS THE STAGE FOR ACCESS TO CAPITAL AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE RATES, ANNUAL DIVIDEND GROWTH, CONTINUED LOW LEVERAGE, A PORTFOLIO OF DIVERSIFIED, HIGH-QUALITY ASSETS, AND BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXPERIENCED OPERATORS WHOM WE MAKE OUR PRIORITY, CONTINUE TO BE THE KEY DRIVERS OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  SEE OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR A DISCUSSION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INCLUDING THOSE CONCERNING REVENUE RECOGNITION, OUR STATUS AS A REIT, PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION, EVALUATION OF IMPAIRMENTS AND ALLOCATION OF PROPERTY ACQUISITION COSTS.

FOR NHC, RENT ESCALATIONS ARE BASED ON A PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN REVENUE OVER A BASE YEAR AND DO NOT GIVE RISE TO NON-CASH, STRAIGHT-LINE RENTAL INCOME.  BICKFORD  WE ARE CLOSELY MONITORING THE OCCUPANCY AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR MAJOR CUSTOMER BICKFORD. THEIR MANAGEMENT IS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OCCUPANCY IN THE COMPANY\u2019S FACILITIES AND THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL SO FAR IN 2019. BICKFORD IS ALSO AN ACTIVE DEVELOPER OF NEW FACILITIES IN UNDERSERVED MARKETS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE AVERAGE PORTFOLIO OCCUPANCY FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED, EXCLUDING DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES IN OPERATION LESS THAN 24 MONTHS, NOTES RECEIVABLE AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE.

WE HAVE IDENTIFIED EBITDARM (EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, RENT AND MANAGEMENT FEES) AS THE MOST ELEMENTAL BAROMETER OF SUCCESS FOR OUR TENANTS, BASED ON RESULTS THEY HAVE REPORTED TO US. WE BELIEVE EBITDARM IS USEFUL IN OUR MOST FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSES, AS IT IS A PROPERTY LEVEL MEASURE OF OUR OPERATORS\u2019 SUCCESS, BY ELIMINATING THE EFFECTS OF THE OPERATOR\u2019S METHOD OF ACQUIRING THE USE OF ITS ASSETS (INTEREST AND RENT), ITS NON-CASH EXPENSES (DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION), EXPENSES THAT ARE DEPENDENT ON ITS LEVEL OF SUCCESS (INCOME TAXES), AND ALSO EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE OPERATOR\u2019S PAYMENT OF ITS MANAGEMENT FEES, AS TYPICALLY THOSE FEES ARE CONTRACTUALLY SUBORDINATE TO OUR LEASE PAYMENT. FOR OPERATORS OF OUR ENTRANCE-FEE COMMUNITIES, OUR CALCULATION OF EBITDARM INCLUDES OTHER CASH FLOW ADJUSTMENTS TYPICAL OF THE INDUSTRY WHICH MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, NET CASH FLOWS FROM ENTRANCE FEES; AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ENTRANCE FEES; ADJUSTMENTS FOR TENANT RENT OBLIGATIONS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION; AND MANAGEMENT FEE TRUE-UPS. THE ELIMINATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS REFLECT COVENANTS IN OUR LEASES AND PROVIDE A COMPARABLE BASIS FOR ASSESSING OUR VARIOUS RELATIONSHIPS.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE BELIEVE THAT EBITDARM IS A USEFUL WAY TO ANALYZE THE CASH POTENTIAL OF A GROUP OF ASSETS. FROM EBITDARM WE CALCULATE A LEASE COVERAGE RATIO (EBITDARM/CASH RENT), MEASURING THE ABILITY OF THE OPERATOR TO MEET ITS MONTHLY RENTAL OBLIGATION. IN ADDITION TO EBITDARM AND THE LEASE COVERAGE RATIO, WE RELY ON, A CAREFUL BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS, AND OTHER ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES TO HELP US IDENTIFY POTENTIAL AREAS OF CONCERN RELATIVE TO OUR OPERATORS\u2019 ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING THEIR OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE TO PAY THE RENT DUE TO US. TYPICAL AMONG OUR OPERATORS IS A VARYING LAG IN REPORTING TO US THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS. ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO, HOWEVER, OUR OPERATORS REPORT THEIR RESULTS, AT THE LATEST, WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF MONTH\u2019S END. FOR COMPUTATIONAL PURPOSES, WE EXCLUDE DEVELOPMENT AND LEASE-UP PROPERTIES THAT HAVE BEEN IN OPERATION LESS THAN 24 MONTHS AND SELECTED IMMATERIAL PROPERTIES IDENTIFIED IN 2019 AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE. FOR STABILIZED ACQUISITIONS IN THE PORTFOLIO LESS THAN 24 MONTHS AND RENEWING LEASES WITH CHANGES IN SCHEDULED RENT, WE INCLUDE PRO FORMA CASH RENT.

WE USE THE RESULTS OF INDIVIDUAL LEASES TO INFORM OUR DECISION MAKING WITH RESPECT TO SPECIFIC TENANTS, BUT TRENDS DESCRIBED ABOVE BY PROPERTY TYPE AND OPERATOR BEAR ANALYSIS. OUR NEED-DRIVEN SHO PORTFOLIO SHOWS A DECLINE BROUGHT ABOUT PRIMARILY BY A SOFTENING IN OCCUPANCY WITHIN PARTICULAR MARKETS, AS WELL AS RISING WAGE PRESSURES. FOR MANY OF THE AFFECTED OPERATORS, AS IS TYPICAL OF OUR PORTFOLIO IN GENERAL, NHI HAS SIGNIFICANT SECURITY DEPOSITS IN PLACE AND/OR CORPORATE GUARANTEES SHOULD ACTUAL CASH RENTAL SHORTFALLS EVENTUALLY MATERIALIZE. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, OUR OPERATORS MAY ELECT TO INCREASE THEIR SECURITY DEPOSITS WITH US IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE COVERAGE SHORTFALL, AND, UPON SUBSEQUENT COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIRED LEASE COVERAGE RATIO, THE OPERATOR WOULD THEN BE ENTITLED TO A FULL REFUND. THE METRICS PRESENTED IN THE TABLES ABOVE GIVE NO EFFECT TO THE PRESENCE OF THESE SECURITY DEPOSITS. FOR SKILLED NURSING, COVERAGE IN THE ALL OTHER CATEGORY OF OUR PORTFOLIO HAS IMPROVED DUE TO A BETTER OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, AS A WHOLE, AND FOR THE ENSIGN PORTFOLIO TRANSITION, IN PARTICULAR. EACH MOB\u2019S COVERAGE IS DRIVEN BY THE UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE OF ITS ON-CAMPUS HOSPITAL AS THE TENANT OR GUARANTOR UNDER THE LEASE. IN TEXAS, THE AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE HARVEY IN 2017 WITNESSED THE SHUT-DOWN OF THE GUARANTOR HOSPITAL FOR A FEW DAYS RESULTING IN LOST REVENUE, OVERTIME AND OTHER ONE-TIME CHARGES, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE HOSPITAL\u2019S BOTTOM-LINE AND RESULTANT COVERAGE RATIOS FOR THAT MOB. WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THIS EVENT-SPECIFIC OCCURRENCE, IT IS ALSO TYPICAL OF MOB OPERATIONS THAT THERE MAY BE OTHER LARGE FLUCTUATIONS IN COVERAGE RESULTING FROM HOSPITAL OPERATIONS.  POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT  OUR SNF OPERATORS RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR REVENUES FROM GOVERNMENTAL PAYORS, PRIMARILY MEDICARE (FEDERAL) AND MEDICAID (STATES). CHANGES IN REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND LIMITS ON THE SCOPE OF SERVICES REIMBURSED TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE OPERATORS\u2019 LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ON AUGUST 1, 2018, THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (\u201cCMS\u201d) ANNOUNCED THE CMS SKILLED NURSING PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM (\u201cPPS\u201d) FINAL RULE WHEREBY, EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2019, ITS PATIENT-DRIVEN PAYMENT MODEL (\u201cPDPM\u201d) WILL REPLACE RESOURCE UTILIZATION GROUPS (\u201cRUGS\u201d)-IV. FACILITIES WILL HAVE ONE YEAR TO TRANSITION TO PDPM FROM RUGS-IV BY THE OCTOBER 1, 2019 IMPLEMENTATION DATE. PDPM IS DESIGNED AS A MORE SIMPLIFIED PAYMENT MODEL THAN RUGS-IV AND IS PROJECTED TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND FOSTER INNOVATION TO IMPROVE CARE TO PATIENTS. REGULATORS FORECAST A $2 BILLION REDUCTION IN PROVIDER COSTS OVER 10 YEARS AS A RESULT OF SIMPLIFIED PAPERWORK REQUIREMENTS FOR RESIDENT ASSESSMENTS. THE NEW MODEL SHIFTS CARE DELIVERY UNDER MEDICARE AWAY FROM FEE-FOR-SERVICE, WHICH IN THE PAST HAS BASED REIMBURSEMENT ON THE AMOUNT OF CARE PROVIDED, TO FOCUS ON VALUE-BASED CARE, WHICH WILL BASE REIMBURSEMENT ON CLINICAL COMPLEXITY AND THE RESIDENT\u2019S CONDITIONS AND CARE NEEDS. THE FINAL RULE ALSO ESTABLISHED A 2.4% MARKET BASKET INCREASE BEGINNING OCTOBER 1, 2018. ON APRIL 19, 2019, CMS PROPOSED A NET 2.5% INCREASE TO MEDICARE SKILLED NURSING PAYMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING OCTOBER 1, 2019.  WE BELIEVE A RATE INCREASE IN LINE WITH INFLATION, ALONG WITH GENERAL DEMOGRAPHIC GROWTH AMONG THE OLDEST SENIORS, WILL HELP TO STABILIZE LEASE COVERAGES AMONG OUR SKILLED NURSING TENANTS AT A TIME WHEN THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING THE PDPM PAYMENT MODEL.  WE CURRENTLY ESTIMATE THAT OUR BORROWERS AND LESSEES WILL FIND THESE MEDICARE INCREASES TO BE ADEQUATE IN THE NEAR TERM DUE TO THEIR CREDIT QUALITY, PROFITABILITY AND THEIR DEBT OR LEASE COVERAGE RATIOS, ALTHOUGH NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN AS TO WHAT THE ULTIMATE EFFECT THAT PDPM INCREASES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WILL HAVE ON EACH OF OUR BORROWERS AND LESSEES. ACCORDING TO INDUSTRY STUDIES, STATE MEDICAID FUNDING IS NOT EXPECTED TO KEEP PACE WITH INFLATION.

THE BUILDINGS ARE SMALLER THAN ARE TYPICAL OF OUR PORTFOLIO AND ARE NO LONGER CONSIDERED TO BE AN APPROPRIATE INVESTMENT FOR NHI. IN JANUARY WE CEASED RECORDING DEPRECIATION ON THE PROPERTIES, AND WE BOOKED AN ADJUSTMENT TO LEASE REVENUES TO WRITE OFF THE ASSOCIATED  $124,000  IN STRAIGHT-LINE RECEIVABLES. WE RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS OF  $2,500,000  TO WRITE DOWN THE PROPERTIES TO THEIR ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF  $3,745,000  AND HAVE CLASSIFIED THE ASSETS AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT  JUNE 30, 2019.  OTHER  OUR LEASES ARE TYPICALLY STRUCTURED AS \u201cTRIPLE NET LEASES\u201d ON SINGLE-TENANT PROPERTIES HAVING AN INITIAL LEASEHOLD TERM OF 10 TO 15 YEARS WITH ONE OR MORE FIVE-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. AS SUCH, THERE MAY BE REPORTING PERIODS IN WHICH WE EXPERIENCE FEW, IF ANY, LEASE RENEWALS OR EXPIRATIONS. DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT RENEWING OR EXPIRING LEASES.  MOST OF OUR EXISTING LEASES CONTAIN ANNUAL ESCALATORS IN RENT PAYMENTS. FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES, RENTAL INCOME ON OUR OPERATING LEASES IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE. CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATORS HOLD PURCHASE OPTIONS ALLOWING THEM TO ACQUIRE PROPERTIES THEY CURRENTLY LEASE FROM NHI. WE REGULARLY ENGAGE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH THESE TENANTS TO CONTINUE AS LESSOR OR IN SOME OTHER CAPACITY.  WE ADJUST RENTAL INCOME FOR THE AMORTIZATION OF LEASE INDUCEMENTS PAID TO OUR TENANTS. CURRENT OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ARE LISTED UNDER OUR DISCUSSION OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. AMORTIZATION OF THESE PAYMENTS AGAINST REVENUES WAS  $383,000  AND $132,000 FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGE WRITE-DOWNS  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR BORROWERS AND TENANTS EXPERIENCE PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL PRESSURES AND DIFFICULTIES SIMILAR TO THOSE ENCOUNTERED BY OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. GOVERNMENTS AT BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS HAVE ENACTED LEGISLATION TO LOWER, OR AT LEAST SLOW, THE GROWTH IN PAYMENTS TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. FURTHERMORE, THE COST OF PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THIS SAME PERIOD. SINCE INCEPTION, A NUMBER OF OUR FACILITY OPERATORS AND MORTGAGE LOAN BORROWERS HAVE UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCY. OTHERS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SURRENDER PROPERTIES TO US IN LIEU OF FORECLOSURE OR, FOR CERTAIN PERIODS, HAVE FAILED TO MAKE TIMELY PAYMENTS ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF OUR REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES ARE RECOVERABLE AND THAT MORTGAGE AND OTHER NOTES RECEIVABLE ARE REALIZABLE AND SUPPORTED BY THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE EVENTS COULD REQUIRE US TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE CARRYING AMOUNTS.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECTING REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE DESCRIBED BELOW (  IN THOUSANDS  ).

THIS IMPACT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN RENTAL INCOME RECEIVED FROM HOLIDAY AS A RESULT OF THE LEASE AMENDMENT DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2. RENTAL INCOME WAS ALSO OFFSET BY LEASE DEFAULTS WHICH RESULTED IN TRANSITIONS TO NEW TENANTS DESCRIBED HEREIN UNDER THE HEADING  TENANT TRANSITIONING.  \u2022  THE INCREASE IN RENTAL INCOME INCLUDED A  $528,000  DECREASE IN STRAIGHT-LINE RENT ADJUSTMENTS. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRE RENTAL INCOME TO BE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE TO GIVE EFFECT TO SCHEDULED RENT ESCALATORS THAT ARE DETERMINABLE AT LEASE INCEPTION. FUTURE INCREASES IN RENTAL INCOME DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MAKE NEW INVESTMENTS WHICH MEET OUR UNDERWRITING CRITERIA.  \u2022  INTEREST INCOME FROM MORTGAGE AND OTHER NOTES INCREASED  $2,432,000  PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST INCOME RECEIVED ON LOANS TO BICKFORD SENIOR LIVING AND LIFE CARE SERVICES.  \u2022  DEPRECIATION EXPENSE INCREASED  $1,226,000  PRIMARILY DUE TO NEW REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS COMPLETED IN  2018  AND  2019.  \u2022  INTEREST EXPENSE, INCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AND ISSUANCE COSTS, INCREASED  $1,526,000  PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE SEPTEMBER 2018 CONVERSION OF $300,000,000 OF DEBT INITIALLY DRAWN ON OUR REVOLVING FACILITY INTO A FIVE-YEAR TERM LOAN AND THE IMPACT OF ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  \u2022  PAYROLL AND RELATED COMPENSATION EXPENSES DECREASED  $165,000  DUE PRIMARILY TO THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION RELATED TO ACHIEVING CERTAIN COMPANY GOALS.  \u2022  NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCREASED DUE PRIMARILY TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE BLACK-SCHOLES PRICING MODEL.  \u2022  ESCROW FUNDS RECEIVED FROM TENANTS TOTALING  $1,506,000  WERE USED TO PAY PROPERTY TAXES AND INSURANCE, WHICH IS TYPICAL OF TRIPLE NET LEASES.

LIQUIDITY  APART FROM OPERATIONS, THE MAIN SOURCE OF OUR LIQUIDITY IS OUR UNSECURED BANK CREDIT FACILITY. AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE HAD  $277,000,000  AVAILABLE TO DRAW ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  OUR BANK CREDIT FACILITY DERIVES FROM THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DATED AS OF AUGUST 3, 2017 (THE \"2017 AGREEMENT\"), AND THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT DATED AS OF SEPTEMBER 17, 2018 (THE \"2018 AGREEMENT\"). TOGETHER THESE AGREEMENTS ESTABLISH OUR UNSECURED $1,100,000,000 BANK CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH CONSISTS OF $250,000,000 AND $300,000,000 TERM LOANS AND A $550,000,000 REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE $250,000,000 TERM LOAN AND $550,000,000 REVOLVING FACILITY MATURE IN AUGUST 2022, AND THE $300,000,000 TERM LOAN IS TO MATURE IN SEPTEMBER 2023. WITH THE 2018 AGREEMENT, WE CONVERTED $300,000,000 OF DEBT INITIALLY DRAWN ON OUR REVOLVING FACILITY INTO A FIVE-YEAR TERM LOAN.  THE REVOLVING FACILITY FEE IS CURRENTLY  20  BASIS POINTS PER ANNUM, AND FLOATING INTEREST ON THE REVOLVER AND THE TERM LOANS ARE PRESENTLY SET AT 30-DAY LIBOR PLUS  115  AND A BLENDED 127 BPS, RESPECTIVELY. AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 2018  , 30-DAY LIBOR WAS  240  AND  250  BPS, RESPECTIVELY. WITHIN THE FACILITY, THE EMPLOYMENT OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS FOR A PORTION OF OUR FIXED TERM DEBT LEAVES ONLY  $213,000,000  OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK THROUGH  JUNE 2020  , WHEN OUR $80,000,000 AND $130,000,000 SWAPS EXPIRE.  OUR SWAPS AND THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO WHICH THEY RELATE ARE DESCRIBED IN THE TABLE BELOW, UNDER THE CAPTION \u201cINTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS.\u201d THE CURRENT INTEREST SPREADS AND FACILITY FEE REFLECT OUR LEVERAGE-RATIO COMPLIANCE BASED ON THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR LIBOR LOANS, MEASURING DEBT TO \u201cTOTAL ASSET VALUE,\u201d AT LEVEL 2 IN THE INTEREST RATE SCHEDULE PROVIDED BELOW IN ABRIDGED FORMAT.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST RATE SCHEDULE  LIBOR MARGIN  LEVEL  LEVERAGE RATIO  REVOLVER  $300M TERM LOAN  $250M TERM LOAN  FACILITY FEE  1  < 0.35  1.10%  1.20%  1.25%  0.15%  2  \u2265 0.35 & < 0.40  1.15%  1.25%  1.30%  0.20%  3  \u2265 0.40 & < 0.45  1.20%  1.30%  1.35%  0.20%  4  \u2265 0.45 & < 0.50  1.25%  1.40%  1.45%  0.25%  BEYOND THE APPLICABLE RATIOS DETAILED ABOVE, INCREASING LEVELS OF LEVERAGE (NOT SHOWN) WILL SUBJECT OUR DEBT TO DEFINED INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES AND FEES.  THE 2017 AGREEMENT REQUIRES THAT WE CALCULATE SPECIFIED FINANCIAL STATEMENT METRICS AND MEET OR EXCEED A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL RATIOS, WHICH ARE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY IN NATURE. THESE RATIOS ARE CALCULATED QUARTERLY AND AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  WERE WITHIN REQUIRED LIMITS.  THE CALCULATION OF OUR LEVERAGE RATIO INVOLVES INTERMEDIATE DETERMINATIONS OF OUR \u201cTOTAL INDEBTEDNESS\u201d AND OF OUR \u201cTOTAL ASSET VALUE,\u201d AS DEFINED IN THE 2017 AGREEMENT. WE ARE NEAR THE UPPER BOUNDS DELINEATED BY LEVEL 2 IN THE INTEREST RATE SCHEDULE, ABOVE.  ASIDE FROM A MORE FAVORABLE RATE, THE 2018 AGREEMENT GENERALLY CALLS FOR THE SAME COVENANTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT METRICS REQUIRED FOR COMPLIANCE WITH TERMS OF THE 2017 AGREEMENT. ALTHOUGH WE ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE UNDER THE 2017 AND 2018 AGREEMENTS TO TRANSACT IN OUR UNSECURED BANK CREDIT FACILITIES AT THE RESPECTIVE SCHEDULED RATES REPRESENTED BY LEVEL 2, THE MOVEMENT OF OUR LEVERAGE RATIO INTO LEVEL 3 OR 4 AT CURRENT LEVELS OF DEBT WOULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL ANNUAL COSTS FROM $375,000 TO $1,300,000, RESPECTIVELY, ASSUMING AN AVERAGE REVOLVER BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $200,000,000. FURTHER MOVEMENT OF OUR LEVERAGE RATIO BEYOND LEVELS CURRENTLY CONTEMPLATED BY MANAGEMENT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ESCALATING INCREASES IN INTEREST. IF, IN ADDITION TO CHANGES IN THE LEVERAGE RATIO, CERTAIN QUALITATIVE INDICATORS OF OUR RISK PROFILE WERE TO MATERIALLY CHANGE, FURTHER INTEREST-RATE ESCALATIONS MAY RESULT.  OUR AT-THE-MARKET (\u201cATM\u201d) OFFERING REPRESENTS AN ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. THROUGH THE PROGRAM IN 2019, WE ISSUED  618,654  COMMON SHARES, WITH AN AVERAGE PRICE FOR SHARES SOLD OF  $78.77  , RESULTING AFTER COMMISSIONS IN NET PROCEEDS OF  $47,999,000  . CASH FROM THESE ISSUANCES WAS INITIALLY USED TO PAY DOWN OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  AS WE CONTINUE OUR ACTIVITY IN THE ATM PROGRAM IN 2019, WE INTEND TO USE THE PROCEEDS FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND REPAYMENT OF INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY. ACQUISITIONS, IF ANY, WHOSE MAGNITUDE WOULD ENTAIL AN EQUITY MATCH UNABLE TO BE EFFICIENTLY SOURCED THROUGH THE ATM WOULD LIKELY TRIGGER A PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT AND AN UNDERWRITTEN OR OVERNIGHT OFFERING OF NHI COMMON STOCK, RATHER THAN PLACEMENT THROUGH THE ATM. OFFERINGS UNDER THE ATM PROGRAM ARE MADE PURSUANT TO A PROSPECTUS DATED FEBRUARY 22, 2017, WHICH CONSTITUTES A PART OF NHI\u2019S EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  TRADITIONALLY, DEBT FINANCING AND OPERATING AND FINANCING CASH FLOWS DERIVED FROM PROCEEDS OF LEASE AND MORTGAGE COLLECTIONS, LOAN PAYOFFS AND THE RECOVERY OF PREVIOUS WRITE-DOWNS, HAVE BEEN USED TO SATISFY OUR OPERATIONAL AND INVESTING NEEDS AND TO PROVIDE A RETURN TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ACCESS THESE SOURCES OF CAPITAL TO MEET THOSE OPERATIONAL AND INVESTING NEEDS, WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN AND CULTIVATE OUR FUNDING SOURCES AND HAVE GENERALLY FALLEN INTO THREE CATEGORIES: DEBT SERVICE, REIT OPERATING EXPENSES, AND NEW REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE ISSUANCES SINCE INCEPTION OF OUR ATM AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  .

THE USE OF FUNDS FROM OUR ATM PROGRAM EFFECTS A REBALANCING OF OUR LEVERAGE IN RESPONSE TO OUR ACQUISITIONS AND HAS KEPT OUR OPTIONS FLEXIBLE FOR FURTHER EXPANSION. WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE VARIOUS OTHER FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDING BANK TERM LOANS, CONVERTIBLE DEBT, TRADITIONAL EQUITY PLACEMENT, UNSECURED BONDS AND SENIOR NOTES, DEBT PRIVATE PLACEMENT AND SECURED GOVERNMENT AGENCY FINANCING. WE VIEW OUR ATM PROGRAM AS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO MATCH-FUND OUR SMALLER ACQUISITIONS BY EXERCISING CONTROL OVER THE TIMING AND SIZE OF TRANSACTIONS AND ACHIEVING A MORE FAVORABLE COST OF CAPITAL AS COMPARED TO LARGER FOLLOW-ON OFFERINGS.  WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUED USE OF PROCEEDS FROM THE ATM PROGRAM FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND REPAYMENT OF INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY. ACQUISITIONS, IF ANY, WHOSE MAGNITUDE WOULD ENTAIL AN EQUITY MATCH UNABLE TO BE EFFICIENTLY SOURCED THROUGH THE ATM WOULD LIKELY TRIGGER A PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT AND AN UNDERWRITTEN OR OVERNIGHT OFFERING OF NHI COMMON STOCK, RATHER THAN PLACEMENT THROUGH THE ATM.  WE EXPECT THAT BORROWINGS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, BORROWINGS ON TERM LOANS, AND OUR ATM PROGRAM WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO MAKE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS DURING 2019. HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR HISTORICALLY LOW COST OF DEBT CAPITAL WILL INCREASE IN THE MID-TERM, IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECIDES TO REVISIT THE UPWARD TRANSITIONING OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE. IN RESPONSE TO THE CHANGED INTEREST-RATE ENVIRONMENT, WE MAY FIND IT ADVISABLE WITHIN THE COMING YEAR TO ACQUIRE A PUBLIC CREDIT RATING AS A TOOL FOR MANAGING OUR INTEREST COSTS.  CONCURRENT WITH THE AMENDMENTS TO OUR CREDIT FACILITY AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SPECIFIC DEBT-COVERAGE RATIOS, COVENANTS PERTAINING TO OUR PRIVATE PLACEMENT TERM LOANS WERE GENERALLY CONFORMED WITH THOSE GOVERNING THE CREDIT FACILITY.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , OUR  $120,000,000  OF SENIOR UNSECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTES WERE CONVERTIBLE AT A RATE OF  14.52  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PER  $1,000  PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, REPRESENTING A CONVERSION PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY  $68.86  PER SHARE FOR A TOTAL OF  1,742,736  REMAINING UNDERLYING SHARES. FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , DILUTION RESULTING FROM THE CONVERSION OPTION WITHIN OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBT IS  199,492  SHARES. IF NHI\u2019S CURRENT SHARE PRICE INCREASES ABOVE THE ADJUSTED  $68.86  CONVERSION PRICE, FURTHER DILUTION WILL BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CONVERSION FEATURE. ON  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE VALUE OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT, COMPUTED AS IF THE DEBT WERE IMMEDIATELY ELIGIBLE FOR CONVERSION, EXCEEDED ITS FACE AMOUNT BY  $15,986,000.  WE MAY CONTINUE FROM TIME TO TIME TO SEEK TO RETIRE OR PURCHASE SOME OF OUR OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE NOTES THROUGH CASH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, PRIVATELY-NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS OR OTHERWISE. AS WITH OUR 2018 REPURCHASES, AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF FURTHER REPURCHASES OR EXCHANGES, IF ANY, WILL BE DEPENDENT ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER FACTORS.  WHEN WE TAKE ON NEW DEBT OR WHEN WE MODIFY OR REPLACE EXISTING DEBT, WE INCUR DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS. THESE COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION OVER THE TERM OF THE NEW DEBT INSTRUMENT AND MAY RESULT IN THE WRITE-OFF OF FEES ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT WHICH HAS BEEN REPLACED OR MODIFIED. SUSTAINING LONG-TERM DIVIDEND GROWTH WILL REQUIRE THAT WE CONSIDER ALL SOURCES OF CAPITAL MENTIONED ABOVE, WITH THE GOAL OF MAINTAINING A LOW-LEVERAGE BALANCE SHEET AS MITIGATION AGAINST POTENTIAL ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS OF OUR INDUSTRY, TENANTS AND BORROWERS.  INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS  TO MITIGATE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK, WE HAVE IN PLACE THE FOLLOWING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS IN PLACE TO HEDGE AGAINST FLOATING RATES ON OUR BANK TERM LOANS AND A PORTION OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  (  DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS  ).

THE ALTERNATIVE REFERENCE RATES COMMITTEE (\u201cARRC\u201d) HAS PROPOSED THAT THE SECURED OVERNIGHT FINANCING RATE (\u201cSOFR\u201d) IS THE RATE THAT REPRESENTS BEST PRACTICE AS THE ALTERNATIVE TO USD-LIBOR FOR USE IN DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL CONTRACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY INDEXED TO USD-LIBOR. ARRC HAS PROPOSED A PACED MARKET TRANSITION PLAN TO SOFR FROM USD-LIBOR AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON INDUSTRY WIDE AND COMPANY SPECIFIC TRANSITION PLANS AS IT RELATES TO DERIVATIVES AND CASH MARKETS EXPOSED TO USD-LIBOR. THE COMPANY HAS MATERIAL CONTRACTS THAT ARE INDEXED TO USD-LIBOR AND IS MONITORING THIS ACTIVITY AND EVALUATING THE RELATED RISKS.  WE INTEND TO COMPLY WITH REIT DIVIDEND REQUIREMENTS THAT WE DISTRIBUTE AT LEAST 90% OF OUR ANNUAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR THE YEAR ENDING  DECEMBER 31, 2019  AND THEREAFTER. DIVIDENDS DECLARED FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR ARE PAID BY THE END OF THE FOLLOWING JANUARY AND ARE, WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS, TREATED FOR TAX PURPOSES AS HAVING BEEN PAID IN THE FISCAL YEAR JUST ENDED AS PROVIDED IN IRS CODE SEC. 857(B)(8). WE DECLARE SPECIAL DIVIDENDS WHEN WE COMPUTE OUR REIT TAXABLE INCOME IN AN AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDS OUR REGULAR DIVIDENDS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO OUTSTANDING GUARANTEES. AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, OUR LEASES, MORTGAGES AND OTHER NOTES RECEIVABLE WITH CERTAIN ENTITIES REPRESENT VARIABLE INTERESTS IN THOSE ENTERPRISES. HOWEVER, BECAUSE WE DO NOT CONTROL THESE ENTITIES, NOR DO WE HAVE ANY ROLE IN THEIR DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT, WE ARE NOT THEIR PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. EXCEPT AS DISCUSSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, UNDER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, WE HAVE NO FURTHER MATERIAL OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM OUR TRANSACTIONS WITH THESE ENTITIES, AND WE BELIEVE OUR MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , DUE TO THIS INVOLVEMENT WOULD BE LIMITED TO OUR CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND THE AMOUNT OF OUR CURRENT INVESTMENTS WITH THEM, AS DETAILED FURTHER IN NOTES 1, 2, 3 AND 6 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE FURNISHED NO DIRECT SUPPORT TO ANY OF THESE ENTITIES.  IN MARCH 2014 WE ISSUED $200,000,000 OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES, THE CONVERSION FEATURE BEING INTENDED TO BROADEN THE COMPANY\u2019S CREDIT PROFILE AND AS A MEANS TO OBTAIN A MORE FAVORABLE COUPON RATE. FOR THIS FEATURE WE CALCULATE THE DILUTIVE EFFECT USING MARKET PRICES PREVAILING OVER THE REPORTING PERIOD. BECAUSE THE DILUTION CALCULATION IS MARKET-DRIVEN, AND PER SHARE GUIDANCE WE PROVIDE IS BASED ON DILUTED AMOUNTS, THE THEORETICAL EFFECTS OF THE CONVERSION FEATURE RESULT IN PER SHARE UNPREDICTABILITY.  ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ALSO GIVE WIDELY RANGING RESULTS DEPENDING ON MARKET PRICE VARIABILITY. THE NOTES WILL BE FREELY CONVERTIBLE IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF THEIR CONTRACTUAL LIFE, BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2020; HOWEVER, GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRE US TO PERIODICALLY REPORT THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE NOTES\u2019 CONVERTIBLE VALUE EXCEEDS THEIR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CURRENT AVAILABILITY OF THE CONVERSION FEATURE. FURTHER, THE MECHANICS OF THE CALCULATION REQUIRE THE USE OF AN END-OF-PERIOD STOCK PRICE, SO THAT USING THAT AMOUNT FOR THE REMAINING NOTES OUTSTANDING OF $120,000,000 AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , DELIVERS AN EXCESS OF  $15,986,000  , WHEREAS THE USE OF ANOTHER PRICE POINT WOULD GIVE A DIFFERENT RESULT.  THE CONVERSION FEATURE IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO THE NOTEHOLDERS ENTERING THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF THE NOTES\u2019 TERM BUT MAY ALSO BECOME ACTIONABLE IF THE MARKET PRICE OF NHI\u2019S COMMON STOCK SHOULD, FOR 20 OF 30 CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS WITHIN A CALENDAR QUARTER, SUSTAIN A LEVEL IN EXCESS OF 130% OF THE ADJUSTED CONVERSION PRICE, OR $90.44 PER SHARE, DOWN FROM $93.55 PER SHARE, INITIALLY. THE NOTES ARE \u201cOPTIONAL NET-SHARE SETTLEMENT\u201d INSTRUMENTS, MEANING THAT NHI HAS THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO SETTLE THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE INDEBTEDNESS IN CASH, WITH POSSIBLE DILUTIVE SHARE ISSUANCES FOR ANY EXCESS, AT NHI\u2019S OPTION. SETTLEMENT OF THE NOTES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO ALLOCATE THE CONSIDERATION WE ULTIMATELY PAY BETWEEN THE DEBT COMPONENT AND THE EQUITY CONVERSION FEATURE AS THOUGH THEY WERE SEPARATE INSTRUMENTS. THE ALLOCATION IS EFFECTED BY VALUING THE DEBT COMPONENT FIRST, WITH ANY REMAINDER ALLOCATED TO THE CONVERSION FEATURE. AMOUNTS EXPENDED TO SETTLE THE NOTES WILL BE RECOGNIZED FIRST AS A SETTLEMENT OF THE NOTES AT PAR AND THEN WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME TO THE EXTENT THE PORTION ALLOCATED TO THE DEBT INSTRUMENT DIFFERS FROM PAR VALUE. THE REMAINDER OF THE ALLOCATION, IF ANY, WILL BE TREATED AS SETTLEMENT OF EQUITY AND ADJUSTED THROUGH OUR PAID IN CAPITAL ACCOUNT.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF INCENTIVE LOAN DRAWS OF $8,000,000 AVAILABLE TO BICKFORD RELATED TO BORROWINGS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS PROPERTIES IN ILLINOIS, MICHIGAN, AND VIRGINIA, SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  LITIGATION  OUR FACILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO CLAIMS AND SUITS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. OUR LESSEES AND BORROWERS HAVE INDEMNIFIED, AND ARE OBLIGATED TO CONTINUE TO INDEMNIFY US, AGAINST ALL LIABILITIES ARISING FROM THE OPERATION OF THE FACILITIES, AND ARE FURTHER OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY US AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL OR TITLE PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE REAL ESTATE UNDERLYING SUCH FACILITIES. WHILE THERE MAY BE LAWSUITS PENDING AGAINST CERTAIN OF THE OWNERS AND/OR LESSEES OF THE FACILITIES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESOLUTION OF ALL SUCH PENDING PROCEEDINGS WILL HAVE NO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.  FFO, AFFO & FAD  THESE SUPPLEMENTAL OPERATING PERFORMANCE MEASURES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER REITS. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cFFO\u201d), NORMALIZED FFO, NORMALIZED ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cAFFO\u201d) AND NORMALIZED FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION (\u201cFAD\u201d) MAY NOT PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL MEASURE OF OUR PERFORMANCE AS COMPARED TO THAT OF OTHER REITS. SINCE OTHER REITS MAY NOT USE OUR DEFINITION OF THESE OPERATING PERFORMANCE MEASURES, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN COMPARING OUR FFO, NORMALIZED FFO, NORMALIZED AFFO AND NORMALIZED FAD TO THAT OF OTHER REITS. THESE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES DO NOT REPRESENT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) (THESE MEASURES DO NOT INCLUDE CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES) AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET EARNINGS AS AN INDICATION OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE, OR TO NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS DETERMINED BY GAAP AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY, AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF CASH AVAILABLE TO FUND CASH NEEDS.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS - FFO  OUR FFO PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  WAS UNCHANGED OVER THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF  1,185,152  COMMON SHARES ISSUED SINCE JUNE 30, 2018. FFO, AS DEFINED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\u201cNAREIT\u201d) AND APPLIED BY US, IS NET INCOME (COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP), EXCLUDING GAINS (OR LOSSES) FROM SALES OF REAL ESTATE PROPERTY, PLUS REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND AFTER ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES, IF ANY. THE COMPANY\u2019S COMPUTATION OF FFO MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO FFO REPORTED BY OTHER REITS THAT DO NOT DEFINE THE TERM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CURRENT NAREIT DEFINITION OR HAVE A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF THE CURRENT NAREIT DEFINITION FROM THAT OF THE COMPANY; THEREFORE, CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN COMPARING OUR COMPANY\u2019S FFO TO THAT OF OTHER REITS. DILUTED FFO ASSUMES THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES.  OUR NORMALIZED FFO PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  DECREASED  $0.05  (  1.8%  ) OVER THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF  1,185,152  COMMON SHARES ISSUED SINCE JUNE 30, 2018. NORMALIZED FFO EXCLUDES FROM FFO CERTAIN ITEMS WHICH, DUE TO THEIR INFREQUENT OR UNPREDICTABLE NATURE, MAY CREATE SOME DIFFICULTY IN COMPARING FFO FOR THE CURRENT PERIOD TO SIMILAR PRIOR PERIODS, AND MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, IMPAIRMENT OF NON-REAL ESTATE ASSETS, GAINS AND LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACQUISITION AND DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND RECOVERIES OF PREVIOUS WRITE-DOWNS.  FFO AND NORMALIZED FFO ARE IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR A REIT. BECAUSE THE HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING CONVENTION USED FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS REQUIRES DEPRECIATION (EXCEPT ON LAND), SUCH ACCOUNTING PRESENTATION IMPLIES THAT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS DIMINISHES PREDICTABLY OVER TIME. SINCE REAL ESTATE VALUES INSTEAD HAVE HISTORICALLY RISEN AND FALLEN WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, PRESENTATIONS OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR A REIT THAT USES HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING FOR DEPRECIATION COULD BE LESS INFORMATIVE, AND SHOULD BE SUPPLEMENTED WITH A MEASURE SUCH AS FFO. THE TERM FFO WAS DESIGNED BY THE REIT INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.  ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS - AFFO  OUR NORMALIZED AFFO PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  WAS UNCHANGED OVER THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF  1,185,152  COMMON SHARES ISSUED SINCE JUNE 30, 2018. IN ADDITION TO THE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION OF NORMALIZED FFO, NORMALIZED AFFO EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF ANY STRAIGHT-LINE RENT REVENUE, AMORTIZATION OF THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT ON OUR CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES AND AMORTIZATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS.  NORMALIZED AFFO IS AN IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR A REIT. GAAP REQUIRES A LESSOR TO RECOGNIZE CONTRACTUAL LEASE PAYMENTS INTO INCOME ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE LEASE. THIS STRAIGHT-LINE ADJUSTMENT HAS THE EFFECT OF REPORTING LEASE INCOME THAT IS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE OR LESS THAN THE CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS RECEIVED PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE LEASE AGREEMENT. GAAP ALSO REQUIRES THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT OF OUR CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES AND DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS TO BE AMORTIZED AS NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS TO EARNINGS. NORMALIZED AFFO IS USEFUL TO OUR INVESTORS AS IT REFLECTS THE GROWTH INHERENT IN THE CONTRACTUAL LEASE PAYMENTS OF OUR REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO.  FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION - FAD  OUR NORMALIZED FAD FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  INCREASED  $4,570,000  (  4.3%  ) OVER THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPACT OF NEW INVESTMENTS COMPLETED SINCE JUNE 30, 2018. IN ADDITION TO THE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION OF NORMALIZED AFFO, NORMALIZED FAD EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH STOCK BASED COMPENSATION. NORMALIZED FAD IS AN IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY FOR A REIT AS A USEFUL INDICATOR OF THE ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS.  49  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE RECONCILES NET INCOME, THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP METRIC, TO FFO, NORMALIZED FFO, NORMALIZED AFFO AND NORMALIZED FAD AND IS PRESENTED FOR BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  .

THIS REVENUE IS EARNED WHEN A CUSTOMER\u2019S RECEIVABLE BALANCE BECOMES DELINQUENT AND IS CALCULATED USING THE GREATER OF A MINIMUM CHARGE OR A STATED LATE FEE RATE MULTIPLIED BY THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE THAT IS SUBJECT TO A LATE FEE CHARGE. CHANGES IN THE ABSOLUTE AMOUNT OF SUCH OUTSTANDING BALANCES CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO (I) CHANGES IN FUEL PRICES; (II) CUSTOMER SPECIFIC TRANSACTION VOLUME; AND (III) CUSTOMER SPECIFIC DELINQUENCIES. LATE FEE REVENUE CAN ALSO BE IMPACTED BY (I) CHANGES IN LATE FEE RATES AND (II) INCREASES OR DECREASES IN CUSTOMER OVERDUE BALANCES. LATE FEE RATES ARE DETERMINED AND SET BASED PRIMARILY ON THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, COUPLED WITH A STRATEGIC VIEW OF STANDARD RATES WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY. PERIODICALLY, WE ASSESS THE MARKET RATES ASSOCIATED WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE LATE FEE RATES. WE CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS THE COMPANY\u2019S OVERALL FINANCIAL MODEL AND STRATEGIC PLAN, THE COST TO OUR BUSINESS FROM CUSTOMERS FAILING TO PAY TIMELY AND THE IMPACT SUCH LATE PAYMENTS HAVE ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

FINANCE FEE REVENUE  DECREASED  $6.1 MILLION  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AND  $11.0 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACCOUNTING IMPACT OF OUR WEX LATIN AMERICA SECURITIZATION ARRANGEMENT, AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THE OTHER REVENUE DISCUSSION BELOW.  CONCESSIONS TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES MAY BE GRANTED AND ARE LIMITED TO EXTENDING THE TIME TO PAY, PLACING A CUSTOMER ON A PAYMENT PLAN OR GRANTING WAIVERS OF LATE FEES. AS OF THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  , THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CONCESSIONS GRANTED TO CUSTOMERS.  OTHER REVENUE  INCREASED  $5.4 MILLION  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AND  $7.9 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO REALIZED GAINS ON THE SALE OF WEX LATIN AMERICA CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES UNDER A SECURITIZATION ARRANGEMENT. PRIOR TO AN AMENDMENT OF THIS SECURITIZATION ARRANGEMENT DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, THE REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES WAS PRIMARILY INCLUDED IN FINANCE FEE REVENUE.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OPERATING EXPENSES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE COMPARES LINE ITEMS WITHIN OPERATING INCOME FOR HEALTH AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT SOLUTIONS.

SERVICE FEES  INCREASED  $1.0 MILLION  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AND  $3.2 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST HALF OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO COSTS INCURRED ON HIGHER ASSET BALANCES AND AN INCREASE IN PARTICIPANTS UTILIZING OUR SAAS HEALTHCARE OFFERINGS.  PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS NOT MATERIAL TO HEALTH AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT SOLUTIONS\u2019 OPERATIONS FOR BOTH THE SECOND QUARTERS AND FIRST HALVES OF 2019 AND  2018.

AS SUCH, OUR ASSOCIATED COST OF FUNDING IS NOW PART OF THE GAIN ON SALE OF THE RECEIVABLES AND IS RECORDED WITHIN OTHER REVENUE.

OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  INCREASED  $4.2 MILLION  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AND  $5.2 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST HALF OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE ACQUISITION OF DISCOVERY BENEFITS.  SALES AND MARKETING  INCREASED  $3.1 MILLION  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF 2019 AND  $4.4 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST HALF OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE ACQUISITION OF DISCOVERY BENEFITS AND AN INCREASE IN WEX HEALTH PERSONNEL-RELATED COSTS.

OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE EXPOSURE IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR CASH, RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE BALANCES, INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY INCURRED NET FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS OF  $6.7 MILLION  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF 2019 AND  $2.8 MILLION  IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2019, DUE PRIMARILY TO FAVORABILITY ON INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS RESULTING FROM A STRENGTHENING OF THE EURO AGAINST THE BRITISH POUND. DURING THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018, THE COMPANY INCURRED FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE WEAKENING OF THREE OF THE MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN WHICH WE TRANSACT, THE EURO, BRITISH POUND AND BRAZILIAN REAL.  NET UNREALIZED GAIN ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  DECREASED  $24.2 MILLION  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AND  $49.6 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE LIBOR FORWARD YIELD CURVE. DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, THE COMPANY BENEFITED FROM INCREASES IN THE YIELD CURVE.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  28.0 PERCENT  AND  27.5 PERCENT  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND FIRST HALF OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  24.2 PERCENT  AND  24.8 PERCENT  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN OUR TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE JURISDICTIONAL EARNINGS MIX, INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND LOWER TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  NET INCOME FROM NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS RELATES TO OUR NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN WEX EUROPE SERVICES AND THE U.S. HEALTH BUSINESS. SUCH AMOUNTS WERE NOT MATERIAL TO COMPANY OPERATIONS FOR BOTH THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND 2018.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, THE ACCRETION OF THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE US HEALTH BUSINESS WAS  $17.7 MILLION  RESULTING FROM AN ADJUSTMENT TO REDEMPTION VALUE AS CALCULATED PER THE ACQUISITION AGREEMENT.  NON\u2013GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES  THE COMPANY\u2019S NON-GAAP ADJUSTED NET INCOME EXCLUDES UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, NET FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT GAINS AND LOSSES, ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION, OTHER ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE RELATED ITEMS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, OTHER COSTS, DEBT RESTRUCTURING AND DEBT ISSUANCE COST AMORTIZATION, SIMILAR ADJUSTMENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS AND CERTAIN TAX RELATED ITEMS.  ALTHOUGH ADJUSTED NET INCOME IS NOT CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THIS NON-GAAP MEASURE IS INTEGRAL TO THE COMPANY\u2019S REPORTING AND PLANNING PROCESSES AND THE CODM OF THE COMPANY USES SEGMENT ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES AMONG OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THIS MEASURE INTEGRAL BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES THE ABOVE-SPECIFIED ITEMS THAT THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT EXCLUDES IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE. SPECIFICALLY, IN ADDITION TO EVALUATING THE COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE ON A GAAP BASIS, MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE ON A BASIS THAT EXCLUDES THE ABOVE ITEMS BECAUSE.  \u2022  EXCLUSION OF THE NON-CASH, MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES, HELPS MANAGEMENT IDENTIFY AND ASSESS TRENDS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S UNDERLYING BUSINESS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE OBSCURED DUE TO QUARTERLY NON-CASH EARNINGS FLUCTUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE NON-CASH, MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST ACCURATELY, MAKING COMPARISONS ACROSS HISTORICAL AND FUTURE QUARTERS DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE.  \u2022  NET FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES PRIMARILY RESULT FROM THE REMEASUREMENT TO FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF CASH, RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE BALANCES, CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY NOTES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND ANY GAIN OR LOSS ON FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES RELATING TO THESE ITEMS. THE EXCLUSION OF THESE ITEMS HELPS MANAGEMENT COMPARE CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS BETWEEN PERIODS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE OBSCURED DUE TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY CONSIDERS CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN FINANCING COSTS, INVESTMENT BANKING FEES, WARRANTY AND INDEMNITY INSURANCE, CERTAIN INTEGRATION-RELATED EXPENSES AND AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES, AS WELL AS GAINS AND LOSSES FROM DIVESTITURES TO BE UNPREDICTABLE, DEPENDENT ON FACTORS THAT MAY BE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL AND UNRELATED TO THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF THE ACQUIRED OR DIVESTED BUSINESS OR THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF AN ACQUISITION, WHICH OFTEN DRIVES THE MAGNITUDE OF ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF SUCH FUTURE COSTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT EXCLUDING ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS AND GAINS OR LOSSES OF DIVESTITURES FACILITATES THE COMPARISON OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS TO THE COMPANY\u2019S HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS AND TO OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY.  \u2022  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER FORMS OF COMPENSATION, AS IT IS A NON-CASH EXPENSE. FOR EXAMPLE, A CASH SALARY GENERALLY HAS A FIXED AND UNVARYING CASH COST. IN CONTRAST, THE EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH AN EQUITY-BASED AWARD IS GENERALLY UNRELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF CASH ULTIMATELY RECEIVED BY THE EMPLOYEE, AND THE COST TO THE COMPANY IS BASED ON A STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION VALUATION METHODOLOGY AND UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME.  \u2022  OTHER COSTS INCLUDES OTHER IMMATERIAL COSTS THAT THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED AND ARE NON-OPERATIONAL AND NON-RECURRING. WE EXCLUDE THESE ITEMS WHEN EVALUATING OUR CONTINUING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AS SUCH ITEMS ARE NOT CONSISTENTLY OCCURRING AND DO NOT REFLECT EXPECTED FUTURE OPERATING EXPENSE, NOR DO THEY PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE FUNDAMENTALS OF CURRENT OR PAST OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS. THIS ALSO INCLUDES COSTS RELATED TO CERTAIN IDENTIFIED INITIATIVES TO FURTHER STREAMLINE THE BUSINESS, IMPROVE THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFICIENCY, CREATE SYNERGIES AND GLOBALIZE THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS AND REMEDIATE THE PRIOR YEAR MATERIAL WEAKNESSES.  \u2022  DEBT RESTRUCTURING AND DEBT ISSUANCE COST AMORTIZATION ARE UNRELATED TO THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY. DEBT RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE NOT CONSISTENTLY OCCURRING AND DO NOT REFLECT EXPECTED FUTURE OPERATING EXPENSE, NOR DO THEY PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE FUNDAMENTALS OF CURRENT OR PAST OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, SINCE DEBT ISSUANCE COST AMORTIZATION IS DEPENDENT UPON THE FINANCING METHOD WHICH CAN VARY WIDELY COMPANY TO COMPANY, WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING THESE COSTS HELPS TO FACILITATE COMPARISON TO HISTORICAL RESULTS AS WELL AS TO OTHER COMPANIES WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY.  \u2022  THE ADJUSTMENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS, INCLUDING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE REDEMPTION VALUE OF A NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST, HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ONGOING OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS.  \u2022  THE TAX RELATED ITEMS ARE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMPANY\u2019S GAAP TAX PROVISION AND A PRO FORMA TAX PROVISION BASED UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S ADJUSTED NET INCOME BEFORE TAXES AS WELL AS THE IMPACT FROM CERTAIN DISCRETE TAX ITEMS. THE METHODOLOGY UTILIZED FOR CALCULATING THE COMPANY\u2019S ADJUSTED NET INCOME TAX PROVISION IS THE SAME METHODOLOGY UTILIZED IN CALCULATING THE COMPANY\u2019S GAAP TAX PROVISION.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR THE SAME REASONS, WEX BELIEVES THAT ADJUSTED NET INCOME MAY ALSO BE USEFUL TO INVESTORS AS ONE MEANS OF EVALUATING THE COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, BECAUSE ADJUSTED NET INCOME IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE, IT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO, NET INCOME, OPERATING INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. IN ADDITION, ADJUSTED NET INCOME AS USED BY WEX MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES EMPLOYED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

CONSEQUENTLY, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS ARE IMPACTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY CHANGES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BALANCES, WHICH DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR CAPITAL RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  INCREASED  $146.1 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE IN EXCESS OF THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PRIMARILY DUE TO A FACTORING ARRANGEMENT IN WHICH THE COMPANY RETAINS THE MERCHANT PAYABLE AND SELLS THE RELATED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS IN PLACE DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, BUT NOT IN PLACE DURING IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  INCREASED  $587.5 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, RESULTING FROM  $571.6 MILLION  OF PAYMENTS MADE FOR ACQUISITIONS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  INCREASED  $960.5 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER OVERALL BORROWINGS IN CONNECTION WITH FUNDING THE ACQUISITIONS AND RAISING DEPOSITS IN ORDER TO FUND ASSET GROWTH.  2016 CREDIT AGREEMENT  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE 2016 CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED, PROVIDED FOR A SECURED TRANCHE A TERM LOAN IN AN ORIGINAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $480.0 MILLION  , A SECURED TRANCHE B TERM LOAN IN AN ORIGINAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $1,335.0 MILLION  AND A  $720.0 MILLION  SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WITH A  $250.0 MILLION  SUBLIMIT FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT AND  $20.0 MILLION  SUBLIMIT FOR SWINGLINE LOANS. UNDER THE 2016 CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS GRANTED A SECURITY INTEREST IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, SUBJECT TO EXCEPTIONS INCLUDING THE ASSETS OF WEX BANK AND CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.  ON JANUARY 18, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FIFTH AMENDMENT TO THE 2016 CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH PROVIDED ADDITIONAL TRANCHE A TERM LOANS IN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $300.0 MILLION  . IN ADDITION, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, THE FIFTH AMENDMENT PROVIDED DELAYED DRAW COMMITMENTS FOR AN INCREMENTAL  $275.0 MILLION  TRANCHE A TERM LOAN AND AN INCREMENTAL  $25.0 MILLION  OF REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENTS (SUBJECT TO CONVERSION OF THE DELAYED DRAW INCREMENTAL TRANCHE A TERM LOAN COMMITMENTS AND INCREMENTAL REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENTS TO COMMITMENTS OF THE OTHER TYPE). ON MARCH 5, 2019, THE COMPANY DREW DOWN THIS COMMITMENT IN ORDER TO FUND THE ACQUISITION OF DISCOVERY BENEFITS, CONSISTING OF  $250.0 MILLION  OF TRANCHE A  TERM LOANS AND AN INCREMENTAL  $50.0 MILLION  OF REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENTS.  ON MAY 17, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SIXTH AMENDMENT TO THE 2016 CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH PROVIDED ADDITIONAL TRANCHE B TERM LOANS IN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $150.0 MILLION  AND EXTENDED THE MATURITY DATE OF TRANCHE B TERM LOANS BY THREE YEARS TO MAY 2026.  AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TRANCHE A TERM LOANS OF THE 2016 CREDIT AGREEMENT MATURE IN JULY 2023. PRIOR TO MATURITY, AMOUNTS BORROWED UNDER THE TRANCHE A AND TRANCHE B TERM LOAN FACILITIES WILL BE REDUCED BY MANDATORY QUARTERLY PAYMENTS OF  $12.5 MILLION  AND  $3.7 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.

WEX EUROPE SERVICES ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FACTORING  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017, WEX EUROPE SERVICES ENTERED INTO A FACTORING ARRANGEMENT WITH AN UNRELATED THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (THE \u201cPURCHASING BANK\u201d) TO SELL CERTAIN OF ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE THE COLLECTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH AND REDUCE THE INTERNAL COSTS, THEREBY IMPROVING LIQUIDITY. UNDER THIS ARRANGEMENT, THE PURCHASING BANK ESTABLISHES A CREDIT LIMIT FOR EACH CUSTOMER ACCOUNT. THE FACTORED RECEIVABLES ARE WITHOUT RECOURSE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE CUSTOMER BALANCES ARE MAINTAINED AT OR BELOW THE ESTABLISHED CREDIT LIMIT. THE COMPANY OBTAINED A TRUE SALE OPINION FROM AN INDEPENDENT ATTORNEY, WHICH STATES THAT THE FACTORING AGREEMENT CREATES A SALE OF RECEIVABLES UNDER LOCAL LAW FOR AMOUNTS TRANSFERRED BOTH BELOW AND ABOVE THE ESTABLISHED CREDIT LIMITS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT IN THE FACTORED RECEIVABLES. AS A RESULT, THE PURCHASING BANK IS DEEMED THE PURCHASER OF THESE RECEIVABLES AND IS ENTITLED TO ENFORCE PAYMENT OF THESE AMOUNTS FROM THE DEBTOR. AVAILABLE CAPACITY IS DEPENDENT ON THE LEVEL OF OUR TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ELIGIBLE TO BE SOLD AND THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION\u2019S WILLINGNESS TO PURCHASE SUCH RECEIVABLES. AS SUCH, THIS FACTORING ARRANGEMENT CAN BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED AT ANY TIME DUE TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND CHANGES IN THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY.

THE COMPANY OBTAINED A TRUE-SALE OPINION FROM AN INDEPENDENT ATTORNEY, WHICH STATES THAT THE FACTORING AGREEMENT  PROVIDES LEGAL ISOLATION UPON WEX BANK BANKRUPTCY OR RECEIVERSHIP UNDER LOCAL LAW. AS SUCH, TRANSFERS UNDER THIS ARRANGEMENT ARE TREATED AS A SALE. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE ARE REPORTED NET OF NEGOTIATED DISCOUNT RATE AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION IN TRADE RECEIVABLES BECAUSE THE AGREEMENTS TRANSFER EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THE RECEIVABLES TO THE BUYER.  WEX LATIN AMERICA SECURITIZATION OF RECEIVABLES  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WEX LATIN AMERICA ENTERED INTO A SECURITIZED DEBT AGREEMENT TO TRANSFER CERTAIN UNSECURED RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SALARY PAYMENT CARD PRODUCT TO AN INVESTMENT FUND MANAGED BY AN UNRELATED THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND THROUGH JUNE 30, 2018, THIS SECURITIZATION ARRANGEMENT DID NOT MEET THE DERECOGNITION CONDITIONS DUE TO CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT WITH THE TRANSFERRED ASSETS AND ACCORDINGLY WEX LATIN AMERICA REPORTED THE TRANSFERRED RECEIVABLES AND SECURITIZED DEBT ON OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, THE SECURITIZATION AGREEMENTS WERE AMENDED, RESULTING IN THE COMPANY GIVING UP EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THE TRANSFERRED RECEIVABLES TO THE BUYER. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A TRUE-SALE OPINION FROM AN INDEPENDENT ATTORNEY STATING THAT THE AMENDED AGREEMENTS PROVIDE LEGAL ISOLATION UPON WEX LATIN AMERICA BANKRUPTCY OR RECEIVERSHIP UNDER LOCAL LAW. AS SUCH, THE SECURITIZATION ARRANGEMENT MEETS THE DERECOGNITION CONDITIONS AND TRANSFERS UNDER THIS ARRANGEMENT ARE TREATED AS A SALE AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION IN TRADE RECEIVABLES.

OFF\u2013BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  EVEN THOUGH OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT RECORDED AS LIABILITIES UNDER GAAP, SUCH ARRANGEMENTS MAY POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS SERVE A VARIETY OF BUSINESS PURPOSES, HOWEVER THE COMPANY IS NOT DEPENDENT ON THEM TO MAINTAIN ITS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO CAUSE THE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.

DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $3,763,148 AND USED $2,808,372  OF CASH IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE LOSSES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE COMPANY\u2019S  LIQUIDITY NEEDS WILL BE LARGELY DETERMINED BY THE BUDGETED OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES INCURRED IN REGARDS TO THE PROGRESSION OF  ITS PRODUCT CANDIDATES. THE COMPANY\u2019S PLANS TO MEET ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS PRIMARILY INCLUDE ITS ABILITY TO CONTROL THE TIMING  AND SPENDING ON ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND RAISING ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH POTENTIAL PARTNERSHIP AND/OR FINANCINGS.  MANAGEMENT IS EVALUATING ALL OPTIONS TO RAISE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO FUND THE COMPANY\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO  NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO THE RECOVERABILITY AND CLASSIFICATION OF RECORDED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT BE  NECESSARY SHOULD THE COMPANY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  7  AS  OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $6,986,289 AS COMPARED TO $8,983,717 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, REPRESENTING  A DECREASE OF $1,997,428 OR 22%. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD WORKING CAPITAL OF $3,311,412 AS COMPARED TO WORKING CAPITAL  OF $6,131,178 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, REPRESENTING A DECREASE OF $2,819,766 OR 46%. THE DECREASE IN CASH AND WORKING CAPITAL  WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO EXPENDITURES INCURRED IN THE EXPANSION OF THE PIVOTAL PHASE 3 TRIAL OF SGX942 IN ADDITION TO THE ONGOING  EXPENDITURES INCURRED IN THE PIVOTAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL OF SGX301.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S  BUSINESS STRATEGY CAN BE OUTLINED AS FOLLOWS.  \u25cf  FOLLOWING POSITIVE INTERIM ANALYSIS, COMPLETE ENROLLMENT AND REPORT FINAL RESULTS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S PIVOTAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL OF SGX301 FOR THE TREATMENT OF CTCL;  \u25cf  CONTINUE ENROLLMENT OF THE PIVOTAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL OF SGX942 FOR THE TREATMENT OF ORAL MUCOSITIS IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER;  \u25cf  CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT OF RIVAX  \u00ae  IN COMBINATION WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S THERMOVAX  \u00ae  TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP A NEW HEAT STABLE VACCINE IN BIODEFENSE WITH NIAID FUNDING SUPPORT;  \u25cf  CONTINUE TO APPLY FOR AND SECURE ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR EACH OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SPECIALIZED BIOTHERAPEUTICS AND PUBLIC HEALTH SOLUTIONS PROGRAMS THROUGH GRANTS, CONTRACTS AND/OR PROCUREMENTS;  \u25cf  PURSUE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S PIPELINE PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS EXPLORE MERGER/ACQUISITION STRATEGIES; AND  \u25cf  ACQUIRE OR IN-LICENSE NEW CLINICAL-STAGE COMPOUNDS FOR DEVELOPMENT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S PLANS WITH RESPECT  TO ITS LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING.  \u25cf  THE COMPANY HAS UP TO $12.4 MILLION IN ACTIVE GOVERNMENT CONTRACT AND GRANT FUNDING STILL AVAILABLE AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, TO SUPPORT ITS ASSOCIATED RESEARCH PROGRAMS THROUGH 2019 AND BEYOND, PROVIDED THE FEDERAL AGENCIES EXERCISE ALL OPTIONS AND DO NOT ELECT TO TERMINATE THE CONTRACTS OR GRANTS FOR CONVENIENCE. THE COMPANY PLANS TO SUBMIT ADDITIONAL CONTRACT AND GRANT APPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER SUPPORT OF ITS PROGRAMS WITH VARIOUS FUNDING AGENCIES;  \u25cf  THE COMPANY HAS CONTINUED TO USE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS TO PROVIDE A PORTION OF THE COMPENSATION DUE TO VENDORS AND COLLABORATION PARTNERS AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO DO SO FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE;  \u25cf  THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE NET OPERATING LOSS (\u201cNOL\u201d) SALES IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY PURSUANT TO ITS TECHNOLOGY BUSINESS TAX CERTIFICATE TRANSFER PROGRAM IF AVAILABLE;  \u25cf  THE COMPANY PLANS TO PURSUE POTENTIAL PARTNERSHIPS FOR PIPELINE PROGRAMS.

HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY CAN CONSUMMATE SUCH A TRANSACTION, OR CONSUMMATE A TRANSACTION AT FAVORABLE PRICING.  8  NOTE  2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  PRINCIPLES  OF CONSOLIDATION  THE  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE SOLIGENIX, INC., AND ITS WHOLLY AND MAJORITY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY  ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED AS A RESULT OF CONSOLIDATION.  OPERATING  SEGMENTS  OPERATING  SEGMENTS ARE DEFINED AS COMPONENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE ABOUT WHICH SEPARATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE THAT IS EVALUATED  ON A REGULAR BASIS BY THE CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER, OR DECISION MAKING GROUP, IN DECIDING HOW TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES TO AN  INDIVIDUAL SEGMENT AND IN ASSESSING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SEGMENT. THE COMPANY DIVIDES ITS OPERATIONS INTO TWO OPERATING SEGMENTS.  SPECIALIZED BIOTHERAPEUTICS AND PUBLIC HEALTH SOLUTIONS.  CASH  AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  THE  COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS WHEN PURCHASED TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS.  CONTRACTS  AND GRANTS RECEIVABLE  CONTRACTS  AND GRANTS RECEIVABLE CONSIST OF AMOUNTS DUE FROM VARIOUS GRANTS FROM THE NIH AND CONTRACTS FROM NIAID, AN INSTITUTE OF NIH, FOR  COSTS INCURRED PRIOR TO THE PERIOD END UNDER REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS. THE AMOUNTS WERE BILLED TO THE RESPECTIVE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES  IN THE MONTH SUBSEQUENT TO PERIOD END AND COLLECTED SHORTLY THEREAFTER. ACCORDINGLY, NO ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL AMOUNTS HAS BEEN  ESTABLISHED. IF AMOUNTS BECOME UNCOLLECTIBLE, THEY ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS.  INTANGIBLE  ASSETS  ONE  OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS THAT THE COMPANY MAKES IS WHETHER TO CAPITALIZE OR EXPENSE PATENT AND LICENSE COSTS.  THE COMPANY MAKES THIS JUDGMENT BASED ON WHETHER THE TECHNOLOGY HAS ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES, AS DEFINED IN FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) 730,  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  BASED ON THIS CONSIDERATION, THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES PAYMENTS MADE TO LEGAL FIRMS THAT ARE ENGAGED IN FILING AND PROTECTING RIGHTS  TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND RIGHTS FOR ITS CURRENT PRODUCTS IN BOTH THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES  THAT PATENT RIGHTS ARE ONE OF ITS MOST VALUABLE ASSETS. PATENTS AND PATENT APPLICATIONS ARE A KEY COMPONENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,  ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLY STAGE OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AS THEIR PURCHASE AND MAINTENANCE GIVES THE COMPANY ACCESS TO KEY PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS FROM SOLIGENIX\u2019S ACADEMIC AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS. THESE RIGHTS CAN ALSO BE SOLD OR SUB-LICENSED AS PART  OF ITS STRATEGY TO PARTNER ITS PRODUCTS AT EACH STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT AS THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS HAVE ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE. THE  LEGAL COSTS INCURRED FOR THESE PATENTS CONSIST OF WORK ASSOCIATED WITH FILING NEW PATENTS DESIGNED TO PROTECT, PRESERVE AND MAINTAIN  THE COMPANY\u2019S RIGHTS, AND PERHAPS EXTEND THE LIVES OF THE PATENTS. THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES SUCH COSTS AND AMORTIZES INTANGIBLES  ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE \u2013 GENERALLY A PERIOD OF 11 TO 16 YEARS.  THE  COMPANY DID NOT CAPITALIZE ANY PATENT RELATED COSTS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018.  THESE  INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY  NOT BE RECOVERABLE OR IF THE UNDERLYING PROGRAM IS NO LONGER BEING PURSUED. IF THE SUM OF THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS  IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS, A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR  VALUE AND CARRYING VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS. NO SUCH WRITE DOWNS HAVE OCCURRED FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE  30, 2019 AND 2018.  WEBSITE  DEVELOPMENT COSTS  IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE COMPANY ENGAGED A THIRD  PARTY VENDOR TO RE-DEVELOP ITS WEBSITE. UPON COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT IN JUNE 2019, THE COMPANY CAPITALIZED THE RELATED WEBSITE  DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF $46,500 IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB CODIFICATION ASC 350-50 \u201cACCOUNTING FOR WEB SITE DEVELOPMENT COSTS\u201d,  WHICH WAS REPORTED IN OTHER ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF JUNE 30, 2019. BEGINNING IN THE QUARTER ENDING SEPTEMBER  30, 2019, THE COMPANY WILL AMORTIZE THE WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT COSTS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THREE YEARS, THE ESTIMATED USEFUL  LIFE OF THE WEBSITE. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO REVIEW ITS CAPITALIZED WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT COSTS PERIODICALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT.  9  IMPAIRMENT  OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  OFFICE  FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE LIVES ARE EVALUATED AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES  IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  IN THE EVENT THE NET BOOK VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH ASSETS.  IF THE SUM OF THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS, A  LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS. SUCH  ANALYSES NECESSARILY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT.  THE  COMPANY DID NOT RECORD ANY IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018.  FAIR  VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  FASB  ASC 820 \u2014  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES,  DEFINES FAIR VALUE AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL  AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. FASB ASC  820 REQUIRES DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, WHETHER OR NOT RECOGNIZED, FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT  PURPOSES. DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE BASED ON PERTINENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY  ON JUNE 30, 2019. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTIMATES PRESENTED IN THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE AMOUNTS  THAT COULD BE REALIZED ON DISPOSITION OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  FASB  ASC 820 SPECIFIES A HIERARCHY OF VALUATION TECHNIQUES BASED ON WHETHER THE INPUTS TO THOSE VALUATION TECHNIQUES ARE OBSERVABLE  OR UNOBSERVABLE. OBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT MARKET DATA OBTAINED FROM INDEPENDENT SOURCES, WHILE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT MARKET  ASSUMPTIONS. THE HIERARCHY GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES  (LEVEL 1 MEASUREMENT) AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENT).  THE  THREE LEVELS OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u25cf  LEVEL  1 \u2014 QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES THAT THE REPORTING ENTITY HAS THE ABILITY TO  ACCESS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. LEVEL 1 PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHOSE VALUE IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET  PRICES SUCH AS EXCHANGE-TRADED INSTRUMENTS AND LISTED EQUITIES.  \u25cf  LEVEL  2 \u2014 INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES INCLUDED WITHIN LEVEL 1 THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY  OR INDIRECTLY. LEVEL 2 INCLUDES FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE VALUED USING MODELS OR OTHER VALUATION METHODOLOGIES. THESE  MODELS CONSIDER VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY FACTORS, CURRENT MARKET PRICES AND CONTRACTUAL PRICES FOR THE UNDERLYING  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKETPLACE, CAN BE DERIVED FROM OBSERVABLE  DATA OR ARE SUPPORTED BY OBSERVABLE LEVELS AT WHICH TRANSACTIONS ARE EXECUTED IN THE MARKETPLACE.  \u25cf  LEVEL  3 \u2014 UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE CONSIDERED LEVEL 3 WHEN THEIR FAIR VALUES  ARE DETERMINED USING PRICING MODELS, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR SIMILAR TECHNIQUES AND AT LEAST ONE SIGNIFICANT MODEL ASSUMPTION  OR INPUT IS UNOBSERVABLE.  THE  CARRYING AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET FOR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CONTRACTS AND GRANTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS  PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES, AND ACCRUED COMPENSATION APPROXIMATE THEIR FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE SHORT-TERM MATURITY OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.  REVENUE  RECOGNITION  THE  COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY GENERATED FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND GRANTS. THE REVENUE FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND  GRANTS IS BASED UPON SUBCONTRACTOR COSTS AND INTERNAL COSTS INCURRED THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY COVERED BY THE CONTRACTS AND GRANTS,  PLUS A FACILITIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE RATE THAT PROVIDES FUNDING FOR OVERHEAD EXPENSES AND MANAGEMENT FEES. THESE REVENUES ARE  RECOGNIZED WHEN EXPENSES HAVE BEEN INCURRED BY SUBCONTRACTORS OR WHEN THE COMPANY INCURS REIMBURSABLE INTERNAL EXPENSES THAT ARE  RELATED TO THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND GRANTS.  10  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE WHEN INCURRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB ASC 730,  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  . RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT INCLUDES COSTS SUCH AS CLINICAL TRIAL EXPENSES, CONTRACTED RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENT FEES WITH NO ALTERNATIVE  FUTURE USE, SUPPLIES AND MATERIALS, SALARIES, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, EQUIPMENT DEPRECIATION AND ALLOCATION  OF VARIOUS CORPORATE COSTS. PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE REPRESENTS THE VALUE ASSIGNED OR PAID FOR ACQUIRED  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR WHICH THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE AS OF THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.  SHARE-BASED  COMPENSATION  STOCK  OPTIONS ARE ISSUED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT. STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED TO DIRECTORS UPON  RE-ELECTION VEST QUARTERLY FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR (NEW DIRECTOR ISSUANCES ARE FULLY VESTED UPON ISSUANCE). STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED  TO EMPLOYEES GENERALLY VEST 25% ON THE GRANT DATE, THEN 25% EACH SUBSEQUENT YEAR FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS. THESE OPTIONS HAVE  A TEN YEAR LIFE FOR AS LONG AS THE INDIVIDUALS REMAIN EMPLOYEES OR DIRECTORS. IN GENERAL, WHEN AN EMPLOYEE OR DIRECTOR TERMINATES  THEIR POSITION, THE OPTIONS WILL EXPIRE WITHIN THREE MONTHS, UNLESS OTHERWISE EXTENDED BY THE BOARD.  FROM  TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ISSUES RESTRICTED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO VENDORS AND CONSULTANTS AS COMPENSATION FOR SERVICES PERFORMED.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB AMENDED THE ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ISSUED TO NONEMPLOYEES IN ASU 2018-07. UNDER THE REVISED  GUIDANCE, THE SCOPE OF TOPIC 718 WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS ISSUED TO NONEMPLOYEES, SUPERSEDES SUBTOPIC 505-50  AND GENERALLY ALIGNS THE ACCOUNTING FOR AWARDS ISSUED TO NONEMPLOYEES TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE AWARDS. THE COMPANY ADOPTED  THE NEW GUIDANCE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW GUIDANCE, STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR EQUITY-CLASSIFIED  AWARDS TO NONEMPLOYEES IS MEASURED ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED. THE ADOPTION OF ASU  2018-07 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  DURING  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, THE COMPANY ISSUED 74,300 COMMON STOCK OPTIONS AT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXERCISE PRICE  OF $0.93 PER SHARE, AND 600 COMMON STOCK OPTIONS AT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXERCISE PRICE OF $1.59 PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR  VALUE OF OPTIONS ISSUED DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018 WERE ESTIMATED USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION-PRICING  MODEL AND THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS.  \u25cf  A  DIVIDEND YIELD OF 0%;  \u25cf  AN  EXPECTED LIFE OF 4 YEARS;  \u25cf  VOLATILITY RANGING FROM 90.87% - 92.93% FOR 2019 AND FROM 91.17%-91.18% FOR 2018;  \u25cf  FORFEITURES  AT A RATE OF 12%; AND  \u25cf  RISK FREE INTEREST RATES RANGING FROM 1.84% - 2.50% FOR 2019 AND FROM 2.68%-2.85% FOR 2018.  THE  FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION GRANT MADE DURING 2019 WAS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF EACH GRANT USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING  MODEL AND RECOGNIZED AS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RATABLY OVER THE OPTION VESTING PERIODS, WHICH APPROXIMATES THE SERVICE  PERIOD.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE  COMPANY ISSUED 197,019 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO THIRD-PARTY VENDORS AS PARTIAL CONSIDERATION FOR SERVICES PERFORMED. IN ACCORDANCE  WITH ASU 2018-07, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $107,447 OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES, CAPITALIZED $46,500 OF WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT  COSTS, AND RECORDED $7,110 OF PREPAID VENDOR SERVICE EXPENSES BASED ON THE MARKET PRICES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK ON  THE ISSUE DATES. THE COMPANY DID NOT ISSUE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO THIRD PARTY VENDORS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  FOREIGN  CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSLATION  IN  2018, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE STATUS OF A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (\u201cUK\u201d) FROM INACTIVE TO  ACTIVE AND INCURRED EXPENDITURES IN MULTIPLE CURRENCIES INCLUDING THE U.S. DOLLAR, THE BRITISH POUND AND THE EURO TO FUND ITS  CLINICAL TRIAL OPERATIONS IN THE UK AND SELECT COUNTRIES IN EUROPE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 830  FOREIGN CURRENCY  MATTERS  , THE UK SUBSIDIARY EXPRESSES ITS U.S. DOLLAR AND EURO DENOMINATED TRANSACTIONS IN ITS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, THE  BRITISH POUND, WITH RELATED TRANSACTION GAINS OR LOSSES INCLUDED IN NET LOSS. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  OF THE UK SUBSIDIARY ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AND CONSOLIDATED INTO THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIALS, WITH RELATED  TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS REPORTED AS A CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT (\u201cCTA\u201d), WHICH IS A COMPONENT OF  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY DID NOT INCUR ANY MATERIAL  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION OR TRANSLATION GAIN OR LOSS. NO FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION OR TRANSLATION GAIN OR LOSS WAS  RECORDED IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  11  INCOME  TAXES  DEFERRED  TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT  CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASIS. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED WHEN  IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT ALL OR A PORTION OF A DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED. A REVIEW OF ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE  AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE IS CONSIDERED, INCLUDING THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT AND PAST PERFORMANCE, THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH  THE COMPANY OPERATES, THE UTILIZATION OF PAST TAX CREDITS, AND THE LENGTH OF CARRYBACK AND CARRYFORWARD PERIODS. DEFERRED TAX  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED UTILIZING TAX RATES EXPECTED TO APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY  DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $610,676 FROM THE SALE OF  NEW JERSEY NOL CARRYFORWARD DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. NO INCOME TAX BENEFIT WAS RECOGNIZED FOR THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, IF ANY, AS  PART OF THE INCOME TAX PROVISION. THERE WERE NO TAX RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RECORDED FOR THE PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  OR 2018. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECORDED AN ASSET FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OR A LIABILITY FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS  AT JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018.  EARNINGS  PER SHARE  BASIC  EARNINGS PER SHARE (\u201cEPS\u201d) EXCLUDES DILUTION AND IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME (LOSS) AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS  BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD. DILUTED EPS REFLECTS THE POTENTIAL DILUTION THAT COULD  OCCUR IF SECURITIES OR OTHER CONTRACTS TO ISSUE COMMON STOCK WERE EXERCISED OR CONVERTED INTO COMMON STOCK OR RESULTED IN THE  ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK THAT SHARED IN THE EARNINGS OF THE ENTITY. SINCE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OPTIONS AND WARRANTS  OUTSTANDING, FLUCTUATIONS IN THE ACTUAL MARKET PRICE CAN HAVE A VARIETY OF RESULTS FOR EACH PERIOD PRESENTED.  THE  FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES WHICH WERE EXCLUDED  FROM THE CALCULATION BECAUSE THEIR EFFECT WOULD BE ANTI-DILUTIVE.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30,  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30,  2019  2018  2019  2018  COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS  6,303,643  2,575,988  6,303,643  2,575,988  STOCK OPTIONS  1,093,032  761,855  1,093,032  761,855  TOTAL  7,396,675  3,337,843  7,396,675  3,337,843  THE  WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS OUTSTANDING AT JUNE 30, 2019 WERE $4.97 AND  $3.09 PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY, AND AT JUNE 30, 2018 WERE $7.25 AND $4.38 PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY.  USE  OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS  THE  PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. REQUIRES MANAGEMENT  TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS THE FAIR VALUE OF WARRANTS AND STOCK OPTIONS AND THE USEFUL LIFE OF INTANGIBLES THAT  AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

PORTIONS OF THESE NOLS WILL BEGIN TO EXPIRE IN 2019.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS $8,333,000 OF VARIOUS TAX CREDITS WHICH EXPIRE FROM 2019 TO 2037. THE COMPANY MAY BE ABLE TO UTILIZE  ITS NOLS TO REDUCE FUTURE FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, THESE NOLS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LIMITATIONS UNDER  INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (\u201cIRC\u201d) SECTION 382. IRC SECTION 382 LIMITS THE USE OF NOLS TO THE EXTENT THERE HAS BEEN AN  OWNERSHIP CHANGE OF MORE THAN 50 PERCENTAGE POINTS. IN ADDITION, THE NOL CARRYFORWARDS ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING  AUTHORITY AND COULD BE ADJUSTED OR DISALLOWED DUE TO SUCH EXAMS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS NOT UNDERGONE AN IRC SECTION 382 ANALYSIS,  IT IS LIKELY THAT THE UTILIZATION OF THE NOLS MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY LIMITED.  14  THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY  BUSINESS TAX CERTIFICATE PROGRAM ALLOWS CERTAIN HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES TO SELL UNUSED NOL CARRYFORWARDS TO  OTHER NEW JERSEY-BASED CORPORATE TAXPAYERS.

CHIEFLY, THIS LEGISLATION IMPOSES  A 2.5% SURTAX ON TAXPAYERS WITH ALLOCATED NET INCOME OVER $1 MILLION FOR 2018 AND 2019, AND A 1.5% SURTAX FOR TAXPAYERS WITH ALLOCATED  NET INCOME OVER $1 MILLION FOR 2020 AND 2021. FURTHER, THERE ARE CHANGES TO THE STATE\u2019S COMPUTATION OF ITS DIVIDEND RECEIVED  DEDUCTION AND APPLICATION OF IRC SECTION 163(J).

SPECIALIZED  BIOTHERAPEUTICS OVERVIEW  SGX301  \u2013 FOR TREATING CUTANEOUS T-CELL LYMPHOMA  SGX301  IS A NOVEL, FIRST-IN-CLASS, PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY THAT UTILIZES SAFE VISIBLE LIGHT FOR ACTIVATION. THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IN SGX301  IS SYNTHETIC HYPERICIN, A PHOTOSENSITIZER WHICH IS TOPICALLY APPLIED TO SKIN LESIONS AND THEN ACTIVATED BY FLUORESCENT LIGHT 16  TO 24 HOURS LATER. HYPERICIN IS ALSO FOUND IN SEVERAL SPECIES OF  HYPERICUM  PLANTS, ALTHOUGH THE DRUG USED IN SGX301 IS  CHEMICALLY SYNTHESIZED BY A PROPRIETARY MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND NOT EXTRACTED FROM PLANTS. IMPORTANTLY, HYPERICIN IS OPTIMALLY  ACTIVATED WITH VISIBLE LIGHT THEREBY AVOIDING THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT. OTHER LIGHT THERAPIES USING UVA  LIGHT RESULT IN SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS INCLUDING SECONDARY SKIN CANCERS.  COMBINED  WITH PHOTOACTIVATION, IN CLINICAL TRIALS SYNTHETIC HYPERICIN HAS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT ANTI-PROLIFERATIVE EFFECTS ON ACTIVATED  NORMAL HUMAN LYMPHOID CELLS AND INHIBITED GROWTH OF MALIGNANT T-CELLS ISOLATED FROM CTCL PATIENTS. IN BOTH SETTINGS, IT APPEARS  THAT THE MODE OF ACTION IS AN INDUCTION OF CELL DEATH IN A CONCENTRATION AS WELL AS A LIGHT DOSE-DEPENDENT FASHION. THESE EFFECTS  APPEAR TO RESULT, IN PART, FROM THE GENERATION OF SINGLET OXYGEN DURING PHOTOACTIVATION OF HYPERICIN.  HYPERICIN  IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT KNOWN GENERATORS OF SINGLET OXYGEN, THE KEY COMPONENT FOR PHOTOTHERAPY. THE GENERATION OF SINGLET  OXYGEN INDUCES NECROSIS AND APOPTOSIS IN ADJACENT CELLS. THE USE OF TOPICAL SYNTHETIC HYPERICIN COUPLED WITH DIRECTED VISIBLE  LIGHT RESULTS IN GENERATION OF SINGLET OXYGEN ONLY AT THE TREATED SITE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE USE OF VISIBLE LIGHT (AS OPPOSED TO  CANCER-CAUSING ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT) IS A MAJOR ADVANCE IN PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY. IN A PUBLISHED PHASE 2 CLINICAL STUDY IN CTCL, AFTER  SIX WEEKS OF TWICE WEEKLY THERAPY, A MAJORITY OF PATIENTS EXPERIENCED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P  <  0.04) IMPROVEMENT  WITH SGX301 WHEREAS THE PLACEBO WAS INEFFECTIVE: 58.3% COMPARED TO 8.3%, RESPECTIVELY.  21  SGX301  HAS RECEIVED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION AS WELL AS FAST TRACK DESIGNATION FROM THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d).  THE ORPHAN DRUG ACT IS INTENDED TO ASSIST AND ENCOURAGE COMPANIES TO DEVELOP SAFE AND EFFECTIVE THERAPIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF  RARE DISEASES AND DISORDERS. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING A SEVEN-YEAR TERM OF MARKET EXCLUSIVITY FOR SGX301 UPON FINAL FDA APPROVAL,  ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION ALSO POSITIONS US TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE A WIDE RANGE OF FINANCIAL AND REGULATORY BENEFITS, INCLUDING  GOVERNMENT GRANTS FOR CONDUCTING CLINICAL TRIALS, WAIVER OF FDA USER FEES FOR THE POTENTIAL SUBMISSION OF A NEW DRUG APPLICATION  (\u201cNDA\u201d) FOR SGX301, AND CERTAIN TAX CREDITS. IN ADDITION, FAST TRACK IS A DESIGNATION THAT THE FDA RESERVES FOR A  DRUG INTENDED TO TREAT A SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION AND ONE THAT DEMONSTRATES THE POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS AN UNMET MEDICAL  NEED FOR THE CONDITION. FAST TRACK DESIGNATION IS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPEDITE THE REVIEW OF NEW DRUGS.  FOR INSTANCE, SHOULD EVENTS WARRANT, WE WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO SUBMIT A NDA FOR SGX301 ON A ROLLING BASIS, PERMITTING THE FDA TO  REVIEW SECTIONS OF THE NDA PRIOR TO RECEIVING THE COMPLETE SUBMISSION. ADDITIONALLY, NDAS FOR FAST TRACK DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS  ORDINARILY WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR PRIORITY REVIEW. SGX301 FOR THE TREATMENT OF CTCL ALSO WAS GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION FROM  THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY (\u201cEMA\u201d) COMMITTEE FOR ORPHAN MEDICAL PRODUCTS AND PROMISING INNOVATIVE MEDICINE (\u201cPIM\u201d)  DESIGNATION FROM THE MEDICINES AND HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS REGULATORY AGENCY (\u201cMHRA\u201d) IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (\u201cUK\u201d).  IN  AUGUST 2018, THE U.S. PATENT OFFICE GRANTED US A PATENT TITLED \u201cSYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PRODUCING SYNTHETIC HYPERICIN\u201d  FOR THE UNIQUE PROPRIETARY PROCESS MANUFACTURING THE HIGHLY PURIFIED FORM OF SYNTHETIC HYPERICIN, THE ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT  IN SGX301.  WE  INITIATED OUR PIVOTAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL STUDY OF SGX301 FOR THE TREATMENT OF CTCL DURING DECEMBER 2015. THIS TRIAL, REFERRED TO  AS THE \u201cFLASH\u201d STUDY (  F  LUORESCENT  L  IGHT  A  CTIVATED  S  YNTHETIC  H  YPERICIN), AIMS TO  EVALUATE THE RESPONSE TO SGX301 AS A SKIN DIRECTED THERAPY TO TREAT EARLY STAGE CTCL. WE ARE ACTIVELY ENROLLING PATIENTS WITH  APPROXIMATELY 35 CTCL CENTERS ACROSS THE U.S. PARTICIPATING IN THIS PIVOTAL TRIAL. THE PHASE 3 PROTOCOL IS A HIGHLY POWERED, DOUBLE-BLIND,  RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, MULTICENTER TRIAL AND SEEKS TO ENROLL APPROXIMATELY 160 EVALUABLE SUBJECTS. THE TRIAL CONSISTS  OF THREE TREATMENT CYCLES, EACH OF EIGHT WEEKS DURATION. TREATMENTS ARE ADMINISTERED TWICE WEEKLY FOR THE FIRST SIX WEEKS AND  TREATMENT RESPONSE IS DETERMINED AT THE END OF THE EIGHTH WEEK. IN THE FIRST TREATMENT CYCLE, APPROXIMATELY 107 SUBJECTS RECEIVE  SGX301 AND 53 RECEIVE PLACEBO TREATMENT OF THEIR INDEX LESIONS. IN THE SECOND CYCLE, ALL SUBJECTS RECEIVE SGX301 TREATMENT OF  THEIR INDEX LESIONS, AND IN THE THIRD CYCLE ALL SUBJECTS RECEIVE SGX301 TREATMENT OF ALL OF THEIR LESIONS. THE MAJORITY OF SUBJECTS  ENROLLED TO DATE HAVE ELECTED TO CONTINUE INTO THE THIRD OPTIONAL, OPEN-LABEL CYCLE OF THE STUDY. WE CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY  WITH THE CUTANEOUS LYMPHOMA FOUNDATION, AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR RARE DISORDERS. SUBJECTS ARE FOLLOWED FOR AN  ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS AFTER THEIR LAST EVALUATION VISIT. THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT IS ASSESSED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS  IN EACH OF THE TWO TREATMENT GROUPS (I.E., SGX301 AND PLACEBO) ACHIEVING A PARTIAL OR COMPLETE RESPONSE OF THE TREATED LESIONS,  DEFINED AS A \u2265 50% REDUCTION IN THE TOTAL COMPOSITE ASSESSMENT OF INDEX LESION DISEASE SEVERITY (\u201cCAILS\u201d) SCORE  FOR THREE INDEX LESIONS AT THE CYCLE 1 EVALUATION VISIT (WEEK 8) COMPARED TO THE TOTAL CAILS SCORE AT BASELINE. OTHER SECONDARY  MEASURES ASSESS TREATMENT RESPONSE INCLUDING DURATION, DEGREE OF IMPROVEMENT, TIME TO RELAPSE AND SAFETY.  DURING  SEPTEMBER 2017, THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (\u201cNCI\u201d), PART OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (\u201cNIH\u201d)  AWARDED US A SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (\u201cSBIR\u201d) GRANT OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION OVER TWO YEARS TO SUPPORT  THE CONDUCT OF OUR PIVOTAL, PHASE 3, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDY EVALUATING SGX301 (SYNTHETIC HYPERICIN)  AS A TREATMENT FOR CTCL.  DURING  OCTOBER 2018, AN INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE (\u201cDMC\u201d) COMPLETED AN UNBLINDED INTERIM ANALYSIS WITH DATA FROM  APPROXIMATELY 100 SUBJECTS, INCLUDING AN ASSESSMENT OF THE PHASE 3 FLASH STUDY\u2019S PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT. THE DMC PROVIDED  A POSITIVE RECOMMENDATION TO RANDOMIZE APPROXIMATELY 40 ADDITIONAL SUBJECTS INTO THE TRIAL TO MAINTAIN THE RIGOROUS ASSUMPTION  OF 90% STATISTICAL POWER FOR THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT. NO SAFETY CONCERNS WERE REPORTED BY THE DMC BASED ON THE INTERIM ANALYSIS.  WE  ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL WORLDWIDE MARKET FOR SGX301 IS IN EXCESS OF $250 MILLION FOR ALL APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THE TREATMENT  OF CTCL. THIS POTENTIAL MARKET INFORMATION IS A FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT, AND INVESTORS ARE URGED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE  ON THIS STATEMENT. WHILE WE HAVE DETERMINED THIS POTENTIAL MARKET SIZE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE, THERE  ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OUR EXPECTATIONS TO CHANGE OR NOT BE REALIZED.  22  CUTANEOUS  T-CELL LYMPHOMA  CTCL  IS A CLASS OF NON-HODGKIN\u2019S LYMPHOMA (\u201cNHL\u201d), A TYPE OF CANCER OF THE WHITE BLOOD CELLS THAT ARE AN INTEGRAL  PART OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. UNLIKE MOST NHLS, WHICH GENERALLY INVOLVE B-CELL LYMPHOCYTES (INVOLVED IN PRODUCING ANTIBODIES), CTCL  IS CAUSED BY AN EXPANSION OF MALIGNANT T-CELL LYMPHOCYTES (INVOLVED IN CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNITY) NORMALLY PROGRAMMED TO MIGRATE  TO THE SKIN. THESE SKIN-TRAFFICKING MALIGNANT T-CELLS MIGRATE TO THE SKIN, CAUSING VARIOUS LESIONS TO APPEAR THAT MAY CHANGE SHAPE  AS THE DISEASE PROGRESSES, TYPICALLY BEGINNING AS A RASH AND EVENTUALLY FORMING PLAQUES AND TUMORS. MYCOSIS FUNGOIDES (\u201cMF\u201d)  IS THE MOST COMMON FORM OF CTCL. IT GENERALLY PRESENTS WITH SKIN INVOLVEMENT ONLY, MANIFESTED AS SCALY, ERYTHEMATOUS PATCHES.  ADVANCED DISEASE WITH DIFFUSE LYMPH NODE AND VISCERAL ORGAN INVOLVEMENT IS USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A POORER RESPONSE RATE TO STANDARD  THERAPIES. A RELATIVELY UNCOMMON SUB-GROUP OF CTCL PATIENTS PRESENT WITH EXTENSIVE SKIN INVOLVEMENT AND CIRCULATING MALIGNANT  CEREBRIFORM T-CELLS, REFERRED TO AS SE\u0301ZARY SYNDROME. THESE PATIENTS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY GRAVER PROGNOSES (EXPECTED FIVE-YEAR  SURVIVAL RATE OF 24%), THAN THOSE WITH MF (EXPECTED FIVE-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE OF 88%).  CTCL  MORTALITY IS RELATED TO STAGE OF DISEASE, WITH MEDIAN SURVIVAL GENERALLY RANGING FROM ABOUT 12 YEARS IN THE EARLY STAGES TO ONLY  2.5 YEARS WHEN THE DISEASE HAS ADVANCED. THERE IS CURRENTLY NO FDA-APPROVED DRUG FOR FRONT-LINE TREATMENT OF EARLY STAGE CTCL.  TREATMENT OF EARLY-STAGE DISEASE GENERALLY INVOLVES SKIN-DIRECTED THERAPIES. ONE OF THE MOST COMMON UNAPPROVED THERAPIES USED  FOR EARLY-STAGE DISEASE IS ORAL 5 OR 8-METHOXYPSORALEN (\u201cPSORALEN\u201d) GIVEN WITH ULTRAVIOLET A (\u201cUVA\u201d) LIGHT,  REFERRED TO AS PUVA, WHICH IS APPROVED FOR DERMATOLOGICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS DISABLING PSORIASIS NOT ADEQUATELY RESPONSIVE TO  OTHER FORMS OF THERAPY, IDIOPATHIC VITILIGO AND SKIN MANIFESTATIONS OF CTCL IN PERSONS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN RESPONSIVE TO OTHER FORMS  OF TREATMENT. PSORALEN IS A MUTAGENIC CHEMICAL THAT INTERFERES WITH DNA CAUSING MUTATIONS AND OTHER MALIGNANCIES. MOREOVER, UVA  IS A CARCINOGENIC LIGHT SOURCE THAT WHEN COMBINED WITH THE PSORALEN, RESULTS IN SERIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS INCLUDING SECONDARY SKIN  CANCERS; THEREFORE, THE FDA REQUIRES A BLACK BOX WARNING FOR PUVA.  CTCL  CONSTITUTES A RARE GROUP OF NHLS, OCCURRING IN ABOUT 4% OF THE APPROXIMATE 500,000 INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH NHL. WE ESTIMATE, BASED  UPON REVIEW OF HISTORIC PUBLISHED STUDIES AND REPORTS AND AN INTERPOLATION OF DATA ON THE INCIDENCE OF CTCL, THAT IT AFFECTS OVER  20,000 INDIVIDUALS IN THE U.S., WITH APPROXIMATELY 2,800 NEW CASES SEEN ANNUALLY.  DUSQUETIDE  DUSQUETIDE  (RESEARCH NAME: SGX94) IS AN INNATE DEFENSE REGULATOR (\u201cIDR\u201d) THAT REGULATES THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO SIMULTANEOUSLY  REDUCE INFLAMMATION, ELIMINATE INFECTION AND ENHANCE TISSUE HEALING.  DUSQUETIDE  IS BASED ON A NEW CLASS OF SHORT, SYNTHETIC PEPTIDES KNOWN AS IDRS. IT HAS A NOVEL MECHANISM OF ACTION IN THAT IT MODULATES THE  BODY\u2019S REACTION TO BOTH INJURY AND INFECTION AND IS BOTH SIMULTANEOUSLY ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND ANTI-INFECTIVE. IDRS HAVE  NO DIRECT ANTIBIOTIC ACTIVITY BUT MODULATE HOST RESPONSES, INCREASING SURVIVAL AFTER INFECTIONS WITH A BROAD RANGE OF BACTERIAL  GRAM-NEGATIVE AND GRAM-POSITIVE PATHOGENS INCLUDING BOTH ANTIBIOTIC SENSITIVE AND RESISTANT STRAINS, AS WELL AS ACCELERATING RESOLUTION  OF TISSUE DAMAGE FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO A VARIETY OF AGENTS INCLUDING BACTERIAL PATHOGENS, TRAUMA AND CHEMO- OR RADIATION-THERAPY.  IDRS REPRESENT A NOVEL APPROACH TO THE CONTROL OF INFECTION AND TISSUE DAMAGE VIA HIGHLY SELECTIVE BINDING TO AN INTRACELLULAR  ADAPTOR PROTEIN, SEQUESTOSOME-1, ALSO KNOWN AS P62, WHICH HAS A PIVOTAL FUNCTION IN SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION DURING ACTIVATION AND  CONTROL OF THE INNATE DEFENSE SYSTEM. PRECLINICAL DATA INDICATE THAT IDRS MAY BE ACTIVE IN MODELS OF A WIDE RANGE OF THERAPEUTIC  INDICATIONS INCLUDING LIFE-THREATENING BACTERIAL INFECTIONS AS WELL AS THE SEVERE SIDE-EFFECTS OF CHEMO- AND RADIATION-THERAPY.  ADDITIONALLY, DUE TO SELECTIVE BINDING TO P62, DUSQUETIDE MAY HAVE POTENTIAL ANTI-TUMOR ACTION.  DUSQUETIDE  HAS DEMONSTRATED EFFICACY IN NUMEROUS ANIMAL DISEASE MODELS INCLUDING MUCOSITIS, COLITIS, SKIN INFECTION AND OTHER BACTERIAL INFECTIONS  AND HAS BEEN EVALUATED IN A DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED PHASE 1 CLINICAL TRIAL IN 84 HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS WITH BOTH SINGLE  ASCENDING DOSE AND MULTIPLE ASCENDING DOSE COMPONENTS. DUSQUETIDE WAS SHOWN TO HAVE A GOOD SAFETY PROFILE AND BE WELL-TOLERATED  IN ALL DOSE GROUPS WHEN ADMINISTERED BY IV OVER 7 DAYS AND WAS CONSISTENT WITH SAFETY RESULTS SEEN IN PRE-CLINICAL STUDIES. WE  BELIEVE THAT MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR DUSQUETIDE INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, ORAL AND GASTROINTESTINAL MUCOSITIS, ACUTE GRAM-POSITIVE  BACTERIAL INFECTIONS (E.G., METHICILLIN RESISTANT  STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS  (MRSA)), ACUTE GRAM-NEGATIVE INFECTIONS (E.G.,  ACINETOBACTER, MELIOIDOSIS), AND ACUTE RADIATION SYNDROME.  23  SGX942  \u2013 FOR TREATING ORAL MUCOSITIS IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER  SGX942  IS OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATE CONTAINING OUR IDR TECHNOLOGY, DUSQUETIDE, TARGETING THE TREATMENT OF ORAL MUCOSITIS IN HEAD AND NECK  CANCER PATIENTS. ORAL MUCOSITIS IN THIS PATIENT POPULATION IS AN AREA OF UNMET MEDICAL NEED WHERE THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO APPROVED  DRUG THERAPIES. ACCORDINGLY, WE RECEIVED FAST TRACK DESIGNATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF ORAL MUCOSITIS AS A RESULT OF RADIATION AND/OR  CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENT IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER PATIENTS FROM THE FDA. IN ADDITION, DUSQUETIDE HAS BEEN GRANTED PIM DESIGNATION  IN THE UK BY THE MHRA FOR THE TREATMENT OF SEVERE ORAL MUCOSITIS IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMORADIATION THERAPY.  THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE AND THE EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE GRANTED US THE PATENT TITLED \u201cNOVEL PEPTIDES AND ANALOGS  FOR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF ORAL MUCOSITIS\u201d ON AUGUST 16, 2016 AND JANUARY 23, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE NEWLY ISSUED PATENT  CLAIMS THERAPEUTIC USE OF DUSQUETIDE AND RELATED IDR ANALOGS, AND ADDS TO COMPOSITION OF MATTER CLAIMS FOR DUSQUETIDE AND RELATED  ANALOGS THAT HAVE BEEN GRANTED IN THE U.S. AND WORLDWIDE.  WE  INITIATED A PHASE 2 CLINICAL STUDY OF SGX942 FOR THE TREATMENT OF ORAL MUCOSITIS IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER PATIENTS IN DECEMBER  OF 2013. WE COMPLETED ENROLLMENT IN THIS TRIAL IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2015, AND IN DECEMBER 2015 RELEASED POSITIVE PRELIMINARY  RESULTS. IN THIS PHASE 2 PROOF-OF-CONCEPT CLINICAL STUDY THAT ENROLLED 111 PATIENTS, SGX942, AT A DOSE OF 1.5 MG/KG, SUCCESSFULLY  REDUCED THE MEDIAN DURATION OF SEVERE ORAL MUCOSITIS BY 50%, FROM 18 DAYS TO 9 DAYS (P=0.099) IN ALL PATIENTS AND BY 67%, FROM  30 DAYS TO 10 DAYS (P=0.040) IN PATIENTS RECEIVING THE MOST AGGRESSIVE CHEMORADIATION THERAPY FOR TREATMENT OF THEIR HEAD AND  NECK CANCER. THE P-VALUES MET THE PROSPECTIVELY DEFINED STATISTICAL THRESHOLD OF P<0.1 IN THE STUDY PROTOCOL. A LESS SEVERE  OCCURRENCE OF ORAL MUCOSITIS, ULCERATIVE ORAL MUCOSITIS (DEFINED AS ORAL MUCOSITIS WITH A WHO SCORE \u22652 CORRESPONDING TO THE  OCCURRENCE OF OVERT ULCERATION IN THE MOUTH), WAS ALSO MONITORED DURING THE STUDY. IN THE PATIENTS RECEIVING THE MOST AGGRESSIVE  CHEMORADIATION THERAPY, THE MEDIAN DURATION OF ORAL MUCOSITIS WAS FOUND TO DECREASE FROM 65 DAYS IN THE PLACEBO TREATED PATIENTS  TO 51 DAYS IN THE PATIENTS TREATED WITH SGX942 1.5 MG/KG (P=0.099).  IN  ADDITION TO IDENTIFYING THE BEST DOSE OF 1.5 MG/KG, THIS STUDY ACHIEVED ALL OBJECTIVES, INCLUDING INCREASED INCIDENCE OF \u201cCOMPLETE  RESPONSE\u201d OF TUMOR AT THE ONE MONTH FOLLOW-UP VISIT (47% IN PLACEBO VS. 63% IN SGX942 AT 1.5 MG/KG). DECREASES IN MORTALITY  AND DECREASES IN INFECTION RATE WERE ALSO OBSERVED WITH SGX942 TREATMENT, CONSISTENT WITH THE PRECLINICAL RESULTS OBSERVED IN  ANIMAL MODELS.  SGX942  WAS FOUND TO BE GENERALLY SAFE AND WELL TOLERATED, CONSISTENT WITH THE SAFETY PROFILE OBSERVED IN THE PRIOR PHASE 1 STUDY CONDUCTED  IN 84 HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. THE LONG-TERM (12 MONTH) FOLLOW-UP DATA WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRELIMINARY POSITIVE SAFETY AND EFFICACY  FINDINGS. WHILE THE PLACEBO POPULATION EXPERIENCED THE EXPECTED 12-MONTH SURVIVAL RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 80%, AS DEFINED IN THE  SURVEILLANCE, EPIDEMIOLOGY, AND END RESULTS STATISTICS 1975-2012 FROM THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE, THE SGX942 1.5 MG/KG TREATMENT  GROUP REPORTED A 12-MONTH SURVIVAL RATE OF 93% (7% MORTALITY IN THE SGX942 1.5 MG/KG GROUP COMPARED TO 19% IN THE PLACEBO GROUP).  SIMILARLY, TUMOR RESOLUTION (COMPLETE RESPONSE) AT 12 MONTHS WAS BETTER IN THE SGX942 1.5 MG/KG TREATMENT GROUP RELATIVE TO THE  PLACEBO POPULATION (80% IN THE 1.5 MG/KG GROUP COMPARED TO 74% IN THE PLACEBO GROUP). MOREOVER, IN THE PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY  EVERY THIRD WEEK, THE SGX942 1.5 MG/KG TREATMENT GROUP HAD A TUMOR RESOLUTION RATE (COMPLETE RESPONSE) OF 82% THROUGHOUT THE 12  MONTHS FOLLOWING CHEMORADIATION THERAPY, WHILE THE PLACEBO GROUP EXPERIENCED A 64% COMPLETE RESPONSE RATE. THE LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP  RESULTS FROM THE PHASE 2 STUDY ARE REVIEWED IN \u201cDUSQUETIDE: REDUCTION IN ORAL MUCOSITIS ASSOCIATED WITH ENDURING ANCILLARY  BENEFITS IN TUMOR RESOLUTION AND DECREASED MORTALITY IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER PATIENTS\u201d PUBLISHED ONLINE IN BIOTECHNOLOGY  REPORTS AND AVAILABLE AT THE FOLLOWING LINK: HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1016/J.BTRE.2017.05.002. IN ADDITION TO SAFETY, EVALUATIONS OF  OTHER SECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS, SUCH AS THE UTILIZATION OF OPIOID PAIN MEDICATION, INDICATED THAT THE SGX942 1.5MG/KG TREATMENT  GROUP HAD A 40% DECREASE IN THE USE OF OPIOIDS AT THE LATER STAGE OF THE TREATMENT PHASE OF THE TRIAL, WHEN ORAL MUCOSITIS IS  USUALLY MOST SEVERE AND EXPECTED TO INCREASE PAIN MEDICATION USE. THIS WAS IN CONTRAST TO THE PLACEBO GROUP, WHICH DEMONSTRATED  A 10% INCREASE IN USE OF OPIOIDS OVER THIS SAME PERIOD. DATA FROM THIS PHASE 2 TRIAL WAS PUBLISHED ONLINE IN THE JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY.  THE PUBLICATION ALSO DELINEATES THE SUPPORTIVE NONCLINICAL DATA IN THIS INDICATION, DEMONSTRATING CONSISTENCY IN THE QUALITATIVE  AND QUANTITATIVE BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE, INCLUDING DOSE RESPONSE, ACROSS THE NONCLINICAL AND CLINICAL DATA SETS. THE RESULTS ARE  AVAILABLE AT THE FOLLOWING LINK: HTTP://AUTHORS.ELSERVIER.COM/SD/ARTICLE/S01681656116315668.  24  ON  SEPTEMBER 9, 2016, WE AND SCICLONE PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. (\u201cSCICLONE\u201d) ENTERED INTO AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT,  PURSUANT TO WHICH WE GRANTED RIGHTS TO SCICLONE TO DEVELOP, PROMOTE, MARKET, DISTRIBUTE AND SELL SGX942 IN DEFINED TERRITORIES.  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LICENSE AGREEMENT, SCICLONE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL ASPECTS OF DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCT REGISTRATION AND  COMMERCIALIZATION IN THE TERRITORIES, HAVING ACCESS TO DATA GENERATED BY US. IN EXCHANGE FOR EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS, SCICLONE WILL PAY  US ROYALTIES ON NET SALES, AND WE WILL SUPPLY COMMERCIAL DRUG PRODUCT TO SCICLONE ON A COST-PLUS BASIS, WHILE MAINTAINING WORLDWIDE  MANUFACTURING RIGHTS.  WE  HAVE RECEIVED CLEARANCE FROM THE FDA TO ADVANCE THE PIVOTAL PHASE 3 PROTOCOL FOR SGX942 IN THE TREATMENT OF ORAL MUCOSITIS IN  PATIENTS WITH HEAD AND NECK CANCER RECEIVING CHEMORADIATION THERAPY. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE RECEIVED POSITIVE SCIENTIFIC ADVICE  FROM THE EMA FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SGX942 AS A TREATMENT FOR ORAL MUCOSITIS IN PATIENTS WITH HEAD AND NECK CANCER. THE SCIENTIFIC  ADVICE FROM THE EMA INDICATES THAT A SINGLE, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, MULTINATIONAL, PHASE 3 PIVOTAL STUDY, IF SUCCESSFUL,  IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PHASE 2 DOSE-RANGING STUDY, IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT A MARKETING AUTHORIZATION APPLICATION  (\u201cMAA\u201d) TO THE EMA FOR POTENTIAL LICENSURE IN EUROPE. THE ADVICE ALSO PROVIDED SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE  STUDY DESIGN AND DATA COLLECTION THAT WERE INTEGRATED INTO THE FINAL PROTOCOL. SCIENTIFIC ADVICE IS OFFERED BY THE EMA TO STAKEHOLDERS  FOR CLARIFICATION OF QUESTIONS ARISING DURING DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS. THE SCOPE OF SCIENTIFIC ADVICE IS LIMITED TO  SCIENTIFIC ISSUES AND FOCUSES ON DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES RATHER THAN PRE-EVALUATION OF DATA TO SUPPORT AN MAA. SCIENTIFIC ADVICE  IS LEGALLY NON-BINDING AND IS BASED ON THE CURRENT SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE WHICH MAY BE SUBJECT TO FUTURE CHANGES.  WE  ARE WORKING WITH LEADING ONCOLOGY CENTERS, A NUMBER OF WHICH PARTICIPATED IN THE PHASE 2 STUDY, TO ADVANCE THIS PHASE 3 CLINICAL  TRIAL REFERRED TO AS THE \u201cDOM\u2013INNATE\u201d STUDY (  D  USQUETIDE TREATMENT IN  O  RAL  M  UCOSITIS \u2013  BY MODULATING  INNATE  IMMUNITY). BASED ON THE POSITIVE AND PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED PHASE 2 RESULTS (STUDY IDR-OM-01), THE PIVOTAL  PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL (STUDY IDR-OM-02) IS A HIGHLY POWERED, DOUBLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, MULTINATIONAL TRIAL  THAT WILL SEEK TO ENROLL APPROXIMATELY 190 SUBJECTS WITH SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA OF THE ORAL CAVITY AND OROPHARYNX WHO ARE SCHEDULED  TO RECEIVE A MINIMUM TOTAL CUMULATIVE RADIATION DOSE OF 55 GY FRACTIONATED AS 2.0-2.2 GY PER DAY WITH CONCOMITANT CISPLATIN CHEMOTHERAPY  GIVEN AS A DOSE OF 80-100 MG/M  2  EVERY THIRD WEEK. SUBJECTS ARE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE EITHER 1.5 MG/KG SGX942 OR PLACEBO  GIVEN TWICE A WEEK DURING AND FOR TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF CHEMORADIATION THERAPY (\u201cCRT\u201d). THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT  FOR THE STUDY IS THE MEDIAN DURATION OF SEVERE ORAL MUCOSITIS, WHICH IS ASSESSED BY ORAL EXAMINATION AT EACH TREATMENT VISIT AND  THEN THROUGH SIX WEEKS FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF CRT. ORAL MUCOSITIS IS EVALUATED USING THE WHO GRADING SYSTEM. SEVERE ORAL MUCOSITIS  IS DEFINED AS A WHO GRADE OF \u22653. SUBJECTS ARE FOLLOWED FOR AN ADDITIONAL 12 MONTHS AFTER THE COMPLETION OF TREATMENT.  DURING  JULY 2017, WE INITIATED OUR PIVOTAL PHASE 3 STUDY WITH A CONTROLLED ROLL-OUT OF U.S. STUDY SITES, FOLLOWED BY THE ADDITION OF  EUROPEAN CENTERS IN 2018. WE ANTICIPATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 50 U.S. AND EUROPEAN ONCOLOGY CENTERS WILL BE PARTICIPATING IN THIS  PIVOTAL PHASE 3 STUDY, AND THAT AN INTERIM ANALYSIS REPORT FROM AN INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE WILL BECOME AVAILABLE  IN SEPTEMBER 2019.  DURING  SEPTEMBER 2017, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL AND CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH (\u201cNIDCR\u201d), PART OF THE NIH, AWARDED US  A SBIR GRANT OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION OVER TWO YEARS TO SUPPORT THE CONDUCT OF OUR PHASE 3, MULTINATIONAL, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND,  PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDY EVALUATING SGX942 (DUSQUETIDE) AS A TREATMENT FOR SEVERE ORAL MUCOSITIS IN PATIENTS WITH HEAD AND NECK  CANCER RECEIVING CRT.  ON  APRIL 9, 2019, THE U.S. PATENT OFFICE ISSUED A NEW PATENT NO. 10,253,068 TITLED \u201cNOVEL PEPTIDES FOR TREATING AND PREVENTING  IMMUNE-RELATED DISORDERS, INCLUDING TREATING AND PREVENTING INFECTION BY MODULATING INNATE IMMUNITY\u201d FOR OUR DUSQUETIDE  RELATED ANALOGS.  IN  APRIL, 2019, THE PAEDIATRIC COMMITTEE OF THE EMA APPROVED OUR PAEDIATRIC INVESTIGATION PLAN (\u201cPIP\u201d) FOR SGX942, A  PREREQUISITE FOR FILING A MARKETING AUTHORIZATION APPLICATION (\u201cMAA\u201d) FOR ANY NEW MEDICINAL PRODUCT IN EUROPE. THE  EMA ALSO AGREED THAT WE MAY DEFER CONDUCTING THE PIP UNTIL SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF OUR ONGOING PIVOTAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL  OF SGX942, WHICH ALLOWS US TO FILE THE ADULT INDICATION MAA PRIOR TO COMPLETION OF THE PIP.  25  DURING  THE MONTH OF APRIL 2019, WE REACHED A SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE BY ENROLLING SUFFICIENT PATIENTS TO SUPPORT THE PLANNED INTERIM EFFICACY  ANALYSIS BY THE INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE (DMC).  WE  ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL WORLDWIDE MARKET FOR SGX942 IS IN EXCESS OF $500 MILLION FOR ALL APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THE TREATMENT  OF ORAL MUCOSITIS. THIS POTENTIAL MARKET INFORMATION IS A FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT, AND INVESTORS ARE URGED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE  RELIANCE ON THIS STATEMENT. WHILE WE HAVE DETERMINED THIS POTENTIAL MARKET SIZE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE,  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OUR EXPECTATIONS TO CHANGE OR NOT BE REALIZED.  ORAL  MUCOSITIS  MUCOSITIS  IS THE CLINICAL TERM FOR DAMAGE DONE TO THE MUCOSA BY ANTICANCER THERAPIES. IT CAN OCCUR IN ANY MUCOSAL REGION, BUT IS MOST COMMONLY  ASSOCIATED WITH THE MOUTH, FOLLOWED BY THE SMALL INTESTINE. WE ESTIMATE, BASED UPON OUR REVIEW OF HISTORIC STUDIES AND REPORTS,  AND AN INTERPOLATION OF DATA ON THE INCIDENCE OF MUCOSITIS, THAT MUCOSITIS AFFECTS APPROXIMATELY 500,000 PEOPLE IN THE U.S. PER  YEAR AND OCCURS IN 40% OF PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. MUCOSITIS CAN BE SEVERELY DEBILITATING AND CAN LEAD TO INFECTION, SEPSIS,  THE NEED FOR PARENTERAL NUTRITION AND NARCOTIC ANALGESIA. THE GI DAMAGE CAUSES SEVERE DIARRHEA. THESE SYMPTOMS CAN LIMIT THE DOSES  AND DURATION OF CANCER TREATMENT, LEADING TO SUB-OPTIMAL TREATMENT OUTCOMES.  THE  MECHANISMS OF MUCOSITIS HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED AND HAVE BEEN RECENTLY LINKED TO THE INTERACTION OF CHEMOTHERAPY AND/OR  RADIATION THERAPY WITH THE INNATE DEFENSE SYSTEM. BACTERIAL INFECTION OF THE ULCERATIVE LESIONS IS REGARDED AS A SECONDARY CONSEQUENCE  OF DYSREGULATED LOCAL INFLAMMATION TRIGGERED BY THERAPY-INDUCED CELL DEATH, RATHER THAN AS THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE LESIONS.  WE  ESTIMATE, BASED UPON OUR REVIEW OF HISTORIC STUDIES AND REPORTS, AND AN INTERPOLATION OF DATA ON THE INCIDENCE OF ORAL MUCOSITIS,  THAT ORAL MUCOSITIS IS A SUBPOPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 90,000 PATIENTS IN THE U.S., WITH A COMPARABLE NUMBER IN EUROPE. ORAL  MUCOSITIS ALMOST ALWAYS OCCURS IN PATIENTS WITH HEAD AND NECK CANCER TREATED WITH RADIATION THERAPY (GREATER THAN 80% INCIDENCE  OF SEVERE MUCOSITIS) AND IS COMMON IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING HIGH DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY AND HEMATOPOIETIC CELL TRANSPLANTATION, WHERE  THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF ORAL MUCOSITIS DEPENDS GREATLY ON THE NATURE OF THE CONDITIONING REGIMEN USED FOR MYELOABLATION.  ORAL  BDP  ORAL  BDP (BECLOMETHASONE 17,21-DIPROPIONATE) REPRESENTS A FIRST  -  OF  -  ITS  -  KIND ORAL, LOCALLY ACTING THERAPY TAILORED  TO TREAT GI INFLAMMATION. BDP HAS BEEN MARKETED IN THE U.S. AND WORLDWIDE SINCE THE EARLY 1970S AS THE ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT  IN A NASAL SPRAY AND IN A METERED-DOSE INHALER FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND ASTHMA. ORAL BDP IS SPECIFICALLY  FORMULATED FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION AS A SINGLE PRODUCT CONSISTING OF TWO TABLETS. ONE TABLET IS INTENDED TO RELEASE BDP IN THE  UPPER SECTIONS OF THE GI TRACT AND THE OTHER TABLET IS INTENDED TO RELEASE BDP IN THE LOWER SECTIONS OF THE GI TRACT.  BASED  ON ITS PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS, ORAL BDP MAY HAVE UTILITY IN TREATING OTHER CONDITIONS OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT HAVING  AN INFLAMMATORY COMPONENT. WE ARE PLANNING TO PURSUE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FOR THE TREATMENT OF PEDIATRIC CROHN\u2019S DISEASE,  ACUTE RADIATION ENTERITIS AND GI ARS PENDING FURTHER GRANT FUNDING. WE ARE ALSO EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY OF TESTING ORAL BDP  FOR LOCAL INFLAMMATION ASSOCIATED WITH ULCERATIVE COLITIS, AMONG OTHER INDICATIONS.  WE  ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL WORLDWIDE MARKET FOR ORAL BDP IS IN EXCESS OF $500 MILLION FOR ALL APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THE TREATMENT  OF PEDIATRIC CROHN\u2019S DISEASE. THIS POTENTIAL MARKET INFORMATION IS A FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT, AND INVESTORS ARE URGED  NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THIS STATEMENT. WHILE WE HAVE DETERMINED THIS POTENTIAL MARKET SIZE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE  BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OUR EXPECTATIONS TO CHANGE OR NOT BE REALIZED.  26  SGX203  \u2013 FOR TREATING PEDIATRIC CROHN\u2019S DISEASE  SGX203  IS A TWO TABLET DELIVERY SYSTEM OF BDP SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR ORAL USE THAT ALLOWS FOR ADMINISTRATION OF IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED  RELEASE BDP THROUGHOUT THE SMALL BOWEL AND THE COLON. THE FDA HAS GIVEN SGX203 ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION AS WELL AS FAST TRACK DESIGNATION  FOR THE TREATMENT OF PEDIATRIC CROHN\u2019S DISEASE. WE WILL PURSUE A PIVOTAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL OF SGX203 FOR THE TREATMENT  OF PEDIATRIC CROHN\u2019S DISEASE CONTINGENT UPON ADDITIONAL FUNDING, SUCH AS THROUGH PARTNERSHIP FUNDING SUPPORT.  PEDIATRIC  CROHN\u2019S DISEASE  CROHN\u2019S  DISEASE CAUSES INFLAMMATION OF THE GI TRACT. CROHN\u2019S DISEASE CAN AFFECT ANY AREA OF THE GI TRACT, FROM THE MOUTH TO THE  ANUS, BUT IT MOST COMMONLY AFFECTS THE LOWER PART OF THE SMALL INTESTINE, CALLED THE ILEUM. THE SWELLING CAUSED BY THE DISEASE  EXTENDS DEEP INTO THE LINING OF THE AFFECTED ORGAN. THE SWELLING CAN INDUCE PAIN AND CAN MAKE THE INTESTINES EMPTY FREQUENTLY,  RESULTING IN DIARRHEA. BECAUSE THE SYMPTOMS OF CROHN\u2019S DISEASE ARE SIMILAR TO OTHER INTESTINAL DISORDERS, SUCH AS IRRITABLE  BOWEL SYNDROME AND ULCERATIVE COLITIS, IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE. PEOPLE OF ASHKENAZI JEWISH HERITAGE HAVE AN INCREASED  RISK OF DEVELOPING CROHN\u2019S DISEASE.  CROHN\u2019S  DISEASE CAN APPEAR AT ANY AGE, BUT IT IS MOST OFTEN DIAGNOSED IN ADULTS IN THEIR 20S AND 30S. HOWEVER, APPROXIMATELY 30% OF PEOPLE  WITH CROHN\u2019S DISEASE DEVELOP SYMPTOMS BEFORE 20 YEARS OF AGE. WE ESTIMATE, BASED UPON OUR REVIEW OF HISTORIC PUBLISHED STUDIES  AND REPORTS, AND AN INTERPOLATION OF DATA ON THE INCIDENCE OF PEDIATRIC CROHN\u2019S DISEASE, THAT PEDIATRIC CROHN\u2019S DISEASE  IS A SUBPOPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 80,000 PATIENTS IN THE U.S. WITH A COMPARABLE NUMBER IN EUROPE. CROHN\u2019S DISEASE TENDS  TO BE BOTH SEVERE AND EXTENSIVE IN THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION AND A RELATIVELY HIGH PROPORTION (APPROXIMATELY 40%) OF PEDIATRIC  CROHN\u2019S PATIENTS HAVE INVOLVEMENT OF THEIR UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT.  CROHN\u2019S  DISEASE PRESENTS SPECIAL CHALLENGES FOR CHILDREN AND TEENS. IN ADDITION TO BOTHERSOME AND OFTEN PAINFUL SYMPTOMS, THE DISEASE  CAN STUNT GROWTH, DELAY PUBERTY, AND WEAKEN BONES. CROHN\u2019S DISEASE SYMPTOMS MAY SOMETIMES PREVENT A CHILD FROM PARTICIPATING  IN ENJOYABLE ACTIVITIES. THE EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES OF LIVING WITH A CHRONIC DISEASE CAN BE ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT FOR  YOUNG PEOPLE.  SGX201  \u2013 FOR PREVENTING ACUTE RADIATION ENTERITIS  SGX201  IS A DELAYED-RELEASE FORMULATION OF BDP SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR ORAL USE. IN 2012, WE COMPLETED A PHASE 1/2 CLINICAL TRIAL TESTING  SGX201 IN PREVENTION OF ACUTE RADIATION ENTERITIS. PATIENTS WITH RECTAL CANCER SCHEDULED TO UNDERGO CONCURRENT RADIATION AND CHEMOTHERAPY  PRIOR TO SURGERY WERE RANDOMIZED TO ONE OF FOUR DOSE GROUPS. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY WERE TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY AND MAXIMAL  TOLERATED DOSE OF ESCALATING DOSES OF SGX201, AS WELL AS THE PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF SGX201 FOR PREVENTION OF SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS  OF ACUTE RADIATION ENTERITIS. THE STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF SGX201 WAS SAFE AND WELL TOLERATED ACROSS ALL  FOUR DOSE GROUPS. THERE WAS ALSO EVIDENCE OF A POTENTIAL DOSE RESPONSE WITH RESPECT TO DIARRHEA, NAUSEA AND VOMITING AND THE ASSESSMENT  OF ENTERITIS ACCORDING TO NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE COMMON TERMINOLOGY CRITERIA FOR ADVERSE EVENTS FOR SELECTED GASTROINTESTINAL  EVENTS. IN ADDITION, THE INCIDENCE OF DIARRHEA WAS LOWER THAN THAT SEEN IN RECENT PUBLISHED HISTORICAL CONTROL DATA IN THIS PATIENT  POPULATION. THIS PROGRAM WAS SUPPORTED IN PART BY A $500,000 TWO-YEAR SBIR GRANT AWARDED BY THE NIH. WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH  OUR RADIATION ENTERITIS MEDICAL ADVISORS TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.  WE  HAVE RECEIVED FAST TRACK DESIGNATION FROM THE FDA FOR SGX201 FOR ACUTE RADIATION ENTERITIS.  ACUTE  RADIATION ENTERITIS  EXTERNAL  RADIATION THERAPY IS USED TO TREAT MOST TYPES OF CANCER, INCLUDING CANCER OF THE BLADDER, UTERINE, CERVIX, RECTUM, PROSTATE, AND  VAGINA. DURING DELIVERY OF TREATMENT, SOME LEVEL OF RADIATION WILL ALSO BE DELIVERED TO HEALTHY TISSUE, INCLUDING THE BOWEL, LEADING  TO ACUTE AND CHRONIC TOXICITIES. THE LARGE AND SMALL BOWELS ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO RADIATION AND THE LARGER THE DOSE OF RADIATION  THE GREATER THE DAMAGE TO NORMAL BOWEL TISSUE. RADIATION ENTERITIS IS A CONDITION IN WHICH THE LINING OF THE BOWEL BECOMES SWOLLEN  AND INFLAMED DURING OR AFTER RADIATION THERAPY TO THE ABDOMEN, PELVIS, OR RECTUM. MOST TUMORS IN THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS NEED LARGE  DOSES, AND ALMOST ALL PATIENTS RECEIVING RADIATION TO THE ABDOMEN, PELVIS, OR RECTUM WILL SHOW SIGNS OF ACUTE ENTERITIS.  27  PATIENTS  WITH ACUTE ENTERITIS MAY HAVE NAUSEA, VOMITING, ABDOMINAL PAIN AND BLEEDING, AMONG OTHER SYMPTOMS. SOME PATIENTS MAY DEVELOP DEHYDRATION  AND REQUIRE HOSPITALIZATION. WITH DIARRHEA, THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT DOES NOT FUNCTION NORMALLY, AND NUTRIENTS SUCH AS FAT,  LACTOSE, BILE SALTS, AND VITAMIN B12 ARE NOT WELL ABSORBED.  SYMPTOMS  WILL USUALLY RESOLVE WITHIN TWO TO SIX WEEKS AFTER THERAPY HAS CEASED. RADIATION ENTERITIS IS OFTEN NOT A SELF-LIMITED ILLNESS,  AS OVER 80% OF PATIENTS WHO RECEIVE ABDOMINAL RADIATION THERAPY COMPLAIN OF A PERSISTENT CHANGE IN BOWEL HABITS. MOREOVER, ACUTE  RADIATION INJURY INCREASES THE RISK OF DEVELOPMENT OF CHRONIC RADIATION ENTEROPATHY, AND OVERALL 5% TO 15% OF THE PATIENTS WHO  RECEIVE ABDOMINAL OR PELVIC IRRADIATION WILL DEVELOP CHRONIC RADIATION ENTERITIS.  WE  ESTIMATE, BASED UPON OUR REVIEW OF HISTORIC PUBLISHED STUDIES AND REPORTS, AND AN INTERPOLATION OF DATA ON THE TREATMENT COURSES  AND INCIDENCE OF CANCERS OCCURRING IN THE ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC REGIONS, THERE TO BE OVER 100,000 PATIENTS ANNUALLY IN THE U.S.,  WITH A COMPARABLE NUMBER IN EUROPE, WHO RECEIVE ABDOMINAL OR PELVIC EXTERNAL BEAM RADIATION TREATMENT FOR CANCER, AND THESE PATIENTS  ARE AT RISK OF DEVELOPING ACUTE AND CHRONIC RADIATION ENTERITIS.  PUBLIC  HEALTH SOLUTIONS OVERVIEW  THERMOVAX  \u00ae  \u2013 THERMOSTABILITY TECHNOLOGY  THERMOVAX  \u00ae  IS A NOVEL METHOD OF RENDERING ALUMINUM SALT, (KNOWN COLLOQUIALLY AS ALUM), ADJUVANTED VACCINES STABLE AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES.  ALUM IS THE MOST WIDELY EMPLOYED ADJUVANT TECHNOLOGY IN THE VACCINE INDUSTRY. THE VALUE OF THERMOVAX  \u00ae  LIES IN ITS  POTENTIAL ABILITY TO ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR COLD CHAIN PRODUCTION, TRANSPORTATION, AND STORAGE FOR ALUM ADJUVANTED VACCINES. THIS  WOULD RELIEVE THE HIGH COSTS OF PRODUCING AND MAINTAINING VACCINES UNDER REFRIGERATED CONDITIONS. BASED ON HISTORICAL REPORTS  FROM THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND OTHER SCIENTIFIC REPORTS, WE BELIEVE THAT A MEANINGFUL PROPORTION OF VACCINE DOSES GLOBALLY  ARE WASTED DUE TO EXCURSIONS FROM REQUIRED COLD CHAIN TEMPERATURE RANGES. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT MOST ALUM ADJUVANTED VACCINES  NEED TO BE MAINTAINED AT BETWEEN 2 AND 8 DEGREES CELSIUS (\u201cC\u201d) AND EVEN BRIEF EXCURSIONS FROM THIS TEMPERATURE RANGE  (ESPECIALLY BELOW FREEZING) USUALLY NECESSITATES THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PRODUCT OR THE INITIATION OF COSTLY STABILITY PROGRAMS  SPECIFIC FOR THE VACCINE LOTS IN QUESTION. THERMOVAX  \u00ae  HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FACILITATE EASIER STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION  OF STRATEGIC NATIONAL STOCKPILE VACCINES FOR RICIN EXPOSURE IN EMERGENCY SETTINGS.  THERMOVAX  \u00ae  DEVELOPMENT WAS SUPPORTED PURSUANT TO OUR $9.4 MILLION NIAID GRANT ENABLING  DEVELOPMENT OF THERMO-STABLE RICIN (RIVAX  \u00ae  ) AND ANTHRAX VACCINES. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PRECLINICAL STUDIES WITH THERMOVAX  \u00ae  INDICATE THAT IT IS ABLE TO PRODUCE STABLE VACCINE FORMULATIONS USING ADJUVANTS, PROTEIN IMMUNOGENS, AND OTHER COMPONENTS THAT  ORDINARILY WOULD NOT WITHSTAND LONG TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS EXCEEDING CUSTOMARY REFRIGERATED STORAGE CONDITIONS. THESE STUDIES WERE  CONDUCTED WITH OUR ALUMINUM-ADJUVANTED RICIN TOXIN VACCINE, RIVAX  \u00ae  AND OUR ALUMINUM-ADJUVANTED ANTHRAX VACCINE.  EACH VACCINE WAS MANUFACTURED UNDER PRECISE LYOPHILIZATION CONDITIONS USING EXCIPIENTS THAT AID IN MAINTAINING NATIVE PROTEIN STRUCTURE  OF THE KEY ANTIGEN. WHEN RIVAX  \u00ae  WAS KEPT AT 40 DEGREES C (104 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT) FOR UP TO ONE YEAR, ALL OF THE  ANIMALS VACCINATED WITH THE LYOPHILIZED RIVAX  \u00ae  VACCINE DEVELOPED POTENT AND HIGH TITER NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES.  IN CONTRAST, ANIMALS THAT WERE VACCINATED WITH THE LIQUID RIVAX  \u00ae  VACCINE KEPT AT 40 DEGREES C DID NOT DEVELOP NEUTRALIZING  ANTIBODIES AND WERE NOT PROTECTED AGAINST RICIN EXPOSURE. THE RICIN A CHAIN IS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE AND RAPIDLY LOSES  THE ABILITY TO INDUCE NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES WHEN EXPOSED TO TEMPERATURES HIGHER THAN 8 DEGREES C. WHEN THE ANTHRAX VACCINE WAS  KEPT FOR UP TO 16 WEEKS AT 70 DEGREES C, IT WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP A POTENT ANTIBODY RESPONSE, UNLIKE THE LIQUID FORMULATION KEPT  AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE. MOREOVER, WE ALSO HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE COMPATIBILITY OF OUR THERMOSTABILIZATION TECHNOLOGY WITH OTHER  SECONDARY ADJUVANTS SUCH AS TLR-4 AGONISTS.  28  WE  ALSO ENTERED INTO A COLLABORATION AGREEMENT WITH AXEL LEHRER, PHD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TROPICAL MEDICINE, MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY  AND PHARMACOLOGY, JOHN A. BURNS SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI  \u02bb  I  AT MANOA (\u201cUH MANOA\u201d) AND HAWAII BIOTECH, INC. (\u201cHBI\u201d) TO DEVELOP A HEAT STABLE SUBUNIT EBOLA VACCINE.  DR. LEHRER, A CO-INVENTOR OF THE EBOLA VACCINE WITH HBI, HAS SHOWN PROOF OF CONCEPT EFFICACY WITH SUBUNIT EBOLA VACCINES IN NON-HUMAN  PRIMATES. THE MOST ADVANCED EBOLA VACCINES INVOLVE THE USE OF VESICULAR STOMATITIS VIRUS AND ADENOVIRUS VECTORS \u2013 LIVE,  VIRAL VECTORS WHICH COMPLICATE THE MANUFACTURING, STABILITY AND STORAGE REQUIREMENTS. DR. LEHRER\u2019S VACCINE CANDIDATE IS  BASED ON HIGHLY PURIFIED RECOMBINANT PROTEIN ANTIGENS, CIRCUMVENTING MANY OF THESE MANUFACTURING DIFFICULTIES. DR. LEHRER AND  HBI HAVE DEVELOPED A ROBUST MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR THE REQUIRED PROTEINS. APPLICATION OF THERMOVAX  \u00ae  MAY ALLOW  FOR A PRODUCT THAT CAN AVOID THE NEED FOR COLD CHAIN DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE, YIELDING A VACCINE IDEAL FOR USE IN BOTH THE DEVELOPED  AND DEVELOPING WORLD. THIS AGREEMENT HAS EXPIRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS TERMS.  ON  DECEMBER 21, 2010, WE EXECUTED A WORLDWIDE EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO (\u201cUC\u201d) FOR  CERTAIN PATENTS RELATING TO THERMOVAX  \u00ae  IN ALL FIELDS OF USE. IN APRIL 2018, THE UC DELIVERED A NOTICE OF TERMINATION  OF OUR LICENSE AGREEMENT BASED UPON OUR FAILURE TO ACHIEVE ONE OF THE DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES: INITIATION OF THE PHASE 1 CLINICAL  TRIAL OF THE HEAT STABILIZATION TECHNOLOGY BY MARCH 31, 2018. AFTER NEGOTIATING WITH THE UC, WE AND THE UC AGREED TO EXTEND THE  TERMINATION DATE TO OCTOBER 31, 2018 IN ORDER TO ALLOW US TIME TO AGREE UPON A POTENTIAL AGREEMENT THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO KEEP  THE RIGHTS TO, AND TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP, THE HEAT STABILIZATION TECHNOLOGY OR A PRODUCT CANDIDATE CONTAINING THE HEAT STABILIZATION  TECHNOLOGY IN OUR FIELD OF USE.  ON  OCTOBER 31, 2018, IN A SERIES OF RELATED TRANSACTIONS, (A) WE AND THE UC AGREED TO TERMINATE THE ORIGINAL LICENSE AGREEMENT, (B)  THE UC AND VITRIVAX, INC. (\u201cVITRIVAX\u201d) EXECUTED A WORLDWIDE EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR THE HEAT STABILIZATION  TECHNOLOGY FOR ALL FIELDS OF USE, AND (C) WE AND VITRIVAX EXECUTED A WORLDWIDE EXCLUSIVE SUBLICENSE AGREEMENT FOR THE HEAT STABILIZATION  TECHNOLOGY FOR USE IN THE FIELDS OF RICIN AND EBOLA VACCINES. WE PAID A $100,000 SUBLICENSE FEE ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE SUBLICENSE  AGREEMENT. TO MAINTAIN THE SUBLICENSE WE ARE OBLIGED TO PAY A MINIMUM ANNUAL ROYALTY OF $20,000 UNTIL FIRST COMMERCIAL SALE OF  A SUBLICENSED PRODUCT, UPON WHICH POINT, WE SHALL PAY AN EARNED ROYALTY OF 2% OF NET SALES SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM ROYALTY OF $50,000  EACH YEAR. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO PAY ROYALTY ON ANY SUB-SUBLICENSE INCOME BASED ON A DECLINING PERCENTAGE OF ALL SUB-SUBLICENSE  INCOME CALCULATED WITHIN THE CONTRACTUAL PERIOD UNTIL REACHING A MINIMUM OF 15% AFTER TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED  TO PAY VITRIVAX MILESTONE FEES OF: (A) $50,000 UPON INITIATION OF A PHASE II CLINICAL TRIAL OF THE SUBLICENSED PRODUCT, (B) $200,000  UPON REGULATORY APPROVAL OF A SUBLICENSED PRODUCT, AND (C) $1 MILLION UPON ACHIEVING $10 MILLION IN AGGREGATE NET SALES OF A SUBLICENSED  PRODUCT IN THE U.S. OR EQUIVALENT. TO DATE NONE OF THESE MILESTONES HAVE BEEN MET.  DURING  SEPTEMBER 2017, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WOULD BE PARTICIPATING IN A NIAID RESEARCH PROJECT (R01) GRANT AWARDED TO UH MANOA FOR THE  DEVELOPMENT OF A TRIVALENT THERMOSTABILIZED EBOLA VACCINE, WITH OUR AWARDED FUNDING OF APPROXIMATELY $700,000 OVER FIVE YEARS.  PREVIOUS COLLABORATIONS DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF DEVELOPING A HEAT STABLE SUBUNIT EBOLA VACCINE. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE  SUBAWARD, WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT VACCINE FORMULATION DEVELOPMENT WITH OUR PROPRIETARY VACCINE THERMOSTABILIZATION TECHNOLOGY,  THERMOVAX  \u00ae  . ULTIMATELY, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PRODUCE A THERMOSTABLE TRIVALENT FILOVIRUS VACCINE FOR PROTECTION AGAINST  EBOLA AND RELATED DISEASES, ALLOWING WORLDWIDE DISTRIBUTION WITHOUT THE NEED FOR COLD STORAGE.  ON FEBRUARY 7, 2019, EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS AND BIOPHARMACEUTICS PUBLISHED A SCIENTIFIC ARTICLE  DEMONSTRATING THE SUCCESSFUL THERMOSTABILIZATION OF AN EBOLA SUBUNIT VACCINE CANDIDATE.  29  RIVAX  \u00ae  \u2013  RICIN TOXIN VACCINE  RIVAX  \u00ae  IS OUR PROPRIETARY VACCINE CANDIDATE BEING DEVELOPED TO PROTECT AGAINST EXPOSURE TO RICIN TOXIN AND IF APPROVED, WOULD BE  THE FIRST RICIN VACCINE. THE IMMUNOGEN IN RIVAX  \u00ae  INDUCES A PROTECTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE IN ANIMAL MODELS OF RICIN  EXPOSURE AND FUNCTIONALLY ACTIVE ANTIBODIES IN HUMANS. THE IMMUNOGEN CONSISTS OF A GENETICALLY INACTIVATED RICIN A CHAIN SUBUNIT  THAT IS ENZYMATICALLY INACTIVE AND LACKS RESIDUAL TOXICITY OF THE HOLOTOXIN. RIVAX  \u00ae  HAS DEMONSTRATED STATISTICALLY  SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.0001) PRECLINICAL SURVIVAL RESULTS, PROVIDING 100% PROTECTION AGAINST ACUTE LETHALITY IN AN AEROSOL EXPOSURE  NON-HUMAN PRIMATE MODEL (ROY ET AL, 2015, THERMOSTABLE RICIN VACCINE PROTECTS RHESUS MACAQUES AGAINST AEROSOLIZED RICIN: EPITOPE-SPECIFIC  NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES CORRELATE WITH PROTECTION, PNAS USA 112:3782-3787), AND HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO BE WELL TOLERATED AND IMMUNOGENIC  IN TWO PHASE 1 CLINICAL TRIALS IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. RESULTS OF THE FIRST PHASE 1 HUMAN TRIAL OF RIVAX  \u00ae  ESTABLISHED  THAT THE IMMUNOGEN WAS SAFE AND INDUCED ANTIBODIES THAT WE BELIEVE MAY PROTECT HUMANS FROM RICIN EXPOSURE. THE ANTIBODIES GENERATED  FROM VACCINATION, CONCENTRATED AND PURIFIED, WERE CAPABLE OF CONFERRING IMMUNITY PASSIVELY TO RECIPIENT ANIMALS, INDICATING THAT  THE VACCINE WAS CAPABLE OF INDUCING FUNCTIONALLY ACTIVE ANTIBODIES IN HUMANS. THE OUTCOME OF THIS STUDY WAS PUBLISHED IN THE PROCEEDINGS  OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES (VITETTA ET AL., 2006, A PILOT CLINICAL TRIAL OF A RECOMBINANT RICIN VACCINE IN NORMAL HUMANS,  PNAS, 103:2268-2273). THE SECOND TRIAL WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN SEPTEMBER 2012 AND WAS SPONSORED BY UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SOUTHWESTERN  MEDICAL CENTER (\u201cUTSW\u201d), EVALUATED A MORE POTENT FORMULATION OF RIVAX  \u00ae  THAT CONTAINED AN ALUMINUM ADJUVANT  (ALUM). THE RESULTS OF THE PHASE 1B STUDY INDICATED THAT ALUM-ADJUVANTED RIVAX  \u00ae  WAS SAFE AND WELL TOLERATED, AND  INDUCED GREATER RICIN NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY LEVELS IN HUMANS THAN ADJUVANT-FREE RIVAX  \u00ae  . THE OUTCOMES OF THIS SECOND  STUDY WERE PUBLISHED IN THE CLINICAL AND VACCINE IMMUNOLOGY (VITETTA ET AL., 2012, RECOMBINANT RICIN VACCINE PHASE 1B CLINICAL  TRIAL, CLIN. VACCINE IMMUNOL. 10:1697-1699). WE HAVE ADAPTED THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURING PROCESS FOR THE IMMUNOGEN CONTAINED IN  RIVAX  \u00ae  FOR THERMOSTABILITY AND LARGE SCALE MANUFACTURING AND RECENT STUDIES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THE THERMOSTABILIZED  RIVAX  \u00ae  FORMULATION ENHANCES THE STABILITY OF THE RIVAX  \u00ae  ANTIGEN, ENABLING STORAGE FOR AT LEAST 1  YEAR AT TEMPERATURES UP TO 40\u00b0C (104 \u00b0F). THE PROGRAM WILL PURSUE APPROVAL VIA THE FDA \u201cANIMAL RULE\u201d SINCE  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF THE VACCINE IN A CLINICAL STUDY WHICH WOULD EXPOSE HUMANS TO RICIN. UNIFORM, EASILY  MEASURED AND SPECIES-NEUTRAL IMMUNE CORRELATES OF PROTECTION THAT CAN BE MEASURED IN HUMANS AND ANIMALS, AND ARE INDICATIVE OF  ANIMAL SURVIVAL TO SUBSEQUENT RICIN CHALLENGE, ARE CENTRAL TO THE APPLICATION OF THE \u201cANIMAL RULE\u201d. RECENT WORK HAS  IDENTIFIED SUCH POTENTIAL CORRELATES OF IMMUNE PROTECTION IN ANIMALS AND WORK TO QUALIFY AND VALIDATE THESE APPROACHES IS CONTINUING,  WITH THE GOAL OF UTILIZING THESE ASSAYS IN A PLANNED PHASE 1/2 CLINICAL TRIAL WITH THE THERMOSTABLE RIVAX  \u00ae  FORMULATION.  DURING SEPTEMBER 2018, WE PUBLISHED AN EXTENDED STABILITY STUDY OF RIVAX  \u00ae  , SHOWING UP TO 100% PROTECTION IN MICE  AFTER 12 MONTHS STORAGE AT 40\u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) AS WELL AS IDENTIFICATION OF A POTENTIAL IN VITRO STABILITY INDICATING ASSAY,  CRITICAL TO ADEQUATELY CONFIRMING THE LONG-TERM SHELF LIFE OF THE VACCINE. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A COLLABORATION WITH IDT BIOLOGIKA  GMBH TO SCALE-UP THE FORMULATION/FILLING PROCESS AND CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF ANALYTICAL METHODS ESTABLISHED AT  IDT TO ADVANCE THE PROGRAM. WE ALSO HAVE INITIATED A DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH EMERGENT BIOSOLUTIONS, INC. TO IMPLEMENT A COMMERCIALLY  VIABLE, SCALABLE PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY FOR THE RIVAX  \u00ae  DRUG SUBSTANCE PROTEIN ANTIGEN.  THE  DEVELOPMENT OF RIVAX  \u00ae  HAS BEEN SPONSORED THROUGH A SERIES OF OVERLAPPING CHALLENGE GRANTS, UC1, AND COOPERATIVE  GRANTS, U01, FROM THE NIH, GRANTED TO US AND TO UTSW WHERE THE VACCINE ORIGINATED. THE SECOND CLINICAL TRIAL WAS SUPPORTED BY  A GRANT FROM THE FDA\u2019S OFFICE OF ORPHAN PRODUCTS TO UTSW. TO DATE, WE AND UTSW HAVE COLLECTIVELY RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY  $25 MILLION IN GRANT FUNDING FROM THE NIH FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF RIVAX  \u00ae  . IN SEPTEMBER 2014, WE ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT  WITH THE NIH FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF RIVAX  \u00ae  THAT WOULD PROVIDE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $24.7 MILLION OF FUNDING IN THE  AGGREGATE IF OPTIONS TO EXTEND THE CONTRACT ARE EXERCISED BY THE NIH. THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS WITH EMERGENT BIOSOLUTIONS AND  IDT ARE SPECIFICALLY FUNDED UNDER THIS NIH CONTRACT.  DURING  JUNE 2017 NIAID EXERCISED AN OPTION FOR THE EVALUATION OF RIVAX  \u00ae  TO FUND ADDITIONAL ANIMAL EFFICACY STUDIES. THE  EXERCISED OPTION WILL PROVIDE US WITH APPROXIMATELY $2.0 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING. ADDITIONALLY, DURING AUGUST 2017 NIAID  EXERCISED AN OPTION TO FUND GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES COMPLIANT RIVAX  \u00ae  BULK DRUG SUBSTANCE AND FINISHED DRUG  PRODUCT MANUFACTURING, WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR THE CONDUCT OF FUTURE PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL SAFETY AND EFFICACY STUDIES. THE EXERCISED  OPTION WILL PROVIDE US WITH APPROXIMATELY $2.5 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL NON-DILUTIVE FUNDING, BRINGING THE TOTAL AMOUNT AWARDED TO  DATE UNDER THIS CONTRACT TO $21.2 MILLION, OF WHICH $13.5 MILLION IS STILL AVAILABLE. IF ALL CONTRACT OPTIONS ARE EXERCISED, THE  TOTAL AWARD OF UP TO $24.7 MILLION WILL SUPPORT THE PRECLINICAL, MANUFACTURING AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES NECESSARY TO  ADVANCE HEAT STABLE RIVAX  \u00ae  WITH THE FDA. IN ADDITION TO THE ONGOING FUNDING OF UP TO $24.7 MILLION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT  OF RIVAX  \u00ae  , BIOMARKERS FOR RIVAX  \u00ae  TESTING HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFIED, FACILITATING POTENTIAL  APPROVAL UNDER THE FDA ANIMAL RULE.  RIVAX  \u00ae  HAS BEEN GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION BY THE FDA FOR THE PREVENTION OF RICIN INTOXICATION. IN ADDITION, RIVAX  \u00ae  HAS ALSO BEEN GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION IN THE EU FROM THE EMA COMMITTEE FOR ORPHAN MEDICAL PRODUCTS.  30  ASSUMING  DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE SUCCESSFUL FOR RIVAX  \u00ae  , WE BELIEVE POTENTIAL GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT CONTRACT(S) COULD  REACH AS MUCH AS $200 MILLION. THIS POTENTIAL PROCUREMENT CONTRACT INFORMATION IS A FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT, AND INVESTORS ARE  URGED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THIS STATEMENT. WHILE WE HAVE DETERMINED THIS POTENTIAL PROCUREMENT CONTRACT VALUE BASED  ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OUR EXPECTATIONS TO CHANGE OR NOT  BE REALIZED.  AS  A NEW CHEMICAL ENTITY, AN FDA APPROVED RIVAX  \u00ae  VACCINE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO QUALIFY FOR A BIODEFENSE PRIORITY REVIEW  VOUCHER (\u201cPRV\u201d). APPROVED UNDER THE 21ST CENTURY CURES ACT IN LATE 2016, THE BIODEFENSE PRV IS AWARDED UPON APPROVAL  AS A MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURE WHEN THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT(S) HAVE NOT BEEN OTHERWISE APPROVED FOR USE IN ANY CONTEXT. PRVS ARE TRANSFERABLE  AND CAN BE SOLD, WITH SALES IN RECENT YEARS IN EXCESS OF $100 MILLION. WHEN REDEEMED, PRVS ENTITLE THE USER TO AN ACCELERATED  REVIEW PERIOD OF NINE MONTHS, SAVING A MEDIAN OF SEVEN MONTHS REVIEW TIME AS CALCULATED IN 2009. HOWEVER, FDA MUST BE ADVISED  90 DAYS IN ADVANCE OF THE USE OF THE PRV AND THE USE OF A PRV IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN ADDITIONAL USER FEE ($2.7 MILLION IN 2017).  RICIN  TOXIN  RICIN  TOXIN CAN BE CHEAPLY AND EASILY PRODUCED, IS STABLE OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME, IS TOXIC BY SEVERAL ROUTES OF EXPOSURE AND THUS  HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE USED AS A BIOLOGICAL WEAPON AGAINST MILITARY AND/OR CIVILIAN TARGETS. AS A BIOTERRORISM AGENT, RICIN COULD  BE DISSEMINATED AS AN AEROSOL, BY INJECTION, OR AS A FOOD SUPPLY CONTAMINANT. THE POTENTIAL USE OF RICIN TOXIN AS A BIOLOGICAL  WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION HAS BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IN A FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION BIOTERROR REPORT RELEASED IN NOVEMBER 2007  TITLED TERRORISM 2002-2005, WHICH STATES THAT \u201cRICIN AND THE BACTERIAL AGENT ANTHRAX ARE EMERGING AS THE MOST PREVALENT  AGENTS INVOLVED IN WMD INVESTIGATIONS\u201d (HTTP://WWW.FBI.GOV/STATS-SERVICES/PUBLICATIONS/TERRORISM-2002-2005/TERROR02_05.PDF).  IN RECENT YEARS, AL QAEDA IN THE ARABIAN PENINSULA HAS THREATENED THE USE OF RICIN TOXIN TO POISON FOOD AND WATER SUPPLIES AND  IN CONNECTION WITH EXPLOSIVE DEVICES. DOMESTICALLY, THE THREAT FROM RICIN REMAINS A CONCERN FOR SECURITY AGENCIES. IN APRIL 2013,  LETTERS ADDRESSED TO THE U.S. PRESIDENT, A SENATOR AND A JUDGE TESTED POSITIVE FOR RICIN. AS RECENTLY AS OCTOBER 2018, AN ENVELOPE  ADDRESSED TO PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS SUSPECTED TO CONTAIN THIS POTENT AND POTENTIALLY LETHAL TOXIN, WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CONFIRMED  TO CONTAIN PIECES OF CASTOR BEANS USED TO MAKE RICIN.  THE  CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION HAS CLASSIFIED RICIN TOXIN AS A CATEGORY B BIOLOGICAL AGENT. RICIN WORKS BY FIRST BINDING  TO GLYCOPROTEINS FOUND ON THE EXTERIOR OF A CELL, AND THEN ENTERING THE CELL AND INHIBITING PROTEIN SYNTHESIS LEADING TO CELL  DEATH. ONCE EXPOSED TO RICIN TOXIN, THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE THERAPY AVAILABLE TO REVERSE THE COURSE OF THE TOXIN. THE RECENT RICIN  THREAT TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAS HEIGHTENED THE AWARENESS OF THIS TOXIC THREAT. CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO FDA APPROVED VACCINE  TO PROTECT AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF RICIN TOXIN BEING USED IN A TERRORIST ATTACK, OR ITS USE AS A WEAPON ON THE BATTLEFIELD  NOR IS THERE A KNOWN ANTIDOTE FOR RICIN TOXIN EXPOSURE.  SGX943  \u2013 FOR TREATING EMERGING AND/OR ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT INFECTIOUS DISEASES  SGX943  IS AN IDR, CONTAINING THE SAME ACTIVE INGREDIENT AS SGX942. DUSQUETIDE IS A FULLY SYNTHETIC, 5-AMINO ACID PEPTIDE WITH HIGH AQUEOUS  SOLUBILITY AND STABILITY. EXTENSIVE  IN VIVO  PRECLINICAL STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED ENHANCED CLEARANCE OF BACTERIAL INFECTION  WITH SGX943 ADMINISTRATION. SGX943 HAS SHOWN EFFICACY AGAINST BOTH GRAM-NEGATIVE AND GRAM-POSITIVE BACTERIAL INFECTIONS IN PRECLINICAL  MODELS, INDEPENDENT OF WHETHER THE BACTERIA IS ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT OR ANTIBIOTIC-SENSITIVE.  THE  INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RAPID AND NON-SPECIFIC RESPONSES TO COMBAT BACTERIAL INFECTION. AUGMENTING THESE RESPONSES  REPRESENTS AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO TREATING BACTERIAL INFECTIONS. IN ANIMAL MODELS, IDRS ARE EFFICACIOUS AGAINST BOTH ANTIBIOTIC-SENSITIVE  AND ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT INFECTIONS, BOTH GRAM-POSITIVE AND GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA, AND ARE ACTIVE IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THE  BACTERIA OCCUPIES A PRIMARILY EXTRACELLULAR OR INTRACELLULAR NICHE. IDRS ARE ALSO EFFECTIVE AS STAND-ALONE AGENTS OR IN CONJUNCTION  WITH ANTIBIOTICS. AN IDR FOR THE TREATMENT OF SERIOUS BACTERIAL INFECTIONS ENCOMPASSES A NUMBER OF CLINICAL ADVANTAGES INCLUDING.  \u25cf  TREATMENT  WHEN ANTIBIOTICS ARE CONTRAINDICATED, SUCH AS.  O  BEFORE  THE INFECTIOUS ORGANISM AND/OR ITS ANTIBIOTIC SUSCEPTIBILITY IS KNOWN; OR  O  IN  AT-RISK POPULATIONS PRIOR TO INFECTION.  31  \u25cf  AN  ABILITY TO BE USED AS AN ADDITIVE, COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT WITH ANTIBIOTICS, THEREBY.  O  ENHANCING  EFFICACY OF SUB-OPTIMAL ANTIBIOTIC REGIMENS (E.G., PARTIALLY ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT INFECTIONS);  O  ENHANCING  CLEARANCE OF INFECTION, THEREBY MINIMIZING THE GENERATION OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE; AND  O  REDUCING  THE REQUIRED ANTIBIOTIC DOSE, AGAIN POTENTIALLY MINIMIZING THE GENERATION OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE.  \u25cf  AN  ABILITY TO MODULATE THE DELETERIOUS CONSEQUENCES OF INFLAMMATION IN RESPONSE TO THE INFECTION, INCLUDING THE INFLAMMATION  CAUSED BY ANTIBIOTIC-DRIVEN BACTERIAL LYSIS; AND  \u25cf  BEING  UNLIKELY TO GENERATE BACTERIAL RESISTANCE SINCE THE IDR ACTS ON THE HOST, AND NOT THE PATHOGEN.  IMPORTANTLY,  SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION AND MULTI-ORGAN FAILURE IS THE ULTIMATE COMMON OUTCOME OF NOT ONLY EMERGING AND/OR ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT  INFECTIOUS DISEASES, BUT ALSO OF MOST BIOTHREAT AGENTS (E.G.,  BURKHOLDERIA PSEUDOMALLEI  ), INDICATING THAT DUSQUETIDE WOULD  BE APPLICABLE NOT ONLY TO ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT INFECTION, BUT ALSO TO BIOTHREAT AGENTS, ESPECIALLY WHERE THE PATHOGEN IS NOT KNOWN  AND/OR HAS BEEN ENGINEERED FOR ENHANCED ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE.  IN  MAY 2019, THE COMPANY WAS AWARDED A SUBCONTRACT OF APPROXIMATELY $600,000 OVER THREE YEARS TO PARTICIPATE IN A BIODEFENSE CONTRACT  FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURES AGAINST BACTERIAL THREAT AGENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THERE WAS NO REVENUE EARNED OR EXPENSE INCURRED RELATED TO THE DTRA SUBCONTRACT.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES, AND  RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE EVALUATE THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON AN ON-GOING BASIS.  REVENUE  RECOGNITION  OUR  REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY GENERATED FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND GRANTS. THE REVENUE FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND GRANTS IS BASED  UPON SUBCONTRACTOR COSTS AND INTERNAL COSTS INCURRED THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY COVERED BY THE CONTRACTS AND GRANTS, PLUS A FACILITIES  AND ADMINISTRATIVE RATE THAT PROVIDES FUNDING FOR OVERHEAD EXPENSES AND MANAGEMENT FEES. THESE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN EXPENSES  HAVE BEEN INCURRED BY SUBCONTRACTORS OR WHEN WE INCUR INTERNAL EXPENSES THAT ARE RELATED TO THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND GRANTS.  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE WHEN INCURRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB ASC 730,  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  . RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT INCLUDES COSTS SUCH AS CLINICAL TRIAL EXPENSES, CONTRACTED RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENT FEES WITH NO ALTERNATIVE  FUTURE USE, SUPPLIES AND MATERIALS, SALARIES, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, EQUIPMENT DEPRECIATION AND ALLOCATION  OF VARIOUS CORPORATE COSTS. PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE REPRESENTS THE VALUE ASSIGNED OR PAID FOR ACQUIRED  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR WHICH THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE AS OF THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.  SHARE-BASED  COMPENSATION  STOCK  OPTIONS ARE ISSUED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE MARKET PRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT. STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED TO DIRECTORS UPON  RE-ELECTION VEST QUARTERLY FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR (NEW DIRECTOR ISSUANCES ARE FULLY VESTED UPON ISSUANCE). STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED  TO EMPLOYEES GENERALLY VEST 25% ON THE GRANT DATE, THEN 25% EACH SUBSEQUENT YEAR FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS. STOCK OPTIONS VEST  OVER EACH THREE-MONTH PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE TO THE END OF THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD. THESE OPTIONS HAVE A TEN YEAR LIFE  FOR AS LONG AS THE INDIVIDUALS REMAIN EMPLOYEES OR DIRECTORS. IN GENERAL, WHEN AN EMPLOYEE OR DIRECTOR TERMINATES THEIR POSITION  THE OPTIONS WILL EXPIRE WITHIN THREE MONTHS, UNLESS OTHERWISE EXTENDED BY THE BOARD.  FROM  TIME TO TIME, WE ISSUE RESTRICTED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO VENDORS AND CONSULTANTS AS COMPENSATION FOR SERVICES PERFORMED. TYPICALLY  THESE INSTRUMENTS VEST UPON ISSUANCE AND THEREFORE THE ENTIRE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED UPON ISSUANCE TO  THE VENDORS AND/OR CONSULTANTS.  32  IN  JUNE 2018, THE FASB AMENDED THE ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ISSUED TO NONEMPLOYEES IN ASU 2018-07. UNDER THE REVISED  GUIDANCE, THE SCOPE OF TOPIC 718 WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS ISSUED TO NONEMPLOYEES, SUPERSEDES SUBTOPIC 505-50  AND GENERALLY ALIGNS THE ACCOUNTING FOR AWARDS ISSUED TO NONEMPLOYEES TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE AWARDS. THE COMPANY ADOPTED  THE NEW GUIDANCE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEW GUIDANCE, STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR EQUITY-CLASSIFIED  AWARDS TO NONEMPLOYEES IS MEASURED ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.  THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION GRANT MADE DURING  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018 WAS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF EACH GRANT USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL  AND AMORTIZED RATABLY OVER THE OPTION VESTING PERIODS, WHICH APPROXIMATES THE SERVICE PERIOD. THE FAIR VALUE OF RESTRICTED SHARES  OF COMMON STOCK ISSUED TO THE THIRD-PARTY VENDORS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS MEASURED AT THE MARKET PRICE OF  THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS RECOGNIZED ON THE DATE OF GRANT SINCE THE  SERVICE HAD BEEN RENDERED AND ALL OTHER CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR THE AWARD HAD BEEN SATISFIED. THE COMPANY DID NOT ISSUE SHARES  OF COMMON STOCK TO THIRD PARTY VENDORS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  INCOME  TAXES  DEFERRED  TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT  CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASIS. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED WHEN  IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT ALL OR A PORTION OF A DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED. A REVIEW OF ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE  AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE IS CONSIDERED, INCLUDING OUR CURRENT AND PAST PERFORMANCE, THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE, THE  UTILIZATION OF PAST TAX CREDITS, AND THE LENGTH OF CARRYBACK AND CARRYFORWARD PERIODS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE  MEASURED UTILIZING TAX RATES EXPECTED TO APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED  TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED. WE RECOGNIZED AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $610,676 FROM THE SALE OF THE NEW JERSEY NOL CARRYFORWARD DURING  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. NO INCOME TAX BENEFIT WAS RECOGNIZED FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. WE RECOGNIZE  ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, IF ANY, AS PART OF THE INCOME TAX PROVISION. THERE WERE  NO TAX RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RECORDED FOR JUNE 30, 2019 OR 2018. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE NOT RECORDED AN ASSET FOR UNRECOGNIZED  TAX BENEFITS OR A LIABILITY FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AT JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018.  EARNINGS  PER SHARE  BASIC  EARNINGS PER SHARE (\u201cEPS\u201d) EXCLUDES DILUTION AND IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME (LOSS) AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS  BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD. DILUTED EPS REFLECTS THE POTENTIAL DILUTION THAT COULD  OCCUR IF SECURITIES OR OTHER CONTRACTS TO ISSUE COMMON STOCK WERE EXERCISED OR CONVERTED INTO COMMON STOCK OR RESULTED IN THE  ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK THAT SHARED IN THE EARNINGS OF THE ENTITY. SINCE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OPTIONS AND WARRANTS  OUTSTANDING, FLUCTUATIONS IN THE ACTUAL MARKET PRICE CAN HAVE A VARIETY OF RESULTS FOR EACH PERIOD PRESENTED.  USE  OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS  THE  PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. REQUIRES MANAGEMENT  TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS THE FAIR VALUE OF WARRANTS AND STOCK OPTIONS AND RECOVERY OF THE USEFUL LIFE OF INTANGIBLES  THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  33  MATERIAL  CHANGES IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE  AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO JUNE 30, 2018  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019,  WE HAD A NET LOSS OF $2,123,521 AS COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $1,556,342 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REPRESENTING AN  INCREASE OF $567,179 OR 36%. THE INCREASE IN THE QUARTERLY LOSS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER CLINICAL TRIAL EXPENSES INCURRED IN  2019 TO SUPPORT THE PIVOTAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL OF SGX301 FOR THE TREATMENT OF CTCL AND THE PIVOTAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL OF  SGX942 FOR THE TREATMENT OF ORAL MUCOSITIS IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD A NET LOSS OF  $3,763,148 AS COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $3,933,548 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REPRESENTING A DECREASE IN THE NET LOSS  OF $170,400 OR 4%. THIS DECREASE IN YEAR-TO-DATE NET LOSS WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE $610,676 INCOME TAX BENEFIT FROM THE  SALE OF THE NEW JERSEY 2017 NOL CARRYFORWARDS AND $251,212 MILESTONE FEE INCOME FROM THE RIVAX  \u00ae  PROGRAM, OFFSET  BY HIGHER CLINICAL TRIAL EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FOR OUR TWO PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIALS OF SGX301  AND SGX942.  OUR REVENUES AND ASSOCIATED COSTS INCURRED  WERE RELATED TO THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND GRANTS AWARDED IN SUPPORT OF OUR PIVOTAL PHASE 3 TRIALS OF SGX301 AND SGX942 IN ADDITION  TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE THERMOVAX  \u00ae  AND RIVAX  \u00ae  PROGRAMS. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019,  WE HAD TOTAL REVENUE OF $1,544,964 AS COMPARED TO $1,725,545 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REPRESENTING A DECREASE OF  $180,581 OR 10%. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD TOTAL REVENUE OF $2,689,752 AS COMPARED TO $2,845,318 FOR THE SAME  PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, REPRESENTING A DECREASE OF $155,566 OR 5%. WE INCURRED COSTS RELATED TO THOSE REVENUES FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018 OF $1,086,814 AND $1,493,676, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING A DECREASE OF $406,862 OR 27%. FOR  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COSTS RELATED TO REVENUES WERE $2,014,738 AS COMPARED TO $2,472,597 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  THE PRIOR YEAR, REPRESENTING A DECREASE OF $457,859 OR 19%.

GROSS PROFIT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS $675,014 OR 25% OF REVENUES, AS COMPARED TO $372,721  OR 13% OF REVENUES FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $302,293 OR 81%. THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT DURING  THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE $251,212 MILESTONE FEE INCOME EARNED IN JUNE 2019  FROM THE RIVAX  \u00ae  PROGRAM AND A HIGHER SHARE OF REIMBURSABLE COSTS AVAILABLE FOR CONTRACTED FIXED OVERHEAD REIMBURSEMENT  IN 2019, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE OF 16% AND 12%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE THREE MONTHS AND SIX MONTHS  ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 OVER THE COMPARABLE PERIODS IN 2018.  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE $1,853,950 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $1,170,333 FOR THE SAME  PERIOD IN 2018, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $683,617 OR 58%.

THE INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER PROFESSIONAL FEES INCURRED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  OTHER INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019 WAS $41,370 AS COMPARED TO $32,948 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $8,422 OR 26%.

THE INCREASES WERE DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST AND DIVIDEND RATES ON OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS FOR BOTH THE THREE  AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018.  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  CASH  AND WORKING CAPITAL  AS  OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $6,986,289 AS COMPARED TO $8,983,717 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018,  REPRESENTING A DECREASE OF $1,997,428 OR 22%.

THE  DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND WORKING CAPITAL WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO EXPENDITURES INCURRED TO SUPPORT THE  PIVOTAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL OF SGX301 FOR THE TREATMENT OF CTCL AND EXPENDITURES INCURRED IN THE PIVOTAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL  TRIAL OF SGX942 FOR THE TREATMENT OF ORAL MUCOSITIS IN HEAD AND NECK CANCER.  WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR LOSSES FOR THE  FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO SUPPORT ONGOING OPERATIONS. MANAGEMENT IS EVALUATING ALL OPTIONS  TO RAISE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

DR. SCHABER\u2019S AMENDED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT INCLUDES OUR OBLIGATION TO ISSUE SUCH SHARES IF SUCH EVENT  OCCURS.  IN MAY 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A  FOUR-MONTH SERVICE AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD PARTY VENDOR, WHICH REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO ISSUE AT PRE-DETERMINED INTERVALS AN AGGREGATE  OF 100,000 RESTRICTED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AS PARTIAL COMPENSATION FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED.

WE BELIEVE THAT UNDERSTANDING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND THE NEEDS OF OUR MERCHANTS IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND, ULTIMATELY, THE MOST PROFITABLE MEANS TO ACCOMPLISH OUR MISSION AND CREATE LONG-TERM VALUE FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS.  WE DRIVE CLIENT GROWTH THROUGH OUR IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF GLOBAL TRANSACTIONAL SERVICES AND RELATED VALUE-ADDED SERVICE OFFERINGS WHICH SEPARATE US FROM THE COMPETITION.  OUR VISION IS TO SET THE STANDARD FOR MULTI-CHANNEL PAYMENTS ACCEPTANCE AND VALUE-ADDED SERVICE OFFERINGS WITH FOCUS ON THE CREATION OF A UNIFIED GLOBAL TRANSACTION ACCEPTANCE ECOSYSTEM. WE BELIEVE IN DISRUPTIVE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND, AS SUCH, WE HAVE DEVELOPED NETEVIA, OUR FUTURE-READY MULTI-CHANNEL PAYMENTS PLATFORM TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF VALUE-ADDED SOLUTIONS DESIGNED FOR EVERYDAY COMMERCE. MOVING FORWARD, WE BELIEVE EXCITING PROJECTS AND DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES LIKE BLOCKCHAIN, IOT, BIOMETRIC PAYMENTS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WILL PROVIDE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE PAYMENTS SOLUTIONS, WHICH WILL PROVIDE VALUE TO OUR CLIENTS.  IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS VISION, WE SEEK TO FURTHER DEVELOP SINGLE ON-BOARDING, GLOBAL TRANSACTION ACCEPTANCE ECOSYSTEM. MANIFESTING THIS VISION REQUIRES SCALING OUR DIRECT AND INDIRECT CONNECTIVITY TO MULTIPLE PAYMENT AND MOBILE NETWORKS INTERNATIONALLY. BY IMPLEMENTING THIS VISION, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CENTRALIZED, GLOBAL MULTI-CHANNEL TRANSACTIONAL PLATFORM TO OUR CLIENTS INTERNATIONALLY.  OUR STRATEGY  OUR STRATEGY IS TO CAPITALIZE ON CONSUMER APPETITE FOR DIGITAL PAYMENT METHODS, THE PERCEIVED MOVEMENT TOWARDS A CASHLESS SOCIETY. TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR BUSINESS, OUR STRATEGY IS TO FOCUS ON PROVIDING MERCHANTS WITH THE ABILITY TO PROCESS A VARIETY OF ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE CHANNELS. WE SEEK TO LEVERAGE THE ADOPTION OF AND TRANSITION TO CARD, ELECTRONIC AND DIGITAL-BASED PAYMENTS BY EXPANDING OUR MARKET SHARE THROUGH OUR DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND SERVICES INNOVATIONS. WE ALSO SEEK GROWTH THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS TO IMPROVE OUR OFFERINGS, SCALE AND GEOGRAPHY. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN AND LEVERAGE OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR PEOPLE TO INCREASE OUR PENETRATION IN EXISTING MARKETS.  KEY ELEMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY INCLUDE.  \u25cf  CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN OUR CORE TECHNOLOGY AND NEW TECHNOLOGY OFFERINGS;  \u25cf  ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE TO GROW IN COMMERCE AND PAYMENTS SEGMENTS;  \u25cf  GROW AND CONTROL DISTRIBUTION BY ADDING NEW MERCHANTS AND PARTNERS;  \u25cf  LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL ADVANTAGES THROUGHOUT OUR GLOBAL FOOTPRINT;  \u25cf  EXPANSION OF OUR CARDHOLDER AND SUBSCRIBER CUSTOMER BASE;  \u25cf  CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SEAMLESS MULTINATIONAL SOLUTIONS FOR OUR CLIENTS;  \u25cf  INCREASE MONETIZATION WHILE CREATING VALUE FOR OUR CLIENTS;  \u25cf  FOCUS ON CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT AND OPERATION EXCELLENCE; AND  \u25cf  PURSUE POTENTIAL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS OF, INVESTMENTS IN, AND ALLIANCES WITH COMPANIES THAT HAVE HIGH GROWTH POTENTIAL, SIGNIFICANT MARKET PRESENCE OR KEY TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES.  AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY, WE ENTERED INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 WITH BANK SPUTNIK (\u201cSPUTNIK\u201d), LOCATED IN RUSSIA, TO LAUNCH A TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A SUITE OF FRICTIONLESS PAYMENT ACCEPTANCE SERVICES FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND VALUE-ADDED PROVIDERS. THIS NEW PAYMENT PROCESSING CENTER WOULD INTEGRATE SPUTNIK\u2019S EXPERTISE IN ENABLING SECURE GLOBALLY INTER-OPERABLE FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS WITH OUR EXPERTISE IN DEVELOPING FRICTIONLESS VALUE-ADDED PAYMENT ACCEPTANCE SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THIS PAYMENT PROCESSING CENTER WAS EXPECTED TO ACCELERATE THE DELIVERY OF PAYMENT ACCEPTANCE SERVICES IN THIS MARKET, COMBINING BANKING SERVICES AND BILL PAYMENTS IN A MULTI-CHANNEL ENVIRONMENT. THIS JOINT VENTURE WITH SPUTNIK WAS SUBJECT TO APPROVAL OF THE SHAREHOLDERS OF SPUTNIK AND THE REGULATORS IN RUSSIA. SPUTNIK\u2019S SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED THE TRANSACTION; HOWEVER SPUTNIK, DID NOT OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL, AS THEY DECLINED BELOW THE REQUIRED PAID IN CAPITAL RESERVES. PAYONLINE CONTINUES TO BE COMMITTED TO THE PAYMENT PROCESSING CENTER BUSINESS PLAN. ACCORDINGLY, PAYONLINE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH EACH OF MOBI.MONEY CJSC (\u201cMOBI.MONEY\u201d), AND VTB BANK, BOTH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AS SPONSORING AND TRANSACTION CLEARING BANKS. THIS NEW ARRANGEMENT RECEIVED REGULATORY APPROVAL IN RUSSIA. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, PAYONLINE HAS ENTERED INTO A FINANCIAL SERVICES AGREEMENT FOR TRANSACTION CLEARING SERVICES WITH MOBI.MONEY AND AMENDED ITS AGREEMENT WITH VTB BANK, ALLOWING FOR GREATER SCALABILITY AND SPONSORSHIP OF PAYONLINE TO CARD BRANDS. CARD BRANDS HAVE INITIATED PROJECTS FOR REGISTRATION OF PAYONLINE AS A THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT PROCESSOR. FOLLOWING SUCCESSFUL REGISTRATION, PAYONLINE PLANS TO FURTHER IMPLEMENT DIRECT INTEGRATIONS WITH INTERNATIONAL PAYMENT NETWORKS (\u201cIPNS\u201d). IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ITS BUSINESS PLAN, PAYONLINE HAS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL INVESTORS FOR FINANCING A PROPOSED VENTURE. THE EXECUTIVE TEAM CONTINUES TO WORK DILIGENTLY TO SELECT THE MOST CAPABLE FINANCIAL PARTNER FOR THIS VENTURE.  WITH OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS, WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ACCOMMODATE EXPECTED REVENUE GROWTH. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE WILL ALLOW US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND INCREASED MARGIN AS WE GROW OUR PROCESSING VOLUME AND EXPAND TO OTHER GEOGRAPHICAL TERRITORIES.  MARKET OVERVIEW  THE FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY AND TRANSACTION PROCESSING INDUSTRY IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF TODAY\u2019S WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL STRUCTURE. THE INDUSTRY IS CONTINUALLY EVOLVING, DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. THE BENEFITS OF CARD-BASED PAYMENTS ALLOW MERCHANTS TO ACCESS A BROADER UNIVERSE OF CONSUMERS, ENJOY FASTER SETTLEMENT TIMES AND REDUCE TRANSACTION ERRORS. BY USING CREDIT OR DEBIT CARDS, CONSUMERS ARE ABLE TO MAKE PURCHASES MORE CONVENIENTLY, WHETHER IN PERSON, OVER THE INTERNET, OR BY MAIL, FAX OR TELEPHONE, WHILE GAINING THE BENEFIT OF LOYALTY PROGRAMS, SUCH AS FREQUENT FLYER MILES OR CASH BACK, WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY BEING OFFERED BY CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD ISSUERS.  IN ADDITION, CONSUMERS ARE ALSO BEGINNING TO USE CARD-BASED AND OTHER ELECTRONIC PAYMENT METHODS FOR PURCHASES AT AN EARLIER AGE IN LIFE, AND INCREASINGLY FOR SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNT PURCHASES. GIVEN THESE ADVANTAGES OF CARD-BASED PAYMENT SYSTEMS TO MERCHANTS AND CONSUMERS, FAVORABLE DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS, AND THE RESULTING PROLIFERATION OF CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD USAGE, WE BELIEVE BUSINESSES WILL INCREASINGLY SEEK TO ACCEPT CARD-BASED PAYMENT SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE BELIEVE THAT CASH TRANSACTIONS ARE BECOMING PROGRESSIVELY OBSOLETE. THE PROLIFERATION OF BANKCARDS HAS MADE THE ACCEPTANCE OF BANKCARD PAYMENTS A VIRTUAL NECESSITY FOR MANY BUSINESSES, REGARDLESS OF SIZE, IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. IN ADDITION, THE ADVENT AND GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE AND CRYPTO-CURRENCIES HAVE MARKED A SIGNIFICANT NEW TREND IN THE WAY BUSINESS IS BEING CONDUCTED. E-COMMERCE IS DEPENDENT UPON CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS, AS WELL AS OTHER CASHLESS PAYMENT PROCESSING METHODS.  THE PAYMENT PROCESSING INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE RAPIDLY, BASED ON THE APPLICATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND CHANGING CUSTOMER NEEDS. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO EVOLVE WITH THE MARKET TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES TO MEET THE EVER-CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR MARKET PLACE. TRADITIONAL PLAYERS IN THE INDUSTRY MUST QUICKLY ADAPT TO THE CHANGING ENVIRONMENT OR BE LEFT BEHIND IN THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE.  BUSINESS SEGMENTS  WE OPERATE TWO REPORTABLE BUSINESS OPERATING SEGMENTS: (I) NORTH AMERICAN TRANSACTION SOLUTIONS AND (II) INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION SOLUTIONS. OUR SEGMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO ESTABLISH LINES OF BUSINESSES THAT SUPPORT OUR CLIENT BASE AND FURTHER GLOBALIZE OUR SOLUTIONS. MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS BASED ON THE INTERNAL REPORTING USED BY OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE AND TO ASSESS WHERE TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES. THE PRINCIPAL REVENUE STREAM FOR ALL SEGMENTS COMES FROM SERVICE AND TRANSACTION RELATED FEES.  NORTH AMERICAN TRANSACTION SOLUTIONS  NORTH AMERICAN TRANSACTION SOLUTIONS IS CURRENTLY OUR LARGEST SEGMENT, WHERE THROUGH OUR SUBSIDIARY TOT PAYMENTS, LLC, DOING BUSINESS AS UNIFIED PAYMENTS, WE PROVIDE BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES AND TYPES WITH A WIDE RANGE OF FULLY-INTEGRATED PAYMENT ACCEPTANCE SOLUTIONS AT THE POINT OF SALE, INCLUDING MERCHANT ACQUIRING, E-COMMERCE, MOBILE COMMERCE, POS AND OTHER BUSINESS SOLUTIONS.

GEOGRAPHICAL PRESENCE FOR THIS SEGMENT IS NORTH AMERICA.

OUR PROPRIETARY SAAS SUITE OF SOLUTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC AND MOBILE COMMERCE GATEWAY AND PAYMENT PROCESSING PLATFORM IS COMPLIANT AT LEVEL 1 OF PCI DSS, STREAMLINES THE ORDER-TO-CASH PROCESS, IMPROVES ELECTRONIC PAYMENT ACCEPTANCE AND REDUCES THE SCOPE OF BURDEN OF PCI DSS COMPLIANCE.

OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES DELINEATED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS.  NON-CASH COMPENSATION.  NON-CASH COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.0 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $100,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE INCREASE IN EXPENSE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-CASH COMPENSATION OF SHARES AND STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED TO NAMED EXECUTIVES, CERTAIN EMPLOYEES, AND CERTAIN CONSULTANTS IN CONNECTION WITH EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARDS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  BAD DEBT EXPENSE ANALYSIS.  WE REFLECTED A BAD DEBT EXPENSE ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, WHICH REPRESENTS UNCOLLECTED FEES OF APPROXIMATELY $483,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $1.0 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $517,000 FROM THE PREVIOUS COMPARABLE PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE REQUIRED CLOSURE OF CERTAIN HIGH-RISK MERCHANTS FROM A THIRD-PARTY PLATFORM TO OUR OWN DESIGNATED BIN. THIS RESULTED IN A WRITE-OFF OF ACCOUNTS DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE APPROXIMATING $365,000. THE REMAINING DIFFERENCE OF APPROXIMATELY $152,000 WAS THE RESULT OF RECORDING OF THE ACTUAL UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS WHICH WERE DIFFERENT THAN THE ESTIMATES RECORDED IN PREVIOUS PERIODS. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, TOTAL GROSS ACH REJECTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $916,000 OF WHICH $433,000 WERE SUBSEQUENTLY COLLECTED. WE WERE ABLE TO PASS THROUGH TO ISOS,VIA A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS, $167,000 FROM THE TOTAL GROSS ACH REJECTS.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THE AMORTIZATION OF MERCHANT PORTFOLIOS IN CONNECTION WITH RESIDUAL BUYOUT ARRANGEMENTS AND CLIENT ACQUISITION COSTS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $1.4 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AMORTIZATION OF THE RESIDUAL BUYOUT ARRANGEMENTS ACQUIRED DURING 2018 AND AN INCREASE IN CLIENT ACQUISITION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW MERCHANTS BOARDED.  INTEREST EXPENSE.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 IS AS FOLLOWS;  FUNDING SOURCE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  INCREASE /  (DECREASE)  MBF NOTES  $-  $10,359  $(10,359  )  RBL NOTES  468,703  322,654  146,049  PPS NOTE  -  113,867  (113,867  )  OTHER  28,932  32,096  (3,164  )  TOTAL  $497,635  $478,976  $18,659  INTEREST EXPENSE REMAINED STEADY PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PAYOFFS TO THE PRIORITY PAYMENTS NOTE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, AND THE REFINANCING OF THE RBL NOTES.  OTHER INCOME.  OTHER INCOME INCREASED FROM APPROXIMATELY $323,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 TO APPROXIMATELY $1.2 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO US RECOGNIZING OTHER INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 MILLION RELATING TO MERCHANT RESERVES RECORDED IN A PREVIOUS YEAR DEEMED NOT TO BE AN OBLIGATION AT JUNE 30, 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  TOTAL ASSETS AT JUNE 30, 2019 WERE APPROXIMATELY $23.3 MILLION COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $25.8 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE NET DECREASE IN TOTAL ASSETS WAS THE RESULT OF CASH UTILIZED TO FUND OPERATIONS AND PAY DOWN NOTES PAYABLE, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR RECORDING OF THE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET FOR OUR NORTH AMERICAN TRANSACTIONS U.S. HEADQUARTERS OPERATING FACILITY AS A RESULT OF OUR ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD.  AT JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY $6.9 MILLION AND APPROXIMATELY $9.7 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE DECREASE IN CURRENT ASSETS WAS THE UTILIZATION OF CASH ON HAND TO FUND OPERATIONS AND TO PAY EXPENSES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT WE WILL REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY $3.6 MILLION TO FINANCE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS.  TO FUND OUR OPERATING CASH NEEDS, WE MAY NEED TO BORROW ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FROM OUR CURRENT CREDIT FACILITIES OR ADDITIONAL SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE CAPITAL MARKETS FOR SOURCES OF FUNDING, WHICH COULD TAKE THE FORM OF ADDITIONAL DEBT, THE RESTRUCTURING OF OUR CURRENT DEBT, OR ADDITIONAL EQUITY FINANCING. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN RESTRUCTURING ITS CURRENT DEBT FACILITIES WITH COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TERMS THAT ENSURES THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF ITS BUSINESS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $10.1 MILLION IN AVAILABLE CREDIT FACILITIES.  ADDITIONAL FUNDS MAY BE RAISED THROUGH DEBT FINANCING AND/OR THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, THERE BEING NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY TYPE OF FINANCING ON TERMS SATISFACTORY TO US WILL BE AVAILABLE OR OTHERWISE OCCUR. DEBT FINANCING MUST BE REPAID REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE GENERATE REVENUES OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND MAY BE SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS. ANY EQUITY FINANCING OR DEBT FINANCING THAT REQUIRES THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES OR WARRANTS TO THE LENDER WOULD CAUSE THE PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP BY OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS TO BE DILUTED, WHICH DILUTION MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL. ALSO, ANY ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES ISSUED MAY HAVE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES OR PRIVILEGES SENIOR TO THOSE OF EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. IF SUCH FINANCINGS ARE NOT AVAILABLE WHEN REQUIRED OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLANS OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR PROSPECTS.  THE NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET ELEMENT, INC. STOCKHOLDERS WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $900,000 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  THE NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET ELEMENT, INC. STOCKHOLDERS WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.7 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $2.5 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES USED APPROXIMATELY $600,000 OF CASH FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $2.9 MILLION OF CASH USED FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH USED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO APPROXIMATELY $2.1 MILLION USED TO REDUCE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES USED APPROXIMATELY $1.7 MILLION IN CASH FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $900,000 USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE INCREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RECORDING OF AN OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE LIABILITY AND CLIENT ACQUISITION COSTS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION IN CASH FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $1.0 MILLION OF CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF RECORDING OF AN OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND PROCEEDS FROM A NOTE WITH RBL CAPITAL GROUP, LLC. CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDING JUNE 30, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REPAYMENT OF INDEBTEDNESS.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AT JUNE 30, 2019, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4) OF REGULATION S-K.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Net Element, Inc.", "CIK": 1499961, "Date": "2019-08-14T00:00:00", "Ticker": "NETE", "Name": "Net Element Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 7374.0, "Business": "FL", "Incorporated": "E9", "IRS": null, "key": "20190814NETE", "labelr1": -6.666666666666665, "labelr2": 1.8633540372670687, "labelr3": -4.5731707317073145, "labelr4": 0.6389776357827481, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.3650983, "prof1": 0.6349017, "return1&2": 0.9507246376811592, "return1&2&3": 0.907246376811594, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9130434782608696, "return2": 1.0186335403726707, "return1": 0.9333333333333332, "return3": 0.9542682926829268, "return4": 1.0063897763578276, "1_day_return": -6.666666666666665, "cumulative_return1": 0.3730509933038863, "cumulative_return1&2": 3.415780599030213, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 26.44943919715505, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 753.099957723495, "indexx": 2219, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9703054104492286, "cumreturn1b": 0.8373594422934056, "cumreturndow": 0.9641246634964737, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9622309958633618}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2309, "level_0": 2368, "index": 84613, "text": "ITEM 2  .

WE DELIVER A COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES INTO THE GLOBAL MARKET THAT ENABLE CUSTOMERS OF ALL SIZES TO POWER MISSION-CRITICAL WEB, CLOUD AND MOBILE INITIATIVES THAT ULTIMATELY DELIVER HIGH-VALUE TO THEIR BOTTOM LINE. OUR OFFERING CONSISTS OF A ROBUST FRAMEWORK FOR PERSONALIZATION AND SELF-SERVICE, MODULAR APPLICATIONS AND AGILE TOOLSETS THAT CUSTOMERS USE TO CREATE E-COMMERCE, PORTAL SOLUTIONS, ENTERPRISE SOCIAL NETWORKS (ESN), AND COLLABORATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. MOST RECENTLY, WE HAVE ADDED MOBILE AND CLOUD CAPABILITIES TO OUR PLATFORMS TO ENABLE RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF ROBUST, SECURE, AND SCALABLE SOLUTIONS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.  \ufeff  OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FURTHER OUR POSITION AS A GLOBAL SUPPLIER OF INNOVATIVE E-BUSINESS SOLUTIONS WITH THE ADDITION OF ENTERPRISE COLLABORATION AND ENGAGEMENT SOLUTIONS SUCH AS OUR MOBILE AND CLOUD-BASED VMOSO, A COLLABORATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT PRODUCT, AND CLEARVALE, AN ESN PRODUCT.  TOGETHER WITH OUR LEGACY BUSINESS AGILITY SUITE, COMMERCE AGILITY SUITE AND QUICKSILVER SOLUTIONS, OUR NEW ENTERPRISE COLLABORATION AND ENGAGEMENT SOLUTIONS ARE DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE COMMUNICATION, COLLABORATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES OF ORGANIZATIONS WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS, PARTNERS AND EMPLOYEES TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY. IN 2017, WE ANNOUNCED A MAJOR INCREMENTAL RELEASE OF OUR VMOSO PLATFORM WITH A RANGE OF NEW FUNCTIONALITY ACROSS SEVERAL KEY MODULES.  \ufeff  WE GENERATE REVENUES FROM FEES FOR LICENSES OR ACCESS AND USE OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND RELATED MAINTENANCE, CONSULTING SERVICES AND CUSTOMER TRAINING. WE GENERALLY CHARGE FEES FOR LICENSES OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS BASED ON (1) THE NUMBER OF PERSONS REGISTERED TO USE THE PRODUCT; OR (2) THE NUMBER OF CPUS UTILIZED BY THE MACHINES ON WHICH THE PRODUCT IS INSTALLED. WE ALSO CHARGE FEES FOR ACCESS AND USE OF CLOUD OR SAAS SOLUTIONS. PAYMENT TERMS ARE GENERALLY 30 TO 60 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT THE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE DELIVERED, THE MAINTENANCE OR SUBSCRIPTION CONTRACTS ARE BOOKED, OR THE CONSULTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED.  \ufeff  WE HAVE NOT GENERATED NET INCOME SINCE 2009. OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE PROFITS OR POSITIVE CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS REMAINS UNCERTAIN.  \ufeff  OUR OPERATIONS FACE TWO KEY CHALLENGES: MATURITY OF OUR MAJOR REVENUE-GENERATING LEGACY PRODUCTS, AND COMPETING IN A CROWDED ESN SOLUTION SPACE. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST HEAVILY IN CLOUD-BASED, MOBILE, MESSAGING AND COLLABORATION TECHNOLOGIES, WHILE CONTINUING TO SUPPORT OUR LEGACY BASE. TOTAL REVENUES OF $2.0 MILLION, INCLUDING $405,000 FOR VMSO PRODUCTS, IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 DECLINED FROM TOTAL REVENUES OF $2.8 MILLION FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2018, WITH THE DECREASE MAINLY IN LEGACY REVENUE. WE EXPECT THAT THE DECLINE IN OUR LEGACY REVENUE, WHICH IS THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE MIX, WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE OUR OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNTIL A SIGNIFICANT INSTALLED BASE OF NEW PRODUCT REVENUES IS ESTABLISHED. WE ARE CONTINUING TO DILIGENTLY INVEST IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES IN THE MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS AND COLLABORATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SPACES.           18           RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  \ufeff  MYVMOSO NETWORK PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES  \ufeff  IN 2018, WE BEGAN WORKING ON INITIATIVES TO DEVELOP AND ADVANCE A NEW PLATFORM, MYVMOSO NETWORK (MVN), A PERSONAL DIGITAL HUB THAT WILL UTILIZE OUR VMOSO PLATFORM IN CONJUNCTION WITH BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO ACT AS A BANK FOR CONSUMERS\u2019 PERSONAL DATA, AS WELL AS PROVIDE SECURE, PERSONALIZED, PERSISTENT, SYMMETRICAL ENGAGEMENT CHANNELS BETWEEN CONSUMERS AND THE BUSINESSES WITH WHICH THEY HAVE RELATIONSHIPS. MVN IS BEING DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE SECURE STORAGE FOR IMPORTANT DATA SUCH AS HEALTH RECORDS, FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, PRODUCT PURCHASES AND WARRANTIES, SUCH THAT USERS CAN TRUST, UNIFY, MANAGE AND MONETIZE THEIR PERSONAL DATA. MVN IS BEING DESIGNED TO PROVIDE.  \ufeff  \u00b7  A PLACE FOR USERS TO COMMUNICATE WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY DEAL WITH ON THEIR TERMS;  \u00b7  A PLATFORM FOR BUSINESSES TO BUILD BLOCKCHAIN-ENABLED APPLICATIONS FOR CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT;  \u00b7  A WAY FOR USERS TO MONETIZE THEIR PERSONAL DATA BY ALLOWING THIRD PARTIES TO USE IT IN EXCHANGE FOR COMPENSATION;  \u00b7  A CONSENT AUDIT TRAIL FOR USERS TO KEEP TRACK OF WHO THEY HAVE ALLOWED TO ACCESS THEIR DATA, FOR WHAT PURPOSE AND FOR HOW LONG; AND  \u00b7  A TOOLKIT FOR EXERCISING DATA-RELATED DIGITAL RIGHTS.  \ufeff  MVN IS INTENDED TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS AT NO CHARGE, AND MVN USERS WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE COMPENSATION FOR VARIOUS ACTIONS IN THE FORM OF A NEW CRYPTOCURRENCY CALLED THE MY VMOSO TOKEN (MVT) OR POSSIBLY AN EXISTING CRYPTOCURRENCY. EXAMPLES OF THE TYPES OF ACTIONS THAT WOULD ENTITLE A USER TO RECEIVE CRYPTOCURRENCY TOKENS FROM THIRD PARTIES INCLUDE LOADING PERSONAL PROFILE INFORMATION, PURCHASING HISTORY AND OTHER PERSONAL DATA INTO THE NETWORK, ALLOWING A THIRD PARTY TO USE PERSONAL DATA FOR A SPECIFIED PURPOSE, AND RESPONDING TO A THIRD-PARTY PRODUCT OFFER OR SURVEY. COMPENSATION WOULD BE MADE THROUGH SMALL TRANSACTION FEES PAID BY THE THIRD PARTIES.  \ufeff  AS DISCUSSED BELOW, THE MVN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WAS TRANSFERRED TO VMSO IN JANUARY 2019. VMSO IS A CONSOLIDATED VIE INCLUDED IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \ufeff  VMSO FINANCING  \ufeff  IN JANUARY 2019, WE PURCHASED 745,000 SHARES OF VMSO\u2019S SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK IN EXCHANGE FOR OUR CONTRIBUTION TO VMSO OF ASSETS REPRESENTING ALL OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER ASSETS RELATING TO OUR CLEARVALE AND VMOSO PLATFORMS, INCLUDING THE CLEARVALE AND VMOSO PRODUCTS AND THE MVN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.

WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL PROVIDE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PERSONNEL, FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT REQUIRED FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF VMSO UNDER THE SERVICES AND FACILITIES AGREEMENT AND WILL BE REIMBURSED FOR SUCH SUPPORT ON A BASIS INTENDED TO COVER OUR COSTS. VMSO NOW HOLDS ALL OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER ASSETS RELATED TO OUR CLEARVALE AND VMOSO PLATFORMS, INCLUDING THE CURRENT CLEARVALE AND VMOSO PRODUCTS AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND THE MVN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.  \ufeff  SINCE WE CONTROL THE MANAGEMENT OF VMSO AND HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB THE LOSSES OF, AND RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM VMSO THROUGH THE SERVICES AND FACILITIES AGREEMENT, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE COMPANY AS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE VMSO VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY. WE HAVE THEREFORE CONSOLIDATED VMSO\u2019S FINANCIAL RESULTS WITH OURS.

AT JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $4.6 MILLION, INCLUDING $2.1 MILLION FOR VMSO. OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 INCREASED $2.0 MILLION COMPARED TO THE BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018. THIS INCREASE WAS MAINLY DUE TO OUR JANUARY 2019 VMSO FINANCING  . OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS MAY FLUCTUATE DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019 DUE TO VARIOUS RISKS AND  UNCERTAINTIES  , INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE RISKS DETAILED IN PART II, ITEM 1A TITLED \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d.  \ufeff  BASED ON OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PLAN, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND OPERATING RESOURCE EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. HOWEVER, WE COULD EXPERIENCE UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, DIFFICULTIES IN RETAINING CUSTOMERS AND/OR EMPLOYEES, OR OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD INCREASE OUR USE OF AVAILABLE CASH AND REQUIRE US TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FINANCING. WE MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING DUE TO THE FACTORS LISTED ABOVE OR IN ORDER TO SUPPORT A MORE RAPID EXPANSION, DEVELOP NEW OR ENHANCED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, ACQUIRE COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES OR RESPOND TO UNANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS.  \ufeff  OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS INCLUDING GROWTH OR DECLINE IN CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS, THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF SPENDING TO SUPPORT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS AND ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY, AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL EXPENSES GENERALLY. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED COST REDUCTION PLANS SINCE THE SECOND HALF OF 2017 TO REDUCE OUR CASH NEEDS AND REDUCED THE COST OF OUR OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION IN 2018. IN JANUARY 2019, WE COMPLETED THE VMSO FINANCING, PURSUANT TO WHICH VMSO RAISED $3 MILLION IN CASH FROM OUR AND VMSO\u2019S PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OUR LARGEST STOCKHOLDER, DR. CHEN, AND VMSO NOW HOLDS ALL OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER ASSETS RELATED TO OUR CLEARVALE AND VMOSO PLATFORMS, REDUCING OUR EXPOSURE TO FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION COST OF CLEARVALE, VMOSO AND MVN. HOWEVER, FURTHER COST REDUCTIONS MAY RESULT IN VOLUNTARY DEPARTURES OF HIGHLY SKILLED TECHNICAL AND MANAGERIAL PERSONNEL FROM OUR COMPANY, WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  WE EXPECT TO OPPORTUNISTICALLY SEEK TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH PRIVATE OR PUBLIC SALES OF SECURITIES, STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS, BANK DEBT, FINANCING UNDER LEASING ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHERWISE. IF ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE RAISED THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, THE PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP OF OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE REDUCED, STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL DILUTION OR ANY EQUITY SECURITIES WE SELL MAY HAVE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES OR PRIVILEGES SENIOR TO THOSE OF THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE EXPECT THAT OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS WOULD BE DIFFICULT, AT BEST. IF ADEQUATE FUNDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY OUR DEBTS AS THEY BECOME DUE, DEVELOP OUR PRODUCTS, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES OR RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES OR UNANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS CANNOT BE PREDICTED AT THIS TIME. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISH THESE PLANS AND SECURE SOURCES OF FINANCING AND/OR REDUCE COSTS AND ULTIMATELY ATTAIN PROFITABLE OPERATIONS.  \ufeff  THE FOLLOWING TABLE REPRESENTS OUR LIQUIDITY AT JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).  \ufeff  \ufeff  \ufeff                                                  \ufeff                                                  \ufeff          JUNE 30,          DECEMBER 31,  \ufeff          2019          2018  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS          $4,620                $2,574        WORKING CAPITAL          $3,090                $1,853        WORKING CAPITAL RATIO                  2.38                        1.98        \ufeff  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  \ufeff  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $1.0 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, AND WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A $1.8 MILLION  OPERATING  LOSS OFFSET BY NONCASH ITEMS AND CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

INSTEAD, THEY ARE BASED ONLY ON OUR CURRENT BELIEFS,  EXPECTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE FUTURE OF OUR BUSINESS, FUTURE PLANS AND STRATEGIES, PROJECTIONS, ANTICIPATED EVENTS  AND TRENDS, THE ECONOMY AND OTHER FUTURE CONDITIONS.

THE NET SALES SOFTNESS CONTINUED TO REFLECT THE OVERALL  LOWER CONSUMPTION IN THE DAIRY AND CULTURED DAIRY PRODUCT CATEGORIES. VERSUS PRIOR YEAR, THE DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER  VOLUMES OF OUR BRANDED DRINKABLE KEFIR AND CUPPED KEFIR AND SKYR SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREMENTAL VOLUME OF NEW ITEM  INTRODUCTIONS.  GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  WAS 24.0% DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE WAS 25.4% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECLINE VERSUS  THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF OPERATING LEVERAGE THAT ARISES FROM LOWER NET SALES RELATIVE TO FIXED  COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN VARIABLE COSTS. ADDITIONALLY, DEPRECIATION EXPENSE INCREASED REFLECTING THE CONTINUED  INVESTMENT IN MANUFACTURING IMPROVEMENTS.  19  SELLING EXPENSES  SELLING EXPENSES DECREASED BY $692 OR 20.5%  TO $2,691 DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $3,383 DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE DECREASE VERSUS PRIOR  YEAR, PRIMARILY REFLECTS A REDUCTION IN ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS WITH LOWER EFFICIENCY, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT COMPENSATION  SAVINGS FROM ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES MADE IN 2018, AND BROKER COMMISSIONS. SELLING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WERE 11.6%  DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 12.5% FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED  $98 OR 3.3% TO $2,898 DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $2,996 DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE DECREASE  IS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSE DUE TO ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES MADE IN 2018, AND LOWER LEGAL AND PROFESSIONAL  FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES FEDERAL,  STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES WAS $13 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO A PROVISION  FOR INCOME TAXES OF $90 DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE (ETR) FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS 9.9% COMPARED TO AN ETR OF 34.6% IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX  RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SEPARATE STATE TAX RATES, CHANGE IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE AND NON-DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSE AMOUNTS BEING  A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF PRE-TAX INCOME. DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE RECOGNIZED NON-DEDUCTIBLE COMPENSATION  EXPENSE RELATED TO EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARDS. THIS RESULTED IN A PERMANENT RATE EFFECT AND WAS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTIMATED FULL YEAR  TAX RATE.  SECTION 162(M) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE  CODE (THE \u201cCODE\u201d) LIMITS THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF COMPENSATION PAID TO CERTAIN OF OUR EXECUTIVES. UNDER THE TAX CUTS AND  JOBS ACT (THE \u201cACT\u201d) AMENDMENTS TO SECTION 162(M), NO TAX DEDUCTION IN TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017  IS ALLOWED FOR COMPENSATION PAID TO ANY COVERED EMPLOYEE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE TOTAL COMPENSATION FOR THAT COVERED EMPLOYEE EXCEEDS  $1,000,000 IN ANY TAXABLE YEAR. ALTHOUGH THE ACT ELIMINATED THE PRIOR TAX DEDUCTION UNDER SECTION 162(M) FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION, IT INCLUDED A TRANSITION RULE UNDER WHICH THE CHANGES TO SECTION 162(M) WILL NOT APPLY TO AWARDS MADE TO  OUR COVERED EMPLOYEES WHO HAD THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR 2015 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN PURSUANT TO WRITTEN BINDING CONTRACTS  IN EFFECT AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2017, AS LONG AS THOSE CONTRACTS HAVE NOT SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN MODIFIED IN ANY MATERIAL RESPECT. ACCORDINGLY,  SUBJECT TO FURTHER GUIDANCE FROM THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (\u201cIRS\u201d), WE EXPECT THAT PERFORMANCE-BASED  COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR EXECUTIVES UNDER OUR OMNIBUS PLAN WILL REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR THE SECTION 162(M) EXEMPTION IN 2019.  INCOME TAXES ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 10 IN  THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  DECREASED TO 24.8% DURING THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM 26.7% DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE LOWER GROSS PROFIT  PERCENTAGE PRIMARILY REFLECTS CATEGORY SALES SOFTNESS, THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF OPERATING LEVERAGE THAT ARISES FROM LOWER NET  SALES RELATIVE TO FIXED COSTS, AND INCREASED FREIGHT COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN VARIABLE COSTS.  21  SELLING EXPENSES  SELLING EXPENSES DECREASED BY $1,571 OR  21.2% TO $5,830 DURING THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $7,401 DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE DECREASED SELLING  EXPENSES PRIMARILY REFLECT THE REDUCTION IN ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS WITH LOWER EFFICIENCY, COMPENSATION SAVINGS FROM  ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES MADE IN 2018, AND BROKER COMMISSIONS. SELLING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WERE 12.2% DURING THE  SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 13.3% FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES FEDERAL,  STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES. BENEFIT FOR INCOME TAXES WAS $41 DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO A PROVISION  FOR INCOME TAXES OF $128 DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE (ETR) FOR  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS (7.2%) COMPARED TO AN ETR OF 34.8% IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SEPARATE STATE TAX RATES, CHANGE IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE AND NON-DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSE AMOUNTS BEING A HIGHER  PERCENTAGE OF PRE-TAX INCOME. DURING THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE RECOGNIZED NON-DEDUCTIBLE COMPENSATION EXPENSE  RELATED TO EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARDS. THIS RESULTED IN A PERMANENT RATE EFFECT AND WAS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTIMATED FULL YEAR TAX  RATE.  SECTION 162(M) OF THE CODE LIMITS THE DEDUCTIBILITY  OF COMPENSATION PAID TO CERTAIN OF OUR EXECUTIVES. UNDER THE ACT\u2019S AMENDMENTS TO SECTION 162(M), NO TAX DEDUCTION IN TAXABLE  YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017 IS ALLOWED FOR COMPENSATION PAID TO ANY COVERED EMPLOYEE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE TOTAL COMPENSATION  FOR THAT COVERED EMPLOYEE EXCEEDS $1,000,000 IN ANY TAXABLE YEAR. ALTHOUGH THE ACT ELIMINATED THE PRIOR TAX DEDUCTION UNDER SECTION  162(M) FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION, IT INCLUDED A TRANSITION RULE UNDER WHICH THE CHANGES TO SECTION 162(M) WILL  NOT APPLY TO AWARDS MADE TO OUR COVERED EMPLOYEES WHO HAD THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR 2015 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN PURSUANT  TO WRITTEN BINDING CONTRACTS IN EFFECT AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2017, AS LONG AS THOSE CONTRACTS HAVE NOT SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN MODIFIED IN  ANY MATERIAL RESPECT. ACCORDINGLY, SUBJECT TO FURTHER GUIDANCE FROM THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (\u201cIRS\u201d),  WE EXPECT THAT PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR EXECUTIVES UNDER OUR OMNIBUS PLAN WILL REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR THE SECTION  162(M) EXEMPTION IN 2019.  INCOME TAXES ARE  DISCUSSED IN NOTE 10 IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  NET (LOSS) INCOME  WE REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $(529) OR $(0.03)  PER BASIC AND DILUTED COMMON SHARE FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF $240 OR $0.02 PER BASIC  AND DILUTED COMMON SHARE IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR FORESEEABLE LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS THROUGH ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS; OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY; AND CASH AND CASH  EQUIVALENTS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCING STRATEGIES WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE US WITH THE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF VARIOUS OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY ARISE.  22  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH  LIFEWAY HAD A NET INCREASE IN CASH AND  CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $24 DURING THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO A NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  OF $1,346 IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE DRIVERS OF THE YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE ARE AS FOLLOWS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  WAS $2,008 DURING THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $2,109 IN THE  SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES REFLECTS LOWER NET INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CHANGE  IN WORKING CAPITAL.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $269 DURING THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $1,989 IN THE SAME PERIOD  IN 2018. THE LOWER LEVEL OF NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2019 REFLECTS LOWER CAPITAL SPENDING. CAPITAL SPENDING WAS  $290 DURING THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $2,024 IN 2018. OUR CAPITAL SPENDING IS FOCUSED IN THREE CORE  AREAS: GROWTH, COST REDUCTION, AND FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS. GROWTH CAPITAL SPENDING SUPPORTS NEW PRODUCT INNOVATION AND ENHANCEMENTS.  COST REDUCTION SPENDING SUPPORTS MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY, SAFETY AND PRODUCTIVITY.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $1,715 DURING THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $1,466 IN THE SAME  PERIOD IN 2018. WE UTILIZED PROCEEDS FROM OUR FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX REFUNDS TO REPAY $1,330 ON OUR REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. ON NOVEMBER 1, 2017, LIFEWAY\u2019S BOARD APPROVED AN INCREASE IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT UNDER  OUR PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED 2015 STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM (THE \u201c2017 REPURCHASE PLAN AMENDMENT\u201d), BY ADDING TO (I.E.,  EXCLUSIVE OF THE SHARES PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED UNDER THE 2015 STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM) THE AUTHORIZATION THE LESSER OF $5,185 OR  625 SHARES. WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 156 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A COST OF $385 DURING THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30,  2019 UNDER THE 2017 REPURCHASE PLAN AMENDMENT. WE MAY EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE OPEN MARKET OR BY PRIVATE NEGOTIATION,  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WE INTEND TO HOLD REPURCHASED SHARES IN TREASURY FOR GENERAL  CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING ISSUANCES UNDER OUR 2015 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN. TREASURY SHARES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE COST  METHOD.  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  ON APRIL 10, 2019, EFFECTIVE MARCH 31,  2019, LIFEWAY ENTERED INTO THE FIRST MODIFICATION TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT (THE \u201cMODIFIED  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d) WITH ITS EXISTING LENDER. UNDER THE AMENDMENT, THE MODIFIED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES  FOR A REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT UP TO A MAXIMUM OF $9 MILLION (THE \u201cREVOLVING LOAN\u201d) WITH AN INCREMENTAL FACILITY NOT  TO EXCEED $5 MILLION (THE \u201cINCREMENTAL FACILITY\u201d AND TOGETHER WITH THE REVOLVING LOAN, THE \u201cLOANS\u201d).  ALL OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS UNDER THE LOANS  BEAR INTEREST, BASED ON A LEVEL OF THE SENIOR DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO, AT LIFEWAY\u2019S ELECTION, AT EITHER THE LENDER BASE RATE  (THE GREATER OF EITHER THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE PLUS 0.0% TO 0.5%, OR THE PRIME RATE) OR THE LIBOR PLUS 2.25% TO 3.00%, PAYABLE MONTHLY  IN ARREARS. LIFEWAY IS ALSO REQUIRED TO PAY A QUARTERLY UNUSED LINE FEE AND, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF ANY LETTERS OF  CREDIT, A LETTER OF CREDIT FEE.  AS AMENDED, THE MODIFIED REVOLVING CREDIT  FACILITY CONTAINS CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND COVENANTS ON THE PART OF LIFEWAY, INCLUDING FINANCIAL COVENANTS REQUIRING  US TO ACHIEVE A MINIMUM EBITDA THRESHOLD FOR EACH OF THE FISCAL QUARTERS THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND MAINTAIN A FIXED CHARGE  COVERAGE RATIO OF NO LESS THAN 1.25 TO 1.0 EACH OF THE FISCAL QUARTERS ENDING THROUGH THE EXPIRATION DATE.

SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, AND OTHER FACTORS WHICH MAY CAUSE THE ACTUAL RESULTS,  PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS OF BRIDGFORD FOODS CORPORATION TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY FUTURE RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR  ACHIEVEMENTS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH FACTORS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE FOLLOWING: GENERAL  ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS; THE IMPACT OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND PRICING; SUCCESS OF OPERATING INITIATIVES; DEVELOPMENT  AND OPERATING COSTS; ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EFFORTS; ADVERSE PUBLICITY; ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS; CONSUMER TRIAL  AND FREQUENCY; CHANGES IN BUSINESS STRATEGY OR DEVELOPMENT PLANS; AVAILABILITY, TERMS AND DEPLOYMENT OF CAPITAL; AVAILABILITY  OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL; COMMODITY, LABOR, AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS; CHANGES IN, OR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS;  WEATHER CONDITIONS; CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULES; AND OTHER FACTORS REFERENCED IN THIS REPORT. ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO BUDGETING, MARKETING,  AND OTHER MANAGEMENT DECISIONS ARE SUBJECTIVE IN MANY RESPECTS AND THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO INTERPRETATIONS AND PERIODIC REVISIONS  BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS, THE IMPACT OF WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO ALTER OUR MARKETING, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE  OR OTHER BUDGETS, WHICH MAY IN TURN AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THE READER  IS THEREFORE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN AND TO CONSIDER OTHER RISKS  DETAILED MORE FULLY IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2018 (THE \u201cANNUAL REPORT\u201d).  WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY RELEASE THE RESULT OF ANY REVISIONS TO THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WHICH MAY BE MADE  TO REFLECT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES AFTER THE DATE HEREOF, OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED EVENTS.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES  THE  PREPARATION OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED REVENUES  AND EXPENSES DURING THE RESPECTIVE REPORTING PERIODS. SOME OF THE ESTIMATES NEEDED TO BE MADE BY MANAGEMENT INCLUDE THE ALLOWANCE  FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, PROMOTIONAL AND RETURNS ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY RESERVES, THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT,  AND THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  WE DETERMINE THE AMOUNTS TO RECORD BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE VIEW AS REASONABLE UNDER  THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSIDER ALL RELEVANT AVAILABLE INFORMATION. THE RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS FORM THE BASIS FOR OUR CONCLUSION  AS TO THE VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE FROM OTHER INDEPENDENT SOURCES. AMOUNTS ESTIMATED RELATED  TO LIABILITIES FOR SELF-INSURED WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION, EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE AND PENSION BENEFITS ARE ESPECIALLY SUBJECT TO  INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THESE ESTIMATED LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY SETTLE AT AMOUNTS WHICH VARY FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES.  CURRENT  ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRE THAT OUR PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATION BE MEASURED USING AN INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN (\u201cIRR\u201d)  ANALYSIS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE DISCOUNT RATE SELECTION PROCESS. THE IRR CALCULATION FOR THE RETIREMENT PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES OF BRIDGFORD  FOODS CORPORATION IS MEASURED ANNUALLY AND BASED ON THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT RATE. THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT RATE AS  OF JULY 31, 2019 WAS 3.44% AS COMPARED TO 4.30% AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2018. THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE  VALUE OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AS WELL AS THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST.  OUR  CREDIT RISK IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF CUSTOMERS AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. LOSSES DUE TO CREDIT RISK HAVE RECENTLY BEEN  IMMATERIAL. THE PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IS BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS AND CURRENT COLLECTION RISK. WE HAVE  SIGNIFICANT RECEIVABLES WITH A FEW LARGE, WELL KNOWN CUSTOMERS WHICH, ALTHOUGH HISTORICALLY SECURE, COULD BE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL  RISK SHOULD THESE CUSTOMERS\u2019 OPERATIONS SUDDENLY DETERIORATE. WE MONITOR THESE CUSTOMERS CLOSELY TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF  LOSS.  THE  TABLE BELOW SHOWS CUSTOMERS THAT ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 20% OF CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (\u201cAR\u201d) OR 10% OF  CONSOLIDATED SALES FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED JULY 12, 2019 AND JULY 13, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.

SALES  ARE RECOGNIZED UPON PASSAGE OF TITLE TO THE CUSTOMER, TYPICALLY UPON PRODUCT PICK-UP, SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY TO CUSTOMERS. PRODUCTS  ARE DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR OWN LONG-HAUL FLEET OR THROUGH OUR OWN DIRECT STORE DELIVERY SYSTEM.  12  OF 24  WE  RECORD THE CASH SURRENDER OR CONTRACT VALUE FOR LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES AS AN ADJUSTMENT OF PREMIUMS PAID IN DETERMINING THE EXPENSE  OR INCOME TO BE RECOGNIZED UNDER THE CONTRACT FOR THE PERIOD.  WE  PROVIDE TAX RESERVES FOR FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSURES RELATING TO AUDIT RESULTS, TAX PLANNING INITIATIVES  AND COMPLIANCE RESPONSIBILITIES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE RESERVES REQUIRES JUDGMENTS ABOUT TAX ISSUES, POTENTIAL OUTCOMES AND  TIMING, AND IS A SUBJECTIVE ESTIMATE. ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME OF THESE TAX AUDITS IS UNCERTAIN, IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S OPINION ADEQUATE  PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN MADE FOR POTENTIAL LIABILITIES, IF ANY, RESULTING FROM THESE REVIEWS. ACTUAL OUTCOMES MAY  DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  WE  ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OR WHENEVER ADVERSE EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES  OR BUSINESS CLIMATE INDICATE THAT EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO SUCH LONG-LIVED ASSETS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT  TO SUPPORT THE NET BOOK VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS. IF UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE RECORDED ASSETS, WE  RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE APPLICABLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.  WE  PARTICIPATE IN \u201cMULTIEMPLOYER\u201d PENSION PLANS ADMINISTERED BY LABOR UNIONS ON BEHALF OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. WE PAY MONTHLY  CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNION TRUST FUNDS, A PORTION OF WHICH IS USED TO FUND PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. THE CONTRIBUTION  AMOUNT MAY CHANGE DEPENDING UPON THE ABILITY OF PARTICIPATING COMPANIES TO FUND THESE PENSION LIABILITIES AS WELL AS THE ACTUAL  AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS. SHOULD WE WITHDRAW FROM THE UNION AND CEASE PARTICIPATION IN A UNION PLAN, FEDERAL  LAW COULD IMPOSE A PENALTY FOR ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN. THE PENALTY WOULD BE RECORDED AS AN EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED  STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF THE WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY IS DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE FUNDED  STATUS OF THE PLAN AND CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY OTHER PARTICIPATING COMPANIES.  IN  MARCH 2010, THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AS AMENDED BY THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT (COLLECTIVELY,  THE \u201cPPACA\u201d), WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW INCLUDE THE REMOVAL OF THE LIFETIME LIMITS ON ACTIVE AND  RETIREE MEDICAL COVERAGE, EXPANDING DEPENDENT COVERAGE TO AGE 26 AND THE ELIMINATION OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT MAY IMPACT  OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS COSTS. IN ADDITION, THE PPACA INCLUDES POTENTIAL EXCISE TAX ON THE VALUE OF BENEFITS THAT EXCEED  A PRE-DEFINED LIMIT WHICH MAY REQUIRE CHANGES IN BENEFIT PLAN LEVELS IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THIS ADDITIONAL COST. FINALLY, THE PPACA  INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO OFFER HEALTH BENEFITS TO ALL FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES (DEFINED AS 30 HOURS PER WEEK).  THE HEALTH COVERAGE MUST MEET MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE ACTUARIAL VALUE OF THE BENEFITS OFFERED AND EMPLOYEE AFFORDABILITY. BOTH  THE ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS HAVE MADE RECENT ATTEMPTS TO REPLACE THE PPACA WITH AN ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT  ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE RULES THAT COMPEL AN EMPLOYER SUCH AS BRIDGFORD FOODS TO OFFER AFFORDABLE COVERAGE TO ALL  OF ITS EMPLOYEES. THE RECENT TAX LAW CHANGES REMOVED THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PROVISION THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE PPACA AND REQUIRES  ALL INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE OR PAY A PENALTY. DESPITE THIS CHANGE, THE RECENT TAX CHANGES DID NOT ADJUST OR REMOVE  THE EMPLOYER MANDATE. WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE FURTHER CHANGES AT THIS POINT IN TIME. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT PLANS MEET THE EXISTING  REQUIREMENTS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS OF THE PPACA AND ITS IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS MORE LEGISLATIVE AND INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE BECOMES AVAILABLE. THE POTENTIAL FUTURE EFFECTS AND COST OF  COMPLYING WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE PPACA ARE NOT DETERMINABLE AT THIS TIME  OVERVIEW  OF REPORTING SEGMENTS  WE  OPERATE IN TWO BUSINESS SEGMENTS \u2013 THE PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION OF FROZEN FOOD PRODUCTS (THE FROZEN FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT),  AND THE PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION OF SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS (THE SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT). FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE SEPARATE  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS REFER TO NOTE 4 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.

FROZEN  FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT  OUR  FROZEN FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT PRIMARILY MANUFACTURES AND DISTRIBUTES BISCUITS, BREAD DOUGH ITEMS, ROLL DOUGH ITEMS AND SHELF STABLE  SANDWICHES. ALL ITEMS WITHIN THIS SEGMENT ARE CONSIDERED SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED AT THIS LEVEL. OUR FROZEN FOOD  BUSINESS COVERS THE UNITED STATES. PRODUCTS PRODUCED BY THE FROZEN FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT ARE GENERALLY SUPPLIED TO FOOD SERVICE  AND RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS WHO TAKE TITLE TO THE PRODUCT UPON SHIPMENT RECEIPT THROUGH COMPANY LEASED LONG-HAUL VEHICLES. IN ADDITION  TO REGIONAL SALES MANAGERS, WE MAINTAIN A NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT FOOD SERVICE AND RETAIL BROKERS COVERING MOST OF THE UNITED STATES.  BROKERS ARE COMPENSATED ON A COMMISSION BASIS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR BROKER RELATIONSHIPS, IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH OUR REGIONAL  SALES MANAGERS, ARE A VALUABLE ASSET PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT NEW PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER OPPORTUNITIES. REGIONAL SALES MANAGERS PERFORM  SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT FUNCTIONS FOR US, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND PROVIDING CUSTOMER SERVICE  AND SUPPORT TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND END PURCHASERS THROUGH THE EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR BROKER NETWORK.  13  OF 24  SNACK  FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT  OUR  SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT PRIMARILY DISTRIBUTES PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY US. ALL ITEMS WITHIN THIS SEGMENT ARE CONSIDERED SIMILAR  PRODUCTS AND HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED AT THIS LEVEL. THE DRY SAUSAGE DIVISION INCLUDES PRODUCTS SUCH AS JERKY, MEAT SNACKS, SAUSAGE  AND PEPPERONI PRODUCTS. OUR SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT SELLS APPROXIMATELY 120 DIFFERENT ITEMS THROUGH A DIRECT STORE DELIVERY  NETWORK SERVING APPROXIMATELY 17,000 SUPERMARKETS, MASS MERCHANDISE AND CONVENIENCE RETAIL STORES LOCATED IN 48 STATES. THESE  CUSTOMERS ARE COMPRISED OF LARGE RETAIL CHAINS AND SMALLER \u201cINDEPENDENT\u201d OPERATORS.  PRODUCTS  PRODUCED OR DISTRIBUTED BY THE SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT ARE SUPPLIED TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH EITHER DIRECT-STORE-DELIVERY OR DIRECT  DELIVERY TO CUSTOMER WAREHOUSES. PRODUCT DELIVERED USING THE COMPANY-OWNED FLEET DIRECT TO THE STORE IS CONSIDERED A DIRECT-STORE-DELIVERY.  IN THIS CASE, WE PROVIDE THE SERVICE OF SETTING UP AND MAINTAINING THE DISPLAY AND STOCKING OUR PRODUCTS. PRODUCTS DELIVERED TO  CUSTOMER WAREHOUSES ARE DISTRIBUTED TO THE RETAIL STORE AND STOCKED BY THE CUSTOMER WHERE IT IS THEN RESOLD TO THE END CONSUMER.

THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN VOLUME FOR OUR SHELF-STABLE  SANDWICH BUSINESS TO INSTITUTIONAL AND RETAIL CUSTOMERS COUPLED WITH AN INCREASE IN SELLING PRICES IMPLEMENTED IN THE SECOND QUARTER  OF FISCAL YEAR 2019. OTHER INSTITUTIONAL FROZEN FOOD PRODUCT SALES, INCLUDING SHEET DOUGH AND ROLLS, INCREASED 5% BY VOLUME WHILE  RETAIL SALES VOLUME DECREASED 2%. PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER BID PRICE REDUCTIONS, REBATES AND MENU ALLOWANCES  AS A PERCENT OF SALES.

THE INCREASE IN NET SALES OCCURRED MAINLY IN OUR DIRECT STORE DELIVERY DISTRIBUTION  CHANNEL WHILE WAREHOUSE SHIPMENTS DECREASED. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER POUND INCREASED COMPARED TO THE SAME TWELVE-WEEK  PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR DUE TO HIGHER PER POUND SELLING PRICES FOR NEW ITEMS. PROMOTIONAL OFFERS INCREASED DUE TO THE  TIMING OF PROGRAMS WITH SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS. RETURNS ACTIVITY WAS HIGHER COMPARED TO THE SAME TWELVE-WEEK PERIOD IN THE 2018  FISCAL YEAR.  COST  OF PRODUCTS SOLD AND GROSS MARGIN-CONSOLIDATED  COST  OF PRODUCTS SOLD INCREASED BY $3,388 (13.0%) TO $29,422 IN THE THIRD TWELVE-WEEK PERIOD OF THE 2019 FISCAL YEAR COMPARED TO THE  SAME TWELVE-WEEK PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR 2018.

MEAT COMMODITY COSTS STARTED TO DROP DURING THE 2019 PERIOD PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE INCREASE IN COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD. HIGHER  HOURLY WAGES INCLUDING INCREASED PRODUCTION LABOR IMPACTED THE COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD. THE COST OF SIGNIFICANT MEAT COMMODITIES  DECREASED APPROXIMATELY $555 IN THE THIRD TWELVE-WEEK PERIOD OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR 2018.

HEALTHCARE COSTS HAVE INCREASED DUE TO RECENT UNFAVORABLE CLAIM ACTIVITY. HIGHER  PROFIT-SHARING ACCRUALS RESULTED IN HIGHER WAGES AND BONUS EXPENSE IN THE THIRD TWELVE WEEKS OF THE 2019 FISCAL YEAR COMPARED  TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN PENSION EXPENSE WAS DUE TO HIGHER PENSION DISCOUNT RATES BEING USED  TO COMPUTE THE FUTURE LIABILITY ESTIMATE. NONE OF THE CHANGES INDIVIDUALLY OR AS A GROUP OF EXPENSES IN \u201cOTHER SG&A\u201d  WERE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO MERIT SEPARATE DISCLOSURE.

THE OVERALL INCREASE IN SG&A EXPENSES WAS DUE TO  HIGHER SALES UNIT VOLUME AND TO A LESSER EXTENT INCREASES IN SELLING PRICES. THE INCREASES IN UNIT SALES VOLUME WERE  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PROMOTIONAL AND RETURN ACTIVITY CORRESPONDING TO THE INCREASE IN SALES UNIT VOLUME.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES-SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT  SG&A  EXPENSES IN THE SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT INCREASED BY $659 (8.5%) TO $8,385 IN THE THIRD TWELVE-WEEK PERIOD OF FISCAL YEAR  2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME TWELVE-WEEK PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.

INCREASED VOLUME AND CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX WERE  THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THIS INCREASE. THE COST OF PURCHASED FLOUR DECREASED APPROXIMATELY $66 IN THE THIRTY-SIX-WEEK  PERIOD OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR 2018.  COST  OF PRODUCTS SOLD-SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT  COST  OF PRODUCTS SOLD IN THE SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT INCREASED BY $4,556 (7.8%) TO $63,051 IN THE THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD ENDED  JULY 12, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 DUE TO A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME. MEAT  COMMODITY COSTS STARTED TO DROP DURING THE 2019 PERIOD PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE INCREASE IN COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD. HIGHER HOURLY  WAGES INCLUDING INCREASED PRODUCTION LABOR IMPACTED THE COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD. THE COST OF SIGNIFICANT MEAT COMMODITIES DECREASED  APPROXIMATELY $2,125 IN THE THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD ENDED JULY 12, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR 2018.  17  OF 24  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES-CONSOLIDATED  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $2,300 (6.7%) TO $36,514 IN THE THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD ENDED JULY  12, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.

THE DECREASE IN PENSION EXPENSE WAS DUE TO HIGHER PENSION DISCOUNT RATES BEING USED TO COMPUTE  THE FUTURE LIABILITY ESTIMATE. REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE DECREASED AS THE COMPANY GEARED UP ITS CHICAGO FACILITY IN THE  SAME THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO COMPLY WITH FOOD SAFETY CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS CREATED AND MANAGED BY THE  SQF INSTITUTE. THE GAIN ON CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES DECREASED SUBSTANTIALLY DUE TO LOWER STOCK MARKET GAINS  COMPARED TO THE SAME THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR 2018. HEALTHCARE COSTS HAVE INCREASED DUE TO RECENT UNFAVORABLE CLAIM  ACTIVITY. COSTS FOR PRODUCT ADVERTISING INCREASED MAINLY AS A RESULT OF HIGHER PAYMENTS UNDER BRAND LICENSING AGREEMENTS IN THE  SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT DURING THE THIRTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED JULY 12, 2019. NONE OF THE CHANGES INDIVIDUALLY OR AS A GROUP OF  EXPENSES IN \u201cOTHER SG&A\u201d WERE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO MERIT SEPARATE DISCLOSURE. THE MAJOR COMPONENTS COMPRISING  THE INCREASE OF \u201cOTHER SG&A\u201d EXPENSES WERE HIGHER TRAVEL EXPENSES AND HIGHER INSURANCE COSTS.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES-FROZEN FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT  SG&A  EXPENSES IN THE FROZEN FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT INCREASED BY $564 (5.8%) TO $10,325 IN THE THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD ENDED JULY 12,  2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE OVERALL INCREASE IN SG&A EXPENSES WAS DUE TO  HIGHER UNIT SALES VOLUME, HIGHER PROFIT-SHARING ACCRUALS AND HIGHER PRODUCT ADVERTISING.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES-SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT  SG&A  EXPENSES IN THE SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT INCREASED BY $1,736 (7.1%) TO $26,189 IN THE THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD ENDED JULY 12,  2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. MOST OF THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER UNIT SALES VOLUME  AND HIGHER EXPENSES RELATED TO WAGES AND BONUSES INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN SALES COMMISSIONS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PENSION  EXPENSE.  INCOME  TAXES-CONSOLIDATED  INCOME  TAX FOR THE THIRTY-SIX-WEEKS ENDED JULY 12, 2019 AND JULY 13, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WAS AS FOLLOWS.  JULY 12, 2019  JULY 13, 2018  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  $1,764  $5,786  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  25.3%  56.5%  WE  RECORDED A TAX PROVISION OF $1,764 FOR THE THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD ENDED JULY 12, 2019, RELATED TO FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES, BASED  ON THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPECTED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE DIFFERED FROM THE APPLICABLE MIXED STATUTORY  RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 26.4% ALSO DUE TO NON-TAXABLE GAINS AND LOSSES ON LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES.  WE  RECORDED A TAX PROVISION OF $5,786 FOR THE THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD ENDED JULY 13, 2018, RELATED TO FEDERAL AND STATE TAXES, BASED  ON THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPECTED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 REFLECTS IMPACTS  OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT SIGNED INTO LAW ON DECEMBER 22, 2017. THESE IMPACTS INCLUDE A $3,200 EXPENSE RELATED TO THE REMEASUREMENT  OF DEFERRED TAXES, AS WELL AS A BLENDED 23.07% STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2018 COMPARED TO THE 35% STATUTORY  FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE EFFECTIVE FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. THE RATE ALSO REFLECTS IMPACT OF $1,640 MILLION OF EXPENSE RELATED TO TAX  ON THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF A LAND PARCEL IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 PART I, ITEM 1(E), - INCOME TAXES OF THE NOTES  TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE ALSO DIFFERED FROM THE APPLICABLE  MIXED STATUTORY RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 27.55% DUE TO NON- TAXABLE GAINS AND LOSSES ON LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES AND DOMESTIC PRODUCTION  ACTIVITIES DEDUCTIONS UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 199.  NET  INCOME CONSOLIDATED  THE  NET INCOME OF $5,201 IN THE THIRTY-SIX-WEEKS PERIOD ENDED JULY 12, 2019 INCLUDES A NON-TAXABLE GAIN ON LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES  IN THE AMOUNT OF $714. THE NET INCOME OF $4,455 IN THE THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD ENDED JULY 13, 2018 INCLUDES A NON-RECURRING GAIN  ON THE SALE OF REAL PROPERTY FOR $5,977 (BEFORE TAXES) AND A NON-TAXABLE GAIN ON LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,088.  GAINS AND LOSSES ON LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING EQUITIES THAT SUPPORT POLICY  VALUES AND FUTURE RESULTS MAY VARY CONSIDERABLY.  18  OF 24  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE  PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF OUR OPERATING CASH FLOW IS CASH RECEIPTS FROM THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS, NET OF COSTS TO MANUFACTURE, STORE,  MARKET AND DELIVER SUCH PRODUCTS. WE HAVE REMAINED FREE OF INTEREST-BEARING DEBT (EXCLUDING CAPITAL LEASES AND EQUIPMENT FINANCING)  FOR TWENTY-NINE OF THE LAST THIRTY YEARS (WITH FISCAL YEARS 2014 AND 2019 BEING THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS) AND WE NORMALLY FUND  OUR OPERATIONS FROM CASH BALANCES AND CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. WE BORROWED $7,500 DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR 2019 TO PURCHASE SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT FOR OUR NEW CHICAGO PROCESSING FACILITY. WE BORROWED A SECOND $7,500 SUBSEQUENT TO THE  END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019. HISTORICALLY, WE EXPECT POSITIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF OUR  FISCAL YEAR FROM THE LIQUIDATION OF INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES RELATED TO HOLIDAY SEASON SALES. ANTICIPATED COMMODITY  PRICE TRENDS MAY AFFECT FUTURE CASH BALANCES. CERTAIN COMMODITIES MAY BE PURCHASED IN ADVANCE OF OUR IMMEDIATE NEEDS TO LOWER  THE ULTIMATE COST OF PROCESSING.

THE NET INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER NET  INCOME OF $5,297 PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY OF $630 AND A INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $659 AS WELL AS  PAYMENTS FOR ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES OF $564. DURING THE THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD ENDED JULY 12, 2019, WE CONTRIBUTED $601 TOWARDS  OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN. PLAN FUNDING STRATEGIES MAY BE ADJUSTED DEPENDING UPON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INVESTMENT OPTIONS,  TAX DEDUCTIBILITY, OR RECENT LEGISLATIVE CHANGES IN FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY BORROWED $2,000 UNDER ITS LINE OF  CREDIT WITH WELLS FARGO BANK N.A. ON APRIL 15, 2019, WHICH WAS REPAID ON APRIL 25, 2019.  OUR  CASH CONVERSION CYCLE (DEFINED AS DAYS OF INVENTORY AND TRADE RECEIVABLES LESS DAYS OF TRADE PAYABLES OUTSTANDING) WAS EQUAL TO  60 DAYS FOR THE THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD ENDED JULY 12, 2019. THE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE WAS 63 DAYS FOR THE THIRTY-SIX-WEEK PERIOD  ENDED JULY 13, 2018.  FOR  THE THIRTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED JULY 13, 2018, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $5,000 PRIMARILY DUE TO A NET INCOME OF  $4,455 AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES OF $3,200 PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES OF $3,991 AND PAYMENTS OF  ESTIMATED TAXES OF $1,407.

UNDER THE STOCK  REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE ARE AUTHORIZED, AT THE DISCRETION OF MANAGEMENT AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, TO PURCHASE UP TO AN AGGREGATE  OF 2,000,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE OPEN MARKET. AS OF JULY 12, 2019, 120,113 SHARES WERE AUTHORIZED FOR REPURCHASE  UNDER THE PROGRAM.  ON  DECEMBER 26, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A MASTER COLLATERAL LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A FOR UP TO $15,000  IN EQUIPMENT FINANCING. PURSUANT TO THE LOAN AGREEMENT, WE BORROWED $15,000, TWO SEPARATE RECEIPTS OF $7,500 EACH, TO PURCHASE  SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT FOR OUR NEW CHICAGO PROCESSING FACILITY AT A FIXED RATE OF 4.13% AND 3.98%, RESPECTIVELY, PER ANNUM. THE LOAN  TERMS ARE SEVEN YEARS AND ARE SECURED BY THE PURCHASED EQUIPMENT. THE FIRST FUNDING OF $7,500 WAS RECEIVED ON DECEMBER 28, 2018.  THE SECOND FUNDING WAS RECEIVED ON APRIL 23, 2019. THE MASTER COLLATERAL LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, N.A.  CONTAINS VARIOUS AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS THAT LIMIT THE USE OF FUNDS AND DEFINE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE LOAN. THE MAIN  FINANCIAL COVENANTS ARE LISTED BELOW.  \u25cf  TOTAL  LIABILITIES DIVIDED BY TANGIBLE NET WORTH NOT GREATER THAN 2.5 TO 1.0 AT EACH FISCAL QUARTER,  \u25cf  QUICK  RATIO NOT LESS THAN 1.0 TO 1.0 AT EACH FISCAL QUARTER END, AND  \u25cf  NET  INCOME AFTER TAXES NOT LESS THAN ONE DOLLAR ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, DETERMINED AS OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER END.  THE  COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE MASTER COLLATERAL LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT AS OF JULY 12, 2019.  THE  IMPACT OF INFLATION ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAS NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT. MANAGEMENT IS  OF THE OPINION THAT THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL POSITION AND ITS CAPITAL RESOURCES ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE FOR ITS OPERATING  NEEDS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  20  OF 24  RECENT  ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN  MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT CHANGES THE CRITERIA FOR RECOGNIZING REVENUE. THE GUIDANCE PROVIDES FOR A SINGLE FIVE-STEP  MODEL TO BE APPLIED TO ALL REVENUE CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE STANDARD ALSO REQUIRES ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCLOSURES  THAT WILL ENABLE USERS TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS RELATING TO CUSTOMER  CONTRACTS, INCLUDING DISAGGREGATED REVENUE DISCLOSURES. COMPANIES HAVE AN OPTION TO USE EITHER A RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH OR CUMULATIVE  EFFECT ADJUSTMENT APPROACH TO IMPLEMENT THE STANDARD.

WE ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE TRANSITION METHOD. PRIOR PERIODS WERE NOT ADJUSTED AND,  BASED ON OUR IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT, NO CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT WAS MADE TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS.  THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE ALSO SELL, FROM TIME TO TIME, TIMBERLAND AND SPECIAL USE PROPERTIES, WHICH CONSIST OF SURPLUS PROPERTIES, HIGHER AND BETTER USE (\u201cHBU\u201d) PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cGAAP\u201d). THE PREPARATION OF THESE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE PRINCIPLES, REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCUSSED IN PART II, ITEM 7 \u2013 MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE  2018  FORM 10-K. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF THESE POLICIES ENABLES US TO PROVIDE READERS OF THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH USEFUL AND RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, EXCEPT FOR CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS COMBINATION AND REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES AS DISCUSSED BELOW AND IN NOTE 2 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  WE COMPLETED OUR ACQUISITION OF CARAUSTAR INDUSTRIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (\u201cCARAUSTAR\u201d) ON FEBRUARY 11, 2019 (THE \u201cCARAUSTAR ACQUISITION\u201d) AND OUR ACQUISITION OF THOLU B.V. AND ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY A. THOMASSEN TRANSPORT B.V. (COLLECTIVELY \"THOLU\") ON JUNE 11, 2019 (THE \"THOLU ACQUISITION\"). THE CARAUSTAR ACQUISITION SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE PAPER PACKAGING & SERVICES SEGMENT PORTFOLIO. CARAUSTAR'S AND THOLU'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE PERIOD SUBSEQUENT TO THEIR RESPECTIVE ACQUISITION DATE.  UNDER THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WE ALLOCATE THE FAIR VALUE OF PURCHASE CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED TO THE TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BASED ON THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES ON THE DATE OF THE ACQUISITION. THE FAIR VALUES ASSIGNED, DEFINED AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN WILLING MARKET PARTICIPANTS, ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT. THE EXCESS PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OVER THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET OF LIABILITIES ASSUMED, IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL.  WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS. OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE, BUT WHICH ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND UNPREDICTABLE AND, AS A RESULT, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES.  DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, NOT TO EXCEED ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION, WE MAY RECORD ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WITH A CORRESPONDING OFFSET TO GOODWILL IF NEW INFORMATION IS OBTAINED RELATED TO FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXISTED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. AFTER THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, ANY SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. ACQUISITION COSTS, SUCH AS LEGAL AND CONSULTING FEES, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  SEE NOTE 3 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q.  RECENTLY ISSUED AND NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  SEE NOTE 1 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF RECENTLY ISSUED AND NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE INFORMATION IS PRESENTED FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JULY 31, 2019  AND  2018  . HISTORICAL REVENUES AND EARNINGS MAY OR MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS.  ITEMS THAT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES LISTED IN PART I, ITEM 1A \u2014 RISK FACTORS, OF THE  2018  FORM 10-K. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY USING DIFFERENT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, OR IF CONDITIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN THE FUTURE.  THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF ADJUSTED EBITDA IS USED THROUGHOUT THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BOTH FOR OUR CONSOLIDATED AND SEGMENT RESULTS. FOR OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS, EBITDA, ALSO A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME, PLUS INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, INCLUDING DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT CHARGES, PLUS INCOME TAX EXPENSE, PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME, PLUS INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, INCLUDING DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT CHARGES, PLUS INCOME TAX EXPENSE, PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, PLUS RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PLUS ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, PLUS NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, PLUS NON-CASH PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGES, LESS (GAIN) LOSS ON DISPOSAL  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS, EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET. SINCE WE DO NOT CALCULATE NET INCOME BY BUSINESS SEGMENT, ADJUSTED EBITDA BY BUSINESS SEGMENT IS RECONCILED TO OPERATING PROFIT BY BUSINESS SEGMENT LESS OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET, LESS EQUITY EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES, NET OF TAX, PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, PLUS RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PLUS ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, PLUS NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, PLUS NON-CASH PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGES, LESS (GAIN) LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS, EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET. WE USE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS ONE OF THE FINANCIAL MEASURES TO EVALUATE OUR HISTORICAL AND ONGOING OPERATIONS AND BELIEVE THAT THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL TO ENABLE INVESTORS TO PERFORM MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS OF OUR HISTORICAL AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, WE PRESENT OUR U.S. AND NON-U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AFTER ELIMINATING THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, NON-CASH PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGES, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT CHARGES, ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS AND (GAINS) LOSSES ON SALES OF BUSINESSES, NET, WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS ENABLE INVESTORS TO PERFORM A MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF THE GEOGRAPHIC SOURCE OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND IS INFORMATION THAT INVESTORS FIND VALUABLE. THE FOREGOING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT AND SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE OR SUBSTITUTE FOR, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. ACCORDINGLY, USERS OF THIS FINANCIAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.

LAND MANAGEMENT  AS OF  JULY 31, 2019  , OUR LAND MANAGEMENT SEGMENT CONSISTED OF APPROXIMATELY  251,000  ACRES OF TIMBER PROPERTIES IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. KEY FACTORS INFLUENCING PROFITABILITY IN THE LAND MANAGEMENT SEGMENT ARE.  \u2022  PLANNED LEVEL OF TIMBER SALES;  \u2022  SELLING PRICES AND CUSTOMER DEMAND;  \u2022  GAINS ON TIMBERLAND SALES; AND  \u2022  GAINS ON THE DISPOSAL OF DEVELOPMENT, SURPLUS AND HBU PROPERTIES (\u201cSPECIAL USE PROPERTY\u201d).  IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF OUR TIMBER PROPERTY, WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW OUR CURRENT PORTFOLIO AND EXPLORE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN OF THESE PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS PROCESS HAS LED US TO CHARACTERIZE OUR PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  SURPLUS PROPERTY, MEANING LAND THAT CANNOT BE EFFICIENTLY OR EFFECTIVELY MANAGED BY US, WHETHER DUE TO PARCEL SIZE, LACK OF PRODUCTIVITY, LOCATION, ACCESS LIMITATIONS OR FOR OTHER REASONS.  \u2022  HBU PROPERTY, MEANING LAND THAT IN ITS CURRENT STATE HAS A HIGHER MARKET VALUE FOR USES OTHER THAN GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER.  \u2022  DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY, MEANING HBU LAND THAT, WITH ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT, MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MARKET VALUE THAN ITS HBU MARKET VALUE.  \u2022  CORE TIMBERLAND, MEANING LAND THAT IS BEST SUITED FOR GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER.  WE REPORT THE DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS AND HBU PROPERTY IN OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME UNDER \u201cGAIN ON DISPOSALS OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET\u201d AND REPORT THE SALE OF DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY UNDER \u201cNET SALES\u201d AND \u201cCOST OF PRODUCTS SOLD.\u201d ALL HBU, DEVELOPMENT AND SURPLUS PROPERTY IS USED BY US TO PRODUCTIVELY GROW AND SELL TIMBER UNTIL SOLD. TIMBERLAND GAINS ARE RECORDED AS GAINS ON DISPOSALS OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT, NET.  WHETHER TIMBERLAND HAS A HIGHER VALUE FOR USES OTHER THAN GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER IS A DETERMINATION BASED UPON SEVERAL VARIABLES, SUCH AS PROXIMITY TO POPULATION CENTERS, ANTICIPATED POPULATION GROWTH IN THE AREA, THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE LAND, AESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS, INCLUDING ACCESS TO WATER, THE CONDITION OF THE SURROUNDING LAND, AVAILABILITY OF UTILITIES, MARKETS FOR TIMBER AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS BOTH NATIONALLY AND LOCALLY. GIVEN THESE CONSIDERATIONS, THE CHARACTERIZATION OF LAND IS NOT A STATIC PROCESS, BUT REQUIRES AN ONGOING REVIEW AND RE-CHARACTERIZATION AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE.

IS INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  OUR QUARTERLY INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 740-270 \"INCOME TAXES - INTERIM REPORTING.\" IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD, ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX EXPENSE IS COMPUTED BASED ON FORECASTED ANNUAL EARNINGS AND OTHER FORECASTED ANNUAL AMOUNTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITEMS SUCH AS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND WITHHOLDING TAXES. ADDITIONALLY, LOSSES FROM JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX RATE. INCOME TAX EXPENSE EACH QUARTER IS PROVIDED FOR ON A CURRENT YEAR-TO-DATE BASIS USING THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX RATE, ADJUSTED FOR DISCRETE TAXABLE EVENTS THAT OCCUR DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 WAS  $26.8 MILLION  ON  $92.1 MILLION  OF PRETAX INCOME AND INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 WAS  $25.7 MILLION  ON  $96.7 MILLION  OF PRETAX INCOME. THE INCREASE TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED MIX OF EARNINGS AMONG TAX JURISDICTIONS. THIS INCREASE WAS OFFSET BY A PROVISIONAL NET TAX BENEFIT OF  $1.1 MILLION  FOR THE ADDITION OF CARAUSTAR AND OTHER DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS OF  $0.3 MILLION  . INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 INCLUDED NET DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS OF  $0.1 MILLION.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT ADEQUATE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.  THE ESTIMATED NET DECREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS RANGES FROM  ZERO  TO  $6.5 MILLION  . ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THIS ESTIMATE.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS REPRESENTS THE PORTION OF EARNINGS FROM THE OPERATIONS OF OUR MAJORITY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES THAT WAS SUBTRACTED FROM NET INCOME TO ARRIVE AT NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO US. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTERS OF  2019  AND  2018  WAS  $4.8 MILLION  AND  $4.3 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE NET OPERATING PROFIT OF THE FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS & SERVICES SEGMENT JOINT VENTURE THAT WAS FORMED IN 2010 BY GREIF, INC. AND ONE OF ITS INDIRECT SUBSIDIARIES WITH DABBAGH GROUP HOLDING COMPANY LIMITED AND ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES (REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE \u201cFLEXIBLE PACKAGING JV\u201d OR \u201cFPS VIE\u201d).

ADDITIONALLY, LOSSES FROM JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX RATE. INCOME TAX EXPENSE EACH QUARTER IS PROVIDED FOR ON A CURRENT YEAR-TO-DATE BASIS USING THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX RATE, ADJUSTED FOR DISCRETE TAXABLE EVENTS THAT OCCUR DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD.

OTHER DISCRETE ITEMS INCLUDED  $7.7 MILLION  OF TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CARAUSTAR ACQUISITION AND REFINANCING COSTS AS WELL AS  $2.3 MILLION  OF TAX EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY DIVESTITURE. OTHER IMMATERIAL DISCRETE ITEMS IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 RESULTED IN A TAX BENEFIT OF  $4.3 MILLION  . DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018, A  $69.3 MILLION  TAX BENEFIT WAS RECORDED AS A RESULT OF THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX BALANCES DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM ENACTMENT OF THE TAX REFORM ACT. THIS BENEFIT WAS OFFSET BY A PROVISIONAL ESTIMATE OF  $35.9 MILLION  RELATED TO THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY INCLUDED IN THE TAX REFORM ACT.

MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY, NET  CHANGE IN MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY, NET FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF  2019  AND  2018  WAS  $2.2 MILLION  AND  $17.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RESULTING FROM THE CHANGE IN MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS AND THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RESULTING FROM THE CHANGE IN MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REMEASUREMENT OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN IN THE UNITED STATES AS A RESULT OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2018.

THE  $12.9 MILLION  DECREASE  IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS TO  $79.2 MILLION  AS OF  JULY 31, 2019  FROM $92.1 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN INCOME TAX RECEIVABLES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES, PROCEEDS FROM THE SENIOR NOTES WE HAVE ISSUED, AND PROCEEDS FROM OUR TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT FACILITIES. WE USE THESE SOURCES TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH DIVIDENDS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES AND ACQUISITIONS. WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING TO FUND THESE ITEMS IN A LIKE MANNER. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT OPERATING CASH FLOWS, BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES, AND PROCEEDS FROM OUR TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT FACILITIES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR ANTICIPATED WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH DIVIDENDS, DEBT REPAYMENT, POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES AND OTHER LIQUIDITY NEEDS FOR AT LEAST 12 MONTHS. MOREOVER, AS A RESULT OF THE TAX REFORM ACT, IF DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE NEEDED TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH DIVIDENDS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, OR ACQUISITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE WOULD BE NO ADDITIONAL U.S. TAXES ON SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS.  52  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 AND 2018, WE INVESTED  $92.9 MILLION  (EXCLUDING  $4.1 MILLION  FOR PURCHASES OF AND INVESTMENTS IN TIMBER PROPERTIES) AND  $88.1 MILLION  (EXCLUDING  $6.6 MILLION  FOR PURCHASES OF AND INVESTMENTS IN TIMBER PROPERTIES), RESPECTIVELY, IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EXCLUDING PURCHASES OF AND INVESTMENTS IN TIMBER PROPERTIES, TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $150.0 MILLION  TO  $170.0 MILLION  IN  2019  . WE ANTICIPATE THAT THESE EXPENDITURES WILL REPLACE AND IMPROVE EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND FUND NEW FACILITIES.  NONCONTROLLING INTEREST  WE HAVE CONDITIONAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO REDEEM THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY INTEREST OF CERTAIN NONCONTROLLING INTEREST HOLDERS IN CERTAIN OF OUR JOINT VENTURES AT WHICH TIME WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL CASH OUTFLOWS.  ON NOVEMBER 15, 2018, ONE OF THE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST OWNERS OF ONE OF OUR PAPER PACKAGING & SERVICES JOINT VENTURES EXERCISED ITS PUT OPTION TO REQUIRE US TO PURCHASE ALL OF ITS OWNERSHIP INTEREST.

PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 1, 2018, WE REMOVED FROM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE THE AMOUNT OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE SINCE THEY MET THE APPLICABLE CRITERIA OF ASC 860, \u201cTRANSFERS AND SERVICING,\u201d AND WE CONTINUED TO RECOGNIZE THE DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES ON OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, AS APPROPRIATE. THE RECEIVABLES WERE SOLD ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS WITH THE TOTAL FUNDS IN THE SERVICING COLLECTION ACCOUNTS PLEDGED TO THE BANKS BETWEEN SETTLEMENT DATES. THE CASH INITIALLY RECEIVED, ALONG WITH THE DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE, RELATED TO THE SALE OR ULTIMATE COLLECTION OF THE UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES AND WAS NOT SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT OTHER RISKS GIVEN THEIR SHORT TERM NATURE. THEREFORE, WE REFLECTED ALL CASH FLOWS UNDER THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SALES PROGRAMS AS OPERATING CASH FLOWS ON OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  WE PERFORM COLLECTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS ON THE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO THE PRIOR EUROPEAN RPA, THE NEW EUROPEAN RFA AND THE SINGAPORE RPA, SIMILAR TO THE PROCEDURES WE USE FOR COLLECTING ALL OF OUR RECEIVABLES. THE SERVICING LIABILITY FOR THESE RECEIVABLES IS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  SEE NOTE 4 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THESE VARIOUS RPAS AND RFA.  INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES  WE HAVE VARIOUS BORROWING FACILITIES WHICH CHARGE INTEREST BASED ON THE ONE MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR RATE PLUS AN INTEREST SPREAD.  IN 2019, WE ENTERED INTO SIX INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO THE DEBT INCURRED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF CARAUSTAR. SEE \"BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS - 2019 CREDIT AGREEMENT\". THESE SIX INTEREST RATE SWAPS HAVE A TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF  $1,300.0 MILLION  . WE RECEIVE VARIABLE RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED UPON ONE MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR, AND IN RETURN WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY INTEREST AT A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF  2.49%.  IN 2017, WE ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF  $300.0 MILLION  AND RECEIVED VARIABLE RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED UPON ONE MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR, AND IN RETURN WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY INTEREST AT A FIXED RATE OF  1.19%  PLUS AN INTEREST SPREAD.  THESE DERIVATIVES ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME LINE ITEM ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS AND IN THE SAME PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS.  SEE NOTE 10 AND NOTE 15 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REGARDING THE INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE HEDGES  WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ITS ATTENTION ON BUSINESS OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ENTER INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF CERTAIN EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS.  AS OF  JULY 31, 2019  , WE HAD OUTSTANDING FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IN THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF  $121.4 MILLION  (  $194.4 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2018  ).  SEE NOTE 10 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REGARDING THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE HEDGES.  CROSS CURRENCY SWAP  WE HAVE OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. ON MARCH 6, 2018 WE ENTERED INTO A CROSS CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT THAT SYNTHETICALLY SWAPS  $100.0  56  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MILLION  OF FIXED RATE DEBT TO EURO DENOMINATED FIXED RATE DEBT AT A RATE OF  2.35%  . THE AGREEMENT IS DESIGNATED AS A NET INVESTMENT HEDGE FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES AND WILL MATURE ON MARCH 6, 2023. ACCORDINGLY, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THIS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS INCLUDED IN THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL THE NET INVESTMENT IS SOLD, DILUTED, OR LIQUIDATED. INTEREST PAYMENTS RECEIVED FOR THE CROSS CURRENCY SWAP ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE NET INVESTMENT HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT AND ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE, NET ON THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

COMPARABLE SALES IS A MEASURE THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR STORES AND DIGITAL CHANNELS BY MEASURING THE CHANGE IN SALES FOR A PERIOD OVER THE COMPARABLE, PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD OF EQUIVALENT LENGTH. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDE ALL SALES, EXCEPT SALES FROM STORES OPEN LESS THAN 13 MONTHS, DIGITAL ACQUISITIONS WE HAVE OWNED LESS THAN 13 MONTHS, STORES THAT HAVE BEEN CLOSED, AND DIGITAL ACQUISITIONS THAT WE NO LONGER OPERATE. COMPARABLE SALES MEASURES VARY ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, OUR COMPARABLE SALES CALCULATION IS NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. DIGITALLY ORIGINATED SALES INCLUDE ALL SALES INITIATED THROUGH MOBILE APPLICATIONS AND OUR WEBSITES. OUR STORES FULFILL THE MAJORITY OF DIGITALLY ORIGINATED SALES, INCLUDING SHIPMENT FROM STORES TO GUESTS, STORE PICK-UP OR DRIVE-UP, AND DELIVERY VIA OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, SHIPT. DIGITALLY ORIGINATED SALES MAY ALSO BE FULFILLED THROUGH OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, OUR VENDORS, OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES.  THE INCREASE IN SALES DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  , IS DUE TO A COMPARABLE SALES INCREASE OF  3.4 PERCENT  AND  4.1 PERCENT  , RESPECTIVELY, AND THE CONTRIBUTION FROM NEW STORES.

OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE INCLUDES SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF  $796 MILLION  ,  $769 MILLION  , AND  $353 MILLION  AS OF  AUGUST 3, 2019  ,  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , AND  AUGUST 4, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR INVESTMENT POLICY IS DESIGNED TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL AND LIQUIDITY OF OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. THIS POLICY ALLOWS INVESTMENTS IN LARGE MONEY MARKET FUNDS OR IN HIGHLY RATED DIRECT SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS THAT MATURE IN 60 DAYS OR LESS. WE ALSO PLACE DOLLAR LIMITS ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL FUNDS OR INSTRUMENTS.  CAPITAL ALLOCATION  WE FOLLOW A DISCIPLINED AND BALANCED APPROACH TO CAPITAL ALLOCATION BASED ON THE FOLLOWING PRIORITIES, RANKED IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE: FIRST, WE FULLY INVEST IN OPPORTUNITIES TO PROFITABLY GROW OUR BUSINESS, CREATE SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM VALUE, AND MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS AND ASSETS; SECOND, WE MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AND SEEK TO GROW IT ANNUALLY; AND FINALLY, WE RETURN ANY EXCESS CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS BY REPURCHASING SHARES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF OUR CREDIT RATING GOALS.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS  OPERATING CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY CONTINUING OPERATIONS WAS  $2,810 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  $2,723 MILLION  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018. THE OPERATING CASH FLOW  INCREASE  RESULTED FROM HIGHER NET EARNINGS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CASH SETTLEMENT OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE IN 2019 DRIVEN BY ELEVATED 2018 INVENTORY LEVELS.  INVENTORY  INVENTORY WAS  $9,122 MILLION  AS OF  AUGUST 3, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  $9,497 MILLION  AND  $9,112 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , AND  AUGUST 4, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE FROM FEBRUARY 2, 2019, REFLECTS A REDUCTION FROM ELEVATED YEAR-END INVENTORY LEVELS.  DIVIDENDS  WE PAID DIVIDENDS TOTALING  $328 MILLION  (  $0.64  PER SHARE) AND  $658 MILLION  (  $1.28  PER SHARE) FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  $330 MILLION  (  $0.62  PER SHARE) AND  $665 MILLION  (  $1.24  PER SHARE) FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 4, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, A PER SHARE INCREASE OF  3.2  PERCENT. WE DECLARED DIVIDENDS TOTALING  $341 MILLION  (  $0.66  PER SHARE) DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  , A PER SHARE INCREASE OF  3.1  PERCENT OVER THE  $340 MILLION  (  $0.64  PER SHARE) OF DECLARED DIVIDENDS DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2018  . WE HAVE PAID DIVIDENDS EVERY QUARTER SINCE OUR 1967 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING, AND IT IS OUR INTENT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE.  SHARE REPURCHASE  WE RETURNED $341 MILLION AND $618 MILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASE DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  . SEE PART II, ITEM 2 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION.  FINANCING  OUR FINANCING STRATEGY IS TO ENSURE LIQUIDITY AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, TO MAINTAIN A BALANCED SPECTRUM OF DEBT MATURITIES, AND TO MANAGE OUR NET EXPOSURE TO FLOATING INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY. WITHIN THESE PARAMETERS, WE SEEK TO MINIMIZE OUR BORROWING COSTS. OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE LONG-TERM DEBT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS HAS PROVIDED US WITH AMPLE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. OUR CONTINUED ACCESS TO THESE MARKETS DEPENDS ON MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING THE CONDITION OF DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND MAINTAINING STRONG CREDIT RATINGS. AS OF  AUGUST 3, 2019  , OUR CREDIT RATINGS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  CREDIT RATINGS  MOODY\u2019S  STANDARD AND POOR\u2019S  FITCH  LONG-TERM DEBT  A2  A  A-  COMMERCIAL PAPER  P-1  A-1  F1  19  IF OUR CREDIT RATINGS WERE LOWERED, OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT MARKETS, OUR COST OF FUNDS, AND OTHER TERMS FOR NEW DEBT ISSUANCES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. EACH OF THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES REVIEWS ITS RATING PERIODICALLY AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS WILL REMAIN THE SAME AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. FITCH RAISED OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER RATING FROM F2 TO F1 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019.  IN MARCH 2019, WE ISSUED  $1.0 BILLION  OF DEBT, AND IN JUNE 2019, WE REPAID  $1.0 BILLION  OF DEBT AT MATURITY. NOTES 5 AND 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  WE HAVE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY THROUGH A COMMITTED $2.5 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OBTAINED THROUGH A GROUP OF BANKS. IN OCTOBER 2018, WE EXTENDED THIS CREDIT FACILITY BY ONE YEAR TO OCTOBER 2023. NO BALANCES WERE OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME DURING  2019  OR  2018.  MOST OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS CONTAIN COVENANTS RELATED TO SECURED DEBT LEVELS. IN ADDITION TO A SECURED DEBT LEVEL COVENANT, OUR CREDIT FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS A DEBT LEVERAGE COVENANT. WE ARE, AND EXPECT TO REMAIN, IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF  AUGUST 3, 2019  , NO NOTES OR DEBENTURES CONTAINED PROVISIONS REQUIRING ACCELERATION OF PAYMENT UPON A CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE, EXCEPT THAT CERTAIN OUTSTANDING NOTES ALLOW THE NOTE HOLDERS TO PUT THE NOTES TO US IF WITHIN A MATTER OF MONTHS OF EACH OTHER WE EXPERIENCE BOTH (I) A CHANGE IN CONTROL; AND (II) OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ARE EITHER REDUCED AND THE RESULTING RATING IS NONINVESTMENT GRADE, OR OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ARE PLACED ON WATCH FOR POSSIBLE REDUCTION AND THOSE RATINGS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REDUCED AND THE RESULTING RATING IS NONINVESTMENT GRADE.  WE BELIEVE OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE ADEQUATE TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS, FINANCE ANTICIPATED EXPANSION AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, FUND DEBT MATURITIES, PAY DIVIDENDS, AND EXECUTE PURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE CONTINUE TO ANTICIPATE AMPLE ACCESS TO COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM FINANCING.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, OTHER THAN THE NEW BORROWINGS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS SINCE  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , AS REPORTED IN OUR  2018  FORM 10-K.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  THIS REPORT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY ACCOMPANIED BY THE WORDS \u201cEXPECT,\u201d \u201cMAY,\u201d \u201cCOULD,\u201d \u201cBELIEVE,\u201d \u201cWOULD,\u201d \u201cMIGHT,\u201d \u201cANTICIPATES,\u201d OR SIMILAR WORDS. THE PRINCIPAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT INCLUDE: OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, STATEMENTS REGARDING THE ADEQUACY OF AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, THE FUNDING OF DEBT MATURITIES, THE CONTINUED EXECUTION OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, OUR EXPECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND NEW LEASE COMMITMENTS, THE EXPECTED COMPLIANCE WITH DEBT COVENANTS, THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, OUR INTENTIONS REGARDING FUTURE DIVIDENDS, THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF, AND ADEQUACY OF OUR RESERVES FOR, CLAIMS, LITIGATION AND THE RESOLUTION OF TAX MATTERS, THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS.  ALL SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE INTENDED TO ENJOY THE PROTECTION OF THE SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995, AS AMENDED. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THERE IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT. THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SET FORTH ON OUR DESCRIPTION OF RISK FACTORS IN ITEM 1A OF OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , WHICH SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE MADE, AND WE DO NOT UNDERTAKE ANY OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "TARGET CORP", "CIK": 27419, "Date": "2019-08-30T00:00:00", "Ticker": "TGT", "Name": "Target Corp", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 5331.0, "Business": "MN", "Incorporated": "MN", "IRS": 410215170.0, "key": "20190830TGT", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": -0.3082959641255722, "labelr3": 0.6091275419360939, "labelr4": 1.0991058122205726, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.49095106, "prof1": 0.50904894, "return1&2": 0.9969170403587444, "return1&2&3": 1.0029895366218236, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0140134529147982, "return2": 0.9969170403587444, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 1.006091275419361, "return4": 1.0109910581222057, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.08407852264869622, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": -0.0, "indexx": 2363, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0, "cumreturn1b": 0.7187755673615942, "cumreturndow": 0.9908245989725446, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9932235722292855}]}}, {"mode": "vega-lite"});

DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE TIMING OR AMOUNTS OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.

(4)  THE FIVE LARGEST COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURES, COMBINED, FOR THIS CATEGORY REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 2% OF THE TOTAL NET CREDIT EXPOSURE.  INVESTING CASH FLOWS  NET CASH USED IN DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $403 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH AND RESTRICTED CASH ACQUIRED IN THE SCANA COMBINATION AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF BLUE RACER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PLANT CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER PROPERTY ADDITIONS.  FINANCING CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY  DOMINION ENERGY RELIES ON CAPITAL MARKETS AS SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS NOT SATISFIED BY CASH PROVIDED BY ITS OPERATIONS. AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN  CREDIT RATINGS  AND  DEBT COVENANTS  IN MD&A IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE ABILITY TO BORROW FUNDS OR ISSUE SECURITIES AND THE RETURN DEMANDED BY INVESTORS ARE AFFECTED BY CREDIT RATINGS. IN ADDITION, THE RAISING OF EXTERNAL CAPITAL IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING REGISTRATION WITH THE SEC FOR CERTAIN ISSUANCES.  DOMINION ENERGY CURRENTLY MEETS THE DEFINITION OF A WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER UNDER SEC RULES GOVERNING THE REGISTRATION, COMMUNICATIONS AND OFFERING PROCESSES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. THE RULES PROVIDE FOR A STREAMLINED SHELF REGISTRATION PROCESS TO PROVIDE REGISTRANTS WITH TIMELY ACCESS TO CAPITAL. THIS ALLOWS DOMINION ENERGY TO USE AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENTS TO REGISTER ANY OFFERING OF SECURITIES, OTHER THAN THOSE FOR EXCHANGE OFFERS OR BUSINESS COMBINATION TRANSACTIONS.  NET CASH USED BY DOMINION ENERGY'S FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $291 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET DEBT REPAYMENTS IN 2019 COMPARED TO NET DEBT ISSUANCES IN 2018, LOWER ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK AND HIGHER COMMON DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2019 EQUITY UNITS.  IN NOVEMBER 2017, DOMINION ENERGY FILED AN SEC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SALE OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF VARIABLE DENOMINATION FLOATING RATE DEMAND NOTES, CALLED DOMINION ENERGY RELIABILITY INVESTMENT  SM  . THE REGISTRATION LIMITS THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT THAT MAY BE OUTSTANDING AT ANY ONE TIME TO $1.0 BILLION. THE NOTES ARE OFFERED ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS AND BEAR INTEREST AT A FLOATING RATE PER ANNUM DETERMINED BY THE DOMINION ENERGY RELIABILITY INVESTMENT COMMITTEE, OR ITS DESIGNEE, ON A WEEKLY BASIS. THE NOTES HAVE NO STATED MATURITY DATE, ARE NON-TRANSFERABLE AND MAY BE REDEEMED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY DOMINION ENERGY OR AT THE INVESTOR\u2019S OPTION AT ANY TIME. THE BALANCE AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 WAS $21 MILLION. THE NOTES ARE SHORT-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS ON DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE PROCEEDS WILL BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES AND TO REPAY DEBT.  116  IN JANUARY 2019, DOMINION ENERGY ACQUIRED ALL OUTSTANDING PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS OF DOMINION ENERGY MIDSTREAM NOT OWNED BY DOMINION ENERGY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF 22.5 MILLION COMMON SHARES. SEE NOTE 1  7  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

STATES WITHIN THE OZONE TRANSPORT REGION, INCLUDING STATES IN WHICH DOMINION ENERGY HAS NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS, ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP REASONABLY ACHIEVABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY RULES FOR EXISTING SOURCES BASED ON THE OZONE TRANSPORT COMMISSION MODEL RULE. STATES OUTSIDE OF THE OZONE TRANSPORT COMMISSION MAY ALSO CONSIDER THE MODEL RULES IN SETTING NEW REASONABLY ACHIEVABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS.  IN MAY 2019, VDEQ ISSUED A FINAL RULE ESTABLISHING A STATE CARBON REGULATION PROGRAM. SEVERAL OTHER STATES IN WHICH DOMINION ENERGY OPERATES, INCLUDING PENNSYLVANIA, NEW YORK, MARYLAND AND OHIO ARE DEVELOPING OR HAVE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO DEVELOP STATE SPECIFIC REGULATIONS TO CONTROL GHG EMISSIONS, INCLUDING METHANE.  DOMINION ENERGY CANNOT CURRENTLY ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACTS RELATED TO THESE MATTERS, BUT THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL IMPACT TO ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND/OR CASH FLOWS.

ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE IS FOCUSED ON CONSTRUCTING AN APPROXIMATELY 600-MILE NATURAL GAS PIPELINE RUNNING FROM WEST VIRGINIA THROUGH VIRGINIA TO NORTH CAROLINA. DURING THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2018, A FERC STOP WORK ORDER TOGETHER WITH DELAYS IN OBTAINING PERMITS NECESSARY FOR CONSTRUCTION AND DELAYS IN CONSTRUCTION DUE TO JUDICIAL ACTIONS IMPACTED THE COST AND SCHEDULE FOR THE PROJECT.  AS A RESULT, PROJECT COST ESTIMATES HAVE INCREASED FROM BETWEEN $6.0 BILLION TO $6.5 BILLION TO BETWEEN $7.0 BILLION TO $7.5 BILLION, EXCLUDING FINANCING COSTS. ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE A LATE 2020 IN-SERVICE DATE FOR AT LEAST KEY SEGMENTS OF THE PROJECT, WHILE THE REMAINDER MAY EXTEND INTO EARLY 2021. ALTERNATIVELY, IF IT TAKES LONGER TO RESOLVE THE JUDICIAL ISSUES, SUCH AS THROUGH RESOLUTION OF THE APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE U.S. FILED IN JUNE 2019, FULL IN-SERVICE COULD EXTEND TO THE END OF 2021 WITH TOTAL PROJECT COST ESTIMATED TO INCREASE AN ADDITIONAL $250 MILLION, RESULTING IN TOTAL PROJECT COST ESTIMATES OF $7.25 BILLION TO $7.75 BILLION, EXCLUDING FINANCING COSTS. ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE IS ALSO EVALUATING POSSIBLE LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES.  PROJECT CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES, SCHEDULES AND COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY DUE TO PERMITTING AND/OR WORK DELAYS (INCLUDING DUE TO JUDICIAL OR REGULATORY ACTION), ABNORMAL WEATHER AND OTHER CONDITIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN COST OR SCHEDULE MODIFICATIONS IN THE FUTURE, A SUSPENSION OF AFUDC FOR ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE AND/OR IMPAIRMENT CHARGES POTENTIALLY MATERIAL TO DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S CASH FLOWS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  118", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "DOMINION ENERGY INC /VA/", "CIK": 715957, "Date": "2019-08-01T00:00:00", "Ticker": "D", "Name": "Dominion Resources Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 4911.0, "Business": "VA", "Incorporated": "VA", "IRS": 541229715.0, "key": "20190801D", "labelr1": 0.14490844421024826, "labelr2": -1.7758484609313263, "labelr3": 0.7365742600776712, "labelr4": -1.050252592395629, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.520967, "prof1": 0.479033, "return1&2": 1.0162836666234485, "return1&2&3": 1.0087979827257263, "return1&2&3&4": 1.019392909691338, "return2": 1.0177584846093133, "return1": 0.9985509155578975, "return3": 0.9926342573992232, "return4": 1.0105025259239564, "1_day_return": 0.1449084442102455, "cumulative_return1": 1.3794441113912808, "cumulative_return1&2": 3.44347226151521, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 19.725641751048414, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 209.61290997128623, "indexx": 1576, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9819144166176678, "cumreturn1b": 0.9819144166176678, "cumreturndow": 0.9927172599946105, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9962980626161437}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1650, "level_0": 1696, "index": 11180, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-Q, AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND RISK FACTORS CONTAINED IN THE FORM 10-K. WE INTEND FOR THIS DISCUSSION TO PROVIDE THE READER WITH INFORMATION THAT WILL ASSIST IN UNDERSTANDING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE CHANGES IN CERTAIN KEY ITEMS IN THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT ACCOUNTED FOR THOSE CHANGES, AS WELL AS HOW CERTAIN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE DISCUSSION ALSO PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS TO PROVIDE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THOSE SEGMENTS AND THEIR RESULTS AFFECT THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF AMEREN AS A WHOLE. ALSO SEE THE GLOSSARY OF TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONS AT THE FRONT OF THIS REPORT AND IN THE FORM 10-K.  39  AMEREN, HEADQUARTERED IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI, IS A PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY WHOSE PRIMARY ASSETS ARE ITS EQUITY INTERESTS IN ITS SUBSIDIARIES. AMEREN\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES ARE SEPARATE, INDEPENDENT LEGAL ENTITIES WITH SEPARATE BUSINESSES, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES. DIVIDENDS ON AMEREN\u2019S COMMON STOCK AND THE PAYMENT OF EXPENSES BY AMEREN DEPEND ON DISTRIBUTIONS MADE TO IT BY ITS SUBSIDIARIES. AMEREN\u2019S PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE LISTED BELOW. AMEREN HAS OTHER SUBSIDIARIES THAT CONDUCT OTHER ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS PROVIDING SHARED SERVICES.  \u2022  UNION ELECTRIC COMPANY, DOING BUSINESS AS AMEREN MISSOURI, OPERATES A RATE-REGULATED ELECTRIC GENERATION, TRANSMISSION, AND DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS AND A RATE-REGULATED NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS IN MISSOURI.  \u2022  AMEREN ILLINOIS COMPANY, DOING BUSINESS AS AMEREN ILLINOIS, OPERATES RATE-REGULATED ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION, ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION, AND NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES IN ILLINOIS.  \u2022  ATXI OPERATES A FERC RATE-REGULATED ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION BUSINESS. ATXI PLACED THE SPOON RIVER PROJECT IN SERVICE IN FEBRUARY 2018, AND IS DEVELOPING THE MISO-APPROVED ILLINOIS RIVERS AND MARK TWAIN ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION PROJECTS.  AMEREN\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AND THEREFORE INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF ITS MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. ALL INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS HAVE NO SUBSIDIARIES. ALL TABULAR DOLLAR AMOUNTS ARE IN MILLIONS, UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED.  IN ADDITION TO PRESENTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND EARNINGS AMOUNTS IN TOTAL, WE PRESENT CERTAIN INFORMATION IN CENTS PER SHARE. THESE AMOUNTS REFLECT FACTORS THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT AMEREN\u2019S EARNINGS. WE BELIEVE THIS PER SHARE INFORMATION HELPS READERS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS ON AMEREN\u2019S EARNINGS PER SHARE.  OVERVIEW  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO AMEREN COMMON SHAREHOLDERS IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WAS $179 MILLION  , OR  72  CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED WITH $239 MILLION  , OR  97  CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO AMEREN COMMON SHAREHOLDERS IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WAS $370 MILLION  , OR $1.50  PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED WITH $390 MILLION  , OR $1.59  PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD. NET INCOME FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE YEAR-AGO PERIODS, WAS UNFAVORABLY AFFECTED BY MILDER EARLY SUMMER TEMPERATURES EXPERIENCED IN 2019 AND INCREASED OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE CALLAWAY ENERGY CENTER\u2019S SCHEDULED REFUELING AND MAINTENANCE OUTAGE THAT WAS COMPLETED IN MAY 2019, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE BENEFIT OF INCREASED INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AT AMEREN TRANSMISSION AND AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION, EACH OF WHICH BENEFITS FROM FORMULAIC RATEMAKING. NET INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD, WAS ALSO FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY TIMING DIFFERENCES IN 2018 BETWEEN INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND REVENUE REDUCTIONS RELATED TO FEDERAL TAX REFORM, WHICH WILL AFFECT 2019 QUARTERLY EARNINGS COMPARISONS BUT IS NOT EXPECTED TO AFFECT THE FULL-YEAR COMPARISON. NET INCOME FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD, WAS ALSO FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY MEEIA PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES AND INCREASED EARNINGS AT AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS AS A RESULT OF HIGHER DELIVERY SERVICE RATES AND A CHANGE IN RATE DESIGN, WHICH CONCENTRATES MORE REVENUES IN THE WINTER HEATING SEASON DUE TO AN INCREASE IN VOLUMETRIC RATES BUT DOES NOT AFFECT FULL-YEAR EARNINGS COMPARISONS.  AMEREN\u2019S STRATEGIC PLAN INCLUDES INVESTING IN, AND OPERATING ITS UTILITIES IN, A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS, ENHANCING THOSE FRAMEWORKS, AND ADVOCATING FOR RESPONSIBLE ENERGY AND ECONOMIC POLICIES, AS WELL AS CREATING AND CAPITALIZING ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTMENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS. AMEREN REMAINS FOCUSED ON DISCIPLINED COST MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGIC CAPITAL ALLOCATION. AMEREN BELIEVES IT HAS CONSTRUCTIVE REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS FOR INVESTMENT AT ALL OF ITS UTILITY BUSINESSES AND INVESTED OVER  $1.1 BILLION  IN THOSE BUSINESSES IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI ANNOUNCED ITS SMART ENERGY PLAN, WHICH INCLUDES A FIVE-YEAR CAPITAL INVESTMENT OVERVIEW WITH A DETAILED ONE-YEAR PLAN FOR 2019. THE PLAN IS DESIGNED TO UPGRADE AMEREN MISSOURI'S ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND INCLUDES INVESTMENTS THAT WILL UPGRADE THE GRID AND ACCOMMODATE MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY. INVESTMENTS UNDER THE PLAN ARE EXPECTED TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $6.3 BILLION OVER THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD FROM 2019 THROUGH 2023, WITH COSTS LARGELY RECOVERABLE UNDER PISA AND, FOR THE PORTION OF WIND AND OTHER RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT RECOVERABLE UNDER PISA, RECOVERABLE UNDER THE RESRAM. AS A PART OF ITS SMART ENERGY PLAN, IN AUGUST 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS TO FILE FOR CERTIFICATES OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY WITH THE MOPSC TO BUILD THREE SOLAR FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF MISSOURI. EACH 10 MEGAWATT SOLAR ENERGY GENERATION FACILITY WILL CONNECT TO BATTERY STORAGE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE SYSTEM RELIABILITY. ALL THREE FACILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2020.  IN MARCH 2019, AMEREN ISSUED ITS BUILDING A CLEANER ENERGY FUTURE REPORT, WHICH SETS FORTH AMEREN'S PLAN FOR REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS AND ADDRESSING CLIMATE RISK. THE PLAN IS LARGELY REFLECTED IN THE AMEREN MISSOURI 2017 IRP, WHICH INCLUDES EXPANDING RENEWABLE SOURCES BY ADDING 700 MEGAWATTS OF WIND GENERATION BY THE END OF 2020 AND ADDING 100 MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR GENERATION BY 2027.  IN MAY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI ENTERED INTO A BUILD-TRANSFER AGREEMENT WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF ENEL GREEN POWER NORTH AMERICA, INC. TO ACQUIRE, AFTER CONSTRUCTION, AN UP-TO 300-MEGAWATT WIND GENERATION FACILITY TO BE LOCATED IN NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI. AMEREN MISSOURI FILED FOR A CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY WITH THE MOPSC IN MAY 2019.  IN JULY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI, THE MOPSC STAFF, AND CERTAIN INTERVENORS FILED A NONUNANIMOUS STIPULATION AND AGREEMENT WITH THE MOPSC REGARDING THE REQUESTED CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND  40  NECESSITY.  FINAL RTO INTERCONNECTION COSTS WERE DETERMINED IN JULY 2019, AND A RELATED RTO TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT IS EXPECTED BY THE FALL OF 2019.  IN 2018, AMEREN MISSOURI ENTERED INTO A BUILD-TRANSFER AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE, AFTER CONSTRUCTION, AN UP-TO  400  -MEGAWATT WIND GENERATION FACILITY.  FINAL MISO INTERCONNECTION COSTS FOR THE FACILITY WERE DETERMINED IN JULY 2019, AND A RELATED TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT WITH THE MISO IS EXPECTED BY THE FALL OF 2019.  BOTH FACILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2020, WHICH WOULD SUPPORT AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S COMPLIANCE WITH THE MISSOURI RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARD.  BOTH ACQUISITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF A CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY BY THE MOPSC AND OBTAINING FERC APPROVAL FOR THE 300-MEGAWATT FACILITY, ENTERING INTO AN RTO TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST FOR EACH FACILITY, AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  THE TWO BUILD-TRANSFER AGREEMENTS COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY  $1.2 BILLION  OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EXPECTED IN 2020.  THE MOPSC HAS APPROVED A RESRAM, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF REGULATORY LAG FOR THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARDS, INCLUDING RECOVERY OF INVESTMENTS IN WIND AND OTHER RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION, BY PROVIDING MORE TIMELY RECOVERY OF COSTS AND A RETURN ON INVESTMENTS NOT ALREADY PROVIDED FOR IN CUSTOMER RATES OR RECOVERED UNDER PISA.  SEE NOTE 2 \u2013 RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, OF THIS REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING AMEREN MISSOURI WIND GENERATION FACILITIES.  IN 2018, AMEREN MISSOURI ENTERED INTO A BUILD-TRANSFER AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE, AFTER CONSTRUCTION, A  157-  MEGAWATT WIND GENERATION FACILITY. IN JULY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI AND THE DEVELOPER MUTUALLY AGREED TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT DUE TO UNACCEPTABLE INTERCONNECTION COSTS, WHICH MADE THE PROJECT UNECONOMIC AND NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S CUSTOMERS.  IN DECEMBER 2018, AMEREN MISSOURI FILED A REQUEST WITH THE MOPSC TO INCREASE ITS ANNUAL REVENUES FOR NATURAL GAS DELIVERY SERVICE.  IN JULY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI, THE MOPSC STAFF, AND CERTAIN INTERVENORS FILED A NONUNANIMOUS STIPULATION AND AGREEMENT WITH THE MOPSC TO DECREASE AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ANNUAL REVENUES FOR NATURAL GAS DELIVERY SERVICE BY  $1 MILLION.  THE REMAINING INTERVENORS TO THE REGULATORY RATE REVIEW DID NOT OBJECT TO THE AGREEMENT.  THE REQUESTED DECREASE IN ANNUAL RATES IS BASED ON A RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY RANGE OF  9.4%  TO  9.95%  AND A CAPITAL STRUCTURE COMPOSED  OF  52.0%  COMMON EQUITY, WHICH WAS AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S CAPITAL STRUCTURE AS OF MAY 31, 2019. THIS AGREEMENT ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF ISRS, WHICH WILL BE CALCULATED USING AN ROE OF  9.725%.  THE AGREEMENT REPRESENTS A  $1 MILLION  INCREASE TO AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ANNUAL REVENUES FOR NATURAL GAS DELIVERY SERVICE FROM INTERIM RATES, WHICH WERE APPROVED BY THE MOPSC IN DECEMBER 2018.  A DECISION BY THE MOPSC IS EXPECTED IN AUGUST 2019, WITH NEW RATES EXPECTED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SEPTEMBER 2019.  IN JULY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI FILED A REQUEST WITH THE MOPSC SEEKING APPROVAL TO DECREASE ITS ANNUAL REVENUES FOR ELECTRIC SERVICE BY  $1 MILLION.  THE ELECTRIC RATE DECREASE REQUEST IS BASED ON A  9.95%  RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY, A CAPITAL STRUCTURE COMPOSED OF  51.9%  COMMON EQUITY, A RATE BASE OF  $8.0 BILLION  ,  AND A TEST YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WITH CERTAIN PRO-FORMA ADJUSTMENTS EXPECTED THROUGH AN ANTICIPATED TRUE-UP DATE OF DECEMBER 31, 2019. PRO-FORMA ADJUSTMENTS ARE ALSO EXPECTED FOR FUEL COSTS, TRANSPORTATION COSTS, MISO MULTI-VALUE TRANSMISSION PROJECT EXPENSES, AND PAYROLL COSTS EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2020.  THE MOPSC PROCEEDING RELATING TO THE PROPOSED ELECTRIC SERVICE RATE CHANGES WILL TAKE PLACE OVER A PERIOD OF UP TO  11  MONTHS, WITH A DECISION BY THE MOPSC EXPECTED BY LATE APRIL 2020 AND NEW RATES EFFECTIVE BY LATE MAY 2020.  SEE NOTE 2 \u2013 RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  IN APRIL 2019, AMEREN ILLINOIS FILED ITS ANNUAL ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE FORMULA RATE UPDATE TO ESTABLISH THE REVENUE REQUIREMENT TO BE USED FOR 2020 RATES WITH THE ICC. PENDING ICC APPROVAL, THIS UPDATE FILING WILL RESULT IN A  $7 MILLION  DECREASE IN AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE RATES, BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2020.  THIS UPDATE REFLECTS AN INCREASE TO THE ANNUAL FORMULA RATE BASED ON 2018 ACTUAL COSTS AND EXPECTED NET PLANT ADDITIONS FOR 2019, AND AN INCREASE TO INCLUDE THE 2018 REVENUE REQUIREMENT RECONCILIATION ADJUSTMENT. IT ALSO REFLECTS A DECREASE FOR THE CONCLUSION OF THE 2017 REVENUE REQUIREMENT RECONCILIATION ADJUSTMENT, WHICH WILL BE FULLY COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS IN 2019, CONSISTENT WITH THE ICC\u2019S NOVEMBER 2018 ANNUAL UPDATE FILING ORDER. IN JUNE 2019, THE ICC STAFF SUBMITTED ITS CALCULATION OF THE REVENUE REQUIREMENT INCLUDED IN AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 UPDATE FILING, RECOMMENDING AN AMOUNT COMPARABLE TO AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 FILING. AN ICC DECISION IN THIS PROCEEDING IS EXPECTED BY DECEMBER 2019.  ATXI CONTINUES TO MAKE PROGRESS WITH CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES FOR ITS TWO MISO-APPROVED MULTI-VALUE PROJECTS THAT ARE STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION: THE ILLINOIS RIVERS AND MARK TWAIN PROJECTS.  CONSTRUCTION OF THE ILLINOIS RIVERS PROJECT IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE, WITH THE LAST SECTION EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 2020, PENDING THE OUTCOME OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  IN JUNE 2019, A SECTION OF THE MARK TWAIN PROJECT WAS COMPLETED FROM KIRKSVILLE, MISSOURI TO THE IOWA BORDER, AND THE REMAINING SECTION IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2019.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION ARE AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ENERGY-EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS BY OUR CUSTOMERS AND BY US, AND THE ACTIONS OF KEY CUSTOMERS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES. AMEREN AND AMEREN MISSOURI RESULTS ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN WINTER HEATING AND SUMMER COOLING DEMANDS, AS WELL AS BY NUCLEAR REFUELING AND OTHER ENERGY CENTER MAINTENANCE OUTAGES. ADDITIONALLY, FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES AND CONDITIONS IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS AFFECT OUR COST OF BORROWING AND OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS COSTS. ALMOST ALL OF AMEREN\u2019S REVENUES ARE SUBJECT TO STATE OR FEDERAL REGULATION.  41  THIS REGULATION HAS A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE PRICES WE CHARGE FOR OUR SERVICES. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND LIQUIDITY ARE AFFECTED BY OUR ABILITY TO ALIGN OUR OVERALL SPENDING, BOTH OPERATING AND CAPITAL, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORKS ESTABLISHED BY OUR REGULATORS.  AMEREN MISSOURI PRINCIPALLY USES COAL AND ENRICHED URANIUM FOR FUEL IN ITS ELECTRIC OPERATIONS AND PURCHASES NATURAL GAS FOR ITS CUSTOMERS. AMEREN ILLINOIS PURCHASES POWER AND NATURAL GAS FOR ITS CUSTOMERS. THE PRICES FOR THESE COMMODITIES CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, WEATHER, SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND MANY OTHER FACTORS. AS DESCRIBED BELOW, WE HAVE NATURAL GAS COST RECOVERY MECHANISMS FOR OUR ILLINOIS AND MISSOURI NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES, A PURCHASED POWER COST RECOVERY MECHANISM FOR AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS, AND A FAC FOR AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ELECTRIC BUSINESS.  AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ELECTRIC SERVICE AND NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICE RATES ARE ESTABLISHED IN A TRADITIONAL REGULATORY RATE REVIEW BASED ON A HISTORICAL TEST YEAR AND AN ALLOWED RETURN ON EQUITY. TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF REGULATORY LAG, AMEREN MISSOURI HAS RECOVERY MECHANISMS IN PLACE FOR CERTAIN COSTS THAT ALLOW CUSTOMER RATES TO BE ADJUSTED WITHOUT A TRADITIONAL REGULATORY RATE REVIEW. AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S FAC COST RECOVERY MECHANISM ALLOWS IT TO RECOVER OR REFUND, THROUGH CUSTOMER RATES, 95% OF THE VARIANCE IN NET ENERGY COSTS FROM THE AMOUNT SET IN BASE RATES WITHOUT A TRADITIONAL REGULATORY RATE REVIEW, SUBJECT TO MOPSC PRUDENCE REVIEWS, WITH THE REMAINING 5% OF CHANGES RETAINED BY AMEREN MISSOURI. NET RECOVERY OF THESE COSTS THROUGH CUSTOMER RATES DOES NOT AFFECT AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ELECTRIC MARGINS, AS ANY CHANGE IN REVENUE IS OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN FUEL EXPENSE. IN ADDITION, AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S MEEIA CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAM COSTS, THE RELATED LOST ELECTRIC MARGINS, AND ANY PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE ARE RECOVERABLE THROUGH THE MEEIA COST RECOVERY MECHANISM WITHOUT A TRADITIONAL REGULATORY RATE REVIEW. AMEREN MISSOURI ALSO HAS A COST RECOVERY MECHANISM FOR NATURAL GAS PURCHASED ON BEHALF OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THESE PASS-THROUGH PURCHASED GAS COSTS DO NOT AFFECT AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S NATURAL GAS MARGINS, AS ANY CHANGE IN COSTS IS OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN REVENUES. AMEREN MISSOURI EMPLOYS OTHER COST RECOVERY MECHANISMS, INCLUDING A PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST TRACKER, AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION TRACKER, A TRACKER ON CERTAIN EXCESS DEFERRED TAXES, A RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARDS COST TRACKER, AND A SOLAR REBATE PROGRAM TRACKER. EACH OF THESE TRACKERS ALLOWS AMEREN MISSOURI TO DEFER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED AND COSTS INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER RATES AS A REGULATORY ASSET OR REGULATORY LIABILITY. THE DIFFERENCE WILL BE REFLECTED IN BASE RATES IN A SUBSEQUENT MOPSC RATE ORDER.  PURSUANT TO ITS PISA ELECTION, AMEREN MISSOURI IS PERMITTED TO DEFER AND RECOVER 85% OF THE DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL RETURN ON RATE BASE ON CERTAIN PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT PLACED IN SERVICE AFTER SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, AND NOT INCLUDED IN BASE RATES. ACCUMULATED PISA DEFERRALS EARN CARRYING COSTS AT THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, WITH ALL APPROVED PISA DEFERRALS ADDED TO RATE BASE PROSPECTIVELY AND RECOVERED OVER A PERIOD OF 20 YEARS FOLLOWING A REGULATORY RATE REVIEW. ADDITIONALLY, UNDER THE RESRAM, AMEREN MISSOURI IS PERMITTED TO RECOVER THE 15% OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL RETURN FOR RENEWABLE GENERATION PLANT PLACED IN SERVICE AND NOT RECOVERED UNDER PISA. ACCUMULATED RESRAM DEFERRALS EARN CARRYING COSTS AT SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES. PISA AND THE RESRAM MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF REGULATORY LAG BETWEEN REGULATORY RATE REVIEWS. THOSE INVESTMENTS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RECOVERY UNDER PISA AND THE REMAINING  15% OF CERTAIN PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT PLACED IN SERVICE, UNLESS ELIGIBLE FOR RECOVERY UNDER THE RESRAM, REMAIN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY LAG. AMEREN MISSOURI RECOGNIZES THE COST OF DEBT ON PISA DEFERRALS IN REVENUE, INSTEAD OF USING THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY, WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY BE RECOGNIZED IN REVENUES WHEN RECOVERY OF SUCH DEFERRALS ARE REFLECTED IN CUSTOMER RATES.  IN JANUARY 2019, THE MOOPC FILED AN APPEAL WITH THE MISSOURI COURT OF APPEALS, WESTERN DISTRICT, CHALLENGING THE MOPSC\u2019S DECEMBER 2018 ORDER ALLOWING AMEREN MISSOURI TO RECOVER, THROUGH THE RESRAM, THE 15% OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL RETURN NOT RECOVERED UNDER PISA FOR RENEWABLE GENERATION. SEE NOTE 2 \u2013 RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE RATES ARE RECONCILED ANNUALLY TO ITS ACTUAL REVENUE REQUIREMENT, YEAR-END RATE BASE AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE, AND ALLOWED RETURN ON EQUITY, UNDER A FORMULA RATEMAKING PROCESS, EFFECTIVE THROUGH 2022. IF A GIVEN YEAR\u2019S REVENUE REQUIREMENT VARIES FROM THE AMOUNT COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS, AN ADJUSTMENT IS MADE TO ELECTRIC OPERATING REVENUES WITH AN OFFSET TO A REGULATORY ASSET OR LIABILITY TO REFLECT THAT YEAR\u2019S ACTUAL REVENUE REQUIREMENT, INDEPENDENT OF ACTUAL SALES VOLUMES. THE REGULATORY BALANCE IS THEN COLLECTED FROM, OR REFUNDED TO, CUSTOMERS WITHIN TWO YEARS FROM THE END OF THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY RIDER PROVIDES AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE BUSINESS WITH RECOVERY OF, AND RETURN ON, ENERGY-EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS. UNDER FORMULA RATEMAKING FOR BOTH ITS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE AND ITS ELECTRIC ENERGY-EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS, THE REVENUE REQUIREMENTS ARE BASED ON RECOVERABLE COSTS, YEAR-END RATE BASE, A CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF 50% COMMON EQUITY, AND A RETURN ON EQUITY. THE RETURN ON EQUITY COMPONENT IS EQUAL TO THE ANNUAL AVERAGE OF THE MONTHLY YIELDS OF THE 30-YEAR UNITED STATES TREASURY BONDS PLUS 580 BASIS POINTS. THEREFORE, AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ANNUAL RETURN ON EQUITY FOR ITS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS IS DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO THE YIELDS ON SUCH BONDS.  AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICE RATES ARE ESTABLISHED IN A TRADITIONAL REGULATORY RATE REVIEW BASED ON A FUTURE TEST YEAR AND ALLOWED RETURN ON EQUITY. AMEREN ILLINOIS EMPLOYS A VBA TO ENSURE RECOVERABILITY OF THE NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICE REVENUE REQUIREMENT FOR RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL NONRESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS THAT IS DEPENDENT ON SALES VOLUMES. FOR THESE RATE CLASSES, THE VBA ALLOWS AMEREN ILLINOIS TO ADJUST NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICE RATES WITHOUT A TRADITIONAL REGULATORY RATE REVIEW WHEN CHANGES OCCUR IN SALES VOLUMES FROM NORMALIZED SALES VOLUMES APPROVED BY THE ICC IN A PREVIOUS REGULATORY RATE REVIEW. IN ADDITION, THE QIP RIDER PROVIDES AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 NATURAL GAS BUSINESS WITH RECOVERY OF, AND A RETURN ON, QUALIFYING INFRASTRUCTURE PLANT INVESTMENTS THAT ARE PLACED IN SERVICE BETWEEN REGULATORY RATE REVIEWS.  42  AMEREN ILLINOIS ALSO HAS RECOVERY MECHANISMS IN PLACE FOR CERTAIN COSTS THAT ALLOW CUSTOMER RATES TO BE ADJUSTED WITHOUT A TRADITIONAL REGULATORY RATE REVIEW. AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE BUSINESS HAS COST RECOVERY MECHANISMS FOR POWER PURCHASED AND TRANSMISSION SERVICES INCURRED ON BEHALF OF ITS CUSTOMERS, RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDIT COMPLIANCE, AND ZERO EMISSION CREDITS. AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 NATURAL GAS BUSINESS HAS A COST RECOVERY MECHANISM FOR NATURAL GAS PURCHASED ON BEHALF OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THESE PASS-THROUGH COSTS DO NOT AFFECT AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC OR NATURAL GAS MARGINS, AS ANY CHANGE IN COSTS IS OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN REVENUES. AMEREN ILLINOIS EMPLOYS OTHER COST RECOVERY MECHANISMS FOR NATURAL GAS CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAM COSTS AND CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS, AS WELL AS BAD DEBT EXPENSES AND COSTS OF CERTAIN ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS NOT RECOVERED IN BASE RATES.  FERC\u2019S ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION FORMULA RATE FRAMEWORK PROVIDES FOR AN ANNUAL RECONCILIATION OF THE ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SERVICE REVENUE REQUIREMENT, WHICH REFLECTS THE ACTUAL RECOVERABLE COSTS INCURRED AND THE 13-MONTH AVERAGE RATE BASE FOR A GIVEN YEAR, WITH THE REVENUE REQUIREMENT IN CUSTOMER RATES, INCLUDING AN ALLOWED RETURN ON EQUITY. AMEREN ILLINOIS AND ATXI USE A COMPANY-SPECIFIC, FORWARD-LOOKING FORMULA RATEMAKING FRAMEWORK IN SETTING THEIR TRANSMISSION RATES. THESE RATES ARE UPDATED EACH JANUARY WITH FORECASTED INFORMATION. IF A GIVEN YEAR\u2019S REVENUE REQUIREMENT VARIES FROM THE AMOUNT COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS, AN ADJUSTMENT IS MADE TO ELECTRIC OPERATING REVENUES WITH AN OFFSET TO A REGULATORY ASSET OR LIABILITY TO REFLECT THAT YEAR\u2019S ACTUAL REVENUE REQUIREMENT. THE REGULATORY BALANCE IS COLLECTED FROM, OR REFUNDED TO, CUSTOMERS WITHIN TWO YEARS FROM THE END OF THE YEAR. THE TOTAL RETURN ON EQUITY CURRENTLY ALLOWED FOR AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 AND ATXI\u2019S ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SERVICE BUSINESSES IS 10.82% AND IS SUBJECT TO A FERC COMPLAINT CASE. SEE NOTE 2 \u2013 RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  WE EMPLOY VARIOUS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY RISK AND OTHER RISKS INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESS. THE RELIABILITY OF AMEREN MISSOURI'S ENERGY CENTERS AND OUR TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS AND THE LEVEL AND TIMING OF OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS AND CAPITAL INVESTMENT ARE KEY FACTORS THAT WE SEEK TO MANAGE IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND LIQUIDITY.  EARNINGS SUMMARY  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A SUMMARY OF AMEREN\u2019S EARNINGS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  .  THREE MONTHS  SIX MONTHS  2019  2018  2019  2018  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO AMEREN COMMON SHAREHOLDERS  $179  $239  $370  $390  EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE  \u2013  DILUTED  0.72  0.97  1.50  1.59  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO AMEREN COMMON SHAREHOLDERS DECREASED $60 MILLION  , OR  25 CENT  S PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD. THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO NET INCOME DECREASES OF $61 MILLION  AND $6 MILLION  AT AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS, RESPECTIVELY, AND AN INCREASE IN NET LOSS OF $3 MILLION  FOR ACTIVITY NOT REPORTED AS PART OF A SEGMENT, PRIMARILY AT AMEREN (PARENT). THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET INCOME INCREASES OF $6 MILLION  AND $4 MILLION  AT AMEREN TRANSMISSION AND AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION, RESPECTIVELY.

SEE NOTE 2 \u2013 RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE MEEIA 2013 AND MEEIA 2016 PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES.  \u2022  EXCLUDING THE ESTIMATED EFFECTS OF WEATHER AND THE MEEIA 2016 AND 2019 CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS, ELECTRIC REVENUES INCREASED AN ESTIMATED  $6 MILLION  AND  $13 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES VOLUMES FROM GROWTH AND AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE RETAIL PRICE PER KILOWATTHOUR DUE TO CHANGES IN CUSTOMER USAGE PATTERNS. WHILE MEEIA 2016 AND 2019 CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS REDUCED RETAIL SALES VOLUMES, THE RECOVERY OF LOST ELECTRIC MARGINS ENSURED THAT ELECTRIC MARGINS WERE NOT AFFECTED.  \u2022  NET ENERGY COSTS INCREASED MARGINS $1 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. THE CHANGE IN NET ENERGY COSTS IS THE SUM OF THE EFFECT OF REVENUE CHANGE IN OFF-SYSTEM SALES AND CAPACITY REVENUES (-  $32 MILLION  AND -  $51 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY), AND THE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE IN ENERGY COSTS (+  $32 MILLION  AND +  $52 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY) IN THE TABLE ABOVE.  AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S NATURAL GAS MARGINS WERE COMPARABLE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  AMEREN ILLINOIS  AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC MARGINS WERE COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  .

AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS\u2019 MARGINS INCREASED $23 MILLION  , OR  9%  , FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD.  AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION  AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION\u2019S MARGINS WERE COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018.  49  THE FOLLOWING ITEMS HAD A FAVORABLE EFFECT ON AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION\u2019S MARGINS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIODS (EXCEPT WHEN A SPECIFIED PERIOD IS REFERENCED).  \u2022  REVENUES INCREASED $3 MILLION  AND  $7 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAM INVESTMENTS PURSUANT TO THE FEJA.  \u2022  REVENUES INCREASED DUE TO THE RECOVERY OF HIGHER RECOVERABLE EXPENSES AND INCREASED RATE BASE UNDER FORMULA RATEMAKING PURSUANT TO THE IEIMA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER RECOGNIZED RETURN ON EQUITY, WHICH COLLECTIVELY INCREASED MARGINS  $4 MILLION  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION\u2019S MARGINS WERE UNFAVORABLY AFFECTED BY A REDUCTION IN POWER RESTORATION ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO OTHER UTILITIES AND THE ASSOCIATED RECOVERY OF LABOR AND BENEFIT COSTS FOR CREWS SUPPORTING THOSE EFFORTS, WHICH DECREASED REVENUES  $2 MILLION  AND  $9 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS  AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS\u2019 MARGINS WERE COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  .  AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS\u2019 MARGINS INCREASED $23 MILLION  , OR  9%  , FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD.  THE FOLLOWING ITEMS HAD A FAVORABLE EFFECT ON AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS\u2019 MARGINS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD.  \u2022  THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A CHANGE IN RATE DESIGN PURSUANT TO THE ICC\u2019S NOVEMBER 2018 NATURAL GAS ORDER INCREASED MARGINS BY  $9 MILLION  . THIS CHANGE IN RATE DESIGN CONCENTRATES MORE REVENUES IN THE WINTER HEATING SEASON DUE TO AN INCREASE IN VOLUMETRIC RATES AND A DECREASE IN FIXED CUSTOMER RATES. THE VBA ENSURES RECOVERABILITY OF THE NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICE REVENUE REQUIREMENT FOR RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL NONRESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS THAT IS DEPENDENT ON SALES VOLUMES. AS SUCH, THE CHANGE IS NOT EXPECTED TO MATERIALLY AFFECT YEAR-OVER-YEAR EARNINGS.  \u2022  REVENUES INCREASED  $8 MILLION  DUE TO HIGHER NATURAL GAS BASE RATES, AS A RESULT OF THE NOVEMBER 2018 NATURAL GAS RATE ORDER.  \u2022  REVENUES FROM QIP RECOVERIES, WHICH INCREASED MARGINS  $2 MILLION  , DUE TO ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN QUALIFIED NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE.  AMEREN ILLINOIS TRANSMISSION  AMEREN ILLINOIS TRANSMISSION\u2019S MARGINS INCREASED $4 MILLION  , OR  6%  , AND $12 MILLION  , OR  10%  , FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE  YEAR-AGO PERIODS  . MARGINS WERE FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY INCREASED CAPITAL INVESTMENT, AS EVIDENCED BY A 17% INCREASE IN RATE BASE USED TO CALCULATE THE REVENUE REQUIREMENT.  OTHER OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES  AMEREN  OTHER OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES WERE $11 MILLION  HIGHER IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , AND $3 MILLION  LOWER IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE  YEAR-AGO PERIODS  , DUE TO CHANGES DISCUSSED BELOW.

AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION  OTHER OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES WERE $3 MILLION  LOWER IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF  DECREASED BAD DEBT AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS.  OTHER OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES WERE $9 MILLION  LOWER IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD. LABOR AND BENEFIT COSTS DECREASED $8 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN POWER RESTORATION ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO OTHER UTILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, EXPENSES DECREASED BECAUSE OF A $4 MILLION INCREASE IN THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF COMPANY-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE AND A $3 MILLION REDUCTION IN BAD DEBT COSTS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $4 MILLION INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF REGULATORY ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FEJA ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAM.  AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS  OTHER OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES INCREASED $5 MILLION  AND $4 MILLION  IN THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH THE  YEAR-AGO PERIODS  , PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SYSTEM REPAIRS AND COMPLIANCE EXPENDITURES.  AMEREN ILLINOIS TRANSMISSION  OTHER OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES WERE COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  . OTHER OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES WERE $3 MILLION  LOWER IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED TRANSMISSION SYSTEM MAINTENANCE EXPENDITURES.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES INCREASED $11 MILLION  AND $7 MILLION  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , AND $25 MILLION  AND $18 MILLION  IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE  YEAR-AGO PERIODS  , AT AMEREN AND AMEREN ILLINOIS, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF ADDITIONAL PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT INVESTMENTS ACROSS THEIR RESPECTIVE SEGMENTS.

SEE NOTE 12 \u2013 INCOME TAXES UNDER PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT FOR A RECONCILIATION OF THE FEDERAL STATUTORY CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE TO THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE AMEREN COMPANIES. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  , AT AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS HIGHER AT AMEREN ILLINOIS TRANSMISSION AND AMEREN TRANSMISSION IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF DECREASED AMORTIZATION OF EXCESS DEFERRED TAXES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, ALONG WITH LOWER CURRENT YEAR TAX BENEFITS FROM CERTAIN DEPRECIATION DIFFERENCES ON PROPERTY-RELATED ITEMS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR EQUITY FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS LOWER AT AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF HIGHER NON-TAXABLE INCOME IN 2019. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  , AT EACH OF THE AMEREN ILLINOIS SEGMENTS AND AMEREN TRANSMISSION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  COLLECTIONS FROM OUR TARIFF-BASED REVENUES ARE OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. A DIVERSIFIED RETAIL CUSTOMER MIX, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF RATE-REGULATED RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL, AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS, PROVIDES US WITH A REASONABLY PREDICTABLE SOURCE OF CASH. IN ADDITION TO USING CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WE USE AVAILABLE CASH, BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS, COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES, AND/OR, IN THE CASE OF AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS, OTHER SHORT-TERM AFFILIATE BORROWINGS TO SUPPORT NORMAL OPERATIONS AND TEMPORARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. WE MAY REDUCE OUR SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS WITH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS OR, AT OUR DISCRETION, WITH LONG-TERM BORROWINGS OR, IN THE CASE OF AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS, WITH CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM AMEREN (PARENT). IN THE NEAR TERM, OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS WILL DECREASE DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN THE FEDERAL STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATE ENACTED UNDER THE TCJA. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS RESULTS FROM REDUCED CUSTOMER RATES, REFLECTING THE TAX RATE DECREASE, WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX PAYMENTS UNTIL ABOUT 2020 BECAUSE OF OUR USE OF NET OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. ADDITIONALLY, OPERATING CASH FLOWS WILL BE FURTHER REDUCED BY LOWER CUSTOMER RATES, RESULTING FROM THE RETURN OF EXCESS DEFERRED TAXES. OVER TIME, THE DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS WILL BE OFFSET AS TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOOK AND TAXABLE INCOME REVERSE, AND BY INCREASED CUSTOMER RATES DUE TO HIGHER RATE BASE AMOUNTS RESULTING FROM LOWER ACCUMULATED DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITIES. WE EXPECT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AS WE INVEST IN OUR ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OVERALL SYSTEM RELIABILITY, GRID MODERNIZATION, RENEWABLE ENERGY REQUIREMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS. AS PART OF ITS PLAN TO FUND THESE CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS, AMEREN IS USING NEWLY ISSUED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, RATHER THAN MARKET-PURCHASED SHARES, TO SATISFY REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE DRPLUS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO DO SO THROUGH AT LEAST 2023. AMEREN ALSO PLANS TO ISSUE INCREMENTAL COMMON EQUITY TO FUND A PORTION OF AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S WIND GENERATION INVESTMENTS. AMEREN, AMEREN MISSOURI, AND AMEREN ILLINOIS EXPECT THEIR RESPECTIVE EQUITY TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION LEVELS OVER THE PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 2023 TO REMAIN IN-LINE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE EQUITY TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION LEVELS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THE USE OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS AT THE AMEREN COMPANIES FREQUENTLY RESULTS IN A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT, DEFINED AS CURRENT LIABILITIES EXCEEDING CURRENT ASSETS, AS WAS THE CASE AT  JUNE 30, 2019  . THE WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND OUR DECISION TO FINANCE OUR BUSINESSES WITH LOWER-COST COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES. WITH THE CREDIT CAPACITY AVAILABLE UNDER THE CREDIT  52  AGREEMENTS, ALONG WITH CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, THE AMEREN COMPANIES HAD NET AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY OF  $1.1 BILLION  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  .

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO FUEL, PURCHASED POWER, AND NATURAL GAS PURCHASED FOR RESALE ARE RECOVERED FROM CUSTOMERS THROUGH RATE ADJUSTMENT MECHANISMS, WHICH MAY BE ADJUSTED WITHOUT A TRADITIONAL RATE PROCEEDING. SIMILAR REGULATORY MECHANISMS EXIST FOR CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES THAT CAN ALSO AFFECT THE TIMING OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE TIMING OF CASH PAYMENTS FOR COSTS RECOVERABLE UNDER OUR REGULATORY MECHANISMS DIFFERS FROM THE RECOVERY PERIOD OF THOSE COSTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE SEASONALITY OF OUR ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS BUSINESSES, PRIMARILY CAUSED BY CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEMAND DUE TO WEATHER, SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF OUR CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  AMEREN  AMEREN\u2019S CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $59 MILLION  IN  THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE  YEAR-AGO PERIOD  . THE FOLLOWING ITEMS CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE.  \u2022  A $44 MILLION INCREASE PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM DECREASED FUEL COSTS AND PRODUCTION VOLUMES AT AMEREN MISSOURI AND DECREASED PURCHASED POWER COSTS AND VOLUMES, AND NATURAL GAS COSTS, AT AMEREN ILLINOIS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED CUSTOMER COLLECTIONS, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN WEATHER-RELATED SALES VOLUMES.  \u2022  A $23 MILLION INCREASE RESULTING FROM A DECREASE IN COAL INVENTORY LEVELS AT AMEREN MISSOURI DUE TO DELIVERY DISRUPTIONS FROM FLOODING IN 2019.  \u2022  A NET $19 MILLION INCREASE IN COLLATERAL RECEIVED FROM COUNTERPARTIES, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN THE MARKET PRICES OF POWER AND NATURAL GAS, CHANGES IN CONTRACTED COMMODITY VOLUMES, AND INCREASES RESULTING FROM AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 RENEWABLE ENERGY CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO PURSUANT TO FEJA.

AMEREN ILLINOIS  AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $165 MILLION  IN  THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE  YEAR-AGO PERIOD  . THE FOLLOWING ITEMS CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE.  \u2022  A $105 MILLION INCREASE PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM DECREASED PURCHASED POWER COSTS AND VOLUMES, DECREASED NATURAL GAS COSTS, AND A NET INCREASE ATTRIBUTABLE TO REGULATORY RECOVERY MECHANISMS.  \u2022  A $27 MILLION DECREASE IN INCOME TAX PAYMENTS TO AMEREN (PARENT) PURSUANT TO THE TAX ALLOCATION AGREEMENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND LOWER TAXABLE INCOME IN 2019.  \u2022  A $7 MILLION DECREASE IN PAYMENTS TO CONTRACTORS FOR ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION MAINTENANCE COSTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED VEGETATION MANAGEMENT COSTS.  \u2022  A NET $6 MILLION INCREASE IN COLLATERAL RECEIVED FROM COUNTERPARTIES, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN THE MARKET PRICES OF POWER AND NATURAL GAS, CHANGES IN IN CONTRACTED COMMODITY VOLUMES, AND INCREASES RESULTING FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO PURSUANT TO FEJA.  THE INCREASE IN AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES BETWEEN PERIODS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $9 MILLION DECREASE IN NATURAL GAS HELD IN STORAGE CAUSED PRIMARILY BY INCREASED WITHDRAWALS AS A RESULT OF COLDER WINTER TEMPERATURES IN THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  AMEREN\u2019S CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $25 MILLION  IN  THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE  YEAR-AGO PERIOD  , PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF  INCREASED  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF  $13 MILLION  , AS WELL AS A  $9 MILLION  INCREASE  IN NUCLEAR FUEL EXPENDITURES DUE TO THE TIMING OF PURCHASES. IN ADDITION TO THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE CHANGES AT AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS DISCUSSED BELOW, AMEREN\u2019S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCREASED DUE TO A $18 MILLION INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT ATXI. ATXI\u2019S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCREASED AS A RESULT OF INCREASED EXPENDITURES ON THE MARK TWAIN TRANSMISSION PROJECT OFFSET BY DECREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ON THE SPOON RIVER AND ILLINOIS RIVERS PROJECTS.  AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DECREASED  $22 MILLION  BETWEEN PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET MONEY POOL ADVANCES OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. IN  THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019  , AMEREN MISSOURI HAD NO MONEY POOL ADVANCES COMPARED WITH ADVANCES OF  $66 MILLION  IN THE  YEAR-AGO PERIOD  . ADDITIONALLY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCREASED  $41 MILLION  , PRIMARILY DUE TO SUBSTATION UPGRADES AND ENERGY DELIVERY INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES. THE DECREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS ALSO PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A  $9 MILLION  INCREASE IN NUCLEAR FUEL EXPENDITURES DUE TO THE TIMING OF PURCHASES.  AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DECREASED  $41 MILLION  BETWEEN PERIODS PRIMARILY DUE TO  DECREASED  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF  $46 MILLION  RELATED TO ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SYSTEM RELIABILITY PROJECTS.

BOTH CREDIT AGREEMENTS ARE AVAILABLE TO AMEREN (PARENT) TO SUPPORT ISSUANCES UNDER AMEREN (PARENT)\u2019S COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, SUBJECT TO AVAILABLE CREDIT CAPACITY UNDER THE AGREEMENTS. THE MISSOURI CREDIT AGREEMENT IS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT ISSUANCES UNDER AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. THE ILLINOIS CREDIT AGREEMENT IS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT ISSUANCES UNDER AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. ISSUANCES UNDER THE AMEREN (PARENT), AMEREN MISSOURI, AND AMEREN ILLINOIS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS WERE AVAILABLE AT LOWER INTEREST RATES THAN THE INTEREST RATES OF BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS. COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES WERE THUS PREFERRED TO CREDIT FACILITY BORROWINGS AS A SOURCE OF THIRD-PARTY SHORT-TERM DEBT.  IN ADDITION, AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS MAY BORROW CASH FROM THE UTILITY MONEY POOL WHEN FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE. THE RATE OF INTEREST DEPENDS ON THE COMPOSITION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNDS IN THE UTILITY MONEY POOL. AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS WILL ACCESS FUNDS FROM THE UTILITY MONEY POOL, THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS, OR THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS DEPENDING ON WHICH OPTION HAS THE LOWEST INTEREST RATES.  THE ISSUANCE OF SHORT-TERM DEBT SECURITIES BY AMEREN\u2019S UTILITY SUBSIDIARIES IS SUBJECT TO FERC APPROVAL UNDER THE FEDERAL POWER ACT. IN 2018, THE FERC ISSUED ORDERS AUTHORIZING AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS TO EACH ISSUE UP TO $1 BILLION OF SHORT-TERM DEBT SECURITIES THROUGH MARCH 2020 AND SEPTEMBER 2020, RESPECTIVELY. IN JULY 2019, THE FERC ISSUED AN ORDER AUTHORIZING ATXI TO ISSUE UP TO $300 MILLION OF SHORT-TERM DEBT SECURITIES THROUGH JULY 2021.  THE AMEREN COMPANIES CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THE ADEQUACY AND APPROPRIATENESS OF THEIR LIQUIDITY ARRANGEMENTS FOR CHANGING BUSINESS CONDITIONS. WHEN BUSINESS CONDITIONS WARRANT, CHANGES MAY BE MADE TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS OR TO OTHER BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS.  55  LONG-TERM DEBT AND EQUITY  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS AMEREN\u2019S EQUITY ISSUANCES, AS WELL AS ISSUANCES (NET OF ANY ISSUANCE PREMIUMS OR DISCOUNTS), REDEMPTIONS, REPURCHASES, AND MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT FOR AMEREN MISSOURI, AMEREN ILLINOIS, AND ATXI FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  .

AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE AMEREN COMPANIES WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS AND COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THEIR CREDIT AGREEMENTS, INDENTURES, AND ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION, AS APPLICABLE, AND ATXI WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS AND COVENANTS CONTAINED IN ITS NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT.  WE CONSIDER ACCESS TO SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL MARKETS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS NOT SATISFIED BY CASH PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES. INABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL ON REASONABLE TERMS, PARTICULARLY DURING TIMES OF UNCERTAINTY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESSES. AFTER ASSESSING ITS CURRENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE, LIQUIDITY, AND CREDIT RATINGS (SEE CREDIT RATINGS BELOW), AMEREN, AMEREN MISSOURI, AND AMEREN ILLINOIS EACH BELIEVES THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS. HOWEVER, EVENTS BEYOND AMEREN\u2019S, AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S, AND AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 CONTROL MAY CREATE UNCERTAINTY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS OR MAKE ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS UNCERTAIN OR LIMITED. SUCH EVENTS COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF CAPITAL AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS.  DIVIDENDS  THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF DIVIDENDS PAYABLE ON AMEREN\u2019S COMMON STOCK ARE WITHIN THE SOLE DISCRETION OF AMEREN\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AMEREN\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS NOT SET SPECIFIC TARGETS OR PAYOUT PARAMETERS WHEN DECLARING COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, BUT IT CONSIDERS VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING AMEREN\u2019S OVERALL PAYOUT RATIO, PAYOUT RATIOS OF OUR PEERS, PROJECTED CASH FLOW AND POTENTIAL FUTURE CASH FLOW  56  REQUIREMENTS, HISTORICAL EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW, PROJECTED EARNINGS, IMPACTS OF REGULATORY ORDERS OR LEGISLATION, AND OTHER KEY BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS. AMEREN EXPECTS ITS DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIO TO BE BETWEEN 55% AND 70% OF ANNUAL EARNINGS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

IT SHOULD BE EVALUATED INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY OTHER RATING. RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO REVISION OR WITHDRAWAL AT ANY TIME BY THE RATING ORGANIZATION.  57  COLLATERAL POSTINGS  ANY WEAKENING OF OUR CREDIT RATINGS MAY REDUCE ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL POSTINGS AND PREPAYMENTS. SUCH CHANGES MAY ALSO INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING, RESULTING IN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON EARNINGS. CASH COLLATERAL POSTINGS AND PREPAYMENTS MADE WITH EXTERNAL PARTIES, INCLUDING POSTINGS RELATED TO EXCHANGE-TRADED CONTRACTS, AND CASH COLLATERAL POSTED BY EXTERNAL PARTIES WERE IMMATERIAL AT  JUNE 30, 2019  . A SUB-INVESTMENT-GRADE ISSUER OR SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATING (BELOW \u201cBAA3\u201d FROM MOODY\u2019S OR BELOW \u201cBBB-\u201d FROM S&P) AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , COULD HAVE RESULTED IN AMEREN, AMEREN MISSOURI, OR AMEREN ILLINOIS BEING REQUIRED TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR OTHER ASSURANCES FOR CERTAIN TRADE OBLIGATIONS AMOUNTING TO $91 MILLION, $63 MILLION, AND $28 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES COULD TRIGGER ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL POSTINGS AND PREPAYMENTS. BASED ON CREDIT RATINGS AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , IF MARKET PRICES WERE 15% HIGHER OR LOWER THAN  JUNE 30, 2019  LEVELS IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND 20% HIGHER OR LOWER THEREAFTER THROUGH THE END OF THE TERM OF THE COMMODITY CONTRACTS, THEN AMEREN, AMEREN MISSOURI, OR AMEREN ILLINOIS COULD BE REQUIRED TO POST AN IMMATERIAL AMOUNT, COMPARED TO EACH COMPANY\u2019S LIQUIDITY, OF COLLATERAL OR OTHER ASSURANCES FOR CERTAIN TRADE OBLIGATIONS.  OUTLOOK  WE SEEK TO EARN COMPETITIVE RETURNS ON INVESTMENTS IN OUR BUSINESSES. WE SEEK TO IMPROVE OUR REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS AND COST RECOVERY MECHANISMS AND ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY PURSUING CONSTRUCTIVE REGULATORY OUTCOMES WITHIN EXISTING FRAMEWORKS, WHILE ALSO ADVOCATING FOR RESPONSIBLE ENERGY POLICIES. WE ALIGN OUR OVERALL SPENDING, BOTH OPERATING AND CAPITAL, WITH ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND WITH THE FRAMEWORKS ESTABLISHED BY OUR REGULATORS TO CREATE AND CAPITALIZE ON INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS. WE FOCUS ON MINIMIZING THE GAP BETWEEN ALLOWED AND EARNED RETURNS ON EQUITY AND ON ALLOCATING CAPITAL RESOURCES TO BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE EXPECT WILL OFFER THE MOST ATTRACTIVE RISK-ADJUSTED RETURN POTENTIAL.  AS PART OF AMEREN\u2019S STRATEGIC PLAN, WE PURSUE PROJECTS TO MEET OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 ENERGY NEEDS AND TO IMPROVE ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS SYSTEM RELIABILITY, SAFETY, AND SECURITY WITHIN OUR SERVICE TERRITORIES. AMEREN ALSO EVALUATES COMPETITIVE ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY ARISE. ADDITIONALLY, AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS TO TRANSITION TO A CLEANER, MORE DIVERSE ENERGY GENERATION PORTFOLIO OVER TIME BY MAKING INVESTMENTS IN RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND RETIRING ITS COAL-FIRED GENERATION AT THE END OF EACH ENERGY CENTER\u2019S USEFUL LIFE, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  BELOW ARE SOME KEY TRENDS, EVENTS, AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY REASONABLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR LIQUIDITY, AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES, FOR 2019 AND BEYOND.  OPERATIONS  \u2022  IN 2018, MISSOURI SENATE BILL 564 WAS ENACTED AND AMEREN MISSOURI ELECTED PISA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAW.  PURSUANT TO ITS PISA ELECTION, AMEREN MISSOURI IS PERMITTED TO DEFER AND RECOVER 85% OF THE DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL RETURN ON RATE BASE ON CERTAIN PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT PLACED IN SERVICE AFTER SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, AND NOT INCLUDED IN BASE RATES. ACCUMULATED PISA DEFERRALS EARN CARRYING COSTS AT THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, WITH ALL APPROVED PISA DEFERRALS ADDED TO RATE BASE PROSPECTIVELY AND RECOVERED OVER A PERIOD OF 20 YEARS FOLLOWING A REGULATORY RATE REVIEW. ADDITIONALLY, UNDER THE RESRAM, AMEREN MISSOURI IS PERMITTED TO RECOVER THE 15% OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL RETURN FOR RENEWABLE GENERATION PLANT PLACED IN SERVICE AND NOT RECOVERED UNDER PISA. ACCUMULATED RESRAM DEFERRALS EARN CARRYING COSTS AT SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES. PISA AND THE RESRAM MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF REGULATORY LAG BETWEEN REGULATORY RATE REVIEWS. THOSE INVESTMENTS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR RECOVERY UNDER PISA AND THE REMAINING  15% OF CERTAIN PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT PLACED IN SERVICE, UNLESS ELIGIBLE FOR RECOVERY UNDER THE RESRAM, REMAIN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY LAG. AMEREN MISSOURI RECOGNIZES THE COST OF DEBT ON PISA DEFERRALS IN REVENUE, INSTEAD OF USING THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY, WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY BE RECOGNIZED IN REVENUES WHEN RECOVERY OF SUCH DEFERRALS ARE REFLECTED IN CUSTOMER RATES.  AS A RESULT OF THE PISA ELECTION, ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS OF THE LAW APPLY TO AMEREN MISSOURI, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON ELECTRIC CUSTOMER RATE INCREASES AND AN ELECTRIC BASE RATE FREEZE UNTIL APRIL 2020. BOTH THE RATE INCREASE LIMITATION AND PISA ARE EFFECTIVE THROUGH DECEMBER 2023, UNLESS AMEREN MISSOURI REQUESTS AND RECEIVES MOPSC APPROVAL OF AN EXTENSION THROUGH DECEMBER 2028.  IN JANUARY 2019, THE MOOPC FILED AN APPEAL WITH THE MISSOURI COURT OF APPEALS, WESTERN DISTRICT, CHALLENGING THE MOPSC\u2019S DECEMBER 2018 ORDER ALLOWING AMEREN MISSOURI TO RECOVER, THROUGH THE RESRAM, THE  15%  OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL RETURN NOT RECOVERED UNDER PISA. AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS A DECISION BY THE END OF 2019. THE RESRAM IS DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF REGULATORY LAG FOR THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARDS, INCLUDING RECOVERY OF INVESTMENTS IN WIND AND OTHER RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION, BY PROVIDING MORE TIMELY RECOVERY OF COSTS AND A RETURN ON INVESTMENTS NOT ALREADY PROVIDED FOR IN CUSTOMER RATES OR RECOVERED UNDER PISA.  \u2022  IN FEBRUARY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI ANNOUNCED ITS SMART ENERGY PLAN, WHICH INCLUDES A FIVE-YEAR CAPITAL INVESTMENT OVERVIEW WITH A DETAILED ONE-YEAR PLAN FOR 2019. THE PLAN IS DESIGNED TO UPGRADE AMEREN MISSOURI'S ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE AND INCLUDES INVESTMENTS THAT WILL UPGRADE THE GRID AND ACCOMMODATE MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY. INVESTMENTS UNDER THE PLAN ARE EXPECTED TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $6.3 BILLION OVER THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD FROM 2019 THROUGH 2023, WITH COSTS LARGELY RECOVERABLE UNDER PISA AND, FOR THE PORTION OF WIND AND OTHER RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT RECOVERABLE UNDER PISA, RECOVERABLE UNDER THE RESRAM. AS A PART OF ITS SMART  58  ENERGY PLAN, IN AUGUST 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS TO FILE FOR CERTIFICATES OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY WITH THE MOPSC TO BUILD THREE SOLAR FACILITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF MISSOURI. EACH 10 MEGAWATT SOLAR ENERGY GENERATION FACILITY WILL CONNECT TO BATTERY STORAGE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE SYSTEM RELIABILITY. ALL THREE FACILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2020.  \u2022  IN 2018, THE MOPSC ISSUED AN ORDER APPROVING AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S MEEIA 2019 PLAN. THE PLAN INCLUDES A PORTFOLIO OF CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS THROUGH DECEMBER 2021 AND LOW-INCOME CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS THROUGH DECEMBER 2024, ALONG WITH A REGULATORY RECOVERY MECHANISM. AMEREN MISSOURI INTENDS TO INVEST $226 MILLION OVER THE LIFE OF THE PLAN, INCLUDING $65 MILLION PER YEAR THROUGH 2021. THE PLAN INCLUDES THE CONTINUED USE OF THE MEEIA RIDER, WHICH ALLOWS AMEREN MISSOURI TO COLLECT FROM, OR REFUND TO, CUSTOMERS ANY DIFFERENCE IN ACTUAL MEEIA PROGRAM COSTS AND RELATED LOST ELECTRIC MARGINS AND THE AMOUNTS COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, THE PLAN INCLUDES A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE THAT PROVIDES AMEREN MISSOURI AN OPPORTUNITY TO EARN ADDITIONAL REVENUES BY ACHIEVING CERTAIN CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY GOALS, INCLUDING $7 MILLION, $10 MILLION, AND $13 MILLION IF 100% OF THE GOALS ARE ACHIEVED DURING 2019, 2020, AND 2021, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONAL REVENUES MAY BE EARNED IF AMEREN MISSOURI EXCEEDS 100% OF ITS ENERGY SAVINGS GOALS. BY THE END OF 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS AN ORDER FROM THE MOPSC APPROVING AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ENERGY SAVINGS RESULTS FOR THE THIRD PLAN YEAR OF THE MEEIA 2016 PROGRAMS.  \u2022  IN JUNE 2018, THE MOPSC APPROVED AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S RENEWABLE CHOICE PROGRAM, WHICH ALLOWS LARGE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS AND MUNICIPALITIES TO ELECT TO RECEIVE UP TO 100% OF THEIR ENERGY FROM RENEWABLE RESOURCES. THE TARIFF-BASED PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO RECOVER THE COSTS OF THE ELECTION, NET OF CHANGES IN THE MARKET PRICE OF SUCH ENERGY. BASED ON CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, THE PROGRAM ENABLES AMEREN MISSOURI TO SUPPLY UP TO 400 MEGAWATTS OF RENEWABLE WIND ENERGY GENERATION, UP TO 200 MEGAWATTS OF WHICH IT COULD OWN. AS APPLICABLE, THE ADDITION OF GENERATION BY AMEREN MISSOURI WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE ISSUANCE OF A CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY BY THE MOPSC, OBTAINING TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS WITH MISO OR OTHER RTOS, AND FERC APPROVAL. ANY OWNED GENERATION UNDER THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE INCREMENTAL TO ESTIMATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES THROUGH 2023 DISCUSSED BELOW. AMEREN MISSOURI ANTICIPATES FINALIZING CUSTOMER INTEREST AND PURSUING RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS TO FULFILL REQUIREMENTS IN 2019. WITHOUT EXTENSION, THE OPTION TO ELECT INTO THE PROGRAM WILL TERMINATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2023.  \u2022  IN JULY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI FILED A REQUEST WITH THE MOPSC SEEKING APPROVAL TO DECREASE ITS ANNUAL REVENUES FOR ELECTRIC SERVICE BY  $1 MILLION.  THE ELECTRIC RATE DECREASE REQUEST IS BASED ON A  9.95%  RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY, A CAPITAL STRUCTURE COMPOSED OF  51.9%  COMMON EQUITY, A RATE BASE OF  $8.0 BILLION  ,  AND A TEST YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WITH CERTAIN PRO-FORMA ADJUSTMENTS EXPECTED THROUGH AN ANTICIPATED TRUE-UP DATE OF DECEMBER 31, 2019. PRO-FORMA ADJUSTMENTS ARE ALSO EXPECTED FOR FUEL COSTS, TRANSPORTATION COSTS, MISO MULTI-VALUE TRANSMISSION PROJECT EXPENSES, AND PAYROLL COSTS EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2020.  THE MOPSC PROCEEDING RELATING TO THE PROPOSED ELECTRIC SERVICE RATE CHANGES WILL TAKE PLACE OVER A PERIOD OF UP TO  11  MONTHS, WITH A DECISION BY THE MOPSC EXPECTED BY LATE APRIL 2020 AND NEW RATES EFFECTIVE BY LATE MAY 2020.  A 50 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY WOULD RESULT IN AN ESTIMATED $20 MILLION CHANGE IN AMEREN\u2019S AND AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S NET INCOME, BASED ON AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S CURRENT ELECTRIC RATE BASE.  \u2022  IN JULY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI, THE MOPSC STAFF, AND CERTAIN INTERVENORS FILED A NONUNANIMOUS STIPULATION AND AGREEMENT WITH THE MOPSC TO DECREASE AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ANNUAL REVENUES FOR NATURAL GAS DELIVERY SERVICE BY  $1 MILLION.  THE REMAINING INTERVENORS TO THE REGULATORY RATE REVIEW DID NOT OBJECT TO THE AGREEMENT.  THE REQUESTED DECREASE IN ANNUAL RATES IS BASED ON A RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY RANGE OF  9.4%  TO  9.95%  AND A CAPITAL STRUCTURE COMPOSED  OF  52.0%  COMMON EQUITY, WHICH WAS AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S CAPITAL STRUCTURE AS OF MAY 31, 2019. THIS AGREEMENT ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF ISRS, WHICH WILL BE CALCULATED USING AN ROE OF  9.725%.  THE AGREEMENT REPRESENTS A  $1 MILLION  INCREASE TO AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ANNUAL REVENUES FOR NATURAL GAS DELIVERY SERVICE FROM INTERIM RATES, WHICH WERE APPROVED BY THE MOPSC IN DECEMBER 2018.  A DECISION BY THE MOPSC IS EXPECTED IN AUGUST 2019, WITH NEW RATES EXPECTED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN SEPTEMBER 2019.  \u2022  AMEREN CONTINUES TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN FERC-REGULATED ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION BUSINESSES. AMEREN ILLINOIS EXPECTS TO INVEST $2.2 BILLION IN ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION ASSETS FROM 2019 THROUGH 2023, TO REPLACE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND IMPROVE RELIABILITY. ATXI HAS THREE MISO-APPROVED MULTI-VALUE PROJECTS: THE SPOON RIVER, ILLINOIS RIVERS, AND MARK TWAIN PROJECTS. THE SPOON RIVER PROJECT, LOCATED IN NORTHWEST ILLINOIS, WAS PLACED IN SERVICE IN FEBRUARY 2018. THE ILLINOIS RIVERS PROJECT INVOLVES THE CONSTRUCTION OF A TRANSMISSION LINE FROM EASTERN MISSOURI ACROSS ILLINOIS TO WESTERN INDIANA.  CONSTRUCTION OF THE ILLINOIS RIVERS PROJECT IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE, WITH THE LAST SECTION EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 2020, PENDING THE OUTCOME OF CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  THE MARK TWAIN PROJECT INVOLVES THE CONSTRUCTION OF A TRANSMISSION LINE FROM NORTHEAST MISSOURI, CONNECTING THE ILLINOIS RIVERS PROJECT TO IOWA.  IN JUNE 2019, A SECTION OF THE MARK TWAIN PROJECT WAS COMPLETED FROM KIRKSVILLE, MISSOURI TO THE IOWA BORDER. CONSTRUCTION OF THE MARK TWAIN PROJECT BEGAN IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, WITH THE REMAINING SECTION EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2019. ATXI\u2019S EXPECTED INVESTMENT IN 2019 AND 2020 TO COMPLETE ITS MULTI-VALUE PROJECTS IS APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION, WITH THE TOTAL INVESTMENT EXPECTED TO BE MORE THAN $1.6 BILLION.  \u2022  AMEREN ILLINOIS AND ATXI USE A FORWARD-LOOKING RATE CALCULATION WITH AN ANNUAL REVENUE REQUIREMENT RECONCILIATION FOR EACH COMPANY\u2019S ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION BUSINESS. BASED ON EXPECTED RATE BASE GROWTH AND THE CURRENTLY ALLOWED 10.82% RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY, THE 2019 REVENUE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDED IN RATES FOR AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 AND ATXI\u2019S ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION BUSINESSES ARE $297 MILLION AND $177  59  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE REVENUE REQUIREMENTS REPRESENT AN INCREASE IN AMEREN ILLINOIS' AND ATXI\u2019S REVENUE REQUIREMENTS OF $24 MILLION AND $3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXPECTED RATE BASE GROWTH. THESE RATES WILL AFFECT AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 AND ATXI\u2019S CASH RECEIPTS DURING 2019, BUT WILL NOT DETERMINE THEIR RESPECTIVE ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SERVICE OPERATING REVENUES, WHICH WILL INSTEAD BE BASED ON 2019 ACTUAL RECOVERABLE COSTS, RATE BASE, AND RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY AS CALCULATED UNDER THE FERC FORMULA RATEMAKING FRAMEWORK.  \u2022  THE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY FOR MISO TRANSMISSION OWNERS, INCLUDING AMEREN ILLINOIS AND ATXI, IS THE SUBJECT OF A FERC COMPLAINT CASE FILED IN FEBRUARY 2015 CHALLENGING THE ALLOWED BASE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY. AMEREN ILLINOIS AND ATXI CURRENTLY USE THE FERC AUTHORIZED TOTAL ALLOWED RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY OF 10.82% IN CUSTOMER RATES. A FINAL FERC ORDER WOULD ESTABLISH THE ALLOWED RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY TO BE APPLIED TO THE 15-MONTH PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 2015 TO MAY 2016 AND ALSO ESTABLISH THE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY TO BE INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER RATES PROSPECTIVELY FROM THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SUCH ORDER, REPLACING THE CURRENT 10.82% TOTAL RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY.  IN OCTOBER 2018, THE FERC ISSUED AN ORDER IN AN UNRELATED CASE THAT PROPOSED A NEW METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE BASE RETURN ON EQUITY, WHICH REQUIRED FURTHER BRIEFS FROM THE PARTICIPANTS. IN NOVEMBER 2018, THE FERC ISSUED AN ORDER RELATED TO THE FEBRUARY 2015 COMPLAINT CASE AND THE SEPTEMBER 2016 ORDER, WHICH REQUIRED PARTICIPANTS TO FILE BRIEFS IN FEBRUARY 2019 REGARDING THE FERC\u2019S PROPOSED METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE BASE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY, INCLUDING WHETHER AND HOW TO APPLY THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY TO THE TWO MISO COMPLAINT CASES. IN MARCH 2019, THE FERC ISSUED SEPARATE NOTICES OF INQUIRY REGARDING ITS ALLOWED BASE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY POLICY AND ITS TRANSMISSION INCENTIVES POLICY. INITIAL COMMENTS WERE DUE IN JUNE 2019, AND REPLY COMMENTS ARE DUE BY LATE AUGUST 2019. THE NOTICE OF INQUIRY ADDRESSING THE FERC\u2019S RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY POLICY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BROADENS THE ABILITY TO COMMENT ON THE NEW METHODOLOGY BEYOND ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT ARE PARTICIPANTS IN THE COMPLAINT CASES, AND THE TRANSMISSION INCENTIVES NOTICE OF INQUIRY IS OPEN FOR INDUSTRY COMMENT ON THE FERC\u2019S TRANSMISSION INCENTIVE POLICY, INCLUDING INCENTIVE ADDERS TO THE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY. AMEREN IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY ON THESE COMPLAINT CASES OR THE NOTICES OF INQUIRY AT THIS TIME.  AS THE FERC IS UNDER NO DEADLINE TO ISSUE A FINAL ORDER, THE TIMING OF THE FINAL ORDER IN THE FEBRUARY 2015 COMPLAINT CASE AND ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT TO THE AMOUNTS REFUNDED AS A RESULT OF THE SEPTEMBER 2016 ORDER IS UNCERTAIN.  SEE NOTE 2 \u2013 RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, OF THIS REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING FERC COMPLAINT CASES. A 50 BASIS POINT REDUCTION IN THE FERC-ALLOWED BASE RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY WOULD REDUCE AMEREN\u2019S AND AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 NET INCOME BY AN ESTIMATED $9 MILLION AND $5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, BASED ON EACH COMPANY\u2019S 2019 PROJECTED RATE BASE.  \u2022  IN 2018, THE ICC ISSUED AN ORDER IN AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ANNUAL UPDATE FILING THAT APPROVED A $72 MILLION INCREASE IN AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE RATES BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2019. ILLINOIS LAW PROVIDES FOR AN ANNUAL RECONCILIATION OF THE ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION REVENUE REQUIREMENT AS IS NECESSARY TO REFLECT THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED AND INVESTMENT RETURN IN A GIVEN YEAR WITH THE REVENUE REQUIREMENT THAT WAS REFLECTED IN CUSTOMER RATES FOR THAT YEAR. CONSEQUENTLY, AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE REVENUES WILL BE BASED ON ITS 2019 ACTUAL RECOVERABLE COSTS, RATE BASE, AND RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY AS CALCULATED UNDER THE ILLINOIS PERFORMANCE-BASED FORMULA RATEMAKING FRAMEWORK. THE 2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE REVENUES ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER THAN THE 2018 REVENUES BECAUSE OF AN EXPECTED INCREASE IN RECOVERABLE COSTS AND EXPECTED RATE BASE GROWTH OF APPROXIMATELY 8%. THE 2019 REVENUE REQUIREMENT RECONCILIATION IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A REGULATORY ASSET THAT WILL BE COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS IN 2021. A 50 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN THE ANNUAL AVERAGE OF THE MONTHLY YIELDS OF THE 30-YEAR UNITED STATES TREASURY BONDS WOULD RESULT IN AN ESTIMATED $8 MILLION CHANGE IN AMEREN\u2019S AND AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 NET INCOME, BASED ON AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 2019 PROJECTED YEAR-END RATE BASE.  \u2022  IN APRIL 2019, AMEREN ILLINOIS FILED ITS ANNUAL ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE FORMULA RATE UPDATE TO ESTABLISH THE REVENUE REQUIREMENT TO BE USED FOR 2020 RATES WITH THE ICC. PENDING ICC APPROVAL, THIS UPDATE FILING WILL RESULT IN A  $7 MILLION  DECREASE IN AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE RATES, BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2020.  THESE RATES WILL AFFECT AMEREN ILLINOIS' CASH RECEIPTS DURING 2020, BUT WILL NOT AFFECT ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE REVENUES, WHICH WILL BE BASED ON ACTUAL RECOVERABLE COSTS, RATE BASE, AND RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY AS CALCULATED UNDER THE ILLINOIS PERFORMANCE-BASED FORMULA RATEMAKING FRAMEWORK.  \u2022  AMEREN ILLINOIS IS ALLOWED TO EARN A RETURN ON ITS ELECTRIC ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAM INVESTMENTS. AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 ELECTRIC ENERGY-EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS ARE DEFERRED AS A REGULATORY ASSET AND EARN A RETURN AT ITS WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, WITH THE EQUITY RETURN BASED ON THE ANNUAL AVERAGE OF THE MONTHLY YIELDS OF THE 30-YEAR UNITED STATES TREASURY BONDS PLUS 580 BASIS POINTS. THE EQUITY PORTION OF AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 RETURN ON ELECTRIC ENERGY-EFFICIENCY INVESTMENTS CAN BE INCREASED OR DECREASED BY UP TO 200 BASIS POINTS, DEPENDING ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ANNUAL ENERGY SAVINGS GOALS. PURSUANT TO THE FEJA, AMEREN ILLINOIS PLANS TO INVEST UP TO APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION PER YEAR IN ELECTRIC ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS THROUGH 2023 AND WILL EARN A RETURN ON THOSE INVESTMENTS. THE ICC HAS THE ABILITY TO REDUCE ELECTRIC ENERGY-EFFICIENCY SAVINGS GOALS IF THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT COST-EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE OR IF THE SAVINGS GOALS WOULD REQUIRE INVESTMENT LEVELS THAT EXCEED AMOUNTS ALLOWED BY LEGISLATION. THE ELECTRIC ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAM INVESTMENTS AND THE RETURN ON THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS THROUGH A RIDER AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION FORMULA RATEMAKING FRAMEWORK.  \u2022  AMEREN MISSOURI'S NEXT REFUELING AND MAINTENANCE OUTAGE AT ITS CALLAWAY ENERGY CENTER IS SCHEDULED FOR THE FALL OF 2020. DURING A SCHEDULED OUTAGE, WHICH OCCURS EVERY 18 MONTHS, MAINTENANCE EXPENSES INCREASE RELATIVE TO NON-OUTAGE YEARS. ADDITIONALLY, DEPENDING ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ITS OTHER GENERATION SOURCES AND THE MARKET PRICES FOR POWER, AMEREN MISSOURI'S PURCHASED POWER COSTS MAY  60  INCREASE AND THE AMOUNT OF EXCESS POWER AVAILABLE FOR SALE MAY DECREASE VERSUS NON-OUTAGE YEARS. CHANGES IN PURCHASED POWER COSTS AND EXCESS POWER AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE INCLUDED IN THE FAC, WHICH RESULTS IN LIMITED IMPACTS TO EARNINGS.  \u2022  AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS CONTINUE TO MAKE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND EXPECT TO SEEK REGULAR ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS RATE INCREASES TO RECOVER THE COST OF INVESTMENTS AND EARN AN ADEQUATE RETURN. AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS WILL ALSO SEEK LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS, AS NECESSARY, TO ADDRESS REGULATORY LAG AND TO SUPPORT INVESTMENT IN THEIR UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR CUSTOMERS. AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS CONTINUE TO FACE COST RECOVERY PRESSURES, INCLUDING LIMITED ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THEIR SERVICE TERRITORIES, CUSTOMER CONSERVATION EFFORTS, THE IMPACTS OF ADDITIONAL CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS, AND INCREASED CUSTOMER USE OF INCREASINGLY COST-EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, INCLUDING PRIVATE GENERATION AND ENERGY STORAGE. HOWEVER, OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE EXPECT THE DECREASED DEMAND TO BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED DEMAND RESULTING FROM INCREASED ELECTRIFICATION OF THE ECONOMY FOR EFFICIENCIES AND AS A MEANS TO ADDRESS CO  2  EMISSION CONCERNS. INCREASED INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING EXPECTED FUTURE INVESTMENTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, SYSTEM RELIABILITY IMPROVEMENTS, AND POTENTIAL NEW GENERATION SOURCES, RESULT IN RATE BASE AND REVENUE GROWTH BUT ALSO HIGHER DEPRECIATION AND FINANCING COSTS.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING RECENT RATE ORDERS, LAWSUITS, AND PENDING REQUESTS FILED WITH STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORY COMMISSIONS, SEE NOTE 2 \u2013 RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, OF THIS REPORT AND NOTE 2 \u2013 RATE AND REGULATORY MATTERS UNDER PART II, ITEM 8, OF THE FORM 10-K.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  \u2022  AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S 2017 IRP TARGETS CLEANER AND MORE DIVERSE SOURCES OF ENERGY GENERATION, INCLUDING SOLAR, WIND, NATURAL GAS, HYDRO, AND NUCLEAR POWER. IT ALSO INCLUDES EXPANDING RENEWABLE SOURCES BY ADDING AT LEAST 700 MEGAWATTS OF WIND GENERATION BY THE END OF 2020 IN MISSOURI AND NEIGHBORING STATES AND ADDING 100 MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR GENERATION BY 2027. THESE NEW RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES WOULD SUPPORT AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE OF MISSOURI\u2019S REQUIREMENT OF ACHIEVING 15% OF NATIVE LOAD SALES FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES BY 2021, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMER RATE INCREASE LIMITATIONS. BASED ON CURRENT AND PROJECTED MARKET PRICES FOR ENERGY AND FOR WIND AND SOLAR GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS ITS OWNERSHIP OF THESE RENEWABLE RESOURCES WOULD REPRESENT THE LOWEST-COST OPTION FOR CUSTOMERS. THE PLAN ALSO PROVIDES FOR THE EXPECTED IMPLEMENTATION OF CONTINUED CUSTOMER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS. AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S PLAN FOR THE ADDITION OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES COULD BE AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS: THE AVAILABILITY OF FEDERAL PRODUCTION AND INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS RELATED TO RENEWABLE ENERGY AND AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ABILITY TO USE SUCH CREDITS; THE COST OF WIND AND SOLAR GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES; ENERGY PRICES; AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ABILITY TO OBTAIN TIMELY INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENTS WITH MISO OR OTHER RTOS AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST; AND AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ABILITY TO OBTAIN A CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY FROM THE MOPSC, AND ANY OTHER REQUIRED PROJECT APPROVALS.  \u2022  IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2017 IRP FILING, AMEREN MISSOURI ESTABLISHED A GOAL OF REDUCING CO  2  EMISSIONS 80% BY 2050 FROM A 2005 BASE LEVEL. AMEREN MISSOURI IS ALSO TARGETING A 35% CO  2  EMISSION REDUCTION BY 2030 AND A 50% REDUCTION BY 2040 FROM THE 2005 LEVEL. IN ORDER TO MEET THESE GOALS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS TO RETIRE ITS COAL-FIRED GENERATION AT THE END OF EACH ENERGY CENTER\u2019S USEFUL LIFE.  \u2022  IN MAY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI ENTERED INTO A BUILD-TRANSFER AGREEMENT WITH A SUBSIDIARY OF ENEL GREEN POWER NORTH AMERICA, INC. TO ACQUIRE, AFTER CONSTRUCTION, AN UP-TO 300-MEGAWATT WIND GENERATION FACILITY TO BE LOCATED IN NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI. AMEREN MISSOURI FILED FOR A CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY WITH THE MOPSC IN MAY 2019.  IN JULY 2019, AMEREN MISSOURI, THE MOPSC STAFF, AND CERTAIN INTERVENORS FILED A NONUNANIMOUS STIPULATION AND AGREEMENT WITH THE MOPSC REGARDING THE REQUESTED CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY.  FINAL RTO INTERCONNECTION COSTS WERE DETERMINED IN JULY 2019, AND A RELATED RTO TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT IS EXPECTED BY THE FALL OF 2019.  \u2022  IN 2018, AMEREN MISSOURI ENTERED INTO A BUILD-TRANSFER AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE, AFTER CONSTRUCTION, AN UP-TO  400  -MEGAWATT WIND GENERATION FACILITY.  FINAL MISO INTERCONNECTION COSTS FOR THE FACILITY WERE DETERMINED IN JULY 2019, AND A RELATED TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT WITH THE MISO IS EXPECTED BY THE FALL OF 2019.  \u2022  BOTH FACILITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2020, WHICH WOULD SUPPORT AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S COMPLIANCE WITH THE MISSOURI RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARD.  BOTH ACQUISITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF A CERTIFICATE OF CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY BY THE MOPSC AND OBTAINING FERC APPROVAL FOR THE 300-MEGAWATT FACILITY, ENTERING INTO AN RTO TRANSMISSION INTERCONNECTION AGREEMENT AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST FOR EACH FACILITY, AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  THE TWO BUILD-TRANSFER AGREEMENTS COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY  $1.2 BILLION  OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EXPECTED IN 2020.  THE MOPSC HAS APPROVED A RESRAM, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF REGULATORY LAG FOR THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDARDS, INCLUDING RECOVERY OF INVESTMENTS IN WIND AND OTHER RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION, BY PROVIDING MORE TIMELY RECOVERY OF COSTS AND A RETURN ON INVESTMENTS NOT ALREADY PROVIDED FOR IN CUSTOMER RATES OR RECOVERED UNDER PISA.  \u2022  THROUGH 2023, WE EXPECT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO IMPROVE OUR ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE, WITH A MAJOR PORTION DIRECTED TO OUR TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL INVEST UP TO $13.9 BILLION (AMEREN  61  MISSOURI \u2013 UP TO $7.1 BILLION; AMEREN ILLINOIS \u2013 UP TO $6.6 BILLION; ATXI \u2013 UP TO $0.2 BILLION) OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE PERIOD FROM 2019 THROUGH 2023. AMEREN\u2019S AND AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S ESTIMATES INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION IN 2020 FOR CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN WIND GENERATION FACILITIES.  \u2022  ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO CO  2  EMISSIONS, OR OTHER ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE EPA, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING COSTS. CERTAIN OF THESE REGULATIONS ARE BEING CHALLENGED THROUGH LITIGATION, OR REVIEWED OR RECOMMENDED FOR REPEAL BY THE EPA, OR NEW REPLACEMENT OR ALTERNATIVE REGULATIONS ARE BEING CONTEMPLATED, PROPOSED, OR ADOPTED BY THE EPA AND STATE REGULATORS. THE ULTIMATE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY OF THESE REGULATIONS, AS WELL AS THE TIMING OF ANY SUCH IMPLEMENTATION, IS UNCERTAIN. HOWEVER, THE INDIVIDUAL OR COMBINED EFFECTS OF EXISTING AND NEW ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCREASED OPERATING COSTS, OR THE CLOSURE OR ALTERATION OF SOME OF AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S COAL-FIRED ENERGY CENTERS. AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE SUBJECT TO MOPSC PRUDENCE REVIEWS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN COST DISALLOWANCES AS WELL AS REGULATORY LAG. THE COST OF AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 PURCHASED POWER AND NATURAL GAS PURCHASED FOR RESALE COULD INCREASE. HOWEVER, AMEREN ILLINOIS EXPECTS THAT THESE COSTS WOULD BE RECOVERED FROM CUSTOMERS WITH NO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, OR LIQUIDITY. AMEREN\u2019S AND AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S EARNINGS COULD BENEFIT FROM INCREASED INVESTMENT TO COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS IF THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE REFLECTED AND RECOVERED ON A TIMELY BASIS IN CUSTOMER RATES.  \u2022  THE AMEREN COMPANIES HAVE MULTIYEAR CREDIT AGREEMENTS THAT CUMULATIVELY PROVIDE $2.1 BILLION OF CREDIT THROUGH DECEMBER 2022, SUBJECT TO A 364-DAY REPAYMENT TERM FOR AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS, WITH THE OPTION TO SEEK INCREMENTAL COMMITMENTS TO INCREASE THE CUMULATIVE CREDIT PROVIDED TO $2.5 BILLION. SEE NOTE 3 \u2013 SHORT-TERM DEBT AND LIQUIDITY UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS. AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS TO ISSUE LONG-TERM DEBT TO REPAY $244 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR SECURED NOTES SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN OCTOBER 2019. AMEREN ILLINOIS EXPECTS TO ISSUE LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. AMEREN, AMEREN MISSOURI, AND AMEREN ILLINOIS BELIEVE THAT THEIR LIQUIDITY IS ADEQUATE GIVEN THEIR EXPECTED OPERATING CASH FLOWS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND RELATED FINANCING PLANS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, DISRUPTIONS IN THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS, OR OTHER UNFORESEEN EVENTS WILL NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO EXECUTE THEIR EXPECTED OPERATING, CAPITAL, OR FINANCING PLANS.  \u2022  FEDERAL INCOME TAX LEGISLATION ENACTED UNDER THE TCJA WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY, AND FINANCIAL METRICS. THE TCJA, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REDUCED THE FEDERAL STATUTORY CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018. CUSTOMER RATES WERE REDUCED TO REFLECT THE LOWER INCOME TAX RATE, WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX PAYMENTS BECAUSE OF OUR USE OF NET OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS UNTIL ABOUT 2020. CUSTOMER RATES WERE ALSO REDUCED TO REFLECT THE RETURN OF EXCESS DEFERRED TAXES. THE RESULT OF THESE CUSTOMER RATE REDUCTIONS IS A DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN THE NEAR TERM. OVER TIME, THE DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS WILL BE OFFSET AS TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOOK AND TAXABLE INCOME REVERSE, AND BY INCREASED CUSTOMER RATES DUE TO HIGHER RATE BASE AMOUNTS RESULTING FROM LOWER ACCUMULATED DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITIES.  \u2022  IN 2018, OUR RATE-REGULATED BUSINESSES BEGAN TO AMORTIZE EXCESS DEFERRED TAXES. AMEREN ILLINOIS\u2019 AND ATXI'S INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, REFLECT A FULL YEAR OF AMORTIZATION, WHILE AMEREN MISSOURI'S INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, REFLECTS FIVE MONTHS OF AMORTIZATION RELATED TO ITS ELECTRIC BUSINESS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH A MOPSC ORDER RECEIVED IN JULY 2018. THE AMORTIZATION OF SUCH BALANCES RELATED TO AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S GAS BUSINESS STARTED IN JANUARY 2019, IN ACCORDANCE WITH A MOPSC ORDER RECEIVED IN DECEMBER 2018. THESE AMORTIZATIONS REDUCE OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATES. DUE TO FORMULA RATEMAKING, AMEREN ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION AND AMEREN TRANSMISSION HAVE AN OFFSETTING REDUCTION IN REVENUE FROM CUSTOMERS, WITH NO OVERALL IMPACT ON EARNINGS. AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS NATURAL GAS INTERIM PERIOD EARNINGS COMPARISONS BETWEEN 2019 AND 2018 MAY BE AFFECTED BY TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND REVENUE REDUCTIONS BASED ON THEIR REVENUE PATTERNS; HOWEVER, NO MATERIAL IMPACT TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR EARNINGS IS EXPECTED.  \u2022  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , AMEREN HAD $70 MILLION IN TAX BENEFITS FROM FEDERAL AND STATE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND $129 MILLION IN FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. THESE CARRYFORWARDS ARE EXPECTED TO LARGELY OFFSET INCOME TAX OBLIGATIONS IN 2019. THE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS ARE EXPECTED TO BE FULLY UTILIZED IN 2019. FUTURE EXPECTED INCOME TAX PAYMENTS AND REFUNDS ARE BASED ON PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ANY RELATED INCOME TAX CREDITS AND, IN THE CASE OF AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS, CONSISTENT WITH THE TAX ALLOCATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN AMEREN (PARENT) AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. AMEREN EXPECTS TO MAKE INCOME TAX PAYMENTS BETWEEN $10 MILLION AND $50 MILLION IN EACH YEAR FROM 2019 TO 2023, TOTALING $125 MILLION TO $175 MILLION FOR THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS TO MAKE INCOME TAX PAYMENTS TO AMEREN (PARENT) OF APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION IN 2019 AND BETWEEN $20 MILLION AND $30 MILLION IN 2020. ADDITIONALLY, AMEREN MISSOURI EXPECTS TO RECEIVE REFUNDS FROM AMEREN (PARENT) IN EACH YEAR FROM 2021 TO 2023, TOTALING $30 MILLION TO $60 MILLION FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD. AMEREN ILLINOIS EXPECTS TO MAKE INCOME TAX PAYMENTS TO AMEREN (PARENT) BETWEEN $20 MILLION AND $40 MILLION IN 2019 AND 2020 AND BETWEEN $50 MILLION AND $70 MILLION IN EACH YEAR FROM 2021 TO 2023, TOTALING $210 MILLION TO $260 MILLION FOR THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.  \u2022  AMEREN EXPECTS ITS CASH USED FOR CURRENTLY PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND DIVIDENDS TO EXCEED CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. TO FUND A PORTION OF THESE CASH REQUIREMENTS, BEGINNING IN 2018, AMEREN BEGAN USING NEWLY ISSUED SHARES  62  OF COMMON STOCK, RATHER THAN MARKET-PURCHASED SHARES, TO SATISFY REQUIREMENTS UNDER ITS DRPLUS AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO DO SO OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. AMEREN ALSO PLANS TO ISSUE INCREMENTAL COMMON EQUITY TO FUND A PORTION OF AMEREN MISSOURI\u2019S WIND GENERATION INVESTMENTS. AMEREN, AMEREN MISSOURI, AND AMEREN ILLINOIS EXPECT THEIR RESPECTIVE EQUITY TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION LEVELS OVER THE PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 2023 TO REMAIN IN-LINE WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE EQUITY TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION LEVELS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018. AMEREN MISSOURI AND AMEREN ILLINOIS EXPECT TO FUND CASH FLOW NEEDS THROUGH DEBT ISSUANCES, ADJUSTMENTS OF DIVIDENDS TO AMEREN (PARENT), AND/OR CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM AMEREN (PARENT).  THE ABOVE ITEMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND LIQUIDITY. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EVALUATE STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND LIQUIDITY. THESE STRATEGIES MAY INCLUDE ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE COSTS OR INCREASE REVENUES, AND OTHER STRATEGIC INITIATIVES TO INCREASE AMEREN\u2019S SHAREHOLDER VALUE. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHICH, IF ANY, OF THESE INITIATIVES WILL BE EXECUTED. THE EXECUTION OF THESE INITIATIVES MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, OR LIQUIDITY.

NET INCOME  DECREASED  BY  $19.0 MILLION  (10%) FROM NET INCOME OF  $186.8 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN LOSSES INCURRED, NET, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME AND A DECREASE IN OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. DILUTED INCOME PER SHARE DECLINED  6 PERCENT  REFLECTING THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME, OFFSET IN PART BY A DECREASE IN OUR DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING.  ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER  2019  WAS  $167.6 MILLION  (Q2 2018.  $189.2 MILLION  ) AND ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE WAS  $0.46  (Q2 2018.  $0.50  ). ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE DECLINED  8%  REFLECTING THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME, OFFSET IN PART BY A DECREASE IN OUR DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING.  LOSSES INCURRED, NET  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  WERE  $21.8 MILLION  , AN INCREASE OF  $35.3 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO A LOWER LEVEL OF FAVORABLE LOSS RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED DELINQUENCIES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS OFFSET IN PART BY LOWER CURRENT YEAR LOSSES INCURRED AS THE ESTIMATED CLAIM RATE ON NEW NOTICES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WAS 8%, COMPARED TO 9.5% IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE DECREASE IN OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN INCOME BEFORE TAX.  IN JUNE 2019, MGIC PAID A DIVIDEND OF $70 MILLION TO OUR HOLDING COMPANY AND WE EXPECT MGIC TO CONTINUE TO PAY QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS OF AT LEAST THAT AMOUNT, SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY MGIC\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND NON-DISAPPROVAL BY THE OCI.  COMPARATIVE YEAR TO DATE RESULTS  WE RECORDED NET INCOME OF  $319.7 MILLION  , OR  $0.87  PER DILUTED SHARE DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  2019  . NET INCOME  DECREASED  BY  $10.7 MILLION  FROM NET INCOME OF  $330.5 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN LOSSES INCURRED, NET, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PREMIUMS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. DILUTED INCOME PER SHARE WAS THE SAME AS THE PRIOR YEAR AS THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME WAS OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING.  ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  WAS  $320.0 MILLION  (YTD 2018.  $333.8 MILLION  ) AND ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE WAS  $0.87  (YTD 2018.  $0.88  ).  ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE WAS ROUGHLY THE SAME AS THE PRIOR YEAR AS THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME WAS OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING.  LOSSES INCURRED, NET FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  2019  WERE  $60.9 MILLION  , AN INCREASE OF  $50.5 MILLION  OVER THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO A LOWER LEVEL OF FAVORABLE LOSS RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED DELINQUENCIES AND THE RECOGNITION OF A PROBABLE LOSS OF $23.5 MILLION FOR LITIGATION OF OUR CLAIMS PAYING PRACTICES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THE INCREASE WAS OFFSET IN PART BY LOWER CURRENT YEAR LOSSES INCURRED AS THE ESTIMATED CLAIM RATE ON NEW NOTICES IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  2019  WAS 8%, COMPARED TO 9% IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE DECREASE IN OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN INCOME BEFORE TAX.  SEE  \u201cCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d  BELOW FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS.  MGIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION - Q2 2019 |  31  CAPITAL  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS  ON MARCH 19, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM UNDER WHICH WE MAY REPURCHASE UP TO $200 MILLION OF OUR COMMON STOCK THROUGH THE END OF 2020. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 1.8 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR $25 MILLION, WHICH USED THE REMAINING AUTHORIZATION ON THE PROGRAM ANNOUNCED IN APRIL 2018. REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME ON THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS MAY BE SUSPENDED FOR PERIODS OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 354 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING.  SINCE THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, THROUGH AUGUST 5, 2019, WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 1.8 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR APPROXIMATELY $23 MILLION.  DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS  ON JULY 25, 2019, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY OF $0.06 PER SHARE PAYABLE ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2019, TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON AUGUST 30, 2019.  GSES  WE MUST COMPLY WITH THE PMIERS TO BE ELIGIBLE TO INSURE LOANS DELIVERED TO OR PURCHASED BY THE GSES. IN ADDITION TO THEIR FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, THE PMIERS INCLUDE BUSINESS, QUALITY CONTROL AND CERTAIN TRANSACTION APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS. REFER TO  \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - CAPITAL ADEQUACY - PMIERS\u201d  OF THIS MD&A FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CAPITAL ADEQUACY UNDER PMIERS.  IF MGIC CEASES TO BE ELIGIBLE TO INSURE LOANS PURCHASED BY ONE OR BOTH OF THE GSES, IT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE VOLUME OF OUR NEW BUSINESS WRITINGS. FACTORS THAT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT MGIC\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THE FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE PMIERS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  E\u0300  THE GSES MAY AMEND THE PMIERS AT ANY TIME AND MAY MAKE THE PMIERS MORE ONEROUS IN THE FUTURE. THE GSES HAVE INDICATED THAT THERE MAY BE POTENTIAL FUTURE IMPLICATIONS FOR PMIERS BASED UPON FEEDBACK THE FHFA RECEIVES ON ITS JUNE 2018 PROPOSED RULE ON REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE GSES, WHICH INCLUDED A FRAMEWORK FOR DETERMINING THE CAPITAL RELIEF ALLOWED TO THE GSES FOR LOANS WITH PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE (PUBLIC COMMENTS WERE DUE BY NOVEMBER 16, 2018). FURTHER, ANY CHANGES TO THE GSES' CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS RESULTING FROM THE TREASURY HOUSING REFORM PLAN (DISCUSSED BELOW) COULD HAVE FUTURE IMPLICATIONS FOR PMIERS. IN ADDITION, THE PMIERS PROVIDE THAT THE FACTORS THAT DETERMINE MINIMUM REQUIRED ASSETS WILL BE UPDATED EVERY TWO YEARS AND MAY BE UPDATED MORE FREQUENTLY TO REFLECT CHANGES IN MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR LOAN PERFORMANCE. THE GSES HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY WILL GENERALLY PROVIDE NOTICE 180 DAYS PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SUCH UPDATES.  E\u0300  OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE MATTERS DISCUSSED IN OUR RISK FACTORS. SUCH MATTERS COULD DECREASE OUR REVENUES, INCREASE OUR LOSSES OR REQUIRE THE USE OF ASSETS, THEREBY CREATING A SHORTFALL IN AVAILABLE ASSETS.  E\u0300  SHOULD CAPITAL BE NEEDED BY MGIC IN THE FUTURE, CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR HOLDING COMPANY MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE DUE TO COMPETING DEMANDS ON HOLDING COMPANY RESOURCES, INCLUDING FOR REPAYMENT OF DEBT.  WHILE ON AN OVERALL BASIS, THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE ASSETS MGIC MUST HOLD IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO INSURE GSE LOANS IS GREATER UNDER THE PMIERS THAN WHAT STATE REGULATION CURRENTLY REQUIRES, OUR REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF THE PMIERS ON OUR RETURNS. HOWEVER, REINSURANCE MAY NOT ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE TO US OR AVAILABLE ON SIMILAR TERMS, IT SUBJECTS US TO COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK AND THE GSES MAY CHANGE THE CREDIT THEY ALLOW UNDER THE PMIERS FOR RISK CEDED UNDER OUR REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS.  STATE REGULATIONS  THE INSURANCE LAWS OF 16 JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING WISCONSIN, MGIC\u2019S DOMICILIARY STATE, REQUIRE A MORTGAGE INSURER TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF STATUTORY CAPITAL RELATIVE TO ITS NET RIF (OR A SIMILAR MEASURE) IN ORDER FOR THE MORTGAGE INSURER TO CONTINUE TO WRITE NEW BUSINESS. WE REFER TO THESE REQUIREMENTS AS THE \u201cSTATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.\u201d WHILE THEY VARY AMONG JURISDICTIONS, THE MOST COMMON STATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ALLOW FOR A MAXIMUM RISK-TO-CAPITAL RATIO OF 25 TO 1. A RISK-TO-CAPITAL RATIO WILL INCREASE IF (I) THE PERCENTAGE DECREASE IN CAPITAL EXCEEDS THE PERCENTAGE DECREASE IN INSURED RISK, OR (II) THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN CAPITAL IS LESS THAN THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN INSURED RISK. WISCONSIN DOES NOT REGULATE CAPITAL BY USING A RISK-TO-CAPITAL MEASURE BUT INSTEAD REQUIRES AN MPP.  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , MGIC\u2019S RISK-TO-CAPITAL RATIO WAS  10.1  TO 1, BELOW THE MAXIMUM ALLOWED BY THE JURISDICTIONS WITH STATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND ITS POLICYHOLDER POSITION WAS  $2.7 BILLION  ABOVE THE REQUIRED MPP OF  $1.6 BILLION  . IN CALCULATING OUR RISK-TO-CAPITAL RATIO AND MPP, WE HAVE TAKEN FULL CREDIT FOR THE RISK CEDED UNDER OUR QSR TRANSACTIONS AND HOME RE TRANSACTIONS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT UNDER THE REVISED STATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DISCUSSED BELOW, MGIC WILL NOT BE ALLOWED FULL CREDIT FOR THE RISK CEDED TO THE REINSURERS. IF MGIC IS NOT ALLOWED AN AGREED LEVEL OF CREDIT UNDER EITHER THE STATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OR THE PMIERS, MGIC MAY TERMINATE THE REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS, WITHOUT PENALTY. AT THIS TIME, WE EXPECT MGIC TO CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THE CURRENT STATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS; HOWEVER, REFER TO OUR RISK FACTOR TITLED \u201cSTATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MAY PREVENT US FROM CONTINUING TO WRITE NEW INSURANCE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED BASIS\u201d FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT MATTERS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT SUCH COMPLIANCE.  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE RISK-TO-CAPITAL RATIO OF OUR COMBINED INSURANCE OPERATIONS WAS  10  TO 1.  THE NAIC PLANS TO REVISE THE MINIMUM CAPITAL AND SURPLUS REQUIREMENTS FOR MORTGAGE INSURERS THAT ARE PROVIDED FOR IN ITS MORTGAGE GUARANTY INSURANCE MODEL ACT. IN MAY 2016, A WORKING GROUP OF STATE REGULATORS RELEASED AN EXPOSURE DRAFT OF A RISK-BASED CAPITAL FRAMEWORK TO ESTABLISH CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MORTGAGE INSURERS, ALTHOUGH NO DATE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BY WHICH THE NAIC MUST PROPOSE REVISIONS TO THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND CERTAIN ITEMS HAVE NOT YET BEEN COMPLETELY ADDRESSED BY THE FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING THE TREATMENT OF CEDED RISK, MINIMUM CAPITAL FLOORS, AND ACTION LEVEL TRIGGERS. CURRENTLY WE BELIEVE THAT THE PMIERS CONTAIN MORE RESTRICTIVE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAN THE DRAFT MORTGAGE GUARANTY INSURANCE MODEL ACT IN MOST CIRCUMSTANCES.  MGIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION - Q2 2019 |  32  GSE REFORM  THE FHFA HAS BEEN THE CONSERVATOR OF THE GSES SINCE 2008 AND HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CONTROL AND DIRECT THEIR OPERATIONS. THE INCREASED ROLE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ASSUMED IN THE RESIDENTIAL HOUSING FINANCE SYSTEM THROUGH THE GSE CONSERVATORSHIP MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE GSES CHANGE IN WAYS THAT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US AND THAT THE CHARTERS OF THE GSES ARE CHANGED BY NEW FEDERAL LEGISLATION. IN THE PAST, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE INTRODUCED SEVERAL BILLS INTENDED TO CHANGE THE BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE GSES AND THE FHA; HOWEVER, NO LEGISLATION HAS BEEN ENACTED.  IN MARCH 2019, PRESIDENT TRUMP DIRECTED THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP A PLAN, AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE, FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGISLATIVE REFORMS FOR THE HOUSING FINANCE SYSTEM (\u201cTREASURY HOUSING REFORM PLAN\u201d), WITH SUCH REFORMS TO REDUCE TAXPAYER RISK, EXPAND THE PRIVATE SECTOR\u2019S ROLE, MODERNIZE THE GOVERNMENT HOUSING PROGRAMS, AND ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP. THE DIRECTIVE OUTLINES NUMEROUS GOALS AND OBJECTIVES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE END OF CONSERVATORSHIP OF THE GSES, INCREASED COMPETITION AND PARTICIPATION OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN THE MORTGAGE MARKET INCLUDING BY AUTHORIZING THE FHFA TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL GUARANTORS OF CONVENTIONAL MORTGAGES IN THE SECONDARY MARKET, APPROPRIATE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE GSES, AND EVALUATION OF THE GSE PATCH. THE GSE PATCH EXPANDS THE DEFINITION OF QUALIFIED MORTGAGE (\u201cQM\u201d) UNDER THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT (REGULATION Z) TO INCLUDE MORTGAGES ELIGIBLE TO BE PURCHASED BY THE GSES, EVEN IF THE MORTGAGES DO NOT MEET THE DTI RATIO LIMIT OF 43% INCLUDED IN THE STANDARD QM DEFINITION.  THE GSE PATCH IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE NO LATER THAN JANUARY 2021. IN JULY 2019, THE CFPB RELEASED AN ADVANCED NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING ON THE QM DEFINITION. THE DIRECTOR OF THE CFPB INDICATED THAT THE CFPB WOULD CONSIDER ONLY A SHORT-TERM EXTENSION OF THE GSE PATCH. APPROXIMATELY 30% AND 24% OF OUR NIW IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS OF 2019, RESPECTIVELY, WAS ON LOANS WITH DTI RATIOS GREATER THAN 43%. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT NOT ALL FUTURE LOANS WITH DTI RATIOS GREATER THAN 43% WILL BE AFFECTED BY A SUNSET OF THE GSE PATCH, IN PART BECAUSE THE STANDARD QM DEFINITION MAY BE LIBERALIZED UNDER THE NEW RULES. IN THIS REGARD, WE NOTE THAT THE CFPB ASKED FOR COMMENT ABOUT WHETHER THE DEFINITION OF QM SHOULD RETAIN A DIRECT MEASURE OF A CONSUMER\u2019S PERSONAL FINANCES (FOR EXAMPLE, DTI RATIO); WHETHER THE DEFINITION SHOULD INCLUDE AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR ASSESSING FINANCIAL CAPACITY; WHETHER, IF THE QM DEFINITION RETAINS A DTI RATIO LIMIT, THE LIMIT SHOULD REMAIN 43% OR BE INCREASED OR DECREASED; AND WHETHER LOANS WITH DTI RATIOS ABOVE A PRESCRIBED LIMIT SHOULD BE GIVEN QM STATUS IF CERTAIN COMPENSATING FACTORS ARE PRESENT. WE MAY INSURE LOANS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AS QMS, HOWEVER, WE ARE UNSURE THE EXTENT TO WHICH LENDERS WILL MAKE NON-QM LOANS BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO THE PRESUMPTIONS ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE \u201cABILITY TO REPAY\u201d RULES THAT THE LAW ALLOWS WITH RESPECT TO QM LOANS. WE ARE ALSO UNSURE THE EXTENT TO WHICH LENDERS WILL PURCHASE PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE FOR LOANS THAT CANNOT BE SOLD TO THE GSES.  THE RULE THAT INCLUDES THE QM DEFINITION THAT APPLIES TO LOANS INSURED BY THE FHA WAS ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT (\u201cHUD\u201d) AND THAT DEFINITION IS LESS RESTRICTIVE THAN THE CFPB\u2019S DEFINITION IN CERTAIN RESPECTS, INCLUDING THAT (I) IT HAS NO DTI RATIO LIMIT, AND (II) IT ALLOWS THE LENDER CERTAIN PRESUMPTIONS ABOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE \u201cABILITY TO REPAY\u201d REQUIREMENTS ON HIGHER PRICED LOANS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT LENDERS WILL PREFER FHA-INSURED LOANS TO LOANS INSURED BY PRIVATE MORTGAGE INSURANCE AS A RESULT OF THE FHA\u2019S LESS RESTRICTIVE QM DEFINITION.  IN MARCH 2019, THE PRESIDENT ALSO DIRECTED THE SECRETARY OF HUD TO DEVELOP A PLAN THAT WOULD RECOMMEND ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGISLATIVE REFORMS TO THE PROGRAMS HUD OVERSEES, INCLUDING THOSE OF THE FHA AND THE GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE GSES, SEE OUR RISK FACTOR TITLED \u201cCHANGES IN THE BUSINESS PRACTICES OF THE GSES, FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT CHANGES THEIR CHARTERS OR A RESTRUCTURING OF THE GSES COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR INCREASE OUR LOSSES.\u201d  FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY.  PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND EARNED  PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND EARNED IN A YEAR ARE INFLUENCED BY.  \u2022  NIW, WHICH INCREASES IIF. MANY FACTORS AFFECT NIW, INCLUDING THE VOLUME OF LOW DOWN PAYMENT HOME MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS AND COMPETITION TO PROVIDE CREDIT ENHANCEMENT ON THOSE MORTGAGES FROM THE FHA, THE VA, OTHER MORTGAGE INSURERS, AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO MORTGAGE INSURANCE, INCLUDING GSE PROGRAMS THAT MAY REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE DEMAND FOR MORTGAGE INSURANCE. NIW DOES NOT INCLUDE LOANS PREVIOUSLY INSURED BY US THAT ARE MODIFIED, SUCH AS LOANS MODIFIED UNDER HARP.  \u2022  CANCELLATIONS, WHICH REDUCE IIF. CANCELLATIONS DUE TO REFINANCINGS ARE AFFECTED BY THE LEVEL OF CURRENT MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES COMPARED TO THE MORTGAGE COUPON RATES THROUGHOUT THE IN FORCE BOOK, CURRENT HOME VALUES COMPARED TO VALUES WHEN THE LOANS IN THE IN FORCE BOOK WERE INSURED AND THE TERMS ON WHICH MORTGAGE CREDIT IS AVAILABLE. HOME PRICE APPRECIATION CAN GIVE HOMEOWNERS THE RIGHT TO CANCEL MORTGAGE INSURANCE ON THEIR LOANS IF SUFFICIENT HOME EQUITY IS ACHIEVED. CANCELLATIONS ALSO RESULT FROM POLICY RESCISSIONS, WHICH REQUIRE US TO RETURN ANY PREMIUMS RECEIVED ON THE RESCINDED POLICIES AND CLAIM PAYMENTS, WHICH REQUIRE US TO RETURN ANY PREMIUM RECEIVED ON THE RELATED POLICIES FROM THE DATE OF DEFAULT ON THE INSURED LOANS. CANCELLATIONS OF SINGLE PREMIUM POLICIES, WHICH ARE GENERALLY NON-REFUNDABLE, RESULT IN IMMEDIATE RECOGNITION OF ANY REMAINING UNEARNED PREMIUM.  \u2022  PREMIUM RATES, WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY PRODUCT TYPE, COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INSURED LOANS, THE PERCENTAGE OF COVERAGE ON THE INSURED LOANS, AND PMIERS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR MONTHLY AND ANNUAL MORTGAGE INSURANCE PREMIUMS ARE UNDER PREMIUM PLANS FOR WHICH, FOR THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF THE POLICY, THE AMOUNT OF PREMIUM IS DETERMINED BY MULTIPLYING THE INITIAL PREMIUM RATE BY THE ORIGINAL LOAN  MGIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION - Q2 2019 |  33  BALANCE; THEREAFTER, THE PREMIUM RATE RESETS TO A LOWER RATE USED FOR THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE POLICY. HOWEVER, FOR LOANS THAT HAVE UTILIZED HARP, THE INITIAL TEN-YEAR PERIOD RESETS AS OF THE DATE OF THE HARP TRANSACTION. THE REMAINDER OF OUR MONTHLY AND ANNUAL PREMIUMS ARE UNDER PREMIUM PLANS FOR WHICH PREMIUMS ARE DETERMINED BY A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF THE LOAN\u2019S AMORTIZING BALANCE OVER THE LIFE OF THE POLICY.  \u2022  PREMIUMS CEDED, NET OF A PROFIT COMMISSION, UNDER OUR QSR TRANSACTIONS, AND PREMIUMS CEDED UNDER OUR HOME RE TRANSACTIONS. SEE  NOTE 4 - \u201cREINSURANCE\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS.  PREMIUMS ARE GENERATED BY THE INSURANCE THAT IS IN FORCE DURING ALL OR A PORTION OF THE PERIOD. A CHANGE IN THE AVERAGE IIF IN THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED TO AN EARLIER PERIOD IS A FACTOR THAT WILL INCREASE (WHEN THE AVERAGE IN FORCE IS HIGHER) OR REDUCE (WHEN IT IS LOWER) PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND EARNED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, ALTHOUGH THIS EFFECT MAY BE ENHANCED (OR MITIGATED) BY DIFFERENCES IN THE AVERAGE PREMIUM RATE BETWEEN THE TWO PERIODS AS WELL AS BY PREMIUMS THAT ARE RETURNED OR EXPECTED TO BE RETURNED IN CONNECTION WITH CLAIM PAYMENTS AND RESCISSIONS, AND PREMIUMS CEDED UNDER REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS. ALSO, NIW AND CANCELLATIONS DURING A PERIOD WILL GENERALLY HAVE A GREATER EFFECT ON PREMIUMS WRITTEN AND EARNED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS THAN IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THESE EVENTS OCCUR.  INVESTMENT INCOME  OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS COMPOSED PRINCIPALLY OF INVESTMENT GRADE FIXED INCOME SECURITIES. THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE INVESTMENT INCOME ARE THE SIZE OF THE PORTFOLIO AND ITS YIELD. AS MEASURED BY AMORTIZED COST (WHICH EXCLUDES CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, SUCH AS FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES), THE SIZE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS MAINLY A FUNCTION OF CASH GENERATED FROM (OR USED IN) OPERATIONS, SUCH AS NPW, INVESTMENT INCOME, NET CLAIM PAYMENTS AND EXPENSES, AND CASH PROVIDED BY (OR USED FOR) NON-OPERATING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS DEBT, STOCK ISSUANCES OR REPURCHASES, OR DIVIDENDS.  LOSSES INCURRED  LOSSES INCURRED ARE THE CURRENT EXPENSE THAT REFLECTS ESTIMATED PAYMENTS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE MADE AS A RESULT OF DELINQUENCIES ON INSURED LOANS. AS EXPLAINED UNDER \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d IN OUR  2018  10-K MD&A, EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A PREMIUM DEFICIENCY RESERVE, WE RECOGNIZE AN ESTIMATE OF THIS EXPENSE ONLY FOR DELINQUENT LOANS. THE LEVEL OF NEW DELINQUENCIES HAS HISTORICALLY FOLLOWED A SEASONAL PATTERN, WITH NEW DELINQUENCIES IN THE FIRST PART OF THE YEAR LOWER THAN NEW DELINQUENCIES IN THE LATTER PART OF THE YEAR, THOUGH THIS PATTERN CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY AND LOCAL HOUSING MARKETS. LOSSES INCURRED ARE GENERALLY AFFECTED BY.  \u2022  THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY, INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING VALUES, EACH OF WHICH AFFECTS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT LOANS WILL BECOME DELINQUENT AND WHETHER LOANS THAT ARE DELINQUENT CURE THEIR DELINQUENCY.  \u2022  THE PRODUCT MIX OF THE IN FORCE BOOK, WITH LOANS HAVING HIGHER RISK CHARACTERISTICS GENERALLY RESULTING IN HIGHER DELINQUENCIES AND CLAIMS.  \u2022  THE SIZE OF LOANS INSURED, WITH HIGHER AVERAGE LOAN AMOUNTS TENDING TO INCREASE LOSSES INCURRED.  \u2022  THE PERCENTAGE OF COVERAGE ON INSURED LOANS, WITH DEEPER AVERAGE COVERAGE TENDING TO INCREASE LOSSES INCURRED.  \u2022  THE RATE AT WHICH WE RESCIND POLICIES OR CURTAIL CLAIMS. OUR ESTIMATED LOSS RESERVES INCORPORATE OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE RESCISSIONS OF POLICIES AND CURTAILMENTS OF CLAIMS, AND REVERSALS OF RESCISSIONS AND CURTAILMENTS. WE COLLECTIVELY REFER TO RESCISSIONS AND DENIALS AS \u201cRESCISSIONS\u201d AND VARIATIONS OF THIS TERM. WE CALL REDUCTIONS TO CLAIMS \u201cCURTAILMENTS.\u201d  \u2022  THE DISTRIBUTION OF CLAIMS OVER THE LIFE OF A BOOK. HISTORICALLY, THE FIRST FEW YEARS AFTER LOANS ARE ORIGINATED ARE A PERIOD OF RELATIVELY LOW CLAIMS, WITH CLAIMS INCREASING SUBSTANTIALLY FOR SEVERAL YEARS SUBSEQUENT AND THEN DECLINING, ALTHOUGH PERSISTENCY, THE CONDITION OF THE ECONOMY, INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING PRICES, AND OTHER FACTORS CAN AFFECT THIS PATTERN. FOR EXAMPLE, A WEAK ECONOMY OR HOUSING VALUE DECLINES CAN LEAD TO CLAIMS FROM OLDER BOOKS INCREASING, CONTINUING AT STABLE LEVELS OR EXPERIENCING A LOWER RATE OF DECLINE. SEE FURTHER INFORMATION UNDER \u201cMORTGAGE INSURANCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW CYCLE\u201d BELOW.  \u2022  LOSSES CEDED UNDER REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS. SEE  NOTE 4 - \u201cREINSURANCE\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS.  UNDERWRITING AND OTHER EXPENSES  UNDERWRITING AND OTHER EXPENSES INCLUDES ITEMS SUCH AS EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, FEES FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, DEPRECIATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE, AND PREMIUM TAXES, AND ARE REPORTED NET OF CEDING COMMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS. EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION EXPENSES ARE VARIABLE DUE TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, CHANGES IN BENEFITS, AND HEADCOUNT (WHICH CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO VOLUME). SEE  NOTE 4 - \u201cREINSURANCE\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS DISCUSSED IN  NOTE 3 - \u201cDEBT\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND UNDER  \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d  BELOW.  OTHER  CERTAIN ACTIVITIES THAT WE DO NOT CONSIDER PART OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL OPERATING ACTIVITIES MAY ALSO IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ARE DESCRIBED IN THE FOLLOWING.  NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES)  FIXED INCOME SECURITIES.  REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ARE A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT RECEIVED ON THE SALE OF A FIXED INCOME SECURITY AND THE FIXED INCOME SECURITY\u2019S COST BASIS, AS WELL AS ANY \u201cOTHER THAN TEMPORARY\u201d IMPAIRMENTS (\u201cOTTI\u201d) RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. THE AMOUNT RECEIVED ON THE SALE OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES IS AFFECTED BY THE COUPON RATE OF THE SECURITY COMPARED TO THE YIELD OF COMPARABLE SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF SALE.  MGIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION - Q2 2019 |  34  EQUITY SECURITIES.  REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ARE A FUNCTION OF THE PERIODIC CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE, AS WELL AS ANY OTTI RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.  REFER TO  \u201cEXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF OUR USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d  BELOW  TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE ITEMS IMPACT OUR EVALUATION OF OUR CORE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  MORTGAGE INSURANCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW CYCLE  IN GENERAL, THE MAJORITY OF ANY UNDERWRITING PROFIT THAT A BOOK GENERATES OCCURS IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE BOOK, WITH THE LARGEST PORTION OF ANY UNDERWRITING PROFIT REALIZED IN THE FIRST YEAR FOLLOWING THE YEAR THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN. SUBSEQUENT YEARS OF A BOOK MAY RESULT IN EITHER UNDERWRITING PROFIT OR UNDERWRITING LOSSES. THIS PATTERN OF RESULTS TYPICALLY OCCURS BECAUSE RELATIVELY FEW OF THE INCURRED LOSSES ON DELINQUENCIES THAT A BOOK WILL ULTIMATELY EXPERIENCE TYPICALLY OCCUR IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF THE BOOK, WHEN PREMIUM REVENUE IS HIGHEST, WHILE SUBSEQUENT YEARS ARE AFFECTED BY DECLINING PREMIUM REVENUES, AS THE NUMBER OF INSURED LOANS DECREASES (PRIMARILY DUE TO LOAN PREPAYMENTS) AND INCREASING LOSSES. THE TYPICAL PATTERN IS ALSO A FUNCTION OF PREMIUM RATES GENERALLY RESETTING TO LOWER LEVELS AFTER TEN YEARS.  MGIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION - Q2 2019 |  35  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF OUR USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  WE BELIEVE THAT USE OF THE NON-GAAP MEASURES OF ADJUSTED PRE-TAX OPERATING INCOME (LOSS), ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) AND ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE FACILITATE THE EVALUATION OF THE COMPANY'S CORE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THEREBY PROVIDING RELEVANT INFORMATION TO INVESTORS. THESE MEASURES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS ALTERNATIVES TO GAAP MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE.  ADJUSTED PRE-TAX OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)  IS DEFINED AS GAAP INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE TAX, EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES), GAIN (LOSS) ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT, NET IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN INCOME (LOSS) AND INFREQUENT OR UNUSUAL NON-OPERATING ITEMS WHERE APPLICABLE.  ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)  IS DEFINED AS GAAP NET INCOME (LOSS) EXCLUDING THE AFTER-TAX EFFECTS OF NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES), GAIN (LOSS) ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT, NET IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN INCOME (LOSS), AND INFREQUENT OR UNUSUAL NON-OPERATING ITEMS WHERE APPLICABLE. THE AMOUNTS OF ADJUSTMENTS TO COMPONENTS OF PRE-TAX OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) ARE TAX EFFECTED USING A FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 21%.  ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE  IS CALCULATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARD REGARDING EARNINGS PER SHARE BY DIVIDING (I) ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) AFTER MAKING ADJUSTMENTS FOR INTEREST EXPENSE ON CONVERTIBLE DEBT, WHENEVER THE IMPACT IS DILUTIVE BY (II) DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING, WHICH REFLECTS SHARE DILUTION FROM UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND FROM CONVERTIBLE DEBT WHEN DILUTIVE UNDER THE \u201cIF-CONVERTED\u201d METHOD.  ALTHOUGH ADJUSTED PRE-TAX OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) AND ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) EXCLUDE CERTAIN ITEMS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST AND ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE FUTURE, THE EXCLUDED ITEMS REPRESENT ITEMS THAT ARE: (1) NOT VIEWED AS PART OF THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR PRIMARY ACTIVITIES; OR (2) IMPACTED BY BOTH DISCRETIONARY AND OTHER ECONOMIC OR REGULATORY FACTORS AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OPERATING TRENDS, OR BOTH. THESE ADJUSTMENTS, ALONG WITH THE REASONS FOR THEIR TREATMENT, ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. TRENDS IN THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL OPERATING ACTIVITIES CAN BE MORE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED WITHOUT THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS. OTHER COMPANIES MAY CALCULATE THESE MEASURES DIFFERENTLY. THEREFORE, THEIR MEASURES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED BY US.  (1)  NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).  THE RECOGNITION OF NET REALIZED INVESTMENT GAINS OR LOSSES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS PERIODS AS THE TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES SALES IS HIGHLY DISCRETIONARY AND IS INFLUENCED BY SUCH FACTORS AS MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, OUR TAX AND CAPITAL PROFILE, AND OVERALL MARKET CYCLES.  (2)  GAINS AND LOSSES ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT.  GAINS AND LOSSES ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT RESULT FROM DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES THAT ARE UNDERTAKEN TO ENHANCE OUR CAPITAL POSITION, IMPROVE OUR DEBT PROFILE, AND/OR REDUCE POTENTIAL DILUTION FROM OUR OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE DEBT.  (3)  NET IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.  THE RECOGNITION OF NET IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN BOTH SIZE AND TIMING, DEPENDING ON MARKET CREDIT CYCLES, INDIVIDUAL ISSUER PERFORMANCE, AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  (4)  INFREQUENT OR UNUSUAL NON-OPERATING ITEMS.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO OUR IRS DISPUTE IS RELATED TO PAST TRANSACTIONS WHICH ARE NON-RECURRING IN NATURE AND ARE NOT PART OF OUR PRIMARY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

MGIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION - Q2 2019 |  37  MORTGAGE INSURANCE PORTFOLIO  NEW INSURANCE WRITTEN  ACCORDING TO  INSIDE MORTGAGE FINANCE  AND GSE ESTIMATES  ,  TOTAL MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, ON AVERAGE, ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE INCREASED FROM THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS IS GENERALLY INFLUENCED BY THE LEVEL OF NEW AND EXISTING HOME SALES, THE PERCENTAGE OF HOMES PURCHASED FOR CASH, AND THE LEVEL OF REFINANCE ACTIVITY. PMI MARKET SHARE OF TOTAL MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS IS INFLUENCED BY THE MIX OF PURCHASE AND REFINANCE ORIGINATIONS AS PMI MARKET SHARE IS 3-4 TIMES HIGHER FOR PURCHASE ORIGINATIONS THAN REFINANCE ORIGINATIONS. PMI MARKET SHARE IS ALSO IMPACTED BY THE MARKET SHARE OF TOTAL ORIGINATIONS OF THE FHA, VA, USDA, AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO MORTGAGE INSURANCE, INCLUDING GSE PROGRAMS THAT MAY REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE DEMAND FOR MORTGAGE INSURANCE.  NIW FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  WAS  $14.9 BILLION  (  Q2  2018  .  $13.2 BILLION  ) AND FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 WAS  $25.0 BILLION  (YTD 2018.  $23.8 BILLION  ). THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR NIW ON LOANS WITH DTI RATIOS GREATER THAN 45% HAS DECLINED IN 2019, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS DUE IN PART TO CHANGES IN GSE UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES AND OUR PRICING FOR LOANS WITH SUCH DTI RATIOS. WE ARE CONTINUING TO MONITOR OUR EXPOSURE TO SUCH LOANS AND MAY TAKE FURTHER ACTION.

AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE, LOAN ORIGINATORS MAY HAVE CHANGED THE INFORMATION THEY PROVIDE TO US. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE CHANGED OUR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS, WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT THE DTI RATIO WE REPORT FOR EACH LOAN BEGINNING IN LATE 2018 INCLUDES THE RELATED MORTGAGE INSURANCE PREMIUMS IN THE CALCULATION.

OUR 2009 AND LATER BOOKS POSSESS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED RISK CHARACTERISTICS WHEN COMPARED TO OUR 2005-2008 ORIGINATION YEARS. THE CREDIT PROFILE OF OUR PRE-2009 RIF HAS BENEFITED FROM MODIFICATION AND REFINANCE PROGRAMS MAKING OUTSTANDING LOANS MORE AFFORDABLE TO BORROWERS WITH THE GOAL OF REDUCING THE NUMBER OF FORECLOSURES. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDED HAMP AND HARP, WHICH EXPIRED AT THE END OF 2016 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, BUT HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY OTHER GSE MODIFICATION PROGRAMS. HARP ALLOWED BORROWERS WHO WERE NOT DELINQUENT, BUT WHO MAY NOT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REFINANCE THEIR LOANS UNDER THE CURRENT GSE UNDERWRITING STANDARDS DUE TO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CURRENT LTV EXCEEDING 100%, TO REFINANCE AND LOWER THEIR NOTE RATE.

THE INCREASE IN CEDED PREMIUMS WAS DUE TO A NON-RECURRING TERMINATION FEE RELATED TO OUR 2015 QSR TRANSACTION, PREMIUMS CEDED UNDER OUR HOME RE TRANSACTIONS, AND A LOWER PROFIT COMMISSION DUE TO HIGHER CEDED LOSSES. NPE ALSO REFLECTS LOWER PREMIUM RATES ON OUR IIF AND AN INCREASE IN PREMIUMS FROM SINGLE PREMIUM POLICY CANCELLATIONS WHEN COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  COMPARATIVE YEAR TO DATE RESULTS  NPW DECREASED AND NPE INCREASED FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  WHEN COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. NPW AND NPE REFLECT AN INCREASE IN CEDED PREMIUMS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH OFFSET AN INCREASE IN PREMIUMS FROM HIGHER AVERAGE INSURANCE IN FORCE AND A DECREASE IN PREMIUM REFUNDS FROM LOWER CLAIM ACTIVITY. THE INCREASE IN CEDED PREMIUMS WAS DUE TO A NON-RECURRING TERMINATION FEE RELATED TO OUR 2015 QSR TRANSACTION, PREMIUMS CEDED UNDER OUR HOME RE TRANSACTIONS, AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF OUR IIF COVERED BY QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE. THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF HIGHER CEDED PREMIUMS AND IIF HAVING LOWER PREMIUM RATES ON OUR NPE WAS OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PREMIUMS FROM SINGLE PREMIUM POLICY CANCELLATIONS WHEN COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

WE EXPECT OUR PREMIUM YIELD TO DECLINE IN 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE PREMIUM RATES ON OUR IIF.  MGIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION - Q2 2019 |  41  REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS  QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE  OUR QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AFFECTS VARIOUS LINES OF OUR STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND THEREFORE WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE ANALYZED BY REVIEWING ITS TOTAL EFFECT ON OUR PRE-TAX INCOME, DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS.  E\u0300  WE CEDE A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUMS ON INSURANCE COVERED BY THE AGREEMENTS.  E\u0300  WE RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF A PROFIT COMMISSION THROUGH A REDUCTION IN THE PREMIUMS WE CEDE. THE PROFIT COMMISSION VARIES DIRECTLY AND INVERSELY WITH THE LEVEL OF LOSSES ON A \u201cDOLLAR FOR DOLLAR\u201d BASIS AND CAN BE ELIMINATED AT LOSS LEVELS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WE ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING. AS A RESULT, LOWER LEVELS OF LOSSES RESULT IN A HIGHER PROFIT COMMISSION AND LESS BENEFIT FROM CEDED LOSSES; HIGHER LEVELS OF LOSSES RESULT IN MORE BENEFIT FROM CEDED LOSSES AND A LOWER PROFIT COMMISSION (OR FOR LEVELS OF LOSSES WE DO NOT EXPECT, ITS ELIMINATION).  E\u0300  WE RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF A CEDING COMMISSION THROUGH A REDUCTION IN UNDERWRITING EXPENSES EQUAL TO 20% OF PREMIUMS CEDED (BEFORE THE EFFECT OF THE PROFIT COMMISSION).  E\u0300  WE CEDE A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF LOSSES INCURRED ON INSURANCE COVERED BY THE AGREEMENTS.  COVERED RISK  THE AMOUNT OF OUR NIW SUBJECT TO OUR QSR TRANSACTIONS AS SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE WILL VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD IN PART DUE TO COVERAGE LIMITS THAT MAY BE TRIGGERED DEPENDING ON THE MIX OF OUR RISK WRITTEN DURING THE PERIOD. THE 2019 QSR TRANSACTION COVERING OUR 2019 NIW INCREASED THRESHOLDS FOR RISK WRITTEN ON LOANS WITH LTV RATIOS OF 95% OR GREATER AND LOANS WITH DTI RATIOS GREATER THAN 45%, EACH WHEN COMPARED TO OUR 2018 QSR TRANSACTION. THE NIW SUBJECT TO QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE INCREASED FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO THE INCREASED THRESHOLD ON RISK WRITTEN ON LOANS WITH DTI RATIOS GREATER THAN 45% AND A DECREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR NIW WITH DTI RATIOS GREATER THAN 45%. IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018, THE RISK WRITTEN ON LOANS WITH DTI RATIOS GREATER THAN 45% EXCEEDED THE THRESHOLD.  WE TERMINATED A PORTION OF OUR 2015 QSR TRANSACTION EFFECTIVE JUNE 30, 2019 AND ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED QUOTA SHARE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WITH CERTAIN PARTICIPANTS FROM THE EXISTING REINSURANCE PANEL THAT EFFECTIVELY REDUCES THE QUOTA SHARE CEDE RATE FROM 30% TO 15% ON THE REMAINING ELIGIBLE INSURANCE. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE INCURRED A TERMINATION FEE OF $6.8 MILLION, WHICH WAS PAID IN JULY TO PARTICIPANTS OF THE REINSURANCE PANEL THAT ARE NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE AMENDED 2015 QSR TRANSACTION.

THE TERMS \u201cDELINQUENT\u201d AND \u201cDEFAULT\u201d ARE USED INTERCHANGEABLY BY US. WE CONSIDER A LOAN TO BE DELINQUENT WHEN IT IS TWO OR MORE PAYMENTS PAST DUE. LOSS RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED BASED ON ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF LOANS IN OUR DELINQUENT INVENTORY THAT WILL RESULT IN A CLAIM PAYMENT, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS THE CLAIM RATE, AND FURTHER ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM PAYMENT, WHICH IS REFERRED TO AS CLAIM SEVERITY.  ESTIMATION OF LOSSES IS INHERENTLY JUDGMENTAL. THE CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT THE CLAIM RATE AND CLAIM SEVERITY INCLUDE THE CURRENT AND FUTURE STATE OF THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY, INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT, AND THE CURRENT AND FUTURE STRENGTH OF LOCAL HOUSING MARKETS. THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF THE CLAIM PAYMENTS MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT THAN OUR LOSS RESERVE ESTIMATES. OUR ESTIMATES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING A DETERIORATION OF REGIONAL OR NATIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING UNEMPLOYMENT, LEADING TO A REDUCTION IN BORROWER INCOME AND THUS THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS, AND A DROP IN HOUSING VALUES THAT COULD RESULT IN, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GREATER LOSSES ON LOANS, AND MAY AFFECT BORROWER WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE MORTGAGE PAYMENTS WHEN THE VALUE OF THE HOME IS BELOW THE MORTGAGE BALANCE. HISTORICALLY, LOSSES INCURRED HAVE FOLLOWED A SEASONAL TREND IN WHICH THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR HAS WEAKER CREDIT PERFORMANCE THAN THE FIRST HALF, WITH HIGHER NEW NOTICE ACTIVITY AND A LOWER CURE RATE. OUR ESTIMATES ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY ANY AGREEMENTS WE ENTER INTO REGARDING OUR CLAIMS PAYING PRACTICES, SUCH AS THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS DISCUSSED IN  NOTE 5 \u2013 \u201cLITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. CHANGES TO OUR ESTIMATES COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPACT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION, EVEN IN A STABLE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.  COMPARATIVE QUARTERLY RESULTS  LOSSES INCURRED, NET IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  WERE  $21.8 MILLION  COMPARED TO  ($13.5) MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO A LOWER AMOUNT OF FAVORABLE LOSS RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED DELINQUENCIES. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF  2019  THERE WAS A $30 MILLION REDUCTION IN LOSSES INCURRED DUE TO POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT ON OUR PRIMARY LOSS RESERVES, BEFORE REINSURANCE, FOR PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED DELINQUENT NOTICES, COMPARED TO $70 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF  2018  .  CURRENT YEAR LOSSES INCURRED DECLINED DUE TO A LOWER ESTIMATED CLAIM RATE ON NEW NOTICES WHEN COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  COMPARATIVE YEAR TO DATE RESULTS  LOSSES INCURRED, NET IN THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  WERE  $60.9 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $10.4 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO LOWER FAVORABLE LOSS RESERVE DEVELOPMENT ON PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED DELINQUENCIES IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD, WHICH INCLUDES THE RECOGNITION OF A PROBABLE LOSS OF $23.5 MILLION FOR LITIGATION OF OUR CLAIMS PAYING PRACTICES. LOSSES INCURRED ON CURRENT YEAR DELINQUENCIES DECLINED PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOWER ESTIMATED CLAIM RATE ON NEW DELINQUENT NOTICES RECEIVED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

AS DISCUSSED IN  NOTE 11 - \u201cLOSS RESERVES,\u201d  THE AVERAGE TIME FOR SERVICERS TO PROCESS FORECLOSURES HAS RECENTLY SHORTENED. THEREFORE, WE EXPECT THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF MISSED PAYMENTS AT THE TIME A CLAIM IS RECEIVED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 18 TO 24 FOR NEW NOTICES RECEIVED, AND EXPECT TO RECEIVE IN 2019, COMPARED TO AN AVERAGE OF 37 MISSED PAYMENTS AT THE CLAIM RECEIVED DATE FOR CLAIMS PAID IN 2018. OUR LOSS RESERVES ESTIMATES TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION TRENDS OVER TIME, BECAUSE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DELINQUENCIES MAY VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD WITHOUT ESTABLISHING A MEANINGFUL TREND.  THE MAJORITY OF LOANS FROM 2005 THROUGH 2008 (WHICH REPRESENT  58%  OF THE LOANS IN THE DELINQUENT INVENTORY) ARE COVERED BY MASTER POLICY TERMS THAT, EXCEPT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, DO NOT LIMIT THE NUMBER OF YEARS THAT AN INSURED CAN INCLUDE INTEREST WHEN FILING A CLAIM. UNDER OUR CURRENT MASTER POLICY TERMS, AN INSURED CAN INCLUDE ACCUMULATED INTEREST WHEN FILING A CLAIM ONLY FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS THE LOAN IS DELINQUENT.

IN CONSIDERING THE POTENTIAL SENSITIVITY OF THE FACTORS UNDERLYING OUR ESTIMATE OF LOSS RESERVES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT EVEN A RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGE IN OUR ESTIMATED CLAIM RATE OR SEVERITY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON RESERVES AND, CORRESPONDINGLY, ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EVEN IN A STABLE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , ASSUMING ALL OTHER FACTORS REMAIN CONSTANT, A $1,000 INCREASE/DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE SEVERITY RESERVE FACTOR WOULD CHANGE THE RESERVE AMOUNT BY APPROXIMATELY +/- $11 MILLION. A 1 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE/DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE CLAIM RATE RESERVE FACTOR WOULD CHANGE THE RESERVE AMOUNT BY APPROXIMATELY +/- $17 MILLION.

HURRICANE ACTIVITY PRIMARILY IMPACTING TEXAS, FLORIDA, AND PUERTO RICO IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2017 INCREASED THE NUMBER OF NEW NOTICES OF DELINQUENCY REPORTED TO US IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017. CONSISTENT WITH OUR ANALYSIS AND PAST EXPERIENCE, THE MAJORITY OF THE DELINQUENT NOTICES IN THE HURRICANE AFFECTED AREAS THAT WE ESTIMATED TO BE CAUSED BY THE HURRICANES HAVE CURED AND DID NOT RESULT IN A MATERIAL INCREASE IN OUR INCURRED LOSSES OR LOSSES PAID. PAID LOSSES ON ALL LOANS IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS WERE IMPACTED IN PART BECAUSE FORECLOSURE MORATORIUMS IN THE TEXAS AND FLORIDA IADAS THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND PUERTO RICO THROUGH MAY 31, 2018, IMPACTED ALL DELINQUENT LOANS IN THOSE AREAS, INCLUDING THOSE NOT AFFECTED BY HURRICANES. FOR THOSE NOTICES WE ESTIMATED TO BE CAUSED BY THE HURRICANES, WE ESTABLISHED OUR LOSS RESERVES WITH A LOWER ESTIMATED CLAIM RATE THAN THE CLAIM RATE WE APPLIED TO OTHER NOTICES IN OUR DELINQUENT INVENTORY. WHEN EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THOSE NOTICES WE ESTIMATED TO BE CAUSED BY THE HURRICANES, THE AVERAGE TOTAL PRIMARY LOSS RESERVES PER DELINQUENCY WAS APPROXIMATELY $24,000 AT  JUNE 30, 2018.

NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  REFLECTS PURCHASES OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES IN AN AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDED OUR PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES DURING THE PERIOD AS CASH FROM OPERATIONS WAS AVAILABLE FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  REFLECTS PURCHASES OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES IN AN AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDED OUR PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES AND MATURITIES OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES DURING THE PERIOD AS CASH FROM OPERATIONS WAS AVAILABLE FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT, AS WELL AS, AMOUNTS SPENT ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  REFLECTS THE CASH SETTLEMENT OF SHARE REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS EXECUTED AT THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, SHARE REPURCHASES DURING THE PERIOD, AND PAYMENT OF WITHHOLDING TAXES RELATED TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION NET SHARE SETTLEMENT.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  REFLECTS SHARE REPURCHASES AND THE PAYMENT OF WITHHOLDING TAXES RELATED TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION NET SHARE SETTLEMENT.  CAPITALIZATION  DEBT - HOLDING COMPANY  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , OUR HOLDING COMPANY\u2019S DEBT OBLIGATIONS WERE $814.5 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL CONSISTING OF OUR  5.75% NOTES AND 9% DEBENTURES. MGIC\u2019S OWNERSHIP OF $132.7 MILLION OF OUR HOLDING COMPANY\u2019S 9% DEBENTURES IS ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION, BUT THEY REMAIN OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS OWED BY OUR HOLDING COMPANY TO MGIC.  LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS - HOLDING COMPANY  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  $333 MILLION  IN CASH AND INVESTMENTS AT OUR HOLDING COMPANY. THESE RESOURCES ARE MAINTAINED PRIMARILY TO SERVICE OUR DEBT INTEREST EXPENSE, PAY DEBT MATURITIES, REPURCHASE SHARES, PAY DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, AND TO SETTLE INTERCOMPANY OBLIGATIONS. WHILE THESE ASSETS ARE HELD, WE GENERATE INVESTMENT INCOME THAT SERVES TO OFFSET A PORTION OF OUR INTEREST EXPENSE. INVESTMENT INCOME AND THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS FROM OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF HOLDING COMPANY CASH INFLOW. MGIC IS THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF DIVIDENDS, AND THEIR PAYMENT IS RESTRICTED BY INSURANCE REGULATION. SEE  NOTE 14 - \u201cSTATUTORY INFORMATION\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT MGIC\u2019S DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS. THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS FROM MGIC IS ALSO INFLUENCED BY OUR VIEW OF THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF PMIERS AVAILABLE ASSETS TO MAINTAIN AN EXCESS OVER MINIMUM REQUIRED ASSETS. OTHER SOURCES OF HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY INCLUDE RAISING CAPITAL IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS. THE ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL IN THE PUBLIC MARKETS IS SUBJECT TO PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, INVESTOR DEMAND FOR THE SECURITIES TO BE ISSUED, AND OUR DEEMED CREDITWORTHINESS.  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WE USED $25 MILLION OF HOLDING COMPANY CASH TO REPURCHASE SHARES AND MAY USE ADDITIONAL HOLDING COMPANY CASH TO REPURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHARES OR TO REPURCHASE OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS. SUCH REPURCHASES MAY BE MATERIAL, MAY BE MADE FOR CASH (FUNDED BY DEBT) AND/OR EXCHANGES FOR OTHER SECURITIES, AND MAY BE MADE IN OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS. SEE  \u201cOVERVIEW - CAPITAL\u201d  OF THIS MD&A FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE ADDITIONAL SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED IN MARCH 2019.  IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  2019  , OUR HOLDING COMPANY CASH AND INVESTMENTS  INCREASED  BY $85 MILLION, TO  $333 MILLION  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019.  CASH  INFLOWS  DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS.  \u2022  $140 MILLION OF DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM MGIC,  \u2022  $8 MILLION OF INVESTMENT INCOME, AND  \u2022  $4 MILLION OF OTHER INFLOWS.  CASH  OUTFLOWS  DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS.  \u2022  $30 MILLION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS ON OUR 5.75% NOTES AND 9% DEBENTURES,  \u2022  $25 MILLION OF SHARE REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS,  \u2022  $12 MILLION FOR SHARE REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS IN 2018 THAT SETTLED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  WE EXPECT MGIC TO CONTINUE TO PAY QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS OF AT LEAST THE $70 MILLION AMOUNT PAID IN EACH OF THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS OF  2019  , SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY MGIC\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND NON-DISAPPROVAL BY THE OCI.  MGIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION - Q2 2019 |  51  THE NET UNREALIZED  GAINS  ON OUR HOLDING COMPANY INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WERE APPROXIMATELY  $2.3 MILLION  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND THE PORTFOLIO HAD A MODIFIED DURATION OF APPROXIMATELY  1.8  YEARS.  SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS, HOLDERS OF EACH OF THE 9% DEBENTURES MAY CONVERT THEIR NOTES INTO SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT THEIR OPTION PRIOR TO CERTAIN DATES UNDER THE TERMS OF THEIR ISSUANCE, IN WHICH CASE OUR CORRESPONDING OBLIGATION WILL BE ELIMINATED.  SEE NOTE 7 \u2013 \u201cDEBT\u201d TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONVERSION TERMS OF OUR 9% DEBENTURES AND THE TERMS OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING OUR OPTION TO DEFER INTEREST ON OUR 9% DEBENTURES. THE DESCRIPTION IN NOTE 7 - \u201cDEBT\u201d TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY THE TERMS OF THE NOTES AND DEBENTURES.  ALTHOUGH NOT ANTICIPATED IN THE NEAR TERM, WE MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE FUNDS TO OUR INSURANCE OPERATIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE PMIERS OR THE STATE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. SEE  \u201cOVERVIEW - CAPITAL\u201d  ABOVE FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE REQUIREMENTS. SEE DISCUSSION OF OUR NON-INSURANCE CONTRACT UNDERWRITING SERVICES IN  NOTE 5 \u2013 \u201cLITIGATION AND CONTINGENCIES\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR OTHER POSSIBLE USES OF HOLDING COMPANY RESOURCES.  DEBT AT SUBSIDIARIES  MGIC IS A MEMBER OF THE FHLB, WHICH PROVIDES MGIC ACCESS TO AN ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY VIA A SECURED LENDING FACILITY. MGIC HAS $155.0 MILLION OF DEBT OUTSTANDING IN THE FORM OF A FIXED RATE ADVANCE FROM THE FHLB. INTEREST ON THE ADVANCE IS PAYABLE MONTHLY AT AN ANNUAL RATE, FIXED FOR THE TERM OF THE ADVANCE, OF 1.91%. THE PRINCIPAL OF THE ADVANCE MATURES ON FEBRUARY 10, 2023. MGIC MAY PREPAY THE ADVANCE AT ANY TIME. SUCH PREPAYMENT WOULD BE BELOW PAR IF INTEREST RATES HAVE RISEN AFTER THE ADVANCE WAS ORIGINATED, OR ABOVE PAR IF INTEREST RATES HAVE DECLINED. THE ADVANCE IS SECURED BY ELIGIBLE COLLATERAL WHOSE FAIR VALUE IS MAINTAINED AT A MINIMUM OF 102% OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE. MGIC PROVIDED ELIGIBLE COLLATERAL FROM ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  CAPITAL ADEQUACY  PMIERS  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , MGIC\u2019S AVAILABLE ASSETS UNDER PMIERS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY  $4.4 BILLION  , AN EXCESS OF APPROXIMATELY  $1.1 BILLION  OVER ITS MINIMUM REQUIRED ASSETS; AND MGIC IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PMIERS AND ELIGIBLE TO INSURE LOANS DELIVERED TO OR PURCHASED BY THE GSES. MAINTAINING A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF AVAILABLE ASSETS WILL ALLOW MGIC TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PMIERS FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING, WE BELIEVE, TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE REVISED. OUR REINSURANCE TRANSACTIONS PROVIDED AN AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION OF PMIERS CAPITAL CREDIT AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  . REFER TO  NOTE 4 - \u201cREINSURANCE\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR QSR AND HOME RE TRANSACTIONS.  WE PLAN TO CONTINUOUSLY COMPLY WITH THE PMIERS THROUGH OUR OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES OR THROUGH THE CONTRIBUTION OF FUNDS FROM OUR HOLDING COMPANY, SUBJECT TO DEMANDS ON THE HOLDING COMPANY'S RESOURCES, AS OUTLINED ABOVE. REFER TO  \u201cOVERVIEW - CAPITAL - GSES\u201d  OF THIS MD&A FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF PMIERS.  RISK-TO-CAPITAL  WE COMPUTE OUR RISK-TO-CAPITAL RATIO ON A SEPARATE COMPANY STATUTORY BASIS, AS WELL AS ON A COMBINED INSURANCE OPERATION BASIS. THE RISK-TO-CAPITAL RATIO IS OUR NET RIF DIVIDED BY OUR POLICYHOLDERS\u2019 POSITION. OUR NET RIF INCLUDES BOTH PRIMARY AND POOL RISK IN FORCE, AND EXCLUDES RISK ON POLICIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN DEFAULT AND FOR WHICH LOSS RESERVES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED, AND THOSE COVERED BY REINSURANCE. THE RISK AMOUNT INCLUDES POOLS OF LOANS WITH CONTRACTUAL AGGREGATE LOSS LIMITS AND WITHOUT THESE LIMITS. POLICYHOLDERS\u2019 POSITION CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF STATUTORY POLICYHOLDERS\u2019 SURPLUS (WHICH INCREASES AS A RESULT OF STATUTORY NET INCOME AND DECREASES AS A RESULT OF STATUTORY NET LOSS AND DIVIDENDS PAID), PLUS THE STATUTORY CONTINGENCY RESERVE, AND A PORTION OF THE RESERVES FOR UNEARNED PREMIUMS. THE STATUTORY CONTINGENCY RESERVE IS REPORTED AS A LIABILITY ON THE STATUTORY BALANCE SHEET. A MORTGAGE INSURANCE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO MAKE ANNUAL ADDITIONS TO THE CONTINGENCY RESERVE OF APPROXIMATELY 50% OF NET EARNED PREMIUMS. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS MUST GENERALLY BE MAINTAINED FOR A PERIOD OF TEN YEARS.  HOWEVER, WITH REGULATORY APPROVAL A MORTGAGE INSURANCE COMPANY MAY MAKE EARLY WITHDRAWALS FROM THE CONTINGENCY RESERVE WHEN INCURRED LOSSES EXCEED 35% OF NET EARNED PREMIUMS IN A CALENDAR YEAR.

MGIC INVESTMENT CORPORATION - Q2 2019 |  52  THE INCREASES IN MGIC'S AND OUR COMBINED INSURANCE COMPANIES\u2019 RISK-TO-CAPITAL IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF 2019 WERE DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OUR RIF, NET OF REINSURANCE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN STATUTORY POLICYHOLDERS\u2019 POSITION DUE TO AN INCREASE IN STATUTORY CONTINGENCY RESERVES. OUR RIF, NET OF REINSURANCE, INCREASED IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF 2019, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OUR IIF AND A REDUCTION IN OUR CEDED RIF UNDER OUR 2015 QSR TRANSACTION. MGIC\u2019S RISK-TO-CAPITAL RATIO ALSO INCREASED DUE TO THE COMMUTATION OF AN AFFILIATE REINSURANCE AGREEMENT. OUR RISK-TO-CAPITAL RATIO WILL INCREASE IF THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN NET INSURED RISK EXCEEDS THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN CAPITAL.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE ITEMS RELATED TO OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS UPDATE AND CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  OUR OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES REPRESENT THE LOSS RESERVES ESTABLISHED TO RECOGNIZE THE LIABILITY FOR LOSSES AND LAE RELATED TO EXISTING DELINQUENCIES ON INSURED MORTGAGE LOANS. THE TIMING OF THE FUTURE CLAIM PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ESTABLISHED LOSS RESERVES WAS DETERMINED PRIMARILY BASED ON TWO KEY ASSUMPTIONS: THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES FOR A NOTICE OF DELINQUENCY TO DEVELOP INTO A RECEIVED CLAIM AND THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES FOR A RECEIVED CLAIM TO BE ULTIMATELY PAID. THE FUTURE CLAIM PAYMENT PERIODS ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND COULD EMERGE DIFFERENTLY THAN THIS ESTIMATE, IN PART, DUE TO UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN FACTORS, SUCH AS LOSS MITIGATION PROTOCOLS ESTABLISHED BY SERVICERS AND CHANGES IN SOME STATE FORECLOSURE LAWS THAT MAY INCLUDE, FOR EXAMPLE, A REQUIREMENT FOR ADDITIONAL REVIEW AND/OR MEDIATION PROCESS.  SEE  NOTE 11 \u2013 \u201cLOSS RESERVES\u201d  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP FOR THE MORTGAGE INSURANCE INDUSTRY, WE ESTABLISH LOSS RESERVES ONLY FOR DELINQUENT LOANS. BECAUSE OUR RESERVING METHOD DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE IMPACT OF FUTURE LOSSES THAT COULD OCCUR FROM LOANS THAT ARE NOT DELINQUENT, OUR OBLIGATION FOR ULTIMATE LOSSES THAT WE EXPECT TO OCCUR UNDER OUR POLICIES IN FORCE AT ANY PERIOD END IS NOT REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR IN THE TABLE ABOVE.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  OVERVIEW  METLIFE IS ONE OF THE WORLD\u2019S LEADING FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, PROVIDING INSURANCE, ANNUITIES, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND ASSET MANAGEMENT. METLIFE IS ORGANIZED INTO FIVE SEGMENTS: U.S.; ASIA; LATIN AMERICA; EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (\u201cEMEA\u201d); AND METLIFE HOLDINGS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY REPORTS CERTAIN OF ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN CORPORATE & OTHER. SEE NOTE  2  OF THE NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\u2019S SEGMENTS AND CORPORATE & OTHER. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY\u2019S SEGMENT PERFORMANCE AND ALLOCATED RESOURCES AND MAY ADJUST RELATED MEASUREMENTS IN THE FUTURE TO BETTER REFLECT SEGMENT PROFITABILITY.  CURRENT PERIOD HIGHLIGHTS  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, OVERALL SALES DECREASED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD PRIMARILY FROM LOWER SALES IN OUR RETIREMENT AND INCOME SOLUTIONS (\u201cRIS\u201d) BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF A LARGE PENSION RISK TRANSFER TRANSACTION IN THE PRIOR PERIOD. POSITIVE NET FLOWS DROVE AN INCREASE IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT YIELDS IMPROVED, HOWEVER, INTEREST CREDITED RATES WERE HIGHER FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR BUSINESSES. UNDERWRITING EXPERIENCE WAS MIXED, BUT OVERALL, WAS UNFAVORABLE COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD. A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES. A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN NET INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO PRIOR PERIOD LOSSES ON FAIR VALUE OPTION (\u201cFVO\u201d) BRIGHTHOUSE FINANCIAL, INC. COMMON STOCK (\u201cFVO BRIGHTHOUSE COMMON STOCK\u201d) DISPOSED OF IN JUNE 2018, AS WELL AS HIGHER GAINS ON SALES OF FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (\u201cAFS\u201d) IN THE CURRENT PERIOD VERSUS THE PRIOR PERIOD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER GAINS ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURES.  92  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS SEGMENT LEVEL RESULTS AND PERCENTAGE CONTRIBUTIONS TO TOTAL SEGMENT LEVEL ADJUSTED EARNINGS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  .  __________________  (1)  EXCLUDES CORPORATE & OTHER ADJUSTED LOSS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF  $307 MILLION.

THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED COMPANY OUTLOOK FROM THAT PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED IN THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT EXCEPT AS NOTED BELOW.  ASSUMING INTEREST RATES FOLLOW THE OBSERVABLE FORWARD YIELD CURVES AS OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE EXPECT THE AVERAGE RATIO OF FREE CASH FLOW TO ADJUSTED EARNINGS OVER THE TWO-YEAR PERIOD OF 2019 AND 2020 TO BE 65% TO 75%, ASSUMING A 10-YEAR U.S. TREASURY RATE BETWEEN 1.5% AND 4.5%. WE BELIEVE THAT FREE CASH FLOW IS A KEY DETERMINANT OF COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS AND COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES.  INDUSTRY TRENDS  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ON INDUSTRY TRENDS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2014 INDUSTRY TRENDS\u201d IN PART II, ITEM 7, OF THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT.  WE CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY THE CHANGING GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THAT HAS BEEN AFFECTING THE INDUSTRY.  94  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT  OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY GENERALLY. STRESSED CONDITIONS, VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTIONS IN GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS, PARTICULAR MARKETS, OR FINANCIAL ASSET CLASSES CAN HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US, IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVE A LARGE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND OUR INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGING MARKET FACTORS. SEE \u201cRISK FACTORS \u2014 ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CAPITAL MARKETS RISKS \u2014 DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\u201d INCLUDED IN THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT.  WE HAVE MARKET PRESENCE IN NUMEROUS COUNTRIES AND, THEREFORE, OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS POSED BY LOCAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, METLIFE IS THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF BENEFITS TO MEXICAN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, THE NEW ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT LO\u0301PEZ OBRADOR OF MEXICO IS IMPLEMENTING AN AUSTERITY PLAN WHICH, AMONG OTHER MEASURES, HAS ELIMINATED BENEFITS SUCH AS MAJOR MEDICAL INSURANCE AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO ADDITIONAL SAVINGS BENEFIT INSURANCE FOR SUCH INDIVIDUALS. SEE \u201cBUSINESS \u2014 REGULATION \u2014 FISCAL MEASURES\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS \u2014 ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CAPITAL MARKETS RISKS \u2014 DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION \u2014 CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK\u201d INCLUDED IN THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT.  WE ARE CLOSELY MONITORING POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT MIGHT CONTRIBUTE TO GLOBAL MARKET VOLATILITY AND IMPACT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, EVENTS FOLLOWING THE UNITED KINGDOM\u2019S (\u201cU.K.\u201d) REFERENDUM ON JUNE 23, 2016 AND THE UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS, ASSOCIATED WITH ITS PLANNED WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION (\u201cEU\u201d), HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO GLOBAL MARKET VOLATILITY. THESE FACTORS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO WEAKENING GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH, PRIMARILY IN THE U.K. AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE AND BEYOND. THE MAGNITUDE AND LONGEVITY OF THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE ECONOMIC IMPACTS WOULD DEPEND ON THE DETAILED AGREEMENTS REACHED BY THE U.K. AND THE EU AS A RESULT OF THE NEGOTIATIONS REGARDING FUTURE TRADE AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS. SEE \u201c\u2014 INVESTMENTS \u2014 CURRENT ENVIRONMENT \u2014 SELECTED COUNTRY AND SECTOR INVESTMENTS.\u201d WE ARE ALSO MONITORING THE IMPOSITION OF TARIFFS OR OTHER BARRIERS TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE, CHANGES TO INTERNATIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS, AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS OR A FAILURE TO RAISE THE DEBT CEILING, DUE TO A POLICY IMPASSE OR OTHERWISE, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND LIQUIDITY. SEE \u201cBUSINESS \u2014 REGULATION \u2014 CROSS-BORDER TRADE\u201d AND \u201cBUSINESS \u2014 REGULATION \u2014 FISCAL MEASURES\u201d INCLUDED IN THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT. SEE ALSO \u201cRISK FACTORS \u2014 ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CAPITAL MARKETS RISKS \u2014 DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS \u2014 BUSINESS RISKS \u2014 THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR OPERATIONS EXPOSES US TO A VARIETY OF POLITICAL, LEGAL, OPERATIONAL, ECONOMIC AND OTHER RISKS\u201d INCLUDED IN THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT.  CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD ARE USING MONETARY POLICY TO ADDRESS REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, WHICH HAD BEEN TIGHTENING POLICY BY RAISING THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AND SHRINKING THE BALANCE SHEET, NOW HAS LOWERED RATES TO SUSTAIN THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION. SIMILARLY, THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK ENDED QUANTITATIVE EASING IN DECEMBER 2018 AND LEFT INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED, BUT IS NOW CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL EASING, IF REQUIRED. IN JAPAN, THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT AND THE BANK OF JAPAN ARE MAINTAINING STIMULUS MEASURES IN ORDER TO BOOST INFLATION EXPECTATIONS AND ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN JAPAN. SUCH MEASURES INCLUDE THE IMPOSITION OF A NEGATIVE RATE ON COMMERCIAL BANK DEPOSITS, CONTINUED GOVERNMENT BOND PURCHASES AND TAX REFORM, INCLUDING THE LOWERING OF THE JAPANESE CORPORATE TAX RATE AND THE DELAY UNTIL OCTOBER 2019 OF AN INCREASE IN THE CONSUMPTION TAX TO 10%. GOING FORWARD, JAPAN\u2019S STRUCTURAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHALLENGES MAY CONTINUE TO LIMIT ITS POTENTIAL GROWTH UNLESS REFORMS THAT BOOST PRODUCTIVITY ARE PUT INTO PLACE. JAPAN\u2019S HIGH PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT LEVELS ARE MITIGATED BY LOW REFINANCING RISKS. FURTHER ACTIONS BY CENTRAL BANKS IN THE FUTURE MAY AFFECT INTEREST RATES AND RISK MARKETS IN THE U.S., EUROPE, JAPAN AND OTHER DEVELOPED AND EMERGING ECONOMIES, AND MAY ULTIMATELY RESULT IN MARKET VOLATILITY. WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE EFFECT OF THESE ACTIONS OR THE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OR DERIVATIVES. SEE \u201c\u2014 INVESTMENTS \u2014 CURRENT ENVIRONMENT.\u201d  IMPACT OF A SUSTAINED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT  DURING SUSTAINED PERIODS OF LOW INTEREST RATES, WE MAY HAVE TO INVEST INSURANCE CASH FLOWS AND REINVEST THE CASH FLOWS WE RECEIVED AS INTEREST OR RETURN OF PRINCIPAL ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN LOWER YIELDING INSTRUMENTS. MOREOVER, BORROWERS MAY PREPAY OR REDEEM THE FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, MORTGAGE LOANS AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WITH GREATER FREQUENCY IN ORDER TO BORROW AT LOWER MARKET RATES. THEREFORE, SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS EXPOSE US TO THE RISK THAT A REDUCTION IN INTEREST RATES WILL REDUCE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNTS THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO CREDIT ON CONTRACTS IN OUR GENERAL ACCOUNT AND THE RATE OF RETURN WE ARE ABLE TO EARN ON INVESTMENTS INTENDED TO SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE CONTRACTS. THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTEREST EARNED AND INTEREST CREDITED, OR MARGIN, IS A KEY METRIC FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF, AND REPORTING FOR, MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.  95  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR EXPECTATIONS REGARDING FUTURE MARGINS ARE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT IMPACTING THE AMORTIZATION OF CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS SUCH AS DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS (\u201cDAC\u201d) AND VALUE OF BUSINESS ACQUIRED (\u201cVOBA\u201d). SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER MARGINS MAY CAUSE US TO ACCELERATE THE AMORTIZATION, THEREBY REDUCING NET INCOME IN THE AFFECTED REPORTING PERIOD. ADDITIONALLY, LOWER MARGINS MAY ALSO IMPACT THE RECOVERABILITY OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS SUCH AS GOODWILL, REQUIRE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES OR TRIGGER LOSS RECOGNITION EVENTS ON CERTAIN POLICYHOLDER LIABILITIES. WE REVIEW THIS LONG-TERM MARGIN ASSUMPTION, ALONG WITH OTHER ASSUMPTIONS, AS PART OF OUR ANNUAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTION REVIEW.  SOME OF OUR SEPARATE ACCOUNT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING VARIABLE ANNUITIES, HAVE CERTAIN MINIMUM GUARANTEE BENEFITS. DECLINING INTEREST RATES INCREASE THE RESERVES WE NEED TO SET UP TO PROTECT THE GUARANTEE BENEFITS, THEREBY REDUCING NET INCOME IN THE AFFECTED REPORTING PERIOD.  IN FORMULATING ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS FOR OUR INSURANCE CONTRACT ASSUMPTIONS, WE USE PROJECTIONS THAT WE MAKE REGARDING INTEREST RATES. INCLUDED IN THESE ASSUMPTIONS IS THE PROJECTION THAT THE 10-YEAR TREASURY RATE WILL RISE TO 4.25% BY 2026. SEE \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2014 INDUSTRY TRENDS \u2014 IMPACT OF A SUSTAINED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT \u2014 LOW INTEREST RATE SCENARIO\u201d INCLUDED IN THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  COMPETITIVE PRESSURES  THE LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY REMAINS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. SEE \u201cBUSINESS \u2014 COMPETITION\u201d INCLUDED IN THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS FOCUSED ON DIFFERENTIATION LEADING TO MORE INTENSE COMPETITION WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCT FEATURES AND SERVICES. SEVERAL OF THE INDUSTRY\u2019S PRODUCTS CAN BE QUITE HOMOGENEOUS AND SUBJECT TO INTENSE PRICE COMPETITION. COST REDUCTION EFFORTS ARE A PRIORITY FOR INDUSTRY PLAYERS, WITH BENEFITS RESULTING IN PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO FAVOR CUSTOMERS AND REINVESTMENT CAPACITY. LARGER COMPANIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO INVEST IN BRAND EQUITY, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, TECHNOLOGY OPTIMIZATION, RISK MANAGEMENT, AND INNOVATION, WHICH ARE AMONG THE FUNDAMENTALS FOR SUSTAINED PROFITABLE GROWTH IN THE LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. INSURERS ARE FOCUSED ON THEIR CORE BUSINESSES, SPECIFICALLY IN MARKETS WHERE THEY CAN ACHIEVE SCALE. INSURERS ARE INCREASINGLY SEEKING ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF REVENUE; THERE IS A FOCUS ON MONETIZATION OF ASSETS, FEE-BASED SERVICES, AND OPPORTUNITIES TO OFFER COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS, WHICH INCLUDE PROVIDING VALUE-ADDED SERVICES ALONG WITH TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS. FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY AND TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION ARE PREREQUISITES FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH IN THE LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. LARGER MARKET PARTICIPANTS TEND TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO INVEST IN ANALYTICS, DISTRIBUTION, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO ENGAGE WITH THE NEW DIGITAL ENTRANTS. THERE IS A SHIFT IN DISTRIBUTION FROM PROPRIETARY TO THIRD PARTY MODELS IN MATURE MARKETS, DUE TO THE LOWER COST STRUCTURE. EVOLVING CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS ARE HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AS INSURERS STRIVE TO OFFER THE SUPERIOR CUSTOMER SERVICE DEMANDED BY AN INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED INDUSTRY CLIENT BASE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONTINUED VOLATILITY OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ITS IMPACT ON THE CAPITAL POSITION OF MANY COMPETITORS WILL CONTINUE TO STRAIN THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. LEGISLATIVE AND OTHER CHANGES AFFECTING THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT CAN ALSO AFFECT THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE LIFE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND WITHIN THE BROADER FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. SEE \u201c\u2014 INDUSTRY TRENDS \u2014 REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS,\u201d AS WELL AS \u201cBUSINESS \u2014 REGULATION\u201d INCLUDED IN THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT, AS AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTED IN OUR SUBSEQUENTLY FILED QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q UNDER THE CAPTION \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2014 INDUSTRY TRENDS \u2014 REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS.\u201d WE BELIEVE THAT THE AFOREMENTIONED FACTORS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED FINANCIAL STRENGTH, TECHNOLOGY EFFICIENCY, AND ORGANIZATIONAL AGILITY AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENTIATORS AND, AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED TO COMPETE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT.

PRINCIPLE-BASED RESERVING IS DESIGNED TO BETTER ADDRESS RESERVING FOR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE CURRENT GENERATION OF PRODUCTS FOR WHICH THE CURRENT FORMULAIC BASIS FOR RESERVE DETERMINATION DOES NOT WORK EFFECTIVELY. THE PRINCIPLE-BASED APPROACH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2017 IN THE STATES WHERE IT HAD BEEN ADOPTED, TO BE FOLLOWED BY A THREE-YEAR PHASE- IN PERIOD (AT THE OPTION OF INSURANCE COMPANIES ON A PRODUCT-BY-PRODUCT BASIS) FOR NEW BUSINESS SINCE IT WAS ENACTED INTO LAW BY THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF STATE LEGISLATURES. TO DATE, PRINCIPLE-BASED RESERVING HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY ALL OF THE STATES WHERE OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE DOMICILED. NEW YORK HAS ENACTED LEGISLATION THAT WILL REQUIRE PRINCIPLE-BASED RESERVING BY NO LATER THAN JANUARY 1, 2020. IN MAY 2019, THE NEW YORK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES (\u201cNYDFS\u201d) FORMALLY ADOPTED A REGULATION, WHICH WAS INITIALLY PROMULGATED AS AN EMERGENCY REGULATION IN DECEMBER 2018, UNDER WHICH THE NYDFS IS AUTHORIZED TO DEVIATE FROM THE RESERVE STANDARDS AND VALUATION METHODS SET FORTH IN THE NAIC VALUATION MANUAL (THE \u201cVALUATION MANUAL\u201d), IF THE NYDFS DETERMINES THAT AN ALTERNATIVE REQUIREMENT WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE POLICYHOLDERS OF NEW YORK. THE NYDFS IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING AN AMENDED VERSION OF THE REGULATION THAT WILL CONTAIN DEVIATIONS FROM THE VALUATION MANUAL FORMULAIC FLOOR THAT WILL BE A REQUIREMENT IN NEW YORK.  ERISA, FIDUCIARY CONSIDERATIONS, AND OTHER PENSION AND RETIREMENT REGULATION  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (\u201cDOL\u201d) ISSUED REGULATIONS THAT LARGELY WERE APPLICABLE IN 2017 THAT EXPANDED THE DEFINITION OF \u201cINVESTMENT ADVICE\u201d AND REQUIRED AN ADVISOR TO MEET AN IMPARTIAL OR \u201cBEST INTERESTS\u201d STANDARD (\u201cBICE\u201d), BUT THE REGULATIONS WERE FORMALLY VACATED BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT IN 2018. THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION ALSO VACATED CERTAIN DOL AMENDMENTS TO PROHIBITED TRANSACTION EXEMPTIONS. THE DOL HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT PLANS TO ISSUE REVISED FIDUCIARY INVESTMENT ADVICE REGULATIONS IN DECEMBER 2019. AT THIS TIME, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT FORM THOSE REGULATIONS MAY TAKE OR THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON US.  IN JUNE 2019, THE U.S SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) ADOPTED RULES AND INTERPRETATIONS ADDRESSING THE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT APPLICABLE TO BROKER-DEALERS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED PERSONS. THE CONDUCT STANDARDS APPLY WHEN PROVIDING BROKERAGE AND ADVISORY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO BENEFIT PLANS GOVERNED BY THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d) AND INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS (\u201cIRAS\u201d), AS WELL AS NON-BENEFIT PLAN RETAIL CLIENTS. UNDER THE SEC RULES, BROKER-DEALERS ARE NOT DEEMED TO BE FIDUCIARIES TO THEIR CLIENTS BY VIRTUE OF MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS BUT MUST ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR RETAIL CLIENTS WHEN MAKING A RECOMMENDATION. THE SEC\u2019S BEST INTEREST STANDARD IS NOT INTENDED TO TRACK THE DOL\u2019S FORMER BICE STANDARD. UNLIKE THE DOL RULE THAT WAS VACATED IN 2018, THERE IS NO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF THESE SEC RULES. THE DOL IS EXPECTED TO ADOPT A NEW RULE THAT WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE SEC\u2019S RULES, INCLUDING THE NEW BEST INTEREST STANDARD.  STATE REGULATORS AND LEGISLATURES IN NEVADA, NEW JERSEY, MARYLAND AND NEW YORK HAVE PROPOSED MEASURES THAT WOULD MAKE BROKER-DEALERS, SALES AGENTS, AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES SUBJECT TO A FIDUCIARY DUTY WHEN PROVIDING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING PENSION PLANS AND IRAS. THE SEC DID NOT INDICATE AN INTENT TO PRE-EMPT STATE REGULATION IN THIS AREA, AND SOME OF THE STATE PROPOSALS WOULD ALLOW FOR A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AS A RESULT OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT MAY BECOME MORE COSTLY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO PENSION PLANS AND IRAS OPERATING IN THE STATES SUBJECT TO THE NEW RULES.  IN OCTOBER 2018, CHILEAN PRESIDENT SEBASTIEN PIN\u0303ERA SUBMITTED TO CONGRESS A NEW PENSION REFORM BILL. IN JUNE 2019, THE GOVERNMENT AGREED WITH THE OPPOSITION PARTY TO INTRODUCE AN AMENDMENT TO THE BILL WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A SINGLE STATE-RUN ENTITY TO MANAGE NEW 4% MANDATORY EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WHILE THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WOULD NOT IMPACT THE 10% MANDATORY EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS MANAGED BY OUR PENSION ADMINISTRATION BUSINESS IN CHILE, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE TERMS OF THE FINAL BILL AND CANNOT CURRENTLY IDENTIFY ALL OF THE RISKS OR OPPORTUNITIES, IF ANY, THAT MAY BE POSED TO OUR BUSINESS IN CHILE. WHILE PRESIDENT PIN\u0303ERA\u2019S ADMINISTRATION HAS EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCELERATING DEBATE ON THE PENSION REFORM BILL, WE EXPECT THAT THE CONGRESSIONAL DEBATE MAY LAST THROUGH MOST OF 2019.  97  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DERIVATIVES REGULATION  IN JUNE 2019, THE SEC ADOPTED A SET OF RULES THAT ESTABLISH CAPITAL AND MARGIN REQUIREMENTS FOR SECURITY-BASED SWAPS. THE RULES ARE PART OF THE LARGER REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT THE SEC IS ESTABLISHING OVER SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS THAT IMPOSES REGISTRATION, DISQUALIFICATION, RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, AND CROSS-BORDER REGULATION. THE RULES WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE 18 MONTHS AFTER THE ADOPTION BY THE SEC OF RULES ON RECORDKEEPING AND CROSS-BORDER REGULATION OF SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PROPOSED AND ARE PENDING. WE ARE MONITORING THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT THESE RULES MIGHT HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS.  SECURITIES, BROKER-DEALER AND INVESTMENT ADVISER REGULATION  IN JUNE 2019, THE SEC ADOPTED RULES AND INTERPRETATIONS ADDRESSING THE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT APPLICABLE TO BROKER-DEALERS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED PERSONS, INCLUDING REGULATION BEST INTEREST, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON OFFERINGS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT OF THE NEW RULES, BEGINNING JUNE 30, 2020, BROKER-DEALERS RECOMMENDING OUR VARIABLE PRODUCTS TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH A \u201cBEST INTEREST\u201d STANDARD, WHICH THE SEC DID NOT DEFINE BUT DID CONFIRM WOULD BE HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT SUITABILITY STANDARD BUT NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF BEING A FIDUCIARY, AND PROVIDE DISCLOSURES ABOUT THEIR STANDARD OF CONDUCT AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, INCLUDING ON NEW FORM CRS. INVESTMENT ADVISERS TO RETAIL CLIENTS WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO FILE NEW FORM CRS WITH THE SEC AND DELIVER COPIES OF THE FORM TO THEIR RETAIL CLIENTS. AS NOTED ABOVE, THE SEC RULES DO NOT INCLUDE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. WE ARE MONITORING THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND CANNOT AT THIS TIME PREDICT THE EFFECT THEY MIGHT HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS.  SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO ADOPT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT AMOUNTS REPORTED ON THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE MOST CRITICAL ESTIMATES INCLUDE THOSE USED IN DETERMINING.  (I)  LIABILITIES FOR FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS AND THE ACCOUNTING FOR REINSURANCE;  (II)  CAPITALIZATION AND AMORTIZATION OF DAC AND THE ESTABLISHMENT AND AMORTIZATION OF VOBA;  (III)  ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF INVESTMENTS IN THE ABSENCE OF QUOTED MARKET VALUES;  (IV)  INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS;  (V)  ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES AND THE RECOGNITION AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES REQUIRING BIFURCATION;  (VI)  MEASUREMENT OF GOODWILL AND RELATED IMPAIRMENT;  (VII)  MEASUREMENT OF EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN LIABILITIES;  (VIII)  MEASUREMENT OF INCOME TAXES AND THE VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS; AND  (IX)  LIABILITIES FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS.  IN ADDITION, THE APPLICATION OF ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING REQUIRES THE USE OF ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES IN DETERMINING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED \u2014 THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH RELATE TO THE AFOREMENTIONED CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES. IN APPLYING THESE POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, MANAGEMENT MAKES SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS THAT FREQUENTLY REQUIRE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. MANY OF THESE POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND RELATED JUDGMENTS ARE COMMON IN THE INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRIES; OTHERS ARE SPECIFIC TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  THE ABOVE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE DESCRIBED IN \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2014 SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\u201d AND NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT.  ECONOMIC CAPITAL  ECONOMIC CAPITAL IS AN INTERNALLY DEVELOPED RISK CAPITAL MODEL, THE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS TO MEASURE THE RISK IN THE BUSINESS AND TO PROVIDE A BASIS UPON WHICH CAPITAL IS DEPLOYED. THE ECONOMIC CAPITAL MODEL ACCOUNTS FOR THE UNIQUE AND SPECIFIC NATURE OF THE RISKS INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESS.  98  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR ECONOMIC CAPITAL MODEL, COUPLED WITH CONSIDERATIONS OF LOCAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, ALIGNS SEGMENT ALLOCATED EQUITY WITH EMERGING STANDARDS AND CONSISTENT RISK PRINCIPLES. THE MODEL APPLIES STATISTICS-BASED RISK EVALUATION PRINCIPLES TO THE MATERIAL RISKS TO WHICH THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED. THESE CONSISTENT RISK PRINCIPLES INCLUDE CALIBRATING REQUIRED ECONOMIC CAPITAL SHOCK FACTORS TO A SPECIFIC CONFIDENCE LEVEL AND TIME HORIZON WHILE APPLYING AN INDUSTRY STANDARD METHOD FOR THE INCLUSION OF DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS AMONG RISK TYPES. ECONOMIC CAPITAL-BASED RISK ESTIMATION IS AN EVOLVING SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES HAVE EMERGED AND CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. AREAS OF EVOLVING INDUSTRY BEST PRACTICES INCLUDE STOCHASTIC LIABILITY VALUATION TECHNIQUES, ALTERNATIVE METHODOLOGIES FOR THE CALCULATION OF DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS, AND THE QUANTIFICATION OF APPROPRIATE SHOCK LEVELS. METLIFE\u2019S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ONGOING PRODUCTION AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE ECONOMIC CAPITAL MODEL AND REVIEWS ITS APPROACH PERIODICALLY TO ENSURE THAT IT REMAINS CONSISTENT WITH EMERGING INDUSTRY PRACTICE STANDARDS.  SEGMENT NET INVESTMENT INCOME IS CREDITED OR CHARGED BASED ON THE LEVEL OF ALLOCATED EQUITY; HOWEVER, CHANGES IN ALLOCATED EQUITY DO NOT IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED NET INVESTMENT INCOME, NET INCOME (LOSS), OR ADJUSTED EARNINGS.  NET INVESTMENT INCOME IS BASED UPON THE ACTUAL RESULTS OF EACH SEGMENT\u2019S SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIABLE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS ADJUSTED FOR ALLOCATED EQUITY. OTHER COSTS ARE ALLOCATED TO EACH OF THE SEGMENTS BASED UPON: (I) A REVIEW OF THE NATURE OF SUCH COSTS; (II) TIME STUDIES ANALYZING THE AMOUNT OF EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION COSTS INCURRED BY EACH SEGMENT; AND (III) COST ESTIMATES INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCT PRICING.

OVERALL SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 DECREASED FROM PRIOR PERIOD LEVELS DESPITE HIGHER SALES IN MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, DUE TO A LARGE PENSION RISK TRANSFER TRANSACTION IN THE PRIOR PERIOD IN OUR RIS BUSINESS. EXCLUDING THIS TRANSACTION, SALES IN OUR U.S. SEGMENT IMPROVED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN FUNDING AGREEMENT ISSUANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES OF STABLE VALUE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, SALES IMPROVED IN OUR GROUP BENEFITS BUSINESS. LOWER SALES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED ANNUITY PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ACCIDENT & HEALTH PRODUCT SALES, BOTH IN JAPAN, WAS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF LOWER SALES IN OUR ASIA SEGMENT. SALES IN OUR LATIN AMERICA SEGMENT IMPROVED AS A RESULT OF HIGHER SALES OF INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP LIFE PRODUCTS IN BRAZIL, MEXICO AND CHILE AND HIGHER SALES OF INDIVIDUAL ACCIDENT & HEALTH AND RETIREMENT PRODUCTS IN CHILE. IN OUR EMEA SEGMENT, SALES IMPROVED AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN OUR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS BUSINESS IN THE U.K. AND EGYPT AND OUR CREDIT LIFE BUSINESS IN TURKEY.

WE MANAGE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO USING DISCIPLINED ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT (\u201cALM\u201d) PRINCIPLES, FOCUSING ON CASH FLOW AND DURATION TO SUPPORT OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE LIABILITIES. OUR INTENT IS TO MATCH THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF LIABILITY CASH OUTFLOWS WITH INVESTED ASSETS THAT HAVE CASH INFLOWS OF COMPARABLE TIMING AND AMOUNT, WHILE OPTIMIZING RISK-ADJUSTED NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND RISK-ADJUSTED TOTAL RETURN. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARD FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS, WITH OVER 80% OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTED IN FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE (\u201cAFS\u201d) AND MORTGAGE LOANS. THESE SECURITIES AND LOANS HAVE VARYING MATURITIES AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS WHICH CAUSE THEM TO BE GENERALLY WELL SUITED FOR MATCHING THE CASH FLOW AND DURATION OF INSURANCE LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, OUR GENERAL ACCOUNT INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES, WITHIN CONTRACTHOLDER-DIRECTED EQUITY SECURITIES AND FVO SECURITIES (COLLECTIVELY, \u201cUNIT-LINKED AND FVO SECURITIES\u201d), CONTRACTHOLDER-DIRECTED EQUITY SECURITIES SUPPORTING UNIT-LINKED VARIABLE ANNUITY TYPE LIABILITIES (\u201cUNIT-LINKED INVESTMENTS\u201d), WHICH DO NOT QUALIFY AS SEPARATE ACCOUNT ASSETS. RETURNS ON THESE UNIT-LINKED INVESTMENTS, WHICH CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, INCLUDE CHANGES IN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE SUBSEQUENT TO PURCHASE, INURE TO CONTRACTHOLDERS AND ARE OFFSET IN EARNINGS BY A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES THROUGH INTEREST CREDITED TO POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES.  WE PURCHASE INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT OUR INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND NOT TO GENERATE NET INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES. HOWEVER, NET INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCURRED AND CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO CHANGES IN EXTERNAL INFLUENCES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CREDIT SPREADS AND EQUITY MARKETS; COUNTERPARTY SPECIFIC FACTORS SUCH AS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, CREDIT RATING AND COLLATERAL VALUATION; AND INTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS PORTFOLIO REBALANCING. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE LEVELS OF BOTH IMPAIRMENTS AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS SOLD.  WE ALSO USE DERIVATIVES AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR MANAGEMENT OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND INSURANCE LIABILITIES TO HEDGE CERTAIN RISKS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CREDIT SPREADS AND EQUITY MARKET LEVELS. WE USE FREESTANDING INTEREST RATE, EQUITY, CREDIT AND CURRENCY DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE CERTAIN INVESTED ASSETS AND INSURANCE LIABILITIES. A PORTION OF THESE HEDGES ARE DESIGNATED AND QUALIFY AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES, WHICH REDUCE VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS. FOR THOSE HEDGES NOT DESIGNATED AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES, CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS LEAD TO THE RECOGNITION OF FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) GENERALLY WITHOUT AN OFFSETTING GAIN OR LOSS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR THE ITEM BEING HEDGED, WHICH CREATES VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS. WE ACTIVELY EVALUATE MARKET RISK HEDGING NEEDS AND STRATEGIES TO ENSURE OUR FREE CASH FLOW AND CAPITAL OBJECTIVES ARE MET UNDER A RANGE OF MARKET CONDITIONS.  CERTAIN VARIABLE ANNUITY PRODUCTS WITH GUARANTEED MINIMUM BENEFITS CONTAIN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES THAT ARE MEASURED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE SEPARATELY FROM THE HOST VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACT, WITH CHANGES IN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES). WE USE FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE THE MARKET RISKS INHERENT IN THESE VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEES. ONGOING REFINEMENT OF THE STRATEGY MAY BE REQUIRED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NAIC RULES RELATED TO A STATUTORY ACCOUNTING ELECTION FOR DERIVATIVES THAT MITIGATE INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY RELATED TO VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEES. THE RESTRUCTURED HEDGE STRATEGY IS CLASSIFIED AS A MACRO HEDGE PROGRAM, INCLUDED IN THE NON-VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES SECTION OF THE TABLE BELOW, TO PROTECT OUR OVERALL STATUTORY CAPITAL FROM SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE VALUATION OF THESE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES INCLUDES A NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENT, WHICH IS UNHEDGED, AND CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) AND VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS, BUT DOES NOT HAVE AN ECONOMIC IMPACT ON US.  101  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES).  THE VARIABLE ANNUITY EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES AND ASSOCIATED FREESTANDING DERIVATIVE HEDGES ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \u201cVA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES.\u201d ALL OTHER DERIVATIVES THAT ARE ECONOMIC HEDGES OF CERTAIN INVESTED ASSETS AND INSURANCE LIABILITIES ARE REFERRED TO AS \u201cNON-VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES.\u201d THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE IMPACT ON NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) FROM NON-VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES AND VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES.

THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LONG-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES DECREASING IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND INCREASING IN THE PRIOR PERIOD, FAVORABLY IMPACTING RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND OPTIONS.  THE UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) ON VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES WAS $146 MILLION ($115 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX). THIS WAS DUE TO AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE OF $169 MILLION ($134 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, NET OF FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES HEDGING MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A FAVORABLE CHANGE OF $12 MILLION ($9 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN THE NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENT ON EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, AND A FAVORABLE CHANGE OF $11 MILLION, ($9 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN OTHER RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. OTHER RISKS RELATE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPACT OF POLICYHOLDER BEHAVIOR AND OTHER NON-MARKET RISKS THAT GENERALLY CANNOT BE HEDGED.  THE AFOREMENTIONED $169 MILLION ($134 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) UNFAVORABLE CHANGE REFLECTS A $275 MILLION ($217 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $106 MILLION ($84 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) FAVORABLE CHANGE IN FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES HEDGING MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES.  THE PRIMARY CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  LONG-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES DECREASED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND INCREASED IN THE PRIOR PERIOD, CONTRIBUTING TO A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES AND AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE 30-YEAR U.S. SWAP RATE DECREASED 37 BASIS POINTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND INCREASED 11 BASIS POINTS IN THE PRIOR PERIOD.  \u2022  CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CONTRIBUTED TO A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES AND AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES RELATED TO THE ASSUMED VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEES FROM OUR FORMER OPERATING JOINT VENTURE IN JAPAN. FOR EXAMPLE, THE JAPANESE YEN STRENGTHENED AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR BY 3% IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND WEAKENED BY 4% IN THE PRIOR PERIOD.  THE AFOREMENTIONED $11 MILLION ($9 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) FAVORABLE CHANGE IN OTHER RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES REFLECTS A COMBINATION OF FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE FEES BEING DEDUCTED FROM ACCOUNTS, CHANGES IN THE BENEFIT BASE, PREMIUMS, LAPSES, WITHDRAWALS AND DEATHS.  102  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE AFOREMENTIONED $12 MILLION ($9 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) FAVORABLE CHANGE IN THE NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENT ON EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES RESULTED FROM A FAVORABLE CHANGE OF $34 MILLION, BEFORE INCOME TAX, AS A RESULT OF MODEL CHANGES AND CHANGES IN CAPITAL MARKET INPUTS, SUCH AS LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES AND KEY EQUITY INDEX LEVELS, ON VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE OF $22 MILLION, BEFORE INCOME TAX, RELATED TO CHANGES IN OUR OWN CREDIT SPREAD.  WHEN EQUITY INDEX LEVELS DECREASE IN ISOLATION, THE VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEES BECOME MORE VALUABLE TO POLICYHOLDERS, WHICH RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN THE UNDISCOUNTED EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE LIABILITY. DISCOUNTING THIS UNFAVORABLE CHANGE BY THE RISK ADJUSTED RATE YIELDS A SMALLER LOSS THAN BY DISCOUNTING AT THE RISK-FREE RATE, THUS CREATING A GAIN FROM INCLUDING AN ADJUSTMENT FOR NONPERFORMANCE RISK.  WHEN THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE DECREASES IN ISOLATION, DISCOUNTING THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE LIABILITY PRODUCES A HIGHER VALUATION OF THE LIABILITY THAN IF THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE HAD REMAINED CONSTANT. DISCOUNTING THIS UNFAVORABLE CHANGE BY THE RISK ADJUSTED RATE YIELDS A SMALLER LOSS THAN BY DISCOUNTING AT THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE, THUS CREATING A GAIN FROM INCLUDING AN ADJUSTMENT FOR NONPERFORMANCE RISK.  WHEN OUR OWN CREDIT SPREAD INCREASES IN ISOLATION, DISCOUNTING THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE LIABILITY PRODUCES A LOWER VALUATION OF THE LIABILITY THAN IF OUR OWN CREDIT SPREAD HAD REMAINED CONSTANT. AS A RESULT, A GAIN IS CREATED FROM INCLUDING AN ADJUSTMENT FOR NONPERFORMANCE RISK. FOR EACH OF THESE PRIMARY MARKET DRIVERS, THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OCCURS WHEN THE DRIVER MOVES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  NET INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).  THE FAVORABLE CHANGE IN NET INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) OF $288 MILLION ($228 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) PRIMARILY REFLECTS PRIOR PERIOD LOSSES ON FVO BRIGHTHOUSE COMMON STOCK DISPOSED OF IN JUNE 2018, AS WELL AS HIGHER GAINS ON SALES OF FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES AFS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD VERSUS THE PRIOR PERIOD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER GAINS ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURES.  DIVESTED BUSINESSES  . INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX RELATED TO THE DIVESTED BUSINESSES, EXCLUDING NET INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) AND NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES), INCREASED $77 MILLION ($61 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) TO A LOSS OF $6 MILLION ($5 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN THE CURRENT PERIOD FROM A LOSS OF $83 MILLION ($66 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN THE PRIOR PERIOD. INCLUDED IN THIS INCREASE WAS A DECREASE IN TOTAL EXPENSES OF $77 MILLION, BEFORE INCOME TAX. DIVESTED BUSINESSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE ACTIVITY RELATED TO THE SEPARATION OF BRIGHTHOUSE FINANCIAL, INC. (THE \u201cSEPARATION\u201d).  TAXES.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX WAS 24%. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DIFFERED FROM THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO TAX CHARGES FROM FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT DIFFERENT RATES THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE AND THE IMPACT FROM THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL METLIFE HONG KONG, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO NON-TAXABLE INVESTMENT INCOME AND TAX CREDITS. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX WAS 19%. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DIFFERED FROM THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO NON-TAXABLE INVESTMENT INCOME, TAX CREDITS AND A NON-CASH TRANSFER OF ASSETS FROM A WHOLLY-OWNED U.K. INVESTMENT SUBSIDIARY TO ITS U.S. PARENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TAX CHARGES FROM FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT DIFFERENT RATES THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE AND A NON-DEDUCTIBLE LOSS INCURRED ON THE MARK-TO-MARKET AND DISPOSITION OF FVO BRIGHTHOUSE COMMON STOCK.  ADJUSTED EARNINGS  . AS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN \u201c\u2014 NON-GAAP AND OTHER FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES,\u201d WE USE ADJUSTED EARNINGS, WHICH DOES NOT EQUATE TO NET INCOME (LOSS), AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, TO ANALYZE OUR PERFORMANCE, EVALUATE SEGMENT PERFORMANCE, AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS AND OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES BASED ON ADJUSTED EARNINGS, AS WE MEASURE IT FOR MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, ENHANCES THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PERFORMANCE BY HIGHLIGHTING THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE UNDERLYING PROFITABILITY DRIVERS OF THE BUSINESS. ADJUSTED EARNINGS AND OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES BASED ON ADJUSTED EARNINGS ALLOW ANALYSIS OF OUR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND FACILITATE COMPARISONS TO INDUSTRY RESULTS. ADJUSTED EARNINGS SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME (LOSS). ADJUSTED EARNINGS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS SUBSTITUTES FOR NET INCOME (LOSS) AVAILABLE TO METLIFE, INC.\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS. ADJUSTED EARNINGS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS DECREASED $7 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX, TO $1,319 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $1,326 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  103  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED WITH THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, NET INCOME (LOSS) INCREASED $980 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE CHANGES IN NET INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) AND NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES).  NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES).  THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE IMPACT ON NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) FROM NON-VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES AND VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES.

THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN INTEREST RATE IMPACT DUE TO: (I) LONG-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES DECREASING IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND INCREASING IN THE PRIOR PERIOD, FAVORABLY IMPACTING RECEIVE FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS, OPTIONS AND TOTAL RATE OF RETURN SWAPS; AND (II) MID-TERM RATES DECREASING IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND INCREASING IN THE PRIOR PERIOD, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING INTEREST RATE CAPS. IN ADDITION, CREDIT SPREADS NARROWED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND WIDENED IN THE PRIOR PERIOD, FAVORABLY IMPACTING WRITTEN CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS USED IN REPLICATIONS. THESE FAVORABLE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF EQUITY MARKETS INCREASING MORE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD VERSUS THE PRIOR PERIOD, UNFAVORABLY IMPACTING EQUITY OPTIONS ACQUIRED PRIMARILY AS PART OF OUR MACRO HEDGE PROGRAM. ALSO, THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN THE CURRENT PERIOD VERSUS THE PRIOR PERIOD RELATIVE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED FOREIGN CURRENCY SWAPS AND FORWARDS THAT PRIMARILY HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BONDS. THERE WAS ALSO A CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS, UNFAVORABLY IMPACTING NON-VA EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES RELATED TO FUNDS WITHHELD ON A CERTAIN REINSURANCE AGREEMENT. BECAUSE CERTAIN OF THESE HEDGING STRATEGIES ARE NOT DESIGNATED OR DO NOT QUALIFY AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES, THE CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) WITHOUT AN OFFSETTING GAIN OR LOSS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED.  THE UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) ON VA PROGRAM DERIVATIVES WAS $429 MILLION ($339 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX). THIS WAS DUE TO AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE OF $328 MILLION ($259 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES HEDGING MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, NET OF MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE OF $70 MILLION ($55 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN THE NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENT ON EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, AND AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE OF $31 MILLION, ($24 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) IN OTHER RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. OTHER RISKS RELATE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPACT OF POLICYHOLDER BEHAVIOR AND OTHER NON-MARKET RISKS THAT GENERALLY CANNOT BE HEDGED.  THE AFOREMENTIONED $328 MILLION ($259 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) UNFAVORABLE CHANGE REFLECTS A $442 MILLION ($349 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES HEDGING MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $114 MILLION ($90 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) FAVORABLE CHANGE IN MARKET RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES.  104  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE PRIMARY CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  KEY EQUITY INDEX LEVELS INCREASED MORE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD VERSUS THE PRIOR PERIOD, CONTRIBUTING TO AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES AND A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE S&P 500 INDEX INCREASED 17% IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND 2% IN THE PRIOR PERIOD.  \u2022  LONG-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES DECREASED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND INCREASED IN THE PRIOR PERIOD, CONTRIBUTING TO A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES AND AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE 30-YEAR U.S. SWAP RATE DECREASED 62 BASIS POINTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND INCREASED 39 BASIS POINTS IN THE PRIOR PERIOD.  \u2022  CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CONTRIBUTED TO AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES AND A FAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES RELATED TO THE ASSUMED VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEES FROM OUR FORMER OPERATING JOINT VENTURE IN JAPAN. FOR EXAMPLE, THE JAPANESE YEN STRENGTHENED AGAINST THE EURO BY 2% IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND BY 4% IN THE PRIOR PERIOD.  THE AFOREMENTIONED $31 MILLION ($24 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN OTHER RISKS IN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES REFLECTS INCREASED GUARANTEE CLAIMS COSTS AND A COMBINATION OF OTHER FACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE FEES BEING DEDUCTED FROM ACCOUNTS, CHANGES IN THE BENEFIT BASE, PREMIUMS, LAPSES, WITHDRAWALS AND DEATHS.  THE AFOREMENTIONED $70 MILLION ($55 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN THE NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENT ON EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES RESULTED FROM AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE OF $70 MILLION, BEFORE INCOME TAX, RELATED TO CHANGES IN OUR OWN CREDIT SPREAD.  NET INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES).  THE FAVORABLE CHANGE IN NET INVESTMENT GAINS (LOSSES) OF $636 MILLION ($502 MILLION, NET OF INCOME TAX) PRIMARILY REFLECTS PRIOR PERIOD LOSSES ON FVO BRIGHTHOUSE COMMON STOCK DISPOSED OF IN JUNE 2018, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN MARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES ON EQUITY SECURITIES, BOTH OF WHICH WERE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH NET INCOME. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WERE GAINS ON SALES OF FIXED MATURITY SECURITIES AFS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD VERSUS LOSSES IN THE PRIOR PERIOD. THESE FAVORABLE CHANGES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER GAINS ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURES.  DIVESTED BUSINESSES  .

HIGHER FEE INCOME IN OUR ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA SEGMENTS WAS OFFSET BY LOWER FEE INCOME IN OUR METLIFE HOLDINGS SEGMENT. A DECREASE IN EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 2019 ABATEMENT OF THE ANNUAL HEALTH INSURER FEE UNDER THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (\u201cPPACA\u201d).

INVESTMENT YIELDS WERE POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY HIGHER RETURNS ON PRIVATE EQUITIES AND FVO SECURITIES, AS WELL AS HIGHER PREPAYMENT FEES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER YIELDS ON FIXED INCOME SECURITIES AND LOWER INCOME FROM DERIVATIVES. IN ADDITION, LOWER EARNINGS ON OUR SECURITIES LENDING PROGRAM RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM LOWER MARGINS, DUE TO A FLATTER YIELD CURVE. HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST CREDITED RATES ON OUR DEPOSIT-TYPE LIABILITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER RATES ON OUR LONG-DURATION LIABILITIES, DROVE A NET INCREASE IN INTEREST CREDITED EXPENSES.

WE MONITOR OUR MORTGAGE LOAN INVESTMENTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS, INCLUDING A REVIEW OF LOANS THAT ARE CURRENT, PAST DUE, RESTRUCTURED AND UNDER FORECLOSURE. SEE NOTE  6  OF THE NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORTGAGE LOANS BY CREDIT QUALITY INDICATOR, PAST DUE AND NONACCRUAL MORTGAGE LOANS, IMPAIRED MORTGAGE LOANS, AND CARRYING VALUE OF FORECLOSED MORTGAGE LOANS.  132  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE REVIEW OUR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THESE REVIEWS MAY INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROPERTY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RENT ROLL, LEASE ROLLOVER ANALYSIS, PROPERTY INSPECTIONS, MARKET ANALYSIS, ESTIMATED VALUATIONS OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS, DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIOS AND TENANT CREDITWORTHINESS. THE MONITORING PROCESS FOCUSES ON HIGHER RISK LOANS, WHICH INCLUDE THOSE THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS RESTRUCTURED, DELINQUENT OR IN FORECLOSURE, AS WELL AS LOANS WITH HIGHER LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS AND LOWER DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIOS. THE MONITORING PROCESS FOR AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE LOANS IS GENERALLY SIMILAR, WITH A FOCUS ON HIGHER RISK LOANS, SUCH AS LOANS WITH HIGHER LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS, INCLUDING REVIEWS ON A GEOGRAPHIC AND SECTOR BASIS. WE REVIEW OUR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. SEE NOTE 8 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT FOR INFORMATION ON OUR EVALUATION OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY.  LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS AND DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIOS ARE COMMON MEASURES IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALITY OF COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS ARE A COMMON MEASURE IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALITY OF AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE LOANS. LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS COMPARE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOAN TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. A LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO GREATER THAN 100% INDICATES THAT THE LOAN AMOUNT IS GREATER THAN THE COLLATERAL VALUE. A LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO OF LESS THAN 100% INDICATES AN EXCESS OF COLLATERAL VALUE OVER THE LOAN AMOUNT. GENERALLY, THE HIGHER THE LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO, THE HIGHER THE RISK OF EXPERIENCING A CREDIT LOSS. THE DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO COMPARES A PROPERTY\u2019S NET OPERATING INCOME TO AMOUNTS NEEDED TO SERVICE THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST DUE UNDER THE LOAN. GENERALLY, THE LOWER THE DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO, THE HIGHER THE RISK OF EXPERIENCING A CREDIT LOSS. FOR OUR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, OUR AVERAGE LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO WAS  55%  AT BOTH  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND OUR AVERAGE DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO WAS  2.4X  AND  2.5X  FOR  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO, AS WELL AS THE VALUES UTILIZED IN CALCULATING THE RATIO, IS UPDATED ANNUALLY, ON A ROLLING BASIS, WITH A PORTION OF THE PORTFOLIO UPDATED EACH QUARTER. IN ADDITION, THE LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO IS ROUTINELY UPDATED FOR ALL BUT THE LOWEST RISK LOANS AS PART OF OUR ONGOING REVIEW OF OUR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIO. FOR OUR AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE LOANS, OUR AVERAGE LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO WAS  46%  AT BOTH  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THE VALUES UTILIZED IN CALCULATING THE AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE LOAN LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO ARE DEVELOPED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ONGOING REVIEW OF THE AGRICULTURAL LOAN PORTFOLIO AND ARE ROUTINELY UPDATED.  MORTGAGE LOAN VALUATION ALLOWANCES.  OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED BOTH ON A LOAN SPECIFIC BASIS FOR THOSE LOANS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHERE A PROPERTY SPECIFIC OR MARKET SPECIFIC RISK HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT COULD LIKELY RESULT IN A FUTURE LOSS, AS WELL AS FOR POOLS OF LOANS WITH SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS WHERE A PROPERTY SPECIFIC OR MARKET SPECIFIC RISK HAS NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED, BUT FOR WHICH WE EXPECT TO INCUR A LOSS. ACCORDINGLY, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS PROVIDED TO ABSORB THESE ESTIMATED PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES.  THE DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES IS BASED UPON OUR PERIODIC EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT OF KNOWN AND INHERENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR LOAN PORTFOLIOS. SUCH EVALUATIONS AND ASSESSMENTS ARE BASED UPON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR EXPERIENCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, DEFAULTS AND LOSS SEVERITY, AND LOSS EXPECTATIONS FOR LOANS WITH SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS. THESE EVALUATIONS AND ASSESSMENTS ARE REVISED AS CONDITIONS CHANGE AND NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, WHICH CAN CAUSE THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES TO INCREASE OR DECREASE OVER TIME AS SUCH EVALUATIONS ARE REVISED. NEGATIVE CREDIT MIGRATION, INCLUDING AN ACTUAL OR EXPECTED INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF PROBLEM LOANS, WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE. POSITIVE CREDIT MIGRATION, INCLUDING AN ACTUAL OR EXPECTED DECREASE IN THE LEVEL OF PROBLEM LOANS, WILL RESULT IN A DECREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  SEE NOTE  6  OF THE NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT HOW VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED AND MONITORED, AND ACTIVITY IN AND BALANCES OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE, AS OF AND FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018.  REAL ESTATE AND REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURES  REAL ESTATE AND REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURES IS COMPRISED OF WHOLLY-OWNED REAL ESTATE AND JOINT VENTURES WITH INTERESTS IN SINGLE PROPERTY INCOME-PRODUCING REAL ESTATE AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, JOINT VENTURES WITH INTERESTS IN MULTI-PROPERTY PROJECTS WITH VARYING STRATEGIES RANGING FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROPERTIES TO THE OPERATION OF INCOME-PRODUCING PROPERTIES, AS WELL AS A RUNOFF PORTFOLIO. WE DIVERSIFY OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS BY BOTH GEOGRAPHIC REGION AND PROPERTY TYPE TO REDUCE RISK OF CONCENTRATION. THE CARRYING VALUE OF REAL ESTATE AND REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURES WAS  $10.3 BILLION  AND  $9.7 BILLION  , OR  2.2%  AND  2.1%  OF CASH AND INVESTED ASSETS, AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY  SEE NOTE  8  OF THE NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DERIVATIVES MEASURED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND THEIR CORRESPONDING FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.  THE VALUATION OF LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES INVOLVES THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND GENERALLY REQUIRES A HIGHER DEGREE OF MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT OR ESTIMATION THAN THE VALUATIONS OF LEVEL 1 AND LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES. ALTHOUGH LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE UNOBSERVABLE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE WHEN PRICING SUCH INSTRUMENTS AND ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE USE OF DIFFERENT INPUTS OR METHODOLOGIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT NET INCOME.  DERIVATIVES CATEGORIZED AS LEVEL 3 AT  JUNE 30, 2019  INCLUDE: INTEREST RATE FORWARDS WITH MATURITIES WHICH EXTEND BEYOND THE OBSERVABLE PORTION OF THE YIELD CURVE; INTEREST RATE TOTAL RETURN SWAPS WITH UNOBSERVABLE REPURCHASE RATES; FOREIGN CURRENCY SWAPS AND FORWARDS WITH CERTAIN UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, INCLUDING THE UNOBSERVABLE PORTION OF THE YIELD CURVE; CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS PRICED USING UNOBSERVABLE CREDIT SPREADS, OR THAT ARE PRICED THROUGH INDEPENDENT BROKER QUOTATIONS; EQUITY VARIANCE SWAPS WITH UNOBSERVABLE VOLATILITY INPUTS; AND EQUITY INDEX OPTIONS WITH UNOBSERVABLE CORRELATION INPUTS. AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , LESS THAN 1% OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVES WAS PRICED THROUGH INDEPENDENT BROKER QUOTATIONS.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT INPUTS, WHICH ARE OBSERVABLE, INCLUDE EQUITY INDEX LEVELS, EQUITY VOLATILITY AND THE SWAP YIELD CURVES. WE VALIDATE THE REASONABLENESS OF THESE INPUTS BY VALUING THE POSITIONS USING INTERNAL MODELS AND COMPARING THE RESULTS TO BROKER QUOTATIONS.  135  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE GAIN (LOSS) ON LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVES, PERCENTAGE OF GAIN (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO OBSERVABLE AND UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS, AND THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF OBSERVABLE GAIN (LOSS) ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.

THE FAVORABLE CHANGES IN NET GAINS (LOSSES) ON WRITTEN CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS OF $85 MILLION AND $265 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WERE DUE TO CERTAIN CREDIT SPREADS ON CERTAIN CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS USED AS REPLICATIONS NARROWING IN THE CURRENT PERIODS AS COMPARED TO WIDENING IN THE PRIOR PERIODS.  THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT AT RISK RELATED TO OUR WRITTEN CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS IS EQUAL TO THE CORRESPONDING GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNT. IN A REPLICATION TRANSACTION, WE PAIR AN ASSET ON OUR BALANCE SHEET WITH A WRITTEN CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP TO SYNTHETICALLY REPLICATE A CORPORATE BOND, A CORE ASSET HOLDING OF LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES. REPLICATIONS ARE ENTERED INTO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDELINES APPROVED BY STATE INSURANCE REGULATORS AND THE NAIC AND ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN MANAGING THE OVERALL CORPORATE CREDIT RISK WITHIN THE COMPANY. IN ORDER TO MATCH OUR LONG-DATED INSURANCE LIABILITIES, WE SEEK TO BUY LONG-DATED CORPORATE BONDS. IN SOME INSTANCES, THESE MAY NOT BE READILY AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET, OR THEY MAY BE ISSUED BY CORPORATIONS TO WHICH WE ALREADY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE CREDIT EXPOSURE. FOR EXAMPLE, BY PURCHASING TREASURY BONDS (OR OTHER HIGH-QUALITY ASSETS) AND ASSOCIATING THEM WITH WRITTEN CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS ON THE DESIRED CORPORATE CREDIT NAME, WE CAN REPLICATE THE DESIRED BOND EXPOSURES AND MEET OUR ALM NEEDS. IN ADDITION, GIVEN THE SHORTER TENOR OF THE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS (GENERALLY FIVE-YEAR TENORS) VERSUS A LONG DATED CORPORATE BOND, WE HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN MANAGING OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES.

DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING RISKS AND THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DETERMINATION OF ACTUARIAL LIABILITIES, WE CANNOT PRECISELY DETERMINE THE AMOUNTS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE PAID WITH RESPECT TO THESE ACTUARIAL LIABILITIES, AND THE ULTIMATE AMOUNTS MAY VARY FROM THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS, PARTICULARLY WHEN PAYMENTS MAY NOT OCCUR UNTIL WELL INTO THE FUTURE.  WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR ESTIMATES OF ACTUARIAL LIABILITIES FOR FUTURE BENEFITS AND COMPARE THEM WITH OUR ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. WE REVISE ESTIMATES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED OR REQUIRED UNDER GAAP, IF WE DETERMINE THAT FUTURE EXPECTED EXPERIENCE DIFFERS FROM ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ACTUARIAL LIABILITIES. WE CHARGE OR CREDIT CHANGES IN OUR LIABILITIES TO EXPENSES IN THE PERIOD THE LIABILITIES ARE ESTABLISHED OR RE-ESTIMATED. IF THE LIABILITIES ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED FOR FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS PROVE INADEQUATE, WE MUST INCREASE THEM. SUCH AN INCREASE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  WE HAVE EXPERIENCED, AND WILL LIKELY IN THE FUTURE EXPERIENCE, CATASTROPHE LOSSES AND POSSIBLY ACTS OF TERRORISM, AS WELL AS TURBULENT FINANCIAL MARKETS THAT MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. DUE TO THEIR NATURE, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE INCIDENCE, TIMING, SEVERITY OR AMOUNT OF LOSSES FROM CATASTROPHES AND ACTS OF TERRORISM, BUT WE MAKE BROAD USE OF CATASTROPHIC AND NON-CATASTROPHIC REINSURANCE TO MANAGE RISK FROM THESE PERILS. WE ALSO USE HEDGING, REINSURANCE AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES TO MITIGATE FINANCIAL MARKET VOLATILITY.  138  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SEE \u201cBUSINESS \u2014 REGULATION \u2014 INSURANCE REGULATION \u2014 POLICY AND CONTRACT RESERVE ADEQUACY ANALYSIS\u201d INCLUDED IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING REQUIRED ANALYSES OF THE ADEQUACY OF STATUTORY RESERVES OF OUR INSURANCE OPERATIONS.

U.S.  AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER INSURANCE POLICIES FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE COMPRISED OF GROUP INSURANCE AND ANNUITIES, AS WELL AS PROPERTY AND CASUALTY POLICIES. FOR GROUP INSURANCE, FUTURE POLICYHOLDER BENEFITS ARE COMPRISED MAINLY OF LIABILITIES FOR DISABLED LIVES UNDER DISABILITY WAIVER OF PREMIUM POLICY PROVISIONS, LIABILITIES FOR SURVIVOR INCOME BENEFIT INSURANCE, ACTIVE LIFE POLICIES AND PREMIUM STABILIZATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCY LIABILITIES HELD UNDER LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS. FOR GROUP ANNUITY CONTRACTS, FUTURE POLICYHOLDER BENEFITS ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO PAYOUT ANNUITIES, INCLUDING PENSION RISK TRANSFERS, STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT ANNUITIES AND INSTITUTIONAL INCOME ANNUITIES. THERE IS NO INTEREST RATE CREDITING FLEXIBILITY ON THESE LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, A SUSTAINED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT EARNINGS; HOWEVER, WE MITIGATE OUR RISKS BY APPLYING VARIOUS ALM STRATEGIES, INCLUDING THE USE OF VARIOUS INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE POSITIONS. THE COMPONENTS OF FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS RELATED TO OUR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY POLICIES ARE LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID CLAIMS, ESTIMATED BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS RATES OF CLAIM FREQUENCIES, LEVELS OF SEVERITIES, INFLATION, JUDICIAL TRENDS, LEGISLATIVE CHANGES OR REGULATORY DECISIONS. ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TO LOSSES FOR EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, AND WE CONSIDER THE EFFECTS OF CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS, ANTICIPATED TRENDS AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, REDUCED FOR ANTICIPATED SALVAGE AND SUBROGATION.  ASIA  FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE HELD PRIMARILY FOR TRADITIONAL LIFE, ENDOWMENT, ANNUITY AND ACCIDENT & HEALTH CONTRACTS. THEY ARE ALSO HELD FOR TOTAL RETURN PASS-THROUGH PROVISIONS INCLUDED IN CERTAIN UNIVERSAL LIFE AND SAVINGS PRODUCTS. THEY INCLUDE CERTAIN LIABILITIES FOR VARIABLE ANNUITY AND VARIABLE LIFE GUARANTEES OF MINIMUM DEATH BENEFITS, AND LONGEVITY GUARANTEES. FACTORS IMPACTING THESE LIABILITIES INCLUDE SUSTAINED PERIODS OF YIELDS LOWER THAN EXPECTED, LOWER THAN EXPECTED ASSET REINVESTMENT RATES, MARKET VOLATILITY, ACTUAL LAPSES RESULTING IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED INCOME, AND ACTUAL MORTALITY OR MORBIDITY RESULTING IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS. WE MITIGATE OUR RISKS BY APPLYING VARIOUS ALM STRATEGIES AND BY THE USE OF REINSURANCE.  LATIN AMERICA  FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE HELD PRIMARILY FOR IMMEDIATE ANNUITIES IN CHILE, ARGENTINA AND MEXICO AND TRADITIONAL LIFE CONTRACTS MAINLY IN MEXICO, BRAZIL AND COLOMBIA. THERE ARE ALSO LIABILITIES HELD FOR TOTAL RETURN PASS-THROUGH PROVISIONS INCLUDED IN CERTAIN UNIVERSAL LIFE AND SAVINGS PRODUCTS IN MEXICO. THERE IS LIMITED INTEREST RATE CREDITING FLEXIBILITY ON THE IMMEDIATE ANNUITY AND TRADITIONAL LIFE LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, SUSTAINED PERIODS OF YIELDS LOWER THAN EXPECTED COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT EARNINGS; HOWEVER, WE MITIGATE OUR RISKS BY APPLYING VARIOUS ALM STRATEGIES. OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING THESE LIABILITIES ARE ACTUAL MORTALITY RESULTING IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND ACTUAL LAPSES RESULTING IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED INCOME.  EMEA  FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS FOR THIS SEGMENT INCLUDE UNEARNED PREMIUM RESERVES FOR GROUP LIFE AND CREDIT INSURANCE CONTRACTS. FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS ARE ALSO HELD FOR TRADITIONAL LIFE, ENDOWMENT AND ANNUITY CONTRACTS WITH SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY RISK AND ACCIDENT & HEALTH CONTRACTS. FACTORS IMPACTING THESE LIABILITIES INCLUDE LOWER THAN EXPECTED ASSET REINVESTMENT RATES, MARKET VOLATILITY, ACTUAL LAPSES RESULTING IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED INCOME, AND ACTUAL MORTALITY OR MORBIDITY RESULTING IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS. WE MITIGATE OUR RISKS BY HAVING PREMIUMS WHICH ARE ADJUSTABLE OR CANCELLABLE IN SOME CASES, APPLYING VARIOUS ALM STRATEGIES AND BY THE USE OF REINSURANCE.  139  TABLE OF CONTENTS  METLIFE HOLDINGS  FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS FOR THE LIFE BUSINESS ARE COMPRISED MAINLY OF LIABILITIES FOR TRADITIONAL LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS. IN ORDER TO MANAGE RISK, WE HAVE OFTEN REINSURED A PORTION OF THE MORTALITY RISK ON LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES. WE ROUTINELY EVALUATE OUR REINSURANCE PROGRAMS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN INCREASES OR DECREASES TO EXISTING COVERAGE. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO VARIOUS INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE POSITIONS TO MITIGATE THE RISK THAT INVESTMENT OF PREMIUMS RECEIVED AND REINVESTMENT OF MATURING ASSETS OVER THE LIFE OF THE POLICY WILL BE AT RATES BELOW THOSE ASSUMED IN THE ORIGINAL PRICING OF THESE CONTRACTS. FOR THE ANNUITIES BUSINESS, FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS ARE COMPRISED MAINLY OF LIABILITIES FOR LIFE-CONTINGENT INCOME ANNUITIES AND LIABILITIES FOR THE VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEED MINIMUM BENEFITS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS INSURANCE. OTHER FUTURE POLICYHOLDER BENEFITS ARE COMPRISED MAINLY OF LIABILITIES FOR DISABLED LIVES UNDER DISABILITY WAIVER OF PREMIUM POLICY PROVISIONS, AND ACTIVE LIFE POLICIES. IN ADDITION, FOR OUR OTHER PRODUCTS, FUTURE POLICYHOLDER BENEFITS RELATED TO THE REINSURANCE OF OUR FORMER JAPAN JOINT VENTURE ARE COMPRISED OF LIABILITIES FOR THE VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEED MINIMUM BENEFITS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS INSURANCE.  CORPORATE & OTHER  FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS PRIMARILY INCLUDE LIABILITIES FOR OTHER REINSURANCE BUSINESS.  POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES  POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES ARE GENERALLY EQUAL TO THE ACCOUNT VALUE, WHICH INCLUDES ACCRUED INTEREST CREDITED, BUT EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF ANY APPLICABLE CHARGE THAT MAY BE INCURRED UPON SURRENDER.

A DISCUSSION OF POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES BY SEGMENT FOLLOWS.  U.S.  POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES IN THIS SEGMENT ARE COMPRISED OF FUNDING AGREEMENTS, RETAINED ASSET ACCOUNTS, UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES, THE FIXED ACCOUNT OF VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES AND SPECIALIZED LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS FOR BENEFIT PROGRAMS.  GROUP BENEFITS  POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES IN THIS BUSINESS ARE HELD FOR RETAINED ASSET ACCOUNTS, UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES, THE FIXED ACCOUNT OF VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES AND SPECIALIZED LIFE INSURANCE PRODUCTS FOR BENEFIT PROGRAMS. POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES ARE CREDITED INTEREST AT A RATE WE DETERMINE, WHICH IS INFLUENCED BY CURRENT MARKET RATES. A SUSTAINED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT LIABILITIES AND EARNINGS AS A RESULT OF THE MINIMUM CREDITED RATE GUARANTEES PRESENT IN MOST OF THESE POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES. WE HAVE VARIOUS INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE POSITIONS TO PARTIALLY MITIGATE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH A SCENARIO.

INTEREST CREDITING RATES VARY BY TYPE OF CONTRACT, AND CAN BE FIXED OR VARIABLE. VARIABLE INTEREST CREDITING RATES ARE GENERALLY TIED TO AN EXTERNAL INDEX, MOST COMMONLY (1-MONTH OR 3-MONTH) LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE. WE ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISKS, AS WELL AS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK, WHEN GUARANTEEING PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND RETURN OF PRINCIPAL AT THE CONTRACTUAL MATURITY DATE. WE MAY INVEST IN FLOATING RATE ASSETS OR ENTER INTO RECEIVE-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAPS, ALSO TIED TO EXTERNAL INDICES, AS WELL AS INTEREST RATE CAPS, TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES. WE ALSO MITIGATE OUR RISKS BY APPLYING VARIOUS ALM STRATEGIES AND SEEK TO HEDGE ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK THROUGH THE USE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES, INCLUDING CROSS CURRENCY SWAPS.  140  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE BREAKDOWN OF ACCOUNT VALUE SUBJECT TO MINIMUM GUARANTEED CREDITING RATES FOR RIS.

ALSO INCLUDED ARE CERTAIN LIABILITIES FOR RETIREMENT AND SAVINGS PRODUCTS SOLD IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN ASIA THAT GENERALLY ARE SOLD WITH MINIMUM CREDITED RATE GUARANTEES. LIABILITIES FOR GUARANTEES ON CERTAIN VARIABLE ANNUITIES IN ASIA ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES AND RECORDED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND ARE ALSO INCLUDED WITHIN POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES. A SUSTAINED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT LIABILITIES AND EARNINGS AS A RESULT OF THE MINIMUM CREDITED RATE GUARANTEES PRESENT IN MOST OF THESE POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES. WE MITIGATE OUR RISKS BY APPLYING VARIOUS ALM STRATEGIES AND WITH REINSURANCE. LIABILITIES FOR UNIT-LINKED INVESTMENTS ARE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSOCIATED UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS, AS THE RETURN ON ASSETS IS GENERALLY PASSED DIRECTLY TO THE POLICYHOLDER.

SOME OF THE DEFERRED ANNUITIES IN BRAZIL ARE UNIT-LINKED INVESTMENTS THAT DO NOT MEET THE GAAP DEFINITION OF SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. LIABILITIES FOR UNIT-LINKED INVESTMENTS ARE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSOCIATED INVESTMENTS, AS THE RETURN ON ASSETS IS GENERALLY PASSED DIRECTLY TO THE POLICYHOLDER. MANY OF THE OTHER LIABILITIES HAVE MINIMUM CREDITED RATE GUARANTEES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT LIABILITIES AND EARNINGS IN A SUSTAINED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT.  EMEA  POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES IN THIS SEGMENT ARE HELD MOSTLY FOR UNIVERSAL LIFE, DEFERRED ANNUITY, PENSION PRODUCTS, AND UNIT-LINKED INVESTMENTS THAT DO NOT MEET THE GAAP DEFINITION OF SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. THEY ARE ALSO HELD FOR ENDOWMENT PRODUCTS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY RISK. A SUSTAINED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT LIABILITIES AND EARNINGS AS A RESULT OF THE MINIMUM CREDITED RATE GUARANTEES PRESENT IN MANY OF THESE POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES. WE MITIGATE OUR RISKS BY APPLYING VARIOUS ALM STRATEGIES. LIABILITIES FOR UNIT-LINKED INVESTMENTS ARE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSOCIATED INVESTMENTS, AS THE RETURN ON ASSETS IS GENERALLY PASSED DIRECTLY TO THE POLICYHOLDER.  141  TABLE OF CONTENTS  METLIFE HOLDINGS  LIFE POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES ARE HELD FOR RETAINED ASSET ACCOUNTS, UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES, THE FIXED ACCOUNT OF VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES, AND FUNDING AGREEMENTS. FOR ANNUITIES, POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES ARE HELD FOR FIXED DEFERRED ANNUITIES, THE FIXED ACCOUNT PORTION OF VARIABLE ANNUITIES, NON-LIFE CONTINGENT INCOME ANNUITIES, AND EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES RELATED TO VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEES. INTEREST IS CREDITED TO THE POLICYHOLDER\u2019S ACCOUNT AT INTEREST RATES WE DETERMINE WHICH ARE INFLUENCED BY CURRENT MARKET RATES, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED MINIMUMS. A SUSTAINED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT LIABILITIES AND EARNINGS AS A RESULT OF THE MINIMUM CREDITED RATE GUARANTEES PRESENT IN MOST OF THESE POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES. WE HAVE VARIOUS INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE POSITIONS TO PARTIALLY MITIGATE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH A SCENARIO. ADDITIONALLY, FOR OUR OTHER PRODUCTS, POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES ARE HELD FOR VARIABLE ANNUITY GUARANTEES ASSUMED FROM A FORMER OPERATING JOINT VENTURE IN JAPAN THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES.  THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE BREAKDOWN OF ACCOUNT VALUE SUBJECT TO MINIMUM GUARANTEED CREDITING RATES FOR THE METLIFE HOLDINGS SEGMENT.

IN SOME CASES, THE BENEFIT BASE MAY BE INCREASED BY ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS, BONUS AMOUNTS, ACCRUALS OR OPTIONAL MARKET VALUE RESETS. SEE NOTE  4  OF THE NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS NOTES 1 AND 4 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  CERTAIN GUARANTEES, INCLUDING PORTIONS THEREOF, HAVE INSURANCE LIABILITIES ESTABLISHED THAT ARE INCLUDED IN FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS. GUARANTEES ACCOUNTED FOR IN THIS MANNER INCLUDE GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH BENEFITS (\u201cGMDBS\u201d), THE LIFE-CONTINGENT PORTION OF GUARANTEED MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL BENEFITS (\u201cGMWBS\u201d), ELECTIVE GUARANTEED MINIMUM INCOME BENEFIT (\u201cGMIB\u201d) ANNUITIZATIONS, AND THE LIFE CONTINGENT PORTION OF GMIBS THAT REQUIRE ANNUITIZATION WHEN THE ACCOUNT BALANCE GOES TO ZERO. THESE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRUED OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT IN PROPORTION TO ACTUAL AND FUTURE EXPECTED POLICY ASSESSMENTS BASED ON THE LEVEL OF GUARANTEED MINIMUM BENEFITS GENERATED USING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS OF SEPARATE ACCOUNT RETURNS. THE SCENARIOS ARE BASED ON BEST ESTIMATE ASSUMPTIONS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE USED TO AMORTIZE DAC. WHEN CURRENT ESTIMATES OF FUTURE BENEFITS EXCEED THOSE PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED OR WHEN CURRENT ESTIMATES OF FUTURE ASSESSMENTS ARE LOWER THAN THOSE PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED, LIABILITIES WILL INCREASE, RESULTING IN A CURRENT PERIOD CHARGE TO NET INCOME. THE OPPOSITE RESULT OCCURS WHEN THE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF FUTURE BENEFITS ARE LOWER THAN THOSE PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED OR WHEN CURRENT ESTIMATES OF FUTURE ASSESSMENTS EXCEED THOSE PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED. AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD, WE UPDATE THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF BUSINESS REMAINING IN-FORCE, WHICH IMPACTS EXPECTED FUTURE ASSESSMENTS AND THE PROJECTION OF ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFITS RESULTING IN A CURRENT PERIOD CHARGE OR INCREASE TO EARNINGS.  CERTAIN GUARANTEES, INCLUDING PORTIONS THEREOF, ACCOUNTED FOR AS EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, ARE RECORDED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND INCLUDED IN POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES. GUARANTEES ACCOUNTED FOR AS EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES INCLUDE GUARANTEED MINIMUM ACCUMULATION BENEFITS (\u201cGMABS\u201d), THE NON-LIFE CONTINGENT PORTION OF GMWBS AND CERTAIN NON-LIFE CONTINGENT PORTIONS OF GMIBS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF GUARANTEES ACCOUNTED FOR AS EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF PROJECTED FUTURE BENEFITS MINUS THE PRESENT VALUE OF PROJECTED FUTURE FEES. THE PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE BENEFITS AND FUTURE FEES REQUIRE CAPITAL MARKET AND ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING EXPECTATIONS CONCERNING POLICYHOLDER BEHAVIOR. A RISK-NEUTRAL VALUATION METHODOLOGY IS USED TO PROJECT THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE GUARANTEES UNDER MULTIPLE CAPITAL MARKET SCENARIOS TO DETERMINE AN ECONOMIC LIABILITY. THE REPORTED ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IS THEN DETERMINED BY TAKING THE PRESENT VALUE OF THESE RISK-FREE GENERATED CASH FLOWS USING A DISCOUNT RATE THAT INCORPORATES A SPREAD OVER THE RISK-FREE RATE TO REFLECT OUR NONPERFORMANCE RISK AND ADDING A RISK MARGIN. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE DETERMINATION OF ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, SEE NOTE  8  OF THE NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  142  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE CARRYING VALUE FOR GUARANTEES AT.

THESE NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENTS REPRESENT THE IMPACT OF INCLUDING A CREDIT SPREAD WHEN DISCOUNTING THE UNDERLYING RISK-NEUTRAL CASH FLOWS TO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES. THE NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENT DOES NOT HAVE AN ECONOMIC IMPACT ON US AS IT CANNOT BE MONETIZED GIVEN THE NATURE OF THESE POLICYHOLDER LIABILITIES. THE CHANGE IN VALUATION ARISING FROM THE NONPERFORMANCE RISK ADJUSTMENT IS NOT HEDGED.  THE CARRYING VALUES OF THESE GUARANTEES CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY DURING PERIODS OF SIZABLE AND SUSTAINED SHIFTS IN EQUITY MARKET PERFORMANCE, EQUITY VOLATILITY, INTEREST RATES OR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. CARRYING VALUES ARE ALSO IMPACTED BY OUR ASSUMPTIONS AROUND MORTALITY, SEPARATE ACCOUNT RETURNS AND POLICYHOLDER BEHAVIOR, INCLUDING LAPSE RATES.  AS DISCUSSED BELOW, WE USE A COMBINATION OF PRODUCT DESIGN, HEDGING STRATEGIES, REINSURANCE, AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TO MITIGATE THE RISKS RELATED TO THESE BENEFITS. WITHIN EACH TYPE OF GUARANTEE, THERE IS A RANGE OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS REFLECTING THE CHANGING NATURE OF THESE PRODUCTS OVER TIME. CHANGES IN PRODUCT FEATURES AND TERMS ARE IN PART DRIVEN BY CUSTOMER DEMAND BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY, REFLECT OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES OF CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATING THE GUARANTEED BENEFITS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED ASSET-LIABILITY MATCHING. WE CONTINUE TO DIVERSIFY THE CONCENTRATION OF INCOME BENEFITS IN OUR PORTFOLIO BY FOCUSING ON WITHDRAWAL BENEFITS, VARIABLE ANNUITIES WITHOUT LIVING BENEFITS AND INDEX-LINKED ANNUITIES.  THE SECTIONS BELOW PROVIDE FURTHER DETAIL BY TOTAL ACCOUNT VALUE FOR CERTAIN OF OUR MOST POPULAR GUARANTEES. TOTAL ACCOUNT VALUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS NOT REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS FROM ASSUMED BUSINESS, UNIT-LINKED INVESTMENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR PRESENTATION AS SEPARATE ACCOUNT ASSETS, AND AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN OUR GENERAL ACCOUNT. THE TOTAL ACCOUNT VALUES AND THE NET AMOUNTS AT RISK INCLUDE DIRECT AND ASSUMED BUSINESS, BUT EXCLUDE OFFSETS FROM HEDGING OR CEDED REINSURANCE, IF ANY.  143  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GMDBS  WE OFFER A RANGE OF GMDBS TO OUR CONTRACTHOLDERS.

IN TERMS OF TOTAL ACCOUNT VALUE, GMIBS ARE OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT LIVING BENEFIT GUARANTEE. OUR PRIMARY RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR OUR GMIB PRODUCTS IS OUR DERIVATIVES HEDGING PROGRAM AS DISCUSSED BELOW. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ENGAGED IN CERTAIN REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS COVERING SOME OF OUR GMIB BUSINESS. AS PART OF OUR OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH FOR LIVING BENEFIT GUARANTEES, WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE REINSURANCE MARKETS FOR THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL COVERAGE FOR OUR GMIB BUSINESS.

ADDITIONALLY, 42% OF THE $21.8 BILLION OF GMIB TOTAL ACCOUNT VALUE HAS BEEN INVESTED IN MANAGED VOLATILITY FUNDS AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  . THESE FUNDS SEEK TO MANAGE VOLATILITY BY ADJUSTING THE FUND HOLDINGS WITHIN CERTAIN GUIDELINES BASED ON CAPITAL MARKET MOVEMENTS. SUCH ACTIVITY REDUCES THE OVERALL RISK OF THE UNDERLYING FUNDS WHILE MAINTAINING THEIR GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. THESE RISK MITIGATION TECHNIQUES REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR US TO MANAGE THE FUNDS\u2019 VOLATILITY THROUGH HEDGING OR REINSURANCE.  OUR GMIB PRODUCTS TYPICALLY HAVE A WAITING PERIOD OF 10 YEARS TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR ANNUITIZATION. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , ONLY 20% OF OUR CONTRACTS WITH GMIBS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR ANNUITIZATION. THE REMAINING CONTRACTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ANNUITIZATION FOR AN AVERAGE OF FOUR YEARS.  ONCE ELIGIBLE FOR ANNUITIZATION, CONTRACTHOLDERS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO ANNUITIZE ONLY IF THEIR CONTRACTS WERE IN-THE-MONEY.

FUTURES ARE ALSO USED TO DYNAMICALLY ADJUST THE DAILY COVERAGE LEVELS AS MARKETS AND LIABILITY EXPOSURES FLUCTUATE.  WE REMAIN LIABLE FOR THE GUARANTEED BENEFITS IN THE EVENT THAT REINSURERS OR DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY. CERTAIN OF OUR REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE COLLATERALIZED AND DERIVATIVES POSITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS, BOTH OF WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE EXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTY RISK. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT HEDGING AND OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIONS PROVE INEFFECTIVE OR THAT UNANTICIPATED POLICYHOLDER BEHAVIOR OR MORTALITY, COMBINED WITH ADVERSE MARKET EVENTS, PRODUCES ECONOMIC LOSSES BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES EMPLOYED.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OVERVIEW  OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY GENERALLY. STRESSED CONDITIONS, VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTIONS IN GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS, PARTICULAR MARKETS, OR FINANCIAL ASSET CLASSES CAN HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON US, IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVE A LARGE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND OUR INSURANCE LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGING MARKET FACTORS. CHANGING CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY MAY AFFECT OUR FINANCING COSTS AND MARKET INTEREST FOR OUR DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES.

ALSO, THESE MEASURES EXCLUDE RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS UNDER GAAP AND OTHER BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE SOLD OR EXITED BY METLIFE BUT DO NOT MEET THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS CRITERIA UNDER GAAP AND ARE REFERRED TO AS DIVESTED BUSINESSES. DIVESTED BUSINESSES ALSO INCLUDES THE NET IMPACT OF TRANSACTIONS WITH EXITED BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION UNDER GAAP AND COSTS RELATING TO BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN OR WILL BE SOLD OR EXITED BY METLIFE THAT DO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA TO BE INCLUDED IN RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS UNDER GAAP.

SEE \u201c\u2014 ECONOMIC CAPITAL.\u201d ALLOCATED EQUITY EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OTHER THAN FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS.  THE ABOVE MEASURE REPRESENTS A LEVEL OF EQUITY CONSISTENT WITH THE VIEW THAT, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE DO NOT PLAN TO SELL MOST INVESTMENTS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF REALIZING GAINS OR LOSSES. ALSO, REFER TO THE UTILIZATION OF ADJUSTED EARNINGS AND OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES BASED ON ADJUSTED EARNINGS MENTIONED ABOVE.  THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS RELEVANT TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PERFORMANCE RESULTS.  \u2022  WE SOMETIMES REFER TO SALES ACTIVITY FOR VARIOUS PRODUCTS. THESE SALES STATISTICS DO NOT CORRESPOND TO REVENUES UNDER GAAP, BUT ARE USED AS RELEVANT MEASURES OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY. FURTHER, SALES STATISTICS FOR OUR LATIN AMERICA, ASIA AND EMEA SEGMENTS ARE ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS.  \u2022  ASYMMETRICAL AND NON-ECONOMIC ACCOUNTING REFERS TO: (I) THE PORTION OF NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) ON EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCLUSION OF OUR CREDIT SPREADS IN THE LIABILITY VALUATIONS, (II) HEDGING ACTIVITY THAT GENERATES NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) AND CREATES FLUCTUATIONS IN NET INCOME BECAUSE HEDGE ACCOUNTING CANNOT BE ACHIEVED AND THE ITEM BEING HEDGED DOES NOT A HAVE AN OFFSETTING GAIN OR LOSS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS, (III) INFLATION-INDEXED BENEFIT ADJUSTMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH CONTRACTS BACKED BY INFLATION-INDEXED INVESTMENTS AND AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH PERIODIC CREDITING RATE ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON THE TOTAL RETURN OF A CONTRACTUALLY REFERENCED POOL OF ASSETS AND OTHER PASS THROUGH ADJUSTMENTS, AND (IV) IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF FOREIGN DENOMINATED UNHEDGED FUNDING AGREEMENTS AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS TO THE U.S. DOLLAR AND THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN LIABILITIES FROM NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES TO FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ASYMMETRICAL AND NON-ECONOMIC ACCOUNTING FROM TOTAL GAAP RESULTS ENHANCES INVESTOR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PERFORMANCE BY DISCLOSING HOW THESE ACCOUNTING PRACTICES AFFECT REPORTED GAAP RESULTS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY USES A MEASURE OF FREE CASH FLOW TO FACILITATE AN UNDERSTANDING OF ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FOR REINVESTMENT INTO ITS BUSINESSES OR USE IN NON-MANDATORY CAPITAL ACTIONS. THE COMPANY DEFINES FREE CASH FLOW AS THE SUM OF CASH AVAILABLE AT METLIFE\u2019S HOLDING COMPANIES FROM DIVIDENDS FROM OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, EXPENSES AND OTHER NET FLOWS OF THE HOLDING COMPANIES (INCLUDING CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO SUBSIDIARIES), AND NET CONTRIBUTIONS FROM DEBT TO BE AT OR BELOW TARGET LEVERAGE RATIOS. THIS MEASURE OF FREE CASH FLOW IS PRIOR TO CAPITAL ACTIONS, SUCH AS COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASES, DEBT REDUCTION AND MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS.

THE CHANGE IN CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE TIMING OF ACHIEVEMENT OF FUTURE MILESTONES FOR OPKO RENAL AND OPKO DIAGNOSTICS.  THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITIES AT  JUNE 30, 2019  RELATE TO POTENTIAL AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO FORMER STOCKHOLDERS OF CURNA, OPKO DIAGNOSTICS AND OPKO RENAL PURSUANT TO OUR ACQUISITION AGREEMENTS IN JANUARY 2011, OCTOBER 2011 AND MARCH 2013, RESPECTIVELY.  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS  .  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS WAS  $33.0 MILLION  AND  $34.5 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  .  AMORTIZATION EXPENSE REFLECTS THE AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINED USEFUL LIVES.  OUR INDEFINITE LIVED IPR&D ASSETS WILL NOT BE AMORTIZED UNTIL THE UNDERLYING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE COMPLETED.  UPON OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL BY THE U.S. FDA, THE IPR&D ASSETS WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET AND AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER ITS ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.  ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES  .  ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE $0.7 MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND IS RELATED TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO WRITE DOWN OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS AT FINETECH DOWN TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN TESTING GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING IPR&D, FOR IMPAIRMENT ARE CONSISTENT WITH ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN THEIR ESTIMATES.  HOWEVER, IF ACTUAL RESULTS ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE THAT COULD BE MATERIAL.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN APPROPRIATE REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR  4KSCORE  TEST AND EXPERIENCE SUSTAINED DECLINES IN OPERATING RESULTS AT BIOREFERENCE, OUR ESTIMATES OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE BIOREFERENCE REPORTING UNIT MAY CHANGE.  IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT FALLS BELOW CARRYING VALUE, WE WOULD RECORD IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AT BIOREFERENCE AND SUCH IMPAIRMENT COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.  THE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT FOR HGH-CTP HAS EXCEEDED OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATES AND WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES BEYOND OUR ESTIMATES AND THE AGREED DEVELOPMENT CAP.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH PFIZER REGARDING COST SHARING FOR OVERRUNS, AS WELL AS OTHER OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT OBLIGATIONS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE EXPECTED BENEFITS OF THE PFIZER TRANSACTION. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP HGH-CTP, OR CHANGES IN PROJECTIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FORECAST OF NET CASH FLOWS, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO THE IPR&D FOR HGH-CTP.  INTEREST INCOME  .  INTEREST INCOME FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT AS OUR CASH INVESTMENT STRATEGY EMPHASIZES THE SECURITY OF THE PRINCIPAL INVESTED AND FULFILLMENT OF LIQUIDITY NEEDS.  INTEREST EXPENSE  .  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  WAS  $10.3 MILLION  AND  $5.0 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  INTEREST EXPENSE IS PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO INTEREST INCURRED ON THE 2025 NOTES, THE 2023 CONVERTIBLE NOTES, THE  49  TABLE OF CONTENTS  2033 SENIOR NOTES, AND BIOREFERENCE\u2019S OUTSTANDING DEBT UNDER ITS CREDIT FACILITY. THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST INCURRED ON THE 2025 NOTES AND 2023 CONVERTIBLE NOTES.  FAIR VALUE CHANGES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, NET  .  FAIR VALUE CHANGES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, NET FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  , WAS  $0.0 MILLION  AND  $3.6 MILLION  OF INCOME, RESPECTIVELY. DERIVATIVE INCOME FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF WARRANTS TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHARES OF NEOVASC, INC. AND XENETIC.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  .  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  , WAS  $4.9 MILLION  OF EXPENSE AND  $10.5 MILLION  OF INCOME, RESPECTIVELY.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND 2018 PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF NET UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) RECOGNIZED DURING THE PERIOD ON EQUITY SECURITIES.  INCOME TAX PROVISION  .  OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  WAS  $1.9 MILLION  AND  $1.1 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AND REFLECTS QUARTERLY RESULTS USING OUR EXPECTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , THE TAX RATE DIFFERED FROM THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF  21%  PRIMARILY DUE TO  THE RELATIVE MIX IN EARNINGS AND LOSSES IN THE U.S. VERSUS FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS AND THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN DISCRETE TAX EVENTS AND OPERATING RESULTS IN TAX JURISDICTIONS WHICH DO NOT RESULT IN A TAX BENEFIT.  LOSS FROM INVESTMENTS IN INVESTEES  .  WE HAVE MADE INVESTMENTS IN OTHER EARLY STAGE COMPANIES THAT WE PERCEIVE TO HAVE VALUABLE PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AND SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL TO CREATE VALUE FOR US AS A SHAREHOLDER OR MEMBER.  WE ACCOUNT FOR THESE INVESTMENTS UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, RESULTING IN THE RECORDING OF OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THEIR LOSSES UNTIL OUR SHARE OF THEIR LOSS EXCEEDS OUR INVESTMENT.  UNTIL THE INVESTEES\u2019 TECHNOLOGIES ARE COMMERCIALIZED, IF EVER, WE ANTICIPATE THEY WILL REPORT A NET LOSS.  LOSS FROM INVESTMENTS IN INVESTEES WAS  $2.1 MILLION  AND  $9.7 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  50  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $111.1 MILLION  .  CASH USED IN OPERATIONS OF  $102.6 MILLION  DURING 2019 PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CORPORATE OPERATIONS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES RELATED TO  RAYALDEE  .  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2019 PRIMARILY REFLECTS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF  $6.4 MILLION  .  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2025 NOTES IN FEBRUARY 2019 FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $192.5 MILLION, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REDEMPTION OF $28.8 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2033 SENIOR NOTES AND REPAYMENTS ON BIOREFERENCE\u2019S LINE OF CREDIT WITH JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. (\u201cCB\u201d).  WE HAVE NOT GENERATED SUSTAINED POSITIVE CASH FLOW SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET OUR OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSES AND OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF CASH HAS BEEN FROM THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF STOCK, THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2033 SENIOR NOTES, 2023 CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND 2025 NOTES AND CREDIT FACILITIES AVAILABLE TO US.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE ISSUED $200.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE 2025 NOTES IN AN UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC OFFERING.  THE 2025 NOTES BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE OF 4.50% PER YEAR, PAYABLE SEMIANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON FEBRUARY 15 AND AUGUST 15 OF EACH YEAR, BEGINNING ON AUGUST 15, 2019.  THE NOTES MATURE ON FEBRUARY 15, 2025, UNLESS EARLIER REPURCHASED, REDEEMED OR CONVERTED.  HOLDERS MAY CONVERT THEIR 2025 NOTES INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT THEIR OPTION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON THE BUSINESS DAY IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING NOVEMBER 15, 2024 ONLY UNDER THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES:  (1) DURING ANY CALENDAR QUARTER COMMENCING AFTER THE CALENDAR QUARTER ENDED ON MARCH 31, 2019 (AND ONLY DURING SUCH CALENDAR QUARTER), IF THE LAST REPORTED SALE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR AT LEAST 20 TRADING DAYS (WHETHER OR NOT CONSECUTIVE) DURING A PERIOD OF 30 CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAYS ENDING ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING CALENDAR QUARTER IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 130% OF THE CONVERSION PRICE ON EACH APPLICABLE TRADING DAY; (2) DURING THE FIVE BUSINESS DAY PERIOD AFTER ANY FIVE CONSECUTIVE TRADING DAY PERIOD (THE \u201cMEASUREMENT PERIOD\u201d) IN WHICH THE TRADING PRICE PER $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2025 NOTES FOR EACH TRADING DAY OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD WAS LESS THAN 98% OF THE PRODUCT OF THE LAST REPORTED SALE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE CONVERSION RATE ON EACH SUCH TRADING DAY; (3) IF WE CALL ANY OR ALL OF THE 2025 NOTES FOR REDEMPTION, AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON THE SCHEDULED TRADING DAY IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE REDEMPTION DATE; OR (4) UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF SPECIFIED CORPORATE EVENTS SET FORTH IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE 2025 NOTES.

UPON CONVERSION, WE WILL PAY OR DELIVER, AS THE CASE MAY BE, CASH, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AT OUR ELECTION.  THE INITIAL AND CURRENT CONVERSION RATE FOR THE 2025 NOTES IS 236.7424 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PER $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2025 NOTES (EQUIVALENT TO AN INITIAL CONVERSION PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $4.22 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK).  THE CONVERSION RATE FOR THE 2025 NOTES IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT IN SOME EVENTS BUT WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED FOR ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST.  ON NOVEMBER 8, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN INVESTORS PURSUANT TO WHICH WE AGREED TO SELL TO SUCH INVESTORS IN PRIVATE PLACEMENTS AN AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY 26.5 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PURCHASE PRICE OF $3.49 PER SHARE, WHICH WAS THE CLOSING BID PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE NASDAQ ON SUCH DATE, FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $92.5 MILLION.  THE INVESTORS IN THE PRIVATE PLACEMENTS INCLUDED AN AFFILIATE OF DR. PHILLIP FROST, OUR CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ($70 MILLION), AND DR. JANE HSIAO, OUR VICE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF TECHNICAL OFFICER ($2 MILLION).  WE INTEND TO USE THE PROCEEDS FROM THE PRIVATE PLACEMENTS FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  ON NOVEMBER 8, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH AN AFFILIATE OF DR. FROST, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE LENDER COMMITTED TO PROVIDE US WITH AN UNSECURED LINE OF CREDIT IN THE AMOUNT OF $60 MILLION.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED ON OR AROUND FEBRUARY 20, 2019 AND THE  $28.8 MILLION  WE BORROWED DURING 2019 WAS REPAID FROM THE PROCEEDS OF THE 2025 NOTES OFFERING.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE LINE OF CREDIT BORE INTEREST AT A RATE OF 10% PER ANNUM AND COULD BE REPAID AND REBORROWED AT ANY TIME.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDED VARIOUS CUSTOMARY REMEDIES FOR THE LENDER FOLLOWING AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, INCLUDING THE ACCELERATION OF REPAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS UNDER LINE OF CREDIT.  THE LINE OF CREDIT WOULD HAVE MATURED ON NOVEMBER 8, 2023.  ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019, APPROXIMATELY $28.8 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2033 SENIOR NOTES WERE TENDERED BY HOLDERS PURSUANT TO SUCH HOLDERS\u2019 OPTION TO REQUIRE US TO REPURCHASE THE 2033 SENIOR NOTES.

AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE TOTAL AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH CB AND OUR LINES OF CREDIT WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN CHILE AND SPAIN WAS  $92.7 MILLION  , OF WHICH  $74.0 MILLION  WAS USED AND OUTSTANDING AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  .  THE  51  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON THESE LINES OF CREDIT WAS APPROXIMATELY  4.5%  .  THESE LINES OF CREDIT ARE SHORT-TERM AND ARE USED PRIMARILY AS A SOURCE OF WORKING CAPITAL.  THE HIGHEST BALANCE AT ANY TIME DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , WAS  $112.4 MILLION  .  WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO ENTER INTO THESE LINES OF CREDIT AS NEEDED.  THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE LINES OF CREDIT OR OTHER FUNDING SOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, IN THE FUTURE.  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE REPAID  $39.0 MILLION  UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH CB BASED ON CHANGES IN OUR BORROWING BASE CALCULATION WHICH REDUCED CREDIT AVAILABLE TO US. THE REPAYMENT WAS MADE WITH CASH ON HAND. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  ,  $1.7 MILLION  ADDITIONAL FUNDS WERE AVAILABLE TO BE BORROWED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.

OPKO WILL ALSO RECEIVE TIERED, DOUBLE DIGIT ROYALTY PAYMENTS AT RATES RANGING FROM LOW DOUBLE DIGITS TO MID-TEENS ON SALES OF  RAYALDEE  WITHIN THE JT TERRITORY.  JT WILL, AT ITS SOLE COST AND EXPENSE, BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PERFORMING ALL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES NECESSARY TO OBTAIN ALL REGULATORY APPROVALS FOR  RAYALDEE  IN JAPAN AND FOR ALL COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES PERTAINING TO  RAYALDEE  IN JAPAN.  IN MAY 2016, EIRGEN, OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, PARTNERED WITH VFMCRP THROUGH A DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF  RAYALDEE  IN EUROPE, CANADA, MEXICO, AUSTRALIA, SOUTH KOREA AND CERTAIN OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  THE LICENSE TO VFMCRP POTENTIALLY COVERS ALL THERAPEUTIC AND PROPHYLACTIC USES OF THE PRODUCT IN HUMAN PATIENTS, PROVIDED THAT INITIALLY THE LICENSE IS FOR THE USE OF THE PRODUCT FOR THE TREATMENT OR PREVENTION OF SHPT RELATED TO PATIENTS WITH CKD AND VITAMIN D INSUFFICIENCY/DEFICIENCY (\u201cVFMCRP INITIAL INDICATION\u201d).  WE HAVE RECEIVED NON-REFUNDABLE AND NON-CREDITABLE PAYMENTS OF $52 MILLION AND ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $230 MILLION UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN REGULATORY AND SALES-BASED MILESTONES.  IN ADDITION, WE ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE TIERED ROYALTIES ON SALES OF THE PRODUCT AT PERCENTAGE RATES THAT RANGE FROM THE MID-TEENS TO THE MID-TWENTIES OR A MINIMUM ROYALTY, WHICHEVER IS GREATER, UPON COMMENCEMENT OF SALES OF THE PRODUCT.  AS PART OF THE ARRANGEMENT, THE COMPANIES WILL SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONDUCT OF TRIALS SPECIFIED WITHIN AN AGREED-UPON DEVELOPMENT PLAN, WITH EACH COMPANY LEADING CERTAIN ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE PLAN.  FOR THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN, THE COMPANIES HAVE AGREED TO CERTAIN COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS.  VFMCRP WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OTHER DEVELOPMENT COSTS THAT VFMCRP CONSIDERS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP THE PRODUCT FOR THE VFMCRP INITIAL INDICATION IN THE VFMCRP TERRITORY EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THE VFMCRP AGREEMENT.  EIRGEN ALSO GRANTED TO VFMCRP AN OPTION TO ACQUIRE AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO  52  TABLE OF CONTENTS  USE, IMPORT, OFFER FOR SALE, SELL, DISTRIBUTE AND COMMERCIALIZE THE PRODUCT IN THE U.S. FOR TREATMENT OF SHPT IN DIALYSIS PATIENTS WITH STAGE 5 CKD AND VITAMIN D INSUFFICIENCY (THE \u201cDIALYSIS INDICATION\u201d).  UPON EXERCISE OF THE OPTION, VFMCRP WILL REIMBURSE EIRGEN FOR ALL OF THE DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCURRED BY EIRGEN WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT FOR THE DIALYSIS INDICATION IN THE U.S.  VFMCRP WOULD ALSO PAY EIRGEN UP TO AN ADDITIONAL AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $555 MILLION UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES AND WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO PAY ROYALTIES ON SALES OF THE PRODUCT AT PERCENTAGE RATES THAT RANGE FROM THE MID-TEENS TO THE MID-TWENTIES OR A MINIMUM ROYALTY, WHICHEVER IS GREATER, UPON COMMENCEMENT OF SALES OF THE PRODUCT.  IN JANUARY 2015, WE PARTNERED WITH PFIZER THROUGH A WORLDWIDE AGREEMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR LONG-ACTING HGH-CTP FOR THE TREATMENT OF GHD IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN, AS WELL AS FOR THE TREATMENT OF GROWTH FAILURE IN CHILDREN BORN SMALL FOR GESTATIONAL AGE (\u201cSGA\u201d).  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENTS WITH PFIZER, WE RECEIVED NON-REFUNDABLE AND NON-CREDITABLE UPFRONT PAYMENTS OF $295 MILLION IN 2015 AND ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $275 MILLION UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN REGULATORY MILESTONES.  PFIZER RECEIVED THE EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO COMMERCIALIZE HGH-CTP WORLDWIDE.  IN ADDITION, WE ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE INITIAL TIERED ROYALTY PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF HGH-CTP FOR ADULT GHD WITH PERCENTAGE RATES RANGING FROM THE HIGH TEENS TO MID-TWENTIES.  UPON THE LAUNCH OF HGH-CTP FOR PEDIATRIC GHD IN CERTAIN MAJOR MARKETS, THE ROYALTIES WILL TRANSITION TO REGIONAL, TIERED GROSS PROFIT SHARING FOR BOTH HGH-CTP AND PFIZER\u2019S GENOTROPIN\u00ae.  UNDER THE AGREEMENT, WE AGREED TO LEAD THE CLINICAL ACTIVITIES AND WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR FUNDING THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FOR THE KEY INDICATIONS, WHICH INCLUDES ADULT AND PEDIATRIC GHD AND PEDIATRIC SGA.  PFIZER AGREED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS AS WELL AS ALL POST-MARKETING STUDIES.  IN ADDITION, PFIZER AGREED TO FUND THE COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES FOR ALL INDICATIONS AND LEAD THE MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES COVERED BY THE GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN.  THE AGREEMENT OBLIGATED US TO FUND DEVELOPMENT UP TO AN AGREED CAP  IN DECEMBER 2016, WE ANNOUNCED PRELIMINARY TOPLINE DATA FROM OUR PHASE 3, DOUBLE BLIND, PLACEBO CONTROLLED STUDY OF HGH-CTP IN ADULTS WITH GHD.  ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HGH-CTP AND PLACEBO ON THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT OF CHANGE IN TRUNK FAT MASS FROM BASELINE TO 26 WEEKS, AFTER UNBLINDING THE STUDY, WE IDENTIFIED AN EXCEPTIONAL VALUE OF TRUNK FAT MASS REDUCTION IN THE PLACEBO GROUP THAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED THE PRIMARY OUTCOME.  WE HAVE COMPLETED POST-HOC SENSITIVITY ANALYSES TO EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF OUTLIERS ON THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT RESULTS USING MULTIPLE STATISTICAL APPROACHES.  ANALYSES THAT EXCLUDED OUTLIERS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HGH-CTP AND PLACEBO ON THE CHANGE IN TRUNK FAT MASS.  ADDITIONAL ANALYSES THAT DID NOT EXCLUDE OUTLIERS SHOWED MIXED RESULTS.  FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE ANALYSES, OPKO AND PFIZER AGREED THAT OPKO MAY PROCEED TO DISCUSS A POSSIBLE BLA SUBMISSION WITH THE FDA.  WE BELIEVE THERE IS A PATH FOR SUBMISSION IN WHICH THE FDA MAY ASSESS THE TOTALITY OF THE DATA, INCLUDING ALL RELEVANT EFFICACY AND SAFETY DATA IN ADULT AND PEDIATRIC PATIENTS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE REGULATORY STRATEGY FOR THE ADULT INDICATION GOING FORWARD, INCLUDING THE TIMING OF A POSSIBLE SUBMISSION.  IN AUGUST 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD COMPLETED ENROLLMENT IN A GLOBAL PHASE 3 STUDY OF HGH-CTP IN GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENT CHILDREN.  THE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT FOR HGH-CTP HAS EXCEEDED OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATES AND WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES BEYOND OUR ESTIMATES AND THE AGREED DEVELOPMENT CAP.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH PFIZER REGARDING COST SHARING FOR OVERRUNS, AS WELL AS OTHER OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT OBLIGATIONS, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE EXPECTED BENEFITS OF THE PFIZER TRANSACTION AND OUR OVERALL FINANCIAL CONDITION.  IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP HGH- CTP AND/OR PFIZER INC. WERE TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT OR NOT SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZE HGH-CTP FOR ANY REASON, OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  WE ARE CONSTRUCTING A RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING CENTER IN WATERFORD, IRELAND, FOR WHICH WE WILL INCUR BETWEEN $40 MILLION AND $50 MILLION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND VALIDATION OF THE FACILITY.  CONSTRUCTION OF THE FACILITY BEGAN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2016 WITH EXPECTED COMPLETION IN 2019.  CURRENTLY, WE PLAN TO FUND THE PROJECT FROM CASH ON HAND OR FROM THIRD PARTY FUNDING SOURCES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO US. THROUGH  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE CUMULATIVE EXPENDITURES WE INCURRED TO DATE ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE FACILITY WAS APPROXIMATELY $39.9 MILLION.  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS OF CURNA, OPKO DIAGNOSTICS AND OPKO RENAL, WE AGREED TO PAY FUTURE CONSIDERATION TO THE SELLERS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN EVENTS, INCLUDING UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $19.1 MILLION  IN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO THE FORMER STOCKHOLDERS OF OPKO DIAGNOSTICS UPON AND SUBJECT TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES; AND UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $125.0 MILLION  IN EITHER SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK OR CASH, AT OUR OPTION SUBJECT TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES, TO THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF OPKO RENAL.  IN NOVEMBER 2015, BIOREFERENCE AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. (\u201cCB\u201d), AS LENDER AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AS AMENDED (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d).  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR A $100.0 MILLION SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND INCLUDES A $20.0 MILLION SUB-FACILITY FOR SWINGLINE LOANS AND A $20.0 MILLION SUB-FACILITY FOR THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.  BIOREFERENCE MAY INCREASE THE CREDIT FACILITY TO UP TO $275.0 MILLION ON A SECURED BASIS, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF SPECIFIED CONDITIONS.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT MATURES ON NOVEMBER 5, 2020 AND IS  53  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GUARANTEED BY ALL OF BIOREFERENCE\u2019S DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS ALSO SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ASSETS OF BIOREFERENCE AND ITS DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES, AS WELL AS A NON-RECOURSE PLEDGE BY US OF OUR EQUITY INTEREST IN BIOREFERENCE.  AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS BASED ON A BORROWING BASE COMPRISED OF ELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES OF BIOREFERENCE AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AS SPECIFIED THEREIN.  WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, INCLUDING EXPENSES RELATED TO THE HIRING OF PERSONNEL AND ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS.  WE EXPECT THAT SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WILL ALSO INCREASE AS WE EXPAND OUR SALES, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF AND ADD INFRASTRUCTURE.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON HAND AT  JUNE 30, 2019  ,  THE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE TO BE BORROWED UNDER OUR LINES OF CREDIT AND THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2025 NOTES IN FEBRUARY 2019 ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR OPERATIONS AND DEBT SERVICE BEYOND THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  WE BASED THIS ESTIMATE ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY PROVE TO BE WRONG OR ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO USE OUR AVAILABLE CASH RESOURCES SOONER THAN WE CURRENTLY EXPECT.  IF WE ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL ASSETS OR COMPANIES, ACCELERATE OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OR INITIATE ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS, WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDS.  OUR FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH PFIZER, THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF  RAYALDEE  , BIOREFERENCE\u2019S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS, THE CONTINUED PROGRESS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES, THE TIMING AND OUTCOME OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND REGULATORY APPROVALS, THE COSTS INVOLVED IN PREPARING, FILING, PROSECUTING, MAINTAINING, DEFENDING, AND ENFORCING PATENT CLAIMS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, THE STATUS OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING, OUR SUCCESS IN DEVELOPING MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES AND RESULTS OF GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, PAYOR CLAIMS, AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT MAY ARISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION CLASS ACTION AND DERIVATIVE LITIGATION TO WHICH WE ARE SUBJECT, AND OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SUCH CLAIMS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\"FASB\") ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\"ASU\") NO. 2016-02, \u201cLEASES (TOPIC 842),\u201d WHICH REQUIRES ORGANIZATIONS THAT LEASE ASSETS WITH LEASE TERMS OF MORE THAN 12 MONTHS TO RECOGNIZE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS CREATED BY THOSE LEASES ON THEIR BALANCE SHEETS.  ASU 2016-02, AS AMENDED AND CODIFIED UNDER TOPIC 842, REQUIRES NEW QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES TO HELP INVESTORS AND OTHER FINANCIAL STATEMENT USERS BETTER UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNT, TIMING, AND UNCERTAINTY OF CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM LEASES.  AS REQUIRED, WE ADOPTED TOPIC 842 ON JANUARY 1, 2019 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH FOR ALL LEASE ARRANGEMENTS AT THE BEGINNING OR THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION. RESULTS FOR REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2019 ARE PRESENTED UNDER TOPIC 842, WHILE PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS WERE NOT ADJUSTED AND CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE OUR HISTORIC ACCOUNTING UNDER ASC 840.  FOR LEASES THAT COMMENCED BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF TOPIC 842, WE ELECTED THE PERMITTED PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS TO NOT REASSESS THE FOLLOWING: (I) WHETHER ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING CONTRACTS CONTAIN LEASES (II) THE LEASE CLASSIFICATION FOR ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING LEASES AND (III) INITIAL DIRECT COSTS FOR ANY EXISTING LEASES. WE ALSO ELECTED THE POLICY OF NOT RECORDING LEASES ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WHEN THE LEASES HAVE A TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS AND WE ELECTED NOT TO SEPARATE NONLEASE COMPONENTS FROM LEASE COMPONENTS AND INSTEAD ACCOUNT FOR EACH SEPARATE LEASE COMPONENT AND THE NONLEASE COMPONENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT LEASE COMPONENT AS A SINGLE LEASE COMPONENT.  THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842 RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY  $33.7 MILLION  AND OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-TO-USE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY  $33.3 MILLION  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OPERATING LEASES FOR OUR DIAGNOSTIC FACILITIES, BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. THERE WAS NO CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO BEGINNING ACCUMULATED DEFICIT ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE ACCOUNTING FOR OUR FINANCE LEASES REMAINS SUBSTANTIALLY UNCHANGED, AS FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES AND THEIR CORRESPONDING RIGHT-TO-USE ASSETS WERE ALREADY RECORDED ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET UNDER THE PREVIOUS GUIDANCE. THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842 DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. REFER TO NOTE 15 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY TOPIC 842.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-02, \"INCOME STATEMENT-REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220).\" THIS STANDARD PROVIDES AN OPTION TO RECLASSIFY STRANDED TAX EFFECTS WITHIN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS TO RETAINED EARNINGS DUE TO THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE CHANGE IN THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017. THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. WE ADOPTED THIS STANDARD EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019 WITH THE ELECTION NOT TO RECLASSIFY IMMATERIAL AMOUNTS OF STRANDED TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS TO RETAINED EARNINGS.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-07, \u201cCOMPENSATION - STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718),\u201d WHICH EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF TOPIC 718 TO INCLUDE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS FOR ACQUIRING GOODS AND SERVICES FROM NON-EMPLOYEES.  THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2018-07 ON JANUARY 1, 2019, DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  PENDING ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-13, \u201cFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326): MEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,\u201d WHICH AMENDS THE IMPAIRMENT MODEL BY REQUIRING ENTITIES TO USE A FORWARD-LOOKING APPROACH BASED ON EXPECTED LOSSES RATHER THAN INCURRED LOSSES TO ESTIMATE CREDIT LOSSES ON CERTAIN TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING TRADE RECEIVABLES. THIS MAY RESULT IN THE EARLIER RECOGNITION OF ALLOWANCES FOR LOSSES. THE ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR PUBLIC ENTITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  55  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Opko Health, Inc.", "CIK": 944809, "Date": "2019-08-07T00:00:00", "Ticker": "OPK", "Name": "Opko Health Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 2834.0, "Business": "FL", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 752402409.0, "key": "20190807OPK", "labelr1": -2.0512820512820533, "labelr2": -6.2827225130889985, "labelr3": 2.234636871508381, "labelr4": 1.6393442622950831, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.55124635, "prof1": 0.44875363, "return1&2": 1.0846288092361391, "return1&2&3": 1.060391293945946, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0430078301107664, "return2": 1.0628272251308901, "return1": 1.0205128205128204, "return3": 0.9776536312849162, "return4": 0.9836065573770492, "1_day_return": -2.051282051282055, "cumulative_return1": 4.0938092863308135, "cumulative_return1&2": 11.021896292997415, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 141.09481996337206, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 405.502638528706, "indexx": 1857, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.02185590568366, "cumreturn1b": 0.9772694564213098, "cumreturndow": 0.994762262933215, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9922797567204602}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1992, "level_0": 2045, "index": 32278, "text": "ITEM 2.

USL\u2019S  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS  FACTORS.  USL HAS BASED THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO IT ON THE DATE OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q,  AND USL ASSUMES NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH USL UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION TO REVISE OR  UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE, INVESTORS ARE ADVISED  TO CONSULT ANY ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES THAT USL MAY MAKE DIRECTLY TO THEM OR THROUGH REPORTS THAT USL FILES IN THE FUTURE WITH THE  U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \u201cSEC\u201d), INCLUDING ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM  10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K.  INTRODUCTION  USL, A DELAWARE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, IS  A COMMODITY POOL THAT ISSUES SHARES THAT MAY BE PURCHASED AND SOLD ON THE NYSE ARCA, INC. (THE \u201cNYSE ARCA\u201d). THE INVESTMENT  OBJECTIVE OF USL IS FOR THE DAILY CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS OF ITS SHARES\u2019 PER SHARE NET ASSET VALUE (\u201cNAV\u201d)  TO REFLECT THE DAILY CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS OF THE SPOT PRICE OF LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL DELIVERED TO CUSHING, OKLAHOMA, AS  MEASURED BY THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE OF THE PRICES OF 12 FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL TRADED ON THE NEW  YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE (THE \u201cNYMEX\u201d) THAT IS THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT TO EXPIRE AND THE CONTRACTS FOR THE FOLLOWING  11 MONTHS FOR A TOTAL OF 12 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS\u2019 CONTRACTS, EXCEPT WHEN THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT IS WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF EXPIRATION,  IN WHICH CASE IT WILL BE MEASURED BY THE FUTURES CONTRACT THAT IS THE NEXT MONTH CONTRACT TO EXPIRE AND THE CONTRACTS FOR THE FOLLOWING  11 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS (THE \u201cBENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS\u201d), PLUS INTEREST EARNED ON USL\u2019S COLLATERAL HOLDINGS,  LESS USL\u2019S EXPENSES. \u201cNEAR MONTH CONTRACT\u201d MEANS THE NEXT CONTRACT TRADED ON THE NYMEX DUE TO EXPIRE. \u201cNEXT  MONTH CONTRACT\u201d MEANS THE FIRST CONTRACT TRADED ON THE NYMEX DUE TO EXPIRE AFTER THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT. WHEN CALCULATING  THE DAILY MOVEMENT OF THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE 12 CONTRACTS, EACH CONTRACT MONTH WILL BE EQUALLY WEIGHTED.  USL\u2019S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE IS  NOT  FOR ITS NAV OR MARKET PRICE OF SHARES TO EQUAL, IN DOLLAR TERMS, THE SPOT PRICE OF LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL OR ANY PARTICULAR  FUTURES CONTRACT BASED ON LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL,  NOR  IS USL\u2019S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE FOR THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN ITS  NAV TO REFLECT THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE OF THE PRICE OF ANY PARTICULAR FUTURES CONTRACT AS MEASURED OVER A TIME PERIOD  GREATER  THAN ONE DAY  . THE GENERAL PARTNER OF USL, UNITED STATES COMMODITY FUNDS LLC (\u201cUSCF\u201d), BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT PRACTICAL  TO MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO TO ACHIEVE SUCH AN INVESTMENT GOAL WHEN INVESTING IN OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS (AS DEFINED BELOW) AND OTHER  OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS (AS DEFINED BELOW).  16  USL INVESTS PRIMARILY IN FUTURES CONTRACTS  FOR LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL, OTHER TYPES OF CRUDE OIL, HEATING OIL, GASOLINE, NATURAL GAS AND OTHER PETROLEUM-BASED FUELS THAT ARE  TRADED ON THE NYMEX, ICE FUTURES OR OTHER U.S. AND FOREIGN EXCHANGES (COLLECTIVELY, \u201cOIL FUTURES CONTRACTS\u201d) AND TO  A LESSER EXTENT, IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR IN VIEW OF MARKET CONDITIONS, OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS  SUCH AS CASH-SETTLED OPTIONS ON OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS, FORWARD CONTRACTS FOR OIL, CLEARED SWAP CONTRACTS AND OVER-THE-COUNTER (\u201cOTC\u201d)  SWAPS THAT ARE BASED ON THE PRICE OF OIL, OTHER PETROLEUM-BASED FUELS, OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AND INDICES BASED ON THE FOREGOING  (COLLECTIVELY, \u201cOTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS\u201d). FOR CONVENIENCE AND UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED, OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS  AND OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS COLLECTIVELY ARE REFERRED TO AS \u201cOIL INTERESTS\u201d IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM  10-Q.  USCF BELIEVES THAT MARKET ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES  WILL CAUSE DAILY CHANGES IN USL\u2019S SHARE PRICE ON THE NYSE ARCA ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS TO CLOSELY TRACK DAILY CHANGES IN USL\u2019S  PER SHARE NAV ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS. USCF FURTHER BELIEVES THAT DAILY CHANGES IN PRICES OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS  HAVE HISTORICALLY CLOSELY TRACKED THE DAILY CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES OF LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL. USCF BELIEVES THAT THE NET EFFECT  OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS WILL BE THAT THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF USL\u2019S SHARES ON THE NYSE ARCA ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS  WILL CLOSELY TRACK, THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE SPOT PRICE OF A BARREL OF LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS, PLUS INTEREST  EARNED ON USL\u2019S COLLATERAL HOLDINGS, LESS USL\u2019S EXPENSES.  USL SEEKS TO ACHIEVE ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE  BY INVESTING SO THAT THE AVERAGE DAILY PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN USL\u2019S NAV FOR ANY PERIOD OF 30 SUCCESSIVE VALUATION DAYS WILL  BE WITHIN PLUS/MINUS TEN PERCENT (10%) OF THE AVERAGE DAILY PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACT  OVER THE SAME PERIOD.  REGULATORY DISCLOSURE  ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS, POSITION LIMITS  AND PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS  . DESIGNATED CONTRACT MARKETS (\u201cDCMS\u201d), SUCH AS THE NYMEX AND ICE FUTURES, HAVE ESTABLISHED  ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS AND POSITION LIMITS ON THE MAXIMUM NET LONG OR NET SHORT FUTURES CONTRACTS IN COMMODITY INTERESTS THAT ANY  PERSON OR GROUP OF PERSONS UNDER COMMON TRADING CONTROL (OTHER THAN AS A HEDGE, WHICH AN INVESTMENT BY USL IS NOT) MAY HOLD, OWN  OR CONTROL. THESE LEVELS AND POSITION LIMITS APPLY TO THE FUTURES CONTRACTS THAT USL INVESTS IN TO MEET ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE.  IN ADDITION TO ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS AND POSITION LIMITS, THE NYMEX AND ICE FUTURES ALSO SET DAILY PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS ON  FUTURES CONTRACTS. THE DAILY PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMIT ESTABLISHES THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT THE PRICE OF A FUTURES CONTRACT MAY VARY  EITHER UP OR DOWN FROM THE PREVIOUS DAY\u2019S SETTLEMENT PRICE. ONCE THE DAILY PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMIT HAS BEEN REACHED IN A  PARTICULAR FUTURES CONTRACT, NO TRADES MAY BE MADE AT A PRICE BEYOND THAT LIMIT.  THE ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS FOR THE BENCHMARK  OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OTHER OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ON U.S.-BASED FUTURES EXCHANGES, SUCH AS THE NYMEX, ARE NOT A FIXED  CEILING, BUT RATHER A THRESHOLD ABOVE WHICH THE NYMEX MAY EXERCISE GREATER SCRUTINY AND CONTROL OVER AN INVESTOR\u2019S POSITIONS.  THE CURRENT ACCOUNTABILITY LEVEL FOR INVESTMENTS FOR ANY ONE MONTH IN THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS IS 10,000 CONTRACTS.  IN ADDITION, THE NYMEX IMPOSES AN ACCOUNTABILITY LEVEL FOR ALL MONTHS OF 20,000 NET FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL.  IN ADDITION, ICE FUTURES MAINTAINS ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS, POSITION LIMITS AND MONITORING AUTHORITY FOR ITS FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR  LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL. IF USL AND THE RELATED PUBLIC FUNDS EXCEED THESE ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS FOR INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURES CONTRACTS  FOR LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL, THE NYMEX AND ICE FUTURES WILL MONITOR SUCH EXPOSURE AND MAY ASK FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THEIR ACTIVITIES  INCLUDING THE TOTAL SIZE OF ALL POSITIONS, INVESTMENT AND TRADING STRATEGY, AND THE EXTENT OF LIQUIDITY RESOURCES OF USL AND THE  RELATED PUBLIC FUNDS. IF DEEMED NECESSARY BY THE NYMEX AND/OR ICE FUTURES, USL COULD BE ORDERED TO REDUCE ITS NET FUTURES CONTRACTS  BACK TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY LEVEL. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, USL HELD 949 FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL TRADED ON THE  NYMEX AND DID NOT HOLD ANY OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE ICE FUTURES. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 USL DID NOT  EXCEED THE ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS IMPOSED BY THE NYMEX OR ICE FUTURES, HOWEVER, THE AGGREGATED TOTAL OF CERTAIN OF THE RELATED PUBLIC  FUNDS DID EXCEED THE ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS. NO ACTION WAS TAKEN BY NYMEX AND USL DID NOT REDUCE THE NUMBER OF OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS  HELD AS A RESULT.  17  POSITION LIMITS DIFFER FROM ACCOUNTABILITY  LEVELS IN THAT THEY REPRESENT FIXED LIMITS ON THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF FUTURES CONTRACTS THAT ANY PERSON MAY HOLD AND CANNOT ALLOW  SUCH LIMITS TO BE EXCEEDED WITHOUT EXPRESS CFTC AUTHORITY TO DO SO. IN ADDITION TO ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS AND POSITION LIMITS THAT  MAY APPLY AT ANY TIME, THE NYMEX AND ICE FUTURES IMPOSE POSITION LIMITS ON CONTRACTS HELD IN THE LAST FEW DAYS OF TRADING IN THE  NEAR MONTH CONTRACT TO EXPIRE. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT USL WILL RUN UP AGAINST SUCH POSITION LIMITS BECAUSE USL\u2019S INVESTMENT  STRATEGY IS TO CLOSE OUT ITS POSITIONS AND \u201cROLL\u201d FROM THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT TO EXPIRE AND THE ELEVEN FOLLOWING MONTHS  TO THE NEXT MONTH CONTRACT TO EXPIRE AND THE ELEVEN FOLLOWING MONTHS DURING A ONE DAY EACH MONTH. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE  30, 2019, USL DID NOT EXCEED POSITION LIMITS IMPOSED BY THE NYMEX AND ICE FUTURES.  THE REGULATION OF COMMODITY INTEREST TRADING  IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES IS AN EVOLVING AREA OF THE LAW. THE VARIOUS STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS SUMMARY ARE SUBJECT  TO MODIFICATION BY LEGISLATIVE ACTION AND CHANGES IN THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SEC, FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY  (\u201cFINRA\u201d), CFTC, NFA, THE FUTURES EXCHANGES, CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER REGULATORY BODIES.  FUTURES CONTRACTS AND POSITION LIMITS  THE CFTC IS GENERALLY PROHIBITED BY STATUTE  FROM REGULATING TRADING ON NON-U.S. FUTURES EXCHANGES AND MARKETS. THE CFTC, HOWEVER, HAS ADOPTED REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE MARKETING  OF NON-U.S. FUTURES CONTRACTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE REGULATIONS PERMIT CERTAIN CONTRACTS ON NON-U.S. EXCHANGES TO BE OFFERED  AND SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE CFTC HAS PROPOSED TO ADOPT LIMITS ON  SPECULATIVE POSITIONS IN 25 PHYSICAL COMMODITY FUTURES AND OPTION CONTRACTS AS WELL AS SWAPS THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY EQUIVALENT TO  SUCH CONTRACTS IN THE AGRICULTURE, ENERGY AND METALS MARKETS (THE \u201cPOSITION LIMIT RULES\u201d). THE POSITION LIMIT RULES  WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS: IDENTIFY WHICH CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO SPECULATIVE POSITION LIMITS; SET THRESHOLDS THAT RESTRICT THE  SIZE OF SPECULATIVE POSITIONS THAT A PERSON MAY HOLD IN THE SPOT MONTH, OTHER INDIVIDUAL MONTHS, AND ALL MONTHS COMBINED; CREATE  AN EXEMPTION FOR POSITIONS THAT CONSTITUTE BONA FIDE HEDGING TRANSACTIONS; IMPOSE RESPONSIBILITIES ON DCMS AND SWAP EXECUTION FACILITIES  (\u201cSEFS\u201d) TO ESTABLISH POSITION LIMITS OR, IN SOME CASES, POSITION ACCOUNTABILITY RULES; AND APPLY TO BOTH FUTURES AND  SWAPS ACROSS FOUR RELEVANT VENUES: OTC, DCMS, SEFS AS WELL AS CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATED PLATFORMS. THE CFTC\u2019S FIRST ATTEMPT  AT FINALIZING THE POSITION LIMIT RULES, IN 2011, WAS SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS IN 2012 AND, SINCE THEN, THE  CFTC HAS RE-PROPOSED THEM AND SOLICITED COMMENTS FROM MARKET PARTICIPANTS MULTIPLE TIMES. AT THIS TIME, IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THE POSITION  LIMIT RULES MAY AFFECT USL, BUT THE EFFECT MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL AND ADVERSE. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, THE POSITION LIMIT RULES MAY NEGATIVELY  IMPACT THE ABILITY OF USL TO MEET ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES THROUGH LIMITS THAT MAY INHIBIT USCF\u2019S ABILITY TO SELL ADDITIONAL  CREATION BASKETS OF USL.  UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE POSITION LIMIT RULES  ARE ADOPTED, THE REGULATORY ARCHITECTURE IN EFFECT PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THE POSITION LIMIT RULES WILL GOVERN TRANSACTIONS IN  COMMODITIES AND RELATED DERIVATIVES. UNDER THAT SYSTEM, THE CFTC ENFORCES FEDERAL LIMITS ON SPECULATION IN NINE AGRICULTURAL  PRODUCTS (E.G., CORN, WHEAT AND SOY), WHILE FUTURES EXCHANGES ESTABLISH AND ENFORCE POSITION LIMITS AND ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS FOR  OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND CERTAIN ENERGY PRODUCTS (E.G., OIL AND NATURAL GAS). AS A RESULT, USL MAY BE LIMITED  WITH RESPECT TO THE SIZE OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN ANY COMMODITIES SUBJECT TO THESE LIMITS.  UNDER EXISTING AND RECENTLY ADOPTED CFTC  REGULATIONS, FOR THE PURPOSE OF POSITION LIMITS, A MARKET PARTICIPANT IS GENERALLY REQUIRED, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN NARROW EXCEPTIONS,  TO AGGREGATE ALL POSITIONS FOR WHICH THAT PARTICIPANT CONTROLS THE TRADING DECISIONS WITH ALL POSITIONS FOR WHICH THAT PARTICIPANT  HAS A 10 PERCENT OR GREATER OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN AN ACCOUNT OR POSITION, AS WELL AS THE POSITIONS OF TWO OR MORE PERSONS ACTING  PURSUANT TO AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED AGREEMENT OR UNDERSTANDING WITH THAT PARTICIPANT (THE \u201cAGGREGATION RULES\u201d). THE AGGREGATION  RULES WILL ALSO APPLY WITH RESPECT TO THE POSITION LIMIT RULES IF AND WHEN SUCH POSITION LIMIT RULES ARE ADOPTED.  18  OTC SWAPS  IN OCTOBER 2015, THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER  OF THE CURRENCY, THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, THE FDIC, THE FARM CREDIT ADMINISTRATION, AND THE FEDERAL  HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY (EACH AN \u201cAGENCY\u201d AND, COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cAGENCIES\u201d) JOINTLY ADOPTED FINAL RULES  TO ESTABLISH MINIMUM MARGIN AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR REGISTERED SWAP DEALERS, MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS, SECURITY-BASED SWAP  DEALERS, AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS (\u201cSWAP ENTITIES\u201d) THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF ONE OF  THE AGENCIES (SUCH ENTITIES, \u201cCOVERED SWAP ENTITIES\u201d, AND THE JOINT FINAL RULES, THE \u201cFINAL MARGIN RULES\u201d).  THE FINAL MARGIN RULES WILL SUBJECT NON-CLEARED  SWAPS AND NON-CLEARED SECURITY-BASED SWAPS BETWEEN COVERED SWAP ENTITIES AND SWAP ENTITIES, AND BETWEEN COVERED SWAP ENTITIES AND  FINANCIAL END USERS THAT HAVE MATERIAL SWAPS EXPOSURE (I.E., AN AVERAGE DAILY AGGREGATE NOTIONAL OF $8 BILLION OR MORE IN NON-CLEARED  SWAPS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINAL MARGIN RULES), TO A MANDATORY TWO-WAY MINIMUM INITIAL MARGIN REQUIREMENT. THE MINIMUM  AMOUNT OF THE INITIAL MARGIN REQUIRED TO BE POSTED OR COLLECTED WOULD BE EITHER THE AMOUNT CALCULATED BY THE COVERED SWAP ENTITY  USING A STANDARDIZED SCHEDULE SET FORTH AS AN APPENDIX TO THE FINAL MARGIN RULES, WHICH PROVIDES THE GROSS INITIAL MARGIN (AS A  PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NOTIONAL EXPOSURE) FOR CERTAIN ASSET CLASSES, OR AN INTERNAL MARGIN MODEL OF THE COVERED SWAP ENTITY CONFORMING  TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL MARGIN RULES THAT IS APPROVED BY THE AGENCY HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTICULAR COVERED SWAP  ENTITY. THE FINAL MARGIN RULES SPECIFY THE TYPES OF COLLATERAL THAT MAY BE POSTED OR COLLECTED AS INITIAL MARGIN FOR NON-CLEARED  SWAPS AND NON-CLEARED SECURITY-BASED SWAPS WITH FINANCIAL END USERS (GENERALLY CASH, CERTAIN GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE  SECURITIES, CERTAIN LIQUID DEBT, CERTAIN EQUITY SECURITIES, CERTAIN ELIGIBLE PUBLICLY TRADED DEBT, AND GOLD); AND SETS FORTH HAIRCUTS  FOR CERTAIN COLLATERAL ASSET CLASSES.  THE FINAL MARGIN RULES REQUIRE MINIMUM  VARIATION MARGIN TO BE EXCHANGED DAILY FOR NON-CLEARED SWAPS AND NON-CLEARED SECURITY-BASED SWAPS BETWEEN COVERED SWAP ENTITIES  AND SWAP ENTITIES AND BETWEEN COVERED SWAP ENTITIES AND ALL FINANCIAL END-USERS (WITHOUT REGARD TO THE SWAPS EXPOSURE OF THE PARTICULAR  FINANCIAL END-USER). THE MINIMUM VARIATION MARGIN AMOUNT IS THE DAILY MARK-TO-MARKET CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE SWAP TO THE COVERED  SWAP ENTITY, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT VARIATION MARGIN PREVIOUSLY POSTED OR COLLECTED. FOR NON-CLEARED SWAPS AND SECURITY-BASED SWAPS  BETWEEN COVERED SWAP ENTITIES AND FINANCIAL END-USERS, VARIATION MARGIN MAY BE POSTED OR COLLECTED IN CASH OR NON-CASH COLLATERAL  THAT IS CONSIDERED ELIGIBLE FOR INITIAL MARGIN PURPOSES. VARIATION MARGIN IS NOT SUBJECT TO SEGREGATION WITH AN INDEPENDENT, THIRD-PARTY  CUSTODIAN, AND MAY, IF PERMITTED BY CONTRACT, BE REHYPOTHECATED.  THE INITIAL MARGIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE  FINAL MARGIN RULES ARE BEING PHASED IN OVER TIME, AND THE VARIATION MARGIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL MARGIN RULES ARE CURRENTLY  IN EFFECT. THE FUND IS NOT A COVERED SWAP ENTITY UNDER THE FINAL MARGIN RULES, BUT IT IS A FINANCIAL END-USER. ACCORDINGLY, THE  FUND IS CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO THE VARIATION MARGIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL MARGIN RULES. HOWEVER, THE FUND DOES NOT HAVE  MATERIAL SWAPS EXPOSURE AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE FUND WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE INITIAL MARGIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL MARGIN RULES.  THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER  PROTECTION ACT (THE \u201cDODD-FRANK ACT\u201d) REQUIRED THE CFTC AND THE SEC TO ADOPT THEIR OWN MARGIN RULES TO APPLY TO  A LIMITED NUMBER OF REGISTERED SWAP DEALERS, SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS, MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS, AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP  PARTICIPANTS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF ONE OF THE AGENCIES. ON DECEMBER 16, 2015 THE CFTC FINALIZED ITS MARGIN  RULES, WHICH ARE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THE FINAL MARGIN RULES AND HAVE THE SAME IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE. THE SEC ADOPTED MARGIN  RULES FOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS ON JUNE 21, 2019. THE SEC\u2019S MARGIN RULES  ARE GENERALLY ALIGNED WITH THE FINAL MARGIN RULES AND THE CFTC\u2019S MARGIN RULES, BUT THEY DIFFER IN A FEW KEY RESPECTS RELATING  TO TIMING FOR COMPLIANCE AND THE MANNER IN WHICH INITIAL MARGIN MUST BE SEGREGATED. USL DOES NOT CURRENTLY ENGAGE IN SECURITY-BASED  SWAP TRANSACTIONS AND, THEREFORE, THE SEC\u2019S MARGIN RULES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO APPLY TO USL.  MANDATORY TRADING AND CLEARING OF SWAPS  CFTC REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT CERTAIN SWAP  TRANSACTIONS BE EXECUTED ON ORGANIZED EXCHANGES OR \u201cSWAP EXECUTION FACILITIES\u201d AND CLEARED THROUGH REGULATED CLEARING  ORGANIZATIONS (\u201cDERIVATIVE CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS\u201d (\u201cDCOS\u201d)), IF THE CFTC MANDATES THE CENTRAL CLEARING  OF A PARTICULAR CLASS OF SWAP AND SUCH SWAP IS \u201cMADE AVAILABLE TO TRADE\u201d ON A SWAP EXECUTION FACILITY. CURRENTLY, SWAP  DEALERS, MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS, COMMODITY POOLS, CERTAIN PRIVATE FUNDS AND ENTITIES PREDOMINANTLY ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES THAT  ARE FINANCIAL IN NATURE ARE REQUIRED TO EXECUTE ON A SWAP EXECUTION FACILITY, AND CLEAR, CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND INDEX-BASED  CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS. AS A RESULT, IF USL ENTERS INTO AN INTEREST RATE OR INDEX-BASED CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP THAT IS SUBJECT  TO THESE REQUIREMENTS, SUCH SWAP WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE EXECUTED ON A SWAP EXECUTION FACILITY AND CENTRALLY CLEARED. MANDATORY  CLEARING AND \u201cMADE AVAILABLE TO TRADE\u201d DETERMINATIONS WITH RESPECT TO ADDITIONAL TYPES OF SWAPS ARE EXPECTED IN THE  FUTURE, AND, WHEN FINALIZED, COULD REQUIRE USL TO ELECTRONICALLY EXECUTE AND CENTRALLY CLEAR CERTAIN OTC INSTRUMENTS PRESENTLY  ENTERED INTO AND SETTLED ON A BI-LATERAL BASIS. IF A SWAP IS REQUIRED TO BE CLEARED, INITIAL AND VARIATION MARGIN REQUIREMENTS  ARE SET BY THE RELEVANT CLEARING ORGANIZATION, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES. ADDITIONAL MARGIN MAY  BE REQUIRED AND HELD BY USL'S FCM.  OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR SWAPS  IN ADDITION TO THE MARGIN REQUIREMENTS  DESCRIBED ABOVE, SWAPS THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE CLEARED AND EXECUTED ON A SEF BUT THAT ARE EXECUTED BILATERALLY ARE ALSO SUBJECT  TO VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS PURSUANT TO CFTC REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REPORTING AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS AND,  DEPENDING ON THE STATUS OF THE COUNTERPARTIES, TRADING DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION REQUIREMENTS.  19  DERIVATIVES REGULATIONS IN NON-U.S.  JURISDICTIONS  IN ADDITION TO U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS, USL  MAY BE SUBJECT TO NON-U.S. DERIVATIVES LAWS AND REGULATIONS IF IT ENGAGES IN FUTURES AND/OR SWAP TRANSACTIONS WITH NON-U.S. PERSONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, USL MAY BE IMPACTED BY EUROPEAN LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO THE EXTENT THAT IT ENGAGES IN FUTURES TRANSACTIONS ON  EUROPEAN EXCHANGES OR DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS WITH EUROPEAN ENTITIES. OTHER JURISDICTIONS IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO FUTURES  AND DERIVATIVES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IMPOSED BY THE U.S., INCLUDING POSITION LIMITS, MARGIN, CLEARING AND TRADE EXECUTION  REQUIREMENTS.  MONEY MARKET FUNDS  THE SEC ADOPTED AMENDMENTS TO RULE 2A-7  UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, AS AMENDED (\"1940 ACT\") WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN 2016, TO REFORM MONEY  MARKET FUNDS (\u201cMMFS\u201d). WHILE THE RULE APPLIES ONLY TO MMFS, IT MAY INDIRECTLY AFFECT INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS SUCH AS  USL. A PORTION OF USL'S ASSETS THAT ARE NOT USED FOR MARGIN OR COLLATERAL IN THE FUTURES CONTRACTS CURRENTLY ARE INVESTED  IN GOVERNMENT MMFS. USL DOES NOT HOLD ANY NON-GOVERNMENT MMFS AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE INVESTING IN ANY NON-GOVERNMENT MMFS.  HOWEVER, IF USL INVESTS IN OTHER TYPES OF MMFS BESIDES GOVERNMENT MMFS IN THE FUTURE, USL COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INVESTING  IN AN MMF THAT DOES NOT MAINTAIN A STABLE $1.00 NAV OR THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPOSE REDEMPTION FEES AND GATES (TEMPORARY  SUSPENSION OF REDEMPTIONS).  ALTHOUGH SUCH GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUNDS  SEEK TO PRESERVE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT AT $1.00 PER SHARE, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO AND USL  MAY LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND. AN INVESTMENT IN A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND IS NOT INSURED OR  GUARANTEED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE FDIC, OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY. THE SHARE  PRICE OF A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND CAN FALL BELOW THE $1.00 SHARE PRICE. USL CANNOT RELY ON OR EXPECT A GOVERNMENT MONEY  MARKET FUND\u2019S ADVISER OR ITS AFFILIATES TO ENTER INTO SUPPORT AGREEMENTS OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS TO MAINTAIN THE GOVERNMENT  MONEY MARKET FUND\u2019S $1.00 SHARE PRICE. THE CREDIT QUALITY OF A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND\u2019S HOLDINGS CAN CHANGE RAPIDLY  IN CERTAIN MARKETS, AND THE DEFAULT OF A SINGLE HOLDING COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND\u2019S  SHARE PRICE. DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, THE MARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES HELD BY A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND MAY VARY.  A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND\u2019S SHARE PRICE CAN ALSO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED DURING PERIODS OF HIGH REDEMPTION PRESSURES  AND/OR ILLIQUID MARKETS.  PRICE MOVEMENTS  CRUDE OIL FUTURES PRICES WERE VOLATILE  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS STARTED THE  PERIOD AT $47.21 PER BARREL. THE HIGH OF THE PERIOD WAS ON APRIL 23, 2019 WHEN THE AVERAGE PRICE REACHED $64.69 PER BARREL.  THE AVERAGE LOW OF THE PERIOD WAS THE STARTING PRICE FOR THE PERIOD, WHICH WAS $47.21 PER BARREL. THE PERIOD ENDED WITH THE  AVERAGE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AT $57.45 PER BARREL, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 21.69% OVER THE  PERIOD. USL\u2019S PER SHARE NAV BEGAN THE PERIOD AT $17.82 AND ENDED THE PERIOD AT $21.80 ON JUNE 30, 2019, AN  INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 22.33% OVER THE PERIOD. USL\u2019S PER SHARE NAV REACHED ITS HIGH FOR THE PERIOD ON APRIL  23, 2019 AT $24.36 AND ITS LOW FOR THE PERIOD WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD WHEN IT WAS $17.82. THE AVERAGE  BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS PRICES LISTED ABOVE BEGAN WITH THE FEBRUARY 2019 TO JANUARY 2020 CONTRACTS AND ENDED WITH  THE AUGUST 2019 TO JULY 2020 CONTRACTS. THE INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 21.69% ON THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK  OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS LISTED ABOVE IS A HYPOTHETICAL RETURN ONLY AND COULD NOT ACTUALLY BE ACHIEVED BY AN INVESTOR HOLDING OIL  FUTURES CONTRACTS. AN INVESTMENT IN OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS WOULD NEED TO BE ROLLED FORWARD DURING THE TIME PERIOD DESCRIBED  IN ORDER TO SIMULATE SUCH A RESULT. FURTHERMORE, THE CHANGE IN THE NOMINAL PRICE OF THESE DIFFERING OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS, MEASURED  FROM THE START OF THE PERIOD TO THE END OF THE PERIOD, DOES NOT REPRESENT THE ACTUAL BENCHMARK RESULTS THAT USL SEEKS TO TRACK,  WHICH ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED BELOW IN THE SECTION TITLED \u201c  TRACKING USL'S BENCHMARK  .\u201d  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019,  THE CRUDE OIL FUTURES MARKET WAS IN A STATE OF CONTANGO, MEANING THAT THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT WAS  LOWER THAN THE PRICE OF THE NEXT MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT, OR CONTRACTS FURTHER AWAY FROM EXPIRATION. ON DAYS WHEN THE  MARKET IS IN BACKWARDATION, THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT IS TYPICALLY HIGHER THAN THE PRICE OF THE NEXT  MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT OR CONTRACTS FURTHER AWAY FROM EXPIRATION. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF BACKWARDATION AND  CONTANGO ON TOTAL RETURNS, SEE  \u201cTERM STRUCTURE OF CRUDE OIL PRICES AND THE IMPACT ON TOTAL RETURNS\u201d  BELOW.  20  VALUATION OF OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AND  THE COMPUTATION OF THE PER SHARE NAV  THE PER SHARE NAV OF USL\u2019S SHARES  IS CALCULATED ONCE EACH NYSE ARCA TRADING DAY. THE PER SHARE NAV FOR A PARTICULAR TRADING DAY IS RELEASED AFTER 4:00 P.M. NEW YORK  TIME. TRADING DURING THE CORE TRADING SESSION ON THE NYSE ARCA TYPICALLY CLOSES AT 4:00 P.M. NEW YORK TIME. USL\u2019S ADMINISTRATOR  USES THE NYMEX CLOSING PRICE (DETERMINED AT THE EARLIER OF THE CLOSE OF THE NYMEX OR 2:30 P.M. NEW YORK TIME) FOR THE CONTRACTS  HELD ON THE NYMEX, BUT CALCULATES OR DETERMINES THE VALUE OF ALL OTHER USL INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING ICE FUTURES CONTRACTS OR OTHER  FUTURES CONTRACTS, AS OF THE EARLIER OF THE CLOSE OF THE NYSE ARCA OR 4:00 P.M. NEW YORK TIME.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE CRUDE  OIL MARKET  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  ON DECEMBER  6, 2007, USL LISTED ITS SHARES ON THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE (THE \u201cAMEX\u201d) UNDER THE TICKER SYMBOL \u201cUSL.\u201d  ON THAT DAY, USL ESTABLISHED ITS INITIAL OFFERING PRICE AT $50.00 PER SHARE AND ISSUED 300,000 SHARES TO THE INITIAL AUTHORIZED  PARTICIPANT IN EXCHANGE FOR $15,000,000 IN CASH. AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE AMEX BY NYSE EURONEXT, USL\u2019S SHARES  CEASED TRADING ON THE AMEX AND COMMENCED TRADING ON THE NYSE ARCA ON NOVEMBER 25, 2008.  SINCE ITS INITIAL OFFERING OF 11,000,000  SHARES, USL HAS REGISTERED ONE SUBSEQUENT OFFERING OF ITS SHARES: 100,000,000 SHARES WHICH WERE REGISTERED WITH THE SEC ON MARCH  31, 2009. SHARES OFFERED BY USL IN THE SUBSEQUENT OFFERINGS WERE SOLD BY IT FOR CASH AT THE SHARES\u2019 PER SHARE NAV AS DESCRIBED  IN THE APPLICABLE PROSPECTUS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, USL HAD ISSUED 23,250,000 SHARES, 2,500,000 OF WHICH WERE OUTSTANDING. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019, THERE WERE 87,750,000 SHARES REGISTERED BUT NOT YET ISSUED.  MORE SHARES MAY HAVE BEEN ISSUED BY USL  THAN ARE OUTSTANDING DUE TO THE REDEMPTION OF SHARES. UNLIKE FUNDS THAT ARE REGISTERED UNDER THE 1940 ACT, SHARES THAT HAVE BEEN  REDEEMED BY USL CANNOT BE RESOLD BY USL. AS A RESULT, USL CONTEMPLATES THAT ADDITIONAL OFFERINGS OF ITS SHARES WILL BE REGISTERED  WITH THE SEC IN THE FUTURE IN ANTICIPATION OF ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES AND REDEMPTIONS.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, USL HAD THE FOLLOWING  AUTHORIZED PARTICIPANTS: CITADEL SECURITIES LLC, CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC., GOLDMAN SACHS & COMPANY, JP MORGAN SECURITIES  INC., MERRILL LYNCH PROFESSIONAL CLEARING CORP., MORGAN STANLEY & COMPANY INC., NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL INC., RBC  CAPITAL MARKETS LLC, SG AMERICAS SECURITIES LLC, AND VIRTU FINANCIAL BD LLC.  21  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  FOR THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  FOR THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS  $59,205,666  $85,328,246  DIVIDEND AND INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON TREASURIES, CASH AND/OR CASH EQUIVALENTS  $689,066  $642,491  ANNUALIZED YIELD BASED ON AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS  2.35%  1.52%  MANAGEMENT FEE  $176,157  $253,881  TOTAL FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES EXCLUDING MANAGEMENT FEES  $90,882  $90,795  TOTAL COMMISSIONS ACCRUED TO BROKERS  $3,857  $3,219  TOTAL COMMISSIONS AS ANNUALIZED PERCENTAGE OF AVERAGE TOTAL NET ASSETS  0.01%  0.01%  COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF REBALANCING  $3,446  $2,439  PERCENTAGE OF COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF REBALANCING  89.34%  75.77%  COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF CREATION AND REDEMPTION ACTIVITY  $411  $780  PERCENTAGE OF COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF CREATION AND REDEMPTION ACTIVITY  10.66%  24.23%  PORTFOLIO EXPENSES.  USL\u2019S  EXPENSES CONSIST OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES, BROKERAGE FEES AND COMMISSIONS, CERTAIN OFFERING COSTS, LICENSING FEES, REGISTRATION  FEES, THE FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF USCF AND EXPENSES RELATING TO TAX ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  THE MANAGEMENT FEE THAT USL PAYS TO USCF IS CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL NET ASSETS OF USL. THE FEE IS ACCRUED  DAILY AND PAID MONTHLY.  AVERAGE INTEREST RATES EARNED ON SHORT-TERM  INVESTMENTS HELD BY USL, INCLUDING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND TREASURIES, WERE HIGHER DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019, COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. AS A RESULT, THE AMOUNT OF INCOME EARNED BY USL AS A PERCENTAGE  OF AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS WAS HIGHER DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  THE CHANGE IN TOTAL FEES AND OTHER  EXPENSES EXCLUDING MANAGEMENT FEES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE  30, 2018 WAS NEGLIGIBLE.  THE INCREASE IN TOTAL COMMISSIONS ACCRUED  TO BROKERS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, WAS DUE PRIMARILY  TO A HIGHER NUMBER OF OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS BEING HELD AND TRADED.  22  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS  $58,522,315  $84,621,388  DIVIDEND AND INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON TREASURIES, CASH AND/OR CASH EQUIVALENTS  $346,813  $347,526  ANNUALIZED YIELD BASED ON AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS  2.38%  1.65%  MANAGEMENT FEE  $87,543  $126,585  TOTAL FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES EXCLUDING MANAGEMENT FEES  $45,432  $45,712  TOTAL COMMISSIONS ACCRUED TO BROKERS  $1,985  $2,645  TOTAL COMMISSIONS AS ANNUALIZED PERCENTAGE OF AVERAGE TOTAL NET ASSETS  0.01%  0.01%  COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF REBALANCING  $1,623  $2,405  PERCENTAGE OF COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF REBALANCING  81.76%  90.93%  COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF CREATION AND REDEMPTION ACTIVITY  $362  $240  PERCENTAGE OF COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF CREATION AND REDEMPTION ACTIVITY  18.24%  9.07%  PORTFOLIO EXPENSES.  USL\u2019S  EXPENSES CONSIST OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES, BROKERAGE FEES AND COMMISSIONS, CERTAIN OFFERING COSTS, LICENSING FEES, REGISTRATION  FEES, THE FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF USCF AND EXPENSES RELATING TO TAX ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  THE MANAGEMENT FEE THAT USL PAYS TO USCF IS CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL NET ASSETS OF USL. THE FEE IS ACCRUED DAILY  AND PAID MONTHLY.  AVERAGE INTEREST RATES EARNED ON SHORT-TERM  INVESTMENTS HELD BY USL, INCLUDING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND TREASURIES, WERE HIGHER DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019,  COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. AS A RESULT, THE AMOUNT OF INCOME EARNED BY USL AS A PERCENTAGE OF AVERAGE  DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS WAS HIGHER DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2018.  THE CHANGE IN TOTAL FEES AND OTHER  EXPENSES EXCLUDING MANAGEMENT FEES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  WAS NEGLIGIBLE.  THE DECREASE IN TOTAL COMMISSIONS ACCRUED  TO BROKERS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A LOWER NUMBER  OF FUTURES CONTRACTS BEING HELD AND TRADED.  23  TRACKING USL'S BENCHMARK  USCF SEEKS TO MANAGE USL'S PORTFOLIO SUCH  THAT CHANGES IN ITS AVERAGE DAILY PER SHARE NAV, ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS, CLOSELY TRACK THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE OF  THE PRICES OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS, ALSO ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS. SPECIFICALLY, USCF SEEKS TO MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO  SUCH THAT OVER ANY ROLLING PERIOD OF 30-VALUATION DAYS, THE AVERAGE DAILY CHANGE IN USL'S PER SHARE NAV IS WITHIN A RANGE  OF 90% TO 110% (0.9 TO 1.1) OF THE AVERAGE DAILY CHANGE IN THE PRICES OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. AS AN EXAMPLE,  IF THE AVERAGE DAILY MOVEMENT OF THE AVERAGE OF THE PRICES OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR A PARTICULAR 30-VALUATION  DAY TIME PERIOD WAS 0.50% PER DAY, USCF WOULD ATTEMPT TO MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO SUCH THAT THE AVERAGE DAILY MOVEMENT OF THE PER SHARE  NAV DURING THAT SAME TIME PERIOD FELL BETWEEN 0.45% AND 0.55% (I.E., BETWEEN 0.9 AND 1.1 OF THE BENCHMARK\u2019S RESULTS). USL'S  PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT GOALS DO NOT INCLUDE TRYING TO MAKE THE NOMINAL PRICE OF USL'S PER SHARE NAV EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE OF  THE NOMINAL PRICES OF THE CURRENT BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS OR THE SPOT PRICE FOR LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL. USCF BELIEVES  THAT IT IS NOT PRACTICAL TO MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO TO ACHIEVE SUCH AN INVESTMENT GOAL WHEN INVESTING IN OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS  AND OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS.  FOR THE 30-VALUATION DAYS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019, THE SIMPLE AVERAGE DAILY CHANGE IN THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS WAS (0.235)%, WHILE THE SIMPLE AVERAGE DAILY  CHANGE IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF USL OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD WAS (0.229)%. THE AVERAGE DAILY DIFFERENCE WAS 0.006% (OR 0.6  BASIS POINTS, WHERE 1 BASIS POINT EQUALS 1/100 OF 1%). AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE DAILY MOVEMENT OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS,  THE AVERAGE ERROR IN DAILY TRACKING BY THE PER SHARE NAV WAS (2.224)%, MEANING THAT OVER THIS TIME PERIOD USL\u2019S TRACKING  ERROR WAS WITHIN THE PLUS OR MINUS 10% RANGE ESTABLISHED AS ITS BENCHMARK TRACKING GOAL. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE LEVEL  OF USL'S RELATIVE TRACKING ERROR AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE BENCHMARK WAS DUE TO PERIODS OF FLAT PRICE RETURNS.  SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE OFFERING  OF USL\u2019S SHARES TO THE PUBLIC ON DECEMBER 6, 2007 TO JUNE 30, 2019, THE SIMPLE AVERAGE DAILY CHANGE IN THE BENCHMARK  OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS WAS (0.008)%, WHILE THE SIMPLE AVERAGE DAILY CHANGE IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF USL OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD  WAS (0.009)%. THE AVERAGE DAILY DIFFERENCE WAS (0.001)% (OR (0.1) BASIS POINTS, WHERE 1 BASIS POINT EQUALS 1/100 OF 1%). AS  A PERCENTAGE OF THE DAILY MOVEMENT OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS, THE AVERAGE ERROR IN DAILY TRACKING BY THE PER SHARE  NAV WAS (0.578)%, MEANING THAT OVER THIS TIME PERIOD USL\u2019S TRACKING ERROR WAS WITHIN THE PLUS OR MINUS 10% RANGE ESTABLISHED  AS ITS BENCHMARK TRACKING GOAL. THE FOLLOWING TWO GRAPHS DEMONSTRATE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE CHANGES IN USL\u2019S NAV AND  THE CHANGES IN THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. THE FIRST GRAPH EXHIBITS THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE LAST 30 VALUATION DAYS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019. THE SECOND GRAPH MEASURES MONTHLY CHANGES SINCE JUNE 30, 2014 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2019.  *PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS  24  *PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS  AN ALTERNATIVE TRACKING MEASUREMENT OF  THE RETURN PERFORMANCE OF USL VERSUS THE RETURN OF ITS BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS CAN BE CALCULATED BY COMPARING  THE ACTUAL AVERAGE OF THE PRICES OF ITS RETURN OF USL, MEASURED BY CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE NAV, VERSUS THE EXPECTED CHANGES IN  ITS PER SHARE NAV UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT USL\u2019S RETURNS HAD BEEN EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE OF  THE PRICES OF ITS BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019, THE ACTUAL TOTAL RETURN OF USL AS MEASURED BY CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE NAV WAS 22.33%. THIS IS BASED ON AN INITIAL PER  SHARE NAV OF $17.82 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND AN ENDING PER SHARE NAV AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 OF $21.80. DURING THIS TIME  PERIOD, USL MADE NO DISTRIBUTIONS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS. HOWEVER, IF USL\u2019S DAILY CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE NAV HAD INSTEAD  EXACTLY TRACKED THE CHANGES IN THE DAILY TOTAL RETURN OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS, USL WOULD HAVE HAD AN ESTIMATED  PER SHARE NAV OF $21.64 AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, FOR A TOTAL RETURN OVER THE RELEVANT TIME PERIOD OF 21.44%. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  THE ACTUAL PER SHARE NAV TOTAL RETURN OF USL OF 22.33% AND THE EXPECTED TOTAL RETURN BASED ON THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS  OF 21.44% WAS AN ERROR OVER THE TIME PERIOD OF 0.89%, WHICH IS TO SAY THAT USL\u2019S ACTUAL TOTAL RETURN OUTPERFORMED ITS BENCHMARK BY  THAT PERCENTAGE. USL INCURS EXPENSES PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF THE MANAGEMENT FEE, BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS FOR THE BUYING AND SELLING  OF FUTURES CONTRACTS, AND OTHER EXPENSES. THE IMPACT OF THESE EXPENSES, OFFSET BY INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME, AND NET OF POSITIVE  OR NEGATIVE EXECUTION, TENDS TO CAUSE DAILY CHANGES IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF USL TO TRACK SLIGHTLY LOWER OR HIGHER THAN  DAILY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS.  BY COMPARISON, FOR THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, THE ACTUAL TOTAL RETURN OF USL AS MEASURED BY CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE NAV WAS 20.52%. THIS WAS BASED  ON AN INITIAL PER SHARE NAV OF $21.05 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND AN ENDING PER SHARE NAV AS OF JUNE 30, 2018 OF $25.37.  DURING THIS TIME PERIOD, USL MADE NO DISTRIBUTIONS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS. HOWEVER, IF USL\u2019S DAILY CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE  NAV HAD INSTEAD EXACTLY TRACKED THE CHANGES IN THE DAILY TOTAL RETURN OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS, USL WOULD HAVE  HAD AN ESTIMATED PER SHARE NAV OF $25.28 AS OF JUNE 30, 2018, FOR A TOTAL RETURN OVER THE RELEVANT TIME PERIOD OF 20.10%. THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN THE ACTUAL PER SHARE NAV TOTAL RETURN OF USL OF 20.52% AND THE EXPECTED TOTAL RETURN BASED ON THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES  CONTRACTS OF 20.10% WAS AN ERROR OVER THE TIME PERIOD OF 0.42%, WHICH IS TO SAY THAT USL\u2019S ACTUAL TOTAL RETURN OUTPERFORMED  ITS BENCHMARK BY THAT PERCENTAGE. USL INCURRED EXPENSES PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF THE MANAGEMENT FEE, BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS FOR  THE BUYING AND SELLING OF FUTURES CONTRACTS, AND OTHER EXPENSES. THE IMPACT OF THESE EXPENSES, OFFSET BY INTEREST AND DIVIDEND  INCOME, AND NET OF POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EXECUTION, TENDED TO CAUSE DAILY CHANGES IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF USL TO TRACK SLIGHTLY  LOWER OR HIGHER THAN DAILY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS.  25  THERE ARE CURRENTLY THREE FACTORS  THAT HAVE IMPACTED OR ARE MOST LIKELY TO IMPACT USL'S ABILITY TO ACCURATELY TRACK ITS BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS.  FIRST, USL MAY BUY OR SELL ITS  HOLDINGS IN THE THEN CURRENT BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AT A PRICE OTHER THAN THE CLOSING SETTLEMENT PRICE OF THAT CONTRACT  ON THE DAY DURING WHICH USL EXECUTES THE TRADE. IN THAT CASE, USL MAY PAY A PRICE THAT IS HIGHER, OR LOWER, THAN THAT  OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE CHANGES IN THE DAILY PER SHARE NAV OF USL TO EITHER BE TOO HIGH  OR TOO LOW RELATIVE TO THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. DURING THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, USCF ATTEMPTED TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS BY SEEKING TO EXECUTE ITS PURCHASE OR SALE OF  THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AT, OR AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO, THE END OF THE DAY SETTLEMENT PRICE. HOWEVER, IT MAY NOT  ALWAYS BE POSSIBLE FOR USL TO OBTAIN THE CLOSING SETTLEMENT PRICE AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT FAILURE TO OBTAIN THE CLOSING  SETTLEMENT PRICE IN THE FUTURE WILL NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT USL'S ATTEMPT TO TRACK THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS.  SECOND, USL INCURS EXPENSES PRIMARILY  COMPOSED OF THE MANAGEMENT FEE, BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS FOR THE BUYING AND SELLING OF FUTURES CONTRACTS, AND OTHER EXPENSES. THE  IMPACT OF THESE EXPENSES TENDS TO CAUSE DAILY CHANGES IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF USL TO TRACK SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN DAILY CHANGES  IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. AT THE SAME TIME, USL EARNS DIVIDEND AND INTEREST INCOME ON ITS CASH,  CASH EQUIVALENTS AND TREASURIES. USL IS NOT REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE ANY PORTION OF ITS INCOME TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND DID NOT  MAKE ANY DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. INTEREST PAYMENTS, AND ANY OTHER INCOME,  WERE RETAINED WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO AND ADDED TO USL'S NAV. WHEN THIS INCOME EXCEEDS THE LEVEL OF USL'S EXPENSES FOR ITS  MANAGEMENT FEE, BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS AND OTHER EXPENSES (INCLUDING ONGOING REGISTRATION FEES, LICENSING FEES AND THE FEES AND  EXPENSES OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF USCF), USL WILL REALIZE A NET YIELD THAT WILL TEND TO CAUSE DAILY CHANGES IN THE  PER SHARE NAV OF USL TO TRACK SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN DAILY CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE OF THE PRICES OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES  CONTRACTS. IF SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES RISE ABOVE THE CURRENT LEVELS, THE LEVEL OF DEVIATION CREATED BY THE YIELD WOULD INCREASE.  CONVERSELY, IF SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES WERE TO DECLINE, THE AMOUNT OF ERROR CREATED BY THE YIELD WOULD DECREASE. WHEN SHORT-TERM  YIELDS DROP TO A LEVEL LOWER THAN THE COMBINED EXPENSES OF THE MANAGEMENT FEE AND THE BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS, THEN THE TRACKING  ERROR BECOMES A NEGATIVE NUMBER AND WOULD TEND TO CAUSE THE DAILY RETURNS OF THE PER SHARE NAV TO UNDERPERFORM THE DAILY RETURNS  OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. USCF ANTICIPATES THAT INTEREST RATES MAY STAGNATE OVER THE NEAR FUTURE FROM HISTORICAL  LOWS. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT FEES AND EXPENSES PAID BY USL MAY CONTINUE TO BE LOWER THAN INTEREST EARNED BY USL. AS SUCH,  USCF ANTICIPATES THAT USL COULD POSSIBLY OUTPERFORM ITS BENCHMARK SO LONG AS INTEREST EARNED AT LEAST EQUALS OR EXCEEDS THE  FEES AND EXPENSES PAID BY USL.  THIRD, USL MAY HOLD OTHER OIL-RELATED  INVESTMENTS IN ITS PORTFOLIO THAT MAY FAIL TO CLOSELY TRACK THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS' TOTAL RETURN MOVEMENTS. IN  THAT CASE, THE ERROR IN TRACKING THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS COULD RESULT IN DAILY CHANGES IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF USL  THAT ARE EITHER TOO HIGH, OR TOO LOW, RELATIVE TO THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, USL DID NOT HOLD ANY OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS. IF USL INCREASES  IN SIZE, AND DUE TO ITS OBLIGATIONS TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY LIMITS, USL MAY INVEST IN OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS WHICH MAY  HAVE THE EFFECT OF INCREASING TRANSACTION RELATED EXPENSES AND MAY RESULT IN INCREASED TRACKING ERROR.  TERM STRUCTURE OF CRUDE OIL FUTURES  PRICES AND THE IMPACT ON TOTAL RETURNS.  SEVERAL FACTORS DETERMINE THE TOTAL RETURN FROM INVESTING IN FUTURES CONTRACTS. ONE  FACTOR ARISES FROM \u201cROLLING\u201d FUTURES CONTRACTS THAT WILL EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE CURRENT MONTH (THE \u201cNEAR\u201d  OR \u201cFRONT\u201d MONTH CONTRACT) FORWARD EACH MONTH PRIOR TO EXPIRATION. FOR A STRATEGY THAT ENTAILS HOLDING THE NEAR MONTH  CONTRACT, THE PRICE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT FUTURES CONTRACT AND THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WILL IMPACT RETURNS. FOR EXAMPLE,  IF THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS HIGHER THAN THE NEXT FUTURES MONTH CONTRACT (A SITUATION REFERRED TO AS \u201cBACKWARDATION\u201d),  THEN ABSENT ANY OTHER CHANGE, THE PRICE OF A NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT TENDS TO RISE IN VALUE AS IT BECOMES THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES  CONTRACT AND APPROACHES EXPIRATION. CONVERSELY, IF THE PRICE OF A NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS LOWER THAN THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES  CONTRACT (A SITUATION REFERRED TO AS \u201cCONTANGO\u201d), THEN ABSENT ANY OTHER CHANGE, THE PRICE OF A NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT  TENDS TO DECLINE IN VALUE AS IT BECOMES THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT AND APPROACHES EXPIRATION.  AS AN EXAMPLE, ASSUME THAT THE PRICE OF CRUDE  OIL FOR IMMEDIATE DELIVERY, IS $50 PER BARREL, AND THE VALUE OF A POSITION IN THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS ALSO $50. OVER  TIME, THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON A NUMBER OF MARKET FACTORS, INCLUDING DEMAND FOR OIL RELATIVE TO  SUPPLY. THE VALUE OF THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WILL LIKEWISE FLUCTUATE IN REACTION TO A NUMBER OF MARKET FACTORS. IF AN INVESTOR  SEEKS TO MAINTAIN A POSITION IN A NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT AND NOT TAKE DELIVERY OF PHYSICAL BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL, THE  INVESTOR MUST SELL THE CURRENT NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT AS IT APPROACHES EXPIRATION AND INVEST IN THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT.  IN ORDER TO CONTINUE HOLDING A POSITION IN THE CURRENT NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT, THIS \u201cROLL\u201d FORWARD OF THE FUTURES  CONTRACT MUST BE EXECUTED EVERY MONTH.  CONTANGO AND BACKWARDATION ARE NATURAL  MARKET FORCES THAT HAVE IMPACTED THE TOTAL RETURN ON AN INVESTMENT IN USL\u2019S SHARES DURING THE PAST YEAR RELATIVE TO A HYPOTHETICAL  DIRECT INVESTMENT IN CRUDE OIL. IN THE FUTURE, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MARKET PRICE OF USL\u2019S SHARES  AND CHANGES IN THE SPOT PRICES OF LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY CONTANGO AND BACKWARDATION. IT IS  IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS COMPARISON IGNORES THE POTENTIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PHYSICALLY OWNING AND STORING CRUDE OIL, WHICH  COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL.  26  IF THE FUTURES MARKET IS IN BACKWARDATION,  E.G., WHEN THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS HIGHER THAN THE PRICE OF THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT, THE INVESTOR  WOULD BUY A NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT FOR A LOWER PRICE THAN THE CURRENT NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT. ASSUMING THE PRICE OF THE  NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WAS $49 PER BARREL, OR 2% CHEAPER THAN THE $50 NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT, THEN, HYPOTHETICALLY, AND  ASSUMING NO OTHER CHANGES (E.G., TO EITHER PREVAILING CRUDE OIL PRICES OR THE PRICE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SPOT PRICE, THE  NEAR MONTH CONTRACT AND THE NEXT MONTH CONTRACT, AND, IGNORING THE IMPACT OF COMMISSION COSTS AND THE INCOME EARNED ON CASH AND/OR  CASH EQUIVALENTS), THE VALUE OF THE $49 NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WOULD RISE TO $50 AS IT APPROACHES EXPIRATION. IN THIS EXAMPLE,  THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WOULD TEND TO OUTPERFORM THE SPOT PRICE OF CRUDE OIL. AS A RESULT,  IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR THE NEW NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT TO RISE 12% WHILE THE SPOT PRICE OF CRUDE OIL MAY HAVE RISEN  A LOWER AMOUNT, E.G., ONLY 10%. SIMILARLY, THE SPOT PRICE OF CRUDE OIL COULD HAVE FALLEN 10% WHILE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT  IN THE FUTURES CONTRACT MIGHT HAVE FALLEN ANOTHER AMOUNT, E.G., ONLY 8%. OVER TIME, IF BACKWARDATION REMAINED CONSTANT, THIS DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN THE SPOT PRICE AND THE FUTURES CONTRACT PRICE WOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE.  IF THE FUTURES MARKET IS IN CONTANGO, AN  INVESTOR WOULD BE BUYING A NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT FOR A HIGHER PRICE THAN THE CURRENT NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT.  AGAIN, ASSUMING THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS $50 PER BARREL, THE PRICE OF THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT MIGHT BE $51  PER BARREL, OR 2% MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE FRONT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT. HYPOTHETICALLY, AND ASSUMING NO OTHER CHANGES, THE VALUE  OF THE $51 NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WOULD FALL TO $50 AS IT APPROACHES EXPIRATION. IN THIS EXAMPLE, THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT  IN THE SECOND MONTH WOULD TEND TO UNDERPERFORM THE SPOT PRICE OF CRUDE OIL. AS A RESULT, IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR THE NEW NEAR  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT TO RISE ONLY 10% WHILE THE SPOT PRICE OF CRUDE OIL MAY HAVE RISEN A HIGHER AMOUNT, E.G., 12%. SIMILARLY,  THE SPOT PRICE OF CRUDE OIL COULD HAVE FALLEN 10% WHILE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE SECOND MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT MIGHT  HAVE FALLEN ANOTHER AMOUNT, E.G., 12%. OVER TIME, IF CONTANGO REMAINED CONSTANT, THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SPOT PRICE AND THE  FUTURES CONTRACT PRICE WOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE.  THE CHART BELOW COMPARES THE DAILY PRICE  OF THE NEAR MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT TO THE PRICE OF 13  TH  MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT (I.E.,  A CONTRACT ONE YEAR FORWARD) OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS. WHEN THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS HIGHER THAN THE PRICE  OF THE 13  TH  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT, THE MARKET WOULD BE DESCRIBED AS BEING IN BACKWARDATION. WHEN THE PRICE OF THE NEAR  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS LOWER THAN THE 13  TH  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT, THE MARKET WOULD BE DESCRIBED AS BEING IN CONTANGO.  ALTHOUGH THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT AND THE PRICE OF THE 13  TH  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT TEND TO  MOVE TOGETHER, IT CAN BE SEEN THAT AT TIMES THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT PRICES ARE HIGHER THAN THE 13  TH  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT  PRICES (BACKWARDATION) AND, AT OTHER TIMES, THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT PRICES ARE LOWER THAN THE 13  TH  MONTH FUTURES  CONTRACT PRICES (CONTANGO).  *PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS  27  AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO VIEW THE SAME DATA  IS TO SUBTRACT THE DOLLAR PRICE OF THE 13  TH  MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT FROM THE DOLLAR PRICE OF THE NEAR  MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT, AS SHOWN IN THE CHART BELOW. WHEN THE DIFFERENCE IS POSITIVE, THE MARKET IS IN BACKWARDATION.  WHEN THE DIFFERENCE IS NEGATIVE, THE MARKET IS IN CONTANGO. THE CRUDE OIL MARKET SPENT TIME IN BOTH BACKWARDATION AND CONTANGO  DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS.  *PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS  AN INVESTMENT IN A PORTFOLIO THAT OWNED  ONLY THE NEAR MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT WOULD LIKELY PRODUCE A DIFFERENT RESULT THAN AN INVESTMENT IN A PORTFOLIO THAT OWNED  AN EQUAL NUMBER OF EACH OF THE NEAR 12 MONTHS\u2019 OF CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. GENERALLY SPEAKING, WHEN THE CRUDE OIL FUTURES  MARKET IS IN BACKWARDATION, A PORTFOLIO OF ONLY THE NEAR MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT MAY TEND TO HAVE A HIGHER TOTAL RETURN  THAN A PORTFOLIO OF 12 MONTHS\u2019 OF THE CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT. CONVERSELY, IF THE CRUDE OIL FUTURES MARKET WAS IN CONTANGO,  THE PORTFOLIO CONTAINING ONLY 12 MONTHS\u2019 OF CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS MAY TEND TO OUTPERFORM THE PORTFOLIO HOLDING ONLY  THE NEAR MONTH CRUDE OIL FUTURES CONTRACT.  HISTORICALLY, THE CRUDE OIL FUTURES MARKETS  HAVE EXPERIENCED PERIODS OF CONTANGO AND BACKWARDATION, WITH BACKWARDATION BEING IN PLACE SOMEWHAT LESS OFTEN THAN CONTANGO SINCE  OIL FUTURES TRADING STARTED IN 1982. FOLLOWING THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE CRUDE OIL MARKET  MOVED INTO CONTANGO AND REMAINED IN CONTANGO FOR A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS. DURING PARTS OF 2009, THE LEVEL OF CONTANGO WAS UNUSUALLY  STEEP AS A COMBINATION OF SLACK U.S. AND GLOBAL DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL AND ISSUES INVOLVING THE PHYSICAL TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE  OF CRUDE OIL AT CUSHING, OKLAHOMA, THE PRIMARY PRICING POINT FOR OIL TRADED IN THE U.S., LED TO UNUSUALLY HIGH INVENTORIES OF CRUDE  OIL. A COMBINATION OF IMPROVED TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE CAPACITY, ALONG WITH GROWING DEMAND FOR CRUDE OIL GLOBALLY, MODERATED  THE INVENTORY BUILD-UP AND LED TO REDUCED LEVELS OF CONTANGO BY 2011. HOWEVER, AT THE END OF NOVEMBER 2014, GLOBAL CRUDE OIL INVENTORIES  GREW RAPIDLY AFTER THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES (\u201cOPEC\u201d) VOTED TO DEFEND ITS MARKET SHARE AGAINST  U.S. SHALE-OIL PRODUCERS, RESULTING IN ANOTHER PERIOD DURING WHICH THE CRUDE OIL MARKET REMAINED PRIMARILY IN CONTANGO. THIS PERIOD  OF CONTANGO CONTINUED THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2017. DECLINING GLOBAL CRUDE OIL INVENTORIES CAUSED THE MARKET TO FLIP INTO BACKWARDATION  AT THE BEGINNING OF 2018 THROUGH LATE OCTOBER 2018, AT WHICH POINT ONGOING SUPPLY GROWTH IN THE U.S., COMBINED WITH INCREASED OPEC  PRODUCTION, ONCE AGAIN LED MARKET PARTICIPANTS TO FEAR ANOTHER GLOBAL GLUT OF CRUDE OIL. THE CRUDE OIL MARKET REMAINED IN CONTANGO  THROUGH JUNE 30, 2019.  28  USCF BELIEVES THAT HOLDING FUTURES CONTRACTS  WHOSE EXPIRATION DATES ARE SPREAD OUT OVER A 12 MONTH PERIOD OF TIME WILL CAUSE THE TOTAL RETURN OF SUCH A PORTFOLIO TO VARY COMPARED  TO A PORTFOLIO THAT HOLDS ONLY A SINGLE MONTH\u2019S CONTRACT (SUCH AS THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT). IN PARTICULAR, USCF BELIEVES  THAT THE TOTAL RETURN OF A PORTFOLIO HOLDING CONTRACTS WITH A RANGE OF EXPIRATION MONTHS WILL BE IMPACTED DIFFERENTLY BY THE PRICE  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIFFERENT CONTRACT MONTHS OF THE SAME COMMODITY FUTURE COMPARED TO THE TOTAL RETURN OF A PORTFOLIO CONSISTING  OF THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT. USCF BELIEVES THAT BASED ON HISTORICAL EVIDENCE A PORTFOLIO THAT HELD FUTURES CONTRACTS WITH A RANGE  OF EXPIRATION DATES SPREAD OUT OVER A 12 MONTH PERIOD OF TIME WOULD TYPICALLY BE IMPACTED LESS BY THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF BACKWARDATION,  AND LESS BY THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF CONTANGO, COMPARED TO A PORTFOLIO THAT HELD CONTRACTS OF A SINGLE NEAR MONTH. AS A RESULT, ABSENT  THE IMPACT OF ANY OTHER FACTORS, A PORTFOLIO OF 12 DIFFERENT MONTHLY CONTRACTS WOULD TEND TO HAVE A LOWER TOTAL RETURN THAN A NEAR  MONTH ONLY PORTFOLIO IN A BACKWARDATION MARKET AND A HIGHER TOTAL RETURN IN A CONTANGO MARKET. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE  THAT SUCH HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS WOULD PROVIDE THE SAME OR SIMILAR RESULTS IN THE FUTURE.  PERIODS OF CONTANGO OR BACKWARDATION DO  NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT USL\u2019S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE OF HAVING THE DAILY PERCENTAGE CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE NAV TRACK THE DAILY  PERCENTAGE CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS SINCE THE IMPACT OF BACKWARDATION AND CONTANGO TEND  TO EQUALLY IMPACT THE DAILY PERCENTAGE CHANGES IN PRICE OF BOTH USL\u2019S SHARES AND THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. IT  IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY WHETHER BACKWARDATION OR CONTANGO WILL OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. IT IS LIKELY  THAT BOTH CONDITIONS WILL OCCUR DURING DIFFERENT PERIODS.  CRUDE OIL MARKET.  DURING THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, CRUDE OIL PRICES TRADED IN A RANGE BETWEEN $45.41 TO $66.30. CRUDE OIL ROSE OVER 28.76% FROM THE END  OF 2018 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2019 FINISHING THE QUARTER AT $58.47. AS OF THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, U.S. CRUDE STORAGE  WAS 12% HIGHER THAN A YEAR AGO, AND 7% HIGHER THAN THE FIVE-YEAR AVERAGE LEVEL. STORAGE LEVELS ARE APPROXIMATELY 13% BELOW THE  ALL-TIME HIGH SET IN 2017. OPEC NATIONS AGREED IN NOVEMBER 2018 TO REDUCE DAILY SUPPLY BY 1.2 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY AND WERE  EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN THOSE CUTS AT THE CARTEL\u2019S SEMI-ANNUAL MEETING IN EARLY JULY. THE GROUP HAS BEEN AGGRESSIVE ABOUT MEETING  TARGET CUTS. DESPITE OPEC\u2019S CUTS, CONTINUED GROWTH IN US SHALE, FALLING DEMAND, SLOWING IN CHINA GDP GROWTH, AND IMPACT FROM  TRADE WARS CAUSED CRUDE PRICES TO MODERATE THIS QUARTER. WHILE CRUDE OIL PRICES HAVE EXHIBITED A DRAMATIC REVERSAL SINCE THE END  OF 2018, PRICES HAVE NOT YET RETURNED TO THE RECENT HIGH OF $76.41 SET ON OCTOBER 3, 2018. IF GLOBAL DEMAND AND DEMAND GROWTH STOPS  FALLING, THEN PRICES MAY STABILIZE IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2019. MEANWHILE, GEOPOLITICAL RISKS HAVE INCREASED, PARTICULARLY IN RESPECT  TO IRAN AND ITS THREATS TO DISRUPT ENERGY SHIPPING IN THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ.  CRUDE OIL PRICE MOVEMENTS IN COMPARISON  TO OTHER ENERGY COMMODITIES AND INVESTMENT CATEGORIES.  USCF BELIEVES THAT INVESTORS FREQUENTLY MEASURE THE DEGREE TO WHICH  PRICES OR TOTAL RETURNS OF ONE INVESTMENT OR ASSET CLASS MOVE UP OR DOWN IN VALUE IN CONCERT WITH ANOTHER INVESTMENT OR ASSET CLASS.  STATISTICALLY, SUCH A MEASURE IS USUALLY DONE BY MEASURING THE CORRELATION OF THE PRICE MOVEMENTS OF THE TWO DIFFERENT INVESTMENTS  OR ASSET CLASSES OVER SOME PERIOD OF TIME. THE CORRELATION IS SCALED BETWEEN 1 AND -1, WHERE 1 INDICATES THAT THE TWO INVESTMENT  OPTIONS MOVE UP OR DOWN IN PRICE OR VALUE TOGETHER, KNOWN AS \u201cPOSITIVE CORRELATION,\u201d AND -1 INDICATES THAT THEY MOVE  IN COMPLETELY OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS, KNOWN AS \u201cNEGATIVE CORRELATION.\u201d A CORRELATION OF 0 WOULD MEAN THAT THE MOVEMENTS  OF THE TWO ARE NEITHER POSITIVELY NOR NEGATIVELY CORRELATED, KNOWN AS \u201cNON-CORRELATION.\u201d THAT IS, THE INVESTMENT OPTIONS  SOMETIMES MOVE UP AND DOWN TOGETHER AND OTHER TIMES MOVE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.  29  FOR THE TEN-YEAR TIME PERIOD BETWEEN JUNE  30, 2009 AND JUNE 30, 2019, THE TABLE BELOW COMPARES THE MONTHLY MOVEMENTS OF CRUDE OIL PRICES VERSUS THE MONTHLY MOVEMENTS OF  THE PRICES OF SEVERAL OTHER ENERGY COMMODITIES, SUCH AS NATURAL GAS, DIESEL-HEATING OIL, AND UNLEADED GASOLINE, AS WELL AS SEVERAL  MAJOR NON-COMMODITY INVESTMENT ASSET CLASSES, SUCH AS LARGE CAP U.S. EQUITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT BONDS AND GLOBAL EQUITIES. IT CAN  BE SEEN THAT OVER THIS PARTICULAR TIME PERIOD, THE MOVEMENT OF CRUDE OIL ON A MONTHLY BASIS EXHIBITED STRONG CORRELATION WITH UNLEADED  GASOLINE AND DIESEL-HEATING OIL, MODERATE CORRELATION WITH THE MOVEMENTS OF LARGE CAP U.S. EQUITIES AND GLOBAL EQUITIES, LITTLE  CORRELATION WITH NATURAL GAS, AND MODERATE NEGATIVE CORRELATION WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT BONDS.  *PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS  U.S.  GOV\u2019T.

THE RESULTS PICTURED ABOVE WOULD  HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF A DIFFERENT RANGE OF DATES HAD BEEN SELECTED. USCF BELIEVES THAT CRUDE OIL HAS HISTORICALLY NOT DEMONSTRATED  A STRONG CORRELATION WITH EQUITIES OR BONDS OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME. HOWEVER, USCF ALSO BELIEVES THAT IN THE FUTURE IT IS POSSIBLE  THAT CRUDE OIL COULD HAVE LONG TERM CORRELATION RESULTS THAT INDICATE PRICES OF CRUDE OIL MORE CLOSELY TRACK THE MOVEMENTS OF EQUITIES  OR BONDS. IN ADDITION, USCF BELIEVES THAT, WHEN MEASURED OVER TIME PERIODS SHORTER THAN TEN YEARS, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOME PERIODS  WHERE THE CORRELATION OF CRUDE OIL TO EQUITIES AND BONDS WILL BE EITHER MORE STRONGLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED OR MORE STRONGLY NEGATIVELY  CORRELATED THAN THE LONG TERM HISTORICAL RESULTS SUGGEST.  THE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN CRUDE OIL, NATURAL  GAS, DIESEL-HEATING OIL AND GASOLINE ARE RELEVANT BECAUSE USCF ENDEAVORS TO INVEST USL\u2019S ASSETS IN OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS  AND OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS SO THAT DAILY CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS IN USL\u2019S PER SHARE NAV CORRELATE AS CLOSELY AS  POSSIBLE WITH DAILY CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS IN THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. IF CERTAIN OTHER FUEL-BASED  COMMODITY FUTURES CONTRACTS DO NOT CLOSELY CORRELATE WITH THE CRUDE-OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS, THEN THEIR USE COULD LEAD TO GREATER  TRACKING ERROR. AS NOTED ABOVE, USCF ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS IN THE AVERAGE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK OIL  FUTURES CONTRACTS WILL CLOSELY CORRELATE WITH CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS IN THE SPOT PRICE OF LIGHT, SWEET CRUDE OIL.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  PREPARATION OF THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN COMPLIANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  REQUIRES THE APPLICATION OF APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING RULES AND GUIDANCE, AS WELL AS THE USE OF ESTIMATES. USL'S APPLICATION  OF THESE POLICIES INVOLVES JUDGMENTS AND ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES USED.  USCF HAS EVALUATED THE NATURE AND TYPES  OF ESTIMATES THAT IT MAKES IN PREPARING USL'S CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES AND HAS DETERMINED THAT  THE VALUATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE NOT TRADED ON A UNITED STATES OR INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED FUTURES EXCHANGE (SUCH  AS FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OTC SWAPS) INVOLVES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY. THE VALUES WHICH ARE USED BY USL FOR ITS OIL  FUTURES CONTRACTS ARE PROVIDED BY ITS COMMODITY BROKER WHO USES MARKET PRICES WHEN AVAILABLE, WHILE OTC SWAPS ARE VALUED BASED  ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FROM OR PAID TO A THIRD PARTY IN SETTLEMENT OF THESE  DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS PRIOR TO THEIR DELIVERY DATE AND VALUED ON A DAILY BASIS. IN ADDITION, USL ESTIMATES INTEREST AND DIVIDEND  INCOME ON A DAILY BASIS USING PREVAILING RATES EARNED ON ITS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE ADJUSTED TO THE ACTUAL  AMOUNT RECEIVED ON A MONTHLY BASIS AND THE DIFFERENCE, IF ANY, IS NOT CONSIDERED MATERIAL.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  USL HAS NOT MADE, AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE  MAKING, USE OF BORROWINGS OR OTHER LINES OF CREDIT TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS. USL HAS MET, AND IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT USL  WILL CONTINUE TO MEET, ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS FROM THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE OF ITS INVESTMENTS, OR  FROM THE TREASURIES, CASH AND/OR CASH EQUIVALENTS THAT IT INTENDS TO HOLD AT ALL TIMES. USL'S LIQUIDITY NEEDS INCLUDE: REDEEMING  SHARES, PROVIDING MARGIN DEPOSITS FOR ITS EXISTING OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS OR THE PURCHASE OF ADDITIONAL OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS  AND POSTING COLLATERAL FOR ITS OTC SWAPS, IF APPLICABLE, AND PAYMENT OF ITS EXPENSES, SUMMARIZED BELOW UNDER  \u201cCONTRACTUAL  OBLIGATIONS.\u201d  USL CURRENTLY GENERATES CASH  PRIMARILY FROM: (I) THE SALE OF BASKETS CONSISTING OF 50,000 SHARES (\u201cCREATION BASKETS\u201d) AND (II) INCOME EARNED  ON TREASURIES, CASH AND/OR CASH EQUIVALENTS. USL HAS ALLOCATED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS NET ASSETS TO TRADING IN OIL INTERESTS. USL  INVESTS IN OIL INTERESTS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE WITHOUT BEING LEVERAGED OR UNABLE TO SATISFY ITS CURRENT OR POTENTIAL  MARGIN OR COLLATERAL OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO ITS INVESTMENTS IN OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS.  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF USL'S NAV IS HELD IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS THAT ARE USED AS MARGIN AND AS COLLATERAL FOR ITS  TRADING IN OIL INTERESTS. THE BALANCE OF THE ASSETS IS HELD IN USL'S ACCOUNT AT ITS CUSTODIAN BANK AND IN TREASURIES  AT THE FCM. INCOME RECEIVED FROM USL'S INVESTMENTS IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND TREASURIES IS PAID TO USL. DURING THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, USL'S EXPENSES DID NOT EXCEED THE INCOME USL EARNED AND THE CASH EARNED FROM THE SALE OF  CREATION BASKETS AND THE REDEMPTION OF REDEMPTION BASKETS. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, USL DID NOT USE OTHER ASSETS  TO PAY EXPENSES. TO THE EXTENT EXPENSES EXCEED INCOME, USL'S NAV WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.  31  USL'S INVESTMENTS IN OIL INTERESTS  MAY BE SUBJECT TO PERIODS OF ILLIQUIDITY BECAUSE OF MARKET CONDITIONS, REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS AND OTHER REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE,  MOST COMMODITY EXCHANGES LIMIT THE FLUCTUATIONS IN FUTURES CONTRACTS PRICES DURING A SINGLE DAY BY REGULATIONS REFERRED TO AS \u201cDAILY  LIMITS.\u201d DURING A SINGLE DAY, NO TRADES MAY BE EXECUTED AT PRICES BEYOND THE DAILY LIMIT. ONCE THE PRICE OF A FUTURES CONTRACT  HAS INCREASED OR DECREASED BY AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE DAILY LIMIT, POSITIONS IN THE CONTRACTS CAN NEITHER BE TAKEN NOR LIQUIDATED  UNLESS THE TRADERS ARE WILLING TO EFFECT TRADES AT OR WITHIN THE SPECIFIED DAILY LIMIT. SUCH MARKET CONDITIONS COULD PREVENT USL  FROM PROMPTLY LIQUIDATING ITS POSITIONS IN OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, USL DID NOT PURCHASE  OR LIQUIDATE ANY OF ITS POSITIONS WHILE DAILY LIMITS WERE IN EFFECT; HOWEVER, USL CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER SUCH AN EVENT  MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.  PRIOR TO THE INITIAL OFFERING OF USL, ALL  PAYMENTS WITH RESPECT TO USL\u2019S EXPENSES WERE PAID BY USCF. USL DOES NOT HAVE AN OBLIGATION OR INTENTION TO REFUND SUCH PAYMENTS  BY USCF. USCF IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PAY USL\u2019S CURRENT OR FUTURE EXPENSES. SINCE THE INITIAL OFFERING OF SHARES, USL HAS  BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPENSES RELATING TO: (I) MANAGEMENT FEES, (II) BROKERAGE FEES AND COMMISSIONS, (III) LICENSING FEES FOR THE  USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, (IV) ONGOING REGISTRATION EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH OFFERS AND SALES OF ITS SHARES SUBSEQUENT TO  THE INITIAL OFFERING, (V) OTHER EXPENSES, INCLUDING TAX REPORTING COSTS, (VI) FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF  USCF AND (VII) OTHER EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES NOT IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHILE USCF HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPENSES  RELATING TO THE FEES OF USL'S MARKETING AGENT, ADMINISTRATOR AND CUSTODIAN AND REGISTRATION EXPENSES RELATING TO THE INITIAL OFFERING  OF SHARES. IF USCF AND USL ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN RAISING SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO COVER THESE RESPECTIVE EXPENSES OR IN LOCATING ANY OTHER  SOURCE OF FUNDING, USL WILL TERMINATE AND INVESTORS MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF THEIR INVESTMENT.  MARKET RISK  TRADING IN OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AND  OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS FORWARDS, INVOLVES USL ENTERING INTO CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE OR SELL OIL  AT A SPECIFIED DATE IN THE FUTURE. THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED USL'S FUTURE CASH  REQUIREMENTS SINCE USL INTENDS TO CLOSE OUT ITS OPEN POSITIONS PRIOR TO SETTLEMENT. AS A RESULT, USL IS GENERALLY ONLY  SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS. USL CONSIDERS THE \u201cFAIR VALUE\u201d  OF ITS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO BE THE UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE CONTRACTS. THE MARKET RISK ASSOCIATED WITH USL'S COMMITMENTS  TO PURCHASE OIL IS LIMITED TO THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS HELD. HOWEVER, SHOULD USL ENTER INTO A CONTRACTUAL  COMMITMENT TO SELL OIL, IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE DELIVERY OF THE OIL AT THE CONTRACT PRICE, REPURCHASE THE CONTRACT AT PREVAILING  PRICES OR SETTLE IN CASH. SINCE THERE ARE NO LIMITS ON THE FUTURE PRICE OF OIL, THE MARKET RISK TO USL COULD BE UNLIMITED.  USL'S EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK DEPENDS  ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE MARKETS FOR OIL, THE VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, THE LIQUIDITY  OF THE OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS MARKETS AND THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE CONTRACTS HELD BY USL.  DRASTIC MARKET OCCURRENCES COULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE LOSS OF ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF AN INVESTOR\u2019S CAPITAL.  CREDIT RISK  WHEN USL ENTERS INTO OIL FUTURES  CONTRACTS AND OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS, IT IS EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK THAT THE COUNTERPARTY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET ITS  OBLIGATIONS. THE COUNTERPARTY FOR THE OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE NYMEX AND ON MOST OTHER FUTURES EXCHANGES IS  THE CLEARINGHOUSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PARTICULAR EXCHANGE. IN GENERAL, IN ADDITION TO MARGIN REQUIRED TO BE POSTED BY THE CLEARINGHOUSE  IN CONNECTION WITH CLEARED TRADES, CLEARINGHOUSES ARE BACKED BY THEIR MEMBERS WHO MAY BE REQUIRED TO SHARE IN THE FINANCIAL BURDEN  RESULTING FROM THE NONPERFORMANCE OF ONE OF THEIR MEMBERS AND, THEREFORE, THIS ADDITIONAL MEMBER SUPPORT SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE  CREDIT RISK. USL IS NOT CURRENTLY A MEMBER OF ANY CLEARINGHOUSE. SOME FOREIGN EXCHANGES ARE NOT BACKED BY THEIR CLEARINGHOUSE  MEMBERS BUT MAY BE BACKED BY A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, USL FACES THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE  BY ANY COUNTERPARTIES TO OTC CONTRACTS. UNLIKE IN THE CASE OF EXCHANGE-TRADED FUTURES CONTRACTS, THE COUNTERPARTY TO AN OTC CONTRACT  IS GENERALLY A SINGLE BANK OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. AS A RESULT, THERE WILL BE GREATER COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK IN OTC TRANSACTIONS.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY COUNTERPARTY, CLEARINGHOUSE, OR THEIR MEMBERS OR THEIR FINANCIAL BACKERS WILL SATISFY THEIR  OBLIGATIONS TO USL IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.  USCF ATTEMPTS TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK  OF USL BY FOLLOWING VARIOUS TRADING LIMITATIONS AND POLICIES. IN PARTICULAR, USL GENERALLY POSTS MARGIN AND/OR HOLDS  LIQUID ASSETS THAT ARE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE MARKET VALUE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS TO COUNTERPARTIES UNDER THE OIL FUTURES  CONTRACTS AND OTHER OIL-RELATED INVESTMENTS IT HOLDS. USCF HAS IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES THAT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO,  EXECUTING AND CLEARING TRADES ONLY WITH CREDITWORTHY PARTIES AND/OR REQUIRING THE POSTING OF COLLATERAL OR MARGIN BY SUCH PARTIES  FOR THE BENEFIT OF USL TO LIMIT ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE. AN FCM, WHEN ACTING ON BEHALF OF USL IN ACCEPTING ORDERS TO PURCHASE  OR SELL OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS ON UNITED STATES EXCHANGES, IS REQUIRED BY CFTC REGULATIONS TO SEPARATELY ACCOUNT FOR AND SEGREGATE  AS BELONGING TO USL, ALL ASSETS OF USL RELATING TO DOMESTIC OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADING. THESE FCMS ARE NOT ALLOWED  TO COMMINGLE USL'S ASSETS WITH THEIR OTHER ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THE CFTC REQUIRES FCMS TO HOLD IN A SECURE ACCOUNT USL'S  ASSETS RELATED TO FOREIGN OIL FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADING.  32  IN THE FUTURE, USL MAY PURCHASE OTC  SWAPS, SEE  \u201cITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\u201d  IN THIS QUARTERLY  REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR A DISCUSSION OF OTC SWAPS.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, USL HELD CASH  DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS IN TREASURIES AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS IN THE AMOUNT OF $57,233,158 WITH THE CUSTODIAN AND FCM. SOME OR  ALL OF THESE AMOUNTS HELD BY A CUSTODIAN OR AN FCM, AS APPLICABLE, MAY BE SUBJECT TO LOSS SHOULD USL'S CUSTODIAN OR FCM, AS  APPLICABLE, CEASE OPERATIONS.  OFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, USL HAD NO LOAN  GUARANTEE, CREDIT SUPPORT OR OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OF ANY KIND OTHER THAN AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO IN THE NORMAL  COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN RISKS THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS UNDERTAKE IN  PERFORMING SERVICES WHICH ARE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF USL. WHILE USL'S EXPOSURE UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS CANNOT  BE ESTIMATED, THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON USL'S FINANCIAL POSITION.  EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT  USL HAD NO DIRECT EXPOSURE TO EUROPEAN  SOVEREIGN DEBT AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 AND HAS NO DIRECT EXPOSURE TO EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT AS OF THE FILING OF THIS QUARTERLY  REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  REDEMPTION BASKET OBLIGATION  IN ORDER TO MEET ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE  AND PAY ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS DESCRIBED BELOW, USL REQUIRES LIQUIDITY TO REDEEM SHARES, WHICH REDEMPTIONS MUST BE IN  BLOCKS OF 50,000 SHARES CALLED \u201cREDEMPTION BASKETS.\u201d USL HAS TO DATE SATISFIED THIS OBLIGATION BY PAYING  FROM THE CASH OR CASH EQUIVALENTS IT HOLDS OR THROUGH THE SALE OF ITS TREASURIES IN AN AMOUNT PROPORTIONATE TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES  BEING REDEEMED.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  USL'S PRIMARY CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  ARE WITH USCF. IN RETURN FOR ITS SERVICES, USCF IS ENTITLED TO A MANAGEMENT FEE CALCULATED DAILY AND PAID MONTHLY AS A FIXED PERCENTAGE  OF USL'S NAV, CURRENTLY 0.60% OF NAV ON ITS AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REFERENCES  MADE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q TO \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cOUR,\u201d \u201cUS,\u201d \u201cINTELLICHECK,\u201d  OR THE \u201cCOMPANY,\u201d REFER TO INTELLICHECK, INC.  THE  FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSTITUTES MANAGEMENT\u2019S REVIEW OF  THE FACTORS THAT AFFECTED OUR FINANCIAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. THIS DISCUSSION  SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO CONTAINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT AND IN OUR ANNUAL  REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. ON DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE MERGED OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, MOBILISA,  INC. (\u201cMOBILISA\u201d) AND POSITIVE ACCESS CORPORATION (\u201cPOSITIVE ACCESS\u201d) INTO ONE COMPANY UNDER INTELLICHECK.  AS OF AND PRIOR TO DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE CONSOLIDATED AND INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF INTELLICHECK AND THESE  SUBSIDIARIES. ALL INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED UPON CONSOLIDATION.  OVERVIEW  WE  ARE A PROMINENT TECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT IS ENGAGED IN DEVELOPING, INTEGRATING AND MARKETING IDENTITY AUTHENTICATION AND THREAT  IDENTIFICATION SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES THAT INCLUDE BANK AND RETAIL FRAUD PREVENTION, LAW ENFORCEMENT THREAT IDENTIFICATION,  AND MOBILE AND HANDHELD ACCESS CONTROL AND SECURITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT, MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS. OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE  RETAIL ID\u00ae, A SOLUTION FOR PREVENTING FRAUD IN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY; AGE ID\u00ae, A SMARTPHONE OR TABLET-BASED SOLUTION FOR  PREVENTING SALE OF AGE-RESTRICTED PRODUCTS TO MINORS; LAW ID\u00ae, A SMARTPHONE-BASED SOLUTION USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS  TO IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE THREATS; AND DEFENSE ID\u00ae, A MOBILE AND FIXED INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTION FOR THREAT IDENTIFICATION, IDENTITY  AUTHENTICATION AND ACCESS CONTROL TO MILITARY BASES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT FACILITIES.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE USE OF ESTIMATES  THE  PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED  STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS INCLUDE IMPAIRMENT CONSIDERATION AND VALUATION OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES,  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  PLANS. DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN MAKING ESTIMATES, ACTUAL RESULTS REPORTED IN FUTURE PERIODS MAY BE DIFFERENT  FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  18  WE  BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING OUR HISTORICAL AND FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AS  THESE POLICIES AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND THE MORE SIGNIFICANT AREAS INVOLVING MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENTS AND  ESTIMATES. THESE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES RELATE TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, DEFERRED TAXES AND COMMITMENTS  AND CONTINGENCIES. THESE POLICIES AND OUR PROCEDURES RELATED TO THESE POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL BELOW.  GOODWILL  THE  EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES IS CONSIDERED GOODWILL. UNDER AUTHORITATIVE  GUIDANCE, PURCHASED GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT RATHER IT IS PERIODICALLY REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT. WE HAD GOODWILL OF $8,101,661  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019. THIS GOODWILL RESULTED FROM THE ACQUISITIONS OF MOBILISA AND POSITIVE ACCESS.  FOR  THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. UNDER AUTHORITATIVE  GUIDANCE, WE CAN USE INDUSTRY AND COMPANY SPECIFIC QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT IMPAIRMENT  EXISTS, BEFORE USING A TWO-STEP QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS. EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH COULD TRIGGER AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW  INCLUDE MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS, COST FACTORS, OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, OTHER ENTITY SPECIFIC  EVENTS AND SUSTAINED DECREASE IN SHARE PRICE. WE PERFORMED THE FIRST STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY  POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING OUR FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY TO OUR CARRYING AMOUNT, INCLUDING GOODWILL. THE FAIR VALUE WAS  DETERMINED USING THE WEIGHTING OF CERTAIN VALUATION TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING BOTH INCOME AND MARKET APPROACHES WHICH INCLUDE A DISCOUNTED  CASH FLOW ANALYSIS, AN ESTIMATION OF AN IMPLIED CONTROL PREMIUM, IN ADDITION TO OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE.  THE IMPLIED CONTROL PREMIUM SELECTED WAS DEVELOPED BASED ON CERTAIN OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES. THE MARKET  CAPITALIZATION IS SENSITIVE TO THE VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK PRICE. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT THE FACTORS CONSIDERED IN THE IMPAIRMENT  ANALYSIS ARE REASONABLE, CHANGES IN ANY ONE OF THE ASSUMPTIONS USED COULD HAVE PRODUCED A DIFFERENT RESULT WHICH MAY HAVE LED  TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. ANY FUTURE IMPAIRMENT LOSS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LONG-TERM ASSETS AND OPERATING  EXPENSES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IMPAIRMENT IS DETERMINED TO EXIST.  FOR  THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR VALUE WAS MORE THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AND THEREFORE THE SECOND  STEP OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WAS NOT REQUIRED.  WE  DETERMINED THAT NO EVENTS OCCURRED OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGED DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN  NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNTS. WE WILL, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR STOCK PRICE AND  OPERATIONS FOR ANY POTENTIAL INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT. WE WILL CONDUCT THE 2019 ANNUAL TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT IN THE FOURTH  QUARTER, OR AT SUCH TIME WHERE AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT APPEARS TO EXIST.  INTANGIBLE  ASSETS  OUR  INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST OF TRADE NAMES, PATENTS AND NON-CONTRACTUAL CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. WE DETERMINED THAT NO EVENTS OCCURRED  OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGED DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS  BELOW OUR CARRYING AMOUNTS. WE WILL, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO MONITOR ANY POTENTIAL INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT.  REVENUE  RECOGNITION AND DEFERRED REVENUE  THE  MAJORITY OF LICENSE FEES AND SERVICES REVENUE ARE GENERATED FROM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS, WHICH PROVIDE FOR LICENSES TO SOFTWARE  PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMIZE SUCH SOFTWARE TO MEET THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 USE. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, CUSTOMIZATION SERVICES  ARE DETERMINED TO BE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE DELIVERED SOFTWARE. UNDER ASC 606, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN A CUSTOMER  OBTAINS CONTROL OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE  FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. WE MEASURE REVENUE BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION SPECIFIED IN A CUSTOMER ARRANGEMENT, AND REVENUE IS  RECOGNIZED WHEN THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN AN ARRANGEMENT ARE SATISFIED. A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS A PROMISE IN A CONTRACT  TO TRANSFER A DISTINCT SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER. THE TRANSACTION PRICE OF A CONTRACT IS ALLOCATED TO EACH DISTINCT PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATION AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN OR AS, THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE BENEFIT OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. CUSTOMERS TYPICALLY  RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF OUR SERVICES AS THEY ARE PERFORMED. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL CUSTOMER CONTRACTS PROVIDE THAT WE ARE COMPENSATED  FOR SERVICES PERFORMED TO DATE.  19  INVOICING  IS BASED ON SCHEDULES ESTABLISHED IN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS. PAYMENT TERMS ARE GENERALLY ESTABLISHED AT 30 DAYS FROM THE INVOICE DATE.  PRODUCT RETURNS ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE.  REVENUE  IS MEASURED BASED ON A CONSIDERATION SPECIFIED IN A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER, AND EXCLUDES ANY SALES INCENTIVES AND AMOUNTS COLLECTED  ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES. REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER,  IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. FURTHERMORE,  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN WE SATISFY A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BY TRANSFERRING CONTROL OVER A PRODUCT OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER.  STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION  WE  ACCOUNT FOR THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC TOPIC 718 AND 505, WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE COST  RESULTING FROM ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS PRONOUNCEMENT ESTABLISHES  FAIR VALUE AS THE MEASUREMENT OBJECTIVE IN ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND REQUIRES ALL COMPANIES TO APPLY  A FAIR VALUE BASED MEASUREMENT METHOD IN ACCOUNTING FOR ALL SHARE BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS WITH EMPLOYEES.  DEFERRED  INCOME TAXES  DEFERRED  TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL  STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES AND NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY FORWARDS.  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING EXPECTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR THE YEAR IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES  ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED. WE HAVE RECORDED A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AS OF JUNE  30, 2019, DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THOSE ASSETS.  COMMITMENTS  AND CONTINGENCIES  WE  ARE NOT CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.  THE  ABOVE LISTING IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ALL OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES. IN MANY CASES, THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT  OF A PARTICULAR TRANSACTION IS SPECIFICALLY DICTATED BY GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, WITH NO NEED FOR MANAGEMENT\u2019S  JUDGMENT IN THEIR APPLICATION. THERE ARE ALSO AREAS IN WHICH MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT IN SELECTING ANY AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVE  WOULD NOT PRODUCE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULT.  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  (ALL FIGURES HAVE BEEN ROUNDED TO THE NEAREST $1,000)  COMPARISON  OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  REVENUES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 INCREASED 56% TO $1,558,000 COMPARED TO $1,001,000 FOR THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THE INCREASE  IN REVENUES IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER COMMERCIAL REVENUES OFFSET BY A DECREASE  IN DEFENSE ID  \u00ae  REVENUES. SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE (\u201cSAAS\u201d) REVENUE, WHICH CONSISTS OF SOFTWARE LICENSED  ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS, INCREASED $496,000 OR 79% TO $1,121,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $625,000  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  GROSS  PROFIT INCREASED BY $420,000 TO $1,339,000 FOR THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $919,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE  30, 2018. OUR GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES, WAS 85.9% AND 91.8% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018,  RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN PERCENTAGE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED HOSTING COSTS ON OUR SAAS REVENUE. AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY  OUR MARGINS, ARE EXPECTED TO NORMALIZE IN THE 85% RANGE.  20  OPERATING  EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST OF SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, INCREASED $196,000 OR 10%  TO $2,259,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $2,063,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THIS INCREASE  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT FOR DEVELOPMENT PERSONNEL, LEGAL FEES AND A NEW ANNUAL EXECUTIVE BONUS PLAN BASED  ON CERTAIN GOALS ACHIEVED BY US PLUS INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENTS BY EACH EXECUTIVE.  INTEREST  AND OTHER INCOME WAS INSIGNIFICANT IN THE THREE MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018.  WE  HAVE INCURRED NET LOSSES TO DATE; THEREFORE, WE HAVE PAID NOMINAL INCOME TAXES.  AS  A RESULT OF THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY GENERATED A NET LOSS OF $874,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED  TO A NET LOSS OF $1,100,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  COMPARISON  OF THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  REVENUES  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 INCREASED 37% TO $2,837,000 COMPARED TO $2,063,000 FOR THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THE INCREASE  IN REVENUES IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER COMMERCIAL REVENUES OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN  DEFENSE ID  \u00ae  REVENUES. SAAS REVENUE INCREASED $763,000 OR 63% TO $1,982,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO $1,219,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  GROSS  PROFIT INCREASED BY $545,000 TO $2,426,000 FOR SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $1,881,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2018. OUR GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES, WAS 85.5% AND 91.1% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE IN PERCENTAGE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED HOSTING COSTS ON OUR SAAS REVENUE. AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY OUR MARGINS,  ARE EXPECTED TO NORMALIZE IN THE 85% RANGE.  OPERATING  EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST OF SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, INCREASED $458,000 OR 11%  TO $4,564,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $4,106,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THIS INCREASE  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS, AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT FOR DEVELOPMENT PERSONNEL AND A NEW ANNUAL  EXECUTIVE BONUS PLAN BASED ON CERTAIN GOALS ACHIEVED BY US PLUS INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENTS BY EACH EXECUTIVE.  INTEREST  AND OTHER INCOME WAS INSIGNIFICANT IN THE SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018.  WE  HAVE INCURRED NET LOSSES TO DATE; THEREFORE, WE HAVE PAID NOMINAL INCOME TAXES.  AS  A RESULT OF THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY GENERATED A NET LOSS OF $2,087,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED  TO A NET LOSS OF $2,168,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  (ALL FIGURES HAVE BEEN ROUNDED TO THE NEAREST $1,000)  AS  OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD CASH OF $3,061,000, WORKING CAPITAL (DEFINED AS CURRENT ASSETS MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES) OF $2,884,000,  TOTAL ASSETS OF $13,436,000 AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY OF $11,543,000.  DURING  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE USED NET CASH OF $1,597,000 IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS COMPARED TO NET CASH USED OF $2,128,000  IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $14,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO CASH USED INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $108,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  WAS $268,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $688,000 FOR THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  ON  FEBRUARY 6, 2019 WE ENTERED INTO A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH CITIBANK THAT ALLOWS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO THE LESSER OF (I)  $2,000,000 OR (II) THE COLLATERALIZED BALANCE IN OUR EXISTING FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT ACCOUNT WITH CITIBANK. THE FACILITY BEARS  INTEREST AT A RATE CONSISTENT OF CITIBANK\u2019S BASE RATE (7% AT JUNE 30, 2019) MINUS 2% SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. INTEREST  IS PAYABLE MONTHLY AND AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THERE WERE NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS FACILITY AND UNUSED AVAILABILITY UNDER  THIS FACILITY WAS $2,000,000.  21  WE  CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH, EXPECTED CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT,  WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  WE  KEEP THE OPTION OPEN TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO RESPOND TO BUSINESS CONTINGENCIES WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE NEED TO FUND MORE RAPID  EXPANSION, FUND ADDITIONAL MARKETING EXPENDITURES, DEVELOP NEW MARKETS FOR OUR TECHNOLOGY, ENHANCE OUR OPERATING INFRASTRUCTURE,  RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, OR ACQUIRE COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES OR NECESSARY TECHNOLOGIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT  WE WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN NEEDED OR OBTAIN SUCH ON TERMS SATISFACTORY TO US, IF AT ALL.  WE  HAVE FILED A UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d),  WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JULY 19, 2010. UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, WE MAY OFFER AND SELL, FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE  FUTURE IN ONE OR MORE PUBLIC OFFERINGS, OUR COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK, WARRANTS, AND UNITS. THE AGGREGATE INITIAL OFFERING  PRICE OF ALL SECURITIES SOLD BY US WILL NOT EXCEED $25,000,000, AND, PURSUANT TO SEC RULES, WE MAY ONLY SELL UP TO ONE-THIRD OF  THE MARKET CAP HELD BY NON-AFFILIATE STOCKHOLDERS IN ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD. WE RENEWED THIS REGISTRATION WITH THE SEC ON OCTOBER  21, 2016 AND IT WAS DECLARED EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 4, 2016.  THE  SPECIFIC TERMS OF ANY FUTURE OFFERING, INCLUDING THE PRICES AND USE OF PROCEEDS, WILL BE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF ANY SUCH OFFERING  AND WILL BE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL IN A PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT WHICH WILL BE FILED WITH THE SEC AT THE TIME OF THE OFFERING.  THE  SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT IS DESIGNED TO GIVE THE COMPANY THE FLEXIBILITY TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AT SOME POINT IN THE  FUTURE WHEN MARKET CONDITIONS ARE APPROPRIATE.  WE  ARE NOT CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN ANY LEGAL OR REGULATORY PROCEEDING, OR ARBITRATION, THE OUTCOME OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL  EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.  NET  OPERATING LOSS CARRY FORWARDS  OUR  AVAILABLE NET OPERATING LOSS (\u201cNOL\u201d) AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION. THE FEDERAL AND STATE NOL\u2019S  INCURRED IN ALL YEARS THROUGH 2017 ARE AVAILABLE TO OFFSET FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND EXPIRE FROM 2019 THROUGH 2038 IF NOT UTILIZED.  THE 2018 GROSS NOL INCURRED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 CAN BE UTILIZED AT 80% WITH NO EXPIRATION.  ADJUSTED  EBITDA  WE  USE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CALCULATED BY ADDING BACK TO NET LOSS,  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, INCOME TAXES, IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION EXPENSE. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS PROVIDED TO INVESTORS TO SUPPLEMENT THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE  WITH GAAP. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADJUSTED EBITDA PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL TOOL FOR INVESTORS TO USE IN COMPARING OUR FINANCIAL  RESULTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES THAT ALSO USE ADJUSTED EBITDA IN THEIR COMMUNICATIONS TO INVESTORS. BY EXCLUDING NON-CASH CHARGES  SUCH AS IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL, AMORTIZATION, DEPRECIATION AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AS WELL AS NON-OPERATING  CHARGES FOR INTEREST AND INCOME TAXES, INVESTORS CAN EVALUATE OUR OPERATIONS AND CAN COMPARE THE RESULTS ON A MORE CONSISTENT  BASIS TO THE RESULTS OF OTHER COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY MEASURES MANAGEMENT USES TO MONITOR  AND EVALUATE FINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS.  WE  CONSIDER ADJUSTED EBITDA TO BE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF OUR OPERATIONAL STRENGTH AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS AND A USEFUL  MEASURE OF OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING TRENDS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS TO THE USE OF ADJUSTED EBITDA SINCE IT  EXCLUDES INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, ALL OF WHICH  IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY, AS WELL AS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION RELATED TO THE USE OF LONG-TERM ASSETS WHICH BENEFIT MULTIPLE  PERIODS. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE LIMITATIONS ARE COMPENSATED BY PROVIDING ADJUSTED EBITDA ONLY WITH GAAP NET LOSS AND CLEARLY IDENTIFYING  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO MEASURES. CONSEQUENTLY, ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE  FOR NET LOSS PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. ADJUSTED EBITDA AS DEFINED BY US MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE WITH SIMILARLY NAMED MEASURES  PROVIDED BY OTHER ENTITIES.  22  A  RECONCILIATION OF GAAP NET LOSS TO NON-GAAP ADJUSTED EBITDA FOLLOWS.

THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ADDITION OF ONE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOAN TOTALING $2.4 MILLION BEING PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS.  IN 2016, THE CORPORATION PURCHASED A PARTICIPATION INTEREST IN THIS LOAN FROM ANOTHER LOCAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.  THE PROCEEDS OF THE LOAN, WHICH WAS ORIGINATED AS A CONSTRUCTION LOAN WITH A PERMANENT FINANCING MORTGAGE LOAN UPON COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION, WAS USED BY THE BORROWER TO CONSTRUCT AN APARTMENT COMPLEX LOCATED IN BEAVER COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE DEVELOPER OF THE PROPERTY WAS INDICTED ON MULTIPLE CHARGES OF FRAUD. ALSO, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE FINANCIALS INITIALLY PROVIDED TO OBTAIN THE FINANCING FOR THE PROJECT MAY HAVE CONTAINED FRAUDULENT INFORMATION WHICH CAUSED THE LEAD BANK TO DEMAND THAT THE OUTSTANDING LOAN BE PAID IN FULL.  IN ADDITION, THE LEAD LENDER COMMENCED FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS AND THE PROPERTY WAS PLACED INTO RECEIVERSHIP DURING THE QUARTER. AT JUNE 30, 2019, THE LOAN WAS IN ARREARS AND THEREFORE CONSIDERED A NONPERFORMING LOAN.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE CORPORATION\u2019S CLASSIFIED AND CRITICIZED ASSETS AMOUNTED TO $25.5 MILLION, OR 2.8% OF TOTAL ASSETS, WITH $19.8 MILLION CLASSIFIED AS SUBSTANDARD AND $5.7 MILLION IDENTIFIED AS SPECIAL MENTION.

THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO TWO ADDITIONAL COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS TOTALING $4.9 MILLION BEING CLASSIFIED AS SUBSTANDARD IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.  THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES DECREASED $30,000, OR 10.0%, TO $270,000 FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  FROM $300,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  AS LOAN BALANCES DECLINED $8.5 MILLION DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  . THE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED $2.4 MILLION COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP WHICH WAS DOWNGRADED TO SUBSTANDARD AND PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WAS INDIVIDUALLY EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT AND BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ANALYSIS OF THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL PLEDGED ON THE LOAN, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NO ADDITIONAL PROVISION WAS REQUIRED WITH RESPECT TO SUCH LOAN. THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES RECORDED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  WAS HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO OF $3.0 MILLION.  NONINTEREST INCOME.  NONINTEREST INCOME INCREASED $82,000, OR 7.8%, TO $1.1 MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO $1.0 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . FEES AND SERVICE CHARGES INCREASED $73,000 PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPERATION OF THE NEW FULL-SERVICE BANKING OFFICES WHICH WERE ACQUIRED FROM COMMUNITY FIRST AND GENERAL INCREASES IN OVERDRAFT FEE INCOME.  NONINTEREST EXPENSE.  NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $85,000, OR 1.6%, TO $5.3 MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  FROM $5.2 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THE INCREASE PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCREASES IN COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSE AND OTHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE OF $266,000 AND $227,000, RESPECTIVELY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN ACQUISTION COSTS OF $358,000.   THE INCREASES PRIMARILY RELATED TO COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED NEW BANKING OFFICES AND NORMAL SALARY AND BENEFIT AND OPERATING EXPENSE INCREASES.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  .

THIS INCREASE RESULTED FROM A $117.0 MILLION, OR 19.9%, INCREASE IN AVERAGE LOANS, ACCOUNTING FOR AN INCREASE OF $2.7 MILLION IN INTEREST INCOME. THE INCREASE IN LOANS RECEIVABLE WAS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF COMMUNITY FIRST BANCORP, INC. IN OCTOBER 2018 AND STRONG LOAN GROWTH DURING 2018. ADDING TO THIS FAVORABLE VOLUME VARIANCE, THE AVERAGE YIELD ON LOANS INCREASED 21 BASIS POINTS TO 4.69% FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , VERSUS 4.48% FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THIS FAVORABLE YIELD VARIANCE ACCOUNTED FOR A $635,000 INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME.

DIVIDENDS ON FEDERAL BANK STOCKS INCREASED $55,000, OR 35.0%, TO $212,000 FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  FROM $157,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $1.4 MILLION, OR 31.8%, INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE BALANCE OF FEDERAL BANK STOCKS, ACCOUNTING FOR A $51,000 INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME.  FURTHERMORE, AN INCREASE OF 18 BASIS POINTS IN THE AVERAGE YIELD ON FEDERAL BANK STOCKS TO 7.27% FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , VERSUS 7.09% FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , ACCOUNTED FOR A $4,000 INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME.

THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ADDITION OF TWO COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS TOTALING $2.6 MILLION AND ONE RESIDENTIAL LOAN TOTALING $423,000 BEING PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  . THIS INCLUDED THE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED $2.4 MILLION COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOAN FOR THE APARTMENT COMPLEX IN BEAVER COUNTY.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE CORPORATION\u2019S CLASSIFIED AND CRITICIZED ASSETS AMOUNTED TO $25.5 MILLION, OR 2.8% OF TOTAL ASSETS, WITH $19.8 MILLION CLASSIFIED AS SUBSTANDARD AND $5.7 MILLION IDENTIFIED AS SPECIAL MENTION. THIS COMPARES TO CLASSIFIED AND CRITICIZED ASSETS OF $22.9 MILLION, OR 2.5% OF TOTAL ASSETS, WITH $16.4 MILLION CLASSIFIED AS SUBSTANDARD AND $6.5 MILLION IDENTIFIED AS SPECIAL MENTION AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE ADDITION OF TWO COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS TOTALING $4.9 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PAYOFFS OF FIVE COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS TOTALING $2.2 MILLION AND THE TRANSFER TO OREO OF ONE COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP TOTALING $232,000.  THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES DECREASED $230,000, OR 33.8%, TO $450,000 FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  FROM $680,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  AS LOAN BALANCES DECLINED $16.9 MILLION DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND PORTFOLIO NET CHARGE-OFFS WERE LOWER THAN NORMAL. ADDITIONALLY, THE $2.4 MILLION COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP, WHICH WAS DOWNGRADED TO SUBSTANDARD AND PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WAS INDIVIDUALLY EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT, AND DUE TO SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL VALUES, WAS DETERMINED TO NO LONGER NEED AN ALLOWANCE ALLOCATED TO IT. THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES RECORDED FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  WAS HIGHER DUE TO GROWTH IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO OF $10.0 MILLION AND HIGHER THAN NORMAL NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR THE PERIOD.  NONINTEREST INCOME.  NONINTEREST INCOME INCREASED $242,000, OR 12.4%, TO $2.2 MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO $1.9 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . FEES AND SERVICE CHARGES INCREASED $191,000, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPERATION OF THE NEW FULL-SERVICE BANKING OFFICES WHICH WERE ACQUIRED FROM COMMUNITY FIRST AND GENERAL INCREASES IN OVERDRAFT FEE INCOME.  NONINTEREST EXPENSE.  NONINTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $908,000, OR 9.1%, TO $10.9 MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  FROM $10.0 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THE INCREASE PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCREASES IN COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSE, OTHER NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSE OF $730,000, $489,000 AND $198,000, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASES PRIMARILY RELATED TO COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED NEW BANKING OFFICES AND NORMAL SALARY AND BENEFIT AND OPERATING EXPENSE INCREASES.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  . THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCREASED $381,000, OR 69.5%, TO $929,000 FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO $548,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  36  LIQUIDITY  THE CORPORATION\u2019S PRIMARY SOURCES OF FUNDS GENERALLY HAVE BEEN DEPOSITS OBTAINED THROUGH THE OFFICES OF THE BANK, BORROWINGS FROM THE FHLB, FEDERAL RESERVE AND OTHER CORRESPONDENT BANKS, AND AMORTIZATION AND PREPAYMENTS OF OUTSTANDING LOANS AND MATURING SECURITIES. DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , THE CORPORATION USED ITS SOURCES OF FUNDS PRIMARILY TO REDUCE SHORT-TERM BORROWED FUNDS AND INCREASE INTEREST EARNING TIME DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENT BALANCES. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE CORPORATION HAD OUTSTANDING LOAN COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING UNDISBURSED LOANS AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER CREDIT LINES, TOTALING $99.3 MILLION, AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT TOTALING $712,000, NET OF COLLATERAL MAINTAINED BY THE BANK.  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , TIME DEPOSITS AMOUNTED TO $224.3 MILLION, OR 28.8% OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DEPOSITS, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $71.9 MILLION OF WHICH ARE SCHEDULED TO MATURE WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR. MANAGEMENT OF THE CORPORATION BELIEVES (I) IT HAS ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO FUND ALL OF ITS COMMITMENTS, (II) ALL OF ITS COMMITMENTS WILL BE FUNDED AS REQUIRED BY RELATED MATURITY DATES AND (III) BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT PRICING POLICIES, IT CAN ADJUST THE RATES OF TIME DEPOSITS TO RETAIN A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF MATURING LIABILITIES IF NECESSARY.  ASIDE FROM LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE FROM CUSTOMER DEPOSITS OR THROUGH SALES AND MATURITIES OF SECURITIES, THE CORPORATION AND THE BANK HAVE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDS. THESE SOURCES INCLUDE A LINE OF CREDIT FOR THE CORPORATION WITH A CORRESPONDENT BANK, THE BANK'S LINE OF CREDIT AND TERM BORROWING CAPACITY FROM THE FHLB AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE\u2019S DISCOUNT WINDOW AND, TO A MORE LIMITED EXTENT, THROUGH THE SALE OF LOANS. AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE CORPORATION HAD BORROWED FUNDS OF $34.1 MILLION CONSISTING OF $30.0 MILLION OF LONG-TERM FHLB ADVANCES, A $2.0 MILLION LONG-TERM ADVANCE WITH A CORRESPONDENT BANK AND $2.1 MILLION OUTSTANDING ON A LINE OF CREDIT WITH A CORRESPONDENT BANK. AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE CORPORATION\u2019S BORROWING CAPACITY WITH THE FHLB, NET OF FUNDS BORROWED AND IRREVOCABLE STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUE TO SECURE CERTAIN DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS, WAS $249.9 MILLION.  MANAGEMENT IS NOT AWARE OF ANY CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ANY REGULATORY RECOMMENDATIONS OR REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT ITS LIQUIDITY OR ITS ABILITY TO MEET FUNDING NEEDS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.  RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS  THE FINAL RULES IMPLEMENTING THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION\u2019S (BCBS) CAPITAL GUIDELINES FOR U.S. BANKS WERE APPROVED BY THE FRB AND FDIC. UNDER THE FINAL RULES, MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS INCREASED FOR BOTH THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF CAPITAL. THE RULES INCLUDE A NEW COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS MINIMUM RATIO OF 4.5%, RAISE THE MINIMUM RATIO OF TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS FROM 4.0% TO 6.0%, REQUIRE A MINIMUM RATIO OF TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS OF 8.0% AND REQUIRE A MINIMUM TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4.0%. A NEW CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER COMPRISED OF COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL WAS ALSO ESTABLISHED ABOVE THE REGULATORY MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THIS CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER WAS PHASED IN BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2016 AT 0.625% OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS AND HAS INCREASED EACH SUBSEQUENT YEAR BY AN ADDITIONAL 0.625% UNTIL REACHING ITS FINAL LEVEL OF 2.5% ON JANUARY 1, 2019. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR REGULATORY CAPITAL INSTRUMENTS WERE ALSO IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE FINAL RULES. THE FINAL RULES ALSO REVISED THE DEFINITION AND CALCULATION OF TIER 1 CAPITAL, TOTAL CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. THE PHASE-IN PERIOD FOR THE FINAL RULES BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2015 WITH FULL COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE FINAL RULES\u2019 REQUIREMENTS PHASED IN OVER A MULTI-YEAR SCHEDULE WHICH WAS FULLY PHASED-IN ON JANUARY 1, 2019.  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE BANK EXCEEDED ALL MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER THESE CAPITAL GUIDELINES.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE CORPORATION\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND FOLLOW GENERAL PRACTICES WITHIN THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH IT OPERATES. APPLICATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS OF THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; ACCORDINGLY, AS THIS INFORMATION CHANGES, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COULD REFLECT DIFFERENT ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS. CERTAIN POLICIES INHERENTLY HAVE A GREATER RELIANCE ON THE USE OF ESTIMATES, AND AS SUCH HAVE A GREATER POSSIBILITY OF PRODUCING RESULTS THAT COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN ORIGINALLY REPORTED. ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS ARE NECESSARY WHEN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, WHEN A DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF AN ASSET NOT CARRIED ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT FAIR VALUE WARRANTS AN IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWN OR VALUATION RESERVE TO BE ESTABLISHED OR WHEN AN ASSET OR LIABILITY NEEDS TO BE RECORDED CONTINGENT UPON A FUTURE EVENT. CARRYING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE INHERENTLY RESULTS IN MORE FINANCIAL STATEMENT VOLATILITY. THE FAIR VALUES AND THE INFORMATION USED TO RECORD VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS FOR CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE BASED EITHER ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR ARE PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, WHEN AVAILABLE. WHEN THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE ESTIMATED IN GOOD FAITH BY MANAGEMENT PRIMARILY THOUGH THE USE OF INTERNAL CASH FLOW MODELING TECHNIQUES.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOLLOWED BY THE CORPORATION ARE PRESENTED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE CORPORATION\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THESE POLICIES, ALONG WITH THE DISCLOSURES PRESENTED IN THE OTHER FINANCIAL STATEMENT NOTES PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HOW SIGNIFICANT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE VALUED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND HOW THOSE VALUES ARE DETERMINED. MANAGEMENT VIEWS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO BE THOSE WHICH ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AND WHERE CHANGES IN THOSE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT HAS IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING AS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES.  THE CORPORATION CONSIDERS THAT THE DETERMINATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES INVOLVES A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND COMPLEXITY THAN ITS OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. THE BALANCE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS DETERMINED BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO IN RELATION TO PAST LOSS EXPERIENCE, THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE PORTFOLIO, CURRENT ECONOMIC EVENTS AND CONDITIONS AND OTHER PERTINENT FACTORS, INCLUDING MANAGEMENT\u2019S ASSUMPTIONS AS TO FUTURE DELINQUENCIES, RECOVERIES AND LOSSES. ALL OF THESE FACTORS MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. AMONG THE MANY FACTORS AFFECTING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, SOME ARE QUANTITATIVE WHILE OTHERS REQUIRE QUALITATIVE JUDGMENT. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ITS PROCESS FOR DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE ADEQUATELY CONSIDERS ALL OF THE POTENTIAL FACTORS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN CREDIT LOSSES, THE PROCESS INCLUDES SUBJECTIVE ELEMENTS AND MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT ACTUAL OUTCOMES DIFFER FROM MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATES, ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR LOAN LOSSES MAY BE REQUIRED THAT WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE CORPORATION\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR EARNINGS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT.  MANAGEMENT EVALUATES DEBT SECURITIES FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, AND MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN ECONOMIC, MARKET OR OTHER CONCERNS WARRANT SUCH EVALUATION. CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO (1) THE LENGTH OF TIME AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN COST, (2) THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, (3) WHETHER THE MARKET DECLINE WAS AFFECTED BY MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND (4) WHETHER THE CORPORATION HAS THE INTENT TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY OR MORE LIKELY THAN NOT WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE DEBT SECURITY BEFORE ITS ANTICIPATED RECOVERY.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS COST OVER FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION AND DETERMINED TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE ARE NOT AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH ESTIMABLE USEFUL LIVES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR RESPECTIVE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES TO THEIR ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES. GOODWILL IS SUBJECT TO ONGOING PERIODIC IMPAIRMENT TESTS BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IMPAIRMENT EXISTS WHEN A REPORTING UNIT\u2019S CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE. AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE REQUIRED ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL WAS PERFORMED AND NO IMPAIRMENT EXISTED AS OF THE VALUATION DATE. IF FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD IT IS DETERMINED THAT THERE HAS BEEN IMPAIRMENT IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL BALANCES, THE CORPORATION WILL RECORD A CHARGE TO EARNINGS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON NET INCOME, BUT NOT RISK BASED CAPITAL RATIOS.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "EMCLAIRE FINANCIAL CORP", "CIK": 858800, "Date": "2019-08-12T00:00:00", "Ticker": "EMCF", "Name": "Emclaire Financial Corp", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 6021.0, "Business": "PA", "Incorporated": "PA", "IRS": 251606091.0, "key": "20190812EMCF", "labelr1": 0.4951937081270076, "labelr2": -2.5507246376811668, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": -0.3569303985722708, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.6406074, "prof1": 0.35939258, "return1&2": 1.020428999016367, "return1&2&3": 1.020428999016367, "return1&2&3&4": 1.024071220309703, "return2": 1.0255072463768116, "return1": 0.99504806291873, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0035693039857227, "1_day_return": 0.4951937081270064, "cumulative_return1": 0.4238722394566369, "cumulative_return1&2": 1.5286138791554709, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 38.92169522452221, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1652.3438273067527, "indexx": 2177, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0315278285320604, "cumreturn1b": 0.9955358024913465, "cumreturndow": 0.9907772347757092, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9885827419161812}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2189, "level_0": 2245, "index": 48550, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION MAY CONTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANY, ITS BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES POSED BY MANY FACTORS AND EVENTS THAT COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY\u2019S ACTUAL BUSINESS, PROSPECTS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE THAT MAY BE ANTICIPATED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES MAY BE SUMMARIZED IN OTHER DOCUMENTS THAT THE COMPANY MAY FILE WITH THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION, SUCH AS OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REFLECT OUR VIEW ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT. THE COMPANY CANNOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS, LEVELS OF ACTIVITY, PERFORMANCE, OR ACHIEVEMENT. THE COMPANY DOES NOT UNDERTAKE ANY OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR CORRECT ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  THE COMPANY HAS LIMITED OPERATIONS AND IS ACTIVELY SEEKING A MERGER, REVERSE MERGER, ACQUISITION OR BUSINESS COMBINATION OPPORTUNITIES WITH AN OPERATING BUSINESS OR OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTION OPPORTUNITIES. UNTIL A TRANSACTION IS EFFECTUATED, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, DURING THIS PERIOD THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT TO ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT INCOME TO OFFSET THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING EXPENSES, RESULTING IN OPERATING LOSSES THAT MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO USE AND THEREBY REDUCE THE COMPANY\u2019S LIMITED CASH BALANCE. THE COMPANY\u2019S PREPAID EXPENSES DURING THE THREE-MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 INCREASED BY $9,000. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE PAYMENT OF THE OTCBB ANNUAL LISTING FEE IN THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. UNTIL THE COMPANY COMPLETES A MERGER, REVERSE MERGER OR OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTION, AND UNLESS INTEREST RATES INCREASE DRAMATICALLY, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO INCUR LOSSES BETWEEN $10,000 TO $12,000 PER QUARTER. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY ARRANGEMENTS WITH BANKS OR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING IN THE FUTURE.  THE PAYMENT OF ANY CASH DISTRIBUTIONS IS SUBJECT TO THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY HAS NO PLANS TO PAY ANY ADDITIONAL CASH DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  CURRENT BUSINESS  SINCE JUNE 2003, THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS CONSIST OF A SEARCH FOR A MERGER, ACQUISITION, REVERSE MERGER OR A BUSINESS TRANSACTION OPPORTUNITY WITH AN OPERATING BUSINESS OR OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTION; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS PLAN WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED. UNTIL A TRANSACTION IS EFFECTUATED, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY HAS NO ARRANGEMENTS OR UNDERSTANDINGS WITH RESPECT TO ANY POTENTIAL MERGER, ACQUISITION, REVERSE MERGER OR BUSINESS COMBINATION CANDIDATE PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY MAY BECOME AN OPERATING COMPANY.  OPPORTUNITIES MAY COME TO THE COMPANY\u2019S ATTENTION FROM VARIOUS SOURCES, INCLUDING OUR MANAGEMENT, OUR STOCKHOLDERS, PROFESSIONAL ADVISORS, SECURITIES BROKER DEALERS, VENTURE CAPITALISTS AND PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, MEMBERS OF THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY AND OTHERS WHO MAY PRESENT UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY HAS NO PLANS, UNDERSTANDINGS, AGREEMENTS, OR COMMITMENTS WITH ANY INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY TO ACT AS A FINDER IN REGARD TO ANY BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. WHILE IT IS NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED THAT THE COMPANY WILL ENGAGE UNAFFILIATED PROFESSIONAL FIRMS SPECIALIZING IN BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, REORGANIZATIONS OR OTHER SUCH TRANSACTIONS, SUCH FIRMS MAY BE RETAINED IF SUCH ARRANGEMENTS ARE DEEMED TO BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMPANY. COMPENSATION TO A FINDER OR BUSINESS ACQUISITION FIRM MAY TAKE VARIOUS FORMS, INCLUDING ONE-TIME CASH PAYMENTS, PAYMENTS INVOLVING ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES (INCLUDING THOSE OF THE COMPANY), OR ANY COMBINATION OF THESE OR OTHER COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY UNABLE TO PREDICT THE COST OF UTILIZING SUCH SERVICES.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT RESTRICTED ITS SEARCH TO ANY PARTICULAR BUSINESS, INDUSTRY, OR GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION. IN EVALUATING A POTENTIAL TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY ANALYZES ALL AVAILABLE FACTORS AND MAKE A DETERMINATION BASED ON A COMPOSITE OF AVAILABLE FACTS, WITHOUT RELIANCE ON ANY SINGLE FACTOR.  9  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO PREDICT THE NATURE OF A TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE COMPANY MAY PARTICIPATE. SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WOULD BE REVIEWED AS WELL AS THE RESPECTIVE NEEDS AND DESIRES OF THE COMPANY AND THE LEGAL STRUCTURE OR METHOD DEEMED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE SUITABLE WOULD BE SELECTED. IN IMPLEMENTING A STRUCTURE FOR A PARTICULAR TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY MAY BECOME A PARTY TO A MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, REORGANIZATION, TENDER OFFER, JOINT VENTURE, LICENSE, PURCHASE AND SALE OF ASSETS, OR PURCHASE AND SALE OF STOCK, OR OTHER ARRANGEMENT THE EXACT NATURE OF WHICH CANNOT NOW BE PREDICTED. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY MAY ACT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH AN INTEREST IN A PARTNERSHIP, CORPORATION OR OTHER FORM OF ORGANIZATION. IMPLEMENTING SUCH STRUCTURE MAY REQUIRE THE MERGER, CONSOLIDATION OR REORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY WITH OTHER BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WOULD BE THE SURVIVING ENTITY. IN ADDITION, OUR PRESENT MANAGEMENT AND STOCKHOLDERS MAY NOT HAVE CONTROL OF A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING SHARES OF THE COMPANY FOLLOWING REORGANIZATION OR OTHER FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. AS PART OF SUCH A TRANSACTION, SOME OR ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EXISTING DIRECTORS MAY RESIGN AND NEW DIRECTORS MAY BE APPOINTED. THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS FOLLOWING THE CONSUMMATION OF A TRANSACTION WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THE NATURE OF THE TRANSACTION. THERE MAY ALSO BE VARIOUS RISKS INHERENT IN THE TRANSACTION, THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF WHICH CANNOT BE PREDICTED.  THE COMPANY MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO INCREASED GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION FOLLOWING A TRANSACTION; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO PREDICT THE NATURE OR MAGNITUDE OF SUCH INCREASED REGULATION, IF ANY.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO INCUR MODERATE LOSSES EACH QUARTER UNTIL A TRANSACTION CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE BY MANAGEMENT IS EFFECTUATED.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD A LOSS FROM OPERATIONS OF $16,000. THE LOSS IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OPERATIONAL, ADMINISTRATIVE, AUDITING, TAX RETURN PREPARATION AND LEGAL EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE QUARTER. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, THE LOSS FROM OPERATIONS WAS $16,000. TAXES PAID IN THE QUARTERS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018 WERE $0 IN BOTH QUARTERS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WAS $99,000 AS COMPARED TO $115,000 AT MARCH 31, 2019. THE DECREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NET LOSS INCURRED DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $26,000 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $39,000 IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE $13,000 DECREASE IN CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN EXPENSES RELATED TO LEGAL AND OTHER OUTSIDE PROFESSIONALS.  CASH ON HAND AT JUNE 30, 2019 WAS $94,000 AS COMPARED TO $120,000 AT MARCH 31, 2019. THE DECREASE IN CASH ON HAND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ONGOING EXPENSES RELATED TO LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER OUTSIDE PROFESSIONALS.  THE COMPANY HAS NO MATERIAL OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS. THERE HAS BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGE IN ANY CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION AS SUMMARIZED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  10  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "FCCC INC", "CIK": 730669, "Date": "2019-08-13T00:00:00", "Ticker": "FCIC", "Name": "FCCC Inc", "Exchange": "OTC", "SIC": 6770.0, "Business": "CT", "Incorporated": "CT", "IRS": 60759497.0, "key": "20190813FCIC", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.60297596, "prof1": 0.39702395, "return1&2": 1.0, "return1&2&3": 1.0, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.3327327651357517, "cumulative_return1&2": 1.537266494305391, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 31.372081723517038, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1076.6594605172513, "indexx": 2189, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9820955668452566, "cumreturn1b": 0.9777112982624864, "cumreturndow": 0.9617546422813407, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9584703547083363}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2245, "level_0": 2303, "index": 74808, "text": "ITEM 2.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  ENERTECK CORPORATION (THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d OR \u201cENERTECK PARENT\u201d), FORMERLY NAMED GOLD BOND MINING COMPANY AND THEN GOLD BOND RESOURCES, INC., WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON ON JULY 30, 1935. WE ACQUIRED ENERTECK CHEMICAL CORP. (\u201cENERTECK SUB\u201d) AS A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY ON JANUARY 9, 2003. AS A RESULT OF THIS ACQUISITION, WE ARE NOW ACTING AS A HOLDING COMPANY, WITH ENERTECK SUB AS OUR PRIMARY OPERATING BUSINESS. SUBSEQUENT TO THIS TRANSACTION, ON NOVEMBER 24, 2003 WE CHANGED OUR DOMICILE FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON TO THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND CHANGED OUR NAME FROM GOLD BOND RESOURCES, INC. TO ENERTECK CORPORATION. UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES, THE TERMS \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cUS\u201d OR \u201cOUR\u201d REFER TO ENERTECK CORPORATION AND ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY.  ENERTECK SUB, OUR WHOLLY OWNED OPERATING SUBSIDIARY, WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF TEXAS ON NOVEMBER 29, 2000. IT WAS FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMMERCIALIZING A DIESEL FUEL SPECIFIC COMBUSTION CATALYST KNOWN AS ENERBURN (TM), AS WELL AS OTHER COMBUSTION ENHANCEMENT AND EMISSION REDUCTION TECHNOLOGIES. NALCO/EXXON ENERGY CHEMICALS, L.P. (\u201cNALCO/EXXON L.P.\u201d), A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN NALCO CHEMICAL CORPORATION AND EXXON CORPORATION COMMERCIALLY INTRODUCED ENERBURN IN 1998. WHEN NALCO/EXXON L.P. WENT THROUGH AN OWNERSHIP CHANGE IN 2000, OUR FOUNDER, DWAINE REESE, FORMED ENERTECK SUB. IT ACQUIRED THE ENERBURN TRADEMARK AND RELATED ASSETS AND TOOK OVER THE NALCO/EXXON L.P. RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ENERBURN BLENDER AT THAT TIME.  WE UTILIZE A SALES PROCESS THAT INCLUDES DETAILED PROPRIETARY CUSTOMER FLEET MONITORING PROTOCOLS IN ON-ROAD APPLICATIONS THAT QUANTIFY DATA AND ASSISTS IN MANAGING CERTAIN INTERNAL COMBUSTION DIESEL ENGINE OPERATING RESULTS WHILE UTILIZING ENERBURN. TEST DATA PREPARED BY SOUTHWEST RESEARCH INSTITUTE AND ACTUAL CUSTOMER USAGE HAS INDICATED THAT THE USE OF ENERBURN IN DIESEL ENGINES IMPROVES FUEL ECONOMY, LOWERS SMOKE, AND DECREASES ENGINE WEAR AND THE DANGEROUS EMISSIONS OF BOTH NITROGEN OXIDE (NOX) AND MICROSCOPIC AIRBORNE SOLID MATTER (PARTICULATES). OUR PRINCIPAL TARGET MARKETS HAVE INCLUDED THE TRUCKING, HEAVY CONSTRUCTION, MARITIME SHIPPING, RAILROAD AND MINING INDUSTRIES, AS WELL AS FEDERAL, STATE AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT APPLICATIONS. EACH OF THESE INDUSTRIES SHARES CERTAIN COMMON FINANCIAL CHARACTERISTICS, I.E. (I) DIESEL FUEL REPRESENTS A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF OPERATING COSTS; AND (II) RELATIVELY SMALL OPERATING MARGINS ARE PREVALENT. CONSIDERING THESE FACTORS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE USE OF ENERBURN AND THE CORRESPONDING DERIVED SAVINGS IN DIESEL FUEL COSTS CAN POSITIVELY AFFECT THE OPERATING MARGINS OF ITS CUSTOMERS WHILE CONTRIBUTING TO A CLEANER ENVIRONMENT.  DURING 2011, WE ACQUIRED A 40% MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN A ENTITY CALLED ENERTECK ENVIRONMENTAL, LLC, WHICH WAS FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKETING AND SELLING A DIESEL FUEL EMISSION REDUCTION TECHNOLOGY WITH THE CREATORS OF SUCH SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY.  14  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  REVENUES  WE RECOGNIZED REVENUES OF $9,037 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO REVENUES OF $10,427 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, A DECREASE OF $1,390. AS TESTING IS EITHER UNDERWAY OR COMPLETED WITH SEVERAL POTENTIAL NEW CUSTOMERS AND IN NEW AREAS WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE REMAINDER OF 2019 SHOULD SHOW IMPROVEMENT.  GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT, DEFINED AS REVENUES LESS COST OF GOODS SOLD, WAS $7,300, OR 80.8% OF REVENUE, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $8,461, OR 81.1% OF REVENUE, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THERE WILL BE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN GROSS PROFITS AS THE YEAR PROCEEDS, AS SEVERAL RECENTLY COMPLETED SUCCESSFUL TESTS HAVE REACHED THE NEGOTIATION STAGE AND OUR MANUFACTURING PROFICIENCY CONTINUES TO IMPROVE FOR OUR CORE PRODUCTS.  COST OF GOODS SOLD WAS $1,737 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WHICH REPRESENTED 19.2% OF REVENUE COMPARED TO $1,966 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, WHICH REPRESENTED 18.9% OR REVENUE.  COSTS AND EXPENSES  OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $290,669 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $214,861 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, AN INCREASE OF $75,808. COSTS AND EXPENSES IN ALL PERIODS PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF PAYROLL, PROFESSIONAL FEES, RENT EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION EXPENSE, AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND OTHER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PROFESSIONAL FEES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT.  NET LOSS  WE REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $340,757 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $274,778 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, AN INCREASE OF $65,979. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT SALES WILL INCREASE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF CERTAIN COMPLETED TESTING AND NEGOTIATIONS FOR AND WITH NEW CUSTOMERS.  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  REVENUES  WE RECOGNIZED REVENUES OF $25,710 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO REVENUES OF $22,346 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, AN INCREASE OF $3,364. AS TESTING IS EITHER UNDERWAY OR COMPLETED WITH SEVERAL POTENTIAL NEW CUSTOMERS AND IN NEW AREAS WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE REMAINDER OF 2019 SHOULD SHOW IMPROVEMENT.  GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT, DEFINED AS REVENUES LESS COST OF GOODS SOLD, WAS $20,763, OR 80.8% OF REVENUE, FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $17,587, OR 78.7% OF REVENUE, FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THERE WILL BE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN GROSS PROFITS AS THE YEAR PROCEEDS, AS SEVERAL RECENTLY COMPLETED SUCCESSFUL TESTS HAVE REACHED THE NEGOTIATION STAGE AND OUR MANUFACTURING PROFICIENCY CONTINUES TO IMPROVE FOR OUR CORE PRODUCTS.  COST OF GOODS SOLD WAS $4,947 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WHICH REPRESENTED 19.2% OF REVENUE COMPARED TO $4,759 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, WHICH REPRESENTED 21.3% OR REVENUE.  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COSTS AND EXPENSES  OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $569,685 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $418,916 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, AN INCREASE OF $150,769. COSTS AND EXPENSES IN ALL PERIODS PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF PAYROLL, PROFESSIONAL FEES, RENT EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION EXPENSE, AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND OTHER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PROFESSIONAL FEES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT.  NET LOSS  WE REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $661,417 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $512,282 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, AN INCREASE OF $149,135. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT SALES WILL INCREASE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF CERTAIN COMPLETED TESTING AND NEGOTIATIONS FOR AND WITH NEW CUSTOMERS.  OPERATIONS OUTLOOK  THE FUEL ADDITIVE INDUSTRY HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN MIRED BY A MYRIAD OF TECHNICALLY DUBIOUS PRODUCTS. PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS IN ALL TARGETED MARKET SECTORS AND GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS ARE PRIMARILY CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL BUSINESS RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADOPTION OF ANY NEW FUEL OR ENGINE TREATMENT. OUR SALES PROCESS BEGINS WITH A PROOF OF PERFORMANCE DEMONSTRATION THAT IS A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL CUSTOMER, INCLUDING FLEET TYPE, SIZE, AND OPPORTUNITY. THIS IS FOLLOWED WITH SALES PRESENTATIONS AT BOTH THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL AND MAINTENANCE LEVEL.  THE MAJORITY OF OUR MARKETING EFFORT SINCE 2005 HAS BEEN DIRECTED AT TARGETING AND GAINING A FOOTHOLD IN ONE OF SEVERAL MAJOR TARGET AREAS, INCLUDING THE INLAND MARINE DIESEL MARKET, TRUCKING, HEAVY CONSTRUCTION AND MINING. MANAGEMENT CONCEDES THAT SALES REVENUES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, THE CALENDAR YEAR 2018 AND PRIOR YEARS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN ANTICIPATED. ONE OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE FACED IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN THE VERY LONG TIMELINE FROM INITIAL CONTACT TO CONTRACT SIGNING SUBSEQUENT TO COMPLETION OF AN EVALUATION. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT MANY TIMES IN THE PAST, WE HAVE PROVEN THE BENEFITS OF ENERBURN, VARIOUS EVALUATING COMPANIES HAVE OPTED NOT TO MOVE FORWARD FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS WHICH WE BELIEVE WERE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  NEVERTHELESS, AT BOTH THE COMPANY AND DISTRIBUTOR LEVEL, WE HAVE RECENTLY COMPLETED OR ARE PROCEEDING WITH EVALUATIONS OF ENERBURN IN MANY FIELD TRIALS. AS WE CONTINUE TO STRING TOGETHER A SERIES OF POSITIVE EVALUATIONS IN MORE INDUSTRIES, WE SHOULD BEGIN TO SEE MORE BUSINESS GENERATED FROM SUCH RESULTS. NEW TRIALS ARE EITHER IN PROGRESS OR SHOULD BE COMMENCING SHORTLY.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  ON JUNE 30, 2019 WE HAD A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF $8,114,056 AND A STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 DEFICIT OF $7,926,333 COMPARED TO A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF $7,460,127 AND A STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 DEFICIT OF $7,264,916 ON DECEMBER 31, 2018. OUR CONTINUING DEFICIT LEVELS ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO POOR SALES. ON JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD $15,239 IN CASH, TOTAL ASSETS OF $318,469 AND TOTAL LIABILITIES OF $8,244,802, COMPARED TO $11,851 IN CASH, TOTAL ASSETS OF $318,444 AND TOTAL LIABILITIES OF $7,583,360 ON DECEMBER 31, 2018.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $314,932 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $394,102 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, A DECREASE OF $79,170. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $0 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018.  IN THE PAST, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS PRIMARILY FROM CAPITAL WHICH HAS BEEN RAISED. TO DATE, SALES HAVE NOT BEEN ADEQUATE TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS WITHOUT INVESTMENT CAPITAL. CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $318,320 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WITH $43,425 PROVIDED BY THE FINANCING OF PREPAID INSURANCE, REPAYMENTS ON THE FINANCING OF PREPAID INSURANCE OF $25,105 AND $300,000 FROM RELATED PARTY NOTES AND ADVANCES AS COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $406,100 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 WHICH WAS COMPRISED $355,000 OF RELATED PARTY NOTES AND ADVANCES AND $51,100 IN FINANCING OF PREPAID INSURANCE.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ANTICIPATE, BASED ON CURRENTLY PROPOSED PLANS AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO OUR OPERATIONS, THAT IN ADDITION TO OUR CURRENT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS TOGETHER WITH PROJECTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND PROJECTED REVENUES, WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT TO SATISFY OUR CONTEMPLATED CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE MADE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH INVESTMENT ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US OR AT ALL. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR COSTS AND EXPENSES OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $3.0 MILLION. OUR CONTINUATION AS A GOING CONCERN IS CONTINGENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING AND TO GENERATE REVENUES AND CASH FLOW TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS ON A TIMELY BASIS. AS MENTIONED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SALES REVENUES HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN EARLIER ANTICIPATED. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HAVE BEEN CORRECTED OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING CORRECTED AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT REOCCUR IN THE FUTURE AND THE GENERAL STATE OF THE ECONOMY. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THAT SALES SHOULD SHOW INCREASES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 AND INTO 2020. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE MADE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN REQUIRED FINANCIAL BACKING ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US OR AT ALL. OUR CONTEMPLATED CASH REQUIREMENTS BEYOND 2019 WILL DEPEND PRIMARILY UPON LEVEL OF SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS, INVENTORY LEVELS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING EXPENDITURES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  DUE TO OUR LACK OF MEANINGFUL REVENUES, WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS PRIMARILY FROM CAPITAL WHICH HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THIRD PARTIES AND PROMISSORY NOTES AND ADVANCES FROM RELATED PARTIES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, SUCH LOANS AND ADVANCES FROM RELATED PARTIES TOTAL $2,162,500 AS COMPARED TO $1,862,500 ON DECEMBER 31, 2018. MANY OF THESE REMAINING LOANS ARE PAST DUE AND CERTAIN OTHERS ARE DUE ON DEMAND. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT ANY OF SUCH RELATED PARTIES TO DEMAND PAYMENT UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO PAY BACK SUCH LOANS AND ADVANCES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH WILL BE THE CASE.

OVERVIEW  WE WERE INCORPORATED ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2010,  IN NEVADA. OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS THE ACQUISITION AND EXPLORATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES. WE HAVE NOT PRESENTLY DETERMINED WHETHER  THE PROPERTIES TO WHICH WE HAVE MINERAL RIGHTS CONTAIN MINERAL RESERVES THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY RECOVERABLE.  WE HAVE ONLY HAD LIMITED OPERATIONS TO  DATE AND WE RELY UPON THE SALE OF OUR SECURITIES AND BORROWINGS FROM OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT INVESTORS TO FUND  OUR OPERATIONS, AS WE HAVE NOT GENERATED ANY REVENUE.  IN AUGUST 2012, WE ENTERED INTO AN OPTION  AGREEMENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY PURCHASED THE \u201cSILVER DISTRICT\u201d PROJECT CONSISTING OF 85 UNPATENTED LODE MINING CLAIMS,  4 PATENTED LODE CLAIMS, A ARIZONA STATE EXPLORATION PERMIT OF 154.66 ACRES AND 23 UNPATENTED MILL SITE CLAIMS, TOTALING OVER 2,000  ACRES IN LA PAZ COUNTY, ARIZONA. SINCE OUR ACQUISITION, WE HAVE INCREASED OUR LAND POSITION IN THE SILVER DISTRICT BY STAKING TWO  UNPATENTED LODE MINING CLAIMS, LEASED TWO ADDITIONAL PATENTED CLAIMS AND HAVE INCREASED OUR ARIZONA STATE EXPLORATION PERMIT TO  334.85 ACRES.  ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2014, WE FORMED AND ORGANIZED  A NEW WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, GULF + WESTERN INDUSTRIES, INC., A NEVADA CORPORATION (\u201cGULF+WESTERN\u201d OR \u201cG+W\u201d),  TO OWN OUR SILVER DISTRICT MINING INTERESTS. ON OCTOBER 1, 2014 WE COMPLETED THE TRANSFER OF THOSE ASSETS FROM MAGELLAN TO G+W.  AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSFER, MAGELLAN OWNED ALL THE OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK OF G+W. EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2014, MAGELLAN PLEDGED  ALL ITS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN G+W TO MR. JOHN D. GIBBS, A SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER IN THE COMPANY, AS SECURITY FOR OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS  UNDER A LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT BETWEEN MAGELLAN AND MR. GIBBS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OWED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT  WAS $1,160,955, WHICH INCLUDES $869,550 OF PRINCIPAL AND $291,405 OF ACCRUED INTEREST.  ON OCTOBER 24, 2016, THE COMPANY ENTERED  INTO A MINING OPTION AGREEMENT (\u201cAGREEMENT\u201d) BETWEEN AND AMONG RIO SILVER INC., A CANADIAN COMPANY (\u201cRIO SILVER\u201d),  MINERA RIO PLATA S.A.C., A PERUVIAN COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY OF RIO SILVER (\u201cMINERA\u201d), AND MAGELLAN GOLD PERU S.A.C.,  A PERUVIAN COMPANY AND WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY (\u201cMAGELLAN PERU\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH RIO SILVER THROUGH  MINERA, GRANTED TO THE COMPANY THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE OPTION TO ACQUIRE AN UNDIVIDED 50% INTEREST IN AND TO PROPERTY LOCATED IN  CENTRAL PERU. EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2017, THE COMPANY AGREED WITH RIO SILVER TO TERMINATE THE OPTION AGREEMENT, THEREBY TERMINATING  THE COMPANY\u2019S OPTION TO EARN AN INTEREST IN THE NIN\u0303OBAMBA SILVER/GOLD PROJECT. THE COMPANY RETAINED ITS OWNERSHIP  OF RIO SILVER STOCK, WHICH HAVE BEEN PLEDGED TO SECURE A $125,000 LOAN FROM JOHN POWER.  20  ON NOVEMBER 30, 2017, THE COMPANY PURCHASED  FROM ROSE PETROLEUM PLC (\u201cROSE\u201d) A MINERAL PROCESSING MILL OPERATION LOCATED IN THE STATE OF NAVARIT, MEXICO (THE \u201cSDA  MILL\u201d) AS WELL AS ITS ASSOCIATED ASSETS, LICENSES AND AGREEMENTS. MAGELLAN PAID A $50,000 OPTION PAYMENT, AND AN ADDITIONAL  $100,000 OPTION-TO-PURCHASE EXTENSION. THE $100,000 OPTION EXTENSION PAYMENT WAS APPLIED AGAINST THE CASH PORTION OF THE PURCHASE  PRICE.  THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE SDA MILL CONSISTED  OF $850,000 CASH, A $50,000 PROMISSORY NOTE, THE $50,000 NON-REFUNDABLE OPTION PAYMENT, THE $100,000 FOR THE OPTION-TO-PURCHASE  PAYMENT, AND 284,017 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (THE \u201cSHARES\u201d) WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $426,025 AT THE CLOSING DATE. THE  NOTE IS NON-INTEREST BEARING AND WAS DUE ON MARCH 10, 2018 AND PAID IN APRIL 2018. THE SHARES WERE HELD IN ESCROW FOR A PERIOD  OF 12 MONTHS AND THE COMPANY HAD THE OPTION TO REPURCHASE THE SHARES FROM ROSE FOR THE SUM OF $500,000 IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS  AND $550,000 IN MONTHS 7 TO 12.  PRIOR TO CLOSING, ALL OF THE ASSETS AND  OPERATIONS RELATED TO THE SDA MILL WERE TRANSFERRED TO A NEWLY INCORPORATED ENTITY, MINERALES VANE 2 S.A. DE C.V. (\u201cMINERALES  VANE 2\u201d). EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 30, 2017, THE COMPANY\u2019S NEWLY INCORPORATED WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, MAGELLAN ACQUISITION  CORPORATION (\u201cMAC\u201d), ACQUIRED 100% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF MINERALES VANE 2.  ON OCTOBER 17, 2017, THE COMPANY AMENDED  THE AGREEMENT TO INCLUDE THE ACQUISITION OF MINERALES VANE OPERACIONES (\"MVO\") (THE ENTITY THAT PROVIDES LABOR TO THE  MILL) FOR $2,500. IN JANUARY 2018 THE COMPANY PAID THE PURCHASE PRICE AND OBTAINED LEGAL CONTROL OF MVO. MVO IS THE SISTER ENTITY  WHICH WAS ORGANIZED FOR THE PURPOSE OF EMPLOYING ALL PERSONNEL OF THE SDA MILL. THE ACQUISITION OF MVO WILL NOT RESULT IN THE ACQUISITION  OF ANY ADDITIONAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT  GIVING IT THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE THE EL DORADO GOLD-SILVER PROPERTY, A 50 HECTARE MINING CONCESSION LOCATED NEAR THE VILLAGE OF  LAS MINITAS, WHICH LIES 50 KILOMETERS SOUTH OF MAGELLAN\u2019S SDA FLOTATION PLANT AT ACAPONETA, NAYARIT STATE. MAGELLAN INTENDS  TO ADVANCE EL DORADO TOWARDS PRODUCTION AS A MATTER OF PRIORITY. THE PROJECT HAS EXCELLENT ROAD AND RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE  COMPANY PLANS TO TRUCK THE ORE FROM EL DORADO TO THE SDA PLANT FOR PROCESSING. EL DORADO IS SITUATED WITHIN A DISTRICT OF EPITHERMAL  VEIN SYSTEMS FROM WHICH HISTORIC MINING PRODUCED HIGH GRADES.  COMMENCEMENT OF MINING WILL DEPEND ON A  NUMBER OF PRECONDITIONS, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH INCLUDE OBTAINING ENVIRONMENTAL AND BLASTING PERMITS, SELECTING AND MOBILIZING  A MINING CONTRACTOR AND PROCURING FINANCING. AN ACCESS AND LAND USE AGREEMENT WITH THE LOCAL EJIDO ALREADY IS IN PLACE. ONCE DEVELOPMENT  BEGINS, ORE WILL BE ACCESSIBLE WITH A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF UNDERGROUND DEVELOPMENT. ORE WILL BE SOURCED INITIALLY FROM THE SHALLOW,  UPPER PORTIONS OF THE MINERALIZED VEINS.  DRILLING ON THE EL DORADO VEIN SYSTEM WAS  CONDUCTED BY A TSX.V-LISTED COMPANY IN 2010-2011 AND COMPRISED 28 DIAMOND CORE HOLES TOTALING 4,950 METERS. TWO VEINS APPEAR TO  OFFER PARTICULAR PROMISE FOR MINING, NAMELY THE HUNDIDO AND INTERMEDIA VEINS. THESE VEINS LIE ADJACENT TO AND ALONG STRIKE FROM  THE OLD HUNDIDO MINE, WHICH FROM 1900-1927 PRODUCED AN ESTIMATED 50,000 TONNES OF HIGH-GRADE GOLD-SILVER ORE. THE VEINS ARE STEEPLY-DIPPING,  HIGHLY SILICIFIED STRUCTURES CUTTING VOLCANIC ROCKS. POLYGONAL RESOURCE CALCULATIONS FOR THE TWO VEINS, BASED ON INTERSECTIONS  IN 10 CORE HOLES AND AFTER APPLYING A 25% TONNAGE DEDUCTION FOR DILUTION AND RECOVERY FACTORS, YIELDED RESPECTIVELY 89,000 TONNES  GRADING 7.01 G/T GOLD EQUIVALENT (AU+AG) OVER A TRUE WIDTH OF 2.3 METERS (HUNDIDO VEIN); AND 91,000 TONNES GRADING 15.17 G/T GOLD  EQUIVALENT (AU+AG) OVER A TRUE WIDTH OF 8.3 METERS (INTERMEDIA VEIN). THESE RESOURCES ARE NON-NI43-101 COMPLIANT. THE MINERALIZATION  EXTENDS FROM NEAR SURFACE TO A DRILLED DEPTH OF 150 METERS AND IS OPEN AT GREATER DEPTH.  THE EL DORADO VEIN SYSTEM CAN BE TRACED  ON THE SURFACE FOR A DISTANCE GREATER THAN THREE KILOMETERS AND EXHIBITS STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY WITH NUMEROUS CONJUGATE VEIN SPLITS  BOTH IN THE HANGINGWALL AND FOOTWALL. THIS COMPLEX STRUCTURE HOSTS MULTIPLE MINERALIZED ZONES INCLUDING HIGH-GRADE VEINS POTENTIALLY  MINABLE UNDERGROUND, AND LOWER-GRADE OPEN-PITTABLE STOCKWORK ZONES THAT ARE OBSERVED TO EXTEND OVER TENS OF METERS IN WIDTH IN  BOTH THE HANGINGWALL AND FOOTWALL OF THE EL DORADO VEIN SYSTEM.  21  MAGELLAN HAS CONCLUDED AN AGREEMENT WITH  INGENIEROS MINEROS, S.A. DE C.V., THE OWNER OF THE EL DORADO MINING CONCESSION GIVING THE COMPANY THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE THE CONCESSION  BY MAKING STAGED SIX-MONTHLY OPTION PAYMENTS OVER TWO YEARS TOWARDS AN END PURCHASE PRICE OF $800,000 (PLUS 16% IVA). NO ROYALTIES  ARE PAYABLE. MAGELLAN HAS THE RIGHT TO BEGIN PRODUCTION DURING THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY HAS MADE THE INITIAL OPTION  PAYMENT OF $50,000 (PLUS 16% IVA) PLUS AN ADDITIONAL $50,000 DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. IN ADDITION, MAGELLAN  HAS AGREED WITH A TSX.V-LISTED COMPANY TO PURCHASE A COMPREHENSIVE EL DORADO DATA PACKAGE INCLUDING DIAMOND DRILL CORE AND TECHNICAL  INFORMATION FOR A PRICE OF $120,000, PAYABLE IN CASH AND MAGELLAN COMMON STOCK.  OUR PRIMARY FOCUS WITH THE ACQUISITION  OF THE SDA MILL IN MEXICO IS TO TRANSFORM MAGELLAN INTO A PRODUCTION COMPANY, TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE OUR ARIZONA SILVER PROJECT  TOWARDS RESOURCE DEFINITION AND EVENTUAL DEVELOPMENT, AND POSSIBLY TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL MINERAL RIGHTS AND CONDUCT ADDITIONAL  EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT AND PERMITTING ACTIVITIES. OUR MINERAL LEASE PAYMENTS, PERMITTING APPLICATIONS AND EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT  EFFORTS WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. WE RELY UPON THE SALE OF OUR SECURITIES AS WELL AS ADVANCES AND LOANS FROM EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT  AND SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDERS TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AS WE HAVE NOT GENERATED ANY SIGNIFICANT REVENUE.

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED  IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d).  USE OF ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GAAP REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED  AMOUNTS OF EXPENSES DURING THE PERIOD PRESENTED.  WE MAKE OUR ESTIMATE OF THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME  FOR THESE ITEMS BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS AND OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE WHEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED. CHANGES  IN ESTIMATES ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING RULES FOR THE ESTIMATE, WHICH IS TYPICALLY IN THE PERIOD WHEN NEW  INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS ARE REASONABLE, BASED UPON  INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME THEY WERE MADE. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES, MAKING IT POSSIBLE THAT A CHANGE  IN THESE ESTIMATES COULD OCCUR IN THE NEAR TERM.  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS  THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ITS ACCOUNTING RECORDS  IN US DOLLARS. OUR OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, MINERALES VANE 2, S.A. DE C.V., AND MINERALES VANE OPERACIONES, S.A DE C.V., REPORT  IN MEXICAN PESOS WHICH IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR BOTH ENTITIES. THE SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED IN THEIR  RESPECTIVE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES AND ARE REPORTED TO THE COMPANY IN MEXICAN PESOS. FOR REPORTING, THE COMPANY TRANSLATES THE SUBSIDIARIES\u2019  TRANSACTIONS AND ACCOUNTS TO US DOLLARS AT EXCHANGE RATES APPROXIMATING THOSE RULING AT THE TRANSACTION DATES. EXCHANGE GAINS AND  LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN THE STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES  ARE TRANSLATED INTO THE U.S. DOLLARS AT EXCHANGE RATES AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE, EQUITY ACCOUNTS ARE TRANSLATED AT HISTORICAL  EXCHANGE RATE AND REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED BY USING THE AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED  AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  WE VALUE OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  USING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED  LIABILITIES, AMOUNTS DUE TO RELATED PARTIES AND NOTES PAYABLE TO RELATED PARTIES. FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE  RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT  DATE. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED LIABILITIES, NOTES PAYABLE TO RELATED PARTIES  AND OTHER AMOUNTS DUE TO RELATED PARTIES APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  26  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK  OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WHICH POTENTIALLY  SUBJECT US TO CREDIT RISK ARE OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. WE MAINTAIN OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT REPUTABLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  AND CURRENTLY, WE ARE NOT EXPOSED TO SIGNIFICANT CREDIT RISK.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  WE CONSIDER ALL AMOUNTS ON DEPOSIT WITH  FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS AT  THE DATE OF PURCHASE.  MINERAL RIGHTS  WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT OUR MINERAL RIGHTS  MEET THE DEFINITION OF MINERAL RIGHTS, AS DEFINED BY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, AND ARE TANGIBLE ASSETS. AS A RESULT, OUR DIRECT COSTS  TO ACQUIRE OR LEASE MINERAL RIGHTS ARE INITIALLY CAPITALIZED AS TANGIBLE ASSETS. MINERAL RIGHTS INCLUDE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH.  LEASING OR ACQUIRING PATENTED AND UNPATENTED MINING CLAIMS; LEASING MINING RIGHTS INCLUDING LEASE SIGNATURE BONUSES, LEASE RENTAL  PAYMENTS AND ADVANCE MINIMUM ROYALTY PAYMENTS; AND OPTIONS TO PURCHASE OR LEASE MINERAL PROPERTIES.  IF WE ESTABLISH PROVEN AND PROBABLE RESERVES  FOR A MINERAL PROPERTY AND ESTABLISH THAT THE MINERAL PROPERTY CAN BE ECONOMICALLY DEVELOPED, MINERAL RIGHTS WILL BE AMORTIZED  OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE PROPERTY FOLLOWING THE COMMENCEMENT OF COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION OR EXPENSED IF IT IS DETERMINED  THAT THE MINERAL PROPERTY HAS NO FUTURE ECONOMIC VALUE OR IF THE PROPERTY IS SOLD OR ABANDONED. FOR MINERAL RIGHTS IN WHICH PROVEN  AND PROBABLE RESERVES HAVE NOT YET BEEN ESTABLISHED, WE ASSESS THE CARRYING VALUES FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING  PERIOD AND WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  THE NET CARRYING VALUE OF OUR MINERAL RIGHTS  REPRESENTS THE FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME THE MINERAL RIGHTS WERE ACQUIRED LESS ACCUMULATED DEPLETION AND ANY ABANDONMENT OR IMPAIRMENT  LOSSES. PROVEN AND PROBABLE RESERVES HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR MINERAL RIGHTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2019. AT JUNE 30, 2019, MINERAL  RIGHTS TOTALING $99,405 WERE NET OF $441,057 OF CUMULATIVE IMPAIRMENT AND ABANDONMENT CHARGES. NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE RECOGNIZED  FOR EITHER OF THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 OR 2018.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND MINING RIGHTS  WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR EVENTS AND CHANGES  IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COULD INDICATE THAT OUR CARRYING AMOUNTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING MINERAL RIGHTS, MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  WHEN SUCH EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR, WE ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS BY DETERMINING WHETHER THE  CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS WILL BE RECOVERED THROUGH THEIR UNDISCOUNTED EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOW. IF THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED  CASH FLOW IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE ASSETS, WE RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING  AMOUNT OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS.  NOTES PAYABLE \u2013 RELATED PARTIES  NOTES PAYABLE TO RELATED PARTIES ARE CLASSIFIED  AS CURRENT LIABILITIES AS THE NOTE HOLDERS EITHER HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE REPAYMENT DATES OF THE NOTES OR THE NOTES ARE  DUE WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE.  EXPLORATION COSTS  MINERAL EXPLORATION COSTS ARE EXPENSED  AS INCURRED. WHEN IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT IT IS ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE TO EXTRACT MINERALS AND THE PERMITTING PROCESS HAS BEEN  INITIATED, EXPLORATION COSTS INCURRED TO FURTHER DELINEATE AND DEVELOP THE PROPERTY ARE CONSIDERED PRE-COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION COSTS  AND WILL BE CAPITALIZED AND INCLUDED AS MINE DEVELOPMENT COSTS IN OUR BALANCE SHEETS.  27  INCOME TAXES  WE RECOGNIZE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  FOR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE AMOUNTS AT WHICH THEY ARE CARRIED IN THE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS AND THE EFFECT OF NET OPERATING LOSSES BASED UPON THE ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR THE YEAR IN WHICH THE DIFFERENCES  ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED WHEN NECESSARY TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT EXPECTED  TO BE REALIZED. AT JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD NO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.  NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE  WE COMPUTE BASIC NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE  BY DIVIDING OUR NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY OUR WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING  THE PERIOD. COMPUTATION OF DILUTED NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE ADDS THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING  TO THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING, AS CALCULATED FOR BASIC NET LOSS PER SHARE, EXCEPT FOR INSTANCES IN WHICH THERE  IS A NET LOSS. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES ASSOCIATED WITH CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE  AND OUTSTANDING WARRANTS TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK HAVE BEEN OMITTED FROM THE NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE COMPUTATION AS THEY ARE  ANTI-DILUTIVE DUE TO THE NET LOSS FOR THESE PERIODS.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  THE COMPANY MEASURES THE COST OF EMPLOYEE  SERVICES RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN AWARD OF EQUITY INSTRUMENTS (SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS, OR SBP) BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE  OF THE AWARD. THAT COST IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE PERIOD DURING WHICH AN EMPLOYEE IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SERVICE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE  SBP AWARD\u2014THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD (VESTING PERIOD). FOR SBP AWARDS SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS, COMPENSATION IS NOT RECOGNIZED  UNTIL THE PERFORMANCE CONDITION IS PROBABLE OF OCCURRENCE. THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF SHARE OPTIONS IS ESTIMATED USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON  OPTION-PRICING MODEL. THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2018-07 ON JANUARY 1, 2019 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD, WHICH ALIGNS  THE ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES AND NONEMPLOYEES.  RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO.  2016-02, LEASES (TOPIC 842) (ASU 2016-02). UNDER ASU NO. 2016-2, AN ENTITY IS REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE  LIABILITIES ON ITS BALANCE SHEET AND DISCLOSE KEY INFORMATION ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. ASU NO. 2016-02 OFFERS SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING  GUIDANCE FOR A LESSEE, A LESSOR AND SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS. LESSEES AND LESSORS ARE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE QUALITATIVE AND  QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS TO ENABLE A USER OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO ASSESS THE AMOUNT, TIMING AND  UNCERTAINTY OF CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM LEASES. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS STANDARD ON JANUARY 1, 2019 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE  METHOD. THE NEW STANDARD PROVIDES A NUMBER OF OPTIONAL PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS IN TRANSITION. THE COMPANY ELECTED THE \u2018PACKAGE  OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS\u2019, WHICH PERMITTED THE COMPANY NOT TO REASSESS UNDER THE NEW STANDARD ITS PRIOR CONCLUSIONS ABOUT  LEASE IDENTIFICATION, LEASE CLASSIFICATION AND INITIAL DIRECT COSTS; AND ALL OF THE NEW STANDARD\u2019S AVAILABLE TRANSITION PRACTICAL  EXPEDIENTS.  ON ADOPTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED ADDITIONAL  OPERATING LIABILITIES OF $6,968, WITH CORRESPONDING RIGHT OF USE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AMOUNT BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE  OF THE REMAINING MINIMUM RENTAL PAYMENTS UNDER CURRENT LEASING STANDARDS FOR ITS EXISTING OPERATING LEASES.  THE NEW STANDARD ALSO PROVIDES PRACTICAL  EXPEDIENTS FOR A COMPANY\u2019S ONGOING ACCOUNTING. THE COMPANY ELECTED THE SHORT-TERM LEASE RECOGNITION EXEMPTION FOR ITS LEASES.  FOR THOSE LEASES WITH A LEASE TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS, THE COMPANY WILL NOT RECOGNIZE ROU ASSETS OR LEASE LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY  ALSO MADE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO COMBINE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS OF OPERATING LEASES FOR ALL ASSET CLASSES.  28", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "MAGELLAN GOLD Corp", "CIK": 1515317, "Date": "2019-08-15T00:00:00", "Ticker": "MAGE", "Name": "Magellan Gold Corp", "Exchange": "OTCBB", "SIC": 1000.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "NV", "IRS": 273566922.0, "key": "20190815MAGE", "labelr1": 0.42372881355933184, "labelr2": 0.4219409282700332, "labelr3": 2.9411764705882475, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.61541766, "prof1": 0.38458237, "return1&2": 0.9915611814345991, "return1&2&3": 0.962397617274758, "return1&2&3&4": 0.962397617274758, "return2": 0.9957805907172996, "return1": 0.9957627118644068, "return3": 0.9705882352941176, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 0.4237288135593209, "cumulative_return1": 0.5940853208892786, "cumulative_return1&2": 4.297134488521744, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 32.913549133034266, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 565.4770765499384, "indexx": 2307, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9921200328826205, "cumreturn1b": 0.9610595431438644, "cumreturndow": 0.9780332460813522, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9737652206508297}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2311, "level_0": 2370, "index": 87037, "text": "ITEM 2  \u2013 MANAGEMENT\u2019S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS  QUARTERLY R  EPORT ON FORM 10-Q  .

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT DEVELOPS AND COMMERCIALIZES PRODUCTS MADE FROM AMORPHOUS ALLOYS. OUR LIQUIDMETAL\u00ae FAMILY OF ALLOYS CONSISTS OF A VARIETY OF PROPRIETARY BULK ALLOYS AND COMPOSITES THAT UTILIZE THE ADVANTAGES OFFERED BY AMORPHOUS ALLOY TECHNOLOGY. WE DESIGN, DEVELOP AND SELL CUSTOM PRODUCTS AND PARTS FROM BULK AMORPHOUS ALLOYS TO CUSTOMERS IN VARIOUS INDUSTRIES. WE ALSO PARTNER WITH THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS AND LICENSEES TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE LIQUIDMETAL ALLOY PRODUCTS.  AMORPHOUS ALLOYS ARE, IN GENERAL, UNIQUE MATERIALS THAT ARE DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR ABILITY TO RETAIN A RANDOM ATOMIC STRUCTURE WHEN THEY SOLIDIFY, IN CONTRAST TO THE CRYSTALLINE ATOMIC STRUCTURE THAT FORMS IN OTHER METALS AND ALLOYS WHEN THEY SOLIDIFY. LIQUIDMETAL ALLOYS ARE PROPRIETARY AMORPHOUS ALLOYS THAT POSSESS A COMBINATION OF PERFORMANCE, PROCESSING, AND POTENTIAL COST ADVANTAGES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL MAKE THEM PREFERABLE TO OTHER MATERIALS IN A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS. THE AMORPHOUS ATOMIC STRUCTURE OF BULK ALLOYS ENABLES THEM TO OVERCOME CERTAIN PERFORMANCE LIMITATIONS CAUSED BY INHERENT WEAKNESSES IN CRYSTALLINE ATOMIC STRUCTURES, THUS FACILITATING PERFORMANCE AND PROCESSING CHARACTERISTICS SUPERIOR IN MANY WAYS TO THOSE OF THEIR CRYSTALLINE COUNTERPARTS. WE BELIEVE OUR ALLOYS AND THE MOLDING TECHNOLOGIES WE EMPLOY CAN RESULT IN COMPONENTS FOR MANY APPLICATIONS THAT EXHIBIT EXCEPTIONAL DIMENSIONAL CONTROL AND REPEATABILITY THAT RIVALS PRECISION MACHINING, EXCELLENT CORROSION RESISTANCE, BRILLIANT SURFACE FINISH, HIGH STRENGTH, HIGH HARDNESS, HIGH ELASTIC LIMIT, ALLOYS THAT ARE NON-MAGNETIC, AND THE ABILITY TO FORM COMPLEX SHAPES COMMON TO THE INJECTION MOLDING OF PLASTICS. ALL OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE ACHIEVABLE FROM THE MOLDING PROCESS, SO DESIGN ENGINEERS OFTEN DO NOT HAVE TO SELECT SPECIFIC ALLOYS TO ACHIEVE ONE OR MORE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS AS IS THE CASE WITH CRYSTALLINE MATERIALS. WE BELIEVE THESE ADVANTAGES COULD RESULT IN LIQUIDMETAL ALLOYS SUPPLANTING HIGH-PERFORMANCE ALLOYS, SUCH AS TITANIUM AND STAINLESS STEEL, AND OTHER INCUMBENT MATERIALS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS. MOREOVER, WE BELIEVE THESE ADVANTAGES COULD ENABLE THE INTRODUCTION OF ENTIRELY NEW PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS THAT ARE NOT POSSIBLE OR COMMERCIALLY VIABLE WITH OTHER MATERIALS.  OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM I) SELLING OUR BULK AMORPHOUS ALLOY CUSTOM PRODUCTS AND PARTS FOR APPLICATIONS WHICH INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, NON-CONSUMER ELECTRONIC DEVICES, MEDICAL PRODUCTS, AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS, AND SPORTS AND LEISURE GOODS; II) SELLING TOOLING AND PROTOTYPE PARTS SUCH AS DEMONSTRATION PARTS AND TEST SAMPLES FOR CUSTOMERS WITH PRODUCTS IN DEVELOPMENT; AND III) PRODUCT LICENSING AND ROYALTY REVENUE. WE EXPECT THAT THESE SOURCES OF REVENUE WILL CONTINUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF OUR REVENUE MIX AS OPERATIONS ARE SCALED.  OUR COST OF SALES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THE COSTS OF MANUFACTURING, WHICH INCLUDE RAW ALLOY AND INTERNAL LABOR REQUIRED TO OPERATE OUR ON-SITE PRODUCTION CELLS. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CURRENTLY CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND RELATED BENEFITS, TRAVEL, CONSULTING AND PROFESSIONAL FEES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, INSURANCE, OFFICE AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES REPRESENT SALARIES, RELATED BENEFITS EXPENSES, CONSULTING AND CONTRACT SERVICES, EXPENSES INCURRED FOR THE DESIGN AND TESTING OF NEW PROCESSING METHODS, EXPENSES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SAMPLE AND PROTOTYPE PRODUCTS, AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF LIQUIDMETAL BULK ALLOYS. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. WE PLAN TO ENHANCE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION BY IMPROVING OUR EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES AND DEVELOPING ADVANCES IN AMORPHOUS ALLOY TECHNOLOGIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WILL FOCUS ON THE DISCOVERY OF NEW ALLOY COMPOSITIONS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF IMPROVED PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF NEW APPLICATIONS FOR OUR ALLOYS.  IN JULY 2019, THE COMPANY ADOPTED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY ELECTED TO WIND DOWN ITS PRIOR MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AT THE COMPANY\u2019S LAKE FOREST, CA FACILITY AND SEEK TO OUTSOURCE THE MANUFACTURE OF PARTS UTILIZING THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY THROUGH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING PARTNERS (THE \u201cJULY 2019 RESTRUCTURING PLAN\u201d).   IN CONNECTION WITH THE JULY 2019 RESTRUCTURING PLAN, THE COMPANY HAS SHIFTED ITS BUSINESS STRATEGY FROM INTERNAL MANUFACTURE OF PARTS AND PRODUCTS FOR CUSTOMERS TOWARD THE USE AND RELIANCE OF OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURERS, WHICH WILL INITIALLY BE DONGGUAN YIHAO METALS MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. (\u201cYIHAO\u201d), A CHINA-BASED COMPANY THAT IS AN AFFILIATE OF OUR LARGEST BENEFICIAL STOCKHOLDER OUR CEO AND CHAIRMAN, PROFESSOR LUGEE LI.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LICENSING TRANSACTIONS  EONTEC LICENSE AGREEMENT  ON MARCH 10, 2016, IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2016 PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE ENTERED INTO A PARALLEL LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cLICENSE AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH DONGGUAN EONTEC CO., LTD., A HONG KONG CORPORATION (\u201cEONTEC\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH WE EACH ENTERED INTO A CROSS-LICENSE OF OUR RESPECTIVE TECHNOLOGIES.

SUBSEQUENTLY, THIS OBLIGATION WAS EXTENDED TO APPLY TO ALL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED THROUGH FEBRUARY 2016. WE ARE ALSO OBLIGATED TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY FORMALITIES WITH RESPECT TO CIP AT ALL TIMES AFTER THE CLOSING OF THE LICENSE TRANSACTION.  VISSER PRECISION CAST, LLC LICENSE AGREEMENT  ON JUNE 1, 2012, WE ENTERED INTO A MASTER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT (THE \u201cVISSER MTA\u201d) WITH VISSER PRECISION CAST, LLC (\u201cVISSER\u201d) RELATING TO A STRATEGIC TRANSACTION FOR MANUFACTURING SERVICES AND FINANCING. ON MAY 20, 2014, WE AND VISSER ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDING THE VISSER MTA, WHEREBY WE GRANTED TO VISSER A FULLY PAID-UP, ROYALTY-FREE, IRREVOCABLE, PERPETUAL, WORLDWIDE, NON-TRANSFERABLE, NONEXCLUSIVE SUBLICENSE TO ALL OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED ON OR PRIOR TO MAY 20, 2014 (THE \u201cEFFECTIVE DATE\u201d).

IN MARCH 2011, THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT WAS AMENDED TO GRANT SWATCH EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS AS TO WATCHES AND ALL THIRD PARTIES (INCLUDING US), BUT NON-EXCLUSIVE AS TO APPLE, AND OUR LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH LLPG WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY AMENDED TO EXCLUDE WATCHES FROM LLPG\u2019S RIGHTS. WE WILL RECEIVE ROYALTY PAYMENTS OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT ON ALL LIQUIDMETAL PRODUCTS PRODUCED AND SOLD BY SWATCH. THE LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH SWATCH WILL EXPIRE ON THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE LAST LICENSED PATENT.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED TO $132 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $55 THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED TO $355 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $135 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER VOLUMES ASSOCIATED WITH EARLY-PRODUCTION ORDERS AND CONTINUED PROTOTYPING PROJECTS IN AN EFFORT TO BUILD A SIGNIFICANT, RECURRING, FUNNEL OF PRODUCTION BUSINESS DURING THE 2019 PERIOD AND PROSPECTIVELY.  COST OF  SALES  . COST OF SALES WAS $103, OR 78% OF PRODUCTS REVENUE, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, AN INCREASE FROM $61, OR 111% OF PRODUCTS REVENUE, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. COST OF SALES WAS $282, OR 79% OF PRODUCTS REVENUE, FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AN INCREASE FROM $142, OR 105% OF PRODUCTS REVENUE, FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  THE DECREASE IN OUR COST OF SALES AS A PERCENTAGE OF PRODUCTS REVENUE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER RAW MATERIAL COSTS AS A RESULT OF MARKET ADJUSTMENTS TAKEN DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PRODUCTION THROUGHPUT. WHEN WE BEGIN INCREASING OUR PRODUCTS REVENUES WITH SHIPMENTS OF ROUTINE, COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AND PARTS THROUGH OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND, IN FUTURE PERIODS, THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, WE EXPECT OUR COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES TO DECREASE, STABILIZE AND BE MORE PREDICTABLE.  GROSS  PROFIT  (  LOS  S)  . OUR GROSS PROFIT INCREASED TO $29 FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $(6) FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. OUR GROSS PROFIT (LOSS) AS A PERCENTAGE OF PRODUCTS REVENUE, INCREASED TO 22% FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM (11)% FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. OUR GROSS PROFIT (LOSS) INCREASED TO $73 FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $(7) FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. OUR GROSS PROFIT (LOSS), AS A PERCENTAGE OF PRODUCTS REVENUE, INCREASED TO 21% FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM (5)% FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  EARLY PROTOTYPE AND PRE-PRODUCTION ORDERS GENERALLY RESULT IN A HIGHER COST MIX, RELATIVE TO REVENUE, THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE INCURRED IN AN ON-SITE PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT, WITH HIGHER VOLUMES AND MORE ESTABLISHED OPERATING PROCESSES, OR THROUGH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS. AS SUCH, OUR GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGES HAVE FLUCTUATED AND MAY CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE BASED ON VOLUME AND QUOTED PRODUCTION PRICES PER UNIT AND MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR FUTURE BUSINESS. WHEN WE BEGIN INCREASING OUR PRODUCTS REVENUES WITH SHIPMENTS OF ROUTINE, COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AND PARTS THROUGH FUTURE ORDERS TO OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND, IN FUTURE PERIODS, THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, WE EXPECT OUR GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGES TO STABILIZE, INCREASE, AND BE MORE PREDICTABLE.  SELLING, MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  . SELLING, MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $1,275 AND $2,708 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO $1,527 AND $3,112 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN EXPENSES WAS DUE TO OVERALL LOWER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AS A RESULT OF PRIOR PERIOD HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  . RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE $406 AND $895 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO $644 AND $1,254 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE IN EXPENSE WAS MAINLY DUE TO REDUCTION IN MOLD, TOOLING, AND ALLOY DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES. WE CONTINUE TO (I) PERFORM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LIQUIDMETAL ALLOYS AND RELATED PROCESSING CAPABILITIES, (II) DEVELOP NEW MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES, AND (III) CONTRACT WITH CONSULTANTS TO ADVANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIQUIDMETAL ALLOYS AND RELATED PRODUCTION PROCESSES.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE JULY 2019 RESTRUCTURING PLAN, NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $1,676 WERE RECORDED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS A RESULT OF CHANGED ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE ASSET GROUPING AND FUTURE USE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING ASSETS. SIMILAR CHARGES WERE NOT RECORDED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  OPERATING LOSS  . OPERATING LOSS WAS $3,333 AND $5,211 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THIS COMPARES TO $2,177 AND $4,373 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS PERIODS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING LOSS ARE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO VARIATIONS IN OPERATING EXPENSES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  AS A RESULT OF THE JULY 2019 RESTRUCTURING PLAN, WE ANTICIPATE THAT ON-GOING OPERATING SELLING, MARKETING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND RESEARCH AN DEVELOPMENT WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED, PRIMARILY THROUGH EMPLOYEE HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS AND THE OUTSOURCING OF DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE TO EXPEDITE THE ADOPTION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY, BUT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED LONG SALES LEAD TIMES FOR CUSTOMER ADOPTION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY. UNTIL THAT TIME WHEN WE CAN EITHER (I) INCREASE OUR REVENUES WITH SHIPMENTS OF ROUTINE, COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS AND PARTS THROUGH THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR (II) OBTAIN SIGNIFICANT LICENSING REVENUES, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  OTHER INCOME AND  EXPENSE  S  INTEREST INCOME.  INTEREST INCOME RELATES TO INTEREST EARNED FROM OUR CASH DEPOSITS FOR THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS. SUCH AMOUNTS WERE $109 AND $219 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THIS COMPARES TO $35 AND $68 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $2,456 AND $3,383 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE CASH WAS PRIMARILY USED TO FUND OPERATING EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.  CASH  USED IN  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $592 AND $71 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. INVESTING OUTFLOWS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT AND BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE WILL SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASE BASED ON THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED SHIFT IN OUR MANUFACTURING STRATEGY.  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $14 AND $47 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IS COMPRISED OF CASH RECEIVED FOR THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES FOLLOWING THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND OUTLOOK  DURING 2016, WE RAISED A TOTAL OF $62,700 THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF 405,000,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN MULTIPLE CLOSINGS UNDER THE 2016 PURCHASE AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY HAS A RELATIVELY LIMITED HISTORY OF PRODUCING BULK AMORPHOUS ALLOY PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS ON A MASS-PRODUCTION SCALE. FURTHERMORE, THE ABILITY OF FUTURE CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS IN DESIRED QUANTITIES AND AT COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE PRICES IS UNCERTAIN AND IS DEPENDENT ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL, INCLUDING THE NATURE AND DESIGN OF THE COMPONENT, THE CUSTOMER\u2019S SPECIFICATIONS, AND REQUIRED DELIVERY TIMELINES. THESE FACTORS HAVE PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED THAT THE COMPANY ENGAGE IN EQUITY SALES UNDER VARIOUS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENTS TO SUPPORT ITS OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. AS A RESULT OF THE FUNDING UNDER THE 2016 PURCHASE AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ITS CURRENT CAPITAL RESOURCES, WHEN CONSIDERING EXPECTED LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "LIQUIDMETAL TECHNOLOGIES INC", "CIK": 1141240, "Date": "2019-08-16T00:00:00", "Ticker": "LQMT", "Name": "Liquidmetal Technologies Inc", "Exchange": "OTCBB", "SIC": 2800.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 330264467.0, "key": "20190816LQMT", "labelr1": 11.11111111111112, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5972182, "prof1": 0.40278175, "return1&2": 0.8888888888888888, "return1&2&3": 0.8888888888888888, "return1&2&3&4": 0.8888888888888888, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 0.8888888888888888, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 11.111111111111116, "cumulative_return1": 0.5397983916919038, "cumulative_return1&2": 3.1437861993840515, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 27.483582791444935, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 456.0292185647718, "indexx": 2311, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.035759110443109, "cumreturn1b": 0.9954261774895498, "cumreturndow": 0.9898731847660052, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9831612764530135}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2322, "level_0": 2382, "index": 67960, "text": "ITEM 2.

THE COMPANY\u2019S PORTFOLIO INCLUDES MARKET-LEADING SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES FOR REAL-TIME ANALYTICS, CUSTOMER ACQUISITION AND ACTIVATION, CUSTOMER VALUE MANAGEMENT AND LOYALTY FOR THE TELECOM INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY HAS MOVED FROM SELLING TECHNOLOGY TO OFFERING BUSINESS SOLUTIONS. THE VALUE PROPOSITION LIKEWISE HAS MOVED AWAY FROM COST SAVINGS TO A FOCUS ON REVENUE INCREASES FOR THE CARRIER AND OUR BUSINESS MODEL HAS MOVED FROM CLASSIC CAPITAL EXPENDITURE LICENSE AND SERVICES TO OPERATING EXPENSE MODELS BASED ON MANAGED SERVICES WITH PERFORMANCE FEES.  IN 2017, WE COMPLETED OUR ACQUISITIONS OF BLS AND THE FOUR BUSINESS OPERATING UNITS OF THE \u201cLUMATA ENTITIES\u201d. BLS SOLUTIONS CAN TURN CUSTOMER DATA INTO ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS AND PERSONALIZED CONTEXTUAL OFFERS.

ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR TECHNOLOGY FURTHER EXPANDS OUR MANAGED SERVICES PLATFORM FOR DELIVERING ON-TAP STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL SOLUTIONS.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THERE WAS A SUSTAINED DECLINE IN THE MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE PERFORMED AN INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERED, ALONG WITH OTHER POSSIBLE FACTORS AFFECTING THE ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S REPORTING UNIT FOR THE PURPOSES OF PERFORMING A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, INCLUDING MANAGEMENT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT EXPECTED FUTURE REVENUE FORECASTS AND DISCOUNT RATES, CHANGES IN THE OVERALL ECONOMY, TRENDS IN THE STOCK PRICE, ESTIMATED CONTROL PREMIUM, OTHER OPERATING CONDITIONS, AND THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND GOODWILL. AS A RESULT OF THE SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE CURRENT MARKET CAPITALIZATION DESPITE ANY OF THE OTHER POSITIVE FACTORS CONTEMPLATED AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, THE OUTCOME OF THIS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTED IN A CHARGE FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL FOR THE REMAINING CARRYING VALUE OF $6.7 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  CONSOLIDATED REVENUE WAS $6.3 MILLION AND $8.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND $13.0 MILLION AND $16.3 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018. THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO THE DECLINE IN SERVICES  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUE WITH OUR HISTORICAL CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH NON-RENEWALS OF ON-GOING SERVICES OR CONCLUSION OF LARGE PROJECTS, OFFSET BY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN LICENSE FEES AND NEW CLIENT ENGAGEMENTS.  WE HAVE OPERATIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS USED TO PREPARE THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHICH ARE TRANSLATED INTO OUR REPORTING CURRENCY, U.S. DOLLARS. CHANGES IN THE EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THESE CURRENCIES AND OUR REPORTING CURRENCY ARE PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE CHANGES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENT AMOUNTS. THE MAJORITY OF THE CHANGES IN 2019 AND 2018 ARE A RESULT OF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENING ON AVERAGE VERSUS THE BRITISH POUND STERLING.

SEE NOTE 8 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  FINANCIAL CONDITION  OUR WORKING CAPITAL POSITION DECREASED $3.7 MILLION, OR 46%, TO $4.4 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 FROM $8.1 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL IS RELATED TO A DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND UNBILLED WORK IN PROGRESS ALONG WITH AN INCREASE IN UNEARNED REVENUE, CURRENT PORTION OF NOTES PAYABLE,  AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES, INCLUDING THE RECORDING OF AN ADDITIONAL CURRENT LIABILITY RELATED TO TOPIC 842, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN CONTRACT RECEIVABLES AND PREPAID AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS DISCLOSED IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, EXCEPT THAT AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, OUR FIXED CHARGE RATIO WAS 0.26, WHICH FAILED TO MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIRED 1.25 FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, AND OUR LEVERAGE RATIO WAS 3.4, WHICH FAILED TO MEET THE MAXIMUM REQUIRED 2.0 LEVERAGE RATIO. WE ARE NEGOTIATING AMENDMENTS TO THE LOAN AGREEMENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY FINANCED OPERATIONS THROUGH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND BANK BORROWINGS. AT JUNE 30, 2019, OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY WAS $5.3 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND $8.5 MILLION IN CONTRACT RECEIVABLES, NET OF ALLOWANCES. OUR ANTICIPATED USES OF CASH IN THE FUTURE WILL BE TO MAKE TERM LOAN PAYMENTS AND FUND THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS BOTH ORGANICALLY AND BY EXPANDING OUR CUSTOMER BASE INTERNATIONALLY. OTHER USES OF CASH WILL INCLUDE PRODUCTS TECHNOLOGY EXPANSION AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018 WAS $0.5 MILLION AND $3.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES OF $1.8 MILLION IN UNEARNED REVENUE, $0.4 MILLION DECREASE IN UNBILLED WORK-IN-PROGRESS, AND AN INCREASE OF $0.4 MILLION OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NET LOSS OF $8.1 MILLION (OFFSET BY NONCASH CHARGES OF $7.8 MILLION), AN INCREASE IN CONTRACT RECEIVABLES OF $0.8 MILLION, AND AN INCREASE IN PREPAID AND OTHER ASSETS OF $0.5 MILLION. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NET INCOME OF $0.6 MILLION, INCREASED BY NON-CASH CHARGES OF $1.6 MILLION, DECREASE IN CONTRACT RECEIVABLES OF $0.7 MILLION, UNBILLED WORK-IN-PROCESS OF $0.3 MILLION, AND INCREASE IN UNEARNED REVENUE OF $1.1 MILLION, OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION RELATED PRIMARILY TO VENDOR PAYMENTS.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, TOGETHER WITH ANTICIPATED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR TERM LOAN PAYMENTS, WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. IN MAKING THIS ASSESSMENT WE CONSIDERED THE FOLLOWING.  \u00b7  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE AT JUNE 30, 2019 OF $5.3 MILLION;  \u00b7  OUR WORKING CAPITAL BALANCE OF $4.4 MILLION; AND  \u00b7  OUR ABILITY TO HISTORICALLY GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OF $0.5 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, AND $2.6 MILLION AND $3.5 MILLION FOR FULL YEARS ENDED 2018, AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  AS SET FORTH IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 UNDER \u201cITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\u201d, OUR TERM LOAN BORROWINGS REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM CURRENT RATIO, A SPECIFIED RATIO OF TOTAL LIABILITIES TO EBITDA AND A MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN THE TERM LOAN AND THE LOAN FACILITY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO WAS 0.81, WHICH FAILED TO MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIRED 1.25 FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO. ON MARCH 29, 2019, WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM EAST WEST BANK THAT WAIVED THE DECEMBER 31, 2018 VIOLATION.

WE ARE NEGOTIATING AMENDMENTS TO THE LOAN AGREEMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE CLASSIFIED THE ENTIRE $4.2 MILLION IN OUTSTANDING DEBT AS A CURRENT LIABILITY.  WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE RISKS WHICH IMPACT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND OUR CONSOLIDATED EQUITY, AS WELL AS OUR CONSOLIDATED CASH POSITION DUE TO TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES RESULTED IN DECREASES IN CASH OF LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION AND $0.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HEDGE OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE, BUT WE MONITOR RATE CHANGES AND MAY HEDGE OUR EXPOSURES IF WE SEE SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE TRENDS IN EXCHANGE RATES.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE A MATERIAL CURRENT EFFECT OR THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "EVOLVING SYSTEMS INC", "CIK": 1052054, "Date": "2019-08-19T00:00:00", "Ticker": "EVOL", "Name": "Evolving Systems Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 7371.0, "Business": "CO", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 841010843.0, "key": "20190819EVOL", "labelr1": -2.7397260273972632, "labelr2": 19.71830985915493, "labelr3": -5.882352941176463, "labelr4": -7.500000000000008, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.6143708999999999, "prof1": 0.38562912, "return1&2": 0.8248118850086824, "return1&2&3": 0.8733302311856638, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9388299985245888, "return2": 0.8028169014084507, "return1": 1.0273972602739727, "return3": 1.0588235294117647, "return4": 1.0750000000000002, "1_day_return": -2.7397260273972597, "cumulative_return1": 0.4733944342249871, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": -0.0, "indexx": 2322, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9803020654440066, "cumreturn1b": 0.9758183377900379, "cumreturndow": 0.982038608343735, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9766403092295097}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2333, "level_0": 2394, "index": 31516, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, THE INFORMATION CONTAINED UNDER THE CAPTION \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,\u201d WHICH APPEARS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS REPORT, AND THE INFORMATION IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018.  OVERVIEW  SPARTANNASH, HEADQUARTERED IN GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN, IS A LEADING MULTI-REGIONAL GROCERY DISTRIBUTOR AND GROCERY RETAILER WHOSE CORE BUSINESSES INCLUDE DISTRIBUTING GROCERY PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSE GROUP OF INDEPENDENT AND CHAIN RETAILERS, ITS CORPORATE OWNED RETAIL STORES, MILITARY COMMISSARIES AND EXCHANGES IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS PREMIER FRESH PRODUCE DISTRIBUTION AND FRESH FOOD PROCESSING. THE COMPANY OPERATES THREE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: FOOD DISTRIBUTION, MILITARY AND RETAIL. THE COMPANY SERVES CUSTOMERS IN ALL 50 STATES.  THE COMPANY\u2019S FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT PROVIDES A WIDE VARIETY OF NATIONALLY BRANDED AND PRIVATE BRAND GROCERY PRODUCTS AND PERISHABLE FOOD PRODUCTS TO APPROXIMATELY 2,100 INDEPENDENT RETAIL LOCATIONS, THE COMPANY\u2019S CORPORATE OWNED RETAIL STORES, FOOD SERVICE DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS. THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT PRIMARILY CONDUCTS BUSINESS IN THE MIDWEST AND SOUTHEAST REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY PROCESSES FRESH-CUT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND OTHER VALUE-ADDED MEAL SOLUTIONS AND SUPPLIES THESE PRODUCTS TO GROCERY RETAILERS AND FOOD SERVICE DISTRIBUTORS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S MILITARY SEGMENT CONTRACTS WITH MANUFACTURERS TO DISTRIBUTE A WIDE VARIETY OF GROCERY PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO MILITARY COMMISSARIES AND EXCHANGES LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, EUROPE, CUBA, PUERTO RICO, HONDURAS, BAHRAIN, DJIBOUTI AND EGYPT. THE COMPANY HAS OVER 40 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE ACTING AS A DISTRIBUTOR TO U.S. MILITARY COMMISSARIES AND EXCHANGES. THE COMPANY IS THE EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE SUPPLIER OF PRIVATE BRAND PRODUCTS TO U.S. MILITARY COMMISSARIES AND IS CONTINUING TO PARTNER WITH DECA IN THE ROLLOUT OF PRIVATE BRAND PRODUCTS TO MILITARY COMMISSARIES WHICH BEGAN DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017.  AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY\u2019S RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATED 160 CORPORATE OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE MIDWEST REGION PRIMARILY UNDER THE BANNERS OF  FAMILY FARE, MARTIN\u2019S SUPER MARKETS, VG\u2019S FOOD AND PHARMACY, D&W FRESH MARKETS, SUN MART  AND  FAMILY FRESH MARKET.  THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS PHARMACY SERVICES IN 98 OF ITS CORPORATE OWNED RETAIL STORES AND OPERATES 37 FUEL CENTERS. THE RETAIL STORES HAVE A \u201cNEIGHBORHOOD MARKET\u201d FOCUS TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM SUPERCENTERS AND LIMITED ASSORTMENT STORES.  ALL FISCAL QUARTERS ARE 12 WEEKS, EXCEPT FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S FIRST QUARTER, WHICH IS 16 WEEKS AND WILL GENERALLY INCLUDE THE EASTER HOLIDAY. THE FOURTH QUARTER INCLUDES THE THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS, AND DEPENDING ON THE FISCAL YEAR END, MAY INCLUDE THE NEW YEAR\u2019S HOLIDAY.  IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE MAY VARY WITH SEASONALITY. MANY STORES ARE DEPENDENT ON TOURISM AND THEREFORE, ARE MOST AFFECTED BY SEASONS AND WEATHER PATTERNS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF SNOWFALL DURING THE WINTER MONTHS AND THE RANGE OF TEMPERATURE DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS.  2019 SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JULY 13, 2019, THE COMPANY MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND BETTER POSITIONED ITSELF FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. IN ADDITION TO REALIZING SALES GROWTH, THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON ITS OTHER TOP OBJECTIVES FOR THE CURRENT YEAR, INCLUDING STRENGTHENING ITS MANAGEMENT TEAM, SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS, GENERATING IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH ITS PROJECT ONE TEAM INITIATIVE, AND REDUCING ITS DEBT, WORKING CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL LEVERAGE RATIOS, WHICH WILL ALL CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVED GROWTH IN ADJUSTED OPERATING EARNINGS AND ADJUSTED EBITDA.  SECOND QUARTER 2019 OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE.  \u2022  THE COMPANY REALIZED SALES GROWTH OF OVER 5% FROM THE SAME QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE NEWLY ACQUIRED MARTIN\u2019S BUSINESS IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT AND GROWTH IN THE MILITARY DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT. BEFORE THE INTERCOMPANY ELIMINATION OF MARTIN\u2019S SALES, THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT ALSO REALIZED GROWTH OF 3.0%.  \u2022  IN CONNECTION WITH PROJECT ONE TEAM, THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NUMBER OF THE INITIATIVES AND REMAINS ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE A RUN RATE OF OVER $20 MILLION IN ANNUAL COST SAVINGS WITHIN THE NEXT 24 MONTHS. INITIATIVES CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF BEING IMPLEMENTED INCLUDE IMPROVING THE SYSTEMS AND POLICIES FOR INVENTORY PROCUREMENT AND MANAGEMENT, SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCY AND AUTOMATION OF ROUTINE ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS.  18  \u2022  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY APPOINTED WALT LENTZ AS THE PRESIDENT OF FOOD DISTRIBUTION. MR. LENTZ HAS AN EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND IN LOGISTICS, SUPPLY CHAIN AND FOOD MANUFACTURING, INCLUDING ROLES AS ACTING CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF SUPPLY CHAIN OFFICER OF PEAPOD LLC, THE GROCERY ECOMMERCE BUSINESS DIVISION OF AHOLD DELHAIZE. HE OVERSEES THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT AND HAS ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S SUPPLY CHAIN. HE HAS JOINED THE OTHER LEADERS OF SPARTANNASH IN DEVELOPING TEAMS TO POSITION THE COMPANY FOR LONG-TERM SUSTAINABLE GROWTH.  \u2022  SINCE THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, THE COMPANY HAS PAID DOWN OVER $90.0 MILLION IN DEBT, RESULTING IN AN $8 MILLION REDUCTION IN THE DEBT BALANCE DESPITE USING APPROXIMATELY $87.0 MILLION TO FUND THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2019. THE COMPANY ALSO REDUCED ITS WORKING CAPITAL BY OVER $15.0 MILLION FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WHILE CONTINUING TO GROW SALES. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND DEBT REDUCTION AND IS TARGETING TOTAL WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS OF $30.0 MILLION FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR.  \u2022  THE COMPANY RECENTLY MADE THE DECISION TO REPOSITION ITS FRESH PRODUCTION OPERATIONS.  AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE, THE COMPANY\u2019S FRESH PRODUCTION OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE  THE HIGH-QUALITY CUT FRUITS, VEGETABLES AND CORE DELI OFFERINGS SUCH AS SALADS, SANDWICHES AND WRAPS THAT HAVE BEEN A HALLMARK OF THESE OPERATIONS FOR OVER A DECADE. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY WILL EXIT THE FRESH KITCHEN OPERATIONS, AN AREA OF THE BUSINESS WHICH HAS BEEN UNABLE TO DELIVER ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS  , RESULTING IN LOWER VOLUME PRODUCTION RUNS WHICH WERE NEITHER EFFICIENT NOR PROFITABLE, SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTING TO UNFAVORABLE PERFORMANCE WITHIN THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT.  THE ANNUAL NET SALES IMPACT OF EXITING THE FRESH KITCHEN OPERATIONS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019, THE COMPANY EXPECTS FOOD DISTRIBUTION TO ACHIEVE LOW- TO MID-SINGLE DIGIT SALES GROWTH DRIVEN BY EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND NEW BUSINESS. THIS EXPECTATION EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY SALES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE MARTIN\u2019S BUSINESS. IN THE MILITARY SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT NEW BUSINESS WITHIN THE SEGMENT, INCLUDING CONTINUED PRIVATE BRAND GROWTH, WILL LARGELY OFFSET THE NEGATIVE DECA COMPARABLE SALES TREND. WITHIN THE RETAIL SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TOTAL SALES WILL INCREASE DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S AND THE SIGNIFICANT CURRENT YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BRAND POSITIONING, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF STORE RATIONALIZATION PLANS.

NET SALES FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD ENDED JULY 13, 2019 (\u201cYEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD\u201d) INCREASED $257.3 MILLION, OR 6.0%, TO $4.54 BILLION FROM $4.28 BILLION IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD ENDED JULY 14, 2018 (\u201cPRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD\u201d). THE INCREASES WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREMENTAL SALES FROM THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION.  FOOD DISTRIBUTION NET SALES DECREASED $6.3 MILLION, OR 0.7%, TO $935.4 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER FROM $941.7 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. NET SALES FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD INCREASED $7.7 MILLION, OR 0.4%, FROM $2.10 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD. BEFORE THE IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF SALES TO MARTIN\u2019S, FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION AT THE BEGINNING OF 2019, SALES GREW 3.0% AND 4.2% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY. THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE INCREASES EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE MARTIN\u2019S ELIMINATION WERE DUE TO SALES GROWTH FROM EXISTING CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY\u2019S RATE OF SALES GROWTH WITHIN THIS SEGMENT DECELERATED FROM RECENT QUARTERS, LARGELY DUE TO UNSEASONABLY COOL AND WET WEATHER DURING THE MONTHS OF MAY AND JUNE. THESE TRENDS IMPROVED DURING THE MONTH OF JULY AS THE WEATHER IMPROVED AND THE RATE OF GROWTH RETURNED TO THAT OBSERVED IN RECENT QUARTERS.  MILITARY NET SALES INCREASED $0.9 MILLION, OR 0.2%, TO $490.6 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER FROM $489.7 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. NET SALES FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD INCREASED $8.7 MILLION, OR 0.8%, FROM $1.15 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD TO $1.16 BILLION. THE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL VOLUME FROM NEW BUSINESS WITH AN EXISTING CUSTOMER THAT COMMENCED LATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND GROWTH IN DECA\u2019S PRIVATE BRAND PROGRAM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMPARABLE SALES AT DECA OPERATED LOCATIONS.  RETAIL NET SALES INCREASED $105.4 MILLION, OR 22.7%, TO $570.0 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER FROM $464.6 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  NET SALES FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD INCREASED $240.9 MILLION, OR 23.4%, FROM $1.03 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD TO $1.27 BILLION.  THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREMENTAL SALES FROM THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF MARTIN\u2019S, SALES DECREASED 3.3% AND 3.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY, AS A RESULT OF STORE CLOSURES AND NEGATIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES. COMPARABLE STORE SALES, EXCLUDING FUEL, DECREASED 2.0% FOR THE QUARTER  AND DECREASED 1.1% PERCENT FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD  . COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR THE QUARTER WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE SHIFT OF THE POST-EASTER WEEK INTO THE SECOND QUARTER BY 0.5%. THE COMPANY DEFINES A RETAIL STORE AS COMPARABLE WHEN IT IS IN OPERATION FOR 14 ACCOUNTING PERIODS (A PERIOD EQUALS FOUR WEEKS), REGARDLESS OF REMODELS, EXPANSIONS OR RELOCATED STORES. THE COMPANY\u2019S DEFINITION OF COMPARABLE STORE SALES MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES AT OTHER COMPANIES.  GROSS PROFIT  \u2013 GROSS PROFIT REPRESENTS NET SALES LESS COST OF SALES, WHICH FOR ALL NON-PRODUCTION OPERATIONS INCLUDES PURCHASE COSTS, IN-BOUND FREIGHT, PHYSICAL INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS, MARKDOWNS AND PROMOTIONAL ALLOWANCES AND EXCLUDES WAREHOUSING COSTS, DEPRECIATION AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S FOOD PROCESSING OPERATIONS, COST OF SALES INCLUDES DIRECT PRODUCT AND PRODUCTION COSTS, INBOUND FREIGHT, PURCHASING AND RECEIVING COSTS, UTILITIES, DEPRECIATION, AND OTHER INDIRECT PRODUCTION COSTS AND EXCLUDES OUT-BOUND FREIGHT AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE COMPANY\u2019S GROSS PROFIT DEFINITION MAY NOT BE IDENTICAL TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. VENDOR ALLOWANCES THAT RELATE TO THE BUYING AND MERCHANDISING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PROMOTIONAL ALLOWANCES, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ALLOWANCES ON PURCHASED QUANTITIES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, SLOTTING ALLOWANCES, WHICH ARE BILLED TO VENDORS FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S MERCHANDISING COSTS, SUCH AS SETTING UP WAREHOUSE INFRASTRUCTURE. VENDOR ALLOWANCES ARE RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION IN COST OF SALES WHEN THE PRODUCT IS SOLD. LUMP SUM PAYMENTS RECEIVED FOR MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACTS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL TERMS. THE DISTRIBUTION SEGMENTS INCLUDE SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS IN THE SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE SECTION OF OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.  GROSS PROFIT INCREASED $23.3 MILLION, OR 8.8%, TO $289.0 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER FROM $265.7 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT WAS 14.5% COMPARED TO 14.0% IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. GROSS PROFIT FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD INCREASED $57.9 MILLION, OR 9.5%, FROM $608.9 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD TO $666.7 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD WAS 14.7% COMPARED TO 14.2% IN THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD. AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD CHANGE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARGINS IN OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  \u2013 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cSG&A\u201d) EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND WAGES, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, WAREHOUSING COSTS, STORE OCCUPANCY COSTS, SHIPPING AND HANDLING, UTILITIES, EQUIPMENT RENTAL, DEPRECIATION (TO THE EXTENT NOT INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES), OUT-BOUND FREIGHT AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  20  SG&A EXPENSES  INCREASED TO  $266.5  MILLION IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER  FROM  $236.2  MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, REPRESENTING  13.4%  OF NET SALES IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER COMPARED TO  12.5%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  SG&A EXPENSES FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD  IN  CREASED  $81.6  MILLION, OR  15.0%  ,  FROM  $545.3  MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD TO  $626.9  MILLION, AND  IN  CREASED  FROM  12.7%  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES IN THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD COMPARED TO  13.8%.  THE INCREASE IN EXPENSES AS A RATE OF SALES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER  AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO  AN INCREASE IN THE MIX OF RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATIONS WITH  THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S  AS WELL AS HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS IN BOTH MILITARY AND FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENTS.  THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY FAVORABLE VARIANCES RELATED TO INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSE ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS.  MERGER/ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION  \u2013 SECOND QUARTER AND PRIOR YEAR QUARTER RESULTS INCLUDED $0.6 MILLION AND $0.8 MILLION OF MERGER/ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY. THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD AND THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD RESULTS INCLUDED $1.4 MILLION AND $3.0 MILLION OF MERGER/ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES, RESPECTIVELY. THE EXPENSES ARE MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION OF MARTIN\u2019S IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND THE  INTEGRATION OF SPARTAN STORES, INC. AND NASH-FINCH COMPANY  IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES (GAINS) AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT \u2013  SECOND QUARTER AND PRIOR YEAR QUARTER RESULTS INCLUDED CHARGES OF $14.6 MILLION AND GAINS OF $1.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT ACTIVITY. THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD AND THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD RESULTS INCLUDED CHARGES OF $8.9 MILLION AND $5.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT ACTIVITY. THE SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE AMOUNTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHANGES THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED RELATED TO THE CAITO FRESH PRODUCTION BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE DECISION TO EXIT THE FRESH KITCHEN OPERATIONS AND THE YEAR-TO-DATE CHARGES ARE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS ON THE SALE OF A PREVIOUSLY CLOSED DISTRIBUTION CENTER. THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE AMOUNT INCLUDES CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S RETAIL STORE AND WAREHOUSE RATIONALIZATION PLANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  GOODWILL  THE COMPANY PERFORMS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT IT WOULD BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, THE COMPANY ASSESSED WHETHER THERE WERE ANY INDICATORS THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION REPORTING UNIT WAS IN EXCESS OF ITS FAIR VALUE. ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS PERFORMED BY THE COMPANY IS WHETHER THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ENTERPRISE AS A WHOLE IS GREATER THAN THE MARKET CAPITALIZATION, CONSIDERING A REASONABLE CONTROL PREMIUM. AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER AND INTO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 THE DECLINE IN THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK PRICE SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASED MARKET CAPITALIZATION, AND THE DECLINE BECAME SUSTAINED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER. AS A RESULT OF THIS INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANY PERFORMED AN INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION REPORTING UNIT, THE ONLY REPORTING UNIT WHICH CARRIES A GOODWILL BALANCE.  THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION REPORTING UNIT PRIMARILY BASED ON THE INCOME APPROACH USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL AND ALSO INCORPORATES THE MARKET APPROACH USING OBSERVABLE COMPARABLE COMPANY INFORMATION. AS A RESULT OF THE SECOND QUARTER IMPAIRMENT TEST, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION REPORTING UNIT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY IN EXCESS OF ITS CARRYING VALUE.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED BY THE COMPANY IN PREPARING THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE UNDER THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD INCLUDE.  \u2022  WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL (\u201cWACC\u201d): THE DETERMINATION OF THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL INCORPORATES CURRENT INTEREST RATES, EQUITY RISK PREMIUMS, AND OTHER MARKET-BASED EXPECTATIONS REGARDING EXPECTED INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WACC REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF AN EQUITY RATE OF RETURN AND A DEBT RATE OF RETURN, WHICH ARE SPECIFIC TO THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION REPORTING UNIT OPERATES.  \u2022  REVENUE GROWTH RATES: THE COMPANY DEVELOPS ITS FORECASTS BASED ON RECENT SALES DATA FOR EXISTING OPERATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING MANAGEMENT\u2019S FUTURE EXPECTATIONS.  \u2022  OPERATING PROFITS: THE COMPANY USES HISTORICAL OPERATING MARGINS AS A BASIS FOR OUR PROJECTIONS WITHIN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL. MARGINS WITHIN THE FORECAST MAY VARY DUE TO FUTURE EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO BOTH PRODUCT AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.  THE COMPANY COMPARED THE RESULTS OF THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL TO OBSERVABLE COMPARABLE COMPANY MARKET MULTIPLES TO SUPPORT THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES. THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE IMPLIED MULTIPLE WAS REASONABLE WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPARABLE COMPANY RANGE, AND THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE WERE SUPPORTABLE.  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY RECONCILED THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE FOR THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION REPORTING UNIT TO THE CURRENT MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF THE ENTERPRISE AS A WHOLE. WHILE THE RETAIL AND MILITARY REPORTING UNITS DO NOT CARRY GOODWILL BALANCES, THEIR FAIR VALUES ARE COMBINED WITH THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE OF THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION REPORTING UNIT IN DETERMINING THE ENTERPRISE VALUE OF THE TOTAL COMPANY. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST, THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE ENTERPRISE VALUE OF THE COMPANY AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION, IMPLYING A REASONABLE CONTROL PREMIUM, WAS WITHIN THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPECTATIONS BASED ON RECENT MARKET TRANSACTIONS.  21  OPERATING EARNINGS  (LOSS)  \u2013  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OPERATING EARNINGS  (LOSS)  BY SEGMENT AND VARIANCES IN OPERATING EARNINGS  (LOSS)  .  12 WEEKS ENDED  28 WEEKS ENDED  (IN THOUSANDS)  JULY 13, 2019  JULY 14, 2018  VARIANCE  JULY 13, 2019  JULY 14, 2018  VARIANCE  FOOD DISTRIBUTION  $272  $18,724  $(18,452  )  $24,864  $43,245  $(18,381  )  MILITARY  (1,603  )  3,099  (4,702  )  (3,160  )  4,612  (7,772  )  RETAIL  8,701  7,995  706  7,875  7,709  166  TOTAL OPERATING EARNINGS  $7,370  $29,818  $(22,448  )  $29,579  $55,566  $(25,987  )  OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED $22.4 MILLION, OR 75.3% TO $7.4 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER FROM $29.8 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.

INCOME TAXES  \u2013 THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 30.3% AND 22.7% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD AND PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD, THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES WERE -72.5% AND 24.8%, RESPECTIVELY. THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO STATE TAXES AND STOCK COMPENSATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FEDERAL TAX CREDITS. IN THE PRIOR YEAR, THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO STATE TAXES, FEDERAL TAX CREDITS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. THE TAX IMPACTS OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ARE PRIMARILY REALIZED IN THE FIRST QUARTER DUE TO THE TIMING OF AWARDS AND VESTING SCHEDULES.  22  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  IN ADDITION TO REPORTING FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES INFORMATION REGARDING ADJUSTED OPERATING EARNINGS, ADJUSTED EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201cADJUSTED EBITDA\u201d).

NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED DURING THE CURRENT YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD FROM THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD BY APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CASH GENERATED FROM EARNINGS, MOSTLY OFFSET BY IMPROVEMENTS IN WORKING CAPITAL.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $74.5 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION MADE IN THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF REAL PROPERTY FOR A PREVIOUSLY CLOSED SITE.  THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION, MILITARY AND RETAIL SEGMENTS UTILIZED 23.4%, 7.6% AND 69.0% OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $76.0 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR USE OF CASH PRIMARILY DUE TO BORROWINGS ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO FUND THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION.  NET CASH USED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  NET CASH USED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS CONTAINS THE NET CASH FLOWS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S RETAIL AND FOOD DISTRIBUTION DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF FACILITY MAINTENANCE EXPENDITURES.  DEBT MANAGEMENT  TOTAL DEBT, INCLUDING FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES, WAS $702.2 MILLION AND $698.1 MILLION AS OF JULY 13, 2019 AND DECEMBER 29, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL DEBT WAS DRIVEN BY THE CURRENT YEAR ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PAYMENTS.  LIQUIDITY  THE COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND ITS SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY WHICH HAS MAXIMUM AVAILABLE CREDIT OF $1.1 BILLION. AS OF JULY 13, 2019, THE SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY HAD OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OF $660.9 MILLION. ADDITIONAL AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S $1.1 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY ARE BASED ON STIPULATED ADVANCE RATES ON ELIGIBLE ASSETS, AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAIN EXCESS AVAILABILITY OF 10% OF THE BORROWING BASE, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY HAD EXCESS AVAILABILITY AFTER THE 10% COVENANT OF $249.0 MILLION AT JULY 13, 2019. PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASES OF OUTSTANDING SHARES ARE PERMITTED, PROVIDED THAT CERTAIN LEVELS OF EXCESS AVAILABILITY ARE MAINTAINED. THE CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES FOR THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT, OF WHICH $10.8 MILLION WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF JULY 13, 2019. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY MATURES DECEMBER 18, 2023 AND IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, AND DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE CASH FLOW AT OR ABOVE CURRENT LEVELS OR THAT THE COMPANY WILL MAINTAIN ITS ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY EXECUTED AN EARLY PAYMENT OF ITS TERM LOAN (TRANCHE A-2) IN THE AMOUNT OF $55.0 MILLION WITH AVAILABLE BORROWINGS FROM ITS REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO GENERATE INTEREST SAVINGS OF NEARLY $2 MILLION ANNUALLY AS A RESULT OF UTILIZING LOWER RATE FINANCING.  28  THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT RATIO (CURRENT ASSETS TO CURRENT LIABILITIES) WAS  1.76  -TO-  1 AT  JULY 13  , 201  9  COMPARED TO  2.10  -TO-  1 AT DECEMBER  29  , 201  8  ,  AND ITS INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS  $430.7  MILLION AT  JULY 13  , 201  9  COMPARED TO  $524.6  MILLION AT DECEMBER  29  , 201  8  . NET DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO WAS  0.50  -TO-  1 AT  JULY 13  , 201  9  COMPARED TO  0.49  -TO-  1 AT DECEMBER  29  , 201  8.  THE CURRENT YEAR RATIOS INCLUDE THE I  MPACT OF  THE  ADOPTION OF  THE  NEW LEASE STANDARD (ASU 2016-02)  AND THEREFORE LACK COMPARABILITY TO THE PRIOR YEAR RATIOS.  TOTAL NET DEBT IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT IS DEFINED AS LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES, PLUS CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES, LESS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE RATIO OF NET DEBT TO CAPITAL IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET DEBT, AS DEFINED PREVIOUSLY, BY TOTAL CAPITAL (NET DEBT PLUS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY). THE COMPANY BELIEVES BOTH MANAGEMENT AND ITS INVESTORS FIND THE INFORMATION USEFUL BECAUSE IT REFLECTS THE AMOUNT OF LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY AVAILABLE CASH AND TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS. TOTAL NET DEBT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES.  FOLLOWING IS A RECONCILIATION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES TO TOTAL NET LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES AS OF JULY 13, 2019 AND DECEMBER 29, 2018.  JULY 13,  DECEMBER 29,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES  $17,709  $18,263  LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES  684,527  679,797  TOTAL DEBT  702,236  698,060  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  (19,949  )  (18,585  )  TOTAL NET LONG-TERM DEBT  $682,287  $679,475  FOR INFORMATION ON CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, SEE THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018. AT JULY 13, 2019, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANY\u2019S SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.  CASH DIVIDENDS  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JULY 13, 2019, THE COMPANY RETURNED $6.9 MILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS FROM DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. A 5.6% INCREASE IN THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND RATE FROM $0.18 PER SHARE TO $0.19 PER SHARE WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ANNOUNCED ON FEBRUARY 28, 2019. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO PAY A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND, ADOPTION OF A DIVIDEND POLICY DOES NOT COMMIT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO DECLARE FUTURE DIVIDENDS. EACH FUTURE DIVIDEND WILL BE CONSIDERED AND DECLARED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT ITS DISCRETION. WHETHER THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONTINUES TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION, ANTICIPATED PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF ITS CREDIT FACILITIES.  UNDER THE SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE COMPANY IS GENERALLY PERMITTED TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN ANY FISCAL YEAR UP TO AN AMOUNT SUCH THAT ALL CASH DIVIDENDS, TOGETHER WITH ANY CASH DISTRIBUTIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, DO NOT EXCEED $35.0 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS GENERALLY PERMITTED TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE SHARES IN EXCESS OF $35.0 MILLION IN ANY FISCAL YEAR SO LONG AS ITS EXCESS AVAILABILITY, AS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, IS IN EXCESS OF 10% OF THE TOTAL BORROWING BASE, AS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, BEFORE AND AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY HAS ALSO MADE CERTAIN COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS THAT EXTEND BEYOND JULY 13, 2019. THESE COMMITMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PURCHASE COMMITMENTS (AS DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018), STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT OF $10.8 MILLION AS OF JULY 13, 2019, AND INTEREST ON LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES.  29  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, THE COMPANY EVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO BAD DEBTS, INVENTORIES, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCOME TAXES, SELF-INSURANCE RESERVES, RESTRUCTURING COSTS, RETIREMENT BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT MAY NOT BE READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S ONGOING REVIEW, THE COMPANY MAKES ADJUSTMENTS IT CONSIDERS APPROPRIATE UNDER THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.

EACH DIVISION EXPERIENCED A YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE, BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE DECREASE IN NET SALES WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY APPLIED TECHNOLOGY. APPLIED TECHNOLOGY'S AG MARKET CONDITIONS DETERIORATED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED TO THE DIVISION'S EXPECTATIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND QUARTER. ABNORMAL WET WEATHER IN THE U.S. CAUSED CHALLENGING FIELD CONDITIONS WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED PLANTING AND APPLICATION ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD AND DROVE REDUCTIONS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND.  THE COMPANY'S OPERATING INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $10.6 MILLION  , DOWN  $6.1 MILLION  , OR  36.4%  , COMPARED  #  22  TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NEGATIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE AS A RESULT OF LOWER SALES VOLUME. OPERATING INCOME ALSO REFLECTED INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN BOTH THE APPLIED TECHNOLOGY AND AEROSTAR DIVISIONS.  NET INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS  $8.8 MILLION  , OR  $0.24  PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF  $13.7 MILLION  , OR  $0.38  PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, EXCLUDING DISCRETE ITEMS, WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF LAST YEAR AT APPROXIMATELY 19 PERCENT. THE PRIOR YEAR'S SECOND QUARTER NET INCOME BENEFITED FROM APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION OF FAVORABLE DISCRETE TAX ITEMS THAT DID NOT REOCCUR IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2019, NET SALES WERE  $196.2 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $213.8 MILLION  , DOWN  8.2%  VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. ENGINEERED FILMS WAS THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN NET SALES DUE TO ITS $8.1   MILLION DECREASE IN HURRICANE RECOVERY FILM SALES AND END-MARKET CHALLENGES IN THE INDUSTRIAL AND GEOMEMBRANE MARKETS.  THE COMPANY'S OPERATING INCOME WAS  $25.7 MILLION  , DOWN  32.7%  FROM THE PRIOR YEAR SIX-MONTH PERIOD. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NEGATIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE AS A RESULT OF LOWER SALES VOLUME. OPERATING INCOME ALSO INCLUDED INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN BOTH APPLIED TECHNOLOGY AND AEROSTAR COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  NET INCOME FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 WAS  $22.0 MILLION  , OR  $0.60  PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF  $35.8 MILLION  , OR  $0.98  PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD.

APPLIED TECHNOLOGY DIVISION RESULTS  APPLIED TECHNOLOGY'S NET SALES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE  $27.4 MILLION  , DOWN  $3.0 MILLION  FROM LAST YEAR'S SECOND QUARTER. GEOGRAPHICALLY, INTERNATIONAL SALES WERE UP 3.4% YEAR-OVER-YEAR, BUT DOMESTIC SALES WERE DOWN  $3.2 MILLION  , OR  13.6%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR. INTERNATIONAL SALES GROWTH WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY STRONG GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA AS A RESULT OF THE DIVISION'S INVESTMENT INTO THE REGION AND STRONG OEM RELATIONSHIPS. CHALLENGING FIELD CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. LED TO LOWER LEVELS OF FIELD APPLICATION ACTIVITIES BY AG RETAILERS AND EXTENDED OEM PLANT SHUTDOWNS, WHICH PRIMARILY CAUSED THE DECREASE IN DOMESTIC SALES.  OPERATING INCOME FOR APPLIED TECHNOLOGY WAS  $4.8 MILLION  , DOWN $4.0 MILLION OR  44.8%  COMPARED TO  $8.8 MILLION  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. LOWER SALES VOLUME AND CORRESPONDING NEGATIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE PRIMARILY DROVE THE DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME.

CHALLENGING FIELD CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. LED TO LOWER LEVELS OF FIELD APPLICATION ACTIVITIES BY AG RETAILERS AND EXTENDED OEM PLANT SHUTDOWNS, WHICH CAUSED THE DECREASE IN DOMESTIC SALES.  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 WAS  $18.1 MILLION  , DOWN  26.9%  COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. THE INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDED INCREMENTAL INVESTMENTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF AGSYNC. PRIOR YEAR OPERATING INCOME ALSO INCLUDED FAVORABLE LEGAL RECOVERIES THAT DID NOT REOCCUR IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020.  ENGINEERED FILMS DIVISION RESULTS  ENGINEERED FILMS\u2019 FISCAL 2020 SECOND QUARTER NET SALES WERE  $57.5 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  $1.4 MILLION  , OR  2.3%  , COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 SECOND QUARTER NET SALES OF  $58.9 MILLION  . THE DIVISION EXPERIENCED END-MARKET CHALLENGES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER IN THE GEOMEMBRANE MARKET AS WELL AS LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED CUSTOMER DEMAND IN THE INDUSTRIAL MARKET. THESE CHALLENGES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET AS THE DIVISION CAUGHT UP ON THE FULFILLMENT OF SALES ORDERS THAT WERE DELAYED FROM THE FIRST QUARTER DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (ERP) PLATFORM.  OPERATING INCOME FOR ENGINEERED FILMS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED  6.1%  TO  $10.2 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $10.8  #  23  MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR SECOND QUARTER.

THE DIVISION EXPECTS TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL EFFICIENCY GAINS AS IT GROWS AND MATURES IN ITS USE OF THE NEW SYSTEM.  NET SALES FOR ENGINEERED FILMS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 WERE  $101.8 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  $17.1 MILLION  , OR  14.4%  , COMPARED TO THE YEAR-TO-DATE SIX-MONTH PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019. HURRICANE RECOVERY FILM SALES WERE DOWN  $8.1 MILLION  IN THE FIRST SIX-MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DIVISION ALSO EXPERIENCED END-MARKET CHALLENGES IN THE GEOMEMBRANE MARKET AS WELL AS LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED CUSTOMER DEMAND IN THE INDUSTRIAL MARKET.  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED  31.2%  TO  $16.5 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $24.0 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY NEGATIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE ON LOWER SALES VOLUME.  AEROSTAR DIVISION RESULTS  AEROSTAR NET SALES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE  $13.2 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  $0.3 MILLION  , OR  2.4%  , COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 SECOND QUARTER NET SALES OF  $13.5 MILLION  . THE DIVISION ACHIEVED YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN ITS CORE STRATOSPHERIC BALLOON AND RADAR PRODUCT LINES; HOWEVER, AEROSTAT SALES DECLINED $3.8 MILLION VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR'S SECOND QUARTER AND DROVE THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE IN DIVISION NET SALES.  OPERATING INCOME FOR AEROSTAR IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS  $2.9 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $3.8 MILLION  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY REDUCED AEROSTAT SALES THAT GENERATED ABOVE DIVISION AVERAGE MARGINS. IN ADDITION, THE DIVISION INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SELLING EXPENSES TO FOCUS ON ADVANCING ITS ENGINEERING SERVICES AND FLIGHT OPERATIONS CAPABILITIES AND TO SUPPORT A CONSISTENT CADENCE OF FULFILLING FUTURE CONTRACTS.  NET SALES FOR AEROSTAR IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 WERE  $25.4 MILLION  , AN INCREASE OF  $1.0 MILLION  , OR  3.9%  , COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. STRONG GROWTH IN THE DIVISION'S CORE STRATOSPHERIC BALLOON AND RADAR SALES DROVE THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE.  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE SIX-MONTH YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF FISCAL 2020 WAS  $4.9 MILLION  COMPARED TO OPERATING INCOME OF  $6.6 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. DESPITE THE INCREASE IN NET SALES, OPERATING INCOME DECREASED DUE TO INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SELLING EXPENSES TO FOCUS ON ADVANCING ITS ENGINEERING SERVICES AND FLIGHT OPERATIONS CAPABILITIES AND TO SUPPORT A CONSISTENT CADENCE OF FULFILLING FUTURE CONTRACTS.

MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE AG MARKET DETERIORATED SIGNIFICANTLY COMPARED TO THE DIVISION'S EXPECTATIONS  #  24  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND QUARTER. ABNORMAL WET WEATHER IN THE U.S. CAUSED CHALLENGING FIELD CONDITIONS WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED PLANTING AND APPLICATION ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD AND DROVE REDUCTIONS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND. GIVEN THE CHALLENGES BEING FACED, SEVERAL KEY OEMS RESPONDED WITH PLANT SHUTDOWNS IN ORDER TO RECALIBRATE PRODUCTION LEVELS TO ALIGN WITH A LOWER FORECAST OF NEW MACHINE SALES. THIS TEMPORARILY HALTED SPRAYER UNIT PRODUCTION. AS A RESULT, APPLIED TECHNOLOGY'S OEM AND AFTERMARKET DEMAND IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE.

GEOGRAPHICALLY IN THE SECOND QUARTER, INTERNATIONAL SALES WERE UP  3.4%  YEAR-OVER-YEAR, AND DOMESTIC SALES WERE DOWN  13.6%  YEAR-OVER-YEAR. FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD, INTERNATIONAL SALES TOTALED  $19.1 MILLION  , AN INCREASE OF  8.3%  FROM PRIOR YEAR. INTERNATIONAL SALES GROWTH FOR BOTH PERIODS WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA AS A RESULT OF THE DIVISION'S INVESTMENT INTO THE REGION AND STRONG OEM RELATIONSHIPS. LONGER THAN EXPECTED OEM PLANT SHUTDOWNS AND LIMITED APPLICATION ACTIVITIES BY AG RETAILERS DROVE A DECLINE IN SALES DOMESTICALLY.  \u2022  INTERNATIONAL SALES.  FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, INTERNATIONAL SALES TOTALED  $7.0 MILLION  , UP  3.4%  FROM  $6.8 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD.

ALTHOUGH AEROSTAT SALES WERE IMMATERIAL IN FISCAL 2020, THE DIVISION WAS ABLE TO DRIVE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN RADAR AND STRATOSPHERIC BALLOON SALES. AEROSTAT SALES VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR AS CUSTOMER DEMAND TENDS TO BE INHERENTLY INCONSISTENT. THE DIVISION'S AEROSTAT PRODUCT LINE IS VERY COMPETITIVE AND CAN GENERATE ABOVE DIVISION AVERAGE MARGINS. THE DIVISION WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPLY AEROSTATS AS DEMAND REQUIRES.  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN.  FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD, GROSS MARGIN DECREASED FROM  44.5%  TO  42.8%  DUE TO UNFAVORABLE SALES MIX. FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD, GROSS MARGIN INCREASED FOR THE CURRENT YEAR FROM  39.6%  TO  41.5%  DUE TO FAVORABLE SALES MIX.  \u2022  OPERATING EXPENSES.  SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2020 OPERATING EXPENSE WAS  $2.7 MILLION  , OR  20.5%  OF NET SALES, AN INCREASE FROM  16.2%  OF NET SALES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. YEAR-TO-DATE OPERATING EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS  22.0%  , UP FROM  12.4%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DIVISION INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 TO FOCUS ON ADVANCING ITS ENGINEERING SERVICES AND FLIGHT OPERATIONS CAPABILITIES AND TO SUPPORT A CONSISTENT CADENCE OF  #  26  FULFILLING FUTURE CONTRACTS. THE DIVISION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED ITS BALLOON LAUNCHES DURING THE THREE- AND SIX-MONTH PERIODS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019.  CORPORATE EXPENSES (ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES; OTHER (EXPENSE), NET; AND INCOME TAXES)  `  THREE MONTHS ENDED  SIX MONTHS ENDED  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  JULY 31,  2019  JULY 31,  2018  JULY 31,  2019  JULY 31,  2018  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  $7,373  $6,819  $13,848  $17,222  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A % OF SALES  7.5%  6.6%  7.1%  8.1%  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  $383  $(139  )  $314  $5,540  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  20.0%  16.8%  15.5%  17.9%  ADMINISTRATIVE SPENDING FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD OF FISCAL 2020 WAS UP  $0.6 MILLION  COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY MERGER AND ACQUISITION (M&A) RELATED ACTIVITIES. ADMINISTRATIVE SPENDING FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD OF FISCAL 2020 WAS DOWN  $3.4 MILLION  COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 AS PRIOR YEAR'S SPENDING INCLUDED AN EXPENSE OF $4.5 MILLION RELATED TO A GIFT TO SOUTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF ACTIVITY RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS OR LOSSES. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET FOR THE THREE- AND SIX-MONTH PERIODS IN FISCAL YEAR 2020. FISCAL 2019 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD INCLUDED A $5.8 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE COMPANY'S EQUITY INTEREST IN SST.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JULY 31,  2019 AND 2018, WERE  20.0%  AND  16.8%  , RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JULY 31,  2019 AND 2018, WERE  15.5%  AND  17.9%  , RESPECTIVELY. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE- AND SIX-MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF DISCRETE TAX ITEMS RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT AND VESTING OF EQUITY COMPENSATION AWARDS. REFER TO NOTE 13  INCOME TAXES  OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THESE IMPACTS TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  OUTLOOK  END-MARKET CONDITIONS IMPACTING OUR APPLIED TECHNOLOGY DIVISION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CHALLENGING THAN EXPECTED. BECAUSE OF THIS AND OTHER CHALLENGES EXPERIENCED IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, WE HAVE UPDATED OUR PREVIOUS EXPECTATIONS OF ACHIEVING YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN BOTH SALES AND DIVISION PROFIT FOR THE FULL-YEAR IN EACH DIVISION. THESE UPDATES ARE OUTLINED BY DIVISION BELOW.  APPLIED TECHNOLOGY EXPERIENCED CHALLENGING CONDITIONS IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 THAT WERE FAR WORSE THAN WE EXPECTED THREE MONTHS AGO. THESE MARKET CONDITIONS RESULTED IN A 10 PERCENT DECLINE IN SALES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER. AS WE BEGIN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, WE EXPECT OEM MACHINE PRODUCTION RATES TO IMPROVE RELATIVE TO THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, AND MARKET SHARE GAINS FROM NEW PRODUCT GROWTH, INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION AND CONTINUED SUCCESS WITH RECENTLY-ACQUIRED AGSYNC TO HELP OFFSET THE CHALLENGING U.S. END-MARKET CONDITIONS. AT THIS TIME, WE EXPECT THE DIVISION\u2019S FISCAL 2020 SECOND HALF SALES AND DIVISION PROFIT TO EXCEED THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S SECOND HALF RESULTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE BELIEVE OUR STRONG OEM RELATIONSHIPS AND BEST-IN-CLASS TECHNOLOGY HAVE POSITIONED US FOR SIGNIFICANT GROWTH AND SUCCESS OVER THE LONG TERM.  ENGINEERED FILMS ALSO HAD END-MARKET CHALLENGES IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 PRIMARILY DUE TO WEAKNESS IN THE INDUSTRIAL AND GEOMEMBRANE MARKETS. IN ADDITION, THE DIVISION EXPERIENCED DIFFICULT YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISONS DUE TO PRIOR YEAR HURRICANE RECOVERY FILM SALES. HOWEVER, THE DIVISION IS WELL POSITIONED TO CAPITALIZE ON THE INVESTMENTS IT HAS MADE OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, AND WE EXPECT YEAR-OVER-YEAR SALES GROWTH IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS YEAR.  AEROSTAR CONTINUES TO ACHIEVE NEW MILESTONES AND LEAD THE INDUSTRY WITH ITS STRATOSPHERIC BALLOON CAPABILITIES. THE DIVISION SHOWED STRENGTH IN ITS CORE MARKETS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR AND INVESTED MORE AGGRESSIVELY IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO SUPPORT LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE DIVISION'S FUTURE AS IT CONTINUES TO INVEST IN BOTH ITS PRODUCT AND TECHNICAL SERVICE OFFERINGS.  WHILE THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED UNEXPECTED NEAR-TERM CHALLENGES IN THE SECOND QUARTER, THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE COMPANY REMAIN VERY STRONG AND WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITIONING IN EACH OF OUR OPERATING DIVISIONS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST  #  27  FOR THE LONG TERM THROUGH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO DRIVE NEW PRODUCT INNOVATION, CAPITAL EQUIPMENT TO IMPROVE AND AUGMENT OUR UNIQUE PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES, AND THE PURSUIT AND CLOSURE OF ADDITIONAL STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS.  WHILE WE WILL NOT ACHIEVE THE GROWTH IN SALES AND DIVISION PROFIT IN EVERY DIVISION THIS FISCAL YEAR AS WE PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED, WE DO EXPECT A STRONGER SECOND HALF SALES PERFORMANCE FOR EACH DIVISION, RELATIVE TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE FIRMLY BELIEVE WE ARE MUCH BETTER POSITIONED TODAY TO FACE END-MARKET CHALLENGES DUE TO THE INVESTMENT DISCIPLINE WE MAINTAINED DURING THE PREVIOUS END-MARKET CHALLENGES WE EXPERIENCED. OUR DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO CONTINUAL INVESTMENT IS SUPPORTED BY THE CONFIDENCE WE HAVE IN OUR ABILITY TO IMPROVE OUR MARKET-LEADING POSITIONS AND DRIVE LONG-TERM GROWTH.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY'S BALANCE SHEET CONTINUES TO REFLECT SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY AND A STRONG CAPITAL BASE. MANAGEMENT FOCUSES ON THE CURRENT CASH BALANCE AND OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN CONSIDERING LIQUIDITY, AS OPERATING CASH FLOWS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THAT CURRENT CASH, COMBINED WITH THE GENERATION OF POSITIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMPANY'S NORMAL OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES BEYOND THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS A CREDIT FACILITY OF UP TO $125.0 MILLION WITH A MATURITY DATE OF APRIL 15, 2020.  THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH BALANCES AND CASH FLOWS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  JULY 31,  2019  JANUARY 31,  2019  JULY 31,  2018  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $69,131  $65,787  $65,439  THREE MONTHS ENDED  SIX MONTHS ENDED  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  JULY 31, 2019  JULY 31, 2018  JULY 31, 2019  JULY 31, 2018  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $17,398  $25,049  $26,160  $38,652  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (1,237  )  (4,673  )  (3,678  )  (1,488  )  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (8,427  )  (6,082  )  (19,092  )  (11,857  )  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  27  (172  )  (46  )  (403  )  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $7,761  $14,122  $3,344  $24,904  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS TOTALED $69.1 MILLION  AT  JULY 31, 2019  , AN INCREASE OF  $3.3 MILLION  FROM $65.8 MILLION  AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE COMPARABLE BALANCE AS OF JULY 31, 2018 WAS $65.4 MILLION  . THE SEQUENTIAL INCREASE IN CASH WAS LED BY THE COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY FROM CASH RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS, WHICH WERE OFFSET BY CASH PAYMENTS FOR INVENTORIES, SERVICES, EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, AND INCOME TAXES. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $26.2 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED WITH  $38.7 MILLION  IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS YEAR-OVER-YEAR WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER NET INCOME AND AN INCREASE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  #  28  THE COMPANY'S CASH NEEDS HAVE MINIMAL SEASONAL TRENDS. AS A RESULT, THE DISCUSSION OF TRENDS IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOCUSES ON THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF YEAR-OVER-YEAR VARIABILITY IN NET WORKING CAPITAL. NET WORKING CAPITAL AND NET WORKING CAPITAL PERCENTAGE ARE METRICS USED BY MANAGEMENT AS A GUIDE IN MEASURING THE EFFICIENT USE OF CASH RESOURCES TO SUPPORT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND GROWTH. THE COMPANY'S NET WORKING CAPITAL FOR THE COMPARATIVE PERIODS WAS AS FOLLOWS.  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  JULY 31, 2019  JULY 31, 2018  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET  $60,700  $61,348  PLUS: INVENTORIES  61,311  55,993  LESS: ACCOUNTS PAYABLE  15,722  14,882  NET WORKING CAPITAL  (A)  $106,289  $102,459  ANNUALIZED NET SALES  (B)  392,232  410,736  NET WORKING CAPITAL PERCENTAGE  (C)  27.1%  24.9%  (A)  NET WORKING CAPITAL IS DEFINED AS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, (NET) PLUS INVENTORIES LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  (B)  ANNUALIZED NET SALES IS DEFINED AS THE MOST RECENT QUARTER NET SALES TIMES FOUR FOR EACH OF THE FISCAL PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY.  (C)  NET WORKING CAPITAL PERCENTAGE IS DEFINED AS NET WORKING CAPITAL DIVIDED BY ANNUALIZED NET SALES.  NET WORKING CAPITAL PERCENTAGE DETERIORATED  220  BASIS POINTS YEAR-OVER-YEAR IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THE INCREASE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL WAS LED BY AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY WITHIN ENGINEERED FILMS AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY. BOTH DIVISIONS EXPECTED HIGHER SALES DEMAND IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND PREPARED INVENTORY LEVELS TO MEET THOSE EXPECTATIONS.  INVENTORY LEVELS INCREASED  $5.3 MILLION  , OR  9.5%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR FROM  $56.0 MILLION  AT JULY 31, 2018, TO  $61.3 MILLION  AT JULY 31, 2019. IN COMPARISON, CONSOLIDATED NET SALES DECREASED  $4.6 MILLION  , OR  4.5%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR IN THE  SECOND QUARTER  . THE INCREASE IN INVENTORY WAS DRIVEN BY ENGINEERED FILMS AND APPLIED TECHNOLOGY AS EACH DIVISION EXPECTED HIGHER SALES DEMAND IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND PREPARED INVENTORY LEVELS TO MEET THOSE EXPECTATIONS.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DECREASED  $0.6 MILLION  OR  1.1%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR TO  $60.7 MILLION  AT  JULY 31, 2019  , FROM  $61.3 MILLION  AT  JULY 31, 2018  . IN COMPARISON, CONSOLIDATED NET SALES DECREASED  $4.6 MILLION  , OR  4.5%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR IN THE  SECOND QUARTER  . LOWER SALES VOLUME AND THE TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE INCREASED  $0.8 MILLION  , OR  5.6%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR FROM  $14.9 MILLION  AT  JULY 31, 2018  , TO  $15.7 MILLION  AT  JULY 31, 2019  . THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO TIMING OF PURCHASES AND CASH PAYMENTS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $3.7 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED WITH CASH USED OF  $1.5 MILLION  IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE WAS CASH RECEIPTS OF $6.6 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN SST IN THE PRIOR YEAR. CAPITAL EXPENDITURE SPENDING WAS DOWN $3.1 MILLION COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR SIX-MONTH PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO PRIOR YEAR INVESTMENTS RELATED TO ENGINEERED FILMS' NEW EXTRUSION LINE (LINE 15).  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 WAS UP  $7.2 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE INCREASE IN CASH OUTFLOWS INCLUDED  $5.8 MILLION  OF SHARE REPURCHASES IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. THERE WERE NO SHARE REPURCHASES IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.  DIVIDENDS PER SHARE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND 2019 WERE CONSISTENT AT 26.0 CENTS PER SHARE. TOTAL CASH OUTFLOWS FOR DIVIDENDS IN THE SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JULY 31, 2019  , AND 2018, WERE  $9.4 MILLION  AND  $9.3 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  NO BORROWING OR REPAYMENT OCCURRED ON THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 OR FISCAL 2019.  OTHER LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT DATED APRIL 15, 2015. THIS AGREEMENT (CREDIT AGREEMENT), MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 10  FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS  OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q, PROVIDES FOR A SYNDICATED SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY UP TO $125 MILLION WITH A MATURITY DATE OF  APRIL 15, 2020  . THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FOR ANY OF THE FISCAL PERIODS COVERED BY THIS FORM 10-Q. AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FOR BORROWINGS AS OF  JULY 31, 2019  WAS  $124.7 MILLION  . THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ENTER INTO A NEW CREDIT FACILITY PRIOR TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT MATURING IN FISCAL 2021.  #  29  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS CUSTOMARY AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO FINANCIAL REPORTING AND NOTIFICATION, LIMITS ON LEVELS OF INDEBTEDNESS AND LIENS, INVESTMENTS, MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS, SALES OF ASSETS, RESTRICTIVE AGREEMENTS, AND CHANGE IN CONTROL AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.

THE COMPANY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL FINANCIAL COVENANTS SET FORTH IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  LETTERS OF CREDIT (LOCS) TOTALING  $0.3 MILLION  AND  $0.5 MILLION  WERE OUTSTANDING AT  JULY 31, 2019  AND  JULY 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. ANY DRAWS REQUIRED UNDER THE LOCS WOULD BE SETTLED WITH AVAILABLE CASH OR BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S KNOWN OFF-BALANCE SHEET DEBT AND OTHER UNRECORDED OBLIGATIONS SINCE THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, OTHER THAN ITEM DISCUSSED BELOW.  RAVEN IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE EARN-OUT PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION OF AEROSTAR'S CLIENT PRIVATE BUSINESS AND THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN SST IN FISCAL 2019 IF CERTAIN POST-CLOSING PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS ARE SATISFIED.

NET SALES FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  1.2%  TO  $30.8 BILLION  FROM  $30.5 BILLION  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE IN NET SALES IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET AND COMPARABLE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS. ONLINE SALES, WHICH CONSIST OF SALES GENERATED ONLINE THROUGH OUR WEBSITES FOR PRODUCTS PICKED UP IN OUR STORES OR DELIVERED TO CUSTOMER LOCATIONS, REPRESENTED  8.9%  OF NET SALES AND GREW  20.1%  DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SALES GROWTH BY  $29 MILLION  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  COMPARABLE SALES  . COMPARABLE SALES IS A MEASURE THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR EXISTING LOCATIONS AND WEBSITES BY MEASURING THE CHANGE IN NET SALES FOR A PERIOD OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-PERIOD OF EQUIVALENT LENGTH. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDES SALES AT ALL LOCATIONS, PHYSICAL AND ONLINE, OPEN GREATER THAN 52 WEEKS (INCLUDING REMODELS AND RELOCATIONS) AND EXCLUDING CLOSED STORES. RETAIL STORES BECOME COMPARABLE ON THE MONDAY FOLLOWING THEIR 365  TH  DAY OF OPERATION. ACQUISITIONS, DIGITAL OR OTHERWISE, ARE INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE SALES AFTER WE OWN THE ACQUIRED ASSETS FOR MORE THAN 52 WEEKS. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDES NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERING SALES THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED FOR MORE THAN 52 WEEKS. COMPARABLE SALES EXCLUDES PRIOR-YEAR SALES OF PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS THAT WE HAVE EXITED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. FISCAL 2019 INCLUDES 52 WEEKS AND FISCAL 2018 INCLUDED 53  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WEEKS. FOR OUR CALCULATION OF COMPARABLE SALES IN FISCAL 2019, WE WILL COMPARE WEEKS 1 THROUGH 52 IN FISCAL 2019 AGAINST WEEKS 2 THROUGH 53 IN FISCAL 2018. COMPARABLE SALES IS INTENDED ONLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET SALES PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES  INCREASED  3.0%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , CONSISTING OF A  2.0%  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET AND A  1.0%  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS. THE  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE SALES REFLECTED A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXECUTION OF OUR STRATEGIC EFFORTS TO DRIVE AN ENHANCED INTERCONNECTED EXPERIENCE IN BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL WORLDS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COMPARABLE SALES GROWTH AND TOTAL SALES GROWTH IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SHIFT IN OUR FISCAL CALENDAR AS A RESULT OF THE 53  RD  WEEK IN FISCAL 2018.  ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS POSTED POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  EXCEPT FOR  LUMBER  , WHICH WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY COMMODITY PRICE DEFLATION. WE EXPECT LUMBER PRICES TO REMAIN DEPRESSED IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2019. COMPARABLE SALES FOR OUR  APPLIANCES, TOOLS, DE\u0301COR/STORAGE, INDOOR GARDEN, BUILDING MATERIALS, PAINT, OUTDOOR GARDEN, HARDWARE, AND PLUMBING  MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS WERE ABOVE THE COMPANY AVERAGE IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT WAS  $10.4 BILLION  FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF BOTH FISCAL 2019 AND 2018. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, OR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN, WAS  33.8%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  34.0%  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SHRINK, A CHANGE IN PRODUCT MIX, AND HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN EXPENSE.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE COMPOSED OF SG&A AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE  . SG&A WAS  $5.0 BILLION  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  . AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, SG&A WAS  16.4%  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  , DRIVEN BY EXPENSE LEVERAGE RESULTING FROM THE POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES ENVIRONMENT AND CONTINUED EXPENSE CONTROL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  INCREASED  $32 MILLION  TO  $492 MILLION  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  FROM  $460 MILLION  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS  1.6%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  1.5%  FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  , REFLECTING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS, LEVERAGE RESULTING FROM THE POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES ENVIRONMENT, AND TIMING OF ASSET ADDITIONS.  INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.  INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, WAS  $283 MILLION  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  $246 MILLION  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS  0.9%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  AND  0.8%  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  , DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE RESULTING FROM HIGHER DEBT BALANCES.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  OUR COMBINED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS  24.6%  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  24.7%  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . THE DECREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO STOCK COMPENSATION AND THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF CERTAIN STATE TAX SETTLEMENTS.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE  $3.17  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  $3.05  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FISCAL  2019  AND FISCAL  2018  SIX  MONTH COMPARISONS  SIX MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 4,  2019  JULY 29,  2018  DOLLARS IN MILLIONS  $% OF  NET SALES  $% OF  NET SALES  NET SALES  $57,220  $55,410  GROSS PROFIT  19,449  34.0%  18,982  34.3%  OPERATING EXPENSES.

HOWEVER, THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED GAAP MEASURES. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED HEREIN MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILAR MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL.  WE BELIEVE ROIC IS MEANINGFUL FOR INVESTORS AND MANAGEMENT BECAUSE IT MEASURES HOW EFFECTIVELY WE DEPLOY OUR CAPITAL BASE. WE DEFINE ROIC AS NOPAT, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, FOR THE MOST RECENT TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD, DIVIDED BY AVERAGE DEBT AND EQUITY. WE DEFINE AVERAGE DEBT AND EQUITY AS THE AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND ENDING LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING CURRENT INSTALLMENTS) AND EQUITY FOR THE MOST RECENT TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE CALCULATION OF ROIC, TOGETHER WITH A RECONCILIATION OF NOPAT TO NET EARNINGS (THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE), FOLLOWS.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  FOR INFORMATION ON ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT HAVE IMPACTED OR ARE EXPECTED TO MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS, SEE  NOTE 1  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  AT  AUGUST 4, 2019  , WE HAD  $2.5 BILLION  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, OF WHICH  $1.9 BILLION  WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH POSITION, ACCESS TO THE LONG-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, AND FUNDS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT NOT ONLY FOR OUR OPERATING REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO TO ENABLE US TO COMPLETE OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS AND FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SHARE REPURCHASES, AND ANY REQUIRED LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL FISCAL YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING.  AS WE CONTINUE OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS, WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY  $2.7 BILLION  IN FISCAL  2019.  DEBT AND DERIVATIVES  WE HAVE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION. ALL OF OUR SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  WERE UNDER THESE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS, AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME WAS  $2.1 BILLION  . IN CONNECTION WITH THESE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITIES WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO $3.0 BILLION, WHICH CONSIST OF A FIVE-YEAR $2.0 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN DECEMBER 2022 AND A 364-DAY $1.0 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN DECEMBER 2019. AT  AUGUST 4, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITIES, AND NONE ARE EXPECTED TO IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES. AT  AUGUST 4, 2019  , THERE WERE  NO  BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS. WE ALSO ISSUE SENIOR NOTES FROM TIME TO TIME AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY.  WE USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES ON CERTAIN LONG-TERM DEBT. SEE  NOTE 4  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  SHARE REPURCHASES  IN FEBRUARY 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW $15.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT REPLACED THE PREVIOUS AUTHORIZATION. IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , WE HAD CASH PAYMENTS OF  $2.6 BILLION  FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOWS SUMMARY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS PROVIDES US WITH A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS RESULT PRIMARILY FROM CASH RECEIVED FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, OFFSET BY CASH PAYMENTS WE MAKE FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, OPERATIONS, AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  CASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL. WORKING CAPITAL AT ANY SPECIFIC POINT IN TIME IS SUBJECT TO MANY VARIABLES, INCLUDING SEASONALITY, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND CATEGORY EXPANSION, THE TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS, VENDOR PAYMENT TERMS, AND FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $590 MILLION  IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  AND WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NET CASH INFLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL AND AN INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS. THE INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  WAS DUE TO THE POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES ENVIRONMENT AND EXPENSE LEVERAGE.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FROM THE CONTINUATION OF OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN OUR BUSINESS OF  $1.2 BILLION  DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  $1.1 BILLION  OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED.  \u2022  $3.0 BILLION  OF CASH DIVIDENDS PAID,  $2.6 BILLION  OF SHARE REPURCHASES,  $1.3 BILLION  OF NET REPAYMENTS OF SHORT-TERM DEBT, AND  $1.0 BILLION  OF NET REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  $1.4 BILLION  OF NET PROCEEDS FROM LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , AND  \u2022  $3.1 BILLION  OF SHARE REPURCHASES,  $2.4 BILLION  OF CASH DIVIDENDS PAID, AND  $1.6 BILLION  OF NET REPAYMENTS OF SHORT-TERM DEBT IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018.

FISCAL YEAR  FISCAL 2019 IS DEFINED AS THE 52-WEEK YEAR ENDING FEBRUARY 1, 2020. FISCAL 2018 IS DEFINED AS THE 52-WEEK YEAR ENDING FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  STORE OPENINGS, CLOSINGS, AND RELOCATIONS  DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, WE OPENED 27 NEW STORES, INCLUSIVE OF SEVEN RELOCATIONS, AND CLOSED FOUR STORES, EXCLUSIVE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED RELOCATIONS, BRINGING OUR STORE COUNT AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019 TO 691 STORES, INCLUSIVE OF AN INTERNET STORE.  ONGOING INITIATIVES FOR FISCAL 2019  WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON A NUMBER OF ONGOING INITIATIVES AIMED AT INCREASING OUR OVERALL PROFITABILITY BY IMPROVING OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES TRENDS, INCREASING TOTAL SALES GROWTH AND REDUCING EXPENSES. THESE INITIATIVES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.  \u2022  DRIVING COMPARABLE STORE SALES GROWTH.  WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE COMPARABLE STORE SALES THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES.  \u2022  CONTINUING TO ENHANCE EXECUTION OF THE OFF-PRICE MODEL.  WE PLAN TO DRIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES BY FOCUSING ON PRODUCT FRESHNESS TO ENSURE THAT WE CONSISTENTLY DELIVER NEWNESS TO THE SELLING FLOORS. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL RESULT IN FASTER INVENTORY TURNOVER. WE MAINTAIN OUR ABILITY TO LEVERAGE OUR PACK-AND-HOLD PROGRAM, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TERRIFIC BUYS OF EITHER HIGHLY DESIRABLE BRANDED PRODUCT OR KEY SEASONAL MERCHANDISE FOR THE NEXT YEAR. WHILE THE AMOUNT OF GOODS WE PURCHASE ON PACK-AND-HOLD IS PURELY BASED ON THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE MARKETPLACE, THIS CONTINUES TO BE A GREAT AVENUE TO SOURCE PRODUCT. WE ALSO INTEND TO USE OUR BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS TO IDENTIFY SELL-THROUGH RATES BY PRODUCT, CAPITALIZE ON STRONG PERFORMING CATEGORIES, IDENTIFY AND BUY INTO NEW FASHION TRENDS AND OPPORTUNISTICALLY ACQUIRE PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE.  \u2022  SHARPENING FOCUS ON OUR CORE FEMALE CUSTOMER.  WE HAVE FOCUSED ON BETTER SERVING OUR CORE FEMALE CUSTOMER, A BRAND-CONSCIOUS FASHION ENTHUSIAST, AGED 25-49, WITH AN AVERAGE ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $25,000-$100,000, BY IMPROVING OUR PRODUCT OFFERING, STORE MERCHANDISING AND MARKETING FOCUS ON WOMEN\u2019S READY-TO-WEAR APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES TO CAPTURE INCREMENTAL SALES FROM OUR CORE FEMALE CUSTOMER AND BECOME A DESTINATION FOR HER ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE EFFORTS WILL INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF HER VISITS AND HER AVERAGE SPEND, FURTHER IMPROVING THE COMPARABLE STORE SALES PERFORMANCE IN WOMEN\u2019S CATEGORIES.  \u2022  CONTINUING TO IMPROVE OUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.  WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED THE STORE EXPERIENCE AND EASE OF SHOPPING AT ALL OF OUR STORES BY IMPLEMENTING A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM FOCUSED ON OFFERING MORE BRANDS AND STYLES AND SIMPLIFYING STORE NAVIGATION. WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THIS BY UTILIZING CLEAR WAY-FINDING SIGNS AND DISTINCT PRODUCT SIGNAGE, HIGHLIGHTING KEY BRANDS AND NEW ARRIVALS, IMPROVING ORGANIZATION OF THE FLOOR SPACE, REDUCING RACK DENSITY, FACILITATING QUICKER CHECKOUTS AND DELIVERING BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE HAVE MADE PARTICULAR IMPROVEMENTS IN PRODUCT SIZE VISIBILITY, QUEUING AND FITTING ROOMS. TO ENSURE CONSISTENT EXECUTION OF OUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE PRIORITIES, WE HAVE IMPROVED OUR STORE ASSOCIATE TRAINING AND REORGANIZED AND STRENGTHENED OUR FIELD MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION. OUR MUCH IMPROVED STORE EXPERIENCE CONTINUES TO RESONATE WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. WE CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR ONLINE CUSTOMER SURVEY TO PROVIDE MORE ACTIONABLE CUSTOMER FEEDBACK TO STORES. STORES DEVELOP ACTION PLANS TO ADDRESS CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AREAS OF FOCUS. STORE MANAGERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO REVIEW IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS, AND REACT ACCORDINGLY.  \u2022  INCREASING OUR SALES THROUGH E-COMMERCE.  WE HAVE BEEN SELLING TO OUR CUSTOMERS ONLINE FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. WE PLAN TO LEVERAGE THIS HERITAGE AND CONTINUE TO UTILIZE E-COMMERCE STRATEGIES OFFERING MERCHANDISE TO OUR CUSTOMERS WHILE DRIVING INCREMENTAL TRAFFIC TO OUR STORES.  \u2022  ENHANCING EXISTING CATEGORIES AND INTRODUCING NEW CATEGORIES.  WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF CERTAIN EXISTING CATEGORIES SUCH AS LADIES\u2019 APPAREL, CHILDREN\u2019S PRODUCTS, BATH AND COSMETIC MERCHANDISE, HOUSEWARES, DE\u0301COR FOR THE HOME AND BEAUTY AS WE CONTINUE TO DE-WEATHER OUR BUSINESS, AND MAINTAIN THE FLEXIBILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW CATEGORIES.  22  \u2022  PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD.  WE HAVE PILOTED A NEW PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN ROLLED OUT TO  ALL OUR STORES IN THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES  , WITH PLANS TO BRING THE PROGRAM TO  OUR PUERTO RICO  STORES  AND OUR E-COMMERCE SITE  . WE BELIEVE THIS PROGRAM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DEEPEN CUSTOMER LOYALTY, INFORM CUSTOMER CONTACT STRATEGIES, AND DRIVE INCREASES IN TRIP FREQUENCY AND TRANSACTION SIZE.  \u2022  EXPANDING AND ENHANCING OUR RETAIL STORE BASE.  WE INTEND TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE OUR RETAIL STORE BASE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES.  \u2022  ADHERING TO A MARKET FOCUSED AND FINANCIALLY DISCIPLINED REAL ESTATE STRATEGY.  WE HAVE GROWN OUR STORE BASE CONSISTENTLY SINCE OUR FOUNDING IN 1972, DEVELOPING MORE THAN 99% OF OUR STORES ORGANICALLY. WE BELIEVE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND OUR RETAIL STORE BASE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS MARKET OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ALLOW US TO REACH 1,000 STORES OVER THE LONG-TERM. OUR GOAL IS TO OPEN APPROXIMATELY 50 NET NEW STORES DURING FISCAL 2019.  \u2022  MAINTAINING FOCUS ON UNIT ECONOMICS AND RETURNS.  WE HAVE ADOPTED A MARKET FOCUSED APPROACH TO NEW STORE OPENINGS WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON MAXIMIZING SALES WHILE ACHIEVING ATTRACTIVE UNIT ECONOMICS AND RETURNS. BY FOCUSING ON OPENING STORES WITH ATTRACTIVE UNIT ECONOMICS, WE ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE ATTRACTIVE RETURNS ON CAPITAL AND CONTINUE TO GROW OUR MARGINS. WE BELIEVE THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO REDUCE OUR COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY, WE WILL BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF OUR STORES WHILE CONTINUING TO MAINTAIN OUR BROAD ASSORTMENT.  \u2022  ENHANCING THE STORE EXPERIENCE THROUGH STORE REMODELS AND RELOCATIONS.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN STORE REMODELS ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS WHERE APPROPRIATE, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE AGE, SALES AND PROFITABILITY OF A STORE, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT TO THE CUSTOMER SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. IN OUR REMODELED STORES, WE HAVE TYPICALLY INCORPORATED NEW FLOORING, PAINTING, LIGHTING AND GRAPHICS, RELOCATED OUR FITTING ROOMS TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTIVE SELLING SPACE, ADDED NEW DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS HOME AND ACCESSORIES AND MADE VARIOUS OTHER IMPROVEMENTS AS APPROPRIATE BY LOCATION.  \u2022  ENHANCING OPERATING MARGINS.  WE INTEND TO INCREASE OUR OPERATING MARGINS THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES.  \u2022  OPTIMIZE MARKDOWNS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MARKDOWN SYSTEM ALLOWS US TO MAXIMIZE SALES AND GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS BASED ON FORWARD-LOOKING SALES FORECASTS, SELL-THROUGH TARGETS, AND EXIT DATES. THIS ALLOWS US TO OPTIMIZE MARKDOWNS AT THE STYLE AND COLOR LEVEL BY STORE CLUSTER.  \u2022  ENHANCE PURCHASING POWER.  WE BELIEVE THAT INCREASING OUR STORE FOOTPRINT AND EXPANDING OUR WEST COAST BUYING OFFICE PROVIDES US WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO CAPTURE INCREMENTAL BUYING OPPORTUNITIES AND REALIZE ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN OUR MERCHANDISING AND NON-MERCHANDISING PURCHASING ACTIVITIES.  \u2022  DRIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE OUR GROWING SALES OVER THE FIXED COSTS OF OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR CORPORATE AND IN-STORE OPERATIONS.  UNCERTAINTIES AND CHALLENGES  AS WE STRIVE TO INCREASE PROFITABILITY THROUGH ACHIEVING POSITIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES AND LEVERAGING PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE IN-STORE EXPERIENCE, MORE EFFICIENT MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTS FROM THE VENDORS TO THE SELLING FLOORS, AND MODIFYING OUR MARKETING PLANS TO INCREASE OUR CORE CUSTOMER BASE AND INCREASE OUR SHARE OF OUR CURRENT CUSTOMERS\u2019 SPENDING, THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES AND CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AS AN OFF-PRICE RETAILER OF APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES FOR MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND HOME FURNISHINGS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES OR INCOME.  SEASONALITY OF SALES AND WEATHER CONDITIONS  . OUR SALES, LIKE MOST OTHER RETAILERS, ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL INFLUENCES, WITH THE MAJORITY OF OUR SALES AND NET INCOME DERIVED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, WHICH INCLUDES THE BACK-TO-SCHOOL AND HOLIDAY SEASONS.  WEATHER CONTINUES TO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE SALE OF OUR CLOTHING. GENERALLY, OUR SALES ARE HIGHER IF THE WEATHER IS COLD DURING THE FALL AND WARM DURING THE EARLY SPRING. SALES OF COLD WEATHER CLOTHING ARE INCREASED BY EARLY COLD WEATHER DURING THE FALL, WHILE SALES OF WARM WEATHER CLOTHING ARE IMPROVED BY EARLY WARM WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE SPRING. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DIVERSIFIED OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WE BELIEVE TRAFFIC TO OUR STORES IS STILL DRIVEN, IN PART, BY WEATHER PATTERNS.  GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS, INCLUDING SPENDING FOR THE MERCHANDISE THAT WE SELL, ARE AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PREVAILING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INFLATION, LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT, SALARIES AND WAGE RATES, PREVAILING  23  INTEREST RATES, HOUSING COSTS, ENERGY COSTS, COMMODITIES PRICING, INCOME TAX RATES AND POLICIES, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND CONSUMER PERCEPTION OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, CONSUMER PURCHASING PATTERNS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY CONSUMERS\u2019 DISPOSABLE INCOME, CREDIT AVAILABILITY AND DEBT LEVELS.  A SLOWDOWN IN THE U.S. ECONOMY, AN UNCERTAIN GLOBAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK OR A CREDIT CRISIS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS RESULTING IN LOWER NET SALES AND PROFITS THAN EXPECTED ON A QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL BASIS. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SITUATION. OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN AREAS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TAXES AND HEALTHCARE. ONGOING INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS COULD HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR INCOME AND AN INDIRECT IMPACT ON CONSUMER PRICES. THE OUTBREAK OR ESCALATION OF WAR, OR THE OCCURRENCE OF TERRORIST ACTS OR OTHER HOSTILITIES IN OR AFFECTING THE U.S., COULD LEAD TO A DECREASE IN SPENDING BY CONSUMERS. IN ADDITION, NATURAL DISASTERS, INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AND ACTS OF WAR IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DISRUPTING SUPPLIES AND RAISING PRICES GLOBALLY WHICH, IN TURN, MAY HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE WORLD AND U.S. ECONOMIES AND LEAD TO A DOWNTURN IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND SPENDING.  WE CLOSELY MONITOR OUR NET SALES, GROSS MARGIN AND EXPENSES. WE HAVE PERFORMED SCENARIO PLANNING SUCH THAT IF OUR NET SALES DECLINE, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED VARIABLE COSTS THAT COULD BE REDUCED TO PARTIALLY MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THESE DECLINES. IF WE WERE TO EXPERIENCE ADVERSE ECONOMIC TRENDS AND/OR IF OUR EFFORTS TO COUNTERACT THE IMPACTS OF THESE TRENDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVE, THERE COULD BE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND POSITION IN FUTURE FISCAL PERIODS.  COMPETITION AND MARGIN PRESSURE.  WE BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, WE MUST CONTINUE TO OFFER BRAND-NAME MERCHANDISE AT A DISCOUNT TO PRICES OFFERED BY OTHER RETAILERS AS WELL AS AN ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE THAT IS APPEALING TO OUR CUSTOMERS.  THE U.S. RETAIL APPAREL AND HOME FURNISHINGS MARKETS ARE HIGHLY FRAGMENTED AND COMPETITIVE. WE COMPETE FOR BUSINESS WITH DEPARTMENT STORES, OFF-PRICE RETAILERS, INTERNET RETAILERS, SPECIALTY STORES, DISCOUNT STORES, WHOLESALE CLUBS, AND OUTLET STORES AS WELL AS WITH C  ERTAIN TRADITIONAL, FULL-PRICE RETAIL CHAINS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED OFF-PRICE CONCEPTS  . AT VARIOUS TIMES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, TRADITIONAL FULL-PRICE DEPARTMENT STORE CHAINS AND SPECIALTY SHOPS OFFER BRAND-NAME MERCHANDISE AT SUBSTANTIAL MARKDOWNS, WHICH CAN RESULT IN PRICES APPROXIMATING THOSE OFFERED BY US AT OUR BURLINGTON STORES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT COMPETITION WILL INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. THEREFORE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO DIFFERENTIATE OUR STORES FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS.  THE U.S. RETAIL INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO FACE INCREASED PRESSURE ON MARGINS AS OVERALL CHALLENGING RETAIL CONDITIONS HAVE LED CONSUMERS TO BE MORE VALUE CONSCIOUS. OUR \u201cOPEN TO BUY\u201d PARADIGM, UNDER WHICH WE PURCHASE BOTH PRE-SEASON AND IN-SEASON MERCHANDISE, ALLOWS US THE FLEXIBILITY TO PURCHASE LESS PRE-SEASON WITH THE BALANCE PURCHASED IN-SEASON AND OPPORTUNISTICALLY. IT ALSO PROVIDES US WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO SHIFT PURCHASES BETWEEN SUPPLIERS AND CATEGORIES. THIS ENABLES US TO OBTAIN BETTER TERMS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, WHICH WE EXPECT TO HELP OFFSET ANY RISING COSTS OF GOODS.  KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES  WE CONSIDER NUMEROUS FACTORS IN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE. KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES USED BY MANAGEMENT INCLUDE NET INCOME, ADJUSTED NET INCOME, ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBIT, COMPARABLE STORE SALES, GROSS MARGIN, INVENTORY, STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES AND LIQUIDITY.  NET INCOME  . WE EARNED NET INCOME OF $84.6 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH $71.0 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018. WE EARNED NET INCOME OF $162.3 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH $153.5 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR INCREASED GROSS MARGIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. REFER TO THE SECTION BELOW ENTITLED \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION.  ADJUSTED NET INCOME, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBIT  : ADJUSTED NET INCOME, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBIT ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES OF OUR PERFORMANCE.  WE DEFINE ADJUSTED NET INCOME AS NET INCOME, EXCLUSIVE OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, IF APPLICABLE: (I) NET FAVORABLE LEASE COST; (II) COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS; (III) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; (IV) IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; AND (V) OTHER UNUSUAL, NON-RECURRING OR EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES, LOSSES, CHARGES OR GAINS, ALL OF WHICH ARE TAX EFFECTED TO ARRIVE AT ADJUSTED NET INCOME.  WE DEFINE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS NET INCOME, EXCLUSIVE OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, IF APPLICABLE: (I) INTEREST EXPENSE; (II) INTEREST INCOME; (III) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; (IV) INCOME TAX EXPENSE; (V) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION; (VI) IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; (VII) COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS; AND (VIII) OTHER UNUSUAL, NON-RECURRING OR EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES, LOSSES, CHARGES OR GAINS.  24  WE DEFINE  ADJUSTED EBIT  AS NET INCOME, EXCLUSIVE OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, IF APPLICABLE: (I) INTEREST EXPENSE; (II) INTEREST INCOME; (III) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; (IV) INCOME TAX EXPENSE; (V) IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; (VI) NET FAVORABLE LEASE COST  S  ; (VII) COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS; AND (VIII) OTHER UNUSUAL, NON-RECURRING OR EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES, LOSSES, CHARGES OR GAINS.  WE PRESENT ADJUSTED NET INCOME, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBIT, BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY ARE USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES IN EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS AND PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY INTO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN PARTICULAR, WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMS THAT MAY VARY SUBSTANTIALLY IN FREQUENCY AND MAGNITUDE FROM WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE OUR CORE OPERATING RESULTS ARE USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES THAT ASSIST IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE EARNINGS AND LEVERAGE SALES, AND TO MORE READILY COMPARE CORE OPERATING RESULTS BETWEEN PAST AND FUTURE PERIODS.  ADJUSTED NET INCOME HAS LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED EITHER IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR OTHER DATA PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. AMONG OTHER LIMITATIONS, ADJUSTED NET INCOME DOES NOT REFLECT THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, NET OF THEIR TAX EFFECT.  \u2022  FAVORABLE LEASE COSTS;  \u2022  COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS;  \u2022  LOSSES ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT;  \u2022  IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON LONG-LIVED ASSETS; AND  \u2022  OTHER UNUSUAL, NON-RECURRING OR EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES, LOSSES, CHARGES OR GAINS.  DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, ADJUSTED NET INCOME IMPROVED $12.6 MILLION TO $91.4 MILLION AND $11.1 MILLION TO $176.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

COMPARABLE STORE SALES.  COMPARABLE STORE SALES MEASURE PERFORMANCE OF A STORE DURING THE CURRENT REPORTING PERIOD AGAINST THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SAME STORE IN THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THE METHOD OF CALCULATING COMPARABLE STORE SALES VARIES ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, OUR DEFINITION OF COMPARABLE STORE SALES MAY DIFFER FROM OTHER RETAILERS.  WE DEFINE COMPARABLE STORE SALES AS MERCHANDISE SALES OF THOSE STORES, INCLUDING OUR ONLINE STORE, COMMENCING ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FISCAL MONTH ONE YEAR AFTER THE END OF THEIR GRAND OPENING ACTIVITIES, WHICH NORMALLY CONCLUDE WITHIN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF OPERATIONS. IF A STORE IS CLOSED FOR SEVEN OR MORE DAYS DURING A MONTH, OUR POLICY IS TO REMOVE THAT STORE FROM OUR CALCULATION OF COMPARABLE STORES SALES FOR ANY SUCH MONTH, AS WELL AS DURING THE MONTH(S) OF THEIR GRAND RE-OPENING ACTIVITIES. THE INCREASE IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES WAS AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  SIX MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  3.8%  1.9%  AUGUST 4, 2018  2.9%  3.8%  VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECT COMPARABLE STORE SALES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WEATHER CONDITIONS, CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE TIMING OF OUR RELEASES OF NEW MERCHANDISE AND PROMOTIONAL EVENTS, THE GENERAL RETAIL SALES ENVIRONMENT, CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND BUYING TRENDS, CHANGES IN SALES MIX AMONG DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, COMPETITION, AND THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING PROGRAMS.  GROSS MARGIN.  GROSS MARGIN IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NET SALES AND THE COST OF SALES. OUR COST OF SALES AND GROSS MARGIN MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF OTHER ENTITIES, SINCE SOME ENTITIES MAY INCLUDE ALL OF THE COSTS RELATED TO THEIR BUYING AND DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS, CERTAIN STORE-RELATED COSTS AND OTHER COSTS, IN COST OF SALES. WE INCLUDE CERTAIN OF THESE COSTS IN THE LINE ITEMS \u201cSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\u201d AND \u201cDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\u201d IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. WE INCLUDE IN OUR \u201cCOST OF SALES\u201d LINE ITEM ALL COSTS OF MERCHANDISE (NET OF PURCHASE DISCOUNTS AND CERTAIN VENDOR ALLOWANCES), INBOUND FREIGHT, DISTRIBUTION CENTER OUTBOUND FREIGHT AND CERTAIN MERCHANDISE ACQUISITION COSTS, PRIMARILY COMMISSIONS AND IMPORT FEES. GROSS  27  MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  REMAINED CONSISTENT AT  41.4%  DURING THE  THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018.  I  NCREASED MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS  . PRODUCT SOURCING COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES,  IMPROVED APPROXIMATELY 10 BASIS POINTS  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES DECREASED APPROXIMATELY  10  BASIS POINTS TO  41.2%  DURING  THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  , DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  INCREASED MERCHANDISE MARGIN  . PRODUCT SOURCING COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES,  REMAINED FLAT  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  INVENTORY.  INVENTORY AT AUGUST 3, 2019 DECREASED TO $823.8 MILLION COMPARED WITH $843.9 MILLION AT AUGUST 4, 2018. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN APPROXIMATELY 7% DECREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN SHORT STAY INVENTORY. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR 40 NET NEW STORES OPENED FROM AUGUST 4, 2018 THROUGH AUGUST 3, 2019 AND OUR PACK-AND-HOLD INVENTORY LEVELS, WHICH WERE 29% OF TOTAL INVENTORY AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO 26% AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  INVENTORY AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019 WAS $954.2 MILLION. THE DECREASE IN INVENTORY IS PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR HIGH STARTING POSITION AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019, RESULTING FROM THE ACCELERATION OF RECEIPTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INVENTORY REQUIRED FOR OUR 16 NET NEW STORES OPENED DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019.  IN ORDER TO BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND MAXIMIZE SALES, WE CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR MERCHANDISING MIX AND INVENTORY LEVELS WITHIN OUR STORES. BY APPROPRIATELY MANAGING OUR INVENTORIES, WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO DELIVER A CONTINUAL FLOW OF FRESH MERCHANDISE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARD MORE PRODUCTIVE INVENTORIES BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF CURRENT INVENTORY AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL INVENTORY.  INVENTORY TURNOVER AND COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER ARE PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT INDICATE HOW EFFICIENTLY INVENTORY IS BOUGHT AND SOLD. THEY EACH MEASURE THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT WE OWN OUR INVENTORY.  INVENTORY TURNOVER IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING COST OF GOODS SOLD BY THE 13 MONTH AVERAGE COST VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY FOR THE PERIOD BEING MEASURED. OUR INVENTORY TURNOVER RATE DECLINED APPROXIMATELY  7% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING COMPARABLE STORE SALES BY THE AVERAGE COMPARABLE STORE RETAIL VALUE OF INVENTORY FOR THE PERIOD BEING MEASURED. THE COMPARABLE STORE RETAIL VALUE OF INVENTORIES IS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE ORIGINAL SALES PRICE OF ITEMS ON HAND REDUCED BY RETAIL REDUCTIONS (WHICH INCLUDE SALES, MARKDOWNS, AN ESTIMATED SHORTAGE ADJUSTMENT AND EMPLOYEE DISCOUNTS) FOR OUR COMPARABLE STORES. THE CALCULATION IS BASED ON A ROLLING 13 MONTH AVERAGE OF INVENTORY (AT ESTIMATED RETAIL VALUE) AND THE LAST 12 MONTHS\u2019 COMPARABLE STORE SALES. OUR COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER RATE IMPROVED APPROXIMATELY  2% DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INVENTORY TURNOVER AND COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE LATTER NOT INCLUDING DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND WAREHOUSE INVENTORY OR INVENTORY AT NEW AND NON-COMPARABLE STORES. INVENTORY HELD AT OUR WAREHOUSES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS INCLUDES MERCHANDISE BEING READIED FOR SHIPMENT TO OUR STORES AND PACK-AND-HOLD INVENTORY ACQUIRED OPPORTUNISTICALLY FOR FUTURE STORE RELEASE. THE MAGNITUDE OF PACK-AND-HOLD INVENTORY, AT ANY ONE POINT IN TIME, IS DEPENDENT ON THE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE MARKETPLACE.  WE PRESENT INVENTORY TURNOVER, BECAUSE IT DEMONSTRATES HOW EFFECTIVE WE ARE AT MANAGING OUR INVENTORY. WE PRESENT COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER AS WE BELIEVE THIS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL METRIC IN EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR MERCHANDISING EFFORTS, AS A FASTER COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER GENERALLY LEADS TO REDUCED MARKDOWNS AND MORE FRESH MERCHANDISE IN OUR STORES.  STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR PAYROLL IN ACCORDANCE WITH INCREASES OR DECREASES IN NET SALES. THE METHOD OF CALCULATING STORE PAYROLL VARIES ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, OUR STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES MAY DIFFER FROM OTHER RETAILERS. WE DEFINE STORE PAYROLL AS REGULAR AND OVERTIME PAYROLL FOR ALL STORE PERSONNEL AS WELL AS REGIONAL AND TERRITORY PERSONNEL, EXCLUSIVE OF PAYROLL CHARGES RELATED TO CORPORATE AND WAREHOUSE EMPLOYEES. STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS 9.0% AND 8.9% DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH 9.1% AND 8.8%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018.  LIQUIDITY.  LIQUIDITY MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH. MANAGEMENT MEASURES LIQUIDITY THROUGH CASH FLOW, WHICH IS THE MEASURE OF CASH GENERATED FROM OR USED IN OPERATING, FINANCING, AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, INCLUDING RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, DECREASED $15.1 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, COMPARED WITH A DECREASE  28  OF $49.6  MILLION DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  . REFER TO THE SECTION BELOW ENTITLED \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH CERTAIN ITEMS IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 AND THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018.

COST OF SALES  COST OF SALES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES REMAINED CONSISTENT AT 58.6% DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED MERCHANDISE MARGIN, WHICH WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS. PRODUCT SOURCING COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, IMPROVED APPROXIMATELY 10 BASIS POINTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES. ON A DOLLAR BASIS, COST OF SALES INCREASED $92.9 MILLION, OR 10.6%, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR OVERALL INCREASE IN SALES.  29  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 10 BASIS POINTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.

THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 10 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENT IN STORE OCCUPANCY COSTS, A 10 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCT SOURCING COSTS, A 10 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENT IN STORE PAYROLL, AND A 10 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENT IN OUR NATIONAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING AND DIRECT MARKETING EFFORTS, AS A RESULT OF OUR PROFIT IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE DEPRECIATION OF FIXED ASSETS AMOUNTED TO $52.3 MILLION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH $56.9 MILLION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE RECLASSIFICATION OF FAVORABLE LEASE COST FROM DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE TO SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING ASU 2016-02, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR NEW AND NON-COMPARABLE STORES.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE IMPROVED $1.1 MILLION TO $13.4 MILLION. THE IMPROVEMENT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE $150 MILLION PAYDOWN AND REPRICING OF OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY DURING FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AVERAGE BORROWINGS AND A HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON OUR ABL LINE OF CREDIT.  OUR AVERAGE INTEREST RATES AND AVERAGE BALANCES RELATED TO OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY AND OUR ABL LINE OF CREDIT, FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE TABLE BELOW.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS $11.2 MILLION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH $8.3 MILLION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS 11.6% COMPARED WITH 10.5% DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THE LOWER TAX RATE IN THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A ONE TIME DEFERRED TAX REVALUATION DUE TO CHANGES IN NEW JERSEY TAX LAW ENACTED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  30  AT THE END OF EACH INTERIM PERIOD WE ARE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE BEST ESTIMATE OF OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND THEN APPLY THAT RATE IN PROVIDING FOR INCOME TAXES ON A CURRENT YEAR-TO-DATE (INTERIM PERIOD) BASIS. USE OF THIS METHODOLOGY DURING  THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  RESULTED IN AN ANNUAL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF APPROXIMATELY  25% (BEFORE DISCR  ETE ITEMS) AS OUR BEST ESTIMATE. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 OF APPROXIMATELY 25% (BEFORE DISCRETE ITEMS).  NET INCOME  WE EARNED NET INCOME OF $84.6 MILLION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH $71.0 MILLION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THIS IMPROVEMENT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 WAS 14.4% COMPARED WITH 14.3% DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018.  NET INCOME  WE EARNED NET INCOME OF $162.3 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH $153.5 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018. THIS IMPROVEMENT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR ABILITY TO SATISFY INTEREST PAYMENT AND FUTURE PRINCIPAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS ON OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE WHICH, IN TURN, IS SUBJECT TO PREVAILING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TO FINANCIAL, BUSINESS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IF WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW TO SERVICE INTEREST PAYMENT AND FUTURE PRINCIPAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS ON OUR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS AND IF WE CANNOT BORROW OR OBTAIN EQUITY FINANCING TO SATISFY THOSE OBLIGATIONS, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE CANNOT BE ASSURED THAT ANY REPLACEMENT BORROWING OR EQUITY FINANCING COULD BE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ON TERMS SIMILAR TO OUR CURRENT FINANCING AGREEMENTS, OR AT ALL.  WE BELIEVE THAT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ALONG WITH OUR EXISTING CASH AND OUR ABL LINE OF CREDIT, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR EXPECTED CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS AND PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AS WELL AS THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO OFFSET DECLINES IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES WITH SAVINGS INITIATIVES IN THE EVENT THAT THE ECONOMY DECLINES.  32  CASH FLOW FOR THE  SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  COMPARED WITH THE  SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  WE USED $15.1 MILLION OF CASH FLOW DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH A USE OF $49.6  MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AMOUNTED TO $229.4 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH $166.3 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018. THE INCREASE IN OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR IMPROVED OPERATING RESULTS AND CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $164.0 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH $125.2 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018. THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO A NEW DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND OUR STORE EXPENDITURES (NEW STORES, REMODELS, AND OTHER STORE EXPENDITURES).  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $80.5 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 COMPARED WITH A USE OF $90.7 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018. THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN THE NET BORROWINGS ON OUR DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF SHARE REPURCHASES.  CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL ALSO IMPACT OUR CASH FLOWS. WORKING CAPITAL EQUALS CURRENT ASSETS (EXCLUSIVE OF RESTRICTED CASH) MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES. WE HAD A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AT AUGUST 3, 2019 OF $151.7 MILLION COMPARED WITH WORKING CAPITAL OF $32.0 MILLION AT AUGUST 4, 2018. THE DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-02, WHICH RESULTED IN ADDING A PORTION OF THE NEW LEASE LIABILITY TO CURRENT LIABILITIES, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019 OF $2.3 MILLION.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, CASH SPEND FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, NET OF $23.4 MILLION OF LANDLORD ALLOWANCES, AMOUNTED TO $140.5 MILLION. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL SPEND APPROXIMATELY  $310  MILLION, NET OF APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION OF LANDLORD ALLOWANCES, IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING FISCAL 2019, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $155 MILLION, NET OF THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED LANDLORD ALLOWANCES, FOR STORE EXPENDITURES (NEW STORES, REMODELS AND OTHER STORE EXPENDITURES). IN ADDITION, WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL SPEND APPROXIMATELY $60  MILLION TO SUPPORT OUR SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVES, WITH THE REMAINING CAPITAL USED TO SUPPORT OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER BUSINESS INITIATIVES.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  ON AUGUST 15, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $300 MILLION OF COMMON STOCK, WHICH IS AUTHORIZED TO BE EXECUTED THROUGH AUGUST 2020. THIS REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS FUNDED USING OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND BORROWINGS ON OUR ABL LINE OF CREDIT.  DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, WE REPURCHASED 1,142,202 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR $174.1 MILLION, INCLUSIVE OF COMMISSIONS, UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019, WE HAD $124.3 MILLION REMAINING UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $400 MILLION OF COMMON STOCK, WHICH IS AUTHORIZED TO BE EXECUTED THROUGH AUGUST 2021.  WE ARE AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE, FROM TIME TO TIME, SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK ON THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF STOCK REPURCHASES WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE MARKET CONDITIONS AS WELL AS CORPORATE AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS. OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED, MODIFIED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME AND WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO REPURCHASE ANY AMOUNT OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THE PROGRAM.  DIVIDENDS  WE CURRENTLY DO, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO, RETAIN ALL AVAILABLE FUNDS AND ANY FUTURE EARNINGS TO FUND ALL OF THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, BUSINESS INITIATIVES, AND TO SUPPORT ANY POTENTIAL OPPORTUNISTIC CAPITAL STRUCTURE INITIATIVES. THEREFORE, AT THIS TIME, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE NEAR TERM. OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE LIMITED BY RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS OR MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER THE TERMS OF CURRENT AND ANY FUTURE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR INDEBTEDNESS. ANY FUTURE DETERMINATION TO PAY DIVIDENDS WILL BE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH COVENANTS IN OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR INDEBTEDNESS, AND WILL DEPEND UPON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEEMS RELEVANT.  33  IN ADDITION, SINCE WE ARE A HOLDING COMPANY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS SHOWN ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ARE HELD BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOW AND ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON THE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND THE DISTRIBUTION OR OTHER PAYMENT OF SUCH EARNINGS TO US IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS.  OPERATIONAL GROWTH  DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019, WE OPENED 27 NEW STORES, INCLUSIVE OF SEVEN RELOCATIONS, AND CLOSED FOUR STORES, EXCLUSIVE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED RELOCATIONS, BRINGING OUR STORE COUNT AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019 TO 691 STORES, INCLUSIVE OF AN INTERNET STORE. WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE OUR GROWTH PLANS AND INVEST IN CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT MEET OUR FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. DURING FISCAL 2019, WE PLAN TO OPEN APPROXIMATELY 50 NET NEW STORES,  WHICH INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 75 GROSS NEW STORES, ALONG WITH APPROXIMATELY 25 STORE RELOCATIONS AND CLOSINGS.  WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES BOTH WITHIN OUR CURRENT MARKET AREAS AND IN OTHER REGIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ABILITY TO FIND SATISFACTORY LOCATIONS FOR OUR STORES IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS. THE OPENING OF STORES GENERALLY IS CONTINGENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE AVAILABILITY OF DESIRABLE LOCATIONS WITH SUITABLE STRUCTURES AND THE NEGOTIATION OF ACCEPTABLE LEASE TERMS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND SUITABLE LOCATIONS FOR NEW STORES OR THAT EVEN IF SUCH LOCATIONS ARE FOUND AND ACCEPTABLE LEASE TERMS ARE OBTAINED, WE WILL BE ABLE TO OPEN THE NUMBER OF NEW STORES PRESENTLY PLANNED. ASSUMING THAT APPROPRIATE LOCATIONS ARE IDENTIFIED, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EXECUTE OUR GROWTH STRATEGY WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING OUR CURRENT STORES.  DEBT AND HEDGING  AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019, OUR OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE $957.1 MILLION, INCLUSIVE OF ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT, UNDER OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY AND $96.9 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS ON OUR ABL FACILITY. OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS ALSO INCLUDE $31.5 MILLION OF CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019.  TERM LOAN FACILITY  AT AUGUST 3, 2019, OUR BORROWING RATE RELATED TO THE TERM LOAN FACILITY WAS  4.3%.  ABL LINE OF CREDIT  AT AUGUST 3, 2019, WE HAD $428.6 MILLION AVAILABLE UNDER THE ABL LINE OF CREDIT. THE MAXIMUM BORROWINGS UNDER THE FACILITY DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 AMOUNTED TO $255.0  MILLION. AVERAGE BORROWINGS DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019 AMOUNTED TO $146.7  MILLION AT AN AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 3.7%.  HEDGING  ON DECEMBER 17, 2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT, WHICH WAS DESIGNATED AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE. THIS INTEREST RATE SWAP, WHICH HEDGES $450 MILLION OF OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY, BECAME EFFECTIVE MAY 31, 2019 AND MATURES DECEMBER 29, 2023.  CERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THE COMPANY HAD $1,173.5 MILLION OF PURCHASE COMMITMENTS RELATED TO GOODS THAT WERE NOT RECEIVED AS OF AUGUST 3, 2019. THERE WERE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES REGARDING OUR OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER CURRENT CONTRACTS FROM THOSE INCLUDED IN OUR FISCAL 2018 10-K.  34  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SEVERAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING OUR HISTORICAL AND FUTURE PERFORMANCE AS THESE POLICIES AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT AREAS THAT INVOLVE MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES. THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT (I) THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; (II) THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; AND (III) THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, INVENTORIES, LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL, INSURANCE RESERVES AND INCOME TAXES. HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE MEETS TWO CRITERIA: (1) IT REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS AND (2) THERE WOULD BE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM EITHER USING A DIFFERENT, ALTHOUGH REASONABLE, AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE OF THE ESTIMATE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD OR FROM REASONABLY LIKELY PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATE.  LEASES  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD UPDATE (ASU) 2016-02, \u201cLEASES.\u201d THE STANDARD\u2019S CORE PRINCIPLE IS TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY AMONG ORGANIZATIONS BY RECOGNIZING LEASE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND DISCLOSING KEY INFORMATION ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. WE ADOPTED THIS ASU AS OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2019.  WE APPLIED THE CHANGES FROM THE NEW GUIDANCE AT THE ADOPTION DATE AND RECOGNIZED A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION, AS ALLOWED UNDER ASU 2018-11, \u201cLEASES: TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS.\u201d WE DID NOT ADJUST PRIOR PERIODS. WE MADE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION NOT TO CAPITALIZE LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS. WE ELECTED THE TRANSITION PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS, WHICH ALLOWS US TO CARRY FORWARD FOR OUR EXISTING LEASES: I) THE HISTORICAL LEASE CLASSIFICATION AS EITHER OPERATING OR CAPITAL; II) ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE OR CONTAIN LEASES; AND III) CAPITALIZATION OF INITIAL DIRECT COSTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ELECTED THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS TO NOT SEPARATE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, TO NOT ASSESS WHETHER EXISTING OR EXPIRED LAND EASEMENTS CONTAIN A LEASE, AND TO EMPLOY HINDSIGHT WHEN DETERMINING LEASE TERMS FOR EXISTING LEASES ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION.  ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD ALSO RESULTED IN A CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CERTAIN EXPENSE RECOGNITION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO NET FAVORABLE LEASE COST, AS WELL AS A RECLASSIFICATION OF FAVORABLE LEASE COST FROM \u201cDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\u201d TO \u201cSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\u201d ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019. THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY.  OTHER THAN THE LEASE ACCOUNTING POLICY DISCUSSED ABOVE, OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, \u201cSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,\u201d INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT  THIS REPORT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, ESTIMATES, FORECASTS AND PROJECTIONS ABOUT US, THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND OTHER MATTERS, AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT\u2019S BELIEFS AND ASSUMPTIONS AND OTHER STATEMENTS REGARDING MATTERS THAT ARE NOT HISTORICAL FACTS.

OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. SUCH STATEMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, PROPOSED STORE OPENINGS AND CLOSINGS, PROPOSED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, PROJECTED FINANCING REQUIREMENTS, PROPOSED DEVELOPMENTAL PROJECTS, PROJECTED SALES AND EARNINGS, OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN SELLING MARGINS, AND THE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. ACTUAL EVENTS OR RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS. WHILE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS, FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ESTIMATED BY US INCLUDE: GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ONE OR MORE OF OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND GROWTH PLANS; THE AVAILABILITY OF DESIRABLE STORE LOCATIONS ON SUITABLE TERMS; CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DEMAND; INDUSTRY TRENDS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN BUYING, INVENTORY AND OTHER BUSINESS PRACTICES; COMPETITIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING PRICING AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES OF MAJOR COMPETITORS AND AN INCREASE IN COMPETITION WITHIN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE; THE AVAILABILITY, SELECTION AND PURCHASING OF ATTRACTIVE MERCHANDISE ON FAVORABLE TERMS; IMPORT RISKS, INCLUDING TAX AND TRADE POLICIES, TARIFFS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS; WEATHER PATTERNS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN YEAR-OVER-YEAR TEMPERATURES; OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY; OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS AND EXPENSES;  35  UNFORESEEN CYBER-RELATED PROBLEMS OR ATTACKS; ANY UNFORESEEN MATERIAL LOSS OR CASUALTY; THE EFFECT OF INFLATION; REGULATORY AND TAX CHANGES; OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH EMPLOYEES; THE IMPACT OF CURRENT AND FUTURE LAWS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF SUCH LAWS; TERRORIST ATTACKS, PARTICULARLY ATTACKS ON OR WITHIN MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE; NATURAL AND MAN-MADE DISASTERS, INCLUDING FIRE, SNOW AND ICE STORMS, FLOOD, HAIL, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES; OUR SUBSTANTIAL LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS AND RELATED DEBT-SERVICE OBLIGATIONS; RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY COVENANTS IN OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS; AVAILABILITY OF ADEQUATE FINANCING; OUR DEPENDENCE ON VENDORS FOR OUR MERCHANDISE; DOMESTIC EVENTS AFFECTING THE DELIVERY OF MERCHANDISE TO OUR STORES; EXISTENCE OF ADVERSE LITIGATION; AND OTHER RISKS DISCUSSED FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC).  MANY OF THESE FACTORS ARE BEYOND OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT OR CONTROL. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THESE AND OTHER FACTORS, OUR PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON AS AN INDICATION OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION ALSO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUBSEQUENT WRITTEN OR ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED BY US OR PERSONS ACTING ON OUR BEHALF. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE OR REVISE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW. IN LIGHT OF THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, THE FORWARD-LOOKING EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES DISCUSSED IN THIS REPORT MIGHT NOT OCCUR. FURTHERMORE, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS, EVENTS, LEVELS OF ACTIVITY, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS  (  SECOND  QUARTER) AND  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS  (  SIX  MONTHS) ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  COMPARED TO  THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS  (  SECOND  QUARTER) AND  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS  (  SIX  MONTHS) ENDED  AUGUST 4, 2018  OVERVIEW  WE ARE THE LEADING OFF-PRICE APPAREL AND HOME FASHIONS RETAILER IN THE U.S. AND WORLDWIDE. WE SELL A RAPIDLY CHANGING ASSORTMENT OF APPAREL, HOME FASHIONS AND OTHER MERCHANDISE AT PRICES GENERALLY 20% TO 60% BELOW FULL-PRICE RETAILERS\u2019 (INCLUDING DEPARTMENT, SPECIALTY AND MAJOR ONLINE RETAILERS) REGULAR PRICES ON COMPARABLE MERCHANDISE, EVERY DAY. WE OPERATE OVER  4,400  STORES THROUGH OUR FOUR MAIN SEGMENTS: IN THE U.S., MARMAXX (WHICH OPERATES T.J. MAXX, MARSHALLS AND TJMAXX.COM) AND HOMEGOODS (WHICH OPERATES HOMEGOODS AND HOMESENSE); TJX CANADA (WHICH OPERATES WINNERS, HOMESENSE AND MARSHALLS IN CANADA); AND TJX INTERNATIONAL (WHICH OPERATES T.K.

IN ADDITION TO OUR FOUR MAIN SEGMENTS, SIERRA OPERATES SIERRA.COM AND RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. THE RESULTS OF SIERRA ARE INCLUDED IN THE MARMAXX SEGMENT.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  .  \u2013  NET SALES  INCREASE  D  5%  TO  $9.8 BILLION  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020  OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S  SECOND  QUARTER SALES OF  $9.3 BILLION  . AS OF  AUGUST 3, 2019  , THE NUMBER OF STORES IN OPERATION  INCREASE  D  5%  AND SELLING SQUARE FOOTAGE  INCREASE  D  4%  COMPARED TO THE END OF THE FISCAL  2019  SECOND  QUARTER.  \u2013  COMP SALES  INCREASE  D  2%  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020  OVER AN  INCREASE  OF  6%  FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR ENDED  AUGUST 4, 2018  . CUSTOMER TRAFFIC WAS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THE COMP SALES  INCREASE  AND WAS UP AT ALL FOUR MAJOR SEGMENTS.  \u2013  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020  WERE  $0.62  VERSUS  $0.58  PER SHARE IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  \u2013  OUR PRE-TAX MARGIN (THE RATIO OF PRE-TAX INCOME TO NET SALES) FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  10.4%  , A  0.2  PERCENTAGE POINT  DECREASE  COMPARED WITH  10.6%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  \u2013  OUR COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, RATIO FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  71.8%  , A  0.7  PERCENTAGE POINT  INCREASE  COMPARED WITH  71.1%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  \u2013  OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cSG&A\u201d) EXPENSE RATIO FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  17.7%  , A  0.5  PERCENTAGE POINT  DECREASE  COMPARED WITH  18.2%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  \u2013  OUR AVERAGE PER STORE INVENTORIES, INCLUDING INVENTORY ON HAND AT OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS (WHICH EXCLUDES INVENTORY IN TRANSIT) AND EXCLUDING OUR E-COMMERCE SITES AND SIERRA STORES, WERE  UP  6%  ON A REPORTED BASIS AND  7%  ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS AT THE END OF THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  AS COMPARED TO A  5%  INCREASE  IN AVERAGE PER STORE INVENTORIES ON A REPORTED BASIS AND A  6%  INCREASE  ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  \u2013  DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020  , WE RETURNED  $579  MILLION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  IMPACT OF BREXIT  THE U.K\u2019S DECISION TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION (\u201cEU\u201d), COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS \u201cBREXIT\u201d, REMAINS UNSETTLED. SHOULD THE U.K. EXIT THE EU, THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE OUTCOMES EACH OF WHICH CREATES RISKS FOR TJX, ESPECIALLY IN OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS. CURRENT U.K. LAW STATES THAT THE U.K. WILL LEAVE THE EU ON OCTOBER 31, 2019 WITH OR WITHOUT A COMPREHENSIVE WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU, THE LATTER COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A \"HARD BREXIT\". OUR TJX EUROPE MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS EVALUATED A RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, IDENTIFIED AREAS OF CONCERN AND IMPLEMENTED STRATEGIES TO HELP MITIGATE THEM.  OUR CURRENT EUROPEAN OPERATIONS BENEFIT FROM THE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND LABOR BETWEEN THE U.K. AND EU. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE BREXIT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY MOVE MERCHANDISE BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU. BREXIT COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR TALENT IN THE REGION, BOTH BY IMPACTING CURRENT ASSOCIATES, WHO ARE EITHER EU CITIZENS WORKING IN THE U.K. OR U.K. CITIZENS WORKING IN THE EU, AND POTENTIALLY IMPACTING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION FOR OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.  24  IF THE U.K. DOES EXIT THE EU, WE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE THAT FLOWS BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU. WE HAVE REALIGNED OUR EUROPEAN DIVISION\u2019S SUPPLY CHAIN TO REDUCE THE VOLUME OF MERCHANDISE FLOWING BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU AND HAVE ESTABLISHED RESOURCES AND SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT THIS PLAN. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR ASSOCIATES ABOUT BREXIT INCLUDING PROVIDING RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES THAT MAY BE REQUIRED POST-BREXIT. IN THE EVENT OF A HARD BREXIT, OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED, PARTICULARLY IN THE SHORT TERM.  IN ADDITION TO THE OPERATIONAL IMPACTS MENTIONED ABOVE, FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND BEHAVIOR, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INTEREST RATES, CUSTOMS DUTIES, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT TO OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE SHORT TERM WITH A HARD BREXIT.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THESE DEVELOPMENTS. WE BELIEVE THE STEPS WE HAVE TAKEN, AND PLAN TO TAKE IN THE EVENT OF A HARD BREXIT, WILL HELP US MITIGATE THE RISKS THAT WE EXPECT COULD RESULT FROM BREXIT.  NET SALES  NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  TOTALED  $9.8 BILLION  , A  5%  INCREASE  OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S  SECOND  QUARTER NET SALES OF  $9.3 BILLION  . THE  INCREASE  REFLECTS A  4%  INCREASE  FROM NON-COMP SALES, A  2%  INCREASE  FROM COMP SALES, OFFSET BY A  1%  NEGATIVE  IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THIS  INCREASE  COMPARES TO SALES  GROWTH  OF  12%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , WHICH REFLECTS A  6%  INCREASE  FROM COMP SALES, A  5%  INCREASE  FROM NON-COMP SALES, AND A  1%  POSITIVE  IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  NET SALES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  TOTALED  $19.1 BILLION  , A  6%  INCREASE  OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S  SIX  -MONTH NET SALES OF  $18.0 BILLION  . THE  INCREASE  REFLECTS A  4%  INCREASE  FROM COMP SALES, A  3%  INCREASE  FROM NON-COMP SALES, OFFSET BY A  1%  NEGATIVE  IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THIS  INCREASE  COMPARES TO A SALES  GROWTH  OF  12%  FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , WHICH REFLECTS A  5%  INCREASE  FROM COMP SALES, A  5%  INCREASE  FROM NON-COMP SALES, AND A  2%  POSITIVE  IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  AS OF  AUGUST 3, 2019  , OUR STORE COUNT  INCREASE  D  5%  AND SELLING SQUARE FOOTAGE  INCREASE  D  4%  COMPARED TO THE END OF THE  SECOND  QUARTER LAST YEAR.  COMP SALES FOR BOTH THE QUARTER AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  REFLECT AN INCREASE IN THE CUSTOMER TRAFFIC ACROSS ALL MAJOR DIVISIONS. ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, APPAREL AND HOME FASHIONS' PERFORMANCE WAS COMPARABLE FOR THE QUARTER AND APPAREL OUTPERFORMED HOME FASHIONS FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019.  FOR BOTH THE QUARTER AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  , COMP SALES GROWTH IN THE U.S. WAS STRONGEST IN THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST REGIONS. COMP SALES GROWTH FOR TJX INTERNATIONAL WAS ABOVE THE CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE, WHEREAS TJX CANADA WAS BELOW THE CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE.  WE DEFINE COMPARABLE STORE SALES, OR COMP SALES, TO BE SALES OF STORES THAT HAVE BEEN IN OPERATION FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF TWO CONSECUTIVE FISCAL YEARS, OR IN OTHER WORDS, STORES THAT ARE STARTING THEIR THIRD FISCAL YEAR OF OPERATION. WE CALCULATE COMP SALES ON A 52-WEEK BASIS BY COMPARING THE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR WEEKLY PERIODS THAT ARE MOST CLOSELY ALIGNED. RELOCATED STORES AND STORES THAT HAVE CHANGED IN SIZE ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE ORIGINAL STORE, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE IMPACT OF THESE STORES ON THE CONSOLIDATED COMP PERCENTAGE IS IMMATERIAL.  WE DEFINE CUSTOMER TRAFFIC TO BE THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN STORES INCLUDED IN THE COMP SALES CALCULATION AND AVERAGE TICKET TO BE THE AVERAGE RETAIL PRICE OF THE UNITS SOLD. WE DEFINE AVERAGE TRANSACTION OR AVERAGE BASKET TO BE THE AVERAGE DOLLAR VALUE OF TRANSACTIONS INCLUDED IN THE COMP SALES CALCULATION.  SALES EXCLUDED FROM COMP SALES (\u201cNON-COMP SALES\u201d) CONSIST OF SALES FROM.  \u2013  NEW STORES - STORES THAT HAVE NOT YET MET THE COMP SALES CRITERIA, WHICH REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF NON-COMP SALES  \u2013  STORES THAT ARE CLOSED PERMANENTLY OR FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME  \u2013  SALES FROM OUR E-COMMERCE SITES, MEANING SIERRA.COM, TJMAXX.COM AND TKMAXX.COM  WE DETERMINE WHICH STORES ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMP SALES CALCULATION AT THE BEGINNING OF A FISCAL YEAR AND THE CLASSIFICATION REMAINS CONSTANT THROUGHOUT THAT YEAR UNLESS A STORE IS CLOSED PERMANENTLY OR FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD DURING THAT FISCAL YEAR. STARTING IN FISCAL 2020, SIERRA STORES THAT OTHERWISE FIT THE COMP STORE DEFINITION ARE INCLUDED IN COMP STORES IN OUR MARMAXX SEGMENT.  COMP SALES OF OUR FOREIGN SEGMENTS ARE CALCULATED BY TRANSLATING THE CURRENT YEAR\u2019S COMP SALES OF OUR FOREIGN SEGMENTS AT THE SAME EXCHANGE RATES USED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS REMOVES THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A MORE ACCURATE MEASURE OF SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  25  COMP SALES MAY BE REFERRED TO AS \u201cSAME STORE\u201d SALES BY OTHER RETAIL COMPANIES. THE METHOD FOR CALCULATING COMP SALES VARIES ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY, THEREFORE OUR MEASURE OF COMP SALES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THAT OF OTHER RETAIL COMPANIES.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE FOLLOWING PERIODS.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  AUGUST 4, 2018  AUGUST 3, 2019  AUGUST 4, 2018  NET SALES  100.0%  100.0%  100.0%  100.0%  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  71.8  71.1  71.7  71.1  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  17.7  18.2  18.0  18.0  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  INCOME BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  *  10.4%  10.6%  10.3%  10.8%  *  FIGURES MAY NOT FOOT DUE TO ROUNDING.  IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES  OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR OR A DIVISION\u2019S LOCAL CURRENCY IN RELATION TO OTHER CURRENCIES. TWO WAYS IN WHICH FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AFFECT OUR REPORTED RESULTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u2013  TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN OPERATING RESULTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS.  IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE TRANSLATE THE OPERATIONS OF TJX CANADA AND TJX INTERNATIONAL FROM LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING CURRENCY RATES IN EFFECT AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN COMPARABLE PRIOR PERIODS CAN RESULT IN MEANINGFUL VARIATIONS IN NET SALES, NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH AS WELL AS THE NET SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS OF THESE SEGMENTS. CURRENCY TRANSLATION GENERALLY DOES NOT AFFECT OPERATING MARGINS, OR AFFECTS THEM ONLY SLIGHTLY, AS SALES AND EXPENSES OF THE FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE TRANSLATED AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME RATES WITHIN A GIVEN PERIOD.  \u2013  INVENTORY-RELATED DERIVATIVES.  WE ROUTINELY ENTER INTO INVENTORY-RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON EARNINGS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON MERCHANDISE PURCHASES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE LOCAL CURRENCIES OF OUR DIVISIONS, PRINCIPALLY TJX CANADA AND TJX INTERNATIONAL. AS WE HAVE NOT ELECTED \u201cHEDGE ACCOUNTING\u201d FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS, AS DEFINED BY U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d), WE RECORD A MARK-TO-MARKET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD. IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS, THE INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT OF THE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT IS EFFECTIVELY OFFSET WHEN THE INVENTORY BEING HEDGED IS RECEIVED AND PAID FOR. WHILE THESE EFFECTS OCCUR EVERY REPORTING PERIOD, THEY ARE OF MUCH GREATER MAGNITUDE WHEN THERE ARE SUDDEN AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES DURING A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT ON THESE DERIVATIVES DOES NOT AFFECT NET SALES, BUT IT DOES AFFECT THE COST OF SALES, OPERATING MARGINS AND EARNINGS WE REPORT.  WE REFER TO THE IMPACT OF THE ABOVE TWO ITEMS THROUGHOUT OUR DISCUSSION AS \u201cFOREIGN CURRENCY.\u201d THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CAN HAVE ON VARIOUS TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN AN OPERATING DIVISION\u2019S LOCAL CURRENCY. WHEN DISCUSSING THE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF THE EFFECT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON SUCH TRANSACTIONS WE REFER TO IT AS \u201cTRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE.\u201d  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS  71.8%  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  , AN  INCREASE  OF  0.7  PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM  71.1%  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  AND WAS  71.7%  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  , AN  INCREASE  OF  0.6  PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM  71.1%  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 4, 2018  . THE  INCREASE  FOR BOTH PERIODS WAS DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN AND HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS.  THE DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS DRIVEN BY A LOWER MARKON, IN PART DUE TO TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AND HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SG&A EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, WERE  17.7%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  , A  DECREASE  OF  0.5  PERCENTAGE POINTS OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S  SECOND  QUARTER RATIO OF  18.2%  . SG&A EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, WERE  18.0%  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  AND FLAT TO LAST YEAR'S RATIO FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 4, 2018  . THE EXPENSE RATIO FOR BOTH PERIODS REFLECTS THE FAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON OF THE CORPORATE IT RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO TJX'S  CHARITABLE FOUNDATIONS MADE IN FISCAL  2019  AND A BENEFIT FROM INSURANCE CLAIM SETTLEMENTS RECEIVED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF  26  FISCAL  2020  .

THE  INCREASE  IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REDUCTION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFIT FROM SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND THE EXPANDED LIMITATIONS ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION, OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN THE IMPACT OF THE FOREIGN OPERATIONS.  NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE  NET INCOME FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  $759 MILLION  , OR  $0.62  PER DILUTED SHARE COMPARED TO  $740 MILLION  , OR  $0.58  PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . FOREIGN CURRENCY HAD A NEUTRAL IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR BOTH THE  SECOND  QUARTERS OF FISCAL  2020  AND FISCAL  2019.

THE  DECREASE  IN SEGMENT MARGIN FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIOD WAS DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN (PRIMARILY HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS AND LOWER MARKON) AND AN INCREASE IN SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS. THESE REDUCTIONS IN SEGMENT MARGIN WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INSURANCE RECOVERIES DUE TO THE SETTLEMENT OF BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE HURRICANE DAMAGE IN PUERTO RICO, AND BY LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ACCRUALS IN FISCAL  2020.  OUR U.S. E-COMMERCE BUSINESSES, WHICH REPRESENT LESS THAN 3% OF MARMAXX\u2019S NET SALES FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  AND FISCAL  2019  , DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON YEAR-OVER-YEAR SEGMENT MARGIN COMPARISONS FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020.  28  HOMEGOODS  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED  U.S. DOLLARS IN MILLIONS  AUGUST 3,  2019  AUGUST 4,  2018  AUGUST 3,  2019  AUGUST 4,  2018  NET SALES  $1,425  $1,327  $2,822  $2,597  SEGMENT PROFIT  $129  $142  $266  $289  SEGMENT PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  9.0%  10.7%  9.4%  11.1%  INCREASE IN COMP SALES  0%  3%  0%  2%  STORES IN OPERATION AT END OF PERIOD.

THE  SIX  -MONTH  INCREASE  IN NET SALES REPRESENTS AN  INCREASE  OF  9%  FROM NON-COMP SALES AND FLAT COMP SALES. THE FLAT COMP SALES FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  WAS THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE AVERAGE BASKET.

THE DECLINE IN SEGMENT MARGIN FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND  SIX  -MONTH-PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS, THE INVESTMENT IN STORE GROWTH, EXPENSE DELEVERAGE ON THE FLAT COMP SALES AND A DECLINE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN. MERCHANDISE MARGIN DECREASED FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS LAST YEAR.

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN FUNDED THROUGH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, SUPPLEMENTED, AS NEEDED, BY SHORT-TERM BANK BORROWINGS AND THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. AS OF  AUGUST 3, 2019  , THERE WERE NO SHORT-TERM BANK BORROWINGS OR COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING.  31  WE BELIEVE OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS AND OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, DESCRIBED IN  NOTE I  \u2013  LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT LINES  OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ARE MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR OPERATING NEEDS OVER THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR.

APPROXIMATELY  $0.7 BILLION  OF OUR CASH WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WITH  $0.3 BILLION  HELD IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE PROVISIONALLY INTEND TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST ANY UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS. TJX PROVIDED FOR ALL APPLICABLE STATE AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES ON ALL UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN CANADA, PUERTO RICO, ITALY, INDIA, HONG KONG AND VIETNAM THROUGH  AUGUST 3, 2019  . IF WE REPATRIATE CASH FROM SUCH SUBSIDIARIES, WE SHOULD NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL TAX EXPENSE AND OUR CASH WOULD BE REDUCED BY THE AMOUNT OF WITHHOLDING TAXES PAID.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $0.9 BILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019  AND  $1.6 BILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 4, 2018  .

OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOR THE  FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  DECREASE  D  BY  $0.7 BILLION  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  . THE  DECLINE  IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, NET OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $0.4 BILLION.  IN ADDITION, LAST YEAR'S FIRST QUARTER CASH FLOWS WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY A DECREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSES PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PREFUNDING OF CERTAIN SERVICE CONTRACTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 2018.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES RESULTED IN NET CASH OUTFLOWS OF  $0.6 BILLION  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 3, 2019  AND  $0.1 BILLION  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 4, 2018  . THE CASH OUTFLOWS FOR BOTH PERIODS WERE DRIVEN BY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.
