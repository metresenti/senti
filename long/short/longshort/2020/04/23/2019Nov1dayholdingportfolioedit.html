BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE WAS $218.82 AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, 2.2% HIGHER COMPARED WITH JUNE 2019 AND 10.9% HIGHER COMPARED WITH SEPTEMBER 2018.  NET REVENUES WERE $8.32 BILLION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, 6% LOWER THAN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING, DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN EQUITY SECURITIES, AND INVESTMENT BANKING, PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES, ACROSS BOTH FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES (FICC) CLIENT EXECUTION AND EQUITIES.  PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $291 MILLION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, 67% HIGHER THAN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER IMPAIRMENTS.  OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $5.62 BILLION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER EXPENSES FOR CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS AND HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, LARGELY OFFSET BY LOWER COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES.  WE RETURNED $1.14 BILLION OF CAPITAL TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, INCLUDING $673 MILLION OF COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES AND $466 MILLION OF COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WAS $16.32 FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, A DECREASE OF 15%, COMPARED WITH $19.21 FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018. ANNUALIZED ROE WAS 10.4% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, COMPARED WITH 13.7% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018. BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019 WAS 5.5% HIGHER COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 2018.  NET REVENUES WERE $26.59 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, 7% LOWER THAN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018, REFLECTING LOWER NET REVENUES ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS. NET REVENUES WERE LOWER IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES, ACROSS BOTH EQUITIES AND FICC CLIENT EXECUTION, AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER INCENTIVE FEES. IN ADDITION, NET REVENUES WERE LOWER IN INVESTMENT BANKING, DUE TO LOWER NET REVENUES IN UNDERWRITING, AND INVESTING & LENDING, REFLECTING LOWER NET REVENUES IN EQUITY SECURITIES.  PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $729 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, 61% HIGHER THAN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER IMPAIRMENTS AND HIGHER PROVISIONS RELATED TO CONSUMER LOANS.  OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $17.60 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, 4% LOWER THAN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018, DUE TO LOWER COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES AND LOWER NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EXPENSES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS, TECHNOLOGY AND OUR CREDIT CARD ACTIVITIES.  PRE-TAX  EARNINGS WERE $8.26 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 AND INCLUDED OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR DIGITAL PLATFORM,  MARCUS: BY GOLDMAN SACHS  (MARCUS), OUR CREDIT CARD ACTIVITIES, AND THE PLANNED LAUNCH OF OUR TRANSACTION BANKING ACTIVITIES, WHICH COLLECTIVELY HAD A  PRE-TAX  LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, GLOBAL REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) GROWTH APPEARED TO DECREASE COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, REFLECTING DECREASED GROWTH IN BOTH EMERGING MARKETS AND ADVANCED ECONOMIES, INCLUDING IN THE U.S. CONTINUED CONCERNS ABOUT FUTURE GLOBAL GROWTH AND A MIXED MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT LED TO ACCOMMODATIVE MONETARY POLICIES BY GLOBAL CENTRAL BANKS, INCLUDING TWO CUTS TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE BY THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE DURING THE QUARTER TO A TARGET RANGE OF 1.75% TO 2.00%. THE MARKET SENTIMENT IN THE THIRD QUARTER WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY CONTINUED GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY, INCLUDING ONGOING TRADE CONCERNS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA, THE APPROACHING DEADLINE RELATED TO THE U.K.\u2019S DECISION TO LEAVE THE E.U. (BREXIT), TURMOIL IN ARGENTINA AND A TEMPORARY SPIKE IN OIL PRICES. SEE \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2014 SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS DURING THE QUARTER.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  FAIR VALUE  FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED (I.E., INVENTORY), AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT FAIR VALUE (I.E.,  MARKED-TO-MARKET),  WITH RELATED GAINS OR LOSSES GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. THE USE OF FAIR VALUE TO MEASURE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND IS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY.  THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. WE MEASURE CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AS A PORTFOLIO (I.E., BASED ON ITS NET EXPOSURE TO MARKET AND/OR CREDIT RISKS). IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, THE HIERARCHY UNDER U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (U.S. GAAP) GIVES (I) THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL, UNRESTRICTED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES (LEVEL 1 INPUTS), (II) THE NEXT PRIORITY TO INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY (LEVEL 2 INPUTS), AND (III) THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO INPUTS THAT CANNOT BE OBSERVED IN MARKET ACTIVITY (LEVEL 3 INPUTS). IN EVALUATING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A VALUATION INPUT, WE CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, A PORTFOLIO\u2019S NET RISK EXPOSURE TO THAT INPUT. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THEIR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.  89  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  THE FAIR VALUES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE PRICES AND INPUTS AND ARE CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 1 AND 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. CERTAIN LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES MAY REQUIRE APPROPRIATE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD REQUIRE TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE FOR FACTORS, SUCH AS COUNTERPARTY AND OUR CREDIT QUALITY, FUNDING RISK, TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, LIQUIDITY AND BID/OFFER SPREADS.  INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE THOSE WHICH REQUIRE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS THAT ARE NOT OBSERVABLE. LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS REPRESENTED 2.3% AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, AND 2.4% AS OF BOTH JUNE 2019 AND DECEMBER 2018, OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS. SEE NOTES 5 THROUGH 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND RELATED FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. ABSENT EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE INITIALLY VALUED AT TRANSACTION PRICE, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEST INITIAL ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. SUBSEQUENT TO THE TRANSACTION DATE, WE USE OTHER METHODOLOGIES TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, WHICH VARY BASED ON THE TYPE OF INSTRUMENT. ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REQUIRES JUDGMENTS TO BE MADE. THESE JUDGMENTS INCLUDE.  \u2022  DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY AND/OR MODEL FOR EACH TYPE OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT;  \u2022  DETERMINING MODEL INPUTS BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF ALL RELEVANT EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA, INCLUDING PRICES EVIDENCED BY MARKET TRANSACTIONS, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS; AND  \u2022  DETERMINING APPROPRIATE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO ILLIQUIDITY OR COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY.  REGARDLESS OF THE METHODOLOGY, VALUATION INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE ONLY CHANGED WHEN CORROBORATED BY SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE.  CONTROLS OVER VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  MARKET MAKERS AND INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS IN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRICING OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. OUR CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE IS INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ENSURING THAT ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE APPROPRIATELY VALUED AT MARKET-CLEARING LEVELS. IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN SITUATIONS WHERE ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REQUIRES JUDGMENT (E.G., CALIBRATION TO MARKET COMPARABLES OR TRADE COMPARISON, AS DESCRIBED BELOW), THE FINAL VALUATION DECISION IS MADE BY SENIOR MANAGERS IN INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS. THIS INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE PROPERLY VALUED.  PRICE VERIFICATION.  ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 1, 2 AND 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE SUBJECT TO OUR INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION PROCESS. THE OBJECTIVE OF PRICE VERIFICATION IS TO HAVE AN INFORMED AND INDEPENDENT OPINION WITH REGARD TO THE VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS UNDER REVIEW. INSTRUMENTS THAT HAVE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS WHICH CANNOT BE CORROBORATED BY EXTERNAL MARKET DATA ARE CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. PRICE VERIFICATION STRATEGIES UTILIZED BY OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS INCLUDE.  \u2022  TRADE COMPARISON.  ANALYSIS OF TRADE DATA (BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL, WHERE AVAILABLE) IS USED TO DETERMINE THE MOST RELEVANT PRICING INPUTS AND VALUATIONS.  \u2022  EXTERNAL PRICE COMPARISON.  VALUATIONS AND PRICES ARE COMPARED TO PRICING DATA OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES (E.G., BROKERS OR DEALERS, MARKIT, BLOOMBERG, IDC, TRACE). DATA OBTAINED FROM VARIOUS SOURCES IS COMPARED TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY AND VALIDITY. WHEN BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS OR THIRD-PARTY PRICING VENDORS ARE USED FOR VALUATION OR PRICE VERIFICATION, GREATER PRIORITY IS GENERALLY GIVEN TO EXECUTABLE QUOTATIONS.  \u2022  CALIBRATION TO MARKET COMPARABLES.  MARKET-BASED TRANSACTIONS ARE USED TO CORROBORATE THE VALUATION OF POSITIONS WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS, RISKS AND COMPONENTS.  \u2022  RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES.  MARKET-BASED TRANSACTIONS ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE SIMILARITY, MEASURED IN TERMS OF RISK, LIQUIDITY AND RETURN, OF ONE INSTRUMENT RELATIVE TO ANOTHER OR, FOR A GIVEN INSTRUMENT, OF ONE MATURITY RELATIVE TO ANOTHER.  \u2022  COLLATERAL ANALYSES.  MARGIN CALLS ON DERIVATIVES ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE IMPLIED VALUES, WHICH ARE USED TO CORROBORATE OUR VALUATIONS.  \u2022  EXECUTION OF TRADES.  WHERE APPROPRIATE, TRADING DESKS ARE INSTRUCTED TO EXECUTE TRADES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF MARKET-CLEARING LEVELS.  \u2022  BACKTESTING.  VALUATIONS ARE CORROBORATED BY COMPARISON TO VALUES REALIZED UPON SALES.  SEE NOTES 5 THROUGH 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.  REVIEW OF NET REVENUES.  INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS ENSURE ADHERENCE TO OUR PRICING POLICY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DAILY PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THE EXPLANATION AND ATTRIBUTION OF NET REVENUES BASED ON THE UNDERLYING FACTORS. THROUGH THIS PROCESS, WE INDEPENDENTLY VALIDATE NET REVENUES, IDENTIFY AND RESOLVE POTENTIAL FAIR VALUE OR TRADE BOOKING ISSUES ON A TIMELY BASIS AND SEEK TO ENSURE THAT RISKS ARE BEING PROPERLY CATEGORIZED AND QUANTIFIED.  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  90  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  REVIEW OF VALUATION MODELS.  OUR INDEPENDENT MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP (MODEL RISK), CONSISTING OF QUANTITATIVE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE SEPARATE FROM MODEL DEVELOPERS, PERFORMS AN INDEPENDENT MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION PROCESS OF OUR VALUATION MODELS. NEW OR CHANGED MODELS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION. MODELS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF ANY CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT OR MARKET AND ANY MARKET DEVELOPMENTS IN PRICING THEORIES. SEE \u201cRISK MANAGEMENT \u2014  MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE REVIEW AND VALIDATION OF OUR VALUATION MODELS.  GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS  GOODWILL.  GOODWILL IS THE COST OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AT THE ACQUISITION DATE.  GOODWILL IS ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT INDICATE AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. WHEN ASSESSING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, FIRST, QUALITATIVE FACTORS ARE ASSESSED TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS ESTIMATED CARRYING VALUE. IF THE RESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ARE NOT CONCLUSIVE, A QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST IS PERFORMED BY COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS ESTIMATED CARRYING VALUE.  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WE ASSESSED GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS BY PERFORMING A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT AND DETERMINED THAT GOODWILL FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT WAS NOT IMPAIRED. THERE WERE NO EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019 THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS DID NOT EXCEED ITS RESPECTIVE ESTIMATED CARRYING VALUE AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019. SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT GOODWILL.  ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS. CRITICAL INPUTS TO THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES INCLUDE PROJECTED EARNINGS AND ATTRIBUTED EQUITY. THERE IS INHERENT UNCERTAINTY IN THE PROJECTED EARNINGS. THE ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT REFLECTS AN ALLOCATION OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AND REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE REPORTING UNIT UNDER CURRENTLY APPLICABLE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. SEE \u201cEQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY CAPITAL\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  IF WE EXPERIENCE A PROLONGED OR SEVERE PERIOD OF WEAKNESS IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, FINANCIAL MARKETS, OUR PERFORMANCE OR OUR COMMON STOCK PRICE, OR ADDITIONAL INCREASES IN CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, OUR GOODWILL COULD BE IMPAIRED IN THE FUTURE.  IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  WE AMORTIZE OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES GENERALLY USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGEST THAT AN ASSET\u2019S OR ASSET GROUP\u2019S CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE.  A PROLONGED OR SEVERE PERIOD OF MARKET WEAKNESS, OR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN REGULATION, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN EVENTS COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING WEAKER BUSINESS PERFORMANCE RESULTING IN A DECREASE IN OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND DECREASES IN REVENUES FROM CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND RELATIONSHIPS. MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO EVALUATE WHETHER INDICATIONS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT HAVE OCCURRED, AND TO TEST INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT, IF REQUIRED.  AN IMPAIRMENT, GENERALLY CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, IS RECOGNIZED IF THE TOTAL OF THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS RELATING TO THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS LESS THAN THE CORRESPONDING CARRYING VALUE. SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS  SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS.  USE OF ESTIMATES  U.S. GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE ESTIMATES WE MAKE IN CONNECTION WITH FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION ACCRUALS, THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS ALSO IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS RECEIVABLE AND LENDING COMMITMENTS HELD FOR INVESTMENT, PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS), AND PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM TAX AUDITS.  91  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS REPRESENTS DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION, WHICH IS FINALIZED AT  YEAR-END.  WE BELIEVE THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY TO ALLOCATE ESTIMATED  YEAR-END  DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION AMONG INTERIM PERIODS IS IN PROPORTION TO THE NET REVENUES EARNED IN SUCH PERIODS. IN ADDITION TO THE LEVEL OF NET REVENUES, OUR OVERALL COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR IS ALSO INFLUENCED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, PREVAILING LABOR MARKETS, BUSINESS MIX, THE STRUCTURE OF OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS AND THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT.  WE ESTIMATE AND RECORD AN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO OUR LOANS RECEIVABLE AND LENDING COMMITMENTS HELD FOR INVESTMENT. MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATE OF CREDIT LOSSES ENTAILS JUDGMENT ABOUT COLLECTABILITY AT THE REPORTING DATES, AND THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN THOSE JUDGMENTS. SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.  WE ALSO ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSSES ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN ADDITION, WE ESTIMATE THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE AGGREGATE LOSS IN EXCESS OF THE RELATED RESERVES FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS WHERE WE BELIEVE THE RISK OF LOSS IS MORE THAN SLIGHT. SEE NOTES 18 AND 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT CERTAIN JUDICIAL, LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES AND OUR FINAL LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT. OUR TOTAL ESTIMATED LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS IS DETERMINED ON A  CASE-BY-CASE  BASIS AND REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES AFTER CONSIDERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE PROGRESS OF EACH CASE, PROCEEDING OR INVESTIGATION, OUR EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS IN SIMILAR CASES, PROCEEDINGS OR INVESTIGATIONS, AND THE OPINIONS AND VIEWS OF LEGAL COUNSEL.  IN ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, WE RECOGNIZE TAX POSITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ONLY WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE RELEVANT TAXING AUTHORITY BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. SEE NOTE 24 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT INCOME TAXES.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE COMPOSITION OF OUR NET REVENUES HAS VARIED OVER TIME AS FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE SCOPE OF OUR OPERATIONS HAVE CHANGED.

ANNUALIZED RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY (ROTE) IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ANNUALIZED NET EARNINGS APPLICABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY AVERAGE MONTHLY TANGIBLE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. WE BELIEVE THAT TANGIBLE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY IS MEANINGFUL BECAUSE IT IS A MEASURE THAT WE AND INVESTORS USE TO ASSESS CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND THAT ROTE IS MEANINGFUL BECAUSE IT MEASURES THE PERFORMANCE OF BUSINESSES CONSISTENTLY, WHETHER THEY WERE ACQUIRED OR DEVELOPED INTERNALLY.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED TRADE TENSIONS AND CONCERNS OVER A SLOWDOWN IN FUTURE GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. VOLATILITY IN EQUITY MARKETS INCREASED IN AUGUST AND THE AVERAGE DAILY VIX FOR THE QUARTER WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. IN ADDITION, MONETARY POLICIES SET BY GLOBAL CENTRAL BANKS REMAINED ACCOMMODATIVE. INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITIES REFLECTED DECREASES IN INDUSTRY-WIDE COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS TRANSACTIONS AND INDUSTRY-WIDE EQUITY AND DEBT UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS. OUR ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED FROM ACQUISITIONS, ORGANIC NET INFLOWS AND APPRECIATION IN OUR CLIENT ASSETS, REFLECTING GENERALLY HIGHER FIXED INCOME PRICES. GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS GENERALLY ENDED THE QUARTER ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED AFTER MARKETS REBOUNDED IN SEPTEMBER FOLLOWING DECLINES IN AUGUST.  IF MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS CONTINUE, OR IF MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITY LEVELS DECLINE, OR VOLATILITY DECLINES, OR IF INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION LEVELS CONTINUE TO DECLINE, OR IF ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION DECLINE, OR IF GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS DECLINE, NET REVENUES WOULD LIKELY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COMPARED WITH A STRONG THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, REFLECTING A DECREASE IN COMPLETED MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS TRANSACTIONS. REVENUES IN UNDERWRITING WERE LOWER, DUE TO LOWER REVENUES IN EQUITY UNDERWRITING, REFLECTING A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS, AND IN DEBT UNDERWRITING, REFLECTING A DECREASE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE LEVERAGED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS.

OUR EFFICIENCY RATIO (TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES DIVIDED BY TOTAL NET REVENUES) FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 WAS 67.5%, COMPARED WITH 63.1% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.  OPERATING EXPENSES, COMPARED WITH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, REFLECTED HIGHER EXPENSES FOR CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS (INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, OCCUPANCY AND OTHER EXPENSES) AND HIGHER BROKERAGE, CLEARING, EXCHANGE AND DISTRIBUTION FEES, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN ACTIVITY LEVELS.

AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  THE DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES COMPARED WITH THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018 WAS DUE TO LOWER COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, REFLECTING A DECLINE IN OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND LOWER NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EXPENSES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS AND TECHNOLOGY (INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, OCCUPANCY, COMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY, AND OTHER EXPENSES), AS WELL AS HIGHER EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR CREDIT CARD ACTIVITIES (INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY IN PROFESSIONAL FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES).  NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 WERE $150 MILLION COMPARED WITH $328 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018.  HEADCOUNT INCREASED 3% COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 2018.  PROVISION FOR TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 WAS 20.7%, UP FROM THE FULL YEAR TAX RATE OF 16.2% FOR 2018, WHICH INCLUDED A $487 MILLION INCOME TAX BENEFIT IN 2018 RELATED TO THE FINALIZATION OF THE IMPACT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (TAX LEGISLATION). THE INCREASE COMPARED WITH 20.1% FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE IMPACT OF PERMANENT TAX BENEFITS IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED WITH THE FIRST HALF OF 2019.  TAX LEGISLATION REDUCED THE U.S. CORPORATE TAX RATE TO 21%, ELIMINATED TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR CERTAIN EXPENSES AND ENACTED TWO NEW TAXES, BASE EROSION AND ANTI-ABUSE TAX (BEAT) AND GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW TAXED INCOME (GILTI). BEAT IS AN ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX THAT APPLIES TO BANKS THAT PAY MORE THAN 2% OF TOTAL DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES TO CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. GILTI IS EFFECTIVELY A 10.5% TAX, BEFORE ALLOWABLE CREDITS FOR FOREIGN TAXES PAID, ON THE ANNUAL TAXABLE INCOME OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. INCOME TAX EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH GILTI IS RECOGNIZED AS INCURRED. IN JUNE 2019, THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY (U.S. TREASURY) RELEASED FINAL, TEMPORARY AND PROPOSED REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GILTI. THE FINAL AND TEMPORARY REGULATIONS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 AND THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS WOULD BE APPLICABLE ONLY AFTER FINAL REGULATIONS ARE PUBLISHED. IN 2018, THE IRS AND U.S. TREASURY ISSUED PROPOSED REGULATIONS RELATING TO BEAT AND GILTI. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 INCLUDES ESTIMATES FOR BEAT AND GILTI THAT ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT INTERPRETATION OF THESE PROPOSED REGULATIONS. WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE FINALIZATION OF THESE PROPOSED REGULATIONS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THESE ESTIMATES. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE ESTIMATES ARE MATERIALLY IMPACTED IF THE FINAL REGULATIONS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM OUR CURRENT INTERPRETATION OF THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS.  BASED ON OUR CURRENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE RULES AND LEGISLATIVE GUIDANCE TO DATE, WE EXPECT OUR 2019 TAX RATE TO BE APPROXIMATELY 22%.

IN THIS ROLE, WE SEEK TO EARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRICE AT WHICH A MARKET PARTICIPANT IS WILLING TO SELL AN INSTRUMENT TO US AND THE PRICE AT WHICH ANOTHER MARKET PARTICIPANT IS WILLING TO BUY IT FROM US, AND VICE VERSA (I.E., BID/OFFER SPREAD). IN ADDITION, WE MAINTAIN INVENTORY, TYPICALLY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, IN RESPONSE TO, OR IN ANTICIPATION OF, CLIENT DEMAND. WE ALSO HOLD INVENTORY TO ACTIVELY MANAGE OUR RISK EXPOSURES THAT ARISE FROM THESE MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. OUR MARKET-MAKING INVENTORY IS RECORDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED (LONG POSITIONS) OR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED (SHORT POSITIONS) IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.  OUR RESULTS ARE INFLUENCED BY A COMBINATION OF INTERCONNECTED DRIVERS, INCLUDING (I) CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS AND TRANSACTIONAL BID/OFFER SPREADS (COLLECTIVELY, CLIENT ACTIVITY), AND (II) CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY AND INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE HOLDING, HEDGING AND FUNDING OF OUR INVENTORY (COLLECTIVELY, MARKET-MAKING INVENTORY CHANGES). DUE TO THE INTEGRATED NATURE OF OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, DISAGGREGATION OF NET REVENUES INTO CLIENT ACTIVITY AND MARKET-MAKING INVENTORY CHANGES IS JUDGMENTAL AND HAS INHERENT COMPLEXITIES AND LIMITATIONS.  THE AMOUNT AND COMPOSITION OF OUR NET REVENUES VARY OVER TIME AS THESE DRIVERS ARE IMPACTED BY MULTIPLE INTERRELATED FACTORS AFFECTING ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, EQUITY PRICES AND COMMODITY PRICES, INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, AND OTHER MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS AND UNCERTAINTIES.  IN GENERAL, ASSUMING ALL OTHER MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS REMAIN CONSTANT, INCREASES IN CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS OR BID/OFFER SPREADS TEND TO RESULT IN INCREASES IN NET REVENUES, AND DECREASES TEND TO HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT. HOWEVER, CHANGES IN MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS AND BID/OFFER SPREADS, AS WELL AS THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY. FOR EXAMPLE, A DECREASE IN LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET COULD HAVE THE IMPACT OF (I) INCREASING OUR BID/OFFER SPREAD, (II) DECREASING INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AND THEREBY DECREASING CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS, AND (III) WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS ON OUR INVENTORY POSITIONS.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS WHICH WEIGHED ON MARKET SENTIMENT, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED TRADE TENSIONS AND CONCERNS OVER A SLOWDOWN IN FUTURE GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. IN ADDITION, MONETARY POLICIES SET BY GLOBAL CENTRAL BANKS REMAINED ACCOMMODATIVE, INCLUDING TWO RATE CUTS BY THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, MARKET CONDITIONS WERE MIXED AS VOLATILITY INCREASED (THE AVERAGE DAILY VIX WAS 43% HIGHER IN AUGUST COMPARED WITH JULY, WHILE AVERAGE DAILY VIX WAS 16 FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED WITH 15 FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019), THE YIELD CURVE FOR THE U.S. TREASURY  2-YEAR  NOTE VERSUS THE  10-YEAR  NOTE TEMPORARILY INVERTED FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2007 AND GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS REBOUNDED IN SEPTEMBER FOLLOWING DECLINES IN AUGUST (MSCI WORLD INDEX DECREASED 1% COMPARED WITH JUNE 2019). THESE CONDITIONS CONTRIBUTED TO SOLID CLIENT ACTIVITY IN FICC CLIENT EXECUTION, WHILE CLIENT ACTIVITY IN EQUITIES WAS LOWER COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. IF ACTIVITY LEVELS DECLINE, OR VOLATILITY DECLINES, OR IF MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS CONTINUE, NET REVENUES IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES WOULD LIKELY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PLANNING PROCESS ARE.  \u2022  TO DEVELOP OUR BALANCE SHEET PROJECTIONS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE GENERAL STATE OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND EXPECTED BUSINESS ACTIVITY LEVELS, AS WELL AS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS;  \u2022  TO ALLOW TREASURY AND OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS TO OBJECTIVELY EVALUATE BALANCE SHEET LIMIT REQUESTS FROM OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR OVERALL BALANCE SHEET CONSTRAINTS, INCLUDING OUR LIABILITY PROFILE AND EQUITY CAPITAL LEVELS, AND KEY METRICS; AND  \u2022  TO INFORM THE TARGET AMOUNT, TENOR AND TYPE OF FUNDING TO RAISE, BASED ON OUR PROJECTED ASSETS AND CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES.  TREASURY AND OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS, ALONG WITH OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, REVIEW CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION AND EXPECTATIONS FOR THE YEAR TO PREPARE OUR BALANCE SHEET PLAN. THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION REVIEWED INCLUDES ASSET AND LIABILITY SIZE AND COMPOSITION, LIMIT UTILIZATION, RISK AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES, AND CAPITAL USAGE.  OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET PLAN, INCLUDING OUR BALANCE SHEETS BY BUSINESS, FUNDING PROJECTIONS AND PROJECTED KEY METRICS, IS REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE FIRMWIDE ASSET LIABILITY COMMITTEE AND THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE. SEE \u201cRISK MANAGEMENT \u2014 OVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR AN OVERVIEW OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE.  BALANCE SHEET LIMITS.  THE FIRMWIDE ASSET LIABILITY COMMITTEE AND THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO REVIEW AND APPROVE BALANCE SHEET LIMITS. THESE LIMITS ARE SET AT LEVELS WHICH ARE CLOSE TO ACTUAL OPERATING LEVELS, RATHER THAN AT LEVELS WHICH REFLECT OUR MAXIMUM RISK APPETITE, IN ORDER TO ENSURE PROMPT ESCALATION AND DISCUSSION AMONG OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, TREASURY AND OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS ON A ROUTINE BASIS. ADDITIONALLY, THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE SETS AGED INVENTORY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS A DISINCENTIVE TO HOLD INVENTORY OVER LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. REQUESTS FOR CHANGES IN LIMITS ARE EVALUATED AFTER GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THEIR IMPACT ON OUR KEY METRICS. COMPLIANCE WITH LIMITS IS MONITORED BY OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND TREASURY, AS WELL AS OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS.  MONITORING OF KEY METRICS.  WE MONITOR KEY BALANCE SHEET METRICS BOTH BY BUSINESS AND ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, INCLUDING ASSET AND LIABILITY SIZE AND COMPOSITION, LIMIT UTILIZATION AND RISK MEASURES. WE ALLOCATE ASSETS TO BUSINESSES AND REVIEW AND ANALYZE MOVEMENTS RESULTING FROM NEW BUSINESS ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS MARKET FLUCTUATIONS.  SCENARIO ANALYSES.  WE CONDUCT VARIOUS SCENARIO ANALYSES INCLUDING AS PART OF THE COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (CCAR) AND U.S. DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (DODD-FRANK ACT) STRESS TESTS (DFAST), AS WELL AS OUR RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY PLANNING. SEE \u201cEQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY CAPITAL \u2014 EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THESE SCENARIO ANALYSES. THESE SCENARIOS COVER SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM TIME HORIZONS USING VARIOUS MACROECONOMIC AND FIRM-SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS, BASED ON A RANGE OF ECONOMIC SCENARIOS. WE USE THESE ANALYSES TO ASSIST US IN DEVELOPING OUR LONGER-TERM BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT STRATEGY, INCLUDING THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF ASSETS, FUNDING AND EQUITY CAPITAL. ADDITIONALLY, THESE ANALYSES HELP US DEVELOP APPROACHES FOR MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE FUNDING, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL ACROSS A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS, INCLUDING A SEVERELY STRESSED ENVIRONMENT.

THE INCREASE IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER CLIENT ACTIVITY IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS. THE INCREASE IN OTHER ASSETS PRIMARILY REFLECTED PURCHASES OF  HELD-TO-MATURITY  SECURITIES AND RECOGNITION OF OPERATING LEASE  RIGHT-OF-USE  ASSETS UPON ADOPTION OF ASU NO.  2016-02.  THE DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF OUR ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN OUR GCLA.

THE INCREASE IN COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF OUR AND OUR CLIENTS\u2019 ACTIVITY. THE INCREASE IN DEPOSITS REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN CONSUMER DEPOSITS. THE INCREASE IN CUSTOMER AND OTHER PAYABLES PRIMARILY REFLECTED CLIENT ACTIVITY. THE INCREASE IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED REFLECTED CLIENT ACTIVITY IN U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS.  OUR TOTAL REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, ACCOUNTED FOR AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS, WERE $109.44 BILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019 AND $78.72 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2018, WHICH WERE 23% HIGHER AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019 AND 1% HIGHER AS OF DECEMBER 2018 THAN THE AVERAGE DAILY AMOUNT OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OVER THE RESPECTIVE QUARTERS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, THE INCREASE IN OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE AVERAGE DAILY AMOUNT OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS DURING THE QUARTER RESULTED FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF OUR AND OUR CLIENTS\u2019 ACTIVITY AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.  THE LEVEL OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FLUCTUATES BETWEEN AND WITHIN PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO PROVIDING CLIENTS WITH ACCESS TO HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL, SUCH AS LIQUID GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, THROUGH COLLATERALIZED FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  107  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

WE USE UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, INCLUDING U.S. AND  NON-U.S.  HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TO FINANCE LIQUID ASSETS AND FOR OTHER CASH MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. IN LIGHT OF REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, GROUP INC. NO LONGER ISSUES DEBT WITH AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR, OTHER THAN TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES. SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.  UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.  WE ISSUE UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR INVENTORY AND OTHER ASSETS AND TO FINANCE A PORTION OF OUR GCLA. UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, INCLUDING STRUCTURED NOTES, ARE RAISED THROUGH SYNDICATED U.S. REGISTERED OFFERINGS, U.S. REGISTERED AND RULE 144A MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAMS, OFFSHORE MEDIUM-TERM NOTE OFFERINGS AND OTHER DEBT OFFERINGS.

TO MITIGATE REFINANCING RISK, WE SEEK TO LIMIT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DEBT MATURING OVER THE COURSE OF ANY MONTHLY, QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL TIME HORIZON. WE ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO CONVERT A PORTION OF OUR UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS INTO FLOATING-RATE OBLIGATIONS TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATES. SEE NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.  SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY.  SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY IS A STABLE AND PERPETUAL SOURCE OF FUNDING. SEE NOTE 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY.  EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY CAPITAL  CAPITAL ADEQUACY IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO US. WE HAVE IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICY THAT PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK, DEFINES OBJECTIVES AND ESTABLISHES GUIDELINES TO ASSIST US IN MAINTAINING THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL IN BOTH  BUSINESS-AS-USUAL  AND STRESSED CONDITIONS.  EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  WE DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL BY CONSIDERING MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE RESULTS OF OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS, THE RESULTS OF RESOLUTION CAPITAL MODELS AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS RATING AGENCY GUIDELINES, SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS.  WE MANAGE OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND THE LEVELS OF OUR CAPITAL USAGE PRINCIPALLY BY SETTING LIMITS ON BALANCE SHEET ASSETS AND/OR LIMITS ON RISK, IN EACH CASE AT BOTH THE FIRMWIDE AND BUSINESS LEVELS.  WE PRINCIPALLY MANAGE THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL THROUGH ISSUANCES AND REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE MAY ALSO, FROM TIME TO TIME, ISSUE OR REPURCHASE OUR PREFERRED STOCK, JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS, AND OTHER SUBORDINATED DEBT OR OTHER FORMS OF CAPITAL AS BUSINESS CONDITIONS WARRANT. PRIOR TO ANY REPURCHASES, WE MUST RECEIVE CONFIRMATION THAT THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FRB) DOES NOT OBJECT TO SUCH CAPITAL ACTION. SEE NOTES 16 AND 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PREFERRED STOCK, JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS AND OTHER SUBORDINATED DEBT.  CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS.  AS PART OF CAPITAL PLANNING, WE PROJECT SOURCES AND USES OF CAPITAL GIVEN A RANGE OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING STRESSED CONDITIONS. OUR STRESS TESTING PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND MEASURE MATERIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK, AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES.  THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS.  \u2022  CAPITAL PLANNING.  OUR CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS INCORPORATES AN INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ENSURING THAT WE ARE APPROPRIATELY CAPITALIZED RELATIVE TO THE RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES. WE INCORPORATE STRESS SCENARIOS INTO OUR CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS WITH A GOAL OF HOLDING SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ENSURE WE REMAIN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AFTER EXPERIENCING A SEVERE STRESS EVENT. OUR ASSESSMENT OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY IS VIEWED IN TANDEM WITH OUR ASSESSMENT OF LIQUIDITY ADEQUACY AND IS INTEGRATED INTO OUR OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE, GOVERNANCE AND POLICY FRAMEWORK.  OUR CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS ALSO INCLUDES AN INTERNAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL ASSESSMENT. THIS ASSESSMENT INCORPORATES MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK. MARKET RISK IS CALCULATED BY USING  VALUE-AT-RISK  (VAR) CALCULATIONS SUPPLEMENTED BY RISK-BASED  ADD-ONS  WHICH INCLUDE RISKS RELATED TO RARE EVENTS (TAIL RISKS). CREDIT RISK UTILIZES ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT OUR COUNTERPARTIES\u2019 PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND THE SIZE OF OUR LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT. OPERATIONAL RISK IS CALCULATED BASED ON SCENARIOS INCORPORATING MULTIPLE TYPES OF OPERATIONAL FAILURES, AS WELL AS CONSIDERING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ACTUAL LOSS EXPERIENCE. BACKTESTING FOR MARKET RISK AND CREDIT RISK IS USED TO GAUGE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MODELS AT CAPTURING AND MEASURING RELEVANT RISKS.  \u2022  STRESS TESTING.  OUR STRESS TESTS INCORPORATE OUR INTERNALLY DESIGNED STRESS SCENARIOS, INCLUDING OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SEVERELY ADVERSE SCENARIO, AND THOSE REQUIRED UNDER CCAR AND DFAST, AND ARE DESIGNED TO CAPTURE OUR SPECIFIC VULNERABILITIES AND RISKS. WE PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR STRESS TEST PROCESSES AND A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS ON OUR WEBSITE AS DESCRIBED IN \u201cAVAILABLE INFORMATION.\u201d  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  110  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  AS REQUIRED BY THE FRB\u2019S ANNUAL CCAR RULES, WE SUBMIT A CAPITAL PLAN FOR REVIEW BY THE FRB. THE PURPOSE OF THE FRB\u2019S REVIEW IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST, FORWARD-LOOKING CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS THAT ACCOUNTS FOR OUR UNIQUE RISKS AND THAT PERMITS CONTINUED OPERATION DURING TIMES OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL STRESS.  THE FRB EVALUATES US BASED, IN PART, ON WHETHER WE HAVE THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO CONTINUE OPERATING UNDER THE BASELINE AND STRESS SCENARIOS PROVIDED BY THE FRB AND THOSE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY. THIS EVALUATION ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT OUR PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING RISK, OUR CONTROLS AND GOVERNANCE FOR CAPITAL PLANNING, AND OUR GUIDELINES FOR MAKING CAPITAL PLANNING DECISIONS. IN ADDITION, THE FRB EVALUATES OUR PLAN TO MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS (I.E., DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND REPURCHASES OR REDEMPTIONS OF STOCK, SUBORDINATED DEBT OR OTHER CAPITAL SECURITIES) AND ISSUE CAPITAL, ACROSS THE RANGE OF MACROECONOMIC SCENARIOS AND FIRM-SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS.  IN MARCH 2019, THE FRB REVISED ITS CCAR RULES RELATING TO THE QUALITATIVE CCAR REVIEW. ACCORDINGLY, BEGINNING WITH CCAR 2019, WHILE THE FRB EVALUATES OUR CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS, OUR CAPITAL PLAN IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO A POTENTIAL QUALITATIVE OBJECTION.  WITH RESPECT TO OUR 2019 CCAR SUBMISSION, THE FRB INFORMED US THAT IT DID NOT OBJECT TO OUR CAPITAL PLAN, WHICH INCLUDES THE RETURN OF UP TO $8.8 BILLION OF CAPITAL FROM THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 (2019 CCAR CYCLE). THE CAPITAL PLAN PROVIDES FOR UP TO $7.0 BILLION IN REPURCHASES OF OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK AND $1.8 BILLION IN TOTAL COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN OUR COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND FROM $0.85 TO $1.25 PER SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE RETURNED A TOTAL OF $1.14 BILLION OF CAPITAL, INCLUDING STOCK REPURCHASES OF $673 MILLION AND COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS OF $466 MILLION. OUR STOCK REPURCHASE AMOUNT WAS LESS THAN THE QUARTERLY AMOUNT OF $1.75 BILLION INCLUDED IN OUR CAPITAL PLAN SUBMISSION AND THE UNUTILIZED AMOUNT WILL BE CARRIED FORWARD TO THE REMAINING THREE QUARTERS OF THE 2019 CCAR CYCLE. WE MAY ELECT TO EXECUTE A PORTION OR ALL OF OUR CAPITAL ACTIONS, BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR CURRENT AND PROJECTED CAPITAL POSITION, AND CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. BASED ON THE FRB\u2019S 2019 CCAR RESULTS AND THE PROPOSED STRESS CAPITAL BUFFER (SCB) RULE, WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR CET1 RATIO REQUIREMENT WILL BE BETWEEN 12.5% TO 13.0% (EXCLUDING MANAGEMENT BUFFERS). THIS ESTIMATE IS BASED ON OUR CALCULATIONS AND OUR CURRENT INTERPRETATION OF THE PROPOSED SCB RULE AND MAY CHANGE WHEN THE RULE IS FINALIZED AND IMPLEMENTED. WE PUBLISHED A SUMMARY OF OUR ANNUAL DFAST RESULTS IN JUNE 2019. SEE \u201cAVAILABLE INFORMATION.\u201d  IN OCTOBER 2019, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DFAST RULES, WE SUBMITTED OUR  MID-CYCLE  DFAST RESULTS TO THE FRB AND PUBLISHED A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SEVERELY ADVERSE SCENARIO. THE FRB ELIMINATED THE REQUIREMENT TO CONDUCT THE MID-CYCLE DFAST BEGINNING IN 2020. WE ARE STILL REQUIRED TO CONDUCT A STRESS TEST ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND PUBLISH A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS. THE FRB ALSO CONDUCTS ITS OWN ANNUAL STRESS TESTS AND PUBLISHES A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN RESULTS. SEE \u201cAVAILABLE INFORMATION.\u201d  GS BANK USA WAS NOT REQUIRED TO CONDUCT ITS ANNUAL STRESS TEST IN 2019.  GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL (GSI) AND GSIB ALSO HAVE THEIR OWN CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS, WHICH INCORPORATES INTERNALLY DESIGNED STRESS TESTS AND THOSE REQUIRED UNDER THE PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY\u2019S (PRA) INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS.  CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN.  AS PART OF OUR COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICY, WE MAINTAIN A CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN. OUR CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING TO A PERCEIVED OR ACTUAL CAPITAL DEFICIENCY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IDENTIFICATION OF DRIVERS OF A CAPITAL DEFICIENCY, AS WELL AS MITIGANTS AND POTENTIAL ACTIONS. IT OUTLINES THE APPROPRIATE COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW DURING A CRISIS PERIOD, INCLUDING INTERNAL DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION, AS WELL AS TIMELY COMMUNICATION WITH EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS.  CAPITAL ATTRIBUTION.  WE ASSESS EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES\u2019 CAPITAL USAGE BASED ON OUR INTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF RISKS, WHICH INCORPORATES AN ATTRIBUTION OF ALL OF OUR RELEVANT REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THESE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE ALLOCATED USING OUR ATTRIBUTED EQUITY FRAMEWORK, WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION OUR MOST BINDING CAPITAL CONSTRAINTS. OUR MOST BINDING CAPITAL CONSTRAINT IS BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE FRB\u2019S ANNUAL STRESS TEST SCENARIOS WHICH INCLUDE THE STANDARDIZED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS.  WE ALSO ATTRIBUTE RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (RWAS) TO OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, APPROXIMATELY 55% OF RWAS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES AND APPROXIMATELY 50% OF RWAS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADVANCED CAPITAL RULES, WERE ATTRIBUTED TO OUR INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES SEGMENT AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING RWAS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO OUR INVESTING & LENDING SEGMENT. WE MANAGE THE LEVELS OF OUR CAPITAL USAGE BASED ON BALANCE SHEET AND RISK LIMITS, AS WELL AS CAPITAL RETURN ANALYSES OF OUR BUSINESSES BASED ON OUR CAPITAL ATTRIBUTION.  111  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  WE USE OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO HELP MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF COMMON EQUITY. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EFFECTED PRIMARILY THROUGH REGULAR OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES (WHICH MAY INCLUDE REPURCHASE PLANS DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH RULE  10B5-1),  THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF WHICH ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY OUR CURRENT AND PROJECTED CAPITAL POSITION AND OUR CAPITAL PLAN SUBMITTED TO THE FRB AS PART OF CCAR. THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF THE REPURCHASES MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE PREVAILING PRICE AND TRADING VOLUMES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  ON JULY 15, 2019, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF GROUP INC. (BOARD) AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL 50 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO OUR EXISTING SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM; HOWEVER, WE ARE ONLY PERMITTED TO MAKE REPURCHASES TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH REPURCHASES HAVE NOT BEEN OBJECTED TO BY THE FRB. AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, THE REMAINING SHARE AUTHORIZATION UNDER OUR EXISTING REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS 68.0 MILLION SHARES. SEE \u201cUNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\u201d IN PART II, ITEM 2 OF THIS FORM  10-Q  AND NOTE 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AND SEE ABOVE FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS.  RESOLUTION CAPITAL MODELS.  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR RESOLUTION PLANNING EFFORTS, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A RESOLUTION CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND POSITIONING FRAMEWORK, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT OUR MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES (GS BANK USA, GOLDMAN SACHS & CO. LLC (GS&CO.), GSI, GSIB, GOLDMAN SACHS JAPAN CO., LTD. (GSJCL), GOLDMAN SACHS ASSET MANAGEMENT, L.P. AND GOLDMAN SACHS ASSET MANAGEMENT INTERNATIONAL) HAVE ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT LOSS-ABSORBING CAPACITY (IN THE FORM OF EQUITY, SUBORDINATED DEBT AND UNSECURED SENIOR DEBT) SO THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO WIND-DOWN FOLLOWING A GROUP INC. BANKRUPTCY FILING IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR PREFERRED RESOLUTION STRATEGY.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A TRIGGERS AND ALERTS FRAMEWORK, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE BOARD WITH INFORMATION NEEDED TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON WHETHER AND WHEN TO COMMENCE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS FOR GROUP INC.  RATING AGENCY GUIDELINES  THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES ASSIGN CREDIT RATINGS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF GROUP INC., WHICH DIRECTLY ISSUES OR GUARANTEES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT OBLIGATIONS. GS&CO. AND GSI HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM ISSUER RATINGS BY CERTAIN CREDIT RATING AGENCIES. GS BANK USA AND GSIB HAVE ALSO BEEN ASSIGNED LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM ISSUER RATINGS, AS WELL AS RATINGS ON THEIR LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM BANK DEPOSITS. IN ADDITION, CREDIT RATING AGENCIES HAVE ASSIGNED RATINGS TO DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF GROUP INC.  THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL ARE AMONG THE MANY FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING OUR CREDIT RATINGS. EACH AGENCY HAS ITS OWN DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE CAPITAL AND METHODOLOGY FOR EVALUATING CAPITAL ADEQUACY, AND ASSESSMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON A COMBINATION OF FACTORS RATHER THAN A SINGLE CALCULATION. SEE \u201cRISK MANAGEMENT \u2014 LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT \u2014 CREDIT RATINGS\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT CREDIT RATINGS OF GROUP INC., GS BANK USA, GSIB, GS&CO. AND GSI.  CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL  WE ARE SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATED REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REGULATIONS OF THE FRB (CAPITAL FRAMEWORK). UNDER THE CAPITAL FRAMEWORK, WE ARE AN \u201cADVANCED APPROACH\u201d BANKING ORGANIZATION AND HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AS A GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANK  (G-SIB).  THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPITAL FRAMEWORK INCLUDE THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL BUFFERS AND  G-SIB  SURCHARGE. THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL BUFFERS, APPLICABLE TO US FOR 2019, INCLUDE THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER OF 2.5% AND THE COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER, WHICH THE FRB HAS SET TO ZERO PERCENT. IN ADDITION, THE  G-SIB  SURCHARGE APPLICABLE TO US AS OF JANUARY 2019 IS 2.5% BASED ON 2017 FINANCIAL DATA. BASED ON FINANCIAL DATA FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019, OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE IS THAT WE ARE ABOVE THE THRESHOLD FOR THE 3.0%  G-SIB  SURCHARGE. THE EARLIEST THIS SURCHARGE COULD BE REFLECTED IN OUR RATIO REQUIREMENTS IS JANUARY 2022. THE  G-SIB  SURCHARGE AND COUNTERCYCLICAL BUFFER IN THE FUTURE MAY DIFFER DUE TO ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FROM OUR REGULATORS AND/OR POSITIONAL CHANGES. SEE NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS AND LEVERAGE RATIOS, AND THE CAPITAL FRAMEWORK.  SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING OUR BANK AND BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, ARE SUBJECT TO SEPARATE REGULATION AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.

ON OCTOBER 29, 2019, THE U.K. PARLIAMENT AGREED TO HOLD A GENERAL ELECTION ON DECEMBER 12, 2019. IF THE WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT IS RATIFIED AHEAD OF JANUARY 31, 2020, THE TERMS OF THE EXTENSION WILL ALLOW THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE E.U. AT AN EARLIER DATE. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS, WITHOUT A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION TO THE PROCESS BY JANUARY 31, 2020, THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE U.K. WILL LEAVE THE E.U. WITHOUT A CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. OR ANY TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE, IN WHICH CASE FIRMS BASED IN THE U.K. WILL LOSE THEIR EXISTING ACCESS ARRANGEMENTS TO THE E.U. MARKETS. SUCH A SCENARIO IS REFERRED TO AS A \u201cHARD\u201d BREXIT.  WE ARE MONITORING THE ONGOING DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO BREXIT AND CONTINUE TO PREPARE FOR ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES, INCLUDING A HARD BREXIT, WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT WE MAINTAIN ACCESS TO E.U.

REPLACEMENT OF INTERBANK OFFERED RATES (IBORS), INCLUDING LIBOR.  CENTRAL BANKS AND REGULATORS IN A NUMBER OF MAJOR JURISDICTIONS (FOR EXAMPLE, U.S., U.K., E.U., SWITZERLAND AND JAPAN) HAVE CONVENED WORKING GROUPS TO FIND, AND IMPLEMENT THE TRANSITION TO, SUITABLE REPLACEMENTS FOR IBORS. THE U.K. FCA, WHICH REGULATES LIBOR, HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL NOT COMPEL PANEL BANKS TO CONTRIBUTE TO LIBOR AFTER 2021. THE E.U. BENCHMARKS REGULATION IMPOSED CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH ONLY COMPLIANT BENCHMARKS MAY BE USED IN NEW CONTRACTS AFTER 2021. WE HAVE CREATED A PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES ON ACHIEVING AN ORDERLY TRANSITION FROM IBORS TO ALTERNATIVE RISK-FREE REFERENCE RATES FOR US AND OUR CLIENTS. AS PART OF THIS TRANSITION, WE CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH OUR REGULATORS AND CLIENTS, AS WELL AS PARTICIPATE IN CENTRAL BANK AND SECTOR WORKING GROUPS. IN ADDITION, DURING 2019, WE ISSUED DEBT AND DEPOSITS LINKED TO THE SECURED OVERNIGHT FUNDING RATE AND STERLING OVERNIGHT INTERBANK AVERAGE RATE, AS WELL AS PREFERRED STOCK WITH THE RATE RESET BASED ON  5-YEAR  U.S. TREASURY RATES.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES, SEE \u201cOVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT.\u201d OUR RISKS INCLUDE THE RISKS ACROSS OUR RISK CATEGORIES, REGIONS OR GLOBAL BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS THOSE WHICH HAVE UNCERTAIN OUTCOMES AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, OUR LIQUIDITY AND OUR REPUTATION.

OVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT  OVERVIEW  WE BELIEVE THAT EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK THAT EMPLOYS A COMPREHENSIVE, INTEGRATED APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT, AND IS DESIGNED TO ENABLE COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES THROUGH WHICH WE IDENTIFY, ASSESS, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR ACTIVITIES. THESE RISKS INCLUDE LIQUIDITY, MARKET, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, MODEL, LEGAL, COMPLIANCE, CONDUCT, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISK EXPOSURES. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE IS BUILT AROUND THREE CORE COMPONENTS: GOVERNANCE, PROCESSES AND PEOPLE.  GOVERNANCE.  RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE STARTS WITH THE BOARD, WHICH BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH ITS COMMITTEES, INCLUDING ITS RISK COMMITTEE, OVERSEES OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK. THE BOARD IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ANNUAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF OUR RISK APPETITE STATEMENT. THE RISK APPETITE STATEMENT DESCRIBES THE LEVELS AND TYPES OF RISK WE ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT OR TO AVOID, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE OUR STRATEGIC BUSINESS OBJECTIVES, WHILE REMAINING IN COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.  THE BOARD RECEIVES REGULAR BRIEFINGS ON FIRMWIDE RISKS, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK AND MODEL RISK FROM OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, AND ON COMPLIANCE RISK AND CONDUCT RISK FROM THE HEAD OF COMPLIANCE, ON LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS FROM THE GENERAL COUNSEL, AND ON OTHER MATTERS IMPACTING OUR REPUTATION FROM THE CHAIR OF OUR FIRMWIDE CLIENT AND BUSINESS STANDARDS COMMITTEE AND OUR FIRMWIDE REPUTATIONAL RISK COMMITTEE. THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND TO THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD. AS PART OF THE REVIEW OF THE FIRMWIDE RISK PORTFOLIO, THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER REGULARLY ADVISES THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF RELEVANT RISK METRICS AND MATERIAL EXPOSURES, INCLUDING RISK LIMITS AND THRESHOLDS ESTABLISHED IN OUR RISK APPETITE STATEMENT.  THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND CORE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES ARE OVERSEEN BY ENTERPRISE RISK, WHICH REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF RISK OFFICER, AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT OUR ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK PROVIDES THE BOARD, OUR RISK COMMITTEES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT WITH A CONSISTENT AND INTEGRATED APPROACH TO MANAGING OUR VARIOUS RISKS IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH OUR RISK APPETITE.  OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, AS WELL AS TREASURY, OPERATIONS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY, ARE CONSIDERED OUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE. THEY ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE OUTCOMES OF OUR RISK-GENERATING ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS FOR ASSESSING AND MANAGING THOSE RISKS WITHIN OUR RISK APPETITE.  OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS ARE CONSIDERED OUR SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE AND PROVIDE INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT, OVERSIGHT AND CHALLENGE OF THE RISKS TAKEN BY OUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE, AS WELL AS LEAD AND PARTICIPATE IN RISK COMMITTEES. INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS INCLUDE COMPLIANCE, CONFLICTS RESOLUTION, CONTROLLERS, CREDIT RISK, ENTERPRISE RISK, LEGAL, LIQUIDITY RISK, MARKET RISK, MODEL RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK AND TAX.  INTERNAL AUDIT IS CONSIDERED OUR THIRD LINE OF DEFENSE AND REPORTS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD AND ADMINISTRATIVELY TO OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. INTERNAL AUDIT INCLUDES PROFESSIONALS WITH A BROAD RANGE OF AUDIT AND INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING RISK MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE. INTERNAL AUDIT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSING AND VALIDATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY CONTROLS, INCLUDING THOSE WITHIN THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, AND PROVIDING TIMELY REPORTING TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORS.  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  118  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  THE THREE LINES OF DEFENSE STRUCTURE PROMOTES THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF FIRST LINE RISK TAKERS, PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR EFFECTIVE CHALLENGE BY THE SECOND LINE AND EMPOWERS INDEPENDENT REVIEW FROM THE THIRD LINE. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE OTHER FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, THAT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR CONTROL ENVIRONMENT.  OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE PROVIDES THE PROTOCOL AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR  DECISION-MAKING  ON RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUES AND ENSURES IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE DECISIONS. WE MAKE EXTENSIVE USE OF RISK COMMITTEES THAT MEET REGULARLY AND SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT MEANS TO FACILITATE AND FOSTER ONGOING DISCUSSIONS TO MANAGE AND MITIGATE RISKS.  WE MAINTAIN STRONG AND PROACTIVE COMMUNICATION ABOUT RISK AND WE HAVE A CULTURE OF COLLABORATION IN DECISION-MAKING AMONG OUR FIRST AND SECOND LINES OF DEFENSE, COMMITTEES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. WHILE OUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGEMENT OF THEIR RISK, WE DEDICATE EXTENSIVE RESOURCES TO OUR SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE IN ORDER TO ENSURE A STRONG OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE AND AN APPROPRIATE SEGREGATION OF DUTIES. WE REGULARLY REINFORCE OUR STRONG CULTURE OF ESCALATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS ALL FUNCTIONS.  PROCESSES.  WE MAINTAIN VARIOUS PROCESSES THAT ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING, ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING OUR RISKS.  TO EFFECTIVELY ASSESS AND MONITOR OUR RISKS, WE MAINTAIN A DAILY DISCIPLINE OF MARKING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVENTORY TO CURRENT MARKET LEVELS. WE CARRY OUR INVENTORY AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN VALUATION REFLECTED IMMEDIATELY IN OUR RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND IN NET REVENUES. WE DO SO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THIS DISCIPLINE IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR ASSESSING AND MANAGING RISK AND THAT IT PROVIDES TRANSPARENT AND REALISTIC INSIGHT INTO OUR INVENTORY EXPOSURES.  AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS IS FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTING. IT ALLOWS US TO QUANTIFY OUR EXPOSURE TO TAIL RISKS, HIGHLIGHT POTENTIAL LOSS CONCENTRATIONS, UNDERTAKE RISK/REWARD ANALYSIS, AND ASSESS AND MITIGATE OUR RISK POSITIONS. FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS ARE PERFORMED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF OUR VULNERABILITIES AND IDIOSYNCRATIC RISKS COMBINING FINANCIAL AND NONFINANCIAL RISKS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CREDIT, MARKET, LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING, OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE, STRATEGIC, SYSTEMIC AND EMERGING RISKS INTO A SINGLE COMBINED SCENARIO. WE ALSO PERFORM AD HOC STRESS TESTS IN ANTICIPATION OF MARKET EVENTS OR CONDITIONS. STRESS TESTS ARE ALSO USED TO ASSESS CAPITAL ADEQUACY AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS. SEE \u201cEQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY CAPITAL \u2014 EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  WE ALSO APPLY A RIGOROUS FRAMEWORK OF LIMITS AND THRESHOLDS TO CONTROL AND MONITOR RISK ACROSS TRANSACTIONS, PRODUCTS, BUSINESSES AND MARKETS. THE BOARD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH ITS RISK COMMITTEE, APPROVES LIMITS AND THRESHOLDS INCLUDED IN OUR RISK APPETITE STATEMENT AT FIRMWIDE, BUSINESS AND PRODUCT LEVELS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRMWIDE ENTERPRISE RISK COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROVING OUR RISK LIMITS FRAMEWORK, SUBJECT TO THE OVERALL LIMITS APPROVED BY THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD, AND MONITORING THESE LIMITS ON A DAILY BASIS.  THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROVING LIMITS AT FIRMWIDE, BUSINESS AND PRODUCT LEVELS. CERTAIN LIMITS MAY BE SET AT LEVELS THAT WILL REQUIRE PERIODIC ADJUSTMENT, RATHER THAN AT LEVELS THAT REFLECT OUR MAXIMUM RISK APPETITE. THIS FOSTERS AN ONGOING DIALOGUE ABOUT RISK AMONG OUR FIRST AND SECOND LINES OF DEFENSE, COMMITTEES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS RAPID ESCALATION OF  RISK-RELATED  MATTERS. ADDITIONALLY, THROUGH DELEGATED AUTHORITY FROM THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE, MARKET RISK SETS LIMITS AT CERTAIN PRODUCT AND DESK LEVELS, AND CREDIT RISK SETS LIMITS FOR INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES, COUNTERPARTIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES, INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES. LIMITS ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY AND AMENDED ON A PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY BASIS TO REFLECT CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS, BUSINESS CONDITIONS OR RISK TOLERANCE.  ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF OUR POSITIONS IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT PROCESS. PROACTIVE MITIGATION OF OUR MARKET AND CREDIT EXPOSURES MINIMIZES THE RISK THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO TAKE OUTSIZED ACTIONS DURING PERIODS OF STRESS.  EFFECTIVE RISK REPORTING AND RISK DECISION-MAKING DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE AT THE RIGHT TIME. AS SUCH, WE FOCUS ON THE RIGOR AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RISK SYSTEMS, WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ENSURING THAT OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS ARE COMPREHENSIVE, RELIABLE AND TIMELY. WE DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT TIME AND RESOURCES TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY TO ENSURE THAT IT CONSISTENTLY PROVIDES US WITH COMPLETE, ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION.  119  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  PEOPLE  . EVEN THE BEST TECHNOLOGY SERVES ONLY AS A TOOL FOR HELPING TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS IN REAL TIME ABOUT THE RISKS WE ARE TAKING. ULTIMATELY, EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIRES OUR PEOPLE TO INTERPRET OUR RISK DATA ON AN ONGOING AND TIMELY BASIS AND ADJUST RISK POSITIONS ACCORDINGLY. THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR PROFESSIONALS, AND THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NUANCES AND LIMITATIONS OF EACH RISK MEASURE, GUIDES US IN ASSESSING EXPOSURES AND MAINTAINING THEM WITHIN PRUDENT LEVELS.  WE REINFORCE A CULTURE OF EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT, CONSISTENT WITH OUR RISK APPETITE, IN OUR TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS IN THE WAY WE EVALUATE PERFORMANCE, AND RECOGNIZE AND REWARD OUR PEOPLE. OUR TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, INCLUDING CERTAIN SESSIONS LED BY OUR MOST SENIOR LEADERS, ARE FOCUSED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RISK MANAGEMENT, CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND REPUTATIONAL EXCELLENCE. AS PART OF OUR ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW PROCESS, WE ASSESS REPUTATIONAL EXCELLENCE, INCLUDING HOW AN EMPLOYEE EXERCISES GOOD RISK MANAGEMENT AND REPUTATIONAL JUDGMENT, AND ADHERES TO OUR CODE OF CONDUCT AND COMPLIANCE POLICIES. OUR REVIEW AND REWARD PROCESSES ARE DESIGNED TO COMMUNICATE AND REINFORCE TO OUR PROFESSIONALS THE LINK BETWEEN BEHAVIOR AND HOW PEOPLE ARE RECOGNIZED, THE NEED TO FOCUS ON OUR CLIENTS AND OUR REPUTATION, AND THE NEED TO ALWAYS ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR HIGHEST STANDARDS.  STRUCTURE  ULTIMATE OVERSIGHT OF RISK IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR BOARD. THE BOARD OVERSEES RISK BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH ITS COMMITTEES, INCLUDING ITS RISK COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A SERIES OF COMMITTEES WITH SPECIFIC RISK MANAGEMENT MANDATES THAT HAVE OVERSIGHT OR DECISION-MAKING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP GENERALLY CONSISTS OF SENIOR MANAGERS FROM BOTH OUR FIRST AND SECOND LINES OF DEFENSE. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES FOR THESE COMMITTEES TO ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE INFORMATION BARRIERS ARE IN PLACE. OUR PRIMARY RISK COMMITTEES, MOST OF WHICH ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL  SUB-COMMITTEES  OR WORKING GROUPS, ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. IN ADDITION TO THESE COMMITTEES, WE HAVE OTHER RISK COMMITTEES THAT PROVIDE OVERSIGHT FOR DIFFERENT BUSINESSES, ACTIVITIES, PRODUCTS, REGIONS AND ENTITIES. ALL OF OUR COMMITTEES HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONSIDERING THE IMPACT OF TRANSACTIONS AND ACTIVITIES, WHICH THEY OVERSEE, ON OUR REPUTATION.  MEMBERSHIP OF OUR RISK COMMITTEES IS REVIEWED REGULARLY AND UPDATED TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT MEMBERS SERVE ON THE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES VARIES AS DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND BASED ON THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MEMBERS.  THE CHART BELOW PRESENTS AN OVERVIEW OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE.  MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE.  THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE OVERSEES OUR GLOBAL ACTIVITIES.

THE TERM \u201cCONFLICT OF INTEREST\u201d DOES NOT HAVE A UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED MEANING, AND CONFLICTS CAN ARISE IN MANY FORMS WITHIN A BUSINESS OR BETWEEN BUSINESSES. THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL CONFLICTS, AS WELL AS COMPLYING WITH OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, IS SHARED BY ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES.  WE HAVE A MULTILAYERED APPROACH TO RESOLVING CONFLICTS AND ADDRESSING REPUTATIONAL RISK. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT OVERSEES POLICIES RELATED TO CONFLICTS RESOLUTION, AND, IN CONJUNCTION WITH CONFLICTS RESOLUTION, LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE, THE FIRMWIDE CLIENT AND BUSINESS STANDARDS COMMITTEE, AND OTHER INTERNAL COMMITTEES, FORMULATES POLICIES, STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES, AND ASSISTS IN MAKING JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE APPROPRIATE RESOLUTION OF PARTICULAR CONFLICTS. RESOLVING POTENTIAL CONFLICTS NECESSARILY DEPENDS ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF A PARTICULAR SITUATION AND THE APPLICATION OF EXPERIENCED AND INFORMED JUDGMENT.  AS A GENERAL MATTER, CONFLICTS RESOLUTION REVIEWS FINANCING AND ADVISORY ASSIGNMENTS IN INVESTMENT BANKING AND CERTAIN OF OUR INVESTING, LENDING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE VARIOUS TRANSACTION OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES, SUCH AS THE FIRMWIDE CAPITAL, COMMITMENTS AND SUITABILITY COMMITTEES AND OTHER COMMITTEES THAT ALSO REVIEW NEW UNDERWRITINGS, LOANS, INVESTMENTS AND STRUCTURED PRODUCTS. THESE GROUPS AND COMMITTEES WORK WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COUNSEL AND COMPLIANCE TO EVALUATE AND ADDRESS ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CONFLICTS. CONFLICTS RESOLUTION REPORTS TO OUR PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER.  WE REGULARLY ASSESS OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT ADDRESS CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN AN EFFORT TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HIGHEST ETHICAL STANDARDS AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS.  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  122  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  OVERVIEW  LIQUIDITY RISK IS THE RISK THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO FUND OURSELVES OR MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN THE EVENT OF FIRM-SPECIFIC, BROADER INDUSTRY OR MARKET LIQUIDITY STRESS EVENTS. WE HAVE IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE AND CONSERVATIVE SET OF LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING POLICIES. OUR PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE IS TO BE ABLE TO FUND OURSELVES AND TO ENABLE OUR CORE BUSINESSES TO CONTINUE TO SERVE CLIENTS AND GENERATE REVENUES, EVEN UNDER ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES.  TREASURY, WHICH REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEVELOPING, MANAGING AND EXECUTING OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING STRATEGY WITHIN OUR RISK APPETITE.  LIQUIDITY RISK, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND TREASURY, AND REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF RISK OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING OUR LIQUIDITY RISK THROUGH FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT ACROSS OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF STRESS TESTING AND LIMITS FRAMEWORKS.  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES  WE MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK ACCORDING TO THREE PRINCIPLES: (I) HOLD SUFFICIENT EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE FORM OF GCLA TO COVER OUTFLOWS DURING A STRESSED PERIOD, (II) MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT AND (III) MAINTAIN A VIABLE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN.  GCLA.  GCLA IS LIQUIDITY THAT WE MAINTAIN TO MEET A BROAD RANGE OF POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS AND COLLATERAL NEEDS IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. A PRIMARY LIQUIDITY PRINCIPLE IS TO  PRE-FUND  OUR ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL NEEDS DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND HOLD THIS LIQUIDITY IN THE FORM OF UNENCUMBERED, HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES AND CASH. WE BELIEVE THAT THE SECURITIES HELD IN OUR GCLA WOULD BE READILY CONVERTIBLE TO CASH IN A MATTER OF DAYS, THROUGH LIQUIDATION, BY ENTERING INTO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OR FROM MATURITIES OF RESALE AGREEMENTS, AND THAT THIS CASH WOULD ALLOW US TO MEET IMMEDIATE OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT NEEDING TO SELL OTHER ASSETS OR DEPEND ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM CREDIT-SENSITIVE MARKETS.  OUR GCLA REFLECTS THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES.  \u2022  THE FIRST DAYS OR WEEKS OF A LIQUIDITY CRISIS ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO A COMPANY\u2019S SURVIVAL;  \u2022  FOCUS MUST BE MAINTAINED ON ALL POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS, NOT JUST DISRUPTIONS TO FINANCING FLOWS. OUR BUSINESSES ARE DIVERSE, AND OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARE DETERMINED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET MOVEMENTS, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND CLIENT COMMITMENTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT;  \u2022  DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, CREDIT-SENSITIVE FUNDING, INCLUDING UNSECURED DEBT, CERTAIN DEPOSITS AND SOME TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING AGREEMENTS, MAY BE UNAVAILABLE, AND THE TERMS (E.G., INTEREST RATES, COLLATERAL PROVISIONS AND TENOR) OR AVAILABILITY OF OTHER TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING MAY CHANGE AND CERTAIN DEPOSITS MAY BE WITHDRAWN; AND  \u2022  AS A RESULT OF OUR POLICY TO  PRE-FUND  LIQUIDITY THAT WE ESTIMATE MAY BE NEEDED IN A CRISIS, WE HOLD MORE UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES AND HAVE LARGER DEBT BALANCES THAN OUR BUSINESSES WOULD OTHERWISE REQUIRE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR LIQUIDITY IS STRONGER WITH GREATER BALANCES OF HIGHLY LIQUID UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES, EVEN THOUGH IT INCREASES OUR TOTAL ASSETS AND OUR FUNDING COSTS.  WE MAINTAIN OUR GCLA ACROSS GROUP INC., GOLDMAN SACHS FUNDING LLC (FUNDING IHC) AND GROUP INC.\u2019S MAJOR BROKER-DEALER AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES, ASSET TYPES AND CLEARING AGENTS TO PROVIDE US WITH SUFFICIENT OPERATING LIQUIDITY TO ENSURE TIMELY SETTLEMENT IN ALL MAJOR MARKETS, EVEN IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION TO THE GCLA, WE MAINTAIN CASH BALANCES AND SECURITIES IN SEVERAL OF OUR OTHER ENTITIES, PRIMARILY FOR USE IN SPECIFIC CURRENCIES, ENTITIES OR JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR GCLA PROVIDES US WITH A RESILIENT SOURCE OF FUNDS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN ADVANCE OF POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS AND GIVES US SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN MANAGING THROUGH A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.  ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT.  OUR LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE WE HAVE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF FINANCING, EVEN WHEN FUNDING MARKETS EXPERIENCE PERSISTENT STRESS. WE MANAGE THE MATURITIES AND DIVERSITY OF OUR FUNDING ACROSS MARKETS, PRODUCTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND SEEK TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSIFIED FUNDING PROFILE WITH AN APPROPRIATE TENOR, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CHARACTERISTICS AND LIQUIDITY PROFILE OF OUR ASSETS.  OUR APPROACH TO ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT INCLUDES.  \u2022  CONSERVATIVELY MANAGING THE OVERALL CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR FUNDING BOOK, WITH A FOCUS ON MAINTAINING LONG-TERM, DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF FUNDING IN EXCESS OF OUR CURRENT REQUIREMENTS. SEE \u201cBALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING SOURCES \u2014 FUNDING SOURCES\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION;  123  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  \u2022  ACTIVELY MANAGING AND MONITORING OUR ASSET BASE, WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE LIQUIDITY, HOLDING PERIOD AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND ASSETS ON A SECURED BASIS. WE ASSESS OUR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND OUR ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE ASSETS IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT WHILE APPROPRIATELY MANAGING RISK. THIS ENABLES US TO DETERMINE THE MOST APPROPRIATE FUNDING PRODUCTS AND TENORS. SEE \u201cBALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING SOURCES \u2014 BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT PROCESS AND \u201c\u2014 FUNDING SOURCES \u2014 SECURED FUNDING\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT ASSET CLASSES THAT MAY BE HARDER TO FUND ON A SECURED BASIS; AND  \u2022  RAISING SECURED AND UNSECURED FINANCING THAT HAS A LONG TENOR RELATIVE TO THE LIQUIDITY PROFILE OF OUR ASSETS. THIS REDUCES THE RISK THAT OUR LIABILITIES WILL COME DUE IN ADVANCE OF OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE LIQUIDITY FROM THE SALE OF OUR ASSETS. BECAUSE WE MAINTAIN A HIGHLY LIQUID BALANCE SHEET, THE HOLDING PERIOD OF CERTAIN OF OUR ASSETS MAY BE MATERIALLY SHORTER THAN THEIR CONTRACTUAL MATURITY DATES.  OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT WE MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO FUND OUR ASSETS AND MEET OUR CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS IN NORMAL TIMES, AS WELL AS DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS. THROUGH OUR DYNAMIC BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT PROCESS, WE USE ACTUAL AND PROJECTED ASSET BALANCES TO DETERMINE SECURED AND UNSECURED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FUNDING PLANS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE FIRMWIDE ASSET LIABILITY COMMITTEE. IN ADDITION, OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS ANALYZE, AND THE FIRMWIDE ASSET LIABILITY COMMITTEE REVIEWS, OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL CAPITAL POSITION (UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS PLUS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY) SO THAT WE MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF LONG-TERM FUNDING THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM FINANCING REQUIREMENTS. IN A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, WE WOULD FIRST USE OUR GCLA IN ORDER TO AVOID RELIANCE ON ASSET SALES (OTHER THAN OUR GCLA). HOWEVER, WE RECOGNIZE THAT ORDERLY ASSET SALES MAY BE PRUDENT OR NECESSARY IN A SEVERE OR PERSISTENT LIQUIDITY CRISIS.  SUBSIDIARY FUNDING POLICIES  THE MAJORITY OF OUR UNSECURED FUNDING IS RAISED BY GROUP INC., WHICH LENDS THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO FUNDING IHC AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE REGULATED, TO MEET THEIR ASSET FINANCING, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC. PROVIDES ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES WITH THE NECESSARY CAPITAL TO MEET THEIR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH TO SUBSIDIARY FUNDING ARE ENHANCED CONTROL AND GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. FUNDING IS ALSO RAISED AT THE SUBSIDIARY LEVEL THROUGH A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING DEPOSITS, SECURED FUNDING AND UNSECURED BORROWINGS.  OUR INTERCOMPANY FUNDING POLICIES ASSUME THAT A SUBSIDIARY\u2019S FUNDS OR SECURITIES ARE NOT FREELY AVAILABLE TO ITS PARENT, FUNDING IHC OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS (I) LEGALLY PROVIDED FOR AND (II) THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY, TAX OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS. IN PARTICULAR, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. OR FUNDING IHC. REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ASSUME THAT THE CAPITAL PROVIDED TO OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES IS NOT AVAILABLE TO GROUP INC. OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND ANY OTHER FINANCING PROVIDED TO OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES IS NOT AVAILABLE TO GROUP INC. OR FUNDING IHC UNTIL THE MATURITY OF SUCH FINANCING.  GROUP INC. HAS PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF EQUITY AND SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, GROUP INC. HAD $31.31 BILLION OF EQUITY AND SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS INVESTED IN GS&CO., ITS PRINCIPAL U.S. REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER; $41.46 BILLION INVESTED IN GSI, A REGULATED U.K. BROKER-DEALER; $2.92 BILLION INVESTED IN GSJCL, A REGULATED JAPANESE BROKER-DEALER; $33.15 BILLION INVESTED IN GS BANK USA, A REGULATED NEW YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANK; AND $4.02 BILLION INVESTED IN GSIB, A REGULATED U.K. BANK. GROUP INC. ALSO PROVIDED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, $104.37 BILLION OF UNSUBORDINATED LOANS (INCLUDING SECURED LOANS OF $19.55 BILLION) AND $14.03 BILLION OF COLLATERAL AND CASH DEPOSITS TO THESE ENTITIES, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH WAS TO GS&CO., GSI AND GSJCL, AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019. IN ADDITION, AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, GROUP INC. HAD SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL INVESTED IN AND LOANS TO ITS OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.  CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN.  WE MAINTAIN A CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING TO A LIQUIDITY CRISIS SITUATION OR PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS. OUR CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN OUTLINES A LIST OF POTENTIAL RISK FACTORS, KEY REPORTS AND METRICS THAT ARE REVIEWED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO ASSIST IN ASSESSING THE SEVERITY OF, AND MANAGING THROUGH, A LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND/OR MARKET DISLOCATION. THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN ALSO DESCRIBES IN DETAIL OUR POTENTIAL RESPONSES IF OUR ASSESSMENTS INDICATE THAT WE HAVE ENTERED A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, WHICH INCLUDE  PRE-FUNDING  FOR WHAT WE ESTIMATE WILL BE OUR POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL NEEDS, AS WELL AS UTILIZING SECONDARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. MITIGANTS AND ACTION ITEMS TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC RISKS WHICH MAY ARISE ARE ALSO DESCRIBED AND ASSIGNED TO INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTION.  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  124  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN IDENTIFIES KEY GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS TO FOSTER EFFECTIVE COORDINATION, CONTROL AND DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION, ALL OF WHICH ARE CRITICAL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF A CRISIS OR PERIOD OF MARKET STRESS. THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN ALSO PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THESE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS, WHICH INCLUDE MAKING AND DISSEMINATING KEY DECISIONS, COORDINATING ALL CONTINGENCY ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE CRISIS OR PERIOD OF MARKET STRESS, IMPLEMENTING LIQUIDITY MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES AND MANAGING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION.  STRESS TESTS  IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE SIZE OF OUR GCLA, WE USE AN INTERNAL LIQUIDITY MODEL, REFERRED TO AS THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW, WHICH CAPTURES AND QUANTIFIES OUR LIQUIDITY RISKS. WE ALSO CONSIDER OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AN ASSESSMENT OF OUR POTENTIAL INTRADAY LIQUIDITY NEEDS THROUGH AN ADDITIONAL INTERNAL LIQUIDITY MODEL, REFERRED TO AS THE INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL, THE RESULTS OF OUR LONG-TERM STRESS TESTING MODELS, OUR RESOLUTION LIQUIDITY MODELS AND OTHER APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF OUR CONDITION, AS WELL AS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE RESULTS OF THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW, THE INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL, THE LONG-TERM STRESS TESTING MODELS AND THE RESOLUTION LIQUIDITY MODELS ARE REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT ON A REGULAR BASIS. WE ALSO PERFORM FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS. SEE \u201cOVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR INFORMATION ABOUT FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS.  MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW.  OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW IS BASED ON CONDUCTING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS THAT INCLUDE COMBINATIONS OF MARKET-WIDE AND FIRM-SPECIFIC STRESS. THESE SCENARIOS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE FOLLOWING QUALITATIVE ELEMENTS.  \u2022  SEVERELY CHALLENGED MARKET ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING LOW CONSUMER AND CORPORATE CONFIDENCE, FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY, ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES, INCLUDING POTENTIAL DECLINES IN EQUITY MARKETS AND WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS; AND  \u2022  A FIRM-SPECIFIC CRISIS POTENTIALLY TRIGGERED BY MATERIAL LOSSES, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, LITIGATION, EXECUTIVE DEPARTURE, AND/OR A RATINGS DOWNGRADE.  THE FOLLOWING ARE KEY MODELING ELEMENTS OF OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW.  \u2022  LIQUIDITY NEEDS OVER A  30-DAY  SCENARIO;  \u2022  A  TWO-NOTCH  DOWNGRADE OF OUR LONG-TERM SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT RATINGS;  \u2022  A COMBINATION OF CONTRACTUAL OUTFLOWS, SUCH AS UPCOMING MATURITIES OF UNSECURED DEBT, AND CONTINGENT OUTFLOWS (E.G., ACTIONS, THOUGH NOT CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED, WE MAY DEEM NECESSARY IN A CRISIS). WE ASSUME THAT MOST CONTINGENT OUTFLOWS WILL OCCUR WITHIN THE INITIAL DAYS AND WEEKS OF A CRISIS;  \u2022  NO ISSUANCE OF EQUITY OR UNSECURED DEBT;  \u2022  NO SUPPORT FROM ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING FACILITIES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACCESS TO VARIOUS CENTRAL BANK FUNDING PROGRAMS, WE DO NOT ASSUME RELIANCE ON ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF FUNDING IN A LIQUIDITY CRISIS; AND  \u2022  NO ASSET LIQUIDATION EXCEPT RELATING TO GCLA OR HEDGING ACTIVITIES.  THE POTENTIAL CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS COVERED IN OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW INCLUDE.  UNSECURED FUNDING  \u2022  CONTRACTUAL: ALL UPCOMING MATURITIES OF UNSECURED LONG-TERM DEBT, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER UNSECURED FUNDING PRODUCTS. WE ASSUME THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO ISSUE NEW UNSECURED DEBT OR ROLL OVER ANY MATURING DEBT.  \u2022  CONTINGENT: REPURCHASES OF OUR OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AS A MARKET MAKER.  DEPOSITS  \u2022  CONTRACTUAL: ALL UPCOMING MATURITIES OF TERM DEPOSITS. WE ASSUME THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO RAISE NEW TERM DEPOSITS OR ROLL OVER ANY MATURING TERM DEPOSITS.  \u2022  CONTINGENT: PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS OF DEPOSITS THAT HAVE NO CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. THE WITHDRAWAL ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE TYPE OF DEPOSIT, WHETHER THE DEPOSIT IS INSURED OR UNINSURED, AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEPOSITOR.  SECURED FUNDING  \u2022  CONTRACTUAL: A PORTION OF UPCOMING CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES OF SECURED FUNDING DUE TO EITHER THE INABILITY TO REFINANCE OR THE ABILITY TO REFINANCE ONLY AT WIDER HAIRCUTS (I.E., ON TERMS WHICH REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL). OUR ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, COUNTERPARTY ROLL PROBABILITIES (OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE COUNTERPARTY\u2019S LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINUING TO PROVIDE FUNDING ON A SECURED BASIS AT THE MATURITY OF THE TRADE) AND COUNTERPARTY CONCENTRATION.  \u2022  CONTINGENT: ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL FOR FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, WHICH WOULD NECESSITATE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL POSTINGS UNDER THOSE TRANSACTIONS.  125  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OTC DERIVATIVES  \u2022  CONTINGENT: COLLATERAL POSTINGS TO COUNTERPARTIES DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF OUR OTC DERIVATIVES, EXCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE CLEARED AND SETTLED THROUGH CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES  (OTC-CLEARED).  \u2022  CONTINGENT: OTHER OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL RELATED TO OTC DERIVATIVES, EXCLUDING  OTC-CLEARED,  INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF TRADE TERMINATIONS, COLLATERAL SUBSTITUTIONS, COLLATERAL DISPUTES, LOSS OF REHYPOTHECATION RIGHTS, COLLATERAL CALLS OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS REQUIRED BY A  TWO-NOTCH  DOWNGRADE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, AND COLLATERAL THAT HAS NOT BEEN CALLED BY COUNTERPARTIES, BUT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM.  EXCHANGE-TRADED AND  OTC-CLEARED  DERIVATIVES  \u2022  CONTINGENT: VARIATION MARGIN POSTINGS REQUIRED DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF OUR OUTSTANDING EXCHANGE-TRADED AND  OTC-CLEARED  DERIVATIVES.  \u2022  CONTINGENT: AN INCREASE IN INITIAL MARGIN AND GUARANTY FUND REQUIREMENTS BY DERIVATIVE CLEARING HOUSES.  CUSTOMER CASH AND SECURITIES  \u2022  CONTINGENT: LIQUIDITY OUTFLOWS IN OUR PRIME BROKERAGE BUSINESS, INCLUDING WITHDRAWALS OF CUSTOMER CREDIT BALANCES, AND A REDUCTION IN CUSTOMER SHORT POSITIONS, WHICH MAY SERVE AS A FUNDING SOURCE FOR LONG POSITIONS.  SECURITIES  \u2022  CONTINGENT: LIQUIDITY OUTFLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCTION OR COMPOSITION CHANGE IN OUR SHORT POSITIONS, WHICH MAY SERVE AS A FUNDING SOURCE FOR LONG POSITIONS.  UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS  \u2022  CONTINGENT: DRAWS ON OUR UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS. DRAW ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TYPE OF COMMITMENT AND COUNTERPARTY.  OTHER  \u2022  OTHER LARGE CASH OUTFLOWS THAT COULD OCCUR IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT.  INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL.  OUR INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL MEASURES OUR INTRADAY LIQUIDITY NEEDS USING A SCENARIO ANALYSIS CHARACTERIZED BY THE SAME QUALITATIVE ELEMENTS AS OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW. THE MODEL ASSESSES THE RISK OF INCREASED INTRADAY LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS DURING A SCENARIO WHERE ACCESS TO SOURCES OF INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MAY BECOME CONSTRAINED.  THE FOLLOWING ARE KEY MODELING ELEMENTS OF OUR INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL.  \u2022  LIQUIDITY NEEDS OVER A  ONE-DAY  SETTLEMENT PERIOD;  \u2022  DELAYS IN RECEIPT OF COUNTERPARTY CASH PAYMENTS;  \u2022  A REDUCTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF INTRADAY CREDIT LINES AT OUR CLEARING AGENTS AND AGENT BANKS; AND  \u2022  HIGHER SETTLEMENT VOLUMES DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ACTIVITY.  LONG-TERM STRESS TESTING.  WE UTILIZE LONGER-TERM STRESS TESTS TO TAKE A FORWARD VIEW ON OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION THROUGH PROLONGED STRESS PERIODS IN WHICH WE EXPERIENCE A SEVERE LIQUIDITY STRESS AND RECOVER IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT CONTINUES TO BE CHALLENGING. WE ARE FOCUSED ON ENSURING CONSERVATIVE ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT TO PREPARE FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF POTENTIAL STRESS, SEEKING TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSIFIED FUNDING PROFILE WITH AN APPROPRIATE TENOR, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CHARACTERISTICS AND LIQUIDITY PROFILE OF OUR ASSETS.  WE ALSO PERFORM STRESS TESTS ON A REGULAR BASIS AS PART OF OUR ROUTINE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND CONDUCT TAILORED STRESS TESTS ON AN AD HOC OR PRODUCT-SPECIFIC BASIS IN RESPONSE TO MARKET DEVELOPMENTS.  RESOLUTION LIQUIDITY MODELS.  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR RESOLUTION PLANNING EFFORTS, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED OUR RESOLUTION LIQUIDITY ADEQUACY AND POSITIONING FRAMEWORK, WHICH ESTIMATES LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF OUR MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. THE LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARE MEASURED USING OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW ASSUMPTIONS AND INCLUDE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL INTER-AFFILIATE EXPOSURES. WE HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED OUR RESOLUTION LIQUIDITY EXECUTION NEED FRAMEWORK, WHICH MEASURES THE LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF OUR MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES TO STABILIZE AND WIND-DOWN FOLLOWING A GROUP INC. BANKRUPTCY FILING IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR PREFERRED RESOLUTION STRATEGY.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A TRIGGERS AND ALERTS FRAMEWORK, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE BOARD WITH INFORMATION NEEDED TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON WHETHER AND WHEN TO COMMENCE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS FOR GROUP INC.  MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION  WE REGULARLY REFINE OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW, INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL AND OUR OTHER STRESS TESTING MODELS TO REFLECT CHANGES IN MARKET OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OUR BUSINESS MIX. ANY CHANGES, INCLUDING MODEL ASSUMPTIONS, ARE APPROVED BY TREASURY AND LIQUIDITY RISK. ALL EXISTING MODELS ARE REVIEWED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO MODELS AND THEIR ASSUMPTIONS ARE APPROVED BY MODEL RISK PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION. SEE \u201cMODEL RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  LIMITS  WE USE LIQUIDITY RISK LIMITS AT VARIOUS LEVELS AND ACROSS LIQUIDITY RISK TYPES TO MANAGE THE SIZE OF OUR LIQUIDITY EXPOSURES. LIMITS ARE MEASURED RELATIVE TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF RISK GIVEN OUR LIQUIDITY RISK TOLERANCE. SEE \u201cOVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE LIMIT APPROVAL PROCESS.  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  126  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  LIMITS ARE MONITORED BY TREASURY AND LIQUIDITY RISK. LIQUIDITY RISK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING AND ESCALATING TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND/OR THE APPROPRIATE RISK COMMITTEE, ON A TIMELY BASIS, INSTANCES WHERE LIMITS HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED.  GCLA AND UNENCUMBERED METRICS  GCLA.  BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR INTERNAL LIQUIDITY RISK MODELS, DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS WELL AS OUR CONSIDERATION OF OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF OUR CONDITION, AS WELL AS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, WE BELIEVE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AS OF BOTH SEPTEMBER 2019 AND DECEMBER 2018 WAS APPROPRIATE. WE STRICTLY LIMIT OUR GCLA TO A NARROWLY DEFINED LIST OF SECURITIES AND CASH BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLY LIQUID, EVEN IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT. WE DO NOT INCLUDE OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN OUR GCLA, SUCH AS LESS LIQUID UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES OR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES.  THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS INFORMATION ABOUT OUR GCLA.

WE MAINTAIN OUR GCLA TO ENABLE US TO MEET CURRENT AND POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF OUR PARENT COMPANY, GROUP INC., AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW AND INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL INCORPORATE A CONSOLIDATED REQUIREMENT FOR GROUP INC., AS WELL AS A STANDALONE REQUIREMENT FOR EACH OF OUR MAJOR BROKER-DEALER AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES. FUNDING IHC IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY LIQUIDITY TO GROUP INC. DURING THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, AND IS ALSO OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY SUPPORT TO MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES IN THE EVENT OF OUR MATERIAL FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR FAILURE. LIQUIDITY HELD DIRECTLY IN EACH OF OUR MAJOR BROKER-DEALER AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES IS INTENDED FOR USE ONLY BY THAT SUBSIDIARY TO MEET ITS LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND IS ASSUMED NOT TO BE AVAILABLE TO GROUP INC. OR FUNDING IHC UNLESS (I) LEGALLY PROVIDED FOR AND (II) THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY, TAX OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW AND INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL ALSO INCORPORATE A BROADER ASSESSMENT OF STANDALONE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND WE HOLD A PORTION OF OUR GCLA DIRECTLY AT GROUP INC. OR FUNDING IHC TO SUPPORT SUCH REQUIREMENTS.  OTHER UNENCUMBERED ASSETS.  IN ADDITION TO OUR GCLA, WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OTHER UNENCUMBERED CASH AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING OTHER GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, HIGH-GRADE MONEY MARKET SECURITIES, CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS, MARGINABLE EQUITIES, LOANS AND CASH DEPOSITS NOT INCLUDED IN OUR GCLA. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR UNENCUMBERED ASSETS AVERAGED $203.30 BILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019 AND $204.19 BILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2019. WE DO NOT CONSIDER THESE ASSETS LIQUID ENOUGH TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR GCLA.  LIQUIDITY REGULATORY FRAMEWORK  AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY (BHC), WE ARE SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR) UNDER THE LCR RULE APPROVED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES. THE LCR RULE REQUIRES ORGANIZATIONS TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE RATIO OF ELIGIBLE HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS (HQLA) TO EXPECTED NET CASH OUTFLOWS UNDER AN ACUTE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY STRESS SCENARIO. ELIGIBLE HQLA EXCLUDES HQLA HELD BY SUBSIDIARIES THAT IS IN EXCESS OF THEIR MINIMUM REQUIREMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS. WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM LCR OF 100%. WE EXPECT THAT FLUCTUATIONS IN CLIENT ACTIVITY, BUSINESS MIX AND THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT WILL IMPACT OUR AVERAGE LCR.  127  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

THE PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TO ENSURE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO STABLE FUNDING OVER A  ONE-YEAR  TIME HORIZON. THE PROPOSED RULE INCLUDES QUARTERLY DISCLOSURE OF THE RATIO AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION\u2019S STABLE FUNDING SOURCES. THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE NOT RELEASED THE FINAL RULE. WE EXPECT THAT WE WILL BE COMPLIANT WITH THE NSFR REQUIREMENT WHEN IT IS EFFECTIVE.  THE FOLLOWING IS INFORMATION ABOUT OUR SUBSIDIARY LIQUIDITY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.  \u2022  GS BANK USA.  GS BANK USA IS SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM LCR OF 100% UNDER THE LCR RULE APPROVED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, GS BANK USA\u2019S LCR EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT. THE NSFR REQUIREMENT DESCRIBED ABOVE WOULD ALSO APPLY TO GS BANK USA.  \u2022  GSI.  GSI IS SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM LCR OF 100% UNDER THE LCR RULE APPROVED BY THE U.K. REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. GSI\u2019S AVERAGE MONTHLY LCR FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019 EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT.  \u2022  OTHER SUBSIDIARIES.  WE MONITOR LOCAL REGULATORY LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. FOR MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, THESE REQUIREMENTS EITHER HAVE CHANGED OR ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION\u2019S FRAMEWORK FOR LIQUIDITY RISK MEASUREMENT, STANDARDS AND MONITORING, AS WELL AS OTHER REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS.  THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RULES AND ANY AMENDMENTS ADOPTED BY THE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, COULD IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE.  CREDIT RATINGS  WE RELY ON THE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS TO FUND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR  DAY-TO-DAY  OPERATIONS AND THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF DEBT FINANCING IS INFLUENCED BY OUR CREDIT RATINGS.

CERTAIN OF OUR DERIVATIVES HAVE BEEN TRANSACTED UNDER BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES WHO MAY REQUIRE US TO POST COLLATERAL OR TERMINATE THE TRANSACTIONS BASED ON CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS. WE MANAGE OUR GCLA TO ENSURE WE WOULD, AMONG OTHER POTENTIAL REQUIREMENTS, BE ABLE TO MAKE THE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED IN THE EVENT OF A  TWO-NOTCH  REDUCTION IN OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS, AS WELL AS COLLATERAL THAT HAS NOT BEEN CALLED BY COUNTERPARTIES, BUT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM.

CASH FLOWS  AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, OUR CASH FLOWS ARE COMPLEX AND BEAR LITTLE RELATION TO OUR NET EARNINGS AND NET ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, WE BELIEVE THAT TRADITIONAL CASH FLOW ANALYSIS IS LESS MEANINGFUL IN EVALUATING OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION THAN THE LIQUIDITY AND ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POLICIES DESCRIBED ABOVE. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS MAY, HOWEVER, BE HELPFUL IN HIGHLIGHTING CERTAIN MACRO TRENDS AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN OUR BUSINESSES.  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019.  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED BY $36.45 BILLION TO $94.09 BILLION AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET CASH USED FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES. THE NET CASH USED FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS INCLUDED IN COLLATERALIZED TRANSACTIONS. THESE CHANGES PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER CLIENT ACTIVITY. THE NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS  AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE  SECURITIES. THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED INCREASES IN CONSUMER DEPOSITS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET REPAYMENTS OF UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2018.  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED BY $8.82 BILLION TO $118.87 BILLION AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES. THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED INCREASES IN BROKERED CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND MARCUS DEPOSITS, AND NET ISSUANCES OF UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS. THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED A DECREASE IN COLLATERALIZED TRANSACTIONS AND AN INCREASE IN PAYABLES TO CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED. THE NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY TO FUND LOANS RECEIVABLE TO CORPORATE BORROWERS AND LOANS BACKED BY COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE.  129  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  OVERVIEW  MARKET RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS IN THE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, DUE TO CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS. WE EMPLOY A VARIETY OF RISK MEASURES, EACH DESCRIBED IN THE RESPECTIVE SECTIONS BELOW, TO MONITOR MARKET RISK. WE HOLD INVENTORY PRIMARILY FOR MARKET MAKING FOR OUR CLIENTS AND FOR OUR INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. OUR INVENTORY, THEREFORE, CHANGES BASED ON CLIENT DEMANDS AND OUR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. OUR INVENTORY IS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND THEREFORE FLUCTUATES ON A DAILY BASIS, WITH THE RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN MARKET MAKING AND OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS. CATEGORIES OF MARKET RISK INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  INTEREST RATE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN THE LEVEL, SLOPE AND CURVATURE OF YIELD CURVES, THE VOLATILITIES OF INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND CREDIT SPREADS;  \u2022  EQUITY PRICE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL EQUITIES, BASKETS OF EQUITIES AND EQUITY INDICES;  \u2022  CURRENCY RATE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF CURRENCY RATES; AND  \u2022  COMMODITY PRICE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF COMMODITIES, SUCH AS CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, ELECTRICITY, AND PRECIOUS AND BASE METALS.  MARKET RISK, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF RISK OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING OUR MARKET RISK THROUGH FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT ACROSS OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES.  MANAGERS IN REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND MARKET RISK DISCUSS MARKET INFORMATION, POSITIONS AND ESTIMATED LOSS SCENARIOS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. MANAGERS IN REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANAGING RISK WITHIN PRESCRIBED LIMITS. THESE MANAGERS HAVE  IN-DEPTH  KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR POSITIONS, MARKETS AND THE INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE TO HEDGE THEIR EXPOSURES.  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS  OUR PROCESS FOR MANAGING MARKET RISK INCLUDES.  \u2022  COLLECTING COMPLETE, ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION;  \u2022  UTILIZING A DYNAMIC LIMIT-SETTING FRAMEWORK;  \u2022  MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH ESTABLISHED MARKET RISK LIMITS AND REPORTING OUR EXPOSURES;  \u2022  DIVERSIFYING EXPOSURES;  \u2022  CONTROLLING POSITION SIZES;  \u2022  EVALUATING MITIGANTS, SUCH AS ECONOMIC HEDGES IN RELATED SECURITIES OR DERIVATIVES; AND  \u2022  ENSURING PROACTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS.  OUR MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ENABLE US TO PERFORM AN INDEPENDENT CALCULATION OF VAR AND STRESS MEASURES, CAPTURE RISK MEASURES AT INDIVIDUAL POSITION LEVELS, ATTRIBUTE RISK MEASURES TO INDIVIDUAL RISK FACTORS OF EACH POSITION, REPORT MANY DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE RISK MEASURES (E.G., BY DESK, BUSINESS, PRODUCT TYPE OR ENTITY) AND PRODUCE AD HOC ANALYSES IN A TIMELY MANNER.  RISK MEASURES  WE PRODUCE RISK MEASURES AND MONITOR THEM AGAINST ESTABLISHED MARKET RISK LIMITS. THESE MEASURES REFLECT AN EXTENSIVE RANGE OF SCENARIOS AND THE RESULTS ARE AGGREGATED AT PRODUCT, BUSINESS AND FIRMWIDE LEVELS.  WE USE A VARIETY OF RISK MEASURES TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF POTENTIAL LOSSES FOR BOTH MODERATE AND MORE EXTREME MARKET MOVES OVER BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM TIME HORIZONS. OUR PRIMARY RISK MEASURES ARE VAR, WHICH IS USED FOR SHORTER-TERM PERIODS, AND STRESS TESTS. OUR RISK REPORTS DETAIL KEY RISKS, DRIVERS AND CHANGES FOR EACH DESK AND BUSINESS, AND ARE DISTRIBUTED DAILY TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF BOTH OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS.  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  130  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  VALUE-AT-RISK.  VAR IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON WITH A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL. FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN VAR, SEE \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENT LINKAGES TO MARKET RISK MEASURES.\u201d WE TYPICALLY EMPLOY A  ONE-DAY  TIME HORIZON WITH A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. WE USE A SINGLE VAR MODEL, WHICH CAPTURES RISKS INCLUDING INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS SUCH, VAR FACILITATES COMPARISON ACROSS PORTFOLIOS OF DIFFERENT RISK CHARACTERISTICS. VAR ALSO CAPTURES THE DIVERSIFICATION OF AGGREGATED RISK AT THE FIRMWIDE LEVEL.  WE ARE AWARE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO VAR AND THEREFORE USE A VARIETY OF RISK MEASURES IN OUR MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO VAR INCLUDE.  \u2022  VAR DOES NOT ESTIMATE POTENTIAL LOSSES OVER LONGER TIME HORIZONS WHERE MOVES MAY BE EXTREME;  \u2022  VAR DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE RELATIVE LIQUIDITY OF DIFFERENT RISK POSITIONS; AND  \u2022  PREVIOUS MOVES IN MARKET RISK FACTORS MAY NOT PRODUCE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF ALL FUTURE MARKET MOVES.  TO COMPREHENSIVELY CAPTURE OUR EXPOSURES AND RELEVANT RISKS IN OUR VAR CALCULATION, WE USE HISTORICAL SIMULATIONS WITH FULL VALUATION OF MARKET FACTORS AT THE POSITION LEVEL BY SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOCKING THE RELEVANT MARKET FACTORS FOR THAT POSITION. THESE MARKET FACTORS INCLUDE SPOT PRICES, CREDIT SPREADS, FUNDING SPREADS, YIELD CURVES, VOLATILITY AND CORRELATION, AND ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY BASED ON CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF POSITIONS, AS WELL AS VARIATIONS IN MARKET CONDITIONS. WE SAMPLE FROM FIVE YEARS OF HISTORICAL DATA TO GENERATE THE SCENARIOS FOR OUR VAR CALCULATION. THE HISTORICAL DATA IS WEIGHTED SO THAT THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE DATA REDUCES OVER TIME. THIS GIVES GREATER IMPORTANCE TO MORE RECENT OBSERVATIONS AND REFLECTS CURRENT ASSET VOLATILITIES, WHICH IMPROVES THE ACCURACY OF OUR ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL LOSS. AS A RESULT, EVEN IF OUR POSITIONS INCLUDED IN VAR WERE UNCHANGED, OUR VAR WOULD INCREASE WITH INCREASING MARKET VOLATILITY AND VICE VERSA.  GIVEN ITS RELIANCE ON HISTORICAL DATA, VAR IS MOST EFFECTIVE IN ESTIMATING RISK EXPOSURES IN MARKETS IN WHICH THERE ARE NO SUDDEN FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES OR SHIFTS IN MARKET CONDITIONS.  OUR VAR MEASURE DOES NOT INCLUDE.  \u2022  POSITIONS THAT ARE BEST MEASURED AND MONITORED USING SENSITIVITY MEASURES; AND  \u2022  THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN COUNTERPARTY AND OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON DERIVATIVES, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON FINANCIAL LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED.  WE PERFORM DAILY BACKTESTING OF OUR VAR MODEL (I.E., COMPARING DAILY NET REVENUES FOR POSITIONS INCLUDED IN VAR TO THE VAR MEASURE CALCULATED AS OF THE PRIOR BUSINESS DAY) AT THE FIRMWIDE LEVEL AND FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES AND MAJOR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.  STRESS TESTING.  STRESS TESTING IS A METHOD OF DETERMINING THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS HYPOTHETICAL STRESS SCENARIOS. WE USE STRESS TESTING TO EXAMINE RISKS OF SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF OUR SIGNIFICANT RISK EXPOSURES. WE USE A VARIETY OF STRESS TESTING TECHNIQUES TO CALCULATE THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM A WIDE RANGE OF MARKET MOVES ON OUR PORTFOLIOS, INCLUDING FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND SCENARIO ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS OF OUR VARIOUS STRESS TESTS ARE ANALYZED TOGETHER FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. SEE \u201cOVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR INFORMATION ABOUT FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS.  SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS USED TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF A MARKET MOVE IN A SINGLE RISK FACTOR ACROSS ALL POSITIONS (E.G., EQUITY PRICES OR CREDIT SPREADS) USING A VARIETY OF DEFINED MARKET SHOCKS, RANGING FROM THOSE THAT COULD BE EXPECTED OVER A  ONE-DAY  TIME HORIZON UP TO THOSE THAT COULD TAKE MANY MONTHS TO OCCUR. WE ALSO USE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF THE DEFAULT OF ANY SINGLE ENTITY, WHICH CAPTURES THE RISK OF LARGE OR CONCENTRATED EXPOSURES.  SCENARIO ANALYSIS IS USED TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF A SPECIFIED EVENT, INCLUDING HOW THE EVENT IMPACTS MULTIPLE RISK FACTORS SIMULTANEOUSLY. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR SOVEREIGN STRESS TESTING WE CALCULATE POTENTIAL DIRECT EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SOVEREIGN INVENTORY, AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING DEBT, EQUITY AND CURRENCY EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR  NON-SOVEREIGN  INVENTORY THAT MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE SOVEREIGN DISTRESS. WHEN CONDUCTING SCENARIO ANALYSIS, WE TYPICALLY CONSIDER A NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES FOR EACH SCENARIO, RANGING FROM MODERATE TO SEVERELY ADVERSE MARKET IMPACTS. IN ADDITION, THESE STRESS TESTS ARE CONSTRUCTED USING BOTH HISTORICAL EVENTS AND FORWARD-LOOKING HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS.  UNLIKE VAR MEASURES, WHICH HAVE AN IMPLIED PROBABILITY BECAUSE THEY ARE CALCULATED AT A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL, THERE IS GENERALLY NO IMPLIED PROBABILITY THAT OUR STRESS TESTING SCENARIOS WILL OCCUR. INSTEAD, STRESS TESTING IS USED TO MODEL BOTH MODERATE AND MORE EXTREME MOVES IN UNDERLYING MARKET FACTORS. WHEN ESTIMATING POTENTIAL LOSS, WE GENERALLY ASSUME THAT OUR POSITIONS CANNOT BE REDUCED OR HEDGED (ALTHOUGH EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT WE ARE GENERALLY ABLE TO DO SO).  131  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  LIMITS  WE USE MARKET RISK LIMITS AT VARIOUS LEVELS TO MANAGE THE SIZE OF OUR MARKET EXPOSURES. THESE LIMITS ARE SET BASED ON VAR AND ON A RANGE OF STRESS TESTS RELEVANT TO OUR EXPOSURES. SEE \u201cOVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE LIMIT APPROVAL PROCESS.  MARKET RISK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THESE LIMITS, AND IDENTIFYING AND ESCALATING TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND/OR THE APPROPRIATE RISK COMMITTEE, ON A TIMELY BASIS, INSTANCES WHERE LIMITS HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED (E.G., DUE TO POSITIONAL CHANGES OR CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH AS INCREASED VOLATILITIES OR CHANGES IN CORRELATIONS). SUCH INSTANCES ARE REMEDIATED BY AN INVENTORY REDUCTION AND/OR A TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT INCREASE TO THE LIMIT.  MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION  OUR VAR AND STRESS TESTING MODELS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED AND ENHANCED IN ORDER TO INCORPORATE CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF POSITIONS INCLUDED IN OUR MARKET RISK MEASURES, AS WELL AS VARIATIONS IN MARKET CONDITIONS. ALL EXISTING MODELS ARE REVIEWED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO MODELS AND THEIR ASSUMPTIONS ARE APPROVED BY MODEL RISK PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION. SEE \u201cMODEL RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  METRICS  WE ANALYZE VAR AT THE FIRMWIDE LEVEL AND A VARIETY OF MORE DETAILED LEVELS, INCLUDING BY RISK CATEGORY, BUSINESS AND REGION.

NET LOSSES INCURRED ON A SINGLE DAY FOR SUCH POSITIONS DID NOT EXCEED OUR 95%  ONE-DAY  VAR (I.E., A VAR EXCEPTION) DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019.  DURING PERIODS IN WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POSITIVE NET REVENUE DAYS THAN NET REVENUE LOSS DAYS, WE EXPECT TO HAVE FEWER VAR EXCEPTIONS BECAUSE, UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS, OUR BUSINESS MODEL GENERALLY PRODUCES POSITIVE NET REVENUES. IN PERIODS IN WHICH OUR FRANCHISE REVENUES ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, WE GENERALLY HAVE MORE LOSS DAYS, RESULTING IN MORE VAR EXCEPTIONS. THE DAILY NET REVENUES FOR POSITIONS INCLUDED IN VAR USED TO DETERMINE VAR EXCEPTIONS REFLECT THE IMPACT OF ANY INTRADAY ACTIVITY, INCLUDING BID/OFFER NET REVENUES, WHICH ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE POSITIVE BY THEIR NATURE.  SENSITIVITY MEASURES  CERTAIN PORTFOLIOS AND INDIVIDUAL POSITIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN VAR BECAUSE VAR IS NOT THE MOST APPROPRIATE RISK MEASURE.

OUR EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK COMES MOSTLY FROM CLIENT TRANSACTIONS IN OTC DERIVATIVES AND LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS. CREDIT RISK ALSO COMES FROM CASH PLACED WITH BANKS, SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS (I.E., RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES) AND CUSTOMER AND OTHER RECEIVABLES.  CREDIT RISK, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF RISK OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING OUR CREDIT RISK THROUGH FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT ACROSS OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES. THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE REVIEWS AND APPROVES CREDIT POLICIES AND PARAMETERS. IN ADDITION, WE HOLD OTHER POSITIONS THAT GIVE RISE TO CREDIT RISK (E.G., BONDS HELD IN OUR INVENTORY AND SECONDARY BANK LOANS). THESE CREDIT RISKS ARE CAPTURED AS A COMPONENT OF MARKET RISK MEASURES, WHICH ARE MONITORED AND MANAGED BY MARKET RISK, CONSISTENT WITH OTHER INVENTORY POSITIONS. WE ALSO ENTER INTO DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE MARKET RISK EXPOSURES. SUCH DERIVATIVES ALSO GIVE RISE TO CREDIT RISK, WHICH IS MONITORED AND MANAGED BY CREDIT RISK.  CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS  OUR PROCESS FOR MANAGING CREDIT RISK INCLUDES.  \u2022  COLLECTING COMPLETE, ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION;  \u2022  APPROVING TRANSACTIONS AND SETTING AND COMMUNICATING CREDIT EXPOSURE LIMITS;  \u2022  MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH ESTABLISHED CREDIT RISK LIMITS AND REPORTING OUR EXPOSURE;  \u2022  ESTABLISHING OR APPROVING UNDERWRITING STANDARDS;  \u2022  ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A COUNTERPARTY WILL DEFAULT ON ITS PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS;  \u2022  MEASURING OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM A COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT;  \u2022  USING CREDIT RISK MITIGANTS, INCLUDING COLLATERAL AND HEDGING;  \u2022  MAXIMIZING RECOVERY THROUGH ACTIVE WORKOUT AND RESTRUCTURING OF CLAIMS; AND  \u2022  ENSURING PROACTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS.  AS PART OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS, WE PERFORM CREDIT REVIEWS, WHICH INCLUDE INITIAL AND ONGOING ANALYSES OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES. FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES, THE CORE OF OUR PROCESS IS AN ANNUAL COUNTERPARTY CREDIT REVIEW. A CREDIT REVIEW IS AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF THE CAPACITY AND WILLINGNESS OF A COUNTERPARTY TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS, RESULTING IN AN INTERNAL CREDIT RATING. THE DETERMINATION OF INTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS ALSO INCORPORATES ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE NATURE OF AND OUTLOOK FOR THE COUNTERPARTY\u2019S INDUSTRY, AND THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. SENIOR PERSONNEL, WITH EXPERTISE IN SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, INSPECT AND APPROVE CREDIT REVIEWS AND INTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS.  135  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OUR RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS MAY ALSO INCLUDE, WHERE APPLICABLE, REVIEWING CERTAIN KEY METRICS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DELINQUENCY STATUS, COLLATERAL VALUES, FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION CREDIT SCORES AND OTHER RISK FACTORS.  OUR GLOBAL CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS CAPTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES AND ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS TO COUNTERPARTIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES. THESE SYSTEMS ALSO PROVIDE MANAGEMENT WITH COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR AGGREGATE CREDIT RISK BY PRODUCT, INTERNAL CREDIT RATING, INDUSTRY, COUNTRY AND REGION.  RISK MEASURES AND LIMITS  WE MEASURE OUR CREDIT RISK BASED ON THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN THE EVENT OF  NON-PAYMENT  BY A COUNTERPARTY USING CURRENT AND POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. FOR DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, CURRENT EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT PRESENTLY OWED TO US AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT APPLICABLE NETTING AND COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS, WHILE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE REPRESENTS OUR ESTIMATE OF THE FUTURE EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE OVER THE LIFE OF A TRANSACTION BASED ON MARKET MOVEMENTS WITHIN A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL. POTENTIAL EXPOSURE ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT NETTING AND COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS. FOR LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS, THE PRIMARY MEASURE IS A FUNCTION OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE POSITION.  WE USE CREDIT RISK LIMITS AT VARIOUS LEVELS, AS WELL AS UNDERWRITING STANDARDS TO MANAGE THE SIZE AND NATURE OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES. LIMITS FOR INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES ARE BASED ON OUR RISK APPETITE AND ARE DESIGNED TO ALLOW FOR REGULAR MONITORING, REVIEW, ESCALATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS. SEE \u201cOVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE LIMIT APPROVAL PROCESS.  POLICIES AUTHORIZED BY THE FIRMWIDE ENTERPRISE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE PRESCRIBE THE LEVEL OF FORMAL APPROVAL REQUIRED FOR US TO ASSUME CREDIT EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY ACROSS ALL PRODUCT AREAS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY APPLICABLE NETTING PROVISIONS, COLLATERAL OR OTHER CREDIT RISK MITIGANTS.  CREDIT RISK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THESE LIMITS, AND IDENTIFYING AND ESCALATING TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND/OR THE APPROPRIATE RISK COMMITTEE, ON A TIMELY BASIS, INSTANCES WHERE LIMITS HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED.  STRESS TESTS  WE USE REGULAR STRESS TESTS TO CALCULATE THE CREDIT EXPOSURES, INCLUDING POTENTIAL CONCENTRATIONS THAT WOULD RESULT FROM APPLYING SHOCKS TO COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RATINGS OR CREDIT RISK FACTORS (E.G., CURRENCY RATES, INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES). THESE SHOCKS INCLUDE A WIDE RANGE OF MODERATE AND MORE EXTREME MARKET MOVEMENTS. SOME OF OUR STRESS TESTS INCLUDE SHOCKS TO MULTIPLE RISK FACTORS, CONSISTENT WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF A SEVERE MARKET OR ECONOMIC EVENT. IN THE CASE OF SOVEREIGN DEFAULT, WE ESTIMATE THE DIRECT IMPACT OF THE DEFAULT ON OUR SOVEREIGN CREDIT EXPOSURES, CHANGES TO OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ARISING FROM POTENTIAL MARKET MOVES IN RESPONSE TO THE DEFAULT, AND THE IMPACT OF CREDIT MARKET DETERIORATION ON CORPORATE BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SOVEREIGN DEFAULT. UNLIKE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE, WHICH IS CALCULATED WITHIN A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL, WITH A STRESS TEST THERE IS GENERALLY NO ASSUMED PROBABILITY OF THESE EVENTS OCCURRING. WE ALSO PERFORM FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS. SEE \u201cOVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR INFORMATION ABOUT FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS.  MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION  OUR POTENTIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE AND STRESS TESTING MODELS, AND ANY CHANGES TO SUCH MODELS OR ASSUMPTIONS, ARE INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED, VALIDATED AND APPROVED BY MODEL RISK. SEE \u201cMODEL RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  RISK MITIGANTS  TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ON DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, WE MAY ENTER INTO NETTING AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT PERMIT US TO OFFSET RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTIES. WE MAY ALSO REDUCE CREDIT RISK WITH COUNTERPARTIES BY ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS THAT ENABLE US TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL FROM THEM ON AN UPFRONT OR CONTINGENT BASIS AND/OR TO TERMINATE TRANSACTIONS IF THE COUNTERPARTY\u2019S CREDIT RATING FALLS BELOW A SPECIFIED LEVEL. WE MONITOR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL TO ENSURE THAT OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ARE APPROPRIATELY COLLATERALIZED. WE SEEK TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURES WHERE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES AND THE MARKET VALUE OF COLLATERAL WE RECEIVE.

AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FOR LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS, DEPENDING ON THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE BORROWER AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRANSACTION, WE EMPLOY A VARIETY OF POTENTIAL RISK MITIGANTS. RISK MITIGANTS INCLUDE COLLATERAL PROVISIONS, GUARANTEES, COVENANTS, STRUCTURAL SENIORITY OF THE BANK LOAN CLAIMS AND, FOR CERTAIN LENDING COMMITMENTS, PROVISIONS IN THE LEGAL DOCUMENTATION THAT ALLOW US TO ADJUST LOAN AMOUNTS, PRICING, STRUCTURE AND OTHER TERMS AS MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE. THE TYPE AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MITIGANTS EMPLOYED CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE DEGREE OF CREDIT RISK INVOLVED IN A LOAN OR LENDING COMMITMENT.  WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT VISIBILITY INTO A COUNTERPARTY\u2019S FINANCIAL STRENGTH OR WHEN WE BELIEVE A COUNTERPARTY REQUIRES SUPPORT FROM ITS PARENT, WE MAY OBTAIN THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES OF THE COUNTERPARTY\u2019S OBLIGATIONS. WE MAY ALSO MITIGATE OUR CREDIT RISK USING CREDIT DERIVATIVES OR PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS.  CREDIT EXPOSURES  AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, OUR AGGREGATE CREDIT EXPOSURE DECREASED AS COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 2018, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A DECREASE IN CASH DEPOSITS WITH CENTRAL BANKS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ARISING FROM  NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE  COUNTERPARTIES (BASED ON OUR INTERNALLY DETERMINED PUBLIC RATING AGENCY EQUIVALENTS) INCREASED AS COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 2018, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A DECREASE IN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATED TO CASH DEPOSITS WITH CENTRAL BANKS. OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTIES THAT DEFAULTED DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019 WAS HIGHER AS COMPARED WITH OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTIES THAT DEFAULTED DURING THE SAME PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF SUCH EXPOSURE WAS RELATED TO LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS. OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTIES THAT DEFAULTED DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019 REMAINED LOW, REPRESENTING LESS THAN 0.5% OF OUR TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE. ESTIMATED LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEFAULTS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ARE DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE ON CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARISES FROM OUR UNRESTRICTED CASH, AND INCLUDES BOTH INTEREST-BEARING AND  NON-INTEREST-BEARING  DEPOSITS.

AS A MARKET MAKER, WE ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO CLIENTS AND TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER AND HEDGING OF THEIR RISKS. WE ALSO ENTER INTO DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE MARKET RISK EXPOSURES. WE MANAGE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE ON OTC DERIVATIVES USING THE CREDIT RISK PROCESS, MEASURES, LIMITS AND RISK MITIGANTS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  WE GENERALLY ENTER INTO OTC DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS UNDER BILATERAL COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT REQUIRE THE DAILY EXCHANGE OF COLLATERAL. AS CREDIT RISK IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF FAIR VALUE, WE INCLUDE A CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA) IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. CVA IS A FUNCTION OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED EXPOSURE, THE PROBABILITY OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT AND THE ASSUMED RECOVERY UPON DEFAULT.  137  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

WE ALSO UTILIZE THESE STRESS TESTS TO ESTIMATE THE INDIRECT IMPACT OF CERTAIN HYPOTHETICAL EVENTS ON OUR COUNTRY EXPOSURES, SUCH AS THE IMPACT OF CREDIT MARKET DETERIORATION ON CORPORATE BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES ALONG WITH THE SHOCKS TO THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE PARAMETERS OF THESE SHOCKS VARY BASED ON THE SCENARIO REFLECTED IN EACH STRESS TEST. WE REVIEW ESTIMATED LOSSES PRODUCED BY THE STRESS TESTS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THEIR MAGNITUDE, HIGHLIGHT POTENTIAL LOSS CONCENTRATIONS, AND ASSESS AND MITIGATE OUR EXPOSURES WHERE NECESSARY.  OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT  OVERVIEW  OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF AN ADVERSE OUTCOME RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE, SYSTEMS OR FROM EXTERNAL EVENTS. OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL RISK ARISES FROM ROUTINE PROCESSING ERRORS, AS WELL AS EXTRAORDINARY INCIDENTS, SUCH AS MAJOR SYSTEMS FAILURES OR LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS.  POTENTIAL TYPES OF LOSS EVENTS RELATED TO INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK INCLUDE.  \u2022  CLIENTS, PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS PRACTICES;  \u2022  EXECUTION, DELIVERY AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT;  \u2022  BUSINESS DISRUPTION AND SYSTEM FAILURES;  \u2022  EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND WORKPLACE SAFETY;  \u2022  DAMAGE TO PHYSICAL ASSETS;  \u2022  INTERNAL FRAUD; AND  \u2022  EXTERNAL FRAUD.  141  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  WE MAINTAIN A COMPREHENSIVE CONTROL FRAMEWORK DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A WELL-CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT TO MINIMIZE OPERATIONAL RISKS. THE FIRMWIDE CONDUCT AND OPERATIONAL RISK COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ONGOING APPROVAL AND MONITORING OF THE FRAMEWORKS, POLICIES, PARAMETERS, LIMITS AND THRESHOLDS WHICH GOVERN OUR OPERATIONAL RISKS.  OPERATIONAL RISK, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF RISK OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A FORMALIZED FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING OPERATIONAL RISK WITH THE GOAL OF MAINTAINING OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL RISK AT LEVELS THAT ARE WITHIN OUR RISK APPETITE.  OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS  OUR PROCESS FOR MANAGING OPERATIONAL RISK INCLUDES.  \u2022  COLLECTING COMPLETE, ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION;  \u2022  TRAINING, SUPERVISION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PEOPLE;  \u2022  ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING OUR KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS;  \u2022  INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS THAT MONITOR OPERATIONAL RISK, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE OCCURRENCE OF OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS; AND  \u2022  ENSURING PROACTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS.  WE COMBINE  TOP-DOWN  AND  BOTTOM-UP  APPROACHES TO MANAGE AND MEASURE OPERATIONAL RISK. FROM A  TOP-DOWN  PERSPECTIVE, OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT ASSESSES FIRMWIDE AND BUSINESS-LEVEL OPERATIONAL RISK PROFILES. FROM A  BOTTOM-UP  PERSPECTIVE, OUR FIRST AND SECOND LINES OF DEFENSE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR RISK IDENTIFICATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT ON A  DAY-TO-DAY  BASIS, INCLUDING ESCALATING OPERATIONAL RISKS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT.  OUR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS IN PART DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE OPERATIONAL RISK MEASUREMENT RULES UNDER THE CAPITAL FRAMEWORK AND HAS EVOLVED BASED ON THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESSES AND REGULATORY GUIDANCE.  OUR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING PRACTICES.  \u2022  RISK IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT;  \u2022  RISK MEASUREMENT; AND  \u2022  RISK MONITORING AND REPORTING.  RISK IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT  THE CORE OF OUR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS RISK IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT. WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS, INCLUDING FIRMWIDE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, FOR OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS.  WE HAVE ESTABLISHED POLICIES THAT REQUIRE ALL EMPLOYEES TO REPORT AND ESCALATE OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS. WHEN OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS ARE IDENTIFIED, OUR POLICIES REQUIRE THAT THE EVENTS BE DOCUMENTED AND ANALYZED TO DETERMINE WHETHER CHANGES ARE REQUIRED IN OUR SYSTEMS AND/OR PROCESSES TO FURTHER MITIGATE THE RISK OF FUTURE EVENTS.  WE USE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT APPLICATIONS TO CAPTURE AND ORGANIZE OPERATIONAL RISK EVENT DATA AND KEY METRICS. ONE OF OUR KEY RISK IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS IS AN OPERATIONAL RISK AND CONTROL SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS, WHICH IS PERFORMED BY OUR MANAGERS. THIS PROCESS CONSISTS OF THE IDENTIFICATION AND RATING OF OPERATIONAL RISKS, ON A FORWARD-LOOKING BASIS, AND THE RELATED CONTROLS. THE RESULTS FROM THIS PROCESS ARE ANALYZED TO EVALUATE OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURES AND IDENTIFY BUSINESSES, ACTIVITIES OR PRODUCTS WITH HEIGHTENED LEVELS OF OPERATIONAL RISK.  RISK MEASUREMENT  WE MEASURE OUR OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURE USING BOTH STATISTICAL MODELING AND SCENARIO ANALYSES, WHICH INVOLVE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK EVENT DATA AND INTERNAL CONTROL FACTORS FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES. OPERATIONAL RISK MEASUREMENT ALSO INCORPORATES AN ASSESSMENT OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO.  \u2022  EVALUATIONS OF THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES;  \u2022  THE DEGREE OF AUTOMATION IN OUR PROCESSES;  \u2022  NEW ACTIVITY INFORMATION;  \u2022  THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT; AND  \u2022  CHANGES IN THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING THE DIVERSITY AND SOPHISTICATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES.  THE RESULTS FROM THESE SCENARIO ANALYSES ARE USED TO MONITOR CHANGES IN OPERATIONAL RISK AND TO DETERMINE BUSINESS LINES THAT MAY HAVE HEIGHTENED EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL RISK. THESE ANALYSES ARE USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL TO HOLD. WE ALSO PERFORM FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS. SEE \u201cOVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR INFORMATION ABOUT FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS.  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  142  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  RISK MONITORING AND REPORTING  WE EVALUATE CHANGES IN OUR OPERATIONAL RISK PROFILE AND OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN BUSINESS MIX OR JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, BY MONITORING THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE AT A FIRMWIDE LEVEL. WE HAVE BOTH PREVENTIVE AND DETECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF OPERATIONAL RISK LOSSES AND THE PROBABILITY OF OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS. WE MONITOR THE RESULTS OF ASSESSMENTS AND INDEPENDENT INTERNAL AUDITS OF THESE INTERNAL CONTROLS.  WE HAVE ESTABLISHED OPERATIONAL RISK LIMITS AND THRESHOLDS CONSISTENT WITH OUR RISK APPETITE STATEMENT, AS WELL AS ESCALATION PROTOCOLS. OPERATIONAL RISK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THESE LIMITS AND THRESHOLDS, AND IDENTIFYING AND ESCALATING TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND/OR THE APPROPRIATE RISK COMMITTEE, ON A TIMELY BASIS, INSTANCES WHERE LIMITS AND THRESHOLDS HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED. SEE \u201cOVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE LIMIT AND THRESHOLD APPROVAL PROCESS.  MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION  THE STATISTICAL MODELS USED TO MEASURE OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURE ARE INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED, VALIDATED AND APPROVED BY MODEL RISK. SEE \u201cMODEL RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT  OVERVIEW  MODEL RISK IS THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FROM DECISIONS MADE BASED ON MODEL OUTPUTS THAT MAY BE INCORRECT OR USED INAPPROPRIATELY. WE RELY ON QUANTITATIVE MODELS ACROSS OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY TO VALUE CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, TO MONITOR AND MANAGE OUR RISK, AND TO MEASURE AND MONITOR OUR REGULATORY CAPITAL.  OUR MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS MANAGED THROUGH A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, WHICH ENCOMPASS STANDARDS DESIGNED TO ENSURE WE MAINTAIN A COMPREHENSIVE MODEL INVENTORY, INCLUDING RISK ASSESSMENT AND CLASSIFICATION, SOUND MODEL DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES, INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND MODEL-SPECIFIC USAGE CONTROLS. THE FIRMWIDE MODEL RISK CONTROL COMMITTEE OVERSEES OUR MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK.  MODEL RISK, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, MODEL DEVELOPERS, MODEL OWNERS AND MODEL USERS, AND REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF RISK OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING OUR MODEL RISK THROUGH FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT ACROSS OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES, AND PROVIDES PERIODIC UPDATES TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, RISK COMMITTEES AND THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD.  MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION PROCESS  MODEL RISK CONSISTS OF QUANTITATIVE PROFESSIONALS WHO PERFORM AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW, VALIDATION AND APPROVAL OF OUR MODELS. THIS REVIEW INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF THE MODEL DOCUMENTATION, INDEPENDENT TESTING, AN ASSESSMENT OF THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE METHODOLOGY USED, AND VERIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE WITH MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS. ALL EXISTING MODELS ARE REVIEWED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, AND NEW MODELS OR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO MODELS ARE APPROVED PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION.  THE MODEL VALIDATION PROCESS INCORPORATES A REVIEW OF MODELS AND TRADE AND RISK PARAMETERS ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF SCENARIOS (INCLUDING EXTREME CONDITIONS) IN ORDER TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE AND VERIFY.  \u2022  THE MODEL\u2019S CONCEPTUAL SOUNDNESS, INCLUDING THE REASONABLENESS OF MODEL ASSUMPTIONS, AND SUITABILITY FOR INTENDED USE;  \u2022  THE TESTING STRATEGY UTILIZED BY THE MODEL DEVELOPERS TO ENSURE THAT THE MODELS FUNCTION AS INTENDED;  \u2022  THE SUITABILITY OF THE CALCULATION TECHNIQUES INCORPORATED IN THE MODEL;  \u2022  THE MODEL\u2019S ACCURACY IN REFLECTING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RELATED PRODUCT AND ITS SIGNIFICANT RISKS;  \u2022  THE MODEL\u2019S CONSISTENCY WITH MODELS FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS; AND  \u2022  THE MODEL\u2019S SENSITIVITY TO INPUT PARAMETERS AND ASSUMPTIONS.

STATEMENTS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF COMPENSATION EXPENSE, INCLUDING AS A PERCENTAGE OF OPERATING EXPENSES, AS OUR PLATFORM BUSINESS INITIATIVES REACH SCALE ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS THAT THE COMPENSATION COSTS TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING PLATFORM INITIATIVES, MAY BE GREATER THAN CURRENTLY EXPECTED.  STATEMENTS ABOUT THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF CECL ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE ACTUAL IMPACT MAY DIFFER, POSSIBLY MATERIALLY, FROM THAT CURRENTLY EXPECTED DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FROM ACCOUNTING OR REGULATORY AGENCIES, MANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS, CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT OR THE SIZE AND TYPE OF LOAN PORTFOLIOS WE HOLD WHEN WE ADOPT CECL, OR CHANGES TO OUR CREDIT LOSS MODELS IN CONNECTION WITH VALIDATING DATA INPUTS AND DEVELOPING THE POLICIES, SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT CECL.  STATEMENTS ABOUT THE PROJECTED GROWTH OF OUR U.S. AND U.K. RETAIL DEPOSIT PLATFORMS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT ACTUAL GROWTH MAY DIFFER, POSSIBLY MATERIALLY, FROM THAT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND COMPETITION FROM OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS.  STATEMENTS ABOUT THE TIMING, COSTS AND BENEFITS OF BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, AND THE EFFECTS OF THOSE INITIATIVES ON CHANGES IN AND THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR EFFICIENCY RATIO, ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE ACTUAL TIMING, COSTS, BENEFITS AND EFFECTS MAY DIFFER, POSSIBLY MATERIALLY, FROM WHAT IS CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE THESE INITIATIVES.

PDA AND LFT OFFER A RANGE OF LEADERSHIP STAFFING AND PERMANENT PLACEMENT SOLUTIONS FOR THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. SEE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTE (2), \u201cACQUISITIONS.\u201d  RECENT TRENDS  DEMAND FOR OUR TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT PLACEMENT STAFFING SERVICES IS DRIVEN IN PART BY U.S. ECONOMIC AND LABOR TRENDS. THE U.S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS\u2019 SURVEY DATA REFLECTS NEAR RECORD LEVELS OF HEALTHCARE JOB OPENINGS AND QUITS. WE VIEW THIS DATA, ALONG WITH A NEARLY 20-YEAR-LOW UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND CONTINUED ECONOMIC GROWTH AS POSITIVE TRENDS FOR THE HEALTHCARE STAFFING INDUSTRY. THESE POSITIVE MACRO ECONOMIC AND LABOR TRENDS HAVE CREATED A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE LABOR MARKET FOR CLINICIANS AND OUR CLINICIAN SUPPLY, PARTICULARLY IN NURSING, HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH GROWTH IN CLIENT DEMAND.  THE CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY IS CREATING LARGER, MORE SOPHISTICATED AND COMPLEX HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT WE BELIEVE HAS ELEVATED THE NEED FOR STRATEGIC WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS CAPABLE OF PARTNERING TO SOLVE THEIR RECRUITING, STAFFING AND WORKFORCE OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS. GIVEN THE INCREASING NEED FOR PARTNERS CAPABLE OF OFFERING A COMPREHENSIVE WORKFORCE SOLUTION, WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF OUR WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS STRATEGY, PARTICULARLY WITH OUR MSPS. AS A RESULT OF OUR ONGOING FOCUS ON THESE STRATEGIC MSP RELATIONSHIPS, THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR STAFFING REVENUE DERIVED FROM OUR MSP CLIENTS CONTINUES TO INCREASE, AND WE BELIEVE THESE STRATEGIC, LONGER-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WILL CONTINUE TO COMPRISE A GREATER PROPORTION OF REVENUE IN OUR STAFFING BUSINESSES.  IN OUR NURSE AND ALLIED SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, OVERALL DEMAND IS STRONG AND AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS SEEN SINCE 2016. HOWEVER, PLACEMENT ACTIVITY HAS BEEN UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED BY FEWER CONTINGENT NURSE STAFFING NEEDS FROM A LARGE CLIENT. ADDITIONALLY, A TIGHT LABOR MARKET AND MODEST GROWTH IN BILL RATES IS ALSO IMPACTING OUR ABILITY TO SUFFICIENTLY RECRUIT THE NURSES TO MEET THE INCREASED DEMAND. OUR ALLIED STAFFING BUSINESS CONTINUES TO HAVE STRONG OVERALL DEMAND RESULTING IN STEADY ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH. HOWEVER, WE HAVE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR THERAPISTS FROM OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY CLIENTS THAT IS RESULTING FROM RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT CHANGES. THE ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL SUPPLY OF NURSE AND ALLIED HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS FROM THE ADVANCED ACQUISITION HAS HELPED US BETTER ADDRESS OUR CLIENT\u2019S STAFFING DEMANDS.  THE DEMAND ENVIRONMENT FOR LOCUM TENENS IS ALSO GENERALLY FAVORABLE, ALTHOUGH DEMAND FOR HOSPITALISTS AND EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIANS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS. OUR LOCUM TENENS BUSINESS HAS STABILIZED AFTER DISRUPTION RESULTING FROM PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY CHANGES MADE DURING 2018, AND RECRUITER PRODUCTIVITY CONTINUES TO IMPROVE.  IN OUR OTHER WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, BETTER DEMAND AND PLACEMENTS IN THE INTERIM LEADERSHIP AND PHYSICIAN PERMANENT PLACEMENT DIVISIONS AND GROWTH IN TECHNOLOGY WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS ARE DRIVING IMPROVED SEGMENT PERFORMANCE AND OUR PROFITABILITY ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. SINCE EXPERIENCING A DECLINE IN OUR REVENUE CYCLE SOLUTIONS REVENUE IN RECENT QUARTERS, REVENUE FOR THIS DIVISION HAS SEEN SIGNS OF STABILIZATION DUE IN PART TO GROWING OPPORTUNITIES TO SERVE OUR MSP CUSTOMERS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT OUR REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

WE BASE THESE ESTIMATES ON THE INFORMATION THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO US AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD VARY FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. IF THESE ESTIMATES DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS, OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, OTHER THAN THE ADOPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-02 DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1.

EXCLUDING THE ADDITIONAL REVENUE FROM ACQUISITIONS, REVENUE INCREASED  1%.

THE GROSS MARGIN FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  WAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY A HIGHER GROSS MARGIN IN OUR NURSE AND ALLIED SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, DRIVEN BY A HIGHER LABOR DISRUPTION MARGIN AND PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER TRAVELER HOUSING COSTS, AND HIGHER OTHER WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS GROSS MARGIN. THESE POSITIVE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER MARGIN IN OUR LOCUM TENENS SOLUTIONS SEGMENT AND AN UNFAVORABLE SEGMENT MIX SHIFT. GROSS MARGIN BY REPORTABLE SEGMENT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  WAS  27.9%  AND  27.4%  FOR NURSE AND ALLIED SOLUTIONS,  27.5%  AND  28.4%  FOR LOCUM TENENS SOLUTIONS, AND  54.3%  AND  52.4%  FOR OTHER WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS, RESPECTIVELY.

INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, AND OTHER.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, AND OTHER, WAS  $7.8 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $4.6 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . THE  INCREASE  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT OUTSTANDING BALANCE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WHICH RESULTED FROM BORROWINGS USED TO FINANCE THE SILVERSHEET AND ADVANCED ACQUISITIONS, AND A $1.4 MILLION GAIN RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

THE  26%  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  DIFFERS FROM OUR ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  24%  PRIMARILY DUE TO LESS PROPORTIONATE DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS RECORDED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , IN RELATION TO INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. THE DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS ARE RELATED TO EQUITY AWARDS VESTED AND EXERCISED AND FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF OUR COMPANY OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (\u201cCOLI\u201d) AND REDUCTIONS TO THE RESERVE FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-13, \u201cMEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.\u201d THE STANDARD INTRODUCES NEW ACCOUNTING MODELS FOR DETERMINING AND RECOGNIZING CREDIT LOSSES ON CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF CURRENT EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES AND IS EFFECTIVE FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ANALYZING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS STANDARD AND EVALUATING THE IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS INCLUDES REVIEWING CURRENT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL DIFFERENCES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM APPLYING THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE NEW STANDARD. WE COMPLETED OUR PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT AND EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF THE ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES, CONTROLS AND SYSTEMS BY THE END OF 2019. WE WILL ADOPT THIS STANDARD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AND DO NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-04, \u201cSIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.\u201d THE STANDARD SIMPLIFIES THE SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT OF GOODWILL BY REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT TO PERFORM A HYPOTHETICAL PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION TO COMPUTE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL TO MEASURE IMPAIRMENT. INSTEAD, ANY GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WILL EQUAL THE AMOUNT BY WHICH A REPORTING UNIT\u2019S CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, NOT TO EXCEED THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL. FURTHER, THE GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY REPORTING UNIT WITH A ZERO OR NEGATIVE CARRYING AMOUNT TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT AND, IF IT FAILS THAT QUALITATIVE TEST, TO PERFORM STEP 2 OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL OR ANY INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTS PERFORMED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2017.

THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE CAPITALIZED IMPLEMENTATION COSTS TO BE RECORDED AS AN OTHER ASSET, RATHER THAN A FIXED ASSET, AND THE RELATED AMORTIZATION OF THOSE COSTS TO BE RECORDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE ON A PROSPECTIVE OR RETROSPECTIVE BASIS FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. WE WILL ADOPT THIS STANDARD PROSPECTIVELY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AND DO NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE BEGAN BANKING OPERATIONS IN 2010 BY ACQUIRING DISTRESSED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND SOUGHT TO REBUILD THEM AND IMPLEMENT OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES ACROSS THE ENTERPRISE AS A WHOLE. WE FACE CONTINUAL CHALLENGES IMPLEMENTING OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, INCLUDING GROWING THE ASSETS, PARTICULARLY LOANS, AND DEPOSITS OF OUR BUSINESS AMIDST INTENSE COMPETITION, CHANGING INTEREST RATES, ADHERING TO CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND IDENTIFYING AND CONSUMMATING DISCIPLINED ACQUISITION AND OTHER EXPANSIONARY OPPORTUNITIES IN A VERY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WHILE AT THE BEGINNING OF 2019 WE ANTICIPATED A GENERALLY RISING RATE ENVIRONMENT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, PREVAILING INTEREST RATES BEGAN DECREASING DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND GENERALLY HAVE CONTINUED TO DECREASE SINCE THAT TIME AS A RESULT OF THREE FEDERAL RESERVE RATE CUTS THROUGH OCTOBER 2019.  \u200b  GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS REMAINED STABLE IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019. AMIDST NATIONAL ECONOMIC CONCERNS SURROUNDING TRADE TENSIONS AND INDICATORS OF DECREASING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE VALUES REMAIN STRONG IN OUR MARKETS AND NATIONALLY, WITH MANY MARKETS, INCLUDING DENVER, HITTING NEW POST-CRISIS HIGHS. WE CONTINUE TO SEE OUR MARKETS OUTPERFORMING NATIONAL AVERAGES ON MANY KEY INDICATORS. COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE PROPERTY FUNDAMENTALS ALSO REMAIN STRONG, WITH STABLE OCCUPANCY AND INCREASING LEASE RATES, ALONG WITH CYCLICALLY LOW CAPITALIZATION RATES LEADING TO INCREASING VALUATIONS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO IS SECURED BY REAL ESTATE AND ANY DETERIORATION IN REAL ESTATE VALUES OR CREDIT QUALITY OR ELEVATED LEVELS OF NON-PERFORMING ASSETS WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE QUALITY OF OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO.  \u200b  THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY IS IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF DEPRESSED COMMODITY PRICES. OUR FOOD AND AGRICULTURE PORTFOLIO IS ONLY 5.3% OF TOTAL LOANS AND IS WELL-DIVERSIFIED ACROSS FOOD PRODUCTION, CROP AND LIVESTOCK TYPES. CROP AND LIVESTOCK LOANS REPRESENT 1.4% OF TOTAL LOANS. WE HAVE MAINTAINED RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOOD AND AGRICULTURE CLIENTS THAT GENERALLY POSSESS LOW LEVERAGE AND, CORRESPONDINGLY, LOW BANK DEBT TO ASSETS, MINIMIZING ANY POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.  \u200b  OUR ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 TOTALED $4.3 BILLION, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $323.3 MILLION, OR 10.7% ANNUALIZED, COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2018. OUR 310-30 LOANS HAVE PRODUCED HIGHER YIELDS THAN OUR ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS, DUE TO ACCRETION OF FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE RATE ON NEW LOANS FUNDED AT THE TIME OF ORIGINATION WAS 5.05% (FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT), COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WEIGHTED AVERAGE YIELD OF OUR ORIGINATED LOAN PORTFOLIO OF 4.84% (FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT). FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT NET INTEREST INCOME REACHED AN INFLECTION POINT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017 AND CONTINUED THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AS THE YIELDS AND VOLUMES OF ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS OUTPACED THE DECREASE IN HIGHER YIELDING 310-30 LOAN BALANCES. THE INFLECTION POINT WAS DRIVEN BY STRONG NEW LOAN ORIGINATIONS. FUTURE GROWTH IN OUR INTEREST INCOME WILL ULTIMATELY BE DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT VOLUMES OF HIGH-QUALITY ORIGINATED LOANS AND FED INTEREST RATE POLICY DECISIONS.  \u200b  CONTINUED REGULATION, IMPENDING NEW LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL CONSTRAINTS, AND A CONTINUAL NEED TO BOLSTER CYBERSECURITY ARE ADDING COSTS AND UNCERTAINTY TO ALL U.S. BANKS AND COULD AFFECT PROFITABILITY. ALSO, NONTRADITIONAL PARTICIPANTS IN THE MARKET MAY OFFER INCREASED COMPETITION AS NON-BANK PAYMENT BUSINESSES, INCLUDING FINTECHS, ARE EXPANDING INTO TRADITIONAL BANKING PRODUCTS. WHILE CERTAIN EXTERNAL FACTORS ARE OUT OF OUR CONTROL AND MAY PROVIDE OBSTACLES TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE ARE PREPARED TO DEAL WITH THESE CHALLENGES. WE SEEK TO REMAIN FLEXIBLE, YET METHODICAL AND PROACTIVE, IN OUR STRATEGIC DECISION MAKING SO THAT WE CAN QUICKLY RESPOND TO MARKET CHANGES AND THE INHERENT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT ACCOMPANY SUCH CHANGES.  \u200b  44  \u200b  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW  \u200b  IN EVALUATING OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE ITEMS, WE EVALUATE AND MANAGE OUR PERFORMANCE BASED ON KEY EARNINGS INDICATORS, BALANCE SHEET RATIOS, ASSET QUALITY METRICS AND REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS, AMONG OTHERS.

WE REMEASURE THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS QUARTERLY FOR ALL 22 REMAINING LOAN POOLS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER ASC 310-30 UTILIZING THE SAME CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY USED AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. THIS REMEASUREMENT RESULTED IN A NET $5.3 MILLION AND $8.1 MILLION RECLASSIFICATION FROM NON-ACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE TO ACCRETABLE YIELD DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  \u200b  IN ADDITION TO THE ACCRETABLE YIELD ON LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER ASC 310-30, THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ON LOANS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF ASC 310-30 ARE ALSO ACCRETED TO INTEREST INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF THE LOANS.

ACCORDINGLY, FOR THE ORIGINATION OF LOANS, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A CREDIT POLICY THAT ALLOWS FOR RESPONSIVE, YET CONTROLLED LENDING WITH CREDIT APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SCALED TO LOAN SIZE. WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE CREDIT POLICY, EACH PROSPECTIVE LOAN IS REVIEWED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATENESS AND THE ADEQUACY OF THE LOAN CHARACTERISTICS AND THE SECURITY OR COLLATERAL PRIOR TO MAKING A LOAN. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND LOAN ORIGINATION PROCEDURES THAT REQUIRE APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTATION, INCLUDING FINANCIAL DATA AND CREDIT REPORTS. FOR LOANS SECURED BY REAL PROPERTY, WE REQUIRE PROPERTY APPRAISALS, TITLE INSURANCE OR A TITLE OPINION, HAZARD INSURANCE AND FLOOD INSURANCE, IN EACH CASE WHERE APPROPRIATE.  \u200b  ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES TO TIMELY IDENTIFY LOANS THAT MAY BECOME PROBLEMATIC IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE MOST BENEFICIAL RESOLUTION TO THE COMPANY. ASSET QUALITY IS MONITORED BY OUR CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT AND EVALUATED BASED ON QUANTITATIVE AND SUBJECTIVE FACTORS SUCH AS THE TIMELINESS OF CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RECEIVED. ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT ARE CONSIDERED, PARTICULARLY WITH COMMERCIAL LOANS OVER $500,000, INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY OF INDIVIDUAL BORROWERS AND GUARANTORS, IF ANY, AND THE VALUE OF OUR COLLATERAL. TO FACILITATE THE OVERSIGHT OF ASSET QUALITY, LOANS ARE CATEGORIZED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF DAYS PAST DUE AND ON AN INTERNAL RISK RATING SYSTEM, AND BOTH ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  \u200b  IN THE EVENT OF BORROWER DEFAULT, WE MAY SEEK RECOVERY IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LENDING LAWS, THE RESPECTIVE LOAN AGREEMENTS, AND CREDIT MONITORING AND REMEDIATION PROCEDURES THAT MAY INCLUDE MODIFYING OR RESTRUCTURING A LOAN FROM ITS ORIGINAL TERMS, FOR ECONOMIC OR LEGAL REASONS, TO PROVIDE A CONCESSION TO THE BORROWER FROM THEIR ORIGINAL TERMS DUE TO BORROWER FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES IN ORDER TO FACILITATE REPAYMENT. SUCH RESTRUCTURED LOANS ARE CONSIDERED TDRS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 310-40,  TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS BY CREDITORS  . UNDER THIS GUIDANCE, MODIFICATIONS TO LOANS THAT FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ASC 310-30 ARE NOT CONSIDERED TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS, REGARDLESS OF OTHERWISE MEETING THE DEFINITION OF A TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING. ASSETS THAT HAVE BEEN FORECLOSED ON OR ACQUIRED THROUGH DEED-IN-LIEU OF FORECLOSURE ARE CLASSIFIED AS OREO UNTIL SOLD, AND ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF THE RELATED LOAN BALANCE OR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL LESS ESTIMATED COSTS TO SELL, WITH ANY INITIAL VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS CHARGED TO THE ALL AND ANY SUBSEQUENT DECLINES IN CARRYING VALUE CHARGED TO IMPAIRMENTS ON OREO.  \u200b  NON-PERFORMING ASSETS AND PAST DUE LOANS  \u200b  NON-PERFORMING ASSETS CONSIST OF NON-ACCRUAL LOANS, TDRS ON NON-ACCRUAL AND OREO.  NON-ACCRUAL LOANS AND TDRS ON NON-ACCRUAL ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER ASC 310-30, AS DESCRIBED BELOW, MAY BE EXCLUDED FROM OUR NON-PERFORMING ASSETS TO THE EXTENT THAT THE CASH FLOWS OF THE LOAN POOLS ARE STILL ESTIMABLE. INTEREST INCOME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED HAD NON-ACCRUAL LOANS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR ORIGINAL CONTRACT TERMS DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $0.3 MILLION AND $1.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND $0.3 MILLION AND $1.0 MILLION DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  \u200b  ALL LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER ASC 310-30 WERE CLASSIFIED AS PERFORMING ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON THE LOAN POOLS WERE CONSIDERED ESTIMABLE. WHILE INDIVIDUAL LOANS MAKING UP THE POOLS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR ON A COST RECOVERY BASIS, THE CASH FLOWS ON THE LOAN POOLS ARE CONSIDERED ESTIMABLE AND, THEREFORE, INTEREST INCOME, THROUGH ACCRETION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE LOANS IN THE POOL AND THE POOL'S EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, IS BEING RECOGNIZED ON ALL ACQUIRED LOAN POOLS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER ASC 310-30.  \u200b  PAST DUE STATUS IS MONITORED AS AN INDICATOR OF CREDIT DETERIORATION. LOANS ARE CONSIDERED PAST DUE OR DELINQUENT WHEN THE CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST DUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT REMAINS UNPAID AFTER THE DUE DATE OF THE SCHEDULED PAYMENT. ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS THAT ARE 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE ARE PUT ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS UNLESS THE LOAN IS WELL SECURED AND IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION.  \u200b  56  \u200b  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE NON-PERFORMING ASSETS AND PAST DUE LOANS AS OF THE DATES PRESENTED.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  DECEMBER 31, 2018  NON-ACCRUAL LOANS.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  TOTAL NON-ACCRUAL LOANS, EXCLUDING RESTRUCTURED LOANS  $19,268  \u200b  $21,017  TOTAL RESTRUCTURED LOANS ON NON-ACCRUAL  6,130  \u200b  3,439  TOTAL NON-PERFORMING LOANS  25,398  \u200b  24,456  OREO  7,904  \u200b  10,596  TOTAL NON-PERFORMING ASSETS  $33,302  \u200b  $35,052  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  LOANS 30-89 DAYS PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING INTEREST  $6,723  \u200b  $4,610  LOANS 90 DAYS PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING INTEREST  1,968  \u200b  895  TOTAL NON-ACCRUAL LOANS  \u200b  25,398  \u200b  \u200b  24,456  TOTAL PAST DUE AND NON-ACCRUAL LOANS  $34,089  \u200b  $29,961  ACCRUING RESTRUCTURED LOANS  $7,384  \u200b  $5,944  ALL  $38,710  \u200b  $35,692  TOTAL NON-PERFORMING LOANS TO TOTAL LOANS  0.58%  \u200b  0.60%  LOANS 90 DAYS OR MORE PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING INTEREST TO TOTAL LOANS  0.04%  \u200b  0.02%  TOTAL 90 DAYS PAST DUE AND STILL ACCRUING INTEREST AND NON-ACCRUAL LOANS TO TOTAL ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS  0.63%  \u200b  0.63%  TOTAL NON-PERFORMING ASSETS TO TOTAL LOANS AND OREO  0.76%  \u200b  0.85%  ALL TO NON-PERFORMING LOANS  152.41%  \u200b  145.94%  \u200b  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, TOTAL NON-PERFORMING LOANS INCREASED $0.9 MILLION TO $25.4 MILLION FROM DECEMBER 31, 2018.

THERE WERE NO ASC 310-30 LOAN POOLS PAST DUE OR ON NON-ACCRUAL AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 OR DECEMBER 31, 2018.  \u200b  ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES  \u200b  THE ALL REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT THAT WE BELIEVE IS NECESSARY TO ABSORB PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE AND INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND COMPLEXITY. DETERMINATION OF THE ALL IS BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF THE COLLECTABILITY OF LOANS, THE REALIZABLE VALUE OF UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, HISTORICAL NET LOAN LOSSES, THE ESTIMATED LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD, ESTIMATED DEFAULT RATES, ANY DECLINES IN CASH FLOW ASSUMPTIONS FROM ACQUISITION, LOAN STRUCTURES, GROWTH FACTORS AND OTHER ELEMENTS THAT WARRANT RECOGNITION AND, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, PRIOR LOSS EXPERIENCE. THE ALL IS CRITICAL TO THE PORTRAYAL AND UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE DETERMINATION AND APPLICATION OF THE ALL ACCOUNTING POLICY INVOLVES JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. CHANGES IN THESE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES OR THE CONDITIONS SURROUNDING THEM MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u200b  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE GUIDANCE FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, ACQUIRED LOANS WERE RECORDED AT THEIR ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES, WHICH WERE BASED ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND INCLUDED AN ESTIMATE FOR FUTURE LOAN LOSSES; THEREFORE, NO ALL WAS RECORDED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. ANY ESTIMATED LOSSES ON ACQUIRED LOANS THAT ARISE AFTER THE ACQUISITION DATE ARE REFLECTED IN A CHARGE TO THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u200b  ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED ALL  \u200b  FOR ALL ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS, THE DETERMINATION OF THE ALL FOLLOWS A PROCESS TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ALL THAT IS DESIGNED TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES IN CREDIT QUALITY AND OTHER RISK FACTORS. THIS PROCESS PROVIDES AN ALL CONSISTING OF A SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE COMPONENT BASED ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALLY EVALUATED LOANS AND A GENERAL ALLOWANCE COMPONENT BASED ON ESTIMATES OF RESERVES NEEDED FOR ALL OTHER LOANS, SEGMENTED BASED ON SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS.  \u200b  57  \u200b  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPAIRED LOANS LESS THAN $250,000 ARE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL ALLOWANCE POPULATION. IMPAIRED LOANS OVER $250,000 ARE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL EVALUATION ON A REGULAR BASIS TO DETERMINE THE NEED, IF ANY, TO ALLOCATE A SPECIFIC RESERVE TO THE IMPAIRED LOAN. TYPICALLY, THESE LOANS CONSIST OF COMMERCIAL, COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AND FOOD AND AGRICULTURE LOANS AND EXCLUDE HOMOGENEOUS LOANS SUCH AS RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND CONSUMER LOANS. SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES ARE DETERMINED BY COLLECTIVELY ANALYZING.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u25cf  THE BORROWER'S RESOURCES, ABILITY, AND WILLINGNESS TO REPAY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT;  \u25cf  THE LIKELIHOOD OF RECEIVING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM ANY GUARANTORS;  \u25cf  THE ADEQUACY AND PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, LESS DISPOSAL COSTS, OF ANY COLLATERAL; AND  \u25cf  THE IMPACT CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY HAVE ON THE BORROWER'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY OR THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL.  \u200b  IN EVALUATING THE LOAN PORTFOLIO FOR AN APPROPRIATE ALL LEVEL, UNIMPAIRED LOANS ARE GROUPED INTO SEGMENTS BASED ON BROAD CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS PRIMARY USE AND UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED FOUR PRIMARY LOAN SEGMENTS THAT ARE FURTHER STRATIFIED INTO 11 LOAN CLASSES TO PROVIDE MORE GRANULARITY IN ANALYZING LOSS HISTORY AND TO ALLOW FOR MORE DEFINITIVE QUALITATIVE ADJUSTMENTS BASED UPON SPECIFIC FACTORS AFFECTING EACH LOAN CLASS. FOLLOWING ARE THE LOAN CLASSES WITHIN EACH OF THE FOUR PRIMARY LOAN SEGMENTS.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  NON-OWNER OCCUPIED  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  COMMERCIAL  \u200b  COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE  \u200b  RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE  \u200b  CONSUMER  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL  \u200b  CONSTRUCTION  \u200b  SENIOR LIEN  \u200b  TOTAL CONSUMER  OWNER OCCUPIED COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE  \u200b  ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT  \u200b  JUNIOR LIEN  \u200b  \u200b  FOOD AND AGRICULTURE  \u200b  MULTIFAMILY  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  ENERGY  \u200b  NON-OWNER OCCUPIED  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  APPROPRIATE ALL LEVELS ARE DETERMINED BY SEGMENT AND CLASS UTILIZING RISK RATINGS, LOSS HISTORY, PEER LOSS HISTORY AND QUALITATIVE ADJUSTMENTS. THE QUALITATIVE ADJUSTMENTS CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u25cf  ECONOMIC/EXTERNAL CONDITIONS;  \u25cf  LOAN ADMINISTRATION, LOAN STRUCTURE AND PROCEDURES;  \u25cf  RISK TOLERANCE/EXPERIENCE;  \u25cf  LOAN GROWTH;  \u25cf  TRENDS;  \u25cf  CONCENTRATIONS; AND  \u25cf  \u200b  OTHER.  \u200b  MANAGEMENT DERIVES AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL LOSS RATE ADJUSTED FOR AN ESTIMATED LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD BASED ON HISTORICAL LOSS DATA CATEGORIZED BY SEGMENT AND CLASS. THE LOSS RATES ARE APPLIED AT THE LOAN SEGMENT AND CLASS LEVEL. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS OUR LACK OF HISTORICAL LOSS DATA ENCOMPASSING A FULL ECONOMIC CYCLE, WE INCORPORATE NOT ONLY OUR OWN HISTORICAL LOSS RATES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2012, BUT WE ALSO UTILIZE PEER HISTORICAL LOSS DATA, INCLUDING A HISTORICAL AVERAGE NET CHARGE-OFF RATIO ON EACH LOAN TYPE, RELYING ON THE UNIFORM BANK PERFORMANCE REPORTS COMPILED BY THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATIONS COUNCIL (\u201cFFIEC\u201d). FOR ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS, WE ASSIGN A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PORTION OF OUR LOSS HISTORY, BUT STILL RELY ON THE PEER LOSS HISTORY TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR LIMITED HISTORICAL DATA.  \u200b  THE COLLECTIVE RESULTING ALL FOR ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS IS CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF THE SPECIFIC RESERVES AND THE GENERAL RESERVES. WHILE THESE AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED BY INDIVIDUAL LOAN OR SEGMENT AND CLASS, THE ENTIRE ALL IS AVAILABLE FOR ANY LOAN THAT, IN OUR JUDGMENT, SHOULD BE CHARGED-OFF.  \u200b  PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $5.7 MILLION AND $10.5 MILLION WAS RECORDED DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, TO SUPPORT ORIGINATED LOAN GROWTH AND NET CHARGE-OFFS. INCLUDED IN PROVISION EXPENSE DURING THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS WAS $4.2 MILLION AND $6.6 MILLION RELATED TO ONE PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED COMMERCIAL LOAN THAT WAS PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. NET CHARGE-OFFS DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 TOTALED $7.1 MILLION, OR 0.66% ANNUALIZED, AND $7.4 MILLION, OR 0.24% ANNUALIZED, RESPECTIVELY, AND INCLUDED $6.6 MILLION RELATED TO THE LOAN DESCRIBED ABOVE. SPECIFIC RESERVES ON IMPAIRED LOANS TOTALED $1.8 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  \u200b  DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, $0.8 MILLION AND $2.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS RECORDED FOR GENERAL RESERVES ON LOAN GROWTH. NET RECOVERIES FOR ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS DURING THE  58  \u200b  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 TOTALED $0.8 MILLION, AND NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 TOTALED $0.2 MILLION, OR 0.01% ANNUALIZED. SPECIFIC RESERVES ON IMPAIRED LOANS TOTALED $1.5 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  \u200b  310-30 ALL  \u200b  LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN ASC 310-30 HAVE BEEN GROUPED INTO POOLS BASED ON THE PREDOMINANT RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF PURPOSE AND/OR TYPE OF LOAN. THE TIMING AND RECEIPT OF EXPECTED PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND ANY OTHER CASH FLOWS OF THESE LOANS ARE PERIODICALLY REMEASURED AND THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE COLLECTIVE POOLS ARE COMPARED TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE POOLS. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH POOL IS LESS THAN THE BOOK VALUE OF THE POOL, AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WILL BE ESTABLISHED THROUGH A CHARGE TO THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. IF THE REMEASURED EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE GREATER THAN THE BOOK VALUE OF THE POOLS, THEN THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS IS ACCRETED INTO INTEREST INCOME OVER THE REMAINING EXPECTED LIFE OF THE LOAN POOL. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, THESE REMEASUREMENTS RESULTED IN OVERALL INCREASES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS IN CERTAIN LOAN POOLS, WHICH, ABSENT PREVIOUS VALUATION ALLOWANCES WITHIN THE SAME POOL, ARE REFLECTED IN INCREASED ACCRETION AS WELL AS AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF ACCRETABLE YIELD AND ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE EXPECTED REMAINING LIVES OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO YIELD.  \u200b  DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER ASC 310-30 HAD RECOUPMENT OF $11 THOUSAND AND $51 THOUSAND, RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER ASC 310-30 HAD $6 THOUSAND AND $197 THOUSAND OF PROVISION, RESPECTIVELY.  \u200b  TOTAL ALL  \u200b  AFTER CONSIDERING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED FACTORS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE ALL OF $38.7 MILLION IS ADEQUATE TO COVER PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. HOWEVER, IT IS LIKELY THAT FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ALL WILL BE NECESSARY AND ANY CHANGES TO THE ASSUMPTIONS, CIRCUMSTANCES OR ESTIMATES USED IN DETERMINING THE ALL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DIFFERS FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK COMPENSATION ACTIVITY, INTEREST INCOME FROM TAX-EXEMPT LENDING, BANK-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE INCOME, AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF THESE ITEMS TO PRE-TAX INCOME. THE COMPANY FORECASTS THE FULL YEAR ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 740.

THE GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE DETAILED IN NOTE 3 OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, ALL OF WHICH WERE ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR SPONSORED ENTERPRISES. THE ANTICIPATED REPAYMENTS AND MARKETABILITY OF THESE SECURITIES OFFER SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND FLEXIBILITY TO MEET NEW LOAN DEMAND, REINVEST IN THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, OR PROVIDE OPTIONALITY FOR REDUCTIONS IN OUR DEPOSIT FUNDING BASE.  \u200b  AT PRESENT, FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF CHANGES IN DEPOSITS AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND ADVANCES FROM THE FHLB, IN ADDITION TO THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND THE REPURCHASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. MATURING TIME DEPOSITS REPRESENT A POTENTIAL USE OF FUNDS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, $731.1 MILLION OF TIME DEPOSITS WERE SCHEDULED TO MATURE WITHIN 12 MONTHS. BASED ON THE CURRENT INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUR CONSUMER BANKING STRATEGY FOCUSING ON BOTH LOWER COST TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS AND TERM DEPOSITS, OUR STRATEGY IS TO REPLACE A PORTION OF THOSE MATURING TIME DEPOSITS WITH TRANSACTION DEPOSITS AND MARKET-RATE TIME DEPOSITS.  \u200b  UNDER THE BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY AND THE BANK MET ALL CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS AND THE BANK HAD REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS IN EXCESS OF THE LEVELS ESTABLISHED FOR WELL-CAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON REGULATORY CAPITAL, SEE NOTE 10 IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u200b  OUR SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY IS IMPACTED BY EARNINGS, CHANGES IN UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON SECURITIES, NET OF TAX, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ACTIVITY, SHARE REPURCHASES AND THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.  \u200b  70  \u200b  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS AUTHORIZED MULTIPLE PROGRAMS TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME EITHER IN OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE REGULATIONS OF THE SEC. ON AUGUST 5, 2016, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $50.0 MILLION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK. THE REMAINING AUTHORIZATION UNDER THIS PROGRAM AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $12.6 MILLION. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  \u200b  ON NOVEMBER 6, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.20 PER COMMON SHARE, PAYABLE ON DECEMBER 13, 2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON NOVEMBER 29, 2019.  \u200b  ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT AND INTEREST RATE RISK  \u200b  MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING INTEREST RATE RISK AND EMPLOYING RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES THAT MONITOR AND LIMIT THIS EXPOSURE. INTEREST RATE RISK IS MEASURED USING NET INTEREST INCOME SIMULATIONS AND MARKET VALUE OF PORTFOLIO EQUITY ANALYSES. THESE ANALYSES USE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THE NATURE AND TIMING OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, YIELD CURVE SHAPE, PREPAYMENTS ON LOANS AND SECURITIES, DEPOSIT DECAY RATES, PRICING DECISIONS ON LOANS AND DEPOSITS AND REINVESTMENT/REPLACEMENT OF ASSET AND LIABILITY CASH FLOWS.  \u200b  THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE OF THE COMPANY'S ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT FUNCTION IS TO EVALUATE THE INTEREST RATE RISK WITHIN THE BALANCE SHEET AND PURSUE A CONTROLLED ASSUMPTION OF INTEREST RATE RISK WHILE MAXIMIZING EARNINGS AND PRESERVING ADEQUATE LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL. THE ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT FUNCTION IS UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE ASSET LIABILITY COMMITTEE FROM DIRECTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE ASSET LIABILITY COMMITTEE MEETS MONTHLY TO REVIEW, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SENSITIVITY OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES, LOCAL AND NATIONAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND RATES. THE ASSET LIABILITY COMMITTEE ALSO REVIEWS THE LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL, DEPOSIT MIX, LOAN MIX AND INVESTMENT POSITIONS OF THE COMPANY.  \u200b  INSTANTANEOUS PARALLEL RATE SHIFT SCENARIOS ARE MODELED AND UTILIZED TO EVALUATE RISK AND ESTABLISH EXPOSURE LIMITS FOR ACCEPTABLE CHANGES IN NET INTEREST MARGIN. THESE SCENARIOS, KNOWN AS RATE SHOCKS, SIMULATE AN INSTANTANEOUS CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES AND USE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PREPAYMENTS ON LOANS AND SECURITIES, DEPOSIT DECAY RATES, PRICING DECISIONS ON LOANS AND DEPOSITS, REINVESTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF ASSET AND LIABILITY CASH FLOWS.  \u200b  WE ALSO ANALYZE THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY AS A SECONDARY MEASURE OF INTEREST RATE RISK. THIS IS A COMPLEMENTARY MEASURE TO NET INTEREST INCOME WHERE THE CALCULATED VALUE IS THE RESULT OF THE MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS LESS THE MARKET VALUE OF LIABILITIES. THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY IS A LONGER TERM VIEW OF INTEREST RATE RISK BECAUSE IT MEASURES THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS. THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ON THIS CALCULATION IS ANALYZED FOR THE RISK TO OUR FUTURE EARNINGS AND IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ANALYSES ON NET INTEREST INCOME.  \u200b  OUR INTEREST RATE RISK MODEL INDICATED THAT THE COMPANY WAS ASSET SENSITIVE IN TERMS OF INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE DECREASED OUR ASSET SENSITIVITY IN A DECLINING RATE ENVIRONMENT AS A RESULT OF THE BALANCE SHEET MIX TOWARD MORE FIXED RATE ASSETS. THE TABLE BELOW ILLUSTRATES THE IMPACT OF AN IMMEDIATE AND SUSTAINED 200 AND 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE AND A 100 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES ON NET INTEREST INCOME BASED ON THE INTEREST RATE RISK MODEL AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  HYPOTHETICAL  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  SHIFT IN INTEREST  \u200b% CHANGE IN PROJECTED NET INTEREST INCOME  RATES (IN BPS)  \u200b  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  DECEMBER 31, 2018  200  \u200b  5.96%  \u200b  5.86%  100  \u200b  3.05%  \u200b  2.98%  (100)  \u200b  (4.13)%  \u200b  (4.84)%  \u200b  MANY ASSUMPTIONS ARE USED TO CALCULATE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS.

NON-MATURING DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS HAVE GROWN $211.5 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AND IMPROVED TO 77.5% OF TOTAL DEPOSITS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 76.2% AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO BROKERED TIME DEPOSITS.  \u200b  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ACTIVITIES  \u200b  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ARE A PARTY TO VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ACTIVITIES THAT CONTAIN CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISK THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE ARE THE LOAN COMMITMENTS THAT WE ENTER INTO TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT, COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER LINES OF CREDIT AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAD LOAN COMMITMENTS TOTALING $801.1 MILLION AND $773.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT THAT TOTALED $11.7 MILLION AND $10.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. UNUSED COMMITMENTS DO NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR CASH REQUIREMENTS, AS COMMITMENTS OFTEN EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING DRAWN UPON. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL LOSSES ARISING FROM COMMITMENTS OR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ANY MATERIAL COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT THAT REPRESENT RISKS OF AN UNUSUAL NATURE.  \u200b", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "National Bank Holdings Corp", "CIK": 1475841, "Date": "2019-11-06T00:00:00", "Ticker": "NBHC", "Name": "National Bank Holdings Corp", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 6021.0, "Business": "CO", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 270563799.0, "key": "20191106NBHC", "labelr1": 0.5913827090960317, "labelr2": -0.11198208286673894, "labelr3": -0.4204035874439422, "labelr4": -0.3095975232198126, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.1324192, "prof1": 0.86758083, "return1&2": 1.0047873838355392, "return1&2&3": 1.0005632216277105, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9974655026753028, "return2": 0.9988801791713326, "return1": 1.0059138270909602, "return3": 0.9957959641255606, "return4": 0.9969040247678018, "1_day_return": 0.5913827090960222, "cumulative_return1": 0.0012000101657537654, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.0005676630111315363, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 1.233981089064405e-05, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1.109968519591525e-05, "indexx": 3037, "cumreturn1b": 0.4868731014106512, "cumreturndow": 1.0059571427020124, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0119734194994836}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3157, "level_0": 6535, "index": 92958, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS INTENDED TO FURTHER THE READER\u2019S UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR COMPANY. IT SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018  (OUR \u201c  2018  ANNUAL REPORT\u201d). THESE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS A NUMBER OF FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE UNCERTAINTIES AND RISKS REFERRED TO UNDER \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN ITEM 1A IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT. AS USED HEREIN, \u201cCOTT,\u201d \u201cTHE COMPANY,\u201d \u201cCOTT CORPORATION,\u201d \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cUS,\u201d OR \u201cOUR\u201d REFERS TO COTT CORPORATION, TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.  OVERVIEW  COTT IS A WATER, COFFEE, TEA, EXTRACTS AND FILTRATION SERVICE COMPANY WITH A LEADING VOLUME-BASED NATIONAL PRESENCE IN THE NORTH AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN HOME AND OFFICE DELIVERY INDUSTRY FOR BOTTLED WATER, AND A LEADER IN CUSTOM COFFEE ROASTING, ICED TEA BLENDING, AND EXTRACT SOLUTIONS FOR THE U.S. FOODSERVICE INDUSTRY. OUR PLATFORM REACHES OVER  2.5 MILLION  CUSTOMERS OR DELIVERY POINTS ACROSS NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE AND IS SUPPORTED BY STRATEGICALLY LOCATED SALES AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND FLEETS, AS WELL AS WHOLESALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS. THIS ENABLES US TO EFFICIENTLY SERVICE RESIDENCES, BUSINESSES, RESTAURANT CHAINS, HOTELS AND MOTELS, SMALL AND LARGE RETAILERS, AND HEALTHCARE FACILITIES.  INGREDIENT AND PACKAGING COSTS REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR COST OF SALES. THESE COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO GLOBAL AND REGIONAL COMMODITY PRICE TRENDS. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT COMMODITIES ARE GREEN COFFEE, TEA, POLYETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE RESIN, HIGH-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE AND POLYCARBONATE BOTTLES, CAPS AND PREFORMS, LABELS AND CARTONS AND TRAYS. WE ATTEMPT TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INGREDIENT AND PACKAGING COSTS BY ENTERING INTO FIXED PRICE COMMITMENTS FOR A PORTION OF OUR INGREDIENT AND PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS AND IMPLEMENTING PRICE INCREASES AS NEEDED.  WE CONDUCT OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES INVOLVING TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN A VARIETY OF CURRENCIES. WE ARE SUBJECT TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR COSTS ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THOSE IN WHICH WE EARN REVENUES. AS OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS, FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND OTHER CURRENCIES HAVE HAD, AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  , WE REVIEWED AND REALIGNED OUR REPORTING SEGMENTS TO REFLECT HOW THE BUSINESS WILL BE MANAGED AND THE RESULTS WILL BE REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, WHO IS THE COMPANY\u2019S CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER. FOLLOWING SUCH REVIEW, WE REALIGNED OUR THREE REPORTING SEGMENTS AS FOLLOWS: ROUTE BASED SERVICES (WHICH INCLUDES OUR DS SERVICES OF AMERICA, INC. (\u201cDSS\u201d), AQUATERRA CORPORATION (\u201cAQUATERRA\u201d), MOUNTAIN VALLEY SPRING COMPANY (\u201cMOUNTAIN VALLEY\u201d), EDEN SPRINGS EUROPE B.V. (\u201cEDEN\u201d) AND AIMIA FOODS (\u201cAIMIA\u201d) BUSINESSES); COFFEE, TEA & EXTRACT SOLUTIONS (WHICH INCLUDES OUR S. & D. COFFEE, INC. (\u201cS&D\u201d) BUSINESS); AND ALL OTHER (WHICH INCLUDES MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES AND OUR COTT BEVERAGES LLC BUSINESS, WHICH WAS SOLD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019). OUR SEGMENT REPORTING RESULTS HAVE BEEN RECAST TO REFLECT THESE CHANGES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  DIVESTITURE TRANSACTION  ON FEBRUARY 8, 2019, WE SOLD ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY OF COTT BEVERAGES LLC, WHICH OPERATED OUR SOFT DRINK CONCENTRATE PRODUCTION BUSINESS AND OUR ROYAL CROWN INTERNATIONAL (\u201cRCI\u201d) DIVISION, TO REFRESCO GROUP B.V., A DUTCH BEVERAGE MANUFACTURER (\u201cREFRESCO\u201d). THE AGGREGATE DEAL CONSIDERATION PAID AT CLOSING WAS  $50.0 MILLION  , SUBJECT TO POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, INDEBTEDNESS AND OTHER CUSTOMARY ITEMS. THE SALE OF COTT BEVERAGES LLC RESULTED IN A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY  $6.0 MILLION  THAT WAS RECORDED TO OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 28, 2019. WE USED THE PROCEEDS OF THIS TRANSACTION TO REPAY A PORTION OF THE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR ASSET-BASED LENDING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cABL FACILITY\u201d).  31  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  IN ADDITION TO HISTORICAL INFORMATION, THIS REPORT, AND ANY DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED IN THIS REPORT BY REFERENCE, MAY CONTAIN STATEMENTS RELATING TO FUTURE EVENTS AND FUTURE RESULTS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING\u201d WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND APPLICABLE CANADIAN SECURITIES LEGISLATION AND INVOLVE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, FUTURE EXPECTATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS OF COTT CORPORATION TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY FUTURE RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH STATEMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, STATEMENTS THAT RELATE TO PROJECTIONS OF SALES, CASH FLOWS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OTHER FINANCIAL ITEMS, STATEMENTS REGARDING OUR INTENTIONS TO PAY REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON SHARES, AND DISCUSSIONS OF ESTIMATED FUTURE REVENUE ENHANCEMENTS AND COST SAVINGS. THESE STATEMENTS ALSO RELATE TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS CONCERNING OUR MARKET POSITION, FUTURE OPERATIONS, MARGINS, PROFITABILITY, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.

THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REFLECT CURRENT EXPECTATIONS REGARDING FUTURE EVENTS AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND ARE MADE ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT.  THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEES OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR EVENTS AND, BY THEIR NATURE, ARE BASED ON CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING INTEREST AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, EXPECTED GROWTH, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, PERFORMANCE, BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND OPPORTUNITIES AND EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. MATERIAL FACTORS OR ASSUMPTIONS THAT WERE APPLIED IN DRAWING A CONCLUSION OR MAKING AN ESTIMATE SET OUT IN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING MANAGEMENT\u2019S CURRENT PLANS AND ESTIMATES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE REASONABLE, ANY OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS COULD PROVE TO BE INACCURATE AND, AS A RESULT, THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BASED ON THOSE ASSUMPTIONS COULD PROVE TO BE INCORRECT. OUR OPERATIONS INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, AND ANY ONE OR ANY COMBINATION OF THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES COULD ALSO AFFECT WHETHER THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ULTIMATELY PROVE TO BE CORRECT. THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE DESCRIBED IN PART I, ITEM 1A. \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT, AND THOSE DESCRIBED FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR FUTURE REPORTS FILED WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) AND CANADIAN SECURITIES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.  THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, SALES, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS, OR COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATES CONTAINED IN OR UNDERLYING THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE;  \u2022  FLUCTUATIONS IN COMMODITY PRICES AND OUR ABILITY TO PASS ON INCREASED COSTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OR HEDGE AGAINST SUCH RISING COSTS, AND THE IMPACT OF THOSE INCREASED PRICES ON OUR VOLUMES;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR OPERATIONS SUCCESSFULLY;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO FULLY REALIZE THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE PURSUE;  \u2022  POTENTIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RECENT DIVESTITURES;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE REVENUE AND COST SYNERGIES OF OUR ACQUISITIONS DUE TO INTEGRATION DIFFICULTIES AND OTHER CHALLENGES;  \u2022  OUR EXPOSURE TO INTANGIBLE ASSET RISK;  \u2022  CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND THE BRITISH POUND STERLING, THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE EURO, THE CANADIAN DOLLAR AND OTHER CURRENCIES AND THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE BRITISH POUND STERLING AND THE EURO;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN FAVORABLE ARRANGEMENTS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS, AND RISKS OF FURTHER INCREASES TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS AND CONDITIONS UNDER OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS;  \u2022  FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS;  \u2022  THE INCURRENCE OF SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS TO FINANCE OUR ACQUISITIONS;  \u2022  THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL FINANCIAL EVENTS ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OTHER ADVERSE CHANGES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS;  \u2022  ANY DISRUPTION TO PRODUCTION AT OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES;  32  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO OUR WATER SOURCES;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY;  \u2022  COMPLIANCE WITH PRODUCT HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS;  \u2022  LIABILITY FOR INJURY OR ILLNESS CAUSED BY THE CONSUMPTION OF CONTAMINATED PRODUCTS;  \u2022  LIABILITY AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AS A RESULT OF LITIGATION OR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS;  \u2022  CHANGES IN THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE;  \u2022  THE SEASONAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS AND THE EFFECT OF ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS;  \u2022  THE IMPACT OF NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL EVENTS, INCLUDING THOSE OF A POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, BUSINESS AND COMPETITIVE NATURE;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT, RETAIN AND INTEGRATE NEW MANAGEMENT;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO RENEW OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ON SATISFACTORY TERMS;  \u2022  DISRUPTIONS IN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO SECURELY MAINTAIN OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 CONFIDENTIAL OR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION, OR OTHER PRIVATE DATA RELATING TO OUR EMPLOYEES OR OUR COMPANY;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND ADDRESS DIFFICULTIES IN COMPLYING WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDING THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND THE U.K. BRIBERY ACT OF 2010;  \u2022  INCREASED TAX LIABILITIES IN THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE TAX ATTRIBUTES TO OFFSET FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME;  \u2022  THE IMPACT OF THE 2017 TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ON OUR TAX OBLIGATIONS AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE; OR  \u2022  CREDIT RATING CHANGES.  WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT OR TO PUBLICLY RELEASE THE RESULTS OF ANY REVISIONS TO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS TO REFLECT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH WE MAY BECOME AWARE OF AFTER THE DATE OF THIS REPORT. UNDUE RELIANCE SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, AND ALL FUTURE WRITTEN AND ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO US OR PERSONS ACTING ON OUR BEHALF ARE EXPRESSLY QUALIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BY THE FOREGOING.  NON-GAAP MEASURES  IN THIS REPORT, WE SUPPLEMENT OUR REPORTING OF FINANCIAL MEASURES DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) BY UTILIZING CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT EXCLUDE CERTAIN ITEMS TO MAKE PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD COMPARISONS FOR OUR UNDERLYING OPERATIONS BEFORE MATERIAL CHANGES. WE EXCLUDE THESE ITEMS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS. WE EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO SEPARATE THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES FROM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  WE ALSO UTILIZE EARNINGS (LOSS) BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), WHICH IS GAAP NET INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, EXPENSE FOR INCOME TAXES AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. WE CONSIDER EBITDA TO BE AN INDICATOR OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE. WE ALSO USE EBITDA, AS DO ANALYSTS, LENDERS, INVESTORS AND OTHERS, BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES CERTAIN ITEMS THAT CAN VARY WIDELY ACROSS DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES OR AMONG COMPANIES WITHIN THE SAME INDUSTRY. THESE DIFFERENCES CAN RESULT IN CONSIDERABLE VARIABILITY IN THE RELATIVE COSTS OF PRODUCTIVE ASSETS AND THE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AMONG COMPANIES. WE ALSO UTILIZE ADJUSTED EBITDA, WHICH IS EBITDA EXCLUDING ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS, LOSS ON COMMODITY HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, NET, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND OTHER LOSSES (GAINS), NET, LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET, GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT, LOSS (GAIN) ON SALE OF BUSINESS, OPERATIONS OF COTT BEVERAGES LLC, AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS, NET, AS THE CASE MAY BE (\u201cADJUSTED EBITDA\u201d). WE CONSIDER ADJUSTED EBITDA TO BE AN INDICATOR OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  33  BECAUSE WE USE THESE ADJUSTED FINANCIAL RESULTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS AND TO UNDERSTAND UNDERLYING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, WE BELIEVE THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS FOR THEIR INDEPENDENT EVALUATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR MANAGEMENT. THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT MEANT TO BE CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, OR A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. IN ADDITION, THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT REFLECT OUR JUDGMENT OF PARTICULAR ITEMS, AND MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM, AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO, SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

IN ADDITION, OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCES AS OF  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , INCLUDE MARGIN ACCOUNT BALANCES RELATED TO OUR COFFEE FUTURES OF  $3.8 MILLION  AND  $12.9 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MARGIN ACCOUNT BALANCES IN ACCORDANCE WITH FUTURES MARKET AND BROKER REGULATIONS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR LEVEL OF RESOURCES, WHICH INCLUDES CASH ON HAND, AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR ABL FACILITY AND FUNDS PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATIONS, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR EXPENSES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH TO MEET OUR CURRENT EXPENSES AND DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS WILL DEPEND ON OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. IF WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH CASH TO PAY OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS, OR IF THE ABL FACILITY OR OUR OUTSTANDING NOTES WERE TO BECOME CURRENTLY DUE, EITHER AT MATURITY OR AS A RESULT OF A BREACH, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO TAKE ACTIONS SUCH AS AMENDING OUR ABL FACILITY OR THE INDENTURES GOVERNING OUR OUTSTANDING NOTES, REFINANCING ALL OR PART OF OUR EXISTING DEBT, SELLING ASSETS, INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS OR RAISING EQUITY. THE ABL FACILITY IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS AND THOSE OF THE RESPECTIVE GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES. IF THE ABL FACILITY WERE TO BECOME CURRENTLY DUE, THE LENDERS MAY HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORECLOSE ON SUCH ASSETS. IF WE NEED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FINANCING, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  , OUR TOTAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY WAS  $219.7 MILLION  , WHICH WAS BASED ON OUR BORROWING BASE (ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES, INVENTORY, AND FIXED ASSETS AS OF THE SEPTEMBER  2019  MONTH-END UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT GOVERNING THE ABL FACILITY). WE HAD  $82.2 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE ABL FACILITY AND  $46.1 MILLION  IN OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT. AS A RESULT, OUR EXCESS AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY WAS  $91.4 MILLION  . EACH MONTH\u2019S BORROWING BASE IS NOT EFFECTIVE UNTIL SUBMITTED TO THE LENDERS, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF THE FOLLOWING MONTH.  WE EARN A PORTION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME IN SUBSIDIARIES LOCATED OUTSIDE OF CANADA. WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED FOR FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF OUR NON-CANADIAN SUBSIDIARIES. WE EXPECT THAT THESE EARNINGS WILL BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED BY SUCH SUBSIDIARIES EXCEPT IN CERTAIN INSTANCES WHERE REPATRIATION ATTRIBUTABLE TO CURRENT EARNINGS RESULTS IN MINIMAL OR NO TAX CONSEQUENCES.  41  WE EXPECT OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS AND THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH FLOWS OUTSIDE OF CANADA TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.  A FUTURE CHANGE TO OUR ASSERTION THAT FOREIGN EARNINGS WILL BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INCOME TAXES AND/OR WITHHOLDING TAXES PAYABLE, WHERE APPLICABLE. THEREFORE, A HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD OCCUR DURING THE PERIOD OF REPATRIATION.  WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WHETHER OUR OUTSTANDING NOTES ARE THEN TRADING AT A DISCOUNT TO THEIR FACE AMOUNT, REPURCHASE OUR OUTSTANDING NOTES FOR CASH AND/OR IN EXCHANGE FOR OUR COMMON SHARES, WARRANTS, PREFERRED SHARES, DEBT OR OTHER CONSIDERATION, IN EACH CASE IN OPEN MARKET PURCHASES AND/OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE AMOUNTS INVOLVED IN ANY SUCH TRANSACTIONS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE MATERIAL. HOWEVER, THE COVENANTS IN OUR ABL FACILITY SUBJECT SUCH PURCHASES TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND CONDITIONS.  A DIVIDEND OF  $0.06  PER COMMON SHARE HAS BEEN DECLARED DURING EACH QUARTER OF  2019  FOR AGGREGATE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $24.5 MILLION.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A GLOBAL PATIENT-DEDICATED BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY ENGAGED IN THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT, AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF A DIVERSE SET OF NOVEL TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS LIVING WITH RARE DISEASES. WE HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES LED BY OUR NOVEL MEDICINE FOR FABRY DISEASE THAT HAS ACHIEVED WIDESPREAD GLOBAL APPROVAL, A DIFFERENTIATED BIOLOGIC FOR POMPE DISEASE IN THE CLINIC, AND AN INDUSTRY LEADING RARE DISEASE GENE THERAPY PORTFOLIO.  THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR PORTFOLIO IS GALAFOLD  \u00ae  (ALSO REFERRED TO AS \"MIGALASTAT\"), THE FIRST AND ONLY APPROVED ORAL PRECISION MEDICINE FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH FABRY DISEASE WHO HAVE AMENABLE GENETIC VARIANTS. MIGALASTAT IS CURRENTLY APPROVED UNDER THE TRADE NAME GALAFOLD  \u00ae  IN THE UNITED STATES (\"U.S.\"), EUROPEAN UNION (\"E.U.\"), AND JAPAN, WITH ADDITIONAL APPROVALS GRANTED AND APPLICATIONS PENDING IN SEVERAL GEOGRAPHIES.  THE LEAD BIOLOGICS PROGRAM OF OUR PIPELINE IS AMICUS THERAPEUTICS GAA (\"AT-GAA\", ALSO KNOWN AS ATB200/AT2221), A NOVEL, CLINICAL-STAGE, POTENTIAL BEST-IN-CLASS TREATMENT PARADIGM FOR POMPE DISEASE. IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\"FDA\") GRANTED BREAKTHROUGH THERAPY DESIGNATION TO AT-GAA FOR THE TREATMENT OF LATE ONSET POMPE DISEASE.  WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN INDUSTRY LEADING GENE THERAPY PORTFOLIO OF POTENTIAL THERAPIES FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH RARE METABOLIC DISEASES, THROUGH A LICENSE WITH NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (\"NCH\") AND AN EXPANDED COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA (\"PENN\"). OUR PIPELINE INCLUDES GENE THERAPY PROGRAMS IN RARE, NEUROLOGIC LYSOSOMAL DISORDERS (\"LDS\"), SPECIFICALLY: CLN6, CLN3, AND CLN8 BATTEN DISEASE, POMPE DISEASE, FABRY DISEASE, CDKL5 DEFICIENCY DISORDER (\"CDD\"), NIEMANN-PICK TYPE C (\u201cNPC\u201d), MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIB (\"MPSIIIB\"), AS WELL AS A NEXT GENERATION PROGRAM IN MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIA (\"MPSIIIA\"). THIS EXPANDED COLLABORATION WITH PENN ALSO PROVIDES US WITH EXCLUSIVE DISEASE-SPECIFIC ACCESS AND THE OPTION RIGHTS TO DEVELOP POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE NEW GENE THERAPY PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES AND PROGRAMS FOR MOST LDS AND A BROADER PORTFOLIO OF RARE DISEASES, INCLUDING RETT SYNDROME, ANGELMAN SYNDROME, MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY, AND SELECT OTHER MUSCULAR DYSTROPHIES.  OUR STRATEGY  OUR STRATEGY IS TO CREATE, MANUFACTURE, TEST, AND DELIVER THE HIGHEST QUALITY MEDICINES FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH RARE METABOLIC DISEASES THROUGH INTERNALLY DEVELOPED, ACQUIRED, OR IN-LICENSED PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO OBSOLETE CURRENT TREATMENTS, PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO PATIENTS, AND BE FIRST- OR BEST-IN-CLASS. IN ADDITION TO OUR PROGRAMS IN FABRY AND POMPE, WE HAVE BEGUN TO LEVERAGE OUR GLOBAL CAPABILITIES TO DEVELOP AND EXPAND OUR ROBUST PIPELINE THROUGH OUR RECENT ENTRY INTO GENOMIC MEDICINE. WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARD FULFILLING OUR VISION TO BUILD A LEADING GLOBAL BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY FOCUSED ON RARE METABOLIC DISEASES.  HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR PROGRESS IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF  2019  INCLUDE.  \u2022  COMMERCIAL AND REGULATORY SUCCESS IN FABRY DISEASE  . DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , GALAFOLD  \u00ae  REVENUE TOTALED  $126.9 MILLION  ,  AN  INCREASE  OF  $68.3 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. WE CONTINUE TO SEE STRONG MOMENTUM THROUGHOUT ALL OF OUR MARKETS AND CONTINUE TO EXPAND INTO ADDITIONAL GEOGRAPHIES. IN THE COUNTRIES WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING THE LONGEST, SUCH AS GERMANY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, WE SEE AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF PREVIOUSLY UNTREATED PATIENTS COME ONTO GALAFOLD  \u00ae  . IN THE U.S., WE CONTINUE TO SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PATIENTS FROM A GROWING AND VERY WIDE PRESCRIBER BASE. ACROSS ALL MARKETS, WE SEE A HIGH RATE OF COMPLIANCE AND ADHERENCE TO THIS ORAL TREATMENT OPTION.  \u2022  POMPE CLINICAL PROGRAM MILESTONES  . WE REPORTED POSITIVE DATA FROM A PHASE 1/2 CLINICAL STUDY TO EVALUATE POMPE DISEASE PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR NOVEL TREATMENT PARADIGM AT-GAA. THE U.S. FDA ALSO GRANTED BREAKTHROUGH THERAPY DESIGNATION FOR AT-GAA FOR THE TREATMENT OF LATE-ONSET POMPE DISEASE. WE ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLING A GLOBAL PIVOTAL STUDY OF AT-GAA (ATB200-03, ALSO KNOWN AS PROPEL) WHICH IS ON TRACK TO ENROLL APPROXIMATELY 100 PARTICIPANTS WITH LATE-ONSET POMPE DISEASE AT UP TO 90 GLOBAL SITES.  \u2022  PIPELINE GROWTH.  WITH OUR RECENT GENE THERAPY PROGRAM EXPANSION, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN INDUSTRY LEADING GENE THERAPY PORTFOLIO OF MEDICINES FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH RARE METABOLIC DISEASES. THROUGH OUR LICENSE WITH NCH, WE ACQUIRED WORLDWIDE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIAL RIGHTS FOR TEN GENE THERAPY PROGRAMS IN RARE, NEUROLOGIC LDS WITH PROGRAMS IN CLN6, CLN3, AND CLN8 BATTEN DISEASE. ADDITIONALLY, FOUR PROGRAMS WERE ADDED TO THE PIPELINE THROUGH ONGOING COLLABORATIONS  WITH PENN TO PURSUE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL GENE THERAPIES FOR POMPE DISEASE, FABRY DISEASE, CDD, NPC, MPSIIIB, AS WELL AS A NEXT GENERATION PROGRAM IN MPSIIIA.  24  \u2022  MANUFACTURING  . WE SUCCESSFULLY SCALED UP MANUFACTURING OF OUR POMPE BIOLOGIC TO COMMERCIAL SCALE (1,000L) FOR OUR PIVOTAL PROPEL STUDY AND COMMERCIAL SUPPLY. OUR SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH WUXI BIOLOGICS AND CURRENT CAPACITY ARE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES TO SUPPORT COMMERCIAL NEEDS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AFTER RECEIPT OF APPLICABLE REGULATORY APPROVALS. FOR GENE THERAPY, WE HAVE RECENTLY ENTERED INTO STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WITH TWO BEST-IN-CLASS CONTRACT DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATIONS: CATALENT BIOLOGICS AND THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC. CATALENT BIOLOGICS WILL SUPPORT OUR CLINICAL MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES AND CAPACITY FOR MULTIPLE ACTIVE PRECLINICAL LYSOSOMAL DISORDER PROGRAMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT IN COLLABORATION WITH PENN. THERMO FISHER WILL ASSIST WITH LATE-STAGE CLINICAL AND COMMERCIAL-SCALE CAPABILITIES AND PROVIDES US WITH IMMEDIATE CLINICAL AND COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES AND CAPACITY FOR THE AMICUS INTRATHECAL AAV BATTEN DISEASE GENE THERAPY PROGRAMS.  \u2022  FINANCIAL STRENGTH.  TOTAL CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF  $514.2 MILLION  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  COMPARED TO  $504.2 MILLION  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THE CURRENT CASH POSITION, INCLUDING EXPECTED GALAFOLD  \u00ae  REVENUES, IS SUFFICIENT TO FUND ONGOING FABRY, POMPE, AND GENE THERAPY PROGRAM OPERATIONS  INTO THE FIRST HALF OF 2022  . POTENTIAL FUTURE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATIONS, PIPELINE EXPANSION, AND INVESTMENT IN MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES COULD IMPACT OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  OUR COMMERCIAL PRODUCT AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES  GALAFOLD  \u00ae  (MIGALASTAT HCL) FOR FABRY DISEASE  OUR ORAL PRECISION MEDICINE GALAFOLD  \u00ae  WAS GRANTED ACCELERATED APPROVAL BY THE FDA IN AUGUST 2018 UNDER THE BRAND NAME GALAFOLD  \u00ae  FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADULTS WITH A CONFIRMED DIAGNOSIS OF FABRY DISEASE AND AN AMENABLE GALACTOSIDASE ALPHA GENE (\"GLA\") VARIANT BASED ON IN VITRO ASSAY DATA. THE FDA APPROVED GALAFOLD  \u00ae  FOR 348 AMENABLE GLA VARIANTS. GALAFOLD  \u00ae  WAS APPROVED IN THE E.U. IN MAY 2016 AS A FIRST-LINE THERAPY FOR LONG-TERM TREATMENT OF ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS, AGED 16 YEARS AND OLDER, WITH A CONFIRMED DIAGNOSIS OF FABRY DISEASE AND WHO HAVE AN AMENABLE VARIANT. THE APPROVED E.U. LABEL INCLUDES 367 FABRY-CAUSING VARIANTS, WHICH REPRESENT UP TO HALF OF ALL PATIENTS WITH FABRY DISEASE. APPROVALS HAVE ALSO BEEN GRANTED IN JAPAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, WITH ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS PENDING. WE HAVE BEEN GRANTED PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT IN 27 COUNTRIES. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO LAUNCH GALAFOLD  \u00ae  IN ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES DURING  2019.  AS AN ORALLY ADMINISTERED MONOTHERAPY, GALAFOLD  \u00ae  IS DESIGNED TO BIND TO AND STABILIZE AN ENDOGENOUS ALPHA-GALACTOSIDASE A (\"ALPHA-GAL A\") ENZYME IN THOSE PATIENTS WITH GENETIC VARIANTS IDENTIFIED AS AMENABLE IN A GLP CELL-BASED AMENABILITY ASSAY. GALAFOLD  \u00ae  IS AN ORAL PRECISION MEDICINE INTENDED TO TREAT FABRY DISEASE IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE AMENABLE GENETIC VARIANTS AND, AT THIS TIME, IT IS NOT INTENDED FOR CONCOMITANT USE WITH ERT.  GENE THERAPY FOR FABRY DISEASE  WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUED INNOVATION FOR ALL PEOPLE LIVING WITH FABRY DISEASE. FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH FABRY DISEASE WHO HAVE NON-AMENABLE VARIANTS, WHICH ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR GALAFOLD  \u00ae  AS A MONOTHERAPY, OUR STRATEGY IS TO DEVELOP A FABRY GENE THERAPY. IN OCTOBER 2018, WE FURTHER EXPANDED OUR GENE THERAPY PORTFOLIO THROUGH A COLLABORATION AGREEMENT WITH PENN TO PURSUE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL GENE THERAPIES FOR FABRY DISEASE.  NOVEL ERT FOR POMPE DISEASE  WE ARE LEVERAGING OUR BIOLOGICS CAPABILITIES TO DEVELOP AT-GAA, A NOVEL TREATMENT PARADIGM FOR POMPE DISEASE. AT-GAA CONSISTS OF A UNIQUELY ENGINEERED RHGAA ENZYME, ATB200, WITH AN OPTIMIZED CARBOHYDRATE STRUCTURE TO ENHANCE LYSOSOMAL UPTAKE, ADMINISTERED IN COMBINATION WITH A PHARMACOLOGICAL CHAPERONE, AT2221, TO IMPROVE ACTIVITY AND STABILITY. WE INITIATED A GLOBAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL STUDY (\"ATB200-03\", OR \"PROPEL\") OF AT-GAA IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH LATE ONSET POMPE DISEASE IN 2018, WITH THE FIRST PATIENT DOSED IN DECEMBER 2018.  THE PHARMACOLOGICAL CHAPERONE, AT2221 IS NOT AN ACTIVE INGREDIENT THAT CONTRIBUTES DIRECTLY TO GAA SUBSTRATE REDUCTION BUT INSTEAD ACTS TO STABILIZE ATB200. THE SMALL MOLECULE PHARMACOLOGICAL CHAPERONE AT2221 BINDS AND STABILIZES ATB200 TO IMPROVE THE UPTAKE OF ACTIVE ENZYME IN KEY DISEASE-RELEVANT TISSUES, RESULTING IN INCREASED CLEARANCE OF ACCUMULATED SUBSTRATE, GLYCOGEN.  OUR STRATEGY IS TO ENHANCE THE BODY OF CLINICAL DATA FOR AT-GAA IN ONGOING CLINICAL STUDIES. THE PROPEL PIVOTAL STUDY DELIVERS THIS POTENTIAL NEW THERAPY TO AS MANY PEOPLE LIVING WITH LATE ONSET POMPE DISEASE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. BASED ON REGULATORY FEEDBACK FROM BOTH THE U.S. FDA AND THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY (\"EMA\"), THE PROPEL STUDY IS EXPECTED TO SUPPORT APPROVAL FOR A BROAD INDICATION, INCLUDING ERT-SWITCH AND TREATMENT-NAI\u0308VE PATIENTS, IF THE RESULTS ARE FAVORABLE.  25  IN OCTOBER 2019, WE REPORTED ADDITIONAL INTERIM DATA FROM OUR CLINICAL STUDY ATB200-02 AT THE 24TH INTERNATIONAL ANNUAL CONGRESS OF THE WORLD MUSCLE SOCIETY. HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDED MUSCLE FUNCTION, SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY DATA IN PATIENTS AS WELL AS PHARMACODYNAMIC DATA (MUSCLE DAMAGE BIOMARKER, CREATINE KINASE, AND DISEASE SUBSTRATE BIOMARKER, URINE HEXOSE TETRASACCHARIDE). MUSCLE FUNCTION IMPROVED IN 16 OUT OF 18 PATIENTS AT 24 MONTHS. MEAN SIX-MINUTE WALK TEST (\"6MWT\") IMPROVED IN BOTH ERT-NAI\u0308VE AND ERT-SWITCH PATIENTS WITH CONTINUED BENEFIT OBSERVED OUT TO MONTH 24. ALL 5 ERT-NAIVE PATIENTS SHOWED INCREASES FROM BASELINE IN 6MWT DISTANCE AT ALL TIME POINTS OUT TO MONTH 24. TO DATE, ADVERSE EVENTS HAVE BEEN GENERALLY MILD AND TRANSIENT. AT-GAA HAS RESULTED IN A LOW RATE OF INFUSION-ASSOCIATED REACTIONS (\"IARS\") FOLLOWING OVER 1,500+ INFUSIONS (28 EVENTS OF IARS IN EIGHT PATIENTS). THE CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETIC PROFILE HAS BEEN CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PRECLINICAL DATA. TREATMENT WITH AT-GAA RESULTED IN PERSISTENT AND DURABLE REDUCTIONS IN CREATINE KINASE AND URINE HEXOSE TETRASACCHARIDE ACROSS ALL PATIENT COHORTS UP TO MONTH 24.  GENE THERAPY FOR POMPE DISEASE  AS PART OF OUR LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT UNMET NEEDS OF THE POMPE COMMUNITY, WE ARE ALSO ADVANCING A NEXT-GENERATION GENE THERAPY TREATMENT FOR POMPE DISEASE. IN OCTOBER 2018, WE FURTHER EXPANDED OUR GENE THERAPY PORTFOLIO THROUGH A COLLABORATION AGREEMENT WITH PENN TO PURSUE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL GENE THERAPIES FOR, AMONG OTHER INDICATIONS, POMPE DISEASE.  IN APRIL 2019, WE PRESENTED INITIAL PRECLINICAL DATA FROM OUR INVESTIGATIONAL ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRAL (\"AAV\") GENE THERAPY PROGRAM FOR POMPE DISEASE. THIS INITIAL PRECLINICAL STUDY IN POMPE KNOCKOUT MICE ADMINISTERED A SINGLE HIGH DOSE OF AAV GENE THERAPY WITH EITHER UNMODIFIED WILD-TYPE HGAA (\"UNMODIFIED HGAA\") OR AN AMICUS/PENN ENGINEERED HGAA TRANSGENE WITH A LYSOSOMAL-TARGETING CELL RECEPTOR BINDING MOTIF (\"ENGINEERED HGAA\"). THE AMICUS/PENN ENGINEERED HGAA AAV GENE THERAPY DEMONSTRATED MORE UNIFORM CELLULAR UPTAKE AND LYSOSOMAL TARGETING COMPARED TO UNMODIFIED HGAA AAV GENE THERAPY, AS WELL AS, ROBUST GLYCOGEN REDUCTION IN ALL KEY TISSUES IN POMPE DISEASE THAT WERE ASSESSED. IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, THE ENGINEERED HGAA AAV GENE THERAPY SHOWED ROBUST GLYCOGEN REDUCTION IN NEURONAL CELLS, SUGGESTING THIS MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO ADDRESS NEURONAL ASPECTS OF POMPE DISEASE. UNMODIFIED HGAA AAV GENE THERAPY SHOWED MINIMAL GLYCOGEN REDUCTION IN NEURONAL CELLS. THIS PRECLINICAL STUDY PROVIDES INITIAL VALIDATION FOR COMBINING AMICUS-ENGINEERED TRANSGENES WITH PENN'S AAV GENE THERAPY TECHNOLOGIES.  BATTEN DISEASE PRODUCT CANDIDATES  WE ARE RESEARCHING POTENTIAL FIRST-IN-CLASS GENE THERAPIES FOR MULTIPLE FORMS OF BATTEN DISEASE. BATTEN DISEASE IS THE COMMON NAME FOR A BROAD CLASS OF RARE, FATAL, INHERITED DISORDERS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM ALSO KNOWN AS NEURONAL CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSES, OR NCLS. IN THESE DISEASES, A DEFECT IN A SPECIFIC GENE TRIGGERS A CASCADE OF PROBLEMS THAT INTERFERES WITH A CELL'S ABILITY TO RECYCLE CERTAIN MOLECULES. EACH GENE IS CALLED CLN (CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL) AND GIVEN A DIFFERENT NUMBER DESIGNATION AS ITS SUBTYPE. THERE ARE 13 KNOWN FORMS OF BATTEN DISEASE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS CLN1-8; 10-14. THE VARIOUS TYPES OF BATTEN DISEASE HAVE SIMILAR FEATURES AND SYMPTOMS BUT VARY IN SEVERITY AND AGE OF ONSET.  THE TWO CLINICAL STAGE GENE THERAPIES ARE IN CLN3 AND CLN6 BATTEN DISEASE. THE CLN6 BATTEN DISEASE PHASE 1/2 STUDY COMPLETED TARGET ENROLLMENT, WITH TWELVE PATIENTS RECEIVING A SINGLE ADMINISTRATION OF ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRUS SEROTYPE 9 AAV-CLN6 GENE THERAPY. IN AUGUST 2019, WE REPORTED POSITIVE INTERIM CLINICAL DATA FROM THE FIRST EIGHT PATIENTS IN THE STUDY. THE AAV-CLN6 GENE THERAPY DEMONSTRATED A POSITIVE IMPACT ON MOTOR AND LANGUAGE FUNCTION. SEVEN OUT OF EIGHT PATIENTS MAINTAINED STABLE HAMBURG MOTOR AND LANGUAGE SCORES OR HAD AN INITIAL CHANGE (+1 TO -1 POINTS) FOLLOWED BY STABILIZATION. IN OCTOBER 2019, WE REPORTED ADDITIONAL INTERIM CLINICAL DATA FURTHER SUPPORTING THE IMPACT OF ONE-TIME INTRATHECAL AAV GENE THERAPY IN CHILDREN WITH CLN6 BATTEN DISEASE.  THIS INTERIM DATA SUGGESTED STABILIZATION OF VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE HAMBURG MOTOR, LANGUAGE, SEIZURE AND VISION SCORES IN MOST PATIENTS FROM BASELINE TO MONTH 12 OR 24, IN PARTICULAR THOSE PATIENTS TREATED AT A YOUNGER AGE.  IN THE CLN3 BATTEN DISEASE STUDY, A TOTAL OF THREE PATIENTS WERE DOSED IN THE LOW DOSE GROUP WITH NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AFTER UP TO 5 MONTHS FOLLOWING A SINGLE ADMINISTRATION OF AAV-CLN3 GENE THERAPY. BASED ON THE SAFETY PROFILE TO DATE, THE DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD CLEARED AMICUS TO BEGIN ENROLLMENT IN THE HIGH DOSE COHORT OF UP TO THREE ADDITIONAL PATIENTS.  26  CDKL5 DEFICIENCY DISORDER  WE ARE RESEARCHING A POTENTIAL FIRST-IN-CLASS PROTEIN REPLACEMENT THERAPY APPROACH FOR CDD. IN ADDITION, THROUGH OUR COLLABORATION WITH PENN, WE ARE RESEARCHING A GENE THERAPY FOR CDD. CDKL5 IS A GENE ON THE X-CHROMOSOME ENCODING THE CDKL5 PROTEIN THAT REGULATES THE EXPRESSION OF SEVERAL ESSENTIAL PROTEINS FOR NORMAL BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. GENETIC MUTATIONS IN THE CDKL5 GENE RESULT IN CDKL5 PROTEIN DEFICIENCY AND CDD. THIS DISORDER MANIFESTS CLINICALLY AS PERSISTENT SEIZURES STARTING IN INFANCY, FOLLOWED BY SEVERE IMPAIRMENT IN NEUROLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT. MOST CHILDREN AFFECTED BY CDD CANNOT WALK OR CARE FOR THEMSELVES AND MAY ALSO SUFFER FROM SCOLIOSIS, VISUAL IMPAIRMENT, SENSORY ISSUES, AND GASTROINTESTINAL COMPLICATIONS.  STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND ARRANGEMENTS  WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AS APPROPRIATE THAT BUILD STOCKHOLDER VALUE AND PROVIDE US WITH ACCESS TO THE FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL, CLINICAL, AND COMMERCIAL RESOURCES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP AND MARKET TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS WITH A FOCUS ON RARE METABOLIC DISEASES. WE ARE EXPLORING POTENTIAL COLLABORATIONS, ALLIANCES, AND OTHER BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES ON A REGULAR BASIS. THESE OPPORTUNITIES MAY INCLUDE THE ACQUISITION OF PRECLINICAL-STAGE, CLINICAL-STAGE, OR MARKETED PRODUCTS SO LONG AS SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR STRATEGIC PLAN TO DEVELOP AND PROVIDE THERAPIES TO PATIENTS LIVING WITH RARE AND ORPHAN DISEASES.  27  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  COMPARED TO  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE COMPANY.

SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY  DURING THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE ENTERED INTO SEPARATE, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS WITH A LIMITED NUMBER OF HOLDERS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS, THE LIMITED NUMBER OF HOLDERS AGREED TO EXCHANGE AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $247.2 MILLION  OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES HELD BY THEM IN EXCHANGE FOR AN AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY  44.0 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE  $0.01  PER SHARE. ADDITIONALLY, WE TERMINATED THE CAPPED CALL CONFIRMATIONS RELATED TO THE EXCHANGE OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES FOR CASH PROCEEDS OF  $19.9 MILLION.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE COMPLETED AN UNDERWRITTEN EQUITY OFFERING AND ISSUED  18.7 MILLION  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT  $10.75  PER SHARE, INCLUSIVE OF THE FULLY EXERCISED OPTION TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHARES FROM THE INITIAL OFFERING. THIS TRANSACTION RESULTED IN NET PROCEEDS OF  $189.0 MILLION  , AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS, COMMISSIONS AND OFFERING EXPENSES.  CASH FLOW DISCUSSION  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF  $514.2  MILLION. WE INVEST CASH IN EXCESS OF OUR IMMEDIATE REQUIREMENTS IN REGARD TO LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL PRESERVATION IN A VARIETY OF INTEREST-BEARING INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS. WHEREVER POSSIBLE, WE SEEK TO MINIMIZE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CONCENTRATION AND DEGREES OF RISK.

THIS AGREEMENT EXPIRED UPON EXPIRATION OF THE LAST OF THE LICENSED PATENT RIGHTS, WHICH OCCURRED IN 2018 IN THE U.S. AND 2019 IN EUROPE AND JAPAN FOR MONOTHERAPY.  GSK  - IN NOVEMBER 2013, WE ENTERED INTO THE REVISED AGREEMENT (THE \"REVISED AGREEMENT\") WITH GLAXOSMITHKLINE (\"GSK\"), PURSUANT TO WHICH WE HAVE OBTAINED GLOBAL RIGHTS TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE MIGALASTAT AS A MONOTHERAPY AND IN COMBINATION WITH ERT FOR FABRY DISEASE.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH WE HAVE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS THE REPORTED REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED IN GREATER DETAIL BELOW. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  TO THE ITEMS THAT WE DISCLOSED AS OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED IN \"\u2014NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\" TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS CONTAINED IN THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, EXCEPT AS IT RELATES TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-02, LEASES (TOPIC 842), WHICH IS DESCRIBED BELOW.  LEASES  THE COMPANY PRIMARILY ENTERS INTO LEASE AGREEMENTS FOR OFFICE SPACE, EQUIPMENT, AND VEHICLES. THE LEASES HAVE VARYING TERMS, SOME OF WHICH COULD INCLUDE OPTIONS TO RENEW, EXTEND, AND EARLY TERMINATE. THE COMPANY DETERMINES IF AN ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE AT CONTRACT INCEPTION. OPERATING LEASES ARE INCLUDED IN RIGHT-OF-USE (\"ROU\") ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  ROU ASSETS REPRESENT THE COMPANY'S RIGHT TO CONTROL THE USE OF AN EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY IDENTIFIED FIXED ASSET FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND LEASE LIABILITIES REPRESENT THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATION TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS ARISING FROM THE LEASE. CONTROL OF AN UNDERLYING ASSET IS CONVEYED TO THE COMPANY IF THE COMPANY OBTAINS THE RIGHTS TO DIRECT THE USE OF AND TO OBTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM USING THE UNDERLYING ASSET. ROU ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED AT COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. THE COMPANY USES ITS INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT COMMENCEMENT DATE IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS.  LEASE PAYMENTS INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LEASE LIABILITY ARE COMPRISED OF FIXED PAYMENTS.  VARIABLE LEASE PAYMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ROU ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE OBLIGATION FOR THOSE PAYMENTS IS INCURRED. VARIABLE LEASE PAYMENTS ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE SAME LINE ITEM AS EXPENSES ARISING FROM FIXED LEASE PAYMENTS FOR OPERATING LEASES. THE COMPANY HAS LEASE AGREEMENTS THAT INCLUDE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, WHICH THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR AS A SINGLE LEASE COMPONENT FOR ALL UNDERLYING ASSET CATEGORIES.  THE LEASE TERM FOR ALL OF THE COMPANY'S LEASES INCLUDE THE NON-CANCELLABLE PERIOD OF THE LEASE PLUS ANY ADDITIONAL PERIODS COVERED BY EITHER A COMPANY OPTION TO EXTEND (OR NOT TO TERMINATE) THE LEASE THAT THE COMPANY IS REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE, OR AN OPTION TO EXTEND (OR NOT TO TERMINATE) THE LEASE CONTROLLED BY THE LESSOR.  34  LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES LEASE EXPENSE FOR THESE LEASES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  THE COMPANY APPLIES THIS POLICY TO ALL UNDERLYING ASSET CATEGORIES.

THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: (1) CHANGES IN PREVAILING INTEREST RATES WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE INTEREST EARNED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S INTEREST EARNING ASSETS AND THE INTEREST PAID ON ITS INTEREST BEARING LIABILITIES; (2) THE TIMING OF REPRICING OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INTEREST EARNING ASSETS AND INTEREST BEARING LIABILITIES; (3) THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL MONETARY POLICY; (4) THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY AND THE BANK AND THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESS; (5) CHANGES IN COMPETITION AMONG FINANCIAL SERVICE COMPANIES, INCLUDING POSSIBLE FURTHER ENCROACHMENT OF NON-BANKS ON SERVICES TRADITIONALLY PROVIDED BY BANKS; (6) THE ABILITY OF COMPETITORS THAT ARE LARGER THAN THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WHICH IT IS IMPRACTICABLE FOR THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE; (7) THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY AND REAL ESTATE VALUES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S MARKET AREAS, AND THE CONSEQUENT EFFECT ON THE QUALITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LOANS; (8) RECENT GOVERNMENTAL INITIATIVES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY AND COULD DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT OF THE COMPANY; (9) OTHER LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY CHANGES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, AND FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (\u201cFDIC\u201d) PREMIUMS THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY; (10) THE APPLICATION OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, CONSISTENTLY APPLIED; (11) THE FACT THAT ONE PERIOD OF REPORTED RESULTS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE PERIODS; (12) THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY IN THE GREATER NEW YORK METROPOLITAN AREA AND ITS PARTICULAR EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS, VENDORS AND COMMUNITIES; AND (13) OTHER SUCH FACTORS, INCLUDING RISK FACTORS, AS MAY BE DESCRIBED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SEC. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FILED WITH THE SEC ON APRIL 1, 2019 (THE \u201c2018 FORM 10-K\u201d) AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q.  ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT OFFERS THE LOAN AND DEPOSIT PRODUCTS AND HAS THE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR CONTINUED SUCCESS, FUTURE REVENUES AND INTEREST SPREADS AND YIELDS CANNOT BE RELIABLY PREDICTED. THESE TRENDS MAY CAUSE THE COMPANY TO ADJUST ITS OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE OF THE FOREGOING AND OTHER FACTORS, RECENT TRENDS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED RELIABLE INDICATORS OF FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS OR STOCK PRICES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND TO DISCLOSE CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. MANAGEMENT HAS IDENTIFIED THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES, THE ANALYSIS AND VALUATION OF ITS INVESTMENT SECURITIES, THE VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND THE VALUATION OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH ITS BUSINESS COMBINATION, AS THE COMPANY\u2019S MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES IN THAT THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT\u2019S MOST SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENT AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. REFER TO THE 2018 FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  44  SUMMARY  THE COMPANY REPORTED NET INCOME FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 OF $27,000 ($0.01 BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) COMPARED TO A NET INCOME OF $769,000 ($0.20 BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. THE INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $35,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO $1.0 MILLION INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $1.3 MILLION ($0.33 BASIC AND DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE) COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF $2.9 MILLION ($0.74 BASIC AND $0.73 DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, A DECREASE OF $4.2 MILLION. THE DECLINE IN 2019 RESULTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A MATERIAL INCREASE IN PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES TO $2.9 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND $3.2 MILLION IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH A $2.3 MILLION CHARGE-OFF ON A SINGLE COMMERCIAL LOAN.  THE RESULTS OF THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE ALSO IMPACTED BY A DECLINE IN NET INTEREST INCOME DUE TO HIGHER RETAIL DEPOSIT COSTS, A HIGHER BALANCE OF NON-ACCRUAL LOANS AND THE FULL YEAR IMPACT OF SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED IN JUNE 2018. THE COMPARISON TO THE PRIOR YEAR WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY AN INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES. THE EXPENSE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUILD-UP OF OUR SBA BUSINESS, EXPANSION OF DEPOSIT INITIATIVES, AND COSTS INCURRED IN CONJUNCTION WITH ENHANCING PROCESSES, CONTROLS AND DOCUMENTATION IN RESPONSE TO THE FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE OCC.  AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON MARCH 30, 2019, THE COMPANY AND HANA SMALL BUSINESS LENDING INC. MUTUALLY AGREED TO TERMINATE THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES ENTERED INTO IN NOVEMBER 2018. THE TERMINATION AGREEMENT PROVIDED FOR THE RELEASE OF ESCROWED FUNDS BACK TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY RECEIVED THE ESCROWED FUNDS OF $500,000 ON MAY 9, 2019.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS OPERATING RESULTS TO BUILD BACK UP IN FUTURE PERIODS AS IT BEGINS TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS IN NET INTEREST AND NON-INTEREST INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH ITS INVESTMENTS IN THE EXPANSION OF ITS SBA BUSINESS AND DEPOSIT RAISING INITIATIVES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE OCC AND INTENDS TO FULLY RESOLVE ALL MATTERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OCC FORMAL AGREEMENT TO THE FULL SATISFACTION OF THE OCC.  FINANCIAL CONDITION  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, TOTAL ASSETS INCREASED TO $972.0 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO $951.7 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. NET LOAN PORTFOLIO INCREASED $19.1 MILLION OR 2.5% FROM $772.8 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $791.9 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. DEPOSITS INCREASED TO $762.1MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO $743.3 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018.  EQUITY DECREASED $1.1 MILLION OR 1.6%, FROM $69.3 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $68.2 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO $1.3 MILLION OF NET LOSS AND $116,000 OF COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $109,000 OF INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO UNREALIZED GAIN AND $162,000 OF EQUITY COMPENSATION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED $16.4 MILLION, FROM $66.4 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $50.0 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THE DECREASE IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $28.2 MILLION CASH USED FOR LOAN PURCHASES, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $18.8 MILLION CASH INCREASE IN DEPOSITS. THE COMPANY\u2019S LIQUIDITY POSITION REMAINS STRONG WITH LIQUID ASSETS 10.3% OF TOTAL ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  45  INVESTMENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE IS A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, AT FAIR VALUE, AT THE DATES SHOWN.

THE INCREASE IN LOANS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $28.2 MILLION IN PURCHASES OF LOANS RECEIVABLE IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE LOAN PIPELINE IS STRONG. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ADD TO THE PRODUCT LINES AND ENHANCE SERVICE OFFERINGS TO CUSTOMERS.  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE NET LOAN TO DEPOSIT RATIO WAS 104% AND THE NET LOAN TO TOTAL ASSETS RATIO WAS 81%. AT DECEMBER 31, 2018, THESE RATIOS WERE 104% AND 81%, RESPECTIVELY.  46  ALLOWANCE FOR  L  OAN AND  L  EASE  L  OSSES  THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES INCREASED $800,000 OR 10.5% FROM $7.6 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $8.4 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $3.2 MILLION IN PROVISION FOR ALL LOAN CATEGORIES, WHICH WAS OFFSET BY $2.4 MILLION NET CHARGE-OFFS OF LOANS.  BASED UPON THE OVERALL ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES $8.4 MILLION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES, WHICH REPRESENTED 1.05% OF GROSS LOANS OUTSTANDING, IS ADEQUATE UNDER PREVAILING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS TO ABSORB EXISTING LOSSES IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO.  THE INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SINGLE LOAN CHARGE-OFF OF $2.3 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND ITS RELATED IMPACT ON THE HISTORICAL LOSS RATE OF THE CORRESPONDING FEDERAL CALL CODE SEGMENT.  THE $2.3 MILLION LOAN CHARGE-OFF RELATED TO A COMMERCIAL LOAN CHARGED-OFF DUE TO THE INABILITY OF THE BORROWER TO DEMONSTRATE THE OPERATING CASH FLOW NECESSARY TO FUND INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL ON THE LOAN COMBINED WITH INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION REGARDING COLLATERAL, LEADING THE BANK TO DETERMINE THAT FULL COLLECTION IS DOUBTFUL.

TWO TDR LOANS OF TOTAL $9.3 MILLION WERE INCLUDED IN THE NON-ACCRUAL LOANS. THE COMPANY HAS OBTAINED APPRAISAL REPORTS FROM INDEPENDENT LICENSED APPRAISAL FIRMS AND DISCOUNTED THOSE VALUES FOR ESTIMATED SELLING COSTS TO DETERMINE ESTIMATED IMPAIRMENT. THE BANK EVALUATED THE IMPAIRED LOANS INDIVIDUALLY AND DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO RESULTING SPECIFIC RESERVE FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE $19.2 MILLION OF NON-ACCRUAL LOANS WAS COMPRISED OF 23 BORROWERS, FOR WHICH A SPECIFIC RESERVE OF $1.5 MILLION HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED. THERE WERE NO TDR LOANS INCLUDED IN THE NON-ACCRUAL LOANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018.  48  DEFERRED TAXES  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS INCREASED $600,000, FROM $10.9 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $11.5 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THE INCREASE IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE IMPACT OF NET LOSS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS 23% AND 26%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 26% AND 26% FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE CHANGE IN THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE RATES FOR BOTH PERIODS RESULTED FROM HAVING NO STATE INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE THIRD QUARTER DUE TO CERTAIN PERMANENT DIFFERENCE AND THE VERY SMALL PRE-TAX INCOME AMOUNT.

TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $4.9 MILLION OR 57.5% AS COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE OF $4.3 MILLION IN DEPOSIT INTERESTS DUE TO HIGHER DEPOSIT RATES AND AN INCREASE OF $356,000 IN SUBORDINATED DEBT INTEREST.

HIGHER RETAIL DEPOSIT RATES ARE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF INCREASED RATE COMPETITION IN PATRIOT\u2019S LOCAL RETAIL MARKETS.

THE INCREASE IN BOTH THE YEAR TO DATE AND QUARTER COMPARISONS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GAIN ON SALE OF SBA LOANS OF $188,000 AND $864,000 IN THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  NON-INTEREST EXPENSE  NON-INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $632,000 FROM $6.0 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 TO $6.7 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASE OF $686,000 IN SALARIES AND BENEFITS.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, NON-INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $2.1 MILLION TO $19.9 MILLION, FROM $17.8 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES OF $1.9 MILLION IN SALARIES AND BENEFITS, $639,000 IN PROFESSIONAL AND OTHER OUTSIDE SERVICES, AND $432,000 IN OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. DUE TO CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THE BANK\u2019S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTION OF $1.5 MILLION IN NON-RECURRING PROJECT EXPENSES.  THE INCREASE IN SALARIES AND BENEFITS REFLECTS THE BUILD-UP OF THE SBA TEAM, ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRIME ACQUISITION, AND INCREASED HEADCOUNT SUPPORTING NEW DEPOSIT INITIATIVES AND EXPANSION OF CREDIT, FINANCE AND COMPLIANCE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS.  THE INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL AND OUTSIDE SERVICE FEES INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF COSTS INCURRED WITH SBA ORIGINATION AND SALE ACTIVITIES AND ADDITIONAL EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPANSION OF DEPOSIT RAISING INITIATIVES AND RESOLUTION OF DOCUMENTATION AND POLICY MATTERS ASSOCIATED WITH RESOLUTION OF THE OCC FORMAL AGREEMENT.  PROVISION  (BENEFIT)  FOR INCOME TAXES  THE COMPANY REPORTED PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OF $8,000 AND BENEFIT FOR INCOME TAXES OF $456,000 FOR THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OF $276,000 AND $1.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE MAINLY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE NET LOSS IN 2019.  LIQUIDITY  THE COMPANY\u2019S BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY TO TOTAL ASSETS RATIO WAS 10.3% AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO 10.7% AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. LIQUIDITY INCLUDING READILY AVAILABLE OFF BALANCE SHEET FUNDING SOURCES WAS 18.5% AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO 19.4% AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE COMPANY\u2019S AVAILABLE TOTAL LIQUIDITY (READILY AVAILABLE PLUS BROKERED DEPOSIT AVAILABILITY) TO TOTAL ASSETS RATIO WAS 21.7% AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO 23.7% AT DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES OF ASSETS ARE CONSIDERED BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY: CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS, FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD (IF ANY), SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS (IF ANY) AND UNPLEDGED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. IN ADDITION, OFF BALANCE SHEET FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDE COLLATERAL BASED BORROWING AVAILABLE FROM THE FHLB, CORRESPONDENT BANK BORROWING LINES, AND BROKERED DEPOSITS SUBJECT TO INTERNAL LIMITATIONS.  LIQUIDITY IS A MEASURE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO GENERATE ADEQUATE CASH TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL CASH REQUIREMENTS OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION ARE TO COVER DOWNWARD FLUCTUATIONS IN DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY\u2019S LIQUID ASSETS PROVIDE SUFFICIENT COVERAGE TO SATISFY LOAN DEMAND, COVER POTENTIAL FLUCTUATIONS IN DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS, AND TO MEET OTHER ANTICIPATED OPERATIONAL CASH REQUIREMENTS.  56  CAPITAL  THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE COMPANY\u2019S AND THE BANK\u2019S REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018.

UNDER THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTION ACTION, TO BE CONSIDERED \u201cWELL CAPITALIZED,\u201d AN INSTITUTION MUST GENERALLY HAVE A LEVERAGE CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 5.0%, CET1 CAPITAL RATIO AT LEAST 6.5%, A TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 8.0% AND A TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10%. HOWEVER, THE OCC HAS THE DISCRETION TO REQUIRE INCREASED CAPITAL RATIOS.  UNDER THE FINAL CAPITAL RULES THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2015, THERE IS A REQUIREMENT FOR A CET1 CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER OF 2.5% OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, WHICH IS IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL STANDARDS IN THE RULE. INSTITUTIONS THAT DO NOT MAINTAIN THIS REQUIRED CAPITAL BUFFER BECOME SUBJECT TO PROGRESSIVELY MORE STRINGENT LIMITATIONS ON THE PERCENTAGE OF EARNINGS THAT MAY BE DISTRIBUTED TO SHAREHOLDERS OR USED FOR STOCK REPURCHASES AND ON THE PAYMENT OF DISCRETIONARY BONUSES TO SENIOR EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT.  THE CAPITAL BUFFER REQUIREMENT IS BEING PHASED IN OVER THREE YEARS BEGINNING IN 2016. THE 1.875% CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER FOR 2018 HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE MINIMUM CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIOS IN THE 2018 COLUMN IN THE TABLE ABOVE. THE CAPITAL CONVERSATION BUFFER INCREASED TO 2.5% FOR 2019, WHICH HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE MINIMUM CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIOS IN THE 2019 COLUMN ABOVE.  THE CAPITAL BUFFER REQUIREMENT EFFECTIVELY RAISES THE BANK\u2019S MINIMUM REQUIRED TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO TO 10.5%, THE TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO TO 8.5%, AND THE CET1 CAPITAL RATIO TO 7.0% ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS, WHICH WAS EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2019. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, PATRIOT SATISFIES ALL CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE BASEL III CAPITAL RULES ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS.  MANAGEMENT CONTINUOUSLY ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF THE BANK\u2019S CAPITAL WITH THE GOAL TO MAINTAIN A \u201cWELL CAPITALIZED\u201d CLASSIFICATION.  IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES  THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN TERMS OF HISTORICAL DOLLARS, WITHOUT CONSIDERING CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE PURCHASING POWER OF MONEY OVER TIME DUE TO INFLATION. UNLIKE MOST INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES, VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION ARE MONETARY IN NATURE. AS A RESULT, INTEREST RATES HAVE A MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION\u2019S PERFORMANCE THAN THE EFFECT OF GENERAL LEVELS OF INFLATION. INTEREST RATES DO NOT NECESSARILY MOVE IN THE SAME DIRECTION OR WITH THE SAME MAGNITUDE AS THE PRICES OF GOODS AND SERVICES. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS, INFLATION CAN DIRECTLY AFFECT THE VALUE OF LOAN COLLATERAL, IN PARTICULAR, REAL ESTATE. INFLATION, DEFLATION OR DISINFLATION COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

IS A PROVIDER OF ADVANCED IMAGE  ANALYSIS, WORKFLOW SOLUTIONS AND RADIATION THERAPY FOR THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF CANCER. THE COMPANY REPORTS IN TWO SEGMENTS \u2013CANCER DETECTION (\u201cDETECTION\u201d) AND CANCER THERAPY (\u201cTHERAPY\u201d).  IN THE DETECTION SEGMENT, OUR SOLUTIONS INCLUDE (I) ADVANCED IMAGE ANALYSIS AND WORKFLOW SOLUTIONS THAT ENABLE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS TO BETTER SERVE  PATIENTS BY IDENTIFYING PATHOLOGIES AND PINPOINTING THE MOST PREVALENT CANCERS EARLIER, AND (II) A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE, UPGRADEABLE COMPUTER-AIDED DETECTION (CAD) SYSTEMS AND WORKFLOW SOLUTIONS FOR MAMMOGRAPHY, MAGNETIC  RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) AND COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT).  THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE THE EXTENSION OF ITS IMAGE ANALYSIS AND CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT  SOLUTIONS FOR MAMMOGRAPHY AND CT IMAGING. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ADVANCES IN DIGITAL IMAGING TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS 3D MAMMOGRAPHY, SHOULD BOLSTER ITS EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL COMMERCIALLY VIABLE CAD/ADVANCED IMAGE ANALYSIS AND WORKFLOW  PRODUCTS.  IN THE THERAPY SEGMENT, THE COMPANY OFFERS AN ISOTOPE-FREE CANCER TREATMENT PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY THE XOFT ELECTRONIC BRACHYTHERAPY SYSTEM  (\u201cXOFT SYSTEM\u201d). THE XOFT SYSTEM CAN BE USED FOR THE TREATMENT OF EARLY- STAGE BREAST CANCER, ENDOMETRIAL CANCER, CERVICAL CANCER AND SKIN CANCER. WE BELIEVE THE XOFT SYSTEM PLATFORM INDICATIONS REPRESENT STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES IN THE  UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS TO OFFER DIFFERENTIATED TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES. IN ADDITION, THE XOFT SYSTEM GENERATES ADDITIONAL RECURRING REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF CONSUMABLES AND RELATED ACCESSORIES WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE GROWTH IN  THIS SEGMENT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED IN NASHUA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, WITH A MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND AN OPERATIONS,  RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND WAREHOUSING FACILITY IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE COMPANY\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND CASH FLOWS ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  THE  PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ON AN  ON-GOING  BASIS, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THESE ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, INVENTORY VALUATION AND OBSOLESCENCE, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL, INCOME  TAXES, CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY USES ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN CALCULATIONS TO DETERMINE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, THE FAIR VALUE OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES, AND EVALUATION OF LITIGATION. THE COMPANY BASES ITS ESTIMATES  ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT IT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY  APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019, WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 842. REFER TO NOTE 1 OF THIS FORM  10-Q  FOR DISCLOSURE OF THE CHANGES RELATED TO THIS ADOPTION.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO ADDITIONAL MATERIAL CHANGES TO  OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS DISCUSSED IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K  (THE \u201c2018  10-K\u201d).

THE DECREASE IN DETECTION ENGINEERING AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 IS DUE PRIMARILY TO CLINICAL EXPENSES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BREAST TOMOSYNTHESIS PRODUCT. THE DECREASE IN THERAPY ENGINEERING AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THE NINE  MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 IS DUE PRIMARILY TO DECREASES IN PERSONNEL AND CLINICAL TRIAL COSTS THAT WERE HIGHER IN 2018.

THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE IS DUE TO THE INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES ISSUED IN DECEMBER 2018 AND A HIGHER  INTEREST RATE UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S LOAN WITH SILICON VALLEY BANK IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

THE COMPANY RECORDED A LOSS OF $0.9 MILLION IN THE QUARTER  ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH REFLECTS AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNSECURED SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES ISSUES IN DECEMBER 2018 (THE \u201cCONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES\u201d) FROM APPROXIMATELY $11.4 MILLION AT JUNE 30,  2019 TO $12.3 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THE COMPANY RECORDED A LOSS OF $5.3 MILLION IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH REFLECTS AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES FROM APPROXIMATELY  $7.0 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $12.3 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THE COMPANY EXPECTS CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES TO CHANGE FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AS CHANGES IN THE STOCK PRICE OF THE COMPANY  DRIVE CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING FAIR VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS.  TAX EXPENSE.  THE COMPANY HAD TAX EXPENSE OF $6,000 FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO TAX EXPENSE OF $26,000 FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

TAX EXPENSE IS DUE PRIMARILY TO STATE  NON-INCOME  AND FRANCHISE BASED TAXES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR  CURRENT LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ARE SUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH ON HAND. OUR PROJECTED CASH NEEDS INCLUDE PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, LOAN REPAYMENTS, LEASE COMMITMENTS, AND  OTHER LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH ADEQUATE TO MEET ITS FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND PRIMARILY ON OPERATING CASH FLOW. IF SALES OR CASH COLLECTIONS ARE REDUCED FROM CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, OR IF  EXPENSES AND CASH REQUIREMENTS ARE INCREASED, THE COMPANY MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FINANCING, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE FINANCING IF NECESSARY. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR ITS  LIQUIDITY AND THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD CURRENT ASSETS OF $29.2 MILLION INCLUDING  $17.4 MILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. CURRENT LIABILITIES ARE $16.6 MILLION AND WORKING CAPITAL IS $12.7 MILLION. THE RATIO OF CURRENT ASSETS TO CURRENT LIABILITIES IS 1.76:1.

THE COMPANY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. ON NOVEMBER 13, 2019, THE COMPANY  ENTERED INTO A FIFTH LOAN MODIFICATION AGREEMENT WITH THE BANK. THE FIFTH LOAN MODIFICATION AGREEMENT AMENDED THE EBITDA COVENANT FOR THE TRAILING  SIX-MONTH  PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019 TO NOT MORE  THAN $(4.0 MILLION) FROM NOT MORE THAN $(2.0 MILLION). ALL OTHER TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT REMAINED THE SAME.  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  NET CASH USED FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(4,772  )  $(2,322  )  NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (219  )  (116  )  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED FOR) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  10,233  (139  )  INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND EQUIVALENTS  $5,242  $(2,577  )  NET CASH USED FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $4.8 MILLION, COMPARED  TO NET CASH USED FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $2.3 MILLION FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE CASH USED FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM OUR NET  LOSS OFFSET BY WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES RESULTING FROM INCREASES IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PREPAID EXPENSES AND INVENTORY, OFFSET BY INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND NOTES AND LEASE PAYABLE. WE EXPECT THAT  CASH USED FOR OR PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES MAY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS AS A RESULT OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS, THE TIMING OF WHEN WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE, COLLECTIONS OF ACCOUNTS AND THE TIMING OF  OTHER PAYMENTS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  HISTORICALLY,  OUR PRIMARY OPERATIONS INVOLVED THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF A LINE OF PROPRIETARY HIGH AND LOW TEMPERATURE DYEING  AND FINISHING MACHINERY TO THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY. OUR PRODUCTS FEATURE A HIGH DEGREE OF BOTH AUTOMATION AND MECHANICAL-ELECTRICAL  INTEGRATION. OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED IN DYEING YARNS SUCH AS PURE COTTON, COTTON-POLYESTER, TERYLENE, POLYESTER WOOL, POLY-ACRYLIC  FIBER, NYLON, COTTON RAMIE, AND WOOL YARN. WE ARE CONTINUING TO SEEK TO UTILIZE OUR EXPERTISE IN MANUFACTURING PRECISION PRODUCTS  TO MEET DEMAND IN NEW AND EXISTING END MARKETS.  WE DESIGN AND  PRODUCE AIRFLOW DYEING MACHINES, WHICH USE AIR INSTEAD OF WATER. WATER IS USED IN THE TRADITIONAL DYEING PROCESS. WE BELIEVE THAT  OUR AIR-FLOW TECHNOLOGY, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO ENABLE USERS TO MEET THE STRICTER ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS, RESULTS IN REDUCED INPUT  COSTS, FEWER WRINKLES, LESS DAMAGE TO THE TEXTILE, AND REDUCED EMISSIONS. HISTORICALLY, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT\u2019S MANDATE  TO PHASE OUT OLDER MACHINERY IN CHINA\u2019S TEXTILE INDUSTRY THAT DOES NOT MEET THE NEW ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS HAS BENEFITTED  US. HOWEVER, IN RECENT YEARS, CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCREASES IN RAW MATERIALS PRICES AND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT\u2019S  MORE AGGRESSIVE STANCE TOWARD SHUTTING DOWN FACTORIES, INCLUDING TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS, THAT ARE NOT COMPLIANT WITH EMISSION STANDARDS,  HAVE ADVERSELY IMPACTED OUR DYEING AND FINISHING BUSINESSES. DUE TO RISING PRODUCTION COSTS, MANY OTHER TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS ARE  CLOSING OR RELOCATING TO OTHER COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF CHINA IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.  IN AN EFFORT TO  IMPROVE OUR PRODUCT OFFERING AND APPEAL TO TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS OUTSIDE OF OUR CURRENT CUSTOMER BASE IN CHINA, WE HAVE DEVELOPED  PROTOTYPES OF NEXT GENERATION DYEING AND FINISHING EQUIPMENT UTILIZING A PATENT WE PURCHASED IN AUGUST 2016 THAT COVERS OZONE-ULTRASONIC  TEXTILE DYEING EQUIPMENT. DUE TO THE CHALLENGING CONDITIONS FACING OUR CUSTOMERS, INCREASING RAW MATERIALS PRICES AND LABOR COSTS,  WE HAVE NOT RECORDED ANY REVENUES FROM THIS PATENT AND BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY TO YIELD SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT,  WE RECORDED A $1.9 MILLION IMPAIRMENT LOSS ON THIS ASSET DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.  WE ARE ALSO DIVERSIFYING OUR MANUFACTURING  OPERATIONS TO TARGET OTHER INDUSTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY AND ARE CONSTRUCTING A MOBILE PHONE COVER PRODUCTION LINE.  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, THE LINE IS NEARLY COMPLETED AND WE EXPECT TO BEGIN PRODUCTION IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2019.  WE ARE ACTIVELY EXPLORING OTHER NEW VENTURES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO OUR BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE. WE EXPECT OUR  REVENUE FROM DYEING AND FINISHING EQUIPMENT SEGMENT WILL REMAIN AT OR ABOUT ITS CURRENT QUARTERLY LEVEL IN THE NEAR FUTURE, ALTHOUGH  DECLINES ARE POSSIBLE.  21  ON DECEMBER 26, 2016, DYEING AND XUE MIAO,  AN UNRELATED INDIVIDUAL, FORMED SHENGXIN, IN WHICH DYEING HAS A 30% EQUITY INTEREST AND THE UNRELATED THIRD PARTY HOLDS A 70% INTEREST,  PURSUANT TO AN AGREEMENT DATED DECEMBER 23, 2016. SHENGXIN INTENDS TO DEVELOP, CONSTRUCT AND MAINTAIN PHOTOVOLTAIC POWER GENERATION  PROJECTS, KNOWN AS SOLAR FARMS, IN CHINA, MAINLY IN THE PROVINCES OF GUIZHOU AND YUNNAN. IN APRIL 2018, SHENGXIN SECURED AND INVESTED  IN A LARGE SOLAR PV PROJECT IN GUIZHOU PROVINCE. SHENGXIN PAID RMB40 MILLION FOR THE PROJECT RIGHTS AND ALSO ENGAGED A LOCAL CONTRACTOR  TO PROCEED WITH BUILDING THE PROJECT. HOWEVER, ON JUNE 1, 2018, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HALTED INSTALLATION OF NEW SOLAR FARMS FOR  THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR AND REDUCED SUBSIDIES FOR PROJECTS ALREADY UNDER CONSTRUCTION. ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT  THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WILL INVEST IN NEW SOLAR FARM OR PROVIDE THE SUBSIDIES NEEDED TO FUND PROJECTS.  OUR INVESTMENT IN SHENGXIN IS SUBJECT TO  A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. WE CANNOT GIVE ANY ASSURANCE THAT SHENGXIN WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ANY PERMITS, RAISE ANY REQUIRED FUNDING,  DEVELOP AND OPERATE OR SELL ANY SOLAR FARMS OR OPERATE PROFITABLY OR THAT DYEING WILL HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE ANY FUNDS THAT  MAY BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO FUND ANY SOLAR FARM PROJECTS FOR WHICH SHENGXIN MAY OBTAIN PERMITS. THERE MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT DELAY  BETWEEN THE TIME FUNDS ARE ADVANCED FOR ANY PROJECT AND THE REALIZATION OF REVENUE OR CASH FLOW FROM ANY PROJECT. IN SEPTEMBER  2018, DUE TO SIGNIFICANT DOUBT ABOUT THE STATUS OF THIS PROJECT AND RECOVERABILITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT, WE FULLY  IMPAIRED THE VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT IN SHENGXIN IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $8.7 MILLION (EQUIVALENT TO RMB 59.8 MILLION).  THROUGH DECEMBER 30, 2016, WE OPERATED  IN THE FORGED ROLLED RINGS AND RELATED COMPONENTS SEGMENT, IN WHICH WE MANUFACTURED AND SOLD PRECISION FORGED ROLLED RINGS, SHAFTS,  FLANGES, AND OTHER FORGED COMPONENTS FOR THE ENERGY INDUSTRY INCLUDING WIND POWER AND OTHER INDUSTRIES, ON DECEMBER 30, 2016, WE  SOLD THE STOCK IN FULLAND WIND, THE SUBSIDIARY THAT OPERATED OUR FORGED ROLLED RINGS AND RELATED COMPONENTS BUSINESS, TO A NON-AFFILIATED  THIRD PARTY.  ADDITIONALLY,  DURING 2016, WE OPERATED A PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT SEGMENT, IN WHICH WE MANUFACTURED AND SOLD PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT.  BECAUSE OF A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN REVENUES FROM THIS SEGMENT, WE DETERMINED THAT WE WOULD NOT CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN THIS SEGMENT  AND ACCORDINGLY, THE PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT SEGMENT IS REFLECTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  RECENTLY, DIFFICULT  ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT IN CHINA AND TRADE TENSIONS WITH THE US PRESENTED NUMEROUS CHALLENGES FOR OUR  BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, WE EXPERIENCED SOFTER DEMAND FOR OUR LOW-EMISSION AIRFLOW DYEING MACHINES AS MANY OF OUR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS  ALREADY UPGRADED TO NEWER MODELS AND WE BELIEVE THAT MUCH OF OUR REMAINING POTENTIAL CUSTOMER BASE DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO  MAKE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT THIS TIME. AS A RESULT, IF WE ARE TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO THE SMALLER TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS,  IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR US TO DESIGN AND MARKET A CHEAPER MACHINE THAT MEETS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS OR REDUCE PRICES  WHICH WOULD IMPACT BOTH REVENUES AND GROSS MARGIN.  OUR ABILITY TO  EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS AND INCREASE OUR REVENUE IS LARGELY AFFECTED BY THE PRC GOVERNMENT\u2019S POLICY ON SUCH MATTERS AS THE  AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, WHICH AFFECTS ALL OF OUR OPERATIONS, AND ITS POLICIES RELATING TO THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY, ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES  AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AS WELL AS THE COMPETITIVENESS OF CHINESE TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS AT A TIME WHEN CONSUMERS ARE LOOKING FOR  LOWER PRICES AND MANUFACTURERS ARE LOOKING TO PRODUCE IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS LOWER LABOR COSTS THAN CHINA, ALL OF WHICH AFFECTS  THE MARKET FOR OUR DYEING AND FINISHING EQUIPMENT. OUR BUSINESS IS ALSO AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND WE CANNOT ASSURE  YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO INCREASE OUR REVENUES IN THE NEAR FUTURE, IF AT ALL. FOR EXAMPLE, TARIFFS LEVIED ON CHINESE TEXTILE  MANUFACTURERS BY THE US HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR CUSTOMERS AND LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT FROM US. BECAUSE  OF THE NATURE OF OUR PRODUCTS, OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THEIR DECISIONS  AS TO WHETHER TO PURCHASE CAPITAL EQUIPMENT AT THIS TIME OR DEFER SUCH PURCHASES UNTIL A FUTURE DATE.  GIVEN THE HEADWINDS  AFFECTING OUR MANUFACTURING BUSINESS, WE CONTINUED TO PURSUE WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE HIGH GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COMPANY, PARTICULARLY  OUR NEW BUSINESS DIVISIONS FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHARING ECONOMY PLATFORMS AND RELATED RENTAL BUSINESSES WITHIN THE COMPANY.  THESE INITIATIVES ARE STILL IN AN EARLY STAGE AND ARE DEPENDENT IN LARGE PART ON AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL TO FUND THEIR FUTURE GROWTH.  WE DID NOT GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES FROM OUR SHARING ECONOMY BUSINESS INITIATIVES IN 2018 OR DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  22  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  INSPIRIT STUDIO  DURING THE PERIOD, BUDDIGO, THE SHARING ECONOMY MOBILE PLATFORM DEVELOPED BY INSPIRIT STUDIO LIMITED (\u201cINSPIRIT STUDIO\u201d),  CONTINUOUSLY PROMOTED ITS SERVICE TO THE LOCAL MARKET IN HONG KONG. BUDDIGO OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF ERRAND SERVICES. CURRENTLY,  ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE ORDERS RECEIVED ARE FOR ON-DEMAND URGENT DELIVERY OF ITEMS SUCH AS DOCUMENTS, FLOWERS AND CAKES. FOOD DELIVERY  SERVICES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE. DURING THE PERIOD FROM SEPTEMBER 2018 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OVER 1,200 INDIVIDUALS HAVE OFFICIALLY  REGISTERED AS SELL-SIDE BUDDIES, WHO COMPLETED OVER 600 DELIVERY ORDERS FROM SEPTEMBER 2018 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, MAJORITY ORDERS  WERE HAPPENED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF YEAR 2018. IN ADDITION, BUDDIGO HAS SIGNED UP WITH A NUMBER OF LOCAL BUSINESS PARTNERS TO  PROVIDE ONGOING DELIVERY SERVICES FOR THESE CLIENTS. BUDDIGO\u2019S GOAL IS TO CONNECT WITH THE COMMUNITY AND DELIVER LOCALIZED  CONTENT FEATURING BUDDIGO\u2019S CORE FEATURES AND ADVANTAGES. BUDDIGO IS ACTIVELY SEEKING STRATEGIC INVESTORS OR COLLABORATIVE  PARTIES WHO ARE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT ITS BUSINESS MODEL AND CAN HELP ACHIEVE ITS BUSINESS TARGETS AND EXPAND INTO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.  ANYWORKSPACE LIMITED  ANYWORKSPACE, OUR COWORKING BUSINESS UNIT,  IS FOCUSED ON ENLARGING ITS EXPOSURE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

ANYWORKSPACE WILL ALSO FOCUS ON DIGITAL MARKETING ACTIVITIES FOR ITS MARKET EXPANSION PLANS WHEN  THERE IS AVAILABLE CASH FLOW OR FUNDS FROM INVESTORS.  GIVEN THE EXISTING COWORKING SPACES PROVIDERS  MARKETING THEIR AVAILABLE SPACES AND MANAGING INDIVIDUAL ONLINE BUSINESS PLATFORM THEMSELVES, WE EXPECT OUR CURRENT GLOBAL ONLINE  PLATFORM WILL TAKE YEARS TO MATERIALIZE ITS WORLDWIDE CUSTOMER BASE. THEREFORE, THE INTANGIBLE ASSET AMOUNTED TO $0.6 MILLION (EQUIVALENT  TO HK$4.97 MILLION) REPRESENTING THE ONLINE PLATFORM ACQUIRED HAS BEEN FULLY IMPAIRED IN THE LAST QUARTER OF 2018.  3D DISCOVERY CO. LIMITED  3D DISCOVERY, AN IT SERVICE PROVIDER THAT  DEVELOPS VIRTUAL TOURS FOR THE REAL ESTATE, HOSPITALITY AND INTERIOR DESIGN INDUSTRIES. 3D DISCOVERY\u2019S SPACE CAPTURING AND  MODELING TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY USED BY SOME OF HONG KONG\u2019S LEADING PROPERTY AGENCIES TO PROVIDE THEIR CLIENTS WITH  A TRULY IMMERSIVE, FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE OF A PHYSICAL SPACE WHILE SAVING THEM TIME AND MONEY. ACCORDING TO GOLDMAN SACHS, THE  REAL ESTATE VIRTUAL REALITY (\u201cVR\u201d) INDUSTRY IS PREDICTED TO REACH $2.6 BILLION IN 2025, SUPPORTED BY A POTENTIAL  USER BASE OF OVER 1.4 MILLION REGISTERED REAL ESTATE AGENTS IN SOME OF THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST MARKETS. APART FROM ITS EXISTING  PROFITABLE OPERATIONS, 3D DISCOVERY IS DEVELOPING A MOBILE APP, AUTOCAP, WHICH ALLOWS USERS TO CREATE AN INTERACTIVE VIRTUAL TOUR  OF A PHYSICAL SPACE BY USING A MOBILE PHONE CAMERA.  3D DISCOVERY SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED A NUMBER OF PROJECTS DURING  THE YEAR. FIRST, ITS \u201c3D VIRTUAL TOURS IN HONG KONG\u201d GENERATED ABOUT 1,371,000 IMPRESSIONS IN 2018. IN ADDITION, 3D  DISCOVERY PARTNERED WITH MIDLAND REALTY, ONE OF THE LARGEST REAL ESTATE AGENCIES IN HONG KONG, TO ESTABLISH THE \u201cCREATION  200 3D VIRTUAL TOURS.\u201d.  EC ADVERTISING  LIMITED  FOLLOWING THE  ACQUISITION OF BUDDIGO, ANYWORKSPACE AND 3D DISCOVERY BY THE COMPANY DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN LATE 2017 AND THE FIRST HALF YEAR  OF 2018, EC ADVERTISING LIMITED (\u201cEC ADVERTISING\u201d) HAS BEEN DEVELOPING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THESE THREE PLATFORMS TO ATTRACT  ADVERTISERS.  DURING THE PERIOD,  WE ESTABLISHED A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY IN XIAMEN, FUJIAN PROVINCE OF MAINLAND CHINA, WHICH IS INTENDED TO COVER OUR ADVERTISING  BUSINESS IN THIS REGION. WE STARTED MEETING WITH A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL CLIENTS THERE AND ANTICIPATE THAT THIS ADVERTISING COMPANY  WILL CONFIRM WITH THEM SEVERAL MARKETING CAMPAIGNS. IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE OUR EXPOSURE TO THE POTENTIAL CLIENTS IN MAINLAND CHINA,  WE ARE DEVELOPING A STRATEGIC MEDIA PLAN WHICH WILL COVER MAJOR CITIES IN MAINLAND CHINA SUCH AS BEIJING, SHANGHAI, GUANGZHOU AND  SHENZHEN. MAJOR BANKS, REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS ARE OUR TARGET CLIENTS. MORE IMPORTANTLY,  OUR PRESENCE IN MAINLAND CHINA CAN FACILITATE THE ROLLOUT OF FRANCHISE PROGRAMS OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS, WHICH IS ONE OF THE REVENUE  DRIVERS FOR THE COMPANY.  23  ECRENT PLATFORM  BUSINESS  ASIA REGION.  IN 2018, OUR SUBSIDIARY SEIL ENTERED INTO  A LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH ECRENT, REGARDING THE GRANT OF AN EXCLUSIVE AND SUBLICENSABLE LICENSE FROM ECRENT TO SEII TO UTILIZE CERTAIN  SOFTWARE AND TRADEMARKS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP, LAUNCH, OPERATE, COMMERCIALIZE, AND MAINTAIN AN ONLINE WEBSITE PLATFORM IN TAIWAN,  THAILAND, INDIA, INDONESIA, SINGAPORE, MALAYSIA, PHILIPPINES, VIETNAM, CAMBODIA, JAPAN, AND KOREA. ACCORDING TO THE LATEST AMENDMENT,  ECRENT WILL GUARANTEE THAT THE OPERATION OF ITS RELATED WEBSITES, MOBILE APPLICATIONS AND BUSINESS SERVICES WILL CONTRIBUTE REVENUE  OF $13,000,000 (INCREASED FROM $10,000,000 ACCORDING TO THE PREVIOUSLY AMENDED AGREEMENT) AND GROSS PROFIT OF $2,522,000 (UP FROM  $1,940,000 AS STATED ON THE PREVIOUSLY AMENDED AGREEMENT) FROM THE CLOSING DATE OF THE LICENSE AGREEMENT THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019  (EXTENDED FROM SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 PER THE PREVIOUSLY AMENDED AGREEMENT).  IN AUGUST 2018, SEIL HAS ENTERED INTO A  LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH PTI CORPORATION (\u201cPTI\u201d), THAT SUBLICENSES SEIL\u2019S EXCLUSIVE LICENSE WITH ECRENT TO UTILIZE  CERTAIN SOFTWARE AND TRADEMARKS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP, LAUNCH, OPERATE, COMMERCIALIZE, AND MAINTAIN AN ONLINE WEBSITE PLATFORM IN  SOUTH KOREA. IN RETURN, PTI SHALL PAY TO SEIL $230,000 (\u201cCONSIDERATION\u201d). THE LICENSE AGREEMENT WILL BE EFFECTIVE ON  SEPTEMBER 1, 2018 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019. IN ADDITION, IF THE AGGREGATE REVENUE DURING THE PERIOD EXCEEDS THE CONSIDERATION,  SEIL SHALL RECEIVE 30% OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AGGREGATE REVENUE AND THE CONSIDERATION. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018,  PTI COMMENCED PRELAUNCH ACTIVITIES TO DEVELOP THE PLATFORM.  EUROPE REGION.  IN AUGUST 2018, OUR SUBSIDIARY SEIL ENTERED  INTO A LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH ECRENT REGARDING THE GRANT OF AN EXCLUSIVE AND SUBLICENSABLE LICENSE FROM ECRENT TO SEII TO UTILIZE  CERTAIN SOFTWARE AND TRADEMARKS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP, LAUNCH, OPERATE, COMMERCIALIZE, AND MAINTAIN AN ONLINE WEBSITE PLATFORM IN  UNITED KINGDOM, GERMANY, FRANCE, POLAND, SWITZERLAND, NETHERLANDS, DENMARK, RUSSIA, ITALY, SPAIN, PORTUGAL AND GREECE. IN RETURN,  SEII SHALL ISSUE TO ECRENT 360,000 SHARES OF RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK. CLOSING OF THIS TRANSACTION WAS CONDITIONED ON VARIOUS CONDITIONS,  INCLUDING RECEIPT OF ALL NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS. ON OCTOBER 9, 2018, THE AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED BY THE PARTIES, WHO HAVE  AGREED TO FOREGO THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS UNDER THE AGREEMENT.  GOING FORWARD,  WE WILL CONTINUE TARGETING THE TECHNOLOGY AND GLOBAL SHARING ECONOMY MARKETS, BY DEVELOPING ONLINE PLATFORMS AND RENTAL BUSINESS  PARTNERSHIPS THAT WILL DRIVE THE GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT OF SHARING THROUGH ECONOMICAL RENTAL BUSINESS MODELS.  INVENTORY AND  RAW MATERIALS  A MAJOR ELEMENT OF OUR COST OF REVENUES  IS RAW MATERIALS, PRINCIPALLY STEEL AS WELL AS OTHER METALS. THESE METALS ARE SUBJECT TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS, AND RECENTLY THESE  FLUCTUATIONS HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT. IN TIMES OF INCREASING PRICES, WE NEED TO TRY TO ESTABLISH THE PRICE AT WHICH WE PURCHASE RAW  MATERIALS IN ORDER TO AVOID INCREASES IN COSTS WHICH WE CANNOT RECOUP THROUGH INCREASES IN SALES PRICES. SIMILARLY, IN TIMES OF  DECREASING PRICES, WE MAY HAVE PURCHASED METALS AT PRICES WHICH ARE HIGH IN TERMS OF THE PRICE AT WHICH WE CAN SELL OUR PRODUCTS,  WHICH ALSO CAN IMPAIR OUR MARGINS. TWO MAJOR SUPPLIERS PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY 40% OF OUR PURCHASES OF INVENTORIES FOR THE NINE  MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. FOUR MAJOR SUPPLIERS PROVIDED 77% OF OUR PURCHASES OF INVENTORIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2018.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE  BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES  AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE  RELATED TO BAD DEBTS, INVENTORIES, RECOVERY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCOME TAXES AND THE VALUATION OF EQUITY TRANSACTIONS.  WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES  ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS  OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT  FROM OTHER SOURCES. ANY FUTURE CHANGES TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL CHANGE TO OUR REPORTED AMOUNTS  OF REVENUES, EXPENSES, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION  OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  24  VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES  PURSUANT TO ASC  TOPIC 810 AND RELATED SUBTOPICS RELATED TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (\u201cVIES\u201d). THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS REQUIRE  A VIE TO BE CONSOLIDATED BY A COMPANY IF THAT COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A MAJORITY OF THE RISK OF LOSS FOR THE VIE OR IS ENTITLED TO  RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE VIE\u2019S RESIDUAL RETURNS. VIES ARE THOSE ENTITIES IN WHICH WE, THROUGH CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS,  BEAR THE RISK OF, AND ENJOY THE REWARDS NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH OWNERSHIP OF THE ENTITY, AND THEREFORE WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY  OF THE ENTITY.  DYEING AND HEAVY  INDUSTRIES ARE CONSIDERED VIES, AND WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. ON NOVEMBER 13, 2007, WE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THE DYEING  PURSUANT TO WHICH WE SHALL RECEIVE 100% OF DYEING\u2019S NET INCOME. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE AGREEMENTS, DYEING SHALL PAY CONSULTING  FEES EQUAL TO 100% OF ITS NET INCOME TO OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, GREEN POWER, AND GREEN POWER SHALL SUPPLY THE TECHNOLOGY AND  ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES NEEDED TO SERVICE DYEING.  THE ACCOUNTS OF  THE DYEING AND HEAVY INDUSTRIES ARE CONSOLIDATED IN THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS A VIE, DYEING AND HEAVY INDUSTRIES\u2019S  SALES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR TOTAL SALES, ITS INCOME FROM OPERATIONS IS CONSOLIDATED WITH OURS, AND OUR NET INCOME INCLUDES ALL OF  THE HUAYANG COMPANIES\u2019 NET INCOME, AND THEIR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE  VIES DO NOT HAVE ANY NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST AND, ACCORDINGLY, WE DID NOT SUBTRACT ANY NET INCOME IN CALCULATING THE NET INCOME  ATTRIBUTABLE TO US. BECAUSE OF THE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, WE HAVE PECUNIARY INTEREST IN DYEING THAT REQUIRE CONSOLIDATION OF  THE DYEING\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  WE HAVE A POLICY  OF RESERVING FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR EXISTING ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE. WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN ALLOWANCE IS NECESSARY BASED ON AN ANALYSIS  OF PAST DUE ACCOUNTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY INDICATE THAT THE REALIZATION OF AN ACCOUNT MAY BE IN DOUBT. ACCOUNT BALANCES DEEMED  TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE ARE CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE AFTER ALL MEANS OF COLLECTION HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED AND THE POTENTIAL FOR RECOVERY  IS CONSIDERED REMOTE.  AS A BASIS FOR  ESTIMATING THE LIKELIHOOD OF COLLECTION HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, WE CONSIDER A NUMBER OF FACTORS WHEN DETERMINING RESERVES FOR UNCOLLECTABLE  ACCOUNTS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE USE A REASONABLY RELIABLE METHODOLOGY TO ESTIMATE THE COLLECTABILITY OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. WE  REVIEW OUR ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS ON AT LEAST A QUARTERLY BASIS. WE ALSO CONSIDER WHETHER THE HISTORICAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS  ARE COMPARABLE TO CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR OTHER PARTIES THAT WE HAVE BUSINESS  RELATIONS WITH WERE TO DETERIORATE, RESULTING IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES MAY BE  REQUIRED.  INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES, CONSISTING  OF RAW MATERIALS, WORK-IN-PROCESS AND FINISHED GOODS, ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE UTILIZING THE WEIGHTED  AVERAGE METHOD. AN ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED WHEN MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT CERTAIN INVENTORIES MAY NOT BE SALEABLE. IF INVENTORY  COSTS EXCEED EXPECTED MARKET VALUE DUE TO OBSOLESCENCE OR QUANTITIES IN EXCESS OF EXPECTED DEMAND, WE WILL RECORD ADDITIONAL RESERVES  FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND THE MARKET VALUE. THESE RESERVES ARE RECORDED BASED ON ESTIMATES. WE REVIEW INVENTORY QUANTITIES  ON HAND AND ON ORDER AND RECORD, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, A PROVISION FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY, IF NECESSARY. IF THE RESULTS  OF THE REVIEW DETERMINE THAT A WRITE-DOWN IS NECESSARY, WE RECOGNIZE A LOSS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE LOSS IS IDENTIFIED, WHETHER  OR NOT THE INVENTORY IS RETAINED. OUR INVENTORY RESERVES ESTABLISH A NEW COST BASIS FOR INVENTORY AND ARE NOT REVERSED UNTIL WE  SELL OR DISPOSE OF THE RELATED INVENTORY. SUCH PROVISIONS ARE ESTABLISHED BASED ON HISTORICAL USAGE, ADJUSTED FOR KNOWN CHANGES  IN DEMANDS FOR SUCH PRODUCTS, OR THE ESTIMATED FORECAST OF PRODUCT DEMAND AND PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS.  25  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST  LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED USING STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS.  THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  USEFUL LIFE  BUILDING AND BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS  5 \u2013 20 YEARS  MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT  5 \u2013 10 YEARS  OFFICE EQUIPMENT AND FURNITURE  5 YEARS  VEHICLES  5 YEARS  THE COST OF REPAIRS  AND MAINTENANCE IS EXPENSED AS INCURRED; MAJOR REPLACEMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED. WHEN ASSETS ARE RETIRED OR DISPOSED  OF, THE COST AND ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED FROM THE ACCOUNTS, AND ANY RESULTING GAINS OR LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN THE  STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE YEAR OF DISPOSITION.  WE EXAMINE THE  POSSIBILITY OF DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF FIXED ASSETS WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES REFLECT THE FACT THAT THEIR RECORDED  VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. WE RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS WHEN THE SUM OF EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS IS LESS THAN  THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IS ACCOUNTED FOR  BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TOPIC OF ASC 718 WHICH REQUIRES RECOGNITION IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF  THE COST OF EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR SERVICES RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN AWARD OF EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OVER THE VESTING PERIOD OR IMMEDIATELY  IF THE AWARD IS NON-FORFEITABLE. THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION ALSO REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF THE COST OF EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR  SERVICES RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN AWARD BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD.  ADDITIONALLY, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017,  THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2016-09 (\u201cASU 2016-09\u201d), IMPROVEMENTS TO EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED  PAYMENT ACCOUNTING. ASU 2016-09 PERMITS THE ELECTION OF AN ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR FORFEITURES OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS, EITHER  TO RECOGNIZE FORFEITURES AS THEY OCCUR OR ESTIMATE FORFEITURES OVER THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE AWARD. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO  RECOGNIZE FORFEITURES AS THEY OCCUR AND THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE DID NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.  THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, PURSUANT TO  ASC 505-50 \u2013 \u201cEQUITY-BASED PAYMENTS TO NON-EMPLOYEES\u201d, ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO NON-EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS  OF STOCK OPTIONS, WERE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE  CONSULTING ARRANGEMENT OR UNTIL PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE MET. THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REASSESSED THE FAIR VALUE  OF NON-EMPLOYEE SHARE BASED PAYMENTS UNTIL SERVICE CONDITIONS ARE MET, WHICH GENERALLY ALIGNS WITH THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE EQUITY  INSTRUMENT, AND THE COMPANY ADJUSTS THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCORDINGLY. IN JUNE 2018,  THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-07, IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING, WHICH SIMPLIFIES SEVERAL ASPECTS OF  THE ACCOUNTING FOR NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS BY EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION GUIDANCE  IN ASC 718 TO INCLUDE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS FOR ACQUIRING GOODS AND SERVICES FROM NON-EMPLOYEES. ASU NO. 2018-07 IS  EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE ANNUAL PERIODS. EARLY ADOPTION  IS PERMITTED, BUT ENTITIES MAY NOT ADOPT PRIOR TO ADOPTING THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE IN ASC 606. THE COMPANY EARLY ADOPTED  ASU NO. 2018-07 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND THERE WAS NO CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ADOPTION.  26  CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES  OUR FUNCTIONAL  CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR, AND THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF OUR OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES AND VIES IS THE RMB AND HONG KONG DOLLAR.  SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SALES ARE DENOMINATED IN RMB. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUES OF U.S. DOLLARS AND RMB AFFECT  OUR REPORTED LEVELS OF REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY AS THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR REPORTING  PURPOSES. IN PARTICULAR, FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STABILITY DUE  TO A MISMATCH AMONG VARIOUS FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SALES AND COSTS. FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR  AND RMB AFFECT OUR GROSS AND NET PROFIT MARGINS AND COULD RESULT IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND OPERATING LOSSES.  OUR EXPOSURE TO  FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK PRIMARILY RELATES TO CURRENCY GAINS OR LOSSES RESULTING FROM TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SIGNING OF SALES  CONTRACTS AND SETTLING OF THESE CONTRACTS. FURTHERMORE, WE TRANSLATE MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN OTHER CURRENCIES  INTO RMB, THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF OUR OPERATING SUBSIDIARY. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE  EXCHANGE RATES DURING THE PERIOD, AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE TRANSLATED AT THE UNIFIED EXCHANGE RATE AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.  TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM THIS PROCESS ARE INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN OUR STATEMENT OF  SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. WE HAVE NOT USED ANY FORWARD CONTRACTS, CURRENCY OPTIONS OR BORROWINGS TO HEDGE OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN  CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT OF FUTURE EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND MAY  INCUR NET FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.  OUR FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS ARE EXPRESSED IN U.S. DOLLARS, WHICH IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF OUR PARENT COMPANY. THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF OUR  OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES IS RMB AND THE HONG KONG DOLLAR. TO THE EXTENT WE HOLD ASSETS DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS,  ANY APPRECIATION OF THE RMB OR HKD AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR COULD RESULT IN A CHARGE IN OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND A REDUCTION  IN THE VALUE OF OUR U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED ASSETS. ON THE OTHER HAND, A DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF RMB OR HKD AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR  COULD REDUCE THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT AMOUNTS OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-02,  \u201cLEASES (TOPIC 842)\u201d. UNDER ASU 2016-02, LESSEES WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE ALL LEASES (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SHORT-TERM  LEASES) AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE INCLUDING A LEASE LIABILITY, WHICH IS A LESSEE\u2019S OBLIGATION TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS ARISING  FROM A LEASE, MEASURED ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS; AND A RIGHT-OF-USE (ROU) ASSET, WHICH IS AN ASSET THAT REPRESENTS THE LESSEE\u2019S  RIGHT TO USE, OR CONTROL THE USE OF, A SPECIFIED ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM. LEASES WITH A TERM OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS WILL BE  ACCOUNTED FOR SIMILAR TO EXISTING GUIDANCE FOR OPERATING LEASES. IN DECEMBER 2017, JANUARY 2018, JULY 2018, DECEMBER 2018 AND MARCH  2019, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-13, ASU 2018-01, ASU 2018-10 & 11, ASU 2018-20 AND ASU 2019-01, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH CONTAIN  MODIFICATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO ASU 2016-02. THE AMENDMENTS PROVIDE ENTITIES WITH AN ADDITIONAL (AND OPTIONAL) TRANSITION METHOD  TO ADOPT THE NEW LEASES STANDARD. UNDER THE OPTIONAL TRANSITION METHOD, AN ENTITY INITIALLY APPLIES THE NEW LEASES STANDARD AT  THE ADOPTION DATE AND RECOGNIZES A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION.  ON JANUARY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASC TOPIC 842 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH AND ELECTED TO UTILIZE THE OPTIONAL  TRANSITION METHOD. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ELECTED THE LAND EASEMENT TRANSITION PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT AND DID NOT REASSESS WHETHER  AN EXISTING OR EXPIRED LAND EASEMENT IS A LEASE OR CONTAINS A LEASE IF IT HAS NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR AS A LEASE. THE  ADOPTION DID NOT IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S PREVIOUSLY REPORTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOR DID IT RESULT IN A CUMULATIVE  EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-07,  COMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT. ASU 2018-07 ALIGNS THE ACCOUNTING  FOR SHARE BASED PAYMENTS GRANTED TO NON-EMPLOYEES WITH THAT OF SHARE BASED PAYMENTS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY EARLY ADOPTED  ASU NO. 2018-07 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND THERE WAS NO CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ADOPTION. THE ADOPTION OF THIS ASU DID NOT  HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, OR PRESENTATION THEREOF.  27  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND 2018  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE RESULTS  OF OUR OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018 INDICATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES (DOLLARS  IN THOUSANDS).

FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF DYEING AND FINISHING EQUIPMENT DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $840,000, OR 33.4%,  AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, REVENUES FROM THE SALE  OF DYEING AND FINISHING EQUIPMENT DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $2,411,000, OR 31.5%, AS COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2018. WE EXPERIENCED AN ANTICIPATED SLOWDOWN IN SALES OF OUR LOW-EMISSION AIRFLOW DYEING MACHINES AS MANY CUSTOMERS HAD REPLACED  OLDER DYEING EQUIPMENT WITH OUR LOW-EMISSION AIRFLOW DYEING MACHINE, AND WE BELIEVE THAT ORDERS FOR NEW LOW-EMISSION AIRFLOW DYEING  MACHINES HAVE SLOWED DOWN IN 2018 AND 2017 BECAUSE THE REMAINING POTENTIAL CUSTOMER BASE INCLUDED MANY COMPANIES THAT DID NOT HAVE  THE ABILITY TO MAKE THE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES NECESSARY TO UPGRADE THEIR EQUIPMENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY  IN CHINA HAS BEEN FACING SIGNIFICANT HEADWINDS RECENTLY. DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, A CONTINUING DECLINE IN OIL PRICES AND  LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT IN CHINA, PRESENTED NUMEROUS CHALLENGES FOR OUR DYEING MACHINE BUSINESS. ADDITIONALLY, APPAREL FACTORIES  AND OTHER FACTORIES HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN THROUGHOUT THE LAST YEAR BY CHINA\u2019S ENVIRONMENTAL BUREAU, WHICH HAS BEEN CUTTING  ELECTRICITY AND GAS SUPPLY TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH CHINA\u2019S ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR REVENUES DECREASED IN  THE 2019 PERIOD AS COMPARED TO THE 2018 PERIOD. WE EXPECT THAT OUR REVENUES FROM DYEING AND FINISHING EQUIPMENT SEGMENT WILL REMAIN  AT OR ABOUT ITS CURRENT LEVEL IN THE NEAR FUTURE, ALTHOUGH DECLINES ARE POSSIBLE.  DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE RECOGNIZED REVENUES FROM OUR SHARING ECONOMY BUSINESS OF $533 AND $27,325 COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $73,000  AND $156,000 FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  28  COST OF REVENUES.  COST OF  REVENUES INCLUDES THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS, LABOR, DEPRECIATION AND OTHER FIXED AND VARIABLE OVERHEAD COSTS. FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COST OF REVENUES WAS APPROXIMATELY $1,874,000 AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $4,245,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, A DECREASE OF $2,371,000, OR 55.9%. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COST OF REVENUES WAS  APPROXIMATELY $10,106,000 AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $10,462,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, A DECREASE OF  $356,000, OR 3.4%.  GROSS LOSS AND GROSS MARGIN.  OUR GROSS LOSS  WAS APPROXIMATELY $(197,000) FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO GROSS LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $(1,728,000)  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, REPRESENTING GROSS MARGINS OF (11.7%) AND (68.6%), RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE PERIOD  OVER PERIOD. OUR GROSS LOSS WAS APPROXIMATELY $(4,862,000) FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO GROSS LOSS  OF APPROXIMATELY $(2,807,000) FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, REPRESENTING GROSS MARGINS OF (92.7)% AND (36.7)%,  RESPECTIVELY, A DECREASE PERIOD OVER PERIOD. THE DECREASE IN OUR GROSS MARGIN FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS  PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCED SCALE OF OPERATIONS RESULTING FROM LOWER REVENUES, WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE ALLOCATION OF  FIXED COSTS, MAINLY CONSISTING OF DEPRECIATION, TO COST OF REVENUES, AN INCREASE IN LABOR AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS, AND THE INCREASE  IN IMPAIRMENT LOSS ON INVENTORY.  OPERATING EXPENSES.

RESPIRERX  IS DEVELOPING A PIPELINE OF NEW DRUG PRODUCTS BASED ON OUR BROAD PATENT PORTFOLIOS FOR TWO DRUG PLATFORMS: AMPAKINES, PROPRIETARY  COMPOUNDS THAT POSITIVELY MODULATE AMPA-TYPE GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS TO PROMOTE NEURONAL FUNCTION AND CANNABINOIDS, INCLUDING DRONABINOL  (\u201c\u22069-THC\u201d).  AMPAKINES  SINCE  ITS FORMATION IN 1987, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN THE RESEARCH AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF A CLASS OF PROPRIETARY COMPOUNDS  KNOWN AS AMPAKINES, A TERM USED TO DESIGNATE THEIR ACTIONS AS POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATORS OF THE ALPHA-AMINO-3- HYDROXY-5-METHYL-4-ISOXAZOLEPROPIONIC  ACID (\u201cAMPA\u201d) GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR. AMPAKINES ARE SMALL MOLECULE COMPOUNDS THAT ENHANCE THE EXCITATORY ACTIONS OF THE  NEUROTRANSMITTER GLUTAMATE AT THE AMPA RECEPTOR COMPLEX, WHICH MEDIATES MOST EXCITATORY TRANSMISSION IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM  (\u201cCNS\u201d). THESE DRUGS DO NOT HAVE AGONISTIC OR ANTAGONISTIC PROPERTIES BUT INSTEAD POSITIVELY MODULATE THE RECEPTOR  RATE CONSTANTS FOR TRANSMITTER BINDING, CHANNEL OPENING, AND DESENSITIZATION. WE CURRENTLY ARE DEVELOPING TWO LEAD CLINICAL COMPOUNDS,  CX717 AND CX1739, AND ONE PRE-CLINICAL COMPOUND, CX1942. THESE COMPOUNDS BELONG TO A NEW CLASS OF AMPAKINES THAT DO NOT DISPLAY  THE ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL EFFECTS THAT LED TO UNDESIRABLE SIDE EFFECTS, NAMELY CONVULSIVE ACTIVITIES, PREVIOUSLY  REPORTED IN ANIMAL MODELS OF EARLIER GENERATIONS.  THE  COMPANY OWNS PATENTS AND PATENT APPLICATIONS, OR THE RIGHTS THERETO, FOR CERTAIN FAMILIES OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS, INCLUDING AMPAKINES,  WHICH CLAIM THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURES, THEIR ACTIONS AS AMPAKINES AND THEIR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS DISORDERS. PATENTS CLAIMING  A FAMILY OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES, INCLUDING CX1739 AND CX1942, AS WELL AS THEIR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS DISORDERS EXTEND  THROUGH AT LEAST 2028. ADDITIONAL PATENT APPLICATIONS CLAIMING THE USE OF AMPAKINES IN THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN NEUROLOGICAL AND  NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS, SUCH AS ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (\u201cADHD\u201d) HAVE BEEN OR ARE EXPECTED TO  BE FILED IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  IN  2007, WE DETERMINED THAT EXPANSION OF OUR STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT INTO THE AREAS OF CENTRAL RESPIRATORY DYSFUNCTION, INCLUDING DRUG-INDUCED  RESPIRATORY DYSFUNCTION, REPRESENTED COST-EFFECTIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR POTENTIALLY RAPID DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF RESPIRERX\u2019S  COMPOUNDS. ON MAY 8, 2007, RESPIRERX ENTERED INTO A LICENSE AGREEMENT, AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED, WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA  GRANTING RESPIRERX EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO METHOD OF TREATMENT PATENTS HELD BY THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA CLAIMING THE USE OF AMPAKINES  FOR THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS RESPIRATORY DISORDERS. THESE PATENTS, ALONG WITH RESPIRERX\u2019S OWN PATENTS CLAIMING CHEMICAL  STRUCTURES, COMPRISED RESPIRERX\u2019S PRINCIPAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUPPORTING RESPIRERX\u2019S RESEARCH AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT  PROGRAM IN THE USE OF AMPAKINES FOR THE TREATMENT OF CENTRAL AND DRUG-INDUCED RESPIRATORY DISORDERS.  33  THROUGH  AN EXTENSIVE TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH EFFORT FROM THE CELLULAR LEVEL THROUGH PHASE 2 CLINICAL TRIALS, THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED  A FAMILY OF NOVEL, LOW IMPACT AMPAKINES, INCLUDING CX717, CX1739 AND CX1942 THAT HAVE CLINICAL APPLICATION IN THE TREATMENT OF  NEUROBEHAVIORAL DISORDERS, CNS-DRIVEN RESPIRATORY DISORDERS, SPINAL CORD INJURY, NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES, AND ORPHAN INDICATIONS.  WE HAVE BEEN ADDRESSING CNS-DRIVEN RESPIRATORY DISORDERS THAT AFFECT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, BUT FOR WHICH THERE ARE FEW TREATMENT  OPTIONS AND LIMITED DRUG THERAPIES, INCLUDING OPIOID INDUCED RESPIRATORY DISORDERS, SUCH AS APNEA (TRANSIENT CESSATION OF BREATHING)  OR HYPOPNEA (TRANSIENT REDUCTION IN BREATHING). WHEN THESE SYMPTOMS BECOME SEVERE, AS IN OPIOID OVERDOSE, THEY ARE THE PRIMARY  CAUSE OF OPIOID LETHALITY.  RESPIRERX  HAS COMPLETED PRE-CLINICAL STUDIES INDICATING THAT SEVERAL OF ITS AMPAKINES, INCLUDING CX717, CX1739 AND CX1942, WERE EFFICACIOUS  IN TREATING DRUG INDUCED RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION CAUSED BY OPIOIDS OR CERTAIN ANESTHETICS WITHOUT ALTERING THE ANALGESIC EFFECTS  OF THE OPIOIDS OR THE ANESTHETIC EFFECTS OF THE ANESTHETICS. THE RESULTS OF OUR PRECLINICAL RESEARCH STUDIES HAVE BEEN REPLICATED  IN THREE SEPARATE PHASE 2A HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS WITH TWO AMPAKINES, CX717 AND CX1739, CONFIRMING THE TRANSLATIONAL MECHANISM  AND TARGET SITE ENGAGEMENT AND DEMONSTRATING PROOF OF PRINCIPLE THAT AMPAKINES ACT AS POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATORS OF AMPA RECEPTORS  IN HUMANS AND CAN BE USED IN HUMANS FOR THE PREVENTION OF OPIOID INDUCED APNEA. IN ADDITION, RESPIRERX HAS CONDUCTED A PHASE 2A  CLINICAL STUDY IN WHICH PATIENTS WITH SLEEP APNEA WERE ADMINISTERED CX1739, RESPIRERX\u2019S LEAD CLINICAL COMPOUND. THE RESULTS  SUGGESTED THAT CX1739 MIGHT HAVE USE AS A TREATMENT FOR CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA (\u201cCSA\u201d) AND MIXED SLEEP APNEA, BUT NOT  OSA.  RESPIRERX  IS COMMITTED TO ADVANCING THE AMPAKINES THROUGH THE CLINICAL AND REGULATORY PATH TO APPROVAL AND COMMERCIALIZATION. UNTIL RECENTLY,  RESPIRERX HAS FOCUSED ON THE AMPAKINES\u2019 ABILITY TO ANTAGONIZE OPIOID INDUCED RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION BOTH AS A TRANSLATIONAL  TOOL TO VERIFY TARGET ENGAGEMENT, AS WELL AS AN EVENTUAL COMMERCIAL INDICATION. WE BELIEVE THE LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY 70,000 LIVES  IN OUR COUNTRY LAST YEAR ALONE DEMANDS THAT NEW SOLUTIONS FOR OPIOID INDUCED DEATHS BE DEVELOPED TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC HEALTH.  34  TO  THIS END, THE COMPANY HAS CONDUCTED PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH WITH CX1739, CX717 AND CX1942 IN THE PREVENTION, TREATMENT,  AND MANAGEMENT OF OPIOID INDUCED APNEA, THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF OVERDOSE DEATHS. IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE CONDUCTED SEVERAL PHASE 2  CLINICAL TRIALS DEMONSTRATING THAT BOTH CX717 AND CX1739 SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OPIOID INDUCED RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION (\u201cOIRD\u201d)  WITHOUT ALTERING ANALGESIA. SINCE ONE OF THE PRIMARY RISK FACTORS FOR OPIOID OVERDOSE IS CSA, IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT A PHASE 2A  CLINICAL STUDY WITH CX1739 PRODUCED DATA SUGGESTING A POSSIBLE REDUCTION IN CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA. BECAUSE THERE ARE NEITHER DRUGS  NOR DEVICES APPROVED TO TREAT CSA, COMPANY MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR A RAPID PATH TO COMMERCIALIZATION.  UNFORTUNATELY,  RATHER THAN SUPPORT NOVEL APPROACHES FOR OPIOID TREATMENT, THE RECENT PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENTAL DISCOURSES REGARDING THE \u201cOPIOID  EPIDEMIC\u201d HAS FOCUSED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF NALOXONE, AN OPIOID ANTAGONIST USED FOR ACUTE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS,  SO-CALLED \u201cNON-ABUSEABLE\u201d OPIOID FORMULATIONS, AS WELL AS ON MEANS OF REDUCING OPIOID CONSUMPTION BY LIMITING PRODUCTION  OF OPIOIDS AND ACCESS TO LEGAL OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THESE APPROACHES WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE  SITUATION. NEVERTHELESS, AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN ONGOING INDUSTRY-WIDE PULLBACK FROM OPIOIDS, AS EVIDENCED BY  A REDUCTION IN OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS AND A MAJOR REDUCTION IN MANUFACTURING BY TWO OF THE LARGEST OPIOID MANUFACTURES IN THE UNITED  STATES.  THESE  FACTORS HAVE MADE IT DIFFICULT TO RAISE CAPITAL OR FIND STRATEGIC PARTNERS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AMPAKINES FOR THE TREATMENT  OF OPIOID INDUCED RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND WE ARE ASSESSING WHETHER TO CONTINUE WITH THIS PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, AS NOTED  ABOVE, WE HAVE DECIDED NOT TO ENTER INTO A NEW LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH TEC EDMONTON AT THIS TIME AND ARE SUSPENDING THE DEVELOPMENT  OF THIS PROGRAM UNTIL THE POLITICAL CLIMATE IS CLARIFIED AND WE ARE ABLE TO EITHER RAISE FUNDING OR ENTER INTO A STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP  FOR THIS PURPOSE. NEVERTHELESS, THE VALUABLE DATA DERIVED FROM THESE TRANSLATIONAL  STUDIES HAVE ESTABLISHED ANTAGONISM OF OIRD AS A BIOMARKER FOR DEMONSTRATING PROOF OF PRINCIPLE AND TARGET ENGAGEMENT IN SUPPORT  OF CONTINUED AMPAKINE DEVELOPMENT FOR OTHER INDICATIONS.  IN  ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS PURSUING POTENTIALLY PROMISING CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS IN NEURO-BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE DISORDERS,  WITH TRANSLATIONAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON THE USE OF AMPAKINES FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADHD AND, TOGETHER WITH  OUR ACADEMIC COLLABORATORS, FOR MOTOR IMPAIRMENT RESULTING FROM SCI AND FOR FRAGILE X AUTISM.  ADHD  IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON NEUROBEHAVIORAL DISORDERS, WITH 6.1% OF AMERICAN CHILDREN TAKING MEDICATION FOR TREATMENT, AND ADHD  IS ESTIMATED TO AFFECT 7.8% OF U.S. CHILDREN AGED 4 TO 17 ACCORDING TO THE U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (\u201cCDC\u201d),  OR APPROXIMATELY 4.5 MILLION CHILDREN. THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ADHD ARE INATTENTION, HYPERACTIVITY AND IMPULSIVITY. ADHD  SYMPTOMS ARE KNOWN TO PERSIST INTO ADULTHOOD. IN A STUDY PUBLISHED IN  PSYCHIATRY RES IN MAY 2010,  UP TO 78% OF CHILDREN  AFFECTED BY THIS DISORDER SHOWED AT LEAST ONE OF THE MAJOR SYMPTOMS OF ADHD WHEN FOLLOWED UP 10 YEARS LATER. ACCORDING TO THE  CDC, APPROXIMATELY 4% OF THE US ADULT POPULATION HAS ADHD, WHICH CAN NEGATIVELY IMPAIR MANY ASPECTS OF DAILY LIFE, INCLUDING HOME,  SCHOOL, WORK AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.  CURRENTLY  AVAILABLE TREATMENTS FOR ADHD INCLUDE AMPHETAMINE-TYPE STIMULANTS AND NON-STIMULANT AGENTS TARGETING THE MONOAMINERGIC RECEPTOR  SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN. HOWEVER, THESE RECEPTORS ARE NOT RESTRICTED TO THE BRAIN AND ARE WIDELY FOUND THROUGHOUT THE BODY. THUS,  WHILE THESE AGENTS CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN AMELIORATING ADHD SYMPTOMS, THEY ALSO CAN PRODUCE ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS, SUCH  AS INCREASED HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE. EXISTING TREATMENTS ALSO AFFECT EATING HABITS AND CAN REDUCE WEIGHT GAIN AND GROWTH  IN CHILDREN AND HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH SUICIDAL IDEATION IN ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS. IN ADDITION, APPROVED STIMULANT TREATMENTS  ARE DEA CLASSIFIED AS CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND PRESENT LOGISTICAL ISSUES FOR DISTRIBUTION AND PROTECTION FROM DIVERSION. APPROVED  NON-STIMULANT TREATMENTS, SUCH AS ATOMOXETINE, CAN TAKE FOUR TO EIGHT WEEKS TO BECOME EFFECTIVE AND UNDESIRABLE SIDE EFFECTS HAVE  BEEN OBSERVED.  VARIOUS  INVESTIGATORS HAVE GENERATED DATA SUPPORTING THE CONCEPT THAT ALTERATIONS IN AMPA RECEPTOR FUNCTION MIGHT UNDERLIE THE PRODUCTION  OF SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS OF ADHD. IN RODENT AND PRIMATE MODELS OF COGNITION, AMPAKINES HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO REDUCE INATTENTION  AND IMPULSIVITY, TWO OF THE CARDINAL SYMPTOMS OF ADHD. FURTHERMORE, AMPAKINES DO NOT STIMULATE SPONTANEOUS LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY  IN EITHER MICE OR RATS, UNLIKE THE STIMULANTS PRESENTLY USED FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADHD, NOR DO THEY INCREASE THE STIMULATION PRODUCED  BY AMPHETAMINE OR COCAINE. THESE PRECLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS PROMPTED US TO CONDUCT A RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE- BLIND, PLACEBO CONTROLLED,  TWO PERIOD CROSSOVER STUDY TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF CX717 IN ADULTS WITH ADHD.  35  IN  A REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS, A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT TREATMENT EFFECT ON ADHD RATING SCALE (ADHD-RS), THE PRIMARY OUTCOME  MEASURE, WAS OBSERVED AFTER A THREE-WEEK ADMINISTRATION OF CX717, 800 MG BID. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS DOSE OF CX717 AND PLACEBO  WERE SEEN AS EARLY AS WEEK ONE OF TREATMENT AND CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE STUDY. THE LOW DOSE OF CX717, 200 MG  BID, DID NOT DIFFER FROM PLACEBO. IN GENERAL, RESULTS FROM BOTH THE ADHD-RS HYPERACTIVITY AND INATTENTIVENESS SUBSCALES, WHICH  WERE SECONDARY EFFICACY VARIABLES, PARALLELED THE RESULTS OF THE TOTAL SCORE. CX717 WAS CONSIDERED SAFE AND WELL TOLERATED.  BASED  ON THESE CLINICAL RESULTS, AMPAKINES SUCH AS CX717 MIGHT REPRESENT A BREAKTHROUGH OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A NON- STIMULATING THERAPEUTIC  FOR ADHD WITH THE RAPIDITY OF ONSET NORMALLY SEEN WITH STIMULANTS. SUBJECT TO RAISING SUFFICIENT FINANCING (OF WHICH NO ASSURANCE  CAN BE PROVIDED), WE ARE PLANNING TO CONTINUE THIS PROGRAM WITH A PHASE 2B CLINICAL TRIAL IN PATIENTS WITH ADULT ADHD.  AMPAKINES  ALSO MAY HAVE POTENTIAL UTILITY IN THE TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF SCI TO ENHANCE MOTOR FUNCTIONS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE  FOR SCI PATIENTS. AN ESTIMATED 17,000 NEW CASES OF SCI OCCUR EACH YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES, MOST A RESULT OF AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS.  CURRENTLY, THERE ARE ROUGHLY 282,000 PEOPLE LIVING WITH SPINAL CORD INJURIES, WHICH OFTEN PRODUCE IMPAIRED MOTOR FUNCTION.  SCI  CAN PROFOUNDLY IMPAIR NEURAL PLASTICITY LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN HUMAN ACCIDENT VICTIMS. PLASTICITY IS  A FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT ENABLES CONTINUOUS ALTERATION OF NEURAL PATHWAYS AND SYNAPSES IN RESPONSE TO  EXPERIENCE OR INJURY. ONE FREQUENTLY STUDIED MODEL OF PLASTICITY IS LONG-TERM FACILITATION OF MOTOR NERVE OUTPUT (\u201cLTF\u201d).  A LARGE BODY OF LITERATURE EXISTS REGARDING THE ABILITY OF AMPAKINES TO STIMULATE NEURAL PLASTICITY, POSSIBLY DUE TO AN ENHANCED  SYNTHESIS AND SECRETION OF VARIOUS GROWTH FACTORS.  RECENTLY,  STUDIES OF ACUTE INTERMITTENT HYPOXIA (\u201cAIH\u201d) IN PATIENTS WITH SCI DEMONSTRATE THAT NEURAL PLASTICITY CAN BE INDUCED  TO IMPROVE MOTOR FUNCTION. THIS LTF IS BASED ON PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABILITY OF SPINAL CIRCUITRY TO LEARN  HOW TO ADJUST SPINAL AND BRAINSTEM SYNAPTIC STRENGTH FOLLOWING REPEATED HYPOXIC BOUTS. BECAUSE AIH INDUCES SPINAL PLASTICITY,  THE POTENTIAL EXISTS TO HARNESS REPETITIVE AIH AS A MEANS OF INDUCING FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY OF MOTOR FUNCTION FOLLOWING SCI.  RESPIRERX  HAS BEEN WORKING WITH DR. DAVID FULLER, AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA WITH FUNDING FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, TO EVALUATE  THE USE OF AMPAKINES FOR THE TREATMENT OF COMPROMISED MOTOR FUNCTION IN SCI. USING MICE THAT HAVE RECEIVED SPINAL HEMISECTIONS,  CX717 WAS OBSERVED TO INCREASE MOTOR NERVE ACTIVITY BILATERALLY. THE EFFECT ON THE HEMISECTED SIDE WAS GREATER THAN THAT MEASURED  ON THE INTACT SIDE, WITH THE RECOVERY APPROXIMATING THAT SEEN ON THE INTACT SIDE PRIOR TO ADMINISTRATION OF AMPAKINE. IN ADDITION,  CX717 WAS OBSERVED TO PRODUCE A DRAMATIC AND LONG-LASTING EFFECT ON LTF PRODUCED BY AIH. THE DOSES OF AMPAKINES ACTIVE IN SCI  WERE COMPARABLE TO THOSE DEMONSTRATING ANTAGONISM OF OIRD, INDICATING TARGET ENGAGEMENT OF THE AMPA RECEPTORS.  THESE  ANIMAL MODELS OF MOTOR NERVE FUNCTION FOLLOWING SCI SUPPORT PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR A NEW TREATMENT PARADIGM USING AMPAKINES TO IMPROVE  MOTOR FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH SCI. WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING RECENTLY GRANTED BY NIH TO DR. FULLER, RESPIRERX IS CONTINUING ITS  COLLABORATIVE PRECLINICAL RESEARCH WITH DR. FULLER WHILE IT IS PLANNING A CLINICAL TRIAL PROGRAM FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING AMPAKINES  FOR THE RESTORATION OF CERTAIN MOTOR FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH SCI. THE COMPANY IS WORKING WITH OUR CLINICAL ADVISORY PANEL AND  WITH RESEARCHERS AT HIGHLY REGARDED CLINICAL SITES TO FINALIZE A PHASE 2 CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL. WE BELIEVE THAT A CLINICAL STUDY  COULD BE INITIATED WITHIN SEVERAL MONTHS OF RAISING SUFFICIENT FINANCING. CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT HAVE A SOURCE OF SUCH FINANCING  AND WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE SUFFICIENT FUNDING.  ACCORDING  TO THE AUTISM SOCIETY, MORE THAN 3.5 MILLION AMERICANS LIVE WITH AN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (\u201cASD\u201d), A COMPLEX NEURODEVELOPMENTAL  DISORDER. FRAGILE X SYNDROME (\u201cFXS\u201d) IS THE MOST COMMON IDENTIFIABLE SINGLE-GENE CAUSE OF AUTISM, AFFECTING APPROXIMATELY  1.4 IN EVERY 10,000 MALES AND 0.9 IN EVERY 10,000 FEMALES, ACCORDING TO THE CDC. INDIVIDUALS WITH FXS AND ASD EXHIBIT A RANGE  OF ABNORMAL BEHAVIORS COMPRISING HYPERACTIVITY AND ATTENTION PROBLEMS, EXECUTIVE FUNCTION DEFICITS, HYPER- REACTIVITY TO STIMULI,  ANXIETY AND MOOD INSTABILITY. ALSO, ACCORDING THE AUTISM SOCIETY, THE PREVALENCE RATE OF ASD HAS RISEN FROM 1 IN 150 CHILDREN  IN 2000 TO 1 IN 68 CHILDREN IN 2010, WITH CURRENT ESTIMATES INDICATING A SIGNIFICANT RISE IN ASD DIAGNOSIS TO 1 IN 59 BIRTHS,  PLACING A SIGNIFICANT EMOTIONAL AND ECONOMIC BURDEN ON FAMILIES AND EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS. THE AUTISM SOCIETY ESTIMATES THE ECONOMIC  COST TO U.S. CITIZENS OF AUTISM SERVICES TO BE BETWEEN $236 AND $262 BILLION ANNUALLY.  36  SINCE  \u201cAUTISTIC DISTURBANCES\u201d WERE FIRST IDENTIFIED IN CHILDREN IN 1943, EXTENSIVE RESEARCH EFFORTS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO IDENTIFY  THE GENETIC, MOLECULAR, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND CLINICAL CAUSES OF ASD, BUT UNTIL RECENTLY THE UNDERLYING ETIOLOGY OF THE DISORDER  REMAINED ELUSIVE. TODAY, THERE ARE NO MEDICATIONS THAT CAN TREAT ASD OR ITS CORE SYMPTOMS, AND ONLY TWO ANTI-PSYCHOTIC DRUGS,  ARIPIPRAZOLE AND RISPERIDONE, ARE APPROVED BY THE UNITED STATES FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) FOR THE TREATMENT  OF IRRITABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH ASD.  THANKS  TO WIDE RANGING TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH EFFORTS, FXS AND ASD ARE CURRENTLY RECOGNIZED AS DISORDERS OF THE SYNAPSE WITH ALTERATIONS  IN DIFFERENT FORMS OF SYNAPTIC COMMUNICATION AND NEURONAL NETWORK CONNECTIVITY. FOCUSING ON THE PROTEINS AND SUBUNITS OF THE AMPA  RECEPTOR COMPLEX, AUTISM RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO (\u201cUCSD\u201d) HAVE PROPOSED THAT AMPA RECEPTOR MALFUNCTION  AND DISRUPTED GLUTAMATE SIGNAL TRANSMISSION MAY PLAY AN ETIOLOGIC ROLE IN THE BEHAVIORAL, EMOTIONAL AND NEUROCOGNITIVE PHENOTYPES  THAT REMAIN THE STANDARD FOR ASD DIAGNOSIS. FOR EXAMPLE, STARGAZIN, ALSO KNOWN AS CACNG2 (CA2+ CHANNEL \u03932 SUBUNIT), IS ONE  OF FOUR CLOSELY RELATED PROTEINS RECENTLY CATEGORIZED AS TRANSMEMBRANE AMPA RECEPTOR REGULATING PROTEINS (\u201cTARPS\u201d).  RESEARCHERS  AT UCSD HAVE BEEN STUDYING GENETIC MUTATIONS IN THE AMPA RECEPTOR COMPLEX THAT LEAD TO COGNITIVE AND FUNCTIONAL DEFICIENCIES ALONG  THE AUTISM SPECTRUM. THEY WORK WITH PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO CONDUCT DETAILED GENETIC ANALYSES IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND  THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF AUTISM. IN ONE CASE, THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH A TEENAGE PATIENT WHO HAS AN AUTISM DIAGNOSIS, WITH  A PHENOTYPE THAT IS CHARACTERIZED BY SUBTLE TOURETTE-LIKE BEHAVIORS, EXTREME AGGRESSION, AND VERBAL AND PHYSICAL OUTBURSTS WITH  DISORDERED THOUGHT. DESPITE THE BEHAVIORS, HIS LANGUAGE IS NORMAL. USING NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING AND GENOME EDITING TECHNOLOGIES,  THE RESEARCHERS IDENTIFIED A SPECIFIC MUTATION IN STARGAZIN THAT ALTERS THE CONFIGURATION AND KINETICS OF THE AMPA RECEPTOR. WHEN  THE ABERRANT SEQUENCE WAS INTRODUCED INTO C57BL6 MICE USING CRISPR (CLUSTERED REGULATORY INTERSPACED SHORT PALINDROMIC REPEATS),  THE HETEROZYGOUS ALLELE HAD A DOMINANT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE TRAFFICKING OF POST-SYNAPTIC AMPA RECEPTORS AND PRODUCED BEHAVIORS  CONSISTENT WITH A GLUTAMATERGIC DEFICIT AND SIMILAR TO WHAT HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN THE TEENAGE PATIENT.  WITH  FUNDING FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH TO UCSD, RESPIRERX IS WORKING WITH UCSD TO EXPLORE THE USE OF AMPAKINES FOR THE  AMELIORATION OF THE COGNITIVE AND OTHER DEFICITS ASSOCIATED WITH AMPA RECEPTOR GENE MUTATIONS. BECAUSE CX1739 HAS AN OPEN INVESTIGATIONAL  NEW DRUG (\u201cIND\u201d) APPLICATION, SUBJECT TO SECURING SUFFICIENT OUTSIDE FUNDING (OF WHICH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED),  WE ARE CONSIDERING A PHASE 2A CLINICAL TRIAL LATE IN 2019.  CANNABINOIDS  OSA  IS A SLEEP-RELATED BREATHING DISORDER THAT AFFLICTS AN ESTIMATED 29 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN  ACADEMY OF SLEEP MEDICINE (\u201cAASM\u201d), AND AN ADDITIONAL 26 MILLION IN GERMANY AND 8 MILLION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, AS  PRESENTED AT THE EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY SOCIETY\u2019S (\u201cERS\u201d) ANNUAL CONGRESS IN PARIS, FRANCE IN SEPTEMBER 2018.  OSA INVOLVES A DECREASE OR COMPLETE HALT IN AIRFLOW DESPITE AN ONGOING EFFORT TO BREATHE DURING SLEEP. WHEN THE MUSCLES RELAX  DURING SLEEP, SOFT TISSUE IN THE BACK OF THE THROAT COLLAPSES AND OBSTRUCTS THE UPPER AIRWAY. OSA REMAINS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER-RECOGNIZED,  AS ONLY 20% OF CASES IN THE UNITED STATES ACCORDING TO THE AASM AND 20% OF CASES GLOBALLY HAVE BEEN PROPERLY DIAGNOSED. ABOUT  24 PERCENT OF ADULT MEN AND 9 PERCENT OF ADULT WOMEN HAVE THE BREATHING SYMPTOMS OF OSA WITH OR WITHOUT DAYTIME SLEEPINESS. OSA  SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS THE LIVES OF SUFFERERS WHO DO NOT GET ENOUGH SLEEP; THEIR QUALITY OF SLEEP IS DETERIORATED SUCH THAT DAILY  FUNCTION IS COMPROMISED AND LIMITED. OSA IS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED QUALITY OF LIFE, SIGNIFICANT FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT, AND  INCREASED RISK OF ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS, ESPECIALLY IN PROFESSIONS LIKE TRANSPORTATION AND SHIPPING.  RESEARCH  HAS ESTABLISHED LINKS BETWEEN OSA AND SEVERAL IMPORTANT CO-MORBIDITIES, INCLUDING HYPERTENSION, TYPE II DIABETES, OBESITY, STROKE,  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS, AND EVEN EARLY MORTALITY. THE CONSEQUENCES OF UNDIAGNOSED  AND UNTREATED OSA ARE MEDICALLY SERIOUS AND ECONOMICALLY COSTLY. ACCORDING TO THE AASM, THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC BURDEN OF OSA IN  THE UNITED STATES IS APPROXIMATELY $162 BILLION ANNUALLY. WE BELIEVE THAT A NEW DRUG THERAPY THAT IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE  MEDICAL AND ECONOMIC BURDEN OF OSA WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES FOR OPTIMAL PRICING IN THIS COSTLY DISEASE INDICATION.  37  CONTINUOUS  POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE (\u201cCPAP\u201d) IS THE MOST COMMON TREATMENT FOR OSA. CPAP DEVICES WORK BY BLOWING PRESSURIZED AIR  INTO THE NOSE (OR MOUTH AND NOSE), WHICH KEEPS THE PHARYNGEAL AIRWAY OPEN. CPAP IS NOT CURATIVE, AND PATIENTS MUST USE THE MASK  WHENEVER THEY SLEEP. REDUCTION OF THE APNEA/HYPOPNEA INDEX (\u201cAHI\u201d) IS THE STANDARD OBJECTIVE MEASURE OF THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE IN OSA. APNEA IS THE CESSATION OF BREATHING FOR 10 SECONDS OR MORE AND HYPONEA IS A REDUCTION IN BREATHING. AHI IS THE  SUM OF APNEA AND HYPOPNEA EVENTS PER HOUR. IN THE SLEEP LABORATORY, CPAP IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING THE AHI. HOWEVER, THE  DEVICE IS CUMBERSOME AND DIFFICULT FOR MANY PATIENTS TO TOLERATE. MOST STUDIES DESCRIBE THAT 25-50% OF PATIENTS REFUSE TO INITIATE  OR COMPLETELY DISCONTINUE CPAP USE WITHIN THE FIRST SEVERAL MONTHS AND THAT MOST PATIENTS WHO CONTINUE TO USE THE DEVICE DO SO  ONLY INTERMITTENTLY.  ORAL  DEVICES MAY BE AN OPTION FOR PATIENTS WHO CANNOT TOLERATE CPAP. SEVERAL DENTAL DEVICES ARE AVAILABLE INCLUDING THE MANDIBULAR  ADVANCEMENT DEVICE (\u201cMAD\u201d) AND THE TONGUE RETAINING DEVICE (\u201cTRD\u201d). THE MAD IS THE MOST WIDELY USED DENTAL  DEVICE FOR SLEEP APNEA AND IS SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE TO A SPORTS MOUTH GUARD. IT FORCES THE LOWER JAW FORWARD AND DOWN SLIGHTLY  WHICH KEEPS THE AIRWAY MORE OPEN. THE TRD IS A SPLINT THAT HOLDS THE TONGUE IN PLACE TO KEEP THE AIRWAY AS OPEN AS POSSIBLE. LIKE  CPAP, ORAL DEVICES ARE NOT CURATIVE FOR PATIENTS WITH OSA. THE COST OF THESE DEVICES TENDS TO BE HIGH AND SIDE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED  WITH THEM INCLUDE NIGHT TIME PAIN, DRY LIPS, TOOTH DISCOMFORT, AND EXCESSIVE SALIVATION.  PATIENTS  WITH CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT OSA WHO CANNOT BE TREATED ADEQUATELY WITH CPAP OR ORAL DEVICES CAN ELECT TO UNDERGO SURGERY. THE MOST  COMMON SURGERY IS UVULOPALATOPHARYNGOPLASTY WHICH INVOLVES THE REMOVAL OF EXCESS TISSUE IN THE THROAT TO MAKE THE AIRWAY WIDER.  OTHER POSSIBLE SURGERIES INCLUDE TRACHEOSTOMIES, REBUILDING OF THE LOWER JAW, AND NOSE SURGERY. PATIENTS WHO UNDERGO SURGERY FOR  THE TREATMENT OF OSA RISK COMPLICATIONS, INCLUDING INFECTION, CHANGES IN VOICE FREQUENCY, AND IMPAIRED SENSE OF SMELL. SURGERY  IS OFTEN UNSUCCESSFUL AND, AT PRESENT, NO METHOD EXISTS TO RELIABLY PREDICT THERAPEUTIC OUTCOME FROM THESE FORMS OF OSA SURGERY.  RECENTLY,  ANOTHER SURGICAL OPTION HAS BECOME AVAILABLE BASED ON UPPER AIRWAY STIMULATION. IT IS A COMBINATION OF AN IMPLANTABLE NERVE STIMULATOR  AND AN EXTERNAL REMOTE CONTROLLED BY THE PATIENT. THE HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE IS A MOTOR NERVE THAT CONTROLS THE TONGUE. THE IMPLANTED  DEVICE STIMULATES THE NERVE WITH EVERY ATTEMPTED BREATH, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH STIMULATION IS NEEDED FOR THAT BREATH, TO  INCREASE MUSCLE TONE TO PREVENT THE TONGUE AND OTHER SOFT TISSUES FROM COLLAPSING. THE SURGICALLY IMPLANTED DEVICE IS TURNED ON  AT NIGHT AND OFF IN THE MORNING BY THE PATIENT WITH THE REMOTE.  THE  POOR TOLERANCE AND LONG-TERM ADHERENCE TO CPAP, AS WELL AS THE LIMITATIONS OF MECHANICAL DEVICES AND SURGERY, MAKE DISCOVERY OF  THERAPEUTIC ALTERNATIVES CLINICALLY RELEVANT AND IMPORTANT. RESPIRERX\u2019S TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT  DRONABINOL, A SYNTHETIC CANNABINOID, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME THE FIRST DRUG TREATMENT FOR THIS LARGE AND UNDERSERVED MARKET.  IN  ORDER TO EXPAND RESPIRERX\u2019S RESPIRATORY DISORDERS PROGRAM AND DEVELOP CERTAIN COMPOUNDS REFERRED TO AS CANNABINOIDS FOR  THE TREATMENT OF OSA, RESPIRERX ACQUIRED 100% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING EQUITY SECURITIES OF PIER PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. (\u201cPIER\u201d)  EFFECTIVE AUGUST 10, 2012 PURSUANT TO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER. PIER HAD BEEN FORMED IN JUNE 2007 (UNDER THE NAME STEADYSLEEP  RX CO.) AS A CLINICAL STAGE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY TO DEVELOP A PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT FOR OSA AND HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN RESEARCH  AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.  THROUGH  THE MERGER, RESPIRERX GAINED ACCESS TO AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT (AS AMENDED, THE \u201cOLD LICENSE AGREEMENT\u201d) THAT  PIER HAD ENTERED INTO WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO (THE \u201cUIC\u201d) ON OCTOBER 10, 2007. THE OLD LICENSE  AGREEMENT COVERED CERTAIN PATENTS AND PATENT APPLICATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES CLAIMING THE USE OF CANNABINOIDS,  OF WHICH DRONABINOL IS A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE, FOR THE TREATMENT OF SLEEP-RELATED BREATHING DISORDERS (INCLUDING SLEEP APNEA). PIER\u2019S  BUSINESS PLAN WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER DRONABINOL WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE CLINICAL MEASURES IN PATIENTS  WITH OSA.  THE  OLD LICENSE AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED EFFECTIVE MARCH 21, 2013 AND THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NEW LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE \u201c2014  LICENSE AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH THE UIC ON JUNE 27, 2014, THE MATERIAL TERMS OF WHICH WERE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE OLD LICENSE  AGREEMENT. THE 2014 LICENSE AGREEMENT GRANTS THE COMPANY, AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS, EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS: (I) TO PRACTICE CERTAIN PATENTS  IN THE UNITED STATES, GERMANY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, AS DEFINED IN THE 2014 LICENSE AGREEMENT, THAT ARE HELD BY THE UIC; (II)  TO IDENTIFY, DEVELOP, MAKE, HAVE MADE, IMPORT, EXPORT, LEASE, SELL, HAVE SOLD OR OFFER FOR SALE ANY RELATED LICENSED PRODUCTS;  AND (III) TO GRANT SUB-LICENSES OF THE RIGHTS GRANTED IN THE 2014 LICENSE AGREEMENT, SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE 2014 LICENSE  AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED UNDER THE 2014 LICENSE AGREEMENT, AMONG OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS, TO PAY THE UIC A LICENSE  FEE, ROYALTIES, PATENT COSTS AND CERTAIN MILESTONE PAYMENTS.  38  DRONABINOL  IS A SYNTHETIC DERIVATIVE OF \u03949-THC, ONE OF THE PHARMACOLOGICALLY ACTIVE SUBSTANCES NATURALLY OCCURRING IN THE CANNABIS  PLANT. DRONABINOL IS A SCHEDULE III, CONTROLLED GENERIC DRUG THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR THE TREATMENT OF AIDS- RELATED  ANOREXIA AND CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING. DRONABINOL IS AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES AS THE BRANDED PRESCRIPTION  DRUG PRODUCT MARINOL\u00ae CAPSULES. MARINOL\u00ae, TOGETHER WITH NUMEROUS GENERIC FORMULATIONS, IS AVAILABLE IN 2.5, 5, AND 10  MG CAPSULES, WITH A MAXIMUM LABELLED DOSAGE OF 20 MG/DAY FOR THE AIDS INDICATION, OR 15 MG/M2 PER DOSE FOR CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED  NAUSEA AND VOMITING.  THE  COMPANY CONDUCTED A 21-DAY, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, DOSE ESCALATION PHASE 2A CLINICAL STUDY IN 22 PATIENTS  WITH OSA, IN WHICH DRONABINOL PRODUCED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN AHI, THE PRIMARY THERAPEUTIC END-POINT, AND WAS  OBSERVED TO BE SAFE AND WELL TOLERATED, WITH THE FREQUENCY OF SIDE EFFECTS NO DIFFERENT FROM PLACEBO (PRASAD  ET AL, FRONTIERS  IN PSYCHIATRY  , 2013). THIS CLINICAL TRIAL PROVIDED DATA ALLOWING FOR THE SUBMISSION OF PATENT APPLICATIONS CLAIMING UNIQUE  DOSAGE STRENGTHS AND CONTROLLED RELEASE FORMULATIONS OPTIMIZED FOR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF OSA. IF APPROVED, THESE PENDING PATENTS  WOULD EXTEND MARKET EXCLUSIVITY UNTIL 2036.  WITH  APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION IN FUNDING FROM THE NATIONAL HEART, LUNG AND BLOOD INSTITUTE OF NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (\u201cNIH\u201d),  DR. DAVID CARLEY OF UIC, ALONG WITH HIS COLLEAGUES AT UIC AND NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY, RECENTLY COMPLETED A PHASE 2B MULTI-CENTER,  DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL OF DRONABINOL IN PATIENTS WITH OSA. ENTITLED PHARMACOTHERAPY OF APNEA WITH CANNABIMIMETIC  ENHANCEMENT (\u201cPACE\u201d), THIS STUDY REPLICATED THE EARLIER PHASE 2A STUDY. THE AUTHORS REPORTED (CARLEY  ET AL  ,  SLEEP  , 2018) THAT, IN A DOSE DEPENDENT FASHION, TREATMENT WITH 2.5MG AND 10MG OF DRONABINOL ONCE A DAY AT NIGHT, SIGNIFICANTLY  REDUCED, COMPARED TO PLACEBO, THE AHI DURING SLEEP IN 56 EVALUABLE PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE OSA WHO COMPLETED THE STUDY.  ADDITIONALLY, TREATMENT WITH 10MG OF DRONABINOL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED DAYTIME SLEEPINESS AS MEASURED BY THE EPWORTH SLEEPINESS  SCALE AND ACHIEVED THE GREATEST OVERALL PATIENT SATISFACTION. AS IN THE PREVIOUS STUDY, DRONABINOL WAS OBSERVED TO BE SAFE AND  WELL TOLERATED, WITH THE FREQUENCY OF SIDE EFFECTS NO DIFFERENT FROM PLACEBO. THE COMPANY DID NOT MANAGE OR FUND THIS CLINICAL  TRIAL WHICH WAS FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL HEART, LUNG AND BLOOD INSTITUTE OF NIH.  THE  USE OF DRONABINOL FOR THE TREATMENT OF OSA IS A NOVEL INDICATION FOR AN ALREADY APPROVED DRUG AND, AS SUCH, THE COMPANY BELIEVES  THAT IT WOULD ALLOW US OR A DEVELOPMENT PARTNER TO SUBMIT A 505(B)(2) NEW DRUG APPLICATION (\u201cNDA\u201d) TO THE FDA FOR  APPROVAL OF A NEW DRONABINOL LABEL, AS OPPOSED TO THE SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL OF A FULL 505(B)(1) NDA. THE 505(B)(2) NDA WAS CREATED  BY THE HATCH-WAXMAN AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG AND COSMETIC ACT, IN PART, TO HELP AVOID UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION OF STUDIES  ALREADY PERFORMED ON A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED DRUG; THE SECTION GIVES THE FDA EXPRESS PERMISSION TO RELY ON DATA NOT DEVELOPED BY  THE NDA APPLICANT. A 505(B)(2) NDA CONTAINS FULL SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS REPORTS BUT ALLOWS AT LEAST SOME OF THE INFORMATION  REQUIRED FOR NDA APPROVAL, SUCH AS SAFETY AND EFFICACY INFORMATION ON THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT, TO COME FROM STUDIES NOT CONDUCTED  BY OR FOR THE APPLICANT. THIS CAN RESULT IN A LESS EXPENSIVE AND FASTER ROUTE TO APPROVAL, COMPARED WITH A TRADITIONAL DEVELOPMENT  PATH, SUCH AS 505(B)(1), WHILE CREATING NEW, DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS. THIS REGULATORY PATH OFFERS MARKET PROTECTIONS UNDER HATCH-WAXMAN  PROVISIONS FOR MARKET EXCLUSIVITY AT THE FDA. OTHER REGULATORY ROUTES ARE AVAILABLE TO PURSUE PROPRIETARY FORMULATIONS OF DRONABINOL  THAT WILL PROVIDE FURTHER MARKET PROTECTIONS. IN EUROPE, A REGULATORY APPROVAL ROUTE SIMILAR TO THE 505(B)(2) PATHWAY IS THE HYBRID  PROCEDURE BASED ON ARTICLE 10 OF DIRECTIVE 2001/83/EC.  IN  CONJUNCTION WITH ITS MANAGEMENT AND CONSULTANTS, RESPIRERX HAS DEVELOPED A REGULATORY STRATEGY IN WHICH WE INTEND TO FILE A NEW  NDA UNDER SECTION 505(B)(2) CLAIMING THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF OUR PROPOSED PROPRIETARY DRONABINOL FORMULATION IN THE TREATMENT  OF OSA. WE HAVE ENGAGED CAMARGO PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES, LLC TO ACT AS REGULATORY CONSULTANTS AND ASSIST WITH FDA FILINGS AND  REGULATORY STRATEGY. IF WE CAN SECURE SUFFICIENT FINANCING, OF WHICH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED, WE ANTICIPATE REQUESTING A  PRE-IND MEETING WITH THE FDA. THIS MEETING ALSO COULD CREATE THE TYPE OF DIALOGUE WITH THE FDA THAT IS NORMALLY COMMUNICATED AT  AN END-OF PHASE 2 MEETING. THE FDA RESPONSES TO THIS MEETING WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO AN IND, WHICH WE BELIEVE WE COULD BE IN  A POSITION TO SUBMIT WITHIN 60 DAYS OF RECEIVING THEIR COMMUNICATION.  UNLIKE  A STANDARD 505(B)(1) NDA, THE 505(B)(2) PROCESS BEGINS WITH A PRE-IND MEETING WITH THE FDA, THEN MOVES TO FORMULATION DEVELOPMENT  (AND NONCLINICAL STUDIES, IF NECESSARY) AND THEN TO THE IND (INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG) FILING. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRE-IND MEETING  WILL INVOLVE DISCUSSIONS OF FORMULATION AND SAFETY, AS WELL AS CERTAIN REQUIRED CLINICAL TRIALS. IF WE CAN SECURE SUFFICIENT FINANCING,  OF WHICH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED, WE PLAN TO PROPOSE CONDUCTING A CLINICAL STUDY WITH OUR PROPRIETARY CONTROLLED RELEASE  FORMULATION IN OSA PATIENTS TO DETERMINE SAFETY, PHARMACOKINETICS AND EFFICACY. IN ADDITION, IF WE SECURE SUFFICIENT FUNDING,  WE INTEND TO PROPOSE A STANDARD PHASE 1 CLINICAL STUDY TO DETERMINE POTENTIAL ABUSE LIABILITY. WHEN A PHASE 3 STUDY IS REQUIRED  FOR A 505(B)(2), USUALLY ONLY ONE STUDY WITH FEWER PATIENTS IS NECESSARY VERSUS THE TWO, LARGE SCALE, CONFIRMATORY STUDIES GENERALLY  REQUIRED FOR 505(B)(1). WHILE NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED, WITH AN EXTENSIVE SAFETY DATABASE TRACKING CHRONIC, LONG-TERM USE  OF MARINOL\u00ae AND GENERICS, WE BELIEVE THAT FDA SHOULD NOT HAVE MAJOR SAFETY CONCERNS WITH DRONABINOL IN THE TREATMENT OF OSA.  39  RESPIRERX  HAS WORKED WITH THE PACE INVESTIGATORS AND STAFF, AS WELL AS WITH OUR CLINICAL ADVISORY PANEL TO DESIGN A PHASE 3 PROTOCOL THAT,  BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS FROM THE PHASE 2A AND PHASE 2B TRIALS, WE BELIEVE WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT DATA FOR FDA APPROVAL  OF A RESPIRERX DRONABINOL CONTROLLED RELEASE FORMULATION FOR OSA. THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE PROTOCOL IS DESIGNED AS A 90-DAY  RANDOMIZED, BLINDED, PLACEBO CONTROLLED STUDY OF DRONABINOL IN THE TREATMENT OF OSA. DEPENDING ON FEEDBACK FROM THE FDA, RESPIRERX  ESTIMATES THAT THE PHASE 3 TRIAL WOULD REQUIRE BETWEEN 120 AND 300 PATIENTS AT 15 TO 20 SITES, AND TAKE 18 TO 24 MONTHS TO COMPLETE,  AT A COST OF BETWEEN $10 MILLION AND $14 MILLION. SUBJECT TO RAISING SUFFICIENT FINANCING, OF WHICH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED,  RESPIRERX INTENDS TO SUBMIT THE PHASE 3 PROTOCOL TO THE FDA.  SUBJECT  TO RAISING SUFFICIENT FINANCING (OF WHICH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED), RESPIRERX INTENDS TO HIRE CLINILABS DRUG DEVELOPMENT  CORPORATION, A FULL-SERVICE CRO, TO CONSULT AND POTENTIALLY PROVIDE CLINICAL SITE MANAGEMENT, MONITORING, DATA MANAGEMENT, AND  CENTRALIZED SLEEP MONITORING SERVICES FOR THE PHASE 3 OSA TRIAL. DR. GARY ZAMMITT, CEO OF CLINILABS, SERVES ON THE RESPIRERX CLINICAL  ADVISORY PANEL, AND HIS MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS PROVIDED GUIDANCE ON STUDY DESIGN AND CNS DRUG DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL BE RELEVANT FOR  THE PHASE 3 PROGRAM. FOR EXAMPLE, CLINILABS OFFERS SPECIALIZED CLINICAL TRIAL SERVICES FOR CNS DRUG DEVELOPMENT THROUGH AN ALLIANCE  WITH NEUROCLINICS, INCLUDING CLINICAL TRIALS EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF DRUGS ON DRIVING, COGNITIVE EFFECTS OF FOOD AND (MEDICINAL)  DRUGS, AND SLEEP AND SLEEP DISORDERED BREATHING.  ON  SEPTEMBER 4, 2018, RESPIRERX ENTERED INTO A DRONABINOL DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH NORAMCO INC., ONE OF THE WORLD\u2019S  MAJOR DRONABINOL MANUFACTURERS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, NORAMCO AGREED TO (I) PROVIDE ALL OF THE ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL  INGREDIENT (\u201cAPI\u201d) ESTIMATED TO BE NEEDED FOR THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS FOR BOTH THE FIRST- AND SECOND- GENERATION  PRODUCTS (EACH A \u201cPRODUCT\u201d AND COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cPRODUCTS\u201d), THREE VALIDATION BATCHES FOR NDA FILING(S)  AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY FOR THE INITIAL INVENTORY STOCKING FOR THE WHOLESALE AND RETAIL CHANNELS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS,  (II) MAINTAIN OR FILE VALID DRUG MASTER FILES (\u201cDMFS\u201d) WITH THE FDA OR ANY OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND PROVIDE  THE COMPANY WITH ACCESS OR A RIGHT OF REFERENCE LETTER ENTITLING THE COMPANY TO MAKE CONTINUING REFERENCE TO THE DMFS DURING THE  TERM OF THE AGREEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH ANY REGULATORY FILINGS MADE WITH THE FDA BY THE COMPANY, (III) PARTICIPATE ON A DEVELOPMENT  COMMITTEE, AND (IV) MAKE AVAILABLE ITS REGULATORY CONSULTANTS, COLLABORATE WITH ANY REGULATORY CONSULTING FIRMS ENGAGED BY THE  COMPANY AND PARTICIPATE IN ALL FDA OR DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY (\u201cDEA\u201d) MEETINGS AS APPROPRIATE AND AS RELATED TO THE  API.  IN  CONSIDERATION FOR THESE SUPPLIES AND SERVICES, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED (I) TO PURCHASE EXCLUSIVELY FROM NORAMCO, DURING THE COMMERCIALIZATION  PHASE, ALL API FOR ITS PRODUCTS (AS DEFINED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT) AT A PRE-DETERMINED PRICE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN  PRODUCER PRICE ADJUSTMENTS AND (II) NORAMCO\u2019S PARTICIPATION IN THE ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF THE COMMERCIALIZED PRODUCT OR PRODUCTS  UP TO THE EARLIER OF THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A MAXIMUM DOLLAR AMOUNT OR THE EXPIRATION OF A PERIOD OF TIME.  WHILE  WE INITIALLY BELIEVED THAT THE MOST DIRECT ROUTE TO COMMERCIALIZATION WAS TO PROCEED DIRECTLY TO A PHASE 3 PIVOTAL CLINICAL  TRIAL USING THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE DRONABINOL FORMULATION (2.5, 5 AND 10 MG GEL CAPS) AND TO COMMERCIALIZE A RESPIRERX BRANDED  DRONABINOL CAPSULE (\u201cRBDC\u201d) WITH AN NDA, SEVERAL RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HAVE CAUSED US TO RE-EVALUATE THIS APPROACH.  FIRST, IN THE PAST 6 TO 12 MONTHS, NEW FORMULATION TECHNOLOGY HAS EMERGED ALLOWING THE CREATION OF A PROPRIETARY DRONABINOL FORMULATION  WITH POTENTIALLY OPTIMIZED DOSE AND DURATION OF ACTION FOR TREATING OSA. SECOND, DISCUSSIONS IN PROCESS WITH A NUMBER OF FORMULATION  COMPANIES WITH EXISTING DRONABINOL FORMULATION TECHNOLOGIES, EXPERTISE, AND LICENSURE CAPABILITIES MAY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT  OF A PROPRIETARY FORMULATION OF DRONABINOL FOR RESPIRERX BASED ON RESPIRERX\u2019S PENDING PATENTS FOR LOW-DOSE AND EXTENDED  RELEASE DRONABINOL. THIS HAS LED US TO CONCLUDE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL, PROPRIETARY FORMULATION OF DRONABINOL WOULD ONLY  DELAY MARKET ENTRY BY APPROXIMATELY 12 MONTHS. THIRD, WE RECENTLY HAVE FILED A CONTINUATION IN PART FOR OUR PENDING PATENT CLAIMING  DOSAGE AND CONTROLLED RELEASE OF DRONABINOL AS WELL AS A NEW U.S. PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION FURTHER CLAIMING DOSAGE AND CONTROLLED  RELEASE OF CANNABINOIDS ALONE OR IN COMBINATION INCLUDING WITH NON-CANNABINOID MOLECULES. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE NEW FILINGS, IF  APPROVED, SHOULD PROVIDE MARKET PROTECTIONS THROUGH AT LEAST 2036. FINALLY, A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL CANNABINOID INVESTORS AND STRATEGIC  PARTNERS WITH WHOM WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST ONLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW, PROPRIETARY FORMULATION WITH  EXTENDED PATENT LIFE.  40  WE  HAVE IDENTIFIED, AND INITIATED DISCUSSIONS WITH, SEVERAL FORMULATION COMPANIES WITH EXISTING DRONABINOL FORMULATIONS,  EXPERTISE AND LICENSURE TO DEVELOP A PROPRIETARY FORMULATION OF DRONABINOL FOR RESPIRERX BASED ON RESPIRERX\u2019S PENDING  PATENTS FOR LOW-DOSE AND EXTENDED RELEASE DRONABINOL. HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED THAT FORMULATION AGREEMENTS WILL  BE CONSUMMATED ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US. THE FAILURE TO CONSUMMATE THESE AGREEMENTS WOULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT  THE COMPANY.  TECHNOLOGY  RIGHTS  UNIVERSITY  OF ILLINOIS LICENSE AGREEMENT  SEE  NOTE 8.

THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES THE USE OF ESTIMATES  AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. MANAGEMENT  PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS MADE. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE  AND ON VARIOUS FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES  AS A RESULT OF DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE NOTES TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AND INCLUDE.  -  STOCK-BASED  AWARDS  -  CONVERTIBLE  NOTES PAYABLE  -  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS  -  LICENSE  AGREEMENTS  -  PATENT  COSTS  42  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  THREE-MONTHS  ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018  REVENUES.

LOSS  ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT AND OTHER LIABILITIES IN EXCHANGE FOR EQUITY  . DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE  LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT WAS $0 AS COMPARED TO $116,407 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. DURING FEBRUARY OF  2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED IN AN EXCHANGE AGREEMENT WITH THE HOLDER OF TWO 10% CONVERTIBLE NOTES PURSUANT TO WHICH $43,552 OF PRINCIPAL  AND ACCRUED INTEREST WERE EXCHANGED FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE, $0.001 RESULTING IN A LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT  OF THIS DEBT OF $66,782. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, THE COMPANY EXTINGUISHED A LIABILITY WITH COMMON STOCK PURCHASE OPTIONS  RESULTING IN A LOSS OF $11,154 AND EXCHANGED FOUR 10% CONVERTIBLE NOTES FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.001,  RESULTING IN A LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF $38,470.

NET  LOSS AND NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS  . FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED  A NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF $1,487,389, AS COMPARED TO A NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF  $1,917,817 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \u2013 SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  THE  COMPANY\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED ON THE BASIS THAT IT IS A GOING CONCERN, WHICH  CONTEMPLATES THE REALIZATION OF ASSETS AND SATISFACTION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED  NET LOSSES OF $1,487,389 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND $2,591,790 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2018, AND NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS OF $313,692 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND $427,368 FOR THE FISCAL  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, HAD A STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 DEFICIENCY OF $7,039,381 AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE  TO INCUR NET LOSSES AND NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT FEW YEARS. AS A RESULT, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT  THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, AND THE COMPANY\u2019S INDEPENDENT  REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, IN ITS REPORT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2018, EXPRESSED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF $7,039,381, AS COMPARED TO A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF $5,736,369  AT DECEMBER 31, 2018, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN THE WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF $1,303,012 FOR THE NINE MONTHS SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  THE INCREASE IN THE WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF AN INCREASE  IN TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES OF $1,288,679, AND A DECREASE IN CURRENT ASSETS OF $17,447. THE INCREASE IN CURRENT LIABILITIES IS  COMPRISED OF AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES OF $432,579, AN INCREASE IN ACCRUED COMPENSATION OF $585,900,  AN INCREASE IN CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE OF $229,401, AN INCREASE IN OTHER SHORT TERM NOTES PAYABLE (PRIMARILY INSURANCE PREMIUM  FINANCING) OF $19,090 AND AN INCREASE IN OFFICER AND FORMER OFFICER NOTES PAYABLE OF $42,963, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE  IN THE NOTE TO SY CORPORATION INCLUSIVE OF ACCRUED INTEREST OF $22,254.  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD CASH OF $94, AS COMPARED TO $33,284 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018, REFLECTING DECREASE IN CASH OF  $33,190 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. SINCE SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAS RAISED ADDITIONAL WORKING  CAPITAL, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 9. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT SEPTEMBER 30,  2019.  THE  COMPANY IS CURRENTLY, AND HAS FOR SOME TIME, BEEN IN SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL DISTRESS. IT HAS EXTREMELY LIMITED CASH RESOURCES AND  CURRENT ASSETS AND HAS NO ONGOING SOURCE OF REVENUE. MANAGEMENT IS CONTINUING TO ADDRESS NUMEROUS ASPECTS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S  OPERATIONS AND OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DEBT OBLIGATIONS, FINANCING REQUIREMENTS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, LICENSING  AGREEMENTS, LEGAL AND PATENT MATTERS AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE, AND HAS TAKEN STEPS TO CONTINUE TO RAISE NEW DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL  TO FUND THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.  44  THE  COMPANY IS CONTINUING ITS EFFORTS TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PAY ITS LIABILITIES AND FUND ITS BUSINESS  ACTIVITIES ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS AND REGULARLY EVALUATES VARIOUS MEASURES TO SATISFY THE COMPANY\u2019S LIQUIDITY NEEDS, INCLUDING  DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER AGREEMENTS WITH COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS AND SEEKING TO EXCHANGE OR RESTRUCTURE SOME OF THE COMPANY\u2019S  OUTSTANDING SECURITIES. THE COMPANY IS EVALUATING CERTAIN CHANGES TO ITS OPERATIONS AND STRUCTURE TO FACILITATE RAISING CAPITAL  FROM SOURCES THAT MAY BE INTERESTED IN FINANCING ONLY DISCRETE ASPECTS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. SUCH CHANGES  COULD INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT REORGANIZATION. THOUGH THE COMPANY ACTIVELY PURSUES OPPORTUNITIES TO FINANCE ITS OPERATIONS THROUGH  EXTERNAL SOURCES OF DEBT AND EQUITY FINANCING, IT HAS EXPERIENCED VERY LIMITED ACCESS TO SUCH FINANCING, AND THE COST OF SUCH  CAPITAL, BOTH IN TERMS OF RATES AND OTHER CONDITIONS, HAS BEEN HIGH. ACCORDINGLY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT FURTHER  FINANCING WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY, OR AT ALL.  OPERATING  ACTIVITIES  . FOR THE NINE MONTHS MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OPERATING ACTIVITIES UTILIZED CASH OF $313,692, AS COMPARED  TO UTILIZING CASH OF $199,966 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY\u2019S ONGOING GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS WELL AS ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.  FINANCING  ACTIVITIES  . FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, FINANCING ACTIVITIES CONSISTED OF THE BORROWINGS ON CONVERTIBLE  NOTES WITH WARRANTS OF $353,500 AND THE FINANCING WITH A SHORT TERM NOTE OF $71,068 IN CONNECTION WITH THE NEW DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS\u2019  INSURANCE POLICY AS WELL AS OTHER INSURANCE POLICIES.

THE COMPANY'S ORGANIC SALES DISCLOSURES EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY THAT CAN OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF ORGANIC SALES IS MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS AS IT PROVIDES THEM WITH USEFUL INFORMATION TO AID IN IDENTIFYING UNDERLYING SALES TRENDS IN OUR BUSINESSES AND FACILITATING COMPARISONS OF OUR SALES PERFORMANCE WITH PRIOR PERIODS.  NET SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , DECREASED  2.1%  TO  $286.9 MILLION  , COMPARED TO  $293.2 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, GROSS MARGIN DECREASED TO  49.3%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , FROM  50.0%  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INPUT COSTS SUCH AS PERSONNEL, MATERIAL, TARIFF, AND FREIGHT COSTS, ALONG WITH REDUCED SALES VOLUME, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND DRIVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, INCLUDING INCREASED AUTOMATION IN OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.

OPERATING INCOME WAS  $40.9 MILLION  AND  $40.6 MILLION  FOR  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES HELD IN DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS AND AN INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  INTEREST EXPENSE REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT AT  $0.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , FROM  $0.7 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR AS THERE WAS MINIMAL CHANGE IN THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL BALANCE UNDER ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT AGREEMENTS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE COMPANY EVALUATES SHORT-TERM SEGMENT PERFORMANCE BASED ON SEGMENT PROFIT AND CUSTOMER SALES. INTEREST EXPENSE, INVESTMENT AND OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, INCOME TAXES, AND CERTAIN CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ARE EXCLUDED WHEN EVALUATING SEGMENT PERFORMANCE.  THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF SEGMENT INFORMATION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  .

ORGANIC SALES IN THE AMERICAS INCREASED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN THE SAFETY AND FACILITY ID AND PRODUCT ID PRODUCT LINES. ORGANIC SALES GREW IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS IN THE UNITED STATES AND DECLINED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS IN THE REST OF THE AMERICAS.  ORGANIC SALES IN EUROPE DECREASED IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN THE SAFETY AND FACILITY ID PRODUCT LINE. THE ORGANIC SALES DECLINE WAS DUE TO BUSINESSES IN EMERGING GEOGRAPHIES DUE TO A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT CERTAIN BUSINESSES BASED IN WESTERN EUROPE.  ORGANIC SALES IN ASIA DECREASED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN THE SAFETY AND FACILITY ID AND PRODUCT ID PRODUCT LINES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN THE WIRE ID PRODUCT LINE. ORGANIC SALES DECLINED IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGITS WITHIN CHINA PARTIALLY DUE TO THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACT OF TARIFFS, AND REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT IN THE REST OF ASIA.  SEGMENT PROFIT INCREASED  2.1%  TO  $42.4 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $41.6 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

ORGANIC SALES IN EUROPE INCREASED MODESTLY FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. ORGANIC SALES GROWTH IN FRANCE AND BELGIUM WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN SALES IN GERMANY DUE TO REDUCED DEMAND IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND EXPORTS. SALES THROUGHOUT THE REST OF EUROPE REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT. SALES THROUGH THE DIGITAL CHANNEL INCREASED IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGITS WHILE SALES THROUGH THE CATALOG CHANNEL DECREASED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS.  ORGANIC SALES IN THE AMERICAS DECLINED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A LOW-SINGLE DIGIT DECLINE IN CATALOG SALES AND A SLIGHT DECLINE IN SALES THROUGH THE DIGITAL CHANNEL. THIS BUSINESS CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON SALES FROM A DIGITAL PLATFORM THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN FISCAL 2018 AND TRANSITIONED TO A NEW DIGITAL PLATFORM IN FISCAL 2019 TO ADDRESS THIS DECLINE. THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE NEW DIGITAL PLATFORM HAS IMPROVED COMPARED TO THE FORMER DIGITAL PLATFORM; HOWEVER, SALES HAVE NOT YET RETURNED TO THE LEVEL EXPERIENCED PRIOR TO THE INITIAL PLATFORM CHANGE IN FISCAL 2018.  ORGANIC SALES IN AUSTRALIA DECLINED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS IN BOTH THE DIGITAL AND TRADITIONAL CATALOG CHANNEL FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

FINANCIAL CONDITION  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE  $295.1 MILLION  AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , AN INCREASE OF  $16.0 MILLION  FROM  JULY 31, 2019  . THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  NET CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY (USED IN).  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $38,848  $18,818  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (7,197  )  (5,672  )  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (15,326  )  664  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH  (304  )  (3,061  )  NET INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $16,021  $10,749  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $38.8 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $18.8 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PAYMENTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $7.2 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $5.7 MILLION  USED IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE PURCHASE OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT AND FACILITY UPGRADES IN EUROPE, MEXICO, AND THE UNITED STATES.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $15.3 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $0.7 MILLION  PROVIDED IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND AN INCREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS FOR EMPLOYEE TAXES WITHHELD FROM STOCK-BASED AWARDS IN THE CURRENT THREE-MONTH PERIOD.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE EFFECT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES DECREASED CASH BALANCES BY  $0.3 MILLION  PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH HELD IN CURRENCIES THAT DEPRECIATED AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR DURING  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019.  ON MAY 13, 2010, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF \u20ac75.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES TO ACCREDITED INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS. THE \u20ac75.0 MILLION OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTED OF \u20ac30.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.71% SERIES 2010-A SENIOR NOTES, WHICH WERE REPAID DURING FISCAL 2017, AND \u20ac45.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 4.24% SERIES 2010-A SENIOR NOTES, DUE MAY 13, 2020, WITH INTEREST PAYABLE ON THE NOTES SEMIANNUALLY. THIS PRIVATE PLACEMENT WAS EXEMPT FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933. THE NOTES HAVE BEEN FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED ON AN UNSECURED BASIS BY THE COMPANY\u2019S DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES.  ON AUGUST 1, 2019, THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO AN UNSECURED $200 MILLION MULTI-CURRENCY REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT WITH A GROUP OF FIVE BANKS THAT REPLACED AND TERMINATED THE COMPANY\u2019S PREVIOUS LOAN AGREEMENT THAT HAD BEEN ENTERED INTO ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2015. UNDER THE NEW REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS THE OPTION TO SELECT EITHER A BASE INTEREST RATE (BASED UPON THE HIGHER OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE PLUS ONE-HALF OF 1% OR THE PRIME RATE OF THE BANK OF MONTREAL PLUS A MARGIN BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED NET LEVERAGE RATIO), OR THE EUROCURRENCY INTEREST RATE (AT THE LIBOR RATE PLUS A MARGIN BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED NET LEVERAGE RATIO) PLUS 1%. AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, THE AVAILABLE AMOUNT UNDER THE REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT MAY BE INCREASED FROM $200 MILLION TO $400 MILLION. AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING ON THE CREDIT FACILITY,  AND THERE WAS NO OUTSTANDING BALANCES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  . THE COMPANY  HAD LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT OF $3.6 MILLION AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND THERE WAS $196.4 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE BORROWING, WHICH CAN BE INCREASED TO $396.4 MILLION AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  THE REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT HAS A FINAL MATURITY DATE OF AUGUST 1, 2024. AS SUCH, THE BORROWING IS INCLUDED IN \"LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS, LESS CURRENT MATURITIES\" ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S DEBT AGREEMENTS REQUIRE IT TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING A RATIO OF DEBT TO THE TRAILING 12 MONTHS EBITDA, AS DEFINED IN THE DEBT AGREEMENTS, OF NOT MORE THAN A 3.5 TO 1.0 RATIO (LEVERAGE RATIO) AND THE TRAILING 12 MONTHS EBITDA TO INTEREST EXPENSE OF NOT LESS THAN A 3.0 TO 1.0 RATIO (INTEREST EXPENSE COVERAGE). AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, WITH THE RATIO OF DEBT TO EBITDA, AS DEFINED BY THE AGREEMENTS, EQUAL TO 0.0 TO 1.0 AND THE INTEREST EXPENSE COVERAGE RATIO EQUAL TO 72.1 TO 1.0.  THE COMPANY'S CASH BALANCES ARE GENERATED AND HELD IN NUMEROUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY 44% OF THE COMPANY'S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE HELD OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY'S GROWTH HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN FUNDED BY A COMBINATION OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND DEBT FINANCING. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND ITS BORROWING CAPACITY ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND ITS ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, SCHEDULED DEBT REPAYMENTS, AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE MATERIAL OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS. THE COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF FACTORS THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO ADVERSELY AFFECT LIQUIDITY TRENDS, OTHER THAN THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED IN THIS AND OTHER COMPANY FILINGS.

YOU SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING PROVIDER OF ONLINE AUCTIONS AND VEHICLE REMARKETING SERVICES WITH OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cU.S.\u201d), CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM (\u201cU.K.\u201d), BRAZIL, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, GERMANY, FINLAND, THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (\u201cU.A.E.\u201d), OMAN, BAHRAIN, AND SPAIN.  OUR GOALS ARE TO GENERATE SUSTAINABLE PROFITS FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS, WHILE ALSO PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS FOR THE WORLD AROUND US. WITH RESPECT TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, WE BELIEVE OUR BUSINESS IS A CRITICAL ENABLER FOR THE GLOBAL RE-USE AND RECYCLING OF VEHICLES, PARTS AND RAW MATERIALS. MANY OF THE CARS WE PROCESS AND REMARKET ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RESTORED TO DRIVABLE CONDITION, REDUCING THE NEW VEHICLE MANUFACTURING BURDEN THE WORLD WOULD OTHERWISE FACE. MANY OF OUR CARS ARE PURCHASED BY DISMANTLERS, WHO RECYCLE AND REFURBISH PARTS FOR VEHICLE REPAIRS, AGAIN REDUCING NEW AND AFTERMARKET PARTS MANUFACTURING. AND FINALLY, SOME OF OUR VEHICLES ARE RETURNED TO THEIR RAW MATERIAL INPUTS THROUGH SCRAPPING, REDUCING THE NEED FOR FURTHER DE NOVO RESOURCE EXTRACTION. IN EACH CASE, OUR BUSINESS HAS REDUCED THE CARBON AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT OF THE GLOBAL TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY. BEYOND OUR ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, WE ALSO SUPPORT THE WORLD\u2019S COMMUNITIES IN TWO IMPORTANT WAYS. FIRST, WE BELIEVE THAT WE CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND WELL-BEING BY ENABLING MORE AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO MOBILITY AROUND THE WORLD. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY OF THE AUTOMOBILES SOLD THROUGH OUR AUCTION PLATFORM ARE PURCHASED FOR USE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHERE AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION IS A CRITICAL ENABLER OF EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, AND WELL-BEING MORE GENERALLY. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL ROLE WE PLAY IN RESPONDING TO CATASTROPHIC WEATHER EVENTS, WE BELIEVE WE CONTRIBUTE TO DISASTER RECOVERY AND RESILIENCE IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MOBILIZED OUR PEOPLE, ENTERED INTO EMERGENCY LEASES, AND ENGAGED WITH A MULTITUDE OF SERVICE PROVIDERS TO TIMELY RETRIEVE, STORE, AND REMARKET TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FLOOD-DAMAGED VEHICLES IN THE HOUSTON, TEXAS METROPOLITAN AREA IN THE WAKE OF HURRICANE HARVEY IN THE SUMMER OF 2017.  WE PROVIDE VEHICLE SELLERS WITH A FULL RANGE OF SERVICES TO PROCESS AND SELL VEHICLES PRIMARILY OVER THE INTERNET THROUGH OUR VIRTUAL BIDDING THIRD GENERATION INTERNET AUCTION-STYLE SALES TECHNOLOGY, WHICH WE REFER TO AS VB3. VEHICLE SELLERS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF INSURANCE COMPANIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDE BANKS, FINANCE COMPANIES, CHARITIES, FLEET OPERATORS, DEALERS AND VEHICLES SOURCED DIRECTLY FROM INDIVIDUAL OWNERS. WE SELL THE VEHICLES PRINCIPALLY TO LICENSED VEHICLE DISMANTLERS, REBUILDERS, REPAIR LICENSEES, USED VEHICLE DEALERS AND EXPORTERS AND, AT CERTAIN LOCATIONS, TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE MAJORITY OF THE VEHICLES SOLD ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE EITHER DAMAGED VEHICLES DEEMED A TOTAL LOSS; NOT ECONOMICALLY REPAIRABLE BY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES; OR ARE RECOVERED STOLEN VEHICLES FOR WHICH AN INSURANCE SETTLEMENT WITH THE VEHICLE OWNER HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE. WE OFFER VEHICLE SELLERS A FULL RANGE OF SERVICES THAT HELP EXPEDITE EACH STAGE OF THE VEHICLE SALES PROCESS, MINIMIZE ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROCESSING COSTS, AND MAXIMIZE THE ULTIMATE SALES PRICE THROUGH THE ONLINE AUCTION PROCESS.  IN THE U.S., CANADA, BRAZIL, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, FINLAND, THE U.A.E., OMAN, AND BAHRAIN, WE SELL VEHICLES PRIMARILY AS AN AGENT AND DERIVE REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM AUCTION AND AUCTION RELATED SALES TRANSACTION FEES CHARGED FOR VEHICLE REMARKETING SERVICES AS WELL AS FEES FOR SERVICES SUBSEQUENT TO THE AUCTION, SUCH AS DELIVERY AND STORAGE. IN THE U.K., GERMANY, AND SPAIN, WE OPERATE BOTH AS AN AGENT AND ON A PRINCIPAL BASIS, IN SOME CASES PURCHASING SALVAGE VEHICLES OUTRIGHT AND RESELLING THE VEHICLES FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT. IN GERMANY AND SPAIN, WE ALSO DERIVE REVENUE FROM LISTING VEHICLES ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE EXPERTS TO DETERMINE THE VEHICLE\u2019S RESIDUAL VALUE AND/OR TO FACILITATE A SALE FOR THE INSURED.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE MONITOR AND ANALYZE A NUMBER OF KEY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS AND EVALUATE OUR FINANCIAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE. SUCH INDICATORS INCLUDE.  SERVICE AND VEHICLE SALES REVENUE.  OUR SERVICE REVENUE CONSISTS OF AUCTION AND AUCTION RELATED SALES TRANSACTION FEES CHARGED FOR VEHICLE REMARKETING SERVICES. THESE AUCTION AND AUCTION RELATED SERVICES MAY INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF VEHICLE PURCHASING FEES, VEHICLE LISTING FEES, AND VEHICLE SELLING FEES THAT CAN BE BASED ON A PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF THE VEHICLE SALES PRICE, TIERED VEHICLE SALES PRICE DRIVEN FEES, OR AT A FIXED FEE BASED ON THE SALE OF EACH VEHICLE REGARDLESS OF THE SELLING PRICE OF THE VEHICLE; TRANSPORTATION FEES FOR THE COST OF TRANSPORTING THE VEHICLE TO OR FROM OUR FACILITY; TITLE PROCESSING AND PREPARATION FEES; VEHICLE STORAGE FEES; BIDDING FEES; AND VEHICLE LOADING FEES. THESE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED AS NET REVENUE (NOT GROSS VEHICLE SELLING PRICE) AT THE TIME OF AUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF SUCH FEES CHARGED. PURCHASED VEHICLE REVENUE INCLUDES THE GROSS SALES PRICE OF THE VEHICLES WHICH WE HAVE PURCHASED OR ARE OTHERWISE CONSIDERED TO OWN. WE HAVE CERTAIN CONTRACTS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, PRIMARILY IN THE U.K., IN WHICH WE ACT AS A PRINCIPAL, PURCHASING VEHICLES AND RESELLING THEM FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT. WE ALSO PURCHASE VEHICLES IN THE OPEN MARKET, PRIMARILY FROM INDIVIDUALS, AND RESELL THEM FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT.  OUR REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY AND THE AVERAGE VEHICLE AUCTION SELLING PRICE, AS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SERVICE REVENUE IS ASSOCIATED IN SOME MANNER WITH THE ULTIMATE SELLING PRICE OF THE VEHICLE. VEHICLE AUCTION SELLING PRICES ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY: (I) DOMESTIC AND MARKET DEMAND FOR REBUILDABLE, DRIVABLE VEHICLES; (II) USED CAR PRICING, WHICH WE ALSO BELIEVE HAS AN IMPACT ON TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY; (III) END MARKET DEMAND FOR RECYCLED AND REFURBISHED PARTS AS REFLECTED IN DEMAND FROM DISMANTLERS; (IV) THE MIX OF CARS SOLD; (V) CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE HAS AN IMPACT ON AUCTION PARTICIPATION BY INTERNATIONAL BUYERS; AND (VI) CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, PARTICULARLY THE PER TON PRICE FOR CRUSHED CAR BODIES, AS WE BELIEVE THIS HAS AN IMPACT ON THE ULTIMATE SELLING PRICE OF VEHICLES SOLD FOR SCRAP AND VEHICLES SOLD FOR DISMANTLING. WE CANNOT SPECIFICALLY QUANTIFY THE FINANCIAL IMPACT THAT COMMODITY PRICING, USED CAR PRICING, AND PRODUCT SALES MIX HAS ON THE SELLING PRICE OF VEHICLES, OUR SERVICE REVENUES OR FINANCIAL RESULTS. TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY IS THE PERCENTAGE OF CARS INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES SALVAGE RATHER THAN REPAIR AND IS DRIVEN BY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REPAIR COSTS, USED CAR VALUES, AND AUCTION RETURNS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN OVERALL GROWTH IN THE SALVAGE MARKET DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY MAY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY THE DECLINE IN USED CAR VALUES RELATIVE TO REPAIR COSTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE GENERALLY TRENDING UPWARD. CONVERSELY, INCREASES IN USED CAR PRICES, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING THE MOST RECENT RECESSION, MAY DECREASE TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROWTH RATE. USED CAR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING USED CAR SUPPLY, WHICH IS TIED DIRECTLY TO NEW CAR SALES, AND THE AVERAGE AGE OF CARS ON THE ROAD. THE AVERAGE AGE OF CARS ON THE ROAD CONTINUED TO INCREASE, GROWING FROM 9.6 YEARS IN 2002 TO 11.8 YEARS IN 2019. THE FACTORS THAT CAN INFLUENCE REPAIR COSTS, USED CAR PRICING, AND AUCTION RETURNS ARE MANY AND VARIED AND WE CANNOT PREDICT THEIR MOVEMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE TRENDS IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY.  OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES.  YARD OPERATIONS EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF OPERATING PERSONNEL (WHICH INCLUDES YARD MANAGEMENT, CLERICAL AND YARD EMPLOYEES), RENT, CONTRACT VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION, INSURANCE, FUEL, EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR, AND COSTS OF VEHICLES SOLD UNDER THE PURCHASE CONTRACTS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING, SALES PERSONNEL, HUMAN RESOURCES, PROFESSIONAL FEES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND MARKETING EXPENSES.  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.  OTHER INCOME PRIMARILY INCLUDES INCOME FROM THE RENTAL OF CERTAIN REAL PROPERTY, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE GAINS AND LOSSES, AND GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, WHICH WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THESE ACTIVITIES EACH PERIOD. OTHER EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON LONG-TERM DEBT. SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  3 \u2013 LONG-TERM DEBT.  LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF WORKING CAPITAL IS CASH OPERATING RESULTS AND DEBT FINANCING. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OUR LIQUIDITY IS OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY. THE PRIMARY FACTORS AFFECTING CASH OPERATING RESULTS ARE: (I) SEASONALITY; (II) MARKET WINS AND LOSSES; (III) SUPPLIER MIX; (IV) ACCIDENT FREQUENCY; (V) TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY; (VI) INCREASED VOLUME FROM OUR EXISTING SUPPLIERS; (VII) COMMODITY PRICING; (VIII) USED CAR PRICING; (IX) FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES; (X) PRODUCT MIX; (XI) CONTRACT MIX TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE; AND (XII) OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THESE FACTORS ARE FURTHER DISCUSSED IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND RISK FACTORS SECTIONS OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  POTENTIAL INTERNAL SOURCES OF ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL ARE THE SALE OF ASSETS OR THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES THROUGH OPTION EXERCISES AND SHARES ISSUED UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. A POTENTIAL EXTERNAL SOURCE OF ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL IS THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL DEBT WITH NEW LENDERS AND EQUITY. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT PREDICT IF THESE SOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE OR ON COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TERMS.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ACQUISITIONS AND NEW OPERATIONS  AS PART OF OUR OVERALL EXPANSION STRATEGY OF OFFERING INTEGRATED SERVICES TO VEHICLE SELLERS, WE ANTICIPATE ACQUIRING AND DEVELOPING FACILITIES IN NEW REGIONS, AS WELL AS THE REGIONS CURRENTLY SERVED BY OUR FACILITIES.

IN ADDITION TO GROWTH THROUGH BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, WE SEEK TO INCREASE REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) ACQUIRING AND DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL VEHICLE STORAGE FACILITIES IN KEY MARKETS; (II) PURSUING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL VEHICLE SELLER AGREEMENTS; (III) INCREASING OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS; AND (IV) EXPANDING THE APPLICATION OF VB3 INTO NEW MARKETS. IN ADDITION, WE IMPLEMENT OUR PRICING STRUCTURE AND AUCTION PROCEDURES, AND ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE COST EFFICIENCIES AT EACH OF OUR ACQUIRED FACILITIES BY IMPLEMENTING OUR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES, INTEGRATING OUR MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND REDEPLOYING PERSONNEL, WHEN NECESSARY.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS CERTAIN DATA FROM OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL SERVICE REVENUES AND VEHICLE SALES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  .

THE  INCREASE  IN SERVICE REVENUES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  OF  $93.1 MILLION  , OR  23.6%  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR RESULTED FROM (I)  AN INCREASE  IN THE U.S. OF  $87.2 MILLION  AND (II)  AN INCREASE  IN INTERNATIONAL OF  $5.8 MILLION  . THE GROWTH IN THE U.S. WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY (I) INCREASED VOLUME AND (II) AN INCREASE IN REVENUE PER CAR DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE AUCTION SELLING PRICES, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF VEHICLES SOLD. THE INCREASE IN VOLUME IN THE U.S. WAS DERIVED FROM (I) GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF UNITS SOLD FROM NEW AND EXPANDED CONTRACTS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, AND (II) GROWTH FROM EXISTING SUPPLIERS, DRIVEN BY WHAT WE BELIEVE WAS AN INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY. EXCLUDING THE DETRIMENTAL IMPACT OF $2.3 MILLION DUE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY FROM THE CHANGE IN THE BRITISH POUND AND BRAZILIAN REAL TO U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATES, THE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL OF $8.1 MILLION WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED VOLUME AND HIGHER AVERAGE AUCTION SELLING PRICES.

INCLUDED IN YARD OPERATIONS EXPENSES WERE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES. THE  DECREASE  IN YARD OPERATIONS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOMING FULLY AMORTIZED.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO PAYMENTS FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED TAX WITHHOLDINGS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES NOT FULLY OFFSET BY CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED PRIMARILY FROM CERTAIN INCOME TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES AND TIMING OF CASH PAYMENTS. CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSISTED OF BANK DEPOSITS, DOMESTIC CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, AND FUNDS INVESTED IN MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS, WHICH BEAR INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES.  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR GROWTH THROUGH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF COMMON STOCK, EQUITY ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT FINANCING. OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS IS FROM THE COLLECTION OF SERVICE FEES AND REIMBURSABLE ADVANCES FROM THE PROCEEDS OF VEHICLE SALES. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO FINANCE OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND TO DEVELOP AND GROW OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION TO OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE ARE CONSIDERING A VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL USES FOR OUR REMAINING CASH BALANCES AND OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. THESE ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL USES INCLUDE ADDITIONAL STOCK REPURCHASES, REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT, THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AND ACQUISITIONS. FOR FURTHER DETAIL, SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  3 \u2013 LONG-TERM DEBT  AND  NOTE  9 \u2013 STOCK REPURCHASES  AND UNDER THE SUBHEADINGS \u201c  CREDIT AGREEMENT  \u201d AND \u201c  NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT  \u201d BELOW.  OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL AS INCLEMENT WEATHER DURING THE WINTER MONTHS INCREASES THE FREQUENCY OF ACCIDENTS AND CONSEQUENTLY, THE NUMBER OF CARS INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS WHICH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SALVAGE RATHER THAN REPAIR. DURING THE WINTER MONTHS, MOST OF OUR FACILITIES PROCESS 10% TO 30% MORE VEHICLES THAN AT OTHER TIMES OF THE YEAR. THIS INCREASED VOLUME REQUIRES THE INCREASED USE OF OUR CASH TO PAY OUT ADVANCES AND HANDLING COSTS OF THE ADDITIONAL BUSINESS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENTLY AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR OPERATING AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE EXPECT TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS AND EXPAND SOME OF OUR CURRENT FACILITIES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CASH THROUGH DRAWDOWNS ON OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY OR ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY TO FUND THIS EXPANSION. ALTHOUGH THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF GROWTH THROUGH EXPANSION AND ACQUISITIONS ARE NOT PREDICTABLE, THE OPENING OF NEW GREENFIELD YARDS IS CONTINGENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE PROPERTY THAT (I) IS IN AN AREA IN WHICH WE HAVE A NEED FOR MORE CAPACITY; (II) HAS ADEQUATE SIZE GIVEN THE CAPACITY NEEDS; (III) HAS THE APPROPRIATE SHAPE AND TOPOGRAPHY FOR OUR OPERATIONS; (IV) IS REASONABLY CLOSE TO A MAJOR ROAD OR HIGHWAY; AND (V) MOST IMPORTANTLY, HAS THE APPROPRIATE ZONING FOR OUR BUSINESS. COSTS TO DEVELOP A NEW YARD CAN RANGE FROM $3.0 TO $50.0 MILLION, DEPENDING ON SIZE, LOCATION AND DEVELOPMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS.  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  ,  $93.3 MILLION  OF THE  $181.1 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IF THESE FUNDS ARE NEEDED FOR OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., THE REPATRIATION OF THESE FUNDS COULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX FOLLOWING THE U.S. TAX REFORM. HOWEVER, OUR INTENT IS TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST THESE FUNDS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND OUR CURRENT PLANS DO NOT REQUIRE REPATRIATION TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONS.  NET CASH  PROVIDED BY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE TO IMPROVED CASH OPERATING RESULTS FROM AN INCREASE IN SERVICE REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN YARD OPERATIONS AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A AN INCREASE OF INCOME TAXES RECEIVABLE OF $44.0 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN FUNDS USED TO PAY ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $37.2 MILLION.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET CASH  USED IN  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO LEASE BUYOUTS OF CERTAIN FACILITIES, ACQUIRING LAND, OPENING AND IMPROVING FACILITIES, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR NEW SOFTWARE FOR INTERNAL USE AND MAJOR SOFTWARE ENHANCEMENTS, AND ACQUIRING YARD EQUIPMENT. WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP, EXPAND AND INVEST IN NEW AND EXISTING FACILITIES AND STANDARDIZE THE APPEARANCE OF EXISTING LOCATIONS.  NET CASH  USED IN  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO PAYMENTS FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK BASED TAX WITHHOLDINGS, AS DISCUSSED IN FURTHER DETAIL UNDER THE SUBHEADING \"  STOCK REPURCHASES  \" PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS.

THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT EXTENDED THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR THE TERM LOAN AND DECREASED THE QUARTERLY AMORTIZATION PAYMENTS FOR THAT LOAN TO  $7.5 MILLION  PER QUARTER. THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT ADDITIONALLY REDUCED THE PRICING LEVELS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT TO A RANGE OF  0.15%  TO  0.30%  IN THE CASE OF THE COMMITMENT FEE,  1.125%  TO  2.0%  IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR LIBOR LOANS, AND  0.125%  TO  1.0%  IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR BASE RATE LOANS, BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO DURING THE PRECEDING FISCAL QUARTER. WE BORROWED THE ENTIRE  $93.8 MILLION  PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE INCREMENTAL TERM LOAN CONCURRENT WITH THE CLOSING OF THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT.  ON  JULY 21, 2016  , WE ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cSECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, SUNTRUST BANK, AND BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT (AS SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST TO WELLS FARGO BANK).

THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSES OF THESE FINANCING TRANSACTIONS WERE TO INCREASE THE SIZE AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FINANCING. THE PROCEEDS ARE BEING USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, POTENTIAL SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS, OR OTHER INVESTMENTS RELATING TO OUR EXPANSION STRATEGIES IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

THE INTEREST RATE AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  ON OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY WAS THE ONE MONTH  LIBOR RATE OF 1.78% PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN OF 1.00%.  THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS COMPRISED OF BORROWINGS UNDER WHICH INTEREST ACCRUES UNDER A FLUCTUATING INTEREST RATE STRUCTURE. ACCORDINGLY, THE CARRYING VALUE APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , AND WAS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL II OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AMOUNTS BORROWED UNDER THE REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY  MAY BE REPAID AND REBORROWED UNTIL THE MATURITY DATE OF  JULY 21, 2021  . WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY A COMMITMENT FEE ON THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY. THE COMMITMENT FEE RATE RANGES FROM  0.125%  TO  0.20%  , DEPENDING ON OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO DURING THE PRECEDING FISCAL QUARTER, ON THE AVERAGE DAILY UNUSED PORTION OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. WE HAD  NO  OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  JULY 31, 2019.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.

NET SALES FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  3.5%  TO  $27.2 BILLION  FROM  $26.3 BILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE IN NET SALES IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET AND COMPARABLE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS. ONLINE SALES, WHICH CONSIST OF SALES GENERATED ONLINE THROUGH OUR WEBSITES FOR PRODUCTS PICKED UP IN OUR STORES OR DELIVERED TO CUSTOMER LOCATIONS, REPRESENTED  8.9%  OF NET SALES AND GREW  21.9%  DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SALES GROWTH BY  $41 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  COMPARABLE SALES  . COMPARABLE SALES IS A MEASURE THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR EXISTING LOCATIONS AND WEBSITES BY MEASURING THE CHANGE IN NET SALES FOR A PERIOD OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-PERIOD OF EQUIVALENT LENGTH. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDES SALES AT ALL LOCATIONS, PHYSICAL AND ONLINE, OPEN GREATER THAN 52 WEEKS (INCLUDING REMODELS AND RELOCATIONS) AND EXCLUDING CLOSED STORES. RETAIL STORES BECOME COMPARABLE ON THE MONDAY FOLLOWING THEIR 365  TH  DAY OF OPERATION. ACQUISITIONS, DIGITAL OR OTHERWISE, ARE INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE SALES AFTER WE OWN THE ACQUIRED ASSETS FOR MORE THAN 52 WEEKS. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDES NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERING SALES THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED FOR MORE THAN 52 WEEKS. COMPARABLE SALES EXCLUDES PRIOR-YEAR SALES OF PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS THAT WE HAVE EXITED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. FISCAL 2019 INCLUDES 52 WEEKS AND FISCAL 2018 INCLUDED 53  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WEEKS. FOR OUR CALCULATION OF COMPARABLE SALES IN FISCAL 2019, WE WILL COMPARE WEEKS 1 THROUGH 52 IN FISCAL 2019 AGAINST WEEKS 2 THROUGH 53 IN FISCAL 2018. COMPARABLE SALES IS INTENDED ONLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET SALES PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES  INCREASED  3.6%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , CONSISTING OF A  1.8%  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET AND A  1.8%  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS. THE  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE SALES REFLECTED A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TRAFFIC GROWTH ACROSS A NUMBER OF OUR CORE CATEGORIES AND THE EXECUTION OF OUR STRATEGIC EFFORTS TO DRIVE AN ENHANCED INTERCONNECTED EXPERIENCE IN BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL WORLDS.  ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS POSTED POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  EXCEPT FOR  ELECTRICAL/LIGHTING AND LUMBER  . COMPARABLE SALES FOR OUR  APPLIANCES, INDOOR GARDEN, DE\u0301COR/STORAGE, HARDWARE, TOOLS, OUTDOOR GARDEN, PAINT, AND PLUMBING  MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS WERE ABOVE THE COMPANY AVERAGE IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . COMPARABLE SALES FOR ELECTRICAL/LIGHTING WERE SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE DUE TO THE LENGTHENING REPLACEMENT CYCLE OF LIGHT BULBS AND COPPER PRICE DEFLATION. COMPARABLE SALES FOR LUMBER WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY COMMODITY PRICE DEFLATION.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COMPARABLE SALES GROWTH AND TOTAL SALES GROWTH IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS DUE TO THE SHIFT IN OUR FISCAL CALENDAR AS A RESULT OF THE 53  RD  WEEK IN FISCAL 2018.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  INCREASED  2.6%  TO  $9.4 BILLION  FROM  $9.2 BILLION  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, OR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN, WAS  34.5%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  34.8%  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . THE  DECREASE  IN GROSS PROFIT MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SHRINK AND A CHANGE IN PRODUCT MIX.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE COMPOSED OF SG&A AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE  . SG&A FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  2.8%  TO  $4.9 BILLION  FROM  $4.8 BILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, SG&A WAS  18.2%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO  18.3%  FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, DRIVEN BY EXPENSE LEVERAGE RESULTING FROM POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES AND CONTINUED EXPENSE CONTROL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXPENSES RELATED TO STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  INCREASED  $25 MILLION  TO  $498 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  FROM  $473 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  .

THE  INCREASE  IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NONRECURRING TAX BENEFITS RELATING TO THE TAX ACT AND THE SETTLEMENT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE  $2.53  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  $2.51  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FISCAL  2019  AND FISCAL  2018  NINE  MONTH COMPARISONS  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 3,  2019  OCTOBER 28,  2018  DOLLARS IN MILLIONS  $% OF  NET SALES  $% OF  NET SALES  NET SALES  $84,443  $81,712  GROSS PROFIT  28,836  34.1%  28,133  34.4%  OPERATING EXPENSES.

OUR COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET INCREASED  1.9%  FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , DUE IN PART TO BIG TICKET PURCHASES.  DURING THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS EXCEPT FOR LUMBER AND ELECTRICAL/LIGHTING POSTED POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES. COMPARABLE SALES FOR OUR  APPLIANCES, INDOOR GARDEN, DE\u0301COR/STORAGE, TOOLS, HARDWARE,  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUTDOOR GARDEN, PLUMBING, BUILDING MATERIALS, AND PAINT  MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS WERE ABOVE THE COMPANY AVERAGE FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  . COMPARABLE SALES FOR ELECTRICAL/LIGHTING WERE SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE DUE TO THE LENGTHENING REPLACEMENT CYCLE AND PRICE DEFLATION IN LIGHT BULBS.

THE  DECREASE  IN SG&A AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY EXPENSE LEVERAGE RESULTING FROM POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES AND CONTINUED EXPENSE CONTROL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXPENSES RELATED TO STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  . DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  INCREASED  $80 MILLION  TO  $1.5 BILLION  IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  FROM  $1.4 BILLION  IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  .

OUR COMBINED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS  24.5%  FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  23.3%  FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NONRECURRING TAX BENEFITS RELATING TO THE TAX ACT AND THE SETTLEMENT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE  $7.96  FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , COMPARED TO  $7.63  FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  TO PROVIDE CLARITY, INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY, ABOUT OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WE SUPPLEMENT OUR REPORTING WITH CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. HOWEVER, THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED GAAP MEASURES. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED HEREIN MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILAR MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL.  WE BELIEVE ROIC IS MEANINGFUL FOR INVESTORS AND MANAGEMENT BECAUSE IT MEASURES HOW EFFECTIVELY WE DEPLOY OUR CAPITAL BASE. WE DEFINE ROIC AS NOPAT, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, FOR THE MOST RECENT TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD, DIVIDED BY AVERAGE DEBT AND EQUITY. WE DEFINE AVERAGE DEBT AND EQUITY AS THE AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND ENDING LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING CURRENT INSTALLMENTS) AND EQUITY FOR THE MOST RECENT TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE CALCULATION OF ROIC, TOGETHER WITH A RECONCILIATION OF NOPAT TO NET EARNINGS (THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE), FOLLOWS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  AT  NOVEMBER 3, 2019  , WE HAD  $2.2 BILLION  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, OF WHICH  $1.8 BILLION  WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH POSITION, ACCESS TO THE LONG-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, AND FUNDS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT NOT ONLY FOR OUR OPERATING REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO TO ENABLE US TO COMPLETE OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS AND FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SHARE REPURCHASES, AND ANY REQUIRED LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL FISCAL YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING.  AS WE CONTINUE OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS, WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY  $2.7 BILLION  IN FISCAL  2019.  DEBT AND DERIVATIVES  WE HAVE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION. ALL OF OUR SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  WERE UNDER THESE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS, AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME WAS  $2.1 BILLION  . IN CONNECTION WITH THESE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITIES WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO $3.0 BILLION, WHICH CONSIST OF A FIVE-YEAR $2.0 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN DECEMBER 2022 AND A 364-DAY $1.0 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN DECEMBER 2019. AT  NOVEMBER 3, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITIES, AND NONE ARE EXPECTED TO IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES. AT  NOVEMBER 3, 2019  ,  $695 MILLION  WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS. WE ALSO ISSUE SENIOR NOTES FROM TIME TO TIME AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY.  WE USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES ON CERTAIN LONG-TERM DEBT. SEE  NOTE 4  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR SENIOR NOTES ISSUANCES AND OUR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  SHARE REPURCHASES  IN FEBRUARY 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW $15.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT REPLACED THE PREVIOUS AUTHORIZATION. IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , WE HAD CASH PAYMENTS OF  $3.9 BILLION  FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK THROUGH ASR AGREEMENTS AND OPEN MARKET PURCHASES.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOWS SUMMARY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS PROVIDES US WITH A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS RESULT PRIMARILY FROM CASH RECEIVED FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, OFFSET BY CASH PAYMENTS WE MAKE FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, OPERATIONS, AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  CASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL. WORKING CAPITAL AT ANY POINT IN TIME IS SUBJECT TO MANY VARIABLES, INCLUDING SEASONALITY, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND CATEGORY EXPANSION, THE TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS, VENDOR PAYMENT TERMS, AND FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $628 MILLION  IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  AND WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FROM THE CONTINUATION OF OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN OUR BUSINESS OF  $1.9 BILLION  DURING THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  $1.7 BILLION  OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

COMPARABLE SALES IS A MEASURE THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR STORES AND DIGITAL CHANNELS BY MEASURING THE CHANGE IN SALES FOR A PERIOD OVER THE COMPARABLE, PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD OF EQUIVALENT LENGTH. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDE ALL SALES, EXCEPT SALES FROM STORES OPEN LESS THAN 13 MONTHS, DIGITAL ACQUISITIONS WE HAVE OWNED LESS THAN 13 MONTHS, STORES THAT HAVE BEEN CLOSED, AND DIGITAL ACQUISITIONS THAT WE NO LONGER OPERATE.

GUESTS RECEIVE A 5 PERCENT DISCOUNT ON VIRTUALLY ALL PURCHASES WHEN THEY USE A REDCARD AT TARGET.  REDCARD PENETRATION  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2,  2019  NOVEMBER 3,  2018  NOVEMBER 2,  2019  NOVEMBER 3,  2018  TARGET DEBIT CARD  12.5%  12.9%  12.7%  13.1%  TARGET CREDIT CARDS  10.7  10.8  10.6  10.8  TOTAL REDCARD PENETRATION  23.1%  23.7%  23.3%  23.9%  NOTE: AMOUNTS MAY NOT FOOT DUE TO ROUNDING.  13  GROSS MARGIN RATE  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , OUR GROSS MARGIN RATE WAS  29.8 PERCENT  COMPARED WITH  28.7 PERCENT  IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO MERCHANDISING EFFORTS TO OPTIMIZE COSTS, PRICING, PROMOTIONS, AND ASSORTMENT, COMBINED WITH FAVORABLE CATEGORY SALES MIX. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, AGGREGATE SUPPLY CHAIN AND DIGITAL FULFILLMENT  COSTS HAD AN INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN RATE RELATIVE TO THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , OUR GROSS MARGIN RATE WAS  30.0 PERCENT  COMPARED WITH  29.6 PERCENT  IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO MERCHANDISING EFFORTS TO OPTIMIZE COSTS, PRICING, PROMOTIONS, AND ASSORTMENT, AND FAVORABLE CATEGORY SALES MIX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SUPPLY CHAIN AND DIGITAL FULFILLMENT COSTS.  14  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE RATE  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , OUR SG&A EXPENSE RATE WAS  22.3 PERCENT  COMPARED WITH  22.1 PERCENT  IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER COMPENSATION COSTS, INCLUDING STORE WAGES, AND MARKETING EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BROAD-BASED COST SAVINGS.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , OUR SG&A EXPENSE RATE WAS  21.4 PERCENT  COMPARED WITH  21.7 PERCENT  IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE REFLECTS LOWER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2019 AND BROAD-BASED COST SAVINGS.

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , INCLUDED $39 MILLION OF DISCRETE BENEFITS OF THE TAX ACT AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, RATE BENEFITS FROM OUR GLOBAL SOURCING OPERATIONS.  16  RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP MEASURES  TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY, WE HAVE DISCLOSED NON-GAAP ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS (ADJUSTED EPS). THIS METRIC EXCLUDES CERTAIN ITEMS PRESENTED BELOW. WE BELIEVE THIS INFORMATION IS USEFUL IN PROVIDING PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF THE RESULTS OF OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS. THIS MEASURE IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH, OR AN ALTERNATIVE TO, GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE U.S. (GAAP). THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE IS DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. ADJUSTED EPS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTION FOR ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP. OTHER COMPANIES MAY CALCULATE ADJUSTED EPS DIFFERENTLY, LIMITING THE USEFULNESS OF THE MEASURE FOR COMPARISONS WITH OTHER COMPANIES.

THESE MEASURES ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH, OR AN ALTERNATIVE TO, GAAP. THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE IS NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. EBIT AND EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTION FOR ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP. OTHER COMPANIES MAY CALCULATE EBIT AND EBITDA DIFFERENTLY, LIMITING THE USEFULNESS OF THE MEASURE FOR COMPARISONS WITH OTHER COMPANIES.

FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , AND  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , INCLUDES TAX EFFECT OF  $1,024 MILLION  AND  $514 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO EBIT, AND  $19 MILLION  AND  $10 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO OPERATING LEASE INTEREST.  (D)  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , AND  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , INCLUDES DISCRETE TAX ITEMS OF $(3) MILLION AND $382 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THE TAX ACT.

OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE INCLUDES SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF  $163 MILLION  ,  $769 MILLION  , AND  $42 MILLION  AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  ,  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , AND  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR INVESTMENT POLICY IS DESIGNED TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL AND LIQUIDITY OF OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. THIS POLICY ALLOWS INVESTMENTS IN LARGE MONEY MARKET FUNDS OR IN HIGHLY RATED DIRECT SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS THAT MATURE IN 60 DAYS OR LESS. WE ALSO PLACE DOLLAR LIMITS ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL FUNDS OR INSTRUMENTS.  CAPITAL ALLOCATION  WE FOLLOW A DISCIPLINED AND BALANCED APPROACH TO CAPITAL ALLOCATION BASED ON THE FOLLOWING PRIORITIES, RANKED IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE: FIRST, WE FULLY INVEST IN OPPORTUNITIES TO PROFITABLY GROW OUR BUSINESS, CREATE SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM VALUE, AND MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS AND ASSETS; SECOND, WE MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AND SEEK TO GROW IT ANNUALLY; AND FINALLY, WE RETURN ANY EXCESS CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS BY REPURCHASING SHARES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF OUR CREDIT RATING GOALS.  WE EXPECT 2019 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $3.1 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $3.5 BILLION IN 2018.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS  OPERATING CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY CONTINUING OPERATIONS WAS  $4,141 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  $3,614 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  . THE OPERATING CASH FLOW INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET EARNINGS DURING THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  INVENTORY  INVENTORY WAS  $11,396 MILLION  AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  $9,497 MILLION  AND  $12,393 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , AND  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE FROM  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , REFLECTS THE SEASONAL INVENTORY BUILD AHEAD OF THE NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER HOLIDAY SALES PERIOD. INVENTORY LEVELS WERE LOWER AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, COMPARED WITH NOVEMBER 3, 2018, PARTIALLY DUE TO TIMING OF RECEIPTS BECAUSE THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY IS LATER IN THE CURRENT YEAR. IN ADDITION, ELEVATED INVENTORY LEVELS IN THE PRIOR YEAR REFLECTED INVESTMENTS IN TOYS AND BABY-RELATED MERCHANDISE.  DIVIDENDS  WE PAID DIVIDENDS TOTALING  $337 MILLION  (  $0.66  PER SHARE) AND  $995 MILLION  (  $1.94  PER SHARE) FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  $337 MILLION  (  $0.64  PER SHARE) AND  $1,001 MILLION  (  $1.88  PER SHARE) FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, A PER SHARE INCREASE OF  3.1  PERCENT AND 3.2 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY. WE DECLARED DIVIDENDS TOTALING  $338 MILLION  (  $0.66  PER SHARE) DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  , A PER SHARE INCREASE OF  3.1  PERCENT OVER THE  $338 MILLION  (  $0.64  PER SHARE) OF DECLARED DIVIDENDS DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2018  . WE HAVE PAID DIVIDENDS EVERY QUARTER SINCE OUR 1967 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING, AND IT IS OUR INTENT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE.  SHARE REPURCHASE  WE RETURNED  $294 MILLION  AND $912 MILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASE DURING THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. SEE PART II, ITEM 2 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION.  20  FINANCING  OUR FINANCING STRATEGY IS TO ENSURE LIQUIDITY AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, TO MAINTAIN A BALANCED SPECTRUM OF DEBT MATURITIES, AND TO MANAGE OUR NET EXPOSURE TO FLOATING INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY. WITHIN THESE PARAMETERS, WE SEEK TO MINIMIZE OUR BORROWING COSTS. OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE LONG-TERM DEBT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS HAS PROVIDED US WITH AMPLE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. OUR CONTINUED ACCESS TO THESE MARKETS DEPENDS ON MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING THE CONDITION OF DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND MAINTAINING STRONG CREDIT RATINGS. AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , OUR CREDIT RATINGS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  CREDIT RATINGS  MOODY\u2019S  STANDARD AND POOR\u2019S  FITCH  LONG-TERM DEBT  A2  A  A-  COMMERCIAL PAPER  P-1  A-1  F1  IF OUR CREDIT RATINGS WERE LOWERED, OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT MARKETS, OUR COST OF FUNDS, AND OTHER TERMS FOR NEW DEBT ISSUANCES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. EACH OF THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES REVIEWS ITS RATING PERIODICALLY AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS WILL REMAIN THE SAME AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. FITCH RAISED OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER RATING FROM F2 TO F1 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019.  IN MARCH 2019, WE ISSUED  $1.0 BILLION  OF DEBT, AND IN JUNE 2019, WE REPAID  $1.0 BILLION  OF DEBT AT MATURITY. NOTES 5 AND 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  WE HAVE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY THROUGH A COMMITTED $2.5 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OBTAINED THROUGH A GROUP OF BANKS. IN OCTOBER 2018, WE EXTENDED THIS CREDIT FACILITY BY ONE YEAR TO OCTOBER 2023. NO BALANCES WERE OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME DURING  2019  OR  2018.  MOST OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS CONTAIN COVENANTS RELATED TO SECURED DEBT LEVELS. IN ADDITION TO A SECURED DEBT LEVEL COVENANT, OUR CREDIT FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS A DEBT LEVERAGE COVENANT. WE ARE, AND EXPECT TO REMAIN, IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , NO NOTES OR DEBENTURES CONTAINED PROVISIONS REQUIRING ACCELERATION OF PAYMENT UPON A CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE, EXCEPT THAT CERTAIN OUTSTANDING NOTES ALLOW THE NOTE HOLDERS TO PUT THE NOTES TO US IF WITHIN A MATTER OF MONTHS OF EACH OTHER WE EXPERIENCE BOTH (I) A CHANGE IN CONTROL; AND (II) OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ARE EITHER REDUCED AND THE RESULTING RATING IS NONINVESTMENT GRADE, OR OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ARE PLACED ON WATCH FOR POSSIBLE REDUCTION AND THOSE RATINGS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REDUCED AND THE RESULTING RATING IS NONINVESTMENT GRADE.  WE BELIEVE OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE ADEQUATE TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS, FINANCE ANTICIPATED EXPANSION AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, FUND DEBT MATURITIES, PAY DIVIDENDS, AND EXECUTE PURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE CONTINUE TO ANTICIPATE AMPLE ACCESS TO COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM FINANCING.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, OTHER THAN THE NEW BORROWINGS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS SINCE  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , AS REPORTED IN OUR  2018  FORM 10-K.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  21  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  THIS REPORT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY ACCOMPANIED BY THE WORDS \u201cEXPECT,\u201d \u201cMAY,\u201d \u201cCOULD,\u201d \u201cBELIEVE,\u201d \u201cWOULD,\u201d \u201cMIGHT,\u201d \u201cANTICIPATES,\u201d OR SIMILAR WORDS. THE PRINCIPAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT INCLUDE: OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, STATEMENTS REGARDING THE ADEQUACY OF AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, THE FUNDING OF DEBT MATURITIES, THE CONTINUED EXECUTION OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, OUR EXPECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND NEW LEASE COMMITMENTS, THE EXPECTED COMPLIANCE WITH DEBT COVENANTS, THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, OUR INTENTIONS REGARDING FUTURE DIVIDENDS, THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF, AND ADEQUACY OF OUR RESERVES FOR, CLAIMS, LITIGATION AND THE RESOLUTION OF TAX MATTERS, THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS.  ALL SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE INTENDED TO ENJOY THE PROTECTION OF THE SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995, AS AMENDED. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THERE IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT. THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SET FORTH ON OUR DESCRIPTION OF RISK FACTORS IN ITEM 1A OF OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , WHICH SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE MADE, AND WE DO NOT UNDERTAKE ANY OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "TARGET CORP", "CIK": 27419, "Date": "2019-11-27T00:00:00", "Ticker": "TGT", "Name": "Target Corp", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 5331.0, "Business": "MN", "Incorporated": "MN", "IRS": 410215170.0, "key": "20191127TGT", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": -0.7069102462271649, "labelr3": -0.8239340852731791, "labelr4": 0.04839490240361532, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5982916, "prof1": 0.40170845, "return1&2": 1.0070691024622715, "return1&2&3": 1.0153666880597128, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0148753023419874, "return2": 1.0070691024622715, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 1.0082393408527317, "return4": 0.999516050975964, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.00044917694496745116, "cumulative_return1&2": 9.298698974230048e-05, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 3.731442693196709e-07, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1.0350105167916033e-07, "indexx": 3599, "cumreturn1b": 0.30183161194479324, "cumreturndow": 1.0282760085846303, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0298617725317403}]}}, {"mode": "vega-lite"});

NET REVENUES WERE $8.32 BILLION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, 6% LOWER THAN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER NET REVENUES IN INVESTING & LENDING, DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN EQUITY SECURITIES, AND INVESTMENT BANKING, PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER NET REVENUES IN FINANCIAL ADVISORY. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUES IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES, ACROSS BOTH FIXED INCOME, CURRENCY AND COMMODITIES (FICC) CLIENT EXECUTION AND EQUITIES.  PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $291 MILLION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, 67% HIGHER THAN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER IMPAIRMENTS.

AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019 VERSUS SEPTEMBER 2018.  WE GENERATED NET EARNINGS OF $6.55 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, A DECREASE OF 17%, COMPARED WITH $7.92 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018. DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WAS $16.32 FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, A DECREASE OF 15%, COMPARED WITH $19.21 FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018. ANNUALIZED ROE WAS 10.4% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, COMPARED WITH 13.7% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018. BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019 WAS 5.5% HIGHER COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 2018.  NET REVENUES WERE $26.59 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, 7% LOWER THAN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018, REFLECTING LOWER NET REVENUES ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS. NET REVENUES WERE LOWER IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES, ACROSS BOTH EQUITIES AND FICC CLIENT EXECUTION, AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER INCENTIVE FEES.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS $729 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, 61% HIGHER THAN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER IMPAIRMENTS AND HIGHER PROVISIONS RELATED TO CONSUMER LOANS.  OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $17.60 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, 4% LOWER THAN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018, DUE TO LOWER COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES AND LOWER NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EXPENSES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS, TECHNOLOGY AND OUR CREDIT CARD ACTIVITIES.  PRE-TAX  EARNINGS WERE $8.26 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 AND INCLUDED OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR DIGITAL PLATFORM,  MARCUS: BY GOLDMAN SACHS  (MARCUS), OUR CREDIT CARD ACTIVITIES, AND THE PLANNED LAUNCH OF OUR TRANSACTION BANKING ACTIVITIES, WHICH COLLECTIVELY HAD A  PRE-TAX  LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION.  WE RETURNED $4.26 BILLION OF CAPITAL TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, INCLUDING $3.17 BILLION OF COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES AND $1.09 BILLION OF COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS.  BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, GLOBAL REAL GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) GROWTH APPEARED TO DECREASE COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, REFLECTING DECREASED GROWTH IN BOTH EMERGING MARKETS AND ADVANCED ECONOMIES, INCLUDING IN THE U.S. CONTINUED CONCERNS ABOUT FUTURE GLOBAL GROWTH AND A MIXED MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT LED TO ACCOMMODATIVE MONETARY POLICIES BY GLOBAL CENTRAL BANKS, INCLUDING TWO CUTS TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE BY THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE DURING THE QUARTER TO A TARGET RANGE OF 1.75% TO 2.00%. THE MARKET SENTIMENT IN THE THIRD QUARTER WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY CONTINUED GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY, INCLUDING ONGOING TRADE CONCERNS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA, THE APPROACHING DEADLINE RELATED TO THE U.K.\u2019S DECISION TO LEAVE THE E.U. (BREXIT), TURMOIL IN ARGENTINA AND A TEMPORARY SPIKE IN OIL PRICES. SEE \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2014 SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS DURING THE QUARTER.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  FAIR VALUE  FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED (I.E., INVENTORY), AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT FAIR VALUE (I.E.,  MARKED-TO-MARKET),  WITH RELATED GAINS OR LOSSES GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. THE USE OF FAIR VALUE TO MEASURE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND IS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY.  THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. WE MEASURE CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AS A PORTFOLIO (I.E., BASED ON ITS NET EXPOSURE TO MARKET AND/OR CREDIT RISKS). IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE, THE HIERARCHY UNDER U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (U.S. GAAP) GIVES (I) THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL, UNRESTRICTED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES (LEVEL 1 INPUTS), (II) THE NEXT PRIORITY TO INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY (LEVEL 2 INPUTS), AND (III) THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO INPUTS THAT CANNOT BE OBSERVED IN MARKET ACTIVITY (LEVEL 3 INPUTS). IN EVALUATING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A VALUATION INPUT, WE CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, A PORTFOLIO\u2019S NET RISK EXPOSURE TO THAT INPUT. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THEIR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.  89  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  THE FAIR VALUES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON OBSERVABLE PRICES AND INPUTS AND ARE CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 1 AND 2 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. CERTAIN LEVEL 2 AND LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES MAY REQUIRE APPROPRIATE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD REQUIRE TO ARRIVE AT FAIR VALUE FOR FACTORS, SUCH AS COUNTERPARTY AND OUR CREDIT QUALITY, FUNDING RISK, TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS, LIQUIDITY AND BID/OFFER SPREADS.  INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE THOSE WHICH REQUIRE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS THAT ARE NOT OBSERVABLE. LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS REPRESENTED 2.3% AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, AND 2.4% AS OF BOTH JUNE 2019 AND DECEMBER 2018, OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS. SEE NOTES 5 THROUGH 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND RELATED FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. ABSENT EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY, INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE INITIALLY VALUED AT TRANSACTION PRICE, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEST INITIAL ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE. SUBSEQUENT TO THE TRANSACTION DATE, WE USE OTHER METHODOLOGIES TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, WHICH VARY BASED ON THE TYPE OF INSTRUMENT. ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REQUIRES JUDGMENTS TO BE MADE. THESE JUDGMENTS INCLUDE.  \u2022  DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY AND/OR MODEL FOR EACH TYPE OF LEVEL 3 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT;  \u2022  DETERMINING MODEL INPUTS BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF ALL RELEVANT EMPIRICAL MARKET DATA, INCLUDING PRICES EVIDENCED BY MARKET TRANSACTIONS, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS; AND  \u2022  DETERMINING APPROPRIATE VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO ILLIQUIDITY OR COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY.  REGARDLESS OF THE METHODOLOGY, VALUATION INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE ONLY CHANGED WHEN CORROBORATED BY SUBSTANTIVE EVIDENCE.  CONTROLS OVER VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  MARKET MAKERS AND INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS IN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PRICING OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. OUR CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE IS INDEPENDENT OF THE REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ENSURING THAT ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE APPROPRIATELY VALUED AT MARKET-CLEARING LEVELS. IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN SITUATIONS WHERE ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REQUIRES JUDGMENT (E.G., CALIBRATION TO MARKET COMPARABLES OR TRADE COMPARISON, AS DESCRIBED BELOW), THE FINAL VALUATION DECISION IS MADE BY SENIOR MANAGERS IN INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS. THIS INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE PROPERLY VALUED.  PRICE VERIFICATION.  ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE CLASSIFIED IN LEVELS 1, 2 AND 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE SUBJECT TO OUR INDEPENDENT PRICE VERIFICATION PROCESS. THE OBJECTIVE OF PRICE VERIFICATION IS TO HAVE AN INFORMED AND INDEPENDENT OPINION WITH REGARD TO THE VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS UNDER REVIEW. INSTRUMENTS THAT HAVE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS WHICH CANNOT BE CORROBORATED BY EXTERNAL MARKET DATA ARE CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. PRICE VERIFICATION STRATEGIES UTILIZED BY OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS INCLUDE.  \u2022  TRADE COMPARISON.  ANALYSIS OF TRADE DATA (BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL, WHERE AVAILABLE) IS USED TO DETERMINE THE MOST RELEVANT PRICING INPUTS AND VALUATIONS.  \u2022  EXTERNAL PRICE COMPARISON.  VALUATIONS AND PRICES ARE COMPARED TO PRICING DATA OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES (E.G., BROKERS OR DEALERS, MARKIT, BLOOMBERG, IDC, TRACE). DATA OBTAINED FROM VARIOUS SOURCES IS COMPARED TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY AND VALIDITY. WHEN BROKER OR DEALER QUOTATIONS OR THIRD-PARTY PRICING VENDORS ARE USED FOR VALUATION OR PRICE VERIFICATION, GREATER PRIORITY IS GENERALLY GIVEN TO EXECUTABLE QUOTATIONS.  \u2022  CALIBRATION TO MARKET COMPARABLES.  MARKET-BASED TRANSACTIONS ARE USED TO CORROBORATE THE VALUATION OF POSITIONS WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS, RISKS AND COMPONENTS.  \u2022  RELATIVE VALUE ANALYSES.  MARKET-BASED TRANSACTIONS ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE SIMILARITY, MEASURED IN TERMS OF RISK, LIQUIDITY AND RETURN, OF ONE INSTRUMENT RELATIVE TO ANOTHER OR, FOR A GIVEN INSTRUMENT, OF ONE MATURITY RELATIVE TO ANOTHER.  \u2022  COLLATERAL ANALYSES.  MARGIN CALLS ON DERIVATIVES ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE IMPLIED VALUES, WHICH ARE USED TO CORROBORATE OUR VALUATIONS.  \u2022  EXECUTION OF TRADES.  WHERE APPROPRIATE, TRADING DESKS ARE INSTRUCTED TO EXECUTE TRADES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF MARKET-CLEARING LEVELS.  \u2022  BACKTESTING.  VALUATIONS ARE CORROBORATED BY COMPARISON TO VALUES REALIZED UPON SALES.  SEE NOTES 5 THROUGH 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.  REVIEW OF NET REVENUES.  INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS ENSURE ADHERENCE TO OUR PRICING POLICY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DAILY PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THE EXPLANATION AND ATTRIBUTION OF NET REVENUES BASED ON THE UNDERLYING FACTORS. THROUGH THIS PROCESS, WE INDEPENDENTLY VALIDATE NET REVENUES, IDENTIFY AND RESOLVE POTENTIAL FAIR VALUE OR TRADE BOOKING ISSUES ON A TIMELY BASIS AND SEEK TO ENSURE THAT RISKS ARE BEING PROPERLY CATEGORIZED AND QUANTIFIED.  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  90  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  REVIEW OF VALUATION MODELS.  OUR INDEPENDENT MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT GROUP (MODEL RISK), CONSISTING OF QUANTITATIVE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE SEPARATE FROM MODEL DEVELOPERS, PERFORMS AN INDEPENDENT MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION PROCESS OF OUR VALUATION MODELS. NEW OR CHANGED MODELS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION. MODELS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF ANY CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT OR MARKET AND ANY MARKET DEVELOPMENTS IN PRICING THEORIES. SEE \u201cRISK MANAGEMENT \u2014  MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE REVIEW AND VALIDATION OF OUR VALUATION MODELS.  GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS  GOODWILL.  GOODWILL IS THE COST OF ACQUIRED COMPANIES IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AT THE ACQUISITION DATE.  GOODWILL IS ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT INDICATE AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. WHEN ASSESSING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, FIRST, QUALITATIVE FACTORS ARE ASSESSED TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS ESTIMATED CARRYING VALUE. IF THE RESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ARE NOT CONCLUSIVE, A QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL TEST IS PERFORMED BY COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS ESTIMATED CARRYING VALUE.  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WE ASSESSED GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS BY PERFORMING A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT AND DETERMINED THAT GOODWILL FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT WAS NOT IMPAIRED. THERE WERE NO EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019 THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS DID NOT EXCEED ITS RESPECTIVE ESTIMATED CARRYING VALUE AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019. SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT GOODWILL.  ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS. CRITICAL INPUTS TO THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES INCLUDE PROJECTED EARNINGS AND ATTRIBUTED EQUITY. THERE IS INHERENT UNCERTAINTY IN THE PROJECTED EARNINGS. THE ESTIMATED NET BOOK VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT REFLECTS AN ALLOCATION OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AND REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE REPORTING UNIT UNDER CURRENTLY APPLICABLE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. SEE \u201cEQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY CAPITAL\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  IF WE EXPERIENCE A PROLONGED OR SEVERE PERIOD OF WEAKNESS IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, FINANCIAL MARKETS, OUR PERFORMANCE OR OUR COMMON STOCK PRICE, OR ADDITIONAL INCREASES IN CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, OUR GOODWILL COULD BE IMPAIRED IN THE FUTURE.  IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  WE AMORTIZE OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES GENERALLY USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGEST THAT AN ASSET\u2019S OR ASSET GROUP\u2019S CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE.  A PROLONGED OR SEVERE PERIOD OF MARKET WEAKNESS, OR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN REGULATION, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES AND IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN EVENTS COULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING WEAKER BUSINESS PERFORMANCE RESULTING IN A DECREASE IN OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND DECREASES IN REVENUES FROM CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND RELATIONSHIPS. MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO EVALUATE WHETHER INDICATIONS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT HAVE OCCURRED, AND TO TEST INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT, IF REQUIRED.  AN IMPAIRMENT, GENERALLY CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP, IS RECOGNIZED IF THE TOTAL OF THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS RELATING TO THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS LESS THAN THE CORRESPONDING CARRYING VALUE. SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS  SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS.  USE OF ESTIMATES  U.S. GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE ESTIMATES WE MAKE IN CONNECTION WITH FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION ACCRUALS, THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IS ALSO IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS RECEIVABLE AND LENDING COMMITMENTS HELD FOR INVESTMENT, PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS (INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS), AND PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE FROM TAX AUDITS.  91  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS REPRESENTS DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION, WHICH IS FINALIZED AT  YEAR-END.  WE BELIEVE THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY TO ALLOCATE ESTIMATED  YEAR-END  DISCRETIONARY COMPENSATION AMONG INTERIM PERIODS IS IN PROPORTION TO THE NET REVENUES EARNED IN SUCH PERIODS. IN ADDITION TO THE LEVEL OF NET REVENUES, OUR OVERALL COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR IS ALSO INFLUENCED BY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, PREVAILING LABOR MARKETS, BUSINESS MIX, THE STRUCTURE OF OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS AND THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT.  WE ESTIMATE AND RECORD AN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO OUR LOANS RECEIVABLE AND LENDING COMMITMENTS HELD FOR INVESTMENT. MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATE OF CREDIT LOSSES ENTAILS JUDGMENT ABOUT COLLECTABILITY AT THE REPORTING DATES, AND THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN THOSE JUDGMENTS. SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.  WE ALSO ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSSES ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN ADDITION, WE ESTIMATE THE UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE AGGREGATE LOSS IN EXCESS OF THE RELATED RESERVES FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS WHERE WE BELIEVE THE RISK OF LOSS IS MORE THAN SLIGHT. SEE NOTES 18 AND 27 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT CERTAIN JUDICIAL, LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN MAKING THESE ESTIMATES AND OUR FINAL LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT. OUR TOTAL ESTIMATED LIABILITY IN RESPECT OF LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS IS DETERMINED ON A  CASE-BY-CASE  BASIS AND REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES AFTER CONSIDERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE PROGRESS OF EACH CASE, PROCEEDING OR INVESTIGATION, OUR EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS IN SIMILAR CASES, PROCEEDINGS OR INVESTIGATIONS, AND THE OPINIONS AND VIEWS OF LEGAL COUNSEL.  IN ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, WE RECOGNIZE TAX POSITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ONLY WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE RELEVANT TAXING AUTHORITY BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED TRADE TENSIONS AND CONCERNS OVER A SLOWDOWN IN FUTURE GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. VOLATILITY IN EQUITY MARKETS INCREASED IN AUGUST AND THE AVERAGE DAILY VIX FOR THE QUARTER WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.

AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  THE DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES COMPARED WITH THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018 WAS DUE TO LOWER COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, REFLECTING A DECLINE IN OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND LOWER NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EXPENSES RELATED TO CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS AND TECHNOLOGY (INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, OCCUPANCY, COMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY, AND OTHER EXPENSES), AS WELL AS HIGHER EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR CREDIT CARD ACTIVITIES (INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY IN PROFESSIONAL FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES).  NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 WERE $150 MILLION COMPARED WITH $328 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018.  HEADCOUNT INCREASED 3% COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 2018.  PROVISION FOR TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 WAS 20.7%, UP FROM THE FULL YEAR TAX RATE OF 16.2% FOR 2018, WHICH INCLUDED A $487 MILLION INCOME TAX BENEFIT IN 2018 RELATED TO THE FINALIZATION OF THE IMPACT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (TAX LEGISLATION). THE INCREASE COMPARED WITH 20.1% FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE IMPACT OF PERMANENT TAX BENEFITS IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED WITH THE FIRST HALF OF 2019.  TAX LEGISLATION REDUCED THE U.S. CORPORATE TAX RATE TO 21%, ELIMINATED TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR CERTAIN EXPENSES AND ENACTED TWO NEW TAXES, BASE EROSION AND ANTI-ABUSE TAX (BEAT) AND GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW TAXED INCOME (GILTI). BEAT IS AN ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX THAT APPLIES TO BANKS THAT PAY MORE THAN 2% OF TOTAL DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES TO CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. GILTI IS EFFECTIVELY A 10.5% TAX, BEFORE ALLOWABLE CREDITS FOR FOREIGN TAXES PAID, ON THE ANNUAL TAXABLE INCOME OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. INCOME TAX EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH GILTI IS RECOGNIZED AS INCURRED. IN JUNE 2019, THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY (U.S. TREASURY) RELEASED FINAL, TEMPORARY AND PROPOSED REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GILTI. THE FINAL AND TEMPORARY REGULATIONS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 AND THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS WOULD BE APPLICABLE ONLY AFTER FINAL REGULATIONS ARE PUBLISHED. IN 2018, THE IRS AND U.S. TREASURY ISSUED PROPOSED REGULATIONS RELATING TO BEAT AND GILTI. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 INCLUDES ESTIMATES FOR BEAT AND GILTI THAT ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT INTERPRETATION OF THESE PROPOSED REGULATIONS. WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE FINALIZATION OF THESE PROPOSED REGULATIONS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THESE ESTIMATES. HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE ESTIMATES ARE MATERIALLY IMPACTED IF THE FINAL REGULATIONS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM OUR CURRENT INTERPRETATION OF THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS.  BASED ON OUR CURRENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE RULES AND LEGISLATIVE GUIDANCE TO DATE, WE EXPECT OUR 2019 TAX RATE TO BE APPROXIMATELY 22%.

IN THE FUTURE, IF INDUSTRY-WIDE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS TRANSACTIONS CONTINUE TO DECLINE, OR IF INDUSTRY-WIDE EQUITY OR DEBT UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS CONTINUE TO DECLINE, NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT BANKING WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG INCREASED COMPARED WITH JUNE 2019, DUE TO HIGHER ESTIMATED NET REVENUES FROM POTENTIAL ADVISORY TRANSACTIONS AND HIGHER ESTIMATED NET REVENUES FROM POTENTIAL DEBT UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY FROM INVESTMENT-GRADE AND LEVERAGED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SLIGHTLY LOWER ESTIMATED NET REVENUES FROM POTENTIAL EQUITY UNDERWRITING TRANSACTIONS.  97  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

WE BELIEVE CHANGES IN OUR INVESTMENT BANKING TRANSACTION BACKLOG MAY BE A USEFUL INDICATOR OF CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS WHICH, OVER THE LONG TERM, IMPACT OUR NET REVENUES. HOWEVER, THE TIME FRAME FOR COMPLETION AND CORRESPONDING REVENUE RECOGNITION OF TRANSACTIONS IN OUR BACKLOG VARIES BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE ASSIGNMENT, AS CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS MAY REMAIN IN OUR BACKLOG FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME AND OTHERS MAY ENTER AND LEAVE WITHIN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD. IN ADDITION, OUR TRANSACTION BACKLOG IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS, SUCH AS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT INDIVIDUAL CLIENT TRANSACTIONS WILL OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. TRANSACTIONS MAY BE CANCELLED OR MODIFIED, AND TRANSACTIONS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ESTIMATE MAY ALSO OCCUR.  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019 VERSUS SEPTEMBER 2018.

NET REVENUES IN UNDERWRITING WERE $2.98 BILLION, 15% LOWER COMPARED WITH A STRONG FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018, DUE TO LOWER NET REVENUES IN DEBT UNDERWRITING, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE LEVERAGED FINANCE ACTIVITY, AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING, REFLECTING A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN INDUSTRY-WIDE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS.  OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $3.01 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, 10% LOWER THAN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018, DUE TO DECREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, REFLECTING A DECLINE IN OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND LOWER NET PROVISIONS FOR LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  98  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES  AS A MARKET MAKER, WE FACILITATE TRANSACTIONS IN BOTH LIQUID AND LESS LIQUID MARKETS, PRIMARILY FOR INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS, SUCH AS CORPORATIONS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INVESTMENT FUNDS AND GOVERNMENTS, TO ASSIST CLIENTS IN MEETING THEIR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND IN MANAGING THEIR RISKS. IN THIS ROLE, WE SEEK TO EARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRICE AT WHICH A MARKET PARTICIPANT IS WILLING TO SELL AN INSTRUMENT TO US AND THE PRICE AT WHICH ANOTHER MARKET PARTICIPANT IS WILLING TO BUY IT FROM US, AND VICE VERSA (I.E., BID/OFFER SPREAD). IN ADDITION, WE MAINTAIN INVENTORY, TYPICALLY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, IN RESPONSE TO, OR IN ANTICIPATION OF, CLIENT DEMAND. WE ALSO HOLD INVENTORY TO ACTIVELY MANAGE OUR RISK EXPOSURES THAT ARISE FROM THESE MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES. OUR MARKET-MAKING INVENTORY IS RECORDED IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED (LONG POSITIONS) OR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED (SHORT POSITIONS) IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION.  OUR RESULTS ARE INFLUENCED BY A COMBINATION OF INTERCONNECTED DRIVERS, INCLUDING (I) CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS AND TRANSACTIONAL BID/OFFER SPREADS (COLLECTIVELY, CLIENT ACTIVITY), AND (II) CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY AND INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE HOLDING, HEDGING AND FUNDING OF OUR INVENTORY (COLLECTIVELY, MARKET-MAKING INVENTORY CHANGES). DUE TO THE INTEGRATED NATURE OF OUR MARKET-MAKING ACTIVITIES, DISAGGREGATION OF NET REVENUES INTO CLIENT ACTIVITY AND MARKET-MAKING INVENTORY CHANGES IS JUDGMENTAL AND HAS INHERENT COMPLEXITIES AND LIMITATIONS.  THE AMOUNT AND COMPOSITION OF OUR NET REVENUES VARY OVER TIME AS THESE DRIVERS ARE IMPACTED BY MULTIPLE INTERRELATED FACTORS AFFECTING ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY AND LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CREDIT SPREADS, EQUITY PRICES AND COMMODITY PRICES, INVESTOR CONFIDENCE, AND OTHER MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS AND UNCERTAINTIES.  IN GENERAL, ASSUMING ALL OTHER MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS REMAIN CONSTANT, INCREASES IN CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS OR BID/OFFER SPREADS TEND TO RESULT IN INCREASES IN NET REVENUES, AND DECREASES TEND TO HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT. HOWEVER, CHANGES IN MARKET-MAKING CONDITIONS CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS AND BID/OFFER SPREADS, AS WELL AS THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY. FOR EXAMPLE, A DECREASE IN LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET COULD HAVE THE IMPACT OF (I) INCREASING OUR BID/OFFER SPREAD, (II) DECREASING INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AND THEREBY DECREASING CLIENT ACTIVITY LEVELS, AND (III) WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS ON OUR INVENTORY POSITIONS.

AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OPERATING ENVIRONMENT.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES OPERATED IN AN ENVIRONMENT GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS WHICH WEIGHED ON MARKET SENTIMENT, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED TRADE TENSIONS AND CONCERNS OVER A SLOWDOWN IN FUTURE GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. IN ADDITION, MONETARY POLICIES SET BY GLOBAL CENTRAL BANKS REMAINED ACCOMMODATIVE, INCLUDING TWO RATE CUTS BY THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, MARKET CONDITIONS WERE MIXED AS VOLATILITY INCREASED (THE AVERAGE DAILY VIX WAS 43% HIGHER IN AUGUST COMPARED WITH JULY, WHILE AVERAGE DAILY VIX WAS 16 FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED WITH 15 FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019), THE YIELD CURVE FOR THE U.S. TREASURY  2-YEAR  NOTE VERSUS THE  10-YEAR  NOTE TEMPORARILY INVERTED FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2007 AND GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS REBOUNDED IN SEPTEMBER FOLLOWING DECLINES IN AUGUST (MSCI WORLD INDEX DECREASED 1% COMPARED WITH JUNE 2019). THESE CONDITIONS CONTRIBUTED TO SOLID CLIENT ACTIVITY IN FICC CLIENT EXECUTION, WHILE CLIENT ACTIVITY IN EQUITIES WAS LOWER COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. IF ACTIVITY LEVELS DECLINE, OR VOLATILITY DECLINES, OR IF MACROECONOMIC CONCERNS CONTINUE, NET REVENUES IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES WOULD LIKELY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019 VERSUS SEPTEMBER 2018.  NET REVENUES IN INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES WERE $3.29 BILLION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, 6% HIGHER THAN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.

FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, APPROXIMATELY 90% OF THE NET REVENUES IN FICC CLIENT EXECUTION WERE GENERATED FROM MARKET INTERMEDIATION AND APPROXIMATELY 10% WERE GENERATED FROM FINANCING.

NET REVENUES IN EQUITIES WERE $1.88 BILLION, 5% HIGHER THAN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER COMMISSIONS AND FEES, REFLECTING INCREASED CLIENT ACTIVITY.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, OUR ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED FROM ORGANIC NET INFLOWS IN LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS, ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS ASSETS AND FIXED INCOME ASSETS, AND APPRECIATION IN OUR CLIENT ASSETS, REFLECTING GENERALLY HIGHER FIXED INCOME PRICES. IN ADDITION, WE INCREASED ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS. THE MIX OF OUR AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION BETWEEN LONG-TERM ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION AND LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS WAS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. IN THE FUTURE, IF ASSET PRICES DECLINE, OR INVESTORS FAVOR ASSETS THAT TYPICALLY GENERATE LOWER FEES OR INVESTORS WITHDRAW THEIR ASSETS, NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT WOULD LIKELY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019 VERSUS SEPTEMBER 2018.  NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT WERE $1.67 BILLION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, 2% LOWER THAN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER INCENTIVE FEES. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES (INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION OF UNITED CAPITAL), REFLECTING HIGHER AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER AVERAGE EFFECTIVE FEE DUE TO SHIFTS IN THE MIX OF CLIENT ASSETS AND STRATEGIES.  DURING THE QUARTER, TOTAL ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED $102 BILLION (WHICH INCLUDED $58 BILLION OF INFLOWS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SPIAS AND UNITED CAPITAL ACQUISITIONS) TO $1.76 TRILLION. LONG-TERM ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED $85 BILLION, INCLUDING NET INFLOWS OF $69 BILLION, PRIMARILY IN EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME ASSETS, AND NET MARKET APPRECIATION OF $16 BILLION, PRIMARILY IN FIXED INCOME ASSETS. LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS INCREASED $17 BILLION.  OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $1.35 BILLION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, 2% HIGHER THAN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES RELATED TO UNITED CAPITAL.  PRE-TAX  EARNINGS WERE $319 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, 17% LOWER THAN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019 VERSUS SEPTEMBER 2018.  NET REVENUES IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT WERE $4.82 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, 9% LOWER THAN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER INCENTIVE FEES. IN ADDITION, TRANSACTION REVENUES WERE LOWER. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SLIGHTLY HIGHER MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES (INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION OF UNITED CAPITAL), REFLECTING HIGHER AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER AVERAGE EFFECTIVE FEE DUE TO SHIFTS IN THE MIX OF CLIENT ASSETS AND STRATEGIES.  DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, TOTAL ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED $220 BILLION (WHICH INCLUDED $71 BILLION OF INFLOWS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SPIAS, UNITED CAPITAL AND ROCATON ACQUISITIONS) TO $1.76 TRILLION. LONG-TERM ASSETS UNDER SUPERVISION INCREASED $213 BILLION, INCLUDING NET MARKET APPRECIATION OF $107 BILLION AND NET INFLOWS OF $106 BILLION, BOTH PRIMARILY IN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY ASSETS. LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS INCREASED $7 BILLION.  OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $3.97 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, 4% LOWER THAN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018, DUE TO DECREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES, REFLECTING A DECLINE IN OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  PRE-TAX  EARNINGS WERE $845 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, 27% LOWER THAN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018.

AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  BALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING SOURCES  BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT  ONE OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINES IS OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF OUR BALANCE SHEET. WHILE OUR ASSET BASE CHANGES DUE TO CLIENT ACTIVITY, MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF OUR BALANCE SHEET ALSO REFLECTS FACTORS INCLUDING (I) OUR OVERALL RISK TOLERANCE, (II) THE AMOUNT OF EQUITY CAPITAL WE HOLD AND (III) OUR FUNDING PROFILE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. SEE \u201cEQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY CAPITAL \u2014 EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT PROCESS.  ALTHOUGH OUR BALANCE SHEET FLUCTUATES ON A  DAY-TO-DAY  BASIS, OUR TOTAL ASSETS AT  QUARTER-END  AND  YEAR-END  DATES ARE GENERALLY NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OCCURRING WITHIN OUR REPORTING PERIODS.  IN ORDER TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE RISK MANAGEMENT, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A SUFFICIENTLY LIQUID BALANCE SHEET AND HAVE PROCESSES IN PLACE TO DYNAMICALLY MANAGE OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH INCLUDE (I) BALANCE SHEET PLANNING, (II) BALANCE SHEET LIMITS, (III) MONITORING OF KEY METRICS AND (IV) SCENARIO ANALYSES.  BALANCE SHEET PLANNING.  WE PREPARE A BALANCE SHEET PLAN THAT COMBINES OUR PROJECTED TOTAL ASSETS AND COMPOSITION OF ASSETS WITH OUR EXPECTED FUNDING SOURCES OVER A THREE-YEAR TIME HORIZON. THIS PLAN IS REVIEWED QUARTERLY AND MAY BE ADJUSTED IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING BUSINESS NEEDS OR MARKET CONDITIONS. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PLANNING PROCESS ARE.  \u2022  TO DEVELOP OUR BALANCE SHEET PROJECTIONS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE GENERAL STATE OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND EXPECTED BUSINESS ACTIVITY LEVELS, AS WELL AS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS;  \u2022  TO ALLOW TREASURY AND OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS TO OBJECTIVELY EVALUATE BALANCE SHEET LIMIT REQUESTS FROM OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR OVERALL BALANCE SHEET CONSTRAINTS, INCLUDING OUR LIABILITY PROFILE AND EQUITY CAPITAL LEVELS, AND KEY METRICS; AND  \u2022  TO INFORM THE TARGET AMOUNT, TENOR AND TYPE OF FUNDING TO RAISE, BASED ON OUR PROJECTED ASSETS AND CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES.  TREASURY AND OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS, ALONG WITH OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, REVIEW CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION AND EXPECTATIONS FOR THE YEAR TO PREPARE OUR BALANCE SHEET PLAN. THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION REVIEWED INCLUDES ASSET AND LIABILITY SIZE AND COMPOSITION, LIMIT UTILIZATION, RISK AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES, AND CAPITAL USAGE.  OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET PLAN, INCLUDING OUR BALANCE SHEETS BY BUSINESS, FUNDING PROJECTIONS AND PROJECTED KEY METRICS, IS REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE FIRMWIDE ASSET LIABILITY COMMITTEE AND THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE. SEE \u201cRISK MANAGEMENT \u2014 OVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR AN OVERVIEW OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE.  BALANCE SHEET LIMITS.  THE FIRMWIDE ASSET LIABILITY COMMITTEE AND THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO REVIEW AND APPROVE BALANCE SHEET LIMITS. THESE LIMITS ARE SET AT LEVELS WHICH ARE CLOSE TO ACTUAL OPERATING LEVELS, RATHER THAN AT LEVELS WHICH REFLECT OUR MAXIMUM RISK APPETITE, IN ORDER TO ENSURE PROMPT ESCALATION AND DISCUSSION AMONG OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, TREASURY AND OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS ON A ROUTINE BASIS. ADDITIONALLY, THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE SETS AGED INVENTORY LIMITS FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS A DISINCENTIVE TO HOLD INVENTORY OVER LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. REQUESTS FOR CHANGES IN LIMITS ARE EVALUATED AFTER GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THEIR IMPACT ON OUR KEY METRICS. COMPLIANCE WITH LIMITS IS MONITORED BY OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND TREASURY, AS WELL AS OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS.  MONITORING OF KEY METRICS.  WE MONITOR KEY BALANCE SHEET METRICS BOTH BY BUSINESS AND ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, INCLUDING ASSET AND LIABILITY SIZE AND COMPOSITION, LIMIT UTILIZATION AND RISK MEASURES. WE ALLOCATE ASSETS TO BUSINESSES AND REVIEW AND ANALYZE MOVEMENTS RESULTING FROM NEW BUSINESS ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS MARKET FLUCTUATIONS.  SCENARIO ANALYSES.  WE CONDUCT VARIOUS SCENARIO ANALYSES INCLUDING AS PART OF THE COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (CCAR) AND U.S. DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (DODD-FRANK ACT) STRESS TESTS (DFAST), AS WELL AS OUR RESOLUTION AND RECOVERY PLANNING. SEE \u201cEQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY CAPITAL \u2014 EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THESE SCENARIO ANALYSES. THESE SCENARIOS COVER SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM TIME HORIZONS USING VARIOUS MACROECONOMIC AND FIRM-SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS, BASED ON A RANGE OF ECONOMIC SCENARIOS. WE USE THESE ANALYSES TO ASSIST US IN DEVELOPING OUR LONGER-TERM BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT STRATEGY, INCLUDING THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF ASSETS, FUNDING AND EQUITY CAPITAL. ADDITIONALLY, THESE ANALYSES HELP US DEVELOP APPROACHES FOR MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE FUNDING, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL ACROSS A VARIETY OF SITUATIONS, INCLUDING A SEVERELY STRESSED ENVIRONMENT.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS AND METRICS  AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, TOTAL ASSETS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WERE $1.01 TRILLION, AN INCREASE OF $75.52 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 2018, PRIMARILY REFLECTING INCREASES IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED OF $88.83 BILLION AND OTHER ASSETS OF $10.00 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $36.45 BILLION. THE INCREASE IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER CLIENT ACTIVITY IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS. THE INCREASE IN OTHER ASSETS PRIMARILY REFLECTED PURCHASES OF  HELD-TO-MATURITY  SECURITIES AND RECOGNITION OF OPERATING LEASE  RIGHT-OF-USE  ASSETS UPON ADOPTION OF ASU NO.  2016-02.  THE DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF OUR ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN OUR GCLA.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, TOTAL LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION WERE $915.31 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $73.70 BILLION FROM DECEMBER 2018, PRIMARILY REFLECTING INCREASES IN COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS OF $27.83 BILLION, DEPOSITS OF $24.45 BILLION, CUSTOMER AND OTHER PAYABLES OF $7.93 BILLION, AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED OF $7.53 BILLION. THE INCREASE IN COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF OUR AND OUR CLIENTS\u2019 ACTIVITY. THE INCREASE IN DEPOSITS REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN CONSUMER DEPOSITS. THE INCREASE IN CUSTOMER AND OTHER PAYABLES PRIMARILY REFLECTED CLIENT ACTIVITY. THE INCREASE IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SOLD, BUT NOT YET PURCHASED REFLECTED CLIENT ACTIVITY IN U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS.  OUR TOTAL REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, ACCOUNTED FOR AS COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS, WERE $109.44 BILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019 AND $78.72 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2018, WHICH WERE 23% HIGHER AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019 AND 1% HIGHER AS OF DECEMBER 2018 THAN THE AVERAGE DAILY AMOUNT OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OVER THE RESPECTIVE QUARTERS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, THE INCREASE IN OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE AVERAGE DAILY AMOUNT OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS DURING THE QUARTER RESULTED FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF OUR AND OUR CLIENTS\u2019 ACTIVITY AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.  THE LEVEL OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FLUCTUATES BETWEEN AND WITHIN PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO PROVIDING CLIENTS WITH ACCESS TO HIGHLY LIQUID COLLATERAL, SUCH AS LIQUID GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, THROUGH COLLATERALIZED FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  107  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR CREDITORS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR LIQUIDITY. OUR CREDITORS INCLUDE BANKS, GOVERNMENTS, SECURITIES LENDERS, CORPORATIONS, PENSION FUNDS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, MUTUAL FUNDS AND INDIVIDUALS. WE HAVE IMPOSED VARIOUS INTERNAL GUIDELINES TO MONITOR CREDITOR CONCENTRATION ACROSS OUR FUNDING PROGRAMS.  DEPOSITS.  OUR DEPOSITS PROVIDE US WITH A DIVERSIFIED SOURCE OF FUNDING AND REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON WHOLESALE FUNDING. A GROWING PORTION OF OUR DEPOSIT BASE CONSISTS OF CONSUMER DEPOSITS. DEPOSITS ARE PRIMARILY USED TO FINANCE LENDING ACTIVITY, OTHER INVENTORY AND A PORTION OF OUR GCLA. WE RAISE DEPOSITS, INCLUDING SAVINGS, DEMAND AND TIME DEPOSITS, THROUGH INTERNAL AND THIRD-PARTY BROKER-DEALERS, AND FROM CONSUMERS AND INSTITUTIONAL CLIENTS, AND PRIMARILY THROUGH GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA (GS BANK USA) AND GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL BANK (GSIB).

SECURED FUNDING INCLUDES COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE MAY ALSO PLEDGE OUR INVENTORY AS COLLATERAL FOR SECURITIES BORROWED UNDER A SECURITIES LENDING AGREEMENT. WE ALSO USE OUR OWN INVENTORY TO COVER TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH WE OR OUR CLIENTS HAVE SOLD SECURITIES THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN PURCHASED. SECURED FUNDING IS LESS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT QUALITY THAN UNSECURED FUNDING, DUE TO OUR POSTING OF COLLATERAL TO OUR LENDERS. NONETHELESS, WE CONTINUALLY ANALYZE THE REFINANCING RISK OF OUR SECURED FUNDING ACTIVITIES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT TRADE TENORS, MATURITY PROFILES, COUNTERPARTY CONCENTRATIONS, COLLATERAL ELIGIBILITY AND COUNTERPARTY ROLL OVER PROBABILITIES. WE SEEK TO MITIGATE OUR REFINANCING RISK BY EXECUTING TERM TRADES WITH STAGGERED MATURITIES, DIVERSIFYING COUNTERPARTIES, RAISING EXCESS SECURED FUNDING AND  PRE-FUNDING  RESIDUAL RISK THROUGH OUR GCLA.  WE SEEK TO RAISE SECURED FUNDING WITH A TERM APPROPRIATE FOR THE LIQUIDITY OF THE ASSETS THAT ARE BEING FINANCED, AND WE SEEK LONGER MATURITIES FOR SECURED FUNDING COLLATERALIZED BY ASSET CLASSES THAT MAY BE HARDER TO FUND ON A SECURED BASIS, ESPECIALLY DURING TIMES OF MARKET STRESS. OUR SECURED FUNDING, EXCLUDING FUNDING COLLATERALIZED BY LIQUID GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, IS PRIMARILY EXECUTED FOR TENORS OF ONE MONTH OR GREATER AND IS PRIMARILY EXECUTED THROUGH TERM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES LOANED CONTRACTS.  THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR SECURED FUNDING INCLUDED IN COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, EXCLUDING FUNDING THAT CAN ONLY BE COLLATERALIZED BY LIQUID GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, EXCEEDED 120 DAYS AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019.  ASSETS THAT MAY BE HARDER TO FUND ON A SECURED BASIS DURING TIMES OF MARKET STRESS INCLUDE CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: MORTGAGE AND OTHER ASSET-BACKED LOANS AND SECURITIES,  NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE  CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, EQUITY SECURITIES AND EMERGING MARKET SECURITIES. ASSETS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3 OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY ARE GENERALLY FUNDED ON AN UNSECURED BASIS.

OUR OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AGAINST THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK WERE $503 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019 AND $528 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 2018.  GS BANK USA ALSO HAS ACCESS TO FUNDING THROUGH THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK DISCOUNT WINDOW. WHILE WE DO NOT RELY ON THIS FUNDING IN OUR LIQUIDITY PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING, WE MAINTAIN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES NECESSARY TO ACCESS THIS FUNDING AND TEST DISCOUNT WINDOW BORROWING PROCEDURES.  UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR UNSECURED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS WAS ORIGINALLY LONG-TERM DEBT THAT IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE REPORTING DATE.

EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY CAPITAL  CAPITAL ADEQUACY IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO US. WE HAVE IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICY THAT PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK, DEFINES OBJECTIVES AND ESTABLISHES GUIDELINES TO ASSIST US IN MAINTAINING THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF CAPITAL IN BOTH  BUSINESS-AS-USUAL  AND STRESSED CONDITIONS.  EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  WE DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL BY CONSIDERING MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE RESULTS OF OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS, THE RESULTS OF RESOLUTION CAPITAL MODELS AND OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS RATING AGENCY GUIDELINES, SUBSIDIARY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND CONDITIONS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS.  WE MANAGE OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND THE LEVELS OF OUR CAPITAL USAGE PRINCIPALLY BY SETTING LIMITS ON BALANCE SHEET ASSETS AND/OR LIMITS ON RISK, IN EACH CASE AT BOTH THE FIRMWIDE AND BUSINESS LEVELS.  WE PRINCIPALLY MANAGE THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL THROUGH ISSUANCES AND REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE MAY ALSO, FROM TIME TO TIME, ISSUE OR REPURCHASE OUR PREFERRED STOCK, JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS, AND OTHER SUBORDINATED DEBT OR OTHER FORMS OF CAPITAL AS BUSINESS CONDITIONS WARRANT. PRIOR TO ANY REPURCHASES, WE MUST RECEIVE CONFIRMATION THAT THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FRB) DOES NOT OBJECT TO SUCH CAPITAL ACTION. SEE NOTES 16 AND 19 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PREFERRED STOCK, JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED TO TRUSTS AND OTHER SUBORDINATED DEBT.  CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS.  AS PART OF CAPITAL PLANNING, WE PROJECT SOURCES AND USES OF CAPITAL GIVEN A RANGE OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING STRESSED CONDITIONS. OUR STRESS TESTING PROCESS IS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY AND MEASURE MATERIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK, AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES.  THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS.  \u2022  CAPITAL PLANNING.  OUR CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS INCORPORATES AN INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ENSURING THAT WE ARE APPROPRIATELY CAPITALIZED RELATIVE TO THE RISKS IN OUR BUSINESSES. WE INCORPORATE STRESS SCENARIOS INTO OUR CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS WITH A GOAL OF HOLDING SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ENSURE WE REMAIN ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED AFTER EXPERIENCING A SEVERE STRESS EVENT. OUR ASSESSMENT OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY IS VIEWED IN TANDEM WITH OUR ASSESSMENT OF LIQUIDITY ADEQUACY AND IS INTEGRATED INTO OUR OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE, GOVERNANCE AND POLICY FRAMEWORK.  OUR CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS ALSO INCLUDES AN INTERNAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL ASSESSMENT. THIS ASSESSMENT INCORPORATES MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK. MARKET RISK IS CALCULATED BY USING  VALUE-AT-RISK  (VAR) CALCULATIONS SUPPLEMENTED BY RISK-BASED  ADD-ONS  WHICH INCLUDE RISKS RELATED TO RARE EVENTS (TAIL RISKS). CREDIT RISK UTILIZES ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT OUR COUNTERPARTIES\u2019 PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT AND THE SIZE OF OUR LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT. OPERATIONAL RISK IS CALCULATED BASED ON SCENARIOS INCORPORATING MULTIPLE TYPES OF OPERATIONAL FAILURES, AS WELL AS CONSIDERING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ACTUAL LOSS EXPERIENCE. BACKTESTING FOR MARKET RISK AND CREDIT RISK IS USED TO GAUGE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MODELS AT CAPTURING AND MEASURING RELEVANT RISKS.  \u2022  STRESS TESTING.  OUR STRESS TESTS INCORPORATE OUR INTERNALLY DESIGNED STRESS SCENARIOS, INCLUDING OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SEVERELY ADVERSE SCENARIO, AND THOSE REQUIRED UNDER CCAR AND DFAST, AND ARE DESIGNED TO CAPTURE OUR SPECIFIC VULNERABILITIES AND RISKS. WE PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR STRESS TEST PROCESSES AND A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS ON OUR WEBSITE AS DESCRIBED IN \u201cAVAILABLE INFORMATION.\u201d  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  110  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  AS REQUIRED BY THE FRB\u2019S ANNUAL CCAR RULES, WE SUBMIT A CAPITAL PLAN FOR REVIEW BY THE FRB. THE PURPOSE OF THE FRB\u2019S REVIEW IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST, FORWARD-LOOKING CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS THAT ACCOUNTS FOR OUR UNIQUE RISKS AND THAT PERMITS CONTINUED OPERATION DURING TIMES OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL STRESS.  THE FRB EVALUATES US BASED, IN PART, ON WHETHER WE HAVE THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO CONTINUE OPERATING UNDER THE BASELINE AND STRESS SCENARIOS PROVIDED BY THE FRB AND THOSE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY. THIS EVALUATION ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT OUR PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING RISK, OUR CONTROLS AND GOVERNANCE FOR CAPITAL PLANNING, AND OUR GUIDELINES FOR MAKING CAPITAL PLANNING DECISIONS. IN ADDITION, THE FRB EVALUATES OUR PLAN TO MAKE CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS (I.E., DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND REPURCHASES OR REDEMPTIONS OF STOCK, SUBORDINATED DEBT OR OTHER CAPITAL SECURITIES) AND ISSUE CAPITAL, ACROSS THE RANGE OF MACROECONOMIC SCENARIOS AND FIRM-SPECIFIC ASSUMPTIONS.  IN MARCH 2019, THE FRB REVISED ITS CCAR RULES RELATING TO THE QUALITATIVE CCAR REVIEW. ACCORDINGLY, BEGINNING WITH CCAR 2019, WHILE THE FRB EVALUATES OUR CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESS, OUR CAPITAL PLAN IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO A POTENTIAL QUALITATIVE OBJECTION.  WITH RESPECT TO OUR 2019 CCAR SUBMISSION, THE FRB INFORMED US THAT IT DID NOT OBJECT TO OUR CAPITAL PLAN, WHICH INCLUDES THE RETURN OF UP TO $8.8 BILLION OF CAPITAL FROM THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 (2019 CCAR CYCLE). THE CAPITAL PLAN PROVIDES FOR UP TO $7.0 BILLION IN REPURCHASES OF OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK AND $1.8 BILLION IN TOTAL COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN OUR COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND FROM $0.85 TO $1.25 PER SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE RETURNED A TOTAL OF $1.14 BILLION OF CAPITAL, INCLUDING STOCK REPURCHASES OF $673 MILLION AND COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS OF $466 MILLION. OUR STOCK REPURCHASE AMOUNT WAS LESS THAN THE QUARTERLY AMOUNT OF $1.75 BILLION INCLUDED IN OUR CAPITAL PLAN SUBMISSION AND THE UNUTILIZED AMOUNT WILL BE CARRIED FORWARD TO THE REMAINING THREE QUARTERS OF THE 2019 CCAR CYCLE. WE MAY ELECT TO EXECUTE A PORTION OR ALL OF OUR CAPITAL ACTIONS, BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR CURRENT AND PROJECTED CAPITAL POSITION, AND CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. BASED ON THE FRB\u2019S 2019 CCAR RESULTS AND THE PROPOSED STRESS CAPITAL BUFFER (SCB) RULE, WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR CET1 RATIO REQUIREMENT WILL BE BETWEEN 12.5% TO 13.0% (EXCLUDING MANAGEMENT BUFFERS). THIS ESTIMATE IS BASED ON OUR CALCULATIONS AND OUR CURRENT INTERPRETATION OF THE PROPOSED SCB RULE AND MAY CHANGE WHEN THE RULE IS FINALIZED AND IMPLEMENTED. WE PUBLISHED A SUMMARY OF OUR ANNUAL DFAST RESULTS IN JUNE 2019. SEE \u201cAVAILABLE INFORMATION.\u201d  IN OCTOBER 2019, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DFAST RULES, WE SUBMITTED OUR  MID-CYCLE  DFAST RESULTS TO THE FRB AND PUBLISHED A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SEVERELY ADVERSE SCENARIO. THE FRB ELIMINATED THE REQUIREMENT TO CONDUCT THE MID-CYCLE DFAST BEGINNING IN 2020. WE ARE STILL REQUIRED TO CONDUCT A STRESS TEST ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND PUBLISH A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS. THE FRB ALSO CONDUCTS ITS OWN ANNUAL STRESS TESTS AND PUBLISHES A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN RESULTS. SEE \u201cAVAILABLE INFORMATION.\u201d  GS BANK USA WAS NOT REQUIRED TO CONDUCT ITS ANNUAL STRESS TEST IN 2019.  GOLDMAN SACHS INTERNATIONAL (GSI) AND GSIB ALSO HAVE THEIR OWN CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS, WHICH INCORPORATES INTERNALLY DESIGNED STRESS TESTS AND THOSE REQUIRED UNDER THE PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY\u2019S (PRA) INTERNAL CAPITAL ADEQUACY ASSESSMENT PROCESS.  CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN.  AS PART OF OUR COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT POLICY, WE MAINTAIN A CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN. OUR CONTINGENCY CAPITAL PLAN PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING TO A PERCEIVED OR ACTUAL CAPITAL DEFICIENCY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IDENTIFICATION OF DRIVERS OF A CAPITAL DEFICIENCY, AS WELL AS MITIGANTS AND POTENTIAL ACTIONS. IT OUTLINES THE APPROPRIATE COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW DURING A CRISIS PERIOD, INCLUDING INTERNAL DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION, AS WELL AS TIMELY COMMUNICATION WITH EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS.  CAPITAL ATTRIBUTION.  WE ASSESS EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES\u2019 CAPITAL USAGE BASED ON OUR INTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF RISKS, WHICH INCORPORATES AN ATTRIBUTION OF ALL OF OUR RELEVANT REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THESE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE ALLOCATED USING OUR ATTRIBUTED EQUITY FRAMEWORK, WHICH TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION OUR MOST BINDING CAPITAL CONSTRAINTS. OUR MOST BINDING CAPITAL CONSTRAINT IS BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE FRB\u2019S ANNUAL STRESS TEST SCENARIOS WHICH INCLUDE THE STANDARDIZED RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND LEVERAGE RATIOS.  WE ALSO ATTRIBUTE RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (RWAS) TO OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, APPROXIMATELY 55% OF RWAS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDIZED CAPITAL RULES AND APPROXIMATELY 50% OF RWAS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADVANCED CAPITAL RULES, WERE ATTRIBUTED TO OUR INSTITUTIONAL CLIENT SERVICES SEGMENT AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING RWAS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO OUR INVESTING & LENDING SEGMENT. WE MANAGE THE LEVELS OF OUR CAPITAL USAGE BASED ON BALANCE SHEET AND RISK LIMITS, AS WELL AS CAPITAL RETURN ANALYSES OF OUR BUSINESSES BASED ON OUR CAPITAL ATTRIBUTION.  111  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  WE USE OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO HELP MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF COMMON EQUITY. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EFFECTED PRIMARILY THROUGH REGULAR OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES (WHICH MAY INCLUDE REPURCHASE PLANS DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH RULE  10B5-1),  THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF WHICH ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY BY OUR CURRENT AND PROJECTED CAPITAL POSITION AND OUR CAPITAL PLAN SUBMITTED TO THE FRB AS PART OF CCAR. THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF THE REPURCHASES MAY ALSO BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE PREVAILING PRICE AND TRADING VOLUMES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  ON JULY 15, 2019, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF GROUP INC. (BOARD) AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL 50 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO OUR EXISTING SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM; HOWEVER, WE ARE ONLY PERMITTED TO MAKE REPURCHASES TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH REPURCHASES HAVE NOT BEEN OBJECTED TO BY THE FRB. AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, THE REMAINING SHARE AUTHORIZATION UNDER OUR EXISTING REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS 68.0 MILLION SHARES.

RESOLUTION CAPITAL MODELS.  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR RESOLUTION PLANNING EFFORTS, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A RESOLUTION CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND POSITIONING FRAMEWORK, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT OUR MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES (GS BANK USA, GOLDMAN SACHS & CO. LLC (GS&CO.), GSI, GSIB, GOLDMAN SACHS JAPAN CO., LTD. (GSJCL), GOLDMAN SACHS ASSET MANAGEMENT, L.P. AND GOLDMAN SACHS ASSET MANAGEMENT INTERNATIONAL) HAVE ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT LOSS-ABSORBING CAPACITY (IN THE FORM OF EQUITY, SUBORDINATED DEBT AND UNSECURED SENIOR DEBT) SO THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO WIND-DOWN FOLLOWING A GROUP INC.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A TRIGGERS AND ALERTS FRAMEWORK, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE BOARD WITH INFORMATION NEEDED TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON WHETHER AND WHEN TO COMMENCE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS FOR GROUP INC.  RATING AGENCY GUIDELINES  THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES ASSIGN CREDIT RATINGS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF GROUP INC., WHICH DIRECTLY ISSUES OR GUARANTEES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT OBLIGATIONS. GS&CO. AND GSI HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM ISSUER RATINGS BY CERTAIN CREDIT RATING AGENCIES. GS BANK USA AND GSIB HAVE ALSO BEEN ASSIGNED LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM ISSUER RATINGS, AS WELL AS RATINGS ON THEIR LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM BANK DEPOSITS. IN ADDITION, CREDIT RATING AGENCIES HAVE ASSIGNED RATINGS TO DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF CERTAIN OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF GROUP INC.  THE LEVEL AND COMPOSITION OF OUR EQUITY CAPITAL ARE AMONG THE MANY FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING OUR CREDIT RATINGS. EACH AGENCY HAS ITS OWN DEFINITION OF ELIGIBLE CAPITAL AND METHODOLOGY FOR EVALUATING CAPITAL ADEQUACY, AND ASSESSMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON A COMBINATION OF FACTORS RATHER THAN A SINGLE CALCULATION.

THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPITAL FRAMEWORK INCLUDE THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL BUFFERS AND  G-SIB  SURCHARGE. THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL BUFFERS, APPLICABLE TO US FOR 2019, INCLUDE THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER OF 2.5% AND THE COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER, WHICH THE FRB HAS SET TO ZERO PERCENT. IN ADDITION, THE  G-SIB  SURCHARGE APPLICABLE TO US AS OF JANUARY 2019 IS 2.5% BASED ON 2017 FINANCIAL DATA. BASED ON FINANCIAL DATA FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019, OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE IS THAT WE ARE ABOVE THE THRESHOLD FOR THE 3.0%  G-SIB  SURCHARGE. THE EARLIEST THIS SURCHARGE COULD BE REFLECTED IN OUR RATIO REQUIREMENTS IS JANUARY 2022. THE  G-SIB  SURCHARGE AND COUNTERCYCLICAL BUFFER IN THE FUTURE MAY DIFFER DUE TO ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FROM OUR REGULATORS AND/OR POSITIONAL CHANGES.

AND THE U.K. HAVE AGREED TO A WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT (THE WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT) WHICH REQUIRES RATIFICATION BY BOTH THE U.K. AND THE E.U. PARLIAMENTS. THE U.K. PARLIAMENT HAS NOT YET APPROVED THE WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT. IN OCTOBER 2019, THE U.K. GOVERNMENT REQUESTED A FURTHER EXTENSION TO THE NEGOTIATING PERIOD. THE E.U. HAS AGREED TO AN EXTENSION UNTIL JANUARY 31, 2020 TO ALLOW THE U.K. PARLIAMENT TIME TO EITHER RATIFY THE WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT OR TO HOLD OTHER DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES, SUCH AS A GENERAL ELECTION. ON OCTOBER 29, 2019, THE U.K. PARLIAMENT AGREED TO HOLD A GENERAL ELECTION ON DECEMBER 12, 2019. IF THE WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT IS RATIFIED AHEAD OF JANUARY 31, 2020, THE TERMS OF THE EXTENSION WILL ALLOW THE U.K. TO LEAVE THE E.U. AT AN EARLIER DATE. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS, WITHOUT A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION TO THE PROCESS BY JANUARY 31, 2020, THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE U.K. WILL LEAVE THE E.U. WITHOUT A CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE E.U. OR ANY TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE, IN WHICH CASE FIRMS BASED IN THE U.K. WILL LOSE THEIR EXISTING ACCESS ARRANGEMENTS TO THE E.U.

OVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT  OVERVIEW  WE BELIEVE THAT EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT IS CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK THAT EMPLOYS A COMPREHENSIVE, INTEGRATED APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT, AND IS DESIGNED TO ENABLE COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES THROUGH WHICH WE IDENTIFY, ASSESS, MONITOR AND MANAGE THE RISKS WE ASSUME IN CONDUCTING OUR ACTIVITIES. THESE RISKS INCLUDE LIQUIDITY, MARKET, CREDIT, OPERATIONAL, MODEL, LEGAL, COMPLIANCE, CONDUCT, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISK EXPOSURES. OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE IS BUILT AROUND THREE CORE COMPONENTS: GOVERNANCE, PROCESSES AND PEOPLE.  GOVERNANCE.  RISK MANAGEMENT GOVERNANCE STARTS WITH THE BOARD, WHICH BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH ITS COMMITTEES, INCLUDING ITS RISK COMMITTEE, OVERSEES OUR RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK. THE BOARD IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ANNUAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF OUR RISK APPETITE STATEMENT. THE RISK APPETITE STATEMENT DESCRIBES THE LEVELS AND TYPES OF RISK WE ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT OR TO AVOID, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE OUR STRATEGIC BUSINESS OBJECTIVES, WHILE REMAINING IN COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.  THE BOARD RECEIVES REGULAR BRIEFINGS ON FIRMWIDE RISKS, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, MARKET RISK, CREDIT RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK AND MODEL RISK FROM OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER, AND ON COMPLIANCE RISK AND CONDUCT RISK FROM THE HEAD OF COMPLIANCE, ON LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS FROM THE GENERAL COUNSEL, AND ON OTHER MATTERS IMPACTING OUR REPUTATION FROM THE CHAIR OF OUR FIRMWIDE CLIENT AND BUSINESS STANDARDS COMMITTEE AND OUR FIRMWIDE REPUTATIONAL RISK COMMITTEE.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND CORE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES ARE OVERSEEN BY ENTERPRISE RISK, WHICH REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF RISK OFFICER, AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT OUR ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK PROVIDES THE BOARD, OUR RISK COMMITTEES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT WITH A CONSISTENT AND INTEGRATED APPROACH TO MANAGING OUR VARIOUS RISKS IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH OUR RISK APPETITE.  OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, AS WELL AS TREASURY, OPERATIONS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY, ARE CONSIDERED OUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE. THEY ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE OUTCOMES OF OUR RISK-GENERATING ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS FOR ASSESSING AND MANAGING THOSE RISKS WITHIN OUR RISK APPETITE.  OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS ARE CONSIDERED OUR SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE AND PROVIDE INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT, OVERSIGHT AND CHALLENGE OF THE RISKS TAKEN BY OUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE, AS WELL AS LEAD AND PARTICIPATE IN RISK COMMITTEES. INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS INCLUDE COMPLIANCE, CONFLICTS RESOLUTION, CONTROLLERS, CREDIT RISK, ENTERPRISE RISK, LEGAL, LIQUIDITY RISK, MARKET RISK, MODEL RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK AND TAX.  INTERNAL AUDIT IS CONSIDERED OUR THIRD LINE OF DEFENSE AND REPORTS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD AND ADMINISTRATIVELY TO OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. INTERNAL AUDIT INCLUDES PROFESSIONALS WITH A BROAD RANGE OF AUDIT AND INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING RISK MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE. INTERNAL AUDIT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSING AND VALIDATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF KEY CONTROLS, INCLUDING THOSE WITHIN THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, AND PROVIDING TIMELY REPORTING TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORS.  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  118  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  THE THREE LINES OF DEFENSE STRUCTURE PROMOTES THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF FIRST LINE RISK TAKERS, PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR EFFECTIVE CHALLENGE BY THE SECOND LINE AND EMPOWERS INDEPENDENT REVIEW FROM THE THIRD LINE. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE OTHER FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, THAT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR CONTROL ENVIRONMENT.  OUR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE PROVIDES THE PROTOCOL AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR  DECISION-MAKING  ON RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUES AND ENSURES IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE DECISIONS. WE MAKE EXTENSIVE USE OF RISK COMMITTEES THAT MEET REGULARLY AND SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT MEANS TO FACILITATE AND FOSTER ONGOING DISCUSSIONS TO MANAGE AND MITIGATE RISKS.  WE MAINTAIN STRONG AND PROACTIVE COMMUNICATION ABOUT RISK AND WE HAVE A CULTURE OF COLLABORATION IN DECISION-MAKING AMONG OUR FIRST AND SECOND LINES OF DEFENSE, COMMITTEES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. WHILE OUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGEMENT OF THEIR RISK, WE DEDICATE EXTENSIVE RESOURCES TO OUR SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE IN ORDER TO ENSURE A STRONG OVERSIGHT STRUCTURE AND AN APPROPRIATE SEGREGATION OF DUTIES. WE REGULARLY REINFORCE OUR STRONG CULTURE OF ESCALATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS ALL FUNCTIONS.  PROCESSES.  WE MAINTAIN VARIOUS PROCESSES THAT ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING, ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING OUR RISKS.  TO EFFECTIVELY ASSESS AND MONITOR OUR RISKS, WE MAINTAIN A DAILY DISCIPLINE OF MARKING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVENTORY TO CURRENT MARKET LEVELS. WE CARRY OUR INVENTORY AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN VALUATION REFLECTED IMMEDIATELY IN OUR RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND IN NET REVENUES. WE DO SO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THIS DISCIPLINE IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR ASSESSING AND MANAGING RISK AND THAT IT PROVIDES TRANSPARENT AND REALISTIC INSIGHT INTO OUR INVENTORY EXPOSURES.  AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS IS FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTING. IT ALLOWS US TO QUANTIFY OUR EXPOSURE TO TAIL RISKS, HIGHLIGHT POTENTIAL LOSS CONCENTRATIONS, UNDERTAKE RISK/REWARD ANALYSIS, AND ASSESS AND MITIGATE OUR RISK POSITIONS. FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS ARE PERFORMED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF OUR VULNERABILITIES AND IDIOSYNCRATIC RISKS COMBINING FINANCIAL AND NONFINANCIAL RISKS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CREDIT, MARKET, LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING, OPERATIONAL AND COMPLIANCE, STRATEGIC, SYSTEMIC AND EMERGING RISKS INTO A SINGLE COMBINED SCENARIO. WE ALSO PERFORM AD HOC STRESS TESTS IN ANTICIPATION OF MARKET EVENTS OR CONDITIONS. STRESS TESTS ARE ALSO USED TO ASSESS CAPITAL ADEQUACY AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND STRESS TESTING PROCESS. SEE \u201cEQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND REGULATORY CAPITAL \u2014 EQUITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  WE ALSO APPLY A RIGOROUS FRAMEWORK OF LIMITS AND THRESHOLDS TO CONTROL AND MONITOR RISK ACROSS TRANSACTIONS, PRODUCTS, BUSINESSES AND MARKETS. THE BOARD, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH ITS RISK COMMITTEE, APPROVES LIMITS AND THRESHOLDS INCLUDED IN OUR RISK APPETITE STATEMENT AT FIRMWIDE, BUSINESS AND PRODUCT LEVELS. IN ADDITION, THE FIRMWIDE ENTERPRISE RISK COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROVING OUR RISK LIMITS FRAMEWORK, SUBJECT TO THE OVERALL LIMITS APPROVED BY THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD, AND MONITORING THESE LIMITS ON A DAILY BASIS.  THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR APPROVING LIMITS AT FIRMWIDE, BUSINESS AND PRODUCT LEVELS. CERTAIN LIMITS MAY BE SET AT LEVELS THAT WILL REQUIRE PERIODIC ADJUSTMENT, RATHER THAN AT LEVELS THAT REFLECT OUR MAXIMUM RISK APPETITE. THIS FOSTERS AN ONGOING DIALOGUE ABOUT RISK AMONG OUR FIRST AND SECOND LINES OF DEFENSE, COMMITTEES AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS RAPID ESCALATION OF  RISK-RELATED  MATTERS. ADDITIONALLY, THROUGH DELEGATED AUTHORITY FROM THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE, MARKET RISK SETS LIMITS AT CERTAIN PRODUCT AND DESK LEVELS, AND CREDIT RISK SETS LIMITS FOR INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES, COUNTERPARTIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES, INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES. LIMITS ARE REVIEWED REGULARLY AND AMENDED ON A PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY BASIS TO REFLECT CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS, BUSINESS CONDITIONS OR RISK TOLERANCE.  ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF OUR POSITIONS IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT PROCESS. PROACTIVE MITIGATION OF OUR MARKET AND CREDIT EXPOSURES MINIMIZES THE RISK THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO TAKE OUTSIZED ACTIONS DURING PERIODS OF STRESS.  EFFECTIVE RISK REPORTING AND RISK DECISION-MAKING DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO GET THE RIGHT INFORMATION TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE AT THE RIGHT TIME. AS SUCH, WE FOCUS ON THE RIGOR AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR RISK SYSTEMS, WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ENSURING THAT OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS ARE COMPREHENSIVE, RELIABLE AND TIMELY. WE DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT TIME AND RESOURCES TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY TO ENSURE THAT IT CONSISTENTLY PROVIDES US WITH COMPLETE, ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION.  119  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  PEOPLE  . EVEN THE BEST TECHNOLOGY SERVES ONLY AS A TOOL FOR HELPING TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS IN REAL TIME ABOUT THE RISKS WE ARE TAKING. ULTIMATELY, EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIRES OUR PEOPLE TO INTERPRET OUR RISK DATA ON AN ONGOING AND TIMELY BASIS AND ADJUST RISK POSITIONS ACCORDINGLY. THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR PROFESSIONALS, AND THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NUANCES AND LIMITATIONS OF EACH RISK MEASURE, GUIDES US IN ASSESSING EXPOSURES AND MAINTAINING THEM WITHIN PRUDENT LEVELS.  WE REINFORCE A CULTURE OF EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT, CONSISTENT WITH OUR RISK APPETITE, IN OUR TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS IN THE WAY WE EVALUATE PERFORMANCE, AND RECOGNIZE AND REWARD OUR PEOPLE. OUR TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, INCLUDING CERTAIN SESSIONS LED BY OUR MOST SENIOR LEADERS, ARE FOCUSED ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RISK MANAGEMENT, CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND REPUTATIONAL EXCELLENCE. AS PART OF OUR ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW PROCESS, WE ASSESS REPUTATIONAL EXCELLENCE, INCLUDING HOW AN EMPLOYEE EXERCISES GOOD RISK MANAGEMENT AND REPUTATIONAL JUDGMENT, AND ADHERES TO OUR CODE OF CONDUCT AND COMPLIANCE POLICIES. OUR REVIEW AND REWARD PROCESSES ARE DESIGNED TO COMMUNICATE AND REINFORCE TO OUR PROFESSIONALS THE LINK BETWEEN BEHAVIOR AND HOW PEOPLE ARE RECOGNIZED, THE NEED TO FOCUS ON OUR CLIENTS AND OUR REPUTATION, AND THE NEED TO ALWAYS ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR HIGHEST STANDARDS.  STRUCTURE  ULTIMATE OVERSIGHT OF RISK IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR BOARD. THE BOARD OVERSEES RISK BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH ITS COMMITTEES, INCLUDING ITS RISK COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A SERIES OF COMMITTEES WITH SPECIFIC RISK MANAGEMENT MANDATES THAT HAVE OVERSIGHT OR DECISION-MAKING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP GENERALLY CONSISTS OF SENIOR MANAGERS FROM BOTH OUR FIRST AND SECOND LINES OF DEFENSE. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES FOR THESE COMMITTEES TO ENSURE THAT APPROPRIATE INFORMATION BARRIERS ARE IN PLACE. OUR PRIMARY RISK COMMITTEES, MOST OF WHICH ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL  SUB-COMMITTEES  OR WORKING GROUPS, ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. IN ADDITION TO THESE COMMITTEES, WE HAVE OTHER RISK COMMITTEES THAT PROVIDE OVERSIGHT FOR DIFFERENT BUSINESSES, ACTIVITIES, PRODUCTS, REGIONS AND ENTITIES. ALL OF OUR COMMITTEES HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONSIDERING THE IMPACT OF TRANSACTIONS AND ACTIVITIES, WHICH THEY OVERSEE, ON OUR REPUTATION.  MEMBERSHIP OF OUR RISK COMMITTEES IS REVIEWED REGULARLY AND UPDATED TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT MEMBERS SERVE ON THE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES VARIES AS DETERMINED BY THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND BASED ON THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MEMBERS.

GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  122  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  OVERVIEW  LIQUIDITY RISK IS THE RISK THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO FUND OURSELVES OR MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN THE EVENT OF FIRM-SPECIFIC, BROADER INDUSTRY OR MARKET LIQUIDITY STRESS EVENTS. WE HAVE IN PLACE A COMPREHENSIVE AND CONSERVATIVE SET OF LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING POLICIES. OUR PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE IS TO BE ABLE TO FUND OURSELVES AND TO ENABLE OUR CORE BUSINESSES TO CONTINUE TO SERVE CLIENTS AND GENERATE REVENUES, EVEN UNDER ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES.  TREASURY, WHICH REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEVELOPING, MANAGING AND EXECUTING OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING STRATEGY WITHIN OUR RISK APPETITE.  LIQUIDITY RISK, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND TREASURY, AND REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF RISK OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING OUR LIQUIDITY RISK THROUGH FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT ACROSS OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF STRESS TESTING AND LIMITS FRAMEWORKS.  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES  WE MANAGE LIQUIDITY RISK ACCORDING TO THREE PRINCIPLES: (I) HOLD SUFFICIENT EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN THE FORM OF GCLA TO COVER OUTFLOWS DURING A STRESSED PERIOD, (II) MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT AND (III) MAINTAIN A VIABLE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN.  GCLA.  GCLA IS LIQUIDITY THAT WE MAINTAIN TO MEET A BROAD RANGE OF POTENTIAL CASH OUTFLOWS AND COLLATERAL NEEDS IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. A PRIMARY LIQUIDITY PRINCIPLE IS TO  PRE-FUND  OUR ESTIMATED POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL NEEDS DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND HOLD THIS LIQUIDITY IN THE FORM OF UNENCUMBERED, HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES AND CASH. WE BELIEVE THAT THE SECURITIES HELD IN OUR GCLA WOULD BE READILY CONVERTIBLE TO CASH IN A MATTER OF DAYS, THROUGH LIQUIDATION, BY ENTERING INTO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OR FROM MATURITIES OF RESALE AGREEMENTS, AND THAT THIS CASH WOULD ALLOW US TO MEET IMMEDIATE OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT NEEDING TO SELL OTHER ASSETS OR DEPEND ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM CREDIT-SENSITIVE MARKETS.  OUR GCLA REFLECTS THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES.  \u2022  THE FIRST DAYS OR WEEKS OF A LIQUIDITY CRISIS ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO A COMPANY\u2019S SURVIVAL;  \u2022  FOCUS MUST BE MAINTAINED ON ALL POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS, NOT JUST DISRUPTIONS TO FINANCING FLOWS. OUR BUSINESSES ARE DIVERSE, AND OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARE DETERMINED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET MOVEMENTS, COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS AND CLIENT COMMITMENTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT;  \u2022  DURING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, CREDIT-SENSITIVE FUNDING, INCLUDING UNSECURED DEBT, CERTAIN DEPOSITS AND SOME TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING AGREEMENTS, MAY BE UNAVAILABLE, AND THE TERMS (E.G., INTEREST RATES, COLLATERAL PROVISIONS AND TENOR) OR AVAILABILITY OF OTHER TYPES OF SECURED FINANCING MAY CHANGE AND CERTAIN DEPOSITS MAY BE WITHDRAWN; AND  \u2022  AS A RESULT OF OUR POLICY TO  PRE-FUND  LIQUIDITY THAT WE ESTIMATE MAY BE NEEDED IN A CRISIS, WE HOLD MORE UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES AND HAVE LARGER DEBT BALANCES THAN OUR BUSINESSES WOULD OTHERWISE REQUIRE. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR LIQUIDITY IS STRONGER WITH GREATER BALANCES OF HIGHLY LIQUID UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES, EVEN THOUGH IT INCREASES OUR TOTAL ASSETS AND OUR FUNDING COSTS.  WE MAINTAIN OUR GCLA ACROSS GROUP INC., GOLDMAN SACHS FUNDING LLC (FUNDING IHC) AND GROUP INC.\u2019S MAJOR BROKER-DEALER AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES, ASSET TYPES AND CLEARING AGENTS TO PROVIDE US WITH SUFFICIENT OPERATING LIQUIDITY TO ENSURE TIMELY SETTLEMENT IN ALL MAJOR MARKETS, EVEN IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION TO THE GCLA, WE MAINTAIN CASH BALANCES AND SECURITIES IN SEVERAL OF OUR OTHER ENTITIES, PRIMARILY FOR USE IN SPECIFIC CURRENCIES, ENTITIES OR JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR GCLA PROVIDES US WITH A RESILIENT SOURCE OF FUNDS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN ADVANCE OF POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS AND GIVES US SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN MANAGING THROUGH A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT.  ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT.  OUR LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE WE HAVE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF FINANCING, EVEN WHEN FUNDING MARKETS EXPERIENCE PERSISTENT STRESS. WE MANAGE THE MATURITIES AND DIVERSITY OF OUR FUNDING ACROSS MARKETS, PRODUCTS AND COUNTERPARTIES, AND SEEK TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSIFIED FUNDING PROFILE WITH AN APPROPRIATE TENOR, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CHARACTERISTICS AND LIQUIDITY PROFILE OF OUR ASSETS.  OUR APPROACH TO ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT INCLUDES.  \u2022  CONSERVATIVELY MANAGING THE OVERALL CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR FUNDING BOOK, WITH A FOCUS ON MAINTAINING LONG-TERM, DIVERSIFIED SOURCES OF FUNDING IN EXCESS OF OUR CURRENT REQUIREMENTS. SEE \u201cBALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING SOURCES \u2014 FUNDING SOURCES\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION;  123  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  \u2022  ACTIVELY MANAGING AND MONITORING OUR ASSET BASE, WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE LIQUIDITY, HOLDING PERIOD AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND ASSETS ON A SECURED BASIS. WE ASSESS OUR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND OUR ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE ASSETS IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT WHILE APPROPRIATELY MANAGING RISK. THIS ENABLES US TO DETERMINE THE MOST APPROPRIATE FUNDING PRODUCTS AND TENORS. SEE \u201cBALANCE SHEET AND FUNDING SOURCES \u2014 BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT PROCESS AND \u201c\u2014 FUNDING SOURCES \u2014 SECURED FUNDING\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT ASSET CLASSES THAT MAY BE HARDER TO FUND ON A SECURED BASIS; AND  \u2022  RAISING SECURED AND UNSECURED FINANCING THAT HAS A LONG TENOR RELATIVE TO THE LIQUIDITY PROFILE OF OUR ASSETS. THIS REDUCES THE RISK THAT OUR LIABILITIES WILL COME DUE IN ADVANCE OF OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE LIQUIDITY FROM THE SALE OF OUR ASSETS. BECAUSE WE MAINTAIN A HIGHLY LIQUID BALANCE SHEET, THE HOLDING PERIOD OF CERTAIN OF OUR ASSETS MAY BE MATERIALLY SHORTER THAN THEIR CONTRACTUAL MATURITY DATES.  OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE THAT WE MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO FUND OUR ASSETS AND MEET OUR CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS IN NORMAL TIMES, AS WELL AS DURING PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS. THROUGH OUR DYNAMIC BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT PROCESS, WE USE ACTUAL AND PROJECTED ASSET BALANCES TO DETERMINE SECURED AND UNSECURED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. FUNDING PLANS ARE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE FIRMWIDE ASSET LIABILITY COMMITTEE. IN ADDITION, OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS ANALYZE, AND THE FIRMWIDE ASSET LIABILITY COMMITTEE REVIEWS, OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL CAPITAL POSITION (UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS PLUS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY) SO THAT WE MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF LONG-TERM FUNDING THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM FINANCING REQUIREMENTS. IN A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, WE WOULD FIRST USE OUR GCLA IN ORDER TO AVOID RELIANCE ON ASSET SALES (OTHER THAN OUR GCLA). HOWEVER, WE RECOGNIZE THAT ORDERLY ASSET SALES MAY BE PRUDENT OR NECESSARY IN A SEVERE OR PERSISTENT LIQUIDITY CRISIS.  SUBSIDIARY FUNDING POLICIES  THE MAJORITY OF OUR UNSECURED FUNDING IS RAISED BY GROUP INC., WHICH LENDS THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO FUNDING IHC AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE REGULATED, TO MEET THEIR ASSET FINANCING, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, GROUP INC. PROVIDES ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES WITH THE NECESSARY CAPITAL TO MEET THEIR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH TO SUBSIDIARY FUNDING ARE ENHANCED CONTROL AND GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. FUNDING IS ALSO RAISED AT THE SUBSIDIARY LEVEL THROUGH A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING DEPOSITS, SECURED FUNDING AND UNSECURED BORROWINGS.  OUR INTERCOMPANY FUNDING POLICIES ASSUME THAT A SUBSIDIARY\u2019S FUNDS OR SECURITIES ARE NOT FREELY AVAILABLE TO ITS PARENT, FUNDING IHC OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS (I) LEGALLY PROVIDED FOR AND (II) THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY, TAX OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS. IN PARTICULAR, MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO LAWS THAT AUTHORIZE REGULATORY BODIES TO BLOCK OR REDUCE THE FLOW OF FUNDS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES TO GROUP INC. OR FUNDING IHC. REGULATORY ACTION OF THAT KIND COULD IMPEDE ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT GROUP INC. NEEDS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON ITS OBLIGATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ASSUME THAT THE CAPITAL PROVIDED TO OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES IS NOT AVAILABLE TO GROUP INC. OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND ANY OTHER FINANCING PROVIDED TO OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES IS NOT AVAILABLE TO GROUP INC. OR FUNDING IHC UNTIL THE MATURITY OF SUCH FINANCING.  GROUP INC. HAS PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF EQUITY AND SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO ITS REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES. FOR EXAMPLE, AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, GROUP INC. HAD $31.31 BILLION OF EQUITY AND SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS INVESTED IN GS&CO., ITS PRINCIPAL U.S. REGISTERED BROKER-DEALER; $41.46 BILLION INVESTED IN GSI, A REGULATED U.K. BROKER-DEALER; $2.92 BILLION INVESTED IN GSJCL, A REGULATED JAPANESE BROKER-DEALER; $33.15 BILLION INVESTED IN GS BANK USA, A REGULATED NEW YORK STATE-CHARTERED BANK; AND $4.02 BILLION INVESTED IN GSIB, A REGULATED U.K. BANK. GROUP INC. ALSO PROVIDED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, $104.37 BILLION OF UNSUBORDINATED LOANS (INCLUDING SECURED LOANS OF $19.55 BILLION) AND $14.03 BILLION OF COLLATERAL AND CASH DEPOSITS TO THESE ENTITIES, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH WAS TO GS&CO., GSI AND GSJCL, AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019. IN ADDITION, AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, GROUP INC. HAD SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL INVESTED IN AND LOANS TO ITS OTHER REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.  CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN.  WE MAINTAIN A CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING AND RESPONDING TO A LIQUIDITY CRISIS SITUATION OR PERIODS OF MARKET STRESS. OUR CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN OUTLINES A LIST OF POTENTIAL RISK FACTORS, KEY REPORTS AND METRICS THAT ARE REVIEWED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO ASSIST IN ASSESSING THE SEVERITY OF, AND MANAGING THROUGH, A LIQUIDITY CRISIS AND/OR MARKET DISLOCATION. THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN ALSO DESCRIBES IN DETAIL OUR POTENTIAL RESPONSES IF OUR ASSESSMENTS INDICATE THAT WE HAVE ENTERED A LIQUIDITY CRISIS, WHICH INCLUDE  PRE-FUNDING  FOR WHAT WE ESTIMATE WILL BE OUR POTENTIAL CASH AND COLLATERAL NEEDS, AS WELL AS UTILIZING SECONDARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. MITIGANTS AND ACTION ITEMS TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC RISKS WHICH MAY ARISE ARE ALSO DESCRIBED AND ASSIGNED TO INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXECUTION.  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  124  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN IDENTIFIES KEY GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS TO FOSTER EFFECTIVE COORDINATION, CONTROL AND DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION, ALL OF WHICH ARE CRITICAL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF A CRISIS OR PERIOD OF MARKET STRESS. THE CONTINGENCY FUNDING PLAN ALSO PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THESE GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS, WHICH INCLUDE MAKING AND DISSEMINATING KEY DECISIONS, COORDINATING ALL CONTINGENCY ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE CRISIS OR PERIOD OF MARKET STRESS, IMPLEMENTING LIQUIDITY MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES AND MANAGING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COMMUNICATION.  STRESS TESTS  IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE SIZE OF OUR GCLA, WE USE AN INTERNAL LIQUIDITY MODEL, REFERRED TO AS THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW, WHICH CAPTURES AND QUANTIFIES OUR LIQUIDITY RISKS. WE ALSO CONSIDER OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AN ASSESSMENT OF OUR POTENTIAL INTRADAY LIQUIDITY NEEDS THROUGH AN ADDITIONAL INTERNAL LIQUIDITY MODEL, REFERRED TO AS THE INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL, THE RESULTS OF OUR LONG-TERM STRESS TESTING MODELS, OUR RESOLUTION LIQUIDITY MODELS AND OTHER APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF OUR CONDITION, AS WELL AS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. THE RESULTS OF THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW, THE INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL, THE LONG-TERM STRESS TESTING MODELS AND THE RESOLUTION LIQUIDITY MODELS ARE REPORTED TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT ON A REGULAR BASIS. WE ALSO PERFORM FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS. SEE \u201cOVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR INFORMATION ABOUT FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS.  MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW.  OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW IS BASED ON CONDUCTING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS THAT INCLUDE COMBINATIONS OF MARKET-WIDE AND FIRM-SPECIFIC STRESS. THESE SCENARIOS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE FOLLOWING QUALITATIVE ELEMENTS.  \u2022  SEVERELY CHALLENGED MARKET ENVIRONMENTS, INCLUDING LOW CONSUMER AND CORPORATE CONFIDENCE, FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY, ADVERSE CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES, INCLUDING POTENTIAL DECLINES IN EQUITY MARKETS AND WIDENING OF CREDIT SPREADS; AND  \u2022  A FIRM-SPECIFIC CRISIS POTENTIALLY TRIGGERED BY MATERIAL LOSSES, REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE, LITIGATION, EXECUTIVE DEPARTURE, AND/OR A RATINGS DOWNGRADE.  THE FOLLOWING ARE KEY MODELING ELEMENTS OF OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW.  \u2022  LIQUIDITY NEEDS OVER A  30-DAY  SCENARIO;  \u2022  A  TWO-NOTCH  DOWNGRADE OF OUR LONG-TERM SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT RATINGS;  \u2022  A COMBINATION OF CONTRACTUAL OUTFLOWS, SUCH AS UPCOMING MATURITIES OF UNSECURED DEBT, AND CONTINGENT OUTFLOWS (E.G., ACTIONS, THOUGH NOT CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED, WE MAY DEEM NECESSARY IN A CRISIS). WE ASSUME THAT MOST CONTINGENT OUTFLOWS WILL OCCUR WITHIN THE INITIAL DAYS AND WEEKS OF A CRISIS;  \u2022  NO ISSUANCE OF EQUITY OR UNSECURED DEBT;  \u2022  NO SUPPORT FROM ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING FACILITIES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACCESS TO VARIOUS CENTRAL BANK FUNDING PROGRAMS, WE DO NOT ASSUME RELIANCE ON ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF FUNDING IN A LIQUIDITY CRISIS; AND  \u2022  NO ASSET LIQUIDATION EXCEPT RELATING TO GCLA OR HEDGING ACTIVITIES.  THE POTENTIAL CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT CASH AND COLLATERAL OUTFLOWS COVERED IN OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW INCLUDE.  UNSECURED FUNDING  \u2022  CONTRACTUAL: ALL UPCOMING MATURITIES OF UNSECURED LONG-TERM DEBT, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER UNSECURED FUNDING PRODUCTS. WE ASSUME THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO ISSUE NEW UNSECURED DEBT OR ROLL OVER ANY MATURING DEBT.  \u2022  CONTINGENT: REPURCHASES OF OUR OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AS A MARKET MAKER.  DEPOSITS  \u2022  CONTRACTUAL: ALL UPCOMING MATURITIES OF TERM DEPOSITS. WE ASSUME THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO RAISE NEW TERM DEPOSITS OR ROLL OVER ANY MATURING TERM DEPOSITS.  \u2022  CONTINGENT: PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS OF DEPOSITS THAT HAVE NO CONTRACTUAL MATURITY. THE WITHDRAWAL ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE TYPE OF DEPOSIT, WHETHER THE DEPOSIT IS INSURED OR UNINSURED, AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEPOSITOR.  SECURED FUNDING  \u2022  CONTRACTUAL: A PORTION OF UPCOMING CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES OF SECURED FUNDING DUE TO EITHER THE INABILITY TO REFINANCE OR THE ABILITY TO REFINANCE ONLY AT WIDER HAIRCUTS (I.E., ON TERMS WHICH REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL). OUR ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, COUNTERPARTY ROLL PROBABILITIES (OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE COUNTERPARTY\u2019S LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINUING TO PROVIDE FUNDING ON A SECURED BASIS AT THE MATURITY OF THE TRADE) AND COUNTERPARTY CONCENTRATION.  \u2022  CONTINGENT: ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL FOR FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, WHICH WOULD NECESSITATE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL POSTINGS UNDER THOSE TRANSACTIONS.  125  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OTC DERIVATIVES  \u2022  CONTINGENT: COLLATERAL POSTINGS TO COUNTERPARTIES DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF OUR OTC DERIVATIVES, EXCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE CLEARED AND SETTLED THROUGH CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES  (OTC-CLEARED).  \u2022  CONTINGENT: OTHER OUTFLOWS OF CASH OR COLLATERAL RELATED TO OTC DERIVATIVES, EXCLUDING  OTC-CLEARED,  INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF TRADE TERMINATIONS, COLLATERAL SUBSTITUTIONS, COLLATERAL DISPUTES, LOSS OF REHYPOTHECATION RIGHTS, COLLATERAL CALLS OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS REQUIRED BY A  TWO-NOTCH  DOWNGRADE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, AND COLLATERAL THAT HAS NOT BEEN CALLED BY COUNTERPARTIES, BUT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM.  EXCHANGE-TRADED AND  OTC-CLEARED  DERIVATIVES  \u2022  CONTINGENT: VARIATION MARGIN POSTINGS REQUIRED DUE TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF OUR OUTSTANDING EXCHANGE-TRADED AND  OTC-CLEARED  DERIVATIVES.  \u2022  CONTINGENT: AN INCREASE IN INITIAL MARGIN AND GUARANTY FUND REQUIREMENTS BY DERIVATIVE CLEARING HOUSES.  CUSTOMER CASH AND SECURITIES  \u2022  CONTINGENT: LIQUIDITY OUTFLOWS IN OUR PRIME BROKERAGE BUSINESS, INCLUDING WITHDRAWALS OF CUSTOMER CREDIT BALANCES, AND A REDUCTION IN CUSTOMER SHORT POSITIONS, WHICH MAY SERVE AS A FUNDING SOURCE FOR LONG POSITIONS.  SECURITIES  \u2022  CONTINGENT: LIQUIDITY OUTFLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCTION OR COMPOSITION CHANGE IN OUR SHORT POSITIONS, WHICH MAY SERVE AS A FUNDING SOURCE FOR LONG POSITIONS.  UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS  \u2022  CONTINGENT: DRAWS ON OUR UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS. DRAW ASSUMPTIONS REFLECT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TYPE OF COMMITMENT AND COUNTERPARTY.  OTHER  \u2022  OTHER LARGE CASH OUTFLOWS THAT COULD OCCUR IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT.  INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL.  OUR INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL MEASURES OUR INTRADAY LIQUIDITY NEEDS USING A SCENARIO ANALYSIS CHARACTERIZED BY THE SAME QUALITATIVE ELEMENTS AS OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW. THE MODEL ASSESSES THE RISK OF INCREASED INTRADAY LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS DURING A SCENARIO WHERE ACCESS TO SOURCES OF INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MAY BECOME CONSTRAINED.  THE FOLLOWING ARE KEY MODELING ELEMENTS OF OUR INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL.  \u2022  LIQUIDITY NEEDS OVER A  ONE-DAY  SETTLEMENT PERIOD;  \u2022  DELAYS IN RECEIPT OF COUNTERPARTY CASH PAYMENTS;  \u2022  A REDUCTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF INTRADAY CREDIT LINES AT OUR CLEARING AGENTS AND AGENT BANKS; AND  \u2022  HIGHER SETTLEMENT VOLUMES DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ACTIVITY.  LONG-TERM STRESS TESTING.  WE UTILIZE LONGER-TERM STRESS TESTS TO TAKE A FORWARD VIEW ON OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION THROUGH PROLONGED STRESS PERIODS IN WHICH WE EXPERIENCE A SEVERE LIQUIDITY STRESS AND RECOVER IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT CONTINUES TO BE CHALLENGING. WE ARE FOCUSED ON ENSURING CONSERVATIVE ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT TO PREPARE FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF POTENTIAL STRESS, SEEKING TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSIFIED FUNDING PROFILE WITH AN APPROPRIATE TENOR, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CHARACTERISTICS AND LIQUIDITY PROFILE OF OUR ASSETS.  WE ALSO PERFORM STRESS TESTS ON A REGULAR BASIS AS PART OF OUR ROUTINE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND CONDUCT TAILORED STRESS TESTS ON AN AD HOC OR PRODUCT-SPECIFIC BASIS IN RESPONSE TO MARKET DEVELOPMENTS.  RESOLUTION LIQUIDITY MODELS.  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR RESOLUTION PLANNING EFFORTS, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED OUR RESOLUTION LIQUIDITY ADEQUACY AND POSITIONING FRAMEWORK, WHICH ESTIMATES LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF OUR MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES IN A STRESSED ENVIRONMENT. THE LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARE MEASURED USING OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW ASSUMPTIONS AND INCLUDE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL INTER-AFFILIATE EXPOSURES. WE HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED OUR RESOLUTION LIQUIDITY EXECUTION NEED FRAMEWORK, WHICH MEASURES THE LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF OUR MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES TO STABILIZE AND WIND-DOWN FOLLOWING A GROUP INC. BANKRUPTCY FILING IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR PREFERRED RESOLUTION STRATEGY.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A TRIGGERS AND ALERTS FRAMEWORK, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE BOARD WITH INFORMATION NEEDED TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON WHETHER AND WHEN TO COMMENCE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS FOR GROUP INC.  MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION  WE REGULARLY REFINE OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW, INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL AND OUR OTHER STRESS TESTING MODELS TO REFLECT CHANGES IN MARKET OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OUR BUSINESS MIX. ANY CHANGES, INCLUDING MODEL ASSUMPTIONS, ARE APPROVED BY TREASURY AND LIQUIDITY RISK. ALL EXISTING MODELS ARE REVIEWED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO MODELS AND THEIR ASSUMPTIONS ARE APPROVED BY MODEL RISK PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION. SEE \u201cMODEL RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  LIMITS  WE USE LIQUIDITY RISK LIMITS AT VARIOUS LEVELS AND ACROSS LIQUIDITY RISK TYPES TO MANAGE THE SIZE OF OUR LIQUIDITY EXPOSURES. LIMITS ARE MEASURED RELATIVE TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF RISK GIVEN OUR LIQUIDITY RISK TOLERANCE. SEE \u201cOVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE LIMIT APPROVAL PROCESS.  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  126  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

LIQUIDITY RISK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING AND ESCALATING TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND/OR THE APPROPRIATE RISK COMMITTEE, ON A TIMELY BASIS, INSTANCES WHERE LIMITS HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED.  GCLA AND UNENCUMBERED METRICS  GCLA.  BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR INTERNAL LIQUIDITY RISK MODELS, DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS WELL AS OUR CONSIDERATION OF OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF OUR CONDITION, AS WELL AS THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, WE BELIEVE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AS OF BOTH SEPTEMBER 2019 AND DECEMBER 2018 WAS APPROPRIATE. WE STRICTLY LIMIT OUR GCLA TO A NARROWLY DEFINED LIST OF SECURITIES AND CASH BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLY LIQUID, EVEN IN A DIFFICULT FUNDING ENVIRONMENT. WE DO NOT INCLUDE OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF EXCESS LIQUIDITY IN OUR GCLA, SUCH AS LESS LIQUID UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES OR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES.

WE MAINTAIN OUR GCLA TO ENABLE US TO MEET CURRENT AND POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF OUR PARENT COMPANY, GROUP INC., AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. OUR MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW AND INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL INCORPORATE A CONSOLIDATED REQUIREMENT FOR GROUP INC., AS WELL AS A STANDALONE REQUIREMENT FOR EACH OF OUR MAJOR BROKER-DEALER AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES. FUNDING IHC IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY LIQUIDITY TO GROUP INC. DURING THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, AND IS ALSO OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY SUPPORT TO MAJOR SUBSIDIARIES IN THE EVENT OF OUR MATERIAL FINANCIAL DISTRESS OR FAILURE. LIQUIDITY HELD DIRECTLY IN EACH OF OUR MAJOR BROKER-DEALER AND BANK SUBSIDIARIES IS INTENDED FOR USE ONLY BY THAT SUBSIDIARY TO MEET ITS LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND IS ASSUMED NOT TO BE AVAILABLE TO GROUP INC. OR FUNDING IHC UNLESS (I) LEGALLY PROVIDED FOR AND (II) THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY, TAX OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE MODELED LIQUIDITY OUTFLOW AND INTRADAY LIQUIDITY MODEL ALSO INCORPORATE A BROADER ASSESSMENT OF STANDALONE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND WE HOLD A PORTION OF OUR GCLA DIRECTLY AT GROUP INC. OR FUNDING IHC TO SUPPORT SUCH REQUIREMENTS.  OTHER UNENCUMBERED ASSETS.  IN ADDITION TO OUR GCLA, WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OTHER UNENCUMBERED CASH AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING OTHER GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS, HIGH-GRADE MONEY MARKET SECURITIES, CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS, MARGINABLE EQUITIES, LOANS AND CASH DEPOSITS NOT INCLUDED IN OUR GCLA. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR UNENCUMBERED ASSETS AVERAGED $203.30 BILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019 AND $204.19 BILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2019. WE DO NOT CONSIDER THESE ASSETS LIQUID ENOUGH TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR GCLA.  LIQUIDITY REGULATORY FRAMEWORK  AS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY (BHC), WE ARE SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR) UNDER THE LCR RULE APPROVED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES. THE LCR RULE REQUIRES ORGANIZATIONS TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE RATIO OF ELIGIBLE HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID ASSETS (HQLA) TO EXPECTED NET CASH OUTFLOWS UNDER AN ACUTE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY STRESS SCENARIO. ELIGIBLE HQLA EXCLUDES HQLA HELD BY SUBSIDIARIES THAT IS IN EXCESS OF THEIR MINIMUM REQUIREMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS. WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM LCR OF 100%. WE EXPECT THAT FLUCTUATIONS IN CLIENT ACTIVITY, BUSINESS MIX AND THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT WILL IMPACT OUR AVERAGE LCR.  127  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

THE PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TO ENSURE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO STABLE FUNDING OVER A  ONE-YEAR  TIME HORIZON. THE PROPOSED RULE INCLUDES QUARTERLY DISCLOSURE OF THE RATIO AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE BANKING ORGANIZATION\u2019S STABLE FUNDING SOURCES. THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES HAVE NOT RELEASED THE FINAL RULE. WE EXPECT THAT WE WILL BE COMPLIANT WITH THE NSFR REQUIREMENT WHEN IT IS EFFECTIVE.  THE FOLLOWING IS INFORMATION ABOUT OUR SUBSIDIARY LIQUIDITY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.  \u2022  GS BANK USA.  GS BANK USA IS SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM LCR OF 100% UNDER THE LCR RULE APPROVED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, GS BANK USA\u2019S LCR EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT. THE NSFR REQUIREMENT DESCRIBED ABOVE WOULD ALSO APPLY TO GS BANK USA.  \u2022  GSI.  GSI IS SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM LCR OF 100% UNDER THE LCR RULE APPROVED BY THE U.K. REGULATORY AUTHORITIES AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. GSI\u2019S AVERAGE MONTHLY LCR FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019 EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT.  \u2022  OTHER SUBSIDIARIES.  WE MONITOR LOCAL REGULATORY LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. FOR MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, THESE REQUIREMENTS EITHER HAVE CHANGED OR ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BASEL COMMITTEE ON BANKING SUPERVISION\u2019S FRAMEWORK FOR LIQUIDITY RISK MEASUREMENT, STANDARDS AND MONITORING, AS WELL AS OTHER REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS.  THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RULES AND ANY AMENDMENTS ADOPTED BY THE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, COULD IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING REQUIREMENTS AND PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE.  CREDIT RATINGS  WE RELY ON THE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS TO FUND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR  DAY-TO-DAY  OPERATIONS AND THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF DEBT FINANCING IS INFLUENCED BY OUR CREDIT RATINGS. CREDIT RATINGS ARE ALSO IMPORTANT WHEN WE ARE COMPETING IN CERTAIN MARKETS, SUCH AS OTC DERIVATIVES, AND WHEN WE SEEK TO ENGAGE IN LONGER-TERM TRANSACTIONS.

CERTAIN OF OUR DERIVATIVES HAVE BEEN TRANSACTED UNDER BILATERAL AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES WHO MAY REQUIRE US TO POST COLLATERAL OR TERMINATE THE TRANSACTIONS BASED ON CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS. WE MANAGE OUR GCLA TO ENSURE WE WOULD, AMONG OTHER POTENTIAL REQUIREMENTS, BE ABLE TO MAKE THE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED IN THE EVENT OF A  TWO-NOTCH  REDUCTION IN OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS, AS WELL AS COLLATERAL THAT HAS NOT BEEN CALLED BY COUNTERPARTIES, BUT IS AVAILABLE TO THEM.  SEE NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT DERIVATIVES WITH CREDIT-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES AND THE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL OR TERMINATION PAYMENTS RELATED TO OUR NET DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES UNDER BILATERAL AGREEMENTS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CALLED BY COUNTERPARTIES IN THE EVENT OF A ONE- OR TWO-NOTCH DOWNGRADE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS.  CASH FLOWS  AS A GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, OUR CASH FLOWS ARE COMPLEX AND BEAR LITTLE RELATION TO OUR NET EARNINGS AND NET ASSETS. CONSEQUENTLY, WE BELIEVE THAT TRADITIONAL CASH FLOW ANALYSIS IS LESS MEANINGFUL IN EVALUATING OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION THAN THE LIQUIDITY AND ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POLICIES DESCRIBED ABOVE. CASH FLOW ANALYSIS MAY, HOWEVER, BE HELPFUL IN HIGHLIGHTING CERTAIN MACRO TRENDS AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES IN OUR BUSINESSES.  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019.  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED BY $36.45 BILLION TO $94.09 BILLION AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET CASH USED FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES. THE NET CASH USED FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN COLLATERALIZED FINANCINGS INCLUDED IN COLLATERALIZED TRANSACTIONS. THESE CHANGES PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER CLIENT ACTIVITY. THE NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY OBLIGATIONS ACCOUNTED FOR AS  AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE  SECURITIES. THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED INCREASES IN CONSUMER DEPOSITS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET REPAYMENTS OF UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2018.  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED BY $8.82 BILLION TO $118.87 BILLION AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES. THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED INCREASES IN BROKERED CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND MARCUS DEPOSITS, AND NET ISSUANCES OF UNSECURED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS. THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED A DECREASE IN COLLATERALIZED TRANSACTIONS AND AN INCREASE IN PAYABLES TO CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OWNED. THE NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY TO FUND LOANS RECEIVABLE TO CORPORATE BORROWERS AND LOANS BACKED BY COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE.  129  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  OVERVIEW  MARKET RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS IN THE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, DUE TO CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS. WE EMPLOY A VARIETY OF RISK MEASURES, EACH DESCRIBED IN THE RESPECTIVE SECTIONS BELOW, TO MONITOR MARKET RISK. WE HOLD INVENTORY PRIMARILY FOR MARKET MAKING FOR OUR CLIENTS AND FOR OUR INVESTING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. OUR INVENTORY, THEREFORE, CHANGES BASED ON CLIENT DEMANDS AND OUR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. OUR INVENTORY IS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE AND THEREFORE FLUCTUATES ON A DAILY BASIS, WITH THE RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN MARKET MAKING AND OTHER PRINCIPAL TRANSACTIONS. CATEGORIES OF MARKET RISK INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  INTEREST RATE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN THE LEVEL, SLOPE AND CURVATURE OF YIELD CURVES, THE VOLATILITIES OF INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS AND CREDIT SPREADS;  \u2022  EQUITY PRICE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF INDIVIDUAL EQUITIES, BASKETS OF EQUITIES AND EQUITY INDICES;  \u2022  CURRENCY RATE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF CURRENCY RATES; AND  \u2022  COMMODITY PRICE RISK: RESULTS FROM EXPOSURES TO CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES, FORWARD PRICES AND VOLATILITIES OF COMMODITIES, SUCH AS CRUDE OIL, PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, NATURAL GAS, ELECTRICITY, AND PRECIOUS AND BASE METALS.  MARKET RISK, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF RISK OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING OUR MARKET RISK THROUGH FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT ACROSS OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES.  MANAGERS IN REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND MARKET RISK DISCUSS MARKET INFORMATION, POSITIONS AND ESTIMATED LOSS SCENARIOS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. MANAGERS IN REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANAGING RISK WITHIN PRESCRIBED LIMITS. THESE MANAGERS HAVE  IN-DEPTH  KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR POSITIONS, MARKETS AND THE INSTRUMENTS AVAILABLE TO HEDGE THEIR EXPOSURES.  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS  OUR PROCESS FOR MANAGING MARKET RISK INCLUDES.  \u2022  COLLECTING COMPLETE, ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION;  \u2022  UTILIZING A DYNAMIC LIMIT-SETTING FRAMEWORK;  \u2022  MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH ESTABLISHED MARKET RISK LIMITS AND REPORTING OUR EXPOSURES;  \u2022  DIVERSIFYING EXPOSURES;  \u2022  CONTROLLING POSITION SIZES;  \u2022  EVALUATING MITIGANTS, SUCH AS ECONOMIC HEDGES IN RELATED SECURITIES OR DERIVATIVES; AND  \u2022  ENSURING PROACTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS.  OUR MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ENABLE US TO PERFORM AN INDEPENDENT CALCULATION OF VAR AND STRESS MEASURES, CAPTURE RISK MEASURES AT INDIVIDUAL POSITION LEVELS, ATTRIBUTE RISK MEASURES TO INDIVIDUAL RISK FACTORS OF EACH POSITION, REPORT MANY DIFFERENT VIEWS OF THE RISK MEASURES (E.G., BY DESK, BUSINESS, PRODUCT TYPE OR ENTITY) AND PRODUCE AD HOC ANALYSES IN A TIMELY MANNER.  RISK MEASURES  WE PRODUCE RISK MEASURES AND MONITOR THEM AGAINST ESTABLISHED MARKET RISK LIMITS. THESE MEASURES REFLECT AN EXTENSIVE RANGE OF SCENARIOS AND THE RESULTS ARE AGGREGATED AT PRODUCT, BUSINESS AND FIRMWIDE LEVELS.  WE USE A VARIETY OF RISK MEASURES TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF POTENTIAL LOSSES FOR BOTH MODERATE AND MORE EXTREME MARKET MOVES OVER BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM TIME HORIZONS. OUR PRIMARY RISK MEASURES ARE VAR, WHICH IS USED FOR SHORTER-TERM PERIODS, AND STRESS TESTS. OUR RISK REPORTS DETAIL KEY RISKS, DRIVERS AND CHANGES FOR EACH DESK AND BUSINESS, AND ARE DISTRIBUTED DAILY TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF BOTH OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS.  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  130  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  VALUE-AT-RISK.  VAR IS THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN VALUE DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON WITH A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL. FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDED IN VAR, SEE \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENT LINKAGES TO MARKET RISK MEASURES.\u201d WE TYPICALLY EMPLOY A  ONE-DAY  TIME HORIZON WITH A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. WE USE A SINGLE VAR MODEL, WHICH CAPTURES RISKS INCLUDING INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES, CURRENCY RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. AS SUCH, VAR FACILITATES COMPARISON ACROSS PORTFOLIOS OF DIFFERENT RISK CHARACTERISTICS. VAR ALSO CAPTURES THE DIVERSIFICATION OF AGGREGATED RISK AT THE FIRMWIDE LEVEL.  WE ARE AWARE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO VAR AND THEREFORE USE A VARIETY OF RISK MEASURES IN OUR MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. INHERENT LIMITATIONS TO VAR INCLUDE.  \u2022  VAR DOES NOT ESTIMATE POTENTIAL LOSSES OVER LONGER TIME HORIZONS WHERE MOVES MAY BE EXTREME;  \u2022  VAR DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE RELATIVE LIQUIDITY OF DIFFERENT RISK POSITIONS; AND  \u2022  PREVIOUS MOVES IN MARKET RISK FACTORS MAY NOT PRODUCE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF ALL FUTURE MARKET MOVES.  TO COMPREHENSIVELY CAPTURE OUR EXPOSURES AND RELEVANT RISKS IN OUR VAR CALCULATION, WE USE HISTORICAL SIMULATIONS WITH FULL VALUATION OF MARKET FACTORS AT THE POSITION LEVEL BY SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOCKING THE RELEVANT MARKET FACTORS FOR THAT POSITION. THESE MARKET FACTORS INCLUDE SPOT PRICES, CREDIT SPREADS, FUNDING SPREADS, YIELD CURVES, VOLATILITY AND CORRELATION, AND ARE UPDATED PERIODICALLY BASED ON CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF POSITIONS, AS WELL AS VARIATIONS IN MARKET CONDITIONS. WE SAMPLE FROM FIVE YEARS OF HISTORICAL DATA TO GENERATE THE SCENARIOS FOR OUR VAR CALCULATION. THE HISTORICAL DATA IS WEIGHTED SO THAT THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE DATA REDUCES OVER TIME. THIS GIVES GREATER IMPORTANCE TO MORE RECENT OBSERVATIONS AND REFLECTS CURRENT ASSET VOLATILITIES, WHICH IMPROVES THE ACCURACY OF OUR ESTIMATES OF POTENTIAL LOSS. AS A RESULT, EVEN IF OUR POSITIONS INCLUDED IN VAR WERE UNCHANGED, OUR VAR WOULD INCREASE WITH INCREASING MARKET VOLATILITY AND VICE VERSA.  GIVEN ITS RELIANCE ON HISTORICAL DATA, VAR IS MOST EFFECTIVE IN ESTIMATING RISK EXPOSURES IN MARKETS IN WHICH THERE ARE NO SUDDEN FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES OR SHIFTS IN MARKET CONDITIONS.  OUR VAR MEASURE DOES NOT INCLUDE.  \u2022  POSITIONS THAT ARE BEST MEASURED AND MONITORED USING SENSITIVITY MEASURES; AND  \u2022  THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN COUNTERPARTY AND OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON DERIVATIVES, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON FINANCIAL LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED.  WE PERFORM DAILY BACKTESTING OF OUR VAR MODEL (I.E., COMPARING DAILY NET REVENUES FOR POSITIONS INCLUDED IN VAR TO THE VAR MEASURE CALCULATED AS OF THE PRIOR BUSINESS DAY) AT THE FIRMWIDE LEVEL AND FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES AND MAJOR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.  STRESS TESTING.  STRESS TESTING IS A METHOD OF DETERMINING THE EFFECT OF VARIOUS HYPOTHETICAL STRESS SCENARIOS. WE USE STRESS TESTING TO EXAMINE RISKS OF SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF OUR SIGNIFICANT RISK EXPOSURES. WE USE A VARIETY OF STRESS TESTING TECHNIQUES TO CALCULATE THE POTENTIAL LOSS FROM A WIDE RANGE OF MARKET MOVES ON OUR PORTFOLIOS, INCLUDING FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND SCENARIO ANALYSIS. THE RESULTS OF OUR VARIOUS STRESS TESTS ARE ANALYZED TOGETHER FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. SEE \u201cOVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR INFORMATION ABOUT FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS.  SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS USED TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF A MARKET MOVE IN A SINGLE RISK FACTOR ACROSS ALL POSITIONS (E.G., EQUITY PRICES OR CREDIT SPREADS) USING A VARIETY OF DEFINED MARKET SHOCKS, RANGING FROM THOSE THAT COULD BE EXPECTED OVER A  ONE-DAY  TIME HORIZON UP TO THOSE THAT COULD TAKE MANY MONTHS TO OCCUR. WE ALSO USE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF THE DEFAULT OF ANY SINGLE ENTITY, WHICH CAPTURES THE RISK OF LARGE OR CONCENTRATED EXPOSURES.  SCENARIO ANALYSIS IS USED TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF A SPECIFIED EVENT, INCLUDING HOW THE EVENT IMPACTS MULTIPLE RISK FACTORS SIMULTANEOUSLY. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR SOVEREIGN STRESS TESTING WE CALCULATE POTENTIAL DIRECT EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SOVEREIGN INVENTORY, AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING DEBT, EQUITY AND CURRENCY EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR  NON-SOVEREIGN  INVENTORY THAT MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE SOVEREIGN DISTRESS. WHEN CONDUCTING SCENARIO ANALYSIS, WE TYPICALLY CONSIDER A NUMBER OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES FOR EACH SCENARIO, RANGING FROM MODERATE TO SEVERELY ADVERSE MARKET IMPACTS. IN ADDITION, THESE STRESS TESTS ARE CONSTRUCTED USING BOTH HISTORICAL EVENTS AND FORWARD-LOOKING HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIOS.  UNLIKE VAR MEASURES, WHICH HAVE AN IMPLIED PROBABILITY BECAUSE THEY ARE CALCULATED AT A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL, THERE IS GENERALLY NO IMPLIED PROBABILITY THAT OUR STRESS TESTING SCENARIOS WILL OCCUR. INSTEAD, STRESS TESTING IS USED TO MODEL BOTH MODERATE AND MORE EXTREME MOVES IN UNDERLYING MARKET FACTORS. WHEN ESTIMATING POTENTIAL LOSS, WE GENERALLY ASSUME THAT OUR POSITIONS CANNOT BE REDUCED OR HEDGED (ALTHOUGH EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT WE ARE GENERALLY ABLE TO DO SO).  131  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  LIMITS  WE USE MARKET RISK LIMITS AT VARIOUS LEVELS TO MANAGE THE SIZE OF OUR MARKET EXPOSURES. THESE LIMITS ARE SET BASED ON VAR AND ON A RANGE OF STRESS TESTS RELEVANT TO OUR EXPOSURES. SEE \u201cOVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE LIMIT APPROVAL PROCESS.  MARKET RISK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THESE LIMITS, AND IDENTIFYING AND ESCALATING TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND/OR THE APPROPRIATE RISK COMMITTEE, ON A TIMELY BASIS, INSTANCES WHERE LIMITS HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED (E.G., DUE TO POSITIONAL CHANGES OR CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, SUCH AS INCREASED VOLATILITIES OR CHANGES IN CORRELATIONS). SUCH INSTANCES ARE REMEDIATED BY AN INVENTORY REDUCTION AND/OR A TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT INCREASE TO THE LIMIT.  MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION  OUR VAR AND STRESS TESTING MODELS ARE REGULARLY REVIEWED AND ENHANCED IN ORDER TO INCORPORATE CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF POSITIONS INCLUDED IN OUR MARKET RISK MEASURES, AS WELL AS VARIATIONS IN MARKET CONDITIONS. ALL EXISTING MODELS ARE REVIEWED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO MODELS AND THEIR ASSUMPTIONS ARE APPROVED BY MODEL RISK PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION.

DURING PERIODS IN WHICH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POSITIVE NET REVENUE DAYS THAN NET REVENUE LOSS DAYS, WE EXPECT TO HAVE FEWER VAR EXCEPTIONS BECAUSE, UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS, OUR BUSINESS MODEL GENERALLY PRODUCES POSITIVE NET REVENUES. IN PERIODS IN WHICH OUR FRANCHISE REVENUES ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, WE GENERALLY HAVE MORE LOSS DAYS, RESULTING IN MORE VAR EXCEPTIONS.

VAR EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN COUNTERPARTY AND OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON DERIVATIVES, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS (DEBT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT) ON FINANCIAL LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED. THE ESTIMATED SENSITIVITY TO A ONE BASIS POINT INCREASE IN CREDIT SPREADS (COUNTERPARTY AND OUR OWN) ON DERIVATIVES (INCLUDING HEDGES) WAS A GAIN OF $2 MILLION AS OF BOTH SEPTEMBER 2019 AND JUNE 2019. IN ADDITION, THE ESTIMATED SENSITIVITY TO A ONE BASIS POINT INCREASE IN OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS ON FINANCIAL LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED WAS A GAIN OF $33 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019 AND $38 MILLION AS OF JUNE 2019. HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL NET IMPACT OF A CHANGE IN OUR OWN CREDIT SPREADS IS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE LIQUIDITY, DURATION AND CONVEXITY (AS THE SENSITIVITY IS NOT LINEAR TO CHANGES IN YIELDS) OF THOSE FINANCIAL LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION WAS ELECTED, AS WELL AS THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF ANY HEDGES UNDERTAKEN.

OUR EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK COMES MOSTLY FROM CLIENT TRANSACTIONS IN OTC DERIVATIVES AND LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS. CREDIT RISK ALSO COMES FROM CASH PLACED WITH BANKS, SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS (I.E., RESALE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SECURITIES BORROWING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES) AND CUSTOMER AND OTHER RECEIVABLES.  CREDIT RISK, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF RISK OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING OUR CREDIT RISK THROUGH FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT ACROSS OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES. THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE REVIEWS AND APPROVES CREDIT POLICIES AND PARAMETERS. IN ADDITION, WE HOLD OTHER POSITIONS THAT GIVE RISE TO CREDIT RISK (E.G., BONDS HELD IN OUR INVENTORY AND SECONDARY BANK LOANS). THESE CREDIT RISKS ARE CAPTURED AS A COMPONENT OF MARKET RISK MEASURES, WHICH ARE MONITORED AND MANAGED BY MARKET RISK, CONSISTENT WITH OTHER INVENTORY POSITIONS. WE ALSO ENTER INTO DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE MARKET RISK EXPOSURES. SUCH DERIVATIVES ALSO GIVE RISE TO CREDIT RISK, WHICH IS MONITORED AND MANAGED BY CREDIT RISK.  CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS  OUR PROCESS FOR MANAGING CREDIT RISK INCLUDES.  \u2022  COLLECTING COMPLETE, ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION;  \u2022  APPROVING TRANSACTIONS AND SETTING AND COMMUNICATING CREDIT EXPOSURE LIMITS;  \u2022  MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH ESTABLISHED CREDIT RISK LIMITS AND REPORTING OUR EXPOSURE;  \u2022  ESTABLISHING OR APPROVING UNDERWRITING STANDARDS;  \u2022  ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A COUNTERPARTY WILL DEFAULT ON ITS PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS;  \u2022  MEASURING OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM A COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT;  \u2022  USING CREDIT RISK MITIGANTS, INCLUDING COLLATERAL AND HEDGING;  \u2022  MAXIMIZING RECOVERY THROUGH ACTIVE WORKOUT AND RESTRUCTURING OF CLAIMS; AND  \u2022  ENSURING PROACTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS.  AS PART OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS, WE PERFORM CREDIT REVIEWS, WHICH INCLUDE INITIAL AND ONGOING ANALYSES OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES. FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES, THE CORE OF OUR PROCESS IS AN ANNUAL COUNTERPARTY CREDIT REVIEW. A CREDIT REVIEW IS AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF THE CAPACITY AND WILLINGNESS OF A COUNTERPARTY TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS, RESULTING IN AN INTERNAL CREDIT RATING. THE DETERMINATION OF INTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS ALSO INCORPORATES ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE NATURE OF AND OUTLOOK FOR THE COUNTERPARTY\u2019S INDUSTRY, AND THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. SENIOR PERSONNEL, WITH EXPERTISE IN SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES, INSPECT AND APPROVE CREDIT REVIEWS AND INTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS.  135  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OUR RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS MAY ALSO INCLUDE, WHERE APPLICABLE, REVIEWING CERTAIN KEY METRICS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DELINQUENCY STATUS, COLLATERAL VALUES, FAIR ISAAC CORPORATION CREDIT SCORES AND OTHER RISK FACTORS.  OUR GLOBAL CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS CAPTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTIES AND ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS TO COUNTERPARTIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES. THESE SYSTEMS ALSO PROVIDE MANAGEMENT WITH COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR AGGREGATE CREDIT RISK BY PRODUCT, INTERNAL CREDIT RATING, INDUSTRY, COUNTRY AND REGION.  RISK MEASURES AND LIMITS  WE MEASURE OUR CREDIT RISK BASED ON THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN THE EVENT OF  NON-PAYMENT  BY A COUNTERPARTY USING CURRENT AND POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. FOR DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, CURRENT EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT PRESENTLY OWED TO US AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT APPLICABLE NETTING AND COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS, WHILE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE REPRESENTS OUR ESTIMATE OF THE FUTURE EXPOSURE THAT COULD ARISE OVER THE LIFE OF A TRANSACTION BASED ON MARKET MOVEMENTS WITHIN A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL. POTENTIAL EXPOSURE ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT NETTING AND COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS. FOR LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS, THE PRIMARY MEASURE IS A FUNCTION OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE POSITION.  WE USE CREDIT RISK LIMITS AT VARIOUS LEVELS, AS WELL AS UNDERWRITING STANDARDS TO MANAGE THE SIZE AND NATURE OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES. LIMITS FOR INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES ARE BASED ON OUR RISK APPETITE AND ARE DESIGNED TO ALLOW FOR REGULAR MONITORING, REVIEW, ESCALATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CREDIT RISK CONCENTRATIONS. SEE \u201cOVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE LIMIT APPROVAL PROCESS.  POLICIES AUTHORIZED BY THE FIRMWIDE ENTERPRISE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE RISK GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE PRESCRIBE THE LEVEL OF FORMAL APPROVAL REQUIRED FOR US TO ASSUME CREDIT EXPOSURE TO A COUNTERPARTY ACROSS ALL PRODUCT AREAS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY APPLICABLE NETTING PROVISIONS, COLLATERAL OR OTHER CREDIT RISK MITIGANTS.  CREDIT RISK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THESE LIMITS, AND IDENTIFYING AND ESCALATING TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND/OR THE APPROPRIATE RISK COMMITTEE, ON A TIMELY BASIS, INSTANCES WHERE LIMITS HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED.  STRESS TESTS  WE USE REGULAR STRESS TESTS TO CALCULATE THE CREDIT EXPOSURES, INCLUDING POTENTIAL CONCENTRATIONS THAT WOULD RESULT FROM APPLYING SHOCKS TO COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RATINGS OR CREDIT RISK FACTORS (E.G., CURRENCY RATES, INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES). THESE SHOCKS INCLUDE A WIDE RANGE OF MODERATE AND MORE EXTREME MARKET MOVEMENTS. SOME OF OUR STRESS TESTS INCLUDE SHOCKS TO MULTIPLE RISK FACTORS, CONSISTENT WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF A SEVERE MARKET OR ECONOMIC EVENT. IN THE CASE OF SOVEREIGN DEFAULT, WE ESTIMATE THE DIRECT IMPACT OF THE DEFAULT ON OUR SOVEREIGN CREDIT EXPOSURES, CHANGES TO OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ARISING FROM POTENTIAL MARKET MOVES IN RESPONSE TO THE DEFAULT, AND THE IMPACT OF CREDIT MARKET DETERIORATION ON CORPORATE BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SOVEREIGN DEFAULT. UNLIKE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE, WHICH IS CALCULATED WITHIN A SPECIFIED CONFIDENCE LEVEL, WITH A STRESS TEST THERE IS GENERALLY NO ASSUMED PROBABILITY OF THESE EVENTS OCCURRING. WE ALSO PERFORM FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS. SEE \u201cOVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR INFORMATION ABOUT FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS.  MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION  OUR POTENTIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE AND STRESS TESTING MODELS, AND ANY CHANGES TO SUCH MODELS OR ASSUMPTIONS, ARE INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED, VALIDATED AND APPROVED BY MODEL RISK. SEE \u201cMODEL RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  RISK MITIGANTS  TO REDUCE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ON DERIVATIVES AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, WE MAY ENTER INTO NETTING AGREEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT PERMIT US TO OFFSET RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTIES. WE MAY ALSO REDUCE CREDIT RISK WITH COUNTERPARTIES BY ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS THAT ENABLE US TO OBTAIN COLLATERAL FROM THEM ON AN UPFRONT OR CONTINGENT BASIS AND/OR TO TERMINATE TRANSACTIONS IF THE COUNTERPARTY\u2019S CREDIT RATING FALLS BELOW A SPECIFIED LEVEL. WE MONITOR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL TO ENSURE THAT OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ARE APPROPRIATELY COLLATERALIZED. WE SEEK TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURES WHERE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES AND THE MARKET VALUE OF COLLATERAL WE RECEIVE.  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  136  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  FOR LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS, DEPENDING ON THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE BORROWER AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRANSACTION, WE EMPLOY A VARIETY OF POTENTIAL RISK MITIGANTS. RISK MITIGANTS INCLUDE COLLATERAL PROVISIONS, GUARANTEES, COVENANTS, STRUCTURAL SENIORITY OF THE BANK LOAN CLAIMS AND, FOR CERTAIN LENDING COMMITMENTS, PROVISIONS IN THE LEGAL DOCUMENTATION THAT ALLOW US TO ADJUST LOAN AMOUNTS, PRICING, STRUCTURE AND OTHER TERMS AS MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE. THE TYPE AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MITIGANTS EMPLOYED CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE DEGREE OF CREDIT RISK INVOLVED IN A LOAN OR LENDING COMMITMENT.  WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT VISIBILITY INTO A COUNTERPARTY\u2019S FINANCIAL STRENGTH OR WHEN WE BELIEVE A COUNTERPARTY REQUIRES SUPPORT FROM ITS PARENT, WE MAY OBTAIN THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES OF THE COUNTERPARTY\u2019S OBLIGATIONS. WE MAY ALSO MITIGATE OUR CREDIT RISK USING CREDIT DERIVATIVES OR PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS.  CREDIT EXPOSURES  AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, OUR AGGREGATE CREDIT EXPOSURE DECREASED AS COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 2018, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A DECREASE IN CASH DEPOSITS WITH CENTRAL BANKS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS AND SECURITIES FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ARISING FROM  NON-INVESTMENT-GRADE  COUNTERPARTIES (BASED ON OUR INTERNALLY DETERMINED PUBLIC RATING AGENCY EQUIVALENTS) INCREASED AS COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 2018, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A DECREASE IN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATED TO CASH DEPOSITS WITH CENTRAL BANKS. OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTIES THAT DEFAULTED DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019 WAS HIGHER AS COMPARED WITH OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTIES THAT DEFAULTED DURING THE SAME PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AND SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF SUCH EXPOSURE WAS RELATED TO LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS. OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO COUNTERPARTIES THAT DEFAULTED DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 2019 REMAINED LOW, REPRESENTING LESS THAN 0.5% OF OUR TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE. ESTIMATED LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEFAULTS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. OUR CREDIT EXPOSURES ARE DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE ON CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARISES FROM OUR UNRESTRICTED CASH, AND INCLUDES BOTH INTEREST-BEARING AND  NON-INTEREST-BEARING  DEPOSITS.

AS A MARKET MAKER, WE ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO CLIENTS AND TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER AND HEDGING OF THEIR RISKS. WE ALSO ENTER INTO DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE MARKET RISK EXPOSURES. WE MANAGE OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE ON OTC DERIVATIVES USING THE CREDIT RISK PROCESS, MEASURES, LIMITS AND RISK MITIGANTS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  WE GENERALLY ENTER INTO OTC DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS UNDER BILATERAL COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT REQUIRE THE DAILY EXCHANGE OF COLLATERAL. AS CREDIT RISK IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF FAIR VALUE, WE INCLUDE A CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA) IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES TO REFLECT COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. CVA IS A FUNCTION OF THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED EXPOSURE, THE PROBABILITY OF COUNTERPARTY DEFAULT AND THE ASSUMED RECOVERY UPON DEFAULT.  137  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  HIGH INFLATION IN TURKEY COMBINED WITH CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICITS AND SIGNIFICANT DEPRECIATION OF THE TURKISH LIRA HAS LED TO CONCERNS ABOUT ITS ECONOMIC STABILITY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, OUR TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE TO TURKEY WAS $1.98 BILLION, WHICH WAS WITH  NON-SOVEREIGN  COUNTERPARTIES OR BORROWERS. SUCH EXPOSURE CONSISTED OF $1.55 BILLION RELATED TO OTC DERIVATIVES, $231 MILLION RELATED TO LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS AND $201 MILLION RELATED TO SECURED RECEIVABLES. AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE BENEFIT OF TURKISH CORPORATE AND SOVEREIGN COLLATERAL AND OTHER RISK MITIGANTS PROVIDED BY TURKISH COUNTERPARTIES, OUR NET CREDIT EXPOSURE WAS $300 MILLION. IN ADDITION, OUR TOTAL MARKET EXPOSURE TO TURKEY AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019 WAS $664 MILLION, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY WITH SOVEREIGN ISSUERS OR UNDERLIERS. SUCH EXPOSURE CONSISTED OF $972 MILLION RELATED TO DEBT, $(319) MILLION RELATED TO CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND $11 MILLION RELATED TO EQUITIES.  SIGNIFICANT DEPRECIATION OF THE ARGENTINE PESO HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER INFLATION AND HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT ARGENTINA\u2019S ECONOMIC STABILITY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, OUR TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ARGENTINA WAS $194 MILLION, WHICH WAS WITH  NON-SOVEREIGN  COUNTERPARTIES OR BORROWERS, AND WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR TOTAL MARKET EXPOSURE TO ARGENTINA WAS $179 MILLION, PRIMARILY REFLECTING DEBT EXPOSURE WITH SOVEREIGN ISSUERS OR UNDERLIERS.  THE POTENTIAL RESTRUCTURING OF LEBANON\u2019S SOVEREIGN DEBT HAS LED TO CONCERNS ABOUT ITS FINANCIAL STABILITY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO LEBANON WAS $674 MILLION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH RELATED TO LOANS AND LENDING COMMITMENTS WITH  NON-SOVEREIGN  BORROWERS. AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE BENEFIT OF CASH AND LEBANESE SOVEREIGN COLLATERAL RECEIVED, OUR NET CREDIT EXPOSURE WAS NOT MATERIAL. IN ADDITION, OUR TOTAL MARKET EXPOSURE TO LEBANON AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019 WAS NOT MATERIAL.  VENEZUELA HAS DELAYED PAYMENTS ON ITS SOVEREIGN DEBT AND ITS POLITICAL SITUATION REMAINS UNCLEAR. AS OF SEPTEMBER 2019, OUR TOTAL CREDIT AND MARKET EXPOSURE FOR VENEZUELA WAS NOT MATERIAL.  WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK TO MONITOR, MEASURE AND ASSESS OUR COUNTRY EXPOSURES AND TO DETERMINE OUR RISK APPETITE. WE DETERMINE THE COUNTRY OF RISK BY THE LOCATION OF THE COUNTERPARTY, ISSUER OR UNDERLIER\u2019S ASSETS, WHERE THEY GENERATE REVENUE, THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY ARE HEADQUARTERED, THE JURISDICTION WHERE A CLAIM AGAINST THEM COULD BE ENFORCED, AND/OR THE GOVERNMENT WHOSE POLICIES AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO REPAY THEIR OBLIGATIONS. WE MONITOR OUR CREDIT EXPOSURE TO A SPECIFIC COUNTRY BOTH AT THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTERPARTY LEVEL, AS WELL AS AT THE AGGREGATE COUNTRY LEVEL.  WE USE REGULAR STRESS TESTS, DESCRIBED ABOVE, TO CALCULATE THE CREDIT EXPOSURES, INCLUDING POTENTIAL CONCENTRATIONS THAT WOULD RESULT FROM APPLYING SHOCKS TO COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RATINGS OR CREDIT RISK FACTORS. TO SUPPLEMENT THESE REGULAR STRESS TESTS, WE ALSO CONDUCT TAILORED STRESS TESTS ON AN AD HOC BASIS IN RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC MARKET EVENTS THAT WE DEEM SIGNIFICANT. THESE STRESS TESTS ARE DESIGNED TO ESTIMATE THE DIRECT IMPACT OF THE EVENT ON OUR CREDIT AND MARKET EXPOSURES RESULTING FROM SHOCKS TO RISK FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CURRENCY RATES, INTEREST RATES AND EQUITY PRICES. WE ALSO UTILIZE THESE STRESS TESTS TO ESTIMATE THE INDIRECT IMPACT OF CERTAIN HYPOTHETICAL EVENTS ON OUR COUNTRY EXPOSURES, SUCH AS THE IMPACT OF CREDIT MARKET DETERIORATION ON CORPORATE BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES ALONG WITH THE SHOCKS TO THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE PARAMETERS OF THESE SHOCKS VARY BASED ON THE SCENARIO REFLECTED IN EACH STRESS TEST. WE REVIEW ESTIMATED LOSSES PRODUCED BY THE STRESS TESTS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THEIR MAGNITUDE, HIGHLIGHT POTENTIAL LOSS CONCENTRATIONS, AND ASSESS AND MITIGATE OUR EXPOSURES WHERE NECESSARY.  OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT  OVERVIEW  OPERATIONAL RISK IS THE RISK OF AN ADVERSE OUTCOME RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE OR FAILED INTERNAL PROCESSES, PEOPLE, SYSTEMS OR FROM EXTERNAL EVENTS. OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL RISK ARISES FROM ROUTINE PROCESSING ERRORS, AS WELL AS EXTRAORDINARY INCIDENTS, SUCH AS MAJOR SYSTEMS FAILURES OR LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS.  POTENTIAL TYPES OF LOSS EVENTS RELATED TO INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK INCLUDE.  \u2022  CLIENTS, PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS PRACTICES;  \u2022  EXECUTION, DELIVERY AND PROCESS MANAGEMENT;  \u2022  BUSINESS DISRUPTION AND SYSTEM FAILURES;  \u2022  EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES AND WORKPLACE SAFETY;  \u2022  DAMAGE TO PHYSICAL ASSETS;  \u2022  INTERNAL FRAUD; AND  \u2022  EXTERNAL FRAUD.  141  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

THE FIRMWIDE CONDUCT AND OPERATIONAL RISK COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ONGOING APPROVAL AND MONITORING OF THE FRAMEWORKS, POLICIES, PARAMETERS, LIMITS AND THRESHOLDS WHICH GOVERN OUR OPERATIONAL RISKS.  OPERATIONAL RISK, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF RISK OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING A FORMALIZED FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING OPERATIONAL RISK WITH THE GOAL OF MAINTAINING OUR EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL RISK AT LEVELS THAT ARE WITHIN OUR RISK APPETITE.  OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS  OUR PROCESS FOR MANAGING OPERATIONAL RISK INCLUDES.  \u2022  COLLECTING COMPLETE, ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION;  \u2022  TRAINING, SUPERVISION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PEOPLE;  \u2022  ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN IDENTIFYING AND MITIGATING OUR KEY OPERATIONAL RISKS;  \u2022  INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS THAT MONITOR OPERATIONAL RISK, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE OCCURRENCE OF OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS; AND  \u2022  ENSURING PROACTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS AND OUR INDEPENDENT RISK OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS.  WE COMBINE  TOP-DOWN  AND  BOTTOM-UP  APPROACHES TO MANAGE AND MEASURE OPERATIONAL RISK. FROM A  TOP-DOWN  PERSPECTIVE, OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT ASSESSES FIRMWIDE AND BUSINESS-LEVEL OPERATIONAL RISK PROFILES. FROM A  BOTTOM-UP  PERSPECTIVE, OUR FIRST AND SECOND LINES OF DEFENSE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR RISK IDENTIFICATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT ON A  DAY-TO-DAY  BASIS, INCLUDING ESCALATING OPERATIONAL RISKS TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT.  OUR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS IN PART DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH THE OPERATIONAL RISK MEASUREMENT RULES UNDER THE CAPITAL FRAMEWORK AND HAS EVOLVED BASED ON THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESSES AND REGULATORY GUIDANCE.  OUR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING PRACTICES.  \u2022  RISK IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT;  \u2022  RISK MEASUREMENT; AND  \u2022  RISK MONITORING AND REPORTING.  RISK IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT  THE CORE OF OUR OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS RISK IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT. WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS, INCLUDING FIRMWIDE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, FOR OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS.  WE HAVE ESTABLISHED POLICIES THAT REQUIRE ALL EMPLOYEES TO REPORT AND ESCALATE OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS. WHEN OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS ARE IDENTIFIED, OUR POLICIES REQUIRE THAT THE EVENTS BE DOCUMENTED AND ANALYZED TO DETERMINE WHETHER CHANGES ARE REQUIRED IN OUR SYSTEMS AND/OR PROCESSES TO FURTHER MITIGATE THE RISK OF FUTURE EVENTS.  WE USE OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT APPLICATIONS TO CAPTURE AND ORGANIZE OPERATIONAL RISK EVENT DATA AND KEY METRICS. ONE OF OUR KEY RISK IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS IS AN OPERATIONAL RISK AND CONTROL SELF-ASSESSMENT PROCESS, WHICH IS PERFORMED BY OUR MANAGERS. THIS PROCESS CONSISTS OF THE IDENTIFICATION AND RATING OF OPERATIONAL RISKS, ON A FORWARD-LOOKING BASIS, AND THE RELATED CONTROLS. THE RESULTS FROM THIS PROCESS ARE ANALYZED TO EVALUATE OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURES AND IDENTIFY BUSINESSES, ACTIVITIES OR PRODUCTS WITH HEIGHTENED LEVELS OF OPERATIONAL RISK.  RISK MEASUREMENT  WE MEASURE OUR OPERATIONAL RISK EXPOSURE USING BOTH STATISTICAL MODELING AND SCENARIO ANALYSES, WHICH INVOLVE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENTS OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPERATIONAL RISK EVENT DATA AND INTERNAL CONTROL FACTORS FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES. OPERATIONAL RISK MEASUREMENT ALSO INCORPORATES AN ASSESSMENT OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO.  \u2022  EVALUATIONS OF THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES;  \u2022  THE DEGREE OF AUTOMATION IN OUR PROCESSES;  \u2022  NEW ACTIVITY INFORMATION;  \u2022  THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT; AND  \u2022  CHANGES IN THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING THE DIVERSITY AND SOPHISTICATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES.  THE RESULTS FROM THESE SCENARIO ANALYSES ARE USED TO MONITOR CHANGES IN OPERATIONAL RISK AND TO DETERMINE BUSINESS LINES THAT MAY HAVE HEIGHTENED EXPOSURE TO OPERATIONAL RISK. THESE ANALYSES ARE USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF OPERATIONAL RISK CAPITAL TO HOLD. WE ALSO PERFORM FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS. SEE \u201cOVERVIEW AND STRUCTURE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR INFORMATION ABOUT FIRMWIDE STRESS TESTS.  GOLDMAN SACHS SEPTEMBER 2019 FORM 10-Q  142  THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

WE HAVE BOTH PREVENTIVE AND DETECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF OPERATIONAL RISK LOSSES AND THE PROBABILITY OF OPERATIONAL RISK EVENTS. WE MONITOR THE RESULTS OF ASSESSMENTS AND INDEPENDENT INTERNAL AUDITS OF THESE INTERNAL CONTROLS.  WE HAVE ESTABLISHED OPERATIONAL RISK LIMITS AND THRESHOLDS CONSISTENT WITH OUR RISK APPETITE STATEMENT, AS WELL AS ESCALATION PROTOCOLS. OPERATIONAL RISK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THESE LIMITS AND THRESHOLDS, AND IDENTIFYING AND ESCALATING TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND/OR THE APPROPRIATE RISK COMMITTEE, ON A TIMELY BASIS, INSTANCES WHERE LIMITS AND THRESHOLDS HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED.

SEE \u201cMODEL RISK MANAGEMENT\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT  OVERVIEW  MODEL RISK IS THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FROM DECISIONS MADE BASED ON MODEL OUTPUTS THAT MAY BE INCORRECT OR USED INAPPROPRIATELY. WE RELY ON QUANTITATIVE MODELS ACROSS OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY TO VALUE CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, TO MONITOR AND MANAGE OUR RISK, AND TO MEASURE AND MONITOR OUR REGULATORY CAPITAL.  OUR MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS MANAGED THROUGH A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND RISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS, WHICH ENCOMPASS STANDARDS DESIGNED TO ENSURE WE MAINTAIN A COMPREHENSIVE MODEL INVENTORY, INCLUDING RISK ASSESSMENT AND CLASSIFICATION, SOUND MODEL DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES, INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND MODEL-SPECIFIC USAGE CONTROLS. THE FIRMWIDE MODEL RISK CONTROL COMMITTEE OVERSEES OUR MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK.  MODEL RISK, WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF OUR REVENUE-PRODUCING UNITS, MODEL DEVELOPERS, MODEL OWNERS AND MODEL USERS, AND REPORTS TO OUR CHIEF RISK OFFICER, HAS PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING, MONITORING AND MANAGING OUR MODEL RISK THROUGH FIRMWIDE OVERSIGHT ACROSS OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES, AND PROVIDES PERIODIC UPDATES TO SENIOR MANAGEMENT, RISK COMMITTEES AND THE RISK COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD.  MODEL REVIEW AND VALIDATION PROCESS  MODEL RISK CONSISTS OF QUANTITATIVE PROFESSIONALS WHO PERFORM AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW, VALIDATION AND APPROVAL OF OUR MODELS. THIS REVIEW INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF THE MODEL DOCUMENTATION, INDEPENDENT TESTING, AN ASSESSMENT OF THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE METHODOLOGY USED, AND VERIFICATION OF COMPLIANCE WITH MODEL DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS. ALL EXISTING MODELS ARE REVIEWED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, AND NEW MODELS OR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO MODELS ARE APPROVED PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION.  THE MODEL VALIDATION PROCESS INCORPORATES A REVIEW OF MODELS AND TRADE AND RISK PARAMETERS ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF SCENARIOS (INCLUDING EXTREME CONDITIONS) IN ORDER TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE AND VERIFY.  \u2022  THE MODEL\u2019S CONCEPTUAL SOUNDNESS, INCLUDING THE REASONABLENESS OF MODEL ASSUMPTIONS, AND SUITABILITY FOR INTENDED USE;  \u2022  THE TESTING STRATEGY UTILIZED BY THE MODEL DEVELOPERS TO ENSURE THAT THE MODELS FUNCTION AS INTENDED;  \u2022  THE SUITABILITY OF THE CALCULATION TECHNIQUES INCORPORATED IN THE MODEL;  \u2022  THE MODEL\u2019S ACCURACY IN REFLECTING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RELATED PRODUCT AND ITS SIGNIFICANT RISKS;  \u2022  THE MODEL\u2019S CONSISTENCY WITH MODELS FOR SIMILAR PRODUCTS; AND  \u2022  THE MODEL\u2019S SENSITIVITY TO INPUT PARAMETERS AND ASSUMPTIONS.

THE PROFESSIONALS WE PLACE ARE RECRUITED NATIONWIDE AND ARE TYPICALLY PLACED ON CONTRACTS WITH ASSIGNMENT LENGTHS RANGING FROM A FEW DAYS TO ONE YEAR.  OTHER WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS SEGMENT REVENUE COMPRISED  22%  AND  20%  OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUE FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THROUGH OUR OTHER WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, WE PROVIDE HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE FACILITIES WITH A RANGE OF WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING: (1) IDENTIFYING AND RECRUITING PHYSICIANS AND HEALTHCARE LEADERS FOR PERMANENT PLACEMENT, (2) PLACING INTERIM LEADERS AND EXECUTIVES ACROSS ALL HEALTHCARE SETTINGS, (3) A SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (\u201cSAAS\u201d) VMS THROUGH WHICH OUR CLIENTS CAN MANAGE THEIR TEMPORARY STAFFING NEEDS, (4) RPO SERVICES THAT LEVERAGE OUR EXPERTISE AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS TO REPLACE OR COMPLEMENT A CLIENT\u2019S EXISTING INTERNAL RECRUITMENT FUNCTION FOR PERMANENT PLACEMENT NEEDS, (5) AN EDUCATION PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES CUSTOM HEALTHCARE EDUCATION, RESEARCH, PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE TOOLS, AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SERVICES, (6) REVENUE CYCLE SOLUTIONS AND RELATED CONSULTING SERVICES, (7)  21  WORKFORCE OPTIMIZATION SERVICES THAT INCLUDE CONSULTING, DATA ANALYTICS, PREDICTIVE MODELING, AND SAAS-BASED SCHEDULING TECHNOLOGY, AND (8) CREDENTIALING SERVICES.

ADVANCED IS A NATIONAL HEALTHCARE STAFFING COMPANY THAT SPECIALIZES IN PLACING THERAPISTS AND NURSES ACROSS MULTIPLE SETTINGS, INCLUDING HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS, CLINICS, SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES, AND HOME HEALTH. SILVERSHEET PROVIDES INNOVATIVE CREDENTIALING SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS TO CLINICIANS AND HEALTHCARE ENTERPRISES. MEDPARTNERS PROVIDES REVENUE CYCLE SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING CASE MANAGEMENT, CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION IMPROVEMENT, MEDICAL CODING AND REGISTRY SERVICES TO HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIAN MEDICAL GROUPS NATIONWIDE. PDA AND LFT OFFER A RANGE OF LEADERSHIP STAFFING AND PERMANENT PLACEMENT SOLUTIONS FOR THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. SEE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTE (2), \u201cACQUISITIONS.\u201d  RECENT TRENDS  DEMAND FOR OUR TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT PLACEMENT STAFFING SERVICES IS DRIVEN IN PART BY U.S. ECONOMIC AND LABOR TRENDS. THE U.S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS\u2019 SURVEY DATA REFLECTS NEAR RECORD LEVELS OF HEALTHCARE JOB OPENINGS AND QUITS. WE VIEW THIS DATA, ALONG WITH A NEARLY 20-YEAR-LOW UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND CONTINUED ECONOMIC GROWTH AS POSITIVE TRENDS FOR THE HEALTHCARE STAFFING INDUSTRY. THESE POSITIVE MACRO ECONOMIC AND LABOR TRENDS HAVE CREATED A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE LABOR MARKET FOR CLINICIANS AND OUR CLINICIAN SUPPLY, PARTICULARLY IN NURSING, HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH GROWTH IN CLIENT DEMAND.  THE CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY IS CREATING LARGER, MORE SOPHISTICATED AND COMPLEX HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT WE BELIEVE HAS ELEVATED THE NEED FOR STRATEGIC WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS CAPABLE OF PARTNERING TO SOLVE THEIR RECRUITING, STAFFING AND WORKFORCE OPTIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS. GIVEN THE INCREASING NEED FOR PARTNERS CAPABLE OF OFFERING A COMPREHENSIVE WORKFORCE SOLUTION, WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF OUR WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS STRATEGY, PARTICULARLY WITH OUR MSPS. AS A RESULT OF OUR ONGOING FOCUS ON THESE STRATEGIC MSP RELATIONSHIPS, THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR STAFFING REVENUE DERIVED FROM OUR MSP CLIENTS CONTINUES TO INCREASE, AND WE BELIEVE THESE STRATEGIC, LONGER-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WILL CONTINUE TO COMPRISE A GREATER PROPORTION OF REVENUE IN OUR STAFFING BUSINESSES.  IN OUR NURSE AND ALLIED SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, OVERALL DEMAND IS STRONG AND AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS SEEN SINCE 2016. HOWEVER, PLACEMENT ACTIVITY HAS BEEN UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED BY FEWER CONTINGENT NURSE STAFFING NEEDS FROM A LARGE CLIENT. ADDITIONALLY, A TIGHT LABOR MARKET AND MODEST GROWTH IN BILL RATES IS ALSO IMPACTING OUR ABILITY TO SUFFICIENTLY RECRUIT THE NURSES TO MEET THE INCREASED DEMAND. OUR ALLIED STAFFING BUSINESS CONTINUES TO HAVE STRONG OVERALL DEMAND RESULTING IN STEADY ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH. HOWEVER, WE HAVE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR THERAPISTS FROM OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY CLIENTS THAT IS RESULTING FROM RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT CHANGES. THE ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL SUPPLY OF NURSE AND ALLIED HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS FROM THE ADVANCED ACQUISITION HAS HELPED US BETTER ADDRESS OUR CLIENT\u2019S STAFFING DEMANDS.  THE DEMAND ENVIRONMENT FOR LOCUM TENENS IS ALSO GENERALLY FAVORABLE, ALTHOUGH DEMAND FOR HOSPITALISTS AND EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIANS HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS. OUR LOCUM TENENS BUSINESS HAS STABILIZED AFTER DISRUPTION RESULTING FROM PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY CHANGES MADE DURING 2018, AND RECRUITER PRODUCTIVITY CONTINUES TO IMPROVE.  IN OUR OTHER WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, BETTER DEMAND AND PLACEMENTS IN THE INTERIM LEADERSHIP AND PHYSICIAN PERMANENT PLACEMENT DIVISIONS AND GROWTH IN TECHNOLOGY WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS ARE DRIVING IMPROVED SEGMENT PERFORMANCE AND OUR PROFITABILITY ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. SINCE EXPERIENCING A DECLINE IN OUR REVENUE CYCLE SOLUTIONS REVENUE IN RECENT QUARTERS, REVENUE FOR THIS DIVISION HAS SEEN SIGNS OF STABILIZATION DUE IN PART TO GROWING OPPORTUNITIES TO SERVE OUR MSP CUSTOMERS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT OUR REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE  22  OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS PURCHASED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, ACCRUALS FOR SELF-INSURANCE, COMPENSATION AND RELATED BENEFITS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION, EARN-OUT LIABILITIES, AND INCOME TAXES. WE BASE THESE ESTIMATES ON THE INFORMATION THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO US AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD VARY FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. IF THESE ESTIMATES DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS, OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, OTHER THAN THE ADOPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-02 DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1. CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014NOTE 1, \u201cBASIS OF PRESENTATION,\u201d AS COMPARED TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDE THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: (1) NURSE AND ALLIED SOLUTIONS, (2) LOCUM TENENS SOLUTIONS, AND (3) OTHER WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS. THE PDA, LFT, MEDPARTNERS, SILVERSHEET AND ADVANCED ACQUISITIONS IMPACT THE COMPARABILITY OF THE RESULTS BETWEEN THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF THE APPLICABLE ACQUISITION.

REVENUE  INCREASED  8%  TO  $567.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  FROM  $526.8 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ADDITIONAL REVENUE OF  $37.0 MILLION  FROM OUR SILVERSHEET AND ADVANCED ACQUISITIONS AND HIGHER ORGANIC REVENUE IN OUR NURSE AND ALLIED SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUE IN OUR LOCUM TENENS SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. EXCLUDING THE ADDITIONAL REVENUE FROM ACQUISITIONS, REVENUE INCREASED  1%.  NURSE AND ALLIED SOLUTIONS SEGMENT REVENUE  INCREASED  18%  TO  $362.5 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  FROM  $306.3 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . THE  $56.2 MILLION  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO  $36.6 MILLION  OF REVENUE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADVANCED ACQUISITION, A  2%  INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS ON ASSIGNMENT, AND A  2%  INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE BILL RATE DURING THE DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  LOCUM TENENS SOLUTIONS SEGMENT REVENUE  DECREASED  17%  TO  $84.2 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  FROM  $101.1 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . THE  $16.9 MILLION  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A  15%  DECREASE  IN THE NUMBER OF DAYS FILLED AND A  2%  DECREASE  IN THE REVENUE PER DAY FILLED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  OTHER WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS SEGMENT REVENUE  INCREASED  1%  TO  $120.9 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  FROM  $119.4 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . THE  $1.5 MILLION  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN OUR INTERIM LEADERSHIP, PERMANENT PLACEMENT, RECRUITMENT PROCESS OUTSOURCING, AND VMS BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN OUR REVENUE CYCLE SOLUTIONS BUSINESS DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT  INCREASED  8%  TO  $190.0 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  FROM  $175.1 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , REPRESENTING GROSS MARGINS OF  33.5%  AND  33.2%  , RESPECTIVELY. THE GROSS MARGIN FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  WAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY A HIGHER GROSS MARGIN IN OUR NURSE AND ALLIED SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, DRIVEN BY A HIGHER LABOR DISRUPTION MARGIN AND PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER TRAVELER HOUSING COSTS, AND HIGHER OTHER WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS GROSS MARGIN. THESE POSITIVE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER MARGIN IN OUR LOCUM TENENS SOLUTIONS SEGMENT AND AN UNFAVORABLE SEGMENT MIX SHIFT. GROSS MARGIN BY REPORTABLE SEGMENT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  WAS  27.9%  AND  27.4%  FOR NURSE AND ALLIED SOLUTIONS,  27.5%  AND  28.4%  FOR LOCUM TENENS SOLUTIONS, AND  54.3%  AND  52.4%  FOR OTHER WORKFORCE SOLUTIONS, RESPECTIVELY. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROSS MARGIN DECLINE IN THE LOCUM TENENS SOLUTIONS SEGMENT WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER PERM CONVERSION FEES.  23  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cSG&A\u201d) EXPENSES WERE  $133.2 MILLION  , REPRESENTING  23.5%  OF REVENUE, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO  $121.2 MILLION  , REPRESENTING  23.0%  OF REVENUE, FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN SG&A EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO  $6.8 MILLION  OF ADDITIONAL SG&A EXPENSES FROM THE SILVERSHEET AND ADVANCED ACQUISITIONS, A  $10.1 MILLION  INCREASE RELATED TO ACQUISITION, INTEGRATION, CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF EARN-OUT LIABILITIES FROM ACQUISITIONS, AND EXTRAORDINARY LEGAL EXPENSES, HIGHER EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION EXPENSES, AND OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR REVENUE GROWTH. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A  $12.1 MILLION  INCREASE IN LEGAL ACCRUALS DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  . SG&A EXPENSES BROKEN DOWN AMONG THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, UNALLOCATED CORPORATE OVERHEAD, AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARE AS FOLLOWS.

DEPRECIATION EXPENSE INCREASED  24%  TO  $5.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  FROM  $4.6 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN PURCHASED AND DEVELOPED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PLACED IN SERVICE FOR OUR ONGOING FRONT AND BACK OFFICE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, AND OTHER.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, AND OTHER, WAS  $7.8 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $4.6 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . THE  INCREASE  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT OUTSTANDING BALANCE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WHICH RESULTED FROM BORROWINGS USED TO FINANCE THE SILVERSHEET AND ADVANCED ACQUISITIONS, AND A $1.4 MILLION GAIN RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ANALYZING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS STANDARD AND EVALUATING THE IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS INCLUDES REVIEWING CURRENT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL DIFFERENCES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM APPLYING THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE NEW STANDARD. WE COMPLETED OUR PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT AND EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF THE ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES, CONTROLS AND SYSTEMS BY THE END OF 2019. WE WILL ADOPT THIS STANDARD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AND DO NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-04, \u201cSIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.\u201d THE STANDARD SIMPLIFIES THE SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT OF GOODWILL BY REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT TO PERFORM A HYPOTHETICAL PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION TO COMPUTE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL TO MEASURE IMPAIRMENT. INSTEAD, ANY GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WILL EQUAL THE AMOUNT BY WHICH A REPORTING UNIT\u2019S CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, NOT TO EXCEED THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL. FURTHER, THE GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY REPORTING UNIT WITH A ZERO OR NEGATIVE CARRYING AMOUNT TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT AND, IF IT FAILS THAT QUALITATIVE TEST, TO PERFORM STEP 2 OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL OR ANY INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTS PERFORMED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2017.

THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE CAPITALIZED IMPLEMENTATION COSTS TO BE RECORDED AS AN OTHER ASSET, RATHER THAN A FIXED ASSET, AND THE RELATED AMORTIZATION OF THOSE COSTS TO BE RECORDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE ON A PROSPECTIVE OR RETROSPECTIVE BASIS FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR CONSOLIDATED TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO WAS 10.9% AND OUR CONSOLIDATED TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL AND COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS WERE BOTH 12.9%.  \u25cf  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMMON BOOK VALUE PER SHARE WAS $24.17, WHILE TANGIBLE COMMON BOOK VALUE PER SHARE WAS $20.45.  \u25cf  FROM EARLY 2013 THROUGH OCTOBER 2016, WE HAVE REPURCHASED 26.6 MILLION SHARES, OR 51.7% OF OUR SHARES, AT AN ATTRACTIVE WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF $20.03 PER SHARE.  \u200b  KEY CHALLENGES  \u200b  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES CONFRONTING US AND OUR INDUSTRY. WE BEGAN BANKING OPERATIONS IN 2010 BY ACQUIRING DISTRESSED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND SOUGHT TO REBUILD THEM AND IMPLEMENT OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES ACROSS THE ENTERPRISE AS A WHOLE. WE FACE CONTINUAL CHALLENGES IMPLEMENTING OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, INCLUDING GROWING THE ASSETS, PARTICULARLY LOANS, AND DEPOSITS OF OUR BUSINESS AMIDST INTENSE COMPETITION, CHANGING INTEREST RATES, ADHERING TO CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND IDENTIFYING AND CONSUMMATING DISCIPLINED ACQUISITION AND OTHER EXPANSIONARY OPPORTUNITIES IN A VERY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WHILE AT THE BEGINNING OF 2019 WE ANTICIPATED A GENERALLY RISING RATE ENVIRONMENT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, PREVAILING INTEREST RATES BEGAN DECREASING DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND GENERALLY HAVE CONTINUED TO DECREASE SINCE THAT TIME AS A RESULT OF THREE FEDERAL RESERVE RATE CUTS THROUGH OCTOBER 2019.  \u200b  GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS REMAINED STABLE IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019. AMIDST NATIONAL ECONOMIC CONCERNS SURROUNDING TRADE TENSIONS AND INDICATORS OF DECREASING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE VALUES REMAIN STRONG IN OUR MARKETS AND NATIONALLY, WITH MANY MARKETS, INCLUDING DENVER, HITTING NEW POST-CRISIS HIGHS. WE CONTINUE TO SEE OUR MARKETS OUTPERFORMING NATIONAL AVERAGES ON MANY KEY INDICATORS. COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE PROPERTY FUNDAMENTALS ALSO REMAIN STRONG, WITH STABLE OCCUPANCY AND INCREASING LEASE RATES, ALONG WITH CYCLICALLY LOW CAPITALIZATION RATES LEADING TO INCREASING VALUATIONS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO IS SECURED BY REAL ESTATE AND ANY DETERIORATION IN REAL ESTATE VALUES OR CREDIT QUALITY OR ELEVATED LEVELS OF NON-PERFORMING ASSETS WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE QUALITY OF OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO.  \u200b  THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY IS IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF DEPRESSED COMMODITY PRICES. OUR FOOD AND AGRICULTURE PORTFOLIO IS ONLY 5.3% OF TOTAL LOANS AND IS WELL-DIVERSIFIED ACROSS FOOD PRODUCTION, CROP AND LIVESTOCK TYPES. CROP AND LIVESTOCK LOANS REPRESENT 1.4% OF TOTAL LOANS. WE HAVE MAINTAINED RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOOD AND AGRICULTURE CLIENTS THAT GENERALLY POSSESS LOW LEVERAGE AND, CORRESPONDINGLY, LOW BANK DEBT TO ASSETS, MINIMIZING ANY POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.  \u200b  OUR ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS OUTSTANDING PORTFOLIO AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 TOTALED $4.3 BILLION, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $323.3 MILLION, OR 10.7% ANNUALIZED, COMPARED TO DECEMBER 31, 2018. OUR 310-30 LOANS HAVE PRODUCED HIGHER YIELDS THAN OUR ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS, DUE TO ACCRETION OF FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE RATE ON NEW LOANS FUNDED AT THE TIME OF ORIGINATION WAS 5.05% (FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT), COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WEIGHTED AVERAGE YIELD OF OUR ORIGINATED LOAN PORTFOLIO OF 4.84% (FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT). FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT NET INTEREST INCOME REACHED AN INFLECTION POINT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017 AND CONTINUED THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AS THE YIELDS AND VOLUMES OF ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS OUTPACED THE DECREASE IN HIGHER YIELDING 310-30 LOAN BALANCES. THE INFLECTION POINT WAS DRIVEN BY STRONG NEW LOAN ORIGINATIONS. FUTURE GROWTH IN OUR INTEREST INCOME WILL ULTIMATELY BE DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT VOLUMES OF HIGH-QUALITY ORIGINATED LOANS AND FED INTEREST RATE POLICY DECISIONS.  \u200b  CONTINUED REGULATION, IMPENDING NEW LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL CONSTRAINTS, AND A CONTINUAL NEED TO BOLSTER CYBERSECURITY ARE ADDING COSTS AND UNCERTAINTY TO ALL U.S. BANKS AND COULD AFFECT PROFITABILITY. ALSO, NONTRADITIONAL PARTICIPANTS IN THE MARKET MAY OFFER INCREASED COMPETITION AS NON-BANK PAYMENT BUSINESSES, INCLUDING FINTECHS, ARE EXPANDING INTO TRADITIONAL BANKING PRODUCTS.

ACCORDINGLY, FOR THE ORIGINATION OF LOANS, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A CREDIT POLICY THAT ALLOWS FOR RESPONSIVE, YET CONTROLLED LENDING WITH CREDIT APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SCALED TO LOAN SIZE. WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE CREDIT POLICY, EACH PROSPECTIVE LOAN IS REVIEWED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATENESS AND THE ADEQUACY OF THE LOAN CHARACTERISTICS AND THE SECURITY OR COLLATERAL PRIOR TO MAKING A LOAN. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND LOAN ORIGINATION PROCEDURES THAT REQUIRE APPROPRIATE DOCUMENTATION, INCLUDING FINANCIAL DATA AND CREDIT REPORTS. FOR LOANS SECURED BY REAL PROPERTY, WE REQUIRE PROPERTY APPRAISALS, TITLE INSURANCE OR A TITLE OPINION, HAZARD INSURANCE AND FLOOD INSURANCE, IN EACH CASE WHERE APPROPRIATE.  \u200b  ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES TO TIMELY IDENTIFY LOANS THAT MAY BECOME PROBLEMATIC IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE MOST BENEFICIAL RESOLUTION TO THE COMPANY. ASSET QUALITY IS MONITORED BY OUR CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT AND EVALUATED BASED ON QUANTITATIVE AND SUBJECTIVE FACTORS SUCH AS THE TIMELINESS OF CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RECEIVED. ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT ARE CONSIDERED, PARTICULARLY WITH COMMERCIAL LOANS OVER $500,000, INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY OF INDIVIDUAL BORROWERS AND GUARANTORS, IF ANY, AND THE VALUE OF OUR COLLATERAL. TO FACILITATE THE OVERSIGHT OF ASSET QUALITY, LOANS ARE CATEGORIZED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF DAYS PAST DUE AND ON AN INTERNAL RISK RATING SYSTEM, AND BOTH ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  \u200b  IN THE EVENT OF BORROWER DEFAULT, WE MAY SEEK RECOVERY IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LENDING LAWS, THE RESPECTIVE LOAN AGREEMENTS, AND CREDIT MONITORING AND REMEDIATION PROCEDURES THAT MAY INCLUDE MODIFYING OR RESTRUCTURING A LOAN FROM ITS ORIGINAL TERMS, FOR ECONOMIC OR LEGAL REASONS, TO PROVIDE A CONCESSION TO THE BORROWER FROM THEIR ORIGINAL TERMS DUE TO BORROWER FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES IN ORDER TO FACILITATE REPAYMENT. SUCH RESTRUCTURED LOANS ARE CONSIDERED TDRS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 310-40,  TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS BY CREDITORS  . UNDER THIS GUIDANCE, MODIFICATIONS TO LOANS THAT FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ASC 310-30 ARE NOT CONSIDERED TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS, REGARDLESS OF OTHERWISE MEETING THE DEFINITION OF A TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING. ASSETS THAT HAVE BEEN FORECLOSED ON OR ACQUIRED THROUGH DEED-IN-LIEU OF FORECLOSURE ARE CLASSIFIED AS OREO UNTIL SOLD, AND ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF THE RELATED LOAN BALANCE OR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL LESS ESTIMATED COSTS TO SELL, WITH ANY INITIAL VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS CHARGED TO THE ALL AND ANY SUBSEQUENT DECLINES IN CARRYING VALUE CHARGED TO IMPAIRMENTS ON OREO.  \u200b  NON-PERFORMING ASSETS AND PAST DUE LOANS  \u200b  NON-PERFORMING ASSETS CONSIST OF NON-ACCRUAL LOANS, TDRS ON NON-ACCRUAL AND OREO.

INTEREST INCOME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED HAD NON-ACCRUAL LOANS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR ORIGINAL CONTRACT TERMS DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $0.3 MILLION AND $1.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND $0.3 MILLION AND $1.0 MILLION DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  \u200b  ALL LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER ASC 310-30 WERE CLASSIFIED AS PERFORMING ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON THE LOAN POOLS WERE CONSIDERED ESTIMABLE. WHILE INDIVIDUAL LOANS MAKING UP THE POOLS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR ON A COST RECOVERY BASIS, THE CASH FLOWS ON THE LOAN POOLS ARE CONSIDERED ESTIMABLE AND, THEREFORE, INTEREST INCOME, THROUGH ACCRETION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE LOANS IN THE POOL AND THE POOL'S EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, IS BEING RECOGNIZED ON ALL ACQUIRED LOAN POOLS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER ASC 310-30.  \u200b  PAST DUE STATUS IS MONITORED AS AN INDICATOR OF CREDIT DETERIORATION.

DETERMINATION OF THE ALL IS BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF THE COLLECTABILITY OF LOANS, THE REALIZABLE VALUE OF UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, HISTORICAL NET LOAN LOSSES, THE ESTIMATED LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD, ESTIMATED DEFAULT RATES, ANY DECLINES IN CASH FLOW ASSUMPTIONS FROM ACQUISITION, LOAN STRUCTURES, GROWTH FACTORS AND OTHER ELEMENTS THAT WARRANT RECOGNITION AND, TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, PRIOR LOSS EXPERIENCE. THE ALL IS CRITICAL TO THE PORTRAYAL AND UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE DETERMINATION AND APPLICATION OF THE ALL ACCOUNTING POLICY INVOLVES JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. CHANGES IN THESE ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES OR THE CONDITIONS SURROUNDING THEM MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u200b  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE GUIDANCE FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, ACQUIRED LOANS WERE RECORDED AT THEIR ACQUISITION DATE FAIR VALUES, WHICH WERE BASED ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND INCLUDED AN ESTIMATE FOR FUTURE LOAN LOSSES; THEREFORE, NO ALL WAS RECORDED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. ANY ESTIMATED LOSSES ON ACQUIRED LOANS THAT ARISE AFTER THE ACQUISITION DATE ARE REFLECTED IN A CHARGE TO THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u200b  ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED ALL  \u200b  FOR ALL ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS, THE DETERMINATION OF THE ALL FOLLOWS A PROCESS TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ALL THAT IS DESIGNED TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES IN CREDIT QUALITY AND OTHER RISK FACTORS. THIS PROCESS PROVIDES AN ALL CONSISTING OF A SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE COMPONENT BASED ON CERTAIN INDIVIDUALLY EVALUATED LOANS AND A GENERAL ALLOWANCE COMPONENT BASED ON ESTIMATES OF RESERVES NEEDED FOR ALL OTHER LOANS, SEGMENTED BASED ON SIMILAR RISK CHARACTERISTICS.  \u200b  57  \u200b  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPAIRED LOANS LESS THAN $250,000 ARE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL ALLOWANCE POPULATION. IMPAIRED LOANS OVER $250,000 ARE SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL EVALUATION ON A REGULAR BASIS TO DETERMINE THE NEED, IF ANY, TO ALLOCATE A SPECIFIC RESERVE TO THE IMPAIRED LOAN. TYPICALLY, THESE LOANS CONSIST OF COMMERCIAL, COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AND FOOD AND AGRICULTURE LOANS AND EXCLUDE HOMOGENEOUS LOANS SUCH AS RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE AND CONSUMER LOANS. SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES ARE DETERMINED BY COLLECTIVELY ANALYZING.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u25cf  THE BORROWER'S RESOURCES, ABILITY, AND WILLINGNESS TO REPAY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT;  \u25cf  THE LIKELIHOOD OF RECEIVING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM ANY GUARANTORS;  \u25cf  THE ADEQUACY AND PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, LESS DISPOSAL COSTS, OF ANY COLLATERAL; AND  \u25cf  THE IMPACT CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY HAVE ON THE BORROWER'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY OR THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL.  \u200b  IN EVALUATING THE LOAN PORTFOLIO FOR AN APPROPRIATE ALL LEVEL, UNIMPAIRED LOANS ARE GROUPED INTO SEGMENTS BASED ON BROAD CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS PRIMARY USE AND UNDERLYING COLLATERAL. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED FOUR PRIMARY LOAN SEGMENTS THAT ARE FURTHER STRATIFIED INTO 11 LOAN CLASSES TO PROVIDE MORE GRANULARITY IN ANALYZING LOSS HISTORY AND TO ALLOW FOR MORE DEFINITIVE QUALITATIVE ADJUSTMENTS BASED UPON SPECIFIC FACTORS AFFECTING EACH LOAN CLASS. FOLLOWING ARE THE LOAN CLASSES WITHIN EACH OF THE FOUR PRIMARY LOAN SEGMENTS.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  NON-OWNER OCCUPIED  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  COMMERCIAL  \u200b  COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE  \u200b  RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE  \u200b  CONSUMER  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL  \u200b  CONSTRUCTION  \u200b  SENIOR LIEN  \u200b  TOTAL CONSUMER  OWNER OCCUPIED COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE  \u200b  ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT  \u200b  JUNIOR LIEN  \u200b  \u200b  FOOD AND AGRICULTURE  \u200b  MULTIFAMILY  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  ENERGY  \u200b  NON-OWNER OCCUPIED  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  APPROPRIATE ALL LEVELS ARE DETERMINED BY SEGMENT AND CLASS UTILIZING RISK RATINGS, LOSS HISTORY, PEER LOSS HISTORY AND QUALITATIVE ADJUSTMENTS. THE QUALITATIVE ADJUSTMENTS CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u25cf  ECONOMIC/EXTERNAL CONDITIONS;  \u25cf  LOAN ADMINISTRATION, LOAN STRUCTURE AND PROCEDURES;  \u25cf  RISK TOLERANCE/EXPERIENCE;  \u25cf  LOAN GROWTH;  \u25cf  TRENDS;  \u25cf  CONCENTRATIONS; AND  \u25cf  \u200b  OTHER.  \u200b  MANAGEMENT DERIVES AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL LOSS RATE ADJUSTED FOR AN ESTIMATED LOSS EMERGENCE PERIOD BASED ON HISTORICAL LOSS DATA CATEGORIZED BY SEGMENT AND CLASS. THE LOSS RATES ARE APPLIED AT THE LOAN SEGMENT AND CLASS LEVEL. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS OUR LACK OF HISTORICAL LOSS DATA ENCOMPASSING A FULL ECONOMIC CYCLE, WE INCORPORATE NOT ONLY OUR OWN HISTORICAL LOSS RATES SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2012, BUT WE ALSO UTILIZE PEER HISTORICAL LOSS DATA, INCLUDING A HISTORICAL AVERAGE NET CHARGE-OFF RATIO ON EACH LOAN TYPE, RELYING ON THE UNIFORM BANK PERFORMANCE REPORTS COMPILED BY THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATIONS COUNCIL (\u201cFFIEC\u201d). FOR ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS, WE ASSIGN A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PORTION OF OUR LOSS HISTORY, BUT STILL RELY ON THE PEER LOSS HISTORY TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR LIMITED HISTORICAL DATA.  \u200b  THE COLLECTIVE RESULTING ALL FOR ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS IS CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF THE SPECIFIC RESERVES AND THE GENERAL RESERVES. WHILE THESE AMOUNTS ARE CALCULATED BY INDIVIDUAL LOAN OR SEGMENT AND CLASS, THE ENTIRE ALL IS AVAILABLE FOR ANY LOAN THAT, IN OUR JUDGMENT, SHOULD BE CHARGED-OFF.  \u200b  PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES OF $5.7 MILLION AND $10.5 MILLION WAS RECORDED DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, TO SUPPORT ORIGINATED LOAN GROWTH AND NET CHARGE-OFFS. INCLUDED IN PROVISION EXPENSE DURING THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS WAS $4.2 MILLION AND $6.6 MILLION RELATED TO ONE PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED COMMERCIAL LOAN THAT WAS PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. NET CHARGE-OFFS DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 TOTALED $7.1 MILLION, OR 0.66% ANNUALIZED, AND $7.4 MILLION, OR 0.24% ANNUALIZED, RESPECTIVELY, AND INCLUDED $6.6 MILLION RELATED TO THE LOAN DESCRIBED ABOVE. SPECIFIC RESERVES ON IMPAIRED LOANS TOTALED $1.8 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  \u200b  DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, $0.8 MILLION AND $2.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS RECORDED FOR GENERAL RESERVES ON LOAN GROWTH. NET RECOVERIES FOR ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS DURING THE  58  \u200b  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 TOTALED $0.8 MILLION, AND NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR ORIGINATED AND ACQUIRED LOANS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 TOTALED $0.2 MILLION, OR 0.01% ANNUALIZED. SPECIFIC RESERVES ON IMPAIRED LOANS TOTALED $1.5 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  \u200b  310-30 ALL  \u200b  LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN ASC 310-30 HAVE BEEN GROUPED INTO POOLS BASED ON THE PREDOMINANT RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF PURPOSE AND/OR TYPE OF LOAN. THE TIMING AND RECEIPT OF EXPECTED PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND ANY OTHER CASH FLOWS OF THESE LOANS ARE PERIODICALLY REMEASURED AND THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE COLLECTIVE POOLS ARE COMPARED TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE POOLS. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH POOL IS LESS THAN THE BOOK VALUE OF THE POOL, AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES WILL BE ESTABLISHED THROUGH A CHARGE TO THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. IF THE REMEASURED EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE GREATER THAN THE BOOK VALUE OF THE POOLS, THEN THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS IS ACCRETED INTO INTEREST INCOME OVER THE REMAINING EXPECTED LIFE OF THE LOAN POOL. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, THESE REMEASUREMENTS RESULTED IN OVERALL INCREASES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS IN CERTAIN LOAN POOLS, WHICH, ABSENT PREVIOUS VALUATION ALLOWANCES WITHIN THE SAME POOL, ARE REFLECTED IN INCREASED ACCRETION AS WELL AS AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF ACCRETABLE YIELD AND ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE EXPECTED REMAINING LIVES OF THE UNDERLYING LOANS AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO YIELD.  \u200b  DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER ASC 310-30 HAD RECOUPMENT OF $11 THOUSAND AND $51 THOUSAND, RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER ASC 310-30 HAD $6 THOUSAND AND $197 THOUSAND OF PROVISION, RESPECTIVELY.  \u200b  TOTAL ALL  \u200b  AFTER CONSIDERING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED FACTORS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE ALL OF $38.7 MILLION IS ADEQUATE TO COVER PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. HOWEVER, IT IS LIKELY THAT FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ALL WILL BE NECESSARY AND ANY CHANGES TO THE ASSUMPTIONS, CIRCUMSTANCES OR ESTIMATES USED IN DETERMINING THE ALL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY GAINS ON THE SALE OF OREO PROPERTIES TOTALING $6.5 MILLION DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RESIDENTIAL BANKING COMMISSIONS DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD.  \u200b  NON-INTEREST EXPENSE TOTALED $134.6 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $146.5 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, REPRESENTING A DECREASE OF $11.8 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NET GAINS ON THE SALE OF OREO PROPERTIES TOTALING $7.2 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RESIDENTIAL BANKING COMMISSIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018 INCLUDED $8.0 MILLION OF NON-RECURRING ACQUISITION COSTS.  \u200b  AS PART OF OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON IMPROVING OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND INVESTING IN DIGITAL SOLUTIONS FOR OUR CLIENTS, THE COMPANY PLANS TO CONSOLIDATE FOUR BANKING CENTERS IN THE COLORADO AND KANSAS CITY MARKETS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. A FAIR VALUE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $0.9 MILLION WAS RECORDED TO OTHER NON-INTEREST EXPENSE DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 RELATED TO THE PLANNED CONSOLIDATIONS, WITH AN EXPECTED EARN BACK OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR.  \u200b  INCOME TAXES  \u200b  INCOME TAX EXPENSE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $5.4 MILLION AND $12.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO $4.4 MILLION AND $8.8 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE TAX EXPENSE RECORDED FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS LOWERED BY A $2.2 MILLION TAX BENEFIT FROM STOCK COMPENSATION ACTIVITY. THE TAX EXPENSE RECORDED FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 WAS LOWERED BY A $0.1 MILLION AND $1.3 MILLION TAX BENEFIT FROM STOCK COMPENSATION ACTIVITY, RESPECTIVELY. ADJUSTING FOR THE STOCK COMPENSATION ACTIVITY, THE TAX RATES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE 20.0% AND 19.4%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 19.8% AND 19.1% FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DIFFERS FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK COMPENSATION ACTIVITY, INTEREST INCOME FROM TAX-EXEMPT LENDING, BANK-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE INCOME, AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF THESE ITEMS TO PRE-TAX INCOME. THE COMPANY FORECASTS THE FULL YEAR ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 740. AS A RESULT, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRE-TAX INCOME AND TAX-EXEMPT INCOME WITHIN EACH REPORTING PERIOD CAN CREATE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD.  \u200b  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING INCOME TAXES CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 20 OF OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON  FORM 10-K.  \u200b  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  \u200b  LIQUIDITY IS MONITORED AND MANAGED TO ENSURE THAT SUFFICIENT FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS AND PAY OUR OBLIGATIONS TO DEPOSITORS AND OTHER CREDITORS, WHILE PROVIDING AMPLE AVAILABLE FUNDS FOR OPPORTUNISTIC AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS.

THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO LOWER UNENCUMBERED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES OF $254.0 MILLION PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS OF $7.4 MILLION.  \u200b  THROUGH OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FHLB, WE HAVE PLEDGED QUALIFYING LOANS AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES ALLOWING US TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY THROUGH FHLB ADVANCES AND LINES OF CREDIT. THE BANK HAD LOANS PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL FOR FHLB ADVANCES OF $1.5 BILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND $1.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. FHLB ADVANCES, LINES OF CREDIT AND OTHER SHORT-TERM BORROWING AVAILABILITY TOTALED $1.0 BILLION, OF WHICH $303.9 MILLION WAS USED AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. WE CAN OBTAIN ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY THROUGH FHLB ADVANCES IF REQUIRED. THE BANK ALSO HAS ACCESS TO FEDERAL FUNDS LINES OF CREDIT WITH CORRESPONDENT BANKS.  \u200b  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF FUNDS ARE DEPOSITS, SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE, PREPAYMENTS AND MATURITIES OF LOANS AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES, THE SALE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND FUNDS PROVIDED FROM OPERATIONS. WE ANTICIPATE HAVING ACCESS TO OTHER THIRD PARTY FUNDING SOURCES, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO RAISE FUNDS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK OR OTHER EQUITY OR EQUITY-RELATED SECURITIES, INCURRENCE OF DEBT AND FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED, THAT MAY ALSO BE A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THESE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL PROVIDE ADEQUATE FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY FOR AT LEAST A 12-MONTH PERIOD.  \u200b  OUR PRIMARY USES OF FUNDS ARE LOAN ORIGINATIONS, INVESTMENT SECURITY PURCHASES, WITHDRAWALS OF DEPOSITS, SETTLEMENT OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, OPERATING EXPENSES AND SHARE REPURCHASES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING CASH FLOWS, SEE OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS IN THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u200b  EXCLUSIVE FROM THE INVESTING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS, OUR PRIMARY INVESTING ACTIVITIES ARE ORIGINATIONS AND PAY-OFFS AND PAYDOWNS OF LOANS AND PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, PLEDGEABLE INVESTMENT SECURITIES REPRESENTED A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE AND OUR HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT AMORTIZED COST. OUR COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO TOTALED $0.9 BILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCLUSIVE OF PRE-TAX NET UNREALIZED GAINS OF $1.3 MILLION ON THE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND $0.7 MILLION OF PRE-TAX NET UNREALIZED GAINS ON OUR HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THE GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE DETAILED IN NOTE 3 OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, ALL OF WHICH WERE ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR SPONSORED ENTERPRISES. THE ANTICIPATED REPAYMENTS AND MARKETABILITY OF THESE SECURITIES OFFER SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND FLEXIBILITY TO MEET NEW LOAN DEMAND, REINVEST IN THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, OR PROVIDE OPTIONALITY FOR REDUCTIONS IN OUR DEPOSIT FUNDING BASE.  \u200b  AT PRESENT, FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF CHANGES IN DEPOSITS AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND ADVANCES FROM THE FHLB, IN ADDITION TO THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND THE REPURCHASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. MATURING TIME DEPOSITS REPRESENT A POTENTIAL USE OF FUNDS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, $731.1 MILLION OF TIME DEPOSITS WERE SCHEDULED TO MATURE WITHIN 12 MONTHS. BASED ON THE CURRENT INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUR CONSUMER BANKING STRATEGY FOCUSING ON BOTH LOWER COST TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS AND TERM DEPOSITS, OUR STRATEGY IS TO REPLACE A PORTION OF THOSE MATURING TIME DEPOSITS WITH TRANSACTION DEPOSITS AND MARKET-RATE TIME DEPOSITS.  \u200b  UNDER THE BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY AND THE BANK MET ALL CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS AND THE BANK HAD REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS IN EXCESS OF THE LEVELS ESTABLISHED FOR WELL-CAPITALIZED INSTITUTIONS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON REGULATORY CAPITAL, SEE NOTE 10 IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u200b  OUR SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY IS IMPACTED BY EARNINGS, CHANGES IN UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON SECURITIES, NET OF TAX, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ACTIVITY, SHARE REPURCHASES AND THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.  \u200b  70  \u200b  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS AUTHORIZED MULTIPLE PROGRAMS TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME EITHER IN OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE REGULATIONS OF THE SEC. ON AUGUST 5, 2016, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $50.0 MILLION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK. THE REMAINING AUTHORIZATION UNDER THIS PROGRAM AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $12.6 MILLION. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  \u200b  ON NOVEMBER 6, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.20 PER COMMON SHARE, PAYABLE ON DECEMBER 13, 2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON NOVEMBER 29, 2019.  \u200b  ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT AND INTEREST RATE RISK  \u200b  MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING INTEREST RATE RISK AND EMPLOYING RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES THAT MONITOR AND LIMIT THIS EXPOSURE. INTEREST RATE RISK IS MEASURED USING NET INTEREST INCOME SIMULATIONS AND MARKET VALUE OF PORTFOLIO EQUITY ANALYSES. THESE ANALYSES USE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THE NATURE AND TIMING OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, YIELD CURVE SHAPE, PREPAYMENTS ON LOANS AND SECURITIES, DEPOSIT DECAY RATES, PRICING DECISIONS ON LOANS AND DEPOSITS AND REINVESTMENT/REPLACEMENT OF ASSET AND LIABILITY CASH FLOWS.  \u200b  THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVE OF THE COMPANY'S ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT FUNCTION IS TO EVALUATE THE INTEREST RATE RISK WITHIN THE BALANCE SHEET AND PURSUE A CONTROLLED ASSUMPTION OF INTEREST RATE RISK WHILE MAXIMIZING EARNINGS AND PRESERVING ADEQUATE LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL. THE ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT FUNCTION IS UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE ASSET LIABILITY COMMITTEE FROM DIRECTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE ASSET LIABILITY COMMITTEE MEETS MONTHLY TO REVIEW, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SENSITIVITY OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES, LOCAL AND NATIONAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND RATES. THE ASSET LIABILITY COMMITTEE ALSO REVIEWS THE LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL, DEPOSIT MIX, LOAN MIX AND INVESTMENT POSITIONS OF THE COMPANY.  \u200b  INSTANTANEOUS PARALLEL RATE SHIFT SCENARIOS ARE MODELED AND UTILIZED TO EVALUATE RISK AND ESTABLISH EXPOSURE LIMITS FOR ACCEPTABLE CHANGES IN NET INTEREST MARGIN. THESE SCENARIOS, KNOWN AS RATE SHOCKS, SIMULATE AN INSTANTANEOUS CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES AND USE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PREPAYMENTS ON LOANS AND SECURITIES, DEPOSIT DECAY RATES, PRICING DECISIONS ON LOANS AND DEPOSITS, REINVESTMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF ASSET AND LIABILITY CASH FLOWS.  \u200b  WE ALSO ANALYZE THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY AS A SECONDARY MEASURE OF INTEREST RATE RISK. THIS IS A COMPLEMENTARY MEASURE TO NET INTEREST INCOME WHERE THE CALCULATED VALUE IS THE RESULT OF THE MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS LESS THE MARKET VALUE OF LIABILITIES. THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY IS A LONGER TERM VIEW OF INTEREST RATE RISK BECAUSE IT MEASURES THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS. THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ON THIS CALCULATION IS ANALYZED FOR THE RISK TO OUR FUTURE EARNINGS AND IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ANALYSES ON NET INTEREST INCOME.  \u200b  OUR INTEREST RATE RISK MODEL INDICATED THAT THE COMPANY WAS ASSET SENSITIVE IN TERMS OF INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE DECREASED OUR ASSET SENSITIVITY IN A DECLINING RATE ENVIRONMENT AS A RESULT OF THE BALANCE SHEET MIX TOWARD MORE FIXED RATE ASSETS. THE TABLE BELOW ILLUSTRATES THE IMPACT OF AN IMMEDIATE AND SUSTAINED 200 AND 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE AND A 100 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES ON NET INTEREST INCOME BASED ON THE INTEREST RATE RISK MODEL AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  HYPOTHETICAL  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  SHIFT IN INTEREST  \u200b% CHANGE IN PROJECTED NET INTEREST INCOME  RATES (IN BPS)  \u200b  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  DECEMBER 31, 2018  200  \u200b  5.96%  \u200b  5.86%  100  \u200b  3.05%  \u200b  2.98%  (100)  \u200b  (4.13)%  \u200b  (4.84)%  \u200b  MANY ASSUMPTIONS ARE USED TO CALCULATE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN OUR PROJECTIONS DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE TIMING AND FREQUENCY OF RATE CHANGES, MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE SHAPE OF THE YIELD CURVE. THE COMPUTATIONS OF INTEREST RATE RISK SHOWN ABOVE DO NOT INCLUDE ACTIONS THAT MANAGEMENT MAY UNDERTAKE TO MANAGE THE RISKS IN RESPONSE TO ANTICIPATED CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND ACTUAL RESULTS MAY ALSO DIFFER DUE TO ANY ACTIONS TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THE CHANGING RATES.  \u200b  AS PART OF THE ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY TO MANAGE PRIMARY MARKET RISK EXPOSURES EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS, MANAGEMENT HAS EMPHASIZED THE ORIGINATION OF LONGER DURATION LOANS. THE STRATEGY WITH RESPECT TO LIABILITIES HAS BEEN TO  71  \u200b  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONTINUE TO EMPHASIZE TRANSACTION ACCOUNT GROWTH, PARTICULARLY NON-INTEREST OR LOW INTEREST BEARING NON-MATURING DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. NON-MATURING DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS HAVE GROWN $211.5 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AND IMPROVED TO 77.5% OF TOTAL DEPOSITS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 76.2% AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO BROKERED TIME DEPOSITS.  \u200b  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ACTIVITIES  \u200b  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ARE A PARTY TO VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ACTIVITIES THAT CONTAIN CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISK THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE ARE THE LOAN COMMITMENTS THAT WE ENTER INTO TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF CLIENTS, INCLUDING COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT, COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER LINES OF CREDIT AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAD LOAN COMMITMENTS TOTALING $801.1 MILLION AND $773.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT THAT TOTALED $11.7 MILLION AND $10.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. UNUSED COMMITMENTS DO NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT FUTURE CREDIT EXPOSURE OR CASH REQUIREMENTS, AS COMMITMENTS OFTEN EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING DRAWN UPON. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL LOSSES ARISING FROM COMMITMENTS OR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ANY MATERIAL COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT THAT REPRESENT RISKS OF AN UNUSUAL NATURE.  \u200b", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "National Bank Holdings Corp", "CIK": 1475841, "Date": "2019-11-06T00:00:00", "Ticker": "NBHC", "Name": "National Bank Holdings Corp", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 6021.0, "Business": "CO", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 270563799.0, "key": "20191106NBHC", "labelr1": 0.5913827090960317, "labelr2": -0.11198208286673894, "labelr3": -0.4204035874439422, "labelr4": -0.3095975232198126, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.1324192, "prof1": 0.86758083, "return1&2": 1.0047873838355392, "return1&2&3": 1.0005632216277105, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9974655026753028, "return2": 0.9988801791713326, "return1": 1.0059138270909602, "return3": 0.9957959641255606, "return4": 0.9969040247678018, "1_day_return": 0.5913827090960222, "cumulative_return1": 0.0012000101657537654, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.0005676630111315363, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 1.233981089064405e-05, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1.109968519591525e-05, "indexx": 3037, "cumreturn1b": 0.6848700156301591, "cumreturndow": 1.0059571427020124, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0119734194994836}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3157, "level_0": 6535, "index": 92958, "text": "ITEM 2.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  , WE REVIEWED AND REALIGNED OUR REPORTING SEGMENTS TO REFLECT HOW THE BUSINESS WILL BE MANAGED AND THE RESULTS WILL BE REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, WHO IS THE COMPANY\u2019S CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER. FOLLOWING SUCH REVIEW, WE REALIGNED OUR THREE REPORTING SEGMENTS AS FOLLOWS: ROUTE BASED SERVICES (WHICH INCLUDES OUR DS SERVICES OF AMERICA, INC. (\u201cDSS\u201d), AQUATERRA CORPORATION (\u201cAQUATERRA\u201d), MOUNTAIN VALLEY SPRING COMPANY (\u201cMOUNTAIN VALLEY\u201d), EDEN SPRINGS EUROPE B.V.

(\u201cS&D\u201d) BUSINESS); AND ALL OTHER (WHICH INCLUDES MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES AND OUR COTT BEVERAGES LLC BUSINESS, WHICH WAS SOLD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019). OUR SEGMENT REPORTING RESULTS HAVE BEEN RECAST TO REFLECT THESE CHANGES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  DIVESTITURE TRANSACTION  ON FEBRUARY 8, 2019, WE SOLD ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY OF COTT BEVERAGES LLC, WHICH OPERATED OUR SOFT DRINK CONCENTRATE PRODUCTION BUSINESS AND OUR ROYAL CROWN INTERNATIONAL (\u201cRCI\u201d) DIVISION, TO REFRESCO GROUP B.V., A DUTCH BEVERAGE MANUFACTURER (\u201cREFRESCO\u201d). THE AGGREGATE DEAL CONSIDERATION PAID AT CLOSING WAS  $50.0 MILLION  , SUBJECT TO POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, INDEBTEDNESS AND OTHER CUSTOMARY ITEMS. THE SALE OF COTT BEVERAGES LLC RESULTED IN A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY  $6.0 MILLION  THAT WAS RECORDED TO OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 28, 2019. WE USED THE PROCEEDS OF THIS TRANSACTION TO REPAY A PORTION OF THE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR ASSET-BASED LENDING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cABL FACILITY\u201d).  31  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  IN ADDITION TO HISTORICAL INFORMATION, THIS REPORT, AND ANY DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED IN THIS REPORT BY REFERENCE, MAY CONTAIN STATEMENTS RELATING TO FUTURE EVENTS AND FUTURE RESULTS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING\u201d WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND APPLICABLE CANADIAN SECURITIES LEGISLATION AND INVOLVE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, FUTURE EXPECTATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS OF COTT CORPORATION TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY FUTURE RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH STATEMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, STATEMENTS THAT RELATE TO PROJECTIONS OF SALES, CASH FLOWS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OTHER FINANCIAL ITEMS, STATEMENTS REGARDING OUR INTENTIONS TO PAY REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON SHARES, AND DISCUSSIONS OF ESTIMATED FUTURE REVENUE ENHANCEMENTS AND COST SAVINGS. THESE STATEMENTS ALSO RELATE TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS CONCERNING OUR MARKET POSITION, FUTURE OPERATIONS, MARGINS, PROFITABILITY, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. GENERALLY, WORDS SUCH AS \u201cANTICIPATE,\u201d \u201cBELIEVE,\u201d \u201cCONTINUE,\u201d \u201cCOULD,\u201d \u201cENDEAVOR,\u201d \u201cESTIMATE,\u201d \u201cEXPECT,\u201d \u201cINTEND,\u201d \u201cMAY,\u201d \u201cWILL,\u201d \u201cPLAN,\u201d \u201cPREDICT,\u201d \u201cPROJECT,\u201d \u201cSHOULD\u201d AND SIMILAR TERMS AND PHRASES ARE USED TO IDENTIFY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT AND ANY DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED IN THIS REPORT BY REFERENCE. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REFLECT CURRENT EXPECTATIONS REGARDING FUTURE EVENTS AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND ARE MADE ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT.  THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEES OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR EVENTS AND, BY THEIR NATURE, ARE BASED ON CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING INTEREST AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, EXPECTED GROWTH, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, PERFORMANCE, BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND OPPORTUNITIES AND EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. MATERIAL FACTORS OR ASSUMPTIONS THAT WERE APPLIED IN DRAWING A CONCLUSION OR MAKING AN ESTIMATE SET OUT IN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING MANAGEMENT\u2019S CURRENT PLANS AND ESTIMATES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE REASONABLE, ANY OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS COULD PROVE TO BE INACCURATE AND, AS A RESULT, THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BASED ON THOSE ASSUMPTIONS COULD PROVE TO BE INCORRECT. OUR OPERATIONS INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, AND ANY ONE OR ANY COMBINATION OF THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES COULD ALSO AFFECT WHETHER THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ULTIMATELY PROVE TO BE CORRECT. THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE DESCRIBED IN PART I, ITEM 1A. \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT, AND THOSE DESCRIBED FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR FUTURE REPORTS FILED WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) AND CANADIAN SECURITIES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.  THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, SALES, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS, OR COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ESTIMATES CONTAINED IN OR UNDERLYING THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE;  \u2022  FLUCTUATIONS IN COMMODITY PRICES AND OUR ABILITY TO PASS ON INCREASED COSTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OR HEDGE AGAINST SUCH RISING COSTS, AND THE IMPACT OF THOSE INCREASED PRICES ON OUR VOLUMES;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR OPERATIONS SUCCESSFULLY;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO FULLY REALIZE THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE PURSUE;  \u2022  POTENTIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RECENT DIVESTITURES;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE THE REVENUE AND COST SYNERGIES OF OUR ACQUISITIONS DUE TO INTEGRATION DIFFICULTIES AND OTHER CHALLENGES;  \u2022  OUR EXPOSURE TO INTANGIBLE ASSET RISK;  \u2022  CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND THE BRITISH POUND STERLING, THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE EURO, THE CANADIAN DOLLAR AND OTHER CURRENCIES AND THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE BRITISH POUND STERLING AND THE EURO;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN FAVORABLE ARRANGEMENTS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS, AND RISKS OF FURTHER INCREASES TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS AND CONDITIONS UNDER OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS;  \u2022  FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS;  \u2022  THE INCURRENCE OF SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS TO FINANCE OUR ACQUISITIONS;  \u2022  THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL FINANCIAL EVENTS ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM UNCERTAINTY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OTHER ADVERSE CHANGES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS;  \u2022  ANY DISRUPTION TO PRODUCTION AT OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES;  32  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO OUR WATER SOURCES;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY;  \u2022  COMPLIANCE WITH PRODUCT HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS;  \u2022  LIABILITY FOR INJURY OR ILLNESS CAUSED BY THE CONSUMPTION OF CONTAMINATED PRODUCTS;  \u2022  LIABILITY AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AS A RESULT OF LITIGATION OR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS;  \u2022  CHANGES IN THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE;  \u2022  THE SEASONAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS AND THE EFFECT OF ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS;  \u2022  THE IMPACT OF NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL EVENTS, INCLUDING THOSE OF A POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, BUSINESS AND COMPETITIVE NATURE;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT, RETAIN AND INTEGRATE NEW MANAGEMENT;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO RENEW OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ON SATISFACTORY TERMS;  \u2022  DISRUPTIONS IN OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO SECURELY MAINTAIN OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 CONFIDENTIAL OR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION, OR OTHER PRIVATE DATA RELATING TO OUR EMPLOYEES OR OUR COMPANY;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND ADDRESS DIFFICULTIES IN COMPLYING WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDING THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND THE U.K. BRIBERY ACT OF 2010;  \u2022  INCREASED TAX LIABILITIES IN THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE TAX ATTRIBUTES TO OFFSET FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME;  \u2022  THE IMPACT OF THE 2017 TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ON OUR TAX OBLIGATIONS AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE; OR  \u2022  CREDIT RATING CHANGES.  WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT OR TO PUBLICLY RELEASE THE RESULTS OF ANY REVISIONS TO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS TO REFLECT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH WE MAY BECOME AWARE OF AFTER THE DATE OF THIS REPORT. UNDUE RELIANCE SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, AND ALL FUTURE WRITTEN AND ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO US OR PERSONS ACTING ON OUR BEHALF ARE EXPRESSLY QUALIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BY THE FOREGOING.  NON-GAAP MEASURES  IN THIS REPORT, WE SUPPLEMENT OUR REPORTING OF FINANCIAL MEASURES DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) BY UTILIZING CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT EXCLUDE CERTAIN ITEMS TO MAKE PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD COMPARISONS FOR OUR UNDERLYING OPERATIONS BEFORE MATERIAL CHANGES. WE EXCLUDE THESE ITEMS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS. WE EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO SEPARATE THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES FROM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  WE ALSO UTILIZE EARNINGS (LOSS) BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), WHICH IS GAAP NET INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, EXPENSE FOR INCOME TAXES AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. WE CONSIDER EBITDA TO BE AN INDICATOR OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE. WE ALSO USE EBITDA, AS DO ANALYSTS, LENDERS, INVESTORS AND OTHERS, BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES CERTAIN ITEMS THAT CAN VARY WIDELY ACROSS DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES OR AMONG COMPANIES WITHIN THE SAME INDUSTRY. THESE DIFFERENCES CAN RESULT IN CONSIDERABLE VARIABILITY IN THE RELATIVE COSTS OF PRODUCTIVE ASSETS AND THE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AMONG COMPANIES. WE ALSO UTILIZE ADJUSTED EBITDA, WHICH IS EBITDA EXCLUDING ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS, LOSS ON COMMODITY HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, NET, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND OTHER LOSSES (GAINS), NET, LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET, GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT, LOSS (GAIN) ON SALE OF BUSINESS, OPERATIONS OF COTT BEVERAGES LLC, AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS, NET, AS THE CASE MAY BE (\u201cADJUSTED EBITDA\u201d). WE CONSIDER ADJUSTED EBITDA TO BE AN INDICATOR OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  33  BECAUSE WE USE THESE ADJUSTED FINANCIAL RESULTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS AND TO UNDERSTAND UNDERLYING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, WE BELIEVE THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS FOR THEIR INDEPENDENT EVALUATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR MANAGEMENT. THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT MEANT TO BE CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, OR A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. IN ADDITION, THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT REFLECT OUR JUDGMENT OF PARTICULAR ITEMS, AND MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM, AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO, SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR LEVEL OF RESOURCES, WHICH INCLUDES CASH ON HAND, AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR ABL FACILITY AND FUNDS PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATIONS, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR EXPENSES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH TO MEET OUR CURRENT EXPENSES AND DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS WILL DEPEND ON OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. IF WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH CASH TO PAY OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS, OR IF THE ABL FACILITY OR OUR OUTSTANDING NOTES WERE TO BECOME CURRENTLY DUE, EITHER AT MATURITY OR AS A RESULT OF A BREACH, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO TAKE ACTIONS SUCH AS AMENDING OUR ABL FACILITY OR THE INDENTURES GOVERNING OUR OUTSTANDING NOTES, REFINANCING ALL OR PART OF OUR EXISTING DEBT, SELLING ASSETS, INCURRING ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS OR RAISING EQUITY. THE ABL FACILITY IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS AND THOSE OF THE RESPECTIVE GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES. IF THE ABL FACILITY WERE TO BECOME CURRENTLY DUE, THE LENDERS MAY HAVE THE RIGHT TO FORECLOSE ON SUCH ASSETS. IF WE NEED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FINANCING, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  , OUR TOTAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY WAS  $219.7 MILLION  , WHICH WAS BASED ON OUR BORROWING BASE (ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES, INVENTORY, AND FIXED ASSETS AS OF THE SEPTEMBER  2019  MONTH-END UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT GOVERNING THE ABL FACILITY).

AS A RESULT, OUR EXCESS AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY WAS  $91.4 MILLION  . EACH MONTH\u2019S BORROWING BASE IS NOT EFFECTIVE UNTIL SUBMITTED TO THE LENDERS, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS ON THE FIFTEENTH DAY OF THE FOLLOWING MONTH.  WE EARN A PORTION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME IN SUBSIDIARIES LOCATED OUTSIDE OF CANADA. WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED FOR FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF OUR NON-CANADIAN SUBSIDIARIES. WE EXPECT THAT THESE EARNINGS WILL BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED BY SUCH SUBSIDIARIES EXCEPT IN CERTAIN INSTANCES WHERE REPATRIATION ATTRIBUTABLE TO CURRENT EARNINGS RESULTS IN MINIMAL OR NO TAX CONSEQUENCES.  41  WE EXPECT OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS AND THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH FLOWS OUTSIDE OF CANADA TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.  A FUTURE CHANGE TO OUR ASSERTION THAT FOREIGN EARNINGS WILL BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL INCOME TAXES AND/OR WITHHOLDING TAXES PAYABLE, WHERE APPLICABLE. THEREFORE, A HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD OCCUR DURING THE PERIOD OF REPATRIATION.  WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WHETHER OUR OUTSTANDING NOTES ARE THEN TRADING AT A DISCOUNT TO THEIR FACE AMOUNT, REPURCHASE OUR OUTSTANDING NOTES FOR CASH AND/OR IN EXCHANGE FOR OUR COMMON SHARES, WARRANTS, PREFERRED SHARES, DEBT OR OTHER CONSIDERATION, IN EACH CASE IN OPEN MARKET PURCHASES AND/OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE AMOUNTS INVOLVED IN ANY SUCH TRANSACTIONS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, MAY BE MATERIAL. HOWEVER, THE COVENANTS IN OUR ABL FACILITY SUBJECT SUCH PURCHASES TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND CONDITIONS.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT OFFERS THE LOAN AND DEPOSIT PRODUCTS AND HAS THE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR CONTINUED SUCCESS, FUTURE REVENUES AND INTEREST SPREADS AND YIELDS CANNOT BE RELIABLY PREDICTED. THESE TRENDS MAY CAUSE THE COMPANY TO ADJUST ITS OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE OF THE FOREGOING AND OTHER FACTORS, RECENT TRENDS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED RELIABLE INDICATORS OF FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS OR STOCK PRICES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND TO DISCLOSE CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. MANAGEMENT HAS IDENTIFIED THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES, THE ANALYSIS AND VALUATION OF ITS INVESTMENT SECURITIES, THE VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND THE VALUATION OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH ITS BUSINESS COMBINATION, AS THE COMPANY\u2019S MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES IN THAT THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT\u2019S MOST SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENT AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. REFER TO THE 2018 FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  44  SUMMARY  THE COMPANY REPORTED NET INCOME FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 OF $27,000 ($0.01 BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) COMPARED TO A NET INCOME OF $769,000 ($0.20 BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. THE INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $35,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO $1.0 MILLION INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $1.3 MILLION ($0.33 BASIC AND DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE) COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF $2.9 MILLION ($0.74 BASIC AND $0.73 DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE) FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, A DECREASE OF $4.2 MILLION. THE DECLINE IN 2019 RESULTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A MATERIAL INCREASE IN PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES TO $2.9 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND $3.2 MILLION IN THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH A $2.3 MILLION CHARGE-OFF ON A SINGLE COMMERCIAL LOAN.  THE RESULTS OF THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE ALSO IMPACTED BY A DECLINE IN NET INTEREST INCOME DUE TO HIGHER RETAIL DEPOSIT COSTS, A HIGHER BALANCE OF NON-ACCRUAL LOANS AND THE FULL YEAR IMPACT OF SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED IN JUNE 2018. THE COMPARISON TO THE PRIOR YEAR WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY AN INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES. THE EXPENSE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUILD-UP OF OUR SBA BUSINESS, EXPANSION OF DEPOSIT INITIATIVES, AND COSTS INCURRED IN CONJUNCTION WITH ENHANCING PROCESSES, CONTROLS AND DOCUMENTATION IN RESPONSE TO THE FORMAL AGREEMENT WITH THE OCC.  AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, ON MARCH 30, 2019, THE COMPANY AND HANA SMALL BUSINESS LENDING INC. MUTUALLY AGREED TO TERMINATE THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES ENTERED INTO IN NOVEMBER 2018. THE TERMINATION AGREEMENT PROVIDED FOR THE RELEASE OF ESCROWED FUNDS BACK TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY RECEIVED THE ESCROWED FUNDS OF $500,000 ON MAY 9, 2019.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS OPERATING RESULTS TO BUILD BACK UP IN FUTURE PERIODS AS IT BEGINS TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS IN NET INTEREST AND NON-INTEREST INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH ITS INVESTMENTS IN THE EXPANSION OF ITS SBA BUSINESS AND DEPOSIT RAISING INITIATIVES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE OCC AND INTENDS TO FULLY RESOLVE ALL MATTERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OCC FORMAL AGREEMENT TO THE FULL SATISFACTION OF THE OCC.

EQUITY DECREASED $1.1 MILLION OR 1.6%, FROM $69.3 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $68.2 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO $1.3 MILLION OF NET LOSS AND $116,000 OF COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $109,000 OF INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO UNREALIZED GAIN AND $162,000 OF EQUITY COMPENSATION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED $16.4 MILLION, FROM $66.4 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $50.0 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.

THE INCREASE IN LOANS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $28.2 MILLION IN PURCHASES OF LOANS RECEIVABLE IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE LOAN PIPELINE IS STRONG. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ADD TO THE PRODUCT LINES AND ENHANCE SERVICE OFFERINGS TO CUSTOMERS.  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE NET LOAN TO DEPOSIT RATIO WAS 104% AND THE NET LOAN TO TOTAL ASSETS RATIO WAS 81%.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $3.2 MILLION IN PROVISION FOR ALL LOAN CATEGORIES, WHICH WAS OFFSET BY $2.4 MILLION NET CHARGE-OFFS OF LOANS.  BASED UPON THE OVERALL ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES $8.4 MILLION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES, WHICH REPRESENTED 1.05% OF GROSS LOANS OUTSTANDING, IS ADEQUATE UNDER PREVAILING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS TO ABSORB EXISTING LOSSES IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO.  THE INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SINGLE LOAN CHARGE-OFF OF $2.3 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND ITS RELATED IMPACT ON THE HISTORICAL LOSS RATE OF THE CORRESPONDING FEDERAL CALL CODE SEGMENT.

AVERAGE LOAN BALANCES INCREASED $67.4 MILLION OR 9.0% AS COMPARED TO THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $1.3 MILLION OR 38.0% AS COMPARED TO THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE OF $1.2 MILLION IN DEPOSIT INTERESTS DUE TO HIGHER RETAIL DEPOSIT RATES.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INTEREST INCOME INCREASED $3.2 MILLION OR 11.0% AS COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. AVERAGE LOAN BALANCES INCREASED $62.7 MILLION OR 8.5% AS COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $4.9 MILLION OR 57.5% AS COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE OF $4.3 MILLION IN DEPOSIT INTERESTS DUE TO HIGHER DEPOSIT RATES AND AN INCREASE OF $356,000 IN SUBORDINATED DEBT INTEREST.  NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $6.2 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH DECREASED 8.8% FROM $6.8 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, NET INTEREST INCOME WAS $19.2 MILLION, DECREASED 8.1% FROM $20.9 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  NET INTEREST MARGIN FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WERE 2.70% AND 2.85%, RESPECTIVELY. NET INTEREST MARGIN FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WERE 3.11% AND 3.33%, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECLINE IN NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF INCREASING DEPOSIT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER RATES PAID ON RETAIL DEPOSITS, THE IMPACT OF NON-ACCRUAL AND REDUCED RATE LOANS, AN INCREASED RELIANCE ON MORE EXPENSIVE WHOLESALE FUNDING SOURCES, AND THE IMPACT OF THE SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED IN JUNE 2018. HIGHER RETAIL DEPOSIT RATES ARE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF INCREASED RATE COMPETITION IN PATRIOT\u2019S LOCAL RETAIL MARKETS. PATRIOT IS EXPLORING ALTERNATIVE LOWER-COST FUNDING SOURCES WHICH, ALONG WITH A RECENT DECLINE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES, IS EXPECTED TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THE AGGREGATE COST OF DEPOSITS.  55  PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES  THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES FOR THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE $100,000 AND $3.2 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO $50,000 AND $285,000 FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE OF PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES IN 2019 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SINGLE $2.3 MILLION COMMERCIAL LOAN CHARGE-OFF IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WHICH IS DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES.  NON-INTEREST INCOME  NON-INTEREST INCOME INCREASED $217,000 FROM $354,000 FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 TO $571,000 FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, NON-INTEREST INCOME INCREASED $1.0 MILLION TO $2.1 MILLION, FROM $1.1 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  THE INCREASE IN BOTH THE YEAR TO DATE AND QUARTER COMPARISONS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GAIN ON SALE OF SBA LOANS OF $188,000 AND $864,000 IN THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  NON-INTEREST EXPENSE  NON-INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $632,000 FROM $6.0 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 TO $6.7 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASE OF $686,000 IN SALARIES AND BENEFITS.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, NON-INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $2.1 MILLION TO $19.9 MILLION, FROM $17.8 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES OF $1.9 MILLION IN SALARIES AND BENEFITS, $639,000 IN PROFESSIONAL AND OTHER OUTSIDE SERVICES, AND $432,000 IN OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. DUE TO CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THE BANK\u2019S BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTION OF $1.5 MILLION IN NON-RECURRING PROJECT EXPENSES.  THE INCREASE IN SALARIES AND BENEFITS REFLECTS THE BUILD-UP OF THE SBA TEAM, ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRIME ACQUISITION, AND INCREASED HEADCOUNT SUPPORTING NEW DEPOSIT INITIATIVES AND EXPANSION OF CREDIT, FINANCE AND COMPLIANCE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS.  THE INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL AND OUTSIDE SERVICE FEES INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF COSTS INCURRED WITH SBA ORIGINATION AND SALE ACTIVITIES AND ADDITIONAL EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPANSION OF DEPOSIT RAISING INITIATIVES AND RESOLUTION OF DOCUMENTATION AND POLICY MATTERS ASSOCIATED WITH RESOLUTION OF THE OCC FORMAL AGREEMENT.  PROVISION  (BENEFIT)  FOR INCOME TAXES  THE COMPANY REPORTED PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OF $8,000 AND BENEFIT FOR INCOME TAXES OF $456,000 FOR THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES OF $276,000 AND $1.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE MAINLY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF THE NET LOSS IN 2019.  LIQUIDITY  THE COMPANY\u2019S BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY TO TOTAL ASSETS RATIO WAS 10.3% AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO 10.7% AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. LIQUIDITY INCLUDING READILY AVAILABLE OFF BALANCE SHEET FUNDING SOURCES WAS 18.5% AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO 19.4% AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE COMPANY\u2019S AVAILABLE TOTAL LIQUIDITY (READILY AVAILABLE PLUS BROKERED DEPOSIT AVAILABILITY) TO TOTAL ASSETS RATIO WAS 21.7% AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO 23.7% AT DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES OF ASSETS ARE CONSIDERED BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY: CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS, FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD (IF ANY), SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS (IF ANY) AND UNPLEDGED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. IN ADDITION, OFF BALANCE SHEET FUNDING SOURCES INCLUDE COLLATERAL BASED BORROWING AVAILABLE FROM THE FHLB, CORRESPONDENT BANK BORROWING LINES, AND BROKERED DEPOSITS SUBJECT TO INTERNAL LIMITATIONS.  LIQUIDITY IS A MEASURE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO GENERATE ADEQUATE CASH TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS. THE PRINCIPAL CASH REQUIREMENTS OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION ARE TO COVER DOWNWARD FLUCTUATIONS IN DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY\u2019S LIQUID ASSETS PROVIDE SUFFICIENT COVERAGE TO SATISFY LOAN DEMAND, COVER POTENTIAL FLUCTUATIONS IN DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS, AND TO MEET OTHER ANTICIPATED OPERATIONAL CASH REQUIREMENTS.  56  CAPITAL  THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE COMPANY\u2019S AND THE BANK\u2019S REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018.

UNDER THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTION ACTION, TO BE CONSIDERED \u201cWELL CAPITALIZED,\u201d AN INSTITUTION MUST GENERALLY HAVE A LEVERAGE CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 5.0%, CET1 CAPITAL RATIO AT LEAST 6.5%, A TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 8.0% AND A TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO OF AT LEAST 10%. HOWEVER, THE OCC HAS THE DISCRETION TO REQUIRE INCREASED CAPITAL RATIOS.  UNDER THE FINAL CAPITAL RULES THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2015, THERE IS A REQUIREMENT FOR A CET1 CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER OF 2.5% OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS, WHICH IS IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL STANDARDS IN THE RULE. INSTITUTIONS THAT DO NOT MAINTAIN THIS REQUIRED CAPITAL BUFFER BECOME SUBJECT TO PROGRESSIVELY MORE STRINGENT LIMITATIONS ON THE PERCENTAGE OF EARNINGS THAT MAY BE DISTRIBUTED TO SHAREHOLDERS OR USED FOR STOCK REPURCHASES AND ON THE PAYMENT OF DISCRETIONARY BONUSES TO SENIOR EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT.  THE CAPITAL BUFFER REQUIREMENT IS BEING PHASED IN OVER THREE YEARS BEGINNING IN 2016. THE 1.875% CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER FOR 2018 HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE MINIMUM CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIOS IN THE 2018 COLUMN IN THE TABLE ABOVE. THE CAPITAL CONVERSATION BUFFER INCREASED TO 2.5% FOR 2019, WHICH HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE MINIMUM CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIOS IN THE 2019 COLUMN ABOVE.  THE CAPITAL BUFFER REQUIREMENT EFFECTIVELY RAISES THE BANK\u2019S MINIMUM REQUIRED TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO TO 10.5%, THE TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIO TO 8.5%, AND THE CET1 CAPITAL RATIO TO 7.0% ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS, WHICH WAS EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2019. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, PATRIOT SATISFIES ALL CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE BASEL III CAPITAL RULES ON A FULLY PHASED-IN BASIS.  MANAGEMENT CONTINUOUSLY ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF THE BANK\u2019S CAPITAL WITH THE GOAL TO MAINTAIN A \u201cWELL CAPITALIZED\u201d CLASSIFICATION.  IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES  THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN TERMS OF HISTORICAL DOLLARS, WITHOUT CONSIDERING CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE PURCHASING POWER OF MONEY OVER TIME DUE TO INFLATION. UNLIKE MOST INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES, VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION ARE MONETARY IN NATURE. AS A RESULT, INTEREST RATES HAVE A MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION\u2019S PERFORMANCE THAN THE EFFECT OF GENERAL LEVELS OF INFLATION. INTEREST RATES DO NOT NECESSARILY MOVE IN THE SAME DIRECTION OR WITH THE SAME MAGNITUDE AS THE PRICES OF GOODS AND SERVICES. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS, INFLATION CAN DIRECTLY AFFECT THE VALUE OF LOAN COLLATERAL, IN PARTICULAR, REAL ESTATE. INFLATION, DEFLATION OR DISINFLATION COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM  NO SHARES OF PATRIOT\u2019S COMMON STOCK WERE REPURCHASED DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  57", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "PATRIOT NATIONAL BANCORP INC", "CIK": 1098146, "Date": "2019-11-13T00:00:00", "Ticker": "PNBK", "Name": "Patriot National Bancorp Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 6021.0, "Business": "CT", "Incorporated": "CT", "IRS": 61559137.0, "key": "20191113PNBK", "labelr1": -1.267828843106168, "labelr2": -0.7223113964687129, "labelr3": -0.8892481810832613, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.14392933, "prof1": 0.85607064, "return1&2": 0.980190174326466, "return1&2&3": 0.9714738510301112, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9714738510301112, "return2": 0.9927768860353128, "return1": 0.9873217115689384, "return3": 0.9911075181891674, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": -1.2678288431061668, "cumulative_return1": 0.00044602213477342177, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.0003835914868067867, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 4.7582627737941885e-06, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 3.2988450865509093e-06, "indexx": 3510, "cumreturn1b": 0.5676142262789071, "cumreturndow": 1.0096905262471887, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0158919022871842}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3541, "level_0": 7484, "index": 94230, "text": "ITEM 2.

IS A PROVIDER OF ADVANCED IMAGE  ANALYSIS, WORKFLOW SOLUTIONS AND RADIATION THERAPY FOR THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF CANCER. THE COMPANY REPORTS IN TWO SEGMENTS \u2013CANCER DETECTION (\u201cDETECTION\u201d) AND CANCER THERAPY (\u201cTHERAPY\u201d).  IN THE DETECTION SEGMENT, OUR SOLUTIONS INCLUDE (I) ADVANCED IMAGE ANALYSIS AND WORKFLOW SOLUTIONS THAT ENABLE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS TO BETTER SERVE  PATIENTS BY IDENTIFYING PATHOLOGIES AND PINPOINTING THE MOST PREVALENT CANCERS EARLIER, AND (II) A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE, UPGRADEABLE COMPUTER-AIDED DETECTION (CAD) SYSTEMS AND WORKFLOW SOLUTIONS FOR MAMMOGRAPHY, MAGNETIC  RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) AND COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT).  THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE THE EXTENSION OF ITS IMAGE ANALYSIS AND CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT  SOLUTIONS FOR MAMMOGRAPHY AND CT IMAGING. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ADVANCES IN DIGITAL IMAGING TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS 3D MAMMOGRAPHY, SHOULD BOLSTER ITS EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL COMMERCIALLY VIABLE CAD/ADVANCED IMAGE ANALYSIS AND WORKFLOW  PRODUCTS.  IN THE THERAPY SEGMENT, THE COMPANY OFFERS AN ISOTOPE-FREE CANCER TREATMENT PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY THE XOFT ELECTRONIC BRACHYTHERAPY SYSTEM  (\u201cXOFT SYSTEM\u201d). THE XOFT SYSTEM CAN BE USED FOR THE TREATMENT OF EARLY- STAGE BREAST CANCER, ENDOMETRIAL CANCER, CERVICAL CANCER AND SKIN CANCER. WE BELIEVE THE XOFT SYSTEM PLATFORM INDICATIONS REPRESENT STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES IN THE  UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS TO OFFER DIFFERENTIATED TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES. IN ADDITION, THE XOFT SYSTEM GENERATES ADDITIONAL RECURRING REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF CONSUMABLES AND RELATED ACCESSORIES WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO DRIVE GROWTH IN  THIS SEGMENT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED IN NASHUA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, WITH A MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND AN OPERATIONS,  RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND WAREHOUSING FACILITY IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE COMPANY\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND CASH FLOWS ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  THE  PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ON AN  ON-GOING  BASIS, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THESE ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, INVENTORY VALUATION AND OBSOLESCENCE, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL, INCOME  TAXES, CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY USES ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES IN CALCULATIONS TO DETERMINE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, THE FAIR VALUE OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES, AND EVALUATION OF LITIGATION. THE COMPANY BASES ITS ESTIMATES  ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT IT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY  APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019, WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 842. REFER TO NOTE 1 OF THIS FORM  10-Q  FOR DISCLOSURE OF THE CHANGES RELATED TO THIS ADOPTION.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO ADDITIONAL MATERIAL CHANGES TO  OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS DISCUSSED IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K  (THE \u201c2018  10-K\u201d).

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE  DISCLOSURES IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ARE COMPLIMENTARY TO THOSE MADE IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2018 (\u201c2018 FORM 10-K\u201d). THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONDENSED  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) AND NOTES RELATED THERETO APPEARING ELSEWHERE IN THIS DOCUMENT AND MANAGEMENT\u2019S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN OUR 2018 FORM 10-K.  OVERVIEW  THE  MISSION OF RESPIRERX PHARMACEUTICALS INC. (\u201cRESPIRERX,\u201d THE \u201cCOMPANY,\u201d \u201cWE\u201d OR \u201cOUR\u201d)  IS TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE AND REVOLUTIONARY TREATMENTS TO COMBAT DISEASES CAUSED BY DISRUPTION OF NEURONAL SIGNALING. WE ARE DEVELOPING  TREATMENT OPTIONS THAT ADDRESS CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, BUT FOR WHICH THERE ARE FEW OR POOR TREATMENT OPTIONS,  INCLUDING OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (\u201cOSA\u201d), ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (\u201cADHD\u201d) AND RECOVERY  FROM SPINAL CORD INJURY (\u201cSCI\u201d), AS WELL AS CERTAIN NEUROLOGICAL ORPHAN DISEASES SUCH AS FRAGILE X SYNDROME. RESPIRERX  IS DEVELOPING A PIPELINE OF NEW DRUG PRODUCTS BASED ON OUR BROAD PATENT PORTFOLIOS FOR TWO DRUG PLATFORMS: AMPAKINES, PROPRIETARY  COMPOUNDS THAT POSITIVELY MODULATE AMPA-TYPE GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS TO PROMOTE NEURONAL FUNCTION AND CANNABINOIDS, INCLUDING DRONABINOL  (\u201c\u22069-THC\u201d).  AMPAKINES  SINCE  ITS FORMATION IN 1987, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN THE RESEARCH AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF A CLASS OF PROPRIETARY COMPOUNDS  KNOWN AS AMPAKINES, A TERM USED TO DESIGNATE THEIR ACTIONS AS POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATORS OF THE ALPHA-AMINO-3- HYDROXY-5-METHYL-4-ISOXAZOLEPROPIONIC  ACID (\u201cAMPA\u201d) GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR. AMPAKINES ARE SMALL MOLECULE COMPOUNDS THAT ENHANCE THE EXCITATORY ACTIONS OF THE  NEUROTRANSMITTER GLUTAMATE AT THE AMPA RECEPTOR COMPLEX, WHICH MEDIATES MOST EXCITATORY TRANSMISSION IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM  (\u201cCNS\u201d). THESE DRUGS DO NOT HAVE AGONISTIC OR ANTAGONISTIC PROPERTIES BUT INSTEAD POSITIVELY MODULATE THE RECEPTOR  RATE CONSTANTS FOR TRANSMITTER BINDING, CHANNEL OPENING, AND DESENSITIZATION. WE CURRENTLY ARE DEVELOPING TWO LEAD CLINICAL COMPOUNDS,  CX717 AND CX1739, AND ONE PRE-CLINICAL COMPOUND, CX1942. THESE COMPOUNDS BELONG TO A NEW CLASS OF AMPAKINES THAT DO NOT DISPLAY  THE ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL EFFECTS THAT LED TO UNDESIRABLE SIDE EFFECTS, NAMELY CONVULSIVE ACTIVITIES, PREVIOUSLY  REPORTED IN ANIMAL MODELS OF EARLIER GENERATIONS.  THE  COMPANY OWNS PATENTS AND PATENT APPLICATIONS, OR THE RIGHTS THERETO, FOR CERTAIN FAMILIES OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS, INCLUDING AMPAKINES,  WHICH CLAIM THE CHEMICAL STRUCTURES, THEIR ACTIONS AS AMPAKINES AND THEIR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS DISORDERS. PATENTS CLAIMING  A FAMILY OF CHEMICAL STRUCTURES, INCLUDING CX1739 AND CX1942, AS WELL AS THEIR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS DISORDERS EXTEND  THROUGH AT LEAST 2028. ADDITIONAL PATENT APPLICATIONS CLAIMING THE USE OF AMPAKINES IN THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN NEUROLOGICAL AND  NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS, SUCH AS ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (\u201cADHD\u201d) HAVE BEEN OR ARE EXPECTED TO  BE FILED IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  IN  2007, WE DETERMINED THAT EXPANSION OF OUR STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT INTO THE AREAS OF CENTRAL RESPIRATORY DYSFUNCTION, INCLUDING DRUG-INDUCED  RESPIRATORY DYSFUNCTION, REPRESENTED COST-EFFECTIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR POTENTIALLY RAPID DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF RESPIRERX\u2019S  COMPOUNDS. ON MAY 8, 2007, RESPIRERX ENTERED INTO A LICENSE AGREEMENT, AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED, WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA  GRANTING RESPIRERX EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO METHOD OF TREATMENT PATENTS HELD BY THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA CLAIMING THE USE OF AMPAKINES  FOR THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS RESPIRATORY DISORDERS. THESE PATENTS, ALONG WITH RESPIRERX\u2019S OWN PATENTS CLAIMING CHEMICAL  STRUCTURES, COMPRISED RESPIRERX\u2019S PRINCIPAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUPPORTING RESPIRERX\u2019S RESEARCH AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT  PROGRAM IN THE USE OF AMPAKINES FOR THE TREATMENT OF CENTRAL AND DRUG-INDUCED RESPIRATORY DISORDERS.  33  THROUGH  AN EXTENSIVE TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH EFFORT FROM THE CELLULAR LEVEL THROUGH PHASE 2 CLINICAL TRIALS, THE COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED  A FAMILY OF NOVEL, LOW IMPACT AMPAKINES, INCLUDING CX717, CX1739 AND CX1942 THAT HAVE CLINICAL APPLICATION IN THE TREATMENT OF  NEUROBEHAVIORAL DISORDERS, CNS-DRIVEN RESPIRATORY DISORDERS, SPINAL CORD INJURY, NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES, AND ORPHAN INDICATIONS.  WE HAVE BEEN ADDRESSING CNS-DRIVEN RESPIRATORY DISORDERS THAT AFFECT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, BUT FOR WHICH THERE ARE FEW TREATMENT  OPTIONS AND LIMITED DRUG THERAPIES, INCLUDING OPIOID INDUCED RESPIRATORY DISORDERS, SUCH AS APNEA (TRANSIENT CESSATION OF BREATHING)  OR HYPOPNEA (TRANSIENT REDUCTION IN BREATHING). WHEN THESE SYMPTOMS BECOME SEVERE, AS IN OPIOID OVERDOSE, THEY ARE THE PRIMARY  CAUSE OF OPIOID LETHALITY.  RESPIRERX  HAS COMPLETED PRE-CLINICAL STUDIES INDICATING THAT SEVERAL OF ITS AMPAKINES, INCLUDING CX717, CX1739 AND CX1942, WERE EFFICACIOUS  IN TREATING DRUG INDUCED RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION CAUSED BY OPIOIDS OR CERTAIN ANESTHETICS WITHOUT ALTERING THE ANALGESIC EFFECTS  OF THE OPIOIDS OR THE ANESTHETIC EFFECTS OF THE ANESTHETICS. THE RESULTS OF OUR PRECLINICAL RESEARCH STUDIES HAVE BEEN REPLICATED  IN THREE SEPARATE PHASE 2A HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS WITH TWO AMPAKINES, CX717 AND CX1739, CONFIRMING THE TRANSLATIONAL MECHANISM  AND TARGET SITE ENGAGEMENT AND DEMONSTRATING PROOF OF PRINCIPLE THAT AMPAKINES ACT AS POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATORS OF AMPA RECEPTORS  IN HUMANS AND CAN BE USED IN HUMANS FOR THE PREVENTION OF OPIOID INDUCED APNEA. IN ADDITION, RESPIRERX HAS CONDUCTED A PHASE 2A  CLINICAL STUDY IN WHICH PATIENTS WITH SLEEP APNEA WERE ADMINISTERED CX1739, RESPIRERX\u2019S LEAD CLINICAL COMPOUND. THE RESULTS  SUGGESTED THAT CX1739 MIGHT HAVE USE AS A TREATMENT FOR CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA (\u201cCSA\u201d) AND MIXED SLEEP APNEA, BUT NOT  OSA.  RESPIRERX  IS COMMITTED TO ADVANCING THE AMPAKINES THROUGH THE CLINICAL AND REGULATORY PATH TO APPROVAL AND COMMERCIALIZATION. UNTIL RECENTLY,  RESPIRERX HAS FOCUSED ON THE AMPAKINES\u2019 ABILITY TO ANTAGONIZE OPIOID INDUCED RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION BOTH AS A TRANSLATIONAL  TOOL TO VERIFY TARGET ENGAGEMENT, AS WELL AS AN EVENTUAL COMMERCIAL INDICATION. WE BELIEVE THE LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY 70,000 LIVES  IN OUR COUNTRY LAST YEAR ALONE DEMANDS THAT NEW SOLUTIONS FOR OPIOID INDUCED DEATHS BE DEVELOPED TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC HEALTH.  34  TO  THIS END, THE COMPANY HAS CONDUCTED PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH WITH CX1739, CX717 AND CX1942 IN THE PREVENTION, TREATMENT,  AND MANAGEMENT OF OPIOID INDUCED APNEA, THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF OVERDOSE DEATHS. IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE CONDUCTED SEVERAL PHASE 2  CLINICAL TRIALS DEMONSTRATING THAT BOTH CX717 AND CX1739 SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OPIOID INDUCED RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION (\u201cOIRD\u201d)  WITHOUT ALTERING ANALGESIA. SINCE ONE OF THE PRIMARY RISK FACTORS FOR OPIOID OVERDOSE IS CSA, IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT A PHASE 2A  CLINICAL STUDY WITH CX1739 PRODUCED DATA SUGGESTING A POSSIBLE REDUCTION IN CENTRAL SLEEP APNEA. BECAUSE THERE ARE NEITHER DRUGS  NOR DEVICES APPROVED TO TREAT CSA, COMPANY MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR A RAPID PATH TO COMMERCIALIZATION.  UNFORTUNATELY,  RATHER THAN SUPPORT NOVEL APPROACHES FOR OPIOID TREATMENT, THE RECENT PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENTAL DISCOURSES REGARDING THE \u201cOPIOID  EPIDEMIC\u201d HAS FOCUSED ALMOST ENTIRELY ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF NALOXONE, AN OPIOID ANTAGONIST USED FOR ACUTE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS,  SO-CALLED \u201cNON-ABUSEABLE\u201d OPIOID FORMULATIONS, AS WELL AS ON MEANS OF REDUCING OPIOID CONSUMPTION BY LIMITING PRODUCTION  OF OPIOIDS AND ACCESS TO LEGAL OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THESE APPROACHES WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE  SITUATION. NEVERTHELESS, AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN ONGOING INDUSTRY-WIDE PULLBACK FROM OPIOIDS, AS EVIDENCED BY  A REDUCTION IN OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS AND A MAJOR REDUCTION IN MANUFACTURING BY TWO OF THE LARGEST OPIOID MANUFACTURES IN THE UNITED  STATES.  THESE  FACTORS HAVE MADE IT DIFFICULT TO RAISE CAPITAL OR FIND STRATEGIC PARTNERS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AMPAKINES FOR THE TREATMENT  OF OPIOID INDUCED RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND WE ARE ASSESSING WHETHER TO CONTINUE WITH THIS PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, AS NOTED  ABOVE, WE HAVE DECIDED NOT TO ENTER INTO A NEW LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH TEC EDMONTON AT THIS TIME AND ARE SUSPENDING THE DEVELOPMENT  OF THIS PROGRAM UNTIL THE POLITICAL CLIMATE IS CLARIFIED AND WE ARE ABLE TO EITHER RAISE FUNDING OR ENTER INTO A STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP  FOR THIS PURPOSE. NEVERTHELESS, THE VALUABLE DATA DERIVED FROM THESE TRANSLATIONAL  STUDIES HAVE ESTABLISHED ANTAGONISM OF OIRD AS A BIOMARKER FOR DEMONSTRATING PROOF OF PRINCIPLE AND TARGET ENGAGEMENT IN SUPPORT  OF CONTINUED AMPAKINE DEVELOPMENT FOR OTHER INDICATIONS.  IN  ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS PURSUING POTENTIALLY PROMISING CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS IN NEURO-BEHAVIORAL AND COGNITIVE DISORDERS,  WITH TRANSLATIONAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON THE USE OF AMPAKINES FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADHD AND, TOGETHER WITH  OUR ACADEMIC COLLABORATORS, FOR MOTOR IMPAIRMENT RESULTING FROM SCI AND FOR FRAGILE X AUTISM.  ADHD  IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON NEUROBEHAVIORAL DISORDERS, WITH 6.1% OF AMERICAN CHILDREN TAKING MEDICATION FOR TREATMENT, AND ADHD  IS ESTIMATED TO AFFECT 7.8% OF U.S. CHILDREN AGED 4 TO 17 ACCORDING TO THE U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (\u201cCDC\u201d),  OR APPROXIMATELY 4.5 MILLION CHILDREN. THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ADHD ARE INATTENTION, HYPERACTIVITY AND IMPULSIVITY. ADHD  SYMPTOMS ARE KNOWN TO PERSIST INTO ADULTHOOD. IN A STUDY PUBLISHED IN  PSYCHIATRY RES IN MAY 2010,  UP TO 78% OF CHILDREN  AFFECTED BY THIS DISORDER SHOWED AT LEAST ONE OF THE MAJOR SYMPTOMS OF ADHD WHEN FOLLOWED UP 10 YEARS LATER. ACCORDING TO THE  CDC, APPROXIMATELY 4% OF THE US ADULT POPULATION HAS ADHD, WHICH CAN NEGATIVELY IMPAIR MANY ASPECTS OF DAILY LIFE, INCLUDING HOME,  SCHOOL, WORK AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS.  CURRENTLY  AVAILABLE TREATMENTS FOR ADHD INCLUDE AMPHETAMINE-TYPE STIMULANTS AND NON-STIMULANT AGENTS TARGETING THE MONOAMINERGIC RECEPTOR  SYSTEMS IN THE BRAIN. HOWEVER, THESE RECEPTORS ARE NOT RESTRICTED TO THE BRAIN AND ARE WIDELY FOUND THROUGHOUT THE BODY. THUS,  WHILE THESE AGENTS CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN AMELIORATING ADHD SYMPTOMS, THEY ALSO CAN PRODUCE ADVERSE CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS, SUCH  AS INCREASED HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE. EXISTING TREATMENTS ALSO AFFECT EATING HABITS AND CAN REDUCE WEIGHT GAIN AND GROWTH  IN CHILDREN AND HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH SUICIDAL IDEATION IN ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS. IN ADDITION, APPROVED STIMULANT TREATMENTS  ARE DEA CLASSIFIED AS CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES AND PRESENT LOGISTICAL ISSUES FOR DISTRIBUTION AND PROTECTION FROM DIVERSION. APPROVED  NON-STIMULANT TREATMENTS, SUCH AS ATOMOXETINE, CAN TAKE FOUR TO EIGHT WEEKS TO BECOME EFFECTIVE AND UNDESIRABLE SIDE EFFECTS HAVE  BEEN OBSERVED.  VARIOUS  INVESTIGATORS HAVE GENERATED DATA SUPPORTING THE CONCEPT THAT ALTERATIONS IN AMPA RECEPTOR FUNCTION MIGHT UNDERLIE THE PRODUCTION  OF SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS OF ADHD. IN RODENT AND PRIMATE MODELS OF COGNITION, AMPAKINES HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO REDUCE INATTENTION  AND IMPULSIVITY, TWO OF THE CARDINAL SYMPTOMS OF ADHD. FURTHERMORE, AMPAKINES DO NOT STIMULATE SPONTANEOUS LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY  IN EITHER MICE OR RATS, UNLIKE THE STIMULANTS PRESENTLY USED FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADHD, NOR DO THEY INCREASE THE STIMULATION PRODUCED  BY AMPHETAMINE OR COCAINE. THESE PRECLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS PROMPTED US TO CONDUCT A RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE- BLIND, PLACEBO CONTROLLED,  TWO PERIOD CROSSOVER STUDY TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF CX717 IN ADULTS WITH ADHD.  35  IN  A REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS, A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT TREATMENT EFFECT ON ADHD RATING SCALE (ADHD-RS), THE PRIMARY OUTCOME  MEASURE, WAS OBSERVED AFTER A THREE-WEEK ADMINISTRATION OF CX717, 800 MG BID. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS DOSE OF CX717 AND PLACEBO  WERE SEEN AS EARLY AS WEEK ONE OF TREATMENT AND CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE STUDY. THE LOW DOSE OF CX717, 200 MG  BID, DID NOT DIFFER FROM PLACEBO. IN GENERAL, RESULTS FROM BOTH THE ADHD-RS HYPERACTIVITY AND INATTENTIVENESS SUBSCALES, WHICH  WERE SECONDARY EFFICACY VARIABLES, PARALLELED THE RESULTS OF THE TOTAL SCORE. CX717 WAS CONSIDERED SAFE AND WELL TOLERATED.  BASED  ON THESE CLINICAL RESULTS, AMPAKINES SUCH AS CX717 MIGHT REPRESENT A BREAKTHROUGH OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A NON- STIMULATING THERAPEUTIC  FOR ADHD WITH THE RAPIDITY OF ONSET NORMALLY SEEN WITH STIMULANTS. SUBJECT TO RAISING SUFFICIENT FINANCING (OF WHICH NO ASSURANCE  CAN BE PROVIDED), WE ARE PLANNING TO CONTINUE THIS PROGRAM WITH A PHASE 2B CLINICAL TRIAL IN PATIENTS WITH ADULT ADHD.  AMPAKINES  ALSO MAY HAVE POTENTIAL UTILITY IN THE TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF SCI TO ENHANCE MOTOR FUNCTIONS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE  FOR SCI PATIENTS. AN ESTIMATED 17,000 NEW CASES OF SCI OCCUR EACH YEAR IN THE UNITED STATES, MOST A RESULT OF AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS.  CURRENTLY, THERE ARE ROUGHLY 282,000 PEOPLE LIVING WITH SPINAL CORD INJURIES, WHICH OFTEN PRODUCE IMPAIRED MOTOR FUNCTION.  SCI  CAN PROFOUNDLY IMPAIR NEURAL PLASTICITY LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN HUMAN ACCIDENT VICTIMS. PLASTICITY IS  A FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM THAT ENABLES CONTINUOUS ALTERATION OF NEURAL PATHWAYS AND SYNAPSES IN RESPONSE TO  EXPERIENCE OR INJURY. ONE FREQUENTLY STUDIED MODEL OF PLASTICITY IS LONG-TERM FACILITATION OF MOTOR NERVE OUTPUT (\u201cLTF\u201d).  A LARGE BODY OF LITERATURE EXISTS REGARDING THE ABILITY OF AMPAKINES TO STIMULATE NEURAL PLASTICITY, POSSIBLY DUE TO AN ENHANCED  SYNTHESIS AND SECRETION OF VARIOUS GROWTH FACTORS.  RECENTLY,  STUDIES OF ACUTE INTERMITTENT HYPOXIA (\u201cAIH\u201d) IN PATIENTS WITH SCI DEMONSTRATE THAT NEURAL PLASTICITY CAN BE INDUCED  TO IMPROVE MOTOR FUNCTION. THIS LTF IS BASED ON PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABILITY OF SPINAL CIRCUITRY TO LEARN  HOW TO ADJUST SPINAL AND BRAINSTEM SYNAPTIC STRENGTH FOLLOWING REPEATED HYPOXIC BOUTS. BECAUSE AIH INDUCES SPINAL PLASTICITY,  THE POTENTIAL EXISTS TO HARNESS REPETITIVE AIH AS A MEANS OF INDUCING FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY OF MOTOR FUNCTION FOLLOWING SCI.  RESPIRERX  HAS BEEN WORKING WITH DR. DAVID FULLER, AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA WITH FUNDING FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, TO EVALUATE  THE USE OF AMPAKINES FOR THE TREATMENT OF COMPROMISED MOTOR FUNCTION IN SCI. USING MICE THAT HAVE RECEIVED SPINAL HEMISECTIONS,  CX717 WAS OBSERVED TO INCREASE MOTOR NERVE ACTIVITY BILATERALLY. THE EFFECT ON THE HEMISECTED SIDE WAS GREATER THAN THAT MEASURED  ON THE INTACT SIDE, WITH THE RECOVERY APPROXIMATING THAT SEEN ON THE INTACT SIDE PRIOR TO ADMINISTRATION OF AMPAKINE. IN ADDITION,  CX717 WAS OBSERVED TO PRODUCE A DRAMATIC AND LONG-LASTING EFFECT ON LTF PRODUCED BY AIH. THE DOSES OF AMPAKINES ACTIVE IN SCI  WERE COMPARABLE TO THOSE DEMONSTRATING ANTAGONISM OF OIRD, INDICATING TARGET ENGAGEMENT OF THE AMPA RECEPTORS.  THESE  ANIMAL MODELS OF MOTOR NERVE FUNCTION FOLLOWING SCI SUPPORT PROOF OF CONCEPT FOR A NEW TREATMENT PARADIGM USING AMPAKINES TO IMPROVE  MOTOR FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH SCI. WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING RECENTLY GRANTED BY NIH TO DR. FULLER, RESPIRERX IS CONTINUING ITS  COLLABORATIVE PRECLINICAL RESEARCH WITH DR. FULLER WHILE IT IS PLANNING A CLINICAL TRIAL PROGRAM FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING AMPAKINES  FOR THE RESTORATION OF CERTAIN MOTOR FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH SCI. THE COMPANY IS WORKING WITH OUR CLINICAL ADVISORY PANEL AND  WITH RESEARCHERS AT HIGHLY REGARDED CLINICAL SITES TO FINALIZE A PHASE 2 CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL. WE BELIEVE THAT A CLINICAL STUDY  COULD BE INITIATED WITHIN SEVERAL MONTHS OF RAISING SUFFICIENT FINANCING. CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT HAVE A SOURCE OF SUCH FINANCING  AND WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE SUFFICIENT FUNDING.  ACCORDING  TO THE AUTISM SOCIETY, MORE THAN 3.5 MILLION AMERICANS LIVE WITH AN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (\u201cASD\u201d), A COMPLEX NEURODEVELOPMENTAL  DISORDER. FRAGILE X SYNDROME (\u201cFXS\u201d) IS THE MOST COMMON IDENTIFIABLE SINGLE-GENE CAUSE OF AUTISM, AFFECTING APPROXIMATELY  1.4 IN EVERY 10,000 MALES AND 0.9 IN EVERY 10,000 FEMALES, ACCORDING TO THE CDC. INDIVIDUALS WITH FXS AND ASD EXHIBIT A RANGE  OF ABNORMAL BEHAVIORS COMPRISING HYPERACTIVITY AND ATTENTION PROBLEMS, EXECUTIVE FUNCTION DEFICITS, HYPER- REACTIVITY TO STIMULI,  ANXIETY AND MOOD INSTABILITY. ALSO, ACCORDING THE AUTISM SOCIETY, THE PREVALENCE RATE OF ASD HAS RISEN FROM 1 IN 150 CHILDREN  IN 2000 TO 1 IN 68 CHILDREN IN 2010, WITH CURRENT ESTIMATES INDICATING A SIGNIFICANT RISE IN ASD DIAGNOSIS TO 1 IN 59 BIRTHS,  PLACING A SIGNIFICANT EMOTIONAL AND ECONOMIC BURDEN ON FAMILIES AND EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS. THE AUTISM SOCIETY ESTIMATES THE ECONOMIC  COST TO U.S. CITIZENS OF AUTISM SERVICES TO BE BETWEEN $236 AND $262 BILLION ANNUALLY.  36  SINCE  \u201cAUTISTIC DISTURBANCES\u201d WERE FIRST IDENTIFIED IN CHILDREN IN 1943, EXTENSIVE RESEARCH EFFORTS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO IDENTIFY  THE GENETIC, MOLECULAR, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND CLINICAL CAUSES OF ASD, BUT UNTIL RECENTLY THE UNDERLYING ETIOLOGY OF THE DISORDER  REMAINED ELUSIVE. TODAY, THERE ARE NO MEDICATIONS THAT CAN TREAT ASD OR ITS CORE SYMPTOMS, AND ONLY TWO ANTI-PSYCHOTIC DRUGS,  ARIPIPRAZOLE AND RISPERIDONE, ARE APPROVED BY THE UNITED STATES FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) FOR THE TREATMENT  OF IRRITABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH ASD.  THANKS  TO WIDE RANGING TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH EFFORTS, FXS AND ASD ARE CURRENTLY RECOGNIZED AS DISORDERS OF THE SYNAPSE WITH ALTERATIONS  IN DIFFERENT FORMS OF SYNAPTIC COMMUNICATION AND NEURONAL NETWORK CONNECTIVITY. FOCUSING ON THE PROTEINS AND SUBUNITS OF THE AMPA  RECEPTOR COMPLEX, AUTISM RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO (\u201cUCSD\u201d) HAVE PROPOSED THAT AMPA RECEPTOR MALFUNCTION  AND DISRUPTED GLUTAMATE SIGNAL TRANSMISSION MAY PLAY AN ETIOLOGIC ROLE IN THE BEHAVIORAL, EMOTIONAL AND NEUROCOGNITIVE PHENOTYPES  THAT REMAIN THE STANDARD FOR ASD DIAGNOSIS. FOR EXAMPLE, STARGAZIN, ALSO KNOWN AS CACNG2 (CA2+ CHANNEL \u03932 SUBUNIT), IS ONE  OF FOUR CLOSELY RELATED PROTEINS RECENTLY CATEGORIZED AS TRANSMEMBRANE AMPA RECEPTOR REGULATING PROTEINS (\u201cTARPS\u201d).  RESEARCHERS  AT UCSD HAVE BEEN STUDYING GENETIC MUTATIONS IN THE AMPA RECEPTOR COMPLEX THAT LEAD TO COGNITIVE AND FUNCTIONAL DEFICIENCIES ALONG  THE AUTISM SPECTRUM. THEY WORK WITH PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO CONDUCT DETAILED GENETIC ANALYSES IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND  THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF AUTISM. IN ONE CASE, THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH A TEENAGE PATIENT WHO HAS AN AUTISM DIAGNOSIS, WITH  A PHENOTYPE THAT IS CHARACTERIZED BY SUBTLE TOURETTE-LIKE BEHAVIORS, EXTREME AGGRESSION, AND VERBAL AND PHYSICAL OUTBURSTS WITH  DISORDERED THOUGHT. DESPITE THE BEHAVIORS, HIS LANGUAGE IS NORMAL. USING NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING AND GENOME EDITING TECHNOLOGIES,  THE RESEARCHERS IDENTIFIED A SPECIFIC MUTATION IN STARGAZIN THAT ALTERS THE CONFIGURATION AND KINETICS OF THE AMPA RECEPTOR. WHEN  THE ABERRANT SEQUENCE WAS INTRODUCED INTO C57BL6 MICE USING CRISPR (CLUSTERED REGULATORY INTERSPACED SHORT PALINDROMIC REPEATS),  THE HETEROZYGOUS ALLELE HAD A DOMINANT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE TRAFFICKING OF POST-SYNAPTIC AMPA RECEPTORS AND PRODUCED BEHAVIORS  CONSISTENT WITH A GLUTAMATERGIC DEFICIT AND SIMILAR TO WHAT HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN THE TEENAGE PATIENT.  WITH  FUNDING FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH TO UCSD, RESPIRERX IS WORKING WITH UCSD TO EXPLORE THE USE OF AMPAKINES FOR THE  AMELIORATION OF THE COGNITIVE AND OTHER DEFICITS ASSOCIATED WITH AMPA RECEPTOR GENE MUTATIONS. BECAUSE CX1739 HAS AN OPEN INVESTIGATIONAL  NEW DRUG (\u201cIND\u201d) APPLICATION, SUBJECT TO SECURING SUFFICIENT OUTSIDE FUNDING (OF WHICH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED),  WE ARE CONSIDERING A PHASE 2A CLINICAL TRIAL LATE IN 2019.  CANNABINOIDS  OSA  IS A SLEEP-RELATED BREATHING DISORDER THAT AFFLICTS AN ESTIMATED 29 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN  ACADEMY OF SLEEP MEDICINE (\u201cAASM\u201d), AND AN ADDITIONAL 26 MILLION IN GERMANY AND 8 MILLION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, AS  PRESENTED AT THE EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY SOCIETY\u2019S (\u201cERS\u201d) ANNUAL CONGRESS IN PARIS, FRANCE IN SEPTEMBER 2018.  OSA INVOLVES A DECREASE OR COMPLETE HALT IN AIRFLOW DESPITE AN ONGOING EFFORT TO BREATHE DURING SLEEP. WHEN THE MUSCLES RELAX  DURING SLEEP, SOFT TISSUE IN THE BACK OF THE THROAT COLLAPSES AND OBSTRUCTS THE UPPER AIRWAY. OSA REMAINS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER-RECOGNIZED,  AS ONLY 20% OF CASES IN THE UNITED STATES ACCORDING TO THE AASM AND 20% OF CASES GLOBALLY HAVE BEEN PROPERLY DIAGNOSED. ABOUT  24 PERCENT OF ADULT MEN AND 9 PERCENT OF ADULT WOMEN HAVE THE BREATHING SYMPTOMS OF OSA WITH OR WITHOUT DAYTIME SLEEPINESS. OSA  SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS THE LIVES OF SUFFERERS WHO DO NOT GET ENOUGH SLEEP; THEIR QUALITY OF SLEEP IS DETERIORATED SUCH THAT DAILY  FUNCTION IS COMPROMISED AND LIMITED. OSA IS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED QUALITY OF LIFE, SIGNIFICANT FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT, AND  INCREASED RISK OF ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS, ESPECIALLY IN PROFESSIONS LIKE TRANSPORTATION AND SHIPPING.  RESEARCH  HAS ESTABLISHED LINKS BETWEEN OSA AND SEVERAL IMPORTANT CO-MORBIDITIES, INCLUDING HYPERTENSION, TYPE II DIABETES, OBESITY, STROKE,  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS, AND EVEN EARLY MORTALITY. THE CONSEQUENCES OF UNDIAGNOSED  AND UNTREATED OSA ARE MEDICALLY SERIOUS AND ECONOMICALLY COSTLY. ACCORDING TO THE AASM, THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC BURDEN OF OSA IN  THE UNITED STATES IS APPROXIMATELY $162 BILLION ANNUALLY. WE BELIEVE THAT A NEW DRUG THERAPY THAT IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE  MEDICAL AND ECONOMIC BURDEN OF OSA WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES FOR OPTIMAL PRICING IN THIS COSTLY DISEASE INDICATION.  37  CONTINUOUS  POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE (\u201cCPAP\u201d) IS THE MOST COMMON TREATMENT FOR OSA. CPAP DEVICES WORK BY BLOWING PRESSURIZED AIR  INTO THE NOSE (OR MOUTH AND NOSE), WHICH KEEPS THE PHARYNGEAL AIRWAY OPEN. CPAP IS NOT CURATIVE, AND PATIENTS MUST USE THE MASK  WHENEVER THEY SLEEP. REDUCTION OF THE APNEA/HYPOPNEA INDEX (\u201cAHI\u201d) IS THE STANDARD OBJECTIVE MEASURE OF THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE IN OSA. APNEA IS THE CESSATION OF BREATHING FOR 10 SECONDS OR MORE AND HYPONEA IS A REDUCTION IN BREATHING. AHI IS THE  SUM OF APNEA AND HYPOPNEA EVENTS PER HOUR. IN THE SLEEP LABORATORY, CPAP IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING THE AHI. HOWEVER, THE  DEVICE IS CUMBERSOME AND DIFFICULT FOR MANY PATIENTS TO TOLERATE. MOST STUDIES DESCRIBE THAT 25-50% OF PATIENTS REFUSE TO INITIATE  OR COMPLETELY DISCONTINUE CPAP USE WITHIN THE FIRST SEVERAL MONTHS AND THAT MOST PATIENTS WHO CONTINUE TO USE THE DEVICE DO SO  ONLY INTERMITTENTLY.  ORAL  DEVICES MAY BE AN OPTION FOR PATIENTS WHO CANNOT TOLERATE CPAP. SEVERAL DENTAL DEVICES ARE AVAILABLE INCLUDING THE MANDIBULAR  ADVANCEMENT DEVICE (\u201cMAD\u201d) AND THE TONGUE RETAINING DEVICE (\u201cTRD\u201d). THE MAD IS THE MOST WIDELY USED DENTAL  DEVICE FOR SLEEP APNEA AND IS SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE TO A SPORTS MOUTH GUARD. IT FORCES THE LOWER JAW FORWARD AND DOWN SLIGHTLY  WHICH KEEPS THE AIRWAY MORE OPEN. THE TRD IS A SPLINT THAT HOLDS THE TONGUE IN PLACE TO KEEP THE AIRWAY AS OPEN AS POSSIBLE. LIKE  CPAP, ORAL DEVICES ARE NOT CURATIVE FOR PATIENTS WITH OSA. THE COST OF THESE DEVICES TENDS TO BE HIGH AND SIDE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED  WITH THEM INCLUDE NIGHT TIME PAIN, DRY LIPS, TOOTH DISCOMFORT, AND EXCESSIVE SALIVATION.  PATIENTS  WITH CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT OSA WHO CANNOT BE TREATED ADEQUATELY WITH CPAP OR ORAL DEVICES CAN ELECT TO UNDERGO SURGERY. THE MOST  COMMON SURGERY IS UVULOPALATOPHARYNGOPLASTY WHICH INVOLVES THE REMOVAL OF EXCESS TISSUE IN THE THROAT TO MAKE THE AIRWAY WIDER.  OTHER POSSIBLE SURGERIES INCLUDE TRACHEOSTOMIES, REBUILDING OF THE LOWER JAW, AND NOSE SURGERY. PATIENTS WHO UNDERGO SURGERY FOR  THE TREATMENT OF OSA RISK COMPLICATIONS, INCLUDING INFECTION, CHANGES IN VOICE FREQUENCY, AND IMPAIRED SENSE OF SMELL. SURGERY  IS OFTEN UNSUCCESSFUL AND, AT PRESENT, NO METHOD EXISTS TO RELIABLY PREDICT THERAPEUTIC OUTCOME FROM THESE FORMS OF OSA SURGERY.  RECENTLY,  ANOTHER SURGICAL OPTION HAS BECOME AVAILABLE BASED ON UPPER AIRWAY STIMULATION. IT IS A COMBINATION OF AN IMPLANTABLE NERVE STIMULATOR  AND AN EXTERNAL REMOTE CONTROLLED BY THE PATIENT. THE HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE IS A MOTOR NERVE THAT CONTROLS THE TONGUE. THE IMPLANTED  DEVICE STIMULATES THE NERVE WITH EVERY ATTEMPTED BREATH, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH STIMULATION IS NEEDED FOR THAT BREATH, TO  INCREASE MUSCLE TONE TO PREVENT THE TONGUE AND OTHER SOFT TISSUES FROM COLLAPSING. THE SURGICALLY IMPLANTED DEVICE IS TURNED ON  AT NIGHT AND OFF IN THE MORNING BY THE PATIENT WITH THE REMOTE.  THE  POOR TOLERANCE AND LONG-TERM ADHERENCE TO CPAP, AS WELL AS THE LIMITATIONS OF MECHANICAL DEVICES AND SURGERY, MAKE DISCOVERY OF  THERAPEUTIC ALTERNATIVES CLINICALLY RELEVANT AND IMPORTANT. RESPIRERX\u2019S TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT  DRONABINOL, A SYNTHETIC CANNABINOID, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME THE FIRST DRUG TREATMENT FOR THIS LARGE AND UNDERSERVED MARKET.  IN  ORDER TO EXPAND RESPIRERX\u2019S RESPIRATORY DISORDERS PROGRAM AND DEVELOP CERTAIN COMPOUNDS REFERRED TO AS CANNABINOIDS FOR  THE TREATMENT OF OSA, RESPIRERX ACQUIRED 100% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING EQUITY SECURITIES OF PIER PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. (\u201cPIER\u201d)  EFFECTIVE AUGUST 10, 2012 PURSUANT TO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER. PIER HAD BEEN FORMED IN JUNE 2007 (UNDER THE NAME STEADYSLEEP  RX CO.) AS A CLINICAL STAGE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY TO DEVELOP A PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT FOR OSA AND HAD BEEN ENGAGED IN RESEARCH  AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.  THROUGH  THE MERGER, RESPIRERX GAINED ACCESS TO AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT (AS AMENDED, THE \u201cOLD LICENSE AGREEMENT\u201d) THAT  PIER HAD ENTERED INTO WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO (THE \u201cUIC\u201d) ON OCTOBER 10, 2007. THE OLD LICENSE  AGREEMENT COVERED CERTAIN PATENTS AND PATENT APPLICATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES CLAIMING THE USE OF CANNABINOIDS,  OF WHICH DRONABINOL IS A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE, FOR THE TREATMENT OF SLEEP-RELATED BREATHING DISORDERS (INCLUDING SLEEP APNEA). PIER\u2019S  BUSINESS PLAN WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER DRONABINOL WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE CLINICAL MEASURES IN PATIENTS  WITH OSA.  THE  OLD LICENSE AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED EFFECTIVE MARCH 21, 2013 AND THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NEW LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE \u201c2014  LICENSE AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH THE UIC ON JUNE 27, 2014, THE MATERIAL TERMS OF WHICH WERE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE OLD LICENSE  AGREEMENT. THE 2014 LICENSE AGREEMENT GRANTS THE COMPANY, AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS, EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS: (I) TO PRACTICE CERTAIN PATENTS  IN THE UNITED STATES, GERMANY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, AS DEFINED IN THE 2014 LICENSE AGREEMENT, THAT ARE HELD BY THE UIC; (II)  TO IDENTIFY, DEVELOP, MAKE, HAVE MADE, IMPORT, EXPORT, LEASE, SELL, HAVE SOLD OR OFFER FOR SALE ANY RELATED LICENSED PRODUCTS;  AND (III) TO GRANT SUB-LICENSES OF THE RIGHTS GRANTED IN THE 2014 LICENSE AGREEMENT, SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE 2014 LICENSE  AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED UNDER THE 2014 LICENSE AGREEMENT, AMONG OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS, TO PAY THE UIC A LICENSE  FEE, ROYALTIES, PATENT COSTS AND CERTAIN MILESTONE PAYMENTS.  38  DRONABINOL  IS A SYNTHETIC DERIVATIVE OF \u03949-THC, ONE OF THE PHARMACOLOGICALLY ACTIVE SUBSTANCES NATURALLY OCCURRING IN THE CANNABIS  PLANT. DRONABINOL IS A SCHEDULE III, CONTROLLED GENERIC DRUG THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR THE TREATMENT OF AIDS- RELATED  ANOREXIA AND CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING. DRONABINOL IS AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES AS THE BRANDED PRESCRIPTION  DRUG PRODUCT MARINOL\u00ae CAPSULES. MARINOL\u00ae, TOGETHER WITH NUMEROUS GENERIC FORMULATIONS, IS AVAILABLE IN 2.5, 5, AND 10  MG CAPSULES, WITH A MAXIMUM LABELLED DOSAGE OF 20 MG/DAY FOR THE AIDS INDICATION, OR 15 MG/M2 PER DOSE FOR CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED  NAUSEA AND VOMITING.  THE  COMPANY CONDUCTED A 21-DAY, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, DOSE ESCALATION PHASE 2A CLINICAL STUDY IN 22 PATIENTS  WITH OSA, IN WHICH DRONABINOL PRODUCED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN AHI, THE PRIMARY THERAPEUTIC END-POINT, AND WAS  OBSERVED TO BE SAFE AND WELL TOLERATED, WITH THE FREQUENCY OF SIDE EFFECTS NO DIFFERENT FROM PLACEBO (PRASAD  ET AL, FRONTIERS  IN PSYCHIATRY  , 2013). THIS CLINICAL TRIAL PROVIDED DATA ALLOWING FOR THE SUBMISSION OF PATENT APPLICATIONS CLAIMING UNIQUE  DOSAGE STRENGTHS AND CONTROLLED RELEASE FORMULATIONS OPTIMIZED FOR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF OSA. IF APPROVED, THESE PENDING PATENTS  WOULD EXTEND MARKET EXCLUSIVITY UNTIL 2036.  WITH  APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION IN FUNDING FROM THE NATIONAL HEART, LUNG AND BLOOD INSTITUTE OF NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (\u201cNIH\u201d),  DR. DAVID CARLEY OF UIC, ALONG WITH HIS COLLEAGUES AT UIC AND NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY, RECENTLY COMPLETED A PHASE 2B MULTI-CENTER,  DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL OF DRONABINOL IN PATIENTS WITH OSA. ENTITLED PHARMACOTHERAPY OF APNEA WITH CANNABIMIMETIC  ENHANCEMENT (\u201cPACE\u201d), THIS STUDY REPLICATED THE EARLIER PHASE 2A STUDY. THE AUTHORS REPORTED (CARLEY  ET AL  ,  SLEEP  , 2018) THAT, IN A DOSE DEPENDENT FASHION, TREATMENT WITH 2.5MG AND 10MG OF DRONABINOL ONCE A DAY AT NIGHT, SIGNIFICANTLY  REDUCED, COMPARED TO PLACEBO, THE AHI DURING SLEEP IN 56 EVALUABLE PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE OSA WHO COMPLETED THE STUDY.  ADDITIONALLY, TREATMENT WITH 10MG OF DRONABINOL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED DAYTIME SLEEPINESS AS MEASURED BY THE EPWORTH SLEEPINESS  SCALE AND ACHIEVED THE GREATEST OVERALL PATIENT SATISFACTION. AS IN THE PREVIOUS STUDY, DRONABINOL WAS OBSERVED TO BE SAFE AND  WELL TOLERATED, WITH THE FREQUENCY OF SIDE EFFECTS NO DIFFERENT FROM PLACEBO. THE COMPANY DID NOT MANAGE OR FUND THIS CLINICAL  TRIAL WHICH WAS FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL HEART, LUNG AND BLOOD INSTITUTE OF NIH.  THE  USE OF DRONABINOL FOR THE TREATMENT OF OSA IS A NOVEL INDICATION FOR AN ALREADY APPROVED DRUG AND, AS SUCH, THE COMPANY BELIEVES  THAT IT WOULD ALLOW US OR A DEVELOPMENT PARTNER TO SUBMIT A 505(B)(2) NEW DRUG APPLICATION (\u201cNDA\u201d) TO THE FDA FOR  APPROVAL OF A NEW DRONABINOL LABEL, AS OPPOSED TO THE SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL OF A FULL 505(B)(1) NDA. THE 505(B)(2) NDA WAS CREATED  BY THE HATCH-WAXMAN AMENDMENTS TO THE FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG AND COSMETIC ACT, IN PART, TO HELP AVOID UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION OF STUDIES  ALREADY PERFORMED ON A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED DRUG; THE SECTION GIVES THE FDA EXPRESS PERMISSION TO RELY ON DATA NOT DEVELOPED BY  THE NDA APPLICANT. A 505(B)(2) NDA CONTAINS FULL SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS REPORTS BUT ALLOWS AT LEAST SOME OF THE INFORMATION  REQUIRED FOR NDA APPROVAL, SUCH AS SAFETY AND EFFICACY INFORMATION ON THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT, TO COME FROM STUDIES NOT CONDUCTED  BY OR FOR THE APPLICANT. THIS CAN RESULT IN A LESS EXPENSIVE AND FASTER ROUTE TO APPROVAL, COMPARED WITH A TRADITIONAL DEVELOPMENT  PATH, SUCH AS 505(B)(1), WHILE CREATING NEW, DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS. THIS REGULATORY PATH OFFERS MARKET PROTECTIONS UNDER HATCH-WAXMAN  PROVISIONS FOR MARKET EXCLUSIVITY AT THE FDA. OTHER REGULATORY ROUTES ARE AVAILABLE TO PURSUE PROPRIETARY FORMULATIONS OF DRONABINOL  THAT WILL PROVIDE FURTHER MARKET PROTECTIONS. IN EUROPE, A REGULATORY APPROVAL ROUTE SIMILAR TO THE 505(B)(2) PATHWAY IS THE HYBRID  PROCEDURE BASED ON ARTICLE 10 OF DIRECTIVE 2001/83/EC.  IN  CONJUNCTION WITH ITS MANAGEMENT AND CONSULTANTS, RESPIRERX HAS DEVELOPED A REGULATORY STRATEGY IN WHICH WE INTEND TO FILE A NEW  NDA UNDER SECTION 505(B)(2) CLAIMING THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF OUR PROPOSED PROPRIETARY DRONABINOL FORMULATION IN THE TREATMENT  OF OSA. WE HAVE ENGAGED CAMARGO PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES, LLC TO ACT AS REGULATORY CONSULTANTS AND ASSIST WITH FDA FILINGS AND  REGULATORY STRATEGY. IF WE CAN SECURE SUFFICIENT FINANCING, OF WHICH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED, WE ANTICIPATE REQUESTING A  PRE-IND MEETING WITH THE FDA. THIS MEETING ALSO COULD CREATE THE TYPE OF DIALOGUE WITH THE FDA THAT IS NORMALLY COMMUNICATED AT  AN END-OF PHASE 2 MEETING. THE FDA RESPONSES TO THIS MEETING WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO AN IND, WHICH WE BELIEVE WE COULD BE IN  A POSITION TO SUBMIT WITHIN 60 DAYS OF RECEIVING THEIR COMMUNICATION.  UNLIKE  A STANDARD 505(B)(1) NDA, THE 505(B)(2) PROCESS BEGINS WITH A PRE-IND MEETING WITH THE FDA, THEN MOVES TO FORMULATION DEVELOPMENT  (AND NONCLINICAL STUDIES, IF NECESSARY) AND THEN TO THE IND (INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG) FILING. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRE-IND MEETING  WILL INVOLVE DISCUSSIONS OF FORMULATION AND SAFETY, AS WELL AS CERTAIN REQUIRED CLINICAL TRIALS. IF WE CAN SECURE SUFFICIENT FINANCING,  OF WHICH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED, WE PLAN TO PROPOSE CONDUCTING A CLINICAL STUDY WITH OUR PROPRIETARY CONTROLLED RELEASE  FORMULATION IN OSA PATIENTS TO DETERMINE SAFETY, PHARMACOKINETICS AND EFFICACY. IN ADDITION, IF WE SECURE SUFFICIENT FUNDING,  WE INTEND TO PROPOSE A STANDARD PHASE 1 CLINICAL STUDY TO DETERMINE POTENTIAL ABUSE LIABILITY. WHEN A PHASE 3 STUDY IS REQUIRED  FOR A 505(B)(2), USUALLY ONLY ONE STUDY WITH FEWER PATIENTS IS NECESSARY VERSUS THE TWO, LARGE SCALE, CONFIRMATORY STUDIES GENERALLY  REQUIRED FOR 505(B)(1). WHILE NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED, WITH AN EXTENSIVE SAFETY DATABASE TRACKING CHRONIC, LONG-TERM USE  OF MARINOL\u00ae AND GENERICS, WE BELIEVE THAT FDA SHOULD NOT HAVE MAJOR SAFETY CONCERNS WITH DRONABINOL IN THE TREATMENT OF OSA.  39  RESPIRERX  HAS WORKED WITH THE PACE INVESTIGATORS AND STAFF, AS WELL AS WITH OUR CLINICAL ADVISORY PANEL TO DESIGN A PHASE 3 PROTOCOL THAT,  BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS FROM THE PHASE 2A AND PHASE 2B TRIALS, WE BELIEVE WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT DATA FOR FDA APPROVAL  OF A RESPIRERX DRONABINOL CONTROLLED RELEASE FORMULATION FOR OSA. THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE PROTOCOL IS DESIGNED AS A 90-DAY  RANDOMIZED, BLINDED, PLACEBO CONTROLLED STUDY OF DRONABINOL IN THE TREATMENT OF OSA. DEPENDING ON FEEDBACK FROM THE FDA, RESPIRERX  ESTIMATES THAT THE PHASE 3 TRIAL WOULD REQUIRE BETWEEN 120 AND 300 PATIENTS AT 15 TO 20 SITES, AND TAKE 18 TO 24 MONTHS TO COMPLETE,  AT A COST OF BETWEEN $10 MILLION AND $14 MILLION. SUBJECT TO RAISING SUFFICIENT FINANCING, OF WHICH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED,  RESPIRERX INTENDS TO SUBMIT THE PHASE 3 PROTOCOL TO THE FDA.  SUBJECT  TO RAISING SUFFICIENT FINANCING (OF WHICH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED), RESPIRERX INTENDS TO HIRE CLINILABS DRUG DEVELOPMENT  CORPORATION, A FULL-SERVICE CRO, TO CONSULT AND POTENTIALLY PROVIDE CLINICAL SITE MANAGEMENT, MONITORING, DATA MANAGEMENT, AND  CENTRALIZED SLEEP MONITORING SERVICES FOR THE PHASE 3 OSA TRIAL. DR. GARY ZAMMITT, CEO OF CLINILABS, SERVES ON THE RESPIRERX CLINICAL  ADVISORY PANEL, AND HIS MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS PROVIDED GUIDANCE ON STUDY DESIGN AND CNS DRUG DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL BE RELEVANT FOR  THE PHASE 3 PROGRAM. FOR EXAMPLE, CLINILABS OFFERS SPECIALIZED CLINICAL TRIAL SERVICES FOR CNS DRUG DEVELOPMENT THROUGH AN ALLIANCE  WITH NEUROCLINICS, INCLUDING CLINICAL TRIALS EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF DRUGS ON DRIVING, COGNITIVE EFFECTS OF FOOD AND (MEDICINAL)  DRUGS, AND SLEEP AND SLEEP DISORDERED BREATHING.  ON  SEPTEMBER 4, 2018, RESPIRERX ENTERED INTO A DRONABINOL DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH NORAMCO INC., ONE OF THE WORLD\u2019S  MAJOR DRONABINOL MANUFACTURERS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, NORAMCO AGREED TO (I) PROVIDE ALL OF THE ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL  INGREDIENT (\u201cAPI\u201d) ESTIMATED TO BE NEEDED FOR THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS FOR BOTH THE FIRST- AND SECOND- GENERATION  PRODUCTS (EACH A \u201cPRODUCT\u201d AND COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cPRODUCTS\u201d), THREE VALIDATION BATCHES FOR NDA FILING(S)  AND ADEQUATE SUPPLY FOR THE INITIAL INVENTORY STOCKING FOR THE WHOLESALE AND RETAIL CHANNELS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS,  (II) MAINTAIN OR FILE VALID DRUG MASTER FILES (\u201cDMFS\u201d) WITH THE FDA OR ANY OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND PROVIDE  THE COMPANY WITH ACCESS OR A RIGHT OF REFERENCE LETTER ENTITLING THE COMPANY TO MAKE CONTINUING REFERENCE TO THE DMFS DURING THE  TERM OF THE AGREEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH ANY REGULATORY FILINGS MADE WITH THE FDA BY THE COMPANY, (III) PARTICIPATE ON A DEVELOPMENT  COMMITTEE, AND (IV) MAKE AVAILABLE ITS REGULATORY CONSULTANTS, COLLABORATE WITH ANY REGULATORY CONSULTING FIRMS ENGAGED BY THE  COMPANY AND PARTICIPATE IN ALL FDA OR DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCY (\u201cDEA\u201d) MEETINGS AS APPROPRIATE AND AS RELATED TO THE  API.  IN  CONSIDERATION FOR THESE SUPPLIES AND SERVICES, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED (I) TO PURCHASE EXCLUSIVELY FROM NORAMCO, DURING THE COMMERCIALIZATION  PHASE, ALL API FOR ITS PRODUCTS (AS DEFINED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT) AT A PRE-DETERMINED PRICE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN  PRODUCER PRICE ADJUSTMENTS AND (II) NORAMCO\u2019S PARTICIPATION IN THE ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF THE COMMERCIALIZED PRODUCT OR PRODUCTS  UP TO THE EARLIER OF THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A MAXIMUM DOLLAR AMOUNT OR THE EXPIRATION OF A PERIOD OF TIME.  WHILE  WE INITIALLY BELIEVED THAT THE MOST DIRECT ROUTE TO COMMERCIALIZATION WAS TO PROCEED DIRECTLY TO A PHASE 3 PIVOTAL CLINICAL  TRIAL USING THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE DRONABINOL FORMULATION (2.5, 5 AND 10 MG GEL CAPS) AND TO COMMERCIALIZE A RESPIRERX BRANDED  DRONABINOL CAPSULE (\u201cRBDC\u201d) WITH AN NDA, SEVERAL RECENT DEVELOPMENTS HAVE CAUSED US TO RE-EVALUATE THIS APPROACH.  FIRST, IN THE PAST 6 TO 12 MONTHS, NEW FORMULATION TECHNOLOGY HAS EMERGED ALLOWING THE CREATION OF A PROPRIETARY DRONABINOL FORMULATION  WITH POTENTIALLY OPTIMIZED DOSE AND DURATION OF ACTION FOR TREATING OSA. SECOND, DISCUSSIONS IN PROCESS WITH A NUMBER OF FORMULATION  COMPANIES WITH EXISTING DRONABINOL FORMULATION TECHNOLOGIES, EXPERTISE, AND LICENSURE CAPABILITIES MAY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT  OF A PROPRIETARY FORMULATION OF DRONABINOL FOR RESPIRERX BASED ON RESPIRERX\u2019S PENDING PATENTS FOR LOW-DOSE AND EXTENDED  RELEASE DRONABINOL. THIS HAS LED US TO CONCLUDE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL, PROPRIETARY FORMULATION OF DRONABINOL WOULD ONLY  DELAY MARKET ENTRY BY APPROXIMATELY 12 MONTHS. THIRD, WE RECENTLY HAVE FILED A CONTINUATION IN PART FOR OUR PENDING PATENT CLAIMING  DOSAGE AND CONTROLLED RELEASE OF DRONABINOL AS WELL AS A NEW U.S. PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION FURTHER CLAIMING DOSAGE AND CONTROLLED  RELEASE OF CANNABINOIDS ALONE OR IN COMBINATION INCLUDING WITH NON-CANNABINOID MOLECULES. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE NEW FILINGS, IF  APPROVED, SHOULD PROVIDE MARKET PROTECTIONS THROUGH AT LEAST 2036. FINALLY, A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL CANNABINOID INVESTORS AND STRATEGIC  PARTNERS WITH WHOM WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST ONLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW, PROPRIETARY FORMULATION WITH  EXTENDED PATENT LIFE.  40  WE  HAVE IDENTIFIED, AND INITIATED DISCUSSIONS WITH, SEVERAL FORMULATION COMPANIES WITH EXISTING DRONABINOL FORMULATIONS,  EXPERTISE AND LICENSURE TO DEVELOP A PROPRIETARY FORMULATION OF DRONABINOL FOR RESPIRERX BASED ON RESPIRERX\u2019S PENDING  PATENTS FOR LOW-DOSE AND EXTENDED RELEASE DRONABINOL. HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE PROVIDED THAT FORMULATION AGREEMENTS WILL  BE CONSUMMATED ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US. THE FAILURE TO CONSUMMATE THESE AGREEMENTS WOULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT  THE COMPANY.  TECHNOLOGY  RIGHTS  UNIVERSITY  OF ILLINOIS LICENSE AGREEMENT  SEE  NOTE 8.

THE WPS SEGMENT REALIZED LOW-SINGLE DIGIT SALES GROWTH IN DIGITAL SALES, WHILE SALES THROUGH THE CATALOG CHANNEL DECLINED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GROSS MARGIN FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , DECREASED  3.5%  TO  $141.4  MILLION, COMPARED TO  $146.5  MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, GROSS MARGIN DECREASED TO  49.3%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , FROM  50.0%  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INPUT COSTS SUCH AS PERSONNEL, MATERIAL, TARIFF, AND FREIGHT COSTS, ALONG WITH REDUCED SALES VOLUME, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND DRIVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, INCLUDING INCREASED AUTOMATION IN OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\u201cR&D\u201d) EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , DECREASED  3.2%  TO  $11.0 MILLION  , COMPARED TO  $11.3 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, R&D EXPENSES REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE COMPANY REMAINS COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TO INCREASE SALES WITHIN OUR IDS AND WPS BUSINESSES. INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRINTERS AND MATERIALS CONTINUE TO BE THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF R&D EXPENDITURES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (\"SG&A\") INCLUDE SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE IDS AND WPS SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDING FINANCE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, HUMAN RESOURCES, AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF THE DECREASE IN SG&A WAS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, AND THE REMAINDER WAS DUE TO ONGOING EFFICIENCY GAINS AND CONTINUED EFFORTS TO REDUCE SG&A COSTS.  OPERATING INCOME WAS  $40.9 MILLION  AND  $40.6 MILLION  FOR  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SEGMENT PROFIT IN THE IDS SEGMENT AND REDUCED SG&A IN BOTH SEGMENTS.  OPERATING INCOME TO NET INCOME  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019%  SALES  2018%  SALES  OPERATING INCOME  $40,891  14.3%  $40,622  13.9%  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES HELD IN DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS AND AN INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  INTEREST EXPENSE REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT AT  $0.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , FROM  $0.7 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR AS THERE WAS MINIMAL CHANGE IN THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL BALANCE UNDER ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT AGREEMENTS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

ORGANIC SALES IN ASIA DECREASED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN THE SAFETY AND FACILITY ID AND PRODUCT ID PRODUCT LINES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN THE WIRE ID PRODUCT LINE. ORGANIC SALES DECLINED IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGITS WITHIN CHINA PARTIALLY DUE TO THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACT OF TARIFFS, AND REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT IN THE REST OF ASIA.

SALES THROUGH THE DIGITAL CHANNEL INCREASED IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGITS WHILE SALES THROUGH THE CATALOG CHANNEL DECREASED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS.  ORGANIC SALES IN THE AMERICAS DECLINED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A LOW-SINGLE DIGIT DECLINE IN CATALOG SALES AND A SLIGHT DECLINE IN SALES THROUGH THE DIGITAL CHANNEL. THIS BUSINESS CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON SALES FROM A DIGITAL PLATFORM THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN FISCAL 2018 AND TRANSITIONED TO A NEW DIGITAL PLATFORM IN FISCAL 2019 TO ADDRESS THIS DECLINE. THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE NEW DIGITAL PLATFORM HAS IMPROVED COMPARED TO THE FORMER DIGITAL PLATFORM; HOWEVER, SALES HAVE NOT YET RETURNED TO THE LEVEL EXPERIENCED PRIOR TO THE INITIAL PLATFORM CHANGE IN FISCAL 2018.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PAYMENTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $7.2 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $5.7 MILLION  USED IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

ON MAY 13, 2010, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF \u20ac75.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES TO ACCREDITED INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS.

THIS PRIVATE PLACEMENT WAS EXEMPT FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933. THE NOTES HAVE BEEN FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED ON AN UNSECURED BASIS BY THE COMPANY\u2019S DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES.  ON AUGUST 1, 2019, THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO AN UNSECURED $200 MILLION MULTI-CURRENCY REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT WITH A GROUP OF FIVE BANKS THAT REPLACED AND TERMINATED THE COMPANY\u2019S PREVIOUS LOAN AGREEMENT THAT HAD BEEN ENTERED INTO ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2015. UNDER THE NEW REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS THE OPTION TO SELECT EITHER A BASE INTEREST RATE (BASED UPON THE HIGHER OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE PLUS ONE-HALF OF 1% OR THE PRIME RATE OF THE BANK OF MONTREAL PLUS A MARGIN BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED NET LEVERAGE RATIO), OR THE EUROCURRENCY INTEREST RATE (AT THE LIBOR RATE PLUS A MARGIN BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED NET LEVERAGE RATIO) PLUS 1%. AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, THE AVAILABLE AMOUNT UNDER THE REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT MAY BE INCREASED FROM $200 MILLION TO $400 MILLION.

THE COMPANY  HAD LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT OF $3.6 MILLION AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND THERE WAS $196.4 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE BORROWING, WHICH CAN BE INCREASED TO $396.4 MILLION AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  THE REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT HAS A FINAL MATURITY DATE OF AUGUST 1, 2024. AS SUCH, THE BORROWING IS INCLUDED IN \"LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS, LESS CURRENT MATURITIES\" ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S DEBT AGREEMENTS REQUIRE IT TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING A RATIO OF DEBT TO THE TRAILING 12 MONTHS EBITDA, AS DEFINED IN THE DEBT AGREEMENTS, OF NOT MORE THAN A 3.5 TO 1.0 RATIO (LEVERAGE RATIO) AND THE TRAILING 12 MONTHS EBITDA TO INTEREST EXPENSE OF NOT LESS THAN A 3.0 TO 1.0 RATIO (INTEREST EXPENSE COVERAGE). AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, WITH THE RATIO OF DEBT TO EBITDA, AS DEFINED BY THE AGREEMENTS, EQUAL TO 0.0 TO 1.0 AND THE INTEREST EXPENSE COVERAGE RATIO EQUAL TO 72.1 TO 1.0.  THE COMPANY'S CASH BALANCES ARE GENERATED AND HELD IN NUMEROUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY 44% OF THE COMPANY'S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE HELD OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY'S GROWTH HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN FUNDED BY A COMBINATION OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND DEBT FINANCING. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND ITS BORROWING CAPACITY ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND ITS ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, SCHEDULED DEBT REPAYMENTS, AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE MATERIAL OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.

YOU SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING PROVIDER OF ONLINE AUCTIONS AND VEHICLE REMARKETING SERVICES WITH OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cU.S.\u201d), CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM (\u201cU.K.\u201d), BRAZIL, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, GERMANY, FINLAND, THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (\u201cU.A.E.\u201d), OMAN, BAHRAIN, AND SPAIN.  OUR GOALS ARE TO GENERATE SUSTAINABLE PROFITS FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS, WHILE ALSO PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS FOR THE WORLD AROUND US. WITH RESPECT TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, WE BELIEVE OUR BUSINESS IS A CRITICAL ENABLER FOR THE GLOBAL RE-USE AND RECYCLING OF VEHICLES, PARTS AND RAW MATERIALS. MANY OF THE CARS WE PROCESS AND REMARKET ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RESTORED TO DRIVABLE CONDITION, REDUCING THE NEW VEHICLE MANUFACTURING BURDEN THE WORLD WOULD OTHERWISE FACE. MANY OF OUR CARS ARE PURCHASED BY DISMANTLERS, WHO RECYCLE AND REFURBISH PARTS FOR VEHICLE REPAIRS, AGAIN REDUCING NEW AND AFTERMARKET PARTS MANUFACTURING. AND FINALLY, SOME OF OUR VEHICLES ARE RETURNED TO THEIR RAW MATERIAL INPUTS THROUGH SCRAPPING, REDUCING THE NEED FOR FURTHER DE NOVO RESOURCE EXTRACTION. IN EACH CASE, OUR BUSINESS HAS REDUCED THE CARBON AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT OF THE GLOBAL TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY. BEYOND OUR ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, WE ALSO SUPPORT THE WORLD\u2019S COMMUNITIES IN TWO IMPORTANT WAYS. FIRST, WE BELIEVE THAT WE CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND WELL-BEING BY ENABLING MORE AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO MOBILITY AROUND THE WORLD. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY OF THE AUTOMOBILES SOLD THROUGH OUR AUCTION PLATFORM ARE PURCHASED FOR USE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHERE AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION IS A CRITICAL ENABLER OF EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, AND WELL-BEING MORE GENERALLY. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL ROLE WE PLAY IN RESPONDING TO CATASTROPHIC WEATHER EVENTS, WE BELIEVE WE CONTRIBUTE TO DISASTER RECOVERY AND RESILIENCE IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MOBILIZED OUR PEOPLE, ENTERED INTO EMERGENCY LEASES, AND ENGAGED WITH A MULTITUDE OF SERVICE PROVIDERS TO TIMELY RETRIEVE, STORE, AND REMARKET TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FLOOD-DAMAGED VEHICLES IN THE HOUSTON, TEXAS METROPOLITAN AREA IN THE WAKE OF HURRICANE HARVEY IN THE SUMMER OF 2017.  WE PROVIDE VEHICLE SELLERS WITH A FULL RANGE OF SERVICES TO PROCESS AND SELL VEHICLES PRIMARILY OVER THE INTERNET THROUGH OUR VIRTUAL BIDDING THIRD GENERATION INTERNET AUCTION-STYLE SALES TECHNOLOGY, WHICH WE REFER TO AS VB3. VEHICLE SELLERS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF INSURANCE COMPANIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDE BANKS, FINANCE COMPANIES, CHARITIES, FLEET OPERATORS, DEALERS AND VEHICLES SOURCED DIRECTLY FROM INDIVIDUAL OWNERS. WE SELL THE VEHICLES PRINCIPALLY TO LICENSED VEHICLE DISMANTLERS, REBUILDERS, REPAIR LICENSEES, USED VEHICLE DEALERS AND EXPORTERS AND, AT CERTAIN LOCATIONS, TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE MAJORITY OF THE VEHICLES SOLD ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE EITHER DAMAGED VEHICLES DEEMED A TOTAL LOSS; NOT ECONOMICALLY REPAIRABLE BY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES; OR ARE RECOVERED STOLEN VEHICLES FOR WHICH AN INSURANCE SETTLEMENT WITH THE VEHICLE OWNER HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE. WE OFFER VEHICLE SELLERS A FULL RANGE OF SERVICES THAT HELP EXPEDITE EACH STAGE OF THE VEHICLE SALES PROCESS, MINIMIZE ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROCESSING COSTS, AND MAXIMIZE THE ULTIMATE SALES PRICE THROUGH THE ONLINE AUCTION PROCESS.  IN THE U.S., CANADA, BRAZIL, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, FINLAND, THE U.A.E., OMAN, AND BAHRAIN, WE SELL VEHICLES PRIMARILY AS AN AGENT AND DERIVE REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM AUCTION AND AUCTION RELATED SALES TRANSACTION FEES CHARGED FOR VEHICLE REMARKETING SERVICES AS WELL AS FEES FOR SERVICES SUBSEQUENT TO THE AUCTION, SUCH AS DELIVERY AND STORAGE. IN THE U.K., GERMANY, AND SPAIN, WE OPERATE BOTH AS AN AGENT AND ON A PRINCIPAL BASIS, IN SOME CASES PURCHASING SALVAGE VEHICLES OUTRIGHT AND RESELLING THE VEHICLES FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT. IN GERMANY AND SPAIN, WE ALSO DERIVE REVENUE FROM LISTING VEHICLES ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE EXPERTS TO DETERMINE THE VEHICLE\u2019S RESIDUAL VALUE AND/OR TO FACILITATE A SALE FOR THE INSURED.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE MONITOR AND ANALYZE A NUMBER OF KEY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS AND EVALUATE OUR FINANCIAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE. SUCH INDICATORS INCLUDE.  SERVICE AND VEHICLE SALES REVENUE.  OUR SERVICE REVENUE CONSISTS OF AUCTION AND AUCTION RELATED SALES TRANSACTION FEES CHARGED FOR VEHICLE REMARKETING SERVICES. THESE AUCTION AND AUCTION RELATED SERVICES MAY INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF VEHICLE PURCHASING FEES, VEHICLE LISTING FEES, AND VEHICLE SELLING FEES THAT CAN BE BASED ON A PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF THE VEHICLE SALES PRICE, TIERED VEHICLE SALES PRICE DRIVEN FEES, OR AT A FIXED FEE BASED ON THE SALE OF EACH VEHICLE REGARDLESS OF THE SELLING PRICE OF THE VEHICLE; TRANSPORTATION FEES FOR THE COST OF TRANSPORTING THE VEHICLE TO OR FROM OUR FACILITY; TITLE PROCESSING AND PREPARATION FEES; VEHICLE STORAGE FEES; BIDDING FEES; AND VEHICLE LOADING FEES. THESE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED AS NET REVENUE (NOT GROSS VEHICLE SELLING PRICE) AT THE TIME OF AUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF SUCH FEES CHARGED. PURCHASED VEHICLE REVENUE INCLUDES THE GROSS SALES PRICE OF THE VEHICLES WHICH WE HAVE PURCHASED OR ARE OTHERWISE CONSIDERED TO OWN. WE HAVE CERTAIN CONTRACTS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, PRIMARILY IN THE U.K., IN WHICH WE ACT AS A PRINCIPAL, PURCHASING VEHICLES AND RESELLING THEM FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT. WE ALSO PURCHASE VEHICLES IN THE OPEN MARKET, PRIMARILY FROM INDIVIDUALS, AND RESELL THEM FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT.  OUR REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY AND THE AVERAGE VEHICLE AUCTION SELLING PRICE, AS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SERVICE REVENUE IS ASSOCIATED IN SOME MANNER WITH THE ULTIMATE SELLING PRICE OF THE VEHICLE. VEHICLE AUCTION SELLING PRICES ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY: (I) DOMESTIC AND MARKET DEMAND FOR REBUILDABLE, DRIVABLE VEHICLES; (II) USED CAR PRICING, WHICH WE ALSO BELIEVE HAS AN IMPACT ON TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY; (III) END MARKET DEMAND FOR RECYCLED AND REFURBISHED PARTS AS REFLECTED IN DEMAND FROM DISMANTLERS; (IV) THE MIX OF CARS SOLD; (V) CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE HAS AN IMPACT ON AUCTION PARTICIPATION BY INTERNATIONAL BUYERS; AND (VI) CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, PARTICULARLY THE PER TON PRICE FOR CRUSHED CAR BODIES, AS WE BELIEVE THIS HAS AN IMPACT ON THE ULTIMATE SELLING PRICE OF VEHICLES SOLD FOR SCRAP AND VEHICLES SOLD FOR DISMANTLING. WE CANNOT SPECIFICALLY QUANTIFY THE FINANCIAL IMPACT THAT COMMODITY PRICING, USED CAR PRICING, AND PRODUCT SALES MIX HAS ON THE SELLING PRICE OF VEHICLES, OUR SERVICE REVENUES OR FINANCIAL RESULTS. TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY IS THE PERCENTAGE OF CARS INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES SALVAGE RATHER THAN REPAIR AND IS DRIVEN BY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REPAIR COSTS, USED CAR VALUES, AND AUCTION RETURNS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN OVERALL GROWTH IN THE SALVAGE MARKET DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY MAY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY THE DECLINE IN USED CAR VALUES RELATIVE TO REPAIR COSTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE GENERALLY TRENDING UPWARD. CONVERSELY, INCREASES IN USED CAR PRICES, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING THE MOST RECENT RECESSION, MAY DECREASE TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROWTH RATE. USED CAR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING USED CAR SUPPLY, WHICH IS TIED DIRECTLY TO NEW CAR SALES, AND THE AVERAGE AGE OF CARS ON THE ROAD. THE AVERAGE AGE OF CARS ON THE ROAD CONTINUED TO INCREASE, GROWING FROM 9.6 YEARS IN 2002 TO 11.8 YEARS IN 2019. THE FACTORS THAT CAN INFLUENCE REPAIR COSTS, USED CAR PRICING, AND AUCTION RETURNS ARE MANY AND VARIED AND WE CANNOT PREDICT THEIR MOVEMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE TRENDS IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY.  OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES.  YARD OPERATIONS EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF OPERATING PERSONNEL (WHICH INCLUDES YARD MANAGEMENT, CLERICAL AND YARD EMPLOYEES), RENT, CONTRACT VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION, INSURANCE, FUEL, EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR, AND COSTS OF VEHICLES SOLD UNDER THE PURCHASE CONTRACTS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING, SALES PERSONNEL, HUMAN RESOURCES, PROFESSIONAL FEES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND MARKETING EXPENSES.  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.  OTHER INCOME PRIMARILY INCLUDES INCOME FROM THE RENTAL OF CERTAIN REAL PROPERTY, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE GAINS AND LOSSES, AND GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, WHICH WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THESE ACTIVITIES EACH PERIOD. OTHER EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON LONG-TERM DEBT. SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  3 \u2013 LONG-TERM DEBT.  LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF WORKING CAPITAL IS CASH OPERATING RESULTS AND DEBT FINANCING. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OUR LIQUIDITY IS OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY. THE PRIMARY FACTORS AFFECTING CASH OPERATING RESULTS ARE: (I) SEASONALITY; (II) MARKET WINS AND LOSSES; (III) SUPPLIER MIX; (IV) ACCIDENT FREQUENCY; (V) TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY; (VI) INCREASED VOLUME FROM OUR EXISTING SUPPLIERS; (VII) COMMODITY PRICING; (VIII) USED CAR PRICING; (IX) FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES; (X) PRODUCT MIX; (XI) CONTRACT MIX TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE; AND (XII) OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THESE FACTORS ARE FURTHER DISCUSSED IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND RISK FACTORS SECTIONS OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  POTENTIAL INTERNAL SOURCES OF ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL ARE THE SALE OF ASSETS OR THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES THROUGH OPTION EXERCISES AND SHARES ISSUED UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. A POTENTIAL EXTERNAL SOURCE OF ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL IS THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL DEBT WITH NEW LENDERS AND EQUITY. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT PREDICT IF THESE SOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE OR ON COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TERMS.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ACQUISITIONS AND NEW OPERATIONS  AS PART OF OUR OVERALL EXPANSION STRATEGY OF OFFERING INTEGRATED SERVICES TO VEHICLE SELLERS, WE ANTICIPATE ACQUIRING AND DEVELOPING FACILITIES IN NEW REGIONS, AS WELL AS THE REGIONS CURRENTLY SERVED BY OUR FACILITIES.

IN ADDITION TO GROWTH THROUGH BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, WE SEEK TO INCREASE REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) ACQUIRING AND DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL VEHICLE STORAGE FACILITIES IN KEY MARKETS; (II) PURSUING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL VEHICLE SELLER AGREEMENTS; (III) INCREASING OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS; AND (IV) EXPANDING THE APPLICATION OF VB3 INTO NEW MARKETS. IN ADDITION, WE IMPLEMENT OUR PRICING STRUCTURE AND AUCTION PROCEDURES, AND ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE COST EFFICIENCIES AT EACH OF OUR ACQUIRED FACILITIES BY IMPLEMENTING OUR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES, INTEGRATING OUR MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND REDEPLOYING PERSONNEL, WHEN NECESSARY.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS CERTAIN DATA FROM OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL SERVICE REVENUES AND VEHICLE SALES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  .

THE  INCREASE  IN SERVICE REVENUES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  OF  $93.1 MILLION  , OR  23.6%  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR RESULTED FROM (I)  AN INCREASE  IN THE U.S. OF  $87.2 MILLION  AND (II)  AN INCREASE  IN INTERNATIONAL OF  $5.8 MILLION  . THE GROWTH IN THE U.S. WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY (I) INCREASED VOLUME AND (II) AN INCREASE IN REVENUE PER CAR DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE AUCTION SELLING PRICES, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF VEHICLES SOLD. THE INCREASE IN VOLUME IN THE U.S. WAS DERIVED FROM (I) GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF UNITS SOLD FROM NEW AND EXPANDED CONTRACTS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, AND (II) GROWTH FROM EXISTING SUPPLIERS, DRIVEN BY WHAT WE BELIEVE WAS AN INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY. EXCLUDING THE DETRIMENTAL IMPACT OF $2.3 MILLION DUE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY FROM THE CHANGE IN THE BRITISH POUND AND BRAZILIAN REAL TO U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATES, THE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL OF $8.1 MILLION WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED VOLUME AND HIGHER AVERAGE AUCTION SELLING PRICES.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO PAYMENTS FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED TAX WITHHOLDINGS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES NOT FULLY OFFSET BY CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED PRIMARILY FROM CERTAIN INCOME TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES AND TIMING OF CASH PAYMENTS. CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSISTED OF BANK DEPOSITS, DOMESTIC CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, AND FUNDS INVESTED IN MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS, WHICH BEAR INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES.  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR GROWTH THROUGH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF COMMON STOCK, EQUITY ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT FINANCING. OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS IS FROM THE COLLECTION OF SERVICE FEES AND REIMBURSABLE ADVANCES FROM THE PROCEEDS OF VEHICLE SALES. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO FINANCE OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND TO DEVELOP AND GROW OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION TO OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE ARE CONSIDERING A VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL USES FOR OUR REMAINING CASH BALANCES AND OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. THESE ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL USES INCLUDE ADDITIONAL STOCK REPURCHASES, REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT, THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AND ACQUISITIONS. FOR FURTHER DETAIL, SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  3 \u2013 LONG-TERM DEBT  AND  NOTE  9 \u2013 STOCK REPURCHASES  AND UNDER THE SUBHEADINGS \u201c  CREDIT AGREEMENT  \u201d AND \u201c  NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT  \u201d BELOW.  OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL AS INCLEMENT WEATHER DURING THE WINTER MONTHS INCREASES THE FREQUENCY OF ACCIDENTS AND CONSEQUENTLY, THE NUMBER OF CARS INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS WHICH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SALVAGE RATHER THAN REPAIR. DURING THE WINTER MONTHS, MOST OF OUR FACILITIES PROCESS 10% TO 30% MORE VEHICLES THAN AT OTHER TIMES OF THE YEAR. THIS INCREASED VOLUME REQUIRES THE INCREASED USE OF OUR CASH TO PAY OUT ADVANCES AND HANDLING COSTS OF THE ADDITIONAL BUSINESS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENTLY AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR OPERATING AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE EXPECT TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS AND EXPAND SOME OF OUR CURRENT FACILITIES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CASH THROUGH DRAWDOWNS ON OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY OR ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY TO FUND THIS EXPANSION. ALTHOUGH THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF GROWTH THROUGH EXPANSION AND ACQUISITIONS ARE NOT PREDICTABLE, THE OPENING OF NEW GREENFIELD YARDS IS CONTINGENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE PROPERTY THAT (I) IS IN AN AREA IN WHICH WE HAVE A NEED FOR MORE CAPACITY; (II) HAS ADEQUATE SIZE GIVEN THE CAPACITY NEEDS; (III) HAS THE APPROPRIATE SHAPE AND TOPOGRAPHY FOR OUR OPERATIONS; (IV) IS REASONABLY CLOSE TO A MAJOR ROAD OR HIGHWAY; AND (V) MOST IMPORTANTLY, HAS THE APPROPRIATE ZONING FOR OUR BUSINESS. COSTS TO DEVELOP A NEW YARD CAN RANGE FROM $3.0 TO $50.0 MILLION, DEPENDING ON SIZE, LOCATION AND DEVELOPMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS.  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  ,  $93.3 MILLION  OF THE  $181.1 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IF THESE FUNDS ARE NEEDED FOR OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., THE REPATRIATION OF THESE FUNDS COULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX FOLLOWING THE U.S. TAX REFORM. HOWEVER, OUR INTENT IS TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST THESE FUNDS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND OUR CURRENT PLANS DO NOT REQUIRE REPATRIATION TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONS.  NET CASH  PROVIDED BY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE TO IMPROVED CASH OPERATING RESULTS FROM AN INCREASE IN SERVICE REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN YARD OPERATIONS AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A AN INCREASE OF INCOME TAXES RECEIVABLE OF $44.0 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN FUNDS USED TO PAY ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $37.2 MILLION.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET CASH  USED IN  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO LEASE BUYOUTS OF CERTAIN FACILITIES, ACQUIRING LAND, OPENING AND IMPROVING FACILITIES, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR NEW SOFTWARE FOR INTERNAL USE AND MAJOR SOFTWARE ENHANCEMENTS, AND ACQUIRING YARD EQUIPMENT. WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP, EXPAND AND INVEST IN NEW AND EXISTING FACILITIES AND STANDARDIZE THE APPEARANCE OF EXISTING LOCATIONS.  NET CASH  USED IN  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO PAYMENTS FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK BASED TAX WITHHOLDINGS, AS DISCUSSED IN FURTHER DETAIL UNDER THE SUBHEADING \"  STOCK REPURCHASES  \" PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS.

RETAIL STORES BECOME COMPARABLE ON THE MONDAY FOLLOWING THEIR 365  TH  DAY OF OPERATION. ACQUISITIONS, DIGITAL OR OTHERWISE, ARE INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE SALES AFTER WE OWN THE ACQUIRED ASSETS FOR MORE THAN 52 WEEKS. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDES NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERING SALES THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED FOR MORE THAN 52 WEEKS. COMPARABLE SALES EXCLUDES PRIOR-YEAR SALES OF PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS THAT WE HAVE EXITED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. FISCAL 2019 INCLUDES 52 WEEKS AND FISCAL 2018 INCLUDED 53  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WEEKS. FOR OUR CALCULATION OF COMPARABLE SALES IN FISCAL 2019, WE WILL COMPARE WEEKS 1 THROUGH 52 IN FISCAL 2019 AGAINST WEEKS 2 THROUGH 53 IN FISCAL 2018. COMPARABLE SALES IS INTENDED ONLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET SALES PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES  INCREASED  3.6%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , CONSISTING OF A  1.8%  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET AND A  1.8%  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS. THE  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE SALES REFLECTED A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TRAFFIC GROWTH ACROSS A NUMBER OF OUR CORE CATEGORIES AND THE EXECUTION OF OUR STRATEGIC EFFORTS TO DRIVE AN ENHANCED INTERCONNECTED EXPERIENCE IN BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL WORLDS.  ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS POSTED POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  EXCEPT FOR  ELECTRICAL/LIGHTING AND LUMBER  . COMPARABLE SALES FOR OUR  APPLIANCES, INDOOR GARDEN, DE\u0301COR/STORAGE, HARDWARE, TOOLS, OUTDOOR GARDEN, PAINT, AND PLUMBING  MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS WERE ABOVE THE COMPANY AVERAGE IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . COMPARABLE SALES FOR ELECTRICAL/LIGHTING WERE SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE DUE TO THE LENGTHENING REPLACEMENT CYCLE OF LIGHT BULBS AND COPPER PRICE DEFLATION. COMPARABLE SALES FOR LUMBER WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY COMMODITY PRICE DEFLATION.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COMPARABLE SALES GROWTH AND TOTAL SALES GROWTH IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS DUE TO THE SHIFT IN OUR FISCAL CALENDAR AS A RESULT OF THE 53  RD  WEEK IN FISCAL 2018.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  INCREASED  2.6%  TO  $9.4 BILLION  FROM  $9.2 BILLION  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, OR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN, WAS  34.5%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  34.8%  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . THE  DECREASE  IN GROSS PROFIT MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SHRINK AND A CHANGE IN PRODUCT MIX.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE COMPOSED OF SG&A AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE  . SG&A FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  2.8%  TO  $4.9 BILLION  FROM  $4.8 BILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, SG&A WAS  18.2%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO  18.3%  FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, DRIVEN BY EXPENSE LEVERAGE RESULTING FROM POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES AND CONTINUED EXPENSE CONTROL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXPENSES RELATED TO STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  INCREASED  $25 MILLION  TO  $498 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  FROM  $473 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS  1.8%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND FISCAL  2018  , REFLECTING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS, LEVERAGE RESULTING FROM POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES, AND TIMING OF ASSET ADDITIONS.  INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.  INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, WAS  $280 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  $224 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS  1.0%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  AND  0.9%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  , WITH THE INCREASE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE RESULTING FROM HIGHER DEBT BALANCES.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  OUR COMBINED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS  24.5%  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  21.4%  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NONRECURRING TAX BENEFITS RELATING TO THE TAX ACT AND THE SETTLEMENT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE  $2.53  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  $2.51  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FISCAL  2019  AND FISCAL  2018  NINE  MONTH COMPARISONS  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 3,  2019  OCTOBER 28,  2018  DOLLARS IN MILLIONS  $% OF  NET SALES  $% OF  NET SALES  NET SALES  $84,443  $81,712  GROSS PROFIT  28,836  34.1%  28,133  34.4%  OPERATING EXPENSES.

FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , NET SALES  INCREASED  3.3%  TO  $84.4 BILLION  FROM  $81.7 BILLION  IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET GROWTH AND COMPARABLE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS. ONLINE SALES, WHICH CONSIST OF SALES GENERATED ONLINE THROUGH OUR WEBSITES FOR PRODUCTS PICKED UP IN OUR STORES OR DELIVERED TO CUSTOMER LOCATIONS, REPRESENTED  8.9%  OF NET SALES AND GREW  21.6%  DURING THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SALES GROWTH BY  $146 MILLION  IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.  COMPARABLE SALES  . FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES  INCREASED  3.0%  , CONSISTING OF A  1.9%  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET AND A  1.1%  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS.THIS INCREASE REFLECTED A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TRAFFIC GROWTH ACROSS A NUMBER OF OUR CORE CATEGORIES AND THE EXECUTION OF OUR STRATEGIC EFFORTS TO DRIVE AN ENHANCED INTERCONNECTED EXPERIENCE IN BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL WORLDS. OUR COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET INCREASED  1.9%  FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , DUE IN PART TO BIG TICKET PURCHASES.  DURING THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS EXCEPT FOR LUMBER AND ELECTRICAL/LIGHTING POSTED POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES. COMPARABLE SALES FOR OUR  APPLIANCES, INDOOR GARDEN, DE\u0301COR/STORAGE, TOOLS, HARDWARE,  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUTDOOR GARDEN, PLUMBING, BUILDING MATERIALS, AND PAINT  MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS WERE ABOVE THE COMPANY AVERAGE FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  . COMPARABLE SALES FOR ELECTRICAL/LIGHTING WERE SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE DUE TO THE LENGTHENING REPLACEMENT CYCLE AND PRICE DEFLATION IN LIGHT BULBS. COMPARABLE SALES FOR LUMBER WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY COMMODITY PRICE DEFLATION.  GROSS PROFIT.  FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , GROSS PROFIT  INCREASED  $703 MILLION  TO  $28.8 BILLION  FROM  $28.1 BILLION  IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  .

THE  DECREASE  IN GROSS PROFIT MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SHRINK AND A CHANGE IN PRODUCT MIX.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE COMPOSED OF SG&A AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE  . SG&A  INCREASED  $335 MILLION  TO  $14.9 BILLION  FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  FROM  $14.6 BILLION  IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  .

THE  DECREASE  IN SG&A AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY EXPENSE LEVERAGE RESULTING FROM POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES AND CONTINUED EXPENSE CONTROL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXPENSES RELATED TO STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  . DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  INCREASED  $80 MILLION  TO  $1.5 BILLION  IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  FROM  $1.4 BILLION  IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  .

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  TO PROVIDE CLARITY, INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY, ABOUT OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WE SUPPLEMENT OUR REPORTING WITH CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. HOWEVER, THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED GAAP MEASURES. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED HEREIN MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILAR MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL.  WE BELIEVE ROIC IS MEANINGFUL FOR INVESTORS AND MANAGEMENT BECAUSE IT MEASURES HOW EFFECTIVELY WE DEPLOY OUR CAPITAL BASE. WE DEFINE ROIC AS NOPAT, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, FOR THE MOST RECENT TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD, DIVIDED BY AVERAGE DEBT AND EQUITY. WE DEFINE AVERAGE DEBT AND EQUITY AS THE AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND ENDING LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING CURRENT INSTALLMENTS) AND EQUITY FOR THE MOST RECENT TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE CALCULATION OF ROIC, TOGETHER WITH A RECONCILIATION OF NOPAT TO NET EARNINGS (THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE), FOLLOWS.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  FOR INFORMATION ON ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT HAVE IMPACTED OR ARE EXPECTED TO MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS, SEE  NOTE 1  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  AT  NOVEMBER 3, 2019  , WE HAD  $2.2 BILLION  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, OF WHICH  $1.8 BILLION  WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH POSITION, ACCESS TO THE LONG-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, AND FUNDS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT NOT ONLY FOR OUR OPERATING REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO TO ENABLE US TO COMPLETE OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS AND FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SHARE REPURCHASES, AND ANY REQUIRED LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL FISCAL YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING.  AS WE CONTINUE OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS, WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY  $2.7 BILLION  IN FISCAL  2019.  DEBT AND DERIVATIVES  WE HAVE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION. ALL OF OUR SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  WERE UNDER THESE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS, AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME WAS  $2.1 BILLION  . IN CONNECTION WITH THESE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITIES WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO $3.0 BILLION, WHICH CONSIST OF A FIVE-YEAR $2.0 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN DECEMBER 2022 AND A 364-DAY $1.0 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN DECEMBER 2019. AT  NOVEMBER 3, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITIES, AND NONE ARE EXPECTED TO IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES. AT  NOVEMBER 3, 2019  ,  $695 MILLION  WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS. WE ALSO ISSUE SENIOR NOTES FROM TIME TO TIME AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY.  WE USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES ON CERTAIN LONG-TERM DEBT. SEE  NOTE 4  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR SENIOR NOTES ISSUANCES AND OUR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  SHARE REPURCHASES  IN FEBRUARY 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW $15.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT REPLACED THE PREVIOUS AUTHORIZATION. IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , WE HAD CASH PAYMENTS OF  $3.9 BILLION  FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK THROUGH ASR AGREEMENTS AND OPEN MARKET PURCHASES.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOWS SUMMARY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS PROVIDES US WITH A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS RESULT PRIMARILY FROM CASH RECEIVED FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, OFFSET BY CASH PAYMENTS WE MAKE FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, OPERATIONS, AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  CASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL. WORKING CAPITAL AT ANY POINT IN TIME IS SUBJECT TO MANY VARIABLES, INCLUDING SEASONALITY, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND CATEGORY EXPANSION, THE TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS, VENDOR PAYMENT TERMS, AND FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $628 MILLION  IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  AND WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FROM THE CONTINUATION OF OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN OUR BUSINESS OF  $1.9 BILLION  DURING THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  $1.7 BILLION  OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED.  \u2022  $4.5 BILLION  OF CASH DIVIDENDS PAID,  $3.9 BILLION  OF SHARE REPURCHASES,  $1.0 BILLION  OF NET REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT, AND  $644 MILLION  OF NET REPAYMENTS OF SHORT-TERM DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  $1.4 BILLION  OF NET PROCEEDS FROM LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , AND  \u2022  $5.5 BILLION  OF SHARE REPURCHASES,  $3.5 BILLION  OF CASH DIVIDENDS PAID, AND  $1.2 BILLION  OF NET REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d AND THOSE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN OUR OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (\"GAAP\").  THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.  THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS AFFECTING THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  ON A REGULAR BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO TOTAL COSTS ON LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION-TYPE CONTRACTS, COSTS TO BE INCURRED FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND EXTENDED MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS, BAD DEBTS, EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY, INCOME TAXES, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AND CONTINGENCIES.  OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.  ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  OVERVIEW  WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SELL A WIDE RANGE OF DISPLAY SYSTEMS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  WE FOCUS OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS ON MARKETS, GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS AND PRODUCTS.  OUR FIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS CONSIST OF FOUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS UNITS AND THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT.  THE FOUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS UNITS CONSIST OF COMMERCIAL, LIVE EVENTS, HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION, AND TRANSPORTATION, ALL OF WHICH INCLUDE THE GEOGRAPHIC TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.  DISCLOSURES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE PROVIDED IN \"  NOTE 5. SEGMENT REPORTING  \" OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.  OUR NET SALES AND PROFITABILITY HISTORICALLY HAVE FLUCTUATED DUE TO THE IMPACT OF UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS, SUCH AS DISPLAY SYSTEMS FOR PROFESSIONAL SPORTS FACILITIES, COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, AND SPECTACULAR PROJECTS IN THE COMMERCIAL AREA, AS WELL AS THE SEASONALITY OF THE SPORTS MARKET.  UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS CAN INCLUDE SEVERAL DISPLAYS, CONTROLLERS, AND SUBCONTRACTED STRUCTURE BUILDS, EACH OF WHICH CAN OCCUR ON VARIED SCHEDULES PER THE CUSTOMER'S NEEDS.  OUTDOOR INSTALLATION SALES CAN BE IMPACTED BY OUTDOOR WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE CONSTRUCTION SEASON.  OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER TENDS TO BE A SLOWER QUARTER BECAUSE IT INCLUDES TWO HOLIDAYS, IT IS AFFECTED BY SPORTS SEASONALITY, AND GENERALLY LESS OUTDOOR CONSTRUCTION WORK OCCURS DUE TO WEATHER CONDITIONS.  OUR GROSS MARGINS TEND TO FLUCTUATE MORE ON UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS THAN ON LIMITED CONFIGURED ORDERS.  UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS INVOLVING COMPETITIVE BIDDING AND SUBSTANTIAL SUBCONTRACT WORK FOR PRODUCT INSTALLATION GENERALLY HAVE LOWER GROSS MARGINS.  ALTHOUGH WE FOLLOW THE OVER TIME METHOD OF RECOGNIZING REVENUES FOR UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS, WE NEVERTHELESS HAVE EXPERIENCED FLUCTUATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS AND EXPECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR FLUCTUATIONS.  OUR REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS (\"BACKLOG\") CONSIST OF CONTRACTUALLY BINDING SALES AGREEMENTS OR PURCHASE ORDERS FOR INTEGRATED ELECTRONIC DISPLAY SYSTEMS AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICE.  ORDERS ARE INCLUDED IN BACKLOG WHEN WE ARE IN RECEIPT OF AN EXECUTED CONTRACT AND ANY REQUIRED DEPOSITS OR SECURITY.  AS A RESULT, CERTAIN ORDERS FOR WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED BINDING LETTERS OF INTENT OR CONTRACTS WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN BACKLOG UNTIL ALL REQUIRED CONTRACTUAL DOCUMENTS AND DEPOSITS ARE RECEIVED.  BACKLOG CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO LARGE ORDER BOOKINGS AND THE TIMING AND SEASONALITY OF NET SALES.  BECAUSE ORDER BACKLOG FLUCTUATES AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO EXTENDED DELIVERY SCHEDULES, ORDERS MAY BE CANCELED AND HAVE VARIED ESTIMATED PROFITABILITY.  OUR BACKLOG IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE NET SALES OR NET INCOME.  BACKLOG IS NOT A MEASURE DEFINED BY GAAP, AND OUR METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING BACKLOG MAY VARY FROM THE METHODOLOGY USED BY OTHER COMPANIES IN DETERMINING THEIR BACKLOG AMOUNTS.  GENERAL  OUR MISSION IS TO BE THE WORLD LEADER AT INFORMING AND ENTERTAINING AUDIENCES THROUGH DYNAMIC AUDIO-VISUAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS.  WE ORGANIZE INTO BUSINESS UNITS TO FOCUS ON CUSTOMER LOYALTY OVER TIME TO EARN NEW AND REPLACEMENT BUSINESS BECAUSE OUR PRODUCTS HAVE A FINITE LIFETIME.  SEE \"  NOTE 5. SEGMENT REPORTING  \" OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  OUR STRATEGIES INCLUDE THE CREATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE LINE OF INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS AND SYSTEMS AND OUR ABILITY TO CREATE AND LEVERAGE PLATFORM DESIGNS AND TECHNOLOGIES.  THESE STRATEGIES ALIGN US TO EFFECTIVELY DELIVER VALUE TO OUR VARIED CUSTOMERS AND THEIR MARKET NEEDS, WHILE SERVING OUR STAKEHOLDERS OVER THE LONG-TERM.  WE FOCUS ON CREATING LOCAL CAPABILITIES FOR SALES, SERVICE, AND MANUFACTURING IN GEOGRAPHIES WITH EXPECTED DIGITAL MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.  WE BELIEVE CONSISTENTLY GENERATING PROFITABLE GROWTH WILL PROVIDE VALUE TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS (CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, SHAREHOLDERS, SUPPLIERS, AND COMMUNITIES).  WE MEASURE OUR SUCCESS USING A VARIETY OF MEASURES INCLUDING.  \u2022  OUR PERCENTAGE OF MARKET SHARE BY COMPARING OUR ESTIMATED REVENUE TO THE TOTAL ESTIMATED GLOBAL DIGITAL DISPLAY REVENUE,  \u2022  OUR ORDER GROWTH COMPARED TO THE OVERALL DIGITAL MARKET ORDER CHANGE,  \u2022  FINANCIAL METRICS SUCH AS ANNUAL ORDER VOLUME AND PROFIT CHANGE AS COMPARED TO OUR PREVIOUS FINANCIAL RESULTS,  \u2022  CUSTOMER RETENTION AND EXPANSION RATES, AND  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE PROFITS OVER THE LONG-TERM TO PROVIDE A SHAREHOLDER RETURN.  CERTAIN FACTORS IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN THESE STRATEGIES AND IMPACT OUR BUSINESS UNITS TO VARYING DEGREES.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE OVERALL COST TO MANUFACTURE AND THE SELLING PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS HAVE DECREASED OVER THE YEARS AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO DECREASE IN THE FUTURE.  OUR COMPETITORS OUTSIDE THE U.S. ARE IMPACTED DIFFERENTLY BY THE GLOBAL TRADE ENVIRONMENT ALLOWING THEM TO AVOID TARIFF COSTS OR REDUCE PRICES.  AS A RESULT, ADDITIONAL COMPETITORS HAVE ENTERED THE MARKET, AND EACH YEAR WE MUST SELL MORE PRODUCT TO GENERATE THE SAME OR GREATER LEVEL OF NET SALES AS IN PREVIOUS FISCAL YEARS.  HOWEVER, THE DECLINE OF DIGITAL SOLUTION PRICING OVER THE YEARS AND INCREASED USER ADOPTION AND APPLICATIONS HAVE INCREASED THE SIZE OF THE GLOBAL MARKET.  COMPETITOR OFFERINGS, ACTIONS AND REACTIONS ALSO CAN VARY AND CHANGE OVER TIME OR IN CERTAIN CUSTOMER SITUATIONS.  PROJECTS WITH MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR REVENUE POTENTIAL ATTRACTS COMPETITION, AND COMPETITORS CAN USE MARKETING OR OTHER TACTICS TO WIN BUSINESS.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EACH OF OUR BUSINESS UNIT'S LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE CAN BE IMPACTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND TO DIFFERENT DEGREES.  THE EFFECTS OF AN ADVERSE ECONOMY ARE GENERALLY LESS SEVERE ON OUR SPORTS RELATED BUSINESS AS COMPARED TO OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, ALTHOUGH IN SEVERE ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, THE SPORTS BUSINESS CAN ALSO BE SERIOUSLY IMPACTED.  WE CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT-TERM EVENTS LIKE THE U.S. ADMINISTRATIVE TRADE ACTIONS IN 2018 OR A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE DISCLOSED IN \"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\" INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  APRIL 27, 2019.  THE OUTLOOK AND UNIQUE KEY GROWTH DRIVERS AND CHALLENGES BY OUR BUSINESS UNITS INCLUDE.  COMMERCIAL BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  STANDARD DISPLAY PRODUCT MARKET GROWTH DUE TO MARKET ADOPTION AND LOWER PRODUCT COSTS, WHICH DRIVE MARKETPLACE EXPANSION.  STANDARD DISPLAY PRODUCTS ARE USED TO ATTRACT OR COMMUNICATE WITH CUSTOMERS AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS OF RETAIL, COMMERCIAL, AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS.  PRICING AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS THAT IMPACT OUR SUCCESS IN THIS BUSINESS UNIT.  WE UTILIZE A RESELLER NETWORK TO DISTRIBUTE OUR STANDARD PRODUCTS.  \u2022  NATIONAL ACCOUNTS STANDARD DISPLAY MARKET OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO CUSTOMERS' DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE THEIR MESSAGE, ADVERTISING AND CONTENT CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  INCREASED DEMAND IS POSSIBLE FROM NATIONAL RETAILERS, QUICK SERVE RESTAURANTS, PETROLEUM RETAILERS, AND OTHER NATIONWIDE ORGANIZATIONS.  \u2022  ADDITIONAL STANDARD DISPLAY OFFERINGS USING MICRO-LIGHT EMITTING DIODE (\"LED\") DESIGNS.  \u2022  INCREASING USE OF LED TECHNOLOGIES REPLACING SIGNAGE PREVIOUSLY USING LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY (\"LCD\") TECHNOLOGY BY EXISTING AND NEW CUSTOMERS.  \u2022  INCREASING INTEREST IN SPECTACULARS, WHICH INCLUDE VERY LARGE AND SOMETIMES HIGHLY CUSTOMIZED DISPLAYS AS PART OF ENTERTAINMENT VENUES SUCH AS CASINOS, SHOPPING CENTERS, CRUISE SHIPS AND TIMES SQUARE TYPE LOCATIONS.  \u2022  DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS DEMAND GROWTH DUE TO MARKET ADOPTION AND EXPANDED USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY.  \u2022  THE USE OF ARCHITECTURAL LIGHTING PRODUCTS FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, WHICH REAL ESTATE OWNERS USE TO ADD ACCENTS OR EFFECTS TO AN ENTIRE SIDE OR CIRCUMFERENCE OF A BUILDING TO COMMUNICATE MESSAGES OR TO DECORATE THE BUILDING.  \u2022  THE CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF DIGITAL BILLBOARDS AS OUT-OF-HOME (\"OOH\") ADVERTISING COMPANIES CONTINUE DEVELOPING NEW SITES AND REPLACING DIGITAL BILLBOARDS REACHING END OF LIFE.  THIS IS DEPENDENT ON NO ADVERSE CHANGES OCCURRING IN THE DIGITAL BILLBOARD REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RESTRICTING FUTURE BILLBOARD DEPLOYMENTS, AS WELL AS MAINTAINING OUR CURRENT MARKET SHARE IN A BUSINESS THAT IS CONCENTRATED IN A FEW LARGE OOH COMPANIES.  \u2022  REPLACEMENT CYCLES WITHIN EACH OF THESE AREAS.  LIVE EVENTS BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE LIVE EVENTS BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  FACILITIES SPENDING MORE ON LARGER DISPLAY SYSTEMS TO ENHANCE THE GAME-DAY AND EVENT EXPERIENCE FOR ATTENDEES.  \u2022  LOWER PRODUCT COSTS, DRIVING AN EXPANSION OF THE MARKETPLACE.  \u2022  OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL MICRO-LED OFFERINGS WHICH REMAIN THE MOST INTEGRATED AND COMPREHENSIVE OFFERINGS IN THE INDUSTRY.  \u2022  THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF SPORTS TEAMS, WHICH STRIVE TO OUT-PERFORM THEIR COMPETITORS WITH DISPLAY SYSTEMS.  \u2022  THE DESIRE FOR HIGH-DEFINITION VIDEO DISPLAYS, WHICH TYPICALLY DRIVES LARGER DISPLAYS OR HIGHER RESOLUTION DISPLAYS, BOTH OF WHICH INCREASE THE AVERAGE TRANSACTION SIZE.  \u2022  DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEM NEEDS THROUGHOUT A SPORTS FACILITY.  \u2022  INCREASING USE OF LED TECHNOLOGIES REPLACING SIGNAGE PREVIOUSLY USING LCD TECHNOLOGY IN AND SURROUNDING LIVE EVENTS FACILITIES.  \u2022  REPLACEMENT CYCLES WITHIN EACH OF THESE AREAS.  HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  INCREASED DEMAND FOR VIDEO SYSTEMS IN HIGH SCHOOLS AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS REALIZE THE REVENUE GENERATING POTENTIAL OF THESE DISPLAYS COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL SCOREBOARDS AND THESE SYSTEMS' ABILITY TO PROVIDE OR ENHANCE ACADEMIC CURRICULUM OFFERINGS FOR STUDENTS.  \u2022  INCREASED DEMAND FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISPLAYS AND DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS, SUCH AS MESSAGE CENTERS AT SCHOOLS TO COMMUNICATE TO STUDENTS, PARENTS AND THE BROADER COMMUNITY.  \u2022  LOWER SYSTEM COSTS DRIVING THE USE OF MORE SOPHISTICATED DISPLAYS IN SCHOOL ATHLETIC FACILITIES, SUCH AS LARGE INTEGRATED VIDEO SYSTEMS.  \u2022  EXPANDING CONTROL SYSTEM OPTIONS TAILORED FOR THE MARKETS' NEEDS.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM INCREASING APPLICATIONS AND ACCEPTANCE OF ELECTRONIC DISPLAYS TO MANAGE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, INCLUDING ROADWAY, AIRPORT, PARKING, TRANSIT AND OTHER APPLICATIONS.  EFFECTIVE USE OF THE UNITED STATES TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRES INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS.  THIS GROWTH IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT SPENDING, PRIMARILY BY STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS, ALONG WITH THE CONTINUING ACCEPTANCE OF PRIVATE/PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS AS AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE.  GROWTH IS ALSO EXPECTED IN DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS FOR ADVERTISING AND WAY-FINDING USE IN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND AIRPORT TERMINALS DUE TO EXPANDED MARKET USAGE AND DISPLAYS, WITH LED TECHNOLOGY REPLACING PRIOR LCD INSTALLATIONS AND ADDITIONAL DISPLAY OFFERINGS USING MICRO-LEDS.  INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM ACHIEVING GREATER PENETRATION IN VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIES AND BUILDING PRODUCTS MORE SUITED TO INDIVIDUAL MARKETS.  WE CONTINUE TO BROADEN OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS INTO THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT IN EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST.  WE ALSO FOCUS ON SPORTS FACILITY, SPECTACULAR-TYPE, OOH ADVERTISING PRODUCTS, AND ARCHITECTURAL LIGHTING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND THE FACTORS LISTED IN EACH OF THE OTHER BUSINESS UNITS TO THE EXTENT THEY APPLY OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.  ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES EXIST WITH EXPANDED MARKET USAGE OF LED TECHNOLOGY DUE TO PRICE CONSIDERATIONS, USAGE OF LED TECHNOLOGY REPLACING PRIOR LCD INSTALLATIONS AND ADDITIONAL DISPLAY OFFERINGS USING MICRO-LEDS.

THEREFORE, THE LOAN AGREEMENT AND RELATED REVOLVING NOTE AND GUARANTY EXPIRED AND TERMINATED ACCORDING TO THEIR TERMS ON NOVEMBER 15, 2019, AND WE HAVE NO CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITY UNDER THIS LOAN AGREEMENT, REVOLVING NOTE, AND GUARANTY.  WE ARE SOMETIMES REQUIRED TO OBTAIN BANK GUARANTEES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR DISPLAY INSTALLATIONS AND WE HAVE A GLOBAL BANKING RELATIONSHIP TO PROVIDE SUCH INSTRUMENTS.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET THE TERMS OF THE ARRANGEMENT, OUR CUSTOMER WOULD DRAW ON THE BANKING ARRANGEMENT, AND THE BANK WOULD SUBROGATE ITS LOSS TO DAKTRONICS.

FOR MORE DETAIL REGARDING THE JANUARY 1, 2019 ADOPTION OF  ASU 2016-02, \u201cLEASES (TOPIC 842),\u201d REFER TO  NOTE  R  \u201cLEASES\u201d AND NOTE K \u201cRECENTLY  ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.\u201d  WORKING CAPITAL, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT OF LIQUIDITY  WE MEASURE LIQUIDITY ON THE BASIS OF OUR ABILITY TO MEET SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM OPERATING NEEDS, REPAY DEBT, FUND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS, AND MAKE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO SHAREHOLDERS. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING THE MANAGEMENT OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH DIVIDENDS, BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND ACCESS TO BANK LINES OF CREDIT.  OUR INVESTMENTS INCLUDE EXPENDITURES REQUIRED FOR EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES AS WELL AS EXPENDITURES IN SUPPORT OF OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, WE USED CASH OF $22.0 MILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE ENDED THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 WITH $41.5 MILLION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH (\u201cCASH\u201d). OUR CASH IS HELD IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE MAJORITY OF OUR CASH WAS HELD OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES (\u201cU.S.\u201d).  WE EXPECT MOST ACCUMULATED NON-U.S. CASH BALANCES WILL REMAIN OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND THAT WE WILL MEET U.S. LIQUIDITY NEEDS THROUGH FUTURE CASH FLOWS, USE OF U.S. CASH BALANCES, EXTERNAL BORROWINGS, OR SOME COMBINATION OF THESE SOURCES. WE COMPLETE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS OF OUR SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND THEIR CREDITWORTHINESS BY ANALYZING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR CUSTOMERS WHERE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A MEASURE OF INCREASED RISK. WE CLOSELY MONITOR PAYMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS WHICH MAY SIGNAL POSSIBLE CUSTOMER CREDIT ISSUES. WE CURRENTLY HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY POTENTIAL MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY FROM CUSTOMER CREDIT ISSUES.  TOTAL DEBT AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $63.0 MILLION.  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR UNUSED AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR LINE OF CREDIT WAS $32.9 MILLION AND OUR BANK DEBT TO EQUITY PERCENTAGE WAS 24.3%.  IN 2018, WE EXTENDED THE TERM ON OUR $65 MILLION CREDIT FACILITY FROM JUNE 30, 2019 TO JUNE 30, 2021.  ALL OTHER TERMS REMAIN THE SAME, INCLUDING THE INTEREST RATE AT LIBOR PLUS 1.125% UNLESS OUR FUNDED DEBT TO EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES AND DEPRECIATION RATIO EXCEEDS 2.25 TO 1, AT WHICH POINT THE LIBOR SPREAD BECOMES 1.500%.  THE LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS, AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS, REQUIREMENTS FOR MAINTAINING LEVELS OF NET WORTH AND FUNDED DEBT-TO-EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ALONG WITH AN INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO. THE NET WORTH AND PROFITABILITY REQUIREMENTS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON THE LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS.  WE EXPECT THAT OUR MAJOR SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR 2019 AND BEYOND WILL BE OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS, OUR EXISTING CASH AS WELL AS OUR LINE OF CREDIT AGREEMENT. WE EARN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OPERATING INCOME OUTSIDE THE U.S., WHICH, EXCEPT FOR CURRENT EARNINGS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, IS DEEMED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.  WE BELIEVE OUR FUTURE OPERATING CASH FLOWS WILL BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO COVER DEBT REPAYMENTS, OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND DIVIDENDS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE OUR BORROWING CAPACITY PROVIDES SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES, IF NEEDED, TO SUPPLEMENT FUNDING OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND/OR ACQUISITIONS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN EXPAND OUR BORROWING CAPACITY, IF NECESSARY; HOWEVER, WE DO NOT BELIEVE WE WOULD INCREASE OUR DEBT TO A LEVEL THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT UPON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH  CASH INCREASED $7.1 MILLION COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $20.7 MILLION. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NET INVESTING AND FINANCING USES OF CASH IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE PAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $41.6 MILLION, CASH USED TO FUND THE ACQUISITION OF SUBCON AND MICOS TELCOM OF $18.9 MILLION, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $22.0 MILLION, SHARE REPURCHASES OF $4.5 MILLION AND DIVIDENDS PAID OF $3.2 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE PROCEEDS OF $69.3 MILLION.

NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018 WAS $20.7 MILLION COMPARED TO $7.1 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  THE $13.6 MILLION INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF A DECREASE IN CASH USAGE FOR OPERATING ASSETS (NET OF OPERATING LIABILITIES) OF $16.7 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED A REDUCTION RESULTING FROM THE $5.3 MILLION CONTRIBUTION TO THE PENSION PLAN IN 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NET INCOME OF $3.6 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN NON-CASH ITEMS OF $.5 MILLION.  32  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $41.  3  MILLION FOR THE  NINE MONTHS  ENDED  SEPTEMBER  30  , 2019 INCREASED $29.  3  MILLION WHEN COMPARED TO CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE  NINE MONTHS  ENDED  SEPTEMBER  30  , 2018 OF $1  2.  0  MILLION. THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO CASH USED TO FUND THE SUB  C  ON  AND MICOS  TELCOM  ACQUISITION  S  , NET OF CASH, OF $1  8.9  MILLION  AND A YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $14.  7  MILLION  , PARTIALLY OFFS  ET BY A REDUCTION IN CASH USED YEAR-OVER YEAR TO PURCHASE MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $4.2  MILLION  IN 2018.  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $20.0 MILLION COMPARED TO A CASH USAGE OF $4.8 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE $24.8 MILLION IMPROVEMENT WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A NET INCREASE IN DEBT BORROWINGS IN 2019 COMPARED TO 2018 OF $26.4 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN CASH USED FOR NET STOCK REPURCHASES OF $1.5 MILLION.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. THE DISCLOSURES IN THIS REPORT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO THOSE MADE IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  OVERVIEW  PENNSYLVANIA REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST, A PENNSYLVANIA BUSINESS TRUST FOUNDED IN 1960 AND ONE OF THE FIRST EQUITY REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\u201cREITS\u201d) IN THE UNITED STATES, HAS A PRIMARY INVESTMENT FOCUS ON RETAIL SHOPPING MALLS LOCATED IN THE EASTERN HALF OF THE UNITED STATES, PRIMARILY IN THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION.  WE CURRENTLY OWN INTERESTS IN 26 RETAIL PROPERTIES, OF WHICH 25 ARE OPERATING PROPERTIES AND ONE IS A DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY. THE 25 OPERATING PROPERTIES INCLUDE 21 SHOPPING MALLS AND FOUR OTHER RETAIL PROPERTIES, HAVE A TOTAL OF 19.5 MILLION SQUARE FEET AND ARE LOCATED IN NINE STATES. WE AND PARTNERSHIPS IN WHICH WE HOLD AN INTEREST OWN 15.2 MILLION SQUARE FEET AT THESE PROPERTIES (EXCLUDING SPACE OWNED BY ANCHORS OR THIRD PARTIES).  THERE ARE 18 OPERATING RETAIL PROPERTIES IN OUR PORTFOLIO THAT WE CONSOLIDATE FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. THESE CONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES HAVE A TOTAL OF 15.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH WE OWN 12.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET. THE SEVEN OPERATING RETAIL PROPERTIES THAT ARE OWNED BY UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES HAVE A TOTAL OF 4.5 MILLION SQUARE FEET, OF WHICH 3.2 MILLION SQUARE FEET ARE OWNED BY SUCH PARTNERSHIPS. WHEN WE REFER TO \u201cSAME STORE\u201d PROPERTIES, WE ARE REFERRING TO PROPERTIES THAT HAVE BEEN OWNED FOR THE FULL PERIODS PRESENTED AND EXCLUDE PROPERTIES ACQUIRED, DISPOSED OF, UNDER REDEVELOPMENT OR DESIGNATED AS A NON-CORE PROPERTY DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. CORE PROPERTIES INCLUDE ALL OPERATING RETAIL PROPERTIES EXCEPT FOR EXTON SQUARE MALL, VALLEY VIEW MALL AND FASHION DISTRICT PHILADELPHIA, WHICH OPENED IN SEPTEMBER 2019 AND IS NOT YET STABILIZED AS DEVELOPMENT WORK IS CONTINUING. \u201cCORE MALLS\u201d ALSO EXCLUDES THESE PROPERTIES AS WELL AS POWER CENTERS AND GLOUCESTER PREMIUM OUTLETS. WYOMING VALLEY MALL WAS CONVEYED TO THE LENDER OF THE MORTGAGE LOAN SECURED BY THAT PROPERTY IN SEPTEMBER 2019. WE HAVE ONE UNDEVELOPED LAND PARCEL LOCATED IN GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA, A PORTION OF WHICH WAS SOLD IN MARCH 2019.  WE HAVE ONE PROPERTY IN OUR PORTFOLIO THAT IS CLASSIFIED AS UNDER DEVELOPMENT; HOWEVER, WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ANY ACTIVITY OCCURRING AT THIS PROPERTY.  OUR PRIMARY BUSINESS IS OWNING AND OPERATING RETAIL SHOPPING MALLS, WHICH WE DO PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, PREIT ASSOCIATES, L.P. (\u201cPREIT ASSOCIATES\u201d OR THE \u201cOPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u201d). WE PROVIDE MANAGEMENT, LEASING AND REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT SERVICES THROUGH PREIT SERVICES, LLC (\u201cPREIT SERVICES\u201d), WHICH GENERALLY DEVELOPS AND MANAGES PROPERTIES THAT WE CONSOLIDATE FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, AND PREIT-RUBIN, INC. (\u201cPRI\u201d), WHICH GENERALLY DEVELOPS AND MANAGES PROPERTIES THAT WE DO NOT CONSOLIDATE FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, INCLUDING PROPERTIES OWNED BY PARTNERSHIPS IN WHICH WE OWN AN INTEREST AND PROPERTIES THAT ARE OWNED BY THIRD PARTIES IN WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE AN INTEREST. PRI IS A TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARY, AS DEFINED BY FEDERAL TAX LAWS, WHICH MEANS THAT IT IS ABLE TO OFFER ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO TENANTS WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING OUR CONTINUING QUALIFICATION AS A REIT UNDER FEDERAL TAX LAW.  OUR REVENUE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF FIXED RENTAL INCOME, ADDITIONAL RENT IN THE FORM OF FIXED AND VARIABLE EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS, AND PERCENTAGE RENT (RENT THAT IS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF OUR TENANTS\u2019 SALES OR A PERCENTAGE OF SALES IN EXCESS OF THRESHOLDS THAT ARE SPECIFIED IN THE LEASES) DERIVED FROM OUR INCOME PRODUCING PROPERTIES. WE ALSO RECEIVE INCOME FROM OUR REAL ESTATE PARTNERSHIP INVESTMENTS AND FROM THE MANAGEMENT AND LEASING SERVICES PRI PROVIDES.  NET INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $24.7 MILLION COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $1.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THIS $26.4 MILLION CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTS A GAIN ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT OF $29.6 MILLION AND INSURANCE RECOVERIES OF $2.9 MILLION RECORDED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY: (A) A $3.5 MILLION DECREASE IN SAME STORE NOI; (B) A $2.2 MILLION DECREASE IN NON SAME STORE NOI; (C) A $2.2 MILLION INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $1.2 MILLION DECREASE IN CAPITALIZED LEASING COSTS AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF ASC 842 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019; AND (D) A $1.2 MILLION DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME PRIMARILY DUE TO HISTORIC TAX CREDIT REVENUES RECORDED IN THE 2018 PERIOD, WHICH DID NOT RECUR IN THE 2019 PERIOD, AND LOWER CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP REVENUES COMPARED TO THE 2018 PERIOD.  NET INCOME FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $2.4 MILLION COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $37.7 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THIS $40.1 MILLION CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTS A NET GAIN ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT OF $24.8 MILLION, INSURANCE RECOVERIES OF $4.5 MILLION, AND IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS OF $34.3 MILLION RECORDED IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WHICH DID NOT RECUR IN THE 2019 PERIOD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY: (A) A $10.3 MILLION DECREASE IN SAME STORE NOI, INCLUDING A $6.6 MILLION DECREASE IN LEASE TERMINATION REVENUES; (B) A $5.5 MILLION DECREASE IN NON SAME STORE NOI; (C) A $5.4 MILLION INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $3.9 MILLION DECREASE IN CAPITALIZED LEASING COSTS AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF ASC 842 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019; (D) A $2.0 MILLION DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME PRIMARILY DUE TO HISTORIC TAX CREDIT REVENUES RECORDED IN THE 2018 PERIOD, WHICH DID NOT RECUR IN THE 2019 PERIOD, AND LOWER CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP REVENUES AND LOWER FEES FROM MANAGEMENT AND LEASING FEES PROVIDED TO THIRD-PARTIES COMPARED TO THE 2018 PERIOD; AND (E) A $1.5 MILLION IMPAIRMENT OF A LAND PARCEL RECORDED IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SEE \u201cNON-GAAP SUPPLEMENTAL  FINANCIAL MEASURES  \u201d BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR USE OF  SAME STORE NOI AND  N  ON  SAME STORE NOI,  WHICH  A  RE  NON-GAAP MEASURE  S.  WE EVALUATE OPERATING RESULTS AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES ON A PROPERTY-BY-PROPERTY BASIS, AND DO NOT DISTINGUISH OR EVALUATE OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF OUR OPERATING PROPERTIES, WHICH INVOLVE RETAIL SHOPPING, WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT OUR INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND MEET ALL OTHER AGGREGATION CRITERIA. ACCORDINGLY, WE  HAVE AGGREGATED OUR INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES INTO ONE REPORTABLE SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, NO SINGLE TENANT ACCOUNTS FOR 10% OR MORE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUE, AND NONE OF OUR PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.  CURRENT ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY CONDITIONS  CONDITIONS IN THE ECONOMY HAVE CAUSED FLUCTUATIONS AND VARIATIONS IN BUSINESS AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, RETAIL SALES, AND CONSUMER SPENDING ON RETAIL GOODS. FURTHER, TRADITIONAL MALL TENANTS, INCLUDING DEPARTMENT STORE ANCHORS AND SMALLER FORMAT RETAIL TENANTS, FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES RESULTING FROM CHANGING CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS, THE CONVENIENCE OF E-COMMERCE SHOPPING, COMPETITION FROM FAST FASHION RETAILERS, THE EXPANSION OF OUTLET CENTERS, AND DECLINING MALL TRAFFIC, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.  IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASED LEVEL OF TENANT BANKRUPTCIES AND STORE CLOSINGS BY TENANTS WHO HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THESE FACTORS.  THOUGH WE OPENED CERTAIN TENANTS AT OUR REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, INCLUDING AT FASHION DISTRICT PHILADELPHIA AND PLYMOUTH MEETING MALL, AND EXPECT ADDITIONAL TENANT OPENINGS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 AND THROUGHOUT 2020, WE ALSO HAVE TENANTS WHO CONTINUE TO FACE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC CHALLENGES, AND WE ARE IN ACTIVE DISCUSSIONS TO RESTRUCTURE CERTAIN LEASING ARRANGEMENTS THROUGH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DOWNSIZING AND RENT RELIEF, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO IMPACT OUR RESULTS UNFAVORABLY.

ANCHOR REPLACEMENTS  IN RECENT YEARS, THROUGH PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS, PROACTIVE STORE RECAPTURES, LEASE TERMINATIONS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES, WE HAVE MADE EFFORTS TO REDUCE OUR RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN DEPARTMENT STORE CONCENTRATIONS AND HAVE IMPLEMENTED OUR ONGOING ANCHOR REPLACEMENT PROGRAM. IN DECEMBER 2016, WE ACQUIRED THE SEARS PROPERTY AT WOODLAND MALL AND IN 2017 WE RECAPTURED THE SEARS PREMISES AT CAPITAL CITY MALL AND MAGNOLIA MALL (WE HAVE SINCE RE-LEASED THE CAPITAL CITY MALL AND MAGNOLIA MALL SPACES). ALSO IN 2017, WE PURCHASED THE MACY\u2019S LOCATIONS AT MOORESTOWN MALL, VALLEY VIEW MALL AND VALLEY MALL LOCATIONS AND WE RE-LEASED ALL OF THESE FORMER MACY\u2019S STORES. THE REPLACEMENT TENANT FOR MACY\u2019S AT VALLEY VIEW MALL FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY AND SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED THAT STORE. WE TERMINATED THE LEASE OF THE SEARS STORE AT DARTMOUTH MALL EFFECTIVE IN 2019 AND HAVE ENTERED INTO A LEASE FOR A REPLACEMENT TENANT. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A GROUND LEASE FOR THE LAND ASSOCIATED WITH THE MACY\u2019S STORE LOCATED AT PLYMOUTH MEETING MALL AND HAVE EXECUTED LEASES WITH FIVE REPLACEMENT TENANTS FOR THAT LOCATION.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE TABLE BELOW SETS FORTH INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR ANCHOR REPLACEMENT PROGRAM.

IN RESPONSE TO ANCHOR STORE CLOSINGS AND OTHER TRENDS IN THE RETAIL SPACE, WE HAVE BEEN CHANGING THE MIX OF TENANTS AT OUR PROPERTIES. WE HAVE BEEN REDUCING THE PERCENTAGE OF TRADITIONAL MALL TENANTS AND INCREASING THE SHARE OF SPACE DEDICATED TO DINING, ENTERTAINMENT, FAST FASHION, OFF PRICE, AND LARGE FORMAT BOX TENANTS. SOME OF THESE CHANGES MAY RESULT IN THE REDEVELOPMENT OF ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR PROPERTIES. SEE \u201c\u2014CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, REDEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.\u201d  TO FUND THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO REPLACE ANCHORS AND TO MAINTAIN A REASONABLE LEVEL OF LEVERAGE, WE EXPECT TO USE A VARIETY OF MEANS AVAILABLE TO US, SUBJECT TO AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF OUR CREDIT AGREEMENTS. THESE STEPS MIGHT INCLUDE (I) SELLING OUTPARCELS, (II) SELLING LAND PARCELS ON OUR PROPERTIES TO MULTIFAMILY OR HOTEL DEVELOPERS, (III) ENTERING INTO SALE-LEASEBACK OR OTHER STRUCTURED FINANCE TRANSACTIONS TO RAISE CAPITAL, (IV) MAKING ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS UNDER OUR 2018 REVOLVING FACILITY, (V) OBTAINING CONSTRUCTION LOANS ON SPECIFIC PROJECTS, (VI) SELLING PROPERTIES OR INTERESTS IN PROPERTIES WITH VALUES IN EXCESS OF THEIR MORTGAGE LOANS (IF APPLICABLE) AND APPLYING THE EXCESS PROCEEDS TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR FOR DEBT REDUCTION, (VII) OBTAINING CAPITAL FROM JOINT VENTURES OR OTHER PARTNERSHIPS OR ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVING OUR CONTRIBUTION OF ASSETS WITH INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS, PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTORS OR OTHER REITS, OR (VIII) OBTAINING EQUITY CAPITAL, INCLUDING THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON OR PREFERRED EQUITY SECURITIES IF MARKET CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE, OR THROUGH OTHER ACTIONS. IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE IN ACTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY DEVELOPERS TO SELL CERTAIN LAND PARCELS AND CURRENTLY EXPECT TO ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS OF SALE BEFORE THE END OF 2019.  CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, REDEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS  WE MIGHT ENGAGE IN VARIOUS TYPES OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS AT OUR OPERATING PROPERTIES. SUCH PROJECTS VARY IN COST AND COMPLEXITY, AND CAN INCLUDE BUILDING OUT NEW OR EXISTING SPACE FOR INDIVIDUAL TENANTS, UPGRADING COMMON AREAS OR EXTERIOR AREAS SUCH AS PARKING LOTS, OR REDEVELOPING THE ENTIRE PROPERTY, AMONG OTHER PROJECTS. PROJECT COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED IN \u201cCONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS\u201d ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET UNTIL THE ASSET IS PLACED INTO SERVICE, AND AMOUNTED TO $151.8 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN 2014, WE ENTERED INTO A 50/50 JOINT VENTURE WITH THE MACERICH COMPANY (\u201cMACERICH\u201d) TO REDEVELOP FASHION DISTRICT PHILADELPHIA. AS WE REDEVELOP FASHION DISTRICT PHILADELPHIA, OPERATING RESULTS IN THE SHORT TERM, AS MEASURED BY SALES, OCCUPANCY, REAL ESTATE REVENUE, PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, NET OPERATING INCOME (\u201cNOI\u201d) AND DEPRECIATION, WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED UNTIL THE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED SPACE IS COMPLETED, LEASED AND OCCUPIED. FASHION DISTRICT PHILADELPHIA OPEN  ED  IN SEPTEMBER 2019  AND  IS  NOT YET FULLY  STABILIZED AS  DEVELOPMENT WORK IS CONTINUING.  IN JANUARY 2018, OUR FASHION DISTRICT PHILADELPHIA REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT JOINT VENTURE ENTITY ENTERED INTO A $250.0 MILLION TERM LOAN (THE \u201cFDP TERM LOAN\u201d). THE INITIAL TERM OF THE FDP TERM LOAN IS FIVE YEARS, AND BEARS INTEREST AT A VARIABLE RATE OF 2.00% OVER LIBOR. PREIT AND MACERICH HAVE SECURED THE FDP TERM LOAN BY PLEDGING THEIR RESPECTIVE EQUITY INTERESTS IN THE ENTITIES THAT OWN THE FASHION DISTRICT PHILADELPHIA. THE ENTIRE $250.0 MILLION AVAILABLE UNDER THE FDP TERM LOAN WAS DRAWN DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, AND WE RECEIVED AN AGGREGATE OF $123.0 MILLION AS A DISTRIBUTION OF OUR SHARE OF THE DRAWS.  IN JULY 2019, THE FDP TERM LOAN WAS MODIFIED TO INCREASE THE TOTAL POTENTIAL BORROWINGS FROM $250.0 MILLION TO $350.0 MILLION. A TOTAL OF $51.0 MILLION WAS DRAWN DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND WE RECEIVED AGGREGATE DISTRIBUTIONS OF $25.0 MILLION AS OUR SHARE OF THE DRAWS.  AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2019, LENDER COMMITMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN RECEIVED FOR THE REMAINING $49.0 MILLION AVAILABLE UNDER THE FDP TERM LOAN.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE THAT REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE, OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND THAT MIGHT CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. IN PREPARING THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, MANAGEMENT HAS MADE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS. IN PREPARING THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, MANAGEMENT HAS UTILIZED AVAILABLE INFORMATION, INCLUDING OUR PAST HISTORY, INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, IN FORMING ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, GIVING DUE CONSIDERATION TO MATERIALITY. MANAGEMENT HAS ALSO CONSIDERED EVENTS AND CHANGES IN PROPERTY, MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM PROPERTY OPERATIONS AND THE RISK OF LOSS ON SPECIFIC ACCOUNTS OR AMOUNTS IN DETERMINING ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. IN ADDITION, OTHER COMPANIES MAY UTILIZE DIFFERENT ESTIMATES, WHICH MAY AFFECT COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO THOSE OF COMPANIES IN A SIMILAR BUSINESS. THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY MANAGEMENT IN APPLYING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE NOT CHANGED MATERIALLY DURING 2019 OR 2018, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE NOTED, AND NONE OF THESE ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS HAVE PROVEN TO BE MATERIALLY INCORRECT OR RESULTED IN OUR RECORDING ANY SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO PRIOR PERIODS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE KEY FACTORS UNDERLYING OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, BUT NO CHANGE IS CURRENTLY EXPECTED.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  ASSET IMPAIRMENT  REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS AND RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE PROPERTY MIGHT NOT BE RECOVERABLE. A PROPERTY TO BE HELD AND USED IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED ONLY IF MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATE OF THE AGGREGATE FUTURE CASH FLOWS, LESS ESTIMATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, TO BE GENERATED BY THE PROPERTY, UNDISCOUNTED AND WITHOUT INTEREST CHARGES, ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. THIS ESTIMATE TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION FACTORS SUCH AS EXPECTED FUTURE OPERATING INCOME, TRENDS AND PROSPECTS, AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF DEMAND, COMPETITION AND OTHER FACTORS.  THE DETERMINATION OF UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES BY MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE EXPECTED COURSE OF ACTION AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE THAT WOULD LEAD TO SUCH CASH FLOWS. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN THE ANTICIPATED ACTION TO BE TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPERTY COULD IMPACT THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT  EXISTS AND WHETHER THE EFFECTS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR NET INCOME. TO THE EXTENT ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PROPERTY, THE LOSS WILL BE MEASURED AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE PROPERTY OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTY.  ASSESSMENT OF OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER CERTAIN LEASE RELATED COSTS MUST BE MADE WHEN WE HAVE A REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE TENANT MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LEASE AS ORIGINALLY EXPECTED. THIS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AS TO THE RECOVERABILITY OF SUCH COSTS.  AN OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT OF AN INVESTMENT IN AN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS NOT CONSIDERED RECOVERABLE BASED ON EVALUATION OF THE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF THE DECLINE IN VALUE. TO THE EXTENT IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED, THE EXCESS CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET OVER ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IS CHARGED TO INCOME.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IF THERE IS A TRIGGERING EVENT IN RELATION TO A PROPERTY TO BE HELD AND USED, WE WILL ESTIMATE THE AGGREGATE FUTURE CASH FLOWS, LESS ESTIMATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, TO BE GENERATED BY THE PROPERTY, UNDISCOUNTED AND WITHOUT INTEREST CHARGES. IN ADDITION, THIS ESTIMATE MAY CONSIDER A PROBABILITY WEIGHTED CASH FLOW ESTIMATION APPROACH WHEN ALTERNATIVE COURSES OF ACTION TO RECOVER THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION OR WHEN A RANGE OF POSSIBLE VALUES IS ESTIMATED.  NEW ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS  SEE NOTE 1 TO OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO MATERIAL OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS OTHER THAN THE UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 3 TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND IN THE \u201cOVERVIEW\u201d SECTION ABOVE.

WE ALSO USE NET OPERATING INCOME (\u201cNOI\u201d) AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cFFO\u201d), WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, TO SUPPLEMENT OUR ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  \u2022  WE BELIEVE THAT NOI IS HELPFUL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS AS A MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE IT IS AN INDICATOR OF THE RETURN ON PROPERTY INVESTMENT AND PROVIDES A METHOD OF COMPARING PROPERTY PERFORMANCE OVER TIME. WHEN WE USE AND PRESENT NOI, WE ALSO DO SO ON A SAME STORE (\u201cSAME STORE NOI\u201d) AND NON SAME STORE (\u201cNON SAME STORE NOI\u201d) BASIS TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN PROPERTIES THAT WE HAVE OWNED FOR THE FULL PERIODS PRESENTED AND PROPERTIES ACQUIRED, SOLD, UNDER REDEVELOPMENT OR DESIGNATED AS NON-CORE DURING THOSE PERIODS. FURTHERMORE, OUR USE AND PRESENTATION OF NOI COMBINES NOI FROM OUR CONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES AND NOI ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR SHARE OF UNCONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT TOTAL NOI. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ALSO HELPFUL INFORMATION BECAUSE IT REFLECTS THE PRO RATA CONTRIBUTION FROM OUR UNCONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES THAT ARE OWNED THROUGH INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER GAAP AS EQUITY IN INCOME OF PARTNERSHIPS. SEE \u201cUNCONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES AND PROPORTIONATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION\u201d BELOW.  \u2022  WE BELIEVE THAT FFO IS ALSO HELPFUL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS AS A MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES VARIOUS ITEMS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME THAT DO NOT RELATE TO OR ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS GAINS ON SALES OF OPERATING REAL ESTATE AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF REAL ESTATE, AMONG OTHERS. IN ADDITION TO FFO AND FFO PER DILUTED SHARE AND OP UNIT, WHEN APPLICABLE, WE ALSO PRESENT FFO, AS ADJUSTED AND FFO PER DILUTED SHARE AND OP UNIT, AS ADJUSTED, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS HELPFUL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS BECAUSE THEY ADJUST FFO TO EXCLUDE ITEMS THAT MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS PROVISION FOR EMPLOYEE SEPARATION EXPENSE AND ACCELERATED AMORTIZATION OF FINANCING COSTS.  \u2022  WE USE BOTH NOI AND FFO, OR RELATED TERMS LIKE SAME STORE NOI AND, WHEN APPLICABLE, FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, AS ADJUSTED, FOR DETERMINING INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AMOUNTS UNDER CERTAIN OF OUR PERFORMANCE-BASED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS.  NOI AND FFO ARE COMMONLY USED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY, AND WE USE THEM AS SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP MEASURES TO COMPARE OUR PERFORMANCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT PERIODS AND TO COMPARE OUR PERFORMANCE TO THAT OF OUR INDUSTRY PEERS. OUR COMPUTATION OF NOI, FFO AND OTHER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, SUCH AS SAME STORE NOI, NON SAME STORE NOI, NOI ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR SHARE OF UNCONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES, AND FFO, AS ADJUSTED, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OUR INDUSTRY PEERS. NONE OF THESE MEASURES ARE MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AND THEY HAVE LIMITATIONS AS ANALYTICAL TOOLS. THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVE MEASURES OF OUR NET INCOME, OPERATING PERFORMANCE, CASH FLOW OR LIQUIDITY. THEY ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR OUR CASH NEEDS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS. PLEASE SEE BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE RECONCILIATION TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE.  UNCONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES AND PROPORTIONATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION  THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED BELOW INCORPORATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR SHARE OF UNCONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES. THIS PROPORTIONATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION, BUT WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS HELPFUL INFORMATION BECAUSE IT REFLECTS THE PRO RATA CONTRIBUTION FROM OUR UNCONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES THAT ARE OWNED THROUGH INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER GAAP USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. UNDER SUCH METHOD, EARNINGS FROM THESE UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS ARE RECORDED IN OUR STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP UNDER THE CAPTION ENTITLED \u201cEQUITY IN INCOME OF PARTNERSHIPS.\u201d  TO DERIVE THE PROPORTIONATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION REFLECTED IN THE TABLES BELOW AS \u201cUNCONSOLIDATED,\u201d WE MULTIPLIED THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR ECONOMIC INTEREST IN EACH PARTNERSHIP ON A PROPERTY-BY-PROPERTY BASIS BY EACH LINE ITEM. UNDER THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS RELATING TO OUR CURRENT UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS WITH THIRD PARTIES, WE OWN A 25% TO 50% ECONOMIC INTEREST IN SUCH PARTNERSHIPS, AND THERE ARE GENERALLY NO PROVISIONS IN SUCH PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS RELATING TO SPECIAL NON-PRO RATA ALLOCATIONS OF INCOME OR LOSS, AND THERE ARE NO PREFERRED OR PRIORITY RETURNS OF CAPITAL OR OTHER SIMILAR PROVISIONS. WHILE THIS METHOD APPROXIMATES OUR INDIRECT ECONOMIC INTEREST IN OUR PRO RATA SHARE OF THE REVENUE AND EXPENSES OF OUR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS, WE DO NOT HAVE A DIRECT LEGAL CLAIM TO THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES OR EXPENSES OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS BEYOND OUR RIGHTS AS AN EQUITY OWNER IN THE EVENT OF ANY LIQUIDATION OF SUCH ENTITY. OUR PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE LEGAL AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST. ACCORDINGLY, NOI AND FFO RESULTS BASED ON OUR SHARE OF THE RESULTS OF UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS DO NOT REPRESENT CASH GENERATED FROM OUR INVESTMENTS IN THESE PARTNERSHIPS.  WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT WE HOLD A NON CONTROLLING INTEREST IN EACH OF OUR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS, AND ACCOUNT FOR SUCH PARTNERSHIPS USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, BECAUSE.  \u2022  EXCEPT FOR TWO PROPERTIES THAT WE CO-MANAGE WITH OUR PARTNER, ALL OF THE OTHER ENTITIES ARE MANAGED ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS BY ONE OF OUR OTHER PARTNERS AS THE MANAGING GENERAL PARTNER IN EACH OF THE RESPECTIVE PARTNERSHIPS. IN THE CASE OF THE CO-MANAGED PROPERTIES, ALL DECISIONS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS ARE MADE JOINTLY.  \u2022  THE MANAGING GENERAL PARTNER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING THE OPERATING AND CAPITAL DECISIONS OF THE PARTNERSHIP, INCLUDING BUDGETS, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  ALL MAJOR DECISIONS OF EACH PARTNERSHIP, SUCH AS THE SALE, REFINANCING, EXPANSION OR REHABILITATION OF THE PROPERTY, REQUIRE THE APPROVAL OF ALL PARTNERS.  \u2022  VOTING RIGHTS AND THE SHARING OF PROFITS AND LOSSES ARE GENERALLY IN PROPORTION TO THE OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGES OF EACH PARTNER.  WE HOLD LEGAL TITLE TO A PROPERTY OWNED BY ONE OF OUR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS THROUGH A TENANCY IN COMMON ARRANGEMENT. FOR THIS PROPERTY, SUCH LEGAL TITLE IS HELD BY US AND ANOTHER ENTITY, AND EACH HAS AN UNDIVIDED INTEREST IN TITLE TO THE PROPERTY. WITH RESPECT TO THIS PROPERTY, UNDER THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN US AND THE ENTITY WITH OWNERSHIP INTERESTS, WE AND SUCH OTHER ENTITY HAVE JOINT CONTROL BECAUSE DECISIONS REGARDING MATTERS SUCH AS THE SALE, REFINANCING, EXPANSION OR REHABILITATION OF THE PROPERTY REQUIRE THE APPROVAL OF BOTH US AND THE OTHER ENTITY OWNING AN INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY. HENCE, WE ACCOUNT FOR THIS PROPERTY LIKE OUR OTHER UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THE BALANCE SHEET ITEMS ARISING FROM THIS PROPERTY APPEAR UNDER THE CAPTION \u201cINVESTMENTS IN PARTNERSHIPS, AT EQUITY.\u201d  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS, SEE NOTE 3 TO OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  NET OPERATING INCOME (\u201cNOI\u201d)  NOI (A NON-GAAP MEASURE) IS DERIVED FROM REAL ESTATE REVENUE (DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, INCLUDING LEASE TERMINATION REVENUE), MINUS PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES (DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP), PLUS OUR PRO RATA SHARE OF REVENUE AND PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES OF OUR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIP INVESTMENTS. NOI EXCLUDES OTHER INCOME, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INSURANCE RECOVERIES, EMPLOYEE SEPARATION EXPENSES, INTEREST EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS, GAINS/ ADJUSTMENT TO GAINS ON SALE OF INTEREST IN NON OPERATING REAL ESTATE, GAIN ON SALE OF INTEREST IN REAL ESTATE BY EQUITY METHOD INVESTEE, GAINS/ LOSSES ON SALES OF INTERESTS IN REAL ESTATE, NET, GAIN OR LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT, AND PROJECT COSTS AND OTHER EXPENSES. WE BELIEVE THAT NET INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO NOI.  SAME STORE NOI IS CALCULATED USING RETAIL PROPERTIES OWNED FOR THE FULL PERIODS PRESENTED AND EXCLUDES PROPERTIES ACQUIRED, DISPOSED, UNDER REDEVELOPMENT OR DESIGNATED AS NON-CORE DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. IN 2018, WYOMING VALLEY MALL WAS DESIGNATED AS NON-CORE AND SUBSEQUENTLY CONVEYED TO THE LENDER OF THE MORTGAGE LOAN SECURED BY THAT PROPERTY IN SEPTEMBER 2019. IN 2019, EXTON SQUARE AND VALLEY VIEW MALLS WERE DESIGNATED AS NON-CORE AND ARE EXCLUDED FROM SAME STORE NOI. NON SAME STORE NOI IS CALCULATED USING THE RETAIL PROPERTIES EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION OF SAME STORE NOI.

THE DECREASE IN SAME STORE NOI PRIMARILY IS DUE TO LOST REVENUES FROM BANKRUPT TENANTS AND ASSOCIATED WRITE-OFFS OF PRE-PETITION TENANT RECEIVABLES. THE DECREASE IN NOI FROM NON SAME STORE PROPERTIES IS DUE TO LOWER NOI CONTRIBUTIONS FROM VALLEY VIEW AND WYOMING VALLEY MALLS, RESULTING FROM ANCHOR CLOSINGS AND RELATED CO-TENANCY REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS FOR TENANTS STILL IN OCCUPANCY, LOST REVENUES FROM BANKRUPT TENANTS AND THE SALE OF THE WHOLE FOODS PARCEL AT EXTON SQUARE MALL IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cFFO\u201d)  THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\u201cNAREIT\u201d) DEFINES FFO, WHICH IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE COMMONLY USED BY REITS, AS NET INCOME (COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP) EXCLUDING (I) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION RELATED TO REAL ESTATE, (II) GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE SALE OF CERTAIN REAL ESTATE ASSETS, (III) GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGE IN CONTROL, AND (IV) IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS OF CERTAIN REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES WHEN THE IMPAIRMENT IS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF DEPRECIABLE REAL ESTATE HELD BY THE ENTITY. WE COMPUTE FFO IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY NAREIT, WHICH MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO FFO REPORTED BY OTHER REITS THAT DO NOT DEFINE THE TERM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CURRENT NAREIT DEFINITION, OR THAT INTERPRET THE CURRENT NAREIT DEFINITION DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FFO IS A COMMONLY USED MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PROFITABILITY AMONG REITS. WE USE FFO AND FFO PER DILUTED SHARE AND UNIT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP (\u201cOP UNIT\u201d) AND, WHEN APPLICABLE, RELATED MEASURES SUCH AS FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, AS ADJUSTED, IN MEASURING OUR PERFORMANCE AGAINST OUR PEERS AND AS ONE OF THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR DETERMINING INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AMOUNTS EARNED UNDER CERTAIN OF OUR PERFORMANCE-BASED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS.  FFO DOES NOT INCLUDE GAINS AND LOSSES ON SALES OF OPERATING REAL ESTATE ASSETS OR IMPAIRMENT WRITE DOWNS OF DEPRECIABLE REAL ESTATE, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE DETERMINATION OF NET INCOME IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. ACCORDINGLY, FFO IS NOT A COMPREHENSIVE MEASURE OF OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS. IN ADDITION, SINCE FFO DOES NOT INCLUDE DEPRECIATION ON REAL ESTATE ASSETS, FFO MAY NOT BE A USEFUL PERFORMANCE MEASURE WHEN COMPARING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE TO THAT OF OTHER NON-REAL ESTATE COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISES. WE COMPENSATE FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY USING FFO IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER GAAP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES, SUCH AS NET INCOME AND NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AND OTHER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES, SUCH AS NOI. FFO DOES NOT REPRESENT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET INCOME (DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP) AS AN INDICATION OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES (DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP) AS A MEASURE OF OUR LIQUIDITY, NOR IS IT INDICATIVE OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR OUR CASH NEEDS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT NET INCOME IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASUREMENT TO FFO.  WE ALSO PRESENT FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, AS ADJUSTED, AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS PER DILUTED SHARE AND OP UNIT, AS ADJUSTED, WHICH ARE NON-GAAP MEASURES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, TO SHOW THE EFFECT OF SUCH ITEMS AS GAIN OR LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT (INCLUDING ACCELERATED AMORTIZATION OF FINANCING COSTS), IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS, PROVISION FOR EMPLOYEE SEPARATION EXPENSE AND INSURANCE RECOVERIES OR LOSSES, NET, WHICH AFFECTED OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BUT ARE NOT, IN OUR OPINION, INDICATIVE OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THIS \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d SECTION CONTAINS CERTAIN \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d THAT RELATE TO EXPECTATIONS AND PROJECTIONS THAT ARE NOT HISTORICAL FACTS. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REFLECT OUR CURRENT VIEWS ABOUT OUR FUTURE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MIGHT CAUSE OUR ACTUAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MIGHT AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES INCLUDE THOSE DISCUSSED HEREIN AND IN THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\u201d IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. WE DO NOT INTEND TO UPDATE OR REVISE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ABOUT OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES TO REFLECT NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS, RECURRING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND LEASING COMMISSIONS, BUT EXCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND REDEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, GENERALLY THROUGH OUR AVAILABLE WORKING CAPITAL, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS, BORROWINGS UNDER OUR 2018 REVOLVING FACILITY, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OUR 2018 REVOLVING FACILITY, AND ASSET SALES, INCLUDING THE SALE OF LAND PARCELS TO THIRD PARTIES FOR MULTIFAMILY AND HOTEL DEVELOPMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW US TO MAKE ANY DISTRIBUTIONS NECESSARY TO ENABLE US TO CONTINUE TO QUALIFY AS A REIT UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED. THE AGGREGATE DISTRIBUTIONS MADE TO PREFERRED SHAREHOLDERS, COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND OP UNIT HOLDERS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE $70.6 MILLION, BASED ON DISTRIBUTIONS OF $1.3827 PER SERIES B PREFERRED SHARE, $1.3500 PER SERIES C PREFERRED SHARE, $1.2891 PER SERIES D SHARE, AND $0.63 PER COMMON SHARE AND OP UNIT.  IN DECEMBER 2017, OUR UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WAS FILED WITH THE SEC AND BECAME EFFECTIVE. WE MAY USE THE AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT TO OFFER AND SELL COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST, PREFERRED SHARES AND VARIOUS TYPES OF DEBT SECURITIES, AMONG OTHER TYPES OF SECURITIES, TO THE PUBLIC.  THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR CASH FLOWS AND REQUIRE THE FUNDING OF FUTURE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS, RECURRING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, TENANT IMPROVEMENTS OR LEASING COMMISSIONS WITH SOURCES OTHER THAN OPERATING CASH FLOWS.  \u2022  ADVERSE CHANGES OR PROLONGED DOWNTURNS IN GENERAL, LOCAL OR RETAIL INDUSTRY ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL, CREDIT OR CAPITAL MARKET OR COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS, LEADING TO A REDUCTION IN REAL ESTATE REVENUE OR CASH FLOWS OR AN INCREASE IN EXPENSES;  \u2022  DETERIORATION IN OUR TENANTS\u2019 BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL STABILITY, INCLUDING ANCHOR OR NON-ANCHOR TENANT BANKRUPTCIES, LEASING DELAYS OR TERMINATIONS, OR LOWER SALES, CAUSING DEFERRALS OR DECLINES IN RENT, PERCENTAGE RENT AND CASH FLOWS;  \u2022  INABILITY TO ACHIEVE TARGETS FOR, OR DECREASES IN, PROPERTY OCCUPANCY AND RENTAL RATES, RESULTING IN LOWER OR DELAYED REAL ESTATE REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME;  \u2022  INCREASES IN OPERATING COSTS, INCLUDING INCREASES THAT CANNOT BE PASSED ON TO TENANTS, RESULTING IN REDUCED OPERATING INCOME AND CASH FLOWS; AND  \u2022  INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES, INCLUDING POTENTIALLY AS A RESULT OF THE EXPECTED PHASE OUT OF LIBOR, RESULTING IN HIGHER BORROWING COSTS.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE EXPECT TO MEET CERTAIN OF OUR LONGER-TERM REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS OBLIGATIONS TO FUND REDEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, CERTAIN CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING SCHEDULED DEBT MATURITIES), FUTURE PROPERTY AND PORTFOLIO ACQUISITIONS, RENOVATIONS, EXPANSIONS AND OTHER NON-RECURRING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, THROUGH A VARIETY OF CAPITAL SOURCES, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OUR CREDIT AGREEMENTS, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW.  THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS FLUCTUATE AND, AT TIMES, LIMIT ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY FINANCING FOR COMPANIES.  WHILE WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS CAPITAL, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE OR ON SIMILAR TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  LIBOR ALTERNATIVE  IN JULY 2017, THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY (\u201cFCA\u201d), WHICH IS THE AUTHORITY THAT REGULATES LIBOR, ANNOUNCED IT INTENDS TO STOP COMPELLING BANKS TO SUBMIT RATES FOR THE CALCULATION OF LIBOR AFTER 2021. THE ALTERNATIVE REFERENCE RATES COMMITTEE (\"ARRC\") HAS IDENTIFIED THE SECURED OVERNIGHT FINANCING RATE (\"SOFR\") AS THE RATE THAT REPRESENTS BEST PRACTICE AS THE ALTERNATIVE TO USD-LIBOR FOR USE IN DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL CONTRACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY INDEXED TO USD-LIBOR. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PREDICT WHEN LIBOR WILL CEASE TO BE AVAILABLE OR WHEN THERE WILL BE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY IN THE SOFR MARKETS. ANY CHANGES ADOPTED BY FCA OR OTHER GOVERNING BODIES IN THE METHOD USED FOR DETERMINING LIBOR MAY RESULT IN A SUDDEN OR PROLONGED INCREASE OR DECREASE IN REPORTED LIBOR. IF THAT WERE TO OCCUR, OUR INTEREST PAYMENTS COULD CHANGE, PERHAPS SUBSTANTIALLY. IN ADDITION, UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE EXTENT AND MANNER OF FUTURE CHANGES MAY RESULT IN INTEREST RATES AND/OR PAYMENTS THAT ARE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN IF LIBOR WERE TO REMAIN AVAILABLE IN ITS CURRENT FORM.  WE HAVE MATERIAL CONTRACTS THAT ARE INDEXED TO LIBOR AND ARE MONITORING AND EVALUATING THE RELATED RISKS, WHICH INCLUDE INTEREST ON LOANS OR AMOUNTS RECEIVED AND PAID ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THESE RISKS ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH TRANSITIONING CONTRACTS TO A NEW ALTERNATIVE RATE, INCLUDING ANY RESULTING VALUE TRANSFER THAT MAY OCCUR. THE VALUE OF LOANS, SECURITIES, AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TIED TO LIBOR COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED IF LIBOR IS LIMITED OR DISCONTINUED. FOR SOME INSTRUMENTS, THE METHOD OF TRANSITIONING TO AN ALTERNATIVE RATE MAY BE CHALLENGING, AS THEY MAY REQUIRE NEGOTIATION WITH THE RESPECTIVE COUNTERPARTY.  IF A CONTRACT IS NOT TRANSITIONED TO AN ALTERNATIVE RATE AND LIBOR IS DISCONTINUED, THE IMPACT ON OUR CONTRACTS IS LIKELY TO VARY BY CONTRACT. IF LIBOR IS DISCONTINUED OR IF THE METHODS OF CALCULATING LIBOR CHANGE FROM THEIR CURRENT FORM, INTEREST RATES ON OUR CURRENT OR FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  WHILE WE EXPECT LIBOR TO BE AVAILABLE IN SUBSTANTIALLY ITS CURRENT FORM UNTIL THE END OF 2021, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT LIBOR WILL BECOME UNAVAILABLE PRIOR TO THAT POINT. THIS COULD OCCUR, FOR EXAMPLE, IF A REQUISITE NUMBER OF BANKS DECLINE TO MAKE SUBMISSIONS TO THE LIBOR ADMINISTRATOR. IN THAT CASE, THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSITION TO AN ALTERNATIVE REFERENCE RATE WOULD BE ACCELERATED AND MAGNIFIED.  CREDIT AGREEMENTS  WE HAVE ENTERED INTO TWO CREDIT AGREEMENTS (COLLECTIVELY, AS AMENDED, THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENTS\u201d): (1) THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH INCLUDES (A) THE $400 MILLION 2018 REVOLVING FACILITY AND (B) THE $300 MILLION 2018 TERM LOAN FACILITY, AND (2) THE $250 MILLION 2014 7-YEAR TERM LOAN. THE 2018 TERM LOAN FACILITY AND THE 2014 7-YEAR TERM LOAN ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE \u201cTERM LOANS.\u201d  WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL FINANCIAL COVENANTS IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS. SEE NOTE 4 IN THE NOTES TO OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE IDENTICAL COVENANTS AND COMMON PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD BORROWED $550.0 MILLION UNDER THE TERM LOANS AND $213.0 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR 2018 REVOLVING FACILITY. PURSUANT TO CERTAIN COVENANTS IN THE 2018 REVOLVING FACILITY, THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE 2018 REVOLVING FACILITY THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO US AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $80.7 MILLION.  INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE AGREEMENTS  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS OUTSTANDING WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE BASE INTEREST RATE OF 1.85% ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $796.1 MILLION, MATURING ON VARIOUS DATES THROUGH MAY 2023 AND A FORWARD STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 2.75% ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $100.0 MILLION, WITH AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF JUNE 2020 AND A MATURITY DATE OF MAY 2023.  MORTGAGE LOAN ACTIVITY  WE RECEIVED A NOTICE OF TRANSFER OF SERVICING, DATED JULY 9, 2018, FROM THE SPECIAL SERVICER FOR THE MORTGAGE LOAN SECURED BY WYOMING VALLEY MALL, WHICH HAD A BALANCE OF $72.8 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 26, 2019. OUR SUBSIDIARY THAT WAS THE BORROWER UNDER THE LOAN ALSO RECEIVED A NOTICE OF DEFAULT ON THE LOAN FROM THE LENDER, DATED DECEMBER 14, 2018. THE LOAN WAS SUBJECT TO A CASH SWEEP ARRANGEMENT AS A RESULT OF AN ANCHOR TENANT TRIGGER EVENT. WE HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE LENDER TO JOINTLY MARKET THE PROPERTY FOR SALE FOR A STIPULATED PERIOD OF TIME. THE PROPERTY DID NOT SELL AND WE CONVEYED THE PROPERTY TO THE LENDER BY DEED IN LIEU OF FORECLOSURE ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2019.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN APRIL 2019, WE RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM THE SERVICER OF THE CUMBERLAND MALL MORTGAGE OF A CASH SWEEP EVENT DUE TO THE FAILURE OF AN ANCHOR TENANT TO RENEW FOR A FULL TERM.  WE SATISFIED THIS REQUIREMENT I  N  AUGUST  2019.  MORTGAGE LOANS  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR MORTGAGE LOANS, WHICH ARE SECURED BY NINE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES, ARE DUE IN INSTALLMENTS OVER VARIOUS TERMS EXTENDING TO OCTOBER 2025. SIX OF THESE MORTGAGE LOANS BEAR INTEREST AT FIXED INTEREST RATES THAT RANGE FROM 3.88% TO 5.95% AND HAD A WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 4.08% AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THREE OF OUR MORTGAGE LOANS BEAR INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES, A PORTION OF WHICH HAVE BEEN SWAPPED TO FIXED RATES, AND, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS, HAD A WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 3.75% AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF ALL CONSOLIDATED MORTGAGE LOANS WAS 3.99% AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. MORTGAGE LOANS FOR PROPERTIES OWNED BY UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN \u201cINVESTMENTS IN PARTNERSHIPS, AT EQUITY\u201d AND \u201cDISTRIBUTIONS IN EXCESS OF PARTNERSHIP INVESTMENTS\u201d ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE BELOW.

(2)  FOR INTEREST PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIABLE RATE DEBT, THESE AMOUNTS ARE BASED ON THE RATES IN EFFECT ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  (3)  THE TIMING OF THE PAYMENTS OF THESE AMOUNTS IS UNCERTAIN. WE EXPECT THAT THESE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AND IN 2020, BUT CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE THAT CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES AT THESE PROJECTS WILL NOT DELAY THE SETTLEMENT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE INCLUDED 100% OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE FASHION DISTRICT PHILADELPHIA REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT BECAUSE OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, PREIT ASSOCIATES, AND MACERICH, HAVE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY GUARANTEED THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE JOINT VENTURE WE FORMED WITH MACERICH TO DEVELOP FASHION DISTRICT PHILADELPHIA TO COMMENCE AND COMPLETE A COMPREHENSIVE REDEVELOPMENT OF THAT PROPERTY COSTING NOT LESS THAN $300.0 MILLION WITHIN 48 MONTHS AFTER COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION, WHICH WAS MARCH 14, 2016.

THIS DECREASE WAS DUE TO LOWER NOI FROM SAME STORE AND NON SAME STORE PROPERTIES AND HIGHER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CHANGE FROM THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD WHICH REQUIRES THE EXPENSING OF CERTAIN LEASING COSTS THAT WERE PERMITTED TO BE CAPITALIZED UNDER THE PREVIOUS STANDARD, AND CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL BETWEEN PERIODS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.  CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WERE $87.9 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $0.1 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 INCLUDED $44.2 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM ASSET SALES INCLUDING THE SALE OF TWO LAND PARCELS AND TWO OUTPARCELS, THE SALE OF A MORTGAGE LOAN AND CASH DISTRIBUTIONS OF PROCEEDS FROM REAL ESTATE SOLD BY AN EQUITY METHOD INVESTEE, AS WELL AS $7.0 MILLION OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS, AND $25.0 MILLION OF DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE DRAWS UNDER OUR EXPANDED FASHION DISTRICT PHILADELPHIA TERM LOAN. CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED ADDITIONS TO CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS OF $86.2 MILLION, INVESTMENTS IN PARTNERSHIPS OF $55.2 MILLION (PRIMARILY AT FASHION DISTRICT PHILADELPHIA), AND REAL ESTATE IMPROVEMENTS OF $21.2 MILLION (PRIMARILY RELATED TO ONGOING IMPROVEMENTS AT OUR PROPERTIES).  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 INCLUDED $123.0 MILLION OF DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR FASHION DISTRICT PHILADELPHIA TERM LOAN AND $19.7 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM OUR SHARE OF THE SALE OF THE CONDOMINIUM SPACE AT 907 MARKET STREET, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ADDITIONS TO CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS OF $51.3 MILLION, INVESTMENTS IN PARTNERSHIPS OF $47.1 MILLION (PRIMARILY AT FASHION DISTRICT PHILADELPHIA), AND REAL ESTATE IMPROVEMENTS OF $23.9 MILLION (PRIMARILY RELATED TO ONGOING IMPROVEMENTS AT OUR PROPERTIES).  CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WERE $6.4 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $96.3 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 INCLUDED AGGREGATE DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS OF $70.6 MILLION, PRINCIPAL INSTALLMENTS ON MORTGAGE LOANS OF $12.8 MILLION, AND $71.2 MILLION USED TO DEFEASE THE MORTGAGE LOANS SECURED BY CAPITAL CITY MALL AND THE RELEASE OF ESCROW FUNDS RELATING TO THE CONVEYANCE OF THE MORTGAGE LOAN SECURED BY WYOMING VALLEY MALL TO THE LENDER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $148.0 MILLION OF NET BORROWINGS UNDER OUR 2018 REVOLVING FACILITY.  CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018 INCLUDED $16.0 MILLION OF NET REPAYMENTS ON OUR 2013 REVOLVING FACILITY, AGGREGATE DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS OF $70.1 MILLION, AND PRINCIPAL INSTALLMENTS ON MORTGAGE LOANS OF $14.2 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $10.2 MILLION OF BORROWING SECURED BY VIEWMONT MALL.  ENVIRONMENTAL  WE ARE AWARE OF CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AT SOME OF OUR PROPERTIES. WE HAVE, IN THE PAST, PERFORMED REMEDIATION OF SUCH ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, AND WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT REMAINING POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATING TO THESE ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS OR OF ANY OBLIGATION TO SATISFY REQUIREMENTS FOR FURTHER REMEDIATION. WE MAY BE REQUIRED IN THE FUTURE TO PERFORM TESTING RELATING TO THESE MATTERS. WE HAVE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS UP TO $25.0 MILLION PER OCCURRENCE AND UP TO $25.0 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE. SEE OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, IN THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\u2014WE MIGHT INCUR COSTS TO COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\u201d  COMPETITION AND TENANT CREDIT RISK  COMPETITION IN THE RETAIL REAL ESTATE MARKET IS INTENSE. WE COMPETE WITH OTHER PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RETAIL REAL ESTATE COMPANIES, INCLUDING COMPANIES THAT OWN OR MANAGE MALLS, POWER CENTERS, STRIP CENTERS, LIFESTYLE CENTERS, FACTORY OUTLET CENTERS, THEME/FESTIVAL CENTERS AND COMMUNITY CENTERS, AS WELL AS OTHER COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS AND REAL ESTATE OWNERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH PROPERTIES NEAR OUR PROPERTIES, ON THE BASIS OF SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING LOCATION AND RENT CHARGED. WE COMPETE WITH THESE COMPANIES TO ATTRACT CUSTOMERS TO OUR PROPERTIES, AS WELL AS TO ATTRACT ANCHOR AND NON-ANCHOR STORES AND OTHER TENANTS. WE ALSO COMPETE TO ACQUIRE LAND FOR NEW SITE DEVELOPMENT OR TO ACQUIRE PARCELS OR PROPERTIES TO ADD TO OUR EXISTING PROPERTIES. OUR MALLS AND OUR OTHER OPERATING PROPERTIES FACE COMPETITION FROM SIMILAR RETAIL CENTERS, INCLUDING MORE RECENTLY DEVELOPED OR RENOVATED CENTERS THAT ARE NEAR OUR RETAIL PROPERTIES. WE ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT RETAIL FORMATS, INCLUDING INTERNET RETAILERS, DISCOUNT OR VALUE RETAILERS, HOME SHOPPING NETWORKS, MAIL ORDER OPERATORS, CATALOGS, AND TELEMARKETERS. OUR TENANTS FACE COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES AT THE SAME AND OTHER PROPERTIES AND FROM OTHER RETAIL FORMATS AS WELL, INCLUDING INTERNET RETAILERS. THIS COMPETITION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO LEASE SPACE AND ON THE AMOUNT OF RENT AND EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS THAT WE RECEIVE.  THE EXISTENCE OR DEVELOPMENT OF COMPETING RETAIL PROPERTIES AND THE RELATED INCREASED COMPETITION FOR TENANTS MIGHT, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS, REQUIRE US TO MAKE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS TO PROPERTIES THAT WE WOULD HAVE DEFERRED OR WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE PLANNED TO MAKE AND MIGHT ALSO AFFECT THE TOTAL SALES, SALES PER SQUARE FOOT, OCCUPANCY AND NET OPERATING INCOME OF SUCH PROPERTIES. ANY SUCH CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, UNDERTAKEN INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY, WOULD INVOLVE COSTS AND EXPENSES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE COMPETE WITH MANY OTHER ENTITIES ENGAGED IN REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES FOR ACQUISITIONS OF MALLS, OTHER RETAIL PROPERTIES AND PRIME DEVELOPMENT SITES OR SITES ADJACENT TO OUR PROPERTIES, INCLUDING INSTITUTIONAL PENSION FUNDS, OTHER REITS AND OTHER OWNER-OPERATORS OF RETAIL PROPERTIES. WHEN WE SEEK TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS, COMPETITORS MIGHT DRIVE UP THE PRICE WE MUST PAY FOR PROPERTIES, PARCELS, OTHER ASSETS OR OTHER COMPANIES OR MIGHT THEMSELVES SUCCEED IN ACQUIRING THOSE PROPERTIES, PARCELS, ASSETS OR COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, OUR POTENTIAL ACQUISITION TARGETS MIGHT FIND OUR COMPETITORS TO BE MORE ATTRACTIVE SUITORS IF THEY HAVE GREATER RESOURCES, ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE, OR HAVE A MORE COMPATIBLE OPERATING PHILOSOPHY. IN PARTICULAR, LARGER REITS MIGHT ENJOY SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT RESULT FROM, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A LOWER COST OF CAPITAL, A BETTER ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL, A BETTER ABILITY TO FINANCE AN ACQUISITION, BETTER CASH FLOW AND ENHANCED OPERATING EFFICIENCIES. WE MIGHT NOT SUCCEED IN ACQUIRING RETAIL PROPERTIES OR DEVELOPMENT SITES THAT WE SEEK, OR, IF WE PAY A HIGHER PRICE FOR A PROPERTY AND/OR GENERATE LOWER CASH FLOW FROM AN ACQUIRED PROPERTY THAN WE EXPECT, OUR INVESTMENT RETURNS WILL BE REDUCED, WHICH WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES.  WE RECEIVE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR OPERATING INCOME AS RENT UNDER LEASES WITH TENANTS. AT ANY TIME, ANY TENANT HAVING SPACE IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR PROPERTIES COULD EXPERIENCE A DOWNTURN IN ITS BUSINESS THAT MIGHT WEAKEN ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION. SUCH TENANTS MIGHT ENTER INTO OR RENEW LEASES WITH RELATIVELY SHORTER TERMS. SUCH TENANTS MIGHT ALSO DEFER OR FAIL TO MAKE RENTAL PAYMENTS WHEN DUE, DELAY OR DEFER LEASE COMMENCEMENT, VOLUNTARILY VACATE THE PREMISES OR DECLARE BANKRUPTCY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE TERMINATION OF THE TENANT\u2019S LEASE OR PRECLUDE THE COLLECTION OF RENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE SPACE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, AND COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL LOSSES TO US AND HARM TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ALSO, IT MIGHT TAKE TIME TO TERMINATE LEASES OF UNDERPERFORMING OR NONPERFORMING TENANTS AND WE MIGHT INCUR COSTS TO REMOVE SUCH TENANTS. SOME OF OUR TENANTS OCCUPY STORES AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS IN OUR PORTFOLIO, AND SO THE EFFECT OF ANY BANKRUPTCY OR STORE CLOSINGS OF THOSE TENANTS MIGHT BE MORE SIGNIFICANT TO US THAN THE BANKRUPTCY OR STORE CLOSINGS OF OTHER TENANTS. SEE \u201cITEM 2. PROPERTIES\u2014MAJOR TENANTS\u201d IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. IN ADDITION, UNDER MANY OF OUR LEASES, OUR TENANTS PAY RENT BASED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, ON A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR SALES. ACCORDINGLY, DECLINES IN THESE TENANTS\u2019 SALES DIRECTLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ALSO, IF TENANTS ARE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF THEIR LEASES, OR OTHERWISE SEEK CHANGES TO THE TERMS, INCLUDING CHANGES TO THE AMOUNT OF RENT, WE MIGHT MODIFY LEASE TERMS IN WAYS THAT ARE LESS FAVORABLE TO US. GIVEN CURRENT CONDITIONS IN THE ECONOMY, CERTAIN INDUSTRIES AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS, IN SOME INSTANCES RETAILERS THAT HAVE SOUGHT PROTECTION FROM CREDITORS UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAW HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION FINANCING, WHICH HAS DECREASED THE LIKELIHOOD THAT SUCH RETAILERS WILL EMERGE FROM BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION AND HAS LIMITED THEIR ALTERNATIVES.  SEASONALITY  THERE IS SEASONALITY IN THE RETAIL REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY. RETAIL PROPERTY LEASES OFTEN PROVIDE FOR THE PAYMENT OF ALL OR A PORTION OF RENT BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF A TENANT\u2019S SALES REVENUE, OR SALES REVENUE OVER CERTAIN LEVELS. INCOME FROM SUCH RENT IS RECORDED ONLY AFTER THE MINIMUM SALES LEVELS HAVE BEEN MET. THE SALES LEVELS ARE OFTEN MET IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, DURING THE DECEMBER HOLIDAY SEASON. ALSO, MANY NEW AND TEMPORARY LEASES ARE ENTERED INTO LATER IN THE YEAR IN ANTICIPATION OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND A HIGHER NUMBER OF TENANTS VACATE THEIR SPACE EARLY IN THE YEAR. AS A RESULT, OUR OCCUPANCY AND CASH FLOWS ARE GENERALLY HIGHER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND LOWER IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS. OUR CONCENTRATION IN THE RETAIL SECTOR INCREASES OUR EXPOSURE TO SEASONALITY AND HAS RESULTED, AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO RESULT, IN A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF OUR CASH FLOWS BEING RECEIVED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.  INFLATION  INFLATION CAN HAVE MANY EFFECTS ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. RETAIL PROPERTY LEASES OFTEN PROVIDE FOR THE PAYMENT OF RENT BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, WHICH MIGHT INCREASE WITH INFLATION. LEASES MIGHT ALSO PROVIDE FOR TENANTS TO BEAR ALL OR A PORTION OF OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH MIGHT REDUCE THE IMPACT OF SUCH INCREASES ON US. HOWEVER, RENT INCREASES MIGHT NOT KEEP UP WITH INFLATION, OR IF WE RECOVER A SMALLER PROPORTION OF PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, WE MIGHT BEAR MORE COSTS IF SUCH EXPENSES INCREASE BECAUSE OF INFLATION.

WE ARE A LEADING FABRICATOR OF COMPLEX STEEL STRUCTURES, MODULES AND MARINE VESSELS USED IN ENERGY EXTRACTION AND PRODUCTION, PETROCHEMICAL AND INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES, POWER GENERATION, ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND SHIPPING AND MARINE TRANSPORTATION OPERATIONS. WE ALSO PROVIDE PROJECT MANAGEMENT, HOOKUP, COMMISSIONING, REPAIR, MAINTENANCE AND CIVIL CONSTRUCTION SERVICES. OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE UNITED STATES (\"U.S.\") AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, INTERNATIONAL ENERGY PRODUCERS; PETROCHEMICAL, INDUSTRIAL, POWER, AND MARINE OPERATORS; EPC COMPANIES; AND AGENCIES OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.  WE OPERATE AND MANAGE OUR BUSINESS THROUGH THREE OPERATING DIVISIONS (\"FABRICATION\", \"SHIPYARD\" AND \"SERVICES\") AND ONE NON-OPERATING DIVISION (\"CORPORATE\"), WHICH REPRESENT OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER 2019, OUR FORMER EPC DIVISION WAS OPERATIONALLY COMBINED WITH OUR FABRICATION DIVISION, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE SEGMENT RESULTS FOR THE EPC DIVISION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 WERE COMBINED WITH THE FABRICATION DIVISION TO CONFORM TO THE PRESENTATION OF OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS FOR THE 2019 PERIOD.  SEE NOTE 7 OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR REALIGNED OPERATING DIVISIONS.  OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IS LOCATED IN HOUSTON, TEXAS, WITH OPERATING FACILITIES LOCATED IN HOUMA, JENNINGS AND LAKE CHARLES, LOUISIANA.  BEGINNING IN LATE 2014, A SEVERE AND SUSTAINED DECLINE IN OIL AND GAS PRICES LED TO A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY DRILLING ACTIVITIES AND CAPITAL SPENDING FROM OUR TRADITIONAL OFFSHORE CUSTOMER BASE.  AS A RESULT, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AS WE EXPERIENCED REDUCTIONS IN REVENUE, LOWER MARGINS DUE TO COMPETITIVE PRICING AND A SIGNIFICANT UNDERUTILIZATION OF OUR FACILITIES IN OUR FABRICATION AND SHIPYARD DIVISIONS.  IN ADDITION, WE INCURRED LOSSES ON CERTAIN PROJECTS IN OUR SHIPYARD AND FABRICATION DIVISIONS.  AS A RESULT OF THESE MARKET CHANGES AND PROJECT LOSSES, WE IMPLEMENTED INITIATIVES TO PRESERVE AND IMPROVE OUR LIQUIDITY THROUGH COST REDUCTION EFFORTS AND THE SALE OF UNDERUTILIZED ASSETS.  FURTHER, TO REDUCE OUR FABRICATION DIVISION'S RELIANCE ON OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS CONSTRUCTION AND OUR SHIPYARD DIVISION'S RELIANCE ON MARINE VESSEL WORK RELATED TO THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR, WE BEGAN TO STRATEGICALLY REPOSITION THE COMPANY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FABRICATION OF PETROCHEMICAL AND INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES, PURSUE OFFSHORE WIND OPPORTUNITIES AND DIVERSIFY OUR CUSTOMER BASE WITHIN ALL OUR OPERATING DIVISIONS. WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN OUR EFFORTS TO REPOSITION THE COMPANY, INCREASE OUR BACKLOG AND IMPROVE AND PRESERVE OUR LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING COST REDUCTIONS (INCLUDING REDUCING THE COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS) AND THE SALE OF UNDERUTILIZED ASSETS. WE ARE FURTHER FOCUSED ON STRENGTHENING RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY CUSTOMERS AND ENHANCING OUR PROPOSAL, ESTIMATING AND OPERATIONS RESOURCES, PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES TO IMPROVE OUR COMPETITIVENESS AND OVERALL PROJECT EXECUTION.  ONGOING EFFORT TO DIVEST OF UNDERUTILIZED ASSETS  FABRICATION ASSETS HELD FOR SALE -  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , OUR FABRICATION DIVISION HAD  $17.9 MILLION  OF ASSETS HELD FOR SALE (\"FABRICATION AHFS\") WHICH WERE INITIALLY EXPECTED TO BE SOLD WITH THE SOUTH TEXAS PROPERTIES. THESE ASSETS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF THREE 660-TON CRAWLER CRANES, A DECK BARGE, TWO PLATE BENDING ROLL MACHINES AND PANEL LINE EQUIPMENT.  THE FABRICATION AHFS WERE RELOCATED TO OUR FABRICATION YARD IN HOUMA, LOUISIANA.  SEE NOTE 3 OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, INCLUDING RECENT SALES OF UNDERUTILIZED ASSETS.  SHIPYARD ASSETS HELD FOR SALE  - AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , OUR SHIPYARD DIVISION HAD  $0.6 MILLION  OF ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, WHICH CONSISTS OF A 2,500-TON DRYDOCK. WE SOLD THE DRYDOCK IN OCTOBER 2019 FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $0.6 MILLION.  ONGOING EFFORTS TO INCREASE OUR BACKLOG, DIVERSIFY OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND RESOLVE CUSTOMER DISPUTE  PURSUIT OF PETROCHEMICAL AND INDUSTRIAL FABRICATION WORK  - WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON PETROCHEMICAL AND INDUSTRIAL FABRICATION OPPORTUNITIES IN RESPONSE TO THE DEPRESSED OFFSHORE FABRICATION MARKET.  ALTHOUGH OUR PURSUIT OF CERTAIN LARGE PROJECT OPPORTUNITIES HAS BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE TIMING AND DELAY OF SUCH OPPORTUNITIES AND THE COMPETITIVE MARKET ENVIRONMENT, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SUCCESS WITH SEVERAL SMALLER PROJECT OPPORTUNITIES, AND OUR VOLUME OF BIDDING ACTIVITY FOR ONSHORE MODULES AND STRUCTURES CONTINUES TO BE AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE WE COMMENCED OUR INITIATIVE. IN ADDITION, DURING 2018 WE COMPLETED THE FABRICATION AND TIMELY DELIVERY OF FOUR LARGE MODULES FOR A NEW PETROCHEMICAL FACILITY IN THE U.S., PROVIDING INCREASED CONFIDENCE TO OUR CUSTOMERS THAT WE CAN SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE AND EXECUTE IN THE ONSHORE FABRICATION MARKET.  PURSUIT OF OFFSHORE WIND  - WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT FUTURE REQUIREMENTS TO PROVIDE ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLE AND GREEN SOURCES WILL RESULT IN GROWTH OF OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS.  FURTHER, WE BELIEVE WE POSSESS THE EXPERTISE AND RELATIONSHIPS TO SUCCESSFULLY PARTICIPATE IN THIS GROWING MARKET.  DURING 2015, WE FABRICATED WIND TURBINE FOUNDATIONS FOR THE FIRST OFFSHORE WIND POWER PROJECT IN THE U.S., AND DURING 2018, WE FABRICATED A METEOROLOGICAL TOWER AND PLATFORM FOR AN OFFSHORE WIND PROJECT LOCATED OFF THE U.S.  -  20  -  COAST OF MARYLAND. THESE PROJECTS DEMONSTRATE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE STRUCTURES FOR THIS EMERGING INDUSTRY. WE ARE ALSO STRENGTHENING OUR PROJECT MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES TO SUPPORT POTENTIAL OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS AND, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER 2019, EXECUTED A COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH SMULDERS TO JOINTLY PURSUE U.S. OFFSHORE WIND OPPORTUNITIES. SMULDERS, A BELGIAN COMPANY, IS A MAJOR FABRICATION SUPPLIER OF OFFSHORE WIND STRUCTURES IN EUROPE. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE SUCH A RELATIONSHIP WILL HELP TO STRATEGICALLY POSITION US IN OUR PURSUIT OF OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS, WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL SUCCESSFULLY OBTAIN FUTURE PROJECT AWARDS AS A RESULT OF THIS ARRANGEMENT.  DIVERSIFICATION AND GROWTH OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE -  WE ARE CONTINUING TO DIVERSIFY OUR CUSTOMER BASE WITHIN OUR OPERATING DIVISIONS.  \u2022  SHIPYARD DIVISION  - WITHIN OUR SHIPYARD DIVISION WE HAVE INCREASED OUR BACKLOG WITH CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR.  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , PROJECTS IN OUR BACKLOG INCLUDE.  \u2013  THE CONSTRUCTION OF THREE TOWING, SALVAGE AND RESCUE SHIPS (INDIVIDUAL PROJECT VALUES OF APPROXIMATELY $64.0 MILLION), WITH CUSTOMER OPTIONS FOR FIVE ADDITIONAL VESSELS;  \u2013  THE CONSTRUCTION OF THREE REGIONAL CLASS RESEARCH VESSELS (INDIVIDUAL PROJECT VALUES OF APPROXIMATELY $69.0 TO $77.0 MILLION);  \u2013  THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SEVENTY-VEHICLE FERRY; AND  \u2013  THE CONSTRUCTION OF FIVE HARBOR TUG VESSELS.  \u2022  FABRICATION DIVISION -  WITHIN OUR FABRICATION DIVISION WE HAVE INCREASED OUR BACKLOG WITH TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL FABRICATION WORK AS WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE PETROCHEMICAL AND INDUSTRIAL FABRICATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR MODULES AND STRUCTURES.  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , PROJECTS IN OUR BACKLOG INCLUDE.  \u2013  THE FABRICATION OF AN OFFSHORE JACKET AND DECK (DESTINED FOR TRINIDAD);  \u2013  THE EXPANSION AND DELIVERY OF A 245-GUEST PADDLE WHEEL RIVERBOAT. THE RIVERBOAT WILL BE RECONFIGURED USING THE EXISTING HULL OF A FORMER GAMING VESSEL; AND  \u2013  THE CONSTRUCTION OF TWO, FORTY-VEHICLE FERRIES.  THESE PROJECTS REPRESENT LARGE STEEL STRUCTURES THAT ARE WELL SUITED FOR OUR FABRICATION YARD IN HOUMA, LOUISIANA.  \u2022  SERVICES DIVISION  - WITHIN OUR SERVICES DIVISION OUR ACTIVITY HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY THE TIMING OF NEW PROJECT AWARDS AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.   FURTHER, IN RECENT PERIODS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF LOWER MARGIN MAINTENANCE WORK AND MATERIAL SALES COMPARED TO SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH OFFSHORE TIE-BACKS AND FABRICATED PRODUCTS, WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY PROVIDED HIGHER MARGIN OPPORTUNITIES.  WE ANTICIPATE THIS RECENT MIX OF WORK WILL CONTINUE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  ALTHOUGH VISIBILITY BEYOND 2019 IS UNCERTAIN, AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE TIMING AND MIX OF WORK ARE NORMAL, WE BELIEVE THAT THE OVERALL MARKET DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY THIS DIVISION IS STRONG.  WE ARE CONTINUING TO PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OFFSHORE AND ONSHORE PLANT EXPANSION AND MAINTENANCE WORK, AND WE ARE RECEIVING INDICATIONS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS THAT THE NEED FOR OFFSHORE TIE-BACKS AND FABRICATED PRODUCTS IS INCREASING.  MPSV CONTRACTS DISPUTE  - DURING THE FIRST QUARTER 2018,  WE RECEIVED NOTICES OF TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACTS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF  TWO  MPSVS FROM ONE OF OUR SHIPYARD DIVISION CUSTOMERS.  WE DISPUTE THE PURPORTED TERMINATIONS AND DISAGREE WITH THE CUSTOMER\u2019S REASONS FOR SUCH TERMINATIONS. PENDING THE RESOLUTION OF THE DISPUTE, WE HAVE CEASED ALL WORK, AND THE PARTIALLY COMPLETED VESSELS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS REMAIN AT OUR SHIPYARD IN HOUMA, LOUISIANA. THE CUSTOMER ALSO MADE CLAIMS UNDER THE BONDS ISSUED BY THE SURETY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE VESSELS.  WE HAVE DISCUSSED WITH THE SURETY OUR DISAGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER\u2019S PURPORTED TERMINATIONS AND ITS CLAIMS AND CONTINUE TO CONFER WITH THE SURETY REGARDING THE DISPUTE WITH THE CUSTOMER.  ON OCTOBER 2, 2018, WE FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE CUSTOMER TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UNDER THE APPLICABLE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS. OUR LAWSUIT DISPUTES THE PROPRIETY OF THE CUSTOMER\u2019S PURPORTED TERMINATIONS OF THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS AND SEEKS TO RECOVER DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CUSTOMER\u2019S ACTIONS. THE CUSTOMER FILED ITS RESPONSE TO OUR LAWSUIT DENYING MANY OF THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE LAWSUIT AND ASSERTING A COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST US SEEKING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DECLARATORY JUDGMENT AS TO THE VALIDITY OF THE CUSTOMER'S PURPORTED TERMINATIONS OF THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS AND OTHER PURPORTED CLAIMS FOR WHICH THE CUSTOMER IS SEEKING DAMAGES IN AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT. WE FILED A RESPONSE TO THE COUNTERCLAIM DENYING ALL OF THE CUSTOMER'S CLAIMS. THE CUSTOMER SUBSEQUENTLY FILED A MOTION WITH THE COURT SEEKING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE VESSELS. A HEARING ON THAT MOTION WAS HELD ON MAY 28, 2019, AND THE CUSTOMER'S REQUEST TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE VESSELS WAS DENIED BY THE COURT. THE CUSTOMER RECENTLY FILED AN AMENDMENT TO ITS COUNTERCLAIM TO ADD CLAIMS BY THE CUSTOMER AGAINST THE SURETY.  THE CUSTOMER ALSO RECENTLY FILED A SECOND MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT RE-URGING ITS PREVIOUSLY DENIED REQUEST TO OBTAIN POSSESSION OF THE  -  21  -  VESSELS.  A HEARING ON THE SECOND MOTION IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 5, 2019.  DISCOVERY IN CONNECTION WITH THE LAWSUIT IS UNDERWAY.  WE ARE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY OF A FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME WITH RESPECT TO THE DISPUTE OR ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL LOSS, IF ANY, RELATED TO THIS MATTER. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS AS WE PURSUE OUR RIGHTS AND REMEDIES UNDER THE CONTRACTS AND DEFEND AGAINST THE CUSTOMER\u2019S CLAIMS. AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET INCLUDED A NET CONTRACT ASSET OF  $12.5 MILLION  RELATED TO THESE PROJECTS. SEE  \"LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\"  IN PART II, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT AND NOTE 5 OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR DISPUTE.  REVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES  ON NOVEMBER 4, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED THE COMPLETION OF OUR PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED REVIEW OF ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES THAT BEGAN IN EARLY MAY 2019.  OPERATING OUTLOOK  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE AFFECTED PROSPECTIVELY BY THE OVERALL DEMAND AND MARKET FOR OUR SERVICES. FURTHER, OUR SUCCESS IN STRATEGICALLY REPOSITIONING THE COMPANY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FABRICATION OF PETROCHEMICAL AND INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES, PURSUE OFFSHORE WIND OPPORTUNITIES AND DIVERSIFY OUR CUSTOMER BASE WITHIN ALL OF OUR OPERATING DIVISIONS, WILL BE DETERMINED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  THE LEVEL OF CONSTRUCTION AND FABRICATION PROJECTS IN THE NEW MARKETS WE ARE PURSUING FOR OUR FABRICATION DIVISION, INCLUDING PETROCHEMICAL AND INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES AND OFFSHORE WIND DEVELOPMENTS, AND OUR ABILITY TO SECURE NEW PROJECT AWARDS;  \u2022  CONTINUED GROWTH WITHIN OUR SHIPYARD AND SERVICES DIVISIONS;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO SECURE NEW PROJECT AWARDS THROUGH COMPETITIVE BIDDING AND/OR ALLIANCE AND PARTNERING ARRANGEMENTS;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE PROJECTS WITHIN OUR COST ESTIMATES AND SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE THEM THROUGH COMPLETION; AND  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO RESOLVE OUR DISPUTE WITH OUR CUSTOMER RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF TWO MPSVS.  WE CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY AND ACTIVELY COMPETE FOR ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. OUR FOCUS REMAINS ON MAINTAINING OUR LIQUIDITY AND SECURING MEANINGFUL NEW PROJECT AWARDS AND BACKLOG IN THE NEAR-TERM AND GENERATING OPERATING INCOME AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS IN THE LONGER-TERM. ALTHOUGH WE EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN BACKLOG FOR OUR FABRICATION AND SHIPYARD DIVISIONS DURING THE  THIRD QUARTER  2019  , WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL SECURING NEW PROJECT AWARDS AND GROWING OUR BACKLOG IN THE FUTURE.  FURTHER, WE ARE EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED UTILIZATION OF OUR SHIPYARD FACILITIES AS WE RAMP UP CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES FOR OUR LARGE PROJECTS IN BACKLOG; HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR FABRICATION DIVISION WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN THE NEAR-TERM BY THE UNDERUTILIZATION OF ITS FACILITIES DUE TO THE DELAY IN TIMING OF NEW PROJECT AWARDS. BOTH DIVISIONS WILL ALSO BE IMPACTED BY LOWER MARGIN BACKLOG RELATED TO PREVIOUS PROJECT AWARDS BID AT COMPETITIVE PRICING. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN PROJECTS WITHIN OUR BACKLOG ARE IN A LOSS POSITION, AND THE PROJECTS WILL RESULT IN FUTURE REVENUE WITH NO GROSS PROFIT.  SAFETY  WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE SAFETY AND HEALTH OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND SUBCONTRACTORS. WE BELIEVE THAT A STRONG SAFETY CULTURE IS A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF OUR SUCCESS. WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AND MAINTAIN A STRINGENT SAFETY ASSURANCE PROGRAM DESIGNED TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND ALLOW US TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE MANDATED SAFETY REGULATIONS.  WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A WELL-TRAINED WORKFORCE AND PROVIDING TIMELY INSTRUCTION TO ENSURE OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO PERFORM THEIR WORK SAFELY WHILE MAINTAINING THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF QUALITY. WE PROVIDE CONTINUOUS SAFETY EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO EMPLOYEES AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO ENSURE THEY ARE READY FOR THE CHALLENGES INHERENT IN ALL OUR PROJECTS. OUR EMPLOYEES COMMENCE TRAINING ON THEIR FIRST DAY OF EMPLOYMENT WITH A COMPREHENSIVE ORIENTATION CLASS THAT ADDRESSES COMPANY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND PROVIDES CLEAR EXPECTATIONS FOR WORKING SAFELY. WE HAVE A ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY FOR DRUGS AND ALCOHOL USE IN THE WORKPLACE. WE SUPPORT THIS POLICY THROUGH THE USE OF A COMPREHENSIVE DRUG AND ALCOHOL SCREENING PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES INITIAL SCREENINGS FOR ALL EMPLOYEES AND PERIODIC RANDOM SCREENINGS THROUGHOUT EMPLOYMENT. ADDITIONALLY, WE REQUIRE OUR SUBCONTRACTORS TO FOLLOW ALCOHOL AND DRUG SCREENING POLICIES SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS OURS.  -  22  -  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  FOR A DISCUSSION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, REFER TO  \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d  IN ITEM 7 INCLUDED IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT. THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES SINCE  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  NEW PROJECT AWARDS AND BACKLOG  NEW PROJECT AWARDS REPRESENT EXPECTED REVENUE VALUES OF COMMITMENTS RECEIVED DURING A GIVEN PERIOD, INCLUDING SCOPE GROWTH ON EXISTING COMMITMENTS. A COMMITMENT REPRESENTS AUTHORIZATION FROM OUR CUSTOMER TO BEGIN WORK OR PURCHASE MATERIALS PURSUANT TO A WRITTEN AGREEMENT, LETTER OF INTENT OR OTHER FORM OF AUTHORIZATION. BACKLOG REPRESENTS THE UNEARNED VALUE OF OUR NEW PROJECT AWARDS AND MAY DIFFER FROM THE VALUE OF REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS FOR OUR CONTRACTS REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED UNDER TOPIC 606 AND PRESENTED IN NOTE 2 OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN GENERAL, A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS A CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO CONSTRUCT AND/OR TRANSFER A DISTINCT GOOD OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER. THE TRANSACTION PRICE OF A CONTRACT IS ALLOCATED TO EACH DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN, OR AS, THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED. BACKLOG INCLUDES OUR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , PLUS SIGNED CONTRACTS THAT ARE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED OR UNDER PROTEST THAT MAY NOT MEET THE CRITERIA TO BE REPORTED AS FUTURE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS UNDER TOPIC 606 BUT REPRESENT FUTURE WORK THAT WE BELIEVE WILL BE PERFORMED. WE BELIEVE THAT BACKLOG, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS.

CREDIT FACILITIES  CREDIT AGREEMENT  - WE HAVE A  $40.0 MILLION  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH HANCOCK WHITNEY BANK (\"CREDIT AGREEMENT\") THAT CAN BE USED FOR BORROWINGS OR LETTERS OF CREDIT. ON MAY 1, 2019, WE AMENDED OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT TO EXTEND ITS MATURITY DATE TO JUNE 9, 2021 AND AMEND CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS.  OUR AMENDED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL COVENANTS FOR THE REMAINING TERM OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  RATIO OF CURRENT ASSETS TO CURRENT LIABILITIES OF NOT LESS THAN  2.00  :1.00;  \u2022  MINIMUM TANGIBLE NET WORTH OF AT LEAST THE SUM OF  $170.0 MILLION  , PLUS 100% OF THE NET PROCEEDS FROM ANY ISSUANCE OF STOCK OR OTHER EQUITY AFTER DEDUCTING ANY FEES, COMMISSIONS, EXPENSES AND OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN SUCH OFFERING; AND  \u2022  RATIO OF FUNDED DEBT (WHICH INCLUDES OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT) TO TANGIBLE NET WORTH OF NOT MORE THAN  0.50  :1.00.  -  36  -  OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES RESTRICTIONS REGARDING OUR ABILITY TO: (I) GRANT LIENS; (II) MAKE CERTAIN LOANS OR INVESTMENTS; (III) INCUR ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS OR GUARANTEE OTHER INDEBTEDNESS IN EXCESS OF SPECIFIED LEVELS; (IV) MAKE ANY MATERIAL CHANGE TO THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS OR UNDERGO A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE; (V) MAKE ANY MATERIAL DISPOSITIONS; (VI) ACQUIRE ANOTHER COMPANY OR ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS ASSETS; (VII) ENTER INTO A MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, OR SALE LEASEBACK TRANSACTION; OR (VIII) DECLARE AND PAY DIVIDENDS IF ANY POTENTIAL DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT OCCURS.  INTEREST ON BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT MAY BE DESIGNATED, AT OUR OPTION, AS EITHER THE  WALL STREET JOURNAL  PUBLISHED PRIME RATE (  5.0%  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  ) OR LIBOR (  2.0%  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  ) PLUS  2.0%  PER ANNUM. COMMITMENT FEES ON THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE  0.4%  PER ANNUM, AND INTEREST ON OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT IS  2.0%  PER ANNUM. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OUR ASSETS (WITH A NEGATIVE PLEDGE ON OUR REAL PROPERTY).  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD  NO  OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND  $10.4 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT, PROVIDING  $29.6 MILLION  OF AVAILABLE CAPACITY.  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL COVENANTS, WITH A TANGIBLE NET WORTH OF  $185.2 MILLION  (AS DEFINED BY THE CREDIT AGREEMENT), A RATIO OF CURRENT ASSETS TO CURRENT LIABILITIES OF  2.11  :1.00 AND A RATIO OF FUNDED DEBT TO TANGIBLE NET WORTH OF  0.06  :1.00.  SURETY BONDS  - WE ISSUE SURETY BONDS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO SUPPORT OUR PROJECTS.  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD  $409.3 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING SURETY BONDS.  ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THERE IS SUFFICIENT BONDING CAPACITY AVAILABLE TO US FROM ONE OR MORE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, SUCH CAPACITY IS UNCOMMITTED, AND ACCORDINGLY, WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCES THAT NECESSARY BONDING CAPACITY WILL BE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT OUR FUTURE BONDING REQUIREMENTS.  LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK  AS DISCUSSED IN OUR OVERVIEW, WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON MAINTAINING LIQUIDITY AND SECURING MEANINGFUL NEW PROJECT AWARDS AND BACKLOG IN THE NEAR-TERM AND GENERATING OPERATING INCOME AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS IN THE LONGER-TERM. WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN OUR EFFORTS TO INCREASE OUR BACKLOG AND IMPROVE AND PRESERVE OUR LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING COST REDUCTIONS (INCLUDING REDUCING THE COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS) AND THE SALE OF UNDERUTILIZED ASSETS. IN ADDITION, AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE CONTINUE TO HAVE  $18.5 MILLION  OF ASSETS HELD FOR SALE; HOWEVER, WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL SUCCESSFULLY SELL THESE ASSETS OR THAT WE WILL RECOVER THEIR CARRYING VALUE. THE PRIMARY USES OF OUR LIQUIDITY FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AND THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE ARE TO FUND.  \u2022  THE UNDERUTILIZATION OF OUR FACILITIES WITHIN OUR FABRICATION DIVISION, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT WITHIN OUR SHIPYARD DIVISION, UNTIL WE SECURE AND/OR BEGIN TO EXECUTE SUFFICIENT BACKLOG TO FULLY RECOVER OUR OVERHEAD COSTS;  \u2022  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (INCLUDING POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR SHIPYARD DIVISION FACILITIES AND INVESTMENTS IN OUR FABRICATION DIVISION FACILITIES TO WIN AND EXECUTE POTENTIAL OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS);  \u2022  ACCRUED CONTRACT LOSSES RECORDED AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  ;  \u2022  WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR PROJECTS (INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL PROJECTS FOR THE U.S. NAVY IF THE AFOREMENTIONED OPTIONS ARE EXERCISED); AND  \u2022  CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES.  WE ANTICIPATE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $2.0 MILLION TO $3.0 MILLION FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019.  IF CONDITIONS FOR THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY DO NOT IMPROVE, WE ARE UNABLE TO INCREASE OUR BACKLOG, WE ARE UNABLE TO DIVERSIFY OUR CUSTOMER BASE, OR WE ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN OUR STRATEGIC REPOSITIONING OF THE COMPANY, WE WOULD TAKE ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO REDUCE COSTS AND PRESERVE OUR LIQUIDITY UNTIL WE ARE ABLE TO GENERATE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE US TO FUND OUR OPERATING EXPENSES, MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS, AND SATISFY ANY DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS OR OTHER FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, FOR AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF THIS REPORT. OUR EVALUATION OF THE SUFFICIENCY OF OUR CASH AND LIQUIDITY IS PRIMARILY BASED ON OUR FINANCIAL FORECAST FOR 2019 AND 2020, WHICH IS IMPACTED BY OUR EXISTING BACKLOG AND ESTIMATES OF FUTURE NEW PROJECT AWARDS. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCES THAT OUR FINANCIAL FORECAST WILL BE ACHIEVED OR THAT WE WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH OR AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT TO MEET PLANNED OPERATING EXPENSES AND OTHER UNFORESEEN CASH REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN NEW OR ADDITIONAL CREDIT FACILITIES, SELL ADDITIONAL ASSETS OR CONDUCT EQUITY OR DEBT OFFERINGS AT A TIME WHEN IT IS NOT BENEFICIAL TO DO SO.  -  37  -  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES FROM THE INFORMATION INCLUDED IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT.

THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS REPORTED FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES AND ARE DEEMED CRITICAL TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION ARE DISCUSSED IN THE \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d SECTION OF PART II, ITEM 7 \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d IN THE 2019 ANNUAL REPORT.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS OF ANALYSIS OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS AND ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS REFER TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE ANALYSIS OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, WHICH PROVIDES A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION CONCERNING CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.  THE FOLLOWING REFERENCES ARE UTILIZED IN THE DISCUSSIONS OF ANALYSIS OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS AND ANALYSIS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.  \u201cAMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES AND PURCHASED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\u201d AND \u201cACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS\u201d REPRESENT CERTAIN NON-CASH AMORTIZATION EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PURCHASED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSETS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN TRANSACTION AND INTEGRATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES, RESPECTIVELY.  \u201cNET NEW BUSINESS\u201d REFERS TO RECURRING REVENUE FROM CLOSED SALES LESS RECURRING REVENUE FROM CLIENT LOSSES.  THE FOLLOWING DEFINITIONS DESCRIBE THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES.  FEE REVENUES IN THE INVESTOR COMMUNICATION SOLUTIONS SEGMENT ARE DERIVED FROM BOTH RECURRING AND EVENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION, THE LEVEL OF RECURRING AND EVENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY WE PROCESS DIRECTLY IMPACTS DISTRIBUTION REVENUES. WHILE EVENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY IS HIGHLY REPEATABLE, IT MAY NOT RECUR ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THE TYPES OF SERVICES WE PROVIDE THAT COMPRISE EVENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY ARE.  \u2022  MUTUAL FUND PROXY: THE PROXY AND RELATED SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO MUTUAL FUNDS WHEN CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR REQUIRING A SHAREHOLDER VOTE INCLUDING CHANGES IN DIRECTORS, SUB-ADVISORS, FEE STRUCTURES, INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS, AND MERGERS OF FUNDS.  \u2022  MUTUAL FUND COMMUNICATIONS: MUTUAL FUND COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF THE DISTRIBUTION ON BEHALF OF MUTUAL FUNDS OF SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED TO THE ANNUAL MUTUAL FUND PROSPECTUS AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS SUCH AS A CHANGE IN PORTFOLIO MANAGERS. IN ADDITION, MUTUAL FUND COMMUNICATIONS CONSIST OF NOTICES AND MARKETING MATERIALS SUCH AS NEWSLETTERS.  \u2022  EQUITY PROXY CONTESTS AND SPECIALS, CORPORATE ACTIONS, AND OTHER: THE PROXY SERVICES WE PROVIDE IN CONNECTION WITH SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS DRIVEN BY SPECIAL EVENTS SUCH AS PROXY CONTESTS, MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, AND TENDER/EXCHANGE OFFERS.  EVENT-DRIVEN FEE REVENUES ARE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SPECIAL EVENTS AND CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS WE PROCESS. EVENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY IS IMPACTED BY FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND CHANGES IN REGULATORY COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS, RESULTING IN FLUCTUATIONS IN THE TIMING AND LEVELS OF EVENT-DRIVEN FEE REVENUES. AS SUCH, THE TIMING AND LEVEL OF EVENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON REVENUES AND EARNINGS ARE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST.  GENERALLY, MUTUAL FUND PROXY ACTIVITY HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO A GREATER LEVEL OF VOLATILITY THAN THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF EVENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, MUTUAL FUND PROXY FEE REVENUES WERE 61% LOWER COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. DURING THE FISCAL YEARS 2019, MUTUAL FUND PROXY FEE REVENUES WERE 14% LOWER THAN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. ALTHOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE LEVELS OF EVENT-DRIVEN ACTIVITY, WE EXPECT THAT THE PORTION OF FEE REVENUES DERIVED FROM MUTUAL FUND PROXY ACTIVITY MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY IN THE FUTURE.  DISTRIBUTION REVENUES PRIMARILY INCLUDE REVENUES RELATED TO THE PHYSICAL MAILING OF PROXY MATERIALS, INTERIM COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSACTION REPORTING, CUSTOMER COMMUNICATIONS AND FULFILLMENT SERVICES, AS WELL AS MATRIX ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES.  DISTRIBUTION COST OF REVENUES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF POSTAGE-RELATED EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INVESTOR COMMUNICATION SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, AS WELL AS MATRIX ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES EXPENSES. THESE COSTS ARE REFLECTED IN COST OF REVENUES.  CLOSED SALES REPRESENT AN ESTIMATE OF THE EXPECTED ANNUAL RECURRING FEE REVENUE FOR NEW CLIENT CONTRACTS THAT WERE SIGNED BY BROADRIDGE IN THE CURRENT REPORTING PERIOD. CLOSED SALES DOES NOT INCLUDE EVENT-DRIVEN OR DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITY. WE CONSIDER CONTRACT TERMS, EXPECTED CLIENT VOLUMES OR ACTIVITY, KNOWLEDGE OF THE MARKETPLACE AND EXPERIENCE WITH OUR CLIENTS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WHEN DETERMINING THE ESTIMATE. MANAGEMENT USES CLOSED SALES TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING PROGRAMS, AS AN INDICATOR OF EXPECTED FUTURE REVENUES AND AS A PERFORMANCE METRIC IN DETERMINING INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  CLOSED SALES IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR REVENUE OR OTHER INCOME STATEMENT DATA PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. CLOSED SALES IS A USEFUL METRIC FOR INVESTORS IN UNDERSTANDING HOW MANAGEMENT MEASURES AND EVALUATES OUR ONGOING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE INHERENT VARIABILITY OF TRANSACTION VOLUMES AND ACTIVITY LEVELS CAN RESULT IN SOME VARIABILITY OF AMOUNTS REPORTED AS ACTUAL ACHIEVED CLOSED SALES. LARGER CLOSED SALES CAN TAKE UP TO 12 TO 24 MONTHS OR LONGER TO CONVERT TO REVENUES, PARTICULARLY FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY OUR GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS SEGMENT. WE REPORT CLOSED SALES NET OF A 4.0% ALLOWANCE ADJUSTMENT. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR REPORTED CLOSED SALES AMOUNTS WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED FOR ACTUAL REVENUES ACHIEVED BECAUSE THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE ESTIMATED IN THE PERIOD THE SALE IS REPORTED. WE ASSESS THIS ALLOWANCE AMOUNT AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR TO ESTABLISH THE APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE FOR THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR USING THE TRAILING FIVE YEARS ACTUAL DATA AS THE STARTING POINT, NORMALIZED FOR OUTLYING FACTORS, IF ANY, TO ENHANCE THE ACCURACY OF THE ALLOWANCE.  CLOSED SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE $37.6 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $19.2 MILLION OR 103%, COMPARED TO $18.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

INTEREST EXPENSE, NET WAS $13.1 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $3.5 MILLION, FROM $9.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

THE PRIMARY COMPONENT OF \u201cOTHER\u201d ARE CERTAIN GAINS, LOSSES, CORPORATE OVERHEAD EXPENSES AND NON-OPERATING EXPENSES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, SUCH AS INTEREST EXPENSE. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE IS A RECONCILING ITEM BETWEEN THE ACTUAL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND THE CONSTANT FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES USED FOR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING.  CERTAIN CORPORATE EXPENSES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN CENTRALLY MANAGED EXPENSES, ARE ALLOCATED BASED UPON BUDGETED AMOUNTS IN A REASONABLE MANNER. BECAUSE THE COMPANY COMPENSATES THE MANAGEMENT OF ITS VARIOUS BUSINESSES ON, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, SEGMENT PROFIT, THE COMPANY MAY ELECT TO RECORD CERTAIN SEGMENT-RELATED OPERATING AND NON-OPERATING EXPENSE ITEMS IN OTHER RATHER THAN REFLECT SUCH ITEMS IN SEGMENT PROFIT.  IN CONNECTION WITH AN ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MADE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, IN ORDER TO FURTHER ALIGN OUR PORTFOLIO OF SERVICES, THE RESULTS FOR THE COMPANY'S WEALTH MANAGEMENT ADVISOR SOLUTIONS SERVICES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN OUR INVESTOR COMMUNICATION SOLUTIONS REPORTABLE SEGMENT ARE NOW REPORTED WITHIN THE GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONS REPORTABLE SEGMENT. AS A RESULT, OUR PRIOR PERIOD SEGMENT RESULTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 HAVE BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THIS CHANGE, WHICH RESULTED IN TRANSFERRING $10.7 MILLION OF REVENUES AND $0.2 MILLION OF EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.

EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q ARE PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP EXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE NOTED. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, RESULTS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED THAT ARE NOT GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES MEASURES (\u201cNON-GAAP\u201d). THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME, ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME MARGIN, ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS, ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, AND FREE CASH FLOW. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD BE VIEWED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, THE COMPANY\u2019S REPORTED RESULTS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES HELP INVESTORS UNDERSTAND HOW MANAGEMENT PLANS, MEASURES AND EVALUATES THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT NON-GAAP MEASURES PROVIDE CONSISTENCY IN ITS FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FACILITATES INVESTORS\u2019 UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING RESULTS AND TRENDS BY PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL BASIS FOR COMPARISON. MANAGEMENT USES THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EVALUATE OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS, FOR INTERNAL PLANNING AND FORECASTING PURPOSES AND IN THE CALCULATION OF PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION. IN ADDITION, AND AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN MANAGING OUR BUSINESS, THE COMPANY\u2019S COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCORPORATES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THE EVALUATION PROCESS FOR DETERMINING MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION.  ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME, ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME MARGIN, ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE  THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES REFLECT OPERATING INCOME, OPERATING INCOME MARGIN, NET EARNINGS, AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, AS ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN COSTS, EXPENSES, GAINS AND LOSSES AND OTHER SPECIFIED ITEMS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATING PERFORMANCE. THESE ADJUSTED MEASURES EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF: (I) AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES AND PURCHASED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND (II) ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES AND PURCHASED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REPRESENTS NON-CASH AMORTIZATION EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES. ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS REPRESENT CERTAIN TRANSACTION AND INTEGRATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES.  WE EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES AND PURCHASED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AS THESE NON-CASH AMOUNTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE TIMING AND SIZE OF INDIVIDUAL ACQUISITIONS AND DO NOT FACTOR INTO THE COMPANY\u2019S CAPITAL ALLOCATION DECISIONS, MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION METRICS OR MULTI-YEAR OBJECTIVES. FURTHERMORE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THIS ADJUSTMENT ENABLES BETTER COMPARISON OF OUR RESULTS AS AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES AND PURCHASED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL NOT RECUR IN FUTURE PERIODS ONCE SUCH INTANGIBLE ASSETS HAVE BEEN FULLY AMORTIZED. ALTHOUGH WE EXCLUDE AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES AND PURCHASED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM OUR ADJUSTED EARNINGS MEASURES, OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR INVESTORS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTRIBUTE TO REVENUE GENERATION. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT RELATE TO PAST ACQUISITIONS WILL RECUR IN FUTURE PERIODS UNTIL SUCH INTANGIBLE ASSETS HAVE BEEN FULLY AMORTIZED. ANY FUTURE ACQUISITIONS MAY RESULT IN THE AMORTIZATION OF ADDITIONAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  FREE CASH FLOW  IN ADDITION TO THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE PROVIDE FREE CASH FLOW INFORMATION BECAUSE WE CONSIDER FREE CASH FLOW TO BE A LIQUIDITY MEASURE THAT PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF CASH GENERATED THAT COULD BE USED FOR DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, OTHER INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS DEBT SERVICING. FREE CASH FLOW IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND IS DEFINED BY THE COMPANY AS NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS WELL AS SOFTWARE PURCHASES AND CAPITALIZED INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE.

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, NET WORKING CAPITAL WAS $54.3 MILLION COMPARED TO $239.8 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2019. AT THE CURRENT TIME, AND IN FUTURE PERIODS, WE EXPECT CASH GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND BORROWINGS FROM THE CAPITAL MARKETS, TO BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER CASH NEEDS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, DIVIDENDS AND COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, $90.2 MILLION OF THE $358.3 MILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, AND $84.4 MILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE HELD BY REGULATED ENTITIES.  WE EXPECT EXISTING DOMESTIC CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR DOMESTIC OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS, DEBT REPAYMENT SCHEDULES, AND MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT EXISTING FOREIGN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWING CAPACITY TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR FOREIGN OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IF THESE FUNDS ARE NEEDED FOR OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOREIGN TAXES TO REPATRIATE THESE FUNDS. HOWEVER, WHILE WE MAY DO SO AT A FUTURE DATE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT NEED TO REPATRIATE FUTURE FOREIGN EARNINGS TO FUND U.S. OPERATIONS.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AND AVAILABLE CAPACITY UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

THE INCREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $70.0 MILLION IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, PRIMARILY REFLECTS AN INCREASE IN CASH USED IN RECENT ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER RELATED INVESTMENTS.  THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $203.9 MILLION IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 PRIMARILY REFLECTS AN INCREASE IN DEBT PROCEEDS, NET OF DEBT REPAYMENTS, AND HIGHER PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DIVIDENDS PAID.  SEASONALITY  PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTING PROXY MATERIALS AND ANNUAL REPORTS TO INVESTORS COMPRISES A LARGE PORTION OF OUR INVESTOR COMMUNICATION SOLUTIONS BUSINESS. WE PROCESS AND DISTRIBUTE THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PROXY MATERIALS AND ANNUAL REPORTS DURING OUR THIRD AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS. THE RECURRING PERIODIC ACTIVITY OF THIS BUSINESS IS LINKED TO SIGNIFICANT FILING DEADLINES IMPOSED BY LAW ON PUBLIC REPORTING COMPANIES. HISTORICALLY, THIS HAS CAUSED OUR REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME, NET EARNINGS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO BE HIGHER IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER THAN IN ANY OTHER QUARTER. BEGINNING ON JULY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU NO. 2014-09, RESULTING IN THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES FROM EQUITY PROXY SERVICES BEING RECOGNIZED IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE IMPACT OF ASU NO. 2014-09, THE SEASONALITY OF OUR REVENUES MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS BASED ON THE RESULTS OF ANY SPECIFIC FISCAL QUARTER AND COULD AFFECT AN INVESTOR\u2019S ABILITY TO COMPARE OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND CASH FLOWS ON A FISCAL QUARTER-BY-QUARTER BASIS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  IN MARCH 2010, THE COMPANY AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION (\u201cIBM\u201d) ENTERED INTO AN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES AGREEMENT (THE \u201cIT SERVICES AGREEMENT\u201d), UNDER WHICH IBM PROVIDES CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. UNDER THE IT SERVICES AGREEMENT, IBM PROVIDES A BROAD RANGE OF TECHNOLOGY SERVICES TO THE COMPANY INCLUDING SUPPORTING ITS MAINFRAME, MIDRANGE, OPEN SYSTEMS, NETWORK AND DATA CENTER OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS PROVIDING DISASTER RECOVERY SERVICES. THE COMPANY HAS THE OPTION OF INCORPORATING ADDITIONAL SERVICES INTO THE AGREEMENT OVER TIME. THE MIGRATION OF DATA CENTER PROCESSING TO IBM WAS COMPLETED IN AUGUST 2012. THE IT SERVICES AGREEMENT WOULD HAVE EXPIRED ON JUNE 30, 2022. IN MARCH 2015, THE COMPANY SIGNED A TWO-YEAR EXTENSION TO THE IT SERVICES AGREEMENT WHICH EXPIRES ON JUNE 30, 2024. THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO RENEW THE TERM OF THE IT SERVICES AGREEMENT FOR UP TO ONE ADDITIONAL 12-MONTH TERM.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  A DESCRIPTION OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN THE MD&A SECTION OF OUR  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  FILED WITH THE SEC ON  FEBRUARY 26, 2019  UNDER THE HEADING \u201cAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d. THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR THE ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS UTILIZED IN APPLYING THESE POLICIES SINCE  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS  TO SUPPLEMENT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, WE USE CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, SUCH AS OPERATING NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS, OPERATING EARNINGS PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE, RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY, RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE ASSETS, TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE, THE RATIO OF TANGIBLE EQUITY TO TANGIBLE ASSETS, THE RATIO OF TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY TO TANGIBLE ASSETS, EFFICIENCY RATIO AND NET INTEREST MARGIN (FTE) TO PROVIDE INFORMATION USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN UNDERSTANDING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS, AND TO FACILITATE COMPARISONS WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR PEERS. MANAGEMENT USES THESE MEASURES INTERNALLY TO ASSESS AND BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR UNDERLYING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS RELATED TO CORE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS WE USE MAY DIFFER FROM THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS USE TO ASSESS THEIR PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS.  THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD BE VIEWED AS SUPPLEMENTAL IN NATURE, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO, OUR REPORTED RESULTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WHEN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE DISCLOSED, THE SEC'S REGULATION G REQUIRES: (I) THE PRESENTATION OF THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND (II) A RECONCILIATION OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE PRESENTED AND THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP OPERATING MEASURES TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE INCLUDED LATER IN THIS REPORT UNDER THE HEADING \u201cRECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS TO GAAP\u201d.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES CHARGES SUCH AS BRANCH CONSOLIDATION COSTS AND SPECIAL ONE-TIME EMPLOYEE 401(K) CONTRIBUTIONS RELATED TO TAX REFORM ARE NOT ORGANIC COSTS TO RUN OUR OPERATIONS AND FACILITIES. THESE CHARGES ARE CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IMPACTING EARNINGS AS THEY ARE DEEMED TO BE OUTSIDE OF ORDINARY BANKING ACTIVITIES. THE BRANCH CONSOLIDATION CHARGES PRINCIPALLY REPRESENT EXPENSES TO SATISFY CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE CLOSED BRANCHES WITHOUT ANY USEFUL ONGOING BENEFIT TO US. THESE COSTS ARE SPECIFIC TO EACH INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTION, AND MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY BASED ON THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE TRANSACTION. SIMILARLY, GAINS DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF A BUSINESS ARE NOT ORGANIC TO OUR OPERATIONS.  TO PROVIDE MORE MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS OF NET INTEREST MARGIN AND EFFICIENCY RATIO, WE USE NET INTEREST INCOME ON A TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT BASIS IN CALCULATING NET INTEREST MARGIN BY INCREASING THE INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON TAX-EXEMPT ASSETS (LOANS AND INVESTMENTS) TO MAKE IT FULLY EQUIVALENT TO INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON TAXABLE INVESTMENTS (THIS ADJUSTMENT IS NOT PERMITTED UNDER GAAP).  TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT AMOUNTS FOR THE  2019  AND  2018  PERIODS WERE CALCULATED USING A FEDERAL STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATE OF 21%.  FINANCIAL SUMMARY  NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  WAS  $100.7 MILLION  OR  $0.31  PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE, COMPARED TO NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2018  OF  $98.8 MILLION  OR  $0.30  PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE. ON AN OPERATING BASIS,  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS WAS EQUAL TO GAAP/REPORTED AT  $100.7 MILLION  OR  $0.31  PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE, COMPARED TO THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2018  NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS (NON-GAAP) OF  $94.7 MILLION  OR  $0.29  PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE (NON-GAAP), EXCLUDING A $5.1 MILLION GAIN RECOGNIZED FROM THE SALE OF REGENCY.  58  INCOME STATEMENT HIGHLIGHTS (  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2018  , EXCEPT AS NOTED)  \u2022  NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS WAS  $100.7 MILLION  , COMPARED TO  $98.8 MILLION  , UP  2.0%.  \u2022  EARNINGS PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE WERE  $0.31  , COMPARED TO  $0.30  , UP  3.3%.  \u2022  OPERATING EARNINGS PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE (NON-GAAP) WERE  $0.31  , COMPARED TO  $0.29  , UP  6.9%.  \u2022  NET INTEREST MARGIN (FTE) (NON-GAAP) DECLINED  19  BASIS POINTS TO  3.17%  FROM  3.36%  , ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED COST OF FUNDS AND THE SALE OF REGENCY WHICH CONTRIBUTED 8 BASIS POINTS TO NET INTEREST MARGIN IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  INCLUDED  $8.1 MILLION  OF INCREMENTAL PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ACCRETION AND  $0.6 MILLION  OF CASH RECOVERIES, COMPARED TO  $5.9 MILLION  AND  $1.5 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2018.  \u2022  NON-INTEREST INCOME  INCREASED  $5.2 MILLION  , OR  6.9%  . CAPITAL MARKETS INCOME GREW  $3.6 MILLION  , OR  70.8%  , REFLECTING STRONG CUSTOMER-RELATED INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY. MORTGAGE BANKING OPERATIONS INCOME INCREASED  $3.8 MILLION  , OR  63.6%  , DUE TO A $4.1 MILLION INCREASE IN GAIN ON SALE INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $0.3 MILLION INTEREST RATE-RELATED VALUATION ADJUSTMENT ON MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS. INSURANCE COMMISSIONS AND FEES  INCREASED  $1.1 MILLION  , OR  22.8%  , WHILE TRUST INCOME GREW  $0.5 MILLION  , OR  8.4%  . ON AN OPERATING BASIS, NON-INTEREST INCOME INCREASED  $10.3 MILLION  , OR  14.8%  , WHEN EXCLUDING THE $5.1 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF REGENCY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.  \u2022  THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES OF  $11.9 MILLION  SUPPORTED STRONG LOAN GROWTH AND EXCEEDED NET CHARGE-OFFS OF  $6.4 MILLION  . THE LOW LEVEL OF NET CHARGE-OFFS REFLECTS FAVORABLE CREDIT QUALITY.  \u2022  THE ANNUALIZED NET CHARGE-OFFS TO TOTAL AVERAGE LOANS RATIO DECREASED 16 BASIS POINTS TO  0.11%  , COMPARED TO  0.27%  , INDICATIVE OF CONTINUED FAVORABLE CREDIT QUALITY TRENDS AND THE SALE OF REGENCY.  \u2022  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  14.5%  , AND INCLUDES THE BENEFIT OF CERTAIN RENEWABLE ENERGY AND HISTORIC TAX CREDITS REALIZED DURING THE QUARTER, COMPARED TO  18.0%.  \u2022  THE EFFICIENCY RATIO (NON-GAAP) EQUALED  54.1%  , COMPARED TO  53.7%.  \u2022  RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY RATIO (NON-GAAP) WAS  17.41%  , COMPARED TO  19.44%.

WE BELIEVE THIS MEASURE TO BE THE PREFERRED INDUSTRY MEASUREMENT OF NET INTEREST INCOME AND PROVIDES RELEVANT COMPARISON BETWEEN TAXABLE AND NON-TAXABLE AMOUNTS.  INTEREST INCOME ON AN FTE BASIS (NON-GAAP) OF  $317.9 MILLION  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  , INCREASED  $16.7 MILLION  OR  5.6%  FROM THE SAME QUARTER OF  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO  INCREASED  INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS OF  $1.1 BILLION  . THE INCREASE IN INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A  $1.0 BILLION  , OR  4.4%  , INCREASE IN AVERAGE LOANS AND LEASES, WHICH REFLECTS SOLID GROWTH IN THE COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIOS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE SALE OF REGENCY.  AVERAGE COMMERCIAL LOAN GROWTH TOTALED  $789.0 MILLION  , OR  5.8%  , LED BY STRONG COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY IN THE PITTSBURGH, CLEVELAND, CHARLOTTE AND MID-ATLANTIC (GREATER BALTIMORE-WASHINGTON D.C. MARKETS) REGIONS AND CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE EQUIPMENT FINANCE AND ASSET-BASED LENDING BUSINESSES.  AVERAGE CONSUMER LOAN GROWTH WAS  $163.5 MILLION  , OR  2.0%  , AS GROWTH IN INDIRECT AUTO LOANS OF  $126.5 MILLION  , OR  6.9%  , AND RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS OF  $269.4 MILLION  , OR  9.2%  , WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN AVERAGE DIRECT INSTALLMENT LOANS OF  $97.5 MILLION  , OR  5.3%  AND CONSUMER LINES OF CREDIT OF  $135.3 MILLION  , OR  8.3%  AND THE SALE OF REGENCY.  ADDITIONALLY, AVERAGE SECURITIES  DECREASED  $70.0 MILLION  , OR  1.1%  , DUE TO HIGHER LOAN GROWTH IN 2019.  THE YIELD ON AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING  62  ASSETS (NON-GAAP) INCREASED  7  BASIS POINTS FROM THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2018  TO  4.31%  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  . DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  , WE RECOGNIZED  $8.1 MILLION  OF INCREMENTAL PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ACCRETION AND  $0.6 MILLION  OF CASH RECOVERIES, COMPARED TO  $5.9 MILLION  AND  $1.5 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2018.  INTEREST EXPENSE OF  $84.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  INCREASED  $21.6 MILLION  , OR  34.2%  , FROM THE SAME QUARTER OF  2018  , DUE TO AN INCREASE IN RATES PAID ON AVERAGE INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES AND GROWTH IN AVERAGE INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS OVER THE SAME QUARTER OF  2018  .  AVERAGE INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS  INCREASED  $0.7 BILLION  , OR  4.3%  , WHILE AVERAGE NON-INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS  INCREASED  $240.7 MILLION  , OR  4.0%  .  THE GROWTH IN NON-INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS AND INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS WAS LED BY ORGANIC GROWTH IN PERSONAL AND COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS.  AVERAGE SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS  DECREASED  $632.2 MILLION  , OR  16.4%  , PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF DECREASES OF $427.6 MILLION IN SHORT-TERM FHLB ADVANCES AND $202.9 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED.  AVERAGE LONG-TERM BORROWINGS  INCREASED  $711.2 MILLION  , OR  113.3%  , PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM INCREASES OF $665.0 MILLION IN LONG-TERM FHLB ADVANCES AND $90.0 MILLION IN SUBORDINATED DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $45.0 MILLION IN JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT.  THE FUNDING OF BOTH FIXED AND ADJUSTABLE LONGER-TERM BORROWINGS WAS OPPORTUNISTICALLY TRANSACTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LOWER INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND ADD LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT LOAN GROWTH.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE ISSUED $120.0 MILLION OF 4.950% FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE IN 2029.  WE USED PART OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THIS ISSUANCE TO REDEEM HIGHER-RATE DEBT INCLUDING $44.0 MILLION IN JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBT AND $25.0 MILLION IN OTHER SUBORDINATED DEBT.  THE RATE PAID ON INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES INCREASED  34  BASIS POINTS TO  1.49%  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  , DUE TO CHANGES IN THE FUNDING MIX COMBINED WITH THE INTEREST RATE INCREASES MADE BY THE FOMC IN 2018.  PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS DETERMINED BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATES OF THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES NEEDED TO ABSORB PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO, AFTER GIVING CONSIDERATION TO CHARGE-OFFS AND RECOVERIES FOR THE PERIOD.

GENERATING GROWTH IN RELATIONSHIP-BASED TRANSACTION DEPOSITS REMAINS A KEY FOCUS FOR US AND WILL HELP US MANAGE TO LOWER LEVELS OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.  CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REGULATORY MATTERS  THE ACCESS TO, AND COST OF, FUNDING FOR NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES, THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN EXPANDED BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, THE ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND THE LEVEL AND NATURE OF REGULATORY OVERSIGHT DEPEND, IN PART, ON OUR CAPITAL POSITION.  THE ASSESSMENT OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS SUCH AS EXPECTED ORGANIC GROWTH IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, ASSET QUALITY, LIQUIDITY, EARNINGS PERFORMANCE, CHANGING COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS, REGULATORY CHANGES OR ACTIONS, AND ECONOMIC FORCES. WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A STRONG CAPITAL BASE TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH AND EXPANSION ACTIVITIES, TO PROVIDE STABILITY TO CURRENT OPERATIONS AND TO PROMOTE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE.  WE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SEC. PURSUANT TO THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT, WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, ISSUE AND SELL IN ONE OR MORE OFFERINGS ANY COMBINATION OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT SECURITIES, DEPOSITARY SHARES, WARRANTS, STOCK PURCHASE CONTRACTS OR UNITS.  ON FEBRUARY 14, 2019, WE COMPLETED OUR OFFERING OF $120.0 MILLION 4.950% FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE IN 2029 UNDER THIS REGISTRATION STATEMENT.  THE SUBORDINATED NOTES ARE TREATED AS TIER 2 CAPITAL FOR REGULATORY CAPITAL PURPOSES.  THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE DEBT OFFERING AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND COMMISSIONS AND OFFERING EXPENSES WERE $118.2 MILLION.  WE INTEND TO USE AND HAVE USED THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE SUBORDINATED NOTES TO REDEEM HIGHER-RATE LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  77  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS, WITH CAPITAL PLANS AND STRESS TESTING FOR FNB AND FNBPA UPDATED AT LEAST ANNUALLY. THESE CAPITAL PLANS INCLUDE ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF EXPECTED CAPITAL LEVELS ASSUMING VARIOUS SCENARIOS BY PROJECTING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR A FORECAST PERIOD OF 2-3 YEARS BEYOND THE CURRENT YEAR. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ISSUE SHARES INITIALLY ACQUIRED BY US AS TREASURY STOCK UNDER OUR VARIOUS BENEFIT PLANS.  WE MAY ISSUE ADDITIONAL PREFERRED OR COMMON STOCK IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR WELL-CAPITALIZED STATUS.  FNB AND FNBPA ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES (SEE DISCUSSION UNDER \u201cENHANCED REGULATORY CAPITAL STANDARDS\u201d). QUANTITATIVE MEASURES ESTABLISHED BY REGULATORS TO ENSURE CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIRE FNB AND FNBPA TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM AMOUNTS AND RATIOS OF TOTAL, TIER 1 AND COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL (AS DEFINED IN THE REGULATIONS) TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (AS DEFINED) AND MINIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO (AS DEFINED). FAILURE TO MEET MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS COULD LEAD TO INITIATION OF CERTAIN MANDATORY, AND POSSIBLY ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY ACTIONS, BY REGULATORS THAT, IF UNDERTAKEN, COULD HAVE A DIRECT MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, DIVIDENDS AND FUTURE BUSINESS AND CORPORATE STRATEGIES. UNDER CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES AND THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION, FNB AND FNBPA MUST MEET SPECIFIC CAPITAL GUIDELINES THAT INVOLVE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS AS CALCULATED UNDER REGULATORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. FNB\u2019S AND FNBPA\u2019S CAPITAL AMOUNTS AND CLASSIFICATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY THE REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THE MOST RECENT NOTIFICATION FROM THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES CATEGORIZED FNB AND FNBPA AS \u201cWELL-CAPITALIZED\u201d UNDER THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION. THERE ARE NO CONDITIONS OR EVENTS SINCE THE NOTIFICATION WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES HAVE CHANGED THIS CATEGORIZATION. OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT, AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , FNB AND FNBPA MET ALL \u201cWELL-CAPITALIZED\u201d REQUIREMENTS TO WHICH EACH OF THEM WAS SUBJECT.  78  FOLLOWING ARE THE CAPITAL AMOUNTS AND RELATED RATIOS FOR FNB AND FNBPA.

THE MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS PLUS CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, WHICH ARE PRESENTED FOR EACH PERIOD ABOVE BASED ON THE PHASE-IN SCHEDULE, REPRESENT THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS NEEDED TO AVOID LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTIONS OF DIVIDENDS AND CERTAIN DISCRETIONARY BONUS PAYMENTS.  DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2010 (DODD-FRANK ACT)  THE DODD-FRANK ACT BROADLY AFFECTS THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY BY ESTABLISHING A FRAMEWORK FOR SYSTEMIC RISK OVERSIGHT, CREATING A RESOLUTION AUTHORITY FOR INSTITUTIONS DETERMINED TO BE SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT, MANDATING HIGHER CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, REQUIRING BANKS TO PAY INCREASED FEES TO REGULATORY AGENCIES AND CONTAINING NUMEROUS OTHER PROVISIONS AIMED AT STRENGTHENING THE SOUND OPERATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR THAT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE SYSTEM OF REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, \u201cBUSINESS - GOVERNMENT SUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d INCLUDED IN OUR  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  AS FILED WITH THE SEC ON  FEBRUARY 26, 2019  . MANY ASPECTS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER RULEMAKING AND WILL TAKE EFFECT OVER SEVERAL YEARS, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE THE OVERALL FINANCIAL IMPACT TO US OR ACROSS THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.  79  LIQUIDITY  OUR GOAL IN LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS TO SATISFY THE CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS OF CUSTOMERS AND THE OPERATING CASH NEEDS OF FNB WITH COST-EFFECTIVE FUNDING.  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS ESTABLISHED AN ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POLICY TO GUIDE MANAGEMENT IN ACHIEVING AND MAINTAINING EARNINGS PERFORMANCE CONSISTENT WITH LONG-TERM GOALS, WHILE MAINTAINING ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF INTEREST RATE RISK, A \u201cWELL-CAPITALIZED\u201d BALANCE SHEET AND ADEQUATE LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY. OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS ALSO ESTABLISHED LIQUIDITY AND CONTINGENCY FUNDING POLICIES TO GUIDE MANAGEMENT IN ADDRESSING THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY MEASURE, MONITOR AND CONTROL BOTH NORMAL AND STRESSED LIQUIDITY CONDITIONS. THESE POLICIES DESIGNATE OUR ASSET/LIABILITY COMMITTEE AS THE BODY RESPONSIBLE FOR MEETING THESE OBJECTIVES. THE ALCO, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF MEMBERS OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, REVIEWS LIQUIDITY ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS AND APPROVES SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN STRATEGIES THAT AFFECT BALANCE SHEET OR CASH FLOW POSITIONS. LIQUIDITY IS CENTRALLY MANAGED DAILY BY OUR TREASURY DEPARTMENT.  FNBPA GENERATES LIQUIDITY FROM ITS NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. LIQUIDITY SOURCES FROM ASSETS INCLUDE PAYMENTS FROM LOANS AND INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO SECURITIZE, PLEDGE OR SELL LOANS, INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND OTHER ASSETS. LIQUIDITY SOURCES FROM LIABILITIES ARE GENERATED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE BANKING OFFICES OF FNBPA IN THE FORM OF DEPOSITS AND CUSTOMER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. FNB ALSO HAS ACCESS TO RELIABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE WHOLESALE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. SHORT- AND LONG-TERM FUNDS ARE USED TO HELP FUND NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AND UNUSED CREDIT AVAILABILITY CAN BE UTILIZED TO SERVE AS CONTINGENCY FUNDING IF WE WOULD BE FACED WITH A LIQUIDITY CRISIS.  THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF THE PARENT COMPANY\u2019S LIQUIDITY ARE ITS STRONG EXISTING CASH RESOURCES PLUS DIVIDENDS IT RECEIVES FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THESE DIVIDENDS MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE PARENT\u2019S OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 CAPITAL NEEDS, STATUTORY LAWS AND REGULATIONS, CORPORATE POLICIES, CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS, PROFITABILITY AND OTHER FACTORS. IN ADDITION, THROUGH ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, WE REGULARLY ISSUE SUBORDINATED NOTES, WHICH ARE GUARANTEED BY FNB. MANAGEMENT HAS UTILIZED VARIOUS STRATEGIES TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT CASH ON HAND IS AVAILABLE TO MEET THE PARENT'S FUNDING NEEDS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE COMPLETED A DEBT OFFERING IN WHICH WE ISSUED $120.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 4.950% FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE SUBORDINATED NOTES DUE IN 2029, WHICH IS TREATED AS TIER 2 CAPITAL FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES. SIXTY-NINE MILLION OF THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE DEBT OFFERING WAS USED TO REDEEM, RETIRE OR CALL EXISTING DEBT AND TPS AS NOTED BELOW. WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED $9.5 MILLION AND REDEEMED $15.5 MILLION IN HIGHER INTEREST RATE SUBORDINATED DEBT ASSUMED IN THE 2017 YDKN ACQUISITION. WE REDEEMED $10.0 MILLION OF TPS ISSUED BY AMERICAN COMMUNITY CAPITAL TRUST I ALSO ASSUMED IN THE 2017 YDKN ACQUISITION.  ADDITIONALLY, WE EXERCISED THE CALL OPTIONS ON $26.0 MILLION OF OMEGA FINANCIAL CAPITAL TRUST I AND $8.0 MILLION OF CRESCENT FINANCIAL CAPITAL TRUST I WITH APRIL SETTLEMENTS.  LASTLY, FROM THE NET DEBT ISSUANCE PROCEEDS, WE COMPLETED A CAPITAL INFUSION OF $40.0 MILLION TO FNBPA IN MARCH.  THESE TRANSACTIONS ACCOMPLISHED STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND WERE THE PRIMARY FACTORS RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN OUR LIQUIDITY METRICS AS SHOWN BELOW.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES OUR CASH LEVELS ARE APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. TWO METRICS THAT ARE USED TO GAUGE THE ADEQUACY OF THE PARENT COMPANY\u2019S CASH POSITION ARE THE LCR AND MCH. THE LCR IS DEFINED AS THE SUM OF CASH ON HAND PLUS PROJECTED CASH INFLOWS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS DIVIDED BY PROJECTED CASH OUTFLOWS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. THE MCH IS DEFINED AS THE NUMBER OF MONTHS OF CORPORATE EXPENSES AND DIVIDENDS THAT CAN BE COVERED BY THE CASH ON HAND.  80  THE LCR AND MCH RATIOS ARE PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.  TABLE 27  SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  DECEMBER 31, 2018  INTERNAL  LIMIT  LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO  2.2 TIMES  2.1 TIMES  > 1 TIME  MONTHS OF CASH ON HAND  15.1 MONTHS  14.4 MONTHS  > 12 MONTHS  OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION HAS BEEN POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE GROWTH IN RELATIONSHIP-BASED ACCOUNTS. ORGANIC GROWTH IN LOW-COST TRANSACTION DEPOSITS WAS COMPLEMENTED BY MANAGEMENT\u2019S STRATEGY OF HEIGHTENED DEPOSIT GATHERING EFFORTS FOCUSED ON ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND DEEPENING RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS, IN PART THROUGH INTERNAL LEAD GENERATION EFFORTS LEVERAGING DATA ANALYTICS CAPABILITIES.  TOTAL DEPOSITS WERE  $24.6 BILLION  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , AN INCREASE OF  $1.1 BILLION  , OR 6.5% ANNUALIZED, FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  TOTAL NON-INTEREST-BEARING DEMAND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS GREW BY  $291.6 MILLION  , OR 6.5% ANNUALIZED, AND INTEREST-BEARING DEMAND  INCREASED  BY  $993.9 MILLION  , OR 13.8% ANNUALIZED. SAVINGS ACCOUNT BALANCES  INCREASED  $0.2 MILLION  . TIME DEPOSITS DECLINED  $147.1 MILLION  , OR 3.7% ANNUALIZED.  FNBPA HAS SIGNIFICANT UNUSED WHOLESALE CREDIT AVAILABILITY SOURCES THAT INCLUDE THE AVAILABILITY TO BORROW FROM THE FHLB, THE FRB, CORRESPONDENT BANK LINES, ACCESS TO BROKERED DEPOSITS AND MULTIPLE OTHER CHANNELS. IN ADDITION TO CREDIT AVAILABILITY, FNBPA ALSO POSSESSES SALABLE UNPLEDGED GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES THAT COULD BE UTILIZED TO MEET FUNDING NEEDS. THE ALCO POLICY MINIMUM GUIDELINE LEVEL FOR SALABLE UNPLEDGED GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES IS 3.0%.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS CERTAIN INFORMATION RELATING TO FNBPA\u2019S CREDIT AVAILABILITY AND SALABLE UNPLEDGED SECURITIES.

THE FOLLOWING LIQUIDITY GAP ANALYSIS AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  COMPARES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR CASH FLOWS FROM EXISTING EARNING ASSETS AND INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES OVER FUTURE TIME INTERVALS. MANAGEMENT SEEKS TO LIMIT THE SIZE OF THE LIQUIDITY GAPS SO THAT SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS ARE REASONABLY MATCHED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. A REASONABLY MATCHED POSITION LAYS A BETTER FOUNDATION FOR DEALING WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING NEEDS DURING A POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY CRISIS. THE TWELVE-MONTH CUMULATIVE GAP TO TOTAL ASSETS RATIO IMPROVED TO  (0.5)%  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  FROM (7.1)% AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  MANAGEMENT CALCULATES THIS RATIO AT LEAST QUARTERLY AND IT IS REVIEWED MONTHLY BY ALCO.  81  TABLE 29  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)  WITHIN  1 MONTH  2-3  MONTHS  4-6  MONTHS  7-12  MONTHS  TOTAL  1 YEAR  ASSETS  LOANS  $593  $1,112  $1,377  $2,678  $5,760  INVESTMENTS  178  211  299  621  1,309  771  1,323  1,676  3,299  7,069  LIABILITIES  NON-MATURITY DEPOSITS  192  384  576  1,152  2,304  TIME DEPOSITS  426  785  742  1,277  3,230  BORROWINGS  1,432  15  28  239  1,714  2,050  1,184  1,346  2,668  7,248  PERIOD GAP (ASSETS - LIABILITIES)  $(1,279  )  $139  $330  $631  $(179  )  CUMULATIVE GAP  $(1,279  )  $(1,140  )  $(810  )  $(179  )  CUMULATIVE GAP TO TOTAL ASSETS  (3.7  )%  (3.3  )%  (2.4  )%  (0.5  )%  IN ADDITION, THE ALCO REGULARLY MONITORS VARIOUS LIQUIDITY RATIOS AND STRESS SCENARIOS OF OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES WE HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE TO MEET OUR NORMAL OPERATING AND CONTINGENCY FUNDING CASH NEEDS.  MARKET RISK  MARKET RISK REFERS TO POTENTIAL LOSSES ARISING PREDOMINATELY FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, EQUITY PRICES AND COMMODITY PRICES. WE ARE PRIMARILY EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK INHERENT IN OUR LENDING AND DEPOSIT-TAKING ACTIVITIES AS A FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY. TO SUCCEED IN THIS CAPACITY, WE OFFER AN EXTENSIVE VARIETY OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS TO MEET THE DIVERSE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE PRODUCTS SOMETIMES CONTRIBUTE TO INTEREST RATE RISK FOR US WHEN PRODUCT GROUPS DO NOT COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER. FOR EXAMPLE, DEPOSITORS MAY WANT SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS, WHILE BORROWERS MAY DESIRE LONG-TERM LOANS.  CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, CASH FLOWS AND NET INTEREST INCOME. SUBJECT TO ITS ONGOING OVERSIGHT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS GIVEN ALCO THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT, WHICH INVOLVES DEVISING POLICY GUIDELINES, RISK MEASURES AND LIMITS, AND MANAGING THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND ITS EFFECT ON NET INTEREST INCOME AND CAPITAL. WE USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES AND NOT FOR TRADING OR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.  INTEREST RATE RISK IS COMPRISED OF REPRICING RISK, BASIS RISK, YIELD CURVE RISK AND OPTIONS RISK. REPRICING RISK ARISES FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE CASH FLOW OR REPRICING BETWEEN ASSET AND LIABILITY PORTFOLIOS. BASIS RISK ARISES WHEN ASSET AND LIABILITY PORTFOLIOS ARE RELATED TO DIFFERENT MARKET RATE INDEXES, WHICH DO NOT ALWAYS CHANGE BY THE SAME AMOUNT. YIELD CURVE RISK ARISES WHEN ASSET AND LIABILITY PORTFOLIOS ARE RELATED TO DIFFERENT MATURITIES ON A GIVEN YIELD CURVE; WHEN THE YIELD CURVE CHANGES SHAPE, THE RISK POSITION IS ALTERED. OPTIONS RISK ARISES FROM \u201cEMBEDDED OPTIONS\u201d WITHIN ASSET AND LIABILITY PRODUCTS AS CERTAIN BORROWERS HAVE THE OPTION TO PREPAY THEIR LOANS, WHICH MAY BE WITH OR WITHOUT PENALTY, WHEN RATES FALL, WHILE CERTAIN DEPOSITORS CAN REDEEM THEIR CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT EARLY, WHICH MAY BE WITH OR WITHOUT PENALTY, WHEN RATES RISE.  WE USE AN ASSET/LIABILITY MODEL TO MEASURE OUR INTEREST RATE RISK. INTEREST RATE RISK MEASURES WE UTILIZE INCLUDE EARNINGS SIMULATION, EVE AND GAP ANALYSIS. GAP ANALYSIS AND EVE ARE STATIC MEASURES THAT DO NOT INCORPORATE ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FUTURE BUSINESS. GAP ANALYSIS, WHILE A HELPFUL DIAGNOSTIC TOOL, DISPLAYS CASH FLOWS FOR ONLY A SINGLE RATE ENVIRONMENT. EVE\u2019S LONG-TERM HORIZON HELPS IDENTIFY CHANGES IN OPTIONALITY AND LONGER-TERM POSITIONS. HOWEVER, EVE\u2019S LIQUIDATION PERSPECTIVE DOES NOT TRANSLATE INTO THE EARNINGS-BASED MEASURES THAT ARE THE FOCUS OF MANAGING AND VALUING A GOING CONCERN. NET INTEREST INCOME SIMULATIONS EXPLICITLY MEASURE THE EXPOSURE TO EARNINGS FROM CHANGES IN MARKET RATES OF INTEREST. IN THESE SIMULATIONS, OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL POSITION IS COMBINED WITH ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FUTURE BUSINESS TO CALCULATE NET INTEREST INCOME UNDER VARIOUS HYPOTHETICAL RATE SCENARIOS. THE ALCO REVIEWS EARNINGS SIMULATIONS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS UNDER VARIOUS INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS ON A PERIODIC BASIS. REVIEWING THESE VARIOUS MEASURES PROVIDES US WITH A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF OUR INTEREST RATE RISK PROFILE, WHICH PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES.  82  THE FOLLOWING REPRICING GAP ANALYSIS AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  COMPARES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS AND INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES SUBJECT TO REPRICING OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. MANAGEMENT UTILIZES THE REPRICING GAP ANALYSIS AS A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL IN MANAGING NET INTEREST INCOME AND EVE RISK MEASURES.

THE POSITIVE CUMULATIVE GAP POSITIONS INDICATE THAT WE HAVE A GREATER AMOUNT OF REPRICING EARNING ASSETS THAN REPRICING INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES OVER THE SUBSEQUENT TWELVE MONTHS. IF INTEREST RATES INCREASE AS MODELED, NET INTEREST INCOME WILL INCREASE AND, CONVERSELY, IF INTEREST RATES DECREASE AS MODELED, NET INTEREST INCOME WILL DECREASE. THE CHANGE IN THE CUMULATIVE REPRICING GAP AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  COMPARED TO  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO GROWTH AND CHANGES IN THE MIX OF LOANS, DEPOSITS AND BORROWINGS AS FOLLOWS. STRONG COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOAN GROWTH, A PORTION OF WHICH WAS SWAPPED TO ADJUSTABLE RATES, THE SALE OF LONG-TERM FIXED RATE MORTGAGE LOANS, AND THE INCREASED CASH FLOW FROM THE LOAN AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS, WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN AND REPRICING OF CERTAIN INTEREST-BEARING NON-MATURITY DEPOSIT BALANCES AND THE FUNDING OF LONG-TERM FHLB ADVANCES. THE FUNDING OF BOTH FIXED AND ADJUSTABLE LONGER-TERM BORROWINGS WAS OPPORTUNISTICALLY TRANSACTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LOWER INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND ADD LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT LOAN GROWTH.  THE ALLOCATION OF NON-MATURITY DEPOSITS AND CUSTOMER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS TO THE ONE-MONTH MATURITY CATEGORY ABOVE IS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED SENSITIVITY OF EACH PRODUCT TO CHANGES IN MARKET RATES. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A PRODUCT\u2019S RATE IS ESTIMATED TO INCREASE BY 50% AS MUCH AS THE MARKET RATES, THEN 50% OF THE ACCOUNT BALANCE WAS PLACED IN THIS CATEGORY.  UTILIZING NET INTEREST INCOME SIMULATIONS, THE FOLLOWING NET INTEREST INCOME METRICS WERE CALCULATED USING RATE SHOCKS WHICH MOVE MARKET RATES IN AN IMMEDIATE AND PARALLEL FASHION. THE VARIANCE PERCENTAGES REPRESENT THE CHANGE BETWEEN THE NET INTEREST INCOME AND EVE CALCULATED UNDER THE PARTICULAR RATE SCENARIO VERSUS THE NET INTEREST INCOME AND EVE THAT WAS CALCULATED ASSUMING MARKET RATES AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  .  USING A STATIC BALANCE SHEET STRUCTURE, THE MEASURES DO NOT REFLECT ALL OF MANAGEMENT'S POTENTIAL COUNTERACTIONS.  83  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL SENSITIVITY OF OUR NET INTEREST INCOME AND EVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES USING RATE SHOCKS.  TABLE 31  SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  DECEMBER 31, 2018  ALCO  LIMITS  NET INTEREST INCOME CHANGE (12 MONTHS).  + 300 BASIS POINTS  7.3%  3.5%  N/A  + 200 BASIS POINTS  5.2  2.5  (5.0  )%  + 100 BASIS POINTS  2.8  1.4  (5.0  )  - 100 BASIS POINTS  (4.2  )  (3.1  )  (5.0  )  ECONOMIC VALUE OF EQUITY.  + 300 BASIS POINTS  (1.1  )  (8.0  )  (25.0  )  + 200 BASIS POINTS  (0.2  )  (5.2  )  (15.0  )  + 100 BASIS POINTS  0.7  (2.0  )  (10.0  )  - 100 BASIS POINTS  (4.1  )  (1.0  )  (10.0  )  WE ALSO MODEL RATE SCENARIOS WHICH MOVE ALL RATES GRADUALLY OVER TWELVE MONTHS (RATE RAMPS) AND MODEL SCENARIOS THAT GRADUALLY CHANGE THE SHAPE OF THE YIELD CURVE.  ASSUMING A STATIC BALANCE SHEET, A +100 BASIS POINT RATE RAMP INCREASES NET INTEREST INCOME (12 MONTHS) BY 1.7% AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND 1.0% AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE CORRESPONDING METRICS FOR A -100 BASIS POINT RATE RAMP ARE (2.2)% AND (1.6)% AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  OUR STRATEGY IS GENERALLY TO MANAGE TO A NEUTRAL INTEREST RATE RISK POSITION.  CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR QUARTERS, WE DESIRED TO REMAIN SLIGHTLY ASSET-SENSITIVE DURING THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF  2019.  THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE OUR INTEREST RATE RISK POSITION AND IMPACT NET INTEREST INCOME.  THESE INCLUDE EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS THE SHAPE OF THE YIELD CURVE AND EXPECTATIONS REGARDING FUTURE INTEREST RATES, AS WELL AS INTERNAL FACTORS REGARDING PRODUCT OFFERINGS, PRODUCT MIX AND PRICING OF LOANS AND DEPOSITS.  AT YEAR-END 2018, THE MARKET CONSENSUS WAS EXPECTING THE FOMC TO INCREASE INTEREST RATES DUE TO A STRENGTHENING ECONOMY.  HOWEVER, CITING A SOFTENING ECONOMY, THE FOMC ACTUALLY MOVED TO LOWER RATES TWICE DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019.  MANAGEMENT UTILIZES VARIOUS TACTICS TO ACHIEVE OUR DESIRED INTEREST RATE RISK (IRR) POSITION.  IN RESPONSE TO THE CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES, MANAGEMENT WAS PROACTIVE IN ADDRESSING OUR IRR POSITION.  AS MENTIONED EARLIER, WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN GROWING OUR TRANSACTION DEPOSITS WHICH PROVIDES FUNDING THAT IS LESS INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE THAN SHORT-TERM TIME DEPOSITS AND WHOLESALE BORROWINGS.  ALSO, WE WERE ABLE TO LOWER RATES ON CERTAIN DEPOSIT PRODUCTS AND SHORTEN THE TERM OF THE CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT VOLUMES. THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN INTENSE FOCUS OF MANAGEMENT.  FURTHER, DURING THE QUARTER, MANAGEMENT TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE SHAPE OF THE YIELD CURVE TO TERM OUT BORROWINGS AT RATES BELOW OUR OVERNIGHT BORROWING RATE.  ON THE LENDING SIDE, WE REGULARLY SELL LONG-TERM FIXED-RATE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES TO THE SECONDARY MARKET AND HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE ORIGINATION OF CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL LOANS WITH SHORT-TERM REPRICING CHARACTERISTICS.  IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE MADE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO COMMERCIAL BORROWERS (COMMERCIAL SWAPS) TO MANAGE OUR IRR POSITION AS THE COMMERCIAL SWAPS EFFECTIVELY INCREASE ADJUSTABLE-RATE LOANS.  TOTAL VARIABLE AND ADJUSTABLE-RATE LOANS WERE  58.8%  AND  57.4%  OF TOTAL LOANS AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, WITH  79.0%  OF THESE LOANS, OR  46.5%  OF TOTAL LOANS, TIED TO THE PRIME OR ONE-MONTH LIBOR RATES.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THE COMMERCIAL SWAPS TOTALED $3.4 BILLION  OF NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL, WITH  $903.1 MILLION  IN NOTIONAL SWAP PRINCIPAL ORIGINATED DURING THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF  2019  .  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS, SEE NOTE 9 IN THIS REPORT.  THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS ALSO USED, IN PART, TO MANAGE OUR IRR POSITION.  THESE PURCHASES ARE FIXED RATE IN NATURE IN WHICH WE SEEK TO MINIMIZE PREPAYMENT RISK.  WE RECOGNIZE THAT ALL ASSET/LIABILITY MODELS HAVE SOME INHERENT SHORTCOMINGS.  ASSET/LIABILITY MODELS REQUIRE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS TO BE MADE, SUCH AS PREPAYMENT RATES ON INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS AND REPRICING IMPACT ON NON-MATURITY DEPOSITS, WHICH MAY DIFFER FROM ACTUAL EXPERIENCE.  THESE BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR EXPERIENCE, BUSINESS PLANS, ECONOMIC AND MARKET TRENDS AND AVAILABLE INDUSTRY DATA.  WHILE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ITS METHODOLOGY FOR DEVELOPING SUCH ASSUMPTIONS IS REASONABLE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT MODELED RESULTS WILL BE ACHIEVED.  FURTHERMORE, THE METRICS ARE BASED UPON THE BALANCE SHEET STRUCTURE AS OF THE VALUATION DATE AND DO NOT REFLECT THE PLANNED GROWTH OR MANAGEMENT ACTIONS THAT COULD BE TAKEN.  84  RISK MANAGEMENT  AS A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, WE TAKE ON A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RISK IN EVERY BUSINESS DECISION, TRANSACTION AND ACTIVITY. OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAVE IDENTIFIED SEVEN MAJOR CATEGORIES OF RISK: CREDIT RISK, MARKET RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK, REPUTATIONAL RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISK AND STRATEGIC RISK. IN ITS OVERSIGHT ROLE OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOCUSES ON THE STRATEGIES, ANALYSES AND CONCLUSIONS OF MANAGEMENT RELATING TO IDENTIFYING, UNDERSTANDING AND MANAGING RISKS SO AS TO OPTIMIZE TOTAL STOCKHOLDER VALUE, WHILE BALANCING PRUDENT BUSINESS AND SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS CONSIDERATIONS.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADOPTED A RISK APPETITE STATEMENT THAT DEFINES ACCEPTABLE RISK LEVELS AND LIMITS UNDER WHICH WE SEEK TO OPERATE IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE RETURNS.  AS SUCH, THE BOARD MONITORS A SERIES OF KRIS, OR KEY RISK INDICATORS, FOR VARIOUS BUSINESS LINES, OPERATIONAL UNITS, AND RISK CATEGORIES, PROVIDING INSIGHT INTO HOW OUR PERFORMANCE ALIGNS WITH OUR STATED RISK APPETITE.  THESE RESULTS ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT TO ENSURE ADHERENCE TO OUR RISK APPETITE STATEMENT, AND WHERE APPROPRIATE, ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE TO APPLICABLE BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND TACTICS WHERE RISKS ARE APPROACHING STATED TOLERANCES OR FOR EMERGING RISKS.  WE SUPPORT OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS THROUGH A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE INVOLVING OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE JOINT RISK COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE FNBPA BOARD OF DIRECTORS HELPS ENSURE THAT BUSINESS DECISIONS ARE EXECUTED WITHIN APPROPRIATE RISK TOLERANCES. THE RISK COMMITTEE HAS OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  IDENTIFICATION, MEASUREMENT, ASSESSMENT AND MONITORING OF ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK;  \u2022  DEVELOPMENT OF APPROPRIATE AND MEANINGFUL RISK METRICS TO USE IN CONNECTION WITH THE OVERSIGHT OF OUR BUSINESSES AND STRATEGIES;  \u2022  REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES TO MANAGE OUR CREDIT, MARKET, LIQUIDITY, LEGAL, REGULATORY AND OPERATING RISK (INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONAL, COMPLIANCE AND FIDUCIARY RISKS); AND  \u2022  IDENTIFICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RISK MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES.  THE RISK COMMITTEE SERVES AS THE PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT BETWEEN OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE RISK MANAGEMENT COUNCIL, WHICH IS THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT LEVEL COMMITTEE RESPONSIBLE FOR RISK MANAGEMENT. RISK APPETITE IS AN INTEGRAL ELEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS AND CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESSES THROUGH OUR BOARD RISK COMMITTEE AND RISK MANAGEMENT COUNCIL.  WE USE OUR RISK APPETITE PROCESSES TO PROMOTE APPROPRIATE ALIGNMENT OF RISK, CAPITAL AND PERFORMANCE TACTICS, WHILE ALSO CONSIDERING RISK CAPACITY AND APPETITE CONSTRAINTS FROM BOTH FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL RISKS.  OUR TOP-DOWN RISK APPETITE PROCESS SERVES AS A LIMIT FOR UNDUE RISK-TAKING FOR BOTTOM-UP PLANNING FROM OUR VARIOUS BUSINESS FUNCTIONS.  OUR BOARD RISK COMMITTEE, IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR RISK MANAGEMENT COUNCIL, APPROVES OUR RISK APPETITE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY, AS NEEDED TO REFLECT CHANGES IN THE RISK, REGULATORY, ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC PLAN ENVIRONMENTS, WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT OUR RISK APPETITE REMAINS CONSISTENT WITH OUR STRATEGIC PLANS AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS, REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS' EXPECTATIONS.  REPORTS RELATING TO OUR RISK APPETITE AND STRATEGIC PLANS, AND OUR ONGOING MONITORING THEREOF, ARE REGULARLY PRESENTED TO OUR VARIOUS MANAGEMENT LEVEL RISK OVERSIGHT AND PLANNING COMMITTEES AND PERIODICALLY REPORTED UP THROUGH OUR BOARD RISK COMMITTEE.  AS NOTED ABOVE, WE HAVE A RISK MANAGEMENT COUNCIL COMPRISED OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO PROVIDE REGULAR OVERSIGHT OF SPECIFIC AREAS OF RISK WITH RESPECT TO THE LEVEL OF RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE. MANAGEMENT HAS ALSO ESTABLISHED AN OPERATIONAL RISK COMMITTEE THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IDENTIFYING, EVALUATING AND MONITORING OPERATIONAL RISKS ACROSS FNB, EVALUATING AND APPROVING APPROPRIATE REMEDIATION EFFORTS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED OPERATIONAL RISKS AND PROVIDING PERIODIC REPORTS CONCERNING OPERATIONAL RISKS TO THE RISK MANAGEMENT COUNCIL. THE RISK MANAGEMENT COUNCIL REPORTS ON A REGULAR BASIS TO THE RISK COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK PROFILE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUES. OUR CHIEF RISK OFFICER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY AND FRAMEWORK THROUGH THE MULTIPLE SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE AREAS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING DEPARTMENTS:  ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT, FRAUD RISK, LOAN REVIEW, MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT, THIRD-PARTY RISK MANAGEMENT, ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND BANK SECRECY ACT, COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT, APPRAISAL REVIEW, COMPLIANCE AND INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY. ALL SECOND LINE OF DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS REPORT TO THE CHIEF RISK OFFICER TO ENSURE THE COORDINATED AND CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION OF RISK MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES AND STRATEGIES ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS. OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT CONDUCTS RISK AND CONTROL ASSESSMENTS ACROSS ALL OF OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL AREAS TO ENSURE THE APPROPRIATE RISK IDENTIFICATION, RISK MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING OF RISKS ENTERPRISE-WIDE.  THE FRAUD RISK DEPARTMENT MONITORS FOR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FRAUD RISK ACROSS ALL OF OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL UNITS.  THE LOAN REVIEW DEPARTMENT CONDUCTS INDEPENDENT TESTING OF OUR LOAN RISK RATINGS TO ENSURE THEIR ACCURACY, WHICH IS INSTRUMENTAL TO CALCULATING OUR  85  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.  OUR MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT OVERSEES VALIDATION AND TESTING OF ALL MODELS USED IN MANAGING RISK ACROSS OUR COMPANY.  OUR THIRD-PARTY RISK MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT ENSURES EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT OF THIRD-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS THROUGHOUT THE VENDOR LIFE CYCLE.  THE ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND BANK SECRECY ACT DEPARTMENT MONITORS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH MONEY LAUNDERING RISK AND ASSOCIATED REGULATORY COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS.  OUR COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT DEPARTMENT MONITORS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT.  THE APPRAISAL REVIEW DEPARTMENT FACILITATES INDEPENDENT ORDERING AND REVIEW OF REAL ESTATE APPRAISALS OBTAINED FOR DETERMINING THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL FOR LOANS TO CUSTOMERS.  OUR COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS WHICH GOVERN OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. OUR INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING A RISK ASSESSMENT OF OUR INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY RISKS AND ENSURING APPROPRIATE CONTROLS ARE IN PLACE TO MANAGE AND CONTROL SUCH RISKS, THROUGH THE USE OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY FRAMEWORK FOR IMPROVING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE BY MEASURING AND EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY CONTROLS. FURTHER, OUR AUDIT FUNCTION PERFORMS AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS ENVIRONMENT AND PLAYS AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN TESTING THE OPERATION OF THE INTERNAL CONTROLS SYSTEMS AND REPORTING FINDINGS TO MANAGEMENT AND OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE.  EACH OF THE RISK, AUDIT AND CREDIT RISK AND CRA COMMITTEES OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGULARLY REPORT ON RISK-RELATED MATTERS TO THE FULL BOARD OF DIRECTORS. IN ADDITION, BOTH THE RISK COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND OUR RISK MANAGEMENT COUNCIL REGULARLY ASSESS OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK PROFILE AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON ACTIONS NEEDED TO ADDRESS KEY AND EMERGING RISK ISSUES.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS BELIEVES THAT OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS IS EFFECTIVE AND ENABLES THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO.  \u2022  ASSESS THE QUALITY OF THE INFORMATION WE RECEIVE;  \u2022  UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESSES, INVESTMENTS AND FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, LEGAL, REGULATORY AND STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS AND THE RISKS THAT WE FACE;  \u2022  OVERSEE AND ASSESS HOW SENIOR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES RISK; AND  \u2022  ASSESS APPROPRIATELY THE QUALITY OF OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS.  86  RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS TO GAAP  RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP OPERATING MEASURES AND KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS DISCUSSED IN THIS REPORT TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THIS COMMENTARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW AND ENVIRONMENT  TESSCO ARCHITECTS AND DELIVERS INNOVATIVE PRODUCT AND VALUE CHAIN SOLUTIONS TO SUPPORT WIRELESS BROADBAND SYSTEMS. ALTHOUGH WE SELL PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS IN MANY COUNTRIES, APPROXIMATELY 97% OF OUR SALES ARE MADE TO CUSTOMERS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE OPERATIONS AND OFFICE FACILITIES IN HUNT VALLEY, MARYLAND, RENO, NEVADA AND SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS.  THE COMPANY EVALUATES ITS BUSINESS WITHIN TWO SEGMENTS: COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL. THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING CUSTOMER MARKETS:  (1) PUBLIC CARRIERS, THAT ARE GENERALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING AND MAINTAINING THE INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM AND PROVIDE AIRTIME SERVICE TO INDIVIDUAL SUBSCRIBERS; AND (2) VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INTEGRATORS, WHICH RESULTS FROM THE CONSOLIDATION OF OUR PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS, GOVERNMENT CHANNELS AND PRIVATE SYSTEM OPERATOR MARKETS, AND REFLECTS IMPLEMENTATION OVER THE 2019 FISCAL YEAR OF AN ENHANCED GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY. THIS GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY AND THE CORRESPONDING CONSOLIDATION OF THESE CUSTOMER MARKETS IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE SALES OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE CONSOLIDATED MARKETS, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE BETTER COVERAGE TO CUSTOMERS AND TO BETTER ALIGN TERRITORIES WITH SUPPLIER PARTNERS. THE RETAIL SEGMENT CONSISTS OF THE RETAIL MARKET WHICH INCLUDES RETAILERS, INDEPENDENT DEALER AGENTS AND CARRIERS.  WE OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED INTO FOUR PRODUCT CATEGORIES: BASE STATION INFRASTRUCTURE; NETWORK SYSTEMS; INSTALLATION, TEST AND MAINTENANCE; AND MOBILE DEVICE ACCESSORIES. BASE STATION INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCTS ARE USED TO BUILD, REPAIR AND UPGRADE WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. SALES OF TRADITIONAL BASE STATION INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS BASE STATION RADIOS, CABLE AND TRANSMISSION LINES AND ANTENNAS ARE IN PART DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL SPENDING IN THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. NETWORK SYSTEMS PRODUCTS ARE USED TO BUILD AND UPGRADE COMPUTING AND INTERNET NETWORKS. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN GROWING OUR OFFERING OF WIRELESS BROADBAND, DISTRIBUTED ANTENNAS SYSTEMS (DAS), NETWORK EQUIPMENT, SECURITY AND SURVEILLANCE PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE NOT AS DEPENDENT ON THE OVERALL CAPITAL SPENDING OF THE INDUSTRY. INSTALLATION, TEST AND MAINTENANCE PRODUCTS ARE USED TO INSTALL, TUNE, AND MAINTAIN WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. THIS CATEGORY IS MADE UP OF SOPHISTICATED ANALYSIS EQUIPMENT AND VARIOUS FREQUENCY, VOLTAGE AND POWER-MEASURING DEVICES, REPLACEMENT PARTS AND COMPONENTS AS WELL AS AN ASSORTMENT OF TOOLS, HARDWARE AND SUPPLIES REQUIRED BY SERVICE TECHNICIANS.  MOBILE DEVICE ACCESSORIES PRODUCTS INCLUDE CELLULAR PHONE AND DATA DEVICE ACCESSORIES.  OUR ONGOING ABILITY TO EARN REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS LOOKING TO US FOR PRODUCT AND SUPPLY CHAIN SOLUTIONS DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THE TERMS, AND ACCORDINGLY THE FACTORS, APPLICABLE TO EACH RELATIONSHIP OFTEN DIFFER. AMONG THESE FACTORS ARE THE STRENGTH OF THE CUSTOMER\u2019S OR SUPPLIER\u2019S BUSINESS, THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE, INCLUDING PRICE STABILITY, CHANGING CUSTOMER OR SUPPLIER REQUIREMENTS, AND OUR ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE CUSTOMER OR SUPPLIER AND TO CONTINUALLY DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CAN IMPROVE THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THE AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS ON WHICH OUR CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS ARE BASED ARE TYPICALLY OF LIMITED DURATION, TYPICALLY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OBLIGATION IN RESPECT OF ANY SPECIFIC PRODUCT PURCHASE OR SALE AND ARE TERMINABLE BY EITHER PARTY UPON SEVERAL MONTHS OR OTHERWISE RELATIVELY SHORT NOTICE. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE PAST BY THE LOSS AND CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS HABITS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS, AND EXPECT THAT WE WILL AGAIN BE SO AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE. OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS COULD  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ALSO BE AFFECTED BY WIRELESS CARRIER CONSOLIDATION OR THE OVERALL GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.  THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY IS COMPETITIVE AND FRAGMENTED AND IS COMPRISED OF SEVERAL NATIONAL DISTRIBUTORS. IN ADDITION, MANY MANUFACTURERS SELL DIRECT. BARRIERS TO ENTRY FOR DISTRIBUTORS ARE RELATIVELY LOW, PARTICULARLY IN THE MOBILE DEVICES AND ACCESSORIES MARKET, AND THE RISK OF NEW COMPETITORS ENTERING THE MARKETPLACE IS HIGH. CONSOLIDATION OF LARGER WIRELESS CARRIERS HAS AND WILL MOST LIKELY CONTINUE TO IMPACT OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMER BASE. OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND CHALLENGES. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT OUR STRENGTH IN SERVICE, THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF OUR PRODUCT OFFERING, OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM, INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE, AND OUR LARGE CUSTOMER BASE AND PURCHASING RELATIONSHIPS WITH APPROXIMATELY 400 MANUFACTURERS, PROVIDE US WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OVER NEW ENTRANTS TO THE MARKETPLACE.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020 COMPARED WITH SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019  TOTAL REVENUES.  REVENUES FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED 10.6% COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. REVENUES IN OUR PUBLIC CARRIER MARKET, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INTEGRATORS MARKET AND RETAIL MARKET DECREASED BY 1.3%, 6.1% AND 24.1%, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECLINE IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN REVENUE IN OUR VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INTEGRATORS MARKET WHERE WE ARE NOT YET REALIZING THE FULL BENEFITS OF OUR SALES REORGANIZATION. THE DECLINE IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT WAS DRIVEN BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REVENUES FROM ONE OF OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT RETAIL CUSTOMERS FOLLOWING ITS ACQUISITION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, CHANGE IN BUSINESS MODEL AND SUBSEQUENT TRANSITION OF ITS BUSINESS ELSEWHERE, AS WELL AS ONGOING OVERALL MARKET SOFTNESS.  TOTAL GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED BY 16.2% COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES VOLUME COMBINED WITH THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS. OVERALL GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED FROM 19.8% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO 18.6% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. WITHIN OUR COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN IN OUR PUBLIC CARRIER MARKET INCREASED FROM 12.0% TO 12.4% DUE TO CHANGES IN CUSTOMER MIX. GROSS PROFIT MARGIN IN OUR VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INTEGRATORS MARKET DECREASED FROM 24.6% TO 23.8%. THIS DECLINE WAS DUE TO A CHANGE IN PRODUCT MIX, INCLUDING LOWER SALES OF OUR HIGHER MARGIN VENTEV PRODUCTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. WITHIN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED FROM 19.3% TO 16.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS.  AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER THE HEADING \u201cBUSINESS OVERVIEW AND ENVIRONMENT,\u201d OUR ONGOING ABILITY TO EARN REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS WHICH OFTEN DIFFER FOR EACH RELATIONSHIP. AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS ON WHICH THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE BASED TYPICALLY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OBLIGATION IN RESPECT OF ANY SPECIFIC PRODUCT PURCHASE OR SALE, ARE OF LIMITED DURATION, AND ARE TERMINABLE BY EITHER PARTY UPON RELATIVELY SHORT NOTICE. WE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE PAST BY THE LOSS AND CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS HABITS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS, AND EXPECT THAT WE WILL AGAIN BE SO AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE.  SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES.  TOTAL SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED BY $3.7 MILLION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES DECREASED FROM 18.6% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, TO 18.2% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE DECREASE IN OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF $1.5 IN FREIGHT EXPENSE, $1.0 MILLION IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE, $0.7 MILLION IN REWARDS EXPENSE, AND $0.6 MILLION IN MARKETING EXPENSE, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THESE DECREASES WERE LARGELY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN OVERALL REVENUES.  WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR EXISTING CUSTOMER RECEIVABLE PORTFOLIO AND PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE RESERVE BASED ON THIS EVALUATION. WE ALSO EVALUATE THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF PROSPECTIVE AND CURRENT CUSTOMERS AND MAKE DECISIONS REGARDING EXTENSION OF CREDIT TERMS TO SUCH CUSTOMERS BASED ON THIS EVALUATION. WE HAD BAD DEBT RECOVERY, NET OF EXPENSE, OF $107,900 AND BAD DEBT EXPENSE OF $665,100 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  INTEREST, NET.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED FROM $244,800 FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO $335,100 FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. INCREASED FOCUS ON BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR SALES TO OUR PUBLIC CARRIER CUSTOMERS HAS REQUIRED US TO MAINTAIN INCREASED INVENTORY LEVELS, AND AT TIMES HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED BORROWINGS AND INTEREST EXPENSE UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q). WE EXPECT THIS HIGHER LEVEL OF INTEREST EXPENSE TO CONTINUE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS.  INCOME TAXES, NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED FROM 28.8% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO 90.8% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS THE RESULT OF PERMANENT AND OTHER TAX ADJUSTMENTS REMAINING CONSISTENT YEAR OVER YEAR WHILE PRE-TAX INCOME DECREASED YEAR OVER YEAR. THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN RATES IS ALSO DUE TO A CHANGE IN ESTIMATED FISCAL YEAR PRE-TAX EARNINGS FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, RESULTING IN A SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENT IN THIS QUARTER\u2019S RATE. NET INCOME DECREASED 98.2% AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE DECREASED 100% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER.  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR 2020 COMPARED WITH FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR 2019  TOTAL REVENUES.  REVENUES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 DECREASED 12.0% COMPARED WITH THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. REVENUES IN OUR PUBLIC CARRIER MARKET, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INTEGRATORS MARKET AND RETAIL MARKET DECREASED BY 9.2%, 3.4% AND 26.3%, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECLINE IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PROJECT-ORIENTED NATURE OF THIS BUSINESS. SEVERAL LARGE CUSTOMERS ADJUSTED THEIR FORECASTS OR PUSHED OUT THEIR PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS FROM THE FIRST SIX MONTHS INTO THE REMAINDER OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE DECLINE IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT WAS DRIVEN BY SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REVENUES FROM ONE OF OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT RETAIL CUSTOMERS FOLLOWING ITS ACQUISITION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, CHANGE IN BUSINESS MODEL AND SUBSEQUENT TRANSITION OF ITS BUSINESS ELSEWHERE, AS WELL AS ONGOING OVERALL MARKET SOFTNESS.  TOTAL GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED BY 16.9% COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES VOLUME COMBINED WITH THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS. OVERALL GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED FROM 20.1% IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 TO 18.9% IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. WITHIN OUR COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN IN OUR PUBLIC CARRIER MARKET AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INTEGRATORS MARKET DECREASED SLIGHTLY FROM 13.0% TO 12.5%, AND 24.5% TO 24.1%, RESPECTIVELY DUE TO CHANGES IN CUSTOMER MIX. WITHIN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED FROM 19.8% TO 15.9% IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS AND INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS.  AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER THE HEADING \u201cBUSINESS OVERVIEW AND ENVIRONMENT,\u201d OUR ONGOING ABILITY TO EARN REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS WHICH OFTEN DIFFER FOR EACH RELATIONSHIP. AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS ON WHICH THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE BASED TYPICALLY DO NOT  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INCLUDE ANY OBLIGATION IN RESPECT OF ANY SPECIFIC PRODUCT PURCHASE OR SALE, ARE OF LIMITED DURATION, AND ARE TERMINABLE BY EITHER PARTY UPON RELATIVELY SHORT NOTICE. WE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE PAST BY THE LOSS AND CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS HABITS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS, AND EXPECT THAT WE WILL AGAIN BE SO AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE.  SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES.  TOTAL SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED BY $4.6 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES INCREASED FROM 18.9% FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, TO 19.8% FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020.  THE DECREASE IN OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF $1.5 MILLION IN FREIGHT EXPENSE, $1.5 MILLION IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND $1.4 MILLION IN REWARDS EXPENSE, DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THESE DECREASES WERE LARGELY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN OVERALL REVENUES.  THE COMPANY ALSO INCURRED A $0.5 MILLION RESTRUCTURING CHARGE RELATED TO SEVERANCE EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR EXISTING CUSTOMER RECEIVABLE PORTFOLIO AND PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE RESERVE BASED ON THIS EVALUATION. WE ALSO EVALUATE THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF PROSPECTIVE AND CURRENT CUSTOMERS AND MAKE DECISIONS REGARDING EXTENSION OF CREDIT TERMS TO SUCH CUSTOMERS BASED ON THIS EVALUATION. WE INCURRED BAD DEBT EXPENSE, NET OF RECOVERY,  OF $27,500 AND $1,021,300 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  INTEREST, NET.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED FROM $419,200 FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 TO $543,800 FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. INCREASED FOCUS ON BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR SALES TO OUR PUBLIC CARRIER CUSTOMERS HAS REQUIRED US TO MAINTAIN INCREASED INVENTORY LEVELS, AND AT TIMES HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED BORROWINGS AND INTEREST EXPENSE UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q). WE EXPECT THIS HIGHER LEVEL OF INTEREST EXPENSE TO CONTINUE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS.  INCOME TAXES, NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED FROM 27.4% FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 TO 24.9% FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. NET INCOME DECREASED 205.2% AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE DECREASED 207.4% FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OR USED IN OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  SIX MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 29, 2019  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  CASH FLOW USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(14,033,500)  $(3,250,900)  CASH FLOW USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (3,333,600)  (2,315,800)  CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  17,445,000  5,547,300  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $77,900  $(19,400)  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE USED $14.0 MILLION OF NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED WITH NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $3.3 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THIS FISCAL 2020 OUTFLOW WAS DRIVEN BY A NET LOSS AND AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY. BOTH CURRENT AND POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN OUR PUBLIC CARRIER BUSINESS CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN INVENTORY.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $3.3 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 INCREASED FROM CASH USED OF $2.3 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. CASH USED IN BOTH PERIODS WAS DUE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES LARGELY COMPRISED OF INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $17.4 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $5.5 MILLION PROVIDED IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. WE UTILIZED OUR ASSET BASED SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND 2019, LEADING TO A CASH INFLOW OF $20.9 MILLION AND $8.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THOSE PERIODS. WE HAD CASH OUTFLOWS OF $3.4 MILLION DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF BOTH FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019, DUE TO CASH DIVIDENDS PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS.  ON OCTOBER 19, 2017, THE COMPANY AND ITS PRIMARY OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, AS CO-BORROWERS, ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH SUNTRUST BANK, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS A LENDER (THE \u201cAMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d), WHICH AMENDED AND RESTATED THE TERMS OF A PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND WHICH RESULTED IN, AMONG OTHER MODIFICATIONS, AN INCREASE IN THE COMPANY\u2019S BORROWING LIMIT TO UP TO $75 MILLION, FROM THE PREVIOUS BORROWING LIMIT OF UP TO $35 MILLION.  IN ADDITION TO INCREASING THE BORROWING LIMIT, AND AMONG OTHER MODIFICATIONS, THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT EXTENDED THE APPLICABLE MATURITY DATE TO OCTOBER 19, 2021. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, BORROWINGS UNDER THE SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TOTALED $35.3 MILLION; THEREFORE, WE THEN HAD $39.7 MILLION AVAILABLE, SUBJECT TO THE BORROWING BASE LIMITATIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE OTHER APPLICABLE TERMS OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. BORROWINGS UNDER THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT ACCRUE INTEREST AT THE RATES, AND THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO PAY A MONTHLY COMMITMENT FEE, AS ALSO DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ENTERING INTO OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER COMPANY AFFILIATE BORROWERS UNDER THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES, REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY AS THE LOAN PARTIES, EXECUTED AND DELIVERED TO SUNTRUST BANK, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, A REAFFIRMATION AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE LOAN PARTIES UNDER THE GUARANTY AND SECURITY AGREEMENT PREVIOUSLY DELIVERED BY THE LOAN PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AS PREVIOUSLY EXISTING (INCLUDING THE PREVIOUSLY EXISTING GUARANTY BY THE LOAN PARTIES NOT OTHERWISE BORROWERS AND THE PREVIOUSLY EXISTING GRANT BY THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER LOAN PARTIES OF A CONTINUING FIRST PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN INVENTORY, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS, AND ON ALL DOCUMENTS, INSTRUMENTS, GENERAL INTANGIBLES, LETTER OF CREDIT RIGHTS, AND ALL PROCEEDS) WERE RATIFIED AND CONFIRMED AS RESPECTS THE OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM TIME TO TIME UNDER THE SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDED FOR PURSUANT TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT.  WE HAVE MADE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010. OUR MOST RECENT QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.20 PER SHARE WAS PAID IN AUGUST 2019. ON OCTOBER 29, 2019, OUR BOARD DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND IN THE AMOUNT OF $0.20 PER SHARE, PAYABLE ON NOVEMBER 27, 2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF NOVEMBER 13, 2019.  ANY FUTURE DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANY CORRESPONDING RECORD AND PAYMENT DATES REMAINS SUBJECT TO FURTHER DETERMINATION FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH, PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. TO MINIMIZE INTEREST EXPENSE, OUR POLICY IS TO APPLY EXCESS AVAILABLE CASH TO REDUCE THE BALANCE OUTSTANDING FROM TIME TO TIME ON OUR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  OUR INCREASED FOCUS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL QUARTERS ON BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR SALES TO OUR PUBLIC CARRIER CUSTOMERS LED TO THE RECENT EXPANSION OF OUR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AND HAS AT TIMES RESULTED IN INCREASED BORROWINGS AND DEPENDENCE ON THAT FACILITY. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE, ALTHOUGH AT PRESENT WE HAVE NO PLANS FOR ANY FURTHER EXPANSION OF THE FACILITY.  IF WE WERE TO UNDERTAKE AN ACQUISITION OR OTHER MAJOR CAPITAL PURCHASES THAT REQUIRE FUNDS IN EXCESS OF EXISTING SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, WE WOULD LOOK TO SOURCES OF FUNDING FROM ADDITIONAL CREDIT FACILITIES, DEBT AND/OR EQUITY ISSUANCES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURE COMMITMENTS.  IN ADDITION, OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DECREASING REVENUES AND PROFITS RESULTING FROM A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR A REDUCTION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY OUR CUSTOMERS, OR BY THE WEAKENED FINANCIAL CONDITIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS, IN EACH CASE AS A RESULT OF A DOWNTURN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A GLOBAL PATIENT-DEDICATED BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY ENGAGED IN THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT, AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF A DIVERSE SET OF NOVEL TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS LIVING WITH RARE DISEASES. WE HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES LED BY OUR NOVEL MEDICINE FOR FABRY DISEASE THAT HAS ACHIEVED WIDESPREAD GLOBAL APPROVAL, A DIFFERENTIATED BIOLOGIC FOR POMPE DISEASE IN THE CLINIC, AND AN INDUSTRY LEADING RARE DISEASE GENE THERAPY PORTFOLIO.  THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR PORTFOLIO IS GALAFOLD  \u00ae  (ALSO REFERRED TO AS \"MIGALASTAT\"), THE FIRST AND ONLY APPROVED ORAL PRECISION MEDICINE FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH FABRY DISEASE WHO HAVE AMENABLE GENETIC VARIANTS. MIGALASTAT IS CURRENTLY APPROVED UNDER THE TRADE NAME GALAFOLD  \u00ae  IN THE UNITED STATES (\"U.S.\"), EUROPEAN UNION (\"E.U.\"), AND JAPAN, WITH ADDITIONAL APPROVALS GRANTED AND APPLICATIONS PENDING IN SEVERAL GEOGRAPHIES.  THE LEAD BIOLOGICS PROGRAM OF OUR PIPELINE IS AMICUS THERAPEUTICS GAA (\"AT-GAA\", ALSO KNOWN AS ATB200/AT2221), A NOVEL, CLINICAL-STAGE, POTENTIAL BEST-IN-CLASS TREATMENT PARADIGM FOR POMPE DISEASE. IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\"FDA\") GRANTED BREAKTHROUGH THERAPY DESIGNATION TO AT-GAA FOR THE TREATMENT OF LATE ONSET POMPE DISEASE.  WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN INDUSTRY LEADING GENE THERAPY PORTFOLIO OF POTENTIAL THERAPIES FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH RARE METABOLIC DISEASES, THROUGH A LICENSE WITH NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (\"NCH\") AND AN EXPANDED COLLABORATION WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA (\"PENN\"). OUR PIPELINE INCLUDES GENE THERAPY PROGRAMS IN RARE, NEUROLOGIC LYSOSOMAL DISORDERS (\"LDS\"), SPECIFICALLY: CLN6, CLN3, AND CLN8 BATTEN DISEASE, POMPE DISEASE, FABRY DISEASE, CDKL5 DEFICIENCY DISORDER (\"CDD\"), NIEMANN-PICK TYPE C (\u201cNPC\u201d), MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIB (\"MPSIIIB\"), AS WELL AS A NEXT GENERATION PROGRAM IN MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDOSIS TYPE IIIA (\"MPSIIIA\"). THIS EXPANDED COLLABORATION WITH PENN ALSO PROVIDES US WITH EXCLUSIVE DISEASE-SPECIFIC ACCESS AND THE OPTION RIGHTS TO DEVELOP POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE NEW GENE THERAPY PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES AND PROGRAMS FOR MOST LDS AND A BROADER PORTFOLIO OF RARE DISEASES, INCLUDING RETT SYNDROME, ANGELMAN SYNDROME, MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY, AND SELECT OTHER MUSCULAR DYSTROPHIES.  OUR STRATEGY  OUR STRATEGY IS TO CREATE, MANUFACTURE, TEST, AND DELIVER THE HIGHEST QUALITY MEDICINES FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH RARE METABOLIC DISEASES THROUGH INTERNALLY DEVELOPED, ACQUIRED, OR IN-LICENSED PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO OBSOLETE CURRENT TREATMENTS, PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS TO PATIENTS, AND BE FIRST- OR BEST-IN-CLASS. IN ADDITION TO OUR PROGRAMS IN FABRY AND POMPE, WE HAVE BEGUN TO LEVERAGE OUR GLOBAL CAPABILITIES TO DEVELOP AND EXPAND OUR ROBUST PIPELINE THROUGH OUR RECENT ENTRY INTO GENOMIC MEDICINE. WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARD FULFILLING OUR VISION TO BUILD A LEADING GLOBAL BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY FOCUSED ON RARE METABOLIC DISEASES.  HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR PROGRESS IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF  2019  INCLUDE.  \u2022  COMMERCIAL AND REGULATORY SUCCESS IN FABRY DISEASE  . DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , GALAFOLD  \u00ae  REVENUE TOTALED  $126.9 MILLION  ,  AN  INCREASE  OF  $68.3 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. WE CONTINUE TO SEE STRONG MOMENTUM THROUGHOUT ALL OF OUR MARKETS AND CONTINUE TO EXPAND INTO ADDITIONAL GEOGRAPHIES. IN THE COUNTRIES WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING THE LONGEST, SUCH AS GERMANY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, WE SEE AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF PREVIOUSLY UNTREATED PATIENTS COME ONTO GALAFOLD  \u00ae  . IN THE U.S., WE CONTINUE TO SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PATIENTS FROM A GROWING AND VERY WIDE PRESCRIBER BASE. ACROSS ALL MARKETS, WE SEE A HIGH RATE OF COMPLIANCE AND ADHERENCE TO THIS ORAL TREATMENT OPTION.  \u2022  POMPE CLINICAL PROGRAM MILESTONES  . WE REPORTED POSITIVE DATA FROM A PHASE 1/2 CLINICAL STUDY TO EVALUATE POMPE DISEASE PATIENTS TREATED WITH OUR NOVEL TREATMENT PARADIGM AT-GAA. THE U.S. FDA ALSO GRANTED BREAKTHROUGH THERAPY DESIGNATION FOR AT-GAA FOR THE TREATMENT OF LATE-ONSET POMPE DISEASE. WE ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLING A GLOBAL PIVOTAL STUDY OF AT-GAA (ATB200-03, ALSO KNOWN AS PROPEL) WHICH IS ON TRACK TO ENROLL APPROXIMATELY 100 PARTICIPANTS WITH LATE-ONSET POMPE DISEASE AT UP TO 90 GLOBAL SITES.  \u2022  PIPELINE GROWTH.  WITH OUR RECENT GENE THERAPY PROGRAM EXPANSION, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN INDUSTRY LEADING GENE THERAPY PORTFOLIO OF MEDICINES FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH RARE METABOLIC DISEASES. THROUGH OUR LICENSE WITH NCH, WE ACQUIRED WORLDWIDE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIAL RIGHTS FOR TEN GENE THERAPY PROGRAMS IN RARE, NEUROLOGIC LDS WITH PROGRAMS IN CLN6, CLN3, AND CLN8 BATTEN DISEASE. ADDITIONALLY, FOUR PROGRAMS WERE ADDED TO THE PIPELINE THROUGH ONGOING COLLABORATIONS  WITH PENN TO PURSUE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL GENE THERAPIES FOR POMPE DISEASE, FABRY DISEASE, CDD, NPC, MPSIIIB, AS WELL AS A NEXT GENERATION PROGRAM IN MPSIIIA.  24  \u2022  MANUFACTURING  . WE SUCCESSFULLY SCALED UP MANUFACTURING OF OUR POMPE BIOLOGIC TO COMMERCIAL SCALE (1,000L) FOR OUR PIVOTAL PROPEL STUDY AND COMMERCIAL SUPPLY. OUR SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH WUXI BIOLOGICS AND CURRENT CAPACITY ARE EXPECTED TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES TO SUPPORT COMMERCIAL NEEDS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AFTER RECEIPT OF APPLICABLE REGULATORY APPROVALS. FOR GENE THERAPY, WE HAVE RECENTLY ENTERED INTO STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WITH TWO BEST-IN-CLASS CONTRACT DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATIONS: CATALENT BIOLOGICS AND THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC. CATALENT BIOLOGICS WILL SUPPORT OUR CLINICAL MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES AND CAPACITY FOR MULTIPLE ACTIVE PRECLINICAL LYSOSOMAL DISORDER PROGRAMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT IN COLLABORATION WITH PENN. THERMO FISHER WILL ASSIST WITH LATE-STAGE CLINICAL AND COMMERCIAL-SCALE CAPABILITIES AND PROVIDES US WITH IMMEDIATE CLINICAL AND COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES AND CAPACITY FOR THE AMICUS INTRATHECAL AAV BATTEN DISEASE GENE THERAPY PROGRAMS.  \u2022  FINANCIAL STRENGTH.  TOTAL CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF  $514.2 MILLION  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  COMPARED TO  $504.2 MILLION  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THE CURRENT CASH POSITION, INCLUDING EXPECTED GALAFOLD  \u00ae  REVENUES, IS SUFFICIENT TO FUND ONGOING FABRY, POMPE, AND GENE THERAPY PROGRAM OPERATIONS  INTO THE FIRST HALF OF 2022  . POTENTIAL FUTURE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATIONS, PIPELINE EXPANSION, AND INVESTMENT IN MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES COULD IMPACT OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  OUR COMMERCIAL PRODUCT AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES  GALAFOLD  \u00ae  (MIGALASTAT HCL) FOR FABRY DISEASE  OUR ORAL PRECISION MEDICINE GALAFOLD  \u00ae  WAS GRANTED ACCELERATED APPROVAL BY THE FDA IN AUGUST 2018 UNDER THE BRAND NAME GALAFOLD  \u00ae  FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADULTS WITH A CONFIRMED DIAGNOSIS OF FABRY DISEASE AND AN AMENABLE GALACTOSIDASE ALPHA GENE (\"GLA\") VARIANT BASED ON IN VITRO ASSAY DATA. THE FDA APPROVED GALAFOLD  \u00ae  FOR 348 AMENABLE GLA VARIANTS. GALAFOLD  \u00ae  WAS APPROVED IN THE E.U. IN MAY 2016 AS A FIRST-LINE THERAPY FOR LONG-TERM TREATMENT OF ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS, AGED 16 YEARS AND OLDER, WITH A CONFIRMED DIAGNOSIS OF FABRY DISEASE AND WHO HAVE AN AMENABLE VARIANT. THE APPROVED E.U. LABEL INCLUDES 367 FABRY-CAUSING VARIANTS, WHICH REPRESENT UP TO HALF OF ALL PATIENTS WITH FABRY DISEASE. APPROVALS HAVE ALSO BEEN GRANTED IN JAPAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, WITH ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS PENDING. WE HAVE BEEN GRANTED PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT IN 27 COUNTRIES. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO LAUNCH GALAFOLD  \u00ae  IN ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES DURING  2019.  AS AN ORALLY ADMINISTERED MONOTHERAPY, GALAFOLD  \u00ae  IS DESIGNED TO BIND TO AND STABILIZE AN ENDOGENOUS ALPHA-GALACTOSIDASE A (\"ALPHA-GAL A\") ENZYME IN THOSE PATIENTS WITH GENETIC VARIANTS IDENTIFIED AS AMENABLE IN A GLP CELL-BASED AMENABILITY ASSAY. GALAFOLD  \u00ae  IS AN ORAL PRECISION MEDICINE INTENDED TO TREAT FABRY DISEASE IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE AMENABLE GENETIC VARIANTS AND, AT THIS TIME, IT IS NOT INTENDED FOR CONCOMITANT USE WITH ERT.  GENE THERAPY FOR FABRY DISEASE  WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUED INNOVATION FOR ALL PEOPLE LIVING WITH FABRY DISEASE. FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH FABRY DISEASE WHO HAVE NON-AMENABLE VARIANTS, WHICH ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR GALAFOLD  \u00ae  AS A MONOTHERAPY, OUR STRATEGY IS TO DEVELOP A FABRY GENE THERAPY. IN OCTOBER 2018, WE FURTHER EXPANDED OUR GENE THERAPY PORTFOLIO THROUGH A COLLABORATION AGREEMENT WITH PENN TO PURSUE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL GENE THERAPIES FOR FABRY DISEASE.  NOVEL ERT FOR POMPE DISEASE  WE ARE LEVERAGING OUR BIOLOGICS CAPABILITIES TO DEVELOP AT-GAA, A NOVEL TREATMENT PARADIGM FOR POMPE DISEASE. AT-GAA CONSISTS OF A UNIQUELY ENGINEERED RHGAA ENZYME, ATB200, WITH AN OPTIMIZED CARBOHYDRATE STRUCTURE TO ENHANCE LYSOSOMAL UPTAKE, ADMINISTERED IN COMBINATION WITH A PHARMACOLOGICAL CHAPERONE, AT2221, TO IMPROVE ACTIVITY AND STABILITY. WE INITIATED A GLOBAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL STUDY (\"ATB200-03\", OR \"PROPEL\") OF AT-GAA IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH LATE ONSET POMPE DISEASE IN 2018, WITH THE FIRST PATIENT DOSED IN DECEMBER 2018.  THE PHARMACOLOGICAL CHAPERONE, AT2221 IS NOT AN ACTIVE INGREDIENT THAT CONTRIBUTES DIRECTLY TO GAA SUBSTRATE REDUCTION BUT INSTEAD ACTS TO STABILIZE ATB200. THE SMALL MOLECULE PHARMACOLOGICAL CHAPERONE AT2221 BINDS AND STABILIZES ATB200 TO IMPROVE THE UPTAKE OF ACTIVE ENZYME IN KEY DISEASE-RELEVANT TISSUES, RESULTING IN INCREASED CLEARANCE OF ACCUMULATED SUBSTRATE, GLYCOGEN.  OUR STRATEGY IS TO ENHANCE THE BODY OF CLINICAL DATA FOR AT-GAA IN ONGOING CLINICAL STUDIES. THE PROPEL PIVOTAL STUDY DELIVERS THIS POTENTIAL NEW THERAPY TO AS MANY PEOPLE LIVING WITH LATE ONSET POMPE DISEASE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. BASED ON REGULATORY FEEDBACK FROM BOTH THE U.S. FDA AND THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY (\"EMA\"), THE PROPEL STUDY IS EXPECTED TO SUPPORT APPROVAL FOR A BROAD INDICATION, INCLUDING ERT-SWITCH AND TREATMENT-NAI\u0308VE PATIENTS, IF THE RESULTS ARE FAVORABLE.  25  IN OCTOBER 2019, WE REPORTED ADDITIONAL INTERIM DATA FROM OUR CLINICAL STUDY ATB200-02 AT THE 24TH INTERNATIONAL ANNUAL CONGRESS OF THE WORLD MUSCLE SOCIETY. HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDED MUSCLE FUNCTION, SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY DATA IN PATIENTS AS WELL AS PHARMACODYNAMIC DATA (MUSCLE DAMAGE BIOMARKER, CREATINE KINASE, AND DISEASE SUBSTRATE BIOMARKER, URINE HEXOSE TETRASACCHARIDE). MUSCLE FUNCTION IMPROVED IN 16 OUT OF 18 PATIENTS AT 24 MONTHS. MEAN SIX-MINUTE WALK TEST (\"6MWT\") IMPROVED IN BOTH ERT-NAI\u0308VE AND ERT-SWITCH PATIENTS WITH CONTINUED BENEFIT OBSERVED OUT TO MONTH 24. ALL 5 ERT-NAIVE PATIENTS SHOWED INCREASES FROM BASELINE IN 6MWT DISTANCE AT ALL TIME POINTS OUT TO MONTH 24. TO DATE, ADVERSE EVENTS HAVE BEEN GENERALLY MILD AND TRANSIENT. AT-GAA HAS RESULTED IN A LOW RATE OF INFUSION-ASSOCIATED REACTIONS (\"IARS\") FOLLOWING OVER 1,500+ INFUSIONS (28 EVENTS OF IARS IN EIGHT PATIENTS). THE CLINICAL PHARMACOKINETIC PROFILE HAS BEEN CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PRECLINICAL DATA. TREATMENT WITH AT-GAA RESULTED IN PERSISTENT AND DURABLE REDUCTIONS IN CREATINE KINASE AND URINE HEXOSE TETRASACCHARIDE ACROSS ALL PATIENT COHORTS UP TO MONTH 24.  GENE THERAPY FOR POMPE DISEASE  AS PART OF OUR LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT UNMET NEEDS OF THE POMPE COMMUNITY, WE ARE ALSO ADVANCING A NEXT-GENERATION GENE THERAPY TREATMENT FOR POMPE DISEASE. IN OCTOBER 2018, WE FURTHER EXPANDED OUR GENE THERAPY PORTFOLIO THROUGH A COLLABORATION AGREEMENT WITH PENN TO PURSUE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL GENE THERAPIES FOR, AMONG OTHER INDICATIONS, POMPE DISEASE.  IN APRIL 2019, WE PRESENTED INITIAL PRECLINICAL DATA FROM OUR INVESTIGATIONAL ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRAL (\"AAV\") GENE THERAPY PROGRAM FOR POMPE DISEASE. THIS INITIAL PRECLINICAL STUDY IN POMPE KNOCKOUT MICE ADMINISTERED A SINGLE HIGH DOSE OF AAV GENE THERAPY WITH EITHER UNMODIFIED WILD-TYPE HGAA (\"UNMODIFIED HGAA\") OR AN AMICUS/PENN ENGINEERED HGAA TRANSGENE WITH A LYSOSOMAL-TARGETING CELL RECEPTOR BINDING MOTIF (\"ENGINEERED HGAA\"). THE AMICUS/PENN ENGINEERED HGAA AAV GENE THERAPY DEMONSTRATED MORE UNIFORM CELLULAR UPTAKE AND LYSOSOMAL TARGETING COMPARED TO UNMODIFIED HGAA AAV GENE THERAPY, AS WELL AS, ROBUST GLYCOGEN REDUCTION IN ALL KEY TISSUES IN POMPE DISEASE THAT WERE ASSESSED. IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, THE ENGINEERED HGAA AAV GENE THERAPY SHOWED ROBUST GLYCOGEN REDUCTION IN NEURONAL CELLS, SUGGESTING THIS MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO ADDRESS NEURONAL ASPECTS OF POMPE DISEASE. UNMODIFIED HGAA AAV GENE THERAPY SHOWED MINIMAL GLYCOGEN REDUCTION IN NEURONAL CELLS. THIS PRECLINICAL STUDY PROVIDES INITIAL VALIDATION FOR COMBINING AMICUS-ENGINEERED TRANSGENES WITH PENN'S AAV GENE THERAPY TECHNOLOGIES.  BATTEN DISEASE PRODUCT CANDIDATES  WE ARE RESEARCHING POTENTIAL FIRST-IN-CLASS GENE THERAPIES FOR MULTIPLE FORMS OF BATTEN DISEASE. BATTEN DISEASE IS THE COMMON NAME FOR A BROAD CLASS OF RARE, FATAL, INHERITED DISORDERS OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM ALSO KNOWN AS NEURONAL CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSES, OR NCLS. IN THESE DISEASES, A DEFECT IN A SPECIFIC GENE TRIGGERS A CASCADE OF PROBLEMS THAT INTERFERES WITH A CELL'S ABILITY TO RECYCLE CERTAIN MOLECULES. EACH GENE IS CALLED CLN (CEROID LIPOFUSCINOSIS, NEURONAL) AND GIVEN A DIFFERENT NUMBER DESIGNATION AS ITS SUBTYPE. THERE ARE 13 KNOWN FORMS OF BATTEN DISEASE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS CLN1-8; 10-14. THE VARIOUS TYPES OF BATTEN DISEASE HAVE SIMILAR FEATURES AND SYMPTOMS BUT VARY IN SEVERITY AND AGE OF ONSET.  THE TWO CLINICAL STAGE GENE THERAPIES ARE IN CLN3 AND CLN6 BATTEN DISEASE. THE CLN6 BATTEN DISEASE PHASE 1/2 STUDY COMPLETED TARGET ENROLLMENT, WITH TWELVE PATIENTS RECEIVING A SINGLE ADMINISTRATION OF ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRUS SEROTYPE 9 AAV-CLN6 GENE THERAPY. IN AUGUST 2019, WE REPORTED POSITIVE INTERIM CLINICAL DATA FROM THE FIRST EIGHT PATIENTS IN THE STUDY. THE AAV-CLN6 GENE THERAPY DEMONSTRATED A POSITIVE IMPACT ON MOTOR AND LANGUAGE FUNCTION. SEVEN OUT OF EIGHT PATIENTS MAINTAINED STABLE HAMBURG MOTOR AND LANGUAGE SCORES OR HAD AN INITIAL CHANGE (+1 TO -1 POINTS) FOLLOWED BY STABILIZATION. IN OCTOBER 2019, WE REPORTED ADDITIONAL INTERIM CLINICAL DATA FURTHER SUPPORTING THE IMPACT OF ONE-TIME INTRATHECAL AAV GENE THERAPY IN CHILDREN WITH CLN6 BATTEN DISEASE.  THIS INTERIM DATA SUGGESTED STABILIZATION OF VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE HAMBURG MOTOR, LANGUAGE, SEIZURE AND VISION SCORES IN MOST PATIENTS FROM BASELINE TO MONTH 12 OR 24, IN PARTICULAR THOSE PATIENTS TREATED AT A YOUNGER AGE.  IN THE CLN3 BATTEN DISEASE STUDY, A TOTAL OF THREE PATIENTS WERE DOSED IN THE LOW DOSE GROUP WITH NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AFTER UP TO 5 MONTHS FOLLOWING A SINGLE ADMINISTRATION OF AAV-CLN3 GENE THERAPY.

UGA\u2019S  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS  FACTORS.  UGA HAS BASED THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO IT ON THE DATE OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q,  AND UGA ASSUMES NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH UGA UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION TO REVISE OR  UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE, INVESTORS ARE ADVISED  TO CONSULT ANY ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES THAT UGA MAY MAKE DIRECTLY TO THEM OR THROUGH REPORTS THAT UGA FILES IN THE FUTURE WITH THE  U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \u201cSEC\u201d), INCLUDING ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM  10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K.  INTRODUCTION  UGA, A DELAWARE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, IS  A COMMODITY POOL THAT ISSUES SHARES THAT MAY BE PURCHASED AND SOLD ON THE NYSE ARCA, INC. (THE \u201cNYSE ARCA\u201d). THE INVESTMENT  OBJECTIVE OF UGA IS FOR THE DAILY CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS OF ITS SHARES\u2019 PER SHARE NET ASSET VALUE (\u201cNAV\u201d)  TO REFLECT THE DAILY CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS OF THE SPOT PRICE OF GASOLINE (ALSO KNOWN AS REFORMULATED GASOLINE BLENDSTOCK  FOR OXYGEN BLENDING, OR \u201cRBOB\u201d, FOR DELIVERY TO THE NEW YORK HARBOR), AS MEASURED BY THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE PRICE  OF THE FUTURES CONTRACT FOR GASOLINE TRADED ON THE NEW YORK MERCANTILE EXCHANGE (THE \u201cNYMEX\u201d) THAT IS THE NEAR MONTH  CONTRACT TO EXPIRE, EXCEPT WHEN THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT IS WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF EXPIRATION, IN WHICH CASE IT WILL BE THE FUTURES  CONTRACT THAT IS THE NEXT MONTH CONTRACT TO EXPIRE (THE \u201cBENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT\u201d), PLUS INTEREST EARNED ON UGA\u2019S  COLLATERAL HOLDINGS, LESS UGA\u2019S EXPENSES. \u201cNEAR MONTH CONTRACT\u201d MEANS THE NEXT CONTRACT TRADED ON THE NYMEX DUE  TO EXPIRE. \u201cNEXT MONTH CONTRACT\u201d MEANS THE FIRST CONTRACT TRADED ON THE NYMEX DUE TO EXPIRE AFTER THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT.  UGA\u2019S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE IS  NOT  FOR ITS NAV OR MARKET PRICE OF SHARES TO EQUAL, IN DOLLAR TERMS, THE SPOT PRICE OF GASOLINE OR ANY PARTICULAR FUTURES CONTRACT  BASED ON GASOLINE,  NOR  IS UGA\u2019S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE FOR THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN ITS NAV TO REFLECT THE PERCENTAGE  CHANGE OF THE PRICE OF ANY PARTICULAR FUTURES CONTRACT AS MEASURED OVER A TIME PERIOD  GREATER THAN ONE DAY  . THE GENERAL  PARTNER OF UGA, UNITED STATES COMMODITY FUNDS LLC (\u201cUSCF\u201d), BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT PRACTICAL TO MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO  TO ACHIEVE SUCH AN INVESTMENT GOAL WHEN INVESTING IN FUTURES CONTRACTS (AS DEFINED BELOW) AND OTHER GASOLINE-RELATED INVESTMENTS  (AS DEFINED BELOW).  15  UGA INVESTS PRIMARILY IN FUTURES CONTRACTS  FOR GASOLINE, CRUDE OIL, NATURAL GAS, HEATING OIL AND OTHER PETROLEUM-BASED FUELS THAT ARE TRADED ON THE NYMEX, ICE FUTURES OR  OTHER U.S. AND FOREIGN EXCHANGES (COLLECTIVELY, \u201cFUTURES CONTRACTS\u201d) AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH  REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OR IN VIEW OF MARKET CONDITIONS, OTHER GASOLINE-RELATED INVESTMENTS SUCH AS CASH-SETTLED OPTIONS ON FUTURES  CONTRACTS, FORWARD CONTRACTS FOR GASOLINE, CLEARED SWAP CONTRACTS AND OVER-THE-COUNTER (\u201cOTC\u201d) SWAPS THAT ARE BASED  ON THE PRICE OF GASOLINE, CRUDE OIL AND OTHER PETROLEUM-BASED FUELS, FUTURES CONTRACTS AND INDICES BASED ON THE FOREGOING (COLLECTIVELY,  \u201cOTHER GASOLINE-RELATED INVESTMENTS\u201d). FOR CONVENIENCE AND UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED, FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OTHER  GASOLINE-RELATED INVESTMENTS COLLECTIVELY ARE REFERRED TO AS \u201cGASOLINE INTERESTS\u201d IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM  10-Q.  USCF BELIEVES THAT MARKET ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITIES  WILL CAUSE DAILY CHANGES IN UGA\u2019S SHARE PRICE ON THE NYSE ARCA ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS TO CLOSELY TRACK DAILY CHANGES IN UGA\u2019S  PER SHARE NAV ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS. USCF FURTHER BELIEVES THAT DAILY CHANGES IN PRICES OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT HAVE  HISTORICALLY CLOSELY TRACKED THE DAILY CHANGES IN SPOT PRICES OF GASOLINE. USCF BELIEVES THAT THE NET EFFECT OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS  WILL BE THAT THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF UGA\u2019S SHARES ON THE NYSE ARCA ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS WILL CLOSELY TRACK, THE  DAILY CHANGES IN THE SPOT PRICE OF GASOLINE ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS, PLUS INTEREST EARNED ON UGA\u2019S COLLATERAL HOLDINGS, LESS  UGA\u2019S EXPENSES.  UGA SEEKS TO ACHIEVE ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE  BY INVESTING SO THAT THE AVERAGE DAILY PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN UGA\u2019S NAV FOR ANY PERIOD OF 30 SUCCESSIVE VALUATION DAYS WILL  BE WITHIN PLUS/MINUS TEN PERCENT (10%) OF THE AVERAGE DAILY PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT OVER  THE SAME PERIOD.  REGULATORY DISCLOSURE  ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS, POSITION LIMITS  AND PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS  . DESIGNATED CONTRACT MARKETS (\u201cDCMS\u201d), SUCH AS THE NYMEX AND ICE FUTURES, HAVE ESTABLISHED  ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS AND POSITION LIMITS ON THE MAXIMUM NET LONG OR NET SHORT FUTURES CONTRACTS IN COMMODITY INTERESTS THAT ANY  PERSON OR GROUP OF PERSONS UNDER COMMON TRADING CONTROL (OTHER THAN AS A HEDGE, WHICH AN INVESTMENT BY UGA IS NOT) MAY HOLD, OWN  OR CONTROL. THESE LEVELS AND POSITION LIMITS APPLY TO THE FUTURES CONTRACTS THAT UGA INVESTS IN TO MEET ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE.  IN ADDITION TO ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS AND POSITION LIMITS, THE NYMEX AND ICE FUTURES ALSO SET DAILY PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS ON  FUTURES CONTRACTS. THE DAILY PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMIT ESTABLISHES THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT THE PRICE OF A FUTURES CONTRACT MAY VARY  EITHER UP OR DOWN FROM THE PREVIOUS DAY\u2019S SETTLEMENT PRICE. ONCE THE DAILY PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMIT HAS BEEN REACHED IN A  PARTICULAR FUTURES CONTRACT, NO TRADES MAY BE MADE AT A PRICE BEYOND THAT LIMIT.  THE ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS FOR THE BENCHMARK  FUTURES CONTRACT AND OTHER FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ON U.S.-BASED FUTURES EXCHANGES, SUCH AS THE NYMEX, ARE NOT A FIXED CEILING,  BUT RATHER A THRESHOLD ABOVE WHICH THE NYMEX MAY EXERCISE GREATER SCRUTINY AND CONTROL OVER AN INVESTOR\u2019S POSITIONS. THE  CURRENT ACCOUNTABILITY LEVEL FOR INVESTMENTS FOR ANY ONE MONTH IN THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT IS 5,000 CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION,  THE NYMEX IMPOSES AN ACCOUNTABILITY LEVEL FOR ALL MONTHS OF 7,000 NET FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR INVESTMENTS IN FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR  GASOLINE. IN ADDITION, THE ICE FUTURES MAINTAINS ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS, POSITION LIMITS AND MONITORING AUTHORITY FOR ITS UNLEADED  GASOLINE FUTURES CONTRACTS. IF UGA AND THE RELATED PUBLIC FUNDS (AS DEFINED BELOW) EXCEED THESE ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS FOR INVESTMENTS  IN THE FUTURES CONTRACT FOR GASOLINE, THE NYMEX AND ICE FUTURES WILL MONITOR UGA\u2019S AND THE RELATED PUBLIC FUNDS\u2019 EXPOSURE  AND MAY ASK FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THEIR ACTIVITIES INCLUDING THE TOTAL SIZE OF ALL POSITIONS, INVESTMENT AND TRADING STRATEGY,  AND THE EXTENT OF LIQUIDITY RESOURCES OF UGA AND THE RELATED PUBLIC FUNDS. IF DEEMED NECESSARY BY THE NYMEX AND/OR ICE FUTURES,  UGA COULD BE ORDERED TO REDUCE ITS AGGREGATE NET POSITION BACK TO THE ACCOUNTABILITY LEVEL. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, UGA HELD  465 FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR GASOLINE TRADED ON THE NYMEX. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, UGA DID NOT HOLD ANY FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED  ON ICE FUTURES. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, UGA DID NOT EXCEED ANY ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS ON THE NYMEX OR ICE  FUTURES.  16  POSITION LIMITS DIFFER FROM ACCOUNTABILITY  LEVELS IN THAT THEY REPRESENT FIXED LIMITS ON THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF FUTURES CONTRACTS THAT ANY PERSON MAY HOLD AND CANNOT ALLOW  SUCH LIMITS TO BE EXCEEDED WITHOUT EXPRESS CFTC AUTHORITY TO DO SO. IN ADDITION TO ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS AND POSITION LIMITS THAT  MAY APPLY AT ANY TIME, THE NYMEX AND ICE FUTURES IMPOSE POSITION LIMITS ON CONTRACTS HELD IN THE LAST FEW DAYS OF TRADING IN THE  NEAR MONTH CONTRACT TO EXPIRE. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT UGA WILL RUN UP AGAINST SUCH POSITION LIMITS BECAUSE UGA\u2019S INVESTMENT  STRATEGY IS TO CLOSE OUT ITS POSITIONS AND \u201cROLL\u201d FROM THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT TO EXPIRE TO THE NEXT MONTH CONTRACT  BEGINNING TWO WEEKS FROM EXPIRATION OF THE CONTRACT. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, UGA DID NOT EXCEED ANY POSITION  LIMITS IMPOSED BY THE NYMEX AND ICE FUTURES.  THE REGULATION OF COMMODITY INTEREST TRADING  IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES IS AN EVOLVING AREA OF THE LAW. THE VARIOUS STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS SUMMARY ARE SUBJECT  TO MODIFICATION BY LEGISLATIVE ACTION AND CHANGES IN THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SEC, FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY  (\u201cFINRA\u201d), CFTC, NFA, THE FUTURES EXCHANGES, CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER REGULATORY BODIES.  FUTURES CONTRACTS AND POSITION LIMITS  THE CFTC IS GENERALLY PROHIBITED BY STATUTE  FROM REGULATING TRADING ON NON-U.S. FUTURES EXCHANGES AND MARKETS. THE CFTC, HOWEVER, HAS ADOPTED REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE MARKETING  OF NON-U.S. FUTURES CONTRACTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE REGULATIONS PERMIT CERTAIN CONTRACTS ON NON-U.S. EXCHANGES TO BE OFFERED  AND SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE CFTC HAS PROPOSED TO ADOPT LIMITS ON  SPECULATIVE POSITIONS IN 25 PHYSICAL COMMODITY FUTURES AND OPTION CONTRACTS AS WELL AS SWAPS THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY EQUIVALENT TO  SUCH CONTRACTS IN THE AGRICULTURE, ENERGY AND METALS MARKETS (THE \u201cPOSITION LIMIT RULES\u201d). THE POSITION LIMIT RULES  WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS: IDENTIFY WHICH CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO SPECULATIVE POSITION LIMITS; SET THRESHOLDS THAT RESTRICT THE  SIZE OF SPECULATIVE POSITIONS THAT A PERSON MAY HOLD IN THE SPOT MONTH, OTHER INDIVIDUAL MONTHS, AND ALL MONTHS COMBINED; CREATE  AN EXEMPTION FOR POSITIONS THAT CONSTITUTE BONA FIDE HEDGING TRANSACTIONS; IMPOSE RESPONSIBILITIES ON DCMS AND SWAP EXECUTION FACILITIES  (\u201cSEFS\u201d) TO ESTABLISH POSITION LIMITS OR, IN SOME CASES, POSITION ACCOUNTABILITY RULES; AND APPLY TO BOTH FUTURES AND  SWAPS ACROSS FOUR RELEVANT VENUES: OTC, DCMS, SEFS AS WELL AS CERTAIN NON-U.S. LOCATED PLATFORMS. THE CFTC\u2019S FIRST ATTEMPT  AT FINALIZING THE POSITION LIMIT RULES, IN 2011, WAS SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS IN 2012 AND, SINCE THEN, THE  CFTC HAS RE-PROPOSED THEM AND SOLICITED COMMENTS FROM MARKET PARTICIPANTS MULTIPLE TIMES. AT THIS TIME, IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THE POSITION  LIMIT RULES MAY AFFECT UGA, BUT THE EFFECT MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL AND ADVERSE. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, THE POSITION LIMIT RULES MAY NEGATIVELY  IMPACT THE ABILITY OF UGA TO MEET ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES THROUGH LIMITS THAT MAY INHIBIT USCF\u2019S ABILITY TO SELL ADDITIONAL  CREATION BASKETS OF UGA.  UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE POSITION LIMIT RULES  ARE ADOPTED, THE REGULATORY ARCHITECTURE IN EFFECT PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THE POSITION LIMIT RULES WILL GOVERN TRANSACTIONS IN  COMMODITIES AND RELATED DERIVATIVES. UNDER THAT SYSTEM, THE CFTC ENFORCES FEDERAL LIMITS ON SPECULATION IN NINE AGRICULTURAL  PRODUCTS (E.G., CORN, WHEAT AND SOY), WHILE FUTURES EXCHANGES ESTABLISH AND ENFORCE POSITION LIMITS AND ACCOUNTABILITY LEVELS FOR  OTHER AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND CERTAIN ENERGY PRODUCTS (E.G., OIL AND NATURAL GAS). AS A RESULT, UGA MAY BE LIMITED  WITH RESPECT TO THE SIZE OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN ANY COMMODITIES SUBJECT TO THESE LIMITS.  UNDER EXISTING AND RECENTLY ADOPTED CFTC  REGULATIONS, FOR THE PURPOSE OF POSITION LIMITS, A MARKET PARTICIPANT IS GENERALLY REQUIRED, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN NARROW EXCEPTIONS,  TO AGGREGATE ALL POSITIONS FOR WHICH THAT PARTICIPANT CONTROLS THE TRADING DECISIONS WITH ALL POSITIONS FOR WHICH THAT PARTICIPANT  HAS A 10 PERCENT OR GREATER OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN AN ACCOUNT OR POSITION, AS WELL AS THE POSITIONS OF TWO OR MORE PERSONS ACTING  PURSUANT TO AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED AGREEMENT OR UNDERSTANDING WITH THAT PARTICIPANT (THE \u201cAGGREGATION RULES\u201d). THE AGGREGATION  RULES WILL ALSO APPLY WITH RESPECT TO THE POSITION LIMIT RULES IF AND WHEN SUCH POSITION LIMIT RULES ARE ADOPTED.  17  OTC SWAPS  IN OCTOBER 2015, THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER  OF THE CURRENCY, THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, THE FDIC, THE FARM CREDIT ADMINISTRATION, AND THE FEDERAL  HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY (EACH AN \u201cAGENCY\u201d AND, COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cAGENCIES\u201d) JOINTLY ADOPTED FINAL RULES  TO ESTABLISH MINIMUM MARGIN AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR REGISTERED SWAP DEALERS, MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS, SECURITY-BASED SWAP  DEALERS, AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS (\u201cSWAP ENTITIES\u201d) THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF ONE OF  THE AGENCIES (SUCH ENTITIES, \u201cCOVERED SWAP ENTITIES\u201d, AND THE JOINT FINAL RULES, THE \u201cFINAL MARGIN RULES\u201d).  THE FINAL MARGIN RULES WILL SUBJECT NON-CLEARED  SWAPS AND NON-CLEARED SECURITY-BASED SWAPS BETWEEN COVERED SWAP ENTITIES AND SWAP ENTITIES, AND BETWEEN COVERED SWAP ENTITIES AND  FINANCIAL END USERS THAT HAVE MATERIAL SWAPS EXPOSURE (I.E., AN AVERAGE DAILY AGGREGATE NOTIONAL OF $8 BILLION OR MORE IN NON-CLEARED  SWAPS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINAL MARGIN RULES), TO A MANDATORY TWO-WAY MINIMUM INITIAL MARGIN REQUIREMENT. THE MINIMUM  AMOUNT OF THE INITIAL MARGIN REQUIRED TO BE POSTED OR COLLECTED WOULD BE EITHER THE AMOUNT CALCULATED BY THE COVERED SWAP ENTITY  USING A STANDARDIZED SCHEDULE SET FORTH AS AN APPENDIX TO THE FINAL MARGIN RULES, WHICH PROVIDES THE GROSS INITIAL MARGIN (AS A  PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NOTIONAL EXPOSURE) FOR CERTAIN ASSET CLASSES, OR AN INTERNAL MARGIN MODEL OF THE COVERED SWAP ENTITY CONFORMING  TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL MARGIN RULES THAT IS APPROVED BY THE AGENCY HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTICULAR COVERED SWAP  ENTITY. THE FINAL MARGIN RULES SPECIFY THE TYPES OF COLLATERAL THAT MAY BE POSTED OR COLLECTED AS INITIAL MARGIN FOR NON-CLEARED  SWAPS AND NON-CLEARED SECURITY-BASED SWAPS WITH FINANCIAL END USERS (GENERALLY CASH, CERTAIN GOVERNMENT, GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE  SECURITIES, CERTAIN LIQUID DEBT, CERTAIN EQUITY SECURITIES, CERTAIN ELIGIBLE PUBLICLY TRADED DEBT, AND GOLD); AND SETS FORTH HAIRCUTS  FOR CERTAIN COLLATERAL ASSET CLASSES.  THE FINAL MARGIN RULES REQUIRE MINIMUM  VARIATION MARGIN TO BE EXCHANGED DAILY FOR NON-CLEARED SWAPS AND NON-CLEARED SECURITY-BASED SWAPS BETWEEN COVERED SWAP ENTITIES  AND SWAP ENTITIES AND BETWEEN COVERED SWAP ENTITIES AND ALL FINANCIAL END-USERS (WITHOUT REGARD TO THE SWAPS EXPOSURE OF THE PARTICULAR  FINANCIAL END-USER). THE MINIMUM VARIATION MARGIN AMOUNT IS THE DAILY MARK-TO-MARKET CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE SWAP TO THE COVERED  SWAP ENTITY, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT VARIATION MARGIN PREVIOUSLY POSTED OR COLLECTED. FOR NON-CLEARED SWAPS AND SECURITY-BASED SWAPS  BETWEEN COVERED SWAP ENTITIES AND FINANCIAL END-USERS, VARIATION MARGIN MAY BE POSTED OR COLLECTED IN CASH OR NON-CASH COLLATERAL  THAT IS CONSIDERED ELIGIBLE FOR INITIAL MARGIN PURPOSES. VARIATION MARGIN IS NOT SUBJECT TO SEGREGATION WITH AN INDEPENDENT, THIRD-PARTY  CUSTODIAN, AND MAY, IF PERMITTED BY CONTRACT, BE REHYPOTHECATED.  THE INITIAL MARGIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE  FINAL MARGIN RULES ARE BEING PHASED IN OVER TIME, AND THE VARIATION MARGIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL MARGIN RULES ARE CURRENTLY  IN EFFECT. THE FUND IS NOT A COVERED SWAP ENTITY UNDER THE FINAL MARGIN RULES, BUT IT IS A FINANCIAL END-USER. ACCORDINGLY, THE  FUND IS CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO THE VARIATION MARGIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL MARGIN RULES. HOWEVER, THE FUND DOES NOT HAVE  MATERIAL SWAPS EXPOSURE AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE FUND WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE INITIAL MARGIN REQUIREMENTS OF THE FINAL MARGIN RULES.  THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER  PROTECTION ACT (THE \u201cDODD-FRANK ACT\u201d) REQUIRED THE CFTC AND THE SEC TO ADOPT THEIR OWN MARGIN RULES TO APPLY TO  A LIMITED NUMBER OF REGISTERED SWAP DEALERS, SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS, MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS, AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP  PARTICIPANTS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF ONE OF THE AGENCIES. ON DECEMBER 16, 2015 THE CFTC FINALIZED ITS MARGIN  RULES, WHICH ARE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THE FINAL MARGIN RULES AND HAVE THE SAME IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE. THE SEC ADOPTED MARGIN  RULES FOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP DEALERS AND MAJOR SECURITY-BASED SWAP PARTICIPANTS ON JUNE 21, 2019. THE SEC\u2019S MARGIN RULES  ARE GENERALLY ALIGNED WITH THE FINAL MARGIN RULES AND THE CFTC\u2019S MARGIN RULES, BUT THEY DIFFER IN A FEW KEY RESPECTS RELATING  TO TIMING FOR COMPLIANCE AND THE MANNER IN WHICH INITIAL MARGIN MUST BE SEGREGATED. UGA DOES NOT CURRENTLY ENGAGE IN SECURITY-BASED  SWAP TRANSACTIONS AND, THEREFORE, THE SEC\u2019S MARGIN RULES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO APPLY TO UGA.  MANDATORY TRADING AND CLEARING OF SWAPS  CFTC REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT CERTAIN SWAP  TRANSACTIONS BE EXECUTED ON ORGANIZED EXCHANGES OR \u201cSWAP EXECUTION FACILITIES\u201d AND CLEARED THROUGH REGULATED CLEARING  ORGANIZATIONS (\u201cDERIVATIVE CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS\u201d (\u201cDCOS\u201d)), IF THE CFTC MANDATES THE CENTRAL CLEARING  OF A PARTICULAR CLASS OF SWAP AND SUCH SWAP IS \u201cMADE AVAILABLE TO TRADE\u201d ON A SWAP EXECUTION FACILITY. CURRENTLY, SWAP  DEALERS, MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS, COMMODITY POOLS, CERTAIN PRIVATE FUNDS AND ENTITIES PREDOMINANTLY ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES THAT  ARE FINANCIAL IN NATURE ARE REQUIRED TO EXECUTE ON A SWAP EXECUTION FACILITY, AND CLEAR, CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND INDEX-BASED  CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS. AS A RESULT, IF UGA ENTERS INTO AN INTEREST RATE OR INDEX-BASED CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP THAT IS SUBJECT  TO THESE REQUIREMENTS, SUCH SWAP WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE EXECUTED ON A SWAP EXECUTION FACILITY AND CENTRALLY CLEARED. MANDATORY  CLEARING AND \u201cMADE AVAILABLE TO TRADE\u201d DETERMINATIONS WITH RESPECT TO ADDITIONAL TYPES OF SWAPS ARE EXPECTED IN THE  FUTURE, AND, WHEN FINALIZED, COULD REQUIRE UGA TO ELECTRONICALLY EXECUTE AND CENTRALLY CLEAR CERTAIN OTC INSTRUMENTS PRESENTLY  ENTERED INTO AND SETTLED ON A BI-LATERAL BASIS. IF A SWAP IS REQUIRED TO BE CLEARED, INITIAL AND VARIATION MARGIN REQUIREMENTS  ARE SET BY THE RELEVANT CLEARING ORGANIZATION, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES. ADDITIONAL MARGIN MAY  BE REQUIRED AND HELD BY UGA'S FCM.  OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR SWAPS  IN ADDITION TO THE MARGIN REQUIREMENTS  DESCRIBED ABOVE, SWAPS THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE CLEARED AND EXECUTED ON A SEF BUT THAT ARE EXECUTED BILATERALLY ARE ALSO SUBJECT  TO VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS PURSUANT TO CFTC REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REPORTING AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS AND,  DEPENDING ON THE STATUS OF THE COUNTERPARTIES, TRADING DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION REQUIREMENTS.  18  DERIVATIVES REGULATIONS IN NON-U.S.  JURISDICTIONS  IN ADDITION TO U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS, UGA  MAY BE SUBJECT TO NON-U.S. DERIVATIVES LAWS AND REGULATIONS IF IT ENGAGES IN FUTURES AND/OR SWAP TRANSACTIONS WITH NON-U.S. PERSONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, UGA MAY BE IMPACTED BY EUROPEAN LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO THE EXTENT THAT IT ENGAGES IN FUTURES TRANSACTIONS ON  EUROPEAN EXCHANGES OR DERIVATIVES TRANSACTIONS WITH EUROPEAN ENTITIES. OTHER JURISDICTIONS IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO FUTURES  AND DERIVATIVES THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IMPOSED BY THE U.S., INCLUDING POSITION LIMITS, MARGIN, CLEARING AND TRADE EXECUTION  REQUIREMENTS.  MONEY MARKET FUNDS  THE SEC ADOPTED AMENDMENTS TO RULE 2A-7  UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, AS AMENDED (\"1940 ACT\") WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN 2016, TO REFORM MONEY  MARKET FUNDS (\u201cMMFS\u201d). WHILE THE RULE APPLIES ONLY TO MMFS, IT MAY INDIRECTLY AFFECT INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS SUCH AS  UGA. A PORTION OF UGA'S ASSETS THAT ARE NOT USED FOR MARGIN OR COLLATERAL IN THE FUTURES CONTRACTS CURRENTLY ARE INVESTED  IN GOVERNMENT MMFS. UGA DOES NOT HOLD ANY NON-GOVERNMENT MMFS AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE INVESTING IN ANY NON-GOVERNMENT MMFS.  HOWEVER, IF UGA INVESTS IN OTHER TYPES OF MMFS BESIDES GOVERNMENT MMFS IN THE FUTURE, UGA COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INVESTING  IN AN MMF THAT DOES NOT MAINTAIN A STABLE $1.00 NAV OR THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPOSE REDEMPTION FEES AND GATES (TEMPORARY  SUSPENSION OF REDEMPTIONS).  ALTHOUGH SUCH GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUNDS  SEEK TO PRESERVE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT AT $1.00 PER SHARE, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO AND UGA  MAY LOSE MONEY BY INVESTING IN A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND. AN INVESTMENT IN A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND IS NOT INSURED OR  GUARANTEED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE FDIC, OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY. THE SHARE  PRICE OF A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND CAN FALL BELOW THE $1.00 SHARE PRICE. UGA CANNOT RELY ON OR EXPECT A GOVERNMENT MONEY  MARKET FUND\u2019S ADVISER OR ITS AFFILIATES TO ENTER INTO SUPPORT AGREEMENTS OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS TO MAINTAIN THE GOVERNMENT  MONEY MARKET FUND\u2019S $1.00 SHARE PRICE. THE CREDIT QUALITY OF A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND\u2019S HOLDINGS CAN CHANGE RAPIDLY  IN CERTAIN MARKETS, AND THE DEFAULT OF A SINGLE HOLDING COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND\u2019S  SHARE PRICE. DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, THE MARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES HELD BY A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND MAY VARY.  A GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUND\u2019S SHARE PRICE CAN ALSO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED DURING PERIODS OF HIGH REDEMPTION PRESSURES  AND/OR ILLIQUID MARKETS.  PRICE MOVEMENTS  GASOLINE FUTURES PRICES WERE VOLATILE  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT STARTED THE PERIOD  AT $1.3021 PER GALLON. THE HIGH OF THE PERIOD WAS ON APRIL 23, 2019 WHEN THE PRICE REACHED $2.0820 PER GALLON. THE LOW OF  THE PERIOD WAS THE STARTING PRICE FOR THE PERIOD, WHICH WAS $1.3021 PER GALLON. THE PERIOD ENDED WITH THE BENCHMARK FUTURES  CONTRACT AT $1.5665 PER GALLON, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 20.31% OVER THE PERIOD (INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED THAT THESE  REPRESENT PRICES FOR GASOLINE ON A WHOLESALE BASIS AND SHOULD NOT BE DIRECTLY COMPARED TO RETAIL PRICES AT A GASOLINE SERVICE STATION). UGA\u2019S  PER SHARE NAV BEGAN THE PERIOD AT $22.74 AND ENDED THE PERIOD AT $29.11 ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  28.01% OVER THE PERIOD. UGA\u2019S PER SHARE NAV REACHED ITS HIGH FOR THE PERIOD ON APRIL 23, 2019 AT $33.02  AND ITS LOW FOR THE PERIOD WAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD WHEN IT WAS $22.74. THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT PRICES  LISTED ABOVE BEGAN WITH THE FEBRUARY 2019 CONTRACTS AND ENDED WITH THE NOVEMBER 2019 CONTRACTS. THE INCREASE  OF APPROXIMATELY 20.31% ON THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT LISTED ABOVE IS A HYPOTHETICAL RETURN ONLY AND COULD NOT ACTUALLY  BE ACHIEVED BY AN INVESTOR HOLDING FUTURES CONTRACTS. AN INVESTMENT IN FUTURES CONTRACTS WOULD NEED TO BE ROLLED FORWARD DURING  THE TIME PERIOD DESCRIBED IN ORDER TO SIMULATE SUCH A RESULT. FURTHERMORE, THE CHANGE IN THE NOMINAL PRICE OF THESE DIFFERING FUTURES  CONTRACTS, MEASURED FROM THE START OF THE PERIOD TO THE END OF THE PERIOD, DOES NOT REPRESENT THE ACTUAL BENCHMARK RESULTS  THAT UGA SEEKS TO TRACK, WHICH ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED BELOW IN THE SECTION TITLED \u201c  TRACKING UGA'S BENCHMARK  .\u201d  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2019, THE GASOLINE FUTURES MARKET BEGAN THE YEAR IN CONTANGO AND FLIPPED TO BACKWARDATION IN THE SPRING, A REGULAR SEASONAL  OCCURRENCE. DURING PERIODS OF CONTANGO, THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH GASOLINE FUTURES CONTRACT IS LOWER THAN THE PRICE OF THE NEXT  MONTH GASOLINE FUTURES CONTRACT OR CONTRACTS FURTHER AWAY FROM EXPIRATION. ON DAYS WHEN THE MARKET IS IN BACKWARDATION, THE PRICE  OF THE NEAR MONTH GASOLINE FUTURES CONTRACT IS HIGHER THAN THE PRICE OF THE NEXT MONTH GASOLINE FUTURES CONTRACT, OR CONTRACTS  FURTHER AWAY FROM EXPIRATION. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF BACKWARDATION AND CONTANGO ON TOTAL RETURNS, SEE  \u201cTERM  STRUCTURE OF GASOLINE PRICES AND THE IMPACT ON TOTAL RETURNS\u201d  BELOW.  19  VALUATION OF FUTURES CONTRACTS AND THE  COMPUTATION OF THE PER SHARE NAV  THE PER SHARE NAV OF UGA\u2019S SHARES  IS CALCULATED ONCE EACH NYSE ARCA TRADING DAY. THE PER SHARE NAV FOR A PARTICULAR TRADING DAY IS RELEASED AFTER 4:00 P.M. NEW YORK  TIME. TRADING DURING THE CORE TRADING SESSION ON THE NYSE ARCA TYPICALLY CLOSES AT 4:00 P.M. NEW YORK TIME. UGA\u2019S ADMINISTRATOR  USES THE NYMEX CLOSING PRICE (DETERMINED AT THE EARLIER OF THE CLOSE OF THE NYMEX OR 2:30 P.M. NEW YORK TIME) FOR THE CONTRACTS  HELD ON THE NYMEX, BUT CALCULATES OR DETERMINES THE VALUE OF ALL OTHER UGA INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING ICE FUTURES CONTRACTS OR OTHER  FUTURES CONTRACTS, AS OF THE EARLIER OF THE CLOSE OF THE NYSE ARCA OR 4:00 P.M. NEW YORK TIME.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE GASOLINE  MARKET  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  ON FEBRUARY  26, 2008, UGA LISTED ITS SHARES ON THE AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE (THE \u201cAMEX\u201d) UNDER THE TICKER SYMBOL \u201cUGA.\u201d  ON THAT DAY, UGA ESTABLISHED ITS INITIAL OFFERING PRICE AT $50.00 PER SHARE AND ISSUED 300,000 SHARES TO ITS INITIAL AUTHORIZED  PARTICIPANT IN EXCHANGE FOR $15,000,000 IN CASH. AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE AMEX BY NYSE EURONEXT, UGA\u2019S SHARES  CEASED TRADING ON THE AMEX AND COMMENCED TRADING ON THE NYSE ARCA ON NOVEMBER 25, 2008.  SINCE ITS INITIAL OFFERING OF 30,000,000  SHARES, UGA HAS REGISTERED ONE SUBSEQUENT OFFERING OF ITS SHARES: 50,000,000 SHARES WHICH WERE REGISTERED WITH THE SEC ON APRIL  30, 2010. SHARES OFFERED BY UGA IN THE SUBSEQUENT OFFERING WERE SOLD BY IT FOR CASH AT THE SHARES\u2019 PER SHARE NAV AS DESCRIBED  IN THE APPLICABLE PROSPECTUS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, UGA HAD ISSUED 14,800,000 SHARES, 1,050,000 OF WHICH WERE OUTSTANDING.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THERE WERE 65,200,000 SHARES REGISTERED BUT NOT YET ISSUED.  MORE SHARES MAY HAVE BEEN ISSUED BY UGA  THAN ARE OUTSTANDING DUE TO THE REDEMPTION OF SHARES. UNLIKE FUNDS THAT ARE REGISTERED UNDER THE 1940 ACT, SHARES THAT HAVE BEEN  REDEEMED BY UGA CANNOT BE RESOLD BY UGA. AS A RESULT, UGA CONTEMPLATES THAT ADDITIONAL OFFERINGS OF ITS SHARES WILL BE REGISTERED  WITH THE SEC IN THE FUTURE IN ANTICIPATION OF ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES AND REDEMPTIONS.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, UGA HAD THE FOLLOWING  AUTHORIZED PARTICIPANTS: CITADEL SECURITIES LLC, CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC., CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES USA LLC, DEUTSCHE BANK  SECURITIES INC., GOLDMAN SACHS & COMPANY, JP MORGAN SECURITIES INC., MERRILL LYNCH PROFESSIONAL CLEARING CORP., MORGAN STANLEY  & COMPANY INC., NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL INC., RBC CAPITAL MARKETS LLC, SG AMERICAS SECURITIES LLC, AND VIRTU FINANCIAL  BD LLC.  20  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  FOR THE NINE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  FOR THE NINE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS  $38,185,405  $46,052,443  DIVIDEND AND INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON TREASURIES, CASH AND/OR CASH EQUIVALENTS  $643,270  $567,836  ANNUALIZED YIELD BASED ON AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS  2.25%  1.65%  MANAGEMENT FEE  $171,364  $206,668  TOTAL FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES EXCLUDING MANAGEMENT FEES  $96,251  $192,421  FEES AND EXPENSES RELATED TO THE REGISTRATION OR OFFERING OF ADDITIONAL SHARES  $\u2014  $34,745  TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE EXPENSE WAIVER  $53,412  $140,754  EXPENSES BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR THE EXPENSE WAIVER  $267,615  $399,089  EXPENSES AFTER ALLOWANCE FOR THE EXPENSE WAIVER  $214,203  $258,335  TOTAL COMMISSIONS ACCRUED TO BROKERS  $31,733  $31,828  TOTAL COMMISSIONS AS ANNUALIZED PERCENTAGE OF AVERAGE TOTAL NET ASSETS  0.11%  0.09%  COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF REBALANCING  $29,940  $31,069  PERCENTAGE OF COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF REBALANCING  94.35%  97.62%  COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF CREATION AND REDEMPTION ACTIVITY  $1,793  $759  PERCENTAGE OF COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF CREATION AND REDEMPTION ACTIVITY  5.65%  2.38%  PORTFOLIO EXPENSES.

THE MANAGEMENT FEE THAT UGA PAYS TO USCF IS CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL NET ASSETS OF UGA. THE FEE IS ACCRUED  DAILY AND PAID MONTHLY.  AVERAGE INTEREST RATES EARNED ON SHORT-TERM  INVESTMENTS HELD BY UGA, INCLUDING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND TREASURIES, WERE HIGHER DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. AS A RESULT, THE AMOUNT OF INCOME EARNED BY UGA AS A  PERCENTAGE OF AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS WAS HIGHER DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  THE DECREASE IN TOTAL FEES AND OTHER  EXPENSES EXCLUDING MANAGEMENT FEES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2018 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO UGA\u2019S SMALLER SIZE AS MEASURED BY TOTAL NET ASSETS.  THE DECREASE IN TOTAL COMMISSIONS ACCRUED  TO BROKERS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WAS DUE  PRIMARILY TO A LOWER NUMBER OF GASOLINE FUTURES CONTRACTS BEING HELD AND TRADED.  21  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS  $34,184,533  $44,514,852  DIVIDEND AND INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON TREASURIES, CASH AND/OR CASH EQUIVALENTS  $187,372  $217,028  ANNUALIZED YIELD BASED ON AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS  2.17%  1.93%  MANAGEMENT FEE  $51,699  $67,321  TOTAL FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES EXCLUDING MANAGEMENT FEES  $24,467  $57,353  FEES AND EXPENSES RELATED TO THE REGISTRATION OR OFFERING OF ADDITIONAL SHARES  $\u2014  $11,709  TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE EXPENSE WAIVER  $11,544  $40,523  EXPENSES BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR THE EXPENSE WAIVER  $76,166  $124,674  EXPENSES AFTER ALLOWANCE FOR THE EXPENSE WAIVER  $64,622  $84,151  TOTAL COMMISSIONS ACCRUED TO BROKERS  $9,632  $10,375  TOTAL COMMISSIONS AS ANNUALIZED PERCENTAGE OF AVERAGE TOTAL NET ASSETS  0.11%  0.09%  COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF REBALANCING  $8,458  $10,124  PERCENTAGE OF COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF REBALANCING  87.81%  97.58%  COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF CREATION AND REDEMPTION ACTIVITY  $1,174  $251  PERCENTAGE OF COMMISSIONS ACCRUED AS A RESULT OF CREATION AND REDEMPTION ACTIVITY  12.19%  2.42%  PORTFOLIO EXPENSES.  UGA\u2019S  EXPENSES CONSIST OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES, BROKERAGE FEES AND COMMISSIONS, CERTAIN OFFERING COSTS, LICENSING FEES, REGISTRATION  FEES, THE FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF USCF AND EXPENSES RELATING TO TAX ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  THE MANAGEMENT FEE THAT UGA PAYS TO USCF IS CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL NET ASSETS OF UGA. THE FEE IS ACCRUED DAILY  AND PAID MONTHLY.  AVERAGE INTEREST RATES EARNED ON SHORT-TERM  INVESTMENTS HELD BY UGA, INCLUDING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND TREASURIES, WERE HIGHER DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019, COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. HOWEVER, THE AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE LOWER THAN PRIOR YEAR THREE MONTH PERIOD WHICH RESULTED IN A LOWER AMOUNT OF INCOME EARNED BY UGA DURING  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  THE DECREASE IN TOTAL FEES AND OTHER  EXPENSES EXCLUDING MANAGEMENT FEES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2018 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO UGA\u2019S SMALLER SIZE AS MEASURED BY TOTAL NET ASSETS.  THE DECREASE IN TOTAL COMMISSIONS ACCRUED  TO BROKERS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WAS DUE PRIMARILY  TO A LOWER NUMBER OF GASOLINE FUTURES CONTRACTS BEING HELD AND TRADED.  22  TRACKING UGA'S BENCHMARK  USCF SEEKS TO MANAGE UGA'S PORTFOLIO SUCH  THAT CHANGES IN ITS AVERAGE DAILY PER SHARE NAV, ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS, CLOSELY TRACK THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE PRICE  OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT, ALSO ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS. SPECIFICALLY, USCF SEEKS TO MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO SUCH THAT  OVER ANY ROLLING PERIOD OF 30-VALUATION DAYS, THE AVERAGE DAILY CHANGE IN UGA'S PER SHARE NAV IS WITHIN A RANGE OF 90% TO  110% (0.9 TO 1.1) OF THE AVERAGE DAILY CHANGE IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT. AS AN EXAMPLE, IF THE AVERAGE  DAILY MOVEMENT OF THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT FOR A PARTICULAR 30-VALUATION DAY TIME PERIOD WAS 0.50%  PER DAY, USCF WOULD ATTEMPT TO MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO SUCH THAT THE AVERAGE DAILY MOVEMENT OF THE PER SHARE NAV DURING THAT SAME  TIME PERIOD FELL BETWEEN 0.45% AND 0.55% (I.E., BETWEEN 0.9 AND 1.1 OF THE BENCHMARK\u2019S RESULTS). UGA'S PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT  GOALS DO NOT INCLUDE TRYING TO MAKE THE NOMINAL PRICE OF UGA'S PER SHARE NAV EQUAL TO THE NOMINAL PRICE OF THE CURRENT  BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT OR THE SPOT PRICE FOR GASOLINE. USCF BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT PRACTICAL TO MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO TO ACHIEVE  SUCH AN INVESTMENT GOAL WHEN INVESTING IN FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OTHER GASOLINE-RELATED INVESTMENTS.  FOR THE 30-VALUATION DAYS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2019, THE SIMPLE AVERAGE DAILY CHANGE IN THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT WAS 0.182%, WHILE THE SIMPLE AVERAGE DAILY CHANGE  IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF UGA OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD WAS 0.187%. THE AVERAGE DAILY DIFFERENCE WAS 0.005% (OR 0.5 BASIS  POINTS, WHERE 1 BASIS POINT EQUALS 1/100 OF 1%). AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE DAILY MOVEMENT OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT, THE AVERAGE  ERROR IN DAILY TRACKING BY THE PER SHARE NAV WAS (3.052)%, MEANING THAT OVER THIS TIME PERIOD UGA\u2019S TRACKING ERROR WAS  WITHIN THE PLUS OR MINUS 10% RANGE ESTABLISHED AS ITS BENCHMARK TRACKING GOAL.  SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE OFFERING  OF UGA\u2019S SHARES TO THE PUBLIC ON FEBRUARY 26, 2008 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE SIMPLE AVERAGE DAILY CHANGE IN THE BENCHMARK  FUTURES CONTRACT WAS 0.007%, WHILE THE SIMPLE AVERAGE DAILY CHANGE IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF UGA OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD WAS  0.006%. THE AVERAGE DAILY DIFFERENCE WAS (0.001)% (OR (0.1) BASIS POINTS, WHERE 1 BASIS POINT EQUALS 1/100 OF 1%). AS A PERCENTAGE  OF THE DAILY MOVEMENT OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT, THE AVERAGE ERROR IN DAILY TRACKING BY THE PER SHARE NAV WAS (0.453)%,  MEANING THAT OVER THIS TIME PERIOD UGA\u2019S TRACKING ERROR WAS WITHIN THE PLUS OR MINUS 10% RANGE ESTABLISHED AS ITS BENCHMARK  TRACKING GOAL. THE FOLLOWING TWO GRAPHS DEMONSTRATE THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE CHANGES IN UGA\u2019S NAV AND THE CHANGES IN THE  BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT. THE FIRST GRAPH EXHIBITS THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE LAST 30 VALUATION DAYS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  THE SECOND GRAPH MEASURES MONTHLY CHANGES SINCE SEPTEMBER 30, 2014 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  *PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS  23  *PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS  AN ALTERNATIVE TRACKING MEASUREMENT OF  THE RETURN PERFORMANCE OF UGA VERSUS THE RETURN OF ITS BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT CAN BE CALCULATED BY COMPARING THE  ACTUAL RETURN OF UGA, MEASURED BY CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE NAV, VERSUS THE EXPECTED CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE NAV UNDER THE ASSUMPTION  THAT UGA\u2019S RETURNS HAD BEEN EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE DAILY CHANGES IN ITS BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2019, THE ACTUAL TOTAL RETURN OF UGA AS MEASURED BY CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE NAV WAS 28.01%. THIS IS BASED ON AN INITIAL  PER SHARE NAV OF $22.74 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND AN ENDING PER SHARE NAV AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 OF $29.11. DURING  THIS TIME PERIOD, UGA MADE NO DISTRIBUTIONS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS. HOWEVER, IF UGA\u2019S DAILY CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE NAV  HAD INSTEAD EXACTLY TRACKED THE CHANGES IN THE DAILY TOTAL RETURN OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT, UGA WOULD HAVE HAD AN  ESTIMATED PER SHARE NAV OF $28.80 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, FOR A TOTAL RETURN OVER THE RELEVANT TIME PERIOD OF 26.65%. THE DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN THE ACTUAL PER SHARE NAV TOTAL RETURN OF UGA OF 28.01% AND THE EXPECTED TOTAL RETURN BASED ON THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT  OF 26.65% WAS AN ERROR OVER THE TIME PERIOD OF 1.36%, WHICH IS TO SAY THAT UGA\u2019S ACTUAL TOTAL RETURN OUTPERFORMED ITS BENCHMARK BY  THAT PERCENTAGE. UGA INCURS EXPENSES PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF THE MANAGEMENT FEE, BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS FOR THE BUYING AND SELLING  OF FUTURES CONTRACTS, AND OTHER EXPENSES. THE IMPACT OF THESE EXPENSES, OFFSET BY INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME, AND NET OF POSITIVE  OR NEGATIVE EXECUTION, TENDS TO CAUSE DAILY CHANGES IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF UGA TO TRACK SLIGHTLY LOWER OR HIGHER THAN  DAILY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT.  BY COMPARISON, FOR THE NINE MONTHS  ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, THE ACTUAL TOTAL RETURN OF UGA AS MEASURED BY CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE NAV WAS 12.71%. THIS WAS  BASED ON AN INITIAL PER SHARE NAV OF $32.03 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND AN ENDING PER SHARE NAV AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  OF $36.10. DURING THIS TIME PERIOD, UGA MADE NO DISTRIBUTIONS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS. HOWEVER, IF UGA\u2019S DAILY CHANGES IN  ITS PER SHARE NAV HAD INSTEAD EXACTLY TRACKED THE CHANGES IN THE DAILY TOTAL RETURN OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT, UGA  WOULD HAVE HAD AN ESTIMATED PER SHARE NAV OF $35.85 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, FOR A TOTAL RETURN OVER THE RELEVANT TIME PERIOD  OF 11.93%. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ACTUAL PER SHARE NAV TOTAL RETURN OF UGA OF 12.71% AND THE EXPECTED TOTAL RETURN BASED ON  THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT OF 11.93% WAS AN ERROR OVER THE TIME PERIOD OF 0.78%, WHICH IS TO SAY THAT UGA\u2019S ACTUAL TOTAL  RETURN OUTPERFORMED ITS BENCHMARK BY THAT PERCENTAGE. UGA INCURRED EXPENSES PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF THE MANAGEMENT FEE, BROKERAGE  COMMISSIONS FOR THE BUYING AND SELLING OF FUTURES CONTRACTS, AND OTHER EXPENSES. THE IMPACT OF THESE EXPENSES, OFFSET BY INTEREST  AND DIVIDEND INCOME, AND NET OF POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EXECUTION, TENDED TO CAUSE DAILY CHANGES IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF UGA  TO TRACK SLIGHTLY LOWER OR HIGHER THAN DAILY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT.  24  THERE ARE CURRENTLY THREE FACTORS  THAT HAVE IMPACTED OR ARE MOST LIKELY TO IMPACT UGA'S ABILITY TO ACCURATELY TRACK BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT.  FIRST, UGA MAY BUY OR SELL ITS  HOLDINGS IN THE THEN CURRENT BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT AT A PRICE OTHER THAN THE CLOSING SETTLEMENT PRICE OF THAT CONTRACT  ON THE DAY DURING WHICH UGA EXECUTES THE TRADE. IN THAT CASE, UGA MAY PAY A PRICE THAT IS HIGHER, OR LOWER, THAN THAT  OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE CHANGES IN THE DAILY PER SHARE NAV OF UGA TO EITHER BE TOO HIGH OR  TOO LOW RELATIVE TO THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019,  USCF ATTEMPTED TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS BY SEEKING TO EXECUTE ITS PURCHASE OR SALE OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES  CONTRACT AT, OR AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO, THE END OF THE DAY SETTLEMENT PRICE. HOWEVER, IT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE POSSIBLE FOR UGA  TO OBTAIN THE CLOSING SETTLEMENT PRICE AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT FAILURE TO OBTAIN THE CLOSING SETTLEMENT PRICE IN THE FUTURE  WILL NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT UGA'S ATTEMPT TO TRACK THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT.  SECOND, UGA INCURS EXPENSES PRIMARILY  COMPOSED OF THE MANAGEMENT FEE, BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS FOR THE BUYING AND SELLING OF FUTURES CONTRACTS, AND OTHER EXPENSES. THE  IMPACT OF THESE EXPENSES TENDS TO CAUSE DAILY CHANGES IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF UGA TO TRACK SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN DAILY CHANGES  IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT. AT THE SAME TIME, UGA EARNS DIVIDEND AND INTEREST INCOME ON ITS CASH, CASH  EQUIVALENTS AND TREASURIES. UGA IS NOT REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE ANY PORTION OF ITS INCOME TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS AND DID NOT MAKE  ANY DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. INTEREST PAYMENTS, AND ANY OTHER INCOME,  WERE RETAINED WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO AND ADDED TO UGA'S NAV. WHEN THIS INCOME EXCEEDS THE LEVEL OF UGA'S EXPENSES FOR ITS  MANAGEMENT FEE, BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS AND OTHER EXPENSES (INCLUDING ONGOING REGISTRATION FEES, LICENSING FEES AND THE FEES AND  EXPENSES OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF USCF), UGA WILL REALIZE A NET YIELD THAT WILL TEND TO CAUSE DAILY CHANGES IN THE  PER SHARE NAV OF UGA TO TRACK SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN DAILY CHANGES IN THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT. IF SHORT-TERM INTEREST  RATES RISE ABOVE THE CURRENT LEVELS, THE LEVEL OF DEVIATION CREATED BY THE YIELD WOULD INCREASE. CONVERSELY, IF SHORT-TERM INTEREST  RATES WERE TO DECLINE, THE AMOUNT OF ERROR CREATED BY THE YIELD WOULD DECREASE. WHEN SHORT-TERM YIELDS DROP TO A LEVEL LOWER THAN  THE COMBINED EXPENSES OF THE MANAGEMENT FEE AND THE BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS, THEN THE TRACKING ERROR BECOMES A NEGATIVE NUMBER AND  WOULD TEND TO CAUSE THE DAILY RETURNS OF THE PER SHARE NAV TO UNDERPERFORM THE DAILY RETURNS OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT.  USCF ANTICIPATES THAT INTEREST RATES MAY CONTINUE TO DECREASE OVER THE NEAR FUTURE FROM RECENT HIGHS. IT IS ANTICIPATED  THAT FEES AND EXPENSES PAID BY UGA MAY CONTINUE TO BE LOWER THAN INTEREST EARNED BY UGA. AS SUCH, USCF ANTICIPATES THAT UGA  COULD POSSIBLY OUTPERFORM ITS BENCHMARK SO LONG AS INTEREST EARNED AT LEAST EQUALS OR EXCEEDS THE FEES AND  EXPENSES PAID BY UGA.  THIRD, UGA MAY HOLD OTHER GASOLINE-RELATED  INVESTMENTS IN ITS PORTFOLIO THAT MAY FAIL TO CLOSELY TRACK THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT'S TOTAL RETURN MOVEMENTS. IN THAT  CASE, THE ERROR IN TRACKING THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT COULD RESULT IN DAILY CHANGES IN THE PER SHARE NAV OF UGA  THAT ARE EITHER TOO HIGH, OR TOO LOW, RELATIVE TO THE DAILY CHANGES IN THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT. DURING THE NINE MONTHS  ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, UGA DID NOT HOLD ANY OTHER GASOLINE-RELATED INVESTMENTS. IF UGA INCREASES IN SIZE, AND DUE  TO ITS OBLIGATIONS TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY LIMITS, UGA MAY INVEST IN OTHER GASOLINE-RELATED INVESTMENTS WHICH MAY HAVE THE EFFECT  OF INCREASING TRANSACTION RELATED EXPENSES AND MAY RESULT IN INCREASED TRACKING ERROR.  TERM STRUCTURE OF GASOLINE FUTURES PRICES  AND THE IMPACT ON TOTAL RETURNS.  SEVERAL FACTORS DETERMINE THE TOTAL RETURN FROM INVESTING IN FUTURES CONTRACTS. ONE FACTOR  ARISES FROM \u201cROLLING\u201d FUTURES CONTRACTS THAT WILL EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE CURRENT MONTH (THE \u201cNEAR\u201d OR  \u201cFRONT\u201d MONTH CONTRACT) FORWARD EACH MONTH PRIOR TO EXPIRATION. FOR A STRATEGY THAT ENTAILS HOLDING THE NEAR MONTH  CONTRACT, THE PRICE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT FUTURES CONTRACT AND THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WILL IMPACT RETURNS. FOR EXAMPLE,  IF THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS HIGHER THAN THE NEXT FUTURES MONTH CONTRACT (A SITUATION REFERRED TO AS \u201cBACKWARDATION\u201d),  THEN ABSENT ANY OTHER CHANGE, THE PRICE OF A NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT TENDS TO RISE IN VALUE AS IT BECOMES THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES  CONTRACT AND APPROACHES EXPIRATION. CONVERSELY, IF THE PRICE OF A NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS LOWER THAN THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES  CONTRACT (A SITUATION REFERRED TO AS \u201cCONTANGO\u201d), THEN ABSENT ANY OTHER CHANGE, THE PRICE OF A NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT  TENDS TO DECLINE IN VALUE AS IT BECOMES THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT AND APPROACHES EXPIRATION.  AS AN EXAMPLE, ASSUME THAT THE PRICE OF GASOLINE  FOR IMMEDIATE DELIVERY, IS $1.50 PER GALLON, AND THE VALUE OF A POSITION IN THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS ALSO $1.50. OVER  TIME, THE PRICE OF GASOLINE WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON A NUMBER OF MARKET FACTORS, INCLUDING DEMAND FOR OIL RELATIVE TO  SUPPLY. THE VALUE OF THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WILL LIKEWISE FLUCTUATE IN REACTION TO A NUMBER OF MARKET FACTORS. IF AN INVESTOR  SEEKS TO MAINTAIN A POSITION IN A NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT AND NOT TAKE DELIVERY OF PHYSICAL GALLONS OF GASOLINE, THE INVESTOR  MUST SELL THE CURRENT NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT AS IT APPROACHES EXPIRATION AND INVEST IN THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT. IN  ORDER TO CONTINUE HOLDING A POSITION IN THE CURRENT NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT, THIS \u201cROLL\u201d FORWARD OF THE FUTURES  CONTRACT MUST BE EXECUTED EVERY MONTH.  CONTANGO AND BACKWARDATION ARE NATURAL  MARKET FORCES THAT HAVE IMPACTED THE TOTAL RETURN ON AN INVESTMENT IN UGA\u2019S SHARES DURING THE PAST YEAR RELATIVE TO A HYPOTHETICAL  DIRECT INVESTMENT IN GASOLINE. IN THE FUTURE, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MARKET PRICE OF UGA\u2019S SHARES  AND CHANGES IN THE SPOT PRICES OF GASOLINE WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY CONTANGO AND BACKWARDATION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO  NOTE THAT THIS COMPARISON IGNORES THE POTENTIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PHYSICALLY OWNING AND STORING GASOLINE, WHICH COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL.  25  IF THE FUTURES MARKET IS IN BACKWARDATION,  E.G., WHEN THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS HIGHER THAN THE PRICE OF THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT, THE INVESTOR  WOULD BUY A NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT FOR A LOWER PRICE THAN THE CURRENT NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT. ASSUMING THE PRICE OF THE  NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WAS $1.47 PER GALLON, OR 2% CHEAPER THAN THE $1.50 NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT, THEN, HYPOTHETICALLY,  AND ASSUMING NO OTHER CHANGES (E.G., TO EITHER PREVAILING GASOLINE PRICES OR THE PRICE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SPOT PRICE,  THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT AND THE NEXT MONTH CONTRACT, AND, IGNORING THE IMPACT OF COMMISSION COSTS AND THE INCOME EARNED ON CASH  AND/OR CASH EQUIVALENTS), THE VALUE OF THE $1.47 NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WOULD RISE TO $1.50 AS IT APPROACHES EXPIRATION. IN  THIS EXAMPLE, THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WOULD TEND TO OUTPERFORM THE SPOT PRICE OF GASOLINE.  AS A RESULT, IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR THE NEW NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT TO RISE 12% WHILE THE SPOT PRICE OF GASOLINE MAY  HAVE RISEN A LOWER AMOUNT, E.G., ONLY 10%. SIMILARLY, THE SPOT PRICE OF GASOLINE COULD HAVE FALLEN 10% WHILE THE VALUE OF  AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURES CONTRACT MIGHT HAVE FALLEN ANOTHER AMOUNT, E.G., ONLY 8%. OVER TIME, IF BACKWARDATION REMAINED CONSTANT,  THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SPOT PRICE AND THE FUTURES CONTRACT PRICE WOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE.  IF THE FUTURES MARKET IS IN CONTANGO, AN  INVESTOR WOULD BE BUYING A NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT FOR A HIGHER PRICE THAN THE CURRENT NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT.  AGAIN, ASSUMING THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS $1.50 PER GALLON, THE PRICE OF THE NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT MIGHT BE  $1.53 PER GALLON, OR 2% MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE FRONT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT. HYPOTHETICALLY, AND ASSUMING NO OTHER CHANGES, THE  VALUE OF THE $1.53 NEXT MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT WOULD FALL TO $1.50 AS IT APPROACHES EXPIRATION. IN THIS EXAMPLE, THE VALUE OF AN  INVESTMENT IN THE SECOND MONTH WOULD TEND TO UNDERPERFORM THE SPOT PRICE OF GASOLINE. AS A RESULT, IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR THE  NEW NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT TO RISE ONLY 10% WHILE THE SPOT PRICE OF GASOLINE MAY HAVE RISEN A HIGHER AMOUNT, E.G., 12%.  SIMILARLY, THE SPOT PRICE OF GASOLINE COULD HAVE FALLEN 10% WHILE THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE SECOND MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT  MIGHT HAVE FALLEN ANOTHER AMOUNT, E.G., 12%. OVER TIME, IF CONTANGO REMAINED CONSTANT, THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SPOT PRICE AND  THE FUTURES CONTRACT PRICE WOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE.  THE CHART BELOW COMPARES THE DAILY PRICE  OF THE NEAR MONTH GASOLINE FUTURES CONTRACT TO THE PRICE OF 13  TH  MONTH GASOLINE FUTURES CONTRACT (I.E., A  CONTRACT ONE YEAR FORWARD) OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS. WHEN THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS HIGHER THAN THE PRICE OF  THE 13  TH  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT, THE MARKET WOULD BE DESCRIBED AS BEING IN BACKWARDATION. WHEN THE PRICE OF THE NEAR  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT IS LOWER THAN THE 13  TH  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT, THE MARKET WOULD BE DESCRIBED AS BEING IN CONTANGO.  ALTHOUGH THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT AND THE PRICE OF THE 13  TH  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT TEND TO  MOVE TOGETHER, IT CAN BE SEEN THAT AT TIMES THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT PRICES ARE HIGHER THAN THE 13  TH  MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT  PRICES (BACKWARDATION) AND, AT OTHER TIMES, THE NEAR MONTH FUTURES CONTRACT PRICES ARE LOWER THAN THE 13  TH  MONTH FUTURES  CONTRACT PRICES (CONTANGO).  *PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS  26  AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO VIEW THE SAME DATA  IS TO SUBTRACT THE DOLLAR PRICE OF THE 13  TH  MONTH GASOLINE FUTURES CONTRACT FROM THE DOLLAR PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH GASOLINE  FUTURES CONTRACT, AS SHOWN IN THE CHART BELOW. WHEN THE DIFFERENCE IS POSITIVE, THE MARKET IS IN BACKWARDATION. WHEN THE DIFFERENCE  IS NEGATIVE, THE MARKET IS IN CONTANGO. THE GASOLINE MARKET SPENT TIME IN BOTH BACKWARDATION AND CONTANGO DURING THE LAST  TEN YEARS. THE CHART BELOW SHOWS THE RESULTS FROM SUBTRACTING THE NEXT MONTH CONTRACT PRICE FROM THE PRICE OF THE NEAR MONTH CONTRACT  FOR THE 10-YEAR PERIOD BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 30, 2009 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. INVESTORS WILL NOTE THAT THE NEAR MONTH GASOLINE FUTURES  CONTRACT SPENT TIME IN BOTH BACKWARDATION AND CONTANGO.  *PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS  WHILE THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE OF UGA IS  NOT TO HAVE THE MARKET PRICE OF ITS SHARES MATCH, DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR, CHANGES IN THE SPOT PRICE OF GASOLINE, CONTANGO AND BACKWARDATION  HAVE IMPACTED THE TOTAL RETURN ON AN INVESTMENT IN UGA SHARES DURING THE PAST YEAR RELATIVE TO A HYPOTHETICAL DIRECT INVESTMENT  IN GASOLINE. FOR EXAMPLE, AN INVESTMENT IN UGA SHARES MADE ON DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND HELD SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 INCREASED BASED UPON  THE CHANGES IN THE NAV FOR UGA SHARES ON THOSE DAYS, BY APPROXIMATELY 28.04%, WHILE THE SPOT PRICE OF GASOLINE FOR IMMEDIATE DELIVERY  DURING THE SAME PERIOD INCREASED BY 20.31% (NOTE: THIS COMPARISON IGNORES SEASONAL FACTORS AND THE POTENTIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH  PHYSICALLY OWNING AND STORING GASOLINE, WHICH COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL). BY COMPARISON, AN INVESTMENT IN UGA SHARES MADE ON DECEMBER  31, 2017 AND HELD TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 INCREASED BASED UPON THE CHANGES IN THE NAV FOR UGA SHARES ON THOSE DAYS, BY APPROXIMATELY  12.71%, WHILE THE SPOT PRICE OF GASOLINE FOR IMMEDIATE DELIVERY DURING THE SAME PERIOD INCREASED BY 16.14% (NOTE: THIS COMPARISON  IGNORES THE POTENTIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PHYSICALLY OWNING AND STORING GASOLINE, WHICH COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL).  PERIODS OF CONTANGO OR BACKWARDATION DO  NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT UGA\u2019S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE OF HAVING THE DAILY PERCENTAGE CHANGES IN ITS PER SHARE NAV TRACK THE DAILY  PERCENTAGE CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT SINCE THE IMPACT OF BACKWARDATION AND CONTANGO TEND TO EQUALLY  IMPACT THE DAILY PERCENTAGE CHANGES IN PRICE OF BOTH UGA\u2019S SHARES AND THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO  PREDICT WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY WHETHER BACKWARDATION OR CONTANGO WILL OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. IT IS LIKELY THAT BOTH CONDITIONS  WILL OCCUR DURING DIFFERENT PERIODS.  27  GASOLINE MARKET.  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE PRICE OF UNLEADED GASOLINE IN THE UNITED STATES WAS IMPACTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS. IN  PARTICULAR, USCF BELIEVES THAT RISING GLOBAL INVENTORIES OF CRUDE OIL, THE INPUT PRODUCT FOR GASOLINE, AND  MODERATING DEMAND  FOR REFINED GASOLINE RESULTED IN  FLUCTUATING PRICES FOR GASOLINE AND OTHER LIQUID FUELS FOLLOWING AN OVER 60% PRICE GAIN DURING THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF THE YEAR.  CRUDE OIL MARKET.  DURING THE NINE  MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, CRUDE OIL PRICES TRADED IN A RANGE BETWEEN $45.41 TO $66.30. CRUDE OIL ROSE OVER 19.07% FROM THE  END OF 2018 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 FINISHING THE QUARTER AT $54.07. CRUDE IS DOWN 18.45% SINCE ITS APRIL HIGH AS A RESULT OF  FALLING GLOBAL GROWTH FORECASTS, NEGATIVE ECONOMIC NEWS, AND PERSISTENTLY DECLINING OIL DEMAND GROWTH, ALL OF WHICH WERE AT LEAST  PARTIALLY THE RESULT OF THE ONGOING TRADE WARS. PRICES BRIEFLY SPIKED 14.68% FOLLOWING THE SEPTEMBER 16TH ATTACKS ON SAUDI OIL  FACILITIES THAT KNOCKED OUT FIVE PERCENT OF GLOBAL DAILY SUPPLY, BUT QUICKLY FELL BACK ON ONGOING NEGATIVE SENTIMENT AND ECONOMIC  NEWS. AS OF THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, U.S. CRUDE STORAGE WAS 5% HIGHER THAN A YEAR AGO, AND 1% HIGHER THAN THE FIVE-YEAR  AVERAGE LEVEL. OPEC HAS PLEDGED TO DO \u201cWHATEVER IT TAKES\u201d TO SUPPORT OIL PRICES, HOWEVER SOME SIGNS OF FRAYING ALLIANCE  BETWEEN RUSSIA AND SAUDI ARABIA COULD PUT SUCH EFFORTS IN JEOPARDY. WHILE OPEC HAS BEEN AGGRESSIVE ABOUT MEETING TARGET CUTS, CONTINUED  GROWTH IN U.S. SHALE PRODUCTION ALSO THREATENS TO OVERSUPPLY THE MARKET RELATIVE TO DEMAND GROWTH. ALL THREE MAJOR ENERGY AGENCIES  (OPEC, EIA, IEA) HAVE LOWERED THEIR 2019 DEMAND GROWTH FORECASTS. SHOULD DEMAND CONTINUE MODERATING OR TURN NEGATIVE, CRUDE PRICES  WOULD LIKELY FALL FURTHER. HOWEVER, GEOPOLITICAL RISK HAS INCREASED, WHILE A GEOPOLITICAL RISK PREMIUM ONLY BRIEFLY MATERIALIZED  IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE. FURTHER SURPRISE ATTACKS ON CRUDE INFRASTRUCTURE OR CONFLICTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST WOULD LIKELY CREATE SEVERE  VOLATILITY TO THE UPSIDE, SHOULD SUCH EVENTS OCCUR.  USCF BELIEVES THAT OVER BOTH THE MEDIUM-TERM  AND THE LONG-TERM, CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL WILL EXERT THE GREATEST INFLUENCE ON THE PRICE OF REFINED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS  SUCH AS GASOLINE. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE CAN BE OTHER FACTORS THAT, PARTICULARLY IN THE SHORT TERM, CAUSE THE PRICE OF GASOLINE  TO RISE (OR FALL), MORE (OR LESS) THAN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL. FOR EXAMPLE, HIGHER GASOLINE PRICES CAUSE AMERICAN CONSUMERS TO  REDUCE THEIR GASOLINE CONSUMPTION, PARTICULARLY DURING THE HIGH DEMAND PERIOD OF THE SUMMER DRIVING SEASON AND GASOLINE PRICES  ARE IMPACTED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF REFINING CAPACITY. FURTHERMORE, A SLOWDOWN OR RECESSION IN THE U.S. ECONOMY MAY HAVE A GREATER  IMPACT ON U.S. GASOLINE PRICES THAN ON GLOBAL CRUDE OIL PRICES. AS A RESULT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES IN GASOLINE PRICES MAY  NOT MATCH THE CHANGES IN CRUDE OIL PRICES.  UNLEADED GASOLINE PRICE MOVEMENTS IN  COMPARISON TO OTHER ENERGY COMMODITIES AND INVESTMENT CATEGORIES.  USCF BELIEVES THAT INVESTORS FREQUENTLY MEASURE THE DEGREE  TO WHICH PRICES OR TOTAL RETURNS OF ONE INVESTMENT OR ASSET CLASS MOVE UP OR DOWN IN VALUE IN CONCERT WITH ANOTHER INVESTMENT OR  ASSET CLASS. STATISTICALLY, SUCH A MEASURE IS USUALLY DONE BY MEASURING THE CORRELATION OF THE PRICE MOVEMENTS OF THE TWO DIFFERENT  INVESTMENTS OR ASSET CLASSES OVER SOME PERIOD OF TIME. THE CORRELATION IS SCALED BETWEEN 1 AND -1, WHERE 1 INDICATES THAT THE TWO  INVESTMENT OPTIONS MOVE UP OR DOWN IN PRICE OR VALUE TOGETHER, KNOWN AS \u201cPOSITIVE CORRELATION,\u201d AND -1 INDICATES THAT  THEY MOVE IN COMPLETELY OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS, KNOWN AS \u201cNEGATIVE CORRELATION.\u201d A CORRELATION OF 0 WOULD MEAN THAT THE  MOVEMENTS OF THE TWO ARE NEITHER POSITIVELY NOR NEGATIVELY CORRELATED, KNOWN AS \u201cNON-CORRELATION.\u201d THAT IS, THE INVESTMENT  OPTIONS SOMETIMES MOVE UP AND DOWN TOGETHER AND OTHER TIMES MOVE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.  FOR THE TEN-YEAR TIME PERIOD BETWEEN SEPTEMBER  30, 2009 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE TABLE BELOW COMPARES THE MONTHLY MOVEMENTS OF UNLEADED GASOLINE PRICES VERSUS THE MONTHLY  MOVEMENTS OF THE PRICES OF SEVERAL OTHER ENERGY COMMODITIES, SUCH AS NATURAL GAS, CRUDE OIL AND DIESEL-HEATING OIL, AS WELL AS  SEVERAL MAJOR NON-COMMODITY INVESTMENT ASSET CLASSES, SUCH AS LARGE CAP U.S. EQUITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT BONDS AND GLOBAL EQUITIES.  IT CAN BE SEEN THAT OVER THIS PARTICULAR TIME PERIOD, THE MOVEMENT OF GASOLINE ON A MONTHLY BASIS WAS STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH  CRUDE OIL AND DIESEL-HEATING OIL, SOMEWHAT CORRELATED WITH LARGE CAP U.S. EQUITIES AND GLOBAL EQUITIES, UNCORRELATED WITH NATURAL  GAS, AND SOMEWHAT NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT BONDS.  *PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS  U.S.  GOV\u2019T.

THE RESULTS PICTURED ABOVE WOULD  HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF A DIFFERENT RANGE OF DATES HAD BEEN SELECTED. USCF BELIEVES THAT GASOLINE HAS HISTORICALLY NOT DEMONSTRATED  A STRONG CORRELATION WITH EQUITIES OR BONDS OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME. HOWEVER, USCF ALSO BELIEVES THAT IN THE FUTURE IT IS POSSIBLE  THAT GASOLINE COULD HAVE LONG TERM CORRELATION RESULTS THAT INDICATE PRICES OF GASOLINE MORE CLOSELY TRACK THE MOVEMENTS OF EQUITIES  OR BONDS. IN ADDITION, USCF BELIEVES THAT, WHEN MEASURED OVER TIME PERIODS SHORTER THAN TEN YEARS, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOME PERIODS  WHERE THE CORRELATION OF GASOLINE TO EQUITIES AND BONDS WILL BE EITHER MORE STRONGLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED OR MORE STRONGLY NEGATIVELY  CORRELATED THAN THE LONG TERM HISTORICAL RESULTS SUGGEST.  THE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN GASOLINE, CRUDE  OIL, NATURAL GAS AND DIESEL-HEATING OIL ARE RELEVANT BECAUSE USCF ENDEAVORS TO INVEST UGA\u2019S ASSETS IN FUTURES CONTRACTS AND  OTHER GASOLINE-RELATED INVESTMENTS SO THAT DAILY CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS IN UGA\u2019S PER SHARE NAV CORRELATE AS CLOSELY  AS POSSIBLE WITH DAILY CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT. IF CERTAIN OTHER FUEL-BASED  COMMODITY FUTURES CONTRACTS DO NOT CLOSELY CORRELATE WITH THE GASOLINE FUTURES CONTRACT, THEN THEIR USE COULD LEAD TO GREATER TRACKING  ERROR. AS NOTED ABOVE, USCF ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS IN THE PRICE OF THE BENCHMARK FUTURES CONTRACT WILL  CLOSELY CORRELATE WITH CHANGES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS IN THE SPOT PRICE OF GASOLINE.  29  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  PREPARATION OF THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN COMPLIANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  REQUIRES THE APPLICATION OF APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING RULES AND GUIDANCE, AS WELL AS THE USE OF ESTIMATES. UGA'S APPLICATION  OF THESE POLICIES INVOLVES JUDGMENTS AND ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES USED.  USCF HAS EVALUATED THE NATURE AND TYPES  OF ESTIMATES THAT IT MAKES IN PREPARING UGA'S CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES AND HAS DETERMINED THAT  THE VALUATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE NOT TRADED ON A UNITED STATES OR INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED FUTURES EXCHANGE (SUCH  AS FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OTC SWAPS) INVOLVES A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY. THE VALUES WHICH ARE USED BY UGA FOR ITS FUTURES  CONTRACTS ARE PROVIDED BY ITS COMMODITY BROKER WHO USES MARKET PRICES WHEN AVAILABLE, WHILE OTC SWAPS ARE VALUED BASED ON THE PRESENT  VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FROM OR PAID TO A THIRD PARTY IN SETTLEMENT OF THESE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS  PRIOR TO THEIR DELIVERY DATE AND VALUED ON A DAILY BASIS. IN ADDITION, UGA ESTIMATES INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME ON A DAILY  BASIS USING PREVAILING RATES EARNED ON ITS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE ADJUSTED TO THE ACTUAL AMOUNT RECEIVED  ON A MONTHLY BASIS AND THE DIFFERENCE, IF ANY, IS NOT CONSIDERED MATERIAL.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  UGA HAS NOT MADE, AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE  MAKING, USE OF BORROWINGS OR OTHER LINES OF CREDIT TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS. UGA HAS MET, AND IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT UGA  WILL CONTINUE TO MEET, ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS FROM THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE OF ITS INVESTMENTS, OR  FROM THE TREASURIES, CASH AND/OR CASH EQUIVALENTS THAT IT INTENDS TO HOLD AT ALL TIMES. UGA'S LIQUIDITY NEEDS INCLUDE: REDEEMING  SHARES, PROVIDING MARGIN DEPOSITS FOR ITS EXISTING FUTURES CONTRACTS OR THE PURCHASE OF ADDITIONAL FUTURES CONTRACTS  AND POSTING COLLATERAL FOR ITS OTC SWAPS, IF APPLICABLE, AND PAYMENT OF ITS EXPENSES, SUMMARIZED BELOW UNDER  \u201cCONTRACTUAL  OBLIGATIONS.\u201d  UGA CURRENTLY GENERATES CASH  PRIMARILY FROM: (I) THE SALE OF BASKETS CONSISTING OF 50,000 SHARES (\u201cCREATION BASKETS\u201d) AND (II) INCOME EARNED  ON TREASURIES, CASH AND/OR CASH EQUIVALENTS. UGA HAS ALLOCATED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS NET ASSETS TO TRADING IN GASOLINE INTERESTS. UGA  INVESTS IN GASOLINE INTERESTS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE WITHOUT BEING LEVERAGED OR UNABLE TO SATISFY ITS CURRENT OR POTENTIAL  MARGIN OR COLLATERAL OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO ITS INVESTMENTS IN FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OTHER GASOLINE-RELATED INVESTMENTS.  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF UGA'S NAV IS HELD IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS THAT ARE USED AS MARGIN AND AS COLLATERAL FOR ITS  TRADING IN GASOLINE INTERESTS. THE BALANCE OF THE ASSETS IS HELD IN UGA'S ACCOUNT AT ITS CUSTODIAN BANK AND IN TREASURIES  AT THE FCM. INCOME RECEIVED FROM UGA'S INVESTMENTS IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND TREASURIES IS PAID TO UGA. DURING THE NINE  MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, UGA'S EXPENSES DID NOT EXCEED THE INCOME UGA EARNED AND THE CASH EARNED FROM THE SALE  OF CREATION BASKETS AND THE REDEMPTION OF REDEMPTION BASKETS. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, UGA DID NOT USE  OTHER ASSETS TO PAY EXPENSES. TO THE EXTENT EXPENSES EXCEED INCOME, UGA'S NAV WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.  UGA'S INVESTMENTS IN GASOLINE  INTERESTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO PERIODS OF ILLIQUIDITY BECAUSE OF MARKET CONDITIONS, REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS AND OTHER REASONS. FOR  EXAMPLE, MOST COMMODITY EXCHANGES LIMIT THE FLUCTUATIONS IN FUTURES CONTRACTS PRICES DURING A SINGLE DAY BY REGULATIONS REFERRED  TO AS \u201cDAILY LIMITS.\u201d DURING A SINGLE DAY, NO TRADES MAY BE EXECUTED AT PRICES BEYOND THE DAILY LIMIT. ONCE THE PRICE  OF A FUTURES CONTRACT HAS INCREASED OR DECREASED BY AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE DAILY LIMIT, POSITIONS IN THE CONTRACTS CAN NEITHER  BE TAKEN NOR LIQUIDATED UNLESS THE TRADERS ARE WILLING TO EFFECT TRADES AT OR WITHIN THE SPECIFIED DAILY LIMIT. SUCH MARKET CONDITIONS  COULD PREVENT UGA FROM PROMPTLY LIQUIDATING ITS POSITIONS IN FUTURES CONTRACTS. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019, UGA DID NOT PURCHASE OR LIQUIDATE ANY OF ITS POSITIONS WHILE DAILY LIMITS WERE IN EFFECT; HOWEVER, UGA CANNOT  PREDICT WHETHER SUCH AN EVENT MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.  SINCE THE INITIAL OFFERING OF SHARES, UGA HAS  BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPENSES RELATING TO: (I) MANAGEMENT FEES, (II) BROKERAGE FEES AND COMMISSIONS, (III) LICENSING FEES FOR THE  USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, (IV) ONGOING REGISTRATION EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH OFFERS AND SALES OF ITS SHARES SUBSEQUENT TO  THE INITIAL OFFERING, (V) OTHER EXPENSES, INCLUDING TAX REPORTING COSTS, (VI) FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF  USCF AND (VII) OTHER EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES NOT IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHILE USCF HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPENSES  RELATING TO THE FEES OF UGA'S MARKETING AGENT, ADMINISTRATOR AND CUSTODIAN AND REGISTRATION EXPENSES RELATING TO THE INITIAL OFFERING  OF SHARES. IF USCF AND UGA ARE UNSUCCESSFUL IN RAISING SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO COVER THESE RESPECTIVE EXPENSES OR IN LOCATING ANY OTHER  SOURCE OF FUNDING, UGA WILL TERMINATE AND INVESTORS MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF THEIR INVESTMENT.  30  MARKET RISK  TRADING IN FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OTHER  GASOLINE-RELATED INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS FORWARDS, INVOLVES UGA ENTERING INTO CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE OR SELL GASOLINE  AT A SPECIFIED DATE IN THE FUTURE. THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED UGA'S FUTURE CASH  REQUIREMENTS SINCE UGA INTENDS TO CLOSE OUT ITS OPEN POSITIONS PRIOR TO SETTLEMENT. AS A RESULT, UGA IS GENERALLY ONLY  SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS. UGA CONSIDERS THE \u201cFAIR VALUE\u201d  OF ITS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO BE THE UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS ON THE CONTRACTS. THE MARKET RISK ASSOCIATED WITH UGA'S COMMITMENTS  TO PURCHASE GASOLINE IS LIMITED TO THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS HELD. HOWEVER, SHOULD UGA ENTER INTO A CONTRACTUAL  COMMITMENT TO SELL GASOLINE, IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE DELIVERY OF THE GASOLINE AT THE CONTRACT PRICE, REPURCHASE THE CONTRACT  AT PREVAILING PRICES OR SETTLE IN CASH. SINCE THERE ARE NO LIMITS ON THE FUTURE PRICE OF GASOLINE, THE MARKET RISK TO UGA COULD  BE UNLIMITED.  UGA'S EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK DEPENDS  ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE MARKETS FOR GASOLINE, THE VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, THE LIQUIDITY  OF THE FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OTHER GASOLINE-RELATED INVESTMENTS MARKETS AND THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG THE CONTRACTS HELD BY  UGA. DRASTIC MARKET OCCURRENCES COULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO THE LOSS OF ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF AN INVESTOR\u2019S CAPITAL.  CREDIT RISK  WHEN UGA ENTERS INTO FUTURES  CONTRACTS AND OTHER GASOLINE-RELATED INVESTMENTS, IT IS EXPOSED TO THE CREDIT RISK THAT THE COUNTERPARTY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET  ITS OBLIGATIONS. THE COUNTERPARTY FOR THE FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE NYMEX AND ON MOST OTHER FUTURES EXCHANGES IS  THE CLEARINGHOUSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PARTICULAR EXCHANGE. IN GENERAL, IN ADDITION TO MARGIN REQUIRED TO BE POSTED BY THE CLEARINGHOUSE  IN CONNECTION WITH CLEARED TRADES, CLEARINGHOUSES ARE BACKED BY THEIR MEMBERS WHO MAY BE REQUIRED TO SHARE IN THE FINANCIAL BURDEN  RESULTING FROM THE NONPERFORMANCE OF ONE OF THEIR MEMBERS AND, THEREFORE, THIS ADDITIONAL MEMBER SUPPORT SHOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE  CREDIT RISK. UGA IS NOT CURRENTLY A MEMBER OF ANY CLEARINGHOUSE. SOME FOREIGN EXCHANGES ARE NOT BACKED BY THEIR CLEARINGHOUSE  MEMBERS BUT MAY BE BACKED BY A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, UGA FACES THE RISK OF NON-PERFORMANCE  BY ANY COUNTERPARTIES TO OTC CONTRACTS. UNLIKE IN THE CASE OF EXCHANGE-TRADED FUTURES CONTRACTS, THE COUNTERPARTY TO AN OTC CONTRACT  IS GENERALLY A SINGLE BANK OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. AS A RESULT, THERE WILL BE GREATER COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK IN OTC TRANSACTIONS.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY COUNTERPARTY, CLEARINGHOUSE, OR THEIR MEMBERS OR THEIR FINANCIAL BACKERS WILL SATISFY THEIR  OBLIGATIONS TO UGA IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES.  USCF ATTEMPTS TO MANAGE THE CREDIT RISK  OF UGA BY FOLLOWING VARIOUS TRADING LIMITATIONS AND POLICIES. IN PARTICULAR, UGA GENERALLY POSTS MARGIN AND/OR HOLDS  LIQUID ASSETS THAT ARE APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE MARKET VALUE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS TO COUNTERPARTIES UNDER THE FUTURES CONTRACTS  AND OTHER GASOLINE-RELATED INVESTMENTS IT HOLDS. USCF HAS IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES THAT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, EXECUTING  AND CLEARING TRADES ONLY WITH CREDITWORTHY PARTIES AND/OR REQUIRING THE POSTING OF COLLATERAL OR MARGIN BY SUCH PARTIES FOR THE  BENEFIT OF UGA TO LIMIT ITS CREDIT EXPOSURE. AN FCM, WHEN ACTING ON BEHALF OF UGA IN ACCEPTING ORDERS TO PURCHASE OR  SELL FUTURES CONTRACTS ON UNITED STATES EXCHANGES, IS REQUIRED BY CFTC REGULATIONS TO SEPARATELY ACCOUNT FOR AND SEGREGATE  AS BELONGING TO UGA, ALL ASSETS OF UGA RELATING TO DOMESTIC FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADING. THESE FCMS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO  COMMINGLE UGA'S ASSETS WITH THEIR OTHER ASSETS. IN ADDITION, THE CFTC REQUIRES FCMS TO HOLD IN A SECURE ACCOUNT UGA'S  ASSETS RELATED TO FOREIGN FUTURES CONTRACTS TRADING.  IN THE FUTURE, UGA MAY PURCHASE OTC  SWAPS, SEE  \u201cITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\u201d  IN THIS QUARTERLY  REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR A DISCUSSION OF OTC SWAPS.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, UGA HELD  CASH DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS IN TREASURIES AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS IN THE AMOUNT OF $35,333,465 WITH THE CUSTODIAN AND FCM. SOME  OR ALL OF THESE AMOUNTS HELD BY A CUSTODIAN OR AN FCM, AS APPLICABLE, MAY BE SUBJECT TO LOSS SHOULD UGA'S CUSTODIAN OR FCM,  AS APPLICABLE, CEASE OPERATIONS.  31  OFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, UGA HAD  NO LOAN GUARANTEE, CREDIT SUPPORT OR OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OF ANY KIND OTHER THAN AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO IN THE  NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN RISKS THAT SERVICE PROVIDERS UNDERTAKE  IN PERFORMING SERVICES WHICH ARE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF UGA. WHILE UGA'S EXPOSURE UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS  CANNOT BE ESTIMATED, THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON UGA'S FINANCIAL POSITION.  EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT  UGA HAD NO DIRECT EXPOSURE TO EUROPEAN  SOVEREIGN DEBT AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND HAS NO DIRECT EXPOSURE TO EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT AS OF THE FILING OF  THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  REDEMPTION BASKET OBLIGATION  IN ORDER TO MEET ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE  AND PAY ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS DESCRIBED BELOW, UGA REQUIRES LIQUIDITY TO REDEEM SHARES, WHICH REDEMPTIONS MUST BE IN  BLOCKS OF 50,000 SHARES CALLED \u201cREDEMPTION BASKETS.\u201d UGA HAS TO DATE SATISFIED THIS OBLIGATION BY PAYING  FROM THE CASH OR CASH EQUIVALENTS IT HOLDS OR THROUGH THE SALE OF ITS TREASURIES IN AN AMOUNT PROPORTIONATE TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES  BEING REDEEMED.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  UGA'S PRIMARY CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  ARE WITH USCF. IN RETURN FOR ITS SERVICES, USCF IS ENTITLED TO A MANAGEMENT FEE CALCULATED DAILY AND PAID MONTHLY AS A FIXED PERCENTAGE  OF UGA'S NAV, CURRENTLY 0.60% OF NAV ON ITS AVERAGE DAILY TOTAL NET ASSETS.  USCF AGREED TO PAY THE START-UP COSTS ASSOCIATED  WITH THE FORMATION OF UGA, PRIMARILY ITS LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH USCF\u2019S REGISTRATION WITH THE  CFTC AS A CPO AND THE REGISTRATION AND LISTING OF UGA AND ITS SHARES WITH THE SEC, FINRA AND NYSE ARCA (FORMERLY, AMEX), RESPECTIVELY.  HOWEVER, SINCE UGA\u2019S INITIAL OFFERING OF SHARES, OFFERING COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH REGISTERING AND LISTING ADDITIONAL  SHARES OF UGA HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY BORNE ON AN ONGOING BASIS BY UGA, AND NOT BY USCF.  USCF PAYS THE FEES OF THE MARKETING AGENT  AND THE FEES OF BBH&CO., AS WELL AS BBH&CO.\u2019S FEES FOR PERFORMING ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES, INCLUDING THOSE IN CONNECTION  WITH THE PREPARATION OF UGA'S CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ITS SEC, NFA AND CFTC REPORTS. USCF AND UGA HAVE ALSO ENTERED  INTO A LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH THE NYMEX PURSUANT TO WHICH UGA AND THE RELATED PUBLIC FUNDS, OTHER THAN BNO, USCI, CPER, USOU  AND USOD, PAY A LICENSING FEE TO THE NYMEX. UGA ALSO PAYS THE FEES AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS TAX ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS. USCF HAS VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO PAY CERTAIN EXPENSES TYPICALLY BORNE BY UGA TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EXPENSES EXCEEDED  0.15% (15 BASIS POINTS) OF UGA\u2019S NAV, ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. USCF HAS NO OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE SUCH PAYMENTS INTO SUBSEQUENT  PERIODS. THIS VOLUNTARY EXPENSE WAIVER IS IN ADDITION TO THOSE AMOUNTS USCF IS CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO PAY AS DESCRIBED IN  NOTE  4  TO THE  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  IN  ITEM 1  OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  IN ADDITION TO USCF\u2019S MANAGEMENT FEE, UGA PAYS ITS BROKERAGE FEES (INCLUDING FEES TO AN FCM), OTC DEALER SPREADS, ANY LICENSING  FEES FOR THE USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND, SUBSEQUENT TO THE INITIAL OFFERING, REGISTRATION AND OTHER FEES PAID TO THE SEC,  FINRA, OR OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFER AND SALE OF SHARES, AS WELL AS LEGAL, PRINTING, ACCOUNTING AND  OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED THEREWITH, AND EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES. THE LATTER ARE EXPENSES NOT INCURRED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF  UGA\u2019S BUSINESS, INCLUDING EXPENSES RELATING TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OF ANY PERSON AGAINST LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS TO THE  EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND UNDER THE LP AGREEMENT, THE BRINGING OR DEFENDING OF ACTIONS IN LAW OR IN EQUITY OR OTHERWISE CONDUCTING  LITIGATION AND INCURRING LEGAL EXPENSES AND THE SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS AND LITIGATION. COMMISSION PAYMENTS TO AN FCM ARE ON A CONTRACT-BY-CONTRACT,  OR ROUND TURN, BASIS. UGA ALSO PAYS A PORTION OF THE FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF USCF. SEE  NOTE 3  TO  THE  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  IN  ITEM 1  OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  THE PARTIES CANNOT ANTICIPATE THE AMOUNT  OF PAYMENTS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS FOR FUTURE PERIODS, AS UGA'S PER SHARE NAVS AND TRADING LEVELS  TO MEET ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL A FUTURE DATE. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR A SPECIFIC TERM AGREED  UPON BY THE PARTIES WITH AN OPTION TO RENEW, OR, IN SOME CASES, ARE IN EFFECT FOR THE DURATION OF UGA'S EXISTENCE. EITHER  PARTY MAY TERMINATE THESE AGREEMENTS EARLIER FOR CERTAIN REASONS DESCRIBED IN THE AGREEMENTS.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, UGA'S PORTFOLIO  CONSISTED OF 465 RBOB GASOLINE FUTURES RB CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE NYMEX. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, UGA DID NOT HOLD ANY FUTURES  CONTRACTS TRADED ON THE ICE FUTURES.

THE DECLINE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REDUCTION OF DEPRECIATION  RECORDED ON LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND IMPAIRED ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ELIMINATION OF THE XMAX AND FEDERAL DIVISIONS DURING THE  FISCAL YEAR 2018.  OTHER  CHANGES  IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES  THE  FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $0.3 MILLION AND $1.0 MILLION,  RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO $0.8 MILLION AND $2.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018,  REPRESENTING A DECREASE OF $0.5 MILLION OR 63% AND $1.5 MILLION OR 60% RESPECTIVELY.

COST  REDUCTIONS  THE  COMPANY HAS SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVED $1.3 MILLION OF COST REDUCTIONS PRIMARILY RELATED TO FACILITIES CONSOLIDATION, WHICH INCLUDES  CONSOLIDATING THE TWO SITES IN COLCHESTER, U.K., INTO ONE LOCATION. THE COMPANY EXPECTS SAVINGS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATION  TO BE APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2020. BESIDES, OUR BILLERICA FACILITY WAS SUBLEASED IN JUNE 2019 WITH ANTICIPATED  SAVINGS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE OF $0.6 MILLION. ALSO, AS PART OF COST-CUTTING MEASURES, THE COMPANY DID NOT RENEW THE OFFICE  OR WAREHOUSE SPACE IT LEASES IN SUNRISE, FLORIDA, WHICH ACHIEVED ANNUAL SAVINGS OF $0.2 MILLION.  24  LIQUIDITY  THE  ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO ASSUME THE COMPANY CAN CONTINUE AS A  GOING CONCERN, WHICH CONTEMPLATES CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS THROUGH THE REALIZATION OF ASSETS AND THE SETTLING OF LIABILITIES IN  THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY RECEIVED GROSS PROCEEDS  OF $11,995,550 FROM THE OFFERING, BEFORE DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING-RELATED FEES AND OTHER OFFERING EXPENSES PAYABLE BY THE COMPANY.  THE  COMPANY USED THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE EQUITY FINANCING TO SATISFY OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AND ACCRUED INTEREST DUE ON CONVERTIBLE  PROMISSORY NOTES AND, PROVIDED WORKING CAPITAL FOR DAILY OPERATING EXPENDITURES.

AS SUCH, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ABOVE COST REDUCTION INITIATIVE WE BELIEVE  THERE IS ENOUGH FUNDS TO MITIGATE THE GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY FOR AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE AND ULTIMATELY CASH RECEIPTS IS CONTINGENT UPON, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE OF  THE DELIVERED EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES. OUR ASSET CARRYING VALUE COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CLOSE ON SOME  REVENUE-PRODUCING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE NEAR TERM.  NASDAQ  COMPLIANCE  NASDAQ  COMPLIANCE.  ON  SEPTEMBER 26, 2019, WE RECEIVED A WRITTEN NOTIFICATION FROM THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) INDICATING THAT  THE COMPANY WAS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH NASDAQ LISTING RULE 5550(A)(2) AS THE COMPANY\u2019S CLOSING BID PRICE WAS BELOW $1.00  PER SHARE FOR THE PREVIOUS THIRTY (30) CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS.  PURSUANT  TO THE NASDAQ LISTING RULE 5810(C)(3)(A), THE COMPANY HAS BEEN GRANTED A 180 CALENDAR DAY COMPLIANCE PERIOD, OR UNTIL MARCH 24,  2020, TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MINIMUM BID PRICE REQUIREMENTS. DURING THE COMPLIANCE PERIOD, THE COMPANY\u2019S SHARES OF  COMMON STOCK WILL CONTINUE TO BE LISTED AND TRADED ON NASDAQ.  TO  REGAIN COMPLIANCE, THE CLOSING BID OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SHARES OF COMMON STOCK MUST MEET OR EXCEED $1.00 PER SHARE FOR AT LEAST  TEN (10) CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS DURING THE 180 CALENDAR DAY GRACE PERIOD. IF THE COMPANY IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE BY MARCH 24,  2020, THE COMPANY MAY BE AFFORDED A SECOND 180 CALENDAR DAY GRACE PERIOD. TO QUALIFY, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MEET THE  CONTINUED LISTING REQUIREMENT FOR MARKET VALUE OF PUBLICLY HELD SHARES AND ALL OTHER INITIAL LISTING STANDARDS FOR THE NASDAQ  CAPITAL MARKET, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE MINIMUM BID PRICE REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY  NASDAQ OF ITS INTENT TO CURE THE MINIMUM BID PRICE DEFICIENCY BY EFFECTING A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT, IF NECESSARY.  IF  THE COMPANY DOES NOT REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITHIN THE ALLOTTED COMPLIANCE PERIOD(S), INCLUDING ANY EXTENSIONS THAT MAY BE GRANTED  BY NASDAQ, NASDAQ WILL PROVIDE NOTICE THAT THE COMPANY\u2019S SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WILL BE SUBJECT TO DELISTING. THE COMPANY  INTENDS TO MONITOR ITS CLOSING BID PRICE FOR ITS COMMON STOCK BETWEEN NOW AND MARCH 24, 2020, AND WILL CONSIDER AVAILABLE OPTIONS  TO RESOLVE THE COMPANY\u2019S NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE MINIMUM BID PRICE REQUIREMENT, AS MAY BE NECESSARY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE  THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MINIMUM BID PRICE REQUIREMENT OR WILL OTHERWISE BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH  OTHER NASDAQ LISTING CRITERIA.  IN  THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK IS DELISTED FROM THE NASDAQ, AND IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR QUOTATION ON ANOTHER MARKET  OR EXCHANGE, TRADING OF ITS COMMON STOCK COULD BE CONDUCTED IN THE OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKET OR ON AN ELECTRONIC BULLETIN BOARD  ESTABLISHED FOR UNLISTED SECURITIES SUCH AS THE PINK SHEET OR THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD. IN SUCH EVENT, IT COULD BECOME MORE DIFFICULT  TO DISPOSE OF, OR OBTAIN ACCURATE PRICE QUOTATIONS FOR, THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK, AND THERE WOULD LIKELY ALSO BE A REDUCTION  IN THE COMPANY\u2019S COVERAGE BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS AND THE NEWS MEDIA, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE PRICE OF ITS COMMON STOCK TO  DECLINE FURTHER. ALSO, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR THE COMPANY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IF IT IS NOT LISTED ON A MAJOR EXCHANGE.  25  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE  DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT  ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT ARE MATERIAL TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Vislink Technologies, Inc.", "CIK": 1565228, "Date": "2019-11-14T00:00:00", "Ticker": "VISL", "Name": "XG Technology Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 3669.0, "Business": "FL", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 205856795.0, "key": "20191114VISL", "labelr1": -12.903225806451607, "labelr2": 18.518518518518512, "labelr3": -12.499999999999993, "labelr4": 10.714285714285703, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.55662477, "prof1": 0.44337523, "return1&2": 0.9199522102747908, "return1&2&3": 1.0349462365591398, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9240591397849464, "return2": 0.8148148148148149, "return1": 1.1290322580645158, "return3": 1.125, "return4": 0.892857142857143, "1_day_return": -12.9032258064516, "cumulative_return1": 0.00042109348733778454, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.00018266702848556503, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 1.4936755793453815e-06, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 9.516767232628746e-07, "indexx": 3545, "cumreturn1b": 1.1167740373092505, "cumreturndow": 1.0174605875413794, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0240436833766517}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3576, "level_0": 7714, "index": 94278, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  HISTORICALLY,  OUR PRIMARY OPERATIONS INVOLVED THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF A LINE OF PROPRIETARY HIGH AND LOW TEMPERATURE DYEING  AND FINISHING MACHINERY TO THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY. OUR PRODUCTS FEATURE A HIGH DEGREE OF BOTH AUTOMATION AND MECHANICAL-ELECTRICAL  INTEGRATION. OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED IN DYEING YARNS SUCH AS PURE COTTON, COTTON-POLYESTER, TERYLENE, POLYESTER WOOL, POLY-ACRYLIC  FIBER, NYLON, COTTON RAMIE, AND WOOL YARN. WE ARE CONTINUING TO SEEK TO UTILIZE OUR EXPERTISE IN MANUFACTURING PRECISION PRODUCTS  TO MEET DEMAND IN NEW AND EXISTING END MARKETS.  WE DESIGN AND  PRODUCE AIRFLOW DYEING MACHINES, WHICH USE AIR INSTEAD OF WATER. WATER IS USED IN THE TRADITIONAL DYEING PROCESS. WE BELIEVE THAT  OUR AIR-FLOW TECHNOLOGY, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO ENABLE USERS TO MEET THE STRICTER ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS, RESULTS IN REDUCED INPUT  COSTS, FEWER WRINKLES, LESS DAMAGE TO THE TEXTILE, AND REDUCED EMISSIONS. HISTORICALLY, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT\u2019S MANDATE  TO PHASE OUT OLDER MACHINERY IN CHINA\u2019S TEXTILE INDUSTRY THAT DOES NOT MEET THE NEW ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS HAS BENEFITTED  US. HOWEVER, IN RECENT YEARS, CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCREASES IN RAW MATERIALS PRICES AND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT\u2019S  MORE AGGRESSIVE STANCE TOWARD SHUTTING DOWN FACTORIES, INCLUDING TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS, THAT ARE NOT COMPLIANT WITH EMISSION STANDARDS,  HAVE ADVERSELY IMPACTED OUR DYEING AND FINISHING BUSINESSES. DUE TO RISING PRODUCTION COSTS, MANY OTHER TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS ARE  CLOSING OR RELOCATING TO OTHER COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF CHINA IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.  IN AN EFFORT TO  IMPROVE OUR PRODUCT OFFERING AND APPEAL TO TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS OUTSIDE OF OUR CURRENT CUSTOMER BASE IN CHINA, WE HAVE DEVELOPED  PROTOTYPES OF NEXT GENERATION DYEING AND FINISHING EQUIPMENT UTILIZING A PATENT WE PURCHASED IN AUGUST 2016 THAT COVERS OZONE-ULTRASONIC  TEXTILE DYEING EQUIPMENT. DUE TO THE CHALLENGING CONDITIONS FACING OUR CUSTOMERS, INCREASING RAW MATERIALS PRICES AND LABOR COSTS,  WE HAVE NOT RECORDED ANY REVENUES FROM THIS PATENT AND BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY TO YIELD SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT,  WE RECORDED A $1.9 MILLION IMPAIRMENT LOSS ON THIS ASSET DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.  WE ARE ALSO DIVERSIFYING OUR MANUFACTURING  OPERATIONS TO TARGET OTHER INDUSTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY AND ARE CONSTRUCTING A MOBILE PHONE COVER PRODUCTION LINE.  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, THE LINE IS NEARLY COMPLETED AND WE EXPECT TO BEGIN PRODUCTION IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2019.  WE ARE ACTIVELY EXPLORING OTHER NEW VENTURES AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO OUR BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE. WE EXPECT OUR  REVENUE FROM DYEING AND FINISHING EQUIPMENT SEGMENT WILL REMAIN AT OR ABOUT ITS CURRENT QUARTERLY LEVEL IN THE NEAR FUTURE, ALTHOUGH  DECLINES ARE POSSIBLE.  21  ON DECEMBER 26, 2016, DYEING AND XUE MIAO,  AN UNRELATED INDIVIDUAL, FORMED SHENGXIN, IN WHICH DYEING HAS A 30% EQUITY INTEREST AND THE UNRELATED THIRD PARTY HOLDS A 70% INTEREST,  PURSUANT TO AN AGREEMENT DATED DECEMBER 23, 2016.

IN APRIL 2018, SHENGXIN SECURED AND INVESTED  IN A LARGE SOLAR PV PROJECT IN GUIZHOU PROVINCE. SHENGXIN PAID RMB40 MILLION FOR THE PROJECT RIGHTS AND ALSO ENGAGED A LOCAL CONTRACTOR  TO PROCEED WITH BUILDING THE PROJECT. HOWEVER, ON JUNE 1, 2018, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HALTED INSTALLATION OF NEW SOLAR FARMS FOR  THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR AND REDUCED SUBSIDIES FOR PROJECTS ALREADY UNDER CONSTRUCTION. ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT  THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WILL INVEST IN NEW SOLAR FARM OR PROVIDE THE SUBSIDIES NEEDED TO FUND PROJECTS.  OUR INVESTMENT IN SHENGXIN IS SUBJECT TO  A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. WE CANNOT GIVE ANY ASSURANCE THAT SHENGXIN WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ANY PERMITS, RAISE ANY REQUIRED FUNDING,  DEVELOP AND OPERATE OR SELL ANY SOLAR FARMS OR OPERATE PROFITABLY OR THAT DYEING WILL HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE ANY FUNDS THAT  MAY BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO FUND ANY SOLAR FARM PROJECTS FOR WHICH SHENGXIN MAY OBTAIN PERMITS. THERE MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT DELAY  BETWEEN THE TIME FUNDS ARE ADVANCED FOR ANY PROJECT AND THE REALIZATION OF REVENUE OR CASH FLOW FROM ANY PROJECT. IN SEPTEMBER  2018, DUE TO SIGNIFICANT DOUBT ABOUT THE STATUS OF THIS PROJECT AND RECOVERABILITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT, WE FULLY  IMPAIRED THE VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT IN SHENGXIN IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $8.7 MILLION (EQUIVALENT TO RMB 59.8 MILLION).  THROUGH DECEMBER 30, 2016, WE OPERATED  IN THE FORGED ROLLED RINGS AND RELATED COMPONENTS SEGMENT, IN WHICH WE MANUFACTURED AND SOLD PRECISION FORGED ROLLED RINGS, SHAFTS,  FLANGES, AND OTHER FORGED COMPONENTS FOR THE ENERGY INDUSTRY INCLUDING WIND POWER AND OTHER INDUSTRIES, ON DECEMBER 30, 2016, WE  SOLD THE STOCK IN FULLAND WIND, THE SUBSIDIARY THAT OPERATED OUR FORGED ROLLED RINGS AND RELATED COMPONENTS BUSINESS, TO A NON-AFFILIATED  THIRD PARTY.  ADDITIONALLY,  DURING 2016, WE OPERATED A PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT SEGMENT, IN WHICH WE MANUFACTURED AND SOLD PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT.  BECAUSE OF A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN REVENUES FROM THIS SEGMENT, WE DETERMINED THAT WE WOULD NOT CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN THIS SEGMENT  AND ACCORDINGLY, THE PETROLEUM AND CHEMICAL EQUIPMENT SEGMENT IS REFLECTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  RECENTLY, DIFFICULT  ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT IN CHINA AND TRADE TENSIONS WITH THE US PRESENTED NUMEROUS CHALLENGES FOR OUR  BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, WE EXPERIENCED SOFTER DEMAND FOR OUR LOW-EMISSION AIRFLOW DYEING MACHINES AS MANY OF OUR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS  ALREADY UPGRADED TO NEWER MODELS AND WE BELIEVE THAT MUCH OF OUR REMAINING POTENTIAL CUSTOMER BASE DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO  MAKE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT THIS TIME. AS A RESULT, IF WE ARE TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO THE SMALLER TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS,  IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR US TO DESIGN AND MARKET A CHEAPER MACHINE THAT MEETS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS OR REDUCE PRICES  WHICH WOULD IMPACT BOTH REVENUES AND GROSS MARGIN.  OUR ABILITY TO  EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS AND INCREASE OUR REVENUE IS LARGELY AFFECTED BY THE PRC GOVERNMENT\u2019S POLICY ON SUCH MATTERS AS THE  AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, WHICH AFFECTS ALL OF OUR OPERATIONS, AND ITS POLICIES RELATING TO THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY, ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES  AND ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AS WELL AS THE COMPETITIVENESS OF CHINESE TEXTILE MANUFACTURERS AT A TIME WHEN CONSUMERS ARE LOOKING FOR  LOWER PRICES AND MANUFACTURERS ARE LOOKING TO PRODUCE IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS LOWER LABOR COSTS THAN CHINA, ALL OF WHICH AFFECTS  THE MARKET FOR OUR DYEING AND FINISHING EQUIPMENT. OUR BUSINESS IS ALSO AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND WE CANNOT ASSURE  YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO INCREASE OUR REVENUES IN THE NEAR FUTURE, IF AT ALL. FOR EXAMPLE, TARIFFS LEVIED ON CHINESE TEXTILE  MANUFACTURERS BY THE US HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR CUSTOMERS AND LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT FROM US. BECAUSE  OF THE NATURE OF OUR PRODUCTS, OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THEIR DECISIONS  AS TO WHETHER TO PURCHASE CAPITAL EQUIPMENT AT THIS TIME OR DEFER SUCH PURCHASES UNTIL A FUTURE DATE.  GIVEN THE HEADWINDS  AFFECTING OUR MANUFACTURING BUSINESS, WE CONTINUED TO PURSUE WHAT WE BELIEVE ARE HIGH GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COMPANY, PARTICULARLY  OUR NEW BUSINESS DIVISIONS FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHARING ECONOMY PLATFORMS AND RELATED RENTAL BUSINESSES WITHIN THE COMPANY.  THESE INITIATIVES ARE STILL IN AN EARLY STAGE AND ARE DEPENDENT IN LARGE PART ON AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL TO FUND THEIR FUTURE GROWTH.  WE DID NOT GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES FROM OUR SHARING ECONOMY BUSINESS INITIATIVES IN 2018 OR DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  22  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  INSPIRIT STUDIO  DURING THE PERIOD, BUDDIGO, THE SHARING ECONOMY MOBILE PLATFORM DEVELOPED BY INSPIRIT STUDIO LIMITED (\u201cINSPIRIT STUDIO\u201d),  CONTINUOUSLY PROMOTED ITS SERVICE TO THE LOCAL MARKET IN HONG KONG. BUDDIGO OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF ERRAND SERVICES. CURRENTLY,  ABOUT 80 PERCENT OF THE ORDERS RECEIVED ARE FOR ON-DEMAND URGENT DELIVERY OF ITEMS SUCH AS DOCUMENTS, FLOWERS AND CAKES. FOOD DELIVERY  SERVICES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE. DURING THE PERIOD FROM SEPTEMBER 2018 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OVER 1,200 INDIVIDUALS HAVE OFFICIALLY  REGISTERED AS SELL-SIDE BUDDIES, WHO COMPLETED OVER 600 DELIVERY ORDERS FROM SEPTEMBER 2018 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, MAJORITY ORDERS  WERE HAPPENED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF YEAR 2018. IN ADDITION, BUDDIGO HAS SIGNED UP WITH A NUMBER OF LOCAL BUSINESS PARTNERS TO  PROVIDE ONGOING DELIVERY SERVICES FOR THESE CLIENTS. BUDDIGO\u2019S GOAL IS TO CONNECT WITH THE COMMUNITY AND DELIVER LOCALIZED  CONTENT FEATURING BUDDIGO\u2019S CORE FEATURES AND ADVANTAGES. BUDDIGO IS ACTIVELY SEEKING STRATEGIC INVESTORS OR COLLABORATIVE  PARTIES WHO ARE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT ITS BUSINESS MODEL AND CAN HELP ACHIEVE ITS BUSINESS TARGETS AND EXPAND INTO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.  ANYWORKSPACE LIMITED  ANYWORKSPACE, OUR COWORKING BUSINESS UNIT,  IS FOCUSED ON ENLARGING ITS EXPOSURE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. ANYWORKSPACE STARTED SHOWING POSITIVE TRACTION IN INDIA AS SPACE PROVIDERS  FROM NEW DELHI AND GURGAON HAVE SIGNED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS WITH US. WE ARE CURRENTLY REVAMPING ANYWORKSPACE\u2019S CORPORATE  WEBSITE, WWW.ANYWORKSPACE.COM. ANYWORKSPACE WILL ALSO FOCUS ON DIGITAL MARKETING ACTIVITIES FOR ITS MARKET EXPANSION PLANS WHEN  THERE IS AVAILABLE CASH FLOW OR FUNDS FROM INVESTORS.  GIVEN THE EXISTING COWORKING SPACES PROVIDERS  MARKETING THEIR AVAILABLE SPACES AND MANAGING INDIVIDUAL ONLINE BUSINESS PLATFORM THEMSELVES, WE EXPECT OUR CURRENT GLOBAL ONLINE  PLATFORM WILL TAKE YEARS TO MATERIALIZE ITS WORLDWIDE CUSTOMER BASE. THEREFORE, THE INTANGIBLE ASSET AMOUNTED TO $0.6 MILLION (EQUIVALENT  TO HK$4.97 MILLION) REPRESENTING THE ONLINE PLATFORM ACQUIRED HAS BEEN FULLY IMPAIRED IN THE LAST QUARTER OF 2018.  3D DISCOVERY CO. LIMITED  3D DISCOVERY, AN IT SERVICE PROVIDER THAT  DEVELOPS VIRTUAL TOURS FOR THE REAL ESTATE, HOSPITALITY AND INTERIOR DESIGN INDUSTRIES. 3D DISCOVERY\u2019S SPACE CAPTURING AND  MODELING TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY USED BY SOME OF HONG KONG\u2019S LEADING PROPERTY AGENCIES TO PROVIDE THEIR CLIENTS WITH  A TRULY IMMERSIVE, FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE OF A PHYSICAL SPACE WHILE SAVING THEM TIME AND MONEY. ACCORDING TO GOLDMAN SACHS, THE  REAL ESTATE VIRTUAL REALITY (\u201cVR\u201d) INDUSTRY IS PREDICTED TO REACH $2.6 BILLION IN 2025, SUPPORTED BY A POTENTIAL  USER BASE OF OVER 1.4 MILLION REGISTERED REAL ESTATE AGENTS IN SOME OF THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST MARKETS. APART FROM ITS EXISTING  PROFITABLE OPERATIONS, 3D DISCOVERY IS DEVELOPING A MOBILE APP, AUTOCAP, WHICH ALLOWS USERS TO CREATE AN INTERACTIVE VIRTUAL TOUR  OF A PHYSICAL SPACE BY USING A MOBILE PHONE CAMERA.  3D DISCOVERY SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED A NUMBER OF PROJECTS DURING  THE YEAR. FIRST, ITS \u201c3D VIRTUAL TOURS IN HONG KONG\u201d GENERATED ABOUT 1,371,000 IMPRESSIONS IN 2018. IN ADDITION, 3D  DISCOVERY PARTNERED WITH MIDLAND REALTY, ONE OF THE LARGEST REAL ESTATE AGENCIES IN HONG KONG, TO ESTABLISH THE \u201cCREATION  200 3D VIRTUAL TOURS.\u201d.  EC ADVERTISING  LIMITED  FOLLOWING THE  ACQUISITION OF BUDDIGO, ANYWORKSPACE AND 3D DISCOVERY BY THE COMPANY DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN LATE 2017 AND THE FIRST HALF YEAR  OF 2018, EC ADVERTISING LIMITED (\u201cEC ADVERTISING\u201d) HAS BEEN DEVELOPING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THESE THREE PLATFORMS TO ATTRACT  ADVERTISERS.  DURING THE PERIOD,  WE ESTABLISHED A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY IN XIAMEN, FUJIAN PROVINCE OF MAINLAND CHINA, WHICH IS INTENDED TO COVER OUR ADVERTISING  BUSINESS IN THIS REGION. WE STARTED MEETING WITH A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL CLIENTS THERE AND ANTICIPATE THAT THIS ADVERTISING COMPANY  WILL CONFIRM WITH THEM SEVERAL MARKETING CAMPAIGNS. IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE OUR EXPOSURE TO THE POTENTIAL CLIENTS IN MAINLAND CHINA,  WE ARE DEVELOPING A STRATEGIC MEDIA PLAN WHICH WILL COVER MAJOR CITIES IN MAINLAND CHINA SUCH AS BEIJING, SHANGHAI, GUANGZHOU AND  SHENZHEN. MAJOR BANKS, REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS ARE OUR TARGET CLIENTS. MORE IMPORTANTLY,  OUR PRESENCE IN MAINLAND CHINA CAN FACILITATE THE ROLLOUT OF FRANCHISE PROGRAMS OF OUR BUSINESS UNITS, WHICH IS ONE OF THE REVENUE  DRIVERS FOR THE COMPANY.  23  ECRENT PLATFORM  BUSINESS  ASIA REGION.  IN 2018, OUR SUBSIDIARY SEIL ENTERED INTO  A LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH ECRENT, REGARDING THE GRANT OF AN EXCLUSIVE AND SUBLICENSABLE LICENSE FROM ECRENT TO SEII TO UTILIZE CERTAIN  SOFTWARE AND TRADEMARKS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP, LAUNCH, OPERATE, COMMERCIALIZE, AND MAINTAIN AN ONLINE WEBSITE PLATFORM IN TAIWAN,  THAILAND, INDIA, INDONESIA, SINGAPORE, MALAYSIA, PHILIPPINES, VIETNAM, CAMBODIA, JAPAN, AND KOREA. ACCORDING TO THE LATEST AMENDMENT,  ECRENT WILL GUARANTEE THAT THE OPERATION OF ITS RELATED WEBSITES, MOBILE APPLICATIONS AND BUSINESS SERVICES WILL CONTRIBUTE REVENUE  OF $13,000,000 (INCREASED FROM $10,000,000 ACCORDING TO THE PREVIOUSLY AMENDED AGREEMENT) AND GROSS PROFIT OF $2,522,000 (UP FROM  $1,940,000 AS STATED ON THE PREVIOUSLY AMENDED AGREEMENT) FROM THE CLOSING DATE OF THE LICENSE AGREEMENT THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019  (EXTENDED FROM SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 PER THE PREVIOUSLY AMENDED AGREEMENT).  IN AUGUST 2018, SEIL HAS ENTERED INTO A  LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH PTI CORPORATION (\u201cPTI\u201d), THAT SUBLICENSES SEIL\u2019S EXCLUSIVE LICENSE WITH ECRENT TO UTILIZE  CERTAIN SOFTWARE AND TRADEMARKS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP, LAUNCH, OPERATE, COMMERCIALIZE, AND MAINTAIN AN ONLINE WEBSITE PLATFORM IN  SOUTH KOREA. IN RETURN, PTI SHALL PAY TO SEIL $230,000 (\u201cCONSIDERATION\u201d). THE LICENSE AGREEMENT WILL BE EFFECTIVE ON  SEPTEMBER 1, 2018 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019. IN ADDITION, IF THE AGGREGATE REVENUE DURING THE PERIOD EXCEEDS THE CONSIDERATION,  SEIL SHALL RECEIVE 30% OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AGGREGATE REVENUE AND THE CONSIDERATION. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018,  PTI COMMENCED PRELAUNCH ACTIVITIES TO DEVELOP THE PLATFORM.  EUROPE REGION.  IN AUGUST 2018, OUR SUBSIDIARY SEIL ENTERED  INTO A LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH ECRENT REGARDING THE GRANT OF AN EXCLUSIVE AND SUBLICENSABLE LICENSE FROM ECRENT TO SEII TO UTILIZE  CERTAIN SOFTWARE AND TRADEMARKS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP, LAUNCH, OPERATE, COMMERCIALIZE, AND MAINTAIN AN ONLINE WEBSITE PLATFORM IN  UNITED KINGDOM, GERMANY, FRANCE, POLAND, SWITZERLAND, NETHERLANDS, DENMARK, RUSSIA, ITALY, SPAIN, PORTUGAL AND GREECE. IN RETURN,  SEII SHALL ISSUE TO ECRENT 360,000 SHARES OF RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK. CLOSING OF THIS TRANSACTION WAS CONDITIONED ON VARIOUS CONDITIONS,  INCLUDING RECEIPT OF ALL NECESSARY REGULATORY APPROVALS. ON OCTOBER 9, 2018, THE AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED BY THE PARTIES, WHO HAVE  AGREED TO FOREGO THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS UNDER THE AGREEMENT.  GOING FORWARD,  WE WILL CONTINUE TARGETING THE TECHNOLOGY AND GLOBAL SHARING ECONOMY MARKETS, BY DEVELOPING ONLINE PLATFORMS AND RENTAL BUSINESS  PARTNERSHIPS THAT WILL DRIVE THE GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT OF SHARING THROUGH ECONOMICAL RENTAL BUSINESS MODELS.  INVENTORY AND  RAW MATERIALS  A MAJOR ELEMENT OF OUR COST OF REVENUES  IS RAW MATERIALS, PRINCIPALLY STEEL AS WELL AS OTHER METALS. THESE METALS ARE SUBJECT TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS, AND RECENTLY THESE  FLUCTUATIONS HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT. IN TIMES OF INCREASING PRICES, WE NEED TO TRY TO ESTABLISH THE PRICE AT WHICH WE PURCHASE RAW  MATERIALS IN ORDER TO AVOID INCREASES IN COSTS WHICH WE CANNOT RECOUP THROUGH INCREASES IN SALES PRICES. SIMILARLY, IN TIMES OF  DECREASING PRICES, WE MAY HAVE PURCHASED METALS AT PRICES WHICH ARE HIGH IN TERMS OF THE PRICE AT WHICH WE CAN SELL OUR PRODUCTS,  WHICH ALSO CAN IMPAIR OUR MARGINS. TWO MAJOR SUPPLIERS PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY 40% OF OUR PURCHASES OF INVENTORIES FOR THE NINE  MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. FOUR MAJOR SUPPLIERS PROVIDED 77% OF OUR PURCHASES OF INVENTORIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2018.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE  BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES  AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE  RELATED TO BAD DEBTS, INVENTORIES, RECOVERY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCOME TAXES AND THE VALUATION OF EQUITY TRANSACTIONS.  WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES  ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS  OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT  FROM OTHER SOURCES. ANY FUTURE CHANGES TO THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL CHANGE TO OUR REPORTED AMOUNTS  OF REVENUES, EXPENSES, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION  OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  24  VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES  PURSUANT TO ASC  TOPIC 810 AND RELATED SUBTOPICS RELATED TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (\u201cVIES\u201d). THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS REQUIRE  A VIE TO BE CONSOLIDATED BY A COMPANY IF THAT COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A MAJORITY OF THE RISK OF LOSS FOR THE VIE OR IS ENTITLED TO  RECEIVE A MAJORITY OF THE VIE\u2019S RESIDUAL RETURNS. VIES ARE THOSE ENTITIES IN WHICH WE, THROUGH CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS,  BEAR THE RISK OF, AND ENJOY THE REWARDS NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH OWNERSHIP OF THE ENTITY, AND THEREFORE WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY  OF THE ENTITY.  DYEING AND HEAVY  INDUSTRIES ARE CONSIDERED VIES, AND WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. ON NOVEMBER 13, 2007, WE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THE DYEING  PURSUANT TO WHICH WE SHALL RECEIVE 100% OF DYEING\u2019S NET INCOME. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE AGREEMENTS, DYEING SHALL PAY CONSULTING  FEES EQUAL TO 100% OF ITS NET INCOME TO OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, GREEN POWER, AND GREEN POWER SHALL SUPPLY THE TECHNOLOGY AND  ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES NEEDED TO SERVICE DYEING.  THE ACCOUNTS OF  THE DYEING AND HEAVY INDUSTRIES ARE CONSOLIDATED IN THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS A VIE, DYEING AND HEAVY INDUSTRIES\u2019S  SALES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR TOTAL SALES, ITS INCOME FROM OPERATIONS IS CONSOLIDATED WITH OURS, AND OUR NET INCOME INCLUDES ALL OF  THE HUAYANG COMPANIES\u2019 NET INCOME, AND THEIR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE  VIES DO NOT HAVE ANY NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST AND, ACCORDINGLY, WE DID NOT SUBTRACT ANY NET INCOME IN CALCULATING THE NET INCOME  ATTRIBUTABLE TO US. BECAUSE OF THE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, WE HAVE PECUNIARY INTEREST IN DYEING THAT REQUIRE CONSOLIDATION OF  THE DYEING\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  WE HAVE A POLICY  OF RESERVING FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR EXISTING ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE. WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN ALLOWANCE IS NECESSARY BASED ON AN ANALYSIS  OF PAST DUE ACCOUNTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY INDICATE THAT THE REALIZATION OF AN ACCOUNT MAY BE IN DOUBT. ACCOUNT BALANCES DEEMED  TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE ARE CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE AFTER ALL MEANS OF COLLECTION HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED AND THE POTENTIAL FOR RECOVERY  IS CONSIDERED REMOTE.  AS A BASIS FOR  ESTIMATING THE LIKELIHOOD OF COLLECTION HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, WE CONSIDER A NUMBER OF FACTORS WHEN DETERMINING RESERVES FOR UNCOLLECTABLE  ACCOUNTS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE USE A REASONABLY RELIABLE METHODOLOGY TO ESTIMATE THE COLLECTABILITY OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. WE  REVIEW OUR ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS ON AT LEAST A QUARTERLY BASIS. WE ALSO CONSIDER WHETHER THE HISTORICAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS  ARE COMPARABLE TO CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR OTHER PARTIES THAT WE HAVE BUSINESS  RELATIONS WITH WERE TO DETERIORATE, RESULTING IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES MAY BE  REQUIRED.  INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES, CONSISTING  OF RAW MATERIALS, WORK-IN-PROCESS AND FINISHED GOODS, ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE UTILIZING THE WEIGHTED  AVERAGE METHOD. AN ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED WHEN MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT CERTAIN INVENTORIES MAY NOT BE SALEABLE. IF INVENTORY  COSTS EXCEED EXPECTED MARKET VALUE DUE TO OBSOLESCENCE OR QUANTITIES IN EXCESS OF EXPECTED DEMAND, WE WILL RECORD ADDITIONAL RESERVES  FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND THE MARKET VALUE. THESE RESERVES ARE RECORDED BASED ON ESTIMATES. WE REVIEW INVENTORY QUANTITIES  ON HAND AND ON ORDER AND RECORD, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, A PROVISION FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY, IF NECESSARY. IF THE RESULTS  OF THE REVIEW DETERMINE THAT A WRITE-DOWN IS NECESSARY, WE RECOGNIZE A LOSS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE LOSS IS IDENTIFIED, WHETHER  OR NOT THE INVENTORY IS RETAINED. OUR INVENTORY RESERVES ESTABLISH A NEW COST BASIS FOR INVENTORY AND ARE NOT REVERSED UNTIL WE  SELL OR DISPOSE OF THE RELATED INVENTORY. SUCH PROVISIONS ARE ESTABLISHED BASED ON HISTORICAL USAGE, ADJUSTED FOR KNOWN CHANGES  IN DEMANDS FOR SUCH PRODUCTS, OR THE ESTIMATED FORECAST OF PRODUCT DEMAND AND PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS.  25  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST  LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED USING STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS.  THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  USEFUL LIFE  BUILDING AND BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS  5 \u2013 20 YEARS  MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT  5 \u2013 10 YEARS  OFFICE EQUIPMENT AND FURNITURE  5 YEARS  VEHICLES  5 YEARS  THE COST OF REPAIRS  AND MAINTENANCE IS EXPENSED AS INCURRED; MAJOR REPLACEMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED. WHEN ASSETS ARE RETIRED OR DISPOSED  OF, THE COST AND ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED FROM THE ACCOUNTS, AND ANY RESULTING GAINS OR LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN THE  STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE YEAR OF DISPOSITION.  WE EXAMINE THE  POSSIBILITY OF DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF FIXED ASSETS WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES REFLECT THE FACT THAT THEIR RECORDED  VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. WE RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS WHEN THE SUM OF EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS IS LESS THAN  THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IS ACCOUNTED FOR  BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TOPIC OF ASC 718 WHICH REQUIRES RECOGNITION IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF  THE COST OF EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR SERVICES RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN AWARD OF EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OVER THE VESTING PERIOD OR IMMEDIATELY  IF THE AWARD IS NON-FORFEITABLE. THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION ALSO REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF THE COST OF EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR  SERVICES RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR AN AWARD BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD.  ADDITIONALLY, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017,  THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2016-09 (\u201cASU 2016-09\u201d), IMPROVEMENTS TO EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED  PAYMENT ACCOUNTING. ASU 2016-09 PERMITS THE ELECTION OF AN ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR FORFEITURES OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS, EITHER  TO RECOGNIZE FORFEITURES AS THEY OCCUR OR ESTIMATE FORFEITURES OVER THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE AWARD. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO  RECOGNIZE FORFEITURES AS THEY OCCUR AND THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE DID NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.  THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, PURSUANT TO  ASC 505-50 \u2013 \u201cEQUITY-BASED PAYMENTS TO NON-EMPLOYEES\u201d, ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO NON-EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS  OF STOCK OPTIONS, WERE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE  CONSULTING ARRANGEMENT OR UNTIL PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE MET. THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REASSESSED THE FAIR VALUE  OF NON-EMPLOYEE SHARE BASED PAYMENTS UNTIL SERVICE CONDITIONS ARE MET, WHICH GENERALLY ALIGNS WITH THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE EQUITY  INSTRUMENT, AND THE COMPANY ADJUSTS THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ACCORDINGLY. IN JUNE 2018,  THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-07, IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING, WHICH SIMPLIFIES SEVERAL ASPECTS OF  THE ACCOUNTING FOR NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS BY EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION GUIDANCE  IN ASC 718 TO INCLUDE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS FOR ACQUIRING GOODS AND SERVICES FROM NON-EMPLOYEES. ASU NO. 2018-07 IS  EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE ANNUAL PERIODS. EARLY ADOPTION  IS PERMITTED, BUT ENTITIES MAY NOT ADOPT PRIOR TO ADOPTING THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE IN ASC 606. THE COMPANY EARLY ADOPTED  ASU NO. 2018-07 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND THERE WAS NO CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ADOPTION.  26  CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES  OUR FUNCTIONAL  CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR, AND THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF OUR OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES AND VIES IS THE RMB AND HONG KONG DOLLAR.  SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SALES ARE DENOMINATED IN RMB. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUES OF U.S. DOLLARS AND RMB AFFECT  OUR REPORTED LEVELS OF REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY AS THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR REPORTING  PURPOSES. IN PARTICULAR, FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STABILITY DUE  TO A MISMATCH AMONG VARIOUS FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SALES AND COSTS. FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR  AND RMB AFFECT OUR GROSS AND NET PROFIT MARGINS AND COULD RESULT IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND OPERATING LOSSES.  OUR EXPOSURE TO  FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK PRIMARILY RELATES TO CURRENCY GAINS OR LOSSES RESULTING FROM TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SIGNING OF SALES  CONTRACTS AND SETTLING OF THESE CONTRACTS. FURTHERMORE, WE TRANSLATE MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN OTHER CURRENCIES  INTO RMB, THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF OUR OPERATING SUBSIDIARY. OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE  EXCHANGE RATES DURING THE PERIOD, AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE TRANSLATED AT THE UNIFIED EXCHANGE RATE AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.  TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM THIS PROCESS ARE INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN OUR STATEMENT OF  SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. WE HAVE NOT USED ANY FORWARD CONTRACTS, CURRENCY OPTIONS OR BORROWINGS TO HEDGE OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN  CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT OF FUTURE EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND MAY  INCUR NET FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.  OUR FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS ARE EXPRESSED IN U.S. DOLLARS, WHICH IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF OUR PARENT COMPANY. THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF OUR  OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES IS RMB AND THE HONG KONG DOLLAR. TO THE EXTENT WE HOLD ASSETS DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS,  ANY APPRECIATION OF THE RMB OR HKD AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR COULD RESULT IN A CHARGE IN OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND A REDUCTION  IN THE VALUE OF OUR U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED ASSETS. ON THE OTHER HAND, A DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF RMB OR HKD AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR  COULD REDUCE THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT AMOUNTS OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-02,  \u201cLEASES (TOPIC 842)\u201d. UNDER ASU 2016-02, LESSEES WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE ALL LEASES (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SHORT-TERM  LEASES) AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE INCLUDING A LEASE LIABILITY, WHICH IS A LESSEE\u2019S OBLIGATION TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS ARISING  FROM A LEASE, MEASURED ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS; AND A RIGHT-OF-USE (ROU) ASSET, WHICH IS AN ASSET THAT REPRESENTS THE LESSEE\u2019S  RIGHT TO USE, OR CONTROL THE USE OF, A SPECIFIED ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM. LEASES WITH A TERM OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS WILL BE  ACCOUNTED FOR SIMILAR TO EXISTING GUIDANCE FOR OPERATING LEASES. IN DECEMBER 2017, JANUARY 2018, JULY 2018, DECEMBER 2018 AND MARCH  2019, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-13, ASU 2018-01, ASU 2018-10 & 11, ASU 2018-20 AND ASU 2019-01, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH CONTAIN  MODIFICATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO ASU 2016-02. THE AMENDMENTS PROVIDE ENTITIES WITH AN ADDITIONAL (AND OPTIONAL) TRANSITION METHOD  TO ADOPT THE NEW LEASES STANDARD. UNDER THE OPTIONAL TRANSITION METHOD, AN ENTITY INITIALLY APPLIES THE NEW LEASES STANDARD AT  THE ADOPTION DATE AND RECOGNIZES A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION.  ON JANUARY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASC TOPIC 842 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH AND ELECTED TO UTILIZE THE OPTIONAL  TRANSITION METHOD. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ELECTED THE LAND EASEMENT TRANSITION PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT AND DID NOT REASSESS WHETHER  AN EXISTING OR EXPIRED LAND EASEMENT IS A LEASE OR CONTAINS A LEASE IF IT HAS NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR AS A LEASE. THE  ADOPTION DID NOT IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S PREVIOUSLY REPORTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOR DID IT RESULT IN A CUMULATIVE  EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-07,  COMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT. ASU 2018-07 ALIGNS THE ACCOUNTING  FOR SHARE BASED PAYMENTS GRANTED TO NON-EMPLOYEES WITH THAT OF SHARE BASED PAYMENTS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY EARLY ADOPTED  ASU NO. 2018-07 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND THERE WAS NO CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ADOPTION.

FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF DYEING AND FINISHING EQUIPMENT DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $840,000, OR 33.4%,  AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, REVENUES FROM THE SALE  OF DYEING AND FINISHING EQUIPMENT DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $2,411,000, OR 31.5%, AS COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2018. WE EXPERIENCED AN ANTICIPATED SLOWDOWN IN SALES OF OUR LOW-EMISSION AIRFLOW DYEING MACHINES AS MANY CUSTOMERS HAD REPLACED  OLDER DYEING EQUIPMENT WITH OUR LOW-EMISSION AIRFLOW DYEING MACHINE, AND WE BELIEVE THAT ORDERS FOR NEW LOW-EMISSION AIRFLOW DYEING  MACHINES HAVE SLOWED DOWN IN 2018 AND 2017 BECAUSE THE REMAINING POTENTIAL CUSTOMER BASE INCLUDED MANY COMPANIES THAT DID NOT HAVE  THE ABILITY TO MAKE THE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES NECESSARY TO UPGRADE THEIR EQUIPMENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY  IN CHINA HAS BEEN FACING SIGNIFICANT HEADWINDS RECENTLY. DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, A CONTINUING DECLINE IN OIL PRICES AND  LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT IN CHINA, PRESENTED NUMEROUS CHALLENGES FOR OUR DYEING MACHINE BUSINESS. ADDITIONALLY, APPAREL FACTORIES  AND OTHER FACTORIES HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN THROUGHOUT THE LAST YEAR BY CHINA\u2019S ENVIRONMENTAL BUREAU, WHICH HAS BEEN CUTTING  ELECTRICITY AND GAS SUPPLY TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH CHINA\u2019S ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR REVENUES DECREASED IN  THE 2019 PERIOD AS COMPARED TO THE 2018 PERIOD. WE EXPECT THAT OUR REVENUES FROM DYEING AND FINISHING EQUIPMENT SEGMENT WILL REMAIN  AT OR ABOUT ITS CURRENT LEVEL IN THE NEAR FUTURE, ALTHOUGH DECLINES ARE POSSIBLE.  DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE RECOGNIZED REVENUES FROM OUR SHARING ECONOMY BUSINESS OF $533 AND $27,325 COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $73,000  AND $156,000 FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  28  COST OF REVENUES.

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES  CONSOLIDATED SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES WERE $1,227,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO $1,048,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, AN INCREASE OF $179,000 OR 17%.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  CONSOLIDATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE $1,758,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $2,560,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, A DECREASE OF $802,000 OR 31%. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE DEVICE SEGMENT DECREASED BY $547,000 AND THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT SEGMENT DECREASED BY $255,000. THE DECREASE IN BOTH SEGMENTS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN PERSONNEL COSTS RELATED TO THE JUNE 2018 REORGANIZATION.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  CONSOLIDATED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE $3,617,000, COMPARED TO $6,256,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, A DECREASE OF $2,639,000 OR 42%. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY THE DECLINE IN PERSONNEL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE JUNE 2018 REORGANIZATION AND OTHER HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $750,000, SEVERANCE EXPENSES OF $250,000, A ONE-TIME LEGAL SETTLEMENT OF $150,000 AND A LOSS ON THE DISPOSAL OF FIXED ASSETS OF $420,000 IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE REMAINDER OF THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO A REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY $270,000 AS THE RESULT OF THE COMPANY ELIMINATING THE MANAGEMENT BONUS PLAN IN 2019, REDUCED LEGAL EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $100,000 IN THE CURRENT YEAR, REDUCED TRAVEL EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $100,000 IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND BAD DEBT EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $60,000 IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO ONE INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMER. ADDITIONALLY, INDIA GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE APPROXIMATELY $110,000 LESS IN THE CURRENT YEAR, DUE TO PAYROLL EXPENSES IN FROM A REORGANIZATION THERE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND SETTLEMENT OF AN OUTSTANDING DEBT.  IMPAIRMENT CHARGES  THE COMPANY INCURRED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $0 DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $27,202,000 DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT AND SUSTAINED DECLINE IN ITS STOCK PRICE RESULTING IN ITS MARKET CAPITALIZATION FALLING SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE RECORDED VALUE OF ITS CONSOLIDATED ASSETS. THE COMPANY PERFORMED A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT WHICH DETERMINED THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATING TO THE CLINICAL PROTOCOLS EXCEEDED ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. AS A RESULT, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $12,695,000 TO GOODWILL AND $14,507,000 TO THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE RECORDED DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 TO THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT SEGMENT.

THE INCREASE IS DRIVEN BY INTEREST RECORDED AND THE AMORTIZATION OF THE DEBT DISCOUNT AND INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE JANUARY 2019 NOTE AND AMENDED NOTE OF APPROXIMATELY $1,650,000, AS WELL AS APPROXIMATELY $1,200,000 MORE IN INTEREST AND AMORTIZATION OF THE DEBT DISCOUNT ON THE BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE RELATED TO THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH BOYALIFE, FOR WHICH AMORTIZATION STARTED IN MAY 2018 AND JULY 2019 NOTE INTEREST OF $46,000.  24  LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT  THE COMPANY RECORDED A LOSS OF EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF $840,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $0 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

BENEFIT FOR INCOME TAXES  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAS NO INCOME TAX BENEFIT COMPARED TO $3,451,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE BENEFIT FOR INCOME TAX FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 WAS DUE TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF THE INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE CLINICAL PROTOCOLS AND GOODWILL. THE COMPANY\u2019S DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY IS TIED TO THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $2,800,000 AND WORKING CAPITAL OF $5,435,000.  THIS COMPARES TO CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $2,400,000 AND WORKING CAPITAL OF $2,261,000 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018.  WE HAVE PRIMARILY FINANCED OPERATIONS THROUGH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PLACEMENT OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND OUR LINE OF CREDIT FACILITY.  THE COMPANY HAS A REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH BOYALIFE ASSET HOLDING II, INC. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD DRAWN DOWN $8,713,000 OF THE $10,000,000 AVAILABLE UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. FUTURE DRAW-DOWNS MAY BE LIMITED FOR VARIOUS REASONS INCLUDING DEFAULT OR FOREIGN GOVERNMENT POLICIES THAT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT TRANSFERRING FUNDS. AT THE TIME OF THIS FILING, WE ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO DRAW DOWN ON THE LINE OF CREDIT. THIS MAY CHANGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE LINE OF CREDIT WILL BECOME AVAILABLE AT SUCH TIME WHEN IT IS NEEDED. BOYALIFE ASSET HOLDING II, INC. IS A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF BOYALIFE GROUP INC., WHICH IS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY THE COMPANY\u2019S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD.  THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED RECURRING OPERATING LOSSES AND AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $232,885,000. THESE CONDITIONS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE ISSUANCE DATE. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES REQUIRING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO GROW THE BUSINESS, TO FUND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES AND TO MAKE INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE LINE OF CREDIT WITH BOYALIFE.  THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO FUND ITS CASH NEEDS IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL. THE COMPANY MAY SEEK ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH BANK BORROWINGS OR PUBLIC OR PRIVATE SALES OF DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES OR STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS. THE COMPANY CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT SUCH FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE ON A TIMELY BASIS, IN NEEDED QUANTITIES OR ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US, IF AT ALL.  NON-GAAP MEASURES  IN ADDITION TO THE RESULTS REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH US GAAP, WE ALSO USE A NON-GAAP MEASURE, ADJUSTED EBITDA, TO EVALUATE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND TO FACILITATE THE COMPARISON OF OUR HISTORICAL RESULTS AND TRENDS. THE COMPANY CALCULATES ADJUSTED EBITDA AS INCOME FROM OPERATIONS LESS DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, STOCK COMPENSATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER US GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR LOSS AS A MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE. THE CALCULATION OF THIS NON-GAAP MEASURE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. RECONCILIATIONS TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE ARE PROVIDED BELOW.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.

OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD HAS INCREASED BECAUSE OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS SUCH AS HIGHER FREIGHT AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS (INCLUDING THOSE DUE TO INEFFICIENCIES OR DISRUPTIONS), HIGHER SALES MIX OF LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS AND HIGHER SHRINK.

IT WILL TAKE OUR NEW PERSONNEL SOME TIME TO GAIN THE EXPERIENCE OF THEIR PREDECESSORS.  \u2022  OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE FAIL TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED ASSOCIATES AND KEY PERSONNEL. THIS IS MORE DIFFICULT IN AN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT OF LOW UNEMPLOYMENT AND HIGHER WAGES.  \u2022  WE RELY ON COMPUTER AND TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS IN OUR OPERATIONS, AND ANY MATERIAL FAILURE, INADEQUACY, INTERRUPTION OR SECURITY FAILURE OF THOSE SYSTEMS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY OPERATE AND GROW OUR BUSINESS AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  \u2022  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SECURE OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 CREDIT CARD AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR OTHER PRIVATE DATA RELATING TO OUR ASSOCIATES, SUPPLIERS OR OUR BUSINESS, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO NEGATIVE PUBLICITY, COSTLY GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OR PRIVATE LITIGATION AND INCREASED COSTS, WHICH COULD DAMAGE OUR BUSINESS REPUTATION AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR BUSINESS.  \u2022  OUR GROWTH IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE SALES IN EXISTING STORES AND TO EXPAND OUR SQUARE FOOTAGE PROFITABLY.  \u2022  WE COULD INCUR LOSSES DUE TO IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  \u2022  LITIGATION, ARBITRATIONS AND OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE DO NOT UNDERTAKE TO PUBLICLY UPDATE OR REVISE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AFTER THE DATE OF THIS FORM 10-Q, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS, OR OTHERWISE.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING OPERATOR OF MORE THAN  15,200  RETAIL DISCOUNT STORES AND WE CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS IN TWO REPORTING SEGMENTS. OUR DOLLAR TREE SEGMENT IS THE LEADING OPERATOR OF DISCOUNT VARIETY STORES OFFERING MERCHANDISE AT THE FIXED PRICE OF  $1.00  . OUR FAMILY DOLLAR SEGMENT OPERATES GENERAL MERCHANDISE RETAIL DISCOUNT STORES PROVIDING CONSUMERS WITH A SELECTION OF COMPETITIVELY-PRICED MERCHANDISE IN CONVENIENT NEIGHBORHOOD STORES.  OUR NET SALES ARE DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF MERCHANDISE. TWO MAJOR FACTORS TEND TO AFFECT OUR NET SALES TRENDS. FIRST IS OUR SUCCESS AT OPENING NEW STORES OR ADDING NEW STORES THROUGH MERGERS OR ACQUISITIONS. SECOND IS THE PERFORMANCE OF STORES ONCE THEY ARE OPEN. SALES VARY AT OUR EXISTING STORES FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT. WE REFER TO THIS AS A CHANGE IN COMPARABLE STORE NET SALES, BECAUSE WE INCLUDE ONLY THOSE STORES THAT ARE OPEN THROUGHOUT BOTH OF THE PERIODS BEING COMPARED, BEGINNING AFTER THE FIRST FIFTEEN MONTHS OF OPERATION. WE INCLUDE SALES FROM STORES EXPANDED OR REMODELED DURING THE PERIOD IN THE CALCULATION OF COMPARABLE STORE NET SALES, WHICH HAS THE EFFECT OF INCREASING OUR COMPARABLE STORE NET SALES. THE TERM \u2018EXPANDED\u2019 ALSO INCLUDES STORES THAT ARE RELOCATED. STORES THAT HAVE BEEN RE-BANNERED ARE CONSIDERED TO BE NEW STORES AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION OF THE COMPARABLE STORE NET SALES CHANGE UNTIL AFTER THE FIRST FIFTEEN MONTHS OF OPERATION UNDER THE NEW BRAND.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AT  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , WE OPERATED STORES IN  48  STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, AS WELL AS STORES IN  FIVE  CANADIAN PROVINCES.

COMPARABLE STORE NET SALES FOR DOLLAR TREE MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED WHEN A FAMILY DOLLAR STORE IS RE-BANNERED NEAR AN EXISTING DOLLAR TREE STORE.  THE AVERAGE SIZE OF STORES OPENED DURING THE  39 WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  WAS APPROXIMATELY  8,570  SELLING SQUARE FEET FOR THE DOLLAR TREE SEGMENT AND  7,710  SELLING SQUARE FEET FOR THE FAMILY DOLLAR SEGMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE SIZE STORES ARE IN THE RANGES OF OUR OPTIMAL SIZES OPERATIONALLY AND GIVE OUR CUSTOMERS A SHOPPING ENVIRONMENT WHICH INVITES THEM TO SHOP LONGER, BUY MORE AND MAKE RETURN VISITS.  FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARABLE STORE NET SALES INCREASED  2.5%  ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS. CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS REFERS TO THE CALCULATION EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. WE CALCULATED THE CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS INCREASE BY TRANSLATING THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER\u2019S COMPARABLE STORE NET SALES IN CANADA USING THE PRIOR YEAR THIRD QUARTER\u2019S CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS PROVIDES A MORE ACCURATE MEASURE OF COMPARABLE STORE NET SALES PERFORMANCE. INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CANADIAN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, COMPARABLE STORE NET SALES INCREASED THE SAME  2.5%  DUE TO INCREASES IN AVERAGE TICKET AND CUSTOMER COUNT. ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, COMPARABLE STORE NET SALES INCREASED  2.8%  IN THE DOLLAR TREE SEGMENT AND INCREASED  2.3%  IN THE FAMILY DOLLAR SEGMENT FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  . INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY, COMPARABLE STORE NET SALES IN THE DOLLAR TREE SEGMENT INCREASED THE SAME  2.8%  . COMPARABLE STORE NET SALES ARE POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY OUR EXPANDED AND RELOCATED STORES, WHICH WE INCLUDE IN THE CALCULATION, AND ARE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED WHEN WE OPEN NEW STORES, RE-BANNER STORES OR EXPAND STORES NEAR EXISTING STORES.  WE BELIEVE COMPARABLE STORE NET SALES CONTINUE TO BE POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF OUR DOLLAR TREE INITIATIVES. WE CONTINUED THE ROLL-OUT OF FROZEN AND REFRIGERATED MERCHANDISE TO MORE OF OUR DOLLAR TREE STORES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , THE DOLLAR TREE SEGMENT HAD FROZEN AND REFRIGERATED MERCHANDISE IN APPROXIMATELY  6,100  STORES COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY  5,580  STORES AT  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  . OVER THE PAST YEAR, WE ROLLED OUT A NEW LAYOUT TO A NUMBER OF OUR DOLLAR TREE STORES, WHICH WE CALL OUR SNACK ZONE. THIS LAYOUT HIGHLIGHTS OUR IMMEDIATE CONSUMPTION SNACK OFFERINGS IN THE FRONT OF THE STORE NEAR THE CHECKOUT AREAS. AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , WE HAVE THIS LAYOUT IN APPROXIMATELY 2,090 DOLLAR TREE STORES. WE BELIEVE THESE INITIATIVES HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO ENABLE US TO INCREASE SALES AND EARNINGS BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SHOPPING TRIPS MADE BY OUR CUSTOMERS.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS ANNOUNCED IN MARCH 2019, WE ARE CURRENTLY EXECUTING A STORE OPTIMIZATION PROGRAM FOR OUR FAMILY DOLLAR STORES TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE. THIS PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  A ROLL-OUT OF A NEW MODEL FOR BOTH NEW AND RENOVATED FAMILY DOLLAR STORES INTERNALLY KNOWN AS H2. WE TESTED THE H2 MODEL IN 2018 ON A LIMITED BASIS WITH POSITIVE RESULTS. THIS H2 MODEL HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED MERCHANDISE OFFERINGS, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY 20 DOLLAR TREE $1.00 MERCHANDISE SECTIONS AND ESTABLISHING A MINIMUM NUMBER OF FREEZER AND COOLER DOORS, THROUGHOUT THE STORE. H2 HAS INCREASED TRAFFIC AND PROVIDED AN AVERAGE COMPARABLE STORE NET SALES LIFT IN EXCESS OF 10% OVER CONTROL STORES. H2 PERFORMS WELL IN A VARIETY OF LOCATIONS AND ESPECIALLY IN LOCATIONS WHERE FAMILY DOLLAR HAS BEEN MOST CHALLENGED IN THE PAST. WE STARTED 2019 WITH APPROXIMATELY 200 H2 STORES AND AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY 1,460 H2 STORES.  \u2022  WE PLAN TO CLOSE UNDER-PERFORMING STORES. THE NORMAL CADENCE OF FAMILY DOLLAR CLOSINGS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IS APPROXIMATELY 75 STORES. IN 2019 WE PLAN TO CLOSE APPROXIMATELY 420 STORES AND HAVE CLOSED 342 STORES AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  . WE EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $25.8 MILLION IN STORE CLOSURE COSTS AND THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE HAVE INCURRED $21.3 MILLION. IN ADDITION TO THESE COSTS, DURING 2019 WE EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $17.0 MILLION OF OTHER STORE CLOSURE COSTS, PRIMARILY IN CONNECTION WITH THE DISPOSAL OF FIXED ASSETS, OF WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL HAS BEEN INCURRED THROUGH NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  \u2022  WE PLAN TO RE-BANNER AS MANY AS 200 FAMILY DOLLAR STORES TO THE DOLLAR TREE BRAND IN 2019. AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , WE HAVE RE-BANNERED 190 STORES TO THE DOLLAR TREE BRAND.  \u2022  ADDITIONALLY, WE PLAN TO INSTALL ADULT BEVERAGE PRODUCT IN APPROXIMATELY 500 STORES AND CONTINUE TO PLAN TO EXPAND FREEZERS AND COOLERS IN APPROXIMATELY 75 STORES IN 2019. AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , WE INSTALLED ADULT BEVERAGE PRODUCT IN APPROXIMATELY 345 STORES AND EXPANDED FREEZERS AND COOLERS IN APPROXIMATELY 70 STORES.  IN FISCAL 2019, IN ADDITION TO THE APPROXIMATELY $42.8 MILLION IN STORE CLOSURE COSTS, WE EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $28.0 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL INITIATIVE COSTS BASED ON PROJECT COUNT AND VELOCITY, OF WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL HAS BEEN INCURRED THROUGH NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  AS PART OF OUR CONTINUING INTEGRATION OF FAMILY DOLLAR\u2019S ORGANIZATION AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, IN 2019 WE CONSOLIDATED OUR STORE SUPPORT CENTERS IN MATTHEWS, NORTH CAROLINA AND CHESAPEAKE, VIRGINIA TO OUR DEVELOPMENT IN CHESAPEAKE, VIRGINIA. APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT OF THE MATTHEWS ASSOCIATES, INCLUDING MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OF THE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS, INVITED TO MOVE TO CHESAPEAKE AGREED TO DO SO. WE EXPECT THE CONSOLIDATION TO BE COMPLETE IN 2019 AND WE EXPECT TO INCUR PRE-TAX EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $29.0 MILLION IN 2019 IN CONNECTION WITH THESE PLANS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $24.5 MILLION WAS INCURRED THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019.  ADDITIONALLY, THE FOLLOWING ITEMS HAVE ALREADY IMPACTED OR COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DURING 2019 OR IN THE FUTURE.  \u2022  THE OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES TRADE REPRESENTATIVE (USTR) PREVIOUSLY IMPOSED TARIFFS UNDER SECTION 301 AGAINST CHINESE GOODS DESCRIBED ON LISTS 1, 2, AND 3 WITH AN ANNUAL TRADE VALUE OF $250 BILLION. WHEN THE TARIFFS WERE IMPLEMENTED, APPROXIMATELY NINE PERCENT OF OUR PRODUCTS, MEASURED BY SALES VOLUME, WERE ON LISTS 1, 2, AND 3. TO MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECT OF THE TARIFFS, WE NEGOTIATED PRICE CONCESSIONS FROM VENDORS ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS, CANCELED ORDERS, CHANGED PRODUCT SIZES AND SPECIFICATIONS, CHANGED OUR PRODUCT MIX AND CHANGED VENDORS. AS A RESULT OF OUR MITIGATION EFFORTS, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE REDUCED MOST OF THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE TARIFFS UNDER LISTS 1, 2, AND 3 ON THE DOLLAR TREE AND FAMILY DOLLAR SEGMENTS THROUGH JANUARY 2020.  \u2022  EARLIER THIS YEAR, THE USTR BEGAN A PROCESS TO IMPOSE A TARIFF ON ALL OF THE $300 BILLION IN CHINESE GOODS WHICH WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY SUBJECT TO A TARIFF UNDER SECTION 301, REFERRED TO AS LIST 4 GOODS. THE USTR PUBLISHED THE FINAL DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS ON LIST 4 AND DIVIDED THE LIST INTO TWO PARTS. TARIFFS AT THE RATE OF 15 PERCENT ON LIST 4A GOODS WENT INTO EFFECT SEPTEMBER 1, 2019. TARIFFS AT THE RATE OF 15 PERCENT ON LIST 4B GOODS ARE SCHEDULED TO GO INTO EFFECT DECEMBER 15, 2019. WE ANTICIPATE THAT MORE OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE ON LIST 4 THAN LISTS 1, 2, AND 3 COMBINED. HOWEVER, WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT MOST OF OUR LIST 4 PRODUCTS ARE CONTAINED ON LIST 4B AND NOT LIST 4A.  \u2022  WE ESTIMATE THAT SECTION 301 TARIFFS WILL INCREASE OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD BY APPROXIMATELY $19.0 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 IF THEY ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED AS NOW SCHEDULED. ALMOST ALL OF THIS COST IS DUE TO LIST 4A BECAUSE ITS TIMING DID NOT ALLOW FOR SIGNIFICANT MITIGATION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE FUTURE IMPACT OF THOSE TARIFFS. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THAT IMPACT OF MITIGATION UNTIL WE CAN ESTIMATE THE SUCCESS OF OUR CURRENT EFFORTS. WE CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCES AS TO THE FINAL SCOPE, DURATION, OR IMPACT OF ANY EXISTING OR FUTURE TARIFFS. THE TARIFFS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NEXT YEAR.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  WE ANTICIPATE HIGHER IMPORT FREIGHT COSTS CONTINUING INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 AND BEYOND BASED ON OUR APRIL 2019 RATE NEGOTIATIONS, AND BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2020 BASED ON THE COMMENCEMENT OF LOW SULPHUR FUEL REQUIREMENTS FOR SHIPS. WE EXPECT THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN HIGHER COSTS IN FUTURE PERIODS AS MERCHANDISE IS SOLD.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  13 WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  COMPARED TO THE 13 WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NET SALES.  NET SALES INCREASED $207.4 MILLION, OR 3.7%, COMPARED WITH LAST YEAR\u2019S THIRD QUARTER, RESULTING FROM INCREASES IN COMPARABLE STORE NET SALES IN THE DOLLAR TREE AND FAMILY DOLLAR SEGMENTS AND SALES OF $217.5 MILLION IN NEW STORES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOST SALES RESULTING FROM STORE CLOSURES PRIMARILY ON THE FAMILY DOLLAR SEGMENT.

OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED IN  TWO  REPORTING BUSINESS SEGMENTS: DOLLAR TREE AND FAMILY DOLLAR. WE DEFINE OUR SEGMENTS AS THOSE OPERATIONS WHOSE RESULTS OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (\u201cCODM\u201d) REGULARLY REVIEWS TO ANALYZE PERFORMANCE AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES.  THE DOLLAR TREE SEGMENT IS THE LEADING OPERATOR OF DISCOUNT VARIETY STORES OFFERING MERCHANDISE AT THE FIXED PRICE OF  $1.00  . THE DOLLAR TREE SEGMENT INCLUDES OUR OPERATIONS UNDER THE \u201cDOLLAR TREE\u201d AND \u201cDOLLAR TREE CANADA\u201d BRANDS,  13  DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND  TWO  DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN CANADA. BECAUSE OF OUR CANADIAN OPERATIONS, WE REPORT COMPARABLE STORE NET SALES ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS.  THE FAMILY DOLLAR SEGMENT OPERATES A CHAIN OF GENERAL MERCHANDISE RETAIL DISCOUNT STORES PROVIDING CONSUMERS WITH A SELECTION OF COMPETITIVELY-PRICED MERCHANDISE IN CONVENIENT NEIGHBORHOOD STORES. THE FAMILY DOLLAR SEGMENT CONSISTS OF OUR OPERATIONS UNDER THE \u201cFAMILY DOLLAR\u201d BRAND AND  11  DISTRIBUTION CENTERS.  WE MEASURE THE RESULTS OF OUR SEGMENTS USING, AMONG OTHER MEASURES, EACH SEGMENT\u2019S NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT AND OPERATING INCOME. THE CODM REVIEWS THESE METRICS FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING SEGMENTS.WE MAY REVISE THE MEASUREMENT OF EACH SEGMENT\u2019S OPERATING INCOME, AS DETERMINED BY THE INFORMATION REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CODM. IF THE MEASUREMENT OF A SEGMENT CHANGES, PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS AND BALANCES ARE RECLASSIFIED TO BE COMPARABLE TO THE CURRENT PERIOD\u2019S PRESENTATION. IN THE CURRENT YEAR, WE IDENTIFIED CORPORATE AND SUPPORT COSTS, MAINLY STORE SUPPORT CENTER COSTS THAT ARE CONSIDERED SHARED SERVICES, AND EXCLUDED THESE SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FROM OUR TWO REPORTING BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THESE COSTS INCLUDE OPERATING EXPENSES FOR OUR STORE SUPPORT CENTERS IN CHESAPEAKE, VIRGINIA AND MATTHEWS, NORTH CAROLINA.

COMPARABLE SALES IS A MEASURE THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR STORES AND DIGITAL CHANNELS BY MEASURING THE CHANGE IN SALES FOR A PERIOD OVER THE COMPARABLE, PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD OF EQUIVALENT LENGTH. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDE ALL SALES, EXCEPT SALES FROM STORES OPEN LESS THAN 13 MONTHS, DIGITAL ACQUISITIONS WE HAVE OWNED LESS THAN 13 MONTHS, STORES THAT HAVE BEEN CLOSED, AND DIGITAL ACQUISITIONS THAT WE NO LONGER OPERATE. COMPARABLE SALES MEASURES VARY ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, OUR COMPARABLE SALES CALCULATION IS NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. DIGITALLY ORIGINATED SALES INCLUDE ALL SALES INITIATED THROUGH MOBILE APPLICATIONS AND OUR WEBSITES. OUR STORES FULFILL THE MAJORITY OF DIGITALLY ORIGINATED SALES, INCLUDING SHIPMENT FROM STORES TO GUESTS, STORE PICK-UP OR DRIVE-UP, AND DELIVERY VIA OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, SHIPT. DIGITALLY ORIGINATED SALES MAY ALSO BE FULFILLED THROUGH OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, OUR VENDORS, OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES.

THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO MERCHANDISING EFFORTS TO OPTIMIZE COSTS, PRICING, PROMOTIONS, AND ASSORTMENT, COMBINED WITH FAVORABLE CATEGORY SALES MIX. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, AGGREGATE SUPPLY CHAIN AND DIGITAL FULFILLMENT  COSTS HAD AN INSIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN RATE RELATIVE TO THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , OUR GROSS MARGIN RATE WAS  30.0 PERCENT  COMPARED WITH  29.6 PERCENT  IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO MERCHANDISING EFFORTS TO OPTIMIZE COSTS, PRICING, PROMOTIONS, AND ASSORTMENT, AND FAVORABLE CATEGORY SALES MIX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SUPPLY CHAIN AND DIGITAL FULFILLMENT COSTS.  14  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE RATE  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , OUR SG&A EXPENSE RATE WAS  22.3 PERCENT  COMPARED WITH  22.1 PERCENT  IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER COMPENSATION COSTS, INCLUDING STORE WAGES, AND MARKETING EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BROAD-BASED COST SAVINGS.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , OUR SG&A EXPENSE RATE WAS  21.4 PERCENT  COMPARED WITH  21.7 PERCENT  IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR.

THESE MEASURES ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH, OR AN ALTERNATIVE TO, GAAP. THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE IS NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. EBIT AND EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTION FOR ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP. OTHER COMPANIES MAY CALCULATE EBIT AND EBITDA DIFFERENTLY, LIMITING THE USEFULNESS OF THE MEASURE FOR COMPARISONS WITH OTHER COMPANIES.

FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , AND  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , INCLUDES TAX EFFECT OF  $1,024 MILLION  AND  $514 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO EBIT, AND  $19 MILLION  AND  $10 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO OPERATING LEASE INTEREST.  (D)  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , AND  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , INCLUDES DISCRETE TAX ITEMS OF $(3) MILLION AND $382 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THE TAX ACT.

OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE INCLUDES SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF  $163 MILLION  ,  $769 MILLION  , AND  $42 MILLION  AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  ,  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , AND  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR INVESTMENT POLICY IS DESIGNED TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL AND LIQUIDITY OF OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. THIS POLICY ALLOWS INVESTMENTS IN LARGE MONEY MARKET FUNDS OR IN HIGHLY RATED DIRECT SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS THAT MATURE IN 60 DAYS OR LESS. WE ALSO PLACE DOLLAR LIMITS ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL FUNDS OR INSTRUMENTS.  CAPITAL ALLOCATION  WE FOLLOW A DISCIPLINED AND BALANCED APPROACH TO CAPITAL ALLOCATION BASED ON THE FOLLOWING PRIORITIES, RANKED IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE: FIRST, WE FULLY INVEST IN OPPORTUNITIES TO PROFITABLY GROW OUR BUSINESS, CREATE SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM VALUE, AND MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS AND ASSETS; SECOND, WE MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AND SEEK TO GROW IT ANNUALLY; AND FINALLY, WE RETURN ANY EXCESS CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS BY REPURCHASING SHARES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF OUR CREDIT RATING GOALS.  WE EXPECT 2019 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $3.1 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $3.5 BILLION IN 2018.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS  OPERATING CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY CONTINUING OPERATIONS WAS  $4,141 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  $3,614 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  . THE OPERATING CASH FLOW INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET EARNINGS DURING THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  INVENTORY  INVENTORY WAS  $11,396 MILLION  AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  $9,497 MILLION  AND  $12,393 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , AND  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE FROM  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , REFLECTS THE SEASONAL INVENTORY BUILD AHEAD OF THE NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER HOLIDAY SALES PERIOD. INVENTORY LEVELS WERE LOWER AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, COMPARED WITH NOVEMBER 3, 2018, PARTIALLY DUE TO TIMING OF RECEIPTS BECAUSE THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY IS LATER IN THE CURRENT YEAR. IN ADDITION, ELEVATED INVENTORY LEVELS IN THE PRIOR YEAR REFLECTED INVESTMENTS IN TOYS AND BABY-RELATED MERCHANDISE.  DIVIDENDS  WE PAID DIVIDENDS TOTALING  $337 MILLION  (  $0.66  PER SHARE) AND  $995 MILLION  (  $1.94  PER SHARE) FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  $337 MILLION  (  $0.64  PER SHARE) AND  $1,001 MILLION  (  $1.88  PER SHARE) FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, A PER SHARE INCREASE OF  3.1  PERCENT AND 3.2 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY. WE DECLARED DIVIDENDS TOTALING  $338 MILLION  (  $0.66  PER SHARE) DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  , A PER SHARE INCREASE OF  3.1  PERCENT OVER THE  $338 MILLION  (  $0.64  PER SHARE) OF DECLARED DIVIDENDS DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2018  . WE HAVE PAID DIVIDENDS EVERY QUARTER SINCE OUR 1967 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING, AND IT IS OUR INTENT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE.  SHARE REPURCHASE  WE RETURNED  $294 MILLION  AND $912 MILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASE DURING THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. SEE PART II, ITEM 2 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION.  20  FINANCING  OUR FINANCING STRATEGY IS TO ENSURE LIQUIDITY AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, TO MAINTAIN A BALANCED SPECTRUM OF DEBT MATURITIES, AND TO MANAGE OUR NET EXPOSURE TO FLOATING INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY. WITHIN THESE PARAMETERS, WE SEEK TO MINIMIZE OUR BORROWING COSTS. OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE LONG-TERM DEBT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS HAS PROVIDED US WITH AMPLE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. OUR CONTINUED ACCESS TO THESE MARKETS DEPENDS ON MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING THE CONDITION OF DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND MAINTAINING STRONG CREDIT RATINGS. AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , OUR CREDIT RATINGS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  CREDIT RATINGS  MOODY\u2019S  STANDARD AND POOR\u2019S  FITCH  LONG-TERM DEBT  A2  A  A-  COMMERCIAL PAPER  P-1  A-1  F1  IF OUR CREDIT RATINGS WERE LOWERED, OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT MARKETS, OUR COST OF FUNDS, AND OTHER TERMS FOR NEW DEBT ISSUANCES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. EACH OF THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES REVIEWS ITS RATING PERIODICALLY AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS WILL REMAIN THE SAME AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. FITCH RAISED OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER RATING FROM F2 TO F1 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019.  IN MARCH 2019, WE ISSUED  $1.0 BILLION  OF DEBT, AND IN JUNE 2019, WE REPAID  $1.0 BILLION  OF DEBT AT MATURITY. NOTES 5 AND 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  WE HAVE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY THROUGH A COMMITTED $2.5 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OBTAINED THROUGH A GROUP OF BANKS. IN OCTOBER 2018, WE EXTENDED THIS CREDIT FACILITY BY ONE YEAR TO OCTOBER 2023. NO BALANCES WERE OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME DURING  2019  OR  2018.  MOST OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS CONTAIN COVENANTS RELATED TO SECURED DEBT LEVELS. IN ADDITION TO A SECURED DEBT LEVEL COVENANT, OUR CREDIT FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS A DEBT LEVERAGE COVENANT. WE ARE, AND EXPECT TO REMAIN, IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , NO NOTES OR DEBENTURES CONTAINED PROVISIONS REQUIRING ACCELERATION OF PAYMENT UPON A CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE, EXCEPT THAT CERTAIN OUTSTANDING NOTES ALLOW THE NOTE HOLDERS TO PUT THE NOTES TO US IF WITHIN A MATTER OF MONTHS OF EACH OTHER WE EXPERIENCE BOTH (I) A CHANGE IN CONTROL; AND (II) OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ARE EITHER REDUCED AND THE RESULTING RATING IS NONINVESTMENT GRADE, OR OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ARE PLACED ON WATCH FOR POSSIBLE REDUCTION AND THOSE RATINGS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REDUCED AND THE RESULTING RATING IS NONINVESTMENT GRADE.  WE BELIEVE OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE ADEQUATE TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS, FINANCE ANTICIPATED EXPANSION AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, FUND DEBT MATURITIES, PAY DIVIDENDS, AND EXECUTE PURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE CONTINUE TO ANTICIPATE AMPLE ACCESS TO COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM FINANCING.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, OTHER THAN THE NEW BORROWINGS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS SINCE  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , AS REPORTED IN OUR  2018  FORM 10-K.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  21  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  THIS REPORT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY ACCOMPANIED BY THE WORDS \u201cEXPECT,\u201d \u201cMAY,\u201d \u201cCOULD,\u201d \u201cBELIEVE,\u201d \u201cWOULD,\u201d \u201cMIGHT,\u201d \u201cANTICIPATES,\u201d OR SIMILAR WORDS. THE PRINCIPAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT INCLUDE: OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, STATEMENTS REGARDING THE ADEQUACY OF AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, THE FUNDING OF DEBT MATURITIES, THE CONTINUED EXECUTION OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, OUR EXPECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND NEW LEASE COMMITMENTS, THE EXPECTED COMPLIANCE WITH DEBT COVENANTS, THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, OUR INTENTIONS REGARDING FUTURE DIVIDENDS, THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF, AND ADEQUACY OF OUR RESERVES FOR, CLAIMS, LITIGATION AND THE RESOLUTION OF TAX MATTERS, THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS.  ALL SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE INTENDED TO ENJOY THE PROTECTION OF THE SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995, AS AMENDED. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THERE IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT. THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SET FORTH ON OUR DESCRIPTION OF RISK FACTORS IN ITEM 1A OF OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , WHICH SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE MADE, AND WE DO NOT UNDERTAKE ANY OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "TARGET CORP", "CIK": 27419, "Date": "2019-11-27T00:00:00", "Ticker": "TGT", "Name": "Target Corp", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 5331.0, "Business": "MN", "Incorporated": "MN", "IRS": 410215170.0, "key": "20191127TGT", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": -0.7069102462271649, "labelr3": -0.8239340852731791, "labelr4": 0.04839490240361532, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5982916, "prof1": 0.40170845, "return1&2": 1.0070691024622715, "return1&2&3": 1.0153666880597128, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0148753023419874, "return2": 1.0070691024622715, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 1.0082393408527317, "return4": 0.999516050975964, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.00044917694496745116, "cumulative_return1&2": 9.298698974230048e-05, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 3.731442693196709e-07, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1.0350105167916033e-07, "indexx": 3599, "cumreturn1b": 1.3710711255618135, "cumreturndow": 1.0282760085846303, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0298617725317403}]}}, {"mode": "vega-lite"});
