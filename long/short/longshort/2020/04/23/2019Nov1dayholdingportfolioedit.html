EMPLOYERS ENGAGED IN HAZARDOUS INDUSTRIES PAY SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN AVERAGE RATES FOR WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION INSURANCE COMPARED TO EMPLOYERS IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, AS MEASURED PER PAYROLL DOLLAR. THE HIGHER PREMIUM RATES ARE DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE WORK PERFORMED AND THE INHERENT WORKPLACE DANGER OF OUR TARGET EMPLOYERS. HAZARDOUS INDUSTRY EMPLOYERS ALSO TEND TO HAVE LESS FREQUENT BUT MORE SEVERE CLAIMS AS COMPARED TO EMPLOYERS IN OTHER INDUSTRIES DUE TO THE NATURE OF THEIR BUSINESSES. WE PROVIDE PROACTIVE SAFETY REVIEWS OF EMPLOYERS\u2019 WORKPLACES. THESE SAFETY REVIEWS ARE A VITAL COMPONENT OF OUR UNDERWRITING PROCESS AND ALSO PROMOTE SAFER WORKPLACES. WE UTILIZE INTENSIVE CLAIMS MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT WE BELIEVE PERMIT US TO REDUCE THE OVERALL COST OF OUR CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, OUR AUDIT SERVICES ENSURE THAT OUR POLICYHOLDERS PAY THE APPROPRIATE PREMIUMS REQUIRED UNDER THE TERMS OF THEIR POLICIES AND ENABLE US TO MONITOR PAYROLL PATTERNS THAT CAUSE UNDERWRITING, SAFETY OR FRAUD CONCERNS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE HIGHER PREMIUMS TYPICALLY PAID BY OUR POLICYHOLDERS, TOGETHER WITH OUR DISCIPLINED UNDERWRITING AND SAFETY, CLAIMS AND AUDIT SERVICES, PROVIDE US WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN ATTRACTIVE RETURNS FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  WE ACTIVELY MARKET OUR INSURANCE IN 27 STATES THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENCIES, AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR WHOLLY OWNED INSURANCE AGENCY SUBSIDIARY. WE ARE ALSO LICENSED IN AN ADDITIONAL 20 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  UNDERSTANDING OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS KEY TO UNDERSTANDING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS SOME OF THESE POLICIES TO BE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE PRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE US TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. SOME OF THE ESTIMATES RESULT FROM JUDGMENTS THAT CAN BE SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ACTUAL RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS MIGHT DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES RELATE TO THE REPORTING OF RESERVES FOR LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, INCLUDING LOSSES THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT HAVE NOT BEEN REPORTED PRIOR TO THE REPORTING DATE, AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM REINSURERS, PREMIUMS RECEIVABLE, ASSESSMENTS, DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES, THE IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR INCURRED AMOUNTS FOR CERTAIN ACCIDENT YEARS, PARTICULARLY 2014 THROUGH 2017, DEVELOPED MORE FAVORABLY THAN MANAGEMENT PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. THE REVISIONS TO THE COMPANY\u2019S RESERVES REFLECT NEW INFORMATION GAINED BY CLAIMS ADJUSTERS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF ADJUSTING CLAIMS AND IS REFLECTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHEN THE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. IT IS TYPICAL FOR MORE SERIOUS CLAIMS TO TAKE SEVERAL YEARS OR LONGER TO SETTLE AND THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVISES ESTIMATES AS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT CLAIMANTS\u2019 MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND POTENTIAL DISABILITY BECOMES KNOWN AND THE CLAIMS GET CLOSER TO BEING SETTLED.  MULTIPLE FACTORS CAN CAUSE BOTH FAVORABLE AND UNFAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT. THE FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT WE EXPERIENCED ACROSS ACCIDENT YEARS WAS LARGELY DUE TO FAVORABLE CASE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT FROM CLOSED CLAIMS AND CLAIMS WHERE THE WORKER HAD REACHED MAXIMUM MEDICAL IMPROVEMENT.  THE ASSUMPTIONS WE USED IN ESTABLISHING OUR RESERVES WERE BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL CLAIMS DATA. HOWEVER, AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, ACTUAL RESULTS FOR CERTAIN ACCIDENT YEARS HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN OUR ASSUMPTIONS WOULD HAVE PREDICTED. WE DO NOT PRESENTLY INTEND TO MODIFY OUR ASSUMPTIONS FOR ESTABLISHING RESERVES IN LIGHT OF RECENT RESULTS. HOWEVER, IF ACTUAL RESULTS FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE ACCIDENT YEARS ARE CONSISTENT WITH, OR DIFFERENT THAN, OUR RESULTS IN THESE RECENT ACCIDENT YEARS, OUR HISTORICAL CLAIMS DATA WILL REFLECT THIS CHANGE AND, OVER TIME, WILL IMPACT THE RESERVES WE ESTABLISH FOR FUTURE CLAIMS.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\"MD&A\") IS BASED UPON ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND DISCUSSES THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR MASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. IN THIS MD&A, \"MASONITE,\" \"WE,\" \"US,\" \"OUR\" AND THE \"COMPANY\" REFER TO MASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.  THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH (I) THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND (II) THE ANNUAL AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES AND MD&A, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2018. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD ALSO BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DISCLOSURE UNDER \"SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\" ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT BASIS OF PRESENTATION.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING GLOBAL DESIGNER, MANUFACTURER AND DISTRIBUTOR OF INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR DOORS FOR THE NEW CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR, RENOVATION AND REMODELING SECTORS OF THE RESIDENTIAL AND THE NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION MARKETS. SINCE 1925, WE HAVE PROVIDED OUR CUSTOMERS WITH INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SUPERIOR SERVICE AT COMPELLING VALUES. IN ORDER TO BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND CREATE SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES, WE FOCUS ON DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, ADVANCED MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN SALES AND SERVICE SOLUTIONS.  WE MARKET AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO REMODELING CONTRACTORS, BUILDERS, HOMEOWNERS, RETAILERS, DEALERS, LUMBERYARDS, COMMERCIAL AND GENERAL CONTRACTORS AND ARCHITECTS THROUGH WELL-ESTABLISHED WHOLESALE, RETAIL AND DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AS PART OF OUR CROSS-MERCHANDISING STRATEGY. CUSTOMERS ARE PROVIDED A BROAD PRODUCT OFFERING OF INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR DOORS AND ENTRY SYSTEMS AT VARIOUS PRICE POINTS. WE MANUFACTURE A BROAD LINE OF INTERIOR DOORS, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL MOLDED, FLUSH, STILE AND RAIL, LOUVER AND SPECIALLY-ORDERED COMMERCIAL AND ARCHITECTURAL DOORS; DOOR COMPONENTS FOR INTERNAL USE AND SALE TO OTHER DOOR MANUFACTURERS; AND EXTERIOR RESIDENTIAL STEEL, FIBERGLASS AND WOOD DOORS AND ENTRY SYSTEMS.  WE OPERATE 67 MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES IN 8 COUNTRIES IN NORTH AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND ASIA, WHICH ARE STRATEGICALLY LOCATED TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THESE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS INCLUDE: (I) DIRECT DISTRIBUTION TO RETAIL HOME CENTER CUSTOMERS AND HOMEBUILDERS; (II) ONE-STEP DISTRIBUTION THAT SELLS DIRECTLY TO HOMEBUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS; AND (III) TWO-STEP DISTRIBUTION THROUGH WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS. FOR RETAIL HOME CENTER CUSTOMERS, NUMEROUS DOOR FABRICATION FACILITIES PROVIDE VALUE-ADDED FABRICATION AND LOGISTICAL SERVICES, INCLUDING PRE-FINISHING AND STORE DELIVERY OF PRE-HUNG INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR DOORS. WE BELIEVE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE: (I) A BROAD PRODUCT RANGE; (II) FREQUENT, RAPID, ON-TIME AND COMPLETE DELIVERY; (III) CONSISTENCY IN PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISING; (IV) NATIONAL SERVICE; AND (V) SPECIAL ORDER PROGRAMS ENABLES RETAIL CUSTOMERS TO INCREASE COMPARABLE STORE SALES AND HELPS TO DIFFERENTIATE US FROM OUR COMPETITORS. WE BELIEVE INVESTMENTS IN INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES, COUPLED WITH AN ONGOING COMMITMENT TO OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, PROVIDE A STRONG PLATFORM FOR FUTURE GROWTH.  OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE ORGANIZED AND MANAGED PRINCIPALLY BY END MARKET: NORTH AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL, EUROPE AND ARCHITECTURAL. IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, WE GENERATED NET SALES OF $1,107.2 MILLION OR 67.3%, $241.2 MILLION OR 14.7% AND $279.3 MILLION OR 17.0% IN OUR NORTH AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL, EUROPE AND ARCHITECTURAL SEGMENTS, RESPECTIVELY.  KEY FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  PRODUCT DEMAND  THERE ARE NUMEROUS FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE OVERALL MARKET DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. DEMAND FOR NEW HOMES, HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS AND OTHER BUILDING CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN UNITED STATES, CANADIAN, EUROPEAN, ASIAN OR OTHER GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING INFLATION, DEFLATION, INTEREST RATES, AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL, CONSUMER  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION  SPENDING RATES, ENERGY AVAILABILITY AND COSTS, AND THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENTAL INITIATIVES TO MANAGE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, TRENDS IN RESIDENTIAL NEW CONSTRUCTION, REPAIR, RENOVATION AND REMODELING AND ARCHITECTURAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION MAY DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. ACCORDINGLY, THE FOLLOWING FACTORS MAY HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS IN THE COUNTRIES AND REGIONS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD.  \u2022  THE STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY;  \u2022  THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION;  \u2022  HOUSING SALES AND HOME VALUES;  \u2022  THE AGE OF EXISTING HOME STOCK, HOME VACANCY RATES AND FORECLOSURES;  \u2022  NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDING OCCUPANCY RATES;  \u2022  INCREASES IN THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS OR WAGES OR ANY SHORTAGE IN SUPPLIES OR LABOR;  \u2022  THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CREDIT;  \u2022  EMPLOYMENT RATES AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE; AND  \u2022  DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS IMMIGRATION AND MIGRATION OF THE POPULATION AND TRENDS IN HOUSEHOLD FORMATION.  ADDITIONALLY, THE UNITED KINGDOM'S (\"UK\") ANTICIPATED EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION (\"EU\") (\"BREXIT\") HAS CREATED UNCERTAINTY IN EUROPEAN DEMAND, PARTICULARLY IN THE UK, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE ANTICIPATED EXIT HAS BEEN POSTPONED AND THE NEW DEADLINE IS CURRENTLY JANUARY 31, 2020.  PRODUCT PRICING AND MIX  THE BUILDING PRODUCTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND WE THEREFORE FACE PRESSURE ON SALES PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, OUR COMPETITORS MAY ADOPT MORE AGGRESSIVE SALES POLICIES AND DEVOTE GREATER RESOURCES TO THE DEVELOPMENT, PROMOTION AND SALE OF THEIR PRODUCTS THAN WE DO, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF CUSTOMERS. OUR BUSINESS IN GENERAL IS SUBJECT TO CHANGING CONSUMER AND INDUSTRY TRENDS, DEMANDS AND PREFERENCES. TRENDS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY CHANGE OFTEN AND OUR FAILURE TO ANTICIPATE, IDENTIFY OR QUICKLY REACT TO CHANGES IN THESE TRENDS COULD LEAD TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REJECTION OF A NEW PRODUCT LINE AND REDUCED DEMAND AND PRICE REDUCTIONS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US. CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES MAY ALSO LEAD TO INCREASED DEMAND FOR OUR LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS RELATIVE TO OUR HIGHER MARGIN PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.  ON OCTOBER 30, 2019, WE COMMUNICATED PRICE INCREASES THAT BECOME EFFECTIVE ON FEBRUARY 3, 2020, TO OUR NORTH AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS THAT, FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS, WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN OUR TYPICAL ANNUAL INCREASES. WE ALSO COMMUNICATED OUR INTENT TO INCREMENTALLY INVEST $100 MILLION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IN THE AREAS OF SERVICE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS, PRODUCT INNOVATION AND END USER MARKETING. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THESE INITIATIVES ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE PROFILE OF, AND DEMAND FOR, OUR PRODUCTS AND THAT THEY WILL BENEFIT BOTH US AND OUR CUSTOMERS, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OUR EFFORTS WILL ULTIMATELY BE SUCCESSFUL OR HOW OUR CUSTOMERS WILL REACT TO THESE INITIATIVES WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FUTURE PERIODS.  BUSINESS WINS AND LOSSES  OUR CUSTOMERS CONSIST MAINLY OF WHOLESALERS AND RETAIL HOME CENTERS. IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, OUR TOP TEN CUSTOMERS TOGETHER ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 44% OF OUR NET SALES AND OUR TOP CUSTOMER, THE HOME DEPOT, INC. ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 18% OF OUR NET SALES. NET SALES FROM CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR NET SALES IN PAST PERIODS, INDIVIDUALLY OR AS A GROUP, MAY NOT CONTINUE IN FUTURE PERIODS, OR IF CONTINUED, MAY NOT REACH OR EXCEED HISTORICAL LEVELS IN ANY PERIOD. CERTAIN CUSTOMERS PERFORM PERIODIC PRODUCT LINE REVIEWS TO ASSESS THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WHICH HAVE, ON PAST OCCASIONS, LED TO BUSINESS WINS AND LOSSES. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESSES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO INCREASE OR MAINTAIN THE MARGINS AT WHICH WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS.  ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING  OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE ENGAGED IN A SERIES OF RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS RELATED TO EXITING CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES AND NON-CORE BUSINESSES, CONSOLIDATING CERTAIN INTERNAL SUPPORT FUNCTIONS AND ENGAGING IN OTHER ACTIONS DESIGNED TO REDUCE OUR COST STRUCTURE AND IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY. THESE INITIATIVES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF SEVERANCE ACTIONS AND LEASE TERMINATION COSTS. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS; THEREFORE, IN FUTURE YEARS, THERE MAY BE ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR NEW PLAN INITIATIVES, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ESTIMATES, AS PAYMENTS ARE MADE  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION  OR ACTIONS ARE COMPLETED. ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE ALSO INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS FOR THOSE ASSETS SOLD, ABANDONED OR MADE OBSOLETE AS A RESULT OF THESE PROGRAMS.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE BEGAN IMPLEMENTING A PLAN TO IMPROVE OVERALL BUSINESS PERFORMANCE THAT INCLUDES THE REORGANIZATION OF OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY AND A REDUCTION OF OUR OVERHEAD AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION WORKFORCE ACROSS ALL OF OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND IN OUR HEAD OFFICES. THE REORGANIZATION OF OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY INVOLVES SPECIFIC PLANTS IN THE NORTH AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL AND ARCHITECTURAL SEGMENTS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSURE OF THESE PLANTS AND RELATED HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS BEGAN TAKING PLACE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 (COLLECTIVELY, THE \"2019 PLAN\"). COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2019 PLAN INCLUDE SEVERANCE, RETENTION AND CLOSURE CHARGES AND WILL CONTINUE THROUGH 2020. ADDITIONALLY, THE PLAN TO DIVEST NON-CORE ASSETS WAS DETERMINED TO BE A TRIGGERING EVENT REQUIRING A TEST OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE DEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS RELATING TO THE DIVESTITURES, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 13. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, WE EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $8 MILLION TO $10 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CHARGES RELATED TO THE 2019 PLAN. ONCE FULLY IMPLEMENTED, THE ACTIONS TAKEN AS PART OF THE 2019 PLAN ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE OUR ANNUAL EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS BY APPROXIMATELY $14 MILLION TO $19 MILLION.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WE BEGAN IMPLEMENTING A PLAN TO REORGANIZE AND CONSOLIDATE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR UNITED KINGDOM HEAD OFFICE FUNCTION AND OPTIMIZE OUR PORTFOLIO BY DIVESTING NON-CORE ASSETS TO ENABLE MORE EFFECTIVE AND CONSISTENT BUSINESS PROCESSES IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, IN THE NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT WE ANNOUNCED A NEW FACILITY THAT WILL OPTIMIZE AND EXPAND CAPACITY THROUGH INCREASED AUTOMATION, WHICH RESULTED IN THE CLOSURE OF ONE EXISTING FACILITY AND RELATED HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 (COLLECTIVELY, THE \"2018 PLAN\"). COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2018 PLAN INCLUDE SEVERANCE, RETENTION AND CLOSURE CHARGES AND WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT 2019. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, WE EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CHARGES RELATED TO THE 2018 PLAN. ONCE FULLY IMPLEMENTED, THE ACTIONS TAKEN AS PART OF THE 2018 PLAN ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE OUR ANNUAL EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS BY APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATION  OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FLUCTUATING EXCHANGE RATES. IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, APPROXIMATELY 32% OF OUR NET SALES WERE GENERATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR COSTS DURING THE SAME PERIOD WERE NOT DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR MOST OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, THE PRICES FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR RAW MATERIALS ARE QUOTED IN THE DOMESTIC CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE FACILITY IS LOCATED OR OTHER CURRENCIES THAT ARE NOT U.S. DOLLARS. WE ALSO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL ASSETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, THE VOLATILITY IN THE PRICE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR HAS EXPOSED, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY CONTINUE TO EXPOSE, US TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS. ALSO, SINCE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS, CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND OTHER CURRENCIES HAVE HAD, AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE, AN IMPACT ON MANY ASPECTS OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES FOR ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE MAY REQUIRE US TO RAISE THE PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THAT COUNTRY OR ALLOW OUR COMPETITORS TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS AT LOWER PRICES IN THAT COUNTRY. UNREALIZED EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM THE TRANSLATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF OUR NON-U.S. FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OPERATIONS ARE ACCUMULATED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ACCOUNT IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).  SINCE THE UK TRIGGERED BREXIT, THERE HAS BEEN INSTABILITY IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY IN THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE POUND STERLING TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. THE AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE POUND STERLING TO THE U.S. DOLLAR DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, WAS 6% LOWER THAN THE AVERAGE FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, WHICH HAS IMPACTED OUR NET SALES AND NET INCOME IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT. FUTURE VOLATILITY IN THE POUND STERLING COULD CONTINUE AS THE TERMS OF THE UK'S ANTICIPATED EXIT FROM THE EU REMAIN UNCERTAIN. CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT IN PLACE FOR THE UK TO EXIT THE EU THAT HAS BEEN RATIFIED BY BRITISH PARLIAMENT. IF THE UK EXITS THE EU WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT IN PLACE, IT WILL LIKELY CREATE FURTHER UNCERTAINTY AND CURRENCY VOLATILITY, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE COST OF GOODS IMPORTED INTO OUR UK OPERATIONS OR DECREASE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR UK OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, SINCE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS, VOLATILITY IN THE POUND STERLING AFFECTS OUR REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOWS. IN THE LONGER TERM, ANY IMPACT FROM BREXIT ON OUR UK OPERATIONS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE OUTCOME OF TARIFF, TRADE, REGULATORY AND OTHER NEGOTIATIONS.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION  INFLATION  AN INCREASE IN INFLATION COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COST OF OUR RAW MATERIAL INPUTS. WAGE INFLATION, INCREASED PRICES FOR RAW MATERIALS OR FINISHED GOODS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS, TARIFFS AND/OR INTERRUPTIONS IN DELIVERIES OF RAW MATERIALS OR FINISHED GOODS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY, MARGINS AND NET SALES, PARTICULARLY IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PASS THESE INCURRED COSTS ON TO OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, INTEREST RATES NORMALLY INCREASE DURING PERIODS OF RISING INFLATION. HISTORICALLY, AS INTEREST RATES INCREASE, DEMAND FOR NEW HOMES AND HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS DECREASES.  SEASONALITY  OUR BUSINESS IS MODERATELY SEASONAL AND OUR NET SALES VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER BASED UPON THE TIMING OF THE BUILDING SEASON IN OUR MARKETS. SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS IN ANY QUARTER, SUCH AS UNUSUALLY PROLONGED WARM OR COLD CONDITIONS, RAIN, BLIZZARDS OR HURRICANES, COULD ACCELERATE, DELAY OR HALT CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION ACTIVITY.  ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITION  WE HAVE PURSUED A STRATEGIC INITIATIVE OF OPTIMIZING OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS PORTFOLIO. AS PART OF THIS STRATEGY, IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE PURSUED STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS TARGETING COMPANIES WHO PRODUCE COMPONENTS FOR OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS, MANUFACTURE NICHE PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE VALUE-ADDED SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, WE TARGET COMPANIES WITH STRONG BRANDS, COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES, ATTRACTIVE GEOGRAPHIC FOOTPRINTS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR COST AND DISTRIBUTION SYNERGIES. WE ALSO CONTINUOUSLY ANALYZE OUR OPERATIONS TO DETERMINE WHICH BUSINESSES, MARKET CHANNELS AND PRODUCTS CREATE THE MOST VALUE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND ACCEPTABLE RETURNS FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  ACQUISITIONS  \u2022  TOP DOORS  .  ON AUGUST 29, 2019, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF TOPDOORS, S.R.O. (\"TOP DOORS\") BASED IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC FOR CASH CONSIDERATION OF $1.6 MILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED. TOP DOORS IS A SPECIALIST MANUFACTURER OF DOOR FRAMES.  \u2022  BWI.  ON NOVEMBER 1, 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF THE OPERATING ASSETS OF BRIDGEWATER WHOLESALERS INC. (\"BWI\") FOR CASH CONSIDERATION OF $22.3 MILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED. BWI IS HEADQUARTERED IN BRANCHBURG, NEW JERSEY, AND IS A FABRICATOR AND DISTRIBUTOR OF RESIDENTIAL INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR DOOR SYSTEMS, SUPPORTING CUSTOMERS IN THE MID-ATLANTIC AND NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS INCLUDE RESIDENTIAL INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR DOORS, COMMERCIAL DOORS AND HARDWARE AS WELL AS VALUE ADDED PRE-FINISHING SERVICES.  \u2022  GRAHAM AND MAIMAN.  ON JUNE 1, 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF THE OPERATING ASSETS OF THE WOOD DOOR COMPANIES OF AADG, INC., INCLUDING THE BRANDS GRAHAM MANUFACTURING CORPORATION AND THE MAIMAN COMPANY (COLLECTIVELY, \"GRAHAM & MAIMAN\"). WE ACQUIRED THE OPERATING ASSETS OF GRAHAM & MAIMAN FOR CASH CONSIDERATION OF $39.0 MILLION. GRAHAM & MAIMAN ARE BASED IN MASON CITY, IOWA, AND SPRINGFIELD, MISSOURI. GRAHAM & MAIMAN PROVIDE THE NON-RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WITH A FULL RANGE OF ARCHITECTURAL PREMIUM AND CUSTOM GRADE FLUSH WOOD DOORS, ARCHITECTURAL STILE AND RAIL WOOD DOORS, THERMAL-FUSED FLUSH WOOD DOORS AND WOOD DOOR FRAMES.  \u2022  DW3.  ON JANUARY 29, 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF DW3 PRODUCTS HOLDINGS LIMITED (\"DW3\"), A LEADING UK PROVIDER OF HIGH QUALITY PREMIUM DOOR SOLUTIONS AND WINDOW SYSTEMS, SUPPLYING PRODUCTS UNDER BRAND NAMES SUCH AS SOLIDOR, RESIDOR, NICEDOR AND RESIDENCE. WE ACQUIRED 100% OF THE EQUITY INTERESTS IN DW3 FOR CASH CONSIDERATION OF $96.3 MILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED. DW3 IS BASED IN STOKE-ON-TRENT AND GLOUCESTER, ENGLAND, AND THEIR ONLINE QUICK SHIP CAPABILITIES AND PRODUCT PORTFOLIO BOTH COMPLEMENT AND EXPAND THE STRATEGIES WE ARE PURSUING WITH OUR BUSINESS.  DISPOSITION  \u2022  PDS.  ON MARCH 21, 2019, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF ALL OF THE CAPITAL STOCK OF PERFORMANCE DOORSET SOLUTIONS LIMITED (\"PDS\") FOR NOMINAL CONSIDERATION. THE DISPOSITION OF THIS BUSINESS RESULTED IN A LOSS ON DECONSOLIDATION OF $4.6 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECOGNIZED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION  COMPONENTS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED \"COMPONENTS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2018.

THE ALLOCATIONS GENERALLY CONSIST OF CERTAIN COSTS OF HUMAN RESOURCES, LEGAL, FINANCE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS FOR OPERATIONS VARY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, THE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR ABL FACILITY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SALES PROGRAM WITH A THIRD PARTY (\"AR SALES PROGRAM\") AND OUR EXISTING CASH BALANCE. OUR ANTICIPATED USES OF CASH IN THE NEAR TERM INCLUDE WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND SHARE REPURCHASES. ON A CONTINUAL BASIS, WE EVALUATE AND CONSIDER STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND JOINT VENTURES TO CREATE SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND ENHANCE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH BALANCE ON HAND, FUTURE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, THE USE OF OUR AR SALES PROGRAM, OUR ABL FACILITY, AND ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS WILL PROVIDE ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, WE HAD $110.0 MILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR ABL FACILITY OF $187.0 MILLION AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR AR SALES PROGRAM OF $14.6 MILLION.  CASH FLOWS  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $138.4 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, COMPARED TO $140.5 MILLION IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THIS $2.1 MILLION DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO A $1.8 MILLION DECREASE IN OUR NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO MASONITE, ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH AND NON-OPERATING ITEMS AND CHANGES IN NET WORKING CAPITAL IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $59.1 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, COMPARED TO $188.0 MILLION IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THIS $128.9 MILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS OF $133.4 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $4.3 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND A NET INCREASE IN OTHER INVESTING OUTFLOWS OF $0.2 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $84.1 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED OF $63.4 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THIS $147.5 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS DRIVEN BY A NET INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR DEBT-RELATED TRANSACTIONS OF $186.0 MILLION PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $36.1 MILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR REPURCHASES OF COMMON SHARES, A $2.1 MILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR TAX WITHHOLDING ON SHARE BASED AWARDS AND A DECREASE IN OTHER FINANCING OUTFLOWS OF $0.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  SHARE REPURCHASES  WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN PLACE A $600 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION, STEMMING FROM THREE SEPARATE AUTHORIZATIONS BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ON FEBRUARY 23, 2016, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHEREBY WE MAY REPURCHASE UP TO $150 MILLION WORTH OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES AND ON FEBRUARY 22, 2017, AND MAY 10, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL $200 MILLION AND $250 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY (COLLECTIVELY, THE \"SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS\"). THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS HAVE NO SPECIFIED END DATE AND THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF ANY SHARE REPURCHASES WILL BE DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT BASED ON OUR EVALUATION OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. ANY REPURCHASES UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS MAY BE MADE IN THE OPEN MARKET, IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS OR OTHERWISE, SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS, APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS DO NOT OBLIGATE US TO ACQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR AMOUNT OF COMMON SHARES, AND THEY MAY BE SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED AT ANY TIME AT OUR DISCRETION. REPURCHASES UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION  ARE PERMITTED TO BE MADE UNDER ONE OR MORE RULE 10B5-1 PLANS, WHICH WOULD PERMIT SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED WHEN WE MIGHT OTHERWISE BE PRECLUDED FROM DOING SO UNDER APPLICABLE INSIDER TRADING LAWS. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 1,148,815 OF OUR COMMON SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET AT AN AGGREGATE COST OF $58.4 MILLION AS PART OF THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WE REPURCHASED 1,464,700 OF OUR COMMON SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET AT AN AGGREGATE COST OF $94.5 MILLION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, THERE WAS $145.6 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS.  OTHER LIQUIDITY MATTERS  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE INCLUDES CASH HELD IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. CASH HELD OUTSIDE CANADA, IN WHICH WE ARE INCORPORATED, IS FREE FROM SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT THE CASH FROM BEING ACCESSED TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS INCLUDING, IF NECESSARY, TO FUND OPERATIONS AND SERVICE DEBT OBLIGATIONS IN CANADA. HOWEVER, EARNINGS FROM CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS ARE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS. UPON THE REPATRIATION OF ANY EARNINGS TO CANADA, IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR OTHERWISE, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CANADIAN INCOME TAXES AND WITHHOLDING TAXES PAYABLE TO THE VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, WE DO NOT BELIEVE ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES EXIST THAT RESTRICT OUR USE OF CASH OR CASH EQUIVALENTS IN A MATERIAL MANNER.  WE ALSO ROUTINELY MONITOR THE CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THERE HAS NOT BEEN A CHANGE IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF A CUSTOMER THAT HAS HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WERE TO DETERIORATE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD BE AN IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE PERIOD AND THIS IMPACT COULD BE MATERIAL.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SALES PROGRAM  WE MAINTAIN AN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SALES PROGRAM WITH A THIRD PARTY (THE \"AR SALES PROGRAM\"). UNDER THE AR SALES PROGRAM, WE CAN TRANSFER OWNERSHIP OF ELIGIBLE TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF CERTAIN CUSTOMERS. RECEIVABLES ARE SOLD OUTRIGHT TO A THIRD PARTY THAT ASSUMES THE FULL RISK OF COLLECTION, WITHOUT RECOURSE TO US IN THE EVENT OF A LOSS. TRANSFERS OF RECEIVABLES UNDER THIS PROGRAM ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES. PROCEEDS FROM THE TRANSFERS REFLECT THE FACE VALUE OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE LESS A DISCOUNT. RECEIVABLES SOLD UNDER THE AR SALES PROGRAM ARE EXCLUDED FROM TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND ARE INCLUDED IN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. THE DISCOUNTS ON THE SALES OF TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SOLD UNDER THE AR SALES PROGRAM WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED AND WERE RECORDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION EXPENSE WITHIN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

ABL FACILITY  ON JANUARY 31, 2019, WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AMENDED AND RESTATED OUR ASSET-BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \"ABL FACILITY\") IN ORDER TO EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE OF THE ABL FACILITY AND AMEND CERTAIN OTHER PROVISIONS. THE AMENDED AND RESTATED ABL FACILITY INCREASED THE REVOLVING COMMITMENTS TO $250.0 MILLION FROM $150.0 MILLION AND EXTENDED THE FINAL MATURITY DATE TO JANUARY 31, 2024, FROM APRIL 9, 2020. THE BORROWING BASE IS CALCULATED BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE VALUE OF SELECTED U.S., CANADIAN AND U.K. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY, LESS CERTAIN INELIGIBLE AMOUNTS. OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE ABL FACILITY ARE SECURED BY A FIRST PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN SUCH ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY AND OTHER RELATED ASSETS OF MASONITE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES.

SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION  AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE ABL FACILITY ARE SECURED BY A FIRST PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE CURRENT ASSETS OF MASONITE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES.

THE FOLLOWING UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR OUR NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES IS PRESENTED.  OUR NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES GENERATED EXTERNAL NET SALES OF $491.9 MILLION AND $1.5 BILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, AND $490.4 MILLION AND $1.4 BILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OUR NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES GENERATED ADJUSTED EBITDA OF $65.0 MILLION AND $189.8 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, AND $59.5 MILLION AND $175.7 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OUR NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES HAD TOTAL ASSETS OF $2.0 BILLION AND $1.8 BILLION AND TOTAL LIABILITIES OF $853.5 MILLION AND $711.8 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, AND DECEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED \"CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\" IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2018, OTHER THAN AS NOTED BELOW.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION  GOODWILL  WE EVALUATE ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND REPORTED APART FROM GOODWILL. GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD IS TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT ON THE LAST DAY OF FISCAL NOVEMBER, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT IS PERFORMED AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL BY COMPARING THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S CARRYING AMOUNT TO ITS FAIR VALUE. POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT IN GOODWILL IS FIRST ANALYZED USING QUALITATIVE FACTORS SUCH AS MACROECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, CHANGING COSTS AND ACTUAL AND PROJECTED PERFORMANCE, AMONGST OTHERS, TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE BOOK VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE. IF IT IS DETERMINED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE BOOK VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE, A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED TO TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT. WHEN QUANTITATIVE STEPS ARE DETERMINED NECESSARY, THE FAIR VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS ARE ESTIMATED THROUGH THE USE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES AND MARKET MULTIPLES. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE, THEN GOODWILL IS IMPAIRED. ANY IMPAIRMENT IN GOODWILL IS MEASURED BY ALLOCATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO A PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION AND COMPARING THE NOTIONAL GOODWILL FROM THE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WE PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL FOR ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, INCLUDING THE ARCHITECTURAL REPORTING UNIT, DETERMINING THAT GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED BASED UPON THE FORECASTS UTILIZED IN THAT TEST. WHILE THERE WAS NO IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT AT THAT TIME, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE ESTIMATE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FOR THE ARCHITECTURAL REPORTING UNIT MAY CHANGE IN THE NEAR TERM BASED UPON ACTUAL RESULTS AND UPDATED FORWARD-LOOKING FORECASTS, RESULTING IN THE NEED TO WRITE DOWN GOODWILL TO ITS FAIR VALUE.

PROSPECT IS A FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY THAT PRIMARILY LENDS TO AND INVESTS IN MIDDLE MARKET PRIVATELY-HELD COMPANIES. WE ARE A CLOSED-END INVESTMENT COMPANY INCORPORATED IN MARYLAND. WE HAVE ELECTED TO BE REGULATED AS A BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COMPANY (\u201cBDC\u201d) UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 (THE \u201c1940 ACT\u201d). AS A BDC, WE HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANY (\u201cRIC\u201d), UNDER SUBCHAPTER M OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986 (THE \u201cCODE\u201d). WE WERE ORGANIZED ON APRIL 13, 2004, AND WERE FUNDED IN AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING COMPLETED ON JULY 27, 2004.  ON MAY 15, 2007, WE FORMED A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY PROSPECT CAPITAL FUNDING LLC (\u201cPCF\u201d), A DELAWARE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AND A BANKRUPTCY REMOTE SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY, WHICH HOLDS CERTAIN OF OUR PORTFOLIO LOAN INVESTMENTS THAT ARE USED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT PCF. OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY PROSPECT SMALL BUSINESS LENDING, LLC (\u201cPSBL\u201d) WAS FORMED ON JANUARY 27, 2014, AND PURCHASES SMALL BUSINESS WHOLE LOANS ON A RECURRING BASIS FROM ONLINE SMALL BUSINESS LOAN ORIGINATORS, INCLUDING ON DECK CAPITAL, INC. (\u201cONDECK\u201d). ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2014, WE FORMED A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY PROSPECT YIELD CORPORATION, LLC (\u201cPYC\u201d) AND EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 23, 2014, PYC HOLDS A PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN RATED SECURED STRUCTURED NOTES (\u201cRSSN\u201d) AND SUBORDINATED STRUCTURED NOTES (\u201cSSN\u201d) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \u201cCOLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATIONS\u201d OR \u201cCLOS\u201d). EACH OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED SINCE OPERATIONS COMMENCED.  WE CONSOLIDATE CERTAIN OF OUR WHOLLY OWNED AND SUBSTANTIALLY WHOLLY OWNED HOLDING COMPANIES FORMED BY US IN ORDER TO FACILITATE OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY. THE FOLLOWING COMPANIES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE \u201cCONSOLIDATED HOLDING COMPANIES\u201d.  CP HOLDINGS OF DELAWARE LLC (\u201cCP HOLDINGS\u201d); CREDIT CENTRAL HOLDINGS OF DELAWARE, LLC (\u201cCREDIT CENTRAL DELAWARE\u201d); ENERGY SOLUTIONS HOLDINGS INC.; FIRST TOWER HOLDINGS OF DELAWARE LLC (\u201cFIRST TOWER DELAWARE\u201d); MITY HOLDINGS OF DELAWARE INC.

(\u201cVALLEY HOLDINGS I\u201d); VALLEY ELECTRIC HOLDINGS II, INC. (\u201cVALLEY HOLDINGS II\u201d); AND WOLF ENERGY HOLDINGS INC. (\u201cWOLF ENERGY HOLDINGS\u201d).  WE ARE EXTERNALLY MANAGED BY OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER, PROSPECT CAPITAL MANAGEMENT L.P. (\u201cPROSPECT CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\u201d OR THE \u201cINVESTMENT ADVISER\u201d). PROSPECT ADMINISTRATION LLC (\u201cPROSPECT ADMINISTRATION\u201d  ),  A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISER, PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES AND FACILITIES NECESSARY FOR US TO OPERATE.  OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO GENERATE BOTH CURRENT INCOME AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL APPRECIATION THROUGH DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. WE INVEST PRIMARILY IN SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT AND EQUITY OF PRIVATE COMPANIES IN NEED OF CAPITAL FOR ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, GROWTH, DEVELOPMENT, RECAPITALIZATIONS AND OTHER PURPOSES. WE WORK WITH THE MANAGEMENT TEAMS OR FINANCIAL SPONSORS TO SEEK INVESTMENTS WITH HISTORICAL CASH FLOWS, ASSET COLLATERAL OR CONTRACTED PRO FORMA CASH FLOWS.  WE CURRENTLY HAVE NINE STRATEGIES THAT GUIDE OUR ORIGINATION OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES: (1) LENDING TO COMPANIES CONTROLLED BY PRIVATE EQUITY SPONSORS, (2) LENDING TO COMPANIES NOT CONTROLLED BY PRIVATE EQUITY SPONSORS, (3) PURCHASING CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS AND LENDING TO OPERATING COMPANIES, (4) PURCHASING CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS AND LENDING TO FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, (5) PURCHASING CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS AND LENDING TO REAL ESTATE COMPANIES, (6) PURCHASING CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS AND LENDING TO AIRCRAFT LEASING COMPANIES, (7) INVESTING IN STRUCTURED CREDIT, (8) INVESTING IN SYNDICATED DEBT, AND (9) INVESTING IN CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS LOANS AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATIONS. WE MAY ALSO INVEST IN OTHER STRATEGIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FROM TIME TO TIME THAT WE VIEW AS ATTRACTIVE. WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OTHER ORIGINATION STRATEGIES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS WITH NO SPECIFIC TOP-DOWN ALLOCATION TO ANY SINGLE ORIGINATION STRATEGY.  103  LENDING TO COMPANIES CONTROLLED BY PRIVATE EQUITY SPONSORS - WE MAKE AGENTED LOANS TO COMPANIES WHICH ARE CONTROLLED BY PRIVATE EQUITY SPONSORS. THIS DEBT CAN TAKE THE FORM OF FIRST LIEN, SECOND LIEN, UNITRANCHE OR UNSECURED LOANS. THESE LOANS TYPICALLY HAVE EQUITY SUBORDINATE TO OUR LOAN POSITION. HISTORICALLY, THIS STRATEGY HAS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 25%-50% OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  LENDING TO COMPANIES NOT CONTROLLED BY PRIVATE EQUITY SPONSORS - WE MAKE LOANS TO COMPANIES WHICH ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY PRIVATE EQUITY SPONSORS, SUCH AS COMPANIES THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY THE MANAGEMENT TEAM, THE FOUNDER, A FAMILY OR PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS. THIS ORIGINATION STRATEGY MAY HAVE LESS COMPETITION TO PROVIDE DEBT FINANCING THAN THE PRIVATE-EQUITY-SPONSOR ORIGINATION STRATEGY BECAUSE SUCH COMPANY FINANCING NEEDS ARE NOT EASILY ADDRESSED BY BANKS AND OFTEN REQUIRE MORE DILIGENCE PREPARATION. THIS ORIGINATION STRATEGY CAN RESULT IN INVESTMENTS WITH HIGHER RETURNS OR LOWER LEVERAGE THAN THE PRIVATE-EQUITY-SPONSOR ORIGINATION STRATEGY. HISTORICALLY, THIS STRATEGY HAS COMPRISED LESS THAN 5% OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  PURCHASING CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS AND LENDING TO OPERATING COMPANIES - THIS STRATEGY INVOLVES PURCHASING YIELD-PRODUCING DEBT AND CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS IN NON-FINANCIAL-SERVICES OPERATING COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE ENHANCED CERTAINTY OF CLOSURE AND LIQUIDITY TO SELLERS AND WE LOOK FOR MANAGEMENT TO CONTINUE ON IN THEIR CURRENT ROLES. THIS STRATEGY HAS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 5%-10% OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  PURCHASING CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS AND LENDING TO FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES - THIS STRATEGY INVOLVES PURCHASING YIELD-PRODUCING DEBT AND CONTROL EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, INCLUDING CONSUMER DIRECT LENDING, SUB-PRIME AUTO LENDING AND OTHER STRATEGIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE OFTEN STRUCTURED IN TAX-EFFICIENT PARTNERSHIPS, ENHANCING RETURNS. THIS STRATEGY HAS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 5%-15% OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  PURCHASING CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS AND LENDING TO REAL ESTATE COMPANIES - WE PURCHASE DEBT AND CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS IN TAX-EFFICIENT REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\u201cREIT\u201d OR \u201cREITS\u201d)  . THE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS OF NATIONAL PROPERTY REIT CORP. (\u201cNPRC\u201d) ARE IN VARIOUS CLASSES OF DEVELOPED AND OCCUPIED REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES THAT GENERATE CURRENT YIELDS, INCLUDING MULTI-FAMILY PROPERTIES, STUDENT HOUSING, AND SELF-STORAGE. NPRC SEEKS TO IDENTIFY PROPERTIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT OCCUPANCY RATES AND RECURRING CASH FLOW GENERATION. NPRC GENERALLY CO-INVESTS WITH ESTABLISHED AND EXPERIENCED PROPERTY MANAGEMENT TEAMS THAT MANAGE SUCH PROPERTIES AFTER ACQUISITION. ADDITIONALLY, NPRC PURCHASES LOANS ORIGINATED BY CERTAIN CONSUMER LOAN FACILITATORS. IT PURCHASES EACH LOAN IN ITS ENTIRETY (I.E., A \u201cWHOLE LOAN\u201d). THE BORROWERS ARE CONSUMERS, AND THE LOANS ARE TYPICALLY SERVICED BY THE FACILITATORS OF THE LOANS. THIS INVESTMENT STRATEGY HAS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 10%-20% OF OUR BUSINESS.  PURCHASING CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS AND LENDING TO AIRCRAFT LEASING COMPANIES - WE INVEST IN DEBT AS WELL AS EQUITY IN COMPANIES WITH AIRCRAFT ASSETS SUBJECT TO COMMERCIAL LEASES TO AIRLINES ACROSS THE GLOBE. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE INVESTMENTS CAN PRESENT ATTRACTIVE RETURN OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO CASH FLOW CONSISTENCY FROM LONG-TERM LEASES COUPLED WITH HARD ASSET RESIDUAL VALUE. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE INVESTMENT COMPANIES SEEK TO DELIVER RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS WITH STRONG DOWNSIDE PROTECTION BY ANALYZING RELATIVE VALUE CHARACTERISTICS ACROSS A VARIETY OF AIRCRAFT TYPES AND VINTAGES. THIS STRATEGY HISTORICALLY HAS COMPRISED LESS THAN 5% OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  INVESTING IN STRUCTURED CREDIT - WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN CLOS, OFTEN TAKING A SIGNIFICANT POSITION IN THE SUBORDINATED INTERESTS (EQUITY) AND DEBT OF THE CLOS. THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO OF EACH CLO INVESTMENT IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS APPROXIMATELY 100 TO 200 BROADLY SYNDICATED LOANS AND DOES NOT HAVE DIRECT EXPOSURE TO REAL ESTATE, MORTGAGES, OR CONSUMER-BASED CREDIT ASSETS. THE CLOS IN WHICH WE INVEST ARE MANAGED BY ESTABLISHED COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT TEAMS WITH MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE INDUSTRY. THIS STRATEGY HAS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 10%-20% OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  INVESTING IN SYNDICATED DEBT - ON A PRIMARY OR SECONDARY BASIS, WE PURCHASE PRIMARILY SENIOR AND SECURED LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS THAT HAVE BEEN SOLD TO A CLUB OR SYNDICATE OF BUYERS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE OFTEN PURCHASED WITH A LONG TERM, BUY-AND-HOLD OUTLOOK, AND WE OFTEN LOOK TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT INPUT TO THE TRANSACTION BY PROVIDING ANCHORING ORDERS. THIS STRATEGY HAS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 10%-25% OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  INVESTING IN CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS LOANS AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATIONS - WE PURCHASE LOANS ORIGINATED BY CERTAIN CONSUMER AND SMALL-AND-MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESS (\u201cSME\u201d) LOAN PLATFORMS. WE GENERALLY PURCHASE EACH LOAN IN ITS ENTIRETY (I.E., A \u201cWHOLE LOAN\u201d) AND WE INVEST IN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATIONS COLLATERALIZED BY CONSUMER OR SMALL BUSINESS LOANS. THE BORROWERS ARE CONSUMERS AND SMES AND THE LOANS ARE TYPICALLY SERVICED BY THE PLATFORMS OF THE LOANS. THIS INVESTMENT STRATEGY HAS COMPRISED UP TO APPROXIMATELY 0% OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  104  WE INVEST PRIMARILY IN FIRST AND SECOND LIEN SECURED LOANS AND UNSECURED DEBT, WHICH IN SOME CASES INCLUDES AN EQUITY COMPONENT. FIRST AND SECOND LIEN SECURED LOANS GENERALLY ARE SENIOR DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT RANK AHEAD OF UNSECURED DEBT OF A GIVEN PORTFOLIO COMPANY. THESE LOANS ALSO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF SECURITY INTERESTS ON THE ASSETS OF THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY, WHICH MAY RANK AHEAD OF OR BE JUNIOR TO OTHER SECURITY INTERESTS. OUR INVESTMENTS IN CLOS ARE SUBORDINATED TO SENIOR LOANS AND ARE GENERALLY UNSECURED. WE INVEST IN DEBT AND EQUITY POSITIONS OF CLOS WHICH ARE A FORM OF SECURITIZATION IN WHICH THE CASH FLOWS OF A PORTFOLIO OF LOANS ARE POOLED AND PASSED ON TO DIFFERENT CLASSES OF OWNERS IN VARIOUS TRANCHES. OUR CLO INVESTMENTS ARE DERIVED FROM PORTFOLIOS OF CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES WHICH ARE GENERALLY RISK RATED FROM BB TO B.  WE HOLD MANY OF OUR CONTROL INVESTMENTS IN A TWO-TIER STRUCTURE CONSISTING OF A HOLDING COMPANY AND ONE OR MORE RELATED OPERATING COMPANIES FOR TAX PURPOSES. THESE HOLDING COMPANIES SERVE VARIOUS BUSINESS PURPOSES INCLUDING CONCENTRATION OF MANAGEMENT TEAMS, OPTIMIZATION OF THIRD-PARTY BORROWING COSTS, IMPROVEMENT OF SUPPLIER, CUSTOMER, AND INSURANCE TERMS, AND ENHANCEMENT OF CO-INVESTMENTS BY THE MANAGEMENT TEAMS. IN THESE CASES, OUR INVESTMENT, WHICH IS GENERALLY EQUITY IN THE HOLDING COMPANY, THE HOLDING COMPANY\u2019S EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE OPERATING COMPANY AND ANY DEBT FROM US DIRECTLY TO THE OPERATING COMPANY STRUCTURE REPRESENTS OUR TOTAL EXPOSURE FOR THE INVESTMENT. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , AS SHOWN IN OUR  CONSOLIDATED SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS  , THE COST BASIS AND FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN CONTROLLED COMPANIES WAS  $2,346,633  AND  $2,397,730  , RESPECTIVELY. THIS STRUCTURE GIVES RISE TO SEVERAL OF THE RISKS DESCRIBED IN OUR PUBLIC DOCUMENTS AND HIGHLIGHTED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT. WE CONSOLIDATE ALL WHOLLY OWNED AND SUBSTANTIALLY WHOLLY OWNED HOLDING COMPANIES FORMED BY US FOR THE PURPOSE OF HOLDING OUR CONTROLLED INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING COMPANIES. THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF CONSOLIDATING THESE HOLDING COMPANIES AS THEY HOLD MINIMAL ASSETS OTHER THAN THEIR INVESTMENTS IN THE CONTROLLED OPERATING COMPANIES. INVESTMENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING PROHIBITS THE CONSOLIDATION OF ANY OPERATING COMPANIES.  FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS  INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS  WE SEEK TO BE A LONG-TERM INVESTOR WITH OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE ACQUIRED  $32,509  OF NEW INVESTMENTS, COMPLETED FOLLOW-ON INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING PORTFOLIO COMPANIES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  $47,033  , FUNDED  $500  OF REVOLVER ADVANCES, AND RECORDED PAID IN KIND (\u201cPIK\u201d) INTEREST OF  $14,498  , RESULTING IN GROSS INVESTMENT ORIGINATIONS OF  $94,540  .

DEBT ISSUANCES AND REDEMPTIONS  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE DECREASED TOTAL COMMITMENTS TO OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE  \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d) FOR PCF BY $55,000 TO $1,077,500 IN THE AGGREGATE.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE REPAID  $1,479  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF PROSPECT CAPITAL INTERNOTES\u00ae AT PAR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SURVIVOR\u2019S OPTION, AS DEFINED IN THE INTERNOTES\u00ae OFFERING PROSPECTUS.

AS A RESULT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS, WE RECORDED A LOSS IN THE AMOUNT OF THE UNAMORTIZED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS.

INVESTMENT HOLDINGS  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAVE  $5,450,560  , OR  167.2%  , OF OUR NET ASSETS INVESTED IN  125  LONG-TERM PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND CLOS.  OUR ANNUALIZED CURRENT YIELD WAS  12.7%  AND  13.1%  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, ACROSS ALL PERFORMING INTEREST BEARING INVESTMENTS, EXCLUDING EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND NON-ACCRUAL LOANS. OUR ANNUALIZED CURRENT YIELD WAS  10.2%  AND  10.6%  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, ACROSS ALL INVESTMENTS. MONETIZATION OF EQUITY POSITIONS THAT WE HOLD AND LOANS ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS YIELD CALCULATION. IN MANY OF OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES WE HOLD EQUITY POSITIONS, RANGING FROM MINORITY INTERESTS TO MAJORITY STAKES, WHICH WE EXPECT OVER TIME TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR INVESTMENT RETURNS. SOME OF THESE EQUITY POSITIONS INCLUDE FEATURES SUCH AS CONTRACTUAL MINIMUM INTERNAL RATES OF RETURNS, PREFERRED DISTRIBUTIONS, FLIP STRUCTURES AND OTHER FEATURES EXPECTED TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT RETURNS, AS WELL AS CONTRACTUAL PROTECTIONS AND PREFERENCES OVER JUNIOR EQUITY, IN ADDITION TO THE YIELD AND SECURITY OFFERED BY OUR CASH FLOW AND COLLATERAL DEBT PROTECTIONS.  WE ARE A NON-DIVERSIFIED COMPANY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE 1940 ACT. AS REQUIRED BY THE 1940 ACT, WE CLASSIFY OUR INVESTMENTS BY LEVEL OF CONTROL. AS DEFINED IN THE 1940 ACT, \u201cCONTROL INVESTMENTS\u201d ARE THOSE WHERE THERE IS THE ABILITY OR POWER TO EXERCISE A CONTROLLING INFLUENCE OVER THE MANAGEMENT OR POLICIES OF A COMPANY. CONTROL IS GENERALLY DEEMED TO EXIST WHEN A COMPANY OR INDIVIDUAL POSSESSES OR HAS THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE WITHIN 60 DAYS OR LESS, A BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF 25% OR MORE OF THE VOTING SECURITIES OF AN INVESTEE COMPANY. UNDER THE 1940 ACT, \u201cAFFILIATE INVESTMENTS\u201d ARE DEFINED BY A LESSER DEGREE OF INFLUENCE AND ARE DEEMED TO EXIST THROUGH THE POSSESSION OUTRIGHT OR VIA THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE WITHIN 60 DAYS OR LESS, BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF 5% OR MORE OF THE OUTSTANDING VOTING SECURITIES OF ANOTHER PERSON. \u201cNON-CONTROL/NON-AFFILIATE INVESTMENTS\u201d ARE THOSE THAT ARE NEITHER CONTROL INVESTMENTS NOR AFFILIATE INVESTMENTS. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE OWN CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN THE FOLLOWING PORTFOLIO COMPANIES: CP ENERGY SERVICES INC.

IN ORDER TO VALIDATE MARKET QUOTATIONS, MANAGEMENT AND THE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM LOOK AT A NUMBER OF FACTORS TO DETERMINE IF THE QUOTATIONS ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING THE SOURCE AND NATURE OF THE QUOTATIONS. IN DETERMINING THE RANGE OF VALUES FOR DEBT INSTRUMENTS WHERE MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, EXCEPT CLOS AND DEBT INVESTMENTS IN CONTROLLING PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, MANAGEMENT AND THE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM ESTIMATED CORPORATE AND SECURITY CREDIT RATINGS AND IDENTIFIED CORRESPONDING YIELDS TO MATURITY FOR EACH LOAN FROM RELEVANT MARKET DATA. A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUE WAS THEN APPLIED USING THE APPROPRIATE YIELD TO MATURITY AS THE DISCOUNT RATE, TO DETERMINE A RANGE OF VALUES. IN DETERMINING THE RANGE OF VALUES FOR DEBT INVESTMENTS OF CONTROLLED COMPANIES AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, THE ENTERPRISE VALUE WAS DETERMINED BY APPLYING A MARKET APPROACH SUCH AS USING EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME INTEREST, TAX, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) MULTIPLES, NET INCOME AND/OR BOOK VALUE MULTIPLES FOR SIMILAR GUIDELINE PUBLIC COMPANIES AND/OR SIMILAR RECENT INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND/OR AN INCOME APPROACH, SUCH AS THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUE. THE ENTERPRISE VALUE TECHNIQUE MAY ALSO BE USED TO VALUE DEBT INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE CREDIT IMPAIRED. FOR STRESSED DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, A LIQUIDATION ANALYSIS WAS USED.  IN DETERMINING THE RANGE OF VALUES FOR OUR INVESTMENTS IN CLOS, THE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM USES A DISCOUNTED MULTI-PATH CASH FLOW MODEL. THE VALUATIONS WERE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF THE CLO DEAL STRUCTURES TO IDENTIFY THE RISK EXPOSURES FROM THE MODELING POINT OF VIEW AS WELL AS TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE CALL DATE (I.E., EXPECTED MATURITY). THESE RISK FACTORS ARE SENSITIZED IN THE MULTI-PATH CASH FLOW MODEL USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS  , WHICH ARE SIMULATIONS USED TO MODEL THE PROBABILITY OF DIFFERENT OUTCOMES,  TO GENERATE PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED (I.E., MULTI-PATH) CASH FLOWS FOR THE UNDERLYING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THESE CASH FLOWS ARE DISCOUNTED USING APPROPRIATE MARKET DISCOUNT RATES, AND RELEVANT DATA IN THE CLO MARKET AND CERTAIN BENCHMARK CREDIT INDICES ARE CONSIDERED, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF EACH CLO INVESTMENT. IN ADDITION, WE GENERATE A SINGLE-PATH CASH FLOW UTILIZING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED CASH RECEIPTS, AND ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE IMPLIED DISCOUNT RATE THAT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE VALUE DERIVED FROM THE CORRESPONDING MULTI-PATH CASH FLOW MODEL.  WITH RESPECT TO OUR ONLINE CONSUMER AND SME LENDING INITIATIVE, WE INVEST PRIMARILY IN MARKETPLACE LOANS THROUGH MARKETPLACE LENDING PLATFORMS.  WE DO NOT CONDUCT LOAN ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES OURSELVES. THEREFORE, OUR ABILITY TO PURCHASE CONSUMER AND SME LOANS, AND OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR PORTFOLIO OF CONSUMER AND SME LOANS, ARE DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY THE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND COMPETITIVENESS OF THE MARKETPLACE LOAN ORIGINATION BUSINESS OF THE MARKETPLACE LENDING PLATFORMS FROM WHICH WE PURCHASE CONSUMER AND SME LOANS. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ANALYZE THE RISK-RETURN PROFILE OF CONSUMER AND SME LOANS IS SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON THE MARKETPLACE PLATFORMS\u2019 ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE A BORROWER'S CREDIT PROFILE AND LIKELIHOOD OF DEFAULT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE BORROWERS\u2019 CREDIT PROFILES OR THE CREDIT DECISIONING AND SCORING MODELS IMPLEMENTED BY EACH PLATFORM, WE MAY INCUR UNANTICIPATED LOSSES WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS LOOKED AT SEVERAL FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHERE WITHIN THE RANGE TO VALUE THE ASSET INCLUDING: RECENT OPERATING AND FINANCIAL TRENDS FOR THE ASSET, INDEPENDENT RATINGS OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES, COMPARABLE MULTIPLES FOR RECENT SALES OF COMPANIES WITHIN THE INDUSTRY AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS IN CLOS. THE COMPOSITE OF ALL THESE VARIOUS VALUATION TECHNIQUES, APPLIED TO EACH INVESTMENT, WAS A TOTAL VALUATION OF  $5,450,560.  OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES ARE GENERALLY LOWER MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES, OUTSIDE OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR, WITH LESS THAN $100,000 OF ANNUAL EBITDA. WE BELIEVE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS EXPERIENCED LESS VOLATILITY THAN OTHERS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THERE ARE MORE BUY AND HOLD INVESTORS WHO OWN THESE LESS LIQUID INVESTMENTS.  CONTROL INVESTMENTS OFFER INCREASED RISK AND REWARD OVER STRAIGHT DEBT INVESTMENTS. OPERATING RESULTS AND CHANGES IN MARKET MULTIPLES CAN RESULT IN DRAMATIC CHANGES IN VALUES FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER. SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURNS IN OPERATIONS CAN FURTHER RESULT IN OUR LOOKING TO RECOVERIES ON SALES OF ASSETS RATHER THAN THE ENTERPRISE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. EQUITY POSITIONS IN OUR PORTFOLIO ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN VALUE, BOTH INCREASES AS WELL AS DECREASES, DUE TO CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS AND MARKET MULTIPLES. SEVERAL OF OUR CONTROLLED COMPANIES DISCUSSED BELOW EXPERIENCED SUCH CHANGES AND WE RECORDED CORRESPONDING FLUCTUATIONS IN VALUATIONS DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.

(\u201cINTERDENT\u201d) AND TO APPOINT A NEW BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF INTERDENT, ALL THE MEMBERS OF WHICH ARE OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER\u2019S PROFESSIONALS.

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  2018  INTEREST ON BORROWINGS  $32,449  $32,985  AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS  2,241  2,716  ACCRETION OF DISCOUNT ON UNSECURED DEBT  254  131  FACILITY COMMITMENT FEES  3,954  2,076  TOTAL INTEREST AND CREDIT FACILITY EXPENSES  $38,898  $37,908  AVERAGE PRINCIPAL DEBT OUTSTANDING  $2,305,797  $2,496,642  ANNUALIZED WEIGHTED AVERAGE STATED INTEREST RATE ON BORROWINGS  (1)  5.63%  5.28%  ANNUALIZED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON BORROWINGS  (2)  6.75%  6.07%  (1)  INCLUDES ONLY THE STATED INTEREST EXPENSE.  (2)  INCLUDES THE STATED INTEREST EXPENSE, AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS, ACCRETION OF DISCOUNT ON PUBLIC NOTES AND COMMITMENT FEES ON THE UNDRAWN PORTION OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  INTEREST EXPENSE IS RELATIVELY STABLE ON A DOLLARS BASIS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  . THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE STATED INTEREST RATE ON BORROWINGS (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION, ACCRETION AND UNDRAWN FACILITY FEES) INCREASED FROM  5.28%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  TO  5.63%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO ISSUANCES OF PUBLIC NOTES AT HIGHER RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REPURCHASES OF OUR CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND INCREASED UTILIZATION OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH BEARS A LOWER RATE THAN OUR REMAINING DEBT.  THE ALLOCATION OF GROSS OVERHEAD EXPENSE FROM PROSPECT ADMINISTRATION WAS $4,078 AND $3,365 FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  PROSPECT ADMINISTRATION RECEIVED ESTIMATED PAYMENTS OF $584 DIRECTLY FROM OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, AND CERTAIN FUNDS MANAGED BY THE INVESTMENT ADVISER FOR LEGAL SERVICES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . NO SUCH PAYMENTS WERE RECEIVED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  WE WERE GIVEN A CREDIT FOR THESE PAYMENTS AS A REDUCTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES COST PAYABLE BY US TO PROSPECT ADMINISTRATION. HAD PROSPECT ADMINISTRATION NOT RECEIVED THESE PAYMENTS, PROSPECT ADMINISTRATION\u2019S CHARGES FOR ITS ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY THIS AMOUNT. NET OVERHEAD DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  TOTALED $3,494  AND  $3,365  , RESPECTIVELY.

THE $540 DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASES IN LEGAL FEES AND AUDIT, COMPLIANCE AND TAX RELATED FEES AND VALUATION SERVICES FEES.  NET INVESTMENT INCOME  NET INVESTMENT INCOME REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INVESTMENT INCOME AND OPERATING EXPENSES. NET INVESTMENT INCOME WAS  $71,060  AND  $85,159  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE OF $14,099 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME OF $18,539 PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES OF $4,440.

OUR PRIMARY USES OF FUNDS HAVE BEEN TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, THROUGH BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, REPAY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AND TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF FUNDS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN ISSUANCES OF DEBT AND EQUITY. MORE RECENTLY, WE HAVE AND MAY CONTINUE TO FUND A PORTION OF OUR CASH NEEDS THROUGH REPAYMENTS AND OPPORTUNISTIC SALES OF OUR EXISTING INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. WE MAY ALSO SECURITIZE A PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN UNSECURED OR SENIOR SECURED LOANS OR OTHER ASSETS. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO PUT IN PLACE SUCH BORROWINGS IN ORDER TO ENABLE US TO EXPAND OUR PORTFOLIO.

WHEN OUR COMMON STOCK IS ISSUED, THE RELATED OFFERING EXPENSES HAVE BEEN CHARGED AGAINST PAID-IN CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF PAR. ALL UNDERWRITING FEES AND OFFERING EXPENSES WERE BORNE BY US.  AS PART OF OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE DELIVERED A NOTICE  WITH OUR ANNUAL PROXY MAILING ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2019.  WE DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  OR  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

UNDER THE 1940 ACT, ASC 946, AND THE REGULATIONS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 6 OF REGULATION S-X, WE ARE PRECLUDED FROM CONSOLIDATING ANY ENTITY OTHER THAN ANOTHER INVESTMENT COMPANY OR AN OPERATING COMPANY WHICH PROVIDES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS SERVICES TO BENEFIT US. OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF PROSPECT, PCF, PSBL, PYC, AND THE CONSOLIDATED HOLDING COMPANIES. ALL INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION. THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OUR NON-SUBSTANTIALLY WHOLLY OWNED HOLDING COMPANIES AND OPERATING PORTFOLIO COMPANY INVESTMENTS ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ANY OPERATING COMPANIES OWNED BY THE CONSOLIDATED HOLDING COMPANIES ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED.  RECLASSIFICATIONS  CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PRESENTATION OF PRIOR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO CONFORM TO THE PRESENTATION AS OF AND FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  USE OF ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF INCOME, EXPENSES, AND GAINS AND LOSSES DURING THE REPORTED PERIOD. CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, FINANCIAL MARKETS, CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE ISSUERS OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ANY OTHER PARAMETERS USED IN DETERMINING THESE ESTIMATES COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER, AND THESE DIFFERENCES COULD BE MATERIAL.  INVESTMENT CLASSIFICATION  WE ARE A NON-DIVERSIFIED COMPANY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE 1940 ACT. AS REQUIRED BY THE 1940 ACT, WE CLASSIFY OUR INVESTMENTS BY LEVEL OF CONTROL. AS DEFINED IN THE 1940 ACT, \u201cCONTROL INVESTMENTS\u201d ARE THOSE WHERE THERE IS THE ABILITY OR POWER TO EXERCISE A CONTROLLING INFLUENCE OVER THE MANAGEMENT OR POLICIES OF A COMPANY. CONTROL IS GENERALLY DEEMED TO EXIST WHEN A COMPANY OR INDIVIDUAL POSSESSES OR HAS THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE WITHIN 60 DAYS OR LESS, A BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF MORE THAN 25% OF THE VOTING SECURITIES OF AN INVESTEE COMPANY. UNDER THE 1940 ACT, \u201cAFFILIATE INVESTMENTS\u201d ARE DEFINED BY A LESSER DEGREE OF INFLUENCE AND ARE DEEMED TO EXIST THROUGH THE POSSESSION OUTRIGHT OR VIA THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE WITHIN 60 DAYS OR LESS, BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF 5% OR MORE OF THE OUTSTANDING VOTING SECURITIES OF ANOTHER PERSON. \u201cNON-CONTROL/NON-AFFILIATE INVESTMENTS\u201d ARE THOSE THAT ARE NEITHER CONTROL INVESTMENTS NOR AFFILIATE INVESTMENTS.  AS A BDC, WE MUST NOT ACQUIRE ANY ASSETS OTHER THAN \u201cQUALIFYING ASSETS\u201d SPECIFIED IN THE 1940 ACT UNLESS, AT THE TIME THE ACQUISITION IS MADE, AT LEAST 70% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS ARE QUALIFYING ASSETS (WITH CERTAIN LIMITED EXCEPTIONS).  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2019  , OUR QUALIFYING ASSETS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ASSETS, STOOD AT  73.04%  AND  73.85%  , RESPECTIVELY.  INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS  INVESTMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN WE ASSUME AN OBLIGATION TO ACQUIRE A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT AND ASSUME THE RISKS FOR GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THAT INSTRUMENT. SPECIFICALLY, WE RECORD ALL SECURITY TRANSACTIONS ON A TRADE DATE BASIS. INVESTMENTS ARE DERECOGNIZED WHEN WE ASSUME AN OBLIGATION TO SELL A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT AND FOREGO THE RISKS FOR GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THAT INSTRUMENT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 325-40,  BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS  , INVESTMENTS IN CLOS ARE PERIODICALLY ASSESSED FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT (\u201cOTTI\u201d). WHEN THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT A CLO HAS OTTI, THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE CLO IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE AS OF THE DATE OF THE DETERMINATION BASED ON EVENTS AND INFORMATION EVALUATED AND THAT WRITE-DOWN IS RECOGNIZED AS A REALIZED LOSS. AMOUNTS FOR INVESTMENTS TRADED BUT NOT YET SETTLED ARE REPORTED IN DUE TO BROKER OR DUE FROM BROKER, IN THE  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  FOREIGN CURRENCY  FOREIGN CURRENCY AMOUNTS ARE TRANSLATED INTO  US DOLLARS (USD)  ON THE FOLLOWING BASIS.  I.  FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\u2014AT THE SPOT EXCHANGE RATE ON THE LAST BUSINESS DAY OF THE PERIOD; AND  130  II.  PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, INCOME AND EXPENSES\u2014AT THE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING ON THE RESPECTIVE DATES OF SUCH INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS, INCOME OR EXPENSES.  WE DO NOT ISOLATE THAT PORTION OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON INVESTMENTS FROM THE FLUCTUATIONS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF INVESTMENTS HELD OR DISPOSED OF DURING THE PERIOD. SUCH FLUCTUATIONS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE NET REALIZED AND NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES FROM INVESTMENTS IN THE  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  INVESTMENT RISKS  OUR INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS. THOSE RISKS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  MARKET RISK  MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS THAT CAN BE CAUSED BY A CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.  CREDIT RISK  CREDIT RISK REPRESENTS THE RISK THAT WE WOULD INCUR IF THE COUNTERPARTIES FAILED TO PERFORM PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THEIR AGREEMENTS WITH US.  LIQUIDITY RISK  LIQUIDITY RISK REPRESENTS THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAPIDLY ADJUST THE SIZE OF OUR INVESTMENT POSITIONS IN TIMES OF HIGH VOLATILITY AND FINANCIAL STRESS AT A REASONABLE PRICE.  INTEREST RATE RISK  INTEREST RATE RISK REPRESENTS A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INTEREST-BEARING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.  PREPAYMENT RISK  MANY OF OUR DEBT INVESTMENTS ALLOW FOR PREPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL WITHOUT PENALTY. DOWNWARD CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES MAY CAUSE PREPAYMENTS TO OCCUR AT A FASTER THAN EXPECTED RATE, THEREBY EFFECTIVELY SHORTENING THE MATURITY OF THE SECURITY AND MAKING US LESS LIKELY TO FULLY EARN ALL OF THE EXPECTED INCOME OF THAT SECURITY AND REINVESTING IN A LOWER YIELDING INSTRUMENT.  STRUCTURED CREDIT RELATED RISK  CLO INVESTMENTS MAY BE RISKIER AND LESS TRANSPARENT TO US THAN DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN UNDERLYING COMPANIES. CLOS TYPICALLY WILL HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OTHER THAN THEIR UNDERLYING SENIOR SECURED LOANS. THEREFORE, PAYMENTS ON CLO INVESTMENTS ARE AND WILL BE PAYABLE SOLELY FROM THE CASH FLOWS FROM SUCH SENIOR SECURED LOANS.  ONLINE SMALL-AND-MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESS LENDING RISK  WITH RESPECT TO OUR ONLINE SMALL-AND-MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESS (\u201cSME\u201d) LENDING INITIATIVE, WE INVEST PRIMARILY IN MARKETPLACE LOANS THROUGH MARKETPLACE LENDING PLATFORMS (E.G. ONDECK). WE DO NOT CONDUCT LOAN ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES OURSELVES. THEREFORE, OUR ABILITY TO PURCHASE SME LOANS, AND OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR PORTFOLIO OF SME LOANS, IS DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY THE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND COMPETITIVENESS OF THE MARKETPLACE LOAN ORIGINATION BUSINESS OF THE MARKETPLACE LENDING PLATFORMS FROM WHICH WE PURCHASE SME LOANS. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ANALYZE THE RISK-RETURN PROFILE OF SME LOANS IS SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON THE MARKETPLACE PLATFORMS\u2019 ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE A BORROWER'S CREDIT PROFILE AND LIKELIHOOD OF DEFAULT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE BORROWERS' CREDIT PROFILES OR THE CREDIT DECISIONING AND SCORING MODELS IMPLEMENTED BY EACH PLATFORM, WE MAY INCUR UNANTICIPATED LOSSES WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  FOREIGN CURRENCY  INVESTMENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS MAY INVOLVE CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS NOT TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE OF DOMESTIC ORIGIN. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND REVALUATIONS AND FUTURE ADVERSE POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, WHICH COULD CAUSE INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN MARKETS TO BE LESS LIQUID AND PRICES MORE VOLATILE THAN THOSE OF COMPARABLE U.S. COMPANIES OR U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES.  131  INVESTMENT VALUATION  TO VALUE OUR INVESTMENTS, WE FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE OF ASC 820,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  (\u201cASC 820\u201d), THAT DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP, AND REQUIRES DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 820, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IS DEFINED AS THE PRICE THAT WE WOULD RECEIVE UPON SELLING AN INVESTMENT IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION TO AN INDEPENDENT BUYER IN THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET IN WHICH THAT INVESTMENT IS TRANSACTED.  ASC 820 CLASSIFIES THE INPUTS USED TO MEASURE THESE FAIR VALUES INTO THE FOLLOWING HIERARCHY.  LEVEL 1  : QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, ACCESSIBLE BY US AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.  LEVEL 2  : QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, OR QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, OR OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES.  LEVEL 3  : UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.  IN ALL CASES, THE LEVEL IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WITHIN WHICH THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY FALLS HAS BEEN DETERMINED BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A PARTICULAR INPUT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY REQUIRES JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS FACTORS SPECIFIC TO EACH INVESTMENT.  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES FOR THE VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THESE PROCEDURES ARE DETAILED BELOW.  INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE READILY AVAILABLE ARE VALUED AT SUCH MARKET QUOTATIONS.  FOR MOST OF OUR INVESTMENTS, MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE. WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE OR WHEN SUCH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE DEEMED NOT TO REPRESENT FAIR VALUE, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED A MULTI-STEP VALUATION PROCESS EACH QUARTER, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.  1.  EACH PORTFOLIO COMPANY OR INVESTMENT IS REVIEWED BY OUR INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS WITH INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRMS ENGAGED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  2.  THE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRMS PREPARE INDEPENDENT VALUATIONS FOR EACH INVESTMENT BASED ON THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENTS AND ISSUE THEIR REPORT.  3.  THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEWS AND DISCUSSES WITH THE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRMS THE VALUATION REPORTS, AND THEN MAKES A RECOMMENDATION TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE VALUE FOR EACH INVESTMENT.  4.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSES VALUATIONS AND DETERMINES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH INVESTMENT IN OUR PORTFOLIO IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON THE INPUT OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISER, THE RESPECTIVE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE.  OUR NON-CLO INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED UTILIZING A YIELD TECHNIQUE, ENTERPRISE VALUE (\u201cEV\u201d) TECHNIQUE, NET ASSET VALUE TECHNIQUE, LIQUIDATION TECHNIQUE, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUE, OR A COMBINATION OF TECHNIQUES, AS APPROPRIATE. THE YIELD TECHNIQUE USES LOAN SPREADS FOR LOANS AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION IMPLIED BY MARKET DATA INVOLVING IDENTICAL OR COMPARABLE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. UNDER THE EV TECHNIQUE, THE EV OF A PORTFOLIO COMPANY IS FIRST DETERMINED AND ALLOCATED OVER THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY\u2019S SECURITIES IN ORDER OF THEIR PREFERENCE RELATIVE TO ONE ANOTHER (I.E., \u201cWATERFALL\u201d ALLOCATION). TO DETERMINE THE EV, WE TYPICALLY USE A MARKET (MULTIPLES) VALUATION APPROACH THAT CONSIDERS RELEVANT AND APPLICABLE MARKET TRADING DATA OF GUIDELINE PUBLIC COMPANIES, TRANSACTION METRICS FROM PRECEDENT MERGER AND ACQUISITIONS TRANSACTIONS, AND/OR A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUE. THE NET ASSET VALUE TECHNIQUE, AN INCOME APPROACH, IS USED TO DERIVE A VALUE OF AN UNDERLYING INVESTMENT (SUCH AS REAL ESTATE PROPERTY) BY DIVIDING A RELEVANT EARNINGS STREAM BY AN APPROPRIATE CAPITALIZATION RATE. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE CONSIDER CAPITALIZATION RATES FOR SIMILAR PROPERTIES AS MAY BE OBTAINED FROM GUIDELINE PUBLIC COMPANIES AND/OR RELEVANT TRANSACTIONS. THE LIQUIDATION TECHNIQUE IS INTENDED TO APPROXIMATE THE NET RECOVERY VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING LIQUIDATION PROCEEDS BASED ON A HYPOTHETICAL LIQUIDATION OF A PORTFOLIO COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUE CONVERTS FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR EARNINGS TO A RANGE OF FAIR VALUES FROM WHICH A SINGLE ESTIMATE MAY BE DERIVED UTILIZING AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IS BASED ON THE NET PRESENT VALUE INDICATED BY CURRENT MARKET EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THOSE FUTURE AMOUNTS.  IN APPLYING THESE METHODOLOGIES, ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT WE CONSIDER IN VALUING OUR INVESTMENTS MAY INCLUDE, AS WE DEEM RELEVANT: SECURITY COVENANTS, CALL PROTECTION PROVISIONS, AND INFORMATION RIGHTS; THE NATURE AND REALIZABLE VALUE OF ANY COLLATERAL; THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS; THE PRINCIPAL MARKETS IN WHICH THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY DOES BUSINESS; PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FINANCIAL RATIOS OF PEER COMPANIES; THE PRINCIPAL MARKET; AND ENTERPRISE VALUES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.  132  OUR INVESTMENTS IN CLOS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASURED SECURITIES UNDER ASC 820 AND ARE VALUED USING A DISCOUNTED MULTI-PATH CASH FLOW MODEL. THE CLO STRUCTURES ARE ANALYZED TO IDENTIFY THE RISK EXPOSURES AND TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE CALL DATE (I.E., EXPECTED MATURITY). THESE RISK FACTORS ARE SENSITIZED IN THE MULTI-PATH CASH FLOW MODEL USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS, WHICH IS A SIMULATION USED TO MODEL THE PROBABILITY OF DIFFERENT OUTCOMES, TO GENERATE PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED (I.E., MULTI-PATH) CASH FLOWS FROM THE UNDERLYING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  THESE CASH FLOWS ARE DISCOUNTED USING APPROPRIATE MARKET DISCOUNT RATES, AND RELEVANT DATA IN THE CLO MARKET AS WELL AS CERTAIN BENCHMARK CREDIT INDICES ARE CONSIDERED, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF EACH CLO INVESTMENT.  IN ADDITION, WE GENERATE A SINGLE-PATH CASH FLOW UTILIZING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED CASH RECEIPTS, AND ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE IMPLIED DISCOUNT RATE THAT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE VALUE DERIVED FROM THE MULTI-PATH CASH FLOWS.  WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND HAVE NO INFLUENCE OVER THE ASSET MANAGEMENT OF THE PORTFOLIOS UNDERLYING THE CLO INVESTMENTS WE HOLD, AS THOSE PORTFOLIOS ARE MANAGED BY NON-AFFILIATED THIRD-PARTY CLO COLLATERAL MANAGERS. THE MAIN RISK FACTORS ARE DEFAULT RISK, PREPAYMENT RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, DOWNGRADE RISK, AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK.  VALUATION OF OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES  ASC 825,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  , SPECIFICALLY ASC 825-10-25, PERMITS AN ENTITY TO CHOOSE, AT SPECIFIED ELECTION DATES, TO MEASURE ELIGIBLE ITEMS AT FAIR VALUE (THE \u201cFAIR VALUE OPTION\u201d). WE HAVE NOT ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION TO REPORT SELECTED FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES.  SEE NOTE 8 IN THE ACCOMPANYING  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR THE DISCLOSURE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT AND THE MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE.  CONVERTIBLE NOTES  WE HAVE RECORDED THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES AT THEIR CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTIONS IN THE CONVERTIBLE UNSECURED NOTES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE SEPARATELY ACCOUNTED FOR AS A DERIVATIVE UNDER ASC 815,  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING.  SEE NOTE 5 IN THE ACCOMPANYING  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS ARE CALCULATED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.  INTEREST INCOME, ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUM AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNT, IS RECORDED ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS. LOAN ORIGINATION FEES, ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT, AND MARKET DISCOUNTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND ACCRETED INTO INTEREST INCOME OVER THE RESPECTIVE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE LOANS USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD OR STRAIGHT-LINE, AS APPLICABLE, AND ADJUSTED ONLY FOR MATERIAL AMENDMENTS OR PREPAYMENTS. UPON A PREPAYMENT OF A LOAN, PREPAYMENT PREMIUMS, ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT, OR MARKET DISCOUNTS ARE RECORDED AS INTEREST INCOME.  LOANS ARE PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS WHEN THERE IS REASONABLE DOUBT THAT PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST WILL BE COLLECTED. UNPAID ACCRUED INTEREST IS GENERALLY REVERSED WHEN A LOAN IS PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS. INTEREST PAYMENTS RECEIVED ON NON-ACCRUAL LOANS ARE EITHER APPLIED TO THE COST BASIS OR INTEREST INCOME, DEPENDING UPON MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT OF THE COLLECTIBILITY OF THE LOAN RECEIVABLE. NON-ACCRUAL LOANS ARE RESTORED TO ACCRUAL STATUS WHEN PAST DUE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS PAID AND IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT, IS LIKELY TO REMAIN CURRENT AND FUTURE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST COLLECTIONS WHEN DUE ARE PROBABLE. INTEREST RECEIVED AND APPLIED AGAINST COST WHILE A LOAN IS ON NON-ACCRUAL, AND PIK INTEREST CAPITALIZED BUT NOT RECOGNIZED WHILE ON NON-ACCRUAL, IS RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY ON THE EFFECTIVE YIELD BASIS THROUGH MATURITY OF THE LOAN WHEN PLACED BACK ON ACCRUAL STATUS, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED COLLECTIBLE BY MANAGEMENT. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY  2.4%  OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE ARE IN NON-ACCRUAL STATUS.  SOME OF OUR LOANS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS MAY HAVE CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT-IN-KIND (\u201cPIK\u201d) INTEREST OR DIVIDENDS. PIK INCOME COMPUTED AT THE CONTRACTUAL RATE IS ACCRUED INTO INCOME AND REFLECTED AS RECEIVABLE UP TO THE CAPITALIZATION DATE. PIK INVESTMENTS OFFER ISSUERS THE OPTION AT EACH PAYMENT DATE OF MAKING PAYMENTS IN CASH OR IN ADDITIONAL SECURITIES. WHEN ADDITIONAL SECURITIES ARE RECEIVED, THEY TYPICALLY HAVE THE SAME TERMS, INCLUDING MATURITY DATES AND INTEREST RATES AS THE ORIGINAL SECURITIES ISSUED. ON THESE PAYMENT DATES, WE CAPITALIZE THE ACCRUED INTEREST (REFLECTING SUCH AMOUNTS IN THE BASIS AS ADDITIONAL SECURITIES RECEIVED). PIK GENERALLY BECOMES DUE AT MATURITY OF THE INVESTMENT OR UPON THE INVESTMENT BEING CALLED BY THE ISSUER. AT THE POINT THAT WE BELIEVE PIK IS NOT FULLY EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED, THE PIK INVESTMENT WILL BE PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS. WHEN A PIK INVESTMENT IS PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS, THE ACCRUED, UNCAPITALIZED INTEREST OR DIVIDENDS ARE REVERSED FROM THE RELATED RECEIVABLE THROUGH INTEREST OR DIVIDEND INCOME, RESPECTIVELY. WE DO NOT REVERSE PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED PIK INTEREST OR DIVIDENDS. UPON CAPITALIZATION, PIK IS SUBJECT TO THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR RELATED INVESTMENTS. PIK INVESTMENTS ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS ARE RESTORED TO ACCRUAL STATUS IF WE BELIEVE THAT PIK IS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED.  INTEREST INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS IN SUBORDINATED STRUCTURED NOTES (TYPICALLY PREFERRED SHARES, INCOME NOTES OR SUBORDINATED NOTES OF CLO FUNDS) AND \u201cEQUITY\u201d CLASS OF SECURITY OF SECURITIZED TRUST IS RECORDED BASED UPON AN ESTIMATION OF AN EFFECTIVE YIELD TO EXPECTED MATURITY UTILIZING ASSUMED CASH FLOWS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 325-40,  BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL  133  ASSETS  . WE MONITOR THE EXPECTED CASH INFLOWS FROM OUR CLO AND SECURITIZED TRUST EQUITY INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING THE EXPECTED RESIDUAL PAYMENTS, AND THE EFFECTIVE YIELD IS DETERMINED AND UPDATED PERIODICALLY.  DIVIDEND INCOME IS RECORDED ON THE EX-DIVIDEND DATE.  OTHER INCOME GENERALLY INCLUDES AMENDMENT FEES, COMMITMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES AND STRUCTURING FEES WHICH ARE RECORDED WHEN EARNED. EXCESS DEAL DEPOSITS, NET PROFITS INTERESTS AND OVERRIDING ROYALTY INTERESTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME.  SEE NOTE 10 IN THE ACCOMPANYING  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES  WE HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A  RIC  AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CODE APPLICABLE TO REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANIES. WE ARE REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE AT LEAST 90% OF OUR INVESTMENT COMPANY TAXABLE INCOME AND INTEND TO DISTRIBUTE (OR RETAIN THROUGH A DEEMED DISTRIBUTION) ALL OF OUR INVESTMENT COMPANY TAXABLE INCOME AND NET CAPITAL GAIN TO STOCKHOLDERS; THEREFORE, WE HAVE MADE NO PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THE CHARACTER OF INCOME AND GAINS THAT WE WILL DISTRIBUTE IS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH INCOME TAX REGULATIONS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM GAAP. BOOK AND TAX BASIS DIFFERENCES RELATING TO STOCKHOLDER DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER PERMANENT BOOK AND TAX DIFFERENCES ARE RECLASSIFIED TO PAID-IN CAPITAL.  IF WE DO NOT DISTRIBUTE (OR ARE NOT DEEMED TO HAVE DISTRIBUTED) AT LEAST 98% OF OUR ANNUAL ORDINARY INCOME AND 98.2% OF OUR CAPITAL GAINS IN THE CALENDAR YEAR EARNED, WE WILL GENERALLY BE REQUIRED TO PAY AN EXCISE TAX EQUAL TO 4% OF THE AMOUNT BY WHICH 98% OF OUR ANNUAL ORDINARY INCOME AND 98.2% OF OUR CAPITAL GAINS EXCEED THE DISTRIBUTIONS FROM SUCH TAXABLE INCOME FOR THE YEAR. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DETERMINE THAT OUR ESTIMATED CURRENT YEAR ANNUAL TAXABLE INCOME WILL BE IN EXCESS OF ESTIMATED CURRENT YEAR DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM SUCH TAXABLE INCOME, WE ACCRUE EXCISE TAXES, IF ANY, ON ESTIMATED EXCESS TAXABLE INCOME. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE ANY EXCISE TAX DUE FOR THE 2019 CALENDAR YEAR. THUS, WE HAVE NOT ACCRUED ANY EXCISE TAX FOR THIS PERIOD.  IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY THE ANNUAL DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT OR OTHERWISE FAIL TO QUALIFY AS A RIC IN ANY TAXABLE YEAR, WE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO TAX ON ALL OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME AT REGULAR CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATES. WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DEDUCT DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS, NOR WOULD WE BE REQUIRED TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS. DISTRIBUTIONS WOULD GENERALLY BE TAXABLE TO OUR INDIVIDUAL AND OTHER NON-CORPORATE TAXABLE STOCKHOLDERS AS ORDINARY DIVIDEND INCOME ELIGIBLE FOR THE REDUCED MAXIMUM RATE APPLICABLE TO QUALIFIED DIVIDEND INCOME TO THE EXTENT OF OUR CURRENT AND ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS, PROVIDED CERTAIN HOLDING PERIOD AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS UNDER THE CODE, CORPORATE DISTRIBUTIONS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED DEDUCTION. TO QUALIFY AGAIN TO BE TAXED AS A RIC IN A SUBSEQUENT YEAR, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS OUR ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-RIC YEARS. IN ADDITION, IF WE FAILED TO QUALIFY AS A RIC FOR A PERIOD GREATER THAN TWO TAXABLE YEARS, THEN, IN ORDER TO QUALIFY AS A RIC IN A SUBSEQUENT YEAR, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ELECT TO RECOGNIZE AND PAY TAX ON ANY NET BUILT-IN GAIN (THE EXCESS OF AGGREGATE GAIN, INCLUDING ITEMS OF INCOME, OVER AGGREGATE LOSS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REALIZED IF WE HAD BEEN LIQUIDATED) OR, ALTERNATIVELY, BE SUBJECT TO TAXATION ON SUCH BUILT-IN GAIN RECOGNIZED FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS.  WE FOLLOW ASC 740,  INCOME TAXES  (\u201cASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR HOW UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED, MEASURED, PRESENTED, AND DISCLOSED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ASC 740 REQUIRES THE EVALUATION OF TAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN THE COURSE OF PREPARING OUR TAX RETURNS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TAX POSITIONS ARE \u201cMORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT\u201d OF BEING SUSTAINED BY THE APPLICABLE TAX AUTHORITY. TAX POSITIONS NOT DEEMED TO MEET THE MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THRESHOLD ARE RECORDED AS A TAX BENEFIT OR EXPENSE IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE DID NOT RECORD ANY UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OR LIABILITIES. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DETERMINATIONS REGARDING ASC 740 MAY BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND ADJUSTMENT AT A LATER DATE BASED UPON FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AN ON-GOING ANALYSIS OF TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF. ALTHOUGH WE FILE BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS, OUR MAJOR TAX JURISDICTION IS FEDERAL. OUR FEDERAL TAX RETURNS FOR THE TAX YEARS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016 AND THEREAFTER REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE.  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS ARE RECORDED ON THE EX-DIVIDEND DATE. THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, TO BE PAID AS A MONTHLY DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION IS APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS QUARTERLY AND IS GENERALLY BASED UPON OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATE OF OUR FUTURE TAXABLE EARNINGS. NET REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, ARE DISTRIBUTED AT LEAST ANNUALLY.  FINANCING COSTS  WE RECORD ORIGINATION EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE UNSECURED NOTES AS DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS. THESE EXPENSES ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED AS PART OF INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE STATED LIFE OF THE OBLIGATION FOR OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE SAME METHODOLOGY IS USED TO APPROXIMATE THE EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD FOR OUR  134  PROSPECT CAPITAL INTERNOTES\u00ae AND OUR 2024, 2028, AND 2029 NOTES FOLLOW-ON PROGRAMS.  THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD IS USED TO AMORTIZE DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS FOR OUR REMAINING UNSECURED NOTES OVER THE RESPECTIVE EXPECTED LIFE OR MATURITY. IN THE EVENT THAT WE MODIFY OR EXTINGUISH OUR DEBT BEFORE MATURITY, WE FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE IN ASC 470-50,  MODIFICATION AND EXTINGUISHMENTS  (\u201cASC 470-50\u201d). FOR MODIFICATIONS TO OR EXCHANGES OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, ANY UNAMORTIZED DEFERRED COSTS RELATING TO LENDERS WHO ARE NOT PART OF THE NEW LENDING GROUP ARE EXPENSED. FOR EXTINGUISHMENTS OF OUR UNSECURED NOTES, ANY UNAMORTIZED DEFERRED COSTS ARE DEDUCTED FROM THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE DEBT IN DETERMINING THE GAIN OR LOSS FROM THE EXTINGUISHMENT.  UNAMORTIZED DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS ARE PRESENTED AS A DIRECT DEDUCTION TO THE RESPECTIVE UNSECURED NOTES  (SEE NOTES 5, 6, AND 7 IN THE ACCOMPANYING  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION).  WE MAY RECORD REGISTRATION EXPENSES RELATED TO SHELF FILINGS AS PREPAID EXPENSES. THESE EXPENSES CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF SEC REGISTRATION FEES, LEGAL FEES AND ACCOUNTING FEES INCURRED. THESE PREPAID EXPENSES ARE CHARGED TO CAPITAL UPON THE RECEIPT OF PROCEEDS FROM AN EQUITY OFFERING OR CHARGED TO EXPENSE IF NO OFFERING IS COMPLETED. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2019  , THERE ARE NO PREPAID EXPENSES RELATED TO REGISTRATION EXPENSES AND ALL AMOUNTS INCURRED HAVE BEEN EXPENSED.  GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS  WE FOLLOW ASC 460,  GUARANTEES  (\u201cASC 460\u201d). ASC 460 ELABORATES ON THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF A GUARANTOR IN ITS INTERIM AND ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ABOUT ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN GUARANTEES THAT IT HAS ISSUED. IT ALSO REQUIRES A GUARANTOR TO RECOGNIZE, AT THE INCEPTION OF A GUARANTEE, FOR THOSE GUARANTEES THAT ARE COVERED BY ASC 460, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION UNDERTAKEN IN ISSUING CERTAIN GUARANTEES.  PER SHARE INFORMATION  NET INCREASE OR DECREASE IN NET ASSETS RESULTING FROM OPERATIONS PER SHARE IS CALCULATED USING THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD PRESENTED. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 946, CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES ARE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE CALCULATION OF NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-13,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS-CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326): MEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d), WHICH AMENDS THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IMPAIRMENT GUIDANCE SO THAT AN ENTITY IS REQUIRED TO MEASURE EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT CONDITIONS AND REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE FORECASTS. AS SUCH, AN ENTITY WILL USE FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION TO ESTIMATE CREDIT LOSSES. ASU 2016-13 ALSO AMENDS THE GUIDANCE IN FASB ASC SUBTOPIC NO. 325-40,  INVESTMENTS-OTHER, BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS  , RELATED TO THE SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT OF ACCRETABLE YIELD RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS UNDER THE EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD. ASU 2016-13 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED AS OF THE FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF ADOPTING THIS ASU ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-13,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820)  .  DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK\u2014CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.  THE STANDARD WILL MODIFY THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS BY REMOVING, MODIFYING, OR ADDING CERTAIN DISCLOSURES. ASU NO. 2018-13 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THAT REPORTING PERIOD. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED UPON ISSUANCE OF THIS ASU. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING THIS ASU ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  SEC DISCLOSURE UPDATE AND SIMPLIFICATION  IN AUGUST 2018, THE SEC ADOPTED THE FINAL RULE UNDER SEC RELEASE NO. 33-10532,  DISCLOSURE UPDATE AND SIMPLIFICATION  , AMENDING CERTAIN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE REDUNDANT, DUPLICATIVE, OVERLAPPING, OUTDATED OR SUPERSEDED. THE AMENDMENTS ARE INTENDED TO FACILITATE THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO INVESTORS AND SIMPLIFY COMPLIANCE. WE HAVE ADOPTED THE AMENDMENTS AND HAVE RETROSPECTIVELY APPLIED THE PRESENTATION AMENDMENTS TO THE PRIOR PERIOD STATEMENTS PRESENTED.  PRIOR TO ADOPTION AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH PREVIOUS SEC RULES, WE PRESENTED DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS (LOSS) ON THE  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  , AS THREE COMPONENTS: 1) ACCUMULATED OVERDISTRIBUTED NET INVESTMENT INCOME; 2) ACCUMULATED NET UNREALIZED GAIN (LOSS) ON INVESTMENTS; AND 3) ACCUMULATED NET REALIZED GAIN (LOSS) ON INVESTMENTS. WE ALSO PRESENTED DISTRIBUTIONS FROM EARNINGS ON THE  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN NET ASSETS  AS DISTRIBUTIONS FROM NET INVESTMENT INCOME. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SEC RELEASE, DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS AND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS ARE SHOWN IN TOTAL ON THE  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  AND  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN NET ASSETS  , RESPECTIVELY.  135  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES THE RECONCILIATION OF THE COMPONENTS OF DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS (LOSS) TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTATION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

THE TAX ACT ALSO AUTHORIZES THE IRS TO ISSUE REGULATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE NEW PROVISIONS. WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW THE CHANGES IN THE TAX ACT, OR REGULATIONS OR OTHER GUIDANCE ISSUED UNDER IT, MIGHT AFFECT US, OUR BUSINESS OR THE BUSINESS OF OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. HOWEVER, OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES MAY OR MAY NOT MAKE CERTAIN ELECTIONS UNDER THE TAX ACT THAT COULD MATERIALLY INCREASE THEIR TAXABLE EARNINGS AND PROFITS.

WE ALSO HAVE A DEDICATED BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT TEAM FOCUSED ON GENERATING ENGAGEMENTS WITH NEW CLIENTS TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR CLIENT BASE AND, OVER TIME, REDUCE CLIENT CONCENTRATION.  \u200b  WE DERIVE OUR REVENUE FROM TWO TYPES OF SERVICE OFFERINGS: APPLICATION OUTSOURCING, WHICH IS RECURRING IN NATURE; AND CONSULTING, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION, WHICH IS NON-RECURRING IN NATURE. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR APPLICATION OUTSOURCING AND CONSULTING REVENUE REPRESENTED 55% AND 45%, RESPECTIVELY OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE AS COMPARED TO 53% AND 47%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR APPLICATION OUTSOURCING AND CONSULTING REVENUE REPRESENTED 56% AND 44%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE AS COMPARED TO 53% AND 47%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  \u200b  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR NORTH AMERICA REVENUE INCREASED BY 11.0%, OR $24.0 MILLION, TO $242.3 MILLION, OR 73.8% OF TOTAL REVENUE, FROM $218.3 MILLION, OR 71.5% OF TOTAL REVENUE, IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

THE INCREASE IN NORTH AMERICA REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM CLIENTS IN THE C&T INDUSTRY GROUP, INCLUDING CUSTOMER CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS ACQUIRED FROM THIRD PARTIES.  \u200b  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR EUROPEAN REVENUE DECREASED BY 5.6%, OR $3.4 MILLION, TO $57.0 MILLION, OR 17.4% OF TOTAL REVENUE, FROM $60.4 MILLION, OR 19.8% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

THE DECREASE IN EUROPEAN REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM ONE OF OUR LARGE BANKING CLIENTS AND THE SUBSTANTIAL DEPRECIATION IN THE GBP AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR.  \u200b  OUR GROSS PROFIT INCREASED BY $0.7 MILLION TO $89.9 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO $89.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. OUR GROSS PROFIT INCREASED BY $1.5 MILLION TO $174.2 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $172.7 MILLION IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ONSITE EFFORT AND SUBCONTRACTOR COSTS. AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, GROSS MARGIN WAS 27.4% AND 29.2% IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, GROSS MARGIN, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, WAS 26.9% AND 28.5%, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN DURING THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ONSITE EFFORT, AN INCREASE IN SUBCONTRACTORS COST AND LOWER UTILIZATION.  WE PERFORM OUR SERVICES UNDER BOTH TIME-AND-MATERIALS AND FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS. REVENUE FROM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS REPRESENTED 39% AND 40% OF TOTAL REVENUE, AND REVENUE FROM TIME-AND-MATERIALS CONTRACTS REPRESENTED 61% AND 60% OF TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. REVENUE FROM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS REPRESENTED 40% AND 40% OF TOTAL REVENUE AND REVENUE FROM TIME-AND-MATERIALS CONTRACTS REPRESENTED 60% AND  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  60% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE REVENUE EARNED FROM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS IN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 PRIMARILY REFLECTS OUR CLIENT PREFERENCES.  \u200b  AS AN IT SERVICES COMPANY, OUR REVENUE GROWTH IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, DEVELOP, MOTIVATE AND RETAIN SKILLED IT PROFESSIONALS. WE MONITOR OUR OVERALL ATTRITION RATES AND PATTERNS TO ALIGN OUR PEOPLE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY WITH OUR GROWTH OBJECTIVES. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR ATTRITION RATE FOR THE TRAILING 12 MONTHS, WHICH REFLECTS VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY ATTRITION, WAS APPROXIMATELY 25.6%. OUR ATTRITION RATE AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 REFLECTS A HIGHER RATE OF ATTRITION AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE MAJORITY OF OUR ATTRITION OCCURS IN INDIA AND SRI LANKA, AND IS WEIGHTED TOWARDS THE MORE JUNIOR MEMBERS OF OUR STAFF. IN RESPONSE TO HIGHER ATTRITION AND AS PART OF OUR RETENTION STRATEGIES, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT COSTS, WHICH MAY CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER, WE TRY TO ABSORB SUCH COST INCREASES THROUGH PRICE INCREASES OR COST MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES SUCH AS MANAGING DISCRETIONARY COSTS, THE MIX OF PROFESSIONAL STAFF AND UTILIZATION LEVELS AND ACHIEVING OTHER OPERATING EFFICIENCIES. IF OUR ATTRITION RATE INCREASES OR IS SUSTAINED AT HIGHER LEVELS, OUR GROWTH MAY SLOW AND OUR COST OF ATTRACTING AND RETAINING IT PROFESSIONALS COULD INCREASE.  \u200b  WE ENGAGE IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING STRATEGY USING FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNED TO HEDGE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE INDIAN RUPEE AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR AND THE GBP, AS WELL AS THE EURO, THE CANADIAN DOLLAR, THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR AND THE GBP AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHEN CONSOLIDATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE HEDGING PROGRAMS OR HEDGING CONTRACTS WILL BE EFFECTIVE. BECAUSE THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE VOLATILITY IN THE INDIAN RUPEE, GBP AND EURO EXCHANGE RATES, THEY NOT ONLY REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF A STRONGER INDIAN RUPEE, WEAKER GBP, EURO, CANADIAN DOLLAR AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR BUT ALSO COULD REDUCE THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF A WEAKER INDIAN RUPEE ON OUR INDIAN RUPEE EXPENSES OR REDUCE THE IMPACT OF A STRONGER GBP, EURO, CANADIAN DOLLAR AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR ON OUR GBP, EURO, CANADIAN DOLLAR AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR DENOMINATED REVENUES.  \u200b  APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND RISKS  \u200b  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING THE RECOVERABILITY OF TANGIBLE ASSETS, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATES OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, IN PARTICULAR THOSE RELATED TO THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND PROFITS BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, INCOME TAXES, INCLUDING RESERVES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, DEFERRED TAXES AND LIABILITIES, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDING DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND INVESTMENTS. ACTUAL AMOUNTS COULD DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES. OUR MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.

THE INCREASE IN REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM SEVERAL OF OUR TOP TEN CLIENTS, PRIMARILY IN OUR C&T INDUSTRY GROUP, INCLUDING CUSTOMER CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS ACQUIRED FROM THIRD PARTIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN ONE OF OUR LARGE EUROPEAN BANKING CLIENTS, SUBSTANTIAL DEPRECIATION IN THE GBP AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR AND A DECREASE IN OUR M&I INDUSTRY GROUP. REVENUE FROM NORTH AMERICAN CLIENTS IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 INCREASED BY $24.0 MILLION, OR 11.0%, AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, PARTICULARLY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM CLIENTS IN THE C&T INDUSTRY GROUP. REVENUE FROM EUROPEAN CLIENTS DECREASED BY $3.4 MILLION, OR 5.6%, AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM ONE OF OUR LARGE BANKING CLIENTS AND A SUBSTANTIAL DEPRECIATION IN THE GBP AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR.

(THE \u201cADMINISTRATIVE AGENT\u201d) AND THE LENDERS PARTY THERETO (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT\u201d), WHICH AMENDS THE COMPANY\u2019S AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF FEBRUARY 6, 2018, WITH SUCH PARTIES (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCREASE THE REVOLVING COMMITMENTS AVAILABLE TO US UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM $200.0 MILLION TO $275.0 MILLION, REDUCE THE INTEREST RATE MARGINS APPLICABLE TO TERM LOANS AND REVOLVING LOANS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME AND REDUCE THE COMMITMENT FEE PAYABLE BY US TO THE LENDERS IN RESPECT OF UNUSED REVOLVING COMMITMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. WE EXECUTED THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LENDING CAPACITY WHICH WE COULD USE TO FUND THE COMPLETION OF THE POLARIS DELISTING TRANSACTION, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE EXCESS LENDING CAPACITY IN THE EVENT OF FUTURE OPPORTUNISTIC, STRATEGIC, INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT CONTAINS CUSTOMARY TERMS FOR AMENDMENTS OF THIS TYPE, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS.  \u200b  ON AUGUST 5, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF UP TO $30 MILLION OF OUR COMMON STOCK OVER 12 MONTHS FROM THE APPROVAL DATE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PRICE AND OTHER TRADING RESTRICTIONS AS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPANY. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE REPURCHASED 505,565 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK AT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF $36.93 PER SHARE FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $18.7 MILLION.  \u200b  TO STRENGTHEN OUR DIGITAL ENGINEERING CAPABILITIES AND ESTABLISH A SOLID BASE IN SILICON VALLEY, ON MARCH 12, 2018, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF ETOUCH SYSTEMS CORP (\u201cETOUCH US\u201d), AND ITS INDIAN SUBSIDIARY, ETOUCH SYSTEMS (INDIA) PVT. LTD (\u201cETOUCH INDIA,\u201d TOGETHER WITH ETOUCH US, \u201cETOUCH\u201d) FOR APPROXIMATELY $140.0 MILLION IN CASH, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION, WE SET ASIDE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $15.0 MILLION FOR RETENTION BONUSES TO BE PAID TO ETOUCH MANAGEMENT AND KEY EMPLOYEES, IN EQUAL INSTALLMENTS ON THE FIRST AND SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRANSACTION. WE AGREED TO PAY THE PURCHASE PRICE IN THREE TRANCHES, WITH $80.0 MILLION PAID AT CLOSING, $42.5 MILLION ON THE 12-MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSE OF THE TRANSACTION, AND $17.5 MILLION ON THE 18-MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSE OF THE TRANSACTION, SUBJECT IN EACH CASE TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE PAID THE 12-MONTH ANNIVERSARY PURCHASE PRICE PAYMENT OF $42.5 MILLION AND THE RETENTION BONUS AMOUNT OF $7.0 MILLION TO THE ETOUCH MANAGEMENT AND KEY EMPLOYEES.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE PAID THE 18-MONTH ANNIVERSARY PURCHASE PRICE PAYMENT OF $17.5 MILLION.  \u200b  ON MARCH 3, 2016, OUR INDIAN SUBSIDIARY, VIRTUSA CONSULTING SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED (\u201cVIRTUSA INDIA\u201d) ACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY 51.7% OF THE FULLY DILUTED SHARES OF POLARIS CONSULTING & SERVICES LIMITED (\u201cPOLARIS\u201d) FOR APPROXIMATELY $168.3 MILLION IN CASH (THE \u201cPOLARIS TRANSACTION\u201d) PURSUANT TO A SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT DATED AS OF NOVEMBER 5, 2015, BY AND AMONG VIRTUSA INDIA, POLARIS AND THE PROMOTER SELLERS NAMED THEREIN. THROUGH A SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE INDIAN RULES ON TAKEOVERS AND SEBI DELISTING REGULATIONS, VIRTUSA INCREASED ITS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN POLARIS FROM 51.7% TO 93.0% BY FEBRUARY 12, 2018 WHEN VIRTUSA CONSUMMATED ITS POLARIS DELISTING OFFER WITH RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS OF POLARIS. THE DELISTING OFFER RESULTED IN AN ACCEPTED EXIT PRICE OF INR 480 PER SHARE (\u201cEXIT PRICE\u201d), FOR AN AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $145.0 MILLION, EXCLUSIVE OF TRANSACTION AND CLOSING COSTS. ON JULY 11, 2018, THE STOCK EXCHANGES ON WHICH POLARIS COMMON SHARES ARE LISTED NOTIFIED POLARIS THAT TRADING IN EQUITY SHARES OF POLARIS WOULD BE DISCONTINUED AND DELISTED EFFECTIVE ON AUGUST 1, 2018. FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR FOLLOWING THE DATE OF DELISTING, VIRTUSA INDIA WILL, IN COMPLIANCE WITH SEBI DELISTING REGULATIONS, PERMIT THE PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS OF POLARIS TO TENDER THEIR SHARES FOR SALE TO VIRTUSA INDIA AT THE EXIT PRICE. IN CONNECTION WITH THE POLARIS DELISTING OFFER, DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 VIRTUSA INDIA PURCHASED 1,263,117 SHARES, OR 1.2%, OF POLARIS COMMON STOCK FROM POLARIS PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $8.7 MILLION. SUBSEQUENT TO THE EXPIRY OF THE DELISTING OFFER PERIOD ON JULY 31, 2019, WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO REDEEM THE SHARES AND ACCORDINGLY THE REMAINING REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST AMOUNTING TO $15.1 MILLION HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO PERMANENT EQUITY.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u200b  IN CONNECTION WITH, AND AS PART OF THE POLARIS ACQUISITION, ON NOVEMBER 5, 2015, WE ENTERED INTO AN AMENDMENT WITH CITIGROUP TECHNOLOGY, INC. (\u201cCITI\u201d) AND POLARIS, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE UPON THE CLOSING OF THE POLARIS TRANSACTION, PURSUANT TO WHICH VIRTUSA WAS ADDED AS A PARTY TO THE MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH CITI AND CITI AGREED TO APPOINT THE COMPANY AND POLARIS AS A PREFERRED VENDOR.  \u200b  ON FEBRUARY 6, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A $450.0 MILLION CREDIT AGREEMENT (\u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH A SYNDICATED BANK GROUP JOINTLY LEAD BY JP MORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED, WHICH AMENDS AND RESTATES OUR PRIOR $300.0 MILLION CREDIT AGREEMENT (WHICH WE HAD ORIGINALLY ENTERED INTO ON FEBRUARY 25, 2016 (\u201cPRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) TO FUND THE POLARIS ACQUISITION AND CERTAIN RELATED TRANSACTIONS) AND PROVIDES FOR A $200.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, A $180.0 MILLION TERM LOAN FACILITY, AND A $70.0 MILLION DELAYED-DRAW TERM LOAN. WE DREW DOWN $180.0 MILLION UNDER THE TERM LOAN OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND $55.0 MILLION UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT TO REPAY IN FULL THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE PRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND FUND THE POLARIS DELISTING TRANSACTION. TO FUND THE ETOUCH ACQUISITION AND POLARIS DELISTING OFFER, WE DREW DOWN FROM OUR CREDIT FACILITY. INTEREST UNDER THIS NEW CREDIT FACILITY ACCRUES AT A RATE PER ANNUM OF LIBOR PLUS 3.0%, SUBJECT TO STEP-DOWNS BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S RATIO OF DEBT TO EBITDA. WE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO MINIMIZE INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES MAXIMUM DEBT TO EBITDA AND MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE COVENANTS. THE TERM OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS FIVE YEARS, ENDING FEBRUARY 6, 2023 (SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION). FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2020, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO MAKE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF $3.1 MILLION PER QUARTER.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY DREW DOWN $27.5 MILLION FROM THE CREDIT FACILITY TO FUND THE ETOUCH 18-MONTH ANNIVERSARY PAYMENT AND TO FUND THE  OPPORTUNISTIC, STRATEGIC, INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES  . AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE OUTSTANDING AMOUNT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS $388.3 MILLION. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE INTEREST RATE ON THE TERM LOAN AND LINE OF CREDIT WAS 4.53%.  \u200b  THE CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS, INCLUDING ALL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ALL SECURITIES IN DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES (OTHER THAN CERTAIN DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE MATERIAL ASSETS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARIES ARE EQUITY IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES), SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY EXCEPTIONS AND EXCLUSIONS FROM THE COLLATERAL. ALL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S MATERIAL DIRECT AND INDIRECT DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. THESE GUARANTEES ARE SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PRESENT AND FUTURE PROPERTY AND ASSETS OF THE GUARANTORS, WITH CERTAIN EXCLUSIONS.  \u200b  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS DEBT COVENANTS AND HAS PROVIDED A QUARTERLY CERTIFICATION TO OUR LENDERS TO THAT EFFECT. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CURRENTLY MEET ALL CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT TO BORROW THEREUNDER AND WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY CONDITIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT US FROM BORROWING PART OR ALL OF THE REMAINING AVAILABLE CAPACITY UNDER THE EXISTING REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND THROUGH THE DATE OF THIS FILING.  \u200b  ON MAY 3, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO AN INVESTMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE OROGEN GROUP (\u201cOROGEN\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH OROGEN PURCHASED 108,000 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S NEWLY ISSUED SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, INITIALLY CONVERTIBLE INTO 3,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $108 MILLION WITH AN INITIAL CONVERSION PRICE OF $36.00 (THE \u201cOROGEN PREFERRED STOCK FINANCING\u201d). IN CONNECTION WITH THE INVESTMENT, VIKRAM S. PANDIT, THE FORMER CEO OF CITIGROUP, WAS APPOINTED TO VIRTUSA\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OROGEN IS A NEW OPERATING COMPANY THAT WAS CREATED BY VIKRAM PANDIT AND ATAIROS GROUP, INC., AN INDEPENDENT PRIVATE COMPANY FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING GROWTH-ORIENTED BUSINESSES, TO LEVERAGE THE OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY THE EVOLUTION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES LANDSCAPE AND TO IDENTIFY AND INVEST IN FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AND RELATED BUSINESSES WITH PROVEN BUSINESS MODELS.  \u200b  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT, THE SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK HAS A 3.875% DIVIDEND PER ANNUM, PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AND/OR CASH AT OUR OPTION. IF ANY SHARES OF SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK HAVE NOT BEEN CONVERTED INTO COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO MAY 3, 2024, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE SUCH SHARES AT A REPURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO THE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF THE REPURCHASED SHARES PLUS THE AMOUNT OF ACCUMULATED AND UNPAID DIVIDENDS THEREON. IF WE FAIL TO EFFECT SUCH REPURCHASE, THE DIVIDEND RATE ON THE SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK WILL INCREASE BY 1% PER ANNUM AND AN ADDITIONAL 1% PER ANNUM ON EACH ANNIVERSARY OF MAY 3, 2024 DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH FAILURE TO EFFECT THE REPURCHASE IS CONTINUING, EXCEPT THAT THE DIVIDEND RATE WILL NOT INCREASE TO MORE  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THAN 6.875% PER ANNUM. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY PAID $2.1 MILLION AS A CASH DIVIDEND ON ITS SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK.  \u200b  THE COMPANY ALSO USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MITIGATE THE COMPANY\u2019S INTEREST RATE RISK ON THE COMPANY\u2019S VARIABLE RATE DEBT. THE COMPANY\u2019S OBJECTIVE IS TO LIMIT THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN LIBOR INTEREST RATE PAYMENTS DUE ON THE CREDIT AGREEMENT (SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), BY USING PAY-FIXED, RECEIVE-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO OFFSET THE FUTURE VARIABLE RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY PURCHASED INTEREST RATE SWAPS IN JULY 2016 WITH AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF JULY 2017 AND NOVEMBER 2018.  THE JULY 2016 INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE AT A BLENDED WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF 1.025% AND THE COMPANY WILL RECEIVE 1-MONTH LIBOR ON THE SAME NOTIONAL AMOUNTS.  THE NOVEMBER 2018 INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE AT A FIXED RATE OF 2.85% AND ARE DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN A 50% COVERAGE OF OUR LIBOR DEBT, THEREFORE THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT CHANGES OVER THE LIFE OF THE SWAP TO RETAIN THE 50% COVERAGE TARGET.  \u200b  THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS COULD DEMAND AN EARLY TERMINATION OF THE JUNE 2016 AND NOVEMBER 2018 SWAP AGREEMENTS IF WE ARE IN DEFAULT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, OR ANY AGREEMENT THAT AMENDS OR REPLACES THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE COUNTERPARTY IS A MEMBER, AND WE ARE UNABLE TO CURE THE DEFAULT. AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING A MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO COMMENCING ON DECEMBER 31, 2018, OF NOT MORE THAN 3.50 TO 1.00 FOR PERIODS ENDING PRIOR TO DECEMBER 31, 2019, OF NOT MORE THAN 3.25 TO 1.00 COMMENCING DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND FOR PERIODS ENDING PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2020, AND 3.00 TO 1.00 THEREAFTER AND A MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF 1.25 TO 1.00. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS. THE NET UNREALIZED LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT WAS $6.4 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT THAT WE WOULD PAY TO THE COUNTERPARTIES IN THE EVENT OF AN EARLY TERMINATION.  \u200b  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $198.5 MILLION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS AND LONG TERM INVESTMENTS, OF WHICH WE HOLD APPROXIMATELY $172.3 MILLION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN INDIA, SRI LANKA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. CASH IN THESE NON-U.S. LOCATIONS MAY NOT OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE FOR POTENTIAL INVESTMENTS OR OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OR CERTAIN OTHER GEOGRAPHIES WHERE NEEDED, AS WE HAVE STATED THAT THIS CASH IS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN THESE NON-U.S. LOCATIONS. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY PLAN TO REPATRIATE THIS CASH TO THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, IF OUR INTENT WERE TO CHANGE AND WE ELECTED TO REPATRIATE THIS CASH BACK TO THE UNITED STATES, OR THIS CASH WAS DEEMED NO LONGER PERMANENTLY INVESTED, THIS CASH WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL TAXES AND THE CHANGE IN SUCH INTENT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CASH BALANCES AS WELL AS OUR OVERALL STATEMENT OF INCOME. DUE TO VARIOUS METHODS BY WHICH CASH COULD BE REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES IN THE FUTURE, THE AMOUNT OF TAXES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CASH IS DEPENDENT ON CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IF AND WHEN REMITTANCE OCCURS. IN ADDITION, SOME COUNTRIES COULD HAVE TIGHT RESTRICTIONS ON THE MOVEMENT AND EXCHANGE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES WHICH COULD FURTHER LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO USE SUCH FUNDS FOR GLOBAL OPERATIONS OR CAPITAL OR OTHER STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. DUE TO THE VARIOUS METHODS BY WHICH SUCH EARNINGS COULD BE REPATRIATED IN THE FUTURE, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF APPLICABLE TAXES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM SUCH REPATRIATION.  \u200b  FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO ARRANGEMENTS TO DELIVER IT SERVICES THAT INCLUDE UPFRONT PAYMENTS TO OUR CLIENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE TOTAL UNAMORTIZED UPFRONT PAYMENTS RELATED TO THESE SERVICES WERE $36.9 MILLION AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE AMORTIZED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE OVER A BENEFIT PERIOD OF 5 YEARS.  \u200b  BEGINNING IN FISCAL 2009, OUR U.K. SUBSIDIARY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH AN UNRELATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO SELL, WITHOUT RECOURSE, CERTAIN OF ITS EUROPE-BASED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES FROM ONE CLIENT TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE SOLD $16.2 MILLION OF RECEIVABLES UNDER THE TERMS OF THE FINANCING AGREEMENT. FEES PAID PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT WERE NOT MATERIAL DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. NO AMOUNTS WERE DUE UNDER THE FINANCING AGREEMENT AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, BUT WE MAY ELECT TO USE THIS PROGRAM AGAIN IN FUTURE PERIODS. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES THAT THIS OR ANY OTHER FINANCING FACILITIES WILL BE AVAILABLE OR UTILIZED IN THE FUTURE.  \u200b  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAVE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS OF $4.0 MILLION RELATING TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF LAND ACQUIRED IN THE POLARIS ACQUISITION TO HELD FOR SALE. THE DECISION TO SELL THIS LAND WAS MADE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AS PART OF OUR ANNUAL PLANNING PROCESS WHERE WE EVALUATED STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES TO MAXIMIZE RETURN ON OUR CASH AND ASSETS. AS PART OF THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS, WE CONSIDERED PROJECTED  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HEADCOUNT GROWTH IN THIS REGION, AS WELL AS ONGOING COMPLIANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HOLDING THE LAND, AND CONCLUDED THAT OUR CASH, INCLUDING CASH FROM THE SALE OF THIS ASSET, WOULD GENERATE A HIGHER RETURN ELSEWHERE. THE RECLASSIFICATION TO HELD FOR SALE TRIGGERED A REDUCTION IN VALUE TO $9.0 MILLION, WHICH REPRESENTS THE LOWER OF NET BOOK VALUE AND MARKET VALUE.  WE ARE ACTIVELY MARKETING THIS LAND FOR SALE AND EXPECT TO COMPLETE A TRANSACTION OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  \u200b  CASH FLOWS  \u200b  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  SIX MONTHS ENDED  \u200b  \u200b  SEPTEMBER 30,  \u200b  2019  2018  \u200b  \u200b  (IN THOUSANDS)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  \u200b  $23,804  \u200b  $33,283  \u200b  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  \u200b  (14,618)  \u200b  (26,690)  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  \u200b  (11,600)  \u200b  (11,729)  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH  \u200b  (4,012)  \u200b  (11,694)  NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH  \u200b  (6,426)  \u200b  (16,830)  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH, BEGINNING OF YEAR  \u200b  190,113  \u200b  195,236  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH, END OF PERIOD  \u200b  $183,687  \u200b  $178,406  \u200b  \u200b  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  \u200b  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE WORKING CAPITAL AND AN INCREASE IN THE LONG-TERM ASSETS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASE IN THE NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH EXPENSES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  \u200b  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  \u200b  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN OR IMPLIED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SERVICE OUR DEBT AND TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS BORROWINGS UNDER OUR  ABL FACILITY  , REDUCTIONS IN REVENUE FORECASTS, OUR ABILITY TO RENEW OUR BROADCAST LICENSES, CHANGES IN INTEREST  RATES INCLUDING THE TRANSITION FROM LIBOR AS AN INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK TO OTHER POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE REFERENCE RATES, THE  TIMING OF, OUR ABILITY TO COMPLETE ANY ACQUISITIONS OR DISPOSITIONS, COSTS AND SYNERGIES RESULTING FROM THE INTEGRATION OF ANY COMPLETED ACQUISITIONS, OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE COSTS, OUR ABILITY TO DRIVE AND MANAGE GROWTH, THE POPULARITY OF RADIO AS A BROADCASTING AND ADVERTISING MEDIUM, CHANGES IN CONSUMER TASTES, THE IMPACT OF GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN SPECIFIC MARKETS IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, INDUSTRY CONDITIONS, INCLUDING EXISTING COMPETITION AND FUTURE COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND CANCELLATION, DISRUPTIONS OR POSTPONEMENTS OF ADVERTISING SCHEDULES IN RESPONSE TO NATIONAL OR WORLD EVENTS, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES FROM NEW SOURCES, INCLUDING LOCAL COMMERCE AND TECHNOLOGY-BASED INITIATIVES, THE IMPACT OF REGULATORY RULES OR PROCEEDINGS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THE FUTURE WRITE OFF OF ANY MATERIAL PORTION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FCC BROADCAST LICENSES AND GOODWILL.  CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE PRIOR YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.  OVERVIEW  WE HAVE THREE OPERATING SEGMENTS  : (1) BROADCAST, (2) DIGITAL MEDIA, AND (3) PUBLISHING, WHICH ALSO QUALIFY AS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. OUR  OPERATING SEGMENTS REFLECT HOW  OUR  CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKERS, WHICH WE DEFINE AS A COLLECTIVE GROUP OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES, ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT AND DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ALLOCATIONS OF RESOURCES TO EACH SEGMENT. WE CONTINUALLY REVIEW OUR OPERATING SEGMENT CLASSIFICATIONS TO ALIGN WITH OPERATIONAL CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND MAY MAKE CHANGES AS NECESSARY.  WE MEASURE AND EVALUATE OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING EXPENSES THAT EXCLUDE COSTS RELATED TO CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE, HUMAN RESOURCES, LEGAL, TAX AND TREASURY. WE ALSO EXCLUDE COSTS SUCH AS AMORTIZATION, DEPRECIATION, TAXES AND INTEREST EXPENSE WHEN EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS.  OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF BROADCAST REVENUE INCLUDE.  \u2022  THE SALE OF BLOCK PROGRAM TIME TO NATIONAL AND LOCAL PROGRAM PRODUCERS;  \u2022  THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME ON OUR RADIO STATIONS TO NATIONAL AND LOCAL ADVERTISERS;  \u2022  THE SALE OF BANNER ADVERTISEMENTS ON OUR STATION WEBSITES OR ON OUR MOBILE APPLICATIONS;  \u2022  THE SALE OF DIGITAL STREAMING ADVERTISEMENTS ON OUR STATION WEBSITES OR ON OUR MOBILE APPLICATIONS;  \u2022  THE SALE OF ADVERTISEMENTS INCLUDED IN DIGITAL NEWSLETTERS;  \u2022  FEES EARNED FOR THE CREATION OF CUSTOM WEB PAGES AND CUSTOM DIGITAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS FOR OUR ADVERTISERS THROUGH SALEM SURROUND;  \u2022  THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME ON OUR NATIONAL NETWORK;  \u2022  THE SYNDICATION OF PROGRAMMING ON OUR NATIONAL NETWORK;  \u2022  PRODUCT SALES AND ROYALTIES FOR ON-AIR HOST MATERIALS, INCLUDING PODCASTS AND PROGRAMS; AND  \u2022  OTHER REVENUE SUCH AS EVENTS, INCLUDING TICKET SALES AND SPONSORSHIPS, LISTENER PURCHASE PROGRAMS, WHERE REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM SPECIAL DISCOUNTS AND INCENTIVES OFFERED TO OUR LISTENERS FROM OUR ADVERTISERS; TALENT FEES FOR VOICE-OVERS OR CUSTOM ENDORSEMENTS FROM OUR ON-AIR PERSONALITIES AND PRODUCTION SERVICES, AND RENTAL INCOME FOR STUDIOS, TOWERS OR OFFICE SPACE.  41  OUR  PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF DIGITAL MEDIA REVENUE INCLUDE.  \u2022  THE SALE OF DIGITAL BANNER ADVERTISEMENTS ON OUR WEBSITES AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS;  \u2022  THE SALE OF DIGITAL STREAMING ADVERTISEMENTS ON WEBSITES AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS;  \u2022  THE SUPPORT AND PROMOTION TO STREAM THIRD-PARTY CONTENT ON OUR WEBSITES;  \u2022  THE SALE OF ADVERTISEMENTS INCLUDED IN DIGITAL NEWSLETTERS;  \u2022  THE DIGITAL DELIVERY OF NEWSLETTERS TO SUBSCRIBERS; AND  \u2022  THE NUMBER OF VIDEO AND GRAPHIC DOWNLOADS.  OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF PUBLISHING REVENUE INCLUDE.  \u2022  THE SALE OF BOOKS AND E-BOOKS;  \u2022  PUBLISHING FEES FROM AUTHORS;  \u2022  THE SALE OF DIGITAL ADVERTISING ON OUR MAGAZINE WEBSITES AND DIGITAL NEWSLETTERS;  \u2022  SUBSCRIPTION FEES FOR OUR PRINT MAGAZINE; AND  \u2022  THE SALE OF PRINT MAGAZINE ADVERTISING.  IN EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, THE RATES WE ARE ABLE TO CHARGE FOR AIR-TIME, ADVERTISING AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  AUDIENCE SHARE;  \u2022  HOW WELL OUR PROGRAMS AND ADVERTISEMENTS PERFORM FOR OUR CLIENTS;  \u2022  THE SIZE OF THE MARKET AND AUDIENCE REACHED;  \u2022  THE NUMBER OF IMPRESSIONS DELIVERED;  \u2022  THE NUMBER OF ADVERTISEMENTS AND PROGRAMS STREAMED;  \u2022  THE NUMBER OF PAGE VIEWS ACHIEVED;  \u2022  THE NUMBER OF DOWNLOADS COMPLETED;  \u2022  THE NUMBER OF EVENTS HELD, THE NUMBER OF EVENT SPONSORSHIPS SOLD AND THE ATTENDANCE AT EACH EVENT;  \u2022  DEMAND FOR BOOKS AND PUBLICATIONS;  \u2022  GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; AND  \u2022  SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR AIR-TIME ON A LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVEL.  BROADCASTING  OUR FOUNDATIONAL BUSINESS IS RADIO BROADCASTING, WHICH INCLUDES THE OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF RADIO STATIONS IN LARGE METROPOLITAN MARKETS,  OUR NATIONAL NETWORKS AND OUR NATIONAL SALES FIRMS INCLUDING SALEM SURROUND. REVENUES GENERATED FROM OUR RADIO STATIONS, NETWORKS AND SALES FIRMS ARE REPORTED AS BROADCAST MEDIA REVENUE IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECORDED ON A GROSS BASIS UNLESS AN AGENCY REPRESENTS THE ADVERTISER, IN WHICH CASE, REVENUE IS REPORTED NET OF THE COMMISSION RETAINED BY THE AGENCY.  BROADCAST REVENUES ARE IMPACTED BY THE RATES RADIO STATIONS CAN CHARGE FOR PROGRAMMING AND ADVERTISING TIME, THE LEVEL OF AIRTIME SOLD TO PROGRAMMERS AND ADVERTISERS, THE NUMBER OF IMPRESSIONS DELIVERED OR DOWNLOADS MADE, AND THE NUMBER OF EVENTS HELD, INCLUDING THE SIZE OF THE EVENT AND THE NUMBER OF ATTENDEES. BLOCK PROGRAMMING RATES ARE BASED UPON OUR STATIONS\u2019 ABILITY TO ATTRACT AUDIENCES THAT WILL SUPPORT THE PROGRAM PRODUCERS THROUGH CONTRIBUTIONS AND PURCHASES OF THEIR PRODUCTS. ADVERTISING RATES ARE BASED UPON THE DEMAND FOR ADVERTISING TIME, WHICH IN TURN IS BASED ON OUR STATIONS AND NETWORKS\u2019 ABILITY TO PRODUCE RESULTS FOR THEIR ADVERTISERS. WE MARKET OURSELVES TO ADVERTISERS BASED ON THE RESPONSIVENESS OF OUR AUDIENCES. WE DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO TRADITIONAL AUDIENCE MEASURING SERVICES FOR MOST OF OUR RADIO STATIONS. IN SELECT MARKETS, WE SUBSCRIBE TO NIELSEN AUDIO, WHICH DEVELOPS MONTHLY REPORTS MEASURING A RADIO STATION\u2019S AUDIENCE SHARE IN THE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS TARGETED BY ADVERTISERS. EACH OF OUR RADIO STATIONS AND OUR NETWORKS HAS A PRE-DETERMINED LEVEL OF TIME AVAILABLE FOR BLOCK PROGRAMMING AND/OR ADVERTISING, WHICH MAY VARY AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE DAY.  NIELSEN AUDIO USES THE PORTABLE PEOPLE METER  TM  (\u201cPPM  \u201d  ) TECHNOLOGY TO COLLECT DATA FOR ITS RATINGS SERVICE. PPM IS A SMALL DEVICE THAT IS CAPABLE OF AUTOMATICALLY MEASURING RADIO, TELEVISION, INTERNET, SATELLITE RADIO AND SATELLITE TELEVISION SIGNALS ENCODED BY THE BROADCASTER. THE PPM OFFERS A NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES OVER TRADITIONAL DIARY RATINGS COLLECTION SYSTEMS, INCLUDING EASE OF USE, MORE RELIABLE RATINGS DATA, SHORTER TIME PERIODS BETWEEN WHEN ADVERTISING RUNS AND ACTUAL LISTENING DATA, AND LITTLE MANIPULATION OF DATA BY USERS. A DISADVANTAGE OF THE PPM INCLUDES DATA FLUCTUATIONS FROM CHANGES TO THE \u201cPANEL\u201d (A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS HOLDING PPM DEVICES). THIS MAKES ALL STATIONS SUSCEPTIBLE TO SOME INCONSISTENCIES IN RATINGS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF LISTENERS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. WE SUBSCRIBE TO NIELSEN AUDIO FOR RATINGS SERVICES IN ONLY 22 OF OUR MARKETS.  42  AS IS TYPICAL IN THE RADIO BROADCASTING INDUSTRY, OUR SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTER ADVERTISING REVENUE GENERALLY EXCEEDS OUR FIRST AND THIR  D QUARTER ADVERTISIN  G REVENUE.  THIS SEASONAL FLUCTUATION IN ADVERTISING REVENUE CORRESPONDS WITH QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS IN TH  E RETAIL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY.  ADDITIONALLY, WE EXPERIENCE INCREASED DEMAND FOR ADVERTISING DURING ELECTION YEARS BY WAY OF POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENTS.  D  URING ELECTION YEARS, OR EVEN NUMBERED YEARS, WE BENEFIT FROM A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE OVER NON-E  LECTION OR ODD NUMBERED YEARS.  POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE VARIES BASED ON THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF CANDIDATES AS WELL AS THE NU  MBER AND TYPE OF  DEBATED ISSUES.  QUARTERLY BLOCK PROGRAMMING REVENUE TENDS NOT TO VARY  SIGNIFICANTLY  BECAUSE PROGRAM RATES  ARE GENERALLY SET ANNUALLY AND  RECOGNIZED ON A PER PROGRAM BASIS.  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM BROADCASTING ARE AFFECTED BY TRANSITIONAL PERIODS EXPERIENCED BY RADIO STATIONS WHEN, BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE RADIO STATION, OUR PLANS FOR THE MARKET AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES, WE FIND IT BENEFICIAL TO CHANGE THE STATION FORMAT. DURING THIS TRANSITIONAL PERIOD, WHEN WE DEVELOP A RADIO STATION\u2019S LISTENER AND CUSTOMER BASE, THE STATION MAY GENERATE NEGATIVE OR INSIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW.  IN BROADCASTING, TRADE OR BARTER AGREEMENTS ARE COMMONLY USED TO  REDUCE CASH EXPENSES BY EXCHANGING ADVERTISING TIME FOR GOODS OR SERVICES  . WE MAY ENTER BARTER AGREEMENTS TO EXCHANGE AIR TIME OR DIGITAL ADVERTISING FOR GOODS OR SERVICES THAT CAN BE USED IN OUR BUSINESS OR THAT CAN BE SOLD TO OUR AUDIENCE UNDER LISTENER PURCHASE PROGRAMS. THE TERMS OF THESE BARTER AGREEMENTS PERMIT US TO PREEMPT THE BARTER AIR TIME OR DIGITAL CAMPAIGN IN FAVOR OF CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASE THE AIR TIME OR DIGITAL CAMPAIGN FOR CASH. THE VALUE OF THESE NON-CASH EXCHANGES IS INCLUDED IN REVENUE IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES WE RECEIVE. EACH TRANSACTION IS REVIEWED TO DETERMINE THAT THE PRODUCTS, SUPPLIES AND/OR SERVICES WE RECEIVE HAVE ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE, OR VALUE TO US. WE RECORD BARTER OPERATING EXPENSES UPON RECEIPT AND USAGE OF THE PRODUCTS, SUPPLIES AND SERVICES, AS APPLICABLE. WE RECORD BARTER REVENUE AS ADVERTISING SPOTS OR DIGITAL CAMPAIGNS ARE DELIVERED, WHICH REPRESENTS THE POINT IN TIME THAT CONTROL IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER THEREBY COMPLETING OUR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. BARTER REVENUE IS RECORDED ON A GROSS BASIS UNLESS AN AGENCY REPRESENTS THE PROGRAMMER, IN WHICH CASE, REVENUE IS REPORTED NET OF THE COMMISSION RETAINED BY THE AGENCY. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, 97% OF OUR BROADCAST REVENUE WAS SOLD FOR CASH.  BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE: (I) EMPLOYEE SALARIES, COMMISSIONS AND RELATED EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND TAXES, (II) FACILITY EXPENSES SUCH AS LEASE COST AND UTILITIES, (III) MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES, (IV) PRODUCTION AND PROGRAMMING EXPENSES, AND (V) MUSIC LICENSE FEES. IN ADDITION TO THESE EXPENSES, OUR NETWORK INCURS PROGRAMMING COSTS AND LEASE EXPENSES FOR SATELLITE COMMUNICATION FACILITIES.  DIGITAL MEDIA  WEB-BASED AND DIGITAL CONTENT CONTINUES TO BE A FOCUS OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. OUR DIGITAL MEDIA BASED BUSINESSES PROVIDE CHRISTIAN, CONSERVATIVE, INVESTING AND HEALTH-THEMED CONTENT, E-COMMERCE, AUDIO AND VIDEO STREAMING, AND OTHER RESOURCES DIGITALLY THROUGH THE WEB. REVENUES GENERATED THIS SEGMENT ARE REPORTED AS DIGITAL MEDIA REVENUE IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  DIGITAL MEDIA REVENUES ARE IMPACTED BY THE RATES OUR SITES CAN CHARGE FOR ADVERTISING TIME, THE LEVEL OF ADVERTISEMENTS SOLD, THE NUMBER OF IMPRESSIONS DELIVERED OR THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS SOLD AND THE NUMBER OF DIGITAL SUBSCRIPTIONS SOLD. LIKE OUR BROADCASTING SEGMENT, OUR SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTER ADVERTISING REVENUE GENERALLY EXCEEDS OUR FIRST AND THIRD QUARTER ADVERTISING REVENUE. THIS SEASONAL FLUCTUATION IN ADVERTISING REVENUE CORRESPONDS WITH QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE RETAIL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY. WE ALSO EXPERIENCE FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER COMPARISONS BASED ON THE DATE ON WHICH THE EASTER HOLIDAY IS OBSERVED, AS THIS HOLIDAY GENERATES A HIGHER VOLUME OF PRODUCT DOWNLOADS FROM OUR CHURCH PRODUCT SITES. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXPERIENCE INCREASED DEMAND FOR ADVERTISING TIME AND PLACEMENT DURING ELECTION YEARS FOR POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENTS.  DIGITAL MEDIA OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE: (I) EMPLOYEE SALARIES, COMMISSIONS AND RELATED EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND TAXES, (II) FACILITY EXPENSES SUCH AS LEASE COSTS AND UTILITIES, (III) MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES, (IV) ROYALTIES, (V) STREAMING COSTS, AND (VI) COST OF GOODS SOLD ASSOCIATED WITH E-COMMERCE SITES.  PUBLISHING  OUR PUBLISHING OPERATIONS INCLUDE BOOK PUBLISHING THROUGH REGNERY  \u00ae  PUBLISHING, A PRINT MAGAZINE AND OUR SELF-PUBLISHING SERVICES. REVENUES GENERATED FROM THIS SEGMENT ARE REPORTED AS PUBLISHING REVENUE IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  PUBLISHING REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY THE NUMBER AND THE RETAIL PRICE OF BOOKS AND E-BOOKS SOLD, THE NUMBER AND RATE OF PRINT MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS SOLD, THE RATE AND NUMBER OF PAGES OF ADVERTISEMENTS SOLD IN EACH PRINT MAGAZINE, AND THE NUMBER AND RATE AT WHICH SELF-PUBLISHED BOOKS ARE PUBLISHED. REGNERY  \u00ae  PUBLISHING REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY ELECTIONS AS IT GENERATES HIGHER LEVELS OF INTEREST AND DEMAND FOR PUBLICATIONS CONTAINING CONSERVATIVE AND POLITICAL BASED OPINIONS.  PUBLISHING OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE: (I) EMPLOYEE SALARIES, COMMISSIONS AND RELATED EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND TAXES, (II) FACILITY EXPENSES SUCH AS LEASE COSTS AND UTILITIES, (III) MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES; AND (IV) COST OF GOODS SOLD THAT INCLUDES PRINTING AND PRODUCTION COSTS, FULFILLMENT COSTS, AUTHOR ROYALTIES AND INVENTORY RESERVES.  43  KNOWN TRENDS AND  UNCERTAINTIES  WE BELIEVE THAT BROADCAST REVENUE GROWTH REMAINS CHALLENGED  DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING INCREASING COMPETITION FROM OTHER FORMS OF CONTENT DISTRIBUTION AND TIME SPENT LISTENING BY AUDIO STREAMING SERVICES,  PODCASTS AND SATELLITE RADIO.  THIS INCREASE IN COMPETITION AND MIX OF RADIO LISTENING TIME MAY LEAD ADVERTISERS TO CONCLUDE THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RADIO HAS DIMINISHED. TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS, WE CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR DIGITAL ASSETS TO COMPLEMENT OUR BROADCAST CONTENT. THE INCREASE USE OF VOICE ACTIVATED PLATFORMS, OR SMART SPEAKERS, THAT PROVIDE AUDIENCES WITH THE ABILITY TO ACCESS AM AND FM RADIO STATIONS SHOW INCREASED POTENTIAL FOR BROADCASTERS TO REACH AUDIENCES.  OUR BROADCAST REVENUES ARE PARTICULARLY DEPENDENT ON ADVERTISING FROM OUR LOS ANGELES AND DALLAS MARKETS, WHICH GENERATED 15.1% AND 20.5%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR NET BROADCAST ADVERTISING REVENUE DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  REVENUES FROM PRINT MAGAZINES, INCLUDING ADVERTISING REVENUE AND SUBSCRIPTION REVENUES, ARE CHALLENGED DUE TO LOWER DEMAND FROM THE AUDIENCES THAT INCREASINGLY USE OTHER MEDIUMS THAT DELIVER COMPARABLE INFORMATION. BOOK SALES ARE CONTINGENT UPON OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN AUTHORS. B  ECAUSE DIGITAL MEDIA HAS BEEN A GROWTH AREA FOR US, DECREASES IN DIGITAL REVENUE STREAMS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. DIGITAL REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY THE NATURE AND DELIVERY OF PAGE VIEWS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A SHIFT IN THE NUMBER OF PAGE VIEWS FROM DESKTOP DEVICES TO MOBILE DEVICES. WHILE MOBILE PAGE VIEWS HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY, THEY CARRY A LOWER NUMBER OF ADVERTISEMENTS PER PAGE WHICH ARE GENERALLY SOLD AT LOWER RATES. DIGITAL MEDIA REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY PAGE VIEWS AND THE NUMBER OF ADVERTISEMENTS PER PAGE. DECLINES IN DESKTOP PAGE VIEWS NEGATIVELY IMPACT REVENUE AS MOBILE DEVICES CARRY LOWER RATES AND LESS ADVERTISEMENT PER PAGE. TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT THAT ANY ONE OF THESE AREAS COULD HAVE, WE CONTINUE  TO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES TO CROSS-PROMOTE OUR BRANDS AND OUR CONTENT, AND TO STRATEGICALLY MONITOR COSTS.  WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRICES, SEEK TO RENEW OR RENEGOTIATE LEASE TERMS UNDER A \u201cBLEND AND EXTEND\u201d OPTION THAT WE BELIEVE PROVIDES US WITH FAVORABLE LEASE TERMS OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD FROM FIVE TO TWENTY YEARS. AS LEASE EXPENSE IS RECORDED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM, WE EXPECT OUR LEASE EXPENSE TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $0.6 MILLION PER ANNUM AS COMPARED TO PRIOR PERIODS. ACTUAL CASH PAYMENTS FOR LEASED PROPERTIES ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN CONSISTENT WITH ANNUAL INCREASES OF GENERALLY UP TO 3% OR A PERCENTAGE OF THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX.  KEY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS \u2013 SAME-STATION DEFINITION  IN THE DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BELOW, WE COMPARE OUR BROADCAST OPERATING RESULTS BETWEEN PERIODS ON AN AS-REPORTED BASIS, WHICH INCLUDES THE OPERATING RESULTS OF ALL RADIO STATIONS AND NETWORKS OWNED OR OPERATED AT ANY TIME DURING EITHER PERIOD AND ON A SAME STATION BASIS. SAME STATION IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE USED BOTH IN PRESENTING OUR RESULTS TO STOCKHOLDERS AND THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY AS WELL AS IN OUR INTERNAL EVALUATIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME PROVIDES A MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF PERIOD OVER PERIOD PERFORMANCE OF OUR CORE BROADCAST OPERATIONS AS THIS MEASURE EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF NEW STATIONS, THE IMPACT OF STATIONS WE NO LONGER OWN OR OPERATE, AND THE IMPACT OF STATIONS OPERATING UNDER A NEW PROGRAMMING FORMAT. OUR PRESENTATION OF SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME IS NOT INTENDED TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURES REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. OUR DEFINITION OF SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME IS NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. REFER TO \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d BELOW FOR A RECONCILIATION OF THESE NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURES.  WE DEFINE SAME STATION NET BROADCAST REVENUE AS NET BROADCAST REVENUE FROM OUR RADIO STATIONS AND NETWORKS THAT WE OWN OR OPERATE IN THE SAME FORMAT ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF EACH QUARTER, AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. WE DEFINE SAME STATION BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES AS BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES FROM OUR RADIO STATIONS AND NETWORKS THAT WE OWN OR OPERATE IN THE SAME FORMAT ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF EACH QUARTER, AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES THOSE STATIONS WE OWN OR OPERATE IN THE SAME FORMAT ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF EACH QUARTER, AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME FOR A FULL CALENDAR YEAR IS CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF THE SAME STATION RESULTS FOR EACH OF THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THAT YEAR.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  MANAGEMENT USES  CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES DEFINED BELOW IN COMMUNICATIONS WITH INVESTORS, ANALYSTS, RATING AGENCIES, BANKS AND OTHERS TO ASSIST SUCH PARTIES IN UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF VARIOUS ITEMS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE USE THESE  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO EVALUATE FINANCIAL RESULTS, DEVELOP BUDGETS, MANAGE EXPENDITURES AND AS A MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE UNDER COMPENSATION PROGRAMS.  OUR PRESENTATION OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURES AS REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  ITEM 101 OF REGULATION S-K DEFINES AND PRESCRIBES THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION MAY BE PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT. WE CLOSELY MONITOR EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA, STATION OPERATING INCOME (\u201cSOI\u201d), SAME STATION NET BROADCAST REVENUE, SAME STATION BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES, SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME, DIGITAL MEDIA OPERATING INCOME, AND PUBLISHING OPERATING INCOME, ALL OF WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CORE OPERATING RESULTS, AND THUS, ARE APPROPRIATE TO ENHANCE THE OVERALL UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR UNDERLYING OPERATIONAL RESULTS, TRENDS AND PERFORMANCE.  44  THE PERFORMANCE OF A RADIO BROADCASTING COMPANY IS CUSTOMARILY MEASURED BY THE ABILITY OF ITS STATIONS TO GENERATE  SOI.  WE DEFINE SOI AS NET BROADCAST REVENUE LESS  BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES.  ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN NET BROADCAST REVENUE AND  BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES, AS EXPLAINED ABOVE, HAVE A DI  RECT IMPACT ON CHANGES IN SOI.  SOI IS NOT A MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE CALCU  LATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  SOI  SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO AND NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PRE  SENTED ON THE BASIS OF GAAP.  WE BELIEVE THAT SOI IS A USEFUL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE TO INVESTORS WHEN CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OPERATING INCOME (  THE  MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE  S TO SOI  ), BECAUSE IT IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED BY T  HE RADIO BROADCASTING INDUSTRY AS A TOOL IN MEASURING PERFORMANCE AND IN APPLYING VALUATION METHODOLOGIES FOR COMPANIES IN THE MEDIA, ENTERTAINMENT  AND COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES.  SOI IS  COMMONLY  USED BY INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS WHO REPORT ON THE INDUSTRY TO  PROVIDE COMPARISON  S BETWEEN BROADCASTING GROUPS.  WE USE SOI AS ONE OF THE KEY MEASURES OF OPERATING EFFICIENCY  AND  PROFITABILITY  , INCLUDING  OUR INTERNAL REVIEW  S  ASSOCIATED WITH IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS OF  OUR  INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  SOI DOES NOT PUR  PORT TO REPRESENT CASH PRO  VIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  OUR STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS PRESENTS OUR CASH ACTIVITY  IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP  AND OUR INCOME STATEMENT PRESENTS OUR  FINANCIAL  PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  OUR DEFINITION OF SOI IS N  OT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  WE DEFINE SAME STATION NET BROADCAST REVENUE AS NET BROADCAST REVENUE FROM OUR RADIO STATIONS AND NETWORKS THAT WE OWN OR OPERATE IN THE SAME FORMAT ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF EACH QUARTER, AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. WE DEFINE SAME STATION BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES AS BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES FROM OUR RADIO STATIONS AND NETWORKS THAT WE OWN OR OPERATE IN THE SAME FORMAT ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF EACH QUARTER, AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES THOSE STATIONS WE OWN OR OPERATE IN THE SAME FORMAT ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF EACH QUARTER, AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME FOR A FULL CALENDAR YEAR IS CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF THE SAME STATION-RESULTS FOR EACH OF THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THAT YEAR. WE USE SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, BOTH IN PRESENTING OUR RESULTS TO STOCKHOLDERS AND THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY, AND IN OUR INTERNAL EVALUATIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME PROVIDES A MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF PERIOD OVER PERIOD PERFORMANCE OF OUR CORE BROADCAST OPERATIONS AS THIS MEASURE EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF NEW STATIONS, THE IMPACT OF STATIONS WE NO LONGER OWN OR OPERATE, AND THE IMPACT OF STATIONS OPERATING UNDER A NEW PROGRAMMING FORMAT. OUR PRESENTATION OF SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME IS NOT INTENDED TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURES REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. OUR DEFINITION OF SAME STATION NET BROADCAST REVENUE, SAME STATION BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES AND SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME IS NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  WE APPLY A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA AND PUBLISHING GROUP. DIGITAL MEDIA OPERATING INCOME IS DEFINED AS NET DIGITAL MEDIA REVENUE LESS DIGITAL MEDIA OPERATING EXPENSES. PUBLISHING OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) IS DEFINED AS NET PUBLISHING REVENUE LESS PUBLISHING OPERATING EXPENSES. DIGITAL MEDIA OPERATING INCOME AND PUBLISHING OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) ARE NOT MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. OUR PRESENTATIONS OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE NOT TO BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE BELIEVE THAT DIGITAL MEDIA OPERATING INCOME AND PUBLISHING OPERATING INCOME ARE USEFUL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO INVESTORS, WHEN CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OPERATING INCOME (THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE), BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BROADCASTING ENTITIES. WE USE THIS ANALYSIS AS ONE OF THE KEY MEASURES OF OPERATING EFFICIENCY, PROFITABILITY AND IN OUR INTERNAL REVIEW. THIS MEASUREMENT DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. OUR STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS PRESENTS OUR CASH ACTIVITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND OUR INCOME STATEMENT PRESENTS OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. OUR DEFINITIONS OF DIGITAL MEDIA OPERATING INCOME AND PUBLISHING OPERATING INCOME ARE NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN FOR REGNERY PUBLISHING WAS 57% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO 58% FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. REGNERY PUBLISHING MARGINS ARE IMPACTED BY THE VOLUME OF E-BOOK SALES, WHICH HAVE HIGHER MARGINS DUE TO THE NATURE OF DELIVERY AND LACK OF SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES.

THE DECREASE OF $0.6 MILLION REFLECTS THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE NOTES, THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE ABL AND FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. FUTURE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WILL NOT IMPACT OUR FIXED RATE NOTES, BUT AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES MAY IMPACT THE VARIABLE RATE AT WHICH WE CAN BORROW UNDER OUR ABL FACILITY AND RESULT IN HIGHER INTEREST CHARGES. THE LIBOR RATE SCHEDULED TO BE DISCONTINUED AT THE END OF CALENDAR YEAR 2021 WOULD RESULT IN ALL OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS SUBJECT TO THE HIGHER BASE RATE BORROWING. WE EXPECT TO AMEND THE ABL PRIOR TO THE LIBOR PHASEOUT BASED ON THE ABL MATURITY DATE OF MAY 19, 2022.  THE GAIN ON THE EARLY RETIREMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT REFLECTS $6.7 MILLION OF REPURCHASES OF THE NOTES AT PRICES BELOW FACE VALUE RESULTING IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $0.4 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $0.2 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR EACH PERIOD DIFFERS FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY INCOME RATE OF 21.0% DUE TO THE EFFECT OF THE SALE OF BUSINESS ASSETS IN VARIOUS STATES, STATE INCOME TAXES, CERTAIN EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES, AND CHANGES IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  SIGNIFICANT AREAS FOR WHICH MANAGEMENT USES ESTIMATES INCLUDE.  \u2022  REVENUE RECOGNITION,  \u2022  ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, INCLUDING BROADCASTING LICENSES, GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS;  \u2022  PROBABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION;  \u2022  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS;  \u2022  CONTINGENCY RESERVES;  \u2022  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS;  60  \u2022  SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES;  \u2022  BARTER TRANSACTIONS;  \u2022  INVENTORY RESERVES;  \u2022  RESERVES FOR ROYALTY ADVANCES;  \u2022  FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY AWARDS;  \u2022  SELF-INSURANCE RESERVES;  \u2022  ESTIMATED LIVES FOR TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS;  \u2022  ASSESSMENT OF CONTRACT-BASED FACTORS, ASSET-BASED FACTORS, ENTITY-BASED FACTORS AND MARKET-BASED FACTORS TO DETERMINE THE LEASE TERM IMPACTING RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES,  \u2022  DETERMINING THE INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE (\u201cIBR\u201d) FOR CALCULATING ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES  \u2022  INCOME TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES; AND  \u2022  UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS  THESE ESTIMATES REQUIRE THE USE OF JUDGMENT AS FUTURE EVENTS AND THE EFFECT OF THESE EVENTS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. THE ESTIMATES WILL CHANGE AS NEW EVENTS OCCUR, AS MORE EXPERIENCE IS ACQUIRED AND AS MORE INFORMATION IS OBTAINED. WE EVALUATE AND UPDATE OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND WE MAY CONSULT OUTSIDE EXPERTS TO ASSIST AS CONSIDERED NECESSARY.  WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE RELATED JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ARE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT AFFECT THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES MUST BE MADE IN CONNECTION WITH DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE TO BE RECOGNIZED IN ANY ACCOUNTING PERIOD. WE MUST ASSESS THE PROMISES WITHIN EACH SALES CONTRACT TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. ONCE THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION(S) ARE DETERMINED, THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION(S) BASED ON A RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE BASIS. IF A SALES CONTRACT CONTAINS A SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, THE ENTIRE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO THE SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. CONTRACTS THAT CONTAIN MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS REQUIRE AN ALLOCATION OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BASED ON A RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE. IF THE STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICE IS NOT DETERMINABLE, AN ESTIMATE IS USED.  WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES RELATED TO VARIABLE CONSIDERATION AT THE POINT OF SALE, INCLUDING ESTIMATES FOR REFUNDS AND PRODUCT RETURNS. UNDER ASC TOPIC 606, ESTIMATES OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION ARE TO BE RECOGNIZED BEFORE CONTINGENCIES ARE RESOLVED IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL IN THE AMOUNT OF ANY ESTIMATED CUMULATIVE REVENUE WILL NOT OCCUR.  A GROWING SOURCE OF REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM DIGITAL PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WHICH ALLOW FOR ENHANCED AUDIENCE INTERACTION AND PARTICIPATION, AND INTEGRATED DIGITAL ADVERTISING SOLUTIONS. WHEN OFFERING DIGITAL PRODUCTS, ANOTHER PARTY MAY BE INVOLVED IN PROVIDING THE GOODS OR SERVICES THAT MAKE UP A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION TO THE CUSTOMER. THESE INCLUDE THE USE OF THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES FOR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS. WE MUST EVALUATE IF WE ARE THE PRINCIPAL OR AGENT IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF REVENUE SHOULD BE REPORTED GROSS AS PRINCIPAL OR NET AS AGENT. IN THIS EVALUATION, WE CONSIDER IF WE OBTAIN CONTROL OF THE SPECIFIED GOODS OR SERVICES BEFORE THEY ARE TRANSFERRED TO OUR CUSTOMER, AS WELL AS OTHER INDICATORS SUCH AS THE PARTY PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR FULFILLMENT, INVENTORY RISK, AND DISCRETION IN ESTABLISHING PRICE. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER WE CONTROL A SPECIFIED GOOD OR SERVICE IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE GOOD OR SERVICE BEING TRANSFERRED REQUIRES US TO MAKE REASONABLE JUDGMENTS ON THE NATURE OF EACH AGREEMENT. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT WE ARE ACTING AS PRINCIPAL WHEN WE MANAGE ALL ASPECTS OF A SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN, INCLUDING REVIEWING AND APPROVING TARGET AUDIENCES, MONITORING ACTUAL RESULTS AND MAKING MODIFICATIONS AS NEEDED AND WHEN WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING CAMPAIGN RESULTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS REGARDLESS OF THE USE OF A THIRD-PARTY OR PARTIES.  TRADE AND BARTER TRANSACTIONS  IN BROADCASTING, TRADE OR BARTER AGREEMENTS ARE COMMONLY USED TO  REDUCE CASH EXPENSES BY EXCHANGING ADVERTISING TIME FOR GOODS OR SERVICES  . WE MAY ENTER BARTER AGREEMENTS TO EXCHANGE AIR TIME OR DIGITAL ADVERTISING FOR GOODS OR SERVICES THAT CAN BE USED IN OUR BUSINESS OR THAT CAN BE SOLD TO OUR AUDIENCE UNDER LISTENER PURCHASE PROGRAMS. THE TERMS OF THESE BARTER AGREEMENTS PERMIT US TO PREEMPT THE BARTER AIR TIME OR DIGITAL CAMPAIGN IN FAVOR OF CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASE THE AIR TIME OR DIGITAL CAMPAIGN FOR CASH. THE VALUE OF THESE NON-CASH EXCHANGES IS INCLUDED IN REVENUE IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES WE RECEIVE. EACH TRANSACTION MUST BE REVIEWED TO DETERMINE THAT THE PRODUCTS, SUPPLIES AND/OR SERVICES WE RECEIVE HAVE ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE, OR VALUE TO US. WE RECORD BARTER OPERATING EXPENSES UPON RECEIPT AND USAGE OF THE PRODUCTS, SUPPLIES AND SERVICES, AS APPLICABLE. WE RECORD BARTER REVENUE AS ADVERTISING SPOTS OR DIGITAL CAMPAIGNS ARE DELIVERED, WHICH REPRESENTS THE POINT IN TIME THAT CONTROL IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER THEREBY COMPLETING OUR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. BARTER REVENUE IS RECORDED ON A GROSS BASIS UNLESS AN AGENCY REPRESENTS THE PROGRAMMER, IN WHICH CASE, REVENUE IS REPORTED NET OF THE COMMISSION RETAINED BY THE AGENCY.  BROADCAST LICENSES, GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS  APPROXIMATELY 63% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 CONSISTED OF INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDING BROADCAST LICENSES, GOODWILL AND MASTHEADS. THESE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ORIGINATED FROM ACQUISITIONS IN WHICH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT  61  OF THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO BROADCAST  LICENSES AND  GOODWILL.  WE DO NOT AM  ORTIZE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE  ASSETS, BUT RATHER TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT AN ASSET MAY BE  IMPAIRED.  WE PERFORM OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, WHICH  COINCIDES WITH OUR BUDGET AND PLANNING PROCESS FOR  THE UPCOMING YEAR.  IMPAIRMENT TESTING REQUIRES AN ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AS THE VALUE IS SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO OUR TOTAL ASSETS AND THE ESTIMATES INCORPORATE VARIABLES AND ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCES AND JUDGMENT ABOUT OUR FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT REFLECT OUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE ESTIMATES THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT RISK. IF ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES USED IN OUR ESTIMATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL. THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE DEFINED IN FASB ASC TOPIC 820,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES  AS LEVEL 3 INPUTS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 15 OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.  THE FIRST STEP OF OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IS IMPAIRED. THIS QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT WHEN CONSIDERING THE EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY AFFECT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THESE EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NOT ALL-INCLUSIVE AND ARE NOT BY THEMSELVES INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT. WE CONSIDER EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FACTORS WHEN REVIEWING THE FOLLOWING EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH ARE PRESENTED IN THE ORDER OF WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE STRONGEST TO WEAKEST INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT.  (1)  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANY RECENT FAIR VALUE CALCULATIONS AND THE CARRYING VALUE;  (2)  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS STATION OPERATING INCOME, INCLUDING PERFORMANCE AS COMPARED TO PROJECTED RESULTS USED IN PRIOR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE;  (3)  MACROECONOMIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON ACCESSING CAPITAL THAT COULD AFFECT THE DISCOUNT RATES USED IN PRIOR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE;  (4)  INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS A DECLINE IN MARKET-DEPENDENT MULTIPLES OR METRICS, A CHANGE IN DEMAND, COMPETITION, OR OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS;  (5)  OPERATING COST FACTORS, SUCH AS INCREASES IN LABOR, THAT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON FUTURE EXPECTED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS;  (6)  LEGAL, REGULATORY, CONTRACTUAL, POLITICAL, BUSINESS, OR OTHER FACTORS;  (7)  OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY-SPECIFIC EVENTS SUCH AS CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT OR CUSTOMERS; AND  (8)  ANY CHANGES TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET.  IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM A SECOND STEP TO PREPARING A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR OR ENTERPRISE VALUE OF THE ASSETS. WE DID NOT FIND RECONCILIATION TO OUR CURRENT MARKET CAPITALIZATION MEANINGFUL IN THE DETERMINATION OF OUR ENTERPRISE VALUE GIVEN CURRENT FACTORS THAT IMPACT OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: LIMITED TRADING VOLUME, THE IMPACT OF OUR PUBLISHING SEGMENT OPERATING LOSSES AND THE SIGNIFICANT VOTING CONTROL OF OUR CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. WE ENGAGE AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY APPRAISAL AND VALUATION FIRM TO ASSIST US WITH DETERMINING THE ENTERPRISE VALUE AS PART OF OUR QUANTITATIVE REVIEW.  IF THE RESULTS OF OUR QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT IS RECORDED EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE MADE REASONABLE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO CALCULATE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, HOWEVER, THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL IN NATURE. ACTUAL RESULTS CAN BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. IF ACTUAL MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN THOSE PROJECTED BY THE INDUSTRY OR BY US, OR IF EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD REDUCE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BELOW THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, WE MAY RECOGNIZE FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL.  BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS  WE ACCOUNT FOR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AS SPECIFIED IN FASB ASC TOPIC 805  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  . THE TOTAL ACQUISITION CONSIDERATION IS ALLOCATED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BASED ON THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AS OF THE DATE OF THE TRANSACTION. ESTIMATES OF THE FAIR VALUE INCLUDE DISCOUNTED ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSETS AND THEIR EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MARKET TRENDS AND ANY SYNERGIES BELIEVED TO BE ACHIEVED FROM THE ACQUISITION. THE EXCESS OF CONSIDERATION PAID OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL AND ANY EXCESS OF FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED OVER THE CONSIDERATION PAID IS RECORDED AS A GAIN ON BARGAIN PURCHASE. PRIOR TO RECORDING A GAIN, THE ACQUIRING ENTITY MUST REASSESS WHETHER ALL ACQUIRED ASSETS AND ASSUMED LIABILITIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND RECOGNIZED AND PERFORM RE-MEASUREMENTS TO VERIFY THAT THE CONSIDERATION PAID, ASSETS ACQUIRED, AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED HAVE BEEN PROPERLY VALUED.  ACQUISITIONS MAY INCLUDE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION, THE FAIR VALUE OF WHICH IS ESTIMATED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED CONTINGENT PAYMENTS AS DETERMINED USING WEIGHTED PROBABILITIES OF THE PAYMENT AMOUNTS.  A MAJORITY OF OUR RADIO STATION ACQUISITIONS HAVE CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF THE FCC LICENSES TO BROADCAST IN A PARTICULAR MARKET. WE OFTEN DO NOT ACQUIRE THE EXISTING FORMAT, OR WE CHANGE THE FORMAT UPON ACQUISITION WHEN WE FIND IT BENEFICIAL. AS A RESULT, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE ASSETS OF A RADIO STATION IS ALLOCATED TO THE BROADCAST LICENSE. UNDER ASU 2017-01, THAT WAS EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2018, A FEWER NUMBER OF OUR RADIO STATION ACQUISITIONS QUALIFY AS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND INSTEAD  62  ARE  ACC  OUNTED FOR AS ASSET PURCHASES.  ASSET PURCHASES A  RE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THEIR COST TO  ACQUIRE,  INCLUD  ING  TRANSACTION COSTS.  THE COST TO ACQUIRE AN ASSET GROUP IS ALLOCATED TO THE INDIVIDUAL ASSETS ACQUIRED BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE FAIR VALU  E WITH NO GOODWILL RECOGNIZED.  WE MAY RETAIN A THIRD-PARTY APPRAISER TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED NET ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. AS PART OF THE VALUATION AND APPRAISAL PROCESS, THE THIRD-PARTY APPRAISER PREPARES A REPORT ASSIGNING ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES TO THE VARIOUS ASSET CATEGORIES IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECTIVE IN NATURE AND REQUIRE CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND JUDGMENT. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THE THIRD-PARTY REPORTS FOR REASONABLENESS OF THE ASSIGNED VALUES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS REPRESENT THE APPROPRIATE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND WE HAVE NOT HAD TO MODIFY OUR PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS.  WE ESTIMATE THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF EACH TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSET ACQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH THE ASSET SHOULD BE DEPRECIATED OR AMORTIZED. A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF EACH ASSET. WE CONSIDER OUR OWN EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR ASSETS, INDUSTRY TRENDS, MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE AGE OF THE PROPERTY AT THE TIME OF OUR ACQUISITION TO ESTIMATE THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF EACH ASSET. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ASSETS WERE TO DETERIORATE, THE RESULTING CHANGE IN LIFE OR IMPAIRMENT OF THE ASSET COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL IMPACT AND VOLATILITY IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC LIFE ESTABLISHED FOR EACH MAJOR CATEGORY OF OUR ASSETS.  CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION  OUR ACQUISITIONS OFTEN INCLUDE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION AS PART OF THE PURCHASE PRICE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION IS ESTIMATED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT PAYMENTS EXPECTED TO BE MADE USING A WEIGHTED PROBABILITY OF POSSIBLE PAYMENTS. THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION INCLUDE OUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF PAYMENT BASED ON THE ESTABLISHED BENCHMARKS AND DISCOUNT RATES  BASED ON OUR INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN ANALYSIS.  THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS INCLUDE INPUTS THAT ARE LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENT AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 15 IN THE NOTES OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN PART 1 IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  WE REVIEW THE PROBABILITIES OF POSSIBLE FUTURE PAYMENTS TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ANY CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OVER THE EARN-OUT PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS ARE COMPARED TO THE ESTIMATES AND PROBABILITIES OF ACHIEVEMENT USED IN OUR FORECASTS. SHOULD ACTUAL RESULTS INCREASE OR DECREASE AS COMPARED TO THE ASSUMPTION USED IN OUR ANALYSIS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION OBLIGATIONS WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE, UP TO THE CONTRACTED LIMIT, AS APPLICABLE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL IMPACT AND VOLATILITY IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  DURING THE PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE RECORDED A NET DECREASE OF $40,000 IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION THAT IS REFLECTED IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THIS PERIOD.  THE CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES REFLECT VOLATILITY FROM VARIABLES, SUCH AS REVENUE GROWTH, PAGE VIEWS AND SESSION TIME AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4 \u2013 CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN PART 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE USED REASONABLE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO CALCULATE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ALL REMAINING CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION HOWEVER, THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL IN NATURE. ACTUAL RESULTS CAN BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  FASB ASC TOPIC 820,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES  ESTABLISHED A SINGLE DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE IN GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE PROVISION APPLIES TO OTHER ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT REQUIRE OR PERMIT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THIS INCLUDES APPLYING THE FAIR VALUE CONCEPT TO (I) NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS; (II) REPORTING UNITS OR NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN CONJUNCTION WITH GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING; (III) OTHER NONFINANCIAL ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN CONJUNCTION WITH IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS; AND (IV) ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE.  THE FAIR VALUE PROVISIONS INCLUDE GUIDANCE ON HOW TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND REEMPHASIZE THAT THE OBJECTIVE OF A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT REMAINS AN EXIT PRICE. IF WE WERE TO CONCLUDE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE VOLUME AND LEVEL OF ACTIVITY OF THE ASSET OR LIABILITY IN RELATION TO NORMAL MARKET ACTIVITIES, QUOTED MARKET VALUES MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF FAIR VALUE AND WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT A CHANGE IN VALUATION TECHNIQUE OR THE USE OF MULTIPLE VALUATION TECHNIQUES MAY BE APPROPRIATE.  THE DEGREE OF JUDGMENT UTILIZED IN MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS GENERALLY CORRELATES TO THE LEVEL OF PRICING OBSERVABILITY. PRICING OBSERVABILITY IS AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE TYPE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT, WHETHER THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS NEW TO THE MARKET, AND THE CHARACTERISTICS SPECIFIC TO THE TRANSACTION. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH READILY AVAILABLE ACTIVE QUOTED PRICES OR FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE CAN BE MEASURED FROM ACTIVELY QUOTED PRICES GENERALLY WILL HAVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF PRICING OBSERVABILITY AND A LESSER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT UTILIZED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE. CONVERSELY, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RARELY TRADED OR NOT QUOTED WILL GENERALLY HAVE LESS (OR NO) PRICING OBSERVABILITY AND A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT UTILIZED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE.  63  FASB  ASC  TOPIC 820 ES  TABLISHED A HIERARCHAL DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEVEL OF PRICING OBSERVABILITY UTILIZED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE. THIS FRAMEWORK DEFINED THREE LEVELS OF INPUTS TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT PROCESS AND REQUIRES THAT EACH FAIR VALUE MEASUREME  NT BE ASSIGNED TO A LEVEL CORRESPONDING TO THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE THREE BROAD LEVELS OF INPUTS DEFINED BY THE FASB ASC TOPIC 820 HIERARCHY ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  LEVEL 1 INPUTS\u2014QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES THAT THE REPORTING ENTITY HAS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE;  \u2022  LEVEL 2 INPUTS\u2014INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES INCLUDED WITHIN LEVEL 1 THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. IF THE ASSET OR LIABILITY HAS A SPECIFIED (CONTRACTUAL) TERM, A LEVEL 2 INPUT MUST BE OBSERVABLE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSET OR LIABILITY; AND  \u2022  LEVEL 3 INPUTS\u2014UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. THESE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT THE ENTITY\u2019S OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY AND ARE DEVELOPED BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES (WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE THE REPORTING ENTITY\u2019S OWN DATA).  WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE USED REASONABLE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO CALCULATE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 15 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN PART 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  CONTINGENCY RESERVES  IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, LAWSUITS, ARBITRATION AND OTHER CLAIMS THAT ARE COMPLEX IN NATURE AND HAVE OUTCOMES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. CONSEQUENTLY, WE ARE UNABLE TO ASCERTAIN THE ULTIMATE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF MONETARY LIABILITY OR THE FINANCIAL IMPACT WITH RESPECT TO THESE MATTERS. CERTAIN OF THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 17, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES, CONTAINED IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE RECORD CONTINGENCY RESERVES TO THE EXTENT WE CONCLUDE THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE RELATED LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RESERVE IS BASED ON A REVIEW OF ALL RELEVANT FACTORS, THE ADVICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT OF MANAGEMENT. THE RESERVES WE HAVE RECORDED TO DATE HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.  WE BELIEVE THAT  OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE AND THAT OUR RESERVES ARE ACCURATELY REFLECTED.  WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF ANY KNOWN MATERS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS, IT IS P  OSSIBLE THAT WE COULD INCUR ADDITIONAL LOSSES.  WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE THAT MAY PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR SUCH MATTERS. FUTURE CLAIMS AGAINST US, WHETHER MERITORIOUS OR NOT, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS, INCLUDING LOSSES DUE TO  COSTLY LITIGATION AND LOSSES DUE TO MATTERS THAT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MANAGEMENT TIME THAT CAN RESULT IN THE DIVERSION OF SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL RESOURCES.  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS  WE EVALUATE THE BALANCE RESERVED IN OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, THE AGE OF THE RECEIVABLES, SPECIFIC CUSTOMER INFORMATION AND CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. PAST DUE BALANCES ARE GENERALLY NOT WRITTEN-OFF UNTIL ALL COLLECTION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL, INCLUDING USE OF A COLLECTIONS AGENCY. A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF THESE RECEIVABLES, INCLUDING THE CURRENT CREDITWORTHINESS OF EACH CUSTOMER. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WERE TO DETERIORATE, RESULTING IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES MAY BE REQUIRED. WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED OUR ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY AND WE HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY RECOGNIZED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE AND THAT OUR RESERVES ARE ACCURATELY REFLECTED.  SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES  WE PROVIDE FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS FOR PRODUCTS SOLD WITH THE RIGHT OF RETURN, PRIMARILY BOOK SALES ASSOCIATED WITH REGNERY  \u00ae  PUBLISHING AND NUTRITIONAL PRODUCTS SOLD THROUGH OUR WELLNESS DIVISION. WE RECORD AN ESTIMATE OF THESE PRODUCT RETURNS AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE IN THE PERIOD OF THE SALE. OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL SALES RETURNS, THE AMOUNT OF CURRENT PERIOD SALES, ECONOMIC TRENDS AND ANY CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEMAND AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR ACTUAL PERFORMANCE TO ESTIMATED RETURN RATES AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY. ESTIMATED RETURN RATES UTILIZED FOR ESTABLISHING ESTIMATED RETURNS RESERVES HAVE APPROXIMATED ACTUAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER, ACTUAL RETURNS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY, EITHER FAVORABLY OR UNFAVORABLY, FROM THESE ESTIMATES IF FACTORS SUCH AS THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USED TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS OR AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THE CUSTOMER AND/OR THE MARKET.  WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED OUR ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY AND WE HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY RECOGNIZED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE AND THAT OUR RESERVES ARE ACCURATELY REFLECTED.  64  INVENTORY  R  ESERVES  INVENTORIES CONSIST OF FINISHED GOODS, INCLUDING PUBLISHED BOOKS AND WELLNESS PRODUCTS. INVENTORY IS RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE AS DETERMINED ON A FIRST-IN FIRST-OUT COST METHOD. WE REVIEWED HISTORICAL DATA ASSOCIATED WITH BOOK AND WELLNESS PRODUCT INVENTORIES HELD BY REGNERY  \u00ae  PUBLISHING AND OUR E-COMMERCE WELLNESS ENTITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN EXPERIENCES TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF INVENTORY ON HAND. OUR ANALYSIS INCLUDES A REVIEW OF ACTUAL SALES RETURNS, OUR ALLOWANCES, ROYALTY RESERVES, OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT DEMAND. WE RECORD A PROVISION TO EXPENSE THE BALANCE OF UNSOLD INVENTORY THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE UNRECOVERABLE. WE REGULARLY MONITOR ACTUAL PERFORMANCE TO OUR ESTIMATES AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY. ESTIMATED INVENTORY RESERVES MAY BE ADJUSTED, EITHER FAVORABLY OR UNFAVORABLY, IF FACTORS SUCH AS THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USED TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS OR AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THE CUSTOMER AND/OR THE MARKET.  WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED OUR ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY AND WE HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY RECOGNIZED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE AND THAT OUR RESERVES ARE ACCURATELY REFLECTED.  RESERVES FOR ROYALTY ADVANCES  ROYALTIES DUE TO BOOK AUTHORS ARE PAID IN ADVANCE AND CAPITALIZED. ROYALTIES ARE EXPENSED AS THE RELATED BOOK REVENUES ARE EARNED OR WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT FUTURE RECOVERY OF THE ROYALTY IS NOT LIKELY. WE REVIEWED HISTORICAL DATA ASSOCIATED WITH ROYALTY ADVANCES, EARNINGS AND RECOVERABILITY BASED ON ACTUAL RESULTS OF REGNERY  \u00ae  PUBLISHING. HISTORICALLY, THE LONGER THE UNEARNED PORTION OF AN ADVANCE REMAINS OUTSTANDING, THE LESS LIKELY IT IS THAT WE WILL RECOVER THE ADVANCE THROUGH THE SALE OF THE BOOK. WE APPLY THIS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE TO OUTSTANDING ROYALTY ADVANCES TO ESTIMATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF RECOVERY. A PROVISION WAS ESTABLISHED TO EXPENSE THE BALANCE OF ANY UNEARNED ADVANCE WHICH WE BELIEVE IS NOT RECOVERABLE. OUR ANALYSIS ALSO CONSIDERS OTHER DISCRETE FACTORS, SUCH AS DEATH OF AN AUTHOR, ANY DECISION TO NOT PURSUE PUBLICATION OF A TITLE, POOR MARKET DEMAND OR OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS.  WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED OUR ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY AND WE HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY RECOGNIZED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE AND THAT OUR RESERVES ARE ACCURATELY REFLECTED.  FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY AWARDS  WE ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF FASB ASC TOPIC 718,  COMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION  . WE RECORD EQUITY AWARDS WITH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION MEASURED AT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AS OF THE GRANT DATE. WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH AWARD USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES VALUATION MODEL THAT REQUIRES THE INPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THE EXPECTED STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED TERM OF THE AWARD GRANTED. THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR EACH AWARD IS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE CLOSING MARKET PRICE OF SALEM MEDIA GROUP, INC. COMMON STOCK AS OF THE DATE OF THE AWARD. WE USE THE STRAIGHT-LINE ATTRIBUTION METHOD TO RECOGNIZE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS OVER THE EXPECTED SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD. UPON EXERCISE, CANCELLATION, FORFEITURE, OR EXPIRATION OF THE AWARD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR AWARDS WITH MULTIPLE VESTING DATES ARE ELIMINATED FOR EACH VESTING PERIOD ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS AS IF EACH VESTING PERIOD WAS A SEPARATE AWARD. WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED OUR ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS USED IN OUR VALUATION MODEL. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE AND THAT OUR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION IS ACCURATELY REFLECTED IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  PARTIAL SELF-INSURANCE ON EMPLOYEE HEALTH PLAN  WE PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES UNDER A SELF-INSURED PLAN WHEREBY WE PAY ACTUAL MEDICAL CLAIMS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN STOP LOSS LIMITS. WE RECORD SELF-INSURANCE LIABILITIES BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIMS FILED AND AN ESTIMATE OF THOSE CLAIMS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED. OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA AND PROBABILITIES. ANY PROJECTION OF LOSSES CONCERNING OUR LIABILITY IS SUBJECT TO A HIGH DEGREE OF VARIABILITY. AMONG THE CAUSES OF THIS VARIABILITY ARE UNPREDICTABLE EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS FUTURE INFLATION RATES, CHANGES IN SEVERITY, BENEFIT LEVEL CHANGES, MEDICAL COSTS AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT PATTERNS. SHOULD THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF CLAIMS INCREASE OR DECREASE BEYOND WHAT WAS ANTICIPATED, WE MAY ADJUST OUR FUTURE RESERVES. OUR SELF-INSURANCE LIABILITY WAS $0.7 MILLION AND $0.8 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED OUR ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY AND WE HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY RECOGNIZED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES.  LEASES  WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 842,  LEASES  (\u201cASC 842\u201d) ISSUED UNDER ASU 2016-02 ON JANUARY 1, 2019. UNDER ASC 842, WE CONSIDER ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, TO DETERMINE  WHETHER A CONTRACT IS OR CONTAINS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. OUR ANALYSIS INCLUDES  WHETHER THE CONTRACT CONVEYS THE RIGHT TO CONTROL THE USE OF AN IDENTIFIED ASSET FOR A PERIOD OF TIME IN EXCHANGE FOR CONSIDERATION. THIS CONSIDERATION INVOLVES JUDGMENT WITH RESPECT TO WHETHER WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM THE USE OF THE IDENTIFIED ASSET AND WHETHER WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DIRECT THE USE OF THE IDENTIFIED ASSET.  LEASE TERM \u2013 IMPACT ON RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES  THE LEASE TERM CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT THE VALUE OF THE RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES RECORDED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AS REQUIRED UNDER ASC 842. WE CALCULATE THE TERM FOR EACH LEASE AGREEMENT TO INCLUDE THE NONCANCELLABLE PERIOD SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT TOGETHER WITH (1) THE PERIODS COVERED BY OPTIONS TO EXTEND THE LEASE IF WE ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE THAT OPTION, (2) PERIODS COVERED BY AN OPTION TO TERMINATE IF WE ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN NOT TO EXERCISE THAT OPTION AND (3) PERIOD COVERED BY AN OPTION TO EXTEND (OR NOT TERMINATE) IF CONTROLLED BY THE LESSOR. THE ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER WE ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE AN OPTION TO EXTEND A LEASE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENT SURROUNDING CONTRACT-BASED FACTORS, ASSET-BASED FACTORS, ENTITY-BASED FACTORS AND MARKET-BASED FACTORS. THESE FACTORS, DETAILED BELOW, ARE EVALUATED BASED ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE TIME WE ENTER A LEASE AGREEMENT.  65  CONTRACT-BASED FACTORS.  \u2022  THE EXISTENCE OF A BARGAIN RENEWAL OPTION  \u2022  THE EXISTENCE OF CONTINGENT OR VARIABLE PAYMENTS  \u2022  THE NATURE AND TERMS OF RENEWAL OR TERMINATION OPTIONS  \u2022  THE COSTS THE LESSEE WOULD INCUR TO RESTORE THE ASSET BEFORE RETURNING IT TO THE LESSOR  ASSET-BASED FACTORS.  \u2022  THE EXISTENCE OF SIGNIFICANT LESSEE-INSTALLED LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS THAT WOULD STILL HAVE ECONOMIC VALUE WHEN THE OPTION BECOMES EXERCISABLE  \u2022  THE PHYSICAL LOCATION OF THE ASSET  \u2022  THE COSTS THAT WOULD BE INCURRED TO REPLACE OR FIND AN ALTERNATIVE ASSET  ENTITY-BASED FACTORS.  \u2022  HISTORICAL PRACTICE  \u2022  MANAGEMENT\u2019S INTENT  \u2022  COMMON INDUSTRY PRACTICE  \u2022  THE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE ENTITY OF EXTENDING OR TERMINATING THE LEASE  \u2022  THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LEASED ASSET TO THE ENTITY\u2019S OPERATIONS  MARKET-BASED FACTORS.  \u2022  MARKET RENTAL OR PURCHASE RATES FOR COMPARABLE ASSETS  \u2022  POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS OF LOCAL REGULATIONS AND STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS  WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED OUR ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY SINCE ADOPTING ASC 842 ON JANUARY 1, 2019.  INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE  THE ROU ASSET AND RELATED LEASE LIABILITIES RECORDED UNDER ASC 842 ARE CALCULATED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE LEASE PAYMENTS USING (1) THE RATE IMPLICIT IN THE LEASE OR (2) THE LESSEE\u2019S INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE (\u201cIBR\u201d). IBR IS DEFINED AS THE RATE OF INTEREST THAT A LESSEE WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO BORROW ON A COLLATERALIZED BASIS OVER A SIMILAR TERM AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LEASE PAYMENTS IN A SIMILAR ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.  WE PERFORMED AN ANALYSIS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019 TO ESTIMATE THE IBR APPLICABLE TO SALEM UPON TRANSITION TO ASC 842. OUR ANALYSIS REQUIRED THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENT AND ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LEASED ASSET, AND THE FOLLOWING AVAILABLE EVIDENCE.  THE CREDIT HISTORY OF SALEM MEDIA GROUP  OUR MOST RECENT CREDIT FACILITY CONSISTED OF 6.75% SENIOR SECURED NOTES AND AN ABL REVOLVER. AS OF EACH MONTH END, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON OUTSTANDING DEBT WAS CALCULATED. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON THE OUTSTANDING DEBT RANGED FROM A LOW OF 2.97% FOR THE ABL TO A HIGH OF 6.75% FOR THE NOTES. ON A COMBINED BASIS, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE FOR THE ABL AND THE NOTES RANGED FROM 99 TO 257 BASIS POINTS ABOVE PRIME.  BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND PREVAILING INTEREST RATES IN 2018 THAT WERE HIGHER THAN OUR NOTES, WE COMPLETED VARIOUS OPEN-MARKET REPURCHASES OF THE NOTES AT PRICES BELOW FACE VALUE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE NOTES WERE TRADING AT 91.5% OF THE FACE VALUE.  THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF SALEM MEDIA GROUP  AT JANUARY 1, 2019, OUR MOODY\u2019S RATING WAS \u201cB2,\u201d CONSISTENT WITH THE LAST TEN YEARS. A B2 CREDIT RATING IS CONSIDERED SPECULATIVE IN NATURE AND SUBJECT TO HIGH CREDIT RISK.  CLASS OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET AND THE REMAINING TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENT  WE ELECTED TO USE A PORTFOLIO APPROACH APPLYING A SINGLE IBR TO LEASES WITH REASONABLY SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING THE REMAINING LEASE TERM, THE UNDERLYING ASSETS AND THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. AS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION, WE GROUPED EACH LEASE ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF LEASED ASSET AND FURTHER GROUPED THE ITEMS BY THE REMAINING LEASE TERM AS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION. WE HAVE SIX MAIN CATEGORIES OF LEASES, (1) BUILDINGS, (2) EQUIPMENT, (3) LAND, (4) OTHER (PARKING FACILITIES), (5) TOWERS AND (6) VEHICLES.  WE CONSIDERED VEHICLES TO HAVE A HIGHER RISK FOR COLLATERAL THAT IS MITIGATED BY THE SHORTER TERM OF THE LEASE THAT WOULD TYPICALLY RANGE FROM THREE TO FIVE YEARS. WE CONSIDERED BUILDING AND TOWERS TO HAVE A HIGHER RISK BASED ON (1) THE LONGER LEASE TERM OF UP TO THIRTY YEARS AND (2) A HIGHER OUTSTANDING BALANCE THAT IS MITIGATED BY THE LOWER RISK THAT THE COLLATERALIZED ASSET WOULD LOSE SIGNIFICANT VALUE.  66  THE DEBT INCURRED UNDER THE LEASE LIABILITY AS COMPARED  TO AMOUNTS THAT WOULD BE BORROWED  WE REVIEWED THE COST TO FINANCE COMPARABLE AMOUNTS UNDER OUR ABL AND BASED ON THE CURRENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT AS DERIVED FROM AVAILABLE ECONOMIC DATA.  WE REFERRED TO THE BLOOMBERG SINGLE B RATED COMMUNICATIONS YIELD CURVE (UNSECURED) AND CONSIDERED ADJUSTMENTS FOR INDUSTRY RISK FACTORS AND THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LEASED ASSET TO BE COLLATERAL FOR THE DEBT INCURRED.  FROM THIS ANALYSIS, WE DEVELOPED A MATRIX TO ESTIMATE THE IBR FOR EACH MAJOR CATEGORY OF LEASES. WE WILL REVIEW OUR IBR ESTIMATES ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND UPDATE AS NECESSARY. WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED OUR ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY SINCE ADOPTING ASC 842 ON JANUARY 1, 2019.  INCOME TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES (DEFERRED TAXES)  IN PREPARING OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ESTIMATE OUR INCOME TAX LIABILITY IN EACH OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE BY ESTIMATING OUR ACTUAL CURRENT TAX EXPOSURE AND ASSESSING TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULTING FROM DIFFERING TREATMENT OF ITEMS FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES. OUR JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX CONSIDER CURRENT TAX LAWS, OUR INTERPRETATION OF CURRENT TAX LAWS AND POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF AUDITS CONDUCTED BY TAX AUTHORITIES. RESERVES FOR INCOME TAXES TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL EXPOSURES INVOLVING TAX POSITIONS THAT COULD BE CHALLENGED BY TAX AUTHORITIES ARE ESTABLISHED IF NECESSARY. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR OUR INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAWS AND THE RESOLUTION OF ANY FUTURE TAX AUDITS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE AMOUNTS PROVIDED FOR INCOME TAXES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE CALCULATE OUR CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAX PROVISIONS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT COULD DIFFER FROM THE ACTUAL RESULTS REFLECTED IN INCOME TAX RETURNS FILED DURING THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR. ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON FILED RETURNS ARE GENERALLY RECORDED IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE TAX RETURNS ARE FILED AND THE TAX IMPLICATIONS ARE KNOWN. TAX LAW AND RATE CHANGES ARE REFLECTED IN THE INCOME TAX PROVISION IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES ARE ENACTED.  WE RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, INCLUDING HISTORICAL LEVELS OF INCOME, EXPECTATIONS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ESTIMATES OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND ONGOING PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES IN ASSESSING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO DETERMINE THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE ALL OR PART OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN THE FUTURE, AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MAKE SUCH A DETERMINATION. LIKEWISE, IF WE LATER DETERMINE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD BE REALIZED, WE WOULD REVERSE THE APPLICABLE PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  AS A RESULT OF OUR ADJUSTED CUMULATIVE THREE-YEAR PRE-TAX BOOK LOSS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE PERFORMED A REVIEW OF OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE. WE RECORDED AN INCREASE TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $5.4 MILLION, FOR A TOTAL VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $10.8 MILLION.  INCOME TAXES AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS  WE ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT AND REVIEW BY VARIOUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. WE MAY RECOGNIZE LIABILITIES ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR POSITIONS TAKEN ON UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. WHEN TAX RETURNS ARE FILED, IT IS HIGHLY CERTAIN THAT SOME POSITIONS TAKEN WOULD BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, WHILE OTHERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE MERITS OF THE POSITION TAKEN OR THE AMOUNT OF THE POSITION THAT WOULD BE ULTIMATELY SUSTAINED. SUCH POSITIONS ARE DEEMED TO BE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY IS ESTABLISHED ON THE BALANCE SHEET.  IT IS INHERENTLY DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE TO ESTIMATE SUCH AMOUNTS, AS THIS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES BASED ON THE VARIOUS POSSIBLE OUTCOMES.  THE BENEFIT OF A TAX POSITION IS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH, BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, WE BELIEVE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION, INCLUDING THE RESOLUTION OF APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, IF ANY.  WE REVIEW AND REEVALUATE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS MAY RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF A TAX BENEFIT OR AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO THE TAX PROVISION. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE NO LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS RECORDED AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. OUR EVALUATION WAS PERFORMED FOR ALL TAX YEARS THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION, WHICH RANGE FROM 2014 THROUGH 2017. THERE IS CURRENTLY ONE TAX EXAMINATION IN PROCESS. IN AUGUST 10, 2017, THE CITY OF NEW YORK BEGAN ITS AUDIT OF SALEM\u2019S 2013 AND 2014 TAX FILINGS. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL OR SIGNIFICANT RESULTS FROM THE AUDIT.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF FUNDS ARE OPERATING CASH FLOWS, BORROWINGS UNDER CREDIT FACILITIES AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SELECTED ASSETS OR BUSINESSES. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY FUNDED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO FUND, EXPENDITURES FOR OPERATIONS, ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FROM THESE SOURCES. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY FINANCED ACQUISITIONS THROUGH BORROWINGS, INCLUDING BORROWINGS UNDER CREDIT FACILITIES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, FROM OPERATING CASH FLOW AND FROM PROCEEDS ON SELECTED ASSET DISPOSITIONS. WE EXPECT TO FUND FUTURE ACQUISITIONS FROM CASH ON HAND, BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, OPERATING CASH FLOW AND POSSIBLY THROUGH THE SALE OF INCOME-PRODUCING ASSETS OR PROCEEDS FROM DEBT AND EQUITY OFFERINGS. WE HAVE ASSESSED THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND OUR CURRENT AND EXPECTED NEEDS FOR FUNDS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CURRENT CREDIT FACILITIES ALLOWS US  67  TO MEET OUR ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS, FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AN  D SATISFY OUR DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, INCLUDING OUR WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AT  SEPTEMBER 30  ,  2019.  GENERALLY, WE KEEP THE BALANCE OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS LOW IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE BALANCE OF OUTSTANDING DEBT. OUR ABL FACILITY AUTOMATICALLY COVERS ANY SHORTFALLS IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS SUCH THAT WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HOLD EXCESS CASH BALANCES ON HAND. OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED TO $7,000 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $0.1 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED $4.8 MILLION TO $(4.4 MILLION) AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO ($9.2 MILLION) AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 DUE TO THE RECOGNITION OF ROU ASSETS OF $9.5 MILLION, THE DERECOGNITION OF PREPAID RENT OF $1.1 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES OF $3.6 MILLION AND A $1.6 MILLION DECREASE IN THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON THE ABL.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS  OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF OPERATING CASH INFLOWS ARE RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS IN EXCHANGE FOR ADVERTISING AND PROGRAMMING. OTHER SOURCES OF OPERATING CASH INFLOWS INCLUDE RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS FOR DIGITAL DOWNLOADS AND STREAMING, BOOK SALES, SUBSCRIPTIONS, SELF-PUBLISHING FEES, TICKET SALES, SPONSORSHIPS, AND VENDOR PROMOTIONS. A MAJORITY OF OUR OPERATING CASH OUTFLOWS CONSIST OF PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, SUCH AS SALARIES AND BENEFITS, AND VENDOR PAYMENTS UNDER FACILITY AND TOWER LEASES, TALENT AGREEMENTS, INVENTORY PURCHASES AND RECURRING SERVICES SUCH AS UTILITIES AND MUSIC LICENSE FEES. OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS ARE  SUBJECT TO FACTORS SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN PREFERRED ADVERTISING MEDIA AND CHANGES IN DEMAND CAUSED  BY SHIFTS IN POPULATION, STATION LISTENERSHIP, DEMOGRAPHICS, AND AUDIENCE TASTES. IN ADDITION, OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS MAY BE AFFECTED IF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE UNABLE TO PAY, DELAY PAYMENT OF AMOUNTS OWED TO US, OR IF WE EXPERIENCE REDUCTIONS IN REVENUE, OR INCREASES IN COSTS AND EXPENSES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 DECREASED BY $5.7 MILLION TO $14.5 MILLION COMPARED TO $20.2 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVED TO A $4.4 MILLION DEFICIT FROM A $9.2 MILLION DEFICIT DUE TO THE $7.8 MILLION SHORT-TERM RECEIVABLE FROM STATION SALES THAT CLOSED ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2019. THE DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS.  \u2022  TOTAL NET REVENUE DECLINED BY $6.3 MILLION,  \u2022  OPERATING EXPENSES EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION, IMPAIRMENTS AND NET GAIN (LOSS) ON THE DISPOSITION OF ASSETS, DECREASED BY $0.2 MILLION;  \u2022  TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES, NET OF ALLOWANCES, INCREASED BY $0.4 MILLION COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF $2.5 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO A CHANGE IN OUR REGNERY PUBLISHING DISTRIBUTOR ARRANGEMENT UNDER WHICH THERE IS A SIX MONTH HOLD BACK ON PAYMENT PENDING THE PROCESSING OF RETURNS;  \u2022  UNBILLED REVENUE DECREASED $0.2 MILLION;  \u2022  OUR DAY\u2019S SALES OUTSTANDING, OR THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS TO COLLECT CASH FROM THE DATE OF SALE, DECREASED TO 64 DAYS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 68 DAYS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2018;  \u2022  NET ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES INCREASED $3.6 MILLION TO $23.5 MILLION FROM $25.0 MILLION AS OF THE PRIOR YEAR; AND  \u2022  NET INVENTORIES ON HAND DECREASED $28,000 TO $0.6 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF $0.2 MILLION TO $0.9 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  INVESTING CASH FLOWS  OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF INVESTING CASH INFLOWS INCLUDES PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS OR BUSINESSES. INVESTING CASH OUTFLOWS INCLUDE CASH PAYMENTS MADE TO ACQUIRE BUSINESSES, TO ACQUIRE PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND TO ACQUIRE INTANGIBLE ASSETS SUCH AS DOMAIN NAMES. WHILE OUR FOCUS CONTINUES TO BE ON DELEVERAGING THE COMPANY, WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO EXPLORE AND PURSUE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS.  IN RECENT YEARS, WE ENTERED ACQUISITION AGREEMENTS THAT CONTAIN CONTINGENT EARN-OUT ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE PAYABLE IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PREDEFINED OPERATING RESULTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT ARRANGEMENTS PROVIDE SOME DEGREE OF PROTECTION WITH REGARD TO OUR CASH OUTFLOWS SHOULD THESE ACQUISITIONS NOT MEET OUR OPERATIONAL EXPECTATIONS.  WE UNDERTAKE PROJECTS FROM TIME TO TIME TO UPGRADE OUR RADIO STATION TECHNICAL FACILITIES AND/OR FCC BROADCAST LICENSES, EXPAND OUR DIGITAL AND WEB-BASED OFFERINGS, IMPROVE OUR FACILITIES AND UPGRADE OUR COMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURES. THE NATURE AND TIMING OF THESE UPGRADES AND EXPENDITURES CAN BE DELAYED OR SCALED BACK AT THE DISCRETION OF MANAGEMENT. BASED ON OUR CURRENT PLANS, WE EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.7 MILLION DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  WE PLAN TO FUND FUTURE PURCHASES AND ANY ACQUISITIONS FROM CASH ON HAND, OPERATING CASH FLOW OR OUR CREDIT FACILITIES.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $5.4 MILLION TO $3.9 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 FROM $9.3 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS THE RESULT OF.  \u2022  CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS DECREASED $9.6 MILLION TO $1.3 MILLION COMPARED TO $10.9 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR;  \u2022  CASH PAID FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DECREASED $0.4 MILLION TO $6.1 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 FROM $6.5 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR, AND  \u2022  RECEIPTS FROM ASSET SALES WERE $4.2 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $8.5 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR;  68  FINANCING CASH FLOWS  FINANCING CASH INFLOWS INCLUDE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AND ANY PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED UNDER OUR STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN. FINANCING CASH OUTFLOWS INCLUDE REPAYMENTS OF OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, THE PAYMENT OF EQUITY DISTRIBUTIONS AND PAYMENTS OF AMOUNTS DUE UNDER DEFERRED INSTALLMENTS AND CONTINGENCY EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITION ACTIVITY.  DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE PRINCIPAL BALANCES OUTSTANDING UNDER THE NOTES AND ABL FACILITY RANGED FROM $244.4 MILLION TO $258.2 MILLION. THESE OUTSTANDING BALANCES WERE ORDINARY AND CUSTOMARY BASED ON OUR OPERATING AND INVESTING CASH NEEDS DURING THIS TIME.  ANY FUTURE EQUITY DISTRIBUTIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE COMPARABLE TO PRIOR DECLARATIONS UNLESS THERE ARE CHANGES IN EXPECTED FUTURE EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF CLASS A AND CLASS B COMMON STOCK CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING WE EXPECT TO PAY TOTAL ANNUAL EQUITY DISTRIBUTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $6.9 MILLION IN 2019. HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS AND EQUITY DISTRIBUTIONS, AS WELL AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PER SHARE AMOUNTS, DATES OF RECORD, AND PAYMENT DATES ARE SUBJECT TO FINAL DETERMINATION BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DEPEND UPON FUTURE EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, AND OTHER FACTORS.  OUR SOLE SOURCE OF CASH AVAILABLE FOR MAKING ANY FUTURE EQUITY DISTRIBUTIONS IS OUR OPERATING CASH FLOW, SUBJECT TO OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AND NOTES, WHICH CONTAIN COVENANTS THAT RESTRICT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND EQUITY DISTRIBUTIONS UNLESS CERTAIN SPECIFIED CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $0.2 MILLION TO $10.7 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 FROM $10.9 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCLUDES.  \u2022  A $0.5 MILLION DECREASE IN THE BOOK OVERDRAFT TO $2.3 MILLION FROM $2.8 MILLION OF THE PRIOR YEAR;  \u2022  WE USED $6.1 MILLION OF CASH TO REPURCHASE $6.7 MILLION IN FACE VALUE OF THE 6.75% SENIOR SECURED NOTES COMPARED TO $9.5 MILLION OF CASH TO REPURCHASE $10.0 MILLION THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR; AND  \u2022  NET BORROWINGS ON OUR ABL FACILITY WERE $1.6 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO NET PROCEEDS OF $1.2 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  SALEM MEDIA GROUP, INC. HAS NO INDEPENDENT ASSETS OR OPERATIONS, THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES RELATING TO CERTAIN DEBT ARE FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL AND JOINT AND SEVERAL, AND ANY SUBSIDIARIES OF SALEM MEDIA GROUP, INC. OTHER THAN THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS ARE MINOR.  6.75% SENIOR SECURED NOTES  ON MAY 19, 2017, WE ISSUED IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT THE NOTES, WHICH ARE GUARANTEED ON A SENIOR SECURED BASIS BY OUR EXISTING SUBSIDIARIES (THE \u201cSUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS\u201d). THE NOTES BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE OF 6.75% PER YEAR AND MATURE ON JUNE 1, 2024, UNLESS THEY ARE EARLIER REDEEMED OR REPURCHASED. INTEREST INITIALLY ACCRUED ON THE NOTES FROM MAY 19, 2017 AND IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY, IN CASH IN ARREARS, ON JUNE 1 AND DECEMBER 1 OF EACH YEAR, COMMENCING DECEMBER 1, 2017.  THE NOTES ARE SECURED BY A FIRST-PRIORITY LIEN ON SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ASSETS OF OURS AND THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS (THE \u201cNOTES PRIORITY COLLATERAL\u201d). THERE IS NO DIRECT LIEN ON OUR FCC LICENSES TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW OR REGULATION.  WE MAY REDEEM THE NOTES, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME ON OR BEFORE JUNE 1, 2020 AT A PRICE EQUAL TO 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES PLUS A \u201cMAKE-WHOLE\u201d PREMIUM AS OF, AND ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, IF ANY, TO, BUT NOT INCLUDING, THE REDEMPTION DATE. AT ANY TIME ON OR AFTER JUNE 1, 2020, WE MAY REDEEM SOME OR ALL OF THE NOTES AT THE REDEMPTION PRICES (EXPRESSED AS PERCENTAGES OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT TO BE REDEEMED) SET FORTH IN THE NOTES, PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, IF ANY, TO, BUT NOT INCLUDING, THE REDEMPTION DATE. IN ADDITION, WE MAY REDEEM UP TO 35% OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES BEFORE JUNE 1, 2020 WITH THE NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM CERTAIN EQUITY OFFERINGS AT A REDEMPTION PRICE OF 106.75% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, IF ANY, TO, BUT NOT INCLUDING, THE REDEMPTION DATE. WE MAY ALSO REDEEM UP TO 10% OF THE AGGREGATE ORIGINAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES PER TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD BEFORE JUNE 1, 2020 AT A REDEMPTION PRICE OF 103% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST TO, BUT NOT INCLUDING, THE REDEMPTION DATE.  THE INDENTURE RELATING TO THE NOTES (THE \u201cINDENTURE\u201d) CONTAINS COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS AND SUBJECT IN EACH CASE TO CERTAIN SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, LIMIT OUR ABILITY AND THE ABILITY OF OUR RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES TO: (I) INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT; (II) DECLARE OR PAY DIVIDENDS, REDEEM STOCK OR MAKE OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS; (III) MAKE INVESTMENTS; (IV) CREATE LIENS OR USE ASSETS AS SECURITY IN OTHER TRANSACTIONS; (V) MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE, OR SELL, TRANSFER, LEASE OR DISPOSE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS; (VI) ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; AND (VII) SELL OR TRANSFER ASSETS.  THE INDENTURE PROVIDES FOR THE FOLLOWING EVENTS OF DEFAULT (EACH, AN \u201cEVENT OF DEFAULT\u201d): (I) DEFAULT IN PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OR PREMIUM ON THE NOTES AT MATURITY, UPON REPURCHASE, ACCELERATION, OPTIONAL REDEMPTION OR OTHERWISE; (II) DEFAULT FOR 30 DAYS IN PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON THE NOTES; (III) THE FAILURE BY US OR CERTAIN RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES TO COMPLY WITH OTHER AGREEMENTS IN THE INDENTURE OR THE NOTES, IN CERTAIN CASES SUBJECT TO NOTICE AND LAPSE OF TIME; (IV) THE FAILURE OF ANY GUARANTEE BY CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS TO BE IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT AND ENFORCEABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS TERMS, SUBJECT TO NOTICE AND LAPSE OF TIME; (V) CERTAIN ACCELERATIONS (INCLUDING FAILURE TO PAY WITHIN ANY GRACE PERIOD) OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF OURS OR ANY RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARY IF  69  THE AMOUNT ACCELERATED (OR SO UNPAID) IS AT LEAST $15 MILLION; (VI) CERTAIN JUDGMENTS FOR THE PAYM  ENT OF MONEY IN EXCESS OF $15 MILLION; (VII) CERTAIN EVENTS OF BANKRUPTCY OR INSOLVENCY WITH RESPECT TO US OR ANY SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARY; AND (VII) CERTAIN DEFAULTS WITH RESPECT TO ANY COLLATERAL HAVING A FAIR MARKET VALUE IN EXCESS OF $15 MILLION. IF AN E  VENT OF DEFAULT OCCURS AND IS CONTINUING, THE TRUSTEE OR THE HOLDERS OF AT LEAST 25% IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE OUTSTANDING NOTES MAY DECLARE THE PRINCIPAL OF THE NOTES AND ANY ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE NOTES TO BE DUE AND PAYABLE IMMEDIATELY, SUBJECT TO REM  EDY OR CURE IN CERTAIN CASES. CERTAIN EVENTS OF BANKRUPTCY OR INSOLVENCY ARE EVENTS OF DEFAULT WHICH WILL RESULT IN THE NOTES BEING DUE AND PAYABLE IMMEDIATELY UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  BASED ON THE BALANCE OF THE NOTES CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY $15.7 MILLION PER YEAR IN INTEREST ON THE NOTES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE NOTES WAS $5.2 MILLION.  WE INCURRED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS OF $6.3 MILLION THAT WERE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF THE DEBT PROCEEDS THAT ARE BEING AMORTIZED TO NON-CASH INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIFE OF THE NOTES USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, $0.2 MILLION AND $0.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOTES WAS AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, $0.2 MILLION AND $0.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOTES WAS AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE.  WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRICES, CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS, OUR FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND OTHER FACTORS, SEEK TO REPURCHASE THE NOTES IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, BY TENDER OFFER OR OTHERWISE, AS  MARKET CONDITIONS WARRANT.  BASED ON THE THEN EXISTING MARKET CONDITIONS, WE COMPLETED REPURCHASES OF OUR 6.75% SENIOR SECURED NOTES AT AMOUNTS LESS THAN FACE VALUE AS FOLLOWS.

WE USED THE PROCEEDS OF THE ABL FACILITY, TOGETHER WITH THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE NOTES OFFERING, TO REPAY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR PREVIOUSLY EXISTING SENIOR CREDIT FACILITIES, AND RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES. CURRENT PROCEEDS FROM THE ABL FACILITY ARE USED TO PROVIDE ONGOING WORKING CAPITAL AND FOR OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING PERMITTED ACQUISITIONS.  THE ABL FACILITY IS A FIVE-YEAR $30.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DUE MAY 19, 2022, WHICH INCLUDES A $5.0 MILLION SUBFACILITY FOR STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND A $7.5 MILLION SUBFACILITY FOR SWINGLINE LOANS. ALL BORROWINGS UNDER THE ABL FACILITY ACCRUE AT A RATE EQUAL TO A BASE RATE OR LIBOR RATE PLUS A SPREAD. THE SPREAD, WHICH IS BASED ON AN AVAILABILITY-BASED MEASURE, RANGES FROM 0.50% TO 1.00% FOR BASE RATE BORROWINGS AND 1.50% TO 2.00% FOR LIBOR RATE BORROWINGS. IF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT OCCURS, THE INTEREST RATE MAY INCREASE BY 2.00% PER ANNUM. AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE ABL FACILITY MAY BE PAID AND THEN REBORROWED AT OUR D  ISCRETION WITHOUT PENALTY OR PREMIUM. ADDITIONALLY, WE PAY A COMMITMENT FEE ON THE UNUSED BALANCE FROM 0.25% TO 0.375% PER YEAR BASED ON THE LEVEL OF BORROWINGS. THE LIBOR RATE SCHEDULED TO BE DISCONTINUED AT THE END OF CALENDAR YEAR 2021 WOULD RESULT IN ALL OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS SUBJECT TO THE HIGHER BASE RATE BORROWING. WE EXPECT TO AMEND THE ABL PRIOR TO THE LIBOR PHASEOUT BASED ON THE ABL MATURITY DATE OF MAY 19, 2022.  AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL IS SUBJECT TO A BORROWING BASE CONSISTING OF (A) 85% OF THE ELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PLUS (B) A CALCULATED AMOUNT BASED ON THE VALUE OF CERTAIN REAL PROPERTY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER THE ABL WAS $26.2 MILLION OF WHICH $18.1 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING.  THE ABL FACILITY HAS A FIRST-PRIORITY LIEN ON OUR AND THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS\u2019 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY, DEPOSIT AND SECURITIES ACCOUNTS, CERTAIN REAL ESTATE AND RELATED ASSETS (THE \u201cABL PRIORITY  70  COLLATERAL\u201d) AND BY A SECOND-PRIORITY LIEN ON THE NOTES PRIORITY COLLATERAL. THERE  IS NO DIRECT LIEN ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FCC LICENSES TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW OR REGULATION (OTHER THAN THE ECONOMIC VALUE AND PROCEEDS THEREOF).  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES A SPRINGING FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF 1.0 TO 1.0, WHICH IS TESTED DURING THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE LAST DAY OF THE FISCAL MONTH MOST RECENTLY ENDED PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH AVAILABILITY (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) IS LESS THAN THE GREATER OF 15% OF THE MAXIMUM REVOLVER AMOUNT (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) AND $4.5 MILLION AND CONTINUING FOR A PERIOD OF 60 CONSECUTIVE DAYS AFTER THE FIRST DAY ON WHICH AVAILABILITY EXCEEDS SUCH THRESHOLD AMOUNT. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES OTHER NEGATIVE COVENANTS THAT ARE CUSTOMARY FOR CREDIT FACILITIES OF THIS TYPE, INCLUDING COVENANTS THAT, SUBJECT TO EXCEPTIONS DESCRIBED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF THE BORROWERS AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES (I) TO INCUR ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS; (II) TO MAKE INVESTMENTS; (III) TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS, LOANS OR TRANSFERS OF ASSETS; (IV) TO ENTER INTO, CREATE, INCUR, ASSUME OR SUFFER TO EXIST ANY LIENS, (V) TO SELL ASSETS; (VI) TO ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; (VII) TO MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH, OR DISPOSE OF ALL ASSETS TO A THIRD PARTY, EXCEPT AS PERMITTED THEREBY; (VIII) TO PREPAY INDEBTEDNESS; AND (IX) TO PAY DIVIDENDS.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR THE FOLLOWING EVENTS OF DEFAULT: (I) DEFAULT FOR NON-PAYMENT OF ANY PRINCIPAL OR LETTER OF CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT WHEN DUE OR ANY INTEREST, FEES OR OTHER AMOUNTS WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF THE DUE DATE; (II) THE FAILURE BY ANY BORROWER OR ANY SUBSIDIARY TO COMPLY WITH ANY COVENANT OR AGREEMENT CONTAINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, IN CERTAIN CASES SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE NOTICE AND LAPSE OF TIME; (III) ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE PURSUANT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT IS INCORRECT IN ANY MATERIAL RESPECT WHEN MADE; (IV) CERTAIN DEFAULTS OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF ANY BORROWER OR ANY SUBSIDIARY OF INDEBTEDNESS OF AT LEAST $10 MILLION; (V) CERTAIN EVENTS OF BANKRUPTCY OR INSOLVENCY WITH RESPECT TO ANY BORROWER OR ANY SUBSIDIARY; (VI) CERTAIN JUDGMENTS FOR THE PAYMENT OF MONEY OF $10 MILLION OR MORE; (VII) A CHANGE OF CONTROL; AND (VIII) CERTAIN DEFAULTS RELATING TO THE LOSS OF FCC LICENSES, CESSATION OF BROADCASTING AND TERMINATION OF MATERIAL STATION CONTRACTS. IF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT OCCURS AND IS CONTINUING, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS MAY ACCELERATE THE AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE ABL FACILITY AND MAY EXERCISE REMEDIES IN RESPECT OF THE COLLATERAL.  WE INCURRED DEBT ISSUE COSTS OF $0.8MILLION THAT WERE RECORDED AS AN ASSET AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED TO NON-CASH INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE ABL FACILITY USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, $50,000 AND $0.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF DEBT ISSUE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOTES WAS AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, $53,000 AND $0.2 MILLION OF DEBT ISSUE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOTES WAS RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST EXPENSE. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE BLENDED INTEREST RATE ON AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE ABL FACILITY WAS 4.11%.  WE REPORT OUTSTANDING BALANCES ON THE ABL FACILITY AS SHORT-TERM REGARDLESS OF THE MATURITY DATE BASED ON USE OF THE ABL FACILITY TO FUND ORDINARY AND CUSTOMARY OPERATING CASH NEEDS WITH FREQUENT REPAYMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY ALLOWS US TO MEET OUR ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS, FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND SATISFY OUR DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.

IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET OVER ITS FAIR VALUE. INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE FINITE USEFUL LIVES CONTINUE TO BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES AND ARE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THEY MAY BE IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS OPERATING EXPENSES. WE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT LOSSES IN PRIOR YEARS WITH REGARD TO OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE OF THE VALUE OF OUR BROADCAST LICENSES, MASTHEADS, AND GOODWILL IS A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE AS THE VALUE IS SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO OUR TOTAL ASSETS, AND OUR ESTIMATES INCORPORATE VARIABLES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCES AND JUDGMENT ABOUT FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR MARKETS AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS. IF ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WE USED, WE ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL. THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS USE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT REFLECT OUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE ESTIMATES THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE INCLUDING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT RISK. THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE DEFINED IN FASB ASC TOPIC 820,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES,  AS LEVEL 3 INPUTS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN NOTE 15.  THE VALUATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS SUBJECTIVE AND BASED ON ESTIMATES RATHER THAN PRECISE CALCULATIONS. THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS USE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT REFLECT OUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE ESTIMATES THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE INCLUDING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT RISK. IF ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WE USED, WE ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL.

DEFERRED  INCOME TAXES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX  EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND TAX  BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES GIVEN THE PROVISIONS OF ENACTED TAX  LAWS. IN PROVIDING FOR DEFERRED TAXES, WE CONSIDER TAX REGULATIONS  OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE  TAXABLE INCOME AND AVAILABLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES.

REVENUE  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE ENTIRE LINE OF WORKSPORT PRODUCTS WAS $870,053 AND $1,959,027, COMPARED  TO $5,954 AND $300,113 FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  553% WAS MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF INVENTORY TO SATISFY CUSTOMER ORDERS.  FOR  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, REVENUE GENERATED IN CANADA WAS $74,058 COMPARED TO $32,483 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018,  AN INCREASE OF 56%. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, REVENUE GENERATED IN CANADA WAS $49,410 COMPARED TO REFUNDS  OF $6,059 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, AN INCREASE OF 6425%. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASED HIGHER DEMAND IN CANADA,  RESULTING IN CANADIAN MARKET SALES TO INCREASE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED. THE RATE OF EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR AND  THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR DURING THE NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 WAS CONSISTENT, WHICH LIMITED THE HISTORICALLY NEGATIVE EFFECT  ON REPORTED REVENUES AS A RESULT OF TRANSLATING THE SALES DENOMINATED IN CANADIAN DOLLARS TO UNITED STATES DOLLARS FOR FINANCIAL  STATEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, GROSS REVENUE GENERATED IN THE UNITED STATES WAS $2,072,963  COMPARED TO $259,621 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, AN INCREASE OF 1176%. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, GROSS REVENUE  GENERATED IN THE UNITED STATES WAS $924,949 COMPARED TO $4,986 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, AN INCREASE OF 17839%. THIS IS PRIMARILY  ATTRIBUTABLE TO RE-ENTERING THE US MARKET AS OF MID-2018 AND CONTINUING TO INCREASE SALES WHICH INCLUDED ONLINE RETAILERS AND  THE SUPPORT OF FOUR PRIVATE LABELS, AFTER THE ALLOWANCE OF USE OF THE WORKSPORT TRADEMARK.  CURRENTLY,  WORKSPORT WORKS CLOSELY WITH ONE MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR IN CANADA, ALONG WITH ITS OWN CONTRACTED DISTRIBUTION AND INVENTORY FACILITY  IN BREINIGSVILLE, PA AND DEPEW, NY. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT ONLINE RETAILERS.  ALTHOUGH  WORKSPORT CURRENTLY SUPPORTS A TOTAL OF 10 DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WORKSPORT BELIEVES THE TREND OF INCREASING SALES THROUGH  ONLINE RETAILERS WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE THE TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS MODEL. MOREOVER, REPUTABLE ONLINE RETAILER\u2019S  CUSTOMERS TEND TO PROVIDE LARGER SALES VOLUMES, GREATER MARGIN OF PROFIT AS WELL AS GREATER PROTECTION AGAINST PRICE EROSION.  COST  OF SALES  COST OF SALES INCREASED FOR THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, WHEN COMPARED TO THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2018, BY 1,132% AND 383% FROM  $54,270 AND $305,273 TO $668,516 AND $1,473,150. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE HIGHER VOLUME OF SALES FOR  THE FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF 2019 WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018. OUR COST OF SALES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF  SALES, WAS APPROXIMATELY 77% AND 75% COMPARE TO 911% AND 102% FOR THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  WITHIN  COST OF SALES, FREIGHT COSTS ACCOUNTED FOR 2% OF COST OF SALES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHEREAS IN 2018,  IT ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OF COST OF SALES. THE DECREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF COST OF SALES IS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN SALES FOR THE  QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 BEING LARGER US ORDERS WITH ECONOMIES TO SCALE IN SHIPPING. ALSO, IN 2019, RETAIL ONLINE ORDERS  WERE DROP-SHIPPED SALES FOB CHINA TO OUR ONLINE VENDORS REDUCING INTERMEDIARY COSTS.  12  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WORKSPORT  PROVIDES ITS DISTRIBUTORS AND ONLINE RETAILERS AN \u201cALL-IN\u201d WHOLESALE PRICE.

OVERVIEW  THE  COMPANY WAS FORMED IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA ON JULY 13, 1993 AND WAS A CLOSED-END INVESTMENT COMPANY LICENSED BY THE SBA  AS A SBIC. THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY MADE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN, AND PROVIDED LOANS TO, SMALL BUSINESSES TO FINANCE THEIR GROWTH,  EXPANSION, AND DEVELOPMENT. UNDER APPLICABLE SBA REGULATIONS, THE COMPANY WAS RESTRICTED TO INVESTING ONLY IN QUALIFIED SMALL  BUSINESSES AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT ACT OF 1958. AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT  COMPANY ACT, THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE WAS TO PROVIDE ITS SHAREHOLDERS WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF INCOME, WITH CAPITAL  APPRECIATION AS A SECONDARY OBJECTIVE. THE COMPANY MADE ITS FIRST INVESTMENT IN A SMALL BUSINESS IN OCTOBER 1996.  15  IN  MAY 2014 THE COMPANY EFFECTIVELY CEASED OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY CONSENTED TO A COURT ORDER APPOINTING THE SBA AS RECEIVER OF THE  COMPANY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARSHALING AND LIQUIDATING IN AN ORDERLY MANNER ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS. THAT ORDER ALSO  ENTERED JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ON BEHALF OF THE SBA, AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE AMOUNT OF $11,770,722.  THE SBA WAS APPOINTED RECEIVER EFFECTIVE MAY 28, 2014.  OVER  THE COURSE OF THE RECEIVERSHIP THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMPANY WAS LIMITED TO THE LIQUIDATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS BY THE  RECEIVER AND THE PAYMENT OF THE PROCEEDS THEREFROM TO THE SBA AND FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE RECEIVERSHIP. THE SBIC LICENSE GRANTED  TO THE COMPANY BY THE SBA WAS REVOKED BY THE SBA EFFECTIVE MARCH 20, 2017. ON JUNE 28, 2017 THE RECEIVERSHIP WAS TERMINATED. THE  FINAL ORDER SPECIFICALLY STATED THAT \u201cCONTROL OF WATERSIDE SHALL BE UNCONDITIONALLY TRANSFERRED AND RETURNED TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS  C/O RORAN CAPITAL, LLC (\u201cRORAN\u201d) UPON NOTIFICATION OF ENTRY OF THIS ORDER.  UPON  TERMINATION OF THE RECEIVERSHIP, RORAN TOOK POSSESSION OF ALL BOOKS AND RECORDS MADE AVAILABLE TO IT BY THE SBA, AND RORAN HAS  EXPENDED, AND CONTINUES TO EXPEND, ITS OWN FUNDS TO MAINTAIN THE VIABILITY OF THE COMPANY. WITH NO ASSETS AND NO SBIC LICENSE  FROM THE SBA, NO INCOME, AND LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF $10,000,000, IT BECAME CLEAR TO THE COMPANY THAT CONTINUING TO OPERATE AS  A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY WAS IMPOSSIBLE. RORAN PROVIDED ASSURANCES THAT IT WOULD FUND REASONABLE EXPENSES OF THE COMPANY  SO LONG AS PROGRESS WAS BEING MADE TO REORGANIZE THE COMPANY AND SEEK A NEW BUSINESS TO UNDERTAKE OR TO MERGE WITH AN EXISTING  BUSINESS. THE NEW BOARD HAS CONTINUED TO WORK TOWARD ACHIEVING THAT GOAL.  THE  COMPANY IS NO LONGER OPERATING AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. THE COMPANY HAS ENGAGED, AND  INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE, QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS AND PERSONNEL IN ORDER TO BRING THE COMPANY CURRENT IN ITS SEC FILINGS  AND AUDITS. RORAN PAID FOR THE COMPANY TO FILE ALL DELINQUENT SEC FILINGS AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES  THAT AS OF JUNE 28, 2017 IT CEASED TO BE A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY SO IT DID NOT FILE AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2017. INSTEAD, THE COMPANY FILED A FORM 10-K FOR THAT PERIOD. PRIOR TO THE FILING OF THAT 10-K,  ON JANUARY 18, 2018 THE COMPANY FILED WITH THE SEC AN APPLICATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 8(F) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940  FOR AN ORDER DECLARING THAT THE COMPANY HAS CEASED TO BE A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY. IN RESPONSE TO THAT FILING, THE SEC  ISSUED TO THE COMPANY COMMENTS IN A LETTER DATED MAY 16, 2018. THE COMPANY RESPONDED TO THOSE COMMENTS WITH THE FILING OF AN AMENDED  APPLICATION ON JUNE 4, 2018. AS OF THE DATE OF THIS QUARTERLY STATEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS SUBMITTED A FOURTH AMENDED APPLICATION  AND EXPECTS RESOLUTION SOON.  FROM  TIME-TO-TIME, NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ARE ISSUED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d), OR OTHER  STANDARD SETTING BODIES, RELATING TO THE TREATMENT AND RECORDING OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS. UNLESS OTHERWISE DISCUSSED  HEREIN, MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THESE RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON  THE FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES  OUR  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  WHICH WE HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. IN PREPARING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF  CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING  THE REPORTING PERIODS.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE ESTIMATES FOR WHICH (A) THE NATURE OF THE ESTIMATE IS MATERIAL DUE TO THE LEVELS OF SUBJECTIVITY AND  JUDGMENT NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS OR THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SUCH MATTERS TO CHANGE AND (B) THE IMPACT  OF THE ESTIMATE ON FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS MATERIAL.  16  THESE  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS BEAR THE RISK OF CHANGE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES ATTACHED  TO THESE ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS, AND CERTAIN ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO MEASURE OR VALUE.  MANAGEMENT  BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE IN RELATION TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT  THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.  MANAGEMENT  REGULARLY EVALUATES THE KEY FACTORS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DEVELOP THE ESTIMATES UTILIZING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, CHANGES  IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS. AFTER SUCH EVALUATIONS, IF DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THOSE  ESTIMATES ARE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.  ACTUAL  RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  WHILE  OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 2 OF OUR QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS  QUARTERLY REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL TO THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION  OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ASSUMPTION  AS A GOING CONCERN  MANAGEMENT  PREPARES THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON THE BASIS THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, WHICH CONTEMPLATES  CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS, REALIZATION OF ASSETS, AND LIQUIDATION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. HOWEVER, GIVEN  OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL POSITION AND LACK OF LIQUIDITY, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  CONVERTIBLE  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  THE  COMPANY BIFURCATES CONVERSION OPTIONS FROM THEIR HOST INSTRUMENTS AND ACCOUNTS FOR THEM AS FREE STANDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS IF CERTAIN CRITERIA ARE MET. THE CRITERIA INCLUDE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH (A) THE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RISKS  OF THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT ARE NOT CLEARLY AND CLOSELY RELATED TO THE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RISKS OF THE HOST  CONTRACT, (B) THE HYBRID INSTRUMENT THAT EMBODIES BOTH THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AND THE HOST CONTRACT IS NOT RE-MEASURED  AT FAIR VALUE UNDER OTHERWISE APPLICABLE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE REPORTED IN EARNINGS  AS THEY OCCUR AND (C) A SEPARATE INSTRUMENT WITH THE SAME TERMS AS THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A DERIVATIVE  INSTRUMENT. AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE IS WHEN THE HOST INSTRUMENT IS DEEMED TO BE CONVENTIONAL, AS THAT TERM IS DESCRIBED UNDER  APPLICABLE GAAP.  WHEN  THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTIONS SHOULD NOT BE BIFURCATED FROM THEIR HOST INSTRUMENTS, DISCOUNTS  ARE RECORDED FOR THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF CONVERSION OPTIONS EMBEDDED IN THE INSTRUMENTS BASED UPON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE  FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK AT THE COMMITMENT DATE OF THE TRANSACTION AND THE EFFECTIVE CONVERSION PRICE EMBEDDED  IN THE INSTRUMENT.  BENEFICIAL  CONVERSION FEATURE  THE  ISSUANCE OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUED BY THE COMPANY (DESCRIBED IN NOTE 3 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) GENERATED A BENEFICIAL  CONVERSION FEATURE (\u201cBCF\u201d), WHICH ARISES WHEN A DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITY IS ISSUED WITH AN EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTION  THAT IS BENEFICIAL TO THE INVESTOR OR IN THE MONEY AT INCEPTION BECAUSE THE CONVERSION OPTION HAS AN EFFECTIVE STRIKE PRICE THAT  IS LESS THAN THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK AT THE COMMITMENT DATE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED THE BCF BY ALLOCATING THE  INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE CONVERSION OPTION, WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE UPON CONVERSION MULTIPLIED BY  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EFFECTIVE CONVERSION PRICE PER SHARE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF COMMON STOCK PER SHARE ON THE COMMITMENT  DATE, RESULTING IN A DISCOUNT ON THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT (RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF ADDITIONAL PAID IN CAPITAL).  17  FAIR  VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  THE  COMPANY FOLLOWS PARAGRAPH 825-10-50-10 OF THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION FOR DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF ITS FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS AND HAS ADOPTED PARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37 OF THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cPARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37\u201d)  TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. PARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37 ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE  IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP), AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE  MEASUREMENTS. TO INCREASE CONSISTENCY AND COMPARABILITY IN FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES, PARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37  ESTABLISHES A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WHICH PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE INTO THREE  (3) BROAD LEVELS. THE THREE (3) LEVELS OF FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY DEFINED BY PARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37 ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.  LEVEL  1: QUOTED MARKET PRICES AVAILABLE IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AS OF THE REPORTING DATE.  LEVEL  2: PRICING INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1, WHICH ARE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  OBSERVABLE AS OF THE REPORTING DATE.  LEVEL  3: PRICING INPUTS THAT ARE GENERALLY UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND NOT CORROBORATED BY MARKET DATA.  FINANCIAL  ASSETS ARE CONSIDERED LEVEL 3 WHEN THEIR FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED USING PRICING MODELS, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGIES OR  SIMILAR TECHNIQUES AND AT LEAST ONE SIGNIFICANT MODEL ASSUMPTION OR INPUT IS UNOBSERVABLE.  THE  FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES  AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. IF THE INPUTS USED TO MEASURE THE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FALL WITHIN  MORE THAN ONE LEVEL DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE CATEGORIZATION IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE  MEASUREMENT OF THE INSTRUMENT.  TRANSACTIONS  INVOLVING RELATED PARTIES CANNOT BE PRESUMED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON AN ARM\u2019S-LENGTH BASIS, AS THE REQUISITE CONDITIONS OF  COMPETITIVE, FREE-MARKET DEALINGS MAY NOT EXIST. REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES, IF MADE, SHALL NOT IMPLY  THAT THE RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS WERE CONSUMMATED ON TERMS EQUIVALENT TO THOSE THAT PREVAIL IN ARM\u2019S-LENGTH TRANSACTIONS  UNLESS SUCH REPRESENTATIONS CAN BE SUBSTANTIATED.  DEFERRED  TAX ASSETS AND INCOME TAXES PROVISION  THE  COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13 OF THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION. PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13  WHICH ADDRESSES THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER TAX BENEFITS CLAIMED OR EXPECTED TO BE CLAIMED ON A TAX RETURN SHOULD BE RECORDED  IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. UNDER PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13, THE COMPANY MAY RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION  ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON  THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION SHOULD BE MEASURED  BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT (50%) LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.  PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13 ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DE-RECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES ON INCOME TAXES, ACCOUNTING  IN INTERIM PERIODS AND REQUIRES INCREASED DISCLOSURES. THE COMPANY HAD NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED  INCOME TAX BENEFITS ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13.  THE  ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REPORTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING  BALANCE SHEETS, AS WELL AS TAX CREDIT CARRY-BACKS AND CARRY-FORWARDS. THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REVIEWS THE RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED  TAX ASSETS RECORDED ON ITS BALANCE SHEETS AND PROVIDES VALUATION ALLOWANCES AS MANAGEMENT DEEMS NECESSARY.  MANAGEMENT  MAKES JUDGMENTS AS TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX LAWS THAT MIGHT BE CHALLENGED UPON AN AUDIT AND CAUSE CHANGES TO PREVIOUS  ESTIMATES OF TAX LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY OPERATES WITHIN MULTIPLE TAXING JURISDICTIONS AND IS SUBJECT TO AUDIT IN  THESE JURISDICTIONS. IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S OPINION, ADEQUATE PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ALL YEARS. IF ACTUAL  TAXABLE INCOME BY TAX JURISDICTION VARIES FROM ESTIMATES, ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES OR REVERSALS OF RESERVES MAY BE NECESSARY.  18  MANAGEMENT  ASSUMES THAT THE REALIZATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RESULTING FROM ITS NET OPERATING LOSS (\u201cNOL\u201d)  CARRY\u2013FORWARDS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES THAT MAY BE OFFSET AGAINST FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME WAS NOT CONSIDERED MORE  LIKELY THAN NOT AND ACCORDINGLY, THE POTENTIAL TAX BENEFITS OF THE NET LOSS CARRY-FORWARDS ARE OFFSET BY A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  MANAGEMENT MADE THIS ASSUMPTION BASED ON (A) THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED RECURRING LOSSES AND PRESENTLY HAS NO REVENUE-PRODUCING  BUSINESS, (B) GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND (C) ITS ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT ITS DAILY OPERATIONS BY WAY  OF A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE OFFERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.  COMPARISON  OF THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018  DURING  THE THREE MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY OPERATIONS AND THEREFORE THERE WERE NO  REVENUES. EXPENSES WERE LIMITED TO MAINTAINING THE COMPANY IN GOOD STANDING AND STAYING CURRENT, RESPECTIVELY, IN ITS FILING OBLIGATIONS  WITH THE SEC.  ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSE  PROFESSIONAL  FEES TOTALED $12,796 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $8,223 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2018. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO MORE ACTIVITY IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AS THE CURRENT COMPARABLE PERIOD REQUIRED MORE EXPENDITURES  FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES TO BRING THE COMPANY CURRENT IN ITS SEC FILINGS.  INTEREST  EXPENSE  INTEREST  EXPENSE TOTALED $22,661 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $21,165 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2018. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BORROWING UNDER THE CONVERTIBLE LOAN FACILITY.  NET  LOSS  WE  REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $35,547 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $29,388 IN THE COMPARABLE  PERIOD OF 2018. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSES AND PROFESSIONAL FEES.  19  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE  HAVE INCURRED RECURRING OPERATING LOSSES AND NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN FISCAL 2018 AND THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AND  WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR OPERATING LOSSES AND NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AT LEAST THROUGH THE NEAR FUTURE. WE HAVE OBTAINED  FUNDING THROUGH A CONVERTIBLE LOAN FACILITY OF UP TO $200,000 IN ORDER TO PARTIALLY MEET OUR MOST CRITICAL CASH REQUIREMENTS,  AND OF THIS AMOUNT, WE HAVE DRAWN APPROXIMATELY $184,338 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. RORAN HAS AGREED TO EXTEND THE LOAN  UNTIL NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED.  AS  A RESULT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED FACTORS, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE  AS A GOING CONCERN. OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, IN ITS REPORT ON OUR FISCAL 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  RAISED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 DO NOT CONTAIN ANY ADJUSTMENTS FOR THIS UNCERTAINTY. IN RESPONSE TO OUR COMPANY\u2019S CASH NEEDS, WE  RAISED FUNDING AS DESCRIBED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ANY ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS RAISED WILL BE USED FOR OUR FUTURE INVESTING AND  OPERATING CASH FLOW NEEDS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS OF FINANCING.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S  PLANS  OUR  PLAN IS TO SEEK, INVESTIGATE, AND CONSUMMATE A MERGER OR OTHER BUSINESS COMBINATION, PURCHASE OF ASSETS OR OTHER STRATEGIC TRANSACTION  (I.E. A MERGER) WITH A CORPORATION, PARTNERSHIP, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OR OTHER OPERATING BUSINESS ENTITY, OR ENTER INTO A  NEW BUSINESS (COLLECTIVELY, A \u201cBUSINESS TARGET\u201d) DESIRING THE PERCEIVED ADVANTAGES OF BECOMING A PUBLICLY REPORTING  AND PUBLICLY HELD CORPORATION. WE HAVE NO OPERATING BUSINESS, AND CONDUCT MINIMAL OPERATIONS NECESSARY TO MEET REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.  OUR ABILITY TO COMMENCE ANY OPERATIONS IS CONTINGENT UPON OBTAINING ADEQUATE FINANCIAL RESOURCES.  WE  ARE NOT CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN ANY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT PROVIDE CASH FLOW. THE COSTS OF INVESTIGATING AND ANALYZING BUSINESS  COMBINATIONS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND BEYOND SUCH TIME WILL BE PAID WITH MONEY BORROWED FROM RORAN.  DURING  THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, WE ANTICIPATE INCURRING COSTS RELATED TO (I) FILING OF EXCHANGE ACT REPORTS; AND, (II) IDENTIFYING AND  CONSUMMATING A TRANSACTION WITH A BUSINESS TARGET. WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THESE COSTS THROUGH USE OF FUNDS BORROWED  FROM RORAN, OR OTHER AMOUNTS TO BE LOANED TO OR INVESTED IN US BY OTHER INVESTORS.  WE  MAY CONSIDER A BUSINESS WHICH HAS RECENTLY COMMENCED OPERATIONS, IS A DEVELOPING COMPANY IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EXPANSION  INTO NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS, IS SEEKING TO DEVELOP A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE, OR IS AN ESTABLISHED BUSINESS WHICH MAY BE EXPERIENCING  FINANCIAL OR OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND IS IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, A BUSINESS COMBINATION MAY INVOLVE  THE ACQUISITION OF, OR MERGER WITH, A COMPANY WHICH DOES NOT NEED SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, BUT WHICH DESIRES TO ESTABLISH  A PUBLIC TRADING MARKET FOR ITS SHARES, WHILE AVOIDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TIME DELAYS, SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE, AND LOSS OF  VOTING CONTROL WHICH MAY OCCUR IN A PUBLIC OFFERING.  ZINDEL  ZELMANOVITCH IS OUR PRESIDENT, SECRETARY AND OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. MR. ZELMANOVITCH IS ONLY REQUIRED TO DEVOTE A SMALL  PORTION OF HIS TIME TO OUR AFFAIRS ON A PART-TIME OR AS-NEEDED BASIS. NO COMPENSATION HAS BEEN PAID TO MR. ZELMANOVITCH FOR HIS  SERVICES AS AN OFFICER AND DIRECTOR. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE HIRING ANY FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES AS LONG AS WE ARE SEEKING AND EVALUATING  BUSINESS TARGETS.  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD ONLY $11,197 CASH ON HAND. SINCE WE HAVE NO REVENUE OR PLANS TO GENERATE ANY REVENUE, WE WILL  BE DEPENDENT UPON LOANS TO FUND EXPENSES INCURRED IN EXCESS OF OUR CASH. ALSO, RELATED PARTY OBLIGATIONS TOTALING $212,541  ARE DUE AND PAYABLE AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THERE  ARE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION,  CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES  THAT ARE MATERIAL TO INVESTORS.  20", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "WATERSIDE CAPITAL CORP", "CIK": 924095, "Date": "2019-11-19T00:00:00", "Ticker": "WSCC", "Name": "Waterside Capital Corp", "Exchange": "OTC", "SIC": null, "Business": "VA", "Incorporated": "VA", "IRS": 541694665.0, "key": "20191119WSCC", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.64357096, "prof1": 0.35642904, "return1&2": 1.0, "return1&2&3": 1.0, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.07305372082489164, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3453, "returnpred": -0.0, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.004662843170964, "cumreturn1b": 1.1612925138306476, "cumreturn1c": 1.0396580525965489, "cumreturndow": 1.0135478544177075, "cumreturnsp500": 1.017322713410973}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3463, "level_0": 3553, "index": 36044, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS RELATE TO OUR PLANS, LIQUIDITY, ABILITY TO COMPLETE FINANCING AND PURCHASE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS INCLUDING ENTERING INTO FUTURE AGREEMENTS WITH COMPANIES, AND PLANS TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND OBTAIN APPROVAL TO MARKET OUR PRODUCT. WE HAVE BASED THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS LARGELY ON OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS AND FINANCIAL TRENDS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BUSINESS STRATEGY AND FINANCIAL NEEDS.  YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES ATTACHED HERETO, AND THE OTHER FINANCIAL DATA APPEARING ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.  US DOLLARS ARE DENOTED HEREIN BY \u201cUSD\u201d, \u201c$\u201d AND \u201cDOLLARS\u201d.  OVERVIEW  UMATRIN HOLDING LIMITED (\u201cUMHL\u201d) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE ON FEBRUARY 2, 2005. UMHL WAS ORIGINALLY INCORPORATED IN ORDER TO LOCATE AND NEGOTIATE WITH A TARGETED BUSINESS ENTITY FOR THE COMBINATION OF THAT TARGET COMPANY WITH THE COMPANY.  ON JANUARY 6, 2016, UMHL ACQUIRED 80% OF THE EQUITY INTERESTS OF UMATRIN WORLDWIDE SDN. BHD. (\u201cUMATRIN\u201d) IN EXCHANGE FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A TOTAL OF 100,000,000 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK TO THE TWO HOLDERS OF UMATRIN, DATO\u2019 SRI EU HIN CHAI AND DATO\u2019 LIEW KOK HONG. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE SHARE EXCHANGE, THE BUSINESS OF UMATRIN BECAME THE BUSINESS OF UMHL. THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATION OFFICE REMAINED IN MALAYSIA AND THE BUSINESS MARKET WILL REMAIN FOCUS IN ASIA.  UMATRIN, FORMERLY KNOWN AS OLC WORLDWIDE SDN. BHD., WAS INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA ON JULY 22, 1993. UMATRIN HAS CURATED NONTOXIC BEAUTY, PERSONAL CARE TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS PRODUCTS. WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH THREE PRIMARY METHODS: DIRECT CONTACT, ONLINE DISTRIBUTION AND/OR BY OUR DEALER PROGRAM. WE APPLY LEADING O2O (ONLINE TO OFFLINE) MARKETING STRATEGY TO BOTH RETAIL AND WHOLESALE TRADE. WE PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES TO ENABLE CONSUMERS, MERCHANTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS TO CONDUCT BUSINESS IN OUR CLOUD BASED TRADING SYSTEM. WE USE ADVANCED NETWORK TECHNOLOGY AND RIGOROUS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO CREATE UNLIMITED BUSINESS BRAND SPACE. WITHOUT ALLOCATING LARGE SUMS OF OPERATING COST, IT CONTINUOUSLY INTRODUCES NEW PRODUCTS, COMBINED WITH O2O INTERNET BUSINESS MODEL AND CAREER OPPORTUNITIES.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2019 AND 2018  SALES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY GENERATED $308,784 IN REVENUES, WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF $175,104, OR 130% COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THIS IS DUE TO INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME FOR AKERO PRODUCT SERIES AND OLD PRODUCTS. INCREASING IN SALES IS ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY HAS INCREASED ITS MARKETING STAFF TO PROMOTE ITS PRODUCTS SINCE APRIL 2019 AND, THE MARKET AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN MALAYSIA HAVE IMPROVED SINCE THE 2018 GENERAL ELECTION.  GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN  THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO GENERATE A GROSS PROFIT MARGIN OF $185,504 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF $55,664 OR 42% COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THIS IS DUE TO INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME FOR NEW AKERO PRODUCT SERIES WHICH HAS A HIGHER PROFIT MARGIN.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS  MAJOR OPERATING COSTS INCLUDE SALARIES AND WAGES, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCREASED FROM $139,107 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 TO $194,161 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THE INCREASE IS DUE TO INCREASE IN OPERATING COST SUCH AS INCREASE IN COMMISSION EXPENSES, PRINTING AND STATIONERIES.  NET INCOME  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD $14,662 IN NET LOSS AS COMPARED TO $15,368 IN NET LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WHICH WAS A DECREASE IN NET LOSS OF $706. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT NEW MARKETING STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE ITS FINANCIAL POSITION.  COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2019 AND 2018  SALES  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY GENERATED $902,750 IN REVENUES, WHICH HAS AN INCREASE OF $623,857, OR 223% COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THIS IS DUE TO INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME FOR AKERO PRODUCT SERIES.  GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN  THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO GENERATE A GROSS PROFIT MARGIN OF $685,079 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH HAS AN INCREASE OF $428,391 OR 166% COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THIS IS DUE TO INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME FOR NEW AKERO PRODUCT SERIES WHICH HAS HIGHER PROFIT MARGIN.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS  MAJOR OPERATING COSTS INCLUDE SALARIES AND WAGES, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCREASED FROM $404,874 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 TO $549,483 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THE INCREASE IS DUE TO INCREASE IN OPERATING COST SUCH AS INCREASE IN COMMISSION EXPENSES, PRINTING AND STATIONERIES.  NET INCOME  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD $117,453 IN NET PROFIT AS COMPARED TO $166,990 IN NET LOSS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WHICH WAS AN INCREASE IN NET PROFIT OF $284,443. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT NEW MARKETING STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE ITS FINANCIAL POSITION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT OF $150,037 AND $36,431 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  OUR COMPANY'S OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN FUNDED THROUGH AN EQUITY FINANCING AND A SERIES OF DEBT TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY WITH SHAREHOLDERS, DIRECTORS, AND OFFICERS OF OUR COMPANY AND AFFILIATED ENTITIES. THESE RELATED PARTY DEBT TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS ADVANCES HAVE OPERATED AS INFORMAL LINES OF CREDIT SINCE THE INCEPTION OF OUR COMPANY, AND RELATED PARTIES HAVE EXTENDED CREDIT AS NEEDED WHICH OUR COMPANY HAS REPAID AT ITS CONVENIENCE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL INCUR OPERATING LOSSES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND WE BELIEVE WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL CASH TO SUPPORT OUR DAILY OPERATIONS WHILE WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND PRODUCE REVENUES. IF OUR RELATED PARTIES ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, WE WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE FINANCING FROM THIRD PARTIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US, ON TERMS WE BELIEVE TO BE FAVORABLE OR AT ALL. THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND COULD FORCE US TO CURTAIL OR DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS ENTIRELY AND/OR FILE FOR PROTECTION UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAWS.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH INFORMATION ABOUT OUR NET CASH FLOW FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018.

THE MOVEMENT IN NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES RESULTED FROM THE MOVEMENT IN INVENTORY, PREPAID TAX, OTHER RECEIVABLES AND DEPOSITS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER PAYABLES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WE USED $2,841 IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES AS COMPARED TO USING $NIL IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE MOVEMENT IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITY RESULTED FROM PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE USED $130,316 IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES AS COMPARED TO GENERATING $169,760 IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES RESULTED FROM NET REPAYMENT TO RELATED PARTY OF $80,131 AND NET REPAYMENT TO TERM LOAN OF $50,184.  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES RESULTED FROM NET PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM RELATED PARTY OF $184,372 AND NET REPAYMENT TO TERM LOAN OF $14,612.  LOAN COMMITMENT  ON DECEMBER 23, 2014, MYR 2,300,000 (APPROXIMATELY $657,507) TERM LOAN WAS GRANTED TO UMATRIN FOR THE PURCHASE OF FOUR STORY SHOP OFFICES LOCATED AT NO.32, 32-1, 32-2, 32-3, JALAN RADIN BAGUS 3, BANDAR BARU SERI PETALING, 57000, KUALA LUMPUR WITH A REPAYMENT PERIOD OF 240 MONTHS. THIS TERM LOAN WAS SECURED BY (I) TITLE DEED FOR THE SAID PROPERTY, AND (II) WAY OF GUARANTEE BY DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY. THIS TERM LOAN IS SUBJECT TO AN INTEREST CHARGES AT 2.10% PER ANNUM BELOW THE BANK'S BASE LENDING RATE (\"BLR\") WITH DAILY RESTS.

INTEREST EXPENSES WERE $18,143 AND $18,804 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  WE HAVE NO KNOWN DEMANDS OR COMMITMENTS AND WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY EVENTS OR UNCERTAINTIES AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 THAT WILL RESULT IN OR THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY INCREASE OR DECREASE OUR CURRENT LIQUIDITY.  WE HAD NO MATERIAL COMMITMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018 EXCEPT MENTIONED ABOVE.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GOING CONCERN  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS. AS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAD ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $3,339,354 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WHICH INCLUDE A PROFIT OF $117,453 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. WE EXPECT TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR EXISTING CASH, OUR OPERATIONS AND ANY FUTURE FINANCING. HOWEVER, THERE EXISTS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN BECAUSE WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH CAPITAL, THROUGH EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING, OR ANY COMBINATION THEREOF, OR ON SATISFACTORY TERMS OR AT ALL. ADDITIONALLY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT ANY SUCH FINANCING, IF OBTAINED, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR CAPITAL NEEDS. IF ADEQUATE CAPITAL CANNOT BE OBTAINED ON A TIMELY BASIS AND ON SATISFACTORY TERMS, OUR OPERATIONS WOULD BE MATERIALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  OVERVIEW  BRADY CORPORATION IS A GLOBAL MANUFACTURER AND SUPPLIER OF IDENTIFICATION SOLUTIONS AND WORKPLACE SAFETY PRODUCTS THAT IDENTIFY AND PROTECT PREMISES, PRODUCTS AND PEOPLE. THE IDS SEGMENT IS PRIMARILY INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE AND INNOVATIVE IDENTIFICATION AND HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS. THE WPS SEGMENT PROVIDES WORKPLACE SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE PRODUCTS, APPROXIMATELY HALF OF WHICH ARE INTERNALLY MANUFACTURED AND HALF OF WHICH ARE EXTERNALLY SOURCED.  THE LONG-TERM SALES GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR SEGMENTS WILL DEPEND NOT ONLY ON IMPROVED DEMAND IN END MARKETS AND  THE OVERALL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, BUT ALSO ON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, FOCUS ON THE CUSTOMER, DEVELOP AND MARKET INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS, AND TO ADVANCE OUR DIGITAL CAPABILITIES. IN OUR IDENTIFICATION SOLUTIONS (\"ID SOLUTIONS\" OR \"IDS\") BUSINESS, OUR STRATEGY FOR GROWTH INCLUDES AN INCREASED FOCUS ON CERTAIN INDUSTRIES AND PRODUCTS, A FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE CUSTOMER BUYING EXPERIENCE, AND INCREASING INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\"R&D\") TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS. IN OUR WORKPLACE SAFETY (\"WPS\") BUSINESS, OUR STRATEGY FOR GROWTH INCLUDES A FOCUS ON WORKPLACE SAFETY CRITICAL INDUSTRIES, INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS, COMPLIANCE EXPERTISE, CUSTOMIZATION EXPERTISE, AND IMPROVING OUR DIGITAL CAPABILITIES.  THE FOLLOWING ARE KEY INITIATIVES SUPPORTING THE STRATEGY IN FISCAL 2020.  \u2022  ENHANCING OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND IMPROVING THE TIME TO LAUNCH HIGH-VALUE, INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS IN ALIGNMENT WITH OUR TARGET MARKETS.  \u2022  PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.  \u2022  DRIVING OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND EXECUTING SUSTAINABLE EFFICIENCY GAINS WITHIN OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND WITHIN OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES.  \u2022  EXPANDING AND ENHANCING OUR SALES CAPABILITIES THROUGH AN IMPROVED DIGITAL PRESENCE AND INCREASED SALES RESOURCES.  \u2022  GROWING THROUGH FOCUSED ACTIONS IN SELECTED VERTICAL MARKETS AND STRATEGIC ACCOUNTS.  \u2022  ENHANCING OUR EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS TO CREATE AN ENGAGED WORKFORCE AND TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY TALENT.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  A COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  IS AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019%  SALES  2018%  SALES  NET SALES  $286,947  $293,196  GROSS MARGIN  141,405  49.3%  146,539  50.0%  OPERATING EXPENSES.

THE COMPANY'S ORGANIC SALES DISCLOSURES EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY THAT CAN OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF ORGANIC SALES IS MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS AS IT PROVIDES THEM WITH USEFUL INFORMATION TO AID IN IDENTIFYING UNDERLYING SALES TRENDS IN OUR BUSINESSES AND FACILITATING COMPARISONS OF OUR SALES PERFORMANCE WITH PRIOR PERIODS.  NET SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , DECREASED  2.1%  TO  $286.9 MILLION  , COMPARED TO  $293.2 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE CONSISTED OF AN ORGANIC SALES DECLINE OF  0.4%  AND A DECREASE FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION OF  1.7%  . ORGANIC SALES DECLINED  0.2%  IN THE IDS SEGMENT AND DECLINED  0.8%  IN THE WPS SEGMENT DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE IDS SEGMENT REALIZED SALES GROWTH IN THE  SAFETY AND FACILITY ID PRODUCT LINE, AND REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT TO SLIGHTLY DOWN IN THE PRODUCT ID, WIRE ID AND HEALTHCARE ID PRODUCT LINES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THE WPS SEGMENT REALIZED LOW-SINGLE DIGIT SALES GROWTH IN DIGITAL SALES, WHILE SALES THROUGH THE CATALOG CHANNEL DECLINED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GROSS MARGIN FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , DECREASED  3.5%  TO  $141.4  MILLION, COMPARED TO  $146.5  MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, GROSS MARGIN DECREASED TO  49.3%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , FROM  50.0%  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INPUT COSTS SUCH AS PERSONNEL, MATERIAL, TARIFF, AND FREIGHT COSTS, ALONG WITH REDUCED SALES VOLUME, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND DRIVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, INCLUDING INCREASED AUTOMATION IN OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\u201cR&D\u201d) EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , DECREASED  3.2%  TO  $11.0 MILLION  , COMPARED TO  $11.3 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, R&D EXPENSES REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN R&D SPENDING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF EXPENDITURES RELATED TO ONGOING NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. THE COMPANY REMAINS COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TO INCREASE SALES WITHIN OUR IDS AND WPS BUSINESSES. INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRINTERS AND MATERIALS CONTINUE TO BE THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF R&D EXPENDITURES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (\"SG&A\") INCLUDE SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE IDS AND WPS SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDING FINANCE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, HUMAN RESOURCES, AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. SG&A DECREASED  5.3%  TO  $89.5 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $94.6 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, SG&A WAS  31.2%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  32.3%  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF THE DECREASE IN SG&A WAS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, AND THE REMAINDER WAS DUE TO ONGOING EFFICIENCY GAINS AND CONTINUED EFFORTS TO REDUCE SG&A COSTS.  OPERATING INCOME WAS  $40.9 MILLION  AND  $40.6 MILLION  FOR  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SEGMENT PROFIT IN THE IDS SEGMENT AND REDUCED SG&A IN BOTH SEGMENTS.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES HELD IN DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS AND AN INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  INTEREST EXPENSE REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT AT  $0.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , FROM  $0.7 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR AS THERE WAS MINIMAL CHANGE IN THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL BALANCE UNDER ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT AGREEMENTS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE COMPANY\u2019S INCOME TAX RATE WAS  9.8%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  23.2%  IN THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

ORGANIC SALES GREW IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS IN THE UNITED STATES AND DECLINED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS IN THE REST OF THE AMERICAS.  ORGANIC SALES IN EUROPE DECREASED IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN THE SAFETY AND FACILITY ID PRODUCT LINE. THE ORGANIC SALES DECLINE WAS DUE TO BUSINESSES IN EMERGING GEOGRAPHIES DUE TO A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT CERTAIN BUSINESSES BASED IN WESTERN EUROPE.  ORGANIC SALES IN ASIA DECREASED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN THE SAFETY AND FACILITY ID AND PRODUCT ID PRODUCT LINES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN THE WIRE ID PRODUCT LINE. ORGANIC SALES DECLINED IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGITS WITHIN CHINA PARTIALLY DUE TO THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACT OF TARIFFS, AND REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT IN THE REST OF ASIA.  SEGMENT PROFIT INCREASED  2.1%  TO  $42.4 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $41.6 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

SALES THROUGHOUT THE REST OF EUROPE REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT. SALES THROUGH THE DIGITAL CHANNEL INCREASED IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGITS WHILE SALES THROUGH THE CATALOG CHANNEL DECREASED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS.  ORGANIC SALES IN THE AMERICAS DECLINED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A LOW-SINGLE DIGIT DECLINE IN CATALOG SALES AND A SLIGHT DECLINE IN SALES THROUGH THE DIGITAL CHANNEL. THIS BUSINESS CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON SALES FROM A DIGITAL PLATFORM THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN FISCAL 2018 AND TRANSITIONED TO A NEW DIGITAL PLATFORM IN FISCAL 2019 TO ADDRESS THIS DECLINE. THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE NEW DIGITAL PLATFORM HAS IMPROVED COMPARED TO THE FORMER DIGITAL PLATFORM; HOWEVER, SALES HAVE NOT YET RETURNED TO THE LEVEL EXPERIENCED PRIOR TO THE INITIAL PLATFORM CHANGE IN FISCAL 2018.  ORGANIC SALES IN AUSTRALIA DECLINED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS IN BOTH THE DIGITAL AND TRADITIONAL CATALOG CHANNEL FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PAYMENTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $7.2 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $5.7 MILLION  USED IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

ON MAY 13, 2010, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF \u20ac75.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES TO ACCREDITED INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS.

ON AUGUST 1, 2019, THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO AN UNSECURED $200 MILLION MULTI-CURRENCY REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT WITH A GROUP OF FIVE BANKS THAT REPLACED AND TERMINATED THE COMPANY\u2019S PREVIOUS LOAN AGREEMENT THAT HAD BEEN ENTERED INTO ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2015. UNDER THE NEW REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS THE OPTION TO SELECT EITHER A BASE INTEREST RATE (BASED UPON THE HIGHER OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE PLUS ONE-HALF OF 1% OR THE PRIME RATE OF THE BANK OF MONTREAL PLUS A MARGIN BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED NET LEVERAGE RATIO), OR THE EUROCURRENCY INTEREST RATE (AT THE LIBOR RATE PLUS A MARGIN BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED NET LEVERAGE RATIO) PLUS 1%. AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, THE AVAILABLE AMOUNT UNDER THE REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT MAY BE INCREASED FROM $200 MILLION TO $400 MILLION.

ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT, BASED ON INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO US AND OUR MANAGEMENT, THE EXPECTATIONS REFLECTED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE REASONABLE, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS, LEVELS OF ACTIVITY, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS. YOU SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING PROVIDER OF ONLINE AUCTIONS AND VEHICLE REMARKETING SERVICES WITH OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cU.S.\u201d), CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM (\u201cU.K.\u201d), BRAZIL, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, GERMANY, FINLAND, THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (\u201cU.A.E.\u201d), OMAN, BAHRAIN, AND SPAIN.  OUR GOALS ARE TO GENERATE SUSTAINABLE PROFITS FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS, WHILE ALSO PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS FOR THE WORLD AROUND US. WITH RESPECT TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, WE BELIEVE OUR BUSINESS IS A CRITICAL ENABLER FOR THE GLOBAL RE-USE AND RECYCLING OF VEHICLES, PARTS AND RAW MATERIALS. MANY OF THE CARS WE PROCESS AND REMARKET ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RESTORED TO DRIVABLE CONDITION, REDUCING THE NEW VEHICLE MANUFACTURING BURDEN THE WORLD WOULD OTHERWISE FACE. MANY OF OUR CARS ARE PURCHASED BY DISMANTLERS, WHO RECYCLE AND REFURBISH PARTS FOR VEHICLE REPAIRS, AGAIN REDUCING NEW AND AFTERMARKET PARTS MANUFACTURING. AND FINALLY, SOME OF OUR VEHICLES ARE RETURNED TO THEIR RAW MATERIAL INPUTS THROUGH SCRAPPING, REDUCING THE NEED FOR FURTHER DE NOVO RESOURCE EXTRACTION. IN EACH CASE, OUR BUSINESS HAS REDUCED THE CARBON AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT OF THE GLOBAL TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY. BEYOND OUR ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, WE ALSO SUPPORT THE WORLD\u2019S COMMUNITIES IN TWO IMPORTANT WAYS. FIRST, WE BELIEVE THAT WE CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND WELL-BEING BY ENABLING MORE AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO MOBILITY AROUND THE WORLD. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY OF THE AUTOMOBILES SOLD THROUGH OUR AUCTION PLATFORM ARE PURCHASED FOR USE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHERE AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION IS A CRITICAL ENABLER OF EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, AND WELL-BEING MORE GENERALLY. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL ROLE WE PLAY IN RESPONDING TO CATASTROPHIC WEATHER EVENTS, WE BELIEVE WE CONTRIBUTE TO DISASTER RECOVERY AND RESILIENCE IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MOBILIZED OUR PEOPLE, ENTERED INTO EMERGENCY LEASES, AND ENGAGED WITH A MULTITUDE OF SERVICE PROVIDERS TO TIMELY RETRIEVE, STORE, AND REMARKET TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FLOOD-DAMAGED VEHICLES IN THE HOUSTON, TEXAS METROPOLITAN AREA IN THE WAKE OF HURRICANE HARVEY IN THE SUMMER OF 2017.  WE PROVIDE VEHICLE SELLERS WITH A FULL RANGE OF SERVICES TO PROCESS AND SELL VEHICLES PRIMARILY OVER THE INTERNET THROUGH OUR VIRTUAL BIDDING THIRD GENERATION INTERNET AUCTION-STYLE SALES TECHNOLOGY, WHICH WE REFER TO AS VB3. VEHICLE SELLERS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF INSURANCE COMPANIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDE BANKS, FINANCE COMPANIES, CHARITIES, FLEET OPERATORS, DEALERS AND VEHICLES SOURCED DIRECTLY FROM INDIVIDUAL OWNERS. WE SELL THE VEHICLES PRINCIPALLY TO LICENSED VEHICLE DISMANTLERS, REBUILDERS, REPAIR LICENSEES, USED VEHICLE DEALERS AND EXPORTERS AND, AT CERTAIN LOCATIONS, TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE MAJORITY OF THE VEHICLES SOLD ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE EITHER DAMAGED VEHICLES DEEMED A TOTAL LOSS; NOT ECONOMICALLY REPAIRABLE BY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES; OR ARE RECOVERED STOLEN VEHICLES FOR WHICH AN INSURANCE SETTLEMENT WITH THE VEHICLE OWNER HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE. WE OFFER VEHICLE SELLERS A FULL RANGE OF SERVICES THAT HELP EXPEDITE EACH STAGE OF THE VEHICLE SALES PROCESS, MINIMIZE ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROCESSING COSTS, AND MAXIMIZE THE ULTIMATE SALES PRICE THROUGH THE ONLINE AUCTION PROCESS.  IN THE U.S., CANADA, BRAZIL, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, FINLAND, THE U.A.E., OMAN, AND BAHRAIN, WE SELL VEHICLES PRIMARILY AS AN AGENT AND DERIVE REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM AUCTION AND AUCTION RELATED SALES TRANSACTION FEES CHARGED FOR VEHICLE REMARKETING SERVICES AS WELL AS FEES FOR SERVICES SUBSEQUENT TO THE AUCTION, SUCH AS DELIVERY AND STORAGE. IN THE U.K., GERMANY, AND SPAIN, WE OPERATE BOTH AS AN AGENT AND ON A PRINCIPAL BASIS, IN SOME CASES PURCHASING SALVAGE VEHICLES OUTRIGHT AND RESELLING THE VEHICLES FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT. IN GERMANY AND SPAIN, WE ALSO DERIVE REVENUE FROM LISTING VEHICLES ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE EXPERTS TO DETERMINE THE VEHICLE\u2019S RESIDUAL VALUE AND/OR TO FACILITATE A SALE FOR THE INSURED.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE MONITOR AND ANALYZE A NUMBER OF KEY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS AND EVALUATE OUR FINANCIAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE. SUCH INDICATORS INCLUDE.  SERVICE AND VEHICLE SALES REVENUE.  OUR SERVICE REVENUE CONSISTS OF AUCTION AND AUCTION RELATED SALES TRANSACTION FEES CHARGED FOR VEHICLE REMARKETING SERVICES. THESE AUCTION AND AUCTION RELATED SERVICES MAY INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF VEHICLE PURCHASING FEES, VEHICLE LISTING FEES, AND VEHICLE SELLING FEES THAT CAN BE BASED ON A PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF THE VEHICLE SALES PRICE, TIERED VEHICLE SALES PRICE DRIVEN FEES, OR AT A FIXED FEE BASED ON THE SALE OF EACH VEHICLE REGARDLESS OF THE SELLING PRICE OF THE VEHICLE; TRANSPORTATION FEES FOR THE COST OF TRANSPORTING THE VEHICLE TO OR FROM OUR FACILITY; TITLE PROCESSING AND PREPARATION FEES; VEHICLE STORAGE FEES; BIDDING FEES; AND VEHICLE LOADING FEES. THESE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED AS NET REVENUE (NOT GROSS VEHICLE SELLING PRICE) AT THE TIME OF AUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF SUCH FEES CHARGED. PURCHASED VEHICLE REVENUE INCLUDES THE GROSS SALES PRICE OF THE VEHICLES WHICH WE HAVE PURCHASED OR ARE OTHERWISE CONSIDERED TO OWN. WE HAVE CERTAIN CONTRACTS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, PRIMARILY IN THE U.K., IN WHICH WE ACT AS A PRINCIPAL, PURCHASING VEHICLES AND RESELLING THEM FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT. WE ALSO PURCHASE VEHICLES IN THE OPEN MARKET, PRIMARILY FROM INDIVIDUALS, AND RESELL THEM FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT.  OUR REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY AND THE AVERAGE VEHICLE AUCTION SELLING PRICE, AS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SERVICE REVENUE IS ASSOCIATED IN SOME MANNER WITH THE ULTIMATE SELLING PRICE OF THE VEHICLE. VEHICLE AUCTION SELLING PRICES ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY: (I) DOMESTIC AND MARKET DEMAND FOR REBUILDABLE, DRIVABLE VEHICLES; (II) USED CAR PRICING, WHICH WE ALSO BELIEVE HAS AN IMPACT ON TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY; (III) END MARKET DEMAND FOR RECYCLED AND REFURBISHED PARTS AS REFLECTED IN DEMAND FROM DISMANTLERS; (IV) THE MIX OF CARS SOLD; (V) CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE HAS AN IMPACT ON AUCTION PARTICIPATION BY INTERNATIONAL BUYERS; AND (VI) CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, PARTICULARLY THE PER TON PRICE FOR CRUSHED CAR BODIES, AS WE BELIEVE THIS HAS AN IMPACT ON THE ULTIMATE SELLING PRICE OF VEHICLES SOLD FOR SCRAP AND VEHICLES SOLD FOR DISMANTLING. WE CANNOT SPECIFICALLY QUANTIFY THE FINANCIAL IMPACT THAT COMMODITY PRICING, USED CAR PRICING, AND PRODUCT SALES MIX HAS ON THE SELLING PRICE OF VEHICLES, OUR SERVICE REVENUES OR FINANCIAL RESULTS. TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY IS THE PERCENTAGE OF CARS INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES SALVAGE RATHER THAN REPAIR AND IS DRIVEN BY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REPAIR COSTS, USED CAR VALUES, AND AUCTION RETURNS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN OVERALL GROWTH IN THE SALVAGE MARKET DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY MAY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY THE DECLINE IN USED CAR VALUES RELATIVE TO REPAIR COSTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE GENERALLY TRENDING UPWARD. CONVERSELY, INCREASES IN USED CAR PRICES, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING THE MOST RECENT RECESSION, MAY DECREASE TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROWTH RATE. USED CAR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING USED CAR SUPPLY, WHICH IS TIED DIRECTLY TO NEW CAR SALES, AND THE AVERAGE AGE OF CARS ON THE ROAD. THE AVERAGE AGE OF CARS ON THE ROAD CONTINUED TO INCREASE, GROWING FROM 9.6 YEARS IN 2002 TO 11.8 YEARS IN 2019. THE FACTORS THAT CAN INFLUENCE REPAIR COSTS, USED CAR PRICING, AND AUCTION RETURNS ARE MANY AND VARIED AND WE CANNOT PREDICT THEIR MOVEMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE TRENDS IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY.  OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES.  YARD OPERATIONS EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF OPERATING PERSONNEL (WHICH INCLUDES YARD MANAGEMENT, CLERICAL AND YARD EMPLOYEES), RENT, CONTRACT VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION, INSURANCE, FUEL, EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR, AND COSTS OF VEHICLES SOLD UNDER THE PURCHASE CONTRACTS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING, SALES PERSONNEL, HUMAN RESOURCES, PROFESSIONAL FEES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND MARKETING EXPENSES.  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.  OTHER INCOME PRIMARILY INCLUDES INCOME FROM THE RENTAL OF CERTAIN REAL PROPERTY, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE GAINS AND LOSSES, AND GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, WHICH WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THESE ACTIVITIES EACH PERIOD. OTHER EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON LONG-TERM DEBT. SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  3 \u2013 LONG-TERM DEBT.  LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF WORKING CAPITAL IS CASH OPERATING RESULTS AND DEBT FINANCING. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OUR LIQUIDITY IS OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY. THE PRIMARY FACTORS AFFECTING CASH OPERATING RESULTS ARE: (I) SEASONALITY; (II) MARKET WINS AND LOSSES; (III) SUPPLIER MIX; (IV) ACCIDENT FREQUENCY; (V) TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY; (VI) INCREASED VOLUME FROM OUR EXISTING SUPPLIERS; (VII) COMMODITY PRICING; (VIII) USED CAR PRICING; (IX) FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES; (X) PRODUCT MIX; (XI) CONTRACT MIX TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE; AND (XII) OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THESE FACTORS ARE FURTHER DISCUSSED IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND RISK FACTORS SECTIONS OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  POTENTIAL INTERNAL SOURCES OF ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL ARE THE SALE OF ASSETS OR THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES THROUGH OPTION EXERCISES AND SHARES ISSUED UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. A POTENTIAL EXTERNAL SOURCE OF ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL IS THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL DEBT WITH NEW LENDERS AND EQUITY. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT PREDICT IF THESE SOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE OR ON COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TERMS.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ACQUISITIONS AND NEW OPERATIONS  AS PART OF OUR OVERALL EXPANSION STRATEGY OF OFFERING INTEGRATED SERVICES TO VEHICLE SELLERS, WE ANTICIPATE ACQUIRING AND DEVELOPING FACILITIES IN NEW REGIONS, AS WELL AS THE REGIONS CURRENTLY SERVED BY OUR FACILITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ACQUISITIONS AND OPENINGS WILL STRENGTHEN OUR COVERAGE, AS WE HAVE FACILITIES LOCATED IN THE U.S., CANADA, THE U.K., BRAZIL, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, GERMANY, FINLAND, THE U.A.E., OMAN, BAHRAIN, AND SPAIN WITH THE INTENTION OF PROVIDING NATIONAL COVERAGE FOR OUR SELLERS.

IN ADDITION TO GROWTH THROUGH BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, WE SEEK TO INCREASE REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) ACQUIRING AND DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL VEHICLE STORAGE FACILITIES IN KEY MARKETS; (II) PURSUING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL VEHICLE SELLER AGREEMENTS; (III) INCREASING OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS; AND (IV) EXPANDING THE APPLICATION OF VB3 INTO NEW MARKETS. IN ADDITION, WE IMPLEMENT OUR PRICING STRUCTURE AND AUCTION PROCEDURES, AND ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE COST EFFICIENCIES AT EACH OF OUR ACQUIRED FACILITIES BY IMPLEMENTING OUR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES, INTEGRATING OUR MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND REDEPLOYING PERSONNEL, WHEN NECESSARY.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS CERTAIN DATA FROM OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL SERVICE REVENUES AND VEHICLE SALES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  .

THE  INCREASE  IN SERVICE REVENUES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  OF  $93.1 MILLION  , OR  23.6%  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR RESULTED FROM (I)  AN INCREASE  IN THE U.S. OF  $87.2 MILLION  AND (II)  AN INCREASE  IN INTERNATIONAL OF  $5.8 MILLION  . THE GROWTH IN THE U.S. WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY (I) INCREASED VOLUME AND (II) AN INCREASE IN REVENUE PER CAR DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE AUCTION SELLING PRICES, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF VEHICLES SOLD. THE INCREASE IN VOLUME IN THE U.S. WAS DERIVED FROM (I) GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF UNITS SOLD FROM NEW AND EXPANDED CONTRACTS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, AND (II) GROWTH FROM EXISTING SUPPLIERS, DRIVEN BY WHAT WE BELIEVE WAS AN INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY. EXCLUDING THE DETRIMENTAL IMPACT OF $2.3 MILLION DUE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY FROM THE CHANGE IN THE BRITISH POUND AND BRAZILIAN REAL TO U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATES, THE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL OF $8.1 MILLION WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED VOLUME AND HIGHER AVERAGE AUCTION SELLING PRICES.

THE  INCREASE  IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM DEPRECIATING CERTAIN CORPORATE AND TECHNOLOGY ASSETS IN THE U.S.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES TOTAL OTHER EXPENSE AND INCOME TAXES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  .

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO PAYMENTS FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED TAX WITHHOLDINGS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES NOT FULLY OFFSET BY CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED PRIMARILY FROM CERTAIN INCOME TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES AND TIMING OF CASH PAYMENTS. CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSISTED OF BANK DEPOSITS, DOMESTIC CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, AND FUNDS INVESTED IN MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS, WHICH BEAR INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES.  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR GROWTH THROUGH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF COMMON STOCK, EQUITY ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT FINANCING. OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS IS FROM THE COLLECTION OF SERVICE FEES AND REIMBURSABLE ADVANCES FROM THE PROCEEDS OF VEHICLE SALES. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO FINANCE OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND TO DEVELOP AND GROW OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION TO OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE ARE CONSIDERING A VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL USES FOR OUR REMAINING CASH BALANCES AND OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. THESE ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL USES INCLUDE ADDITIONAL STOCK REPURCHASES, REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT, THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AND ACQUISITIONS. FOR FURTHER DETAIL, SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  3 \u2013 LONG-TERM DEBT  AND  NOTE  9 \u2013 STOCK REPURCHASES  AND UNDER THE SUBHEADINGS \u201c  CREDIT AGREEMENT  \u201d AND \u201c  NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT  \u201d BELOW.  OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL AS INCLEMENT WEATHER DURING THE WINTER MONTHS INCREASES THE FREQUENCY OF ACCIDENTS AND CONSEQUENTLY, THE NUMBER OF CARS INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS WHICH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SALVAGE RATHER THAN REPAIR. DURING THE WINTER MONTHS, MOST OF OUR FACILITIES PROCESS 10% TO 30% MORE VEHICLES THAN AT OTHER TIMES OF THE YEAR. THIS INCREASED VOLUME REQUIRES THE INCREASED USE OF OUR CASH TO PAY OUT ADVANCES AND HANDLING COSTS OF THE ADDITIONAL BUSINESS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENTLY AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR OPERATING AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE EXPECT TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS AND EXPAND SOME OF OUR CURRENT FACILITIES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CASH THROUGH DRAWDOWNS ON OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY OR ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY TO FUND THIS EXPANSION. ALTHOUGH THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF GROWTH THROUGH EXPANSION AND ACQUISITIONS ARE NOT PREDICTABLE, THE OPENING OF NEW GREENFIELD YARDS IS CONTINGENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE PROPERTY THAT (I) IS IN AN AREA IN WHICH WE HAVE A NEED FOR MORE CAPACITY; (II) HAS ADEQUATE SIZE GIVEN THE CAPACITY NEEDS; (III) HAS THE APPROPRIATE SHAPE AND TOPOGRAPHY FOR OUR OPERATIONS; (IV) IS REASONABLY CLOSE TO A MAJOR ROAD OR HIGHWAY; AND (V) MOST IMPORTANTLY, HAS THE APPROPRIATE ZONING FOR OUR BUSINESS. COSTS TO DEVELOP A NEW YARD CAN RANGE FROM $3.0 TO $50.0 MILLION, DEPENDING ON SIZE, LOCATION AND DEVELOPMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS.  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  ,  $93.3 MILLION  OF THE  $181.1 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IF THESE FUNDS ARE NEEDED FOR OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., THE REPATRIATION OF THESE FUNDS COULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX FOLLOWING THE U.S. TAX REFORM. HOWEVER, OUR INTENT IS TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST THESE FUNDS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND OUR CURRENT PLANS DO NOT REQUIRE REPATRIATION TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONS.  NET CASH  PROVIDED BY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE TO IMPROVED CASH OPERATING RESULTS FROM AN INCREASE IN SERVICE REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN YARD OPERATIONS AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A AN INCREASE OF INCOME TAXES RECEIVABLE OF $44.0 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN FUNDS USED TO PAY ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $37.2 MILLION.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET CASH  USED IN  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO LEASE BUYOUTS OF CERTAIN FACILITIES, ACQUIRING LAND, OPENING AND IMPROVING FACILITIES, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR NEW SOFTWARE FOR INTERNAL USE AND MAJOR SOFTWARE ENHANCEMENTS, AND ACQUIRING YARD EQUIPMENT. WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP, EXPAND AND INVEST IN NEW AND EXISTING FACILITIES AND STANDARDIZE THE APPEARANCE OF EXISTING LOCATIONS.  NET CASH  USED IN  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO PAYMENTS FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK BASED TAX WITHHOLDINGS, AS DISCUSSED IN FURTHER DETAIL UNDER THE SUBHEADING \"  STOCK REPURCHASES  \" PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS.

THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSES OF THESE FINANCING TRANSACTIONS WERE TO INCREASE THE SIZE AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FINANCING. THE PROCEEDS ARE BEING USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, POTENTIAL SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS, OR OTHER INVESTMENTS RELATING TO OUR EXPANSION STRATEGIES IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , TOTAL SALES PER SQUARE FOOT WERE  $449.17  AND OUR INVENTORY TURNOVER RATIO WAS  5.0  TIMES.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 5.2 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR  $1.3 BILLION  THROUGH AN ASR AGREEMENT AND OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS.

SALES.  WE ASSESS OUR SALES PERFORMANCE BY EVALUATING BOTH NET SALES AND COMPARABLE SALES.  NET SALES  . NET SALES FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  3.5%  TO  $27.2 BILLION  FROM  $26.3 BILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE IN NET SALES IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET AND COMPARABLE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS. ONLINE SALES, WHICH CONSIST OF SALES GENERATED ONLINE THROUGH OUR WEBSITES FOR PRODUCTS PICKED UP IN OUR STORES OR DELIVERED TO CUSTOMER LOCATIONS, REPRESENTED  8.9%  OF NET SALES AND GREW  21.9%  DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SALES GROWTH BY  $41 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  COMPARABLE SALES  . COMPARABLE SALES IS A MEASURE THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR EXISTING LOCATIONS AND WEBSITES BY MEASURING THE CHANGE IN NET SALES FOR A PERIOD OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-PERIOD OF EQUIVALENT LENGTH. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDES SALES AT ALL LOCATIONS, PHYSICAL AND ONLINE, OPEN GREATER THAN 52 WEEKS (INCLUDING REMODELS AND RELOCATIONS) AND EXCLUDING CLOSED STORES. RETAIL STORES BECOME COMPARABLE ON THE MONDAY FOLLOWING THEIR 365  TH  DAY OF OPERATION. ACQUISITIONS, DIGITAL OR OTHERWISE, ARE INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE SALES AFTER WE OWN THE ACQUIRED ASSETS FOR MORE THAN 52 WEEKS. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDES NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERING SALES THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED FOR MORE THAN 52 WEEKS. COMPARABLE SALES EXCLUDES PRIOR-YEAR SALES OF PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS THAT WE HAVE EXITED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. FISCAL 2019 INCLUDES 52 WEEKS AND FISCAL 2018 INCLUDED 53  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WEEKS. FOR OUR CALCULATION OF COMPARABLE SALES IN FISCAL 2019, WE WILL COMPARE WEEKS 1 THROUGH 52 IN FISCAL 2019 AGAINST WEEKS 2 THROUGH 53 IN FISCAL 2018. COMPARABLE SALES IS INTENDED ONLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET SALES PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES  INCREASED  3.6%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , CONSISTING OF A  1.8%  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET AND A  1.8%  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS. THE  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE SALES REFLECTED A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TRAFFIC GROWTH ACROSS A NUMBER OF OUR CORE CATEGORIES AND THE EXECUTION OF OUR STRATEGIC EFFORTS TO DRIVE AN ENHANCED INTERCONNECTED EXPERIENCE IN BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL WORLDS.  ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS POSTED POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  EXCEPT FOR  ELECTRICAL/LIGHTING AND LUMBER  . COMPARABLE SALES FOR OUR  APPLIANCES, INDOOR GARDEN, DE\u0301COR/STORAGE, HARDWARE, TOOLS, OUTDOOR GARDEN, PAINT, AND PLUMBING  MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS WERE ABOVE THE COMPANY AVERAGE IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . COMPARABLE SALES FOR ELECTRICAL/LIGHTING WERE SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE DUE TO THE LENGTHENING REPLACEMENT CYCLE OF LIGHT BULBS AND COPPER PRICE DEFLATION. COMPARABLE SALES FOR LUMBER WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY COMMODITY PRICE DEFLATION.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COMPARABLE SALES GROWTH AND TOTAL SALES GROWTH IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS DUE TO THE SHIFT IN OUR FISCAL CALENDAR AS A RESULT OF THE 53  RD  WEEK IN FISCAL 2018.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  INCREASED  2.6%  TO  $9.4 BILLION  FROM  $9.2 BILLION  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, OR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN, WAS  34.5%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  34.8%  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . THE  DECREASE  IN GROSS PROFIT MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SHRINK AND A CHANGE IN PRODUCT MIX.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE COMPOSED OF SG&A AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE  . SG&A FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  2.8%  TO  $4.9 BILLION  FROM  $4.8 BILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, SG&A WAS  18.2%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO  18.3%  FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, DRIVEN BY EXPENSE LEVERAGE RESULTING FROM POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES AND CONTINUED EXPENSE CONTROL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXPENSES RELATED TO STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  INCREASED  $25 MILLION  TO  $498 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  FROM  $473 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS  1.8%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND FISCAL  2018  , REFLECTING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS, LEVERAGE RESULTING FROM POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES, AND TIMING OF ASSET ADDITIONS.  INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.  INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, WAS  $280 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  $224 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS  1.0%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  AND  0.9%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  , WITH THE INCREASE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE RESULTING FROM HIGHER DEBT BALANCES.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  OUR COMBINED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS  24.5%  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  21.4%  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NONRECURRING TAX BENEFITS RELATING TO THE TAX ACT AND THE SETTLEMENT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE  $2.53  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  $2.51  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FISCAL  2019  AND FISCAL  2018  NINE  MONTH COMPARISONS  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 3,  2019  OCTOBER 28,  2018  DOLLARS IN MILLIONS  $% OF  NET SALES  $% OF  NET SALES  NET SALES  $84,443  $81,712  GROSS PROFIT  28,836  34.1%  28,133  34.4%  OPERATING EXPENSES.

OUR COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET INCREASED  1.9%  FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , DUE IN PART TO BIG TICKET PURCHASES.  DURING THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS EXCEPT FOR LUMBER AND ELECTRICAL/LIGHTING POSTED POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES. COMPARABLE SALES FOR OUR  APPLIANCES, INDOOR GARDEN, DE\u0301COR/STORAGE, TOOLS, HARDWARE,  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUTDOOR GARDEN, PLUMBING, BUILDING MATERIALS, AND PAINT  MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS WERE ABOVE THE COMPANY AVERAGE FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  . COMPARABLE SALES FOR ELECTRICAL/LIGHTING WERE SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE DUE TO THE LENGTHENING REPLACEMENT CYCLE AND PRICE DEFLATION IN LIGHT BULBS.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  TO PROVIDE CLARITY, INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY, ABOUT OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WE SUPPLEMENT OUR REPORTING WITH CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. HOWEVER, THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED GAAP MEASURES. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED HEREIN MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILAR MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL.  WE BELIEVE ROIC IS MEANINGFUL FOR INVESTORS AND MANAGEMENT BECAUSE IT MEASURES HOW EFFECTIVELY WE DEPLOY OUR CAPITAL BASE. WE DEFINE ROIC AS NOPAT, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, FOR THE MOST RECENT TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD, DIVIDED BY AVERAGE DEBT AND EQUITY. WE DEFINE AVERAGE DEBT AND EQUITY AS THE AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND ENDING LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING CURRENT INSTALLMENTS) AND EQUITY FOR THE MOST RECENT TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE CALCULATION OF ROIC, TOGETHER WITH A RECONCILIATION OF NOPAT TO NET EARNINGS (THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE), FOLLOWS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  AT  NOVEMBER 3, 2019  , WE HAD  $2.2 BILLION  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, OF WHICH  $1.8 BILLION  WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH POSITION, ACCESS TO THE LONG-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, AND FUNDS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT NOT ONLY FOR OUR OPERATING REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO TO ENABLE US TO COMPLETE OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS AND FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SHARE REPURCHASES, AND ANY REQUIRED LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL FISCAL YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING.  AS WE CONTINUE OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS, WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY  $2.7 BILLION  IN FISCAL  2019.  DEBT AND DERIVATIVES  WE HAVE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION. ALL OF OUR SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  WERE UNDER THESE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS, AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME WAS  $2.1 BILLION  . IN CONNECTION WITH THESE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITIES WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO $3.0 BILLION, WHICH CONSIST OF A FIVE-YEAR $2.0 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN DECEMBER 2022 AND A 364-DAY $1.0 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN DECEMBER 2019. AT  NOVEMBER 3, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITIES, AND NONE ARE EXPECTED TO IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES. AT  NOVEMBER 3, 2019  ,  $695 MILLION  WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS. WE ALSO ISSUE SENIOR NOTES FROM TIME TO TIME AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY.  WE USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES ON CERTAIN LONG-TERM DEBT. SEE  NOTE 4  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR SENIOR NOTES ISSUANCES AND OUR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  SHARE REPURCHASES  IN FEBRUARY 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW $15.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT REPLACED THE PREVIOUS AUTHORIZATION. IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , WE HAD CASH PAYMENTS OF  $3.9 BILLION  FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK THROUGH ASR AGREEMENTS AND OPEN MARKET PURCHASES.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOWS SUMMARY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS PROVIDES US WITH A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS RESULT PRIMARILY FROM CASH RECEIVED FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, OFFSET BY CASH PAYMENTS WE MAKE FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, OPERATIONS, AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  CASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL. WORKING CAPITAL AT ANY POINT IN TIME IS SUBJECT TO MANY VARIABLES, INCLUDING SEASONALITY, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND CATEGORY EXPANSION, THE TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS, VENDOR PAYMENT TERMS, AND FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $628 MILLION  IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  AND WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FROM THE CONTINUATION OF OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN OUR BUSINESS OF  $1.9 BILLION  DURING THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  $1.7 BILLION  OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018.

RISK FACTORS\u201d AND \u201cPART II, ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d AND THOSE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN OUR OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (\"GAAP\").  THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.  THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS AFFECTING THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  ON A REGULAR BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO TOTAL COSTS ON LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION-TYPE CONTRACTS, COSTS TO BE INCURRED FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND EXTENDED MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS, BAD DEBTS, EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY, INCOME TAXES, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AND CONTINGENCIES.  OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.  ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  OVERVIEW  WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SELL A WIDE RANGE OF DISPLAY SYSTEMS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  WE FOCUS OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS ON MARKETS, GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS AND PRODUCTS.  OUR FIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS CONSIST OF FOUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS UNITS AND THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT.  THE FOUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS UNITS CONSIST OF COMMERCIAL, LIVE EVENTS, HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION, AND TRANSPORTATION, ALL OF WHICH INCLUDE THE GEOGRAPHIC TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.  DISCLOSURES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE PROVIDED IN \"  NOTE 5. SEGMENT REPORTING  \" OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.  OUR NET SALES AND PROFITABILITY HISTORICALLY HAVE FLUCTUATED DUE TO THE IMPACT OF UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS, SUCH AS DISPLAY SYSTEMS FOR PROFESSIONAL SPORTS FACILITIES, COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, AND SPECTACULAR PROJECTS IN THE COMMERCIAL AREA, AS WELL AS THE SEASONALITY OF THE SPORTS MARKET.  UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS CAN INCLUDE SEVERAL DISPLAYS, CONTROLLERS, AND SUBCONTRACTED STRUCTURE BUILDS, EACH OF WHICH CAN OCCUR ON VARIED SCHEDULES PER THE CUSTOMER'S NEEDS.  OUTDOOR INSTALLATION SALES CAN BE IMPACTED BY OUTDOOR WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE CONSTRUCTION SEASON.  OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER TENDS TO BE A SLOWER QUARTER BECAUSE IT INCLUDES TWO HOLIDAYS, IT IS AFFECTED BY SPORTS SEASONALITY, AND GENERALLY LESS OUTDOOR CONSTRUCTION WORK OCCURS DUE TO WEATHER CONDITIONS.  OUR GROSS MARGINS TEND TO FLUCTUATE MORE ON UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS THAN ON LIMITED CONFIGURED ORDERS.  UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS INVOLVING COMPETITIVE BIDDING AND SUBSTANTIAL SUBCONTRACT WORK FOR PRODUCT INSTALLATION GENERALLY HAVE LOWER GROSS MARGINS.  ALTHOUGH WE FOLLOW THE OVER TIME METHOD OF RECOGNIZING REVENUES FOR UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS, WE NEVERTHELESS HAVE EXPERIENCED FLUCTUATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS AND EXPECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR FLUCTUATIONS.  OUR REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS (\"BACKLOG\") CONSIST OF CONTRACTUALLY BINDING SALES AGREEMENTS OR PURCHASE ORDERS FOR INTEGRATED ELECTRONIC DISPLAY SYSTEMS AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICE.  ORDERS ARE INCLUDED IN BACKLOG WHEN WE ARE IN RECEIPT OF AN EXECUTED CONTRACT AND ANY REQUIRED DEPOSITS OR SECURITY.  AS A RESULT, CERTAIN ORDERS FOR WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED BINDING LETTERS OF INTENT OR CONTRACTS WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN BACKLOG UNTIL ALL REQUIRED CONTRACTUAL DOCUMENTS AND DEPOSITS ARE RECEIVED.  BACKLOG CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO LARGE ORDER BOOKINGS AND THE TIMING AND SEASONALITY OF NET SALES.  BECAUSE ORDER BACKLOG FLUCTUATES AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO EXTENDED DELIVERY SCHEDULES, ORDERS MAY BE CANCELED AND HAVE VARIED ESTIMATED PROFITABILITY.  OUR BACKLOG IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE NET SALES OR NET INCOME.  BACKLOG IS NOT A MEASURE DEFINED BY GAAP, AND OUR METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING BACKLOG MAY VARY FROM THE METHODOLOGY USED BY OTHER COMPANIES IN DETERMINING THEIR BACKLOG AMOUNTS.  GENERAL  OUR MISSION IS TO BE THE WORLD LEADER AT INFORMING AND ENTERTAINING AUDIENCES THROUGH DYNAMIC AUDIO-VISUAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS.  WE ORGANIZE INTO BUSINESS UNITS TO FOCUS ON CUSTOMER LOYALTY OVER TIME TO EARN NEW AND REPLACEMENT BUSINESS BECAUSE OUR PRODUCTS HAVE A FINITE LIFETIME.  SEE \"  NOTE 5. SEGMENT REPORTING  \" OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  OUR STRATEGIES INCLUDE THE CREATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE LINE OF INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS AND SYSTEMS AND OUR ABILITY TO CREATE AND LEVERAGE PLATFORM DESIGNS AND TECHNOLOGIES.  THESE STRATEGIES ALIGN US TO EFFECTIVELY DELIVER VALUE TO OUR VARIED CUSTOMERS AND THEIR MARKET NEEDS, WHILE SERVING OUR STAKEHOLDERS OVER THE LONG-TERM.  WE FOCUS ON CREATING LOCAL CAPABILITIES FOR SALES, SERVICE, AND MANUFACTURING IN GEOGRAPHIES WITH EXPECTED DIGITAL MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.  WE BELIEVE CONSISTENTLY GENERATING PROFITABLE GROWTH WILL PROVIDE VALUE TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS (CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, SHAREHOLDERS, SUPPLIERS, AND COMMUNITIES).  WE MEASURE OUR SUCCESS USING A VARIETY OF MEASURES INCLUDING.  \u2022  OUR PERCENTAGE OF MARKET SHARE BY COMPARING OUR ESTIMATED REVENUE TO THE TOTAL ESTIMATED GLOBAL DIGITAL DISPLAY REVENUE,  \u2022  OUR ORDER GROWTH COMPARED TO THE OVERALL DIGITAL MARKET ORDER CHANGE,  \u2022  FINANCIAL METRICS SUCH AS ANNUAL ORDER VOLUME AND PROFIT CHANGE AS COMPARED TO OUR PREVIOUS FINANCIAL RESULTS,  \u2022  CUSTOMER RETENTION AND EXPANSION RATES, AND  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE PROFITS OVER THE LONG-TERM TO PROVIDE A SHAREHOLDER RETURN.  CERTAIN FACTORS IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN THESE STRATEGIES AND IMPACT OUR BUSINESS UNITS TO VARYING DEGREES.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE OVERALL COST TO MANUFACTURE AND THE SELLING PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS HAVE DECREASED OVER THE YEARS AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO DECREASE IN THE FUTURE.  OUR COMPETITORS OUTSIDE THE U.S. ARE IMPACTED DIFFERENTLY BY THE GLOBAL TRADE ENVIRONMENT ALLOWING THEM TO AVOID TARIFF COSTS OR REDUCE PRICES.  AS A RESULT, ADDITIONAL COMPETITORS HAVE ENTERED THE MARKET, AND EACH YEAR WE MUST SELL MORE PRODUCT TO GENERATE THE SAME OR GREATER LEVEL OF NET SALES AS IN PREVIOUS FISCAL YEARS.  HOWEVER, THE DECLINE OF DIGITAL SOLUTION PRICING OVER THE YEARS AND INCREASED USER ADOPTION AND APPLICATIONS HAVE INCREASED THE SIZE OF THE GLOBAL MARKET.  COMPETITOR OFFERINGS, ACTIONS AND REACTIONS ALSO CAN VARY AND CHANGE OVER TIME OR IN CERTAIN CUSTOMER SITUATIONS.  PROJECTS WITH MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR REVENUE POTENTIAL ATTRACTS COMPETITION, AND COMPETITORS CAN USE MARKETING OR OTHER TACTICS TO WIN BUSINESS.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EACH OF OUR BUSINESS UNIT'S LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE CAN BE IMPACTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND TO DIFFERENT DEGREES.  THE EFFECTS OF AN ADVERSE ECONOMY ARE GENERALLY LESS SEVERE ON OUR SPORTS RELATED BUSINESS AS COMPARED TO OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, ALTHOUGH IN SEVERE ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, THE SPORTS BUSINESS CAN ALSO BE SERIOUSLY IMPACTED.  WE CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT-TERM EVENTS LIKE THE U.S. ADMINISTRATIVE TRADE ACTIONS IN 2018 OR A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE DISCLOSED IN \"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\" INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  APRIL 27, 2019.  THE OUTLOOK AND UNIQUE KEY GROWTH DRIVERS AND CHALLENGES BY OUR BUSINESS UNITS INCLUDE.  COMMERCIAL BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  STANDARD DISPLAY PRODUCT MARKET GROWTH DUE TO MARKET ADOPTION AND LOWER PRODUCT COSTS, WHICH DRIVE MARKETPLACE EXPANSION.  STANDARD DISPLAY PRODUCTS ARE USED TO ATTRACT OR COMMUNICATE WITH CUSTOMERS AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS OF RETAIL, COMMERCIAL, AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS.  PRICING AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS THAT IMPACT OUR SUCCESS IN THIS BUSINESS UNIT.  WE UTILIZE A RESELLER NETWORK TO DISTRIBUTE OUR STANDARD PRODUCTS.  \u2022  NATIONAL ACCOUNTS STANDARD DISPLAY MARKET OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO CUSTOMERS' DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE THEIR MESSAGE, ADVERTISING AND CONTENT CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  INCREASED DEMAND IS POSSIBLE FROM NATIONAL RETAILERS, QUICK SERVE RESTAURANTS, PETROLEUM RETAILERS, AND OTHER NATIONWIDE ORGANIZATIONS.  \u2022  ADDITIONAL STANDARD DISPLAY OFFERINGS USING MICRO-LIGHT EMITTING DIODE (\"LED\") DESIGNS.  \u2022  INCREASING USE OF LED TECHNOLOGIES REPLACING SIGNAGE PREVIOUSLY USING LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY (\"LCD\") TECHNOLOGY BY EXISTING AND NEW CUSTOMERS.  \u2022  INCREASING INTEREST IN SPECTACULARS, WHICH INCLUDE VERY LARGE AND SOMETIMES HIGHLY CUSTOMIZED DISPLAYS AS PART OF ENTERTAINMENT VENUES SUCH AS CASINOS, SHOPPING CENTERS, CRUISE SHIPS AND TIMES SQUARE TYPE LOCATIONS.  \u2022  DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS DEMAND GROWTH DUE TO MARKET ADOPTION AND EXPANDED USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY.  \u2022  THE USE OF ARCHITECTURAL LIGHTING PRODUCTS FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, WHICH REAL ESTATE OWNERS USE TO ADD ACCENTS OR EFFECTS TO AN ENTIRE SIDE OR CIRCUMFERENCE OF A BUILDING TO COMMUNICATE MESSAGES OR TO DECORATE THE BUILDING.  \u2022  THE CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF DIGITAL BILLBOARDS AS OUT-OF-HOME (\"OOH\") ADVERTISING COMPANIES CONTINUE DEVELOPING NEW SITES AND REPLACING DIGITAL BILLBOARDS REACHING END OF LIFE.  THIS IS DEPENDENT ON NO ADVERSE CHANGES OCCURRING IN THE DIGITAL BILLBOARD REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RESTRICTING FUTURE BILLBOARD DEPLOYMENTS, AS WELL AS MAINTAINING OUR CURRENT MARKET SHARE IN A BUSINESS THAT IS CONCENTRATED IN A FEW LARGE OOH COMPANIES.  \u2022  REPLACEMENT CYCLES WITHIN EACH OF THESE AREAS.  LIVE EVENTS BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE LIVE EVENTS BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  FACILITIES SPENDING MORE ON LARGER DISPLAY SYSTEMS TO ENHANCE THE GAME-DAY AND EVENT EXPERIENCE FOR ATTENDEES.  \u2022  LOWER PRODUCT COSTS, DRIVING AN EXPANSION OF THE MARKETPLACE.  \u2022  OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL MICRO-LED OFFERINGS WHICH REMAIN THE MOST INTEGRATED AND COMPREHENSIVE OFFERINGS IN THE INDUSTRY.  \u2022  THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF SPORTS TEAMS, WHICH STRIVE TO OUT-PERFORM THEIR COMPETITORS WITH DISPLAY SYSTEMS.  \u2022  THE DESIRE FOR HIGH-DEFINITION VIDEO DISPLAYS, WHICH TYPICALLY DRIVES LARGER DISPLAYS OR HIGHER RESOLUTION DISPLAYS, BOTH OF WHICH INCREASE THE AVERAGE TRANSACTION SIZE.  \u2022  DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEM NEEDS THROUGHOUT A SPORTS FACILITY.  \u2022  INCREASING USE OF LED TECHNOLOGIES REPLACING SIGNAGE PREVIOUSLY USING LCD TECHNOLOGY IN AND SURROUNDING LIVE EVENTS FACILITIES.  \u2022  REPLACEMENT CYCLES WITHIN EACH OF THESE AREAS.  HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  INCREASED DEMAND FOR VIDEO SYSTEMS IN HIGH SCHOOLS AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS REALIZE THE REVENUE GENERATING POTENTIAL OF THESE DISPLAYS COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL SCOREBOARDS AND THESE SYSTEMS' ABILITY TO PROVIDE OR ENHANCE ACADEMIC CURRICULUM OFFERINGS FOR STUDENTS.  \u2022  INCREASED DEMAND FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISPLAYS AND DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS, SUCH AS MESSAGE CENTERS AT SCHOOLS TO COMMUNICATE TO STUDENTS, PARENTS AND THE BROADER COMMUNITY.  \u2022  LOWER SYSTEM COSTS DRIVING THE USE OF MORE SOPHISTICATED DISPLAYS IN SCHOOL ATHLETIC FACILITIES, SUCH AS LARGE INTEGRATED VIDEO SYSTEMS.  \u2022  EXPANDING CONTROL SYSTEM OPTIONS TAILORED FOR THE MARKETS' NEEDS.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM INCREASING APPLICATIONS AND ACCEPTANCE OF ELECTRONIC DISPLAYS TO MANAGE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, INCLUDING ROADWAY, AIRPORT, PARKING, TRANSIT AND OTHER APPLICATIONS.  EFFECTIVE USE OF THE UNITED STATES TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRES INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS.  THIS GROWTH IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT SPENDING, PRIMARILY BY STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS, ALONG WITH THE CONTINUING ACCEPTANCE OF PRIVATE/PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS AS AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE.  GROWTH IS ALSO EXPECTED IN DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS FOR ADVERTISING AND WAY-FINDING USE IN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND AIRPORT TERMINALS DUE TO EXPANDED MARKET USAGE AND DISPLAYS, WITH LED TECHNOLOGY REPLACING PRIOR LCD INSTALLATIONS AND ADDITIONAL DISPLAY OFFERINGS USING MICRO-LEDS.  INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM ACHIEVING GREATER PENETRATION IN VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIES AND BUILDING PRODUCTS MORE SUITED TO INDIVIDUAL MARKETS.  WE CONTINUE TO BROADEN OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS INTO THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT IN EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST.  WE ALSO FOCUS ON SPORTS FACILITY, SPECTACULAR-TYPE, OOH ADVERTISING PRODUCTS, AND ARCHITECTURAL LIGHTING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND THE FACTORS LISTED IN EACH OF THE OTHER BUSINESS UNITS TO THE EXTENT THEY APPLY OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.  ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES EXIST WITH EXPANDED MARKET USAGE OF LED TECHNOLOGY DUE TO PRICE CONSIDERATIONS, USAGE OF LED TECHNOLOGY REPLACING PRIOR LCD INSTALLATIONS AND ADDITIONAL DISPLAY OFFERINGS USING MICRO-LEDS.

THE  DECREASE  IN NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD ONE YEAR AGO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF LARGE CUSTOM PROJECTS IN THE SPECTACULAR NICHE AND LIGHTER DEMAND IN THE ON-PREMISE NICHE, WHILE THE OOH NICHE REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE  DECREASE  IN ORDERS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD ONE YEAR AGO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SOFTER MARKET IN THE ON-PREMISE AND OOH NICHES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LARGE ORDERS IN THE SPECTACULAR NICHE.  LIVE EVENTS.  THE  INCREASE  IN NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD ONE YEAR AGO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF THE DEMAND FOR UPGRADED OR NEW SOLUTIONS FOR ARENAS AND PROFESSIONAL SPORTS STADIUMS.

THE  DECREASE  IN OUR GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD ONE YEAR AGO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN TARIFF RELATED EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 MILLION, OR A 0.6% IMPACT TO GROSS PROFIT, AS LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME TARIFFS WERE JUST BEING INTRODUCED ON US IMPORTS OF ALUMINUM, STEEL, AND COMPONENTS FROM CHINA.  WE ALSO EXPERIENCED ADDITIONAL EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $3.0 MILLION FOR PROJECT DELIVERY COSTS AND FOR AN EXISTING LITIGATION CLAIM ESTIMATE.  TOTAL WARRANTY AS A PERCENT OF SALES DECREASED TO 2.2% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  AS COMPARED TO 2.5% DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 27, 2018  .  THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES THE OVERALL IMPACT BY BUSINESS UNIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD ONE YEAR AGO.  THE GROSS PROFIT PERCENT DECREASED IN OUR COMMERCIAL, LIVE EVENTS, AND HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION BUSINESS UNITS FOR THE REASONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

ON NOVEMBER 15, 2016, WE ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED LOAN AGREEMENT AND A RELATED REVOLVING NOTE AND CONTINUING AND UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTY AGREEMENT WITH ANOTHER BANK WHICH SUPPORTED OUR CREDIT NEEDS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.  THE REVOLVING AMOUNT OF THE LOAN WAS $20.0 MILLION, WITH A MATURITY DATE OF NOVEMBER 15, 2019.  AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , THERE WERE NO ADVANCES OUTSTANDING UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT.  WE DID NOT RENEW THIS AGREEMENT.  THEREFORE, THE LOAN AGREEMENT AND RELATED REVOLVING NOTE AND GUARANTY EXPIRED AND TERMINATED ACCORDING TO THEIR TERMS ON NOVEMBER 15, 2019, AND WE HAVE NO CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITY UNDER THIS LOAN AGREEMENT, REVOLVING NOTE, AND GUARANTY.  WE ARE SOMETIMES REQUIRED TO OBTAIN BANK GUARANTEES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR DISPLAY INSTALLATIONS AND WE HAVE A GLOBAL BANKING RELATIONSHIP TO PROVIDE SUCH INSTRUMENTS.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET THE TERMS OF THE ARRANGEMENT, OUR CUSTOMER WOULD DRAW ON THE BANKING ARRANGEMENT, AND THE BANK WOULD SUBROGATE ITS LOSS TO DAKTRONICS.  AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , WE HAD  $5.6 MILLION  OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS OUTSTANDING.  WE ARE SOMETIMES REQUIRED TO OBTAIN PERFORMANCE BONDS FOR DISPLAY INSTALLATIONS, AND WE HAVE A BONDING LINE AVAILABLE THROUGH A SURETY COMPANY FOR AN AGGREGATE OF $150.0 MILLION IN BONDED WORK OUTSTANDING.  IF WE WERE UNABLE TO COMPLETE THE WORK, AND OUR CUSTOMER WOULD CALL UPON THE BOND FOR PAYMENT, THE SURETY COMPANY WOULD SUBROGATE ITS LOSS TO DAKTRONICS.  AT  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , WE HAD  $8.4 MILLION  OF BONDED WORK OUTSTANDING AGAINST THIS LINE.  OUR BUSINESS GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES DEPEND ON INVESTMENTS IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS.  WE ARE PROJECTING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE LESS THAN $25 MILLION FOR  FISCAL 2020  FOR PURCHASES OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT FOR NEW OR ENHANCED PRODUCT PRODUCTION, EXPANDED CAPACITY, INVESTMENTS IN QUALITY AND RELIABILITY EQUIPMENT, AND CONTINUED INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS.  WE ALSO EVALUATE AND MAY INVEST IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR ACQUIRE COMPANIES ALIGNED WITH OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY.  WE BELIEVE OUR WORKING CAPITAL AVAILABLE FROM ALL SOURCES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET THE CASH REQUIREMENTS OF OUR OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  IF OUR GROWTH EXTENDS BEYOND CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, OR IF WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS, WE MAY NEED TO UTILIZE AND POSSIBLY INCREASE OUR CREDIT FACILITIES OR SEEK OTHER MEANS OF FINANCING.  WE ANTICIPATE WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ANY NEEDED FUNDS UNDER COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS FROM OUR CURRENT LENDERS OR OTHER SOURCES, ALTHOUGH THIS AVAILABILITY CANNOT BE GUARANTEED.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE HAS BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS SINCE THE END OF OUR  2019  FISCAL YEAR ON  APRIL 27, 2019  .

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, TOGETHER WITH \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  WE BEGIN OUR DISCUSSION WITH AN OVERVIEW OF OUR COMPANY TO GIVE YOU AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR BUSINESS AND THE MARKETS WE SERVE. WE THEN DISCUSS OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. THIS IS FOLLOWED WITH A DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018. THIS DISCUSSION INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT PERIOD-TO-PERIOD VARIANCES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE DISCUSSED UNDER THE CAPTION \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.\u201d  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  AMERISAFE IS A HOLDING COMPANY THAT MARKETS AND UNDERWRITES WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION INSURANCE THROUGH ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION INSURANCE COVERS STATUTORILY PRESCRIBED BENEFITS THAT EMPLOYERS ARE OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE INJURED IN THE COURSE AND SCOPE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING THIS COVERAGE TO SMALL TO MID-SIZED EMPLOYERS ENGAGED IN HAZARDOUS INDUSTRIES, PRINCIPALLY CONSTRUCTION, TRUCKING, LOGGING AND LUMBER, MANUFACTURING, AND AGRICULTURE. EMPLOYERS ENGAGED IN HAZARDOUS INDUSTRIES PAY SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN AVERAGE RATES FOR WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION INSURANCE COMPARED TO EMPLOYERS IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, AS MEASURED PER PAYROLL DOLLAR. THE HIGHER PREMIUM RATES ARE DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE WORK PERFORMED AND THE INHERENT WORKPLACE DANGER OF OUR TARGET EMPLOYERS. HAZARDOUS INDUSTRY EMPLOYERS ALSO TEND TO HAVE LESS FREQUENT BUT MORE SEVERE CLAIMS AS COMPARED TO EMPLOYERS IN OTHER INDUSTRIES DUE TO THE NATURE OF THEIR BUSINESSES. WE PROVIDE PROACTIVE SAFETY REVIEWS OF EMPLOYERS\u2019 WORKPLACES. THESE SAFETY REVIEWS ARE A VITAL COMPONENT OF OUR UNDERWRITING PROCESS AND ALSO PROMOTE SAFER WORKPLACES. WE UTILIZE INTENSIVE CLAIMS MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT WE BELIEVE PERMIT US TO REDUCE THE OVERALL COST OF OUR CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, OUR AUDIT SERVICES ENSURE THAT OUR POLICYHOLDERS PAY THE APPROPRIATE PREMIUMS REQUIRED UNDER THE TERMS OF THEIR POLICIES AND ENABLE US TO MONITOR PAYROLL PATTERNS THAT CAUSE UNDERWRITING, SAFETY OR FRAUD CONCERNS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE HIGHER PREMIUMS TYPICALLY PAID BY OUR POLICYHOLDERS, TOGETHER WITH OUR DISCIPLINED UNDERWRITING AND SAFETY, CLAIMS AND AUDIT SERVICES, PROVIDE US WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN ATTRACTIVE RETURNS FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  WE ACTIVELY MARKET OUR INSURANCE IN 27 STATES THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENCIES, AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR WHOLLY OWNED INSURANCE AGENCY SUBSIDIARY. WE ARE ALSO LICENSED IN AN ADDITIONAL 20 STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  UNDERSTANDING OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS KEY TO UNDERSTANDING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS SOME OF THESE POLICIES TO BE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE PRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE US TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. SOME OF THE ESTIMATES RESULT FROM JUDGMENTS THAT CAN BE SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ACTUAL RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS MIGHT DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES RELATE TO THE REPORTING OF RESERVES FOR LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, INCLUDING LOSSES THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT HAVE NOT BEEN REPORTED PRIOR TO THE REPORTING DATE, AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE FROM REINSURERS, PREMIUMS RECEIVABLE, ASSESSMENTS, DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES, THE IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN ITEM 7, \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  22  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018.

GROSS PREMIUMS WRITTEN FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE $82.6 MILLION, COMPARED TO $85.3 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, A DECREASE OF 3.2%. THE DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A $7.3 MILLION DECREASE IN ANNUAL PREMIUMS ON VOLUNTARY POLICIES WRITTEN DURING THE PERIOD. OFFSETTING THIS DECREASE WAS A $4.1 MILLION INCREASE IN PREMIUMS RESULTING FROM PAYROLL AUDITS AND RELATED PREMIUM ADJUSTMENTS FOR POLICIES WRITTEN IN PREVIOUS QUARTERS AND A $0.4 MILLION INCREASE IN ASSUMED PREMIUM FROM MANDATORY POOLING ARRANGEMENTS. THE EFFECTIVE LOSS COST MULTIPLIER, OR ELCM, FOR OUR VOLUNTARY BUSINESS WAS 1.62 FOR THE THIRD QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 1.65 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN  .

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DECREASE IN NET PREMIUMS WRITTEN DURING THE PERIOD.  NET INVESTMENT INCOME  . NET INVESTMENT INCOME FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $8.3 MILLION, COMPARED TO $7.9 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, AN INCREASE OF 4.8%.  THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO SLIGHTLY HIGHER INVESTMENT YIELDS ON FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES.  AVERAGE INVESTED ASSETS, INCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, WERE $1.2 BILLION IN THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018. THE PRE-TAX INVESTMENT YIELD ON OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WAS 2.7% PER ANNUM DURING THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 2.6% PER ANNUM DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE TAX-EQUIVALENT YIELD ON OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WAS 3.1% PER ANNUM FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 3.0% FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE TAX-EQUIVALENT YIELD IS CALCULATED USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE AND THE APPROPRIATE MARGINAL TAX RATE.  NET REALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) ON INVESTMENTS  . NET REALIZED LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE IMMATERIAL COMPARED TO LOSSES OF $0.3 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.

THE CURRENT ACCIDENT YEAR LOSS AND LAE INCURRED WERE $60.0 MILLION, OR 72.5% OF NET PREMIUMS EARNED, COMPARED TO $60.9 MILLION, OR 71.5% OF NET PREMIUMS EARNED FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. WE RECORDED FAVORABLE PRIOR ACCIDENT YEAR DEVELOPMENT OF $15.6 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, COMPARED TO FAVORABLE PRIOR ACCIDENT YEAR DEVELOPMENT OF $13.3 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018, AS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW IN \u201cPRIOR YEAR DEVELOPMENT.\u201d OUR NET LOSS RATIO WAS 53.6% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, COMPARED TO 55.9% FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018.

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR INCURRED AMOUNTS FOR CERTAIN ACCIDENT YEARS, PARTICULARLY 2014 THROUGH 2017, DEVELOPED MORE FAVORABLY THAN MANAGEMENT PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. THE REVISIONS TO THE COMPANY\u2019S RESERVES REFLECT NEW INFORMATION GAINED BY CLAIMS ADJUSTERS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF ADJUSTING CLAIMS AND IS REFLECTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHEN THE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. IT IS TYPICAL FOR MORE SERIOUS CLAIMS TO TAKE SEVERAL YEARS OR LONGER TO SETTLE AND THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVISES ESTIMATES AS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT CLAIMANTS\u2019 MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND POTENTIAL DISABILITY BECOMES KNOWN AND THE CLAIMS GET CLOSER TO BEING SETTLED.  MULTIPLE FACTORS CAN CAUSE BOTH FAVORABLE AND UNFAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT. THE FAVORABLE LOSS DEVELOPMENT WE EXPERIENCED ACROSS ACCIDENT YEARS WAS LARGELY DUE TO FAVORABLE CASE RESERVE DEVELOPMENT FROM CLOSED CLAIMS AND CLAIMS WHERE THE WORKER HAD REACHED MAXIMUM MEDICAL IMPROVEMENT.  THE ASSUMPTIONS WE USED IN ESTABLISHING OUR RESERVES WERE BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL CLAIMS DATA. HOWEVER, AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, ACTUAL RESULTS FOR CERTAIN ACCIDENT YEARS HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN OUR ASSUMPTIONS WOULD HAVE PREDICTED. WE DO NOT PRESENTLY INTEND TO MODIFY OUR ASSUMPTIONS FOR ESTABLISHING RESERVES IN LIGHT OF RECENT RESULTS. HOWEVER, IF ACTUAL RESULTS FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE ACCIDENT YEARS ARE CONSISTENT WITH, OR DIFFERENT THAN, OUR RESULTS IN THESE RECENT ACCIDENT YEARS, OUR HISTORICAL CLAIMS DATA WILL REFLECT THIS CHANGE AND, OVER TIME, WILL IMPACT THE RESERVES WE ESTABLISH FOR FUTURE CLAIMS.  OUR RESERVES FOR LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND OUR FOCUS ON PROVIDING WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION INSURANCE TO EMPLOYERS ENGAGED IN HAZARDOUS INDUSTRIES RESULTS IN OUR RECEIVING RELATIVELY FEWER BUT MORE SEVERE CLAIMS THAN MANY OTHER WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION INSURANCE COMPANIES. AS A RESULT OF THIS FOCUS ON HIGHER SEVERITY, LOWER FREQUENCY BUSINESS, OUR RESERVE FOR LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY HAVE GREATER VOLATILITY THAN OTHER WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION INSURANCE COMPANIES.

WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT OIL AND NATURAL GAS COMPANY INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE IN 1994, BUT OUR ROOTS GO BACK NEARLY 70 YEARS TO OUR COMPANY\u2019S ESTABLISHMENT IN 1950. WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF UNCONVENTIONAL ONSHORE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES IN THE PERMIAN BASIN. THE PERMIAN BASIN IS LOCATED IN WEST TEXAS AND SOUTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO AND IS COMPRISED OF THREE PRIMARY SUB-BASINS: THE MIDLAND BASIN, THE DELAWARE BASIN, AND THE CENTRAL BASIN PLATFORM. SINCE OUR ENTRY INTO THE PERMIAN BASIN IN LATE 2009, WE HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN FOCUSED ON THE MIDLAND BASIN AND MORE RECENTLY ENTERED THE DELAWARE BASIN THROUGH AN ACQUISITION COMPLETED IN FEBRUARY 2017. WE FURTHER EXPANDED OUR PRESENCE IN THE DELAWARE BASIN THROUGH OUR ACQUISITIONS IN 2018. OUR OPERATING CULTURE IS CENTERED ON RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT OF HYDROCARBON RESOURCES, SAFETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, WHICH WE BELIEVE STRENGTHENS OUR OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE. OUR DRILLING ACTIVITY IS FOCUSED ON THE HORIZONTAL DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERAL PROSPECTIVE INTERVALS, INCLUDING MULTIPLE LEVELS OF THE WOLFCAMP FORMATION AND THE LOWER SPRABERRY SHALES. WE HAVE ASSEMBLED A MULTI-YEAR INVENTORY OF POTENTIAL HORIZONTAL WELL LOCATIONS AND INTEND TO ADD TO THIS INVENTORY THROUGH DELINEATION DRILLING OF EMERGING ZONES ON OUR EXISTING ACREAGE AND ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS THROUGH WORKING INTEREST ACQUISITIONS, LEASING PROGRAMS, ACREAGE PURCHASES, JOINT VENTURES AND ASSET SWAPS.

ON JULY 18, 2019, WE REDEEMED ALL OUTSTANDING SHARES OF THE PREFERRED STOCK AT A REDEMPTION PRICE OF  $50.24  PER SHARE FOR A TOTAL REDEMPTION OF  $73 MILLION  . AFTER THE REDEMPTION DATE, THE PREFERRED STOCK WERE NO LONGER DEEMED OUTSTANDING, DIVIDENDS ON THE PREFERRED STOCK CEASED TO ACCRUE, AND ALL RIGHTS OF THE HOLDERS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PREFERRED STOCK WERE TERMINATED, EXCEPT THE RIGHT OF THE HOLDERS TO RECEIVE THE REDEMPTION PRICE, WITHOUT INTEREST.  IN JULY 2019, CALLON AND CARRIZO ENTERED INTO THE MERGER AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO WHICH, UPON THE TERMS AND SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS SET FORTH THEREIN, CARRIZO WILL MERGE WITH AND INTO CALLON, WITH CALLON AS THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. THE COMBINATION WILL RESULT IN A PORTFOLIO OF CORE OIL-WEIGHTED ASSETS IN BOTH THE PERMIAN BASIN AND EAGLE FORD SHALE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT THE ACQUISITION WILL CLOSE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. SEE  NOTE 13  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE CARRIZO ACQUISITION.

PRODUCTION TAXES.  PRODUCTION TAXES INCLUDE SEVERANCE AND AD VALOREM TAXES. IN GENERAL, PRODUCTION TAXES ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO COMMODITY PRICE CHANGES; HOWEVER, SEVERANCE TAXES ARE BASED UPON CURRENT YEAR COMMODITY PRICES, WHEREAS AD VALOREM TAXES ARE BASED UPON PRIOR YEAR COMMODITY PRICES. SEVERANCE TAXES ARE PAID ON PRODUCED OIL AND NATURAL GAS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES FROM PRODUCTS SOLD AT FIXED RATES ESTABLISHED BY FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL TAXING AUTHORITIES. WHERE AVAILABLE, WE BENEFIT FROM TAX CREDITS AND EXEMPTIONS IN OUR VARIOUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. IN THE COUNTIES WHERE OUR PRODUCTION IS LOCATED, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO AD VALOREM TAXES, WHICH ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THE TAXING JURISDICTIONS\u2019 VALUATION OF OUR OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES.

ON A PER BOE BASIS, PRODUCTION TAXES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  INCREASED  BY  7%  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF  2018.  THE INCREASE IN PRODUCTION TAXES IS PARTIALLY DUE TO HIGHER SEVERANCE TAXES AS A RESULT OF HIGHER REVENUES. SEVERANCE TAXES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE WERE CONSISTENT ACROSS THE COMPARABLE PERIODS AT APPROXIMATELY 5%. ADDITIONALLY, AD VALOREM TAXES INCREASED $2.2 MILLION OVER THE COMPARATIVE PERIODS DUE TO A HIGHER VALUATION OF OUR OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES BY THE TAXING JURISDICTIONS AND PREVIOUS ACQUISITIONS.

DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201cDD&A\u201d).  UNDER THE FULL COST ACCOUNTING METHOD, WE CAPITALIZE COSTS WITHIN A COST CENTER AND THEN SYSTEMATICALLY EXPENSE THOSE COSTS ON A UNITS-OF-PRODUCTION BASIS BASED ON PROVED OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVE QUANTITIES. WE CALCULATE DEPLETION ON THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF COSTS: (I) ALL CAPITALIZED COSTS, OTHER THAN THE COST OF INVESTMENTS IN UNEVALUATED PROPERTIES, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION; (II) THE ESTIMATED FUTURE EXPENDITURES TO BE INCURRED IN DEVELOPING PROVED RESERVES; AND (III) THE ESTIMATED DISMANTLEMENT AND ABANDONMENT COSTS, NET OF ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUES.  DD&A RATES FLUCTUATE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN FINDING AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, ACQUISITIONS, IMPAIRMENTS, AND CHANGES IN PROVED RESERVES. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , DD&A EXPENSE WAS  $56.0 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $48.3 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF  2018  . THE ADDITIONAL DD&A WAS RELATED TO A  8%  INCREASE  IN PRODUCTION VOLUMES COMBINED WITH HIGHER DD&A RATES BETWEEN THE PERIODS, WHICH RESULTED IN $4.0 MILLION AND $3.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF INCREMENTAL DD&A EXPENSE BEING INCURRED DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019.

THE PRIMARY FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASED DD&A RATE WERE HIGHER DRILLING AND COMPLETION COSTS FOR NEW WELLS PLACED ON PRODUCTION OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS RELATIVE TO OUR HISTORICAL RATE. ADDITIONALLY, THE RATE INCREASE CAN BE PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTED TO RECENT DISPOSITIONS WITH A LOWER RELATIVE COST PER BOE.  FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , DD&A EXPENSE WAS  $178.7 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $122.4 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF  2018  .

THIS REDUCTION IN FINANCING ACTIVITY AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 CAN ALSO BE PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTED TO FUNDING OUR DELAWARE ASSET ACQUISITION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.  32  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED (IN THOUSANDS).  \ufeff  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  \ufeff  2019  2018  $ CHANGE  NET BORROWINGS ON CREDIT FACILITY  $\u2014  $40,000  $(40,000  )  ISSUANCE OF 6.375% SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE 2026  \u2014  400,000  (400,000  )  ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK  \u2014  288,364  (288,364  )  PAYMENT OF PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS  (3,997  )  (5,471  )  1,474  PAYMENT OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS  (31  )  (9,960  )  9,929  TAX WITHHOLDINGS RELATED TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS  (2,174  )  (1,804  )  (370  )  REDEMPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK  (73,017  )  \u2014  (73,017  )  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $(79,219  )  $711,129  $(790,348  )  SEE  NOTES 5  AND  9  IN THE FOOTNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR DEBT AND EQUITY TRANSACTIONS.  CAPITAL PLAN AND YEAR TO DATE  2019  SUMMARY  OUR ORIGINAL OPERATIONAL CAPITAL BUDGET FOR  2019  WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE RANGE OF $500 TO $525 MILLION ON AN ACCRUAL, OR GAAP, BASIS, RUNNING AN AVERAGE OF FIVE DRILLING RIGS TO SUPPORT LARGER, AND MORE EFFICIENT, MULTI-WELL PAD DEVELOPMENT. IN JUNE 2019, WE LOWERED OUR ANNUAL OPERATIONAL CAPITAL BUDGET TO A RANGE OF $495 TO $520 MILLION TO REFLECT REALIZED EFFICIENCIES AND COST REDUCTIONS. OF THIS RANGE, APPROXIMATELY 15% IS COMPRISED OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND FACILITIES CAPITAL. IN ADDITION TO THE OPERATIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BUDGET, WHICH INCLUDES WELL COSTS, FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE CAPITAL, AND SURFACE LAND PURCHASES, WE BUDGETED AN ESTIMATED $100 TO $105 MILLION FOR CAPITALIZED INTEREST AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  OPERATIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING OTHER ITEMS, ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS WERE  $405.1 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . DURING THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE PLACED  47  GROSS (  42.7  NET) HORIZONTAL WELLS ON PRODUCTION. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAVE BUILT A DRILLED, UNCOMPLETED INVENTORY OF  18  GROSS (  13.1  NET) WELLS TO SUPPORT A TRANSITION TO LARGER PAD DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION TO THE OPERATIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,  $27.4 MILLION  OF CAPITALIZED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND  $56.7 MILLION  OF CAPITALIZED INTEREST EXPENSES WERE ACCRUED IN THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  OUR REVENUES, EARNINGS, LIQUIDITY AND ABILITY TO GROW ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON THE PRICES WE RECEIVE FOR, AND OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP OUR RESERVES OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS. WE BELIEVE THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR OUR BUSINESS IS FAVORABLE DUE TO OUR RESOURCE BASE, LOW COST STRUCTURE, FINANCIAL STRENGTH, RISK MANAGEMENT, AND DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT OF CAPITAL. WE MONITOR CURRENT AND EXPECTED MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE COMMODITY PRICE ENVIRONMENT, AND OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND MAY ADJUST OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENT PLAN ACCORDINGLY.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  WE ARE A MARYLAND REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST, OR \"REIT,\" FORMED IN AUGUST 2012 THAT SPECIALIZES IN ACQUIRING, INVESTING IN, AND MANAGING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE- AND REAL ESTATE-RELATED ASSETS. OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO GENERATE ATTRACTIVE CURRENT YIELDS AND RISK-ADJUSTED TOTAL RETURNS FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS BY MAKING INVESTMENTS THAT WE BELIEVE COMPENSATE US APPROPRIATELY FOR THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. WE SEEK TO ATTAIN THIS OBJECTIVE BY CONSTRUCTING AND ACTIVELY MANAGING A PORTFOLIO CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, OR \"RMBS,\" FOR WHICH THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE GUARANTEED BY A U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR A U.S. GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTITY, OR \"AGENCY RMBS,\" AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, RMBS THAT DO NOT CARRY SUCH GUARANTEES, OR \"NON-AGENCY RMBS,\" SUCH AS RMBS BACKED BY PRIME JUMBO, ALTERNATIVE A-PAPER, MANUFACTURED HOUSING, AND SUBPRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. WE ALSO MAY OPPORTUNISTICALLY ACQUIRE AND MANAGE OTHER TYPES OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-RELATED AND REAL ESTATE-RELATED ASSET CLASSES, SUCH AS RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS, OR \"MSRS,\" AND CREDIT RISK TRANSFER SECURITIES, OR \"CRTS.\" WE BELIEVE THAT BEING ABLE TO COMBINE AGENCY RMBS WITH NON-AGENCY RMBS AND OTHER RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE- AND REAL ESTATE-RELATED ASSET CLASSES ENABLES US TO BALANCE A RANGE OF MORTGAGE-RELATED RISKS.  WE WERE FORMED THROUGH AN INITIAL STRATEGIC VENTURE AMONG AFFILIATES OF ELLINGTON MANAGEMENT GROUP, L.L.C., AN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM AND REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISER WITH A 24-YEAR HISTORY OF INVESTING IN A BROAD SPECTRUM OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, OR \"MBS,\" AND RELATED DERIVATIVES, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE RMBS MARKET, AND THE BLACKSTONE TACTICAL OPPORTUNITY FUNDS, OR THE \"BLACKSTONE FUNDS.\" AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THE BLACKSTONE FUNDS OWNED APPROXIMATELY 25% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES. WE ARE EXTERNALLY MANAGED AND ADVISED BY OUR MANAGER, AN AFFILIATE OF ELLINGTON.  WE USE LEVERAGE IN OUR AGENCY RMBS STRATEGY AND, WHILE WE HAVE NOT DONE SO MEANINGFULLY TO DATE, WE MAY USE LEVERAGE IN OUR NON-AGENCY RMBS STRATEGY AS WELL, ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT SUCH LEVERAGE TO BE LOWER. WE HAVE FINANCED OUR  34  PURCHASES OF AGENCY RMBS EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, WHICH WE ACCOUNT FOR AS COLLATERALIZED BORROWINGS. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS IN THE AMOUNT OF  $1.3 BILLION  WITH  14  COUNTERPARTIES.  WE HAVE ELECTED TO BE TAXED AS A REIT FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, WE GENERALLY WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES ON OUR TAXABLE INCOME THAT WE DISTRIBUTE CURRENTLY TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AS LONG AS WE MAINTAIN OUR QUALIFICATION AS A REIT. WE INTEND TO CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS SO THAT NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, AS AMENDED, OR THE \"INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT.\"  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , OUR BOOK VALUE PER SHARE WAS $12.42, AS COMPARED TO $12.40 AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 AND $12.30 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018.  TRENDS AND RECENT MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  MARKET OVERVIEW  \u2022  AT ITS JULY 2019 MEETING, AS WIDELY EXPECTED, THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE, OR THE \"FEDERAL RESERVE,\" REDUCED THE TARGET RANGE FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE BY 25 BASIS POINTS TO 2.00%\u20132.25%, WHICH WAS ITS FIRST REDUCTION SINCE 2008. AT ITS NEXT MEETING, IN SEPTEMBER 2019, THE FEDERAL RESERVE REDUCED THE TARGET RANGE BY AN ADDITIONAL 25 BASIS POINTS, TO 1.75%\u20132.00%. NOTABLY, NEITHER DECISION WAS UNANIMOUS AMONG MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE, LEAVING THE OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE REDUCTIONS UNCLEAR.  \u2022  ALSO AT ITS JULY 2019 MEETING, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD END THE TAPERING OF ITS U.S. TREASURY SECURITY REINVESTMENTS ON AUGUST 1, 2019, TWO MONTHS EARLIER THAN PREVIOUSLY PLANNED. ADDITIONALLY, IT WOULD REINVEST PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS FROM AGENCY RMBS INTO U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, UP TO $20 BILLION PER MONTH; AND IT WOULD REINVEST PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS IN EXCESS OF $20 BILLION INTO AGENCY RMBS.  \u2022  DURING THE WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 16, 2019, INTEREST RATES ON OVERNIGHT REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, OR \"REPO,\" SPIKED TO UNUSUALLY HIGH LEVELS. IN RESPONSE, THE FEDERAL RESERVE CONDUCTED OVERNIGHT AND TERM REPO OPERATIONS TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO THE REPO MARKET, AND REPO RATES NORMALIZED AS A RESULT. TO HELP PREVENT FUTURE SPIKES IN OVERNIGHT REPO RATES, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ANNOUNCED IN OCTOBER THAT IT WOULD EXPAND ITS ONGOING PURCHASES OF SHORT-TERM U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES.  \u2022  LIBOR RATES, WHICH DRIVE MANY OF OUR FINANCING COSTS, DECLINED AGAIN DURING THE THIRD QUARTER, WITH ONE-MONTH LIBOR DECREASING 38 BASIS POINTS TO END THE QUARTER AT 2.02%, AND THREE-MONTH LIBOR FALLING 23 BASIS POINTS TO 2.09%.  \u2022  MEDIUM-TERM AND LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES ALSO DROPPED AGAIN DURING THE THIRD QUARTER. THE 2-YEAR U.S. TREASURY YIELD FELL 13 BASIS POINTS TO END THE THIRD QUARTER AT 1.62%, WHILE THE 10-YEAR U.S. TREASURY YIELD DECLINED 34 BASIS POINTS TO 1.66%. FROM AUGUST 26  TH  THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2  ND  , 2-YEAR AND 10-YEAR TREASURY YIELDS WERE INVERTED, WHICH HAD NOT HAPPENED SINCE JUNE 2007. AS OF THE END OF THE QUARTER, THE ENTIRE 2-MONTH THROUGH 5-YEAR SEGMENT OF THE U.S. TREASURY YIELD CURVE WAS INVERTED, WITH 2-MONTH U.S. TREASURY BILLS YIELDING 1.86%, AND 5-YEAR U.S. TREASURY NOTES YIELDING 1.54%.  \u2022  MORTGAGE RATES CONTINUED TO FALL IN THE THIRD QUARTER, WITH THE FREDDIE MAC SURVEY 30-YEAR MORTGAGE RATE DECREASING 9 BASIS POINTS TO END THE QUARTER AT 3.64%.  \u2022  DURING THE QUARTER, PREPAYMENTS CONTINUED TO RISE AS MORTGAGE RATES DECLINED. OVERALL FANNIE MAE 30-YEAR MBS PREPAYMENTS STEADILY INCREASED FROM A CPR OF 12.8 IN JUNE, TO 16.5 IN JULY, 17.4 IN AUGUST, AND 19.3 IN SEPTEMBER. THE MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSOCIATION'S REFINANCE INDEX, WHICH MEASURES REFINANCING APPLICATION VOLUMES, WAS UP 14% QUARTER OVER QUARTER AND 133% YEAR OVER YEAR, TO ITS HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE JULY 2016.  \u2022  U.S. REAL GDP INCREASED AT AN ESTIMATED ANNUALIZED RATE OF 2.0% IN THE THIRD QUARTER, WHICH WAS THE SAME RATE OF GROWTH AS THAT OF THE PREVIOUS QUARTER. TOTAL UNEMPLOYMENT DECLINED IN THE THIRD QUARTER TO 3.5%, COMPARED TO 3.7% AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER.  \u2022  FOR THE THIRD QUARTER, THE BLOOMBERG BARCLAYS U.S. MBS INDEX GENERATED A RETURN OF 1.43%, AND A POSITIVE EXCESS RETURN (ON A DURATION-ADJUSTED BASIS) OF 0.06% RELATIVE TO THE BLOOMBERG BARCLAYS U.S. TREASURY INDEX, REFLECTING THAT AGENCY RMBS SLIGHTLY OUTPERFORMED THEIR BENCHMARK HEDGING INSTRUMENTS DURING THE QUARTER. THE BLOOMBERG BARCLAYS U.S. CORPORATE BOND INDEX GENERATED A RETURN OF 3.35% AND AN EXCESS RETURN OF 0.16%, WHILE THE BLOOMBERG BARCLAYS U.S. CORPORATE HIGH YIELD BOND INDEX GENERATED A RETURN OF 1.47% AND AN EXCESS RETURN OF 0.28%.  THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 FOLLOWED A SIMILAR PATTERN TO THE PREVIOUS QUARTER: A QUIET FIRST MONTH PRECEDED A VOLATILE SECOND MONTH, AND THEN MARKETS RECOVERED IN THE FINAL MONTH OF THE QUARTER. CHANGING MARKET SENTIMENT AROUND TRADE NEGOTIATIONS, FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY, GLOBAL GROWTH PROSPECTS, AND GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE FLUCTUATIONS.  35  IN JULY, THE MARKET WAS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT U.S./CHINA TRADE NEGOTIATIONS, AND ANTICIPATED AN INTEREST RATE CUT BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. DURING THE MONTH, THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE, OR \"DJIA,\" S&P 500, AND NASDAQ INDICES ALL HIT RECORD HIGHS. ON JULY 31ST, THE FEDERAL RESERVE INDEED CUT SHORT TERM RATES BY 25 BASIS POINTS, AND ANNOUNCED AN END TO ITS U.S. TREASURY SECURITY PORTFOLIO RUNOFF TWO MONTHS EARLY.  SENTIMENT FLIPPED IN AUGUST AND SIGNIFICANT MARKET VOLATILITY RETURNED, AS MESSAGING FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE SHIFTED HAWKISH, CONCERNS OVER GLOBAL GROWTH INTENSIFIED, AND U.S. TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHINA GREW TENSE FOLLOWING CHINA'S DEVALUATION OF ITS CURRENCY. DURING THE MONTH, THE MERRILL LYNCH OPTION VOLATILITY ESTIMATE INDEX, OR \"MOVE INDEX,\" HIT A 3.5-YEAR HIGH, AND THE VIX VOLATILITY INDEX SPIKED TO ITS HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. MEANWHILE, DOMESTIC EQUITIES FELL, INTEREST RATES PLUMMETED, VARIOUS PARTS OF THE YIELD CURVE INVERTED, AND YIELD SPREADS ON MANY FIXED INCOME ASSETS FLUCTUATED. OVER THE COURSE OF THE MONTH, THE S&P 500 DECLINED BY 1.8% WHILE THE YIELD ON THE 10-YEAR U.S. TREASURY FELL BY 52 BASIS POINTS, FINISHING THE MONTH BELOW THE YIELD ON THE 2-YEAR U.S. TREASURY.  THE FEDERAL RESERVE RESPONDED TO THE INCREASED VOLATILITY BY PLEDGING MORE MONETARY STIMULUS SHOULD THE GLOBAL SLOWDOWN DAMAGE THE U.S. ECONOMY, WHILE SEVERAL CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE GLOBE ALSO RESPONDED, BY CUTTING INTEREST RATES. MOVING INTO SEPTEMBER, VOLATILITY SUBSIDED; THE VIX AND MOVE INDEXES DECLINED, DOMESTIC EQUITIES RECOVERED, AND U.S. TREASURY YIELDS ROSE. THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK CUT ITS SHORT-TERM RATE IN SEPTEMBER, ITS FIRST CUT SINCE 2016, AND LAUNCHED A QUANTITATIVE EASING PROGRAM. LATER IN THE MONTH, THE FEDERAL RESERVE CUT ITS SHORT TERM RATE AGAIN, THOUGH THE DECISION WAS NOT UNANIMOUS, CLOUDING THE OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE REDUCTIONS. THE DJIA, S&P 500, AND NASDAQ EQUITY INDICES POSTED POSITIVE RETURNS FOR THE MONTH, AND MEDIUM-TERM AND LONG-TERM U.S. TREASURY YIELDS ROSE.  PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , OUR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES PORTFOLIO CONSISTED OF  $1.237 BILLION  OF FIXED-RATE AGENCY \"SPECIFIED POOLS,\"  $38.1 MILLION  OF AGENCY RMBS BACKED BY ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES, OR \"AGENCY ARMS,\"  $98.4 MILLION  OF AGENCY REVERSE MORTGAGE POOLS,  $11.6 MILLION  OF AGENCY INTEREST ONLY SECURITIES, OR \"AGENCY IOS,\" AND  $9.2 MILLION  OF NON-AGENCY RMBS. SPECIFIED POOLS ARE FIXED-RATE AGENCY POOLS CONSISTING OF MORTGAGES WITH SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS MORTGAGES WITH LOW LOAN BALANCES, MORTGAGES BACKED BY INVESTOR PROPERTIES, MORTGAGES ORIGINATED THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED \"MAKING HOMES AFFORDABLE\" REFINANCING PROGRAMS, AND MORTGAGES WITH VARIOUS OTHER CHARACTERISTICS.  OUR OVERALL RMBS PORTFOLIO DECREASED BY 4.4% TO  $1.395 BILLION  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO $1.459 BILLION AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  . OUR OVERALL DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO, ADJUSTED FOR UNSETTLED PURCHASES AND SALES, DECREASED TO 8.6:1 AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  FROM 8.9:1 AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  . OUR DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO MAY FLUCTUATE PERIOD OVER PERIOD BASED ON PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DECISIONS, MARKET CONDITIONS, CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES, AND THE TIMING OF SECURITY PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER, OUR NET SHORT TBA POSITION INCREASED; AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD $106.5 MILLION IN NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF LONG TBAS THAT WE HOLD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, AS COMPARED TO $259.2 MILLION AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , AND WE HAD $301.2 MILLION IN NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF SHORT TBAS THAT WE HOLD FOR HEDGING PURPOSES, AS COMPARED TO $332.6 MILLION AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  . AS A RESULT, OUR NET SHORT TBA POSITION INCREASED BY $121.3 MILLION QUARTER OVER QUARTER, AND ALONG WITH THE DECREASE IN OUR OVERALL RMBS PORTFOLIO, OUR NET MORTGAGE ASSETS-TO-EQUITY RATIO\u2014WHICH WE DEFINE AS THE NET AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF OUR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (INCLUDING THE UNDERLYING MARKET VALUES OF OUR LONG AND SHORT TBA POSITIONS) DIVIDED BY TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\u2014DECREASED PERIOD OVER PERIOD TO 7.7:1 AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  FROM 9.0:1 AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  . TBAS ARE FORWARD-SETTLING AGENCY RMBS WHERE THE MORTGAGE PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES TO BE DELIVERED ARE \"TO-BE-ANNOUNCED.\"  DESPITE LARGE FLUCTUATIONS IN LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES, INCREASING PREPAYMENT RATES, AND AN INVERTED YIELD CURVE, WE BENEFITED FROM STRONG PERFORMANCE IN OUR AGENCY RMBS PORTFOLIO DURING THE QUARTER. PAY-UPS ON OUR SPECIFIED POOLS INCREASED FOR THE FOURTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER, AND ALONG WITH DECLINING INTEREST RATES, HELPED GENERATE NET REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS ON OUR PORTFOLIO. PAY-UPS ARE PRICE PREMIUMS FOR SPECIFIED POOLS RELATIVE TO THEIR TBA COUNTERPARTS. SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS QUARTERS, THE DECLINE IN MORTGAGE RATES AND ASSOCIATED INCREASE IN ACTUAL AND PROJECTED PREPAYMENTS DROVE THE EXPANSION OF PAY-UPS. AVERAGE PAY-UPS ON OUR SPECIFIED POOLS INCREASED TO 1.86% AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO 1.56% AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , 0.99% AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, 0.58% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, AND 0.56% AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  DURING THE QUARTER WE CONTINUED TO HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISK, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS, SHORT POSITIONS IN TBAS, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, AND FUTURES. THE DECLINE IN MEDIUM-TERM AND LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES DURING THE QUARTER GENERATED NET REALIZED AND UNREALIZED LOSSES ON OUR INTEREST RATE HEDGES.  WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO TARGET SPECIFIED POOLS THAT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THEIR PARTICULAR COMPOSITION AND BASED ON OUR PREPAYMENT PROJECTIONS, SHOULD: (1) GENERATE ATTRACTIVE YIELDS RELATIVE TO OTHER AGENCY RMBS AND U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, (2) HAVE LESS PREPAYMENT SENSITIVITY TO GOVERNMENT POLICY SHOCKS, AND/OR (3) CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRADING GAINS ONCE THE MARKET  36  RECOGNIZES THEIR VALUE, WHICH FOR NEWER POOLS MAY COME ONLY AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS, WHEN ACTUAL PREPAYMENT EXPERIENCE CAN BE OBSERVED. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESEARCH TEAM, PROPRIETARY PREPAYMENT MODELS, AND EXTENSIVE DATABASES REMAIN ESSENTIAL TOOLS IN OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS STRATEGY.  OUR NON-AGENCY RMBS PERFORMED WELL DURING THE QUARTER, DRIVEN BY STRONG NET INTEREST INCOME AND UNREALIZED GAINS. FUNDAMENTALS UNDERLYING NON-AGENCY RMBS REMAIN STRONG, LED BY A STABLE HOUSING MARKET. OUR TOTAL INVESTMENT IN NON-AGENCY RMBS WAS  $9.2 MILLION  AND $9.3 MILLION AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. TO THE EXTENT THAT MORE ATTRACTIVE ENTRY POINTS DEVELOP IN NON-AGENCY RMBS, WE MAY INCREASE OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION TO THIS SECTOR.

OUR AGENCY RMBS PORTFOLIO TURNOVER WAS 15% FOR THE QUARTER.  DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE CONTINUED TO HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISK, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND SHORT POSITIONS IN TBAS, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, AND FUTURES. FOR THE QUARTER, WE HAD TOTAL NET REALIZED AND UNREALIZED LOSSES OF $(7.8) MILLION, OR $(0.62) PER SHARE, ON OUR INTEREST RATE HEDGING PORTFOLIO, AS INTEREST RATES DECREASED. IN OUR HEDGING PORTFOLIO, THE RELATIVE PROPORTION, BASED ON 10-YEAR EQUIVALENTS, OF NET SHORT POSITIONS IN TBAS INCREASED PERIOD OVER PERIOD RELATIVE TO OUR OTHER INTEREST RATE HEDGES, THEREBY DECREASING OUR OVERALL EXPOSURE TO AGENCY RMBS. 10-YEAR EQUIVALENTS FOR A GROUP OF POSITIONS REPRESENT THE AMOUNT OF 10-YEAR U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED TO EXPERIENCE A SIMILAR CHANGE IN MARKET VALUE UNDER A STANDARD PARALLEL MOVE IN INTEREST RATES. THE RELATIVE MAKEUP OF OUR INTEREST RATE HEDGING PORTFOLIO CAN CHANGE MATERIALLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  38  AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO A THIRD QUARTER DIVIDEND OF $0.28 PER SHARE, OUR BOOK VALUE PER SHARE INCREASED TO $12.42 AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , FROM $12.40 AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , AND WE HAD AN ECONOMIC RETURN OF 2.4% FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . ECONOMIC RETURN IS COMPUTED BY ADDING BACK DIVIDENDS DECLARED TO ENDING BOOK VALUE PER SHARE, AND COMPARING THAT AMOUNT TO BOOK VALUE PER SHARE AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE QUARTER.  OUR NET AGENCY PREMIUM AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SPECIFIED POOL HOLDINGS IS ONE METRIC THAT WE USE TO MEASURE THE OVERALL PREPAYMENT RISK OF OUR SPECIFIED POOL PORTFOLIO. NET AGENCY PREMIUM REPRESENTS THE TOTAL PREMIUM (EXCESS OF MARKET VALUE OVER OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE) ON OUR SPECIFIED POOL HOLDINGS LESS THE TOTAL PREMIUM ON RELATED NET SHORT TBA POSITIONS. THE LOWER OUR NET AGENCY PREMIUM, THE LESS WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SPECIFIED POOL PORTFOLIO IS EXPOSED TO MARKET-WIDE INCREASES IN AGENCY RMBS PREPAYMENTS. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2019  , OUR NET AGENCY PREMIUM AS A PERCENTAGE OF FAIR VALUE OF OUR SPECIFIED POOL HOLDINGS WAS APPROXIMATELY 5.3% AND 5.0%, RESPECTIVELY. EXCLUDING TBA POSITIONS USED TO HEDGE OUR SPECIFIED POOL HOLDINGS, OUR AGENCY PREMIUM AS A PERCENTAGE OF FAIR VALUE WAS APPROXIMATELY 5.9% AND 5.1% AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR AGENCY PREMIUM PERCENTAGE AND NET AGENCY PREMIUM PERCENTAGE MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET FACTORS SUCH AS INTEREST RATES AND MORTGAGE RATES, AND, IN THE CASE OF OUR NET AGENCY PREMIUM PERCENTAGE, BASED ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE HEDGE PREPAYMENT RISK WITH SHORT TBAS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FOCUS ON PURCHASING POOLS WITH SPECIFIC PREPAYMENT CHARACTERISTICS PROVIDES A MEASURE OF PROTECTION AGAINST PREPAYMENTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ADAPTIVE AND ACTIVE STYLE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT IS WELL SUITED TO THE CURRENT MBS MARKET ENVIRONMENT, WHICH CONTINUES TO BE SHAPED BY INTEREST RATE RISK, PREPAYMENT RISK, SHIFTING CENTRAL BANK AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES, REGULATORY CHANGES, AND DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES.  FINANCING  FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , OUR AVERAGE BORROWING COST OF REPO DECLINED TO 2.50% AS COMPARED TO 2.69% FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  . AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING COST ON OUR REPO WAS 2.31%.  WHILE LARGE BANKS STILL DOMINATE THE REPO MARKET, NON-BANK FIRMS, NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME REGULATIONS AS BANKS, ARE ACTIVE IN PROVIDING REPO FINANCING. MOST OF OUR OUTSTANDING REPO FINANCING IS STILL PROVIDED BY BANKS AND BANK AFFILIATES; HOWEVER, WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED INTO REPO AGREEMENTS WITH NON-BANK DEALERS. IN GENERAL, WE CONTINUE TO SEE STRONG APPETITE AND COMPETITIVE TERMS FROM BOTH TYPES OF LENDERS.  OUR DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO WAS 8.7:1 AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO 9.3:1 AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  . ADJUSTED FOR UNSETTLED SECURITY PURCHASES AND SALES, OUR DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO WAS 8.6:1 AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO 8.9:1 AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  . OUR DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO MAY FLUCTUATE PERIOD OVER PERIOD BASED ON PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DECISIONS, MARKET CONDITIONS, CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITIES, AND THE TIMING OF SECURITY PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR UNAUDITED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, OR \"U.S. GAAP.\" ENTITIES IN WHICH WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, THROUGH OWNERSHIP OF THE MAJORITY OF THE ENTITIES' VOTING EQUITY INTERESTS, OR THROUGH OTHER CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS THAT GIVE US CONTROL, ARE CONSOLIDATED BY US. ALL INTER-COMPANY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.  CERTAIN OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. WE BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THE DECISIONS AND ASSESSMENTS UPON WHICH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE BASED WERE REASONABLE AT THE TIME MADE BASED UPON INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US AT THAT TIME. WE RELY ON OUR MANAGER AND ELLINGTON'S EXPERIENCE AND ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL AND CURRENT MARKET DATA IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE ESTIMATES. SEE NOTE 2 OF THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO BE THE FOLLOWING.  VALUATION  : FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE TRADED IN AN \"ACTIVE MARKET,\" THE BEST MEASURE OF FAIR VALUE IS THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE. HOWEVER, MANY OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT TRADED IN AN ACTIVE MARKET. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT GENERALLY USES THIRD-PARTY VALUATIONS WHEN AVAILABLE. IF THIRD-PARTY VALUATIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, MANAGEMENT USES OTHER VALUATION TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. SUMMARY DESCRIPTIONS, FOR THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES MANAGEMENT USES IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE DETAILED IN NOTE 2 OF THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT UTILIZES SUCH METHODOLOGIES TO ASSIGN A GOOD FAITH  39  FAIR VALUE (THE ESTIMATED PRICE THAT, IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION AT THE VALUATION DATE, WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET, OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY, AS THE CASE MAY BE) TO EACH SUCH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.  SEE THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED BY MANAGEMENT IN THE VALUATION OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  ACCOUNTING FOR SECURITIES  : INVESTMENTS IN MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ARE RECORDED ON TRADE DATE. WE HAVE CHOSEN TO MAKE A FAIR VALUE ELECTION PURSUANT TO ASC 825-10,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  , FOR OUR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. ELECTING THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ALLOWS US TO RECORD CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS, WHICH, IN OUR VIEW, MORE APPROPRIATELY REFLECTS THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS FOR A PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD AS ALL SECURITIES ACTIVITIES WILL BE RECORDED IN A SIMILAR MANNER. AS SUCH, THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND THE PERIOD CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE IS RECORDED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AS A COMPONENT OF CHANGE IN NET UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) ON SECURITIES.  REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALES OF MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN NET REALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) ON SECURITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS, AND ARE RECORDED AT THE TIME OF DISPOSITION. THE COST OF POSITIONS SOLD IS CALCULATED BASED ON IDENTIFIED COST. PRINCIPAL WRITE-OFFS ARE GENERALLY TREATED AS REALIZED LOSSES.  INTEREST INCOME  : COUPON INTEREST INCOME ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES IS ACCRUED BASED ON THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE AND THE CURRENT COUPON RATE ON EACH SECURITY. WE AMORTIZE PURCHASE PREMIUMS AND ACCRETE PURCHASE DISCOUNTS ON OUR FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD.  OUR ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS AND AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS ON SECURITIES FOR U.S. FEDERAL AND OTHER TAX PURPOSES IS LIKELY TO DIFFER FROM THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT UNDER U.S. GAAP OF THESE ITEMS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  SEE THE NOTE 2 OF THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS THAT WE USE TO AMORTIZE PURCHASE PREMIUMS AND ACCRETE PURCHASE DISCOUNTS.  INCOME TAXES  : WE MADE AN ELECTION TO BE TAXED AS A REIT FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. AS A REIT, WE GENERALLY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO CORPORATE-LEVEL FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX ON NET INCOME WE DISTRIBUTE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED TIMEFRAMES. TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, WE MUST MEET A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONAL AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING A REQUIREMENT TO DISTRIBUTE AT LEAST 90% OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. EVEN IF WE QUALIFY AS A REIT, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAXES ON OUR INCOME AND PROPERTY, AND TO FEDERAL INCOME AND EXCISE TAXES ON OUR UNDISTRIBUTED TAXABLE INCOME. IF WE FAIL TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR CERTAIN STATUTORY RELIEF PROVISIONS, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES AND MAY BE PRECLUDED FROM QUALIFYING AS A REIT FOR THE FOUR TAXABLE YEARS FOLLOWING THE YEAR IN WHICH WE FAIL TO QUALIFY AS A REIT.  WE FOLLOW THE AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE ON ACCOUNTING FOR AND DISCLOSURE OF UNCERTAINTY ON TAX POSITIONS, WHICH REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER A TAX POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM TAX POSITIONS RELATED TO THE CURRENT PERIOD OR OUR OPEN TAX YEARS. IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, WHERE APPLICABLE, FOR THE CURRENT PERIOD AND OUR OPEN TAX YEARS. WE MAY TAKE POSITIONS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN TAX ISSUES WHICH DEPEND ON LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF FACTS OR APPLICABLE TAX REGULATIONS. SHOULD THE RELEVANT TAX REGULATORS SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGE ANY SUCH POSITIONS; WE MIGHT BE FOUND TO HAVE A TAX LIABILITY THAT HAS NOT BEEN RECORDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALSO, MANAGEMENT'S CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE MAY BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND ADJUSTMENT AT A LATER DATE BASED ON CHANGING TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF. THERE WERE NO AMOUNTS ACCRUED FOR PENALTIES OR INTEREST AS OF OR DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CAPITAL IS ALLOCATED TO OUR AGENCY RMBS STRATEGY, WHICH INCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN AGENCY POOLS AND AGENCY COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS, OR \"CMOS.\" AS OF BOTH  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, INVESTMENTS IN NON-AGENCY RMBS CONSTITUTED A RELATIVELY SMALL PORTION OF OUR TOTAL INVESTMENTS.  OUR MOST PREVALENT METHOD OF FINANCING RMBS IS THROUGH SHORT-TERM REPOS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE MATURITIES OF 180 DAYS OR LESS. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIVES OF THE RMBS THAT WE OWN ARE GENERALLY MUCH LONGER. CONSEQUENTLY, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE TERM OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENT FINANCINGS WILL ALMOST ALWAYS BE SUBSTANTIALLY SHORTER THAN THE EXPECTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR RMBS. THIS MISMATCH IN MATURITIES, TOGETHER WITH THE UNCERTAINTY OF RMBS PREPAYMENTS, AND OTHER POTENTIAL CHANGES IN TIMING AND/OR AMOUNT OF CASH FLOWS ON OUR RMBS ASSETS, CREATES THE RISK THAT CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WILL CAUSE OUR FINANCING COSTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR RMBS TO INCREASE RELATIVE TO THE INCOME ON OUR RMBS OVER THE TERM OF OUR INVESTMENTS.  41  FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR PORTFOLIO OF FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE HOLDINGS AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND DECEMBER 31, 2018.

THESE INTEREST RATE HEDGES GENERALLY SEEK TO REDUCE THE INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY OF OUR LIABILITIES OR, IN OTHER WORDS, REDUCE THE VOLATILITY OF OUR FINANCING COST OVER TIME ATTRIBUTABLE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES. OUR INTEREST RATE HEDGING TRANSACTIONS MAY INCLUDE.  \u2022  INTEREST RATE SWAPS (A CONTRACT EXCHANGING A VARIABLE RATE FOR A FIXED RATE, OR VICE VERSA);  \u2022  INTEREST RATE SWAPTIONS (OPTIONS TO ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS AT A FUTURE DATE);  \u2022  TBA FORWARD CONTRACTS ON AGENCY PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES;  \u2022  SHORT SALES OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES;  \u2022  EURODOLLAR AND U.S. TREASURY FUTURES; AND  \u2022  OTHER DERIVATIVES.  WE GENERALLY ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS TO OFFSET THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS OF RISING INTEREST RATES ON SHORT-TERM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY HAVE MATURITIES OF UP TO 180 DAYS AND CARRY INTEREST RATES THAT ARE DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO LIBOR OR CORRELATED BENCHMARK RATES FOR THOSE SAME PERIODS. AS EACH THEN-EXISTING FIXED-RATE REPO BORROWING MATURES, IT WILL GENERALLY BE REPLACED WITH A NEW FIXED-RATE REPO BORROWING BASED ON MARKET INTEREST RATES ESTABLISHED AT THAT FUTURE DATE.  IN THE CASE OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS, MOST OF OUR AGREEMENTS ARE STRUCTURED SUCH THAT WE RECEIVE PAYMENTS BASED ON A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE AND MAKE PAYMENTS BASED ON A FIXED INTEREST RATE. THE VARIABLE INTEREST RATE ON WHICH PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED IS GENERALLY CALCULATED BASED ON VARIOUS RESET MECHANISMS FOR LIBOR. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR FUTURE REPO BORROWING COSTS CONTINUE TO BE HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH LIBOR, OUR SWAP AGREEMENTS HELP TO REDUCE THE VARIABILITY OF OUR OVERALL REPO BORROWING COSTS, THUS REDUCING RISK TO THE EXTENT WE HOLD FIXED-RATE ASSETS THAT ARE FINANCED WITH REPO BORROWINGS.  IN THE CASE OF TBAS, MOST OF OUR POSITIONS ARE SHORT TBA POSITIONS WITH A NEGATIVE DURATION, MEANING THAT AS INTEREST RATES RISE, THE VALUE OF THE SHORT POSITION INCREASES, SO THESE POSITIONS SERVE AS A HEDGE AGAINST INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES. IN THE EVENT THAT INTEREST RATES RISE, THE INCREASE IN VALUE OF THE SHORT TBA POSITION SERVES TO OFFSET COROLLARY INCREASES IN OUR CURRENT AND/OR FUTURE BORROWING COSTS UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. WHILE WE USE TBAS TO HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISK, WE ALSO HOLD NET LONG POSITIONS IN CERTAIN TBA SECURITIES AS A MEANS OF ACQUIRING EXPOSURE TO AGENCY RMBS.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , AS PART OF OUR INTEREST RATE HEDGING PROGRAM, WE ALSO HELD SHORT POSITIONS IN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, WITH A TOTAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $37.4 MILLION  AND A FAIR VALUE OF  $37.8 MILLION  . AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE ALSO HELD SHORT POSITIONS IN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, WITH A TOTAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $0.4 MILLION  AND A FAIR VALUE OF  $0.4 MILLION.  42  THE COMPOSITION AND RELATIVE MIX OF OUR HEDGING INSTRUMENTS MAY VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF OUR LIABILITIES OUTSTANDING OR ANTICIPATED TO BE ENTERED INTO, THE OVERALL MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND OUR VIEW AS TO WHICH INSTRUMENTS BEST ENABLE US TO EXECUTE OUR HEDGING GOALS.

AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, OUR TOTAL DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO WAS 8.7:1 AND 9.6:1, RESPECTIVELY. COLLATERAL TRANSFERRED WITH RESPECT TO OUR OUTSTANDING REPO BORROWINGS AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND DECEMBER 31, 2018 HAD AN AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF $1.4 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ADJUSTED FOR UNSETTLED SECURITY PURCHASES AND SALES, OUR DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO WAS 8.6:1 AND 9.2:1 AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OUR DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO MAY FLUCTUATE PERIOD OVER PERIOD BASED ON PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DECISIONS, MARKET CONDITIONS, CAPITAL MARKETS CONDITIONS, AND THE TIMING OF SECURITY PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS.  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , OUR SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY INCREASED TO $154.6 MILLION FROM $153.8 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018.

CORE EARNINGS INCLUDES NET REALIZED AND CHANGE IN NET UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) ASSOCIATED WITH PERIODIC SETTLEMENTS ON INTEREST RATE SWAPS. ADJUSTED CORE EARNINGS REPRESENTS CORE EARNINGS EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE CATCH-UP PREMIUM AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT ON INTEREST INCOME. THE \"CATCH-UP PREMIUM AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENT\" IS A QUARTERLY ADJUSTMENT TO PREMIUM AMORTIZATION TRIGGERED BY CHANGES IN ACTUAL AND PROJECTED PREPAYMENTS ON OUR AGENCY RMBS (ACCOMPANIED BY A CORRESPONDING OFFSETTING ADJUSTMENT TO REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES). THE ADJUSTMENT IS CALCULATED AS OF THE BEGINNING OF EACH QUARTER BASED ON OUR THEN-CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CASHFLOWS AND PREPAYMENTS, AND CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER.  CORE EARNINGS AND ADJUSTED CORE EARNINGS ARE SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THAT CORE EARNINGS AND ADJUSTED CORE EARNINGS PROVIDE INFORMATION USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE METRICS THAT WE USE TO ASSESS OUR PERFORMANCE AND TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVE NET YIELD PROVIDED BY THE PORTFOLIO. MOREOVER, ONE OF OUR OBJECTIVES IS TO GENERATE INCOME FROM THE NET INTEREST MARGIN ON THE PORTFOLIO, AND CORE EARNINGS AND ADJUSTED CORE EARNINGS ARE USED TO HELP MEASURE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS OBJECTIVE IS BEING ACHIEVED. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THAT PRESENTING CORE EARNINGS AND ADJUSTED CORE EARNINGS ENABLES OUR INVESTORS TO MEASURE, EVALUATE AND COMPARE OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE TO THAT OF OUR PEER COMPANIES. HOWEVER, BECAUSE CORE EARNINGS AND ADJUSTED CORE EARNINGS ARE INCOMPLETE MEASURES OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND DIFFER FROM NET INCOME (LOSS) COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPLEMENTARY TO, AND NOT AS SUBSTITUTES FOR, NET INCOME (LOSS) COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.  44  THE TABLE BELOW RECONCILES CORE EARNINGS AND ADJUSTED CORE EARNINGS FOR THE THREE- AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND 2018 TO THE LINE, NET INCOME (LOSS), ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE U.S. GAAP MEASURE.

FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , AS MEASURED BY SALES AND EXCLUDING PAYDOWNS, WE TURNED OVER APPROXIMATELY 50% OF OUR AGENCY RMBS PORTFOLIO AND, AS A RESULT OF THESE SALES, WE GENERATED NET REALIZED LOSSES OF $(19.5) MILLION ON OUR AGENCY RMBS PORTFOLIO.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  LIQUIDITY REFERS TO OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR CASH NEEDS, INCLUDING REPAYING OUR BORROWINGS, FUNDING AND MAINTAINING RMBS AND OTHER ASSETS, PAYING DIVIDENDS, AND OTHER GENERAL BUSINESS NEEDS. OUR SHORT-TERM (ONE YEAR OR LESS) AND LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE ACQUISITION COSTS FOR ASSETS WE ACQUIRE, PAYMENT OF OUR MANAGEMENT FEE, COMPLIANCE WITH MARGIN REQUIREMENTS UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, TBA AND OTHER FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, REPAYMENT OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENT BORROWINGS TO THE EXTENT WE ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO EXTEND OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AND PAYMENT OF OUR GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSES. OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CASH ON HAND, CASH FLOW FROM OUR INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING MONTHLY PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS RECEIVED ON OUR RMBS AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF RMBS), BORROWINGS UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND PROCEEDS FROM EQUITY OFFERINGS. WE EXPECT THAT THESE SOURCES OF FUNDS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS.  WE BORROW FUNDS IN THE FORM OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. THE TERMS OF OUR REPO BORROWINGS ARE PREDOMINANTLY GOVERNED BY MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, OR \"MRAS,\" WHICH GENERALLY CONFORM TO THE TERMS IN THE STANDARD MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENT AS PUBLISHED BY THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY AND FINANCIAL MARKETS ASSOCIATION AS TO REPAYMENT AND MARGIN REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, EACH LENDER MAY REQUIRE THAT WE INCLUDE SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS TO THE STANDARD MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENT. TYPICAL SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS INCLUDE THE ADDITION OF OR CHANGES TO PROVISIONS RELATING TO MARGIN CALLS, NET ASSET VALUE REQUIREMENTS, CROSS DEFAULT PROVISIONS, CERTAIN KEY PERSON EVENTS, CHANGES IN CORPORATE STRUCTURE, AND REQUIREMENTS THAT ALL CONTROVERSIES RELATED TO THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT BE LITIGATED IN A PARTICULAR JURISDICTION. THESE PROVISIONS MAY DIFFER FOR EACH OF OUR LENDERS.  49  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAD  $1.3 BILLION  AND $1.5 BILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , OUR OUTSTANDING REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WERE WITH  14  COUNTERPARTIES.  THE AMOUNTS BORROWED UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO THE APPLICATION OF \"HAIRCUTS.\" A HAIRCUT IS THE PERCENTAGE DISCOUNT THAT A REPO LENDER APPLIES TO THE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET SERVING AS COLLATERAL FOR A REPO BORROWING, FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING WHETHER SUCH REPO BORROWING IS ADEQUATELY COLLATERALIZED. AS OF BOTH  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE CONTRACTUAL HAIRCUT APPLICABLE TO THE ASSETS THAT SERVE AS COLLATERAL FOR OUR OUTSTANDING REPO BORROWINGS WAS 5.1%.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE DETAILS TOTAL OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS, AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS, AND THE MAXIMUM OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AT ANY MONTH END FOR EACH QUARTER UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS FOR THE PAST TWELVE QUARTERS.  QUARTER ENDED  BORROWINGS  OUTSTANDING AT  QUARTER END  AVERAGE  BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING  MAXIMUM BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AT ANY MONTH END  (IN THOUSANDS)  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  $1,337,984  $1,369,722  $1,374,080  JUNE 30, 2019  1,442,043  1,412,434  1,442,043  MARCH 31, 2019  1,427,147  1,422,333  1,427,147  DECEMBER 31, 2018  1,481,561  1,456,905  1,481,561  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  1,500,632  1,506,855  1,515,617  JUNE 30, 2018  1,537,216  1,530,734  1,537,216  MARCH 31, 2018  1,589,319  1,588,515  1,590,790  DECEMBER 31, 2017  1,597,206  1,614,096  1,643,683  SEPTEMBER 30, 2017  1,642,313  1,633,746  1,650,729  JUNE 30, 2017  (1)  1,628,450  1,339,806  1,628,450  MARCH 31, 2017  1,178,285  1,194,321  1,199,860  DECEMBER 31, 2016  1,197,973  1,170,091  1,197,973  (1)  FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2017, THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE BETWEEN AVERAGE BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AND TOTAL BORROWINGS AS OF JUNE 30, 2017 WAS THE RESULT OF OUR DEPLOYMENT OF THE PROCEEDS FROM OUR FOLLOW-ON OFFERING OF COMMON SHARES DURING THE QUARTER. BASED ON OUR HIGHER EQUITY BASE, WE INCREASED OUR REPO BORROWINGS SO AS TO MAINTAIN OUR DESIRED DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT AT RISK UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH 14 COUNTERPARTIES OF $73.0 MILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAD AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT AT RISK UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH 12 COUNTERPARTIES OF $89.6 MILLION. AMOUNTS AT RISK REPRESENT THE EXCESS, IF ANY, FOR EACH COUNTERPARTY OF THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL HELD BY SUCH COUNTERPARTY OVER THE AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. IF THE AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY ARE GREATER THAN THE COLLATERAL HELD BY THE COUNTERPARTY, THERE IS NO AMOUNT AT RISK FOR THE PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY. AMOUNTS AT RISK UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND DECEMBER 31, 2018 DOES NOT INCLUDE $0.6 MILLION AND $0.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF NET ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE, WHICH IS DEFINED AS ACCRUED INTEREST ON SECURITIES HELD AS COLLATERAL LESS INTEREST PAYABLE ON CASH BORROWED.  OUR DERIVATIVES ARE PREDOMINANTLY SUBJECT TO BILATERAL COLLATERAL ARRANGEMENTS OR CLEARING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DODD-FRANK ACT. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO DELIVER OR RECEIVE CASH OR SECURITIES AS COLLATERAL UPON ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUE OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS MAY REQUIRE US OR THE COUNTERPARTY TO POST OR RECEIVE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL. ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS INVOLVES MARKET RISK IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS RECORDED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. IN THE CASE OF CLEARED DERIVATIVES, THE CLEARINGHOUSE BECOMES OUR COUNTERPARTY AND THE FUTURE COMMISSION MERCHANT ACTS AS AN INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN US AND THE CLEARINGHOUSE WITH RESPECT TO ALL FACETS OF THE RELATED TRANSACTION, INCLUDING THE POSTING AND RECEIPT OF REQUIRED COLLATERAL.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT AT RISK UNDER OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, EXCLUDING TBAS, WITH THREE COUNTERPARTIES OF APPROXIMATELY $11.6 MILLION. WE ALSO HAD $10.0 MILLION OF INITIAL MARGIN FOR CLEARED OVER-THE-COUNTER, OR \"OTC,\" DERIVATIVES POSTED TO CENTRAL CLEARINGHOUSES AS OF THAT DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAD AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT AT RISK UNDER OUR DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS, EXCLUDING TBAS, WITH THREE COUNTERPARTIES OF APPROXIMATELY $11.6 MILLION. WE ALSO HAD $9.8 MILLION OF INITIAL MARGIN FOR CLEARED OTC DERIVATIVES POSTED TO CENTRAL CLEARINGHOUSES AS OF THAT DATE. AMOUNTS AT RISK UNDER OUR DERIVATIVES CONTRACTS REPRESENT THE EXCESS, IF ANY, FOR EACH COUNTERPARTY OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS PLUS OUR COLLATERAL HELD DIRECTLY BY THE COUNTERPARTY LESS THE COUNTERPARTY'S COLLATERAL HELD BY US. IF A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY'S COLLATERAL HELD BY US IS GREATER THAN THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF THE FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES PLUS OUR COLLATERAL HELD DIRECTLY BY THE  50  COUNTERPARTY, THERE IS NO AMOUNT AT RISK FOR THE PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY.  WE PURCHASE AND SELL TBAS AND AGENCY PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES ON A WHEN-ISSUED OR DELAYED DELIVERY BASIS. THE DELAYED DELIVERY FOR THESE SECURITIES MEANS THAT THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE MORE PRONE TO MARKET FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE TRADE DATE AND THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT DATE, AND THEREFORE ARE MORE VULNERABLE, ESPECIALLY IN THE ABSENCE OF MARGINING ARRANGEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THESE TRANSACTIONS, TO INCREASING AMOUNTS AT RISK WITH THE APPLICABLE COUNTERPARTIES. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , IN CONNECTION WITH OUR FORWARD SETTLING TBA AND AGENCY PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES, WE HAD AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT AT RISK WITH 11 COUNTERPARTIES OF APPROXIMATELY $3.9 MILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, IN CONNECTION WITH OUR FORWARD SETTLING TBA AND AGENCY PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES, WE HAD AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT AT RISK WITH EIGHT COUNTERPARTIES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.5 MILLION. AMOUNTS AT RISK IN CONNECTION WITH OUR FORWARD SETTLING TBA AND AGENCY PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES REPRESENT THE EXCESS, IF ANY, FOR EACH COUNTERPARTY OF THE NET FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD SETTLING SECURITIES PLUS OUR COLLATERAL HELD DIRECTLY BY THE COUNTERPARTY LESS THE COUNTERPARTY'S COLLATERAL HELD BY US. IF A PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY'S COLLATERAL HELD BY US IS GREATER THAN THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD SETTLING SECURITIES PLUS OUR COLLATERAL HELD DIRECTLY BY THE COUNTERPARTY, THERE IS NO AMOUNT AT RISK FOR THE PARTICULAR COUNTERPARTY.  WE HELD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $50.2 MILLION  AND $18.6 MILLION AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  WE MAY DECLARE DIVIDENDS BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR EARNINGS, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, THE REIT QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED, OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES. THE DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DIVIDENDS ARE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES.

OUR REPO ACTIVITY USED TO FINANCE OUR PURCHASE OF SECURITIES (INCLUDING REPAYMENTS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SALES OF SECURITIES, OF AMOUNTS BORROWED UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS COLLATERAL POSTED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR REPO ACTIVITY) USED NET CASH OF  $162.2 MILLION  . THUS OUR OPERATING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES, WHEN COMBINED WITH OUR NET REPO FINANCING ACTIVITIES, PROVIDED NET CASH OF  $44.3 MILLION  . WE USED  $12.0 MILLION  TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND $0.7 MILLION TO REPURCHASE COMMON SHARES. AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIVITIES, THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN OUR CASH HOLDINGS OF  $31.6 MILLION  , FROM $18.6 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO  $50.2 MILLION  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED NET CASH OF $22.2 MILLION AND OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED NET CASH OF $87.6 MILLION. OUR REPO ACTIVITY USED TO FINANCE OUR PURCHASE OF SECURITIES (INCLUDING REPAYMENTS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SALES OF SECURITIES, OF AMOUNTS BORROWED UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS COLLATERAL POSTED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR REPO ACTIVITY) USED NET CASH OF $103.2 MILLION. THUS OUR OPERATING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES, WHEN COMBINED WITH OUR NET REPO FINANCING ACTIVITIES, PROVIDED NET CASH OF $6.5 MILLION. WE USED $14.4 MILLION TO PAY DIVIDENDS AND $7.3 MILLION TO REPURCHASE COMMON SHARES. AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIVITIES, THERE WAS A DECREASE IN OUR CASH HOLDINGS OF $15.1 MILLION, FROM $56.1 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 TO $41.0 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  ON JUNE 13, 2018, OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES APPROVED THE ADOPTION OF A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM UNDER WHICH WE ARE AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO 1.2 MILLION COMMON SHARES. THE PROGRAM, WHICH IS OPEN-ENDED IN DURATION, ALLOWS US TO MAKE  51  REPURCHASES FROM TIME TO TIME ON THE OPEN MARKET OR IN NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH RULE 10B5-1 PLANS. REPURCHASES ARE AT OUR DISCRETION, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, SHARE AVAILABILITY, PRICE AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AMONG OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. THIS PROGRAM SUPERSEDED THE PROGRAM THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED ON FEBRUARY 6, 2018. DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE REPURCHASED  33,706  COMMON SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF  $9.87  AND A TOTAL COST OF  $0.3 MILLION  . DURING THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE REPURCHASED  73,816  COMMON SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF  $10.12  AND A TOTAL COST OF  $0.7 MILLION  . UNDER THE CURRENT REPURCHASE PROGRAM ADOPTED ON JUNE 13, 2018, WE HAVE REPURCHASED 298,029 COMMON SHARES THROUGH NOVEMBER 1, 2019 FOR AN AGGREGATE COST OF $3.1 MILLION, AND HAVE AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL 901,971 COMMON SHARES.  BASED ON OUR CURRENT PORTFOLIO, AMOUNT OF FREE CASH ON HAND, DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO AND CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE US TO MEET ANTICIPATED SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS.  WE ARE NOT REQUIRED BY OUR INVESTMENT GUIDELINES TO MAINTAIN ANY SPECIFIC DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPROPRIATE LEVERAGE FOR THE PARTICULAR ASSETS WE HOLD DEPENDS ON THE CREDIT QUALITY AND RISK OF THOSE ASSETS, AS WELL AS THE GENERAL AVAILABILITY AND TERMS OF STABLE AND RELIABLE FINANCING FOR THOSE ASSETS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  WE ARE A PARTY TO A MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR MANAGER. PURSUANT TO THAT AGREEMENT, OUR MANAGER IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A MANAGEMENT FEE BASED ON SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, REIMBURSEMENT OF CERTAIN EXPENSES AND, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A TERMINATION FEE. SUCH FEES AND EXPENSES DO NOT HAVE FIXED AND DETERMINABLE PAYMENTS. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT PROVISIONS, SEE NOTE 9 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE ENTER INTO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY BROKER-DEALERS WHEREBY WE SELL SECURITIES TO SUCH BROKER-DEALERS AT AGREED-UPON PURCHASE PRICES AT THE INITIATION OF THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND AGREE TO REPURCHASE SUCH SECURITIES AT PREDETERMINED REPURCHASE PRICES AND TERMINATION DATES, THUS PROVIDING THE BROKER-DEALERS WITH AN IMPLIED INTEREST RATE ON THE FUNDS INITIALLY TRANSFERRED TO US BY THE BROKER-DEALERS. WE MAY ENTER INTO REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY BROKER-DEALERS WHEREBY WE PURCHASE SECURITIES UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL AT AN AGREED-UPON PRICE AND DATE. IN GENERAL, WE MOST OFTEN WILL ENTER INTO REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT TRANSACTIONS IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY BORROW SECURITIES THAT WE CAN THEN DELIVER TO COUNTERPARTIES TO WHOM WE HAVE MADE SHORT SALES OF THE SAME SECURITIES. THE IMPLIED INTEREST RATES ON THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WE ENTER INTO ARE BASED UPON COMPETITIVE MARKET RATES AT THE TIME OF INITIATION. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE CONDUCTED WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY MAY BE REPORTED ON A NET BASIS IF THEY MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF ASC 210-20,  BALANCE SHEET, OFFSETTING  . AS OF BOTH  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, THERE WERE NO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS REPORTED ON A NET BASIS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD  $1.3 BILLION  OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS WITH  14  COUNTERPARTIES.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS STRUCTURED FINANCE OR SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES. FURTHER, WE HAVE NOT GUARANTEED ANY OBLIGATIONS OF UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES NOR DO WE HAVE ANY COMMITMENT OR INTENT TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO ANY SUCH ENTITIES. AS SUCH, WE ARE NOT MATERIALLY EXPOSED TO ANY MARKET, CREDIT, LIQUIDITY, OR FINANCING RISK THAT COULD ARISE IF WE HAD ENGAGED IN SUCH RELATIONSHIPS.  INFLATION  VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE IN NATURE. AS A RESULT, INTEREST RATES AND OTHER FACTORS INFLUENCE OUR PERFORMANCE FAR MORE SO THAN DOES INFLATION.

ON JULY 29, 2019, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF FIRST DATA CORPORATION FOR A TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY  $46.5 BILLION  BY ACQUIRING  100%  OF THE FIRST DATA STOCK THAT WAS ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING AS OF THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION, FIRST DATA STOCKHOLDERS RECEIVED  286 MILLION  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF FISERV, INC., USING AN EXCHANGE RATIO OF  0.303  SHARES OF FISERV, INC. FOR EACH SHARE OF FIRST DATA COMMON STOCK, WITH CASH PAID IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES. WE ALSO CONVERTED APPROXIMATELY  15 MILLION  OUTSTANDING FIRST DATA EQUITY AWARDS INTO CORRESPONDING EQUITY AWARDS RELATING TO COMMON STOCK OF FISERV, INC. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXCHANGE RATIO. IN ADDITION, CONCURRENT WITH THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION, WE MADE A CASH PAYMENT OF APPROXIMATELY  $16.4 BILLION  TO REPAY EXISTING FIRST DATA DEBT. WE FUNDED THE TRANSACTION-RELATED EXPENSES AND THE REPAYMENT OF FIRST DATA DEBT THROUGH A COMBINATION OF AVAILABLE CASH ON-HAND, PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF SENIOR NOTES AND TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BORROWINGS. THE ACQUISITION OF FIRST DATA ENHANCES OUR POSITION AS A GLOBAL PAYMENTS AND FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY PROVIDER BY EXPANDING THE PORTFOLIO OF SERVICES PROVIDED TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, CORPORATE AND MERCHANT CLIENTS AND CONSUMERS.  ON OCTOBER 31, 2018, WE ACQUIRED THE DEBIT CARD PROCESSING, ATM MANAGED SERVICES, AND MONEY PASS  \u00ae  SURCHARGE-FREE NETWORK OF ELAN FINANCIAL SERVICES, A UNIT OF U.S. BANCORP, FOR APPROXIMATELY  $659 MILLION  , INCLUDING POST-CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS, ESTIMATED CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO EARN-OUT PROVISIONS AND FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER A TRANSITION SERVICES  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AGREEMENT IN EXCESS OF ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. THIS ACQUISITION, INCLUDED WITHIN THE PAYMENTS SEGMENT, DEEPENS OUR PRESENCE IN DEBIT CARD PROCESSING, BROADENS OUR CLIENT REACH AND SCALE, AND PROVIDES NEW SOLUTIONS TO ENHANCE THE VALUE PROPOSITION FOR OUR EXISTING DEBIT SOLUTION CLIENTS.  IN MARCH 2018, WE SOLD A  55%  INTEREST OF OUR LENDING SOLUTIONS BUSINESS, WHICH WAS REPORTED WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SEGMENT, RETAINING  45%  OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN TWO JOINT VENTURES (THE \u201cLENDING JOINT VENTURES\u201d). IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS TRANSACTION, WE ENTERED INTO TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE, AT FAIR VALUE, VARIOUS ADMINISTRATION, BUSINESS PROCESS OUTSOURCING, TECHNICAL AND DATA CENTER RELATED SERVICES FOR DEFINED PERIODS TO THE LENDING JOINT VENTURES. WE RECEIVED GROSS SALE PROCEEDS OF  $419 MILLION  FROM THE TRANSACTIONS. IN AUGUST 2019, THE SAGENT AUTO, LLC, FORMERLY KNOWN AS FISERV AUTOMOTIVE SOLUTIONS, LLC, JOINT VENTURE COMPLETED A MERGER WITH A THIRD-PARTY, RESULTING IN THE DILUTION OF OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST TO 31% IN THE NEW, COMBINED ENTITY.  ENTERPRISE PRIORITIES  WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT A SERIES OF STRATEGIC INITIATIVES TO MOVE MONEY AND INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT MOVES THE WORLD. THESE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES INCLUDE ACTIVE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT OF OUR BUSINESSES, ENHANCING THE OVERALL VALUE OF OUR EXISTING CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS, IMPROVING OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS, BEING DISCIPLINED IN OUR ALLOCATION OF CAPITAL, AND DIFFERENTIATING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH INNOVATION. OUR KEY ENTERPRISE PRIORITIES FOR  2019  HAVE BEEN EXPANDED TO NOW INCLUDE DELIVERING INTEGRATION VALUE FROM THE FIRST DATA ACQUISITION, WHILE MAINTAINING OUR ORIGINAL PRIORITIES TO: (I) CONTINUE TO BUILD HIGH-QUALITY REVENUE WHILE MEETING OUR EARNINGS GOALS; (II) ENHANCE CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON DIGITAL AND PAYMENT SOLUTIONS; AND (III) DELIVER INNOVATION AND INTEGRATION WHICH ENABLES DIFFERENTIATED VALUE FOR OUR CLIENTS. WE WILL ALSO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO INTEGRATING FIRST DATA INTO OUR OPERATIONS.  INDUSTRY TRENDS  THE GLOBAL PAYMENTS LANDSCAPE CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, WITH RAPIDLY ADVANCING TECHNOLOGIES AND A STEADY EXPANSION OF DIGITAL PAYMENTS, ECOMMERCE, AND INNOVATION IN REAL-TIME PAYMENTS INFRASTRUCTURE. BECAUSE OF THIS GROWTH, COMPETITION ALSO CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. BUSINESS AND CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS CONTINUE TO RISE, WITH A FOCUS ON CONVENIENCE AND SECURITY. TO MEET THESE EXPECTATIONS, PAYMENTS COMPANIES ARE FOCUSED ON MODERNIZING THEIR TECHNOLOGY, UTILIZING DATA, AND ENHANCING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.  FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  THE MARKET FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CONTINUES TO EVOLVE RAPIDLY. THE TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL INDUSTRY AND OTHER MARKET ENTRANTS REGULARLY INTRODUCE AND IMPLEMENT NEW PAYMENT, DEPOSIT, RISK MANAGEMENT, LENDING, AND INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, AND THE DISTINCTIONS AMONG THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TRADITIONALLY OFFERED BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CONTINUE TO NARROW AS THEY SEEK TO SERVE THE SAME CUSTOMERS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE EVOLVING REGULATORY AND CYBERSECURITY LANDSCAPE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD HAS CONTINUED TO CREATE A CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THESE CONDITIONS ARE DRIVING HEIGHTENED INTEREST IN SOLUTIONS THAT HELP FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WIN AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS, GENERATE INCREMENTAL REVENUE, COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS AND ENHANCE OPERATING EFFICIENCY. EXAMPLES OF THESE SOLUTIONS INCLUDE ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS AND DELIVERY METHODS SUCH AS INTERNET, MOBILE AND TABLET BANKING, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS \u201cDIGITAL CHANNELS.\u201d  THE FOCUS ON DIGITAL CHANNELS BY BOTH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS THE GROWING VOLUME AND TYPES OF PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS IN THE MARKETPLACE, CONTINUES TO ELEVATE THE DATA AND TRANSACTION PROCESSING NEEDS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WE EXPECT THAT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS, MANAGE INFORMATION, MAINTAIN REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND OFFER INNOVATIVE NEW SERVICES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS IN THIS RAPIDLY EVOLVING AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL BENEFIT OVER THE LONG TERM FROM THE TREND OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MOVING FROM IN-HOUSE TECHNOLOGY TO OUTSOURCED SOLUTIONS AS THEY SEEK TO REMAIN CURRENT ON TECHNOLOGY CHANGES IN AN EVOLVING MARKETPLACE. WE BELIEVE THAT ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING THE INFRASTRUCTURE, TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND NETWORKS NECESSARY TO BE COMPETITIVE IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT ARE ESSENTIAL TO JUSTIFY THESE INVESTMENTS, AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS THAT FACILITATE CUSTOMER INTERACTION WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS THROUGH DIGITAL CHANNELS, WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE, WHICH WE EXPECT TO CREATE REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US.  IN ADDITION TO THE TRENDS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MARKETPLACE HAS EXPERIENCED CHANGE IN COMPOSITION AS WELL. DURING THE PAST 25 YEARS, THE NUMBER OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS DECLINED AT A RELATIVELY STEADY RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 3% PER YEAR, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF VOLUNTARY MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. RATHER THAN REDUCING THE OVERALL MARKET, THESE CONSOLIDATIONS HAVE TRANSFERRED ACCOUNTS AMONG FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IF A CLIENT LOSS OCCURS DUE TO MERGER OR ACQUISITION, WE RECEIVE A CONTRACT TERMINATION FEE BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE CLIENT AND HOW EARLY IN THE CONTRACT TERM THE CONTRACT IS TERMINATED. THESE FEES CAN VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. OUR FOCUS ON LONG-TERM CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND RECURRING, TRANSACTION-ORIENTED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAS ALSO REDUCED THE IMPACT THAT CONSOLIDATION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS HAD ON US.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTEGRATION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CREATES A COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITION FOR OUR CLIENTS BY PROVIDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, NEW SOURCES OF REVENUE AND OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE THEIR COSTS. FURTHERMORE, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SIZABLE AND DIVERSE CLIENT BASE, COMBINED WITH OUR POSITION AS A LEADING PROVIDER OF NON-DISCRETIONARY, RECURRING REVENUE-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, GIVES US A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH.  MERCHANTS  IN THE MERCHANT SPACE, THE RAPID GROWTH IN AND GLOBALIZATION OF MOBILE AND ECOMMERCE, DRIVEN BY CONSUMERS\u2019 DESIRE FOR SIMPLER, MORE EFFICIENT SHOPPING EXPERIENCES, HAS CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MERCHANTS TO REACH CONSUMERS IN HIGH-GROWTH ONLINE AND MOBILE SETTINGS, WHICH OFTEN REQUIRES A MERCHANT ACQUIRING PROVIDER TO ENABLE AND OPTIMIZE THE ACCEPTANCE OF PAYMENTS. MERCHANTS ARE DEMANDING SIMPLER, INTEGRATED, AND MODERN POS SYSTEMS TO HELP MANAGE THEIR EVERYDAY BUSINESS OPERATIONS. WHEN COMBINED WITH THE EVER-INCREASING WAYS A CONSUMER CAN PAY FOR GOODS AND SERVICES, MERCHANTS HAVE SOUGHT MODERN POS SYSTEMS TO STREAMLINE THIS COMPLEXITY. FURTHERMORE, MERCHANTS CAN NOW SEARCH, DISCOVER, COMPARE, PURCHASE, AND EVEN INSTALL A NEW POS SYSTEM THROUGH DIRECT, DIGITAL-ONLY EXPERIENCES. THIS DIRECT, DIGITAL-ONLY CHANNEL IS QUICKLY BECOMING A NOTABLE SOURCE OF NEW MERCHANT ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES, ESPECIALLY SMALLER MERCHANTS WITH SIMPLER SOLUTION NEEDS, AND WE BELIEVE THAT OUR DIGITAL MERCHANT ACQUISITION SOLUTION IS ONE OF THE FEW SUCH SOLUTIONS IN THE INDUSTRY.  ADDITIONALLY, THERE ARE NUMEROUS SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (\u201cSAAS\u201d) SOLUTIONS IN THE INDUSTRY, MANY OF WHICH HAVE CHOSEN TO INTEGRATE MERCHANT ACQUIRING WITHIN THEIR SOFTWARE IN A WAY TO FURTHER MONETIZE THEIR CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS. SAAS SOLUTIONS THAT INTEGRATE PAYMENTS ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS, OR ISVS, AND WE BELIEVE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THESE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION PARTNERSHIPS AVAILABLE.  CHANGES IN CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES. IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE IDENTIFIED OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES THAT WE USE TO PREPARE OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING FOR RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, AND BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE IN LIGHT OF CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL AMOUNTS AND RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES. THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES FROM THOSE DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , EXCEPT FOR THE FOLLOWING AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF FIRST DATA.  RESERVE FOR MERCHANT CREDIT LOSSES  OUR MERCHANT CLIENTS ASSUME THE LIABILITY FOR ANY CHARGES PROPERLY REVERSED BY THE CARDHOLDER. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO COLLECT SUCH AMOUNTS FROM THE MERCHANTS DUE TO MERCHANT FRAUD, INSOLVENCY, BANKRUPTCY OR ANOTHER REASON, WE MAY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SUCH REVERSED CHARGES. OUR RISK IN THIS AREA PRIMARILY RELATES TO SITUATIONS WHERE THE CARDHOLDER HAS PURCHASED GOODS OR SERVICES TO BE DELIVERED IN THE FUTURE AND WHICH HAVE YET TO BE DELIVERED. WE REQUIRE CASH DEPOSITS, GUARANTEES, LETTERS OF CREDIT OR OTHER TYPES OF COLLATERAL FROM CERTAIN MERCHANTS TO MINIMIZE THIS OBLIGATION. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT COLLATERAL IS INCLUDED WITHIN SETTLEMENT ASSETS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE AMOUNTS OF COLLATERAL HELD WAS  $510 MILLION  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . WE ALSO UTILIZE A NUMBER OF SYSTEMS AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE MERCHANT RISK. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE SOME LEVEL OF LOSSES DUE TO MERCHANT DEFAULTS. THE AGGREGATE MERCHANT CREDIT LOSSES INCURRED WAS  $17 MILLION  FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  OUR RESERVE RELATES TO IMPRECISION IN OUR ESTIMATES OF REQUIRED COLLATERAL, WHICH IS RECORDED BASED PRIMARILY ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF CREDIT LOSSES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS SUCH AS ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS OR INCREASES IN MERCHANT FRAUD. THE RESERVE RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET RELATES TO THE BUSINESS CONDUCTED BY OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES. THE RESERVE FOR UNCONSOLIDATED ALLIANCES IS RECORDED ONLY IN THE ALLIANCES\u2019 RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE HAVE NOT RECORDED ANY RESERVE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES IN EXCESS OF RESERVES RECORDED BY THE UNCONSOLIDATED ALLIANCES NOR HAVE WE IDENTIFIED NEEDS TO DO SO. THE AGGREGATE MERCHANT CREDIT LOSS RESERVE RECORDED WAS  $35 MILLION  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THE CREDIT LOSS RESERVES ARE COMPRISED OF AMOUNTS FOR KNOWN LOSSES AND A PROVISION FOR LOSSES INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED. THESE RESERVES PRIMARILY ARE DETERMINED BY PERFORMING A HISTORICAL ANALYSIS OF CHARGEBACK LOSS EXPERIENCE. OTHER FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED THAT COULD AFFECT THAT EXPERIENCE IN THE FUTURE. SUCH ITEMS INCLUDE THE GENERAL ECONOMY AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES IN A SPECIFIC INDUSTRY OR THOSE AFFECTING CERTAIN TYPES OF CLIENTS. ONCE THESE FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED, WE ESTABLISH A RATE (PERCENTAGE) THAT IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE EXPECTED CHARGEBACK (CREDIT) LOSSES BY DOLLAR VOLUME PROCESSED. THIS RATE IS THEN APPLIED AGAINST THE DOLLAR VOLUME PROCESSED EACH MONTH AND CHARGED AGAINST EARNINGS. THE RESULTING RESERVE BALANCE IS THEN COMPARED TO REQUIREMENTS FOR KNOWN LOSSES AND ESTIMATES FOR INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED ITEMS.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INCOME TAXES  THE DETERMINATION OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT IN THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX LAWS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY\u2019S INCREASED GLOBAL FOOTPRINT. JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE TIMING AND AMOUNTS OF DEDUCTIBLE AND TAXABLE ITEMS. WE ESTABLISH A LIABILITY FOR KNOWN TAX EXPOSURES RELATING TO DEDUCTIONS, TRANSACTIONS, AND OTHER MATTERS INVOLVING SOME UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE PROPER TAX TREATMENT OF THE ITEM. IN ESTABLISHING A LIABILITY FOR KNOWN TAX EXPOSURES, ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE IN DETERMINING WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, A TAX POSITION SHOULD BE SUSTAINED. A TAX POSITION IS RECOGNIZED ONLY WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE RELEVANT TAX AUTHORITY, BASED ON ITS TECHNICAL MERITS. THE AMOUNT OF TAX BENEFIT RECOGNIZED IS THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT WE BELIEVE IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED ON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, WE EVALUATE OUR TAX POSITIONS AND ADJUST OUR LIABILITY FOR KNOWN TAX EXPOSURES AS APPROPRIATE.  FIRST DATA HAS HISTORICALLY GENERATED TAX NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS IN VARIOUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS, RESULTING IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. WE ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN, BASED UPON THE WEIGHT OF ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, WE BELIEVE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. WE BELIEVE THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED BECAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE OF SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME WITHIN THE CARRYFORWARD PERIOD AVAILABLE UNDER THE TAX LAW, BUT HAVE ESTABLISHED VALUATION ALLOWANCES FOR THOSE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT IN OUR JUDGMENT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. IN MAKING THIS DETERMINATION, WE HAVE CONSIDERED THE RELATIVE IMPACT OF ALL OF THE AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCES REGARDING FUTURE SOURCES OF TAXABLE INCOME AND AVAILABLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, THERE COULD BE MATERIAL IMPACT TO OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN OUR JUDGMENT. IF AND WHEN OUR JUDGMENT CHANGES, THEN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ADJUSTED GENERALLY THROUGH THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THIS DETERMINATION IS MADE.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS CERTAIN AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, THE RELATIVE PERCENTAGE THAT THOSE AMOUNTS REPRESENT TO REVENUE AND THE CHANGE IN THOSE AMOUNTS FROM YEAR TO YEAR.

THE INCREASE IN BOTH THE THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE INCREMENTAL REVENUE FROM THE FIRST DATA ACQUISITION, WHICH CONTRIBUTED $1,614 MILLION OF REVENUE TO EACH PERIOD.  REVENUE IN OUR PAYMENTS SEGMENT  INCREASED  $82 MILLION  , OR  10%  , DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF 2019 AND  $234 MILLION  , OR  9%  , DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF  2019  COMPARED TO 2018. REVENUE FROM THE ACQUIRED ELAN BUSINESS CONTRIBUTED 5% TO PAYMENTS SEGMENT REVENUE GROWTH IN BOTH THE THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF  2019  .

FINANCIAL SEGMENT REVENUE GROWTH IN 2019 WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN OUR BANK SOLUTIONS BUSINESS FROM NEW BUSINESS, CUSTOMER MIGRATIONS FROM IN-HOUSE TECHNOLOGY TO OUTSOURCED SOLUTIONS AND GROWTH WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS ACROSS A RANGE OF PRODUCTS. THIS GROWTH WAS OFFSET IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 FROM THE DISPOSITION OF A 55% INTEREST OF OUR LENDING SOLUTIONS BUSINESS IN LATE MARCH 2018, WHICH REDUCED FINANCIAL SEGMENT REVENUE BY 3%.

TOTAL EXPENSES IN 2019 INCLUDE THE EXPENSES FOR FIRST DATA SINCE THE ACQUISITION DATE, RESULTING IN THE OVERALL SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN EXPENSES COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR PERIODS.  COST OF PROCESSING AND SERVICES AS A PERCENTAGE OF PROCESSING AND SERVICES REVENUE  DECREASED  TO  46.2%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  46.4%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2018  AND  INCREASED  TO  46.8%  IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED TO  46.2%  IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018. COST OF PROCESSING AND SERVICES AS A PERCENTAGE OF PROCESSING AND SERVICES REVENUE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 90 BASIS POINTS FROM OUR FIRST DATA ACQUISITION AND APPROXIMATELY 50 BASIS POINTS FROM A REDUCTION IN CLIENT-FOCUSED INCREMENTAL INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 80 BASIS POINTS FROM OUR ELAN ACQUISITION AND APPROXIMATELY 50 BASIS POINTS FROM EXPENSES SHIFTING FROM COST OF PRODUCT TO COST OF PROCESSING AND SERVICES AS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CONTINUE TO MOVE FROM IN-HOUSE TECHNOLOGY TO OUTSOURCED SOLUTIONS.

A PORTION OF THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SENIOR NOTE OFFERINGS DESCRIBED ABOVE WAS USED IN JUNE 2019 TO REPAY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS TOTALING  $790 MILLION  UNDER OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.

(3)  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EARLY REDEMPTION OF BROKERED TIME DEPOSITS TOTALED $215,000, AND INCREASED THE COST OF FUNDS BY 13 BASIS POINTS.  FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT BASIS NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED $5,075,000 FROM 2018. THE INCREASE REFLECTED A CHANGING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT WITH INCREASED AVERAGE INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS BALANCES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER AVERAGE BALANCE OF INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES. THE FOMC INCREASED THE FED FUNDS TARGET RATE 25 BASIS POINTS IN BOTH SEPTEMBER AND DECEMBER, 2018, AND DECREASED IT 25 BASIS POINTS IN BOTH JULY AND SEPTEMBER, 2019.  TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON LOANS INCREASED $7,750,000 YEAR-OVER-YEAR.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A NET $9,000,000 REDUCTION IN LOANS OUTSTANDING DUE TO REPAYMENTS TOTALING $16,000,000 FROM THE ACQUIRED HAMILTON LOAN PORTFOLIO. THE FOCUS ON THE SUCCESSFUL HAMILTON SYSTEM CONVERSION IN THE THIRD QUARTER WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY RECRUITING AND ONBOARDING A TEAM OF EXPERIENCED LENDERS IN THE MARYLAND REGION RESULTED IN A SLOWDOWN IN LOAN ORIGINATION ACTIVITY IN MARYLAND. THE NOTED RATE INCREASES IN 2018 CONTRIBUTED TO THE 41 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN YIELD, BUT A FLATTENED YIELD CURVE AND THE RATE REDUCTIONS IN JULY AND SEPTEMBER, 2019, PARTIALLY OFFSET THE BENEFIT OF THE 2018 RATE INCREASES. ACCRETION OF PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERCERSBURG AND HAMILTON ACQUISITIONS INCREASED THIRD QUARTER 2019 INTEREST INCOME BY $880,000. INTEREST INCOME INCLUDED $21,000 RELATED TO THE PAYOFF OF PURCHASED CREDIT IMPAIRED LOANS.  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT SECURITIES INTEREST INCOME INCREASED $46,000 YEAR-OVER-YEAR, WITH THE AVERAGE BALANCE OF SECURITIES INCREASING $5,732,000 FROM SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THE TAXABLE EQUIVALENT YIELD WAS 3.34% YEAR-OVER-YEAR AND REFLECTED THE CHANGING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND CERTAIN REPOSITIONING WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO UNDER THE COMPANY'S ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES.  INTEREST EXPENSE ON DEPOSITS AND BORROWINGS INCREASED $3,214,000 YEAR-OVER-YEAR, WITH THE AVERAGE BALANCE OF INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS INCREASING $579,466,000 AND THE AVERAGE BALANCE OF TOTAL BORROWINGS DECREASING $30,366,000. IN ADDITION TO THE IMPACT OF THE NOTED CHANGING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT ON INTEREST EXPENSE, THE COMPANY ISSUED $32,500,000 OF 6.0% SUBORDINATED NOTES IN DECEMBER 2018. A SEASONAL INCREASE IN GOVERNMENT DEPOSITS CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE CASH ON THE BALANCE SHEET IN THE QUARTER IN 2019. DUE TO THE SHORT-TERM INCREASE IN CASH, THE COMPANY TOOK STEPS TO REDUCE BROKERED DEPOSITS IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE CASH TO A NORMAL TARGET RANGE OF $25,000,000 OR LESS. THE EXCESS CASH HELD ON THE BALANCE SHEET, TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $70,000,000 DURING THE THIRD QUARTER, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE INTEREST MARGIN BY 11 BASIS POINTS.  PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES  ASSET QUALITY TRENDS CONTINUE TO BE SOLID WITH A LOW LEVEL OF CHARGE-OFFS AND LOW NONPERFORMING LOANS. THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES TOTALED $300,000 IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, COMPARED WITH $200,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  NET RECOVERIES IN THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 TOTALED $49,000, EQUATING TO (0.01)% ANNUALIZED AS COMPARED WITH NET CHARGE-OFFS TOTALING $23,000, OR 0.01% ANNUALIZED, IN THE PREVIOUS QUARTER. NONPERFORMING LOANS TO LOANS TOTALED 0.44% OF LOANS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH 0.27% OF LOANS AT JUNE 30, 2019.

SEE NOTE 4, LOANS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, \"FINANCIAL INFORMATION,\" FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LOAN CLASSES AND DIFFERING LEVELS OF ASSOCIATED CREDIT RISK.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE LOAN PORTFOLIO, EXCLUDING RESIDENTIAL LHFS, BY SEGMENT AND CLASS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018.

TOTAL LOANS GREW $345,448,000 FROM DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. BALANCES AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $335,000,000 ACQUIRED FROM HAMILTON. THE HAMILTON ACQUISITION INCREASED THE COMPANY'S LOAN PORTFOLIO PRINCIPALLY IN THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE - FIRST LIEN, COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE - OWNER OCCUPIED AND NON-OWNER OCCUPIED, AND COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CLASSES.  COMPETITION FOR NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES REMAINS STRONG, WHICH HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A REDUCED RATE OF ORGANIC LOAN GROWTH IN 2019 COMPARED WITH PRIOR YEARS AND MAY TEMPER LOAN GROWTH IN FUTURE QUARTERS. AS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED, DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A NET $9,000,000 REDUCTION IN LOANS OUTSTANDING DUE TO REPAYMENTS TOTALING $16,000,000 FROM THE ACQUIRED HAMILTON LOAN PORTFOLIO. THE FOCUS ON THE SUCCESSFUL HAMILTON SYSTEM CONVERSION IN THE THIRD QUARTER WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY RECRUITING AND ONBOARDING A TEAM OF EXPERIENCED LENDERS IN THE MARYLAND REGION RESULTED IN A SLOWDOWN IN LOAN ORIGINATION ACTIVITY IN MARYLAND.  55  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ASSET QUALITY  RISK ELEMENTS  THE COMPANY\u2019S LOAN PORTFOLIO IS SUBJECT TO VARYING DEGREES OF CREDIT RISK. CREDIT RISK IS MANAGED THROUGH OUR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, ON-GOING CREDIT REVIEWS, AND MONITORING OF ASSET QUALITY MEASURES. ADDITIONALLY, LOAN PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION, WHICH LIMITS EXPOSURE TO A SINGLE INDUSTRY OR BORROWER, AND COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS ALSO MITIGATE OUR RISK OF CREDIT LOSS.  THE LOAN PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY OF LOANS TO BORROWERS IN SOUTH CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA AND THE GREATER BALTIMORE, MARYLAND REGION. AS THE MAJORITY OF LOANS ARE CONCENTRATED IN THESE GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BORROWERS' ABILITY TO HONOR THEIR OBLIGATIONS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE LEVEL OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE MARKET AREAS.  NONPERFORMING ASSETS INCLUDE NONACCRUAL LOANS AND FORECLOSED REAL ESTATE. IN ADDITION, RESTRUCTURED LOANS STILL ACCRUING AND LOANS PAST DUE 90 DAYS OR MORE AND STILL ACCRUING ARE ALSO DEEMED TO BE RISK ASSETS. FOR ALL LOAN CLASSES, GENERALLY THE ACCRUAL OF INTEREST INCOME CEASES WHEN PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST IS PAST DUE 90 DAYS OR MORE AND COLLATERAL IS INADEQUATE TO COVER PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST OR IMMEDIATELY IF, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, FULL COLLECTION IS UNLIKELY. INTEREST WILL CONTINUE TO ACCRUE ON LOANS PAST DUE 90 DAYS OR MORE IF THE COLLATERAL IS ADEQUATE TO COVER PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST, AND THE LOAN IS IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION. INTEREST ACCRUED, BUT NOT COLLECTED, AS OF THE DATE OF PLACEMENT ON NONACCRUAL STATUS, IS GENERALLY REVERSED AND CHARGED AGAINST INTEREST INCOME, UNLESS FULLY COLLATERALIZED. SUBSEQUENT PAYMENTS RECEIVED ARE EITHER APPLIED TO THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OR RECORDED AS INTEREST INCOME, DEPENDING ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S ASSESSMENT OF THE ULTIMATE COLLECTABILITY OF PRINCIPAL. LOANS ARE RETURNED TO ACCRUAL STATUS, FOR ALL LOAN CLASSES, WHEN ALL THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST AMOUNTS CONTRACTUALLY DUE ARE BROUGHT CURRENT, THE LOANS HAVE PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE NOTE FOR A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME, GENERALLY SIX MONTHS, AND THE ULTIMATE COLLECTABILITY OF THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS REASONABLY ASSURED. PAST DUE STATUS IS BASED ON CONTRACT TERMS OF THE LOAN.  LOANS, THE TERMS OF WHICH ARE MODIFIED, ARE CLASSIFIED AS TDRS IF A CONCESSION WAS GRANTED FOR LEGAL OR ECONOMIC REASONS RELATED TO A BORROWER\u2019S FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. CONCESSIONS GRANTED UNDER A TDR TYPICALLY INVOLVE A TEMPORARY DEFERRAL OF SCHEDULED LOAN PAYMENTS, AN EXTENSION OF A LOAN\u2019S STATED MATURITY DATE, TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN INTEREST RATES, OR BELOW MARKET RATES. IF A MODIFICATION OCCURS WHILE THE LOAN IS ON ACCRUING STATUS, IT WILL CONTINUE TO ACCRUE INTEREST UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS. NONACCRUAL TDRS ARE RESTORED TO ACCRUAL STATUS IF SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS, UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS, ARE CURRENT FOR SIX MONTHS AFTER MODIFICATION, AND THE BORROWER CONTINUES TO DEMONSTRATE ITS ABILITY TO MEET THE MODIFIED TERMS. TDRS ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT IF THEY HAVE BEEN RESTRUCTURED DURING THE MOST RECENT CALENDAR YEAR, OR IF THEY ARE NOT PERFORMING ACCORDING TO THEIR MODIFIED TERMS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE COMPANY\u2019S RISK ELEMENTS, INCLUDING THE AGGREGATE BALANCES OF NONACCRUAL LOANS, RESTRUCTURED LOANS STILL ACCRUING, LOANS PAST DUE 90 DAYS OR MORE, AND OREO AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

IMPAIRMENT RESERVES REMAIN IN PLACE IF UPDATED APPRAISALS ARE PENDING, AND REPRESENT MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATE OF POTENTIAL LOSS.  INTERNAL LOAN REVIEWS ARE COMPLETED ANNUALLY ON ALL COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH A COMMITTED LOAN BALANCE IN EXCESS OF $500,000, WHICH INCLUDES CONFIRMATION OF RISK RATING BY AN INDEPENDENT CREDIT OFFICER. CREDIT ADMINISTRATION ALSO REVIEWS LOANS IN EXCESS OF $1,000,000.  IN ADDITION, ALL RELATIONSHIPS GREATER THAN $250,000 RATED SUBSTANDARD, DOUBTFUL OR LOSS ARE REVIEWED AND CORRESPONDING RISK RATINGS ARE REAFFIRMED BY THE BANK'S PROBLEM LOAN COMMITTEE, WITH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING TO THE ERM COMMITTEE.  IN ITS INDIVIDUAL LOAN IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE EXTENT OF ANY FULL OR PARTIAL CHARGE-OFFS THAT MAY BE REQUIRED, OR ANY RESERVES THAT MAY BE NEEDED. THE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CHARGE-OFFS OR IMPAIRMENT RESERVE INCLUDE AN EVALUATION OF THE OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCE AND THE RELATED COLLATERAL SECURING THE CREDIT. THROUGH A COMBINATION OF COLLATERAL SECURING THE LOANS AND PARTIAL CHARGE-OFFS TAKEN TO DATE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS ADEQUATELY PROVIDED FOR THE POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT IT MAY INCUR ON THESE RELATIONSHIPS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. HOWEVER, OVER TIME, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MAY RESULT IN INCREASED RESERVE ALLOCATIONS OR, ALTERNATIVELY, IT MAY BE DEEMED THAT THE RESERVE ALLOCATIONS EXCEED THOSE THAT ARE NEEDED.  57  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY\u2019S OREO TOTALED $642,000 AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND CONSISTED OF TWO COMMERCIAL AND ONE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES. THE INCREASE IN OREO FROM $130,000 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS THE RESULT OF THE ADDITION OF ONE COMMERCIAL AND ONE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY. ALL PROPERTIES ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, LESS COSTS TO DISPOSE.  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE VALUE OF OREO REPRESENTS THE PROPERTIES' FAIR VALUES, BUT IF THE REAL ESTATE MARKET CHANGES, ADDITIONAL EXPENSE MAY BE RECORDED.  CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES  THE COMPANY MAINTAINS THE ALL AT A LEVEL DEEMED ADEQUATE BY MANAGEMENT FOR PROBABLE INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES. THE ALL IS ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED THROUGH A PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES CHARGED TO EARNINGS. QUARTERLY, MANAGEMENT ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALL USING A DEFINED METHODOLOGY WHICH CONSIDERS SPECIFIC CREDIT EVALUATION OF IMPAIRED LOANS, PAST LOAN LOSS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS. MANAGEMENT ADDRESSES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR LOANS INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIED AS IMPAIRED, LOANS COLLECTIVELY EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT, AND OTHER BANK REGULATORY GUIDANCE IN ITS ASSESSMENT.  THE ALL IS EVALUATED BASED ON REVIEW OF THE COLLECTABILITY OF LOANS IN LIGHT OF HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE; THE NATURE AND VOLUME OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO; ADVERSE SITUATIONS THAT MAY AFFECT A BORROWER\u2019S ABILITY TO REPAY; ESTIMATED VALUE OF ANY UNDERLYING COLLATERAL; AND PREVAILING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THIS EVALUATION IS INHERENTLY SUBJECTIVE AS IT REQUIRES ESTIMATES THAT ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SIGNIFICANT REVISION AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

THE ASSET QUALITY RATIOS PREVIOUSLY NOTED ARE INDICATIVE OF THE CONTINUED BENEFIT THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED FROM FAVORABLE HISTORICAL CHARGE-OFF STATISTICS AND GENERALLY STABLE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS, EVEN WHILE THE LOAN PORTFOLIO HAS BEEN GROWING.  RECENT LOAN GROWTH TRENDS CONTRIBUTED TO MANAGEMENT'S DETERMINATION THAT A PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES WAS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE ALL, WITH AN ALL TO TOTAL LOANS RATIO OF 0.93% AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. A PRINCIPAL FACTOR IMPACTING A COMPARISON WITH THE ALL TO TOTAL LOANS RATIO OF 1.27% AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WAS LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE MERCERSBURG AND HAMILTON TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH INCORPORATED A CREDIT FACTOR, AND DID NOT REQUIRE AN INCREASE IN THE COMPANY'S ALL.  DESPITE GENERALLY FAVORABLE HISTORICAL CHARGE-OFF DATA AND STABLE ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, THE GROWTH THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED IN ITS LOAN PORTFOLIO MAY RESULT IN THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR LOAN LOSSES IN FUTURE QUARTERS.  60  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE ENDING LOAN BALANCES INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON LOAN TYPE, AS WELL AS THE ALL ALLOCATION FOR EACH, AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, INCLUDING PCI LOANS.

AS UPDATED APPRAISALS ARE RECEIVED ON COLLATERAL-DEPENDENT LOANS, PARTIAL CHARGE-OFFS ARE TAKEN TO THE EXTENT THE LOANS\u2019 PRINCIPAL BALANCE EXCEEDS THEIR FAIR VALUE.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE ALLOCATION OF THE ALL BETWEEN THE VARIOUS LOAN CLASSES ADEQUATELY REFLECTS THE PROBABLE INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES IN EACH PORTFOLIO AND IS BASED ON THE METHODOLOGY OUTLINED IN NOTE 4, LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, \"FINANCIAL INFORMATION.\" MANAGEMENT RE-EVALUATES AND MAKES ENHANCEMENTS TO ITS RESERVE METHODOLOGY TO BETTER REFLECT THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE PORTFOLIO, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF INCREASED CHARGE-OFFS, WITH NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT LOAN CLASSES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE ENHANCEMENTS TO THE ALL METHODOLOGY IMPROVE THE ACCURACY OF QUANTIFYING PROBABLE INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES INHERENT IN THE PORTFOLIO. MANAGEMENT CHARGES ACTUAL LOAN LOSSES TO THE RESERVE AND BASES THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES ON ITS OVERALL ANALYSIS.  THE UNALLOCATED PORTION OF THE ALL REFLECTS ESTIMATED INHERENT LOSSES WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DETECTED, AS WELL AS THE RISK OF ERROR IN THE SPECIFIC AND GENERAL RESERVE ALLOCATION, OTHER POTENTIAL EXPOSURE IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO, VARIANCES IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S ASSESSMENT OF NATIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES APPROPRIATE AT THE TIME. THE UNALLOCATED PORTION OF THE ALL TOTALED $126,000, OR 0.9% OF THE ALL BALANCE, AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED WITH $570,000, OR 4.1% OF THE ALL BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE COMPANY MONITORS THE UNALLOCATED PORTION OF THE ALL AND, BY POLICY, HAS DETERMINED IT SHOULD NOT EXCEED 6% OF THE TOTAL RESERVE. FUTURE NEGATIVE PROVISIONS FOR LOAN LOSSES MAY RESULT IF THE UNALLOCATED PORTION WAS TO INCREASE, AND MANAGEMENT DETERMINED THE RESERVES WERE NOT REQUIRED FOR THE ANTICIPATED RISK IN THE PORTFOLIO.  61  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY\u2019S ALL IS ADEQUATE BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION. FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ALL AND ENHANCEMENTS TO THE METHODOLOGY MAY BE NECESSARY DUE TO CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, REGULATORY GUIDANCE, OR MANAGEMENT\u2019S ASSUMPTIONS AS TO FUTURE DELINQUENCIES OR LOSS RATES.  DEPOSITS  DEPOSITS TOTALED $1,923,454,000 AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AN INCREASE OF $364,698,000, OR 23.4%, FROM $1,558,756,000 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018.  NONINTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS INCREASED $41,930,000, OR 20.5%, FROM DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS TOTALED $1,676,681,000 AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AN INCREASE OF $322,768,000, OR 23.8% FROM THE $1,353,913,000 BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE HAMILTON ACQUISITION CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 80% OF THE INCREASE IN TOTAL DEPOSITS.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INCREASE BOTH NONINTEREST-BEARING AND INTEREST-BEARING DEPOSIT RELATIONSHIPS FROM ITS ENHANCED CASH MANAGEMENT OFFERINGS AS IT INCREASES ITS COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS. DEPOSIT GROWTH IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 WAS PRINCIPALLY USED TO REDUCE TOTAL BORROWINGS, TO FUND GROWTH IN THE LOAN AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS, AND TO REDUCE BROKERED DEPOSITS BY APPROXIMATELY $91,000,000.  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND REGULATORY MATTERS  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN A REGULATED FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY MUST PROPERLY BALANCE RETURN ON EQUITY TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS WHILE MAINTAINING SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF CAPITAL AND RELATED RISK-BASED REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS TO SATISFY STATUTORY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY\u2019S CAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE ATTRACTIVE RATES OF RETURNS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS, WHILE MAINTAINING A \u201cWELL CAPITALIZED\u201d POSITION OF REGULATORY STRENGTH.  SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY TOTALED $223,493,000 AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AND INCREASED $50,060,000 OR 28.9%, FROM $173,433,000 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN RETAINED EARNINGS TOTALING $12,690,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, NET OF DIVIDENDS PAID ON COMMON STOCK TOTALING $4,472,000, AND IMPROVEMENT IN NET UNREALIZED GAINS/LOSSES IN AOCI, NET OF TAXES, TOTALING $5,647,000, AND THE ISSUANCE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF HAMILTON TOTALING $36,622,000.  THE COMPANY ROUTINELY EVALUATES ITS CAPITAL LEVELS IN LIGHT OF ITS RISK PROFILE TO ASSESS ITS CAPITAL NEEDS. THE COMPANY AND THE BANK ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED BY FEDERAL AND STATE BANKING AGENCIES. THE CONSOLIDATED ASSET LIMIT ON SMALL BANK HOLDING COMPANIES IS $3,000,000,000 AND A COMPANY WITH ASSETS UNDER THAT LIMIT IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE FRB CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RULES, BUT MAY FILE REPORTS THAT INCLUDE CAPITAL AMOUNTS AND RATIOS. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO FILE THOSE REPORTS.  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE BANK WAS CONSIDERED WELL CAPITALIZED UNDER APPLICABLE BANKING REGULATIONS. UNDER CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES AND THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION, THE BANK MUST MEET SPECIFIC GUIDELINES THAT INVOLVE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS AS CALCULATED UNDER REGULATORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION PROVISIONS ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO BANK HOLDING COMPANIES, INCLUDING FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES.  NOTE 9, SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND REGULATORY CAPITAL, TO THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, \"FINANCIAL INFORMATION,\" INCLUDES A TABLE PRESENTING CAPITAL AMOUNTS AND RATIOS FOR THE COMPANY AND THE BANK AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018.  IN ADDITION TO THE MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENT AND MINIMUM CAPITAL RATIO TO BE WELL CAPITALIZED PRESENTED IN THE REFERENCED TABLE IN NOTE 9, THE BANK MUST MAINTAIN A CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER AS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, ITEM 1 - BUSINESS, UNDER THE TOPIC BASEL III CAPITAL RULES. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE BANK'S CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER, BASED ON THE MOST RESTRICTIVE TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS CAPITAL RATIO, WAS 5.6%, WHICH IS GREATER THAN THE 2.50% REQUIREMENT FOR 2019.  62  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY  THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT IS TO ENSURE ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND MANAGE THE COMPANY\u2019S SENSITIVITY TO CHANGING INTEREST RATES. LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT INVOLVES THE ABILITY TO MEET THE CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS OF CUSTOMERS WHO MAY BE EITHER DEPOSITORS WANTING TO WITHDRAW FUNDS OR BORROWERS NEEDING ASSURANCE THAT SUFFICIENT FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO MEET THEIR CREDIT NEEDS. OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF FUNDS CONSIST OF DEPOSIT INFLOWS, LOAN REPAYMENTS, MATURITIES AND SALES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, THE SALE OF MORTGAGE LOANS AND BORROWINGS FROM THE FHLB OF PITTSBURGH. WHILE MATURITIES AND SCHEDULED AMORTIZATION OF LOANS AND SECURITIES ARE PREDICTABLE SOURCES OF FUNDS, DEPOSIT FLOWS AND MORTGAGE PREPAYMENTS ARE GREATLY INFLUENCED BY GENERAL INTEREST RATES, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND COMPETITION.  WE REGULARLY ADJUST OUR INVESTMENTS IN LIQUID ASSETS BASED UPON OUR ASSESSMENT OF EXPECTED LOAN DEMAND, EXPECTED DEPOSIT FLOWS, YIELDS AVAILABLE ON INTEREST-EARNING DEPOSITS AND SECURITIES AND THE OBJECTIVES OF OUR ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POLICY.  MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS  SEE NOTE 2, MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER PART I, ITEM 1, \"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\" IN THIS FORM 10-Q.

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS 10% AND (9%) AND THE RATE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 WAS 24% AND 49%, RESPECTIVELY.  NET INCOME (LOSS)  NET INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 WAS $0.4 MILLION. NET LOSS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $1.5 MILLION AND NET INCOME FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 WAS $0.4 MILLION.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $0.2 MILLION. NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 WAS $2.6 MILLION DRIVEN BY THE NET INCOME NET OF THE NONCASH ADJUSTMENT OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, ALONG WITH AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORIES.  WE HAVE SATISFIED OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WITH CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND A BANK OPERATING LINE OF CREDIT. WE HAVE A CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH BANK OF AMERICA (BOFA) WHICH WAS ENTERED INTO ON JUNE 15, 2017 AND AMENDED ON DECEMBER 29, 2017 AND PROVIDES FOR A LINE OF CREDIT ARRANGEMENT OF $16.0 MILLION THAT EXPIRES ON JUNE 15, 2022. THE CREDIT ARRANGEMENT ALSO HAS A $5.0 MILLION REAL ESTATE TERM NOTE OUTSTANDING WITH A MATURITY DATE OF JUNE 15, 2022.  BOTH THE LINE OF CREDIT AND REAL ESTATE TERM NOTES ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE LIBOR RATES. THE LINE OF CREDIT AND REAL ESTATE TERM NOTES WITH BOFA CONTAIN CERTAIN COVENANTS WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRE US TO ADHERE TO REGULAR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, ABIDE BY ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS, MAINTAIN CERTAIN FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF ANNUAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR LINE IS SUBJECT TO BORROWING BASE REQUIREMENTS, AND ADVANCES ARE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE LENDER. THE LINE OF CREDIT IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS.  ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD OUTSTANDING ADVANCES OF $12.4 MILLION UNDER THE LINE OF CREDIT AND UNUSED AVAILABILITY OF $3.5 MILLION SUPPORTED BY OUR BORROWING BASE. WE BELIEVE OUR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND CASH FLOWS TO BE PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR FUTURE WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS. OUR WORKING CAPITAL WAS $22.7 MILLION AND $20.7 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE BOFA CREDIT AGREEMENT AS AMENDED PROVIDES FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF NOT LESS THAN (I) 1.0 TO 1.0 FOR EACH PERIOD OF FOUR FISCAL QUARTERS, COMMENCING WITH THE PERIOD OF FOUR FISCAL QUARTERS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE DID NOT MEET THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO WHICH WAS WAIVED BY BOFA IN THE THIRD AMENDMENT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT RECEIVED ON NOVEMBER 8, 2019.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ACTIVITIES AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4) OF REGULATION S-K.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE SUMMARIZED IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.

MANIFESTING THIS VISION REQUIRES SCALING OUR DIRECT AND INDIRECT CONNECTIVITY TO MULTIPLE PAYMENT AND MOBILE NETWORKS INTERNATIONALLY. BY IMPLEMENTING THIS VISION, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CENTRALIZED, GLOBAL MULTI-CHANNEL TRANSACTIONAL PLATFORM TO OUR CLIENTS INTERNATIONALLY.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR STRATEGY  OUR STRATEGY IS TO CAPITALIZE ON CONSUMER APPETITE FOR DIGITAL PAYMENT METHODS, THE PERCEIVED MOVEMENT TOWARDS A CASHLESS SOCIETY. TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR BUSINESS, OUR STRATEGY IS TO FOCUS ON PROVIDING MERCHANTS WITH THE ABILITY TO PROCESS A VARIETY OF ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE CHANNELS. WE SEEK TO LEVERAGE THE ADOPTION OF AND TRANSITION TO CARD, ELECTRONIC AND DIGITAL-BASED PAYMENTS BY EXPANDING OUR MARKET SHARE THROUGH OUR DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND SERVICES INNOVATIONS. WE ALSO SEEK GROWTH THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS TO IMPROVE OUR OFFERINGS, SCALE AND GEOGRAPHY. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN AND LEVERAGE OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR PEOPLE TO INCREASE OUR PENETRATION IN EXISTING MARKETS.  KEY ELEMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY INCLUDE.  \u25cf  CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN OUR CORE TECHNOLOGY AND NEW TECHNOLOGY OFFERINGS;  \u25cf  ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE TO GROW IN COMMERCE AND PAYMENTS SEGMENTS;  \u25cf  GROW AND CONTROL DISTRIBUTION BY ADDING NEW MERCHANTS AND PARTNERS;  \u25cf  LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL ADVANTAGES THROUGHOUT OUR GLOBAL FOOTPRINT;  \u25cf  EXPANSION OF OUR CARDHOLDER AND SUBSCRIBER CUSTOMER BASE;  \u25cf  CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SEAMLESS MULTINATIONAL SOLUTIONS FOR OUR CLIENTS;  \u25cf  INCREASE MONETIZATION WHILE CREATING VALUE FOR OUR CLIENTS;  \u25cf  FOCUS ON CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT AND OPERATION EXCELLENCE; AND  \u25cf  PURSUE POTENTIAL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ACQUISITIONS OF, INVESTMENTS IN, AND ALLIANCES WITH COMPANIES THAT HAVE HIGH GROWTH POTENTIAL, SIGNIFICANT MARKET PRESENCE OR KEY TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES.  AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY, WE ENTERED INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 WITH BANK SPUTNIK (\u201cSPUTNIK\u201d), LOCATED IN RUSSIA, TO LAUNCH A TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM EXPECTED TO PROVIDE A SUITE OF FRICTIONLESS PAYMENT ACCEPTANCE SERVICES FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND VALUE-ADDED PROVIDERS. THIS NEW PAYMENT PROCESSING CENTER WOULD INTEGRATE SPUTNIK\u2019S EXPERTISE IN ENABLING SECURE GLOBALLY INTER-OPERABLE FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS WITH OUR EXPERTISE IN DEVELOPING FRICTIONLESS VALUE- ADDED PAYMENT ACCEPTANCE SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THIS PAYMENT PROCESSING CENTER WAS EXPECTED TO ACCELERATE THE DELIVERY OF PAYMENT ACCEPTANCE SERVICES IN THIS MARKET, COMBINING BANKING SERVICES AND BILL PAYMENTS IN A MULTI-CHANNEL ENVIRONMENT. THIS JOINT VENTURE WITH SPUTNIK WAS SUBJECT TO APPROVAL OF THE SHAREHOLDERS OF SPUTNIK AND THE REGULATORS IN RUSSIA. SPUTNIK\u2019S SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED THE TRANSACTION; HOWEVER SPUTNIK, DID NOT OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL, AS THEY DECLINED BELOW THE REQUIRED PAID IN CAPITAL RESERVES. PAYONLINE CONTINUES TO BE COMMITTED TO THE PAYMENT PROCESSING CENTER BUSINESS PLAN. ACCORDINGLY, PAYONLINE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH EACH OF MOBI.MONEY CJSC (\u201cMOBI.MONEY\u201d), AND VTB BANK, BOTH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AS SPONSORING AND TRANSACTION CLEARING BANKS. THIS NEW ARRANGEMENT RECEIVED REGULATORY APPROVAL IN RUSSIA. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, PAYONLINE HAS ENTERED INTO A FINANCIAL SERVICES AGREEMENT FOR TRANSACTION CLEARING SERVICES WITH MOBI.MONEY AND AMENDED ITS AGREEMENT WITH VTB BANK, ALLOWING FOR GREATER SCALABILITY AND SPONSORSHIP OF PAYONLINE TO CARD BRANDS. CARD BRANDS HAVE INITIATED PROJECTS FOR REGISTRATION OF PAYONLINE AS A THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT PROCESSOR. FOLLOWING SUCCESSFUL REGISTRATION, PAYONLINE PLANS TO FURTHER IMPLEMENT DIRECT INTEGRATIONS WITH INTERNATIONAL PAYMENT NETWORKS (\u201cIPNS\u201d). IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ITS BUSINESS PLAN, PAYONLINE HAS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL INVESTORS FOR FINANCING A PROPOSED VENTURE. THE EXECUTIVE TEAM CONTINUES TO WORK DILIGENTLY TO SELECT THE MOST CAPABLE FINANCIAL PARTNER FOR THIS VENTURE.  WITH OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS, WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN ACCOMMODATE EXPECTED REVENUE GROWTH. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE WILL ALLOW US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND INCREASED MARGIN AS WE GROW OUR PROCESSING VOLUME AND EXPAND TO OTHER GEOGRAPHICAL TERRITORIES.  MARKET OVERVIEW  THE FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY AND TRANSACTION PROCESSING INDUSTRY IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF TODAY\u2019S WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL STRUCTURE. THE INDUSTRY IS CONTINUALLY EVOLVING, DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES. THE BENEFITS OF CARD-BASED PAYMENTS ALLOW MERCHANTS TO ACCESS A BROADER UNIVERSE OF CONSUMERS, ENJOY FASTER SETTLEMENT TIMES AND REDUCE TRANSACTION ERRORS. BY USING CREDIT OR DEBIT CARDS, CONSUMERS ARE ABLE TO MAKE PURCHASES MORE CONVENIENTLY, WHETHER IN PERSON, OVER THE INTERNET, OR BY MAIL, FAX OR TELEPHONE, WHILE GAINING THE BENEFIT OF LOYALTY PROGRAMS, SUCH AS FREQUENT FLYER MILES OR CASH BACK, WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY BEING OFFERED BY CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD ISSUERS.  IN ADDITION, CONSUMERS ARE ALSO BEGINNING TO USE CARD-BASED AND OTHER ELECTRONIC PAYMENT METHODS FOR PURCHASES AT AN EARLIER AGE IN LIFE, AND INCREASINGLY FOR SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNT PURCHASES. GIVEN THESE ADVANTAGES OF CARD-BASED PAYMENT SYSTEMS TO MERCHANTS AND CONSUMERS, FAVORABLE DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS, AND THE RESULTING PROLIFERATION OF CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD USAGE, WE BELIEVE BUSINESSES WILL INCREASINGLY SEEK TO ACCEPT CARD-BASED PAYMENT SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE.  WE BELIEVE THAT CASH TRANSACTIONS ARE BECOMING PROGRESSIVELY OBSOLETE. THE PROLIFERATION OF BANKCARDS HAS MADE THE ACCEPTANCE OF BANKCARD PAYMENTS A VIRTUAL NECESSITY FOR MANY BUSINESSES, REGARDLESS OF SIZE, IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. IN ADDITION, THE ADVENT AND GROWTH OF E-COMMERCE AND CRYPTO-CURRENCIES HAVE MARKED A SIGNIFICANT NEW TREND IN THE WAY BUSINESS IS BEING CONDUCTED. E-COMMERCE IS DEPENDENT UPON CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS, AS WELL AS OTHER CASHLESS PAYMENT PROCESSING METHODS.  THE PAYMENT PROCESSING INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE RAPIDLY, BASED ON THE APPLICATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGY AND CHANGING CUSTOMER NEEDS. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO EVOLVE WITH THE MARKET TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES TO MEET THE EVER-CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR MARKET PLACE. TRADITIONAL PLAYERS IN THE INDUSTRY MUST QUICKLY ADAPT TO THE CHANGING ENVIRONMENT OR BE LEFT BEHIND IN THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE.  23  BUSINESS SEGMENTS  WE OPERATE TWO REPORTABLE BUSINESS OPERATING SEGMENTS: (I) NORTH AMERICAN TRANSACTION SOLUTIONS AND (II) INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION SOLUTIONS. OUR SEGMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO ESTABLISH LINES OF BUSINESSES THAT SUPPORT OUR CLIENT BASE AND FURTHER GLOBALIZE OUR SOLUTIONS. MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS BASED ON THE INTERNAL REPORTING USED BY OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE AND TO ASSESS WHERE TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES.

GEOGRAPHICAL PRESENCE FOR THIS SEGMENT IS NORTH AMERICA.

OUR PROPRIETARY SAAS SUITE OF SOLUTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC AND MOBILE COMMERCE GATEWAY AND PAYMENT PROCESSING PLATFORM IS COMPLIANT AT LEVEL 1 OF PCI DSS, STREAMLINES THE ORDER-TO-CASH PROCESS, IMPROVES ELECTRONIC PAYMENT ACCEPTANCE AND REDUCES THE SCOPE OF BURDEN OF PCI DSS COMPLIANCE.

NET REVENUES WERE APPROXIMATELY $48.4 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $49.7 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE DECREASE IN NET REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION SOLUTIONS SEGMENT WHICH EXPERIENCED COMPETITION, CERTAIN ECONOMIC CHALLENGES, AND THE LOSS OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER. IN ADDITION, GROWTH IN OUR NORTH AMERICAN TRANSACTION SOLUTIONS SEGMENT WAS OFFSET BY THE WIND-DOWN OF CERTAIN MERCHANT CATEGORIES DUE TO THE INDUSTRY-WIDE CHANGES FOR ENHANCED CARD ASSOCIATION AND SPONSORING COMPLIANCE.  COST OF REVENUES REPRESENTS DIRECT COSTS OF GENERATING REVENUES, INCLUDING COMMISSIONS, MOBILE OPERATOR FEES, INTERCHANGE EXPENSE, PROCESSING, AND NON-PROCESSING FEES. COST OF REVENUES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE APPROXIMATELY $40.2 MILLION AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $42 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE DECREASE IN COST OF REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE REORGANIZATION OF ASSIGNMENTS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION SOLUTIONS SEGMENT DUE TO ECONOMIC CHALLENGES FACING THIS SEGMENT.  THE GROSS MARGIN FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS APPROXIMATELY $8.1 MILLION, OR 16.8% OF NET REVENUES, AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $7.7 MILLION, OR 15.5% OF NET REVENUES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE INCREASE IN THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS THE RESULT OF NORTH AMERICAN TRANSACTION SOLUTIONS PROCESSING OF TRANSACTIONS UTILIZING OUR SELF-DESIGNATED BIN/ICA, RECURRING PROFITABLE CASH FLOWS FROM THE PORTFOLIOS ACQUIRED IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AND FURTHER ACCEPTANCE OF VALUE-ADDED SERVICES BY THE MERCHANTS.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OPERATING EXPENSES ANALYSIS.

NON-CASH COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.0 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $127,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASE IN EXPENSE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NON-CASH COMPENSATION OF SHARES AND STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED TO NAMED EXECUTIVES, CERTAIN EMPLOYEES, AND CERTAIN CONSULTANTS IN CONNECTION WITH EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARDS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  BAD DEBT EXPENSE ANALYSIS.  WE REFLECTED A BAD DEBT EXPENSE ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, WHICH REPRESENTS UNCOLLECTED FEES OF APPROXIMATELY $900,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $700,000 FROM THE PREVIOUS COMPARABLE PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE REQUIRED CLOSURE OF CERTAIN HIGH-RISK MERCHANTS FROM A THIRD-PARTY PLATFORM TO OUR OWN DESIGNATED BIN IN THE PRIOR PERIOD. THIS RESULTED IN A WRITE-OFF OF ACCOUNTS DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE APPROXIMATING $365,000. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, TOTAL GROSS ACH REJECTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION OF WHICH $665,000 WERE SUBSEQUENTLY COLLECTED. WE WERE ABLE TO PASS THROUGH TO ISOS,VIA A REDUCTION IN COMMISSIONS, $253,000 FROM THE TOTAL GROSS ACH REJECTS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THE AMORTIZATION OF MERCHANT PORTFOLIOS IN CONNECTION WITH RESIDUAL BUYOUT ARRANGEMENTS AND CLIENT ACQUISITION COSTS. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.4 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AMORTIZATION OF THE RESIDUAL BUYOUT ARRANGEMENTS ACQUIRED DURING 2018 AND AN INCREASE IN CLIENT ACQUISITION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW MERCHANTS BOARDED.  INTEREST EXPENSE.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 IS AS FOLLOWS;  FUNDING SOURCE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  INCREASE / (DECREASE)  MBF NOTES  $-  $10,359  $(10,359  )  RBL NOTES  730,992  483,477  247,515  PPS NOTE  -  149,482  (149,482  )  OTHER  36,683  51,592  (14,909  )  TOTAL  $767,676  $694,910  $72,766  TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE REMAINED STEADY PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PAYOFFS TO THE PRIORITY PAYMENTS NOTE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, AND THE REFINANCING OF THE RBL NOTES.  OTHER INCOME.  OTHER INCOME INCREASED FROM APPROXIMATELY $365,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 TO APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO RECOGNIZING OTHER INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 MILLION RELATING TO MERCHANT RESERVES RECORDED IN A PREVIOUS YEAR DEEMED NOT TO BE AN OBLIGATION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. REFER TO NOTE 6 IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  TOTAL ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE APPROXIMATELY $23.4 MILLION COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $25.8 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE NET DECREASE IN TOTAL ASSETS WAS THE RESULT OF CASH UTILIZED TO FUND OPERATIONS AND PAY DOWN NOTES PAYABLE, A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, AND AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO GOODWILL, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR RECORDING OF THE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET FOR OUR NORTH AMERICAN TRANSACTIONS SOLUTION'S SEGMENT'S U.S. HEADQUARTERS OPERATING FACILITY AS A RESULT OF OUR ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD.  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY $7.4 MILLION AND APPROXIMATELY $9.7 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE DECREASE IN CURRENT ASSETS WAS THE UTILIZATION OF CASH ON HAND TO FUND OPERATIONS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AND A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT WE WILL REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY $3.6  MILLION TO FINANCE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS.  TO FUND OUR OPERATING CASH NEEDS, WE MAY NEED TO BORROW ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FROM OUR CURRENT CREDIT FACILITIES OR ADDITIONAL SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE THE CAPITAL MARKETS FOR SOURCES OF FUNDING, WHICH COULD TAKE THE FORM OF ADDITIONAL DEBT, THE RESTRUCTURING OF OUR CURRENT DEBT, OR ADDITIONAL EQUITY FINANCING. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN RESTRUCTURING ITS CURRENT DEBT FACILITIES WITH COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TERMS THAT ENSURES THE CONTINUED OPERATION OF ITS BUSINESS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $9.3 MILLION IN AVAILABLE CREDIT FACILITIES.  ADDITIONAL FUNDS MAY BE RAISED THROUGH DEBT FINANCING AND/OR THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, THERE BEING NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY TYPE OF FINANCING ON TERMS SATISFACTORY TO US WILL BE AVAILABLE OR OTHERWISE OCCUR. DEBT FINANCING MUST BE REPAID REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE GENERATE REVENUES OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND MAY BE SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS. ANY EQUITY FINANCING OR DEBT FINANCING THAT REQUIRES THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES OR WARRANTS TO THE LENDER WOULD CAUSE THE PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP BY OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS TO BE DILUTED, WHICH DILUTION MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL. ALSO, ANY ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES ISSUED MAY HAVE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES OR PRIVILEGES SENIOR TO THOSE OF EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. IF SUCH FINANCINGS ARE NOT AVAILABLE WHEN REQUIRED OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLANS OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND/OR PROSPECTS.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET ELEMENT, INC.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY $2.4 MILLION IN CASH FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION OF CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

CHEN, AND VMSO NOW HOLDS ALL OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER ASSETS RELATED TO  THE  CLEAR  V  ALE AND VMOSO PLATFORMS  , AND TO MVN  , REDUCING OUR EXPOSURE TO FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION COST OF CLEARVALE, VMOSO AND MVN. HOWEVER, FURTHER COST REDUCTIONS MAY RESULT IN VOLUNTARY DEPARTURES OF HIGHLY SKILLED TECHNICAL AND MANAGERIAL PERSONNEL FROM OUR COMPANY, WHICH  WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  OUR SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 DECONSOLIDATION OF VMSO RESULTED IN $1.6 MILLION OF CASH RAISED IN THE VMSO FINANCING BEING DECONSOLIDATED. WE EXPECT TO OPPORTUNISTICALLY SEEK TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH PRIVATE OR PUBLIC SALES OF SECURITIES, STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS, BANK DEBT, FINANCING UNDER LEASING ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHERWISE. IF ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE RAISED THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, THE PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP OF OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE REDUCED, STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL DILUTION OR ANY EQUITY SECURITIES WE SELL MAY HAVE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES OR PRIVILEGES SENIOR TO THOSE OF THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE EXPECT THAT OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS WOULD BE DIFFICULT, AT BEST. IF ADEQUATE FUNDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY OUR DEBTS AS THEY BECOME DUE, DEVELOP OUR PRODUCTS, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES OR RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES OR UNANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS CANNOT BE PREDICTED AT THIS TIME. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISH THESE PLANS AND SECURE SOURCES OF FINANCING AND/OR REDUCE COSTS AND ULTIMATELY ATTAIN PROFITABLE OPERATIONS.  \ufeff  THE FOLLOWING TABLE REPRESENTS OUR LIQUIDITY AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).  \ufeff                                                  \ufeff                                                  \ufeff          SEPTEMBER 30,          DECEMBER 31,  \ufeff          2019          2018  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS          $2,169                $2,574        WORKING CAPITAL          $1,947                $1,845        WORKING CAPITAL RATIO                  1.95                        1.97        \ufeff           23           CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  \ufeff  CASH USED IN OPERATING  ACTIVITIES WAS $2.0 MILLION FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A  $0.  7  MILLION  OPERATING  LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND A $2.2 MILLION  NET LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS RELATED TO THE VMOSO AND CLEARVALE PRODUCTS, AND MVN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS EXCLUDING A $2.3 MILLION GAIN ON THE DECONSOLIDATION OF VMSO,  OFFSET BY NONCASH ITEMS AND CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER COMPENSATION COSTS, INCLUDING STORE WAGES, AND MARKETING EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BROAD-BASED COST SAVINGS.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , OUR SG&A EXPENSE RATE WAS  21.4 PERCENT  COMPARED WITH  21.7 PERCENT  IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR.

FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , AND  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , INCLUDES TAX EFFECT OF  $1,024 MILLION  AND  $514 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO EBIT, AND  $19 MILLION  AND  $10 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO OPERATING LEASE INTEREST.  (D)  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , AND  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , INCLUDES DISCRETE TAX ITEMS OF $(3) MILLION AND $382 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THE TAX ACT.

OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE INCLUDES SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF  $163 MILLION  ,  $769 MILLION  , AND  $42 MILLION  AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  ,  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , AND  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR INVESTMENT POLICY IS DESIGNED TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL AND LIQUIDITY OF OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. THIS POLICY ALLOWS INVESTMENTS IN LARGE MONEY MARKET FUNDS OR IN HIGHLY RATED DIRECT SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS THAT MATURE IN 60 DAYS OR LESS. WE ALSO PLACE DOLLAR LIMITS ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL FUNDS OR INSTRUMENTS.  CAPITAL ALLOCATION  WE FOLLOW A DISCIPLINED AND BALANCED APPROACH TO CAPITAL ALLOCATION BASED ON THE FOLLOWING PRIORITIES, RANKED IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE: FIRST, WE FULLY INVEST IN OPPORTUNITIES TO PROFITABLY GROW OUR BUSINESS, CREATE SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM VALUE, AND MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS AND ASSETS; SECOND, WE MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AND SEEK TO GROW IT ANNUALLY; AND FINALLY, WE RETURN ANY EXCESS CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS BY REPURCHASING SHARES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF OUR CREDIT RATING GOALS.  WE EXPECT 2019 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $3.1 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $3.5 BILLION IN 2018.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS  OPERATING CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY CONTINUING OPERATIONS WAS  $4,141 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  $3,614 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  . THE OPERATING CASH FLOW INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET EARNINGS DURING THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  INVENTORY  INVENTORY WAS  $11,396 MILLION  AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  $9,497 MILLION  AND  $12,393 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , AND  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE FROM  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , REFLECTS THE SEASONAL INVENTORY BUILD AHEAD OF THE NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER HOLIDAY SALES PERIOD. INVENTORY LEVELS WERE LOWER AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, COMPARED WITH NOVEMBER 3, 2018, PARTIALLY DUE TO TIMING OF RECEIPTS BECAUSE THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY IS LATER IN THE CURRENT YEAR. IN ADDITION, ELEVATED INVENTORY LEVELS IN THE PRIOR YEAR REFLECTED INVESTMENTS IN TOYS AND BABY-RELATED MERCHANDISE.  DIVIDENDS  WE PAID DIVIDENDS TOTALING  $337 MILLION  (  $0.66  PER SHARE) AND  $995 MILLION  (  $1.94  PER SHARE) FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  $337 MILLION  (  $0.64  PER SHARE) AND  $1,001 MILLION  (  $1.88  PER SHARE) FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, A PER SHARE INCREASE OF  3.1  PERCENT AND 3.2 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY. WE DECLARED DIVIDENDS TOTALING  $338 MILLION  (  $0.66  PER SHARE) DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  , A PER SHARE INCREASE OF  3.1  PERCENT OVER THE  $338 MILLION  (  $0.64  PER SHARE) OF DECLARED DIVIDENDS DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2018  . WE HAVE PAID DIVIDENDS EVERY QUARTER SINCE OUR 1967 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING, AND IT IS OUR INTENT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE.  SHARE REPURCHASE  WE RETURNED  $294 MILLION  AND $912 MILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASE DURING THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. SEE PART II, ITEM 2 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION.  20  FINANCING  OUR FINANCING STRATEGY IS TO ENSURE LIQUIDITY AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, TO MAINTAIN A BALANCED SPECTRUM OF DEBT MATURITIES, AND TO MANAGE OUR NET EXPOSURE TO FLOATING INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY. WITHIN THESE PARAMETERS, WE SEEK TO MINIMIZE OUR BORROWING COSTS. OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE LONG-TERM DEBT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS HAS PROVIDED US WITH AMPLE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. OUR CONTINUED ACCESS TO THESE MARKETS DEPENDS ON MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING THE CONDITION OF DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND MAINTAINING STRONG CREDIT RATINGS. AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , OUR CREDIT RATINGS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  CREDIT RATINGS  MOODY\u2019S  STANDARD AND POOR\u2019S  FITCH  LONG-TERM DEBT  A2  A  A-  COMMERCIAL PAPER  P-1  A-1  F1  IF OUR CREDIT RATINGS WERE LOWERED, OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT MARKETS, OUR COST OF FUNDS, AND OTHER TERMS FOR NEW DEBT ISSUANCES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. EACH OF THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES REVIEWS ITS RATING PERIODICALLY AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS WILL REMAIN THE SAME AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. FITCH RAISED OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER RATING FROM F2 TO F1 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 3, 2019.  IN MARCH 2019, WE ISSUED  $1.0 BILLION  OF DEBT, AND IN JUNE 2019, WE REPAID  $1.0 BILLION  OF DEBT AT MATURITY. NOTES 5 AND 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  WE HAVE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY THROUGH A COMMITTED $2.5 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OBTAINED THROUGH A GROUP OF BANKS. IN OCTOBER 2018, WE EXTENDED THIS CREDIT FACILITY BY ONE YEAR TO OCTOBER 2023. NO BALANCES WERE OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME DURING  2019  OR  2018.  MOST OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS CONTAIN COVENANTS RELATED TO SECURED DEBT LEVELS. IN ADDITION TO A SECURED DEBT LEVEL COVENANT, OUR CREDIT FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS A DEBT LEVERAGE COVENANT. WE ARE, AND EXPECT TO REMAIN, IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , NO NOTES OR DEBENTURES CONTAINED PROVISIONS REQUIRING ACCELERATION OF PAYMENT UPON A CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE, EXCEPT THAT CERTAIN OUTSTANDING NOTES ALLOW THE NOTE HOLDERS TO PUT THE NOTES TO US IF WITHIN A MATTER OF MONTHS OF EACH OTHER WE EXPERIENCE BOTH (I) A CHANGE IN CONTROL; AND (II) OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ARE EITHER REDUCED AND THE RESULTING RATING IS NONINVESTMENT GRADE, OR OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ARE PLACED ON WATCH FOR POSSIBLE REDUCTION AND THOSE RATINGS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REDUCED AND THE RESULTING RATING IS NONINVESTMENT GRADE.  WE BELIEVE OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE ADEQUATE TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS, FINANCE ANTICIPATED EXPANSION AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, FUND DEBT MATURITIES, PAY DIVIDENDS, AND EXECUTE PURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE CONTINUE TO ANTICIPATE AMPLE ACCESS TO COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM FINANCING.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, OTHER THAN THE NEW BORROWINGS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS SINCE  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , AS REPORTED IN OUR  2018  FORM 10-K.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  21  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  THIS REPORT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY ACCOMPANIED BY THE WORDS \u201cEXPECT,\u201d \u201cMAY,\u201d \u201cCOULD,\u201d \u201cBELIEVE,\u201d \u201cWOULD,\u201d \u201cMIGHT,\u201d \u201cANTICIPATES,\u201d OR SIMILAR WORDS. THE PRINCIPAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT INCLUDE: OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, STATEMENTS REGARDING THE ADEQUACY OF AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, THE FUNDING OF DEBT MATURITIES, THE CONTINUED EXECUTION OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, OUR EXPECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND NEW LEASE COMMITMENTS, THE EXPECTED COMPLIANCE WITH DEBT COVENANTS, THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, OUR INTENTIONS REGARDING FUTURE DIVIDENDS, THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF, AND ADEQUACY OF OUR RESERVES FOR, CLAIMS, LITIGATION AND THE RESOLUTION OF TAX MATTERS, THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS.  ALL SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE INTENDED TO ENJOY THE PROTECTION OF THE SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995, AS AMENDED. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THERE IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT. THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS WHICH COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SET FORTH ON OUR DESCRIPTION OF RISK FACTORS IN ITEM 1A OF OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , WHICH SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE MADE, AND WE DO NOT UNDERTAKE ANY OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "TARGET CORP", "CIK": 27419, "Date": "2019-11-27T00:00:00", "Ticker": "TGT", "Name": "Target Corp", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 5331.0, "Business": "MN", "Incorporated": "MN", "IRS": 410215170.0, "key": "20191127TGT", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": -0.7069102462271649, "labelr3": -0.8239340852731791, "labelr4": 0.04839490240361532, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.49144673, "prof1": 0.50855327, "return1&2": 0.9929308975377285, "return1&2&3": 0.9847498014297059, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9852263701350278, "return2": 0.9929308975377285, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 0.9917606591472682, "return4": 1.0004839490240365, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.07584098673541284, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3475, "returnpred": 0.0, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0, "cumreturn1b": 1.0248909955177268, "cumreturn1c": 1.0864197598363001, "cumreturndow": 1.0282760085846303, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0298617725317403}]}}, {"mode": "vega-lite"});

THE FOLLOWING SECTION IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY THE MORE  DETAILED INFORMATION, INCLUDING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO, WHICH APPEARS ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT.  19  OVERVIEW  WE  ARE A WELL-KNOWN INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURER AND MAKER OF HIGHLY ENGINEERED PRECISION BEARINGS AND COMPONENTS. OUR PRECISION SOLUTIONS  ARE INTEGRAL TO THE MANUFACTURE AND OPERATION OF MOST MACHINES AND MECHANICAL SYSTEMS, REDUCE WEAR TO MOVING PARTS, FACILITATE  PROPER POWER TRANSMISSION AND REDUCE DAMAGE AND ENERGY LOSS CAUSED BY FRICTION. WHILE WE MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS IN ALL MAJOR BEARINGS  CATEGORIES, WE FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE HIGHER END OF THE BEARING AND ENGINEERED COMPONENT MARKETS WHERE WE BELIEVE OUR VALUE ADDED  MANUFACTURING AND ENGINEERING CAPABILITIES ENABLE US TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES FROM OUR COMPETITORS AND ENHANCE PROFITABILITY.  WE BELIEVE OUR UNIQUE EXPERTISE HAS ENABLED US TO GARNER LEADING POSITIONS IN MANY OF THE PRODUCT MARKETS IN WHICH WE PRIMARILY  COMPETE. WITH 43 FACILITIES, OF WHICH 33 ARE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN FOUR COUNTRIES, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY BROADEN  OUR END MARKETS, PRODUCTS, CUSTOMER BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC REACH. WE CURRENTLY OPERATE UNDER FOUR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: PLAIN  BEARINGS; ROLLER BEARINGS; BALL BEARINGS; AND ENGINEERED PRODUCTS. THE FOLLOWING FURTHER DESCRIBES THESE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.  PLAIN  BEARINGS.  PLAIN BEARINGS ARE PRODUCED WITH EITHER SELF-LUBRICATING OR METAL-TO-METAL DESIGNS AND CONSISTS OF SEVERAL SUB-CLASSES,  INCLUDING ROD END BEARINGS, SPHERICAL PLAIN BEARINGS AND JOURNAL BEARINGS. UNLIKE BALL BEARINGS, WHICH ARE USED IN HIGH-SPEED  ROTATIONAL APPLICATIONS, PLAIN BEARINGS ARE PRIMARILY USED TO RECTIFY INEVITABLE MISALIGNMENTS IN VARIOUS MECHANICAL COMPONENTS.  ROLLER  BEARINGS.  ROLLER BEARINGS ARE ANTI-FRICTION BEARINGS THAT USE ROLLERS INSTEAD OF BALLS. WE MANUFACTURE FOUR BASIC TYPES  OF ROLLER BEARINGS: HEAVY-DUTY NEEDLE ROLLER BEARINGS WITH INNER RINGS, TAPERED ROLLER BEARINGS, TRACK ROLLERS AND AIRCRAFT ROLLER  BEARINGS.  BALL  BEARINGS  . WE MANUFACTURE FOUR BASIC TYPES OF BALL BEARINGS: HIGH PRECISION AEROSPACE, AIRFRAME CONTROL, THIN SECTION AND  COMMERCIAL BALL BEARINGS WHICH ARE USED IN HIGH-SPEED ROTATIONAL APPLICATIONS.  ENGINEERED  PRODUCTS.  ENGINEERED PRODUCTS CONSISTS OF HIGHLY ENGINEERED HYDRAULICS, FASTENERS, COLLETS AND PRECISION COMPONENTS USED  IN AEROSPACE, MARINE AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS.  PURCHASERS  OF BEARINGS AND ENGINEERED PRODUCTS INCLUDE INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT AND MACHINERY MANUFACTURERS, PRODUCERS OF COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY  AEROSPACE EQUIPMENT SUCH AS MISSILES AND RADAR SYSTEMS, AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY MANUFACTURERS, CONSTRUCTION, ENERGY, MINING, MARINE  AND SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS, MARINE PRODUCTS, AUTOMOTIVE AND COMMERCIAL TRUCK MANUFACTURERS. THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS  ARE CYCLICAL, AND WE HAVE ENDEAVORED TO MITIGATE THIS CYCLICALITY BY ENTERING INTO SOLE-SOURCE RELATIONSHIPS AND LONG-TERM PURCHASE  AGREEMENTS, THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION ACROSS MULTIPLE MARKET SEGMENTS WITHIN THE AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE AND DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIAL  SEGMENTS, BY INCREASING SALES TO THE AFTERMARKET AND BY FOCUSING ON DEVELOPING HIGHLY CUSTOMIZED SOLUTIONS.  20  CURRENTLY,  OUR STRATEGY IS BUILT AROUND MAINTAINING OUR ROLE AS A LEADING MANUFACTURER OF PRECISION-ENGINEERED BEARINGS AND COMPONENTS THROUGH  THE FOLLOWING EFFORTS.  \u25cf  DEVELOPING  INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS.  BY LEVERAGING OUR DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING EXPERTISE AND  OUR EXTENSIVE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS FOR MARKETS  IN WHICH THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES.  \u25cf  EXPANDING  CUSTOMER BASE AND PENETRATING END MARKETS.  WE CONTINUALLY SEEK OPPORTUNITIES  TO ACCESS NEW CUSTOMERS, GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS AND BEARING PLATFORMS WITH EXISTING PRODUCTS  OR PROFITABLE NEW PRODUCT OPPORTUNITIES.  \u25cf  INCREASING  AFTERMARKET SALES.  WE BELIEVE THAT INCREASING OUR AFTERMARKET SALES OF REPLACEMENT  PARTS WILL FURTHER ENHANCE THE CONTINUITY AND PREDICTABILITY OF OUR REVENUES AND ENHANCE  OUR PROFITABILITY. SUCH SALES INCLUDE SALES TO THIRD PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND SALES TO  OEMS FOR REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS AND AFTERMARKET SERVICES. WE WILL INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE  OF OUR REVENUES DERIVED FROM THE REPLACEMENT MARKET BY CONTINUING TO IMPLEMENT SEVERAL  INITIATIVES.  \u25cf  PURSUING  SELECTIVE ACQUISITIONS.  THE ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES THAT COMPLEMENT OR EXPAND  OUR OPERATIONS HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY.  WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THE INDUSTRY THAT MAY  PRESENT US WITH ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES.  OUTLOOK  OUR NET SALES FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 28, 2019 INCREASED 5.2% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST FISCAL YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS A RESULT OF A 10.2% INCREASE IN AEROSPACE SALES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF 2.8% IN INDUSTRIAL SALES.  EXCLUDING $3.9 MILLION OF SALES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MIAMI DIVISION SOLD IN FISCAL 2019, AEROSPACE SALES INCREASED 14.4% YEAR OVER YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN AEROSPACE MARKETS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMMERCIAL AND DEFENSE OEM AND AFTERMARKET BUSINESS.

OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE HISTORICALLY  FUELED OUR GROWTH IN PART THROUGH ACQUISITIONS. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY MET OUR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS  AND ACQUISITION FUNDING NEEDS THROUGH OUR NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS, VARIOUS DEBT ARRANGEMENTS AND SALE OF EQUITY  TO INVESTORS. WE BELIEVE THAT OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND AVAILABLE CREDIT UNDER THE REVOLVER  AND FOREIGN REVOLVER WILL PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO  FUND INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL GROWTH INITIATIVES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  OUR  ABILITY TO MEET FUTURE WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL  PERFORMANCE, WHICH WILL BE AFFECTED BY A RANGE OF ECONOMIC, COMPETITIVE AND BUSINESS FACTORS, PARTICULARLY INTEREST RATES, CYCLICAL  CHANGES IN OUR END MARKETS AND PRICES FOR STEEL AND OUR ABILITY TO PASS THROUGH PRICE INCREASES ON A TIMELY BASIS, MANY OF WHICH  ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. IN ADDITION, FUTURE ACQUISITIONS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AND OUR  NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS.  FROM  TIME TO TIME, WE EVALUATE OUR EXISTING FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS AND THEIR STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE TO US. IF WE DETERMINE THAT A  GIVEN FACILITY OR OPERATION DOES NOT HAVE FUTURE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE, WE MAY SELL, PARTIALLY OR COMPLETELY, RELOCATE PRODUCTION  LINES, CONSOLIDATE OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF THOSE OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR OPERATIONS WOULD NOT BE MATERIALLY IMPAIRED  BY SUCH DISPOSITIONS, RELOCATIONS OR CONSOLIDATIONS, WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT CASH OR NON-CASH CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH THEM.  LIQUIDITY  AS  OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2019, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $36.4 MILLION OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $18.2 MILLION WAS CASH HELD BY  OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS WILL BE RE-INVESTED INDEFINITELY FOR WORKING CAPITAL,  INTERNAL GROWTH AND ACQUISITIONS FOR AND BY OUR FOREIGN ENTITIES.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2019, APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION IN UNAMORTIZED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS  REMAIN.

THE INCREASE OF $6.7 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2020 WAS MAINLY A RESULT OF THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF  THE NET CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $3.8 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN NET INCOME OF $4.2 MILLION OFFSET BY NON-CASH  CHARGES OF $1.3 MILLION. THE FAVORABLE CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN THE  AMOUNT OF CASH BEING PROVIDED BY WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS AS DETAILED IN THE TABLE BELOW, WHILE THE REDUCTION OF NON-CASH CHARGES  RESULTED FROM A DECREASE OF $2.5 MILLION IN DEFERRED TAXES, $0.3 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS, $1.0 MILLION  FROM EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, AND $0.3 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION OF $0.7  MILLION, $2.0 MILLION OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION CHARGES, AND $0.1 MILLION OF OTHER NON-CASH CHARGES.

THIS INCREASE IN CASH  USED WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE $33.8 MILLION ACQUISITION OF SWISS TOOL IN FISCAL 2020, AN INCREASE OF $2.5 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  AND A REDUCTION OF $1.6 MILLION IN PROCEEDS RECEIVED IN FISCAL 2020 FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS.  DURING FISCAL 2020, WE USED $5.0 MILLION  FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO USING $34.4 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2019. THIS DECREASE IN CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE  TO PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM BORROWINGS OF $24.8 MILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SWISS TOOL AND $20.0 MILLION LESS PAYMENTS MADE ON  OUTSTANDING DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $8.9 MILLION FEWER PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS, $6.3 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL TREASURY  STOCK PURCHASES, AND $0.2 MILLION OF FINANCE FEES PAID IN CONNECTION WITH THE CREDIT FACILITIES.  33  CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES  OUR  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $20.2 MILLION FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 28, 2019. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT TO MAKE ADDITIONAL  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $12.0 TO $17.0 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2020 IN CONNECTION WITH OUR EXISTING BUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO FUND  FISCAL 2020 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH EXISTING CASH AND INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS. WE MAY ALSO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL  ADDITIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS.  OTHER  MATTERS  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  PREPARATION  OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS,  LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES. WE BELIEVE THE MOST COMPLEX AND SENSITIVE JUDGMENTS, BECAUSE OF THEIR SIGNIFICANCE TO THE  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, RESULT PRIMARILY FROM THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY  UNCERTAIN.

IN THIS MD&A, \"MASONITE,\" \"WE,\" \"US,\" \"OUR\" AND THE \"COMPANY\" REFER TO MASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.  THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH (I) THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND (II) THE ANNUAL AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES AND MD&A, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2018. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD ALSO BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DISCLOSURE UNDER \"SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\" ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT BASIS OF PRESENTATION.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING GLOBAL DESIGNER, MANUFACTURER AND DISTRIBUTOR OF INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR DOORS FOR THE NEW CONSTRUCTION AND REPAIR, RENOVATION AND REMODELING SECTORS OF THE RESIDENTIAL AND THE NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION MARKETS. SINCE 1925, WE HAVE PROVIDED OUR CUSTOMERS WITH INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SUPERIOR SERVICE AT COMPELLING VALUES. IN ORDER TO BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND CREATE SUSTAINABLE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES, WE FOCUS ON DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, ADVANCED MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN SALES AND SERVICE SOLUTIONS.  WE MARKET AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO REMODELING CONTRACTORS, BUILDERS, HOMEOWNERS, RETAILERS, DEALERS, LUMBERYARDS, COMMERCIAL AND GENERAL CONTRACTORS AND ARCHITECTS THROUGH WELL-ESTABLISHED WHOLESALE, RETAIL AND DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AS PART OF OUR CROSS-MERCHANDISING STRATEGY. CUSTOMERS ARE PROVIDED A BROAD PRODUCT OFFERING OF INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR DOORS AND ENTRY SYSTEMS AT VARIOUS PRICE POINTS. WE MANUFACTURE A BROAD LINE OF INTERIOR DOORS, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL MOLDED, FLUSH, STILE AND RAIL, LOUVER AND SPECIALLY-ORDERED COMMERCIAL AND ARCHITECTURAL DOORS; DOOR COMPONENTS FOR INTERNAL USE AND SALE TO OTHER DOOR MANUFACTURERS; AND EXTERIOR RESIDENTIAL STEEL, FIBERGLASS AND WOOD DOORS AND ENTRY SYSTEMS.  WE OPERATE 67 MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES IN 8 COUNTRIES IN NORTH AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND ASIA, WHICH ARE STRATEGICALLY LOCATED TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THESE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS INCLUDE: (I) DIRECT DISTRIBUTION TO RETAIL HOME CENTER CUSTOMERS AND HOMEBUILDERS; (II) ONE-STEP DISTRIBUTION THAT SELLS DIRECTLY TO HOMEBUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS; AND (III) TWO-STEP DISTRIBUTION THROUGH WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS. FOR RETAIL HOME CENTER CUSTOMERS, NUMEROUS DOOR FABRICATION FACILITIES PROVIDE VALUE-ADDED FABRICATION AND LOGISTICAL SERVICES, INCLUDING PRE-FINISHING AND STORE DELIVERY OF PRE-HUNG INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR DOORS. WE BELIEVE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE: (I) A BROAD PRODUCT RANGE; (II) FREQUENT, RAPID, ON-TIME AND COMPLETE DELIVERY; (III) CONSISTENCY IN PRODUCTS AND MERCHANDISING; (IV) NATIONAL SERVICE; AND (V) SPECIAL ORDER PROGRAMS ENABLES RETAIL CUSTOMERS TO INCREASE COMPARABLE STORE SALES AND HELPS TO DIFFERENTIATE US FROM OUR COMPETITORS. WE BELIEVE INVESTMENTS IN INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES, COUPLED WITH AN ONGOING COMMITMENT TO OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, PROVIDE A STRONG PLATFORM FOR FUTURE GROWTH.  OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE ORGANIZED AND MANAGED PRINCIPALLY BY END MARKET: NORTH AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL, EUROPE AND ARCHITECTURAL. IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, WE GENERATED NET SALES OF $1,107.2 MILLION OR 67.3%, $241.2 MILLION OR 14.7% AND $279.3 MILLION OR 17.0% IN OUR NORTH AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL, EUROPE AND ARCHITECTURAL SEGMENTS, RESPECTIVELY.  KEY FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  PRODUCT DEMAND  THERE ARE NUMEROUS FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE OVERALL MARKET DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. DEMAND FOR NEW HOMES, HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS AND OTHER BUILDING CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN UNITED STATES, CANADIAN, EUROPEAN, ASIAN OR OTHER GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING INFLATION, DEFLATION, INTEREST RATES, AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL, CONSUMER  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION  SPENDING RATES, ENERGY AVAILABILITY AND COSTS, AND THE EFFECTS OF GOVERNMENTAL INITIATIVES TO MANAGE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, TRENDS IN RESIDENTIAL NEW CONSTRUCTION, REPAIR, RENOVATION AND REMODELING AND ARCHITECTURAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION MAY DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. ACCORDINGLY, THE FOLLOWING FACTORS MAY HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS IN THE COUNTRIES AND REGIONS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD.  \u2022  THE STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY;  \u2022  THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION;  \u2022  HOUSING SALES AND HOME VALUES;  \u2022  THE AGE OF EXISTING HOME STOCK, HOME VACANCY RATES AND FORECLOSURES;  \u2022  NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDING OCCUPANCY RATES;  \u2022  INCREASES IN THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS OR WAGES OR ANY SHORTAGE IN SUPPLIES OR LABOR;  \u2022  THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CREDIT;  \u2022  EMPLOYMENT RATES AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE; AND  \u2022  DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS IMMIGRATION AND MIGRATION OF THE POPULATION AND TRENDS IN HOUSEHOLD FORMATION.  ADDITIONALLY, THE UNITED KINGDOM'S (\"UK\") ANTICIPATED EXIT FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION (\"EU\") (\"BREXIT\") HAS CREATED UNCERTAINTY IN EUROPEAN DEMAND, PARTICULARLY IN THE UK, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE ANTICIPATED EXIT HAS BEEN POSTPONED AND THE NEW DEADLINE IS CURRENTLY JANUARY 31, 2020.  PRODUCT PRICING AND MIX  THE BUILDING PRODUCTS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND WE THEREFORE FACE PRESSURE ON SALES PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, OUR COMPETITORS MAY ADOPT MORE AGGRESSIVE SALES POLICIES AND DEVOTE GREATER RESOURCES TO THE DEVELOPMENT, PROMOTION AND SALE OF THEIR PRODUCTS THAN WE DO, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF CUSTOMERS. OUR BUSINESS IN GENERAL IS SUBJECT TO CHANGING CONSUMER AND INDUSTRY TRENDS, DEMANDS AND PREFERENCES. TRENDS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY CHANGE OFTEN AND OUR FAILURE TO ANTICIPATE, IDENTIFY OR QUICKLY REACT TO CHANGES IN THESE TRENDS COULD LEAD TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REJECTION OF A NEW PRODUCT LINE AND REDUCED DEMAND AND PRICE REDUCTIONS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT US. CHANGES IN CONSUMER PREFERENCES MAY ALSO LEAD TO INCREASED DEMAND FOR OUR LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS RELATIVE TO OUR HIGHER MARGIN PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.  ON OCTOBER 30, 2019, WE COMMUNICATED PRICE INCREASES THAT BECOME EFFECTIVE ON FEBRUARY 3, 2020, TO OUR NORTH AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS THAT, FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS, WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN OUR TYPICAL ANNUAL INCREASES. WE ALSO COMMUNICATED OUR INTENT TO INCREMENTALLY INVEST $100 MILLION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IN THE AREAS OF SERVICE AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS, PRODUCT INNOVATION AND END USER MARKETING. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THESE INITIATIVES ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE PROFILE OF, AND DEMAND FOR, OUR PRODUCTS AND THAT THEY WILL BENEFIT BOTH US AND OUR CUSTOMERS, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OUR EFFORTS WILL ULTIMATELY BE SUCCESSFUL OR HOW OUR CUSTOMERS WILL REACT TO THESE INITIATIVES WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FUTURE PERIODS.  BUSINESS WINS AND LOSSES  OUR CUSTOMERS CONSIST MAINLY OF WHOLESALERS AND RETAIL HOME CENTERS. IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, OUR TOP TEN CUSTOMERS TOGETHER ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 44% OF OUR NET SALES AND OUR TOP CUSTOMER, THE HOME DEPOT, INC. ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 18% OF OUR NET SALES. NET SALES FROM CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR NET SALES IN PAST PERIODS, INDIVIDUALLY OR AS A GROUP, MAY NOT CONTINUE IN FUTURE PERIODS, OR IF CONTINUED, MAY NOT REACH OR EXCEED HISTORICAL LEVELS IN ANY PERIOD. CERTAIN CUSTOMERS PERFORM PERIODIC PRODUCT LINE REVIEWS TO ASSESS THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WHICH HAVE, ON PAST OCCASIONS, LED TO BUSINESS WINS AND LOSSES. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF COMPETITIVE BIDDING PROCESSES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO INCREASE OR MAINTAIN THE MARGINS AT WHICH WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS.  ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING  OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE ENGAGED IN A SERIES OF RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS RELATED TO EXITING CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES AND NON-CORE BUSINESSES, CONSOLIDATING CERTAIN INTERNAL SUPPORT FUNCTIONS AND ENGAGING IN OTHER ACTIONS DESIGNED TO REDUCE OUR COST STRUCTURE AND IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY. THESE INITIATIVES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF SEVERANCE ACTIONS AND LEASE TERMINATION COSTS. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS; THEREFORE, IN FUTURE YEARS, THERE MAY BE ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR NEW PLAN INITIATIVES, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN PREVIOUSLY RECORDED ESTIMATES, AS PAYMENTS ARE MADE  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION  OR ACTIONS ARE COMPLETED. ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE ALSO INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS FOR THOSE ASSETS SOLD, ABANDONED OR MADE OBSOLETE AS A RESULT OF THESE PROGRAMS.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE BEGAN IMPLEMENTING A PLAN TO IMPROVE OVERALL BUSINESS PERFORMANCE THAT INCLUDES THE REORGANIZATION OF OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY AND A REDUCTION OF OUR OVERHEAD AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION WORKFORCE ACROSS ALL OF OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND IN OUR HEAD OFFICES. THE REORGANIZATION OF OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY INVOLVES SPECIFIC PLANTS IN THE NORTH AMERICAN RESIDENTIAL AND ARCHITECTURAL SEGMENTS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSURE OF THESE PLANTS AND RELATED HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS BEGAN TAKING PLACE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 (COLLECTIVELY, THE \"2019 PLAN\"). COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2019 PLAN INCLUDE SEVERANCE, RETENTION AND CLOSURE CHARGES AND WILL CONTINUE THROUGH 2020. ADDITIONALLY, THE PLAN TO DIVEST NON-CORE ASSETS WAS DETERMINED TO BE A TRIGGERING EVENT REQUIRING A TEST OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE DEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS RELATING TO THE DIVESTITURES, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 13. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, WE EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $8 MILLION TO $10 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CHARGES RELATED TO THE 2019 PLAN. ONCE FULLY IMPLEMENTED, THE ACTIONS TAKEN AS PART OF THE 2019 PLAN ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE OUR ANNUAL EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS BY APPROXIMATELY $14 MILLION TO $19 MILLION.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WE BEGAN IMPLEMENTING A PLAN TO REORGANIZE AND CONSOLIDATE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR UNITED KINGDOM HEAD OFFICE FUNCTION AND OPTIMIZE OUR PORTFOLIO BY DIVESTING NON-CORE ASSETS TO ENABLE MORE EFFECTIVE AND CONSISTENT BUSINESS PROCESSES IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, IN THE NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT WE ANNOUNCED A NEW FACILITY THAT WILL OPTIMIZE AND EXPAND CAPACITY THROUGH INCREASED AUTOMATION, WHICH RESULTED IN THE CLOSURE OF ONE EXISTING FACILITY AND RELATED HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 (COLLECTIVELY, THE \"2018 PLAN\"). COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2018 PLAN INCLUDE SEVERANCE, RETENTION AND CLOSURE CHARGES AND WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT 2019. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, WE EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CHARGES RELATED TO THE 2018 PLAN. ONCE FULLY IMPLEMENTED, THE ACTIONS TAKEN AS PART OF THE 2018 PLAN ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE OUR ANNUAL EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS BY APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATION  OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FLUCTUATING EXCHANGE RATES. IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, APPROXIMATELY 32% OF OUR NET SALES WERE GENERATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR COSTS DURING THE SAME PERIOD WERE NOT DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. FOR EXAMPLE, FOR MOST OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, THE PRICES FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR RAW MATERIALS ARE QUOTED IN THE DOMESTIC CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE FACILITY IS LOCATED OR OTHER CURRENCIES THAT ARE NOT U.S. DOLLARS. WE ALSO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL ASSETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, THE VOLATILITY IN THE PRICE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR HAS EXPOSED, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY CONTINUE TO EXPOSE, US TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS. ALSO, SINCE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS, CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND OTHER CURRENCIES HAVE HAD, AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE, AN IMPACT ON MANY ASPECTS OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES FOR ANY COUNTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE MAY REQUIRE US TO RAISE THE PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THAT COUNTRY OR ALLOW OUR COMPETITORS TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS AT LOWER PRICES IN THAT COUNTRY. UNREALIZED EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM THE TRANSLATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF OUR NON-U.S. FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OPERATIONS ARE ACCUMULATED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ACCOUNT IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).  SINCE THE UK TRIGGERED BREXIT, THERE HAS BEEN INSTABILITY IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS, INCLUDING VOLATILITY IN THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE POUND STERLING TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. THE AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE POUND STERLING TO THE U.S. DOLLAR DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, WAS 6% LOWER THAN THE AVERAGE FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, WHICH HAS IMPACTED OUR NET SALES AND NET INCOME IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT. FUTURE VOLATILITY IN THE POUND STERLING COULD CONTINUE AS THE TERMS OF THE UK'S ANTICIPATED EXIT FROM THE EU REMAIN UNCERTAIN. CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT IN PLACE FOR THE UK TO EXIT THE EU THAT HAS BEEN RATIFIED BY BRITISH PARLIAMENT. IF THE UK EXITS THE EU WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT IN PLACE, IT WILL LIKELY CREATE FURTHER UNCERTAINTY AND CURRENCY VOLATILITY, WHICH MAY INCREASE THE COST OF GOODS IMPORTED INTO OUR UK OPERATIONS OR DECREASE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR UK OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, SINCE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS, VOLATILITY IN THE POUND STERLING AFFECTS OUR REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOWS. IN THE LONGER TERM, ANY IMPACT FROM BREXIT ON OUR UK OPERATIONS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE OUTCOME OF TARIFF, TRADE, REGULATORY AND OTHER NEGOTIATIONS.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION  INFLATION  AN INCREASE IN INFLATION COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COST OF OUR RAW MATERIAL INPUTS. WAGE INFLATION, INCREASED PRICES FOR RAW MATERIALS OR FINISHED GOODS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS, TARIFFS AND/OR INTERRUPTIONS IN DELIVERIES OF RAW MATERIALS OR FINISHED GOODS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY, MARGINS AND NET SALES, PARTICULARLY IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PASS THESE INCURRED COSTS ON TO OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, INTEREST RATES NORMALLY INCREASE DURING PERIODS OF RISING INFLATION. HISTORICALLY, AS INTEREST RATES INCREASE, DEMAND FOR NEW HOMES AND HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS DECREASES.  SEASONALITY  OUR BUSINESS IS MODERATELY SEASONAL AND OUR NET SALES VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER BASED UPON THE TIMING OF THE BUILDING SEASON IN OUR MARKETS. SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS IN ANY QUARTER, SUCH AS UNUSUALLY PROLONGED WARM OR COLD CONDITIONS, RAIN, BLIZZARDS OR HURRICANES, COULD ACCELERATE, DELAY OR HALT CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION ACTIVITY.  ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITION  WE HAVE PURSUED A STRATEGIC INITIATIVE OF OPTIMIZING OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS PORTFOLIO. AS PART OF THIS STRATEGY, IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE PURSUED STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS TARGETING COMPANIES WHO PRODUCE COMPONENTS FOR OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS, MANUFACTURE NICHE PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE VALUE-ADDED SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, WE TARGET COMPANIES WITH STRONG BRANDS, COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES, ATTRACTIVE GEOGRAPHIC FOOTPRINTS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR COST AND DISTRIBUTION SYNERGIES. WE ALSO CONTINUOUSLY ANALYZE OUR OPERATIONS TO DETERMINE WHICH BUSINESSES, MARKET CHANNELS AND PRODUCTS CREATE THE MOST VALUE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND ACCEPTABLE RETURNS FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  ACQUISITIONS  \u2022  TOP DOORS  .  ON AUGUST 29, 2019, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF TOPDOORS, S.R.O. (\"TOP DOORS\") BASED IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC FOR CASH CONSIDERATION OF $1.6 MILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED. TOP DOORS IS A SPECIALIST MANUFACTURER OF DOOR FRAMES.  \u2022  BWI.  ON NOVEMBER 1, 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF THE OPERATING ASSETS OF BRIDGEWATER WHOLESALERS INC. (\"BWI\") FOR CASH CONSIDERATION OF $22.3 MILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED. BWI IS HEADQUARTERED IN BRANCHBURG, NEW JERSEY, AND IS A FABRICATOR AND DISTRIBUTOR OF RESIDENTIAL INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR DOOR SYSTEMS, SUPPORTING CUSTOMERS IN THE MID-ATLANTIC AND NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS INCLUDE RESIDENTIAL INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR DOORS, COMMERCIAL DOORS AND HARDWARE AS WELL AS VALUE ADDED PRE-FINISHING SERVICES.  \u2022  GRAHAM AND MAIMAN.  ON JUNE 1, 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF THE OPERATING ASSETS OF THE WOOD DOOR COMPANIES OF AADG, INC., INCLUDING THE BRANDS GRAHAM MANUFACTURING CORPORATION AND THE MAIMAN COMPANY (COLLECTIVELY, \"GRAHAM & MAIMAN\"). WE ACQUIRED THE OPERATING ASSETS OF GRAHAM & MAIMAN FOR CASH CONSIDERATION OF $39.0 MILLION. GRAHAM & MAIMAN ARE BASED IN MASON CITY, IOWA, AND SPRINGFIELD, MISSOURI. GRAHAM & MAIMAN PROVIDE THE NON-RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WITH A FULL RANGE OF ARCHITECTURAL PREMIUM AND CUSTOM GRADE FLUSH WOOD DOORS, ARCHITECTURAL STILE AND RAIL WOOD DOORS, THERMAL-FUSED FLUSH WOOD DOORS AND WOOD DOOR FRAMES.  \u2022  DW3.  ON JANUARY 29, 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF DW3 PRODUCTS HOLDINGS LIMITED (\"DW3\"), A LEADING UK PROVIDER OF HIGH QUALITY PREMIUM DOOR SOLUTIONS AND WINDOW SYSTEMS, SUPPLYING PRODUCTS UNDER BRAND NAMES SUCH AS SOLIDOR, RESIDOR, NICEDOR AND RESIDENCE. WE ACQUIRED 100% OF THE EQUITY INTERESTS IN DW3 FOR CASH CONSIDERATION OF $96.3 MILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED. DW3 IS BASED IN STOKE-ON-TRENT AND GLOUCESTER, ENGLAND, AND THEIR ONLINE QUICK SHIP CAPABILITIES AND PRODUCT PORTFOLIO BOTH COMPLEMENT AND EXPAND THE STRATEGIES WE ARE PURSUING WITH OUR BUSINESS.  DISPOSITION  \u2022  PDS.  ON MARCH 21, 2019, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF ALL OF THE CAPITAL STOCK OF PERFORMANCE DOORSET SOLUTIONS LIMITED (\"PDS\") FOR NOMINAL CONSIDERATION. THE DISPOSITION OF THIS BUSINESS RESULTED IN A LOSS ON DECONSOLIDATION OF $4.6 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECOGNIZED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION  COMPONENTS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED \"COMPONENTS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2018.

THE ALLOCATIONS GENERALLY CONSIST OF CERTAIN COSTS OF HUMAN RESOURCES, LEGAL, FINANCE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS FOR OPERATIONS VARY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, THE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR ABL FACILITY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SALES PROGRAM WITH A THIRD PARTY (\"AR SALES PROGRAM\") AND OUR EXISTING CASH BALANCE. OUR ANTICIPATED USES OF CASH IN THE NEAR TERM INCLUDE WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND SHARE REPURCHASES. ON A CONTINUAL BASIS, WE EVALUATE AND CONSIDER STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, AND JOINT VENTURES TO CREATE SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND ENHANCE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH BALANCE ON HAND, FUTURE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, THE USE OF OUR AR SALES PROGRAM, OUR ABL FACILITY, AND ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS WILL PROVIDE ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, WE HAD $110.0 MILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR ABL FACILITY OF $187.0 MILLION AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR AR SALES PROGRAM OF $14.6 MILLION.  CASH FLOWS  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $138.4 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, COMPARED TO $140.5 MILLION IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THIS $2.1 MILLION DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO A $1.8 MILLION DECREASE IN OUR NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO MASONITE, ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH AND NON-OPERATING ITEMS AND CHANGES IN NET WORKING CAPITAL IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $59.1 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, COMPARED TO $188.0 MILLION IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THIS $128.9 MILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS OF $133.4 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $4.3 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND A NET INCREASE IN OTHER INVESTING OUTFLOWS OF $0.2 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $84.1 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED OF $63.4 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THIS $147.5 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS DRIVEN BY A NET INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR DEBT-RELATED TRANSACTIONS OF $186.0 MILLION PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $36.1 MILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR REPURCHASES OF COMMON SHARES, A $2.1 MILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR TAX WITHHOLDING ON SHARE BASED AWARDS AND A DECREASE IN OTHER FINANCING OUTFLOWS OF $0.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  SHARE REPURCHASES  WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN PLACE A $600 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION, STEMMING FROM THREE SEPARATE AUTHORIZATIONS BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ON FEBRUARY 23, 2016, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHEREBY WE MAY REPURCHASE UP TO $150 MILLION WORTH OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES AND ON FEBRUARY 22, 2017, AND MAY 10, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL $200 MILLION AND $250 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY (COLLECTIVELY, THE \"SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS\"). THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS HAVE NO SPECIFIED END DATE AND THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF ANY SHARE REPURCHASES WILL BE DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT BASED ON OUR EVALUATION OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. ANY REPURCHASES UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS MAY BE MADE IN THE OPEN MARKET, IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS OR OTHERWISE, SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS, APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS DO NOT OBLIGATE US TO ACQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR AMOUNT OF COMMON SHARES, AND THEY MAY BE SUSPENDED OR TERMINATED AT ANY TIME AT OUR DISCRETION. REPURCHASES UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION  ARE PERMITTED TO BE MADE UNDER ONE OR MORE RULE 10B5-1 PLANS, WHICH WOULD PERMIT SHARES TO BE REPURCHASED WHEN WE MIGHT OTHERWISE BE PRECLUDED FROM DOING SO UNDER APPLICABLE INSIDER TRADING LAWS. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 1,148,815 OF OUR COMMON SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET AT AN AGGREGATE COST OF $58.4 MILLION AS PART OF THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WE REPURCHASED 1,464,700 OF OUR COMMON SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET AT AN AGGREGATE COST OF $94.5 MILLION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, THERE WAS $145.6 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS.  OTHER LIQUIDITY MATTERS  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE INCLUDES CASH HELD IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. CASH HELD OUTSIDE CANADA, IN WHICH WE ARE INCORPORATED, IS FREE FROM SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT THE CASH FROM BEING ACCESSED TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS INCLUDING, IF NECESSARY, TO FUND OPERATIONS AND SERVICE DEBT OBLIGATIONS IN CANADA. HOWEVER, EARNINGS FROM CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS ARE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS. UPON THE REPATRIATION OF ANY EARNINGS TO CANADA, IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR OTHERWISE, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CANADIAN INCOME TAXES AND WITHHOLDING TAXES PAYABLE TO THE VARIOUS FOREIGN COUNTRIES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, WE DO NOT BELIEVE ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES EXIST THAT RESTRICT OUR USE OF CASH OR CASH EQUIVALENTS IN A MATERIAL MANNER.  WE ALSO ROUTINELY MONITOR THE CHANGES IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THERE HAS NOT BEEN A CHANGE IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF A CUSTOMER THAT HAS HAD A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WERE TO DETERIORATE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD BE AN IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A FUTURE PERIOD AND THIS IMPACT COULD BE MATERIAL.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SALES PROGRAM  WE MAINTAIN AN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SALES PROGRAM WITH A THIRD PARTY (THE \"AR SALES PROGRAM\"). UNDER THE AR SALES PROGRAM, WE CAN TRANSFER OWNERSHIP OF ELIGIBLE TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF CERTAIN CUSTOMERS. RECEIVABLES ARE SOLD OUTRIGHT TO A THIRD PARTY THAT ASSUMES THE FULL RISK OF COLLECTION, WITHOUT RECOURSE TO US IN THE EVENT OF A LOSS. TRANSFERS OF RECEIVABLES UNDER THIS PROGRAM ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SALES. PROCEEDS FROM THE TRANSFERS REFLECT THE FACE VALUE OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE LESS A DISCOUNT. RECEIVABLES SOLD UNDER THE AR SALES PROGRAM ARE EXCLUDED FROM TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND ARE INCLUDED IN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. THE DISCOUNTS ON THE SALES OF TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SOLD UNDER THE AR SALES PROGRAM WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED AND WERE RECORDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION EXPENSE WITHIN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

ABL FACILITY  ON JANUARY 31, 2019, WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AMENDED AND RESTATED OUR ASSET-BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \"ABL FACILITY\") IN ORDER TO EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE OF THE ABL FACILITY AND AMEND CERTAIN OTHER PROVISIONS. THE AMENDED AND RESTATED ABL FACILITY INCREASED THE REVOLVING COMMITMENTS TO $250.0 MILLION FROM $150.0 MILLION AND EXTENDED THE FINAL MATURITY DATE TO JANUARY 31, 2024, FROM APRIL 9, 2020. THE BORROWING BASE IS CALCULATED BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE VALUE OF SELECTED U.S., CANADIAN AND U.K. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY, LESS CERTAIN INELIGIBLE AMOUNTS. OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE ABL FACILITY ARE SECURED BY A FIRST PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN SUCH ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY AND OTHER RELATED ASSETS OF MASONITE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES.

SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION  AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE ABL FACILITY ARE SECURED BY A FIRST PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE CURRENT ASSETS OF MASONITE AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES.

THE FOLLOWING UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR OUR NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES IS PRESENTED.  OUR NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES GENERATED EXTERNAL NET SALES OF $491.9 MILLION AND $1.5 BILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, AND $490.4 MILLION AND $1.4 BILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OUR NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES GENERATED ADJUSTED EBITDA OF $65.0 MILLION AND $189.8 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, AND $59.5 MILLION AND $175.7 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OUR NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES HAD TOTAL ASSETS OF $2.0 BILLION AND $1.8 BILLION AND TOTAL LIABILITIES OF $853.5 MILLION AND $711.8 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019, AND DECEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED \"CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\" IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2018, OTHER THAN AS NOTED BELOW.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MASONITE INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION  GOODWILL  WE EVALUATE ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND REPORTED APART FROM GOODWILL. GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD IS TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT ON THE LAST DAY OF FISCAL NOVEMBER, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT IS PERFORMED AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL BY COMPARING THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S CARRYING AMOUNT TO ITS FAIR VALUE. POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT IN GOODWILL IS FIRST ANALYZED USING QUALITATIVE FACTORS SUCH AS MACROECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, CHANGING COSTS AND ACTUAL AND PROJECTED PERFORMANCE, AMONGST OTHERS, TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE BOOK VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE. IF IT IS DETERMINED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE BOOK VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE, A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED TO TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT. WHEN QUANTITATIVE STEPS ARE DETERMINED NECESSARY, THE FAIR VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS ARE ESTIMATED THROUGH THE USE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES AND MARKET MULTIPLES. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE, THEN GOODWILL IS IMPAIRED. ANY IMPAIRMENT IN GOODWILL IS MEASURED BY ALLOCATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO A PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION AND COMPARING THE NOTIONAL GOODWILL FROM THE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WE PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL FOR ALL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, INCLUDING THE ARCHITECTURAL REPORTING UNIT, DETERMINING THAT GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED BASED UPON THE FORECASTS UTILIZED IN THAT TEST. WHILE THERE WAS NO IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT AT THAT TIME, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE ESTIMATE OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FOR THE ARCHITECTURAL REPORTING UNIT MAY CHANGE IN THE NEAR TERM BASED UPON ACTUAL RESULTS AND UPDATED FORWARD-LOOKING FORECASTS, RESULTING IN THE NEED TO WRITE DOWN GOODWILL TO ITS FAIR VALUE.

PROSPECT IS A FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY THAT PRIMARILY LENDS TO AND INVESTS IN MIDDLE MARKET PRIVATELY-HELD COMPANIES. WE ARE A CLOSED-END INVESTMENT COMPANY INCORPORATED IN MARYLAND. WE HAVE ELECTED TO BE REGULATED AS A BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COMPANY (\u201cBDC\u201d) UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 (THE \u201c1940 ACT\u201d). AS A BDC, WE HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANY (\u201cRIC\u201d), UNDER SUBCHAPTER M OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986 (THE \u201cCODE\u201d). WE WERE ORGANIZED ON APRIL 13, 2004, AND WERE FUNDED IN AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING COMPLETED ON JULY 27, 2004.  ON MAY 15, 2007, WE FORMED A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY PROSPECT CAPITAL FUNDING LLC (\u201cPCF\u201d), A DELAWARE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AND A BANKRUPTCY REMOTE SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY, WHICH HOLDS CERTAIN OF OUR PORTFOLIO LOAN INVESTMENTS THAT ARE USED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT PCF. OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY PROSPECT SMALL BUSINESS LENDING, LLC (\u201cPSBL\u201d) WAS FORMED ON JANUARY 27, 2014, AND PURCHASES SMALL BUSINESS WHOLE LOANS ON A RECURRING BASIS FROM ONLINE SMALL BUSINESS LOAN ORIGINATORS, INCLUDING ON DECK CAPITAL, INC. (\u201cONDECK\u201d). ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2014, WE FORMED A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY PROSPECT YIELD CORPORATION, LLC (\u201cPYC\u201d) AND EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 23, 2014, PYC HOLDS A PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN RATED SECURED STRUCTURED NOTES (\u201cRSSN\u201d) AND SUBORDINATED STRUCTURED NOTES (\u201cSSN\u201d) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \u201cCOLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATIONS\u201d OR \u201cCLOS\u201d). EACH OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED SINCE OPERATIONS COMMENCED.  WE CONSOLIDATE CERTAIN OF OUR WHOLLY OWNED AND SUBSTANTIALLY WHOLLY OWNED HOLDING COMPANIES FORMED BY US IN ORDER TO FACILITATE OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY. THE FOLLOWING COMPANIES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE \u201cCONSOLIDATED HOLDING COMPANIES\u201d.  CP HOLDINGS OF DELAWARE LLC (\u201cCP HOLDINGS\u201d); CREDIT CENTRAL HOLDINGS OF DELAWARE, LLC (\u201cCREDIT CENTRAL DELAWARE\u201d); ENERGY SOLUTIONS HOLDINGS INC.; FIRST TOWER HOLDINGS OF DELAWARE LLC (\u201cFIRST TOWER DELAWARE\u201d); MITY HOLDINGS OF DELAWARE INC.

(\u201cVALLEY HOLDINGS I\u201d); VALLEY ELECTRIC HOLDINGS II, INC. (\u201cVALLEY HOLDINGS II\u201d); AND WOLF ENERGY HOLDINGS INC. (\u201cWOLF ENERGY HOLDINGS\u201d).  WE ARE EXTERNALLY MANAGED BY OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER, PROSPECT CAPITAL MANAGEMENT L.P. (\u201cPROSPECT CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\u201d OR THE \u201cINVESTMENT ADVISER\u201d). PROSPECT ADMINISTRATION LLC (\u201cPROSPECT ADMINISTRATION\u201d  ),  A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISER, PROVIDES ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES AND FACILITIES NECESSARY FOR US TO OPERATE.  OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO GENERATE BOTH CURRENT INCOME AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL APPRECIATION THROUGH DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. WE INVEST PRIMARILY IN SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT AND EQUITY OF PRIVATE COMPANIES IN NEED OF CAPITAL FOR ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, GROWTH, DEVELOPMENT, RECAPITALIZATIONS AND OTHER PURPOSES. WE WORK WITH THE MANAGEMENT TEAMS OR FINANCIAL SPONSORS TO SEEK INVESTMENTS WITH HISTORICAL CASH FLOWS, ASSET COLLATERAL OR CONTRACTED PRO FORMA CASH FLOWS.  WE CURRENTLY HAVE NINE STRATEGIES THAT GUIDE OUR ORIGINATION OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES: (1) LENDING TO COMPANIES CONTROLLED BY PRIVATE EQUITY SPONSORS, (2) LENDING TO COMPANIES NOT CONTROLLED BY PRIVATE EQUITY SPONSORS, (3) PURCHASING CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS AND LENDING TO OPERATING COMPANIES, (4) PURCHASING CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS AND LENDING TO FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, (5) PURCHASING CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS AND LENDING TO REAL ESTATE COMPANIES, (6) PURCHASING CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS AND LENDING TO AIRCRAFT LEASING COMPANIES, (7) INVESTING IN STRUCTURED CREDIT, (8) INVESTING IN SYNDICATED DEBT, AND (9) INVESTING IN CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS LOANS AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATIONS. WE MAY ALSO INVEST IN OTHER STRATEGIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FROM TIME TO TIME THAT WE VIEW AS ATTRACTIVE. WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OTHER ORIGINATION STRATEGIES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS WITH NO SPECIFIC TOP-DOWN ALLOCATION TO ANY SINGLE ORIGINATION STRATEGY.  103  LENDING TO COMPANIES CONTROLLED BY PRIVATE EQUITY SPONSORS - WE MAKE AGENTED LOANS TO COMPANIES WHICH ARE CONTROLLED BY PRIVATE EQUITY SPONSORS. THIS DEBT CAN TAKE THE FORM OF FIRST LIEN, SECOND LIEN, UNITRANCHE OR UNSECURED LOANS. THESE LOANS TYPICALLY HAVE EQUITY SUBORDINATE TO OUR LOAN POSITION. HISTORICALLY, THIS STRATEGY HAS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 25%-50% OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  LENDING TO COMPANIES NOT CONTROLLED BY PRIVATE EQUITY SPONSORS - WE MAKE LOANS TO COMPANIES WHICH ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY PRIVATE EQUITY SPONSORS, SUCH AS COMPANIES THAT ARE CONTROLLED BY THE MANAGEMENT TEAM, THE FOUNDER, A FAMILY OR PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS. THIS ORIGINATION STRATEGY MAY HAVE LESS COMPETITION TO PROVIDE DEBT FINANCING THAN THE PRIVATE-EQUITY-SPONSOR ORIGINATION STRATEGY BECAUSE SUCH COMPANY FINANCING NEEDS ARE NOT EASILY ADDRESSED BY BANKS AND OFTEN REQUIRE MORE DILIGENCE PREPARATION. THIS ORIGINATION STRATEGY CAN RESULT IN INVESTMENTS WITH HIGHER RETURNS OR LOWER LEVERAGE THAN THE PRIVATE-EQUITY-SPONSOR ORIGINATION STRATEGY. HISTORICALLY, THIS STRATEGY HAS COMPRISED LESS THAN 5% OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  PURCHASING CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS AND LENDING TO OPERATING COMPANIES - THIS STRATEGY INVOLVES PURCHASING YIELD-PRODUCING DEBT AND CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS IN NON-FINANCIAL-SERVICES OPERATING COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE ENHANCED CERTAINTY OF CLOSURE AND LIQUIDITY TO SELLERS AND WE LOOK FOR MANAGEMENT TO CONTINUE ON IN THEIR CURRENT ROLES. THIS STRATEGY HAS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 5%-10% OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  PURCHASING CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS AND LENDING TO FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES - THIS STRATEGY INVOLVES PURCHASING YIELD-PRODUCING DEBT AND CONTROL EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES, INCLUDING CONSUMER DIRECT LENDING, SUB-PRIME AUTO LENDING AND OTHER STRATEGIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE OFTEN STRUCTURED IN TAX-EFFICIENT PARTNERSHIPS, ENHANCING RETURNS. THIS STRATEGY HAS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 5%-15% OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  PURCHASING CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS AND LENDING TO REAL ESTATE COMPANIES - WE PURCHASE DEBT AND CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS IN TAX-EFFICIENT REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\u201cREIT\u201d OR \u201cREITS\u201d)  . THE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS OF NATIONAL PROPERTY REIT CORP. (\u201cNPRC\u201d) ARE IN VARIOUS CLASSES OF DEVELOPED AND OCCUPIED REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES THAT GENERATE CURRENT YIELDS, INCLUDING MULTI-FAMILY PROPERTIES, STUDENT HOUSING, AND SELF-STORAGE. NPRC SEEKS TO IDENTIFY PROPERTIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT OCCUPANCY RATES AND RECURRING CASH FLOW GENERATION. NPRC GENERALLY CO-INVESTS WITH ESTABLISHED AND EXPERIENCED PROPERTY MANAGEMENT TEAMS THAT MANAGE SUCH PROPERTIES AFTER ACQUISITION. ADDITIONALLY, NPRC PURCHASES LOANS ORIGINATED BY CERTAIN CONSUMER LOAN FACILITATORS. IT PURCHASES EACH LOAN IN ITS ENTIRETY (I.E., A \u201cWHOLE LOAN\u201d). THE BORROWERS ARE CONSUMERS, AND THE LOANS ARE TYPICALLY SERVICED BY THE FACILITATORS OF THE LOANS. THIS INVESTMENT STRATEGY HAS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 10%-20% OF OUR BUSINESS.  PURCHASING CONTROLLING EQUITY POSITIONS AND LENDING TO AIRCRAFT LEASING COMPANIES - WE INVEST IN DEBT AS WELL AS EQUITY IN COMPANIES WITH AIRCRAFT ASSETS SUBJECT TO COMMERCIAL LEASES TO AIRLINES ACROSS THE GLOBE. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE INVESTMENTS CAN PRESENT ATTRACTIVE RETURN OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO CASH FLOW CONSISTENCY FROM LONG-TERM LEASES COUPLED WITH HARD ASSET RESIDUAL VALUE. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE INVESTMENT COMPANIES SEEK TO DELIVER RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS WITH STRONG DOWNSIDE PROTECTION BY ANALYZING RELATIVE VALUE CHARACTERISTICS ACROSS A VARIETY OF AIRCRAFT TYPES AND VINTAGES. THIS STRATEGY HISTORICALLY HAS COMPRISED LESS THAN 5% OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  INVESTING IN STRUCTURED CREDIT - WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN CLOS, OFTEN TAKING A SIGNIFICANT POSITION IN THE SUBORDINATED INTERESTS (EQUITY) AND DEBT OF THE CLOS. THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO OF EACH CLO INVESTMENT IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS APPROXIMATELY 100 TO 200 BROADLY SYNDICATED LOANS AND DOES NOT HAVE DIRECT EXPOSURE TO REAL ESTATE, MORTGAGES, OR CONSUMER-BASED CREDIT ASSETS. THE CLOS IN WHICH WE INVEST ARE MANAGED BY ESTABLISHED COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT TEAMS WITH MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE INDUSTRY. THIS STRATEGY HAS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 10%-20% OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  INVESTING IN SYNDICATED DEBT - ON A PRIMARY OR SECONDARY BASIS, WE PURCHASE PRIMARILY SENIOR AND SECURED LOANS AND HIGH YIELD BONDS THAT HAVE BEEN SOLD TO A CLUB OR SYNDICATE OF BUYERS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE OFTEN PURCHASED WITH A LONG TERM, BUY-AND-HOLD OUTLOOK, AND WE OFTEN LOOK TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT INPUT TO THE TRANSACTION BY PROVIDING ANCHORING ORDERS. THIS STRATEGY HAS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 10%-25% OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  INVESTING IN CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS LOANS AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATIONS - WE PURCHASE LOANS ORIGINATED BY CERTAIN CONSUMER AND SMALL-AND-MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESS (\u201cSME\u201d) LOAN PLATFORMS. WE GENERALLY PURCHASE EACH LOAN IN ITS ENTIRETY (I.E., A \u201cWHOLE LOAN\u201d) AND WE INVEST IN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATIONS COLLATERALIZED BY CONSUMER OR SMALL BUSINESS LOANS. THE BORROWERS ARE CONSUMERS AND SMES AND THE LOANS ARE TYPICALLY SERVICED BY THE PLATFORMS OF THE LOANS. THIS INVESTMENT STRATEGY HAS COMPRISED UP TO APPROXIMATELY 0% OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  104  WE INVEST PRIMARILY IN FIRST AND SECOND LIEN SECURED LOANS AND UNSECURED DEBT, WHICH IN SOME CASES INCLUDES AN EQUITY COMPONENT. FIRST AND SECOND LIEN SECURED LOANS GENERALLY ARE SENIOR DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT RANK AHEAD OF UNSECURED DEBT OF A GIVEN PORTFOLIO COMPANY. THESE LOANS ALSO HAVE THE BENEFIT OF SECURITY INTERESTS ON THE ASSETS OF THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY, WHICH MAY RANK AHEAD OF OR BE JUNIOR TO OTHER SECURITY INTERESTS. OUR INVESTMENTS IN CLOS ARE SUBORDINATED TO SENIOR LOANS AND ARE GENERALLY UNSECURED. WE INVEST IN DEBT AND EQUITY POSITIONS OF CLOS WHICH ARE A FORM OF SECURITIZATION IN WHICH THE CASH FLOWS OF A PORTFOLIO OF LOANS ARE POOLED AND PASSED ON TO DIFFERENT CLASSES OF OWNERS IN VARIOUS TRANCHES. OUR CLO INVESTMENTS ARE DERIVED FROM PORTFOLIOS OF CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES WHICH ARE GENERALLY RISK RATED FROM BB TO B.  WE HOLD MANY OF OUR CONTROL INVESTMENTS IN A TWO-TIER STRUCTURE CONSISTING OF A HOLDING COMPANY AND ONE OR MORE RELATED OPERATING COMPANIES FOR TAX PURPOSES. THESE HOLDING COMPANIES SERVE VARIOUS BUSINESS PURPOSES INCLUDING CONCENTRATION OF MANAGEMENT TEAMS, OPTIMIZATION OF THIRD-PARTY BORROWING COSTS, IMPROVEMENT OF SUPPLIER, CUSTOMER, AND INSURANCE TERMS, AND ENHANCEMENT OF CO-INVESTMENTS BY THE MANAGEMENT TEAMS. IN THESE CASES, OUR INVESTMENT, WHICH IS GENERALLY EQUITY IN THE HOLDING COMPANY, THE HOLDING COMPANY\u2019S EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE OPERATING COMPANY AND ANY DEBT FROM US DIRECTLY TO THE OPERATING COMPANY STRUCTURE REPRESENTS OUR TOTAL EXPOSURE FOR THE INVESTMENT. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , AS SHOWN IN OUR  CONSOLIDATED SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS  , THE COST BASIS AND FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN CONTROLLED COMPANIES WAS  $2,346,633  AND  $2,397,730  , RESPECTIVELY. THIS STRUCTURE GIVES RISE TO SEVERAL OF THE RISKS DESCRIBED IN OUR PUBLIC DOCUMENTS AND HIGHLIGHTED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT. WE CONSOLIDATE ALL WHOLLY OWNED AND SUBSTANTIALLY WHOLLY OWNED HOLDING COMPANIES FORMED BY US FOR THE PURPOSE OF HOLDING OUR CONTROLLED INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING COMPANIES. THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF CONSOLIDATING THESE HOLDING COMPANIES AS THEY HOLD MINIMAL ASSETS OTHER THAN THEIR INVESTMENTS IN THE CONTROLLED OPERATING COMPANIES. INVESTMENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING PROHIBITS THE CONSOLIDATION OF ANY OPERATING COMPANIES.  FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS  INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS  WE SEEK TO BE A LONG-TERM INVESTOR WITH OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE ACQUIRED  $32,509  OF NEW INVESTMENTS, COMPLETED FOLLOW-ON INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING PORTFOLIO COMPANIES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  $47,033  , FUNDED  $500  OF REVOLVER ADVANCES, AND RECORDED PAID IN KIND (\u201cPIK\u201d) INTEREST OF  $14,498  , RESULTING IN GROSS INVESTMENT ORIGINATIONS OF  $94,540  .

DEBT ISSUANCES AND REDEMPTIONS  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE DECREASED TOTAL COMMITMENTS TO OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE  \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d) FOR PCF BY $55,000 TO $1,077,500 IN THE AGGREGATE.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE REPAID  $1,479  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF PROSPECT CAPITAL INTERNOTES\u00ae AT PAR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SURVIVOR\u2019S OPTION, AS DEFINED IN THE INTERNOTES\u00ae OFFERING PROSPECTUS.

AS A RESULT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS, WE RECORDED A LOSS IN THE AMOUNT OF THE UNAMORTIZED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS.

INVESTMENT HOLDINGS  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAVE  $5,450,560  , OR  167.2%  , OF OUR NET ASSETS INVESTED IN  125  LONG-TERM PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS AND CLOS.  OUR ANNUALIZED CURRENT YIELD WAS  12.7%  AND  13.1%  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, ACROSS ALL PERFORMING INTEREST BEARING INVESTMENTS, EXCLUDING EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND NON-ACCRUAL LOANS. OUR ANNUALIZED CURRENT YIELD WAS  10.2%  AND  10.6%  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, ACROSS ALL INVESTMENTS. MONETIZATION OF EQUITY POSITIONS THAT WE HOLD AND LOANS ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS YIELD CALCULATION. IN MANY OF OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES WE HOLD EQUITY POSITIONS, RANGING FROM MINORITY INTERESTS TO MAJORITY STAKES, WHICH WE EXPECT OVER TIME TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR INVESTMENT RETURNS. SOME OF THESE EQUITY POSITIONS INCLUDE FEATURES SUCH AS CONTRACTUAL MINIMUM INTERNAL RATES OF RETURNS, PREFERRED DISTRIBUTIONS, FLIP STRUCTURES AND OTHER FEATURES EXPECTED TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT RETURNS, AS WELL AS CONTRACTUAL PROTECTIONS AND PREFERENCES OVER JUNIOR EQUITY, IN ADDITION TO THE YIELD AND SECURITY OFFERED BY OUR CASH FLOW AND COLLATERAL DEBT PROTECTIONS.  WE ARE A NON-DIVERSIFIED COMPANY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE 1940 ACT. AS REQUIRED BY THE 1940 ACT, WE CLASSIFY OUR INVESTMENTS BY LEVEL OF CONTROL. AS DEFINED IN THE 1940 ACT, \u201cCONTROL INVESTMENTS\u201d ARE THOSE WHERE THERE IS THE ABILITY OR POWER TO EXERCISE A CONTROLLING INFLUENCE OVER THE MANAGEMENT OR POLICIES OF A COMPANY. CONTROL IS GENERALLY DEEMED TO EXIST WHEN A COMPANY OR INDIVIDUAL POSSESSES OR HAS THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE WITHIN 60 DAYS OR LESS, A BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF 25% OR MORE OF THE VOTING SECURITIES OF AN INVESTEE COMPANY. UNDER THE 1940 ACT, \u201cAFFILIATE INVESTMENTS\u201d ARE DEFINED BY A LESSER DEGREE OF INFLUENCE AND ARE DEEMED TO EXIST THROUGH THE POSSESSION OUTRIGHT OR VIA THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE WITHIN 60 DAYS OR LESS, BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF 5% OR MORE OF THE OUTSTANDING VOTING SECURITIES OF ANOTHER PERSON. \u201cNON-CONTROL/NON-AFFILIATE INVESTMENTS\u201d ARE THOSE THAT ARE NEITHER CONTROL INVESTMENTS NOR AFFILIATE INVESTMENTS. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE OWN CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN THE FOLLOWING PORTFOLIO COMPANIES: CP ENERGY SERVICES INC.

IN ORDER TO VALIDATE MARKET QUOTATIONS, MANAGEMENT AND THE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM LOOK AT A NUMBER OF FACTORS TO DETERMINE IF THE QUOTATIONS ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING THE SOURCE AND NATURE OF THE QUOTATIONS. IN DETERMINING THE RANGE OF VALUES FOR DEBT INSTRUMENTS WHERE MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, EXCEPT CLOS AND DEBT INVESTMENTS IN CONTROLLING PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, MANAGEMENT AND THE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM ESTIMATED CORPORATE AND SECURITY CREDIT RATINGS AND IDENTIFIED CORRESPONDING YIELDS TO MATURITY FOR EACH LOAN FROM RELEVANT MARKET DATA. A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUE WAS THEN APPLIED USING THE APPROPRIATE YIELD TO MATURITY AS THE DISCOUNT RATE, TO DETERMINE A RANGE OF VALUES. IN DETERMINING THE RANGE OF VALUES FOR DEBT INVESTMENTS OF CONTROLLED COMPANIES AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, THE ENTERPRISE VALUE WAS DETERMINED BY APPLYING A MARKET APPROACH SUCH AS USING EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME INTEREST, TAX, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) MULTIPLES, NET INCOME AND/OR BOOK VALUE MULTIPLES FOR SIMILAR GUIDELINE PUBLIC COMPANIES AND/OR SIMILAR RECENT INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND/OR AN INCOME APPROACH, SUCH AS THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUE. THE ENTERPRISE VALUE TECHNIQUE MAY ALSO BE USED TO VALUE DEBT INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE CREDIT IMPAIRED. FOR STRESSED DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, A LIQUIDATION ANALYSIS WAS USED.  IN DETERMINING THE RANGE OF VALUES FOR OUR INVESTMENTS IN CLOS, THE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM USES A DISCOUNTED MULTI-PATH CASH FLOW MODEL. THE VALUATIONS WERE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF THE CLO DEAL STRUCTURES TO IDENTIFY THE RISK EXPOSURES FROM THE MODELING POINT OF VIEW AS WELL AS TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE CALL DATE (I.E., EXPECTED MATURITY). THESE RISK FACTORS ARE SENSITIZED IN THE MULTI-PATH CASH FLOW MODEL USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS  , WHICH ARE SIMULATIONS USED TO MODEL THE PROBABILITY OF DIFFERENT OUTCOMES,  TO GENERATE PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED (I.E., MULTI-PATH) CASH FLOWS FOR THE UNDERLYING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THESE CASH FLOWS ARE DISCOUNTED USING APPROPRIATE MARKET DISCOUNT RATES, AND RELEVANT DATA IN THE CLO MARKET AND CERTAIN BENCHMARK CREDIT INDICES ARE CONSIDERED, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF EACH CLO INVESTMENT. IN ADDITION, WE GENERATE A SINGLE-PATH CASH FLOW UTILIZING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED CASH RECEIPTS, AND ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE IMPLIED DISCOUNT RATE THAT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE VALUE DERIVED FROM THE CORRESPONDING MULTI-PATH CASH FLOW MODEL.  WITH RESPECT TO OUR ONLINE CONSUMER AND SME LENDING INITIATIVE, WE INVEST PRIMARILY IN MARKETPLACE LOANS THROUGH MARKETPLACE LENDING PLATFORMS.  WE DO NOT CONDUCT LOAN ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES OURSELVES. THEREFORE, OUR ABILITY TO PURCHASE CONSUMER AND SME LOANS, AND OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR PORTFOLIO OF CONSUMER AND SME LOANS, ARE DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY THE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND COMPETITIVENESS OF THE MARKETPLACE LOAN ORIGINATION BUSINESS OF THE MARKETPLACE LENDING PLATFORMS FROM WHICH WE PURCHASE CONSUMER AND SME LOANS. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ANALYZE THE RISK-RETURN PROFILE OF CONSUMER AND SME LOANS IS SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON THE MARKETPLACE PLATFORMS\u2019 ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE A BORROWER'S CREDIT PROFILE AND LIKELIHOOD OF DEFAULT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE BORROWERS\u2019 CREDIT PROFILES OR THE CREDIT DECISIONING AND SCORING MODELS IMPLEMENTED BY EACH PLATFORM, WE MAY INCUR UNANTICIPATED LOSSES WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS LOOKED AT SEVERAL FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHERE WITHIN THE RANGE TO VALUE THE ASSET INCLUDING: RECENT OPERATING AND FINANCIAL TRENDS FOR THE ASSET, INDEPENDENT RATINGS OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES, COMPARABLE MULTIPLES FOR RECENT SALES OF COMPANIES WITHIN THE INDUSTRY AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS IN CLOS. THE COMPOSITE OF ALL THESE VARIOUS VALUATION TECHNIQUES, APPLIED TO EACH INVESTMENT, WAS A TOTAL VALUATION OF  $5,450,560.  OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES ARE GENERALLY LOWER MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES, OUTSIDE OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR, WITH LESS THAN $100,000 OF ANNUAL EBITDA. WE BELIEVE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS EXPERIENCED LESS VOLATILITY THAN OTHERS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THERE ARE MORE BUY AND HOLD INVESTORS WHO OWN THESE LESS LIQUID INVESTMENTS.  CONTROL INVESTMENTS OFFER INCREASED RISK AND REWARD OVER STRAIGHT DEBT INVESTMENTS. OPERATING RESULTS AND CHANGES IN MARKET MULTIPLES CAN RESULT IN DRAMATIC CHANGES IN VALUES FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER. SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURNS IN OPERATIONS CAN FURTHER RESULT IN OUR LOOKING TO RECOVERIES ON SALES OF ASSETS RATHER THAN THE ENTERPRISE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT. EQUITY POSITIONS IN OUR PORTFOLIO ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN VALUE, BOTH INCREASES AS WELL AS DECREASES, DUE TO CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS AND MARKET MULTIPLES. SEVERAL OF OUR CONTROLLED COMPANIES DISCUSSED BELOW EXPERIENCED SUCH CHANGES AND WE RECORDED CORRESPONDING FLUCTUATIONS IN VALUATIONS DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.

(\u201cINTERDENT\u201d) AND TO APPOINT A NEW BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF INTERDENT, ALL THE MEMBERS OF WHICH ARE OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER\u2019S PROFESSIONALS.

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  2018  INTEREST ON BORROWINGS  $32,449  $32,985  AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS  2,241  2,716  ACCRETION OF DISCOUNT ON UNSECURED DEBT  254  131  FACILITY COMMITMENT FEES  3,954  2,076  TOTAL INTEREST AND CREDIT FACILITY EXPENSES  $38,898  $37,908  AVERAGE PRINCIPAL DEBT OUTSTANDING  $2,305,797  $2,496,642  ANNUALIZED WEIGHTED AVERAGE STATED INTEREST RATE ON BORROWINGS  (1)  5.63%  5.28%  ANNUALIZED WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON BORROWINGS  (2)  6.75%  6.07%  (1)  INCLUDES ONLY THE STATED INTEREST EXPENSE.  (2)  INCLUDES THE STATED INTEREST EXPENSE, AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS, ACCRETION OF DISCOUNT ON PUBLIC NOTES AND COMMITMENT FEES ON THE UNDRAWN PORTION OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  INTEREST EXPENSE IS RELATIVELY STABLE ON A DOLLARS BASIS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  . THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE STATED INTEREST RATE ON BORROWINGS (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION, ACCRETION AND UNDRAWN FACILITY FEES) INCREASED FROM  5.28%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  TO  5.63%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO ISSUANCES OF PUBLIC NOTES AT HIGHER RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REPURCHASES OF OUR CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND INCREASED UTILIZATION OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH BEARS A LOWER RATE THAN OUR REMAINING DEBT.  THE ALLOCATION OF GROSS OVERHEAD EXPENSE FROM PROSPECT ADMINISTRATION WAS $4,078 AND $3,365 FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  PROSPECT ADMINISTRATION RECEIVED ESTIMATED PAYMENTS OF $584 DIRECTLY FROM OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, AND CERTAIN FUNDS MANAGED BY THE INVESTMENT ADVISER FOR LEGAL SERVICES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . NO SUCH PAYMENTS WERE RECEIVED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  WE WERE GIVEN A CREDIT FOR THESE PAYMENTS AS A REDUCTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES COST PAYABLE BY US TO PROSPECT ADMINISTRATION. HAD PROSPECT ADMINISTRATION NOT RECEIVED THESE PAYMENTS, PROSPECT ADMINISTRATION\u2019S CHARGES FOR ITS ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY THIS AMOUNT. NET OVERHEAD DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  TOTALED $3,494  AND  $3,365  , RESPECTIVELY.

THE $540 DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASES IN LEGAL FEES AND AUDIT, COMPLIANCE AND TAX RELATED FEES AND VALUATION SERVICES FEES.  NET INVESTMENT INCOME  NET INVESTMENT INCOME REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INVESTMENT INCOME AND OPERATING EXPENSES. NET INVESTMENT INCOME WAS  $71,060  AND  $85,159  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE OF $14,099 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME OF $18,539 PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES OF $4,440.

OUR PRIMARY USES OF FUNDS HAVE BEEN TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, THROUGH BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, REPAY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AND TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF FUNDS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN ISSUANCES OF DEBT AND EQUITY. MORE RECENTLY, WE HAVE AND MAY CONTINUE TO FUND A PORTION OF OUR CASH NEEDS THROUGH REPAYMENTS AND OPPORTUNISTIC SALES OF OUR EXISTING INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. WE MAY ALSO SECURITIZE A PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN UNSECURED OR SENIOR SECURED LOANS OR OTHER ASSETS. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO PUT IN PLACE SUCH BORROWINGS IN ORDER TO ENABLE US TO EXPAND OUR PORTFOLIO.

WHEN OUR COMMON STOCK IS ISSUED, THE RELATED OFFERING EXPENSES HAVE BEEN CHARGED AGAINST PAID-IN CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF PAR. ALL UNDERWRITING FEES AND OFFERING EXPENSES WERE BORNE BY US.  AS PART OF OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE DELIVERED A NOTICE  WITH OUR ANNUAL PROXY MAILING ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2019.  WE DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  OR  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

UNDER THE 1940 ACT, ASC 946, AND THE REGULATIONS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 6 OF REGULATION S-X, WE ARE PRECLUDED FROM CONSOLIDATING ANY ENTITY OTHER THAN ANOTHER INVESTMENT COMPANY OR AN OPERATING COMPANY WHICH PROVIDES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS SERVICES TO BENEFIT US. OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF PROSPECT, PCF, PSBL, PYC, AND THE CONSOLIDATED HOLDING COMPANIES. ALL INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION. THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OUR NON-SUBSTANTIALLY WHOLLY OWNED HOLDING COMPANIES AND OPERATING PORTFOLIO COMPANY INVESTMENTS ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ANY OPERATING COMPANIES OWNED BY THE CONSOLIDATED HOLDING COMPANIES ARE NOT CONSOLIDATED.  RECLASSIFICATIONS  CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PRESENTATION OF PRIOR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO CONFORM TO THE PRESENTATION AS OF AND FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  USE OF ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF INCOME, EXPENSES, AND GAINS AND LOSSES DURING THE REPORTED PERIOD. CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, FINANCIAL MARKETS, CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE ISSUERS OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ANY OTHER PARAMETERS USED IN DETERMINING THESE ESTIMATES COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER, AND THESE DIFFERENCES COULD BE MATERIAL.  INVESTMENT CLASSIFICATION  WE ARE A NON-DIVERSIFIED COMPANY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE 1940 ACT. AS REQUIRED BY THE 1940 ACT, WE CLASSIFY OUR INVESTMENTS BY LEVEL OF CONTROL. AS DEFINED IN THE 1940 ACT, \u201cCONTROL INVESTMENTS\u201d ARE THOSE WHERE THERE IS THE ABILITY OR POWER TO EXERCISE A CONTROLLING INFLUENCE OVER THE MANAGEMENT OR POLICIES OF A COMPANY. CONTROL IS GENERALLY DEEMED TO EXIST WHEN A COMPANY OR INDIVIDUAL POSSESSES OR HAS THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE WITHIN 60 DAYS OR LESS, A BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF MORE THAN 25% OF THE VOTING SECURITIES OF AN INVESTEE COMPANY. UNDER THE 1940 ACT, \u201cAFFILIATE INVESTMENTS\u201d ARE DEFINED BY A LESSER DEGREE OF INFLUENCE AND ARE DEEMED TO EXIST THROUGH THE POSSESSION OUTRIGHT OR VIA THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE WITHIN 60 DAYS OR LESS, BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF 5% OR MORE OF THE OUTSTANDING VOTING SECURITIES OF ANOTHER PERSON. \u201cNON-CONTROL/NON-AFFILIATE INVESTMENTS\u201d ARE THOSE THAT ARE NEITHER CONTROL INVESTMENTS NOR AFFILIATE INVESTMENTS.  AS A BDC, WE MUST NOT ACQUIRE ANY ASSETS OTHER THAN \u201cQUALIFYING ASSETS\u201d SPECIFIED IN THE 1940 ACT UNLESS, AT THE TIME THE ACQUISITION IS MADE, AT LEAST 70% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS ARE QUALIFYING ASSETS (WITH CERTAIN LIMITED EXCEPTIONS).  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2019  , OUR QUALIFYING ASSETS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ASSETS, STOOD AT  73.04%  AND  73.85%  , RESPECTIVELY.  INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS  INVESTMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN WE ASSUME AN OBLIGATION TO ACQUIRE A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT AND ASSUME THE RISKS FOR GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THAT INSTRUMENT. SPECIFICALLY, WE RECORD ALL SECURITY TRANSACTIONS ON A TRADE DATE BASIS. INVESTMENTS ARE DERECOGNIZED WHEN WE ASSUME AN OBLIGATION TO SELL A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT AND FOREGO THE RISKS FOR GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THAT INSTRUMENT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 325-40,  BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS  , INVESTMENTS IN CLOS ARE PERIODICALLY ASSESSED FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT (\u201cOTTI\u201d). WHEN THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT A CLO HAS OTTI, THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE CLO IS WRITTEN DOWN TO ITS FAIR VALUE AS OF THE DATE OF THE DETERMINATION BASED ON EVENTS AND INFORMATION EVALUATED AND THAT WRITE-DOWN IS RECOGNIZED AS A REALIZED LOSS. AMOUNTS FOR INVESTMENTS TRADED BUT NOT YET SETTLED ARE REPORTED IN DUE TO BROKER OR DUE FROM BROKER, IN THE  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  FOREIGN CURRENCY  FOREIGN CURRENCY AMOUNTS ARE TRANSLATED INTO  US DOLLARS (USD)  ON THE FOLLOWING BASIS.  I.  FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\u2014AT THE SPOT EXCHANGE RATE ON THE LAST BUSINESS DAY OF THE PERIOD; AND  130  II.  PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, INCOME AND EXPENSES\u2014AT THE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING ON THE RESPECTIVE DATES OF SUCH INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS, INCOME OR EXPENSES.  WE DO NOT ISOLATE THAT PORTION OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES ON INVESTMENTS FROM THE FLUCTUATIONS ARISING FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF INVESTMENTS HELD OR DISPOSED OF DURING THE PERIOD. SUCH FLUCTUATIONS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE NET REALIZED AND NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES FROM INVESTMENTS IN THE  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  INVESTMENT RISKS  OUR INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF RISKS. THOSE RISKS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  MARKET RISK  MARKET RISK REPRESENTS THE POTENTIAL LOSS THAT CAN BE CAUSED BY A CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.  CREDIT RISK  CREDIT RISK REPRESENTS THE RISK THAT WE WOULD INCUR IF THE COUNTERPARTIES FAILED TO PERFORM PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THEIR AGREEMENTS WITH US.  LIQUIDITY RISK  LIQUIDITY RISK REPRESENTS THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAPIDLY ADJUST THE SIZE OF OUR INVESTMENT POSITIONS IN TIMES OF HIGH VOLATILITY AND FINANCIAL STRESS AT A REASONABLE PRICE.  INTEREST RATE RISK  INTEREST RATE RISK REPRESENTS A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INTEREST-BEARING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.  PREPAYMENT RISK  MANY OF OUR DEBT INVESTMENTS ALLOW FOR PREPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL WITHOUT PENALTY. DOWNWARD CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES MAY CAUSE PREPAYMENTS TO OCCUR AT A FASTER THAN EXPECTED RATE, THEREBY EFFECTIVELY SHORTENING THE MATURITY OF THE SECURITY AND MAKING US LESS LIKELY TO FULLY EARN ALL OF THE EXPECTED INCOME OF THAT SECURITY AND REINVESTING IN A LOWER YIELDING INSTRUMENT.  STRUCTURED CREDIT RELATED RISK  CLO INVESTMENTS MAY BE RISKIER AND LESS TRANSPARENT TO US THAN DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN UNDERLYING COMPANIES. CLOS TYPICALLY WILL HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT ASSETS OTHER THAN THEIR UNDERLYING SENIOR SECURED LOANS. THEREFORE, PAYMENTS ON CLO INVESTMENTS ARE AND WILL BE PAYABLE SOLELY FROM THE CASH FLOWS FROM SUCH SENIOR SECURED LOANS.  ONLINE SMALL-AND-MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESS LENDING RISK  WITH RESPECT TO OUR ONLINE SMALL-AND-MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESS (\u201cSME\u201d) LENDING INITIATIVE, WE INVEST PRIMARILY IN MARKETPLACE LOANS THROUGH MARKETPLACE LENDING PLATFORMS (E.G. ONDECK). WE DO NOT CONDUCT LOAN ORIGINATION ACTIVITIES OURSELVES. THEREFORE, OUR ABILITY TO PURCHASE SME LOANS, AND OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR PORTFOLIO OF SME LOANS, IS DIRECTLY INFLUENCED BY THE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND COMPETITIVENESS OF THE MARKETPLACE LOAN ORIGINATION BUSINESS OF THE MARKETPLACE LENDING PLATFORMS FROM WHICH WE PURCHASE SME LOANS. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ANALYZE THE RISK-RETURN PROFILE OF SME LOANS IS SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDENT ON THE MARKETPLACE PLATFORMS\u2019 ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE A BORROWER'S CREDIT PROFILE AND LIKELIHOOD OF DEFAULT. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE BORROWERS' CREDIT PROFILES OR THE CREDIT DECISIONING AND SCORING MODELS IMPLEMENTED BY EACH PLATFORM, WE MAY INCUR UNANTICIPATED LOSSES WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  FOREIGN CURRENCY  INVESTMENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS MAY INVOLVE CERTAIN CONSIDERATIONS AND RISKS NOT TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE OF DOMESTIC ORIGIN. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND REVALUATIONS AND FUTURE ADVERSE POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, WHICH COULD CAUSE INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN MARKETS TO BE LESS LIQUID AND PRICES MORE VOLATILE THAN THOSE OF COMPARABLE U.S. COMPANIES OR U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES.  131  INVESTMENT VALUATION  TO VALUE OUR INVESTMENTS, WE FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE OF ASC 820,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  (\u201cASC 820\u201d), THAT DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP, AND REQUIRES DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 820, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IS DEFINED AS THE PRICE THAT WE WOULD RECEIVE UPON SELLING AN INVESTMENT IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION TO AN INDEPENDENT BUYER IN THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET IN WHICH THAT INVESTMENT IS TRANSACTED.  ASC 820 CLASSIFIES THE INPUTS USED TO MEASURE THESE FAIR VALUES INTO THE FOLLOWING HIERARCHY.  LEVEL 1  : QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, ACCESSIBLE BY US AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.  LEVEL 2  : QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, OR QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, OR OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES.  LEVEL 3  : UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.  IN ALL CASES, THE LEVEL IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WITHIN WHICH THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY FALLS HAS BEEN DETERMINED BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A PARTICULAR INPUT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY REQUIRES JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS FACTORS SPECIFIC TO EACH INVESTMENT.  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES FOR THE VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THESE PROCEDURES ARE DETAILED BELOW.  INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE READILY AVAILABLE ARE VALUED AT SUCH MARKET QUOTATIONS.  FOR MOST OF OUR INVESTMENTS, MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE. WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE OR WHEN SUCH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE DEEMED NOT TO REPRESENT FAIR VALUE, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS APPROVED A MULTI-STEP VALUATION PROCESS EACH QUARTER, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.  1.  EACH PORTFOLIO COMPANY OR INVESTMENT IS REVIEWED BY OUR INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS WITH INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRMS ENGAGED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  2.  THE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRMS PREPARE INDEPENDENT VALUATIONS FOR EACH INVESTMENT BASED ON THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENTS AND ISSUE THEIR REPORT.  3.  THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEWS AND DISCUSSES WITH THE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRMS THE VALUATION REPORTS, AND THEN MAKES A RECOMMENDATION TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE VALUE FOR EACH INVESTMENT.  4.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSES VALUATIONS AND DETERMINES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH INVESTMENT IN OUR PORTFOLIO IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON THE INPUT OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISER, THE RESPECTIVE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE.  OUR NON-CLO INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED UTILIZING A YIELD TECHNIQUE, ENTERPRISE VALUE (\u201cEV\u201d) TECHNIQUE, NET ASSET VALUE TECHNIQUE, LIQUIDATION TECHNIQUE, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUE, OR A COMBINATION OF TECHNIQUES, AS APPROPRIATE. THE YIELD TECHNIQUE USES LOAN SPREADS FOR LOANS AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION IMPLIED BY MARKET DATA INVOLVING IDENTICAL OR COMPARABLE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. UNDER THE EV TECHNIQUE, THE EV OF A PORTFOLIO COMPANY IS FIRST DETERMINED AND ALLOCATED OVER THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY\u2019S SECURITIES IN ORDER OF THEIR PREFERENCE RELATIVE TO ONE ANOTHER (I.E., \u201cWATERFALL\u201d ALLOCATION). TO DETERMINE THE EV, WE TYPICALLY USE A MARKET (MULTIPLES) VALUATION APPROACH THAT CONSIDERS RELEVANT AND APPLICABLE MARKET TRADING DATA OF GUIDELINE PUBLIC COMPANIES, TRANSACTION METRICS FROM PRECEDENT MERGER AND ACQUISITIONS TRANSACTIONS, AND/OR A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUE. THE NET ASSET VALUE TECHNIQUE, AN INCOME APPROACH, IS USED TO DERIVE A VALUE OF AN UNDERLYING INVESTMENT (SUCH AS REAL ESTATE PROPERTY) BY DIVIDING A RELEVANT EARNINGS STREAM BY AN APPROPRIATE CAPITALIZATION RATE. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE CONSIDER CAPITALIZATION RATES FOR SIMILAR PROPERTIES AS MAY BE OBTAINED FROM GUIDELINE PUBLIC COMPANIES AND/OR RELEVANT TRANSACTIONS. THE LIQUIDATION TECHNIQUE IS INTENDED TO APPROXIMATE THE NET RECOVERY VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING LIQUIDATION PROCEEDS BASED ON A HYPOTHETICAL LIQUIDATION OF A PORTFOLIO COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW TECHNIQUE CONVERTS FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR EARNINGS TO A RANGE OF FAIR VALUES FROM WHICH A SINGLE ESTIMATE MAY BE DERIVED UTILIZING AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE. THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IS BASED ON THE NET PRESENT VALUE INDICATED BY CURRENT MARKET EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THOSE FUTURE AMOUNTS.  IN APPLYING THESE METHODOLOGIES, ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT WE CONSIDER IN VALUING OUR INVESTMENTS MAY INCLUDE, AS WE DEEM RELEVANT: SECURITY COVENANTS, CALL PROTECTION PROVISIONS, AND INFORMATION RIGHTS; THE NATURE AND REALIZABLE VALUE OF ANY COLLATERAL; THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS; THE PRINCIPAL MARKETS IN WHICH THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY DOES BUSINESS; PUBLICLY AVAILABLE FINANCIAL RATIOS OF PEER COMPANIES; THE PRINCIPAL MARKET; AND ENTERPRISE VALUES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.  132  OUR INVESTMENTS IN CLOS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASURED SECURITIES UNDER ASC 820 AND ARE VALUED USING A DISCOUNTED MULTI-PATH CASH FLOW MODEL. THE CLO STRUCTURES ARE ANALYZED TO IDENTIFY THE RISK EXPOSURES AND TO DETERMINE AN APPROPRIATE CALL DATE (I.E., EXPECTED MATURITY). THESE RISK FACTORS ARE SENSITIZED IN THE MULTI-PATH CASH FLOW MODEL USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS, WHICH IS A SIMULATION USED TO MODEL THE PROBABILITY OF DIFFERENT OUTCOMES, TO GENERATE PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED (I.E., MULTI-PATH) CASH FLOWS FROM THE UNDERLYING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  THESE CASH FLOWS ARE DISCOUNTED USING APPROPRIATE MARKET DISCOUNT RATES, AND RELEVANT DATA IN THE CLO MARKET AS WELL AS CERTAIN BENCHMARK CREDIT INDICES ARE CONSIDERED, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF EACH CLO INVESTMENT.  IN ADDITION, WE GENERATE A SINGLE-PATH CASH FLOW UTILIZING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF EXPECTED CASH RECEIPTS, AND ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE IMPLIED DISCOUNT RATE THAT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE VALUE DERIVED FROM THE MULTI-PATH CASH FLOWS.  WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR AND HAVE NO INFLUENCE OVER THE ASSET MANAGEMENT OF THE PORTFOLIOS UNDERLYING THE CLO INVESTMENTS WE HOLD, AS THOSE PORTFOLIOS ARE MANAGED BY NON-AFFILIATED THIRD-PARTY CLO COLLATERAL MANAGERS. THE MAIN RISK FACTORS ARE DEFAULT RISK, PREPAYMENT RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, DOWNGRADE RISK, AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK.  VALUATION OF OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES  ASC 825,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  , SPECIFICALLY ASC 825-10-25, PERMITS AN ENTITY TO CHOOSE, AT SPECIFIED ELECTION DATES, TO MEASURE ELIGIBLE ITEMS AT FAIR VALUE (THE \u201cFAIR VALUE OPTION\u201d). WE HAVE NOT ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION TO REPORT SELECTED FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES.  SEE NOTE 8 IN THE ACCOMPANYING  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR THE DISCLOSURE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT AND THE MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE.  CONVERTIBLE NOTES  WE HAVE RECORDED THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES AT THEIR CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTIONS IN THE CONVERTIBLE UNSECURED NOTES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE SEPARATELY ACCOUNTED FOR AS A DERIVATIVE UNDER ASC 815,  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING.  SEE NOTE 5 IN THE ACCOMPANYING  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS ARE CALCULATED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.  INTEREST INCOME, ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUM AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNT, IS RECORDED ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS. LOAN ORIGINATION FEES, ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT, AND MARKET DISCOUNTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND ACCRETED INTO INTEREST INCOME OVER THE RESPECTIVE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE LOANS USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD OR STRAIGHT-LINE, AS APPLICABLE, AND ADJUSTED ONLY FOR MATERIAL AMENDMENTS OR PREPAYMENTS. UPON A PREPAYMENT OF A LOAN, PREPAYMENT PREMIUMS, ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT, OR MARKET DISCOUNTS ARE RECORDED AS INTEREST INCOME.  LOANS ARE PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS WHEN THERE IS REASONABLE DOUBT THAT PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST WILL BE COLLECTED. UNPAID ACCRUED INTEREST IS GENERALLY REVERSED WHEN A LOAN IS PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS. INTEREST PAYMENTS RECEIVED ON NON-ACCRUAL LOANS ARE EITHER APPLIED TO THE COST BASIS OR INTEREST INCOME, DEPENDING UPON MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT OF THE COLLECTIBILITY OF THE LOAN RECEIVABLE. NON-ACCRUAL LOANS ARE RESTORED TO ACCRUAL STATUS WHEN PAST DUE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS PAID AND IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT, IS LIKELY TO REMAIN CURRENT AND FUTURE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST COLLECTIONS WHEN DUE ARE PROBABLE. INTEREST RECEIVED AND APPLIED AGAINST COST WHILE A LOAN IS ON NON-ACCRUAL, AND PIK INTEREST CAPITALIZED BUT NOT RECOGNIZED WHILE ON NON-ACCRUAL, IS RECOGNIZED PROSPECTIVELY ON THE EFFECTIVE YIELD BASIS THROUGH MATURITY OF THE LOAN WHEN PLACED BACK ON ACCRUAL STATUS, TO THE EXTENT DEEMED COLLECTIBLE BY MANAGEMENT. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY  2.4%  OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE ARE IN NON-ACCRUAL STATUS.  SOME OF OUR LOANS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS MAY HAVE CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT-IN-KIND (\u201cPIK\u201d) INTEREST OR DIVIDENDS. PIK INCOME COMPUTED AT THE CONTRACTUAL RATE IS ACCRUED INTO INCOME AND REFLECTED AS RECEIVABLE UP TO THE CAPITALIZATION DATE. PIK INVESTMENTS OFFER ISSUERS THE OPTION AT EACH PAYMENT DATE OF MAKING PAYMENTS IN CASH OR IN ADDITIONAL SECURITIES. WHEN ADDITIONAL SECURITIES ARE RECEIVED, THEY TYPICALLY HAVE THE SAME TERMS, INCLUDING MATURITY DATES AND INTEREST RATES AS THE ORIGINAL SECURITIES ISSUED. ON THESE PAYMENT DATES, WE CAPITALIZE THE ACCRUED INTEREST (REFLECTING SUCH AMOUNTS IN THE BASIS AS ADDITIONAL SECURITIES RECEIVED). PIK GENERALLY BECOMES DUE AT MATURITY OF THE INVESTMENT OR UPON THE INVESTMENT BEING CALLED BY THE ISSUER. AT THE POINT THAT WE BELIEVE PIK IS NOT FULLY EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED, THE PIK INVESTMENT WILL BE PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS. WHEN A PIK INVESTMENT IS PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS, THE ACCRUED, UNCAPITALIZED INTEREST OR DIVIDENDS ARE REVERSED FROM THE RELATED RECEIVABLE THROUGH INTEREST OR DIVIDEND INCOME, RESPECTIVELY. WE DO NOT REVERSE PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED PIK INTEREST OR DIVIDENDS. UPON CAPITALIZATION, PIK IS SUBJECT TO THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR RELATED INVESTMENTS. PIK INVESTMENTS ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS ARE RESTORED TO ACCRUAL STATUS IF WE BELIEVE THAT PIK IS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED.  INTEREST INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS IN SUBORDINATED STRUCTURED NOTES (TYPICALLY PREFERRED SHARES, INCOME NOTES OR SUBORDINATED NOTES OF CLO FUNDS) AND \u201cEQUITY\u201d CLASS OF SECURITY OF SECURITIZED TRUST IS RECORDED BASED UPON AN ESTIMATION OF AN EFFECTIVE YIELD TO EXPECTED MATURITY UTILIZING ASSUMED CASH FLOWS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 325-40,  BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL  133  ASSETS  . WE MONITOR THE EXPECTED CASH INFLOWS FROM OUR CLO AND SECURITIZED TRUST EQUITY INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING THE EXPECTED RESIDUAL PAYMENTS, AND THE EFFECTIVE YIELD IS DETERMINED AND UPDATED PERIODICALLY.  DIVIDEND INCOME IS RECORDED ON THE EX-DIVIDEND DATE.  OTHER INCOME GENERALLY INCLUDES AMENDMENT FEES, COMMITMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES AND STRUCTURING FEES WHICH ARE RECORDED WHEN EARNED. EXCESS DEAL DEPOSITS, NET PROFITS INTERESTS AND OVERRIDING ROYALTY INTERESTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME.  SEE NOTE 10 IN THE ACCOMPANYING  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES  WE HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A  RIC  AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CODE APPLICABLE TO REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANIES. WE ARE REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE AT LEAST 90% OF OUR INVESTMENT COMPANY TAXABLE INCOME AND INTEND TO DISTRIBUTE (OR RETAIN THROUGH A DEEMED DISTRIBUTION) ALL OF OUR INVESTMENT COMPANY TAXABLE INCOME AND NET CAPITAL GAIN TO STOCKHOLDERS; THEREFORE, WE HAVE MADE NO PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THE CHARACTER OF INCOME AND GAINS THAT WE WILL DISTRIBUTE IS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH INCOME TAX REGULATIONS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM GAAP. BOOK AND TAX BASIS DIFFERENCES RELATING TO STOCKHOLDER DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER PERMANENT BOOK AND TAX DIFFERENCES ARE RECLASSIFIED TO PAID-IN CAPITAL.  IF WE DO NOT DISTRIBUTE (OR ARE NOT DEEMED TO HAVE DISTRIBUTED) AT LEAST 98% OF OUR ANNUAL ORDINARY INCOME AND 98.2% OF OUR CAPITAL GAINS IN THE CALENDAR YEAR EARNED, WE WILL GENERALLY BE REQUIRED TO PAY AN EXCISE TAX EQUAL TO 4% OF THE AMOUNT BY WHICH 98% OF OUR ANNUAL ORDINARY INCOME AND 98.2% OF OUR CAPITAL GAINS EXCEED THE DISTRIBUTIONS FROM SUCH TAXABLE INCOME FOR THE YEAR. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DETERMINE THAT OUR ESTIMATED CURRENT YEAR ANNUAL TAXABLE INCOME WILL BE IN EXCESS OF ESTIMATED CURRENT YEAR DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM SUCH TAXABLE INCOME, WE ACCRUE EXCISE TAXES, IF ANY, ON ESTIMATED EXCESS TAXABLE INCOME. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE ANY EXCISE TAX DUE FOR THE 2019 CALENDAR YEAR. THUS, WE HAVE NOT ACCRUED ANY EXCISE TAX FOR THIS PERIOD.  IF WE FAIL TO SATISFY THE ANNUAL DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT OR OTHERWISE FAIL TO QUALIFY AS A RIC IN ANY TAXABLE YEAR, WE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO TAX ON ALL OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME AT REGULAR CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATES. WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DEDUCT DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS, NOR WOULD WE BE REQUIRED TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS. DISTRIBUTIONS WOULD GENERALLY BE TAXABLE TO OUR INDIVIDUAL AND OTHER NON-CORPORATE TAXABLE STOCKHOLDERS AS ORDINARY DIVIDEND INCOME ELIGIBLE FOR THE REDUCED MAXIMUM RATE APPLICABLE TO QUALIFIED DIVIDEND INCOME TO THE EXTENT OF OUR CURRENT AND ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS, PROVIDED CERTAIN HOLDING PERIOD AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE MET. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS UNDER THE CODE, CORPORATE DISTRIBUTIONS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE DIVIDENDS-RECEIVED DEDUCTION. TO QUALIFY AGAIN TO BE TAXED AS A RIC IN A SUBSEQUENT YEAR, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS OUR ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-RIC YEARS. IN ADDITION, IF WE FAILED TO QUALIFY AS A RIC FOR A PERIOD GREATER THAN TWO TAXABLE YEARS, THEN, IN ORDER TO QUALIFY AS A RIC IN A SUBSEQUENT YEAR, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ELECT TO RECOGNIZE AND PAY TAX ON ANY NET BUILT-IN GAIN (THE EXCESS OF AGGREGATE GAIN, INCLUDING ITEMS OF INCOME, OVER AGGREGATE LOSS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REALIZED IF WE HAD BEEN LIQUIDATED) OR, ALTERNATIVELY, BE SUBJECT TO TAXATION ON SUCH BUILT-IN GAIN RECOGNIZED FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS.  WE FOLLOW ASC 740,  INCOME TAXES  (\u201cASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR HOW UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED, MEASURED, PRESENTED, AND DISCLOSED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ASC 740 REQUIRES THE EVALUATION OF TAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN THE COURSE OF PREPARING OUR TAX RETURNS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE TAX POSITIONS ARE \u201cMORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT\u201d OF BEING SUSTAINED BY THE APPLICABLE TAX AUTHORITY. TAX POSITIONS NOT DEEMED TO MEET THE MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THRESHOLD ARE RECORDED AS A TAX BENEFIT OR EXPENSE IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE DID NOT RECORD ANY UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OR LIABILITIES. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DETERMINATIONS REGARDING ASC 740 MAY BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND ADJUSTMENT AT A LATER DATE BASED UPON FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AN ON-GOING ANALYSIS OF TAX LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS THEREOF. ALTHOUGH WE FILE BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS, OUR MAJOR TAX JURISDICTION IS FEDERAL. OUR FEDERAL TAX RETURNS FOR THE TAX YEARS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016 AND THEREAFTER REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE.  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS ARE RECORDED ON THE EX-DIVIDEND DATE. THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, TO BE PAID AS A MONTHLY DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION IS APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS QUARTERLY AND IS GENERALLY BASED UPON OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATE OF OUR FUTURE TAXABLE EARNINGS. NET REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, ARE DISTRIBUTED AT LEAST ANNUALLY.  FINANCING COSTS  WE RECORD ORIGINATION EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE UNSECURED NOTES AS DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS. THESE EXPENSES ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED AS PART OF INTEREST EXPENSE USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE STATED LIFE OF THE OBLIGATION FOR OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE SAME METHODOLOGY IS USED TO APPROXIMATE THE EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD FOR OUR  134  PROSPECT CAPITAL INTERNOTES\u00ae AND OUR 2024, 2028, AND 2029 NOTES FOLLOW-ON PROGRAMS.  THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD IS USED TO AMORTIZE DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS FOR OUR REMAINING UNSECURED NOTES OVER THE RESPECTIVE EXPECTED LIFE OR MATURITY. IN THE EVENT THAT WE MODIFY OR EXTINGUISH OUR DEBT BEFORE MATURITY, WE FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE IN ASC 470-50,  MODIFICATION AND EXTINGUISHMENTS  (\u201cASC 470-50\u201d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u201cASC 460\u201d). ASC 460 ELABORATES ON THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF A GUARANTOR IN ITS INTERIM AND ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ABOUT ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN GUARANTEES THAT IT HAS ISSUED. IT ALSO REQUIRES A GUARANTOR TO RECOGNIZE, AT THE INCEPTION OF A GUARANTEE, FOR THOSE GUARANTEES THAT ARE COVERED BY ASC 460, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION UNDERTAKEN IN ISSUING CERTAIN GUARANTEES.  PER SHARE INFORMATION  NET INCREASE OR DECREASE IN NET ASSETS RESULTING FROM OPERATIONS PER SHARE IS CALCULATED USING THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD PRESENTED. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 946, CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES ARE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE CALCULATION OF NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-13,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS-CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326): MEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d), WHICH AMENDS THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IMPAIRMENT GUIDANCE SO THAT AN ENTITY IS REQUIRED TO MEASURE EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT CONDITIONS AND REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE FORECASTS. AS SUCH, AN ENTITY WILL USE FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION TO ESTIMATE CREDIT LOSSES. ASU 2016-13 ALSO AMENDS THE GUIDANCE IN FASB ASC SUBTOPIC NO. 325-40,  INVESTMENTS-OTHER, BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS  , RELATED TO THE SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT OF ACCRETABLE YIELD RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST INCOME OVER THE LIFE OF A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS UNDER THE EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD. ASU 2016-13 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED AS OF THE FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF ADOPTING THIS ASU ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-13,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820)  .  DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK\u2014CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.  THE STANDARD WILL MODIFY THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS BY REMOVING, MODIFYING, OR ADDING CERTAIN DISCLOSURES. ASU NO. 2018-13 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THAT REPORTING PERIOD. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED UPON ISSUANCE OF THIS ASU. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING THIS ASU ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  SEC DISCLOSURE UPDATE AND SIMPLIFICATION  IN AUGUST 2018, THE SEC ADOPTED THE FINAL RULE UNDER SEC RELEASE NO. 33-10532,  DISCLOSURE UPDATE AND SIMPLIFICATION  , AMENDING CERTAIN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE REDUNDANT, DUPLICATIVE, OVERLAPPING, OUTDATED OR SUPERSEDED. THE AMENDMENTS ARE INTENDED TO FACILITATE THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO INVESTORS AND SIMPLIFY COMPLIANCE. WE HAVE ADOPTED THE AMENDMENTS AND HAVE RETROSPECTIVELY APPLIED THE PRESENTATION AMENDMENTS TO THE PRIOR PERIOD STATEMENTS PRESENTED.  PRIOR TO ADOPTION AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH PREVIOUS SEC RULES, WE PRESENTED DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS (LOSS) ON THE  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  , AS THREE COMPONENTS: 1) ACCUMULATED OVERDISTRIBUTED NET INVESTMENT INCOME; 2) ACCUMULATED NET UNREALIZED GAIN (LOSS) ON INVESTMENTS; AND 3) ACCUMULATED NET REALIZED GAIN (LOSS) ON INVESTMENTS. WE ALSO PRESENTED DISTRIBUTIONS FROM EARNINGS ON THE  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN NET ASSETS  AS DISTRIBUTIONS FROM NET INVESTMENT INCOME. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SEC RELEASE, DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS AND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS ARE SHOWN IN TOTAL ON THE  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  AND  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN NET ASSETS  , RESPECTIVELY.  135  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES THE RECONCILIATION OF THE COMPONENTS OF DISTRIBUTABLE EARNINGS (LOSS) TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTATION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

THE TAX ACT ALSO AUTHORIZES THE IRS TO ISSUE REGULATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE NEW PROVISIONS. WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW THE CHANGES IN THE TAX ACT, OR REGULATIONS OR OTHER GUIDANCE ISSUED UNDER IT, MIGHT AFFECT US, OUR BUSINESS OR THE BUSINESS OF OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. HOWEVER, OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES MAY OR MAY NOT MAKE CERTAIN ELECTIONS UNDER THE TAX ACT THAT COULD MATERIALLY INCREASE THEIR TAXABLE EARNINGS AND PROFITS.

WE ALSO HAVE A DEDICATED BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT TEAM FOCUSED ON GENERATING ENGAGEMENTS WITH NEW CLIENTS TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR CLIENT BASE AND, OVER TIME, REDUCE CLIENT CONCENTRATION.  \u200b  WE DERIVE OUR REVENUE FROM TWO TYPES OF SERVICE OFFERINGS: APPLICATION OUTSOURCING, WHICH IS RECURRING IN NATURE; AND CONSULTING, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY IMPLEMENTATION, WHICH IS NON-RECURRING IN NATURE. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR APPLICATION OUTSOURCING AND CONSULTING REVENUE REPRESENTED 55% AND 45%, RESPECTIVELY OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE AS COMPARED TO 53% AND 47%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR APPLICATION OUTSOURCING AND CONSULTING REVENUE REPRESENTED 56% AND 44%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE AS COMPARED TO 53% AND 47%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  \u200b  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR NORTH AMERICA REVENUE INCREASED BY 11.0%, OR $24.0 MILLION, TO $242.3 MILLION, OR 73.8% OF TOTAL REVENUE, FROM $218.3 MILLION, OR 71.5% OF TOTAL REVENUE, IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

THE INCREASE IN NORTH AMERICA REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM CLIENTS IN THE C&T INDUSTRY GROUP, INCLUDING CUSTOMER CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS ACQUIRED FROM THIRD PARTIES.  \u200b  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR EUROPEAN REVENUE DECREASED BY 5.6%, OR $3.4 MILLION, TO $57.0 MILLION, OR 17.4% OF TOTAL REVENUE, FROM $60.4 MILLION, OR 19.8% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

THE DECREASE IN EUROPEAN REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM ONE OF OUR LARGE BANKING CLIENTS AND THE SUBSTANTIAL DEPRECIATION IN THE GBP AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR.  \u200b  OUR GROSS PROFIT INCREASED BY $0.7 MILLION TO $89.9 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO $89.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. OUR GROSS PROFIT INCREASED BY $1.5 MILLION TO $174.2 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $172.7 MILLION IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ONSITE EFFORT AND SUBCONTRACTOR COSTS. AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, GROSS MARGIN WAS 27.4% AND 29.2% IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, GROSS MARGIN, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, WAS 26.9% AND 28.5%, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN DURING THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ONSITE EFFORT, AN INCREASE IN SUBCONTRACTORS COST AND LOWER UTILIZATION.  WE PERFORM OUR SERVICES UNDER BOTH TIME-AND-MATERIALS AND FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS. REVENUE FROM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS REPRESENTED 39% AND 40% OF TOTAL REVENUE, AND REVENUE FROM TIME-AND-MATERIALS CONTRACTS REPRESENTED 61% AND 60% OF TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. REVENUE FROM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS REPRESENTED 40% AND 40% OF TOTAL REVENUE AND REVENUE FROM TIME-AND-MATERIALS CONTRACTS REPRESENTED 60% AND  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  60% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE REVENUE EARNED FROM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS IN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 PRIMARILY REFLECTS OUR CLIENT PREFERENCES.  \u200b  AS AN IT SERVICES COMPANY, OUR REVENUE GROWTH IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, DEVELOP, MOTIVATE AND RETAIN SKILLED IT PROFESSIONALS. WE MONITOR OUR OVERALL ATTRITION RATES AND PATTERNS TO ALIGN OUR PEOPLE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY WITH OUR GROWTH OBJECTIVES. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR ATTRITION RATE FOR THE TRAILING 12 MONTHS, WHICH REFLECTS VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY ATTRITION, WAS APPROXIMATELY 25.6%. OUR ATTRITION RATE AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 REFLECTS A HIGHER RATE OF ATTRITION AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE MAJORITY OF OUR ATTRITION OCCURS IN INDIA AND SRI LANKA, AND IS WEIGHTED TOWARDS THE MORE JUNIOR MEMBERS OF OUR STAFF. IN RESPONSE TO HIGHER ATTRITION AND AS PART OF OUR RETENTION STRATEGIES, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT COSTS, WHICH MAY CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER, WE TRY TO ABSORB SUCH COST INCREASES THROUGH PRICE INCREASES OR COST MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES SUCH AS MANAGING DISCRETIONARY COSTS, THE MIX OF PROFESSIONAL STAFF AND UTILIZATION LEVELS AND ACHIEVING OTHER OPERATING EFFICIENCIES. IF OUR ATTRITION RATE INCREASES OR IS SUSTAINED AT HIGHER LEVELS, OUR GROWTH MAY SLOW AND OUR COST OF ATTRACTING AND RETAINING IT PROFESSIONALS COULD INCREASE.  \u200b  WE ENGAGE IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING STRATEGY USING FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNED TO HEDGE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE INDIAN RUPEE AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR AND THE GBP, AS WELL AS THE EURO, THE CANADIAN DOLLAR, THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR AND THE GBP AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHEN CONSOLIDATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE HEDGING PROGRAMS OR HEDGING CONTRACTS WILL BE EFFECTIVE. BECAUSE THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE VOLATILITY IN THE INDIAN RUPEE, GBP AND EURO EXCHANGE RATES, THEY NOT ONLY REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF A STRONGER INDIAN RUPEE, WEAKER GBP, EURO, CANADIAN DOLLAR AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR BUT ALSO COULD REDUCE THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF A WEAKER INDIAN RUPEE ON OUR INDIAN RUPEE EXPENSES OR REDUCE THE IMPACT OF A STRONGER GBP, EURO, CANADIAN DOLLAR AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR ON OUR GBP, EURO, CANADIAN DOLLAR AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR DENOMINATED REVENUES.  \u200b  APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND RISKS  \u200b  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING THE RECOVERABILITY OF TANGIBLE ASSETS, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATES OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, IN PARTICULAR THOSE RELATED TO THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND PROFITS BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, INCOME TAXES, INCLUDING RESERVES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, DEFERRED TAXES AND LIABILITIES, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDING DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND INVESTMENTS. ACTUAL AMOUNTS COULD DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES. OUR MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.

THE INCREASE IN REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM SEVERAL OF OUR TOP TEN CLIENTS, PRIMARILY IN OUR C&T INDUSTRY GROUP, INCLUDING CUSTOMER CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS ACQUIRED FROM THIRD PARTIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN ONE OF OUR LARGE EUROPEAN BANKING CLIENTS, SUBSTANTIAL DEPRECIATION IN THE GBP AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR AND A DECREASE IN OUR M&I INDUSTRY GROUP. REVENUE FROM NORTH AMERICAN CLIENTS IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 INCREASED BY $24.0 MILLION, OR 11.0%, AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, PARTICULARLY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM CLIENTS IN THE C&T INDUSTRY GROUP. REVENUE FROM EUROPEAN CLIENTS DECREASED BY $3.4 MILLION, OR 5.6%, AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM ONE OF OUR LARGE BANKING CLIENTS AND A SUBSTANTIAL DEPRECIATION IN THE GBP AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR.

(THE \u201cADMINISTRATIVE AGENT\u201d) AND THE LENDERS PARTY THERETO (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT\u201d), WHICH AMENDS THE COMPANY\u2019S AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF FEBRUARY 6, 2018, WITH SUCH PARTIES (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCREASE THE REVOLVING COMMITMENTS AVAILABLE TO US UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM $200.0 MILLION TO $275.0 MILLION, REDUCE THE INTEREST RATE MARGINS APPLICABLE TO TERM LOANS AND REVOLVING LOANS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM TIME TO TIME AND REDUCE THE COMMITMENT FEE PAYABLE BY US TO THE LENDERS IN RESPECT OF UNUSED REVOLVING COMMITMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. WE EXECUTED THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LENDING CAPACITY WHICH WE COULD USE TO FUND THE COMPLETION OF THE POLARIS DELISTING TRANSACTION, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE EXCESS LENDING CAPACITY IN THE EVENT OF FUTURE OPPORTUNISTIC, STRATEGIC, INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT CONTAINS CUSTOMARY TERMS FOR AMENDMENTS OF THIS TYPE, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS.  \u200b  ON AUGUST 5, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF UP TO $30 MILLION OF OUR COMMON STOCK OVER 12 MONTHS FROM THE APPROVAL DATE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PRICE AND OTHER TRADING RESTRICTIONS AS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPANY. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE REPURCHASED 505,565 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK AT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF $36.93 PER SHARE FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $18.7 MILLION.  \u200b  TO STRENGTHEN OUR DIGITAL ENGINEERING CAPABILITIES AND ESTABLISH A SOLID BASE IN SILICON VALLEY, ON MARCH 12, 2018, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF ETOUCH SYSTEMS CORP (\u201cETOUCH US\u201d), AND ITS INDIAN SUBSIDIARY, ETOUCH SYSTEMS (INDIA) PVT. LTD (\u201cETOUCH INDIA,\u201d TOGETHER WITH ETOUCH US, \u201cETOUCH\u201d) FOR APPROXIMATELY $140.0 MILLION IN CASH, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION, WE SET ASIDE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $15.0 MILLION FOR RETENTION BONUSES TO BE PAID TO ETOUCH MANAGEMENT AND KEY EMPLOYEES, IN EQUAL INSTALLMENTS ON THE FIRST AND SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRANSACTION. WE AGREED TO PAY THE PURCHASE PRICE IN THREE TRANCHES, WITH $80.0 MILLION PAID AT CLOSING, $42.5 MILLION ON THE 12-MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSE OF THE TRANSACTION, AND $17.5 MILLION ON THE 18-MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSE OF THE TRANSACTION, SUBJECT IN EACH CASE TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE PAID THE 12-MONTH ANNIVERSARY PURCHASE PRICE PAYMENT OF $42.5 MILLION AND THE RETENTION BONUS AMOUNT OF $7.0 MILLION TO THE ETOUCH MANAGEMENT AND KEY EMPLOYEES.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE PAID THE 18-MONTH ANNIVERSARY PURCHASE PRICE PAYMENT OF $17.5 MILLION.  \u200b  ON MARCH 3, 2016, OUR INDIAN SUBSIDIARY, VIRTUSA CONSULTING SERVICES PRIVATE LIMITED (\u201cVIRTUSA INDIA\u201d) ACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY 51.7% OF THE FULLY DILUTED SHARES OF POLARIS CONSULTING & SERVICES LIMITED (\u201cPOLARIS\u201d) FOR APPROXIMATELY $168.3 MILLION IN CASH (THE \u201cPOLARIS TRANSACTION\u201d) PURSUANT TO A SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT DATED AS OF NOVEMBER 5, 2015, BY AND AMONG VIRTUSA INDIA, POLARIS AND THE PROMOTER SELLERS NAMED THEREIN. THROUGH A SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE INDIAN RULES ON TAKEOVERS AND SEBI DELISTING REGULATIONS, VIRTUSA INCREASED ITS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN POLARIS FROM 51.7% TO 93.0% BY FEBRUARY 12, 2018 WHEN VIRTUSA CONSUMMATED ITS POLARIS DELISTING OFFER WITH RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS OF POLARIS. THE DELISTING OFFER RESULTED IN AN ACCEPTED EXIT PRICE OF INR 480 PER SHARE (\u201cEXIT PRICE\u201d), FOR AN AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $145.0 MILLION, EXCLUSIVE OF TRANSACTION AND CLOSING COSTS. ON JULY 11, 2018, THE STOCK EXCHANGES ON WHICH POLARIS COMMON SHARES ARE LISTED NOTIFIED POLARIS THAT TRADING IN EQUITY SHARES OF POLARIS WOULD BE DISCONTINUED AND DELISTED EFFECTIVE ON AUGUST 1, 2018. FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR FOLLOWING THE DATE OF DELISTING, VIRTUSA INDIA WILL, IN COMPLIANCE WITH SEBI DELISTING REGULATIONS, PERMIT THE PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS OF POLARIS TO TENDER THEIR SHARES FOR SALE TO VIRTUSA INDIA AT THE EXIT PRICE. IN CONNECTION WITH THE POLARIS DELISTING OFFER, DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 VIRTUSA INDIA PURCHASED 1,263,117 SHARES, OR 1.2%, OF POLARIS COMMON STOCK FROM POLARIS PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $8.7 MILLION. SUBSEQUENT TO THE EXPIRY OF THE DELISTING OFFER PERIOD ON JULY 31, 2019, WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO REDEEM THE SHARES AND ACCORDINGLY THE REMAINING REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST AMOUNTING TO $15.1 MILLION HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO PERMANENT EQUITY.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u200b  IN CONNECTION WITH, AND AS PART OF THE POLARIS ACQUISITION, ON NOVEMBER 5, 2015, WE ENTERED INTO AN AMENDMENT WITH CITIGROUP TECHNOLOGY, INC. (\u201cCITI\u201d) AND POLARIS, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE UPON THE CLOSING OF THE POLARIS TRANSACTION, PURSUANT TO WHICH VIRTUSA WAS ADDED AS A PARTY TO THE MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH CITI AND CITI AGREED TO APPOINT THE COMPANY AND POLARIS AS A PREFERRED VENDOR.  \u200b  ON FEBRUARY 6, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A $450.0 MILLION CREDIT AGREEMENT (\u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH A SYNDICATED BANK GROUP JOINTLY LEAD BY JP MORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. AND MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED, WHICH AMENDS AND RESTATES OUR PRIOR $300.0 MILLION CREDIT AGREEMENT (WHICH WE HAD ORIGINALLY ENTERED INTO ON FEBRUARY 25, 2016 (\u201cPRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) TO FUND THE POLARIS ACQUISITION AND CERTAIN RELATED TRANSACTIONS) AND PROVIDES FOR A $200.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, A $180.0 MILLION TERM LOAN FACILITY, AND A $70.0 MILLION DELAYED-DRAW TERM LOAN. WE DREW DOWN $180.0 MILLION UNDER THE TERM LOAN OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND $55.0 MILLION UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT TO REPAY IN FULL THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE PRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND FUND THE POLARIS DELISTING TRANSACTION. TO FUND THE ETOUCH ACQUISITION AND POLARIS DELISTING OFFER, WE DREW DOWN FROM OUR CREDIT FACILITY. INTEREST UNDER THIS NEW CREDIT FACILITY ACCRUES AT A RATE PER ANNUM OF LIBOR PLUS 3.0%, SUBJECT TO STEP-DOWNS BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S RATIO OF DEBT TO EBITDA. WE ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO MINIMIZE INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES MAXIMUM DEBT TO EBITDA AND MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE COVENANTS. THE TERM OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS FIVE YEARS, ENDING FEBRUARY 6, 2023 (SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION). FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2020, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO MAKE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF $3.1 MILLION PER QUARTER.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY DREW DOWN $27.5 MILLION FROM THE CREDIT FACILITY TO FUND THE ETOUCH 18-MONTH ANNIVERSARY PAYMENT AND TO FUND THE  OPPORTUNISTIC, STRATEGIC, INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES  . AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE OUTSTANDING AMOUNT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS $388.3 MILLION. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE INTEREST RATE ON THE TERM LOAN AND LINE OF CREDIT WAS 4.53%.  \u200b  THE CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS, INCLUDING ALL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ALL SECURITIES IN DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES (OTHER THAN CERTAIN DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES WHERE THE MATERIAL ASSETS OF SUCH SUBSIDIARIES ARE EQUITY IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES), SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY EXCEPTIONS AND EXCLUSIONS FROM THE COLLATERAL. ALL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S MATERIAL DIRECT AND INDIRECT DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. THESE GUARANTEES ARE SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PRESENT AND FUTURE PROPERTY AND ASSETS OF THE GUARANTORS, WITH CERTAIN EXCLUSIONS.  \u200b  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS DEBT COVENANTS AND HAS PROVIDED A QUARTERLY CERTIFICATION TO OUR LENDERS TO THAT EFFECT. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CURRENTLY MEET ALL CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT TO BORROW THEREUNDER AND WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY CONDITIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT US FROM BORROWING PART OR ALL OF THE REMAINING AVAILABLE CAPACITY UNDER THE EXISTING REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND THROUGH THE DATE OF THIS FILING.  \u200b  ON MAY 3, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO AN INVESTMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE OROGEN GROUP (\u201cOROGEN\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH OROGEN PURCHASED 108,000 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S NEWLY ISSUED SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, INITIALLY CONVERTIBLE INTO 3,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $108 MILLION WITH AN INITIAL CONVERSION PRICE OF $36.00 (THE \u201cOROGEN PREFERRED STOCK FINANCING\u201d). IN CONNECTION WITH THE INVESTMENT, VIKRAM S. PANDIT, THE FORMER CEO OF CITIGROUP, WAS APPOINTED TO VIRTUSA\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OROGEN IS A NEW OPERATING COMPANY THAT WAS CREATED BY VIKRAM PANDIT AND ATAIROS GROUP, INC., AN INDEPENDENT PRIVATE COMPANY FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING GROWTH-ORIENTED BUSINESSES, TO LEVERAGE THE OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY THE EVOLUTION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES LANDSCAPE AND TO IDENTIFY AND INVEST IN FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES AND RELATED BUSINESSES WITH PROVEN BUSINESS MODELS.  \u200b  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT, THE SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK HAS A 3.875% DIVIDEND PER ANNUM, PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AND/OR CASH AT OUR OPTION. IF ANY SHARES OF SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK HAVE NOT BEEN CONVERTED INTO COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO MAY 3, 2024, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE SUCH SHARES AT A REPURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO THE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF THE REPURCHASED SHARES PLUS THE AMOUNT OF ACCUMULATED AND UNPAID DIVIDENDS THEREON. IF WE FAIL TO EFFECT SUCH REPURCHASE, THE DIVIDEND RATE ON THE SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK WILL INCREASE BY 1% PER ANNUM AND AN ADDITIONAL 1% PER ANNUM ON EACH ANNIVERSARY OF MAY 3, 2024 DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH FAILURE TO EFFECT THE REPURCHASE IS CONTINUING, EXCEPT THAT THE DIVIDEND RATE WILL NOT INCREASE TO MORE  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THAN 6.875% PER ANNUM. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY PAID $2.1 MILLION AS A CASH DIVIDEND ON ITS SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK.  \u200b  THE COMPANY ALSO USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MITIGATE THE COMPANY\u2019S INTEREST RATE RISK ON THE COMPANY\u2019S VARIABLE RATE DEBT. THE COMPANY\u2019S OBJECTIVE IS TO LIMIT THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN LIBOR INTEREST RATE PAYMENTS DUE ON THE CREDIT AGREEMENT (SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), BY USING PAY-FIXED, RECEIVE-VARIABLE INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO OFFSET THE FUTURE VARIABLE RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY PURCHASED INTEREST RATE SWAPS IN JULY 2016 WITH AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF JULY 2017 AND NOVEMBER 2018.  THE JULY 2016 INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE AT A BLENDED WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF 1.025% AND THE COMPANY WILL RECEIVE 1-MONTH LIBOR ON THE SAME NOTIONAL AMOUNTS.  THE NOVEMBER 2018 INTEREST RATE SWAPS ARE AT A FIXED RATE OF 2.85% AND ARE DESIGNED TO MAINTAIN A 50% COVERAGE OF OUR LIBOR DEBT, THEREFORE THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT CHANGES OVER THE LIFE OF THE SWAP TO RETAIN THE 50% COVERAGE TARGET.  \u200b  THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS COULD DEMAND AN EARLY TERMINATION OF THE JUNE 2016 AND NOVEMBER 2018 SWAP AGREEMENTS IF WE ARE IN DEFAULT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, OR ANY AGREEMENT THAT AMENDS OR REPLACES THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE COUNTERPARTY IS A MEMBER, AND WE ARE UNABLE TO CURE THE DEFAULT. AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING A MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO COMMENCING ON DECEMBER 31, 2018, OF NOT MORE THAN 3.50 TO 1.00 FOR PERIODS ENDING PRIOR TO DECEMBER 31, 2019, OF NOT MORE THAN 3.25 TO 1.00 COMMENCING DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND FOR PERIODS ENDING PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2020, AND 3.00 TO 1.00 THEREAFTER AND A MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF 1.25 TO 1.00. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS. THE NET UNREALIZED LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT WAS $6.4 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT THAT WE WOULD PAY TO THE COUNTERPARTIES IN THE EVENT OF AN EARLY TERMINATION.  \u200b  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $198.5 MILLION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS AND LONG TERM INVESTMENTS, OF WHICH WE HOLD APPROXIMATELY $172.3 MILLION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN NON-U.S. LOCATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN INDIA, SRI LANKA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. CASH IN THESE NON-U.S. LOCATIONS MAY NOT OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE FOR POTENTIAL INVESTMENTS OR OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OR CERTAIN OTHER GEOGRAPHIES WHERE NEEDED, AS WE HAVE STATED THAT THIS CASH IS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN THESE NON-U.S. LOCATIONS. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY PLAN TO REPATRIATE THIS CASH TO THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, IF OUR INTENT WERE TO CHANGE AND WE ELECTED TO REPATRIATE THIS CASH BACK TO THE UNITED STATES, OR THIS CASH WAS DEEMED NO LONGER PERMANENTLY INVESTED, THIS CASH WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL TAXES AND THE CHANGE IN SUCH INTENT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CASH BALANCES AS WELL AS OUR OVERALL STATEMENT OF INCOME. DUE TO VARIOUS METHODS BY WHICH CASH COULD BE REPATRIATED TO THE UNITED STATES IN THE FUTURE, THE AMOUNT OF TAXES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CASH IS DEPENDENT ON CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IF AND WHEN REMITTANCE OCCURS. IN ADDITION, SOME COUNTRIES COULD HAVE TIGHT RESTRICTIONS ON THE MOVEMENT AND EXCHANGE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES WHICH COULD FURTHER LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO USE SUCH FUNDS FOR GLOBAL OPERATIONS OR CAPITAL OR OTHER STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. DUE TO THE VARIOUS METHODS BY WHICH SUCH EARNINGS COULD BE REPATRIATED IN THE FUTURE, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF APPLICABLE TAXES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM SUCH REPATRIATION.  \u200b  FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO ARRANGEMENTS TO DELIVER IT SERVICES THAT INCLUDE UPFRONT PAYMENTS TO OUR CLIENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE TOTAL UNAMORTIZED UPFRONT PAYMENTS RELATED TO THESE SERVICES WERE $36.9 MILLION AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE AMORTIZED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE OVER A BENEFIT PERIOD OF 5 YEARS.  \u200b  BEGINNING IN FISCAL 2009, OUR U.K. SUBSIDIARY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH AN UNRELATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO SELL, WITHOUT RECOURSE, CERTAIN OF ITS EUROPE-BASED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES FROM ONE CLIENT TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE SOLD $16.2 MILLION OF RECEIVABLES UNDER THE TERMS OF THE FINANCING AGREEMENT. FEES PAID PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT WERE NOT MATERIAL DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. NO AMOUNTS WERE DUE UNDER THE FINANCING AGREEMENT AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, BUT WE MAY ELECT TO USE THIS PROGRAM AGAIN IN FUTURE PERIODS. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES THAT THIS OR ANY OTHER FINANCING FACILITIES WILL BE AVAILABLE OR UTILIZED IN THE FUTURE.  \u200b  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAVE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS OF $4.0 MILLION RELATING TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF LAND ACQUIRED IN THE POLARIS ACQUISITION TO HELD FOR SALE. THE DECISION TO SELL THIS LAND WAS MADE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AS PART OF OUR ANNUAL PLANNING PROCESS WHERE WE EVALUATED STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES TO MAXIMIZE RETURN ON OUR CASH AND ASSETS. AS PART OF THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS, WE CONSIDERED PROJECTED  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HEADCOUNT GROWTH IN THIS REGION, AS WELL AS ONGOING COMPLIANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HOLDING THE LAND, AND CONCLUDED THAT OUR CASH, INCLUDING CASH FROM THE SALE OF THIS ASSET, WOULD GENERATE A HIGHER RETURN ELSEWHERE. THE RECLASSIFICATION TO HELD FOR SALE TRIGGERED A REDUCTION IN VALUE TO $9.0 MILLION, WHICH REPRESENTS THE LOWER OF NET BOOK VALUE AND MARKET VALUE.  WE ARE ACTIVELY MARKETING THIS LAND FOR SALE AND EXPECT TO COMPLETE A TRANSACTION OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  \u200b  CASH FLOWS  \u200b  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  SIX MONTHS ENDED  \u200b  \u200b  SEPTEMBER 30,  \u200b  2019  2018  \u200b  \u200b  (IN THOUSANDS)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  \u200b  $23,804  \u200b  $33,283  \u200b  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  \u200b  (14,618)  \u200b  (26,690)  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  \u200b  (11,600)  \u200b  (11,729)  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH  \u200b  (4,012)  \u200b  (11,694)  NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH  \u200b  (6,426)  \u200b  (16,830)  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH, BEGINNING OF YEAR  \u200b  190,113  \u200b  195,236  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH, END OF PERIOD  \u200b  $183,687  \u200b  $178,406  \u200b  \u200b  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  \u200b  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE WORKING CAPITAL AND AN INCREASE IN THE LONG-TERM ASSETS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASE IN THE NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH EXPENSES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  \u200b  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  \u200b  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN OR IMPLIED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SERVICE OUR DEBT AND TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS BORROWINGS UNDER OUR  ABL FACILITY  , REDUCTIONS IN REVENUE FORECASTS, OUR ABILITY TO RENEW OUR BROADCAST LICENSES, CHANGES IN INTEREST  RATES INCLUDING THE TRANSITION FROM LIBOR AS AN INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK TO OTHER POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE REFERENCE RATES, THE  TIMING OF, OUR ABILITY TO COMPLETE ANY ACQUISITIONS OR DISPOSITIONS, COSTS AND SYNERGIES RESULTING FROM THE INTEGRATION OF ANY COMPLETED ACQUISITIONS, OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE COSTS, OUR ABILITY TO DRIVE AND MANAGE GROWTH, THE POPULARITY OF RADIO AS A BROADCASTING AND ADVERTISING MEDIUM, CHANGES IN CONSUMER TASTES, THE IMPACT OF GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN SPECIFIC MARKETS IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, INDUSTRY CONDITIONS, INCLUDING EXISTING COMPETITION AND FUTURE COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND CANCELLATION, DISRUPTIONS OR POSTPONEMENTS OF ADVERTISING SCHEDULES IN RESPONSE TO NATIONAL OR WORLD EVENTS, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES FROM NEW SOURCES, INCLUDING LOCAL COMMERCE AND TECHNOLOGY-BASED INITIATIVES, THE IMPACT OF REGULATORY RULES OR PROCEEDINGS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THE FUTURE WRITE OFF OF ANY MATERIAL PORTION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FCC BROADCAST LICENSES AND GOODWILL.  CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE PRIOR YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.  OVERVIEW  WE HAVE THREE OPERATING SEGMENTS  : (1) BROADCAST, (2) DIGITAL MEDIA, AND (3) PUBLISHING, WHICH ALSO QUALIFY AS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. OUR  OPERATING SEGMENTS REFLECT HOW  OUR  CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKERS, WHICH WE DEFINE AS A COLLECTIVE GROUP OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES, ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT AND DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ALLOCATIONS OF RESOURCES TO EACH SEGMENT. WE CONTINUALLY REVIEW OUR OPERATING SEGMENT CLASSIFICATIONS TO ALIGN WITH OPERATIONAL CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND MAY MAKE CHANGES AS NECESSARY.  WE MEASURE AND EVALUATE OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING EXPENSES THAT EXCLUDE COSTS RELATED TO CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE, HUMAN RESOURCES, LEGAL, TAX AND TREASURY. WE ALSO EXCLUDE COSTS SUCH AS AMORTIZATION, DEPRECIATION, TAXES AND INTEREST EXPENSE WHEN EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS.  OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF BROADCAST REVENUE INCLUDE.  \u2022  THE SALE OF BLOCK PROGRAM TIME TO NATIONAL AND LOCAL PROGRAM PRODUCERS;  \u2022  THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME ON OUR RADIO STATIONS TO NATIONAL AND LOCAL ADVERTISERS;  \u2022  THE SALE OF BANNER ADVERTISEMENTS ON OUR STATION WEBSITES OR ON OUR MOBILE APPLICATIONS;  \u2022  THE SALE OF DIGITAL STREAMING ADVERTISEMENTS ON OUR STATION WEBSITES OR ON OUR MOBILE APPLICATIONS;  \u2022  THE SALE OF ADVERTISEMENTS INCLUDED IN DIGITAL NEWSLETTERS;  \u2022  FEES EARNED FOR THE CREATION OF CUSTOM WEB PAGES AND CUSTOM DIGITAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS FOR OUR ADVERTISERS THROUGH SALEM SURROUND;  \u2022  THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME ON OUR NATIONAL NETWORK;  \u2022  THE SYNDICATION OF PROGRAMMING ON OUR NATIONAL NETWORK;  \u2022  PRODUCT SALES AND ROYALTIES FOR ON-AIR HOST MATERIALS, INCLUDING PODCASTS AND PROGRAMS; AND  \u2022  OTHER REVENUE SUCH AS EVENTS, INCLUDING TICKET SALES AND SPONSORSHIPS, LISTENER PURCHASE PROGRAMS, WHERE REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM SPECIAL DISCOUNTS AND INCENTIVES OFFERED TO OUR LISTENERS FROM OUR ADVERTISERS; TALENT FEES FOR VOICE-OVERS OR CUSTOM ENDORSEMENTS FROM OUR ON-AIR PERSONALITIES AND PRODUCTION SERVICES, AND RENTAL INCOME FOR STUDIOS, TOWERS OR OFFICE SPACE.  41  OUR  PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF DIGITAL MEDIA REVENUE INCLUDE.  \u2022  THE SALE OF DIGITAL BANNER ADVERTISEMENTS ON OUR WEBSITES AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS;  \u2022  THE SALE OF DIGITAL STREAMING ADVERTISEMENTS ON WEBSITES AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS;  \u2022  THE SUPPORT AND PROMOTION TO STREAM THIRD-PARTY CONTENT ON OUR WEBSITES;  \u2022  THE SALE OF ADVERTISEMENTS INCLUDED IN DIGITAL NEWSLETTERS;  \u2022  THE DIGITAL DELIVERY OF NEWSLETTERS TO SUBSCRIBERS; AND  \u2022  THE NUMBER OF VIDEO AND GRAPHIC DOWNLOADS.  OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF PUBLISHING REVENUE INCLUDE.  \u2022  THE SALE OF BOOKS AND E-BOOKS;  \u2022  PUBLISHING FEES FROM AUTHORS;  \u2022  THE SALE OF DIGITAL ADVERTISING ON OUR MAGAZINE WEBSITES AND DIGITAL NEWSLETTERS;  \u2022  SUBSCRIPTION FEES FOR OUR PRINT MAGAZINE; AND  \u2022  THE SALE OF PRINT MAGAZINE ADVERTISING.  IN EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, THE RATES WE ARE ABLE TO CHARGE FOR AIR-TIME, ADVERTISING AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  AUDIENCE SHARE;  \u2022  HOW WELL OUR PROGRAMS AND ADVERTISEMENTS PERFORM FOR OUR CLIENTS;  \u2022  THE SIZE OF THE MARKET AND AUDIENCE REACHED;  \u2022  THE NUMBER OF IMPRESSIONS DELIVERED;  \u2022  THE NUMBER OF ADVERTISEMENTS AND PROGRAMS STREAMED;  \u2022  THE NUMBER OF PAGE VIEWS ACHIEVED;  \u2022  THE NUMBER OF DOWNLOADS COMPLETED;  \u2022  THE NUMBER OF EVENTS HELD, THE NUMBER OF EVENT SPONSORSHIPS SOLD AND THE ATTENDANCE AT EACH EVENT;  \u2022  DEMAND FOR BOOKS AND PUBLICATIONS;  \u2022  GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; AND  \u2022  SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR AIR-TIME ON A LOCAL AND NATIONAL LEVEL.  BROADCASTING  OUR FOUNDATIONAL BUSINESS IS RADIO BROADCASTING, WHICH INCLUDES THE OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF RADIO STATIONS IN LARGE METROPOLITAN MARKETS,  OUR NATIONAL NETWORKS AND OUR NATIONAL SALES FIRMS INCLUDING SALEM SURROUND. REVENUES GENERATED FROM OUR RADIO STATIONS, NETWORKS AND SALES FIRMS ARE REPORTED AS BROADCAST MEDIA REVENUE IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECORDED ON A GROSS BASIS UNLESS AN AGENCY REPRESENTS THE ADVERTISER, IN WHICH CASE, REVENUE IS REPORTED NET OF THE COMMISSION RETAINED BY THE AGENCY.  BROADCAST REVENUES ARE IMPACTED BY THE RATES RADIO STATIONS CAN CHARGE FOR PROGRAMMING AND ADVERTISING TIME, THE LEVEL OF AIRTIME SOLD TO PROGRAMMERS AND ADVERTISERS, THE NUMBER OF IMPRESSIONS DELIVERED OR DOWNLOADS MADE, AND THE NUMBER OF EVENTS HELD, INCLUDING THE SIZE OF THE EVENT AND THE NUMBER OF ATTENDEES. BLOCK PROGRAMMING RATES ARE BASED UPON OUR STATIONS\u2019 ABILITY TO ATTRACT AUDIENCES THAT WILL SUPPORT THE PROGRAM PRODUCERS THROUGH CONTRIBUTIONS AND PURCHASES OF THEIR PRODUCTS. ADVERTISING RATES ARE BASED UPON THE DEMAND FOR ADVERTISING TIME, WHICH IN TURN IS BASED ON OUR STATIONS AND NETWORKS\u2019 ABILITY TO PRODUCE RESULTS FOR THEIR ADVERTISERS. WE MARKET OURSELVES TO ADVERTISERS BASED ON THE RESPONSIVENESS OF OUR AUDIENCES. WE DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO TRADITIONAL AUDIENCE MEASURING SERVICES FOR MOST OF OUR RADIO STATIONS. IN SELECT MARKETS, WE SUBSCRIBE TO NIELSEN AUDIO, WHICH DEVELOPS MONTHLY REPORTS MEASURING A RADIO STATION\u2019S AUDIENCE SHARE IN THE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS TARGETED BY ADVERTISERS. EACH OF OUR RADIO STATIONS AND OUR NETWORKS HAS A PRE-DETERMINED LEVEL OF TIME AVAILABLE FOR BLOCK PROGRAMMING AND/OR ADVERTISING, WHICH MAY VARY AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE DAY.  NIELSEN AUDIO USES THE PORTABLE PEOPLE METER  TM  (\u201cPPM  \u201d  ) TECHNOLOGY TO COLLECT DATA FOR ITS RATINGS SERVICE. PPM IS A SMALL DEVICE THAT IS CAPABLE OF AUTOMATICALLY MEASURING RADIO, TELEVISION, INTERNET, SATELLITE RADIO AND SATELLITE TELEVISION SIGNALS ENCODED BY THE BROADCASTER. THE PPM OFFERS A NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES OVER TRADITIONAL DIARY RATINGS COLLECTION SYSTEMS, INCLUDING EASE OF USE, MORE RELIABLE RATINGS DATA, SHORTER TIME PERIODS BETWEEN WHEN ADVERTISING RUNS AND ACTUAL LISTENING DATA, AND LITTLE MANIPULATION OF DATA BY USERS. A DISADVANTAGE OF THE PPM INCLUDES DATA FLUCTUATIONS FROM CHANGES TO THE \u201cPANEL\u201d (A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS HOLDING PPM DEVICES). THIS MAKES ALL STATIONS SUSCEPTIBLE TO SOME INCONSISTENCIES IN RATINGS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF LISTENERS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. WE SUBSCRIBE TO NIELSEN AUDIO FOR RATINGS SERVICES IN ONLY 22 OF OUR MARKETS.  42  AS IS TYPICAL IN THE RADIO BROADCASTING INDUSTRY, OUR SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTER ADVERTISING REVENUE GENERALLY EXCEEDS OUR FIRST AND THIR  D QUARTER ADVERTISIN  G REVENUE.  THIS SEASONAL FLUCTUATION IN ADVERTISING REVENUE CORRESPONDS WITH QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS IN TH  E RETAIL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY.  ADDITIONALLY, WE EXPERIENCE INCREASED DEMAND FOR ADVERTISING DURING ELECTION YEARS BY WAY OF POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENTS.  D  URING ELECTION YEARS, OR EVEN NUMBERED YEARS, WE BENEFIT FROM A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE OVER NON-E  LECTION OR ODD NUMBERED YEARS.  POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE VARIES BASED ON THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF CANDIDATES AS WELL AS THE NU  MBER AND TYPE OF  DEBATED ISSUES.  QUARTERLY BLOCK PROGRAMMING REVENUE TENDS NOT TO VARY  SIGNIFICANTLY  BECAUSE PROGRAM RATES  ARE GENERALLY SET ANNUALLY AND  RECOGNIZED ON A PER PROGRAM BASIS.  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM BROADCASTING ARE AFFECTED BY TRANSITIONAL PERIODS EXPERIENCED BY RADIO STATIONS WHEN, BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE RADIO STATION, OUR PLANS FOR THE MARKET AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES, WE FIND IT BENEFICIAL TO CHANGE THE STATION FORMAT. DURING THIS TRANSITIONAL PERIOD, WHEN WE DEVELOP A RADIO STATION\u2019S LISTENER AND CUSTOMER BASE, THE STATION MAY GENERATE NEGATIVE OR INSIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW.  IN BROADCASTING, TRADE OR BARTER AGREEMENTS ARE COMMONLY USED TO  REDUCE CASH EXPENSES BY EXCHANGING ADVERTISING TIME FOR GOODS OR SERVICES  . WE MAY ENTER BARTER AGREEMENTS TO EXCHANGE AIR TIME OR DIGITAL ADVERTISING FOR GOODS OR SERVICES THAT CAN BE USED IN OUR BUSINESS OR THAT CAN BE SOLD TO OUR AUDIENCE UNDER LISTENER PURCHASE PROGRAMS. THE TERMS OF THESE BARTER AGREEMENTS PERMIT US TO PREEMPT THE BARTER AIR TIME OR DIGITAL CAMPAIGN IN FAVOR OF CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASE THE AIR TIME OR DIGITAL CAMPAIGN FOR CASH. THE VALUE OF THESE NON-CASH EXCHANGES IS INCLUDED IN REVENUE IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES WE RECEIVE. EACH TRANSACTION IS REVIEWED TO DETERMINE THAT THE PRODUCTS, SUPPLIES AND/OR SERVICES WE RECEIVE HAVE ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE, OR VALUE TO US. WE RECORD BARTER OPERATING EXPENSES UPON RECEIPT AND USAGE OF THE PRODUCTS, SUPPLIES AND SERVICES, AS APPLICABLE. WE RECORD BARTER REVENUE AS ADVERTISING SPOTS OR DIGITAL CAMPAIGNS ARE DELIVERED, WHICH REPRESENTS THE POINT IN TIME THAT CONTROL IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER THEREBY COMPLETING OUR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. BARTER REVENUE IS RECORDED ON A GROSS BASIS UNLESS AN AGENCY REPRESENTS THE PROGRAMMER, IN WHICH CASE, REVENUE IS REPORTED NET OF THE COMMISSION RETAINED BY THE AGENCY. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, 97% OF OUR BROADCAST REVENUE WAS SOLD FOR CASH.  BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE: (I) EMPLOYEE SALARIES, COMMISSIONS AND RELATED EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND TAXES, (II) FACILITY EXPENSES SUCH AS LEASE COST AND UTILITIES, (III) MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES, (IV) PRODUCTION AND PROGRAMMING EXPENSES, AND (V) MUSIC LICENSE FEES. IN ADDITION TO THESE EXPENSES, OUR NETWORK INCURS PROGRAMMING COSTS AND LEASE EXPENSES FOR SATELLITE COMMUNICATION FACILITIES.  DIGITAL MEDIA  WEB-BASED AND DIGITAL CONTENT CONTINUES TO BE A FOCUS OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT. OUR DIGITAL MEDIA BASED BUSINESSES PROVIDE CHRISTIAN, CONSERVATIVE, INVESTING AND HEALTH-THEMED CONTENT, E-COMMERCE, AUDIO AND VIDEO STREAMING, AND OTHER RESOURCES DIGITALLY THROUGH THE WEB. REVENUES GENERATED THIS SEGMENT ARE REPORTED AS DIGITAL MEDIA REVENUE IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  DIGITAL MEDIA REVENUES ARE IMPACTED BY THE RATES OUR SITES CAN CHARGE FOR ADVERTISING TIME, THE LEVEL OF ADVERTISEMENTS SOLD, THE NUMBER OF IMPRESSIONS DELIVERED OR THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS SOLD AND THE NUMBER OF DIGITAL SUBSCRIPTIONS SOLD. LIKE OUR BROADCASTING SEGMENT, OUR SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTER ADVERTISING REVENUE GENERALLY EXCEEDS OUR FIRST AND THIRD QUARTER ADVERTISING REVENUE. THIS SEASONAL FLUCTUATION IN ADVERTISING REVENUE CORRESPONDS WITH QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE RETAIL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY. WE ALSO EXPERIENCE FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER COMPARISONS BASED ON THE DATE ON WHICH THE EASTER HOLIDAY IS OBSERVED, AS THIS HOLIDAY GENERATES A HIGHER VOLUME OF PRODUCT DOWNLOADS FROM OUR CHURCH PRODUCT SITES. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXPERIENCE INCREASED DEMAND FOR ADVERTISING TIME AND PLACEMENT DURING ELECTION YEARS FOR POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENTS.  DIGITAL MEDIA OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE: (I) EMPLOYEE SALARIES, COMMISSIONS AND RELATED EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND TAXES, (II) FACILITY EXPENSES SUCH AS LEASE COSTS AND UTILITIES, (III) MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES, (IV) ROYALTIES, (V) STREAMING COSTS, AND (VI) COST OF GOODS SOLD ASSOCIATED WITH E-COMMERCE SITES.  PUBLISHING  OUR PUBLISHING OPERATIONS INCLUDE BOOK PUBLISHING THROUGH REGNERY  \u00ae  PUBLISHING, A PRINT MAGAZINE AND OUR SELF-PUBLISHING SERVICES. REVENUES GENERATED FROM THIS SEGMENT ARE REPORTED AS PUBLISHING REVENUE IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  PUBLISHING REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY THE NUMBER AND THE RETAIL PRICE OF BOOKS AND E-BOOKS SOLD, THE NUMBER AND RATE OF PRINT MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTIONS SOLD, THE RATE AND NUMBER OF PAGES OF ADVERTISEMENTS SOLD IN EACH PRINT MAGAZINE, AND THE NUMBER AND RATE AT WHICH SELF-PUBLISHED BOOKS ARE PUBLISHED. REGNERY  \u00ae  PUBLISHING REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY ELECTIONS AS IT GENERATES HIGHER LEVELS OF INTEREST AND DEMAND FOR PUBLICATIONS CONTAINING CONSERVATIVE AND POLITICAL BASED OPINIONS.  PUBLISHING OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE: (I) EMPLOYEE SALARIES, COMMISSIONS AND RELATED EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND TAXES, (II) FACILITY EXPENSES SUCH AS LEASE COSTS AND UTILITIES, (III) MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES; AND (IV) COST OF GOODS SOLD THAT INCLUDES PRINTING AND PRODUCTION COSTS, FULFILLMENT COSTS, AUTHOR ROYALTIES AND INVENTORY RESERVES.  43  KNOWN TRENDS AND  UNCERTAINTIES  WE BELIEVE THAT BROADCAST REVENUE GROWTH REMAINS CHALLENGED  DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING INCREASING COMPETITION FROM OTHER FORMS OF CONTENT DISTRIBUTION AND TIME SPENT LISTENING BY AUDIO STREAMING SERVICES,  PODCASTS AND SATELLITE RADIO.  THIS INCREASE IN COMPETITION AND MIX OF RADIO LISTENING TIME MAY LEAD ADVERTISERS TO CONCLUDE THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RADIO HAS DIMINISHED. TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS, WE CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR DIGITAL ASSETS TO COMPLEMENT OUR BROADCAST CONTENT. THE INCREASE USE OF VOICE ACTIVATED PLATFORMS, OR SMART SPEAKERS, THAT PROVIDE AUDIENCES WITH THE ABILITY TO ACCESS AM AND FM RADIO STATIONS SHOW INCREASED POTENTIAL FOR BROADCASTERS TO REACH AUDIENCES.  OUR BROADCAST REVENUES ARE PARTICULARLY DEPENDENT ON ADVERTISING FROM OUR LOS ANGELES AND DALLAS MARKETS, WHICH GENERATED 15.1% AND 20.5%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR NET BROADCAST ADVERTISING REVENUE DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  REVENUES FROM PRINT MAGAZINES, INCLUDING ADVERTISING REVENUE AND SUBSCRIPTION REVENUES, ARE CHALLENGED DUE TO LOWER DEMAND FROM THE AUDIENCES THAT INCREASINGLY USE OTHER MEDIUMS THAT DELIVER COMPARABLE INFORMATION. BOOK SALES ARE CONTINGENT UPON OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN AUTHORS. B  ECAUSE DIGITAL MEDIA HAS BEEN A GROWTH AREA FOR US, DECREASES IN DIGITAL REVENUE STREAMS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. DIGITAL REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY THE NATURE AND DELIVERY OF PAGE VIEWS. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A SHIFT IN THE NUMBER OF PAGE VIEWS FROM DESKTOP DEVICES TO MOBILE DEVICES. WHILE MOBILE PAGE VIEWS HAVE INCREASED DRAMATICALLY, THEY CARRY A LOWER NUMBER OF ADVERTISEMENTS PER PAGE WHICH ARE GENERALLY SOLD AT LOWER RATES. DIGITAL MEDIA REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY PAGE VIEWS AND THE NUMBER OF ADVERTISEMENTS PER PAGE. DECLINES IN DESKTOP PAGE VIEWS NEGATIVELY IMPACT REVENUE AS MOBILE DEVICES CARRY LOWER RATES AND LESS ADVERTISEMENT PER PAGE. TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT THAT ANY ONE OF THESE AREAS COULD HAVE, WE CONTINUE  TO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES TO CROSS-PROMOTE OUR BRANDS AND OUR CONTENT, AND TO STRATEGICALLY MONITOR COSTS.  WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRICES, SEEK TO RENEW OR RENEGOTIATE LEASE TERMS UNDER A \u201cBLEND AND EXTEND\u201d OPTION THAT WE BELIEVE PROVIDES US WITH FAVORABLE LEASE TERMS OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD FROM FIVE TO TWENTY YEARS. AS LEASE EXPENSE IS RECORDED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM, WE EXPECT OUR LEASE EXPENSE TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $0.6 MILLION PER ANNUM AS COMPARED TO PRIOR PERIODS. ACTUAL CASH PAYMENTS FOR LEASED PROPERTIES ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN CONSISTENT WITH ANNUAL INCREASES OF GENERALLY UP TO 3% OR A PERCENTAGE OF THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX.  KEY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS \u2013 SAME-STATION DEFINITION  IN THE DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BELOW, WE COMPARE OUR BROADCAST OPERATING RESULTS BETWEEN PERIODS ON AN AS-REPORTED BASIS, WHICH INCLUDES THE OPERATING RESULTS OF ALL RADIO STATIONS AND NETWORKS OWNED OR OPERATED AT ANY TIME DURING EITHER PERIOD AND ON A SAME STATION BASIS. SAME STATION IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE USED BOTH IN PRESENTING OUR RESULTS TO STOCKHOLDERS AND THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY AS WELL AS IN OUR INTERNAL EVALUATIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME PROVIDES A MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF PERIOD OVER PERIOD PERFORMANCE OF OUR CORE BROADCAST OPERATIONS AS THIS MEASURE EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF NEW STATIONS, THE IMPACT OF STATIONS WE NO LONGER OWN OR OPERATE, AND THE IMPACT OF STATIONS OPERATING UNDER A NEW PROGRAMMING FORMAT. OUR PRESENTATION OF SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME IS NOT INTENDED TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURES REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. OUR DEFINITION OF SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME IS NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. REFER TO \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d BELOW FOR A RECONCILIATION OF THESE NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURES.  WE DEFINE SAME STATION NET BROADCAST REVENUE AS NET BROADCAST REVENUE FROM OUR RADIO STATIONS AND NETWORKS THAT WE OWN OR OPERATE IN THE SAME FORMAT ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF EACH QUARTER, AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. WE DEFINE SAME STATION BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES AS BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES FROM OUR RADIO STATIONS AND NETWORKS THAT WE OWN OR OPERATE IN THE SAME FORMAT ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF EACH QUARTER, AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES THOSE STATIONS WE OWN OR OPERATE IN THE SAME FORMAT ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF EACH QUARTER, AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME FOR A FULL CALENDAR YEAR IS CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF THE SAME STATION RESULTS FOR EACH OF THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THAT YEAR.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  MANAGEMENT USES  CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES DEFINED BELOW IN COMMUNICATIONS WITH INVESTORS, ANALYSTS, RATING AGENCIES, BANKS AND OTHERS TO ASSIST SUCH PARTIES IN UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF VARIOUS ITEMS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE USE THESE  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO EVALUATE FINANCIAL RESULTS, DEVELOP BUDGETS, MANAGE EXPENDITURES AND AS A MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE UNDER COMPENSATION PROGRAMS.  OUR PRESENTATION OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURES AS REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  ITEM 101 OF REGULATION S-K DEFINES AND PRESCRIBES THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION MAY BE PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT. WE CLOSELY MONITOR EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA, STATION OPERATING INCOME (\u201cSOI\u201d), SAME STATION NET BROADCAST REVENUE, SAME STATION BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES, SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME, DIGITAL MEDIA OPERATING INCOME, AND PUBLISHING OPERATING INCOME, ALL OF WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CORE OPERATING RESULTS, AND THUS, ARE APPROPRIATE TO ENHANCE THE OVERALL UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR UNDERLYING OPERATIONAL RESULTS, TRENDS AND PERFORMANCE.  44  THE PERFORMANCE OF A RADIO BROADCASTING COMPANY IS CUSTOMARILY MEASURED BY THE ABILITY OF ITS STATIONS TO GENERATE  SOI.  WE DEFINE SOI AS NET BROADCAST REVENUE LESS  BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES.  ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN NET BROADCAST REVENUE AND  BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES, AS EXPLAINED ABOVE, HAVE A DI  RECT IMPACT ON CHANGES IN SOI.  SOI IS NOT A MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE CALCU  LATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  SOI  SHOULD BE VIEWED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO AND NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PRE  SENTED ON THE BASIS OF GAAP.  WE BELIEVE THAT SOI IS A USEFUL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE TO INVESTORS WHEN CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OPERATING INCOME (  THE  MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE  S TO SOI  ), BECAUSE IT IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED BY T  HE RADIO BROADCASTING INDUSTRY AS A TOOL IN MEASURING PERFORMANCE AND IN APPLYING VALUATION METHODOLOGIES FOR COMPANIES IN THE MEDIA, ENTERTAINMENT  AND COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES.  SOI IS  COMMONLY  USED BY INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS WHO REPORT ON THE INDUSTRY TO  PROVIDE COMPARISON  S BETWEEN BROADCASTING GROUPS.  WE USE SOI AS ONE OF THE KEY MEASURES OF OPERATING EFFICIENCY  AND  PROFITABILITY  , INCLUDING  OUR INTERNAL REVIEW  S  ASSOCIATED WITH IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS OF  OUR  INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  SOI DOES NOT PUR  PORT TO REPRESENT CASH PRO  VIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  OUR STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS PRESENTS OUR CASH ACTIVITY  IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP  AND OUR INCOME STATEMENT PRESENTS OUR  FINANCIAL  PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  OUR DEFINITION OF SOI IS N  OT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  WE DEFINE SAME STATION NET BROADCAST REVENUE AS NET BROADCAST REVENUE FROM OUR RADIO STATIONS AND NETWORKS THAT WE OWN OR OPERATE IN THE SAME FORMAT ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF EACH QUARTER, AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. WE DEFINE SAME STATION BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES AS BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES FROM OUR RADIO STATIONS AND NETWORKS THAT WE OWN OR OPERATE IN THE SAME FORMAT ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF EACH QUARTER, AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES THOSE STATIONS WE OWN OR OPERATE IN THE SAME FORMAT ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF EACH QUARTER, AS WELL AS THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME FOR A FULL CALENDAR YEAR IS CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF THE SAME STATION-RESULTS FOR EACH OF THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THAT YEAR. WE USE SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, BOTH IN PRESENTING OUR RESULTS TO STOCKHOLDERS AND THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY, AND IN OUR INTERNAL EVALUATIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THE BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME PROVIDES A MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF PERIOD OVER PERIOD PERFORMANCE OF OUR CORE BROADCAST OPERATIONS AS THIS MEASURE EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF NEW STATIONS, THE IMPACT OF STATIONS WE NO LONGER OWN OR OPERATE, AND THE IMPACT OF STATIONS OPERATING UNDER A NEW PROGRAMMING FORMAT. OUR PRESENTATION OF SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME IS NOT INTENDED TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURES REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. OUR DEFINITION OF SAME STATION NET BROADCAST REVENUE, SAME STATION BROADCAST OPERATING EXPENSES AND SAME STATION OPERATING INCOME IS NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  WE APPLY A SIMILAR METHODOLOGY TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA AND PUBLISHING GROUP. DIGITAL MEDIA OPERATING INCOME IS DEFINED AS NET DIGITAL MEDIA REVENUE LESS DIGITAL MEDIA OPERATING EXPENSES. PUBLISHING OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) IS DEFINED AS NET PUBLISHING REVENUE LESS PUBLISHING OPERATING EXPENSES. DIGITAL MEDIA OPERATING INCOME AND PUBLISHING OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) ARE NOT MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. OUR PRESENTATIONS OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE NOT TO BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE BELIEVE THAT DIGITAL MEDIA OPERATING INCOME AND PUBLISHING OPERATING INCOME ARE USEFUL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO INVESTORS, WHEN CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OPERATING INCOME (THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE), BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED TO MEASURE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BROADCASTING ENTITIES. WE USE THIS ANALYSIS AS ONE OF THE KEY MEASURES OF OPERATING EFFICIENCY, PROFITABILITY AND IN OUR INTERNAL REVIEW. THIS MEASUREMENT DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. OUR STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS PRESENTS OUR CASH ACTIVITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND OUR INCOME STATEMENT PRESENTS OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. OUR DEFINITIONS OF DIGITAL MEDIA OPERATING INCOME AND PUBLISHING OPERATING INCOME ARE NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN FOR REGNERY PUBLISHING WAS 57% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO 58% FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. REGNERY PUBLISHING MARGINS ARE IMPACTED BY THE VOLUME OF E-BOOK SALES, WHICH HAVE HIGHER MARGINS DUE TO THE NATURE OF DELIVERY AND LACK OF SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES.

THE DECREASE OF $0.6 MILLION REFLECTS THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE NOTES, THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE ABL AND FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. FUTURE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WILL NOT IMPACT OUR FIXED RATE NOTES, BUT AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES MAY IMPACT THE VARIABLE RATE AT WHICH WE CAN BORROW UNDER OUR ABL FACILITY AND RESULT IN HIGHER INTEREST CHARGES. THE LIBOR RATE SCHEDULED TO BE DISCONTINUED AT THE END OF CALENDAR YEAR 2021 WOULD RESULT IN ALL OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS SUBJECT TO THE HIGHER BASE RATE BORROWING. WE EXPECT TO AMEND THE ABL PRIOR TO THE LIBOR PHASEOUT BASED ON THE ABL MATURITY DATE OF MAY 19, 2022.  THE GAIN ON THE EARLY RETIREMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT REFLECTS $6.7 MILLION OF REPURCHASES OF THE NOTES AT PRICES BELOW FACE VALUE RESULTING IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $0.4 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $0.2 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR EACH PERIOD DIFFERS FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY INCOME RATE OF 21.0% DUE TO THE EFFECT OF THE SALE OF BUSINESS ASSETS IN VARIOUS STATES, STATE INCOME TAXES, CERTAIN EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES, AND CHANGES IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  SIGNIFICANT AREAS FOR WHICH MANAGEMENT USES ESTIMATES INCLUDE.  \u2022  REVENUE RECOGNITION,  \u2022  ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, INCLUDING BROADCASTING LICENSES, GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS;  \u2022  PROBABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION;  \u2022  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS;  \u2022  CONTINGENCY RESERVES;  \u2022  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS;  60  \u2022  SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES;  \u2022  BARTER TRANSACTIONS;  \u2022  INVENTORY RESERVES;  \u2022  RESERVES FOR ROYALTY ADVANCES;  \u2022  FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY AWARDS;  \u2022  SELF-INSURANCE RESERVES;  \u2022  ESTIMATED LIVES FOR TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS;  \u2022  ASSESSMENT OF CONTRACT-BASED FACTORS, ASSET-BASED FACTORS, ENTITY-BASED FACTORS AND MARKET-BASED FACTORS TO DETERMINE THE LEASE TERM IMPACTING RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES,  \u2022  DETERMINING THE INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE (\u201cIBR\u201d) FOR CALCULATING ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES  \u2022  INCOME TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES; AND  \u2022  UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS  THESE ESTIMATES REQUIRE THE USE OF JUDGMENT AS FUTURE EVENTS AND THE EFFECT OF THESE EVENTS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. THE ESTIMATES WILL CHANGE AS NEW EVENTS OCCUR, AS MORE EXPERIENCE IS ACQUIRED AND AS MORE INFORMATION IS OBTAINED. WE EVALUATE AND UPDATE OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND WE MAY CONSULT OUTSIDE EXPERTS TO ASSIST AS CONSIDERED NECESSARY.  WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE RELATED JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ARE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT AFFECT THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES MUST BE MADE IN CONNECTION WITH DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE TO BE RECOGNIZED IN ANY ACCOUNTING PERIOD. WE MUST ASSESS THE PROMISES WITHIN EACH SALES CONTRACT TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. ONCE THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION(S) ARE DETERMINED, THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION(S) BASED ON A RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE BASIS. IF A SALES CONTRACT CONTAINS A SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, THE ENTIRE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO THE SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. CONTRACTS THAT CONTAIN MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS REQUIRE AN ALLOCATION OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BASED ON A RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE. IF THE STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICE IS NOT DETERMINABLE, AN ESTIMATE IS USED.  WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES RELATED TO VARIABLE CONSIDERATION AT THE POINT OF SALE, INCLUDING ESTIMATES FOR REFUNDS AND PRODUCT RETURNS. UNDER ASC TOPIC 606, ESTIMATES OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION ARE TO BE RECOGNIZED BEFORE CONTINGENCIES ARE RESOLVED IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL IN THE AMOUNT OF ANY ESTIMATED CUMULATIVE REVENUE WILL NOT OCCUR.  A GROWING SOURCE OF REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM DIGITAL PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WHICH ALLOW FOR ENHANCED AUDIENCE INTERACTION AND PARTICIPATION, AND INTEGRATED DIGITAL ADVERTISING SOLUTIONS. WHEN OFFERING DIGITAL PRODUCTS, ANOTHER PARTY MAY BE INVOLVED IN PROVIDING THE GOODS OR SERVICES THAT MAKE UP A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION TO THE CUSTOMER. THESE INCLUDE THE USE OF THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES FOR SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS. WE MUST EVALUATE IF WE ARE THE PRINCIPAL OR AGENT IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF REVENUE SHOULD BE REPORTED GROSS AS PRINCIPAL OR NET AS AGENT. IN THIS EVALUATION, WE CONSIDER IF WE OBTAIN CONTROL OF THE SPECIFIED GOODS OR SERVICES BEFORE THEY ARE TRANSFERRED TO OUR CUSTOMER, AS WELL AS OTHER INDICATORS SUCH AS THE PARTY PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR FULFILLMENT, INVENTORY RISK, AND DISCRETION IN ESTABLISHING PRICE. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER WE CONTROL A SPECIFIED GOOD OR SERVICE IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE GOOD OR SERVICE BEING TRANSFERRED REQUIRES US TO MAKE REASONABLE JUDGMENTS ON THE NATURE OF EACH AGREEMENT. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT WE ARE ACTING AS PRINCIPAL WHEN WE MANAGE ALL ASPECTS OF A SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN, INCLUDING REVIEWING AND APPROVING TARGET AUDIENCES, MONITORING ACTUAL RESULTS AND MAKING MODIFICATIONS AS NEEDED AND WHEN WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING CAMPAIGN RESULTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS REGARDLESS OF THE USE OF A THIRD-PARTY OR PARTIES.  TRADE AND BARTER TRANSACTIONS  IN BROADCASTING, TRADE OR BARTER AGREEMENTS ARE COMMONLY USED TO  REDUCE CASH EXPENSES BY EXCHANGING ADVERTISING TIME FOR GOODS OR SERVICES  . WE MAY ENTER BARTER AGREEMENTS TO EXCHANGE AIR TIME OR DIGITAL ADVERTISING FOR GOODS OR SERVICES THAT CAN BE USED IN OUR BUSINESS OR THAT CAN BE SOLD TO OUR AUDIENCE UNDER LISTENER PURCHASE PROGRAMS. THE TERMS OF THESE BARTER AGREEMENTS PERMIT US TO PREEMPT THE BARTER AIR TIME OR DIGITAL CAMPAIGN IN FAVOR OF CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASE THE AIR TIME OR DIGITAL CAMPAIGN FOR CASH. THE VALUE OF THESE NON-CASH EXCHANGES IS INCLUDED IN REVENUE IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES WE RECEIVE. EACH TRANSACTION MUST BE REVIEWED TO DETERMINE THAT THE PRODUCTS, SUPPLIES AND/OR SERVICES WE RECEIVE HAVE ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE, OR VALUE TO US. WE RECORD BARTER OPERATING EXPENSES UPON RECEIPT AND USAGE OF THE PRODUCTS, SUPPLIES AND SERVICES, AS APPLICABLE. WE RECORD BARTER REVENUE AS ADVERTISING SPOTS OR DIGITAL CAMPAIGNS ARE DELIVERED, WHICH REPRESENTS THE POINT IN TIME THAT CONTROL IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER THEREBY COMPLETING OUR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. BARTER REVENUE IS RECORDED ON A GROSS BASIS UNLESS AN AGENCY REPRESENTS THE PROGRAMMER, IN WHICH CASE, REVENUE IS REPORTED NET OF THE COMMISSION RETAINED BY THE AGENCY.  BROADCAST LICENSES, GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS  APPROXIMATELY 63% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 CONSISTED OF INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDING BROADCAST LICENSES, GOODWILL AND MASTHEADS. THESE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ORIGINATED FROM ACQUISITIONS IN WHICH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT  61  OF THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO BROADCAST  LICENSES AND  GOODWILL.  WE DO NOT AM  ORTIZE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE  ASSETS, BUT RATHER TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT AN ASSET MAY BE  IMPAIRED.  WE PERFORM OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, WHICH  COINCIDES WITH OUR BUDGET AND PLANNING PROCESS FOR  THE UPCOMING YEAR.  IMPAIRMENT TESTING REQUIRES AN ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AS THE VALUE IS SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO OUR TOTAL ASSETS AND THE ESTIMATES INCORPORATE VARIABLES AND ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCES AND JUDGMENT ABOUT OUR FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT REFLECT OUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE ESTIMATES THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT RISK. IF ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES USED IN OUR ESTIMATES, WE ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL. THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE DEFINED IN FASB ASC TOPIC 820,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES  AS LEVEL 3 INPUTS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 15 OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.  THE FIRST STEP OF OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT AS TO WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IS IMPAIRED. THIS QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT WHEN CONSIDERING THE EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY AFFECT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THESE EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NOT ALL-INCLUSIVE AND ARE NOT BY THEMSELVES INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT. WE CONSIDER EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL FACTORS WHEN REVIEWING THE FOLLOWING EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH ARE PRESENTED IN THE ORDER OF WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE STRONGEST TO WEAKEST INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT.  (1)  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANY RECENT FAIR VALUE CALCULATIONS AND THE CARRYING VALUE;  (2)  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS STATION OPERATING INCOME, INCLUDING PERFORMANCE AS COMPARED TO PROJECTED RESULTS USED IN PRIOR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE;  (3)  MACROECONOMIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON ACCESSING CAPITAL THAT COULD AFFECT THE DISCOUNT RATES USED IN PRIOR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE;  (4)  INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS A DECLINE IN MARKET-DEPENDENT MULTIPLES OR METRICS, A CHANGE IN DEMAND, COMPETITION, OR OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS;  (5)  OPERATING COST FACTORS, SUCH AS INCREASES IN LABOR, THAT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON FUTURE EXPECTED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS;  (6)  LEGAL, REGULATORY, CONTRACTUAL, POLITICAL, BUSINESS, OR OTHER FACTORS;  (7)  OTHER RELEVANT ENTITY-SPECIFIC EVENTS SUCH AS CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT OR CUSTOMERS; AND  (8)  ANY CHANGES TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET.  IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM A SECOND STEP TO PREPARING A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR OR ENTERPRISE VALUE OF THE ASSETS. WE DID NOT FIND RECONCILIATION TO OUR CURRENT MARKET CAPITALIZATION MEANINGFUL IN THE DETERMINATION OF OUR ENTERPRISE VALUE GIVEN CURRENT FACTORS THAT IMPACT OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: LIMITED TRADING VOLUME, THE IMPACT OF OUR PUBLISHING SEGMENT OPERATING LOSSES AND THE SIGNIFICANT VOTING CONTROL OF OUR CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. WE ENGAGE AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY APPRAISAL AND VALUATION FIRM TO ASSIST US WITH DETERMINING THE ENTERPRISE VALUE AS PART OF OUR QUANTITATIVE REVIEW.  IF THE RESULTS OF OUR QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT IS RECORDED EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE MADE REASONABLE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO CALCULATE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, HOWEVER, THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL IN NATURE. ACTUAL RESULTS CAN BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. IF ACTUAL MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN THOSE PROJECTED BY THE INDUSTRY OR BY US, OR IF EVENTS OCCUR OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD REDUCE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BELOW THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, WE MAY RECOGNIZE FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL.  BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS  WE ACCOUNT FOR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AS SPECIFIED IN FASB ASC TOPIC 805  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  . THE TOTAL ACQUISITION CONSIDERATION IS ALLOCATED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BASED ON THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AS OF THE DATE OF THE TRANSACTION. ESTIMATES OF THE FAIR VALUE INCLUDE DISCOUNTED ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSETS AND THEIR EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MARKET TRENDS AND ANY SYNERGIES BELIEVED TO BE ACHIEVED FROM THE ACQUISITION. THE EXCESS OF CONSIDERATION PAID OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL AND ANY EXCESS OF FAIR VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED OVER THE CONSIDERATION PAID IS RECORDED AS A GAIN ON BARGAIN PURCHASE. PRIOR TO RECORDING A GAIN, THE ACQUIRING ENTITY MUST REASSESS WHETHER ALL ACQUIRED ASSETS AND ASSUMED LIABILITIES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND RECOGNIZED AND PERFORM RE-MEASUREMENTS TO VERIFY THAT THE CONSIDERATION PAID, ASSETS ACQUIRED, AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED HAVE BEEN PROPERLY VALUED.  ACQUISITIONS MAY INCLUDE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION, THE FAIR VALUE OF WHICH IS ESTIMATED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED CONTINGENT PAYMENTS AS DETERMINED USING WEIGHTED PROBABILITIES OF THE PAYMENT AMOUNTS.  A MAJORITY OF OUR RADIO STATION ACQUISITIONS HAVE CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF THE FCC LICENSES TO BROADCAST IN A PARTICULAR MARKET. WE OFTEN DO NOT ACQUIRE THE EXISTING FORMAT, OR WE CHANGE THE FORMAT UPON ACQUISITION WHEN WE FIND IT BENEFICIAL. AS A RESULT, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE ASSETS OF A RADIO STATION IS ALLOCATED TO THE BROADCAST LICENSE. UNDER ASU 2017-01, THAT WAS EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2018, A FEWER NUMBER OF OUR RADIO STATION ACQUISITIONS QUALIFY AS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND INSTEAD  62  ARE  ACC  OUNTED FOR AS ASSET PURCHASES.  ASSET PURCHASES A  RE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THEIR COST TO  ACQUIRE,  INCLUD  ING  TRANSACTION COSTS.  THE COST TO ACQUIRE AN ASSET GROUP IS ALLOCATED TO THE INDIVIDUAL ASSETS ACQUIRED BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE FAIR VALU  E WITH NO GOODWILL RECOGNIZED.  WE MAY RETAIN A THIRD-PARTY APPRAISER TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED NET ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. AS PART OF THE VALUATION AND APPRAISAL PROCESS, THE THIRD-PARTY APPRAISER PREPARES A REPORT ASSIGNING ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES TO THE VARIOUS ASSET CATEGORIES IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECTIVE IN NATURE AND REQUIRE CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND JUDGMENT. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THE THIRD-PARTY REPORTS FOR REASONABLENESS OF THE ASSIGNED VALUES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS REPRESENT THE APPROPRIATE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND WE HAVE NOT HAD TO MODIFY OUR PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS.  WE ESTIMATE THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF EACH TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSET ACQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE PERIOD OF TIME IN WHICH THE ASSET SHOULD BE DEPRECIATED OR AMORTIZED. A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF EACH ASSET. WE CONSIDER OUR OWN EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR ASSETS, INDUSTRY TRENDS, MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE AGE OF THE PROPERTY AT THE TIME OF OUR ACQUISITION TO ESTIMATE THE ECONOMIC LIFE OF EACH ASSET. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ASSETS WERE TO DETERIORATE, THE RESULTING CHANGE IN LIFE OR IMPAIRMENT OF THE ASSET COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL IMPACT AND VOLATILITY IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC LIFE ESTABLISHED FOR EACH MAJOR CATEGORY OF OUR ASSETS.  CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION  OUR ACQUISITIONS OFTEN INCLUDE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION AS PART OF THE PURCHASE PRICE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION IS ESTIMATED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT PAYMENTS EXPECTED TO BE MADE USING A WEIGHTED PROBABILITY OF POSSIBLE PAYMENTS. THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION INCLUDE OUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF PAYMENT BASED ON THE ESTABLISHED BENCHMARKS AND DISCOUNT RATES  BASED ON OUR INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN ANALYSIS.  THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS INCLUDE INPUTS THAT ARE LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENT AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 15 IN THE NOTES OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN PART 1 IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  WE REVIEW THE PROBABILITIES OF POSSIBLE FUTURE PAYMENTS TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ANY CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OVER THE EARN-OUT PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS ARE COMPARED TO THE ESTIMATES AND PROBABILITIES OF ACHIEVEMENT USED IN OUR FORECASTS. SHOULD ACTUAL RESULTS INCREASE OR DECREASE AS COMPARED TO THE ASSUMPTION USED IN OUR ANALYSIS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION OBLIGATIONS WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE, UP TO THE CONTRACTED LIMIT, AS APPLICABLE. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION COULD CAUSE A MATERIAL IMPACT AND VOLATILITY IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  DURING THE PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE RECORDED A NET DECREASE OF $40,000 IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION THAT IS REFLECTED IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THIS PERIOD.  THE CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES REFLECT VOLATILITY FROM VARIABLES, SUCH AS REVENUE GROWTH, PAGE VIEWS AND SESSION TIME AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4 \u2013 CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN PART 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE USED REASONABLE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO CALCULATE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ALL REMAINING CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION HOWEVER, THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE HIGHLY JUDGMENTAL IN NATURE. ACTUAL RESULTS CAN BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  FASB ASC TOPIC 820,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES  ESTABLISHED A SINGLE DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE IN GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE PROVISION APPLIES TO OTHER ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT REQUIRE OR PERMIT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THIS INCLUDES APPLYING THE FAIR VALUE CONCEPT TO (I) NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS; (II) REPORTING UNITS OR NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN CONJUNCTION WITH GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING; (III) OTHER NONFINANCIAL ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN CONJUNCTION WITH IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS; AND (IV) ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE.  THE FAIR VALUE PROVISIONS INCLUDE GUIDANCE ON HOW TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND REEMPHASIZE THAT THE OBJECTIVE OF A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT REMAINS AN EXIT PRICE. IF WE WERE TO CONCLUDE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE VOLUME AND LEVEL OF ACTIVITY OF THE ASSET OR LIABILITY IN RELATION TO NORMAL MARKET ACTIVITIES, QUOTED MARKET VALUES MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF FAIR VALUE AND WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT A CHANGE IN VALUATION TECHNIQUE OR THE USE OF MULTIPLE VALUATION TECHNIQUES MAY BE APPROPRIATE.  THE DEGREE OF JUDGMENT UTILIZED IN MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS GENERALLY CORRELATES TO THE LEVEL OF PRICING OBSERVABILITY. PRICING OBSERVABILITY IS AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE TYPE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT, WHETHER THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS NEW TO THE MARKET, AND THE CHARACTERISTICS SPECIFIC TO THE TRANSACTION. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH READILY AVAILABLE ACTIVE QUOTED PRICES OR FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE CAN BE MEASURED FROM ACTIVELY QUOTED PRICES GENERALLY WILL HAVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF PRICING OBSERVABILITY AND A LESSER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT UTILIZED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE. CONVERSELY, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RARELY TRADED OR NOT QUOTED WILL GENERALLY HAVE LESS (OR NO) PRICING OBSERVABILITY AND A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT UTILIZED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE.  63  FASB  ASC  TOPIC 820 ES  TABLISHED A HIERARCHAL DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEVEL OF PRICING OBSERVABILITY UTILIZED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE. THIS FRAMEWORK DEFINED THREE LEVELS OF INPUTS TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT PROCESS AND REQUIRES THAT EACH FAIR VALUE MEASUREME  NT BE ASSIGNED TO A LEVEL CORRESPONDING TO THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY. THE THREE BROAD LEVELS OF INPUTS DEFINED BY THE FASB ASC TOPIC 820 HIERARCHY ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  LEVEL 1 INPUTS\u2014QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES THAT THE REPORTING ENTITY HAS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE;  \u2022  LEVEL 2 INPUTS\u2014INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES INCLUDED WITHIN LEVEL 1 THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. IF THE ASSET OR LIABILITY HAS A SPECIFIED (CONTRACTUAL) TERM, A LEVEL 2 INPUT MUST BE OBSERVABLE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSET OR LIABILITY; AND  \u2022  LEVEL 3 INPUTS\u2014UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. THESE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS REFLECT THE ENTITY\u2019S OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY AND ARE DEVELOPED BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES (WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE THE REPORTING ENTITY\u2019S OWN DATA).  WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE USED REASONABLE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO CALCULATE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 15 IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN PART 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  CONTINGENCY RESERVES  IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ARE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, LAWSUITS, ARBITRATION AND OTHER CLAIMS THAT ARE COMPLEX IN NATURE AND HAVE OUTCOMES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. CONSEQUENTLY, WE ARE UNABLE TO ASCERTAIN THE ULTIMATE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF MONETARY LIABILITY OR THE FINANCIAL IMPACT WITH RESPECT TO THESE MATTERS. CERTAIN OF THESE PROCEEDINGS ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 17, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES, CONTAINED IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE RECORD CONTINGENCY RESERVES TO THE EXTENT WE CONCLUDE THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE RELATED LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RESERVE IS BASED ON A REVIEW OF ALL RELEVANT FACTORS, THE ADVICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT OF MANAGEMENT. THE RESERVES WE HAVE RECORDED TO DATE HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.  WE BELIEVE THAT  OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE AND THAT OUR RESERVES ARE ACCURATELY REFLECTED.  WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF ANY KNOWN MATERS, INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS, IT IS P  OSSIBLE THAT WE COULD INCUR ADDITIONAL LOSSES.  WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE THAT MAY PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR SUCH MATTERS. FUTURE CLAIMS AGAINST US, WHETHER MERITORIOUS OR NOT, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS, INCLUDING LOSSES DUE TO  COSTLY LITIGATION AND LOSSES DUE TO MATTERS THAT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MANAGEMENT TIME THAT CAN RESULT IN THE DIVERSION OF SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL RESOURCES.  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS  WE EVALUATE THE BALANCE RESERVED IN OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, THE AGE OF THE RECEIVABLES, SPECIFIC CUSTOMER INFORMATION AND CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. PAST DUE BALANCES ARE GENERALLY NOT WRITTEN-OFF UNTIL ALL COLLECTION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL, INCLUDING USE OF A COLLECTIONS AGENCY. A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF THESE RECEIVABLES, INCLUDING THE CURRENT CREDITWORTHINESS OF EACH CUSTOMER. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WERE TO DETERIORATE, RESULTING IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES MAY BE REQUIRED. WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED OUR ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY AND WE HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY RECOGNIZED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE AND THAT OUR RESERVES ARE ACCURATELY REFLECTED.  SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES  WE PROVIDE FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS FOR PRODUCTS SOLD WITH THE RIGHT OF RETURN, PRIMARILY BOOK SALES ASSOCIATED WITH REGNERY  \u00ae  PUBLISHING AND NUTRITIONAL PRODUCTS SOLD THROUGH OUR WELLNESS DIVISION. WE RECORD AN ESTIMATE OF THESE PRODUCT RETURNS AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE IN THE PERIOD OF THE SALE. OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL SALES RETURNS, THE AMOUNT OF CURRENT PERIOD SALES, ECONOMIC TRENDS AND ANY CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEMAND AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR ACTUAL PERFORMANCE TO ESTIMATED RETURN RATES AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY. ESTIMATED RETURN RATES UTILIZED FOR ESTABLISHING ESTIMATED RETURNS RESERVES HAVE APPROXIMATED ACTUAL RETURNS EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER, ACTUAL RETURNS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY, EITHER FAVORABLY OR UNFAVORABLY, FROM THESE ESTIMATES IF FACTORS SUCH AS THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USED TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS OR AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THE CUSTOMER AND/OR THE MARKET.  WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED OUR ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY AND WE HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY RECOGNIZED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE AND THAT OUR RESERVES ARE ACCURATELY REFLECTED.  64  INVENTORY  R  ESERVES  INVENTORIES CONSIST OF FINISHED GOODS, INCLUDING PUBLISHED BOOKS AND WELLNESS PRODUCTS. INVENTORY IS RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE AS DETERMINED ON A FIRST-IN FIRST-OUT COST METHOD. WE REVIEWED HISTORICAL DATA ASSOCIATED WITH BOOK AND WELLNESS PRODUCT INVENTORIES HELD BY REGNERY  \u00ae  PUBLISHING AND OUR E-COMMERCE WELLNESS ENTITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN EXPERIENCES TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF INVENTORY ON HAND. OUR ANALYSIS INCLUDES A REVIEW OF ACTUAL SALES RETURNS, OUR ALLOWANCES, ROYALTY RESERVES, OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT DEMAND. WE RECORD A PROVISION TO EXPENSE THE BALANCE OF UNSOLD INVENTORY THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE UNRECOVERABLE. WE REGULARLY MONITOR ACTUAL PERFORMANCE TO OUR ESTIMATES AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY. ESTIMATED INVENTORY RESERVES MAY BE ADJUSTED, EITHER FAVORABLY OR UNFAVORABLY, IF FACTORS SUCH AS THE HISTORICAL DATA WE USED TO CALCULATE THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT PROPERLY REFLECT FUTURE RETURNS OR AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THE CUSTOMER AND/OR THE MARKET.  WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED OUR ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY AND WE HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY RECOGNIZED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE AND THAT OUR RESERVES ARE ACCURATELY REFLECTED.  RESERVES FOR ROYALTY ADVANCES  ROYALTIES DUE TO BOOK AUTHORS ARE PAID IN ADVANCE AND CAPITALIZED. ROYALTIES ARE EXPENSED AS THE RELATED BOOK REVENUES ARE EARNED OR WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT FUTURE RECOVERY OF THE ROYALTY IS NOT LIKELY. WE REVIEWED HISTORICAL DATA ASSOCIATED WITH ROYALTY ADVANCES, EARNINGS AND RECOVERABILITY BASED ON ACTUAL RESULTS OF REGNERY  \u00ae  PUBLISHING. HISTORICALLY, THE LONGER THE UNEARNED PORTION OF AN ADVANCE REMAINS OUTSTANDING, THE LESS LIKELY IT IS THAT WE WILL RECOVER THE ADVANCE THROUGH THE SALE OF THE BOOK. WE APPLY THIS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE TO OUTSTANDING ROYALTY ADVANCES TO ESTIMATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF RECOVERY. A PROVISION WAS ESTABLISHED TO EXPENSE THE BALANCE OF ANY UNEARNED ADVANCE WHICH WE BELIEVE IS NOT RECOVERABLE. OUR ANALYSIS ALSO CONSIDERS OTHER DISCRETE FACTORS, SUCH AS DEATH OF AN AUTHOR, ANY DECISION TO NOT PURSUE PUBLICATION OF A TITLE, POOR MARKET DEMAND OR OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS.  WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED OUR ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY AND WE HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY RECOGNIZED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE AND THAT OUR RESERVES ARE ACCURATELY REFLECTED.  FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY AWARDS  WE ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF FASB ASC TOPIC 718,  COMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION  . WE RECORD EQUITY AWARDS WITH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION MEASURED AT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AS OF THE GRANT DATE. WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH AWARD USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES VALUATION MODEL THAT REQUIRES THE INPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THE EXPECTED STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED TERM OF THE AWARD GRANTED. THE EXERCISE PRICE FOR EACH AWARD IS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE CLOSING MARKET PRICE OF SALEM MEDIA GROUP, INC. COMMON STOCK AS OF THE DATE OF THE AWARD. WE USE THE STRAIGHT-LINE ATTRIBUTION METHOD TO RECOGNIZE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS OVER THE EXPECTED SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD. UPON EXERCISE, CANCELLATION, FORFEITURE, OR EXPIRATION OF THE AWARD, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR AWARDS WITH MULTIPLE VESTING DATES ARE ELIMINATED FOR EACH VESTING PERIOD ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS AS IF EACH VESTING PERIOD WAS A SEPARATE AWARD. WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED OUR ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS USED IN OUR VALUATION MODEL. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE AND THAT OUR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION IS ACCURATELY REFLECTED IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  PARTIAL SELF-INSURANCE ON EMPLOYEE HEALTH PLAN  WE PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES UNDER A SELF-INSURED PLAN WHEREBY WE PAY ACTUAL MEDICAL CLAIMS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN STOP LOSS LIMITS. WE RECORD SELF-INSURANCE LIABILITIES BASED ON ACTUAL CLAIMS FILED AND AN ESTIMATE OF THOSE CLAIMS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED. OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA AND PROBABILITIES. ANY PROJECTION OF LOSSES CONCERNING OUR LIABILITY IS SUBJECT TO A HIGH DEGREE OF VARIABILITY. AMONG THE CAUSES OF THIS VARIABILITY ARE UNPREDICTABLE EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS FUTURE INFLATION RATES, CHANGES IN SEVERITY, BENEFIT LEVEL CHANGES, MEDICAL COSTS AND CLAIM SETTLEMENT PATTERNS. SHOULD THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF CLAIMS INCREASE OR DECREASE BEYOND WHAT WAS ANTICIPATED, WE MAY ADJUST OUR FUTURE RESERVES. OUR SELF-INSURANCE LIABILITY WAS $0.7 MILLION AND $0.8 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED OUR ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY AND WE HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY RECOGNIZED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES.  LEASES  WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 842,  LEASES  (\u201cASC 842\u201d) ISSUED UNDER ASU 2016-02 ON JANUARY 1, 2019. UNDER ASC 842, WE CONSIDER ALL RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, TO DETERMINE  WHETHER A CONTRACT IS OR CONTAINS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. OUR ANALYSIS INCLUDES  WHETHER THE CONTRACT CONVEYS THE RIGHT TO CONTROL THE USE OF AN IDENTIFIED ASSET FOR A PERIOD OF TIME IN EXCHANGE FOR CONSIDERATION. THIS CONSIDERATION INVOLVES JUDGMENT WITH RESPECT TO WHETHER WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM THE USE OF THE IDENTIFIED ASSET AND WHETHER WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DIRECT THE USE OF THE IDENTIFIED ASSET.  LEASE TERM \u2013 IMPACT ON RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES  THE LEASE TERM CAN MATERIALLY IMPACT THE VALUE OF THE RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES RECORDED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AS REQUIRED UNDER ASC 842. WE CALCULATE THE TERM FOR EACH LEASE AGREEMENT TO INCLUDE THE NONCANCELLABLE PERIOD SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT TOGETHER WITH (1) THE PERIODS COVERED BY OPTIONS TO EXTEND THE LEASE IF WE ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE THAT OPTION, (2) PERIODS COVERED BY AN OPTION TO TERMINATE IF WE ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN NOT TO EXERCISE THAT OPTION AND (3) PERIOD COVERED BY AN OPTION TO EXTEND (OR NOT TERMINATE) IF CONTROLLED BY THE LESSOR. THE ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER WE ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE AN OPTION TO EXTEND A LEASE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENT SURROUNDING CONTRACT-BASED FACTORS, ASSET-BASED FACTORS, ENTITY-BASED FACTORS AND MARKET-BASED FACTORS. THESE FACTORS, DETAILED BELOW, ARE EVALUATED BASED ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE TIME WE ENTER A LEASE AGREEMENT.  65  CONTRACT-BASED FACTORS.  \u2022  THE EXISTENCE OF A BARGAIN RENEWAL OPTION  \u2022  THE EXISTENCE OF CONTINGENT OR VARIABLE PAYMENTS  \u2022  THE NATURE AND TERMS OF RENEWAL OR TERMINATION OPTIONS  \u2022  THE COSTS THE LESSEE WOULD INCUR TO RESTORE THE ASSET BEFORE RETURNING IT TO THE LESSOR  ASSET-BASED FACTORS.  \u2022  THE EXISTENCE OF SIGNIFICANT LESSEE-INSTALLED LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS THAT WOULD STILL HAVE ECONOMIC VALUE WHEN THE OPTION BECOMES EXERCISABLE  \u2022  THE PHYSICAL LOCATION OF THE ASSET  \u2022  THE COSTS THAT WOULD BE INCURRED TO REPLACE OR FIND AN ALTERNATIVE ASSET  ENTITY-BASED FACTORS.  \u2022  HISTORICAL PRACTICE  \u2022  MANAGEMENT\u2019S INTENT  \u2022  COMMON INDUSTRY PRACTICE  \u2022  THE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE ENTITY OF EXTENDING OR TERMINATING THE LEASE  \u2022  THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LEASED ASSET TO THE ENTITY\u2019S OPERATIONS  MARKET-BASED FACTORS.  \u2022  MARKET RENTAL OR PURCHASE RATES FOR COMPARABLE ASSETS  \u2022  POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS OF LOCAL REGULATIONS AND STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS  WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED OUR ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY SINCE ADOPTING ASC 842 ON JANUARY 1, 2019.  INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE  THE ROU ASSET AND RELATED LEASE LIABILITIES RECORDED UNDER ASC 842 ARE CALCULATED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE LEASE PAYMENTS USING (1) THE RATE IMPLICIT IN THE LEASE OR (2) THE LESSEE\u2019S INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE (\u201cIBR\u201d). IBR IS DEFINED AS THE RATE OF INTEREST THAT A LESSEE WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO BORROW ON A COLLATERALIZED BASIS OVER A SIMILAR TERM AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LEASE PAYMENTS IN A SIMILAR ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.  WE PERFORMED AN ANALYSIS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019 TO ESTIMATE THE IBR APPLICABLE TO SALEM UPON TRANSITION TO ASC 842. OUR ANALYSIS REQUIRED THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENT AND ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LEASED ASSET, AND THE FOLLOWING AVAILABLE EVIDENCE.  THE CREDIT HISTORY OF SALEM MEDIA GROUP  OUR MOST RECENT CREDIT FACILITY CONSISTED OF 6.75% SENIOR SECURED NOTES AND AN ABL REVOLVER. AS OF EACH MONTH END, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON OUTSTANDING DEBT WAS CALCULATED. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON THE OUTSTANDING DEBT RANGED FROM A LOW OF 2.97% FOR THE ABL TO A HIGH OF 6.75% FOR THE NOTES. ON A COMBINED BASIS, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE FOR THE ABL AND THE NOTES RANGED FROM 99 TO 257 BASIS POINTS ABOVE PRIME.  BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND PREVAILING INTEREST RATES IN 2018 THAT WERE HIGHER THAN OUR NOTES, WE COMPLETED VARIOUS OPEN-MARKET REPURCHASES OF THE NOTES AT PRICES BELOW FACE VALUE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE NOTES WERE TRADING AT 91.5% OF THE FACE VALUE.  THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF SALEM MEDIA GROUP  AT JANUARY 1, 2019, OUR MOODY\u2019S RATING WAS \u201cB2,\u201d CONSISTENT WITH THE LAST TEN YEARS. A B2 CREDIT RATING IS CONSIDERED SPECULATIVE IN NATURE AND SUBJECT TO HIGH CREDIT RISK.  CLASS OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET AND THE REMAINING TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENT  WE ELECTED TO USE A PORTFOLIO APPROACH APPLYING A SINGLE IBR TO LEASES WITH REASONABLY SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING THE REMAINING LEASE TERM, THE UNDERLYING ASSETS AND THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. AS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION, WE GROUPED EACH LEASE ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF LEASED ASSET AND FURTHER GROUPED THE ITEMS BY THE REMAINING LEASE TERM AS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION. WE HAVE SIX MAIN CATEGORIES OF LEASES, (1) BUILDINGS, (2) EQUIPMENT, (3) LAND, (4) OTHER (PARKING FACILITIES), (5) TOWERS AND (6) VEHICLES.  WE CONSIDERED VEHICLES TO HAVE A HIGHER RISK FOR COLLATERAL THAT IS MITIGATED BY THE SHORTER TERM OF THE LEASE THAT WOULD TYPICALLY RANGE FROM THREE TO FIVE YEARS. WE CONSIDERED BUILDING AND TOWERS TO HAVE A HIGHER RISK BASED ON (1) THE LONGER LEASE TERM OF UP TO THIRTY YEARS AND (2) A HIGHER OUTSTANDING BALANCE THAT IS MITIGATED BY THE LOWER RISK THAT THE COLLATERALIZED ASSET WOULD LOSE SIGNIFICANT VALUE.  66  THE DEBT INCURRED UNDER THE LEASE LIABILITY AS COMPARED  TO AMOUNTS THAT WOULD BE BORROWED  WE REVIEWED THE COST TO FINANCE COMPARABLE AMOUNTS UNDER OUR ABL AND BASED ON THE CURRENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT AS DERIVED FROM AVAILABLE ECONOMIC DATA.  WE REFERRED TO THE BLOOMBERG SINGLE B RATED COMMUNICATIONS YIELD CURVE (UNSECURED) AND CONSIDERED ADJUSTMENTS FOR INDUSTRY RISK FACTORS AND THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING LEASED ASSET TO BE COLLATERAL FOR THE DEBT INCURRED.  FROM THIS ANALYSIS, WE DEVELOPED A MATRIX TO ESTIMATE THE IBR FOR EACH MAJOR CATEGORY OF LEASES. WE WILL REVIEW OUR IBR ESTIMATES ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND UPDATE AS NECESSARY. WE HAVE NOT MODIFIED OUR ESTIMATE METHODOLOGY SINCE ADOPTING ASC 842 ON JANUARY 1, 2019.  INCOME TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES (DEFERRED TAXES)  IN PREPARING OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ESTIMATE OUR INCOME TAX LIABILITY IN EACH OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE BY ESTIMATING OUR ACTUAL CURRENT TAX EXPOSURE AND ASSESSING TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULTING FROM DIFFERING TREATMENT OF ITEMS FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES. OUR JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX CONSIDER CURRENT TAX LAWS, OUR INTERPRETATION OF CURRENT TAX LAWS AND POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF AUDITS CONDUCTED BY TAX AUTHORITIES. RESERVES FOR INCOME TAXES TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL EXPOSURES INVOLVING TAX POSITIONS THAT COULD BE CHALLENGED BY TAX AUTHORITIES ARE ESTABLISHED IF NECESSARY. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR OUR INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAWS AND THE RESOLUTION OF ANY FUTURE TAX AUDITS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE AMOUNTS PROVIDED FOR INCOME TAXES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE CALCULATE OUR CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAX PROVISIONS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT COULD DIFFER FROM THE ACTUAL RESULTS REFLECTED IN INCOME TAX RETURNS FILED DURING THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR. ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON FILED RETURNS ARE GENERALLY RECORDED IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE TAX RETURNS ARE FILED AND THE TAX IMPLICATIONS ARE KNOWN. TAX LAW AND RATE CHANGES ARE REFLECTED IN THE INCOME TAX PROVISION IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES ARE ENACTED.  WE RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, INCLUDING HISTORICAL LEVELS OF INCOME, EXPECTATIONS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ESTIMATES OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND ONGOING PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES IN ASSESSING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO DETERMINE THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REALIZE ALL OR PART OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN THE FUTURE, AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MAKE SUCH A DETERMINATION. LIKEWISE, IF WE LATER DETERMINE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD BE REALIZED, WE WOULD REVERSE THE APPLICABLE PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  AS A RESULT OF OUR ADJUSTED CUMULATIVE THREE-YEAR PRE-TAX BOOK LOSS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE PERFORMED A REVIEW OF OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE. WE RECORDED AN INCREASE TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $5.4 MILLION, FOR A TOTAL VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $10.8 MILLION.  INCOME TAXES AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS  WE ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT AND REVIEW BY VARIOUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. WE MAY RECOGNIZE LIABILITIES ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR POSITIONS TAKEN ON UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. WHEN TAX RETURNS ARE FILED, IT IS HIGHLY CERTAIN THAT SOME POSITIONS TAKEN WOULD BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, WHILE OTHERS MAY BE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE MERITS OF THE POSITION TAKEN OR THE AMOUNT OF THE POSITION THAT WOULD BE ULTIMATELY SUSTAINED. SUCH POSITIONS ARE DEEMED TO BE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY IS ESTABLISHED ON THE BALANCE SHEET.  IT IS INHERENTLY DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE TO ESTIMATE SUCH AMOUNTS, AS THIS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES BASED ON THE VARIOUS POSSIBLE OUTCOMES.  THE BENEFIT OF A TAX POSITION IS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH, BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, WE BELIEVE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION, INCLUDING THE RESOLUTION OF APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, IF ANY.  WE REVIEW AND REEVALUATE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS MAY RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF A TAX BENEFIT OR AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO THE TAX PROVISION. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE NO LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS RECORDED AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. OUR EVALUATION WAS PERFORMED FOR ALL TAX YEARS THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION, WHICH RANGE FROM 2014 THROUGH 2017. THERE IS CURRENTLY ONE TAX EXAMINATION IN PROCESS. IN AUGUST 10, 2017, THE CITY OF NEW YORK BEGAN ITS AUDIT OF SALEM\u2019S 2013 AND 2014 TAX FILINGS. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL OR SIGNIFICANT RESULTS FROM THE AUDIT.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF FUNDS ARE OPERATING CASH FLOWS, BORROWINGS UNDER CREDIT FACILITIES AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SELECTED ASSETS OR BUSINESSES. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY FUNDED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO FUND, EXPENDITURES FOR OPERATIONS, ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FROM THESE SOURCES. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY FINANCED ACQUISITIONS THROUGH BORROWINGS, INCLUDING BORROWINGS UNDER CREDIT FACILITIES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, FROM OPERATING CASH FLOW AND FROM PROCEEDS ON SELECTED ASSET DISPOSITIONS. WE EXPECT TO FUND FUTURE ACQUISITIONS FROM CASH ON HAND, BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, OPERATING CASH FLOW AND POSSIBLY THROUGH THE SALE OF INCOME-PRODUCING ASSETS OR PROCEEDS FROM DEBT AND EQUITY OFFERINGS. WE HAVE ASSESSED THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND OUR CURRENT AND EXPECTED NEEDS FOR FUNDS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CURRENT CREDIT FACILITIES ALLOWS US  67  TO MEET OUR ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS, FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AN  D SATISFY OUR DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, INCLUDING OUR WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AT  SEPTEMBER 30  ,  2019.  GENERALLY, WE KEEP THE BALANCE OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS LOW IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE BALANCE OF OUTSTANDING DEBT. OUR ABL FACILITY AUTOMATICALLY COVERS ANY SHORTFALLS IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS SUCH THAT WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HOLD EXCESS CASH BALANCES ON HAND. OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED TO $7,000 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $0.1 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED $4.8 MILLION TO $(4.4 MILLION) AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO ($9.2 MILLION) AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 DUE TO THE RECOGNITION OF ROU ASSETS OF $9.5 MILLION, THE DERECOGNITION OF PREPAID RENT OF $1.1 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES OF $3.6 MILLION AND A $1.6 MILLION DECREASE IN THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON THE ABL.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS  OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF OPERATING CASH INFLOWS ARE RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS IN EXCHANGE FOR ADVERTISING AND PROGRAMMING. OTHER SOURCES OF OPERATING CASH INFLOWS INCLUDE RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS FOR DIGITAL DOWNLOADS AND STREAMING, BOOK SALES, SUBSCRIPTIONS, SELF-PUBLISHING FEES, TICKET SALES, SPONSORSHIPS, AND VENDOR PROMOTIONS. A MAJORITY OF OUR OPERATING CASH OUTFLOWS CONSIST OF PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, SUCH AS SALARIES AND BENEFITS, AND VENDOR PAYMENTS UNDER FACILITY AND TOWER LEASES, TALENT AGREEMENTS, INVENTORY PURCHASES AND RECURRING SERVICES SUCH AS UTILITIES AND MUSIC LICENSE FEES. OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS ARE  SUBJECT TO FACTORS SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN PREFERRED ADVERTISING MEDIA AND CHANGES IN DEMAND CAUSED  BY SHIFTS IN POPULATION, STATION LISTENERSHIP, DEMOGRAPHICS, AND AUDIENCE TASTES. IN ADDITION, OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS MAY BE AFFECTED IF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE UNABLE TO PAY, DELAY PAYMENT OF AMOUNTS OWED TO US, OR IF WE EXPERIENCE REDUCTIONS IN REVENUE, OR INCREASES IN COSTS AND EXPENSES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 DECREASED BY $5.7 MILLION TO $14.5 MILLION COMPARED TO $20.2 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVED TO A $4.4 MILLION DEFICIT FROM A $9.2 MILLION DEFICIT DUE TO THE $7.8 MILLION SHORT-TERM RECEIVABLE FROM STATION SALES THAT CLOSED ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2019. THE DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS.  \u2022  TOTAL NET REVENUE DECLINED BY $6.3 MILLION,  \u2022  OPERATING EXPENSES EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION, IMPAIRMENTS AND NET GAIN (LOSS) ON THE DISPOSITION OF ASSETS, DECREASED BY $0.2 MILLION;  \u2022  TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES, NET OF ALLOWANCES, INCREASED BY $0.4 MILLION COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF $2.5 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO A CHANGE IN OUR REGNERY PUBLISHING DISTRIBUTOR ARRANGEMENT UNDER WHICH THERE IS A SIX MONTH HOLD BACK ON PAYMENT PENDING THE PROCESSING OF RETURNS;  \u2022  UNBILLED REVENUE DECREASED $0.2 MILLION;  \u2022  OUR DAY\u2019S SALES OUTSTANDING, OR THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS TO COLLECT CASH FROM THE DATE OF SALE, DECREASED TO 64 DAYS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 68 DAYS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2018;  \u2022  NET ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES INCREASED $3.6 MILLION TO $23.5 MILLION FROM $25.0 MILLION AS OF THE PRIOR YEAR; AND  \u2022  NET INVENTORIES ON HAND DECREASED $28,000 TO $0.6 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF $0.2 MILLION TO $0.9 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  INVESTING CASH FLOWS  OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF INVESTING CASH INFLOWS INCLUDES PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS OR BUSINESSES. INVESTING CASH OUTFLOWS INCLUDE CASH PAYMENTS MADE TO ACQUIRE BUSINESSES, TO ACQUIRE PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND TO ACQUIRE INTANGIBLE ASSETS SUCH AS DOMAIN NAMES. WHILE OUR FOCUS CONTINUES TO BE ON DELEVERAGING THE COMPANY, WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO EXPLORE AND PURSUE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS.  IN RECENT YEARS, WE ENTERED ACQUISITION AGREEMENTS THAT CONTAIN CONTINGENT EARN-OUT ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE PAYABLE IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PREDEFINED OPERATING RESULTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT ARRANGEMENTS PROVIDE SOME DEGREE OF PROTECTION WITH REGARD TO OUR CASH OUTFLOWS SHOULD THESE ACQUISITIONS NOT MEET OUR OPERATIONAL EXPECTATIONS.  WE UNDERTAKE PROJECTS FROM TIME TO TIME TO UPGRADE OUR RADIO STATION TECHNICAL FACILITIES AND/OR FCC BROADCAST LICENSES, EXPAND OUR DIGITAL AND WEB-BASED OFFERINGS, IMPROVE OUR FACILITIES AND UPGRADE OUR COMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURES. THE NATURE AND TIMING OF THESE UPGRADES AND EXPENDITURES CAN BE DELAYED OR SCALED BACK AT THE DISCRETION OF MANAGEMENT. BASED ON OUR CURRENT PLANS, WE EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.7 MILLION DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  WE PLAN TO FUND FUTURE PURCHASES AND ANY ACQUISITIONS FROM CASH ON HAND, OPERATING CASH FLOW OR OUR CREDIT FACILITIES.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $5.4 MILLION TO $3.9 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 FROM $9.3 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS THE RESULT OF.  \u2022  CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS DECREASED $9.6 MILLION TO $1.3 MILLION COMPARED TO $10.9 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR;  \u2022  CASH PAID FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DECREASED $0.4 MILLION TO $6.1 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 FROM $6.5 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR, AND  \u2022  RECEIPTS FROM ASSET SALES WERE $4.2 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $8.5 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR;  68  FINANCING CASH FLOWS  FINANCING CASH INFLOWS INCLUDE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AND ANY PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED UNDER OUR STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN. FINANCING CASH OUTFLOWS INCLUDE REPAYMENTS OF OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, THE PAYMENT OF EQUITY DISTRIBUTIONS AND PAYMENTS OF AMOUNTS DUE UNDER DEFERRED INSTALLMENTS AND CONTINGENCY EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITION ACTIVITY.  DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE PRINCIPAL BALANCES OUTSTANDING UNDER THE NOTES AND ABL FACILITY RANGED FROM $244.4 MILLION TO $258.2 MILLION. THESE OUTSTANDING BALANCES WERE ORDINARY AND CUSTOMARY BASED ON OUR OPERATING AND INVESTING CASH NEEDS DURING THIS TIME.  ANY FUTURE EQUITY DISTRIBUTIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE COMPARABLE TO PRIOR DECLARATIONS UNLESS THERE ARE CHANGES IN EXPECTED FUTURE EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF CLASS A AND CLASS B COMMON STOCK CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING WE EXPECT TO PAY TOTAL ANNUAL EQUITY DISTRIBUTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $6.9 MILLION IN 2019. HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS AND EQUITY DISTRIBUTIONS, AS WELL AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PER SHARE AMOUNTS, DATES OF RECORD, AND PAYMENT DATES ARE SUBJECT TO FINAL DETERMINATION BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DEPEND UPON FUTURE EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, AND OTHER FACTORS.  OUR SOLE SOURCE OF CASH AVAILABLE FOR MAKING ANY FUTURE EQUITY DISTRIBUTIONS IS OUR OPERATING CASH FLOW, SUBJECT TO OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AND NOTES, WHICH CONTAIN COVENANTS THAT RESTRICT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND EQUITY DISTRIBUTIONS UNLESS CERTAIN SPECIFIED CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $0.2 MILLION TO $10.7 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 FROM $10.9 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCLUDES.  \u2022  A $0.5 MILLION DECREASE IN THE BOOK OVERDRAFT TO $2.3 MILLION FROM $2.8 MILLION OF THE PRIOR YEAR;  \u2022  WE USED $6.1 MILLION OF CASH TO REPURCHASE $6.7 MILLION IN FACE VALUE OF THE 6.75% SENIOR SECURED NOTES COMPARED TO $9.5 MILLION OF CASH TO REPURCHASE $10.0 MILLION THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR; AND  \u2022  NET BORROWINGS ON OUR ABL FACILITY WERE $1.6 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO NET PROCEEDS OF $1.2 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  SALEM MEDIA GROUP, INC. HAS NO INDEPENDENT ASSETS OR OPERATIONS, THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEES RELATING TO CERTAIN DEBT ARE FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL AND JOINT AND SEVERAL, AND ANY SUBSIDIARIES OF SALEM MEDIA GROUP, INC. OTHER THAN THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS ARE MINOR.  6.75% SENIOR SECURED NOTES  ON MAY 19, 2017, WE ISSUED IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT THE NOTES, WHICH ARE GUARANTEED ON A SENIOR SECURED BASIS BY OUR EXISTING SUBSIDIARIES (THE \u201cSUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS\u201d). THE NOTES BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE OF 6.75% PER YEAR AND MATURE ON JUNE 1, 2024, UNLESS THEY ARE EARLIER REDEEMED OR REPURCHASED. INTEREST INITIALLY ACCRUED ON THE NOTES FROM MAY 19, 2017 AND IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY, IN CASH IN ARREARS, ON JUNE 1 AND DECEMBER 1 OF EACH YEAR, COMMENCING DECEMBER 1, 2017.  THE NOTES ARE SECURED BY A FIRST-PRIORITY LIEN ON SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ASSETS OF OURS AND THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS (THE \u201cNOTES PRIORITY COLLATERAL\u201d). THERE IS NO DIRECT LIEN ON OUR FCC LICENSES TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW OR REGULATION.  WE MAY REDEEM THE NOTES, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT ANY TIME ON OR BEFORE JUNE 1, 2020 AT A PRICE EQUAL TO 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES PLUS A \u201cMAKE-WHOLE\u201d PREMIUM AS OF, AND ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, IF ANY, TO, BUT NOT INCLUDING, THE REDEMPTION DATE. AT ANY TIME ON OR AFTER JUNE 1, 2020, WE MAY REDEEM SOME OR ALL OF THE NOTES AT THE REDEMPTION PRICES (EXPRESSED AS PERCENTAGES OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT TO BE REDEEMED) SET FORTH IN THE NOTES, PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, IF ANY, TO, BUT NOT INCLUDING, THE REDEMPTION DATE. IN ADDITION, WE MAY REDEEM UP TO 35% OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES BEFORE JUNE 1, 2020 WITH THE NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM CERTAIN EQUITY OFFERINGS AT A REDEMPTION PRICE OF 106.75% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST, IF ANY, TO, BUT NOT INCLUDING, THE REDEMPTION DATE. WE MAY ALSO REDEEM UP TO 10% OF THE AGGREGATE ORIGINAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES PER TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD BEFORE JUNE 1, 2020 AT A REDEMPTION PRICE OF 103% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST TO, BUT NOT INCLUDING, THE REDEMPTION DATE.  THE INDENTURE RELATING TO THE NOTES (THE \u201cINDENTURE\u201d) CONTAINS COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS AND SUBJECT IN EACH CASE TO CERTAIN SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, LIMIT OUR ABILITY AND THE ABILITY OF OUR RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES TO: (I) INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT; (II) DECLARE OR PAY DIVIDENDS, REDEEM STOCK OR MAKE OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS; (III) MAKE INVESTMENTS; (IV) CREATE LIENS OR USE ASSETS AS SECURITY IN OTHER TRANSACTIONS; (V) MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE, OR SELL, TRANSFER, LEASE OR DISPOSE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS; (VI) ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; AND (VII) SELL OR TRANSFER ASSETS.  THE INDENTURE PROVIDES FOR THE FOLLOWING EVENTS OF DEFAULT (EACH, AN \u201cEVENT OF DEFAULT\u201d): (I) DEFAULT IN PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OR PREMIUM ON THE NOTES AT MATURITY, UPON REPURCHASE, ACCELERATION, OPTIONAL REDEMPTION OR OTHERWISE; (II) DEFAULT FOR 30 DAYS IN PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON THE NOTES; (III) THE FAILURE BY US OR CERTAIN RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES TO COMPLY WITH OTHER AGREEMENTS IN THE INDENTURE OR THE NOTES, IN CERTAIN CASES SUBJECT TO NOTICE AND LAPSE OF TIME; (IV) THE FAILURE OF ANY GUARANTEE BY CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS TO BE IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT AND ENFORCEABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS TERMS, SUBJECT TO NOTICE AND LAPSE OF TIME; (V) CERTAIN ACCELERATIONS (INCLUDING FAILURE TO PAY WITHIN ANY GRACE PERIOD) OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF OURS OR ANY RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARY IF  69  THE AMOUNT ACCELERATED (OR SO UNPAID) IS AT LEAST $15 MILLION; (VI) CERTAIN JUDGMENTS FOR THE PAYM  ENT OF MONEY IN EXCESS OF $15 MILLION; (VII) CERTAIN EVENTS OF BANKRUPTCY OR INSOLVENCY WITH RESPECT TO US OR ANY SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARY; AND (VII) CERTAIN DEFAULTS WITH RESPECT TO ANY COLLATERAL HAVING A FAIR MARKET VALUE IN EXCESS OF $15 MILLION. IF AN E  VENT OF DEFAULT OCCURS AND IS CONTINUING, THE TRUSTEE OR THE HOLDERS OF AT LEAST 25% IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE OUTSTANDING NOTES MAY DECLARE THE PRINCIPAL OF THE NOTES AND ANY ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE NOTES TO BE DUE AND PAYABLE IMMEDIATELY, SUBJECT TO REM  EDY OR CURE IN CERTAIN CASES. CERTAIN EVENTS OF BANKRUPTCY OR INSOLVENCY ARE EVENTS OF DEFAULT WHICH WILL RESULT IN THE NOTES BEING DUE AND PAYABLE IMMEDIATELY UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  BASED ON THE BALANCE OF THE NOTES CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY $15.7 MILLION PER YEAR IN INTEREST ON THE NOTES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE NOTES WAS $5.2 MILLION.  WE INCURRED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS OF $6.3 MILLION THAT WERE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF THE DEBT PROCEEDS THAT ARE BEING AMORTIZED TO NON-CASH INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIFE OF THE NOTES USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, $0.2 MILLION AND $0.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOTES WAS AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, $0.2 MILLION AND $0.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOTES WAS AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE.  WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRICES, CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS, OUR FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND OTHER FACTORS, SEEK TO REPURCHASE THE NOTES IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, BY TENDER OFFER OR OTHERWISE, AS  MARKET CONDITIONS WARRANT.  BASED ON THE THEN EXISTING MARKET CONDITIONS, WE COMPLETED REPURCHASES OF OUR 6.75% SENIOR SECURED NOTES AT AMOUNTS LESS THAN FACE VALUE AS FOLLOWS.

WE USED THE PROCEEDS OF THE ABL FACILITY, TOGETHER WITH THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE NOTES OFFERING, TO REPAY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR PREVIOUSLY EXISTING SENIOR CREDIT FACILITIES, AND RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES. CURRENT PROCEEDS FROM THE ABL FACILITY ARE USED TO PROVIDE ONGOING WORKING CAPITAL AND FOR OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING PERMITTED ACQUISITIONS.  THE ABL FACILITY IS A FIVE-YEAR $30.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DUE MAY 19, 2022, WHICH INCLUDES A $5.0 MILLION SUBFACILITY FOR STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND A $7.5 MILLION SUBFACILITY FOR SWINGLINE LOANS. ALL BORROWINGS UNDER THE ABL FACILITY ACCRUE AT A RATE EQUAL TO A BASE RATE OR LIBOR RATE PLUS A SPREAD. THE SPREAD, WHICH IS BASED ON AN AVAILABILITY-BASED MEASURE, RANGES FROM 0.50% TO 1.00% FOR BASE RATE BORROWINGS AND 1.50% TO 2.00% FOR LIBOR RATE BORROWINGS. IF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT OCCURS, THE INTEREST RATE MAY INCREASE BY 2.00% PER ANNUM. AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE ABL FACILITY MAY BE PAID AND THEN REBORROWED AT OUR D  ISCRETION WITHOUT PENALTY OR PREMIUM. ADDITIONALLY, WE PAY A COMMITMENT FEE ON THE UNUSED BALANCE FROM 0.25% TO 0.375% PER YEAR BASED ON THE LEVEL OF BORROWINGS. THE LIBOR RATE SCHEDULED TO BE DISCONTINUED AT THE END OF CALENDAR YEAR 2021 WOULD RESULT IN ALL OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS SUBJECT TO THE HIGHER BASE RATE BORROWING. WE EXPECT TO AMEND THE ABL PRIOR TO THE LIBOR PHASEOUT BASED ON THE ABL MATURITY DATE OF MAY 19, 2022.  AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL IS SUBJECT TO A BORROWING BASE CONSISTING OF (A) 85% OF THE ELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PLUS (B) A CALCULATED AMOUNT BASED ON THE VALUE OF CERTAIN REAL PROPERTY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER THE ABL WAS $26.2 MILLION OF WHICH $18.1 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING.  THE ABL FACILITY HAS A FIRST-PRIORITY LIEN ON OUR AND THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS\u2019 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY, DEPOSIT AND SECURITIES ACCOUNTS, CERTAIN REAL ESTATE AND RELATED ASSETS (THE \u201cABL PRIORITY  70  COLLATERAL\u201d) AND BY A SECOND-PRIORITY LIEN ON THE NOTES PRIORITY COLLATERAL. THERE  IS NO DIRECT LIEN ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FCC LICENSES TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW OR REGULATION (OTHER THAN THE ECONOMIC VALUE AND PROCEEDS THEREOF).  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES A SPRINGING FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF 1.0 TO 1.0, WHICH IS TESTED DURING THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE LAST DAY OF THE FISCAL MONTH MOST RECENTLY ENDED PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH AVAILABILITY (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) IS LESS THAN THE GREATER OF 15% OF THE MAXIMUM REVOLVER AMOUNT (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) AND $4.5 MILLION AND CONTINUING FOR A PERIOD OF 60 CONSECUTIVE DAYS AFTER THE FIRST DAY ON WHICH AVAILABILITY EXCEEDS SUCH THRESHOLD AMOUNT. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES OTHER NEGATIVE COVENANTS THAT ARE CUSTOMARY FOR CREDIT FACILITIES OF THIS TYPE, INCLUDING COVENANTS THAT, SUBJECT TO EXCEPTIONS DESCRIBED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF THE BORROWERS AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES (I) TO INCUR ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS; (II) TO MAKE INVESTMENTS; (III) TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS, LOANS OR TRANSFERS OF ASSETS; (IV) TO ENTER INTO, CREATE, INCUR, ASSUME OR SUFFER TO EXIST ANY LIENS, (V) TO SELL ASSETS; (VI) TO ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; (VII) TO MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH, OR DISPOSE OF ALL ASSETS TO A THIRD PARTY, EXCEPT AS PERMITTED THEREBY; (VIII) TO PREPAY INDEBTEDNESS; AND (IX) TO PAY DIVIDENDS.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR THE FOLLOWING EVENTS OF DEFAULT: (I) DEFAULT FOR NON-PAYMENT OF ANY PRINCIPAL OR LETTER OF CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT WHEN DUE OR ANY INTEREST, FEES OR OTHER AMOUNTS WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF THE DUE DATE; (II) THE FAILURE BY ANY BORROWER OR ANY SUBSIDIARY TO COMPLY WITH ANY COVENANT OR AGREEMENT CONTAINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, IN CERTAIN CASES SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE NOTICE AND LAPSE OF TIME; (III) ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE PURSUANT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT IS INCORRECT IN ANY MATERIAL RESPECT WHEN MADE; (IV) CERTAIN DEFAULTS OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OF ANY BORROWER OR ANY SUBSIDIARY OF INDEBTEDNESS OF AT LEAST $10 MILLION; (V) CERTAIN EVENTS OF BANKRUPTCY OR INSOLVENCY WITH RESPECT TO ANY BORROWER OR ANY SUBSIDIARY; (VI) CERTAIN JUDGMENTS FOR THE PAYMENT OF MONEY OF $10 MILLION OR MORE; (VII) A CHANGE OF CONTROL; AND (VIII) CERTAIN DEFAULTS RELATING TO THE LOSS OF FCC LICENSES, CESSATION OF BROADCASTING AND TERMINATION OF MATERIAL STATION CONTRACTS. IF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT OCCURS AND IS CONTINUING, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS MAY ACCELERATE THE AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE ABL FACILITY AND MAY EXERCISE REMEDIES IN RESPECT OF THE COLLATERAL.  WE INCURRED DEBT ISSUE COSTS OF $0.8MILLION THAT WERE RECORDED AS AN ASSET AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED TO NON-CASH INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE ABL FACILITY USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, $50,000 AND $0.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF DEBT ISSUE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOTES WAS AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, $53,000 AND $0.2 MILLION OF DEBT ISSUE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOTES WAS RECOGNIZED AS INTEREST EXPENSE. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE BLENDED INTEREST RATE ON AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE ABL FACILITY WAS 4.11%.  WE REPORT OUTSTANDING BALANCES ON THE ABL FACILITY AS SHORT-TERM REGARDLESS OF THE MATURITY DATE BASED ON USE OF THE ABL FACILITY TO FUND ORDINARY AND CUSTOMARY OPERATING CASH NEEDS WITH FREQUENT REPAYMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY ALLOWS US TO MEET OUR ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS, FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND SATISFY OUR DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.

IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET OVER ITS FAIR VALUE. INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE FINITE USEFUL LIVES CONTINUE TO BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES AND ARE MEASURED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THEY MAY BE IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE RECORDED AS OPERATING EXPENSES. WE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT LOSSES IN PRIOR YEARS WITH REGARD TO OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ESTIMATE OF THE VALUE OF OUR BROADCAST LICENSES, MASTHEADS, AND GOODWILL IS A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE AS THE VALUE IS SIGNIFICANT IN RELATION TO OUR TOTAL ASSETS, AND OUR ESTIMATES INCORPORATE VARIABLES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCES AND JUDGMENT ABOUT FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR MARKETS AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS. IF ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WE USED, WE ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL. THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS USE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT REFLECT OUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE ESTIMATES THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE INCLUDING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT RISK. THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE DEFINED IN FASB ASC TOPIC 820,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES,  AS LEVEL 3 INPUTS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN NOTE 15.  THE VALUATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS SUBJECTIVE AND BASED ON ESTIMATES RATHER THAN PRECISE CALCULATIONS. THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS USE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT REFLECT OUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE ESTIMATES THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE INCLUDING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT RISK. IF ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES WE USED, WE ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, THE AMOUNT OF WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL.

DEFERRED  INCOME TAXES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX  EFFECTS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND TAX  BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES GIVEN THE PROVISIONS OF ENACTED TAX  LAWS. IN PROVIDING FOR DEFERRED TAXES, WE CONSIDER TAX REGULATIONS  OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE  TAXABLE INCOME AND AVAILABLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES.

REVENUE  FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE ENTIRE LINE OF WORKSPORT PRODUCTS WAS $870,053 AND $1,959,027, COMPARED  TO $5,954 AND $300,113 FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  553% WAS MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF INVENTORY TO SATISFY CUSTOMER ORDERS.  FOR  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, REVENUE GENERATED IN CANADA WAS $74,058 COMPARED TO $32,483 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018,  AN INCREASE OF 56%. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, REVENUE GENERATED IN CANADA WAS $49,410 COMPARED TO REFUNDS  OF $6,059 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, AN INCREASE OF 6425%. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASED HIGHER DEMAND IN CANADA,  RESULTING IN CANADIAN MARKET SALES TO INCREASE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED. THE RATE OF EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR AND  THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR DURING THE NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 WAS CONSISTENT, WHICH LIMITED THE HISTORICALLY NEGATIVE EFFECT  ON REPORTED REVENUES AS A RESULT OF TRANSLATING THE SALES DENOMINATED IN CANADIAN DOLLARS TO UNITED STATES DOLLARS FOR FINANCIAL  STATEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, GROSS REVENUE GENERATED IN THE UNITED STATES WAS $2,072,963  COMPARED TO $259,621 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, AN INCREASE OF 1176%. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, GROSS REVENUE  GENERATED IN THE UNITED STATES WAS $924,949 COMPARED TO $4,986 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, AN INCREASE OF 17839%. THIS IS PRIMARILY  ATTRIBUTABLE TO RE-ENTERING THE US MARKET AS OF MID-2018 AND CONTINUING TO INCREASE SALES WHICH INCLUDED ONLINE RETAILERS AND  THE SUPPORT OF FOUR PRIVATE LABELS, AFTER THE ALLOWANCE OF USE OF THE WORKSPORT TRADEMARK.  CURRENTLY,  WORKSPORT WORKS CLOSELY WITH ONE MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR IN CANADA, ALONG WITH ITS OWN CONTRACTED DISTRIBUTION AND INVENTORY FACILITY  IN BREINIGSVILLE, PA AND DEPEW, NY. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT ONLINE RETAILERS.  ALTHOUGH  WORKSPORT CURRENTLY SUPPORTS A TOTAL OF 10 DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WORKSPORT BELIEVES THE TREND OF INCREASING SALES THROUGH  ONLINE RETAILERS WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE THE TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS MODEL. MOREOVER, REPUTABLE ONLINE RETAILER\u2019S  CUSTOMERS TEND TO PROVIDE LARGER SALES VOLUMES, GREATER MARGIN OF PROFIT AS WELL AS GREATER PROTECTION AGAINST PRICE EROSION.  COST  OF SALES  COST OF SALES INCREASED FOR THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, WHEN COMPARED TO THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2018, BY 1,132% AND 383% FROM  $54,270 AND $305,273 TO $668,516 AND $1,473,150. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE HIGHER VOLUME OF SALES FOR  THE FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF 2019 WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018. OUR COST OF SALES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF  SALES, WAS APPROXIMATELY 77% AND 75% COMPARE TO 911% AND 102% FOR THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  WITHIN  COST OF SALES, FREIGHT COSTS ACCOUNTED FOR 2% OF COST OF SALES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHEREAS IN 2018,  IT ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OF COST OF SALES. THE DECREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF COST OF SALES IS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN SALES FOR THE  QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 BEING LARGER US ORDERS WITH ECONOMIES TO SCALE IN SHIPPING. ALSO, IN 2019, RETAIL ONLINE ORDERS  WERE DROP-SHIPPED SALES FOB CHINA TO OUR ONLINE VENDORS REDUCING INTERMEDIARY COSTS.  12  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WORKSPORT  PROVIDES ITS DISTRIBUTORS AND ONLINE RETAILERS AN \u201cALL-IN\u201d WHOLESALE PRICE.

OVERVIEW  THE  COMPANY WAS FORMED IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA ON JULY 13, 1993 AND WAS A CLOSED-END INVESTMENT COMPANY LICENSED BY THE SBA  AS A SBIC. THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY MADE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN, AND PROVIDED LOANS TO, SMALL BUSINESSES TO FINANCE THEIR GROWTH,  EXPANSION, AND DEVELOPMENT. UNDER APPLICABLE SBA REGULATIONS, THE COMPANY WAS RESTRICTED TO INVESTING ONLY IN QUALIFIED SMALL  BUSINESSES AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT ACT OF 1958. AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT  COMPANY ACT, THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE WAS TO PROVIDE ITS SHAREHOLDERS WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF INCOME, WITH CAPITAL  APPRECIATION AS A SECONDARY OBJECTIVE. THE COMPANY MADE ITS FIRST INVESTMENT IN A SMALL BUSINESS IN OCTOBER 1996.  15  IN  MAY 2014 THE COMPANY EFFECTIVELY CEASED OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY CONSENTED TO A COURT ORDER APPOINTING THE SBA AS RECEIVER OF THE  COMPANY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARSHALING AND LIQUIDATING IN AN ORDERLY MANNER ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS. THAT ORDER ALSO  ENTERED JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ON BEHALF OF THE SBA, AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE AMOUNT OF $11,770,722.  THE SBA WAS APPOINTED RECEIVER EFFECTIVE MAY 28, 2014.  OVER  THE COURSE OF THE RECEIVERSHIP THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMPANY WAS LIMITED TO THE LIQUIDATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS BY THE  RECEIVER AND THE PAYMENT OF THE PROCEEDS THEREFROM TO THE SBA AND FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE RECEIVERSHIP. THE SBIC LICENSE GRANTED  TO THE COMPANY BY THE SBA WAS REVOKED BY THE SBA EFFECTIVE MARCH 20, 2017. ON JUNE 28, 2017 THE RECEIVERSHIP WAS TERMINATED. THE  FINAL ORDER SPECIFICALLY STATED THAT \u201cCONTROL OF WATERSIDE SHALL BE UNCONDITIONALLY TRANSFERRED AND RETURNED TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS  C/O RORAN CAPITAL, LLC (\u201cRORAN\u201d) UPON NOTIFICATION OF ENTRY OF THIS ORDER.  UPON  TERMINATION OF THE RECEIVERSHIP, RORAN TOOK POSSESSION OF ALL BOOKS AND RECORDS MADE AVAILABLE TO IT BY THE SBA, AND RORAN HAS  EXPENDED, AND CONTINUES TO EXPEND, ITS OWN FUNDS TO MAINTAIN THE VIABILITY OF THE COMPANY. WITH NO ASSETS AND NO SBIC LICENSE  FROM THE SBA, NO INCOME, AND LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF $10,000,000, IT BECAME CLEAR TO THE COMPANY THAT CONTINUING TO OPERATE AS  A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY WAS IMPOSSIBLE. RORAN PROVIDED ASSURANCES THAT IT WOULD FUND REASONABLE EXPENSES OF THE COMPANY  SO LONG AS PROGRESS WAS BEING MADE TO REORGANIZE THE COMPANY AND SEEK A NEW BUSINESS TO UNDERTAKE OR TO MERGE WITH AN EXISTING  BUSINESS. THE NEW BOARD HAS CONTINUED TO WORK TOWARD ACHIEVING THAT GOAL.  THE  COMPANY IS NO LONGER OPERATING AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. THE COMPANY HAS ENGAGED, AND  INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE, QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS AND PERSONNEL IN ORDER TO BRING THE COMPANY CURRENT IN ITS SEC FILINGS  AND AUDITS. RORAN PAID FOR THE COMPANY TO FILE ALL DELINQUENT SEC FILINGS AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES  THAT AS OF JUNE 28, 2017 IT CEASED TO BE A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY SO IT DID NOT FILE AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2017. INSTEAD, THE COMPANY FILED A FORM 10-K FOR THAT PERIOD. PRIOR TO THE FILING OF THAT 10-K,  ON JANUARY 18, 2018 THE COMPANY FILED WITH THE SEC AN APPLICATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 8(F) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940  FOR AN ORDER DECLARING THAT THE COMPANY HAS CEASED TO BE A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY. IN RESPONSE TO THAT FILING, THE SEC  ISSUED TO THE COMPANY COMMENTS IN A LETTER DATED MAY 16, 2018. THE COMPANY RESPONDED TO THOSE COMMENTS WITH THE FILING OF AN AMENDED  APPLICATION ON JUNE 4, 2018. AS OF THE DATE OF THIS QUARTERLY STATEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS SUBMITTED A FOURTH AMENDED APPLICATION  AND EXPECTS RESOLUTION SOON.  FROM  TIME-TO-TIME, NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ARE ISSUED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d), OR OTHER  STANDARD SETTING BODIES, RELATING TO THE TREATMENT AND RECORDING OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS. UNLESS OTHERWISE DISCUSSED  HEREIN, MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THESE RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON  THE FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES  OUR  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  WHICH WE HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. IN PREPARING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF  CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING  THE REPORTING PERIODS.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE ESTIMATES FOR WHICH (A) THE NATURE OF THE ESTIMATE IS MATERIAL DUE TO THE LEVELS OF SUBJECTIVITY AND  JUDGMENT NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS OR THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SUCH MATTERS TO CHANGE AND (B) THE IMPACT  OF THE ESTIMATE ON FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS MATERIAL.  16  THESE  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS BEAR THE RISK OF CHANGE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES ATTACHED  TO THESE ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS, AND CERTAIN ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO MEASURE OR VALUE.  MANAGEMENT  BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE IN RELATION TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT  THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.  MANAGEMENT  REGULARLY EVALUATES THE KEY FACTORS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DEVELOP THE ESTIMATES UTILIZING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, CHANGES  IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS. AFTER SUCH EVALUATIONS, IF DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THOSE  ESTIMATES ARE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.  ACTUAL  RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  WHILE  OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 2 OF OUR QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS  QUARTERLY REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL TO THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION  OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ASSUMPTION  AS A GOING CONCERN  MANAGEMENT  PREPARES THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON THE BASIS THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, WHICH CONTEMPLATES  CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS, REALIZATION OF ASSETS, AND LIQUIDATION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. HOWEVER, GIVEN  OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL POSITION AND LACK OF LIQUIDITY, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  CONVERTIBLE  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  THE  COMPANY BIFURCATES CONVERSION OPTIONS FROM THEIR HOST INSTRUMENTS AND ACCOUNTS FOR THEM AS FREE STANDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS IF CERTAIN CRITERIA ARE MET. THE CRITERIA INCLUDE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH (A) THE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RISKS  OF THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT ARE NOT CLEARLY AND CLOSELY RELATED TO THE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RISKS OF THE HOST  CONTRACT, (B) THE HYBRID INSTRUMENT THAT EMBODIES BOTH THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AND THE HOST CONTRACT IS NOT RE-MEASURED  AT FAIR VALUE UNDER OTHERWISE APPLICABLE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE REPORTED IN EARNINGS  AS THEY OCCUR AND (C) A SEPARATE INSTRUMENT WITH THE SAME TERMS AS THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A DERIVATIVE  INSTRUMENT. AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE IS WHEN THE HOST INSTRUMENT IS DEEMED TO BE CONVENTIONAL, AS THAT TERM IS DESCRIBED UNDER  APPLICABLE GAAP.  WHEN  THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTIONS SHOULD NOT BE BIFURCATED FROM THEIR HOST INSTRUMENTS, DISCOUNTS  ARE RECORDED FOR THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF CONVERSION OPTIONS EMBEDDED IN THE INSTRUMENTS BASED UPON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE  FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK AT THE COMMITMENT DATE OF THE TRANSACTION AND THE EFFECTIVE CONVERSION PRICE EMBEDDED  IN THE INSTRUMENT.  BENEFICIAL  CONVERSION FEATURE  THE  ISSUANCE OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUED BY THE COMPANY (DESCRIBED IN NOTE 3 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) GENERATED A BENEFICIAL  CONVERSION FEATURE (\u201cBCF\u201d), WHICH ARISES WHEN A DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITY IS ISSUED WITH AN EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTION  THAT IS BENEFICIAL TO THE INVESTOR OR IN THE MONEY AT INCEPTION BECAUSE THE CONVERSION OPTION HAS AN EFFECTIVE STRIKE PRICE THAT  IS LESS THAN THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK AT THE COMMITMENT DATE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED THE BCF BY ALLOCATING THE  INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE CONVERSION OPTION, WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE UPON CONVERSION MULTIPLIED BY  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EFFECTIVE CONVERSION PRICE PER SHARE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF COMMON STOCK PER SHARE ON THE COMMITMENT  DATE, RESULTING IN A DISCOUNT ON THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT (RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF ADDITIONAL PAID IN CAPITAL).  17  FAIR  VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  THE  COMPANY FOLLOWS PARAGRAPH 825-10-50-10 OF THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION FOR DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF ITS FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS AND HAS ADOPTED PARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37 OF THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cPARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37\u201d)  TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. PARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37 ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE  IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP), AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE  MEASUREMENTS. TO INCREASE CONSISTENCY AND COMPARABILITY IN FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES, PARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37  ESTABLISHES A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WHICH PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE INTO THREE  (3) BROAD LEVELS. THE THREE (3) LEVELS OF FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY DEFINED BY PARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37 ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.  LEVEL  1: QUOTED MARKET PRICES AVAILABLE IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AS OF THE REPORTING DATE.  LEVEL  2: PRICING INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1, WHICH ARE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  OBSERVABLE AS OF THE REPORTING DATE.  LEVEL  3: PRICING INPUTS THAT ARE GENERALLY UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND NOT CORROBORATED BY MARKET DATA.  FINANCIAL  ASSETS ARE CONSIDERED LEVEL 3 WHEN THEIR FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED USING PRICING MODELS, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGIES OR  SIMILAR TECHNIQUES AND AT LEAST ONE SIGNIFICANT MODEL ASSUMPTION OR INPUT IS UNOBSERVABLE.  THE  FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES  AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. IF THE INPUTS USED TO MEASURE THE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FALL WITHIN  MORE THAN ONE LEVEL DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE CATEGORIZATION IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE  MEASUREMENT OF THE INSTRUMENT.  TRANSACTIONS  INVOLVING RELATED PARTIES CANNOT BE PRESUMED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON AN ARM\u2019S-LENGTH BASIS, AS THE REQUISITE CONDITIONS OF  COMPETITIVE, FREE-MARKET DEALINGS MAY NOT EXIST. REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES, IF MADE, SHALL NOT IMPLY  THAT THE RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS WERE CONSUMMATED ON TERMS EQUIVALENT TO THOSE THAT PREVAIL IN ARM\u2019S-LENGTH TRANSACTIONS  UNLESS SUCH REPRESENTATIONS CAN BE SUBSTANTIATED.  DEFERRED  TAX ASSETS AND INCOME TAXES PROVISION  THE  COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13 OF THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION. PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13  WHICH ADDRESSES THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER TAX BENEFITS CLAIMED OR EXPECTED TO BE CLAIMED ON A TAX RETURN SHOULD BE RECORDED  IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. UNDER PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13, THE COMPANY MAY RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION  ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON  THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION SHOULD BE MEASURED  BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT (50%) LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.  PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13 ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DE-RECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, INTEREST AND PENALTIES ON INCOME TAXES, ACCOUNTING  IN INTERIM PERIODS AND REQUIRES INCREASED DISCLOSURES. THE COMPANY HAD NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED  INCOME TAX BENEFITS ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13.  THE  ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REPORTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING  BALANCE SHEETS, AS WELL AS TAX CREDIT CARRY-BACKS AND CARRY-FORWARDS. THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REVIEWS THE RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED  TAX ASSETS RECORDED ON ITS BALANCE SHEETS AND PROVIDES VALUATION ALLOWANCES AS MANAGEMENT DEEMS NECESSARY.  MANAGEMENT  MAKES JUDGMENTS AS TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX LAWS THAT MIGHT BE CHALLENGED UPON AN AUDIT AND CAUSE CHANGES TO PREVIOUS  ESTIMATES OF TAX LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY OPERATES WITHIN MULTIPLE TAXING JURISDICTIONS AND IS SUBJECT TO AUDIT IN  THESE JURISDICTIONS. IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S OPINION, ADEQUATE PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ALL YEARS. IF ACTUAL  TAXABLE INCOME BY TAX JURISDICTION VARIES FROM ESTIMATES, ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES OR REVERSALS OF RESERVES MAY BE NECESSARY.  18  MANAGEMENT  ASSUMES THAT THE REALIZATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RESULTING FROM ITS NET OPERATING LOSS (\u201cNOL\u201d)  CARRY\u2013FORWARDS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES THAT MAY BE OFFSET AGAINST FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME WAS NOT CONSIDERED MORE  LIKELY THAN NOT AND ACCORDINGLY, THE POTENTIAL TAX BENEFITS OF THE NET LOSS CARRY-FORWARDS ARE OFFSET BY A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  MANAGEMENT MADE THIS ASSUMPTION BASED ON (A) THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED RECURRING LOSSES AND PRESENTLY HAS NO REVENUE-PRODUCING  BUSINESS, (B) GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND (C) ITS ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT ITS DAILY OPERATIONS BY WAY  OF A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE OFFERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.  COMPARISON  OF THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018  DURING  THE THREE MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY OPERATIONS AND THEREFORE THERE WERE NO  REVENUES. EXPENSES WERE LIMITED TO MAINTAINING THE COMPANY IN GOOD STANDING AND STAYING CURRENT, RESPECTIVELY, IN ITS FILING OBLIGATIONS  WITH THE SEC.  ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSE  PROFESSIONAL  FEES TOTALED $12,796 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $8,223 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2018. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO MORE ACTIVITY IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AS THE CURRENT COMPARABLE PERIOD REQUIRED MORE EXPENDITURES  FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES TO BRING THE COMPANY CURRENT IN ITS SEC FILINGS.  INTEREST  EXPENSE  INTEREST  EXPENSE TOTALED $22,661 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $21,165 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2018. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BORROWING UNDER THE CONVERTIBLE LOAN FACILITY.  NET  LOSS  WE  REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $35,547 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $29,388 IN THE COMPARABLE  PERIOD OF 2018. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSES AND PROFESSIONAL FEES.  19  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE  HAVE INCURRED RECURRING OPERATING LOSSES AND NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN FISCAL 2018 AND THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AND  WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR OPERATING LOSSES AND NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AT LEAST THROUGH THE NEAR FUTURE. WE HAVE OBTAINED  FUNDING THROUGH A CONVERTIBLE LOAN FACILITY OF UP TO $200,000 IN ORDER TO PARTIALLY MEET OUR MOST CRITICAL CASH REQUIREMENTS,  AND OF THIS AMOUNT, WE HAVE DRAWN APPROXIMATELY $184,338 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. RORAN HAS AGREED TO EXTEND THE LOAN  UNTIL NEGOTIATIONS HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED.  AS  A RESULT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED FACTORS, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE  AS A GOING CONCERN. OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, IN ITS REPORT ON OUR FISCAL 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  RAISED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 DO NOT CONTAIN ANY ADJUSTMENTS FOR THIS UNCERTAINTY. IN RESPONSE TO OUR COMPANY\u2019S CASH NEEDS, WE  RAISED FUNDING AS DESCRIBED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ANY ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS RAISED WILL BE USED FOR OUR FUTURE INVESTING AND  OPERATING CASH FLOW NEEDS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS OF FINANCING.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S  PLANS  OUR  PLAN IS TO SEEK, INVESTIGATE, AND CONSUMMATE A MERGER OR OTHER BUSINESS COMBINATION, PURCHASE OF ASSETS OR OTHER STRATEGIC TRANSACTION  (I.E. A MERGER) WITH A CORPORATION, PARTNERSHIP, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OR OTHER OPERATING BUSINESS ENTITY, OR ENTER INTO A  NEW BUSINESS (COLLECTIVELY, A \u201cBUSINESS TARGET\u201d) DESIRING THE PERCEIVED ADVANTAGES OF BECOMING A PUBLICLY REPORTING  AND PUBLICLY HELD CORPORATION. WE HAVE NO OPERATING BUSINESS, AND CONDUCT MINIMAL OPERATIONS NECESSARY TO MEET REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.  OUR ABILITY TO COMMENCE ANY OPERATIONS IS CONTINGENT UPON OBTAINING ADEQUATE FINANCIAL RESOURCES.  WE  ARE NOT CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN ANY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT PROVIDE CASH FLOW. THE COSTS OF INVESTIGATING AND ANALYZING BUSINESS  COMBINATIONS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND BEYOND SUCH TIME WILL BE PAID WITH MONEY BORROWED FROM RORAN.  DURING  THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, WE ANTICIPATE INCURRING COSTS RELATED TO (I) FILING OF EXCHANGE ACT REPORTS; AND, (II) IDENTIFYING AND  CONSUMMATING A TRANSACTION WITH A BUSINESS TARGET. WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THESE COSTS THROUGH USE OF FUNDS BORROWED  FROM RORAN, OR OTHER AMOUNTS TO BE LOANED TO OR INVESTED IN US BY OTHER INVESTORS.  WE  MAY CONSIDER A BUSINESS WHICH HAS RECENTLY COMMENCED OPERATIONS, IS A DEVELOPING COMPANY IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EXPANSION  INTO NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS, IS SEEKING TO DEVELOP A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE, OR IS AN ESTABLISHED BUSINESS WHICH MAY BE EXPERIENCING  FINANCIAL OR OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND IS IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, A BUSINESS COMBINATION MAY INVOLVE  THE ACQUISITION OF, OR MERGER WITH, A COMPANY WHICH DOES NOT NEED SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, BUT WHICH DESIRES TO ESTABLISH  A PUBLIC TRADING MARKET FOR ITS SHARES, WHILE AVOIDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TIME DELAYS, SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE, AND LOSS OF  VOTING CONTROL WHICH MAY OCCUR IN A PUBLIC OFFERING.  ZINDEL  ZELMANOVITCH IS OUR PRESIDENT, SECRETARY AND OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. MR. ZELMANOVITCH IS ONLY REQUIRED TO DEVOTE A SMALL  PORTION OF HIS TIME TO OUR AFFAIRS ON A PART-TIME OR AS-NEEDED BASIS. NO COMPENSATION HAS BEEN PAID TO MR. ZELMANOVITCH FOR HIS  SERVICES AS AN OFFICER AND DIRECTOR. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE HIRING ANY FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES AS LONG AS WE ARE SEEKING AND EVALUATING  BUSINESS TARGETS.  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD ONLY $11,197 CASH ON HAND. SINCE WE HAVE NO REVENUE OR PLANS TO GENERATE ANY REVENUE, WE WILL  BE DEPENDENT UPON LOANS TO FUND EXPENSES INCURRED IN EXCESS OF OUR CASH. ALSO, RELATED PARTY OBLIGATIONS TOTALING $212,541  ARE DUE AND PAYABLE AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THERE  ARE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION,  CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES  THAT ARE MATERIAL TO INVESTORS.  20", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "WATERSIDE CAPITAL CORP", "CIK": 924095, "Date": "2019-11-19T00:00:00", "Ticker": "WSCC", "Name": "Waterside Capital Corp", "Exchange": "OTC", "SIC": null, "Business": "VA", "Incorporated": "VA", "IRS": 541694665.0, "key": "20191119WSCC", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.64357096, "prof1": 0.35642904, "return1&2": 1.0, "return1&2&3": 1.0, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.07305372082489164, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3453, "returnpred": -0.0, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0092110159685965, "cumreturn1b": 1.1628639327072243, "cumreturn1c": 1.0317352970514289, "cumreturndow": 1.0135478544177075, "cumreturnsp500": 1.017322713410973}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3463, "level_0": 3553, "index": 36044, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS RELATE TO OUR PLANS, LIQUIDITY, ABILITY TO COMPLETE FINANCING AND PURCHASE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS INCLUDING ENTERING INTO FUTURE AGREEMENTS WITH COMPANIES, AND PLANS TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND OBTAIN APPROVAL TO MARKET OUR PRODUCT. WE HAVE BASED THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS LARGELY ON OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS AND FINANCIAL TRENDS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BUSINESS STRATEGY AND FINANCIAL NEEDS.  YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES ATTACHED HERETO, AND THE OTHER FINANCIAL DATA APPEARING ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.  US DOLLARS ARE DENOTED HEREIN BY \u201cUSD\u201d, \u201c$\u201d AND \u201cDOLLARS\u201d.  OVERVIEW  UMATRIN HOLDING LIMITED (\u201cUMHL\u201d) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE ON FEBRUARY 2, 2005. UMHL WAS ORIGINALLY INCORPORATED IN ORDER TO LOCATE AND NEGOTIATE WITH A TARGETED BUSINESS ENTITY FOR THE COMBINATION OF THAT TARGET COMPANY WITH THE COMPANY.  ON JANUARY 6, 2016, UMHL ACQUIRED 80% OF THE EQUITY INTERESTS OF UMATRIN WORLDWIDE SDN. BHD. (\u201cUMATRIN\u201d) IN EXCHANGE FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A TOTAL OF 100,000,000 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK TO THE TWO HOLDERS OF UMATRIN, DATO\u2019 SRI EU HIN CHAI AND DATO\u2019 LIEW KOK HONG. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE SHARE EXCHANGE, THE BUSINESS OF UMATRIN BECAME THE BUSINESS OF UMHL. THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATION OFFICE REMAINED IN MALAYSIA AND THE BUSINESS MARKET WILL REMAIN FOCUS IN ASIA.  UMATRIN, FORMERLY KNOWN AS OLC WORLDWIDE SDN. BHD., WAS INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA ON JULY 22, 1993. UMATRIN HAS CURATED NONTOXIC BEAUTY, PERSONAL CARE TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS PRODUCTS. WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH THREE PRIMARY METHODS: DIRECT CONTACT, ONLINE DISTRIBUTION AND/OR BY OUR DEALER PROGRAM. WE APPLY LEADING O2O (ONLINE TO OFFLINE) MARKETING STRATEGY TO BOTH RETAIL AND WHOLESALE TRADE. WE PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY AND SERVICES TO ENABLE CONSUMERS, MERCHANTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS TO CONDUCT BUSINESS IN OUR CLOUD BASED TRADING SYSTEM. WE USE ADVANCED NETWORK TECHNOLOGY AND RIGOROUS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO CREATE UNLIMITED BUSINESS BRAND SPACE. WITHOUT ALLOCATING LARGE SUMS OF OPERATING COST, IT CONTINUOUSLY INTRODUCES NEW PRODUCTS, COMBINED WITH O2O INTERNET BUSINESS MODEL AND CAREER OPPORTUNITIES.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2019 AND 2018  SALES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY GENERATED $308,784 IN REVENUES, WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF $175,104, OR 130% COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THIS IS DUE TO INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME FOR AKERO PRODUCT SERIES AND OLD PRODUCTS. INCREASING IN SALES IS ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY HAS INCREASED ITS MARKETING STAFF TO PROMOTE ITS PRODUCTS SINCE APRIL 2019 AND, THE MARKET AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN MALAYSIA HAVE IMPROVED SINCE THE 2018 GENERAL ELECTION.  GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN  THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO GENERATE A GROSS PROFIT MARGIN OF $185,504 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF $55,664 OR 42% COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THIS IS DUE TO INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME FOR NEW AKERO PRODUCT SERIES WHICH HAS A HIGHER PROFIT MARGIN.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS  MAJOR OPERATING COSTS INCLUDE SALARIES AND WAGES, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCREASED FROM $139,107 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 TO $194,161 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THE INCREASE IS DUE TO INCREASE IN OPERATING COST SUCH AS INCREASE IN COMMISSION EXPENSES, PRINTING AND STATIONERIES.  NET INCOME  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD $14,662 IN NET LOSS AS COMPARED TO $15,368 IN NET LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WHICH WAS A DECREASE IN NET LOSS OF $706. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT NEW MARKETING STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE ITS FINANCIAL POSITION.  COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2019 AND 2018  SALES  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY GENERATED $902,750 IN REVENUES, WHICH HAS AN INCREASE OF $623,857, OR 223% COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THIS IS DUE TO INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME FOR AKERO PRODUCT SERIES.  GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN  THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO GENERATE A GROSS PROFIT MARGIN OF $685,079 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH HAS AN INCREASE OF $428,391 OR 166% COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THIS IS DUE TO INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME FOR NEW AKERO PRODUCT SERIES WHICH HAS HIGHER PROFIT MARGIN.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS  MAJOR OPERATING COSTS INCLUDE SALARIES AND WAGES, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCREASED FROM $404,874 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 TO $549,483 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THE INCREASE IS DUE TO INCREASE IN OPERATING COST SUCH AS INCREASE IN COMMISSION EXPENSES, PRINTING AND STATIONERIES.  NET INCOME  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD $117,453 IN NET PROFIT AS COMPARED TO $166,990 IN NET LOSS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WHICH WAS AN INCREASE IN NET PROFIT OF $284,443. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT NEW MARKETING STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE ITS FINANCIAL POSITION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT OF $150,037 AND $36,431 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  OUR COMPANY'S OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN FUNDED THROUGH AN EQUITY FINANCING AND A SERIES OF DEBT TRANSACTIONS, PRIMARILY WITH SHAREHOLDERS, DIRECTORS, AND OFFICERS OF OUR COMPANY AND AFFILIATED ENTITIES. THESE RELATED PARTY DEBT TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS ADVANCES HAVE OPERATED AS INFORMAL LINES OF CREDIT SINCE THE INCEPTION OF OUR COMPANY, AND RELATED PARTIES HAVE EXTENDED CREDIT AS NEEDED WHICH OUR COMPANY HAS REPAID AT ITS CONVENIENCE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL INCUR OPERATING LOSSES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND WE BELIEVE WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL CASH TO SUPPORT OUR DAILY OPERATIONS WHILE WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND PRODUCE REVENUES. IF OUR RELATED PARTIES ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, WE WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE FINANCING FROM THIRD PARTIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US, ON TERMS WE BELIEVE TO BE FAVORABLE OR AT ALL. THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION AND COULD FORCE US TO CURTAIL OR DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS ENTIRELY AND/OR FILE FOR PROTECTION UNDER BANKRUPTCY LAWS.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH INFORMATION ABOUT OUR NET CASH FLOW FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018.

THE MOVEMENT IN NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES RESULTED FROM THE MOVEMENT IN INVENTORY, PREPAID TAX, OTHER RECEIVABLES AND DEPOSITS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER PAYABLES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WE USED $2,841 IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES AS COMPARED TO USING $NIL IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE MOVEMENT IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITY RESULTED FROM PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE USED $130,316 IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES AS COMPARED TO GENERATING $169,760 IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES RESULTED FROM NET REPAYMENT TO RELATED PARTY OF $80,131 AND NET REPAYMENT TO TERM LOAN OF $50,184.  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES RESULTED FROM NET PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM RELATED PARTY OF $184,372 AND NET REPAYMENT TO TERM LOAN OF $14,612.  LOAN COMMITMENT  ON DECEMBER 23, 2014, MYR 2,300,000 (APPROXIMATELY $657,507) TERM LOAN WAS GRANTED TO UMATRIN FOR THE PURCHASE OF FOUR STORY SHOP OFFICES LOCATED AT NO.32, 32-1, 32-2, 32-3, JALAN RADIN BAGUS 3, BANDAR BARU SERI PETALING, 57000, KUALA LUMPUR WITH A REPAYMENT PERIOD OF 240 MONTHS. THIS TERM LOAN WAS SECURED BY (I) TITLE DEED FOR THE SAID PROPERTY, AND (II) WAY OF GUARANTEE BY DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY. THIS TERM LOAN IS SUBJECT TO AN INTEREST CHARGES AT 2.10% PER ANNUM BELOW THE BANK'S BASE LENDING RATE (\"BLR\") WITH DAILY RESTS.

INTEREST EXPENSES WERE $18,143 AND $18,804 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  WE HAVE NO KNOWN DEMANDS OR COMMITMENTS AND WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY EVENTS OR UNCERTAINTIES AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 THAT WILL RESULT IN OR THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY INCREASE OR DECREASE OUR CURRENT LIQUIDITY.  WE HAD NO MATERIAL COMMITMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018 EXCEPT MENTIONED ABOVE.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GOING CONCERN  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS. AS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAD ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $3,339,354 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WHICH INCLUDE A PROFIT OF $117,453 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. WE EXPECT TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR EXISTING CASH, OUR OPERATIONS AND ANY FUTURE FINANCING. HOWEVER, THERE EXISTS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN BECAUSE WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH CAPITAL, THROUGH EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING, OR ANY COMBINATION THEREOF, OR ON SATISFACTORY TERMS OR AT ALL. ADDITIONALLY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT ANY SUCH FINANCING, IF OBTAINED, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR CAPITAL NEEDS. IF ADEQUATE CAPITAL CANNOT BE OBTAINED ON A TIMELY BASIS AND ON SATISFACTORY TERMS, OUR OPERATIONS WOULD BE MATERIALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  OVERVIEW  BRADY CORPORATION IS A GLOBAL MANUFACTURER AND SUPPLIER OF IDENTIFICATION SOLUTIONS AND WORKPLACE SAFETY PRODUCTS THAT IDENTIFY AND PROTECT PREMISES, PRODUCTS AND PEOPLE. THE IDS SEGMENT IS PRIMARILY INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE AND INNOVATIVE IDENTIFICATION AND HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS. THE WPS SEGMENT PROVIDES WORKPLACE SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE PRODUCTS, APPROXIMATELY HALF OF WHICH ARE INTERNALLY MANUFACTURED AND HALF OF WHICH ARE EXTERNALLY SOURCED.  THE LONG-TERM SALES GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR SEGMENTS WILL DEPEND NOT ONLY ON IMPROVED DEMAND IN END MARKETS AND  THE OVERALL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, BUT ALSO ON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, FOCUS ON THE CUSTOMER, DEVELOP AND MARKET INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS, AND TO ADVANCE OUR DIGITAL CAPABILITIES. IN OUR IDENTIFICATION SOLUTIONS (\"ID SOLUTIONS\" OR \"IDS\") BUSINESS, OUR STRATEGY FOR GROWTH INCLUDES AN INCREASED FOCUS ON CERTAIN INDUSTRIES AND PRODUCTS, A FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE CUSTOMER BUYING EXPERIENCE, AND INCREASING INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\"R&D\") TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS. IN OUR WORKPLACE SAFETY (\"WPS\") BUSINESS, OUR STRATEGY FOR GROWTH INCLUDES A FOCUS ON WORKPLACE SAFETY CRITICAL INDUSTRIES, INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS, COMPLIANCE EXPERTISE, CUSTOMIZATION EXPERTISE, AND IMPROVING OUR DIGITAL CAPABILITIES.  THE FOLLOWING ARE KEY INITIATIVES SUPPORTING THE STRATEGY IN FISCAL 2020.  \u2022  ENHANCING OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND IMPROVING THE TIME TO LAUNCH HIGH-VALUE, INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS IN ALIGNMENT WITH OUR TARGET MARKETS.  \u2022  PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.  \u2022  DRIVING OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND EXECUTING SUSTAINABLE EFFICIENCY GAINS WITHIN OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND WITHIN OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES.  \u2022  EXPANDING AND ENHANCING OUR SALES CAPABILITIES THROUGH AN IMPROVED DIGITAL PRESENCE AND INCREASED SALES RESOURCES.  \u2022  GROWING THROUGH FOCUSED ACTIONS IN SELECTED VERTICAL MARKETS AND STRATEGIC ACCOUNTS.  \u2022  ENHANCING OUR EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS TO CREATE AN ENGAGED WORKFORCE AND TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY TALENT.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  A COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  IS AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019%  SALES  2018%  SALES  NET SALES  $286,947  $293,196  GROSS MARGIN  141,405  49.3%  146,539  50.0%  OPERATING EXPENSES.

THE COMPANY'S ORGANIC SALES DISCLOSURES EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY THAT CAN OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF ORGANIC SALES IS MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS AS IT PROVIDES THEM WITH USEFUL INFORMATION TO AID IN IDENTIFYING UNDERLYING SALES TRENDS IN OUR BUSINESSES AND FACILITATING COMPARISONS OF OUR SALES PERFORMANCE WITH PRIOR PERIODS.  NET SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , DECREASED  2.1%  TO  $286.9 MILLION  , COMPARED TO  $293.2 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE CONSISTED OF AN ORGANIC SALES DECLINE OF  0.4%  AND A DECREASE FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION OF  1.7%  . ORGANIC SALES DECLINED  0.2%  IN THE IDS SEGMENT AND DECLINED  0.8%  IN THE WPS SEGMENT DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE IDS SEGMENT REALIZED SALES GROWTH IN THE  SAFETY AND FACILITY ID PRODUCT LINE, AND REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT TO SLIGHTLY DOWN IN THE PRODUCT ID, WIRE ID AND HEALTHCARE ID PRODUCT LINES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THE WPS SEGMENT REALIZED LOW-SINGLE DIGIT SALES GROWTH IN DIGITAL SALES, WHILE SALES THROUGH THE CATALOG CHANNEL DECLINED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GROSS MARGIN FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , DECREASED  3.5%  TO  $141.4  MILLION, COMPARED TO  $146.5  MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, GROSS MARGIN DECREASED TO  49.3%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , FROM  50.0%  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INPUT COSTS SUCH AS PERSONNEL, MATERIAL, TARIFF, AND FREIGHT COSTS, ALONG WITH REDUCED SALES VOLUME, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND DRIVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, INCLUDING INCREASED AUTOMATION IN OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\u201cR&D\u201d) EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , DECREASED  3.2%  TO  $11.0 MILLION  , COMPARED TO  $11.3 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, R&D EXPENSES REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN R&D SPENDING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF EXPENDITURES RELATED TO ONGOING NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. THE COMPANY REMAINS COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TO INCREASE SALES WITHIN OUR IDS AND WPS BUSINESSES. INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRINTERS AND MATERIALS CONTINUE TO BE THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF R&D EXPENDITURES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (\"SG&A\") INCLUDE SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE IDS AND WPS SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDING FINANCE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, HUMAN RESOURCES, AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. SG&A DECREASED  5.3%  TO  $89.5 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $94.6 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, SG&A WAS  31.2%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  32.3%  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF THE DECREASE IN SG&A WAS DUE TO THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, AND THE REMAINDER WAS DUE TO ONGOING EFFICIENCY GAINS AND CONTINUED EFFORTS TO REDUCE SG&A COSTS.  OPERATING INCOME WAS  $40.9 MILLION  AND  $40.6 MILLION  FOR  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SEGMENT PROFIT IN THE IDS SEGMENT AND REDUCED SG&A IN BOTH SEGMENTS.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES HELD IN DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS AND AN INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  INTEREST EXPENSE REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT AT  $0.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , FROM  $0.7 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR AS THERE WAS MINIMAL CHANGE IN THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL BALANCE UNDER ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT AGREEMENTS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE COMPANY\u2019S INCOME TAX RATE WAS  9.8%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  23.2%  IN THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

ORGANIC SALES GREW IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS IN THE UNITED STATES AND DECLINED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS IN THE REST OF THE AMERICAS.  ORGANIC SALES IN EUROPE DECREASED IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN THE SAFETY AND FACILITY ID PRODUCT LINE. THE ORGANIC SALES DECLINE WAS DUE TO BUSINESSES IN EMERGING GEOGRAPHIES DUE TO A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT CERTAIN BUSINESSES BASED IN WESTERN EUROPE.  ORGANIC SALES IN ASIA DECREASED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN THE SAFETY AND FACILITY ID AND PRODUCT ID PRODUCT LINES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN THE WIRE ID PRODUCT LINE. ORGANIC SALES DECLINED IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGITS WITHIN CHINA PARTIALLY DUE TO THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACT OF TARIFFS, AND REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT IN THE REST OF ASIA.  SEGMENT PROFIT INCREASED  2.1%  TO  $42.4 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $41.6 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

SALES THROUGHOUT THE REST OF EUROPE REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT. SALES THROUGH THE DIGITAL CHANNEL INCREASED IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGITS WHILE SALES THROUGH THE CATALOG CHANNEL DECREASED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS.  ORGANIC SALES IN THE AMERICAS DECLINED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A LOW-SINGLE DIGIT DECLINE IN CATALOG SALES AND A SLIGHT DECLINE IN SALES THROUGH THE DIGITAL CHANNEL. THIS BUSINESS CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON SALES FROM A DIGITAL PLATFORM THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN FISCAL 2018 AND TRANSITIONED TO A NEW DIGITAL PLATFORM IN FISCAL 2019 TO ADDRESS THIS DECLINE. THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE NEW DIGITAL PLATFORM HAS IMPROVED COMPARED TO THE FORMER DIGITAL PLATFORM; HOWEVER, SALES HAVE NOT YET RETURNED TO THE LEVEL EXPERIENCED PRIOR TO THE INITIAL PLATFORM CHANGE IN FISCAL 2018.  ORGANIC SALES IN AUSTRALIA DECLINED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS IN BOTH THE DIGITAL AND TRADITIONAL CATALOG CHANNEL FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PAYMENTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $7.2 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $5.7 MILLION  USED IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

ON MAY 13, 2010, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF \u20ac75.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES TO ACCREDITED INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS.

ON AUGUST 1, 2019, THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO AN UNSECURED $200 MILLION MULTI-CURRENCY REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT WITH A GROUP OF FIVE BANKS THAT REPLACED AND TERMINATED THE COMPANY\u2019S PREVIOUS LOAN AGREEMENT THAT HAD BEEN ENTERED INTO ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2015. UNDER THE NEW REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS THE OPTION TO SELECT EITHER A BASE INTEREST RATE (BASED UPON THE HIGHER OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE PLUS ONE-HALF OF 1% OR THE PRIME RATE OF THE BANK OF MONTREAL PLUS A MARGIN BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED NET LEVERAGE RATIO), OR THE EUROCURRENCY INTEREST RATE (AT THE LIBOR RATE PLUS A MARGIN BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED NET LEVERAGE RATIO) PLUS 1%. AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, THE AVAILABLE AMOUNT UNDER THE REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT MAY BE INCREASED FROM $200 MILLION TO $400 MILLION.

ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT, BASED ON INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO US AND OUR MANAGEMENT, THE EXPECTATIONS REFLECTED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE REASONABLE, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS, LEVELS OF ACTIVITY, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS. YOU SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING PROVIDER OF ONLINE AUCTIONS AND VEHICLE REMARKETING SERVICES WITH OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cU.S.\u201d), CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM (\u201cU.K.\u201d), BRAZIL, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, GERMANY, FINLAND, THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (\u201cU.A.E.\u201d), OMAN, BAHRAIN, AND SPAIN.  OUR GOALS ARE TO GENERATE SUSTAINABLE PROFITS FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS, WHILE ALSO PROVIDING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS FOR THE WORLD AROUND US. WITH RESPECT TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, WE BELIEVE OUR BUSINESS IS A CRITICAL ENABLER FOR THE GLOBAL RE-USE AND RECYCLING OF VEHICLES, PARTS AND RAW MATERIALS. MANY OF THE CARS WE PROCESS AND REMARKET ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RESTORED TO DRIVABLE CONDITION, REDUCING THE NEW VEHICLE MANUFACTURING BURDEN THE WORLD WOULD OTHERWISE FACE. MANY OF OUR CARS ARE PURCHASED BY DISMANTLERS, WHO RECYCLE AND REFURBISH PARTS FOR VEHICLE REPAIRS, AGAIN REDUCING NEW AND AFTERMARKET PARTS MANUFACTURING. AND FINALLY, SOME OF OUR VEHICLES ARE RETURNED TO THEIR RAW MATERIAL INPUTS THROUGH SCRAPPING, REDUCING THE NEED FOR FURTHER DE NOVO RESOURCE EXTRACTION. IN EACH CASE, OUR BUSINESS HAS REDUCED THE CARBON AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT OF THE GLOBAL TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY. BEYOND OUR ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, WE ALSO SUPPORT THE WORLD\u2019S COMMUNITIES IN TWO IMPORTANT WAYS. FIRST, WE BELIEVE THAT WE CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND WELL-BEING BY ENABLING MORE AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO MOBILITY AROUND THE WORLD. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY OF THE AUTOMOBILES SOLD THROUGH OUR AUCTION PLATFORM ARE PURCHASED FOR USE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES WHERE AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION IS A CRITICAL ENABLER OF EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, AND WELL-BEING MORE GENERALLY. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL ROLE WE PLAY IN RESPONDING TO CATASTROPHIC WEATHER EVENTS, WE BELIEVE WE CONTRIBUTE TO DISASTER RECOVERY AND RESILIENCE IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MOBILIZED OUR PEOPLE, ENTERED INTO EMERGENCY LEASES, AND ENGAGED WITH A MULTITUDE OF SERVICE PROVIDERS TO TIMELY RETRIEVE, STORE, AND REMARKET TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FLOOD-DAMAGED VEHICLES IN THE HOUSTON, TEXAS METROPOLITAN AREA IN THE WAKE OF HURRICANE HARVEY IN THE SUMMER OF 2017.  WE PROVIDE VEHICLE SELLERS WITH A FULL RANGE OF SERVICES TO PROCESS AND SELL VEHICLES PRIMARILY OVER THE INTERNET THROUGH OUR VIRTUAL BIDDING THIRD GENERATION INTERNET AUCTION-STYLE SALES TECHNOLOGY, WHICH WE REFER TO AS VB3. VEHICLE SELLERS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF INSURANCE COMPANIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDE BANKS, FINANCE COMPANIES, CHARITIES, FLEET OPERATORS, DEALERS AND VEHICLES SOURCED DIRECTLY FROM INDIVIDUAL OWNERS. WE SELL THE VEHICLES PRINCIPALLY TO LICENSED VEHICLE DISMANTLERS, REBUILDERS, REPAIR LICENSEES, USED VEHICLE DEALERS AND EXPORTERS AND, AT CERTAIN LOCATIONS, TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE MAJORITY OF THE VEHICLES SOLD ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE EITHER DAMAGED VEHICLES DEEMED A TOTAL LOSS; NOT ECONOMICALLY REPAIRABLE BY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES; OR ARE RECOVERED STOLEN VEHICLES FOR WHICH AN INSURANCE SETTLEMENT WITH THE VEHICLE OWNER HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE. WE OFFER VEHICLE SELLERS A FULL RANGE OF SERVICES THAT HELP EXPEDITE EACH STAGE OF THE VEHICLE SALES PROCESS, MINIMIZE ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROCESSING COSTS, AND MAXIMIZE THE ULTIMATE SALES PRICE THROUGH THE ONLINE AUCTION PROCESS.  IN THE U.S., CANADA, BRAZIL, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, FINLAND, THE U.A.E., OMAN, AND BAHRAIN, WE SELL VEHICLES PRIMARILY AS AN AGENT AND DERIVE REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM AUCTION AND AUCTION RELATED SALES TRANSACTION FEES CHARGED FOR VEHICLE REMARKETING SERVICES AS WELL AS FEES FOR SERVICES SUBSEQUENT TO THE AUCTION, SUCH AS DELIVERY AND STORAGE. IN THE U.K., GERMANY, AND SPAIN, WE OPERATE BOTH AS AN AGENT AND ON A PRINCIPAL BASIS, IN SOME CASES PURCHASING SALVAGE VEHICLES OUTRIGHT AND RESELLING THE VEHICLES FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT. IN GERMANY AND SPAIN, WE ALSO DERIVE REVENUE FROM LISTING VEHICLES ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE EXPERTS TO DETERMINE THE VEHICLE\u2019S RESIDUAL VALUE AND/OR TO FACILITATE A SALE FOR THE INSURED.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE MONITOR AND ANALYZE A NUMBER OF KEY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS AND EVALUATE OUR FINANCIAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE. SUCH INDICATORS INCLUDE.  SERVICE AND VEHICLE SALES REVENUE.  OUR SERVICE REVENUE CONSISTS OF AUCTION AND AUCTION RELATED SALES TRANSACTION FEES CHARGED FOR VEHICLE REMARKETING SERVICES. THESE AUCTION AND AUCTION RELATED SERVICES MAY INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF VEHICLE PURCHASING FEES, VEHICLE LISTING FEES, AND VEHICLE SELLING FEES THAT CAN BE BASED ON A PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF THE VEHICLE SALES PRICE, TIERED VEHICLE SALES PRICE DRIVEN FEES, OR AT A FIXED FEE BASED ON THE SALE OF EACH VEHICLE REGARDLESS OF THE SELLING PRICE OF THE VEHICLE; TRANSPORTATION FEES FOR THE COST OF TRANSPORTING THE VEHICLE TO OR FROM OUR FACILITY; TITLE PROCESSING AND PREPARATION FEES; VEHICLE STORAGE FEES; BIDDING FEES; AND VEHICLE LOADING FEES. THESE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED AS NET REVENUE (NOT GROSS VEHICLE SELLING PRICE) AT THE TIME OF AUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF SUCH FEES CHARGED. PURCHASED VEHICLE REVENUE INCLUDES THE GROSS SALES PRICE OF THE VEHICLES WHICH WE HAVE PURCHASED OR ARE OTHERWISE CONSIDERED TO OWN. WE HAVE CERTAIN CONTRACTS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, PRIMARILY IN THE U.K., IN WHICH WE ACT AS A PRINCIPAL, PURCHASING VEHICLES AND RESELLING THEM FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT. WE ALSO PURCHASE VEHICLES IN THE OPEN MARKET, PRIMARILY FROM INDIVIDUALS, AND RESELL THEM FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT.  OUR REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY AND THE AVERAGE VEHICLE AUCTION SELLING PRICE, AS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SERVICE REVENUE IS ASSOCIATED IN SOME MANNER WITH THE ULTIMATE SELLING PRICE OF THE VEHICLE. VEHICLE AUCTION SELLING PRICES ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY: (I) DOMESTIC AND MARKET DEMAND FOR REBUILDABLE, DRIVABLE VEHICLES; (II) USED CAR PRICING, WHICH WE ALSO BELIEVE HAS AN IMPACT ON TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY; (III) END MARKET DEMAND FOR RECYCLED AND REFURBISHED PARTS AS REFLECTED IN DEMAND FROM DISMANTLERS; (IV) THE MIX OF CARS SOLD; (V) CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE HAS AN IMPACT ON AUCTION PARTICIPATION BY INTERNATIONAL BUYERS; AND (VI) CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, PARTICULARLY THE PER TON PRICE FOR CRUSHED CAR BODIES, AS WE BELIEVE THIS HAS AN IMPACT ON THE ULTIMATE SELLING PRICE OF VEHICLES SOLD FOR SCRAP AND VEHICLES SOLD FOR DISMANTLING. WE CANNOT SPECIFICALLY QUANTIFY THE FINANCIAL IMPACT THAT COMMODITY PRICING, USED CAR PRICING, AND PRODUCT SALES MIX HAS ON THE SELLING PRICE OF VEHICLES, OUR SERVICE REVENUES OR FINANCIAL RESULTS. TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY IS THE PERCENTAGE OF CARS INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES SALVAGE RATHER THAN REPAIR AND IS DRIVEN BY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REPAIR COSTS, USED CAR VALUES, AND AUCTION RETURNS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN OVERALL GROWTH IN THE SALVAGE MARKET DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY MAY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY THE DECLINE IN USED CAR VALUES RELATIVE TO REPAIR COSTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE GENERALLY TRENDING UPWARD. CONVERSELY, INCREASES IN USED CAR PRICES, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING THE MOST RECENT RECESSION, MAY DECREASE TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROWTH RATE. USED CAR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING USED CAR SUPPLY, WHICH IS TIED DIRECTLY TO NEW CAR SALES, AND THE AVERAGE AGE OF CARS ON THE ROAD. THE AVERAGE AGE OF CARS ON THE ROAD CONTINUED TO INCREASE, GROWING FROM 9.6 YEARS IN 2002 TO 11.8 YEARS IN 2019. THE FACTORS THAT CAN INFLUENCE REPAIR COSTS, USED CAR PRICING, AND AUCTION RETURNS ARE MANY AND VARIED AND WE CANNOT PREDICT THEIR MOVEMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE TRENDS IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY.  OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES.  YARD OPERATIONS EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF OPERATING PERSONNEL (WHICH INCLUDES YARD MANAGEMENT, CLERICAL AND YARD EMPLOYEES), RENT, CONTRACT VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION, INSURANCE, FUEL, EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR, AND COSTS OF VEHICLES SOLD UNDER THE PURCHASE CONTRACTS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING, SALES PERSONNEL, HUMAN RESOURCES, PROFESSIONAL FEES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND MARKETING EXPENSES.  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.  OTHER INCOME PRIMARILY INCLUDES INCOME FROM THE RENTAL OF CERTAIN REAL PROPERTY, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE GAINS AND LOSSES, AND GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, WHICH WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THESE ACTIVITIES EACH PERIOD. OTHER EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON LONG-TERM DEBT. SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  3 \u2013 LONG-TERM DEBT.  LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF WORKING CAPITAL IS CASH OPERATING RESULTS AND DEBT FINANCING. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OUR LIQUIDITY IS OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY. THE PRIMARY FACTORS AFFECTING CASH OPERATING RESULTS ARE: (I) SEASONALITY; (II) MARKET WINS AND LOSSES; (III) SUPPLIER MIX; (IV) ACCIDENT FREQUENCY; (V) TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY; (VI) INCREASED VOLUME FROM OUR EXISTING SUPPLIERS; (VII) COMMODITY PRICING; (VIII) USED CAR PRICING; (IX) FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES; (X) PRODUCT MIX; (XI) CONTRACT MIX TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE; AND (XII) OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THESE FACTORS ARE FURTHER DISCUSSED IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND RISK FACTORS SECTIONS OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  POTENTIAL INTERNAL SOURCES OF ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL ARE THE SALE OF ASSETS OR THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES THROUGH OPTION EXERCISES AND SHARES ISSUED UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. A POTENTIAL EXTERNAL SOURCE OF ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL IS THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL DEBT WITH NEW LENDERS AND EQUITY. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT PREDICT IF THESE SOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE OR ON COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TERMS.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ACQUISITIONS AND NEW OPERATIONS  AS PART OF OUR OVERALL EXPANSION STRATEGY OF OFFERING INTEGRATED SERVICES TO VEHICLE SELLERS, WE ANTICIPATE ACQUIRING AND DEVELOPING FACILITIES IN NEW REGIONS, AS WELL AS THE REGIONS CURRENTLY SERVED BY OUR FACILITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ACQUISITIONS AND OPENINGS WILL STRENGTHEN OUR COVERAGE, AS WE HAVE FACILITIES LOCATED IN THE U.S., CANADA, THE U.K., BRAZIL, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, GERMANY, FINLAND, THE U.A.E., OMAN, BAHRAIN, AND SPAIN WITH THE INTENTION OF PROVIDING NATIONAL COVERAGE FOR OUR SELLERS.

IN ADDITION TO GROWTH THROUGH BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, WE SEEK TO INCREASE REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) ACQUIRING AND DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL VEHICLE STORAGE FACILITIES IN KEY MARKETS; (II) PURSUING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL VEHICLE SELLER AGREEMENTS; (III) INCREASING OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS; AND (IV) EXPANDING THE APPLICATION OF VB3 INTO NEW MARKETS. IN ADDITION, WE IMPLEMENT OUR PRICING STRUCTURE AND AUCTION PROCEDURES, AND ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE COST EFFICIENCIES AT EACH OF OUR ACQUIRED FACILITIES BY IMPLEMENTING OUR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES, INTEGRATING OUR MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND REDEPLOYING PERSONNEL, WHEN NECESSARY.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS CERTAIN DATA FROM OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL SERVICE REVENUES AND VEHICLE SALES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  .

THE  INCREASE  IN SERVICE REVENUES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  OF  $93.1 MILLION  , OR  23.6%  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR RESULTED FROM (I)  AN INCREASE  IN THE U.S. OF  $87.2 MILLION  AND (II)  AN INCREASE  IN INTERNATIONAL OF  $5.8 MILLION  . THE GROWTH IN THE U.S. WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY (I) INCREASED VOLUME AND (II) AN INCREASE IN REVENUE PER CAR DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE AUCTION SELLING PRICES, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE MIX OF VEHICLES SOLD. THE INCREASE IN VOLUME IN THE U.S. WAS DERIVED FROM (I) GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF UNITS SOLD FROM NEW AND EXPANDED CONTRACTS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, AND (II) GROWTH FROM EXISTING SUPPLIERS, DRIVEN BY WHAT WE BELIEVE WAS AN INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY. EXCLUDING THE DETRIMENTAL IMPACT OF $2.3 MILLION DUE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, PRIMARILY FROM THE CHANGE IN THE BRITISH POUND AND BRAZILIAN REAL TO U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATES, THE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL OF $8.1 MILLION WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED VOLUME AND HIGHER AVERAGE AUCTION SELLING PRICES.

THE  INCREASE  IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM DEPRECIATING CERTAIN CORPORATE AND TECHNOLOGY ASSETS IN THE U.S.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES TOTAL OTHER EXPENSE AND INCOME TAXES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  .

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO PAYMENTS FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED TAX WITHHOLDINGS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES NOT FULLY OFFSET BY CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED PRIMARILY FROM CERTAIN INCOME TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES AND TIMING OF CASH PAYMENTS. CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSISTED OF BANK DEPOSITS, DOMESTIC CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, AND FUNDS INVESTED IN MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS, WHICH BEAR INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES.  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR GROWTH THROUGH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF COMMON STOCK, EQUITY ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT FINANCING. OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS IS FROM THE COLLECTION OF SERVICE FEES AND REIMBURSABLE ADVANCES FROM THE PROCEEDS OF VEHICLE SALES. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO FINANCE OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND TO DEVELOP AND GROW OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION TO OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE ARE CONSIDERING A VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL USES FOR OUR REMAINING CASH BALANCES AND OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. THESE ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL USES INCLUDE ADDITIONAL STOCK REPURCHASES, REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT, THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AND ACQUISITIONS. FOR FURTHER DETAIL, SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  3 \u2013 LONG-TERM DEBT  AND  NOTE  9 \u2013 STOCK REPURCHASES  AND UNDER THE SUBHEADINGS \u201c  CREDIT AGREEMENT  \u201d AND \u201c  NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT  \u201d BELOW.  OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL AS INCLEMENT WEATHER DURING THE WINTER MONTHS INCREASES THE FREQUENCY OF ACCIDENTS AND CONSEQUENTLY, THE NUMBER OF CARS INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS WHICH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SALVAGE RATHER THAN REPAIR. DURING THE WINTER MONTHS, MOST OF OUR FACILITIES PROCESS 10% TO 30% MORE VEHICLES THAN AT OTHER TIMES OF THE YEAR. THIS INCREASED VOLUME REQUIRES THE INCREASED USE OF OUR CASH TO PAY OUT ADVANCES AND HANDLING COSTS OF THE ADDITIONAL BUSINESS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENTLY AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR OPERATING AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE EXPECT TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS AND EXPAND SOME OF OUR CURRENT FACILITIES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CASH THROUGH DRAWDOWNS ON OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY OR ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY TO FUND THIS EXPANSION. ALTHOUGH THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF GROWTH THROUGH EXPANSION AND ACQUISITIONS ARE NOT PREDICTABLE, THE OPENING OF NEW GREENFIELD YARDS IS CONTINGENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE PROPERTY THAT (I) IS IN AN AREA IN WHICH WE HAVE A NEED FOR MORE CAPACITY; (II) HAS ADEQUATE SIZE GIVEN THE CAPACITY NEEDS; (III) HAS THE APPROPRIATE SHAPE AND TOPOGRAPHY FOR OUR OPERATIONS; (IV) IS REASONABLY CLOSE TO A MAJOR ROAD OR HIGHWAY; AND (V) MOST IMPORTANTLY, HAS THE APPROPRIATE ZONING FOR OUR BUSINESS. COSTS TO DEVELOP A NEW YARD CAN RANGE FROM $3.0 TO $50.0 MILLION, DEPENDING ON SIZE, LOCATION AND DEVELOPMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS.  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  ,  $93.3 MILLION  OF THE  $181.1 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IF THESE FUNDS ARE NEEDED FOR OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., THE REPATRIATION OF THESE FUNDS COULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX FOLLOWING THE U.S. TAX REFORM. HOWEVER, OUR INTENT IS TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST THESE FUNDS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND OUR CURRENT PLANS DO NOT REQUIRE REPATRIATION TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONS.  NET CASH  PROVIDED BY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE TO IMPROVED CASH OPERATING RESULTS FROM AN INCREASE IN SERVICE REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN YARD OPERATIONS AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A AN INCREASE OF INCOME TAXES RECEIVABLE OF $44.0 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN FUNDS USED TO PAY ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $37.2 MILLION.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET CASH  USED IN  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO LEASE BUYOUTS OF CERTAIN FACILITIES, ACQUIRING LAND, OPENING AND IMPROVING FACILITIES, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR NEW SOFTWARE FOR INTERNAL USE AND MAJOR SOFTWARE ENHANCEMENTS, AND ACQUIRING YARD EQUIPMENT. WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP, EXPAND AND INVEST IN NEW AND EXISTING FACILITIES AND STANDARDIZE THE APPEARANCE OF EXISTING LOCATIONS.  NET CASH  USED IN  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO PAYMENTS FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK BASED TAX WITHHOLDINGS, AS DISCUSSED IN FURTHER DETAIL UNDER THE SUBHEADING \"  STOCK REPURCHASES  \" PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS.

THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSES OF THESE FINANCING TRANSACTIONS WERE TO INCREASE THE SIZE AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FINANCING. THE PROCEEDS ARE BEING USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, POTENTIAL SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS, OR OTHER INVESTMENTS RELATING TO OUR EXPANSION STRATEGIES IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , TOTAL SALES PER SQUARE FOOT WERE  $449.17  AND OUR INVENTORY TURNOVER RATIO WAS  5.0  TIMES.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 5.2 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR  $1.3 BILLION  THROUGH AN ASR AGREEMENT AND OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS.

SALES.  WE ASSESS OUR SALES PERFORMANCE BY EVALUATING BOTH NET SALES AND COMPARABLE SALES.  NET SALES  . NET SALES FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  3.5%  TO  $27.2 BILLION  FROM  $26.3 BILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE IN NET SALES IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE IMPACT OF POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET AND COMPARABLE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS. ONLINE SALES, WHICH CONSIST OF SALES GENERATED ONLINE THROUGH OUR WEBSITES FOR PRODUCTS PICKED UP IN OUR STORES OR DELIVERED TO CUSTOMER LOCATIONS, REPRESENTED  8.9%  OF NET SALES AND GREW  21.9%  DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . A STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SALES GROWTH BY  $41 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  COMPARABLE SALES  . COMPARABLE SALES IS A MEASURE THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR EXISTING LOCATIONS AND WEBSITES BY MEASURING THE CHANGE IN NET SALES FOR A PERIOD OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-PERIOD OF EQUIVALENT LENGTH. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDES SALES AT ALL LOCATIONS, PHYSICAL AND ONLINE, OPEN GREATER THAN 52 WEEKS (INCLUDING REMODELS AND RELOCATIONS) AND EXCLUDING CLOSED STORES. RETAIL STORES BECOME COMPARABLE ON THE MONDAY FOLLOWING THEIR 365  TH  DAY OF OPERATION. ACQUISITIONS, DIGITAL OR OTHERWISE, ARE INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE SALES AFTER WE OWN THE ACQUIRED ASSETS FOR MORE THAN 52 WEEKS. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDES NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERING SALES THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED FOR MORE THAN 52 WEEKS. COMPARABLE SALES EXCLUDES PRIOR-YEAR SALES OF PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS THAT WE HAVE EXITED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. FISCAL 2019 INCLUDES 52 WEEKS AND FISCAL 2018 INCLUDED 53  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WEEKS. FOR OUR CALCULATION OF COMPARABLE SALES IN FISCAL 2019, WE WILL COMPARE WEEKS 1 THROUGH 52 IN FISCAL 2019 AGAINST WEEKS 2 THROUGH 53 IN FISCAL 2018. COMPARABLE SALES IS INTENDED ONLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET SALES PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES  INCREASED  3.6%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , CONSISTING OF A  1.8%  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET AND A  1.8%  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS. THE  INCREASE  IN COMPARABLE SALES REFLECTED A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TRAFFIC GROWTH ACROSS A NUMBER OF OUR CORE CATEGORIES AND THE EXECUTION OF OUR STRATEGIC EFFORTS TO DRIVE AN ENHANCED INTERCONNECTED EXPERIENCE IN BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL WORLDS.  ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS POSTED POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  EXCEPT FOR  ELECTRICAL/LIGHTING AND LUMBER  . COMPARABLE SALES FOR OUR  APPLIANCES, INDOOR GARDEN, DE\u0301COR/STORAGE, HARDWARE, TOOLS, OUTDOOR GARDEN, PAINT, AND PLUMBING  MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS WERE ABOVE THE COMPANY AVERAGE IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . COMPARABLE SALES FOR ELECTRICAL/LIGHTING WERE SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE DUE TO THE LENGTHENING REPLACEMENT CYCLE OF LIGHT BULBS AND COPPER PRICE DEFLATION. COMPARABLE SALES FOR LUMBER WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY COMMODITY PRICE DEFLATION.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COMPARABLE SALES GROWTH AND TOTAL SALES GROWTH IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS DUE TO THE SHIFT IN OUR FISCAL CALENDAR AS A RESULT OF THE 53  RD  WEEK IN FISCAL 2018.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  INCREASED  2.6%  TO  $9.4 BILLION  FROM  $9.2 BILLION  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, OR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN, WAS  34.5%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  34.8%  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . THE  DECREASE  IN GROSS PROFIT MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SHRINK AND A CHANGE IN PRODUCT MIX.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE COMPOSED OF SG&A AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE  . SG&A FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  2.8%  TO  $4.9 BILLION  FROM  $4.8 BILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, SG&A WAS  18.2%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO  18.3%  FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, DRIVEN BY EXPENSE LEVERAGE RESULTING FROM POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES AND CONTINUED EXPENSE CONTROL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXPENSES RELATED TO STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  INCREASED  $25 MILLION  TO  $498 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  FROM  $473 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS  1.8%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND FISCAL  2018  , REFLECTING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS, LEVERAGE RESULTING FROM POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES, AND TIMING OF ASSET ADDITIONS.  INTEREST AND OTHER, NET.  INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, WAS  $280 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  $224 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . INTEREST AND OTHER, NET, AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS  1.0%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  AND  0.9%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  , WITH THE INCREASE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE RESULTING FROM HIGHER DEBT BALANCES.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  OUR COMBINED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS  24.5%  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  21.4%  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NONRECURRING TAX BENEFITS RELATING TO THE TAX ACT AND THE SETTLEMENT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE  $2.53  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  $2.51  FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FISCAL  2019  AND FISCAL  2018  NINE  MONTH COMPARISONS  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 3,  2019  OCTOBER 28,  2018  DOLLARS IN MILLIONS  $% OF  NET SALES  $% OF  NET SALES  NET SALES  $84,443  $81,712  GROSS PROFIT  28,836  34.1%  28,133  34.4%  OPERATING EXPENSES.

OUR COMPARABLE AVERAGE TICKET INCREASED  1.9%  FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , DUE IN PART TO BIG TICKET PURCHASES.  DURING THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS EXCEPT FOR LUMBER AND ELECTRICAL/LIGHTING POSTED POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES. COMPARABLE SALES FOR OUR  APPLIANCES, INDOOR GARDEN, DE\u0301COR/STORAGE, TOOLS, HARDWARE,  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUTDOOR GARDEN, PLUMBING, BUILDING MATERIALS, AND PAINT  MERCHANDISING DEPARTMENTS WERE ABOVE THE COMPANY AVERAGE FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  . COMPARABLE SALES FOR ELECTRICAL/LIGHTING WERE SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE DUE TO THE LENGTHENING REPLACEMENT CYCLE AND PRICE DEFLATION IN LIGHT BULBS.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  TO PROVIDE CLARITY, INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY, ABOUT OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WE SUPPLEMENT OUR REPORTING WITH CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. HOWEVER, THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED GAAP MEASURES. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED HEREIN MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILAR MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL.  WE BELIEVE ROIC IS MEANINGFUL FOR INVESTORS AND MANAGEMENT BECAUSE IT MEASURES HOW EFFECTIVELY WE DEPLOY OUR CAPITAL BASE. WE DEFINE ROIC AS NOPAT, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, FOR THE MOST RECENT TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD, DIVIDED BY AVERAGE DEBT AND EQUITY. WE DEFINE AVERAGE DEBT AND EQUITY AS THE AVERAGE OF BEGINNING AND ENDING LONG-TERM DEBT (INCLUDING CURRENT INSTALLMENTS) AND EQUITY FOR THE MOST RECENT TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE CALCULATION OF ROIC, TOGETHER WITH A RECONCILIATION OF NOPAT TO NET EARNINGS (THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE), FOLLOWS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  AT  NOVEMBER 3, 2019  , WE HAD  $2.2 BILLION  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, OF WHICH  $1.8 BILLION  WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH POSITION, ACCESS TO THE LONG-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, AND FUNDS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT NOT ONLY FOR OUR OPERATING REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO TO ENABLE US TO COMPLETE OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROGRAMS AND FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SHARE REPURCHASES, AND ANY REQUIRED LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS THROUGH THE NEXT SEVERAL FISCAL YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING.  AS WE CONTINUE OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS, WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY  $2.7 BILLION  IN FISCAL  2019.  DEBT AND DERIVATIVES  WE HAVE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION. ALL OF OUR SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  WERE UNDER THESE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS, AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME WAS  $2.1 BILLION  . IN CONNECTION WITH THESE PROGRAMS, WE HAVE BACK-UP CREDIT FACILITIES WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO $3.0 BILLION, WHICH CONSIST OF A FIVE-YEAR $2.0 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN DECEMBER 2022 AND A 364-DAY $1.0 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN DECEMBER 2019. AT  NOVEMBER 3, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITIES, AND NONE ARE EXPECTED TO IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES. AT  NOVEMBER 3, 2019  ,  $695 MILLION  WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS. WE ALSO ISSUE SENIOR NOTES FROM TIME TO TIME AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY.  WE USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INTEREST RATES ON CERTAIN LONG-TERM DEBT. SEE  NOTE 4  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR SENIOR NOTES ISSUANCES AND OUR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  SHARE REPURCHASES  IN FEBRUARY 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW $15.0 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT REPLACED THE PREVIOUS AUTHORIZATION. IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , WE HAD CASH PAYMENTS OF  $3.9 BILLION  FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK THROUGH ASR AGREEMENTS AND OPEN MARKET PURCHASES.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOWS SUMMARY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS PROVIDES US WITH A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS RESULT PRIMARILY FROM CASH RECEIVED FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, OFFSET BY CASH PAYMENTS WE MAKE FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, OPERATIONS, AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  CASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL. WORKING CAPITAL AT ANY POINT IN TIME IS SUBJECT TO MANY VARIABLES, INCLUDING SEASONALITY, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND CATEGORY EXPANSION, THE TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS, VENDOR PAYMENT TERMS, AND FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $628 MILLION  IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  AND WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FROM THE CONTINUATION OF OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN OUR BUSINESS OF  $1.9 BILLION  DURING THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  $1.7 BILLION  OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018.

RISK FACTORS\u201d AND \u201cPART II, ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d AND THOSE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN OUR OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (\"GAAP\").  THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.  THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS AFFECTING THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  ON A REGULAR BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO TOTAL COSTS ON LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION-TYPE CONTRACTS, COSTS TO BE INCURRED FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND EXTENDED MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS, BAD DEBTS, EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY, INCOME TAXES, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AND CONTINGENCIES.  OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.  ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  OVERVIEW  WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SELL A WIDE RANGE OF DISPLAY SYSTEMS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  WE FOCUS OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS ON MARKETS, GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS AND PRODUCTS.  OUR FIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS CONSIST OF FOUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS UNITS AND THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT.  THE FOUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS UNITS CONSIST OF COMMERCIAL, LIVE EVENTS, HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION, AND TRANSPORTATION, ALL OF WHICH INCLUDE THE GEOGRAPHIC TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.  DISCLOSURES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE PROVIDED IN \"  NOTE 5. SEGMENT REPORTING  \" OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.  OUR NET SALES AND PROFITABILITY HISTORICALLY HAVE FLUCTUATED DUE TO THE IMPACT OF UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS, SUCH AS DISPLAY SYSTEMS FOR PROFESSIONAL SPORTS FACILITIES, COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, AND SPECTACULAR PROJECTS IN THE COMMERCIAL AREA, AS WELL AS THE SEASONALITY OF THE SPORTS MARKET.  UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS CAN INCLUDE SEVERAL DISPLAYS, CONTROLLERS, AND SUBCONTRACTED STRUCTURE BUILDS, EACH OF WHICH CAN OCCUR ON VARIED SCHEDULES PER THE CUSTOMER'S NEEDS.  OUTDOOR INSTALLATION SALES CAN BE IMPACTED BY OUTDOOR WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE CONSTRUCTION SEASON.  OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER TENDS TO BE A SLOWER QUARTER BECAUSE IT INCLUDES TWO HOLIDAYS, IT IS AFFECTED BY SPORTS SEASONALITY, AND GENERALLY LESS OUTDOOR CONSTRUCTION WORK OCCURS DUE TO WEATHER CONDITIONS.  OUR GROSS MARGINS TEND TO FLUCTUATE MORE ON UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS THAN ON LIMITED CONFIGURED ORDERS.  UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS INVOLVING COMPETITIVE BIDDING AND SUBSTANTIAL SUBCONTRACT WORK FOR PRODUCT INSTALLATION GENERALLY HAVE LOWER GROSS MARGINS.  ALTHOUGH WE FOLLOW THE OVER TIME METHOD OF RECOGNIZING REVENUES FOR UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS, WE NEVERTHELESS HAVE EXPERIENCED FLUCTUATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS AND EXPECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR FLUCTUATIONS.  OUR REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS (\"BACKLOG\") CONSIST OF CONTRACTUALLY BINDING SALES AGREEMENTS OR PURCHASE ORDERS FOR INTEGRATED ELECTRONIC DISPLAY SYSTEMS AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICE.  ORDERS ARE INCLUDED IN BACKLOG WHEN WE ARE IN RECEIPT OF AN EXECUTED CONTRACT AND ANY REQUIRED DEPOSITS OR SECURITY.  AS A RESULT, CERTAIN ORDERS FOR WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED BINDING LETTERS OF INTENT OR CONTRACTS WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN BACKLOG UNTIL ALL REQUIRED CONTRACTUAL DOCUMENTS AND DEPOSITS ARE RECEIVED.  BACKLOG CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO LARGE ORDER BOOKINGS AND THE TIMING AND SEASONALITY OF NET SALES.  BECAUSE ORDER BACKLOG FLUCTUATES AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO EXTENDED DELIVERY SCHEDULES, ORDERS MAY BE CANCELED AND HAVE VARIED ESTIMATED PROFITABILITY.  OUR BACKLOG IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE NET SALES OR NET INCOME.  BACKLOG IS NOT A MEASURE DEFINED BY GAAP, AND OUR METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING BACKLOG MAY VARY FROM THE METHODOLOGY USED BY OTHER COMPANIES IN DETERMINING THEIR BACKLOG AMOUNTS.  GENERAL  OUR MISSION IS TO BE THE WORLD LEADER AT INFORMING AND ENTERTAINING AUDIENCES THROUGH DYNAMIC AUDIO-VISUAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS.  WE ORGANIZE INTO BUSINESS UNITS TO FOCUS ON CUSTOMER LOYALTY OVER TIME TO EARN NEW AND REPLACEMENT BUSINESS BECAUSE OUR PRODUCTS HAVE A FINITE LIFETIME.  SEE \"  NOTE 5. SEGMENT REPORTING  \" OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  OUR STRATEGIES INCLUDE THE CREATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE LINE OF INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS AND SYSTEMS AND OUR ABILITY TO CREATE AND LEVERAGE PLATFORM DESIGNS AND TECHNOLOGIES.  THESE STRATEGIES ALIGN US TO EFFECTIVELY DELIVER VALUE TO OUR VARIED CUSTOMERS AND THEIR MARKET NEEDS, WHILE SERVING OUR STAKEHOLDERS OVER THE LONG-TERM.  WE FOCUS ON CREATING LOCAL CAPABILITIES FOR SALES, SERVICE, AND MANUFACTURING IN GEOGRAPHIES WITH EXPECTED DIGITAL MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.  WE BELIEVE CONSISTENTLY GENERATING PROFITABLE GROWTH WILL PROVIDE VALUE TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS (CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, SHAREHOLDERS, SUPPLIERS, AND COMMUNITIES).  WE MEASURE OUR SUCCESS USING A VARIETY OF MEASURES INCLUDING.  \u2022  OUR PERCENTAGE OF MARKET SHARE BY COMPARING OUR ESTIMATED REVENUE TO THE TOTAL ESTIMATED GLOBAL DIGITAL DISPLAY REVENUE,  \u2022  OUR ORDER GROWTH COMPARED TO THE OVERALL DIGITAL MARKET ORDER CHANGE,  \u2022  FINANCIAL METRICS SUCH AS ANNUAL ORDER VOLUME AND PROFIT CHANGE AS COMPARED TO OUR PREVIOUS FINANCIAL RESULTS,  \u2022  CUSTOMER RETENTION AND EXPANSION RATES, AND  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE PROFITS OVER THE LONG-TERM TO PROVIDE A SHAREHOLDER RETURN.  CERTAIN FACTORS IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN THESE STRATEGIES AND IMPACT OUR BUSINESS UNITS TO VARYING DEGREES.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE OVERALL COST TO MANUFACTURE AND THE SELLING PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS HAVE DECREASED OVER THE YEARS AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO DECREASE IN THE FUTURE.  OUR COMPETITORS OUTSIDE THE U.S. ARE IMPACTED DIFFERENTLY BY THE GLOBAL TRADE ENVIRONMENT ALLOWING THEM TO AVOID TARIFF COSTS OR REDUCE PRICES.  AS A RESULT, ADDITIONAL COMPETITORS HAVE ENTERED THE MARKET, AND EACH YEAR WE MUST SELL MORE PRODUCT TO GENERATE THE SAME OR GREATER LEVEL OF NET SALES AS IN PREVIOUS FISCAL YEARS.  HOWEVER, THE DECLINE OF DIGITAL SOLUTION PRICING OVER THE YEARS AND INCREASED USER ADOPTION AND APPLICATIONS HAVE INCREASED THE SIZE OF THE GLOBAL MARKET.  COMPETITOR OFFERINGS, ACTIONS AND REACTIONS ALSO CAN VARY AND CHANGE OVER TIME OR IN CERTAIN CUSTOMER SITUATIONS.  PROJECTS WITH MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR REVENUE POTENTIAL ATTRACTS COMPETITION, AND COMPETITORS CAN USE MARKETING OR OTHER TACTICS TO WIN BUSINESS.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EACH OF OUR BUSINESS UNIT'S LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE CAN BE IMPACTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND TO DIFFERENT DEGREES.  THE EFFECTS OF AN ADVERSE ECONOMY ARE GENERALLY LESS SEVERE ON OUR SPORTS RELATED BUSINESS AS COMPARED TO OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, ALTHOUGH IN SEVERE ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, THE SPORTS BUSINESS CAN ALSO BE SERIOUSLY IMPACTED.  WE CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT-TERM EVENTS LIKE THE U.S. ADMINISTRATIVE TRADE ACTIONS IN 2018 OR A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE DISCLOSED IN \"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\" INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  APRIL 27, 2019.  THE OUTLOOK AND UNIQUE KEY GROWTH DRIVERS AND CHALLENGES BY OUR BUSINESS UNITS INCLUDE.  COMMERCIAL BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  STANDARD DISPLAY PRODUCT MARKET GROWTH DUE TO MARKET ADOPTION AND LOWER PRODUCT COSTS, WHICH DRIVE MARKETPLACE EXPANSION.  STANDARD DISPLAY PRODUCTS ARE USED TO ATTRACT OR COMMUNICATE WITH CUSTOMERS AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS OF RETAIL, COMMERCIAL, AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS.  PRICING AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS THAT IMPACT OUR SUCCESS IN THIS BUSINESS UNIT.  WE UTILIZE A RESELLER NETWORK TO DISTRIBUTE OUR STANDARD PRODUCTS.  \u2022  NATIONAL ACCOUNTS STANDARD DISPLAY MARKET OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO CUSTOMERS' DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE THEIR MESSAGE, ADVERTISING AND CONTENT CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  INCREASED DEMAND IS POSSIBLE FROM NATIONAL RETAILERS, QUICK SERVE RESTAURANTS, PETROLEUM RETAILERS, AND OTHER NATIONWIDE ORGANIZATIONS.  \u2022  ADDITIONAL STANDARD DISPLAY OFFERINGS USING MICRO-LIGHT EMITTING DIODE (\"LED\") DESIGNS.  \u2022  INCREASING USE OF LED TECHNOLOGIES REPLACING SIGNAGE PREVIOUSLY USING LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY (\"LCD\") TECHNOLOGY BY EXISTING AND NEW CUSTOMERS.  \u2022  INCREASING INTEREST IN SPECTACULARS, WHICH INCLUDE VERY LARGE AND SOMETIMES HIGHLY CUSTOMIZED DISPLAYS AS PART OF ENTERTAINMENT VENUES SUCH AS CASINOS, SHOPPING CENTERS, CRUISE SHIPS AND TIMES SQUARE TYPE LOCATIONS.  \u2022  DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS DEMAND GROWTH DUE TO MARKET ADOPTION AND EXPANDED USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY.  \u2022  THE USE OF ARCHITECTURAL LIGHTING PRODUCTS FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, WHICH REAL ESTATE OWNERS USE TO ADD ACCENTS OR EFFECTS TO AN ENTIRE SIDE OR CIRCUMFERENCE OF A BUILDING TO COMMUNICATE MESSAGES OR TO DECORATE THE BUILDING.  \u2022  THE CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF DIGITAL BILLBOARDS AS OUT-OF-HOME (\"OOH\") ADVERTISING COMPANIES CONTINUE DEVELOPING NEW SITES AND REPLACING DIGITAL BILLBOARDS REACHING END OF LIFE.  THIS IS DEPENDENT ON NO ADVERSE CHANGES OCCURRING IN THE DIGITAL BILLBOARD REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RESTRICTING FUTURE BILLBOARD DEPLOYMENTS, AS WELL AS MAINTAINING OUR CURRENT MARKET SHARE IN A BUSINESS THAT IS CONCENTRATED IN A FEW LARGE OOH COMPANIES.  \u2022  REPLACEMENT CYCLES WITHIN EACH OF THESE AREAS.  LIVE EVENTS BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE LIVE EVENTS BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  FACILITIES SPENDING MORE ON LARGER DISPLAY SYSTEMS TO ENHANCE THE GAME-DAY AND EVENT EXPERIENCE FOR ATTENDEES.  \u2022  LOWER PRODUCT COSTS, DRIVING AN EXPANSION OF THE MARKETPLACE.  \u2022  OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL MICRO-LED OFFERINGS WHICH REMAIN THE MOST INTEGRATED AND COMPREHENSIVE OFFERINGS IN THE INDUSTRY.  \u2022  THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF SPORTS TEAMS, WHICH STRIVE TO OUT-PERFORM THEIR COMPETITORS WITH DISPLAY SYSTEMS.  \u2022  THE DESIRE FOR HIGH-DEFINITION VIDEO DISPLAYS, WHICH TYPICALLY DRIVES LARGER DISPLAYS OR HIGHER RESOLUTION DISPLAYS, BOTH OF WHICH INCREASE THE AVERAGE TRANSACTION SIZE.  \u2022  DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEM NEEDS THROUGHOUT A SPORTS FACILITY.  \u2022  INCREASING USE OF LED TECHNOLOGIES REPLACING SIGNAGE PREVIOUSLY USING LCD TECHNOLOGY IN AND SURROUNDING LIVE EVENTS FACILITIES.  \u2022  REPLACEMENT CYCLES WITHIN EACH OF THESE AREAS.  HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  INCREASED DEMAND FOR VIDEO SYSTEMS IN HIGH SCHOOLS AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS REALIZE THE REVENUE GENERATING POTENTIAL OF THESE DISPLAYS COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL SCOREBOARDS AND THESE SYSTEMS' ABILITY TO PROVIDE OR ENHANCE ACADEMIC CURRICULUM OFFERINGS FOR STUDENTS.  \u2022  INCREASED DEMAND FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISPLAYS AND DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS, SUCH AS MESSAGE CENTERS AT SCHOOLS TO COMMUNICATE TO STUDENTS, PARENTS AND THE BROADER COMMUNITY.  \u2022  LOWER SYSTEM COSTS DRIVING THE USE OF MORE SOPHISTICATED DISPLAYS IN SCHOOL ATHLETIC FACILITIES, SUCH AS LARGE INTEGRATED VIDEO SYSTEMS.  \u2022  EXPANDING CONTROL SYSTEM OPTIONS TAILORED FOR THE MARKETS' NEEDS.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM INCREASING APPLICATIONS AND ACCEPTANCE OF ELECTRONIC DISPLAYS TO MANAGE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, INCLUDING ROADWAY, AIRPORT, PARKING, TRANSIT AND OTHER APPLICATIONS.  EFFECTIVE USE OF THE UNITED STATES TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRES INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS.  THIS GROWTH IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT SPENDING, PRIMARILY BY STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS, ALONG WITH THE CONTINUING ACCEPTANCE OF PRIVATE/PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS AS AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE.  GROWTH IS ALSO EXPECTED IN DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS FOR ADVERTISING AND WAY-FINDING USE IN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND AIRPORT TERMINALS DUE TO EXPANDED MARKET USAGE AND DISPLAYS, WITH LED TECHNOLOGY REPLACING PRIOR LCD INSTALLATIONS AND ADDITIONAL DISPLAY OFFERINGS USING MICRO-LEDS.  INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM ACHIEVING GREATER PENETRATION IN VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIES AND BUILDING PRODUCTS MORE SUITED TO INDIVIDUAL MARKETS.  WE CONTINUE TO BROADEN OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS INTO THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT IN EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST.  WE ALSO FOCUS ON SPORTS FACILITY, SPECTACULAR-TYPE, OOH ADVERTISING PRODUCTS, AND ARCHITECTURAL LIGHTING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND THE FACTORS LISTED IN EACH OF THE OTHER BUSINESS UNITS TO THE EXTENT THEY APPLY OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.  ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES EXIST WITH EXPANDED MARKET USAGE OF LED TECHNOLOGY DUE TO PRICE CONSIDERATIONS, USAGE OF LED TECHNOLOGY REPLACING PRIOR LCD INSTALLATIONS AND ADDITIONAL DISPLAY OFFERINGS USING MICRO-LEDS.

THE  DECREASE  IN NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD ONE YEAR AGO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF LARGE CUSTOM PROJECTS IN THE SPECTACULAR NICHE AND LIGHTER DEMAND IN THE ON-PREMISE NICHE, WHILE THE OOH NICHE REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE  DECREASE  IN ORDERS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD ONE YEAR AGO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SOFTER MARKET IN THE ON-PREMISE AND OOH NICHES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LARGE ORDERS IN THE SPECTACULAR NICHE.  LIVE EVENTS.  THE  INCREASE  IN NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD ONE YEAR AGO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF THE DEMAND FOR UPGRADED OR NEW SOLUTIONS FOR ARENAS AND PROFESSIONAL SPORTS STADIUMS.

THE  DECREASE  IN OUR GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD ONE YEAR AGO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN TARIFF RELATED EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 MILLION, OR A 0.6% IMPACT TO GROSS PROFIT, AS LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME TARIFFS WERE JUST BEING INTRODUCED ON US IMPORTS OF ALUMINUM, STEEL, AND COMPONENTS FROM CHINA.  WE ALSO EXPERIENCED ADDITIONAL EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $3.0 MILLION FOR PROJECT DELIVERY COSTS AND FOR AN EXISTING LITIGATION CLAIM ESTIMATE.  TOTAL WARRANTY AS A PERCENT OF SALES DECREASED TO 2.2% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  AS COMPARED TO 2.5% DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 27, 2018  .  THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES THE OVERALL IMPACT BY BUSINESS UNIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD ONE YEAR AGO.  THE GROSS PROFIT PERCENT DECREASED IN OUR COMMERCIAL, LIVE EVENTS, AND HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION BUSINESS UNITS FOR THE REASONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

ON NOVEMBER 15, 2016, WE ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED LOAN AGREEMENT AND A RELATED REVOLVING NOTE AND CONTINUING AND UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTY AGREEMENT WITH ANOTHER BANK WHICH SUPPORTED OUR CREDIT NEEDS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.  THE REVOLVING AMOUNT OF THE LOAN WAS $20.0 MILLION, WITH A MATURITY DATE OF NOVEMBER 15, 2019.  AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , THERE WERE NO ADVANCES OUTSTANDING UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT.  WE DID NOT RENEW THIS AGREEMENT.  THEREFORE, THE LOAN AGREEMENT AND RELATED REVOLVING NOTE AND GUARANTY EXPIRED AND TERMINATED ACCORDING TO THEIR TERMS ON NOVEMBER 15, 2019, AND WE HAVE NO CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITY UNDER THIS LOAN AGREEMENT, REVOLVING NOTE, AND GUARANTY.  WE ARE SOMETIMES REQUIRED TO OBTAIN BANK GUARANTEES OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR DISPLAY INSTALLATIONS AND WE HAVE A GLOBAL BANKING RELATIONSHIP TO PROVIDE SUCH INSTRUMENTS.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET THE TERMS OF THE ARRANGEMENT, OUR CUSTOMER WOULD DRAW ON THE BANKING ARRANGEMENT, AND THE BANK WOULD SUBROGATE ITS LOSS TO DAKTRONICS.  AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , WE HAD  $5.6 MILLION  OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS OUTSTANDING.  WE ARE SOMETIMES REQUIRED TO OBTAIN PERFORMANCE BONDS FOR DISPLAY INSTALLATIONS, AND WE HAVE A BONDING LINE AVAILABLE THROUGH A SURETY COMPANY FOR AN AGGREGATE OF $150.0 MILLION IN BONDED WORK OUTSTANDING.  IF WE WERE UNABLE TO COMPLETE THE WORK, AND OUR CUSTOMER WOULD CALL UPON THE BOND FOR PAYMENT, THE SURETY COMPANY WOULD SUBROGATE ITS LOSS TO DAKTRONICS.  AT  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , WE HAD  $8.4 MILLION  OF BONDED WORK OUTSTANDING AGAINST THIS LINE.  OUR BUSINESS GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES DEPEND ON INVESTMENTS IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS.  WE ARE PROJECTING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE LESS THAN $25 MILLION FOR  FISCAL 2020  FOR PURCHASES OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT FOR NEW OR ENHANCED PRODUCT PRODUCTION, EXPANDED CAPACITY, INVESTMENTS IN QUALITY AND RELIABILITY EQUIPMENT, AND CONTINUED INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS.  WE ALSO EVALUATE AND MAY INVEST IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR ACQUIRE COMPANIES ALIGNED WITH OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY.  WE BELIEVE OUR WORKING CAPITAL AVAILABLE FROM ALL SOURCES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET THE CASH REQUIREMENTS OF OUR OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  IF OUR GROWTH EXTENDS BEYOND CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, OR IF WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS, WE MAY NEED TO UTILIZE AND POSSIBLY INCREASE OUR CREDIT FACILITIES OR SEEK OTHER MEANS OF FINANCING.  WE ANTICIPATE WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ANY NEEDED FUNDS UNDER COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS FROM OUR CURRENT LENDERS OR OTHER SOURCES, ALTHOUGH THIS AVAILABILITY CANNOT BE GUARANTEED.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE HAS BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS SINCE THE END OF OUR  2019  FISCAL YEAR ON  APRIL 27, 2019  .
