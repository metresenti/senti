THE INCREASE IN NET LOSS WAS PRIMARILY FROM THE RESULT OF APPROXIMATELY $538,000 INCREASE IN NET LOSS FROM OPERATIONS DUE PRIMARILY TO A $236,000 DECREASE IN REVENUES AND HIGHER LABOR AND HIGHER LEGAL EXPENSES IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES.

OCCUPANCY AND OTHER EXPENSE DECREASED APPROXIMATELY $33,000 IN THE 16-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MAY 20, 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE OF $236,000 IN REVENUES IN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2019.

THE COMPANY HAS NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS OF $0 ON MAY 20, 2019 AND JANUARY 28, 2019. THE COMPANY HAS A NET OPERATING LOSS FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. THE COMPANY HAS FULL VALUATION AGAINST ITS EXISTING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AS OF MAY 20, 2019.  15  IMPACT OF INFLATION  THE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON FOOD, LABOR, EQUIPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION AND REMODELING OF RESTAURANTS COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S MARGINS. MANY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EMPLOYEES ARE PAID HOURLY RATES RELATED TO STATE MINIMUM WAGE LAWS  THAT ARE TIED TO INFLATION INDEXES SO THAT CHANGES IN THESE LAWS WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER LABOR COSTS TO THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, FOOD ITEMS PURCHASED BY THE COMPANY ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND PRESSURES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT MODEST INCREASES IN THESE COSTS CAN BE OFFSET THROUGH PRICE CHANGES AND OTHER COST CONTROL EFFORTS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WOULD BE ABLE TO PASS SIGNIFICANT COSTS ON TO ITS CUSTOMERS IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS FINANCED OPERATIONS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CASH ON HAND, CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATIONS AND LOANS FROM OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS.  AS OF MAY 20, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD $115,000 IN CASH.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED BY $48,000 DURING THE 16-WEEKS ENDED MAY 20, 2019. THE NET WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT WAS $5.4 MILLION AND $4.4 MILLION AT MAY 20, 2019 AND JANUARY 28, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO GROW OUR BUSINESS AND ANTICIPATE RAISING SUCH CAPITAL THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK OR DEBT. WE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN BORROWING REQUIRED CAPITAL TO GROW OUR BUSINESS FROM OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS. WE HAVE NO COMMITMENT FROM THEM TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL VOLUNTARILY CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CAPITAL AS NEEDED. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AS NEEDED, AND WE WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED TO PAY A HIGH PRICE FOR CAPITAL.  THE COMPANY GENERATES CASH FLOW DAILY FROM SALES IN ITS RESTAURANTS AND MANAGES ITS CASH BALANCES TO MEET ITS CURRENT OPERATING OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $69,000 ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE 16-WEEKS ENDING MAY 20, 2019, PRIMARILY ON EXISTING RESTAURANTS.  CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATIONS WAS APPROXIMATELY $29,000 FOR THE 16-WEEKS ENDING MAY 20, 2019 AND $514,000 FOR THE 16-WEEKS ENDING MAY 21, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE 16-WEEK PERIOD ENDING MAY 20, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE NET LOSS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $8,000 FOR THE 16-WEEKS ENDING MAY 20, 2019 COMPARED TO CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $350,000 FOR THE 16-WEEKS ENDING MAY 21, 2018. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS AS FOLLOWS: THE COMPANY MADE NET DEBT PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $67,000 AND HAD CHECKS WRITTEN IN EXCESS OF BANK BALANCE OF $59,000, A CHANGE OF $59,000.

THE MATURITY DATES OF THE OBLIGATIONS RANGE FROM NOVEMBER 2019 TO OCTOBER 2035.  DURING FISCAL 2008, THE COMPANY BORROWED APPROXIMATELY $1,400,000 FROM MR.  WHEATON.  IN JUNE 2008, THE COMPANY BORROWED AN ADDITIONAL $592,000 FROM MR. WHEATON UNDER THE SAME TERMS. THIS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE NOTE BALANCE FROM $1,400,000 TO $1,992,000, THE BALANCE AS OF MAY 20, 2019 AND JANUARY 28, 2019. THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE AND ANY UNPAID INTEREST WAS DUE AND PAYABLE IN FULL ON JUNE 5, 2012. THE LOAN WAS SUBSEQUENTLY MODIFIED AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BANKRUPTCY FILING AND PURSUANT TO THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION APPROVED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ON DECEMBER 17, 2012 (THE \u201cBANKRUPTCY PLAN\u201d), THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE WAS NOT ELIGIBLE TO BE REPAID UNTIL ALL OBLIGATIONS OWED TO OTHER CREDITORS HAVE BEEN FULLY SATISFIED. INTEREST ACCRUED ON THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $1,992,000 AND THE INTEREST OF $197,000 FROM SEPTEMBER 28, 2011 TO DECEMBER 7, 2016 AT THE BANKRUPTCY PLAN RATE. WHEN THE BANKRUPTCY COURT ENTERED INTO A FINAL DECREE AND ORDER CLOSING THE BANKRUPTCY CASE OF STAR BUFFET, INC. ON DECEMBER 7, 2016 THE COMPANY REVERTED BACK TO THE ORIGINAL INTEREST RATE OF 8.5%. THE COMPANY EXPENSED $60,000 TO ROBERT E. WHEATON FOR INTEREST DURING THE FIRST QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019.  16  ON NOVEMBER 9, 2016, THE COMPANY BORROWED $450,000 FROM MR. ROBERT E. WHEATON TO REMODEL THE 4B\u2019 RESTAURANT IN MISSOULA, MONTANA. THE THREE-YEAR FULLY AMORTIZED SECURED LOAN HAS MONTHLY PAYMENTS OF $14,839 AND INTEREST RATE OF 11.5%. THE COMPANY PAID MR. WHEATON APPROXIMATELY $55,000 AND $51,000 IN PRINCIPAL DURING THE FIRST QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019, RESPECTIVELY, UNDER THIS MORTGAGE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PAID APPROXIMATELY $5,000 AND $8,000 IN INTEREST DURING THE FIRST QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND JUDGMENTS  THE COMPANY PREPARES ITS CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH US GAAP. THE COMPANY'S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICIES, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1\u2014SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FISCAL 2019 INCLUDED IN THE 2019 FORM 10-K. CERTAIN OF THESE POLICIES REQUIRE NUMEROUS ESTIMATES AND STRATEGIC OR ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY PROVE INACCURATE OR BE SUBJECT TO VARIATIONS AND WHICH MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION FOR THE REPORTED PERIOD OR IN FUTURE PERIODS. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING FACTORS, ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATES IN ANY OF THESE AREAS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  EARNINGS OR LOSS PER COMMON SHARE  NET (LOSS) INCOME PER COMMON SHARE - BASIC IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. NET (LOSS) INCOME PER COMMON SHARE \u2013 DILUTED IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD PLUS THE EFFECT OF DILUTIVE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENTS OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENTS AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE DILUTED CALCULATION USING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD.  BASIC EARNINGS OR LOSS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED ON THE BASIS OF THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIODS. DILUTED EARNINGS OR LOSS PER COMMON SHARE IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD PLUS THE EFFECT OF DILUTIVE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENTS OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTIVE STOCK OPTIONS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENTS AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE DILUTED CALCULATION USING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS FOR THE FISCAL QUARTERS ENDING MAY 20, 2019 AND MAY 21, 2018.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  THE COMPANY EVALUATES IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 360, \u201cPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\u201d.  THE COMPANY ASSESSES WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWN IS NECESSARY WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED IS MEASURED BY A COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSET.  IF SUCH ASSET IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. ANY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED AS A CHARGE TO EARNINGS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS IN THE AFFECTED PERIOD.  JUDGMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY RELATED TO THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO REALIZE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF SUCH ASSETS ARE AFFECTED BY FACTORS SUCH AS THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS OF THE ASSETS, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND CHANGES IN OPERATING PERFORMANCE. AS THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE ONGOING EXPECTED NET CASH FLOWS AND CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, THESE FACTORS COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY TO REALIZE A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD.  17  BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT  BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT ARE CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ARE PROVIDED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE FOLLOWING USEFUL LIVES.  YEARS  BUILDING  40  LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS  15  -  20  (1)  FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT  5  -  8  (1)  LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE LESSER OF THE LIFE OF THE LEASE OR THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE ASSETS. THE LIFE OF THE LEASE INCLUDES RENEWAL OPTIONS DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT AT LEASE INCEPTION AS REASONABLY LIKELY TO BE EXERCISED. IF A PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED LEASE OPTION IS NOT EXERCISED, ANY REMAINING UNAMORTIZED LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE EXPENSED IMMEDIATELY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO OPERATING RESULTS IN THAT PERIOD.  EQUIPMENT IN NON-OPERATING UNITS OR STORED IN WAREHOUSES, WHICH IS HELD FOR REMODELING OR REPOSITIONING, IS DEPRECIATED AND IS RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS PROPERTY, BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT HELD FOR FUTURE USE.  BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT PLACED ON THE MARKET FOR SALE IS NOT DEPRECIATED AND IS RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS PROPERTY HELD FOR SALE AND RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.  REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AS INCURRED. MAJOR EQUIPMENT REFURBISHMENTS AND REMODELING COSTS ARE GENERALLY CAPITALIZED.  THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES REGARDING BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT INCLUDE CERTAIN MANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF SUCH ASSETS, THE RESIDUAL VALUES TO WHICH THE ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED AND THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT CONSTITUTES THE LIFE OF EXISTING ASSETS. THESE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES MAY PRODUCE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE THAN WOULD BE REPORTED IF DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED.  INCOME TAXES  OUR CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS BASED ON OUR ESTIMATED TAXABLE INCOME IN EACH OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AFTER CONSIDERING THE IMPACT ON OUR TAXABLE INCOME OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULTING FROM DISPARATE TREATMENT OF ITEMS, SUCH AS DEPRECIATION, ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLOSED RESTAURANTS, ESTIMATED LIABILITIES FOR SELF-INSURANCE, TAX CREDITS AND NET OPERATING LOSSES (\u201cNOL\u201d) FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED FOR THE ESTIMATED FUTURE INCOME TAX EFFECT OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE ALSO PROVIDED FOR NOL AND INCOME TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS IS ESTABLISHED WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT REALIZE SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE TAX BENEFIT OF OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS. WE EVALUATE, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS ARE REALIZABLE BASED UPON RECENT PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, TAX REPORTING POSITIONS, AND EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. THE DETERMINATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS SUBJECT TO ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO DETERMINE IF OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES SHOULD CHANGE.  CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY HAS A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSET, NET OF EXPECTED REVERSALS OF EXISTING DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES.  ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  IN NOVEMBER 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) 2018-18 \u2013  COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS  (TOPIC 808), WHICH CLARIFIES THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TOPIC 808 AND TOPIC 606, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE PROVISIONS OF ASU 2018-18 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO ADOPT THIS STANDARD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2021. THIS STANDARD IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.  18  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES UPDATE  ADOPTION OF ASC TOPIC 842: LEASES  THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2016-02-  LEASES  (TOPIC 842) AND RELATED AMENDMENTS, AS OF JANUARY 29, 2019, USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH. THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH PROVIDES A METHOD FOR RECORDING EXISTING LEASES AT ADOPTION WITH A CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS. THE COMPANY ELECTED THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS WHICH PERMITS THE COMPANY TO NOT REASSESS (1) WHETHER ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE OR CONTAIN LEASES, (2) THE LEASE CLASSIFICATION FOR ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING LEASES, AND (3) ANY INITIAL DIRECT COSTS FOR ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING LEASES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE. THE COMPANY ALSO ELECTED THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT LEASE CONSIDERATIONS TO NOT ALLOCATE LEASE CONSIDERATIONS BETWEEN LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS FOR REAL ESTATE LEASES. AS SUCH, REAL ESTATE LEASE CONSIDERATIONS ARE TREATED AS A SINGLE LEASE-COMPONENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR ACCORDINGLY.  THE COMPANY APPLIED A PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO EFFECTIVELY ACCOUNT FOR THE OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES AND OPERATING LEASE ASSETS; THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE FINANCING LEASES. THE COMPANY EXCLUDES LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE APPLICATION OF TOPIC 842.  ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD RESULTED IN THE RECORDING OF OPERATING LEASE ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES OF $14.4 MILLION AND $15.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF JANUARY 29, 2019. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE APPROXIMATE VALUE OF THE OPERATING LEASE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO DEFERRED RENT, DEFERRED RENT INCENTIVES, LEASEHOLD INTERESTS AND PREPAID RENT. THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE BEGINNING ACCUMULATED DEFICIT WAS $(501,000) DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842. THERE WAS NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS OR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS CASH FLOWS. THE COMPANY\u2019S COMPARATIVE PERIODS CONTINUE TO BE PRESENTED AND DISCLOSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH LEGACY GUIDANCE IN TOPIC 840.  OPERATING LEASES  THE COMPANY DETERMINES IF AN ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. LEASE AGREEMENTS WILL TYPICALLY EXIST WITH LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY.  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES EQUAL TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE LEASE PAYMENTS AND OPERATING LEASE ASSETS REPRESENTING THE RIGHT TO USE THE UNDERLYING ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM. THE LEASE EXPENSE FOR LEASE PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  AS THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASES DO NOT PROVIDE AN IMPLICIT RATE, THE COMPANY WILL USE A SECURED INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT LEASE COMMENCEMENT IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS. THE OPERATING LEASE ASSETS INCLUDE ANY LEASE PAYMENTS MADE PRIOR TO LEASE COMMENCEMENT AND ARE REDUCED BY ANY LEASE INCENTIVES.  UNDER TOPIC 842, FOR ANY NEW LEASES ENTERED INTO, THE COMPANY WILL ASSESS IF IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE LEASE OPTIONS TO EXTEND OR TERMINATE THE LEASE FOR INCLUSION (OR EXCLUSION) IN THE LEASE TERM WHEN THE COMPANY MEASURES THE LEASE LIABILITY. THE DEPRECIABLE LIFE OF ANY ASSETS AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS ARE LIMITED BY THE EXPECTED LEASE TERM.  CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING LEASES INCLUDE VARIABLE RENTAL PAYMENTS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF SALES OVER CONTRACTUAL LEVELS. VARIABLE RENTAL PAYMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE OBLIGATION FOR THOSE PAYMENTS IS INCURRED. IF SUCH VARIABLE OPERATING LEASES ARISE THAT INCLUDE INCENTIVES FROM LANDLORDS IN THE FORM OF CASH, THE COMPANY WILL RECORD THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE INCENTIVE WHEN SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ARE MET AS A DEFERRED LIABILITY. THE DEFERRED LIABILITY IS AMORTIZED INTO INCOME AS A REDUCTION OF RENT EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE APPLICABLE LEASE, INCLUDING OPTIONS TO EXTEND IF THEY ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO BE EXERCISED. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED THOSE LIABILITIES TO BE AMORTIZED WITHIN A YEAR AS A CURRENT LIABILITY AND THOSE GREATER THAN A YEAR AS A LONG-TERM LIABILITY. FOR PURPOSES OF RECOGNIZING THESE INCENTIVES AND RENTAL EXPENSES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, THE COMPANY USES THE DATE IT OBTAINS THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE AND CONTROL THE LEASE ASSET TO BEGIN AMORTIZATION, WHICH IS GENERALLY WHEN THE COMPANY TAKES POSSESSION OF THE ASSET. PLEASE REFER TO NOTE 5 \u2013 OPERATING LEASES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES RELATED TO LEASES.

WE REFER TO THE LAUNDRY LOCATIONS OF THE U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING REPORTING SEGMENT AS \u201cINDUSTRIAL LAUNDRIES\u201d OR \u201cINDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY LOCATIONS\u201d, AND TO THE U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING, MFG, AND CORPOR  ATE REPORTING SEGMENTS COMBINED AS OUR \u201cCORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS.\u201d  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). AS SUCH, MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

GENERAL  WE DERIVE OUR REVENUES THROUGH THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, PERSONALIZATION, RENTAL, CLEANING, DELIVERING, AND SELLING OF A WIDE RANGE OF UNIFORMS AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING, INCLUDING SHIRTS, PANTS, JACKETS, COVERALLS, LAB COATS, SMOCKS AND APRONS AND SPECIALIZED PROTECTIVE WEAR, SUCH AS FLAME RESISTANT AND HIGH VISIBILITY GARMENTS. WE ALSO RENT INDUSTRIAL WIPING PRODUCTS, FLOOR MATS, FACILITY SERVICE PRODUCTS, OTHER NON-GARMENT ITEMS, AND PROVIDE RESTROOM AND CLEANING SUPPLIES AND FIRST AID CABINET SERVICES AND OTHER SAFETY SUPPLIES, TO A VARIETY OF MANUFACTURERS, RETAILERS AND SERVICE COMPANIES. WE HAVE FIVE REPORTING SEGMENTS, U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING, MFG, SPECIALTY GARMENTS, FIRST AID AND CORPORATE. WE REFER TO THE U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING, MFG, AND CORPORATE REPORTING SEGMENTS COMBINED AS OUR \u201cCORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS.\u201d  COST OF REVENUES INCLUDE THE AMORTIZATION OF RENTAL MERCHANDISE IN SERVICE AND MERCHANDISE COSTS RELATED TO DIRECT SALES AS WELL AS LABOR AND OTHER PRODUCTION, SERVICE AND DELIVERY COSTS, AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING OUR CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS, SPECIALTY GARMENTS FACILITIES, AND FIRST AID LOCATIONS. SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCLUDE COSTS RELATED TO OUR SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CORPORATE OFFICES, NON-OPERATING ENVIRONMENTAL SITES AND OPERATING LOCATIONS INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ENGINEERING, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT, MANUFACTURING PLANNING, FINANCE, BUDGETING, AND HUMAN RESOURCES.  WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PLANTS AND CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IN ENERGY PRODUCING REGIONS IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. IN GENERAL, WE ARE RELATIVELY MORE DEPENDENT ON BUSINESS IN THESE REGIONS THAN ARE MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DRAMATIC DECREASE IN OIL PRICES BEGINNING IN 2014 DIRECTLY AFFECTED OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY AS THEY CURTAILED THEIR LEVEL OF OPERATIONS, WHICH ALSO HAD A CORRESPONDING EFFECT ON OUR CUSTOMERS IN BUSINESSES WHICH SERVICE OR SUPPLY THE OIL INDUSTRY AS WELL AS OUR CUSTOMERS IN UNRELATED BUSINESSES LOCATED IN AREAS WHICH HAD BENEFITED FROM THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION GENERATED BY THE ROBUST GROWTH DRIVEN BY THE HIGHER OIL PRICES IN PRIOR YEARS. AS A RESULT, OUR ORGANIC GROWTH IN PERIODS FOLLOWING THIS DRAMATIC DECREASE IN OIL PRICES WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ELEVATED HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS IN OUR WEARER BASE AS WELL AS INCREASED LOST ACCOUNTS. RECENT TRENDS INDICATE THAT INCREASED ENERGY PRICES HAVE RESULTED IN STABILIZED OR IMPROVED WEARER LEVELS AT EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN OUR NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY-DEPENDENT MARKETS. OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE ALSO DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE COSTS OF THE GASOLINE USED TO FUEL OUR VEHICLES AND THE NATURAL GAS USED TO OPERATE OUR PLANTS. WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN ENERGY PRICES, IN GENERAL, WE BELIEVE THAT SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES WOULD HAVE AN OVERALL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS DUE TO CUTBACKS BY OUR CUSTOMERS BOTH IN, AND DEPENDENT UPON, THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRIES, WHICH WOULD OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS IN OUR OPERATING COSTS FROM LOWER ENERGY COSTS.  27  THE COST OF HEALTHCARE THAT WE PROVIDE TO OUR EMPLOYEES HAS GROWN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AT A RATE IN EXCESS OF OUR REVENUE GROWTH AND AS A RESULT, HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR OPERATING RESULTS. MOREOVER, IT IS GENERALLY EXPECTED THAT HEALTHCARE COSTS IN  THE UNITED STATES WILL INCREASE OVER THE COMING YEARS AT RATES IN EXCESS OF INFLATION. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, AND DEPENDING ON THE EFFECT OF ANY MODIFICATIONS WE HAVE MADE, AND MAY MAKE IN THE FUTURE, TO OUR EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE PLANS AND ENROLLMENT  LEVELS IN THOSE PLANS, WE EXPECT THAT OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE FURTHER ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY INCREASING HEALTHCARE COSTS.  OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS, INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENTS, OVERTIME REQUIREMENTS, WORKING CONDITION REQUIREMENTS, CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENTS, HEALTHCARE INSURANCE MANDATES AND OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IMPACT OUR LABOR COSTS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR LABOR COSTS WILL RISE DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019 AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN STATE AND LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE LEVELS AS WELL AS THE OVERALL IMPACT OF WAGE PRESSURE AS THE RESULT OF A LOW UNEMPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT.  ON JANUARY 2, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZING US TO REPURCHASE FROM TIME TO TIME UP TO $100.0 MILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. REPURCHASES MADE UNDER THE PROGRAM, IF ANY, WILL BE MADE IN EITHER THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE TIMING, MANNER, PRICE AND AMOUNT OF ANY REPURCHASES WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR STOCK PRICE, CORPORATE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND PRIORITIES, APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL BE FUNDED USING OUR AVAILABLE CASH OR CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.  DURING THE THIRTEEN AND THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED MAY 25, 2019, WE REPURCHASED 99,500 AND 144,500 SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, FOR AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF $147.47 AND $145.01, RESPECTIVELY.  DURING FISCAL 2017, WE RECORDED A PRE-TAX NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $55.8 MILLION ONCE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED WOULD BE COMPLETED AND PLACED INTO SERVICE. ON DECEMBER 28, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR LEAD CONTRACTOR FOR THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO WHICH WE RECORDED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019 A TOTAL GAIN OF $21.1 MILLION AS A REDUCTION OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDES OUR RECEIPT OF A ONE-TIME CASH PAYMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $13.0 MILLION AS WELL AS THE FORGIVENESS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY DUE THE CONTRACTOR. WE ALSO RECEIVED HARDWARE AND RELATED MAINTENANCE SERVICE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $0.8 MILLION AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT.  IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER OF 2018, WE INITIATED A MULTIYEAR CRM PROJECT TO FURTHER DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND DEPLOY A THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION WE LICENSED. THIS NEW SOLUTION IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, CAPABILITY AND INFORMATION FLOW AS WELL AS INCREASE AUTOMATION IN SERVICING OUR CUSTOMERS. AS OF MAY 25, 2019, WE HAVE CAPITALIZED $7.9 MILLION RELATED TO OUR NEW CRM PROJECT.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cACT\u201d) WAS ENACTED, WHICH, AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS, REDUCED THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 FROM A 35.0% RATE TO A NEW 21.0% CORPORATE RATE AND IMPOSED A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON EARNINGS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED ITS ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE ACT (SEE NOTE 13, \u201cINCOME TAXES\u201d TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q).  A PORTION OF OUR SALES IS DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, INCLUDING CANADA. REVENUES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 7.9% AND 7.8% OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FOR THE THIRTEEN AND THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED MAY 25, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. REVENUES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 8.3% AND 8.1% OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FOR THE THIRTEEN AND THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED MAY 26, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AND SUCH RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. IN ADDITION, FLUCTUATIONS IN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE MARGINS OF OUR CANADIAN BUSINESS BECAUSE A WEAKER CANADIAN DOLLAR WILL INCREASE THE COST OF MERCHANDISE AND OTHER OPERATIONAL INPUTS THAT ARE SOURCED FROM OUTSIDE OF CANADA. OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE YEARS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ANY DEVALUATION, AS COMPARED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, OF THE CANADIAN DOLLAR OR ANY OF THE CURRENCIES OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  28  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  MAY 25,  2019 COMPARED WITH THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  MAY 26,  2018  REVENUES  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  MAY 25,  2019  MAY 26,  2018  DOLLAR  CHANGE  PERCENT  CHANGE  CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS  $399,781  $379,071  $20,710  5.5%  SPECIALTY GARMENTS  37,313  34,060  3,253  9.6%  FIRST AID  16,626  14,253  2,373  16.6%  CONSOLIDATED TOTAL  $453,720  $427,384  $26,336  6.2%  THE INCREASE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY FROM OUR CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS. EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF A WEAKER CANADIAN DOLLAR, WHICH UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED OUR GROWTH BY 0.3%, ORGANIC GROWTH FOR OUR CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS WAS 5.8%. ORGANIC GROWTH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF NEW SALES, PRICING ADJUSTMENTS, AND NET CHANGES IN THE WEARER LEVELS AT OUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS, OFFSET BY LOST ACCOUNTS. DURING THE QUARTER, OUR ORGANIC GROWTH RATE BENEFITED FROM SOLID NEW ACCOUNT SALES, SLIGHTLY FEWER LOST ACCOUNTS AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN PRICING ADJUSTMENTS AND INCREASES IN MERCHANDISE RECOVERY CHARGES.  SPECIALTY GARMENTS\u2019 RESULTS ARE OFTEN AFFECTED BY SEASONALITY AND THE TIMING AND LENGTH OF ITS CUSTOMERS\u2019 POWER REACTOR OUTAGES AS WELL AS ITS PROJECT-BASED ACTIVITIES. THE INCREASE IN SPECIALTY GARMENTS REVENUE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF ACQUISITIONS OF 7.6% AND ORGANIC GROWTH OF 3.6%, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE SEGMENT\u2019S CANADIAN AND EUROPEAN OPERATIONS.  FIRST AID REVENUE INCREASED 16.6% DURING THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MAY 25, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO THE EXPANSION OF THE FIRST AID VAN BUSINESS INTO ADDITIONAL GEOGRAPHIES AS WELL AS THE BENEFIT FROM THREE ACQUISITIONS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.

OUR CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS COST OF REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES DECREASED TO 61.2% IN THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MAY 25, 2019 FROM 62.3% IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. THIS DECREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER PRODUCTION AND SERVICE AND DELIVERY PAYROLL COSTS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER MERCHANDISE COSTS.  OUR SPECIALTY GARMENTS COSTS OF REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES WAS 65.2% IN THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MAY 25, 2019 AS COMPARED TO 62.8% IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN COST OF REVENUES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER PRODUCTION AND MERCHANDISE COSTS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2018 AS WELL AS HIGHER EXPENSES RELATED TO WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION AND AUTO CLAIMS.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS BALANCES, OUR CASH GENERATED FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT (DEFINED BELOW) WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CURRENT ANTICIPATED WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OUR LIQUIDITY. WE GENERALLY USE THESE CASH FLOWS TO FUND MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF OUR OPERATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND STOCK REPURCHASES. WE MAY ALSO USE CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS PROCEEDS FROM LOANS PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT, TO FUND GROWTH AND ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES, AS WELL AS OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS.

THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS PAID DURING THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED MAY 25, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  LONG-TERM DEBT AND BORROWING CAPACITY  WE HAVE A $250 MILLION UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH A SYNDICATE OF BANKS, WHICH MATURES ON APRIL 11, 2021. UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WE ARE ABLE TO BORROW FUNDS AT VARIABLE INTEREST RATES BASED ON, AT OUR ELECTION, THE EURODOLLAR RATE OR A BASE RATE, PLUS IN EACH CASE A SPREAD BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FUNDED DEBT RATIO. AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS, INCLUDING A MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED FUNDED DEBT RATIO AND MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. WE TEST OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS ON A FISCAL QUARTERLY BASIS. AS OF MAY 25, 2019, THE INTEREST RATES APPLICABLE TO OUR BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WOULD BE CALCULATED AS LIBOR PLUS 75 BASIS POINTS AT THE TIME OF THE RESPECTIVE BORROWING. AS OF MAY 25, 2019, WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AND HAD OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AMOUNTING TO $71.8 MILLION, LEAVING $178.2 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  AS OF MAY 25, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES  IN JUNE 2018, WE ENTERED INTO TWELVE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO EXCHANGE CAD FOR U.S. DOLLARS AT FIXED EXCHANGE RATES IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE RELATED TO CERTAIN FORECASTED CAD DENOMINATED SALES OF ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE SPECIFIED AS THE FIRST AMOUNT OF CAD DENOMINATED REVENUES INVOICED BY ONE OF OUR DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES EACH FISCAL QUARTER, BEGINNING IN THE THIRD FISCAL QUARTER OF 2019 AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF 2022. IN TOTAL, WE WILL SELL APPROXIMATELY 10.7 MILLION CAD AT AN AVERAGE CANADIAN-DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE OF 0.7814 OVER THESE QUARTERLY PERIODS. WE CONCLUDED THAT THE FORWARD CONTRACTS MET THE CRITERIA TO QUALIFY AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE UNDER U.S. GAAP.  AS OF MAY 25, 2019, WE HAD FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH A NOTIONAL VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY 10.7 MILLION CAD OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS OF $0.2 MILLION IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS AND $0.1 MILLION IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS WITH A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS OF $0.2 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED NET OF TAX. DURING THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED MAY 25, 2019, WE RECLASSIFIED $0.1 MILLION FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS TO REVENUE, RELATED TO THE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE GAIN ON THESE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT RESULTED IN A DECREASE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AS OF MAY 25, 2019 IS EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO REVENUES PRIOR TO ITS MATURITY ON FEBRUARY 25, 2022.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AIR EMISSIONS, WASTEWATER DISCHARGES, AND THE GENERATION, HANDLING, STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTES AND OTHER SUBSTANCES. IN PARTICULAR, INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRIES CURRENTLY USE AND MUST DISPOSE OF DETERGENT WASTE WATER AND OTHER RESIDUES, AND, IN THE PAST, USED PERCHLOROETHYLENE AND OTHER DRY CLEANING SOLVENTS. WE ARE ATTENTIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS SURROUNDING THE DISPOSAL OF THESE MATERIALS AND HAVE, THROUGH THE YEARS, TAKEN MEASURES TO AVOID THEIR IMPROPER DISPOSAL. OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE SETTLED, OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF, ACTIONS OR CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US RELATING TO THE DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO EXPEND MATERIAL AMOUNTS TO REMEDIATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH DISPOSAL IN THE FUTURE.  U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR CONTINGENCIES BE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF A LIABILITY, AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT TO BE RECORDED. WE REGULARLY CONSULT WITH ATTORNEYS AND OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS IN OUR CONSIDERATION OF THE RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE RECORDING A CONTINGENT LIABILITY. CHANGES IN ENACTED LAWS, REGULATORY ORDERS OR DECREES, OUR ESTIMATES OF COSTS, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES, INSURANCE PROCEEDS, PARTICIPATION BY OTHER PARTIES, THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS, THE INPUT OF OUR ATTORNEYS AND OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS OR OTHER FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES.  34  UNDER  ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, AN OWNER OR LESSEE OF REAL ESTATE MAY BE LIABLE FOR THE COSTS OF REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION OF CERTAIN HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES LOCATED ON, OR IN, OR EMANATING FROM SUCH PROPERTY, AS WELL AS RELATED COSTS OF INVESTIGATION AND PROPERTY  DAMAGE. SUCH LAWS OFTEN IMPOSE LIABILITY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE OWNER OR LESSEE KNEW OF, OR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR, THE PRESENCE OF SUCH HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT ACQUIRED OR LEASED LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN OPERATED IN  COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR THAT FUTURE USES OR CONDITIONS WILL NOT RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY UPON OUR COMPANY UNDER SUCH LAWS OR EXPOSE OUR COMPANY TO THIRD PARTY ACTIONS SUCH AS TORT SUITS.

WE HAVE ACCRUED CERTAIN COSTS RELATED TO THE SITES DESCRIBED ABOVE AS IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE COSTS ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. WE HAVE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE RELATED TO A PARCEL OF LAND (THE \u201cCENTRAL AREA\u201d) RELATED TO THE WOBURN, MASSACHUSETTS SITE MENTIONED ABOVE. CURRENTLY, THE CONSENT DECREE FOR THE WOBURN SITE DOES NOT DEFINE OR REQUIRE ANY REMEDIATION WORK IN THE CENTRAL AREA. THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (THE \u201cEPA\u201d) HAS PROVIDED US AND OTHER SIGNATORIES TO THE CONSENT DECREE WITH COMMENTS ON THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF GROUNDWATER AND SOIL REMEDIES AT THE WOBURN SITE AND INVESTIGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN THE CENTRAL AREA. WE, AND OTHER SIGNATORIES, HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND PROPOSED TO DO ADDITIONAL WORK AT THE WOBURN SITE BUT MANY OF THE EPA\u2019S COMMENTS REMAIN TO BE RESOLVED. WE HAVE ACCRUED COSTS TO PERFORM CERTAIN WORK RESPONSIVE TO EPA\u2019S COMMENTS. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED MITIGATION MEASURES AND CONTINUE TO MONITOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AT THE SOMERVILLE, MASSACHUSETTS SITE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RECEIVED DEMANDS FROM THE LOCAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW MUNICIPAL TRANSIT STATION IN THE AREA OF THE SOMERVILLE SITE. THIS STATION IS PART OF THE EXTENSION OF THE TRANSIT SYSTEM. WE HAVE RESERVED FOR COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS MATTER; HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MATTER, THESE COSTS AND THE RELATED RESERVE MAY CHANGE. WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED NOTICE THAT THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IS CONDUCTING AN AUDIT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION WORK WITH RESPECT TO THE SOMERVILLE SITE.  WE ROUTINELY REVIEW AND EVALUATE SITES THAT MAY REQUIRE REMEDIATION AND MONITORING AND DETERMINE OUR ESTIMATED COSTS BASED ON VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE DEVELOPED USING OUR INTERNAL SOURCES OR BY THIRD PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERS OR OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS. INTERNALLY DEVELOPED ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON.  \u2022  MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT AND EXPERIENCE IN REMEDIATING AND MONITORING OUR SITES;  \u2022  INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM REGULATORY AGENCIES AS TO COSTS OF REMEDIATION AND MONITORING;  \u2022  THE NUMBER, FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND RELATIVE DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY OF OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (\u201cPRPS\u201d) WHO MAY BE LIABLE FOR REMEDIATION AND MONITORING OF A SPECIFIC SITE; AND  \u2022  THE TYPICAL ALLOCATION OF COSTS AMONG PRPS.  THERE IS USUALLY A RANGE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH SITE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, OUR ACCRUALS REFLECT THE AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE THAT WE BELIEVE IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OR THE LOW END OF A RANGE OF ESTIMATES IF NO POINT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE. WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT BOTH THE AMOUNT OF A PARTICULAR LIABILITY AND THE TIMING OF THE PAYMENTS ARE RELIABLY DETERMINABLE, WE ADJUST THE COST IN CURRENT DOLLARS USING A RATE OF 3% FOR INFLATION UNTIL THE TIME OF EXPECTED PAYMENT AND DISCOUNT THE COST TO PRESENT VALUE USING CURRENT RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES. AS OF MAY 25, 2019, THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES WE UTILIZED RANGED FROM 2.3% TO 2.8%.  FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCOUNTED, WE INCLUDE INTEREST ACCRETION, BASED ON THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD, IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

ANNUAL PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION ARE DEPOSITED INTO AN ESCROW ACCOUNT WHICH FUNDS REMEDIATION AND MONITORING COSTS FOR TWO SITES RELATED TO OUR FORMER OPERATIONS IN WILLIAMSTOWN, VERMONT. ANNUAL PROCEEDS RECEIVED BUT NOT EXPENDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR ACCUMULATE IN THIS ACCOUNT AND MAY BE USED IN FUTURE YEARS FOR COSTS RELATED TO THIS SITE THROUGH THE YEAR 2027. AS OF MAY 25, 2019, THE BALANCE IN THIS ESCROW ACCOUNT, WHICH IS HELD IN A TRUST AND IS NOT RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, WAS APPROXIMATELY $4.2 MILLION. ALSO INCLUDED IN ESTIMATED INSURANCE PROCEEDS ARE AMOUNTS WE ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PURSUANT TO LEGAL SETTLEMENTS AS REIMBURSEMENTS FROM THREE INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR ESTIMATED COSTS AT THE SITE IN UVALDE, TEXAS.  OUR NUCLEAR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION FACILITIES ARE LICENSED BY THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (\u201cNRC\u201d), OR, IN CERTAIN CASES, BY THE APPLICABLE STATE AGENCY, AND ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. WE ALSO HAVE NUCLEAR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION FACILITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE NETHERLANDS. THESE FACILITIES ARE LICENSED AND REGULATED BY THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRY\u2019S APPLICABLE FEDERAL AGENCY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH REGULATION WILL NOT LEAD TO MATERIAL DISRUPTIONS IN OUR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION BUSINESS.  DURING FISCAL 2017, WE RECORDED A PRE-TAX NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $55.8 MILLION ONCE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED WOULD BE COMPLETED AND PLACED INTO SERVICE. ON DECEMBER 28, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR LEAD CONTRACTOR FOR THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO WHICH WE RECORDED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019 A TOTAL GAIN OF $21.1 MILLION AS A REDUCTION OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDES OUR RECEIPT OF A ONE-TIME CASH PAYMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $13.0 MILLION AS WELL AS THE FORGIVENESS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY DUE THE CONTRACTOR. WE ALSO RECEIVED HARDWARE AND RELATED MAINTENANCE SERVICE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $0.8 MILLION AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, CUSTOMER CONTRACT MATTERS, EMPLOYMENT CLAIMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  WHILE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO ASCERTAIN THE ULTIMATE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, INCLUDING LAWSUITS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES, WE BELIEVE THAT THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SUCH LIABILITIES, IF ANY, IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS COVERED BY INSURANCE HAVE BEEN PROPERLY ACCRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT THE FUTURE FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR FUTURE PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE CONTINGENCIES OR CHANGES OUT OF OUR CONTROL.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF MAY 25, 2019, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGULATION S-K.  SEASONALITY  HISTORICALLY, OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS HAVE VARIED FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE. THESE FLUCTUATIONS HAVE BEEN DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING: GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN OUR MARKETS; THE TIMING OF ACQUISITIONS AND OF COMMENCING START-UP OPERATIONS AND RELATED COSTS; OUR EFFECTIVENESS IN INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND START-UP OPERATIONS; THE TIMING OF NUCLEAR PLANT OUTAGES; CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; SEASONAL RENTAL AND PURCHASING PATTERNS OF OUR CUSTOMERS; AND PRICE CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS. IN ADDITION, OUR OPERATING RESULTS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN LOWER DURING THE SECOND AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS THAN DURING THE OTHER QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY HISTORICAL QUARTER ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR AN ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR OR ANY OTHER INTERIM PERIODS.  36  EFFECTS OF INFLATION  IN GENERAL, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON MODERATE CHANGES IN THE INFLATION RATE. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE THE IMPACTS OF MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN INFLATION RATES THROUGH OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS THAT GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR PRICE INCREASES CONSISTENT WITH THE RATE OF INFLATION, AND CONTINUED FOCUS ON IMPROVEMENTS OF OPERATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  AS OF MAY 25, 2019, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT WERE DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 25, 2018.

OUR VIRTUALIZATION SUBCONTRACT PROJECT SALES DECREASED BY  APPROXIMATELY 33% FROM 2017 TO 2018. OUR GOAL IS TO EXPAND OUR  VMWARE BUSINESS IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND COMMERCIAL SECTOR BY  BUILDING VMWARE LICENSE SALES VOLUME AND SERVICES CONCURRENTLY  DIRECTLY WITH CUSTOMERS RATHER THAN RELYING ON SUBCONTRACT PROJECT  SERVICES. SALES OF NODEWARE THROUGH OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS AND OTHER  IT PROJECTS COMPRISED THE BALANCE OF OUR SALES.  COST  OF SALES AND GROSS PROFIT  COST OF  SALES PRINCIPALLY REPRESENTS THE COST OF EMPLOYEE SERVICES RELATED  TO OUR IT SERVICES GROUP. IN SMALLER AMOUNTS, WE ALSO INCURRED COST  OF SALES FOR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE LICENSES FOR OUR COMMERCIAL SME  PARTNERS. AS VIRTUALIZATION PROJECT SALES DECREASED, RELATED  PERSONNEL COST OF SALES ALSO DECREASED.  OUR  GROSS PROFIT IMPROVED ALTHOUGH SALES DECREASED FOR THE THREE AND  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. WE IMPROVED OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN  FROM OUR MANAGED SERVICES  DUE TO LESS  CONTRACTOR USE. THIS  OFFSET DECREASED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN  FROM OUR VIRTUALIZATION PROJECTS. OTHER IT SERVICES CONTRIBUTED  GROSS PROFIT THROUGH IMPROVED UTILIZATION OF OUR  EMPLOYEES.  GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDE CORPORATE OVERHEAD SUCH AS  COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR EXECUTIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCE  PERSONNEL, RENT, INSURANCE, PROFESSIONAL FEES, TRAVEL, AND OFFICE  EXPENSES. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS RELATIVELY  UNCHANGED FOR THE PERIODS.  SELLING  EXPENSES  THE  DECREASE IN SELLING EXPENSES IS DUE TO THE REDUCTION OF EMPLOYEE  SALARIES AND BENEFITS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $111,500 AND $153,600  FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. WE ALSO REDUCED  OUR USE OF A MARKETING CONSULTANTS BY APPROXIMATELY $1,300 AND  $35,200 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. WE  REVISED OUR NODEWARE AND COMMERCIAL SME MARKETING EFFORTS TO USING  MORE ON-LINE AND INTERNET BASED MARKETING AND SELLING  TECHNIQUES.  OPERATING  LOSS  THE  REDUCTION IN OUR OPERATING LOSS IS PRINCIPALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN  IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN AND DECREASES IN SELLING EXPENSES  AS  EXPLAINED ABOVE  FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2018 AS COMPARED TO 2017.  INTEREST  EXPENSE  THE  INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE IS PRINCIPALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A NET  INCREASE IN LONG-TERM DEBT TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS  AND AN INCREASE IN  THE INTEREST RATES  . THE PRIME RATE INCREASED FROM 4.0% AT  DECEMBER 31, 2017 TO 4.75% ON MARCH 22, 2018 AND TO 5.00% ON JUNE  14, 2018 INCREASED OUR FINANCING COSTS UNDER OUR ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE FINANCING LINE AND OUR LINE OF CREDIT PAYABLE TO A  RELATED PARTY.  NET  LOSS  THE  DECREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ITEMS DISCUSSED ABOVE FOR THE THREE  AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 AS COMPARED TO  2017.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT JUNE  30, 2018, WE HAD CASH OF $4,446 AVAILABLE FOR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS  AND PLANNED CAPITAL ASSET EXPENDITURES. DURING 2018, WE FINANCED  OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY  OPERATIONS, SALES WITH RECOURSE OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND  BORROWINGS FROM RELATED PARTIES.

THIS PROVIDES US WITH THE CASH NEEDED TO  FINANCE CERTAIN OF OUR ON-GOING COSTS AND EXPENSES. AT JUNE 30,  2018, WE HAD FINANCING AVAILABILITY, BASED ON ELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE, OF APPROXIMATELY $11,000 UNDER THIS LINE. WE PAY FEES  BASED ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE INVOICE REMAINS  UNPAID.  WE  ENTERED INTO UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT FINANCING AGREEMENTS (THE  \u201cLOC AGREEMENTS\u201d) WITH THREE RELATED PARTIES. THE LOC  AGREEMENTS PROVIDE FOR WORKING CAPITAL OF UP TO $400,000 THROUGH  JANUARY 1, 2020, $100,000 THROUGH JULY 31, 2022 AND $75,000 THROUGH  JANUARY 2, 2023. AT JUNE 30, 2018, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $34,000 OF  AVAILABILITY UNDER THE LOC AGREEMENTS.  AT JUNE  30, 2018, WE HAD A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF APPROXIMATELY  $2,768,000 AND A CURRENT RATIO OF .05.

WE PLAN TO  RENEGOTIATE THE TERMS OF THE NOTES PAYABLE, SEEK FUNDS TO REPAY THE  NOTES OR USE A COMBINATION OF BOTH ALTERNATIVES.  ON JULY  12, 2018, WE BORROWED $70,000 FROM AN OFFICER OF THE COMPANY UNDER  THE TERMS OF AN UNSECURED DEMAND PROMISSORY NOTE WITH INTEREST AT  6%. THE BALANCE OF THIS NOTE IS $12,000 AT JUNE 30,  2018.  WE  BORROWED $20,000 FROM THE UNSECURED LINE OF CREDIT FINANCING  AGREEMENT WITH A RELATED PARTY DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.

WE BILL OUR CLIENTS WEEKLY OR MONTHLY AFTER  SERVICES ARE PERFORMED, DEPENDING ON THE CONTRACT TERMS. OUR NET  LOSS OF $130,000 FOR 2018 WAS OFFSET IN PART BY NON-CASH EXPENSES  AND CREDITS OF $8,976. IN ADDITION, A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE AND OTHER ASSETS OF $342,089 WAS OFFSET BY DECREASES IN  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES OF $309,683 RESULTING IN A  USE OF FUNDS OF $88,618.  WE  MARKET WEBROOT AND NODEWARE TO OUR IT CHANNEL PARTNERS WHO RESELL  TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. WE ARE MAKING INVESTMENTS IN EXPANDING OUR  SALES OF CYBER SECURITY AND VIRTUALIZATION PROJECTS AND VMWARE  LICENSES TO COMMERCIAL AND SLED CUSTOMERS. DUE TO THE LENGTHY LEAD  TIMES TYPICALLY NEEDED TO GENERATE THESE NEW SALES, WE DO NOT  EXPECT TO REALIZE A RETURN FROM OUR SALES AND MARKETING PERSONNEL  FOR ONE OR MORE QUARTERS. AS A RESULT, WE MAY CONTINUE TO  EXPERIENCE OPERATING LOSSES FROM THESE INVESTMENTS IN PERSONNEL  UNTIL SUFFICIENT SALES ARE GENERATED. WE EXPECT TO FUND THE COST  FOR THE NEW SALES PERSONNEL FROM OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND  INCREMENTAL BORROWINGS, AS NEEDED.  CASH  FLOWS USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NO CASH  WAS USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE  30, 2018. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN COMPUTER HARDWARE AND  SOFTWARE TO UPDATE OUR TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT OUR  BUSINESS.  CASH  FLOWS PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH  PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $19,330 FOR THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 CONSISTING OF $20,000 IN BORROWINGS FROM A  RELATED PARTY OFFSET BY PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF $670 TO A RELATED  PARTY.  CREDIT RESOURCES  WE MAINTAIN AN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FINANCING LINE OF CREDIT FROM AN  INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT ALLOWS US TO SELL SELECTED  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INVOICES TO THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WITH FULL  RECOURSE AGAINST US IN THE AMOUNT OF $2,000,000, INCLUDING A  SUBLIMIT FOR ONE MAJOR CLIENT OF $1,500,000. THIS PROVIDES US WITH  THE CASH NEEDED TO FINANCE CERTAIN COSTS AND EXPENSES. AT JUNE 30,  2018, WE HAD FINANCING AVAILABILITY, BASED ON ELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE, OF APPROXIMATELY $11,000 UNDER THIS LINE. WE PAY FEES  BASED ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE INVOICE REMAINS  UNPAID.  12  WE BELIEVE THE CAPITAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE UNDER OUR FACTORING LINE  OF CREDIT, CASH FROM ADDITIONAL RELATED PARTY AND THIRD-PARTY LOANS  AND CASH GENERATED BY IMPROVING THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS  PROVIDE SOURCES TO FUND THE ONGOING OPERATIONS AND TO SUPPORT OUR  INTERNAL GROWTH. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT GIVE ANY ASSURANCES, WE BELIEVE  THAT RELATED PARTIES, WHO HAVE PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED WORKING CAPITAL,  AND THIRD PARTIES WILL CONTINUE TOPROVIDE WORKING CAPITAL LOANS ON  SIMILAR TERMS, AS IN THE PAST, AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO FUND OUR  ON-GOING OPERATIONS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

A FIFTH DIAMOND DRILL HOLE DRILLED TO AN ESTIMATED DEPTH OF APPROXIMATELY 265 FEET  WITH THE RECOVERED LITHIUM ENRICHED MATERIAL BEING USED FOR METALLURGICAL AND PH SOLUTION TESTING. THE COMPANY WILL UNDERTAKE SYSTEMATIC AND THROUGH SOLUTION TESTING OF THE DRILLED LITHIUM ENRICHED HORIZONS. THIS WILL ENABLE THE COMPANY TO MAP THE  SUBSURFACE HORIZONS AS PER OXIDE AND REDUCED HORIZONS AND FURTHER DIFFERENTIATE THE GRADE OF LITHIUM IN SOLUTION THAT CAN BE POTENTIALLY RECOVERED IN A LOW CAPEX AND LOW-COST EXTRACTION METHODS.

(\"GWT\") WITH REGARD TO  THE ACQUISITION BY ENERTOPIA OF THE EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE LICENSING RIGHTS (THE  \"LICENSING RIGHTS\") BY ENERTOPIA OF ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGY USED IN THE PROCESS OF  RECOVERING AND EXTRACTION OF BATTERY GRADE LITHIUM CARBONATE POWDER LI2CO3  GRADING 99.5% OR HIGHER PURITY FROM BRINE SOLUTIONS.  UPON THE EXECUTION OF THIS LOI, ENERTOPIA ISSUED 250,000 COMMON  SHARES VALUED AT $12,500 TO GWT.  ON DECEMBER 6, 2016, AND AMENDED ON OCTOBER 9, 2017, ENERTOPIA  AND GWT SIGNED A DEFINITIVE COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE ACQUISITION  BY ENERTOPIA OF THE EXCLUSIVE LICENSING RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES OF  AMERICA,  ARGENTINA, BOLIVIA AND CHILE OF ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGY USED IN THE PROCESS OF RECOVERING AND EXTRACTION OF BATTERY GRADE LITHIUM CARBONATE POWDER LI2CO3 GRADING 99.5% OR HIGHER PURITY FROM BRINE SOLUTIONS.  ON JULY 4, 2018, THE COMPANY PROVIDED GWT WITH A FORMAL NOTICE OF TERMINATION OF THE COMMERCIALIZATION AGREEMENT. FOLLOWING TERMINATION, THE COMPANY HAS NO FURTHER OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMERCIALIZATION AGREEMENT. AS A RESULT, FOR THE  YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018, THE COMPANY WROTE OFF CAPITALIZED COSTS OF $12,500.  ON MAY 23, 2019 THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE 3  RD  PHASE OF GRAIN SORTING TESTING RESULTS. WITH THE GOAL OF THIS ROUND OF TESTING TO SHOW THAT POTENTIALLY PRE-SORTING OF THE LITHIUM HOSTED CLAYSTONE MATERIAL COULD BE CONCENTRATED, THESE TESTS  ARE ONGOING, AND THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO CONCENTRATE ON USING OFF THE SHELF TECHNOLOGY UNDER A POTENTIAL LOW CAPEX SCENARIO.  SUMMARY  THE CONTINUATION OF OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT UPON OBTAINING FURTHER FINANCING, A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM OF DEVELOPMENT, AND, FINALLY, ACHIEVING A PROFITABLE LEVEL OF OPERATIONS. THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES BY US COULD RESULT IN A  SIGNIFICANT DILUTION IN THE EQUITY INTERESTS OF OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS. OBTAINING COMMERCIAL LOANS, ASSUMING THOSE LOANS WOULD BE AVAILABLE, WILL INCREASE OUR LIABILITIES AND FUTURE CASH COMMITMENTS.  THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FURTHER FUNDS REQUIRED FOR OUR CONTINUED OPERATIONS. AS NOTED HEREIN, WE ARE PURSUING VARIOUS FINANCING ALTERNATIVES TO MEET OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG-TERM FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. THERE CAN BE NO  ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US WHEN NEEDED OR, IF AVAILABLE, THAT IT CAN BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN THE ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO CONDUCT  OUR OPERATIONS AS PLANNED, AND WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET OUR OTHER OBLIGATIONS AS THEY BECOME DUE. IN SUCH EVENT, WE WILL BE FORCED TO SCALE DOWN OR PERHAPS EVEN CEASE OUR OPERATIONS. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER WE CAN OBTAIN  ADDITIONAL FINANCING.  COMPETITION  THERE IS STRONG COMPETITION RELATING TO ALL ASPECTS OF THE RESOURCE SECTOR. WE ACTIVELY COMPETE FOR CAPITAL, SKILLED PERSONNEL, MARKET SHARE, AND IN ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR OPERATIONS WITH A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. THESE  ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDE SMALL DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANIES LIKE OUR OWN, AND LARGE, ESTABLISHED COMPANIES, MANY OF WHICH HAVE GREATER TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN OUR COMPANY.  COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION  THE EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF MINERAL PROPERTIES IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS. WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME, BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN LICENSES AND PERMITS FROM VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL  AUTHORITIES IN REGARDS TO THE EXPLORATION OF OUR PROPERTY INTERESTS.  PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITION  NOT APPLICABLE  CORPORATE OFFICES  THE ADDRESS OF OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICE IS #22-1873 SPALL ROAD, KELOWNA, BRITISH COLUMBIA V1Y 4R2. OUR TELEPHONE NUMBER IS (250) 870-2219. OUR CURRENT LOCATION PROVIDES ADEQUATE OFFICE SPACE FOR OUR PURPOSES AT THIS STAGE OF OUR  DEVELOPMENT.  EMPLOYEES  WE PRIMARILY USED THE SERVICES OF SUB-CONTRACTORS AND CONSULTANTS FOR OUR INTENDED BUSINESS OPERATIONS. OUR TECHNICAL CONSULTANT IS MR. MCALLISTER, OUR PRESIDENT AND A DIRECTOR.  WE ENTERED INTO A CONSULTING AGREEMENT WITH MR. ROBERT MCALLISTER ON DECEMBER 1, 2007. DURING THE TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT, MR. MCALLISTER IS TO PROVIDE CORPORATE ADMINISTRATION AND CONSULTING SERVICES, SUCH DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES TO INCLUDE  PROVISION OF OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY CONSULTING SERVICES, STRATEGIC CORPORATE AND FINANCIAL PLANNING, MANAGEMENT OF THE OVERALL BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, AND SUPERVISING OFFICE STAFF AND EXPLORATION  AND OIL & GAS CONSULTANTS. MR. MCALLISTER IS REIMBURSED AT THE RATE OF $2,000 PER MONTH. ON DECEMBER 1, 2008, THE CONSULTING FEE WAS INCREASED TO $5,000 PER MONTH. WE MAY TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE BASED ON A NUMBER OF  CONDITIONS. MR. MCALLISTER MAY TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME BY GIVING 30 DAYS WRITTEN NOTICE OF HIS INTENTION TO DO SO. EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2014, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NEW MANAGEMENT CONSULTING AGREEMENT REPLACING THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT  WITH A CONSULTING FEE OF $6,500 PLUS GST PER MONTH. EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2017, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NEW MANAGEMENT CONSULTING AGREEMENT REPLACING THE MARCH 1, 2014 AGREEMENT WITH A CONSULTING FEE OF $3,500 PLUS GST PER MONTH. ON JULY 31,  2017 MR. MCALLISTER AGREED TO BE INTERN CFO UNTIL SUCH TIME AS A REPLACEMENT COULD BE SOURCED.  WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTH PERIOD. WE DO AND WILL CONTINUE TO OUTSOURCE CONTRACT EMPLOYMENT AS NEEDED.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT ARE MATERIAL TO STOCKHOLDERS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT  AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENT'S APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. WE BELIEVE THAT UNDERSTANDING THE BASIS AND NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES AND  ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED WITH THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS CRITICAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIALS.  MINERAL PROPERTIES  ACQUISITION COSTS OF MINERAL RIGHTS ARE INITIALLY CAPITALIZED AS INCURRED WHILE EXPLORATION AND PRE-EXTRACTION EXPENDITURES ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED UNTIL SUCH TIME PROVEN OR PROBABLE RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED FOR THAT PROJECT. ACQUISITION COSTS  INCLUDE CASH CONSIDERATION AND THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF SHARES ISSUED ON THE ACQUISITION OF MINERAL PROPERTIES.  EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND EXPENDITURES RELATING TO PRE-EXTRACTION ACTIVITIES ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED UNTIL SUCH TIME PROVEN OR PROBABLE RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED FOR THAT PROJECT, AFTER WHICH  SUBSEQUENT EXPENDITURES RELATING TO DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES FOR THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT ARE CAPITALIZED AS INCURRED.  WHERE PROVEN AND PROBABLE RESERVES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE PROJECT\u2019S CAPITALIZED EXPENDITURES ARE DEPLETED OVER PROVEN AND PROBABLE RESERVES USING THE UNITS-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD UPON COMMENCEMENT OF PRODUCTION. WHERE PROVEN AND PROBABLE  RESERVES HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE PROJECT\u2019S CAPITALIZED EXPENDITURES ARE DEPLETED OVER THE ESTIMATED EXTRACTION LIFE USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD UPON COMMENCEMENT OF EXTRACTION. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED PROVEN OR PROBABLE  RESERVES FOR ANY OF ITS PROJECTS.  THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE MINERAL RIGHTS ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT BY MANAGEMENT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND AS REQUIRED WHENEVER INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT EXIST. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE CARRYING VALUE IS NOT  RECOVERABLE AND EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE.  LONG-LIVED ASSETS IMPAIRMENT  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 360, \u201cACCOUNTING FOR IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG LIVED ASSETS\u201d, THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG LIVED ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR RECOVERABILITY WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT ITS CARRYING AMOUNT  MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE SUM OF THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES, IF ANY, ARE MEASURED AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE  ASSET OVER ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM PRODUCT SALES WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, TITLE TO PRODUCT AND ASSOCIATED RISK OF LOSS HAS PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, THE PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, COLLECTION FROM THE CUSTOMER IS  REASONABLY ASSURED, THE COMPANY HAS NO FURTHER PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, AND RETURNS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.  GOING CONCERN  WE HAVE SUFFERED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS. THE CONTINUATION OF OUR COMPANY AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR COMPANY ATTAINING AND MAINTAINING PROFITABLE OPERATIONS AND/OR RAISING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT  INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENT RELATING TO THE RECOVERY AND CLASSIFICATION OF RECORDED ASSET AMOUNTS OR THE AMOUNT AND CLASSIFICATION OF LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SHOULD OUR COMPANY DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS.  THE CONTINUATION OF OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT UPON US RAISING ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND/OR ATTAINING AND MAINTAINING PROFITABLE LEVELS OF INTERNALLY GENERATED REVENUE. THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES BY US COULD RESULT IN A  SIGNIFICANT DILUTION IN THE EQUITY INTERESTS OF OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS. OBTAINING COMMERCIAL LOANS, ASSUMING THOSE LOANS WOULD BE AVAILABLE, WILL INCREASE OUR LIABILITIES AND FUTURE CASH COMMITMENTS.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-07, WHICH SIMPLIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE AMENDMENTS SPECIFY THAT TOPIC 718 APPLIES TO ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH A GRANTOR ACQUIRES GOODS OR  SERVICES TO BE USED OR CONSUMED IN A GRANTOR\u2019S OWN OPERATIONS BY ISSUING SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS. THE STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR 2020, ALTHOUGH EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED (BUT NO SOONER THAN  THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606). WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS ASU WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2016, TOPIC 842, LEASES WAS ISSUED TO REPLACE THE LEASES REQUIREMENTS IN TOPIC 840, LEASES. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PREVIOUS GAAP AND TOPIC 842 IS THE RECOGNITION OF LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES BY LESSEES FOR THOSE LEASES  CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES UNDER PREVIOUS GAAP. A LESSEE SHOULD RECOGNIZE IN THE BALANCE SHEET A LIABILITY TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS (THE LEASE LIABILITY) AND A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET REPRESENTING ITS RIGHT TO USE THE UNDERLYING ASSET FOR THE LEASE  TERM. FOR LEASES WITH A TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS, A LESSEE IS PERMITTED TO MAKE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION BY CLASS OF UNDERLYING ASSET NOT TO RECOGNIZE LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES. IF A LESSEE MAKES THIS ELECTION, IT SHOULD RECOGNIZE  LEASE EXPENSE FOR SUCH LEASES GENERALLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. THE ACCOUNTING APPLIED BY A LESSOR IS LARGELY UNCHANGED FROM THAT APPLIED UNDER PREVIOUS GAAP. TOPIC 842 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING  AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE ANNUAL PERIODS AND IS TO BE RETROSPECTIVELY APPLIED. EARLIER APPLICATION IS PERMITTED. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CASH FLOWS, AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCLOSURES.  OTHER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED OR PROPOSED BY THE FASB OR OTHER STANDARDS-SETTING BODIES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE ADOPTION UNTIL A FUTURE DATE ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON  ADOPTION.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  WE MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE  DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN OUR REPORTS  FILED UNDER THE  SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934  , AS AMENDED, IS RECORDED,  PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S RULES AND FORMS, AND THAT SUCH INFORMATION  IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRESIDENT (ALSO  OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER) AND OUR SECRETARY, TREASURER AND CHIEF  FINANCIAL OFFICER (ALSO OUR PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING OFFICER) TO ALLOW  FOR TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.  AS AT MAY 31, 2019, THE END OF OUR THIRD QUARTER COVERED BY  THIS REPORT, WE CARRIED OUT AN EVALUATION, UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE  PARTICIPATION OF OUR PRESIDENT (ALSO OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER) AND OUR  SECRETARY, TREASURER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (ALSO OUR PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL  AND ACCOUNTING OFFICER), OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF OUR  DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. BASED ON THE FOREGOING, OUR PRESIDENT (ALSO  OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER) AND OUR SECRETARY, TREASURER AND CHIEF  FINANCIAL OFFICER (ALSO OUR PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING OFFICER)  CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE IN  PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE IN THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTS AS OF  THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS QUARTERLY REPORT.  INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF  CONTROLS  INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING HAS INHERENT  LIMITATIONS WHICH INCLUDE BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO THE USE OF INDEPENDENT  PROFESSIONALS FOR ADVICE AND GUIDANCE, INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING AND/OR  CHANGING RULES AND PRINCIPLES, SEGREGATION OF MANAGEMENT DUTIES, SCALE OF  ORGANIZATION, AND PERSONNEL FACTORS. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  IS A PROCESS WHICH INVOLVES HUMAN DILIGENCE AND COMPLIANCE AND IS SUBJECT TO  LAPSES IN JUDGMENT AND BREAKDOWNS RESULTING FROM HUMAN FAILURES. INTERNAL  CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING ALSO CAN BE CIRCUMVENTED BY COLLUSION OR  IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL  CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS ON A  TIMELY BASIS, HOWEVER THESE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ARE KNOWN FEATURES OF THE  FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO DESIGN INTO THE PROCESS  SAFEGUARDS TO REDUCE, THOUGH NOT ELIMINATE, THIS RISK. THEREFORE, EVEN THOSE  SYSTEMS DETERMINED TO BE EFFECTIVE CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH  RESPECT TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION. PROJECTIONS OF ANY  EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT  CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE  DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL  REPORTING  THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER  FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT OCCURRED DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 31,  2019, THAT HAVE MATERIALLY OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR  INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.  PART II  OTHER INFORMATION  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  WE KNOW OF NO MATERIAL, EXISTING OR PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  AGAINST OUR COMPANY, NOR ARE WE INVOLVED AS A PLAINTIFF IN ANY MATERIAL  PROCEEDING OR PENDING LITIGATION. THERE ARE NO PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH ANY OF OUR  DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OR AFFILIATES, OR ANY REGISTERED OR BENEFICIAL  STOCKHOLDER, IS AN ADVERSE PARTY OR HAS A MATERIAL INTEREST ADVERSE TO OUR  INTEREST.  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  MUCH OF THE INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS PROSPECTUS INCLUDES OR  IS BASED UPON ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS OR OTHER \"FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\". SUCH  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE ANY PROJECTIONS OR ESTIMATES MADE BY US AND  OUR MANAGEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. WHILE THESE  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, AND ANY ASSUMPTIONS UPON WHICH THEY ARE BASED, ARE  MADE IN GOOD FAITH AND REFLECT OUR CURRENT JUDGMENT REGARDING THE DIRECTION OF  OUR BUSINESS, ACTUAL RESULTS WILL ALMOST ALWAYS VARY, SOMETIMES MATERIALLY, FROM  ANY ESTIMATES, PREDICTIONS, PROJECTIONS, ASSUMPTIONS, OR OTHER FUTURE  PERFORMANCE SUGGESTED HEREIN. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS TO REFLECT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OCCURRING AFTER  THE DATE OF SUCH STATEMENTS.  SUCH ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS OR OTHER \"FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS\" INVOLVE VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AS OUTLINED BELOW. WE  CAUTION READERS OF THIS PROSPECTUS THAT IMPORTANT FACTORS IN SOME CASES HAVE  AFFECTED AND, IN THE FUTURE, COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT ACTUAL RESULTS AND CAUSE  ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS EXPRESSED IN ANY SUCH  ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS OR OTHER \"FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\". IN EVALUATING US,  OUR BUSINESS AND ANY INVESTMENT IN OUR BUSINESS, READERS SHOULD CAREFULLY  CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.  OUR COMMON SHARES ARE CONSIDERED SPECULATIVE. PROSPECTIVE  INVESTORS SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE RISK FACTORS SET OUT BELOW.  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH BUSINESS  OUR COMPANY HAS NO OPERATING HISTORY AND AN EVOLVING  BUSINESS MODEL, WHICH RAISES DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY OR  OBTAIN FINANCING.  OUR COMPANY HAS NO OPERATING HISTORY. MOREOVER, OUR BUSINESS  MODEL IS STILL EVOLVING, SUBJECT TO CHANGE, AND WILL RELY ON THE COOPERATION AND  PARTICIPATION OF OUR JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS. OUR COMPANY'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE  AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCING  AND TO REACH PROFITABLE LEVELS OF OPERATIONS AND WE NO PROVEN HISTORY OF PERFORMANCE, EARNINGS OR SUCCESS. THERE  CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY OR OBTAIN FUTURE  FINANCING.  UNCERTAIN DEMAND FOR MINERAL RESOURCES SECTOR MAY CAUSE OUR  BUSINESS PLAN TO BE UNPROFITABLE.  DEMAND FOR MINERAL RESOURCES IS BASED ON THE WORLD ECONOMY AND  NEW TECHNOLOGIES. CURRENT LITHIUM DEMAND EXCEEDS AVAILABLE SUPPLY DUE TO THE  RAPID INCREASE IN LITHIUM BATTERIES IN PORTABLE ELECTRONICS AND THE GROWING  ELECTRIC VEHICLE MARKETS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CURRENT SUPPLY AND  DEMAND FACTORS WILL REMAIN THE SAME OR THAT PROJECTED SUPPLY AND DEMAND FACTORS  WILL ACTUALLY COME TO PASS FROM 3  RD  PARTY PROJECTIONS THAT ARE  CURRENTLY BELIEVED TO BE TRUE AND ACCURATE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT NEW  DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES WILL REPLACE LITHIUM AS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT IN  BATTERY STORAGE OVER TIME.  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN OUR COMPANY AND OUR DIRECTORS  AND OFFICERS MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.  OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO COMMIT THEIR  FULL TIME AND ATTENTION TO OUR BUSINESS AND, ACCORDINGLY, THEY MAY ENCOUNTER A  CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN ALLOCATING THEIR TIME BETWEEN OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS AND  THOSE OF OTHER BUSINESSES. IN THE COURSE OF THEIR OTHER BUSINESS ACTIVITIES,  THEY MAY BECOME AWARE OF INVESTMENT AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WHICH MAY BE  APPROPRIATE FOR PRESENTATION TO US AS WELL AS OTHER ENTITIES TO WHICH THEY OWE A  FIDUCIARY DUTY. AS A RESULT, THEY MAY HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN DETERMINING  TO WHICH ENTITY A PARTICULAR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE PRESENTED. THEY MAY  ALSO IN THE FUTURE BECOME AFFILIATED WITH ENTITIES, ENGAGED IN BUSINESS  ACTIVITIES SIMILAR TO THOSE WE INTEND TO CONDUCT.  IN GENERAL, OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF A CORPORATION ARE  REQUIRED TO PRESENT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES TO A CORPORATION IF.  \u2022  THE CORPORATION COULD FINANCIALLY  UNDERTAKE THE OPPORTUNITY;  \u2022  THE OPPORTUNITY IS WITHIN THE  CORPORATION\u2019S LINE OF BUSINESS; AND  \u2022  IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO THE  CORPORATION AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS NOT TO BRING THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE  ATTENTION OF THE CORPORATION.  WE PLAN TO ADOPT A CODE OF ETHICS THAT OBLIGATES OUR DIRECTORS,  OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES TO DISCLOSE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND PROHIBITS  THOSE PERSONS FROM ENGAGING IN SUCH TRANSACTIONS WITHOUT OUR CONSENT. DESPITE  OUR INTENTIONS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST MAY NEVERTHELESS ARISE WHICH MAY DEPRIVE  OUR COMPANY OF A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, WHICH MAY IMPEDE THE SUCCESSFUL  DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BUSINESS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN  OUR COMPANY.  THE SPECULATIVE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN MAY RESULT IN  THE LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT.  OUR OPERATIONS ARE IN THE START-UP OR STAGE ONLY, AND ARE  UNPROVEN. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN IMPLEMENTING OUR BUSINESS PLAN TO BECOME  PROFITABLE. THERE MAY BE LESS DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES THAN WE ANTICIPATE. THERE  IS NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL SUCCEED AND YOU MAY LOSE YOUR ENTIRE  INVESTMENT.  CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES MAY CAUSE OUR PLANNED PRODUCTS  TO BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN THE MARKETPLACE.  THE DECISION OF A POTENTIAL CLIENT TO UNDERGO AN ENVIRONMENTAL  AUDIT OR REVIEW MAY BE BASED ON ETHICAL OR COMMERCIAL REASONS. IN SOME  INSTANCES, OR WITH CERTAIN BUSINESSES, THERE MAY BE NO ASSURANCE THAT AN  ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW WILL RESULT IN ANY COST SAVINGS OR INCREASED REVENUES. AS  SUCH, UNLESS THE ETHICAL CONSIDERATION IS ALSO A MATERIAL FACTOR, THERE MAY BE  NO INCENTIVE FOR SUCH BUSINESSES TO UNDERTAKE AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. CHANGES  IN CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL PREFERENCES, OR TRENDS, TOWARD OR AWAY FROM  ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES MAY IMPACT ON BUSINESSES\u201d DECISIONS TO UNDERGO  ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS.  GENERAL ECONOMIC FACTORS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE MARKET  FOR OUR PLANNED PRODUCTS.  THE WILLINGNESS OF BUSINESSES TO SPEND TIME AND MONEY ON ENERGY  EFFICIENCY MAY BE DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; AND ANY MATERIAL  DOWNTURN MAY REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF BUSINESSES INCURRING COSTS TOWARD WHAT  SOME BUSINESSES MAY CONSIDER A DISCRETIONARY EXPENSE ITEM.  A WIDE RANGE OF ECONOMIC AND LOGISTICAL FACTORS MAY  NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  OUR OPERATING RESULTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF  FACTORS THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY, INCLUDING THE  TIMING AND CANCELLATION OF CUSTOMER ORDERS AND PROJECTS, COMPETITIVE PRESSURES  ON PRICING, AVAILABILITY OF PERSONNEL, AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR SERVICES. AS  A RESULT, WE MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL FLUCTUATIONS  IN FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS ON A QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL BASIS WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.  CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CURRENTLY COMPLY WITH EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING OUR PROPOSED OPERATIONS. WHILE THERE ARE NO CURRENTLY KNOWN PROPOSED CHANGES IN THESE LAWS OR REGULATIONS, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAVE AFFECTED THE INDUSTRY  IN THE PAST AND ADDITIONAL CHANGES MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT (\u201cBLM\u201d), STATE AND POTENTIALLY OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WITH RESPECT TO ITS LITHIUM BRINE BUSINESS.  OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES PROMULGATED FROM TIME TO TIME BY GOVERNMENT. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN TYPES OF OPERATIONS REQUIRE THE SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS. ENVIRONMENTAL  LEGISLATION IS EVOLVING IN A MANNER THAT MEANS STRICTER STANDARDS AND ENFORCEMENT. FINES AND PENALTIES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE ARE MORE STRINGENT. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS OF PROPOSED PROJECTS CARRY A HEIGHTENED DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPANIES,  DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES. THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS HAS POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF OPERATIONS. WE INTEND TO COMPLY WITH ALL ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.  LOSS OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN OUR COMPANY OR IN OUR INDUSTRY MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS.  DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF CONSUMERS LOSE CONFIDENCE IN THE QUALITY OF OUR SERVICES OR THE INDUSTRY\u2019S PRACTICES. ADVERSE PUBLICITY MAY DISCOURAGE BUSINESSES FROM BUYING OUR SERVICES AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE  EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. VARIOUS FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, INCLUDING PRODUCT QUALITY INCONSISTENCIES OR CONTAMINATION RESULTING IN PRODUCT RECALLS. REPUTATIONAL RISKS MAY ALSO ARISE FROM OUR  THIRD PARTIES\u2019 LABOUR STANDARDS, HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS, RAW MATERIAL SOURCING, AND ETHICAL STANDARDS. WE MAY ALSO BE THE VICTIM OF PRODUCT TAMPERING OR COUNTERFEITING OR GREY IMPORTS. ANY LITIGATION, DISPUTES ON TAX  MATTERS AND PAY STRUCTURES MAY SUBJECT US TO NEGATIVE ATTENTION IN THE PRESS, WHICH CAN DAMAGE REPUTATION.  THE FAILURE TO SECURE CUSTOMERS MAY CAUSE OUR OPERATIONS TO FAIL.  WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS WITH ANY CUSTOMERS. MANY OF OUR SALES MAY BE ON A \u201cONETIME\u201d BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, WE WILL REQUIRE NEW CUSTOMERS ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS. RISK OF MATERIAL IMPACT ON GROUP  GROWTH AND PROFIT OF CONSUMER LED SLOWDOWN IN KEY DEVELOPING MARKETS, EXACERBATED BY INCREASING CURRENCY VOLATILITY. A VARIETY OF FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION DURING PERIODS OF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY  OR INSTABILITY, SOCIAL OR LABOUR UNREST OR POLITICAL UPHEAVAL IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. SUCH PERIODS MAY ALSO LEAD TO GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, SUCH AS IMPOSITION OF MARTIAL LAW, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, FOREIGN OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS, CAPITAL, PRICE  OR CURRENCY CONTROLS, NATIONALIZATION OR EXPROPRIATION OF PROPERTY OR OTHER RESOURCES, OR CHANGES IN LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND TAXATION REGIMES.  IF WE FAIL TO EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY ADVERTISE, THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS MAY BE COMPROMISED.  THE FUTURE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS WILL BE DEPENDENT IN PART ON THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF OUR ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO (I) CREATE GREATER AWARENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS, (II) DETERMINE  THE APPROPRIATE CREATIVE MESSAGE AND MEDIA MIX FOR FUTURE ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES, AND (III) EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ACCEPTABLE OPERATING MARGINS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL EXPERIENCE  BENEFITS FROM ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENDITURES IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR PLANNED ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENDITURES WILL RESULT IN INCREASED REVENUES, WILL GENERATE LEVELS OF SERVICE AND NAME  AWARENESS OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE SUCH ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENDITURES ON A COST-EFFECTIVE BASIS.  OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR UNPROVEN ABILITY TO ATTRACT QUALIFIED PERSONNEL.  WE DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM, CONSULTANTS AND ADVISORS. THERE IS STRONG COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL IN THE BUSINESS SECTOR, AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT SUCH COMPETITION  WILL INCREASE. OUR PLANNED GROWTH WILL PLACE INCREASED DEMANDS ON OUR EXISTING RESOURCES AND WILL LIKELY REQUIRE THE ADDITION OF TECHNICAL PERSONNEL AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL EXPERTISE BY EXISTING PERSONNEL.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR COMPENSATION PACKAGES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL WHO ARE NECESSARY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BUSINESS.  WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY WITH LOSSES AND WE EXPECT THE LOSSES TO CONTINUE, WHICH RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  WE HAVE GENERATED MINIMAL REVENUES SINCE OUR INCEPTION AND WILL, IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, CONTINUE TO INCUR OPERATING EXPENSES WITH MINIMAL REVENUES UNTIL WE ARE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP OUR BUSINESS. OUR BUSINESS PLAN WILL REQUIRE US TO INCUR FURTHER  EXPENSES. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EVER BECOME PROFITABLE. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AND MUST BE CONSIDERED IN THE START-UP STAGE.  THERE IS AN EXPLANATORY PARAGRAPH TO THEIR AUDIT OPINION ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 WITH RESPECT TO THEIR DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 TO  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018, WE HAVE INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $650,055 FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 (NET LOSS $801,166 FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2017) AND AS AT AUGUST 31, 2018 HAVE INCURRED CUMULATIVE  LOSSES OF $13,891,818 THAT RAISES SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. OUR MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN ABLE, THUS FAR, TO FINANCE THE OPERATIONS THROUGH EQUITY FINANCING AND CASH ON HAND. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR  COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO FINANCE OUR COMPANY ON THIS BASIS.  WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO DEVELOP OUR BUSINESS PLAN, OUR BUSINESS MAY FAIL.  BECAUSE WE HAVE GENERATED ONLY MINIMAL REVENUE FROM OUR BUSINESS AND CANNOT ANTICIPATE WHEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE MEANINGFUL REVENUE FROM OUR BUSINESS, WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO CONDUCT AND GROW OUR BUSINESS. WE DO NOT  CURRENTLY HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO COMPLETELY FUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL NEED TO RAISE FURTHER FINANCING. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ANY ARRANGEMENTS FOR FINANCING AND WE CAN PROVIDE NO  ASSURANCE TO INVESTORS THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND SUCH FINANCING IF REQUIRED. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF FUTURE FUNDS PRESENTLY AVAILABLE TO US IS THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY CAPITAL. ANY SALE OF SHARE CAPITAL WILL RESULT IN DILUTION TO EXISTING  SECURITY-HOLDERS.  WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ALL OF THE LICENSES NECESSARY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS, WHICH WOULD CAUSE OUR BUSINESS TO FAIL.  OUR OPERATIONS REQUIRE LICENSES AND PERMITS FROM VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES RELATED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR PLANNED FACILITIES, TO THE PRODUCTION, STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND TO THE DISPOSAL OF WASTE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE  WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ALL NECESSARY LICENSES AND PERMITS UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS FOR OUR OPERATIONS AND BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLY IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH THE TERMS OF SUCH LICENSES AND PERMITS. HOWEVER, SUCH LICENSES AND  PERMITS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE IN VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE CAN BE NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN ALL NECESSARY LICENSES AND PERMITS.  CHANGES IN HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATION MAY RESULT IN INCREASED OR INSUPPORTABLE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON OUR COMPANY.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CURRENTLY COMPLY WITH EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING OUR PRODUCT AND OPERATIONS. WHILE THERE ARE NO CURRENTLY KNOWN PROPOSED CHANGES IN THESE LAWS OR REGULATIONS, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAVE AFFECTED THE INDUSTRY IN THE PAST  AND ADDITIONAL CHANGES MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.  OUR PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO UNANTICIPATED REGULATIONS AND RULES PROMULGATED FROM TIME TO TIME BY GOVERNMENT, NAMELY THOSE RELATED TO CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY WHICH MAY RENDER CERTAIN PRODUCTION METHODS, INGREDIENTS, PRODUCTS OR  PRACTICES OBSOLETE. THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS HAS POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE VIABILITY OR PROFITABILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS OR OPERATIONS.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RECRUIT OR RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND STOCK PRICE.  OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON THE CONTINUED SERVICES OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE KEY PERSON INSURANCE ON THESE INDIVIDUALS. THE LOSS OF THESE PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY WITHOUT ADVANCE NOTICE,  COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR STOCK PRICE. IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING TECHNICAL PERSONNEL, TO ACCOMMODATE OUR EXPLORATION PLANS AND  TO REPLACE PERSONNEL WHO LEAVE. COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL CAN BE INTENSE, AND THERE  ARE A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH THE REQUISITE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE. UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, WE COULD BE UNABLE TO RECRUIT, TRAIN, AND RETAIN EMPLOYEES. IF WE CANNOT ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE  IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND STOCK PRICE.  IF WE FAIL TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR GROWTH OUR FUTURE BUSINESS RESULTS COULD BE HARMED AND OUR MANAGERIAL AND OPERATIONAL RESOURCES MAY BE STRAINED.  AS WE PROCEED WITH OUR BUSINESS PLAN, WE EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT AND RAPID GROWTH IN THE SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY OF OUR BUSINESS. WE WILL NEED TO ADD STAFF TO MARKET OUR SERVICES, MANAGE OPERATIONS, HANDLE SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS AND  PERFORM FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING FUNCTIONS. WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO HIRE A BROAD RANGE OF ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY ADVANCE OUR OPERATIONS. THIS GROWTH IS LIKELY TO PLACE A STRAIN ON OUR MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONAL RESOURCES. THE  FAILURE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE SYSTEMS, OR TO HIRE AND RETAIN SUFFICIENT PERSONNEL FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ALL OF THE FUNCTIONS NECESSARY TO EFFECTIVELY SERVICE AND MANAGE OUR POTENTIAL BUSINESS, OR THE FAILURE TO MANAGE GROWTH  EFFECTIVELY, COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHARES OF OUR COMPANY  BECAUSE WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY ANY DIVIDENDS ON OUR SHARES, INVESTORS SEEKING DIVIDEND INCOME OR LIQUIDITY SHOULD NOT PURCHASE OUR SHARES.  WE HAVE NOT DECLARED OR PAID ANY DIVIDENDS ON OUR SHARES SINCE INCEPTION, AND DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING ANY SUCH DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE PRESENTLY DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL PAY DIVIDENDS ON ANY OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE  FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IF PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS DOES OCCUR AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE, IT WOULD BE CONTINGENT UPON OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS, IF ANY, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND GENERAL FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE PAYMENT OF ANY COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS WILL  BE WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. WE PRESENTLY INTEND TO RETAIN ALL EARNINGS TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN; ACCORDINGLY, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THE DECLARATION OF ANY DIVIDENDS FOR COMMON STOCK IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  INVESTORS SEEKING DIVIDEND INCOME OR LIQUIDITY SHOULD NOT INVEST IN OUR SHARES.  BECAUSE WE CAN ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES, PURCHASERS OF OUR SHARES MAY INCUR IMMEDIATE DILUTION AND MAY EXPERIENCE FURTHER DILUTION.  WE ARE AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE UP TO 200,000,000 SHARES. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF OUR COMPANY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CAUSE US TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES, AND TO DETERMINE THE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND PRIVILEGES OF SUCH SHARES, WITHOUT CONSENT OF ANY OF  OUR STOCKHOLDERS. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE MORE DILUTION IN THEIR OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMPANY IN THE FUTURE.  OTHER RISKS  TRADING ON THE OCTQB AND CSE MAY BE VOLATILE AND SPORADIC, WHICH COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS TO RESELL THEIR SHARES.  OUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON THE OTCQB ELECTRONIC QUOTATION SERVICE OPERATED BY OTC MARKETS GROUP INC.. TRADING IN STOCK QUOTED ON THE OTCQB IS OFTEN THIN AND CHARACTERIZED BY WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN TRADING PRICES, DUE TO MANY FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE  LITTLE TO DO WITH OUR OPERATIONS OR BUSINESS PROSPECTS. THIS VOLATILITY COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR REASONS UNRELATED TO OPERATING PERFORMANCE. MOREOVER, THE OTCQB IS NOT A STOCK EXCHANGE, AND TRADING OF SECURITIES ON THE  OTCQB IS OFTEN MORE SPORADIC THAN THE TRADING OF SECURITIES LISTED ON A QUOTATION SYSTEM LIKE NASDAQ OR A STOCK EXCHANGE LIKE AMEX. ACCORDINGLY, SHAREHOLDERS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY RESELLING ANY OF THE SHARES.  OUR STOCK IS A PENNY STOCK. TRADING OF OUR STOCK MAY BE RESTRICTED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\u2019S PENNY STOCK REGULATIONS WHICH MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER\u2019S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK.  OUR STOCK IS A PENNY STOCK. THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED RULE 15G-9 WHICH GENERALLY DEFINES \u201cPENNY STOCK\u201d TO BE ANY EQUITY SECURITY THAT HAS A MARKET PRICE (AS DEFINED) LESS THAN $5.00 PER SHARE OR AN EXERCISE  PRICE OF LESS THAN $5.00 PER SHARE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. OUR SECURITIES ARE COVERED BY THE PENNY STOCK RULES, WHICH IMPOSE ADDITIONAL SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS ON BROKER-DEALERS WHO SELL TO PERSONS OTHER THAN ESTABLISHED CUSTOMERS AND \u201cACCREDITED INVESTORS\u201d. THE TERM \u201cACCREDITED INVESTOR\u201d REFERS GENERALLY TO INSTITUTIONS WITH ASSETS IN EXCESS OF $5,000,000 OR INDIVIDUALS WITH A NET WORTH IN EXCESS OF $1,000,000 OR ANNUAL INCOME  EXCEEDING $200,000 OR $300,000 JOINTLY WITH THEIR SPOUSE. THE PENNY STOCK RULES REQUIRE A BROKER-DEALER, PRIOR TO A TRANSACTION IN A PENNY STOCK NOT OTHERWISE EXEMPT FROM THE RULES, TO DELIVER A STANDARDIZED RISK DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT IN A  FORM PREPARED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WHICH PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT PENNY STOCKS AND THE NATURE AND LEVEL OF RISKS IN THE PENNY STOCK MARKET. THE BROKER-DEALER ALSO MUST PROVIDE THE CUSTOMER WITH CURRENT BID AND OFFER QUOTATIONS  FOR THE PENNY STOCK, THE COMPENSATION OF THE BROKER-DEALER AND ITS SALESPERSON IN THE TRANSACTION AND MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENTS SHOWING THE MARKET VALUE OF EACH PENNY STOCK HELD IN THE CUSTOMER\u2019S ACCOUNT. THE BID AND OFFER QUOTATIONS, AND THE  BROKER-DEALER AND SALESPERSON COMPENSATION INFORMATION, MUST BE GIVEN TO THE CUSTOMER ORALLY OR IN WRITING PRIOR TO EFFECTING THE TRANSACTION AND MUST BE GIVEN TO THE CUSTOMER IN WRITING BEFORE OR WITH THE CUSTOMER\u2019S CONFIRMATION. IN ADDITION,  THE PENNY STOCK RULES REQUIRE THAT PRIOR TO A TRANSACTION IN A PENNY STOCK NOT OTHERWISE EXEMPT FROM THESE RULES, THE BROKER-DEALER MUST MAKE A SPECIAL WRITTEN DETERMINATION THAT THE PENNY STOCK IS A SUITABLE INVESTMENT FOR THE PURCHASER AND RECEIVE  THE PURCHASER\u2019S WRITTEN AGREEMENT TO THE TRANSACTION. THESE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE LEVEL OF TRADING ACTIVITY IN THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR THE STOCK THAT IS SUBJECT TO THESE PENNY STOCK RULES. CONSEQUENTLY,  THESE PENNY STOCK RULES MAY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF BROKER-DEALERS TO TRADE OUR SECURITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PENNY STOCK RULES DISCOURAGE INVESTOR INTEREST IN AND LIMIT THE MARKETABILITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY, OR FINRA, HAS ADOPTED SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS WHICH MAY ALSO LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER\u2019S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK.  IN ADDITION TO THE \u201cPENNY STOCK\u201d RULES DESCRIBED ABOVE, FINRA HAS ADOPTED RULES THAT REQUIRE THAT IN RECOMMENDING AN INVESTMENT TO A CUSTOMER, A BROKER-DEALER MUST HAVE REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR BELIEVING THAT THE INVESTMENT IS SUITABLE FOR  THAT CUSTOMER. PRIOR TO RECOMMENDING SPECULATIVE LOW PRICED SECURITIES TO THEIR NON-INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS, BROKER-DEALERS MUST MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE CUSTOMER\u2019S FINANCIAL STATUS, TAX STATUS, INVESTMENT  OBJECTIVES AND OTHER INFORMATION. UNDER INTERPRETATIONS OF THESE RULES, FINRA BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT SPECULATIVE LOW PRICED SECURITIES WILL NOT BE SUITABLE FOR AT LEAST SOME CUSTOMERS. FINRA REQUIREMENTS MAKE IT MORE  DIFFICULT FOR BROKER-DEALERS TO RECOMMEND THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS BUY OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH MAY LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET FOR OUR SHARES.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATIONS COMPLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, WITH ALL APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.  OUR OPERATING PARTNERS MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE CUSTOMARY TO THE INDUSTRY; HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT FULLY INSURED AGAINST ALL POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS.  ANY CHANGE TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION/ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE AND OUR PROFITABILITY.  THE LAWS, REGULATIONS, POLICIES OR CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES OF ANY GOVERNMENT BODY, ORGANIZATION OR REGULATORY AGENCY IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, MAY BE CHANGED, APPLIED OR INTERPRETED IN A MANNER WHICH WILL  FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE ABILITY OF OUR COMPANY TO CARRY ON OUR BUSINESS.  THE ACTIONS, POLICIES OR REGULATIONS, OR CHANGES THERETO, OF ANY GOVERNMENT BODY OR REGULATORY AGENCY, OR OTHER SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, MAY HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON US. ANY OR ALL OF THESE SITUATIONS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO  OPERATE AND/OR OUR PROFITABLY.  BECAUSE WE CAN ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES, PURCHASERS OF OUR SHARES MAY INCUR IMMEDIATE DILUTION AND MAY EXPERIENCE FURTHER DILUTION.  WE ARE AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE UP TO 200,000,000 SHARES. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF OUR COMPANY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CAUSE US TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES, AND TO DETERMINE THE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND PRIVILEGES OF SUCH SHARES, WITHOUT CONSENT OF ANY OF  OUR STOCKHOLDERS. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE MORE DILUTION IN THEIR OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMPANY IN THE FUTURE.  OUR BY-LAWS CONTAIN PROVISIONS INDEMNIFYING OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AGAINST ALL COSTS, CHARGES AND EXPENSES INCURRED BY THEM.  OUR BY-LAWS CONTAIN PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OF OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AGAINST ALL COSTS, CHARGES AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING AN AMOUNT PAID TO SETTLE AN ACTION OR SATISFY A JUDGMENT, ACTUALLY AND REASONABLY INCURRED BY HIM, INCLUDING AN AMOUNT PAID TO SETTLE AN ACTION  OR SATISFY A JUDGMENT IN A CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION OR  PROCEEDING TO WHICH HE IS MADE A PARTY BY REASON OF HIS BEING OR HAVING BEEN ONE  OF OUR DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS.  INVESTORS\u2019 INTERESTS IN OUR COMPANY WILL BE DILUTED AND  INVESTORS MAY SUFFER DILUTION IN THEIR NET BOOK VALUE PER SHARE IF WE ISSUE  ADDITIONAL SHARES OR RAISE FUNDS THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES.  OUR CONSTATING DOCUMENTS AUTHORIZE THE ISSUANCE OF 200,000,000  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WITH A PAR VALUE OF $0.001. IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE  REQUIRED TO ISSUE ANY ADDITIONAL SHARES OR ENTER INTO PRIVATE PLACEMENTS TO  RAISE FINANCING THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, INVESTORS\u201d INTERESTS IN  OUR COMPANY WILL BE DILUTED AND INVESTORS MAY SUFFER DILUTION IN THEIR NET BOOK  VALUE PER SHARE DEPENDING ON THE PRICE AT WHICH SUCH SECURITIES ARE SOLD. IF WE  ISSUE ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL SHARES, SUCH ISSUANCES ALSO WILL CAUSE A REDUCTION IN  THE PROPORTIONATE OWNERSHIP AND VOTING POWER OF ALL OTHER SHAREHOLDERS. FURTHER,  ANY SUCH ISSUANCE MAY RESULT IN A CHANGE IN OUR CONTROL.  OUR BY-LAWS DO NOT CONTAIN ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS, WHICH  COULD RESULT IN A CHANGE OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS IF THERE IS A TAKE-OVER  OF OUR COMPANY.  WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN OR ANY  ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN OUR BY-LAWS. WITHOUT ANY ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS,  THERE IS NO DETERRENT FOR A TAKE-OVER OF OUR COMPANY, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A  CHANGE IN OUR MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS.  AS A RESULT OF A MAJORITY OF OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS ARE  RESIDENTS OF OTHER COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES, INVESTORS MAY FIND IT  DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE, WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, ANY JUDGMENTS OBTAINED AGAINST  OUR COMPANY OR OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.  OTHER THAN OUR OPERATIONS OFFICE IN KELOWNA, BRITISH COLUMBIA,  WE DO NOT CURRENTLY MAINTAIN A PERMANENT PLACE OF BUSINESS WITHIN THE UNITED  STATES. IN ADDITION, A MAJORITY OF OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS ARE NATIONALS  AND/OR RESIDENTS OF COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES, AND ALL OR A  SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF SUCH PERSONS\u201d ASSETS ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED  STATES. AS A RESULT, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO ENFORCE WITHIN THE  UNITED STATES ANY JUDGMENTS OBTAINED AGAINST OUR COMPANY OR OUR OFFICERS OR  DIRECTORS, INCLUDING JUDGMENTS PREDICATED UPON THE CIVIL LIABILITY PROVISIONS OF  THE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OR ANY STATE THEREOF.  TRENDS, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.  WE HAVE SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST  SIGNIFICANT RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS, BUT WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER, OR TO WHAT  EXTENT, ANY OF SUCH RISKS MAY BE REALIZED NOR CAN WE GUARANTEE THAT WE HAVE  IDENTIFIED ALL POSSIBLE RISKS THAT MIGHT ARISE SUCH AS A BLACK SWAN EVENT. AN  ABSOLUTE WORST CASE SCENARIO WITH SUFFICIENT POTENTIAL IMPACT TO RISK THE FUTURE  OF THE COMPANY AS AN INDEPENDENT BUSINESS OPERATING IN ITS CHOSEN MARKETS.  SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL IMPACT AS A RESULT OF A MAJOR ISSUE RESULTING IN  MULTIPLE FATALITIES, POSSIBLY COMPOUNDED BY APPARENTLY NEGLIGENT MANAGEMENT  BEHAVIOR; EXTREME ADVERSE PRESS COVERAGE AND VIRAL SOCIAL MEDIA LINKING THE  COMPANY NAME TO CONSUMER BRANDS, LEADS TO A CATASTROPHIC SHARE PRICE FALL, VERY  SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND INABILITY TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT  QUALITY PEOPLE. INVESTORS SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER ALL OF SUCH RISK FACTORS  BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION WITH RESPECT TO OUR COMMON SHARES.  ITEM 2.

GENERAL AND HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS  THE COMPANY WAS FORMED ON DECEMBER 9, 2004 UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEVADA AS AN INDEPENDENT OIL AND GAS COMPANY ENGAGED IN THE EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. IN MARCH OF 2014, THE COMPANY BEGAN ITS ENTRY INTO THE BIOSCIENCE AND ALTERNATIVE HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS AND DISCONTINUED ITS INVOLVEMENT IN THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS IN NOVEMBER 2014. IN MAY 2016, THE COMPANY ALSO COMMENCED OUT-LICENSING ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY (THE \u201cTECHNOLOGY\u201d) FOR IMPROVED DELIVERY OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS THAT PROMOTES HEALTHY INGESTION METHODS, LOWER OVERALL DOSING AND HIGHER EFFECTIVENESS IN ACTIVE MOLECULE DELIVERY. THE COMPANY HAS ITS OFFICE IN KELOWNA, BC, CANADA.  EFFECTIVE AT THE OPENING OF TRADING ON OCTOBER 28, 2009, OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK BEGAN TRADING ON THE CANADIAN SECURITIES EXCHANGE (FORMERLY, CANADIAN NATIONAL STOCK EXCHANGE) UNDER THE TRADING SYMBOL \u201cLXX\u201d.  OUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON THE OTCQX UNDER THE SYMBOL \"LXRP\" AND ON THE CANADIAN SECURITIES EXCHANGE UNDER THE SYMBOL \u201cLXX\u201d.  PAGE 21 OF 49  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN 2014, THE COMPANY SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION TO ENTER THE LEGAL MEDICAL MARIJUANA BUSINESS IN CANADA AND ALSO LAUNCHED A HEMP OIL-BASED FOOD SUPPLEMENT COMPANY IN THE USA.  THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT WITH ENERTOPIA CORP FOR A PROSPECTIVE MEDICAL MARIJUANA BUSINESS UNDER THE CANADIAN MARIJUANA FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES REGULATIONS (\u201cMMPR\u201d) FOR A 49% NET OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS (ENERTOPIA 51%) UTILIZING AN IDENTIFIED LOCATION IN BURLINGTON, ONTARIO (THE \u201cBURLINGTON JOINT VENTURE\u201d).  ON JUNE 26, 2015, WE ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH ENERTOPIA CORP. AND SHAXON ENTERPRISES LTD. TO SELL OUR 49% INTEREST IN THE BURLINGTON JOINT VENTURE AND THE MMPR APPLICATION NUMBER 10MMPR0610. PURSUANT TO THE SALE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, THE JOINT VENTURE RECEIVED A NON-REFUNDABLE $10,000 DEPOSIT AND IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE UP TO $1,500,000 IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS UPON THE BURLINGTON FACILITY BECOMING LICENSED UNDER THE MMPR. ALL PAYMENTS MADE PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT WOULD BE DIVIDED 51% TO ENERTOPIA CORP. AND 49% TO OUR COMPANY. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE GRANT OF A PRODUCTION LICENSE FOR THE BURLINGTON FACILITY.  THE COMPANY\u2019S FOOD SCIENCES ACTIVITIES INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PROPRIETARY NUTRIENT INFUSION TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FUNCTIONAL FOODS, AND THE PRODUCTION OF ENHANCED FOOD PRODUCTS UNDER OUR CONSUMER PRODUCT BRANDS, VIPOVATM, LEXARIA ENERGYTM, TURBOCBDTM AND CHRGD+TM. THE COMPANY\u2019S PATENTED LIPID NUTRIENT INFUSION DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY IS BELIEVED TO IMPROVE TASTE, RAPIDITY AND DELIVERY OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS THAT INCLUDE CANNABINOIDS, VITAMINS, NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDS), NICOTINE AND OTHER MOLECULES COMPARED TO WHAT IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT LIPOPHILIC ENHANCEMENT TECHNOLOGY. THIS CAN ALLOW FOR LOWER OVERALL DOSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR HIGHER EFFECTIVENESS IN ACTIVE MOLECULE DELIVERY.  WE BEGAN FILING PATENT APPLICATIONS ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DURING 2015 THROUGH THE US PATENT OFFICE (USPTO), AND ALSO INTERNATIONALLY UNDER THE PATENT COOPERATION TREATY (PCT). WE WERE GRANTED OUR FIRST PATENT IN OCTOBER OF 2016 AND TO DATE HAVE BEEN GRANTED SIX PATENTS THROUGH THE USPTO AND FIVE IN AUSTRALIA.  LEXARIA HOPES TO REDUCE OTHER COMMON BUT LESS HEALTHY ADMINISTRATION METHODS, SUCH AS SMOKING, AS IT EMBRACES THE BENEFITS OF ITS TECHNOLOGY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. THE COMPANY IS AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING PATENT PROTECTION IN NATIONAL JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD.

DURING THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2019, AND UP TO THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, WE EXPERIENCED THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS.  ON SEPTEMBER 7, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ADDITIONS TO ITS PATENT PORTFOLIO WITH THREE NEW AUSTRALIAN PATENTS GRANTED TO LEXARIA BY THE AUSTRALIAN PATENT OFFICE. THE THREE AUSTRALIAN PATENTS ARE PROJECTED TO EXPIRE ON JUNE 10, 2035.  THE US PATENT & TRADEMARK OFFICE ALSO ISSUED TWO NEW NOTICES OF ALLOWANCE FOR PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS AND THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE GRANTS ON OCTOBER 16, 2018. THE TWO NEW PATENTS ARE RELATED TO CERTAIN CANNABINOID INFUSED BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS UTILIZING LEXARIA\u2019S PROPRIETARY DEHYDRATECH PROCESS. NEWLY GRANTED PATENT NUMBERS US 10,103,225 B2 AND US 10,084,044 B2 PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR COMPOSITIONS AS WELL AS METHODS FOR MAKING THE COMPOSITIONS, EACH OF WHICH INCLUDE THE USE OF BOTH NON-PSYCHOACTIVE CANNABINOIDS SUCH AS CBD AND ALSO PSYCHOACTIVE CANNABINOIDS SUCH AS THC. THE COMPANY HOLDS ELEVEN ISSUED PATENTS WITHIN ITS FIRST PATENT FAMILY, \u201cFOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS INFUSED WITH LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\u201d THAT SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHEN LEXARIA\u2019S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS IN THE US AND AUSTRALIA. WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE CLAIMS IN CORRESPONDING PENDING APPLICATIONS WITHIN THIS FIRST PATENT FAMILY AROUND THE WORLD.  PAGE 23 OF 49  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON SEPTEMBER 7, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE FILING OF A NEW STRATEGIC PATENT APPLICATION. THE NEW PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION IS ENTITLED \u201cLIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENT INFUSED TOBACCO LEAVES AND/OR TOBACCO MATERIALS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\u201d. THIS APPLICATION REPRESENTS LEXARIA\u2019S TENTH PATENT FAMILY AND EXPANDS THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ALREADY-PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  PROCESS TO IMPART BENEFITS TO TOBACCO LEAVES THAT MAY BE UTILIZED TO DELIVER COMPOUNDS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT INCLUDE NICOTINE.  LEXARIA ALSO ANNOUNCED IT CANCELLED THE CONTRACT ANNOUNCED ON APRIL 25, 2018 WITH GP HOLDINGS LLC DUE TO ONGOING DELAYS AND NON-PERFORMANCE.  ON OCTOBER 10, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT HAS COMPLETED THE CREATION OF FOUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES. THIS NEW CORPORATE STRUCTURE MORE SUITABLY REFLECTS THE DISTINCT CUSTOMER BASES AND BUSINESS APPLICATIONS FOR EACH SUBSIDIARY, THEREBY ALLOWING THE COMPANY TO FOCUS ITS FUTURE RESEARCH AND CONSIDER FINANCING STRUCTURES AND INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS SPECIFICALLY OPTIMIZED TO EACH.  \u00b7  LEXARIA CANPHARM CORP., A CANADIAN COMPANY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER ENHANCEMENTS TO THE GLOBAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY.  \u00b7  LEXARIA NICOTINE CORP., A US COMPANY WITH A GLOBAL LICENSE TO PROVIDE DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY TO THE GLOBAL NICOTINE AND TOBACCO INDUSTRIES.  \u00b7  LEXARIA HEMP CORP., A US COMPANY GLOBALLY LICENSED TO PROVIDE DEHYDRATECH TO THE RAPIDLY GROWING HEMP-BASED FOODS AND SUPPLEMENTS INDUSTRIES.  \u00b7  LEXARIA PHARMACEUTICAL CORP., A US COMPANY GLOBALLY EMPOWERED TO LICENSE DEHYDRATECH TO THE LARGE AND DIVERSE PHARMACEUTICAL SECTORS.  ON OCTOBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY CLOSED A NON-BROKERED PRIVATE PLACEMENT FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF $1,515,440 (THE \u201cOFFERING\u201d). THE OFFERING CONSISTED OF 947,150 UNITS (EACH, A \u201cUNIT\u201d) AT AN ISSUE PRICE OF $1.60 PER UNIT. EACH UNIT CONSISTS OF ONE COMMON SHARE OF THE COMPANY (A \u201cSHARE\u201d) AND ONE COMMON SHARE PURCHASE WARRANT (EACH, A \u201cWARRANT\u201d). EACH WARRANT ENTITLES THE HOLDER TO ACQUIRE ONE COMMON SHARE OF THE COMPANY AT A PRICE OF $2.25 PER COMMON SHARE FOR A PERIOD OF 24 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE OFFERING. FINDER\u2019S FEES OF $45,080 AND 28,175 FINDER\u2019S WARRANTS WERE PAID ON A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS RAISED, WITH EACH FINDER\u2019S WARRANT HAVING EXERCISE TERMS IDENTICAL TO THE WARRANTS ISSUED. THE WARRANTS WERE VALUED AT $16,095, WHICH WERE RECORDED AS A SHARE ISSUE COST WITHIN ADDITIONAL PAID IN CAPITAL FOR A NET EFFECT OF $NIL.  ON NOVEMBER 13, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE LAUNCH OF CHRGD+, A WATER-SOLUBLE, READY-MIX HEMP SUPPLEMENT POWDER PACKET FORMULATION DESIGNED TO BE ADDED TO ANY DRINK. LEXARIA ENGAGED CULTIVATING WELLNESS INC., A CALIFORNIA-BASED BRAND DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANY, TO CREATE THE CHRGD+ PREMIUM BRAND. CULTIVATING WELLNESS\u2019 DISTRIBUTION NETWORK REACHES TENS OF THOUSANDS OF RETAIL BUYERS IN C-STORES, GROCERY CHAINS, SPECIALTY RETAIL, AND NATIONAL ACCOUNTS.  ON NOVEMBER 26, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT SUBMITTED A RESEARCH APPLICATION UNDER HEALTH CANADA\u2019S CANNABIS TRACKING AND LICENSING SYSTEM FOR THE OPERATION OF A KELOWNA-BASED R&D LABORATORY WITHIN LEXARIA\u2019S NEW HEAD OFFICE. THE LABORATORY WILL ENHANCE LEXARIA\u2019S ABILITY TO FORMULATE FOR ANALYTICAL PURPOSES, VARIOUS PRODUCTS THAT MAY CONTAIN CANNABINOIDS OR OTHER CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. LEXARIA EXPECTS TO WORK ON CANNABINOID RELATED FORMULATIONS AS SOON AS THE LAB RECEIVES ITS RESEARCH LICENSE TO DO SO. EXPERIMENTAL WORK ON NICOTINE FORMULATIONS, NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS, VITAMINS AND OTHER BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS OF INTEREST WILL ALSO BEGIN SOON AFTER COMPLETION OF LAB CONSTRUCTION. BRINGING THIS WORK IN-HOUSE IS EXPECTED TO ENABLE THE COMPANY TO EXPAND ITS WORK SCHEDULES WHILE REDUCING COSTS AND DEVELOPMENT TIMELINES. LEXARIA ALSO APPOINTED DR. ED ERGENZINGER TO ITS EXECUTIVE TEAM AS CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER AND SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF INNOVATION FOR THE COMPANY. DR. ERGENZINGER IS A U.S. LICENSED PATENT ATTORNEY WHO ALSO HOLDS A DOCTORATE IN NEUROSCIENCE (WITH CONCENTRATIONS IN PHARMACOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY) AND IS AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR OF LAW.  PAGE 24 OF 49  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON DECEMBER 7, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT HIRED ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL INCLUDING A NEW CORPORATE CONTROLLER; HEAD OF LEGAL DIVISION AND OTHER OFFICE STAFF. AS A RESULT OF THE POSITIONS CREATED, LEXARIA ISSUED 240,000 STOCK OPTIONS WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $1.06, THAT VEST 80,000 PER YEAR UNTIL APRIL 15, 2021 AND 30,000 OPTIONS WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $1.16 THAT VEST 10,000 PER YEAR UNTIL APRIL 15, 2021.  ON JANUARY 15, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY LEXARIA NICOTINE LLC (\u201cLEXARIA NICOTINE\u201d) AND ALTRIA VENTURES INC., AN INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF ALTRIA GROUP, INC. (\u201cALTRIA\u201d), EXECUTED DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS TO PURSUE INNOVATION IN ORAL, REDUCED RISK NICOTINE CONSUMER PRODUCTS USING LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY. ALTRIA IS FUNDING A MILESTONE-BASED RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (\u201cR&D PROGRAM\u201d) IN EXCHANGE FOR A MINORITY EQUITY INTEREST IN LEXARIA NICOTINE AND CERTAIN DEHYDRATECH LICENSE RIGHTS. ALTRIA WILL PROVIDE INITIAL FUNDING OF $1 MILLION, WITH THE OPTION FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING OF UP TO $12 MILLION THROUGH MULTIPLE PHASED PRIVATE FINANCINGS. ALTRIA WAS GRANTED A LICENSE TO USE LEXARIA BIOSCIENCE\u2019S DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY FOR ORAL NICOTINE DELIVERY FORMS ON AN EXCLUSIVE BASIS IN THE UNITED STATES AND A NON-EXCLUSIVE BASIS ELSEWHERE GLOBALLY. ALTRIA WILL PAY LEXARIA NICOTINE A ROYALTY ON REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE SALE OF NICOTINE PRODUCTS CONTAINING DEHYDRATECH, UNTIL SUCH TIME IT MAY ACQUIRE 100% OWNERSHIP IN LEXARIA NICOTINE. ALTRIA WILL INITIALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPOINT ONE OF THE SEVEN DIRECTORS ON LEXARIA NICOTINE\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND, THROUGH THE ADDITIONAL PHASED INVESTMENTS, MAY HAVE THE RIGHT TO APPOINT UP TO THREE OF THE SEVEN DIRECTORS. ALTRIA HAS THE OPTION TO ACQUIRE 100% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN LEXARIA NICOTINE COMMENSURATE WITH THEN-CURRENT FAIR MARKET VALUE.  ON FEBRUARY 21, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ADDITIONAL FINDINGS UPON COMPLETION OF FURTHER DATA ANALYSES FROM ITS 2018 RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, DOUBLE-BLINDED EUROPEAN HUMAN CLINICAL STUDY THAT EVALUATED TURBOCBDTM, THE COMPANY\u2019S PROPRIETARY, DEHYDRATECHTM POWERED, CANNABIDIOL (\u201cCBD\u201d) FORTIFIED HEMP-OIL CAPSULE. A SINGLE 90MG DOSE OF TURBOCBD PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE; HIGHER BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN; FASTER DELIVERY ONSET OF CBD INTO THE BLOODSTREAM; AND, LARGER QUANTITIES OF CBD WITHIN THE BLOOD COMPARED TO A SINGLE 90MG DOSE OF GENERIC CBD.  KEY METABOLIC AND HEMODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE FINDINGS LINKED TO BIOAVAILABILITY ENHANCEMENTS WERE REVEALED IN THE STUDY, WHICH COMPARED A 90 MG DOSE OF LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM TO A 90 MG DOSE WITHOUT LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY (THE \u201cPOSITIVE CONTROL\u201d) AS WELL AS A PLACEBO, AS FOLLOWS.  \u00b7  ANALYSIS OF MEAN ARTERIAL BLOOD PRESSURE (MAP) AT PEAK BLOOD LEVELS OF CBD ACHIEVED WITH LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN MAP COMPARED TO PLACEBO (95% CI; P=0.027). THIS FINDING WAS NOT OBSERVED WITH THE DOSE-MATCHED POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION FOR WHICH THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN MAP COMPARED TO PLACEBO (95% CI; P=0.625);  \u00b7  CEREBRAL PERFUSION WAS ALSO ANALYSED BY AN INDEX OF CONDUCTANCE IN THE MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY (MCA). THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM CAUSED THE GREATEST INCREASE IN MCA CONDUCTANCE RELATIVE TO BOTH THE POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION AND PLACEBO (95% CI; P=0.017 AND P=0.002 RESPECTIVELY);  FINALLY, OVER THE SIX-HOUR STUDY, ANALYSIS OF THE TOTAL AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) DEMONSTRATED THAT LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM RESULTED IN A NOTABLE TREND FOR HIGHER LEVELS OF CBD IN THE BLOODSTREAM OVERALL THAN THE POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION WITH TOTAL AUC OF 10,865 \u00b1 6,322 OBSERVED WITH LEXARIA\u2019S FORMULATION COMPARED TO 7,115 \u00b1 2,978 OBSERVED WITH THE POSITIVE CONTROL (95% CI; P=0.096). FURTHERMORE, WHEN NORMALIZED TO BODY MASS, THE AUC AT THE PEAK CBD CONCENTRATION WAS MARKEDLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY (95% CI; P=0.02) HIGHER WITH THE TURBOCBDTM 90 MG DOSE COMPARED TO THE 90 MG DOSE POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION.  ON MARCH 20, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED AN IN VIVO RESEARCH PROGRAM TO TEST LEXARIA DESIGNED NANOTECH ENHANCEMENTS COMPRISED OF ELEVEN SEPARATE ANIMAL STUDIES. LEXARIA ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT, EFFECTIVE MARCH 15, 2019, IT TERMINATED THE DEFINITIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN LEXARIA CANPHARM ULC AND NEUTRISCI INTERNATIONAL INC. THAT WAS ORIGINALLY ANNOUNCED ON FEBRUARY 26, 2018.  ON APRIL 9, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT NEGOTIATED 3-YEAR TERM RENEWAL MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS WITH CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHRIS BUNKA AND PRESIDENT JOHN DOCHERTY. THE ANNUAL COMPENSATION PAYABLE IS CDN$350,000 WITH RESPECT TO OUR CEO AND CDN$300,000 WITH RESPECT TO OUR PRESIDENT, WITH SUCH CONTRACTS CONTEMPLATING PERFORMANCE-RELATED BONUSES.  PAGE 25 OF 49  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON APRIL 24, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE 5-YEAR AGREEMENT, VIA ITS SUBSIDIARY LEXARIA CANPHARM ULC, TO PROVIDE LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY TO A PRIVATE CALIFORNIA-BASED COMPANY FOR ITS UTILIZATION IN CERTAIN CBD-BASED BEVERAGES TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA THAT MAY INCLUDE ANY COMBINATION OF READY-TO-DRINK BEVERAGES SUCH AS NON-ALCOHOLIC BEERS, WINES AND SPIRITS; COLD OR HOT COFFEE OR TEAS, SPORTS DRINKS AND MORE.  ON MAY 7, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE 5-YEAR AGREEMENT, VIA ITS SUBSIDIARY LEXARIA HEMP CORP., TO PROVIDE LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY TO A PRIVATE NEVADA-BASED COMPANY FOR ITS UTILIZATION IN CERTAIN CBD-BASED BEVERAGES TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD ACROSS THE USA THAT MAY INCLUDE ANY COMBINATION OF READY-TO-DRINK BEVERAGES SUCH AS NON-ALCOHOLIC BEERS, WINES AND SPIRITS; COLD OR HOT COFFEE OR TEAS, SPORTS DRINKS AND MORE.  ON MAY 15, 2019, THE COMPANY RELEASED INITIAL RESULTS FROM ITS RESEARCH PROGRAM ANNOUNCED MARCH 2019 DEMONSTRATING MEASURABLE QUANTITIES OF CANNABIDIOL INTO BLOOD IN AS LITTLE AS 2 MINUTES. IN EACH ARM OF THE LEXARIA ANIMAL STUDIES, 10 MALE SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS WERE ADMINISTERED CBD AT 25MG PER KG OF BODYWEIGHT. DELIVERY OF CBD INTO THE BLOODSTREAM WAS MONITORED OVER A 60-MINUTE DURATION. IN THE FIRST ANIMAL STUDY RESULTS, LEXARIA COMPARED ITS STANDARD DEHYDRATECH FORMULATION THAT COMBINES CANNABINOIDS WITH LONG-CHAIN FATTY ACIDS (\u201cLCFA\u201d) USING LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATION PROCESSING TECHNIQUE TO A CONCENTRATION-MATCHED FORMULATION UTILIZING COCONUT OIL WHICH IS A COMMONLY USED MEDIUM CHAIN TRIGLYCERIDE (\u201cMCT\u201d) OIL IN THE CANNABIS EDIBLES INDUSTRY.  \u00b7  AT 2 MINUTES DEHYDRATECH\u2019S LCFA FORMULATION DELIVERED MEASURABLE CBD IN BLOOD, COMPARED TO NO MEASURABLE CBD IN BLOOD UNTIL 6 MINUTES AND ONWARDS FOR THE MCT OIL FORMULATION.  \u00b7  AT 15 MINUTES DEHYDRATECH\u2019S LCFA FORMULATION ACHIEVED A CBD BLOOD CONCENTRATION LEVEL THAT WAS 475% MORE THAN THE MCT OIL FORMULATION; AND, THE DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION CBD BLOOD LEVELS REACHED AT 15 MINUTES WERE GREATER THAN THE CBD BLOOD LEVELS REACHED BY THE MCT OIL FORMULATION AT ANY TIME POINT DURING THE 60-MINUTE EVALUATION.  \u00b7  AT 60 MINUTES DEHYDRATECH\u2019S LCFA FORMULATION ACHIEVED A CBD BLOOD CONCENTRATION LEVEL OF 319% MORE THAN THE MCT OIL FORMULATION.  \u00b7  OVER THE ENTIRE 60-MINUTE STUDY, THE ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED THE STANDARD DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE MAXIMUM CBD BLOOD CONCENTRATION LEVEL THAT WAS 334% MORE THAN THE AVERAGE MAXIMUM BLOOD CONCENTRATION LEVEL OF THE ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED THE MCT OIL FORMULATION (P<0.0021).  \u00b7  OVER THE ENTIRE 60-MINUTE STUDY, THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) (TOTAL QUANTITY OF CBD DELIVERED) FOR THE LEXARIA DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION WAS 389% MORE THAN THE MCT OIL FORMULATION (P<0.0011).  LEXARIA ALSO TESTED FOR BRAIN TISSUE CONCENTRATIONS TO QUANTIFY 8-HOUR CBD DELIVERY FROM THE DEHYDRATECH-ENABLED LCFA FORMULATION COMPARED TO THE MCT OIL FORMULATION AND DEHYDRATECH\u2019S LCFA FORMULATION OUTPERFORMED THE MCT OIL FORMULATION BY 246%.  ON MAY 21, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A MAJOR EXPANSION IN OPERATIONS BY NUKA ENTERPRISES LLC, (\u201cNUKA\u201d) MAKER OF 1906 EDIBLES OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS INTO ILLINOIS, OHIO, MASSACHUSETTS, MICHIGAN AND OTHER STATES. THE COMPREHENSIVE SEMI-EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT PROVIDES NUKA AND 1906 WITH COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES UNTIL 2028. A SECOND LICENSE PROVIDES NUKA AND 1906 WITH THE IMMEDIATE ABILITY TO UTILIZE DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY FOR CBD ACROSS THE US MARKETPLACE.  ON MAY 28, 2019, THE COMPANY RELEASED ADDITIONAL RESULTS FROM ITS RESEARCH PROGRAM WHEREIN ANIMAL TESTING PROVED THAT COMBINING LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY WITH GENERIC NANOTECH TECHNIQUES DELIVERS 1,137% MORE CANNABIDIOL INTO ANIMAL BRAIN TISSUE FOLLOWING ORAL INGESTION THAN CERTAIN EXISTING INDUSTRY FORMULATIONS. LEXARIA COMBINED ITS DEHYDRATECH DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY WITH A STANDARD FORM OF NANOTECHNOLOGY AND ANALYZED SUBSEQUENT DELIVERY INTO BRAIN TISSUE FOLLOWING ORAL INGESTION. IN EACH ARM OF THE LEXARIA ANIMAL STUDIES, 10 MALE SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS WERE ORALLY ADMINISTERED CBD AT THE RATE OF 25MG PER KG OF BODYWEIGHT. DELIVERY OF CBD INTO THE BRAIN WAS REPORTED 8 HOURS AFTER DOSING.  PAGE 26 OF 49  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u00b7  THE LEXARIA DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION  WITHOUT  NANOTECH ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE BRAIN TISSUE ACCUMULATION LEVEL THAT WAS 246% HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE FOR THOSE ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED THE MCT OIL FORMULATION (P=0.0013).  \u00b7  THE LEXARIA DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION WITH NANOTECH ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE BRAIN TISSUE ACCUMULATION LEVEL THAT WAS 1,137% HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE FOR THOSE ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED THE MCT OIL FORMULATION (P=0.0178).

FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY  LEXARIA IS A BIOTECHNOLOGY AND FOOD SCIENCE COMPANY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING AND OUT-LICENSING ITS PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY FOR IMPROVED TASTE, RAPIDITY, AND DELIVERY OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN FOODS AND OTHER INGESTIBLE PRODUCTS LEXARIA IS FOCUSING ITS CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT TIME ON ITS PURSUIT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, TECHNOLOGY LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES, AN EXPANDING PORTFOLIO OF PATENT PENDING APPLICATIONS, AND FUNCTIONAL FOOD AND SUPPLEMENT FORMULATIONS.  ON NOVEMBER 11, 2014, OUR COMPANY ACQUIRED 51% OF POVIVA TEA LLC AND EXECUTED AN OPERATING AGREEMENT TO DEVELOP A BUSINESS OF LEGALLY PRODUCING, MANUFACTURING, IMPORTING/EXPORTING, TESTING, RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING, A LINE OF HEMP OIL WITH CANNABIDIOL-INFUSED TEAS, DRINKS AND FOODS. LEXARIA OVERSEES ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRODUCTION, PRODUCT QUALITY, LICENSING, TESTING, PRODUCT LEGALITY, ACCOUNTING, MARKETING, CAPITAL INVESTMENT, CAPITAL RAISING, SALES, BRANDING, ADVERTISING AND FULFILLMENT. ON NOVEMBER 2, 2017, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE ACQUIRED 100% OF POVIVA TEA LLC.  THE COMPANY INTRODUCED AN EXPANDING VARIETY OF HEMP FORTIFIED CONSUMER FOOD PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT 2015 TO DEMONSTRATE LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY TO BOTH CONSUMERS AND POTENTIAL LICENSEES. FROM JANUARY 2015 TO DECEMBER 2015, SEVEN (7) FLAVORS OF TEAS; HOT CHOCOLATE; COFFEE, AND TWO (2) FLAVORS OF PROTEIN ENERGY BARS WERE INTRODUCED \u2013 ALL UTILIZING LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED TECHNOLOGY DEHYDRATECH FOR THE MORE PALATABLE AND EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF BIOACTIVE MOLECULES INFUSED WITHIN THOSE FOOD PRODUCTS.  IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE PRODUCTS, FOR EACH RAW MATERIAL TO BE USED IN VIPOVATM -BRANDED PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY ASSESSES IF THE PRODUCT INPUTS AND THE COMPLETED PRODUCTS COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE FOOD AND DRUG LAWS, AND THAT THE INPUTS AND THE FINISHED PRODUCTS MEET ALL APPLICABLE LEGAL AND QUALITY STANDARDS INCLUDING AND AS IT RELATES TO HEMP OIL CONTENT; THC CONTENT; MOLDS AND MILDEWS; HEAVY METALS; AND MAY MEASURE ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS.  THE US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, OWNS US PATENT #6630507, WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS, CLAIMS THAT  PAGE 27 OF 49  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u201c  CANNABINOIDS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO HAVE ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES, UNRELATED TO NMDA RECEPTOR ANTAGONISM. THIS NEW FOUND PROPERTY MAKES CANNABINOIDS USEFUL IN THE TREATMENT AND PROPHYLAXIS OF WIDE VARIETY OF OXIDATION ASSOCIATED DISEASES, SUCH AS ISCHEMIC, AGE-RELATED, INFLAMMATORY AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. THE CANNABINOIDS ARE FOUND TO HAVE PARTICULAR APPLICATION AS NEUROPROTECTANTS, FOR EXAMPLE IN LIMITING NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE FOLLOWING ISCHEMIC INSULTS, SUCH AS STROKE AND TRAUMA, OR IN THE TREATMENT OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES, SUCH AS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND HIV DEMENTIA.\u201d  FOR REFERENCE, CANNABINOIDS ARE COMPOUNDS THAT AFFECT CANNABINOID RECEPTORS LOCATED ON MANY HUMAN CELLS. CB1 RECEPTORS ARE WIDELY FOUND WITHIN THE HUMAN BRAIN; AND CB2 RECEPTORS ARE FOUND WITH THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM AND HAVE BEEN LINKED TO ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND OTHER RESPONSES.  DESPITE INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS IN MANY LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, SOME REGULATORY AGENCIES DO NOT OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZE THAT A HUMAN ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM EXISTS.  OVER ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT CANNABINOIDS HAVE BEEN ISOLATED FROM THE CANNABIS PLANT, MOST OF WHICH DO NOT HAVE PSYCHOACTIVE PROPERTIES. ONE THAT DOES HAVE PSYCHOACTIVE PROPERTIES IS TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL (THC). ENDOCANNABINOIDS ARE PRODUCED NATURALLY IN THE HUMAN BODY WHILE PHYTOCANNABINOIDS ARE PRODUCED IN SEVERAL PLANT SPECIES, MOST ABUNDANTLY IN THE CANNABIS PLANT.  CANNABIDIOL (\u201cCBD\u201d) IS ONE OF THE MAJOR PHYTOCANNABINOID FORMS OF CANNABINOIDS AND IS NOT PSYCHOACTIVE, OFTEN CONTRIBUTING MORE THAN 35% OF THE EXTRACTS FROM THE CANNABIS PLANT RESIN. CANNABIDIOL OCCURS NATURALLY IN OTHER PLANT SPECIES BEYOND CANNABIS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MOST WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF PHYTOCANNABINOID IS IN THE BETTER UNDERSTOOD ECHINACEA SPECIES, IN WIDESPREAD USE AS A DIETARY SUPPLEMENT. MOST PHYTOCANNABINOIDS ARE VIRTUALLY INSOLUBLE IN WATER BUT ARE SOLUBLE IN LIPIDS AND ALCOHOL. THE WORLD ANTI DOPING AGENCY (\u201cWADA\u201d) HAS EXEMPTED CBD FROM ITS 2018 LIST OF BANNED SUBSTANCES.  THE ALTERNATIVE HEALTH SECTOR IS LARGE AND GROWING. A LONG-TERM MEDICAL EXPENDITURE PANEL SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED FROM 2002 UNTIL 2008 WITH AT LEAST 29,370 SUBJECTS ASKED REPEATEDLY IF THEY HAD SEEN ANY KIND OF HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER IN THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS. THE SURVEY RECORDED WHETHER THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WAS A \u201cCOMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE CARE PROFESSIONAL,\u201d INCLUDING \u201cHOMEOPATHIC, NATUROPATHIC, OR HERBALIST.\u201d  BETWEEN 5.3% AND 5.8% OF THE SURVEY GROUP AT ANY ONE TIME REPORTED THAT THEY HAD SEEN A COMPLEMENTARY OR ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE PROVIDER. BASED ON THE US POPULATION OF ~328,000,000, THIS SUGGESTS BETWEEN 17.4 MILLION AND 19.0 MILLION AMERICANS ARE SEEKING AN ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL AT ANY GIVEN TIME.  MEANWHILE THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, IN AN APRIL 2011 NCHS DATA BRIEF, REPORTED THAT MORE THAN 50% OF THE POPULATION USES DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER. DETAILED FINDINGS FROM THAT REPORT INCLUDED.  \u00b7  USE OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS IS COMMON AMONG THE U.S. ADULT POPULATION. OVER 40% USED SUPPLEMENTS IN 1988\u20131994, AND OVER ONE-HALF IN 2003\u20132006.  \u00b7  MULTIVITAMINS/MULTIMINERALS ARE THE MOST COMMONLY USED DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS, WITH APPROXIMATELY 40% OF MEN AND WOMEN REPORTING USE DURING 2003\u20132006.  \u00b7  USE OF SUPPLEMENTAL CALCIUM INCREASED FROM 28% DURING 1988\u20131994 TO 61% DURING 2003\u20132006 AMONG WOMEN AGED 60 AND OVER.  STATUS OF OPERATIONS; CONSUMER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND SALES  MORE THAN 150 MILLION AMERICANS DRINK TEA EVERY DAY, AMOUNTING TO SOME 79 BILLION SERVINGS OF TEA IN AMERICA EVERY YEAR. OUR LAUNCH OF VIPOVATM TEA BRAND IS MEANT TO TAP INTO THIS EXISTING DEMAND. PART OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY IS TO BUILD NATIONAL BRANDS THROUGH PRODUCTS THAT LARGE GROUPS OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR AND COMFORTABLE WITH.  PAGE 28 OF 49  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  POVIVA TEA, LLC (NOW POVIVA CORP.). HAS FILED MULTIPLE PATENTS PENDING AND HAS RECEIVED SEVERAL GRANTED PATENTS TO BIND ACTIVE HEMP OIL INGREDIENTS WITH A LIPID, POTENTIALLY ALLOWING FOR MORE EFFICIENT AND COMFORTING DELIVERY OF THE CBD.  LEXARIA BEGAN PRODUCING CASH FLOWS FROM ITS PRODUCTS IN JANUARY 2015 FOCUSING ON THE IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HEMP-OIL-SECTORS THAT ARE FEDERALLY LEGAL. CANNABINOIDS HAVE BEEN FOUND BY MANY RESEARCHERS TO HAVE ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES AND LEXARIA PLANS TO USE THE PATENTED DEHYDRATECH PROCESS TO INFUSE HEMP OILS INTO A NUMBER OF POPULAR FOOD AND BEVERAGES.  LEXARIA HAS LAUNCHED A LINE OF PREMIUM PRODUCTS, ALWAYS RELYING ON OUR DEHYDRATECH PATENTED INFUSION PROCESS, TO BRING HEMP OIL INTO THE MAINSTREAM. BECAUSE HEMP OIL DOES NOT HAVE PSYCHOACTIVE PROPERTIES WE EXPECT OUR PRODUCTS TO APPEAL TO THE WIDEST POSSIBLE CUSTOMER BASE. TO DATE WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR SALES EFFORTS ACROSS THE CONTINENTAL USA. SOME STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT 3% OF THE CANADIAN POPULATION REGULARLY CONSUMES HEMP FOOD PRODUCTS, WHILE 1% OF THE AMERICAN POPULATION REGULARLY CONSUMES HEMP FOOD PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THE CONSUMPTION OF HEMP-BASED FOOD PRODUCTS OFFERS EXCEPTIONAL GROWTH POSSIBILITIES.  ACCORDING TO NUTRITION BUSINESS JOURNAL, THE ORGANIC FOOD SECTOR WAS A $246 BILLION INDUSTRY IN THE USA DURING 2014, WHILE DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS WAS A $34.6 BILLION INDUSTRY. ACCORDING TO ARCVIEW, LEGAL CANNABIS WAS A $4.7 BILLION US INDUSTRY IN 2015 AND EXPECTED TO GROW TO OVER A $20 BILLION SECTOR BEFORE 2025 BUT IS CLEARLY A MUCH SMALLER INDUSTRY SECTOR THAN THE MORE ESTABLISHED FOOD SECTORS. LEXARIA HAS NOT YET DETERMINED WHETHER OUR HEMP OIL-INFUSED PRODUCTS WILL BE ACCEPTED INTO ANY OR ALL THREE OF THESE PARTICULAR SECTORS.  LEXARIA HAS A MAIN CORPORATE WEBSITE (WWW.LEXARIABIOSCIENCE.COM) AS WELL AS SMALLER E-COMMERCE FOCUSED WEBSITES DEVOTED TO CONSUMER PRODUCTS. THE MAJORITY OF PRODUCT SALES HAVE TAKEN PLACE THROUGH THE E-COMMERCE WEBSITES. A CONTRACTED NATIONAL DISTRIBUTION CENTER ENSURES RAPID AND ACCURATE FULFILLMENT OF ALL ORDERS. A 1-800 ORDERING CENTER HAS ALSO BEEN PLACED INTO OPERATION.  ON JUNE 11, 2015, LEXARIA INITIATED THE SIMULTANEOUS FILING OF A U.S. UTILITY PATENT APPLICATION AND AN INTERNATIONAL PATENT APPLICATION UNDER THE PATENT COOPERATION TREATY (PCT) PROCEDURE, BOTH THROUGH THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (\u201cUSPTO\u201d). THESE APPLICATIONS FOLLOW THE COMPANY\u2019S 2014 AND 2015 FAMILY OF PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION FILINGS IN THE U.S. AND SERVE TWO ADDITIONAL BROAD PURPOSES.  1)  LEXARIA IS SEEKING PROTECTION OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY UNDER INTERNATIONAL TREATIES. TO THIS END LEXARIA HAS FILED FOR PCT PATENT APPLICATION PROTECTION. THERE ARE 148 COUNTRIES THAT ARE SIGNATORIES TO THE PATENT COOPERATION TREATY, INCLUDING SUCH MAJOR MARKETS AS CANADA, CHINA, INDIA, MUCH OF EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND JAPAN AMONG OTHERS.  2)  LEXARIA BELIEVES ITS LIPID INFUSION TECHNOLOGY HAS APPLICATIONS BEYOND THE DELIVERY OF JUST CANNABINOIDS. BASED ON FURTHER FORMULATION TESTING, LEXARIA HAS INCLUDED ADDITIONAL LIPOPHILIC MOLECULES THAT MAY BE DELIVERED VIA FOOD AND BEVERAGE FORMATS UTILIZING ITS TECHNOLOGY, WIDELY ENCOMPASSING THREE MAJOR NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COMPANY: NICOTINE; NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES (NSAIDS); AND VITAMINS.  IN DECEMBER 2015, THE COMPANY FILED TWO FURTHER PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATIONS IN THE U.S. THESE NEW APPLICATIONS SERVED TO FURTHER BROADEN THE VARIETY AND APPLICABILITY OF BASE COMPOUNDS THAT CAN BE USED WHEN FORMULATING THE COMPANY\u2019S LIPID BASED TECHNOLOGY. THE FIRST OF THESE APPLICATIONS IDENTIFY COMPOUNDS LIKE EDIBLE STARCHES (E.G., TAPIOCA STARCH) THAT ARE COMMONLY USED IN FOOD PRODUCTS TODAY AND COULD, THEREFORE, SERVE AS A BASE FOR FORMULATING AND INCORPORATING THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY INTO A WIDE VARIETY OF EVERY DAY FOOD PRODUCTS. THE SECOND OF THESE APPLICATIONS IDENTIFY EMULSIFIER COMPOUNDS LIKE GUM ARABIC THAT ARE COMMONLY USED IN BEVERAGE PRODUCTS TODAY IN ORDER TO FACILITATE SIMILAR FLEXIBILITY FOR FORMULATING THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY IN EVERY DAY, SHELF-STABLE BEVERAGES.  PAGE 29 OF 49  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON OCTOBER 26, 2016, THE USPTO ISSUED U.S PATENT NO. 9474725, CANNABINOID INFUSED FOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF, PERTAINING TO OUR METHOD OF IMPROVING BIOAVAILABILITY AND TASTE OF CERTAIN CANNABINOID LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS IN FOOD PRODUCTS. THIS IS THE COMPANY\u2019S FIRST PATENT GRANTED AND HAS A PUBLISH DATE OF OCTOBER 27, 2016 (JUNE 15 2017 IN AUSTRALIA NO. 2015274698) AND PROTECTS OUR TECHNOLOGY FOR TWENTY YEARS. ON DECEMBER 12, 2017, THE USPTO GRANTED PATENT NUMBER US 9,839,612 B2 FOR THE USE OF DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY AS A DELIVERY PLATFORM. ON MAY 22, 2018 PATENT US 9,974,739 B2, \u201cFOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS INFUSED WITH LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\u201d WAS GRANTED PROVIDING FOR \u201cCOMPOSITION OF MATTER\u201d CLAIMS THAT PROTECT THE SPECIFIC COMBINATION OF SUBSTANCES WHICH ENABLE IMPROVED TASTE AND BIOABSORPTION PROPERTIES OF ITS DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY FOR THE DELIVERY OF CANNABINOIDS. ON MAY 15, 2018 PATENT US 9,972,680 B2, \u201cFOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS INFUSED WITH LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\u201d WAS GRANTED PROVIDING CLAIMS THAT PROTECT PROCESSES FOR MAKING SPECIFIC COMPOSITIONS OF MATTER FOR ENHANCED CANNABINOID DELIVERY UTILIZING ITS DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY. ON AUGUST 31, 2018 AUSTRALIAN PATENTS 2017203054, 2018202562, AND 2018202583 WERE GRANTED. ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2018 THE USPTO GRANTED US 10,084,044 B2 AND ON OCTOBER16, 2018 US 10,103,225 B2 WITHIN THE SAME PATENT FAMILY.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT KNOW AND CANNOT KNOW WHETHER THESE STRATEGIES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL, OR IF SUCCESSFUL, HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO GAIN CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE AND CUSTOMER LOYALTY. IT CAN BE A CHALLENGE TO BE SUCCESSFUL BY INTRODUCING NEW CONSUMER PRODUCTS TO A COMPETITIVE RETAIL MARKETPLACE, AND WE CAN OFFER NO ASSURANCES THAT OUR PRODUCTS WILL BE A COMMERCIAL SUCCESS.  INTERNATIONAL PATENT PROTECTION  WHEN LEXARIA FIRST BEGAN EXAMINING THE LEGAL MEDICAL CANNABIS MARKET IN 2013, AND ENTERED THE MARKET IN 2014, THE COMPANY BELIEVED IT COULD MAKE AN IMPACT IN PERHAPS BOTH THE CANADIAN AND U.S. MARKETPLACES. OUR PURSUIT AND DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY HAS EXPANDED OUR POTENTIAL AREA OF IMPACT, BOTH GEOGRAPHICALLY AND BY SECTOR. BECAUSE OF THE APPLICABILITY OF OUR TECHNOLOGY TO MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE LEGAL CANNABIS SECTOR, WE HAVE TAKEN THE NECESSARY STEPS TO PROTECT THAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WITHIN LARGER GLOBAL MARKETS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY LIE WITHIN THE MEDICAL CANNABIS SECTOR OR IN OTHER UNRELATED SECTORS.  ADDITIONAL MOLECULES  NICOTINE.  MORE THAN 99% OF ALL NICOTINE THAT IS CONSUMED WORLDWIDE IS DELIVERED THROUGH SMOKING CIGARETTES. APPROXIMATELY 6,000,000 DEATHS PER YEAR, WORLDWIDE, ARE ATTRIBUTED PRIMARILY TO THE DELIVERY OF NICOTINE THROUGH THE ACT OF SMOKING ACCORDING TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, WHICH ALSO ESTIMATES THAT OVER $170 BILLION PER YEAR IS SPENT JUST IN THE USA ON DIRECT MEDICAL CARE COSTS FOR ADULT SMOKERS. 69% OF U.S. ADULT SMOKERS WANT TO QUIT SMOKING AND 43% OF US ADULT SMOKERS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO QUIT IN ANY TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD.  WORLDWIDE, RETAIL CIGARETTE SALES WERE WORTH $722 BILLION IN 2013, WITH OVER 5.7 TRILLION CIGARETTES SOLD TO MORE THAN 1 BILLION SMOKERS.  RELEVANCE  : LEXARIA POSTULATES THAT ENHANCED DELIVERY OF NICOTINE TO SATISFY CURRENT DEMAND, UTILIZING OUR PATENTED LIPID-DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY, IN NON-COMBUSTED, ORAL PRODUCT FORMATS, COULD SHIFT DEMAND AWAY FROM SMOKING CIGARETTES AND VAPING E-CIGARETTES. SINCE MOST OF THE ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF NICOTINE CONSUMPTION ARE ASSOCIATED WITH TODAY'S INHALED DELIVERY METHODS AND ONLY TO A LESSER DEGREE TO THE ACTUAL CONSUMPTION OF NICOTINE, THERE COULD BE A VAST POSITIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH OUTCOME THROUGH THE REDUCTION IN SMOKING AND VAPING TOBACCO PRODUCTS. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND REGULATORY COMPLIANT INVESTIGATIONS WOULD NEED TO BE CONDUCTED BEFORE OTHERWISE HEALTHY ORAL PRODUCT FORMATS CONTAINING DEHYDRATECH-ENABLED NICOTINE COULD BE INTRODUCED. NICOTINE IS A NAMED MOLECULE IN THE LATEST LEXARIA PATENT APPLICATIONS.  NSAID  . NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES ARE THE SECOND-LARGEST CATEGORY OF PAIN MANAGEMENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN THE WORLD. THE GLOBAL PAIN MANAGEMENT MARKET WAS ESTIMATED AT $22 BILLION IN 2011, WITH $5.4 BILLION OF THIS MARKET BEING SERVED BY NSAID\u2019S. THE U.S. MAKES UP OVER ONE-HALF OF THE GLOBAL MARKET. THE OPIOIDS MARKET (SUCH AS MORPHINE) FORM THE LARGEST SINGLE PAIN MANAGEMENT SECTOR BUT ARE KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SERIOUS DEPENDENCE AND TOLERANCE ISSUES.  SOME OF THE MOST COMMONLY KNOWN NSAIDS ARE ASA (ASPIRIN), IBUPROFEN (ADVIL, MOTRIN), AND ACETAMINOPHEN (TYLENOL - ACETAMINOPHEN IS NOT ACCEPTED BY ALL PERSONS TO BE AN NSAID). ALTHOUGH NSAIDS ARE GENERALLY A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT METHOD FOR PAIN, THEY HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH A NUMBER OF GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS INCLUDING DYSPEPSIA AND GASTRIC BLEEDING.  PAGE 30 OF 49  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RELEVANCE  : LEXARIA POSTULATES THAT DELIVERY OF NSAIDS THROUGH A LIPID-BASED MECHANISM COULD PROVIDE THE BENEFICIAL PROPERTIES OF PAIN RELIEF WITH LESSENED NEGATIVE GASTROINTESTINAL EFFECTS, AND ALSO POTENTIALLY DELIVER LOWER DOSAGES OF ACTIVE INGREDIENTS WITH SIMILAR PAIN MANAGEMENT OUTCOMES AS CURRENT PILL FORMS AT HIGHER DOSAGES. ASA, PIROXICAM, DICLOFENAC, INDOMETHACIN, IBUPROFEN, AND ACETAMINOPHEN ARE ALL NAMED MOLECULES IN THE LATEST LEXARIA PATENT APPLICATIONS.  VITAMINS.  THE GLOBAL VITAMIN AND SUPPLEMENT MARKET IS WORTH $68 BILLION ACCORDING TO EUROMONITOR. THE CATEGORY IS BOTH BROAD AND DEEP, COMPRISED OF MANY POPULAR AND SOME LESSER KNOWN SUBSTANCES. VITAMINS IN GENERAL ARE THOUGHT TO BE AN $8.5 BILLION ANNUAL MARKET IN THE U.S. THE U.S. IS THE LARGEST SINGLE NATIONAL MARKET IN THE WORLD, AND CHINA AND JAPAN ARE THE 2  ND  AND 3  RD  LARGEST VITAMIN MARKETS.  VITAMIN E IS FAT SOLUBLE AND CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO CELL MEMBRANES WHICH CAN PROTECT THEM FROM OXIDATIVE DAMAGE. GLOBAL CONSUMPTION OF NATURAL SOURCE VITAMIN E WAS 10,900 METRIC TONS IN 2013 WORTH $611.9 MILLION.  RELEVANCE  : LEXARIA POSTULATES THAT DELIVERY OF FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS THROUGH ITS PATENTED LIPID-BASED DELIVERY MECHANISM MAY RESULT IN LESS WASTE AND LOWER DOSAGES REQUIRED THAN MOST CURRENT PILL FORMS. AS WELL, INGESTION OF PILLS IS AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE FOR MANY PEOPLE SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT VITAMIN DELIVERY THROUGH COMMON FOOD GROUPS COULD VASTLY EXPAND MARKET DEMAND FOR THIS SECTOR. VITAMIN E IS A NAMED MOLECULE IN THE LATEST LEXARIA PATENT APPLICATIONS.  ON AUGUST 11, 2015, LEXARIA SIGNED A LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH POVIVA TEA LLC FOR $10,000, GRANTING LEXARIA A 35-YEAR NON EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE LICENSE TO UNENCUMBERED USE OF POVIVA TEA LLC\u2019S IP RIGHTS, INCLUDING RIGHTS OF RESALE. THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ENSURES LEXARIA HAS FULL ACCESS TO THE UNDERLYING INFUSION TECHNOLOGY. ON JANUARY 14, 2019 THIS AGREEMENT WAS UPDATED WHEREBY POVIVA CORP. GRANTED LEXARIA AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO THE DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGIES LASTING THE LATER OF 25 YEARS OF THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE LAST OF POVIVA CORP.\u2019S GRANTED PATENTS.  SCIENTIFIC TESTING AND VALIDATION  ON AUGUST 24, 2015, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED POTENTIAL INDUSTRY-CHANGING ACHIEVEMENTS IN ENHANCED GASTRO-INTESTINAL ABSORPTION OF CANNABIDIOL (CBD) UTILIZING LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY. THE THIRD-PARTY TESTING WAS CONDUCTED IN TWO PHASES OF  IN VITRO  TESTS BEGINNING IN JUNE AND COMPLETED IN AUGUST, 2015.  THE INDEPENDENT LABORATORY RESULTS DELIVERED AVERAGE CBD PERMEABILITY OF 499% OF BASELINE PERMEABILITY, COMPARED TO CBD PERMEABILITY WITHOUT LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY. THESE RESULTS EXCEED COMPANY EXPECTATIONS. THIS WAS ASSESSED IN A STRICTLY CONTROLLED,  IN VITRO  EXPERIMENT USING A HUMAN INTESTINAL TISSUE MODEL. SAMPLES OF LEXARIA\u2019S COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CBD-FORTIFIED VIPOVATM BLACK TEA WERE ADMINISTERED IN THE MODEL COMPARED WITH CONCENTRATION-MATCHED CBD CONTROL PREPARATIONS THAT LACKED LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED FORMULATION AND PROCESS ENHANCEMENTS. LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT ITS  IN VITRO  FINDINGS PROVIDE COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF THE INTESTINAL ABSORPTION ENHANCING CAPABILITIES OF ITS TECHNOLOGY, BASED ON WHICH IT IS EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES TO PROGRESS TO MORE ADVANCED, FOLLOW-ON BIOAVAILABILITY TESTING IN ANIMALS.  THE TESTS ALSO SHOWED 325% OF BASELINE GASTRO-INTESTINAL PERMEABILITY OF CBD COMPARING LEXARIA\u2019S CBD-FORTIFIED VIPOVATM BLACK TEA TO A SECOND CONTROL OF CBD AND BLACK TEA COMBINED,  WITHOUT  LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED FORMULATION ENHANCEMENTS. THIS CONFIRMED THAT THE SPECIALIZED PROCESSING UNDERTAKEN BY LEXARIA DURING ITS MANUFACTURING PROCESS TOGETHER WITH ITS FORMULATION ENHANCEMENTS, DOES INDEED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE ABSORPTION LEVELS.  THE BIOAVAILABILITY OF CBD (OR OF THC) VARIES GREATLY BY DELIVERY METHOD. SMOKING TYPICALLY DELIVERS CANNABINOIDS AT AN AVERAGE BIOAVAILABILITY RATE OF 30% (HUESTIS (2007) CHEM. BIODIVERS. 4:1770\u20131804; MCGILVERAY (2005) PAIN RES. MANAG. 10 SUPPL. A:15A \u2013 22A). BY COMPARISON, ORALLY CONSUMED CANNABIS EDIBLES TYPICALLY DELIVER CANNABINOIDS AT AN AVERAGE BIOAVAILABILITY RATE OF ONLY 5% (KARSCHNER ET AL. (2011) CLIN. CHEM. 57:66\u201375).  PAGE 31 OF 49  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY\u2019S PRESENT FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ITS TECHNOLOGY MAY ACHIEVE A 5-FOLD IMPROVEMENT IN CANNABINOID ABSORPTION IN EDIBLE FORM OVER THAT WHICH CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT ITS PROPRIETARY PROCESS AND FORMULATION ENHANCEMENTS. THIS CONCEPTUALLY SUPPORTS THAT LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGH IN CANNABINOID DELIVERY BY APPROXIMATING THE HIGH ABSORPTION LEVELS ACHIEVED AS THOUGH THROUGH ADMINISTRATION BY SMOKING, BUT WITHOUT THE ASSOCIATED NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH CAUSED BY SMOKING.  THE TESTS WERE COMPLETED IN TWO PHASES CULMINATING WITH TESTING USING SIMULATED INTESTINAL FLUID CONDITIONS THAT DELIVERED THESE FINDINGS. THESE RESULTS WERE STRONGER THAN EARLIER ITERATIONS OF THE TESTS THAT DID NOT USE A SIMULATED INTESTINAL FLUID ENVIRONMENT AND CONTRIBUTED TO LEXARIA\u2019S UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS AT WORK. FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS, LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT BIOAVAILABILITY TESTING IN ANIMALS IS LIKELY TO YIELD EVEN STRONGER ABSORPTION RESULTS IN THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL INTESTINAL FLUID CONDITIONS.  CBD HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY FOUND TO PROVIDE BENEFICIAL PAIN RELIEVING, ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, ANTI-ANXIETY, NEUROPROTECTION, ANTI-PSYCHOTIC, AND ANTI-CONVULSIVE EFFECTS AMONG OTHERS. LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED TECHNOLOGY COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE INDIVIDUAL SERVING REQUIREMENTS FOR CBD TO CONSUMERS. THIS COULD LEAD TO REDUCED COSTS OF CONSUMPTION FOR CONSUMERS AND INCREASED PROFITABILITY FOR LEXARIA.  LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT THE SAME TECHNOLOGY USED TO ENHANCE THE ABSORPTION OF CBD IN THE RECENT LABORATORY TESTS, IS APPLICABLE TO THC, NICOTINE, NSAIDS AND OTHER LIPOPHILIC COMPOUNDS THAT ARE WIDELY USED TODAY.  DURING JANUARY 2015, LEXARIA CONDUCTED A STUDY OF NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS IN HUMANS, AS A BIOMARKER FOR ABSORPTION OF CANNABIDIOL, WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE OF THE EFFICIENT ABSORPTION OF CANNABIDIOL FROM LEXARIA FOOD PRODUCTS ENHANCED WITH HEMP OIL, BY DEMONSTRATING THE ELEVATION OF NITRIC OXIDE IN THE HUMAN BODY IN RESPONSE TO PRODUCT INGESTION.  THE STUDY DATA FROM HUMAN SUBJECTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT ELEVATION OF SYSTEMIC NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS AS A SURROGATE BIOMARKER FOR CANNABIDIOL (CBD) BIOABSORPTION IN RESPONSE TO INGESTION OF LEXARIA'S PRODUCTS. THIS PROVIDED CLINICAL SUPPORT FOR THE CBD BIOAVAILABILITY ENHANCING PROPERTIES OF LEXARIA'S PATENTED TECHNOLOGY, ON THE PREMISE THAT BIOAVAILABLE CBD IS KNOWN TO ELEVATE LEVELS OF THE ENDOCANNABINOID ANANDAMIDE IN THE HUMAN BODY WHICH, IN TURN, STIMULATES RELEASE OF NITRIC OXIDE IN THE VASCULAR SYSTEM.  IN SUMMARY, CONSUMING LEXARIA AND VIPOVATM FOOD PRODUCTS RESULTED IN ELEVATED LEVELS OF NITRIC OXIDE WITHIN THE BODY. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY INDICATED THAT ALL LEXARIA AND VIPOVATM FOOD PRODUCTS ELICITED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SALIVARY NITRIC OXIDE, ACHIEVING LEVELS FROM 110 \u039cM TO AS HIGH AS 220 \u039cM IN THE TEST SUBJECTS. THE BEVERAGE PRODUCTS GENERALLY HAD FASTER INITIAL RESPONSES IN AS LITTLE AS 15 MINUTES AFTER PRODUCT INGESTION, WHEREAS THE INITIAL RESPONSES FROM THE PROTEIN-ENERGY BARS REQUIRED 30 MINUTES. THE FASTER RESPONSE TIME WITH THE BEVERAGE PRODUCTS WAS TO BE EXPECTED, GIVEN THE RELATIVE EASE OF DIGESTING LIQUIDS VERSUS SOLIDS. ALL PRODUCTS SUSTAINED THEIR MAXIMUM LEVELS OF NITRIC OXIDE DETECTION THROUGH TO THE 60-MINUTE END-POINTS USED IN THE STUDY, INDICATING A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL STUDY TO DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS REMAIN ELEVATED FOLLOWING PRODUCTION CONSUMPTION.  THE STUDY ASSESSED SIX FLAVORS OF VIPOVATM TEA (YUNAN BLACK, HERBAL CHERRY BLACK, EARL GREY, HERBAL BENGAL CHAI, HERBAL MASALA CHAI AND DECAF ENGLISH BREAKFAST), VIPOVATM COLUMBIAN SUPREMO COFFEE, VIPOVATM HOT CHOCOLATE AND LEXARIA ENERGY FOODS\u2019 CHOCOLATE BERRY DATE AND CASHEW BERRY DATE PROTEIN-ENERGY BARS.  SIX HEALTHY HUMAN SUBJECTS (3 MALE AND 3 FEMALE) BETWEEN THE AGES OF 22 AND 65 YEARS OF AGE WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY. SUBJECTS WERE SCREENED FOR CARDIOVASCULAR AND ALLERGIC RESPONSE TO HEMP PRODUCTS, WERE NON-SMOKERS AND DID NOT HAVE ANY HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE OR ALCOHOL ABUSE. ONE PRODUCT WAS STUDIED PER DAY ACROSS ALL SIX SUBJECTS, WITH EACH SUBJECT CONSUMING A FULL PRODUCT SERVING SIZE. SUBJECTS WERE REQUIRED TO REFRAIN FROM EATING FOOD OR USING VAPE PRODUCTS FOR AT LEAST 12 HOURS BEFORE TEST ARTICLE ADMINISTRATION ON EACH DAY OF THE STUDY. NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS IN THE TEST SUBJECTS WERE ASSESSED USING A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE, COLORIMETRIC TEST KIT DESIGNED TO QUANTIFY SYSTEMIC NITRIC OXIDE VIA A DETECTABLE SALIVARY MARKER. IMMEDIATELY BEFORE TEST ARTICLE ADMINISTRATION EACH DAY, ALL SUBJECTS WERE REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE A NEGATIVE BASELINE NITRIC OXIDE SALIVA TEST. SUBJECTS WERE CONSIDERED TO HAVE A NEGATIVE TEST STRIP READING AT A LEVEL OF 20 \u039cM ACCORDING TO THE TEST STRIP SCALE, AND POSITIVE READINGS ANYWHERE ABOVE THIS. SUBJECTS PERFORMED SALIVARY NITRIC OXIDE TESTING AT 15, 30, 45 AND 60 MINUTES\u2019 POST-CONSUMPTION OF EACH PRODUCT. ALL SUBJECTS REMAINED SEDENTARY FROM BASELINE THROUGH TO THE COMPLETION OF TESTING FOR EACH PRODUCT.  IN AUGUST OF 2018 WE RELEASED RESULTS FROM OUR TURBOCBDTM CAPSULES IN A RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, DOUBLE-BLIND EUROPEAN HUMAN CLINICAL STUDY THAT EVALUATED TURBOCBDTM - A PROPRIETARY, DEHYDRATECHTM POWERED, CANNABIDIOL (\u201cCBD\u201d) FORTIFIED HEMP OIL CAPSULE DEVELOPED BY LEXARIA. THE DEGREE AND SPEED OF CBD ABSORPTION INTO BLOOD PLASMA AND POTENTIAL CARDIOVASCULAR AND COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT IN 12 HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS WERE STUDIED.  PAGE 32 OF 49  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  KEY BIOAVAILABILITY DATA HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE STUDY COMPARING THE 90 MG DOSE OF LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM TO A 90 MG DOSE OF A POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION WITHOUT LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY WERE AS FOLLOWS.  \u00b7  30 MINUTES: CBD DELIVERED FROM LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES WAS ABSORBED MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN FROM THE POSITIVE CONTROL, DELIVERING 317% MORE CBD TO BLOOD AT THE 30-MINUTE MARK OF THE STUDY (I.E., 18.4 NG/ML COMPARED TO ONLY 4.4 NG/ML ON AVERAGE RESPECTIVELY [95% CI; P=0.051]);  \u00b7  60 MINUTES: THE TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES WENT ON TO DELIVER MORE CBD TO THE BLOOD AT THE 60-MINUTE MARK (I.E., 38.8 NG/ML) THAN THE POSITIVE CONTROL CAPSULES WERE ABLE TO REACH AT ANY TIME DURING THE 6-HOUR STUDY, FURTHER DEMONSTRATING THE EXCEPTIONAL RAPIDITY OF ACTION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TURBOCBDTM CAPSULES;  \u00b7  90 MINUTES: THE TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES FURTHER WENT ON TO DELIVER SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CBD TO THE BLOOD (86% MORE) THAN THE POSITIVE CONTROL CAPSULES AT THE 90-MINUTE MARK (I.E., 53.0 NG/ML COMPARED TO ONLY 28.4 NG/ML RESPECTIVELY [95% CI; P=0.034]);  \u00b7  THROUGH TO STUDY COMPLETION: LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES CONTINUED TO DELIVER MORE CBD TO BLOOD THAN THE POSITIVE CONTROL CAPSULES AT EACH SUBSEQUENT TIME POINT IN THE STUDY THROUGH TO THE 6-HOUR MARK WHEN THE STUDY WAS COMPLETED.  ADDITIONAL STUDY ANALYSIS WAS RELEASED IN FEBRUARY 2019.  KEY METABOLIC AND HEMODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE FINDINGS LINKED TO BIOAVAILABILITY ENHANCEMENTS WERE REVEALED IN THE STUDY, WHICH COMPARED A 90 MG DOSE OF LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM TO A 90 MG DOSE WITHOUT LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY (THE \u201cPOSITIVE CONTROL\u201d) AS WELL AS A PLACEBO, AS FOLLOWS.  \u00b7  ANALYSIS OF MEAN ARTERIAL BLOOD PRESSURE (MAP) AT PEAK BLOOD LEVELS OF CBD ACHIEVED WITH LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN MAP COMPARED TO PLACEBO (95% CI; P=0.027). THIS FINDING WAS NOT OBSERVED WITH THE DOSE-MATCHED POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION FOR WHICH THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN MAP COMPARED TO PLACEBO (95% CI; P=0.625);  \u00b7  CEREBRAL PERFUSION WAS ALSO ANALYSED BY AN INDEX OF CONDUCTANCE IN THE MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY (MCA). THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM CAUSED THE GREATEST INCREASE IN MCA CONDUCTANCE RELATIVE TO BOTH THE POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION AND PLACEBO (95% CI; P=0.017 AND P=0.002 RESPECTIVELY);  FINALLY, OVER THE SIX-HOUR STUDY, ANALYSIS OF THE TOTAL AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) DEMONSTRATED THAT LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM RESULTED IN A NOTABLE TREND FOR HIGHER LEVELS OF CBD IN THE BLOODSTREAM OVERALL THAN THE POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION WITH TOTAL AUC OF 10,865 \u00b1 6,322 OBSERVED WITH LEXARIA\u2019S FORMULATION COMPARED TO 7,115 \u00b1 2,978 OBSERVED WITH THE POSITIVE CONTROL (95% CI; P=0.096). FURTHERMORE, WHEN NORMALIZED TO BODY MASS, THE AUC AT THE PEAK CBD CONCENTRATION WAS MARKEDLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY (95% CI; P=0.02) HIGHER WITH THE TURBOCBDTM 90 MG DOSE COMPARED TO THE 90 MG DOSE POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION.  THESE RESULTS CORROBORATE AND CONFIRM OTHER IN VITRO AND IN VIVO STUDIES THAT HAVE EVALUATED LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY. ALTHOUGH THIS STUDY EVALUATED ABSORPTION ONLY OF CBD AND ITS METABOLITES, LEXARIA BELIEVES NEARLY IDENTICAL BIOAVAILABILITY ENHANCEMENT RESULTS WOULD BE ACHIEVED WITH OTHER CANNABINOIDS.  DURING MARCH OF 2019 WE ALSO LAUNCHED AN IN VIVO RESEARCH PROGRAM TO TEST LEXARIA DESIGNED NANOTECH ENHANCEMENTS COMPRISED OF ELEVEN SEPARATE ANIMAL STUDIES AND RELEASED INITIAL RESULTS DURING MAY 2019 DEMONSTRATING MEASURABLE QUANTITIES OF CANNABIDIOL INTO BLOOD IN AS LITTLE AS 2 MINUTES. IN EACH ARM OF THE ANIMAL STUDIES, 10 MALE SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS WERE ADMINISTERED CBD AT 25MG PER KG OF BODYWEIGHT. DELIVERY OF CBD INTO THE BLOODSTREAM WAS MONITORED OVER A 60-MINUTE DURATION. IN THE FIRST ANIMAL STUDY RESULTS, LEXARIA COMPARED ITS STANDARD DEHYDRATECH FORMULATION THAT COMBINES CANNABINOIDS WITH LONG-CHAIN FATTY ACIDS (\u201cLCFA\u201d) USING LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATION PROCESSING TECHNIQUE TO A CONCENTRATION-MATCHED FORMULATION UTILIZING COCONUT OIL WHICH IS A COMMONLY USED MEDIUM CHAIN TRIGLYCERIDE (\u201cMCT\u201d) OIL IN THE CANNABIS EDIBLES INDUSTRY.  PAGE 33 OF 49  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u00b7  AT 2 MINUTES DEHYDRATECH\u2019S LCFA FORMULATION DELIVERED MEASURABLE CBD IN BLOOD, COMPARED TO NO MEASURABLE CBD IN BLOOD UNTIL 6 MINUTES AND ONWARDS FOR THE MCT OIL FORMULATION.  \u00b7  AT 15 MINUTES DEHYDRATECH\u2019S LCFA FORMULATION ACHIEVED A CBD BLOOD CONCENTRATION LEVEL THAT WAS 475% MORE THAN THE MCT OIL FORMULATION; AND, THE DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION CBD BLOOD LEVELS REACHED AT 15 MINUTES WERE GREATER THAN THE CBD BLOOD LEVELS REACHED BY THE MCT OIL FORMULATION AT ANY TIME POINT DURING THE 60-MINUTE EVALUATION.  \u00b7  AT 60 MINUTES DEHYDRATECH\u2019S LCFA FORMULATION ACHIEVED A CBD BLOOD CONCENTRATION LEVEL OF 319% MORE THAN THE MCT OIL FORMULATION.  \u00b7  OVER THE ENTIRE 60-MINUTE STUDY, THE ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED THE STANDARD DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE MAXIMUM CBD BLOOD CONCENTRATION LEVEL THAT WAS 334% MORE THAN THE AVERAGE MAXIMUM BLOOD CONCENTRATION LEVEL OF THE ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED THE MCT OIL FORMULATION (P<0.0021).  \u00b7  OVER THE ENTIRE 60-MINUTE STUDY, THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) (TOTAL QUANTITY OF CBD DELIVERED) FOR THE LEXARIA DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION WAS 389% MORE THAN THE MCT OIL FORMULATION (P<0.0011).  LEXARIA ALSO TESTED FOR BRAIN TISSUE CONCENTRATIONS TO QUANTIFY 8-HOUR CBD DELIVERY FROM THE DEHYDRATECH-ENABLED LCFA FORMULATION COMPARED TO THE MCT OIL FORMULATION AND DEHYDRATECH\u2019S LCFA FORMULATION OUTPERFORMED THE MCT OIL FORMULATION BY 246%.  THE COMPANY RELEASED ADDITIONAL RESULTS FROM ITS MARCH 2019 RESEARCH PROGRAM WHEREIN ANIMAL TESTING PROVED THAT COMBINING LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY WITH GENERIC NANOTECH TECHNIQUES DELIVERS 1,137% MORE CANNABIDIOL INTO ANIMAL BRAIN TISSUE FOLLOWING ORAL INGESTION THAN CERTAIN EXISTING INDUSTRY FORMULATIONS. LEXARIA COMBINED ITS DEHYDRATECH DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY WITH A STANDARD FORM OF NANOTECHNOLOGY AND ANALYZED SUBSEQUENT DELIVERY INTO BRAIN TISSUE FOLLOWING ORAL INGESTION. DELIVERY OF CBD INTO THE BRAIN WAS REPORTED 8 HOURS AFTER DOSING.  \u00b7  THE LEXARIA DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION  WITHOUT  NANOTECH ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE BRAIN TISSUE ACCUMULATION LEVEL THAT WAS 246% HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE FOR THOSE ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED THE MCT OIL FORMULATION (P=0.0013).  \u00b7  THE LEXARIA DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION WITH NANOTECH ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE BRAIN TISSUE ACCUMULATION LEVEL THAT WAS 1,137% HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE FOR THOSE ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED THE MCT OIL FORMULATION (P=0.0178).  WE HAVE ALSO COMPLETED OUR FIRST STUDY EVALUATING DEHYDRATECH  TM  USED IN A TOPICAL CREAM FORMULATION FOR ABSORPTION OF CBD THROUGH HUMAN SKIN. RESULTS PROVED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN BOTH SPEED AND QUANTITY OF CBD ABSORPTION THROUGH SKIN WHEN COMPARED TO CONTROL FORMULATIONS. THE ABSORPTION STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON HUMAN SKIN AT A CALIFORNIA-BASED LABORATORY THAT SPECIALIZES IN FRANZ DIFFUSION CELL SKIN PERMEABILITY TESTING. LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY WAS USED TOGETHER WITH A SOPHISTICATED OIL-IN-WATER EMULSION FORMULATION DESIGN AND COMPARED TO A SERIES OF MATCHING OIL-IN-WATER EMULSION FORMULATIONS PREPARED WITH THE SAME CBD INPUTS, WITH AND WITHOUT THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY AND WITH AND WITHOUT TWO LEADING SKIN PENETRATION ENHANCERS CURRENTLY USED IN THE SKIN PRODUCTS INDUSTRY. SEVERAL FACTORS WERE MEASURED, INCLUDING THE TIME REQUIRED TO DETECT CBD SKIN PENETRATION AND QUANTITY, AND PEAK AMOUNTS OF CBD ABSORBED INTO AND THROUGH THE SKIN, AT MULTIPLE TESTING INTERVALS OVER A 48-HOUR DURATION.  LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  -ENABLED TOPICAL FORMULATION, ABSENT EITHER OF THE COMMERCIAL PENETRATION ENHANCERS, WAS THE FASTEST ACTING FOR ABSORPTION INTO THE EPIDERMIS, DERMIS OR THROUGH THE SKIN INTO THE SYSTEMIC FRACTION REPRESENTING PERMEATION INTO THE UNDERLYING CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  -ENABLED PRODUCT ALSO HAD NO ODOUR EVEN WITHOUT THE USE OF PERFUMES, CONTRARY TO OTHER CANNABINOID INDUSTRY PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE QUITE STRONGLY ODORIFEROUS WITHOUT THE USE OF MASKING PERFUMES.  PAGE 34 OF 49  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FURTHERMORE, LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  -ENABLED TOPICAL FORMULATION WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF EITHER OF THE COMMERCIAL PENETRATION ENHANCERS, DEMONSTRATED THE HIGHEST OVERALL AVERAGE QUANTITY OF CBD DELIVERED THROUGH THE SKIN AND INTO THE REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEMIC FRACTION OF ALL THE FORMULATIONS TESTED, WITH AS MUCH AS A 225% INCREASE IN CBD PERMEABILITY WHEN COMPARED TO THE HIGHEST PERFORMING COMMERCIAL PENETRATION ENHANCER FORMULATION ASSESSED AND ALMOST A 1,900% INCREASE IN CBD PERMEABILITY WHEN COMPARED TO A CONTROL FORMULATION THAT WAS DEVOID OF BOTH THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY OR ANY COMMERCIAL PENETRATION ENHANCERS. THE COMMERCIAL SKIN PENETRATION ENHANCERS ONLY DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE THAT WAS ON PAR OR SUPERIOR TO THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  -ENABLED FORMULATIONS TESTED IN SO FAR AS TOTAL CBD ABSORPTION INTO THE SHALLOW EPIDERMIS OR DERMIS WAS CONCERNED.  WE HAVE ALSO COMPLETED OUR FIRST INGESTIBLE NICOTINE IN VIVO (ANIMAL) ABSORPTION STUDY. LEXARIA IS PURSUING THE USE OF ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY AS A POSSIBLE NEW NICOTINE DELIVERY METHOD, AN EDIBLE DOSE ABSORBED THROUGH THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT, WITH POTENTIAL BOTH AS A NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY AS WELL AS AN ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT FORMAT FOR REGULAR TOBACCO USERS.  DEHYDRATECH  TM  DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING MAJOR NICOTINE ABSORPTION PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS: 1,160% FASTER DELIVERY OF EQUIVALENT PEAK QUANTITIES OF NICOTINE TO THE BLOODSTREAM THAN ACHIEVED WITH CONTROLS (WITHIN 15 MIN VS. 2.9 HOURS), 148% GAIN IN THE QUANTITY OF PEAK NICOTINE DELIVERY TO THE BLOODSTREAM RELATIVE TO CONTROLS, 560% HIGHER BRAIN LEVELS OF NICOTINE WHERE NICOTINE EFFECTS ARE FOCUSED, COMPARED TO CONTROLS, LOWER URINE LEVELS OF NICOTINE EXCRETED THAN CONTROLS, FOR ENHANCED NICOTINE ACTIVITY AND BIOAVAILABILITY OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY, LOWER QUANTITIES OF KEY LIVER METABOLITES IN THE BLOODSTREAM THAN CONTROLS AS HYPOTHESIZED, SUGGESTING BYPASS OF FIRST PASS LIVER METABOLISM.  STUDY DESIGN PARAMETERS.  THE STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO PRINCIPALLY ASSESS THE RELATIVE INGESTIBLE NICOTINE ABSORPTION PERFORMANCE OF DEHYDRATECH  TM  -POWERED FORMULATIONS COMPARED TO CONCENTRATION-MATCHED CONTROL FORMULATIONS THAT LACKED ANY FORM OF DELIVERY ENABLING TECHNOLOGY IN RATS. NICOTINE WAS ADMINISTERED IN A NICOTINE POLACRILEX DERIVATIVE FORMAT AS IS WIDELY COMMERCIALIZED TODAY IN NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY PRODUCTS SUCH AS CHEWING GUMS. TWELVE MALE RATS WERE DIVIDED INTO FOUR GROUPS OF THREE, SUCH THAT DEHYDRATECH  TM  AND CONTROL FORMULATIONS WERE EACH TESTED AT A 1 MG/KG AND 10 MG/KG DOSAGE LEVEL. FORMULATIONS WERE ADMINISTERED ORALLY AND ALL RATS WERE CANNULATED FOR BLOOD COLLECTION AT MULTIPLE INTERVALS OVER AN 8 HOUR DURATION POST-DOSING WITH THE FIRST DATA COLLECTION AT THE 15-MINUTE MARK. URINE AND FECES WERE ALSO COLLECTED FOR UP TO A 24-HOUR DURATION POST-DOSING, AND ESSENTIAL ORGAN TISSUE SAMPLES WERE ALSO COLLECTED FOR EXAMINATION AFTER THE STUDY. ALL SAMPLES WERE SUBJECTED TO ANALYTICAL TESTING IN ORDER TO QUANTIFY THE LEVELS OF NICOTINE THEREIN, AS WELL AS THE LEVELS OF THREE MAJOR LIVER METABOLITES THEREOF, HYDROXYCOTININE, NICOTINE N\u2019-OXIDE AND COTININE, IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE RELATIVE METABOLITE LEVELS ABSORBED BY THE DIFFERENT FORMULATIONS. LEXARIA\u2019S HYPOTHESIS WAS TESTED TO PROVE THAT ITS DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY WOULD INFLUENCE MORE RAPID AND COMPLETE INTESTINAL BIOABSORPTION OF NICOTINE LYMPHATICALLY WITH LESS METABOLIC DEGRADATION BY THE LIVER. ALL ANIMALS WERE ALSO ASSESSED FOR GENERAL TOLERABILITY OF THE ADMINISTERED FORMULATIONS. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT THE SAME INDEPENDENT LABORATORY IN PHILADELPHIA WHERE THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS INITIAL CANNABIDIOL ABSORPTION STUDY IN 2015.  RESULTS & OBSERVATIONS.  THE LEXARIA FORMULATIONS GENERALLY ACHIEVED FASTER ABSORPTION, HIGHER PEAK ABSORPTION AND HIGHER OVERALL QUANTITIES OF NICOTINE, ON AVERAGE, IN THE BLOOD THAN THE CONCENTRATION-MATCHED CONTROL FORMULATIONS AT BOTH THE 1MG AND 10 MG/KG DOSES TESTED. FURTHERMORE, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THERE WERE NO OBVIOUS SIGNS OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISTRESS SUCH AS VOMITING OR DIARRHEA INDICATING THAT THE ANIMALS APPEARED TO TOLERATE THE TREATMENT WELL.  NICOTINE BLOOD LEVELS WERE EVALUATED MULTIPLE TIMES OVER A PERIOD OF 8 HOURS AFTER DOSING. IN THE 10MG/KG DOSING ARM, THE CONTROL FORMULATION REQUIRED NEARLY 3 HOURS TO REACH SIMILAR LEVELS OF BLOOD ABSORPTION THAT THE LEXARIA FORMULATION REACHED IN ONLY 15 MINUTES. FURTHERMORE, THE LEXARIA FORMULATION WENT ON THEREAFTER TO DEMONSTRATE PEAK PLASMA LEVELS THAT WERE 148% OF THOSE ACHIEVED BY THE CONTROL FORMULATION. IF REPLICATED IN HUMAN STUDIES, THESE FINDINGS ARE SUGGESTIVE THAT LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY COULD PROVE MORE EFFECTIVE IN ELEVATING BLOOD NICOTINE LEVELS THROUGH EDIBLE FORMATS MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND SUBSTANTIALLY THAN PREVIOUSLY THEORIZED, POTENTIALLY MAKING INGESTIBLE NICOTINE PREPARATIONS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO TODAY\u2019S AVAILABLE PRODUCT FORMATS WHILE ALSO LEADING TO A MORE RAPID NICOTINE CRAVING SATIATION.  PAGE 35 OF 49  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ANALYSIS OF THE LIVER METABOLITES REVEALED, AS EXPECTED, THAT OVERALL LEVELS IN THE BLOOD OF TWO OF THE THREE METABOLITES STUDIED WERE HIGHER IN THE CONTROL GROUP THAN IN THE LEXARIA FORMULATION GROUP AT THE 10 MG/KG DOSE. THIS RESULT WAS ESPECIALLY PRONOUNCED IN THE 45-MINUTE TO 2-HOUR TIME INTERVAL POST-DOSING WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPECTED TIMING OF RELEASE OF METABOLITES IN HIGHER QUANTITY INTO THE BLOODSTREAM BY THE LIVER FOLLOWING NORMAL PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSING OF INGESTED NICOTINE WITH THE CONTROL PREPARATION, COMPARED TO THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BELIEVED TO ELUDE FIRST PASS LIVER METABOLISM. THE LEXARIA FORMULATION ALSO DEMONSTRATED LOWER QUANTITIES OF NICOTINE IN THE RAT URINE AT BOTH DOSES, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FACT THAT THE LEVELS OF NICOTINE IN THE RAT BLOOD REMAINED HIGHER OVER THE DURATION OF THE STUDY WITH THE LEXARIA FORMULATION THAN WITH THE CONTROL. THE STUDY ALSO REVEALED THAT THE LEXARIA FORMULATION AT THE 10 MG/KG LEVEL ACHIEVED UP TO 5.6-TIMES AS MUCH NICOTINE UPON ANALYSIS OF THE RAT BRAIN TISSUE THAN WAS RECOVERED WITH THE MATCHING CONTROL FORMULATION. THESE FINDINGS TOGETHER PERHAPS SUGGEST PROLONGATION OF NICOTINE EFFECTIVENESS WITH THE LEXARIA FORMULATION WHICH MAY ALSO BE BENEFICIAL IN HUMANS TO CONTROL CRAVINGS OVER AN EXTENDED TIME-PERIOD FROM A SINGLE EDIBLE NICOTINE DOSE.  IN OUR FOLLOW-UP THIRD-PARTY  IN VIVO  STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT STUDY, INCLUDING TWO GROUPS OF 20 ANIMALS, FURTHER DEFINING DELIVERY OF NICOTINE IN EDIBLE FORM AT EACH OF THE 2, 4, 6, 8 AND 10-MINUTE INTERVALS POST-DOSING, WITH 90.2% GREATER DELIVERY THAN THE CONCENTRATION-MATCHED CONTROL FORMULATION BY THE 10-MINUTE MARK (95% CI; P=0.044), AND SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER ABSORPTION LEVELS THAN THE CONTROL FORMULATION AT ALL SUBSEQUENT TIME POINTS IN THE STUDY. SPEED OF ONSET IS A KEY ATTRIBUTE FOR ORAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND IT IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF NON-INHALATION NICOTINE DELIVERY FORMATS.  KEY HIGHLIGHTS OF THE FOLLOW-UP STUDY ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u00b7  PEAK LEVEL: 79% IMPROVEMENT IN PEAK BLOOD LEVELS (MAXIMUM CONCENTRATION OR \u201cCMAX\u201d) AT 394 NG/ML USING LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY VS. 220 NG/ML WITH THE CONTROL (95% CI; P=0.0257);  \u00b7  T  OTAL QUANTITY: 94% IMPROVEMENT IN TOTAL QUANTITY OF NICOTINE DELIVERED (AREA UNDER THE CURVE OR \u201cAUC\u201d) TO THE BLOOD DURING THE 60-MINUTE COURSE OF THE STUDY, AT 266 HR\u2022NG/ML VERSUS 137 HR\u2022NG/ML (95% CI; P=0.0086);  \u00b7  RAPIDITY: LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY DELIVERED NICOTINE INTO THE BLOOD STREAM BY THE FIRST TIME INTERVAL OF BLOOD SAMPLING AT THE 2-MINUTE MARK. ON AVERAGE, LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY DELIVERED 203 NG/ML TO THE BLOOD IN AGGREGATE OF THE 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 AND 15-MINUTE TIME POINTS, COMPARED TO ONLY 120 NG/ML IN AGGREGATE OVER THE SAME PERIOD BY THE CONTROL, AN IMPROVEMENT OF 70% (95% CI; P=0.0004).  IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE DESCRIBED SCIENTIFIC TESTING AND VALIDATION STUDIES, LEXARIA HAS ALSO CONDUCTED VARIOUS CANNABINOID FORMULATION EXPERIMENTS, TOGETHER WITH POTENTIAL DEHYDRATECHTM LICENSEE PARTNERS, ON CHOCOLATES, CANDIES, GUMMIES, MOUTH-MELTS, CHOCOLATE BARS, PROTEIN BARS, BEVERAGES SUCH AS BEER, SPICES, TEA, COFFEE, SUPPLEMENTS AND MORE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. BEVERAGE FORMULATIONS HAVE PRODUCED CANNABINOID WATER-BASED PRODUCTS INCLUDING DE-ALCOHOLIZED BEER THAT MASK UNWANTED CANNABIS FLAVOR AND ARE FAST ACTING. CHOCOLATE FORMULATIONS WERE REPORTED AS BEING THE FASTEST ACTING, MOST CONSISTENT, AND BEST-TASTING PRODUCTS RELATIVE TO COMPARATOR CONTROL FORMULATIONS IN APPROXIMATELY 70% OF CASES IN A RECENT 2017 CONSUMER STUDY. AS WELL, ON MARCH 22, 2016, LEXARIA ANNOUNCED RESULTS FROM ANOTHER CHOCOLATE FORMULATION CONSUMER STUDY IN WHICH TEST SUBJECTS RANKED THOSE CHOCOLATES THAT HAD BEEN CREATED WITH LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY AS THE BEST TASTING, MOST PALATABLE AND PROVIDING THE BEST OVERALL EXPERIENCE OF THE CHOCOLATES SAMPLED. FURTHERMORE, THE TEST SUBJECTS IN THAT STUDY INDICATED A TIME OF ONSET OF THE CANNABIS OIL EFFECTS IN AS LITTLE AS 15-20 MINUTES ON AVERAGE. THE STUDY INCLUDED 12 VOLUNTEERS WHO WERE ALL REGULAR CANNABIS CONSUMERS WITH EXPERIENCE INGESTING CONVENTIONAL EDIBLES. ALL CHOCOLATES USED IN THE STUDY WERE BLINDED (UNMARKED) IN ORDER THAT THE SUBJECTS COULD NOT DISCERN THE PRODUCT FORMULATIONS APPLIED.  PAGE 36 OF 49  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TECHNOLOGY OUT-LICENSING  ON MAY 14, 2016, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH NUKA ENTERPRISES, LLC (\u201cNUKA\u201d) FOR A TWO-YEAR PERIOD, TO UTILIZE THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE, TEST, MANUFACTURE, AND SELL MARIJUANA-INFUSED CONSUMABLE AND/OR TOPICAL PRODUCTS, IN THE STATE OF COLORADO, WITH AN OPTION OF EXTENDING THE TERMS OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT TO WASHINGTON, OREGON, AND CALIFORNIA. ON APRIL 30, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A NEW 10-YEAR RENEWAL LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH NUKA, MAKER OF 1906 BRAND CANNABIS CHOCOLATES AND OTHER EDIBLE PRODUCTS. THE NEW AGREEMENT PROVIDES NUKA WITH SEMI-EXCLUSIVE ABILITY TO UTILIZE THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY ACROSS THE US. NUKA ALSO ACQUIRED AN OPTION TO EXPAND ITS PRODUCTS AND BRAND TO CANADA, INCLUDING USING LEXARIA\u2019S EXISTING CHOCOLATE AND CONFECTIONS CONTRACT MANUFACTURER LICENSEE CANNFECTIONS GROUP INC. THE AGREEMENT INCORPORATES NEW RIGHTS IN PRODUCT CATEGORIES IN ADDITION TO THE ORIGINAL CHOCOLATE FORMATS, WHICH INCLUDE CANDIES, BEVERAGES, CAPSULES AND PILLS, AND TOPICAL CREAMS. ON MAY 21, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED A MAJOR EXPANSION IN OPERATIONS BY NUKA OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS INTO ILLINOIS, OHIO, MASSACHUSETTS, MICHIGAN AND OTHER STATES. THE COMPREHENSIVE SEMI-EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT PROVIDES NUKA AND 1906 WITH COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES UNTIL 2028. A SECOND LICENSE PROVIDES NUKA AND 1906 WITH THE IMMEDIATE ABILITY TO UTILIZE DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY FOR CBD ACROSS THE US MARKETPLACE.  ON JANUARY 25, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH A 7-YEAR TERM WITH CANNFECTIONS GROUP INC. WHEREBY LEXARIA IS PROVIDING ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY TO EMPOWER NEXT-GENERATION PERFORMANCE IN CANNABIS INFUSED CHOCOLATES AND CANDIES TO BE DEVELOPED AND SOLD IN CANADA AND INTERNATIONALLY.  ON FEBRUARY 26, 2018 THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT ENTERED AN AGREEMENT WITH NEUTRISCI INTERNATIONAL INC. (\"NEUTRISCI\") (TSX-V: NU, OTCQB: NRXCF) SUCH THAT NEUTRISCI NOW OWNS 100% OF AMBARII TRADE CORPORATION AND LEXARIA HAS GRANTED TO NEUTRISCI AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSE AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT FOR THE MANUFACTURING AND SALE OF CBD BASED PRODUCTS. THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN TERMINATED EFFECTIVE MARCH 15, 2019.  ON FEBRUARY 27, 2018 THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH LOS ANGELES-BASED, PRIVATELY-HELD BIOLOG, INC. (\u201cBIOLOG\u201d) FOR A 5-YEAR TERM WHEREBY LEXARIA PROVIDED ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY TO EMPOWER A UNIQUE SET OF NEXT-GENERATION FOOD AND BEVERAGE CANNABIS INFUSION PRODUCTS TO BE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES. ON JUNE 10, 2019 THE COMPANY TERMINATED ITS LICENSE WITH BIOLOG INC.  ON APRIL 25, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH GP HOLDINGS LLC, (\u201cGP\u201d) WHEREBY LEXARIA PROVIDED ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY FOR CANNABIS INFUSED BEVERAGES AND TOPICAL SKIN PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA. GP ACQUIRED A 5-YEAR SEMI-EXCLUSIVE RIGHT. SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR END, ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2018, THE COMPANY CANCELLED THE CONTRACT DUE TO ONGOING DELAYS AND NON-PERFORMANCE.  ON JULY 31, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED, AND HILL STREET BEVERAGE COMPANY INC., (TSXV:BEER; \u201cHILL STREET\u201d) JOINTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO LICENSE LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  , ON A SEMI-EXCLUSIVE BASIS, FOR A TERM OF FIVE (5) YEARS, TO PRODUCE A LINE OF CANNABIS-INFUSED ALCOHOL-FREE BEVERAGES FOR CANADIAN DISTRIBUTION, FOLLOWING REGULATORY APPROVAL.  ON JANUARY 15, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY LEXARIA NICOTINE LLC (\u201cLEXARIA NICOTINE\u201d) AND ALTRIA VENTURES INC., AN INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF ALTRIA GROUP, INC. (\u201cALTRIA\u201d), EXECUTED DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS TO PURSUE INNOVATION IN ORAL, REDUCED RISK NICOTINE CONSUMER PRODUCTS USING LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY. ALTRIA WAS GRANTED A LICENSE TO USE LEXARIA BIOSCIENCE\u2019S DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY FOR ORAL NICOTINE DELIVERY FORMS ON AN EXCLUSIVE BASIS IN THE UNITED STATES AND A NON-EXCLUSIVE BASIS ELSEWHERE GLOBALLY. ALTRIA WILL PAY LEXARIA NICOTINE A ROYALTY ON REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE SALE OF NICOTINE PRODUCTS CONTAINING DEHYDRATECH, UNTIL SUCH TIME IT MAY ACQUIRE 100% OWNERSHIP IN LEXARIA NICOTINE.  ON APRIL 24, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE 5-YEAR AGREEMENT, VIA ITS SUBSIDIARY LEXARIA CANPHARM ULC, TO PROVIDE LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY TO A PRIVATE CALIFORNIA-BASED COMPANY FOR ITS UTILIZATION IN CERTAIN CBD-BASED BEVERAGES TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA THAT MAY INCLUDE ANY COMBINATION OF READY-TO-DRINK BEVERAGES SUCH AS NON-ALCOHOLIC BEERS, WINES AND SPIRITS; COLD OR HOT COFFEE OR TEAS, SPORTS DRINKS AND MORE.  ON MAY 7, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE 5-YEAR AGREEMENT, VIA ITS SUBSIDIARY LEXARIA HEMP CORP., TO PROVIDE LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY TO A PRIVATE NEVADA-BASED COMPANY FOR ITS UTILIZATION IN CERTAIN CBD-BASED BEVERAGES TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD ACROSS THE USA THAT MAY INCLUDE ANY COMBINATION OF READY-TO-DRINK BEVERAGES SUCH AS NON-ALCOHOLIC BEERS, WINES AND SPIRITS; COLD OR HOT COFFEE OR TEAS, SPORTS DRINKS AND MORE.  PAGE 37 OF 49  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE CONTINUATION OF OUR BUSINESS INTERESTS IN THESE SECTORS IS DEPENDENT UPON OBTAINING FURTHER FINANCING, A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS OF DEVELOPMENT, AND, ULTIMATELY, ACHIEVING A PROFITABLE LEVEL OF OPERATIONS. THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES BY US COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT DILUTION IN THE EQUITY INTERESTS OF OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS. OBTAINING COMMERCIAL LOANS, ASSUMING THOSE LOANS WOULD BE AVAILABLE, WILL INCREASE OUR LIABILITIES AND FUTURE CASH COMMITMENTS.  WE ARE NOT YET PROFITABLE AND HAVE NOT YET DEMONSTRATED OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES FROM OUR BUSINESS PLAN. WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CORPORATE FUNDS IF OUR EXISTING CAPITAL IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY UNTIL POTENTIAL FUTURE PROFITABILITY IS REACHED. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FURTHER FUNDS REQUIRED FOR OUR LONG-TERM OPERATIONS. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL OPERATING CAPITAL DURING OUR FISCAL 2019 YEAR, BUT DO EXPECT TO REQUIRE CAPITAL IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH OUR OWN, FEDERALLY LICENSED CANADIAN LABORATORY ON-PREMISES FOR OUR INTERNAL R&D PURPOSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US WHEN NEEDED OR, IF AVAILABLE, THAT IT CAN BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN THE ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS AS PLANNED, AND WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET OUR OTHER LONGER-TERM OBLIGATIONS AS THEY BECOME DUE. IN SUCH EVENT, WE COULD BE FORCED TO SCALE DOWN OR PERHAPS EVEN CEASE OUR OPERATIONS. THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER WE CAN OBTAIN ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FINANCING IF WE DO IN FACT REQUIRE IT.  OUR BUSINESS PLAN ANTICIPATES THAT WE WILL HIRE THREE TO SIX EMPLOYEES AND INCLUDES NEW OFFICE SPACE THAT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN ORDER TO FACILITATE A FEDERALLY LICENSED CANADIAN LABORATORY ON-PREMISES FOR OUR INTERNAL R&D PURPOSES. AS AT MAY 31, 2019 OFFICE SPACES ARE PRIMARILY COMPLETE AND IN-USE, THE LABORATORY SPACE IS ALSO PRIMARILY COMPLETE WITH FINAL EQUIPMENT DESIGN AND ACQUISITION IN PROGRESS AND WE HAVE HIRED THREE EMPLOYEES WITH A FOURTH SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN THE LABORATORY SPACE DURING OUR FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER. WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE CONTRACTED THIRD PARTIES FOR MOST OF OUR PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION NEEDS, INSTEAD FOCUSING OUR CAPITAL ON HIGHER VALUE-ADDED ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS SUCH AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND SCIENTIFIC TESTING. WE HAVE NO CURRENT PLANS TO BUILD OUR OWN PRODUCTION FACILITY.  OUR COMPANY RELIES ON THE BUSINESS EXPERIENCE OF OUR EXISTING MANAGEMENT, ON THE TECHNICAL ABILITIES OF CONSULTING EXPERTS, AND ON THE TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL ABILITIES OF ITS OPERATING PARTNER COMPANIES TO EVALUATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.  COMPETITION  THE LEGAL MARIJUANA INDUSTRY IS COMPRISED OF SEVERAL SUB-SECTORS AND IS LEGAL UNDER DIFFERENT GUIDELINES IN MANY STATES THOUGH IT REMAINS ILLEGAL UNDER MOST FEDERAL LAWS. NOTWITHSTANDING, THE OVERALL SECTOR IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED TO BE ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING IN THE USA, WITH STATE-LEGAL REVENUE OF OVER $8 BILLION IN 2016. INDEPENDENT PROJECTIONS AND PUBLICIZED REPORTS EXPECT REVENUE OF $20 BILLION OR MORE IN 2020, BOTH AS THE SECTOR GAINS IN CREDIBILITY AND ACCEPTANCE, AND AS MORE AND MORE STATES LEGALIZE EITHER MEDICAL USE OR ADULT RECREATIONAL USE; OR BOTH. IN ANY FAST GROWING INDUSTRY, COMPETITION IS EXPECTED TO BE BOTH STRONG AND ALSO DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE AS TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE COMPETITIVE THREATS. WHILE WE ARE AN EARLY ADOPTER WITHIN THE CANNABINOID DELIVERY SECTOR, THERE ARE ALREADY REPORTS OF MORE THAN 300 PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT HAVE CLAIMED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE SECTOR IN SOME FASHION; AND AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF PRIVATE COMPANIES. OUR CURRENT STRATEGIES MAY PROVE TO BE INEFFECTIVE AS THE SECTOR GROWS AND MATURES, AND IF SO, WE WILL HAVE TO ADAPT QUICKLY TO CHANGING SECTORAL CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY INTENDS TO AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE TECHNOLOGY OUT-LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES NOT ONLY WITHIN THE CANNABINOIDS SECTOR WHERE IT IS ALREADY ACTIVE, BUT ALSO ACROSS OTHER SECTORS WHERE ITS DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY IS PATENT ALLOWED AND/OR PENDING, INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE VITAMIN AND SUPPLEMENTS SECTOR, THE PAIN RELIEF SECTOR AND THE NICOTINE PRODUCTS SECTOR.  COMPETITION IN ALTERNATIVE HEALTH SECTORS AND IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS IN THE USA IS FIERCE. WE EXPECT TO ENCOUNTER COMPETITIVE THREATS FROM EXISTING PARTICIPANTS IN THE SECTOR AND NEW ENTRANTS. ALTHOUGH POVIVA CORP. HAS FILED PATENT APPLICATIONS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT PATENTS BEYOND THOSE ALREADY ISSUED WILL BE GRANTED NOR THAT OTHER FIRMS MAY NOT FILE SUPERIOR PATENTS PENDING. FOOD SUPPLEMENTS, ORGANIC FOODS, AND HEALTH FOOD MARKETS ARE ALL WELL ESTABLISHED AND OUR COMPANY WILL FACE MANY CHALLENGES TRYING TO ENTER THESE MARKETS. LEXARIA IS ALSO AWARE OF VARIOUS COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES THAT EXIST IN THE MARKETPLACE THAT CLAIM TO ALSO ENHANCE THE BIOABSORPTION OF CANNABINOIDS AS LEXARIA HAS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH REPEATED  IN VITRO  AND  IN VIVO  SCIENTIFIC TESTING WITH ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY. BY AND LARGE, THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALL FORMS OF NANOTECHNOLOGY THAT GENERALLY CLAIM TO ENABLE THE FORMATION OF MICROENCAPSULATED MICROEMULSIONS OF CANNABINOID ACTIVE INGREDIENTS. THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN ENABLE EXCEPTIONAL WATER SOLUBILITY OF CANNABINOID INGREDIENTS AND CAN IMPART IMPROVED INTESTINAL BIOABSORPTION AS A RESULT.  PAGE 38 OF 49  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HOWEVER, IT IS LEXARIA\u2019S BELIEF THAT ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY OFFERS A HOST OF BENEFITS BEYOND WHAT COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES CAN OFFER, INCLUDING SUPERIOR ORAL PALATABILITY, A MORE APPEALING AND ALL-NATURAL INGREDIENT COMPOSITIONAL PROFILE FROM A FOOD AND BEVERAGE FORMULATION PERSPECTIVE AND SUPERIOR SCALABILITY AND COST EFFECTIVENESS FROM A MANUFACTURING PERSPECTIVE. LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT ITS DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY IS, THEREFORE, SIGNIFICANTLY DISTINGUISHED FROM COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES IN THESE RESPECTS, WITH A VIEW TO GROWING THE BREADTH AND NUMBER OF LICENSEES THAT WILL ADOPT ITS TECHNOLOGY FOR THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS GOING FORWARD. LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT THESE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES TOGETHER WITH ITS WEALTH OF SCIENTIFIC DATA SHOWING NOTEWORTHY BIOABSORPTION ENHANCEMENTS WITH ITS DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY CONSTITUTE A COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITION FOR ITS PROSPECTIVE LICENSEES, AND IT INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS NOT ONLY WITHIN THE CANNABINOIDS EDIBLES SECTOR WHERE IT IS ALREADY ACTIVE, BUT ALSO IN THE VARIOUS OTHER BIOACTIVE INGREDIENT SECTORS IDENTIFIED IN ITS ISSUED AND PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS.  COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION  OVER 30 STATES IN THE USA HAVE PASSED SOME FORM OF LEGISLATION RELATED TO THAT STATE\u2019S PERMISSION TO GROW, CULTIVATE, SELL OR USE MARIJUANA EITHER FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES OR FOR RECREATIONAL OR \u201cADULT USE\u201d PURPOSES; OR BOTH. THE VARIOUS STATE LEGISLATION IS NOT NECESSARILY HARMONIOUS WITH ONE ANOTHER, LEADING TO POTENTIAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN STATE LAWS. IT IS MOST OFTEN NOT LEGAL TO TRANSPORT CANNABIS-RELATED PRODUCTS ACROSS STATE LINES.  LEXARIA DOES NOT \u201cTOUCH THE PLANT\u201d IN ANY LOCATION WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF THE USA. WE COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW THAT PROVIDES FOR CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL (INDUSTRIAL) HEMP AND CERTAIN BYPRODUCTS TO BE MANUFACTURED AND SOLD IN THE US. THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY MAY HAVE APPLICATIONS WITHIN THE LEGAL MARIJUANA SECTOR AND WE MAY SEEK TO LICENSE THAT TECHNOLOGY TO COMPANIES THAT HAVE MET AND COMPLY WITH STATE REGULATIONS FOR THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION OF CANNABIS RELATED PRODUCTS IN ANY PARTICULAR JURISDICTION.  LEXARIA\u2019S POSITION IS THAT, JUST AS A TELEPHONE COMPANY PROVIDES COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, AND AN ELECTRIC COMPANY PROVIDES ELECTRICAL POWER, OUR PROVISION OF TECHNOLOGICAL SERVICES TO A STATE-LEGAL CANNABIS COMPANY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REQUIRED REGULATIONS.  LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY MAY ALSO HAVE APPLICATION IN COMPLETELY SEPARATE SECTORS SUCH AS VITAMINS, NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES, AND NICOTINE. WE HAVE NO PRODUCTS NOR OPERATIONS IN ANY OF THESE SECTORS TODAY, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE COMMENCED FORMULATION DEVELOPMENT FOR RESEARCH AND VALIDATION PURPOSES IN EACH OF THESE AREAS. IF WE ENTER ANY OF THESE SECTORS AT ANY TIME, WE WILL BE EXPOSED TO AND OF NECESSITY WILL HAVE TO COMPLY WITH, ALL LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN EACH OF THOSE SECTORS. AS A RESULT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF LEXARIA BEING INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF DISPARATE BUSINESS SECTORS, COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE FROM OUR COMPANY.  THE US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PASSED THE 2018 FARM BILL (THE \u201cBILL\u201d), IN DECEMBER OF 2018, THAT MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACTS ON INDUSTRY SEGMENTS THAT WE OPERATE AND HAVE PRODUCTS IN AND POTENTIALLY CHANGE SOME OF THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE RISKS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. THE BILL INCLUDES LIFTING RESTRICTIONS ON ADVERTISING, MARKETING, BANKING AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AS WELL AS ALLOWING INTERSTATE COMMERCE FOR HEMP AND HEMP-DERIVED CANNABIDIOL (CBD), REMOVE BARRIERS FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTIONS UNDER FEDERAL LAW SUCH AS PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS, AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER MEASURES THAT MAY POSITIVELY IMPACT THESE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS OVERALL. THE IMPACT THE BILL MAY HAVE ON OTHER REGULATORY BODIES AND THEIR REGULATIONS WILL REQUIRE ONGOING MONITORING TO DETERMINE THE OUTCOME AND TIMING OF ANY REVISIONS.  SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS  WE HAVE LEASED A NEW HEAD-OFFICE LOCATION IN KELOWNA, CANADA, THAT INCLUDED THE PURCHASE AND CONSTRUCTION OF OFFICE EQUIPMENT, FURNITURE, COMPUTERS, AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. WE ALSO CONSTRUCTED SPACE FOR A FEDERAL LICENSED CANADIAN LABORATORY ON-PREMISES FOR OUR INTERNAL R&D PURPOSES, FOR WHICH A LICENSE APPLICATION HAS BEEN FILED WITH HEALTH CANADA. COSTS INCURRED TO DATE ARE INCLUDED IN CAPITALIZED ASSETS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  LEXARIA INCURRED $394,091 (2018 $279,221) IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES DURING THE PERIOD ENDING MAY 31, 2019.  SPECIFIC R&D PROGRAMS ARE IN ONGOING DEVELOPMENT AND WILL BE TIGHTLY RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL ABILITY TO UNDERTAKE EACH RESEARCH PHASE FOR EACH MOLECULE. DUE TO OUR EXPANDING PORTFOLIO COVERAGE, WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXAMINE ACCELERATED TIMETABLE OPTIONS FOR TESTING, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S PLANS TO INCLUDE  IN VITRO  ABSORPTION TESTS OF OUR PATENTED TECHNOLOGY OF MOLECULES SUCH AS: VITAMIN E, IBUPROFEN, AND NICOTINE ALLOWED US TO PERFORM TESTING ON NICOTINE WITH POSITIVE RESULTS. OUR PLAN TO CONDUCT OUR FIRST EVER  IN VIVO  ABSORPTION TESTS ON CBD ALSO YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS. ONGOING TESTING PLANS ARE PROCEEDING TO FURTHER DEFINE MOLECULAR COMPATIBILITY, ABSORPTION RATES, TIMING AND VIABLE FORMATS OF DELIVERY.  THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY FOCUSES ON NEW R&D PROGRAMS TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS FOR ITS TECHNOLOGY. THESE INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, ONGOING PROGRAMS TO EXPLORE METHODS TO INTEGRATE NANOEMULSIFICATION CHEMISTRY TECHNIQUES TOGETHER WITH ITS TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS ONGOING PROGRAMS TO FURTHER ENHANCE INTESTINAL BIOABSORPTION RATES WITH ITS TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS ONGOING PROGRAMS TO EXPAND THE TYPES AND BREADTH OF PRODUCT FORM FACTORS INTO WHICH ITS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE APPLIED. DEPENDING ON HOW MANY OF THESE TESTS ARE UNDERTAKEN, R&D BUDGETS ARE EXPECTED TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY, TO DO SO. IT IS IN OUR BEST INTERESTS TO REMAIN FLEXIBLE AT THIS EARLY STAGE OF OUR R&D EFFORTS IN ORDER TO CAPITALIZE ON POTENTIAL NOVEL FINDINGS FROM EARLY-STAGE TESTS AND THUS RE-DIRECT RESEARCH INTO SPECIFIC AVENUES THAT OFFER THE MOST REWARD.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT ARE MATERIAL TO STOCKHOLDERS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED IN THE UNITED STATES. PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENT'S APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. WE BELIEVE THAT UNDERSTANDING THE BASIS AND NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED WITH THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS CRITICAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIALS.  CAPITAL ASSETS  CAPITAL ASSETS ARE STATED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES OR BY UNITS OF PRODUCTION.  PAGE 41 OF 49  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PATENTS  CAPITALIZED PATENT COSTS REPRESENT LEGAL COSTS INCURRED TO ESTABLISH PATENTS. WHEN PATENTS REACH A MATURE STAGE, ANY ASSOCIATED LEGAL COSTS ARE COMPRISED MOSTLY OF MAINTENANCE FEES AND ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. CAPITALIZED PATENT COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE PATENT.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  PRODUCT REVENUE  REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF ALTERNATIVE HEALTH PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS UPON SHIPMENT. THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS SALES NET OF THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL SALES RETURNS. SALES TAX COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS IS EXCLUDED FROM NET SALES.  LICENSING REVENUE FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR LICENSE FEES AT A POINT IN TIME FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OUR PATENTED LIPID NUTRIENT INFUSION TECHNOLOGY DEHYDRATECHTM FOR INFUSING ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS, TO THE LICENSEE, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS ON DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTATION.  USAGE FEES FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR USAGE FEES WHEN USAGE OF OUR DEHYDRATECHTM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OCCURS BY LICENSEES INFUSING AND ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT INTO ONE OR MORE OF THEIR PRODUCT LINES FOR SALE.  GOING CONCERN  WE HAVE SUFFERED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS. THE CONTINUATION OF OUR COMPANY AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR COMPANY ATTAINING AND MAINTAINING PROFITABLE OPERATIONS AND/OR RAISING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENT RELATING TO THE RECOVERY AND CLASSIFICATION OF RECORDED ASSET AMOUNTS OR THE AMOUNT AND CLASSIFICATION OF LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SHOULD OUR COMPANY DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS. THE RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS AND NET CAPITAL DEFICIENCY RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  IN JANUARY 2016, FASB ISSUED AN ASU, SUBTOPIC 82510, TO AMEND CERTAIN ASPECTS OF RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT, PRESENTATION, AND DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. MOST PROMINENT AMONG THE AMENDMENTS IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, TO BE RECOGNIZED THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS RATHER THAN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE STANDARD SEPTEMBER 1, 2018. THE IMPACT WAS NOT MATERIAL AND THE $14,247 IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WAS INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  IN FEBRUARY 2016 FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 201602, LEASES (TOPIC 842) WHICH SUPERSEDES FASB ASC TOPIC 840, LEASES (TOPIC 840) AND PROVIDES PRINCIPLES FOR THE RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT, PRESENTATION, AND DISCLOSURE OF LEASES FOR BOTH LESSEES AND THE LESSORS. THE NEW STANDARD REQUIRES THE LESSEES TO APPLY A DUAL APPROACH, CLASSIFYING LEASES AS EITHER FINANCE OR OPERATING LEASES BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF WHETHER OR NOT THE LEASE IS EFFECTIVELY A FINANCED PURCHASE BY THE LESSEE. THE CLASSIFICATION WILL DETERMINE WHETHER LEASE EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD OR ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE, RESPECTIVELY. A LESSEE IS ALSO REQUIRED TO RECORD A RIGHT OF USE ASSET AND A LEASE LIABILITY FOR ALL LEASES WITH A TERM OF GREATER THAN TWELVE MONTHS REGARDLESS OF CLASSIFICATION. LEASES WITH A TERM OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR SIMILAR TO EXISTING GUIDANCE FOR OPERATING LEASES. THE STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED UPON ISSUANCE. WHEN ADOPTED, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THIS GUIDANCE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  PAGE 42 OF 49  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW STANDARD TO REPLACE THE INCURRED LOSS IMPAIRMENT METHODOLOGY IN CURRENT U.S. GAAP WITH A METHODOLOGY THAT REFLECTS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF A BROADER RANGE OF REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE INFORMATION TO INFORM CREDIT LOSS CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES. FOR TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, LOANS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO USE A FORWARD LOOKING EXPECTED LOSS MODEL RATHER THAN THE INCURRED LOSS MODEL FOR RECOGNIZING CREDIT LOSSES WHICH REFLECTS LOSSES THAT ARE PROBABLE. CREDIT LOSSES RELATING TO AVAILABLE FOR SALE DEBT SECURITIES WILL ALSO BE RECORDED THROUGH AN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RATHER THAN AS A REDUCTION IN THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITIES. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR LEXARIA BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1, 2020, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. APPLICATION OF THE AMENDMENTS IS THROUGH A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO DEFICIT AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE STANDARD ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 201802, INCOME STATEMENT\u2013REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220): RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH ALLOWS A RECLASSIFICATION FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO RETAINED EARNINGS FOR STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ENACTED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON DECEMBER 22, 2017 (THE \u201c2017 TAX ACT\u201d). CONSEQUENTLY, THE AMENDMENTS ELIMINATE THE STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE 2017 TAX ACT AND WILL IMPROVE THE USEFULNESS OF INFORMATION REPORTED TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT USERS. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL ENTITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED, INCLUDING ADOPTION IN ANY INTERIM PERIOD, (1) FOR PUBLIC BUSINESS ENTITIES FOR REPORTING PERIODS FOR WHICH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN ISSUED AND (2) FOR ALL OTHER ENTITIES FOR REPORTING PERIODS FOR WHICH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN MADE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE EFFECT THIS ASU WILL HAVE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES, BUT DOES NOT EXPECT IT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 201807, COMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING. THIS IS A SIMPLIFICATION THAT INVOLVES SEVERAL ASPECTS OF ACCOUNTING FOR NONEMPLOYEE SHARE BASED PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF TOPIC 718 TO INCLUDE SHARE BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS FOR ACQUIRING GOODS AND SERVICES FROM NONEMPLOYEES. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR LEXARIA FOR SEPTEMBER 1, 2019. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT IT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DURING THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2019, OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE LOWER COMPARED TO THE NINE-MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018, WHICH IS A RESULT OF THE DECREASES IN CONSULTING EXPENSES DUE TO LOWER CONTRACTUAL SHARE BASED AND SHARE BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES BUT INCLUDE INCREASES IN LEGAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS AND PATENT FILINGS, NEW EMPLOYEES AND R&D.  REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY BASED ON LICENSING USAGE FEES IN LINE WITH CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS, WHILE CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES REMAIN LOW DUE TO CHALLENGES IN SECURING EXPANSIVE DISTRIBUTION OPPORTUNITIES, PRODUCTION CHALLENGES AND PAYMENT PROCESSING CHANGES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURSUE MORE WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION POSSIBILITIES WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO UNLOCK MORE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER REVENUES.

DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2019, OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE LOWER COMPARED TO THE THREE-MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018, WHICH IS A RESULT OF THE DECREASES IN CONSULTING EXPENSES DUE TO LOWER CONTRACTUAL SHARE BASED AND SHARE BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES BUT INCLUDE INCREASES IN LEGAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS AND PATENT FILINGS, NEW EMPLOYEES AND R&D.  REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY BASED ON LICENSING USAGE FEES IN LINE WITH CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS, WHILE CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES REMAIN LOW DUE TO CHALLENGES IN SECURING EXPANSIVE DISTRIBUTION OPPORTUNITIES, PRODUCTION CHALLENGES AND PAYMENT PROCESSING CHANGES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURSUE MORE WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION POSSIBILITIES WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO UNLOCK MORE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER REVENUES.  THE TREND OF HEMP OIL FORTIFIED FOODS, AND HEMP SEED PRODUCTS, GAINING CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE CONTINUED AND PROVIDES A REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SALES COULD INCREASE. THOSE TRENDS SHOULD SUPPORT HIGHER POTENTIAL CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES. IN ADDITION, LEGISLATIVE TRENDS IN AMERICA AND IN MANY NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD SUCH AS CANADA AND THE UK ARE SUPPORTIVE OF ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HEMP-BASED FOODS AND SUPPLEMENTS SECTOR. THOSE TRENDS COULD SUPPORT HIGHER POTENTIAL CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES. RELEASE OF THE TURBOCBD  TM  PRODUCT WAS SUCCESSFUL BUT SALES WERE LIMITED BY CHANGES TO PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL. THE INITIAL RELEASE OF CHRGD+ WAS WELL RECEIVED AND WE ARE IN PROGRESS OF FINAL DEVELOPMENT AND RELEASE OF THE ONLINE ORDERING PORTAL FOR BOTH RETAIL AND CHANNEL DISTRIBUTION, WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE OPERATIONAL DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  PAGE 44 OF 49  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR 2019 THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO DERIVE THE MAJORITY OF ITS REVENUES FROM TECHNOLOGY LICENSING TO THIRD PARTIES NOTING THAT IP TERRITORY FEES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN NEW DEFINITIVE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OCCUR AND IP USAGE FEES ARE DEPENDENT UPON LICENSEES OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENTS THE TECHNOLOGY BASED UPON REGULATORY APPROVAL. CANADIAN REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR INGESTIBLE PRODUCTS IS ANTICIPATED OCTOBER 17, 2019, WHEN ENTITIES ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR PERMITS TO DISTRIBUTE AND SELL THEIR PRODUCTS. AT AUGUST 31, 2015 THE COMPANY HAD ZERO TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENTS ENTERED. BY AUGUST 31, 2016 WE HAD ENTERED SEVERAL LOI\u2019S OR DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY OUT-LICENSING. DURING THE PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 WE ENTERED INTO SIX NEW LICENSING AGREEMENTS (ALTHOUGH SOME WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CANCELLED DUE TO NON PERFORMANCE) THAT INCREASED OUR IP LICENSING REVENUE AND WE EXPECT ADDITIONAL REVENUE WILL BE GENERATED FROM THE LICENSEES UTILIZING THE TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR PROCESSES FROM THE USAGE FEES AS THEIR PRODUCTION AND SALES OCCUR. IT IS THE COMPANY\u2019S VIEW THAT THE DECEMBER 9, 2017, GRANT OF PATENT US 9,839,612 B2, THE GRANTS OF US 9,972,680 B2 AND US 9,974,739 B2 DURING MAY 2018, THE SEPTEMBER 25, 2018 GRANT OF US 10,084,044 B2, THE OCTOBER 16, 2018 GRANT OF US 10,103,225 B2 AND ITS EXPANDING PATENT PORTFOLIO ARE POSITIVE STEPS IN ENABLING THE GENERATION OF MORE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES. AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED MORE THAN 10 FORMAL LETTERS OF INTENT OR DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS AND IS NEGOTIATING MORE.  WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT ALL OF THE LETTERS OF INTENT INTO WHICH WE ENTER WILL RESULT IN DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS WITH PAYING CUSTOMERS AND CANNOT PREDICT HOW MANY WILL. WE BELIEVE THAT STRENGTHENING AND EXPANDING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO AND CONDUCTING SUPPORTIVE R&D WILL JOINTLY CONTRIBUTE TO STRENGTHENING REVENUE PROSPECTS.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSISTENT BETWEEN THE COMPARISON PERIODS WITH INCREASES IN ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONS, INVESTOR RELATIONS, INCREASES TO ONGOING LEGAL FEES FOR PATENT AND TRADEMARK FILINGS, LEGAL FEES FOR CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS, R&D PROGRAMS AND EMPLOYEE ADDITIONS.

TOTAL MARKETPLACE SPENDING  WE OFFER SALES INCENTIVES AND DISCOUNTS THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMS TO CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS. TOTAL MARKETPLACE SPENDING INCLUDES SALES INCENTIVES, DISCOUNTS, ADVERTISING AND OTHER MARKETING ACTIVITIES. SALES INCENTIVES AND DISCOUNTS ARE PRIMARILY ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE. A NUMBER OF OUR SALES INCENTIVES, SUCH AS BOTTLER FUNDING TO INDEPENDENT BOTTLERS AND CUSTOMER VOLUME REBATES, ARE BASED ON ANNUAL TARGETS, AND ACCRUALS ARE ESTABLISHED DURING THE YEAR FOR THE EXPECTED PAYOUT.  THESE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACT TERMS AND OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR PROGRAMS AND REQUIRE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT WITH RESPECT TO ESTIMATING CUSTOMER PARTICIPATION AND PERFORMANCE LEVELS. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ESTIMATED EXPENSE AND ACTUAL INCENTIVE COSTS ARE NORMALLY INSIGNIFICANT AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DIFFERENCES ARE DETERMINED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN ADVERTISING AND MARKETING COSTS ARE ALSO BASED ON ANNUAL TARGETS AND RECOGNIZED DURING THE YEAR AS INCURRED.  FOR INTERIM REPORTING, OUR POLICY IS TO ALLOCATE OUR FORECASTED FULL-YEAR SALES INCENTIVES FOR MOST OF OUR PROGRAMS TO EACH OF OUR INTERIM REPORTING PERIODS IN THE SAME YEAR THAT BENEFITS FROM THE PROGRAMS. THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON OUR FORECASTED SALES INCENTIVES FOR THE FULL YEAR AND THE PROPORTION OF EACH INTERIM PERIOD\u2019S ACTUAL GROSS REVENUE OR VOLUME, AS APPLICABLE, TO OUR FORECASTED ANNUAL GROSS REVENUE OR VOLUME, AS APPLICABLE. BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF THE FORECASTS AT EACH INTERIM PERIOD, ANY CHANGES IN ESTIMATES AND THE RELATED ALLOCATION OF SALES INCENTIVES ARE RECOGNIZED BEGINNING IN THE INTERIM PERIOD THAT THEY ARE IDENTIFIED. IN ADDITION, WE APPLY A SIMILAR ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY FOR INTERIM REPORTING PURPOSES FOR CERTAIN ADVERTISING AND OTHER MARKETING ACTIVITIES.  INCOME TAXES  IN DETERMINING OUR QUARTERLY PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, WE USE AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WHICH IS BASED ON OUR EXPECTED ANNUAL INCOME, STATUTORY TAX RATES AND TAX PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO US IN THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, THE TCJ ACT WAS ENACTED IN THE UNITED STATES. AMONG ITS MANY PROVISIONS, THE TCJ ACT IMPOSED A MANDATORY ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON UNDISTRIBUTED INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS AND REDUCED THE U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018.

INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE MADE. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE.  IN THE  12  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA REFLECT THE MONTHS OF  MARCH, APRIL AND MAY  . IN THE  24  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA REFLECT THE MONTHS OF  JANUARY THROUGH MAY  . IN THE  24 WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES GENERATED  40%  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE, WITH MEXICO, RUSSIA, CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND CHINA COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY  19%  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE. AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD. IN EACH OF THE  12 AND 24 WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE REDUCED NET REVENUE GROWTH BY  3  PERCENTAGE POINTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN THE RUSSIAN RUBLE, TURKISH LIRA, EURO, ARGENTINE PESO AND BRAZILIAN REAL. CURRENCY DECLINES AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR WHICH ARE NOT OFFSET COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.  IN ADDITION, VOLATILE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND CIVIL UNREST IN CERTAIN MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD, INCLUDING IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, MEXICO, THE MIDDLE EAST, RUSSIA AND TURKEY, AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IN CERTAIN OF THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, CONTINUE TO, AND THE THREAT OR IMPOSITION OF TARIFFS IN OR RELATED TO THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS MAY, RESULT IN CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO THE UNITED KINGDOM\u2019S PENDING WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, INCLUDING HOW THE UNITED KINGDOM WILL INTERACT WITH OTHER EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES FOLLOWING ITS DEPARTURE, AS WELL AS THE ECONOMIC, OPERATING AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN RUSSIA AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT FOR THE ESSA SEGMENT AND OUR OTHER BUSINESSES.  CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD HAVE EITHER IMPOSED, OR ARE CONSIDERING IMPOSING, NEW OR INCREASED TAXES OR REGULATIONS ON THE MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION OR SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING, INGREDIENTS OR SUBSTANCES CONTAINED IN, OR ATTRIBUTES OF, OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING, COMMODITIES USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING OR THE RECYCLABILITY OR RECOVERABILITY OF OUR PACKAGING. THESE TAXES AND REGULATIONS VARY IN SCOPE AND FORM. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME TAXES APPLY TO ALL BEVERAGES, INCLUDING NON-CALORIC BEVERAGES, WHILE OTHERS APPLY ONLY TO BEVERAGES WITH A CALORIC SWEETENER (E.G., SUGAR). IN ADDITION, SOME REGULATIONS APPLY TO ALL PRODUCTS USING CERTAIN TYPES OF PACKAGING (E.G., PLASTIC), WHILE OTHERS ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF PACKAGING AND ENCOURAGE WASTE REDUCTION AND INCREASED RECYCLING RATES.  WE SELL A WIDE VARIETY OF BEVERAGES, FOODS AND SNACKS IN MORE THAN  200  COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES AND THE PROFILE OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL, THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH PRODUCTS AND THE TYPE OF PACKAGING USED VARIES BY JURISDICTION. BECAUSE OF THIS, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE SCOPE OR FORM POTENTIAL TAXES, REGULATIONS OR OTHER LIMITATIONS ON OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING MAY TAKE, AND THEREFORE CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT OF SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS OR LIMITATIONS ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, TAXES, REGULATIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY IMPACT US AND OUR COMPETITORS DIFFERENTLY. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR EXISTING AND PROPOSED TAXES AND REGULATIONS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED AND SOLD AND TO CONSIDER ACTIONS WE MAY TAKE TO POTENTIALLY MITIGATE THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OR LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING ADVOCATING ALTERNATIVE MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPOSITION, FORM AND SCOPE OF ANY SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS OR LIMITATIONS.  ADDITIONALLY, OUR INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO BE AFFECTED BY DISRUPTION OF THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE, INCLUDING THE RAPID GROWTH IN SALES THROUGH E-COMMERCE WEBSITES AND MOBILE COMMERCE APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, THE INTEGRATION OF PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL OPERATIONS AMONG RETAILERS AND THE INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION OF HARD DISCOUNTERS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR CHANGES IN THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE AND TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS WE MAY TAKE TO BUILD OUR GLOBAL E-COMMERCE CAPABILITIES, DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS EFFECTIVELY THROUGH ALL EXISTING AND EMERGING CHANNELS OF TRADE AND POTENTIALLY MITIGATE ANY UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS ON OUR FUTURE RESULTS.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, THE TCJ ACT WAS ENACTED IN THE UNITED STATES.  WHILE OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE RECORDED IMPACT OF THE  TCJ ACT  AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018 WAS DEEMED TO BE COMPLETE  , THIS AMOUNT WAS BASED ON PREVAILING REGULATIONS AND AVAILABLE INFORMATION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018, AND ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE  IRS  IMPACTED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO IMPACT, OUR RECORDED AMOUNTS AFTER DECEMBER 29, 2018.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF THE TCJ ACT, SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, \u201cOUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d AND \u201cOUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d IN THIS FORM 10-Q, AS WELL AS NOTE 5 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  2018  FORM 10-K.  IN A REFERENDUM HELD ON MAY 19, 2019, SWITZERLAND PASSED  TRAF  , EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020. THE TRAF DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE  12 AND 24 WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  . ENACTMENT OF TRAF PROVISIONS SUBSEQUENT TO OUR SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN FUTURE PERIODS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ASSESS THE IMPACT THE TRAF MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.  SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  SEE NOTE 9 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-Q FOR THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS OF  JUNE 15, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 29, 2018  AND NOTE 9 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  2018  FORM 10-K FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE ITEMS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 OUR BUSINESS RISKS\u201d IN OUR  2018  FORM 10-K SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN EVALUATING OUR TRENDS AND FUTURE RESULTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 CONSOLIDATED REVIEW  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  VOLUME  SINCE OUR DIVISIONS EACH USE DIFFERENT MEASURES OF PHYSICAL UNIT VOLUME (I.E., KILOS, GALLONS, POUNDS AND CASE SALES), A COMMON SERVINGS METRIC IS NECESSARY TO REFLECT OUR CONSOLIDATED PHYSICAL UNIT VOLUME. OUR DIVISIONS\u2019 PHYSICAL VOLUME MEASURES ARE CONVERTED INTO SERVINGS BASED ON U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION GUIDELINES FOR SINGLE-SERVING SIZES OF OUR PRODUCTS. FOR THE  12 AND 24 WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , TOTAL SERVINGS INCREASED 3% AND 3.5%, RESPECTIVELY.  WE DISCUSS VOLUME FOR OUR BEVERAGE BUSINESSES ON A BOTTLER CASE SALES (BCS) BASIS IN WHICH ALL BEVERAGE VOLUME IS CONVERTED TO AN 8-OUNCE-CASE METRIC. MOST OF OUR BEVERAGE VOLUME IS SOLD BY OUR COMPANY-OWNED AND FRANCHISE-OWNED BOTTLERS, AND THAT PORTION IS BASED ON OUR BOTTLERS\u2019 SALES TO RETAILERS AND INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS. THE REMAINDER OF OUR VOLUME IS BASED ON OUR DIRECT SHIPMENTS TO RETAILERS AND INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS. WE REPORT SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INTERNATIONAL BEVERAGE VOLUME ON A MONTHLY CALENDAR BASIS. THE  12  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  INCLUDE BEVERAGE VOLUME OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA FOR THE MONTHS OF  MARCH, APRIL AND MAY  . THE  24  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  INCLUDE BEVERAGE VOLUME OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR THE MONTHS OF  JANUARY THROUGH MAY  .

OPERATING PROFIT PERFORMANCE WAS DRIVEN BY CERTAIN OPERATING COST INCREASES, A 5-PERCENTAGE-POINT IMPACT OF HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS, AND HIGHER ADVERTISING AND MARKETING EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EFFECTIVE NET PRICING AND PRODUCTIVITY SAVINGS.  HIGHER RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES (SEE \u201cITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY\u201d) AND A PRIOR-YEAR GAIN ON THE REFRANCHISING OF A PORTION OF OUR BEVERAGE BUSINESS IN THAILAND EACH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING PROFIT PERFORMANCE BY 5 PERCENTAGE POINTS.  24  WEEKS  OPERATING PROFIT DECREASED  2%  AND OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED  0.8  PERCENTAGE POINTS. OPERATING PROFIT PERFORMANCE WAS DRIVEN BY CERTAIN OPERATING COST INCREASES, A 6-PERCENTAGE-POINT IMPACT OF HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS, AND HIGHER ADVERTISING AND MARKETING EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET REVENUE GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY SAVINGS.  HIGHER RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES (SEE \u201cITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY\u201d) AND A PRIOR-YEAR GAIN ON THE REFRANCHISING OF A PORTION OF OUR BEVERAGE BUSINESS IN THAILAND NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING PROFIT PERFORMANCE BY 4 PERCENTAGE POINTS AND 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS, RESPECTIVELY.

NET INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED  $13 MILLION  , REFLECTING LOWER INTEREST INCOME DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE CASH BALANCES, AS WELL AS LOWER GAINS ON THE MARKET VALUE OF INVESTMENTS USED TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR DEFERRED COMPENSATION LIABILITY. THESE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES.  THE REPORTED TAX RATE DECREASED  16.5  PERCENTAGE POINTS, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE PRIOR-YEAR PROVISIONAL NET TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE TCJ ACT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PRIOR-YEAR FAVORABLE RESOLUTION WITH THE IRS OF ALL OPEN MATTERS RELATED TO THE AUDITS OF TAXABLE YEARS 2012 AND 2013.

NON-GAAP MEASURES  CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-Q ADJUST FOR THE IMPACT OF SPECIFIED ITEMS AND ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP). WE USE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES INTERNALLY TO MAKE OPERATING AND STRATEGIC DECISIONS, INCLUDING THE PREPARATION OF OUR ANNUAL OPERATING PLAN, EVALUATION OF OUR OVERALL BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND AS A FACTOR IN DETERMINING COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. WE BELIEVE PRESENTING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THIS FORM 10-Q PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO FACILITATE COMPARISON OF OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS AND TRENDS IN OUR UNDERLYING OPERATING RESULTS, AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY ON HOW WE EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS. WE ALSO BELIEVE PRESENTING THESE MEASURES IN THIS FORM 10-Q ALLOWS INVESTORS TO VIEW OUR PERFORMANCE USING THE SAME MEASURES THAT WE USE IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS.  WE CONSIDER QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS IN ASSESSING WHETHER TO ADJUST FOR THE IMPACT OF ITEMS THAT MAY BE SIGNIFICANT OR THAT COULD AFFECT AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR ONGOING FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OR TRENDS. EXAMPLES OF ITEMS FOR WHICH WE MAY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE.  AMOUNTS RELATED TO MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS OR LOSSES (NON-CASH); CHARGES RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS; CHARGES OR ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE ENACTMENT OF NEW LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS, SUCH AS SIGNIFICANT TAX LAW CHANGES; AMOUNTS RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF TAX POSITIONS; TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO REORGANIZATIONS OF OUR OPERATIONS; AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND OTHER STRUCTURAL CHANGES; DEBT REDEMPTIONS, CASH TENDER OR EXCHANGE OFFERS; PENSION AND RETIREE MEDICAL RELATED ITEMS; ASSET IMPAIRMENTS (NON-CASH); AND REMEASUREMENTS OF NET MONETARY ASSETS.  SEE BELOW AND \u201cITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY\u201d FOR A DESCRIPTION OF ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  NON-GAAP INFORMATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPLEMENTAL IN NATURE AND IS NOT MEANT TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. IN ADDITION, OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY NOT BE THE SAME AS OR COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR NON-GAAP MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  THE FOLLOWING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-Q.  \u2022  COST OF SALES,  GROSS PROFIT, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, OTHER PENSION AND RETIREE MEDICAL BENEFITS INCOME, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, EACH ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY  ;  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  OPERATING PROFIT, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PEPSICO PER COMMON SHARE \u2013 DILUTED, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND THE CORRESPONDING CONSTANT CURRENCY GROWTH RATES  ;  \u2022  ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH; AND  \u2022  FREE CASH FLOW.  COST OF SALES,  GROSS PROFIT, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, OTHER PENSION AND RETIREE MEDICAL BENEFITS INCOME, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, EACH ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY  ,  OPERATING PROFIT, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PEPSICO PER COMMON SHARE \u2013 DILUTED, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND THE CORRESPONDING CONSTANT CURRENCY GROWTH RATES  THESE MEASURES EXCLUDE THE NET IMPACT OF MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON CENTRALLY MANAGED COMMODITY DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO OUR 2019 AND 2014 PRODUCTIVITY PLANS, INVENTORY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND MERGER AND INTEGRATION CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF SODASTREAM, TAX BENEFITS/NET TAX EXPENSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE TCJ ACT AND A TAX BENEFIT (SEE \u201cITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY\u201d FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF THESE ITEMS). WE ALSO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE ON OPERATING PROFIT, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PEPSICO PER COMMON SHARE  \u2013  DILUTED, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, WHICH MEASURE OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ASSUMING CONSTANT FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES USED FOR TRANSLATION BASED ON THE RATES IN EFFECT FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. IN ORDER TO COMPUTE OUR CONSTANT CURRENCY RESULTS, WE MULTIPLY OR DIVIDE, AS APPROPRIATE, OUR CURRENT-YEAR U.S. DOLLAR RESULTS BY THE CURRENT-YEAR AVERAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND THEN MULTIPLY OR DIVIDE, AS APPROPRIATE, THOSE AMOUNTS BY THE PRIOR-YEAR AVERAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. WE BELIEVE THESE MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION IN EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY EXCLUDE ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING PERFORMANCE.  ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH  WE DEFINE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AS NET REVENUE GROWTH ADJUSTED FOR THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT FROM ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND OTHER STRUCTURAL CHANGES. WE BELIEVE ORGANIC REVENUE PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION IN EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF ONGOING PERFORMANCE OR THAT WE BELIEVE IMPACT COMPARABILITY WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.  SEE \u201cNET REVENUE AND ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH\u201d IN \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \u2013  DIVISION REVIEW\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  FREE CASH FLOW  WE DEFINE FREE CASH FLOW AS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS CAPITAL SPENDING, PLUS SALES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. SINCE NET CAPITAL SPENDING IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR PRODUCT INNOVATION INITIATIVES AND MAINTAINING OUR OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS A RECURRING AND NECESSARY USE OF CASH. AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE INVESTORS SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER NET CAPITAL SPENDING WHEN EVALUATING OUR CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF CASH AVAILABLE TO FUND CASH OUTFLOWS, SUCH AS OUR ANTICIPATED SHARE REPURCHASES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, DEBT REPAYMENTS AND TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY UNDER THE TCJ ACT, INCLUDE CASH FROM OPERATIONS, PROCEEDS OBTAINED FROM ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM DEBT, AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

AS OF  JUNE 15, 2019  , CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO CURRENCY CONTROLS OR CURRENCY EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS WERE NOT MATERIAL.  THE TCJ ACT IMPOSED A MANDATORY ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON UNDISTRIBUTED INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS. AS OF  JUNE 15, 2019  , OUR MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY WAS $3.4 BILLION. UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE TCJ ACT, THIS TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY MUST BE PAID OVER EIGHT YEARS.

THE OPERATING CASH FLOW PERFORMANCE PRIMARILY REFLECTS DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS OF $1.6 BILLION TO OUR PENSION AND RETIREE MEDICAL PLANS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE NET WORKING CAPITAL COMPARISONS TO 2018 AND HIGHER NET CASH TAX PAYMENTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  24  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $3.3 BILLION  , PRIMARILY REFLECTING $1.9 BILLION OF CASH PAID IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF SODASTREAM, AS WELL AS NET CAPITAL SPENDING OF $1.1 BILLION.  WE EXPECT  2019  NET CAPITAL SPENDING TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $4.5 BILLION.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  24  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , NET CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $5.4 BILLION  , PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE RETURN OF OPERATING CASH FLOW TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES OF  $4.4 BILLION  AND PAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT BORROWINGS OF  $3.0 BILLION  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $1.1 BILLION  AND NET PROCEEDS OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS OF $0.7 BILLION.  WE ANNUALLY REVIEW OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE WITH OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, INCLUDING OUR DIVIDEND POLICY AND SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A MARYLAND CORPORATION  THAT HAS ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A BDC UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, AS AMENDED (THE \u201c1940 ACT\u201d). OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE ATTRACTIVE RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS BY GENERATING CURRENT INCOME AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL  APPRECIATION FROM OUR INVESTMENTS. WE INVEST PRIMARILY IN SENIOR AND UNITRANCHE LEVERAGED LOANS AND MEZZANINE DEBT ISSUED BY PRIVATE U.S.    MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES, WHICH WE DEFINE AS COMPANIES HAVING EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST,  TAX, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) OF BETWEEN $2 MILLION AND $50 MILLION, BOTH THROUGH DIRECT LENDING AND THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN LOAN SYNDICATES. WE MAY ALSO INVEST UP TO 30.0% OF THE PORTFOLIO IN OPPORTUNISTIC  INVESTMENTS IN ORDER TO SEEK TO ENHANCE RETURNS TO STOCKHOLDERS. SUCH INVESTMENTS MAY INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN DISTRESSED DEBT, WHICH MAY INCLUDE SECURITIES OF COMPANIES IN BANKRUPTCY, FOREIGN DEBT, PRIVATE EQUITY, SECURITIES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT  ARE NOT THINLY TRADED AND STRUCTURED FINANCE VEHICLES SUCH AS COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATION FUNDS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO CURRENT INTENTION TO DO SO, TO THE EXTENT WE INVEST IN PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, WE WILL LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES THAT ARE  EXCLUDED FROM THE DEFINITION OF \u201cINVESTMENT COMPANY\u201d UNDER SECTION 3(C)(1) OR SECTION 3(C)(7) OF THE 1940 ACT, WHICH INCLUDES PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, TO NO MORE THAN 15.0% OF ITS NET ASSETS.

AS OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER AND CHANGED OUR NAME TO SARATOGA INVESTMENT CORP.  AS A RESULT OF THE EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER A REVOLVING SECURITIZED CREDIT FACILITY WITH DEUTSCHE BANK WE PREVIOUSLY HAD IN PLACE, IN DECEMBER  2008 WE ENGAGED THE INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM OF STIFEL, NICOLAUS &  77  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMPANY TO EVALUATE STRATEGIC TRANSACTION OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES FOR US.

WE HAVE IDENTIFIED INVESTMENT VALUATION, REVENUE RECOGNITION AND THE RECOGNITION OF CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE EXPENSE AS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES. WE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED  TO THE MATTERS DESCRIBED BELOW. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO US AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM  THOSE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. A DISCUSSION OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOLLOWS.  INVESTMENT VALUATION  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD  (\u201cFASB\u201d) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 820,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURES  (\u201cASC 820\u201d). ASC 820 DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FAIR  VALUE HIERARCHY BASED ON THE QUALITY OF INPUTS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE AND ENHANCES DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. ASC 820 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO ASSUME THAT ITS INVESTMENTS ARE TO BE SOLD OR ITS LIABILITIES ARE TO BE  TRANSFERRED AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE IN THE PRINCIPAL MARKET TO INDEPENDENT MARKET PARTICIPANTS, OR IN THE ABSENCE OF A PRINCIPAL MARKET, IN THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET, WHICH MAY BE A HYPOTHETICAL MARKET. MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE DEFINED AS BUYERS  AND SELLERS IN THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET THAT ARE INDEPENDENT, KNOWLEDGEABLE, AND WILLING AND ABLE TO TRANSACT.  INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE READILY AVAILABLE ARE FAIR VALUED AT SUCH MARKET QUOTATIONS OBTAINED FROM INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY  PRICING SERVICES AND MARKET MAKERS SUBJECT TO ANY DECISION BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO APPROVE A FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION TO REFLECT SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFFECTING THE VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS. WE VALUE INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE  NOT READILY AVAILABLE AT FAIR VALUE AS APPROVED, IN GOOD FAITH, BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS BASED ON INPUT FROM SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND A THIRD PARTY INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM. DETERMINATIONS OF  FAIR VALUE MAY INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES. THE TYPES OF FACTORS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS INCLUDE THE NATURE AND REALIZABLE VALUE OF ANY COLLATERAL, THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY  TO MAKE PAYMENTS, MARKET YIELD TREND ANALYSIS, THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY DOES BUSINESS, COMPARISON TO PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS.  WE UNDERTAKE A MULTI-STEP VALUATION PROCESS EACH QUARTER WHEN VALUING INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE, AS  DESCRIBED BELOW.  \u2022  EACH INVESTMENT IS INITIALLY VALUED BY THE RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS OF SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS  AND PRELIMINARY VALUATION CONCLUSIONS ARE DOCUMENTED AND DISCUSSED WITH OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT; AND  \u2022  AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM ENGAGED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWS A SELECTION OF THESE  PRELIMINARY VALUATIONS EACH QUARTER SO THAT THE VALUATION OF EACH INVESTMENT FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE IS REVIEWED BY THE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM AT LEAST ONCE EACH FISCAL YEAR. WE USE A PARTY INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM TO  VALUE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE SUBORDINATED NOTES OF SARATOGA CLO AND THE  CLASS F-R-2  NOTES AND  CLASS G-R-2  NOTES TRANCHES OF THE SARATOGA CLOS EVERY QUARTER.  IN ADDITION, ALL OUR INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING VALUATION PROCESS.  \u2022  THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEWS AND APPROVES EACH PRELIMINARY VALUATION AND SARATOGA  INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM (IF APPLICABLE) WILL SUPPLEMENT THE PRELIMINARY VALUATION TO REFLECT ANY COMMENTS PROVIDED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE; AND  80  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSES THE VALUATIONS AND APPROVES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH INVESTMENT, IN GOOD FAITH,  BASED ON THE INPUT OF SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM (TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE) AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS BASED ON A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT UTILIZES PREPAYMENT,  RE-  INVESTMENT AND LOSS ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND PROJECTED PERFORMANCE, ECONOMIC FACTORS, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING CASH FLOW, AND COMPARABLE YIELDS FOR EQUITY INTERESTS IN  COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATION FUNDS SIMILAR TO SARATOGA CLO, WHEN AVAILABLE, AS DETERMINED BY SIA AND RECOMMENDED TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. SPECIFICALLY, WE USE INTEX CASH FLOW MODELS, OR AN APPROPRIATE SUBSTITUTE, TO FORM THE BASIS FOR THE  VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO. THE MODELS USE A SET OF ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING PROJECTED DEFAULT RATES, RECOVERY RATES, REINVESTMENT RATE AND PREPAYMENT RATES IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT ESTIMATED VALUATIONS. THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON  AVAILABLE MARKET DATA AND PROJECTIONS PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES. WE USE THE OUTPUT FROM THE INTEX MODELS (I.E., THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS) TO PERFORM A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO  DETERMINE A VALUATION FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  INCOME RECOGNITION  INTEREST INCOME,  ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUM AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNT, IS RECORDED ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. THE COMPANY STOPS ACCRUING INTEREST ON ITS INVESTMENTS WHEN IT IS DETERMINED THAT INTEREST  IS NO LONGER COLLECTIBLE. DISCOUNTS AND PREMIUMS ON INVESTMENTS PURCHASED ARE ACCRETED/AMORTIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE RESPECTIVE INVESTMENT USING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD. THE AMORTIZED COST OF INVESTMENTS REPRESENTS THE ORIGINAL COST ADJUSTED FOR  THE ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS AND AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS ON INVESTMENTS.  LOANS ARE GENERALLY PLACED ON  NON-ACCRUAL  STATUS WHEN THERE IS REASONABLE DOUBT THAT PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST WILL BE COLLECTED. ACCRUED INTEREST IS GENERALLY RESERVED WHEN A LOAN IS PLACED ON  NON-ACCRUAL  STATUS. INTEREST PAYMENTS RECEIVED ON  NON-ACCRUAL  LOANS MAY BE RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION IN PRINCIPAL DEPENDING UPON MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT REGARDING  COLLECTABILITY.  NON-ACCRUAL  LOANS ARE RESTORED TO ACCRUAL STATUS WHEN PAST DUE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS PAID AND, IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT, ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN CURRENT, ALTHOUGH WE MAY MAKE EXCEPTIONS  TO THIS GENERAL RULE IF THE LOAN HAS SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL VALUE AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION.  PAYMENT-IN-KIND  INTEREST  THE COMPANY HOLDS DEBT AND PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN ITS  PORTFOLIO THAT CONTAIN A  PAYMENT-IN-KIND  (\u201cPIK\u201d) INTEREST PROVISION.  THE PIK INTEREST, WHICH REPRESENTS CONTRACTUALLY DEFERRED INTEREST ADDED TO THE INVESTMENT BALANCE THAT IS GENERALLY DUE AT MATURITY, IS  GENERALLY RECORDED ON THE ACCRUAL BASIS TO THE EXTENT SUCH AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. WE STOP ACCRUING PIK INTEREST IF WE DO NOT EXPECT THE ISSUER TO BE ABLE TO PAY ALL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WHEN DUE.  REVENUES  WE GENERATE REVENUE IN  THE FORM OF INTEREST INCOME AND CAPITAL GAINS ON THE DEBT INVESTMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, ON EQUITY INTERESTS THAT WE MAY ACQUIRE. WE EXPECT OUR DEBT INVESTMENTS, WHETHER IN THE FORM OF LEVERAGED LOANS OR MEZZANINE DEBT, TO HAVE  TERMS OF UP TO TEN YEARS, AND TO BEAR INTEREST AT EITHER A FIXED OR FLOATING RATE. INTEREST ON DEBT WILL BE PAYABLE GENERALLY EITHER QUARTERLY OR SEMI-ANNUALLY. IN SOME CASES, OUR DEBT OR PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR A PORTION OR ALL  OF THE INTEREST TO BE PIK. TO THE EXTENT INTEREST IS PIK, IT WILL BE PAYABLE THROUGH THE INCREASE OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE OBLIGATION BY THE AMOUNT OF  81  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST DUE ON THE THEN-OUTSTANDING AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SUCH OBLIGATION. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE DEBT AND ANY ACCRUED BUT UNPAID INTEREST WILL GENERALLY BECOME DUE AT THE MATURITY  DATE. IN ADDITION, WE MAY GENERATE REVENUE IN THE FORM OF COMMITMENT, ORIGINATION, STRUCTURING OR DILIGENCE FEES, FEES FOR PROVIDING MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE OR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND POSSIBLY CONSULTING FEES. ANY SUCH FEES WILL BE  GENERATED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INVESTMENTS AND RECOGNIZED AS EARNED. WE MAY ALSO INVEST IN PREFERRED EQUITY OR COMMON EQUITY SECURITIES THAT PAY DIVIDENDS ON A CURRENT BASIS.  ON JANUARY 22, 2008, WE ENTERED INTO A COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH SARATOGA CLO, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE ACT AS ITS COLLATERAL  MANAGER. THE SARATOGA CLO WAS INITIALLY REFINANCED IN OCTOBER 2013 WITH ITS REINVESTMENT PERIOD EXTENDED TO OCTOBER 2016. ON NOVEMBER 15, 2016, WE COMPLETED A SECOND REFINANCING OF THE SARATOGA CLO WITH ITS REINVESTMENT PERIOD EXTENDED TO  OCTOBER 2018.  ON DECEMBER 14, 2018, WE COMPLETED A THIRD REFINANCING AND UPSIZE OF THE SARATOGA CLO. THE THIRD SARATOGA CLO  REFINANCING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EXTENDED ITS REINVESTMENT PERIOD TO JANUARY 2021, AND EXTENDED ITS LEGAL MATURITY DATE TO JANUARY 2030. A  NON-CALL  PERIOD OF JANUARY 2020 WAS ALSO ADDED. FOLLOWING THIS  REFINANCING, THE SARATOGA CLO PORTFOLIO INCREASED FROM APPROXIMATELY $300.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT TO APPROXIMATELY $500.0 MILLION OF PREDOMINANTLY SENIOR SECURED FIRST LIEN TERM LOANS. IN ADDITION TO REFINANCING ITS  LIABILITIES, WE INVESTED AN ADDITIONAL $13.8 MILLION IN ALL OF THE NEWLY ISSUED SUBORDINATED NOTES OF THE SARATOGA CLO AND ALSO PURCHASED $2.5 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE  CLASS F-R-2  AND $7.5 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE  CLASS G-R-2  NOTES TRANCHES AT PAR, WITH A  COUPON OF LIBOR PLUS 8.75% AND LIBOR PLUS 10.00%, RESPECTIVELY. AS PART OF THIS REFINANCING, WE ALSO REDEEMED OUR EXISTING $4.5 MILLION AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE CLASS F NOTES TRANCHE AT PAR.  THE SARATOGA CLO REMAINS EFFECTIVELY 100% OWNED AND MANAGED BY SARATOGA INVESTMENT CORP. WE RECEIVE A BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.10% PER ANNUM  AND A SUBORDINATED MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.40% PER ANNUM OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SARATOGA CLO\u2019S ASSETS, PAID QUARTERLY TO THE EXTENT OF AVAILABLE PROCEEDS. PRIOR TO THE SECOND REFINANCING AND THE ISSUANCE OF THE  2013-1  AMENDED CLO NOTES, WE RECEIVED A BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.25% PER ANNUM AND A SUBORDINATED MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.25% PER ANNUM OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SARATOGA CLO\u2019S ASSETS, PAID QUARTERLY  TO THE EXTENT OF AVAILABLE PROCEEDS.  FOLLOWING THE THIRD REFINANCING AND THE ISSUANCE OF THE  2013-1  RESET CLO NOTES ON DECEMBER 14, 2018, WE ARE NO LONGER ENTITLED TO AN INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE EQUAL TO 20.0% OF EXCESS CASH FLOW TO THE EXTENT THE SARATOGA CLO SUBORDINATED NOTES RECEIVE AN  INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN PAID IN CASH EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 12.0%.  INTEREST INCOME ON OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO IS RECORDED USING  THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ASC TOPIC  325-40,  INVESTMENTS-OTHER, BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS  (\u201cASC  325-40\u201d),  BASED ON THE ANTICIPATED YIELD AND THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS OVER THE PROJECTED LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT. YIELDS ARE REVISED WHEN THERE ARE CHANGES IN ACTUAL OR ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS DUE TO CHANGES  IN PREPAYMENTS AND/OR  RE-INVESTMENTS,  CREDIT LOSSES OR ASSET PRICING. CHANGES IN ESTIMATED YIELD ARE RECOGNIZED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE ESTIMATED YIELD OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT FROM THE DATE  THE ESTIMATED YIELD WAS CHANGED.  ASC 606  IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ASU  2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (\u201cASC  606\u201d), WHICH SUPERSEDES THE REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS IN REVENUE RECOGNITION (ASC 605). UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT  REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN MAY 2016, ASU  2016-12  AMENDED ASU  2014-09  AND DEFERRED  THE EFFECTIVE PERIOD FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017. MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE MAJORITY OF ITS REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE SCOPED OUT OF ASC 606, AND HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT  IMPACT RELATES TO THE TIMING OF THE RECOGNITION OF THE CLO INCENTIVE FEE INCOME. WE ADOPTED ASC 606 UNDER THE MODIFIED  82  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH USING THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT PROVIDED FOR, THEREFORE THE PRESENTATION OF PRIOR PERIODS HAS NOT BEEN ADJUSTED.  EXPENSES  OUR PRIMARY OPERATING  EXPENSES INCLUDE THE PAYMENT OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT FEES, PROFESSIONAL FEES, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INSURANCE, FEES PAID TO INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND ADMINISTRATOR EXPENSES, INCLUDING OUR ALLOCABLE PORTION OF OUR ADMINISTRATOR\u2019S  OVERHEAD. OUR INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT FEES COMPENSATE OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER FOR ITS WORK IN IDENTIFYING, EVALUATING, NEGOTIATING, CLOSING AND MONITORING OUR INVESTMENTS. WE BEAR ALL OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES OF OUR OPERATIONS AND  TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO.  \u2022  ORGANIZATION;  \u2022  CALCULATING OUR NET ASSET VALUE (INCLUDING THE COST AND EXPENSES OF ANY INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM);  \u2022  EXPENSES INCURRED BY OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING AGENTS, CONSULTANTS OR OTHER  ADVISERS, IN MONITORING OUR FINANCIAL AND LEGAL AFFAIRS AND IN MONITORING OUR INVESTMENTS AND PERFORMING DUE DILIGENCE ON OUR PROSPECTIVE PORTFOLIO COMPANIES;  \u2022  EXPENSES INCURRED BY OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER PAYABLE FOR TRAVEL AND DUE DILIGENCE ON OUR PROSPECTIVE PORTFOLIO  COMPANIES;  \u2022  INTEREST PAYABLE ON DEBT, IF ANY, INCURRED TO FINANCE OUR INVESTMENTS;  \u2022  OFFERINGS OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES;  \u2022  INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT FEES;  \u2022  FEES PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING AGENTS, CONSULTANTS OR OTHER ADVISERS, RELATING TO, OR ASSOCIATED WITH,  EVALUATING AND MAKING INVESTMENTS;  \u2022  TRANSFER AGENT AND CUSTODIAL FEES;  \u2022  FEDERAL AND STATE REGISTRATION FEES;  \u2022  ALL COSTS OF REGISTRATION AND LISTING OUR COMMON STOCK ON ANY SECURITIES EXCHANGE;  \u2022  FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES;  \u2022  INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS\u2019 FEES AND EXPENSES;  \u2022  COSTS OF PREPARING AND FILING REPORTS OR OTHER DOCUMENTS REQUIRED BY GOVERNMENTAL BODIES (INCLUDING THE U.S.  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) AND THE SBA);  \u2022  COSTS OF ANY REPORTS, PROXY STATEMENTS OR OTHER NOTICES TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDING PRINTING COSTS;  \u2022  OUR FIDELITY BOND, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS ERRORS AND OMISSIONS LIABILITY INSURANCE, AND ANY OTHER INSURANCE  PREMIUMS;  \u2022  DIRECT COSTS AND EXPENSES OF ADMINISTRATION, INCLUDING PRINTING, MAILING, LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE, COPYING,  SECRETARIAL AND OTHER STAFF, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS AND OUTSIDE LEGAL COSTS; AND  \u2022  ADMINISTRATION FEES AND ALL OTHER EXPENSES INCURRED BY US OR, IF APPLICABLE, THE ADMINISTRATOR IN CONNECTION WITH  ADMINISTERING OUR BUSINESS (INCLUDING PAYMENTS UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT BASED UPON OUR ALLOCABLE PORTION OF THE ADMINISTRATOR\u2019S OVERHEAD IN PERFORMING ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER AN ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT, INCLUDING RENT AND THE ALLOCABLE  PORTION OF THE COST OF OUR OFFICERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE STAFFS (INCLUDING TRAVEL EXPENSES)).  PURSUANT TO THE INVESTMENT  ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT THAT WE HAD WITH GSCP (NJ), L.P., OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER AND ADMINISTRATOR, WE HAD AGREED TO PAY GSCP (NJ), L.P. AS INVESTMENT ADVISER A  83  TABLE OF CONTENTS  QUARTERLY BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OF 1.75% OF THE AVERAGE VALUE OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS (OTHER THAN CASH OR CASH EQUIVALENTS BUT INCLUDING ASSETS PURCHASED WITH BORROWED FUNDS) AT THE END OF THE TWO MOST  RECENTLY COMPLETED FISCAL QUARTERS AND AN INCENTIVE FEE.  THE INCENTIVE FEE HAD TWO PARTS.  \u2022  A FEE, PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ARREARS, EQUAL TO 20.0% OF OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPRESSED AS A RATE OF RETURN ON THE VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS AT THE END OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING QUARTER, THAT EXCEEDED A 1.875% QUARTERLY HURDLE RATE MEASURED AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER. UNDER THIS  PROVISION, IN ANY FISCAL QUARTER, OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER RECEIVED NO INCENTIVE FEE UNLESS OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME EXCEEDED THE HURDLE RATE OF 1.875%. AMOUNTS RECEIVED AS A RETURN OF CAPITAL  WERE NOT INCLUDED IN CALCULATING THIS PORTION OF THE INCENTIVE FEE. SINCE THE HURDLE RATE WAS BASED ON NET ASSETS, A RETURN OF LESS THAN THE HURDLE RATE ON TOTAL ASSETS COULD STILL HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCENTIVE FEE.  \u2022  A FEE, PAYABLE AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, EQUAL TO 20.0% OF OUR NET REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, COMPUTED  NET OF ALL REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES AND UNREALIZED CAPITAL DEPRECIATION, IN EACH CASE ON A CUMULATIVE BASIS ON EACH INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY\u2019S PORTFOLIO, LESS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEES PAID TO THE INVESTMENT ADVISER  THROUGH SUCH DATE.  WE DEFERRED CASH PAYMENT OF ANY INCENTIVE FEE OTHERWISE EARNED BY OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER IF,  DURING THE THEN MOST RECENT FOUR FULL FISCAL QUARTERS ENDING ON OR PRIOR TO THE DATE SUCH PAYMENT WAS TO BE MADE, THE SUM OF (A) OUR AGGREGATE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND (B) OUR CHANGE IN NET ASSETS (DEFINED AS TOTAL ASSETS LESS  LIABILITIES) (BEFORE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY INCENTIVE FEES PAYABLE DURING THAT PERIOD) WAS LESS THAN 7.5% OF OUR NET ASSETS AT THE BEGINNING OF SUCH PERIOD. THESE CALCULATIONS WERE APPROPRIATELY  PRO-RATED  FOR  THE FIRST THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF OPERATION AND ADJUSTED FOR ANY SHARE ISSUANCES OR REPURCHASES DURING THE APPLICABLE PERIOD. SUCH INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BECOME PAYABLE ON THE NEXT DATE ON WHICH SUCH TEST HAD BEEN SATISFIED FOR THE MOST RECENT FOUR  FULL FISCAL QUARTERS OR UPON CERTAIN TERMINATIONS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. WE COMMENCED DEFERRING CASH PAYMENT OF INCENTIVE FEES DURING THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2007 AND CONTINUED TO DEFER SUCH PAYMENTS  THROUGH THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2010. AS OF JULY 30, 2010, THE DATE ON WHICH GSCP (NJ), L.P. CEASED TO BE OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER AND ADMINISTRATOR, WE OWED GSCP (NJ), L.P. $2.9 MILLION IN FEES FOR SERVICES PREVIOUSLY  PROVIDED TO US; OF WHICH $0.3 MILLION HAS BEEN PAID BY US. GSCP (NJ), L.P. AGREED TO WAIVE PAYMENT BY US OF THE REMAINING $2.6 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSUMMATION OF THE STOCK PURCHASE TRANSACTION WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS  AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT.  THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT  WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT ADVISER, ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WE HAD ENTERED INTO WITH GSCP (NJ), L.P., OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER, EXCEPT FOR THE  FOLLOWING MATERIAL DISTINCTIONS IN THE FEE TERMS.  \u2022  THE CAPITAL GAINS PORTION OF THE INCENTIVE FEE WAS RESET WITH RESPECT TO GAINS AND LOSSES FROM MAY 31, 2010,  AND THEREFORE LOSSES AND GAINS INCURRED PRIOR TO SUCH TIME WILL NOT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN CALCULATING THE CAPITAL GAINS FEE PAYABLE TO SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND, AS A RESULT, SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS WILL BE ENTITLED TO 20.0% OF NET  GAINS THAT ARISE AFTER MAY 31, 2010. IN ADDITION, THE COST BASIS FOR COMPUTING REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS HELD BY US AS OF MAY 31, 2010 EQUAL THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENT AS OF SUCH DATE. UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY  AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER, GSCP (NJ), L.P., THE CAPITAL GAINS FEE WAS CALCULATED FROM MARCH 21, 2007, AND THE GAINS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY OUTWEIGHED BY LOSSES.  \u2022  UNDER THE \u201cCATCH UP\u201d PROVISION, 100.0% OF OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE  NET INVESTMENT INCOME WITH RESPECT TO THAT PORTION OF SUCH  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME THAT EXCEEDS 1.875% BUT IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 2.344% IN ANY FISCAL QUARTER IS PAYABLE TO SARATOGA  INVESTMENT ADVISORS.

CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE  THE COMPANY RECORDS AN EXPENSE ACCRUAL RELATING TO THE CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE PAYABLE BY THE COMPANY TO ITS MANAGER WHEN THE UNREALIZED  GAINS ON ITS INVESTMENTS EXCEED ALL REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES ON ITS INVESTMENTS GIVEN THE FACT THAT A CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BE OWED TO THE MANAGER IF THE COMPANY WERE TO LIQUIDATE ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT SUCH TIME. THE ACTUAL  INCENTIVE FEE PAYABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGER RELATED TO CAPITAL GAINS WILL BE DETERMINED AND PAYABLE IN ARREARS AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR AND WILL INCLUDE ONLY REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS FOR THE PERIOD.  REGULATORY MATTERS  IN AUGUST 2018, THE  SEC ISSUED FINAL RULE RELEASE  NO.33-10532,  DISCLOSURE UPDATE AND SIMPLIFICATION  , WHICH IN PART AMENDS CERTAIN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF REGULATION  S-X  THAT HAVE  BECOME REDUNDANT, DUPLICATIVE, OVERLAPPING, OUTDATED, OR SUPERSEDED, IN LIGHT OF OTHER COMMISSION DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, U.S. GAAP OR CHANGES IN THE INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT. THE AMENDMENTS ARE INTENDED TO FACILITATE THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION  TO INVESTORS AND SIMPLIFY COMPLIANCE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERING THE TOTAL MIX OF INFORMATION PROVIDED TO INVESTORS. THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR THESE DISCLOSURES WAS NOVEMBER 5, 2018, EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER THAT BEGINS AFTER THE  EFFECTIVE DATE. MANAGEMENT HAS ADOPTED THESE AMENDMENTS AS CURRENTLY REQUIRED AND THESE ARE REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.

THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF ASU  2018-13  IS TO IMPROVE THE  EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE CHANGES AFFECT ALL COMPANIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT DISCLOSURES. IN GENERAL, THE AMENDMENTS IN ASU  2018-13  ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL ENTITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019. AN ENTITY IS PERMITTED TO EARLY ADOPT THE REMOVED OR MODIFIED  DISCLOSURES UPON THE ISSUANCE OF ASU  2018-13  AND MAY DELAY ADOPTION OF THE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, WHICH ARE REQUIRED FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES ONLY, UNTIL THEIR EFFECTIVE DATE. MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THESE  CHANGES AND DOES NOT BELIEVE THEY WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES.  IN MARCH 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU  2017-08,  RECEIVABLES \u2014 NONREFUNDABLE FEES AND OTHER COSTS  (SUBTOPIC  310-20),  PREMIUM AMORTIZATION ON PURCHASED CALLABLE DEBT SECURITIES  (\u201cASU  2017-08\u201d)  WHICH AMENDS THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR CERTAIN PURCHASED  CALLABLE DEBT SECURITIES HELD AT A PREMIUM, SHORTENING SUCH PERIOD TO THE EARLIEST CALL DATE. ASU  2017-08  DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY ACCOUNTING CHANGE FOR DEBT SECURITIES HELD AT A DISCOUNT; THE DISCOUNT CONTINUES  TO BE AMORTIZED TO MATURITY. ASU  2017-08  IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THESE CHANGES AND  CONCLUDED THESE CHANGES DO NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES.  85  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW  MAY 31, 2019  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  ($ IN MILLIONS)  NUMBER OF INVESTMENTS(1)  66  58  NUMBER OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES(2)  33  31  AVERAGE INVESTMENT PER PORTFOLIO COMPANY(2)  $11.3  $11.8  AVERAGE INVESTMENT SIZE(1)  $5.8  $6.5  WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY(3)  3.5YRS  3.6YRS  NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES  8  8  NON-PERFORMING  OR DELINQUENT INVESTMENTS (FAIR  VALUE)  $4.8  $5.7  FIXED RATE DEBT (% OF INTEREST EARNING PORTFOLIO)(3)  $56.8(16.7%)  $55.7(16.3%)  FIXED RATE DEBT (WEIGHTED AVERAGE CURRENT COUPON)(3)  10.4%  10.4%  FLOATING RATE DEBT (% OF INTEREST EARNING PORTFOLIO)(3)  $284.0(83.3%)  $285.0(83.7%)  FLOATING RATE DEBT (WEIGHTED AVERAGE CURRENT SPREAD OVER LIBOR)(3)(4)  8.5%  8.6%  (1)  EXCLUDES OUR INVESTMENT IN THE SUBORDINATED NOTES OF SARATOGA CLO.

FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AND MAY 31, 2018, THE AVERAGE BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING OF SBA DEBENTURES WAS $150.0 MILLION AND $137.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31,  2019 AND MAY 31, 2018, THERE WERE INCOME TAX BENEFITS OF $0.0 MILLION AND $0.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THIS RELATES TO NET DEFERRED FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX BENEFITS WITH RESPECT TO OPERATING LOSSES AND INCOME DERIVED FROM EQUITY  INVESTMENTS HELD IN TAXABLE BLOCKERS.

THE $0.7 MILLION OF NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED APPRECIATION IN OUR INVESTMENT IN EASY ICE, LLC WAS DRIVEN BY A CONTINUED INCREASE IN THE  SCALE AND EARNINGS OF THE BUSINESS.

CHANGES IN NET ASSETS RESULTING FROM OPERATIONS  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AND MAY 31, 2018, WE RECORDED A NET INCREASE IN NET ASSETS RESULTING FROM OPERATIONS OF  $7.6 MILLION AND $3.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON 7,746,187 WEIGHTED AVERAGE  93  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING AS OF MAY 31, 2019, OUR PER SHARE NET INCREASE IN NET ASSETS RESULTING FROM OPERATIONS WAS $0.99 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019. THIS COMPARES TO A  PER SHARE NET INCREASE IN NET ASSETS RESULTING FROM OPERATIONS OF $0.61 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018 BASED ON 6,275,494 WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING AS OF MAY 31, 2018.  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE CASH PRIMARILY FROM CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING INTEREST EARNED FROM OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT IN  MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES, INTEREST EARNED FROM THE TEMPORARY INVESTMENT OF CASH IN U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES AND OTHER HIGH-QUALITY DEBT INVESTMENTS THAT MATURE IN ONE YEAR OR LESS, FUTURE BORROWINGS AND FUTURE OFFERINGS OF SECURITIES.  ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT TO FUND THE GROWTH OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO THROUGH THE NET PROCEEDS FROM FUTURE EQUITY OFFERINGS, INCLUDING OUR  DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (\u201cDRIP\u201d), AND ISSUANCES OF SENIOR SECURITIES OR FUTURE BORROWINGS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE 1940 ACT, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR PLANS TO RAISE CAPITAL WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. IN THIS REGARD, BECAUSE OUR  COMMON STOCK HAS HISTORICALLY TRADED AT A PRICE BELOW OUR CURRENT NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE AND WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE BELOW NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE, WE HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE LIMITED IN OUR  ABILITY TO RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL.  IN ADDITION, WE INTEND TO DISTRIBUTE TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME IN  ORDER TO SATISFY THE DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT APPLICABLE TO RICS UNDER THE CODE. IN SATISFYING THIS DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT, WE HAVE IN THE PAST RELIED ON INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (\u201cIRS\u201d) ISSUED PRIVATE LETTER RULINGS CONCLUDING THAT A  RIC MAY TREAT A DISTRIBUTION OF ITS OWN STOCK AS FULFILLING ITS RIC DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS IF EACH STOCKHOLDER MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE HIS OR HER ENTIRE DISTRIBUTION IN EITHER CASH OR STOCK OF THE RIC SUBJECT TO A LIMITATION ON THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT  OF CASH TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH LIMITATION MUST BE AT LEAST 20.0% OF THE AGGREGATE DECLARED DISTRIBUTION. WE MAY RELY ON THESE IRS PRIVATE LETTER RULINGS IN FUTURE PERIODS TO SATISFY OUR RIC DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT.  ALSO, AS A BDC, WE GENERALLY ARE REQUIRED TO MEET A COVERAGE RATIO OF TOTAL ASSETS, LESS LIABILITIES AND INDEBTEDNESS NOT REPRESENTED BY  SENIOR SECURITIES, TO TOTAL SENIOR SECURITIES, WHICH INCLUDE ALL OF OUR BORROWINGS AND ANY OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK, OF AT LEAST 200.0%, REDUCED TO 150.0% EFFECTIVE APRIL 16, 2019 FOLLOWING THE APPROVAL RECEIVED FROM THE  NON-INTERESTED  BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON APRIL 16, 2018. THIS REQUIREMENT LIMITS THE AMOUNT THAT WE MAY BORROW. OUR ASSET COVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN THE 1940 ACT, WAS 238.9% AS OF MAY 31, 2019 AND 234.5% AS  OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019. TO FUND GROWTH IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IN THE FUTURE, WE ANTICIPATE NEEDING TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FROM VARIOUS SOURCES, INCLUDING THE EQUITY MARKETS AND OTHER DEBT-RELATED MARKETS, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE  AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL.  CONSEQUENTLY, WE MAY NOT HAVE THE FUNDS OR THE ABILITY TO FUND NEW INVESTMENTS, TO MAKE  ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, TO FUND OUR UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO PORTFOLIO COMPANIES OR TO REPAY BORROWINGS. ALSO, THE ILLIQUIDITY OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO SELL THESE INVESTMENTS WHEN DESIRED  AND, IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO SELL THESE INVESTMENTS, WE MAY REALIZE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THEIR RECORDED VALUE.  MADISON REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF THE TERMS OF THE SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WE ENTERED INTO WITH MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC  (THE \u201cCREDIT FACILITY\u201d) ON JUNE 30, 2010, WHICH WAS MOST RECENTLY AMENDED ON MAY 18, 2017.  AVAILABILITY.  THE  COMPANY CAN DRAW UP TO THE LESSER OF (I) $40.0 MILLION (THE \u201cFACILITY AMOUNT\u201d) AND (II) THE PRODUCT OF THE APPLICABLE ADVANCE RATE (WHICH VARIES FROM 50.0% TO 75.0% DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF LOAN ASSET) AND THE VALUE, DETERMINED  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cADJUSTED BORROWING VALUE\u201d), OF CERTAIN  94  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d LOAN ASSETS PLEDGED AS SECURITY FOR THE LOAN (THE \u201cBORROWING BASE\u201d), IN EACH CASE LESS (A) THE AMOUNT OF ANY UNDRAWN FUNDING COMMITMENTS THE COMPANY HAS UNDER  ANY LOAN ASSET AND WHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY AMOUNTS IN THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT REFERRED TO BELOW (THE \u201cUNFUNDED EXPOSURE AMOUNT\u201d) AND OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS. EACH LOAN ASSET HELD BY THE COMPANY AS OF THE DATE ON WHICH THE CREDIT  FACILITY WAS CLOSED WAS VALUED AS OF THAT DATE AND EACH LOAN ASSET THAT THE COMPANY ACQUIRES AFTER SUCH DATE WILL BE VALUED AT THE LOWEST OF ITS FAIR VALUE, ITS FACE VALUE (EXCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST) AND THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR SUCH LOAN ASSET.  ADJUSTMENTS TO THE VALUE OF A LOAN ASSET WILL BE MADE TO REFLECT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN ITS FAIR VALUE, A DEFAULT BY THE OBLIGOR ON THE LOAN ASSET, INSOLVENCY OF THE OBLIGOR, ACCELERATION OF THE LOAN ASSET, AND CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS TO THE  TERMS OF THE LOAN ASSET.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPE OF LOAN ASSETS THAT ARE \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d TO BE INCLUDED  IN THE BORROWING BASE AND AS TO THE CONCENTRATION LEVEL OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF LOAN ASSETS IN THE BORROWING BASE SUCH AS RESTRICTIONS ON GEOGRAPHIC AND INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS, ASSET SIZE AND QUALITY, PAYMENT FREQUENCY, STATUS AND TERMS, AVERAGE  LIFE, AND COLLATERAL INTERESTS. IN ADDITION, IF AN ASSET IS TO REMAIN AN \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d LOAN ASSET, THE COMPANY MAY NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THE PAYMENT, AMORTIZATION, COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN OTHER TERMS OF THE LOAN ASSETS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE  ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT THAT WILL EITHER RESULT IN SUBORDINATION OF THE LOAN ASSET OR BE MATERIALLY ADVERSE TO THE LENDERS.  COLLATERAL.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY (OTHER THAN ASSETS HELD BY OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY) AND INCLUDES THE SUBORDINATED NOTES (\u201cCLO NOTES\u201d) ISSUED BY SARATOGA CLO AND THE COMPANY\u2019S RIGHTS  UNDER THE CLO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED BELOW).  INTEREST RATE AND FEES.  UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, FUNDS ARE BORROWED FROM  OR THROUGH CERTAIN LENDERS AT THE GREATER OF THE PREVAILING LIBOR RATE AND 1.00%, PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN OF 4.75%. AT THE COMPANY\u2019S OPTION, FUNDS MAY BE BORROWED BASED ON AN ALTERNATIVE BASE RATE, WHICH IN NO EVENT WILL BE LESS THAN 2.00%,  AND THE APPLICABLE MARGIN OVER SUCH ALTERNATIVE BASE RATE IS 3.75%. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PAYS THE LENDERS A COMMITMENT FEE OF 0.75% PER YEAR ON THE UNUSED AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE DURATION OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD (DEFINED BELOW).  ACCRUED INTEREST AND COMMITMENT FEES ARE PAYABLE MONTHLY. THE COMPANY WAS ALSO OBLIGATED TO PAY CERTAIN OTHER FEES TO THE LENDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING OF THE CREDIT FACILITY.  REVOLVING PERIOD AND MATURITY DATE.  THE COMPANY MAY MAKE AND REPAY BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS  FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cREVOLVING PERIOD\u201d). THE REVOLVING PERIOD MAY BE TERMINATED AT AN EARLIER TIME BY THE COMPANY OR, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, BY ACTION OF THE LENDERS OR AUTOMATICALLY. ALL  BORROWINGS AND OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY ARE DUE AND PAYABLE IN FULL FIVE YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD.  COLLATERAL TESTS.  IT IS A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO ANY BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY THAT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER  THE CREDIT FACILITY, AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE PROPOSED BORROWINGS, NOT EXCEED THE LESSER OF THE BORROWING BASE OR THE FACILITY AMOUNT (THE \u201cBORROWING BASE TEST\u201d). IN ADDITION TO SATISFYING THE BORROWING BASE TEST, THE FOLLOWING TESTS  MUST ALSO BE SATISFIED (TOGETHER WITH BORROWING BASE TEST, THE \u201cCOLLATERAL TESTS\u201d).  \u2022  INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO.  THE RATIO (EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE) OF INTEREST COLLECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO  PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS, LESS CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSES RELATING TO THE CREDIT FACILITY, TO ACCRUED INTEREST AND COMMITMENT FEES AND ANY BREAKAGE COSTS PAYABLE TO THE LENDERS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE LAST 6 PAYMENT PERIODS MUST EQUAL AT LEAST  175.0%.  \u2022  OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO.  THE RATIO (EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE) OF THE AGGREGATE ADJUSTED BORROWING  VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS PLUS THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN INELIGIBLE PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS AND THE CLO NOTES (IN EACH CASE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS) TO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY PLUS THE UNFUNDED  EXPOSURE AMOUNT MUST EQUAL AT LEAST 200.0%.  \u2022  WEIGHTED AVERAGE FMV TEST.  THE AGGREGATE ADJUSTED OR WEIGHTED VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN  ASSETS AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE AGGREGATE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS  95  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MUST BE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 72.0% AND 80.0% DURING THE  ONE-YEAR  PERIODS PRIOR TO THE FIRST AND SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE, RESPECTIVELY,  AND 85.0% AT ALL TIMES THEREAFTER.  THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO REQUIRES PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OR REPLACEMENT  OF PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S BREACH OF ITS REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY THAT PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS INCLUDED IN THE BORROWING BASE ARE \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d LOAN ASSETS. SUCH PAYMENTS OR REPLACEMENTS MUST EQUAL THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT  BY WHICH THE BORROWING BASE IS OVERSTATED AS A RESULT OF SUCH BREACH OR ANY DEFICIENCY UNDER THE COLLATERAL TESTS AT THE TIME OF REPAYMENT OR REPLACEMENT. COMPLIANCE WITH THE COLLATERAL TESTS IS ALSO A CONDITION TO THE DISCRETIONARY SALE OF PLEDGED  LOAN ASSETS BY THE COMPANY.  PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS.  DURING THE REVOLVING PERIOD, THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS PROVISIONS OF THE CREDIT  FACILITY REQUIRE, AFTER PAYMENT OF SPECIFIED FEES AND EXPENSES AND ANY NECESSARY FUNDING OF THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT, THAT COLLECTIONS OF PRINCIPAL FROM THE LOAN ASSETS AND, TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE ARE INSUFFICIENT, COLLECTIONS OF INTEREST  FROM THE LOAN ASSETS, BE APPLIED ON EACH PAYMENT DATE TO PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS IF THE BORROWING BASE TEST, THE OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO AND THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE MET. SIMILARLY, FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF  THE REVOLVING PERIOD, COLLECTIONS OF INTEREST ARE REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED, AFTER PAYMENT OF CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSES, TO CURE ANY DEFICIENCIES IN THE BORROWING BASE TEST, THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND THE OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO AS OF THE  RELEVANT PAYMENT DATE.  RESERVE ACCOUNT.  THE CREDIT FACILITY REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO SET ASIDE AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE SUM OF  ACCRUED INTEREST, COMMITMENT FEES AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES DUE AND PAYABLE ON THE NEXT SUCCEEDING THREE PAYMENT DATES (OR CORRESPONDING TO THREE PAYMENT PERIODS). IF FOR ANY MONTHLY PERIOD DURING WHICH FEES AND OTHER PAYMENTS ACCRUE, THE  AGGREGATE ADJUSTED BORROWING VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS WHICH DO NOT PAY CASH INTEREST AT LEAST QUARTERLY EXCEEDS 15.0% OF THE AGGREGATE ADJUSTED BORROWING VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY IS  REQUIRED TO SET ASIDE SUCH INTEREST AND FEES DUE AND PAYABLE ON THE NEXT SUCCEEDING SIX PAYMENT DATES. AMOUNTS IN THE RESERVE ACCOUNT CAN BE APPLIED SOLELY TO THE PAYMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES, COMMITMENT FEES, ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST AND  ANY BREAKAGE COSTS PAYABLE TO THE LENDERS.  UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT.  WITH RESPECT TO REVOLVER OR DELAYED DRAW LOAN ASSETS, THE  COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO SET ASIDE IN A DESIGNATED ACCOUNT (THE \u201cUNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT\u201d) 100.0% OF ITS OUTSTANDING AND UNDRAWN FUNDING COMMITMENTS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH LOAN ASSETS. THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT IS FUNDED AT THE TIME THE  COMPANY ACQUIRES A REVOLVER OR DELAYED DRAW LOAN ASSET AND REQUESTS A RELATED BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT IS FUNDED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PROCEEDS OF THE REQUESTED BORROWING AND OTHER COMPANY FUNDS, AND IF  FOR ANY REASON SUCH AMOUNTS ARE INSUFFICIENT, THROUGH APPLICATION OF THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENT PROVISIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  OPERATING  EXPENSES.  THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS PROVISION OF THE CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES FOR THE PAYMENT OF CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE COMPANY OUT OF COLLECTIONS ON PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST DURING THE REVOLVING PERIOD AND OUT OF COLLECTIONS ON INTEREST  FOLLOWING THE TERMINATION OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRIORITY ESTABLISHED IN SUCH PROVISION. THE OPERATING EXPENSES PAYABLE PURSUANT TO THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENT PROVISIONS IS LIMITED TO $350,000 FOR EACH MONTHLY PAYMENT DATE OR  $2.5 MILLION FOR THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING PERIOD OF TWELVE CONSECUTIVE MONTHLY PAYMENT DATES. THIS CEILING CAN BE INCREASED BY THE LESSER OF 5.0% OR THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ALL THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS ONLY ON THE  FIRST MONTHLY PAYMENT DATE TO OCCUR AFTER EACH  ONE-YEAR  ANNIVERSARY FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE CREDIT FACILITY. UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A MANAGER EVENT (DESCRIBED BELOW), THE CONSENT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO PAY OPERATING EXPENSES THROUGH THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS PROVISION.  EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  THE CREDIT  FACILITY CONTAINS CERTAIN NEGATIVE COVENANTS, CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT. THE CREDIT FACILITY DOES NOT CONTAIN GRACE PERIODS FOR BREACH BY THE COMPANY OF CERTAIN COVENANTS, INCLUDING,  WITHOUT LIMITATION, PRESERVATION OF EXISTENCE, NEGATIVE PLEDGE, CHANGE OF NAME OR JURISDICTION AND SEPARATE LEGAL ENTITY STATUS OF THE COMPANY COVENANTS AND CERTAIN  96  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER CUSTOMARY COVENANTS. OTHER EVENTS OF DEFAULT UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  AN INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO OF LESS THAN 150.0%;  \u2022  AN OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO OF LESS THAN 175.0%;  \u2022  THE FILING OF CERTAIN ERISA OR TAX LIENS;  \u2022  THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN \u201cMANAGER EVENTS\u201d SUCH AS.  \u2022  FAILURE BY SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND ITS AFFILIATES TO MAINTAIN COLLECTIVELY, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, A  CASH EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO AT LEAST $5.0 MILLION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE;  \u2022  FAILURE OF THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND THE COMPANY TO BE IN FULL FORCE AND  EFFECT;  \u2022  INDICTMENT OR CONVICTION OF SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS OR ANY \u201cKEY PERSON\u201d FOR A FELONY OFFENSE, OR  ANY FRAUD, EMBEZZLEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS BY SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS OR ANY \u201cKEY PERSON\u201d AND, IN THE CASE OF \u201cKEY PERSONS,\u201d WITHOUT A REPUTABLE, EXPERIENCED INDIVIDUAL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO MADISON CAPITAL  FUNDING APPOINTED TO REPLACE SUCH KEY PERSON WITHIN 30 DAYS;  \u2022  RESIGNATION, TERMINATION, DISABILITY OR DEATH OF A \u201cKEY PERSON\u201d OR FAILURE OF ANY \u201cKEY  PERSON\u201d TO PROVIDE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS\u2019 DAILY ACTIVITIES, ALL WITHOUT A REPUTABLE, EXPERIENCED INDIVIDUAL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING APPOINTED WITHIN 30 DAYS; OR  \u2022  OCCURRENCE OF ANY EVENT CONSTITUTING \u201cCAUSE\u201d UNDER THE COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE  COMPANY AND SARATOGA CLO (THE \u201cCLO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT\u201d), DELIVERY OF A NOTICE UNDER SECTION 12(C) OF THE CLO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE REMOVAL OF THE COMPANY AS COLLATERAL MANAGER OR THE COMPANY CEASES TO ACT AS  COLLATERAL MANAGER UNDER THE CLO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  CONDITIONS TO ACQUISITIONS AND PLEDGES OF LOAN ASSETS.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IMPOSES CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS TO THE ACQUISITION AND PLEDGE OF ADDITIONAL LOAN ASSETS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE COMPANY MAY NOT ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL LOAN ASSETS WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT INDICATES IN WRITING ITS SATISFACTION WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS\u2019 POLICIES, PERSONNEL AND PROCESSES RELATING TO THE LOAN ASSETS.  FEES AND EXPENSES.  THE COMPANY PAID CERTAIN FEES AND REIMBURSED MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC FOR THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ALL DOCUMENTED,  OUT-OF-POCKET  COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING THE REASONABLE FEES AND EXPENSES OF LAWYERS, INCURRED BY MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC IN CONNECTION WITH THE CREDIT FACILITY  AND THE CARRYING OUT OF ANY AND ALL ACTS CONTEMPLATED THEREUNDER UP TO AND AS OF THE DATE OF CLOSING OF THE STOCK PURCHASE TRANSACTION WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES. THESE AMOUNTS TOTALED $2.0 MILLION.  ON FEBRUARY 24, 2012, WE AMENDED OUR SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  EXPAND THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FROM $40.0 MILLION TO $45.0 MILLION;  \u2022  EXTEND THE PERIOD DURING WHICH WE MAY MAKE AND REPAY BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FROM JULY 30, 2013  TO FEBRUARY 24, 2015 (THE \u201cREVOLVING PERIOD\u201d). THE REVOLVING PERIOD MAY, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, BY ACTION OF THE LENDERS OR AUTOMATICALLY, BE TERMINATED. ALL BORROWINGS AND OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER THE CREDIT  FACILITY ARE DUE AND PAYABLE FIVE YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD; AND  97  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  REMOVE THE CONDITION THAT WE MAY NOT ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL LOAN ASSETS WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE  ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.  ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2014, WE ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDMENT TO THE REVOLVING FACILITY WITH  MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  EXTEND THE COMMITMENT TERMINATION DATE FROM FEBRUARY 24, 2015 TO SEPTEMBER 17, 2017;  \u2022  EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE OF THE REVOLVING FACILITY FROM FEBRUARY 24, 2020 TO SEPTEMBER 17, 2022 (UNLESS  TERMINATED SOONER UPON CERTAIN EVENTS);  \u2022  REDUCE THE APPLICABLE MARGIN RATE ON BASE RATE BORROWINGS FROM 4.50% TO 3.75%, AND ON LIBOR BORROWINGS FROM 5.50%  TO 4.75%; AND  \u2022  REDUCE THE FLOOR ON BASE RATE BORROWINGS FROM 3.00% TO 2.25%; AND ON LIBOR BORROWINGS FROM 2.00% TO 1.25%.  ON MAY 18, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A THIRD AMENDMENT TO THE CREDIT FACILITY WITH MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC TO,  AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  EXTEND THE COMMITMENT TERMINATION DATE FROM SEPTEMBER 17, 2017 TO SEPTEMBER 17, 2020;  \u2022  EXTEND THE FINAL MATURITY DATE OF THE CREDIT FACILITY FROM SEPTEMBER 17, 2022 TO SEPTEMBER 17, 2025;  \u2022  REDUCE THE FLOOR ON BASE RATE BORROWINGS FROM 2.25% TO 2.00%;  \u2022  REDUCE THE FLOOR ON LIBOR BORROWINGS FROM 1.25% TO 1.00%; AND  \u2022  REDUCE THE COMMITMENT FEE RATE FROM 0.75% TO 0.50% FOR ANY PERIOD DURING WHICH THE RATIO OF ADVANCES OUTSTANDING  TO AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS, EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE, IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 50%.  AS OF MAY 31, 2019, WE HAD  $0.0 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND $150.0 MILLION OF  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES OUTSTANDING (WHICH ARE DISCUSSED BELOW). AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE HAD NO  OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND $150.0 MILLION OF  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES OUTSTANDING. OUR BORROWING BASE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AT MAY 31, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS $27.3 MILLION AND $30.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  OUR ASSET COVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN THE 1940 ACT, WAS 238.9% AS OF  MAY 31, 2019 AND 234.5% AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES  IN ADDITION, WE, THROUGH A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, SOUGHT AND OBTAINED A LICENSE FROM THE SBA TO OPERATE AN SBIC. IN THIS REGARD, ON  MARCH 28, 2012, OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, SARATOGA INVESTMENT CORP. SBIC, LP, RECEIVED A LICENSE FROM THE SBA TO OPERATE AS AN SBIC UNDER SECTION 301(C) OF THE SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT ACT OF 1958. SBICS ARE DESIGNATED TO STIMULATE THE  FLOW OF PRIVATE EQUITY CAPITAL TO ELIGIBLE SMALL BUSINESSES. UNDER SBA REGULATIONS, SBICS MAY MAKE LOANS TO ELIGIBLE SMALL BUSINESSES AND INVEST IN THE EQUITY SECURITIES OF SMALL BUSINESSES.  THE SBIC LICENSE ALLOWS OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY TO OBTAIN LEVERAGE BY ISSUING  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES.  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES ARE  NON-RECOURSE,  INTEREST ONLY DEBENTURES WITH INTEREST PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY AND HAVE A  TEN-YEAR  MATURITY.  THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE PAID PRIOR TO MATURITY  BUT MAY BE PREPAID AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PENALTY. THE INTEREST RATE OF  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES IS FIXED ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS AT A MARKET-DRIVEN SPREAD OVER U.S. TREASURY NOTES WITH  TEN-YEAR  MATURITIES.  98  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SBA REGULATIONS CURRENTLY LIMIT THE AMOUNT THAT OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY MAY BORROW TO A MAXIMUM  OF $150.0 MILLION WHEN IT HAS AT LEAST $75.0 MILLION IN REGULATORY CAPITAL, RECEIVES A CAPITAL COMMITMENT FROM THE SBA AND HAS BEEN THROUGH AN EXAMINATION BY THE SBA SUBSEQUENT TO LICENSING. AS OF MAY 31, 2019, OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY HAD  $75.0 MILLION IN REGULATORY CAPITAL AND $150.0 MILLION  SBA-  GUARANTEED DEBENTURES OUTSTANDING.  WE RECEIVED EXEMPTIVE RELIEF FROM THE SEC TO PERMIT US TO EXCLUDE THE DEBT OF OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEED BY THE SBA FROM THE DEFINITION OF  SENIOR SECURITIES IN THE ASSET COVERAGE TEST UNDER THE 1940 ACT. THIS ALLOWS US INCREASED FLEXIBILITY UNDER THE ASSET COVERAGE TEST BY PERMITTING US TO BORROW UP TO $150.0 MILLION MORE THAN WE WOULD OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO ABSENT THE RECEIPT OF  THIS EXEMPTIVE RELIEF. ON APRIL 16, 2018, AS PERMITTED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT AVAILABILITY ACT, WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON MARCH 23, 2018, OUR  NON-  INTERESTED BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED OF  OUR BECOMING SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM ASSET COVERAGE RATIO OF 150.0% FROM 200% UNDER SECTIONS 18(A)(1) AND 18(A)(2) OF THE 1940 ACT.

THE DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES.  THE DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS APPROXIMATELY  6.6%  AS COMPARED TO A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  0.6%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN STORES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE TRANSACTION AMOUNT.  THE COMPANY'S COMPARABLE SALES METRIC CONSIDERS SALES CONSUMMATED THROUGH ALL RETAIL CHANNELS - IN-STORE, ONLINE, WITH A MOBILE DEVICE OR THROUGH A CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER. CUSTOMERS TODAY MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE COMPANY'S OMNICHANNEL ENVIRONMENT BY USING MORE THAN ONE CHANNEL WHEN MAKING A PURCHASE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IN AN INTEGRATED AND SEAMLESS CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. A FEW EXAMPLES ARE: A CUSTOMER MAY BE ASSISTED BY AN IN-STORE ASSOCIATE TO CREATE A WEDDING OR BABY REGISTRY, WHILE THE GUESTS MAY ULTIMATELY PURCHASE A GIFT FROM THE COMPANY'S WEBSITES; OR A CUSTOMER MAY RESEARCH A PARTICULAR ITEM, AND READ OTHER CUSTOMER REVIEWS ON THE COMPANY'S WEBSITES BEFORE VISITING A STORE TO CONSUMMATE THE ACTUAL PURCHASE; OR A CUSTOMER MAY RESERVE AN ITEM ONLINE FOR IN-STORE PICK UP; OR WHILE IN A STORE, A CUSTOMER MAY MAKE THE PURCHASE ON A MOBILE DEVICE FOR IN HOME DELIVERY FROM EITHER A DISTRIBUTION FACILITY, A STORE OR DIRECTLY FROM A VENDOR. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ACCEPTS RETURNS IN-STORE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CHANNEL IN WHICH THE PURCHASE WAS CONSUMMATED, THEREFORE RESULTING IN REDUCING STORE SALES BY SALES ORIGINALLY CONSUMMATED THROUGH CUSTOMER FACING DIGITAL CHANNELS. AS THE COMPANY'S RETAIL OPERATIONS ARE INTEGRATED AND IT CANNOT REASONABLY TRACK THE CHANNEL IN WHICH THE ULTIMATE SALE IS INITIATED, THE COMPANY CAN, HOWEVER, PROVIDE DIRECTIONAL INFORMATION ON WHERE THE SALE WAS CONSUMMATED.  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  , COMPARABLE SALES CONSUMMATED IN-STORE DECLINED IN THE HIGH-SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE RANGE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES CONSUMMATED THROUGH CUSTOMER FACING DIGITAL CHANNELS.  -21-  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  , COMPARABLE SALES REPRESENTED  $2.489 BILLION  OF NET SALES.  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  , COMPARABLE SALES REPRESENTED  $2.667 BILLION  OF NET SALES, RESPECTIVELY.  DOMESTICS MERCHANDISE INCLUDES CATEGORIES SUCH AS BED LINENS AND RELATED ITEMS, BATH ITEMS AND KITCHEN TEXTILES.

GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  $887.2 MILLION  , OR  34.5%  OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH  $964.8 MILLION  , OR  35.0%  OF NET SALES, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  . IN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE, THE DECREASE IN THE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO A DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN COUPON EXPENSE AND NET DIRECT-TO-CUSTOMER SHIPPING EXPENSE. THE DECREASE IN COUPON EXPENSE WAS THE RESULT OF A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF REDEMPTIONS WITH FEWER PIECES DISTRIBUTED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COUPON AMOUNT.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS INVESTING IN THE LIFETIME VALUE OF ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS ANNUAL BEYOND PLUS MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM.  THE RICHER BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM, INCLUDING TWENTY PERCENT OFF ENTIRE PURCHASE AND FREE SHIPPING, ARE REALIZED IMMEDIATELY UPON SALE AND HAD, AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE, AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S GROSS MARGIN DURING THE PERIOD OF INCREASING ENROLLMENT.  THE BEYOND PLUS MEMBERSHIP FEE IS AMORTIZED OVER THE ONE-YEAR MEMBERSHIP PERIOD.  THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THAT THE IMPACT OF THESE PROGRAMS REDUCED GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES BY APPROXIMATELY 60 BASIS POINTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND APPROXIMATELY 40 BASIS POINTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SG&A FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  $892.8 MILLION  , OR  34.7%  OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH  $883.6 MILLION  , OR  32.1%  OF NET SALES, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  .

GOODWILL AND OTHER IMPAIRMENTS  GOODWILL AND OTHER IMPAIRMENTS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  $401.3 MILLION  , OR  15.6%  OF NET SALES.  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS WERE $391.1 MILLION AND TRADENAME IMPAIRMENTS WERE $10.2 MILLION.  THE NON-CASH PRE-TAX GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A SUSTAINED DECLINE IN THE COMPANY'S MARKET CAPITALIZATION.  THERE WERE NO GOODWILL OR OTHER IMPAIRMENTS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018.  OPERATING (LOSS) PROFIT  OPERATING LOSS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  $406.8 MILLION  , OR  15.8%  OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH OPERATING PROFIT OF  $81.2 MILLION  , OR  2.9%  OF NET SALES, DURING THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE CHANGES IN OPERATING PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WERE THE RESULT OF THE REDUCTIONS IN GROSS PROFIT MARGIN AND THE INCREASES IN SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES AND GOODWILL AND OTHER IMPAIRMENTS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  $15.9 MILLION  , COMPARED WITH  $16.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  .  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  AND  JUNE 2, 2018  , INTEREST EXPENSE, NET PRIMARILY RELATED TO INTEREST ON THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY IN JULY 2014.  INCOME TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  12.2%  , COMPARED WITH  32.4%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  . FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF CHARGES FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER IMPAIRMENTS AND SEVERANCE COSTS, PORTIONS OF WHICH ARE NON-DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE TAX RATES ALSO INCLUDED OTHER DISCRETE TAX ITEMS RESULTING IN NET AFTER TAX COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $12.5  MILLION AND  $3.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  AND  JUNE 2, 2018  , DUE TO DISCRETE FEDERAL AND STATE TAX ITEMS OCCURRING DURING THESE QUARTERS.  -22-  POTENTIAL VOLATILITY IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM YEAR TO YEAR MAY OCCUR AS THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED EACH YEAR TO DETERMINE WHETHER NEW INFORMATION CHANGES THE ASSESSMENT OF BOTH THE PROBABILITY THAT A TAX POSITION WILL EFFECTIVELY BE SUSTAINED AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE AMOUNT OF RECOGNIZED BENEFIT.  NET (LOSS) EARNINGS  AS A RESULT OF THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, NET LOSS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WERE  $371.1 MILLION  , COMPARED WITH NET EARNINGS OF  $43.6 MILLION  FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018.  GROWTH  THE COMPANY HAS UNDERTAKEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO ADAPT TO THE DYNAMIC RETAIL ENVIRONMENT AND THE EVOLVING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS TO IMPROVE ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION AND HAS BEEN EXECUTING ON A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO TRANSFORM ITS BUSINESS AND POSITION THE COMPANY FOR LONG-TERM SUCCESS.  DURING THIS INTERIM PERIOD AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE BOARD AND MANAGEMENT TEAM ARE TAKING A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO THE COMPANY'S ON-GOING BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND HAVE IDENTIFIED FOUR KEY NEAR-TERM PRIORITIES THAT INCLUDE: 1) STABILIZING AND DRIVING TOP-LINE GROWTH; 2) RESETTING THE COST STRUCTURE; 3) REVIEWING AND OPTIMIZING THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSET BASE, INCLUDING ITS PORTFOLIO OF RETAIL BANNERS; AND 4) REFINING THE COMPANY\u2019S ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE.  THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO EXECUTE ITS TRANSFORMATION STRATEGY SUCCESSFULLY.

THE RISK-NEUTRAL METHOD  IS APPLIED, RESULTING IN A VALUE THAT CAPTURES THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORM OF THE PAYOUT STRUCTURE AND THE PROJECTION RISK. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY AND ACTUAL AMOUNTS PAID MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT  FROM THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE LIABILITY.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPAIRMENT OF PUBLIC INVENTORY.  THE IMPAIRMENT OF PUBLIC INVENTORY FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019 WAS $2,332,763 COMPARED TO $0 FOR THE 2018 PERIOD. DUE TO CHANGES IN SALES TRENDS AND ESTIMATED RECOVERABILITY OF COST CAPITALIZED INTO INVENTORY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $2,332,763 WAS RECOGNIZED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019 TO REDUCE INVENTORY FROM COST TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE.  INTEREST EXPENSE.  INTEREST EXPENSE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019, WAS $424,287 COMPARED TO $304,094 DURING THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN 2018, OF WHICH, $209,546 AND $119,655, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THE CREDIT AND SUBORDINATION AGREEMENTS WITH TEXAS CAPITAL BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AS DESCRIBED  IN NOTE 6. THE REMAINING INTEREST EXPENSE IS MAINLY COMPRISED OF AMOUNTS DUE TO THE PARTIES TO THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENTS (\u201cRSAS\u201d) BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S STORAGE REVENUE COLLECTED.  INCOME TAXES.  U.S. INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WAS $29,115 COMPARED TO $293,949 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2018.  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED TAX RATES EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED. THE  ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS DEPENDS UPON GENERATING SUFFICIENT FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE TAX ATTRIBUTES. IN ASSESSING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WE MUST PROJECT FUTURE LEVELS OF TAXABLE INCOME.  THIS ASSESSMENT REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. WE EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE RELATED TO THE RECENT HISTORY OF TAX LOSSES, THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND OUR FORECASTS AND PROJECTIONS TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION.  THE COMPANY RECORDS FOREIGN INCOME TAXES WITHHELD FROM INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS OF  NON-REFUNDABLE  UP-FRONT  LICENSE FEES AND ROYALTY INCOME EARNED ON THE PROCESSING AND STORAGE OF CORD BLOOD STEM CELL SPECIMENS IN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS LICENSE AGREEMENTS.

THE ADDITIONAL PROCEEDS OF THE TERM LOAN WERE USED BY THE COMPANY TO FUND THE EXTINGUISHMENT OF REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENTS.  ON JUNE 11, 2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH TCB. PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT  TO CREDIT AGREEMENT, TCB MADE AN ADDITIONAL ADVANCE TO THE COMPANY IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $9,000,000 PER AN AMENDED AND RESTATED PROMISSORY NOTE DATED JUNE 11, 2018 BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND TCB IN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $15,500,000.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A LINE OF CREDIT.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES MAKING DISCRETIONARY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY $500,000 OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS FOR SOFTWARE  ENHANCEMENTS AND PURCHASES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES FUNDING FUTURE PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES WITH  CASH-ON-HAND  AND CASH FLOWS FROM  FUTURE OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ITS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND CASH FLOWS FROM FUTURE  OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND ITS KNOWN CASH NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS WILL DEPEND PRIMARILY UPON INCREASING REVENUES FROM SALES OF ITS UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD AND CORD TISSUE CELLULAR STORAGE SERVICES  AND MANAGING DISCRETIONARY EXPENSES. IF EXPECTED INCREASES IN REVENUES ARE NOT REALIZED, OR IF EXPENSES ARE HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO REDUCE OR DEFER CASH EXPENDITURES OR OTHERWISE MANAGE ITS CASH RESOURCES DURING THE  NEXT 12 MONTHS SO THAT THEY ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH NEEDS FOR THAT PERIOD. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER SEEKING EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING IF DEEMED APPROPRIATE FOR ITS PLAN OF OPERATIONS, AND IF SUCH FINANCING CAN BE  OBTAINED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.

THE 2019 AND 2018 TWO FISCAL QUARTERS REFERENCED HEREIN REPRESENT THE TWENTY-FOUR-WEEK PERIODS ENDED JUNE 16, 2019 AND JUNE 17, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  OVERVIEW  DOMINO\u2019S IS THE LARGEST PIZZA COMPANY IN THE WORLD BASED ON GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WITH MORE THAN 16,300 LOCATIONS IN OVER 85 MARKETS. FOUNDED IN 1960, OUR ROOTS ARE IN CONVENIENT PIZZA DELIVERY, WHILE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SALES ALSO COME FROM CARRYOUT CUSTOMERS. DOMINO\u2019S GENERATES REVENUES AND EARNINGS BY CHARGING ROYALTIES AND FEES TO OUR INDEPENDENT FRANCHISEES. THE COMPANY ALSO GENERATES REVENUES AND EARNINGS BY SELLING FOOD, EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO FRANCHISEES PRIMARILY IN THE U.S. AND CANADA, AND BY OPERATING A NUMBER OF OUR OWN STORES IN THE U.S. FRANCHISEES PROFIT BY SELLING PIZZA AND OTHER COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS TO THEIR LOCAL CUSTOMERS. IN OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE GENERALLY GRANT GEOGRAPHICAL RIGHTS TO THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA  \u00ae  BRAND TO MASTER FRANCHISEES. THESE MASTER FRANCHISEES ARE CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL AREA, AND THEY CAN PROFIT BY  SUB-FRANCHISING  AND SELLING INGREDIENTS AND EQUIPMENT TO THOSE  SUB-FRANCHISEES,  AS WELL AS BY RUNNING PIZZA STORES DIRECTLY. EVERYONE IN THE SYSTEM CAN BENEFIT, INCLUDING THE END CONSUMER, WHO CAN FEED THEIR FAMILY DOMINO\u2019S MENU ITEMS CONVENIENTLY AND ECONOMICALLY.  OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE DRIVEN LARGELY BY RETAIL SALES AT OUR FRANCHISE AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES. CHANGES IN RETAIL SALES ARE DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN SAME STORE SALES AND STORE COUNTS. WE MONITOR BOTH OF THESE METRICS VERY CLOSELY, AS THEY DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS, AND WE STRIVE TO CONSISTENTLY INCREASE BOTH METRICS. RETAIL SALES DRIVE ROYALTY PAYMENTS FROM FRANCHISEES, AS WELL AS COMPANY-OWNED STORE AND SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES. RETAIL SALES ARE PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA  \u00ae  BRAND, THE RESULTS OF OUR EXTENSIVE ADVERTISING THROUGH VARIOUS MEDIA CHANNELS, THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND DIGITAL ORDERING, OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR STRONG AND PROVEN BUSINESS MODEL AND THE OVERALL GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

THE SAME STORE SALES GROWTH FOR THESE STORES IS REFLECTED IN U.S. FRANCHISE STORES IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WE EXPERIENCED GLOBAL RETAIL SALES GROWTH. OUR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH REMAINED POSITIVE BUT WAS PRESSURED BY OUR CURRENT STRATEGY TO INCREASE STORE CONCENTRATION IN CERTAIN MARKETS WHERE WE COMPETE.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ALSO CONTINUED OUR GLOBAL EXPANSION WITH THE OPENING OF 200 NET NEW STORES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, BRINGING OUR  YEAR-TO-DATE  TOTAL TO 400. WE OPENED 158 NET NEW STORES INTERNATIONALLY AND 42 NET NEW STORES IN THE U.S. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. OVERALL, WE BELIEVE THIS GLOBAL STORE GROWTH, ALONG WITH OUR STRONG SALES, EMPHASIS ON TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONS, AND MARKETING INITIATIVES, HAVE COMBINED TO STRENGTHEN OUR BRAND.  GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WHICH ARE TOTAL WORLDWIDE RETAIL SALES AT FRANCHISE AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES, INCREASED 5.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 4.8% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN WORLDWIDE STORE COUNTS DURING THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS AS WELL AS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES PARTIALLY OFFSET THIS INCREASE, RESULTING FROM A GENERALLY STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR WHEN COMPARED TO THE CURRENCIES IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. U.S. SAME STORE SALES GROWTH REFLECTED THE SUSTAINED POSITIVE SALES TRENDS AND THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS, MARKETING AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH ALSO REFLECTED CONTINUED POSITIVE PERFORMANCE.  TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED $32.2 MILLION, OR 4.1%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $82.8 MILLION, OR 5.3%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN AND GLOBAL FRANCHISE REVENUES. THE INCREASES IN INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE ALSO PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORE REVENUES RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF 59 COMPANY-OWNED STORES TO CERTAIN OF OUR EXISTING U.S. FRANCHISEES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 (THE \u201cSECOND QUARTER STORE SALE\u201d). THESE CHANGES IN REVENUES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $12.8 MILLION, OR 10.1%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $22.8 MILLION, OR 8.8%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER ROYALTY REVENUES FROM U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISED STORES, AS WELL AS HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN MARGINS. HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND OTHER AREAS AND A $2.4 MILLION  PRE-TAX  LOSS RELATED TO THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE INCREASES. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  NET INCOME INCREASED $15.0 MILLION, OR 19.3%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $18.8 MILLION, OR 11.3%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, DRIVEN BY HIGHER INCOME FROM OPERATIONS AND LOWER TAX EXPENSE RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM HIGHER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION. NET INCOME FURTHER BENEFITED FROM LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 RESULTING FROM $3.3 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL INTEREST EXPENSE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH OUR RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTION COMPLETED ON APRIL 24, 2018 (THE \u201c2018 RECAPITALIZATION\u201d). THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM A HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE AND A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE FOLLOWING THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION.

THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER VOLUMES FROM INCREASED ORDERS RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF U.S. FRANCHISE STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD AND AN INCREASE IN MARKET BASKET PRICING. OUR MARKET BASKET PRICING TO STORES INCREASED 2.3% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.0% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WHICH RESULTED IN AN ESTIMATED INCREASE IN U.S. SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES OF $5.6 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND $11.8 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN  REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS INCREASED $1.8 MILLION, OR 4.4%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $4.0 MILLION, OR 4.9%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER VOLUMES FROM INCREASED ORDERS AND AN INCREASE IN MARKET BASKET PRICING. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OF $1.7 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND $3.8 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEE REVENUES  REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEES INCREASED $3.7 MILLION, OR 7.1%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $5.8 MILLION, OR 5.6%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD AND HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OF $3.0 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND $6.6 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 2.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.1% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 4.0% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND INCREASED 4.4% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COST OF SALES / OPERATING MARGIN  SECOND QUARTER  SECOND QUARTER  TWO FISCAL  TWO FISCAL  OF 2019  OF 2018  QUARTERS OF 2019  QUARTERS OF 2018  CONSOLIDATED REVENUES  $811.6  100.0%  $779.4  100.0%  $1,647.6  100.0%  $1,564.8  100.0%  CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES  495.0  61.0%  485.8  62.3%  1,008.7  61.2%  971.3  62.1%  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN  $316.7  39.0%  $293.6  37.7%  $639.0  38.8%  $593.4  37.9%  COST OF SALES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF COMPANY-OWNED STORE AND SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS INCURRED TO GENERATE RELATED REVENUES. COMPONENTS OF CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES PRIMARILY INCLUDE FOOD, LABOR, DELIVERY AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN (WHICH WE DEFINE AS REVENUES LESS COST OF SALES) INCREASED $23.1 MILLION, OR 7.9%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $45.6 MILLION, OR 7.7%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GLOBAL FRANCHISE REVENUES AND HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN VOLUMES. FRANCHISE REVENUES DO NOT HAVE A COST OF SALES COMPONENT, SO CHANGES IN THESE REVENUES HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE OPERATING MARGIN.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES, THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 1.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. COMPANY-OWNED STORE OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

OPERATING MARGIN IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY HIGHER LABOR COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. AS A PERCENTAGE OF STORE REVENUES, THE STORE OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE CHANGES IN OPERATING MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  \u2022  FOOD COSTS DECREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 26.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND DECREASED 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 27.0% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE LEVERAGING OF HIGHER SAME STORE SALES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN EFFICIENCY. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FOOD PRICES.  \u2022  LABOR COSTS DECREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 29.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 30.2% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCTION IN LABOR COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF STORE REVENUES IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE TO THE HIGH LABOR RATES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE SOLD STORES OPERATED. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND FULLY OFFSET IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE LABOR RATES IN OUR REMAINING COMPANY-OWNED STORE MARKETS.

AS A PERCENTAGE OF SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES, THE SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO PROCUREMENT SAVINGS AND LOWER INSURANCE EXPENSE, OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER LABOR COSTS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED $2.7 MILLION, OR 3.2%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $8.2 MILLION, OR 4.8%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND OTHER AREAS. A $2.4 MILLION  PRE-TAX  LOSS RELATED TO THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASES.  U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING EXPENSES  U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING EXPENSES INCREASED $7.6 MILLION, OR 9.4%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $14.5 MILLION, OR 8.9%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE TO HIGHER U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING REVENUES. U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING COSTS ARE ACCRUED AND EXPENSED WHEN THE RELATED U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED, AS OUR CONSOLIDATED  NOT-FOR-PROFIT  ADVERTISING FUND IS OBLIGATED TO EXPEND SUCH REVENUES ON ADVERTISING AND THESE REVENUES CANNOT BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET DECREASED $2.0 MILLION, OR 5.7%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $2.5 MILLION, OR 3.9%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE, NET IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 RESULTED FROM $3.3 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL INTEREST EXPENSE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND MORE THAN OFFSET IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 BY A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER AVERAGE BORROWINGS RESULTING FROM THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION AND OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES. A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  THE COMPANY\u2019S WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE INCREASED TO 4.1% IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, FROM 4.0% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND 3.9% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018, RESULTING FROM THE HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON THE DEBT OUTSTANDING IN 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES DECREASED $0.2 MILLION, OR 1.2%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $1.5 MILLION, OR 5.2%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. HIGHER  PRE-TAX  INCOME CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER TAX EXPENSE IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, BUT THESE INCREASES WERE FULLY OFFSET IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND PARTIALLY OFFSET IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 BY HIGHER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED TO 12.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND DECREASED TO 14.0% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 15.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND 14.7% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE OPERATED WITH MINIMAL POSITIVE WORKING CAPITAL OR NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OUR RECEIVABLE COLLECTION PERIODS AND INVENTORY TURN RATES ARE FASTER THAN THE NORMAL PAYMENT TERMS ON OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES. WE GENERALLY COLLECT OUR RECEIVABLES WITHIN THREE WEEKS FROM THE DATE OF THE RELATED SALE, AND WE GENERALLY EXPERIENCE 35 TO 45 INVENTORY TURNS PER YEAR. IN ADDITION, OUR SALES ARE NOT TYPICALLY SEASONAL, WHICH FURTHER LIMITS OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE USE OF OUR ONGOING CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO SERVICE OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK REDUCES OUR WORKING CAPITAL AMOUNTS. AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL OF $73.5 MILLION, EXCLUDING RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $152.7 MILLION, ADVERTISING FUND ASSETS, RESTRICTED, OF $117.7 MILLION AND ADVERTISING FUND LIABILITIES OF $113.4 MILLION. WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDES TOTAL UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $108.3 MILLION.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, OUR INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. BUSINESSES GREW STORE COUNTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE OUR UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, EXCESS CASH FROM OUR RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTIONS AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INVEST IN OUR CORE BUSINESS, SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL COMMITMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS OF JUNE 16, 2019.  BASED UPON OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF OPERATIONS AND ANTICIPATED GROWTH, WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, OUR CURRENT UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTE FACILITY WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO FUND THESE ITEMS AND CONTINUE TO REDUCE DEBT COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE EVENTS DESCRIBED UNDER \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OR THAT FUTURE BORROWINGS WILL BE AVAILABLE UNDER THE VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES OR OTHERWISE TO ENABLE US TO SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS OR TO MAKE ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OUR FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE, EXTEND OR REFINANCE OUR FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES AND TO SERVICE, EXTEND OR REFINANCE OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES WILL BE SUBJECT TO FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TO FINANCIAL, BUSINESS AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESTRICTED CASH  AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $115.9 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH HELD FOR FUTURE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS AND OTHER WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF OUR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATION STRUCTURE, $36.6 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH HELD IN A THREE-MONTH INTEREST RESERVE AS REQUIRED BY THE RELATED DEBT AGREEMENTS AND $0.2 MILLION OF OTHER RESTRICTED CASH FOR A TOTAL OF $152.7 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE ALSO HELD $61.3 MILLION OF ADVERTISING FUND RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, WHICH CAN ONLY BE USED FOR ACTIVITIES THAT PROMOTE THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA BRAND.  LONG-TERM DEBT  AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $3.45 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, OF WHICH $35.9 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY. OUR FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES FROM THE RECAPITALIZATIONS WE COMPLETED IN 2018, 2017 AND 2015 HAVE ORIGINAL SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF $17.6 MILLION IN THE REMAINDER OF 2019, $35.3 MILLION IN EACH OF 2020 AND 2021, $888.0 MILLION IN 2022, $26.3 MILLION IN EACH OF 2023 AND 2024, $1.14 BILLION IN 2025, $14.0 MILLION IN 2026 AND $1.27 BILLION IN 2027. AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND $126.9 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING, NET OF LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED OF $48.1 MILLION. THE LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR CASUALTY INSURANCE PROGRAMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN CENTER LEASES. BORROWINGS UNDER THE VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES ARE AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND, SUBJECT TO OTHER LIMITATIONS, OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS  OUR OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN FUNDED BY EXCESS CASH FLOWS. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO $750.0 MILLION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 12,295 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $3.3 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $269.14 PER SHARE. DURING THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 45,844 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $11.5 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $249.82 PER SHARE. AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD A TOTAL REMAINING AUTHORIZED AMOUNT FOR SHARE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY $147.3 MILLION.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 905,556 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $219.0 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $241.82 PER SHARE. DURING THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 1,353,564 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $320.1 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $236.46 PER SHARE.  DIVIDENDS  ON MARCH 29, 2019, THE COMPANY PAID A $0.65 DIVIDEND TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF MARCH 15, 2019. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, ON APRIL 23, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A $0.65 PER SHARE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON ITS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF JUNE 14, 2019, WHICH WAS PAID ON JUNE 28, 2019.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE SECOND QUARTER, ON JULY 10, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A $0.65 PER SHARE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON ITS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF SEPTEMBER 13, 2019 TO BE PAID ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.

THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DURING 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 AND WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN ADVERTISING FUND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, RESTRICTED IN 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $2.5 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WHICH CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF $25.7 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND SUPPLY CHAIN CENTERS). THIS USE OF CASH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MATURITIES OF ADVERTISING FUND INVESTMENTS, RESTRICTED OF $15.2 MILLION AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS OF $8.2 MILLION, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $43.8 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018, WHICH CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF $37.3 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES, SUPPLY CHAIN CENTERS AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES) AND PURCHASES OF RESTRICTED ADVERTISING FUND INVESTMENTS OF $35.2 MILLION. THESE USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MATURITIES OF RESTRICTED ADVERTISING FUND INVESTMENTS OF $29.0 MILLION.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $114.3 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, PRIMARILY RELATED TO REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $82.9 MILLION (OF WHICH $65.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES), DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS OF $26.7 MILLION, PURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK OF $11.5 MILLION UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND TAX PAYMENTS FOR RESTRICTED STOCK UPON VESTING OF $2.6 MILLION. THESE USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS OF $9.3 MILLION.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $30.1 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018. WE ISSUED $825.0 MILLION OF DEBT IN CONNECTION WITH OUR 2018 RECAPITALIZATION AND BORROWED $80.0 MILLION UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES. HOWEVER, THESE INCREASES IN CASH WERE OFFSET BY REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $586.1 MILLION (OF WHICH $490.0 MILLION WAS AN OPTIONAL PREPAYMENT ON OUR 2015 FIVE-YEAR FIXED RATE NOTES USING A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION AND $80.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE REPAYMENT OF THE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES), PURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK OF $320.1 MILLION, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS OF $23.5 MILLION, AND CASH PAID FOR FINANCING COSTS RELATED TO OUR 2018 RECAPITALIZATION OF $8.2 MILLION. WE ALSO MADE $2.3 MILLION IN TAX PAYMENTS FOR RESTRICTED STOCK UPON VESTING AND RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $5.2 MILLION FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  THIS FILING CONTAINS VARIOUS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ABOUT THE COMPANY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 (THE \u201cACT\u201d) THAT ARE BASED ON CURRENT MANAGEMENT EXPECTATIONS THAT INVOLVE SUBSTANTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS EXPRESSED IN, OR IMPLIED BY, THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

ALTHOUGH THE TAX ACT GENERALLY ELIMINATED U.S. FEDERAL TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS FROM FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH DIVIDENDS MAY STILL BE SUBJECT TO STATE INCOME TAXATION AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES. SNAP-ON PERIODICALLY EVALUATES ITS CASH HELD OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND MAY PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO REPATRIATE CERTAIN FOREIGN CASH AMOUNTS TO THE EXTENT THAT IT DOES NOT INCUR UNFAVORABLE NET TAX CONSEQUENCES.  52  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SNAP-ON INCORPORATED  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  TRADE AND OTHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE \u2013 NET OF $684.1 MILLION  AS OF  JUNE 29, 2019  , DECREASED $8.5  MILLION FROM  2018  YEAR-END LEVELS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED COLLECTIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  $1.9 MILLION  OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND  $0.7 MILLION  OF RECEIVABLES RELATED TO THE POWER HAWK ACQUISITION.

THE LONG-TERM PORTIONS OF NET FINANCE AND CONTRACT RECEIVABLES OF $1,436.5  MILLION AS OF  JUNE 29, 2019  , COMPARED TO $1,419.3  MILLION AT  2018  YEAR END. THE COMBINED $20.9  MILLION INCREASE IN NET CURRENT AND LONG-TERM FINANCE AND CONTRACT RECEIVABLES OVER  2018  YEAR-END LEVELS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL SERVICES PORTFOLIO AND  $2.8  MILLION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  INVENTORIES \u2013 NET OF $725.8 MILLION  AS OF  JUNE 29, 2019  , INCREASED $52.0  MILLION FROM  2018  YEAR-END LEVELS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR HIGHER CUSTOMER DEMAND AND NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AS WELL AS  $0.6 MILLION  OF INVENTORIES RELATED TO THE POWER HAWK ACQUISITION AND  $0.3 MILLION  OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  INVENTORY TURNS (TRAILING 12 MONTHS OF COST OF GOODS SOLD, DIVIDED BY THE AVERAGE OF THE BEGINNING AND ENDING INVENTORY BALANCE FOR THE TRAILING 12 MONTHS) WERE  2.7  TURNS AND  2.9  TURNS AS OF  JUNE 29, 2019  , AND  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

SNAP-ON HAS A FIVE-YEAR, $700  MILLION MULTI-CURRENCY REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT TERMINATES ON  DECEMBER 15, 2020  (THE \u201cCREDIT FACILITY\u201d); NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AS OF  JUNE 29, 2019  . BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT VARYING RATES BASED ON SNAP-ON\u2019S THEN-CURRENT, LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS. THE CREDIT FACILITY\u2019S FINANCIAL COVENANT REQUIRES THAT SNAP-ON MAINTAIN, AS OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER END, EITHER (I) A RATIO NOT GREATER THAN  0.60  TO 1.00 OF CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT (CONSOLIDATED DEBT NET OF CERTAIN CASH ADJUSTMENTS) TO THE SUM OF SUCH CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT PLUS TOTAL EQUITY AND LESS ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR LOSS (THE \u201cDEBT RATIO\u201d); OR (II) A RATIO NOT GREATER THAN  3.50  TO 1.00 OF SUCH CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT TO EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND CERTAIN OTHER ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE PRECEDING FOUR FISCAL QUARTERS THEN ENDED (THE \u201cDEBT TO EBITDA RATIO\u201d). SNAP-ON MAY, UP TO TWO TIMES DURING ANY FIVE-YEAR PERIOD DURING THE TERM OF THE CREDIT FACILITY (INCLUDING ANY EXTENSIONS THEREOF), INCREASE THE MAXIMUM DEBT RATIO TO  0.65  TO 1.00 AND/OR INCREASE THE MAXIMUM DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO TO  3.75  TO 1.00 FOR FOUR CONSECUTIVE FISCAL QUARTERS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN MATERIAL ACQUISITIONS (AS DEFINED IN THE RELATED CREDIT AGREEMENT). AS OF  JUNE 29, 2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S ACTUAL RATIOS OF  0.21  AND  0.95  , RESPECTIVELY, WERE BOTH WITHIN THE PERMITTED RANGES SET FORTH IN THIS FINANCIAL COVENANT. SNAP-ON GENERALLY ISSUES COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND ITS FINANCING NEEDS ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS AND USES THE CREDIT FACILITY AS BACK-UP LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT SUCH COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES.  SNAP-ON\u2019S CREDIT FACILITY AND OTHER DEBT AGREEMENTS ALSO CONTAIN CERTAIN USUAL AND CUSTOMARY BORROWING, AFFIRMATIVE, NEGATIVE AND MAINTENANCE COVENANTS. AS OF  JUNE 29, 2019  , SNAP-ON WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS OF ITS CREDIT FACILITY AND OTHER DEBT AGREEMENTS.  53  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SNAP-ON INCORPORATED  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  SNAP-ON BELIEVES IT HAS SUFFICIENT AVAILABLE CASH AND ACCESS TO BOTH COMMITTED AND UNCOMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES TO COVER ITS EXPECTED FUNDING NEEDS ON BOTH A SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BASIS. SNAP-ON MANAGES ITS AGGREGATE SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS SO AS NOT TO EXCEED ITS AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. SNAP-ON BELIEVES THAT IT CAN ACCESS SHORT-TERM DEBT MARKETS, PREDOMINANTLY THROUGH COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES AND EXISTING LINES OF CREDIT, TO FUND ITS SHORT-TERM REQUIREMENTS AND TO ENSURE NEAR-TERM LIQUIDITY. SNAP-ON REGULARLY MONITORS THE CREDIT AND FINANCIAL MARKETS AND MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT IT BELIEVES ARE FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS TO ISSUE LONG-TERM DEBT TO FURTHER IMPROVE ITS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. NEAR-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR SNAP-ON INCLUDE SCHEDULED DEBT PAYMENTS, PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS, FUNDING TO SUPPORT NEW RECEIVABLES ORIGINATED BY OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL, THE FUNDING OF PENSION PLANS, AND FUNDING FOR SHARE REPURCHASES AND ACQUISITIONS, IF AND AS THEY ARISE. SNAP-ON INTENDS TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS OF $9.4  MILLION TO ITS FOREIGN PENSION PLANS AND $2.0  MILLION TO ITS DOMESTIC PENSION PLANS IN  2019  , AS REQUIRED BY LAW. IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  , SNAP-ON MADE $25.0  MILLION OF DISCRETIONARY CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS DOMESTIC PENSION PLANS; DEPENDING ON MARKET AND OTHER CONDITIONS, SNAP\u2010ON MAY MAKE ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLANS IN THE BALANCE OF  2019.  SNAP-ON\u2019S LONG-TERM FINANCING STRATEGY IS TO MAINTAIN CONTINUOUS ACCESS TO THE DEBT MARKETS TO ACCOMMODATE ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL USE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, ADDITIONAL FIXED-TERM DEBT AND/OR SECURITIZATIONS.

THE 2019 SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM REPLACED THE COMPANY\u2019S 2017 SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, UNDER WHICH $206 MILLION OF AUTHORIZATION REMAINED AT THE TIME OF ITS REPLACEMENT. IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  2018  , SNAP-ON REPURCHASED  646,000  SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR $98.7  MILLION UNDER ITS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. AS OF  JUNE 29, 2019  , SNAP-ON HAD REMAINING AVAILABILITY TO REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $445.3 MILLION  IN COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO ITS BOARD\u2019S AUTHORIZATIONS.  54  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SNAP-ON INCORPORATED  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  THE PURCHASE OF SNAP-ON COMMON STOCK IS AT THE COMPANY\u2019S DISCRETION, SUBJECT TO PREVAILING FINANCIAL AND MARKET CONDITIONS. SNAP-ON BELIEVES THAT ITS CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABLE CASH ON HAND, AND FUNDS AVAILABLE FROM ITS CREDIT FACILITIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMPANY\u2019S ADDITIONAL SHARE REPURCHASES, IF ANY, IN THE BALANCE OF  2019.  SNAP-ON HAS PAID CONSECUTIVE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS, WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR REDUCTION, SINCE 1939. CASH DIVIDENDS TOTALED $105.3  MILLION AND $92.8  MILLION IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. ON NOVEMBER 8, 2018, THE BOARD INCREASED THE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND BY  15.9%  TO $0.95  PER SHARE ($3.80  PER SHARE ANNUALIZED). SNAP-ON BELIEVES THAT ITS CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABLE CASH ON HAND, AND FUNDS AVAILABLE FROM ITS CREDIT FACILITIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN THE BALANCE OF  2019.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS OF  JUNE 29, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  SNAP-ON\u2019S DISCLOSURES OF ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE CONTAINED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , HAVE NOT MATERIALLY CHANGED SINCE THAT REPORT WAS FILED.

IN PURSUIT OF THESE INITIATIVES, SNAP-ON EXPECTS THAT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN  2019  WILL BE IN A RANGE OF $90  MILLION TO $100  MILLION, OF WHICH $48.2  MILLION WAS EXPENDED IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF THE YEAR. SNAP-ON ALSO ANTICIPATES THAT ITS FULL YEAR  2019  EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WILL BE COMPARABLE TO ITS FULL YEAR  2018  RATE OF  24.0%.  55  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "SNAP-ON Inc", "CIK": 91440, "Date": "2019-07-18T00:00:00", "Ticker": "SNA", "Name": "Snap-on Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 3420.0, "Business": "WI", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 390622040.0, "key": "20190718SNA", "labelr1": -0.8788739840084665, "labelr2": 0.533333333333341, "labelr3": 2.679045092838191, "labelr4": -0.051666236114707116, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5507092, "prof1": 0.44929084, "return1&2": 1.003408533227604, "return1&2&3": 0.9765267661570504, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9770313007817764, "return2": 0.9946666666666666, "return1": 1.0087887398400848, "return3": 0.9732095490716178, "return4": 1.000516662361147, "1_day_return": -0.8788739840084658, "cumulative_return1": 5.89880125536883, "cumulative_return1&2": 3.7572218560154735, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 7.695453632529563, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 34.382833760677684, "indexx": 1364, "returnpred": 0.8788739840084665, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9875373542691973, "cumreturn1b": 1.1500215724411105, "cumreturn1c": 1.0249060220813482, "cumreturndow": 1.0041425983871153, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0163477376417005}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1371, "level_0": 1406, "index": 72687, "text": "ITEM 2.

PPG MAY MAKE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS IN 2019 AND BEYOND.  A PRIMARY FOCUS FOR THE COMPANY IN 2019 WILL CONTINUE TO BE CASH DEPLOYMENT FOCUSED ON LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE CREATION.  PPG'S RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT, INCLUDING FINANCE LEASES, TO TOTAL DEBT AND EQUITY WAS  52%  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL IS A SUBSET OF TOTAL WORKING CAPITAL AND REPRESENTS (1) TRADE RECEIVABLES \u2013 NET OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, (2) FIFO INVENTORIES AND (3) TRADE LIABILITIES. WE BELIEVE OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL REPRESENTS THE KEY COMPONENTS OF WORKING CAPITAL UNDER THE OPERATING CONTROL OF OUR BUSINESSES. A KEY METRIC WE USE TO MEASURE IMPROVEMENT IN OUR WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IS OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES (CURRENT QUARTER SALES ANNUALIZED).

THE PROGRAM IS LARGELY CENTERED AROUND THE CHANGE IN CUSTOMER ASSORTMENT RELATED TO THE U.S. ARCHITECTURAL COATINGS DIY BUSINESS. PPG RECOGNIZED $18 MILLION OF SAVINGS FROM THIS PROGRAM IN 2018. WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE ANNUALIZED COST SAVINGS FROM THE 2018 PROGRAM OF $85 MILLION ONCE FULLY IMPLEMENTED IN 2020.  IN JUNE 2019, PPG INITIATED AN APPROXIMATELY $185 MILLION RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM IS A RESULT OF A COMPREHENSIVE INTERNAL OPERATIONAL ASSESSMENT TO IDENTIFY FURTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE PROFITABILITY OF THE OVERALL BUSINESS PORTFOLIO. THE 2019 PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE APPROXIMATELY $125 MILLION OF ANNUALIZED COST SAVINGS BY THE EXPECTED COMPLETION DATE IN 2022.  TOTAL RESTRUCTURING SAVINGS ARE EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN $75 MILLION AND $85 MILLION IN 2019. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO REVIEW ITS COST STRUCTURE TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL COST SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES.

WE BASE OUR ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, WE EVALUATE OUR ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES, AND MAKE CHANGES AS DEEMED NECESSARY.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED  CREDIT LOSSES  IN JUNE 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d) ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13, \u201cMEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,\u201d WHICH SUPERSEDES CURRENT GUIDANCE REQUIRING RECOGNITION OF CREDIT LOSSES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. THE NEW STANDARD REQUIRES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL ASSETS, INCLUDING TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, AT EACH REPORTING DATE. THE NEW STANDARD WILL RESULT IN EARLIER RECOGNITION OF ALLOWANCES FOR LOSSES ON TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS TO RECEIVE CASH. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING THIS STANDARD TO ASSESS THE IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURES.  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT  IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-04, \u201cSIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT,\u201d THAT ELIMINATES \u201cSTEP 2\u201d FROM THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST.

REVENUE  WE PRIMARILY GENERATE REVENUE FROM LICENSING OUR SOFTWARE AND IP, SELLING OR LEASING OUR EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE TECHNOLOGY, PROVIDING MAINTENANCE FOR OUR SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND IP, PROVIDING ENGINEERING SERVICES AND EARNING ROYALTIES GENERATED FROM THE USE OF OUR IP. THE TIMING OF OUR REVENUE IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE MIX OF SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND IP PRODUCTS GENERATING REVENUE IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD AND WHETHER THE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME OR AT A POINT IN TIME, UPON COMPLETION OF DELIVERY.  WE EXPECT THAT BETWEEN 85% AND 90% OF OUR REVENUE WILL BE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME DURING FISCAL 2019, WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE RESULTING REVENUE RECOGNIZED AT THE POINT IN TIME THAT CONTROL IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. REVENUE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME INCLUDES REVENUE FROM OUR SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS, SERVICES, ROYALTIES FROM CERTAIN IP ARRANGEMENTS, MAINTENANCE ON IP LICENSES AND HARDWARE, AND OPERATING LEASES OF HARDWARE. REVENUE RECOGNIZED AT A POINT IN TIME IS PRIMARILY GENERATED BY OUR SALES OF EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE AND IP LICENSES. OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THIS MIX IN ANY SINGLE FISCAL PERIOD MAY BE IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY DELIVERY OF HARDWARE AND IP PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS.  REVENUE BY PERIOD  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS OUR REVENUE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2018  AND THE CHANGE IN REVENUE BETWEEN PERIODS.

CERTAIN OF OUR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS ALLOW CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO REMIX AMONG SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS THAT INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF OUR PRODUCTS, WITH THE ACTUAL PRODUCT SELECTION AND NUMBER OF LICENSED USERS TO BE DETERMINED AT A LATER DATE. FOR THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE ESTIMATE THE ALLOCATION OF THE REVENUE TO PRODUCT GROUPS BASED UPON THE EXPECTED USAGE OF OUR PRODUCTS.

THE CHANGES IN PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE-RELATED COSTS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , WERE DUE TO THE FOLLOWING.

GROSS MARGINS ON OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE, PRODUCT COMPETITION, PRODUCT MIX AND PRICING STRATEGIES.  COST OF SERVICES  COST OF SERVICES PRIMARILY INCLUDES EMPLOYEE SALARY, BENEFITS AND OTHER EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS TO PERFORM WORK ON REVENUE-GENERATING PROJECTS AND COSTS TO MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO MANAGE A SERVICES ORGANIZATION.

OPERATING EXPENSES  OUR OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE MARKETING AND SALES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. FACTORS THAT TEND TO CAUSE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES TO FLUCTUATE INCLUDE CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES DUE TO HIRING AND ACQUISITIONS, RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND THE IMPACT OF OUR VARIABLE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS THAT ARE DRIVEN BY OPERATING RESULTS.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION INCLUDED IN OUR OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , PRIMARILY BECAUSE SUCCESSIVE INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK BETWEEN GRANT DATES HAVE RESULTED IN HIGHER GRANT DATE FAIR VALUES FOR THE MIX OF STOCK AWARDS EXPENSED IN EACH PERIOD.  MANY OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE TRANSACTED IN VARIOUS FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE RECOGNIZE LOWER EXPENSES IN PERIODS WHEN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR STRENGTHENS IN VALUE AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES AND WE RECOGNIZE HIGHER EXPENSES WHEN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR WEAKENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES.

OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2019  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $5.8 MILLION AND $20.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION THAT VESTED OR WAS EXERCISED DURING THE PERIOD.  OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF THE  U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cTAX ACT\u201d) AND STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES ON ANTICIPATED FISCAL 2018 INCOME. OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $1.8 MILLION AND $10.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION THAT VESTED OR WAS EXERCISED DURING THE PERIOD. WE ALSO REDUCED OUR PROVISIONAL ESTIMATE FOR THE FISCAL 2017 DEEMED REPATRIATION TRANSITION TAX DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 BY $2.6 MILLION, BASED ON OUR CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF THE EARNINGS AND CASH BALANCES OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE APPLICABLE TAX AUTHORITIES.  OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES MAY BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY TAX AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS AT RATES DIFFERENT FROM THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE, RESEARCH CREDITS, THE TAX IMPACT OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, CLOSURE OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS OR SETTLEMENT OF TAX AUDITS, CHANGES IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE AND CHANGES IN TAX LAW. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS IS GENERATED BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES ORGANIZED IN IRELAND AND HUNGARY. OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR EARNINGS WERE TO BE LOWER IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT OUR FISCAL 2019 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL BE APPROXIMATELY  12%  . WE EXPECT THAT OUR QUARTERLY EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WILL VARY FROM OUR FISCAL 2019 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AS A RESULT OF RECOGNIZING THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS IN THE PERIODS WHEN THE AWARDS VEST OR ARE SETTLED AS WELL AS OTHER ITEMS THAT WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE.

OUR PRIMARY USES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2019  WERE PAYMENTS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SALARIES AND BENEFITS, OPERATING EXPENSES, PAYMENTS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, PAYMENT OF TAXES ON VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK HELD BY EMPLOYEES, PURCHASES OF NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS AND PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  APPROXIMATELY  53%  OF OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AS OF  JUNE 29, 2019  . OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES MAY VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO THE TIMING OF COLLECTIONS AND REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS.

THE INCREASE IN OUR NET WORKING CAPITAL AS OF  JUNE 29, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND DISBURSEMENTS MADE TO VENDORS.

THE INCREASE IN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS AND TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND DISBURSEMENTS MADE TO VENDORS.

REVENUES  OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND HEAVILY ON SUCCESSFULLY LEASING AND OPERATING THE OFFICE SPACE IN OUR PORTFOLIO. ECONOMIC GROWTH AND OFFICE EMPLOYMENT LEVELS IN OUR CORE MARKETS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, IN PREDICTING OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.  THE KEY COMPONENTS AFFECTING OUR RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES ARE AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, RENTAL RATES, COST RECOVERY INCOME, NEW DEVELOPMENTS PLACED IN SERVICE, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS. AVERAGE OCCUPANCY GENERALLY INCREASES DURING TIMES OF IMPROVING ECONOMIC GROWTH, AS OUR ABILITY TO LEASE SPACE OUTPACES VACANCIES THAT OCCUR UPON THE EXPIRATIONS OF EXISTING LEASES. AVERAGE OCCUPANCY GENERALLY DECLINES DURING TIMES OF SLOWER OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH, WHEN NEW VACANCIES TEND TO OUTPACE OUR ABILITY TO LEASE SPACE. ASSET ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS PLACED IN SERVICE DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR RENTAL REVENUES AND COULD IMPACT OUR AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, DEPENDING UPON THE OCCUPANCY RATE OF THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE ACQUIRED, SOLD OR PLACED IN SERVICE. A FURTHER INDICATOR OF THE PREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE REVENUES IS THE EXPECTED LEASE EXPIRATIONS OF OUR PORTFOLIO. AS A RESULT, IN ADDITION TO SEEKING TO INCREASE OUR AVERAGE OCCUPANCY BY LEASING CURRENT VACANT SPACE, WE ALSO CONCENTRATE OUR LEASING EFFORTS ON RENEWING EXISTING LEASES PRIOR TO EXPIRATION. FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING OUR LEASE EXPIRATIONS, SEE \"PROPERTIES - LEASE EXPIRATIONS\" IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. OCCUPANCY IN OUR OFFICE PORTFOLIO DECREASED FROM  91.6%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  TO  90.5%  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  . WE EXPECT AVERAGE OCCUPANCY FOR OUR OFFICE PORTFOLIO TO BE APPROXIMATELY  91%  FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  WHETHER OR NOT OUR RENTAL REVENUE TRACKS AVERAGE OCCUPANCY PROPORTIONALLY DEPENDS UPON WHETHER GAAP RENTS UNDER SIGNED NEW AND RENEWAL LEASES ARE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE GAAP RENTS UNDER EXPIRING LEASES. ANNUALIZED RENTAL REVENUES FROM SECOND GENERATION LEASES EXPIRING DURING ANY PARTICULAR YEAR ARE TYPICALLY LESS THAN 15% OF OUR TOTAL ANNUAL RENTAL REVENUES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH INFORMATION REGARDING SECOND GENERATION OFFICE LEASES SIGNED DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  (WE DEFINE SECOND GENERATION OFFICE LEASES AS LEASES WITH NEW CUSTOMERS AND RENEWALS OF EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN OFFICE SPACE THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED UNDER OUR OWNERSHIP AND LEASES WITH RESPECT TO VACANT SPACE IN ACQUIRED BUILDINGS).  NEW  RENEWAL  ALL OFFICE  LEASED SPACE (IN RENTABLE SQUARE FEET)  328,989  746,761  1,075,750  AVERAGE TERM (IN YEARS - RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT WEIGHTED)  6.7  5.0  5.5  BASE RENTS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $30.39  $30.69  $30.60  RENT CONCESSIONS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  (1.00  )  (0.25  )  (0.48  )  GAAP RENTS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $29.39  $30.44  $30.12  TENANT IMPROVEMENTS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $4.97  $2.21  $3.05  LEASING COMMISSIONS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $1.11  $0.87  $0.94  __________  (1)  WEIGHTED AVERAGE PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  ANNUAL COMBINED GAAP RENTS FOR NEW AND RENEWAL LEASES SIGNED IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER WERE  $30.12  PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT,  16.8%  HIGHER  COMPARED TO PREVIOUS LEASES IN THE SAME OFFICE SPACES.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSE, STABLE AND CREDITWORTHY CUSTOMER BASE. WE HAVE AN INTERNAL GUIDELINE WHEREBY CUSTOMERS THAT ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 3% OF OUR REVENUES ARE PERIODICALLY REVIEWED WITH THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , NO CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN  3%  OF OUR CASH REVENUES OTHER THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR LESS THAN  5%  OF OUR CASH REVENUES ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. UPON COMPLETION OF THE METLIFE III DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN RALEIGH, IT IS EXPECTED THAT METLIFE WILL ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY  3.4%  OF OUR REVENUES BASED ON ANNUALIZED CASH REVENUES FOR  JUNE 2019.  EXPENSES  OUR EXPENSES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF RENTAL PROPERTY EXPENSES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND INTEREST EXPENSE. FROM TIME TO TIME, EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS. RENTAL PROPERTY EXPENSES ARE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF RENTAL PROPERTIES AND INCLUDE EXPENSES THAT VARY SOMEWHAT PROPORTIONATELY TO OCCUPANCY LEVELS, SUCH AS JANITORIAL SERVICES AND UTILITIES, AND EXPENSES THAT DO NOT VARY BASED ON OCCUPANCY, SUCH AS PROPERTY TAXES AND INSURANCE. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION IS A NON-CASH EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE OWNERSHIP OF REAL PROPERTY AND GENERALLY REMAINS RELATIVELY CONSISTENT EACH YEAR, UNLESS WE BUY, PLACE IN SERVICE OR SELL ASSETS, SINCE OUR PROPERTIES AND RELATED BUILDING AND TENANT IMPROVEMENT ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER FIXED LIVES. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEE SALARIES AND BENEFITS, CORPORATE OVERHEAD AND SHORT AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  NET OPERATING INCOME  WHETHER OR NOT WE RECORD INCREASING SAME PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME (\u201cNOI\u201d) DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO GARNER HIGHER RENTAL REVENUES, WHETHER FROM HIGHER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, HIGHER GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT OR HIGHER COST RECOVERY INCOME, THAT EXCEED ANY CORRESPONDING GROWTH IN OPERATING EXPENSES. SAME PROPERTY NOI WAS  $2.6 MILLION  , OR  2.3%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SAME PROPERTY REVENUES OF  $3.4 MILLION  OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF  $0.7 MILLION  IN SAME PROPERTY EXPENSES. WE EXPECT SAME PROPERTY NOI TO BE HIGHER IN THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 AS HIGHER RENTAL REVENUES, MOSTLY FROM HIGHER AVERAGE GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT, ARE EXPECTED TO MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER EXPECTED AVERAGE OCCUPANCY AND AN ANTICIPATED INCREASE IN SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES.  IN ADDITION TO THE EFFECT OF SAME PROPERTY NOI, WHETHER OR NOT NOI INCREASES DEPENDS UPON WHETHER THE NOI FROM OUR ACQUIRED PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE EXCEEDS THE NOI FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS. NOI WAS  $4.4 MILLION  , OR  3.7%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO THE IMPACT OF DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE, PARTLY OFFSET BY NOI LOST FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS AND LOWER RESTORATION FEES. WE EXPECT NOI TO BE HIGHER IN THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 DUE TO THE IMPACT OF OUR NET INVESTMENT ACTIVITY IN SUCH PERIODS.  CASH FLOWS  IN CALCULATING NET CASH RELATED TO OPERATING ACTIVITIES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, WHICH ARE NON-CASH EXPENSES, ARE ADDED BACK TO NET INCOME. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY GENERATED A POSITIVE AMOUNT OF CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON CHANGES IN OUR NET INCOME, AS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY BELOW UNDER \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d CHANGES IN RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES AND NET ADDITIONS OR DECREASES IN OUR OVERALL PORTFOLIO.  NET CASH RELATED TO INVESTING ACTIVITIES GENERALLY RELATES TO CAPITALIZED COSTS INCURRED FOR LEASING AND MAJOR BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS AND OUR ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT, DISPOSITION AND JOINT VENTURE ACTIVITY. DURING PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT NET ACQUISITION AND/OR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY, OUR CASH USED IN SUCH INVESTING ACTIVITIES WILL GENERALLY EXCEED CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES, WHICH TYPICALLY CONSISTS OF CASH RECEIVED UPON THE SALE OF PROPERTIES AND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR JOINT VENTURES.  NET CASH RELATED TO FINANCING ACTIVITIES GENERALLY RELATES TO DISTRIBUTIONS, INCURRENCE AND REPAYMENT OF DEBT, AND ISSUANCES, REPURCHASES OR REDEMPTIONS OF COMMON STOCK, COMMON UNITS AND PREFERRED STOCK. WE USE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR CASH TO FUND DISTRIBUTIONS. WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE INCREASES IN THE OUTSTANDING BALANCES OF DEBT DURING A PERIOD DEPENDS GENERALLY UPON THE NET EFFECT OF OUR ACQUISITION, DISPOSITION, DEVELOPMENT AND JOINT VENTURE ACTIVITY. WE GENERALLY USE OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR DAILY WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES, WHICH MEANS THAT DURING ANY GIVEN PERIOD, IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE INTEREST EXPENSE, WE MAY RECORD SIGNIFICANT REPAYMENTS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  FOR A DISCUSSION REGARDING DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS, SEE \"LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.\"  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN A CONSERVATIVE AND FLEXIBLE BALANCE SHEET WITH ACCESS TO MULTIPLE SOURCES OF DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL AND SUFFICIENT AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT ALLOWS US TO CAPITALIZE ON FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY ARISE.  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES ARE OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF FUNDS TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS INCLUDE AVAILABLE WORKING CAPITAL AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH HAD  $478.9 MILLION  OF AVAILABILITY AT  JULY 16, 2019  . OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF OPERATING EXPENSES, INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL AMORTIZATION ON OUR DEBT, DISTRIBUTIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING BUILDING IMPROVEMENT COSTS, TENANT IMPROVEMENT COSTS AND LEASE COMMISSIONS. BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITAL COSTS TO MAINTAIN OR ENHANCE EXISTING BUILDINGS NOT TYPICALLY RELATED TO A SPECIFIC CUSTOMER. TENANT IMPROVEMENTS ARE THE COSTS REQUIRED TO CUSTOMIZE SPACE FOR THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND PLANNED FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. WE USE OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES AND FOR THE SHORT-TERM FUNDING OF OUR DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE REPAYMENT OF OTHER DEBT. CONTINUED ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ALLOWS US TO QUICKLY CAPITALIZE ON STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES AT SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES.  OUR LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY USES GENERALLY CONSIST OF THE RETIREMENT OR REFINANCING OF DEBT UPON MATURITY, FUNDING OF BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS, NEW BUILDING DEVELOPMENTS AND LAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND FUNDING ACQUISITIONS OF BUILDINGS AND DEVELOPMENT LAND. OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR STARTED AND/OR COMMITTED NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WERE APPROXIMATELY  $316 MILLION  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  . ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, RETIRE OUTSTANDING EQUITY AND/OR DEBT SECURITIES THROUGH REDEMPTIONS, OPEN MARKET REPURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED ACQUISITIONS OR OTHERWISE.  WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF.  \u2022  CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES;  \u2022  BANK TERM LOANS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY;  \u2022  THE ISSUANCE OF UNSECURED DEBT;  \u2022  THE ISSUANCE OF SECURED DEBT;  \u2022  THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE COMPANY OR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP; AND  \u2022  THE DISPOSITION OF NON-CORE ASSETS.  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , OUR LEVERAGE RATIO, AS MEASURED BY THE RATIO OF OUR MORTGAGES AND NOTES PAYABLE AND OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK TO THE UNDEPRECIATED BOOK VALUE OF OUR ASSETS, WAS  35.9%  AND THERE WERE  106.4 MILLION  DILUTED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING.  INVESTMENT ACTIVITY  AS NOTED ABOVE, A KEY TENET OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN IS TO CONTINUOUSLY UPGRADE THE QUALITY OF OUR OFFICE PORTFOLIO THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND DEVELOPMENT. WE GENERALLY SEEK TO ACQUIRE AND DEVELOP OFFICE BUILDINGS THAT IMPROVE THE AVERAGE QUALITY OF OUR OVERALL PORTFOLIO AND DELIVER CONSISTENT AND SUSTAINABLE VALUE FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS OVER THE LONG-TERM. WHETHER OR NOT AN ASSET ACQUISITION OR NEW DEVELOPMENT RESULTS IN HIGHER PER SHARE NET INCOME OR FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\"FFO\") IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE NOI FOR ANY SUCH PERIOD EXCEEDS THE ACTUAL COST OF CAPITAL USED TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT. ADDITIONALLY, GIVEN THE LENGTH OF CONSTRUCTION CYCLES, DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE NOT PLACED IN SERVICE UNTIL, IN SOME CASES, SEVERAL YEARS AFTER COMMENCEMENT. SALES OF NON-CORE ASSETS COULD RESULT IN LOWER PER SHARE NET INCOME OR FFO IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD IN THE EVENT THE RESULTING USE OF PROCEEDS DOES NOT EXCEED THE CAPITALIZATION RATE ON THE SOLD PROPERTIES.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE  $5.3 MILLION  , OR  3.0%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY REVENUES, WHICH INCREASED RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES BY $6.4 MILLION AND $3.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT AND HIGHER PARKING INCOME, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY LOST REVENUE FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS AND LOWER RESTORATION FEES, WHICH DECREASED RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES BY $2.8 MILLION AND $1.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPECT RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES TO BE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY REVENUES, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOST REVENUE FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  OPERATING EXPENSES  RENTAL PROPERTY AND OTHER EXPENSES WERE  $0.9 MILLION  , OR  1.5%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES BY $1.2 MILLION AND $0.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES AND INSURANCE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY A $1.1 MILLION DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS. WE EXPECT RENTAL PROPERTY AND OTHER EXPENSES TO BE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS  $2.8 MILLION  , OR  4.9%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY LEASE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, PARTLY OFFSET BY FULLY AMORTIZED ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS. WE EXPECT DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION TO BE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 FOR SIMILAR REASONS.  WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF  $0.5 MILLION  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  , WHICH RESULTED FROM A CHANGE IN MARKET-BASED INPUTS AND OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF THE ASSETS. WE RECORDED NO SUCH IMPAIRMENT IN  2018.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE RELATIVELY UNCHANGED IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED LEASE RELATED COSTS THAT ARE NOW EXPENSED UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD IN 2019 AND HIGHER COMPANY-WIDE BASE SALARIES AND BENEFITS OFFSET BY LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND LOWER EXPENSED PRE-DEVELOPMENT COSTS. WE EXPECT GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 TO BE RELATIVELY CONSISTENT TO 2018 FOR SIMILAR REASONS.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $2.5 MILLION  , OR  13.9%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES, HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES AND LOWER CAPITALIZED INTEREST. WE EXPECT INTEREST EXPENSE TO BE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 FOR SIMILAR REASONS.  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS)  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS) WAS  $0.1 MILLION  LOWER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INTEREST INCOME.  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY WERE  $10.3 MILLION  LOWER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO THE NET EFFECT OF THE DISPOSITION ACTIVITY IN SUCH PERIODS.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES WAS  $0.2 MILLION  , OR  40.1%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY. WE EXPECT EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES TO BE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 FOR THE SAME REASON.  EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE - DILUTED  DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WAS  $0.11  LOWER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO A DECREASE IN NET INCOME FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  LASER SPINE INSTITUTE  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE PROVIDED INFORMATION ON LASER SPINE INSTITUTE, WHICH OCCUPIED A 176,000 SQUARE-FOOT, SIX-STORY BUILDING WITH STRUCTURED PARKING IN TAMPA\u2019S WESTSHORE SUBMARKET, A BBD. THE BUILDING, DEVELOPED BY US, HAD BEEN USED BY LASER SPINE INSTITUTE FOR BOTH ITS COMPANY HEADQUARTERS AND AN AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTER. AFTER THE MARKET CLOSED ON MARCH 1, 2019, LASER SPINE INSTITUTE ANNOUNCED IT WOULD IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE ITS OPERATIONS. THIS UNEXPECTED ANNOUNCEMENT AFFECTED ALL OF ITS LOCATIONS NATIONWIDE. AS A RESULT OF THIS SUDDEN CLOSURE, WE INCURRED $5.6 MILLION OF CREDIT LOSSES ON OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES AND WRITE-OFFS OF $2.3 MILLION OF LEASE INCENTIVES, $4.1 MILLION OF NOTES RECEIVABLE AND $11.6 MILLION OF TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND DEFERRED LEASING COSTS.  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE  $2.8 MILLION  , OR  0.8%  ,  LOWER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS, LOWER SAME PROPERTY REVENUES AND LOWER RESTORATION FEES, WHICH DECREASED RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES BY $5.3 MILLION, $4.1 MILLION AND $3.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE LOWER PRIMARILY DUE TO CREDIT LOSSES ON OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES AND WRITE-OFFS OF LEASE INCENTIVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LASER SPINE INSTITUTE, PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AVERAGE GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT AND HIGHER PARKING INCOME. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER REVENUE OF $10.4 MILLION FROM DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE.  OPERATING EXPENSES  RENTAL PROPERTY AND OTHER EXPENSES WERE  $2.0 MILLION  , OR  1.7%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES BY $2.1 MILLION AND $1.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES AND REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER UTILITIES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY A $1.7 MILLION DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS  $14.4 MILLION  , OR  12.6%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND DEFERRED LEASING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LASER SPINE INSTITUTE AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE, PARTLY OFFSET BY PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF  $0.5 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  , WHICH RESULTED FROM A CHANGE IN MARKET-BASED INPUTS AND OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF THE ASSETS. WE RECORDED NO SUCH IMPAIRMENT IN  2018.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  $0.6 MILLION  , OR  2.9%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED LEASE RELATED COSTS THAT ARE NOW EXPENSED UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD IN 2019 AND HIGHER COMPANY-WIDE BASE SALARIES AND BENEFITS, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND EXPENSED PRE-DEVELOPMENT COSTS.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $2.8 MILLION  , OR  7.8%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES AND HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS)  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS) WAS  $4.4 MILLION  LOWER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO THE WRITE-OFF OF NOTES RECEIVABLE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LASER SPINE INSTITUTE.  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY WERE  $10.3 MILLION  LOWER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO THE NET EFFECT OF THE DISPOSITION ACTIVITY IN SUCH PERIODS.  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES WAS  $0.4 MILLION  , OR  33.8%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY.  EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE - DILUTED  DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WAS  $0.35  LOWER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO A DECREASE IN NET INCOME FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE.

WE EXPECT NET CASH RELATED TO OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 TO BE HIGHER AS COMPARED TO 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND SAME PROPERTIES, PARTLY OFFSET BY PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ACQUISITION ACTIVITY AND HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN DEVELOPMENT IN-PROCESS IN 2018. WE EXPECT USES OF CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 TO BE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY WHETHER OR NOT WE ACQUIRE OR COMMENCE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE BBDS OF OUR MARKETS. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY  $316 MILLION  LEFT TO FUND OF OUR PREVIOUSLY-ANNOUNCED DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY IN 2019 AND FUTURE YEARS. WE EXPECT THESE USES OF CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WILL BE PARTLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET DEBT BORROWINGS IN 2019. ASSUMING THE NET EFFECT OF OUR ACQUISITION, DISPOSITION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY IN 2019 RESULTS IN AN INCREASE TO OUR ASSETS, WE WOULD EXPECT OUTSTANDING DEBT AND/OR COMMON STOCK BALANCES TO INCREASE.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CAPITALIZATION  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE COMPANY\u2019S CAPITALIZATION (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS).

THE SECURED INDEBTEDNESS WAS COLLATERALIZED BY REAL ESTATE ASSETS WITH AN UNDEPRECIATED BOOK VALUE OF  $146.2 MILLION  . AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  ,  $486.0 MILLION  OF OUR DEBT DOES NOT BEAR INTEREST AT FIXED RATES OR IS NOT PROTECTED BY INTEREST RATE HEDGE CONTRACTS.  INVESTMENT ACTIVITY  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE REGULARLY EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS. AS A RESULT, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY HAVE ONE OR MORE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION THAT ARE IN VARYING STAGES OF EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION OR DUE DILIGENCE, INCLUDING POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO NON-BINDING LETTERS OF INTENT OR ENFORCEABLE CONTRACTS. CONSUMMATION OF ANY TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING THE SATISFACTION OF CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE PROVIDED THAT WE WILL ACQUIRE ANY PROPERTIES IN THE FUTURE. SEE \"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - RECENT AND FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES MAY FAIL TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS AND MAY REQUIRE RENOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS EXCEEDING OUR ESTIMATES\" IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE AND THE BROMLEY COMPANIES FORMED A JOINT VENTURE (THE \"MIDTOWN ONE JOINT VENTURE\u201d) TO CONSTRUCT MIDTOWN ONE, A  150,000  SQUARE FOOT, MULTI-CUSTOMER OFFICE BUILDING LOCATED IN THE MIXED-USE MIDTOWN TAMPA PROJECT IN TAMPA\u2019S WESTSHORE SUBMARKET. MIDTOWN ONE HAS AN ANTICIPATED TOTAL INVESTMENT OF  $71.3 MILLION  . CONSTRUCTION OF MIDTOWN ONE IS PROJECTED TO BEGIN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 WITH A SCHEDULED COMPLETION DATE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2021. AT CLOSING, WE AGREED TO CONTRIBUTE CASH OF  $20.0 MILLION  (  $12.8 MILLION  OF WHICH WAS FUNDED AND/OR PLACED IN ESCROW AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  ) IN EXCHANGE FOR AN  80.0%  INTEREST IN THE MIDTOWN ONE JOINT VENTURE AND THE BROMLEY COMPANIES CONTRIBUTED LAND VALUED AT  $5.0 MILLION  IN EXCHANGE FOR THE REMAINING  20.0%  INTEREST. WE ALSO COMMITTED TO PROVIDE A  $46.3 MILLION  INTEREST-ONLY SECURED CONSTRUCTION LOAN TO THE MIDTOWN ONE JOINT VENTURE THAT IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE ON THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF COMPLETION. THE LOAN BEARS INTEREST AT  LIBOR PLUS 250 BASIS POINTS  . AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , NO AMOUNTS UNDER THE LOAN HAVE BEEN FUNDED. THE MIDTOWN ONE JOINT VENTURE IS CONSOLIDATED.  ON JULY 3, 2019, WE SOLD LAND PARCELS FOR AN AGGREGATE SALE PRICE OF  $7.3 MILLION  AND EXPECT TO RECORD NOMINAL AGGREGATE LOSSES ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY.  ON JULY 8, 2019, WE SOLD A BUILDING FOR A SALE PRICE OF  $4.7 MILLION  AND EXPECT TO RECORD A GAIN ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY OF  $2.6 MILLION.  ON JULY 12, 2019, WE ACQUIRED DEVELOPMENT LAND IN RALEIGH FOR A PURCHASE PRICE, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED ACQUISITION COSTS, OF  $6.6 MILLION.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE SOLD  TWO  BUILDINGS AND LAND FOR AN AGGREGATE SALE PRICE OF  $32.5 MILLION  AND RECORDED AGGREGATE GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY OF  $6.7 MILLION.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF  $0.5 MILLION  , WHICH RESULTED FROM A CHANGE IN MARKET-BASED INPUTS AND OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF THE ASSETS.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE WERE DEVELOPING  0.8 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE PROPERTIES.

RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN LAND HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS, NOT DEVELOPMENT IN-PROCESS.  FINANCING ACTIVITY  WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SEPARATE EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WITH EACH OF WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, ROBERT W. BAIRD & CO. INCORPORATED, BB&T CAPITAL MARKETS, A DIVISION OF BB&T SECURITIES, LLC, MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED, BTIG, LLC, CAPITAL ONE SECURITIES, INC., FIFTH THIRD SECURITIES, INC., JEFFERIES LLC AND J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY MAY OFFER AND SELL UP TO $300.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE GROSS SALES PRICE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH SUCH FIRMS, ACTING AS AGENTS OF THE COMPANY OR AS PRINCIPALS. SALES OF THE SHARES, IF ANY, MAY BE MADE BY MEANS OF ORDINARY BROKERS\u2019 TRANSACTIONS ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (\"NYSE\") OR OTHERWISE AT MARKET PRICES PREVAILING AT THE TIME OF SALE, AT PRICES RELATED TO PREVAILING MARKET PRICES OR AT NEGOTIATED PRICES OR AS OTHERWISE AGREED WITH ANY OF SUCH FIRMS.  OUR $600.0 MILLION  UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN  JANUARY 2022  AND INCLUDES AN ACCORDION FEATURE THAT ALLOWS FOR AN ADDITIONAL  $400.0 MILLION  OF BORROWING CAPACITY SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL LENDER COMMITMENTS. ASSUMING NO DEFAULTS HAVE OCCURRED, WE HAVE AN OPTION TO EXTEND THE MATURITY FOR  TWO  ADDITIONAL  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS. THE INTEREST RATE AT OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS IS  LIBOR PLUS 100 BASIS POINTS  AND THE ANNUAL FACILITY FEE IS 20 BASIS POINTS. THE INTEREST RATE AND FACILITY FEE ARE BASED ON THE HIGHER OF THE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED RATINGS FROM MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE OR STANDARD & POOR'S RATINGS SERVICES. THERE WAS  $136.0 MILLION  AND  $121.0 MILLION  OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  JULY 16, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. AT BOTH  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  JULY 16, 2019  , WE HAD  $0.1 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT, WHICH REDUCES THE AVAILABILITY ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. AS A RESULT, THE UNUSED CAPACITY OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  JULY 16, 2019  WAS $463.9 MILLION  AND  $478.9 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  WE ARE CURRENTLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED DEBT. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AND RATIOS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT YEAR, DEPENDING UPON OUR FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE, PROPERTY AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE.  OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND BANK TERM LOANS REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH CUSTOMARY OPERATING COVENANTS AND VARIOUS FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. UPON AN EVENT OF DEFAULT ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE LENDERS HAVING AT LEAST 51.0% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CAN ACCELERATE ALL BORROWINGS THEN OUTSTANDING, AND WE COULD BE PROHIBITED FROM BORROWING ANY FURTHER AMOUNTS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT AGREEMENTS CONTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS GIVING THE UNSECURED LENDERS THE RIGHT TO DECLARE A DEFAULT IF WE ARE IN DEFAULT UNDER MORE THAN $30.0 MILLION WITH RESPECT TO OTHER LOANS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE INDENTURE THAT GOVERNS THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP'S OUTSTANDING NOTES REQUIRES US TO COMPLY WITH CUSTOMARY OPERATING COVENANTS AND VARIOUS FINANCIAL RATIOS. THE TRUSTEE OR THE HOLDERS OF AT LEAST 25.0% IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ANY SERIES OF NOTES CAN ACCELERATE THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SUCH SERIES UPON WRITTEN NOTICE OF A DEFAULT THAT REMAINS UNCURED AFTER 60 DAYS.  WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPAY, REFINANCE OR EXTEND ANY OR ALL OF OUR DEBT AT MATURITY OR UPON ANY ACCELERATION. IF ANY REFINANCING IS DONE AT HIGHER INTEREST RATES, THE INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW AND ABILITY TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS. ANY SUCH REFINANCING COULD ALSO IMPOSE TIGHTER FINANCIAL RATIOS AND OTHER COVENANTS THAT RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COULD OTHERWISE BE IN OUR BEST INTEREST, SUCH AS FUNDING NEW DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY, MAKING OPPORTUNISTIC ACQUISITIONS, REPURCHASING OUR SECURITIES OR PAYING DISTRIBUTIONS.  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS  TO MAINTAIN ITS QUALIFICATION AS A REIT, THE COMPANY MUST PAY DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS THAT ARE AT LEAST 90.0% OF ITS ANNUAL REIT TAXABLE INCOME, EXCLUDING NET CAPITAL GAINS. THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO DISTRIBUTE AT LEAST ENOUGH CASH FOR THE COMPANY TO BE ABLE TO PAY SUCH DIVIDENDS. THE COMPANY'S REIT TAXABLE INCOME, AS DETERMINED BY THE FEDERAL TAX LAWS, DOES NOT EQUAL ITS NET INCOME UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d). IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH CAPITAL GAINS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO MAINTAIN REIT STATUS, CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX UNLESS SUCH GAINS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO STOCKHOLDERS.  CASH DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CASH THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER BUSINESS PURPOSES, INCLUDING FUNDING DEBT MATURITIES, REDUCING DEBT OR FUTURE GROWTH INITIATIVES. THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS THAT WILL BE MADE IS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS THAT WILL AFFECT SUCH CASH FLOWS AND, ACCORDINGLY, INFLUENCE THE DECISIONS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS, SEE \"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS\" IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  , THE COMPANY DECLARED AND PAID A CASH DIVIDEND OF  $0.475  PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK.  CURRENT AND FUTURE CASH NEEDS  WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER AVAILABLE FINANCING SOURCES, INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, THE ISSUANCE OF SECURED DEBT, BANK TERM LOANS, BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE COMPANY OR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND THE DISPOSITION OF NON-CORE ASSETS, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS.  WE HAD  $4.5 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  . THE UNUSED CAPACITY OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  JULY 16, 2019  WAS  $463.9 MILLION  AND  $478.9 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, EXCLUDING AN ACCORDION FEATURE THAT ALLOWS FOR AN ADDITIONAL  $400.0 MILLION  OF BORROWING CAPACITY SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL LENDER COMMITMENTS.  WE HAVE A CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 WITH THE SEC PURSUANT TO WHICH, AT ANY TIME AND FROM TIME TO TIME, IN ONE OR MORE OFFERINGS ON AN AS-NEEDED BASIS, THE COMPANY MAY SELL AN INDEFINITE AMOUNT OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK AND DEPOSITARY SHARES AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP MAY SELL AN INDEFINITE AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURITIES, SUBJECT TO OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT OFFERINGS ON SATISFACTORY TERMS BASED ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS.  THE COMPANY FROM TIME TO TIME ENTERS INTO EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WITH A VARIETY OF FIRMS PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY MAY OFFER AND SELL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH SUCH FIRMS, ACTING AS AGENTS OF THE COMPANY OR AS PRINCIPALS. SALES OF THE SHARES, IF ANY, MAY BE MADE BY MEANS OF ORDINARY BROKERS\u2019 TRANSACTIONS ON THE NYSE OR OTHERWISE AT MARKET PRICES PREVAILING AT THE TIME OF SALE, AT PRICES RELATED TO PREVAILING MARKET PRICES OR AT NEGOTIATED PRICES OR AS OTHERWISE AGREED WITH ANY OF SUCH FIRMS (WHICH MAY INCLUDE BLOCK TRADES).  DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019, WE ALSO EXPECT TO SELL AN ADDITIONAL  $62 MILLION  TO  $112 MILLION  OF PROPERTIES NO LONGER CONSIDERED TO BE CORE ASSETS DUE TO LOCATION, AGE, QUALITY AND/OR OVERALL STRATEGIC FIT. WE CAN MAKE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT WE WILL SELL ANY NON-CORE ASSETS OR, IF WE DO, WHAT THE TIMING OR TERMS OF ANY SUCH SALE WILL BE.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THERE WERE NO CHANGES MADE BY MANAGEMENT TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  OTHER THAN THE NEW LEASE STANDARD ADOPTION EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019, WHICH CHANGED OUR POLICY WITH RESPECT TO ESTIMATING CREDIT LOSSES ON OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THIS POLICY, SEE NOTE 2 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF ALL OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, SEE \u201cMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\u201d IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  NON-GAAP INFORMATION  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE ARE BENEFICIAL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS AND ARE IMPORTANT INDICATORS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY EQUITY REIT. BECAUSE THESE FFO CALCULATIONS EXCLUDE SUCH FACTORS AS DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND GAINS OR LOSSES FROM SALES OF OPERATING REAL ESTATE ASSETS, WHICH CAN VARY AMONG OWNERS OF IDENTICAL ASSETS IN SIMILAR CONDITIONS BASED ON HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING AND USEFUL LIFE ESTIMATES, THEY FACILITATE COMPARISONS OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE BETWEEN PERIODS AND BETWEEN OTHER REITS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP IMPLICITLY ASSUMES THAT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS DIMINISHES PREDICTABLY OVER TIME. SINCE REAL ESTATE VALUES HAVE HISTORICALLY RISEN OR FALLEN WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE USE OF FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE, TOGETHER WITH THE REQUIRED GAAP PRESENTATIONS, PROVIDES A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO ITS COMPETITORS AND A MORE INFORMED AND APPROPRIATE BASIS ON WHICH TO MAKE DECISIONS INVOLVING OPERATING, FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND THEREFORE DO NOT REPRESENT NET INCOME OR NET INCOME PER SHARE AS DEFINED BY GAAP. NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER SHARE AS DEFINED BY GAAP ARE THE MOST RELEVANT MEASURES IN DETERMINING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THESE FFO MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS THAT INVESTORS MAY DEEM SUBJECTIVE, SUCH AS ADDING BACK EXPENSES SUCH AS DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENTS. FURTHERMORE, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE DOES NOT DEPICT THE AMOUNT THAT ACCRUES DIRECTLY TO THE STOCKHOLDERS' BENEFIT. ACCORDINGLY, FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE SHOULD NEVER BE CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME, NET INCOME AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS, OR NET INCOME AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE AS INDICATORS OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  THE COMPANY'S PRESENTATION OF FFO IS CONSISTENT WITH FFO AS DEFINED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, WHICH IS CALCULATED AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  NET INCOME/(LOSS) COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP;  \u2022  LESS NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES;  \u2022  PLUS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES;  \u2022  LESS GAINS, OR PLUS LOSSES, FROM SALES OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES, PLUS IMPAIRMENTS ON DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES AND EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS UNDER GAAP;  \u2022  PLUS OR MINUS OUR SHARE OF ADJUSTMENTS, INCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES, FOR UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS (TO REFLECT FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ON THE SAME BASIS); AND  \u2022  PLUS OR MINUS ADJUSTMENTS FOR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND GAINS/(LOSSES) ON SALES OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES, PLUS IMPAIRMENTS ON DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES, AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES RELATED TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  IN CALCULATING FFO, THE COMPANY INCLUDES NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS CONSISTENT WITH STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICE FOR REITS THAT OPERATE THROUGH AN UPREIT STRUCTURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO PRESENT FFO ON AN AS-CONVERTED BASIS SINCE ALL OF THE COMMON UNITS NOT OWNED BY THE COMPANY ARE REDEEMABLE ON A ONE-FOR-ONE BASIS FOR SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE COMPANY'S FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS).

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY BELIEVES NOI AND SAME PROPERTY NOI ARE USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PROPERTY OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE SUCH METRICS PROVIDE A PERFORMANCE MEASURE OF THE REVENUES AND EXPENSES DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN OWNING REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND A PERSPECTIVE NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT FROM NET INCOME OR FFO. THE COMPANY DEFINES NOI AS RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES LESS RENTAL PROPERTY AND OTHER EXPENSES. THE COMPANY DEFINES CASH NOI AS NOI LESS LEASE TERMINATION FEES, STRAIGHT-LINE RENT, AMORTIZATION OF LEASE INCENTIVES AND AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED ABOVE AND BELOW MARKET LEASES. OTHER REITS MAY USE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES TO CALCULATE NOI, SAME PROPERTY NOI AND CASH NOI.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , OUR SAME PROPERTY PORTFOLIO CONSISTED OF  211  IN-SERVICE PROPERTIES ENCOMPASSING  28.7 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET THAT WERE WHOLLY OWNED DURING THE ENTIRETY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED (FROM JANUARY 1,  2018  TO  JUNE 30, 2019  ). AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , OUR SAME PROPERTY PORTFOLIO CONSISTED OF  210  IN-SERVICE PROPERTIES ENCOMPASSING  28.1 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET THAT WERE WHOLLY OWNED DURING THE ENTIRETY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED (FROM JANUARY 1,  2017  TO  DECEMBER 31, 2018  ). THE CHANGE IN OUR SAME PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WAS DUE TO THE ADDITION OF  THREE  NEWLY DEVELOPED PROPERTIES ENCOMPASSING  0.8 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET PLACED IN SERVICE DURING  2017  . THESE ADDITIONS WERE OFFSET BY THE REMOVAL OF  TWO  PROPERTIES ENCOMPASSING  0.2 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET THAT WERE SOLD DURING  2019.

FOLLOWING A MEETING BY OUR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS IN FEBRUARY 2019, WHICH INCLUDED A DISCUSSION OF THE MANAGER\u2019S PERFORMANCE AND THE LEVEL OF THE MANAGEMENT FEES THEREUNDER, WE DETERMINED NOT TO TERMINATE THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  FORWARD CURRENCY CONTRACTS.  WE USE FORWARD CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS DUE UNDER OUR LOANS DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF FORWARD CONTRACTS TO SELL AN AMOUNT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY (BRITISH POUNDS AND EUROS) FOR AN AGREED UPON AMOUNT OF U.S. DOLLARS AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH DECEMBER 2021. THESE FORWARD CONTRACTS WERE EXECUTED TO ECONOMICALLY FIX THE U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF FOREIGN DENOMINATED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED BY US RELATED TO FOREIGN DENOMINATED LOAN INVESTMENTS. REFER TO \"  NOTE 10  - DERIVATIVES, NET\"  32  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DETAILS REGARDING OUR FORWARD CURRENCY CONTRACTS.  UNREALIZED LOSS ON INTEREST RATE SWAP.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE TERM LOAN B, WE ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP TO FIX LIBOR AT  2.12%  , EFFECTIVELY FIXING OUR ALL-IN COUPON ON THE TERM LOAN B AT  4.87%  . REFER TO \"  NOTE 10  - DERIVATIVES, NET\" TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DETAILS REGARDING OUR INTEREST RATE SWAP.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS STRUCTURED INVESTMENT VEHICLES, OR SPECIAL PURPOSE OR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, ESTABLISHED TO FACILITATE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES. FURTHER, WE HAVE NOT GUARANTEED ANY OBLIGATIONS OF UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR ENTERED INTO ANY COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ANY SUCH ENTITIES.  DIVIDENDS  WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MAKE REGULAR QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK. U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAW GENERALLY REQUIRES THAT A REIT DISTRIBUTE ANNUALLY AT LEAST 90% OF OUR REIT TAXABLE INCOME, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DEDUCTION FOR DIVIDENDS PAID AND EXCLUDING NET CAPITAL GAINS, AND THAT WE PAY TAX AT REGULAR CORPORATE RATES TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ANNUALLY DISTRIBUTE LESS THAN 100% OF OUR NET TAXABLE INCOME. WE GENERALLY INTEND OVER TIME TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO OUR NET TAXABLE INCOME, IF AND TO THE EXTENT AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ANY DISTRIBUTIONS WE MAKE ARE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DEPEND UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE RESULTS AND OUR ABILITY TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE NET INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME FROM OUR PORTFOLIO, OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND ANY OTHER EXPENDITURES. IF OUR CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION IS LESS THAN OUR NET TAXABLE INCOME, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO SELL ASSETS OR BORROW FUNDS TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS OR WE MAY MAKE A PORTION OF THE REQUIRED DISTRIBUTION IN THE FORM OF A TAXABLE STOCK DISTRIBUTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF DEBT SECURITIES.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE HAD  6,770,393  SHARES OF SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK OUTSTANDING, WHICH ENTITLES HOLDERS TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS THAT ARE PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ARREARS. THE SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK PAY CUMULATIVE CASH DIVIDENDS, WHICH ARE PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN EQUAL AMOUNTS IN ARREARS ON THE 15TH DAY OF EACH JANUARY, APRIL, JULY AND OCTOBER: (I) FROM, AND INCLUDING, THE ORIGINAL DATE OF ISSUANCE OF THE SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK TO, BUT EXCLUDING, SEPTEMBER 20, 2020, AT AN INITIAL RATE OF 8.00% PER ANNUM OF THE $25.00 PER SHARE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE; AND (II) FROM, AND INCLUDING, SEPTEMBER 20, 2020, AT THE RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF (A) 8.00% AND (B) A FLOATING RATE EQUAL TO THE 3-MONTH LIBOR RATE AS CALCULATED ON EACH APPLICABLE DATE OF DETERMINATION PLUS 6.46% OF THE $25.00 LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE. EXCEPT UNDER CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, THE SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK IS GENERALLY NOT CONVERTIBLE INTO OR EXCHANGEABLE FOR ANY OTHER PROPERTY OR ANY OTHER OF OUR SECURITIES AT THE ELECTION OF THE HOLDERS. ON OR AFTER SEPTEMBER 21, 2020, WE MAY, AT OUR OPTION, REDEEM THE SHARES AT A REDEMPTION PRICE OF $25.00, PLUS ANY ACCRUED UNPAID DISTRIBUTION THROUGH THE DATE OF THE REDEMPTION.  ON JUNE 10, 2019, WE REDEEMED ALL 6,900,000 SHARES OF SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK OUTSTANDING. HOLDERS OF THE SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK RECEIVED THE REDEMPTION PRICE OF $25.00 PLUS ACCUMULATED BUT UNPAID DIVIDENDS TO THE REDEMPTION DATE OF  $0.2223.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  OPERATING EARNINGS  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , OUR OPERATING EARNINGS WERE  $56.6 MILLION  , OR  $0.38  PER SHARE, AND  $125.0 MILLION  , OR  $0.88  PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO  $54.9 MILLION  , OR  $0.44  PER SHARE, AND  $102.9 MILLION  , OR  $0.87  PER SHARE, FOR THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, RESPECTIVELY. OPERATING EARNINGS IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT WE DEFINE AS NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS, COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, ADJUSTED FOR (I) EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE (A PORTION OF WHICH MAY BECOME CASH-BASED UPON FINAL VESTING AND SETTLEMENT OF AWARDS SHOULD THE HOLDER ELECT NET SHARE SETTLEMENT TO SATISFY INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING), (II) ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES OR OTHER NON-CASH ITEMS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS, (III) UNREALIZED INCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES, (IV) FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS (LOSSES), OTHER THAN (A) REALIZED GAINS/(LOSSES) RELATED TO INTEREST INCOME, AND (B) FORWARD POINT GAINS/(LOSSES) REALIZED ON OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES, (V) THE NON-CASH AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF A PORTION OF THE NOTES TO STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AND (VI) PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES AND IMPAIRMENTS. BEGINNING WITH THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016, WE SLIGHTLY MODIFIED OUR DEFINITION OF OPERATING EARNINGS TO INCLUDE REALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) ON CURRENCY SWAPS RELATED TO INTEREST INCOME ON INVESTMENTS DENOMINATED IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS. IN ADDITION, BEGINNING WITH THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE FURTHER MODIFIED OUR DEFINITION OF OPERATING EARNINGS TO INCLUDE THE IMPACT FROM FORWARD POINTS ON OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES, WHICH REFLECT THE INTEREST RATE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN THE APPLICABLE BASE RATE FOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY INVESTMENTS AND USD LIBOR. THESE FORWARD CONTRACTS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT THE RATE EXPOSURE TO USD LIBOR, RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL INTEREST INCOME EARNED IN U.S. DOLLAR TERMS. THESE AMOUNTS ARE  33  NOT INCLUDED IN GAAP NET INCOME. IN ORDER TO CONFORM TO THE 2018 YEAR-END PRESENTATION, WHICH INCORPORATES THIS MODIFICATION, PRIOR-YEAR OPERATING EARNINGS RESULTS PRESENTED BELOW HAVE BEEN MODIFIED ACCORDINGLY. OPERATING EARNINGS MAY ALSO BE ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN OTHER NON-CASH ITEMS, AS DETERMINED BY THE MANAGER AND APPROVED BY A MAJORITY OF OUR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS.  THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING USED FOR OPERATING EARNINGS PER WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARE HAS BEEN ADJUSTED FROM WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES UNDER GAAP TO EXCLUDE SHARES ISSUED FROM A POTENTIAL CONVERSION OF THE NOTES. CONSISTENT WITH THE TREATMENT OF OTHER UNREALIZED ADJUSTMENTS TO OPERATING EARNINGS, THESE POTENTIALLY ISSUABLE SHARES ARE EXCLUDED UNTIL A CONVERSION OCCURS, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A USEFUL PRESENTATION FOR INVESTORS. WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING SHARES ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH A POTENTIAL CONVERSION OF THE NOTES FROM OUR COMPUTATION OF OPERATING EARNINGS PER WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS FOR VARIOUS REASONS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: (I) CONVERSION OF NOTES TO SHARES REQUIRES BOTH THE HOLDER OF A NOTE TO ELECT TO CONVERT THE NOTE AND FOR US TO ELECT TO SETTLE THE CONVERSION IN THE FORM OF SHARES; (II) FUTURE CONVERSION DECISIONS BY NOTE HOLDERS WILL BE BASED ON OUR STOCK PRICE IN THE FUTURE, WHICH IS PRESENTLY NOT DETERMINABLE; (III) THE EXCLUSION OF SHARES ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH A POTENTIAL CONVERSION OF THE NOTES FROM THE COMPUTATION OF OPERATING EARNINGS PER WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARE IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW WE TREAT OTHER UNREALIZED ITEMS IN OUR COMPUTATION OF OPERATING EARNINGS PER WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARE; AND (IV) WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN EVALUATING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, INVESTORS AND POTENTIAL INVESTORS CONSIDER OUR OPERATING EARNINGS RELATIVE TO OUR ACTUAL DISTRIBUTIONS, WHICH ARE BASED ON SHARES OUTSTANDING AND NOT SHARES THAT MIGHT BE ISSUED IN THE FUTURE.

OPERATING EARNINGS ALLOWS US TO ISOLATE THE NET INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SWAPS IN ORDER TO MONITOR AND PROJECT OUR FULL COST OF BORROWINGS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTORS USE OPERATING EARNINGS, OR A COMPARABLE SUPPLEMENTAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE, TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR COMPANY AND OUR PEERS AND, AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE THAT THE DISCLOSURE OF OPERATING EARNINGS IS USEFUL TO OUR INVESTORS. FORWARD POINTS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT OUR FOREIGN RATE EXPOSURE TO USD LIBOR, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A BETTER REFLECTION OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND WE BELIEVE THE INCLUSION OF THE RESULTING GAIN OR LOSS IN OPERATING EARNINGS IS USEFUL TO OUR INVESTORS. WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL TO OUR INVESTORS TO PRESENT OPERATING EARNINGS EXCLUDING REALIZED LOSS ON INVESTMENTS TO REFLECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF EARNING INTEREST INCOME ON OUR INVESTMENTS NET OF BORROWING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.  34  A SIGNIFICANT LIMITATION ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING EARNINGS AS A MEASURE OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER ANY PERIOD IS THAT IT EXCLUDES UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) FROM INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR PRESENTATION OF OPERATING EARNINGS MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY-TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES, WHO MAY USE DIFFERENT CALCULATIONS. AS A RESULT, OPERATING EARNINGS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OUR GAAP NET INCOME AS A MEASURE OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR ANY MEASURE OF OUR LIQUIDITY UNDER GAAP.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE ACQUISITION OF REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING ACQUIRED TANGIBLE ASSETS (CONSISTING OF LAND, BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS) AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (CONSISTING OF ABOVE-MARKET AND BELOW-MARKET LEASES AND ACQUIRED IN-PLACE LEASES) AT THEIR FAIR VALUE (FOR ACQUISITIONS MEETING THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS) AND RELATIVE FAIR VALUE (FOR ACQUISITIONS NOT MEETING THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS).  ACQUIRED LEASE INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDE ABOVE-MARKET LEASES AND ACQUIRED IN-PLACE LEASES, AND ACQUIRED LEASE INTANGIBLE LIABILITIES REPRESENT BELOW-MARKET LEASES, IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TANGIBLE ASSETS OF AN ACQUIRED PROPERTY IS DETERMINED BY VALUING THE PROPERTY AS IF IT WERE VACANT, WHICH VALUE IS THEN ALLOCATED TO LAND, BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S DETERMINATION OF THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS.  IN VALUING AN ACQUIRED PROPERTY\u2019S INTANGIBLES, FACTORS CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF CARRYING COSTS DURING THE EXPECTED LEASE-UP PERIODS, AND ESTIMATES OF LOST RENTAL REVENUE DURING THE EXPECTED LEASE-UP PERIODS BASED ON ITS EVALUATION OF CURRENT MARKET DEMAND.  MANAGEMENT ALSO ESTIMATES COSTS TO EXECUTE SIMILAR LEASES, INCLUDING LEASING COMMISSIONS, TENANT IMPROVEMENTS, LEGAL AND OTHER RELATED COSTS.  THE VALUE OF IN-PLACE LEASES IS MEASURED BY THE EXCESS OF (I) THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR A PROPERTY AFTER ADJUSTING EXISTING IN-PLACE LEASES TO MARKET RENTAL RATES, OVER (II) THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTY AS IF VACANT.  ABOVE-MARKET AND BELOW-MARKET LEASE VALUES ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE (USING A DISCOUNT RATE WHICH REFLECTS THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES ACQUIRED) OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS TO BE RECEIVED AND MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATE OF MARKET LEASE RATES, MEASURED OVER THE TERMS OF THE RESPECTIVE LEASES THAT MANAGEMENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION.  SUCH VALUATIONS INCLUDE A CONSIDERATION OF THE NON-CANCELLABLE TERMS OF THE RESPECTIVE LEASES AS WELL AS ANY APPLICABLE RENEWAL PERIODS.  THE FAIR VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH BELOW-MARKET RENTAL RENEWAL OPTIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPERIENCE AND THE RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXISTED AT THE TIME OF THE ACQUISITIONS.  THE VALUE OF THE ABOVE-MARKET AND BELOW-MARKET LEASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ORIGINAL LEASE TERM IS AMORTIZED TO RENTAL INCOME, OVER THE TERMS OF THE RESPECTIVE LEASES. THE VALUE OF IN-PLACE LEASES ARE AMORTIZED TO EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING NON-CANCELLABLE TERMS OF THE RESPECTIVE LEASES.  IF A LEASE WERE TO BE TERMINATED PRIOR TO ITS STATED EXPIRATION, ALL UNAMORTIZED AMOUNTS RELATING TO THAT LEASE WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN OPERATIONS AT THAT TIME.  THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO MAKE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENTS AS TO THE USEFUL LIFE OF ITS PROPERTIES FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF DEPRECIATION. THESE ASSESSMENTS HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S NET INCOME.  PROPERTIES ARE DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS.  BUILDINGS (YEARS)  39  \u2014  40  BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS (YEARS)  10  \u2014  20  FURNITURE/FIXTURES (YEARS)  3  \u2014  10  TENANT IMPROVEMENTS  SHORTER OF LEASE TERM OR THEIR USEFUL LIFE  -  36  -  ASSET IMPAIRMENT  THE COMPANY REVIEWS LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED IS MEASURED BY A COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET TO AGGREGATE FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS (UNDISCOUNTED AND WITHOUT INTEREST) EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSET. IF SUCH ASSETS ARE CONSIDERED IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF THE ASSETS EXCEED THE FAIR VALUE. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE VALUE OF ANY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS WAS IMPAIRED AT  JUNE 30, 2019.  REIT QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS  THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED AND QUALIFIED TO BE TAXED AS A REIT UNDER THE CODE, AND BELIEVES THAT IT HAS BEEN ORGANIZED AND HAS OPERATED IN A MANNER THAT WILL ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE TO QUALIFY FOR TAXATION AS A REIT UNDER THE CODE.  THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY AND THEN MAINTAIN QUALIFICATION AS A REIT.  IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A REIT, ITS INCOME WOULD BECOME SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES AT REGULAR CORPORATE RATES THAT WOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL AND ROIC MAY NOT BE PERMITTED TO RE-ELECT TO QUALIFY AS A REIT FOR FOUR TAXABLE YEARS FOLLOWING THE YEAR THAT IT FAILED TO QUALIFY AS A REIT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY AND AMOUNTS DISTRIBUTABLE TO STOCKHOLDERS WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IF IT FAILED TO QUALIFY AS A REIT.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY  IN THIS \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY\u201d SECTION AND IN THE \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u201d SECTION, THE TERM \u201cTHE COMPANY\u201d REFERS TO RETAIL OPPORTUNITY INVESTMENTS CORP. ON AN UNCONSOLIDATED BASIS, EXCLUDING THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS IS OPERATED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, OF WHICH THE COMPANY IS THE PARENT COMPANY AND WHICH IT CONSOLIDATES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. BECAUSE THE COMPANY OPERATES ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS WITH THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u201d SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS SECTION TO UNDERSTAND THE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AND HOW THE COMPANY IS OPERATED AS A WHOLE.  THE COMPANY ISSUES PUBLIC EQUITY FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT DOES NOT OTHERWISE GENERATE ANY CAPITAL ITSELF OR CONDUCT ANY BUSINESS ITSELF, OTHER THAN INCURRING CERTAIN EXPENSES IN OPERATING AS A PUBLIC COMPANY. THE COMPANY ITSELF DOES NOT HOLD ANY INDEBTEDNESS OTHER THAN GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, AND ITS ONLY MATERIAL ASSETS ARE ITS OWNERSHIP OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN RETAIL OPPORTUNITY INVESTMENTS GP, LLC, THE SOLE GENERAL PARTNER OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. THEREFORE, THE CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF THE COMPANY AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP ARE THE SAME ON THEIR RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. HOWEVER, ALL DEBT IS HELD DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. THE COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL FUNDING REQUIREMENT IS THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK. THE COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ITS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IS DISTRIBUTIONS IT RECEIVES FROM THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  AS THE PARENT COMPANY OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, THE COMPANY, INDIRECTLY, HAS THE FULL, EXCLUSIVE AND COMPLETE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL. THE COMPANY CAUSES THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO DISTRIBUTE SUCH PORTION OF ITS AVAILABLE CASH AS THE COMPANY MAY IN ITS DISCRETION DETERMINE, IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT.  THE COMPANY IS A WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER WITH AN EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED IN MAY 2019 THAT ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO REGISTER UNSPECIFIED VARIOUS CLASSES OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE EQUITY FROM TIME TO TIME ON AN OPPORTUNISTIC BASIS, DEPENDENT UPON MARKET CONDITIONS AND AVAILABLE PRICING. ANY PROCEEDS FROM SUCH EQUITY ISSUANCES WOULD BE CONTRIBUTED TO THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP MAY USE THE PROCEEDS TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES, PAY DOWN DEBT, AND FOR GENERAL WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES.  LIQUIDITY IS A MEASURE OF THE ABILITY TO MEET POTENTIAL CASH REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING ONGOING COMMITMENTS TO REPAY BORROWINGS, FUND AND MAINTAIN ITS ASSETS AND OPERATIONS, MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND MEET OTHER GENERAL BUSINESS NEEDS.  THE LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S ABILITY TO MAKE SUFFICIENT DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY. THE PRIMARY CASH REQUIREMENT OF THE COMPANY IS ITS PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS.  -  37  -  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S PRIMARY SOURCE OF CASH WAS DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT IT HAS ADEQUATE WORKING CAPITAL TO MEET ITS DIVIDEND FUNDING OBLIGATIONS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  ON MAY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO  FIVE  SEPARATE SALES AGREEMENTS (THE \u201cSALES AGREEMENTS\u201d) WITH EACH OF CAPITAL ONE SECURITIES, INC.,  JEFFERIES LLC, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS INC., RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, INC., AND ROBERT W.

DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S PRIMARY SOURCE OF CASH WAS  CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS DETERMINED THAT IT HAS ADEQUATE WORKING CAPITAL TO MEET ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2015, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A TERM LOAN AGREEMENT. EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 8, 2017, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED TERM LOAN AGREEMENT (THE \u201cTERM LOAN AGREEMENT\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH THE MATURITY DATE OF THE TERM LOAN WAS EXTENDED FROM JANUARY 31, 2019 TO SEPTEMBER 8, 2022, WITHOUT FURTHER OPTIONS FOR EXTENSION.

THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS AN UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH SEVERAL BANKS. EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 8, 2017, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS INCREASED FROM $500.0 MILLION TO $600.0 MILLION. THE MATURITY DATE OF THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS EXTENDED FROM JANUARY 31, 2019 TO SEPTEMBER 8, 2021, WITH TWO SIX-MONTH EXTENSION OPTIONS, WHICH MAY BE EXERCISED BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UPON SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS INCLUDING THE PAYMENT OF EXTENSION FEES. ADDITIONALLY, THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS AN ACCORDION FEATURE, WHICH ALLOWS THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO INCREASE THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY UP TO AN AGGREGATE OF $1.2 BILLION, SUBJECT TO LENDER CONSENTS AND OTHER CONDITIONS. BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY ACCRUE INTEREST ON THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT AT A RATE EQUAL TO AN APPLICABLE RATE BASED ON THE CREDIT RATING LEVEL OF THE COMPANY, PLUS, AS APPLICABLE, (I) THE EURODOLLAR RATE, OR (II) A BASE RATE DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO THE HIGHEST OF (A) THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE PLUS 0.50%, (B) THE RATE OF INTEREST ANNOUNCED BY KEYBANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AS ITS \u201cPRIME RATE,\u201d AND (C) THE EURODOLLAR RATE PLUS 1.00%.

WHILE THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP GENERALLY INTENDS TO HOLD ITS ASSETS AS LONG TERM INVESTMENTS, CERTAIN OF ITS INVESTMENTS MAY BE SOLD IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S INTEREST RATE RISK AND LIQUIDITY NEEDS, MEET OTHER OPERATING OBJECTIVES AND ADAPT TO MARKET CONDITIONS.  THE TIMING AND IMPACT OF FUTURE SALES OF ITS INVESTMENTS, IF ANY, CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH ANY CERTAINTY.

(2)  FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE ABOVE TABLE, THE COMPANY HAS ASSUMED THAT BORROWINGS UNDER THE TERM LOAN ACCRUE INTEREST AT THE INTEREST RATE ON THE TERM LOAN AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  WHICH WAS  3.5%.  (3)  FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE ABOVE TABLE, THE COMPANY HAS ASSUMED THAT BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY ACCRUE INTEREST AT THE INTEREST RATE ON THE CREDIT FACILITY AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  WHICH WAS  3.4%.

AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY CAPITAL LEASE OR PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS.  THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO SEVERAL LEASE AGREEMENTS WITH AN OFFICER OF THE COMPANY. PURSUANT TO THE LEASE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY IS PROVIDED THE USE OF STORAGE SPACE.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  REAL ESTATE TAXES  THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASES GENERALLY REQUIRE THE TENANTS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A PRO RATA PORTION OF THE REAL ESTATE TAXES.  INFLATION  THE COMPANY\u2019S LONG-TERM LEASES CONTAIN PROVISIONS TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON ITS OPERATING RESULTS.  SUCH PROVISIONS INCLUDE CLAUSES ENTITLING THE COMPANY TO RECEIVE (A) SCHEDULED BASE RENT INCREASES AND (B) PERCENTAGE RENTS BASED UPON TENANTS\u2019 GROSS SALES WHICH GENERALLY INCREASE AS PRICES RISE.  IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S NON-ANCHOR LEASES ARE FOR TERMS OF LESS THAN TEN YEARS, WHICH PERMITS THE COMPANY TO SEEK INCREASES IN RENTS UPON RENEWAL AT THEN-CURRENT MARKET RATES IF RENTS PROVIDED IN THE EXPIRING LEASES ARE BELOW THEN-EXISTING MARKET RATES.  MOST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASES REQUIRE TENANTS TO PAY A SHARE OF OPERATING EXPENSES, INCLUDING COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE, REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE AND UTILITIES, THEREBY REDUCING THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPOSURE TO INCREASES IN COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES RESULTING FROM INFLATION.  -  40  -  LEVERAGE POLICIES  THE COMPANY EMPLOYS PRUDENT AMOUNTS OF LEVERAGE AND USES DEBT AS A MEANS OF PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF ITS PROPERTIES AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF ITS PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANY SEEKS TO PRIMARILY UTILIZE UNSECURED DEBT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY AND FLEXIBILITY IN ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE.  ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2015, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A TERM LOAN AGREEMENT. EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 8, 2017, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED TERM LOAN AGREEMENT (THE \u201cTERM LOAN AGREEMENT\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH THE MATURITY DATE OF THE TERM LOAN WAS EXTENDED FROM JANUARY 31, 2019 TO SEPTEMBER 8, 2022, WITHOUT FURTHER OPTIONS FOR EXTENSION. THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDES THAT THE COMPANY MAY FROM TIME TO TIME REQUEST INCREASED AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS OF $200.0 MILLION UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE CONSENT OF THE LENDERS FOR THE ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS. THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS AN UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH SEVERAL BANKS. EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 8, 2017, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS INCREASED FROM $500.0 MILLION TO $600.0 MILLION. THE MATURITY DATE OF THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS EXTENDED FROM JANUARY 31, 2019 TO SEPTEMBER 8, 2021, WITH TWO SIX-MONTH EXTENSION OPTIONS, WHICH MAY BE EXERCISED BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UPON SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS INCLUDING THE PAYMENT OF EXTENSION FEES. ADDITIONALLY, THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS AN ACCORDION FEATURE, WHICH ALLOWS THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO INCREASE THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY UP TO AN AGGREGATE OF $1.2 BILLION, SUBJECT TO LENDER CONSENTS AND OTHER CONDITIONS.  FURTHER, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP ISSUED $250.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES IN EACH OF DECEMBER 2017, DECEMBER 2014 AND DECEMBER 2013 AND $200.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES IN SEPTEMBER 2016, EACH OF WHICH WERE FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE ROIC.  THE COMPANY MAY BORROW ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS OR AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL OR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP LEVEL. NON-RECOURSE INDEBTEDNESS MEANS THE INDEBTEDNESS OF THE BORROWER OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS SECURED ONLY BY SPECIFIC ASSETS WITHOUT RECOURSE TO OTHER ASSETS OF THE BORROWER OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES. EVEN WITH NON-RECOURSE INDEBTEDNESS, HOWEVER, A BORROWER OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE AGAINST CERTAIN BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SUCH AS THOSE RELATING TO THE ABSENCE OF FRAUD, MISAPPROPRIATION, MISAPPLICATION OF FUNDS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATIONS. BECAUSE NON-RECOURSE FINANCING GENERALLY RESTRICTS THE LENDER\u2019S CLAIM ON THE ASSETS OF THE BORROWER, THE LENDER GENERALLY MAY ONLY PROCEED AGAINST THE ASSET SECURING THE DEBT. THIS MAY PROTECT THE COMPANY\u2019S OTHER ASSETS.  THE COMPANY PLANS TO EVALUATE EACH INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY AND DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE LEVERAGE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS AND ALSO ON A COMPANY-WIDE BASIS. THE COMPANY MAY SEEK TO REFINANCE INDEBTEDNESS, SUCH AS WHEN A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES MAKES IT BENEFICIAL TO PREPAY AN EXISTING MORTGAGE, WHEN AN EXISTING MORTGAGE MATURES OR IF AN ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT BECOMES AVAILABLE AND THE PROCEEDS FROM THE REFINANCING CAN BE USED TO PURCHASE THE INVESTMENT.  THE COMPANY PLANS TO FINANCE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS, BORROWINGS UNDER ITS CREDIT FACILITY, THE ASSUMPTION OF EXISTING MORTGAGE DEBT, THE ISSUANCE OF OP UNITS, AND EQUITY AND DEBT OFFERINGS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY ACQUIRE RETAIL PROPERTIES INDIRECTLY THROUGH JOINT VENTURES WITH THIRD PARTIES AS A MEANS OF INCREASING THE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES.  DISTRIBUTIONS  THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND ROIC INTEND TO MAKE REGULAR QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS TO HOLDERS OF THEIR OP UNITS AND COMMON STOCK, RESPECTIVELY.  THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP PAYS DISTRIBUTIONS TO ROIC DIRECTLY AS A HOLDER OF UNITS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, AND INDIRECTLY TO ROIC THROUGH DISTRIBUTIONS TO RETAIL OPPORTUNITY INVESTMENTS GP, LLC, A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF ROIC.  U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAW GENERALLY REQUIRES THAT A REIT DISTRIBUTE ANNUALLY AT LEAST 90% OF ITS REIT TAXABLE INCOME, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DEDUCTION FOR DIVIDENDS PAID AND EXCLUDING NET CAPITAL GAINS, AND THAT IT PAY U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX AT REGULAR CORPORATE RATES TO THE EXTENT THAT IT ANNUALLY DISTRIBUTES LESS THAN 100% OF ITS NET TAXABLE INCOME.

THIS SECTION CONTAINS BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON OUR COMPANY AND THE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS THAT WE PROVIDE, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS, OUR ENTERPRISE PRIORITIES, AND THE TRENDS AFFECTING OUR INDUSTRY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u2022  CHANGES IN CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES.  THIS SECTION CONTAINS A DISCUSSION OF CHANGES SINCE OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  IN THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THAT REQUIRE JUDGMENT AND ESTIMATES ON THE PART OF MANAGEMENT IN THEIR APPLICATION.  \u2022  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THIS SECTION CONTAINS AN ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PRESENTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME BY COMPARING THE RESULTS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  TO THE COMPARABLE PERIODS IN  2018.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.  THIS SECTION PROVIDES AN ANALYSIS OF OUR CASH FLOWS AND A DISCUSSION OF OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019.  OVERVIEW  COMPANY BACKGROUND  WE ARE A LEADING GLOBAL PROVIDER OF FINANCIAL SERVICES TECHNOLOGY. WE PROVIDE ACCOUNT PROCESSING SYSTEMS, ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS PROCESSING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INTERNET AND MOBILE BANKING SYSTEMS, AND RELATED SERVICES. WE SERVE OVER 12,000 CLIENTS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING BANKS, CREDIT UNIONS, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRMS, LEASING AND FINANCE COMPANIES, BILLERS, RETAILERS, AND MERCHANTS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM RECURRING ACCOUNT- AND TRANSACTION-BASED FEES UNDER CONTRACTS THAT GENERALLY HAVE TERMS OF THREE TO FIVE YEARS AND HIGH RENEWAL RATES. MOST OF THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE ARE NECESSARY FOR OUR CLIENTS TO OPERATE THEIR BUSINESSES AND ARE, THEREFORE, NON-DISCRETIONARY IN NATURE.  OUR OPERATIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND ARE COMPRISED OF THE PAYMENTS AND INDUSTRY PRODUCTS (\u201cPAYMENTS\u201d) SEGMENT AND THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SERVICES (\u201cFINANCIAL\u201d) SEGMENT. THE PAYMENTS SEGMENT PRIMARILY PROVIDES ELECTRONIC BILL PAYMENT AND PRESENTMENT SERVICES, INTERNET AND MOBILE BANKING SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, ACCOUNT-TO-ACCOUNT TRANSFERS, PERSON-TO-PERSON PAYMENT SERVICES, DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD PROCESSING AND SERVICES, PAYMENTS INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES, AND OTHER ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS SOFTWARE AND SERVICES. OUR BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT ALSO PROVIDE CARD AND PRINT PERSONALIZATION SERVICES, INVESTMENT ACCOUNT PROCESSING SERVICES FOR SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS, AND FRAUD AND RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE FINANCIAL SEGMENT PROVIDES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH ACCOUNT PROCESSING SERVICES, ITEM PROCESSING AND SOURCE CAPTURE SERVICES, LOAN ORIGINATION AND SERVICING PRODUCTS, CASH MANAGEMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES, AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT SUPPORT NUMEROUS TYPES OF FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. CORPORATE AND OTHER PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF INTERCOMPANY ELIMINATIONS, AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, UNALLOCATED CORPORATE EXPENSES AND OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED WHEN MANAGEMENT EVALUATES SEGMENT PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS GAINS ON SALES OF BUSINESSES AND ASSOCIATED TRANSITION SERVICES.  ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS  WE FREQUENTLY REVIEW OUR PORTFOLIO TO ENSURE WE HAVE THE RIGHT SET OF BUSINESSES TO EXECUTE ON OUR STRATEGY. WE EXPECT TO ACQUIRE BUSINESSES WHEN WE IDENTIFY: A COMPELLING STRATEGIC NEED, SUCH AS A PRODUCT, SERVICE OR TECHNOLOGY THAT HELPS MEET CLIENT DEMAND; AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE INDUSTRY DYNAMICS; A WAY TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS SCALE; OR SIMILAR CONSIDERATIONS. WE EXPECT TO DIVEST BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT IN LINE WITH OUR MARKET, PRODUCT OR FINANCIAL STRATEGIES.  ON OCTOBER 31, 2018, WE ACQUIRED THE DEBIT CARD PROCESSING, ATM MANAGED SERVICES, AND MONEY PASS  \u00ae  SURCHARGE-FREE NETWORK OF ELAN FINANCIAL SERVICES, A UNIT OF U.S. BANCORP, FOR APPROXIMATELY  $659 MILLION  , INCLUDING POST-CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS, ESTIMATED CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO EARN-OUT PROVISIONS AND FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER A TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT IN EXCESS OF ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. THIS ACQUISITION, INCLUDED WITHIN THE PAYMENTS SEGMENT, DEEPENS OUR PRESENCE IN DEBIT CARD PROCESSING, BROADENS OUR CLIENT REACH AND SCALE, AND PROVIDES NEW SOLUTIONS TO ENHANCE THE VALUE PROPOSITION FOR OUR EXISTING DEBIT SOLUTION CLIENTS.  ON JANUARY 16, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE MERGER AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE FIRST DATA CORPORATION (\u201cFIRST DATA\u201d) IN AN ALL-STOCK TRANSACTION FOR AN EQUITY VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY  $22 BILLION  AS OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT. FISERV AND FIRST DATA HAVE RECEIVED THE FINAL REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS AND NON-OBJECTIONS NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION. SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OR WAIVER OF THE REMAINING CUSTOMARY CONTRACTUAL CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES EXPECT TO CLOSE THE TRANSACTION ON OR ABOUT JULY 29, 2019. FIRST DATA IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN COMMERCE-ENABLING TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS FOR MERCHANTS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND CARD ISSUERS.  IN MARCH 2018, WE SOLD A 55% INTEREST OF OUR LENDING SOLUTIONS BUSINESS, WHICH WAS REPORTED WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SEGMENT, RETAINING 45% OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN TWO JOINT VENTURES (THE \u201cLENDING JOINT VENTURES\u201d). IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS TRANSACTION, WE ENTERED INTO TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE, AT FAIR VALUE, VARIOUS ADMINISTRATION, BUSINESS PROCESS OUTSOURCING, TECHNICAL AND DATA CENTER RELATED SERVICES FOR DEFINED PERIODS TO THE LENDING JOINT VENTURES. WE RECEIVED GROSS SALE PROCEEDS OF  $419 MILLION  FROM THE TRANSACTIONS.  ENTERPRISE PRIORITIES  WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT A SERIES OF STRATEGIC INITIATIVES TO MOVE MONEY AND INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT MOVES THE WORLD. THESE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES INCLUDE ACTIVE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT OF OUR BUSINESSES, ENHANCING THE OVERALL VALUE OF OUR EXISTING CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS, IMPROVING OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS, BEING DISCIPLINED IN OUR ALLOCATION OF CAPITAL, AND DIFFERENTIATING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH INNOVATION. OUR KEY ENTERPRISE PRIORITIES FOR  2019  ARE TO: (I) CONTINUE TO BUILD HIGH-QUALITY REVENUE WHILE MEETING OUR EARNINGS GOALS; (II) ENHANCE CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON DIGITAL AND PAYMENT SOLUTIONS;  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AND (III) DELIVER INNOVATION AND INTEGRATION WHICH ENABLES DIFFERENTIATED VALUE FOR OUR CLIENTS. WE ALSO EXPECT TO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO COMPLETING THE FIRST DATA MERGER AND, SUBJECT TO CLOSING, TO INTEGRATING FIRST DATA INTO OUR OPERATIONS.  INDUSTRY TRENDS  THE MARKET FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CONTINUES TO EVOLVE RAPIDLY. THE TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL INDUSTRY AND OTHER MARKET ENTRANTS REGULARLY INTRODUCE AND IMPLEMENT NEW PAYMENT, DEPOSIT, RISK MANAGEMENT, LENDING, AND INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, AND THE DISTINCTIONS AMONG THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TRADITIONALLY OFFERED BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CONTINUE TO NARROW AS THEY SEEK TO SERVE THE SAME CUSTOMERS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE EVOLVING REGULATORY AND CYBERSECURITY LANDSCAPE HAS CONTINUED TO CREATE A CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, LEGISLATION SUCH AS THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT HAS GENERATED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO GENERATE, NEW REGULATIONS IMPACTING THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY. THESE CONDITIONS ARE DRIVING HEIGHTENED INTEREST IN SOLUTIONS THAT HELP FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WIN AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS, GENERATE INCREMENTAL REVENUE, COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS AND ENHANCE OPERATING EFFICIENCY. EXAMPLES OF THESE SOLUTIONS INCLUDE ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS AND DELIVERY METHODS SUCH AS INTERNET, MOBILE AND TABLET BANKING, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS \u201cDIGITAL CHANNELS.\u201d  THE FOCUS ON DIGITAL CHANNELS BY BOTH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS THE GROWING VOLUME AND TYPES OF PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS IN THE MARKETPLACE, CONTINUES TO ELEVATE THE DATA AND TRANSACTION PROCESSING NEEDS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WE EXPECT THAT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS, MANAGE INFORMATION, MAINTAIN REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND OFFER INNOVATIVE NEW SERVICES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS IN THIS RAPIDLY EVOLVING AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL BENEFIT OVER THE LONG TERM FROM THE TREND OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MOVING FROM IN-HOUSE TECHNOLOGY TO OUTSOURCED SOLUTIONS AS THEY SEEK TO REMAIN CURRENT ON TECHNOLOGY CHANGES IN AN EVOLVING MARKETPLACE. WE BELIEVE THAT ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING THE INFRASTRUCTURE, TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND NETWORKS NECESSARY TO BE COMPETITIVE IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT ARE ESSENTIAL TO JUSTIFY THESE INVESTMENTS, AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS THAT FACILITATE CUSTOMER INTERACTION WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS THROUGH DIGITAL CHANNELS, WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE, WHICH WE EXPECT TO CREATE REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US.  IN ADDITION TO THE TRENDS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MARKETPLACE HAS EXPERIENCED CHANGE IN COMPOSITION AS WELL. DURING THE PAST 25 YEARS, THE NUMBER OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS DECLINED AT A RELATIVELY STEADY RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 3% PER YEAR, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF VOLUNTARY MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. RATHER THAN REDUCING THE OVERALL MARKET, THESE CONSOLIDATIONS HAVE TRANSFERRED ACCOUNTS AMONG FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IF A CLIENT LOSS OCCURS DUE TO MERGER OR ACQUISITION, WE RECEIVE A CONTRACT TERMINATION FEE BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE CLIENT AND HOW EARLY IN THE CONTRACT TERM THE CONTRACT IS TERMINATED. THESE FEES CAN VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. OUR REVENUE IS DIVERSIFIED, AND WE HAVE CLIENTS THAT SPAN THE ENTIRE RANGE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN TERMS OF ASSET SIZE AND BUSINESS MODEL, WITH OUR 50 LARGEST FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CLIENTS REPRESENTING LESS THAN 25% OF OUR ANNUAL REVENUE. OUR FOCUS ON LONG-TERM CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND RECURRING, TRANSACTION-ORIENTED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAS ALSO REDUCED THE IMPACT THAT CONSOLIDATION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS HAD ON US. WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTEGRATION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CREATES A COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITION FOR OUR CLIENTS BY PROVIDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, NEW SOURCES OF REVENUE AND OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE THEIR COSTS. FURTHERMORE, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SIZABLE AND DIVERSE CLIENT BASE, COMBINED WITH OUR POSITION AS A LEADING PROVIDER OF NON-DISCRETIONARY, RECURRING REVENUE-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, GIVES US A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH.  CHANGES IN CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES. IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE IDENTIFIED OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES THAT WE USE TO PREPARE OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING FOR RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, AND BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE IN LIGHT OF CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL AMOUNTS AND RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES. THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES FROM THOSE DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS CERTAIN AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, THE RELATIVE PERCENTAGE THAT THOSE AMOUNTS REPRESENT TO REVENUE AND THE CHANGE IN THOSE AMOUNTS FROM YEAR TO YEAR.

WE OPERATE PRIMARILY IN THE U.S. AND ARE THE NATION'S LARGEST SUPPLIER OF CONSTRUCTION AGGREGATES (PRIMARILY CRUSHED STONE, SAND AND GRAVEL) AND A MAJOR PRODUCER OF ASPHALT MIX AND READY-MIXED CONCRETE. OUR STRATEGY AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE ARE BASED ON OUR STRENGTH IN AGGREGATES. AGGREGATES ARE USED IN MOST TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION AND IN THE PRODUCTION OF ASPHALT MIX AND READY-MIXED CONCRETE.  DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS DEPENDENT ON CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY AND CORRELATES POSITIVELY WITH GROWTH IN POPULATION, HOUSEHOLD FORMATION AND EMPLOYMENT. END USES INCLUDE PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION (E.G., HIGHWAYS, BRIDGES, BUILDINGS, AIRPORTS, SCHOOLS, PRISONS, SEWER AND WASTE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS, WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS, DAMS AND RESERVOIRS), PRIVATE NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION (E.G., MANUFACTURING, RETAIL, OFFICES, INDUSTRIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL) AND PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION (E.G., SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES, DUPLEXES, APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND CONDOMINIUMS). CUSTOMERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE HEAVY CONSTRUCTION AND PAVING CONTRACTORS; COMMERCIAL BUILDING CONTRACTORS; CONCRETE PRODUCTS MANUFACTURERS; RESIDENTIAL BUILDING CONTRACTORS; RAILROADS AND ELECTRIC UTILITIES; AND TO A SMALLER EXTENT STATE, COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS.  AGGREGATES HAVE A HIGH WEIGHT-TO-VALUE RATIO AND, IN MOST CASES, MUST BE PRODUCED NEAR WHERE THEY ARE USED; IF NOT, TRANSPORTATION CAN COST MORE THAN THE MATERIALS, RENDERING THEM UNCOMPETITIVE COMPARED TO LOCALLY PRODUCED MATERIALS. EXCEPTIONS TO THIS TYPICAL MARKET STRUCTURE INCLUDE AREAS ALONG THE U.S. GULF COAST AND THE EASTERN SEABOARD WHERE THERE ARE LIMITED SUPPLIES OF LOCALLY AVAILABLE HIGH-QUALITY AGGREGATES. WE SERVE THESE MARKETS FROM QUARRIES THAT HAVE ACCESS TO COST-EFFECTIVE LONG-HAUL TRANSPORTATION \u2014 SHIPPING BY BARGE AND RAIL \u2014 AND FROM OUR QUARRY ON MEXICO'S YUCATAN PENINSULA WITH OUR FLEET OF PANAMAX-CLASS, SELF-UNLOADING SHIPS.  THERE ARE LIMITED SUBSTITUTES FOR QUALITY AGGREGATES. BECAUSE OF BARRIERS TO ENTRY CREATED IN MANY METROPOLITAN MARKETS BY ZONING AND PERMITTING REGULATION AND BECAUSE OF HIGH TRANSPORTATION COSTS RELATIVE TO THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCT, THE LOCATION OF RESERVES IS A CRITICAL FACTOR TO OUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS.  NO MATERIAL PART OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON ANY SINGLE CUSTOMER WHOSE LOSS WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. IN 2018, OUR FIVE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 8% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES (EXCLUDING INTERNAL SALES), AND NO SINGLE CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 2%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES. ALTHOUGH APPROXIMATELY 45% TO 55% OF OUR AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN USED IN PUBLICLY FUNDED CONSTRUCTION, SUCH AS HIGHWAYS, AIRPORTS AND GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS, RELATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT SALES ARE MADE DIRECTLY TO FEDERAL, STATE, COUNTY OR MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS/AGENCIES. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH REDUCTIONS IN STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING CAN CURTAIL PUBLICLY FUNDED CONSTRUCTION, OUR BUSINESS IS NOT DIRECTLY SUBJECT TO RENEGOTIATION OF PROFITS OR TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS WITH STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS.  WHILE AGGREGATES IS OUR FOCUS AND PRIMARY BUSINESS, WE BELIEVE VERTICAL INTEGRATION BETWEEN AGGREGATES AND DOWNSTREAM PRODUCTS, SUCH AS ASPHALT MIX AND READY-MIXED CONCRETE, CAN BE MANAGED EFFECTIVELY IN CERTAIN MARKETS GENERATING ACCEPTABLE FINANCIAL RETURNS AND ENHANCING FINANCIAL RETURNS IN OUR CORE AGGREGATES SEGMENT. WE PRODUCE AND SELL ASPHALT MIX AND/OR READY-MIXED CONCRETE PRIMARILY IN OUR ALABAMA, MID-ATLANTIC, SOUTHWESTERN, TENNESSEE AND WESTERN MARKETS. AGGREGATES COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 95% OF ASPHALT MIX BY WEIGHT AND 80% OF READY-MIXED CONCRETE BY WEIGHT. IN BOTH OF THESE DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES, AGGREGATES ARE PRIMARILY SUPPLIED FROM OUR OPERATIONS.  SEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS  ALMOST ALL OUR PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED AND CONSUMED OUTDOORS. SEASONAL CHANGES AND OTHER WEATHER-RELATED CONDITIONS CAN AFFECT THE PRODUCTION AND SALES VOLUME OF OUR PRODUCTS. THEREFORE, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR ANY QUARTER DO NOT NECESSARILY INDICATE THE RESULTS EXPECTED FOR THE YEAR. NORMALLY, THE HIGHEST SALES AND EARNINGS ARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND THE LOWEST ARE IN THE FIRST QUARTER. FURTHERMORE, OUR SALES AND EARNINGS ARE SENSITIVE TO NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, DEMOGRAPHIC AND POPULATION FLUCTUATIONS, AND PARTICULARLY TO CYCLICAL SWINGS IN CONSTRUCTION SPENDING, PRIMARILY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.  \u200e  27  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR SECOND QUARTER 2019  COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER 2018.  \u200e  \uf0a7  TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED $127.5 MILLION, OR 11%, TO $1,327.7 MILLION  \uf0a7  GROSS PROFIT INCREASED $47.3 MILLION, OR 15%, TO $370.5 MILLION  \uf0a7  AGGREGATES SEGMENT SALES INCREASED $105.8 MILLION, OR 11%, TO $1,062.1 MILLION  \uf0a7  AGGREGATES SEGMENT FREIGHT-ADJUSTED REVENUES INCREASED $75.9 MILLION, OR 10%, TO $806.4 MILLION  \uf0a7  SHIPMENTS INCREASED 4%, OR 2.4 MILLION TONS, TO 57.3 MILLION TONS  \uf0a7  SAME-STORE SHIPMENTS INCREASED 3%, OR 1.7 MILLION TONS, TO 56.7 MILLION TONS  \uf0a7  FREIGHT-ADJUSTED SALES PRICE INCREASED 5.9%, OR $0.78 PER TON  \uf0a7  SAME-STORE FREIGHT-ADJUSTED SALES PRICE INCREASED 5.7%, OR $0.76 PER TON  \uf0a7  SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT INCREASED $45.7 MILLION, OR 16%, TO $329.2 MILLION  \uf0a7  ASPHALT, CONCRETE AND CALCIUM SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT INCREASED $1.6 MILLION, OR 4%, TO $41.3 MILLION, COLLECTIVELY  \uf0a7  SELLING, ADMINISTRATIVE AND GENERAL (SAG) EXPENSES INCREASED $6.6 MILLION AND DECREASED 0.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS (200 BASIS POINTS) AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES  \uf0a7  OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED $45.8 MILLION, OR 20%, TO $276.1 MILLION  \uf0a7  EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $197.9 MILLION, OR $1.48 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO $160.3 MILLION, OR $1.20 PER DILUTED SHARE  \uf0a7  ADJUSTED EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $1.48 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO $1.23 PER DILUTED SHARE  \uf0a7  NET EARNINGS WERE $197.6 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $37.9 MILLION, OR 24%  \uf0a7  ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS $372.0 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $47.2 MILLION, OR 15%  \uf0a7  RETURNED CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS VIA DIVIDENDS ($41.0 MILLION @ $0.31 PER SHARE VERSUS $37.0 MILLION @ $0.28 PER SHARE) AND SHARE REPURCHASES (NONE IN 2019 VERSUS $19.4 MILLION @ AN AVERAGE OF $113.29 PER SHARE)  NET EARNINGS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WERE $197.6 MILLION, UP 24%, AND ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS $372.0 MILLION, UP 15%, COMPARED TO LAST YEAR\u2019S SECOND QUARTER. THE DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A 16% INCREASE IN AGGREGATES SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT. FOR THE QUARTER, AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS INCREASED 4% YEAR-OVER-YEAR, AND FREIGHT-ADJUSTED AGGREGATES PRICING INCREASED 5.9% (5.4% MIX-ADJUSTED). SAME-STORE AGGREGATES GROSS PROFIT INCREMENTAL FLOW-THROUGH RATE FOR THE TRAILING-TWELVE MONTHS WAS 65%.  WE CONTINUED TO EXECUTE WELL. OUR INDUSTRY-LEADING UNIT PROFITABILITY IN AGGREGATES INCREASED FROM $5.16 TO $5.74 PER TON, AN 11% INCREASE COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S SECOND QUARTER. WE REMAIN KEENLY FOCUSED ON CREATING LONG-TERM VALUE BY COMPOUNDING OUR AGGREGATES UNIT MARGINS, WHILE CONTINUING TO OPERATE SAFELY. SHIPMENT GROWTH IN THE SECOND QUARTER WAS SOLID AND CONSISTENT WITH FULL-YEAR EXPECTATIONS. IMPORTANTLY, PRICE IMPROVEMENTS WERE WIDESPREAD. THESE RESULTS FURTHER HIGHLIGHT THE STRENGTH OF OUR AGGREGATES-FOCUSED BUSINESS, WHICH SERVES OUR ATTRACTIVE, LONG-TERM GROWTH MARKETS.  OUR KEY MARKETS ARE BENEFITTING FROM ROBUST GROWTH IN PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION DEMAND, DRIVEN BY HIGHWAYS. STATE-LEVEL TRANSPORTATION FUNDING INCREASES SIGNED INTO LAW IN RECENT YEARS HAVE LED TO NEW HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION STARTS THAT ARE 21% HIGHER THAN TWO YEARS AGO. THIS SIGNIFICANT INCREASE WILL SUPPORT CONTINUED SHIPMENT GROWTH INTO TRANSPORTATION-RELATED END MARKETS IN THE COMING YEARS. SHIPMENTS INTO PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION CONTINUE TO GROW AS WELL. AGGREGATES PRICING MOMENTUM CONTINUES TO IMPROVE,  CONSISTENT WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS. THE CONTINUING IMPROVEMENT IN UNIT PROFITABILITY IS A DIRECT RESULT OF OUR FOCUS ON OPERATING DISCIPLINES AND COMPOUNDING PRICING IMPROVEMENTS.  C  APITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE SECOND QUARTER WERE $103.8 MILLION. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDED $63.8 MILLION OF CORE OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE CAPITAL TO IMPROVE OR REPLACE EXISTING PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT. IN ADDITION, WE INVESTED $40.0 MILLION IN INTERNAL GROWTH PROJECTS TO SECURE NEW AGGREGATES RESERVES, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTION SITES, ENHANCE OUR DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES AND SUPPORT THE TARGETED GROWTH OF OUR ASPHALT OPERATIONS. THROUGH THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALED $225.8 MILLION ($131.2 MILLION MAINTENANCE CAPITAL AND $94.6 MILLION INTERNAL GROWTH CAPITAL). OUR FULL-YEAR EXPECTATIONS FOR 2019 REMAIN UNCHANGED AT $250 MILLION ON MAINTENANCE CAPITAL AND $200 MILLION ON INTERNAL GROWTH PROJECTS.  28  DURING THE QUARTER, WE RETURNED $41.0 MILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS, AN 11% INCREASE VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. NO SHARES WERE REPURCHASED DURING THE QUARTER. AT QUARTER-END, TOTAL DEBT WAS $2.9 BILLION, OR 2.4 TIMES TRAILING-TWELVE MONTH ADJUSTED EBITDA.  OVERALL DEMAND GROWTH IN OUR MARKETS REMAIN HEALTHY. PUBLIC DEMAND GROWTH, LED BY HIGHWAYS, CONTINUES TO BE ROBUST ACROSS OUR FOOTPRINT. SHIPMENTS INTO PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION END MARKETS CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THE ONGOING ECONOMIC RECOVERY. DEMAND FUNDAMENTALS, INCLUDING POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT GROWTH, UNDERPIN LONG-TERM GROWTH IN RESIDENTIAL AND PRIVATE NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. WE DELIVERED GOOD INCREMENTAL EARNINGS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR. UNIT PROFITABILITY IN AGGREGATES INCREASED 11% THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF 2019, AND WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO CARRY THAT MOMENTUM FORWARD THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. FOR THE FULL YEAR, WE EXPECT EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF BETWEEN $4.55 AND $5.05 PER DILUTED SHARE AND ADJUSTED EBITDA OF BETWEEN $1.250 BILLION AND $1.330 BILLION.  29  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  TOTAL REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM OUR PRODUCT SALES OF AGGREGATES, ASPHALT MIX AND READY-MIXED CONCRETE, AND INCLUDE FREIGHT & DELIVERY COSTS THAT WE PASS ALONG TO OUR CUSTOMERS TO DELIVER THESE PRODUCTS. WE ALSO GENERATE SERVICE REVENUES FROM OUR ASPHALT CONSTRUCTION PAVING BUSINESS AND SERVICES RELATED TO OUR AGGREGATES BUSINESS.

SECOND QUARTER AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS INCREASED 4% (3% ON A SAME-STORE BASIS) VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE SOLID UNDERLYING DEMAND FUNDAMENTALS OF INCREASED PUBLIC FUNDING FOR HIGHWAYS, ALONG WITH EMPLOYMENT AND POPULATION GROWTH, HELPED DRIVE SHIPMENT STRENGTH ACROSS MOST OF OUR FOOTPRINT, PARTICULARLY IN THE MID-ATLANTIC AND SOUTHEAST. WET WEATHER DELAYED SHIPMENTS ACROSS ILLINOIS, TENNESSEE AND TEXAS. CALIFORNIA OVERCAME ANOTHER QUARTER OF WET WEATHER TO REALIZE SHIPMENT GROWTH COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. A HEALTHY DEMAND ENVIRONMENT, LED BY TRANSPORTATION-RELATED CONSTRUCTION, IS DRIVING VOLUME GROWTH AND PRICE IMPROVEMENT.  ALL OF OUR KEY MARKETS REPORTED YEAR-OVER-YEAR PRICE GROWTH. FOR THE QUARTER, FREIGHT-ADJUSTED AVERAGE SALES PRICE FOR AGGREGATES INCREASED 5.9% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER. FAVORABLE MIX ADDED 0.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS (50 BASIS POINTS) TO OVERALL GROWTH.

ASPHALT SHIPMENTS INCREASED 8% (5% SAME-STORE), AND ASPHALT MIX SELLING PRICES INCREASED 8%, OR $4.34 PER TON, IN THE SECOND QUARTER. THE AVERAGE UNIT COST FOR LIQUID ASPHALT WAS 16% HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. LIQUID ASPHALT COSTS HAVE REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR AND HAVE ALLOWED PRICING GAINS TO BEGIN OFFSETTING THE HIGHER UNIT COSTS FOR LIQUID ASPHALT.  CONCRETE SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT WAS $12.9 MILLION, A 2% DECREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. SHIPMENTS WERE 0.8 MILLION CUBIC YARDS, DOWN FROM 0.9 MILLION CUBIC YARDS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. AVERAGE SALES PRICE INCREASED 5% AND LED TO MODEST GAINS IN MATERIAL MARGINS.  CALCIUM SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT WAS $0.8 MILLION, A SLIGHT INCREASE VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  SAG EXPENSES WERE $95.7 MILLION VERSUS $89.0 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S SECOND QUARTER.  THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE WAS DUE MAINLY TO COMPENSATION RELATED EXPENSE, INCLUDING INCENTIVES THAT ARE TIED TO EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS AND THE SHARE PRICE. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE MADE INVESTMENTS IN PEOPLE AND PROCESSES TO ACCELERATE THE BENEFITS DERIVED FROM OUR SALES AND OPERATIONAL INITIATIVES. ON A TRAILING-TWELVE MONTH BASIS, SAG EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES WAS 7.6%, 0.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS (30 BASIS POINTS) LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.

THE INCREASE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS LARGELY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN EARNINGS ALONG WITH A DECREASE IN SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXCESS TAX BENEFITS AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $1.97 PER DILUTED SHARE IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 COMPARED TO $1.59 PER DILUTED SHARE IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  \u2014 YEAR-TO-DATE JUNE PRETAX LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $1.3 MILLION IN 2019 COMPARED WITH PRETAX LOSS OF $1.4 MILLION IN YEAR-TO-DATE JUNE 2018. BOTH PERIODS INCLUDE CHARGES RELATED TO GENERAL AND PRODUCT LIABILITY COSTS, INCLUDING LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FORMER CHEMICALS BUSINESS.

A SUMMARY OF THESE POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 (FORM 10-K).  WE PREPARE THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO CONFORM WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE PRINCIPLES REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT OUR REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT CONDITIONS AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS WE BELIEVE REASONABLE UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES AND EVALUATE THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THE RESULTS OF THESE ESTIMATES FORM THE BASIS FOR OUR JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS WELL AS IDENTIFYING AND ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT WITH RESPECT TO COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED IN THE \u201cMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d SECTION OF OUR FORM 10-K REQUIRE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SO WE CONSIDER THESE TO BE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED GAAP MEASURES, AND OTHER COMPANIES MAY DEFINE SUCH MEASURES DIFFERENTLY. WE ENCOURAGE INVESTORS TO REVIEW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RECONCILIATION OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THEIR ENTIRETY AND NOT TO RELY ON ANY SINGLE FINANCIAL MEASURE. THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN EXPENSES THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR CORE OPERATING RESULTS.  ADJUSTED EBITDA  OUR MANAGEMENT USES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO ASSESS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME OF HUNTSMAN CORPORATION OR HUNTSMAN INTERNATIONAL, AS APPROPRIATE, BEFORE INTEREST, INCOME TAX, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND CERTAIN CORPORATE AND OTHER ITEMS, AS WELL AS ELIMINATING THE FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENTS: (A) BUSINESS ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES; (B) PURCHASE ACCOUNTING INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS; (C) MERGER COSTS; (D) EBITDA FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS; (E) NONCONTROLLING INTEREST OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS; (F) FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS TO VENATOR INVESTMENT; (G) LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; (H) CERTAIN LEGAL SETTLEMENTS AND RELATED EXPENSES (INCOME); (I) GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESSES/ASSETS; (J) AMORTIZATION OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT ACTUARIAL LOSSES; (K) PLANT INCIDENT REMEDIATION COSTS; (L) U.S. TAX REFORM ACT IMPACT ON NONCONTROLLING INTEREST; AND (M) RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND PLANT CLOSING AND TRANSITION COSTS (CREDITS). WE BELIEVE THAT NET INCOME OF HUNTSMAN CORPORATION OR HUNTSMAN INTERNATIONAL, AS APPROPRIATE, IS THE PERFORMANCE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP THAT IS MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO ADJUSTED EBITDA.  WE BELIEVE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN ASSESSING THE BUSINESSES\u2019 ONGOING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROVIDES IMPROVED COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS THROUGH THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN ITEMS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF THE BUSINESSES\u2019 OPERATIONAL PROFITABILITY AND THAT MAY OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS RESULTS AND TRENDS. HOWEVER, THIS MEASURE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OF HUNTSMAN CORPORATION OR HUNTSMAN INTERNATIONAL, AS APPROPRIATE, OR OTHER MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. MOREOVER, ADJUSTED EBITDA AS USED HEREIN IS NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES DUE TO POTENTIAL INCONSISTENCIES IN THE METHODS OF CALCULATION. OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS USEFUL TO COMPARE GENERAL OPERATING PERFORMANCE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND TO MAKE CERTAIN RELATED MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS ALSO USED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS, LENDERS AND OTHERS IN THEIR EVALUATION OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES CERTAIN ITEMS THAT CAN VARY WIDELY ACROSS DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES OR AMONG COMPANIES WITHIN THE SAME INDUSTRY. FOR EXAMPLE, INTEREST EXPENSE CAN BE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON A COMPANY\u2019S CAPITAL STRUCTURE, DEBT LEVELS AND CREDIT RATINGS. THEREFORE, THE IMPACT OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON EARNINGS CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, THE TAX POSITIONS OF COMPANIES CAN VARY BECAUSE OF THEIR DIFFERING ABILITIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TAX BENEFITS AND BECAUSE OF THE TAX POLICIES OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. AS A RESULT, EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND TAX EXPENSE CAN VARY CONSIDERABLY AMONG COMPANIES. FINALLY, COMPANIES EMPLOY PRODUCTIVE ASSETS OF DIFFERENT AGES AND UTILIZE DIFFERENT METHODS OF ACQUIRING AND DEPRECIATING SUCH ASSETS. THIS CAN RESULT IN CONSIDERABLE VARIABILITY IN THE RELATIVE COSTS OF PRODUCTIVE ASSETS AND THE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AMONG COMPANIES.  NEVERTHELESS, OUR MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT THERE ARE MATERIAL LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF ADJUSTED EBITDA IN THE EVALUATION OF OUR COMPANY AS COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF HUNTSMAN CORPORATION OR HUNTSMAN INTERNATIONAL, AS APPROPRIATE, WHICH REFLECTS OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE BORROWED MONEY IN ORDER TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS AND INTEREST EXPENSE IS A NECESSARY ELEMENT OF OUR COSTS AND ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE. OUR MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THE LIMITATIONS OF USING ADJUSTED EBITDA BY USING THIS MEASURE TO SUPPLEMENT U.S. GAAP RESULTS TO PROVIDE A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS AND TRENDS AFFECTING THE BUSINESS RATHER THAN U.S. GAAP RESULTS ALONE.  \u200b  ADJUSTED NET INCOME  ADJUSTED NET INCOME IS COMPUTED BY ELIMINATING THE AFTER TAX AMOUNTS RELATED TO THE FOLLOWING FROM NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO HUNTSMAN CORPORATION OR HUNTSMAN INTERNATIONAL, AS APPROPRIATE: (A) BUSINESS ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES; (B) PURCHASE ACCOUNTING INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS; (C) MERGER COSTS; (D) LOSS (INCOME) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS; (E) NONCONTROLLING INTEREST OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS; (F) FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS TO VENATOR INVESTMENT; (G) LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; (H) CERTAIN LEGAL SETTLEMENTS AND RELATED (INCOME) EXPENSES; (I) GAIN ON SALE OF ASSETS; (J) AMORTIZATION OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT ACTUARIAL LOSSES; (K) PLANT INCIDENT REMEDIATION COSTS; (L) RELEASE OR ESTABLISHMENT OF SIGNIFICANT INCOME TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES; (M) U.S. TAX REFORM ACT IMPACT ON INCOME TAX EXPENSE;  51  TABLE OF CONTENTS  (N) U.S. TAX REFORM ACT IMPACT ON NONCONTROLLING INTEREST; (O) IMPACT OF SWITZERLAND INCOME TAX RATE CHANGE; AND (P) RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND PLANT CLOSING AND TRANSITION COSTS (CREDITS). BASIC ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER SHARE EXCLUDES DILUTION AND IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING ADJUSTED NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. ADJUSTED DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE REFLECTS ALL POTENTIAL DILUTIVE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD AND IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING ADJUSTED NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD INCREASED BY THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING AS DILUTIVE SECURITIES.

FREE CASH FLOW IS NOT A DEFINED TERM UNDER U.S. GAAP, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE INFERRED THAT THE ENTIRE FREE CASH FLOW AMOUNT IS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES. THE COMPANY DEFINES FREE CASH FLOW AS CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING ACQUISITION/DISPOSITION ACTIVITIES AND INCLUDING NON-RECURRING SEPARATION COSTS. FREE CASH FLOW IS TYPICALLY DERIVED DIRECTLY FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS; HOWEVER, IT MAY BE ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS THAT AFFECT COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS.  ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  WE BELIEVE THAT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF HUNTSMAN CORPORATION OR HUNTSMAN INTERNATIONAL, AS APPROPRIATE, IS THE PERFORMANCE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP THAT IS MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. WE BELIEVE OUR ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE PROVIDES IMPROVED COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS THROUGH THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN ITEMS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF THE BUSINESSES\u2019 OPERATIONAL PROFITABILITY AND THAT MAY OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS RESULTS AND TRENDS. WE DO NOT PROVIDE RECONCILIATIONS FOR ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON A FORWARD-LOOKING BASIS BECAUSE WE ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL OR ACCURATE CALCULATION OR ESTIMATION OF RECONCILING ITEMS AND THE INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE WITHOUT UNREASONABLE EFFORT. THIS IS DUE TO THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF FORECASTING THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CERTAIN ITEMS, SUCH AS BUSINESS ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES, MERGER COSTS, CERTAIN LEGAL AND OTHER SETTLEMENTS AND RELATED COSTS, GAINS ON SALE OF BUSINESS/ASSETS, AND AMORTIZATION OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT ACTUARIAL LOSSES.

AS PART OF OUR INTERIM REVIEW FOR INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT, WE ANALYZED POTENTIAL CHANGES IN VALUE OF INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS WITH GOODWILL BASED ON EACH REPORTING UNIT\u2019S OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO EXPECTED RESULTS. IN ADDITION, WE CONSIDERED HOW OTHER KEY ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING DISCOUNT RATES AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES, USED IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR\u2019S IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS, COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS AND ECONOMIC EVENTS.  WE CONSIDERED TRENDS IN THESE FACTORS WHEN PERFORMING OUR ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER AN INTERIM IMPAIRMENT REVIEW WAS REQUIRED FOR ANY REPORTING UNIT. BASED ON THIS INTERIM ASSESSMENT, WE CONCLUDED THAT AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, NO EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATED THAT IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE FOR ANY REPORTING UNIT HAD DECLINED BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. NEVERTHELESS, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS COULD RESULT IN CHANGES TO EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS AND KEY VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS. SUCH CHANGES COULD RESULT IN REVISIONS OF OUR ESTIMATES OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS AND COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN A FUTURE INTERIM PERIOD OR AS OF OCT  OBER 31, 2019, OUR NEXT ANNUAL MEASUREMENT DATE.  IN PARTICULAR, WE HAD ONE REPORTING UNIT IN THE BUSINESS SERVICES SEGMENT EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN SALES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.

IN ADDITION, REPATRIATION OF SOME FOREIGN CASH BALANCES IS FURTHER RESTRICTED BY LOCAL LAWS. WE REGULARLY EVALUATE WHETHER FOREIGN EARNINGS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED. THIS EVALUATION REQUIRES JUDGMENT ABOUT OUR FUTURE OPERATING AND LIQUIDITY NEEDS. CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS, FOREIGN OR U.S. TAX LAWS, OR OUR FINANCIAL SITUATION COULD RESULT IN CHANGES TO THESE JUDGMENTS AND THE NEED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES.

PROCEEDS FROM THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT, NET OF A $5.5 MILLION DISCOUNT, WERE USED TO REPURCHASE CERTAIN SENIOR NOTES, PAY TRANSACTION FEES AND REPAY A PORTION OF BORROWINGS UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT.  OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE GUARANTEED BY OUR MATERIAL DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES (THE \u201cGUARANTORS\u201d) AND ARE SECURED BY A SECURITY INTEREST IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ASSETS OF OURS AND THE GUARANTORS, INCLUDING CERTAIN MATERIAL REAL PROPERTY, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS AND EXCLUSIONS.

THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS CUSTOMARY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS, INCLUDING A COVENANT WHICH REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO UNDERTAKE CERTAIN ACTIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PREPAY CERTAIN JUNIOR DEBT, INCUR ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS AND MAKE CERTAIN RESTRICTED PAYMENTS (INCLUDING EXTERNAL DIVIDENDS) DEPENDS ON SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MEETING MINIMUM BORROWING AVAILABILITY THRESHOLDS UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT.

DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE TRANSFERRED APPROXIMATELY $122 MILLION OF CASH HELD IN INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS TO THE U.S. WHICH WAS USED TO REDUCE DEBT OUTSTANDING. BASED ON CURRENT REGULATIONS AND PROCESS REQUIREMENTS, WE EXPECT TO TRANSFER ADDITIONAL CASH HELD IN INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS TO THE U.S. IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2019.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE DEBT COVENANTS UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT  AND EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES OF OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR 2019 AND THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE MET ALL THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO BORROW UNDER THE  ABL  CREDIT AGREEMENT AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MEET THE BORROWING CONDITIONS.  THE FAILURE OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SUPPORTING THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT WOULD REDUCE THE SIZE OF OUR COMMITTED FACILITY UNLESS A REPLACEMENT INSTITUTION WAS ADDED. CURRENTLY, THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT IS SUPPORTED BY EIGHT U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD $156.5 MILLION IN OTHER UNCOMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, PRIMARILY OUTSIDE THE U.S. (THE \u201cOTHER FACILITIES\u201d). THERE WERE $103.2 MILLION IN OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEES AND BANK ACCEPTANCE DRAFTS OF WHICH $33.8 MILLION WERE ISSUED, AND REDUCED AVAILABILITY, UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT. TOTAL BORROWINGS UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER FACILITIES (THE \u201cCOMBINED FACILITIES\u201d) WERE $300.5 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2019.

DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, WE RECEIVED NON-REFUNDABLE DEPOSITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $32.1 MILLION, WHICH ARE RECORDED IN OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS WILL BE PAID TO US IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT. BASED ON THE CURRENT EXCHANGE RATE, GROSS PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE, INCLUDING NON-REFUNDABLE DEPOSITS, ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $250.0 MILLION  AND WE EXPECT THE TRANSACTION TO CLOSE IN 2021 AFTER CLOSING CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED AND GOVERNMENT APPROVALS ARE OBTAINED. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE CARRYING COST OF THE BUILDING AND LAND USE RIGHTS IS RECORDED IN OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS AND IS NOT MATERIAL.  DIVIDENDS  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE PAID CASH DIVIDENDS OF $4.3 MILLION.

AT JUNE 30, 2019, OUR VARIABLE-INTEREST BORROWINGS WERE $847.7 MILLION. APPROXIMATELY 60.4% OF OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT WAS COMPRISED OF FIXED-RATE DEBT AS OF JUNE 30, 2019.  WE ASSESS MARKET RISK BASED ON CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES UTILIZING A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS THAT MEASURES THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN EARNINGS, FAIR VALUES AND CASH FLOWS BASED ON A HYPOTHETICAL 10% CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES. USING THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, SUCH CHANGES WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON INTEREST INCOME OR EXPENSE AND CASH FLOWS AND WOULD CHANGE THE FAIR VALUES OF FIXED-RATE DEBT AT JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018 BY APPROXIMATELY $31.6 MILLION AND $35.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BASED ON OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. THE EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS WITHIN MANY COUNTRIES IS LIMITED BECAUSE THE OPERATING REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF OUR VARIOUS SUBSIDIARIES AND BUSINESS UNITS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE LOCAL CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. TO THE EXTENT THAT BORROWINGS, SALES, PURCHASES, REVENUES, EXPENSES OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT IN THE LOCAL CURRENCY OF THE SUBSIDIARY, WE ARE EXPOSED TO CURRENCY RISK AND MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE CURRENCY RISK. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF OUTSTANDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $156.9 MILLION AND $170.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY (SEE NOTE 15,  DERIVATIVES  , TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). NET UNREALIZED (LOSSES) GAINS FROM THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS WERE LOSSES OF $1.3 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2019 AND GAINS OF $0.6 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING OR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OUR FISCAL YEAR, WHICH ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY OF NOVEMBER, PERIODICALLY RESULTS IN A 53-WEEK YEAR INSTEAD OF THE NORMAL 52 WEEKS.  THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR ENDING NOVEMBER 30,  201  9  IS A 53-WEEK YEAR, WITH THE ADDITIONAL WEEK BEING INCLUDED IN OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER.  ACCORDINGLY, THE INFORMATION PRESENTED BELOW INCLUDES  27  WEEKS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE  SIX MONTHS  ENDED  JUNE 1  , 201  9  AS COMPARED  TO  26  WEEKS INCLUDED IN THE  SIX MONTHS  ENDED  MAY 26  , 201  8.  OVERVIEW  BASSETT IS A LEADING RETAILER, MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF BRANDED HOME FURNISHINGS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRIMARILY THROUGH A NETWORK OF COMPANY-OWNED AND LICENSEE-OWNED BRANDED STORES UNDER THE BASSETT HOME FURNISHINGS (\u201cBHF\u201d) NAME, WITH ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION THROUGH OTHER WHOLESALE CHANNELS INCLUDING MULTI-LINE FURNITURE STORES, MANY OF WHICH FEATURE BASSETT GALLERIES OR DESIGN CENTERS. WE WERE FOUNDED IN 1902 AND INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF VIRGINIA IN 1930. OUR RICH 117-YEAR HISTORY HAS INSTILLED THE PRINCIPLES OF QUALITY, VALUE, AND INTEGRITY IN EVERYTHING WE DO, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVIDING US WITH THE EXPERTISE TO RESPOND TO EVER-CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES AND MEET THE DEMANDS OF A GLOBAL ECONOMY.  WITH 103 BHF STORES AT JUNE 1, 2019 WE HAVE LEVERAGED OUR STRONG BRAND NAME IN FURNITURE INTO A NETWORK OF COMPANY-OWNED AND LICENSED STORES THAT FOCUS ON PROVIDING CONSUMERS WITH A FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT FOR BUYING FURNITURE AND ACCESSORIES.  OUR STORE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SINGLE SOURCE HOME FURNISHINGS RETAIL STORE THAT PROVIDES A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF STYLISH, QUALITY FURNITURE AND ACCESSORIES WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.  IN ORDER TO REACH MARKETS THAT CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY SERVED BY OUR RETAIL STORE NETWORK, WE ALSO DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH OTHER WHOLESALE CHANNELS INCLUDING MULTI-LINE FURNITURE STORES, MANY OF WHICH FEATURE BASSETT GALLERIES OR DESIGN CENTERS. WE USE A NETWORK OF OVER 30 INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHO HAVE STATED GEOGRAPHICAL TERRITORIES. THESE SALES REPRESENTATIVES ARE COMPENSATED BASED ON A STANDARD COMMISSION RATE. WE BELIEVE THIS BLENDED STRATEGY PROVIDES US THE GREATEST ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND ULTIMATELY GAIN MARKET SHARE.  THE BHF STORES FEATURE CUSTOM ORDER FURNITURE, FREE IN-HOME DESIGN VISITS (\u201cHOME MAKEOVERS\u201d), AND COORDINATED DECORATING ACCESSORIES.  OUR PHILOSOPHY IS BASED ON BUILDING STRONG LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH CUSTOMER.  SALES PEOPLE ARE REFERRED TO AS \u201cDESIGN CONSULTANTS\u201d AND ARE TRAINED TO EVALUATE CUSTOMER NEEDS AND PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THEIR HOME DECOR.  UNTIL A RIGOROUS TRAINING AND DESIGN CERTIFICATION PROGRAM IS COMPLETED, DESIGN CONSULTANTS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO PERFORM IN-HOME DESIGN SERVICES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.  WE HAVE FACTORIES IN NEWTON, NORTH CAROLINA AND GRAND PRAIRIE, TEXAS THAT MANUFACTURE CUSTOM UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE, A FACTORY IN MARTINSVILLE, VIRGINIA THAT PRIMARILY ASSEMBLES AND FINISHES OUR CUSTOM CASUAL DINING OFFERINGS AND A FACTORY IN BASSETT, VIRGINIA THAT ASSEMBLES AND FINISHES OUR \u201cBENCH MADE\u201d LINE OF CUSTOM, SOLID HARDWOOD FURNITURE. OUR MANUFACTURING TEAM TAKES GREAT PRIDE IN THE BREADTH OF ITS OPTIONS, THE PRECISION OF ITS CRAFTSMANSHIP, AND THE SPEED OF ITS PROCESS, WITH CUSTOM PIECES OFTEN MANUFACTURED WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF TAKING THE ORDER IN OUR STORES. OUR LOGISTICS TEAM THEN PROMPTLY SHIPS THE PRODUCT TO ONE OF OUR HOME DELIVERY HUBS OR TO A LOCATION SPECIFIED BY OUR LICENSEES.  IN ADDITION TO THE FURNITURE THAT WE MANUFACTURE DOMESTICALLY, WE SOURCE MOST OF OUR FORMAL BEDROOM AND DINING ROOM FURNITURE (CASEGOODS) AND CERTAIN LEATHER UPHOLSTERY OFFERINGS FROM SEVERAL FOREIGN PLANTS, PRIMARILY IN VIETNAM AND CHINA. OVER 70% OF THE PRODUCTS WE CURRENTLY SELL ARE MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES.  WE ALSO OWN ZENITH FREIGHT LINES, LLC (\u201cZENITH\u201d) WHICH PROVIDES LOGISTICAL SERVICES TO BASSETT ALONG WITH OTHER FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS. ZENITH DELIVERS BEST-OF-CLASS SHIPPING AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ARE UNIQUELY TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF BASSETT AND THE FURNITURE INDUSTRY. OVER 60% OF ZENITH\u2019S REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM SERVICES PROVIDED TO NON-BASSETT CUSTOMERS.  ON DECEMBER 21, 2017, WE PURCHASED CERTAIN ASSETS AND ASSUMED CERTAIN LIABILITIES OF LANE VENTURE FROM HERITAGE HOME GROUP, LLC FOR $15,556 IN CASH. LANE VENTURE IS A MANUFACTURER AND DISTRIBUTOR OF PREMIUM OUTDOOR FURNITURE, AND IS NOW BEING OPERATED AS A COMPONENT OF OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT. THIS ACQUISITION MARKED OUR ENTRY INTO THE MARKET FOR OUTDOOR FURNITURE AND WE BELIEVE THAT LANE VENTURE HAS PROVIDED A FOUNDATION FOR US TO BECOME A SIGNIFICANT PARTICIPANT IN THIS CATEGORY. WE PLAN TO DISTRIBUTE THIS BRAND OUTSIDE OF OUR BASSETT STORE NETWORK WITH PLANS TO INTRODUCE A BASSETT-BRANDED LINE IN THE STORES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. SEE NOTE 3 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING THIS ACQUISITION.  24 OF 40  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  JUNE 1, 2019  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  AT JUNE 1, 2019, OUR BHF STORE NETWORK INCLUDED 70 COMPANY-OWNED STORES AND 33 LICENSEE-OWNED STORES. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE OPENED ONE NEW STORE IN SARASOTA, FLORIDA.  WE CONTINUE TO EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY OF GROWING THE COMPANY THROUGH OPENING NEW STORES, REPOSITIONING STORES TO IMPROVED LOCATIONS WITHIN A MARKET AND CLOSING UNDERPERFORMING STORES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS PLANNED STORE OPENINGS WHERE LEASES HAVE BEEN EXECUTED.  SIZE  PLANNED  LOCATION  TYPE  SQ. FT.  OPENING  NEW STORES.  PRINCETON, NJ  CORPORATE  13,000  Q4 2019  THORNTON, CO  LICENSEE  23,000  Q1 2020  REPOSITIONINGS.  PALM BEACH, FL  CORPORATE  15,000  Q1 2020  FOLLOWING THE PLANNED OPENINGS SHOWN ABOVE, WE EXPECT TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE PACE OF THE BHF NETWORK EXPANSION AND FOCUS ON MAXIMIZING PROFITABLE SALES VOLUME THROUGH OUR EXISTING STORES.  AS WITH ANY RETAIL OPERATION, PRIOR TO OPENING A NEW STORE WE INCUR SUCH EXPENSES AS RENT, TRAINING COSTS AND OTHER PAYROLL RELATED COSTS. THESE COSTS GENERALLY RANGE BETWEEN $200 TO $400 PER STORE DEPENDING ON THE OVERALL RENT COSTS FOR THE LOCATION AND THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE TIME WHEN WE TAKE PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE STORE SPACE AND THE TIME OF THE STORE OPENING. GENERALLY, RENT PAYMENTS DURING A BUILDOUT PERIOD BETWEEN DELIVERY OF POSSESSION AND OPENING OF A NEW STORE ARE DEFERRED AND THEREFORE STRAIGHT LINE RENT EXPENSE RECOGNIZED DURING THAT TIME DOES NOT REQUIRE CASH. INHERENT IN OUR RETAIL BUSINESS MODEL, WE ALSO INCUR LOSSES IN THE TWO TO THREE MONTHS OF OPERATION FOLLOWING A NEW STORE OPENING. LIKE OTHER FURNITURE RETAILERS, WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE A SALE UNTIL THE FURNITURE IS DELIVERED TO OUR CUSTOMER. BECAUSE OUR RETAIL BUSINESS MODEL GENERALLY DOES NOT INVOLVE MAINTAINING A STOCK OF RETAIL INVENTORY THAT WOULD RESULT IN QUICK DELIVERY AND BECAUSE OF THE CUSTOM NATURE OF MANY OF OUR FURNITURE OFFERINGS, DELIVERY TO OUR CUSTOMERS USUALLY OCCURS ABOUT 30 DAYS AFTER AN ORDER IS PLACED. WE GENERALLY REQUIRE A DEPOSIT AT THE TIME OF ORDER AND COLLECT THE REMAINING BALANCE WHEN THE FURNITURE IS DELIVERED, AT WHICH TIME THE SALE IS RECOGNIZED. COUPLED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS, TOTAL START-UP LOSSES CAN RANGE FROM $400 TO $600 PER STORE. WHILE OUR RETAIL EXPANSION IS INITIALLY COSTLY, WE BELIEVE OUR SITE SELECTION AND NEW STORE PRESENTATION WILL GENERALLY RESULT IN LOCATIONS THAT OPERATE AT OR ABOVE A RETAIL BREAK-EVEN LEVEL WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME FOLLOWING STORE OPENING. FACTORS AFFECTING THE LENGTH OF TIME REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS MAY INCLUDE THE LEVEL OF BRAND RECOGNITION, THE DEGREE OF LOCAL COMPETITION, THE DEPTH OF PENETRATION IN A PARTICULAR MARKET AND THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE LOCAL AND U.S. ECONOMY. EVEN AS NEW STORES RAMP UP TO BREAK-EVEN, WE DO REALIZE ADDITIONAL WHOLESALE SALES VOLUME THAT LEVERAGES THE FIXED COSTS IN OUR WHOLESALE BUSINESS.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR DIGITAL EFFORT TO IMPROVE OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 JOURNEY FROM THE TIME THEY BEGIN ON OUR WEBSITE TO THE FINAL STEP OF DELIVERING THE GOODS TO THEIR HOMES. TODAY\u2019S CUSTOMERS EXPECT THEIR DIGITAL EXPERIENCES AND COMMUNICATIONS TO BE PERSONALIZED, HIGHLY-RELEVANT AND CATERED TO MATCH THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND PREFERENCES.

QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF RESULTS - WHOLESALE  THE 1.0% DECREASE IN THE NET SALES FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A 6.6% DECREASE IN FURNITURE SHIPMENTS TO THE OPEN MARKET (OUTSIDE THE BASSETT HOME FURNISHINGS NETWORK), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $298 INCREASE IN LANE VENTURE SHIPMENTS. SHIPMENTS TO THE BASSETT HOME FURNISHINGS NETWORK WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. GROSS MARGIN FOR THE WHOLESALE SEGMENT WAS 34.3% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 32.9% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER MARGINS IN THE DOMESTIC CUSTOM UPHOLSTERY OPERATIONS AS PRICE INCREASES IMPLEMENTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 OFFSET THE INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS EXPERIENCED LATE IN 2017 AND EARLY 2018. WHOLESALE SG&A FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 INCREASED TO 29.3% AS COMPARED TO 28.1% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER OVER-THE-ROAD FREIGHT COSTS ALONG WITH HIGHER MARKETING AND OTHER BRAND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION COSTS.  29 OF 40  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  JUNE 1, 2019  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  YEAR-TO-DATE  ANALYSIS OF RESULTS - WHOLESALE  ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS (NORMALIZING FOR 27 WEEKS COMPARED TO 26 WEEKS), NET SALES INCREASED $3,990 OR 3.1%. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A $2,304 INCREASE IN LANE VENTURE SHIPMENTS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WHEN WE WERE THEN IN THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING THE NEWLY ACQUIRED OPERATIONS INTO THE COMPANY, ALONG WITH A 2.0% INCREASE IN SHIPMENTS TO THE BHF NETWORK PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 0.6% DECREASE IN FURNITURE SHIPMENTS TO THE OPEN MARKET (OUTSIDE THE BHF NETWORK). GROSS MARGIN FOR THE WHOLESALE SEGMENT WAS 33.5% FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 32.6% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER MARGINS IN DOMESTIC CUSTOM UPHOLSTERY OPERATIONS AS PRICE INCREASES IMPLEMENTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 OFFSET THE INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS EXPERIENCED LATE IN 2017 AND EARLY 2018. THIS MARGIN IMPROVEMENT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARGINS IN THE IMPORTED CASEGOODS OPERATION DUE TO A $390 INVENTORY VALUATION CHARGE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR EXIT FROM THE JUVENILE LINE OF BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, BOTH THE UPHOLSTERY AND WOOD OPERATIONS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY HIGHER LABOR COSTS DUE TO HIGHER EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE EXPENSES FROM UNFAVORABLE CLAIM EXPERIENCE, PRIMARILY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.

QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF RESULTS - RETAIL  THE DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE 70 COMPANY-OWNED BHF STORES WAS DRIVEN BY A 14.8% DECLINE IN SALES FOR THE 59 COMPARABLE STORES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $3,697 INCREASE IN NON-COMPARABLE STORE SALES AS WE HAVE OPENED 11 STORES OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS.  WHILE WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE SALES UNTIL GOODS ARE DELIVERED TO THE CONSUMER, MANAGEMENT TRACKS WRITTEN SALES (THE RETAIL DOLLAR VALUE OF SALES ORDERS TAKEN, RATHER THAN DELIVERED) AS A KEY STORE PERFORMANCE INDICATOR. WRITTEN SALES FOR COMPARABLE STORES DECREASED BY 7.4% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  31 OF 40  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  JUNE 1, 2019  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  THE DECREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE GROSS MARGINS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED WHOLESALE COSTS AS A RESULT OF TARIFFS ON CHINESE PRODUCTS INSTITUTED IN LATE 2018 ALONG WITH HIGHER COSTS OF FREIGHT, BOTH OF WHICH WERE PASSED ON IN A WHOLESALE PRICE INCREASE IN JANUARY 2019. ALTHOUGH MOST OF OUR GOODS ARE DOMESTICALLY MADE, AND MOST OF OUR OTHER GOODS ARE IMPORTED FROM COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF CHINA, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT FROM THE TARIFFS HAS BEEN IN THE COST OF THE FABRIC THAT WE USE IN OUR UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES. WE IMPLEMENTED A PRICE INCREASE LATE IN THE QUARTER TO MITIGATE THESE COST INCREASES.  THE INCREASE IN SG&A EXPENSES FOR COMPARABLE STORES AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES TO 53.8% WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DE-LEVERAGING OF FIXED COSTS FROM LOWER SALES VOLUMES, INEFFICIENCIES IN THE WAREHOUSE AND HOME DELIVERY OPERATION AND HIGHER FINANCING COSTS AS MORE OF OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS CHOSE TO FINANCE THEIR PURCHASES THROUGH OUR THIRD-PARTY CREDIT PROVIDER. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY VARIOUS FIXED COST DECREASES THAT RESULTED FROM CHANGES TO OUR COST STRUCTURE.  THE $485 INCREASE IN THE OPERATING LOSS FROM NON-COMPARABLE STORES FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 INCLUDES NEW STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS OF $369 COMPARED TO $201 FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. WE INCUR LOSSES IN THE FIRST TWO TO THREE MONTHS OF OPERATION FOLLOWING A STORE OPENING AS SALES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT UNTIL THE FURNITURE IS DELIVERED TO ITS CUSTOMERS RESULTING IN OPERATING EXPENSES WITHOUT THE NORMAL SALES VOLUME. BECAUSE WE DO NOT MAINTAIN A STOCK OF RETAIL INVENTORY THAT WOULD RESULT IN QUICK DELIVERY, AND BECAUSE OF THE CUSTOM NATURE OF THE FURNITURE OFFERINGS, SUCH DELIVERIES ARE GENERALLY NOT MADE UNTIL AFTER 30 DAYS FROM WHEN THE FURNITURE IS ORDERED BY THE CUSTOMER. COUPLED WITH THE PRE-OPENING COSTS, TOTAL START-UP LOSSES TYPICALLY AMOUNT TO $400 TO $600 PER STORE. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WE INCURRED $299 OF POST-OPENING LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE THREE NEW STORES OPENED DURING THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS OF 2019 COMPARED TO $411 OF POST-OPENING LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER LOCATIONS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  EACH ADDITION TO OUR COMPANY-OWNED STORE NETWORK RESULTS IN INCREMENTAL FIXED OVERHEAD COSTS, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH LOCAL STORE PERSONNEL, OCCUPANCY COSTS AND WAREHOUSING EXPENSES. THE INCREMENTAL SG&A EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH NEW STORE WILL BE ONGOING.  YEAR-TO-DATE  ANALYSIS OF RESULTS - RETAIL  THE DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE 70 COMPANY-OWNED BHF STORES WAS DRIVEN BY A 7.5% DECREASE FOR THE 57 COMPARABLE STORES FROM THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $8,459 INCREASE IN NON-COMPARABLE STORE SALES AS WE HAVE OPENED 13 STORES OVER THE LAST 21 MONTHS. ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS (NORMALIZING FOR THE EXTRA WEEK IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2019), COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECREASED 10.9%.  WHILE WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE SALES UNTIL GOODS ARE DELIVERED TO THE CONSUMER, MANAGEMENT TRACKS WRITTEN SALES (THE RETAIL DOLLAR VALUE OF SALES ORDERS TAKEN, RATHER THAN DELIVERED) AS A KEY STORE PERFORMANCE INDICATOR. WRITTEN SALES FOR COMPARABLE STORES DECREASED BY 6.1% FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST HALF OF 2018. ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS, COMPARABLE STORE WRITTEN SALES DECREASED 9.6%.  THE DECREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE GROSS MARGINS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED WHOLESALE COSTS AS A RESULT OF TARIFFS ON CHINESE PRODUCTS INSTITUTED IN LATE 2018 ALONG WITH HIGHER COSTS OF FREIGHT, BOTH OF WHICH WERE PASSED ON IN A WHOLESALE PRICE INCREASE IN JANUARY 2019. ALTHOUGH MOST OF OUR GOODS ARE DOMESTICALLY MADE, AND MOST OF OUR OTHER GOODS ARE IMPORTED FROM COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF CHINA, THE TARIFFS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COST OF A PORTION OF THE FABRIC THAT WE USE IN OUR UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES. WE IMPLEMENTED A PRICE INCREASE LATE IN THE QUARTER TO MITIGATE THESE COST INCREASES. GROSS MARGINS WERE ALSO IMPACTED BY INCREASED CLEARANCE ACTIVITY PRIMARILY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE TO THE LAUNCH OF THE NEW CUSTOM UPHOLSTERY PROGRAM AND THE SELLOFF OF EXISTING FLOOR SAMPLES AND OTHER CLEARANCE PRODUCT AS A RESULT OF THE REPOSITIONING OF TWO STORES IN THE HOUSTON MARKET LATE IN 2018.  THE INCREASE IN SG&A EXPENSES FOR COMPARABLE STORES AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES TO 52.5% WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DE-LEVERAGING OF FIXED COSTS FROM LOWER SALES VOLUMES, INEFFICIENCIES IN THE WAREHOUSE AND HOME DELIVERY OPERATION, HIGHER EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE EXPENSES FROM UNFAVORABLE CLAIM EXPERIENCE PRIMARILY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND HIGHER FINANCING COSTS AS MORE OF OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS CHOSE TO FINANCE THEIR PURCHASES THROUGH OUR THIRD-PARTY CREDIT PROVIDER. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY VARIOUS FIXED COST DECREASES THAT RESULTED FROM CHANGES TO OUR COST STRUCTURE.  32 OF 40  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  JUNE 1, 2019  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  THE $630 INCREASE IN THE OPERATING LOSS FROM NON-COMPARABLE STORES FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 INCLUDES NEW STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS OF $863 COMPARED TO $903 FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. WE INCUR LOSSES IN THE FIRST TWO TO THREE MONTHS OF OPERATION FOLLOWING A STORE OPENING AS SALES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT UNTIL THE FURNITURE IS DELIVERED TO ITS CUSTOMERS RESULTING IN OPERATING EXPENSES WITHOUT THE NORMAL SALES VOLUME. BECAUSE WE DO NOT MAINTAIN A STOCK OF RETAIL INVENTORY THAT WOULD RESULT IN QUICK DELIVERY, AND BECAUSE OF THE CUSTOM NATURE OF THE FURNITURE OFFERINGS, SUCH DELIVERIES ARE GENERALLY NOT MADE UNTIL AFTER 30 DAYS FROM WHEN THE FURNITURE IS ORDERED BY THE CUSTOMER. COUPLED WITH THE PRE-OPENING COSTS, TOTAL START-UP LOSSES TYPICALLY AMOUNT TO $400 TO $600 PER STORE. DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 WE INCURRED $1,128 OF POST-OPENING LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIVE NEW STORES OPENED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 COMPARED TO $1,151 OF POST-OPENING LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER LOCATIONS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2018.  EACH ADDITION TO OUR COMPANY-OWNED STORE NETWORK RESULTS IN INCREMENTAL FIXED OVERHEAD COSTS, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH LOCAL STORE PERSONNEL, OCCUPANCY COSTS AND WAREHOUSING EXPENSES. THE INCREMENTAL SG&A EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH NEW STORE WILL BE ONGOING.  RETAIL BACKLOG  THE DOLLAR VALUE OF OUR RETAIL BACKLOG, REPRESENTING ORDERS RECEIVED BUT NOT YET DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS, WAS $30,910, OR AN AVERAGE OF $442 PER OPEN STORE, AT JUNE 1, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH A RETAIL BACKLOG OF $28,697, OR AN AVERAGE OF $448 PER OPEN STORE, AT MAY 26, 2018.

QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 LOGISTICAL SERVICES  THE DECREASE IN REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED DISCONTINUATION OF HOME DELIVERY SERVICES TO THIRD-PARTY CUSTOMERS. THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN ZENITH\u2019S OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED EFFICIENCIES IN THE MIDDLE MILE OPERATION DUE TO LOWER FREIGHT VOLUMES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED EXPENSES IN THE HOME DELIVERY OPERATION.  YEAR-TO-DATE  ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 LOGISTICAL SERVICES  ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS (NORMALIZING FOR THE EXTRA WEEK IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019), REVENUES FOR ZENITH DECREASED $2,357 OR 5.5%. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED DISCONTINUATION OF HOME DELIVERY SERVICES TO THIRD-PARTY CUSTOMERS. THE DECREASE IN ZENITH\u2019S OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED EXPENSES IN THE HOME DELIVERY OPERATION.  OTHER  ITEMS  A  FFECTING  N  ET  INCOME  EARLY RETIREMENT PROGRAM  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE OFFERED AN EARLY RETIREMENT PACKAGE TO CERTAIN ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY. TWENTY-THREE EMPLOYEES ACCEPTED THE OFFER, WHICH EXPIRED ON FEBRUARY 28, 2019. THESE EMPLOYEES ARE TO RECEIVE PAY EQUAL TO ONE-HALF THEIR CURRENT SALARY PLUS BENEFITS OVER A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR FROM THE FINAL DAY OF EACH INDIVIDUAL\u2019S ACTIVE EMPLOYMENT. ACCORDINGLY, WE RECOGNIZED A CHARGE OF $733 DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019. THE UNPAID OBLIGATION OF $835 AT JUNE 1, 2019 WILL SUBSTANTIALLY BE PAID OUT WITHIN ONE YEAR.  33 OF 40  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  JUNE 1, 2019  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  OTHER  L  OSS,  N  ET  OTHER LOSS, NET, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019 WAS $145 AS COMPARED TO $233 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 26, 2018. THE DECREASED NET LOSS IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER NET COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPANY-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE AND INCREASED INTEREST INCOME DUE TO RISING YIELDS ON OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  OTHER LOSS, NET, FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019 WAS $268 AS COMPARED TO $860 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 26, 2018. THE DECREASED NET LOSS IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LARGER TOTAL DEATH BENEFITS RECEIVED IN FISCAL 2019 FROM LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES COVERING FORMER EXECUTIVES, INCREASED INTEREST INCOME DUE TO RISING YIELDS ON OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AND LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO OVERALL LOWER LEVELS OF DEBT.  INCOME  T  AXES  AND IMPACT OF TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT  WE CALCULATE AN ANTICIPATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR BASED ON OUR ANNUAL ESTIMATES OF PRETAX INCOME AND USE THAT EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO RECORD OUR YEAR-TO-DATE INCOME TAX PROVISION.  ANY CHANGE IN ANNUAL PROJECTIONS OF PRETAX INCOME COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE RESPECTIVE QUARTER.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cACT\u201d) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE ACT REDUCED THE FEDERAL STATUTORY CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 FOR ALL CORPORATE TAXPAYERS.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019 DIFFERS FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF STATE INCOME TAXES AND VARIOUS PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, INCLUDING THE RECOGNITION OF NON-TAXABLE PROCEEDS FROM COMPANY-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE.  BECAUSE THE ACT SPECIFIED THE NEW 21% TAX RATE BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2018, WE WERE ONLY SUBJECT TO THE REDUCED RATE FOR 11 MONTHS OF 2018.  THEREFORE, WE COMPUTED OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2018 USING A BLENDED FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 22.2%.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 26, 2018 OF 21.3% AND 51.4%, RESPECTIVELY, DIFFER FROM THE BLENDED STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO A DISCRETE CHARGE (BENEFIT) OF ($155) AND $2,032, RESPECTIVELY, ARISING FROM THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THE LOWER STATUTORY RATE.  OTHER ITEMS IMPACTING OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 26, 2018 INCLUDED THE EFFECTS OF STATE INCOME TAXES AND VARIOUS PERMANENT DIFFERENCES INCLUDING THE FAVORABLE IMPACTS OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ON STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION OF $16 AND $197, RESPECTIVELY, NON-TAXABLE LIFE INSURANCE PROCEEDS OF $266 DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, AND THE SECTION 199: DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES DEDUCTION, WHICH WAS ELIMINATED BY THE ACT FOR OUR FISCAL 2019 TAX RETURN.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH FLOWS  ALTHOUGH WE GENERATED $6,792 IN OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, CASH USED IN OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 WAS $8,942 COMPARED TO $279 PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2018, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE IN CASH USED OF $9,221. THIS INCREASE USE OF CASH IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INVESTMENT IN INVENTORY DUE TO OPENING NEW STORES, OTHER CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL DUE IN PART TO THE TIMING IMPACT OF THE ADDITIONAL WEEK IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND LOWER COMPARABLE STORE SALES ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS RESULTING IN REDUCED CASH FLOWS.  OUR OVERALL CASH POSITION DECREASED BY $21,887 DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2019. IN ADDITION TO THE CASH USED IN OPERATIONS, WE USED $7,959 OF CASH IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL STORE EXPANSION AND RELOCATIONS. NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $4,986, INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OF $2,603 AND STOCK REPURCHASES OF $2,347 UNDER OUR EXISTING SHARE REPURCHASE PLAN, OF WHICH $15,637 REMAINS AUTHORIZED AT JUNE 1, 2019. WITH CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALING $34,224 ON HAND AT JUNE 1, 2019, EXPECTED FUTURE OPERATING CASH FLOWS, EXPECTED REDUCED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FROM FEWER STORE OPENINGS AND THE AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT LINE NOTED BELOW, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO FUND OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  DEBT AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS  OUR CREDIT FACILITY WITH OUR BANK PROVIDES FOR A LINE OF CREDIT OF UP TO $25,000. THIS CREDIT FACILITY IS UNSECURED AND CONTAINS COVENANTS REQUIRING US TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN KEY FINANCIAL RATIOS. WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE AGREEMENT AND EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL MATURE IN DECEMBER 2021.

INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE MADE. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE.  IN THE  12  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA REFLECT THE MONTHS OF  MARCH, APRIL AND MAY  . IN THE  24  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA REFLECT THE MONTHS OF  JANUARY THROUGH MAY  . IN THE  24 WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES GENERATED  40%  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE, WITH MEXICO, RUSSIA, CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND CHINA COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY  19%  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE. AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD. IN EACH OF THE  12 AND 24 WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE REDUCED NET REVENUE GROWTH BY  3  PERCENTAGE POINTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN THE RUSSIAN RUBLE, TURKISH LIRA, EURO, ARGENTINE PESO AND BRAZILIAN REAL. CURRENCY DECLINES AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR WHICH ARE NOT OFFSET COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.  IN ADDITION, VOLATILE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND CIVIL UNREST IN CERTAIN MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD, INCLUDING IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, MEXICO, THE MIDDLE EAST, RUSSIA AND TURKEY, AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IN CERTAIN OF THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, CONTINUE TO, AND THE THREAT OR IMPOSITION OF TARIFFS IN OR RELATED TO THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS MAY, RESULT IN CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO THE UNITED KINGDOM\u2019S PENDING WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, INCLUDING HOW THE UNITED KINGDOM WILL INTERACT WITH OTHER EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES FOLLOWING ITS DEPARTURE, AS WELL AS THE ECONOMIC, OPERATING AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN RUSSIA AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT FOR THE ESSA SEGMENT AND OUR OTHER BUSINESSES.  CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD HAVE EITHER IMPOSED, OR ARE CONSIDERING IMPOSING, NEW OR INCREASED TAXES OR REGULATIONS ON THE MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION OR SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING, INGREDIENTS OR SUBSTANCES CONTAINED IN, OR ATTRIBUTES OF, OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING, COMMODITIES USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING OR THE RECYCLABILITY OR RECOVERABILITY OF OUR PACKAGING. THESE TAXES AND REGULATIONS VARY IN SCOPE AND FORM. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME TAXES APPLY TO ALL BEVERAGES, INCLUDING NON-CALORIC BEVERAGES, WHILE OTHERS APPLY ONLY TO BEVERAGES WITH A CALORIC SWEETENER (E.G., SUGAR). IN ADDITION, SOME REGULATIONS APPLY TO ALL PRODUCTS USING CERTAIN TYPES OF PACKAGING (E.G., PLASTIC), WHILE OTHERS ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF PACKAGING AND ENCOURAGE WASTE REDUCTION AND INCREASED RECYCLING RATES.  WE SELL A WIDE VARIETY OF BEVERAGES, FOODS AND SNACKS IN MORE THAN  200  COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES AND THE PROFILE OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL, THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH PRODUCTS AND THE TYPE OF PACKAGING USED VARIES BY JURISDICTION. BECAUSE OF THIS, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE SCOPE OR FORM POTENTIAL TAXES, REGULATIONS OR OTHER LIMITATIONS ON OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING MAY TAKE, AND THEREFORE CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT OF SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS OR LIMITATIONS ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, TAXES, REGULATIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY IMPACT US AND OUR COMPETITORS DIFFERENTLY. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR EXISTING AND PROPOSED TAXES AND REGULATIONS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED AND SOLD AND TO CONSIDER ACTIONS WE MAY TAKE TO POTENTIALLY MITIGATE THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OR LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING ADVOCATING ALTERNATIVE MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPOSITION, FORM AND SCOPE OF ANY SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS OR LIMITATIONS.  ADDITIONALLY, OUR INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO BE AFFECTED BY DISRUPTION OF THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE, INCLUDING THE RAPID GROWTH IN SALES THROUGH E-COMMERCE WEBSITES AND MOBILE COMMERCE APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, THE INTEGRATION OF PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL OPERATIONS AMONG RETAILERS AND THE INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION OF HARD DISCOUNTERS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR CHANGES IN THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE AND TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS WE MAY TAKE TO BUILD OUR GLOBAL E-COMMERCE CAPABILITIES, DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS EFFECTIVELY THROUGH ALL EXISTING AND EMERGING CHANNELS OF TRADE AND POTENTIALLY MITIGATE ANY UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS ON OUR FUTURE RESULTS.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, THE TCJ ACT WAS ENACTED IN THE UNITED STATES.  WHILE OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE RECORDED IMPACT OF THE  TCJ ACT  AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018 WAS DEEMED TO BE COMPLETE  , THIS AMOUNT WAS BASED ON PREVAILING REGULATIONS AND AVAILABLE INFORMATION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018, AND ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE  IRS  IMPACTED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO IMPACT, OUR RECORDED AMOUNTS AFTER DECEMBER 29, 2018.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF THE TCJ ACT, SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, \u201cOUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d AND \u201cOUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d IN THIS FORM 10-Q, AS WELL AS NOTE 5 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  2018  FORM 10-K.  IN A REFERENDUM HELD ON MAY 19, 2019, SWITZERLAND PASSED  TRAF  , EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020. THE TRAF DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE  12 AND 24 WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  . ENACTMENT OF TRAF PROVISIONS SUBSEQUENT TO OUR SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN FUTURE PERIODS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ASSESS THE IMPACT THE TRAF MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.  SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  SEE NOTE 9 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-Q FOR THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS OF  JUNE 15, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 29, 2018  AND NOTE 9 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  2018  FORM 10-K FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE ITEMS.

OUR DIVISIONS\u2019 PHYSICAL VOLUME MEASURES ARE CONVERTED INTO SERVINGS BASED ON U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION GUIDELINES FOR SINGLE-SERVING SIZES OF OUR PRODUCTS. FOR THE  12 AND 24 WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , TOTAL SERVINGS INCREASED 3% AND 3.5%, RESPECTIVELY.  WE DISCUSS VOLUME FOR OUR BEVERAGE BUSINESSES ON A BOTTLER CASE SALES (BCS) BASIS IN WHICH ALL BEVERAGE VOLUME IS CONVERTED TO AN 8-OUNCE-CASE METRIC. MOST OF OUR BEVERAGE VOLUME IS SOLD BY OUR COMPANY-OWNED AND FRANCHISE-OWNED BOTTLERS, AND THAT PORTION IS BASED ON OUR BOTTLERS\u2019 SALES TO RETAILERS AND INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS. THE REMAINDER OF OUR VOLUME IS BASED ON OUR DIRECT SHIPMENTS TO RETAILERS AND INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS. WE REPORT SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INTERNATIONAL BEVERAGE VOLUME ON A MONTHLY CALENDAR BASIS. THE  12  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  INCLUDE BEVERAGE VOLUME OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA FOR THE MONTHS OF  MARCH, APRIL AND MAY  .

NET INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED  $13 MILLION  , REFLECTING LOWER INTEREST INCOME DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE CASH BALANCES, AS WELL AS LOWER GAINS ON THE MARKET VALUE OF INVESTMENTS USED TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR DEFERRED COMPENSATION LIABILITY. THESE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES.

NON-GAAP MEASURES  CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-Q ADJUST FOR THE IMPACT OF SPECIFIED ITEMS AND ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP). WE USE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES INTERNALLY TO MAKE OPERATING AND STRATEGIC DECISIONS, INCLUDING THE PREPARATION OF OUR ANNUAL OPERATING PLAN, EVALUATION OF OUR OVERALL BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND AS A FACTOR IN DETERMINING COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. WE BELIEVE PRESENTING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THIS FORM 10-Q PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO FACILITATE COMPARISON OF OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS AND TRENDS IN OUR UNDERLYING OPERATING RESULTS, AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY ON HOW WE EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS. WE ALSO BELIEVE PRESENTING THESE MEASURES IN THIS FORM 10-Q ALLOWS INVESTORS TO VIEW OUR PERFORMANCE USING THE SAME MEASURES THAT WE USE IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS.  WE CONSIDER QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS IN ASSESSING WHETHER TO ADJUST FOR THE IMPACT OF ITEMS THAT MAY BE SIGNIFICANT OR THAT COULD AFFECT AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR ONGOING FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OR TRENDS. EXAMPLES OF ITEMS FOR WHICH WE MAY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE.  AMOUNTS RELATED TO MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS OR LOSSES (NON-CASH); CHARGES RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS; CHARGES OR ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE ENACTMENT OF NEW LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS, SUCH AS SIGNIFICANT TAX LAW CHANGES; AMOUNTS RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF TAX POSITIONS; TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO REORGANIZATIONS OF OUR OPERATIONS; AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND OTHER STRUCTURAL CHANGES; DEBT REDEMPTIONS, CASH TENDER OR EXCHANGE OFFERS; PENSION AND RETIREE MEDICAL RELATED ITEMS; ASSET IMPAIRMENTS (NON-CASH); AND REMEASUREMENTS OF NET MONETARY ASSETS.  SEE BELOW AND \u201cITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY\u201d FOR A DESCRIPTION OF ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  NON-GAAP INFORMATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPLEMENTAL IN NATURE AND IS NOT MEANT TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. IN ADDITION, OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY NOT BE THE SAME AS OR COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR NON-GAAP MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  THE FOLLOWING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-Q.  \u2022  COST OF SALES,  GROSS PROFIT, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, OTHER PENSION AND RETIREE MEDICAL BENEFITS INCOME, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, EACH ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY  ;  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  OPERATING PROFIT, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PEPSICO PER COMMON SHARE \u2013 DILUTED, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND THE CORRESPONDING CONSTANT CURRENCY GROWTH RATES  ;  \u2022  ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH; AND  \u2022  FREE CASH FLOW.  COST OF SALES,  GROSS PROFIT, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, OTHER PENSION AND RETIREE MEDICAL BENEFITS INCOME, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, EACH ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY  ,  OPERATING PROFIT, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PEPSICO PER COMMON SHARE \u2013 DILUTED, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND THE CORRESPONDING CONSTANT CURRENCY GROWTH RATES  THESE MEASURES EXCLUDE THE NET IMPACT OF MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON CENTRALLY MANAGED COMMODITY DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO OUR 2019 AND 2014 PRODUCTIVITY PLANS, INVENTORY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND MERGER AND INTEGRATION CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF SODASTREAM, TAX BENEFITS/NET TAX EXPENSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE TCJ ACT AND A TAX BENEFIT (SEE \u201cITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY\u201d FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF THESE ITEMS). WE ALSO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE ON OPERATING PROFIT, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PEPSICO PER COMMON SHARE  \u2013  DILUTED, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, WHICH MEASURE OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ASSUMING CONSTANT FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES USED FOR TRANSLATION BASED ON THE RATES IN EFFECT FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. IN ORDER TO COMPUTE OUR CONSTANT CURRENCY RESULTS, WE MULTIPLY OR DIVIDE, AS APPROPRIATE, OUR CURRENT-YEAR U.S. DOLLAR RESULTS BY THE CURRENT-YEAR AVERAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND THEN MULTIPLY OR DIVIDE, AS APPROPRIATE, THOSE AMOUNTS BY THE PRIOR-YEAR AVERAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. WE BELIEVE THESE MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION IN EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY EXCLUDE ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING PERFORMANCE.  ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH  WE DEFINE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AS NET REVENUE GROWTH ADJUSTED FOR THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT FROM ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND OTHER STRUCTURAL CHANGES. WE BELIEVE ORGANIC REVENUE PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION IN EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF ONGOING PERFORMANCE OR THAT WE BELIEVE IMPACT COMPARABILITY WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.  SEE \u201cNET REVENUE AND ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH\u201d IN \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \u2013  DIVISION REVIEW\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  FREE CASH FLOW  WE DEFINE FREE CASH FLOW AS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS CAPITAL SPENDING, PLUS SALES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. SINCE NET CAPITAL SPENDING IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR PRODUCT INNOVATION INITIATIVES AND MAINTAINING OUR OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS A RECURRING AND NECESSARY USE OF CASH. AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE INVESTORS SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER NET CAPITAL SPENDING WHEN EVALUATING OUR CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. FREE CASH FLOW IS USED BY US PRIMARILY FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING DEBT REPAYMENTS, DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. FREE CASH FLOW IS NOT A MEASURE OF CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES SINCE WE HAVE CERTAIN NON-DISCRETIONARY OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS DEBT SERVICE THAT ARE NOT DEDUCTED FROM THE MEASURE.

MARK-TO-MARKET NET IMPACT  WE CENTRALLY MANAGE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES ON BEHALF OF OUR DIVISIONS.  THESE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES INCLUDE  AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, ENERGY AND METALS.  COMMODITY DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT ARE MARKED TO MARKET EACH PERIOD WITH THE RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES RECORDED IN CORPORATE UNALLOCATED EXPENSES AS EITHER COST OF SALES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, DEPENDING ON THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY. THESE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REFLECTED IN DIVISION RESULTS WHEN THE DIVISIONS RECOGNIZE THE COST OF THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY IN OPERATING PROFIT.  THEREFORE, THE DIVISIONS REALIZE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE DERIVATIVE WITHOUT EXPERIENCING ANY RESULTING MARK-TO-MARKET VOLATILITY, WHICH REMAINS IN CORPORATE UNALLOCATED EXPENSES.

WE EXPECT TO INCUR PRE-TAX CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019  , WITH THE BALANCE TO BE REFLECTED IN OUR FISCAL 2020 THROUGH 2023 RESULTS. THESE TOTAL PRE-TAX CHARGES ARE EXPECTED TO CONSIST OF APPROXIMATELY 70% OF SEVERANCE AND OTHER EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS, 15% FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENTS (ALL NON-CASH) RESULTING FROM PLANT CLOSURES AND RELATED ACTIONS, AND 15% FOR OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR INITIATIVES. WE EXPECT TO INCUR CASH EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION, OF WHICH WE HAVE INCURRED  $66 MILLION  TO DATE.

AS OF  JUNE 15, 2019  , WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH IN OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES OF $3.0 BILLION, INCLUDING RESTRICTED CASH HELD OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES OF APPROXIMATELY $0.1 BILLION RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF SODASTREAM. SEE NOTE 12 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF RESTRICTED CASH. AS OF  JUNE 15, 2019  , CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO CURRENCY CONTROLS OR CURRENCY EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS WERE NOT MATERIAL.  THE TCJ ACT IMPOSED A MANDATORY ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON UNDISTRIBUTED INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS. AS OF  JUNE 15, 2019  , OUR MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY WAS $3.4 BILLION. UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE TCJ ACT, THIS TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY MUST BE PAID OVER EIGHT YEARS. ANY ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE IRS MAY IMPACT OUR RECORDED AMOUNTS FOR THIS TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY. SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE TCJ ACT.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  24  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $1.4 BILLION  , COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF  $1.1 BILLION  IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE OPERATING CASH FLOW PERFORMANCE PRIMARILY REFLECTS DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS OF $1.6 BILLION TO OUR PENSION AND RETIREE MEDICAL PLANS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE NET WORKING CAPITAL COMPARISONS TO 2018 AND HIGHER NET CASH TAX PAYMENTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  24  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $3.3 BILLION  , PRIMARILY REFLECTING $1.9 BILLION OF CASH PAID IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF SODASTREAM, AS WELL AS NET CAPITAL SPENDING OF $1.1 BILLION.  WE EXPECT  2019  NET CAPITAL SPENDING TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $4.5 BILLION.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  24  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , NET CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $5.4 BILLION  , PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE RETURN OF OPERATING CASH FLOW TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES OF  $4.4 BILLION  AND PAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT BORROWINGS OF  $3.0 BILLION  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $1.1 BILLION  AND NET PROCEEDS OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS OF $0.7 BILLION.  WE ANNUALLY REVIEW OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE WITH OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, INCLUDING OUR DIVIDEND POLICY AND SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2018, WE ANNOUNCED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM PROVIDING FOR  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $15.0 BILLION OF PEPSICO COMMON STOCK WHICH COMMENCED ON JULY 1, 2018 AND WILL EXPIRE ON JUNE 30, 2021. IN ADDITION, ON FEBRUARY 15, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED A 3% INCREASE IN OUR ANNUALIZED DIVIDEND TO $3.82 PER SHARE FROM $3.71 PER SHARE, EFFECTIVE WITH THE DIVIDEND PAID IN JUNE 2019. WE EXPECT TO RETURN A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $8 BILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS IN  2019  THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY $3 BILLION AND DIVIDENDS OF APPROXIMATELY $5 BILLION.

THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES THERETO CONTAINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM  10-Q.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A MARYLAND CORPORATION  THAT HAS ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A BDC UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, AS AMENDED (THE \u201c1940 ACT\u201d). OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE ATTRACTIVE RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS BY GENERATING CURRENT INCOME AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL  APPRECIATION FROM OUR INVESTMENTS. WE INVEST PRIMARILY IN SENIOR AND UNITRANCHE LEVERAGED LOANS AND MEZZANINE DEBT ISSUED BY PRIVATE U.S.    MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES, WHICH WE DEFINE AS COMPANIES HAVING EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST,  TAX, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) OF BETWEEN $2 MILLION AND $50 MILLION, BOTH THROUGH DIRECT LENDING AND THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN LOAN SYNDICATES. WE MAY ALSO INVEST UP TO 30.0% OF THE PORTFOLIO IN OPPORTUNISTIC  INVESTMENTS IN ORDER TO SEEK TO ENHANCE RETURNS TO STOCKHOLDERS. SUCH INVESTMENTS MAY INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN DISTRESSED DEBT, WHICH MAY INCLUDE SECURITIES OF COMPANIES IN BANKRUPTCY, FOREIGN DEBT, PRIVATE EQUITY, SECURITIES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT  ARE NOT THINLY TRADED AND STRUCTURED FINANCE VEHICLES SUCH AS COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATION FUNDS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO CURRENT INTENTION TO DO SO, TO THE EXTENT WE INVEST IN PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, WE WILL LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES THAT ARE  EXCLUDED FROM THE DEFINITION OF \u201cINVESTMENT COMPANY\u201d UNDER SECTION 3(C)(1) OR SECTION 3(C)(7) OF THE 1940 ACT, WHICH INCLUDES PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, TO NO MORE THAN 15.0% OF ITS NET ASSETS. WE HAVE ELECTED AND QUALIFIED TO BE  TREATED AS A RIC UNDER SUBCHAPTER M OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE \u201cCODE\u201d).  CORPORATE HISTORY AND RECENT  DEVELOPMENTS  WE COMMENCED OPERATIONS, AT THE TIME KNOWN AS GSC INVESTMENT CORP., ON MARCH 23, 2007 AND COMPLETED AN INITIAL  PUBLIC OFFERING OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ON MARCH 28, 2007. PRIOR TO JULY 30, 2010, WE WERE EXTERNALLY MANAGED AND ADVISED BY GSCP (NJ), L.P., AN ENTITY AFFILIATED WITH GSC GROUP, INC. IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSUMMATION OF A  RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTION ON JULY 30, 2010, AS DESCRIBED BELOW WE ENGAGED SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS (\u201cSIA\u201d) TO REPLACE GSCP (NJ), L.P. AS OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER AND CHANGED OUR NAME TO SARATOGA INVESTMENT CORP.  AS A RESULT OF THE EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER A REVOLVING SECURITIZED CREDIT FACILITY WITH DEUTSCHE BANK WE PREVIOUSLY HAD IN PLACE, IN DECEMBER  2008 WE ENGAGED THE INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM OF STIFEL, NICOLAUS &  77  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMPANY TO EVALUATE STRATEGIC TRANSACTION OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES FOR US. ON APRIL 14, 2010, GSC INVESTMENT CORP. ENTERED INTO A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH SARATOGA  INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES AND AN ASSIGNMENT, ASSUMPTION AND NOVATION AGREEMENT WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, PURSUANT TO WHICH GSC INVESTMENT CORP. ASSUMED CERTAIN RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS  UNDER A DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS RECEIVED FROM MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC, WHICH INDICATED MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING\u2019S WILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE GSC INVESTMENT CORP. WITH A $40.0 MILLION SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING  CREDIT FACILITY, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, GSC INVESTMENT CORP. AND GSCP (NJ), L.P. ENTERED INTO A TERMINATION AND RELEASE AGREEMENT, TO BE EFFECTIVE AS OF THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED  BY THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO WHICH GSCP (NJ), L.P., AMONG OTHER THINGS, AGREED TO WAIVE ANY AND ALL ACCRUED AND UNPAID DEFERRED INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEES UP TO AND AS OF THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THE STOCK  PURCHASE AGREEMENT BUT CONTINUED TO BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEES EARNED THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT.  ON JULY 30, 2010, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND CERTAIN OF ITS  AFFILIATES WERE COMPLETED, THE PRIVATE SALE OF 986,842 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR $15.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE TO SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES CLOSED, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO THE CREDIT FACILITY,  AND THE COMPANY BEGAN DOING BUSINESS AS SARATOGA INVESTMENT CORP.  WE USED THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE PRIVATE SALE TRANSACTION AND A  PORTION OF THE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO US UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY TO PAY THE FULL AMOUNT OF PRINCIPAL AND ACCRUED INTEREST, INCLUDING DEFAULT INTEREST, OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVING SECURITIZED CREDIT FACILITY WITH DEUTSCHE BANK. THE REVOLVING  SECURITIZED CREDIT FACILITY WITH DEUTSCHE BANK WAS TERMINATED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PAYMENT OF ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING THEREUNDER ON JULY 30, 2010.  ON AUGUST 12, 2010, WE EFFECTED A  ONE-FOR-TEN  REVERSE  STOCK SPLIT OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. AS A RESULT OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT, EVERY TEN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WERE CONVERTED INTO ONE SHARE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. ANY FRACTIONAL SHARES RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT WERE  REDEEMED FOR CASH. THE TOTAL CASH PAYMENT IN LIEU OF SHARES WAS $230. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT, WE HAD 2,680,842 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING.  IN JANUARY 2011, WE REGISTERED FOR PUBLIC RESALE OF THE 986,842 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ISSUED TO SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND CERTAIN  OF ITS AFFILIATES.

THIS REFINANCING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EXTENDED THE SARATOGA CLO REINVESTMENT PERIOD TO JANUARY 2021, AND EXTENDED ITS LEGAL MATURITY TO JANUARY 2030. A  NON-CALL  PERIOD OF JANUARY 2020 WAS ALSO ADDED. IN ADDITION TO AND AS PART OF THE REFINANCING, THE SARATOGA CLO HAS ALSO BEEN UPSIZED FROM $300 MILLION IN ASSETS TO APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION. AS PART OF  THIS REFINANCING AND UPSIZING, THE COMPANY INVESTED AN ADDITIONAL $13.8 MILLION IN ALL OF THE NEWLY ISSUED SUBORDINATED NOTES OF THE SARATOGA CLO, AND PURCHASED $2.5 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE  CLASS F-R-2  NOTES TRANCHE AND $7.5 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE  CLASS G-R-2  NOTES TRANCHE AT PAR. CONCURRENTLY, THE EXISTING $4.5 MILLION OF CLASS F NOTES WERE REPAID.  ON FEBRUARY 5, 2019, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A  RE-OPENING  AND  UP-SIZING  OF ITS EXISTING 2025 NOTES BY ISSUING AN ADDITIONAL $20.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $19.2 MILLION AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING COMMISSIONS OF APPROXIMATELY  $0.6 MILLION AND DISCOUNT OF $0.2 MILLION. OFFERING COSTS INCURRED WERE APPROXIMATELY $0.2 MILLION. THE ISSUANCE INCLUDED THE FULL EXERCISE OF THE UNDERWRITERS\u2019 OPTION TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL $2.5 MILLION AGGREGATE  PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2025 NOTES WITHIN 30 DAYS. INTEREST RATE, INTEREST PAYMENT DATES AND MATURITY REMAIN UNCHANGED FROM THE EXISTING 2025 NOTES ISSUED IN AUGUST 2018. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THIS OFFERING WERE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES IN  ACCORDANCE WITH OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGIES. THE FINANCING COSTS AND DISCOUNT OF $1.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE 2025 NOTES HAVE BEEN CAPITALIZED AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE 2025 NOTES.  AT MAY 31, 2019, THE TOTAL 2025 NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $60.0 MILLION. THE 2025 NOTES ARE LISTED ON THE NYSE UNDER THE TRADING SYMBOL  \u201cSAF\u201d WITH A PAR VALUE OF $25.00 PER SHARE.  79  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  BASIS OF PRESENTATION  THE  PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECTING AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED INVESTMENT VALUATION, REVENUE RECOGNITION AND THE RECOGNITION OF CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE EXPENSE AS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES. WE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED  TO THE MATTERS DESCRIBED BELOW. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO US AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM  THOSE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. A DISCUSSION OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOLLOWS.  INVESTMENT VALUATION  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD  (\u201cFASB\u201d) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 820,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURES  (\u201cASC 820\u201d). ASC 820 DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FAIR  VALUE HIERARCHY BASED ON THE QUALITY OF INPUTS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE AND ENHANCES DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. ASC 820 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO ASSUME THAT ITS INVESTMENTS ARE TO BE SOLD OR ITS LIABILITIES ARE TO BE  TRANSFERRED AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE IN THE PRINCIPAL MARKET TO INDEPENDENT MARKET PARTICIPANTS, OR IN THE ABSENCE OF A PRINCIPAL MARKET, IN THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET, WHICH MAY BE A HYPOTHETICAL MARKET. MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE DEFINED AS BUYERS  AND SELLERS IN THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET THAT ARE INDEPENDENT, KNOWLEDGEABLE, AND WILLING AND ABLE TO TRANSACT.  INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE READILY AVAILABLE ARE FAIR VALUED AT SUCH MARKET QUOTATIONS OBTAINED FROM INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY  PRICING SERVICES AND MARKET MAKERS SUBJECT TO ANY DECISION BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO APPROVE A FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION TO REFLECT SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFFECTING THE VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS. WE VALUE INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE  NOT READILY AVAILABLE AT FAIR VALUE AS APPROVED, IN GOOD FAITH, BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS BASED ON INPUT FROM SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND A THIRD PARTY INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM. DETERMINATIONS OF  FAIR VALUE MAY INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES. THE TYPES OF FACTORS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS INCLUDE THE NATURE AND REALIZABLE VALUE OF ANY COLLATERAL, THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY  TO MAKE PAYMENTS, MARKET YIELD TREND ANALYSIS, THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY DOES BUSINESS, COMPARISON TO PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS.  WE UNDERTAKE A MULTI-STEP VALUATION PROCESS EACH QUARTER WHEN VALUING INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE, AS  DESCRIBED BELOW.  \u2022  EACH INVESTMENT IS INITIALLY VALUED BY THE RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS OF SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS  AND PRELIMINARY VALUATION CONCLUSIONS ARE DOCUMENTED AND DISCUSSED WITH OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT; AND  \u2022  AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM ENGAGED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWS A SELECTION OF THESE  PRELIMINARY VALUATIONS EACH QUARTER SO THAT THE VALUATION OF EACH INVESTMENT FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE IS REVIEWED BY THE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM AT LEAST ONCE EACH FISCAL YEAR. WE USE A PARTY INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM TO  VALUE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE SUBORDINATED NOTES OF SARATOGA CLO AND THE  CLASS F-R-2  NOTES AND  CLASS G-R-2  NOTES TRANCHES OF THE SARATOGA CLOS EVERY QUARTER.  IN ADDITION, ALL OUR INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING VALUATION PROCESS.  \u2022  THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEWS AND APPROVES EACH PRELIMINARY VALUATION AND SARATOGA  INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM (IF APPLICABLE) WILL SUPPLEMENT THE PRELIMINARY VALUATION TO REFLECT ANY COMMENTS PROVIDED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE; AND  80  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSES THE VALUATIONS AND APPROVES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH INVESTMENT, IN GOOD FAITH,  BASED ON THE INPUT OF SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM (TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE) AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS BASED ON A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT UTILIZES PREPAYMENT,  RE-  INVESTMENT AND LOSS ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND PROJECTED PERFORMANCE, ECONOMIC FACTORS, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING CASH FLOW, AND COMPARABLE YIELDS FOR EQUITY INTERESTS IN  COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATION FUNDS SIMILAR TO SARATOGA CLO, WHEN AVAILABLE, AS DETERMINED BY SIA AND RECOMMENDED TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. SPECIFICALLY, WE USE INTEX CASH FLOW MODELS, OR AN APPROPRIATE SUBSTITUTE, TO FORM THE BASIS FOR THE  VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO. THE MODELS USE A SET OF ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING PROJECTED DEFAULT RATES, RECOVERY RATES, REINVESTMENT RATE AND PREPAYMENT RATES IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT ESTIMATED VALUATIONS. THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON  AVAILABLE MARKET DATA AND PROJECTIONS PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES. WE USE THE OUTPUT FROM THE INTEX MODELS (I.E., THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS) TO PERFORM A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO  DETERMINE A VALUATION FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  INCOME RECOGNITION  INTEREST INCOME,  ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUM AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNT, IS RECORDED ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. THE COMPANY STOPS ACCRUING INTEREST ON ITS INVESTMENTS WHEN IT IS DETERMINED THAT INTEREST  IS NO LONGER COLLECTIBLE. DISCOUNTS AND PREMIUMS ON INVESTMENTS PURCHASED ARE ACCRETED/AMORTIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE RESPECTIVE INVESTMENT USING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD. THE AMORTIZED COST OF INVESTMENTS REPRESENTS THE ORIGINAL COST ADJUSTED FOR  THE ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS AND AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS ON INVESTMENTS.  LOANS ARE GENERALLY PLACED ON  NON-ACCRUAL  STATUS WHEN THERE IS REASONABLE DOUBT THAT PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST WILL BE COLLECTED. ACCRUED INTEREST IS GENERALLY RESERVED WHEN A LOAN IS PLACED ON  NON-ACCRUAL  STATUS. INTEREST PAYMENTS RECEIVED ON  NON-ACCRUAL  LOANS MAY BE RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION IN PRINCIPAL DEPENDING UPON MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT REGARDING  COLLECTABILITY.  NON-ACCRUAL  LOANS ARE RESTORED TO ACCRUAL STATUS WHEN PAST DUE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS PAID AND, IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT, ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN CURRENT, ALTHOUGH WE MAY MAKE EXCEPTIONS  TO THIS GENERAL RULE IF THE LOAN HAS SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL VALUE AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION.  PAYMENT-IN-KIND  INTEREST  THE COMPANY HOLDS DEBT AND PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN ITS  PORTFOLIO THAT CONTAIN A  PAYMENT-IN-KIND  (\u201cPIK\u201d) INTEREST PROVISION.  THE PIK INTEREST, WHICH REPRESENTS CONTRACTUALLY DEFERRED INTEREST ADDED TO THE INVESTMENT BALANCE THAT IS GENERALLY DUE AT MATURITY, IS  GENERALLY RECORDED ON THE ACCRUAL BASIS TO THE EXTENT SUCH AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. WE STOP ACCRUING PIK INTEREST IF WE DO NOT EXPECT THE ISSUER TO BE ABLE TO PAY ALL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WHEN DUE.  REVENUES  WE GENERATE REVENUE IN  THE FORM OF INTEREST INCOME AND CAPITAL GAINS ON THE DEBT INVESTMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, ON EQUITY INTERESTS THAT WE MAY ACQUIRE. WE EXPECT OUR DEBT INVESTMENTS, WHETHER IN THE FORM OF LEVERAGED LOANS OR MEZZANINE DEBT, TO HAVE  TERMS OF UP TO TEN YEARS, AND TO BEAR INTEREST AT EITHER A FIXED OR FLOATING RATE. INTEREST ON DEBT WILL BE PAYABLE GENERALLY EITHER QUARTERLY OR SEMI-ANNUALLY. IN SOME CASES, OUR DEBT OR PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR A PORTION OR ALL  OF THE INTEREST TO BE PIK. TO THE EXTENT INTEREST IS PIK, IT WILL BE PAYABLE THROUGH THE INCREASE OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE OBLIGATION BY THE AMOUNT OF  81  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST DUE ON THE THEN-OUTSTANDING AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SUCH OBLIGATION. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE DEBT AND ANY ACCRUED BUT UNPAID INTEREST WILL GENERALLY BECOME DUE AT THE MATURITY  DATE. IN ADDITION, WE MAY GENERATE REVENUE IN THE FORM OF COMMITMENT, ORIGINATION, STRUCTURING OR DILIGENCE FEES, FEES FOR PROVIDING MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE OR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND POSSIBLY CONSULTING FEES. ANY SUCH FEES WILL BE  GENERATED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INVESTMENTS AND RECOGNIZED AS EARNED. WE MAY ALSO INVEST IN PREFERRED EQUITY OR COMMON EQUITY SECURITIES THAT PAY DIVIDENDS ON A CURRENT BASIS.  ON JANUARY 22, 2008, WE ENTERED INTO A COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH SARATOGA CLO, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE ACT AS ITS COLLATERAL  MANAGER. THE SARATOGA CLO WAS INITIALLY REFINANCED IN OCTOBER 2013 WITH ITS REINVESTMENT PERIOD EXTENDED TO OCTOBER 2016. ON NOVEMBER 15, 2016, WE COMPLETED A SECOND REFINANCING OF THE SARATOGA CLO WITH ITS REINVESTMENT PERIOD EXTENDED TO  OCTOBER 2018.  ON DECEMBER 14, 2018, WE COMPLETED A THIRD REFINANCING AND UPSIZE OF THE SARATOGA CLO. THE THIRD SARATOGA CLO  REFINANCING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EXTENDED ITS REINVESTMENT PERIOD TO JANUARY 2021, AND EXTENDED ITS LEGAL MATURITY DATE TO JANUARY 2030. A  NON-CALL  PERIOD OF JANUARY 2020 WAS ALSO ADDED. FOLLOWING THIS  REFINANCING, THE SARATOGA CLO PORTFOLIO INCREASED FROM APPROXIMATELY $300.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT TO APPROXIMATELY $500.0 MILLION OF PREDOMINANTLY SENIOR SECURED FIRST LIEN TERM LOANS. IN ADDITION TO REFINANCING ITS  LIABILITIES, WE INVESTED AN ADDITIONAL $13.8 MILLION IN ALL OF THE NEWLY ISSUED SUBORDINATED NOTES OF THE SARATOGA CLO AND ALSO PURCHASED $2.5 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE  CLASS F-R-2  AND $7.5 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE  CLASS G-R-2  NOTES TRANCHES AT PAR, WITH A  COUPON OF LIBOR PLUS 8.75% AND LIBOR PLUS 10.00%, RESPECTIVELY. AS PART OF THIS REFINANCING, WE ALSO REDEEMED OUR EXISTING $4.5 MILLION AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE CLASS F NOTES TRANCHE AT PAR.  THE SARATOGA CLO REMAINS EFFECTIVELY 100% OWNED AND MANAGED BY SARATOGA INVESTMENT CORP. WE RECEIVE A BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.10% PER ANNUM  AND A SUBORDINATED MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.40% PER ANNUM OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SARATOGA CLO\u2019S ASSETS, PAID QUARTERLY TO THE EXTENT OF AVAILABLE PROCEEDS. PRIOR TO THE SECOND REFINANCING AND THE ISSUANCE OF THE  2013-1  AMENDED CLO NOTES, WE RECEIVED A BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.25% PER ANNUM AND A SUBORDINATED MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.25% PER ANNUM OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SARATOGA CLO\u2019S ASSETS, PAID QUARTERLY  TO THE EXTENT OF AVAILABLE PROCEEDS.  FOLLOWING THE THIRD REFINANCING AND THE ISSUANCE OF THE  2013-1  RESET CLO NOTES ON DECEMBER 14, 2018, WE ARE NO LONGER ENTITLED TO AN INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE EQUAL TO 20.0% OF EXCESS CASH FLOW TO THE EXTENT THE SARATOGA CLO SUBORDINATED NOTES RECEIVE AN  INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN PAID IN CASH EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 12.0%.  INTEREST INCOME ON OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO IS RECORDED USING  THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ASC TOPIC  325-40,  INVESTMENTS-OTHER, BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS  (\u201cASC  325-40\u201d),  BASED ON THE ANTICIPATED YIELD AND THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS OVER THE PROJECTED LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT. YIELDS ARE REVISED WHEN THERE ARE CHANGES IN ACTUAL OR ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS DUE TO CHANGES  IN PREPAYMENTS AND/OR  RE-INVESTMENTS,  CREDIT LOSSES OR ASSET PRICING. CHANGES IN ESTIMATED YIELD ARE RECOGNIZED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE ESTIMATED YIELD OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT FROM THE DATE  THE ESTIMATED YIELD WAS CHANGED.  ASC 606  IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ASU  2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (\u201cASC  606\u201d), WHICH SUPERSEDES THE REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS IN REVENUE RECOGNITION (ASC 605). UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT  REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN MAY 2016, ASU  2016-12  AMENDED ASU  2014-09  AND DEFERRED  THE EFFECTIVE PERIOD FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017. MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE MAJORITY OF ITS REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE SCOPED OUT OF ASC 606, AND HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT  IMPACT RELATES TO THE TIMING OF THE RECOGNITION OF THE CLO INCENTIVE FEE INCOME. WE ADOPTED ASC 606 UNDER THE MODIFIED  82  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH USING THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT PROVIDED FOR, THEREFORE THE PRESENTATION OF PRIOR PERIODS HAS NOT BEEN ADJUSTED.  EXPENSES  OUR PRIMARY OPERATING  EXPENSES INCLUDE THE PAYMENT OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT FEES, PROFESSIONAL FEES, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INSURANCE, FEES PAID TO INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND ADMINISTRATOR EXPENSES, INCLUDING OUR ALLOCABLE PORTION OF OUR ADMINISTRATOR\u2019S  OVERHEAD. OUR INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT FEES COMPENSATE OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER FOR ITS WORK IN IDENTIFYING, EVALUATING, NEGOTIATING, CLOSING AND MONITORING OUR INVESTMENTS. WE BEAR ALL OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES OF OUR OPERATIONS AND  TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO.  \u2022  ORGANIZATION;  \u2022  CALCULATING OUR NET ASSET VALUE (INCLUDING THE COST AND EXPENSES OF ANY INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM);  \u2022  EXPENSES INCURRED BY OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING AGENTS, CONSULTANTS OR OTHER  ADVISERS, IN MONITORING OUR FINANCIAL AND LEGAL AFFAIRS AND IN MONITORING OUR INVESTMENTS AND PERFORMING DUE DILIGENCE ON OUR PROSPECTIVE PORTFOLIO COMPANIES;  \u2022  EXPENSES INCURRED BY OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER PAYABLE FOR TRAVEL AND DUE DILIGENCE ON OUR PROSPECTIVE PORTFOLIO  COMPANIES;  \u2022  INTEREST PAYABLE ON DEBT, IF ANY, INCURRED TO FINANCE OUR INVESTMENTS;  \u2022  OFFERINGS OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES;  \u2022  INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT FEES;  \u2022  FEES PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING AGENTS, CONSULTANTS OR OTHER ADVISERS, RELATING TO, OR ASSOCIATED WITH,  EVALUATING AND MAKING INVESTMENTS;  \u2022  TRANSFER AGENT AND CUSTODIAL FEES;  \u2022  FEDERAL AND STATE REGISTRATION FEES;  \u2022  ALL COSTS OF REGISTRATION AND LISTING OUR COMMON STOCK ON ANY SECURITIES EXCHANGE;  \u2022  FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES;  \u2022  INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS\u2019 FEES AND EXPENSES;  \u2022  COSTS OF PREPARING AND FILING REPORTS OR OTHER DOCUMENTS REQUIRED BY GOVERNMENTAL BODIES (INCLUDING THE U.S.  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) AND THE SBA);  \u2022  COSTS OF ANY REPORTS, PROXY STATEMENTS OR OTHER NOTICES TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDING PRINTING COSTS;  \u2022  OUR FIDELITY BOND, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS ERRORS AND OMISSIONS LIABILITY INSURANCE, AND ANY OTHER INSURANCE  PREMIUMS;  \u2022  DIRECT COSTS AND EXPENSES OF ADMINISTRATION, INCLUDING PRINTING, MAILING, LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE, COPYING,  SECRETARIAL AND OTHER STAFF, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS AND OUTSIDE LEGAL COSTS; AND  \u2022  ADMINISTRATION FEES AND ALL OTHER EXPENSES INCURRED BY US OR, IF APPLICABLE, THE ADMINISTRATOR IN CONNECTION WITH  ADMINISTERING OUR BUSINESS (INCLUDING PAYMENTS UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT BASED UPON OUR ALLOCABLE PORTION OF THE ADMINISTRATOR\u2019S OVERHEAD IN PERFORMING ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER AN ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT, INCLUDING RENT AND THE ALLOCABLE  PORTION OF THE COST OF OUR OFFICERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE STAFFS (INCLUDING TRAVEL EXPENSES)).  PURSUANT TO THE INVESTMENT  ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT THAT WE HAD WITH GSCP (NJ), L.P., OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER AND ADMINISTRATOR, WE HAD AGREED TO PAY GSCP (NJ), L.P. AS INVESTMENT ADVISER A  83  TABLE OF CONTENTS  QUARTERLY BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OF 1.75% OF THE AVERAGE VALUE OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS (OTHER THAN CASH OR CASH EQUIVALENTS BUT INCLUDING ASSETS PURCHASED WITH BORROWED FUNDS) AT THE END OF THE TWO MOST  RECENTLY COMPLETED FISCAL QUARTERS AND AN INCENTIVE FEE.  THE INCENTIVE FEE HAD TWO PARTS.  \u2022  A FEE, PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ARREARS, EQUAL TO 20.0% OF OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPRESSED AS A RATE OF RETURN ON THE VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS AT THE END OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING QUARTER, THAT EXCEEDED A 1.875% QUARTERLY HURDLE RATE MEASURED AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER. UNDER THIS  PROVISION, IN ANY FISCAL QUARTER, OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER RECEIVED NO INCENTIVE FEE UNLESS OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME EXCEEDED THE HURDLE RATE OF 1.875%. AMOUNTS RECEIVED AS A RETURN OF CAPITAL  WERE NOT INCLUDED IN CALCULATING THIS PORTION OF THE INCENTIVE FEE. SINCE THE HURDLE RATE WAS BASED ON NET ASSETS, A RETURN OF LESS THAN THE HURDLE RATE ON TOTAL ASSETS COULD STILL HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCENTIVE FEE.  \u2022  A FEE, PAYABLE AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, EQUAL TO 20.0% OF OUR NET REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, COMPUTED  NET OF ALL REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES AND UNREALIZED CAPITAL DEPRECIATION, IN EACH CASE ON A CUMULATIVE BASIS ON EACH INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY\u2019S PORTFOLIO, LESS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEES PAID TO THE INVESTMENT ADVISER  THROUGH SUCH DATE.  WE DEFERRED CASH PAYMENT OF ANY INCENTIVE FEE OTHERWISE EARNED BY OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER IF,  DURING THE THEN MOST RECENT FOUR FULL FISCAL QUARTERS ENDING ON OR PRIOR TO THE DATE SUCH PAYMENT WAS TO BE MADE, THE SUM OF (A) OUR AGGREGATE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND (B) OUR CHANGE IN NET ASSETS (DEFINED AS TOTAL ASSETS LESS  LIABILITIES) (BEFORE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY INCENTIVE FEES PAYABLE DURING THAT PERIOD) WAS LESS THAN 7.5% OF OUR NET ASSETS AT THE BEGINNING OF SUCH PERIOD. THESE CALCULATIONS WERE APPROPRIATELY  PRO-RATED  FOR  THE FIRST THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF OPERATION AND ADJUSTED FOR ANY SHARE ISSUANCES OR REPURCHASES DURING THE APPLICABLE PERIOD. SUCH INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BECOME PAYABLE ON THE NEXT DATE ON WHICH SUCH TEST HAD BEEN SATISFIED FOR THE MOST RECENT FOUR  FULL FISCAL QUARTERS OR UPON CERTAIN TERMINATIONS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. WE COMMENCED DEFERRING CASH PAYMENT OF INCENTIVE FEES DURING THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2007 AND CONTINUED TO DEFER SUCH PAYMENTS  THROUGH THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2010. AS OF JULY 30, 2010, THE DATE ON WHICH GSCP (NJ), L.P. CEASED TO BE OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER AND ADMINISTRATOR, WE OWED GSCP (NJ), L.P. $2.9 MILLION IN FEES FOR SERVICES PREVIOUSLY  PROVIDED TO US; OF WHICH $0.3 MILLION HAS BEEN PAID BY US. GSCP (NJ), L.P. AGREED TO WAIVE PAYMENT BY US OF THE REMAINING $2.6 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSUMMATION OF THE STOCK PURCHASE TRANSACTION WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS  AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT.  THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT  WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT ADVISER, ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WE HAD ENTERED INTO WITH GSCP (NJ), L.P., OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER, EXCEPT FOR THE  FOLLOWING MATERIAL DISTINCTIONS IN THE FEE TERMS.  \u2022  THE CAPITAL GAINS PORTION OF THE INCENTIVE FEE WAS RESET WITH RESPECT TO GAINS AND LOSSES FROM MAY 31, 2010,  AND THEREFORE LOSSES AND GAINS INCURRED PRIOR TO SUCH TIME WILL NOT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN CALCULATING THE CAPITAL GAINS FEE PAYABLE TO SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND, AS A RESULT, SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS WILL BE ENTITLED TO 20.0% OF NET  GAINS THAT ARISE AFTER MAY 31, 2010. IN ADDITION, THE COST BASIS FOR COMPUTING REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS HELD BY US AS OF MAY 31, 2010 EQUAL THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENT AS OF SUCH DATE. UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY  AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER, GSCP (NJ), L.P., THE CAPITAL GAINS FEE WAS CALCULATED FROM MARCH 21, 2007, AND THE GAINS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY OUTWEIGHED BY LOSSES.  \u2022  UNDER THE \u201cCATCH UP\u201d PROVISION, 100.0% OF OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE  NET INVESTMENT INCOME WITH RESPECT TO THAT PORTION OF SUCH  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME THAT EXCEEDS 1.875% BUT IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 2.344% IN ANY FISCAL QUARTER IS PAYABLE TO SARATOGA  INVESTMENT ADVISORS. THIS WILL ENABLE SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS TO RECEIVE 20.0% OF ALL NET INVESTMENT INCOME AS SUCH AMOUNT  84  TABLE OF CONTENTS  APPROACHES 2.344% IN ANY QUARTER, AND SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS WILL RECEIVE 20.0% OF ANY ADDITIONAL NET INVESTMENT INCOME. UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR  FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER, GSCP (NJ), L.P. ONLY RECEIVED 20.0% OF THE EXCESS NET INVESTMENT INCOME OVER 1.875%.  \u2022  WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE DEFERRAL RIGHTS REGARDING INCENTIVE FEES IN THE EVENT THAT THE DISTRIBUTIONS TO  STOCKHOLDERS AND CHANGE IN NET ASSETS IS LESS THAN 7.5% FOR THE PRECEDING FOUR FISCAL QUARTERS.  CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE  THE COMPANY RECORDS AN EXPENSE ACCRUAL RELATING TO THE CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE PAYABLE BY THE COMPANY TO ITS MANAGER WHEN THE UNREALIZED  GAINS ON ITS INVESTMENTS EXCEED ALL REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES ON ITS INVESTMENTS GIVEN THE FACT THAT A CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BE OWED TO THE MANAGER IF THE COMPANY WERE TO LIQUIDATE ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT SUCH TIME. THE ACTUAL  INCENTIVE FEE PAYABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGER RELATED TO CAPITAL GAINS WILL BE DETERMINED AND PAYABLE IN ARREARS AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR AND WILL INCLUDE ONLY REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS FOR THE PERIOD.  REGULATORY MATTERS  IN AUGUST 2018, THE  SEC ISSUED FINAL RULE RELEASE  NO.33-10532,  DISCLOSURE UPDATE AND SIMPLIFICATION  , WHICH IN PART AMENDS CERTAIN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF REGULATION  S-X  THAT HAVE  BECOME REDUNDANT, DUPLICATIVE, OVERLAPPING, OUTDATED, OR SUPERSEDED, IN LIGHT OF OTHER COMMISSION DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, U.S. GAAP OR CHANGES IN THE INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT. THE AMENDMENTS ARE INTENDED TO FACILITATE THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION  TO INVESTORS AND SIMPLIFY COMPLIANCE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERING THE TOTAL MIX OF INFORMATION PROVIDED TO INVESTORS. THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR THESE DISCLOSURES WAS NOVEMBER 5, 2018, EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER THAT BEGINS AFTER THE  EFFECTIVE DATE. MANAGEMENT HAS ADOPTED THESE AMENDMENTS AS CURRENTLY REQUIRED AND THESE ARE REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. THE PRESENTATION OF CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR INFORMATION HAS BEEN  ADJUSTED TO CONFORM WITH THESE AMENDMENTS.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN AUGUST 2018, FASB ISSUED ASU  2018-13  , FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820): DISCLOSURE  FRAMEWORK\u2014CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  (\u201cASU  2018-13\u201d).  THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF ASU  2018-13  IS TO IMPROVE THE  EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE CHANGES AFFECT ALL COMPANIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT DISCLOSURES. IN GENERAL, THE AMENDMENTS IN ASU  2018-13  ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL ENTITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019. AN ENTITY IS PERMITTED TO EARLY ADOPT THE REMOVED OR MODIFIED  DISCLOSURES UPON THE ISSUANCE OF ASU  2018-13  AND MAY DELAY ADOPTION OF THE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, WHICH ARE REQUIRED FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES ONLY, UNTIL THEIR EFFECTIVE DATE. MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THESE  CHANGES AND DOES NOT BELIEVE THEY WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES.  IN MARCH 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU  2017-08,  RECEIVABLES \u2014 NONREFUNDABLE FEES AND OTHER COSTS  (SUBTOPIC  310-20),  PREMIUM AMORTIZATION ON PURCHASED CALLABLE DEBT SECURITIES  (\u201cASU  2017-08\u201d)  WHICH AMENDS THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR CERTAIN PURCHASED  CALLABLE DEBT SECURITIES HELD AT A PREMIUM, SHORTENING SUCH PERIOD TO THE EARLIEST CALL DATE. ASU  2017-08  DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY ACCOUNTING CHANGE FOR DEBT SECURITIES HELD AT A DISCOUNT; THE DISCOUNT CONTINUES  TO BE AMORTIZED TO MATURITY. ASU  2017-08  IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THESE CHANGES AND  CONCLUDED THESE CHANGES DO NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES.  85  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW  MAY 31, 2019  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  ($ IN MILLIONS)  NUMBER OF INVESTMENTS(1)  66  58  NUMBER OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES(2)  33  31  AVERAGE INVESTMENT PER PORTFOLIO COMPANY(2)  $11.3  $11.8  AVERAGE INVESTMENT SIZE(1)  $5.8  $6.5  WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY(3)  3.5YRS  3.6YRS  NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES  8  8  NON-PERFORMING  OR DELINQUENT INVESTMENTS (FAIR  VALUE)  $4.8  $5.7  FIXED RATE DEBT (% OF INTEREST EARNING PORTFOLIO)(3)  $56.8(16.7%)  $55.7(16.3%)  FIXED RATE DEBT (WEIGHTED AVERAGE CURRENT COUPON)(3)  10.4%  10.4%  FLOATING RATE DEBT (% OF INTEREST EARNING PORTFOLIO)(3)  $284.0(83.3%)  $285.0(83.7%)  FLOATING RATE DEBT (WEIGHTED AVERAGE CURRENT SPREAD OVER LIBOR)(3)(4)  8.5%  8.6%  (1)  EXCLUDES OUR INVESTMENT IN THE SUBORDINATED NOTES OF SARATOGA CLO.

IN ADDITION, WE INTEND TO DISTRIBUTE TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME IN  ORDER TO SATISFY THE DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT APPLICABLE TO RICS UNDER THE CODE. IN SATISFYING THIS DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT, WE HAVE IN THE PAST RELIED ON INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (\u201cIRS\u201d) ISSUED PRIVATE LETTER RULINGS CONCLUDING THAT A  RIC MAY TREAT A DISTRIBUTION OF ITS OWN STOCK AS FULFILLING ITS RIC DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS IF EACH STOCKHOLDER MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE HIS OR HER ENTIRE DISTRIBUTION IN EITHER CASH OR STOCK OF THE RIC SUBJECT TO A LIMITATION ON THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT  OF CASH TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH LIMITATION MUST BE AT LEAST 20.0% OF THE AGGREGATE DECLARED DISTRIBUTION. WE MAY RELY ON THESE IRS PRIVATE LETTER RULINGS IN FUTURE PERIODS TO SATISFY OUR RIC DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT.  ALSO, AS A BDC, WE GENERALLY ARE REQUIRED TO MEET A COVERAGE RATIO OF TOTAL ASSETS, LESS LIABILITIES AND INDEBTEDNESS NOT REPRESENTED BY  SENIOR SECURITIES, TO TOTAL SENIOR SECURITIES, WHICH INCLUDE ALL OF OUR BORROWINGS AND ANY OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK, OF AT LEAST 200.0%, REDUCED TO 150.0% EFFECTIVE APRIL 16, 2019 FOLLOWING THE APPROVAL RECEIVED FROM THE  NON-INTERESTED  BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON APRIL 16, 2018. THIS REQUIREMENT LIMITS THE AMOUNT THAT WE MAY BORROW. OUR ASSET COVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN THE 1940 ACT, WAS 238.9% AS OF MAY 31, 2019 AND 234.5% AS  OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019. TO FUND GROWTH IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IN THE FUTURE, WE ANTICIPATE NEEDING TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FROM VARIOUS SOURCES, INCLUDING THE EQUITY MARKETS AND OTHER DEBT-RELATED MARKETS, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE  AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL.  CONSEQUENTLY, WE MAY NOT HAVE THE FUNDS OR THE ABILITY TO FUND NEW INVESTMENTS, TO MAKE  ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, TO FUND OUR UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO PORTFOLIO COMPANIES OR TO REPAY BORROWINGS. ALSO, THE ILLIQUIDITY OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO SELL THESE INVESTMENTS WHEN DESIRED  AND, IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO SELL THESE INVESTMENTS, WE MAY REALIZE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THEIR RECORDED VALUE.  MADISON REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF THE TERMS OF THE SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WE ENTERED INTO WITH MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC  (THE \u201cCREDIT FACILITY\u201d) ON JUNE 30, 2010, WHICH WAS MOST RECENTLY AMENDED ON MAY 18, 2017.  AVAILABILITY.  THE  COMPANY CAN DRAW UP TO THE LESSER OF (I) $40.0 MILLION (THE \u201cFACILITY AMOUNT\u201d) AND (II) THE PRODUCT OF THE APPLICABLE ADVANCE RATE (WHICH VARIES FROM 50.0% TO 75.0% DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF LOAN ASSET) AND THE VALUE, DETERMINED  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cADJUSTED BORROWING VALUE\u201d), OF CERTAIN  94  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d LOAN ASSETS PLEDGED AS SECURITY FOR THE LOAN (THE \u201cBORROWING BASE\u201d), IN EACH CASE LESS (A) THE AMOUNT OF ANY UNDRAWN FUNDING COMMITMENTS THE COMPANY HAS UNDER  ANY LOAN ASSET AND WHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY AMOUNTS IN THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT REFERRED TO BELOW (THE \u201cUNFUNDED EXPOSURE AMOUNT\u201d) AND OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS. EACH LOAN ASSET HELD BY THE COMPANY AS OF THE DATE ON WHICH THE CREDIT  FACILITY WAS CLOSED WAS VALUED AS OF THAT DATE AND EACH LOAN ASSET THAT THE COMPANY ACQUIRES AFTER SUCH DATE WILL BE VALUED AT THE LOWEST OF ITS FAIR VALUE, ITS FACE VALUE (EXCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST) AND THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR SUCH LOAN ASSET.  ADJUSTMENTS TO THE VALUE OF A LOAN ASSET WILL BE MADE TO REFLECT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN ITS FAIR VALUE, A DEFAULT BY THE OBLIGOR ON THE LOAN ASSET, INSOLVENCY OF THE OBLIGOR, ACCELERATION OF THE LOAN ASSET, AND CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS TO THE  TERMS OF THE LOAN ASSET.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPE OF LOAN ASSETS THAT ARE \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d TO BE INCLUDED  IN THE BORROWING BASE AND AS TO THE CONCENTRATION LEVEL OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF LOAN ASSETS IN THE BORROWING BASE SUCH AS RESTRICTIONS ON GEOGRAPHIC AND INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS, ASSET SIZE AND QUALITY, PAYMENT FREQUENCY, STATUS AND TERMS, AVERAGE  LIFE, AND COLLATERAL INTERESTS. IN ADDITION, IF AN ASSET IS TO REMAIN AN \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d LOAN ASSET, THE COMPANY MAY NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THE PAYMENT, AMORTIZATION, COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN OTHER TERMS OF THE LOAN ASSETS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE  ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT THAT WILL EITHER RESULT IN SUBORDINATION OF THE LOAN ASSET OR BE MATERIALLY ADVERSE TO THE LENDERS.  COLLATERAL.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY (OTHER THAN ASSETS HELD BY OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY) AND INCLUDES THE SUBORDINATED NOTES (\u201cCLO NOTES\u201d) ISSUED BY SARATOGA CLO AND THE COMPANY\u2019S RIGHTS  UNDER THE CLO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED BELOW).  INTEREST RATE AND FEES.  UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, FUNDS ARE BORROWED FROM  OR THROUGH CERTAIN LENDERS AT THE GREATER OF THE PREVAILING LIBOR RATE AND 1.00%, PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN OF 4.75%. AT THE COMPANY\u2019S OPTION, FUNDS MAY BE BORROWED BASED ON AN ALTERNATIVE BASE RATE, WHICH IN NO EVENT WILL BE LESS THAN 2.00%,  AND THE APPLICABLE MARGIN OVER SUCH ALTERNATIVE BASE RATE IS 3.75%. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PAYS THE LENDERS A COMMITMENT FEE OF 0.75% PER YEAR ON THE UNUSED AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE DURATION OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD (DEFINED BELOW).  ACCRUED INTEREST AND COMMITMENT FEES ARE PAYABLE MONTHLY. THE COMPANY WAS ALSO OBLIGATED TO PAY CERTAIN OTHER FEES TO THE LENDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING OF THE CREDIT FACILITY.  REVOLVING PERIOD AND MATURITY DATE.  THE COMPANY MAY MAKE AND REPAY BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS  FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cREVOLVING PERIOD\u201d). THE REVOLVING PERIOD MAY BE TERMINATED AT AN EARLIER TIME BY THE COMPANY OR, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, BY ACTION OF THE LENDERS OR AUTOMATICALLY. ALL  BORROWINGS AND OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY ARE DUE AND PAYABLE IN FULL FIVE YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD.  COLLATERAL TESTS.  IT IS A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO ANY BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY THAT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER  THE CREDIT FACILITY, AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE PROPOSED BORROWINGS, NOT EXCEED THE LESSER OF THE BORROWING BASE OR THE FACILITY AMOUNT (THE \u201cBORROWING BASE TEST\u201d). IN ADDITION TO SATISFYING THE BORROWING BASE TEST, THE FOLLOWING TESTS  MUST ALSO BE SATISFIED (TOGETHER WITH BORROWING BASE TEST, THE \u201cCOLLATERAL TESTS\u201d).  \u2022  INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO.  THE RATIO (EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE) OF INTEREST COLLECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO  PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS, LESS CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSES RELATING TO THE CREDIT FACILITY, TO ACCRUED INTEREST AND COMMITMENT FEES AND ANY BREAKAGE COSTS PAYABLE TO THE LENDERS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE LAST 6 PAYMENT PERIODS MUST EQUAL AT LEAST  175.0%.  \u2022  OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO.  THE RATIO (EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE) OF THE AGGREGATE ADJUSTED BORROWING  VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS PLUS THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN INELIGIBLE PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS AND THE CLO NOTES (IN EACH CASE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS) TO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY PLUS THE UNFUNDED  EXPOSURE AMOUNT MUST EQUAL AT LEAST 200.0%.  \u2022  WEIGHTED AVERAGE FMV TEST.  THE AGGREGATE ADJUSTED OR WEIGHTED VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN  ASSETS AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE AGGREGATE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS  95  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MUST BE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 72.0% AND 80.0% DURING THE  ONE-YEAR  PERIODS PRIOR TO THE FIRST AND SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE, RESPECTIVELY,  AND 85.0% AT ALL TIMES THEREAFTER.  THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO REQUIRES PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OR REPLACEMENT  OF PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S BREACH OF ITS REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY THAT PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS INCLUDED IN THE BORROWING BASE ARE \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d LOAN ASSETS. SUCH PAYMENTS OR REPLACEMENTS MUST EQUAL THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT  BY WHICH THE BORROWING BASE IS OVERSTATED AS A RESULT OF SUCH BREACH OR ANY DEFICIENCY UNDER THE COLLATERAL TESTS AT THE TIME OF REPAYMENT OR REPLACEMENT. COMPLIANCE WITH THE COLLATERAL TESTS IS ALSO A CONDITION TO THE DISCRETIONARY SALE OF PLEDGED  LOAN ASSETS BY THE COMPANY.  PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS.  DURING THE REVOLVING PERIOD, THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS PROVISIONS OF THE CREDIT  FACILITY REQUIRE, AFTER PAYMENT OF SPECIFIED FEES AND EXPENSES AND ANY NECESSARY FUNDING OF THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT, THAT COLLECTIONS OF PRINCIPAL FROM THE LOAN ASSETS AND, TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE ARE INSUFFICIENT, COLLECTIONS OF INTEREST  FROM THE LOAN ASSETS, BE APPLIED ON EACH PAYMENT DATE TO PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS IF THE BORROWING BASE TEST, THE OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO AND THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE MET. SIMILARLY, FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF  THE REVOLVING PERIOD, COLLECTIONS OF INTEREST ARE REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED, AFTER PAYMENT OF CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSES, TO CURE ANY DEFICIENCIES IN THE BORROWING BASE TEST, THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND THE OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO AS OF THE  RELEVANT PAYMENT DATE.  RESERVE ACCOUNT.  THE CREDIT FACILITY REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO SET ASIDE AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE SUM OF  ACCRUED INTEREST, COMMITMENT FEES AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES DUE AND PAYABLE ON THE NEXT SUCCEEDING THREE PAYMENT DATES (OR CORRESPONDING TO THREE PAYMENT PERIODS). IF FOR ANY MONTHLY PERIOD DURING WHICH FEES AND OTHER PAYMENTS ACCRUE, THE  AGGREGATE ADJUSTED BORROWING VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS WHICH DO NOT PAY CASH INTEREST AT LEAST QUARTERLY EXCEEDS 15.0% OF THE AGGREGATE ADJUSTED BORROWING VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY IS  REQUIRED TO SET ASIDE SUCH INTEREST AND FEES DUE AND PAYABLE ON THE NEXT SUCCEEDING SIX PAYMENT DATES. AMOUNTS IN THE RESERVE ACCOUNT CAN BE APPLIED SOLELY TO THE PAYMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES, COMMITMENT FEES, ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST AND  ANY BREAKAGE COSTS PAYABLE TO THE LENDERS.  UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT.  WITH RESPECT TO REVOLVER OR DELAYED DRAW LOAN ASSETS, THE  COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO SET ASIDE IN A DESIGNATED ACCOUNT (THE \u201cUNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT\u201d) 100.0% OF ITS OUTSTANDING AND UNDRAWN FUNDING COMMITMENTS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH LOAN ASSETS. THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT IS FUNDED AT THE TIME THE  COMPANY ACQUIRES A REVOLVER OR DELAYED DRAW LOAN ASSET AND REQUESTS A RELATED BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT IS FUNDED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PROCEEDS OF THE REQUESTED BORROWING AND OTHER COMPANY FUNDS, AND IF  FOR ANY REASON SUCH AMOUNTS ARE INSUFFICIENT, THROUGH APPLICATION OF THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENT PROVISIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  OPERATING  EXPENSES.  THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS PROVISION OF THE CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES FOR THE PAYMENT OF CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE COMPANY OUT OF COLLECTIONS ON PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST DURING THE REVOLVING PERIOD AND OUT OF COLLECTIONS ON INTEREST  FOLLOWING THE TERMINATION OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRIORITY ESTABLISHED IN SUCH PROVISION. THE OPERATING EXPENSES PAYABLE PURSUANT TO THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENT PROVISIONS IS LIMITED TO $350,000 FOR EACH MONTHLY PAYMENT DATE OR  $2.5 MILLION FOR THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING PERIOD OF TWELVE CONSECUTIVE MONTHLY PAYMENT DATES. THIS CEILING CAN BE INCREASED BY THE LESSER OF 5.0% OR THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ALL THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS ONLY ON THE  FIRST MONTHLY PAYMENT DATE TO OCCUR AFTER EACH  ONE-YEAR  ANNIVERSARY FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE CREDIT FACILITY. UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A MANAGER EVENT (DESCRIBED BELOW), THE CONSENT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO PAY OPERATING EXPENSES THROUGH THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS PROVISION.  EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  THE CREDIT  FACILITY CONTAINS CERTAIN NEGATIVE COVENANTS, CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT. THE CREDIT FACILITY DOES NOT CONTAIN GRACE PERIODS FOR BREACH BY THE COMPANY OF CERTAIN COVENANTS, INCLUDING,  WITHOUT LIMITATION, PRESERVATION OF EXISTENCE, NEGATIVE PLEDGE, CHANGE OF NAME OR JURISDICTION AND SEPARATE LEGAL ENTITY STATUS OF THE COMPANY COVENANTS AND CERTAIN  96  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER CUSTOMARY COVENANTS. OTHER EVENTS OF DEFAULT UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  AN INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO OF LESS THAN 150.0%;  \u2022  AN OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO OF LESS THAN 175.0%;  \u2022  THE FILING OF CERTAIN ERISA OR TAX LIENS;  \u2022  THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN \u201cMANAGER EVENTS\u201d SUCH AS.  \u2022  FAILURE BY SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND ITS AFFILIATES TO MAINTAIN COLLECTIVELY, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, A  CASH EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO AT LEAST $5.0 MILLION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE;  \u2022  FAILURE OF THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND THE COMPANY TO BE IN FULL FORCE AND  EFFECT;  \u2022  INDICTMENT OR CONVICTION OF SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS OR ANY \u201cKEY PERSON\u201d FOR A FELONY OFFENSE, OR  ANY FRAUD, EMBEZZLEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS BY SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS OR ANY \u201cKEY PERSON\u201d AND, IN THE CASE OF \u201cKEY PERSONS,\u201d WITHOUT A REPUTABLE, EXPERIENCED INDIVIDUAL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO MADISON CAPITAL  FUNDING APPOINTED TO REPLACE SUCH KEY PERSON WITHIN 30 DAYS;  \u2022  RESIGNATION, TERMINATION, DISABILITY OR DEATH OF A \u201cKEY PERSON\u201d OR FAILURE OF ANY \u201cKEY  PERSON\u201d TO PROVIDE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS\u2019 DAILY ACTIVITIES, ALL WITHOUT A REPUTABLE, EXPERIENCED INDIVIDUAL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING APPOINTED WITHIN 30 DAYS; OR  \u2022  OCCURRENCE OF ANY EVENT CONSTITUTING \u201cCAUSE\u201d UNDER THE COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE  COMPANY AND SARATOGA CLO (THE \u201cCLO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT\u201d), DELIVERY OF A NOTICE UNDER SECTION 12(C) OF THE CLO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE REMOVAL OF THE COMPANY AS COLLATERAL MANAGER OR THE COMPANY CEASES TO ACT AS  COLLATERAL MANAGER UNDER THE CLO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  CONDITIONS TO ACQUISITIONS AND PLEDGES OF LOAN ASSETS.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IMPOSES CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS TO THE ACQUISITION AND PLEDGE OF ADDITIONAL LOAN ASSETS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE COMPANY MAY NOT ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL LOAN ASSETS WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT INDICATES IN WRITING ITS SATISFACTION WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS\u2019 POLICIES, PERSONNEL AND PROCESSES RELATING TO THE LOAN ASSETS.  FEES AND EXPENSES.  THE COMPANY PAID CERTAIN FEES AND REIMBURSED MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC FOR THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ALL DOCUMENTED,  OUT-OF-POCKET  COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING THE REASONABLE FEES AND EXPENSES OF LAWYERS, INCURRED BY MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC IN CONNECTION WITH THE CREDIT FACILITY  AND THE CARRYING OUT OF ANY AND ALL ACTS CONTEMPLATED THEREUNDER UP TO AND AS OF THE DATE OF CLOSING OF THE STOCK PURCHASE TRANSACTION WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES. THESE AMOUNTS TOTALED $2.0 MILLION.  ON FEBRUARY 24, 2012, WE AMENDED OUR SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  EXPAND THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FROM $40.0 MILLION TO $45.0 MILLION;  \u2022  EXTEND THE PERIOD DURING WHICH WE MAY MAKE AND REPAY BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FROM JULY 30, 2013  TO FEBRUARY 24, 2015 (THE \u201cREVOLVING PERIOD\u201d). THE REVOLVING PERIOD MAY, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, BY ACTION OF THE LENDERS OR AUTOMATICALLY, BE TERMINATED. ALL BORROWINGS AND OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER THE CREDIT  FACILITY ARE DUE AND PAYABLE FIVE YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD; AND  97  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  REMOVE THE CONDITION THAT WE MAY NOT ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL LOAN ASSETS WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE  ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.  ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2014, WE ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDMENT TO THE REVOLVING FACILITY WITH  MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  EXTEND THE COMMITMENT TERMINATION DATE FROM FEBRUARY 24, 2015 TO SEPTEMBER 17, 2017;  \u2022  EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE OF THE REVOLVING FACILITY FROM FEBRUARY 24, 2020 TO SEPTEMBER 17, 2022 (UNLESS  TERMINATED SOONER UPON CERTAIN EVENTS);  \u2022  REDUCE THE APPLICABLE MARGIN RATE ON BASE RATE BORROWINGS FROM 4.50% TO 3.75%, AND ON LIBOR BORROWINGS FROM 5.50%  TO 4.75%; AND  \u2022  REDUCE THE FLOOR ON BASE RATE BORROWINGS FROM 3.00% TO 2.25%; AND ON LIBOR BORROWINGS FROM 2.00% TO 1.25%.  ON MAY 18, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A THIRD AMENDMENT TO THE CREDIT FACILITY WITH MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC TO,  AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  EXTEND THE COMMITMENT TERMINATION DATE FROM SEPTEMBER 17, 2017 TO SEPTEMBER 17, 2020;  \u2022  EXTEND THE FINAL MATURITY DATE OF THE CREDIT FACILITY FROM SEPTEMBER 17, 2022 TO SEPTEMBER 17, 2025;  \u2022  REDUCE THE FLOOR ON BASE RATE BORROWINGS FROM 2.25% TO 2.00%;  \u2022  REDUCE THE FLOOR ON LIBOR BORROWINGS FROM 1.25% TO 1.00%; AND  \u2022  REDUCE THE COMMITMENT FEE RATE FROM 0.75% TO 0.50% FOR ANY PERIOD DURING WHICH THE RATIO OF ADVANCES OUTSTANDING  TO AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS, EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE, IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 50%.  AS OF MAY 31, 2019, WE HAD  $0.0 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND $150.0 MILLION OF  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES OUTSTANDING (WHICH ARE DISCUSSED BELOW). AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE HAD NO  OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND $150.0 MILLION OF  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES OUTSTANDING. OUR BORROWING BASE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AT MAY 31, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS $27.3 MILLION AND $30.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  OUR ASSET COVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN THE 1940 ACT, WAS 238.9% AS OF  MAY 31, 2019 AND 234.5% AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES  IN ADDITION, WE, THROUGH A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, SOUGHT AND OBTAINED A LICENSE FROM THE SBA TO OPERATE AN SBIC. IN THIS REGARD, ON  MARCH 28, 2012, OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, SARATOGA INVESTMENT CORP. SBIC, LP, RECEIVED A LICENSE FROM THE SBA TO OPERATE AS AN SBIC UNDER SECTION 301(C) OF THE SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT ACT OF 1958. SBICS ARE DESIGNATED TO STIMULATE THE  FLOW OF PRIVATE EQUITY CAPITAL TO ELIGIBLE SMALL BUSINESSES. UNDER SBA REGULATIONS, SBICS MAY MAKE LOANS TO ELIGIBLE SMALL BUSINESSES AND INVEST IN THE EQUITY SECURITIES OF SMALL BUSINESSES.  THE SBIC LICENSE ALLOWS OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY TO OBTAIN LEVERAGE BY ISSUING  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES.  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES ARE  NON-RECOURSE,  INTEREST ONLY DEBENTURES WITH INTEREST PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY AND HAVE A  TEN-YEAR  MATURITY.  THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE PAID PRIOR TO MATURITY  BUT MAY BE PREPAID AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PENALTY. THE INTEREST RATE OF  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES IS FIXED ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS AT A MARKET-DRIVEN SPREAD OVER U.S. TREASURY NOTES WITH  TEN-YEAR  MATURITIES.  98  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SBA REGULATIONS CURRENTLY LIMIT THE AMOUNT THAT OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY MAY BORROW TO A MAXIMUM  OF $150.0 MILLION WHEN IT HAS AT LEAST $75.0 MILLION IN REGULATORY CAPITAL, RECEIVES A CAPITAL COMMITMENT FROM THE SBA AND HAS BEEN THROUGH AN EXAMINATION BY THE SBA SUBSEQUENT TO LICENSING. AS OF MAY 31, 2019, OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY HAD  $75.0 MILLION IN REGULATORY CAPITAL AND $150.0 MILLION  SBA-  GUARANTEED DEBENTURES OUTSTANDING.  WE RECEIVED EXEMPTIVE RELIEF FROM THE SEC TO PERMIT US TO EXCLUDE THE DEBT OF OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEED BY THE SBA FROM THE DEFINITION OF  SENIOR SECURITIES IN THE ASSET COVERAGE TEST UNDER THE 1940 ACT. THIS ALLOWS US INCREASED FLEXIBILITY UNDER THE ASSET COVERAGE TEST BY PERMITTING US TO BORROW UP TO $150.0 MILLION MORE THAN WE WOULD OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO ABSENT THE RECEIPT OF  THIS EXEMPTIVE RELIEF. ON APRIL 16, 2018, AS PERMITTED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT AVAILABILITY ACT, WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON MARCH 23, 2018, OUR  NON-  INTERESTED BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED OF  OUR BECOMING SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM ASSET COVERAGE RATIO OF 150.0% FROM 200% UNDER SECTIONS 18(A)(1) AND 18(A)(2) OF THE 1940 ACT. THE 150.0% ASSET COVERAGE RATIO BECAME EFFECTIVE ON APRIL 16, 2019.  ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2018, THE SBA ISSUED A \u201cGREEN LIGHT\u201d LETTER INVITING US TO FILE A FORMAL LICENSE APPLICATION FOR A SECOND SBIC  LICENSE. IF APPROVED, THE ADDITIONAL SBIC LICENSE WOULD PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH AN INCREMENTAL SOURCE OF LONG-TERM CAPITAL BY PERMITTING US TO ISSUE, SUBJECT TO SBA APPROVAL, UP TO $175.0 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES IN ADDITION TO THE $150.0 MILLION ALREADY APPROVED UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S FIRST LICENSE. RECEIPT OF A GREEN LIGHT LETTER FROM THE SBA DOES NOT ASSURE AN APPLICANT THAT THE SBA  WILL ULTIMATELY ISSUE AN SBIC LICENSE AND THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED NO ASSURANCE OR INDICATION FROM THE SBA THAT IT WILL RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL SBIC LICENSE, OR OF THE TIMEFRAME IN WHICH IT WOULD RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL LICENSE, SHOULD ONE ULTIMATELY BE  GRANTED.  UNSECURED NOTES  IN  MAY 2013, WE ISSUED $48.3 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR 2020 NOTES FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $46.1 MILLION AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING COMMISSIONS OF $1.9 MILLION AND OFFERING COSTS OF $0.3 MILLION. THE PROCEEDS  INCLUDED THE UNDERWRITERS\u2019 FULL EXERCISE OF THEIR OVERALLOTMENT OPTION. INTEREST ON THESE 2020 NOTES IS PAID QUARTERLY IN ARREARS ON FEBRUARY 15, MAY 15, AUGUST 15 AND NOVEMBER 15, AT A RATE OF 7.50% PER YEAR, BEGINNING  AUGUST 15, 2013. THE 2020 NOTES MATURE ON MAY 31, 2020 AND SINCE MAY 31, 2016, MAY BE REDEEMED IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT ANY TIME OR FROM TIME TO TIME AT OUR OPTION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2020 NOTES, WE AGREED TO THE  FOLLOWING COVENANTS FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME DURING WHICH THE 2020 NOTES ARE OUTSTANDING.  \u2022  WE WILL NOT VIOLATE (WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE SUBJECT TO) SECTION 18(A)(1)(A) AS MODIFIED BY  SECTION 61(A)(1) OF THE 1940 ACT OR ANY SUCCESSOR PROVISIONS, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY EXEMPTIVE RELIEF GRANTED TO US BY THE SEC. CURRENTLY, THESE PROVISIONS GENERALLY PROHIBIT US FROM MAKING ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE  ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL DEBT OR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL DEBT SECURITIES, UNLESS OUR ASSET COVERAGE, AS DEFINED IN THE 1940 ACT, EQUALS AT LEAST 200.0% AFTER SUCH BORROWINGS.  \u2022  WE WILL NOT VIOLATE (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE ARE SUBJECT TO) SECTION 18(A)(1)(B) AS MODIFIED BY  SECTION 61(A)(1) OF THE 1940 ACT OR ANY SUCCESSOR PROVISIONS, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO (I) ANY EXEMPTIVE RELIEF GRANTED TO US BY THE SEC AND  (II) NO-ACTION  RELIEF GRANTED BY THE SEC TO ANOTHER BDC  (OR TO THE COMPANY IF IT DETERMINES TO SEEK SUCH SIMILAR  NO-ACTION  OR OTHER RELIEF) PERMITTING THE BDC TO DECLARE ANY CASH DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROHIBITION CONTAINED IN  SECTION 18(A) (1)(B) AS MODIFIED BY SECTION 61(A)(1) OF THE 1940 ACT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE BDC\u2019S STATUS AS A REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE CODE. CURRENTLY THESE PROVISIONS GENERALLY PROHIBIT US FROM DECLARING ANY CASH  DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION UPON ANY CLASS OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK, OR PURCHASING ANY SUCH CAPITAL STOCK IF OUR ASSET COVERAGE, AS DEFINED IN THE 1940 ACT, IS BELOW 200.0% AT THE TIME OF THE DECLARATION OF THE DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION OR THE PURCHASE AND  AFTER DEDUCTING THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DIVIDEND, DISTRIBUTION OR PURCHASE.  THE 2020 NOTES WERE REDEEMED IN FULL ON  JANUARY 13, 2017 AND ARE NO LONGER LISTED ON THE NYSE.  99  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON MAY 29, 2015, WE ENTERED INTO A DEBT DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH LADENBURG  THALMANN & CO.

PRIOR TO THE 2020 NOTES BEING REDEEMED IN FULL, THE COMPANY HAD SOLD  539,725 BONDS WITH A PRINCIPAL OF $13.5 MILLION AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $25.31 FOR AGGREGATE NET PROCEEDS OF $13.4 MILLION (NET OF TRANSACTION COSTS).

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION, INVESTIGATIONS AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL, EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS. WE ESTIMATE AND ACCRUE OUR LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM SUCH MATTERS BASED UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STAGE OF THE PROCEEDING; POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT VALUE; ASSESSMENTS BY INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COUNSEL; AND ASSESSMENTS BY ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERS AND CONSULTANTS OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND REMEDIATION COSTS.  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY ACCRUED FOR THESE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES; HOWEVER, FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY CHANGE, SUCH AS NEW DEVELOPMENTS, OR A CHANGE IN APPROACH, INCLUDING A CHANGE IN SETTLEMENT STRATEGY OR IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION PLAN, THAT COULD CAUSE THE ACTUAL LIABILITY TO EXCEED THE ESTIMATES, OR MAY REQUIRE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RECORDED LIABILITY BALANCES IN THE FUTURE.  OUR ESTIMATE OF LIABILITY AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY AND OUR REMAINING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REMEDIATE THE LOWER PASSAIC RIVER IN NEW JERSEY AND OTHER SITES ARE ACCRUED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, OUR AGGREGATE ENVIRONMENTAL RELATED ACCRUALS WERE $2.6 MILLION, OF WHICH $0.7 MILLION WAS INCLUDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES, WITH THE REMAINDER INCLUDED IN NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES. AS RELATED TO CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, THE ACCRUAL WAS ESTIMATED AT THE LOW END OF A RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES SINCE NO AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE THAN ANY OTHER AMOUNT.  IF WE HAD ACCRUED AT THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, FOR THOSE SITES WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE OUR LIABILITY, OUR ACCRUAL WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION HIGHER.  THESE ACCRUALS CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE NATURE OR EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE METHODS OF REMEDIATION REQUIRED, CHANGES IN THE APPORTIONMENT OF COSTS AMONG RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE COVERAGE AND OTHER ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES OR PRIVATE PARTIES, OR THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF BEING NAMED IN A NEW MATTER.

REVENUES  OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND HEAVILY ON SUCCESSFULLY LEASING AND OPERATING THE OFFICE SPACE IN OUR PORTFOLIO. ECONOMIC GROWTH AND OFFICE EMPLOYMENT LEVELS IN OUR CORE MARKETS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, IN PREDICTING OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.  THE KEY COMPONENTS AFFECTING OUR RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES ARE AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, RENTAL RATES, COST RECOVERY INCOME, NEW DEVELOPMENTS PLACED IN SERVICE, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS. AVERAGE OCCUPANCY GENERALLY INCREASES DURING TIMES OF IMPROVING ECONOMIC GROWTH, AS OUR ABILITY TO LEASE SPACE OUTPACES VACANCIES THAT OCCUR UPON THE EXPIRATIONS OF EXISTING LEASES. AVERAGE OCCUPANCY GENERALLY DECLINES DURING TIMES OF SLOWER OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH, WHEN NEW VACANCIES TEND TO OUTPACE OUR ABILITY TO LEASE SPACE. ASSET ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS PLACED IN SERVICE DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR RENTAL REVENUES AND COULD IMPACT OUR AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, DEPENDING UPON THE OCCUPANCY RATE OF THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE ACQUIRED, SOLD OR PLACED IN SERVICE. A FURTHER INDICATOR OF THE PREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE REVENUES IS THE EXPECTED LEASE EXPIRATIONS OF OUR PORTFOLIO. AS A RESULT, IN ADDITION TO SEEKING TO INCREASE OUR AVERAGE OCCUPANCY BY LEASING CURRENT VACANT SPACE, WE ALSO CONCENTRATE OUR LEASING EFFORTS ON RENEWING EXISTING LEASES PRIOR TO EXPIRATION. FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING OUR LEASE EXPIRATIONS, SEE \"PROPERTIES - LEASE EXPIRATIONS\" IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. OCCUPANCY IN OUR OFFICE PORTFOLIO DECREASED FROM  91.6%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  TO  90.5%  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  . WE EXPECT AVERAGE OCCUPANCY FOR OUR OFFICE PORTFOLIO TO BE APPROXIMATELY  91%  FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  WHETHER OR NOT OUR RENTAL REVENUE TRACKS AVERAGE OCCUPANCY PROPORTIONALLY DEPENDS UPON WHETHER GAAP RENTS UNDER SIGNED NEW AND RENEWAL LEASES ARE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE GAAP RENTS UNDER EXPIRING LEASES. ANNUALIZED RENTAL REVENUES FROM SECOND GENERATION LEASES EXPIRING DURING ANY PARTICULAR YEAR ARE TYPICALLY LESS THAN 15% OF OUR TOTAL ANNUAL RENTAL REVENUES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH INFORMATION REGARDING SECOND GENERATION OFFICE LEASES SIGNED DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  (WE DEFINE SECOND GENERATION OFFICE LEASES AS LEASES WITH NEW CUSTOMERS AND RENEWALS OF EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN OFFICE SPACE THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED UNDER OUR OWNERSHIP AND LEASES WITH RESPECT TO VACANT SPACE IN ACQUIRED BUILDINGS).  NEW  RENEWAL  ALL OFFICE  LEASED SPACE (IN RENTABLE SQUARE FEET)  328,989  746,761  1,075,750  AVERAGE TERM (IN YEARS - RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT WEIGHTED)  6.7  5.0  5.5  BASE RENTS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $30.39  $30.69  $30.60  RENT CONCESSIONS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  (1.00  )  (0.25  )  (0.48  )  GAAP RENTS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $29.39  $30.44  $30.12  TENANT IMPROVEMENTS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $4.97  $2.21  $3.05  LEASING COMMISSIONS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $1.11  $0.87  $0.94  __________  (1)  WEIGHTED AVERAGE PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  ANNUAL COMBINED GAAP RENTS FOR NEW AND RENEWAL LEASES SIGNED IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER WERE  $30.12  PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT,  16.8%  HIGHER  COMPARED TO PREVIOUS LEASES IN THE SAME OFFICE SPACES.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSE, STABLE AND CREDITWORTHY CUSTOMER BASE. WE HAVE AN INTERNAL GUIDELINE WHEREBY CUSTOMERS THAT ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 3% OF OUR REVENUES ARE PERIODICALLY REVIEWED WITH THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , NO CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN  3%  OF OUR CASH REVENUES OTHER THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR LESS THAN  5%  OF OUR CASH REVENUES ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. UPON COMPLETION OF THE METLIFE III DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN RALEIGH, IT IS EXPECTED THAT METLIFE WILL ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY  3.4%  OF OUR REVENUES BASED ON ANNUALIZED CASH REVENUES FOR  JUNE 2019.  EXPENSES  OUR EXPENSES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF RENTAL PROPERTY EXPENSES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND INTEREST EXPENSE. FROM TIME TO TIME, EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS. RENTAL PROPERTY EXPENSES ARE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF RENTAL PROPERTIES AND INCLUDE EXPENSES THAT VARY SOMEWHAT PROPORTIONATELY TO OCCUPANCY LEVELS, SUCH AS JANITORIAL SERVICES AND UTILITIES, AND EXPENSES THAT DO NOT VARY BASED ON OCCUPANCY, SUCH AS PROPERTY TAXES AND INSURANCE. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION IS A NON-CASH EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE OWNERSHIP OF REAL PROPERTY AND GENERALLY REMAINS RELATIVELY CONSISTENT EACH YEAR, UNLESS WE BUY, PLACE IN SERVICE OR SELL ASSETS, SINCE OUR PROPERTIES AND RELATED BUILDING AND TENANT IMPROVEMENT ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER FIXED LIVES. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEE SALARIES AND BENEFITS, CORPORATE OVERHEAD AND SHORT AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  NET OPERATING INCOME  WHETHER OR NOT WE RECORD INCREASING SAME PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME (\u201cNOI\u201d) DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO GARNER HIGHER RENTAL REVENUES, WHETHER FROM HIGHER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, HIGHER GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT OR HIGHER COST RECOVERY INCOME, THAT EXCEED ANY CORRESPONDING GROWTH IN OPERATING EXPENSES. SAME PROPERTY NOI WAS  $2.6 MILLION  , OR  2.3%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SAME PROPERTY REVENUES OF  $3.4 MILLION  OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF  $0.7 MILLION  IN SAME PROPERTY EXPENSES. WE EXPECT SAME PROPERTY NOI TO BE HIGHER IN THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 AS HIGHER RENTAL REVENUES, MOSTLY FROM HIGHER AVERAGE GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT, ARE EXPECTED TO MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER EXPECTED AVERAGE OCCUPANCY AND AN ANTICIPATED INCREASE IN SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES.  IN ADDITION TO THE EFFECT OF SAME PROPERTY NOI, WHETHER OR NOT NOI INCREASES DEPENDS UPON WHETHER THE NOI FROM OUR ACQUIRED PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE EXCEEDS THE NOI FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS. NOI WAS  $4.4 MILLION  , OR  3.7%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO THE IMPACT OF DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE, PARTLY OFFSET BY NOI LOST FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS AND LOWER RESTORATION FEES. WE EXPECT NOI TO BE HIGHER IN THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 DUE TO THE IMPACT OF OUR NET INVESTMENT ACTIVITY IN SUCH PERIODS.  CASH FLOWS  IN CALCULATING NET CASH RELATED TO OPERATING ACTIVITIES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, WHICH ARE NON-CASH EXPENSES, ARE ADDED BACK TO NET INCOME. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY GENERATED A POSITIVE AMOUNT OF CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON CHANGES IN OUR NET INCOME, AS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY BELOW UNDER \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d CHANGES IN RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES AND NET ADDITIONS OR DECREASES IN OUR OVERALL PORTFOLIO.  NET CASH RELATED TO INVESTING ACTIVITIES GENERALLY RELATES TO CAPITALIZED COSTS INCURRED FOR LEASING AND MAJOR BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS AND OUR ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT, DISPOSITION AND JOINT VENTURE ACTIVITY. DURING PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT NET ACQUISITION AND/OR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY, OUR CASH USED IN SUCH INVESTING ACTIVITIES WILL GENERALLY EXCEED CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES, WHICH TYPICALLY CONSISTS OF CASH RECEIVED UPON THE SALE OF PROPERTIES AND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR JOINT VENTURES.  NET CASH RELATED TO FINANCING ACTIVITIES GENERALLY RELATES TO DISTRIBUTIONS, INCURRENCE AND REPAYMENT OF DEBT, AND ISSUANCES, REPURCHASES OR REDEMPTIONS OF COMMON STOCK, COMMON UNITS AND PREFERRED STOCK. WE USE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR CASH TO FUND DISTRIBUTIONS. WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE INCREASES IN THE OUTSTANDING BALANCES OF DEBT DURING A PERIOD DEPENDS GENERALLY UPON THE NET EFFECT OF OUR ACQUISITION, DISPOSITION, DEVELOPMENT AND JOINT VENTURE ACTIVITY. WE GENERALLY USE OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR DAILY WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES, WHICH MEANS THAT DURING ANY GIVEN PERIOD, IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE INTEREST EXPENSE, WE MAY RECORD SIGNIFICANT REPAYMENTS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  FOR A DISCUSSION REGARDING DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS, SEE \"LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.\"  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN A CONSERVATIVE AND FLEXIBLE BALANCE SHEET WITH ACCESS TO MULTIPLE SOURCES OF DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL AND SUFFICIENT AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT ALLOWS US TO CAPITALIZE ON FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY ARISE.  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES ARE OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF FUNDS TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS INCLUDE AVAILABLE WORKING CAPITAL AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH HAD  $478.9 MILLION  OF AVAILABILITY AT  JULY 16, 2019  . OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF OPERATING EXPENSES, INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL AMORTIZATION ON OUR DEBT, DISTRIBUTIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING BUILDING IMPROVEMENT COSTS, TENANT IMPROVEMENT COSTS AND LEASE COMMISSIONS. BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITAL COSTS TO MAINTAIN OR ENHANCE EXISTING BUILDINGS NOT TYPICALLY RELATED TO A SPECIFIC CUSTOMER. TENANT IMPROVEMENTS ARE THE COSTS REQUIRED TO CUSTOMIZE SPACE FOR THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND PLANNED FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. WE USE OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES AND FOR THE SHORT-TERM FUNDING OF OUR DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE REPAYMENT OF OTHER DEBT. CONTINUED ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ALLOWS US TO QUICKLY CAPITALIZE ON STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES AT SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES.  OUR LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY USES GENERALLY CONSIST OF THE RETIREMENT OR REFINANCING OF DEBT UPON MATURITY, FUNDING OF BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS, NEW BUILDING DEVELOPMENTS AND LAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND FUNDING ACQUISITIONS OF BUILDINGS AND DEVELOPMENT LAND. OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR STARTED AND/OR COMMITTED NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WERE APPROXIMATELY  $316 MILLION  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  . ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, RETIRE OUTSTANDING EQUITY AND/OR DEBT SECURITIES THROUGH REDEMPTIONS, OPEN MARKET REPURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED ACQUISITIONS OR OTHERWISE.  WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF.  \u2022  CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES;  \u2022  BANK TERM LOANS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY;  \u2022  THE ISSUANCE OF UNSECURED DEBT;  \u2022  THE ISSUANCE OF SECURED DEBT;  \u2022  THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE COMPANY OR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP; AND  \u2022  THE DISPOSITION OF NON-CORE ASSETS.  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , OUR LEVERAGE RATIO, AS MEASURED BY THE RATIO OF OUR MORTGAGES AND NOTES PAYABLE AND OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK TO THE UNDEPRECIATED BOOK VALUE OF OUR ASSETS, WAS  35.9%  AND THERE WERE  106.4 MILLION  DILUTED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING.  INVESTMENT ACTIVITY  AS NOTED ABOVE, A KEY TENET OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN IS TO CONTINUOUSLY UPGRADE THE QUALITY OF OUR OFFICE PORTFOLIO THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND DEVELOPMENT. WE GENERALLY SEEK TO ACQUIRE AND DEVELOP OFFICE BUILDINGS THAT IMPROVE THE AVERAGE QUALITY OF OUR OVERALL PORTFOLIO AND DELIVER CONSISTENT AND SUSTAINABLE VALUE FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS OVER THE LONG-TERM. WHETHER OR NOT AN ASSET ACQUISITION OR NEW DEVELOPMENT RESULTS IN HIGHER PER SHARE NET INCOME OR FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\"FFO\") IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE NOI FOR ANY SUCH PERIOD EXCEEDS THE ACTUAL COST OF CAPITAL USED TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT. ADDITIONALLY, GIVEN THE LENGTH OF CONSTRUCTION CYCLES, DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE NOT PLACED IN SERVICE UNTIL, IN SOME CASES, SEVERAL YEARS AFTER COMMENCEMENT. SALES OF NON-CORE ASSETS COULD RESULT IN LOWER PER SHARE NET INCOME OR FFO IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD IN THE EVENT THE RESULTING USE OF PROCEEDS DOES NOT EXCEED THE CAPITALIZATION RATE ON THE SOLD PROPERTIES.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE  $5.3 MILLION  , OR  3.0%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY REVENUES, WHICH INCREASED RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES BY $6.4 MILLION AND $3.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT AND HIGHER PARKING INCOME, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY LOST REVENUE FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS AND LOWER RESTORATION FEES, WHICH DECREASED RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES BY $2.8 MILLION AND $1.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPECT RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES TO BE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY REVENUES, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOST REVENUE FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  OPERATING EXPENSES  RENTAL PROPERTY AND OTHER EXPENSES WERE  $0.9 MILLION  , OR  1.5%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES BY $1.2 MILLION AND $0.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES AND INSURANCE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY A $1.1 MILLION DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS. WE EXPECT RENTAL PROPERTY AND OTHER EXPENSES TO BE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS  $2.8 MILLION  , OR  4.9%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY LEASE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, PARTLY OFFSET BY FULLY AMORTIZED ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS. WE EXPECT DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION TO BE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 FOR SIMILAR REASONS.  WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF  $0.5 MILLION  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  , WHICH RESULTED FROM A CHANGE IN MARKET-BASED INPUTS AND OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF THE ASSETS. WE RECORDED NO SUCH IMPAIRMENT IN  2018.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE RELATIVELY UNCHANGED IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED LEASE RELATED COSTS THAT ARE NOW EXPENSED UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD IN 2019 AND HIGHER COMPANY-WIDE BASE SALARIES AND BENEFITS OFFSET BY LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND LOWER EXPENSED PRE-DEVELOPMENT COSTS. WE EXPECT GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 TO BE RELATIVELY CONSISTENT TO 2018 FOR SIMILAR REASONS.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $2.5 MILLION  , OR  13.9%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES, HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES AND LOWER CAPITALIZED INTEREST. WE EXPECT INTEREST EXPENSE TO BE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 FOR SIMILAR REASONS.  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS)  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS) WAS  $0.1 MILLION  LOWER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INTEREST INCOME.  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY WERE  $10.3 MILLION  LOWER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO THE NET EFFECT OF THE DISPOSITION ACTIVITY IN SUCH PERIODS.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES WAS  $0.2 MILLION  , OR  40.1%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY. WE EXPECT EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES TO BE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 FOR THE SAME REASON.  EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE - DILUTED  DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WAS  $0.11  LOWER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO A DECREASE IN NET INCOME FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  LASER SPINE INSTITUTE  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE PROVIDED INFORMATION ON LASER SPINE INSTITUTE, WHICH OCCUPIED A 176,000 SQUARE-FOOT, SIX-STORY BUILDING WITH STRUCTURED PARKING IN TAMPA\u2019S WESTSHORE SUBMARKET, A BBD. THE BUILDING, DEVELOPED BY US, HAD BEEN USED BY LASER SPINE INSTITUTE FOR BOTH ITS COMPANY HEADQUARTERS AND AN AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTER. AFTER THE MARKET CLOSED ON MARCH 1, 2019, LASER SPINE INSTITUTE ANNOUNCED IT WOULD IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE ITS OPERATIONS. THIS UNEXPECTED ANNOUNCEMENT AFFECTED ALL OF ITS LOCATIONS NATIONWIDE. AS A RESULT OF THIS SUDDEN CLOSURE, WE INCURRED $5.6 MILLION OF CREDIT LOSSES ON OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES AND WRITE-OFFS OF $2.3 MILLION OF LEASE INCENTIVES, $4.1 MILLION OF NOTES RECEIVABLE AND $11.6 MILLION OF TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND DEFERRED LEASING COSTS.  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE  $2.8 MILLION  , OR  0.8%  ,  LOWER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS, LOWER SAME PROPERTY REVENUES AND LOWER RESTORATION FEES, WHICH DECREASED RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES BY $5.3 MILLION, $4.1 MILLION AND $3.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE LOWER PRIMARILY DUE TO CREDIT LOSSES ON OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES AND WRITE-OFFS OF LEASE INCENTIVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LASER SPINE INSTITUTE, PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AVERAGE GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT AND HIGHER PARKING INCOME. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER REVENUE OF $10.4 MILLION FROM DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE.  OPERATING EXPENSES  RENTAL PROPERTY AND OTHER EXPENSES WERE  $2.0 MILLION  , OR  1.7%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES BY $2.1 MILLION AND $1.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES AND REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER UTILITIES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY A $1.7 MILLION DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS  $14.4 MILLION  , OR  12.6%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND DEFERRED LEASING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LASER SPINE INSTITUTE AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE, PARTLY OFFSET BY PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF  $0.5 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  , WHICH RESULTED FROM A CHANGE IN MARKET-BASED INPUTS AND OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF THE ASSETS. WE RECORDED NO SUCH IMPAIRMENT IN  2018.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  $0.6 MILLION  , OR  2.9%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED LEASE RELATED COSTS THAT ARE NOW EXPENSED UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD IN 2019 AND HIGHER COMPANY-WIDE BASE SALARIES AND BENEFITS, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND EXPENSED PRE-DEVELOPMENT COSTS.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $2.8 MILLION  , OR  7.8%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES AND HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS)  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS) WAS  $4.4 MILLION  LOWER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO THE WRITE-OFF OF NOTES RECEIVABLE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LASER SPINE INSTITUTE.  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY WERE  $10.3 MILLION  LOWER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO THE NET EFFECT OF THE DISPOSITION ACTIVITY IN SUCH PERIODS.  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES WAS  $0.4 MILLION  , OR  33.8%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY.  EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE - DILUTED  DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WAS  $0.35  LOWER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO A DECREASE IN NET INCOME FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS  WE REPORT AND ANALYZE OUR CASH FLOWS BASED ON OPERATING ACTIVITIES, INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE CHANGES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH FLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).

WE EXPECT NET CASH RELATED TO OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 TO BE HIGHER AS COMPARED TO 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND SAME PROPERTIES, PARTLY OFFSET BY PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ACQUISITION ACTIVITY AND HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN DEVELOPMENT IN-PROCESS IN 2018. WE EXPECT USES OF CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 TO BE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY WHETHER OR NOT WE ACQUIRE OR COMMENCE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE BBDS OF OUR MARKETS. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY  $316 MILLION  LEFT TO FUND OF OUR PREVIOUSLY-ANNOUNCED DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY IN 2019 AND FUTURE YEARS. WE EXPECT THESE USES OF CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WILL BE PARTLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET DEBT BORROWINGS IN 2019. ASSUMING THE NET EFFECT OF OUR ACQUISITION, DISPOSITION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY IN 2019 RESULTS IN AN INCREASE TO OUR ASSETS, WE WOULD EXPECT OUTSTANDING DEBT AND/OR COMMON STOCK BALANCES TO INCREASE.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CAPITALIZATION  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE COMPANY\u2019S CAPITALIZATION (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS).

THE SECURED INDEBTEDNESS WAS COLLATERALIZED BY REAL ESTATE ASSETS WITH AN UNDEPRECIATED BOOK VALUE OF  $146.2 MILLION  . AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  ,  $486.0 MILLION  OF OUR DEBT DOES NOT BEAR INTEREST AT FIXED RATES OR IS NOT PROTECTED BY INTEREST RATE HEDGE CONTRACTS.  INVESTMENT ACTIVITY  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE REGULARLY EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS. AS A RESULT, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY HAVE ONE OR MORE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION THAT ARE IN VARYING STAGES OF EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION OR DUE DILIGENCE, INCLUDING POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO NON-BINDING LETTERS OF INTENT OR ENFORCEABLE CONTRACTS. CONSUMMATION OF ANY TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING THE SATISFACTION OF CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE PROVIDED THAT WE WILL ACQUIRE ANY PROPERTIES IN THE FUTURE. SEE \"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - RECENT AND FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES MAY FAIL TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS AND MAY REQUIRE RENOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS EXCEEDING OUR ESTIMATES\" IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE AND THE BROMLEY COMPANIES FORMED A JOINT VENTURE (THE \"MIDTOWN ONE JOINT VENTURE\u201d) TO CONSTRUCT MIDTOWN ONE, A  150,000  SQUARE FOOT, MULTI-CUSTOMER OFFICE BUILDING LOCATED IN THE MIXED-USE MIDTOWN TAMPA PROJECT IN TAMPA\u2019S WESTSHORE SUBMARKET. MIDTOWN ONE HAS AN ANTICIPATED TOTAL INVESTMENT OF  $71.3 MILLION  . CONSTRUCTION OF MIDTOWN ONE IS PROJECTED TO BEGIN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 WITH A SCHEDULED COMPLETION DATE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2021. AT CLOSING, WE AGREED TO CONTRIBUTE CASH OF  $20.0 MILLION  (  $12.8 MILLION  OF WHICH WAS FUNDED AND/OR PLACED IN ESCROW AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  ) IN EXCHANGE FOR AN  80.0%  INTEREST IN THE MIDTOWN ONE JOINT VENTURE AND THE BROMLEY COMPANIES CONTRIBUTED LAND VALUED AT  $5.0 MILLION  IN EXCHANGE FOR THE REMAINING  20.0%  INTEREST. WE ALSO COMMITTED TO PROVIDE A  $46.3 MILLION  INTEREST-ONLY SECURED CONSTRUCTION LOAN TO THE MIDTOWN ONE JOINT VENTURE THAT IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE ON THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF COMPLETION. THE LOAN BEARS INTEREST AT  LIBOR PLUS 250 BASIS POINTS  . AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , NO AMOUNTS UNDER THE LOAN HAVE BEEN FUNDED. THE MIDTOWN ONE JOINT VENTURE IS CONSOLIDATED.  ON JULY 3, 2019, WE SOLD LAND PARCELS FOR AN AGGREGATE SALE PRICE OF  $7.3 MILLION  AND EXPECT TO RECORD NOMINAL AGGREGATE LOSSES ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY.  ON JULY 8, 2019, WE SOLD A BUILDING FOR A SALE PRICE OF  $4.7 MILLION  AND EXPECT TO RECORD A GAIN ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY OF  $2.6 MILLION.  ON JULY 12, 2019, WE ACQUIRED DEVELOPMENT LAND IN RALEIGH FOR A PURCHASE PRICE, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED ACQUISITION COSTS, OF  $6.6 MILLION.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE SOLD  TWO  BUILDINGS AND LAND FOR AN AGGREGATE SALE PRICE OF  $32.5 MILLION  AND RECORDED AGGREGATE GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY OF  $6.7 MILLION.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF  $0.5 MILLION  , WHICH RESULTED FROM A CHANGE IN MARKET-BASED INPUTS AND OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF THE ASSETS.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE WERE DEVELOPING  0.8 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE PROPERTIES.

RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN LAND HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS, NOT DEVELOPMENT IN-PROCESS.  FINANCING ACTIVITY  WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SEPARATE EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WITH EACH OF WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, ROBERT W. BAIRD & CO. INCORPORATED, BB&T CAPITAL MARKETS, A DIVISION OF BB&T SECURITIES, LLC, MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED, BTIG, LLC, CAPITAL ONE SECURITIES, INC., FIFTH THIRD SECURITIES, INC., JEFFERIES LLC AND J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY MAY OFFER AND SELL UP TO $300.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE GROSS SALES PRICE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH SUCH FIRMS, ACTING AS AGENTS OF THE COMPANY OR AS PRINCIPALS. SALES OF THE SHARES, IF ANY, MAY BE MADE BY MEANS OF ORDINARY BROKERS\u2019 TRANSACTIONS ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (\"NYSE\") OR OTHERWISE AT MARKET PRICES PREVAILING AT THE TIME OF SALE, AT PRICES RELATED TO PREVAILING MARKET PRICES OR AT NEGOTIATED PRICES OR AS OTHERWISE AGREED WITH ANY OF SUCH FIRMS.  OUR $600.0 MILLION  UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN  JANUARY 2022  AND INCLUDES AN ACCORDION FEATURE THAT ALLOWS FOR AN ADDITIONAL  $400.0 MILLION  OF BORROWING CAPACITY SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL LENDER COMMITMENTS. ASSUMING NO DEFAULTS HAVE OCCURRED, WE HAVE AN OPTION TO EXTEND THE MATURITY FOR  TWO  ADDITIONAL  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS. THE INTEREST RATE AT OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS IS  LIBOR PLUS 100 BASIS POINTS  AND THE ANNUAL FACILITY FEE IS 20 BASIS POINTS. THE INTEREST RATE AND FACILITY FEE ARE BASED ON THE HIGHER OF THE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED RATINGS FROM MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE OR STANDARD & POOR'S RATINGS SERVICES. THERE WAS  $136.0 MILLION  AND  $121.0 MILLION  OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  JULY 16, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. AT BOTH  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  JULY 16, 2019  , WE HAD  $0.1 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT, WHICH REDUCES THE AVAILABILITY ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. AS A RESULT, THE UNUSED CAPACITY OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  JULY 16, 2019  WAS $463.9 MILLION  AND  $478.9 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  WE ARE CURRENTLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED DEBT. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AND RATIOS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT YEAR, DEPENDING UPON OUR FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE, PROPERTY AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE.  OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND BANK TERM LOANS REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH CUSTOMARY OPERATING COVENANTS AND VARIOUS FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. UPON AN EVENT OF DEFAULT ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE LENDERS HAVING AT LEAST 51.0% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CAN ACCELERATE ALL BORROWINGS THEN OUTSTANDING, AND WE COULD BE PROHIBITED FROM BORROWING ANY FURTHER AMOUNTS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT AGREEMENTS CONTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS GIVING THE UNSECURED LENDERS THE RIGHT TO DECLARE A DEFAULT IF WE ARE IN DEFAULT UNDER MORE THAN $30.0 MILLION WITH RESPECT TO OTHER LOANS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE INDENTURE THAT GOVERNS THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP'S OUTSTANDING NOTES REQUIRES US TO COMPLY WITH CUSTOMARY OPERATING COVENANTS AND VARIOUS FINANCIAL RATIOS. THE TRUSTEE OR THE HOLDERS OF AT LEAST 25.0% IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ANY SERIES OF NOTES CAN ACCELERATE THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SUCH SERIES UPON WRITTEN NOTICE OF A DEFAULT THAT REMAINS UNCURED AFTER 60 DAYS.  WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPAY, REFINANCE OR EXTEND ANY OR ALL OF OUR DEBT AT MATURITY OR UPON ANY ACCELERATION. IF ANY REFINANCING IS DONE AT HIGHER INTEREST RATES, THE INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW AND ABILITY TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS. ANY SUCH REFINANCING COULD ALSO IMPOSE TIGHTER FINANCIAL RATIOS AND OTHER COVENANTS THAT RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COULD OTHERWISE BE IN OUR BEST INTEREST, SUCH AS FUNDING NEW DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY, MAKING OPPORTUNISTIC ACQUISITIONS, REPURCHASING OUR SECURITIES OR PAYING DISTRIBUTIONS.  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS  TO MAINTAIN ITS QUALIFICATION AS A REIT, THE COMPANY MUST PAY DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS THAT ARE AT LEAST 90.0% OF ITS ANNUAL REIT TAXABLE INCOME, EXCLUDING NET CAPITAL GAINS. THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO DISTRIBUTE AT LEAST ENOUGH CASH FOR THE COMPANY TO BE ABLE TO PAY SUCH DIVIDENDS. THE COMPANY'S REIT TAXABLE INCOME, AS DETERMINED BY THE FEDERAL TAX LAWS, DOES NOT EQUAL ITS NET INCOME UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d). IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH CAPITAL GAINS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO MAINTAIN REIT STATUS, CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX UNLESS SUCH GAINS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO STOCKHOLDERS.  CASH DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CASH THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER BUSINESS PURPOSES, INCLUDING FUNDING DEBT MATURITIES, REDUCING DEBT OR FUTURE GROWTH INITIATIVES. THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS THAT WILL BE MADE IS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS THAT WILL AFFECT SUCH CASH FLOWS AND, ACCORDINGLY, INFLUENCE THE DECISIONS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS, SEE \"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS\" IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  , THE COMPANY DECLARED AND PAID A CASH DIVIDEND OF  $0.475  PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK.  CURRENT AND FUTURE CASH NEEDS  WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER AVAILABLE FINANCING SOURCES, INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, THE ISSUANCE OF SECURED DEBT, BANK TERM LOANS, BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE COMPANY OR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND THE DISPOSITION OF NON-CORE ASSETS, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS.  WE HAD  $4.5 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  . THE UNUSED CAPACITY OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  JULY 16, 2019  WAS  $463.9 MILLION  AND  $478.9 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, EXCLUDING AN ACCORDION FEATURE THAT ALLOWS FOR AN ADDITIONAL  $400.0 MILLION  OF BORROWING CAPACITY SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL LENDER COMMITMENTS.  WE HAVE A CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 WITH THE SEC PURSUANT TO WHICH, AT ANY TIME AND FROM TIME TO TIME, IN ONE OR MORE OFFERINGS ON AN AS-NEEDED BASIS, THE COMPANY MAY SELL AN INDEFINITE AMOUNT OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK AND DEPOSITARY SHARES AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP MAY SELL AN INDEFINITE AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURITIES, SUBJECT TO OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT OFFERINGS ON SATISFACTORY TERMS BASED ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS.  THE COMPANY FROM TIME TO TIME ENTERS INTO EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WITH A VARIETY OF FIRMS PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY MAY OFFER AND SELL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH SUCH FIRMS, ACTING AS AGENTS OF THE COMPANY OR AS PRINCIPALS. SALES OF THE SHARES, IF ANY, MAY BE MADE BY MEANS OF ORDINARY BROKERS\u2019 TRANSACTIONS ON THE NYSE OR OTHERWISE AT MARKET PRICES PREVAILING AT THE TIME OF SALE, AT PRICES RELATED TO PREVAILING MARKET PRICES OR AT NEGOTIATED PRICES OR AS OTHERWISE AGREED WITH ANY OF SUCH FIRMS (WHICH MAY INCLUDE BLOCK TRADES).  DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019, WE ALSO EXPECT TO SELL AN ADDITIONAL  $62 MILLION  TO  $112 MILLION  OF PROPERTIES NO LONGER CONSIDERED TO BE CORE ASSETS DUE TO LOCATION, AGE, QUALITY AND/OR OVERALL STRATEGIC FIT. WE CAN MAKE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT WE WILL SELL ANY NON-CORE ASSETS OR, IF WE DO, WHAT THE TIMING OR TERMS OF ANY SUCH SALE WILL BE.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THERE WERE NO CHANGES MADE BY MANAGEMENT TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  OTHER THAN THE NEW LEASE STANDARD ADOPTION EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019, WHICH CHANGED OUR POLICY WITH RESPECT TO ESTIMATING CREDIT LOSSES ON OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THIS POLICY, SEE NOTE 2 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF ALL OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, SEE \u201cMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\u201d IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  NON-GAAP INFORMATION  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE ARE BENEFICIAL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS AND ARE IMPORTANT INDICATORS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY EQUITY REIT. BECAUSE THESE FFO CALCULATIONS EXCLUDE SUCH FACTORS AS DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND GAINS OR LOSSES FROM SALES OF OPERATING REAL ESTATE ASSETS, WHICH CAN VARY AMONG OWNERS OF IDENTICAL ASSETS IN SIMILAR CONDITIONS BASED ON HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING AND USEFUL LIFE ESTIMATES, THEY FACILITATE COMPARISONS OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE BETWEEN PERIODS AND BETWEEN OTHER REITS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP IMPLICITLY ASSUMES THAT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS DIMINISHES PREDICTABLY OVER TIME. SINCE REAL ESTATE VALUES HAVE HISTORICALLY RISEN OR FALLEN WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE USE OF FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE, TOGETHER WITH THE REQUIRED GAAP PRESENTATIONS, PROVIDES A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO ITS COMPETITORS AND A MORE INFORMED AND APPROPRIATE BASIS ON WHICH TO MAKE DECISIONS INVOLVING OPERATING, FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND THEREFORE DO NOT REPRESENT NET INCOME OR NET INCOME PER SHARE AS DEFINED BY GAAP. NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER SHARE AS DEFINED BY GAAP ARE THE MOST RELEVANT MEASURES IN DETERMINING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THESE FFO MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS THAT INVESTORS MAY DEEM SUBJECTIVE, SUCH AS ADDING BACK EXPENSES SUCH AS DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENTS. FURTHERMORE, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE DOES NOT DEPICT THE AMOUNT THAT ACCRUES DIRECTLY TO THE STOCKHOLDERS' BENEFIT. ACCORDINGLY, FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE SHOULD NEVER BE CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME, NET INCOME AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS, OR NET INCOME AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE AS INDICATORS OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  THE COMPANY'S PRESENTATION OF FFO IS CONSISTENT WITH FFO AS DEFINED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, WHICH IS CALCULATED AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  NET INCOME/(LOSS) COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP;  \u2022  LESS NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES;  \u2022  PLUS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES;  \u2022  LESS GAINS, OR PLUS LOSSES, FROM SALES OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES, PLUS IMPAIRMENTS ON DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES AND EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS UNDER GAAP;  \u2022  PLUS OR MINUS OUR SHARE OF ADJUSTMENTS, INCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES, FOR UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS (TO REFLECT FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ON THE SAME BASIS); AND  \u2022  PLUS OR MINUS ADJUSTMENTS FOR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND GAINS/(LOSSES) ON SALES OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES, PLUS IMPAIRMENTS ON DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES, AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES RELATED TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  IN CALCULATING FFO, THE COMPANY INCLUDES NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS CONSISTENT WITH STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICE FOR REITS THAT OPERATE THROUGH AN UPREIT STRUCTURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO PRESENT FFO ON AN AS-CONVERTED BASIS SINCE ALL OF THE COMMON UNITS NOT OWNED BY THE COMPANY ARE REDEEMABLE ON A ONE-FOR-ONE BASIS FOR SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE COMPANY'S FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS).

U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS ARE PRESENTED IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS OR AS OTHERWISE NOTED.  OVERVIEW  ARMOUR IS A MARYLAND CORPORATION FORMED TO INVEST IN AND MANAGE A LEVERAGED PORTFOLIO OF MBS AND MORTGAGE LOANS. WE INVEST IN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY A U.S. GSE, SUCH AS FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC, OR A GOVERNMENT AGENCY SUCH AS GINNIE MAE (COLLECTIVELY, AGENCY SECURITIES). THE AGENCY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FIXED RATE HOME LOANS, THE REMAINING ARE EITHER BACKED BY HYBRID ADJUSTABLE RATE OR ADJUSTABLE RATE HOME LOANS. OTHER SECURITIES BACKED BY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES IN WHICH WE INVEST, FOR WHICH THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS NOT GUARANTEED BY A GSE OR GOVERNMENT AGENCY MAY BENEFIT FROM CREDIT ENHANCEMENT DERIVED FROM STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS SUCH AS SUBORDINATION, OVER COLLATERALIZATION OR INSURANCE (COLLECTIVELY, \"CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES\"). FROM TIME TO TIME WE MAY ALSO INVEST IN INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS. \"AGENCY SECURITIES\" TOGETHER WITH \"CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES\" AND \"INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES\", ARE COLLECTIVELY \"MBS\". THE COMPANY IS MANAGED BY ACM, AN INVESTMENT ADVISOR REGISTERED WITH THE SEC (SEE  NOTE 11  AND  NOTE 16  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).  WE SEEK TO CREATE SHAREHOLDER VALUE THROUGH THOUGHTFUL INVESTMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT PRODUCES CURRENT YIELD AND SUPERIOR RISK ADJUSTED RETURNS OVER THE LONG TERM. OUR FOCUS ON RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE FINANCE SUPPORTS HOME OWNERSHIP FOR A BROAD AND DIVERSE SPECTRUM OF AMERICANS BY BRINGING PRIVATE CAPITAL INTO THE MORTGAGE MARKETS.  WE EARN RETURNS ON THE SPREAD BETWEEN THE YIELD ON OUR ASSETS AND OUR COSTS, INCLUDING THE INTEREST COST OF THE FUNDS WE BORROW, AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO OUR HEDGES. WE IDENTIFY AND ACQUIRE MBS, FINANCE OUR ACQUISITIONS WITH BORROWINGS UNDER A SERIES OF SHORT-TERM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AT THE MOST COMPETITIVE INTEREST RATES AVAILABLE TO US AND THEN COST-EFFECTIVELY HEDGE OUR INTEREST RATE AND OTHER RISKS BASED ON OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES AND OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S VIEW OF THE MARKET. SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS APPROACH REQUIRES US TO ADDRESS INTEREST RATE RISK, MAINTAIN ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND EFFECTIVELY HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISKS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE MARKET WILL UNDERGO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE COMING YEARS AS THE ROLE OF GSES, SUCH AS FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC, IS DIMINISHED, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL CREATE ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR US. WE EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH OUR INTENTION OF CONTINUING TO QUALIFY AS A REIT UNDER THE CODE AND AVOIDING REGULATION AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE 1940 ACT.  WE HAVE ELECTED TO BE TAXED AS A REIT UNDER THE CODE. WE WILL GENERALLY NOT BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL INCOME TAX TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DISTRIBUTE OUR TAXABLE INCOME TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND AS LONG AS WE SATISFY THE ONGOING REIT REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE CODE INCLUDING MEETING CERTAIN ASSET, INCOME AND STOCK OWNERSHIP TESTS.  FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR NET INTEREST INCOME, THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND THE SUPPLY OF AND DEMAND FOR SUCH ASSETS. RECENT EVENTS, SUCH AS THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW, CAN AFFECT OUR BUSINESS IN WAYS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND MAY PRODUCE RESULTS OUTSIDE OF TYPICAL OPERATING VARIANCES. OUR NET INTEREST INCOME VARIES PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, BORROWING COSTS AND PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, THE BEHAVIOR OF WHICH INVOLVES VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. WE LOOK TO INVEST ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS, FROM AGENCY SECURITIES, FOR WHICH THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE GUARANTEED BY A GSE, TO CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES, NON-PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS AND UNRATED EQUITY TRANCHES OF CMBS. AS SUCH, WE EXPECT OUR INVESTMENTS TO BE SUBJECT TO RISKS ARISING FROM DELINQUENCIES AND FORECLOSURES, THEREBY EXPOSING  37  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO POTENTIAL LOSSES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO CHANGING CREDIT SPREADS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS. WE BELIEVE ACM\u2019S IN-DEPTH INVESTMENT EXPERTISE ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS OF THE MORTGAGE MARKET, PRUDENT ASSET SELECTION AND OUR HEDGING STRATEGY ENABLE US TO MINIMIZE OUR CREDIT LOSSES, OUR MARKET VALUE LOSSES AND FINANCING COSTS. PREPAYMENT RATES, AS REFLECTED BY THE RATE OF PRINCIPAL PAY DOWNS AND INTEREST RATES VARY ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF INVESTMENT, CONDITIONS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS, GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, COMPETITION AND OTHER FACTORS, NONE OF WHICH CAN BE PREDICTED WITH ANY CERTAINTY. IN GENERAL, AS PREPAYMENT RATES ON OUR ASSETS THAT ARE PURCHASED AT A PREMIUM INCREASE, RELATED PURCHASE PREMIUM AMORTIZATION INCREASES, THEREBY REDUCING THE NET YIELD ON SUCH ASSETS. BECAUSE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ACTIVITIES, OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND, IN LARGE PART, UPON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISKS AND PREPAYMENT RISKS EFFECTIVELY WHILE MAINTAINING OUR STATUS AS A REIT.  FOR ANY PERIOD DURING WHICH CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATES EARNED ON OUR ASSETS DO NOT COINCIDE WITH INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON OUR BORROWINGS, SUCH ASSETS WILL TEND TO REPRICE MORE SLOWLY THAN THE CORRESPONDING LIABILITIES. CONSEQUENTLY, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, PARTICULARLY SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES, MAY SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE OUR NET INTEREST INCOME. WITH THE MATURITIES OF OUR ASSETS GENERALLY OF A LONGER TERM THAN THOSE OF OUR LIABILITIES, INTEREST RATE INCREASES WILL TEND TO DECREASE OUR NET INTEREST INCOME AND THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR ASSETS (AND THEREFORE OUR BOOK VALUE). SUCH RATE INCREASES COULD POSSIBLY RESULT IN OPERATING LOSSES OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS.  PREPAYMENTS ON MBS AND THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGE LOANS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES AND A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS, POLICY DECISIONS BY REGULATORS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. TO THE EXTENT WE HOLD MBS ACQUIRED AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO PAR, OR FACE VALUE, CHANGES IN PREPAYMENT RATES MAY IMPACT OUR ANTICIPATED YIELD. IN PERIODS OF DECLINING INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENTS ON OUR MBS WILL LIKELY INCREASE. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REINVEST THE PROCEEDS OF SUCH PREPAYMENTS AT COMPARABLE YIELDS, OUR NET INTEREST INCOME MAY DECLINE. THE CLIMATE OF GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IN THE MORTGAGE MARKETS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH PREPAYMENTS.  WHILE WE USE STRATEGIES TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE SOME OF OUR INTEREST RATE RISK, WE DO NOT HEDGE ALL OF OUR EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND PREPAYMENT RATES, AS THERE ARE PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO INSULATE OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO FROM ALL POTENTIAL NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES IN A MANNER THAT WILL ALLOW US TO SEEK ATTRACTIVE NET SPREADS ON OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. ALSO, SINCE WE HAVE NOT ELECTED TO USE CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING, EARNINGS REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP WILL FLUCTUATE EVEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE OUR DERIVATIVES ARE OPERATING AS INTENDED. AS A RESULT OF THIS MARK-TO-MARKET ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE LIKELY TO FLUCTUATE FAR MORE THAN IF WE WERE TO DESIGNATE OUR DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. COMPARISONS WITH COMPANIES THAT USE CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR ALL OR PART OF THEIR DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES MAY NOT BE MEANINGFUL. FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED UNDER THE SECTION CAPTIONED \u201cDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\u201d BELOW, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR DERIVATIVES WILL HAVE THE DESIRED BENEFICIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  IN ADDITION TO THE USE OF DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISK, A VARIETY OF OTHER FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS MAY ALSO IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE; THESE FACTORS INCLUDE  \u2022  OUR DEGREE OF LEVERAGE;  \u2022  OUR ACCESS TO FUNDING AND BORROWING CAPACITY;  \u2022  THE REIT REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE CODE; AND  \u2022  THE REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY FOR AN EXCLUSION UNDER THE 1940 ACT AND OTHER REGULATORY AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS.  OUR MANAGER  SEE  NOTE 11  AND  NOTE 16  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  38  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  MARKET AND INTEREST RATE TRENDS AND THE EFFECT ON OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO  DEVELOPMENTS AT FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC  THE PAYMENTS WE RECEIVE ON THE AGENCY SECURITIES IN WHICH WE INVEST DEPEND UPON A STEADY STREAM OF PAYMENTS BY BORROWERS ON THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES AND THE FULFILLMENT OF GUARANTEES BY GSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S INTERVENTION IN FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC WILL CONTINUE TO BE ADEQUATE OR ASSURED FOR THE LONGER-TERM VIABILITY OF THESE GSES. THESE UNCERTAINTIES MAY LEAD TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF AND TRADING MARKET FOR AGENCY SECURITIES IN THE LONG TERM. ACCORDINGLY, IF THE GSES DEFAULTED ON THEIR GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS, SUFFERED LOSSES OR CEASED TO EXIST, THE VALUE OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES AND OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  THE PASSAGE OF ANY NEW FEDERAL LEGISLATION AFFECTING FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC MAY CREATE MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND REDUCE THE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED CREDIT QUALITY OF SECURITIES ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY THEM. IF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC WERE REFORMED OR WOUND DOWN, IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT EFFECT, IF ANY, THIS WOULD HAVE ON THE VALUE OF THE EXISTING FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC AGENCY SECURITIES. THE FOREGOING COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICING, SUPPLY, LIQUIDITY AND VALUE OF THE AGENCY SECURITIES IN WHICH WE INVEST AND OTHERWISE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  ON JUNE 3, 2019, FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC STARTED ISSUING A NEW COMMON SECURITY, THE UNIFORM MBS, IN PLACE OF THEIR PREVIOUS OFFERINGS OF MBS. THE NEW UNIFORM MBS WAS ISSUED USING A NEW COMMON SECURITIZATION PLATFORM (\"CSP\"). THE UNIFORM MBS MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLES THE PREVIOUS FANNIE MAE MBS AND HAS BECOME THE BASIS FOR THE TBA MBS MARKET PLACE. PREVIOUSLY EXISTING FREDDIE MAC MBS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR EXCHANGE INTO THE NEW UNIFORM MBS. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW UNIFORM MBS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR EXISTING MBS AND WE DO NOT EXPECT OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO TO BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED IN THE FUTURE. AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY UNIFORM MBS SECURITIES.  SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES AND FUNDING COSTS  CHANGES IN FED POLICY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, SINCE OUR COST OF FUNDS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON SHORT-TERM RATES. AN INCREASE IN OUR COST OF FUNDS WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON OUR MBS WOULD CAUSE OUR NET INCOME TO DECLINE. BELOW IS THE FED'S TARGET RANGE FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AT EACH FED MEETING SINCE DECEMBER 2015. THE FED'S TARGET RANGE HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE ITS DECEMBER 2018 MEETING.  MEETING DATE  LOWER RANGE  HIGHER RANGE  JUNE 2019  2.25%  2.50%  APRIL/MAY 2019  2.25%  2.50%  MARCH 2019  2.25%  2.50%  JANUARY 2019  2.25%  2.50%  DECEMBER 2018  2.25%  2.50%  SEPTEMBER 2018  2.00%  2.25%  JUNE 2018  1.75%  2.00%  MARCH 2018  1.50%  1.75%  JANUARY 2018  1.25%  1.50%  JUNE 2017  1.00%  1.25%  MARCH 2017  0.75%  1.00%  DECEMBER 2016  0.50%  0.75%  DECEMBER 2015  0.25%  0.50%  OUR BORROWINGS IN THE REPURCHASE MARKET HAVE ALSO HISTORICALLY CLOSELY TRACKED THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AND LIBOR. TRADITIONALLY, A LOWER FEDERAL FUNDS RATE HAS INDICATED A TIME OF INCREASED NET INTEREST MARGIN AND HIGHER ASSET VALUES. VOLATILITY IN THESE RATES AND DIVERGENCE FROM THE HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP AMONG THESE RATES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE  39  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. IF RATES WERE TO INCREASE AS A RESULT, OUR NET INTEREST MARGIN AND THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO MIGHT SUFFER AS A RESULT.  THE FOLLOWING GRAPH SHOWS 30-DAY LIBOR AS COMPARED TO THE EFFECTIVE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ON A MONTHLY BASIS FROM  JUNE 30, 2017  TO  JUNE 30, 2019.  LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES AND MORTGAGE SPREADS  OUR SECURITIES ARE VALUED AT AN INTEREST RATE SPREAD VERSUS LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES (MORTGAGE SPREAD). THIS MORTGAGE SPREAD VARIES OVER TIME AND CAN BE ABOVE OR BELOW LONG-TERM AVERAGES, DEPENDING UPON MARKET PARTICIPANTS' CURRENT DESIRE TO OWN SECURITIES OVER OTHER INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES. WHEN THE MORTGAGE SPREAD GETS SMALLER (OR NEGATIVE) VERSUS LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES, OUR BOOK VALUE WILL BE POSITIVELY AFFECTED. WHEN THIS SPREAD GETS LARGER (OR POSITIVE), OUR BOOK VALUE WILL BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.  MORTGAGE SPREADS CAN VARY DUE TO MOVEMENTS IN SECURITIES VALUATIONS, MOVEMENTS IN LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH. WE MAINLY USE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS (INCLUDING SWAPTIONS) TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR SECURITIES. WE DO NOT USE SUCH HEDGING CONTRACTS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES. AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD NOT ENTERED INTO ANY CONTRACT OR PURCHASED ANY ASSET SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO OFFSET THE IMPACT OF MORTGAGE SPREADS ON OUR BOOK VALUE.  40  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NET INCOME (LOSS) SUMMARY  THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  THE INCREASE IN OUR AVERAGE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND ASSET YIELDS OFFSET THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE ON OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, WHICH LED TO THE INCREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  . FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME (LOSS) WAS LARGELY DUE TO LOSSES ON OUR DERIVATIVES DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, AGGREGATE NOTIONAL BALANCES AND TBA PRICES.  41  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  NET INTEREST INCOME  NET INTEREST INCOME IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO SIZE AND NET INTEREST RATE SPREAD.  2019  VS.  2018  \u2022  OUR AVERAGE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO INCREASED BY  23.48%  FROM  $10,117,741  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  TO  $12,493,537  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019.  \u2022  OUR AVERAGE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO YIELDS INCREASED BY  0.6%  AND OUR INTEREST EXPENSE ON OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS INCREASED BY  0.8%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018.  \u2022  THE COMBINATION OF THE INCREASE IN OUR AVERAGE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, THE INCREASE IN OUR PORTFOLIO YIELD PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE ON OUR FINANCING CAUSED NET INTEREST INCOME TO INCREASE FROM 2018 TO 2019. OUR NET INTEREST RATE SPREAD WAS  1.40%  AND  1.56%  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2018.  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , OUR AGENCY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WERE CARRIED AT A NET PREMIUM TO PAR VALUE WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE AMORTIZED COST OF  102.6%  AND  103.0%  , RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATES ON THESE SECURITIES BEING HIGHER THAN PREVAILING MARKET RATES.  42  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE COMPONENTS OF THE YIELD EARNED ON OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIODS ENDED ON THE DATES SHOWN BELOW.  43  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  THE YIELD ON OUR ASSETS IS MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE RATE OF REPAYMENTS ON OUR AGENCY SECURITIES. THE FOLLOWING GRAPH SHOWS THE ANNUALIZED CPR ON A MONTHLY BASIS FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIODS ENDED ON THE DATES SHOWN BELOW.  44  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  2019  VS.  2018  \u2022  LOSSES ON AGENCY SECURITIES RESULTED FROM THE SALES OF AGENCY SECURITIES DURING THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  OF  $96,725  AND  $1,114,121  . SALES WERE  $1,236,423  AND  $2,373,507  , INCLUSIVE OF (  $216,292  RECEIVABLE FOR UNSETTLED SALES IN THE SECOND QUARTER) FOR  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018.  \u2022  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2018  , WE ALSO CONSIDERED WHETHER WE INTENDED TO SELL AGENCY SECURITIES AND WHETHER IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE COULD MEET OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT SELLING AGENCY SECURITIES.  NO  OTTI WAS RECOGNIZED FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  . FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , WE RECOGNIZED ADDITIONAL LOSSES ON AGENCY SECURITIES, PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED DURING 2017, TOTALING  $(12,090)  IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. WE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO OTTI OF OUR REMAINING AGENCY SECURITIES AT  JUNE 30, 2018.  \u2022  LOSSES ON CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES RESULTED FROM THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES.  \u2022  GAIN (LOSS) ON INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES RESULTED FROM THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE SECURITIES IN Q1 2019 OF  $682  AS WELL AS THE SALE OF  $18,822  INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES IN Q2 2019, WHICH RESULTED IN A LOSS OF  $(805).  \u2022  GAIN (LOSS) ON U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES RESULTED FROM THE SALES OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES DURING THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  OF  $1,329,660  AND  $1,529,105  , WHICH RESULTED IN REALIZED GAINS OF  $3,453  AND  $2,703  , RESPECTIVELY.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  EXPENSES  THE COMPANY IS MANAGED BY ACM, PURSUANT TO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH ARMOUR AND JAVELIN. THE ARMOUR MANAGEMENT FEES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON GROSS EQUITY RAISED. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT FEES INCREASE WHEN WE RAISE CAPITAL AND DECLINE WHEN WE REPURCHASE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED STOCK AND LIQUIDATE DISTRIBUTIONS AS APPROVED AND SO DESIGNATED BY A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE ARMOUR MANAGEMENT FEE RATE DECREASES TO 0.75% PER ANNUM FOR GROSS EQUITY RAISED IN EXCESS OF $1.0 BILLION PURSUANT TO THE ARMOUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, THE EFFECTIVE AVERAGE MANAGEMENT FEE RATE DECLINES AS EQUITY IS RAISED. GROSS EQUITY RAISED WAS  $2,979,026  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  $2,620,693  AT  JUNE 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  47  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  PROFESSIONAL FEES INCLUDE SECURITIES CLEARING, LEGAL, AUDIT AND CONSULTING COSTS AND ARE GENERALLY DRIVEN BY THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WE EXECUTE AND THE EXTENT OF RESEARCH AND DUE DILIGENCE ACTIVITIES WE UNDERTAKE ON POTENTIAL TRANSACTIONS.  INSURANCE INCLUDES PREMIUMS FOR BOTH GENERAL BUSINESS AND DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY COVERAGE. THE FLUCTUATION FROM YEAR TO YEAR IS DUE TO CHANGES IN PREMIUMS.  COMPENSATION INCLUDES BOTH NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION AS WELL AS THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AWARDED TO OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER ACM EMPLOYEES THROUGH ACM. FLUCTUATIONS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD ARE DUE TO A COMBINATION OF THE CHANGE IN OUR STOCK PRICE AND THE NUMBER OF AWARDS VESTING TO OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER ACM EMPLOYEES.  OTHER EXPENSES INCLUDE FEES FOR MARKET AND PRICING DATA, ANALYTICS AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND PORTFOLIO RELATED DATA PROCESSING COSTS AS WELL AS STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING FEES AND SIMILAR STOCKHOLDER RELATED EXPENSES, NET OF OTHER MISCELLANEOUS INCOME.

AGENCY SECURITIES, INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES AND TBA AGENCY SECURITIES  SECURITY PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING PURCHASES AND SALES FOR FORWARD SETTLEMENT, ARE RECORDED ON THE TRADE DATE TO THE EXTENT IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL TAKE OR MAKE TIMELY PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE RELATED SECURITIES. GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED FROM THE SALE OF SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME AND ARE DETERMINED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. WE TYPICALLY PURCHASE AGENCY SECURITIES AT PREMIUM PRICES. THE PREMIUM PRICE PAID OVER PAR VALUE ON THOSE ASSETS IS EXPENSED AS THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES EXPERIENCE REPAYMENT OR PREPAYMENT. THE LOWER THE CONSTANT PREPAYMENT RATE, THE LOWER THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, THE YIELD ON AN ASSET AND EARNINGS ARE HIGHER. IF PREPAYMENT RATES INCREASE, THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD WILL GO UP. THESE INCREASED PREPAYMENT RATES WOULD ACT TO DECREASE THE YIELD ON AN ASSET AND WOULD DECREASE EARNINGS.  WE ACCOUNT FOR TBA AGENCY SECURITIES AS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IF IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL NOT TAKE OR MAKE PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE AGENCY SECURITY UPON SETTLEMENT OF THE CONTRACT. TBA AGENCY SECURITIES ARE FORWARD CONTRACTS FOR THE PURCHASE (\u201cLONG POSITION\u201d) OR SALE (\u201cSHORT POSITION\u201d) OF AGENCY SECURITIES AT A PREDETERMINED PRICE, FACE AMOUNT, ISSUER, COUPON AND STATED MATURITY ON AN AGREED-UPON FUTURE DATE.

WE DID NOT HAVE ANY INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES OR TBA AGENCY SECURITIES AT  JUNE 30, 2019.  RECOGNITION OF INTEREST INCOME COMMENCES ON THE SETTLEMENT DATE OF THE PURCHASE TRANSACTION AND CONTINUES THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT DATE OF THE SALE TRANSACTION.

AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY INVESTMENT RELATED PAYABLES OR RECEIVABLES.  51  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  OUR NET INTEREST INCOME IS PRIMARILY A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE YIELD ON OUR ASSETS AND THE FINANCING (BORROWING AND HEDGING) COST OF OWNING THOSE ASSETS. SINCE WE TEND TO PURCHASE AGENCY SECURITIES AT A PREMIUM TO PAR, THE MAIN ITEM THAT CAN AFFECT THE YIELD ON OUR AGENCY SECURITIES AFTER THEY ARE PURCHASED IS THE RATE AT WHICH THE MORTGAGE BORROWERS REPAY THE LOAN. WHILE THE SCHEDULED REPAYMENTS, WHICH ARE THE PRINCIPAL PORTION OF THE HOMEOWNERS\u2019 REGULAR MONTHLY PAYMENTS, ARE FAIRLY PREDICTABLE, THE UNSCHEDULED REPAYMENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY REFINANCING OF THE MORTGAGE BUT CAN ALSO RESULT FROM REPURCHASES OF DELINQUENT, DEFAULTED, OR MODIFIED LOANS, ARE LESS SO. BEING ABLE TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE AND MANAGE THESE REPAYMENT RATES IS A CRITICAL PORTION OF THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, NOT ONLY FOR ESTIMATING CURRENT YIELD BUT ALSO FOR CONSIDERING THE RATE OF REINVESTMENT OF THOSE PROCEEDS INTO NEW SECURITIES, THE YIELDS WHICH THOSE NEW SECURITIES MAY ADD TO OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND OUR HEDGING STRATEGY.  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE ADJUSTABLE AND HYBRID ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE LOANS UNDERLYING OUR AGENCY SECURITIES HAD FIXED-INTEREST RATES FOR AN AVERAGE PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY  7 MONTHS  AND  8  MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY, AFTER WHICH TIME THE INTEREST RATES RESET AND BECOME ADJUSTABLE. AFTER A RESET DATE, INTEREST RATES ON OUR ADJUSTABLE AND HYBRID ADJUSTABLE AGENCY SECURITIES FLOAT BASED ON SPREADS OVER VARIOUS INDICES, TYPICALLY LIBOR OR THE ONE-YEAR CONSTANT MATURITY TREASURY RATE. THESE INTEREST RATES ARE SUBJECT TO CAPS THAT LIMIT THE AMOUNT THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE CAN INCREASE DURING ANY YEAR, KNOWN AS AN ANNUAL CAP AND THROUGH THE MATURITY OF THE SECURITY, KNOWN AS A LIFETIME CAP.  CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES  WE PURCHASE CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES AT PRICES WHICH INCORPORATE OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DEFAULTS, DELINQUENCIES AND SEVERITIES. THESE EXPECTATIONS DETERMINE THE YIELDS WE RECEIVE ON OUR ASSETS. IF ACTUAL PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DEFAULTS, DELINQUENCIES AND SEVERITIES ARE DIFFERENT FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS, OUR ACTUAL YIELDS COULD BE HIGHER OR LOWER.

WHILE U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES PROVIDE OVERALL INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE, THEY ARE GENERALLY NOT SENSITIVE TO THE OTHER RISKS INHERENT IN MBS. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AT  JUNE 30, 2019.  THE TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018.

OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE SECURED BY OUR AGENCY SECURITIES AND BEAR INTEREST AT RATES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY MOVED IN CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AND LIBOR. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BORROWING RELATIONSHIPS WITH NUMEROUS INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS AND OTHER LENDERS,  26  AND  23  OF WHICH HAD OPEN REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH US AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS REQUIRE EXCESS COLLATERAL, KNOWN AS A \u201cHAIRCUT.\u201d AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE AVERAGE HAIRCUT PERCENTAGE WAS  4.91%  COMPARED TO  5.48%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THE CHANGE IN THE AVERAGE HAIRCUT PERCENTAGE REFLECTS BETTER FINANCING OF SOME OF OUR CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES AS THE CREDIT RATING HAS INCREASED FROM NON-INVESTMENT GRADE TO INVESTMENT GRADE ON THOSE SECURITIES.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  WE USE VARIOUS INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS TO MANAGE OUR INTEREST RATE RISK AS WE DEEM PRUDENT IN LIGHT OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE ASSOCIATED COSTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A HIGH QUALITY CREDIT RATING AND WITH FUTURES EXCHANGES. WE GENERALLY PAY A FIXED RATE AND RECEIVE A FLOATING RATE WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF FIXING A PORTION OF OUR BORROWING COSTS AND HEDGING THE CHANGE IN OUR BOOK VALUE TO SOME DEGREE. THE FLOATING RATE WE RECEIVE IS GENERALLY THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE OR LIBOR. OUR POLICIES DO NOT CONTAIN SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AS TO THE PERCENTAGES OR AMOUNT OF INTEREST RATE RISK THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO HEDGE. FOR INTEREST RATE RISK MITIGATION PURPOSES, WE CONSIDER AGENCY SECURITIES TO BE ARMS IF THEIR INTEREST RATE IS EITHER CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT ACCORDING TO PREVAILING RATES OR IF THEY ARE WITHIN 18 MONTHS OF THE PERIOD WHERE SUCH ADJUSTMENTS WILL OCCUR. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR DERIVATIVES WILL HAVE THE DESIRED BENEFICIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE HAVE NOT ELECTED CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AS ALLOWED BY GAAP. SINCE WE DO NOT DESIGNATE OUR DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, REALIZED AS WELL AS UNREALIZED GAINS/LOSSES FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS WILL IMPACT OUR GAAP EARNINGS.  USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY FAIL TO PROTECT OR COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US BECAUSE, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  AVAILABLE DERIVATIVES MAY NOT CORRESPOND DIRECTLY WITH THE INTEREST RATE RISK FOR WHICH PROTECTION IS SOUGHT (E.G., THE DIFFERENCE IN INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS FOR LONG-TERM U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES COMPARED TO AGENCY SECURITIES);  \u2022  THE DURATION OF THE DERIVATIVES MAY NOT MATCH THE DURATION OF THE RELATED LIABILITY;  \u2022  THE COUNTERPARTY TO A DERIVATIVE AGREEMENT WITH US MAY DEFAULT ON ITS OBLIGATION TO PAY OR NOT PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT AND THE COLLATERAL POSTED MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT AGAINST ANY CONSEQUENT LOSS;  \u2022  WE MAY LOSE COLLATERAL WE HAVE PLEDGED TO SECURE OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER A DERIVATIVE AGREEMENT IF THE ASSOCIATED COUNTERPARTY BECOMES INSOLVENT OR FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY;  \u2022  WE MAY EXPERIENCE A TERMINATION EVENT UNDER ONE OR MORE OF OUR DERIVATIVE AGREEMENTS RELATED TO OUR REIT STATUS, EQUITY LEVELS AND PERFORMANCE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A PAYOUT TO THE ASSOCIATED COUNTERPARTY AND A TAXABLE LOSS TO US;  54  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.

AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD TBA AGENCY SECURITIES WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL BALANCE OF  $900,000  . WE DID NOT HAVE ANY TBA AGENCY SECURITIES AT  JUNE 30, 2019  . COUNTERPARTY RISK OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS AND INTEREST RATE SWAPTIONS ARE LIMITED TO SOME DEGREE BECAUSE OF DAILY MARK-TO-MARKET AND COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS. THESE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE DESIGNED TO LOCK IN A PORTION OF FUNDING COSTS FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ASSETS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO HELP ASSURE THE REALIZATION OF ATTRACTIVE NET INTEREST MARGINS AND TO VARY INVERSELY IN VALUE WITH OUR MBS. SUCH CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PREPAYMENTS WHICH, IF NOT REALIZED, WILL CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM EXPECTATIONS.  ALTHOUGH WE ATTEMPT TO STRUCTURE OUR DERIVATIVES TO OFFSET THE CHANGES IN ASSET PRICES, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ACTUAL AND EXPECTED PRE-PAYMENT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES AS WELL AS THE VOLATILITY IN MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES RELATIVE TO U.S. TREASURY AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT RATES MAKES ACHIEVING HIGH LEVELS OF OFF-SET DIFFICULT.

FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , THE NET UNREALIZED GAIN (LOSS) OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES DECREASED BY  $(49,587)  AND  $(194,997)  . THE NET UNREALIZED GAIN (LOSS) ON AGENCY SECURITIES IS DUE TO MARKET PRICE FLUCTUATIONS.  AS REQUIRED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED RULES REQUIRING CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS TO BE CLEARED THROUGH A DERIVATIVES CLEARING ORGANIZATION. WE ARE REQUIRED TO CLEAR CERTAIN NEW INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. CLEARED INTEREST RATE SWAPS MAY HAVE HIGHER MARGIN REQUIREMENTS THAN UN-CLEARED INTEREST RATE SWAPS WE PREVIOUSLY HAD. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN ACCOUNT WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT FOR THIS PURPOSE. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO ANY CLEARED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS.  WE ARE REQUIRED TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR TBA AGENCY SECURITIES AS DERIVATIVES WHEN IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL NOT TAKE OR MAKE TIMELY PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE RELATED SECURITIES.

OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF FUNDS ARE BORROWINGS UNDER REPURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS, MONTHLY PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON OUR AGENCY SECURITIES AND CASH GENERATED FROM OUR OPERATING RESULTS. OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS MAY INCLUDE PROCEEDS FROM EQUITY AND DEBT OFFERINGS AND ASSET SALES (SEE  NOTE 13  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). WE GENERALLY MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY TO PAY DOWN BORROWINGS UNDER REPURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS TO REDUCE BORROWING COSTS AND OTHERWISE EFFICIENTLY MANAGE OUR LONG-TERM INVESTMENT CAPITAL. BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF OUR BORROWINGS CAN BE ADJUSTED ON A DAILY BASIS, THE LEVEL OF CASH CARRIED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IMPORTANT THAN OUR POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE UNDER OUR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS.  OUR PRIMARY USES OF CASH ARE TO PURCHASE MBS, PAY INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL ON OUR BORROWINGS, FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND PAY DIVIDENDS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE PURCHASE OR SELL ASSETS FOR FORWARD SETTLEMENT UP TO 90 DAYS IN THE FUTURE TO LOCK IN PURCHASE PRICES OR SALES PROCEEDS. WE GENERALLY SEEK TO BORROW (ON A RECOURSE BASIS) BETWEEN SIX AND TEN TIMES THE AMOUNT OF OUR TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE FINANCED OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WITH  $13,296,846  AND  $7,037,651  OF BORROWINGS UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, RESPECTIVELY. OUR LEVERAGE RATIOS AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WERE  9.66  :1 AND  6.25:1  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR LEVERAGE RATIO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AT PERIOD END BY TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AT PERIOD END.  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE PURCHASED  $9,398,749  OF SECURITIES USING PROCEEDS FROM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS. DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE RECEIVED CASH OF  $475,430  FROM PREPAYMENTS AND SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR MBS. WE HAD A NET CASH DECREASE FROM OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OF  57  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  $6,259,195  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND MADE CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $187,005  ON OUR LIABILITIES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019.  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , WE PURCHASED  $2,360,577  OF SECURITIES USING PROCEEDS FROM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS. DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , WE RECEIVED CASH OF  $348,226  FROM PREPAYMENTS AND SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR MBS. WE HAD A NET CASH DECREASE FROM OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OF  $(1,301,728)  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  AND MADE CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $91,941  ON OUR LIABILITIES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018.  WE HAVE CONTINUED TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL LENDING COUNTERPARTIES IN ORDER TO HELP INCREASE OUR FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND ABILITY TO WITHSTAND PERIODS OF CONTRACTING LIQUIDITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS.  CASH AND CASH COLLATERAL POSTED TO COUNTERPARTIES PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $(43,544)  AND  $17,277  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH COLLATERAL POSTED TO COUNTERPARTIES RELATED TO OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN NET GAIN (LOSS) ON OUR DERIVATIVES AND REALIZED LOSSES ON SALES OF AGENCY SECURITIES. OUR AVERAGE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WAS  $12,493,537  AND  $10,117,741  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE SOLD  16,064  OF COMMON SHARES UNDER TWO UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND OUR COMMON STOCK ATM SALES AGREEMENT, FOR AN INCREASE IN EQUITY OF  $321,892  . DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE SOLD  $136  SHARES UNDER THE PREFERRED B ATM SALES AGREEMENTS AND HAD COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES OF  $(625).  IN ADDITION TO THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT FINANCING DISCUSSED ABOVE, FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAVE ENTERED INTO REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENT COUNTERPARTIES. UNDER A TYPICAL REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE PURCHASE U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES FROM A BORROWER IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH AND AGREE TO SELL THE SAME SECURITIES BACK IN THE FUTURE. WE THEN SELL SUCH U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES TO THIRD PARTIES AND RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY TO RETURN THE SECURITIES TO THE ORIGINAL BORROWER. REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT RECEIVABLES AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENT LIABILITIES ARE PRESENTED NET WHEN THEY MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA, INCLUDING BEING WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY, BEING GOVERNED BY THE SAME MRA, SETTLEMENT THROUGH THE SAME BROKERAGE OR CLEARING ACCOUNT AND MATURING ON THE SAME DAY. THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS IS TO REPLACE A PORTION OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENT FINANCING OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WITH SHORT POSITIONS IN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS HELPS TO REDUCE INTEREST RATE RISK, AND THEREFORE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISK. BOTH PARTIES TO THE REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE DAILY MARGIN CALLS BASED ON CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL OBTAINED AND/OR PLEDGED. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OUTSTANDING AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS, REPAYMENTS ON REPURCHASE BORROWINGS, REACQUISITION OF SECURITIES TO BE RETURNED TO BORROWERS AND THE PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS AS REQUIRED FOR CONTINUED QUALIFICATION AS A REIT.  REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS  DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES PORTFOLIO CAN TRIGGER MARGIN CALLS BY OUR LENDERS UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. AN EVENT OF DEFAULT OR TERMINATION EVENT UNDER THE STANDARD MRA WOULD GIVE OUR COUNTERPARTY THE OPTION TO TERMINATE ALL REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS EXISTING WITH US AND REQUIRE ANY AMOUNT DUE TO BE PAYABLE IMMEDIATELY.  CHANGING CAPITAL OR OTHER FINANCIAL MARKET REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS MAY CAUSE OUR LENDERS TO EXIT THE REPURCHASE MARKET, INCREASE FINANCING RATES, TIGHTEN LENDING STANDARDS OR INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF REQUIRED EQUITY CAPITAL OR HAIRCUT WE POST, ANY OF WHICH COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR COSTLY FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING.  FINANCIAL SECTOR VOLATILITY CAN ALSO LEAD TO INCREASED DEMAND AND PRICES FOR HIGH QUALITY DEBT SECURITIES, INCLUDING AGENCY SECURITIES. WHILE INCREASED PRICES MAY INCREASE THE VALUE OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES, HIGHER VALUES MAY ALSO REDUCE THE RETURN ON REINVESTMENT OF CAPITAL, THEREBY LOWERING OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.  58  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  THE FOLLOWING GRAPH REPRESENTS THE OUTSTANDING BALANCES OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS (BEFORE THE EFFECT OF NETTING REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS), WHICH FINANCE MOST OF OUR MBS. OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS BALANCE WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON OUR CHANGE IN CAPITAL, LEVERAGE TARGETS AND THE MARKET PRICES OF OUR ASSETS. THE BALANCE OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OUTSTANDING WILL FLUCTUATE WITHIN ANY GIVEN MONTH BASED ON CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE PARTICULAR MBS PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL (INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF PRINCIPAL PAYDOWNS) AND THE LEVEL AND TIMING OF INVESTMENT AND REINVESTMENT ACTIVITY.  SEE  NOTE 9  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION.  EFFECTS OF MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, LEVERAGE AND CREDIT SPREADS  OUR MBS HAVE VALUES THAT FLUCTUATE ACCORDING TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR MBS WILL DECREASE AS PREVAILING INTEREST RATES OR CREDIT SPREADS INCREASE. WHEN THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES PLEDGED TO SECURE A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT DECREASES TO THE POINT WHERE THE POSITIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COLLATERAL VALUE AND THE LOAN AMOUNT IS LESS THAN THE HAIRCUT, OUR LENDERS MAY ISSUE A MARGIN CALL, WHICH MEANS THAT THE LENDER WILL REQUIRE US TO PAY THE MARGIN CALL IN CASH OR PLEDGE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL TO MEET THAT MARGIN CALL. UNDER OUR REPURCHASE FACILITIES, OUR LENDERS HAVE FULL DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE MBS WE PLEDGE TO THEM. MOST OF OUR LENDERS WILL VALUE SECURITIES BASED ON RECENT TRADES IN THE MARKET. LENDERS ALSO ISSUE MARGIN CALLS AS THE PUBLISHED CURRENT PRINCIPAL BALANCE FACTORS CHANGE ON THE POOL OF MORTGAGES UNDERLYING THE SECURITIES PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL WHEN SCHEDULED AND UNSCHEDULED PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS ARE ANNOUNCED MONTHLY.  WE EXPERIENCE MARGIN CALLS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS AND UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DURING A PERIOD OF DECLINING MARKET VALUE FOR MBS AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE MARGIN CALLS AS FREQUENTLY AS DAILY. IN SEEKING TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE MARGIN REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY OUR LENDERS, WE MAINTAIN A POSITION OF CASH AND UNPLEDGED SECURITIES. WE REFER TO THIS POSITION AS OUR LIQUIDITY. THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO MEET MARGIN CALLS IS DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY OUR LEVERAGE LEVELS, OUR HAIRCUTS AND THE PRICE CHANGES ON OUR SECURITIES. IF INTEREST RATES INCREASE AS A RESULT OF A YIELD CURVE SHIFT OR FOR ANOTHER REASON OR IF CREDIT SPREADS WIDEN, THE PRICES OF OUR COLLATERAL (AND OUR UNPLEDGED ASSETS THAT CONSTITUTE OUR LIQUIDITY) WILL DECLINE AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE MARGIN CALLS. WE WILL USE OUR LIQUIDITY TO MEET SUCH MARGIN CALLS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY TO MEET ANY MARGIN CALLS. IF OUR HAIRCUTS INCREASE, OUR LIQUIDITY WILL PROPORTIONATELY DECREASE. IF WE INCREASE OUR BORROWINGS, OUR LIQUIDITY WILL DECREASE BY THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL HAIRCUT ON THE  59  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  INCREASED LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR MRAS CONTAIN A RESTRICTION THAT PROHIBITS OUR LEVERAGE FROM EXCEEDING TWELVE TIMES OUR STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AS WELL AS TERMINATION EVENTS IN THE CASE OF SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN EQUITY CAPITAL.  WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY IN RELATION TO OUR ASSETS THAT ENABLES US TO MEET REASONABLY ANTICIPATED MARGIN CALLS BUT THAT ALSO ALLOWS US TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY INVESTED IN MBS. WE MAY MISJUDGE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF OUR LIQUIDITY BY MAINTAINING EXCESSIVE LIQUIDITY, WHICH WOULD LOWER OUR INVESTMENT RETURNS, OR BY MAINTAINING INSUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY, WHICH WOULD FORCE US TO INVOLUNTARILY LIQUIDATE ASSETS INTO UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS AND HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REGARDING LIQUIDITY  BASED ON OUR CURRENT PORTFOLIO, LEVERAGE RATE AND AVAILABLE BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE TIMELY PORTFOLIO ADJUSTMENTS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE US TO MEET ANTICIPATED SHORT-TERM (ONE YEAR OR LESS) LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS TO FUND OUR INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES, MEET OUR FINANCING OBLIGATIONS, PAY FEES UNDER THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS AND FUND OUR DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS AND PAY GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES.  WE MAY INCREASE OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES BY OBTAINING LONG-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES OR MAKING PUBLIC OR PRIVATE OFFERINGS OF EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES, INCLUDING CLASSES OF PREFERRED STOCK, COMMON STOCK AND SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED NOTES TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM (GREATER THAN ONE YEAR) LIQUIDITY. SUCH FINANCING WILL DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS FOR CAPITAL RAISES AND FOR THE INVESTMENT OF ANY PROCEEDS AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL SUCCESSFULLY OBTAIN ANY SUCH FINANCING.  STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY  SEE  NOTE 13  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD NOT MAINTAINED ANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS STRUCTURED FINANCE, OR SPECIAL PURPOSE OR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES. FURTHERMORE, AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD NOT GUARANTEED ANY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR ENTERED INTO ANY COMMITMENT OR INTENT TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO ANY SUCH ENTITIES. ALL OF OUR TRANSACTIONS WITH BUCKLER ARE REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  SEE  NOTE 3  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. SEE  NOTE 4  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR RECENTLY ADOPTED CHANGES.  VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES  WE CARRY OUR MBS AND DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE. OUR AGENCY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE, AND THEREFORE UNREALIZED CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE REFLECTED DIRECTLY IN TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AS ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR LOSS. OUR CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES AND INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING SECURITIES, AND THEREFORE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS INCOME OR LOSS. WE DO NOT USE HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR OUR DERIVATIVES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND THEREFORE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE REFLECTED IN NET INCOME AS OTHER GAIN OR LOSS. TO THE EXTENT THAT FAIR VALUE CHANGES ON DERIVATIVES OFFSET FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN OUR MBS, THE FLUCTUATION IN OUR STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY WILL BE LOWER. FOR EXAMPLE, RISING INTEREST RATES MAY TEND TO RESULT IN AN OVERALL INCREASE IN OUR REPORTED NET INCOME EVEN WHILE OUR TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY DECLINES.  FAIR VALUE FOR THE AGENCY SECURITIES AND INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON OBTAINING A VALUATION FOR EACH AGENCY SECURITY FROM THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES AND/OR DEALER QUOTES. THE THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES USE COMMON MARKET PRICING METHODS THAT MAY INCLUDE PRICING MODELS THAT MAY INCORPORATE SUCH FACTORS AS COUPONS, PREPAYMENT  60  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  SPEEDS, SPREAD TO THE TREASURY CURVES AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CURVES, DURATION, PERIODIC AND LIFE CAPS AND CREDIT ENHANCEMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN AGENCY SECURITY IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM THE THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES OR SUCH DATA APPEARS UNRELIABLE, WE OBTAIN PRICING INDICATIONS FROM UP TO THREE DEALERS WHO MAKE MARKETS IN SIMILAR AGENCY SECURITIES. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS PRICING USED TO ENSURE THAT CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS ARE PROPERLY REFLECTED. THIS REVIEW INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, COMPARISONS OF SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS OR ALTERNATIVE THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES, DEALER PRICING INDICATIONS AND COMPARISONS TO A THIRD PARTY PRICING MODEL.  THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES THAT INCORPORATE COMMON MARKET PRICING METHODS THAT MAY INCLUDE CURRENT INTEREST RATE CURVES, FORWARD INTEREST RATE CURVES AND MARKET SPREADS TO INTEREST RATE CURVES. MANAGEMENT COMPARES PRICING INFORMATION RECEIVED TO DEALER QUOTES TO ENSURE THAT THE CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS ARE PROPERLY REFLECTED.  FAIR VALUE FOR THE CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON OBTAINING A VALUATION FOR EACH CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITY FROM THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES AND/OR DEALER QUOTES. THE THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES INCORPORATE SUCH FACTORS AS COLLATERAL TYPE, BOND STRUCTURE AND PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS, COUPONS, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DEFAULTS, DELINQUENCIES AND SEVERITIES. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITY IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM THE THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES OR SUCH DATA APPEARS UNRELIABLE, WE OBTAIN PRICING INDICATIONS FROM UP TO THREE DEALERS WHO MAKE MARKETS IN SIMILAR CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS PRICING USED TO ENSURE THAT CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS ARE PROPERLY REFLECTED. THIS REVIEW INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, COMPARISONS OF SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS OR ALTERNATIVE THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES, DEALER PRICING INDICATIONS AND COMPARISONS TO A THIRD PARTY PRICING MODEL.  FAIR VALUE FOR THE U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON OBTAINING A VALUATION FOR EACH U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES FROM THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES AND/OR DEALER QUOTES.  REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AGENCY SECURITIES  SECURITY PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING PURCHASES AND SALES FOR FORWARD SETTLEMENT, ARE RECORDED ON THE TRADE DATE TO THE EXTENT IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL TAKE OR MAKE TIMELY PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE RELATED SECURITIES. GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED FROM THE SALE OF SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME AND ARE DETERMINED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. WE REALIZE GAINS AND LOSSES ON OUR AGENCY SECURITIES UPON THEIR SALE. AT THAT TIME, PREVIOUSLY UNREALIZED AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ARE RECLASSIFIED AND REPORTED IN NET INCOME AS OTHER GAIN OR LOSS. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE SELL AGENCY SECURITIES IN LATER PERIODS AFTER CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE AGENCY SECURITIES HAVE OCCURRED, WE MAY REPORT SIGNIFICANT NET INCOME OR NET LOSS WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN OUR TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY.  DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES THAT REPRESENT AND OTTI ARE ALSO TREATED AS REALIZED LOSSES AND REPORTED IN NET INCOME AS OTHER LOSS. WE EVALUATE AGENCY SECURITIES FOR OTTI AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONCERNS WARRANT SUCH EVALUATION. WE CONSIDER AN IMPAIRMENT TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IF WE (1) HAVE THE INTENT TO SELL THE AGENCY SECURITIES, (2) BELIEVE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITIES BEFORE RECOVERY (FOR EXAMPLE, BECAUSE OF LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS), OR (3) A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RECOGNIZED ESTABLISH A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE RELATED AGENCY SECURITIES. GAINS OR LOSSES ON SUBSEQUENT SALES ARE DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO SUCH NEW COST BASIS.  GAINS AND LOSSES ON CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES, INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES AND U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES  WE CARRY OUR CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES AND INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES AT FAIR VALUE AND REFLECT CHANGES IN THOSE FAIR VALUES IN NET INCOME AS OTHER GAINS AND LOSSES.  WE CARRY OUR U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AT FAIR VALUE AND REFLECT CHANGES IN THOSE FAIR VALUES IN NET INCOME AS OTHER GAINS AND LOSSES.  61  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  INFLATION  VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE IN NATURE. AS A RESULT, INTEREST RATES AND OTHER FACTORS INFLUENCE OUR PERFORMANCE FAR MORE THAN INFLATION. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES DO NOT NECESSARILY CORRELATE WITH INFLATION RATES OR CHANGES IN INFLATION RATES. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND ANY DISTRIBUTIONS WE MAY MAKE WILL BE DETERMINED BY OUR BOARD BASED IN PART ON OUR REIT TAXABLE INCOME AS CALCULATED ACCORDING TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CODE; IN EACH CASE, OUR ACTIVITIES AND BALANCE SHEET ARE MEASURED WITH REFERENCE TO FAIR VALUE WITHOUT CONSIDERING INFLATION.

ESSEX OWNS ALL OF ITS INTERESTS IN ITS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. ESSEX IS THE SOLE GENERAL PARTNER OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND, AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , HAD AN APPROXIMATELY  96.6%  GENERAL PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT STRATEGY HAS TWO COMPONENTS: CONSTANT MONITORING OF EXISTING MARKETS, AND EVALUATION OF NEW MARKETS TO IDENTIFY AREAS WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT UNDERLIE RENTAL GROWTH. THE COMPANY\u2019S STRONG FINANCIAL CONDITION SUPPORTS ITS INVESTMENT STRATEGY BY ENHANCING ITS ABILITY TO QUICKLY SHIFT ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT, REDEVELOPMENT, AND DISPOSITION ACTIVITIES TO MARKETS THAT WILL OPTIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY OWNED OR HAD OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN  246  OPERATING APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, COMPRISING  59,962  APARTMENT HOMES, EXCLUDING THE COMPANY\u2019S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN PREFERRED EQUITY CO-INVESTMENTS, LOAN INVESTMENTS,  ONE  OPERATING COMMERCIAL BUILDING, AND  SIX  ACTIVE DEVELOPMENTS. THE COMPANY\u2019S APARTMENT COMMUNITIES ARE LOCATED IN THE FOLLOWING MAJOR REGIONS.  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  (LOS ANGELES, ORANGE, SAN DIEGO, AND VENTURA COUNTIES)  NORTHERN CALIFORNIA  (THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA)  SEATTLE  METRO  (SEATTLE METROPOLITAN AREA)  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE WAS COMPRISED OF  FOUR  CONSOLIDATED PROJECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT,  TWO  UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT, AND VARIOUS CONSOLIDATED PREDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AGGREGATING  1,853  APARTMENT HOMES, WITH TOTAL INCURRED COSTS OF  $1.0 BILLION  , AND ESTIMATED REMAINING PROJECT COSTS OF  $0.2 BILLION  , $0.2 BILLION OF WHICH REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED REMAINING COSTS, FOR TOTAL ESTIMATED PROJECT COSTS OF  $1.2 BILLION.

COMPARISON OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  THE COMPANY\u2019S AVERAGE FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S STABILIZED APARTMENT COMMUNITIES OR \"SAME-PROPERTY\" (STABILIZED PROPERTIES CONSOLIDATED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  ) WAS  96.6%  AND  96.7%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY IS DEFINED AS THE PERCENTAGE RESULTING FROM DIVIDING ACTUAL RENTAL INCOME BY TOTAL POTENTIAL RENTAL INCOME. ACTUAL RENTAL INCOME REPRESENTS CONTRACTUAL RENTAL INCOME PURSUANT TO LEASES WITHOUT CONSIDERING DELINQUENCY AND CONCESSIONS. TOTAL POTENTIAL RENTAL INCOME REPRESENTS THE VALUE OF ALL APARTMENT HOMES, WITH OCCUPIED APARTMENT HOMES VALUED AT CONTRACTUAL RENTAL RATES PURSUANT TO LEASES AND VACANT APARTMENT HOMES VALUED AT ESTIMATED MARKET RENTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY IS A MEANINGFUL MEASURE OF OCCUPANCY BECAUSE IT CONSIDERS THE VALUE OF EACH VACANT APARTMENT HOME AT ITS ESTIMATED MARKET RATE.  39  MARKET RATES ARE DETERMINED USING THE RECENTLY SIGNED EFFECTIVE RATES ON NEW LEASES AT THE PROPERTY AND ARE USED AS THE STARTING POINT IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE MARKET RATES OF VACANT APARTMENT HOMES. THE COMPANY MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE THESE RATES BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OVERALL SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR HOUSING, CONCENTRATION OF NEW APARTMENT DELIVERIES WITHIN THE SAME SUBMARKET WHICH CAN CAUSE PERIODIC DISRUPTION DUE TO GREATER RENTAL CONCESSIONS TO INCREASE LEASING VELOCITY, AND RENTAL AFFORDABILITY. FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY MAY NOT COMPLETELY REFLECT SHORT-TERM TRENDS IN PHYSICAL OCCUPANCY AND FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY RATES, AND THE COMPANY'S CALCULATION OF FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY DISCLOSED BY OTHER REITS.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT DELINQUENCY AND CONCESSIONS TO CALCULATE ACTUAL RENT FOR OCCUPIED APARTMENT HOMES AND MARKET RENTS FOR VACANT APARTMENT HOMES. THE CALCULATION OF FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY COMPARES CONTRACTUAL RATES FOR OCCUPIED APARTMENT HOMES TO ESTIMATED MARKET RENTS FOR UNOCCUPIED APARTMENT HOMES, AND THUS THE CALCULATION COMPARES THE GROSS VALUE OF ALL APARTMENT HOMES EXCLUDING DELINQUENCY AND CONCESSIONS. FOR APARTMENT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES IN LEASE-UP WITHOUT STABILIZED OCCUPANCY FIGURES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE PHYSICAL OCCUPANCY RATE IS THE APPROPRIATE PERFORMANCE METRIC. WHILE AN APARTMENT COMMUNITY IS IN THE LEASE-UP PHASE, THE COMPANY\u2019S PRIMARY MOTIVATION IS TO STABILIZE THE PROPERTY WHICH MAY ENTAIL THE USE OF RENT CONCESSIONS AND OTHER INCENTIVES, AND THUS FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY, WHICH IS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL INCOME, IS NOT CONSIDERED THE BEST METRIC TO QUANTIFY OCCUPANCY.  THE REGIONAL BREAKDOWN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SAME-PROPERTY PORTFOLIO FOR FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  IS AS FOLLOWS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS, EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES, AVAILABILITY UNDER EXISTING LINES OF CREDIT, ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM THE DISPOSITION OF REAL ESTATE ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET ALL OF ITS REASONABLY ANTICIPATED CASH NEEDS DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. THE TIMING, SOURCE AND AMOUNTS OF CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER FLUCTUATIONS IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS ENVIRONMENT, WHICH CAN AFFECT THE COMPANY'S PLANS FOR ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS, DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , FITCH RATINGS, MOODY\u2019S INVESTOR SERVICE, AND STANDARD AND POOR'S CREDIT AGENCIES RATE THE COMPANY AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, BBB+/POSITIVE, BAA1/STABLE, AND BBB+/STABLE, RESPECTIVELY.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD TWO UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT AGGREGATING $1.24 BILLION. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THERE WAS $117.0 MILLION OUTSTANDING ON THE COMPANY'S $1.2 BILLION UNSECURED LINE OF CREDIT. THE UNDERLYING INTEREST RATE IS BASED ON A TIERED RATE STRUCTURE TIED TO THE COMPANY'S CREDIT RATINGS AND WAS LIBOR PLUS 0.825% AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  . THIS FACILITY IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN DECEMBER 2022, WITH ONE 18-MONTH EXTENSION, EXERCISABLE AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THERE WAS NO AMOUNT OUTSTANDING ON THE COMPANY'S $35.0 MILLION WORKING CAPITAL UNSECURED LINE OF CREDIT. THE UNDERLYING INTEREST RATE ON THE $35.0 MILLION LINE IS BASED ON A TIERED RATE STRUCTURE TIED TO THE COMPANY'S CREDIT RATINGS AND WAS LIBOR PLUS 0.825% AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  . THIS FACILITY IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN FEBRUARY 2021.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP ISSUED $350.0 MILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE ON MARCH 1, 2029, WITH A COUPON RATE OF 4.000% (THE \"2029 NOTES\"), WHICH ARE PAYABLE ON MARCH 1 AND SEPTEMBER 1 OF EACH YEAR, BEGINNING ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2019. THE 2029 NOTES WERE OFFERED TO INVESTORS AT A PRICE OF 99.188% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT THEREOF. THE 2029 NOTES ARE GENERAL UNSECURED SENIOR OBLIGATIONS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, RANK EQUALLY IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT WITH ALL OTHER SENIOR UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND ARE UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY. IN MARCH 2019, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL $150.0 MILLION OF THE 2029 NOTES AT A PRICE OF 100.717% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT THEREOF. THESE ADDITIONAL NOTES HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL TERMS AS THE 2029 NOTES ISSUED IN FEBRUARY 2019. THE COMPANY USED THE NET PROCEEDS OF THESE OFFERINGS TO REPAY INDEBTEDNESS UNDER ITS UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT AND FOR OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE AND WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES.  IN JANUARY 2019, THE COMPANY REPAID $290.0 MILLION IN SECURED MORTGAGE NOTES PAYABLE WITH A COUPON RATE OF 5.57% AND A STATED MATURITY DATE OF MAY 2019.  43  IN SEPTEMBER 2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NEW EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY MAY OFFER AND SELL SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK HAVING AN AGGREGATE GROSS SALES PRICE OF UP TO $900.0 MILLION (THE \"2018 ATM PROGRAM\"). IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2018 ATM PROGRAM, THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER INTO RELATED FORWARD SALE AGREEMENTS WHEREBY, AT THE COMPANY\u2019S DISCRETION, IT MAY SELL SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER THE 2018 ATM PROGRAM UNDER FORWARD SALES AGREEMENTS. THE USE OF A FORWARD SALES AGREEMENT WOULD ALLOW THE COMPANY TO LOCK IN A SHARE PRICE ON THE SALE OF SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME THE AGREEMENT IS EXECUTED, BUT DEFER RECEIVING THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SHARES UNTIL A LATER DATE. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY DID NOT SELL ANY SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK THROUGH THE 2018 ATM PROGRAM. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THERE ARE NO OUTSTANDING FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND $900.0 MILLION OF SHARES REMAINS AVAILABLE TO BE SOLD UNDER THIS PROGRAM.  IN DECEMBER 2015, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN TO ALLOW THE COMPANY TO  ACQUIRE SHARES IN AN AGGREGATE OF UP TO $250.0 MILLION. IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE REPLENISHMENT OF THE STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN SUCH THAT, AS OF SUCH DATE, THE COMPANY HAD $250.0 MILLION OF PURCHASE AUTHORITY REMAINING UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 234,061 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK TOTALING $57.0 MILLION, INCLUDING COMMISSIONS, AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $243.48 PER SHARE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD $250.0 MILLION OF PURCHASE AUTHORITY REMAINING UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN.  ESSEX PAYS QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS FROM CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION. UNTIL IT IS DISTRIBUTED, CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION IS INVESTED BY THE COMPANY PRIMARILY IN INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES HELD AVAILABLE FOR SALE OR IS USED BY THE COMPANY TO REDUCE BALANCES OUTSTANDING UNDER ITS LINE OF CREDIT.  DEVELOPMENT AND PREDEVELOPMENT PIPELINE  THE COMPANY DEFINES DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AS NEW COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING CONSTRUCTED, OR ARE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED AND ARE IN A PHASE OF LEASE-UP AND HAVE NOT YET REACHED STABILIZED OPERATIONS. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE WAS COMPRISED OF  FOUR  CONSOLIDATED PROJECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT,  TWO  UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND VARIOUS CONSOLIDATED PREDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, AGGREGATING  1,853  APARTMENT HOMES, WITH TOTAL INCURRED COSTS OF  $1.0 BILLION  , AND ESTIMATED REMAINING PROJECT COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $0.2 BILLION  , $0.2 BILLION OF WHICH REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED REMAINING COSTS, FOR TOTAL ESTIMATED PROJECT COSTS OF  $1.2 BILLION.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO FUND THE DEVELOPMENT AND PREDEVELOPMENT PIPELINE BY USING A COMBINATION OF SOME OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING SOURCES: ITS WORKING CAPITAL, AMOUNTS AVAILABLE ON ITS LINES OF CREDIT, CONSTRUCTION LOANS, NET PROCEEDS FROM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EQUITY AND DEBT ISSUANCES, AND PROCEEDS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF ASSETS, IF ANY.  REDEVELOPMENT PIPELINE  THE COMPANY DEFINES REDEVELOPMENT COMMUNITIES AS EXISTING PROPERTIES OWNED OR RECENTLY ACQUIRED, WHICH HAVE BEEN TARGETED FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT BY THE COMPANY WITH THE EXPECTATION OF INCREASED FINANCIAL RETURNS THROUGH PROPERTY IMPROVEMENT. DURING REDEVELOPMENT, APARTMENT HOMES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR RENT AND, AS A RESULT, MAY HAVE LESS THAN STABILIZED OPERATIONS. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN  FIVE  MAJOR REDEVELOPMENT COMMUNITIES AGGREGATING  1,727  APARTMENT HOMES WITH ESTIMATED REDEVELOPMENT COSTS OF  $140.1 MILLION  , OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY  $22.8 MILLION  REMAINS TO BE EXPENDED. THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO CEASE FUNDING OF THE REDEVELOPMENT PIPELINE AS NEEDED.  DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY  THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, INTEREST RATE CAPS, AND TOTAL RETURN SWAP CONTRACTS TO MANAGE CERTAIN INTEREST RATE RISKS. THE VALUATION OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS DETERMINED USING WIDELY ACCEPTED VALUATION TECHNIQUES INCLUDING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS ON THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS OF EACH DERIVATIVE. THIS ANALYSIS REFLECTS THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING THE PERIOD TO MATURITY, AND USES OBSERVABLE MARKET-BASED INPUTS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE CURVES. THE FAIR VALUES OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND TOTAL RETURN SWAPS ARE DETERMINED USING THE MARKET STANDARD METHODOLOGY OF NETTING THE DISCOUNTED FUTURE FIXED CASH RECEIPTS (OR PAYMENTS) AND THE DISCOUNTED EXPECTED VARIABLE CASH PAYMENTS (OR RECEIPTS). THE VARIABLE CASH PAYMENTS (OR RECEIPTS) ARE BASED ON AN EXPECTATION OF FUTURE INTEREST RATES (FORWARD CURVES) DERIVED FROM OBSERVABLE MARKET INTEREST RATE CURVES. THE COMPANY INCORPORATES CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO APPROPRIATELY REFLECT BOTH ITS OWN NONPERFORMANCE RISK AND THE RESPECTIVE COUNTERPARTY\u2019S NONPERFORMANCE RISK IN THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.  ALTERNATIVE CAPITAL SOURCES  THE COMPANY UTILIZES CO-INVESTMENTS AS AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF CAPITAL FOR ACQUISITIONS OF BOTH OPERATING AND DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITIES. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD AN INTEREST IN 806 APARTMENT HOMES IN COMMUNITIES ACTIVELY UNDER  44  DEVELOPMENT WITH JOINT VENTURES FOR TOTAL ESTIMATED COSTS OF $0.6 BILLION. TOTAL ESTIMATED REMAINING COSTS TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $0.1 BILLION, OF WHICH THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS REMAINING INVESTMENT IN THESE DEVELOPMENT JOINT VENTURES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $0.1 BILLION. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAD AN INTEREST IN 10,301 APARTMENT HOMES OF OPERATING COMMUNITIES WITH JOINT VENTURES FOR A TOTAL BOOK VALUE OF $0.8 BILLION AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS UNCONSOLIDATED INTERESTS IN CERTAIN JOINT VENTURES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE UNCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS HAVE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT IMPACT ON ITS LIQUIDITY, CASH FLOWS, CAPITAL RESOURCES, CREDIT OR MARKET RISK THAN ITS CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS. SEE NOTE 4, CO-INVESTMENTS, IN THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR CARRYING VALUES AND COMBINED SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THESE UNCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY DEFINES CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS THOSE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REQUIRE THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT TO EXERCISE THEIR MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS. THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES RELATE PRINCIPALLY TO THE FOLLOWING KEY AREAS: (I) ACCOUNTING FOR THE ACQUISITION OF INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE; AND (II) ASSESSING AND MEASURING THE IMPAIRMENT OF THE COMPANY'S REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES AND INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO JOINT VENTURES AND AFFILIATES. THE COMPANY BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES HAVE NOT CHANGED MATERIALLY FROM THE INFORMATION REPORTED IN NOTE 2, SUMMARY OF CRITICAL AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  CERTAIN STATEMENTS IN THIS \"MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\" AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q WHICH ARE NOT HISTORICAL FACTS MAY BE CONSIDERED FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE \"SECURITIES ACT\"), AND SECTION 21E OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, INCLUDING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANY'S EXPECTATIONS, ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS, HOPES, INTENTIONS, BELIEFS AND STRATEGIES REGARDING THE FUTURE.

WHILE THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING ITS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE REASONABLE, SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE ACTUAL RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE COMPANY TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY FUTURE RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY CANNOT ASSURE THE FUTURE RESULTS OR OUTCOME OF THE MATTERS DESCRIBED IN THESE STATEMENTS; RATHER, THESE STATEMENTS MERELY REFLECT THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OF THE APPROXIMATE OUTCOMES OF THE MATTERS DISCUSSED. FACTORS THAT MIGHT CAUSE THE COMPANY\u2019S ACTUAL RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING: THE COMPANY MAY FAIL TO ACHIEVE ITS BUSINESS OBJECTIVES; THE ACTUAL COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO DELAYS; THE STABILIZATION DATES OF SUCH PROJECTS MAY BE DELAYED; THE COMPANY MAY ABANDON OR DEFER DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS WHICH MAKE DEVELOPMENT LESS DESIRABLE, INCREASES IN COSTS OF  45  DEVELOPMENT, INCREASES IN THE COST OF CAPITAL OR LACK OF CAPITAL AVAILABILITY, RESULTING IN LOSSES; THE TOTAL PROJECTED COSTS OF CURRENT DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MAY EXCEED EXPECTATIONS; SUCH DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MAY NOT BE COMPLETED; DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND ACQUISITIONS MAY FAIL TO MEET EXPECTATIONS; ESTIMATES OF FUTURE INCOME FROM AN ACQUIRED PROPERTY MAY PROVE TO BE INACCURATE; OCCUPANCY RATES AND RENTAL DEMAND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY COMPETITION AND LOCAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS; THERE MAY BE INCREASED INTEREST RATES AND OPERATING COSTS; THE COMPANY MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS CO-INVESTMENT PARTNERS; FUTURE CASH FLOWS MAY BE INADEQUATE TO MEET OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE FOR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH REIT REQUIREMENTS; THERE MAY BE A DOWNTURN IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY, AND THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S COMMUNITIES ARE LOCATED; CHANGES IN LAWS OR REGULATIONS; THE TERMS OF ANY REFINANCING MAY NOT BE AS FAVORABLE AS THE TERMS OF EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS; UNEXPECTED DIFFICULTIES IN LEASING OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS; VOLATILITY IN FINANCIAL AND SECURITIES MARKETS; THE COMPANY\u2019S FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE ACQUIRED PROPERTIES; UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES FROM CYBER-INTRUSION; THE COMPANY\u2019S INABILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING WITH THE RATING AGENCIES; GOVERNMENT APPROVALS, ACTIONS AND INITIATIVES, INCLUDING THE NEED FOR COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS; AND THOSE FURTHER RISKS, SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS REFERRED TO IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, IN THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, AND IN THE COMPANY'S OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \"SEC\"). ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE MADE AS OF THE DATE HEREOF, THE COMPANY ASSUMES NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR SUPPLEMENT THIS INFORMATION FOR ANY REASON, AND THEREFORE, THEY MAY NOT REPRESENT THE COMPANY\u2019S ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFTER THE DATE OF THIS REPORT.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND UNITHOLDERS  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND UNITHOLDERS (\"FFO\") IS A FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT IS COMMONLY USED IN THE REIT INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY PRESENTS FFO AND FFO EXCLUDING NON-CORE ITEMS (REFERRED TO AS \"CORE FFO\") AS SUPPLEMENTAL OPERATING PERFORMANCE MEASURES. FFO AND CORE FFO ARE NOT USED BY THE COMPANY AS, NOR SHOULD THEY BE CONSIDERED TO BE, ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME COMPUTED UNDER U.S. GAAP AS AN INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING PERFORMANCE OR AS ALTERNATIVES TO CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES COMPUTED UNDER U.S. GAAP AS AN INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO FUND ITS CASH NEEDS.  FFO AND CORE FFO ARE NOT MEANT TO REPRESENT A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND DO NOT PRESENT, NOR DO THEY INTEND TO PRESENT, A COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET INCOME COMPUTED UNDER U.S. GAAP IS THE PRIMARY MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE AND THAT FFO AND CORE FFO ARE ONLY MEANINGFUL WHEN THEY ARE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH NET INCOME.  THE COMPANY CONSIDERS FFO AND CORE FFO TO BE USEFUL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS OF AN EQUITY REIT BECAUSE, TOGETHER WITH NET INCOME AND CASH FLOWS, FFO AND CORE FFO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH ADDITIONAL BASES TO EVALUATE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND ABILITY OF A REIT TO INCUR AND SERVICE DEBT AND TO FUND ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS. BY EXCLUDING GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO SALES OF DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES AND EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION (WHICH CAN VARY AMONG OWNERS OF IDENTICAL ASSETS IN SIMILAR CONDITION BASED ON HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING AND USEFUL LIFE ESTIMATES), FFO CAN HELP INVESTORS COMPARE THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF A REAL ESTATE COMPANY BETWEEN PERIODS OR AS COMPARED TO DIFFERENT COMPANIES. BY FURTHER ADJUSTING FOR ITEMS THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED PART OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CORE BUSINESS OPERATIONS, CORE FFO ALLOWS INVESTORS TO COMPARE THE CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY TO ITS PERFORMANCE IN PRIOR REPORTING PERIODS AND TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OTHER REAL ESTATE COMPANIES WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF ITEMS THAT BY THEIR NATURE ARE NOT COMPARABLE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND TEND TO OBSCURE THE COMPANY\u2019S ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, PROVIDE THE MOST MEANINGFUL PICTURE OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  IN CALCULATING FFO, THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE DEFINITION FOR THIS MEASURE PUBLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\"NAREIT\"), WHICH IS THE LEADING REIT INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT, UNDER THE NAREIT FFO DEFINITION, THE TWO MOST SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO NET INCOME ARE (I) THE EXCLUSION OF HISTORICAL COST DEPRECIATION AND (II) THE EXCLUSION OF GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE SALE OF PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED PROPERTIES. THE COMPANY AGREES THAT THESE TWO NAREIT ADJUSTMENTS ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.  (A)  HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP ASSUMES, THROUGH DEPRECIATION CHARGES, THAT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS DIMINISHES PREDICTABLY OVER TIME. NAREIT STATED IN ITS WHITE PAPER ON FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS \"SINCE REAL ESTATE ASSET VALUES HAVE HISTORICALLY RISEN OR FALLEN WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, MANY INDUSTRY INVESTORS HAVE CONSIDERED PRESENTATIONS OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR REAL ESTATE COMPANIES THAT USE HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING TO BE INSUFFICIENT BY THEMSELVES.\" CONSEQUENTLY, NAREIT\u2019S DEFINITION OF FFO REFLECTS THE FACT THAT REAL ESTATE, AS AN ASSET CLASS, GENERALLY APPRECIATES OVER TIME AND DEPRECIATION CHARGES REQUIRED BY U.S. GAAP DO NOT REFLECT THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC REALITIES.  46  (B)  REITS WERE CREATED AS A LEGAL FORM OF ORGANIZATION IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF REAL ESTATE AS AN ASSET CLASS THROUGH INVESTMENT IN FIRMS THAT WERE IN THE BUSINESS OF LONG-TERM OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT OF REAL ESTATE.  THE EXCLUSION, IN NAREIT\u2019S DEFINITION OF FFO, OF GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE SALES OF PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING REAL ESTATE ASSETS ALLOWS INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO READILY IDENTIFY THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE LONG-TERM ASSETS THAT FORM THE CORE OF A REIT\u2019S ACTIVITY AND ASSISTS IN COMPARING THOSE OPERATING RESULTS BETWEEN PERIODS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT HAS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED THE NAREIT DEFINITION OF FFO TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. HOWEVER, THERE IS JUDGMENT INVOLVED AND OTHER REITS\u2019 CALCULATION OF FFO MAY VARY FROM THE NAREIT DEFINITION FOR THIS MEASURE, AND THUS THEIR DISCLOSURE OF FFO MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CALCULATION.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE IS A RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS TO FFO AND CORE FFO FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS).

HOWEVER, BECAUSE CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S INTEREST RATE SWAPS DO NOT HAVE A 0% LIBOR FLOOR, WHILE RELATED HEDGED DEBT IN THESE CASES IS SUBJECT TO A 0% LIBOR FLOOR, THE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THIS MISMATCH, IF ANY, IS RECORDED AS A NON-CASH INTEREST RATE HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS THROUGH INTEREST EXPENSE. ON JANUARY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY ADOPTED  47  ASU NO. 2017-12 \"DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING - TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS TO ACCOUNTING FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES,\" WHICH RESULTED IN A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $181,000 FROM INTEREST EXPENSE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  (2) ASSUMES CONVERSION OF ALL OUTSTANDING OPERATING PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP INTO SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AND EXCLUDES ALL DOWNREIT LIMITED PARTNERSHIP UNITS FOR WHICH THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS THE ABILITY AND INTENTION TO REDEEM THE UNITS FOR CASH AND DOES NOT CONSIDER THEM TO BE COMMON STOCK EQUIVALENTS.  NET OPERATING INCOME  NET OPERATING INCOME (\"NOI\") AND SAME-PROPERTY NOI ARE CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE AN IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENTAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE TO EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE PRESENTATION OF SAME-PROPERTY NOI ASSISTS WITH THE PRESENTATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS PRIOR TO THE ALLOCATION OF DEPRECIATION AND ANY CORPORATE-LEVEL OR FINANCING-RELATED COSTS. NOI REFLECTS THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF A COMMUNITY AND ALLOWS FOR AN EASY COMPARISON OF THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES OR GROUPS OF COMMUNITIES. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE PROSPECTIVE BUYERS OF REAL ESTATE HAVE DIFFERENT FINANCING AND OVERHEAD STRUCTURES, WITH VARYING MARGINAL IMPACTS TO OVERHEAD BY ACQUIRING REAL ESTATE, NOI IS CONSIDERED BY MANY IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY TO BE A USEFUL MEASURE FOR DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A REAL ESTATE ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS. THE COMPANY DEFINES SAME-PROPERTY NOI AS SAME-PROPERTY REVENUES LESS SAME-PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, INCLUDING PROPERTY TAXES.

EXECUTIVE  OVERVIEW  KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION, A MARYLAND CORPORATION, IS ONE OF NORTH AMERICA\u2019S LARGEST PUBLICLY TRADED OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF OPEN-AIR SHOPPING CENTERS.   THE TERMS \u201cKIMCO,\u201d THE \u201cCOMPANY,\u201d \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cOUR\u201d AND \u201cUS\u201d EACH REFER TO KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES, UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE.  THE COMPANY\u2019S MISSION IS TO CREATE DESTINATIONS FOR EVERYDAY LIVING THAT INSPIRE A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND DELIVER VALUE TO OUR MANY STAKEHOLDERS.  THE COMPANY IS A SELF-ADMINISTERED REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (\u201cREIT\u201d) AND HAS OWNED AND OPERATED OPEN-AIR SHOPPING CENTERS FOR OVER 60 YEARS.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENGAGED, NOR DOES IT EXPECT TO RETAIN, ANY REIT ADVISORS IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPERATION OF ITS PROPERTIES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD INTERESTS IN 428 SHOPPING CENTER PROPERTIES (THE \u201cCOMBINED SHOPPING CENTER PORTFOLIO\u201d), AGGREGATING 74.6 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF GROSS LEASABLE AREA (\u201cGLA\u201d), LOCATED IN 27 STATES AND PUERTO RICO. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAD 251 OTHER PROPERTY INTERESTS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE COMPANY\u2019S PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS, TOTALING 4.3 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF GLA. THE COMPANY\u2019S OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN REAL ESTATE CONSIST OF ITS CONSOLIDATED PORTFOLIO AND PORTFOLIOS WHERE THE COMPANY OWNS AN ECONOMIC INTEREST, SUCH AS PROPERTIES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, WHERE THE COMPANY PARTNERS WITH INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND ALSO RETAINS MANAGEMENT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING STRATEGIES ARE TO (I) OWN AND OPERATE ITS SHOPPING CENTER PROPERTIES AT THEIR HIGHEST POTENTIAL THROUGH MAXIMIZING AND MAINTAINING RENTAL INCOME AND OCCUPANCY LEVELS, (II) ATTRACT LOCAL AREA CUSTOMERS TO ITS SHOPPING CENTERS, WHICH OFFER OFF-PRICE MERCHANDISE AND DAY-TO-DAY NECESSITIES RATHER THAN HIGH-PRICED LUXURY ITEMS, AND (III) MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET.  THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS TO INVEST CAPITAL INTO HIGH QUALITY ASSETS FOCUSING ON MAJOR METROPOLITAN-AREA U.S. MARKETS, PREDOMINANTLY ON THE EAST AND WEST COASTS AND IN THE SUNBELT REGION, WHICH ARE SUPPORTED BY STRONG DEMOGRAPHICS, SIGNIFICANT PROJECTED POPULATION GROWTH, AND WHERE THE COMPANY PERCEIVES SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO ENTRY WHILE DISPOSING OF LESSER QUALITY ASSETS IN LESS DESIRABLE LOCATIONS. THROUGH THIS STRATEGY, THE COMPANY HAS STEADILY PROGRESSED IN ITS TRANSFORMATION OF ITS PORTFOLIO AND WILL CONTINUE THESE EFFORTS AS DEEMED NECESSARY TO MAXIMIZE THE QUALITY AND GROWTH OF ITS PORTFOLIO. THE PROPERTIES ACQUIRED ARE PRIMARILY LOCATED IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS ALLOWING TENANTS TO GENERATE HIGHER FOOT TRAFFIC RESULTING IN HIGHER SALES VOLUME. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THIS WILL ENABLE IT TO MAINTAIN HIGHER OCCUPANCY LEVELS, RENTAL RATES AND RENTAL GROWTH. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY, ON A SELECTIVE BASIS, HAS EMBARKED ON SEVERAL GROUND-UP DEVELOPMENT AND RE-DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WHICH INCLUDE RESIDENTIAL AND MIXED-USE COMPONENTS.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT STRATEGY ALSO INCLUDES THE RETAIL RE-TENANTING, RENOVATION AND EXPANSION OF ITS EXISTING CENTERS AND ACQUIRED CENTERS, WHILE ALSO PURSUING REDEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE OVERALL VALUE WITHIN ITS PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANY MAY SELECTIVELY ACQUIRE ESTABLISHED INCOME-PRODUCING REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES AND PROPERTIES REQUIRING SIGNIFICANT RE-TENANTING AND REDEVELOPMENT, PRIMARILY IN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY PRESENTLY OPERATES. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY MAY SELECTIVELY ACQUIRE LAND PARCELS IN ITS KEY MARKETS FOR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS FOR LONG-TERM INVESTMENT. THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER INVESTMENTS IN OTHER REAL ESTATE SECTORS AND IN GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS WHERE IT DOES NOT PRESENTLY OPERATE SHOULD SUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES ARISE. THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUES TO SIMPLIFY ITS BUSINESS BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS.  AS PART OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT STRATEGY EACH PROPERTY IS EVALUATED FOR ITS HIGHEST AND BEST USE, WHICH MAY INCLUDE RESIDENTIAL AND MIXED-USE COMPONENTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER OTHER OPPORTUNISTIC INVESTMENTS RELATED TO RETAILER CONTROLLED REAL ESTATE SUCH AS, REPOSITIONING UNDERPERFORMING RETAIL LOCATIONS, RETAIL REAL ESTATE FINANCING AND BANKRUPTCY TRANSACTION SUPPORT. THE COMPANY HAS AN ACTIVE CAPITAL RECYCLING PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN PROPERTIES. IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE FOR ANY OF THESE ASSETS IS LESS THAN THEIR NET CARRYING VALUES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND SUCH AMOUNTS COULD BE MATERIAL.

FOR SO LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE DEEMED A WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER, THIS SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ALLOWS US TO ISSUE AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME. WE SOLD NO SECURITIES UNDER THIS SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 OR 2018.  CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES  IN MAY 2017, WE ISSUED $517.5 MILLION OF 2.25% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE MAY 15, 2024.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THERE WERE NO CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  INTEREST RATE RISK  WE ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK ON OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF OUR INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES IS TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAXIMIZING YIELDS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING RISK. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, WE INVEST IN HIGHLY LIQUID AND HIGH-QUALITY GOVERNMENT AND OTHER DEBT SECURITIES. TO MINIMIZE OUR EXPOSURE DUE TO ADVERSE SHIFTS IN INTEREST RATES, WE INVEST IN SHORT-TERM SECURITIES AND ENSURE THAT THE MAXIMUM AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS DOES NOT EXCEED 12 MONTHS. IF A 10% CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES WERE TO HAVE OCCURRED ON JUNE 30, 2019, IT WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF THAT DATE. DUE TO THE SHORT HOLDING PERIOD OF OUR INVESTMENTS, WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A MATERIAL FINANCIAL MARKET RISK EXPOSURE.

THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED GAAP MEASURES, AND OTHER COMPANIES MAY DEFINE SUCH MEASURES DIFFERENTLY. WE ENCOURAGE INVESTORS TO REVIEW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RECONCILIATION OF THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THEIR ENTIRETY AND NOT TO RELY ON ANY SINGLE FINANCIAL MEASURE. THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN EXPENSES THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR CORE OPERATING RESULTS.  ADJUSTED EBITDA  OUR MANAGEMENT USES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO ASSESS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME OF HUNTSMAN CORPORATION OR HUNTSMAN INTERNATIONAL, AS APPROPRIATE, BEFORE INTEREST, INCOME TAX, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND CERTAIN CORPORATE AND OTHER ITEMS, AS WELL AS ELIMINATING THE FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENTS: (A) BUSINESS ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES; (B) PURCHASE ACCOUNTING INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS; (C) MERGER COSTS; (D) EBITDA FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS; (E) NONCONTROLLING INTEREST OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS; (F) FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS TO VENATOR INVESTMENT; (G) LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; (H) CERTAIN LEGAL SETTLEMENTS AND RELATED EXPENSES (INCOME); (I) GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESSES/ASSETS; (J) AMORTIZATION OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT ACTUARIAL LOSSES; (K) PLANT INCIDENT REMEDIATION COSTS; (L) U.S. TAX REFORM ACT IMPACT ON NONCONTROLLING INTEREST; AND (M) RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND PLANT CLOSING AND TRANSITION COSTS (CREDITS). WE BELIEVE THAT NET INCOME OF HUNTSMAN CORPORATION OR HUNTSMAN INTERNATIONAL, AS APPROPRIATE, IS THE PERFORMANCE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP THAT IS MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO ADJUSTED EBITDA.  WE BELIEVE ADJUSTED EBITDA IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN ASSESSING THE BUSINESSES\u2019 ONGOING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROVIDES IMPROVED COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS THROUGH THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN ITEMS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF THE BUSINESSES\u2019 OPERATIONAL PROFITABILITY AND THAT MAY OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS RESULTS AND TRENDS. HOWEVER, THIS MEASURE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OF HUNTSMAN CORPORATION OR HUNTSMAN INTERNATIONAL, AS APPROPRIATE, OR OTHER MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. MOREOVER, ADJUSTED EBITDA AS USED HEREIN IS NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES DUE TO POTENTIAL INCONSISTENCIES IN THE METHODS OF CALCULATION. OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS USEFUL TO COMPARE GENERAL OPERATING PERFORMANCE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND TO MAKE CERTAIN RELATED MANAGEMENT DECISIONS. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS ALSO USED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS, LENDERS AND OTHERS IN THEIR EVALUATION OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES CERTAIN ITEMS THAT CAN VARY WIDELY ACROSS DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES OR AMONG COMPANIES WITHIN THE SAME INDUSTRY. FOR EXAMPLE, INTEREST EXPENSE CAN BE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON A COMPANY\u2019S CAPITAL STRUCTURE, DEBT LEVELS AND CREDIT RATINGS. THEREFORE, THE IMPACT OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON EARNINGS CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, THE TAX POSITIONS OF COMPANIES CAN VARY BECAUSE OF THEIR DIFFERING ABILITIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TAX BENEFITS AND BECAUSE OF THE TAX POLICIES OF THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. AS A RESULT, EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND TAX EXPENSE CAN VARY CONSIDERABLY AMONG COMPANIES. FINALLY, COMPANIES EMPLOY PRODUCTIVE ASSETS OF DIFFERENT AGES AND UTILIZE DIFFERENT METHODS OF ACQUIRING AND DEPRECIATING SUCH ASSETS. THIS CAN RESULT IN CONSIDERABLE VARIABILITY IN THE RELATIVE COSTS OF PRODUCTIVE ASSETS AND THE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AMONG COMPANIES.  NEVERTHELESS, OUR MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT THERE ARE MATERIAL LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF ADJUSTED EBITDA IN THE EVALUATION OF OUR COMPANY AS COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF HUNTSMAN CORPORATION OR HUNTSMAN INTERNATIONAL, AS APPROPRIATE, WHICH REFLECTS OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE BORROWED MONEY IN ORDER TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS AND INTEREST EXPENSE IS A NECESSARY ELEMENT OF OUR COSTS AND ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE. OUR MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THE LIMITATIONS OF USING ADJUSTED EBITDA BY USING THIS MEASURE TO SUPPLEMENT U.S. GAAP RESULTS TO PROVIDE A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS AND TRENDS AFFECTING THE BUSINESS RATHER THAN U.S. GAAP RESULTS ALONE.  \u200b  ADJUSTED NET INCOME  ADJUSTED NET INCOME IS COMPUTED BY ELIMINATING THE AFTER TAX AMOUNTS RELATED TO THE FOLLOWING FROM NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO HUNTSMAN CORPORATION OR HUNTSMAN INTERNATIONAL, AS APPROPRIATE: (A) BUSINESS ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES; (B) PURCHASE ACCOUNTING INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS; (C) MERGER COSTS; (D) LOSS (INCOME) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS; (E) NONCONTROLLING INTEREST OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS; (F) FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS TO VENATOR INVESTMENT; (G) LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; (H) CERTAIN LEGAL SETTLEMENTS AND RELATED (INCOME) EXPENSES; (I) GAIN ON SALE OF ASSETS; (J) AMORTIZATION OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT ACTUARIAL LOSSES; (K) PLANT INCIDENT REMEDIATION COSTS; (L) RELEASE OR ESTABLISHMENT OF SIGNIFICANT INCOME TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES; (M) U.S. TAX REFORM ACT IMPACT ON INCOME TAX EXPENSE;  51  TABLE OF CONTENTS  (N) U.S. TAX REFORM ACT IMPACT ON NONCONTROLLING INTEREST; (O) IMPACT OF SWITZERLAND INCOME TAX RATE CHANGE; AND (P) RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND PLANT CLOSING AND TRANSITION COSTS (CREDITS). BASIC ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER SHARE EXCLUDES DILUTION AND IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING ADJUSTED NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. ADJUSTED DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE REFLECTS ALL POTENTIAL DILUTIVE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD AND IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING ADJUSTED NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD INCREASED BY THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING AS DILUTIVE SECURITIES. ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER SHARE AMOUNTS ARE PRESENTED SOLELY AS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, NET OF REIMBURSEMENTS  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, NET OF REIMBURSEMENTS, REPRESENT CASH PAID FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES LESS PAYMENTS RECEIVED AS REIMBURSEMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS.  FREE CASH FLOW  MANAGEMENT INTERNALLY USES A FREE CASH FLOW MEASURE: (A) TO EVALUATE OUR LIQUIDITY, (B) EVALUATE STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS, (C) PLAN STOCK BUYBACK AND DIVIDEND LEVELS, AND (D) EVALUATE OUR ABILITY TO INCUR AND SERVICE DEBT. FREE CASH FLOW IS NOT A DEFINED TERM UNDER U.S. GAAP, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE INFERRED THAT THE ENTIRE FREE CASH FLOW AMOUNT IS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES. THE COMPANY DEFINES FREE CASH FLOW AS CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING ACQUISITION/DISPOSITION ACTIVITIES AND INCLUDING NON-RECURRING SEPARATION COSTS. FREE CASH FLOW IS TYPICALLY DERIVED DIRECTLY FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS; HOWEVER, IT MAY BE ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS THAT AFFECT COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS.  ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  WE BELIEVE THAT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF HUNTSMAN CORPORATION OR HUNTSMAN INTERNATIONAL, AS APPROPRIATE, IS THE PERFORMANCE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP THAT IS MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. WE BELIEVE OUR ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE PROVIDES IMPROVED COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS THROUGH THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN ITEMS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF THE BUSINESSES\u2019 OPERATIONAL PROFITABILITY AND THAT MAY OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS RESULTS AND TRENDS. WE DO NOT PROVIDE RECONCILIATIONS FOR ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON A FORWARD-LOOKING BASIS BECAUSE WE ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL OR ACCURATE CALCULATION OR ESTIMATION OF RECONCILING ITEMS AND THE INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE WITHOUT UNREASONABLE EFFORT. THIS IS DUE TO THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY OF FORECASTING THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CERTAIN ITEMS, SUCH AS BUSINESS ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES, MERGER COSTS, CERTAIN LEGAL AND OTHER SETTLEMENTS AND RELATED COSTS, GAINS ON SALE OF BUSINESS/ASSETS, AND AMORTIZATION OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT ACTUARIAL LOSSES.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  BASIS OF PRESENTATION.  THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY OR AMD) HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (U.S. GAAP) FOR INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND THE INSTRUCTIONS TO FORM 10-Q AND ARTICLE 10 OF REGULATION S-X. THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 29, 2019  SHOWN IN THIS REPORT ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR THE FULL YEAR ENDING  DECEMBER 28, 2019  . IN THE OPINION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT, THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN REFLECTS ALL ADJUSTMENTS NECESSARY FOR A FAIR PRESENTATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOWS AND S  TOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  . ALL SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE OF A NORMAL, RECURRING NATURE. THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018.  CERTAIN PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTATION.  THE COMPANY USES A 52 OR 53 WEEK FISCAL YEAR ENDING ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN DECEMBER. THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 29, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2018  EACH CONSISTED OF 13 WEEKS AND 26 WEEKS, RESPECTIVELY.  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION.  THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE COMPANY\u2019S ACCOUNTS AND THOSE OF ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. UPON CONSOLIDATION, ALL SIGNIFICANT INTER-COMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  EXCEPT FOR THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES HIGHLIGHTED BELOW, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018.  LEASES.  THE COMPANY DETERMINES IF AN ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE, OR CONTAINS A LEASE, AT THE INCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT. WHEN THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE, OR CONTAINS A LEASE, AT LEASE INCEPTION, IT THEN DETERMINES WHETHER THE LEASE IS AN OPERATING LEASE OR A FINANCE LEASE AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE. OPERATING AND FINANCE LEASES RESULT IN THE COMPANY RECORDING A RIGHT-OF-USE (ROU) ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY ON ITS BALANCE SHEET. ROU ASSETS REPRESENT THE COMPANY'S RIGHT TO USE AN UNDERLYING ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM AND LEASE LIABILITIES REPRESENT ITS OBLIGATION TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS ARISING FROM THE LEASE. OPERATING AND FINANCE LEASE ROU ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE LEASE COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY USES THE IMPLICIT INTEREST RATE IF READILY DETERMINABLE. WHEN THE IMPLICIT RATE IS NOT READILY DETERMINABLE, THE COMPANY USES ITS INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE LEASE COMMENCEMENT DATE IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS. THE OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSET IS RECOGNIZED NET OF ANY LEASE PAYMENTS MADE AND ANY LEASE INCENTIVES. SPECIFIC LEASE TERMS MAY INCLUDE OPTIONS TO EXTEND OR TERMINATE THE LEASE WHEN THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT IT WILL EXERCISE THAT OPTION. LEASE EXPENSE FOR LEASE PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. AS ALLOWED BY THE GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED NOT TO RECOGNIZE ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES THAT ARISE FROM SHORT-TERM (12 MONTHS OR LESS) LEASES FOR ANY CLASS OF UNDERLYING ASSET. OPERATING LEASES ARE INCLUDED IN OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS, OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES, AND LONG-TERM OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES IN THE COMPANY'S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY'S FINANCE LEASES ARE IMMATERIAL.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING STRATEGY WHICH USES DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THIS STRATEGY TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED EXPOSURES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING OR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.  IN APPLYING ITS STRATEGY, THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE CERTAIN FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY DESIGNATES THESE CONTRACTS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FORECASTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES, TO THE EXTENT ELIGIBLE UNDER THE ACCOUNTING RULES, AND EVALUATES HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS PROSPECTIVELY AND RETROSPECTIVELY. TO THE EXTENT SUCH HEDGES ARE EFFECTIVE, THE COMPANY RECORDS THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THESE CONTRACTS AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) AND IT RECLASSIFIES SUCH GAINS OR LOSSES TO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. SUCH AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE SAME LINE ITEM IN EARNINGS AS THE ASSOCIATED FORECASTED TRANSACTION.  THE COMPANY ALSO USES, FROM TIME TO TIME, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE RECOGNIZED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ON THE BALANCE SHEETS OF VARIOUS SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT DESIGNATE THESE FORWARD CONTRACTS AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE GAIN OR LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CONTRACTS IS IMMEDIATELY RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET.  9  RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-13,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820)  , WHICH AMENDS DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. ASU 2018-13 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. THE COMPANY EARLY ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WITH NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  LEASES.  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  , TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY AMONG ORGANIZATIONS FOR LEASE RECOGNITION AND DISCLOSURE. ASU 2016-02 REQUIRES LESSEES TO RECOGNIZE LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET, WHILE RECOGNIZING EXPENSES ON THE INCOME STATEMENTS IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO LEGACY GUIDANCE. ASU 2016-02 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE NEW STANDARD USING THE OPTIONAL ADOPTION METHOD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WHEREBY THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE TO ADJUST COMPARATIVE PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE NEW STANDARD AND RECORDED  $228  MILLION  OF RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND  $261  MILLION  OF LEASE LIABILITIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO OFFICE BUILDINGS IN ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2018. THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING FOR CAPITAL LEASES, NOW REFERRED TO AS FINANCE LEASES, REMAINS UNCHANGED. THE COMPANY'S ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD HAD NO IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS OR ON NET CASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN OPERATING, FINANCING, OR INVESTING ACTIVITIES ON ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.  UPON ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-02, THE COMPANY ELECTED A TRANSITION PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT UNDER THE NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD ALLOWING IT NOT TO SEPARATE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS AND INSTEAD TO ACCOUNT FOR EACH SEPARATE LEASE COMPONENT AND NON-LEASE COMPONENT AS A SINGLE LEASE COMPONENT. THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED INTERNAL CONTROLS AND KEY SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY TO ENABLE THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON ADOPTION.  REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-02,  INCOME STATEMENT  \u2014  REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220).  RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  , WHICH ALLOWS COMPANIES TO RECLASSIFY CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE 2017 TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (TAX ACT), FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO RETAINED EARNINGS. ASU 2018-02 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WITH NO IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING.  IN AUGUST 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-12,  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING (TOPIC 815): TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS TO ACCOUNTING FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES  , WHICH AMENDS AND SIMPLIFIES EXISTING GUIDANCE TO ALLOW COMPANIES TO MORE ACCURATELY PRESENT THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ASU 2017-12 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WITH NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-13,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS-CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326), MEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  . THIS STANDARD CHANGES THE METHODOLOGY FOR MEASURING CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND THE TIMING OF WHEN SUCH LOSSES ARE RECORDED. ASU 2016-13 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, USING A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE ADOPTION METHOD. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT THIS STANDARD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE STANDARD. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THE STANDARD ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN MAY 2019, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2019-05,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS-CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326)  ,  TARGETED TRANSITION RELIEF,  WHICH PROVIDES ENTITIES THAT HAVE CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ASC 326-20,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS-CREDIT LOSSES-MEASURED AT AMORTIZED COST,  WITH AN OPTION TO IRREVOCABLY ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR ELIGIBLE INSTRUMENTS. THE EFFECTIVE DATE AND TRANSITION METHODOLOGY FOR THIS STANDARD ARE THE SAME AS IN ASU 2016-13.  THERE WERE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT UPDATES TO THE RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS OTHER THAN AS DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018.  ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED OR PROPOSED BY THE FASB, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THESE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS HAD OR WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  10  NOTE 2.  GLOBALFOUNDRIES  IN MARCH 2009, THE COMPANY AND GLOBALFOUNDRIES INC. (GF) ENTERED INTO A WAFER SUPPLY AGREEMENT (THE WSA) UNDER WHICH, AMONG OTHER TERMS, THE COMPANY WOULD PURCHASE WAFERS FROM GF. THE WSA, WHICH HAS BEEN AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, GOVERNS THE TERMS BY WHICH THE COMPANY PURCHASES PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY GF. ON JANUARY 28, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SEVENTH AMENDMENT (THE SEVENTH AMENDMENT) TO THE WSA WITH GF, WHICH MODIFIES CERTAIN PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, PRICING AND OTHER TERMS OF THE WSA APPLICABLE TO WAFER PURCHASES AT THE 12 NM TECHNOLOGY NODE AND ABOVE BY THE COMPANY FOR THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON JANUARY 1, 2019 AND CONTINUING THROUGH MARCH 1, 2024. THE SEVENTH AMENDMENT ALSO PROVIDES THE COMPANY WITH FULL FLEXIBILITY TO CONTRACT WITH ANY WAFER FOUNDRY WITH RESPECT TO ALL PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED USING 7NM AND SMALLER TECHNOLOGY NODES WITHOUT ANY ONE-TIME PAYMENTS OR ROYALTIES BY THE COMPANY TO GF. FURTHER, THE COMPANY AND GF AGREED TO MODIFY THE ANNUAL WAFER PURCHASE TARGETS PREVIOUSLY AGREED TO FOR YEARS 2019 AND 2020. THE PARTIES ALSO AGREED TO AN ANNUAL WAFER PURCHASE TARGET FOR 2021 AND AGREED TO PRICING FOR WAFERS PURCHASED FOR YEARS 2019 THROUGH 2021. IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT MEET THE ANNUAL WAFER PURCHASE TARGET FOR ANY OF THESE YEARS, THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY TO GF A PORTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMPANY\u2019S ACTUAL WAFER PURCHASES AND THE WAFER PURCHASE TARGET FOR THAT YEAR. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT ITS FUTURE PURCHASES FROM GF WILL BE MATERIAL UNDER THE WSA, WHICH IS IN PLACE UNTIL MARCH 1, 2024. THE COMPANY ALSO AGREED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE QUARTERLY PAYMENTS TO GF BASED ON THE VOLUME OF CERTAIN WAFERS PURCHASED FROM ANOTHER WAFER FOUNDRY.  ON AUGUST 30, 2016, IN CONSIDERATION FOR THE LIMITED WAIVER AND RIGHTS UNDER THE WSA SIXTH AMENDMENT, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A WARRANT AGREEMENT (THE WARRANT AGREEMENT) WITH WEST COAST HITECH L.P. (WCH), A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF MUBADALA DEVELOPMENT COMPANY PJSC (MUBADALA).

NET REVENUE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 29, 2019  WAS  $1.53 BILLION  , A  13%  DECREASE  COMPARED TO THE  PRIOR YEAR PERIOD  . THE  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A  13%  DECREASE  IN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS NET REVENUE AND A  12%  DECREASE  IN ENTERPRISE, EMBEDDED AND SEMI-CUSTOM NET REVENUE. THE DECREASE IN COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS SEGMENT NET REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES OF OUR RADEONTM CHANNEL PRODUCTS, AND LOWER GRAPHICS CHANNEL MEMORY SALES CAUSED PRIMARILY BY THE DECLINE IN BLOCKCHAIN-RELATED DEMAND, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DEMAND FOR OUR RYZENTM PROCESSORS AND DATACENTER GPUS. THE DECREASE IN ENTERPRISE, EMBEDDED AND SEMI-CUSTOM SEGMENT NET REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SEMI-CUSTOM REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EPYCTM SERVER PROCESSOR REVENUE.  OUR OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 29, 2019  WAS  $59 MILLION  COMPARED TO OPERATING INCOME OF  $153 MILLION  FOR THE  PRIOR YEAR PERIOD  .

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IS CONTAINED IN NOTE 10: SEGMENT REPORTING OF THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PART I, FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THIS FORM 10-Q).  OUR OPERATING RESULTS TEND TO VARY SEASONALLY. HISTORICALLY, FIRST QUARTER PC PRODUCT SALES HAVE BEEN GENERALLY LOWER THAN FOURTH QUARTER SALES AND, WITH RESPECT TO OUR SEMI-CUSTOM SOC PRODUCTS FOR GAME CONSOLES OUR SALES PATTERN HAS REFLECTED HIGHER SALES IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS COMPARED TO THE FIRST AND FOURTH QUARTERS, ALTHOUGH PRODUCT TRANSITIONS COULD IMPACT THESE TRENDS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF NET REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BY SEGMENT.

UNIT SHIPMENTS WERE FLAT DUE TO AN INCREASE IN RYZEN PROCESSOR AND DATACENTER GPU SALES, OFFSET BY LOWER DEMAND FOR OUR RADEON CHANNEL PRODUCTS CAUSED PRIMARILY BY THE DECLINE IN BLOCKCHAIN-RELATED DEMAND. THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER DEMAND FOR OUR RYZEN PROCESSORS AND DATACENTER GPUS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEMAND FOR OUR RADEON CHANNEL PRODUCTS.  COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS NET REVENUE OF  $1.8 BILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 29, 2019  DECREASED  BY  20%  , COMPARED TO NET REVENUE OF  $2.2 BILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A 4% DECREASE IN UNIT SHIPMENTS AND LOWER GRAPHICS CHANNEL MEMORY SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 5% INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE. THE DECREASE IN UNIT SHIPMENTS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER DEMAND FOR OUR RADEON CHANNEL PRODUCTS CAUSED PRIMARILY BY THE DECLINE IN BLOCKCHAIN-RELATED DEMAND, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DEMAND FOR OUR RYZEN PROCESSORS. THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER DEMAND FOR OUR RYZEN PROCESSORS AND DATACENTER GPUS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEMAND FOR OUR RADEON CHANNEL PRODUCTS.  COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS OPERATING INCOME WAS  $22 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 29, 2019  , COMPARED TO OPERATING INCOME OF $117 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE  DECLINE  IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER SALES AND HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES. OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH UNDER \u201cEXPENSES\u201d BELOW.  COMPUTING AND GRAPHICS OPERATING INCOME WAS  $38 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 29, 2019  , COMPARED TO OPERATING INCOME OF  $255 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.

MANY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EMPLOYEES ARE PAID HOURLY RATES RELATED TO STATE MINIMUM WAGE LAWS  THAT ARE TIED TO INFLATION INDEXES SO THAT CHANGES IN THESE LAWS WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER LABOR COSTS TO THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, FOOD ITEMS PURCHASED BY THE COMPANY ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND PRESSURES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT MODEST INCREASES IN THESE COSTS CAN BE OFFSET THROUGH PRICE CHANGES AND OTHER COST CONTROL EFFORTS. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WOULD BE ABLE TO PASS SIGNIFICANT COSTS ON TO ITS CUSTOMERS IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  IN RECENT YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS FINANCED OPERATIONS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CASH ON HAND, CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATIONS AND LOANS FROM OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS.

THE NET WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT WAS $5.4 MILLION AND $4.4 MILLION AT MAY 20, 2019 AND JANUARY 28, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO GROW OUR BUSINESS AND ANTICIPATE RAISING SUCH CAPITAL THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK OR DEBT. WE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN BORROWING REQUIRED CAPITAL TO GROW OUR BUSINESS FROM OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS. WE HAVE NO COMMITMENT FROM THEM TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL VOLUNTARILY CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CAPITAL AS NEEDED. WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AS NEEDED, AND WE WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED TO PAY A HIGH PRICE FOR CAPITAL.  THE COMPANY GENERATES CASH FLOW DAILY FROM SALES IN ITS RESTAURANTS AND MANAGES ITS CASH BALANCES TO MEET ITS CURRENT OPERATING OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $69,000 ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE 16-WEEKS ENDING MAY 20, 2019, PRIMARILY ON EXISTING RESTAURANTS.  CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATIONS WAS APPROXIMATELY $29,000 FOR THE 16-WEEKS ENDING MAY 20, 2019 AND $514,000 FOR THE 16-WEEKS ENDING MAY 21, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE 16-WEEK PERIOD ENDING MAY 20, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE NET LOSS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $8,000 FOR THE 16-WEEKS ENDING MAY 20, 2019 COMPARED TO CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $350,000 FOR THE 16-WEEKS ENDING MAY 21, 2018.

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  THE COMPANY EVALUATES IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 360, \u201cPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\u201d.  THE COMPANY ASSESSES WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWN IS NECESSARY WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED IS MEASURED BY A COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSET.  IF SUCH ASSET IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. ANY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED AS A CHARGE TO EARNINGS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS IN THE AFFECTED PERIOD.  JUDGMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY RELATED TO THE EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO REALIZE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF SUCH ASSETS ARE AFFECTED BY FACTORS SUCH AS THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENTS OF THE ASSETS, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND CHANGES IN OPERATING PERFORMANCE. AS THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE ONGOING EXPECTED NET CASH FLOWS AND CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, THESE FACTORS COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY TO REALIZE A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD.  17  BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT  BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT ARE CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ARE PROVIDED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE FOLLOWING USEFUL LIVES.  YEARS  BUILDING  40  LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS  15  -  20  (1)  FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT  5  -  8  (1)  LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE LESSER OF THE LIFE OF THE LEASE OR THE ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE ASSETS. THE LIFE OF THE LEASE INCLUDES RENEWAL OPTIONS DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT AT LEASE INCEPTION AS REASONABLY LIKELY TO BE EXERCISED. IF A PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED LEASE OPTION IS NOT EXERCISED, ANY REMAINING UNAMORTIZED LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE EXPENSED IMMEDIATELY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO OPERATING RESULTS IN THAT PERIOD.  EQUIPMENT IN NON-OPERATING UNITS OR STORED IN WAREHOUSES, WHICH IS HELD FOR REMODELING OR REPOSITIONING, IS DEPRECIATED AND IS RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS PROPERTY, BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT HELD FOR FUTURE USE.  BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT PLACED ON THE MARKET FOR SALE IS NOT DEPRECIATED AND IS RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS PROPERTY HELD FOR SALE AND RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.  REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AS INCURRED. MAJOR EQUIPMENT REFURBISHMENTS AND REMODELING COSTS ARE GENERALLY CAPITALIZED.  THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES REGARDING BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT INCLUDE CERTAIN MANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF SUCH ASSETS, THE RESIDUAL VALUES TO WHICH THE ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED AND THE DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT CONSTITUTES THE LIFE OF EXISTING ASSETS. THESE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES MAY PRODUCE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE THAN WOULD BE REPORTED IF DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED.  INCOME TAXES  OUR CURRENT PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS BASED ON OUR ESTIMATED TAXABLE INCOME IN EACH OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, AFTER CONSIDERING THE IMPACT ON OUR TAXABLE INCOME OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULTING FROM DISPARATE TREATMENT OF ITEMS, SUCH AS DEPRECIATION, ESTIMATED LIABILITY FOR CLOSED RESTAURANTS, ESTIMATED LIABILITIES FOR SELF-INSURANCE, TAX CREDITS AND NET OPERATING LOSSES (\u201cNOL\u201d) FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED FOR THE ESTIMATED FUTURE INCOME TAX EFFECT OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE ALSO PROVIDED FOR NOL AND INCOME TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS IS ESTABLISHED WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT REALIZE SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE TAX BENEFIT OF OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS. WE EVALUATE, ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS ARE REALIZABLE BASED UPON RECENT PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, TAX REPORTING POSITIONS, AND EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. THE DETERMINATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS SUBJECT TO ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO DETERMINE IF OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES SHOULD CHANGE.  CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY HAS A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSET, NET OF EXPECTED REVERSALS OF EXISTING DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES.  ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  IN NOVEMBER 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) 2018-18 \u2013  COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS  (TOPIC 808), WHICH CLARIFIES THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TOPIC 808 AND TOPIC 606, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE PROVISIONS OF ASU 2018-18 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO ADOPT THIS STANDARD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2021. THIS STANDARD IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.  18  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES UPDATE  ADOPTION OF ASC TOPIC 842: LEASES  THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2016-02-  LEASES  (TOPIC 842) AND RELATED AMENDMENTS, AS OF JANUARY 29, 2019, USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH. THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH PROVIDES A METHOD FOR RECORDING EXISTING LEASES AT ADOPTION WITH A CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS. THE COMPANY ELECTED THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS WHICH PERMITS THE COMPANY TO NOT REASSESS (1) WHETHER ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE OR CONTAIN LEASES, (2) THE LEASE CLASSIFICATION FOR ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING LEASES, AND (3) ANY INITIAL DIRECT COSTS FOR ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING LEASES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE. THE COMPANY ALSO ELECTED THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT LEASE CONSIDERATIONS TO NOT ALLOCATE LEASE CONSIDERATIONS BETWEEN LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS FOR REAL ESTATE LEASES. AS SUCH, REAL ESTATE LEASE CONSIDERATIONS ARE TREATED AS A SINGLE LEASE-COMPONENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR ACCORDINGLY.  THE COMPANY APPLIED A PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO EFFECTIVELY ACCOUNT FOR THE OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES AND OPERATING LEASE ASSETS; THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE FINANCING LEASES. THE COMPANY EXCLUDES LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS FROM THE APPLICATION OF TOPIC 842.  ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD RESULTED IN THE RECORDING OF OPERATING LEASE ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES OF $14.4 MILLION AND $15.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF JANUARY 29, 2019. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE APPROXIMATE VALUE OF THE OPERATING LEASE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO DEFERRED RENT, DEFERRED RENT INCENTIVES, LEASEHOLD INTERESTS AND PREPAID RENT. THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN THE BEGINNING ACCUMULATED DEFICIT WAS $(501,000) DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842. THERE WAS NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS OR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS CASH FLOWS. THE COMPANY\u2019S COMPARATIVE PERIODS CONTINUE TO BE PRESENTED AND DISCLOSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH LEGACY GUIDANCE IN TOPIC 840.  OPERATING LEASES  THE COMPANY DETERMINES IF AN ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. LEASE AGREEMENTS WILL TYPICALLY EXIST WITH LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY.  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES EQUAL TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE LEASE PAYMENTS AND OPERATING LEASE ASSETS REPRESENTING THE RIGHT TO USE THE UNDERLYING ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM. THE LEASE EXPENSE FOR LEASE PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  AS THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASES DO NOT PROVIDE AN IMPLICIT RATE, THE COMPANY WILL USE A SECURED INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT LEASE COMMENCEMENT IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS. THE OPERATING LEASE ASSETS INCLUDE ANY LEASE PAYMENTS MADE PRIOR TO LEASE COMMENCEMENT AND ARE REDUCED BY ANY LEASE INCENTIVES.  UNDER TOPIC 842, FOR ANY NEW LEASES ENTERED INTO, THE COMPANY WILL ASSESS IF IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE LEASE OPTIONS TO EXTEND OR TERMINATE THE LEASE FOR INCLUSION (OR EXCLUSION) IN THE LEASE TERM WHEN THE COMPANY MEASURES THE LEASE LIABILITY. THE DEPRECIABLE LIFE OF ANY ASSETS AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS ARE LIMITED BY THE EXPECTED LEASE TERM.  CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING LEASES INCLUDE VARIABLE RENTAL PAYMENTS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF SALES OVER CONTRACTUAL LEVELS. VARIABLE RENTAL PAYMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE OBLIGATION FOR THOSE PAYMENTS IS INCURRED. IF SUCH VARIABLE OPERATING LEASES ARISE THAT INCLUDE INCENTIVES FROM LANDLORDS IN THE FORM OF CASH, THE COMPANY WILL RECORD THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE INCENTIVE WHEN SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ARE MET AS A DEFERRED LIABILITY. THE DEFERRED LIABILITY IS AMORTIZED INTO INCOME AS A REDUCTION OF RENT EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE APPLICABLE LEASE, INCLUDING OPTIONS TO EXTEND IF THEY ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO BE EXERCISED. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED THOSE LIABILITIES TO BE AMORTIZED WITHIN A YEAR AS A CURRENT LIABILITY AND THOSE GREATER THAN A YEAR AS A LONG-TERM LIABILITY. FOR PURPOSES OF RECOGNIZING THESE INCENTIVES AND RENTAL EXPENSES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, THE COMPANY USES THE DATE IT OBTAINS THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE AND CONTROL THE LEASE ASSET TO BEGIN AMORTIZATION, WHICH IS GENERALLY WHEN THE COMPANY TAKES POSSESSION OF THE ASSET. PLEASE REFER TO NOTE 5 \u2013 OPERATING LEASES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES RELATED TO LEASES.

WE REFER TO THE LAUNDRY LOCATIONS OF THE U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING REPORTING SEGMENT AS \u201cINDUSTRIAL LAUNDRIES\u201d OR \u201cINDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY LOCATIONS\u201d, AND TO THE U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING, MFG, AND CORPOR  ATE REPORTING SEGMENTS COMBINED AS OUR \u201cCORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS.\u201d  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). AS SUCH, MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DEFINED AS THOSE THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES, THE MOST IMPORTANT AND PERVASIVE ACCOUNTING POLICIES USED AND AREAS MOST SENSITIVE TO MATERIAL CHANGES FROM EXTERNAL FACTORS.

GENERAL  WE DERIVE OUR REVENUES THROUGH THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, PERSONALIZATION, RENTAL, CLEANING, DELIVERING, AND SELLING OF A WIDE RANGE OF UNIFORMS AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING, INCLUDING SHIRTS, PANTS, JACKETS, COVERALLS, LAB COATS, SMOCKS AND APRONS AND SPECIALIZED PROTECTIVE WEAR, SUCH AS FLAME RESISTANT AND HIGH VISIBILITY GARMENTS. WE ALSO RENT INDUSTRIAL WIPING PRODUCTS, FLOOR MATS, FACILITY SERVICE PRODUCTS, OTHER NON-GARMENT ITEMS, AND PROVIDE RESTROOM AND CLEANING SUPPLIES AND FIRST AID CABINET SERVICES AND OTHER SAFETY SUPPLIES, TO A VARIETY OF MANUFACTURERS, RETAILERS AND SERVICE COMPANIES. WE HAVE FIVE REPORTING SEGMENTS, U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING, MFG, SPECIALTY GARMENTS, FIRST AID AND CORPORATE. WE REFER TO THE U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING, MFG, AND CORPORATE REPORTING SEGMENTS COMBINED AS OUR \u201cCORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS.\u201d  COST OF REVENUES INCLUDE THE AMORTIZATION OF RENTAL MERCHANDISE IN SERVICE AND MERCHANDISE COSTS RELATED TO DIRECT SALES AS WELL AS LABOR AND OTHER PRODUCTION, SERVICE AND DELIVERY COSTS, AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING OUR CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS, SPECIALTY GARMENTS FACILITIES, AND FIRST AID LOCATIONS. SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCLUDE COSTS RELATED TO OUR SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CORPORATE OFFICES, NON-OPERATING ENVIRONMENTAL SITES AND OPERATING LOCATIONS INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ENGINEERING, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT, MANUFACTURING PLANNING, FINANCE, BUDGETING, AND HUMAN RESOURCES.  WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PLANTS AND CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IN ENERGY PRODUCING REGIONS IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. IN GENERAL, WE ARE RELATIVELY MORE DEPENDENT ON BUSINESS IN THESE REGIONS THAN ARE MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DRAMATIC DECREASE IN OIL PRICES BEGINNING IN 2014 DIRECTLY AFFECTED OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY AS THEY CURTAILED THEIR LEVEL OF OPERATIONS, WHICH ALSO HAD A CORRESPONDING EFFECT ON OUR CUSTOMERS IN BUSINESSES WHICH SERVICE OR SUPPLY THE OIL INDUSTRY AS WELL AS OUR CUSTOMERS IN UNRELATED BUSINESSES LOCATED IN AREAS WHICH HAD BENEFITED FROM THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION GENERATED BY THE ROBUST GROWTH DRIVEN BY THE HIGHER OIL PRICES IN PRIOR YEARS. AS A RESULT, OUR ORGANIC GROWTH IN PERIODS FOLLOWING THIS DRAMATIC DECREASE IN OIL PRICES WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ELEVATED HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS IN OUR WEARER BASE AS WELL AS INCREASED LOST ACCOUNTS. RECENT TRENDS INDICATE THAT INCREASED ENERGY PRICES HAVE RESULTED IN STABILIZED OR IMPROVED WEARER LEVELS AT EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN OUR NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY-DEPENDENT MARKETS. OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE ALSO DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE COSTS OF THE GASOLINE USED TO FUEL OUR VEHICLES AND THE NATURAL GAS USED TO OPERATE OUR PLANTS. WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN ENERGY PRICES, IN GENERAL, WE BELIEVE THAT SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES WOULD HAVE AN OVERALL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS DUE TO CUTBACKS BY OUR CUSTOMERS BOTH IN, AND DEPENDENT UPON, THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRIES, WHICH WOULD OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS IN OUR OPERATING COSTS FROM LOWER ENERGY COSTS.  27  THE COST OF HEALTHCARE THAT WE PROVIDE TO OUR EMPLOYEES HAS GROWN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AT A RATE IN EXCESS OF OUR REVENUE GROWTH AND AS A RESULT, HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR OPERATING RESULTS. MOREOVER, IT IS GENERALLY EXPECTED THAT HEALTHCARE COSTS IN  THE UNITED STATES WILL INCREASE OVER THE COMING YEARS AT RATES IN EXCESS OF INFLATION. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, AND DEPENDING ON THE EFFECT OF ANY MODIFICATIONS WE HAVE MADE, AND MAY MAKE IN THE FUTURE, TO OUR EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE PLANS AND ENROLLMENT  LEVELS IN THOSE PLANS, WE EXPECT THAT OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE FURTHER ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY INCREASING HEALTHCARE COSTS.  OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS, INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENTS, OVERTIME REQUIREMENTS, WORKING CONDITION REQUIREMENTS, CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENTS, HEALTHCARE INSURANCE MANDATES AND OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IMPACT OUR LABOR COSTS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR LABOR COSTS WILL RISE DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019 AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN STATE AND LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE LEVELS AS WELL AS THE OVERALL IMPACT OF WAGE PRESSURE AS THE RESULT OF A LOW UNEMPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT.  ON JANUARY 2, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZING US TO REPURCHASE FROM TIME TO TIME UP TO $100.0 MILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. REPURCHASES MADE UNDER THE PROGRAM, IF ANY, WILL BE MADE IN EITHER THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE TIMING, MANNER, PRICE AND AMOUNT OF ANY REPURCHASES WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR STOCK PRICE, CORPORATE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND PRIORITIES, APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL BE FUNDED USING OUR AVAILABLE CASH OR CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.  DURING THE THIRTEEN AND THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED MAY 25, 2019, WE REPURCHASED 99,500 AND 144,500 SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, FOR AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF $147.47 AND $145.01, RESPECTIVELY.  DURING FISCAL 2017, WE RECORDED A PRE-TAX NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $55.8 MILLION ONCE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED WOULD BE COMPLETED AND PLACED INTO SERVICE. ON DECEMBER 28, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR LEAD CONTRACTOR FOR THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO WHICH WE RECORDED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019 A TOTAL GAIN OF $21.1 MILLION AS A REDUCTION OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDES OUR RECEIPT OF A ONE-TIME CASH PAYMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $13.0 MILLION AS WELL AS THE FORGIVENESS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY DUE THE CONTRACTOR. WE ALSO RECEIVED HARDWARE AND RELATED MAINTENANCE SERVICE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $0.8 MILLION AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT.  IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER OF 2018, WE INITIATED A MULTIYEAR CRM PROJECT TO FURTHER DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND DEPLOY A THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION WE LICENSED. THIS NEW SOLUTION IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, CAPABILITY AND INFORMATION FLOW AS WELL AS INCREASE AUTOMATION IN SERVICING OUR CUSTOMERS. AS OF MAY 25, 2019, WE HAVE CAPITALIZED $7.9 MILLION RELATED TO OUR NEW CRM PROJECT.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cACT\u201d) WAS ENACTED, WHICH, AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS, REDUCED THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 FROM A 35.0% RATE TO A NEW 21.0% CORPORATE RATE AND IMPOSED A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON EARNINGS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED ITS ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE ACT (SEE NOTE 13, \u201cINCOME TAXES\u201d TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q).  A PORTION OF OUR SALES IS DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, INCLUDING CANADA. REVENUES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 7.9% AND 7.8% OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FOR THE THIRTEEN AND THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED MAY 25, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.

THE OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AND SUCH RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. IN ADDITION, FLUCTUATIONS IN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE MARGINS OF OUR CANADIAN BUSINESS BECAUSE A WEAKER CANADIAN DOLLAR WILL INCREASE THE COST OF MERCHANDISE AND OTHER OPERATIONAL INPUTS THAT ARE SOURCED FROM OUTSIDE OF CANADA. OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE YEARS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ANY DEVALUATION, AS COMPARED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, OF THE CANADIAN DOLLAR OR ANY OF THE CURRENCIES OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  28  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  MAY 25,  2019 COMPARED WITH THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  MAY 26,  2018  REVENUES  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  MAY 25,  2019  MAY 26,  2018  DOLLAR  CHANGE  PERCENT  CHANGE  CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS  $399,781  $379,071  $20,710  5.5%  SPECIALTY GARMENTS  37,313  34,060  3,253  9.6%  FIRST AID  16,626  14,253  2,373  16.6%  CONSOLIDATED TOTAL  $453,720  $427,384  $26,336  6.2%  THE INCREASE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY FROM OUR CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS.

LONG-TERM DEBT AND BORROWING CAPACITY  WE HAVE A $250 MILLION UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH A SYNDICATE OF BANKS, WHICH MATURES ON APRIL 11, 2021. UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WE ARE ABLE TO BORROW FUNDS AT VARIABLE INTEREST RATES BASED ON, AT OUR ELECTION, THE EURODOLLAR RATE OR A BASE RATE, PLUS IN EACH CASE A SPREAD BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FUNDED DEBT RATIO. AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS, INCLUDING A MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED FUNDED DEBT RATIO AND MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. WE TEST OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS ON A FISCAL QUARTERLY BASIS. AS OF MAY 25, 2019, THE INTEREST RATES APPLICABLE TO OUR BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WOULD BE CALCULATED AS LIBOR PLUS 75 BASIS POINTS AT THE TIME OF THE RESPECTIVE BORROWING. AS OF MAY 25, 2019, WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AND HAD OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AMOUNTING TO $71.8 MILLION, LEAVING $178.2 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  AS OF MAY 25, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES  IN JUNE 2018, WE ENTERED INTO TWELVE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO EXCHANGE CAD FOR U.S. DOLLARS AT FIXED EXCHANGE RATES IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE RELATED TO CERTAIN FORECASTED CAD DENOMINATED SALES OF ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE SPECIFIED AS THE FIRST AMOUNT OF CAD DENOMINATED REVENUES INVOICED BY ONE OF OUR DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES EACH FISCAL QUARTER, BEGINNING IN THE THIRD FISCAL QUARTER OF 2019 AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF 2022. IN TOTAL, WE WILL SELL APPROXIMATELY 10.7 MILLION CAD AT AN AVERAGE CANADIAN-DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE OF 0.7814 OVER THESE QUARTERLY PERIODS. WE CONCLUDED THAT THE FORWARD CONTRACTS MET THE CRITERIA TO QUALIFY AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE UNDER U.S. GAAP.  AS OF MAY 25, 2019, WE HAD FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH A NOTIONAL VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY 10.7 MILLION CAD OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS OF $0.2 MILLION IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS AND $0.1 MILLION IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS WITH A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS OF $0.2 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED NET OF TAX. DURING THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED MAY 25, 2019, WE RECLASSIFIED $0.1 MILLION FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS TO REVENUE, RELATED TO THE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE GAIN ON THESE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT RESULTED IN A DECREASE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AS OF MAY 25, 2019 IS EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO REVENUES PRIOR TO ITS MATURITY ON FEBRUARY 25, 2022.

WE ARE ATTENTIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS SURROUNDING THE DISPOSAL OF THESE MATERIALS AND HAVE, THROUGH THE YEARS, TAKEN MEASURES TO AVOID THEIR IMPROPER DISPOSAL. OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE SETTLED, OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF, ACTIONS OR CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US RELATING TO THE DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO EXPEND MATERIAL AMOUNTS TO REMEDIATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH DISPOSAL IN THE FUTURE.  U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR CONTINGENCIES BE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF A LIABILITY, AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT TO BE RECORDED. WE REGULARLY CONSULT WITH ATTORNEYS AND OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS IN OUR CONSIDERATION OF THE RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE RECORDING A CONTINGENT LIABILITY. CHANGES IN ENACTED LAWS, REGULATORY ORDERS OR DECREES, OUR ESTIMATES OF COSTS, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES, INSURANCE PROCEEDS, PARTICIPATION BY OTHER PARTIES, THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS, THE INPUT OF OUR ATTORNEYS AND OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS OR OTHER FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES.  34  UNDER  ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, AN OWNER OR LESSEE OF REAL ESTATE MAY BE LIABLE FOR THE COSTS OF REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION OF CERTAIN HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES LOCATED ON, OR IN, OR EMANATING FROM SUCH PROPERTY, AS WELL AS RELATED COSTS OF INVESTIGATION AND PROPERTY  DAMAGE. SUCH LAWS OFTEN IMPOSE LIABILITY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE OWNER OR LESSEE KNEW OF, OR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR, THE PRESENCE OF SUCH HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT ACQUIRED OR LEASED LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN OPERATED IN  COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR THAT FUTURE USES OR CONDITIONS WILL NOT RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY UPON OUR COMPANY UNDER SUCH LAWS OR EXPOSE OUR COMPANY TO THIRD PARTY ACTIONS SUCH AS TORT SUITS. WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS ENV  IRONMENTAL CONDITIONS UNDER TERMS OF CONSENT ORDERS NEGOTIATED WITH THE APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL AUTHORITIES OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO SITES LOCATED IN OR RELATED TO WOBURN, MASSACHUSETTS, SOMERVILLE, MASSACHUSETTS, SPRINGFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS, UVALDE, T  EXAS, STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA, TWO SITES RELATED TO FORMER OPERATIONS IN WILLIAMSTOWN, VERMONT, AS WELL AS SITES LOCATED IN GOLDSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA AND WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA.  WE HAVE ACCRUED CERTAIN COSTS RELATED TO THE SITES DESCRIBED ABOVE AS IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE COSTS ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. WE HAVE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE RELATED TO A PARCEL OF LAND (THE \u201cCENTRAL AREA\u201d) RELATED TO THE WOBURN, MASSACHUSETTS SITE MENTIONED ABOVE. CURRENTLY, THE CONSENT DECREE FOR THE WOBURN SITE DOES NOT DEFINE OR REQUIRE ANY REMEDIATION WORK IN THE CENTRAL AREA. THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (THE \u201cEPA\u201d) HAS PROVIDED US AND OTHER SIGNATORIES TO THE CONSENT DECREE WITH COMMENTS ON THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF GROUNDWATER AND SOIL REMEDIES AT THE WOBURN SITE AND INVESTIGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN THE CENTRAL AREA. WE, AND OTHER SIGNATORIES, HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND PROPOSED TO DO ADDITIONAL WORK AT THE WOBURN SITE BUT MANY OF THE EPA\u2019S COMMENTS REMAIN TO BE RESOLVED. WE HAVE ACCRUED COSTS TO PERFORM CERTAIN WORK RESPONSIVE TO EPA\u2019S COMMENTS. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED MITIGATION MEASURES AND CONTINUE TO MONITOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AT THE SOMERVILLE, MASSACHUSETTS SITE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RECEIVED DEMANDS FROM THE LOCAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW MUNICIPAL TRANSIT STATION IN THE AREA OF THE SOMERVILLE SITE. THIS STATION IS PART OF THE EXTENSION OF THE TRANSIT SYSTEM. WE HAVE RESERVED FOR COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS MATTER; HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MATTER, THESE COSTS AND THE RELATED RESERVE MAY CHANGE. WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED NOTICE THAT THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IS CONDUCTING AN AUDIT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION WORK WITH RESPECT TO THE SOMERVILLE SITE.  WE ROUTINELY REVIEW AND EVALUATE SITES THAT MAY REQUIRE REMEDIATION AND MONITORING AND DETERMINE OUR ESTIMATED COSTS BASED ON VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE DEVELOPED USING OUR INTERNAL SOURCES OR BY THIRD PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERS OR OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS. INTERNALLY DEVELOPED ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON.  \u2022  MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT AND EXPERIENCE IN REMEDIATING AND MONITORING OUR SITES;  \u2022  INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM REGULATORY AGENCIES AS TO COSTS OF REMEDIATION AND MONITORING;  \u2022  THE NUMBER, FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND RELATIVE DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY OF OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (\u201cPRPS\u201d) WHO MAY BE LIABLE FOR REMEDIATION AND MONITORING OF A SPECIFIC SITE; AND  \u2022  THE TYPICAL ALLOCATION OF COSTS AMONG PRPS.  THERE IS USUALLY A RANGE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH SITE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, OUR ACCRUALS REFLECT THE AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE THAT WE BELIEVE IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OR THE LOW END OF A RANGE OF ESTIMATES IF NO POINT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE. WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT BOTH THE AMOUNT OF A PARTICULAR LIABILITY AND THE TIMING OF THE PAYMENTS ARE RELIABLY DETERMINABLE, WE ADJUST THE COST IN CURRENT DOLLARS USING A RATE OF 3% FOR INFLATION UNTIL THE TIME OF EXPECTED PAYMENT AND DISCOUNT THE COST TO PRESENT VALUE USING CURRENT RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES. AS OF MAY 25, 2019, THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES WE UTILIZED RANGED FROM 2.3% TO 2.8%.  FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCOUNTED, WE INCLUDE INTEREST ACCRETION, BASED ON THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD, IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE CHANGES TO THE AMOUNTS OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED MAY 25, 2019 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).

ANNUAL PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION ARE DEPOSITED INTO AN ESCROW ACCOUNT WHICH FUNDS REMEDIATION AND MONITORING COSTS FOR TWO SITES RELATED TO OUR FORMER OPERATIONS IN WILLIAMSTOWN, VERMONT. ANNUAL PROCEEDS RECEIVED BUT NOT EXPENDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR ACCUMULATE IN THIS ACCOUNT AND MAY BE USED IN FUTURE YEARS FOR COSTS RELATED TO THIS SITE THROUGH THE YEAR 2027. AS OF MAY 25, 2019, THE BALANCE IN THIS ESCROW ACCOUNT, WHICH IS HELD IN A TRUST AND IS NOT RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, WAS APPROXIMATELY $4.2 MILLION. ALSO INCLUDED IN ESTIMATED INSURANCE PROCEEDS ARE AMOUNTS WE ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PURSUANT TO LEGAL SETTLEMENTS AS REIMBURSEMENTS FROM THREE INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR ESTIMATED COSTS AT THE SITE IN UVALDE, TEXAS.  OUR NUCLEAR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION FACILITIES ARE LICENSED BY THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (\u201cNRC\u201d), OR, IN CERTAIN CASES, BY THE APPLICABLE STATE AGENCY, AND ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. WE ALSO HAVE NUCLEAR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION FACILITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE NETHERLANDS. THESE FACILITIES ARE LICENSED AND REGULATED BY THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRY\u2019S APPLICABLE FEDERAL AGENCY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH REGULATION WILL NOT LEAD TO MATERIAL DISRUPTIONS IN OUR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION BUSINESS.  DURING FISCAL 2017, WE RECORDED A PRE-TAX NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $55.8 MILLION ONCE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED WOULD BE COMPLETED AND PLACED INTO SERVICE. ON DECEMBER 28, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR LEAD CONTRACTOR FOR THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO WHICH WE RECORDED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019 A TOTAL GAIN OF $21.1 MILLION AS A REDUCTION OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDES OUR RECEIPT OF A ONE-TIME CASH PAYMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $13.0 MILLION AS WELL AS THE FORGIVENESS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY DUE THE CONTRACTOR. WE ALSO RECEIVED HARDWARE AND RELATED MAINTENANCE SERVICE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $0.8 MILLION AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, CUSTOMER CONTRACT MATTERS, EMPLOYMENT CLAIMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  WHILE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO ASCERTAIN THE ULTIMATE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, INCLUDING LAWSUITS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES, WE BELIEVE THAT THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SUCH LIABILITIES, IF ANY, IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS COVERED BY INSURANCE HAVE BEEN PROPERLY ACCRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT THE FUTURE FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR FUTURE PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE CONTINGENCIES OR CHANGES OUT OF OUR CONTROL.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF MAY 25, 2019, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGULATION S-K.  SEASONALITY  HISTORICALLY, OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS HAVE VARIED FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE. THESE FLUCTUATIONS HAVE BEEN DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING: GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN OUR MARKETS; THE TIMING OF ACQUISITIONS AND OF COMMENCING START-UP OPERATIONS AND RELATED COSTS; OUR EFFECTIVENESS IN INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND START-UP OPERATIONS; THE TIMING OF NUCLEAR PLANT OUTAGES; CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; SEASONAL RENTAL AND PURCHASING PATTERNS OF OUR CUSTOMERS; AND PRICE CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS. IN ADDITION, OUR OPERATING RESULTS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN LOWER DURING THE SECOND AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS THAN DURING THE OTHER QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY HISTORICAL QUARTER ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR AN ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR OR ANY OTHER INTERIM PERIODS.  36  EFFECTS OF INFLATION  IN GENERAL, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON MODERATE CHANGES IN THE INFLATION RATE. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE THE IMPACTS OF MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN INFLATION RATES THROUGH OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS THAT GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR PRICE INCREASES CONSISTENT WITH THE RATE OF INFLATION, AND CONTINUED FOCUS ON IMPROVEMENTS OF OPERATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  AS OF MAY 25, 2019, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT WERE DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 25, 2018.

OUR VIRTUALIZATION SUBCONTRACT PROJECT SALES DECREASED BY  APPROXIMATELY 33% FROM 2017 TO 2018. OUR GOAL IS TO EXPAND OUR  VMWARE BUSINESS IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND COMMERCIAL SECTOR BY  BUILDING VMWARE LICENSE SALES VOLUME AND SERVICES CONCURRENTLY  DIRECTLY WITH CUSTOMERS RATHER THAN RELYING ON SUBCONTRACT PROJECT  SERVICES. SALES OF NODEWARE THROUGH OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS AND OTHER  IT PROJECTS COMPRISED THE BALANCE OF OUR SALES.

WE ALSO REDUCED  OUR USE OF A MARKETING CONSULTANTS BY APPROXIMATELY $1,300 AND  $35,200 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. WE  REVISED OUR NODEWARE AND COMMERCIAL SME MARKETING EFFORTS TO USING  MORE ON-LINE AND INTERNET BASED MARKETING AND SELLING  TECHNIQUES.  OPERATING  LOSS  THE  REDUCTION IN OUR OPERATING LOSS IS PRINCIPALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN  IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN AND DECREASES IN SELLING EXPENSES  AS  EXPLAINED ABOVE  FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2018 AS COMPARED TO 2017.  INTEREST  EXPENSE  THE  INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE IS PRINCIPALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A NET  INCREASE IN LONG-TERM DEBT TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS  AND AN INCREASE IN  THE INTEREST RATES  . THE PRIME RATE INCREASED FROM 4.0% AT  DECEMBER 31, 2017 TO 4.75% ON MARCH 22, 2018 AND TO 5.00% ON JUNE  14, 2018 INCREASED OUR FINANCING COSTS UNDER OUR ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE FINANCING LINE AND OUR LINE OF CREDIT PAYABLE TO A  RELATED PARTY.  NET  LOSS  THE  DECREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ITEMS DISCUSSED ABOVE FOR THE THREE  AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 AS COMPARED TO  2017.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT JUNE  30, 2018, WE HAD CASH OF $4,446 AVAILABLE FOR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS  AND PLANNED CAPITAL ASSET EXPENDITURES. DURING 2018, WE FINANCED  OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY  OPERATIONS, SALES WITH RECOURSE OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND  BORROWINGS FROM RELATED PARTIES.

THIS PROVIDES US WITH THE CASH NEEDED TO  FINANCE CERTAIN OF OUR ON-GOING COSTS AND EXPENSES. AT JUNE 30,  2018, WE HAD FINANCING AVAILABILITY, BASED ON ELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE, OF APPROXIMATELY $11,000 UNDER THIS LINE.

WE PLAN TO  RENEGOTIATE THE TERMS OF THE NOTES PAYABLE, SEEK FUNDS TO REPAY THE  NOTES OR USE A COMBINATION OF BOTH ALTERNATIVES.

ON JULY 4, 2018, THE COMPANY, AFTER RECEIVING 3RD PARTY LAB RESULTS THAT REPORTED IMPURITIES ABOVE ALLOWABLE LIMITS FOR BATTERY-GRADE LI2CO3, PROVIDED FORMAL NOTICE OF TERMINATION TO GWT OF THE COMMERCIALIZATION AGREEMENT DATED DECEMBER 6, 2016 AND  AS AMENDED ON OCTOBER 9, 2017.  ON AUGUST 31, 2018, WE CLOSED THE FIRST TRANCHE OF A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF 4,400,000 UNITS AT A PRICE OF CAD$0.03 PER UNIT FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF CAD$132,000.

THE BROKER WARRANTS HAVE THE SAME TERMS AS THE WARRANTS ISSUED AS PART OF THE UNIT OFFERING.  ON AUGUST 31, 2018, WE ISSUED 170,000 SHARES FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF $9,000 FROM THE EXERCISE OF 50,000 STOCK OPTIONS AT $0.06 AND 120,000 STOCK OPTIONS AT $0.05 RESPECTIVELY.  OUR CURRENT BUSINESS  WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY PURSUING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN DIVERSE SECTORS NATURAL RESOURCE AND TECHNOLOGY USED IN THE RESOURCE SECTOR CURRENTLY SPECIFIC TO THE EXTRACTION, RECOVERY AND CONCENTRATION OF LITHIUM.  MINERAL PROPERTY  ON AUGUST 30, 2017, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE STAKING OF LODE AND PLACER CLAIMS OF BLM LANDS IN ESMERALDA COUNTY NEVADA COVERING APPROXIMATELY 160 ACRES SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT. THE COMPANY HAS AN 100% INTEREST IN THE LANDS AND IS ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR  THE YEARLY MAINTENANCE FEES TO THE BLM (ESTIMATED TO BE $2,635) AND COUNTY (ESTIMATED TO BE $212) DUE NOVEMBER 1, 2018 TO KEEP ITS 100% INTEREST. DURING THE YEAR ENDING AUGUST 31, 2018, THE COMPANY PAID $2,859 IN MAINTENANCE FEES. THE  CLAIMS ARE IN GOOD STANDING UNTIL AUGUST 31, 2019. AS AT MAY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED BLM AND COUNTY COSTS OF $NIL AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE SAMPLING, ASSAYING AND 3  RD  PARTY DRILLING AND LAB TESTING OF $131,701.  ACCESS TO THE PROPERTY CAN BE ACHIEVED BY PAVED HWY 265 TO SILVER SPRINGS, NV OR PAVED HWY FROM NORTH OF GOLDFIELDS, NV. ACCESS IS THEN BY GRADED GRAVEL ROAD. THE LAST 1.8 MILES TO THE PROPERTY IS BY TRAIL ROAD USING 4X4 VEHICLE. THE PROPERTY IS  COVERED WITH EXTENSIVE OUTCROPPINGS OF THE ESMERALDA FORMATION. POWER TRANSMISSION LINE IS WITHIN 1\u20442 MILE OF THE NORTHERN PROPERTY BOUNDARY. WATER WOULD HAVE TO BE TRUCKED IN OR BY PIPE LINE IF A PROCESSING FACILITY WAS BUILT ONSITE. OF  PARTICULAR INTEREST IS A SECTION OF GREEN, VOLCANOCLASTIC, EVAPORATE-RICH MUDSTONE STRATA KNOWN AS THE FRONTERA VERDE ZONE THAT HOST LITHIUM OF POTENTIAL ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE. THE FRONTERA VERDE ZONE IS EXPOSED OVER APPROXIMATELY 100 ACRES OF THE  NORTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE PROPERTY, AND UNDERLIES THE REST OF THE PROPERTY AT SHALLOW DEPTHS. THIRD PARTY DRILLING ADJACENT TO THE WEST AND EASTERN BOUNDARIES OF THE PROPERTY SUPPORTS THIS ANALYSIS. THE PROPERTY IS WITHOUT KNOWN RESERVES AND THE  CURRENT WORK PROGRAMS ARE EXPLORATORY IN NATURE.  CURRENT EXPLORATION IS AT THE GRASS ROOTS STAGE WITH SURFACE SAMPLING AND TWO SMALL 250 POUND BULK SAMPLES BEING TAKEN IN 2017. THE COMPANY COMPLETED ADDITIONAL LABORATORY TESTING OF SYNTHETIC BRINES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EVALUATE OFF THE SHELF  TECHNOLOGY TO DETERMINE THE PREFERRED METHODS FOR POTENTIALLY PRODUCING COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS FROM THE PROCESSING OF SYNTHETIC BRINES.  ON NOVEMBER 5, 2018, THE COMPANY RECEIVED AN AREA OF DISTURBANCE PERMIT FROM THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT, NEVADA, ALLOWING THE COMPANY ACCESS FOR A SERIES OF DIAMOND DRILL HOLES. IN CONNECTION WITH THE AREA OF DISTURBANCE PERMIT THE COMPANY POSTED  A BOND OF $6,520 TO INSURE COMPLETION OF FUTURE RESTORATION OBLIGATIONS, IF NECESSARY. OTHERWISE, THE BOND WILL BE RETURNED TO THE COMPANY. THE DIAMOND DRILL PROGRAM WAS COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 2018 AND CONSISTED OF 5 DIAMOND DRILL HOLES TOTALING  APPROXIMATELY 2,000 FEET. FOUR DRILL HOLES WERE FOR RESOURCE DEFINITION DRILLING TO ALLOW THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE AN INAUGURAL 43-101 PROJECT WIDE LITHIUM RESOURCE. A FIFTH DIAMOND DRILL HOLE DRILLED TO AN ESTIMATED DEPTH OF APPROXIMATELY 265 FEET  WITH THE RECOVERED LITHIUM ENRICHED MATERIAL BEING USED FOR METALLURGICAL AND PH SOLUTION TESTING. THE COMPANY WILL UNDERTAKE SYSTEMATIC AND THROUGH SOLUTION TESTING OF THE DRILLED LITHIUM ENRICHED HORIZONS. THIS WILL ENABLE THE COMPANY TO MAP THE  SUBSURFACE HORIZONS AS PER OXIDE AND REDUCED HORIZONS AND FURTHER DIFFERENTIATE THE GRADE OF LITHIUM IN SOLUTION THAT CAN BE POTENTIALLY RECOVERED IN A LOW CAPEX AND LOW-COST EXTRACTION METHODS.

(\"GWT\") WITH REGARD TO  THE ACQUISITION BY ENERTOPIA OF THE EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE LICENSING RIGHTS (THE  \"LICENSING RIGHTS\") BY ENERTOPIA OF ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGY USED IN THE PROCESS OF  RECOVERING AND EXTRACTION OF BATTERY GRADE LITHIUM CARBONATE POWDER LI2CO3  GRADING 99.5% OR HIGHER PURITY FROM BRINE SOLUTIONS.  UPON THE EXECUTION OF THIS LOI, ENERTOPIA ISSUED 250,000 COMMON  SHARES VALUED AT $12,500 TO GWT.  ON DECEMBER 6, 2016, AND AMENDED ON OCTOBER 9, 2017, ENERTOPIA  AND GWT SIGNED A DEFINITIVE COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE ACQUISITION  BY ENERTOPIA OF THE EXCLUSIVE LICENSING RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES OF  AMERICA,  ARGENTINA, BOLIVIA AND CHILE OF ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGY USED IN THE PROCESS OF RECOVERING AND EXTRACTION OF BATTERY GRADE LITHIUM CARBONATE POWDER LI2CO3 GRADING 99.5% OR HIGHER PURITY FROM BRINE SOLUTIONS.  ON JULY 4, 2018, THE COMPANY PROVIDED GWT WITH A FORMAL NOTICE OF TERMINATION OF THE COMMERCIALIZATION AGREEMENT. FOLLOWING TERMINATION, THE COMPANY HAS NO FURTHER OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMERCIALIZATION AGREEMENT. AS A RESULT, FOR THE  YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018, THE COMPANY WROTE OFF CAPITALIZED COSTS OF $12,500.  ON MAY 23, 2019 THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE 3  RD  PHASE OF GRAIN SORTING TESTING RESULTS. WITH THE GOAL OF THIS ROUND OF TESTING TO SHOW THAT POTENTIALLY PRE-SORTING OF THE LITHIUM HOSTED CLAYSTONE MATERIAL COULD BE CONCENTRATED, THESE TESTS  ARE ONGOING, AND THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO CONCENTRATE ON USING OFF THE SHELF TECHNOLOGY UNDER A POTENTIAL LOW CAPEX SCENARIO.  SUMMARY  THE CONTINUATION OF OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT UPON OBTAINING FURTHER FINANCING, A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM OF DEVELOPMENT, AND, FINALLY, ACHIEVING A PROFITABLE LEVEL OF OPERATIONS. THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES BY US COULD RESULT IN A  SIGNIFICANT DILUTION IN THE EQUITY INTERESTS OF OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS. OBTAINING COMMERCIAL LOANS, ASSUMING THOSE LOANS WOULD BE AVAILABLE, WILL INCREASE OUR LIABILITIES AND FUTURE CASH COMMITMENTS.  THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FURTHER FUNDS REQUIRED FOR OUR CONTINUED OPERATIONS. AS NOTED HEREIN, WE ARE PURSUING VARIOUS FINANCING ALTERNATIVES TO MEET OUR IMMEDIATE AND LONG-TERM FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. THERE CAN BE NO  ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US WHEN NEEDED OR, IF AVAILABLE, THAT IT CAN BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN THE ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO CONDUCT  OUR OPERATIONS AS PLANNED, AND WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET OUR OTHER OBLIGATIONS AS THEY BECOME DUE. IN SUCH EVENT, WE WILL BE FORCED TO SCALE DOWN OR PERHAPS EVEN CEASE OUR OPERATIONS. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER WE CAN OBTAIN  ADDITIONAL FINANCING.  COMPETITION  THERE IS STRONG COMPETITION RELATING TO ALL ASPECTS OF THE RESOURCE SECTOR. WE ACTIVELY COMPETE FOR CAPITAL, SKILLED PERSONNEL, MARKET SHARE, AND IN ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR OPERATIONS WITH A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. THESE  ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDE SMALL DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANIES LIKE OUR OWN, AND LARGE, ESTABLISHED COMPANIES, MANY OF WHICH HAVE GREATER TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN OUR COMPANY.  COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION  THE EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF MINERAL PROPERTIES IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS. WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME, BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN LICENSES AND PERMITS FROM VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL  AUTHORITIES IN REGARDS TO THE EXPLORATION OF OUR PROPERTY INTERESTS.  PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITION  NOT APPLICABLE  CORPORATE OFFICES  THE ADDRESS OF OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICE IS #22-1873 SPALL ROAD, KELOWNA, BRITISH COLUMBIA V1Y 4R2. OUR TELEPHONE NUMBER IS (250) 870-2219. OUR CURRENT LOCATION PROVIDES ADEQUATE OFFICE SPACE FOR OUR PURPOSES AT THIS STAGE OF OUR  DEVELOPMENT.  EMPLOYEES  WE PRIMARILY USED THE SERVICES OF SUB-CONTRACTORS AND CONSULTANTS FOR OUR INTENDED BUSINESS OPERATIONS. OUR TECHNICAL CONSULTANT IS MR. MCALLISTER, OUR PRESIDENT AND A DIRECTOR.  WE ENTERED INTO A CONSULTING AGREEMENT WITH MR. ROBERT MCALLISTER ON DECEMBER 1, 2007. DURING THE TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT, MR. MCALLISTER IS TO PROVIDE CORPORATE ADMINISTRATION AND CONSULTING SERVICES, SUCH DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES TO INCLUDE  PROVISION OF OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY CONSULTING SERVICES, STRATEGIC CORPORATE AND FINANCIAL PLANNING, MANAGEMENT OF THE OVERALL BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, AND SUPERVISING OFFICE STAFF AND EXPLORATION  AND OIL & GAS CONSULTANTS. MR. MCALLISTER IS REIMBURSED AT THE RATE OF $2,000 PER MONTH. ON DECEMBER 1, 2008, THE CONSULTING FEE WAS INCREASED TO $5,000 PER MONTH. WE MAY TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE BASED ON A NUMBER OF  CONDITIONS. MR. MCALLISTER MAY TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME BY GIVING 30 DAYS WRITTEN NOTICE OF HIS INTENTION TO DO SO. EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2014, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NEW MANAGEMENT CONSULTING AGREEMENT REPLACING THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT  WITH A CONSULTING FEE OF $6,500 PLUS GST PER MONTH. EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2017, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NEW MANAGEMENT CONSULTING AGREEMENT REPLACING THE MARCH 1, 2014 AGREEMENT WITH A CONSULTING FEE OF $3,500 PLUS GST PER MONTH. ON JULY 31,  2017 MR. MCALLISTER AGREED TO BE INTERN CFO UNTIL SUCH TIME AS A REPLACEMENT COULD BE SOURCED.  WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTH PERIOD. WE DO AND WILL CONTINUE TO OUTSOURCE CONTRACT EMPLOYMENT AS NEEDED.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT ARE MATERIAL TO STOCKHOLDERS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT  AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENT'S APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. WE BELIEVE THAT UNDERSTANDING THE BASIS AND NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES AND  ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED WITH THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS CRITICAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIALS.  MINERAL PROPERTIES  ACQUISITION COSTS OF MINERAL RIGHTS ARE INITIALLY CAPITALIZED AS INCURRED WHILE EXPLORATION AND PRE-EXTRACTION EXPENDITURES ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED UNTIL SUCH TIME PROVEN OR PROBABLE RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED FOR THAT PROJECT. ACQUISITION COSTS  INCLUDE CASH CONSIDERATION AND THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF SHARES ISSUED ON THE ACQUISITION OF MINERAL PROPERTIES.  EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND EXPENDITURES RELATING TO PRE-EXTRACTION ACTIVITIES ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED UNTIL SUCH TIME PROVEN OR PROBABLE RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED FOR THAT PROJECT, AFTER WHICH  SUBSEQUENT EXPENDITURES RELATING TO DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES FOR THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT ARE CAPITALIZED AS INCURRED.  WHERE PROVEN AND PROBABLE RESERVES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE PROJECT\u2019S CAPITALIZED EXPENDITURES ARE DEPLETED OVER PROVEN AND PROBABLE RESERVES USING THE UNITS-OF-PRODUCTION METHOD UPON COMMENCEMENT OF PRODUCTION. WHERE PROVEN AND PROBABLE  RESERVES HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE PROJECT\u2019S CAPITALIZED EXPENDITURES ARE DEPLETED OVER THE ESTIMATED EXTRACTION LIFE USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD UPON COMMENCEMENT OF EXTRACTION. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ESTABLISHED PROVEN OR PROBABLE  RESERVES FOR ANY OF ITS PROJECTS.  THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE MINERAL RIGHTS ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT BY MANAGEMENT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND AS REQUIRED WHENEVER INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT EXIST. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE CARRYING VALUE IS NOT  RECOVERABLE AND EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE.  LONG-LIVED ASSETS IMPAIRMENT  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 360, \u201cACCOUNTING FOR IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG LIVED ASSETS\u201d, THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG LIVED ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR RECOVERABILITY WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT ITS CARRYING AMOUNT  MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE SUM OF THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES, IF ANY, ARE MEASURED AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE  ASSET OVER ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM PRODUCT SALES WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, TITLE TO PRODUCT AND ASSOCIATED RISK OF LOSS HAS PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, THE PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, COLLECTION FROM THE CUSTOMER IS  REASONABLY ASSURED, THE COMPANY HAS NO FURTHER PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, AND RETURNS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.  GOING CONCERN  WE HAVE SUFFERED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS. THE CONTINUATION OF OUR COMPANY AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR COMPANY ATTAINING AND MAINTAINING PROFITABLE OPERATIONS AND/OR RAISING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT  INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENT RELATING TO THE RECOVERY AND CLASSIFICATION OF RECORDED ASSET AMOUNTS OR THE AMOUNT AND CLASSIFICATION OF LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SHOULD OUR COMPANY DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS.  THE CONTINUATION OF OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT UPON US RAISING ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND/OR ATTAINING AND MAINTAINING PROFITABLE LEVELS OF INTERNALLY GENERATED REVENUE. THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES BY US COULD RESULT IN A  SIGNIFICANT DILUTION IN THE EQUITY INTERESTS OF OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS. OBTAINING COMMERCIAL LOANS, ASSUMING THOSE LOANS WOULD BE AVAILABLE, WILL INCREASE OUR LIABILITIES AND FUTURE CASH COMMITMENTS.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-07, WHICH SIMPLIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE AMENDMENTS SPECIFY THAT TOPIC 718 APPLIES TO ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH A GRANTOR ACQUIRES GOODS OR  SERVICES TO BE USED OR CONSUMED IN A GRANTOR\u2019S OWN OPERATIONS BY ISSUING SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS. THE STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR 2020, ALTHOUGH EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED (BUT NO SOONER THAN  THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606). WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS ASU WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2016, TOPIC 842, LEASES WAS ISSUED TO REPLACE THE LEASES REQUIREMENTS IN TOPIC 840, LEASES. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PREVIOUS GAAP AND TOPIC 842 IS THE RECOGNITION OF LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES BY LESSEES FOR THOSE LEASES  CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES UNDER PREVIOUS GAAP. A LESSEE SHOULD RECOGNIZE IN THE BALANCE SHEET A LIABILITY TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS (THE LEASE LIABILITY) AND A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET REPRESENTING ITS RIGHT TO USE THE UNDERLYING ASSET FOR THE LEASE  TERM. FOR LEASES WITH A TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS, A LESSEE IS PERMITTED TO MAKE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION BY CLASS OF UNDERLYING ASSET NOT TO RECOGNIZE LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES. IF A LESSEE MAKES THIS ELECTION, IT SHOULD RECOGNIZE  LEASE EXPENSE FOR SUCH LEASES GENERALLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. THE ACCOUNTING APPLIED BY A LESSOR IS LARGELY UNCHANGED FROM THAT APPLIED UNDER PREVIOUS GAAP. TOPIC 842 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING  AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE ANNUAL PERIODS AND IS TO BE RETROSPECTIVELY APPLIED. EARLIER APPLICATION IS PERMITTED. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CASH FLOWS, AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCLOSURES.  OTHER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED OR PROPOSED BY THE FASB OR OTHER STANDARDS-SETTING BODIES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE ADOPTION UNTIL A FUTURE DATE ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON  ADOPTION.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  WE MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE  DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN OUR REPORTS  FILED UNDER THE  SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934  , AS AMENDED, IS RECORDED,  PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S RULES AND FORMS, AND THAT SUCH INFORMATION  IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRESIDENT (ALSO  OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER) AND OUR SECRETARY, TREASURER AND CHIEF  FINANCIAL OFFICER (ALSO OUR PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING OFFICER) TO ALLOW  FOR TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.  AS AT MAY 31, 2019, THE END OF OUR THIRD QUARTER COVERED BY  THIS REPORT, WE CARRIED OUT AN EVALUATION, UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE  PARTICIPATION OF OUR PRESIDENT (ALSO OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER) AND OUR  SECRETARY, TREASURER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER (ALSO OUR PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL  AND ACCOUNTING OFFICER), OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF OUR  DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. BASED ON THE FOREGOING, OUR PRESIDENT (ALSO  OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER) AND OUR SECRETARY, TREASURER AND CHIEF  FINANCIAL OFFICER (ALSO OUR PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING OFFICER)  CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE IN  PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE IN THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTS AS OF  THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS QUARTERLY REPORT.  INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF  CONTROLS  INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING HAS INHERENT  LIMITATIONS WHICH INCLUDE BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO THE USE OF INDEPENDENT  PROFESSIONALS FOR ADVICE AND GUIDANCE, INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING AND/OR  CHANGING RULES AND PRINCIPLES, SEGREGATION OF MANAGEMENT DUTIES, SCALE OF  ORGANIZATION, AND PERSONNEL FACTORS. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  IS A PROCESS WHICH INVOLVES HUMAN DILIGENCE AND COMPLIANCE AND IS SUBJECT TO  LAPSES IN JUDGMENT AND BREAKDOWNS RESULTING FROM HUMAN FAILURES. INTERNAL  CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING ALSO CAN BE CIRCUMVENTED BY COLLUSION OR  IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL  CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS ON A  TIMELY BASIS, HOWEVER THESE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ARE KNOWN FEATURES OF THE  FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS AND IT IS POSSIBLE TO DESIGN INTO THE PROCESS  SAFEGUARDS TO REDUCE, THOUGH NOT ELIMINATE, THIS RISK. THEREFORE, EVEN THOSE  SYSTEMS DETERMINED TO BE EFFECTIVE CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE WITH  RESPECT TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION. PROJECTIONS OF ANY  EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT  CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE  DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL  REPORTING  THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER  FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT OCCURRED DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 31,  2019, THAT HAVE MATERIALLY OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR  INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS TO REFLECT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OCCURRING AFTER  THE DATE OF SUCH STATEMENTS.  SUCH ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS OR OTHER \"FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS\" INVOLVE VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AS OUTLINED BELOW. WE  CAUTION READERS OF THIS PROSPECTUS THAT IMPORTANT FACTORS IN SOME CASES HAVE  AFFECTED AND, IN THE FUTURE, COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT ACTUAL RESULTS AND CAUSE  ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS EXPRESSED IN ANY SUCH  ESTIMATES, PROJECTIONS OR OTHER \"FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\". IN EVALUATING US,  OUR BUSINESS AND ANY INVESTMENT IN OUR BUSINESS, READERS SHOULD CAREFULLY  CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.  OUR COMMON SHARES ARE CONSIDERED SPECULATIVE. PROSPECTIVE  INVESTORS SHOULD CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE RISK FACTORS SET OUT BELOW.  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH BUSINESS  OUR COMPANY HAS NO OPERATING HISTORY AND AN EVOLVING  BUSINESS MODEL, WHICH RAISES DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY OR  OBTAIN FINANCING.  OUR COMPANY HAS NO OPERATING HISTORY. MOREOVER, OUR BUSINESS  MODEL IS STILL EVOLVING, SUBJECT TO CHANGE, AND WILL RELY ON THE COOPERATION AND  PARTICIPATION OF OUR JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS. OUR COMPANY'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE  AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCING  AND TO REACH PROFITABLE LEVELS OF OPERATIONS AND WE NO PROVEN HISTORY OF PERFORMANCE, EARNINGS OR SUCCESS. THERE  CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY OR OBTAIN FUTURE  FINANCING.  UNCERTAIN DEMAND FOR MINERAL RESOURCES SECTOR MAY CAUSE OUR  BUSINESS PLAN TO BE UNPROFITABLE.  DEMAND FOR MINERAL RESOURCES IS BASED ON THE WORLD ECONOMY AND  NEW TECHNOLOGIES. CURRENT LITHIUM DEMAND EXCEEDS AVAILABLE SUPPLY DUE TO THE  RAPID INCREASE IN LITHIUM BATTERIES IN PORTABLE ELECTRONICS AND THE GROWING  ELECTRIC VEHICLE MARKETS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CURRENT SUPPLY AND  DEMAND FACTORS WILL REMAIN THE SAME OR THAT PROJECTED SUPPLY AND DEMAND FACTORS  WILL ACTUALLY COME TO PASS FROM 3  RD  PARTY PROJECTIONS THAT ARE  CURRENTLY BELIEVED TO BE TRUE AND ACCURATE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT NEW  DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES WILL REPLACE LITHIUM AS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT IN  BATTERY STORAGE OVER TIME.  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN OUR COMPANY AND OUR DIRECTORS  AND OFFICERS MAY RESULT IN A LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.  OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO COMMIT THEIR  FULL TIME AND ATTENTION TO OUR BUSINESS AND, ACCORDINGLY, THEY MAY ENCOUNTER A  CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN ALLOCATING THEIR TIME BETWEEN OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS AND  THOSE OF OTHER BUSINESSES. IN THE COURSE OF THEIR OTHER BUSINESS ACTIVITIES,  THEY MAY BECOME AWARE OF INVESTMENT AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WHICH MAY BE  APPROPRIATE FOR PRESENTATION TO US AS WELL AS OTHER ENTITIES TO WHICH THEY OWE A  FIDUCIARY DUTY. AS A RESULT, THEY MAY HAVE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN DETERMINING  TO WHICH ENTITY A PARTICULAR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE PRESENTED. THEY MAY  ALSO IN THE FUTURE BECOME AFFILIATED WITH ENTITIES, ENGAGED IN BUSINESS  ACTIVITIES SIMILAR TO THOSE WE INTEND TO CONDUCT.  IN GENERAL, OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF A CORPORATION ARE  REQUIRED TO PRESENT BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES TO A CORPORATION IF.  \u2022  THE CORPORATION COULD FINANCIALLY  UNDERTAKE THE OPPORTUNITY;  \u2022  THE OPPORTUNITY IS WITHIN THE  CORPORATION\u2019S LINE OF BUSINESS; AND  \u2022  IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO THE  CORPORATION AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS NOT TO BRING THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE  ATTENTION OF THE CORPORATION.  WE PLAN TO ADOPT A CODE OF ETHICS THAT OBLIGATES OUR DIRECTORS,  OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES TO DISCLOSE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND PROHIBITS  THOSE PERSONS FROM ENGAGING IN SUCH TRANSACTIONS WITHOUT OUR CONSENT. DESPITE  OUR INTENTIONS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST MAY NEVERTHELESS ARISE WHICH MAY DEPRIVE  OUR COMPANY OF A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, WHICH MAY IMPEDE THE SUCCESSFUL  DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BUSINESS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IN  OUR COMPANY.  THE SPECULATIVE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN MAY RESULT IN  THE LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT.  OUR OPERATIONS ARE IN THE START-UP OR STAGE ONLY, AND ARE  UNPROVEN. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN IMPLEMENTING OUR BUSINESS PLAN TO BECOME  PROFITABLE. THERE MAY BE LESS DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES THAN WE ANTICIPATE. THERE  IS NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL SUCCEED AND YOU MAY LOSE YOUR ENTIRE  INVESTMENT.  CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES MAY CAUSE OUR PLANNED PRODUCTS  TO BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN THE MARKETPLACE.  THE DECISION OF A POTENTIAL CLIENT TO UNDERGO AN ENVIRONMENTAL  AUDIT OR REVIEW MAY BE BASED ON ETHICAL OR COMMERCIAL REASONS. IN SOME  INSTANCES, OR WITH CERTAIN BUSINESSES, THERE MAY BE NO ASSURANCE THAT AN  ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW WILL RESULT IN ANY COST SAVINGS OR INCREASED REVENUES. AS  SUCH, UNLESS THE ETHICAL CONSIDERATION IS ALSO A MATERIAL FACTOR, THERE MAY BE  NO INCENTIVE FOR SUCH BUSINESSES TO UNDERTAKE AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. CHANGES  IN CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL PREFERENCES, OR TRENDS, TOWARD OR AWAY FROM  ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES MAY IMPACT ON BUSINESSES\u201d DECISIONS TO UNDERGO  ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS.  GENERAL ECONOMIC FACTORS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE MARKET  FOR OUR PLANNED PRODUCTS.  THE WILLINGNESS OF BUSINESSES TO SPEND TIME AND MONEY ON ENERGY  EFFICIENCY MAY BE DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; AND ANY MATERIAL  DOWNTURN MAY REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF BUSINESSES INCURRING COSTS TOWARD WHAT  SOME BUSINESSES MAY CONSIDER A DISCRETIONARY EXPENSE ITEM.  A WIDE RANGE OF ECONOMIC AND LOGISTICAL FACTORS MAY  NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  OUR OPERATING RESULTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF  FACTORS THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY, INCLUDING THE  TIMING AND CANCELLATION OF CUSTOMER ORDERS AND PROJECTS, COMPETITIVE PRESSURES  ON PRICING, AVAILABILITY OF PERSONNEL, AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR SERVICES. AS  A RESULT, WE MAY EXPERIENCE MATERIAL FLUCTUATIONS  IN FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS ON A QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL BASIS WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.  CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CURRENTLY COMPLY WITH EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING OUR PROPOSED OPERATIONS. WHILE THERE ARE NO CURRENTLY KNOWN PROPOSED CHANGES IN THESE LAWS OR REGULATIONS, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAVE AFFECTED THE INDUSTRY  IN THE PAST AND ADDITIONAL CHANGES MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT (\u201cBLM\u201d), STATE AND POTENTIALLY OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WITH RESPECT TO ITS LITHIUM BRINE BUSINESS.  OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, REGULATIONS AND RULES PROMULGATED FROM TIME TO TIME BY GOVERNMENT. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN TYPES OF OPERATIONS REQUIRE THE SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTS. ENVIRONMENTAL  LEGISLATION IS EVOLVING IN A MANNER THAT MEANS STRICTER STANDARDS AND ENFORCEMENT. FINES AND PENALTIES FOR NON-COMPLIANCE ARE MORE STRINGENT. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS OF PROPOSED PROJECTS CARRY A HEIGHTENED DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMPANIES,  DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES. THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS HAS POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF OPERATIONS. WE INTEND TO COMPLY WITH ALL ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.  LOSS OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN OUR COMPANY OR IN OUR INDUSTRY MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS.  DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF CONSUMERS LOSE CONFIDENCE IN THE QUALITY OF OUR SERVICES OR THE INDUSTRY\u2019S PRACTICES. ADVERSE PUBLICITY MAY DISCOURAGE BUSINESSES FROM BUYING OUR SERVICES AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE  EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. VARIOUS FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REPUTATION, INCLUDING PRODUCT QUALITY INCONSISTENCIES OR CONTAMINATION RESULTING IN PRODUCT RECALLS. REPUTATIONAL RISKS MAY ALSO ARISE FROM OUR  THIRD PARTIES\u2019 LABOUR STANDARDS, HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS, RAW MATERIAL SOURCING, AND ETHICAL STANDARDS. WE MAY ALSO BE THE VICTIM OF PRODUCT TAMPERING OR COUNTERFEITING OR GREY IMPORTS. ANY LITIGATION, DISPUTES ON TAX  MATTERS AND PAY STRUCTURES MAY SUBJECT US TO NEGATIVE ATTENTION IN THE PRESS, WHICH CAN DAMAGE REPUTATION.  THE FAILURE TO SECURE CUSTOMERS MAY CAUSE OUR OPERATIONS TO FAIL.  WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS WITH ANY CUSTOMERS. MANY OF OUR SALES MAY BE ON A \u201cONETIME\u201d BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, WE WILL REQUIRE NEW CUSTOMERS ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS. RISK OF MATERIAL IMPACT ON GROUP  GROWTH AND PROFIT OF CONSUMER LED SLOWDOWN IN KEY DEVELOPING MARKETS, EXACERBATED BY INCREASING CURRENCY VOLATILITY. A VARIETY OF FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION DURING PERIODS OF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY  OR INSTABILITY, SOCIAL OR LABOUR UNREST OR POLITICAL UPHEAVAL IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. SUCH PERIODS MAY ALSO LEAD TO GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, SUCH AS IMPOSITION OF MARTIAL LAW, TRADE RESTRICTIONS, FOREIGN OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS, CAPITAL, PRICE  OR CURRENCY CONTROLS, NATIONALIZATION OR EXPROPRIATION OF PROPERTY OR OTHER RESOURCES, OR CHANGES IN LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND TAXATION REGIMES.  IF WE FAIL TO EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY ADVERTISE, THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS MAY BE COMPROMISED.  THE FUTURE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESS WILL BE DEPENDENT IN PART ON THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF OUR ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO (I) CREATE GREATER AWARENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS, (II) DETERMINE  THE APPROPRIATE CREATIVE MESSAGE AND MEDIA MIX FOR FUTURE ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES, AND (III) EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN ACCEPTABLE OPERATING MARGINS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL EXPERIENCE  BENEFITS FROM ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENDITURES IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR PLANNED ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENDITURES WILL RESULT IN INCREASED REVENUES, WILL GENERATE LEVELS OF SERVICE AND NAME  AWARENESS OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MANAGE SUCH ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENDITURES ON A COST-EFFECTIVE BASIS.  OUR SUCCESS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR UNPROVEN ABILITY TO ATTRACT QUALIFIED PERSONNEL.  WE DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM, CONSULTANTS AND ADVISORS. THERE IS STRONG COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL IN THE BUSINESS SECTOR, AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT SUCH COMPETITION  WILL INCREASE. OUR PLANNED GROWTH WILL PLACE INCREASED DEMANDS ON OUR EXISTING RESOURCES AND WILL LIKELY REQUIRE THE ADDITION OF TECHNICAL PERSONNEL AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL EXPERTISE BY EXISTING PERSONNEL.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR COMPENSATION PACKAGES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ENSURE THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL WHO ARE NECESSARY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BUSINESS.  WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY WITH LOSSES AND WE EXPECT THE LOSSES TO CONTINUE, WHICH RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  WE HAVE GENERATED MINIMAL REVENUES SINCE OUR INCEPTION AND WILL, IN ALL LIKELIHOOD, CONTINUE TO INCUR OPERATING EXPENSES WITH MINIMAL REVENUES UNTIL WE ARE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP OUR BUSINESS. OUR BUSINESS PLAN WILL REQUIRE US TO INCUR FURTHER  EXPENSES. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EVER BECOME PROFITABLE. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY AND MUST BE CONSIDERED IN THE START-UP STAGE.  THERE IS AN EXPLANATORY PARAGRAPH TO THEIR AUDIT OPINION ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 WITH RESPECT TO THEIR DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 TO  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018, WE HAVE INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $650,055 FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 (NET LOSS $801,166 FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2017) AND AS AT AUGUST 31, 2018 HAVE INCURRED CUMULATIVE  LOSSES OF $13,891,818 THAT RAISES SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. OUR MANAGEMENT HAS BEEN ABLE, THUS FAR, TO FINANCE THE OPERATIONS THROUGH EQUITY FINANCING AND CASH ON HAND. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR  COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO FINANCE OUR COMPANY ON THIS BASIS.  WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO DEVELOP OUR BUSINESS PLAN, OUR BUSINESS MAY FAIL.  BECAUSE WE HAVE GENERATED ONLY MINIMAL REVENUE FROM OUR BUSINESS AND CANNOT ANTICIPATE WHEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE MEANINGFUL REVENUE FROM OUR BUSINESS, WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO CONDUCT AND GROW OUR BUSINESS. WE DO NOT  CURRENTLY HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO COMPLETELY FUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL NEED TO RAISE FURTHER FINANCING. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ANY ARRANGEMENTS FOR FINANCING AND WE CAN PROVIDE NO  ASSURANCE TO INVESTORS THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND SUCH FINANCING IF REQUIRED. THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF FUTURE FUNDS PRESENTLY AVAILABLE TO US IS THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY CAPITAL. ANY SALE OF SHARE CAPITAL WILL RESULT IN DILUTION TO EXISTING  SECURITY-HOLDERS.  WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ALL OF THE LICENSES NECESSARY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS, WHICH WOULD CAUSE OUR BUSINESS TO FAIL.  OUR OPERATIONS REQUIRE LICENSES AND PERMITS FROM VARIOUS GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES RELATED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR PLANNED FACILITIES, TO THE PRODUCTION, STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND TO THE DISPOSAL OF WASTE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE  WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ALL NECESSARY LICENSES AND PERMITS UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS FOR OUR OPERATIONS AND BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLY IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS WITH THE TERMS OF SUCH LICENSES AND PERMITS. HOWEVER, SUCH LICENSES AND  PERMITS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE IN VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES. THERE CAN BE NO GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN ALL NECESSARY LICENSES AND PERMITS.  CHANGES IN HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATION MAY RESULT IN INCREASED OR INSUPPORTABLE FINANCIAL BURDEN ON OUR COMPANY.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CURRENTLY COMPLY WITH EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING OUR PRODUCT AND OPERATIONS. WHILE THERE ARE NO CURRENTLY KNOWN PROPOSED CHANGES IN THESE LAWS OR REGULATIONS, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAVE AFFECTED THE INDUSTRY IN THE PAST  AND ADDITIONAL CHANGES MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.  OUR PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO UNANTICIPATED REGULATIONS AND RULES PROMULGATED FROM TIME TO TIME BY GOVERNMENT, NAMELY THOSE RELATED TO CONSUMER HEALTH AND SAFETY WHICH MAY RENDER CERTAIN PRODUCTION METHODS, INGREDIENTS, PRODUCTS OR  PRACTICES OBSOLETE. THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS HAS POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE VIABILITY OR PROFITABILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS OR OPERATIONS.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RECRUIT OR RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND STOCK PRICE.  OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON THE CONTINUED SERVICES OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE KEY PERSON INSURANCE ON THESE INDIVIDUALS. THE LOSS OF THESE PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY WITHOUT ADVANCE NOTICE,  COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR STOCK PRICE. IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING TECHNICAL PERSONNEL, TO ACCOMMODATE OUR EXPLORATION PLANS AND  TO REPLACE PERSONNEL WHO LEAVE. COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED PERSONNEL CAN BE INTENSE, AND THERE  ARE A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH THE REQUISITE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE. UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, WE COULD BE UNABLE TO RECRUIT, TRAIN, AND RETAIN EMPLOYEES. IF WE CANNOT ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE  IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND STOCK PRICE.  IF WE FAIL TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR GROWTH OUR FUTURE BUSINESS RESULTS COULD BE HARMED AND OUR MANAGERIAL AND OPERATIONAL RESOURCES MAY BE STRAINED.  AS WE PROCEED WITH OUR BUSINESS PLAN, WE EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT AND RAPID GROWTH IN THE SCOPE AND COMPLEXITY OF OUR BUSINESS. WE WILL NEED TO ADD STAFF TO MARKET OUR SERVICES, MANAGE OPERATIONS, HANDLE SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS AND  PERFORM FINANCE AND ACCOUNTING FUNCTIONS. WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO HIRE A BROAD RANGE OF ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY ADVANCE OUR OPERATIONS. THIS GROWTH IS LIKELY TO PLACE A STRAIN ON OUR MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONAL RESOURCES. THE  FAILURE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE SYSTEMS, OR TO HIRE AND RETAIN SUFFICIENT PERSONNEL FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ALL OF THE FUNCTIONS NECESSARY TO EFFECTIVELY SERVICE AND MANAGE OUR POTENTIAL BUSINESS, OR THE FAILURE TO MANAGE GROWTH  EFFECTIVELY, COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHARES OF OUR COMPANY  BECAUSE WE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY ANY DIVIDENDS ON OUR SHARES, INVESTORS SEEKING DIVIDEND INCOME OR LIQUIDITY SHOULD NOT PURCHASE OUR SHARES.  WE HAVE NOT DECLARED OR PAID ANY DIVIDENDS ON OUR SHARES SINCE INCEPTION, AND DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING ANY SUCH DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE PRESENTLY DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL PAY DIVIDENDS ON ANY OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE  FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IF PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS DOES OCCUR AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE, IT WOULD BE CONTINGENT UPON OUR REVENUES AND EARNINGS, IF ANY, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND GENERAL FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE PAYMENT OF ANY COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS WILL  BE WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. WE PRESENTLY INTEND TO RETAIN ALL EARNINGS TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN; ACCORDINGLY, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THE DECLARATION OF ANY DIVIDENDS FOR COMMON STOCK IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  INVESTORS SEEKING DIVIDEND INCOME OR LIQUIDITY SHOULD NOT INVEST IN OUR SHARES.  BECAUSE WE CAN ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES, PURCHASERS OF OUR SHARES MAY INCUR IMMEDIATE DILUTION AND MAY EXPERIENCE FURTHER DILUTION.  WE ARE AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE UP TO 200,000,000 SHARES. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF OUR COMPANY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CAUSE US TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES, AND TO DETERMINE THE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND PRIVILEGES OF SUCH SHARES, WITHOUT CONSENT OF ANY OF  OUR STOCKHOLDERS. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE MORE DILUTION IN THEIR OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMPANY IN THE FUTURE.  OTHER RISKS  TRADING ON THE OCTQB AND CSE MAY BE VOLATILE AND SPORADIC, WHICH COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS TO RESELL THEIR SHARES.  OUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON THE OTCQB ELECTRONIC QUOTATION SERVICE OPERATED BY OTC MARKETS GROUP INC.. TRADING IN STOCK QUOTED ON THE OTCQB IS OFTEN THIN AND CHARACTERIZED BY WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN TRADING PRICES, DUE TO MANY FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE  LITTLE TO DO WITH OUR OPERATIONS OR BUSINESS PROSPECTS. THIS VOLATILITY COULD DEPRESS THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR REASONS UNRELATED TO OPERATING PERFORMANCE. MOREOVER, THE OTCQB IS NOT A STOCK EXCHANGE, AND TRADING OF SECURITIES ON THE  OTCQB IS OFTEN MORE SPORADIC THAN THE TRADING OF SECURITIES LISTED ON A QUOTATION SYSTEM LIKE NASDAQ OR A STOCK EXCHANGE LIKE AMEX. ACCORDINGLY, SHAREHOLDERS MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY RESELLING ANY OF THE SHARES.  OUR STOCK IS A PENNY STOCK. TRADING OF OUR STOCK MAY BE RESTRICTED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\u2019S PENNY STOCK REGULATIONS WHICH MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER\u2019S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK.  OUR STOCK IS A PENNY STOCK. THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED RULE 15G-9 WHICH GENERALLY DEFINES \u201cPENNY STOCK\u201d TO BE ANY EQUITY SECURITY THAT HAS A MARKET PRICE (AS DEFINED) LESS THAN $5.00 PER SHARE OR AN EXERCISE  PRICE OF LESS THAN $5.00 PER SHARE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. OUR SECURITIES ARE COVERED BY THE PENNY STOCK RULES, WHICH IMPOSE ADDITIONAL SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS ON BROKER-DEALERS WHO SELL TO PERSONS OTHER THAN ESTABLISHED CUSTOMERS AND \u201cACCREDITED INVESTORS\u201d. THE TERM \u201cACCREDITED INVESTOR\u201d REFERS GENERALLY TO INSTITUTIONS WITH ASSETS IN EXCESS OF $5,000,000 OR INDIVIDUALS WITH A NET WORTH IN EXCESS OF $1,000,000 OR ANNUAL INCOME  EXCEEDING $200,000 OR $300,000 JOINTLY WITH THEIR SPOUSE. THE PENNY STOCK RULES REQUIRE A BROKER-DEALER, PRIOR TO A TRANSACTION IN A PENNY STOCK NOT OTHERWISE EXEMPT FROM THE RULES, TO DELIVER A STANDARDIZED RISK DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT IN A  FORM PREPARED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WHICH PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT PENNY STOCKS AND THE NATURE AND LEVEL OF RISKS IN THE PENNY STOCK MARKET. THE BROKER-DEALER ALSO MUST PROVIDE THE CUSTOMER WITH CURRENT BID AND OFFER QUOTATIONS  FOR THE PENNY STOCK, THE COMPENSATION OF THE BROKER-DEALER AND ITS SALESPERSON IN THE TRANSACTION AND MONTHLY ACCOUNT STATEMENTS SHOWING THE MARKET VALUE OF EACH PENNY STOCK HELD IN THE CUSTOMER\u2019S ACCOUNT. THE BID AND OFFER QUOTATIONS, AND THE  BROKER-DEALER AND SALESPERSON COMPENSATION INFORMATION, MUST BE GIVEN TO THE CUSTOMER ORALLY OR IN WRITING PRIOR TO EFFECTING THE TRANSACTION AND MUST BE GIVEN TO THE CUSTOMER IN WRITING BEFORE OR WITH THE CUSTOMER\u2019S CONFIRMATION. IN ADDITION,  THE PENNY STOCK RULES REQUIRE THAT PRIOR TO A TRANSACTION IN A PENNY STOCK NOT OTHERWISE EXEMPT FROM THESE RULES, THE BROKER-DEALER MUST MAKE A SPECIAL WRITTEN DETERMINATION THAT THE PENNY STOCK IS A SUITABLE INVESTMENT FOR THE PURCHASER AND RECEIVE  THE PURCHASER\u2019S WRITTEN AGREEMENT TO THE TRANSACTION. THESE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE LEVEL OF TRADING ACTIVITY IN THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR THE STOCK THAT IS SUBJECT TO THESE PENNY STOCK RULES. CONSEQUENTLY,  THESE PENNY STOCK RULES MAY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF BROKER-DEALERS TO TRADE OUR SECURITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PENNY STOCK RULES DISCOURAGE INVESTOR INTEREST IN AND LIMIT THE MARKETABILITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY, OR FINRA, HAS ADOPTED SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS WHICH MAY ALSO LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER\u2019S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK.  IN ADDITION TO THE \u201cPENNY STOCK\u201d RULES DESCRIBED ABOVE, FINRA HAS ADOPTED RULES THAT REQUIRE THAT IN RECOMMENDING AN INVESTMENT TO A CUSTOMER, A BROKER-DEALER MUST HAVE REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR BELIEVING THAT THE INVESTMENT IS SUITABLE FOR  THAT CUSTOMER. PRIOR TO RECOMMENDING SPECULATIVE LOW PRICED SECURITIES TO THEIR NON-INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS, BROKER-DEALERS MUST MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT THE CUSTOMER\u2019S FINANCIAL STATUS, TAX STATUS, INVESTMENT  OBJECTIVES AND OTHER INFORMATION. UNDER INTERPRETATIONS OF THESE RULES, FINRA BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY THAT SPECULATIVE LOW PRICED SECURITIES WILL NOT BE SUITABLE FOR AT LEAST SOME CUSTOMERS. FINRA REQUIREMENTS MAKE IT MORE  DIFFICULT FOR BROKER-DEALERS TO RECOMMEND THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS BUY OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH MAY LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK AND HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARKET FOR OUR SHARES.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATIONS COMPLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, WITH ALL APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.  OUR OPERATING PARTNERS MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE CUSTOMARY TO THE INDUSTRY; HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT FULLY INSURED AGAINST ALL POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS.  ANY CHANGE TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION/ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE AND OUR PROFITABILITY.  THE LAWS, REGULATIONS, POLICIES OR CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES OF ANY GOVERNMENT BODY, ORGANIZATION OR REGULATORY AGENCY IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, MAY BE CHANGED, APPLIED OR INTERPRETED IN A MANNER WHICH WILL  FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER THE ABILITY OF OUR COMPANY TO CARRY ON OUR BUSINESS.  THE ACTIONS, POLICIES OR REGULATIONS, OR CHANGES THERETO, OF ANY GOVERNMENT BODY OR REGULATORY AGENCY, OR OTHER SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, MAY HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON US. ANY OR ALL OF THESE SITUATIONS MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO  OPERATE AND/OR OUR PROFITABLY.  BECAUSE WE CAN ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES, PURCHASERS OF OUR SHARES MAY INCUR IMMEDIATE DILUTION AND MAY EXPERIENCE FURTHER DILUTION.  WE ARE AUTHORIZED TO ISSUE UP TO 200,000,000 SHARES. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF OUR COMPANY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CAUSE US TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES, AND TO DETERMINE THE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND PRIVILEGES OF SUCH SHARES, WITHOUT CONSENT OF ANY OF  OUR STOCKHOLDERS. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE MORE DILUTION IN THEIR OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMPANY IN THE FUTURE.  OUR BY-LAWS CONTAIN PROVISIONS INDEMNIFYING OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AGAINST ALL COSTS, CHARGES AND EXPENSES INCURRED BY THEM.  OUR BY-LAWS CONTAIN PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE INDEMNIFICATION OF OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AGAINST ALL COSTS, CHARGES AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING AN AMOUNT PAID TO SETTLE AN ACTION OR SATISFY A JUDGMENT, ACTUALLY AND REASONABLY INCURRED BY HIM, INCLUDING AN AMOUNT PAID TO SETTLE AN ACTION  OR SATISFY A JUDGMENT IN A CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION OR  PROCEEDING TO WHICH HE IS MADE A PARTY BY REASON OF HIS BEING OR HAVING BEEN ONE  OF OUR DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS.  INVESTORS\u2019 INTERESTS IN OUR COMPANY WILL BE DILUTED AND  INVESTORS MAY SUFFER DILUTION IN THEIR NET BOOK VALUE PER SHARE IF WE ISSUE  ADDITIONAL SHARES OR RAISE FUNDS THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES.  OUR CONSTATING DOCUMENTS AUTHORIZE THE ISSUANCE OF 200,000,000  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WITH A PAR VALUE OF $0.001. IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE  REQUIRED TO ISSUE ANY ADDITIONAL SHARES OR ENTER INTO PRIVATE PLACEMENTS TO  RAISE FINANCING THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, INVESTORS\u201d INTERESTS IN  OUR COMPANY WILL BE DILUTED AND INVESTORS MAY SUFFER DILUTION IN THEIR NET BOOK  VALUE PER SHARE DEPENDING ON THE PRICE AT WHICH SUCH SECURITIES ARE SOLD. IF WE  ISSUE ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL SHARES, SUCH ISSUANCES ALSO WILL CAUSE A REDUCTION IN  THE PROPORTIONATE OWNERSHIP AND VOTING POWER OF ALL OTHER SHAREHOLDERS. FURTHER,  ANY SUCH ISSUANCE MAY RESULT IN A CHANGE IN OUR CONTROL.  OUR BY-LAWS DO NOT CONTAIN ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS, WHICH  COULD RESULT IN A CHANGE OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS IF THERE IS A TAKE-OVER  OF OUR COMPANY.  WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN OR ANY  ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS IN OUR BY-LAWS. WITHOUT ANY ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS,  THERE IS NO DETERRENT FOR A TAKE-OVER OF OUR COMPANY, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A  CHANGE IN OUR MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS.  AS A RESULT OF A MAJORITY OF OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS ARE  RESIDENTS OF OTHER COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES, INVESTORS MAY FIND IT  DIFFICULT TO ENFORCE, WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, ANY JUDGMENTS OBTAINED AGAINST  OUR COMPANY OR OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.  OTHER THAN OUR OPERATIONS OFFICE IN KELOWNA, BRITISH COLUMBIA,  WE DO NOT CURRENTLY MAINTAIN A PERMANENT PLACE OF BUSINESS WITHIN THE UNITED  STATES. IN ADDITION, A MAJORITY OF OUR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS ARE NATIONALS  AND/OR RESIDENTS OF COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES, AND ALL OR A  SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF SUCH PERSONS\u201d ASSETS ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED  STATES. AS A RESULT, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO ENFORCE WITHIN THE  UNITED STATES ANY JUDGMENTS OBTAINED AGAINST OUR COMPANY OR OUR OFFICERS OR  DIRECTORS, INCLUDING JUDGMENTS PREDICATED UPON THE CIVIL LIABILITY PROVISIONS OF  THE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OR ANY STATE THEREOF.  TRENDS, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.  WE HAVE SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST  SIGNIFICANT RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS, BUT WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER, OR TO WHAT  EXTENT, ANY OF SUCH RISKS MAY BE REALIZED NOR CAN WE GUARANTEE THAT WE HAVE  IDENTIFIED ALL POSSIBLE RISKS THAT MIGHT ARISE SUCH AS A BLACK SWAN EVENT. AN  ABSOLUTE WORST CASE SCENARIO WITH SUFFICIENT POTENTIAL IMPACT TO RISK THE FUTURE  OF THE COMPANY AS AN INDEPENDENT BUSINESS OPERATING IN ITS CHOSEN MARKETS.  SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL IMPACT AS A RESULT OF A MAJOR ISSUE RESULTING IN  MULTIPLE FATALITIES, POSSIBLY COMPOUNDED BY APPARENTLY NEGLIGENT MANAGEMENT  BEHAVIOR; EXTREME ADVERSE PRESS COVERAGE AND VIRAL SOCIAL MEDIA LINKING THE  COMPANY NAME TO CONSUMER BRANDS, LEADS TO A CATASTROPHIC SHARE PRICE FALL, VERY  SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND INABILITY TO RETAIN AND RECRUIT  QUALITY PEOPLE. INVESTORS SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER ALL OF SUCH RISK FACTORS  BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION WITH RESPECT TO OUR COMMON SHARES.  ITEM 2.

OUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON THE OTCQX UNDER THE SYMBOL \"LXRP\" AND ON THE CANADIAN SECURITIES EXCHANGE UNDER THE SYMBOL \u201cLXX\u201d.  PAGE 21 OF 49  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN 2014, THE COMPANY SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION TO ENTER THE LEGAL MEDICAL MARIJUANA BUSINESS IN CANADA AND ALSO LAUNCHED A HEMP OIL-BASED FOOD SUPPLEMENT COMPANY IN THE USA.  THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT WITH ENERTOPIA CORP FOR A PROSPECTIVE MEDICAL MARIJUANA BUSINESS UNDER THE CANADIAN MARIJUANA FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES REGULATIONS (\u201cMMPR\u201d) FOR A 49% NET OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS (ENERTOPIA 51%) UTILIZING AN IDENTIFIED LOCATION IN BURLINGTON, ONTARIO (THE \u201cBURLINGTON JOINT VENTURE\u201d).  ON JUNE 26, 2015, WE ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH ENERTOPIA CORP. AND SHAXON ENTERPRISES LTD. TO SELL OUR 49% INTEREST IN THE BURLINGTON JOINT VENTURE AND THE MMPR APPLICATION NUMBER 10MMPR0610. PURSUANT TO THE SALE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, THE JOINT VENTURE RECEIVED A NON-REFUNDABLE $10,000 DEPOSIT AND IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE UP TO $1,500,000 IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS UPON THE BURLINGTON FACILITY BECOMING LICENSED UNDER THE MMPR. ALL PAYMENTS MADE PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT WOULD BE DIVIDED 51% TO ENERTOPIA CORP. AND 49% TO OUR COMPANY. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE GRANT OF A PRODUCTION LICENSE FOR THE BURLINGTON FACILITY.

ON FEBRUARY 21, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ADDITIONAL FINDINGS UPON COMPLETION OF FURTHER DATA ANALYSES FROM ITS 2018 RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, DOUBLE-BLINDED EUROPEAN HUMAN CLINICAL STUDY THAT EVALUATED TURBOCBDTM, THE COMPANY\u2019S PROPRIETARY, DEHYDRATECHTM POWERED, CANNABIDIOL (\u201cCBD\u201d) FORTIFIED HEMP-OIL CAPSULE. A SINGLE 90MG DOSE OF TURBOCBD PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE; HIGHER BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN; FASTER DELIVERY ONSET OF CBD INTO THE BLOODSTREAM; AND, LARGER QUANTITIES OF CBD WITHIN THE BLOOD COMPARED TO A SINGLE 90MG DOSE OF GENERIC CBD.  KEY METABOLIC AND HEMODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE FINDINGS LINKED TO BIOAVAILABILITY ENHANCEMENTS WERE REVEALED IN THE STUDY, WHICH COMPARED A 90 MG DOSE OF LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM TO A 90 MG DOSE WITHOUT LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY (THE \u201cPOSITIVE CONTROL\u201d) AS WELL AS A PLACEBO, AS FOLLOWS.  \u00b7  ANALYSIS OF MEAN ARTERIAL BLOOD PRESSURE (MAP) AT PEAK BLOOD LEVELS OF CBD ACHIEVED WITH LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN MAP COMPARED TO PLACEBO (95% CI; P=0.027). THIS FINDING WAS NOT OBSERVED WITH THE DOSE-MATCHED POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION FOR WHICH THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN MAP COMPARED TO PLACEBO (95% CI; P=0.625);  \u00b7  CEREBRAL PERFUSION WAS ALSO ANALYSED BY AN INDEX OF CONDUCTANCE IN THE MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY (MCA). THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM CAUSED THE GREATEST INCREASE IN MCA CONDUCTANCE RELATIVE TO BOTH THE POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION AND PLACEBO (95% CI; P=0.017 AND P=0.002 RESPECTIVELY);  FINALLY, OVER THE SIX-HOUR STUDY, ANALYSIS OF THE TOTAL AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) DEMONSTRATED THAT LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM RESULTED IN A NOTABLE TREND FOR HIGHER LEVELS OF CBD IN THE BLOODSTREAM OVERALL THAN THE POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION WITH TOTAL AUC OF 10,865 \u00b1 6,322 OBSERVED WITH LEXARIA\u2019S FORMULATION COMPARED TO 7,115 \u00b1 2,978 OBSERVED WITH THE POSITIVE CONTROL (95% CI; P=0.096). FURTHERMORE, WHEN NORMALIZED TO BODY MASS, THE AUC AT THE PEAK CBD CONCENTRATION WAS MARKEDLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY (95% CI; P=0.02) HIGHER WITH THE TURBOCBDTM 90 MG DOSE COMPARED TO THE 90 MG DOSE POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION.  ON MARCH 20, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED AN IN VIVO RESEARCH PROGRAM TO TEST LEXARIA DESIGNED NANOTECH ENHANCEMENTS COMPRISED OF ELEVEN SEPARATE ANIMAL STUDIES. LEXARIA ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT, EFFECTIVE MARCH 15, 2019, IT TERMINATED THE DEFINITIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN LEXARIA CANPHARM ULC AND NEUTRISCI INTERNATIONAL INC. THAT WAS ORIGINALLY ANNOUNCED ON FEBRUARY 26, 2018.  ON APRIL 9, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT NEGOTIATED 3-YEAR TERM RENEWAL MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS WITH CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHRIS BUNKA AND PRESIDENT JOHN DOCHERTY. THE ANNUAL COMPENSATION PAYABLE IS CDN$350,000 WITH RESPECT TO OUR CEO AND CDN$300,000 WITH RESPECT TO OUR PRESIDENT, WITH SUCH CONTRACTS CONTEMPLATING PERFORMANCE-RELATED BONUSES.  PAGE 25 OF 49  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON APRIL 24, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE 5-YEAR AGREEMENT, VIA ITS SUBSIDIARY LEXARIA CANPHARM ULC, TO PROVIDE LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY TO A PRIVATE CALIFORNIA-BASED COMPANY FOR ITS UTILIZATION IN CERTAIN CBD-BASED BEVERAGES TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA THAT MAY INCLUDE ANY COMBINATION OF READY-TO-DRINK BEVERAGES SUCH AS NON-ALCOHOLIC BEERS, WINES AND SPIRITS; COLD OR HOT COFFEE OR TEAS, SPORTS DRINKS AND MORE.  ON MAY 7, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE 5-YEAR AGREEMENT, VIA ITS SUBSIDIARY LEXARIA HEMP CORP., TO PROVIDE LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY TO A PRIVATE NEVADA-BASED COMPANY FOR ITS UTILIZATION IN CERTAIN CBD-BASED BEVERAGES TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD ACROSS THE USA THAT MAY INCLUDE ANY COMBINATION OF READY-TO-DRINK BEVERAGES SUCH AS NON-ALCOHOLIC BEERS, WINES AND SPIRITS; COLD OR HOT COFFEE OR TEAS, SPORTS DRINKS AND MORE.  ON MAY 15, 2019, THE COMPANY RELEASED INITIAL RESULTS FROM ITS RESEARCH PROGRAM ANNOUNCED MARCH 2019 DEMONSTRATING MEASURABLE QUANTITIES OF CANNABIDIOL INTO BLOOD IN AS LITTLE AS 2 MINUTES. IN EACH ARM OF THE LEXARIA ANIMAL STUDIES, 10 MALE SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS WERE ADMINISTERED CBD AT 25MG PER KG OF BODYWEIGHT. DELIVERY OF CBD INTO THE BLOODSTREAM WAS MONITORED OVER A 60-MINUTE DURATION. IN THE FIRST ANIMAL STUDY RESULTS, LEXARIA COMPARED ITS STANDARD DEHYDRATECH FORMULATION THAT COMBINES CANNABINOIDS WITH LONG-CHAIN FATTY ACIDS (\u201cLCFA\u201d) USING LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATION PROCESSING TECHNIQUE TO A CONCENTRATION-MATCHED FORMULATION UTILIZING COCONUT OIL WHICH IS A COMMONLY USED MEDIUM CHAIN TRIGLYCERIDE (\u201cMCT\u201d) OIL IN THE CANNABIS EDIBLES INDUSTRY.  \u00b7  AT 2 MINUTES DEHYDRATECH\u2019S LCFA FORMULATION DELIVERED MEASURABLE CBD IN BLOOD, COMPARED TO NO MEASURABLE CBD IN BLOOD UNTIL 6 MINUTES AND ONWARDS FOR THE MCT OIL FORMULATION.  \u00b7  AT 15 MINUTES DEHYDRATECH\u2019S LCFA FORMULATION ACHIEVED A CBD BLOOD CONCENTRATION LEVEL THAT WAS 475% MORE THAN THE MCT OIL FORMULATION; AND, THE DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION CBD BLOOD LEVELS REACHED AT 15 MINUTES WERE GREATER THAN THE CBD BLOOD LEVELS REACHED BY THE MCT OIL FORMULATION AT ANY TIME POINT DURING THE 60-MINUTE EVALUATION.  \u00b7  AT 60 MINUTES DEHYDRATECH\u2019S LCFA FORMULATION ACHIEVED A CBD BLOOD CONCENTRATION LEVEL OF 319% MORE THAN THE MCT OIL FORMULATION.  \u00b7  OVER THE ENTIRE 60-MINUTE STUDY, THE ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED THE STANDARD DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE MAXIMUM CBD BLOOD CONCENTRATION LEVEL THAT WAS 334% MORE THAN THE AVERAGE MAXIMUM BLOOD CONCENTRATION LEVEL OF THE ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED THE MCT OIL FORMULATION (P<0.0021).  \u00b7  OVER THE ENTIRE 60-MINUTE STUDY, THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) (TOTAL QUANTITY OF CBD DELIVERED) FOR THE LEXARIA DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION WAS 389% MORE THAN THE MCT OIL FORMULATION (P<0.0011).  LEXARIA ALSO TESTED FOR BRAIN TISSUE CONCENTRATIONS TO QUANTIFY 8-HOUR CBD DELIVERY FROM THE DEHYDRATECH-ENABLED LCFA FORMULATION COMPARED TO THE MCT OIL FORMULATION AND DEHYDRATECH\u2019S LCFA FORMULATION OUTPERFORMED THE MCT OIL FORMULATION BY 246%.  ON MAY 21, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A MAJOR EXPANSION IN OPERATIONS BY NUKA ENTERPRISES LLC, (\u201cNUKA\u201d) MAKER OF 1906 EDIBLES OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS INTO ILLINOIS, OHIO, MASSACHUSETTS, MICHIGAN AND OTHER STATES. THE COMPREHENSIVE SEMI-EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT PROVIDES NUKA AND 1906 WITH COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES UNTIL 2028. A SECOND LICENSE PROVIDES NUKA AND 1906 WITH THE IMMEDIATE ABILITY TO UTILIZE DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY FOR CBD ACROSS THE US MARKETPLACE.  ON MAY 28, 2019, THE COMPANY RELEASED ADDITIONAL RESULTS FROM ITS RESEARCH PROGRAM WHEREIN ANIMAL TESTING PROVED THAT COMBINING LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY WITH GENERIC NANOTECH TECHNIQUES DELIVERS 1,137% MORE CANNABIDIOL INTO ANIMAL BRAIN TISSUE FOLLOWING ORAL INGESTION THAN CERTAIN EXISTING INDUSTRY FORMULATIONS. LEXARIA COMBINED ITS DEHYDRATECH DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY WITH A STANDARD FORM OF NANOTECHNOLOGY AND ANALYZED SUBSEQUENT DELIVERY INTO BRAIN TISSUE FOLLOWING ORAL INGESTION. IN EACH ARM OF THE LEXARIA ANIMAL STUDIES, 10 MALE SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS WERE ORALLY ADMINISTERED CBD AT THE RATE OF 25MG PER KG OF BODYWEIGHT. DELIVERY OF CBD INTO THE BRAIN WAS REPORTED 8 HOURS AFTER DOSING.  PAGE 26 OF 49  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u00b7  THE LEXARIA DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION  WITHOUT  NANOTECH ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE BRAIN TISSUE ACCUMULATION LEVEL THAT WAS 246% HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE FOR THOSE ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED THE MCT OIL FORMULATION (P=0.0013).  \u00b7  THE LEXARIA DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION WITH NANOTECH ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE BRAIN TISSUE ACCUMULATION LEVEL THAT WAS 1,137% HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE FOR THOSE ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED THE MCT OIL FORMULATION (P=0.0178).

FROM JANUARY 2015 TO DECEMBER 2015, SEVEN (7) FLAVORS OF TEAS; HOT CHOCOLATE; COFFEE, AND TWO (2) FLAVORS OF PROTEIN ENERGY BARS WERE INTRODUCED \u2013 ALL UTILIZING LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED TECHNOLOGY DEHYDRATECH FOR THE MORE PALATABLE AND EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF BIOACTIVE MOLECULES INFUSED WITHIN THOSE FOOD PRODUCTS.  IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE PRODUCTS, FOR EACH RAW MATERIAL TO BE USED IN VIPOVATM -BRANDED PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY ASSESSES IF THE PRODUCT INPUTS AND THE COMPLETED PRODUCTS COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE FOOD AND DRUG LAWS, AND THAT THE INPUTS AND THE FINISHED PRODUCTS MEET ALL APPLICABLE LEGAL AND QUALITY STANDARDS INCLUDING AND AS IT RELATES TO HEMP OIL CONTENT; THC CONTENT; MOLDS AND MILDEWS; HEAVY METALS; AND MAY MEASURE ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS.  THE US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, OWNS US PATENT #6630507, WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS, CLAIMS THAT  PAGE 27 OF 49  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u201c  CANNABINOIDS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO HAVE ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES, UNRELATED TO NMDA RECEPTOR ANTAGONISM. THIS NEW FOUND PROPERTY MAKES CANNABINOIDS USEFUL IN THE TREATMENT AND PROPHYLAXIS OF WIDE VARIETY OF OXIDATION ASSOCIATED DISEASES, SUCH AS ISCHEMIC, AGE-RELATED, INFLAMMATORY AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. THE CANNABINOIDS ARE FOUND TO HAVE PARTICULAR APPLICATION AS NEUROPROTECTANTS, FOR EXAMPLE IN LIMITING NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE FOLLOWING ISCHEMIC INSULTS, SUCH AS STROKE AND TRAUMA, OR IN THE TREATMENT OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES, SUCH AS ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND HIV DEMENTIA.\u201d  FOR REFERENCE, CANNABINOIDS ARE COMPOUNDS THAT AFFECT CANNABINOID RECEPTORS LOCATED ON MANY HUMAN CELLS. CB1 RECEPTORS ARE WIDELY FOUND WITHIN THE HUMAN BRAIN; AND CB2 RECEPTORS ARE FOUND WITH THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM AND HAVE BEEN LINKED TO ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND OTHER RESPONSES.  DESPITE INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS IN MANY LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, SOME REGULATORY AGENCIES DO NOT OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZE THAT A HUMAN ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM EXISTS.  OVER ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT CANNABINOIDS HAVE BEEN ISOLATED FROM THE CANNABIS PLANT, MOST OF WHICH DO NOT HAVE PSYCHOACTIVE PROPERTIES. ONE THAT DOES HAVE PSYCHOACTIVE PROPERTIES IS TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL (THC). ENDOCANNABINOIDS ARE PRODUCED NATURALLY IN THE HUMAN BODY WHILE PHYTOCANNABINOIDS ARE PRODUCED IN SEVERAL PLANT SPECIES, MOST ABUNDANTLY IN THE CANNABIS PLANT.  CANNABIDIOL (\u201cCBD\u201d) IS ONE OF THE MAJOR PHYTOCANNABINOID FORMS OF CANNABINOIDS AND IS NOT PSYCHOACTIVE, OFTEN CONTRIBUTING MORE THAN 35% OF THE EXTRACTS FROM THE CANNABIS PLANT RESIN. CANNABIDIOL OCCURS NATURALLY IN OTHER PLANT SPECIES BEYOND CANNABIS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MOST WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF PHYTOCANNABINOID IS IN THE BETTER UNDERSTOOD ECHINACEA SPECIES, IN WIDESPREAD USE AS A DIETARY SUPPLEMENT. MOST PHYTOCANNABINOIDS ARE VIRTUALLY INSOLUBLE IN WATER BUT ARE SOLUBLE IN LIPIDS AND ALCOHOL. THE WORLD ANTI DOPING AGENCY (\u201cWADA\u201d) HAS EXEMPTED CBD FROM ITS 2018 LIST OF BANNED SUBSTANCES.  THE ALTERNATIVE HEALTH SECTOR IS LARGE AND GROWING. A LONG-TERM MEDICAL EXPENDITURE PANEL SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED FROM 2002 UNTIL 2008 WITH AT LEAST 29,370 SUBJECTS ASKED REPEATEDLY IF THEY HAD SEEN ANY KIND OF HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER IN THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS. THE SURVEY RECORDED WHETHER THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WAS A \u201cCOMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE CARE PROFESSIONAL,\u201d INCLUDING \u201cHOMEOPATHIC, NATUROPATHIC, OR HERBALIST.\u201d  BETWEEN 5.3% AND 5.8% OF THE SURVEY GROUP AT ANY ONE TIME REPORTED THAT THEY HAD SEEN A COMPLEMENTARY OR ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE PROVIDER. BASED ON THE US POPULATION OF ~328,000,000, THIS SUGGESTS BETWEEN 17.4 MILLION AND 19.0 MILLION AMERICANS ARE SEEKING AN ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL AT ANY GIVEN TIME.  MEANWHILE THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, IN AN APRIL 2011 NCHS DATA BRIEF, REPORTED THAT MORE THAN 50% OF THE POPULATION USES DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER. DETAILED FINDINGS FROM THAT REPORT INCLUDED.  \u00b7  USE OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS IS COMMON AMONG THE U.S. ADULT POPULATION. OVER 40% USED SUPPLEMENTS IN 1988\u20131994, AND OVER ONE-HALF IN 2003\u20132006.  \u00b7  MULTIVITAMINS/MULTIMINERALS ARE THE MOST COMMONLY USED DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS, WITH APPROXIMATELY 40% OF MEN AND WOMEN REPORTING USE DURING 2003\u20132006.  \u00b7  USE OF SUPPLEMENTAL CALCIUM INCREASED FROM 28% DURING 1988\u20131994 TO 61% DURING 2003\u20132006 AMONG WOMEN AGED 60 AND OVER.  STATUS OF OPERATIONS; CONSUMER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND SALES  MORE THAN 150 MILLION AMERICANS DRINK TEA EVERY DAY, AMOUNTING TO SOME 79 BILLION SERVINGS OF TEA IN AMERICA EVERY YEAR. OUR LAUNCH OF VIPOVATM TEA BRAND IS MEANT TO TAP INTO THIS EXISTING DEMAND. PART OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY IS TO BUILD NATIONAL BRANDS THROUGH PRODUCTS THAT LARGE GROUPS OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR AND COMFORTABLE WITH.  PAGE 28 OF 49  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  POVIVA TEA, LLC (NOW POVIVA CORP.). HAS FILED MULTIPLE PATENTS PENDING AND HAS RECEIVED SEVERAL GRANTED PATENTS TO BIND ACTIVE HEMP OIL INGREDIENTS WITH A LIPID, POTENTIALLY ALLOWING FOR MORE EFFICIENT AND COMFORTING DELIVERY OF THE CBD.  LEXARIA BEGAN PRODUCING CASH FLOWS FROM ITS PRODUCTS IN JANUARY 2015 FOCUSING ON THE IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HEMP-OIL-SECTORS THAT ARE FEDERALLY LEGAL. CANNABINOIDS HAVE BEEN FOUND BY MANY RESEARCHERS TO HAVE ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES AND LEXARIA PLANS TO USE THE PATENTED DEHYDRATECH PROCESS TO INFUSE HEMP OILS INTO A NUMBER OF POPULAR FOOD AND BEVERAGES.  LEXARIA HAS LAUNCHED A LINE OF PREMIUM PRODUCTS, ALWAYS RELYING ON OUR DEHYDRATECH PATENTED INFUSION PROCESS, TO BRING HEMP OIL INTO THE MAINSTREAM. BECAUSE HEMP OIL DOES NOT HAVE PSYCHOACTIVE PROPERTIES WE EXPECT OUR PRODUCTS TO APPEAL TO THE WIDEST POSSIBLE CUSTOMER BASE. TO DATE WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR SALES EFFORTS ACROSS THE CONTINENTAL USA. SOME STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT 3% OF THE CANADIAN POPULATION REGULARLY CONSUMES HEMP FOOD PRODUCTS, WHILE 1% OF THE AMERICAN POPULATION REGULARLY CONSUMES HEMP FOOD PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THE CONSUMPTION OF HEMP-BASED FOOD PRODUCTS OFFERS EXCEPTIONAL GROWTH POSSIBILITIES.  ACCORDING TO NUTRITION BUSINESS JOURNAL, THE ORGANIC FOOD SECTOR WAS A $246 BILLION INDUSTRY IN THE USA DURING 2014, WHILE DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS WAS A $34.6 BILLION INDUSTRY. ACCORDING TO ARCVIEW, LEGAL CANNABIS WAS A $4.7 BILLION US INDUSTRY IN 2015 AND EXPECTED TO GROW TO OVER A $20 BILLION SECTOR BEFORE 2025 BUT IS CLEARLY A MUCH SMALLER INDUSTRY SECTOR THAN THE MORE ESTABLISHED FOOD SECTORS. LEXARIA HAS NOT YET DETERMINED WHETHER OUR HEMP OIL-INFUSED PRODUCTS WILL BE ACCEPTED INTO ANY OR ALL THREE OF THESE PARTICULAR SECTORS.  LEXARIA HAS A MAIN CORPORATE WEBSITE (WWW.LEXARIABIOSCIENCE.COM) AS WELL AS SMALLER E-COMMERCE FOCUSED WEBSITES DEVOTED TO CONSUMER PRODUCTS. THE MAJORITY OF PRODUCT SALES HAVE TAKEN PLACE THROUGH THE E-COMMERCE WEBSITES. A CONTRACTED NATIONAL DISTRIBUTION CENTER ENSURES RAPID AND ACCURATE FULFILLMENT OF ALL ORDERS. A 1-800 ORDERING CENTER HAS ALSO BEEN PLACED INTO OPERATION.  ON JUNE 11, 2015, LEXARIA INITIATED THE SIMULTANEOUS FILING OF A U.S. UTILITY PATENT APPLICATION AND AN INTERNATIONAL PATENT APPLICATION UNDER THE PATENT COOPERATION TREATY (PCT) PROCEDURE, BOTH THROUGH THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (\u201cUSPTO\u201d). THESE APPLICATIONS FOLLOW THE COMPANY\u2019S 2014 AND 2015 FAMILY OF PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION FILINGS IN THE U.S. AND SERVE TWO ADDITIONAL BROAD PURPOSES.  1)  LEXARIA IS SEEKING PROTECTION OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY UNDER INTERNATIONAL TREATIES. TO THIS END LEXARIA HAS FILED FOR PCT PATENT APPLICATION PROTECTION. THERE ARE 148 COUNTRIES THAT ARE SIGNATORIES TO THE PATENT COOPERATION TREATY, INCLUDING SUCH MAJOR MARKETS AS CANADA, CHINA, INDIA, MUCH OF EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND JAPAN AMONG OTHERS.  2)  LEXARIA BELIEVES ITS LIPID INFUSION TECHNOLOGY HAS APPLICATIONS BEYOND THE DELIVERY OF JUST CANNABINOIDS. BASED ON FURTHER FORMULATION TESTING, LEXARIA HAS INCLUDED ADDITIONAL LIPOPHILIC MOLECULES THAT MAY BE DELIVERED VIA FOOD AND BEVERAGE FORMATS UTILIZING ITS TECHNOLOGY, WIDELY ENCOMPASSING THREE MAJOR NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COMPANY: NICOTINE; NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES (NSAIDS); AND VITAMINS.  IN DECEMBER 2015, THE COMPANY FILED TWO FURTHER PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATIONS IN THE U.S. THESE NEW APPLICATIONS SERVED TO FURTHER BROADEN THE VARIETY AND APPLICABILITY OF BASE COMPOUNDS THAT CAN BE USED WHEN FORMULATING THE COMPANY\u2019S LIPID BASED TECHNOLOGY. THE FIRST OF THESE APPLICATIONS IDENTIFY COMPOUNDS LIKE EDIBLE STARCHES (E.G., TAPIOCA STARCH) THAT ARE COMMONLY USED IN FOOD PRODUCTS TODAY AND COULD, THEREFORE, SERVE AS A BASE FOR FORMULATING AND INCORPORATING THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY INTO A WIDE VARIETY OF EVERY DAY FOOD PRODUCTS. THE SECOND OF THESE APPLICATIONS IDENTIFY EMULSIFIER COMPOUNDS LIKE GUM ARABIC THAT ARE COMMONLY USED IN BEVERAGE PRODUCTS TODAY IN ORDER TO FACILITATE SIMILAR FLEXIBILITY FOR FORMULATING THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY IN EVERY DAY, SHELF-STABLE BEVERAGES.  PAGE 29 OF 49  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON OCTOBER 26, 2016, THE USPTO ISSUED U.S PATENT NO. 9474725, CANNABINOID INFUSED FOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF, PERTAINING TO OUR METHOD OF IMPROVING BIOAVAILABILITY AND TASTE OF CERTAIN CANNABINOID LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS IN FOOD PRODUCTS. THIS IS THE COMPANY\u2019S FIRST PATENT GRANTED AND HAS A PUBLISH DATE OF OCTOBER 27, 2016 (JUNE 15 2017 IN AUSTRALIA NO. 2015274698) AND PROTECTS OUR TECHNOLOGY FOR TWENTY YEARS. ON DECEMBER 12, 2017, THE USPTO GRANTED PATENT NUMBER US 9,839,612 B2 FOR THE USE OF DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY AS A DELIVERY PLATFORM. ON MAY 22, 2018 PATENT US 9,974,739 B2, \u201cFOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS INFUSED WITH LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\u201d WAS GRANTED PROVIDING FOR \u201cCOMPOSITION OF MATTER\u201d CLAIMS THAT PROTECT THE SPECIFIC COMBINATION OF SUBSTANCES WHICH ENABLE IMPROVED TASTE AND BIOABSORPTION PROPERTIES OF ITS DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY FOR THE DELIVERY OF CANNABINOIDS. ON MAY 15, 2018 PATENT US 9,972,680 B2, \u201cFOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS INFUSED WITH LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\u201d WAS GRANTED PROVIDING CLAIMS THAT PROTECT PROCESSES FOR MAKING SPECIFIC COMPOSITIONS OF MATTER FOR ENHANCED CANNABINOID DELIVERY UTILIZING ITS DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY. ON AUGUST 31, 2018 AUSTRALIAN PATENTS 2017203054, 2018202562, AND 2018202583 WERE GRANTED. ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2018 THE USPTO GRANTED US 10,084,044 B2 AND ON OCTOBER16, 2018 US 10,103,225 B2 WITHIN THE SAME PATENT FAMILY.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT KNOW AND CANNOT KNOW WHETHER THESE STRATEGIES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL, OR IF SUCCESSFUL, HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO GAIN CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE AND CUSTOMER LOYALTY. IT CAN BE A CHALLENGE TO BE SUCCESSFUL BY INTRODUCING NEW CONSUMER PRODUCTS TO A COMPETITIVE RETAIL MARKETPLACE, AND WE CAN OFFER NO ASSURANCES THAT OUR PRODUCTS WILL BE A COMMERCIAL SUCCESS.  INTERNATIONAL PATENT PROTECTION  WHEN LEXARIA FIRST BEGAN EXAMINING THE LEGAL MEDICAL CANNABIS MARKET IN 2013, AND ENTERED THE MARKET IN 2014, THE COMPANY BELIEVED IT COULD MAKE AN IMPACT IN PERHAPS BOTH THE CANADIAN AND U.S. MARKETPLACES. OUR PURSUIT AND DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY HAS EXPANDED OUR POTENTIAL AREA OF IMPACT, BOTH GEOGRAPHICALLY AND BY SECTOR. BECAUSE OF THE APPLICABILITY OF OUR TECHNOLOGY TO MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE LEGAL CANNABIS SECTOR, WE HAVE TAKEN THE NECESSARY STEPS TO PROTECT THAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WITHIN LARGER GLOBAL MARKETS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY LIE WITHIN THE MEDICAL CANNABIS SECTOR OR IN OTHER UNRELATED SECTORS.  ADDITIONAL MOLECULES  NICOTINE.  MORE THAN 99% OF ALL NICOTINE THAT IS CONSUMED WORLDWIDE IS DELIVERED THROUGH SMOKING CIGARETTES. APPROXIMATELY 6,000,000 DEATHS PER YEAR, WORLDWIDE, ARE ATTRIBUTED PRIMARILY TO THE DELIVERY OF NICOTINE THROUGH THE ACT OF SMOKING ACCORDING TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, WHICH ALSO ESTIMATES THAT OVER $170 BILLION PER YEAR IS SPENT JUST IN THE USA ON DIRECT MEDICAL CARE COSTS FOR ADULT SMOKERS. 69% OF U.S. ADULT SMOKERS WANT TO QUIT SMOKING AND 43% OF US ADULT SMOKERS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO QUIT IN ANY TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD.  WORLDWIDE, RETAIL CIGARETTE SALES WERE WORTH $722 BILLION IN 2013, WITH OVER 5.7 TRILLION CIGARETTES SOLD TO MORE THAN 1 BILLION SMOKERS.  RELEVANCE  : LEXARIA POSTULATES THAT ENHANCED DELIVERY OF NICOTINE TO SATISFY CURRENT DEMAND, UTILIZING OUR PATENTED LIPID-DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY, IN NON-COMBUSTED, ORAL PRODUCT FORMATS, COULD SHIFT DEMAND AWAY FROM SMOKING CIGARETTES AND VAPING E-CIGARETTES. SINCE MOST OF THE ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF NICOTINE CONSUMPTION ARE ASSOCIATED WITH TODAY'S INHALED DELIVERY METHODS AND ONLY TO A LESSER DEGREE TO THE ACTUAL CONSUMPTION OF NICOTINE, THERE COULD BE A VAST POSITIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH OUTCOME THROUGH THE REDUCTION IN SMOKING AND VAPING TOBACCO PRODUCTS. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND REGULATORY COMPLIANT INVESTIGATIONS WOULD NEED TO BE CONDUCTED BEFORE OTHERWISE HEALTHY ORAL PRODUCT FORMATS CONTAINING DEHYDRATECH-ENABLED NICOTINE COULD BE INTRODUCED. NICOTINE IS A NAMED MOLECULE IN THE LATEST LEXARIA PATENT APPLICATIONS.  NSAID  . NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES ARE THE SECOND-LARGEST CATEGORY OF PAIN MANAGEMENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN THE WORLD. THE GLOBAL PAIN MANAGEMENT MARKET WAS ESTIMATED AT $22 BILLION IN 2011, WITH $5.4 BILLION OF THIS MARKET BEING SERVED BY NSAID\u2019S. THE U.S. MAKES UP OVER ONE-HALF OF THE GLOBAL MARKET. THE OPIOIDS MARKET (SUCH AS MORPHINE) FORM THE LARGEST SINGLE PAIN MANAGEMENT SECTOR BUT ARE KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SERIOUS DEPENDENCE AND TOLERANCE ISSUES.  SOME OF THE MOST COMMONLY KNOWN NSAIDS ARE ASA (ASPIRIN), IBUPROFEN (ADVIL, MOTRIN), AND ACETAMINOPHEN (TYLENOL - ACETAMINOPHEN IS NOT ACCEPTED BY ALL PERSONS TO BE AN NSAID). ALTHOUGH NSAIDS ARE GENERALLY A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT METHOD FOR PAIN, THEY HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH A NUMBER OF GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS INCLUDING DYSPEPSIA AND GASTRIC BLEEDING.  PAGE 30 OF 49  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RELEVANCE  : LEXARIA POSTULATES THAT DELIVERY OF NSAIDS THROUGH A LIPID-BASED MECHANISM COULD PROVIDE THE BENEFICIAL PROPERTIES OF PAIN RELIEF WITH LESSENED NEGATIVE GASTROINTESTINAL EFFECTS, AND ALSO POTENTIALLY DELIVER LOWER DOSAGES OF ACTIVE INGREDIENTS WITH SIMILAR PAIN MANAGEMENT OUTCOMES AS CURRENT PILL FORMS AT HIGHER DOSAGES. ASA, PIROXICAM, DICLOFENAC, INDOMETHACIN, IBUPROFEN, AND ACETAMINOPHEN ARE ALL NAMED MOLECULES IN THE LATEST LEXARIA PATENT APPLICATIONS.  VITAMINS.  THE GLOBAL VITAMIN AND SUPPLEMENT MARKET IS WORTH $68 BILLION ACCORDING TO EUROMONITOR. THE CATEGORY IS BOTH BROAD AND DEEP, COMPRISED OF MANY POPULAR AND SOME LESSER KNOWN SUBSTANCES. VITAMINS IN GENERAL ARE THOUGHT TO BE AN $8.5 BILLION ANNUAL MARKET IN THE U.S. THE U.S. IS THE LARGEST SINGLE NATIONAL MARKET IN THE WORLD, AND CHINA AND JAPAN ARE THE 2  ND  AND 3  RD  LARGEST VITAMIN MARKETS.  VITAMIN E IS FAT SOLUBLE AND CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO CELL MEMBRANES WHICH CAN PROTECT THEM FROM OXIDATIVE DAMAGE. GLOBAL CONSUMPTION OF NATURAL SOURCE VITAMIN E WAS 10,900 METRIC TONS IN 2013 WORTH $611.9 MILLION.  RELEVANCE  : LEXARIA POSTULATES THAT DELIVERY OF FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS THROUGH ITS PATENTED LIPID-BASED DELIVERY MECHANISM MAY RESULT IN LESS WASTE AND LOWER DOSAGES REQUIRED THAN MOST CURRENT PILL FORMS. AS WELL, INGESTION OF PILLS IS AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE FOR MANY PEOPLE SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT VITAMIN DELIVERY THROUGH COMMON FOOD GROUPS COULD VASTLY EXPAND MARKET DEMAND FOR THIS SECTOR. VITAMIN E IS A NAMED MOLECULE IN THE LATEST LEXARIA PATENT APPLICATIONS.  ON AUGUST 11, 2015, LEXARIA SIGNED A LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH POVIVA TEA LLC FOR $10,000, GRANTING LEXARIA A 35-YEAR NON EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE LICENSE TO UNENCUMBERED USE OF POVIVA TEA LLC\u2019S IP RIGHTS, INCLUDING RIGHTS OF RESALE. THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ENSURES LEXARIA HAS FULL ACCESS TO THE UNDERLYING INFUSION TECHNOLOGY. ON JANUARY 14, 2019 THIS AGREEMENT WAS UPDATED WHEREBY POVIVA CORP. GRANTED LEXARIA AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO THE DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGIES LASTING THE LATER OF 25 YEARS OF THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE LAST OF POVIVA CORP.\u2019S GRANTED PATENTS.  SCIENTIFIC TESTING AND VALIDATION  ON AUGUST 24, 2015, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED POTENTIAL INDUSTRY-CHANGING ACHIEVEMENTS IN ENHANCED GASTRO-INTESTINAL ABSORPTION OF CANNABIDIOL (CBD) UTILIZING LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY. THE THIRD-PARTY TESTING WAS CONDUCTED IN TWO PHASES OF  IN VITRO  TESTS BEGINNING IN JUNE AND COMPLETED IN AUGUST, 2015.  THE INDEPENDENT LABORATORY RESULTS DELIVERED AVERAGE CBD PERMEABILITY OF 499% OF BASELINE PERMEABILITY, COMPARED TO CBD PERMEABILITY WITHOUT LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY. THESE RESULTS EXCEED COMPANY EXPECTATIONS. THIS WAS ASSESSED IN A STRICTLY CONTROLLED,  IN VITRO  EXPERIMENT USING A HUMAN INTESTINAL TISSUE MODEL. SAMPLES OF LEXARIA\u2019S COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CBD-FORTIFIED VIPOVATM BLACK TEA WERE ADMINISTERED IN THE MODEL COMPARED WITH CONCENTRATION-MATCHED CBD CONTROL PREPARATIONS THAT LACKED LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED FORMULATION AND PROCESS ENHANCEMENTS. LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT ITS  IN VITRO  FINDINGS PROVIDE COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF THE INTESTINAL ABSORPTION ENHANCING CAPABILITIES OF ITS TECHNOLOGY, BASED ON WHICH IT IS EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES TO PROGRESS TO MORE ADVANCED, FOLLOW-ON BIOAVAILABILITY TESTING IN ANIMALS.  THE TESTS ALSO SHOWED 325% OF BASELINE GASTRO-INTESTINAL PERMEABILITY OF CBD COMPARING LEXARIA\u2019S CBD-FORTIFIED VIPOVATM BLACK TEA TO A SECOND CONTROL OF CBD AND BLACK TEA COMBINED,  WITHOUT  LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED FORMULATION ENHANCEMENTS. THIS CONFIRMED THAT THE SPECIALIZED PROCESSING UNDERTAKEN BY LEXARIA DURING ITS MANUFACTURING PROCESS TOGETHER WITH ITS FORMULATION ENHANCEMENTS, DOES INDEED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE ABSORPTION LEVELS.  THE BIOAVAILABILITY OF CBD (OR OF THC) VARIES GREATLY BY DELIVERY METHOD. SMOKING TYPICALLY DELIVERS CANNABINOIDS AT AN AVERAGE BIOAVAILABILITY RATE OF 30% (HUESTIS (2007) CHEM. BIODIVERS. 4:1770\u20131804; MCGILVERAY (2005) PAIN RES. MANAG. 10 SUPPL. A:15A \u2013 22A). BY COMPARISON, ORALLY CONSUMED CANNABIS EDIBLES TYPICALLY DELIVER CANNABINOIDS AT AN AVERAGE BIOAVAILABILITY RATE OF ONLY 5% (KARSCHNER ET AL. (2011) CLIN. CHEM. 57:66\u201375).  PAGE 31 OF 49  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY\u2019S PRESENT FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ITS TECHNOLOGY MAY ACHIEVE A 5-FOLD IMPROVEMENT IN CANNABINOID ABSORPTION IN EDIBLE FORM OVER THAT WHICH CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT ITS PROPRIETARY PROCESS AND FORMULATION ENHANCEMENTS. THIS CONCEPTUALLY SUPPORTS THAT LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGH IN CANNABINOID DELIVERY BY APPROXIMATING THE HIGH ABSORPTION LEVELS ACHIEVED AS THOUGH THROUGH ADMINISTRATION BY SMOKING, BUT WITHOUT THE ASSOCIATED NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH CAUSED BY SMOKING.  THE TESTS WERE COMPLETED IN TWO PHASES CULMINATING WITH TESTING USING SIMULATED INTESTINAL FLUID CONDITIONS THAT DELIVERED THESE FINDINGS. THESE RESULTS WERE STRONGER THAN EARLIER ITERATIONS OF THE TESTS THAT DID NOT USE A SIMULATED INTESTINAL FLUID ENVIRONMENT AND CONTRIBUTED TO LEXARIA\u2019S UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS AT WORK. FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS, LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT BIOAVAILABILITY TESTING IN ANIMALS IS LIKELY TO YIELD EVEN STRONGER ABSORPTION RESULTS IN THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL INTESTINAL FLUID CONDITIONS.  CBD HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY FOUND TO PROVIDE BENEFICIAL PAIN RELIEVING, ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, ANTI-ANXIETY, NEUROPROTECTION, ANTI-PSYCHOTIC, AND ANTI-CONVULSIVE EFFECTS AMONG OTHERS. LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED TECHNOLOGY COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE INDIVIDUAL SERVING REQUIREMENTS FOR CBD TO CONSUMERS. THIS COULD LEAD TO REDUCED COSTS OF CONSUMPTION FOR CONSUMERS AND INCREASED PROFITABILITY FOR LEXARIA.  LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT THE SAME TECHNOLOGY USED TO ENHANCE THE ABSORPTION OF CBD IN THE RECENT LABORATORY TESTS, IS APPLICABLE TO THC, NICOTINE, NSAIDS AND OTHER LIPOPHILIC COMPOUNDS THAT ARE WIDELY USED TODAY.  DURING JANUARY 2015, LEXARIA CONDUCTED A STUDY OF NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS IN HUMANS, AS A BIOMARKER FOR ABSORPTION OF CANNABIDIOL, WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE OF THE EFFICIENT ABSORPTION OF CANNABIDIOL FROM LEXARIA FOOD PRODUCTS ENHANCED WITH HEMP OIL, BY DEMONSTRATING THE ELEVATION OF NITRIC OXIDE IN THE HUMAN BODY IN RESPONSE TO PRODUCT INGESTION.  THE STUDY DATA FROM HUMAN SUBJECTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT ELEVATION OF SYSTEMIC NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS AS A SURROGATE BIOMARKER FOR CANNABIDIOL (CBD) BIOABSORPTION IN RESPONSE TO INGESTION OF LEXARIA'S PRODUCTS. THIS PROVIDED CLINICAL SUPPORT FOR THE CBD BIOAVAILABILITY ENHANCING PROPERTIES OF LEXARIA'S PATENTED TECHNOLOGY, ON THE PREMISE THAT BIOAVAILABLE CBD IS KNOWN TO ELEVATE LEVELS OF THE ENDOCANNABINOID ANANDAMIDE IN THE HUMAN BODY WHICH, IN TURN, STIMULATES RELEASE OF NITRIC OXIDE IN THE VASCULAR SYSTEM.  IN SUMMARY, CONSUMING LEXARIA AND VIPOVATM FOOD PRODUCTS RESULTED IN ELEVATED LEVELS OF NITRIC OXIDE WITHIN THE BODY. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY INDICATED THAT ALL LEXARIA AND VIPOVATM FOOD PRODUCTS ELICITED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SALIVARY NITRIC OXIDE, ACHIEVING LEVELS FROM 110 \u039cM TO AS HIGH AS 220 \u039cM IN THE TEST SUBJECTS. THE BEVERAGE PRODUCTS GENERALLY HAD FASTER INITIAL RESPONSES IN AS LITTLE AS 15 MINUTES AFTER PRODUCT INGESTION, WHEREAS THE INITIAL RESPONSES FROM THE PROTEIN-ENERGY BARS REQUIRED 30 MINUTES. THE FASTER RESPONSE TIME WITH THE BEVERAGE PRODUCTS WAS TO BE EXPECTED, GIVEN THE RELATIVE EASE OF DIGESTING LIQUIDS VERSUS SOLIDS. ALL PRODUCTS SUSTAINED THEIR MAXIMUM LEVELS OF NITRIC OXIDE DETECTION THROUGH TO THE 60-MINUTE END-POINTS USED IN THE STUDY, INDICATING A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL STUDY TO DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS REMAIN ELEVATED FOLLOWING PRODUCTION CONSUMPTION.  THE STUDY ASSESSED SIX FLAVORS OF VIPOVATM TEA (YUNAN BLACK, HERBAL CHERRY BLACK, EARL GREY, HERBAL BENGAL CHAI, HERBAL MASALA CHAI AND DECAF ENGLISH BREAKFAST), VIPOVATM COLUMBIAN SUPREMO COFFEE, VIPOVATM HOT CHOCOLATE AND LEXARIA ENERGY FOODS\u2019 CHOCOLATE BERRY DATE AND CASHEW BERRY DATE PROTEIN-ENERGY BARS.  SIX HEALTHY HUMAN SUBJECTS (3 MALE AND 3 FEMALE) BETWEEN THE AGES OF 22 AND 65 YEARS OF AGE WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY. SUBJECTS WERE SCREENED FOR CARDIOVASCULAR AND ALLERGIC RESPONSE TO HEMP PRODUCTS, WERE NON-SMOKERS AND DID NOT HAVE ANY HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE OR ALCOHOL ABUSE. ONE PRODUCT WAS STUDIED PER DAY ACROSS ALL SIX SUBJECTS, WITH EACH SUBJECT CONSUMING A FULL PRODUCT SERVING SIZE. SUBJECTS WERE REQUIRED TO REFRAIN FROM EATING FOOD OR USING VAPE PRODUCTS FOR AT LEAST 12 HOURS BEFORE TEST ARTICLE ADMINISTRATION ON EACH DAY OF THE STUDY. NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS IN THE TEST SUBJECTS WERE ASSESSED USING A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE, COLORIMETRIC TEST KIT DESIGNED TO QUANTIFY SYSTEMIC NITRIC OXIDE VIA A DETECTABLE SALIVARY MARKER. IMMEDIATELY BEFORE TEST ARTICLE ADMINISTRATION EACH DAY, ALL SUBJECTS WERE REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE A NEGATIVE BASELINE NITRIC OXIDE SALIVA TEST. SUBJECTS WERE CONSIDERED TO HAVE A NEGATIVE TEST STRIP READING AT A LEVEL OF 20 \u039cM ACCORDING TO THE TEST STRIP SCALE, AND POSITIVE READINGS ANYWHERE ABOVE THIS. SUBJECTS PERFORMED SALIVARY NITRIC OXIDE TESTING AT 15, 30, 45 AND 60 MINUTES\u2019 POST-CONSUMPTION OF EACH PRODUCT. ALL SUBJECTS REMAINED SEDENTARY FROM BASELINE THROUGH TO THE COMPLETION OF TESTING FOR EACH PRODUCT.  IN AUGUST OF 2018 WE RELEASED RESULTS FROM OUR TURBOCBDTM CAPSULES IN A RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, DOUBLE-BLIND EUROPEAN HUMAN CLINICAL STUDY THAT EVALUATED TURBOCBDTM - A PROPRIETARY, DEHYDRATECHTM POWERED, CANNABIDIOL (\u201cCBD\u201d) FORTIFIED HEMP OIL CAPSULE DEVELOPED BY LEXARIA. THE DEGREE AND SPEED OF CBD ABSORPTION INTO BLOOD PLASMA AND POTENTIAL CARDIOVASCULAR AND COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT IN 12 HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS WERE STUDIED.  PAGE 32 OF 49  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  KEY BIOAVAILABILITY DATA HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE STUDY COMPARING THE 90 MG DOSE OF LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM TO A 90 MG DOSE OF A POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION WITHOUT LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY WERE AS FOLLOWS.  \u00b7  30 MINUTES: CBD DELIVERED FROM LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES WAS ABSORBED MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN FROM THE POSITIVE CONTROL, DELIVERING 317% MORE CBD TO BLOOD AT THE 30-MINUTE MARK OF THE STUDY (I.E., 18.4 NG/ML COMPARED TO ONLY 4.4 NG/ML ON AVERAGE RESPECTIVELY [95% CI; P=0.051]);  \u00b7  60 MINUTES: THE TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES WENT ON TO DELIVER MORE CBD TO THE BLOOD AT THE 60-MINUTE MARK (I.E., 38.8 NG/ML) THAN THE POSITIVE CONTROL CAPSULES WERE ABLE TO REACH AT ANY TIME DURING THE 6-HOUR STUDY, FURTHER DEMONSTRATING THE EXCEPTIONAL RAPIDITY OF ACTION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TURBOCBDTM CAPSULES;  \u00b7  90 MINUTES: THE TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES FURTHER WENT ON TO DELIVER SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CBD TO THE BLOOD (86% MORE) THAN THE POSITIVE CONTROL CAPSULES AT THE 90-MINUTE MARK (I.E., 53.0 NG/ML COMPARED TO ONLY 28.4 NG/ML RESPECTIVELY [95% CI; P=0.034]);  \u00b7  THROUGH TO STUDY COMPLETION: LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES CONTINUED TO DELIVER MORE CBD TO BLOOD THAN THE POSITIVE CONTROL CAPSULES AT EACH SUBSEQUENT TIME POINT IN THE STUDY THROUGH TO THE 6-HOUR MARK WHEN THE STUDY WAS COMPLETED.  ADDITIONAL STUDY ANALYSIS WAS RELEASED IN FEBRUARY 2019.  KEY METABOLIC AND HEMODYNAMIC PERFORMANCE FINDINGS LINKED TO BIOAVAILABILITY ENHANCEMENTS WERE REVEALED IN THE STUDY, WHICH COMPARED A 90 MG DOSE OF LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM TO A 90 MG DOSE WITHOUT LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY (THE \u201cPOSITIVE CONTROL\u201d) AS WELL AS A PLACEBO, AS FOLLOWS.  \u00b7  ANALYSIS OF MEAN ARTERIAL BLOOD PRESSURE (MAP) AT PEAK BLOOD LEVELS OF CBD ACHIEVED WITH LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN MAP COMPARED TO PLACEBO (95% CI; P=0.027). THIS FINDING WAS NOT OBSERVED WITH THE DOSE-MATCHED POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION FOR WHICH THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN MAP COMPARED TO PLACEBO (95% CI; P=0.625);  \u00b7  CEREBRAL PERFUSION WAS ALSO ANALYSED BY AN INDEX OF CONDUCTANCE IN THE MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY (MCA). THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM CAUSED THE GREATEST INCREASE IN MCA CONDUCTANCE RELATIVE TO BOTH THE POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION AND PLACEBO (95% CI; P=0.017 AND P=0.002 RESPECTIVELY);  FINALLY, OVER THE SIX-HOUR STUDY, ANALYSIS OF THE TOTAL AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) DEMONSTRATED THAT LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM RESULTED IN A NOTABLE TREND FOR HIGHER LEVELS OF CBD IN THE BLOODSTREAM OVERALL THAN THE POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION WITH TOTAL AUC OF 10,865 \u00b1 6,322 OBSERVED WITH LEXARIA\u2019S FORMULATION COMPARED TO 7,115 \u00b1 2,978 OBSERVED WITH THE POSITIVE CONTROL (95% CI; P=0.096). FURTHERMORE, WHEN NORMALIZED TO BODY MASS, THE AUC AT THE PEAK CBD CONCENTRATION WAS MARKEDLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY (95% CI; P=0.02) HIGHER WITH THE TURBOCBDTM 90 MG DOSE COMPARED TO THE 90 MG DOSE POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION.  THESE RESULTS CORROBORATE AND CONFIRM OTHER IN VITRO AND IN VIVO STUDIES THAT HAVE EVALUATED LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY. ALTHOUGH THIS STUDY EVALUATED ABSORPTION ONLY OF CBD AND ITS METABOLITES, LEXARIA BELIEVES NEARLY IDENTICAL BIOAVAILABILITY ENHANCEMENT RESULTS WOULD BE ACHIEVED WITH OTHER CANNABINOIDS.  DURING MARCH OF 2019 WE ALSO LAUNCHED AN IN VIVO RESEARCH PROGRAM TO TEST LEXARIA DESIGNED NANOTECH ENHANCEMENTS COMPRISED OF ELEVEN SEPARATE ANIMAL STUDIES AND RELEASED INITIAL RESULTS DURING MAY 2019 DEMONSTRATING MEASURABLE QUANTITIES OF CANNABIDIOL INTO BLOOD IN AS LITTLE AS 2 MINUTES. IN EACH ARM OF THE ANIMAL STUDIES, 10 MALE SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS WERE ADMINISTERED CBD AT 25MG PER KG OF BODYWEIGHT. DELIVERY OF CBD INTO THE BLOODSTREAM WAS MONITORED OVER A 60-MINUTE DURATION. IN THE FIRST ANIMAL STUDY RESULTS, LEXARIA COMPARED ITS STANDARD DEHYDRATECH FORMULATION THAT COMBINES CANNABINOIDS WITH LONG-CHAIN FATTY ACIDS (\u201cLCFA\u201d) USING LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATION PROCESSING TECHNIQUE TO A CONCENTRATION-MATCHED FORMULATION UTILIZING COCONUT OIL WHICH IS A COMMONLY USED MEDIUM CHAIN TRIGLYCERIDE (\u201cMCT\u201d) OIL IN THE CANNABIS EDIBLES INDUSTRY.  PAGE 33 OF 49  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u00b7  AT 2 MINUTES DEHYDRATECH\u2019S LCFA FORMULATION DELIVERED MEASURABLE CBD IN BLOOD, COMPARED TO NO MEASURABLE CBD IN BLOOD UNTIL 6 MINUTES AND ONWARDS FOR THE MCT OIL FORMULATION.  \u00b7  AT 15 MINUTES DEHYDRATECH\u2019S LCFA FORMULATION ACHIEVED A CBD BLOOD CONCENTRATION LEVEL THAT WAS 475% MORE THAN THE MCT OIL FORMULATION; AND, THE DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION CBD BLOOD LEVELS REACHED AT 15 MINUTES WERE GREATER THAN THE CBD BLOOD LEVELS REACHED BY THE MCT OIL FORMULATION AT ANY TIME POINT DURING THE 60-MINUTE EVALUATION.  \u00b7  AT 60 MINUTES DEHYDRATECH\u2019S LCFA FORMULATION ACHIEVED A CBD BLOOD CONCENTRATION LEVEL OF 319% MORE THAN THE MCT OIL FORMULATION.  \u00b7  OVER THE ENTIRE 60-MINUTE STUDY, THE ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED THE STANDARD DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE MAXIMUM CBD BLOOD CONCENTRATION LEVEL THAT WAS 334% MORE THAN THE AVERAGE MAXIMUM BLOOD CONCENTRATION LEVEL OF THE ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED THE MCT OIL FORMULATION (P<0.0021).  \u00b7  OVER THE ENTIRE 60-MINUTE STUDY, THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC) (TOTAL QUANTITY OF CBD DELIVERED) FOR THE LEXARIA DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION WAS 389% MORE THAN THE MCT OIL FORMULATION (P<0.0011).  LEXARIA ALSO TESTED FOR BRAIN TISSUE CONCENTRATIONS TO QUANTIFY 8-HOUR CBD DELIVERY FROM THE DEHYDRATECH-ENABLED LCFA FORMULATION COMPARED TO THE MCT OIL FORMULATION AND DEHYDRATECH\u2019S LCFA FORMULATION OUTPERFORMED THE MCT OIL FORMULATION BY 246%.  THE COMPANY RELEASED ADDITIONAL RESULTS FROM ITS MARCH 2019 RESEARCH PROGRAM WHEREIN ANIMAL TESTING PROVED THAT COMBINING LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY WITH GENERIC NANOTECH TECHNIQUES DELIVERS 1,137% MORE CANNABIDIOL INTO ANIMAL BRAIN TISSUE FOLLOWING ORAL INGESTION THAN CERTAIN EXISTING INDUSTRY FORMULATIONS. LEXARIA COMBINED ITS DEHYDRATECH DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY WITH A STANDARD FORM OF NANOTECHNOLOGY AND ANALYZED SUBSEQUENT DELIVERY INTO BRAIN TISSUE FOLLOWING ORAL INGESTION. DELIVERY OF CBD INTO THE BRAIN WAS REPORTED 8 HOURS AFTER DOSING.  \u00b7  THE LEXARIA DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION  WITHOUT  NANOTECH ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE BRAIN TISSUE ACCUMULATION LEVEL THAT WAS 246% HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE FOR THOSE ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED THE MCT OIL FORMULATION (P=0.0013).  \u00b7  THE LEXARIA DEHYDRATECH LCFA FORMULATION WITH NANOTECH ACHIEVED AN AVERAGE BRAIN TISSUE ACCUMULATION LEVEL THAT WAS 1,137% HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE FOR THOSE ANIMALS THAT RECEIVED THE MCT OIL FORMULATION (P=0.0178).  WE HAVE ALSO COMPLETED OUR FIRST STUDY EVALUATING DEHYDRATECH  TM  USED IN A TOPICAL CREAM FORMULATION FOR ABSORPTION OF CBD THROUGH HUMAN SKIN. RESULTS PROVED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN BOTH SPEED AND QUANTITY OF CBD ABSORPTION THROUGH SKIN WHEN COMPARED TO CONTROL FORMULATIONS. THE ABSORPTION STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON HUMAN SKIN AT A CALIFORNIA-BASED LABORATORY THAT SPECIALIZES IN FRANZ DIFFUSION CELL SKIN PERMEABILITY TESTING. LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY WAS USED TOGETHER WITH A SOPHISTICATED OIL-IN-WATER EMULSION FORMULATION DESIGN AND COMPARED TO A SERIES OF MATCHING OIL-IN-WATER EMULSION FORMULATIONS PREPARED WITH THE SAME CBD INPUTS, WITH AND WITHOUT THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY AND WITH AND WITHOUT TWO LEADING SKIN PENETRATION ENHANCERS CURRENTLY USED IN THE SKIN PRODUCTS INDUSTRY. SEVERAL FACTORS WERE MEASURED, INCLUDING THE TIME REQUIRED TO DETECT CBD SKIN PENETRATION AND QUANTITY, AND PEAK AMOUNTS OF CBD ABSORBED INTO AND THROUGH THE SKIN, AT MULTIPLE TESTING INTERVALS OVER A 48-HOUR DURATION.  LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  -ENABLED TOPICAL FORMULATION, ABSENT EITHER OF THE COMMERCIAL PENETRATION ENHANCERS, WAS THE FASTEST ACTING FOR ABSORPTION INTO THE EPIDERMIS, DERMIS OR THROUGH THE SKIN INTO THE SYSTEMIC FRACTION REPRESENTING PERMEATION INTO THE UNDERLYING CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  -ENABLED PRODUCT ALSO HAD NO ODOUR EVEN WITHOUT THE USE OF PERFUMES, CONTRARY TO OTHER CANNABINOID INDUSTRY PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE QUITE STRONGLY ODORIFEROUS WITHOUT THE USE OF MASKING PERFUMES.  PAGE 34 OF 49  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FURTHERMORE, LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  -ENABLED TOPICAL FORMULATION WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF EITHER OF THE COMMERCIAL PENETRATION ENHANCERS, DEMONSTRATED THE HIGHEST OVERALL AVERAGE QUANTITY OF CBD DELIVERED THROUGH THE SKIN AND INTO THE REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEMIC FRACTION OF ALL THE FORMULATIONS TESTED, WITH AS MUCH AS A 225% INCREASE IN CBD PERMEABILITY WHEN COMPARED TO THE HIGHEST PERFORMING COMMERCIAL PENETRATION ENHANCER FORMULATION ASSESSED AND ALMOST A 1,900% INCREASE IN CBD PERMEABILITY WHEN COMPARED TO A CONTROL FORMULATION THAT WAS DEVOID OF BOTH THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY OR ANY COMMERCIAL PENETRATION ENHANCERS. THE COMMERCIAL SKIN PENETRATION ENHANCERS ONLY DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE THAT WAS ON PAR OR SUPERIOR TO THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  -ENABLED FORMULATIONS TESTED IN SO FAR AS TOTAL CBD ABSORPTION INTO THE SHALLOW EPIDERMIS OR DERMIS WAS CONCERNED.  WE HAVE ALSO COMPLETED OUR FIRST INGESTIBLE NICOTINE IN VIVO (ANIMAL) ABSORPTION STUDY. LEXARIA IS PURSUING THE USE OF ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY AS A POSSIBLE NEW NICOTINE DELIVERY METHOD, AN EDIBLE DOSE ABSORBED THROUGH THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT, WITH POTENTIAL BOTH AS A NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY AS WELL AS AN ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT FORMAT FOR REGULAR TOBACCO USERS.  DEHYDRATECH  TM  DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING MAJOR NICOTINE ABSORPTION PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS: 1,160% FASTER DELIVERY OF EQUIVALENT PEAK QUANTITIES OF NICOTINE TO THE BLOODSTREAM THAN ACHIEVED WITH CONTROLS (WITHIN 15 MIN VS. 2.9 HOURS), 148% GAIN IN THE QUANTITY OF PEAK NICOTINE DELIVERY TO THE BLOODSTREAM RELATIVE TO CONTROLS, 560% HIGHER BRAIN LEVELS OF NICOTINE WHERE NICOTINE EFFECTS ARE FOCUSED, COMPARED TO CONTROLS, LOWER URINE LEVELS OF NICOTINE EXCRETED THAN CONTROLS, FOR ENHANCED NICOTINE ACTIVITY AND BIOAVAILABILITY OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY, LOWER QUANTITIES OF KEY LIVER METABOLITES IN THE BLOODSTREAM THAN CONTROLS AS HYPOTHESIZED, SUGGESTING BYPASS OF FIRST PASS LIVER METABOLISM.  STUDY DESIGN PARAMETERS.  THE STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO PRINCIPALLY ASSESS THE RELATIVE INGESTIBLE NICOTINE ABSORPTION PERFORMANCE OF DEHYDRATECH  TM  -POWERED FORMULATIONS COMPARED TO CONCENTRATION-MATCHED CONTROL FORMULATIONS THAT LACKED ANY FORM OF DELIVERY ENABLING TECHNOLOGY IN RATS. NICOTINE WAS ADMINISTERED IN A NICOTINE POLACRILEX DERIVATIVE FORMAT AS IS WIDELY COMMERCIALIZED TODAY IN NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY PRODUCTS SUCH AS CHEWING GUMS. TWELVE MALE RATS WERE DIVIDED INTO FOUR GROUPS OF THREE, SUCH THAT DEHYDRATECH  TM  AND CONTROL FORMULATIONS WERE EACH TESTED AT A 1 MG/KG AND 10 MG/KG DOSAGE LEVEL. FORMULATIONS WERE ADMINISTERED ORALLY AND ALL RATS WERE CANNULATED FOR BLOOD COLLECTION AT MULTIPLE INTERVALS OVER AN 8 HOUR DURATION POST-DOSING WITH THE FIRST DATA COLLECTION AT THE 15-MINUTE MARK. URINE AND FECES WERE ALSO COLLECTED FOR UP TO A 24-HOUR DURATION POST-DOSING, AND ESSENTIAL ORGAN TISSUE SAMPLES WERE ALSO COLLECTED FOR EXAMINATION AFTER THE STUDY. ALL SAMPLES WERE SUBJECTED TO ANALYTICAL TESTING IN ORDER TO QUANTIFY THE LEVELS OF NICOTINE THEREIN, AS WELL AS THE LEVELS OF THREE MAJOR LIVER METABOLITES THEREOF, HYDROXYCOTININE, NICOTINE N\u2019-OXIDE AND COTININE, IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE RELATIVE METABOLITE LEVELS ABSORBED BY THE DIFFERENT FORMULATIONS. LEXARIA\u2019S HYPOTHESIS WAS TESTED TO PROVE THAT ITS DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY WOULD INFLUENCE MORE RAPID AND COMPLETE INTESTINAL BIOABSORPTION OF NICOTINE LYMPHATICALLY WITH LESS METABOLIC DEGRADATION BY THE LIVER. ALL ANIMALS WERE ALSO ASSESSED FOR GENERAL TOLERABILITY OF THE ADMINISTERED FORMULATIONS. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT THE SAME INDEPENDENT LABORATORY IN PHILADELPHIA WHERE THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS INITIAL CANNABIDIOL ABSORPTION STUDY IN 2015.  RESULTS & OBSERVATIONS.  THE LEXARIA FORMULATIONS GENERALLY ACHIEVED FASTER ABSORPTION, HIGHER PEAK ABSORPTION AND HIGHER OVERALL QUANTITIES OF NICOTINE, ON AVERAGE, IN THE BLOOD THAN THE CONCENTRATION-MATCHED CONTROL FORMULATIONS AT BOTH THE 1MG AND 10 MG/KG DOSES TESTED. FURTHERMORE, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THERE WERE NO OBVIOUS SIGNS OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISTRESS SUCH AS VOMITING OR DIARRHEA INDICATING THAT THE ANIMALS APPEARED TO TOLERATE THE TREATMENT WELL.  NICOTINE BLOOD LEVELS WERE EVALUATED MULTIPLE TIMES OVER A PERIOD OF 8 HOURS AFTER DOSING. IN THE 10MG/KG DOSING ARM, THE CONTROL FORMULATION REQUIRED NEARLY 3 HOURS TO REACH SIMILAR LEVELS OF BLOOD ABSORPTION THAT THE LEXARIA FORMULATION REACHED IN ONLY 15 MINUTES. FURTHERMORE, THE LEXARIA FORMULATION WENT ON THEREAFTER TO DEMONSTRATE PEAK PLASMA LEVELS THAT WERE 148% OF THOSE ACHIEVED BY THE CONTROL FORMULATION. IF REPLICATED IN HUMAN STUDIES, THESE FINDINGS ARE SUGGESTIVE THAT LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY COULD PROVE MORE EFFECTIVE IN ELEVATING BLOOD NICOTINE LEVELS THROUGH EDIBLE FORMATS MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND SUBSTANTIALLY THAN PREVIOUSLY THEORIZED, POTENTIALLY MAKING INGESTIBLE NICOTINE PREPARATIONS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO TODAY\u2019S AVAILABLE PRODUCT FORMATS WHILE ALSO LEADING TO A MORE RAPID NICOTINE CRAVING SATIATION.  PAGE 35 OF 49  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ANALYSIS OF THE LIVER METABOLITES REVEALED, AS EXPECTED, THAT OVERALL LEVELS IN THE BLOOD OF TWO OF THE THREE METABOLITES STUDIED WERE HIGHER IN THE CONTROL GROUP THAN IN THE LEXARIA FORMULATION GROUP AT THE 10 MG/KG DOSE. THIS RESULT WAS ESPECIALLY PRONOUNCED IN THE 45-MINUTE TO 2-HOUR TIME INTERVAL POST-DOSING WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPECTED TIMING OF RELEASE OF METABOLITES IN HIGHER QUANTITY INTO THE BLOODSTREAM BY THE LIVER FOLLOWING NORMAL PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSING OF INGESTED NICOTINE WITH THE CONTROL PREPARATION, COMPARED TO THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BELIEVED TO ELUDE FIRST PASS LIVER METABOLISM. THE LEXARIA FORMULATION ALSO DEMONSTRATED LOWER QUANTITIES OF NICOTINE IN THE RAT URINE AT BOTH DOSES, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FACT THAT THE LEVELS OF NICOTINE IN THE RAT BLOOD REMAINED HIGHER OVER THE DURATION OF THE STUDY WITH THE LEXARIA FORMULATION THAN WITH THE CONTROL. THE STUDY ALSO REVEALED THAT THE LEXARIA FORMULATION AT THE 10 MG/KG LEVEL ACHIEVED UP TO 5.6-TIMES AS MUCH NICOTINE UPON ANALYSIS OF THE RAT BRAIN TISSUE THAN WAS RECOVERED WITH THE MATCHING CONTROL FORMULATION. THESE FINDINGS TOGETHER PERHAPS SUGGEST PROLONGATION OF NICOTINE EFFECTIVENESS WITH THE LEXARIA FORMULATION WHICH MAY ALSO BE BENEFICIAL IN HUMANS TO CONTROL CRAVINGS OVER AN EXTENDED TIME-PERIOD FROM A SINGLE EDIBLE NICOTINE DOSE.  IN OUR FOLLOW-UP THIRD-PARTY  IN VIVO  STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT STUDY, INCLUDING TWO GROUPS OF 20 ANIMALS, FURTHER DEFINING DELIVERY OF NICOTINE IN EDIBLE FORM AT EACH OF THE 2, 4, 6, 8 AND 10-MINUTE INTERVALS POST-DOSING, WITH 90.2% GREATER DELIVERY THAN THE CONCENTRATION-MATCHED CONTROL FORMULATION BY THE 10-MINUTE MARK (95% CI; P=0.044), AND SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER ABSORPTION LEVELS THAN THE CONTROL FORMULATION AT ALL SUBSEQUENT TIME POINTS IN THE STUDY. SPEED OF ONSET IS A KEY ATTRIBUTE FOR ORAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND IT IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF NON-INHALATION NICOTINE DELIVERY FORMATS.  KEY HIGHLIGHTS OF THE FOLLOW-UP STUDY ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u00b7  PEAK LEVEL: 79% IMPROVEMENT IN PEAK BLOOD LEVELS (MAXIMUM CONCENTRATION OR \u201cCMAX\u201d) AT 394 NG/ML USING LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY VS. 220 NG/ML WITH THE CONTROL (95% CI; P=0.0257);  \u00b7  T  OTAL QUANTITY: 94% IMPROVEMENT IN TOTAL QUANTITY OF NICOTINE DELIVERED (AREA UNDER THE CURVE OR \u201cAUC\u201d) TO THE BLOOD DURING THE 60-MINUTE COURSE OF THE STUDY, AT 266 HR\u2022NG/ML VERSUS 137 HR\u2022NG/ML (95% CI; P=0.0086);  \u00b7  RAPIDITY: LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY DELIVERED NICOTINE INTO THE BLOOD STREAM BY THE FIRST TIME INTERVAL OF BLOOD SAMPLING AT THE 2-MINUTE MARK. ON AVERAGE, LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY DELIVERED 203 NG/ML TO THE BLOOD IN AGGREGATE OF THE 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 AND 15-MINUTE TIME POINTS, COMPARED TO ONLY 120 NG/ML IN AGGREGATE OVER THE SAME PERIOD BY THE CONTROL, AN IMPROVEMENT OF 70% (95% CI; P=0.0004).  IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE DESCRIBED SCIENTIFIC TESTING AND VALIDATION STUDIES, LEXARIA HAS ALSO CONDUCTED VARIOUS CANNABINOID FORMULATION EXPERIMENTS, TOGETHER WITH POTENTIAL DEHYDRATECHTM LICENSEE PARTNERS, ON CHOCOLATES, CANDIES, GUMMIES, MOUTH-MELTS, CHOCOLATE BARS, PROTEIN BARS, BEVERAGES SUCH AS BEER, SPICES, TEA, COFFEE, SUPPLEMENTS AND MORE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. BEVERAGE FORMULATIONS HAVE PRODUCED CANNABINOID WATER-BASED PRODUCTS INCLUDING DE-ALCOHOLIZED BEER THAT MASK UNWANTED CANNABIS FLAVOR AND ARE FAST ACTING. CHOCOLATE FORMULATIONS WERE REPORTED AS BEING THE FASTEST ACTING, MOST CONSISTENT, AND BEST-TASTING PRODUCTS RELATIVE TO COMPARATOR CONTROL FORMULATIONS IN APPROXIMATELY 70% OF CASES IN A RECENT 2017 CONSUMER STUDY. AS WELL, ON MARCH 22, 2016, LEXARIA ANNOUNCED RESULTS FROM ANOTHER CHOCOLATE FORMULATION CONSUMER STUDY IN WHICH TEST SUBJECTS RANKED THOSE CHOCOLATES THAT HAD BEEN CREATED WITH LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY AS THE BEST TASTING, MOST PALATABLE AND PROVIDING THE BEST OVERALL EXPERIENCE OF THE CHOCOLATES SAMPLED. FURTHERMORE, THE TEST SUBJECTS IN THAT STUDY INDICATED A TIME OF ONSET OF THE CANNABIS OIL EFFECTS IN AS LITTLE AS 15-20 MINUTES ON AVERAGE. THE STUDY INCLUDED 12 VOLUNTEERS WHO WERE ALL REGULAR CANNABIS CONSUMERS WITH EXPERIENCE INGESTING CONVENTIONAL EDIBLES. ALL CHOCOLATES USED IN THE STUDY WERE BLINDED (UNMARKED) IN ORDER THAT THE SUBJECTS COULD NOT DISCERN THE PRODUCT FORMULATIONS APPLIED.  PAGE 36 OF 49  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TECHNOLOGY OUT-LICENSING  ON MAY 14, 2016, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH NUKA ENTERPRISES, LLC (\u201cNUKA\u201d) FOR A TWO-YEAR PERIOD, TO UTILIZE THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE, TEST, MANUFACTURE, AND SELL MARIJUANA-INFUSED CONSUMABLE AND/OR TOPICAL PRODUCTS, IN THE STATE OF COLORADO, WITH AN OPTION OF EXTENDING THE TERMS OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT TO WASHINGTON, OREGON, AND CALIFORNIA. ON APRIL 30, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A NEW 10-YEAR RENEWAL LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH NUKA, MAKER OF 1906 BRAND CANNABIS CHOCOLATES AND OTHER EDIBLE PRODUCTS. THE NEW AGREEMENT PROVIDES NUKA WITH SEMI-EXCLUSIVE ABILITY TO UTILIZE THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY ACROSS THE US. NUKA ALSO ACQUIRED AN OPTION TO EXPAND ITS PRODUCTS AND BRAND TO CANADA, INCLUDING USING LEXARIA\u2019S EXISTING CHOCOLATE AND CONFECTIONS CONTRACT MANUFACTURER LICENSEE CANNFECTIONS GROUP INC. THE AGREEMENT INCORPORATES NEW RIGHTS IN PRODUCT CATEGORIES IN ADDITION TO THE ORIGINAL CHOCOLATE FORMATS, WHICH INCLUDE CANDIES, BEVERAGES, CAPSULES AND PILLS, AND TOPICAL CREAMS. ON MAY 21, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED A MAJOR EXPANSION IN OPERATIONS BY NUKA OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS INTO ILLINOIS, OHIO, MASSACHUSETTS, MICHIGAN AND OTHER STATES. THE COMPREHENSIVE SEMI-EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT PROVIDES NUKA AND 1906 WITH COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES UNTIL 2028. A SECOND LICENSE PROVIDES NUKA AND 1906 WITH THE IMMEDIATE ABILITY TO UTILIZE DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY FOR CBD ACROSS THE US MARKETPLACE.  ON JANUARY 25, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH A 7-YEAR TERM WITH CANNFECTIONS GROUP INC. WHEREBY LEXARIA IS PROVIDING ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY TO EMPOWER NEXT-GENERATION PERFORMANCE IN CANNABIS INFUSED CHOCOLATES AND CANDIES TO BE DEVELOPED AND SOLD IN CANADA AND INTERNATIONALLY.  ON FEBRUARY 26, 2018 THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT ENTERED AN AGREEMENT WITH NEUTRISCI INTERNATIONAL INC. (\"NEUTRISCI\") (TSX-V: NU, OTCQB: NRXCF) SUCH THAT NEUTRISCI NOW OWNS 100% OF AMBARII TRADE CORPORATION AND LEXARIA HAS GRANTED TO NEUTRISCI AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSE AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT FOR THE MANUFACTURING AND SALE OF CBD BASED PRODUCTS. THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN TERMINATED EFFECTIVE MARCH 15, 2019.  ON FEBRUARY 27, 2018 THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH LOS ANGELES-BASED, PRIVATELY-HELD BIOLOG, INC. (\u201cBIOLOG\u201d) FOR A 5-YEAR TERM WHEREBY LEXARIA PROVIDED ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY TO EMPOWER A UNIQUE SET OF NEXT-GENERATION FOOD AND BEVERAGE CANNABIS INFUSION PRODUCTS TO BE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES. ON JUNE 10, 2019 THE COMPANY TERMINATED ITS LICENSE WITH BIOLOG INC.  ON APRIL 25, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH GP HOLDINGS LLC, (\u201cGP\u201d) WHEREBY LEXARIA PROVIDED ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY FOR CANNABIS INFUSED BEVERAGES AND TOPICAL SKIN PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA. GP ACQUIRED A 5-YEAR SEMI-EXCLUSIVE RIGHT. SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR END, ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2018, THE COMPANY CANCELLED THE CONTRACT DUE TO ONGOING DELAYS AND NON-PERFORMANCE.  ON JULY 31, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED, AND HILL STREET BEVERAGE COMPANY INC., (TSXV:BEER; \u201cHILL STREET\u201d) JOINTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO LICENSE LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  , ON A SEMI-EXCLUSIVE BASIS, FOR A TERM OF FIVE (5) YEARS, TO PRODUCE A LINE OF CANNABIS-INFUSED ALCOHOL-FREE BEVERAGES FOR CANADIAN DISTRIBUTION, FOLLOWING REGULATORY APPROVAL.  ON JANUARY 15, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY LEXARIA NICOTINE LLC (\u201cLEXARIA NICOTINE\u201d) AND ALTRIA VENTURES INC., AN INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF ALTRIA GROUP, INC. (\u201cALTRIA\u201d), EXECUTED DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS TO PURSUE INNOVATION IN ORAL, REDUCED RISK NICOTINE CONSUMER PRODUCTS USING LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY. ALTRIA WAS GRANTED A LICENSE TO USE LEXARIA BIOSCIENCE\u2019S DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY FOR ORAL NICOTINE DELIVERY FORMS ON AN EXCLUSIVE BASIS IN THE UNITED STATES AND A NON-EXCLUSIVE BASIS ELSEWHERE GLOBALLY. ALTRIA WILL PAY LEXARIA NICOTINE A ROYALTY ON REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE SALE OF NICOTINE PRODUCTS CONTAINING DEHYDRATECH, UNTIL SUCH TIME IT MAY ACQUIRE 100% OWNERSHIP IN LEXARIA NICOTINE.  ON APRIL 24, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE 5-YEAR AGREEMENT, VIA ITS SUBSIDIARY LEXARIA CANPHARM ULC, TO PROVIDE LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY TO A PRIVATE CALIFORNIA-BASED COMPANY FOR ITS UTILIZATION IN CERTAIN CBD-BASED BEVERAGES TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA THAT MAY INCLUDE ANY COMBINATION OF READY-TO-DRINK BEVERAGES SUCH AS NON-ALCOHOLIC BEERS, WINES AND SPIRITS; COLD OR HOT COFFEE OR TEAS, SPORTS DRINKS AND MORE.  ON MAY 7, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE 5-YEAR AGREEMENT, VIA ITS SUBSIDIARY LEXARIA HEMP CORP., TO PROVIDE LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY TO A PRIVATE NEVADA-BASED COMPANY FOR ITS UTILIZATION IN CERTAIN CBD-BASED BEVERAGES TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD ACROSS THE USA THAT MAY INCLUDE ANY COMBINATION OF READY-TO-DRINK BEVERAGES SUCH AS NON-ALCOHOLIC BEERS, WINES AND SPIRITS; COLD OR HOT COFFEE OR TEAS, SPORTS DRINKS AND MORE.  PAGE 37 OF 49  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE CONTINUATION OF OUR BUSINESS INTERESTS IN THESE SECTORS IS DEPENDENT UPON OBTAINING FURTHER FINANCING, A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS OF DEVELOPMENT, AND, ULTIMATELY, ACHIEVING A PROFITABLE LEVEL OF OPERATIONS. THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES BY US COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT DILUTION IN THE EQUITY INTERESTS OF OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS. OBTAINING COMMERCIAL LOANS, ASSUMING THOSE LOANS WOULD BE AVAILABLE, WILL INCREASE OUR LIABILITIES AND FUTURE CASH COMMITMENTS.  WE ARE NOT YET PROFITABLE AND HAVE NOT YET DEMONSTRATED OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES FROM OUR BUSINESS PLAN. WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CORPORATE FUNDS IF OUR EXISTING CAPITAL IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY UNTIL POTENTIAL FUTURE PROFITABILITY IS REACHED. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FURTHER FUNDS REQUIRED FOR OUR LONG-TERM OPERATIONS. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL OPERATING CAPITAL DURING OUR FISCAL 2019 YEAR, BUT DO EXPECT TO REQUIRE CAPITAL IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH OUR OWN, FEDERALLY LICENSED CANADIAN LABORATORY ON-PREMISES FOR OUR INTERNAL R&D PURPOSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US WHEN NEEDED OR, IF AVAILABLE, THAT IT CAN BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN THE ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS AS PLANNED, AND WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET OUR OTHER LONGER-TERM OBLIGATIONS AS THEY BECOME DUE. IN SUCH EVENT, WE COULD BE FORCED TO SCALE DOWN OR PERHAPS EVEN CEASE OUR OPERATIONS. THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER WE CAN OBTAIN ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FINANCING IF WE DO IN FACT REQUIRE IT.  OUR BUSINESS PLAN ANTICIPATES THAT WE WILL HIRE THREE TO SIX EMPLOYEES AND INCLUDES NEW OFFICE SPACE THAT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN ORDER TO FACILITATE A FEDERALLY LICENSED CANADIAN LABORATORY ON-PREMISES FOR OUR INTERNAL R&D PURPOSES. AS AT MAY 31, 2019 OFFICE SPACES ARE PRIMARILY COMPLETE AND IN-USE, THE LABORATORY SPACE IS ALSO PRIMARILY COMPLETE WITH FINAL EQUIPMENT DESIGN AND ACQUISITION IN PROGRESS AND WE HAVE HIRED THREE EMPLOYEES WITH A FOURTH SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN THE LABORATORY SPACE DURING OUR FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER. WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE CONTRACTED THIRD PARTIES FOR MOST OF OUR PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION NEEDS, INSTEAD FOCUSING OUR CAPITAL ON HIGHER VALUE-ADDED ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS SUCH AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND SCIENTIFIC TESTING. WE HAVE NO CURRENT PLANS TO BUILD OUR OWN PRODUCTION FACILITY.  OUR COMPANY RELIES ON THE BUSINESS EXPERIENCE OF OUR EXISTING MANAGEMENT, ON THE TECHNICAL ABILITIES OF CONSULTING EXPERTS, AND ON THE TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL ABILITIES OF ITS OPERATING PARTNER COMPANIES TO EVALUATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.  COMPETITION  THE LEGAL MARIJUANA INDUSTRY IS COMPRISED OF SEVERAL SUB-SECTORS AND IS LEGAL UNDER DIFFERENT GUIDELINES IN MANY STATES THOUGH IT REMAINS ILLEGAL UNDER MOST FEDERAL LAWS. NOTWITHSTANDING, THE OVERALL SECTOR IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED TO BE ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING IN THE USA, WITH STATE-LEGAL REVENUE OF OVER $8 BILLION IN 2016. INDEPENDENT PROJECTIONS AND PUBLICIZED REPORTS EXPECT REVENUE OF $20 BILLION OR MORE IN 2020, BOTH AS THE SECTOR GAINS IN CREDIBILITY AND ACCEPTANCE, AND AS MORE AND MORE STATES LEGALIZE EITHER MEDICAL USE OR ADULT RECREATIONAL USE; OR BOTH. IN ANY FAST GROWING INDUSTRY, COMPETITION IS EXPECTED TO BE BOTH STRONG AND ALSO DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE AS TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE COMPETITIVE THREATS. WHILE WE ARE AN EARLY ADOPTER WITHIN THE CANNABINOID DELIVERY SECTOR, THERE ARE ALREADY REPORTS OF MORE THAN 300 PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT HAVE CLAIMED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE SECTOR IN SOME FASHION; AND AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF PRIVATE COMPANIES. OUR CURRENT STRATEGIES MAY PROVE TO BE INEFFECTIVE AS THE SECTOR GROWS AND MATURES, AND IF SO, WE WILL HAVE TO ADAPT QUICKLY TO CHANGING SECTORAL CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY INTENDS TO AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE TECHNOLOGY OUT-LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES NOT ONLY WITHIN THE CANNABINOIDS SECTOR WHERE IT IS ALREADY ACTIVE, BUT ALSO ACROSS OTHER SECTORS WHERE ITS DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY IS PATENT ALLOWED AND/OR PENDING, INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE VITAMIN AND SUPPLEMENTS SECTOR, THE PAIN RELIEF SECTOR AND THE NICOTINE PRODUCTS SECTOR.  COMPETITION IN ALTERNATIVE HEALTH SECTORS AND IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS IN THE USA IS FIERCE. WE EXPECT TO ENCOUNTER COMPETITIVE THREATS FROM EXISTING PARTICIPANTS IN THE SECTOR AND NEW ENTRANTS. ALTHOUGH POVIVA CORP. HAS FILED PATENT APPLICATIONS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT PATENTS BEYOND THOSE ALREADY ISSUED WILL BE GRANTED NOR THAT OTHER FIRMS MAY NOT FILE SUPERIOR PATENTS PENDING. FOOD SUPPLEMENTS, ORGANIC FOODS, AND HEALTH FOOD MARKETS ARE ALL WELL ESTABLISHED AND OUR COMPANY WILL FACE MANY CHALLENGES TRYING TO ENTER THESE MARKETS. LEXARIA IS ALSO AWARE OF VARIOUS COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES THAT EXIST IN THE MARKETPLACE THAT CLAIM TO ALSO ENHANCE THE BIOABSORPTION OF CANNABINOIDS AS LEXARIA HAS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH REPEATED  IN VITRO  AND  IN VIVO  SCIENTIFIC TESTING WITH ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY. BY AND LARGE, THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALL FORMS OF NANOTECHNOLOGY THAT GENERALLY CLAIM TO ENABLE THE FORMATION OF MICROENCAPSULATED MICROEMULSIONS OF CANNABINOID ACTIVE INGREDIENTS. THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN ENABLE EXCEPTIONAL WATER SOLUBILITY OF CANNABINOID INGREDIENTS AND CAN IMPART IMPROVED INTESTINAL BIOABSORPTION AS A RESULT.  PAGE 38 OF 49  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HOWEVER, IT IS LEXARIA\u2019S BELIEF THAT ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY OFFERS A HOST OF BENEFITS BEYOND WHAT COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES CAN OFFER, INCLUDING SUPERIOR ORAL PALATABILITY, A MORE APPEALING AND ALL-NATURAL INGREDIENT COMPOSITIONAL PROFILE FROM A FOOD AND BEVERAGE FORMULATION PERSPECTIVE AND SUPERIOR SCALABILITY AND COST EFFECTIVENESS FROM A MANUFACTURING PERSPECTIVE. LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT ITS DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY IS, THEREFORE, SIGNIFICANTLY DISTINGUISHED FROM COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES IN THESE RESPECTS, WITH A VIEW TO GROWING THE BREADTH AND NUMBER OF LICENSEES THAT WILL ADOPT ITS TECHNOLOGY FOR THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS GOING FORWARD. LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT THESE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES TOGETHER WITH ITS WEALTH OF SCIENTIFIC DATA SHOWING NOTEWORTHY BIOABSORPTION ENHANCEMENTS WITH ITS DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY CONSTITUTE A COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITION FOR ITS PROSPECTIVE LICENSEES, AND IT INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS NOT ONLY WITHIN THE CANNABINOIDS EDIBLES SECTOR WHERE IT IS ALREADY ACTIVE, BUT ALSO IN THE VARIOUS OTHER BIOACTIVE INGREDIENT SECTORS IDENTIFIED IN ITS ISSUED AND PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS.  COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION  OVER 30 STATES IN THE USA HAVE PASSED SOME FORM OF LEGISLATION RELATED TO THAT STATE\u2019S PERMISSION TO GROW, CULTIVATE, SELL OR USE MARIJUANA EITHER FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES OR FOR RECREATIONAL OR \u201cADULT USE\u201d PURPOSES; OR BOTH. THE VARIOUS STATE LEGISLATION IS NOT NECESSARILY HARMONIOUS WITH ONE ANOTHER, LEADING TO POTENTIAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN STATE LAWS. IT IS MOST OFTEN NOT LEGAL TO TRANSPORT CANNABIS-RELATED PRODUCTS ACROSS STATE LINES.  LEXARIA DOES NOT \u201cTOUCH THE PLANT\u201d IN ANY LOCATION WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF THE USA. WE COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW THAT PROVIDES FOR CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL (INDUSTRIAL) HEMP AND CERTAIN BYPRODUCTS TO BE MANUFACTURED AND SOLD IN THE US. THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY MAY HAVE APPLICATIONS WITHIN THE LEGAL MARIJUANA SECTOR AND WE MAY SEEK TO LICENSE THAT TECHNOLOGY TO COMPANIES THAT HAVE MET AND COMPLY WITH STATE REGULATIONS FOR THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION OF CANNABIS RELATED PRODUCTS IN ANY PARTICULAR JURISDICTION.  LEXARIA\u2019S POSITION IS THAT, JUST AS A TELEPHONE COMPANY PROVIDES COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, AND AN ELECTRIC COMPANY PROVIDES ELECTRICAL POWER, OUR PROVISION OF TECHNOLOGICAL SERVICES TO A STATE-LEGAL CANNABIS COMPANY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REQUIRED REGULATIONS.  LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY MAY ALSO HAVE APPLICATION IN COMPLETELY SEPARATE SECTORS SUCH AS VITAMINS, NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES, AND NICOTINE. WE HAVE NO PRODUCTS NOR OPERATIONS IN ANY OF THESE SECTORS TODAY, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE COMMENCED FORMULATION DEVELOPMENT FOR RESEARCH AND VALIDATION PURPOSES IN EACH OF THESE AREAS. IF WE ENTER ANY OF THESE SECTORS AT ANY TIME, WE WILL BE EXPOSED TO AND OF NECESSITY WILL HAVE TO COMPLY WITH, ALL LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN EACH OF THOSE SECTORS. AS A RESULT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF LEXARIA BEING INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF DISPARATE BUSINESS SECTORS, COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE FROM OUR COMPANY.  THE US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PASSED THE 2018 FARM BILL (THE \u201cBILL\u201d), IN DECEMBER OF 2018, THAT MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACTS ON INDUSTRY SEGMENTS THAT WE OPERATE AND HAVE PRODUCTS IN AND POTENTIALLY CHANGE SOME OF THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE RISKS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. THE BILL INCLUDES LIFTING RESTRICTIONS ON ADVERTISING, MARKETING, BANKING AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AS WELL AS ALLOWING INTERSTATE COMMERCE FOR HEMP AND HEMP-DERIVED CANNABIDIOL (CBD), REMOVE BARRIERS FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTIONS UNDER FEDERAL LAW SUCH AS PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS, AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER MEASURES THAT MAY POSITIVELY IMPACT THESE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS OVERALL. THE IMPACT THE BILL MAY HAVE ON OTHER REGULATORY BODIES AND THEIR REGULATIONS WILL REQUIRE ONGOING MONITORING TO DETERMINE THE OUTCOME AND TIMING OF ANY REVISIONS.  SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS  WE HAVE LEASED A NEW HEAD-OFFICE LOCATION IN KELOWNA, CANADA, THAT INCLUDED THE PURCHASE AND CONSTRUCTION OF OFFICE EQUIPMENT, FURNITURE, COMPUTERS, AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. WE ALSO CONSTRUCTED SPACE FOR A FEDERAL LICENSED CANADIAN LABORATORY ON-PREMISES FOR OUR INTERNAL R&D PURPOSES, FOR WHICH A LICENSE APPLICATION HAS BEEN FILED WITH HEALTH CANADA. COSTS INCURRED TO DATE ARE INCLUDED IN CAPITALIZED ASSETS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES.  PAGE 39 OF 49  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONTRACTORS  WE PRIMARILY USE SUB-CONTRACTORS AND CONSULTANTS IN THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSING, AND ALTERNATIVE HEALTH PRODUCT SECTORS.

WE ARE PLANNING AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PERSONNEL OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTH PERIOD TO ENHANCE CAPACITY AND, SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE LAB FACILITY, FOR R&D PURPOSES. WE DO AND WILL CONTINUE TO OUTSOURCE CONTRACT EMPLOYMENT AS NEEDED. ADDITIONAL CAPACITY MAY BE REQUIRED WITH PRODUCT ADVANCEMENT OR RETAIL ACCEPTANCE OF OUR NEW PRODUCTS, WE MAY NEED TO RETAIN ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL PARTICULARLY IN THE FIELDS OF PRODUCT MANUFACTURING, DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ACCURATELY PROJECT POTENTIAL NEEDS INTO THE FUTURE BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT OCCUR.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  LEXARIA INCURRED $394,091 (2018 $279,221) IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES DURING THE PERIOD ENDING MAY 31, 2019.  SPECIFIC R&D PROGRAMS ARE IN ONGOING DEVELOPMENT AND WILL BE TIGHTLY RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL ABILITY TO UNDERTAKE EACH RESEARCH PHASE FOR EACH MOLECULE. DUE TO OUR EXPANDING PORTFOLIO COVERAGE, WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXAMINE ACCELERATED TIMETABLE OPTIONS FOR TESTING, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S PLANS TO INCLUDE  IN VITRO  ABSORPTION TESTS OF OUR PATENTED TECHNOLOGY OF MOLECULES SUCH AS: VITAMIN E, IBUPROFEN, AND NICOTINE ALLOWED US TO PERFORM TESTING ON NICOTINE WITH POSITIVE RESULTS. OUR PLAN TO CONDUCT OUR FIRST EVER  IN VIVO  ABSORPTION TESTS ON CBD ALSO YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS. ONGOING TESTING PLANS ARE PROCEEDING TO FURTHER DEFINE MOLECULAR COMPATIBILITY, ABSORPTION RATES, TIMING AND VIABLE FORMATS OF DELIVERY.  THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY FOCUSES ON NEW R&D PROGRAMS TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS FOR ITS TECHNOLOGY. THESE INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, ONGOING PROGRAMS TO EXPLORE METHODS TO INTEGRATE NANOEMULSIFICATION CHEMISTRY TECHNIQUES TOGETHER WITH ITS TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS ONGOING PROGRAMS TO FURTHER ENHANCE INTESTINAL BIOABSORPTION RATES WITH ITS TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS ONGOING PROGRAMS TO EXPAND THE TYPES AND BREADTH OF PRODUCT FORM FACTORS INTO WHICH ITS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE APPLIED. DEPENDING ON HOW MANY OF THESE TESTS ARE UNDERTAKEN, R&D BUDGETS ARE EXPECTED TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY, TO DO SO. IT IS IN OUR BEST INTERESTS TO REMAIN FLEXIBLE AT THIS EARLY STAGE OF OUR R&D EFFORTS IN ORDER TO CAPITALIZE ON POTENTIAL NOVEL FINDINGS FROM EARLY-STAGE TESTS AND THUS RE-DIRECT RESEARCH INTO SPECIFIC AVENUES THAT OFFER THE MOST REWARD.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT ARE MATERIAL TO STOCKHOLDERS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED IN THE UNITED STATES. PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENT'S APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. WE BELIEVE THAT UNDERSTANDING THE BASIS AND NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED WITH THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS CRITICAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIALS.  CAPITAL ASSETS  CAPITAL ASSETS ARE STATED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES OR BY UNITS OF PRODUCTION.  PAGE 41 OF 49  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PATENTS  CAPITALIZED PATENT COSTS REPRESENT LEGAL COSTS INCURRED TO ESTABLISH PATENTS. WHEN PATENTS REACH A MATURE STAGE, ANY ASSOCIATED LEGAL COSTS ARE COMPRISED MOSTLY OF MAINTENANCE FEES AND ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. CAPITALIZED PATENT COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE PATENT.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  PRODUCT REVENUE  REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF ALTERNATIVE HEALTH PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS UPON SHIPMENT. THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS SALES NET OF THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL SALES RETURNS. SALES TAX COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS IS EXCLUDED FROM NET SALES.  LICENSING REVENUE FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR LICENSE FEES AT A POINT IN TIME FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OUR PATENTED LIPID NUTRIENT INFUSION TECHNOLOGY DEHYDRATECHTM FOR INFUSING ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS, TO THE LICENSEE, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS ON DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTATION.  USAGE FEES FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR USAGE FEES WHEN USAGE OF OUR DEHYDRATECHTM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OCCURS BY LICENSEES INFUSING AND ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT INTO ONE OR MORE OF THEIR PRODUCT LINES FOR SALE.  GOING CONCERN  WE HAVE SUFFERED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS. THE CONTINUATION OF OUR COMPANY AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR COMPANY ATTAINING AND MAINTAINING PROFITABLE OPERATIONS AND/OR RAISING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENT RELATING TO THE RECOVERY AND CLASSIFICATION OF RECORDED ASSET AMOUNTS OR THE AMOUNT AND CLASSIFICATION OF LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SHOULD OUR COMPANY DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS. THE RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS AND NET CAPITAL DEFICIENCY RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  IN JANUARY 2016, FASB ISSUED AN ASU, SUBTOPIC 82510, TO AMEND CERTAIN ASPECTS OF RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT, PRESENTATION, AND DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. MOST PROMINENT AMONG THE AMENDMENTS IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, TO BE RECOGNIZED THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS RATHER THAN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE STANDARD SEPTEMBER 1, 2018. THE IMPACT WAS NOT MATERIAL AND THE $14,247 IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WAS INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  IN FEBRUARY 2016 FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 201602, LEASES (TOPIC 842) WHICH SUPERSEDES FASB ASC TOPIC 840, LEASES (TOPIC 840) AND PROVIDES PRINCIPLES FOR THE RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT, PRESENTATION, AND DISCLOSURE OF LEASES FOR BOTH LESSEES AND THE LESSORS. THE NEW STANDARD REQUIRES THE LESSEES TO APPLY A DUAL APPROACH, CLASSIFYING LEASES AS EITHER FINANCE OR OPERATING LEASES BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF WHETHER OR NOT THE LEASE IS EFFECTIVELY A FINANCED PURCHASE BY THE LESSEE. THE CLASSIFICATION WILL DETERMINE WHETHER LEASE EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD OR ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE, RESPECTIVELY. A LESSEE IS ALSO REQUIRED TO RECORD A RIGHT OF USE ASSET AND A LEASE LIABILITY FOR ALL LEASES WITH A TERM OF GREATER THAN TWELVE MONTHS REGARDLESS OF CLASSIFICATION. LEASES WITH A TERM OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR SIMILAR TO EXISTING GUIDANCE FOR OPERATING LEASES. THE STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED UPON ISSUANCE. WHEN ADOPTED, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THIS GUIDANCE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  PAGE 42 OF 49  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW STANDARD TO REPLACE THE INCURRED LOSS IMPAIRMENT METHODOLOGY IN CURRENT U.S. GAAP WITH A METHODOLOGY THAT REFLECTS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF A BROADER RANGE OF REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE INFORMATION TO INFORM CREDIT LOSS CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES. FOR TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, LOANS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO USE A FORWARD LOOKING EXPECTED LOSS MODEL RATHER THAN THE INCURRED LOSS MODEL FOR RECOGNIZING CREDIT LOSSES WHICH REFLECTS LOSSES THAT ARE PROBABLE. CREDIT LOSSES RELATING TO AVAILABLE FOR SALE DEBT SECURITIES WILL ALSO BE RECORDED THROUGH AN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RATHER THAN AS A REDUCTION IN THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITIES. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR LEXARIA BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1, 2020, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. APPLICATION OF THE AMENDMENTS IS THROUGH A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO DEFICIT AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE STANDARD ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 201802, INCOME STATEMENT\u2013REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220): RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH ALLOWS A RECLASSIFICATION FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO RETAINED EARNINGS FOR STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ENACTED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON DECEMBER 22, 2017 (THE \u201c2017 TAX ACT\u201d). CONSEQUENTLY, THE AMENDMENTS ELIMINATE THE STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE 2017 TAX ACT AND WILL IMPROVE THE USEFULNESS OF INFORMATION REPORTED TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT USERS. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL ENTITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED, INCLUDING ADOPTION IN ANY INTERIM PERIOD, (1) FOR PUBLIC BUSINESS ENTITIES FOR REPORTING PERIODS FOR WHICH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN ISSUED AND (2) FOR ALL OTHER ENTITIES FOR REPORTING PERIODS FOR WHICH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN MADE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE EFFECT THIS ASU WILL HAVE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES, BUT DOES NOT EXPECT IT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 201807, COMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING. THIS IS A SIMPLIFICATION THAT INVOLVES SEVERAL ASPECTS OF ACCOUNTING FOR NONEMPLOYEE SHARE BASED PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF TOPIC 718 TO INCLUDE SHARE BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS FOR ACQUIRING GOODS AND SERVICES FROM NONEMPLOYEES. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR LEXARIA FOR SEPTEMBER 1, 2019. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT IT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DURING THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2019, OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE LOWER COMPARED TO THE NINE-MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018, WHICH IS A RESULT OF THE DECREASES IN CONSULTING EXPENSES DUE TO LOWER CONTRACTUAL SHARE BASED AND SHARE BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES BUT INCLUDE INCREASES IN LEGAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS AND PATENT FILINGS, NEW EMPLOYEES AND R&D.  REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY BASED ON LICENSING USAGE FEES IN LINE WITH CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS, WHILE CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES REMAIN LOW DUE TO CHALLENGES IN SECURING EXPANSIVE DISTRIBUTION OPPORTUNITIES, PRODUCTION CHALLENGES AND PAYMENT PROCESSING CHANGES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURSUE MORE WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION POSSIBILITIES WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO UNLOCK MORE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER REVENUES.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AND 2018  THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2019, WHICH ARE INCLUDED HEREIN.

DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2019, OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE LOWER COMPARED TO THE THREE-MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018, WHICH IS A RESULT OF THE DECREASES IN CONSULTING EXPENSES DUE TO LOWER CONTRACTUAL SHARE BASED AND SHARE BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES BUT INCLUDE INCREASES IN LEGAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS AND PATENT FILINGS, NEW EMPLOYEES AND R&D.  REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY BASED ON LICENSING USAGE FEES IN LINE WITH CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS, WHILE CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES REMAIN LOW DUE TO CHALLENGES IN SECURING EXPANSIVE DISTRIBUTION OPPORTUNITIES, PRODUCTION CHALLENGES AND PAYMENT PROCESSING CHANGES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURSUE MORE WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION POSSIBILITIES WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO UNLOCK MORE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER REVENUES.  THE TREND OF HEMP OIL FORTIFIED FOODS, AND HEMP SEED PRODUCTS, GAINING CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE CONTINUED AND PROVIDES A REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SALES COULD INCREASE. THOSE TRENDS SHOULD SUPPORT HIGHER POTENTIAL CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES. IN ADDITION, LEGISLATIVE TRENDS IN AMERICA AND IN MANY NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD SUCH AS CANADA AND THE UK ARE SUPPORTIVE OF ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HEMP-BASED FOODS AND SUPPLEMENTS SECTOR. THOSE TRENDS COULD SUPPORT HIGHER POTENTIAL CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES. RELEASE OF THE TURBOCBD  TM  PRODUCT WAS SUCCESSFUL BUT SALES WERE LIMITED BY CHANGES TO PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL. THE INITIAL RELEASE OF CHRGD+ WAS WELL RECEIVED AND WE ARE IN PROGRESS OF FINAL DEVELOPMENT AND RELEASE OF THE ONLINE ORDERING PORTAL FOR BOTH RETAIL AND CHANNEL DISTRIBUTION, WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE OPERATIONAL DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  PAGE 44 OF 49  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR 2019 THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO DERIVE THE MAJORITY OF ITS REVENUES FROM TECHNOLOGY LICENSING TO THIRD PARTIES NOTING THAT IP TERRITORY FEES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN NEW DEFINITIVE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OCCUR AND IP USAGE FEES ARE DEPENDENT UPON LICENSEES OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENTS THE TECHNOLOGY BASED UPON REGULATORY APPROVAL. CANADIAN REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR INGESTIBLE PRODUCTS IS ANTICIPATED OCTOBER 17, 2019, WHEN ENTITIES ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR PERMITS TO DISTRIBUTE AND SELL THEIR PRODUCTS. AT AUGUST 31, 2015 THE COMPANY HAD ZERO TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENTS ENTERED. BY AUGUST 31, 2016 WE HAD ENTERED SEVERAL LOI\u2019S OR DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY OUT-LICENSING. DURING THE PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 WE ENTERED INTO SIX NEW LICENSING AGREEMENTS (ALTHOUGH SOME WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CANCELLED DUE TO NON PERFORMANCE) THAT INCREASED OUR IP LICENSING REVENUE AND WE EXPECT ADDITIONAL REVENUE WILL BE GENERATED FROM THE LICENSEES UTILIZING THE TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR PROCESSES FROM THE USAGE FEES AS THEIR PRODUCTION AND SALES OCCUR. IT IS THE COMPANY\u2019S VIEW THAT THE DECEMBER 9, 2017, GRANT OF PATENT US 9,839,612 B2, THE GRANTS OF US 9,972,680 B2 AND US 9,974,739 B2 DURING MAY 2018, THE SEPTEMBER 25, 2018 GRANT OF US 10,084,044 B2, THE OCTOBER 16, 2018 GRANT OF US 10,103,225 B2 AND ITS EXPANDING PATENT PORTFOLIO ARE POSITIVE STEPS IN ENABLING THE GENERATION OF MORE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES. AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED MORE THAN 10 FORMAL LETTERS OF INTENT OR DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS AND IS NEGOTIATING MORE.  WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT ALL OF THE LETTERS OF INTENT INTO WHICH WE ENTER WILL RESULT IN DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS WITH PAYING CUSTOMERS AND CANNOT PREDICT HOW MANY WILL. WE BELIEVE THAT STRENGTHENING AND EXPANDING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO AND CONDUCTING SUPPORTIVE R&D WILL JOINTLY CONTRIBUTE TO STRENGTHENING REVENUE PROSPECTS.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSISTENT BETWEEN THE COMPARISON PERIODS WITH INCREASES IN ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONS, INVESTOR RELATIONS, INCREASES TO ONGOING LEGAL FEES FOR PATENT AND TRADEMARK FILINGS, LEGAL FEES FOR CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS, R&D PROGRAMS AND EMPLOYEE ADDITIONS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY CONTINUED ITS INVESTMENT IN EXPANDING ITS PATENT AND TRADEMARK FILINGS, LEASE-HOLD IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE NEW HEAD OFFICE LOCATION WITH IN-HOUSE HEALTH CANADA COMPLIANT RESEARCH LAB, AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES.

THE COMPANY\u2019S ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE PRESENTATION OF ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND WHICH REQUIRE THE GREATEST USE OF JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES BY MANAGEMENT, ARE DESIGNATED AS ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  SEE DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES UNDER ITEM 7 IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  MANAGEMENT PERIODICALLY RE-EVALUATES AND ADJUSTS ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE.  THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019.  RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  SEE NOTE 1 \u2013 BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND THE DISCLOSURE THEREIN OF RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE (ADOPTED AND NOT YET ADOPTED) TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SET FORTH IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK  OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WERE $121.1 MILLION, A DECREASE OF 29 PERCENT COMPARED TO $169.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018.  IRRIGATION SEGMENT REVENUES DECREASED 23 PERCENT TO $98.6 MILLION AND INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENT REVENUES DECREASED 45 PERCENT TO $22.4 MILLION.  NET EARNINGS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WERE $2.9 MILLION, OR $0.27 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO NET EARNINGS OF $10.4 MILLION, OR $0.96 PER DILUTED SHARE, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018.  NET EARNINGS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WERE REDUCED BY AFTER-TAX COSTS OF $2.6 MILLION, OR $0.23 PER DILUTED SHARE, RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S \u201cFOUNDATION FOR GROWTH\u201d INITIATIVE.  THE PRE-TAX COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH INITIATIVE DURING THE QUARTER WERE $3.9 MILLION, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF PROFESSIONAL CONSULTING FEES AND SEVERANCE COSTS.  THESE COSTS, AND ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS ANTICIPATED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INITIATIVE, ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH IMPROVED OPERATING INCOME IN FUTURE PERIODS.  NET EARNINGS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018 WERE REDUCED BY AFTER-TAX COSTS OF $7.5 MILLION, OR $0.70 PER DILUTED SHARE, RELATED TO THE FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH INITIATIVE.  - 20  -  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN ADDITION,  THE BUSINESS DIVESTITURES COMPLETED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 AND THE FIRS  T QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AS PART OF THE FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH INITIATIVE RESULTED IN A  $27.2  MILLION  REDUCTION IN IRRIGATION REVENUES DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER  OF FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL  2018.  NET  EARNINGS  FOR  THE  THIRD  QUARTER  OF  FISCAL 201  8  INCLUDED  $1.5  MILLION, OR $0.  14  PER DILUTED SHARE  , RELATED TO THE BUSINESS DIVESTITURES.  A KEY FINANCIAL OBJECTIVE OF THE FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH IS TO ACHIEVE OPERATING MARGIN PERFORMANCE OF 11 PERCENT TO 12 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2020 ASSUMING NO IMPROVEMENT IN MARKET CONDITIONS FROM FISCAL 2017.  THE COMPANY\u2019S IRRIGATION REVENUES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE NEED FOR IRRIGATED AGRICULTURAL CROP PRODUCTION, WHICH, IN TURN, DEPENDS UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY DRIVERS.  \u2022  AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY PRICES  \u2013 A  S OF MAY 2019, C  ORN PRICES HAVE INCREASED FIVE PERCENT AND SOYBEAN PRICES HAVE DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 17 PERCENT FROM MAY 2018.  CORN PRICES HAVE INCREASED FURTHER IN JUNE AS SEVERE WET WEATHER IN THE U.S. DELAYED PLANTINGS AND FORCED FARMERS TO CURTAIL ACREAGE, RESULTING IN REDUCED SUPPLY ESTIMATES.   SOYBEAN PRICES REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE FROM A RECORD SOYBEAN HARVEST LAST YEAR AND FROM DIMINISHED EXPORTS, DUE IN PART TO AN ONGOING TRADE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA.  \u2022  NET FARM INCOME  \u2013  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (THE \u201cUSDA\u201d) REPORT FROM MARCH 2019 ESTIMATED U.S. 2019 NET FARM INCOME TO BE $69.4 BILLION, UP 10 PERCENT FROM THE USDA\u2019S U.S. 2018 NET FARM INCOME OF $63.1 BILLION.  HOWEVER, FORECASTED 2019 NET FARM INCOME REMAINS SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THE 10-YEAR U.S. NET FARM INCOME AVERAGE OF $85.3 BILLION (IN NOMINAL DOLLARS), PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF WEAKER PRICES FOR MOST MAJOR CROPS.  \u2022  WEATHER CONDITIONS \u2013  DEMAND FOR IRRIGATION EQUIPMENT IS OFTEN POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY STORM DAMAGE AND PROLONGED PERIODS OF DROUGHT CONDITIONS AS PRODUCERS LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF LOW CROP PRODUCTION AND CROP FAILURES.  CONVERSELY, DEMAND FOR IRRIGATION EQUIPMENT CAN BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED DURING PERIODS OF MORE PREDICTABLE OR EXCESSIVE NATURAL PRECIPITATION.  BEGINNING IN MARCH AND CONTINUING THROUGH MAY, ABOVE-AVERAGE RAINFALL AND WIDESPREAD FLOODING IN MANY PARTS OF THE MIDWEST HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED DEMAND FOR IRRIGATION EQUIPMENT IN THE SHORT-TERM.  \u2022  GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES  \u2013 A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS CAN AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  THE AGRICULTURE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2018 (THE \u201cFARM BILL\u201d) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN DECEMBER 2018.  THE 2018 FARM BILL CONTINUES MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE IN THE AGRICULTURAL ACT OF 2014, WHICH EXPIRED IN SEPTEMBER 2018.  SUCH PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A DEGREE OF CERTAINTY TO GROWERS, INCLUDING FUNDING FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY INCENTIVES PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO FARMERS TO IMPLEMENT CONSERVATION PRACTICES, AND IS FREQUENTLY USED TO ASSIST IN THE PURCHASE OF CENTER PIVOT IRRIGATION SYSTEMS.  \u2022  THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\u201cU.S. TAX REFORM\u201d) ENACTED IN DECEMBER 2017 INCREASED THE BENEFIT OF CERTAIN TAX INCENTIVES, SUCH AS THE SECTION 179 INCOME TAX DEDUCTION AND SECTION 168 BONUS DEPRECIATION, WHICH ARE INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE EQUIPMENT PURCHASES BY ALLOWING THE ENTIRE COST OF EQUIPMENT TO BE TREATED AS AN EXPENSE IN THE YEAR OF PURCHASE RATHER THAN AMORTIZED OVER ITS USEFUL LIFE.  \u2022  BIOFUEL PRODUCTION CONTINUES TO BE A MAJOR DEMAND DRIVER FOR IRRIGATED CORN, SUGAR CANE AND SOYBEANS AS THESE CROPS ARE USED IN HIGH VOLUMES TO PRODUCE ETHANOL AND BIODIESEL.  IN NOVEMBER 2018, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (THE \u201cEPA\u201d) ISSUED RENEWABLE FUELS STANDARD (RFS) VOLUME REQUIREMENTS FOR 2019 THAT MODESTLY INCREASED VOLUME REQUIREMENTS COMPARED TO 2018 LEVELS. ON MAY 30, 2019, THE EPA FINALIZED REGULATORY CHANGES TO ALLOW GASOLINE BLENDED WITH UP TO 15 PERCENT ETHANOL (E15) TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 1-PSI REID VAPOR PRESSURE (RVP) WAIVER THAT FORMERLY APPLIED TO 10 PERCENT ETHANOL, OR E10, DURING SUMMER MONTHS.  UNDER THE FINALIZED EXPANSION, E15 WILL BE ALLOWED TO BE SOLD YEAR-ROUND WITHOUT ADDITIONAL RVP CONTROL RATHER THAN BEING AVAILABLE FOR SALE JUST EIGHT MONTHS OF THE YEAR.  \u2022  MANY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS ARE AFFECTED BY GOVERNMENT POLICIES SUCH AS SUBSIDIES AND OTHER AGRICULTURALLY RELATED INCENTIVES.  WHILE THESE POLICIES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON INDIVIDUAL MARKETS, THEY TYPICALLY DO NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF THE COMPANY.  \u2022  CURRENCY  \u2013 THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR FLUCTUATES IN RELATION TO THE VALUE OF CURRENCIES IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES TO WHICH THE COMPANY EXPORTS PRODUCTS AND IN WHICH THE COMPANY MAINTAINS LOCAL OPERATIONS. THE STRENGTHENING OF THE DOLLAR INCREASES THE COST IN THE LOCAL CURRENCY OF THE PRODUCTS EXPORTED FROM THE U.S. INTO THESE COUNTRIES AND, THEREFORE, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERNATIONAL SALES AND MARGINS. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE  - 21 -  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OF SALES MADE IN ANY AFFECTED FOREIGN CURRENCIES WI  LL  DECLINE  AS THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR  RISES  IN RELATION TO THESE OTHER CURRENCIES.  INTERNATIONAL IRRIGATION MARKETS REMAIN ACTIVE WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION, HOWEVER REGIONAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, CURRENCY CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS CAN CREATE A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT.  ADDITIONALLY, INTERNATIONAL RESULTS ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON PROJECT SALES WHICH TEND TO FLUCTUATE AND CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST ACCURATELY.  THE INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT TO SOME EXTENT ON GOVERNMENT SPENDING FOR ROAD CONSTRUCTION.  IN DECEMBER 2015, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENACTED A FIVE-YEAR, $305 BILLION HIGHWAY-FUNDING BILL TO FUND HIGHWAY AND BRIDGE PROJECTS, THE FIRST LONG-TERM NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SPENDING BILL IN A DECADE.  IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION HAS CHANGED HIGHWAY SAFETY PRODUCT CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. THE CHANGE HAS REQUIRED ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING AND COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPETITIVE POSITIONING OF THE COMPANY\u2019S HIGHWAY SAFETY PRODUCTS.  IN SPITE OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING UNCERTAINTY, OPPORTUNITIES EXIST FOR MARKET EXPANSION IN EACH OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCT LINES. DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S TRANSPORTATION SAFETY PRODUCTS CONTINUES TO BE DRIVEN BY POPULATION GROWTH AND THE NEED FOR IMPROVED ROAD SAFETY.  THE BACKLOG OF UNSHIPPED ORDERS AT MAY 31, 2019 WAS $42.5 MILLION COMPARED WITH $55.8 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2018.  APPROXIMATELY $12.4 MILLION OF THE REDUCTION IN BACKLOG RESULTED FROM THE BUSINESS DIVESTITURES COMPLETED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE DIVESTITURES, IRRIGATION SEGMENT BACKLOGS WERE HIGHER AND INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENT BACKLOGS WERE LOWER COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  SUBSEQUENT TO MAY 31, 2019, A $15.0 MILLION ROAD ZIPPER SYSTEM  \u00ae  ORDER WAS RECEIVED FROM A CUSTOMER IN JAPAN, WITH DELIVERY EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  THE COMPANY\u2019S BACKLOG CAN FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO THE SEASONALITY, CYCLICALITY, TIMING AND EXECUTION OF CONTRACTS.  BACKLOG TYPICALLY REPRESENTS LONG-TERM PROJECTS AS WELL AS SHORT LEAD-TIME ORDERS, AND THEREFORE IS GENERALLY NOT A GOOD INDICATION OF THE NEXT FISCAL QUARTER\u2019S REVENUES.  THE GLOBAL DRIVERS FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S MARKETS OF POPULATION GROWTH, EXPANDED FOOD PRODUCTION, EFFICIENT WATER USE AND INFRASTRUCTURE EXPANSION SUPPORT THE COMPANY\u2019S LONG-TERM GROWTH GOALS.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS ARE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WHERE IRRIGATION USE IS LESS DEVELOPED AND DEMAND IS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY FOOD SECURITY, WATER SCARCITY AND POPULATION GROWTH.  - 22  -  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  THE FOLLOWING SECTION PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING RESULTS DISPLAYED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AND MAY 31, 2018.

TO REFLECT MANAGEMENT'S REVISED PERSPECTIVE, THE COMPANY NOW CLASSIFIES ITS OPERATIONS IN THE FOLLOWING THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, AND BIOMETRICS.

WE BELIEVE OUR SEGMENTS MAY HAVE EXPANDING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES WITH CERTAIN LEVELS OF VOLATILITY RELATED TO DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, NEW CAR SALES, INCREASED COMPETITION BY MANUFACTURERS, PRIVATE LABELS, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS, DISCRETIONARY CONSUMER SPENDING AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  ALSO, ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS WHICH COULD AFFECT THE CARRYING VALUE OF INVENTORIES AND GROSS MARGINS IN THE FUTURE.  OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR BUSINESS BY ACQUIRING NEW BRANDS, EMBRACING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, EXPANDING PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND APPLYING THIS TO A CONTINUED STREAM OF NEW PRODUCTS THAT SHOULD INCREASE GROSS MARGINS AND IMPROVE OPERATING INCOME. IN ADDITION, IT IS OUR INTENTION TO CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE SYNERGISTIC COMPANIES THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO LEVERAGE OUR OVERHEAD, PENETRATE NEW MARKETS AND EXPAND EXISTING PRODUCT CATEGORIES THROUGH OUR BUSINESS CHANNELS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IF THE APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY ARISES, THE COMPANY WILL EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL DIVESTITURE OF A PRODUCT LINE OR BUSINESS.  ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS  THERE WERE NO ACQUISITIONS OR DISPOSITIONS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES REPORTED IN THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE JUDGMENTS CAN BE SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX, AND CONSEQUENTLY, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES RELATE TO REVENUE RECOGNITION; ACCRUED SALES INCENTIVES; ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RESERVES; INVENTORY VALUATION; VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS; VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL, TRADEMARKS, AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS; WARRANTIES; STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION; RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS; AND THE RESERVE FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS IDENTIFIED IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE COMPANY'S FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019. SINCE FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR CHANGES TO THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES RELATED TO THEM.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  AS YOU READ THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, REFER TO THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS) INCOME, WHICH PRESENT THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AND 2018.  THE FOLLOWING TABLES SET FORTH, FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED, CERTAIN STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS DATA FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AND 2018.  NET SALES  MAY 31,  2019  2018  $ CHANGE% CHANGE  THREE MONTHS ENDED.

SALES IN THIS SEGMENT DECREASED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING A DECLINE IN SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EVO PRODUCT LINE, WHICH WAS DUE IN PART TO LAUNCH DELAYS FOR CERTAIN VEHICLE MODELS, AS WELL AS SLOWER SALES FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS THAT BEGAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A SOFTENING OF GLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY SALES. THE COMPANY\u2019S OEM REMOTE START AND SECURITY SALES ALSO DECLINED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AS ONE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMERS DISCONTINUED A PROGRAM FOR PASSIVE ENTRY PRODUCTS FOR ITS VEHICLES. ADDITIONALLY, SALES OF AFTERMARKET SATELLITE RADIO AND HEADREST PRODUCTS HAVE ALL DECLINED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN STANDARD FACTORY EQUIPPED VEHICLES WITH THESE OPTIONS. OFFSETTING THE SALES DECLINES IN THIS SEGMENT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WERE INCREASES IN SALES OF CERTAIN SAFETY AND SECURITY PRODUCTS AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SALES REPRESENTED 68.1% OF OUR NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, COMPARED TO 60.4% IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. SALES INCREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS. THE COMPANY\u2019S PREMIUM HOME SEPARATE SPEAKER PRODUCT SALES INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF TWO NEW DOMESTIC PRODUCT LINES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S PREMIUM COMMERCIAL SPEAKER PRODUCTS HAVE HAD A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019. BOTH RECEPTION AND KARAOKE PRODUCT SALES WERE UP FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AS A RESULT OF EXPANDED SKU OFFERINGS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS, AND SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ACTIVITY BANDS HAVE INCREASED YEAR OVER YEAR AS A RESULT OF INCREASED MOTION PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL PRODUCT OFFERINGS FOR PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING THE APPLE WATCH. OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WERE DECREASES IN SALES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, SUCH AS THE COMPANY\u2019S PROJECT NURSERY LINE, AS A RESULT OF THE ELIMINATION OF BABY VIDEO MONITORS, AND THE COMPANY\u2019S PREMIUM BLUETOOTH/WIRELESS SOLUTIONS, AS A RESULT OF DELAYS IN THE LAUNCH OF NEW PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUED TO SEE A DECLINE IN SALES OF CERTAIN HOOK-UP PRODUCTS AND REMOTES AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEMAND AND TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS DUE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTINUING RATIONALIZATION OF SKU\u2019S WITH THE GOAL OF LIMITING SALES OF LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS. WITHIN ITS EUROPEAN MARKET, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED DECREASES IN SALES AS A RESULT OF INCREASED COMPETITION FOR SET TOP BOX PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN ITS DIY PRODUCT LINES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019.  BIOMETRICS SALES REPRESENTED 0.01% OF OUR NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, COMPARED TO 0.2% IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THIS SEGMENT EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018, THE COMPANY HAD SALES OF ITS NXT PERIMETER ACCESS PRODUCT. INVENTORY FOR THIS PRODUCT SOLD OUT DURING THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, THE BIOMETRICS SEGMENT DID NOT HAVE INVENTORY. ADDITIONAL PRODUCT INVENTORY IS EXPECTED TO BE DELIVERED SUBSEQUENT TO THE FIRST QUARTER END IN ORDER TO FILL CUSTOMER ORDERS.  GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE  MAY 31,  2019  2018  $ CHANGE% CHANGE  THREE MONTHS ENDED.

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES IN THE AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS SEGMENT  DECREASED  280 BASIS POINTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE DECREASE IN MARGINS WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE DECLINES IN OEM SECURITY AND REMOTE START SALES, AS WELL AS AFTERMARKET HEADREST PRODUCTS, AS THESE PRODUCTS GENERATE HIGH GROSS MARGINS FOR THE SEGMENT. AS AN OFFSET TO THESE MARGIN DECLINES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, THE AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS SEGMENT EXPERIENCED DECLINES IN SATELLITE RADIO SALES, WHICH CONTRIBUTE LOWER MARGINS TO THE GROUP, WHILE INCREASED SALES OF CERTAIN AFTERMARKET SECURITY PRODUCTS CONTRIBUTED FAVORABLY TO MARGINS FOR THE QUARTER.  33  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES IN THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS  SEGMENT  IN  CREASED  130  BASIS POINTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  THE INCREASE IN MARGINS FOR THE QUARTER WERE DRIVEN  PARTIALLY  BY INCREASE  D SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PREMIUM HOME SEPARATE SPEAKERS, MOBILITY PRODUCTS, AND COMMERCIAL SPEAKERS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, WHICH EARN HIGH MARGINS FOR THE SEGMENT. MARGINS WERE ALSO POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S KARAOKE  PRODUCTS, WHICH ALSO INCREASED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019. OFFSETTING THESE MARGIN INCREASES  WERE  DECLINES IN MARGINS WITHIN OUR EUROPEAN MARKET CAUSED  BY CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX, DISCOUNTS  OFFERED ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS DURING THE THREE MONTH  S ENDED MAY 31, 2019 THAT WERE NOT OFFERED IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AS WELL AS HIGHER WAREHOUSING COSTS INCURRED RELATED TO THE USE OF A THIRD PARTY FOR WAREHOUSING SERVICES BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THE COMPANY ALSO HAD A DECREASE IN  SALES OF HOOK-UP AND  REMOTE  PRODUCTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019.  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES IN THE BIOMETRICS SEGMENT INCREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE RELEASE OF INVENTORY RESERVES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WHICH HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE SEGMENT\u2019S GROSS MARGIN FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019.  OPERATING EXPENSES  MAY 31,  2019  2018  $ CHANGE% CHANGE  THREE MONTHS ENDED.  OPERATING EXPENSES.

SELLING EXPENSES DECREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS RELATED TO FISCAL 2019 RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, LOWER COMMISSIONS AS A RESULT OF THE DECLINE IN SALES, AND LOWER ADVERTISING COSTS AND DISPLAY AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, AS MANY DISPLAYS AND FIXTURES ARE FULLY AMORTIZED. THESE EXPENSE DECREASES WERE OFFSET BY SALARY INCREASES WITHIN SELLING RESULTING FROM TRANSFERS OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES FROM GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE TO SELLING IN CONJUNCTION WITH RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES TAKING PLACE IN FISCAL 2019.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE REIMBURSEMENT OF CERTAIN PROFESSIONAL FEES AND DISBURSEMENTS RESULTING FROM THE FAVORABLE OUTCOME OF A LAWSUIT THAT WAS RECEIVED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018, WHICH DID NOT REPEAT IN THE CURRENT YEAR. OFFSETTING THIS INCREASE TO GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WERE DECREASES IN SALARY EXPENSE DUE TO A REDUCTION IN HEADCOUNT AND THE TRANSFER OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES TO SELLING IN CONJUNCTION WITH FISCAL 2019 RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES.  ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 DECREASED AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, EXPENSES WERE DOWN DUE TO DECREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES RELATED TO PROJECTS NEARING THEIR COMPLETION. THESE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE USE OF OUTSIDE LABOR FOR CERTAIN PROJECTS DURING THE QUARTER, AS WELL AS HIGHER CUSTOMER REIMBURSEMENT COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD.

DURING FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY MADE AN AMENDMENT TO ITS WELLS FARGO LENDING AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE FEES CHARGED FOR THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE LINE OF CREDIT WERE LOWERED. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST AND BANK CHARGES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE RESULTING REDUCTION IN THESE FEES AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  34  EQUITY IN INCOME OF EQUITY INVESTEE REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S SHARE  OF INCOME FROM ITS 50% NON-CONTROLLING OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN ASA ELECTRONICS LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES (\"ASA\").  THE  DECREASE  IN INCOME  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  IS A RESULT OF LOWER SALES IN CERTAIN MARKETS AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, THE IMPA  CT OF TARIFFS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN PRODUCT RECALL EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 THAT WERE NOT PRESENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  OTHER, NET INCLUDES NET FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS OR LOSSES, INTEREST INCOME, RENTAL INCOME, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS INCOME AND EXPENSE. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, OTHER, NET INCREASED DUE PRIMARILY TO THE BENEFIT FROM A KEY MAN LIFE INSURANCE POLICY IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,000, RELATED TO A FORMER EMPLOYEE OF KLIPSCH GROUP, INC. THAT VOXX BECAME THE BENEFICIARY OF IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF KLIPSCH IN FISCAL 2012.  INCOME TAX PROVISION  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WAS AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF 52.7% ON A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $5,017, COMPARED TO AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF 30.4% ON A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $3,665, IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 DIFFERS FROM THE STATUTORY RATE OF 21%  PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMMEDIATE U.S. TAXATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS, NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST RELATED TO EYELOCK LLC, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES, NONDEDUCTIBLE PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, AND INCOME TAXED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AT VARYING TAX RATES. IN ADDITION, THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE PRIMARILY INCREASED FOR U.S. TAX CREDITS FOR WHICH NO INCOME TAX BENEFIT CAN BE RECOGNIZED  . THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018 DIFFERED FROM THE STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO  THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST RELATED TO EYELOCK LLC, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES, NONDEDUCTIBLE PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, INCOME TAXED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AT VARYING TAX RATES, AND THE EXPECTED REALIZATION OF CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BASED ON FORECASTED INCOME INCLUDING DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES RELATES TO INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2020 IS 54.2%. THE CALCULATION OF THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS BASED ON OUR ANNUAL PRETAX INCOME FORECAST WHICH INCLUDES PROFITABLE JURISDICTIONS ANTICIPATING AN INCOME TAX PROVISION AND LOSS JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH A LIMITED TAX BENEFIT CAN BE RECOGNIZED. IF THE ANNUAL PRETAX INCOME FORECAST IS ACHIEVED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FISCAL YEAR, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES RECOGNIZING AN INCOME TAX PROVISION IN THE SUBSEQUENT QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020.  EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE  EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE ARE NOT FINANCIAL MEASURES RECOGNIZED BY GAAP.

ADJUSTED EBITDA REPRESENTS EBITDA ADJUSTED FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND LIFE INSURANCE PROCEEDS. DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ARE NON-CASH ITEMS. DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BASED ON ADJUSTED EBITDA.  WE PRESENT EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE IN THIS FORM 10-Q BECAUSE WE CONSIDER THEM TO BE USEFUL AND APPROPRIATE SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF OUR PERFORMANCE. ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE HELP US TO EVALUATE OUR PERFORMANCE WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN GAAP CALCULATIONS THAT MAY NOT HAVE A DIRECT CASH IMPACT ON OUR CURRENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN COSTS OR GAINS RELATING TO CERTAIN EVENTS ALLOWS FOR A MORE MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF OUR RESULTS FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD. THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, AS WE DEFINE THEM, ARE NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY ENTITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES AND MAY NOT BE AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE FOR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO OTHER COMPANIES.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS A PARTNER IN A JOINT VENTURE WHICH OPERATES RETAIL STORES IN MEXICO UNDER THE NAME BED BATH & BEYOND.  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS OPERATIONS AS TWO OPERATING SEGMENTS: NORTH AMERICAN RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL SALES. THE INSTITUTIONAL SALES OPERATING SEGMENT, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF LINEN HOLDINGS, DOES NOT MEET THE QUANTITATIVE THRESHOLDS UNDER U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THEREFORE IS NOT A REPORTABLE SEGMENT.  THE COMPANY'S MISSION IS TO BE TRUSTED BY ITS CUSTOMERS AS THE EXPERT FOR THE HOME AND HEART-FELT LIFE EVENTS. THESE INCLUDE CERTAIN LIFE EVENTS THAT EVOKE STRONG EMOTIONAL CONNECTIONS SUCH AS GETTING MARRIED, MOVING TO A NEW HOME, HAVING A BABY, GOING TO COLLEGE AND DECORATING A ROOM, WHICH THE COMPANY SUPPORTS THROUGH ITS WEDDING AND BABY REGISTRIES, MOVER AND STUDENT LIFE PROGRAMS, AND DESIGN CONSULTATION SERVICES.  TO ADVANCE ITS MISSION, THE COMPANY IS EXECUTING ON A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO TRANSFORM ITS BUSINESS AND POSITION THE COMPANY FOR LONG-TERM SUCCESS.

THE BOARD HAS FORMED A CEO SEARCH COMMITTEE TO IDENTIFY A PERMANENT CEO.  DURING THIS INTERIM PERIOD, THE BOARD AND MANAGEMENT TEAM ARE TAKING A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO THE COMPANY'S ON-GOING BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND HAVE IDENTIFIED FOUR KEY NEAR-TERM PRIORITIES THAT INCLUDE: 1) STABILIZING AND DRIVING TOP-LINE GROWTH; 2) RESETTING THE COST STRUCTURE; 3) REVIEWING AND OPTIMIZING THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSET BASE, INCLUDING ITS PORTFOLIO OF RETAIL BANNERS; AND 4) REFINING THE COMPANY\u2019S ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE.  THE INTEGRATION OF RETAIL STORE AND CUSTOMER FACING DIGITAL CHANNELS ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE ITS CUSTOMERS WITH A SEAMLESS SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. IN-STORE PURCHASES ARE PRIMARILY FULFILLED FROM THAT STORE'S INVENTORY, OR MAY ALSO BE SHIPPED TO A CUSTOMER FROM ONE OF THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, FROM A VENDOR, OR FROM ANOTHER STORE.

THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO PICK UP ONLINE ORDERS IN A STORE, AS WELL AS RETURN ONLINE PURCHASES TO A STORE. CUSTOMERS CAN ALSO MAKE PURCHASES THROUGH ONE OF THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTERS AND IN-STORE THROUGH THE BEYOND STORE, THE COMPANY'S PROPRIETARY, WEB-BASED PLATFORM. THESE CAPABILITIES ALLOW THE COMPANY TO BETTER SERVE CUSTOMERS ACROSS VARIOUS CHANNELS.  OPERATING IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE RETAIL INDUSTRY, THE COMPANY, ALONG WITH OTHER RETAIL COMPANIES, IS INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDING THE HOUSING MARKET, UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND COMMODITY PRICES; THE OVERALL MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND RELATED CHANGES IN THE RETAILING ENVIRONMENT; CONSUMER PREFERENCES, SPENDING HABITS AND ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES; UNUSUAL WEATHER PATTERNS AND NATURAL DISASTERS; COMPETITION FROM EXISTING AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS ACROSS ALL CHANNELS; POTENTIAL SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION; THE ABILITY TO FIND SUITABLE LOCATIONS AT ACCEPTABLE OCCUPANCY COSTS AND OTHER TERMS TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S PLANS FOR NEW STORES; AND THE ABILITY TO ASSESS AND IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGIES IN SUPPORT OF THE COMPANY'S DEVELOPMENT OF ITS OMNICHANNEL CAPABILITIES. THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER, WHEN OR THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS.  THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS AN OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.  \u2022  NET SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WERE  $2.573 BILLION  , A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  6.6%  AS COMPARED WITH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018.  -19-  \u2022  COMPARABLE SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY  6.6%  , AS COMPARED TO A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  0.6%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  . FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  , COMPARABLE SALES CONSUMMATED IN-STORE DECLINED IN THE HIGH-SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE RANGE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES CONSUMMATED THROUGH CUSTOMER FACING DIGITAL CHANNELS.  COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDE SALES CONSUMMATED THROUGH ALL RETAIL CHANNELS WHICH HAVE BEEN OPERATING FOR TWELVE FULL MONTHS FOLLOWING THE OPENING PERIOD (TYPICALLY FOUR TO SIX WEEKS). THE COMPANY IS AN OMNICHANNEL RETAILER WITH CAPABILITIES THAT ALLOW A CUSTOMER TO USE MORE THAN ONE CHANNEL WHEN MAKING A PURCHASE, INCLUDING IN-STORE, ONLINE, WITH A MOBILE DEVICE OR THROUGH A CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER, AND HAVE IT FULFILLED, IN MOST CASES, EITHER THROUGH IN-STORE CUSTOMER PICKUP OR BY DIRECT SHIPMENT TO THE CUSTOMER FROM ONE OF THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES, STORES OR VENDORS.  SALES CONSUMMATED ON A MOBILE DEVICE WHILE PHYSICALLY IN A STORE LOCATION ARE RECORDED AS CUSTOMER FACING DIGITAL CHANNEL SALES. CUSTOMER ORDERS TAKEN IN-STORE BY AN ASSOCIATE THROUGH THE BEYOND STORE, THE COMPANY'S PROPRIETARY, WEB-BASED PLATFORM, ARE RECORDED AS IN-STORE SALES. CUSTOMER ORDERS RESERVED ONLINE AND PICKED UP IN A STORE ARE RECORDED AS IN-STORE SALES. SALES ORIGINALLY CONSUMMATED FROM CUSTOMER FACING DIGITAL CHANNELS AND SUBSEQUENTLY RETURNED IN-STORE ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF IN-STORE SALES.  STORES RELOCATED OR EXPANDED ARE EXCLUDED FROM COMPARABLE SALES IF THE CHANGE IN SQUARE FOOTAGE WOULD CAUSE MEANINGFUL DISPARITY IN SALES OVER THE PRIOR PERIOD. IN THE CASE OF A STORE TO BE CLOSED, SUCH STORE\u2019S SALES ARE NOT CONSIDERED COMPARABLE ONCE THE STORE CLOSING PROCESS HAS COMMENCED.

THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES PARTIALLY OFFSET THIS INCREASE, RESULTING FROM A GENERALLY STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR WHEN COMPARED TO THE CURRENCIES IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. U.S. SAME STORE SALES GROWTH REFLECTED THE SUSTAINED POSITIVE SALES TRENDS AND THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS, MARKETING AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH ALSO REFLECTED CONTINUED POSITIVE PERFORMANCE.  TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED $32.2 MILLION, OR 4.1%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $82.8 MILLION, OR 5.3%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN AND GLOBAL FRANCHISE REVENUES. THE INCREASES IN INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE ALSO PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORE REVENUES RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF 59 COMPANY-OWNED STORES TO CERTAIN OF OUR EXISTING U.S. FRANCHISEES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 (THE \u201cSECOND QUARTER STORE SALE\u201d). THESE CHANGES IN REVENUES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $12.8 MILLION, OR 10.1%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $22.8 MILLION, OR 8.8%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER ROYALTY REVENUES FROM U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISED STORES, AS WELL AS HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN MARGINS. HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND OTHER AREAS AND A $2.4 MILLION  PRE-TAX  LOSS RELATED TO THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE INCREASES. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  NET INCOME INCREASED $15.0 MILLION, OR 19.3%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $18.8 MILLION, OR 11.3%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, DRIVEN BY HIGHER INCOME FROM OPERATIONS AND LOWER TAX EXPENSE RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM HIGHER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION. NET INCOME FURTHER BENEFITED FROM LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 RESULTING FROM $3.3 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL INTEREST EXPENSE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH OUR RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTION COMPLETED ON APRIL 24, 2018 (THE \u201c2018 RECAPITALIZATION\u201d). THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM A HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE AND A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE FOLLOWING THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION.

THESE DECREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. COMPANY-OWNED SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 2.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.6% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. COMPANY-OWNED SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 5.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND INCREASED 5.8% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018.

U.S. FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 3.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 3.5% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER VOLUMES FROM INCREASED ORDERS RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF U.S. FRANCHISE STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD AND AN INCREASE IN MARKET BASKET PRICING. OUR MARKET BASKET PRICING TO STORES INCREASED 2.3% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.0% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WHICH RESULTED IN AN ESTIMATED INCREASE IN U.S. SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES OF $5.6 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND $11.8 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN  REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS INCREASED $1.8 MILLION, OR 4.4%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $4.0 MILLION, OR 4.9%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER VOLUMES FROM INCREASED ORDERS AND AN INCREASE IN MARKET BASKET PRICING. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OF $1.7 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND $3.8 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEE REVENUES  REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEES INCREASED $3.7 MILLION, OR 7.1%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $5.8 MILLION, OR 5.6%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD AND HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OF $3.0 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND $6.6 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 2.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.1% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 4.0% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND INCREASED 4.4% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COST OF SALES / OPERATING MARGIN  SECOND QUARTER  SECOND QUARTER  TWO FISCAL  TWO FISCAL  OF 2019  OF 2018  QUARTERS OF 2019  QUARTERS OF 2018  CONSOLIDATED REVENUES  $811.6  100.0%  $779.4  100.0%  $1,647.6  100.0%  $1,564.8  100.0%  CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES  495.0  61.0%  485.8  62.3%  1,008.7  61.2%  971.3  62.1%  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN  $316.7  39.0%  $293.6  37.7%  $639.0  38.8%  $593.4  37.9%  COST OF SALES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF COMPANY-OWNED STORE AND SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS INCURRED TO GENERATE RELATED REVENUES. COMPONENTS OF CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES PRIMARILY INCLUDE FOOD, LABOR, DELIVERY AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN (WHICH WE DEFINE AS REVENUES LESS COST OF SALES) INCREASED $23.1 MILLION, OR 7.9%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $45.6 MILLION, OR 7.7%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GLOBAL FRANCHISE REVENUES AND HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN VOLUMES. FRANCHISE REVENUES DO NOT HAVE A COST OF SALES COMPONENT, SO CHANGES IN THESE REVENUES HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE OPERATING MARGIN.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES, THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 1.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

OPERATING MARGIN IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY HIGHER LABOR COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. AS A PERCENTAGE OF STORE REVENUES, THE STORE OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE CHANGES IN OPERATING MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  \u2022  FOOD COSTS DECREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 26.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND DECREASED 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 27.0% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE LEVERAGING OF HIGHER SAME STORE SALES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN EFFICIENCY. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FOOD PRICES.  \u2022  LABOR COSTS DECREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 29.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 30.2% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCTION IN LABOR COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF STORE REVENUES IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE TO THE HIGH LABOR RATES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE SOLD STORES OPERATED. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND FULLY OFFSET IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE LABOR RATES IN OUR REMAINING COMPANY-OWNED STORE MARKETS.

AS A PERCENTAGE OF SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES, THE SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO PROCUREMENT SAVINGS AND LOWER INSURANCE EXPENSE, OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER LABOR COSTS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED $2.7 MILLION, OR 3.2%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $8.2 MILLION, OR 4.8%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND OTHER AREAS. A $2.4 MILLION  PRE-TAX  LOSS RELATED TO THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASES.  U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING EXPENSES  U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING EXPENSES INCREASED $7.6 MILLION, OR 9.4%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $14.5 MILLION, OR 8.9%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE TO HIGHER U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING REVENUES. U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING COSTS ARE ACCRUED AND EXPENSED WHEN THE RELATED U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED, AS OUR CONSOLIDATED  NOT-FOR-PROFIT  ADVERTISING FUND IS OBLIGATED TO EXPEND SUCH REVENUES ON ADVERTISING AND THESE REVENUES CANNOT BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET DECREASED $2.0 MILLION, OR 5.7%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $2.5 MILLION, OR 3.9%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE, NET IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 RESULTED FROM $3.3 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL INTEREST EXPENSE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND MORE THAN OFFSET IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 BY A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER AVERAGE BORROWINGS RESULTING FROM THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION AND OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES. A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  THE COMPANY\u2019S WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE INCREASED TO 4.1% IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, FROM 4.0% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND 3.9% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018, RESULTING FROM THE HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON THE DEBT OUTSTANDING IN 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES DECREASED $0.2 MILLION, OR 1.2%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $1.5 MILLION, OR 5.2%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. HIGHER  PRE-TAX  INCOME CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER TAX EXPENSE IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, BUT THESE INCREASES WERE FULLY OFFSET IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND PARTIALLY OFFSET IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 BY HIGHER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED TO 12.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND DECREASED TO 14.0% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 15.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND 14.7% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE OPERATED WITH MINIMAL POSITIVE WORKING CAPITAL OR NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OUR RECEIVABLE COLLECTION PERIODS AND INVENTORY TURN RATES ARE FASTER THAN THE NORMAL PAYMENT TERMS ON OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES. WE GENERALLY COLLECT OUR RECEIVABLES WITHIN THREE WEEKS FROM THE DATE OF THE RELATED SALE, AND WE GENERALLY EXPERIENCE 35 TO 45 INVENTORY TURNS PER YEAR. IN ADDITION, OUR SALES ARE NOT TYPICALLY SEASONAL, WHICH FURTHER LIMITS OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE USE OF OUR ONGOING CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO SERVICE OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK REDUCES OUR WORKING CAPITAL AMOUNTS. AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL OF $73.5 MILLION, EXCLUDING RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $152.7 MILLION, ADVERTISING FUND ASSETS, RESTRICTED, OF $117.7 MILLION AND ADVERTISING FUND LIABILITIES OF $113.4 MILLION. WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDES TOTAL UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $108.3 MILLION.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, OUR INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. BUSINESSES GREW STORE COUNTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE OUR UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, EXCESS CASH FROM OUR RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTIONS AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INVEST IN OUR CORE BUSINESS, SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL COMMITMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS OF JUNE 16, 2019.  BASED UPON OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF OPERATIONS AND ANTICIPATED GROWTH, WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, OUR CURRENT UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTE FACILITY WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO FUND THESE ITEMS AND CONTINUE TO REDUCE DEBT COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE EVENTS DESCRIBED UNDER \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OR THAT FUTURE BORROWINGS WILL BE AVAILABLE UNDER THE VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES OR OTHERWISE TO ENABLE US TO SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS OR TO MAKE ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OUR FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE, EXTEND OR REFINANCE OUR FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES AND TO SERVICE, EXTEND OR REFINANCE OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES WILL BE SUBJECT TO FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TO FINANCIAL, BUSINESS AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESTRICTED CASH  AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $115.9 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH HELD FOR FUTURE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS AND OTHER WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF OUR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATION STRUCTURE, $36.6 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH HELD IN A THREE-MONTH INTEREST RESERVE AS REQUIRED BY THE RELATED DEBT AGREEMENTS AND $0.2 MILLION OF OTHER RESTRICTED CASH FOR A TOTAL OF $152.7 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE ALSO HELD $61.3 MILLION OF ADVERTISING FUND RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, WHICH CAN ONLY BE USED FOR ACTIVITIES THAT PROMOTE THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA BRAND.  LONG-TERM DEBT  AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $3.45 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, OF WHICH $35.9 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY. OUR FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES FROM THE RECAPITALIZATIONS WE COMPLETED IN 2018, 2017 AND 2015 HAVE ORIGINAL SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF $17.6 MILLION IN THE REMAINDER OF 2019, $35.3 MILLION IN EACH OF 2020 AND 2021, $888.0 MILLION IN 2022, $26.3 MILLION IN EACH OF 2023 AND 2024, $1.14 BILLION IN 2025, $14.0 MILLION IN 2026 AND $1.27 BILLION IN 2027. AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND $126.9 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING, NET OF LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED OF $48.1 MILLION. THE LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR CASUALTY INSURANCE PROGRAMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN CENTER LEASES. BORROWINGS UNDER THE VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES ARE AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND, SUBJECT TO OTHER LIMITATIONS, OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS  OUR OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN FUNDED BY EXCESS CASH FLOWS. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO $750.0 MILLION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 12,295 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $3.3 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $269.14 PER SHARE.

(IN MILLIONS)  TWO FISCAL QUARTERS     OF 2019  TWO FISCAL QUARTERS     OF 2018  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY (USED IN)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $201.6  $154.7  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (2.5  )  (43.8  )  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (114.3  )  (30.1  )  EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES  0.1  (0.1  )  CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $84.8  $80.7  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $46.9 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE TO THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $26.1 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN NET INCOME OF $18.8 MILLION AND HIGHER  NON-CASH  AMOUNTS OF $2.0 MILLION. THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DURING 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 AND WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN ADVERTISING FUND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, RESTRICTED IN 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $2.5 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WHICH CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF $25.7 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND SUPPLY CHAIN CENTERS). THIS USE OF CASH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MATURITIES OF ADVERTISING FUND INVESTMENTS, RESTRICTED OF $15.2 MILLION AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS OF $8.2 MILLION, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $43.8 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018, WHICH CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF $37.3 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES, SUPPLY CHAIN CENTERS AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES) AND PURCHASES OF RESTRICTED ADVERTISING FUND INVESTMENTS OF $35.2 MILLION. THESE USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MATURITIES OF RESTRICTED ADVERTISING FUND INVESTMENTS OF $29.0 MILLION.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $114.3 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, PRIMARILY RELATED TO REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $82.9 MILLION (OF WHICH $65.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES), DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS OF $26.7 MILLION, PURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK OF $11.5 MILLION UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND TAX PAYMENTS FOR RESTRICTED STOCK UPON VESTING OF $2.6 MILLION. THESE USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS OF $9.3 MILLION.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $30.1 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018. WE ISSUED $825.0 MILLION OF DEBT IN CONNECTION WITH OUR 2018 RECAPITALIZATION AND BORROWED $80.0 MILLION UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES. HOWEVER, THESE INCREASES IN CASH WERE OFFSET BY REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $586.1 MILLION (OF WHICH $490.0 MILLION WAS AN OPTIONAL PREPAYMENT ON OUR 2015 FIVE-YEAR FIXED RATE NOTES USING A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION AND $80.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE REPAYMENT OF THE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES), PURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK OF $320.1 MILLION, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS OF $23.5 MILLION, AND CASH PAID FOR FINANCING COSTS RELATED TO OUR 2018 RECAPITALIZATION OF $8.2 MILLION. WE ALSO MADE $2.3 MILLION IN TAX PAYMENTS FOR RESTRICTED STOCK UPON VESTING AND RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $5.2 MILLION FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  THIS FILING CONTAINS VARIOUS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ABOUT THE COMPANY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 (THE \u201cACT\u201d) THAT ARE BASED ON CURRENT MANAGEMENT EXPECTATIONS THAT INVOLVE SUBSTANTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS EXPRESSED IN, OR IMPLIED BY, THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

OVERVIEW  THE FOLLOWING SECTION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH PART I, ITEM 1: CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THIS REPORT AS WELL AS PART I, ITEM 1: BUSINESS; AND PART II, ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THE COMPANY\u2019S 2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  COMPANY OVERVIEW  DELCATH SYSTEMS, INC. IS AN INTERVENTIONAL ONCOLOGY COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE TREATMENT OF PRIMARY AND METASTATIC LIVER CANCERS. OUR INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT\u2014MELPHALAN HYDROCHLORIDE FOR INJECTION FOR USE WITH THE DELCATH HEPATIC DELIVERY SYSTEM (\u201cMELPHALAN/HDS\u201d) \u2014IS DESIGNED TO ADMINISTER HIGH-DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY TO THE LIVER WHILE CONTROLLING SYSTEMIC EXPOSURE AND ASSOCIATED SIDE EFFECTS. IN EUROPE, OUR SYSTEM IS COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE UNDER THE TRADE NAME DELCATH HEPATIC CHEMOSAT  \u00ae  17  DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR MELPHALAN (  \u201c  CHEM  OSAT  \u201d  ), WHERE IT HAS BEEN USED AT MAJOR MEDICAL CENTERS TO TREAT A WIDE RANGE OF CANCERS OF THE LIVER.  OUR PRIMARY RESEARCH FOCUS IS ON OCULAR MELANOMA LIVER METASTASES (\u201cMOM\u201d) AND INTRAHEPATIC CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA (\u201cICC\u201d), A TYPE OF PRIMARY LIVER CANCER, AND CERTAIN OTHER CANCERS THAT ARE METASTATIC TO THE LIVER. WE BELIEVE THE DISEASE STATES WE ARE INVESTIGATING REPRESENT A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR GLOBAL MARKET OPPORTUNITY AND A CLEAR UNMET MEDICAL NEED.  OUR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (\u201cCDP\u201d) FOR MELPHALAN/HDS IS COMPRISED OF THE FOCUS CLINICAL TRIAL FOR PATIENTS WITH HEPATIC DOMINANT OCULAR MELANOMA (THE \u201cFOCUS TRIAL\u201d), A GLOBAL REGISTRATION CLINICAL TRIAL THAT IS INVESTIGATING OBJECTIVE RESPONSE RATE IN MOM, AND THE ALIGN TRIAL, A GLOBAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL FOR ICC (THE \u201cALIGN TRIAL\u201d). OUR CDP ALSO INCLUDES A REGISTRY FOR CHEMOSAT COMMERCIAL CASES PERFORMED IN EUROPE AND SPONSORSHIP OF SELECT INVESTIGATOR-INITIATED TRIALS (\u201cIITS\u201d).  THE DIRECTION AND FOCUS OF OUR CDP FOR CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS IS INFORMED BY; PRIOR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT CONDUCTED BETWEEN 2004 AND 2010, COMMERCIAL EXPERIENCE WITH CHEMOSAT CASES PERFORMED ON PATIENTS IN EUROPE, AND PRIOR REGULATORY ENGAGEMENT WITH THE FDA. EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM THIS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, EARLY EU  ROPEAN COMMERCIAL CASES AND UNITED STATES REGULATORY OPINION HAS LED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SEVERAL SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR PRODUCT AND THE ASSOCIATED MEDICAL PROCEDURE.  IN THE UNITED STATES, MELPHALAN/HDS IS CONSIDERED A COMBINATION DRUG AND DEVICE PRODUCT AND IS REGULATED AS A DRUG BY THE FDA. THE FDA HAS GRANTED US SIX ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATIONS, INCLUDING THREE ORPHAN DESIGNATIONS FOR THE USE OF THE DRUG MELPHALAN FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH MOM, HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA AND ICC. MELPHALAN/HDS  HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED FOR SALE IN THE UNITED STATES.  IN EUROPE, THE CURRENT VERSION OF OUR CHEMOSAT PRODUCT IS REGULATED AS A CLASS IIB MEDICAL DEVICE AND RECEIVED ITS CE MARK IN 2012. WE ARE IN AN EARLY PHASE OF COMMERCIALIZING THE CHEMOSAT SYSTEM IN SELECT MARKETS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) WHERE THE PROSPECT OF SECURING REIMBURSEMENT COVERAGE FOR THE PROCEDURE IS STRONGEST. IN 2015 NATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT COVERAGE FOR CHEMOSAT PROCEDURES WAS AWARDED IN GERMANY. IN 2016, COVERAGE LEVELS WERE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN HOSPITALS IN GERMANY AND REGIONAL SICKNESS FUNDS. COVERAGE LEVELS DETERMINED VIA THIS PROCESS ARE EXPECTED TO BE RENEGOTIATED ANNUALLY. IN 2017, DUTCH HEALTH AUTHORITIES ADDED CHEMOSAT TO THEIR TREATMENT GUIDELINES FOR PATIENTS WITH OCULAR MELANOMA M  ETASTATIC TO THE LIVER, AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD EVENTUAL REIMBURSEMENT IN THE DUTCH MARKET.  CURRENTLY THERE ARE FEW EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR CERTAIN CANCERS IN THE LIVER. TRADITIONAL TREATMENT OPTIONS INCLUDE SURGERY, SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY, LIVER TRANSPLANT, RADIATION THERAPY, INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY TECHNIQUES, AND ISOLATED HEPATIC PERFUSION. WE BELIEVE THAT CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS REPRESENT A POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT ADVANCEMENT IN REGIONAL THERAPY FOR PRIMARY LIVER CANCER AND CERTAIN OTHER CANCERS METASTATIC TO THE LIVER AND ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO TREAT THE ENTIRE LIVER EITHER AS A STANDALONE THERAPY OR AS A COMPLEMENT TO OTHER THERAPIES.  CANCERS IN THE LIVER \u2013 A SIGNIFICANT UNMET NEED  CANCERS OF THE LIVER REMAIN A MAJOR UNMET MEDICAL NEED GLOBALLY.  ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY\u2019S (\u201cACS\u201d)  CANCER FACTS & FIGURES 2018  REPORT, CANCER IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH AN ESTIMATED 609,640 DEATHS AND 1.7 MILLION NEW CASES EXPECTED TO BE DIAGNOSED IN 2018. CANCER IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH WORLDWIDE, ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY 9.6 MILLION DEATHS AND 18.1 MILLION NEW CASES IN 2018 ACCORDING TO GLOBOCAN, THE DATABASE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CANCER REGISTRIES. THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF CANCER IS ENORMOUS FOR PATIENTS, THEIR FAMILIES AND SOCIETY. THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE QUALITY AND RESEARCH ESTIMATES THAT THE DIRECT MEDICAL COSTS (TOTAL OF ALL HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES) FOR CANCER IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2015 WAS $80.2 BILLION. THE LIVER IS OFTEN THE LIFE-LIMITING ORGAN FOR CANCER PATIENTS AND ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF CANCER DEATH. PATIENT PROGNOSIS IS GENERALLY POOR ONCE CANCER HAS SPREAD TO THE LIVER.  LIVER CANCERS\u2014INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY  THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF LIVER CANCERS: PRIMARY LIVER CANCER AND METASTATIC LIVER DISEASE. PRIMARY LIVER CANCER (HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA OR \u201cHCC\u201d, INCLUDING ICC, ORIGINATES IN THE LIVER OR BILIARY TISSUE AND IS PARTICULARLY PREVALENT IN POPULATIONS WHERE THE PRIMARY RISK FACTORS FOR THE DISEASE, SUCH AS HEPATITIS-B, HEPATITIS-C, HIGH LEVELS OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, AFLATOXIN, CIGARETTE SMOKING AND EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL POLLUTANTS, ARE PRESENT. METASTATIC LIVER DISEASE, ALSO CALLED LIVER METASTASIS, OR SECONDARY LIVER CANCER, IS CHARACTERIZED BY MICROSCOPIC CANCER CELL CLUSTERS THAT DETACH FROM THE PRIMARY SITE OF DISEASE AND TRAVEL VIA THE BLOOD STREAM AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEM INTO THE LIVER, WHERE THEY GROW INTO NEW TUMORS. THESE METASTASES OFTEN CONTINUE TO GROW EVEN AFTER THE PRIMARY CANCER IN ANOTHER PART OF THE BODY HAS BEEN REMOVED.  GIVEN THE VITAL BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE LIVER, INCLUDING PROCESSING NUTRIENTS FROM FOOD AND FILTERING TOXINS FROM THE BLOOD, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR METASTASES TO SETTLE IN THE LIVER. IN MANY CASES PATIENTS DIE NOT AS A RESULT OF THEIR  18  PRIMARY CANCER, BUT FROM THE TUMORS THAT METASTASIZE TO THEIR LIVER.  IN THE UNITED STATES, METASTATIC LIVER DISEASE IS MORE PREVALENT THAN PRIMARY LIVER CANCER.  OCULAR MELANOMA  OCULAR MELANOMA IS ONE OF THE CANCER HISTOLOGIES WITH A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF METASTASIZING TO THE LIVER. BASED ON THIRD PARTY RESEARCH THAT WE COMMISSIONED IN 2018, WE ESTIMATE THAT UP TO 4,700 CASES OF OCULAR MELANOMA ARE DIAGNOSED IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE ANNUALLY, AND THAT APPROXIMATELY 55% OF THESE PATIENTS WILL DEVELOP METASTATIC DISEASE. OF METASTATIC CASES OF OCULAR MELANOMA, WE ESTIMATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 90% OF PATIENTS WILL DEVELOP LIVER INVOLVEMENT. ONCE OCULAR MELANOMA HAS SPREAD TO THE LIVER, CURRENT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS MEDIAN OVERALL SURVIVAL FOR THESE PATIENTS IS GENERALLY SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO STANDARD OF CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH OCULAR MELANOMA LIVER METASTASES. BASED ON THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN 2018, WE ESTIMATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 2,000 PATIENTS WITH OCULAR MELANOMA LIVER METASTASES IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR TREATMENT WITH THE MELPHALAN/HDS.  INTRAHEPATIC CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA  HEPATOBILIARY CANCERS INCLUDE HCC AND ICC, AND ARE AMONG THE MOST PREVALENT AND LETHAL FORMS OF CANCER. ACCORDING TO GLOBOCAN, AN ESTIMATED 78,500 NEW CASES OF HEPATOBILIARY CANCERS ARE DIAGNOSED IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE ANNUALLY. ACCORDING TO THE ACS, APPROXIMATELY 42,030 NEW CASES OF THESE CANCERS ARE EXPECTED TO BE DIAGNOSED IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2019, LEADING TO APPROXIMATELY 31,780 DEATHS.  ICC IS THE SECOND MOST COMMON PRIMARY LIVER TUMOR AND ACCOUNTS FOR 3% OF ALL GASTROINTESTINAL CANCERS AND 15% OF HEPATOBILIARY CASES DIAGNOSED IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE ANNUALLY.  WE BELIEVE THAT 90% OF ICC PATIENTS ARE NOT CANDIDATES FOR SURGICAL RESECTION, AND THAT APPROXIMATELY 20-30% OF THESE MAY BE CANDIDATES FOR CERTAIN FOCAL INTERVENTIONS. ACCORDING TO THIRD PARTY RESEARCH THAT WE COMMISSIONED IN 2018 WE ESTIMATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 9,300 ICC PATIENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE ANNUALLY COULD BE CANDIDATES FOR TREATMENT WITH MELPHALAN/HDS, WHICH WE BELIEVE REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT MARKET OPPORTUNITY.  ACCORDING TO THE ACS, THE OVERALL FIVE-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE FOR HEPATOBILIARY CANCERS IN THE UNITED STATES IS APPROXIMATELY 18%. FOR PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH A LOCALIZED STAGE OF DISEASE, THE ACS ESTIMATES 5-YEAR SURVIVAL AT 31%. THE ACS ESTIMATES THAT 5-YEAR SURVIVAL FOR ALL CANCERS IS 68%.  AB  OUT CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS  OUR PRODUCT ADMINISTERS CONCENTRATED REGIONAL CHEMOTHERAPY TO THE LIVER. THIS \u201cWHOLE ORGAN\u201d THERAPY IS PERFORMED BY ISOLATING THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM OF THE LIVER, INFUSING THE LIVER WITH A CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT, AND THEN FILTERING THE BLOOD PRIOR TO RETURNING IT TO THE PATIENT. DURING THE PROCEDURE, KNOWN AS PERCUTANEOUS HEPATIC PERFUSION, PHP  \u00ae  , (\u201cPHP THERAPY\u201d), THREE CATHETERS ARE PLACED PERCUTANEOUSLY THROUGH STANDARD INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY TECHNIQUES. THE CATHETERS TEMPORARILY ISOLATE THE LIVER FROM THE BODY\u2019S CIRCULATORY SYSTEM, ALLOW ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT MELPHALAN HYDROCHLORIDE DIRECTLY TO THE LIVER, AND COLLECT BLOOD EXITING THE LIVER FOR FILTRATION BY OUR PROPRIETARY FILTERS. THE FILTERS ABSOR  B CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT IN THE BLOOD, THEREBY REDUCING SYSTEMIC EXPOSURE TO THE DRUG AND RELATED TOXIC SIDE EFFECTS, BEFORE THE FILTERED BLOOD IS RETURNED TO THE PATIENT\u2019S CIRCULATORY SYSTEM.  PHP THERAPY IS PERFORMED IN AN INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY SUITE IN APPROXIMATELY TWO TO THREE HOURS. PATIENTS REMAIN IN AN INTENSIVE CARE OR STEP-DOWN UNIT OVERNIGHT FOR OBSERVATION FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURE. TREATMENT WITH CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS IS REPEATABLE, AND A NEW DISPOSABLE SYSTEM IS USED FOR EACH TREATMENT. PATIENTS TREATED IN CLINICAL SETTINGS ARE PERMITTED UP TO SIX TREATMENTS. IN COMMERCIAL TREATMENT SETTINGS, PATIENTS HAVE RECEIVED UP TO EIGHT TREATMENTS. IN THE UNITED STATES, MELPHALAN HYDROCHLORIDE FOR INJECTION WILL BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE SYSTEM, IF APPROVED. IN EUROPE, THE SYSTEM IS SOLD SEPARATELY AND USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MELPHALAN HYDROCHLORIDE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FROM A THIRD PARTY. IN OUR CLINICAL TRIALS, MELPHALAN HYDROCHLORIDE FOR INJECTION IS PROVIDED TO BOTH EUROPEAN AND UNITED STATES CLINICAL TRIAL SITES.  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS PROCEDURE  AS WITH MANY CANCER THERAPIES, TREATMENT WITH CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS IS ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE EVENTS, SOME OF WHICH CAN BE POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING.  PROCEDUR  E AND PRODUCT REFINEMENTS  19  I  N 2012  ,  WE INTRODUCED THE GENERATION TWO VERSION OF THE CHEMOSAT SYSTEM, WHICH OFFERED IMPROVED HEMOFILTRATION AND OTHER  DEVICE COMPONENT  PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS.  REPORTS FROM TREATING PHYSICIANS IN BOTH EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES  USING THE GENERATION TWO CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS  ,  IN A COMMERCIAL SETTING  ,  HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THESE PRODUCT IMPROVEMENTS AND PROCEDURE REFINEMENTS HAVE IMPROVED THE SAFETY PROFILE.  SINCE  2017, PHYSICIANS IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES  HAVE  PRESENTED  AND PUBLISHED  THE RESULTS OF RESEARCH THAT SIGNALED AN IMPROVED SAFETY PROFILE  ,  AS WELL AS EFFICACY IN MULTIPLE TUMOR TYPES.  COLLECTION OF ADEQUATE SAFETY DATA ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROCEDURE IS A MAJOR FOCUS OF THE CLINICAL TRIALS IN OUR CURRENT CDP.  PRI  OR UNITED STATES REGULATORY EXPERIENCE  IN AUGUST 2012 WE SUBMITTED A NEW DRUG APPLICATION (\u201cNDA\u201d) UNDER SECTION 505(B)(2) OF THE FEDERAL FOOD DRUG COSMETIC ACT (FFDCA) SEEKING AN INDICATION FOR THE PERCUTANEOUS INTRA-ARTERIAL ADMINISTRATION OF MELPHALAN FOR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC MELANOMA IN THE LIVER, SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED TO OCULAR MELANOMA METASTATIC TO THE LIVER. DATA SUBMITTED TO THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) INCLUDED THE EARLY CLINICAL TRIAL VERSIONS OF THE SYSTEM, ALONG WITH EARLY CLINICAL PROCEDURE TECHNIQUES BASED ON RESEARCH CONDUCTED BETWEEN 2005 AND 2010. A FULL DISCOURSE OF THIS NDA SUBMISSION, INCLUDING THE OUTCOME OF AN ODAC PANEL ON MAY 2, 2013 AND THE FDA\u2019S ISSUANCE OF A COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER, IN SEPTEMBER 2013, IS PROVIDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  ACTIVE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  THE FOCUS OF OUR CDP IS TO GENERATE CLINICAL DATA FOR THE CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS IN VARIOUS DISEASE STATES AND VALIDATE THE SAFETY PROFILE OF THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE PRODUCT AND TREATMENT PROCEDURE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE IMPROVEMENTS WE HAVE MADE TO CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS AND TO THE PHP THERAPY HAVE ADDRESSED THE ADVERSE EVENT PROFILE AND PROCEDURE-RELATED RIS  KS OBSERVED DURING PREVIOUS PHASE 2 AND 3 CLINICAL TRIALS. OUR CDP IS ALSO DESIGNED TO SUPPORT CLINICAL ADOPTION OF AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR CHEMOSAT IN EUROPE, AND TO SUPPORT REGULATORY APPROVALS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES.  THE FOCUS TRIAL -  NCT02678572  ON JULY 27, 2018, AFTER EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH FDA, WE ANNOUNCED AN AMENDMENT TO OUR PHASE 3, RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL IN OCULAR MELANOMA LIVER METASTASES WHICH ALTERED THE TRIAL PROTOCOL TO A NON-RANDOMIZED, SINGLE-ARM STUDY. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AMENDMENT, THE TRIAL, NOW TITLED  A SINGLE-ARM, MULTI-CENTER, OPEN-LABEL STUDY TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY, SAFETY AND PHARMACOKINETICS OF MELPHALAN/HDS TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH HEPATIC-DOMINANT OCULAR MELANOMA  , WILL ENROLL A MINIMUM OF 80 PATIENTS WITH OCULAR MELANOMA METASTATIC TO THE LIVER. UNDER THE NEW PROTOCOL, THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT FOR THE AMENDED FOCUS TRIAL WILL BE OBJECTIVE RESPONSE RATE (\u201cORR\u201d). SECONDARY ENDPOINTS WILL INCLUDE DURATION OF RESPONSE, DISEASE CONTROL RATE, OVERALL SURVIVAL AND PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL. ADDITIONAL EXPLORATORY OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDE TIME TO OBJECTIVE RESPONSE, HEPATIC PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL, HEPATIC OBJECTIVE RESPONSE, AND QUALITY OF LIFE, SAFETY AND OTHER PHARMACOKINETIC MEASURES. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA REMAIN UNCHANGED. PATIENTS PREVIOUSLY ENROLLED IN THE MELPHALAN/HDS ARM OF THE TRIAL UNDER THE PREVIOUS PROTOCOL WILL CONTINUE TO BE TREATED AND STATISTICALLY EVALUATED AS PART OF THE AMENDED TRIAL.  THE RARITY OF OCULAR MELANOMA, ABSENCE OF CROSSOVER TO THE EXPERIMENTAL TRIAL ARM, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF PHP  \u00ae  THERAPY IN A COMMERCIAL SETTING IN EUROPE HAVE ALL COMBINED TO IMPEDE ENROLLMENT IN THIS TRIAL UNDER ITS PREVIOUS PROTOCOL. THIS AMENDMENT WAS INTENDED TO ACCELERATE OUR TIMELINE TO COMPLETE TRIAL ENROLLMENT WHILE PROVIDING A STRONG SCIENTIFIC CASE TO SUPPORT AN APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL.  HOWEVER, ACCRUAL OF NEW PATIENTS IN THIS TRIAL SLOWED DUE TO THE CASH LIMITATIONS WE OPERATED UNDER IN RECENT MONTHS. WITH THE NEW CAPITAL INVESTMENT WE ANNOUNCED ON JULY 11, 2019 WE BELIEVE WE CAN COMPLETE PATIENT ENROLLMENT IN THIS TRIAL DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2019.  THE AMENDMENT INVALIDATED THE PRIOR SPECIAL PROTOCOL ASSESSMENT (\u201cSPA\u201d) AGREEMENT FOR THE PRIOR VERSION OF THE TRIAL. FULL DETAILS OF THE REGISTRATION PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL ARE AVAILABLE AT WWW.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV.  THE FOCUS TRIAL IS BEING CONDUCTED AT LEADING CANCER CENTERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE. THE MOFFITT CANCER CENTER IN TAMPA, FLORIDA WAS ACTIVATED AS A PARTICIPATING CENTER IN JANUARY 2016 WITH JONATHAN ZAGER, M.D., FACS, PROFESSOR OF SURGERY IN THE CUTANEOUS ONCOLOGY AND SARCOMA DEPARTMENTS AND A SENIOR MEMBER AT MOFFITT CANCER CENTER, SERVING AS THE TRIAL'S LEAD INVESTIGATOR. IN OCTOBER 2018, WE ANNOUNCED CONT  INUED ROLLOUT OF THE AMENDED PROTOCOL TO PARTICIPATING CENTERS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND EXPECT APPROXIMATELY 30 LEADING CANCER CENTERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRIAL.  WE BELIEVE THAT OCULAR MELANOMA LIVER METASTASES REPRESENT  A SIGNIFICANT UNMET MEDICAL NEED, AND THAT PURSUIT OF AN INDICATION IN THIS DISEASE STATE REPRESENTS THE FASTEST PATH TO POTENTIAL MARKETING APPROVAL OF THE MELPHALAN/HDS IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE ALIGN TRIAL -  NCT03086993  20  IN APRIL 2018 WE ANNOUNCED THE IN  ITIATION OF A NEW PIVOTAL TRIAL OF MELPHALAN/HDS TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH ICC TITLED  A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED STUDY TO COMPARE THE EFFICACY, SAFETY AND PHARMACOKINETICS OF MELPHALAN/HDS TREATMENT GIVEN SEQUENTIALLY FOLLOWING CISPLATIN/GEMCITABINE VERSUS CISP  LATIN/GEMCITABINE (STANDARD OF CARE) IN PATIENTS WITH INTRAHEPATIC CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA (THE ALIGN TRIAL)  .   THE ALIGN TRIAL IS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER A SPA ANNOUNCED IN MARCH OF 2017.  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SPA, THE ALIGN TRIAL WILL ENROLL APPROXIMATELY 295  ICC PATIENTS AT APPROXIMATELY 40 CLINICAL SITES IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE.  THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT IS OVERALL SURVIVAL (  \u201c  OS  \u201d  ) AND SECONDARY AND EXPLORATORY ENDPOINTS INCLUDE SAFETY, PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL (  \u201c  PFS  \u201d  ), ORR AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE MEASURES. THE ALIGN  TRIAL IS DESIGNED TO BE COST EFFECTIVE AND PURSUED IN A FINANCIALLY PRUDENT MANNER WHEN FINANCIAL RESOURCES PERMIT. THE SPA AGREEMENT FOR THE ALIGN TRIAL INDICATES THAT THE PIVOTAL TRIAL DESIGN ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES OBJECTIVES THAT, IF MET, WOULD SUPPORT R  EGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR APPROVAL OF MELPHALAN/HDS IN ICC.  HOWEVER, FINAL DETERMINATIONS FOR MARKETING APPLICATION APPROVAL ARE MADE BY FDA AFTER A COMPLETE REVIEW OF A MARKETING APPLICATION AND ARE BASED ON THE TOTALITY OF DATA IN THE APPLICATION.  IN OCTOBER 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THE ENROLLMENT OF THE FIRST PATIENT IN THE ALIGN TRIAL  AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER, METHODIST UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, AND WEST CANCER CENTER  IN MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE.  PHASE 2 HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA (HCC) & IN  TRAHEPATIC CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA (ICC) PROGRAM  IN 2014 WE INITIATED A PHASE 2 CLINICAL TRIAL PROGRAM IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES, WITH THE GOAL OF OBTAINING AN EFFICACY AND SAFETY SIGNAL FOR MELPHALAN/HDS IN THE TREATMENT OF HCC AND ICC. DUE TO DIFFERENCE  S IN TREATMENT PRACTICE PATTERNS BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES, WE ESTABLISHED SEPARATE EUROPEAN AND UNITED STATES TRIAL PROTOCOLS FOR THE HCC PHASE 2 PROGRAM WITH DIFFERENT INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION PATIENT SELECTION CRITERIA.  PROTOCOL 201  NCT02406508  \u2013 CONDUCTED IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS TRIAL WAS INTENDED TO ASSESS THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF MELPHALAN/HDS FOLLOWED BY SORAFENIB.  THIS TRIAL WAS TERMINATED EARLIER THAN PLANNED AND IS NOW CLOSED TO ENROLLMENT.  PROTOCOL 202 NCT02415036  \u2013 CONDUCTED IN EUROPE, THIS TRIAL WAS INTENDED TO ASSESS THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF MELPHALAN/HDS WITHOUT SORAFENIB. THE TRIAL WILL ALSO EVALUATE OVERALL RESPONSE RATE VIA MRECIST CRITERIA, PROGRESSION FREE SURVIVAL, CHARACTERIZE THE SYSTEMIC EXPOSURE OF MELPHALAN AND ASSESS PATIENT QUALITY OF LIFE.  THIS TRIAL WAS TERMINATED EARLIER THAN PLANNED AND IS NOW CLOSED TO ENROLLMENT.  ICC COHORT  \u2013 IN 2015 WE EXPANDED  PROTOCOL 202  TO INCLUDE A COHORT OF PATIENTS WITH ICC. THE TRIAL FOR THIS COHORT WAS CONDUCTED AT THE SAME CENTERS PARTICIPATING IN THE PHASE 2 HCC TRIAL.  THIS TRIAL HAS COMPLETED ENROLLMENT AND DATA FROM THIS STUDY ARE BEING ANALYZED AND WILL BE DISSEMINATED PUBLICLY BY THE INVESTIGATORS.  ICC RETROSPECTIVE DATA COLLECTION  - THE ORIGINAL GOAL TO OBTAIN AN EFFICACY SIGNAL FOR THE PHASE 2 ICC COHORT HAS BEEN SATISFIED BY THE RESULT OF MULTICENTER PATIENT OUTCOMES IDENTIFIED IN THE RETROSPECTIVE DATA COLLECTION OF OUR COMMERCIAL ICC CASES CONDUCTED BY OUR EUROPEAN INVESTIGATORS. THESE PROMISING OUTCOMES AND OBSERVATIONS WERE DISCUSSED WITH KEY OPINION LEADERS AT A DELCATH-ORGANIZED MEDICAL ADVISORY PANEL MEETING AND LED TO THE AGREEMENT THAT PHP THERAPY DOES \u201cDEMONSTRATE AN EFFICACY SIGNAL IN ICC AND IS WORTHY OF FULL CLINICAL INVESTIGATION.\u201d DATA FROM THIS RETROSPECTIVE DATA COLLECTION PROVIDED IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT DURING OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE FDA FOR OUR SPA FOR THE PIVOTAL ICC TRIAL. DATA FOR THE RETROSPECTIVE DATA COLLECTION WERE PUBLISHED IN EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY IN A PAPER TITLED \u201cPERCUTANEOUS HEPATIC PERFUSION (CHEMOSATURATION) WITH MELPHALAN IN PATIENTS WITH INTRAHEPATIC CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA: EUROPEAN MULTICENTRE STUDY ON SAFETY, SHORT TERM EFFECTS AND SURVIVAL\u201d.  DETAILS OF THE FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY ARE DISCUSSED BELOW UNDER \u201cRECENT DATA PRESENTATIONS\u201d.  WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF IDENTIFYING AN EFFICACY SIGNAL WORTHY OF FURTHER CLINICAL  INVESTIGATION NOW MET, WE HAVE TERMINATED ENROLLMENT IN OUR PHASE 2 PROGRAM AND HAVE CLOSED THE PHASE 2 TRIALS IN ORDER TO FOCUS AVAILABLE RESOURCES ON THE FOCUS TRIAL AND THE ALIGN TRIAL.  CLINICAL TRIALS ARE LONG, EXPENSIVE AND HIGHLY UNCERTAIN PROCESSES AND FAILURE CAN UNEXPECTEDLY OCCUR AT ANY STAGE OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. THE START OR END OF A CLINICAL TRIAL IS OFTEN DELAYED OR HALTED DUE TO CHANGING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, MANUFACTURING CHALLENGES, REQUIRED CLINICAL TRIAL ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS, SLOWER THAN ANTICIPATED PATIENT ENROLLMENT, CHANGING STANDARDS OF CARE, AVAILABILITY OR PREVALENCE OF USE OF A COMPARATOR TREATMENT OR REQUIRED PRIOR THERAPY. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING EXPENSES CONSIST OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH ITS CLINICAL TRIALS. SEE THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  EUROPEAN INVESTIGATOR INITIATED TRIALS  IN ADDITION TO THE CLINICAL TRIALS IN OUR CDP, WE ARE SUPPORTING DATA GENERATION IN OTHER AREAS. WE ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING ONE IIT IN COLORECTAL CARCINOMA METASTATIC TO THE LIVER (\u201cMCRC\u201d) AT LEIDEN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER IN THE NETHERLANDS.   WE CONTINUE TO  21  EVALUA  TE OTHER IITS AS SUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES PRESENT IN EUROPE. WE BELIEVE IITS WILL SERVE TO BUILD CLINICAL EXPERIENCE AT KEY CANCER CENTERS AND WILL HELP SUPPORT EFFORTS TO OBTAIN FULL REIMBURSEMENT IN EUROPE.  EUROPEAN CLINICAL DATA GENERATION  ON APRIL 2, 2015, WE ANNOUNCED THE ACTIVATION OF OUR PROSPECTIVE PATIENT REGISTRY IN EUROPE TO COLLECT UNIFORM ESSENTIAL PATIENT SAFETY, EFFICACY, AND QOL INFORMATION USING OBSERVATIONAL STUDY METHODS. THIS REGISTRY WILL GATHER DATA IN MULTIPLE TUMOR TYPES FROM COMMERCIAL CASES PERFORMED BY PARTICIPATING CANCER CENTERS IN EUROPE.  A PROSPECTIVE REGISTRY IS AN ORGANIZED SYSTEM THAT USES OBSERVATIONAL STUDY METHODS TO COLLECT DEFINED CLINICAL DATA UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS OF USE TO EVALUATE SPECIFIED OUTCOMES FOR A POPULATION DEFINED BY A PARTICULAR DISEASE, CONDITION, OR EXPOSURE.  REGISTRY DATA IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUPPORTIVE DATA AND, AS SUCH, CANNOT BE USED FOR EITHER REGISTRATION APPROVAL, PROMOTIONAL OR COMPETITIVE CLAIMS.  HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THE PATIENT REGISTRY WILL PROVIDE A VALUABLE SUPPORTIVE DATA REPOSITORY THAT CONTAINS REAL-WORLD EVIDENCE, FROM A COMMERCIAL SETTING, THAT CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY FURTHER CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES, SUPPORT CLINICAL ADOPTION AND REIMBURSEMENT IN EUROPE.  RECE  NT DATA PRESENTATIONS  IN APRIL 2019 WE ANNOUNCED THAT RESULTS FROM A PROSPECTIVE PHASE 2 STUDY CONDUCTED BY LEIDEN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER (\u201cLUMC\u201d) IN THE NETHERLANDS ON THE USE OF CHEMOSAT TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC OCULAR MELANOMA WITH LIVER METASTASES WERE PRESENTED AT THE EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON INTERVENTIONAL ONCOLOGY ANNUAL MEETING.  THE LUMC STUDY TITLED \u201cPERCUTANEOUS HEPATIC PERFUSION WITH MELPHALAN IN PATIENTS WITH UNRESECTABLE LIVER METASTASES FROM OCULAR MELANOMA USING THE DELCATH SYSTEM'S SECOND-GENERATION HEMOFILTRATION SYSTEM: A PROSPECTIVE PHASE II STUDY\u201d WAS CONDUCTED BY A TEAM LED AND PRESENTED BY DR. MARK BURGMANS. THE STUDY EVALUATED 35 PATIENTS WITH UNRESECTABLE LIVER METASTASES FROM OCULAR MELANOMA TREATED WITH CHEMOSAT BETWEEN FEBRUARY 2014 AND JUNE 2017. THE 35 PATIENTS UNDERWENT A TOTAL OF 72 PHP THERAPY TREATMENTS, AND TUMOR RESPONSE WAS EVALUABLE IN 32 PATIENTS. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS WERE OVERALL RESPONSE, OVERALL SURVIVAL, AND PROGRESSION FREE SURVIVAL. SECONDARY MEASURES INCLUDED SAFETY MEASURES AND HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITY.  RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOWED THAT ONE PATIENT HAD A COMPLETE RESPONSE AND 22 HAD PARTIAL RESPONSE, FOR A COMBINED OVERALL RESPONSE RATE OF 74.1%. OVERALL SURVIVAL WAS 20.3 MONTHS AND MEAN PROGRESSION FREE SURVIVAL WAS 8.1 MONTHS.  SAFETY ANALYSIS SHOWED A TOTAL OF 14 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE RECORDED. THE HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITIES WERE IN A MAJORITY OF THE CASES SELF-LIMITING AND MANAGEABLE. INVESTIGATORS CONCLUDED THAT \u201cPHP THERAPY WITH THE GENERATION TWO VERSION OF CHEMOSAT IS AN EFFECTIVE AND SAFE TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH HEPATIC METASTASES FROM OCULAR MELANOMA.\u201d  THE PRESENTATION AT THE EUROPEAN CONFERENCE, AN INTERVENTIONAL ONCOLOGY UPDATED DATA PREVIOUSLY PRESENTED AT THE 2018 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR AND INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF EUROPE.  MARKET ACCESS AND COMMERCIAL CLINICAL ADOPTION  EUROPE  DELCATH\u2019S EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARY, DELCATH SYSTEMS, LTD., IS HEADQUARTERED IN GALWAY, IRELAND.  OUR MARKETING STRATEGY IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (THE \u201cEEA\u201d) INCLUDES ESTABLISHING STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH PARTNERS THAT INCLUDE LICENSE, SUPPLY, SALES AND MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS.  IN DECEMBER 2018, DELCATH ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE LICENSING AGREEMENT (THE \u201cMEDAC LICENSE\u201d) FOR CHEMOSAT COMMERCIALIZATION IN EUROPE WITH MEDAC GESELLSCHAFT FU\u0308R KLINISCHE SPEZIALPRA\u0308PARATE MBH (\u201cMEDAC\u201d), A PRIVATELY HELD, MULTI-NATIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY BASED IN WEDEL, GERMANY. FOUNDED IN 1970, MEDAC SPECIALIZES IN THE TREATMENT AND DIAGNOSIS OF ONCOLOGICAL, UROLOGICAL AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. MEDAC HAS OFFICES GLOBALLY, WORLDWIDE PARTNER AGREEMENTS IN OVER 90 COUNTRIES, AND APPROXIMATELY 1,200 EMPLOYEES.  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MEDAC LICENSE, DELCATH SYSTEMS, LTD. EXCLUSIVELY LICENSES TO MEDAC THE RIGHT TO SELL AND MARKET CHEMOSAT IN ALL MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, NORWAY, LIECHTENSTEIN, SWITZERLAND, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE MEDAC LICENSE PROVIDES FOR PAYMENT BY MEDAC TO DELCATH IN A COMBINATION OF UPFRONT AND SUCCESS-BASED MILESTONE PAYMENTS AS WELL AS A FIXED TRANSFER PRICE PER UNIT OF CHEMOSAT AND SPECIFIED ROYALTIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT MEDAC IS A WELL-SUITED PARTNER TO HELP ADVANCE CHEMOSAT COMMERCIALIZATION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. MEDAC HAS OFFICES THROUGHOUT EUROPE, A WELL-ESTABLISHED NETWORK AMONG ONCOLOGY K  EY OPINION LEADERS, AND ORGANIZATIONAL SCALE NECESSARY TO HELP ESTABLISH CHEMOSAT IN THE EUROPEAN TREATMENT LANDSCAPE FOR CANCERS OF THE LIVER.  22  SINCE LAUNCHING CHEMOSAT IN EUROPE,  OVER  700  COMMERCIAL TREATMENTS HAVE BEE  N PERFORMED AT OVER 25 LEADING EUROPEAN CANCER CENTERS. PHYSICIANS IN EUROPE HAVE USED CHEMOSAT TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH A VARIETY OF CANCERS IN THE LIVER, PRIMARILY OCULAR MELANOMA LIVER METASTASES, AND OTHER TUMOR TYPES, INCLUDING CUTANEOUS MELANOMA, HEPAT  OCELLULAR CARCINOMA, CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA, AND LIVER METASTASES FROM COLORECTAL CANCER, BREAST, PANCREATIC AND NEUROENDOCRINE.  IN 2017, WE ANNOUNCED OUR FIRST PATIENT TO RECEIVE EIGHT CHEMOSAT TREATMENTS, AND HAVE SEEN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF REPEAT TREATMENT  S PERFORMED ON A PER PATIENT BASIS CONSISTENTLY INCREASE.  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WE  CONTINUED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH MEDAC ON ADVANCEMENT OF THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF CHEMOSAT IN EUROPE. MEDAC HAS REMAINED SUPPORTIVE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR AND IS CONFIDENT IN THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHEMOSAT IN EUROPE.  EUROPEAN REIMBURSEMENT  A CRITICAL DRIVER OF UTILIZATION GROWTH FOR CHEMOSAT IN EUROPE IS THE EXPANSION OF REIMBURSEMENT MECHANISMS FOR THE PROCEDURE IN OUR PRIORITY MARKETS. IN EUROPE, THERE IS NO CENTRALIZED PAN-EUROPEAN MEDICAL DEVICE REIMBURSEMENT BODY. REIMBURSEMENT IS ADMINISTERED ON A REGIONAL AND NATIONAL BASIS. MEDICAL DEVICES ARE TYPICALLY REIMBURSED UNDER DIAGNOSIS RELATED GROUPS (\u201cDRG\u201d) AS PART OF A PROCEDURE.  PRIOR TO OBTAINING PERMANENT DRG REIMBURSEMENT CODES, IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, WE ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING INTERIM REIMBURSEMENT FROM EXISTING MECHANISMS THAT INCLUDE SPECIFIC INTERIM REIMBURSEMENT SCHEMES, NEW TECHNOLOGY PAYMENT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS EXISTING DRG CODES. IN MOST EU COUNTRIES, THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES HEALTHCARE AND CONTROLS REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS. SINCE THE EU HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT OR PRICING MATTERS IN ITS MEMBER STATES, THE METHODOLOGI  ES FOR DETERMINING REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND THE ACTUAL RATES MAY VARY BY COUNTRY.  EFFECTIVE WITH THE EXECUTION OF OUR LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH MEDAC, MEDAC WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR REIMBURSEMENT APPLICATIONS IN THE EUROPEAN MARKETS COVERED BY OUR AGREEMENT.  GERMANY  IN OCTOBER 2015, WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE INSTITUT F\u03a5\u0308R DAS ENTGELTSYSTEM IM KRANKENHAUS (INEK), THE GERMAN FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT AGENCY, ESTABLISHED A NATIONAL ZUSATZENTGELD (ZE) REIMBURSEMENT CODE FOR PROCEDURES PERFORMED WITH CHEMOSAT IN GERMANY. THE ZE DIAGNOSTIC-RELATED GROUP (DRG) CODE IS A NATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT CODE THAT AUGMENTS EXISTING DRG CODES UNTIL A SPECIFIC NEW DRG CODE CAN BE CREATED AND WILL REPLACE THE PREVIOUS NEUE UNTERSUCHUNGS UND BEHANDLUNGSMETHODEN (NUB) PROCEDURE THAT REQUIRED PATIENTS IN GERMANY TO APPLY INDIVIDUALLY FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF THEIR CHEMOSAT TREATMENT.  WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A ZE CODE FOR CHEMOSAT, THE PROCEDURE IS NOW PERMANENTLY REPRESENTED IN THE DRG CATALOG IN GERMANY. COVERAGE LEVELS UNDER THIS PROCESS ARE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN HOSPITALS IN GERMANY AND REGIONAL SICKNESS FUNDS, WITH COVERAGE LEVELS RENEGOTIATED ANNUALLY.  UNITED KINGDOM  IN MAY 2014, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR CLINICAL EXCELLENCE (\u201cNICE\u201d), A NON-DEPARTMENTAL PUBLIC BODY THAT PROVIDES GUIDANCE AND ADVICE TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE IN THE UK, COMPLETED A CLINICAL REVIEW OF CHEMOSAT. THE NICE REVIEW INDICATED THAT AS THE CURRENT BODY OF EVIDENCE ON THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF PHP WITH CHEMOSAT FOR PRIMARY OR METASTATIC LIVER CANCER IS LIMITED, THE PROCEDURE SHOULD BE PERFORMED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF RESEARCH BY CLINICIANS WITH SPECIFIC TRAINING IN ITS USE AND TECHNIQUES.  DELCATH EXPECTS TO CONSULT AGAIN WITH THE INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURES ADVISORY COMMITTEE AT NICE IN ENGLAND, TO PROVIDE RECENT  CLINICAL EVIDENCE WITH A VIEW TO MOVING EXISTING INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURAL GUIDANCE FROM RESEARCH TO SPECIALIST STATUS.  MEDAC WILL CONTINUE CONSULTATIONS BEGUN BY DELCATH WITH THE INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURES ADVISORY COMMITTEE AT NICE IN ENGLAND, PROVIDING RECENT CLINICAL EVIDENCE WITH A VIEW TO MOVING EXISTING INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURAL GUIDANCE FROM A RESEARCH RECOMMENDATION TO SPECIALIST RECOMMENDATION. THIS WOULD ENABLE GREATER SCOPE FOR COMMERCIALIZATION ACCESS TO THE THERAPY BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW MORE USE BY NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE (\u201cNHS\u201d) CLINICIANS OF THE THERAPY. IT MIGHT ALSO PAVE THE WAY FOR A FULL MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT AS A WAY TOWARDS LONGER TERM REIMBURSEMENT WITHIN THE NHS.  IN THE SHORT TERM, PUBLIC PATIENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE TREATED IN THE UK THROUGH CLINICAL TRIALS. PRIVATE PATIENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE TREATED THROUGH THE ESTABLISHED PRIVATE TREATMENT PATHWAY SUCH AS PRIVATE INSURANCE COVERAGE OR SELF-PAY.  NETHERLANDS  IN THE NETHERLANDS CHEMOSAT HAS BEEN PERFORMED AT THE NETHERLANDS CANCER INSTITUTE IN 2013 AND AT LEIDEN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTRE SINCE 2014. IN JUNE 2017 THE MEDICAL ONCOLOGY NATIONAL TREATMENT GUIDELINES FOR UVEAL MELANOMA WERE UPDATED AND NOW INCLUDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONSIDER CHEMOSAT IN THE TREATMENT OF LIVER METASTASES. WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL GUIDELINES AND THE SUPPORT OF CLINICIANS TREATING PATIENTS WITH CHEMOSAT WILL SUPPORT AN APPLICATION FOR REIMBURSEMENT IN THIS MARKET.  23  REGULATORY STATUS  OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND RIGOROUS GOVERNMENT REGULATION BY FOREIGN REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE FDA. FOREIGN REGULATORY AGENCIES, THE FDA AND COMPARABLE REGULATORY AGENCIES IN STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IMPOSE EXTENSIVE REQUIREMENTS UPON THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, PRE-MARKET CLEARANCE AND APPROVAL, MANUFACTURING, LABELING, MARKETING, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION, PRICING, STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL DEVICE PRODUCTS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE FOREIGN REGULATORY AGENCY OR FDA REQUIREMENTS MAY RESULT IN WARNING LETTERS, FINES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES, SUSPENSION OR DELAYS IN CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, RECALL OR SEIZURE OF PRODUCTS, PARTIAL OR TOTAL SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION OR WITHDRAWAL OF A PRODUCT FROM THE MARKET.  UNITED STATES REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT  IN THE UNITED STATES, THE FDA REGULATES DRUG AND DEVICE PRODUCTS UNDER THE FFDCA, AND ITS IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS. THE DELCATH MELPHALAN/HDS IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION AS A COMBINATION PRODUCT, WHICH MEANS IT IS COMPOSED OF BOTH A DRUG PRODUCT AND DEVICE PRODUCT. IF MARKETED INDIVIDUALLY, EACH COMPONENT WOULD THEREFORE BE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT REGULATORY PATHWAYS AND REVIEWED BY DIFFERENT CENTERS WITHIN THE FDA. A COMBINATION PRODUCT, HOWEVER, IS ASSIGNED TO A CENTER THAT WILL HAVE PRIMARY JURISDICTION OVER ITS PRE-MARKET REVIEW AND REGULATION BASED ON A DETERMINATION OF ITS PRIMARY MODE OF ACTION, WHICH IS THE SINGLE MODE OF ACTION THAT PROVIDES THE MOST IMPORTANT THERAPEUTIC ACTION. IN THE CASE OF THE MELPHALAN/HDS, THE PRIMARY MODE OF ACTION IS ATTRIBUTABL  E TO THE DRUG COMPONENT OF THE PRODUCT, WHICH MEANS THAT THE CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION AND RESEARCH, HAS PRIMARY JURISDICTION OVER ITS PRE-MARKET DEVELOPMENT AND REVIEW.  THE PROCESS REQUIRED BY THE FDA BEFORE DRUG PRODUCT CANDIDATES MAY BE MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES GENERALLY INVOLVES THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  SUBMISSION TO THE FDA OF AN IND, WHICH MUST BECOME EFFECTIVE BEFORE HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS MAY BEGIN AND MUST BE UPDATED PERIODICALLY, BUT AT LEAST ANNUALLY;  \u2022  COMPLETION OF EXTENSIVE PRECLINICAL LABORATORY TESTS AND PRECLINICAL ANIMAL STUDIES, ALL PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FDA\u2019S GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICE, OR GLP, REGULATIONS;  \u2022  PERFORMANCE OF ADEQUATE AND WELL-CONTROLLED HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS TO ESTABLISH THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE PRODUCT CANDIDATE FOR EACH PROPOSED INDICATION;  \u2022  SUBMISSION TO THE FDA OF AN NDA AFTER COMPLETION OF ALL PIVOTAL CLINICAL TRIALS;  \u2022  A DETERMINATION BY THE FDA WITHIN 60 DAYS OF ITS RECEIPT OF AN NDA TO FILE THE NDA FOR REVIEW;  \u2022  SATISFACTORY COMPLETION OF AN FDA PRE-APPROVAL INSPECTION OF THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AT WHICH THE PRODUCT IS PRODUCED AND TESTED TO ASSESS COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE, OR CGMP, REGULATIONS; AND  \u2022  FDA REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF AN NDA PRIOR TO ANY COMMERCIAL MARKETING OR SALE OF THE DRUG IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL PROCESS REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL TIME, EFFORT AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES, AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT ANY APPROVALS FOR OUR PRODUCT WILL BE GRANTED ON A TIMELY B  ASIS, IF AT ALL.  THE RESULTS OF PRECLINICAL TESTS (WHICH INCLUDE LABORATORY EVALUATION AS WELL AS GLP STUDIES TO EVALUATE TOXICITY IN ANIMALS) FOR A PARTICULAR PRODUCT CANDIDATE, TOGETHER WITH RELATED MANUFACTURING INFORMATION AND ANALYTICAL DATA, ARE SUBMITTED AS PART OF AN IND TO THE FDA. THE IND AUTOMATICALLY BECOMES EFFECTIVE 30 DAYS AFTER RECEIPT BY THE FDA, UNLESS THE FDA, WITHIN THE 30-DAY TIME PERIOD, RAISES CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONDUCT OF THE PROPOSED CLINICAL TRIAL, INCLUDING CONCERNS THAT HUMAN RESEARCH SUBJECTS WILL BE EXPOSED TO UNREASONABLE HEALTH RISKS. IN SUCH A CASE, THE IND SPONSOR AND THE FDA MUST RESOLVE ANY OUTSTANDING CONCERNS BEFORE THE CLINICAL TRIAL CAN BEGIN. IND SUBMISSIONS MAY NOT RESULT IN FDA AUTHORIZATION TO COMMENCE A CLINICAL TRIAL. A SEPARATE SUBMISSION TO AN EXISTING IND MUST ALSO BE MADE FOR EACH SUCCESSIVE CLINICAL TRIAL CONDUCTED DURING PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. FURTHER, AN INDEPENDENT INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD, OR IRB, FOR EACH MEDICAL CENTER PROPOSING TO CONDUCT THE CLINICAL TRIAL MUST REVIEW AND APPROVE THE PLAN FOR ANY CLINICAL TRIAL BEFORE IT COMMENCES AT THAT CENTER AND IT MUST MONITOR THE STUDY UNTIL COMPLETED. THE FDA, THE IRB OR THE SPONSOR  24  MAY SUSPEND A CLINICAL TRIAL AT ANY TIME ON VARIOUS GROUNDS, INCLUD  ING A FINDING THAT THE SUBJECTS OR PATIENTS ARE BEING EXPOSED TO AN UNACCEPTABLE HEALTH RISK. CLINICAL TESTING ALSO MUST SATISFY EXTENSIVE GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE REGULATIONS AND REGULATIONS FOR INFORMED CONSENT AND PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFO  RMATION. SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES IND ARE REQUIRED IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE MAY CONDUCT CLINICAL TRIALS.  CLINICAL TRIALS  FOR PURPOSES OF NDA SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL, CLINICAL TRIALS ARE TYPICALLY CONDUCTED IN THE FOLLOWING SEQUENTIAL PHASES, WHICH MAY OVERLAP.  \u2022  PHASE 1 CLINICAL TRIALS. STUDIES ARE INITIALLY CONDUCTED IN A LIMITED POPULATION TO TEST THE PRODUCT CANDIDATE FOR SAFETY, DOSE TOLERANCE, ABSORPTION, DISTRIBUTION, METABOLISM AND EXCRETION, TYPICALLY IN HEALTHY HUMANS, BUT IN SOME CASES IN PATIENTS.  \u2022  PHASE 2 CLINICAL TRIALS. STUDIES ARE GENERALLY CONDUCTED IN A LIMITED PATIENT POPULATION TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS AND SAFETY RISKS, EXPLORE THE INITIAL EFFICACY OF THE PRODUCT FOR SPECIFIC TARGETED INDICATIONS AND TO DETERMINE DOSE RANGE OR PHARMACODYNAMICS. MULTIPLE PHASE 2 CLINICAL TRIALS MAY BE CONDUCTED BY THE SPONSOR TO OBTAIN INFORMATION PRIOR TO BEGINNING LARGER AND MORE EXPENSIVE PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIALS.  \u2022  PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIALS. THESE ARE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS PIVOTAL STUDIES. WHEN PHASE 2 EVALUATIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT A DOSE RANGE OF THE PRODUCT IS EFFECTIVE AND HAS AN ACCEPTABLE SAFETY PROFILE, PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIALS ARE UNDERTAKEN IN LARGE PATIENT POPULATIONS TO FURTHER EVALUATE DOSAGE, PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF CLINICAL EFFICACY AND FURTHER TEST FOR SAFETY IN AN EXPANDED AND DIVERSE PATIENT POPULATION AT MULTIPLE, GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED CLINICAL TRIAL CENTERS.  \u2022  PHASE 4 CLINICAL TRIALS. THE FDA MAY APPROVE AN NDA FOR A PRODUCT CANDIDATE, BUT REQUIRE THAT THE SPONSOR CONDUCT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS TO FURTHER ASSESS THE DRUG AFTER NDA APPROVAL UNDER A POST-APPROVAL COMMITMENT. IN ADDITION, A SPONSOR MAY DECIDE TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS AFTER THE FDA HAS APPROVED AN NDA. POST-APPROVAL TRIALS ARE TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS PHASE 4 CLINICAL TRIALS.  SPONSORS OF CLINICAL TRIALS MAY SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR THE DESIGN, EXECUTION, AND ANALYSIS FOR THEIR PIVOTAL TRIALS UNDER A SPA. A SPA IS AN EVALUATION BY THE FDA OF A PROTOCOL WITH THE GOAL OF REACHING AN AGREEMENT THAT THE PHASE 3 TRIAL PROTOCOL DESIGN, CLINICAL ENDPOINTS, AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES ARE ACCEPTABLE TO SUPPORT REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE DRUG PRODUCT CANDIDATE WITH RESPECT TO EFFECTIVENESS FOR THE INDICATION STUDIED. UNDER A SPA, THE FDA AGREES TO NOT LATER ALTER ITS POSITION WITH RESPECT TO ADEQUACY OF THE DESIGN, EXECUTION OR ANALYSES OF THE CLINICAL TRIAL INTENDED TO FORM THE PRIMARY BASIS OF AN EFFECTIVENESS CLAIM IN AN NDA, WITHOUT THE SPONSOR\u2019S AGREEMENT, UNLESS THE FDA IDENTIFIES A SUBSTANTIAL SCIENTIFIC ISSUE ESSENTIAL TO DETERMINING THE SAFETY OR EFFICACY OF THE DRUG AFTER TESTING BEGINS.  PRIOR TO INITIATING OUR CURRENTLY ONGOING PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL(S), WE SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL FOR THE DESIGN, EXECUTION AND ANALYSIS UNDER A SPA.  NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS  THE RESULTS OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT, PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS ARE SUBMITTED TO THE FDA AS PART OF AN NDA. NDAS ALSO MUST CONTAIN EXTENSIVE CHEMISTRY, MANUFACTURING AND CONTROL INFORMATION. AN NDA MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A SIGNIFICANT USER FEE, WHICH MAY BE WAIVED IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. ONCE THE SUBMISSION HAS BEEN ACCEPTED FOR FILING, THE FDA\u2019S GOAL IS TO REVIEW APPLICATIONS WITHIN TEN MONTHS OF SUBMISSION OR, IF THE APPLICATION RELATES TO AN UNMET MEDICAL NEED IN A SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING INDICATION, SIX MONTHS FROM SUBMISSION. THE REVIEW PROCESS IS OFTEN SIGNIFICANTLY EXTENDED BY FDA REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR CLARIFICATION. THE FDA MAY REFER THE APPLICATION TO AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR REVIEW, EVALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION AS TO WHETHER THE APPLICATION SHOULD BE APPROVED. FOR NEW ONCOLOGY PRODUCTS, THE FDA WILL OFTEN SOLICIT AN OPINION FROM AN ODAC, A PANEL OF EXPERT AUTHORITIES KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THE FIELDS OF GENERAL ONCOLOGY, PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY, HEMATOLOGIC ONCOLOGY, IMMUNOLOGIC ONCOLOGY, BIOSTATISTICS, AND OTHER RELATED PROFESSIONS. THE ODAC PANEL REVIEWS AND EVALUATES DATA CONCERNING THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETED AND INVESTIGATIONAL HUMAN DRUG PRODUCTS FOR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER, AND MAKES APPROPRIATE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COMMISSIONER OF FOOD AND DRUGS. THE FDA IS NOT BOUND BY THE RECOMMENDATION OF AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THE FDA MAY DENY  25  APPROVAL OF AN NDA BY ISSUING A COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER (CRL) IF THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY CRITERIA ARE NOT SATISFIED.  A CRL MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CLINICAL DATA AND/OR AN ADDITIONAL PIVOTAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL(S), AND/OR OTHER SIGNIFICANT, EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO CLINICAL TRIALS, PRECLINICAL STUDIES OR MANUFACTURING. DATA FROM CLINICAL TRIA  LS ARE NOT ALWAYS CONCLUSIVE AND THE FDA MAY INTERPRET DATA DIFFERENTLY THAN WE OR OUR COLLABORATORS INTERPRET DATA. APPROVAL MAY BE CONTINGENT ON A RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS) THAT LIMITS THE LABELING, DISTRIBUTION OR PROMOTION OF A DRU  G PRODUCT. ONCE ISSUED, THE FDA MAY WITHDRAW PRODUCT APPROVAL IF ONGOING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT MET OR IF SAFETY PROBLEMS OCCUR AFTER THE PRODUCT REACHES THE MARKET. IN ADDITION, THE FDA MAY REQUIRE TESTING, INCLUDING PHASE IV CLINICAL TRIALS, AND  SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS TO MONITOR THE SAFETY EFFECTS OF APPROVED PRODUCTS WHICH HAVE BEEN COMMERCIALIZED, AND THE FDA HAS THE POWER TO PREVENT OR LIMIT FURTHER MARKETING OF A PRODUCT BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THESE POST-MARKETING PROGRAMS OR OTHER INFORMATIO  N.  THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY REGULATORY PATHWAYS FOR A NEW DRUG APPLICATION UNDER SECTION 505 OF THE FFDCA: SECTION 505 (B)(1), SECTION 505 (B)(2) AND SECTION 505(J).  A SECTION 505 (B)(1) APPLICATION IS USED FOR APPROVAL OF A NEW DRUG (FOR CLINICAL USE) WHOSE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY APPROVED. A SECTION 505 (B)(2) APPLICATION IS USED FOR A NEW DRUG THAT RELIES ON DATA NOT DEVELOPED BY THE APPLICANT. SECTION 505(B)(2) OF THE FFDCA WAS ENACTED AS PART OF THE DRUG PRICE COMPETITION AND PATENT TERM RESTORATION ACT OF 1984, ALSO KNOWN AS THE HATCH-WAXMAN ACT. THIS STATUTORY PROVISION PERMITS THE APPROVAL OF AN NDA WHERE AT LEAST SOME OF THE INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR APPROVAL COMES FROM STUDIES NOT CONDUCTED BY OR FOR THE APPLICANT AND FOR WHICH THE APPLICANT HAS NOT OBTAINED A RIGHT OF REFERENCE. THE HATCH-WAXMAN ACT PERMITS THE APPLICANT TO RELY IN PART UPON THE FDA\u2019S FINDINGS OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS FOR PREVIOUSLY APPROVED PRODUCTS. SECTION 505(J) APPLICATION, ALSO KNOWN AS AN ABBREVIATED NDA, IS USED FOR A GENERIC VERSION OF A DRUG THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN APPROVED.  ORPHAN DRUG EXCLUSIVITY  SOME JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, MAY DESIGNATE DRUGS FOR RELATIVELY SMALL PATIENT POPULATIONS AS ORPHAN DRUGS. PURSUANT TO THE ORPHAN DRUG ACT, THE FDA GRANTS ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION TO DRUGS INTENDED TO TREAT A RARE DISEASE OR CONDITION, WHICH IS GENERALLY A DISEASE OR CONDITION THAT AFFECTS FEWER THAN 200,000 INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE ORPHAN DESIGNATION IS GRANTED FOR A COMBINATION OF A DRUG ENTITY AND AN INDICATION AND THEREFORE IT CAN BE GRANTED FOR AN EXISTING DRUG WITH A NEW (ORPHAN) INDICATION. APPLICATIONS ARE MADE TO THE OFFICE OF ORPHAN PRODUCTS DEVELOPMENT AT THE FDA AND A DECISION OR REQUEST FOR MORE INFORMATION IS RENDERED IN 60 DAYS. NDAS FOR DESIGNATED ORPHAN DRUGS ARE EXEMPT FROM USER FEES, OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CLINICAL PROTOCOL ASSISTANCE, ARE ELIGIBLE FOR TAX CREDITS UP TO 50% OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, AND ARE GRANTED A SEVEN-YEAR PERIOD OF EXCLUSIVITY UPON APPROVAL. THE FDA CANNOT APPROVE THE SAME DRUG FOR THE SAME CONDITION DURING THIS PERIOD OF EXCLUSIVITY, EXCEPT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A NEW PRODUCT DEMONSTRATES SUPERIORITY TO THE ORIGINAL TREATMENT. EXCLUSIVITY BEGINS ON THE DATE THAT THE MARKET  ING APPLICATION IS APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR THE DESIGNATED ORPHAN DRUG, AND AN ORPHAN DESIGNATION DOES NOT LIMIT THE USE OF THAT DRUG IN OTHER APPLICATIONS OUTSIDE THE APPROVED DESIGNATION IN EITHER A COMMERCIAL OR INVESTIGATIONAL SETTING.  THE FDA HAS GRANTED DELCATH SIX ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATIONS. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FDA GRANTED DELCATH TWO ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATIONS FOR THE DRUG MELPHALAN FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH CUTANEOUS MELANOMA, AS WELL AS PATIENTS WITH OCULAR MELANOMA. IN MAY 2009, THE FDA GRANTED DELCATH AN ADDITIONAL ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION OF THE DRUG MELPHALAN FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS. IN AUGUST 2009, THE FDA GRANTED DELCATH AN ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION OF THE DRUG DOXORUBICIN FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY LIVER CANCER. IN OCTOBER 2013, THE FDA GRANTED DELCATH AN ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION OF THE DRUG MELPHALAN FOR THE TREATMENT OF HCC. IN JULY 2015, THE FDA GRANTED DELCATH AN ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION OF THE DRUG MELPHALAN FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHOLANGIO  CARCINOMA, WHICH INCLUDES ICC.  THE GRANTING OF ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATIONS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE FDA HAS APPROVED A NEW DRUG. COMPANIES MUST STILL PURSUE THE RIGOROUS DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL PROCESS THAT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL TIME, EFFORT AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES, AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT ANY APPROVALS FOR OUR PRODUCT WILL BE GRANTED AT ALL, OR ON A TIMELY BASIS.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER RIGHTS  OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS, MAINTAIN TRADE SECRET AND KNOW-HOW PROTECTION, ENFORCE OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AGAINST INFRINGERS, AND OPERATE WITHOUT INFRINGING ON THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES. BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND BRINGING THEM THROUGH THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS, THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY PLACES CONSIDERABLE EMPHASIS ON OBTAINING PATENT PROTECTION AND MAINTAINING TRADE SECRET PROTECTION FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS, PROCESSES, KNOW-HOW, AND METHODS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HOLDS RIGHTS IN EIGHT U.S. UTILITY PATENTS, ONE U.S. DESIGN PATENT, FIVE PENDING U.S. UTILITY PATENT APPLICATIONS, SIX ISSUED FOREIGN COUNTERPART UTILITY PATENTS (INCLUDING THE VALIDATION OF A EUROPEAN PATENT DIRECTED TO OUR FILTER APPARATUS IN EIGHT EUROPEAN COUNTRI  ES, SIX ISSUED FOREIGN COUNTERPART DESIGN PATENTS, AND EIGHT PENDING FOREIGN COUNTERPART PATENT APPLICATIONS. IN JULY 2017, A PATENT DIRECTED TO OUR CHEMOTHERAPY FILTRATION SYSTEM WAS ISSUED BY THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE.  IN OCTOBER 2018 AND FEBRUARY 2019 PATENTS DIRECTED TO OUR CHEMOTHERAPY FILTRATION SYSTEM AND A METHOD OF USING OUR FILTER AND FRAME APPARATUS WERE ISSUED BY THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE. A NOTICE OF  26  ALLOWANCE WAS OBTAINED FROM THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEM  ARK OFFICE FOR THE PATENT APPLICATION ENTITLED \u201cAPPARATUS FOR REMOVING CHEMOTHERAPY COMPOUNDS FROM BLOOD\u201d WITH ALLOWED CLAIMS TO A KIT OF PARTS CAPABLE OF BEING ASSEMBLED FOR DELIVERING A SMALL MOLECULE CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT TO A SUBJECT. THE ALLOWED CLAI  MS ARE DIRECTED TO CHEMOSAT. A HONG KONG PATENT DIRECTED TO OUR FILTER AND FRAME APPARATUS WAS ISSUED IN MARCH OF 2018. A EUROPEAN PATENT WAS GRANTED FOR OUR CHEMOTHERAPY FILTRATION SYSTEM IN NOVEMBER 2018 AND A EUROPEAN PATENT APPLICATION DIRECTED TO A ME  THOD OF USING OUR FILTER AND FRAME APPARATUS WAS GRANTED IN APRIL 2019 BY THE EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE.  WHEN APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANY ACTIVELY PURSUES PROTECTION OF OUR PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES, PROCESSES, AND METHODS BY FILING UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL PATENT AND TRADEMARK APPLICATIONS. WE SEEK TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL PATENT PROTECTION FOR TECHNOLOGY INVENTED THROUGH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, AND CLINICAL USE OF THE CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS THAT WILL ENABLE US TO EXPAND OUR PATENT PORTFOLIO AROUND ADVANCES TO OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY, AND METHODS FOR OUR CURRENT APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS BEYOND THE TREATMENT OF CANCERS IN THE LIVER.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS WILL RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF PATENTS, THAT PATENTS ISSUED TO OR LICENSED BY US WILL NOT BE CHALLENGED OR CIRCUMVENTED BY COMPETITORS, OR THAT THESE PATENTS WILL BE FOUND TO BE VALID OR SUFFICIENTLY BROAD TO PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGY OR PROVIDE US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.  TO MAINTAIN OUR PROPRIETARY POSITION, WE ALSO RELY ON TRADE SECRETS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE TO PROTECT PROPRIETARY MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, TECHNOLOGY, AND KNOW-HOW RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS.  WE RELY, IN PART, ON CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH OUR MARKETING PARTNERS, EMPLOYEES, ADVISORS, VENDORS AND CONSULTANTS TO PROTECT OUR TRADE SECRETS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO SEEK TO MAINTAIN OUR TRADE SECRETS THROUGH MAINTENANCE OF THE PHYSICAL SECURITY OF THE PREMISES WHERE OUR TRADE SECRETS ARE LOCATED.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE AGREEMENTS WILL NOT BE BREACHED, THAT WE WILL HAVE ADEQUATE REMEDIES FOR ANY BREACH, THAT OTHERS WILL NOT INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOP EQUIVALENT PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OR THAT THIRD PARTIES WILL NOT OTHERWISE GAIN ACCESS TO OUR TRADE SECRETS AND PROPRIETARY KNOWLEDGE.  IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, UNITED STATES PATENT LAW ALLOWS FOR THE EXTENSION OF A PATENT\u2019S DURATION FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO FIVE YEARS AFTER FDA APPROVAL.  THE COMPANY INTENDS TO SEEK EXTENSION FOR ONE OF OUR PATENTS AFTER FDA APPROVAL IF IT HAS NOT EXPIRED PRIOR TO THE DATE OF APPROVAL. IN ADDITION TO OUR PROPRIETARY PROTECTIONS, THE FDA HAS GRANTED DELCATH FIVE ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATIONS THAT PROVIDE US A SEVEN-YEAR PERIOD OF EXCLUSIVE MARKETING BEGINNING ON THE DATE THAT OUR NDA IS APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR THE DESIGNATED ORPHAN DRUG. WHILE THE EXCLUSIVITY ONLY APPLIES TO THE INDICATION FOR WHICH THE DRUG HAS BEEN APPROVED, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WILL PROVIDE US WITH ADDED PROTECTION ONCE COMMERCIALIZATION OF AN ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATED PRODUCT BEGINS.  THERE HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION REGARDING PATENT AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL DEVICE AREAS. IF A THIRD PARTY ASSERTS A CLAIM AGAINST DELCATH, THE COMPANY MAY BE FORCED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT TIME AND MONEY DEFENDING SUCH ACTIONS AND AN ADVERSE DETERMINATION IN ANY PATENT LITIGATION COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES TO THIRD PARTIES, REQUIRE US TO REDESIGN OUR PRODUCT, REQUIRE US TO SEEK LICENSES FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND, IF LICENSES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, PREVENT US FROM MANUFACTURING, SELLING OR USING OUR SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY, DELCATH PLANS TO ENFORCE ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS VIGOROUSLY AND MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO INITIATE LITIGATION TO ENFORCE OUR PATENT RIGHTS OR TO PROTECT OUR TRADE SECRETS OR KNOW-HOW. PATENT LITIGATION CAN BE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE FAVORABLE TO US.  PATENT NO.

ADVERSE EVENT EXPERIENCE WITH THE PRODUCT MUST BE REPORTED TO THE FDA IN A TIMELY FASHION AND PHARMACOVIGILANCE PROGRAMS TO PROACTIVELY LOOK FOR THESE ADVERSE EVENTS ARE MANDATED BY THE  28  FDA. DRUG MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER THEIR ESTABLISHMENTS WITH THE FDA AND CERTAIN STATE AGENC  IES, AND ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS BY THE FDA AND CERTAIN STATE AGENCIES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH ONGOING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING CGMPS, WHICH IMPOSE CERTAIN PROCEDURAL AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS UPON US AND OUR THIRD-PARTY  MANUFACTURERS. FOLLOWING SUCH INSPECTIONS, THE FDA MAY ISSUE NOTICES ON FORM 483 AND UNTITLED LETTERS OR WARNING LETTERS THAT COULD CAUSE US OR OUR THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS TO MODIFY CERTAIN ACTIVITIES. A FORM 483 NOTICE, IF ISSUED AT THE CONCLUSION OF AN  FDA INSPECTION, CAN LIST CONDITIONS THE FDA INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE MAY HAVE VIOLATED CGMP OR OTHER FDA REGULATIONS OR GUIDELINES. IN ADDITION TO FORM 483 NOTICES AND UNTITLED LETTERS OR WARNING LETTERS, FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE STATUTORY AND REGULATORY R  EQUIREMENTS CAN SUBJECT A MANUFACTURER TO POSSIBLE LEGAL OR REGULATORY ACTION, SUCH AS SUSPENSION OF MANUFACTURING, SEIZURE OF PRODUCT, INJUNCTIVE ACTION OR POSSIBLE CIVIL PENALTIES. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT WE OR OUR PRESENT OR FUTURE THIRD-PARTY MANUFAC  TURERS OR SUPPLIERS WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE CGMP REGULATIONS AND OTHER ONGOING FDA REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IF WE OR OUR PRESENT OR FUTURE THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS OR SUPPLIERS ARE NOT ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS, THE FDA MAY REQUIRE US  TO RECALL OUR PRODUCTS FROM DISTRIBUTION OR WITHDRAW ANY POTENTIAL APPROVALS OF AN NDA FOR THAT PRODUCT.  THE FDA CLOSELY REGULATES THE POST-APPROVAL MARKETING AND PROMOTION OF DRUGS, INCLUDING STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS FOR DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING, DISSEMINATION OF OFF-LABEL INFORMATION, INDUSTRY-SPONSORED SCIENTIFIC AND EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES INVOLVING THE INTERNET. DRUGS MAY BE MARKETED ONLY FOR THE APPROVED INDICATIONS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE APPROVED LABEL. FURTHER, IF THERE ARE ANY MODIFICATIONS TO THE DRUG, INCLUDING CHANGES IN INDICATIONS, LABELING, OR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES OR FACILITIES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT AND OBTAIN FDA APPROVAL OF A NEW OR SUPPLEMENTAL NDA, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL DATA OR CONDUCT ADDITIONAL PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS CAN RESULT IN ADVERSE PUBLICITY, WARNING LETTERS, CORRECTIVE ADVERTISING AND POTENTIAL CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  PHYSICIANS MAY PRESCRIBE LEGALLY AVAILABLE PRODUCTS FOR USES THAT ARE NOT DESCRIBED IN THE PRODUCT\u2019S LABELING AND THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE TESTED BY US AND APPROVED BY THE FDA. SUCH OFF-LABEL USES ARE COMMON ACROSS MEDICAL SPECIALTIES, IN PARTICULAR IN ONCOLOGY. PHYSICIANS MAY BELIEVE THAT SUCH OFF-LABEL USES ARE THE BEST TREATMENT FOR MANY PATIENTS IN VARIED CIRCUMSTANCES. THE FDA DOES NOT REGULATE THE BEHAVIOR OF PHYSICIANS IN THEIR CHOICE OF TREATMENTS. THE FDA DOES, HOWEVER, IMPOSE STRINGENT RESTRICTIONS ON MANUFACTURERS\u2019 COMMUNICATIONS REGARDING OFF-LABEL USE.  EUROPEAN REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT  IN THE EEA, THE CHEMOSAT SYSTEM IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION AS A MEDICAL DEVICE. THE EEA IS COMPOSED OF THE 27 MEMBER STATES OF THE EU PLUS NORWAY, ICELAND AND LIECHTENSTEIN. UNDER THE EU MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE (DIRECTIVE NO 93/42/ECC OF 14 JUNE 1993, AS LAST AMENDED), DRUG DELIVERY PRODUCTS SUCH AS THE CHEMOSAT SYSTEM IS GOVERNED BY THE EU LAWS ON PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ONLY IF THEY ARE (I) PLACED ON THE MARKET IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE DEVICE AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT FORM A SINGLE INTEGRAL UNIT WHICH IS INTENDED EXCLUSIVELY FOR USE IN THE GIVEN COMBINATION, AND (II) THE PRODUCT IS NOT REUSABLE. IN SUCH CASES, THE DRUG DELIVERY PRODUCT IS GOVERNED BY THE EU CODE ON MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE (DIRECTIVE 2001/83/EC, AS LAST AMENDED), WHILE THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE EU MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE APPLY TO THE SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE-RELATED DEVICE FEATURES OF THE PRODUCT. BECAUSE WE DO NOT INTEND TO PLACE THE CHEMOSAT SYSTEM ON THE EEA MARKET AS A SINGLE INTEGRAL UNIT WITH MELPHALAN, THE PRODUCT IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY THE EU MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE, WHILE THE SEPARATELY MARKETED DRUG IS GOVERNED BY THE EU CODE RELATING TO MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE AND OTHER  EU LEGISLATION APPLICABLE TO DRUGS FOR HUMAN USE.  BEFORE WE MAY COMMERCIALIZE A MEDICAL DEVICE IN THE EEA, WE MUST COMPLY WITH THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE EU MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS ENTITLES A MANUFACTURER TO AFFIX A CE CONFORMITY MARK, WITHOUT WHICH THE PRODUCTS CANNOT BE COMMERCIALIZED IN THE EEA. TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE WITH THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS AND OBTAIN THE RIGHT TO AFFIX THE CE CONFORMITY MARK, MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURERS MUST UNDERGO A CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE, WHICH VARIES ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF MEDICAL DEVICE AND ITS CLASSIFICATION. IN APRIL 2011, WE OBTAINED AUTHORIZATION TO AFFIX A CE MARK FOR THE GENERATION ONE CHEMOSAT SYSTEM AND BEGAN EUROPEAN COMMERCIALIZATION WITH THIS VERSION OF  THE CHEMOSAT SYSTEM IN EARLY 2012. IN APRIL 2012, THE COMPANY OBTAINED AUTHORIZATION TO AFFIX A CE MARK FOR THE GENERATION TWO CHEMOSAT SYSTEM, AND SINCE THIS TIME ALL PROCEDURES IN EUROPE HAVE BEEN PERFORMED WITH THIS VERSION OF THE SYSTEM.  THE MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE ESTABLISHES A CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM PLACING DEVICES INTO CLASS I, IIA, IIB, OR III, DEPENDING ON THE RISKS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE. FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF LOW RISK MEDICAL DEVICES (I.E., CLASS I DEVICES WHICH ARE NON-STERILE AND DO NOT HAVE A MEASURING FUNCTION), THE MANUFACTURER MAY ISSUE AN EC DECLARATION OF CONFORMITY BASED ON A SELF-ASSESSMENT OF THE CONFORMITY OF ITS PRODUCTS WITH THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE EU MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVES. OTHER DEVICES ARE SUBJECT  TO A CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE REQUIRING THE INTERVENTION OF A NOTIFIED BODY, WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION DESIGNATED BY A MEMBER STATE OF THE EEA TO CONDUCT CONFORMITY ASSESSMENTS.  CHEMOSAT IS REGULATED AS A CLASS IIB MEDICAL DEVICE. AS A CLASS IIB MEDICAL DEVICE, THE NOTIFIED BODY IS NOT REQUIRED TO CARRY OUT AN EXAMINATION OF THE PRODUCT\u2019S DESIGN DOSSIER AS PART OF ITS CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT PRIOR TO COMMERCIALIZATION. THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE EU MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE (DIRECTIVE 93/42 EC) AND IS SUBJECT TO A  29  CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE REQUIRING THE INTERVENTION OF A NOTIFIED BODY.  THE CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE FOR CLAS  S IIB MEDICAL DEVICES REQUIRES THE MANUFACTURER TO APPLY FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF ITS QUALITY SYSTEM FOR THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND INSPECTION OF ITS MEDICAL DEVICES BY A NOTIFIED BODY.  THE NOTIFIED BODY WILL AUDIT THE SYSTEM TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT CONFORM  S TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE.  IF THE NOTIFIED BODY\u2019S ASSESSMENT IS FAVORABLE, IT WILL ISSUE A FULL QUALITY ASSURANCE CERTIFICATE, WHICH ENABLES THE MANUFACTURER TO DRAW A DECLARATION OF CONFORMITY AND AFFIX THE CE MARK TO THE MEDIC  AL DEVICES COVERED BY THE ASSESSMENT. THEREAFTER, THE NOTIFIED BODY WILL CARRY OUT PERIODIC AUDITS TO ENSURE THAT THE APPROVED QUALITY SYSTEM IS APPLIED BY THE MANUFACTURER.  A MANUFACTURER WITHOUT A REGISTERED PLACE OF BUSINESS IN A MEMBER STATE OF THE EU WHICH PLACES A MEDICAL DEVICE ON THE MARKET UNDER ITS OWN NAME MUST DESIGNATE AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE ESTABLISHED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHO CAN ACT BEFORE, AND BE ADDRESSED BY, THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES ON THE MANUFACTURER\u2019S BEHALF WITH REGARD TO THE MANUFACTURER\u2019S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EU MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE. WE APPOINTED SUCH A REPRESENTATIVE PRIOR TO ESTABLISHING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE EEA.  WITH THE DELCATH SYSTEMS LTD. INFRASTRUCTURE NOW FIRMLY IN PLACE, THE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE BEEN FORMALLY TRANSFERRED INTERNALLY AND THERE IS NO LONGER A NEED FOR A THIRD-PARTY REPRESENTATIVE.  IN THE EEA, WE MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH THE MEDICAL DEVICE VIGILANCE SYSTEM, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE PROTECTION OF HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PATIENTS, USERS AND OTHERS BY REDUCING THE LIKELIHOOD OF RECURRENCE OF INCIDENTS RELATED TO THE USE OF A MEDICAL DEVICE. UNDER THIS SYSTEM, INCIDENTS ARE DEFINED AS ANY MALFUNCTION OR DETERIORATION IN THE CHARACTERISTICS AND/OR PERFORMANCE OF A DEVICE, AS WELL AS ANY INADEQUACY IN THE LABELING OR THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE WHICH, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, MIGHT LEAD TO OR MIGHT HAVE LED TO THE DEATH OF A PATIENT, OR USER OR OF OTHER PERSONS OR TO A SERIOUS DETERIORATION IN THEIR STATE OF HEALTH. WHEN A MEDICAL DEVICE IS SUSPECTED TO BE A CONTRIBUTORY CAUSE OF AN INCIDENT, ITS MANUFACTURER OR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE IN THE EU MUST REPORT IT TO THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY OF THE MEMBER STATE WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. INCIDENTS ARE GENERALLY INVESTIGATED BY THE MANUFACTURER. THE MANUFACTURER\u2019S INVESTIGATION IS MONITORED BY THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY, WHICH MAY INTERVENE, OR INITIATE AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION  IF CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE. AN INVESTIGATION MAY CONCLUDE IN THE ADOPTION OF A FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION (FSCA). AN FSCA IS AN ACTION TAKEN BY A MANUFACTURER TO REDUCE A RISK OF DEATH OR SERIOUS DETERIORATION IN THE STATE OF HEALTH ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF A MEDICAL DEVICE THAT IS ALREADY PLACED ON THE MARKET. AN FSCA MAY INCLUDE DEVICE RECALL, MODI  FICATION EXCHANGE AND DESTRUCTION. FSCAS MUST BE NOTIFIED BY THE MANUFACTURER OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE TO ITS CUSTOMERS AND/OR THE END USERS OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE VIA A FIELD SAFETY NOTICE.  IN THE EEA, THE OFF-LABEL PROMOTION OF A PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED UNDER THE EU COMMUNITY CODE ON MEDICINAL PRODUCTS, WHICH PROVIDES THAT ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE PROMOTION OF A DRUG MUST COMPLY WITH THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN ITS APPROVED SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS. OUR PRODUCT INSTRUCTIONS AND INDICATION REFERENCE THE CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT MELPHALAN HYDROCHLORIDE. HOWEVER, NO MELPHALAN LABELS IN THE EEA REFERENCE OUR PRODUCT, AND THE LABELS VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROVED INDICATION OF THE DRUG AND ITS MODE OF ADMINISTRATION. IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, PHYSICIANS ARE GENERALLY ALLOWED, UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, TO USE OR PRESCRIBE A PRODUCT IN WAYS NOT APPROVED BY REGULATORY AUTHORIT  IES. PHYSICIANS INTENDING TO USE OUR DEVICE MUST OBTAIN MELPHALAN SEPARATELY FOR USE WITH THE CHEMOSAT SYSTEM AND MUST USE MELPHALAN INDEPENDENTLY AT THEIR DISCRETION.  IN THE EEA, THE ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION OF OUR PRODUCTS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO EEA MEMBER STATES LAWS IMPLEMENTING THE EU MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE, DIRECTIVE 2006/114/EC CONCERNING MISLEADING AND COMPARATIVE ADVERTISING AND DIRECTIVE 2005/29/EC ON UNFAIR COMMERCIAL PRACTICES, AS WELL AS OTHER EEA MEMBER STATE LEGISLATION GOVERNING THE ADVERTIS  ING AND PROMOTION OF MEDICAL DEVICES. THESE LAWS MAY FURTHER LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION OF OUR PRODUCTS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND MAY ALSO IMPOSE LIMITATIONS ON OUR PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES WITH HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS.  FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE EEA MEMBER STATE LAWS IMPLEMENTING THE MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE, WITH THE EU AND EEA MEMBER STATE LAWS ON THE PROMOTION OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS OR WITH OTHER APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CAN RESULT IN ENFORCEMENT ACTION BY THE EEA MEMBER S  TATE AUTHORITIES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING: FINES, IMPRISONMENT, ORDERS FORFEITING PRODUCTS OR PROHIBITING OR SUSPENDING THEIR SUPPLY TO THE MARKET, OR REQUIRING THE MANUFACTURER TO ISSUE PUBLIC WARNINGS, OR TO CONDUCT A PRODUCT RECALL.  THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION RECENTLY REVIEWED THE MEDICAL DEVICE DIRECTIVE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK AND PROMULGATED  REGULATION (EU) 2017/745 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL OF 5 APRIL 2017 ON MEDICAL DEVICES, AMENDING DIRECTIVE 2001/83/EC, REGULATION EC)  NO 178/2002 AND REGULATION (EC) NO 1223/2009 AND REPEALING COUNCIL DIRECTIVES 90/385/EEC AND 93/42/EEC.  THIS NEW MEDICAL DEVICE REGULATION BECAME EFFECTIVE ON MAY 25, 2017, MARKING THE START OF A 3-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD FOR MANUFACTURERS SELLING MEDICAL DEVICE IN EUROPE TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW MEDICAL DEVICE REGULATION (\u201cMDR\u201d) WHICH GOVERNS ALL FACETS OF MEDICAL DEVICES.  THE TRANSITION TASK IS HIGHLY COMPLEX AND TOUCHES EVERY ASPECT OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION AND POST MARKETING EVALUATION.  30  EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSING THESE CHANGES WILL REQUIRE A COMPLETE REVIEW OF OUR DEVICE OPERATIONS TO DETERMINE WHAT IS NECESSARY TO COMPLY.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE MDR REGULATORY CHANGES WILL IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AT THIS TIME, THOUGH IMPLE  MENTATION OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE LEGISLATION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS.  OTHER INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS  WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES IN SELECT MARKETS WHEN RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE AND AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME.  COMPETITION  THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY EXTENSIVE RESEARCH, RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS AND SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM NUMEROUS HEALTHCARE COMPANIES AND ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS. COMPETITION IN THE CANCER TREATMENT INDUSTRY IS INTENSE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRIMARY COMPETITIVE FACTORS FOR PRODUCTS ADDRESSING CANCER INCLUDE SAFETY, EFFICACY, EASE OF USE, RELIABILITY AND PRICE. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT PHYSICIAN RELATIONSHIPS, ESPECIALLY RELATIONSHIPS WITH LEADERS IN THE MEDICAL AND SURGICAL ONCOLOGY COMMUNITIES, ARE IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND NEW HEALTHCARE REFORMS COULD PUT COMPETITIVE PRESSURE ON US, INCLUDING REDUCED SELLIN  G PRICES AND POTENTIAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES, AND OVERALL PROCEDURE RATES. CERTAIN MARKETS IN EUROPE ARE EXPERIENCING THE EFFECTS OF CONTINUED ECONOMIC WEAKNESS, WHICH IS AFFECTING HEALTHCARE BUDGETS AND REIMBURSEMENT.  CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS COMPETES WITH ALL FORMS OF LIVER CANCER TREATMENTS, INCLUDING SURGERY, SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY, FOCAL THERAPIES AND PALLIATIVE CARE. IN THE DISEASE STATES WE ARE TARGETING THERE ARE ALSO NUMEROUS CLINICAL TRIALS SPONSORED BY THIRD-PARTIES, WHICH CAN COMPETE FOR POTENTIAL PATIENTS IN THE NEAR TERM AND MAY ULTIMATELY LEAD TO NEW COMPETITIVE THERAPIES.  FOR OCULAR MELANOMA LIVER METASTASES, THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO APPROVED OR EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS, AND PATIENTS ARE GENERALLY TREATED WITH A VARIETY OF FOCAL AND  REGIONAL TECHNIQUES. THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPANIES DEVELOPING AND MARKETING DEVICES FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF FOCAL THERAPIES, INCLUDING COVIDIAN, BIOCOMPATIBLES, MERIT, CELENOVA, SIRTEX, ANGIODYNAMICS, AND MANY OTHERS.  FOR ICC, GEMCITABINE PLUS CISPLATIN REMA  INS THE STANDARD OF CARE FOR THE TREATMENT OF ICC IN PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT CANDIDATES FOR SURGERY.  SEVERAL THERAPIES HAVE BEEN RECENTLY APPROVED FOR UNRESECTABLE OR METASTATIC CUTANEOUS MELANOMA, WHICH MAY ENCOMPASS LIVER METASTASES.  DABRAFENIB (TAFINLARTM, GLAXOSMITHKLINE), IS INDICATED AS SINGLE AGENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH UNRESECTABLE OR METASTATIC MELANOMA WITH BRAF V600E MUTATION, AND IN COMBINATION WITH TRAMETINIB IN UNRESECTABLE OR METASTATIC MELANOMA WITH BRAF V600E OR V600K MUTATIONS.  FURTHERMORE, TRAMETINIB (MEKINISTTM, GLAXOSMITHKLINE) IS INDICATED AS SINGLE AGENT (IN ADDITION TO IN COMBINATION WITH DABRAFINIB) FOR TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH UNRESECTABLE OR METASTATIC MELANOMA WITH BRAF V600E OR V600K MUTATIONS. PREVIOUSLY APPROVED MEL  ANOMA THERAPIES SUCH AS THE BIOLOGIC IPILIMUMAB (YERVOYTM, BRISTOL MYERS SQUIBB) AND THE B-RAF TARGETED DRUG VEMURAFENIB (ZELBORAFTM, GENENTECH) MAY ALSO MAKE UP THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE FOR THE TREATMENT OF METASTATIC LIVER DISEASE.  MANY OF THESE TREATMENT  S ARE APPROVED IN EUROPE AND OTHER GLOBAL MARKETS.  MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL, TECHNOLOGICAL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND PERSONNEL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE IN CONDUCTING CLINICAL TRIALS, REGULATORY, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION CAPABILITIES. OUR COMPETITORS MAY DEVELOP ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT METHODS, OR ACHIEVE EARLIER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, IN WHICH CASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF US ACHIEVING MEANINGFUL REVENUES  OR PROFITABILITY WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED.  MANUFACTURING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  WE MANUFACTURE CERTAIN CRITICAL MEDICAL DEVICE COMPONENTS INCLUDING OUR PROPRIETARY FILTER MEDIA AND ASSEMBLE AND PACKAGE THE CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS AT OUR FACILITY IN QUEENSBURY, NEW YORK. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED OUR EUROPEAN HEADQUARTERS AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITY IN GALWAY, IRELAND WHERE WE CONDUCT FINAL MANUFACTURING, PROCESSING AND ASSEMBLY. DELCATH CURRENTLY UTILIZES THIRD-PARTIES TO MANUFACTURE SOME COMPONENTS OF THE CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS. THE CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS AND ITS COMPONENTS MUST BE MANUFACTURED AND STERILIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPROVED MANUFACTURING AND PRE-DETERMINED PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COMPONENTS WILL REQUIRE STERILI  ZATION PRIOR TO DISTRIBUTION AND DELCATH RELIES ON THIRD-PARTY VENDORS TO PERFORM THE STERILIZATION PROCESS.  WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. TO HONOR THIS COMMITMENT, DELCATH HAS IMPLEMENTED UPDATED QUALITY SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT OUR ORGANIZATION. DELCATH\u2019S QUALITY SYSTEM STARTS WITH THE INITIAL PRODUCT SPECIFICATION AND CONTINUES  31  THROUGH THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT, COMPONENT SPECIFICATION PROCESS AND THE MANUFACTURING, SALE AND SERVICING OF THE PRODUCT. THESE SYSTEMS ARE DE  SIGNED TO ENABLE US TO SATISFY THE VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL QUALITY SYSTEM REGULATIONS INCLUDING THOSE OF THE FDA WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCTS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES AND THOSE ESTABLISHED BY THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ORGANIZATION (ISO) WITH RESPECT TO PRODUC  TS SOLD IN THE EEA. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ISO 13485 CERTIFICATION FOR MEDICAL DEVICES TO BE SOLD IN THE EEA, WHICH REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, AN IMPLEMENTED QUALITY SYSTEM THAT APPLIES TO COMPONENT QUALITY, SUPPLIER CONTROL, PRODUCT DESIGN  AND MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. ON FEBRUARY 17, 2011, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ACHIEVED ISO 13485 CERTIFICATION FOR OUR QUEENSBURY MANUFACTURING FACILITY. ON DECEMBER 28, 2011, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ACHIEVED ISO 13485 CERTIFICATION FOR OUR GALWAY, IRELAND  FACILITY.  ALL DELCATH MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ARE PRESENTLY ISO 13485:2016 CERTIFIED.  RECENT EVENTS  ON JULY 11, 2019, THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN ACCREDITED INVESTORS (EACH AN \u201cINVESTOR\u201d AND, COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cINVESTORS\u201d) ENTERED INTO A SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cSECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO SELL AND ISSUE TO THE INVESTORS AN AGGREGATE OF 20,000  SHARES OF SERIES E CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.01 PER SHARE,  AT A PRICE OF $1,000 PER SHARE (THE \u201cPRIVATE PLACEMENT\u201d).  PURSUANT TO THE SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY WILL ISSUE TO EACH INVESTOR A WARRANT (A \u201cWARRANT\u201d) TO PURCHASE A NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY, PAR VALUE $0.01 PER SHARE (\u201cCOMMON STOCK\u201d), EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION OF THE SERIES E PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASED BY THE INVESTOR.  EACH WARRANT WILL HAVE AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO $0.06, SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE WARRANTS (THE \u201cEXERCISE PRICE\u201d), AND BE EXERCISABLE AT ANY TIME BEGINNING ON THE DATE THAT THE COMPANY EFFECTS A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT UNTIL 5:00 P.M. (NYC TIME) ON THE DATE THAT IS FIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THE DATE THAT THE COMPANY EFFECTS A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE GROSS PROCEEDS FROM THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY  $20.0  MILLION  , BEFORE DEDUCTING CASH FEES IN THE AMOUNT OF $1.4 MILLION PAYABLE TO ROTH CAPITAL PARTNERS, LLC (\u201cROTH\u201d) FOR SERVING AS PLACEMENT AGENT FOR THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT AND CASH FEES IN THE AMOUNT OF $552,000 PAYABLE TO ROTH FOR SERVING AS PLACEMENT AGENT FOR CERTAIN PRIOR SECURITIES OFFERINGS BY THE COMPANY, AND OTHER TRANSACTION COSTS, FEES AND EXPENSES PAYABLE BY THE COMPANY.  32  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  ; COMPARISONS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  REVENUE  THE COMPANY RECORDED APPROXIMATELY $0.1 MILLION IN REVENUE RELATED TO PRODUCT SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND $0.7 MILLION IN REVENUE RELATED TO PRODUCT SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE DECREASE WAS SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY $0.2 MILLION IN OTHER REVENUE. OTHER REVENUE AND THE DECREASE IN PRODUCT REVENUE ARE BOTH RELATED TO THE COMPANY ENTERING INTO A LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH MEDAC AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THE MARKET ACCESS AND COMMERCIAL CLINICAL ADOPTION SECTION ABOVE.  COST OF GOODS SOLD  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY RECORDED COST OF GOODS SOLD OF APPROXIMATELY $0.1 MILLION COMPARED TO $0.15 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $50,000 IS RELATED TO  AN ADJUSTMENT IN THE ALLOCATION OF EXPENSES INTO COGS DURING  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $2.5 MILLION AND $2.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO NON-CASH PERSONNEL RELATED ACCRUALS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES DECREASED TO $3.3 MILLION FROM $5.7 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE A REDUCED RATE OF ENROLLMENT AND RELATED PROFESSIONAL SERVICES RELATED TO THE ONGOING ACCRUAL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PHASE 3 FOCUS TRIAL WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN FURTHER DETAIL IN THE  ACTIVE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  SECTION ABOVE. THE REDUCTION IS RELATED TO THE CASH CONSTRAINTS THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE WARRANT LIABILITY  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE WARRANT LIABILITY WAS APPROXIMATELY $7,000 AS COMPARED TO $14.7 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE INCREASE OF $14.7 MILLION IS DUE TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN WARRANTS FROM LIABILITY TO EQUITY IN 2018 AND THE CONTINUED MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS TO THE REMAINING WARRANT LIABILITY AS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 10 TO THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE  OTHER EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNTS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 8 OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, AS WELL AS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES.  INTEREST INCOME IS FROM A MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT AND INTEREST EARNED ON OPERATING ACCOUNTS.  NET LOSS  THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 OF $7.9 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $15.1 MILLION, OR 209.8%, COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF $7.2 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THIS INCREASE IN NET LOSS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $14.7 MILLION CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE WARRANT LIABILITY, A NON-CASH ITEM, AND A $2.2 MILLION DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY\u2019S CAPITAL RESOURCES AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO FUND PLANNED OPERATIONS DURING 2019. THE COMPANY WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL UNDER STRUCTURES AVAILABLE TO IT INCLUDING DEBT AND/OR EQUITY OFFERINGS THIS YEAR. IF THESE SOURCES DO NOT PROVIDE THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO FUND THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY WILL NEED TO CURTAIL CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ITS OPERATIONS OR CONSIDER OTHER MEANS OF OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FINANCING, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPANY COULD OBTAIN THE FINANCING NECESSARY TO CONTINUE ITS OPERATIONS.  33  THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.  AS NOTED ABOVE,  DELCATH HAS OPERATED AT A LOSS FOR ITS ENTIRE HISTORY AND ANTICIPATES THAT LOSSES WILL CONTINUE OVER THE COMING YEARS.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT DELCATH  WILL EVER GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES OR ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO USE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENT PROCEEDS TO FUND ITS CLINICAL AND OPERATING ACTIVITIES. DELCATH\u2019S FUTURE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON N  UMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE INITIATION AND PROGRESS OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS; OBTAINING APPROVALS AND COMPLYING WITH REGULATIONS; THE TIMING AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PRODUCT COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING MAR  KETING ARRANGEMENTS; THE TIMING AND COSTS INVOLVED IN PREPARING, FILING, PROSECUTING, DEFENDING AND ENFORCING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; AND THE EFFECT OF COMPETING TECHNOLOGICAL AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH TOTALING $1.3 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH TOTALING $3.6 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND $3.1 MILLION AT MARCH 31, 2018. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, THE COMPANY USED $2.8 MILLION AND $6.4 MILLION RESPECTIVELY, OF CASH IN ITS OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 HAVE BEEN PREPARED UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN FOR TH  E NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES AND OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. BECAUSE DELCATH\u2019S BUSINESS DOES NOT GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, THE COMPANY WILL NEED TO OBTAIN SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN ORDER TO FUND CLINICAL TRIAL RESEARCH AND SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS RELATING TO OCULAR MELANOMA LIVER METASTASES, ICC, HCC OR OTHER INDICATIONS, AND TO FULLY COMMERCIALIZE THE PRODUCT.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE EVENT IT IS IN ITS BEST INTEREST TO DO SO. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES RAISING SUCH ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BY EITHER BORROWING MONEY, SELLING SHARES OF DELCATH\u2019S CAPITAL STOCK, OR ENTERING INTO STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH APPROPRIATE PARTNERS. TO THE EXTENT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IS NOT AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, THE COMPANY MAY BE FORCED TO ABANDON SOME OR ALL OF ITS DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS, WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PROSPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS. FURTHER, THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO ITS CASH REQUIREMENTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ITS ACTUAL REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT UNFORESEEN DELAYS IN THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS, CHANGES IN THE TIMING, SCOPE, FOCUS AND DIRECTION OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND COSTS RELATED TO COMMERCIALIZING THE PRODUCT.  THE COMPANY HAS FUNDED ITS OPERATIONS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF ITS SECURITIES IN 2000, 2003, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2018 AND 2019, INCLUDING REGISTERED DIRECT OFFERINGS IN 2007, 2009 AND 2013, \u201cAT THE MARKET\u201d EQUITY OFFERING PROGRAMS IN 2012 AND 2013, AND BY THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN 2016 AND 2018, AND, MOST RECENTLY, ON JULY 15, 2019, THE COMPANY RAISED $20.0 MILLION IN THE CLOSING OF A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK AND WARRANTS TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S VARIOUS SALES OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES SEE NOTES 8, 9, AND 14 TO THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AS WELL AS NOTES 10 AND 11 TO THE COMPANY\u2019S AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  IN OCTOBER 2018, THE COMPANY FILED A REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 WITH THE SEC, WHICH WAS DECLARED EFFECTIVE ON DECEMBER 21, 2018 AND ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO OFFER AND SELL, FROM TIME TO TIME IN ONE OR MORE OFFERINGS, UP TO $100.0 MILLION OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK, WARRANTS, DEBT SECURITIES AND STOCK PURCHASE CONTRACTS AS IT DEEMS PRUDENT OR NECESSARY TO RAISE CAPITAL AT A LATER DATE. THE COMPANY HAS LOST ITS FORM S-3 ELIGIBILITY DUE TO THE LATE FILING OF ITS FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THE COMPANY INTENDS TO USE THE NET PROCEEDS FROM ANY FUTURE OFFERINGS FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FUNDING OF CLINICAL TRIALS, OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVALS, COMMERCIALIZATION OF ITS PRODUCTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL.  APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP).  CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES PERFORMANCE BASED ON ORGANIC SALES GROWTH, WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECTS GROWTH FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S EXISTING BUSINESSES AS A RESULT OF INCREASED OUTPUT, CUSTOMER BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND/OR PRICING, AND EXCLUDES SALES CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ACQUIRED OPERATIONS THE COMPANY DID NOT OWN AS OF THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR REPORTING PERIOD. THE COMPANY\u2019S ORGANIC SALES DISCLOSURES ALSO EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY THAT CAN OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF ORGANIC SALES IS MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS AS IT PROVIDES THEM WITH USEFUL INFORMATION TO AID IN IDENTIFYING UNDERLYING GROWTH TRENDS IN OUR BUSINESSES AND FACILITATES COMPARISONS OF OUR SALES PERFORMANCE WITH PRIOR PERIODS.

THESE DECREASES IN GROSS MARGIN WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BENEFITS FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S \u201cRAPID CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT\u201d OR \u201cRCI\u201d INITIATIVES.

BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT VARYING RATES BASED ON SNAP-ON\u2019S THEN-CURRENT, LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS. THE CREDIT FACILITY\u2019S FINANCIAL COVENANT REQUIRES THAT SNAP-ON MAINTAIN, AS OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER END, EITHER (I) A RATIO NOT GREATER THAN  0.60  TO 1.00 OF CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT (CONSOLIDATED DEBT NET OF CERTAIN CASH ADJUSTMENTS) TO THE SUM OF SUCH CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT PLUS TOTAL EQUITY AND LESS ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR LOSS (THE \u201cDEBT RATIO\u201d); OR (II) A RATIO NOT GREATER THAN  3.50  TO 1.00 OF SUCH CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT TO EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND CERTAIN OTHER ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE PRECEDING FOUR FISCAL QUARTERS THEN ENDED (THE \u201cDEBT TO EBITDA RATIO\u201d).

SNAP-ON GENERALLY ISSUES COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND ITS FINANCING NEEDS ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS AND USES THE CREDIT FACILITY AS BACK-UP LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT SUCH COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES.  SNAP-ON\u2019S CREDIT FACILITY AND OTHER DEBT AGREEMENTS ALSO CONTAIN CERTAIN USUAL AND CUSTOMARY BORROWING, AFFIRMATIVE, NEGATIVE AND MAINTENANCE COVENANTS. AS OF  JUNE 29, 2019  , SNAP-ON WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS OF ITS CREDIT FACILITY AND OTHER DEBT AGREEMENTS.  53  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SNAP-ON INCORPORATED  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  SNAP-ON BELIEVES IT HAS SUFFICIENT AVAILABLE CASH AND ACCESS TO BOTH COMMITTED AND UNCOMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES TO COVER ITS EXPECTED FUNDING NEEDS ON BOTH A SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BASIS. SNAP-ON MANAGES ITS AGGREGATE SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS SO AS NOT TO EXCEED ITS AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. SNAP-ON BELIEVES THAT IT CAN ACCESS SHORT-TERM DEBT MARKETS, PREDOMINANTLY THROUGH COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES AND EXISTING LINES OF CREDIT, TO FUND ITS SHORT-TERM REQUIREMENTS AND TO ENSURE NEAR-TERM LIQUIDITY. SNAP-ON REGULARLY MONITORS THE CREDIT AND FINANCIAL MARKETS AND MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT IT BELIEVES ARE FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS TO ISSUE LONG-TERM DEBT TO FURTHER IMPROVE ITS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. NEAR-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR SNAP-ON INCLUDE SCHEDULED DEBT PAYMENTS, PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS, FUNDING TO SUPPORT NEW RECEIVABLES ORIGINATED BY OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL, THE FUNDING OF PENSION PLANS, AND FUNDING FOR SHARE REPURCHASES AND ACQUISITIONS, IF AND AS THEY ARISE. SNAP-ON INTENDS TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS OF $9.4  MILLION TO ITS FOREIGN PENSION PLANS AND $2.0  MILLION TO ITS DOMESTIC PENSION PLANS IN  2019  , AS REQUIRED BY LAW. IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  , SNAP-ON MADE $25.0  MILLION OF DISCRETIONARY CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS DOMESTIC PENSION PLANS; DEPENDING ON MARKET AND OTHER CONDITIONS, SNAP\u2010ON MAY MAKE ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLANS IN THE BALANCE OF  2019.

SNAP-ON HAS PAID CONSECUTIVE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS, WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR REDUCTION, SINCE 1939.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS OF  JUNE 29, 2019.

HISTORICALLY, THE INDUSTRY THAT PROVIDED THE TOOLS USED BY IC ENGINEERS WAS REFERRED TO AS ELECTRONIC DESIGN AUTOMATION (\u201cEDA\u201d). TODAY, OUR OFFERINGS INCLUDE AND EXTEND BEYOND EDA.  WE COMBINE OUR PRODUCTS INTO CATEGORIES RELATED TO MAJOR DESIGN ACTIVITIES.  \u2022  FUNCTIONAL VERIFICATION, INCLUDING EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE;  \u2022  DIGITAL IC DESIGN AND SIGNOFF;  \u2022  CUSTOM IC DESIGN AND SIMULATION;  \u2022  SYSTEM INTERCONNECT AND ANALYSIS; AND  \u2022  IP.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN ITEM 1, \u201cBUSINESS,\u201d UNDER THE HEADING \u201cPRODUCTS AND PRODUCT STRATEGY,\u201d IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018.  WE HAVE IDENTIFIED CERTAIN ITEMS THAT MANAGEMENT USES AS PERFORMANCE INDICATORS TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING REVENUE, CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF OPERATING EXPENSES AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AND WE DESCRIBE THESE ITEMS FURTHER BELOW UNDER THE HEADINGS \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d AND \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.\u201d  19  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  IN PREPARING OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE MAKE ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES THAT CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR REVENUE, OPERATING INCOME AND NET INCOME, AS WELL AS ON THE VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WE BASE OUR ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, WE EVALUATE OUR ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES, AND MAKE CHANGES AS DEEMED NECESSARY. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN ITEM 7, \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d UNDER THE HEADING \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\u201d IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018.  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED  CREDIT LOSSES  IN JUNE 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d) ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13, \u201cMEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,\u201d WHICH SUPERSEDES CURRENT GUIDANCE REQUIRING RECOGNITION OF CREDIT LOSSES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. THE NEW STANDARD REQUIRES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL ASSETS, INCLUDING TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, AT EACH REPORTING DATE. THE NEW STANDARD WILL RESULT IN EARLIER RECOGNITION OF ALLOWANCES FOR LOSSES ON TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS TO RECEIVE CASH. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING THIS STANDARD TO ASSESS THE IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURES.  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT  IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-04, \u201cSIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT,\u201d THAT ELIMINATES \u201cSTEP 2\u201d FROM THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. THE NEW STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR US IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE NEW GUIDANCE MUST BE APPLIED ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR THE RELATED DISCLOSURES.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-13, \u201cDISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK \u2014 CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT,\u201d WHICH MODIFIES THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE NEW STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR US IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-15, \u201cCUSTOMER\u2019S ACCOUNTING FOR IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED IN A CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT,\u201d WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR IMPLEMENTATION COSTS IN CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENTS. THE NEW STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR US IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING THIS STANDARD TO ASSESS THE IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  20  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , REFLECT THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  INCREASED PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE REVENUE RESULTING FROM OVERALL GROWTH IN EACH GEOGRAPHY, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA;  \u2022  INCREASED EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE COSTS RESULTING FROM INCREASED SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS;  \u2022  INCREASED SELLING COSTS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN TECHNICAL SALES SUPPORT IN RESPONSE TO OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 INCREASING TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS; AND  \u2022  CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES FOCUSED ON CREATING AND ENHANCING OUR PRODUCTS.  REVENUE  WE PRIMARILY GENERATE REVENUE FROM LICENSING OUR SOFTWARE AND IP, SELLING OR LEASING OUR EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE TECHNOLOGY, PROVIDING MAINTENANCE FOR OUR SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND IP, PROVIDING ENGINEERING SERVICES AND EARNING ROYALTIES GENERATED FROM THE USE OF OUR IP. THE TIMING OF OUR REVENUE IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE MIX OF SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND IP PRODUCTS GENERATING REVENUE IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD AND WHETHER THE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME OR AT A POINT IN TIME, UPON COMPLETION OF DELIVERY.  WE EXPECT THAT BETWEEN 85% AND 90% OF OUR REVENUE WILL BE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME DURING FISCAL 2019, WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE RESULTING REVENUE RECOGNIZED AT THE POINT IN TIME THAT CONTROL IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. REVENUE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME INCLUDES REVENUE FROM OUR SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS, SERVICES, ROYALTIES FROM CERTAIN IP ARRANGEMENTS, MAINTENANCE ON IP LICENSES AND HARDWARE, AND OPERATING LEASES OF HARDWARE. REVENUE RECOGNIZED AT A POINT IN TIME IS PRIMARILY GENERATED BY OUR SALES OF EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE AND IP LICENSES. OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THIS MIX IN ANY SINGLE FISCAL PERIOD MAY BE IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY DELIVERY OF HARDWARE AND IP PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS.  REVENUE BY PERIOD  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS OUR REVENUE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2018  AND THE CHANGE IN REVENUE BETWEEN PERIODS.

CERTAIN OF OUR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS ALLOW CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO REMIX AMONG SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS THAT INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF OUR PRODUCTS, WITH THE ACTUAL PRODUCT SELECTION AND NUMBER OF LICENSED USERS TO BE DETERMINED AT A LATER DATE. FOR THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE ESTIMATE THE ALLOCATION OF THE REVENUE TO PRODUCT GROUPS BASED UPON THE EXPECTED USAGE OF OUR PRODUCTS. THE ACTUAL USAGE OF OUR PRODUCTS BY THESE CUSTOMERS MAY DIFFER AND, IF THAT PROVES TO BE THE CASE, THE REVENUE ALLOCATION IN THE TABLE ABOVE WOULD DIFFER.

OPERATING EXPENSES  OUR OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE MARKETING AND SALES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. FACTORS THAT TEND TO CAUSE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES TO FLUCTUATE INCLUDE CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES DUE TO HIRING AND ACQUISITIONS, RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND THE IMPACT OF OUR VARIABLE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS THAT ARE DRIVEN BY OPERATING RESULTS.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION INCLUDED IN OUR OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , PRIMARILY BECAUSE SUCCESSIVE INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK BETWEEN GRANT DATES HAVE RESULTED IN HIGHER GRANT DATE FAIR VALUES FOR THE MIX OF STOCK AWARDS EXPENSED IN EACH PERIOD.  MANY OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE TRANSACTED IN VARIOUS FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE RECOGNIZE LOWER EXPENSES IN PERIODS WHEN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR STRENGTHENS IN VALUE AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES AND WE RECOGNIZE HIGHER EXPENSES WHEN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR WEAKENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES.

OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2019  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $5.8 MILLION AND $20.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION THAT VESTED OR WAS EXERCISED DURING THE PERIOD.  OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF THE  U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cTAX ACT\u201d) AND STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES ON ANTICIPATED FISCAL 2018 INCOME. OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $1.8 MILLION AND $10.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION THAT VESTED OR WAS EXERCISED DURING THE PERIOD. WE ALSO REDUCED OUR PROVISIONAL ESTIMATE FOR THE FISCAL 2017 DEEMED REPATRIATION TRANSITION TAX DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 BY $2.6 MILLION, BASED ON OUR CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF THE EARNINGS AND CASH BALANCES OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE APPLICABLE TAX AUTHORITIES.  OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES MAY BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY TAX AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS AT RATES DIFFERENT FROM THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE, RESEARCH CREDITS, THE TAX IMPACT OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, CLOSURE OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS OR SETTLEMENT OF TAX AUDITS, CHANGES IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE AND CHANGES IN TAX LAW. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS IS GENERATED BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES ORGANIZED IN IRELAND AND HUNGARY. OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR EARNINGS WERE TO BE LOWER IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT OUR FISCAL 2019 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL BE APPROXIMATELY  12%  . WE EXPECT THAT OUR QUARTERLY EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WILL VARY FROM OUR FISCAL 2019 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AS A RESULT OF RECOGNIZING THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS IN THE PERIODS WHEN THE AWARDS VEST OR ARE SETTLED AS WELL AS OTHER ITEMS THAT WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE.

OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2019  WERE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK RESULTING FROM STOCK PURCHASES UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN AND STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING THE PERIOD.  OUR PRIMARY USES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2019  WERE PAYMENTS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SALARIES AND BENEFITS, OPERATING EXPENSES, PAYMENTS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, PAYMENT OF TAXES ON VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK HELD BY EMPLOYEES, PURCHASES OF NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS AND PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  APPROXIMATELY  53%  OF OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AS OF  JUNE 29, 2019  . OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES MAY VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO THE TIMING OF COLLECTIONS AND REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. WE EXPECT THAT CURRENT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, CASH FLOWS THAT ARE GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND CASH BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, AND OTHER CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  NET WORKING CAPITAL  NET WORKING CAPITAL IS COMPRISED OF CURRENT ASSETS LESS CURRENT LIABILITIES, AS SHOWN ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE INCREASE IN OUR NET WORKING CAPITAL AS OF  JUNE 29, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND DISBURSEMENTS MADE TO VENDORS.

THE INCREASE IN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS AND TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND DISBURSEMENTS MADE TO VENDORS.

WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING PURCHASING PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, PURCHASING INTANGIBLE ASSETS, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, PURCHASING SOFTWARE LICENSES, AND MAKING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 29,  2019  JUNE 30,  2018  CHANGE  (IN MILLIONS)  CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $(269.0  )  $(193.4  )  $(75.6  )  CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND PAYMENTS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE RECORDED A LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF  $2.6 MILLION  , IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXCHANGES AND CONVERSIONS OF THE 2019 NOTES.

IN  TWO  SEPARATE OFFERINGS DURING 2017, WE ISSUED AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $345.0 MILLION  OF  4.75%  CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2022, FOR WHICH WE RECEIVED  $337.5 MILLION  , AFTER DEDUCTING THE UNDERWRITING DISCOUNT AND OFFERING EXPENSES.  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE 2022 NOTES HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF  $336.5 MILLION  AND AN UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNT OF  $8.5 MILLION.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WE ISSUED  $230.0 MILLION  OF  5.375%  CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2023, FOR WHICH WE RECEIVED  $223.7 MILLION  AFTER DEDUCTING THE UNDERWRITING DISCOUNT AND OFFERING EXPENSES. AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE 2023 NOTES HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF  $223.1 MILLION  AND AN UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNT OF  $6.9 MILLION.  CASH GENERATED FROM EQUITY OFFERINGS  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WE COMPLETED A FOLLOW-ON PUBLIC OFFERING OF  15,525,000  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING SHARES ISSUED PURSUANT TO THE UNDERWRITERS' OPTION TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHARES, AT A PRICE OF  $17.77  PER SHARE. THE AGGREGATE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING WERE  $275.9  MILLION AFTER DEDUCTING OFFERING EXPENSES.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE COMPLETED A FOLLOW-ON PUBLIC OFFERING OF  17,250,000  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING SHARES ISSUED PURSUANT TO THE UNDERWRITERS' OPTION TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHARES, AT A PRICE OF  $18.27  PER SHARE. THE AGGREGATE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING WERE  $314.8 MILLION  AFTER DEDUCTING OFFERING EXPENSES.  OTHER POTENTIAL SOURCES OF FINANCING  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF CASH CURRENTLY CONSIST OF CASH AVAILABLE, WHICH WAS  $116.5 MILLION  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS WE RECEIVE ON OUR PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS, AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SECURED DEBT ARRANGEMENTS. WE EXPECT OUR OTHER SOURCES OF CASH TO CONSIST OF CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND PREPAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL RECEIVED ON OUR PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS. SUCH PREPAYMENTS ARE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE IN ADVANCE. DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS, WE MAY UTILIZE ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS AS A SOURCE OF CASH, WHICH MAY ALSO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL SECURED DEBT ARRANGEMENTS AS WELL AS OTHER BORROWINGS SUCH AS CREDIT FACILITIES, OR CONDUCT ADDITIONAL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DEBT AND EQUITY OFFERINGS.  WE MAINTAIN POLICIES RELATING TO OUR BORROWINGS AND USE OF LEVERAGE. SEE \"LEVERAGE POLICIES\" BELOW. IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY SEEK TO RAISE FURTHER EQUITY OR DEBT CAPITAL OR ENGAGE IN OTHER FORMS OF BORROWINGS IN ORDER TO FUND FUTURE INVESTMENTS OR TO REFINANCE EXPIRING INDEBTEDNESS.  WE GENERALLY INTEND TO HOLD OUR TARGET ASSETS AS LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS, ALTHOUGH WE MAY SELL CERTAIN OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR INTEREST RATE RISK AND LIQUIDITY NEEDS, MEET OTHER OPERATING OBJECTIVES AND ADAPT TO MARKET CONDITIONS.  TO MAINTAIN OUR QUALIFICATION AS A REIT UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, WE MUST DISTRIBUTE ANNUALLY AT LEAST 90% OF OUR REIT TAXABLE INCOME, DETERMINED WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DEDUCTION FOR DIVIDENDS PAID AND EXCLUDING NET CAPITAL GAIN. THESE DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EARNINGS AND REPLENISH OR INCREASE CAPITAL FOR OPERATIONS.  LEVERAGE POLICIES  WE USE LEVERAGE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF FINANCING OUR PORTFOLIO AND NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SPECULATING ON CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. IN ADDITION TO OUR SECURED DEBT ARRANGEMENTS, IN THE FUTURE WE MAY ACCESS ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF BORROWINGS. OUR CHARTER AND BYLAWS DO NOT LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS WE CAN INCUR; HOWEVER, WE ARE LIMITED BY CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER OUR SECURED DEBT ARRANGEMENTS. CONSISTENT WITH OUR STRATEGY OF KEEPING LEVERAGE WITHIN A PRUDENT RANGE, WE EXPECT TO, DEPENDING UPON THE COMPOSITION OF OUR PORTFOLIO, MAINTAIN OUR DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO AT LESS THAN 2.0X.  INVESTMENT GUIDELINES  OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT GUIDELINES, APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, ARE COMPRISED OF THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  NO INVESTMENT WILL BE MADE THAT WOULD CAUSE US TO FAIL TO QUALIFY AS A REIT FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES;  \u2022  NO INVESTMENT WILL BE MADE THAT WOULD CAUSE US TO REGISTER AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE 1940 ACT;  \u2022  INVESTMENTS WILL BE PREDOMINANTLY IN OUR TARGET ASSETS;  \u2022  NO MORE THAN 20% OF OUR CASH EQUITY (ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS) WILL BE INVESTED IN ANY SINGLE INVESTMENT AT THE TIME OF THE INVESTMENT; AND  \u2022  UNTIL APPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS CAN BE IDENTIFIED, THE MANAGER MAY INVEST THE PROCEEDS OF ANY OFFERING IN INTEREST BEARING, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS AND/OR FUNDS, THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR INTENTION TO QUALIFY AS A REIT.  31  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MUST APPROVE ANY CHANGE IN THESE INVESTMENT GUIDELINES.

(4)  BASED ON OUR EXPECTED FUNDING SCHEDULE, WHICH IS BASED UPON THE MANAGER\u2019S ESTIMATES BASED UPON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE MANAGER AT THE TIME. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE PAYMENTS WILL OCCUR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE ESTIMATES OR AT ALL, WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  LOAN COMMITMENTS.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE HAD  $1.2 BILLION  OF UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS, COMPRISED OF  $1.1 BILLION  RELATED TO OUR COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIO, AND  $75.2 MILLION  RELATED TO OUR SUBORDINATE LOAN PORTFOLIO.  MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2009, WE ENTERED INTO THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE MANAGER PURSUANT TO WHICH THE MANAGER IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A MANAGEMENT FEE AND THE REIMBURSEMENT OF CERTAIN EXPENSES. THE TABLE ABOVE DOES NOT INCLUDE AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AS THOSE OBLIGATIONS DO NOT HAVE FIXED AND DETERMINABLE PAYMENTS. PURSUANT TO THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, THE MANAGER IS ENTITLED TO A BASE MANAGEMENT FEE CALCULATED AND PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ARREARS IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO 1.5% OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY (AS DEFINED IN THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT), PER ANNUM. THE MANAGER WILL USE THE PROCEEDS FROM ITS MANAGEMENT FEE IN PART TO PAY COMPENSATION TO ITS OFFICERS AND PERSONNEL. WE DO NOT REIMBURSE THE MANAGER OR ITS AFFILIATES FOR THE SALARIES AND OTHER COMPENSATION OF THEIR PERSONNEL, EXCEPT FOR THE ALLOCABLE SHARE OF THE COMPENSATION OF (1) OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME SPENT ON OUR AFFAIRS AND (2) OTHER CORPORATE FINANCE, TAX, ACCOUNTING, INTERNAL AUDIT, LEGAL, RISK MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONS, COMPLIANCE AND OTHER NON-INVESTMENT PROFESSIONAL PERSONNEL OF THE MANAGER OR ITS AFFILIATES WHO SPEND ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR TIME MANAGING OUR AFFAIRS BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME DEVOTED BY SUCH PERSONNEL TO OUR AFFAIRS. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE MANAGER FOR OPERATING EXPENSES RELATED TO US INCURRED BY THE MANAGER, INCLUDING EXPENSES RELATING TO LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, DUE DILIGENCE AND OTHER SERVICES. EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS TO THE MANAGER ARE MADE IN CASH ON A MONTHLY BASIS FOLLOWING THE END OF EACH MONTH. OUR REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION IS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY DOLLAR LIMITATION.  THE CURRENT TERM OF THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT CURRENTLY RUNS THROUGH SEPTEMBER 29, 2019. ABSENT CERTAIN ACTION BY THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW ON EACH ANNIVERSARY FOR A ONE-YEAR TERM. THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT MAY BE TERMINATED UPON EXPIRATION OF THE ONE-YEAR TERM ONLY UPON THE AFFIRMATIVE VOTE OF AT LEAST TWO-THIRDS OF OUR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, BASED UPON (1) UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE BY THE MANAGER THAT IS MATERIALLY DETRIMENTAL TO US OR (2) A DETERMINATION THAT THE MANAGEMENT FEE PAYABLE TO THE MANAGER IS NOT FAIR, SUBJECT TO THE MANAGER\u2019S RIGHT TO PREVENT SUCH A TERMINATION BASED ON UNFAIR FEES BY ACCEPTING A MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE REDUCTION OF MANAGEMENT FEES AGREED TO BY AT LEAST TWO-THIRDS OF OUR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS. THE MANAGER MUST BE PROVIDED WITH WRITTEN NOTICE OF ANY SUCH TERMINATION AT LEAST 180 DAYS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE THEN EXISTING TERM AND WILL BE PAID A TERMINATION FEE EQUAL TO THREE TIMES THE SUM OF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL BASE MANAGEMENT FEE DURING THE 24-MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE OF TERMINATION, CALCULATED AS OF THE END OF THE MOST RECENTLY COMPLETED FISCAL QUARTER PRIOR TO THE DATE OF TERMINATION. AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT ARE NOT FIXED AND DETERMINABLE. FOLLOWING A MEETING BY OUR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS IN FEBRUARY 2019, WHICH INCLUDED A DISCUSSION OF THE MANAGER\u2019S PERFORMANCE AND THE LEVEL OF THE MANAGEMENT FEES THEREUNDER, WE DETERMINED NOT TO TERMINATE THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  FORWARD CURRENCY CONTRACTS.  WE USE FORWARD CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS DUE UNDER OUR LOANS DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A SERIES OF FORWARD CONTRACTS TO SELL AN AMOUNT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY (BRITISH POUNDS AND EUROS) FOR AN AGREED UPON AMOUNT OF U.S. DOLLARS AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH DECEMBER 2021. THESE FORWARD CONTRACTS WERE EXECUTED TO ECONOMICALLY FIX THE U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF FOREIGN DENOMINATED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED BY US RELATED TO FOREIGN DENOMINATED LOAN INVESTMENTS. REFER TO \"  NOTE 10  - DERIVATIVES, NET\"  32  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DETAILS REGARDING OUR FORWARD CURRENCY CONTRACTS.  UNREALIZED LOSS ON INTEREST RATE SWAP.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE TERM LOAN B, WE ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP TO FIX LIBOR AT  2.12%  , EFFECTIVELY FIXING OUR ALL-IN COUPON ON THE TERM LOAN B AT  4.87%  . REFER TO \"  NOTE 10  - DERIVATIVES, NET\" TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DETAILS REGARDING OUR INTEREST RATE SWAP.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS STRUCTURED INVESTMENT VEHICLES, OR SPECIAL PURPOSE OR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, ESTABLISHED TO FACILITATE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES. FURTHER, WE HAVE NOT GUARANTEED ANY OBLIGATIONS OF UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR ENTERED INTO ANY COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ANY SUCH ENTITIES.  DIVIDENDS  WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MAKE REGULAR QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK. U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAW GENERALLY REQUIRES THAT A REIT DISTRIBUTE ANNUALLY AT LEAST 90% OF OUR REIT TAXABLE INCOME, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DEDUCTION FOR DIVIDENDS PAID AND EXCLUDING NET CAPITAL GAINS, AND THAT WE PAY TAX AT REGULAR CORPORATE RATES TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ANNUALLY DISTRIBUTE LESS THAN 100% OF OUR NET TAXABLE INCOME. WE GENERALLY INTEND OVER TIME TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO OUR NET TAXABLE INCOME, IF AND TO THE EXTENT AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ANY DISTRIBUTIONS WE MAKE ARE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DEPEND UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE RESULTS AND OUR ABILITY TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE NET INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME FROM OUR PORTFOLIO, OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND ANY OTHER EXPENDITURES. IF OUR CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION IS LESS THAN OUR NET TAXABLE INCOME, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO SELL ASSETS OR BORROW FUNDS TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS OR WE MAY MAKE A PORTION OF THE REQUIRED DISTRIBUTION IN THE FORM OF A TAXABLE STOCK DISTRIBUTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF DEBT SECURITIES.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE HAD  6,770,393  SHARES OF SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK OUTSTANDING, WHICH ENTITLES HOLDERS TO RECEIVE DIVIDENDS THAT ARE PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ARREARS. THE SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK PAY CUMULATIVE CASH DIVIDENDS, WHICH ARE PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN EQUAL AMOUNTS IN ARREARS ON THE 15TH DAY OF EACH JANUARY, APRIL, JULY AND OCTOBER: (I) FROM, AND INCLUDING, THE ORIGINAL DATE OF ISSUANCE OF THE SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK TO, BUT EXCLUDING, SEPTEMBER 20, 2020, AT AN INITIAL RATE OF 8.00% PER ANNUM OF THE $25.00 PER SHARE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE; AND (II) FROM, AND INCLUDING, SEPTEMBER 20, 2020, AT THE RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF (A) 8.00% AND (B) A FLOATING RATE EQUAL TO THE 3-MONTH LIBOR RATE AS CALCULATED ON EACH APPLICABLE DATE OF DETERMINATION PLUS 6.46% OF THE $25.00 LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE. EXCEPT UNDER CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, THE SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK IS GENERALLY NOT CONVERTIBLE INTO OR EXCHANGEABLE FOR ANY OTHER PROPERTY OR ANY OTHER OF OUR SECURITIES AT THE ELECTION OF THE HOLDERS. ON OR AFTER SEPTEMBER 21, 2020, WE MAY, AT OUR OPTION, REDEEM THE SHARES AT A REDEMPTION PRICE OF $25.00, PLUS ANY ACCRUED UNPAID DISTRIBUTION THROUGH THE DATE OF THE REDEMPTION.  ON JUNE 10, 2019, WE REDEEMED ALL 6,900,000 SHARES OF SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK OUTSTANDING. HOLDERS OF THE SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK RECEIVED THE REDEMPTION PRICE OF $25.00 PLUS ACCUMULATED BUT UNPAID DIVIDENDS TO THE REDEMPTION DATE OF  $0.2223.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  OPERATING EARNINGS  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , OUR OPERATING EARNINGS WERE  $56.6 MILLION  , OR  $0.38  PER SHARE, AND  $125.0 MILLION  , OR  $0.88  PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO  $54.9 MILLION  , OR  $0.44  PER SHARE, AND  $102.9 MILLION  , OR  $0.87  PER SHARE, FOR THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, RESPECTIVELY. OPERATING EARNINGS IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT WE DEFINE AS NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS, COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, ADJUSTED FOR (I) EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE (A PORTION OF WHICH MAY BECOME CASH-BASED UPON FINAL VESTING AND SETTLEMENT OF AWARDS SHOULD THE HOLDER ELECT NET SHARE SETTLEMENT TO SATISFY INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING), (II) ANY UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES OR OTHER NON-CASH ITEMS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS, (III) UNREALIZED INCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES, (IV) FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS (LOSSES), OTHER THAN (A) REALIZED GAINS/(LOSSES) RELATED TO INTEREST INCOME, AND (B) FORWARD POINT GAINS/(LOSSES) REALIZED ON OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES, (V) THE NON-CASH AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF A PORTION OF THE NOTES TO STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AND (VI) PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES AND IMPAIRMENTS. BEGINNING WITH THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016, WE SLIGHTLY MODIFIED OUR DEFINITION OF OPERATING EARNINGS TO INCLUDE REALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) ON CURRENCY SWAPS RELATED TO INTEREST INCOME ON INVESTMENTS DENOMINATED IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN U.S. DOLLARS. IN ADDITION, BEGINNING WITH THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE FURTHER MODIFIED OUR DEFINITION OF OPERATING EARNINGS TO INCLUDE THE IMPACT FROM FORWARD POINTS ON OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES, WHICH REFLECT THE INTEREST RATE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN THE APPLICABLE BASE RATE FOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY INVESTMENTS AND USD LIBOR. THESE FORWARD CONTRACTS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT THE RATE EXPOSURE TO USD LIBOR, RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL INTEREST INCOME EARNED IN U.S. DOLLAR TERMS. THESE AMOUNTS ARE  33  NOT INCLUDED IN GAAP NET INCOME. IN ORDER TO CONFORM TO THE 2018 YEAR-END PRESENTATION, WHICH INCORPORATES THIS MODIFICATION, PRIOR-YEAR OPERATING EARNINGS RESULTS PRESENTED BELOW HAVE BEEN MODIFIED ACCORDINGLY. OPERATING EARNINGS MAY ALSO BE ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN OTHER NON-CASH ITEMS, AS DETERMINED BY THE MANAGER AND APPROVED BY A MAJORITY OF OUR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS.  THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING USED FOR OPERATING EARNINGS PER WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARE HAS BEEN ADJUSTED FROM WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES UNDER GAAP TO EXCLUDE SHARES ISSUED FROM A POTENTIAL CONVERSION OF THE NOTES. CONSISTENT WITH THE TREATMENT OF OTHER UNREALIZED ADJUSTMENTS TO OPERATING EARNINGS, THESE POTENTIALLY ISSUABLE SHARES ARE EXCLUDED UNTIL A CONVERSION OCCURS, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A USEFUL PRESENTATION FOR INVESTORS. WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING SHARES ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH A POTENTIAL CONVERSION OF THE NOTES FROM OUR COMPUTATION OF OPERATING EARNINGS PER WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS FOR VARIOUS REASONS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: (I) CONVERSION OF NOTES TO SHARES REQUIRES BOTH THE HOLDER OF A NOTE TO ELECT TO CONVERT THE NOTE AND FOR US TO ELECT TO SETTLE THE CONVERSION IN THE FORM OF SHARES; (II) FUTURE CONVERSION DECISIONS BY NOTE HOLDERS WILL BE BASED ON OUR STOCK PRICE IN THE FUTURE, WHICH IS PRESENTLY NOT DETERMINABLE; (III) THE EXCLUSION OF SHARES ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH A POTENTIAL CONVERSION OF THE NOTES FROM THE COMPUTATION OF OPERATING EARNINGS PER WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARE IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW WE TREAT OTHER UNREALIZED ITEMS IN OUR COMPUTATION OF OPERATING EARNINGS PER WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARE; AND (IV) WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN EVALUATING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, INVESTORS AND POTENTIAL INVESTORS CONSIDER OUR OPERATING EARNINGS RELATIVE TO OUR ACTUAL DISTRIBUTIONS, WHICH ARE BASED ON SHARES OUTSTANDING AND NOT SHARES THAT MIGHT BE ISSUED IN THE FUTURE. THE TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES THE RECONCILIATION FROM WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES UNDER GAAP TO THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES USED FOR OPERATING EARNINGS ($ IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PRICE).

OPERATING EARNINGS ALLOWS US TO ISOLATE THE NET INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SWAPS IN ORDER TO MONITOR AND PROJECT OUR FULL COST OF BORROWINGS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTORS USE OPERATING EARNINGS, OR A COMPARABLE SUPPLEMENTAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE, TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR COMPANY AND OUR PEERS AND, AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE THAT THE DISCLOSURE OF OPERATING EARNINGS IS USEFUL TO OUR INVESTORS. FORWARD POINTS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT OUR FOREIGN RATE EXPOSURE TO USD LIBOR, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A BETTER REFLECTION OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND WE BELIEVE THE INCLUSION OF THE RESULTING GAIN OR LOSS IN OPERATING EARNINGS IS USEFUL TO OUR INVESTORS. WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL TO OUR INVESTORS TO PRESENT OPERATING EARNINGS EXCLUDING REALIZED LOSS ON INVESTMENTS TO REFLECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS. OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF EARNING INTEREST INCOME ON OUR INVESTMENTS NET OF BORROWING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.  34  A SIGNIFICANT LIMITATION ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING EARNINGS AS A MEASURE OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OVER ANY PERIOD IS THAT IT EXCLUDES UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) FROM INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR PRESENTATION OF OPERATING EARNINGS MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY-TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES, WHO MAY USE DIFFERENT CALCULATIONS. AS A RESULT, OPERATING EARNINGS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OUR GAAP NET INCOME AS A MEASURE OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR ANY MEASURE OF OUR LIQUIDITY UNDER GAAP.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY EXPLORE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES CONSISTENT WITH ITS BUSINESS STRATEGY.  PROPERTY OPERATING INCOME IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANY DEFINES PROPERTY OPERATING INCOME AS OPERATING REVENUES (BASE RENT AND RECOVERIES FROM TENANTS), LESS PROPERTY AND RELATED EXPENSES (PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES AND PROPERTY TAXES). PROPERTY OPERATING INCOME EXCLUDES GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, ACQUISITION TRANSACTION COSTS, OTHER EXPENSE, INTEREST EXPENSE, GAINS AND LOSSES FROM PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS, EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS, TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND LEASING COMMISSIONS.

PROPERTY OPERATING INCOME IS A MEASURE OF THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PROPERTIES BUT DOES NOT MEASURE THE COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE AS A WHOLE. PROPERTY OPERATING INCOME IS THEREFORE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR OPERATING INCOME AS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  -  29  -  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.

FFO IS FREQUENTLY USED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS, INVESTORS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF REITS, MOST OF WHICH PRESENT FFO ALONG WITH NET INCOME AS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE COMPANY COMPUTES FFO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE \u201cWHITE PAPER\u201d ON FFO PUBLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\u201cNAREIT\u201d), WHICH DEFINES FFO AS NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS (DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP) EXCLUDING GAINS OR LOSSES FROM DEBT RESTRUCTURING, SALES OF DEPRECIABLE PROPERTY, AND IMPAIRMENTS, PLUS REAL ESTATE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND AFTER ADJUSTMENTS FOR PARTNERSHIPS AND UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES.  HOWEVER, FFO.  \u2022  DOES NOT REPRESENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP (WHICH, UNLIKE FFO, GENERALLY REFLECTS ALL CASH EFFECTS OF TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER EVENTS IN THE DETERMINATION OF NET INCOME); AND  \u2022  SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET INCOME AS AN INDICATION OF OUR PERFORMANCE.  FFO AS DEFINED BY THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED ITEMS REPORTED BY OTHER REITS DUE TO POSSIBLE DIFFERENCES IN THE APPLICATION OF THE NAREIT DEFINITION USED BY SUCH REITS.  THE TABLE BELOW PROVIDES A RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO STOCKHOLDERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP TO FFO FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  (IN THOUSANDS).

THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS OPERATING INCOME. THE COMPANY DEFINES CASH NOI AS OPERATING REVENUES (BASE RENT AND RECOVERIES FROM TENANTS), LESS PROPERTY AND RELATED EXPENSES (PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES AND PROPERTY TAXES), ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH REVENUE AND OPERATING EXPENSE ITEMS SUCH AS STRAIGHT-LINE RENT AND AMORTIZATION OF LEASE INTANGIBLES, DEBT-RELATED EXPENSES, AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. CASH NOI ALSO EXCLUDES GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, ACQUISITION TRANSACTION COSTS, OTHER EXPENSE, INTEREST EXPENSE, GAINS AND LOSSES FROM PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS, EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS, TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND LEASING COMMISSIONS. OTHER REITS MAY USE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES FOR CALCULATING CASH NOI, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH NOI MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER REITS.  CASH NOI IS USED BY MANAGEMENT INTERNALLY TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PROPERTIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES CASH NOI PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS REGARDING THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BECAUSE IT REFLECTS ONLY THOSE CASH INCOME AND EXPENSE ITEMS THAT ARE INCURRED AT THE PROPERTY LEVEL, AND WHEN COMPARED ACROSS PERIODS, CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE TRENDS IN EARNINGS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PROPERTIES AS THIS MEASURE IS NOT AFFECTED BY NON-CASH REVENUE AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION ITEMS, THE COST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FUNDING, THE IMPACT OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES, GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THE ACQUISITION AND SALE OF OPERATING REAL ESTATE ASSETS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OR OTHER GAINS AND LOSSES THAT RELATE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE EXCLUSION OF THESE ITEMS FROM OPERATING INCOME IS USEFUL BECAUSE THE RESULTING MEASURE CAPTURES THE ACTUAL REVENUE GENERATED AND ACTUAL EXPENSES INCURRED IN OPERATING THE COMPANY\u2019S PROPERTIES AS WELL AS TRENDS IN OCCUPANCY RATES, RENTAL RATES AND OPERATING COSTS.  -  34  -  CASH NOI IS A MEASURE OF THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PROPERTIES BUT DOES NOT MEASURE THE COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE AS A WHOLE AND IS THEREFORE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR OPERATING INCOME AS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  SAME-CENTER CASH NOI  THE TABLE BELOW PROVIDES A RECONCILIATION OF SAME-CENTER CASH NOI TO CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  . THE TABLE MAKES REFERENCE TO THE EFFECT OF THE SAME-CENTER PROPERTIES.

DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY GENERATED SAME-CENTER CASH NOI OF APPROXIMATELY  $49.3 MILLION  COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY  $47.1 MILLION  GENERATED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  , REPRESENTING A  4.6%  INCREASE  .  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY GENERATED SAME-CENTER CASH NOI OF APPROXIMATELY  $97.2 MILLION  COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY  $93.6 MILLION  GENERATED DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  , REPRESENTING A  3.8%  INCREASE  .  THESE INCREASES ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BASE RENTS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE THAT ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PRESENTATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND REQUIRE MANAGEMENT\u2019S MOST DIFFICULT, COMPLEX OR SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS. SET FORTH BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE CRITICAL TO THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS SUMMARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MORE COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ACCOUNTING POLICIES INCLUDED IN NOTE 1 TO ROIC\u2019S AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  THE COMPANY RECORDS BASE RENTS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF EACH LEASE. THE EXCESS OF RENTS RECOGNIZED OVER AMOUNTS CONTRACTUALLY DUE PURSUANT TO THE UNDERLYING LEASES IS INCLUDED IN TENANT AND OTHER RECEIVABLES ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. MOST LEASES CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE TENANTS TO REIMBURSE A PRO-RATA SHARE OF REAL ESTATE TAXES AND CERTAIN COMMON AREA EXPENSES. ADJUSTMENTS ARE ALSO MADE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TO TENANT AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND THE RELATED COST RECOVERY INCOME BASED UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S BEST ESTIMATE OF THE FINAL AMOUNTS TO BE BILLED AND COLLECTED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES AN ALLOWANCE FOR FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEFERRED STRAIGHT-LINE RENT RECEIVABLE.  -  35  -  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS  THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS IS ESTABLISHED BASED ON A QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON SPECIFIC ACCOUNTS. THE ANALYSIS PLACES PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON PAST-DUE ACCOUNTS AND CONSIDERS INFORMATION SUCH AS THE NATURE AND AGE OF THE RECEIVABLES, THE PAYMENT HISTORY OF THE TENANTS OR OTHER DEBTORS, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE TENANTS AND ANY GUARANTORS AND MANAGEMENT\u2019S ASSESSMENT OF THEIR ABILITY TO MEET THEIR LEASE OBLIGATIONS, THE BASIS FOR ANY DISPUTES AND THE STATUS OF RELATED NEGOTIATIONS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATES OF THE REQUIRED ALLOWANCE IS SUBJECT TO REVISION AS THESE FACTORS CHANGE AND IS SENSITIVE TO THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS ON TENANTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE AT RETAIL PROPERTIES. ESTIMATES ARE USED TO ESTABLISH REIMBURSEMENTS FROM TENANTS FOR COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE, REAL ESTATE TAX AND INSURANCE COSTS. THE COMPANY ANALYZES THE BALANCE OF ITS ESTIMATED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE AND INSURANCE FOR EACH OF ITS PROPERTIES BY COMPARING ACTUAL RECOVERIES VERSUS ACTUAL EXPENSES AND ANY ACTUAL WRITE-OFFS. BASED ON ITS ANALYSIS, THE COMPANY MAY RECORD AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT IN ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS RELATED TO THESE ITEMS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES AN ALLOWANCE FOR FUTURE CREDIT LOSSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEFERRED STRAIGHT-LINE RENT RECEIVABLE.  REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS  LAND, BUILDINGS, PROPERTY IMPROVEMENTS, FURNITURE/FIXTURES AND TENANT IMPROVEMENTS ARE RECORDED AT COST.  EXPENDITURES FOR MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS AS INCURRED.  RENOVATIONS AND/OR REPLACEMENTS, WHICH IMPROVE OR EXTEND THE LIFE OF THE ASSET, ARE CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES.  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE ACQUISITION OF REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING ACQUIRED TANGIBLE ASSETS (CONSISTING OF LAND, BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS) AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (CONSISTING OF ABOVE-MARKET AND BELOW-MARKET LEASES AND ACQUIRED IN-PLACE LEASES) AT THEIR FAIR VALUE (FOR ACQUISITIONS MEETING THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS) AND RELATIVE FAIR VALUE (FOR ACQUISITIONS NOT MEETING THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS).  ACQUIRED LEASE INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDE ABOVE-MARKET LEASES AND ACQUIRED IN-PLACE LEASES, AND ACQUIRED LEASE INTANGIBLE LIABILITIES REPRESENT BELOW-MARKET LEASES, IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TANGIBLE ASSETS OF AN ACQUIRED PROPERTY IS DETERMINED BY VALUING THE PROPERTY AS IF IT WERE VACANT, WHICH VALUE IS THEN ALLOCATED TO LAND, BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S DETERMINATION OF THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS.  IN VALUING AN ACQUIRED PROPERTY\u2019S INTANGIBLES, FACTORS CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT INCLUDE AN ESTIMATE OF CARRYING COSTS DURING THE EXPECTED LEASE-UP PERIODS, AND ESTIMATES OF LOST RENTAL REVENUE DURING THE EXPECTED LEASE-UP PERIODS BASED ON ITS EVALUATION OF CURRENT MARKET DEMAND.  MANAGEMENT ALSO ESTIMATES COSTS TO EXECUTE SIMILAR LEASES, INCLUDING LEASING COMMISSIONS, TENANT IMPROVEMENTS, LEGAL AND OTHER RELATED COSTS.  THE VALUE OF IN-PLACE LEASES IS MEASURED BY THE EXCESS OF (I) THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR A PROPERTY AFTER ADJUSTING EXISTING IN-PLACE LEASES TO MARKET RENTAL RATES, OVER (II) THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTY AS IF VACANT.  ABOVE-MARKET AND BELOW-MARKET LEASE VALUES ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE (USING A DISCOUNT RATE WHICH REFLECTS THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEASES ACQUIRED) OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS TO BE RECEIVED AND MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATE OF MARKET LEASE RATES, MEASURED OVER THE TERMS OF THE RESPECTIVE LEASES THAT MANAGEMENT DEEMED APPROPRIATE AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION.  SUCH VALUATIONS INCLUDE A CONSIDERATION OF THE NON-CANCELLABLE TERMS OF THE RESPECTIVE LEASES AS WELL AS ANY APPLICABLE RENEWAL PERIODS.  THE FAIR VALUES ASSOCIATED WITH BELOW-MARKET RENTAL RENEWAL OPTIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPERIENCE AND THE RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXISTED AT THE TIME OF THE ACQUISITIONS.  THE VALUE OF THE ABOVE-MARKET AND BELOW-MARKET LEASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ORIGINAL LEASE TERM IS AMORTIZED TO RENTAL INCOME, OVER THE TERMS OF THE RESPECTIVE LEASES. THE VALUE OF IN-PLACE LEASES ARE AMORTIZED TO EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING NON-CANCELLABLE TERMS OF THE RESPECTIVE LEASES.  IF A LEASE WERE TO BE TERMINATED PRIOR TO ITS STATED EXPIRATION, ALL UNAMORTIZED AMOUNTS RELATING TO THAT LEASE WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN OPERATIONS AT THAT TIME.  THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO MAKE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENTS AS TO THE USEFUL LIFE OF ITS PROPERTIES FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF DEPRECIATION. THESE ASSESSMENTS HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S NET INCOME.  PROPERTIES ARE DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS.  BUILDINGS (YEARS)  39  \u2014  40  BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS (YEARS)  10  \u2014  20  FURNITURE/FIXTURES (YEARS)  3  \u2014  10  TENANT IMPROVEMENTS  SHORTER OF LEASE TERM OR THEIR USEFUL LIFE  -  36  -  ASSET IMPAIRMENT  THE COMPANY REVIEWS LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED IS MEASURED BY A COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET TO AGGREGATE FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS (UNDISCOUNTED AND WITHOUT INTEREST) EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSET. IF SUCH ASSETS ARE CONSIDERED IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF THE ASSETS EXCEED THE FAIR VALUE. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE VALUE OF ANY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS WAS IMPAIRED AT  JUNE 30, 2019.  REIT QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS  THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED AND QUALIFIED TO BE TAXED AS A REIT UNDER THE CODE, AND BELIEVES THAT IT HAS BEEN ORGANIZED AND HAS OPERATED IN A MANNER THAT WILL ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE TO QUALIFY FOR TAXATION AS A REIT UNDER THE CODE.  THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF OPERATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY AND THEN MAINTAIN QUALIFICATION AS A REIT.  IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT QUALIFY AS A REIT, ITS INCOME WOULD BECOME SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES AT REGULAR CORPORATE RATES THAT WOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL AND ROIC MAY NOT BE PERMITTED TO RE-ELECT TO QUALIFY AS A REIT FOR FOUR TAXABLE YEARS FOLLOWING THE YEAR THAT IT FAILED TO QUALIFY AS A REIT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY AND AMOUNTS DISTRIBUTABLE TO STOCKHOLDERS WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IF IT FAILED TO QUALIFY AS A REIT.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY  IN THIS \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY\u201d SECTION AND IN THE \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u201d SECTION, THE TERM \u201cTHE COMPANY\u201d REFERS TO RETAIL OPPORTUNITY INVESTMENTS CORP. ON AN UNCONSOLIDATED BASIS, EXCLUDING THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS IS OPERATED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, OF WHICH THE COMPANY IS THE PARENT COMPANY AND WHICH IT CONSOLIDATES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. BECAUSE THE COMPANY OPERATES ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS WITH THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u201d SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS SECTION TO UNDERSTAND THE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AND HOW THE COMPANY IS OPERATED AS A WHOLE.  THE COMPANY ISSUES PUBLIC EQUITY FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT DOES NOT OTHERWISE GENERATE ANY CAPITAL ITSELF OR CONDUCT ANY BUSINESS ITSELF, OTHER THAN INCURRING CERTAIN EXPENSES IN OPERATING AS A PUBLIC COMPANY. THE COMPANY ITSELF DOES NOT HOLD ANY INDEBTEDNESS OTHER THAN GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, AND ITS ONLY MATERIAL ASSETS ARE ITS OWNERSHIP OF DIRECT OR INDIRECT PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN RETAIL OPPORTUNITY INVESTMENTS GP, LLC, THE SOLE GENERAL PARTNER OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. THEREFORE, THE CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF THE COMPANY AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP ARE THE SAME ON THEIR RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. HOWEVER, ALL DEBT IS HELD DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. THE COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL FUNDING REQUIREMENT IS THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK. THE COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ITS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IS DISTRIBUTIONS IT RECEIVES FROM THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  AS THE PARENT COMPANY OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, THE COMPANY, INDIRECTLY, HAS THE FULL, EXCLUSIVE AND COMPLETE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL. THE COMPANY CAUSES THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO DISTRIBUTE SUCH PORTION OF ITS AVAILABLE CASH AS THE COMPANY MAY IN ITS DISCRETION DETERMINE, IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT.  THE COMPANY IS A WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER WITH AN EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED IN MAY 2019 THAT ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO REGISTER UNSPECIFIED VARIOUS CLASSES OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE EQUITY FROM TIME TO TIME ON AN OPPORTUNISTIC BASIS, DEPENDENT UPON MARKET CONDITIONS AND AVAILABLE PRICING. ANY PROCEEDS FROM SUCH EQUITY ISSUANCES WOULD BE CONTRIBUTED TO THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP MAY USE THE PROCEEDS TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES, PAY DOWN DEBT, AND FOR GENERAL WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES.  LIQUIDITY IS A MEASURE OF THE ABILITY TO MEET POTENTIAL CASH REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING ONGOING COMMITMENTS TO REPAY BORROWINGS, FUND AND MAINTAIN ITS ASSETS AND OPERATIONS, MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS AND MEET OTHER GENERAL BUSINESS NEEDS.  THE LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S ABILITY TO MAKE SUFFICIENT DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY. THE PRIMARY CASH REQUIREMENT OF THE COMPANY IS ITS PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS.  -  37  -  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S PRIMARY SOURCE OF CASH WAS DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT IT HAS ADEQUATE WORKING CAPITAL TO MEET ITS DIVIDEND FUNDING OBLIGATIONS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.

AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS DETERMINED THAT IT HAS ADEQUATE WORKING CAPITAL TO MEET ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2015, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A TERM LOAN AGREEMENT.

PURSUANT TO THE LEASE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY IS PROVIDED THE USE OF STORAGE SPACE.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  REAL ESTATE TAXES  THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASES GENERALLY REQUIRE THE TENANTS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A PRO RATA PORTION OF THE REAL ESTATE TAXES.  INFLATION  THE COMPANY\u2019S LONG-TERM LEASES CONTAIN PROVISIONS TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON ITS OPERATING RESULTS.  SUCH PROVISIONS INCLUDE CLAUSES ENTITLING THE COMPANY TO RECEIVE (A) SCHEDULED BASE RENT INCREASES AND (B) PERCENTAGE RENTS BASED UPON TENANTS\u2019 GROSS SALES WHICH GENERALLY INCREASE AS PRICES RISE.  IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S NON-ANCHOR LEASES ARE FOR TERMS OF LESS THAN TEN YEARS, WHICH PERMITS THE COMPANY TO SEEK INCREASES IN RENTS UPON RENEWAL AT THEN-CURRENT MARKET RATES IF RENTS PROVIDED IN THE EXPIRING LEASES ARE BELOW THEN-EXISTING MARKET RATES.  MOST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASES REQUIRE TENANTS TO PAY A SHARE OF OPERATING EXPENSES, INCLUDING COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE, REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE AND UTILITIES, THEREBY REDUCING THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPOSURE TO INCREASES IN COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES RESULTING FROM INFLATION.  -  40  -  LEVERAGE POLICIES  THE COMPANY EMPLOYS PRUDENT AMOUNTS OF LEVERAGE AND USES DEBT AS A MEANS OF PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF ITS PROPERTIES AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF ITS PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANY SEEKS TO PRIMARILY UTILIZE UNSECURED DEBT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY AND FLEXIBILITY IN ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE.  ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2015, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A TERM LOAN AGREEMENT. EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 8, 2017, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED TERM LOAN AGREEMENT (THE \u201cTERM LOAN AGREEMENT\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH THE MATURITY DATE OF THE TERM LOAN WAS EXTENDED FROM JANUARY 31, 2019 TO SEPTEMBER 8, 2022, WITHOUT FURTHER OPTIONS FOR EXTENSION. THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDES THAT THE COMPANY MAY FROM TIME TO TIME REQUEST INCREASED AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS OF $200.0 MILLION UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE CONSENT OF THE LENDERS FOR THE ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS. THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS AN UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH SEVERAL BANKS. EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 8, 2017, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS INCREASED FROM $500.0 MILLION TO $600.0 MILLION. THE MATURITY DATE OF THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS EXTENDED FROM JANUARY 31, 2019 TO SEPTEMBER 8, 2021, WITH TWO SIX-MONTH EXTENSION OPTIONS, WHICH MAY BE EXERCISED BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP UPON SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS INCLUDING THE PAYMENT OF EXTENSION FEES. ADDITIONALLY, THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS AN ACCORDION FEATURE, WHICH ALLOWS THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO INCREASE THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY UP TO AN AGGREGATE OF $1.2 BILLION, SUBJECT TO LENDER CONSENTS AND OTHER CONDITIONS.  FURTHER, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP ISSUED $250.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES IN EACH OF DECEMBER 2017, DECEMBER 2014 AND DECEMBER 2013 AND $200.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES IN SEPTEMBER 2016, EACH OF WHICH WERE FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE ROIC.  THE COMPANY MAY BORROW ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS OR AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL OR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP LEVEL. NON-RECOURSE INDEBTEDNESS MEANS THE INDEBTEDNESS OF THE BORROWER OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES IS SECURED ONLY BY SPECIFIC ASSETS WITHOUT RECOURSE TO OTHER ASSETS OF THE BORROWER OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES. EVEN WITH NON-RECOURSE INDEBTEDNESS, HOWEVER, A BORROWER OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED TO GUARANTEE AGAINST CERTAIN BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SUCH AS THOSE RELATING TO THE ABSENCE OF FRAUD, MISAPPROPRIATION, MISAPPLICATION OF FUNDS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATIONS. BECAUSE NON-RECOURSE FINANCING GENERALLY RESTRICTS THE LENDER\u2019S CLAIM ON THE ASSETS OF THE BORROWER, THE LENDER GENERALLY MAY ONLY PROCEED AGAINST THE ASSET SECURING THE DEBT. THIS MAY PROTECT THE COMPANY\u2019S OTHER ASSETS.  THE COMPANY PLANS TO EVALUATE EACH INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY AND DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE LEVERAGE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS AND ALSO ON A COMPANY-WIDE BASIS. THE COMPANY MAY SEEK TO REFINANCE INDEBTEDNESS, SUCH AS WHEN A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES MAKES IT BENEFICIAL TO PREPAY AN EXISTING MORTGAGE, WHEN AN EXISTING MORTGAGE MATURES OR IF AN ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT BECOMES AVAILABLE AND THE PROCEEDS FROM THE REFINANCING CAN BE USED TO PURCHASE THE INVESTMENT.  THE COMPANY PLANS TO FINANCE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS, BORROWINGS UNDER ITS CREDIT FACILITY, THE ASSUMPTION OF EXISTING MORTGAGE DEBT, THE ISSUANCE OF OP UNITS, AND EQUITY AND DEBT OFFERINGS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY ACQUIRE RETAIL PROPERTIES INDIRECTLY THROUGH JOINT VENTURES WITH THIRD PARTIES AS A MEANS OF INCREASING THE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES.  DISTRIBUTIONS  THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND ROIC INTEND TO MAKE REGULAR QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS TO HOLDERS OF THEIR OP UNITS AND COMMON STOCK, RESPECTIVELY.  THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP PAYS DISTRIBUTIONS TO ROIC DIRECTLY AS A HOLDER OF UNITS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, AND INDIRECTLY TO ROIC THROUGH DISTRIBUTIONS TO RETAIL OPPORTUNITY INVESTMENTS GP, LLC, A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF ROIC.  U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAW GENERALLY REQUIRES THAT A REIT DISTRIBUTE ANNUALLY AT LEAST 90% OF ITS REIT TAXABLE INCOME, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DEDUCTION FOR DIVIDENDS PAID AND EXCLUDING NET CAPITAL GAINS, AND THAT IT PAY U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX AT REGULAR CORPORATE RATES TO THE EXTENT THAT IT ANNUALLY DISTRIBUTES LESS THAN 100% OF ITS NET TAXABLE INCOME.  ROIC INTENDS TO PAY REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS IN AN AMOUNT NOT LESS THAN ITS NET TAXABLE INCOME, IF AND TO THE EXTENT AUTHORIZED BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  IF ROIC\u2019S CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION IS LESS THAN ITS NET TAXABLE INCOME, ROIC COULD BE REQUIRED TO SELL ASSETS OR BORROW FUNDS TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS OR ROIC MAY MAKE A PORTION OF THE REQUIRED DISTRIBUTION IN THE FORM OF A TAXABLE STOCK DISTRIBUTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF DEBT SECURITIES.

THIS SECTION PROVIDES AN ANALYSIS OF OUR CASH FLOWS AND A DISCUSSION OF OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019.  OVERVIEW  COMPANY BACKGROUND  WE ARE A LEADING GLOBAL PROVIDER OF FINANCIAL SERVICES TECHNOLOGY. WE PROVIDE ACCOUNT PROCESSING SYSTEMS, ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS PROCESSING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INTERNET AND MOBILE BANKING SYSTEMS, AND RELATED SERVICES. WE SERVE OVER 12,000 CLIENTS WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING BANKS, CREDIT UNIONS, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRMS, LEASING AND FINANCE COMPANIES, BILLERS, RETAILERS, AND MERCHANTS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM RECURRING ACCOUNT- AND TRANSACTION-BASED FEES UNDER CONTRACTS THAT GENERALLY HAVE TERMS OF THREE TO FIVE YEARS AND HIGH RENEWAL RATES. MOST OF THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE ARE NECESSARY FOR OUR CLIENTS TO OPERATE THEIR BUSINESSES AND ARE, THEREFORE, NON-DISCRETIONARY IN NATURE.  OUR OPERATIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND ARE COMPRISED OF THE PAYMENTS AND INDUSTRY PRODUCTS (\u201cPAYMENTS\u201d) SEGMENT AND THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SERVICES (\u201cFINANCIAL\u201d) SEGMENT. THE PAYMENTS SEGMENT PRIMARILY PROVIDES ELECTRONIC BILL PAYMENT AND PRESENTMENT SERVICES, INTERNET AND MOBILE BANKING SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, ACCOUNT-TO-ACCOUNT TRANSFERS, PERSON-TO-PERSON PAYMENT SERVICES, DEBIT AND CREDIT CARD PROCESSING AND SERVICES, PAYMENTS INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES, AND OTHER ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS SOFTWARE AND SERVICES. OUR BUSINESSES IN THIS SEGMENT ALSO PROVIDE CARD AND PRINT PERSONALIZATION SERVICES, INVESTMENT ACCOUNT PROCESSING SERVICES FOR SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS, AND FRAUD AND RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE FINANCIAL SEGMENT PROVIDES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH ACCOUNT PROCESSING SERVICES, ITEM PROCESSING AND SOURCE CAPTURE SERVICES, LOAN ORIGINATION AND SERVICING PRODUCTS, CASH MANAGEMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES, AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT SUPPORT NUMEROUS TYPES OF FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. CORPORATE AND OTHER PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF INTERCOMPANY ELIMINATIONS, AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, UNALLOCATED CORPORATE EXPENSES AND OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED WHEN MANAGEMENT EVALUATES SEGMENT PERFORMANCE, SUCH AS GAINS ON SALES OF BUSINESSES AND ASSOCIATED TRANSITION SERVICES.  ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS  WE FREQUENTLY REVIEW OUR PORTFOLIO TO ENSURE WE HAVE THE RIGHT SET OF BUSINESSES TO EXECUTE ON OUR STRATEGY. WE EXPECT TO ACQUIRE BUSINESSES WHEN WE IDENTIFY: A COMPELLING STRATEGIC NEED, SUCH AS A PRODUCT, SERVICE OR TECHNOLOGY THAT HELPS MEET CLIENT DEMAND; AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE INDUSTRY DYNAMICS; A WAY TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS SCALE; OR SIMILAR CONSIDERATIONS. WE EXPECT TO DIVEST BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT IN LINE WITH OUR MARKET, PRODUCT OR FINANCIAL STRATEGIES.  ON OCTOBER 31, 2018, WE ACQUIRED THE DEBIT CARD PROCESSING, ATM MANAGED SERVICES, AND MONEY PASS  \u00ae  SURCHARGE-FREE NETWORK OF ELAN FINANCIAL SERVICES, A UNIT OF U.S. BANCORP, FOR APPROXIMATELY  $659 MILLION  , INCLUDING POST-CLOSING WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS, ESTIMATED CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO EARN-OUT PROVISIONS AND FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER A TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT IN EXCESS OF ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. THIS ACQUISITION, INCLUDED WITHIN THE PAYMENTS SEGMENT, DEEPENS OUR PRESENCE IN DEBIT CARD PROCESSING, BROADENS OUR CLIENT REACH AND SCALE, AND PROVIDES NEW SOLUTIONS TO ENHANCE THE VALUE PROPOSITION FOR OUR EXISTING DEBIT SOLUTION CLIENTS.  ON JANUARY 16, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE MERGER AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE FIRST DATA CORPORATION (\u201cFIRST DATA\u201d) IN AN ALL-STOCK TRANSACTION FOR AN EQUITY VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY  $22 BILLION  AS OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT. FISERV AND FIRST DATA HAVE RECEIVED THE FINAL REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS AND NON-OBJECTIONS NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION. SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OR WAIVER OF THE REMAINING CUSTOMARY CONTRACTUAL CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES EXPECT TO CLOSE THE TRANSACTION ON OR ABOUT JULY 29, 2019. FIRST DATA IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN COMMERCE-ENABLING TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS FOR MERCHANTS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND CARD ISSUERS.  IN MARCH 2018, WE SOLD A 55% INTEREST OF OUR LENDING SOLUTIONS BUSINESS, WHICH WAS REPORTED WITHIN THE FINANCIAL SEGMENT, RETAINING 45% OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN TWO JOINT VENTURES (THE \u201cLENDING JOINT VENTURES\u201d). IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS TRANSACTION, WE ENTERED INTO TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE, AT FAIR VALUE, VARIOUS ADMINISTRATION, BUSINESS PROCESS OUTSOURCING, TECHNICAL AND DATA CENTER RELATED SERVICES FOR DEFINED PERIODS TO THE LENDING JOINT VENTURES. WE RECEIVED GROSS SALE PROCEEDS OF  $419 MILLION  FROM THE TRANSACTIONS.  ENTERPRISE PRIORITIES  WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT A SERIES OF STRATEGIC INITIATIVES TO MOVE MONEY AND INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT MOVES THE WORLD. THESE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES INCLUDE ACTIVE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT OF OUR BUSINESSES, ENHANCING THE OVERALL VALUE OF OUR EXISTING CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS, IMPROVING OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS, BEING DISCIPLINED IN OUR ALLOCATION OF CAPITAL, AND DIFFERENTIATING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH INNOVATION. OUR KEY ENTERPRISE PRIORITIES FOR  2019  ARE TO: (I) CONTINUE TO BUILD HIGH-QUALITY REVENUE WHILE MEETING OUR EARNINGS GOALS; (II) ENHANCE CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON DIGITAL AND PAYMENT SOLUTIONS;  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AND (III) DELIVER INNOVATION AND INTEGRATION WHICH ENABLES DIFFERENTIATED VALUE FOR OUR CLIENTS. WE ALSO EXPECT TO DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO COMPLETING THE FIRST DATA MERGER AND, SUBJECT TO CLOSING, TO INTEGRATING FIRST DATA INTO OUR OPERATIONS.  INDUSTRY TRENDS  THE MARKET FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CONTINUES TO EVOLVE RAPIDLY. THE TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL INDUSTRY AND OTHER MARKET ENTRANTS REGULARLY INTRODUCE AND IMPLEMENT NEW PAYMENT, DEPOSIT, RISK MANAGEMENT, LENDING, AND INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, AND THE DISTINCTIONS AMONG THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TRADITIONALLY OFFERED BY DIFFERENT TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CONTINUE TO NARROW AS THEY SEEK TO SERVE THE SAME CUSTOMERS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE EVOLVING REGULATORY AND CYBERSECURITY LANDSCAPE HAS CONTINUED TO CREATE A CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENT FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, LEGISLATION SUCH AS THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT HAS GENERATED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO GENERATE, NEW REGULATIONS IMPACTING THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY. THESE CONDITIONS ARE DRIVING HEIGHTENED INTEREST IN SOLUTIONS THAT HELP FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WIN AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS, GENERATE INCREMENTAL REVENUE, COMPLY WITH REGULATIONS AND ENHANCE OPERATING EFFICIENCY. EXAMPLES OF THESE SOLUTIONS INCLUDE ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS AND DELIVERY METHODS SUCH AS INTERNET, MOBILE AND TABLET BANKING, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS \u201cDIGITAL CHANNELS.\u201d  THE FOCUS ON DIGITAL CHANNELS BY BOTH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS THE GROWING VOLUME AND TYPES OF PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS IN THE MARKETPLACE, CONTINUES TO ELEVATE THE DATA AND TRANSACTION PROCESSING NEEDS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WE EXPECT THAT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES TO PROCESS TRANSACTIONS, MANAGE INFORMATION, MAINTAIN REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND OFFER INNOVATIVE NEW SERVICES TO THEIR CUSTOMERS IN THIS RAPIDLY EVOLVING AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL BENEFIT OVER THE LONG TERM FROM THE TREND OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MOVING FROM IN-HOUSE TECHNOLOGY TO OUTSOURCED SOLUTIONS AS THEY SEEK TO REMAIN CURRENT ON TECHNOLOGY CHANGES IN AN EVOLVING MARKETPLACE. WE BELIEVE THAT ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING THE INFRASTRUCTURE, TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND NETWORKS NECESSARY TO BE COMPETITIVE IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT ARE ESSENTIAL TO JUSTIFY THESE INVESTMENTS, AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS THAT FACILITATE CUSTOMER INTERACTION WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS THROUGH DIGITAL CHANNELS, WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE, WHICH WE EXPECT TO CREATE REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US.  IN ADDITION TO THE TRENDS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MARKETPLACE HAS EXPERIENCED CHANGE IN COMPOSITION AS WELL. DURING THE PAST 25 YEARS, THE NUMBER OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS DECLINED AT A RELATIVELY STEADY RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 3% PER YEAR, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF VOLUNTARY MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. RATHER THAN REDUCING THE OVERALL MARKET, THESE CONSOLIDATIONS HAVE TRANSFERRED ACCOUNTS AMONG FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. IF A CLIENT LOSS OCCURS DUE TO MERGER OR ACQUISITION, WE RECEIVE A CONTRACT TERMINATION FEE BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE CLIENT AND HOW EARLY IN THE CONTRACT TERM THE CONTRACT IS TERMINATED. THESE FEES CAN VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. OUR REVENUE IS DIVERSIFIED, AND WE HAVE CLIENTS THAT SPAN THE ENTIRE RANGE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN TERMS OF ASSET SIZE AND BUSINESS MODEL, WITH OUR 50 LARGEST FINANCIAL INSTITUTION CLIENTS REPRESENTING LESS THAN 25% OF OUR ANNUAL REVENUE. OUR FOCUS ON LONG-TERM CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS AND RECURRING, TRANSACTION-ORIENTED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAS ALSO REDUCED THE IMPACT THAT CONSOLIDATION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS HAD ON US. WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTEGRATION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CREATES A COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITION FOR OUR CLIENTS BY PROVIDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, NEW SOURCES OF REVENUE AND OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE THEIR COSTS. FURTHERMORE, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SIZABLE AND DIVERSE CLIENT BASE, COMBINED WITH OUR POSITION AS A LEADING PROVIDER OF NON-DISCRETIONARY, RECURRING REVENUE-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, GIVES US A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH.  CHANGES IN CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES. IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE IDENTIFIED OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES THAT WE USE TO PREPARE OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING FOR RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, AND BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE IN LIGHT OF CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL AMOUNTS AND RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES. THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES FROM THOSE DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS CERTAIN AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, THE RELATIVE PERCENTAGE THAT THOSE AMOUNTS REPRESENT TO REVENUE AND THE CHANGE IN THOSE AMOUNTS FROM YEAR TO YEAR.

REVENUE AT CORPORATE AND OTHER DECREASED  $2 MILLION  DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND INCREASED  $6 MILLION  IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  COMPARED TO 2018 DUE TO TRANSITION SERVICES REVENUE ACTIVITY FROM THE LENDING JOINT VENTURES, WHICH COMMENCED IN LATE MARCH 2018.

INTEREST ON OUR SENIOR NOTES IS PAID SEMI-ANNUALLY. DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL FINANCIAL DEBT COVENANTS.  VARIABLE RATE DEBT  WE MAINTAIN A  $2.0 BILLION  REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF BANKS. OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT A VARIABLE RATE BASED ON LIBOR OR ON A BASE RATE, PLUS A SPECIFIED MARGIN BASED ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING IN EFFECT FROM TIME TO TIME. THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT  JUNE 30, 2019  (SEE DISCUSSION BELOW). THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENT FEES AND NO COMPENSATING BALANCE REQUIREMENTS ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH MATURES IN SEPTEMBER 2023.  ON FEBRUARY 6, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO (I) AMEND THE MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO COVENANT TO PERMIT US TO ELECT TO INCREASE THE PERMITTED MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO FROM THREE AND ONE-HALF TIMES OUR CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, NON-CASH CHARGES AND EXPENSES AND CERTAIN OTHER ADJUSTMENTS (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) TO EITHER FOUR TIMES OR FOUR AND ONE-HALF TIMES OUR EBITDA FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD FOLLOWING CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND (II) PERMIT US TO MAKE DRAWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ON THE CLOSING DATE OF OUR ACQUISITION OF FIRST DATA SUBJECT TO ONLY LIMITED CONDITIONS. ON FEBRUARY 15, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDMENT TO OUR EXISTING REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS AVAILABLE THEREUNDER BY  $1.5 BILLION  AND TO MAKE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO FACILITATE THE OPERATION OF THE COMBINED BUSINESS FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION OF FIRST DATA. THE INCREASED COMMITMENTS AND ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE UPON THE SATISFACTION OR WAIVER OF CONDITIONS THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE CONDITIONS TO FUNDING UNDER THE TERM LOAN FACILITY DESCRIBED BELOW.  FIRST DATA ACQUISITION FINANCING  ON JANUARY 16, 2019, IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEFINITIVE MERGER AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE FIRST DATA, WE ENTERED INTO A BRIDGE FACILITY COMMITMENT LETTER PURSUANT TO WHICH A GROUP OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COMMITTED TO PROVIDE A 364-DAY SENIOR UNSECURED BRIDGE TERM LOAN FACILITY IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $17.0 BILLION  FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFINANCING CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS OF FIRST DATA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ON THE CLOSING DATE OF THE MERGER, MAKING CASH PAYMENTS IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES AS PART OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION, AND PAYING FEES AND EXPENSES RELATED TO THE MERGER, THE REFINANCING AND THE RELATED TRANSACTIONS. THERE ARE NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE BRIDGE TERM LOAN FACILITY AT  JUNE 30, 2019  . THE AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS OF  $17.0 BILLION  UNDER THE BRIDGE FACILITY COMMITMENT LETTER HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITH A CORRESPONDING AMOUNT OF PERMANENT FINANCING THROUGH THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT AND ISSUANCE OF SENIOR NOTES, AS DESCRIBED BELOW, RESULTING IN THE TERMINATION OF THE BRIDGE TERM LOAN FACILITY EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2019.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON FEBRUARY 15, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A NEW TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PURSUANT TO WHICH SUCH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE COMMITTED TO PROVIDE US WITH A SENIOR UNSECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $5.0 BILLION  , CONSISTING OF  $1.5 BILLION  IN COMMITMENTS TO PROVIDE LOANS WITH A THREE-YEAR MATURITY AND  $3.5 BILLION  IN COMMITMENTS TO PROVIDE LOANS WITH A FIVE-YEAR MATURITY.

BORROWINGS UNDER THE TERM LOAN FACILITY WILL BEAR INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES BASED ON LIBOR OR ON A BASE RATE PLUS, IN EACH CASE, A SPECIFIED MARGIN BASED ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING IN EFFECT FROM TIME TO TIME. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO PAY A TICKING FEE THAT ACCRUES ON THE AGGREGATE UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS UNDER THE TERM LOAN FACILITY AT A PER ANNUM RATE BASED UPON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATING IN EFFECT FROM TIME TO TIME. THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS AFFIRMATIVE, NEGATIVE AND FINANCIAL COVENANTS, AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT, THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THOSE SET FORTH IN OUR EXISTING REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AS AMENDED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  ON JUNE 24, 2019, WE COMPLETED AN OFFERING OF  $9.0 BILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR NOTES COMPRISED OF  $2.0 BILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  2.75%  SENIOR NOTES DUE IN JULY 2024,  $2.0 BILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  3.2%  SENIOR NOTES DUE IN JULY 2026,  $3.0 BILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  3.5%  SENIOR NOTES DUE IN JULY 2029 AND  $2.0 BILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  4.4%  SENIOR NOTES DUE IN JULY 2049.

IF THE PROPOSED MERGER BETWEEN US AND FIRST DATA IS TERMINATED, HAS NOT BEEN CONSUMMATED, OR WE USE REASONABLE JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE THAT THE MERGER WILL NOT BE CONSUMMATED, ON OR PRIOR TO APRIL 16, 2020, WE ARE REQUIRED TO REDEEM ALL OUTSTANDING SENIOR NOTES AT A PRICE EQUAL TO 101% OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST. WE INTEND TO USE THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE SENIOR NOTES TO REFINANCE INDEBTEDNESS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER WITH FIRST DATA AND USED A PORTION OF THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING DESCRIBED ABOVE TO REPAY ALL OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS TOTALING  $790 MILLION  UNDER OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PENDING SUCH USE. REMAINING PROCEEDS WERE INVESTED IN A HIGHLY LIQUID INSTITUTIONAL BANK DEPOSIT HELD AT A SINGLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND WERE RECORDED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF JUNE 30, 2019.  IN MARCH 2019, WE ENTERED INTO TREASURY LOCKS, DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, IN THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF  $5 BILLION  TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES IN ANTICIPATION OF THE ISSUANCE OF FIXED RATE DEBT IN CONNECTION WITH THE REFINANCING OF CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS OF FIRST DATA AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FORECASTED ISSUANCE OF THESE SENIOR NOTES, WE ENTERED INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO MINIMIZE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE TO THE EURO AND BRITISH POUND UPON SETTLEMENT OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THESE SENIOR NOTES. AT JUNE 30, 2019, THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THESE DERIVATIVES WAS  \u00a31.05 BILLION  (  $1.34 BILLION  ) AND  \u20ac563 MILLION  (  $641 MILLION  ), WITH A FAIR VALUE TOTALING  $2.0 MILLION  RECORDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "FISERV INC", "CIK": 798354, "Date": "2019-07-26T00:00:00", "Ticker": "FISV", "Name": "Fiserv Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 7374.0, "Business": "WI", "Incorporated": "WI", "IRS": 391506125.0, "key": "20190726FISV", "labelr1": 2.2873900293255165, "labelr2": -0.6976299694189639, "labelr3": 1.4628043499182084, "labelr4": -0.7303424072844638, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.57223034, "prof1": 0.42776963, "return1&2": 0.9839428242173136, "return1&2&3": 0.9695496657839546, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9766306981528596, "return2": 1.0069762996941896, "return1": 0.9771260997067448, "return3": 0.985371956500818, "return4": 1.007303424072845, "1_day_return": 2.28739002932552, "cumulative_return1": 6.594375335099557, "cumulative_return1&2": 4.810124628029269, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 8.54353055099197, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 46.846771455776214, "indexx": 1435, "returnpred": -2.2873900293255165, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0061695689967227, "cumreturn1b": 1.3154717050515479, "cumreturn1c": 1.0266613492399534, "cumreturndow": 1.0191071478241773, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0188610928103736}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1462, "level_0": 1499, "index": 33577, "text": "ITEM 2  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GENERAL COMMENTS  OVERVIEW  WE PROVIDE THE BASIC MATERIALS FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND THE U.S. ECONOMY. WE OPERATE PRIMARILY IN THE U.S. AND ARE THE NATION'S LARGEST SUPPLIER OF CONSTRUCTION AGGREGATES (PRIMARILY CRUSHED STONE, SAND AND GRAVEL) AND A MAJOR PRODUCER OF ASPHALT MIX AND READY-MIXED CONCRETE. OUR STRATEGY AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE ARE BASED ON OUR STRENGTH IN AGGREGATES. AGGREGATES ARE USED IN MOST TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION AND IN THE PRODUCTION OF ASPHALT MIX AND READY-MIXED CONCRETE.  DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS DEPENDENT ON CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY AND CORRELATES POSITIVELY WITH GROWTH IN POPULATION, HOUSEHOLD FORMATION AND EMPLOYMENT. END USES INCLUDE PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION (E.G., HIGHWAYS, BRIDGES, BUILDINGS, AIRPORTS, SCHOOLS, PRISONS, SEWER AND WASTE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS, WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS, DAMS AND RESERVOIRS), PRIVATE NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION (E.G., MANUFACTURING, RETAIL, OFFICES, INDUSTRIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL) AND PRIVATE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION (E.G., SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES, DUPLEXES, APARTMENT BUILDINGS AND CONDOMINIUMS). CUSTOMERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE HEAVY CONSTRUCTION AND PAVING CONTRACTORS; COMMERCIAL BUILDING CONTRACTORS; CONCRETE PRODUCTS MANUFACTURERS; RESIDENTIAL BUILDING CONTRACTORS; RAILROADS AND ELECTRIC UTILITIES; AND TO A SMALLER EXTENT STATE, COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS.  AGGREGATES HAVE A HIGH WEIGHT-TO-VALUE RATIO AND, IN MOST CASES, MUST BE PRODUCED NEAR WHERE THEY ARE USED; IF NOT, TRANSPORTATION CAN COST MORE THAN THE MATERIALS, RENDERING THEM UNCOMPETITIVE COMPARED TO LOCALLY PRODUCED MATERIALS. EXCEPTIONS TO THIS TYPICAL MARKET STRUCTURE INCLUDE AREAS ALONG THE U.S. GULF COAST AND THE EASTERN SEABOARD WHERE THERE ARE LIMITED SUPPLIES OF LOCALLY AVAILABLE HIGH-QUALITY AGGREGATES. WE SERVE THESE MARKETS FROM QUARRIES THAT HAVE ACCESS TO COST-EFFECTIVE LONG-HAUL TRANSPORTATION \u2014 SHIPPING BY BARGE AND RAIL \u2014 AND FROM OUR QUARRY ON MEXICO'S YUCATAN PENINSULA WITH OUR FLEET OF PANAMAX-CLASS, SELF-UNLOADING SHIPS.  THERE ARE LIMITED SUBSTITUTES FOR QUALITY AGGREGATES. BECAUSE OF BARRIERS TO ENTRY CREATED IN MANY METROPOLITAN MARKETS BY ZONING AND PERMITTING REGULATION AND BECAUSE OF HIGH TRANSPORTATION COSTS RELATIVE TO THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCT, THE LOCATION OF RESERVES IS A CRITICAL FACTOR TO OUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS.  NO MATERIAL PART OF OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS UPON ANY SINGLE CUSTOMER WHOSE LOSS WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. IN 2018, OUR FIVE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 8% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES (EXCLUDING INTERNAL SALES), AND NO SINGLE CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 2%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES. ALTHOUGH APPROXIMATELY 45% TO 55% OF OUR AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN USED IN PUBLICLY FUNDED CONSTRUCTION, SUCH AS HIGHWAYS, AIRPORTS AND GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS, RELATIVELY INSIGNIFICANT SALES ARE MADE DIRECTLY TO FEDERAL, STATE, COUNTY OR MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS/AGENCIES. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH REDUCTIONS IN STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING CAN CURTAIL PUBLICLY FUNDED CONSTRUCTION, OUR BUSINESS IS NOT DIRECTLY SUBJECT TO RENEGOTIATION OF PROFITS OR TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS WITH STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS.  WHILE AGGREGATES IS OUR FOCUS AND PRIMARY BUSINESS, WE BELIEVE VERTICAL INTEGRATION BETWEEN AGGREGATES AND DOWNSTREAM PRODUCTS, SUCH AS ASPHALT MIX AND READY-MIXED CONCRETE, CAN BE MANAGED EFFECTIVELY IN CERTAIN MARKETS GENERATING ACCEPTABLE FINANCIAL RETURNS AND ENHANCING FINANCIAL RETURNS IN OUR CORE AGGREGATES SEGMENT. WE PRODUCE AND SELL ASPHALT MIX AND/OR READY-MIXED CONCRETE PRIMARILY IN OUR ALABAMA, MID-ATLANTIC, SOUTHWESTERN, TENNESSEE AND WESTERN MARKETS. AGGREGATES COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY 95% OF ASPHALT MIX BY WEIGHT AND 80% OF READY-MIXED CONCRETE BY WEIGHT. IN BOTH OF THESE DOWNSTREAM BUSINESSES, AGGREGATES ARE PRIMARILY SUPPLIED FROM OUR OPERATIONS.  SEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS  ALMOST ALL OUR PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED AND CONSUMED OUTDOORS. SEASONAL CHANGES AND OTHER WEATHER-RELATED CONDITIONS CAN AFFECT THE PRODUCTION AND SALES VOLUME OF OUR PRODUCTS. THEREFORE, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR ANY QUARTER DO NOT NECESSARILY INDICATE THE RESULTS EXPECTED FOR THE YEAR. NORMALLY, THE HIGHEST SALES AND EARNINGS ARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND THE LOWEST ARE IN THE FIRST QUARTER. FURTHERMORE, OUR SALES AND EARNINGS ARE SENSITIVE TO NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, DEMOGRAPHIC AND POPULATION FLUCTUATIONS, AND PARTICULARLY TO CYCLICAL SWINGS IN CONSTRUCTION SPENDING, PRIMARILY IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.  \u200e  27  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR SECOND QUARTER 2019  COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER 2018.  \u200e  \uf0a7  TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED $127.5 MILLION, OR 11%, TO $1,327.7 MILLION  \uf0a7  GROSS PROFIT INCREASED $47.3 MILLION, OR 15%, TO $370.5 MILLION  \uf0a7  AGGREGATES SEGMENT SALES INCREASED $105.8 MILLION, OR 11%, TO $1,062.1 MILLION  \uf0a7  AGGREGATES SEGMENT FREIGHT-ADJUSTED REVENUES INCREASED $75.9 MILLION, OR 10%, TO $806.4 MILLION  \uf0a7  SHIPMENTS INCREASED 4%, OR 2.4 MILLION TONS, TO 57.3 MILLION TONS  \uf0a7  SAME-STORE SHIPMENTS INCREASED 3%, OR 1.7 MILLION TONS, TO 56.7 MILLION TONS  \uf0a7  FREIGHT-ADJUSTED SALES PRICE INCREASED 5.9%, OR $0.78 PER TON  \uf0a7  SAME-STORE FREIGHT-ADJUSTED SALES PRICE INCREASED 5.7%, OR $0.76 PER TON  \uf0a7  SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT INCREASED $45.7 MILLION, OR 16%, TO $329.2 MILLION  \uf0a7  ASPHALT, CONCRETE AND CALCIUM SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT INCREASED $1.6 MILLION, OR 4%, TO $41.3 MILLION, COLLECTIVELY  \uf0a7  SELLING, ADMINISTRATIVE AND GENERAL (SAG) EXPENSES INCREASED $6.6 MILLION AND DECREASED 0.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS (200 BASIS POINTS) AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES  \uf0a7  OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED $45.8 MILLION, OR 20%, TO $276.1 MILLION  \uf0a7  EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $197.9 MILLION, OR $1.48 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO $160.3 MILLION, OR $1.20 PER DILUTED SHARE  \uf0a7  ADJUSTED EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $1.48 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO $1.23 PER DILUTED SHARE  \uf0a7  NET EARNINGS WERE $197.6 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $37.9 MILLION, OR 24%  \uf0a7  ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS $372.0 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $47.2 MILLION, OR 15%  \uf0a7  RETURNED CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS VIA DIVIDENDS ($41.0 MILLION @ $0.31 PER SHARE VERSUS $37.0 MILLION @ $0.28 PER SHARE) AND SHARE REPURCHASES (NONE IN 2019 VERSUS $19.4 MILLION @ AN AVERAGE OF $113.29 PER SHARE)  NET EARNINGS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WERE $197.6 MILLION, UP 24%, AND ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS $372.0 MILLION, UP 15%, COMPARED TO LAST YEAR\u2019S SECOND QUARTER. THE DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A 16% INCREASE IN AGGREGATES SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT. FOR THE QUARTER, AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS INCREASED 4% YEAR-OVER-YEAR, AND FREIGHT-ADJUSTED AGGREGATES PRICING INCREASED 5.9% (5.4% MIX-ADJUSTED). SAME-STORE AGGREGATES GROSS PROFIT INCREMENTAL FLOW-THROUGH RATE FOR THE TRAILING-TWELVE MONTHS WAS 65%.  WE CONTINUED TO EXECUTE WELL. OUR INDUSTRY-LEADING UNIT PROFITABILITY IN AGGREGATES INCREASED FROM $5.16 TO $5.74 PER TON, AN 11% INCREASE COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S SECOND QUARTER. WE REMAIN KEENLY FOCUSED ON CREATING LONG-TERM VALUE BY COMPOUNDING OUR AGGREGATES UNIT MARGINS, WHILE CONTINUING TO OPERATE SAFELY. SHIPMENT GROWTH IN THE SECOND QUARTER WAS SOLID AND CONSISTENT WITH FULL-YEAR EXPECTATIONS. IMPORTANTLY, PRICE IMPROVEMENTS WERE WIDESPREAD. THESE RESULTS FURTHER HIGHLIGHT THE STRENGTH OF OUR AGGREGATES-FOCUSED BUSINESS, WHICH SERVES OUR ATTRACTIVE, LONG-TERM GROWTH MARKETS.  OUR KEY MARKETS ARE BENEFITTING FROM ROBUST GROWTH IN PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION DEMAND, DRIVEN BY HIGHWAYS. STATE-LEVEL TRANSPORTATION FUNDING INCREASES SIGNED INTO LAW IN RECENT YEARS HAVE LED TO NEW HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION STARTS THAT ARE 21% HIGHER THAN TWO YEARS AGO. THIS SIGNIFICANT INCREASE WILL SUPPORT CONTINUED SHIPMENT GROWTH INTO TRANSPORTATION-RELATED END MARKETS IN THE COMING YEARS. SHIPMENTS INTO PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION CONTINUE TO GROW AS WELL. AGGREGATES PRICING MOMENTUM CONTINUES TO IMPROVE,  CONSISTENT WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS. THE CONTINUING IMPROVEMENT IN UNIT PROFITABILITY IS A DIRECT RESULT OF OUR FOCUS ON OPERATING DISCIPLINES AND COMPOUNDING PRICING IMPROVEMENTS.  C  APITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE SECOND QUARTER WERE $103.8 MILLION. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDED $63.8 MILLION OF CORE OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE CAPITAL TO IMPROVE OR REPLACE EXISTING PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT. IN ADDITION, WE INVESTED $40.0 MILLION IN INTERNAL GROWTH PROJECTS TO SECURE NEW AGGREGATES RESERVES, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTION SITES, ENHANCE OUR DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES AND SUPPORT THE TARGETED GROWTH OF OUR ASPHALT OPERATIONS. THROUGH THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALED $225.8 MILLION ($131.2 MILLION MAINTENANCE CAPITAL AND $94.6 MILLION INTERNAL GROWTH CAPITAL). OUR FULL-YEAR EXPECTATIONS FOR 2019 REMAIN UNCHANGED AT $250 MILLION ON MAINTENANCE CAPITAL AND $200 MILLION ON INTERNAL GROWTH PROJECTS.  28  DURING THE QUARTER, WE RETURNED $41.0 MILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS, AN 11% INCREASE VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. NO SHARES WERE REPURCHASED DURING THE QUARTER. AT QUARTER-END, TOTAL DEBT WAS $2.9 BILLION, OR 2.4 TIMES TRAILING-TWELVE MONTH ADJUSTED EBITDA.  OVERALL DEMAND GROWTH IN OUR MARKETS REMAIN HEALTHY. PUBLIC DEMAND GROWTH, LED BY HIGHWAYS, CONTINUES TO BE ROBUST ACROSS OUR FOOTPRINT. SHIPMENTS INTO PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION END MARKETS CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THE ONGOING ECONOMIC RECOVERY. DEMAND FUNDAMENTALS, INCLUDING POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT GROWTH, UNDERPIN LONG-TERM GROWTH IN RESIDENTIAL AND PRIVATE NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. WE DELIVERED GOOD INCREMENTAL EARNINGS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR. UNIT PROFITABILITY IN AGGREGATES INCREASED 11% THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF 2019, AND WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO CARRY THAT MOMENTUM FORWARD THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. FOR THE FULL YEAR, WE EXPECT EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF BETWEEN $4.55 AND $5.05 PER DILUTED SHARE AND ADJUSTED EBITDA OF BETWEEN $1.250 BILLION AND $1.330 BILLION.  29  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  TOTAL REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM OUR PRODUCT SALES OF AGGREGATES, ASPHALT MIX AND READY-MIXED CONCRETE, AND INCLUDE FREIGHT & DELIVERY COSTS THAT WE PASS ALONG TO OUR CUSTOMERS TO DELIVER THESE PRODUCTS. WE ALSO GENERATE SERVICE REVENUES FROM OUR ASPHALT CONSTRUCTION PAVING BUSINESS AND SERVICES RELATED TO OUR AGGREGATES BUSINESS.

SHIPMENTS INCREASED IN AGGREGATES (+4%) AND ASPHALT MIX (+8%) WHILE THEY DECLINED IN READY-MIXED CONCRETE (-7%). GROSS PROFIT INCREASED IN THE AGGREGATES (+$45.7 MILLION OR +16%) AND ASPHALT (+$1.8 MILLION OR +7%) SEGMENTS, WHILE IT DECLINED IN THE CONCRETE SEGMENT (-$0.3 MILLION OR -2%). A 1% DECREASE IN THE UNIT COST OF DIESEL FUEL LOWERED COSTS BY $0.4 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S SECOND QUARTER WITH MOST OF THIS COST DECLINE REFLECTED IN THE AGGREGATES SEGMENT.  NET EARNINGS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WERE $197.6 MILLION, OR $1.48 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO $159.7 MILLION, OR $1.19 PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018. EACH PERIOD\u2019S RESULTS WERE IMPACTED BY DISCRETE ITEMS, AS FOLLOWS.  NET EARNINGS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019  INCLUDE.  \uf0a7  NO DISCRETE ITEMS  NET EARNINGS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 INCLUDE.  \uf0a7  PRETAX CHARGES OF $4.5 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH NON-ROUTINE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT  \uf0a7  PRETAX CHARGES OF $1.1 MILLION FOR MANAGERIAL RESTRUCTURING  ADJUSTED FOR THESE DISCRETE ITEMS, EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS (ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS) WAS $1.48 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO $1.23 PER DILUTED SHARE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  CONTINUING OPERATIONS  \u2014 CHANGES IN EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 VERSUS THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW.

UNIT MARGINS INCREASED $0.58 PER TON, OR 11%, TO $5.74 PER TON. THIS IMPROVEMENT RESULTED FROM SOLID GROWTH IN SHIPMENTS, PRICE IMPROVEMENTS AND EXECUTION OF OPERATING DISCIPLINES AND EFFICIENCIES.  SECOND QUARTER AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS INCREASED 4% (3% ON A SAME-STORE BASIS) VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE SOLID UNDERLYING DEMAND FUNDAMENTALS OF INCREASED PUBLIC FUNDING FOR HIGHWAYS, ALONG WITH EMPLOYMENT AND POPULATION GROWTH, HELPED DRIVE SHIPMENT STRENGTH ACROSS MOST OF OUR FOOTPRINT, PARTICULARLY IN THE MID-ATLANTIC AND SOUTHEAST. WET WEATHER DELAYED SHIPMENTS ACROSS ILLINOIS, TENNESSEE AND TEXAS. CALIFORNIA OVERCAME ANOTHER QUARTER OF WET WEATHER TO REALIZE SHIPMENT GROWTH COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. A HEALTHY DEMAND ENVIRONMENT, LED BY TRANSPORTATION-RELATED CONSTRUCTION, IS DRIVING VOLUME GROWTH AND PRICE IMPROVEMENT.  ALL OF OUR KEY MARKETS REPORTED YEAR-OVER-YEAR PRICE GROWTH. FOR THE QUARTER, FREIGHT-ADJUSTED AVERAGE SALES PRICE FOR AGGREGATES INCREASED 5.9% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER. FAVORABLE MIX ADDED 0.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS (50 BASIS POINTS) TO OVERALL GROWTH. POSITIVE TRENDS IN BACKLOGGED PROJECT WORK ALONG WITH DEMAND VISIBILITY AND CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE, SUPPORT SIMILAR PRICE IMPROVEMENT THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  31  SECOND QUARTER SAME-STORE UNIT COST OF SALES (FREIGHT-ADJUSTED) INCREASED LESS THAN 2% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  TRAILING-TWELVE MONTH SAME-STORE INCREMENTAL GROSS PROFIT FLOW-THROUGH RATE WAS 65%, WHICH IS SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF LONGER-TERM EXPECTATIONS OF 60%. QUARTERLY GROSS PROFIT FLOW-THROUGH RATES CAN VARY WIDELY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER; THEREFORE, WE EVALUATE THIS METRIC ON A TRAILING-TWELVE MONTH BASIS. WE  REMAIN FOCUSED ON COMPOUNDING IMPROVEMENTS IN UNIT MARGINS THROUGHOUT THE CYCLE THROUGH FIXED COST LEVERAGE, PRICE GROWTH AND OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.  ASPHALT SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT WAS $27.6 MILLION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER, AN INCREASE OF $1.8 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. ASPHALT SHIPMENTS INCREASED 8% (5% SAME-STORE), AND ASPHALT MIX SELLING PRICES INCREASED 8%, OR $4.34 PER TON, IN THE SECOND QUARTER. THE AVERAGE UNIT COST FOR LIQUID ASPHALT WAS 16% HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. LIQUID ASPHALT COSTS HAVE REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR AND HAVE ALLOWED PRICING GAINS TO BEGIN OFFSETTING THE HIGHER UNIT COSTS FOR LIQUID ASPHALT.  CONCRETE SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT WAS $12.9 MILLION, A 2% DECREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. SHIPMENTS WERE 0.8 MILLION CUBIC YARDS, DOWN FROM 0.9 MILLION CUBIC YARDS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. AVERAGE SALES PRICE INCREASED 5% AND LED TO MODEST GAINS IN MATERIAL MARGINS.  CALCIUM SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT WAS $0.8 MILLION, A SLIGHT INCREASE VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  SAG EXPENSES WERE $95.7 MILLION VERSUS $89.0 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S SECOND QUARTER.  THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE WAS DUE MAINLY TO COMPENSATION RELATED EXPENSE, INCLUDING INCENTIVES THAT ARE TIED TO EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS AND THE SHARE PRICE. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE MADE INVESTMENTS IN PEOPLE AND PROCESSES TO ACCELERATE THE BENEFITS DERIVED FROM OUR SALES AND OPERATIONAL INITIATIVES. ON A TRAILING-TWELVE MONTH BASIS, SAG EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES WAS 7.6%, 0.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS (30 BASIS POINTS) LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON FURTHER LEVERAGING OUR OVERHEAD COST STRUCTURE.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WAS $47.6 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO AN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $40.0 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  THE INCREASE IN TAX EXPENSE WAS RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXCESS TAX BENEFITS QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER.  EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $1.48 PER DILUTED SHARE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO $1.20 PER DILUTED SHARE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  \u2014 SECOND QUARTER PRETAX LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WAS $0.7 MILLION IN 2019 COMPARED WITH $0.9 MILLION IN 2018. BOTH PERIODS INCLUDE CHARGES RELATED TO GENERAL AND PRODUCT LIABILITY COSTS, INCLUDING LEGAL DEFENSE COSTS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FORMER CHEMICALS BUSINESS. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS, SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER THE CAPTION DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  32  YEAR-TO-DATE JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO YEAR-TO-DATE JUNE 30, 2018  TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 WERE $2,324.2 MILLION, UP 13% FROM THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018. SHIPMENTS WERE UP IN AGGREGATES (+8%) AND ASPHALT MIX (+9%) WHILE DOWN IN READY-MIXED CONCRETE (-12%). GROSS PROFIT INCREASED IN THE AGGREGATES SEGMENT (+$83.2 MILLION OR +19%) WHILE IT DECLINED IN THE ASPHALT (-$1.7 MILLION OR -6%) AND CONCRETE (-$2.1 MILLION OR -9%) SEGMENTS. A 20% INCREASE IN UNIT COSTS FOR LIQUID ASPHALT LOWERED ASPHALT SEGMENT EARNINGS BY $19.7 MILLION. CONVERSELY, A 3% DECREASE IN THE UNIT COST OF DIESEL FUEL LOWERED COSTS $1.6 MILLION FROM THE FIRST HALF OF 2018 WITH MOST ($1.5 MILLION) OF THIS COST DECLINE IN THE AGGREGATES SEGMENT.  NET EARNINGS FOR FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 WERE $260.9 MILLION, OR $1.96 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO $212.6 MILLION, OR $1.58 PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018. EACH PERIOD\u2019S RESULTS WERE IMPACTED BY DISCRETE ITEMS, AS FOLLOWS.

AS A PERCENTAGE OF SEGMENT SALES, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN EXPANDED 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINTS (100 BASIS POINTS) DUE PRIMARILY TO STRONG GROWTH IN SHIPMENTS AND PRICE IMPROVEMENTS. AGGREGATES SEGMENT SALES OF $1,897.0 MILLION WERE UP 15% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S FIRST HALF, AND AGGREGATES FREIGHT-ADJUSTED REVENUES OF $1,435.1 MILLION WERE UP 14%. FIRST-HALF AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS INCREASED 8% (SAME-STORE +7%), OR 7.5 MILLION TONS (SAME-STORE +6.5 MILLION TONS), COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. FREIGHT-ADJUSTED AVERAGE SALES PRICE FOR AGGREGATES INCREASED 5.7%, OR $0.75 PER TON, VERSUS THE FIRST HALF OF 2018. EXCLUDING MIX IMPACT, AGGREGATES PRICE INCREASED 5.4%. FIRST HALF 2019 UNIT COST OF SALES (FREIGHT-ADJUSTED) IN THE AGGREGATES SEGMENT WAS UP 3%, OR $0.27 PER TON, VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR.  33  ASPHALT SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT OF $24.3 MILLION WAS DOWN $1.7 MILLION FROM THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018. ASPHALT MIX SHIPMENTS INCREASED 9% (+7% SAME-STORE) WHILE SELLING PRICES INCREASED 7%, OR $3.76 PER TON. HOWEVER, THE AVERAGE UNIT COST FOR LIQUID ASPHALT WAS 20% HIGHER THAN THE FIRST HALF OF 2018, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING EARNINGS BY $19.7 MILLION.  CONCRETE SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT WAS $21.5 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, A DECREASE OF $2.1 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. READY-MIXED CONCRETE SHIPMENTS DECREASED 12% (SAME-STORE DECREASED 8%) VERSUS THE FIRST HALF OF 2018.  OUR CALCIUM SEGMENT\u2019S GROSS PROFIT OF $1.5 MILLION WAS UP $0.2 MILLION VERSUS THE FIRST HALF OF 2018.  FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, TOTAL GROSS PROFIT IN OUR NON-AGGREGATES SEGMENTS WAS $47.2 MILLION, A 7% DECREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S COMPARABLE PERIOD.  SAG EXPENSES WERE $186.0 MILLION VERSUS $167.4 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S FIRST HALF REFLECTING A 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINT (10 BASIS POINT) DECREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  WE FOLLOW CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHEN PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A SUMMARY OF THESE POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 (FORM 10-K).  WE PREPARE THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO CONFORM WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE PRINCIPLES REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT OUR REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT CONDITIONS AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS WE BELIEVE REASONABLE UNDER EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES AND EVALUATE THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THE RESULTS OF THESE ESTIMATES FORM THE BASIS FOR OUR JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS WELL AS IDENTIFYING AND ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT WITH RESPECT TO COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED IN THE \u201cMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d SECTION OF OUR FORM 10-K REQUIRE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SO WE CONSIDER THESE TO BE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.

THE PURCHASE PRICE IN THE ACQUISITION CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING: (A) APPROXIMATELY $84.4 MILLION IN CASH AT CLOSING, (B) THE ISSUANCE OF 150,094 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK TO AN EQUITYHOLDER OF CID, AND (C) $2.5 MILLION IN CASH AS A RESULT OF THE CASH AND WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT.  BUSINESS OUTLOOK  SUPERIOR IS COMPRISED OF THREE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: (1) UNIFORMS AND RELATED PRODUCTS, (2) REMOTE STAFFING SOLUTIONS, AND (3) PROMOTIONAL PRODUCTS.  UNIFORMS AND RELATED PRODUCTS  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE MANUFACTURED AND SOLD A WIDE RANGE OF UNIFORMS, CAREER APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES, WHICH COMPRISES OUR UNIFORMS AND RELATED PRODUCTS SEGMENT. OUR PRIMARY PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED TO WORKERS EMPLOYED BY OUR CUSTOMERS AND, AS A RESULT, OUR BUSINESS PROSPECTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT AND OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. OUR REVENUES ARE IMPACTED BY OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 OPENING AND CLOSING OF LOCATIONS AND REDUCTIONS AND INCREASES IN HEADCOUNT. ADDITIONALLY, VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE TURNOVER AT OUR CUSTOMERS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN THE UNITED STATES IS CONTINUING TO SEE MODERATE IMPROVEMENT IN THE EMPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT AND VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE TURNOVER HAS BEEN INCREASING.  WE ALSO CONTINUE TO SEE AN INCREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR EMPLOYEES IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR AND OUR ACQUISITION OF CID PROVIDES US WITH A MARKET TO SELL FASHION SEAL HEALTHCARE APPAREL TO RETAIL STORES AND INTO THE DIGITAL MARKETPLACE. THESE FACTORS ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE POSITIVE IMPACTS ON OUR PROSPECTS FOR NET SALES GROWTH IN 2019.  WE HAVE CONTINUED OUR EFFORTS TO INCREASE PENETRATION OF THE HEALTH CARE MARKET. WE HAVE PURSUED, AND CONTINUE TO PURSUE, ACQUISITIONS TO INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE IN THE UNIFORMS AND RELATED PRODUCTS SEGMENT.  REMOTE STAFFING SOLUTIONS  THIS BUSINESS SEGMENT, WHICH OPERATES IN EL SALVADOR, BELIZE, JAMAICA, AND THE UNITED STATES, WAS INITIALLY STARTED TO PROVIDE REMOTE STAFFING SERVICES FOR THE COMPANY AT A LOWER COST STRUCTURE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE OUR OWN OPERATING RESULTS.   IT HAS IN FACT ENABLED US TO REDUCE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR UNIFORMS AND RELATED PRODUCTS SEGMENT AND TO MORE EFFECTIVELY SERVICE OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 NEEDS IN THAT SEGMENT.  WE BEGAN SELLING REMOTE STAFFING SERVICES TO OTHER COMPANIES AT THE END OF 2009. WE HAVE GROWN THIS BUSINESS FROM APPROXIMATELY $1.0 MILLION IN NET SALES TO OUTSIDE CUSTOMERS IN 2010 TO APPROXIMATELY $27.3 MILLION IN NET SALES TO OUTSIDE CUSTOMERS IN 2018.  WE HAVE SPENT SIGNIFICANT EFFORT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IMPROVING THE DEPTH OF OUR MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPANDING OUR FACILITIES IN THIS SEGMENT TO SUPPORT SIGNIFICANT GROWTH. NET SALES TO OUTSIDE CUSTOMERS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 15% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  PROMOTIONAL PRODUCTS  WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE SALE OF PROMOTIONAL PRODUCTS, ON A LIMITED BASIS, TO OUR UNIFORMS AND RELATED PRODUCTS CUSTOMERS FOR OVER A DECADE. HOWEVER, WE LACKED THE SCALE AND EXPERTISE NEEDED TO BE A RECOGNIZED NAME IN THIS MARKET PRIOR TO OUR ACQUISITION OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF BAMKO EFFECTIVE ON MARCH 1, 2016. BAMKO HAS BEEN OPERATING IN THE PROMOTIONAL PRODUCTS INDUSTRY FOR MORE THAN 16 YEARS AND WE BELIEVE THAT BAMKO\u2019S STRONG BACK OFFICE AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS LOCATED IN INDIA, CHINA AND HONG KONG, AS WELL AS THEIR \u201cDIRECT TO FACTORY\u201d SOURCING OPERATIONS PROVIDE US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. WE BELIEVE THAT BAMKO HAS WELL DEVELOPED SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES THAT CAN SERVE AS A PLATFORM FOR ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS THAT WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE IN THIS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED MARKET. WE COMPLETED TWO ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS IN THIS SEGMENT IN LATE 2017. WE BELIEVE PROMOTIONAL PRODUCTS ARE A SYNERGISTIC FIT WITH OUR UNIFORM BUSINESS.  21  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  NET SALES  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018% CHANGE  UNIFORMS AND RELATED PRODUCTS  $60,745  $56,403  7.7%  REMOTE STAFFING SOLUTIONS  8,993  8,001  12.4  PROMOTIONAL PRODUCTS  23,744  19,014  24.9  NET INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATIONS  (1,212  )  (1,026  )  18.1  CONSOLIDATED NET SALES  $92,270  $82,392  12.0%  NET SALES FOR THE COMPANY INCREASED 12.0% FROM $82.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 TO $92.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.

SHIPMENTS (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)  IN THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, WE USE A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OUR PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION, BUT WHICH IS NOT PRESENTED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d). THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS \u201cSHIPMENTS\u201d, AND REPRESENTS A PRIMARY METRIC BY WHICH OUR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES CUSTOMER DEMAND.  WE DEFINE SHIPMENTS AS NET SALES EXCLUDING, IF APPLICABLE, SALES RECORDED WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS IN WHICH THERE IS AN ENFORCEABLE RIGHT TO THE PAYMENT FOR GOODS WITH NO ALTERNATIVE USE IN ADVANCE OF THE TRANSFER OF THESE GOODS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. AS RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 606, NET SALES GENERATED FROM SUCH CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AS OF THE TIME AT WHICH WE RECEIVE THE GOODS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS RATHER THAN AT THE TIME WE TRANSFER THEM TO OUR CUSTOMERS. FOR CUSTOMERS TO WHICH WE SELL GOODS THAT HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE USE, OR CUSTOMERS WITH WHOM WE DO NOT HAVE AN ENFORCEABLE RIGHT TO PAYMENT WITH NO ALTERNATIVE USE, SHIPMENTS AND NET SALES ARE IDENTICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES.  WE BELIEVE THAT SALES RECORDED UNDER ASC 606 ARE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S PURCHASING PATTERNS THAT MAY NOT BE DIRECTLY ALIGNED WITH CUSTOMER DEMAND. WE BELIEVE THAT SHIPMENTS, AS A SUPPLEMENTAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE, TRACKS CUSTOMER DEMAND MORE CLOSELY.  SHIPMENTS IS NOT A MEASURE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR SALES DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. SHIPMENTS IS USED AS A MEASUREMENT OF CUSTOMER DEMAND AND WE BELIEVE IT TO BE A HELPFUL MEASURE FOR THOSE EVALUATING PERFORMANCE OF A COMPANY OPERATING IN THE UNIFORM AND PROMOTIONAL PRODUCTS BUSINESSES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO THE USE OF THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE. OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. OTHER COMPANIES, INCLUDING COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY, MAY CALCULATE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO, LIMITING THE USEFULNESS OF THOSE MEASURES FOR COMPARATIVE PURPOSES.  26  RECONCILIATION OF UNIFORM AND RELATED PRODUCTS SEGMENT (WITHOUT CID) GAAP SALES TO SHIPMENTS  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019  2018  2019  2018  UNIFORM AND RELATED PRODUCT NET SALES, AS REPORTED  $60,745  $56,403  $119,424  $104,528  LESS: CID SALES  (15,888  )  (10,587  )  (32,023  )  (10,587  )  UNIFORM AND RELATED PRODUCT NET SALES WITHOUT CID  44,857  45,816  87,401  93,941  ADJUSTMENT: RECOGNITION OF REVENUE BASED ON THE TIMING OF SHIPMENTS FOR FINISHED GOODS WITH NO ALTERNATIVE USE FOR  UNIFORM AND RELATED PRODUCT NET SALES WITHOUT CID  3,573  3,503  5,167  503  UNIFORM AND RELATED PRODUCT SHIPMENTS WITHOUT CID  $48,430  $49,319  $92,568  $94,444  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENGAGE IN ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS.

IN ADDITION, WE CONSIDERED HOW OTHER KEY ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING DISCOUNT RATES AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES, USED IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR\u2019S IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS, COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS AND ECONOMIC EVENTS.  WE CONSIDERED TRENDS IN THESE FACTORS WHEN PERFORMING OUR ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER AN INTERIM IMPAIRMENT REVIEW WAS REQUIRED FOR ANY REPORTING UNIT. BASED ON THIS INTERIM ASSESSMENT, WE CONCLUDED THAT AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, NO EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATED THAT IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE FOR ANY REPORTING UNIT HAD DECLINED BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. NEVERTHELESS, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS COULD RESULT IN CHANGES TO EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS AND KEY VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS. SUCH CHANGES COULD RESULT IN REVISIONS OF OUR ESTIMATES OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS AND COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN A FUTURE INTERIM PERIOD OR AS OF OCT  OBER 31, 2019, OUR NEXT ANNUAL MEASUREMENT DATE.

BORROWINGS UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE DEPENDENT ON THE AVERAGE QUARTERLY AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT AND ARE CALCULATED ACCORDING TO A BASE RATE (EXCEPT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, BASED ON THE PRIME RATE) OR A EUROCURRENCY RATE (EXCEPT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, BASED ON LIBOR) PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN. THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR BASE RATE LOANS RANGES FROM 0.25% TO 0.50% AND THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR EUROCURRENCY LOANS RANGES FROM 1.25% TO 1.50%. IN ADDITION, A FEE IS PAYABLE QUARTERLY ON THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE TO BE BORROWED UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE FEE ACCRUES AT A RATE OF EITHER 0.25% OR 0.375% DEPENDING UPON THE AVERAGE USAGE OF THE FACILITY.  THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2022, AT WHICH TIME ALL OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL BE DUE AND PAYABLE. BORROWINGS UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT MAY BE USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  THERE WERE $270.0 MILLION OF BORROWINGS UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT AS OF JUNE 30, 2019. BASED ON OUR BORROWING BASE AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 AND EXISTING BORROWINGS, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $397.2 MILLION BORROWING CAPACITY AVAILABLE UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT.  37  THE CURRENT AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 IS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW.  JUNE 30, 2019  AVAILABILITY  (IN MILLIONS)  ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT  $800.0  AVAILABILITY REDUCTION DUE TO AVAILABLE BORROWING BASE  99.0  $701.0  USAGE  BORROWINGS UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT  $270.0  OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT  33.8  $303.8  CURRENT AVAILABILITY AT JUNE 30, 2019  $397.2  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  220.5  TOTAL AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY  (A)  $617.7  (A)  TOTAL AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY DOES NOT INCLUDE CREDIT FACILITIES OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH ARE UNCOMMITTED FACILITIES.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE TRANSFERRED APPROXIMATELY $122 MILLION OF CASH HELD IN INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS TO THE U.S. WHICH WAS USED TO REDUCE DEBT OUTSTANDING. BASED ON CURRENT REGULATIONS AND PROCESS REQUIREMENTS, WE EXPECT TO TRANSFER ADDITIONAL CASH HELD IN INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS TO THE U.S. IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2019.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE DEBT COVENANTS UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT  AND EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES OF OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR 2019 AND THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE MET ALL THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO BORROW UNDER THE  ABL  CREDIT AGREEMENT AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MEET THE BORROWING CONDITIONS.  THE FAILURE OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SUPPORTING THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT WOULD REDUCE THE SIZE OF OUR COMMITTED FACILITY UNLESS A REPLACEMENT INSTITUTION WAS ADDED. CURRENTLY, THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT IS SUPPORTED BY EIGHT U.S. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD $156.5 MILLION IN OTHER UNCOMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES, PRIMARILY OUTSIDE THE U.S. (THE \u201cOTHER FACILITIES\u201d). THERE WERE $103.2 MILLION IN OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT, BANK GUARANTEES AND BANK ACCEPTANCE DRAFTS OF WHICH $33.8 MILLION WERE ISSUED, AND REDUCED AVAILABILITY, UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT. TOTAL BORROWINGS UNDER THE ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER FACILITIES (THE \u201cCOMBINED FACILITIES\u201d) WERE $300.5 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2019.  OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE AFFECTED BY OUR CREDIT RATINGS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, MOODY\u2019S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC. (\u201cMOODY\u2019S\u201d) DOWNGRADED OUR LONG-TERM CORPORATE CREDIT RATING FROM B1 TO B2 AND DOWNGRADED THE SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT CREDIT RATING FROM B2 TO B3. THE OUTLOOK REMAINED STABLE. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, S&P GLOBAL RATINGS (\u201cS&P\u201d) AFFIRMED OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING BUT REVISED THE OUTLOOK FROM STABLE TO NEGATIVE AND LOWERED THE CREDIT RATINGS ON THE SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT FROM B TO B-  . OUR S&P AND MOODY\u2019S CREDIT RATINGS AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 ARE SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW.  S&P  MOODY'S  LONG-TERM CORPORATE CREDIT RATING  B, NEG  B2, STABLE  SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT  B-  B3  TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT  B+  B1  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL A PRINTING FACILITY IN SHENZHEN, CHINA AND TRANSFER THE RELATED LAND USE RIGHTS. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, WE RECEIVED NON-REFUNDABLE DEPOSITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $32.1 MILLION, WHICH ARE RECORDED IN OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS WILL BE PAID TO US IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT. BASED ON THE CURRENT EXCHANGE RATE, GROSS PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE, INCLUDING NON-REFUNDABLE DEPOSITS, ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $250.0 MILLION  AND WE EXPECT THE TRANSACTION TO CLOSE IN 2021 AFTER CLOSING CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED AND GOVERNMENT APPROVALS ARE OBTAINED. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE CARRYING COST OF THE BUILDING AND LAND USE RIGHTS IS RECORDED IN OTHER NONCURRENT ASSETS AND IS NOT MATERIAL.  DIVIDENDS  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE PAID CASH DIVIDENDS OF $4.3 MILLION. ON JULY 26, 2019, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.03 PER COMMON SHARE, PAYABLE ON SEPTEMBER 3, 2019 TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD ON AUGUST 15, 2019.  38  MANAGEMENT OF MARKET RISK  WE ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK ON OUR VARIABLE DEBT AND PRICE RISK ON OUR FIXED-RATE DEBT. AT JUNE 30, 2019, OUR VARIABLE-INTEREST BORROWINGS WERE $847.7 MILLION. APPROXIMATELY 60.4% OF OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT WAS COMPRISED OF FIXED-RATE DEBT AS OF JUNE 30, 2019.  WE ASSESS MARKET RISK BASED ON CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES UTILIZING A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS THAT MEASURES THE POTENTIAL LOSS IN EARNINGS, FAIR VALUES AND CASH FLOWS BASED ON A HYPOTHETICAL 10% CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES. USING THIS SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, SUCH CHANGES WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON INTEREST INCOME OR EXPENSE AND CASH FLOWS AND WOULD CHANGE THE FAIR VALUES OF FIXED-RATE DEBT AT JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018 BY APPROXIMATELY $31.6 MILLION AND $35.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BASED ON OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. THE EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS WITHIN MANY COUNTRIES IS LIMITED BECAUSE THE OPERATING REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF OUR VARIOUS SUBSIDIARIES AND BUSINESS UNITS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE LOCAL CURRENCY OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. TO THE EXTENT THAT BORROWINGS, SALES, PURCHASES, REVENUES, EXPENSES OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT IN THE LOCAL CURRENCY OF THE SUBSIDIARY, WE ARE EXPOSED TO CURRENCY RISK AND MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE CURRENCY RISK. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF OUTSTANDING FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $156.9 MILLION AND $170.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY (SEE NOTE 15,  DERIVATIVES  , TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). NET UNREALIZED (LOSSES) GAINS FROM THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS WERE LOSSES OF $1.3 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2019 AND GAINS OF $0.6 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. WE DO NOT USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING OR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.
