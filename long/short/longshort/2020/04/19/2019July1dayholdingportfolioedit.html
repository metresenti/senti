MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  WE OPERATE IN THREE REPORTABLE  SEGMENTS: MANUFACTURING; WHEELS, REPAIR & PARTS; AND LEASING & SERVICES. OUR SEGMENTS ARE OPERATIONALLY INTEGRATED. THE MANUFACTURING SEGMENT, WHICH CURRENTLY OPERATES FROM FACILITIES IN THE U.S., MEXICO, POLAND, ROMANIA AND  TURKEY, PRODUCES DOUBLE-STACK INTERMODAL RAILCARS, TANK CARS, CONVENTIONAL RAILCARS, AUTOMOTIVE RAILCAR PRODUCTS AND MARINE VESSELS. THE WHEELS, REPAIR & PARTS SEGMENT PERFORMS WHEEL AND AXLE SERVICING; RAILCAR REPAIR, REFURBISHMENT AND  MAINTENANCE; AS WELL AS PRODUCTION OF A VARIETY OF PARTS FOR THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY IN NORTH AMERICA. THE LEASING & SERVICES SEGMENT OWNS APPROXIMATELY 8,900 RAILCARS AND PROVIDES MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR APPROXIMATELY 374,000 RAILCARS FOR  RAILROADS, SHIPPERS, CARRIERS, INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND OTHER LEASING AND TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES IN NORTH AMERICA AS OF MAY 31, 2019. THROUGH UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES WE PRODUCE RAILCARS IN BRAZIL, RAIL AND INDUSTRIAL CASTINGS, TANK HEADS  AND OTHER COMPONENTS AND WE HAVE AN OWNERSHIP STAKE IN A LEASE FINANCING WAREHOUSE.  OUR TOTAL MANUFACTURING BACKLOG OF RAILCAR UNITS AS OF MAY 31,  2019 WAS APPROXIMATELY 26,100 UNITS WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF $2.74 BILLION. APPROXIMATELY 1% OF BACKLOG UNITS AND ESTIMATED VALUE AS OF MAY 31, 2019 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BRAZILIAN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS WHICH IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER  THE EQUITY METHOD. BACKLOG UNITS FOR LEASE MAY BE SYNDICATED TO THIRD PARTIES OR HELD IN OUR OWN FLEET DEPENDING ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS. MULTI-YEAR SUPPLY AGREEMENTS ARE A PART OF RAIL INDUSTRY PRACTICE. A PORTION OF THE ORDERS INCLUDED IN BACKLOG  REFLECTS AN ASSUMED PRODUCT MIX. UNDER TERMS OF THE ORDERS, THE EXACT MIX AND PRICING WILL BE DETERMINED IN THE FUTURE, WHICH MAY IMPACT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF BACKLOG. MARINE BACKLOG AS OF MAY 31, 2019 WAS $82 MILLION.  OUR BACKLOG OF RAILCAR UNITS AND MARINE VESSELS IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CERTAIN ORDERS IN BACKLOG ARE SUBJECT TO  CUSTOMARY DOCUMENTATION AND COMPLETION OF TERMS. CUSTOMERS MAY ATTEMPT TO CANCEL OR MODIFY ORDERS IN BACKLOG.

THE $3.6 MILLION INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO $5.8 MILLION IN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE THE MANUFACTURING  BUSINESS OF AMERICAN RAILCAR INDUSTRIES. THE INCREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO A $3.4 MILLION INCREASE FROM THE ADDITION OF THE SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FROM THE REPAIR SHOPS RETURNED TO US AFTER DISCONTINUING THE GBW JOINT VENTURE. THESE  INCREASES IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $5.7 MILLION DECREASE IN EMPLOYEE COSTS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A DECREASE IN INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  NET GAIN ON DISPOSITION OF EQUIPMENT  NET GAIN ON  DISPOSITION OF EQUIPMENT WAS $37.5 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $39.8 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIOD.

THE CHANGE IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE (GAIN) LOSS WAS PRIMARILY  ATTRIBUTED TO OUR OPERATIONS IN EUROPE.  42  THE GREENBRIER COMPANIES, INC.  INCOME TAX  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WAS 28.9% COMPARED TO 13.1% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018. THE CURRENT YEAR  TAX RATE WAS IMPACTED BY A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR WHICH THERE WAS NO TAX BENEFIT. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, THE TAX RATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WAS 25.8%.  THE PRIOR YEAR TAX RATE WAS IMPACTED BY THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX ACT ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, WHICH REDUCED THE FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%  AND REQUIRED US TO ACCRUE A TRANSITION TAX ON ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE TAX RATE BENEFIT REALIZED IN THE PRIOR YEAR RELATED TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR DEFERRED INCOME TAXES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ACCRUAL OF THE TRANSITION  TAX. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THESE ITEMS, OUR TAX RATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018 WAS 26.3% WHICH WAS COMPARABLE TO THE TAX RATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 OF 25.8% WHICH EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF GOODWILL.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE CAN FLUCTUATE  YEAR-TO-YEAR  DUE TO CHANGES IN THE MIX OF  FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC  PRE-TAX  EARNINGS. IT CAN ALSO FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THE PROPORTION OF  PRE-TAX  EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR MEXICAN RAILCAR MANUFACTURING JOINT  VENTURE. THE JOINT VENTURE IS TREATED AS A PARTNERSHIP FOR TAX PURPOSES AND, AS A RESULT, THE PARTNERSHIP\u2019S ENTIRE  PRE-TAX  EARNINGS ARE INCLUDED IN EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND EARNINGS FROM  UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES, WHEREAS ONLY OUR 50% SHARE OF THE TAX IS INCLUDED IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST  NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST WAS $19.0 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $14.1 MILLION IN THE  PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIOD, WHICH PRIMARILY REPRESENTS OUR JOINT VENTURE PARTNER\u2019S SHARE IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR MEXICAN RAILCAR MANUFACTURING JOINT VENTURE, ADJUSTED FOR INTERCOMPANY SALES, AND OUR EUROPEAN PARTNER\u2019S SHARE OF THE  RESULTS OF OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS.  43  THE GREENBRIER COMPANIES, INC.

THE CHANGE IN CASH USED IN  FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF NOTES PAYABLE AND A CHANGE IN THE NET ACTIVITIES WITH JOINT VENTURE  PARTNERS.  A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.25 PER SHARE WAS DECLARED ON JUNE 28, 2019.  44  THE GREENBRIER COMPANIES, INC.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS AUTHORIZED OUR COMPANY TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

THE COVENANTS ALSO REQUIRE CERTAIN MAXIMUM RATIOS OF DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION AND MINIMUM LEVELS OF FIXED CHARGES  (INTEREST PLUS RENT) COVERAGE. AS OF MAY 31, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL SUCH RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS.  45  THE GREENBRIER COMPANIES, INC.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY SEEK TO REPURCHASE OR OTHERWISE RETIRE OR EXCHANGE SECURITIES, INCLUDING  OUTSTANDING NOTES, BORROWINGS AND EQUITY SECURITIES, AND TAKE OTHER STEPS TO REDUCE OUR DEBT OR OTHERWISE IMPROVE OUR BALANCE SHEET. THESE ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE OPEN MARKET REPURCHASES, UNSOLICITED OR SOLICITED PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED  TRANSACTIONS OR OTHER RETIREMENTS, REPURCHASES OR EXCHANGES. SUCH RETIREMENTS, REPURCHASES OR EXCHANGES, IF ANY, WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, TRADING LEVELS OF OUR DEBT,  OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS, IF APPLICABLE. THE AMOUNTS INVOLVED IN ANY SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, BE MATERIAL AND MAY INVOLVE ALL OR A PORTION OF A PARTICULAR SERIES OF NOTES OR OTHER  INDEBTEDNESS WHICH MAY REDUCE THE FLOAT AND IMPACT THE TRADING MARKET OF NOTES OR OTHER INDEBTEDNESS WHICH REMAIN OUTSTANDING.  WE HAVE GLOBAL OPERATIONS  THAT CONDUCT BUSINESS IN THEIR LOCAL CURRENCIES AS WELL AS OTHER CURRENCIES. TO MITIGATE THE EXPOSURE TO TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS WITH  ESTABLISHED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT THE MARGIN ON A PORTION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES IN FIRM BACKLOG. GIVEN THE STRONG CREDIT STANDING OF THE COUNTERPARTIES, NO PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR CREDIT LOSS DUE TO COUNTERPARTY  NON-PERFORMANCE.

THESE NOTE RECEIVABLES ARE INCLUDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE  SHEET IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET. IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY MAKE LOANS TO OR PROVIDE GUARANTEES FOR AMSTED-MAXION CRUZEIRO OR GREENBRIER-MAXION.  WE EXPECT  EXISTING FUNDS AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH PROCEEDS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCLUDING BORROWINGS UNDER EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES AND LONG-TERM FINANCINGS, TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ACQUISITION OF THE  MANUFACTURING BUSINESS OF AMERICAN RAILCAR INDUSTRIES, EXPECTED DEBT REPAYMENTS, WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES AND DIVIDENDS DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS.  46  THE GREENBRIER COMPANIES, INC.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. REQUIRES JUDGMENT ON THE PART OF MANAGEMENT TO  ARRIVE AT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. THESE ESTIMATES MAY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITHIN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE PERIODICALLY EVALUATED AND MAY BE ADJUSTED IN FUTURE PERIODS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  INCOME TAXES  -  FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, INCOME TAX EXPENSE IS ESTIMATED BASED ON AMOUNTS ANTICIPATED TO BE REPORTED ON TAX RETURN  FILINGS. THOSE ANTICIPATED AMOUNTS MAY CHANGE FROM WHEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED TO WHEN THE TAX RETURNS ARE FILED. FURTHER, BECAUSE TAX FILINGS ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY TAXING AUTHORITIES, THERE IS RISK THAT A POSITION TAKEN IN  PREPARATION OF A TAX RETURN MAY BE CHALLENGED BY A TAXING AUTHORITY. IF A CHALLENGE IS SUCCESSFUL, DIFFERENCES IN TAX EXPENSE OR BETWEEN CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAX ITEMS MAY ARISE IN FUTURE PERIODS. ANY MATERIAL EFFECT OF SUCH DIFFERENCES WOULD BE  REFLECTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHEN MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE EFFECT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF OCCURRING AND THE AMOUNT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. VALUATION ALLOWANCES REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO AMOUNTS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WILL BE REALIZED  BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE WHEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED. THIS INFORMATION MAY INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE INCOME AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.  WARRANTY ACCRUALS  - WARRANTY COSTS TO COVER A DEFINED WARRANTY PERIOD ARE ESTIMATED AND CHARGED TO OPERATIONS. THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY COST IS  BASED ON HISTORICAL WARRANTY CLAIMS FOR EACH PARTICULAR PRODUCT TYPE. FOR NEW PRODUCT TYPES WITHOUT A WARRANTY HISTORY, PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL INFORMATION FOR SIMILAR PRODUCT TYPES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AS  THEY ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND JUDGMENT FOR NEW PRODUCTS. IF WARRANTY CLAIMS ARE MADE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD FOR ISSUES THAT HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN THE SUBJECT OF WARRANTY CLAIMS AND WERE NOT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION  IN ESTABLISHING THE ACCRUAL OR IF CLAIMS FOR ISSUES ALREADY CONSIDERED IN ESTABLISHING THE ACCRUAL EXCEED EXPECTATIONS, WARRANTY EXPENSE MAY EXCEED THE ACCRUAL FOR THAT PARTICULAR PRODUCT. CONVERSELY, THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT CLAIMS MAY BE  LOWER THAN ESTIMATES. THE WARRANTY ACCRUAL IS PERIODICALLY REVIEWED AND UPDATED BASED ON WARRANTY TRENDS. HOWEVER, AS WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN ANY ONE REPORTING PERIOD TO BE MATERIAL.  ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS  - AT TIMES WE MAY BE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. WE ESTIMATE FUTURE COSTS FOR KNOWN  ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS AND ACCRUE FOR THEM WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE HAVE INCURRED A LIABILITY AND THE RELATED COSTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION. IF FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN OR RESOLUTION OF  AN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTER RESULT IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DEVELOP THESE RESERVES, THE ACCRUAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COULD BE MATERIALLY UNDERSTATED OR OVERSTATED. ADJUSTMENTS TO  THESE LIABILITIES ARE MADE WHEN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE THAT AFFECTS THE ESTIMATED COSTS TO STUDY OR REMEDIATE ANY ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES OR WHEN EXPENDITURES FOR WHICH RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED ARE MADE. DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN NATURE OF  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT BECOME INVOLVED IN FUTURE LITIGATION OR OTHER PROCEEDINGS OR, IF WE WERE FOUND TO BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING, THAT SUCH COSTS WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO  US.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  - WE MEASURE REVENUE AT THE AMOUNTS THAT REFLECT THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR  TRANSFERRING CONTROL OF GOODS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE EITHER AT THE POINT IN TIME OR OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS TO CUSTOMERS ARE SATISFIED. PAYMENT TERMS VARY BY SEGMENT AND PRODUCT TYPE AND ARE  GENERALLY DUE WITHIN NORMAL COMMERCIAL TERMS. OUR CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS MAY INCLUDE MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS (E.G. RAILCARS, MAINTENANCE, MANAGEMENT SERVICES, ETC.). FOR SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, WE ALLOCATE REVENUES TO EACH PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATION BASED ON ITS RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE. WE HAVE DISAGGREGATED REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS INTO CATEGORIES WHICH DESCRIBE THE PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH WE GENERATE OUR REVENUES.  47  THE GREENBRIER COMPANIES, INC.  MANUFACTURING  RAILCARS ARE MANUFACTURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 ACCEPTANCE OF THE COMPLETED RAILCARS AT A  SPECIFIED DELIVERY POINT. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO MULTI-YEAR SUPPLY AGREEMENTS. EACH RAILCAR DELIVERY IS CONSIDERED A DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, SUCH THAT THE AMOUNTS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE FOLLOWING RAILCAR DELIVERY ARE  GENERALLY NOT SUBJECT TO CHANGE.  WE TYPICALLY RECOGNIZE MARINE VESSEL MANUFACTURING REVENUE OVER TIME USING THE COST INPUT METHOD, BASED ON PROGRESS  TOWARD CONTRACT COMPLETION MEASURED BY ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED TO DATE IN RELATION TO THE ESTIMATE OF TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS. THIS METHOD BEST DEPICTS OUR PERFORMANCE IN COMPLETING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MARINE VESSEL FOR THE CUSTOMER AND IS CONSISTENT  WITH THE PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION METHOD USED PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW REVENUE STANDARD.  WHEELS, REPAIR & PARTS  WE OPERATE A NETWORK OF WHEEL, REPAIR AND PARTS SHOPS IN NORTH AMERICA THAT PROVIDE COMPLETE WHEELSET RECONDITIONING AND RAILCAR REPAIR SERVICES.  WHEELS REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN WHEELSETS ARE SHIPPED TO THE CUSTOMER OR WHEN CONSUMED BY CUSTOMERS IN THE CASE OF CONSIGNMENT ARRANGEMENTS. PARTS REVENUE  IS RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT OF THE PARTS TO THE CUSTOMERS.  REPAIR REVENUE IS TYPICALLY RECOGNIZED OVER TIME USING THE COST INPUT METHOD, BASED ON  PROGRESS TOWARD CONTRACT COMPLETION MEASURED BY ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED TO DATE IN RELATION TO THE ESTIMATE OF TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS. THIS METHOD BEST DEPICTS OUR PERFORMANCE IN REPAIRING THE RAILCARS FOR THE CUSTOMER. REPAIR SERVICES ARE TYPICALLY  COMPLETED IN LESS THAN 90 DAYS.  LEASING & SERVICES  WE OWN A FLEET OF NEW AND USED CARS WHICH ARE LEASED TO THIRD-PARTY CUSTOMERS. LEASE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE LEASE-TERM IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT IS  EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 840.  LEASES.  SYNDICATION TRANSACTIONS REPRESENT NEW AND USED RAILCARS WHICH HAVE BEEN PLACED ON LEASE TO A CUSTOMER  AND WHICH WE INTEND TO SELL TO AN INVESTOR WITH THE LEASE ATTACHED. AT THE TIME OF SUCH SALE, REVENUE AND COST OF REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH RAILCARS THAT WE HAVE MANUFACTURED ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE MANUFACTURING SEGMENT; WHILE REVENUE AND COST OF  REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH RAILCARS WHICH WERE OBTAINED FROM A THIRD-PARTY WITH THE INTENT TO RESELL THEM AND SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD, ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE LEASING & SERVICES SEGMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 840.  LEASES.  WE ENTER INTO MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS FOR WHICH REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE  BASIS OVER THE CONTRACT TERM AS A STAND-READY OBLIGATION. COSTS TO FULFILL THESE CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS INCURRED.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED  ASSETS  - WHEN CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, THE ASSETS ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FORECAST OF UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT  OF THE ASSETS, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS TO FAIR VALUE WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF THE IMPAIRMENT AND COULD BE MATERIALLY  DIFFERENT IF CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE. IF THE FORECAST OF UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXCEEDS THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSETS IT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE ASSETS WERE NOT IMPAIRED.  GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS  - WE PERIODICALLY ACQUIRE BUSINESSES IN PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THE ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE MAY  RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE VALUE OF SUCH INTANGIBLE ASSETS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE PERIOD AMORTIZATION AND  POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.  48  THE GREENBRIER COMPANIES, INC.  GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY DURING THE THIRD QUARTER.  THE PROVISIONS OF ASC 350.  INTANGIBLES \u2013 GOODWILL AND OTHER,  REQUIRE THAT WE PERFORM THIS TEST BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS BASED ON A  WEIGHTING OF INCOME AND MARKET APPROACHES. UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH, WE CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS WHICH INCORPORATES EXPECTED REVENUE AND MARGINS AND THE USE OF DISCOUNT  RATES. UNDER THE MARKET APPROACH, WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE BASED ON OBSERVED MARKET MULTIPLES FOR COMPARABLE BUSINESSES. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S  FAIR VALUE. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS CANNOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THE REPORTING UNIT. GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE ALSO TESTED MORE FREQUENTLY IF CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE OCCURRENCE OF EVENTS  INDICATES THAT A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. WHEN CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS A DECLINE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, CHANGES IN DEMAND OR IN THE NUMEROUS VARIABLES ASSOCIATED WITH THE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES MADE IN  ASSESSING THE APPROPRIATE VALUATION OF GOODWILL INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF CERTAIN INDEFINITE LIVED ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, THE ASSETS ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT. IF ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS WERE TO DIFFER FROM THESE ASSUMPTIONS, IT  MAY RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL.  BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST, A  NON-CASH  IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $10.0 MILLION WAS RECORDED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 RELATED TO OUR REPAIR REPORTING UNIT. AFTER THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, OUR REMAINING GOODWILL BALANCE WAS $74.3 MILLION AS OF MAY 31, 2019 OF  WHICH $43.3 MILLION RELATED TO OUR WHEELS, REPAIR & PARTS SEGMENT AND $31.0 MILLION RELATED TO OUR MANUFACTURING SEGMENT.  49  THE GREENBRIER COMPANIES, INC.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "GREENBRIER COMPANIES INC", "CIK": 923120, "Date": "2019-07-02T00:00:00", "Ticker": "GBX", "Name": "Greenbrier Companies Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 3743.0, "Business": "OR", "Incorporated": "OR", "IRS": 930816972.0, "key": "20190702GBX", "labelr1": -1.5673981191222546, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": 2.3000707714083455, "labelr4": 1.106883431338638, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.23112099, "prof1": 0.768879, "return1&2": 0.9843260188087776, "return1&2&3": 1.0069662138627655, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0181121560431905, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 0.9843260188087776, "return3": 1.0230007077140837, "return4": 1.0110688343133865, "1_day_return": -1.567398119122254, "cumulative_return1": 0.4149826407822269, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.1620384591208979, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.009104006156665607, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.004859721813161546, "indexx": 1321, "cumreturn1b": 1.0267027997105047, "cumreturndow": 1.007672378472752, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0066943837044624}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1324, "level_0": 2971, "index": 88256, "text": "ITEM 2.

OUR TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS SEGMENT DISTRIBUTES PERIPHERALS, IT SYSTEMS INCLUDING DATA CENTER SERVER AND STORAGE SOLUTIONS, SYSTEM COMPONENTS, SOFTWARE, NETWORKING, COMMUNICATIONS AND SECURITY EQUIPMENT, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, OR CE, AND COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS. WITHIN OUR TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, WE ALSO PROVIDE SYSTEMS DESIGN AND INTEGRATION SOLUTIONS. OUR CONCENTRIX SEGMENT OFFERS A PORTFOLIO OF TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED STRATEGIC SOLUTIONS AND END-TO-END BUSINESS SERVICES FOCUSED ON CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT, PROCESS OPTIMIZATION, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION, FRONT AND BACK-OFFICE AUTOMATION AND BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION TO CLIENTS IN TEN IDENTIFIED INDUSTRY VERTICALS.  IN OUR TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, WE DISTRIBUTE MORE THAN 30,000 TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS (AS MEASURED BY ACTIVE SKUS) FROM MORE THAN 400 IT, CE AND ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS, OR OEM, SUPPLIERS, TO MORE THAN 25,000 RESELLERS, SYSTEM INTEGRATORS, AND RETAILERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, JAPAN AND CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA. WE PURCHASE PERIPHERALS, IT SYSTEMS, SYSTEM COMPONENTS, SOFTWARE, NETWORKING, COMMUNICATIONS, SECURITY EQUIPMENT, CE AND COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND SELL THEM TO OUR RESELLER AND RETAIL CUSTOMERS. WE PERFORM A SIMILAR FUNCTION FOR OUR DISTRIBUTION OF LICENSED SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. OUR RESELLER CUSTOMERS INCLUDE VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS, OR VARS, CORPORATE RESELLERS, GOVERNMENT RESELLERS, SYSTEM INTEGRATORS, DIRECT MARKETERS, AND NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS. WE COMBINE OUR CORE STRENGTHS IN DISTRIBUTION WITH DEMAND GENERATION, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT AND DESIGN AND INTEGRATION SOLUTIONS TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS ACHIEVE GREATER EFFICIENCIES IN TIME TO MARKET, COST MINIMIZATION, REAL-TIME LINKAGES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND AFTER-MARKET PRODUCT SUPPORT. WE ALSO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE IT SOLUTIONS IN KEY VERTICAL MARKETS SUCH AS GOVERNMENT AND HEALTHCARE AND WE PROVIDE SPECIALIZED SERVICE OFFERINGS THAT INCREASE EFFICIENCIES IN THE AREAS OF PRINT MANAGEMENT, RENEWALS, NETWORKING, LOGISTICS SERVICES AND SUPPLY  CHAIN MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, WE PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH SYSTEMS DESIGN AND INTEGRATION SOLUTIONS FOR DATA CENTER SERVERS AND NETWORKING SOLUTIONS BUILT SPECIFIC TO OUR CUSTOMERS' WORKLOADS AND DATA CENTER ENVIRONMENTS.  OUR TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY LOW GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, OR GROSS MARGIN, AND LOW INCOME FROM OPERATIONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, OR OPERATING MARGIN. THE MARKET FOR IT AND CE PRODUCTS IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY DECLINING UNIT PRICES AND SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES. WE SET OUR SALES PRICE BASED ON THE MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND CHARACTERISTICS FOR EACH PRODUCT OR BUNDLE OF PRODUCTS WE DISTRIBUTE AND SERVICES WE PROVIDE.  IN OUR CONCENTRIX SEGMENT, WE PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF STRATEGIC SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS TO ENHANCE OUR CLIENTS' CUSTOMER LIFE CYCLES TO ACQUIRE, SUPPORT AND RENEW CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, TO AUTOMATE AND OPTIMIZE PROCESSES, TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF EVERY CUSTOMER INTERACTION AND TO IMPROVE BUSINESS OUTCOMES.

ANY SHIFT IN BUSINESS OR SIZE OF THE MARKET FOR OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRODUCTS, ANY FAILURE OF TECHNOLOGY OR FAILURE OF ACCEPTANCE OF OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. THE EMPLOYEE TURNOVER RATE IN THIS BUSINESS AND THE RISK OF LOSING EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES IS HIGH. HIGHER TURNOVER RATES CAN INCREASE COSTS AND DECREASE OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND PRODUCTIVITY.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS SINCE 1980 AND ARE HEADQUARTERED IN FREMONT, CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA, ASIA-PACIFIC AND EUROPE. WE WERE ORIGINALLY INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS COMPAC MICROELECTRONICS, INC  . IN NOVEMBER 1980, AND WE CHANGED OUR NAME TO SYNNEX INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, INC. IN FEBRUARY 1994. WE LATER REINCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE UNDER THE NAME OF SYNNEX CORPORATION IN OCTOBER 2003. AS OF  MAY 31, 2019  , WE HAD  OVER 23  1  ,000  FULL  -TIME  AND TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  ON DECEMBER 1, 2018, WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 606 APPLYING THE FULL RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING THIS NEW REVENUE STANDARD AND NOTE 3 FOR OUR REVISED REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY. EXCEPT FOR THE ABOVE, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, WE ADOPTED CERTAIN OTHER NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION OF THESE PRONOUNCEMENTS WAS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  ACQUISITIONS  WE CONTINUALLY SEEK TO AUGMENT ORGANIC GROWTH IN BOTH OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS WITH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS THAT COMPLEMENT AND EXPAND OUR EXISTING CAPABILITIES. WE ALSO DIVEST BUSINESSES THAT WE DEEM NO LONGER STRATEGIC TO OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS. IN OUR TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS WE SEEK TO ACQUIRE NEW OEM RELATIONSHIPS, ENHANCE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES, THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND OEM SUPPLIERS, AND EXPAND OUR GEOGRAPHIC FOOTPRINT. IN OUR CONCENTRIX SEGMENT, WE SEEK TO FURTHER ENHANCE OUR CAPABILITIES AND DOMAIN EXPERTISE IN OUR KEY VERTICALS, EXPAND OUR GEOGRAPHIC FOOTPRINT AND FURTHER EXPAND INTO HIGHER VALUE SERVICE OFFERINGS. WE ARE ALSO STRATEGICALLY FOCUSED ON FURTHER INCREASING OUR SCALE TO SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS.  CONVERGYS ACQUISITION  ON OCTOBER 5, 2018, WE ACQUIRED 100% OF CONVERGYS CORPORATION, A CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE OUTSOURCING COMPANY, FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $2.3 BILLION. THE ACQUISITION IS RELATED TO OUR CONCENTRIX SEGMENT AND WE BELIEVE THE ACQUISITION ADDS SCALE, DIVERSIFIES OUR REVENUE BASE, EXPANDS OUR SERVICE DELIVERY FOOTPRINT AND STRENGTHENS OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION AS A TOP GLOBAL PROVIDER OF CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT SERVICES.

REVENUE IN CONSTANT CURRENCY IS CALCULATED BY TRANSLATING THE REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 IN THE BILLING CURRENCY USING THEIR COMPARABLE PRIOR PERIOD CURRENCY CONVERSION RATE. GENERALLY, WHEN THE DOLLAR EITHER STRENGTHENS OR WEAKENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES, THE GROWTH AT CONSTANT CURRENCY RATES OR ADJUSTING FOR CURRENCY WILL BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN GROWTH REPORTED AT ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES.  \u2022  NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME, WHICH IS OPERATING INCOME AS ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE ACQUISITION-RELATED AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES, AND THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  \u2022  NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN, WHICH IS NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME, AS DEFINED ABOVE, DIVIDED BY REVENUE.  \u2022  ADJUSTED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, OR ADJUSTED EBITDA, WHICH IS NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME, AS DEFINED ABOVE, PLUS DEPRECIATION.  \u2022  NON-GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (\u201cEPS\u201d), WHICH IS DILUTED EPS EXCLUDING THE PER SHARE, TAX EFFECTED IMPACT OF (I) ACQUISITION-RELATED AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES, (II) AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, (III) CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION AND THE PER SHARE AMOUNT OF THE NET IMPACT OF THE ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017.  WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS USEFUL TO THE READER TO BETTER ASSESS AND UNDERSTAND OUR BASE OPERATING PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARING RESULTS WITH PREVIOUS PERIODS AND FOR PLANNING AND FORECASTING IN FUTURE PERIODS, PRIMARILY BECAUSE MANAGEMENT TYPICALLY MONITORS THE BUSINESS ADJUSTED FOR THESE ITEMS IN ADDITION TO GAAP RESULTS. MANAGEMENT ALSO USES THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES TO ESTABLISH OPERATIONAL GOALS AND, IN SOME CASES, FOR MEASURING PERFORMANCE FOR COMPENSATION PURPOSES. AS THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THEY MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES EMPLOYED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

CONSEQUENTLY, THE MARGIN EARNED ON SUCH TRANSACTIONS IS RECORDED AS OUR REVENUE, WITH NO ASSOCIATED COST OF REVENUE, RESULTING IN LOWER REVENUE AND HIGHER GROSS MARGINS. THE REVENUE GENERATED BY OUR CONCENTRIX SEGMENT RELATES TO BUSINESS OUTSOURCING SERVICES FOCUSED ON PROCESS OPTIMIZATION, CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT AND BACK OFFICE AUTOMATION.

DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, OUR INTEREST EXPENSE AND FINANCE CHARGES, NET, INCREASED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS TO FUND THE CONVERGYS ACQUISITION AND SUPPORT GROWTH IN BOTH OF OUR SEGMENTS.

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THIS ITEM, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 27.75% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019. THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, IS DUE TO THE DISCRETE IMPACT OF A TAX BENEFIT OF $17.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017 (\u201cTHE TCJA\u201d) RECORDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.

AS A GENERAL RULE, WHEN SALES VOLUMES ARE INCREASING, OUR NET INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL DOLLARS TYPICALLY INCREASES, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN DECREASED CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. CONVERSELY, WHEN SALES VOLUME DECREASES, OUR NET INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL DOLLARS TYPICALLY DECREASES, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN INCREASES IN CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. CONCENTRIX WORKING CAPITAL IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. OUR CASH CONVERSION  CYCLE WAS 53 DAYS  AND 41 DAYS AS OF MAY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE CONVERGYS ACQUISITION AND THE RESULTANT LARGER CONTRIBUTION OF CONCENTRIX TO OUR OVERALL BUSINESS, HIGHER PROPORTION OF REVENUE RECORDED ON A NET BASIS UNDER PRINCIPAL VERSUS AGENT REVENUE GUIDANCE, AND TIMING OF COLLECTIONS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PAYMENTS OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  TO INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE AND BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MAY FURTHER EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH INVESTMENTS OR ACQUISITIONS. WE EXPECT THAT SUCH EXPANSION WOULD REQUIRE AN INITIAL INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL, PERSONNEL, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS. THESE INVESTMENTS OR ACQUISITIONS WOULD LIKELY BE FUNDED PRIMARILY BY OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS, OR THE ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $47.4 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $290.3 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN INVENTORIES OF $214.3 MILLION, AND A NET CHANGE IN OTHER OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $112.6 MILLION. THESE CASH OUTFLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET INCOME OF $201.6 MILLION, ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS OF $190.3 MILLION, AND A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $176.4 MILLION. TYPICALLY, REVENUE IN BOTH OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE ARE HIGHEST IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER AND LOWER IN INTERIM PERIODS WHICH RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. THE INCREASE IN INVENTORIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO BUSINESS GROWTH IN OUR SYSTEMS DESIGN AND INTEGRATION BUSINESS WHERE WE CARRY HIGHER LEVELS OF INVENTORIES. THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, A $19.0 MILLION GAIN RECORDED UPON THE SETTLEMENT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO OUR WESTCON-COMSTOR AMERICAS ACQUISITION IN FISCAL YEAR 2017, AND DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $62.7  MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET INCOME OF $117.8 MILLION, A DECREASE IN  ACCOUNTS AND VENDOR RECEIVABLES OF $103.1 MILLION, ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS OF $82.2 MILLION, A NET CHANGE IN OTHER OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $61.7 MILLION AND A DECREASE IN INVENTORIES OF $39.9 MILLION. THESE CASH INFLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $342.1 MILLION.  TYPICALLY, REVENUE IN BOTH OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE ARE HIGHEST IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER AND LOWER IN INTERIM PERIODS WHICH RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS.  THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND THE DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO THE NEW U.S. TAX RATE DUE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET  CASH  USED IN  INVESTING  ACTIVITIES DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  WAS  $65.9  MILLION,  PRIMARILY DUE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  OF  $60.4  MILLION  RELATED  TO INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT GROWTH IN BOTH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS  AND $6.2 MILLION OF CASH PAID RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS ASSUMED UNDER THE CONVER  GYS ACQUISITION.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME CONSISTS OF NET SALES LESS COST OF SALES AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIABLE TO A SEGMENT. FOR A RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME TO CONSOLIDATED  OPERATING INCOME, SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR QUARTERLY CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  ORDERS AND BACKLOG  OUR ENTIRE BACKLOG, WHICH IS INCLUSIVE OF TRANSACTION TAXES FOR CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, RELATES TO OUR ENERGY SEGMENT AND WAS  $300.1 MILLION  AS OF  MAY 31, 2019  , A DECREASE OF  $32.8 MILLION  , OR  9.9%  , AS COMPARED TO  $332.9 MILLION  AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  . OUR BACKLOG DECREASED  $4.8 MILLION  , OR  1.6%  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , OUR INCOMING NET ORDERS DECREASED BY  $39.4 MILLION  , OR  13.3%  WHEN COMPARED TO SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL  2019  AND OUR BOOK-TO-REVENUE RATIO DECREASED TO  0.89  TO 1 FROM  1.13  TO 1. THESE DECREASES WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SOFTNESS IN NET BOOKINGS DUE TO LOWER OVERALL INTERNATIONAL PROJECT BOOKINGS. THE DECREASES IN BACKLOG WERE ALSO DUE TO HIGHER OVERALL REVENUES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  RELATED PRIMARILY TO CERTAIN LARGE INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS THAT WERE BOOKED IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND COMMENCED REVENUE RECOGNITION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 UPON SATISFYING THE REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA.  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE TABLE BELOW INCLUDES THE PROGRESSION OF BACKLOG (IN THOUSANDS).

THIS  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A GENERAL UPTICK IN THE SALES OF OUR ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS, THE SATISFACTION OF THE REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA FOR CERTAIN LARGE INTERNATIONAL ELECTRICAL PROJECTS THAT WERE BOOKED IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND THE WESTINGHOUSE SETTLEMENT NOTED FURTHER BELOW. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN REVENUES FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS, WHICH WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER INTERNATIONAL REVENUES RESULTING FROM A LARGE REFINING PROJECT RECORDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD.  REVENUES FOR THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT  INCREASED  $6.9 MILLION  OR  6.0%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL  2019  . THIS  INCREASE  WAS THE RESULT OF SLIGHTLY HIGHER SELLING PRICES AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER VOLUMES OF STEEL PROCESSED DUE PRIMARILY TO OUR ACQUISITION OF TENNESSEE GALVANIZING, INC. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED VOLUMES FROM THE SOLAR AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKETS AND INCREMENTAL REVENUES FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF K2 PARTNERS, INC., ALSO DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR RECENT ACQUISITIONS IN THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OPERATING MARGINS WERE  7.5%  AND  6.8%  , FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THESE  INCREASES  WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE POSITIVE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PROJECT MARGINS FOR OUR ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUES FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT  INCREASED  BY  $4.2 MILLION  OR  16.7%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL  2019  . IN ADDITION, OPERATING MARGINS IMPROVED TO  24.1%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  21.9%  , FOR THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. THESE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASED VOLUMES AND SELLING PRICES NOTED ABOVE AND A DECLINE IN ZINC COSTS.  CORPORATE EXPENSES  CORPORATE EXPENSES  DECREASED  BY  $0.5 MILLION  OR  4.4%  , FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SLIGHTLY LOWER SPENDING FOR OUTSIDE SERVICES.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  WAS  $3.6 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $3.8 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER AVERAGE OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES AND WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON VARIABLE RATE DEBT. OUR GROSS DEBT TO EQUITY RATIO WAS  0.48  TO 1 AS OF  MAY 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  0.56  TO 1 AS OF  MAY 31, 2018.  INCOME TAXES  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES REFLECTS AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  21.1%  AND  22.0%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO STATE TAX BENEFITS.  WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY BANKRUPTCY CASE  WE HAD EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH SUBSIDIARIES OF WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY (\u201cWEC\u201d). WEC AND THE RELEVANT SUBSIDIARIES (THE \"DEBTORS\") FILED RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE ON MARCH 29, 2017 IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, JOINTLY ADMINISTERED AS IN RE WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY, ET AL., CASE NO. 17-10751 (THE \"BANKRUPTCY CASE\"). THE COMPANY HAS BEEN COLLECTING ON POST-PETITION AMOUNTS DUE AND OWED. ON FEBRUARY 22, 2018, THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK APPROVED THE DEBTORS\u2019 MODIFIED FIRST AMENDED DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FOR THE JOINT CHAPTER 11 PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. IN THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, THE DEBTORS ESTIMATED A 98.9% TO 100% DISTRIBUTION ON ALLOWED GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS. WE FILED APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION OF SUCH CLAIMS WITH THE COURT, WHICH INCLUDES 100% OF OUR PRE-PETITION CLAIMS. IN APRIL 2019, FOR ONE OF OUR PLANTS, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE THIRD PARTY BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATOR RELATED TO OUTSTANDING CLAIMS. THE AGREEMENT AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $8.1 MILLION REPRESENTED 100% OF THOSE OUTSTANDING CLAIMS FOR SUCH PLANT. THE IMPACT OF THE SETTLEMENT NOTED ABOVE HAD NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON OPERATING INCOME FOR THE PERIOD. INCLUDING THE ABOVE NOTED SETTLEMENT AND APPROXIMATELY $2.1 MILLION OF ADJUSTMENTS TO THE INITIAL CLAIM AMOUNTS, $1.8 MILLION OF CLAIMS REMAIN OUTSTANDING, OF WHICH $0.6 MILLION HAS BEEN RESERVED.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY MET OUR CASH NEEDS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ALONG WITH BANK AND BOND MARKET DEBT. OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS ARE GENERALLY FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES, CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, DEBT REPAYMENT, ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH POSITION, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR EXPECTATION OF CONTINUING AVAILABILITY TO DRAW UPON OUR CREDIT FACILITIES ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CASH FLOW NEEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  CASH FLOWS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOWS BY CATEGORY FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED (IN THOUSANDS).  THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31,  2019  2018  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(18,587  )  $(12,366  )  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (43,469  )  (10,847  )  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  51,560  16,796  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $18.6 MILLION  , NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $43.5 MILLION  , NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $51.6 MILLION  , AND A DECREASE OF  $0.1 MILLION  FROM THE NET EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH RESULTING IN A NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $10.4 MILLION  . IN COMPARISON TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN FISCAL  2019  , THE RESULTS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , ARE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LESS FAVORABLE IMPACTS OF CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL THAT WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME. THE COMPANY'S USE OF CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS HIGHER DUE TO INCREASED SPENDING ON ACQUISITIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS HIGHER DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED NET BORROWINGS.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL WAS  $258.2 MILLION  AS OF  MAY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO  $213.8 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  FINANCING AND CAPITAL  AS OF  MAY 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD  $297.0 MILLION  OF FLOATING AND FIXED RATE NOTES OUTSTANDING WITH VARYING MATURITIES THROUGH FISCAL 2023 AND THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE COVENANTS RELATED TO THESE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS. AS OF  MAY 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY $259.3 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CREDIT AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE DRAWS OR LETTERS OF CREDIT.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS SEE NOTE 7 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FURTHER BELOW UNDER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  IN JANUARY OF 2012, OUR BOARD AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO TEN PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE, AND THE AMOUNT AND PRICES PAID FOR ANY FUTURE SHARE PURCHASES UNDER THE AUTHORIZATION WILL BE BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS AT THE TIME OF THE PURCHASE. REPURCHASES UNDER THIS SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION WOULD BE MADE THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, INCLUDING RULE 10B-18 UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT. THE COMPANY DID NOT MAKE ANY REPURCHASES OF ITS COMMON SHARES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019.  OTHER EXPOSURES  WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY PRICE INCREASES IN BOTH SEGMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS, PRIMARILY COPPER, ALUMINUM, STEEL AND NICKEL BASED ALLOYS IN THE ENERGY SEGMENT AND ZINC AND NATURAL GAS IN THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT. WE ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE THESE INCREASES THROUGH ESCALATION CLAUSES IN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS FOR COPPER, ALUMINUM, STEEL AND NICKEL BASED ALLOYS, WHEN MARKET CONDITIONS ALLOW AND THROUGH FIXED COST CONTRACT PURCHASES ON ZINC. IN ADDITION TO THESE MEASURES, WE ATTEMPT TO RECOVER OTHER COST INCREASES THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, AND THROUGH INCREASES IN PRICES WHERE COMPETITIVELY FEASIBLE.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  AS OF  MAY 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS DEFINED UNDER SEC RULES.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GAAP REQUIRES US TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON CURRENT FACTS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO DETERMINE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.

A NUMBER OF OUR SALES INCENTIVES, SUCH AS BOTTLER FUNDING TO INDEPENDENT BOTTLERS AND CUSTOMER VOLUME REBATES, ARE BASED ON ANNUAL TARGETS, AND ACCRUALS ARE ESTABLISHED DURING THE YEAR FOR THE EXPECTED PAYOUT.  THESE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACT TERMS AND OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR PROGRAMS AND REQUIRE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT WITH RESPECT TO ESTIMATING CUSTOMER PARTICIPATION AND PERFORMANCE LEVELS. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ESTIMATED EXPENSE AND ACTUAL INCENTIVE COSTS ARE NORMALLY INSIGNIFICANT AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DIFFERENCES ARE DETERMINED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN ADVERTISING AND MARKETING COSTS ARE ALSO BASED ON ANNUAL TARGETS AND RECOGNIZED DURING THE YEAR AS INCURRED.  FOR INTERIM REPORTING, OUR POLICY IS TO ALLOCATE OUR FORECASTED FULL-YEAR SALES INCENTIVES FOR MOST OF OUR PROGRAMS TO EACH OF OUR INTERIM REPORTING PERIODS IN THE SAME YEAR THAT BENEFITS FROM THE PROGRAMS. THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON OUR FORECASTED SALES INCENTIVES FOR THE FULL YEAR AND THE PROPORTION OF EACH INTERIM PERIOD\u2019S ACTUAL GROSS REVENUE OR VOLUME, AS APPLICABLE, TO OUR FORECASTED ANNUAL GROSS REVENUE OR VOLUME, AS APPLICABLE. BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF THE FORECASTS AT EACH INTERIM PERIOD, ANY CHANGES IN ESTIMATES AND THE RELATED ALLOCATION OF SALES INCENTIVES ARE RECOGNIZED BEGINNING IN THE INTERIM PERIOD THAT THEY ARE IDENTIFIED. IN ADDITION, WE APPLY A SIMILAR ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY FOR INTERIM REPORTING PURPOSES FOR CERTAIN ADVERTISING AND OTHER MARKETING ACTIVITIES.  INCOME TAXES  IN DETERMINING OUR QUARTERLY PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, WE USE AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WHICH IS BASED ON OUR EXPECTED ANNUAL INCOME, STATUTORY TAX RATES AND TAX PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO US IN THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD. IN EACH OF THE  12 AND 24 WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE REDUCED NET REVENUE GROWTH BY  3  PERCENTAGE POINTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN THE RUSSIAN RUBLE, TURKISH LIRA, EURO, ARGENTINE PESO AND BRAZILIAN REAL. CURRENCY DECLINES AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR WHICH ARE NOT OFFSET COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.  IN ADDITION, VOLATILE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND CIVIL UNREST IN CERTAIN MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD, INCLUDING IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, MEXICO, THE MIDDLE EAST, RUSSIA AND TURKEY, AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IN CERTAIN OF THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, CONTINUE TO, AND THE THREAT OR IMPOSITION OF TARIFFS IN OR RELATED TO THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS MAY, RESULT IN CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO THE UNITED KINGDOM\u2019S PENDING WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, INCLUDING HOW THE UNITED KINGDOM WILL INTERACT WITH OTHER EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES FOLLOWING ITS DEPARTURE, AS WELL AS THE ECONOMIC, OPERATING AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN RUSSIA AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT FOR THE ESSA SEGMENT AND OUR OTHER BUSINESSES.  CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD HAVE EITHER IMPOSED, OR ARE CONSIDERING IMPOSING, NEW OR INCREASED TAXES OR REGULATIONS ON THE MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION OR SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING, INGREDIENTS OR SUBSTANCES CONTAINED IN, OR ATTRIBUTES OF, OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING, COMMODITIES USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING OR THE RECYCLABILITY OR RECOVERABILITY OF OUR PACKAGING. THESE TAXES AND REGULATIONS VARY IN SCOPE AND FORM. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME TAXES APPLY TO ALL BEVERAGES, INCLUDING NON-CALORIC BEVERAGES, WHILE OTHERS APPLY ONLY TO BEVERAGES WITH A CALORIC SWEETENER (E.G., SUGAR). IN ADDITION, SOME REGULATIONS APPLY TO ALL PRODUCTS USING CERTAIN TYPES OF PACKAGING (E.G., PLASTIC), WHILE OTHERS ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF PACKAGING AND ENCOURAGE WASTE REDUCTION AND INCREASED RECYCLING RATES.  WE SELL A WIDE VARIETY OF BEVERAGES, FOODS AND SNACKS IN MORE THAN  200  COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES AND THE PROFILE OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL, THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH PRODUCTS AND THE TYPE OF PACKAGING USED VARIES BY JURISDICTION. BECAUSE OF THIS, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE SCOPE OR FORM POTENTIAL TAXES, REGULATIONS OR OTHER LIMITATIONS ON OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING MAY TAKE, AND THEREFORE CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT OF SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS OR LIMITATIONS ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, TAXES, REGULATIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY IMPACT US AND OUR COMPETITORS DIFFERENTLY. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR EXISTING AND PROPOSED TAXES AND REGULATIONS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED AND SOLD AND TO CONSIDER ACTIONS WE MAY TAKE TO POTENTIALLY MITIGATE THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OR LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING ADVOCATING ALTERNATIVE MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPOSITION, FORM AND SCOPE OF ANY SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS OR LIMITATIONS.  ADDITIONALLY, OUR INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO BE AFFECTED BY DISRUPTION OF THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE, INCLUDING THE RAPID GROWTH IN SALES THROUGH E-COMMERCE WEBSITES AND MOBILE COMMERCE APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, THE INTEGRATION OF PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL OPERATIONS AMONG RETAILERS AND THE INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION OF HARD DISCOUNTERS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR CHANGES IN THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE AND TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS WE MAY TAKE TO BUILD OUR GLOBAL E-COMMERCE CAPABILITIES, DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS EFFECTIVELY THROUGH ALL EXISTING AND EMERGING CHANNELS OF TRADE AND POTENTIALLY MITIGATE ANY UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS ON OUR FUTURE RESULTS.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, THE TCJ ACT WAS ENACTED IN THE UNITED STATES.  WHILE OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE RECORDED IMPACT OF THE  TCJ ACT  AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018 WAS DEEMED TO BE COMPLETE  , THIS AMOUNT WAS BASED ON PREVAILING REGULATIONS AND AVAILABLE INFORMATION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018, AND ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE  IRS  IMPACTED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO IMPACT, OUR RECORDED AMOUNTS AFTER DECEMBER 29, 2018.

NON-GAAP MEASURES  CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-Q ADJUST FOR THE IMPACT OF SPECIFIED ITEMS AND ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP). WE USE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES INTERNALLY TO MAKE OPERATING AND STRATEGIC DECISIONS, INCLUDING THE PREPARATION OF OUR ANNUAL OPERATING PLAN, EVALUATION OF OUR OVERALL BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND AS A FACTOR IN DETERMINING COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. WE BELIEVE PRESENTING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THIS FORM 10-Q PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO FACILITATE COMPARISON OF OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS AND TRENDS IN OUR UNDERLYING OPERATING RESULTS, AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY ON HOW WE EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS. WE ALSO BELIEVE PRESENTING THESE MEASURES IN THIS FORM 10-Q ALLOWS INVESTORS TO VIEW OUR PERFORMANCE USING THE SAME MEASURES THAT WE USE IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS.  WE CONSIDER QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS IN ASSESSING WHETHER TO ADJUST FOR THE IMPACT OF ITEMS THAT MAY BE SIGNIFICANT OR THAT COULD AFFECT AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR ONGOING FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OR TRENDS. EXAMPLES OF ITEMS FOR WHICH WE MAY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE.  AMOUNTS RELATED TO MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS OR LOSSES (NON-CASH); CHARGES RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS; CHARGES OR ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE ENACTMENT OF NEW LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS, SUCH AS SIGNIFICANT TAX LAW CHANGES; AMOUNTS RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF TAX POSITIONS; TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO REORGANIZATIONS OF OUR OPERATIONS; AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND OTHER STRUCTURAL CHANGES; DEBT REDEMPTIONS, CASH TENDER OR EXCHANGE OFFERS; PENSION AND RETIREE MEDICAL RELATED ITEMS; ASSET IMPAIRMENTS (NON-CASH); AND REMEASUREMENTS OF NET MONETARY ASSETS.  SEE BELOW AND \u201cITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY\u201d FOR A DESCRIPTION OF ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  NON-GAAP INFORMATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPLEMENTAL IN NATURE AND IS NOT MEANT TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.

WE ALSO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE ON OPERATING PROFIT, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PEPSICO PER COMMON SHARE  \u2013  DILUTED, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, WHICH MEASURE OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ASSUMING CONSTANT FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES USED FOR TRANSLATION BASED ON THE RATES IN EFFECT FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. IN ORDER TO COMPUTE OUR CONSTANT CURRENCY RESULTS, WE MULTIPLY OR DIVIDE, AS APPROPRIATE, OUR CURRENT-YEAR U.S. DOLLAR RESULTS BY THE CURRENT-YEAR AVERAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND THEN MULTIPLY OR DIVIDE, AS APPROPRIATE, THOSE AMOUNTS BY THE PRIOR-YEAR AVERAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. WE BELIEVE THESE MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION IN EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY EXCLUDE ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING PERFORMANCE.  ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH  WE DEFINE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AS NET REVENUE GROWTH ADJUSTED FOR THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT FROM ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND OTHER STRUCTURAL CHANGES. WE BELIEVE ORGANIC REVENUE PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION IN EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF ONGOING PERFORMANCE OR THAT WE BELIEVE IMPACT COMPARABILITY WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.  SEE \u201cNET REVENUE AND ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH\u201d IN \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \u2013  DIVISION REVIEW\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  FREE CASH FLOW  WE DEFINE FREE CASH FLOW AS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS CAPITAL SPENDING, PLUS SALES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. SINCE NET CAPITAL SPENDING IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR PRODUCT INNOVATION INITIATIVES AND MAINTAINING OUR OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS A RECURRING AND NECESSARY USE OF CASH. AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE INVESTORS SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER NET CAPITAL SPENDING WHEN EVALUATING OUR CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. FREE CASH FLOW IS USED BY US PRIMARILY FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING DEBT REPAYMENTS, DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. FREE CASH FLOW IS NOT A MEASURE OF CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES SINCE WE HAVE CERTAIN NON-DISCRETIONARY OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS DEBT SERVICE THAT ARE NOT DEDUCTED FROM THE MEASURE.

COMMODITY DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT ARE MARKED TO MARKET EACH PERIOD WITH THE RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES RECORDED IN CORPORATE UNALLOCATED EXPENSES AS EITHER COST OF SALES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, DEPENDING ON THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY.

AS OF  JUNE 15, 2019  , WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH IN OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES OF $3.0 BILLION, INCLUDING RESTRICTED CASH HELD OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES OF APPROXIMATELY $0.1 BILLION RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF SODASTREAM. SEE NOTE 12 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF RESTRICTED CASH. AS OF  JUNE 15, 2019  , CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO CURRENCY CONTROLS OR CURRENCY EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS WERE NOT MATERIAL.  THE TCJ ACT IMPOSED A MANDATORY ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON UNDISTRIBUTED INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS. AS OF  JUNE 15, 2019  , OUR MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY WAS $3.4 BILLION. UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE TCJ ACT, THIS TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY MUST BE PAID OVER EIGHT YEARS. ANY ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE IRS MAY IMPACT OUR RECORDED AMOUNTS FOR THIS TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY. SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE TCJ ACT.

THE OPERATING CASH FLOW PERFORMANCE PRIMARILY REFLECTS DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS OF $1.6 BILLION TO OUR PENSION AND RETIREE MEDICAL PLANS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE NET WORKING CAPITAL COMPARISONS TO 2018 AND HIGHER NET CASH TAX PAYMENTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  24  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $3.3 BILLION  , PRIMARILY REFLECTING $1.9 BILLION OF CASH PAID IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF SODASTREAM, AS WELL AS NET CAPITAL SPENDING OF $1.1 BILLION.  WE EXPECT  2019  NET CAPITAL SPENDING TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $4.5 BILLION.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  24  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , NET CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $5.4 BILLION  , PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE RETURN OF OPERATING CASH FLOW TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES OF  $4.4 BILLION  AND PAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT BORROWINGS OF  $3.0 BILLION  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $1.1 BILLION  AND NET PROCEEDS OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS OF $0.7 BILLION.  WE ANNUALLY REVIEW OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE WITH OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, INCLUDING OUR DIVIDEND POLICY AND SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2018, WE ANNOUNCED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM PROVIDING FOR  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $15.0 BILLION OF PEPSICO COMMON STOCK WHICH COMMENCED ON JULY 1, 2018 AND WILL EXPIRE ON JUNE 30, 2021.

THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES THERETO CONTAINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM  10-Q.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A MARYLAND CORPORATION  THAT HAS ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A BDC UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, AS AMENDED (THE \u201c1940 ACT\u201d). OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE ATTRACTIVE RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS BY GENERATING CURRENT INCOME AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL  APPRECIATION FROM OUR INVESTMENTS. WE INVEST PRIMARILY IN SENIOR AND UNITRANCHE LEVERAGED LOANS AND MEZZANINE DEBT ISSUED BY PRIVATE U.S.    MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES, WHICH WE DEFINE AS COMPANIES HAVING EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST,  TAX, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) OF BETWEEN $2 MILLION AND $50 MILLION, BOTH THROUGH DIRECT LENDING AND THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN LOAN SYNDICATES. WE MAY ALSO INVEST UP TO 30.0% OF THE PORTFOLIO IN OPPORTUNISTIC  INVESTMENTS IN ORDER TO SEEK TO ENHANCE RETURNS TO STOCKHOLDERS. SUCH INVESTMENTS MAY INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN DISTRESSED DEBT, WHICH MAY INCLUDE SECURITIES OF COMPANIES IN BANKRUPTCY, FOREIGN DEBT, PRIVATE EQUITY, SECURITIES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT  ARE NOT THINLY TRADED AND STRUCTURED FINANCE VEHICLES SUCH AS COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATION FUNDS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO CURRENT INTENTION TO DO SO, TO THE EXTENT WE INVEST IN PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, WE WILL LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES THAT ARE  EXCLUDED FROM THE DEFINITION OF \u201cINVESTMENT COMPANY\u201d UNDER SECTION 3(C)(1) OR SECTION 3(C)(7) OF THE 1940 ACT, WHICH INCLUDES PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, TO NO MORE THAN 15.0% OF ITS NET ASSETS. WE HAVE ELECTED AND QUALIFIED TO BE  TREATED AS A RIC UNDER SUBCHAPTER M OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE \u201cCODE\u201d).  CORPORATE HISTORY AND RECENT  DEVELOPMENTS  WE COMMENCED OPERATIONS, AT THE TIME KNOWN AS GSC INVESTMENT CORP., ON MARCH 23, 2007 AND COMPLETED AN INITIAL  PUBLIC OFFERING OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ON MARCH 28, 2007. PRIOR TO JULY 30, 2010, WE WERE EXTERNALLY MANAGED AND ADVISED BY GSCP (NJ), L.P., AN ENTITY AFFILIATED WITH GSC GROUP, INC. IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSUMMATION OF A  RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTION ON JULY 30, 2010, AS DESCRIBED BELOW WE ENGAGED SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS (\u201cSIA\u201d) TO REPLACE GSCP (NJ), L.P. AS OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER AND CHANGED OUR NAME TO SARATOGA INVESTMENT CORP.  AS A RESULT OF THE EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER A REVOLVING SECURITIZED CREDIT FACILITY WITH DEUTSCHE BANK WE PREVIOUSLY HAD IN PLACE, IN DECEMBER  2008 WE ENGAGED THE INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM OF STIFEL, NICOLAUS &  77  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMPANY TO EVALUATE STRATEGIC TRANSACTION OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES FOR US. ON APRIL 14, 2010, GSC INVESTMENT CORP. ENTERED INTO A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH SARATOGA  INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES AND AN ASSIGNMENT, ASSUMPTION AND NOVATION AGREEMENT WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, PURSUANT TO WHICH GSC INVESTMENT CORP. ASSUMED CERTAIN RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS  UNDER A DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS RECEIVED FROM MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC, WHICH INDICATED MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING\u2019S WILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE GSC INVESTMENT CORP. WITH A $40.0 MILLION SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING  CREDIT FACILITY, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, GSC INVESTMENT CORP. AND GSCP (NJ), L.P. ENTERED INTO A TERMINATION AND RELEASE AGREEMENT, TO BE EFFECTIVE AS OF THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED  BY THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO WHICH GSCP (NJ), L.P., AMONG OTHER THINGS, AGREED TO WAIVE ANY AND ALL ACCRUED AND UNPAID DEFERRED INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEES UP TO AND AS OF THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THE STOCK  PURCHASE AGREEMENT BUT CONTINUED TO BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEES EARNED THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT.  ON JULY 30, 2010, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND CERTAIN OF ITS  AFFILIATES WERE COMPLETED, THE PRIVATE SALE OF 986,842 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR $15.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE TO SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES CLOSED, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO THE CREDIT FACILITY,  AND THE COMPANY BEGAN DOING BUSINESS AS SARATOGA INVESTMENT CORP.  WE USED THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE PRIVATE SALE TRANSACTION AND A  PORTION OF THE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO US UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY TO PAY THE FULL AMOUNT OF PRINCIPAL AND ACCRUED INTEREST, INCLUDING DEFAULT INTEREST, OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVING SECURITIZED CREDIT FACILITY WITH DEUTSCHE BANK. THE REVOLVING  SECURITIZED CREDIT FACILITY WITH DEUTSCHE BANK WAS TERMINATED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PAYMENT OF ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING THEREUNDER ON JULY 30, 2010.  ON AUGUST 12, 2010, WE EFFECTED A  ONE-FOR-TEN  REVERSE  STOCK SPLIT OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. AS A RESULT OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT, EVERY TEN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WERE CONVERTED INTO ONE SHARE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. ANY FRACTIONAL SHARES RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT WERE  REDEEMED FOR CASH. THE TOTAL CASH PAYMENT IN LIEU OF SHARES WAS $230. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT, WE HAD 2,680,842 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING.

THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING WERE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGIES. FINANCING COSTS OF $1.6 MILLION RELATED TO THE 2025 NOTES HAVE BEEN CAPITALIZED AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER  THE TERM OF THE 2025 NOTES.  ON DECEMBER 14, 2018, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE THIRD REFINANCING OF THE SARATOGA CLO (THE  \u201c2013-1  RESET CLO NOTES\u201d).

CONCURRENTLY, THE EXISTING $4.5 MILLION OF CLASS F NOTES WERE REPAID.  ON FEBRUARY 5, 2019, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A  RE-OPENING  AND  UP-SIZING  OF ITS EXISTING 2025 NOTES BY ISSUING AN ADDITIONAL $20.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $19.2 MILLION AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING COMMISSIONS OF APPROXIMATELY  $0.6 MILLION AND DISCOUNT OF $0.2 MILLION. OFFERING COSTS INCURRED WERE APPROXIMATELY $0.2 MILLION. THE ISSUANCE INCLUDED THE FULL EXERCISE OF THE UNDERWRITERS\u2019 OPTION TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL $2.5 MILLION AGGREGATE  PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2025 NOTES WITHIN 30 DAYS. INTEREST RATE, INTEREST PAYMENT DATES AND MATURITY REMAIN UNCHANGED FROM THE EXISTING 2025 NOTES ISSUED IN AUGUST 2018. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THIS OFFERING WERE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES IN  ACCORDANCE WITH OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGIES. THE FINANCING COSTS AND DISCOUNT OF $1.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE 2025 NOTES HAVE BEEN CAPITALIZED AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE 2025 NOTES.  AT MAY 31, 2019, THE TOTAL 2025 NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $60.0 MILLION. THE 2025 NOTES ARE LISTED ON THE NYSE UNDER THE TRADING SYMBOL  \u201cSAF\u201d WITH A PAR VALUE OF $25.00 PER SHARE.  79  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  BASIS OF PRESENTATION  THE  PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECTING AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED INVESTMENT VALUATION, REVENUE RECOGNITION AND THE RECOGNITION OF CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE EXPENSE AS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES. WE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED  TO THE MATTERS DESCRIBED BELOW. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO US AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM  THOSE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. A DISCUSSION OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOLLOWS.  INVESTMENT VALUATION  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD  (\u201cFASB\u201d) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 820,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURES  (\u201cASC 820\u201d). ASC 820 DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FAIR  VALUE HIERARCHY BASED ON THE QUALITY OF INPUTS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE AND ENHANCES DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. ASC 820 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO ASSUME THAT ITS INVESTMENTS ARE TO BE SOLD OR ITS LIABILITIES ARE TO BE  TRANSFERRED AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE IN THE PRINCIPAL MARKET TO INDEPENDENT MARKET PARTICIPANTS, OR IN THE ABSENCE OF A PRINCIPAL MARKET, IN THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET, WHICH MAY BE A HYPOTHETICAL MARKET. MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE DEFINED AS BUYERS  AND SELLERS IN THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET THAT ARE INDEPENDENT, KNOWLEDGEABLE, AND WILLING AND ABLE TO TRANSACT.  INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE READILY AVAILABLE ARE FAIR VALUED AT SUCH MARKET QUOTATIONS OBTAINED FROM INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY  PRICING SERVICES AND MARKET MAKERS SUBJECT TO ANY DECISION BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO APPROVE A FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION TO REFLECT SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFFECTING THE VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS. WE VALUE INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE  NOT READILY AVAILABLE AT FAIR VALUE AS APPROVED, IN GOOD FAITH, BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS BASED ON INPUT FROM SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND A THIRD PARTY INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM. DETERMINATIONS OF  FAIR VALUE MAY INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES. THE TYPES OF FACTORS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS INCLUDE THE NATURE AND REALIZABLE VALUE OF ANY COLLATERAL, THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY  TO MAKE PAYMENTS, MARKET YIELD TREND ANALYSIS, THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY DOES BUSINESS, COMPARISON TO PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS.  WE UNDERTAKE A MULTI-STEP VALUATION PROCESS EACH QUARTER WHEN VALUING INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE, AS  DESCRIBED BELOW.  \u2022  EACH INVESTMENT IS INITIALLY VALUED BY THE RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS OF SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS  AND PRELIMINARY VALUATION CONCLUSIONS ARE DOCUMENTED AND DISCUSSED WITH OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT; AND  \u2022  AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM ENGAGED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWS A SELECTION OF THESE  PRELIMINARY VALUATIONS EACH QUARTER SO THAT THE VALUATION OF EACH INVESTMENT FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE IS REVIEWED BY THE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM AT LEAST ONCE EACH FISCAL YEAR. WE USE A PARTY INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM TO  VALUE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE SUBORDINATED NOTES OF SARATOGA CLO AND THE  CLASS F-R-2  NOTES AND  CLASS G-R-2  NOTES TRANCHES OF THE SARATOGA CLOS EVERY QUARTER.  IN ADDITION, ALL OUR INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING VALUATION PROCESS.  \u2022  THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEWS AND APPROVES EACH PRELIMINARY VALUATION AND SARATOGA  INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM (IF APPLICABLE) WILL SUPPLEMENT THE PRELIMINARY VALUATION TO REFLECT ANY COMMENTS PROVIDED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE; AND  80  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSES THE VALUATIONS AND APPROVES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH INVESTMENT, IN GOOD FAITH,  BASED ON THE INPUT OF SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM (TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE) AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS BASED ON A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT UTILIZES PREPAYMENT,  RE-  INVESTMENT AND LOSS ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND PROJECTED PERFORMANCE, ECONOMIC FACTORS, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING CASH FLOW, AND COMPARABLE YIELDS FOR EQUITY INTERESTS IN  COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATION FUNDS SIMILAR TO SARATOGA CLO, WHEN AVAILABLE, AS DETERMINED BY SIA AND RECOMMENDED TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. SPECIFICALLY, WE USE INTEX CASH FLOW MODELS, OR AN APPROPRIATE SUBSTITUTE, TO FORM THE BASIS FOR THE  VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO. THE MODELS USE A SET OF ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING PROJECTED DEFAULT RATES, RECOVERY RATES, REINVESTMENT RATE AND PREPAYMENT RATES IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT ESTIMATED VALUATIONS. THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON  AVAILABLE MARKET DATA AND PROJECTIONS PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES. WE USE THE OUTPUT FROM THE INTEX MODELS (I.E., THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS) TO PERFORM A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO  DETERMINE A VALUATION FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  INCOME RECOGNITION  INTEREST INCOME,  ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUM AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNT, IS RECORDED ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. THE COMPANY STOPS ACCRUING INTEREST ON ITS INVESTMENTS WHEN IT IS DETERMINED THAT INTEREST  IS NO LONGER COLLECTIBLE. DISCOUNTS AND PREMIUMS ON INVESTMENTS PURCHASED ARE ACCRETED/AMORTIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE RESPECTIVE INVESTMENT USING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD. THE AMORTIZED COST OF INVESTMENTS REPRESENTS THE ORIGINAL COST ADJUSTED FOR  THE ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS AND AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS ON INVESTMENTS.  LOANS ARE GENERALLY PLACED ON  NON-ACCRUAL  STATUS WHEN THERE IS REASONABLE DOUBT THAT PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST WILL BE COLLECTED. ACCRUED INTEREST IS GENERALLY RESERVED WHEN A LOAN IS PLACED ON  NON-ACCRUAL  STATUS. INTEREST PAYMENTS RECEIVED ON  NON-ACCRUAL  LOANS MAY BE RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION IN PRINCIPAL DEPENDING UPON MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT REGARDING  COLLECTABILITY.  NON-ACCRUAL  LOANS ARE RESTORED TO ACCRUAL STATUS WHEN PAST DUE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS PAID AND, IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT, ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN CURRENT, ALTHOUGH WE MAY MAKE EXCEPTIONS  TO THIS GENERAL RULE IF THE LOAN HAS SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL VALUE AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION.  PAYMENT-IN-KIND  INTEREST  THE COMPANY HOLDS DEBT AND PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN ITS  PORTFOLIO THAT CONTAIN A  PAYMENT-IN-KIND  (\u201cPIK\u201d) INTEREST PROVISION.  THE PIK INTEREST, WHICH REPRESENTS CONTRACTUALLY DEFERRED INTEREST ADDED TO THE INVESTMENT BALANCE THAT IS GENERALLY DUE AT MATURITY, IS  GENERALLY RECORDED ON THE ACCRUAL BASIS TO THE EXTENT SUCH AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. WE STOP ACCRUING PIK INTEREST IF WE DO NOT EXPECT THE ISSUER TO BE ABLE TO PAY ALL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WHEN DUE.  REVENUES  WE GENERATE REVENUE IN  THE FORM OF INTEREST INCOME AND CAPITAL GAINS ON THE DEBT INVESTMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, ON EQUITY INTERESTS THAT WE MAY ACQUIRE. WE EXPECT OUR DEBT INVESTMENTS, WHETHER IN THE FORM OF LEVERAGED LOANS OR MEZZANINE DEBT, TO HAVE  TERMS OF UP TO TEN YEARS, AND TO BEAR INTEREST AT EITHER A FIXED OR FLOATING RATE. INTEREST ON DEBT WILL BE PAYABLE GENERALLY EITHER QUARTERLY OR SEMI-ANNUALLY. IN SOME CASES, OUR DEBT OR PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR A PORTION OR ALL  OF THE INTEREST TO BE PIK. TO THE EXTENT INTEREST IS PIK, IT WILL BE PAYABLE THROUGH THE INCREASE OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE OBLIGATION BY THE AMOUNT OF  81  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST DUE ON THE THEN-OUTSTANDING AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SUCH OBLIGATION. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE DEBT AND ANY ACCRUED BUT UNPAID INTEREST WILL GENERALLY BECOME DUE AT THE MATURITY  DATE. IN ADDITION, WE MAY GENERATE REVENUE IN THE FORM OF COMMITMENT, ORIGINATION, STRUCTURING OR DILIGENCE FEES, FEES FOR PROVIDING MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE OR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND POSSIBLY CONSULTING FEES. ANY SUCH FEES WILL BE  GENERATED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INVESTMENTS AND RECOGNIZED AS EARNED. WE MAY ALSO INVEST IN PREFERRED EQUITY OR COMMON EQUITY SECURITIES THAT PAY DIVIDENDS ON A CURRENT BASIS.  ON JANUARY 22, 2008, WE ENTERED INTO A COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH SARATOGA CLO, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE ACT AS ITS COLLATERAL  MANAGER. THE SARATOGA CLO WAS INITIALLY REFINANCED IN OCTOBER 2013 WITH ITS REINVESTMENT PERIOD EXTENDED TO OCTOBER 2016. ON NOVEMBER 15, 2016, WE COMPLETED A SECOND REFINANCING OF THE SARATOGA CLO WITH ITS REINVESTMENT PERIOD EXTENDED TO  OCTOBER 2018.  ON DECEMBER 14, 2018, WE COMPLETED A THIRD REFINANCING AND UPSIZE OF THE SARATOGA CLO. THE THIRD SARATOGA CLO  REFINANCING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EXTENDED ITS REINVESTMENT PERIOD TO JANUARY 2021, AND EXTENDED ITS LEGAL MATURITY DATE TO JANUARY 2030. A  NON-CALL  PERIOD OF JANUARY 2020 WAS ALSO ADDED. FOLLOWING THIS  REFINANCING, THE SARATOGA CLO PORTFOLIO INCREASED FROM APPROXIMATELY $300.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT TO APPROXIMATELY $500.0 MILLION OF PREDOMINANTLY SENIOR SECURED FIRST LIEN TERM LOANS. IN ADDITION TO REFINANCING ITS  LIABILITIES, WE INVESTED AN ADDITIONAL $13.8 MILLION IN ALL OF THE NEWLY ISSUED SUBORDINATED NOTES OF THE SARATOGA CLO AND ALSO PURCHASED $2.5 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE  CLASS F-R-2  AND $7.5 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE  CLASS G-R-2  NOTES TRANCHES AT PAR, WITH A  COUPON OF LIBOR PLUS 8.75% AND LIBOR PLUS 10.00%, RESPECTIVELY. AS PART OF THIS REFINANCING, WE ALSO REDEEMED OUR EXISTING $4.5 MILLION AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE CLASS F NOTES TRANCHE AT PAR.  THE SARATOGA CLO REMAINS EFFECTIVELY 100% OWNED AND MANAGED BY SARATOGA INVESTMENT CORP. WE RECEIVE A BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.10% PER ANNUM  AND A SUBORDINATED MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.40% PER ANNUM OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SARATOGA CLO\u2019S ASSETS, PAID QUARTERLY TO THE EXTENT OF AVAILABLE PROCEEDS. PRIOR TO THE SECOND REFINANCING AND THE ISSUANCE OF THE  2013-1  AMENDED CLO NOTES, WE RECEIVED A BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.25% PER ANNUM AND A SUBORDINATED MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.25% PER ANNUM OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SARATOGA CLO\u2019S ASSETS, PAID QUARTERLY  TO THE EXTENT OF AVAILABLE PROCEEDS.  FOLLOWING THE THIRD REFINANCING AND THE ISSUANCE OF THE  2013-1  RESET CLO NOTES ON DECEMBER 14, 2018, WE ARE NO LONGER ENTITLED TO AN INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE EQUAL TO 20.0% OF EXCESS CASH FLOW TO THE EXTENT THE SARATOGA CLO SUBORDINATED NOTES RECEIVE AN  INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN PAID IN CASH EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 12.0%.  INTEREST INCOME ON OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO IS RECORDED USING  THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ASC TOPIC  325-40,  INVESTMENTS-OTHER, BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS  (\u201cASC  325-40\u201d),  BASED ON THE ANTICIPATED YIELD AND THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS OVER THE PROJECTED LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT. YIELDS ARE REVISED WHEN THERE ARE CHANGES IN ACTUAL OR ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS DUE TO CHANGES  IN PREPAYMENTS AND/OR  RE-INVESTMENTS,  CREDIT LOSSES OR ASSET PRICING. CHANGES IN ESTIMATED YIELD ARE RECOGNIZED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE ESTIMATED YIELD OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT FROM THE DATE  THE ESTIMATED YIELD WAS CHANGED.  ASC 606  IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ASU  2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (\u201cASC  606\u201d), WHICH SUPERSEDES THE REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS IN REVENUE RECOGNITION (ASC 605). UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT  REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN MAY 2016, ASU  2016-12  AMENDED ASU  2014-09  AND DEFERRED  THE EFFECTIVE PERIOD FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017. MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE MAJORITY OF ITS REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE SCOPED OUT OF ASC 606, AND HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT  IMPACT RELATES TO THE TIMING OF THE RECOGNITION OF THE CLO INCENTIVE FEE INCOME. WE ADOPTED ASC 606 UNDER THE MODIFIED  82  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH USING THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT PROVIDED FOR, THEREFORE THE PRESENTATION OF PRIOR PERIODS HAS NOT BEEN ADJUSTED.  EXPENSES  OUR PRIMARY OPERATING  EXPENSES INCLUDE THE PAYMENT OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT FEES, PROFESSIONAL FEES, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INSURANCE, FEES PAID TO INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND ADMINISTRATOR EXPENSES, INCLUDING OUR ALLOCABLE PORTION OF OUR ADMINISTRATOR\u2019S  OVERHEAD. OUR INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT FEES COMPENSATE OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER FOR ITS WORK IN IDENTIFYING, EVALUATING, NEGOTIATING, CLOSING AND MONITORING OUR INVESTMENTS. WE BEAR ALL OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES OF OUR OPERATIONS AND  TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO.  \u2022  ORGANIZATION;  \u2022  CALCULATING OUR NET ASSET VALUE (INCLUDING THE COST AND EXPENSES OF ANY INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM);  \u2022  EXPENSES INCURRED BY OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING AGENTS, CONSULTANTS OR OTHER  ADVISERS, IN MONITORING OUR FINANCIAL AND LEGAL AFFAIRS AND IN MONITORING OUR INVESTMENTS AND PERFORMING DUE DILIGENCE ON OUR PROSPECTIVE PORTFOLIO COMPANIES;  \u2022  EXPENSES INCURRED BY OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER PAYABLE FOR TRAVEL AND DUE DILIGENCE ON OUR PROSPECTIVE PORTFOLIO  COMPANIES;  \u2022  INTEREST PAYABLE ON DEBT, IF ANY, INCURRED TO FINANCE OUR INVESTMENTS;  \u2022  OFFERINGS OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES;  \u2022  INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT FEES;  \u2022  FEES PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING AGENTS, CONSULTANTS OR OTHER ADVISERS, RELATING TO, OR ASSOCIATED WITH,  EVALUATING AND MAKING INVESTMENTS;  \u2022  TRANSFER AGENT AND CUSTODIAL FEES;  \u2022  FEDERAL AND STATE REGISTRATION FEES;  \u2022  ALL COSTS OF REGISTRATION AND LISTING OUR COMMON STOCK ON ANY SECURITIES EXCHANGE;  \u2022  FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES;  \u2022  INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS\u2019 FEES AND EXPENSES;  \u2022  COSTS OF PREPARING AND FILING REPORTS OR OTHER DOCUMENTS REQUIRED BY GOVERNMENTAL BODIES (INCLUDING THE U.S.  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) AND THE SBA);  \u2022  COSTS OF ANY REPORTS, PROXY STATEMENTS OR OTHER NOTICES TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDING PRINTING COSTS;  \u2022  OUR FIDELITY BOND, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS ERRORS AND OMISSIONS LIABILITY INSURANCE, AND ANY OTHER INSURANCE  PREMIUMS;  \u2022  DIRECT COSTS AND EXPENSES OF ADMINISTRATION, INCLUDING PRINTING, MAILING, LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE, COPYING,  SECRETARIAL AND OTHER STAFF, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS AND OUTSIDE LEGAL COSTS; AND  \u2022  ADMINISTRATION FEES AND ALL OTHER EXPENSES INCURRED BY US OR, IF APPLICABLE, THE ADMINISTRATOR IN CONNECTION WITH  ADMINISTERING OUR BUSINESS (INCLUDING PAYMENTS UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT BASED UPON OUR ALLOCABLE PORTION OF THE ADMINISTRATOR\u2019S OVERHEAD IN PERFORMING ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER AN ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT, INCLUDING RENT AND THE ALLOCABLE  PORTION OF THE COST OF OUR OFFICERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE STAFFS (INCLUDING TRAVEL EXPENSES)).  PURSUANT TO THE INVESTMENT  ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT THAT WE HAD WITH GSCP (NJ), L.P., OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER AND ADMINISTRATOR, WE HAD AGREED TO PAY GSCP (NJ), L.P. AS INVESTMENT ADVISER A  83  TABLE OF CONTENTS  QUARTERLY BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OF 1.75% OF THE AVERAGE VALUE OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS (OTHER THAN CASH OR CASH EQUIVALENTS BUT INCLUDING ASSETS PURCHASED WITH BORROWED FUNDS) AT THE END OF THE TWO MOST  RECENTLY COMPLETED FISCAL QUARTERS AND AN INCENTIVE FEE.  THE INCENTIVE FEE HAD TWO PARTS.  \u2022  A FEE, PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ARREARS, EQUAL TO 20.0% OF OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPRESSED AS A RATE OF RETURN ON THE VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS AT THE END OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING QUARTER, THAT EXCEEDED A 1.875% QUARTERLY HURDLE RATE MEASURED AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER. UNDER THIS  PROVISION, IN ANY FISCAL QUARTER, OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER RECEIVED NO INCENTIVE FEE UNLESS OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME EXCEEDED THE HURDLE RATE OF 1.875%. AMOUNTS RECEIVED AS A RETURN OF CAPITAL  WERE NOT INCLUDED IN CALCULATING THIS PORTION OF THE INCENTIVE FEE. SINCE THE HURDLE RATE WAS BASED ON NET ASSETS, A RETURN OF LESS THAN THE HURDLE RATE ON TOTAL ASSETS COULD STILL HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCENTIVE FEE.  \u2022  A FEE, PAYABLE AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, EQUAL TO 20.0% OF OUR NET REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, COMPUTED  NET OF ALL REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES AND UNREALIZED CAPITAL DEPRECIATION, IN EACH CASE ON A CUMULATIVE BASIS ON EACH INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY\u2019S PORTFOLIO, LESS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEES PAID TO THE INVESTMENT ADVISER  THROUGH SUCH DATE.  WE DEFERRED CASH PAYMENT OF ANY INCENTIVE FEE OTHERWISE EARNED BY OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER IF,  DURING THE THEN MOST RECENT FOUR FULL FISCAL QUARTERS ENDING ON OR PRIOR TO THE DATE SUCH PAYMENT WAS TO BE MADE, THE SUM OF (A) OUR AGGREGATE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND (B) OUR CHANGE IN NET ASSETS (DEFINED AS TOTAL ASSETS LESS  LIABILITIES) (BEFORE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY INCENTIVE FEES PAYABLE DURING THAT PERIOD) WAS LESS THAN 7.5% OF OUR NET ASSETS AT THE BEGINNING OF SUCH PERIOD. THESE CALCULATIONS WERE APPROPRIATELY  PRO-RATED  FOR  THE FIRST THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF OPERATION AND ADJUSTED FOR ANY SHARE ISSUANCES OR REPURCHASES DURING THE APPLICABLE PERIOD. SUCH INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BECOME PAYABLE ON THE NEXT DATE ON WHICH SUCH TEST HAD BEEN SATISFIED FOR THE MOST RECENT FOUR  FULL FISCAL QUARTERS OR UPON CERTAIN TERMINATIONS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. WE COMMENCED DEFERRING CASH PAYMENT OF INCENTIVE FEES DURING THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2007 AND CONTINUED TO DEFER SUCH PAYMENTS  THROUGH THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2010. AS OF JULY 30, 2010, THE DATE ON WHICH GSCP (NJ), L.P. CEASED TO BE OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER AND ADMINISTRATOR, WE OWED GSCP (NJ), L.P. $2.9 MILLION IN FEES FOR SERVICES PREVIOUSLY  PROVIDED TO US; OF WHICH $0.3 MILLION HAS BEEN PAID BY US. GSCP (NJ), L.P. AGREED TO WAIVE PAYMENT BY US OF THE REMAINING $2.6 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSUMMATION OF THE STOCK PURCHASE TRANSACTION WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS  AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT.  THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT  WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT ADVISER, ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WE HAD ENTERED INTO WITH GSCP (NJ), L.P., OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER, EXCEPT FOR THE  FOLLOWING MATERIAL DISTINCTIONS IN THE FEE TERMS.  \u2022  THE CAPITAL GAINS PORTION OF THE INCENTIVE FEE WAS RESET WITH RESPECT TO GAINS AND LOSSES FROM MAY 31, 2010,  AND THEREFORE LOSSES AND GAINS INCURRED PRIOR TO SUCH TIME WILL NOT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN CALCULATING THE CAPITAL GAINS FEE PAYABLE TO SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND, AS A RESULT, SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS WILL BE ENTITLED TO 20.0% OF NET  GAINS THAT ARISE AFTER MAY 31, 2010. IN ADDITION, THE COST BASIS FOR COMPUTING REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS HELD BY US AS OF MAY 31, 2010 EQUAL THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENT AS OF SUCH DATE. UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY  AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER, GSCP (NJ), L.P., THE CAPITAL GAINS FEE WAS CALCULATED FROM MARCH 21, 2007, AND THE GAINS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY OUTWEIGHED BY LOSSES.  \u2022  UNDER THE \u201cCATCH UP\u201d PROVISION, 100.0% OF OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE  NET INVESTMENT INCOME WITH RESPECT TO THAT PORTION OF SUCH  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME THAT EXCEEDS 1.875% BUT IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 2.344% IN ANY FISCAL QUARTER IS PAYABLE TO SARATOGA  INVESTMENT ADVISORS. THIS WILL ENABLE SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS TO RECEIVE 20.0% OF ALL NET INVESTMENT INCOME AS SUCH AMOUNT  84  TABLE OF CONTENTS  APPROACHES 2.344% IN ANY QUARTER, AND SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS WILL RECEIVE 20.0% OF ANY ADDITIONAL NET INVESTMENT INCOME. UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR  FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER, GSCP (NJ), L.P. ONLY RECEIVED 20.0% OF THE EXCESS NET INVESTMENT INCOME OVER 1.875%.  \u2022  WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE DEFERRAL RIGHTS REGARDING INCENTIVE FEES IN THE EVENT THAT THE DISTRIBUTIONS TO  STOCKHOLDERS AND CHANGE IN NET ASSETS IS LESS THAN 7.5% FOR THE PRECEDING FOUR FISCAL QUARTERS.  CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE  THE COMPANY RECORDS AN EXPENSE ACCRUAL RELATING TO THE CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE PAYABLE BY THE COMPANY TO ITS MANAGER WHEN THE UNREALIZED  GAINS ON ITS INVESTMENTS EXCEED ALL REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES ON ITS INVESTMENTS GIVEN THE FACT THAT A CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BE OWED TO THE MANAGER IF THE COMPANY WERE TO LIQUIDATE ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT SUCH TIME. THE ACTUAL  INCENTIVE FEE PAYABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGER RELATED TO CAPITAL GAINS WILL BE DETERMINED AND PAYABLE IN ARREARS AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR AND WILL INCLUDE ONLY REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS FOR THE PERIOD.  REGULATORY MATTERS  IN AUGUST 2018, THE  SEC ISSUED FINAL RULE RELEASE  NO.33-10532,  DISCLOSURE UPDATE AND SIMPLIFICATION  , WHICH IN PART AMENDS CERTAIN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF REGULATION  S-X  THAT HAVE  BECOME REDUNDANT, DUPLICATIVE, OVERLAPPING, OUTDATED, OR SUPERSEDED, IN LIGHT OF OTHER COMMISSION DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, U.S. GAAP OR CHANGES IN THE INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT. THE AMENDMENTS ARE INTENDED TO FACILITATE THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION  TO INVESTORS AND SIMPLIFY COMPLIANCE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERING THE TOTAL MIX OF INFORMATION PROVIDED TO INVESTORS. THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR THESE DISCLOSURES WAS NOVEMBER 5, 2018, EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER THAT BEGINS AFTER THE  EFFECTIVE DATE. MANAGEMENT HAS ADOPTED THESE AMENDMENTS AS CURRENTLY REQUIRED AND THESE ARE REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. THE PRESENTATION OF CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR INFORMATION HAS BEEN  ADJUSTED TO CONFORM WITH THESE AMENDMENTS.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN AUGUST 2018, FASB ISSUED ASU  2018-13  , FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820): DISCLOSURE  FRAMEWORK\u2014CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  (\u201cASU  2018-13\u201d).  THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF ASU  2018-13  IS TO IMPROVE THE  EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE CHANGES AFFECT ALL COMPANIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT DISCLOSURES. IN GENERAL, THE AMENDMENTS IN ASU  2018-13  ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL ENTITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019. AN ENTITY IS PERMITTED TO EARLY ADOPT THE REMOVED OR MODIFIED  DISCLOSURES UPON THE ISSUANCE OF ASU  2018-13  AND MAY DELAY ADOPTION OF THE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, WHICH ARE REQUIRED FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES ONLY, UNTIL THEIR EFFECTIVE DATE. MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THESE  CHANGES AND DOES NOT BELIEVE THEY WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES.  IN MARCH 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU  2017-08,  RECEIVABLES \u2014 NONREFUNDABLE FEES AND OTHER COSTS  (SUBTOPIC  310-20),  PREMIUM AMORTIZATION ON PURCHASED CALLABLE DEBT SECURITIES  (\u201cASU  2017-08\u201d)  WHICH AMENDS THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR CERTAIN PURCHASED  CALLABLE DEBT SECURITIES HELD AT A PREMIUM, SHORTENING SUCH PERIOD TO THE EARLIEST CALL DATE. ASU  2017-08  DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY ACCOUNTING CHANGE FOR DEBT SECURITIES HELD AT A DISCOUNT; THE DISCOUNT CONTINUES  TO BE AMORTIZED TO MATURITY. ASU  2017-08  IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THESE CHANGES AND  CONCLUDED THESE CHANGES DO NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES.  85  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW  MAY 31, 2019  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  ($ IN MILLIONS)  NUMBER OF INVESTMENTS(1)  66  58  NUMBER OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES(2)  33  31  AVERAGE INVESTMENT PER PORTFOLIO COMPANY(2)  $11.3  $11.8  AVERAGE INVESTMENT SIZE(1)  $5.8  $6.5  WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY(3)  3.5YRS  3.6YRS  NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES  8  8  NON-PERFORMING  OR DELINQUENT INVESTMENTS (FAIR  VALUE)  $4.8  $5.7  FIXED RATE DEBT (% OF INTEREST EARNING PORTFOLIO)(3)  $56.8(16.7%)  $55.7(16.3%)  FIXED RATE DEBT (WEIGHTED AVERAGE CURRENT COUPON)(3)  10.4%  10.4%  FLOATING RATE DEBT (% OF INTEREST EARNING PORTFOLIO)(3)  $284.0(83.3%)  $285.0(83.7%)  FLOATING RATE DEBT (WEIGHTED AVERAGE CURRENT SPREAD OVER LIBOR)(3)(4)  8.5%  8.6%  (1)  EXCLUDES OUR INVESTMENT IN THE SUBORDINATED NOTES OF SARATOGA CLO.

IN ADDITION, WE INTEND TO DISTRIBUTE TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME IN  ORDER TO SATISFY THE DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT APPLICABLE TO RICS UNDER THE CODE. IN SATISFYING THIS DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT, WE HAVE IN THE PAST RELIED ON INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (\u201cIRS\u201d) ISSUED PRIVATE LETTER RULINGS CONCLUDING THAT A  RIC MAY TREAT A DISTRIBUTION OF ITS OWN STOCK AS FULFILLING ITS RIC DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS IF EACH STOCKHOLDER MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE HIS OR HER ENTIRE DISTRIBUTION IN EITHER CASH OR STOCK OF THE RIC SUBJECT TO A LIMITATION ON THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT  OF CASH TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH LIMITATION MUST BE AT LEAST 20.0% OF THE AGGREGATE DECLARED DISTRIBUTION. WE MAY RELY ON THESE IRS PRIVATE LETTER RULINGS IN FUTURE PERIODS TO SATISFY OUR RIC DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT.  ALSO, AS A BDC, WE GENERALLY ARE REQUIRED TO MEET A COVERAGE RATIO OF TOTAL ASSETS, LESS LIABILITIES AND INDEBTEDNESS NOT REPRESENTED BY  SENIOR SECURITIES, TO TOTAL SENIOR SECURITIES, WHICH INCLUDE ALL OF OUR BORROWINGS AND ANY OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK, OF AT LEAST 200.0%, REDUCED TO 150.0% EFFECTIVE APRIL 16, 2019 FOLLOWING THE APPROVAL RECEIVED FROM THE  NON-INTERESTED  BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON APRIL 16, 2018. THIS REQUIREMENT LIMITS THE AMOUNT THAT WE MAY BORROW. OUR ASSET COVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN THE 1940 ACT, WAS 238.9% AS OF MAY 31, 2019 AND 234.5% AS  OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019. TO FUND GROWTH IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IN THE FUTURE, WE ANTICIPATE NEEDING TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FROM VARIOUS SOURCES, INCLUDING THE EQUITY MARKETS AND OTHER DEBT-RELATED MARKETS, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE  AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL.  CONSEQUENTLY, WE MAY NOT HAVE THE FUNDS OR THE ABILITY TO FUND NEW INVESTMENTS, TO MAKE  ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, TO FUND OUR UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO PORTFOLIO COMPANIES OR TO REPAY BORROWINGS. ALSO, THE ILLIQUIDITY OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO SELL THESE INVESTMENTS WHEN DESIRED  AND, IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO SELL THESE INVESTMENTS, WE MAY REALIZE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THEIR RECORDED VALUE.  MADISON REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF THE TERMS OF THE SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WE ENTERED INTO WITH MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC  (THE \u201cCREDIT FACILITY\u201d) ON JUNE 30, 2010, WHICH WAS MOST RECENTLY AMENDED ON MAY 18, 2017.  AVAILABILITY.  THE  COMPANY CAN DRAW UP TO THE LESSER OF (I) $40.0 MILLION (THE \u201cFACILITY AMOUNT\u201d) AND (II) THE PRODUCT OF THE APPLICABLE ADVANCE RATE (WHICH VARIES FROM 50.0% TO 75.0% DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF LOAN ASSET) AND THE VALUE, DETERMINED  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cADJUSTED BORROWING VALUE\u201d), OF CERTAIN  94  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d LOAN ASSETS PLEDGED AS SECURITY FOR THE LOAN (THE \u201cBORROWING BASE\u201d), IN EACH CASE LESS (A) THE AMOUNT OF ANY UNDRAWN FUNDING COMMITMENTS THE COMPANY HAS UNDER  ANY LOAN ASSET AND WHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY AMOUNTS IN THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT REFERRED TO BELOW (THE \u201cUNFUNDED EXPOSURE AMOUNT\u201d) AND OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS. EACH LOAN ASSET HELD BY THE COMPANY AS OF THE DATE ON WHICH THE CREDIT  FACILITY WAS CLOSED WAS VALUED AS OF THAT DATE AND EACH LOAN ASSET THAT THE COMPANY ACQUIRES AFTER SUCH DATE WILL BE VALUED AT THE LOWEST OF ITS FAIR VALUE, ITS FACE VALUE (EXCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST) AND THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR SUCH LOAN ASSET.  ADJUSTMENTS TO THE VALUE OF A LOAN ASSET WILL BE MADE TO REFLECT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN ITS FAIR VALUE, A DEFAULT BY THE OBLIGOR ON THE LOAN ASSET, INSOLVENCY OF THE OBLIGOR, ACCELERATION OF THE LOAN ASSET, AND CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS TO THE  TERMS OF THE LOAN ASSET.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPE OF LOAN ASSETS THAT ARE \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d TO BE INCLUDED  IN THE BORROWING BASE AND AS TO THE CONCENTRATION LEVEL OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF LOAN ASSETS IN THE BORROWING BASE SUCH AS RESTRICTIONS ON GEOGRAPHIC AND INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS, ASSET SIZE AND QUALITY, PAYMENT FREQUENCY, STATUS AND TERMS, AVERAGE  LIFE, AND COLLATERAL INTERESTS. IN ADDITION, IF AN ASSET IS TO REMAIN AN \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d LOAN ASSET, THE COMPANY MAY NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THE PAYMENT, AMORTIZATION, COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN OTHER TERMS OF THE LOAN ASSETS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE  ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT THAT WILL EITHER RESULT IN SUBORDINATION OF THE LOAN ASSET OR BE MATERIALLY ADVERSE TO THE LENDERS.  COLLATERAL.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY (OTHER THAN ASSETS HELD BY OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY) AND INCLUDES THE SUBORDINATED NOTES (\u201cCLO NOTES\u201d) ISSUED BY SARATOGA CLO AND THE COMPANY\u2019S RIGHTS  UNDER THE CLO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED BELOW).  INTEREST RATE AND FEES.  UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, FUNDS ARE BORROWED FROM  OR THROUGH CERTAIN LENDERS AT THE GREATER OF THE PREVAILING LIBOR RATE AND 1.00%, PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN OF 4.75%. AT THE COMPANY\u2019S OPTION, FUNDS MAY BE BORROWED BASED ON AN ALTERNATIVE BASE RATE, WHICH IN NO EVENT WILL BE LESS THAN 2.00%,  AND THE APPLICABLE MARGIN OVER SUCH ALTERNATIVE BASE RATE IS 3.75%. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PAYS THE LENDERS A COMMITMENT FEE OF 0.75% PER YEAR ON THE UNUSED AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE DURATION OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD (DEFINED BELOW).  ACCRUED INTEREST AND COMMITMENT FEES ARE PAYABLE MONTHLY. THE COMPANY WAS ALSO OBLIGATED TO PAY CERTAIN OTHER FEES TO THE LENDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING OF THE CREDIT FACILITY.  REVOLVING PERIOD AND MATURITY DATE.  THE COMPANY MAY MAKE AND REPAY BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS  FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cREVOLVING PERIOD\u201d). THE REVOLVING PERIOD MAY BE TERMINATED AT AN EARLIER TIME BY THE COMPANY OR, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, BY ACTION OF THE LENDERS OR AUTOMATICALLY. ALL  BORROWINGS AND OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY ARE DUE AND PAYABLE IN FULL FIVE YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD.  COLLATERAL TESTS.  IT IS A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO ANY BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY THAT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER  THE CREDIT FACILITY, AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE PROPOSED BORROWINGS, NOT EXCEED THE LESSER OF THE BORROWING BASE OR THE FACILITY AMOUNT (THE \u201cBORROWING BASE TEST\u201d). IN ADDITION TO SATISFYING THE BORROWING BASE TEST, THE FOLLOWING TESTS  MUST ALSO BE SATISFIED (TOGETHER WITH BORROWING BASE TEST, THE \u201cCOLLATERAL TESTS\u201d).  \u2022  INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO.  THE RATIO (EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE) OF INTEREST COLLECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO  PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS, LESS CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSES RELATING TO THE CREDIT FACILITY, TO ACCRUED INTEREST AND COMMITMENT FEES AND ANY BREAKAGE COSTS PAYABLE TO THE LENDERS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE LAST 6 PAYMENT PERIODS MUST EQUAL AT LEAST  175.0%.  \u2022  OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO.  THE RATIO (EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE) OF THE AGGREGATE ADJUSTED BORROWING  VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS PLUS THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN INELIGIBLE PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS AND THE CLO NOTES (IN EACH CASE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS) TO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY PLUS THE UNFUNDED  EXPOSURE AMOUNT MUST EQUAL AT LEAST 200.0%.  \u2022  WEIGHTED AVERAGE FMV TEST.  THE AGGREGATE ADJUSTED OR WEIGHTED VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN  ASSETS AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE AGGREGATE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS  95  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MUST BE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 72.0% AND 80.0% DURING THE  ONE-YEAR  PERIODS PRIOR TO THE FIRST AND SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE, RESPECTIVELY,  AND 85.0% AT ALL TIMES THEREAFTER.  THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO REQUIRES PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OR REPLACEMENT  OF PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S BREACH OF ITS REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY THAT PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS INCLUDED IN THE BORROWING BASE ARE \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d LOAN ASSETS. SUCH PAYMENTS OR REPLACEMENTS MUST EQUAL THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT  BY WHICH THE BORROWING BASE IS OVERSTATED AS A RESULT OF SUCH BREACH OR ANY DEFICIENCY UNDER THE COLLATERAL TESTS AT THE TIME OF REPAYMENT OR REPLACEMENT. COMPLIANCE WITH THE COLLATERAL TESTS IS ALSO A CONDITION TO THE DISCRETIONARY SALE OF PLEDGED  LOAN ASSETS BY THE COMPANY.  PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS.  DURING THE REVOLVING PERIOD, THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS PROVISIONS OF THE CREDIT  FACILITY REQUIRE, AFTER PAYMENT OF SPECIFIED FEES AND EXPENSES AND ANY NECESSARY FUNDING OF THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT, THAT COLLECTIONS OF PRINCIPAL FROM THE LOAN ASSETS AND, TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE ARE INSUFFICIENT, COLLECTIONS OF INTEREST  FROM THE LOAN ASSETS, BE APPLIED ON EACH PAYMENT DATE TO PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS IF THE BORROWING BASE TEST, THE OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO AND THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE MET. SIMILARLY, FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF  THE REVOLVING PERIOD, COLLECTIONS OF INTEREST ARE REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED, AFTER PAYMENT OF CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSES, TO CURE ANY DEFICIENCIES IN THE BORROWING BASE TEST, THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND THE OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO AS OF THE  RELEVANT PAYMENT DATE.  RESERVE ACCOUNT.  THE CREDIT FACILITY REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO SET ASIDE AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE SUM OF  ACCRUED INTEREST, COMMITMENT FEES AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES DUE AND PAYABLE ON THE NEXT SUCCEEDING THREE PAYMENT DATES (OR CORRESPONDING TO THREE PAYMENT PERIODS). IF FOR ANY MONTHLY PERIOD DURING WHICH FEES AND OTHER PAYMENTS ACCRUE, THE  AGGREGATE ADJUSTED BORROWING VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS WHICH DO NOT PAY CASH INTEREST AT LEAST QUARTERLY EXCEEDS 15.0% OF THE AGGREGATE ADJUSTED BORROWING VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY IS  REQUIRED TO SET ASIDE SUCH INTEREST AND FEES DUE AND PAYABLE ON THE NEXT SUCCEEDING SIX PAYMENT DATES. AMOUNTS IN THE RESERVE ACCOUNT CAN BE APPLIED SOLELY TO THE PAYMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES, COMMITMENT FEES, ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST AND  ANY BREAKAGE COSTS PAYABLE TO THE LENDERS.  UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT.  WITH RESPECT TO REVOLVER OR DELAYED DRAW LOAN ASSETS, THE  COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO SET ASIDE IN A DESIGNATED ACCOUNT (THE \u201cUNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT\u201d) 100.0% OF ITS OUTSTANDING AND UNDRAWN FUNDING COMMITMENTS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH LOAN ASSETS. THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT IS FUNDED AT THE TIME THE  COMPANY ACQUIRES A REVOLVER OR DELAYED DRAW LOAN ASSET AND REQUESTS A RELATED BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT IS FUNDED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PROCEEDS OF THE REQUESTED BORROWING AND OTHER COMPANY FUNDS, AND IF  FOR ANY REASON SUCH AMOUNTS ARE INSUFFICIENT, THROUGH APPLICATION OF THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENT PROVISIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  OPERATING  EXPENSES.  THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS PROVISION OF THE CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES FOR THE PAYMENT OF CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE COMPANY OUT OF COLLECTIONS ON PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST DURING THE REVOLVING PERIOD AND OUT OF COLLECTIONS ON INTEREST  FOLLOWING THE TERMINATION OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRIORITY ESTABLISHED IN SUCH PROVISION. THE OPERATING EXPENSES PAYABLE PURSUANT TO THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENT PROVISIONS IS LIMITED TO $350,000 FOR EACH MONTHLY PAYMENT DATE OR  $2.5 MILLION FOR THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING PERIOD OF TWELVE CONSECUTIVE MONTHLY PAYMENT DATES. THIS CEILING CAN BE INCREASED BY THE LESSER OF 5.0% OR THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ALL THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS ONLY ON THE  FIRST MONTHLY PAYMENT DATE TO OCCUR AFTER EACH  ONE-YEAR  ANNIVERSARY FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE CREDIT FACILITY. UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A MANAGER EVENT (DESCRIBED BELOW), THE CONSENT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO PAY OPERATING EXPENSES THROUGH THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS PROVISION.  EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  THE CREDIT  FACILITY CONTAINS CERTAIN NEGATIVE COVENANTS, CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT. THE CREDIT FACILITY DOES NOT CONTAIN GRACE PERIODS FOR BREACH BY THE COMPANY OF CERTAIN COVENANTS, INCLUDING,  WITHOUT LIMITATION, PRESERVATION OF EXISTENCE, NEGATIVE PLEDGE, CHANGE OF NAME OR JURISDICTION AND SEPARATE LEGAL ENTITY STATUS OF THE COMPANY COVENANTS AND CERTAIN  96  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER CUSTOMARY COVENANTS. OTHER EVENTS OF DEFAULT UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  AN INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO OF LESS THAN 150.0%;  \u2022  AN OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO OF LESS THAN 175.0%;  \u2022  THE FILING OF CERTAIN ERISA OR TAX LIENS;  \u2022  THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN \u201cMANAGER EVENTS\u201d SUCH AS.  \u2022  FAILURE BY SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND ITS AFFILIATES TO MAINTAIN COLLECTIVELY, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, A  CASH EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO AT LEAST $5.0 MILLION AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE;  \u2022  FAILURE OF THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND THE COMPANY TO BE IN FULL FORCE AND  EFFECT;  \u2022  INDICTMENT OR CONVICTION OF SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS OR ANY \u201cKEY PERSON\u201d FOR A FELONY OFFENSE, OR  ANY FRAUD, EMBEZZLEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF FUNDS BY SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS OR ANY \u201cKEY PERSON\u201d AND, IN THE CASE OF \u201cKEY PERSONS,\u201d WITHOUT A REPUTABLE, EXPERIENCED INDIVIDUAL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO MADISON CAPITAL  FUNDING APPOINTED TO REPLACE SUCH KEY PERSON WITHIN 30 DAYS;  \u2022  RESIGNATION, TERMINATION, DISABILITY OR DEATH OF A \u201cKEY PERSON\u201d OR FAILURE OF ANY \u201cKEY  PERSON\u201d TO PROVIDE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS\u2019 DAILY ACTIVITIES, ALL WITHOUT A REPUTABLE, EXPERIENCED INDIVIDUAL REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING APPOINTED WITHIN 30 DAYS; OR  \u2022  OCCURRENCE OF ANY EVENT CONSTITUTING \u201cCAUSE\u201d UNDER THE COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE  COMPANY AND SARATOGA CLO (THE \u201cCLO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT\u201d), DELIVERY OF A NOTICE UNDER SECTION 12(C) OF THE CLO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE REMOVAL OF THE COMPANY AS COLLATERAL MANAGER OR THE COMPANY CEASES TO ACT AS  COLLATERAL MANAGER UNDER THE CLO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  CONDITIONS TO ACQUISITIONS AND PLEDGES OF LOAN ASSETS.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IMPOSES CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS TO THE ACQUISITION AND PLEDGE OF ADDITIONAL LOAN ASSETS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE COMPANY MAY NOT ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL LOAN ASSETS WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT INDICATES IN WRITING ITS SATISFACTION WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS\u2019 POLICIES, PERSONNEL AND PROCESSES RELATING TO THE LOAN ASSETS.  FEES AND EXPENSES.  THE COMPANY PAID CERTAIN FEES AND REIMBURSED MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC FOR THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ALL DOCUMENTED,  OUT-OF-POCKET  COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING THE REASONABLE FEES AND EXPENSES OF LAWYERS, INCURRED BY MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC IN CONNECTION WITH THE CREDIT FACILITY  AND THE CARRYING OUT OF ANY AND ALL ACTS CONTEMPLATED THEREUNDER UP TO AND AS OF THE DATE OF CLOSING OF THE STOCK PURCHASE TRANSACTION WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES. THESE AMOUNTS TOTALED $2.0 MILLION.  ON FEBRUARY 24, 2012, WE AMENDED OUR SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  EXPAND THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FROM $40.0 MILLION TO $45.0 MILLION;  \u2022  EXTEND THE PERIOD DURING WHICH WE MAY MAKE AND REPAY BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FROM JULY 30, 2013  TO FEBRUARY 24, 2015 (THE \u201cREVOLVING PERIOD\u201d). THE REVOLVING PERIOD MAY, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, BY ACTION OF THE LENDERS OR AUTOMATICALLY, BE TERMINATED. ALL BORROWINGS AND OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER THE CREDIT  FACILITY ARE DUE AND PAYABLE FIVE YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD; AND  97  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  REMOVE THE CONDITION THAT WE MAY NOT ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL LOAN ASSETS WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE  ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.  ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2014, WE ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDMENT TO THE REVOLVING FACILITY WITH  MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  EXTEND THE COMMITMENT TERMINATION DATE FROM FEBRUARY 24, 2015 TO SEPTEMBER 17, 2017;  \u2022  EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE OF THE REVOLVING FACILITY FROM FEBRUARY 24, 2020 TO SEPTEMBER 17, 2022 (UNLESS  TERMINATED SOONER UPON CERTAIN EVENTS);  \u2022  REDUCE THE APPLICABLE MARGIN RATE ON BASE RATE BORROWINGS FROM 4.50% TO 3.75%, AND ON LIBOR BORROWINGS FROM 5.50%  TO 4.75%; AND  \u2022  REDUCE THE FLOOR ON BASE RATE BORROWINGS FROM 3.00% TO 2.25%; AND ON LIBOR BORROWINGS FROM 2.00% TO 1.25%.  ON MAY 18, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A THIRD AMENDMENT TO THE CREDIT FACILITY WITH MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC TO,  AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  EXTEND THE COMMITMENT TERMINATION DATE FROM SEPTEMBER 17, 2017 TO SEPTEMBER 17, 2020;  \u2022  EXTEND THE FINAL MATURITY DATE OF THE CREDIT FACILITY FROM SEPTEMBER 17, 2022 TO SEPTEMBER 17, 2025;  \u2022  REDUCE THE FLOOR ON BASE RATE BORROWINGS FROM 2.25% TO 2.00%;  \u2022  REDUCE THE FLOOR ON LIBOR BORROWINGS FROM 1.25% TO 1.00%; AND  \u2022  REDUCE THE COMMITMENT FEE RATE FROM 0.75% TO 0.50% FOR ANY PERIOD DURING WHICH THE RATIO OF ADVANCES OUTSTANDING  TO AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS, EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE, IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 50%.  AS OF MAY 31, 2019, WE HAD  $0.0 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND $150.0 MILLION OF  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES OUTSTANDING (WHICH ARE DISCUSSED BELOW). AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE HAD NO  OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND $150.0 MILLION OF  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES OUTSTANDING. OUR BORROWING BASE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AT MAY 31, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS $27.3 MILLION AND $30.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  OUR ASSET COVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN THE 1940 ACT, WAS 238.9% AS OF  MAY 31, 2019 AND 234.5% AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES  IN ADDITION, WE, THROUGH A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, SOUGHT AND OBTAINED A LICENSE FROM THE SBA TO OPERATE AN SBIC. IN THIS REGARD, ON  MARCH 28, 2012, OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, SARATOGA INVESTMENT CORP. SBIC, LP, RECEIVED A LICENSE FROM THE SBA TO OPERATE AS AN SBIC UNDER SECTION 301(C) OF THE SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT ACT OF 1958. SBICS ARE DESIGNATED TO STIMULATE THE  FLOW OF PRIVATE EQUITY CAPITAL TO ELIGIBLE SMALL BUSINESSES. UNDER SBA REGULATIONS, SBICS MAY MAKE LOANS TO ELIGIBLE SMALL BUSINESSES AND INVEST IN THE EQUITY SECURITIES OF SMALL BUSINESSES.  THE SBIC LICENSE ALLOWS OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY TO OBTAIN LEVERAGE BY ISSUING  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES.  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES ARE  NON-RECOURSE,  INTEREST ONLY DEBENTURES WITH INTEREST PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY AND HAVE A  TEN-YEAR  MATURITY.  THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE PAID PRIOR TO MATURITY  BUT MAY BE PREPAID AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PENALTY. THE INTEREST RATE OF  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES IS FIXED ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS AT A MARKET-DRIVEN SPREAD OVER U.S. TREASURY NOTES WITH  TEN-YEAR  MATURITIES.  98  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SBA REGULATIONS CURRENTLY LIMIT THE AMOUNT THAT OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY MAY BORROW TO A MAXIMUM  OF $150.0 MILLION WHEN IT HAS AT LEAST $75.0 MILLION IN REGULATORY CAPITAL, RECEIVES A CAPITAL COMMITMENT FROM THE SBA AND HAS BEEN THROUGH AN EXAMINATION BY THE SBA SUBSEQUENT TO LICENSING. AS OF MAY 31, 2019, OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY HAD  $75.0 MILLION IN REGULATORY CAPITAL AND $150.0 MILLION  SBA-  GUARANTEED DEBENTURES OUTSTANDING.  WE RECEIVED EXEMPTIVE RELIEF FROM THE SEC TO PERMIT US TO EXCLUDE THE DEBT OF OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEED BY THE SBA FROM THE DEFINITION OF  SENIOR SECURITIES IN THE ASSET COVERAGE TEST UNDER THE 1940 ACT. THIS ALLOWS US INCREASED FLEXIBILITY UNDER THE ASSET COVERAGE TEST BY PERMITTING US TO BORROW UP TO $150.0 MILLION MORE THAN WE WOULD OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO ABSENT THE RECEIPT OF  THIS EXEMPTIVE RELIEF. ON APRIL 16, 2018, AS PERMITTED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT AVAILABILITY ACT, WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON MARCH 23, 2018, OUR  NON-  INTERESTED BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED OF  OUR BECOMING SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM ASSET COVERAGE RATIO OF 150.0% FROM 200% UNDER SECTIONS 18(A)(1) AND 18(A)(2) OF THE 1940 ACT. THE 150.0% ASSET COVERAGE RATIO BECAME EFFECTIVE ON APRIL 16, 2019.  ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2018, THE SBA ISSUED A \u201cGREEN LIGHT\u201d LETTER INVITING US TO FILE A FORMAL LICENSE APPLICATION FOR A SECOND SBIC  LICENSE. IF APPROVED, THE ADDITIONAL SBIC LICENSE WOULD PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH AN INCREMENTAL SOURCE OF LONG-TERM CAPITAL BY PERMITTING US TO ISSUE, SUBJECT TO SBA APPROVAL, UP TO $175.0 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES IN ADDITION TO THE $150.0 MILLION ALREADY APPROVED UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S FIRST LICENSE. RECEIPT OF A GREEN LIGHT LETTER FROM THE SBA DOES NOT ASSURE AN APPLICANT THAT THE SBA  WILL ULTIMATELY ISSUE AN SBIC LICENSE AND THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED NO ASSURANCE OR INDICATION FROM THE SBA THAT IT WILL RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL SBIC LICENSE, OR OF THE TIMEFRAME IN WHICH IT WOULD RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL LICENSE, SHOULD ONE ULTIMATELY BE  GRANTED.  UNSECURED NOTES  IN  MAY 2013, WE ISSUED $48.3 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR 2020 NOTES FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $46.1 MILLION AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING COMMISSIONS OF $1.9 MILLION AND OFFERING COSTS OF $0.3 MILLION. THE PROCEEDS  INCLUDED THE UNDERWRITERS\u2019 FULL EXERCISE OF THEIR OVERALLOTMENT OPTION. INTEREST ON THESE 2020 NOTES IS PAID QUARTERLY IN ARREARS ON FEBRUARY 15, MAY 15, AUGUST 15 AND NOVEMBER 15, AT A RATE OF 7.50% PER YEAR, BEGINNING  AUGUST 15, 2013. THE 2020 NOTES MATURE ON MAY 31, 2020 AND SINCE MAY 31, 2016, MAY BE REDEEMED IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT ANY TIME OR FROM TIME TO TIME AT OUR OPTION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2020 NOTES, WE AGREED TO THE  FOLLOWING COVENANTS FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME DURING WHICH THE 2020 NOTES ARE OUTSTANDING.  \u2022  WE WILL NOT VIOLATE (WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE SUBJECT TO) SECTION 18(A)(1)(A) AS MODIFIED BY  SECTION 61(A)(1) OF THE 1940 ACT OR ANY SUCCESSOR PROVISIONS, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY EXEMPTIVE RELIEF GRANTED TO US BY THE SEC. CURRENTLY, THESE PROVISIONS GENERALLY PROHIBIT US FROM MAKING ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE  ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL DEBT OR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL DEBT SECURITIES, UNLESS OUR ASSET COVERAGE, AS DEFINED IN THE 1940 ACT, EQUALS AT LEAST 200.0% AFTER SUCH BORROWINGS.  \u2022  WE WILL NOT VIOLATE (REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE ARE SUBJECT TO) SECTION 18(A)(1)(B) AS MODIFIED BY  SECTION 61(A)(1) OF THE 1940 ACT OR ANY SUCCESSOR PROVISIONS, BUT GIVING EFFECT TO (I) ANY EXEMPTIVE RELIEF GRANTED TO US BY THE SEC AND  (II) NO-ACTION  RELIEF GRANTED BY THE SEC TO ANOTHER BDC  (OR TO THE COMPANY IF IT DETERMINES TO SEEK SUCH SIMILAR  NO-ACTION  OR OTHER RELIEF) PERMITTING THE BDC TO DECLARE ANY CASH DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROHIBITION CONTAINED IN  SECTION 18(A) (1)(B) AS MODIFIED BY SECTION 61(A)(1) OF THE 1940 ACT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE BDC\u2019S STATUS AS A REGULATED INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE CODE. CURRENTLY THESE PROVISIONS GENERALLY PROHIBIT US FROM DECLARING ANY CASH  DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION UPON ANY CLASS OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK, OR PURCHASING ANY SUCH CAPITAL STOCK IF OUR ASSET COVERAGE, AS DEFINED IN THE 1940 ACT, IS BELOW 200.0% AT THE TIME OF THE DECLARATION OF THE DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION OR THE PURCHASE AND  AFTER DEDUCTING THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DIVIDEND, DISTRIBUTION OR PURCHASE.  THE 2020 NOTES WERE REDEEMED IN FULL ON  JANUARY 13, 2017 AND ARE NO LONGER LISTED ON THE NYSE.  99  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON MAY 29, 2015, WE ENTERED INTO A DEBT DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH LADENBURG  THALMANN & CO.

PRIOR TO THE 2020 NOTES BEING REDEEMED IN FULL, THE COMPANY HAD SOLD  539,725 BONDS WITH A PRINCIPAL OF $13.5 MILLION AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $25.31 FOR AGGREGATE NET PROCEEDS OF $13.4 MILLION (NET OF TRANSACTION COSTS).

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS OPERATIONS AS TWO OPERATING SEGMENTS: NORTH AMERICAN RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL SALES. THE INSTITUTIONAL SALES OPERATING SEGMENT, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF LINEN HOLDINGS, DOES NOT MEET THE QUANTITATIVE THRESHOLDS UNDER U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THEREFORE IS NOT A REPORTABLE SEGMENT.  THE COMPANY'S MISSION IS TO BE TRUSTED BY ITS CUSTOMERS AS THE EXPERT FOR THE HOME AND HEART-FELT LIFE EVENTS. THESE INCLUDE CERTAIN LIFE EVENTS THAT EVOKE STRONG EMOTIONAL CONNECTIONS SUCH AS GETTING MARRIED, MOVING TO A NEW HOME, HAVING A BABY, GOING TO COLLEGE AND DECORATING A ROOM, WHICH THE COMPANY SUPPORTS THROUGH ITS WEDDING AND BABY REGISTRIES, MOVER AND STUDENT LIFE PROGRAMS, AND DESIGN CONSULTATION SERVICES.

THESE CAPABILITIES ALLOW THE COMPANY TO BETTER SERVE CUSTOMERS ACROSS VARIOUS CHANNELS.  OPERATING IN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE RETAIL INDUSTRY, THE COMPANY, ALONG WITH OTHER RETAIL COMPANIES, IS INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDING THE HOUSING MARKET, UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND COMMODITY PRICES; THE OVERALL MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND RELATED CHANGES IN THE RETAILING ENVIRONMENT; CONSUMER PREFERENCES, SPENDING HABITS AND ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES; UNUSUAL WEATHER PATTERNS AND NATURAL DISASTERS; COMPETITION FROM EXISTING AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS ACROSS ALL CHANNELS; POTENTIAL SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION; THE ABILITY TO FIND SUITABLE LOCATIONS AT ACCEPTABLE OCCUPANCY COSTS AND OTHER TERMS TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S PLANS FOR NEW STORES; AND THE ABILITY TO ASSESS AND IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGIES IN SUPPORT OF THE COMPANY'S DEVELOPMENT OF ITS OMNICHANNEL CAPABILITIES.

SALES OF DOMESTICS MERCHANDISE AND HOME FURNISHINGS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY  35.6%  AND  64.4%  OF NET SALES, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  , AND APPROXIMATELY  36.0%  AND  64.0%  OF NET SALES, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018.  GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  $887.2 MILLION  , OR  34.5%  OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH  $964.8 MILLION  , OR  35.0%  OF NET SALES, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  . IN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE, THE DECREASE IN THE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO A DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN COUPON EXPENSE AND NET DIRECT-TO-CUSTOMER SHIPPING EXPENSE. THE DECREASE IN COUPON EXPENSE WAS THE RESULT OF A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF REDEMPTIONS WITH FEWER PIECES DISTRIBUTED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COUPON AMOUNT.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS INVESTING IN THE LIFETIME VALUE OF ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS ANNUAL BEYOND PLUS MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM.  THE RICHER BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM, INCLUDING TWENTY PERCENT OFF ENTIRE PURCHASE AND FREE SHIPPING, ARE REALIZED IMMEDIATELY UPON SALE AND HAD, AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE, AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S GROSS MARGIN DURING THE PERIOD OF INCREASING ENROLLMENT.  THE BEYOND PLUS MEMBERSHIP FEE IS AMORTIZED OVER THE ONE-YEAR MEMBERSHIP PERIOD.  THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THAT THE IMPACT OF THESE PROGRAMS REDUCED GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES BY APPROXIMATELY 60 BASIS POINTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND APPROXIMATELY 40 BASIS POINTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SG&A FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  $892.8 MILLION  , OR  34.7%  OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH  $883.6 MILLION  , OR  32.1%  OF NET SALES, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  . THE INCREASE IN SG&A, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO, IN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE: INCREASES IN PAYROLL AND PAYROLL-RELATED EXPENSES (PRIMARILY DUE TO SEVERANCE), TECHNOLOGY-RELATED EXPENSES, INCLUDING DEPRECIATION, AND SHAREHOLDER ACTIVITY COSTS.  GOODWILL AND OTHER IMPAIRMENTS  GOODWILL AND OTHER IMPAIRMENTS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  $401.3 MILLION  , OR  15.6%  OF NET SALES.  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS WERE $391.1 MILLION AND TRADENAME IMPAIRMENTS WERE $10.2 MILLION.  THE NON-CASH PRE-TAX GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A SUSTAINED DECLINE IN THE COMPANY'S MARKET CAPITALIZATION.  THERE WERE NO GOODWILL OR OTHER IMPAIRMENTS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018.  OPERATING (LOSS) PROFIT  OPERATING LOSS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  $406.8 MILLION  , OR  15.8%  OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH OPERATING PROFIT OF  $81.2 MILLION  , OR  2.9%  OF NET SALES, DURING THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE CHANGES IN OPERATING PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WERE THE RESULT OF THE REDUCTIONS IN GROSS PROFIT MARGIN AND THE INCREASES IN SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES AND GOODWILL AND OTHER IMPAIRMENTS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  $15.9 MILLION  , COMPARED WITH  $16.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  .  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  AND  JUNE 2, 2018  , INTEREST EXPENSE, NET PRIMARILY RELATED TO INTEREST ON THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY IN JULY 2014.  INCOME TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  12.2%  , COMPARED WITH  32.4%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  . FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF CHARGES FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER IMPAIRMENTS AND SEVERANCE COSTS, PORTIONS OF WHICH ARE NON-DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE TAX RATES ALSO INCLUDED OTHER DISCRETE TAX ITEMS RESULTING IN NET AFTER TAX COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $12.5  MILLION AND  $3.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  AND  JUNE 2, 2018  , DUE TO DISCRETE FEDERAL AND STATE TAX ITEMS OCCURRING DURING THESE QUARTERS.  -22-  POTENTIAL VOLATILITY IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM YEAR TO YEAR MAY OCCUR AS THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED EACH YEAR TO DETERMINE WHETHER NEW INFORMATION CHANGES THE ASSESSMENT OF BOTH THE PROBABILITY THAT A TAX POSITION WILL EFFECTIVELY BE SUSTAINED AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE AMOUNT OF RECOGNIZED BENEFIT.  NET (LOSS) EARNINGS  AS A RESULT OF THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, NET LOSS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WERE  $371.1 MILLION  , COMPARED WITH NET EARNINGS OF  $43.6 MILLION  FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018.

AS OF  JUNE 1, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY  $922.7 MILLION  IN CASH AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  $75.8 MILLION  COMPARED WITH THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  . FOR FISCAL  2019  , THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT CAN CONTINUE TO FINANCE ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ITS GROWTH, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS, CASH DIVIDENDS, AND SHARE REPURCHASES, THROUGH EXISTING AND INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS. IN ADDITION, IF NECESSARY, THE COMPANY COULD BORROW UNDER ITS $250 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OR THE AVAILABLE BALANCES UNDER ITS LINES OF CREDIT. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL  2019  ARE PLANNED TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $350 MILLION  TO  $375 MILLION  , ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO EVALUATE ITS CAPITAL PROJECTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS ALTERNATIVES WITH RESPECT TO ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER INCLUDES 13 WEEKS IN CERTAIN FISCAL YEARS TO ADJUST FOR OUR STANDARD 52 WEEK, OR 364 DAY, FISCAL YEAR COMPARED TO THE 365 DAY CALENDAR YEAR. COMPARABILITY BETWEEN QUARTERS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE VARYING LENGTHS OF THE QUARTERS, AS WELL AS THE SEASONALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS.  SAME-STORE SALES  THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT TO FOOD QUALITY, CONCEPT, LOCATION, PRICE, AND SERVICE, ALL OF WHICH MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON SAME-STORE SALES. OUR SAME-STORE SALES CALCULATION MEASURES THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF A CERTAIN GROUP OF RESTAURANTS. A RESTAURANT\u2019S SALES RESULTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE SAME-STORE SALES CALCULATION IN THE QUARTER AFTER A STORE HAS BEEN OPEN FOR SIX CONSECUTIVE FISCAL QUARTERS. STORES THAT CLOSE ON A PERMANENT BASIS (OR ON A TEMPORARY BASIS FOR REMODELING) ARE REMOVED FROM THE GROUP IN THE QUARTER WHEN OPERATIONS CEASE AT THE RESTAURANT, BUT REMAIN IN THE SAME-STORE GROUP FOR PREVIOUSLY REPORTED QUARTERS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS APPROACH LEADS TO MORE EFFECTIVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISONS, NEITHER THE TIME FRAME NOR THE EXACT PRACTICE MAY BE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY OTHER RESTAURANT COMPANIES.  33  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  QUARTER ENDED  JUNE 5, 2019  COMPARED TO QUARTER ENDED  JUNE 6, 2018  COMPARABILITY BETWEEN QUARTERS IS AFFECTED BY THE VARYING LENGTHS OF THE QUARTERS AND QUARTERS ENDING AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN THE CALENDAR YEAR WHEN SEASONAL PATTERNS FOR SALES ARE DIFFERENT.

OVERVIEW  DOMINO\u2019S IS THE LARGEST PIZZA COMPANY IN THE WORLD BASED ON GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WITH MORE THAN 16,300 LOCATIONS IN OVER 85 MARKETS. FOUNDED IN 1960, OUR ROOTS ARE IN CONVENIENT PIZZA DELIVERY, WHILE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SALES ALSO COME FROM CARRYOUT CUSTOMERS. DOMINO\u2019S GENERATES REVENUES AND EARNINGS BY CHARGING ROYALTIES AND FEES TO OUR INDEPENDENT FRANCHISEES. THE COMPANY ALSO GENERATES REVENUES AND EARNINGS BY SELLING FOOD, EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO FRANCHISEES PRIMARILY IN THE U.S. AND CANADA, AND BY OPERATING A NUMBER OF OUR OWN STORES IN THE U.S. FRANCHISEES PROFIT BY SELLING PIZZA AND OTHER COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS TO THEIR LOCAL CUSTOMERS. IN OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE GENERALLY GRANT GEOGRAPHICAL RIGHTS TO THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA  \u00ae  BRAND TO MASTER FRANCHISEES. THESE MASTER FRANCHISEES ARE CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL AREA, AND THEY CAN PROFIT BY  SUB-FRANCHISING  AND SELLING INGREDIENTS AND EQUIPMENT TO THOSE  SUB-FRANCHISEES,  AS WELL AS BY RUNNING PIZZA STORES DIRECTLY. EVERYONE IN THE SYSTEM CAN BENEFIT, INCLUDING THE END CONSUMER, WHO CAN FEED THEIR FAMILY DOMINO\u2019S MENU ITEMS CONVENIENTLY AND ECONOMICALLY.  OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE DRIVEN LARGELY BY RETAIL SALES AT OUR FRANCHISE AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES. CHANGES IN RETAIL SALES ARE DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN SAME STORE SALES AND STORE COUNTS. WE MONITOR BOTH OF THESE METRICS VERY CLOSELY, AS THEY DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS, AND WE STRIVE TO CONSISTENTLY INCREASE BOTH METRICS. RETAIL SALES DRIVE ROYALTY PAYMENTS FROM FRANCHISEES, AS WELL AS COMPANY-OWNED STORE AND SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES. RETAIL SALES ARE PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA  \u00ae  BRAND, THE RESULTS OF OUR EXTENSIVE ADVERTISING THROUGH VARIOUS MEDIA CHANNELS, THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND DIGITAL ORDERING, OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR STRONG AND PROVEN BUSINESS MODEL AND THE OVERALL GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

THE SAME STORE SALES GROWTH FOR THESE STORES IS REFLECTED IN U.S. FRANCHISE STORES IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WE EXPERIENCED GLOBAL RETAIL SALES GROWTH. OUR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH REMAINED POSITIVE BUT WAS PRESSURED BY OUR CURRENT STRATEGY TO INCREASE STORE CONCENTRATION IN CERTAIN MARKETS WHERE WE COMPETE.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ALSO CONTINUED OUR GLOBAL EXPANSION WITH THE OPENING OF 200 NET NEW STORES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, BRINGING OUR  YEAR-TO-DATE  TOTAL TO 400. WE OPENED 158 NET NEW STORES INTERNATIONALLY AND 42 NET NEW STORES IN THE U.S. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. OVERALL, WE BELIEVE THIS GLOBAL STORE GROWTH, ALONG WITH OUR STRONG SALES, EMPHASIS ON TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONS, AND MARKETING INITIATIVES, HAVE COMBINED TO STRENGTHEN OUR BRAND.  GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WHICH ARE TOTAL WORLDWIDE RETAIL SALES AT FRANCHISE AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES, INCREASED 5.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 4.8% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN WORLDWIDE STORE COUNTS DURING THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS AS WELL AS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES PARTIALLY OFFSET THIS INCREASE, RESULTING FROM A GENERALLY STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR WHEN COMPARED TO THE CURRENCIES IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. U.S. SAME STORE SALES GROWTH REFLECTED THE SUSTAINED POSITIVE SALES TRENDS AND THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS, MARKETING AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH ALSO REFLECTED CONTINUED POSITIVE PERFORMANCE.  TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED $32.2 MILLION, OR 4.1%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $82.8 MILLION, OR 5.3%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN AND GLOBAL FRANCHISE REVENUES. THE INCREASES IN INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE ALSO PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORE REVENUES RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF 59 COMPANY-OWNED STORES TO CERTAIN OF OUR EXISTING U.S. FRANCHISEES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 (THE \u201cSECOND QUARTER STORE SALE\u201d). THESE CHANGES IN REVENUES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $12.8 MILLION, OR 10.1%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $22.8 MILLION, OR 8.8%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER ROYALTY REVENUES FROM U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISED STORES, AS WELL AS HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN MARGINS. HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND OTHER AREAS AND A $2.4 MILLION  PRE-TAX  LOSS RELATED TO THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE INCREASES. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  NET INCOME INCREASED $15.0 MILLION, OR 19.3%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $18.8 MILLION, OR 11.3%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, DRIVEN BY HIGHER INCOME FROM OPERATIONS AND LOWER TAX EXPENSE RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM HIGHER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION. NET INCOME FURTHER BENEFITED FROM LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 RESULTING FROM $3.3 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL INTEREST EXPENSE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH OUR RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTION COMPLETED ON APRIL 24, 2018 (THE \u201c2018 RECAPITALIZATION\u201d). THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM A HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE AND A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE FOLLOWING THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION.

THESE DECREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. COMPANY-OWNED SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 2.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.6% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

U.S. FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 3.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 3.5% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER VOLUMES FROM INCREASED ORDERS RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF U.S. FRANCHISE STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD AND AN INCREASE IN MARKET BASKET PRICING. OUR MARKET BASKET PRICING TO STORES INCREASED 2.3% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.0% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WHICH RESULTED IN AN ESTIMATED INCREASE IN U.S. SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES OF $5.6 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND $11.8 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN  REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS INCREASED $1.8 MILLION, OR 4.4%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $4.0 MILLION, OR 4.9%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER VOLUMES FROM INCREASED ORDERS AND AN INCREASE IN MARKET BASKET PRICING. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OF $1.7 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND $3.8 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEE REVENUES  REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEES INCREASED $3.7 MILLION, OR 7.1%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $5.8 MILLION, OR 5.6%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD AND HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OF $3.0 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND $6.6 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 2.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.1% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 4.0% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND INCREASED 4.4% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COST OF SALES / OPERATING MARGIN  SECOND QUARTER  SECOND QUARTER  TWO FISCAL  TWO FISCAL  OF 2019  OF 2018  QUARTERS OF 2019  QUARTERS OF 2018  CONSOLIDATED REVENUES  $811.6  100.0%  $779.4  100.0%  $1,647.6  100.0%  $1,564.8  100.0%  CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES  495.0  61.0%  485.8  62.3%  1,008.7  61.2%  971.3  62.1%  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN  $316.7  39.0%  $293.6  37.7%  $639.0  38.8%  $593.4  37.9%  COST OF SALES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF COMPANY-OWNED STORE AND SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS INCURRED TO GENERATE RELATED REVENUES. COMPONENTS OF CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES PRIMARILY INCLUDE FOOD, LABOR, DELIVERY AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN (WHICH WE DEFINE AS REVENUES LESS COST OF SALES) INCREASED $23.1 MILLION, OR 7.9%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $45.6 MILLION, OR 7.7%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GLOBAL FRANCHISE REVENUES AND HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN VOLUMES. FRANCHISE REVENUES DO NOT HAVE A COST OF SALES COMPONENT, SO CHANGES IN THESE REVENUES HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE OPERATING MARGIN.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES, THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 1.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. COMPANY-OWNED STORE OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

OPERATING MARGIN IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY HIGHER LABOR COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. AS A PERCENTAGE OF STORE REVENUES, THE STORE OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE CHANGES IN OPERATING MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  \u2022  FOOD COSTS DECREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 26.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND DECREASED 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 27.0% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE LEVERAGING OF HIGHER SAME STORE SALES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN EFFICIENCY. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FOOD PRICES.  \u2022  LABOR COSTS DECREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 29.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 30.2% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCTION IN LABOR COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF STORE REVENUES IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE TO THE HIGH LABOR RATES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE SOLD STORES OPERATED. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND FULLY OFFSET IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE LABOR RATES IN OUR REMAINING COMPANY-OWNED STORE MARKETS.

AS A PERCENTAGE OF SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES, THE SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO PROCUREMENT SAVINGS AND LOWER INSURANCE EXPENSE, OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER LABOR COSTS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED $2.7 MILLION, OR 3.2%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $8.2 MILLION, OR 4.8%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND OTHER AREAS. A $2.4 MILLION  PRE-TAX  LOSS RELATED TO THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASES.  U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING EXPENSES  U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING EXPENSES INCREASED $7.6 MILLION, OR 9.4%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $14.5 MILLION, OR 8.9%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE TO HIGHER U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING REVENUES. U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING COSTS ARE ACCRUED AND EXPENSED WHEN THE RELATED U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED, AS OUR CONSOLIDATED  NOT-FOR-PROFIT  ADVERTISING FUND IS OBLIGATED TO EXPEND SUCH REVENUES ON ADVERTISING AND THESE REVENUES CANNOT BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET DECREASED $2.0 MILLION, OR 5.7%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $2.5 MILLION, OR 3.9%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE, NET IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 RESULTED FROM $3.3 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL INTEREST EXPENSE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND MORE THAN OFFSET IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 BY A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER AVERAGE BORROWINGS RESULTING FROM THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION AND OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES. A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  THE COMPANY\u2019S WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE INCREASED TO 4.1% IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, FROM 4.0% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND 3.9% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018, RESULTING FROM THE HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON THE DEBT OUTSTANDING IN 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES DECREASED $0.2 MILLION, OR 1.2%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $1.5 MILLION, OR 5.2%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. HIGHER  PRE-TAX  INCOME CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER TAX EXPENSE IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, BUT THESE INCREASES WERE FULLY OFFSET IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND PARTIALLY OFFSET IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 BY HIGHER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED TO 12.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND DECREASED TO 14.0% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 15.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND 14.7% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE OPERATED WITH MINIMAL POSITIVE WORKING CAPITAL OR NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OUR RECEIVABLE COLLECTION PERIODS AND INVENTORY TURN RATES ARE FASTER THAN THE NORMAL PAYMENT TERMS ON OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES. WE GENERALLY COLLECT OUR RECEIVABLES WITHIN THREE WEEKS FROM THE DATE OF THE RELATED SALE, AND WE GENERALLY EXPERIENCE 35 TO 45 INVENTORY TURNS PER YEAR. IN ADDITION, OUR SALES ARE NOT TYPICALLY SEASONAL, WHICH FURTHER LIMITS OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE USE OF OUR ONGOING CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO SERVICE OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK REDUCES OUR WORKING CAPITAL AMOUNTS. AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL OF $73.5 MILLION, EXCLUDING RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $152.7 MILLION, ADVERTISING FUND ASSETS, RESTRICTED, OF $117.7 MILLION AND ADVERTISING FUND LIABILITIES OF $113.4 MILLION. WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDES TOTAL UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $108.3 MILLION.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, OUR INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. BUSINESSES GREW STORE COUNTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE OUR UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, EXCESS CASH FROM OUR RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTIONS AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INVEST IN OUR CORE BUSINESS, SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL COMMITMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS OF JUNE 16, 2019.  BASED UPON OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF OPERATIONS AND ANTICIPATED GROWTH, WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, OUR CURRENT UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTE FACILITY WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO FUND THESE ITEMS AND CONTINUE TO REDUCE DEBT COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE EVENTS DESCRIBED UNDER \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OR THAT FUTURE BORROWINGS WILL BE AVAILABLE UNDER THE VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES OR OTHERWISE TO ENABLE US TO SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS OR TO MAKE ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OUR FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE, EXTEND OR REFINANCE OUR FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES AND TO SERVICE, EXTEND OR REFINANCE OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES WILL BE SUBJECT TO FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TO FINANCIAL, BUSINESS AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESTRICTED CASH  AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $115.9 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH HELD FOR FUTURE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS AND OTHER WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF OUR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATION STRUCTURE, $36.6 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH HELD IN A THREE-MONTH INTEREST RESERVE AS REQUIRED BY THE RELATED DEBT AGREEMENTS AND $0.2 MILLION OF OTHER RESTRICTED CASH FOR A TOTAL OF $152.7 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE ALSO HELD $61.3 MILLION OF ADVERTISING FUND RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, WHICH CAN ONLY BE USED FOR ACTIVITIES THAT PROMOTE THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA BRAND.  LONG-TERM DEBT  AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $3.45 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, OF WHICH $35.9 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY. OUR FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES FROM THE RECAPITALIZATIONS WE COMPLETED IN 2018, 2017 AND 2015 HAVE ORIGINAL SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF $17.6 MILLION IN THE REMAINDER OF 2019, $35.3 MILLION IN EACH OF 2020 AND 2021, $888.0 MILLION IN 2022, $26.3 MILLION IN EACH OF 2023 AND 2024, $1.14 BILLION IN 2025, $14.0 MILLION IN 2026 AND $1.27 BILLION IN 2027. AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND $126.9 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING, NET OF LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED OF $48.1 MILLION. THE LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR CASUALTY INSURANCE PROGRAMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN CENTER LEASES. BORROWINGS UNDER THE VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES ARE AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND, SUBJECT TO OTHER LIMITATIONS, OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS  OUR OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN FUNDED BY EXCESS CASH FLOWS. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO $750.0 MILLION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 12,295 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $3.3 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $269.14 PER SHARE. DURING THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 45,844 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $11.5 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $249.82 PER SHARE. AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD A TOTAL REMAINING AUTHORIZED AMOUNT FOR SHARE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY $147.3 MILLION.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 905,556 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $219.0 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $241.82 PER SHARE. DURING THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 1,353,564 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $320.1 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $236.46 PER SHARE.  DIVIDENDS  ON MARCH 29, 2019, THE COMPANY PAID A $0.65 DIVIDEND TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF MARCH 15, 2019. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, ON APRIL 23, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A $0.65 PER SHARE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON ITS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF JUNE 14, 2019, WHICH WAS PAID ON JUNE 28, 2019.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE SECOND QUARTER, ON JULY 10, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A $0.65 PER SHARE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON ITS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF SEPTEMBER 13, 2019 TO BE PAID ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.

THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DURING 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 AND WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN ADVERTISING FUND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, RESTRICTED IN 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $2.5 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WHICH CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF $25.7 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND SUPPLY CHAIN CENTERS). THIS USE OF CASH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MATURITIES OF ADVERTISING FUND INVESTMENTS, RESTRICTED OF $15.2 MILLION AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS OF $8.2 MILLION, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $43.8 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018, WHICH CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF $37.3 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES, SUPPLY CHAIN CENTERS AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES) AND PURCHASES OF RESTRICTED ADVERTISING FUND INVESTMENTS OF $35.2 MILLION. THESE USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MATURITIES OF RESTRICTED ADVERTISING FUND INVESTMENTS OF $29.0 MILLION.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $114.3 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, PRIMARILY RELATED TO REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $82.9 MILLION (OF WHICH $65.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES), DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS OF $26.7 MILLION, PURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK OF $11.5 MILLION UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND TAX PAYMENTS FOR RESTRICTED STOCK UPON VESTING OF $2.6 MILLION. THESE USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS OF $9.3 MILLION.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $30.1 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018.

SEE PART I\u2014ITEM 1A OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018  AND PART II\u2014ITEM 1A OF THE COMPANY\u2019S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING REASONS THAT ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS, DEVELOPMENTS AND BUSINESS DECISIONS CONTEMPLATED BY OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THE REPORT, DOCUMENT, PRESS RELEASE, WEBCAST, CALL, MATERIALS OR OTHER COMMUNICATION IN WHICH THEY ARE MADE.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LAW, WE DO NOT ASSUME ANY OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR REVISE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS OR OTHERWISE.  OVERVIEW  GENERAL  AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S GEOGRAPHIC AND INDUSTRY DIVERSITY, THE COMPANY FACES A VARIETY OF OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES, INCLUDING RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT (PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO COMPUTING, AUTOMATION, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, MOBILE CONNECTIVITY, COMMUNICATIONS AND DIGITIZATION) IN MOST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SERVED MARKETS, THE EXPANSION AND EVOLUTION OF OPPORTUNITIES IN HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS, TRENDS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A GLOBAL LABOR FORCE, CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMPETITORS AND INCREASING REGULATION.  THE COMPANY OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN MOST MARKETS, AND THE COMPANY\u2019S LONG-TERM GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY WILL DEPEND IN PARTICULAR ON ITS ABILITY TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS IN HIGH-GROWTH GEOGRAPHIES AND HIGH-GROWTH MARKET SEGMENTS, IDENTIFY, CONSUMMATE AND INTEGRATE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITIONS, DEVELOP INNOVATIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH HIGHER GROSS PROFIT MARGINS, EXPAND AND IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES FORCE, CONTINUE TO REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE OPERATING EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY, AND EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE DEMANDS OF AN INCREASINGLY REGULATED ENVIRONMENT.  THE COMPANY IS MAKING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS, ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, TO ADDRESS THE RAPID PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN ITS SERVED MARKETS AND TO GLOBALIZE ITS MANUFACTURING, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND CUSTOMER-FACING RESOURCES (PARTICULARLY IN HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS) IN ORDER TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS.  BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND OUTLOOK  DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF  2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES INCREASED  3.5%  COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  .  WHILE DIFFERENCES EXIST AMONG THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESSES, ON AN OVERALL BASIS, DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCREASED DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF  2019  COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  .  THIS DEMAND, TOGETHER WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN SALES GROWTH INITIATIVES AND THE OTHER BUSINESS-SPECIFIC FACTORS DISCUSSED BELOW, CONTRIBUTED TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR CORE SALES GROWTH OF  5.5%  (FOR THE DEFINITION OF \u201cCORE SALES\u201d OR \u201cCORE REVENUE\u201d REFER TO \u201c\u2014RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d BELOW).  GEOGRAPHICALLY, BOTH HIGH-GROWTH AND DEVELOPED MARKETS CONTRIBUTED TO CORE SALES GROWTH DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF  2019  .  CORE REVENUES IN HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS INCREASED AT A HIGH-SINGLE DIGIT RATE DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  LED PRIMARILY BY CONTINUED STRENGTH IN CHINA.  HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  31%  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TOTAL SALES IN THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF  2019  .  CORE REVENUES IN DEVELOPED MARKETS INCREASED AT A MID-SINGLE DIGIT RATE DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF  2019  LED PRIMARILY BY GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE.  FOR THE  SIX  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  , SALES INCREASED BY A TOTAL OF  3.5%  , WITH  5.5%  ATTRIBUTABLE TO CORE SALES GROWTH, AS A RESULT OF THE SAME FACTORS WHICH DROVE SALES GROWTH FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF  2019  .  THE COMPANY EXPECTS OVERALL YEAR-OVER-YEAR SALES GROWTH FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019  BUT REMAINS CAUTIOUS ABOUT CHALLENGES DUE TO MACRO-ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING GLOBAL UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO TRADE, TARIFFS, MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES BY GEOGRAPHICAL REGION DURING THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  AND  JUNE 29, 2018  , REFER TO NOTE  2  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S NET EARNINGS FOR THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  TOTALED  $731 MILLION  OR  $0.97  PER DILUTED SHARE AND APPROXIMATELY  $1.1 BILLION  OR  $1.43  PER DILUTED SHARE, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO  $674 MILLION  OR  $0.95  PER DILUTED SHARE AND APPROXIMATELY  $1.2 BILLION  OR  $1.75  PER DILUTED SHARE, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2018  .  REFER TO \u201c\u2014RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE DRIVERS IN THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR BOTH THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  .  THE TAX-RELATED CHARGES DISCUSSED BELOW IN \u201c\u2014RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u2014INCOME TAXES\u201d ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR  DECREASE  IN NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  SIX  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019.  ACQUISITIONS AND PROPOSED ENVISTA INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING  THE COMPANY\u2019S GROWTH STRATEGY CONTEMPLATES FUTURE ACQUISITIONS.  OPERATIONS AND RESULTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE RATE AND EXTENT TO WHICH APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVAILABLE AND SUCCESSFULLY CONSUMMATED, ACQUIRED BUSINESSES ARE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATED AND ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES OR COST SAVINGS ARE ACHIEVED.  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PENDING ACQUISITION OF THE BIOPHARMA BUSINESS OF GE LIFE SCIENCES AND THE ANTICIPATED FINANCING THEREOF, REFER TO NOTE 3 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ANTICIPATED ENVISTA INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING, REFER TO NOTE 4 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  DURING THE  SIX  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  THE COMPANY ACQUIRED  THREE  BUSINESSES FOR TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF  $327 MILLION  IN CASH, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED.  THE BUSINESSES ACQUIRED COMPLEMENT EXISTING UNITS OF THE LIFE SCIENCES SEGMENT.  THE AGGREGATE ANNUAL SALES OF THESE  BUSINESSES AT THE TIME OF THEIR ACQUISITION, BASED ON THE COMPANIES\u2019 REVENUES FOR THEIR LAST  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMPLETED FISCAL YEAR PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION, WERE  $68 MILLION.  THE COMPANY PRELIMINARILY RECORDED AN AGGREGATE OF  $210 MILLION  OF GOODWILL RELATED TO THESE ACQUISITIONS.  CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES  ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES  NEGATIVELY  IMPACTED REPORTED SALES BY APPROXIMATELY  3.0%  AND  3.5%  FOR THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MOST MAJOR CURRENCIES IN THE FIRST HALF OF  2019  .  IF THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AS OF  JUNE 28, 2019  WERE TO PREVAIL THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF  2019  , CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES WOULD REDUCE THE COMPANY\u2019S ESTIMATED FULL YEAR  2019  SALES BY APPROXIMATELY 1.5% ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS.  ANY FUTURE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR CURRENCIES WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR, AND ANY WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR CURRENCIES WOULD POSITIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR.  UK\u2019S REFERENDUM DECISION TO EXIT THE EU (\u201cBREXIT\u201d)  IN A REFERENDUM ON JUNE 23, 2016, VOTERS APPROVED FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM (\u201cUK\u201d) TO EXIT THE EU.  THE TIMING OF THE UK\u2019S EXIT FROM THE EU REMAINS UNCERTAIN; THE EU HAS EXTENDED THE DEADLINE FOR THE UK TO EXIT THE EU UNTIL OCTOBER 31, 2019.  WITH THE TERMS OF THE UK\u2019S WITHDRAWAL AND THE NATURE OF ITS FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EU STILL BEING DECIDED, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE STATUS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS AND PLAN FOR POTENTIAL IMPACTS.  TO MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BREXIT ON THE IMPORT AND EXPORT OF GOODS TO AND FROM THE UK, THE COMPANY HAS INCREASED ITS WAREHOUSE CAPACITY AND THE LEVEL OF INVENTORY WITHIN THE UK.  FOR GOODS THE COMPANY MANUFACTURES WITHIN THE UK AND EXPORTS TO OTHER COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY HAS MANUFACTURED AND SHIPPED ADDITIONAL GOODS FOR STORAGE IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UK IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN INVENTORY REQUIRED TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND IN THE EVENT OF DISRUPTION IN SHIPMENTS FROM THE UK.  THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF BREXIT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL RESULTS IS UNCERTAIN.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO THE \u201cITEM 1A\u2014RISK FACTORS\u201d SECTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  THE COMPANY HAS 8 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN THE UK, AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , LESS THAN 5% OF OUR SALES WERE DERIVED FROM CUSTOMERS LOCATED IN THE UK; HOWEVER, THE IMPACT OF BREXIT COULD ALSO IMPACT OUR SALES OUTSIDE THE UK.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NON-GAAP MEASURES  IN THIS REPORT, REFERENCES TO THE NON-GAAP MEASURE OF CORE SALES (ALSO REFERRED TO AS CORE REVENUES OR SALES/REVENUES FROM EXISTING BUSINESSES) REFER TO SALES CALCULATED ACCORDING TO U.S. GAAP, BUT EXCLUDING.  \u2022  SALES FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES; AND  \u2022  THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  REFERENCES TO SALES OR OPERATING PROFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACQUISITIONS OR ACQUIRED BUSINESSES REFER TO SALES OR OPERATING PROFIT, AS APPLICABLE, FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES RECORDED PRIOR TO THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ACQUISITION LESS THE AMOUNT OF SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT, AS APPLICABLE, ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIVESTED PRODUCT LINES NOT CONSIDERED DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  THE PORTION OF REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN.  \u2022  THE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGE IN REVENUE (EXCLUDING SALES FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES); AND  \u2022  THE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGE IN REVENUE (EXCLUDING SALES FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES) AFTER APPLYING CURRENT PERIOD FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  CORE SALES GROWTH SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A REPLACEMENT FOR OR SUPERIOR TO, SALES, AND MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT REPORTING THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF CORE SALES GROWTH PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BY HELPING IDENTIFY UNDERLYING GROWTH TRENDS IN DANAHER\u2019S BUSINESS AND FACILITATING COMPARISONS OF DANAHER\u2019S REVENUE PERFORMANCE WITH ITS PERFORMANCE IN PRIOR AND FUTURE PERIODS AND TO DANAHER\u2019S PEERS.  MANAGEMENT ALSO USES CORE SALES GROWTH TO MEASURE THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND USES IT AS ONE OF THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S EXECUTIVE SHORT-TERM CASH INCENTIVE PROGRAM.  THE COMPANY EXCLUDES THE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION FROM CORE SALES BECAUSE CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS NOT UNDER MANAGEMENT\u2019S CONTROL, IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY AND CAN OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS.  THE COMPANY EXCLUDES THE EFFECT OF ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURE-RELATED ITEMS BECAUSE THE NATURE, SIZE, TIMING AND NUMBER OF ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES CAN VARY DRAMATICALLY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD AND BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND ITS PEERS AND CAN ALSO OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS AND MAKE COMPARISONS OF LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE DIFFICULT.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THROUGHOUT THIS DISCUSSION, REFERENCES TO SALES VOLUME REFER TO THE IMPACT OF BOTH PRICE AND UNIT SALES AND REFERENCES TO PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS GENERALLY REFER TO IMPROVED COST-EFFICIENCIES RESULTING FROM THE ONGOING APPLICATION OF THE DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM.

IN JANUARY 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITH RESPECT TO APPROXIMATELY  $1.9 BILLION  OF ITS U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED BONDS TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT THESE U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED BONDS TO OBLIGATIONS DENOMINATED IN DANISH KRONER, JAPANESE YEN, EURO AND SWISS FRANC.  INTEREST INCOME OF  $26 MILLION  AND  $42 MILLION  FOR THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, WAS  $24 MILLION  HIGHER  AND  $38 MILLION  HIGHER  THAN THE COMPARABLE PERIODS OF  2018  , RESPECTIVELY, DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER AVERAGE CASH BALANCES DURING 2019 ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CASH RECEIVED FROM THE FIRST QUARTER 2019 COMMON STOCK AND MANDATORY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK (\u201cMCPS\u201d) OFFERINGS COMPLETED IN PREPARATION FOR THE GE BIOPHARMA ACQUISITION.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  ALSO INCLUDES NET DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS OF  $15 MILLION  (  $0.02  PER DILUTED SHARE) FROM THE RELEASE OF RESERVES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS DUE TO THE EXPIRATION OF STATUTES OF LIMITATION, BENEFITS FROM CHANGES IN TAX LAW IN A CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTION AND EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHARGES FROM AUDIT SETTLEMENTS  .  THESE DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS DECREASED THE REPORTED TAX RATE BY  1.7%.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR  THE  SIX  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  DIFFERS FROM THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF  21.0%  PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF NET DISCRETE CHARGES OF  $227 MILLION  (  $0.31  PER DILUTED SHARE) RELATED PRIMARILY TO CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH PRIOR PERIOD UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, NET OF THE RELEASE OF RESERVES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS DUE TO THE EXPIRATION OF STATUTES OF LIMITATION, RELEASE OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN TAX LAW AND EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  THESE DISCRETE INCOME TAX CHARGES INCREASED THE REPORTED TAX RATE BY  14.0%.  THESE CHARGES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BENEFITS FROM THE IMPACT OF EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHICH GENERALLY ARE TAXED AT RATES LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL RATE.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR BOTH THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2018  WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF  21.0%  DUE PRINCIPALLY TO THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHICH OVERALL ARE TAXED AT RATES LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL RATE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE AND SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2018  REFLECTS A U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE OF  21.0%  FROM THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\u201cTCJA\u201d), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NEW MINIMUM TAX ON CERTAIN NON-U.S. EARNINGS AS A RESULT OF THE TCJA.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2018  ALSO INCLUDES NET TAX BENEFITS OF  $9 MILLION  (  $0.01  PER DILUTED SHARE) FOR RELEASE OF RESERVES UPON THE EXPIRATION OF STATUTES OF LIMITATION AND EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH PRIOR PERIOD UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND OTHER MATTERS.  THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS GLOBALLY, AND FILES NUMEROUS CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE INCOME TAX RETURNS IN FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.  THE NON-U.S. COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE INCLUDE CHINA, DENMARK, GERMANY, SINGAPORE, SWITZERLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A CHANGE IN THE STATUTORY TAX RATE OF ANY INDIVIDUAL FOREIGN COUNTRY WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GIVEN THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISPERSION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME.  THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ROUTINELY EXAMINED BY VARIOUS DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TAXING AUTHORITIES.  THE IRS HAS COMPLETED THE EXAMINATIONS OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS THROUGH 2011 AND IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2012 THROUGH 2017.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS SUBSIDIARIES IN AUSTRIA, BELGIUM, CANADA, CHINA, DENMARK, FRANCE, GERMANY, INDIA, JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND, SINGAPORE, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM AND VARIOUS OTHER COUNTRIES, STATES AND PROVINCES THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT FOR YEARS RANGING FROM 2004 THROUGH 2017.  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THE IRS PROPOSED SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANY\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME FOR THE YEARS 2012 THROUGH 2015 WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFERRAL OF TAX ON CERTAIN PREMIUM INCOME RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S SELF-INSURANCE PROGRAMS.  FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES, THE RECOGNITION OF PREMIUM INCOME HAS BEEN DEFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. TAX LAWS RELATED TO INSURANCE.  THE IRS IS CHALLENGING THE DEFERRAL OF PREMIUMS FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF INSURANCE POLICIES.  THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS WOULD INCREASE THE COMPANY\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME OVER THE 2012-2015 PERIOD BY APPROXIMATELY  $2.7 BILLION.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE POSITIONS THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN IN ITS U.S. TAX RETURNS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT TAX LAWS, INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THESE POSITIONS AND IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING ALL OF ITS ALTERNATIVES.  DUE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA IN 2017 AND THE RESULTING REDUCTION IN THE U.S. CORPORATE TAX RATE FOR YEARS AFTER 2017, THE COMPANY REVALUED ITS DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DEFERRED PREMIUM INCOME FROM  35.0%  TO  21.0%.  IF THE COMPANY IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING THESE ASSESSMENTS, THE TAXES OWED TO THE IRS MAY BE COMPUTED UNDER THE PREVIOUS  35.0%  STATUTORY TAX RATE AND THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO REVALUE THE RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES FROM  21.0%  TO  35.0%  ,  WHICH IN ADDITION TO ANY INTEREST DUE ON THE AMOUNTS ASSESSED, WOULD REQUIRE A CHARGE TO FUTURE EARNINGS.  THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER IS UNCERTAIN, COULD TAKE MANY YEARS AND COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING ITS CASH FLOWS AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  TAX AUTHORITIES IN DENMARK HAVE RAISED SIGNIFICANT ISSUES RELATED TO INTEREST ACCRUED BY CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES.  ON DECEMBER 10, 2013, THE COMPANY RECEIVED ASSESSMENTS FROM  THE DANISH TAX AUTHORITY (\u201cSKAT\u201d)  TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  DKK 1.7 BILLION  INCLUDING INTEREST THROUGH  JUNE 28, 2019  (APPROXIMATELY  $262 MILLION  BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATE AS OF  JUNE 28, 2019  ), IMPOSING WITHHOLDING TAX RELATING TO INTEREST ACCRUED IN DENMARK ON BORROWINGS FROM CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES FOR THE YEARS 2004-2009.  THE COMPANY APPEALED THESE ASSESSMENTS TO THE DANISH NATIONAL TAX TRIBUNAL IN 2014, WHICH APPEAL HAS BEEN PENDING AWAITING THE OUTCOME OF OTHER CASES BROUGHT TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (\u201cCJEU\u201d).  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN DISCUSSIONS WITH SKAT AND ANTICIPATES RECEIVING AN ASSESSMENT FOR SIMILAR WITHHOLDING TAX MATTERS FOR THE YEARS 2010-2012 AND 2013-2015 TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  DKK 1.0 BILLION  AND  DKK 720 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY,  INCLUDING INTEREST THROUGH  JUNE 28, 2019  (APPROXIMATELY  $155 MILLION  AND  $110 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY,  BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATE AS OF  JUNE 28, 2019  ).  IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE CJEU DECIDED SEVERAL OTHER CASES RELATED TO DANISH WITHHOLDING TAX ON DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST.  IN THESE CASES, THE CJEU RULED THAT THE EXEMPTION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS FROM WITHHOLDING TAXES PROVIDED IN THE APPLICABLE  EU  DIRECTIVE SHOULD BE DENIED WHERE TAXPAYERS USE THE DIRECTIVE FOR ABUSIVE OR FRAUDULENT PURPOSES, AND THAT IT IS UP TO THE NATIONAL COURTS TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE POSITIONS THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN IN DENMARK ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT TAX LAWS AND IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ITS POSITIONS.  THE COMPANY INTENDS ON PURSUING THIS MATTER THROUGH THE DANISH HIGH COURT SHOULD THE APPEAL TO THE DANISH NATIONAL TAX TRIBUNAL BE UNSUCCESSFUL.  THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR DECISIONS OF BOTH THE DANISH COURTS AND THE CJEU AND EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THESE COURT RULINGS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S TAX POSITIONS IN DENMARK.  THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER IS UNCERTAIN, COULD TAKE MANY YEARS, AND COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING ITS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 TO BE APPROXIMATELY 20.0%.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD VARY AS A RESULT OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  THE EXPECTED RATE FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019  INCLUDES THE ANTICIPATED DISCRETE INCOME TAX BENEFITS FROM EXCESS TAX DEDUCTIONS RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION IN TAX EXPENSE, THOUGH THE ACTUAL BENEFITS (IF ANY) WILL DEPEND ON THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK PRICE AND STOCK OPTION EXERCISE PATTERNS.  \u2022  THE ACTUAL MIX OF EARNINGS BY JURISDICTION COULD FLUCTUATE FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S PROJECTION.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  THE TAX EFFECTS OF OTHER DISCRETE ITEMS, INCLUDING ACCRUALS RELATED TO TAX CONTINGENCIES, THE RESOLUTION OF WORLDWIDE TAX MATTERS, TAX AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS EXPIRATIONS AND CHANGES IN TAX REGULATIONS.  \u2022  ANY FUTURE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES OR POTENTIAL TAX REFORM, THE IMPACT OF FUTURE REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE IMPLEMENTING THE TCJA AND ANY RELATED ADDITIONAL TAX PLANNING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THESE CHANGES.  AS A RESULT OF THE UNCERTAINTY IN PREDICTING THESE ITEMS, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE USED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES WILL CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  FOR THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  , COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  INCREASED  $644 MILLION  AND  INCREASED  $105 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIODS OF  2018  , PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN NET EARNINGS AND CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS IN THE PERIODS.  NET EARNINGS INCREASED  $58 MILLION  IN THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  VERSUS THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD IN 2018, AND NET EARNINGS DECREASED  $175 MILLION  IN THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD IN 2019 VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN 2018.  FOR THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  , THE COMPANY RECORDED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  LOSS  ES OF  $47 MILLION  AND  $57 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  LOSS  ES OF  $641 MILLION  AND  $347 MILLION  FOR THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2018  , RESULTING IN A DECREASE IN LOSSES FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS OF  $595 MILLION  AND  $290 MILLION  FOR THE THREE AND SIX-MONTH PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY.  INFLATION  THE EFFECT OF INFLATION ON THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  MANAGEMENT ASSESSES THE COMPANY\u2019S LIQUIDITY IN TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH TO FUND ITS OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND FORECASTS THAT ITS OPERATING CASH FLOW AND OTHER SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY (INCLUDING THE ANTICIPATED FINANCING FOR THE GE BIOPHARMA ACQUISITION) WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN EXISTING BUSINESSES, CONSUMMATING STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING THE ANTICIPATED GE BIOPHARMA ACQUISITION), PAYING INTEREST AND SERVICING DEBT AND MANAGING ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE ON A SHORT AND LONG-TERM BASIS.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOLLOWING IS AN OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY ($ IN MILLIONS).

OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD AS WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS FOR INCOME TAXES, RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, PENSION FUNDING AND OTHER ITEMS IMPACT REPORTED CASH FLOWS.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS WERE  $1,875 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  2019  ,  AN INCREASE  OF  $10 MILLION  , OR APPROXIMATELY  0.5%  , AS COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  .  THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS FROM  2018  TO  2019  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.  \u2022  2019  OPERATING CASH FLOWS REFLECTED  A DECREASE  OF  $175 MILLION  IN NET EARNINGS FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN  2018  .

AMORTIZATION EXPENSE PRIMARILY RELATES TO THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS AND INCREASED DUE TO RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES.

AUTOMOTIVE REFINISH COATINGS SALES VOLUMES DECREASED BY A MID-SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DUE TO STRONG SALES VOLUMES IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE IN THE PRIOR YEAR. U.S. INDUSTRY DEMAND WAS SOFT EVIDENCED BY LOWER COLLISION CLAIMS DURING THE QUARTER.  AEROSPACE COATINGS SALES VOLUMES GREW BY A HIGH-SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE IN THE QUARTER. THIS INCREASE WAS SUPPORTED BY TECHNOLOGY-ADVANTAGED PRODUCTS, ABOVE-MARKET VOLUME GROWTH AND SALES GROWTH ACROSS ALL MAJOR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS.  PROTECTIVE AND MARINE COATINGS SALES VOLUMES INCREASED BY A MID-SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE DRIVEN BY STRONG SALES VOLUMES IN CHINA AND EUROPE.

LOOKING AHEAD  LOOKING AHEAD, INDUSTRY DEMAND LEVELS ARE EXPECTED TO BE SIMILAR TO THOSE EXPERIENCED IN THE SECOND QUARTER. SALES WILL BE SEQUENTIALLY MODESTLY LOWER DUE TO NORMAL SEASONALITY. ACQUISITION-RELATED SALES ARE FORECAST TO ADD ABOUT $15 MILLION OF SALES GROWTH PRIMARILY FROM THE SEM ACQUISITION. BASED ON CURRENT EXCHANGE RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A MODEST UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON SEGMENT SALES OF APPROXIMATELY $15 TO $25 MILLION.

PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE LOWER SALES VOLUMES WERE HIGHER SELLING PRICES IN ALL MAJOR REGIONS.  INDUSTRIAL COATINGS SALES VOLUMES WERE DOWN A LOW-SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE IN THE SECOND QUARTER. SALES VOLUMES WERE IMPACTED BY LOWER COIL, GENERAL FINISHES, APPLIANCES AND TRANSPORTATION END-USE DEMAND. SELLING PRICES CONTINUED TO INCREASE DURING THE QUARTER.  PACKAGING COATINGS ORGANIC SALES WERE DOWN A LOW-SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR, AS YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH MODERATED DUE TO MORE MODEST CUSTOMER ADOPTION RATES FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES. SALES VOLUMES INCREASED IN LATIN AMERICA DUE TO RECENT CUSTOMER WINS IN THE REGION.  SEGMENT INCOME INCREASED $12 MILLION YEAR-OVER-YEAR, INCLUDING UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION RELATED TO THE CHINESE YUAN AND THE EURO. SEGMENT INCOME BENEFITED FROM IMPROVING SELLING PRICES AND COST SAVINGS INITIATIVES, WHICH WERE OFFSET BY THE EARNINGS IMPACT OF LOWER SALES VOLUMES.  LOOKING AHEAD  LOOKING AHEAD, WE EXPECT THAT GLOBAL INDUSTRIAL DEMAND WILL REMAIN SUBDUED THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER WITH INCONSISTENCIES BY REGION. SALES VOLUME TRENDS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN SIMILAR IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND MODESTLY IMPROVE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE IMPLEMENTING SELLING PRICE INCREASES AND OPERATING MARGIN RECOVERY.

BASED ON CURRENT EXCHANGE RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A MODEST UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON SEGMENT SALES OF APPROXIMATELY $15 TO $25 MILLION.  FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE, INDUSTRIAL COATINGS SALES VOLUMES ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE SIMILAR IN THE THIRD QUARTER DUE TO THE EXPECTED CONTINUATION OF WEAK INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION ACTIVITY.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS, AND APPLY JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.  WE BASE OUR ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT TRENDS AND OTHER FACTORS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES TO BE RELEVANT AT THE TIME OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED.  ON A REGULAR BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS TO ENSURE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PRESENTED FAIRLY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE FUTURE EVENTS AND THEIR EFFECTS CANNOT BE DETERMINED WITH CERTAINTY, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES, AND SUCH DIFFERENCES COULD BE MATERIAL.  23  WE DESCRIBE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 201  8.  S  IGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES SUBSEQUENT TO THE FILING OF OUR FORM 10-K, RELATE  TO THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC  842  ,  LEASES  , AS DISCUSSED IN NOTES 1 AND  4  TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION, INVESTIGATIONS AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL, EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS. WE ESTIMATE AND ACCRUE OUR LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM SUCH MATTERS BASED UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STAGE OF THE PROCEEDING; POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT VALUE; ASSESSMENTS BY INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COUNSEL; AND ASSESSMENTS BY ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERS AND CONSULTANTS OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND REMEDIATION COSTS.  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY ACCRUED FOR THESE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES; HOWEVER, FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY CHANGE, SUCH AS NEW DEVELOPMENTS, OR A CHANGE IN APPROACH, INCLUDING A CHANGE IN SETTLEMENT STRATEGY OR IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION PLAN, THAT COULD CAUSE THE ACTUAL LIABILITY TO EXCEED THE ESTIMATES, OR MAY REQUIRE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RECORDED LIABILITY BALANCES IN THE FUTURE.  OUR ESTIMATE OF LIABILITY AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY AND OUR REMAINING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REMEDIATE THE LOWER PASSAIC RIVER IN NEW JERSEY AND OTHER SITES ARE ACCRUED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, OUR AGGREGATE ENVIRONMENTAL RELATED ACCRUALS WERE $2.6 MILLION, OF WHICH $0.7 MILLION WAS INCLUDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES, WITH THE REMAINDER INCLUDED IN NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES. AS RELATED TO CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, THE ACCRUAL WAS ESTIMATED AT THE LOW END OF A RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES SINCE NO AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE THAN ANY OTHER AMOUNT.  IF WE HAD ACCRUED AT THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, FOR THOSE SITES WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE OUR LIABILITY, OUR ACCRUAL WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION HIGHER.  THESE ACCRUALS CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE NATURE OR EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE METHODS OF REMEDIATION REQUIRED, CHANGES IN THE APPORTIONMENT OF COSTS AMONG RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE COVERAGE AND OTHER ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES OR PRIVATE PARTIES, OR THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF BEING NAMED IN A NEW MATTER.

WE ARE A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED PAYMENTS COMPANY THAT PROVIDES OUR CUSTOMERS WITH ACCESS TO PRODUCTS, INSIGHTS AND EXPERIENCES THAT ENRICH LIVES AND BUILD BUSINESS SUCCESS. OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE CHARGE AND CREDIT CARD PRODUCTS AND TRAVEL-RELATED SERVICES OFFERED TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD. OUR RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDES.  \u2022  CHARGE CARD, CREDIT CARD AND OTHER PAYMENT AND FINANCING PRODUCTS  \u2022  MERCHANT ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING, SERVICING AND SETTLEMENT, AND POINT-OF-SALE MARKETING AND INFORMATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS  \u2022  NETWORK SERVICES  \u2022  OTHER FEE SERVICES, INCLUDING FRAUD PREVENTION SERVICES AND THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF CUSTOMER LOYALTY PROGRAMS  \u2022  EXPENSE MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  \u2022  TRAVEL-RELATED SERVICES  OUR VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE SOLD GLOBALLY TO DIVERSE CUSTOMER GROUPS, INCLUDING CONSUMERS, LARGE CORPORATIONS, MID-SIZED COMPANIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES. THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE SOLD THROUGH VARIOUS CHANNELS, INCLUDING MOBILE AND ONLINE APPLICATIONS, DIRECT MAIL, IN-HOUSE SALES TEAMS, THIRD-PARTY VENDORS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, AND DIRECT RESPONSE ADVERTISING. BUSINESS TRAVEL-RELATED SERVICES ARE OFFERED THROUGH OUR NON-CONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE, AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL (THE GBT JV).  WE COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WITH CHARGE, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD NETWORKS, ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS, PAPER-BASED TRANSACTIONS (E.G., CASH AND CHECKS), BANK TRANSFER MODELS (E.G., WIRE TRANSFERS AND AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE (ACH)), AS WELL AS EVOLVING AND GROWING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT AND FINANCING PROVIDERS. AS THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, WE FACE INCREASING COMPETITION FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS THAT LEVERAGE NEW TECHNOLOGIES, BUSINESS MODELS AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS TO CREATE PAYMENT OR FINANCING SOLUTIONS.  THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF REVENUE ARE GENERATED FROM OUR VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  \u2022  DISCOUNT REVENUE, OUR LARGEST REVENUE SOURCE, PRIMARILY REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT WE EARN ON TRANSACTIONS OCCURRING AT MERCHANTS THAT HAVE ENTERED INTO A CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT WITH US, OR A GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES (GNS) PARTNER OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY MERCHANT ACQUIRER, FOR FACILITATING TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE MERCHANTS AND CARD MEMBERS;  \u2022  INTEREST ON LOANS, PRINCIPALLY REPRESENTS INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON OUTSTANDING BALANCES;  \u2022  NET CARD FEES, REPRESENT REVENUE EARNED FROM ANNUAL CARD MEMBERSHIP FEES, WHICH VARY BASED ON THE TYPE OF CARD AND THE NUMBER OF CARDS FOR EACH ACCOUNT;  \u2022  OTHER FEES AND COMMISSIONS, PRIMARILY REPRESENT CARD MEMBER DELINQUENCY FEES, FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION FEES CHARGED TO CARD MEMBERS, LOYALTY COALITION-RELATED FEES, TRAVEL COMMISSIONS AND FEES, SERVICE FEES EARNED FROM MERCHANTS, AND MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM FEES; AND  \u2022  OTHER REVENUE, PRIMARILY REPRESENTS REVENUES ARISING FROM CONTRACTS WITH PARTNERS OF OUR GNS BUSINESS (INCLUDING COMMISSIONS AND SIGNING FEES LESS ISSUER RATE PAYMENTS), CROSS-BORDER CARD MEMBER SPENDING, ANCILLARY MERCHANT-RELATED FEES, INSURANCE PREMIUMS EARNED FROM CARD MEMBERS, EARNINGS FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING THE GBT JV), AND PREPAID CARD AND TRAVELERS CHEQUE-RELATED REVENUE.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND NON-GAAP MEASURES  CERTAIN OF THE STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-Q ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. REFER TO THE \u201cCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d SECTION. WE PREPARE OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP). HOWEVER, CERTAIN INFORMATION INCLUDED WITHIN THIS FORM 10-Q CONSTITUTES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. OUR CALCULATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY DIFFER FROM THE CALCULATIONS OF SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES BY OTHER COMPANIES.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BANK HOLDING COMPANY  AMERICAN EXPRESS IS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956 AND THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE) IS OUR PRIMARY FEDERAL REGULATOR. AS SUCH, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE\u2019S REGULATIONS, POLICIES AND MINIMUM CAPITAL STANDARDS.  BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT  OUR RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER REFLECT SOLID PERFORMANCE THAT CONTINUES TO DEMONSTRATE BROAD BASED GROWTH ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIES. WE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN NEW SERVICES AND CARD MEMBER BENEFITS, NEW CARD ACQUISITIONS AND EXPANDING OUR MERCHANT NETWORK, WHILE CONTINUING TO RETURN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS INCREASED 5 PERCENT OVER THE PRIOR YEAR AND WORLDWIDE PROPRIETARY BILLINGS, WHICH COMPRISES 86% OF OUR TOTAL BILLINGS, GREW 7 PERCENT LED BY CONSUMERS. THE US DOLLAR REMAINED STRONG, RELATIVE TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AGAINST MOST MAJOR CURRENCIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, RESULTING IN A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BILLINGS AND REVENUE GROWTH. AFTER ADJUSTING FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE (FX) RATES, WORLDWIDE PROPRIETARY BILLED BUSINESS INCREASED 8 PERCENT OVER THE PRIOR YEAR, WITH INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY BILLINGS CONTINUING DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH.  1  THIS SPENDING IS OCCURRING AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF AN ECONOMY THAT IS GROWING AT A STEADY BUT MORE MODEST PACE RELATIVE TO 2018. GNS BILLED BUSINESS DECLINED AS WE CONTINUE TO EXIT THE NETWORK BUSINESS IN EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA DUE TO CERTAIN REGULATORY CHANGES; EXCLUDING THE BILLINGS FROM THOSE GEOGRAPHIES, GNS BILLED BUSINESS GREW 6 PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR ON AN FX-ADJUSTED BASIS.  1  REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED 8 PERCENT (10 PERCENT ON AN FX-ADJUSTED BASIS), DRIVEN BY A WELL-BALANCED MIX OF GROWTH ACROSS CARD MEMBER SPENDING, LOAN VOLUMES AND CARD FEES.  1  THIS WAS THE EIGHTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER WITH FX-ADJUSTED REVENUE GROWTH OF 8 PERCENT OR BETTER, COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  1  THE INCREASE IN CARD FEES REFLECTS OUR DISCIPLINED APPROACH OF ENHANCING THE VALUE OF OUR PREMIUM PRODUCTS BY ADDING NEW BENEFITS THAT ARE DRIVING HIGHER ENGAGEMENT WITH NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS.  CARD MEMBER LOANS GREW YEAR-OVER-YEAR, AS WE CONTINUED TO EXPAND OUR LENDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND ACQUIRED NEW CARD MEMBERS. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES INCREASED AS A RESULT OF HIGHER CARD MEMBER LOANS AND RECEIVABLES AND A MODEST INCREASE IN NET WRITE-OFF RATES. THIS GROWTH IN PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES WAS BELOW OUR EXPECTATIONS.  SPENDING ON CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT (THE AGGREGATE OF REWARDS, CARD MEMBER SERVICES, AND MARKETING AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES) INCREASED YEAR-OVER-YEAR ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES. INCREASES IN REWARDS AND CARD MEMBER SERVICES REFLECTED THE GROWTH IN PROPRIETARY BILLINGS AND CONTINUED INVESTMENT AND USAGE ACROSS MANY OF OUR PREMIUM TRAVEL-RELATED BENEFITS. MARKETING AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE GREW DUE TO CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN OUR COBRAND PARTNERSHIPS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED RENEWAL OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH DELTA AIR LINES, AND HIGHER CORPORATE CLIENT INCENTIVES, ALTHOUGH THE GROWTH MODERATED COMPARED TO RECENT QUARTERS AS WE HAVE MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED MARKETING SPENDING THIS YEAR RELATIVE TO 2018 WHEN WE LAUNCHED OUR GLOBAL BRAND CAMPAIGN IN THE SECOND QUARTER.  WE CONTINUE TO SEE ATTRACTIVE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES AND PLAN TO INVEST TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM IN ORDER TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH OVER THE MODERATE TO LONG TERM. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO SEE SOME HEADWINDS IN THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING FROM REGULATION IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AND INTENSE COMPETITION, WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON DELIVERING DIFFERENTIATED VALUE TO OUR MERCHANTS, CARD MEMBERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS AND DELIVERING APPROPRIATE RETURNS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  SEE \u201cCERTAIN LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS\u201d FOR INFORMATION ON CERTAIN MATTERS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  1  THE FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTED INFORMATION ASSUMES A CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN THE PERIODS BEING COMPARED FOR PURPOSES OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION INTO U.S. DOLLARS (I.E., ASSUMES THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES USED TO DETERMINE RESULTS FOR THE CURRENT PERIOD APPLY TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AGAINST WHICH SUCH RESULTS ARE BEING COMPARED). FX-ADJUSTED REVENUES AND EXPENSES CONSTITUTE NON-GAAP MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THE PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION ON A FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTED BASIS IS HELPFUL TO INVESTORS BY MAKING IT EASIER TO COMPARE OUR PERFORMANCE IN ONE PERIOD TO THAT OF ANOTHER PERIOD WITHOUT THE VARIABILITY CAUSED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REFER TO THE \u201cGLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY\u201d FOR THE DEFINITIONS OF CERTAIN KEY TERMS AND RELATED INFORMATION APPEARING WITHIN THIS SECTION.

THE CARD MEMBER REWARDS EXPENSE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER PROPRIETARY AND COBRAND SPENDING VOLUMES. THE INCREASE IN CARD MEMBER SERVICES EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER USAGE OF TRAVEL-RELATED BENEFITS. THE INCREASE IN MARKETING AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER COBRAND PARTNER PAYMENTS.  SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED FOR BOTH THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER SERVICING-RELATED COSTS, INCREASED PAYROLL COSTS AND A PRIOR YEAR VALUE-ADDED TAX (VAT) RESERVE RELEASE.

FAILURE TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM CAPITAL LEVELS AT AMERICAN EXPRESS OR AENB COULD AFFECT OUR STATUS AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND CAUSE THE REGULATORY AGENCIES WITH OVERSIGHT OF AMERICAN EXPRESS OR AENB TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT COULD LIMIT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF EQUITY CAPITAL HAS BEEN THE GENERATION OF NET INCOME. CAPITAL GENERATED THROUGH NET INCOME AND OTHER SOURCES, SUCH AS THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS BY EMPLOYEES, IS USED TO MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET, SUPPORT ASSET GROWTH AND ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS, WITH EXCESS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THE PORTION OF GENERATED CAPITAL WE ALLOCATE TO SUPPORT ASSET GROWTH WILL BE GREATER GOING FORWARD THAN IT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY DUE TO PROJECTED ASSET GROWTH.  WE MAINTAIN CERTAIN FLEXIBILITY TO SHIFT CAPITAL ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES AS APPROPRIATE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY INFUSE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INTO SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL AT TARGETED LEVELS IN CONSIDERATION OF DEBT RATINGS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THESE INFUSED AMOUNTS CAN AFFECT THE CAPITAL PROFILE AND LIQUIDITY LEVELS AT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS PARENT COMPANY LEVEL.  THE FOLLOWING ARE DEFINITIONS FOR OUR REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS AND LEVERAGE RATIO, WHICH ARE CALCULATED AS PER STANDARD REGULATORY GUIDANCE.  RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS  \u2014 ASSETS ARE WEIGHTED FOR RISK ACCORDING TO A FORMULA USED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO CONFORM TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES. ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS ARE WEIGHTED FOR RISK, WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS CONVERTED TO BALANCE SHEET EQUIVALENTS, USING RISK CONVERSION FACTORS, BEFORE BEING ALLOCATED A RISK-ADJUSTED WEIGHT. OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES COMPRISE A MINIMAL PART OF THE TOTAL RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.  COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED AS COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL (CET1), DIVIDED BY RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. CET1 IS THE SUM OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY, ADJUSTED FOR INELIGIBLE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ITEMS AS FOLLOWS: NET UNREALIZED GAINS/LOSSES ON SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS AND NET UNREALIZED PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT/LOSSES, ALL NET OF TAX.  TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TIER 1 CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF CET1, OUR PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK AND THIRD-PARTY NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ADJUSTED FOR CAPITAL HELD BY INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FOR THE TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO IS 1.5 PERCENT HIGHER THAN THE MINIMUM FOR THE CET1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO. WE HAVE $1.6 BILLION OF PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING TO HELP ADDRESS A PORTION OF THE TIER 1 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN EXCESS OF COMMON EQUITY REQUIREMENTS.  TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL, DIVIDED BY RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TIER 2 CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND RECEIVABLE LOSSES (LIMITED TO 1.25 PERCENT OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS), MINORITY INTEREST THAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN TIER 1 CAPITAL AND $600 MILLION OF SUBORDINATED NOTES, ADJUSTED FOR CAPITAL HELD BY INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES.  TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED BY DIVIDING TIER 1 CAPITAL BY OUR AVERAGE TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS FOR THE MOST RECENT QUARTER.  SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED BY DIVIDING TIER 1 CAPITAL BY TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE UNDER BASEL III. TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE REFLECTS AVERAGE TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS WITH ADJUSTMENTS FOR TIER 1 CAPITAL DEDUCTIONS, AVERAGE OFF-BALANCE SHEET DERIVATIVE EXPOSURES, AVERAGE SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL, AND AVERAGE CREDIT EQUIVALENTS OF CONDITIONALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY CANCELLABLE UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS.  IN DECEMBER 2018, FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ISSUED A FINAL RULE THAT WOULD PROVIDE AN OPTIONAL THREE-YEAR PHASE-IN PERIOD FOR THE DAY-ONE ADVERSE REGULATORY CAPITAL EFFECTS UPON ADOPTING THE CURRENT EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (CECL) MODEL PURSUANT TO NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR THE RECOGNITION OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020. THE FEDERAL RESERVE ALSO RELEASED A STATEMENT INDICATING THAT IT PLANS TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK FOR CALCULATING CREDIT LOSS ALLOWANCES ON LOANS IN SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTS THROUGH THE 2021 STRESS TEST CYCLE. SEE NOTE 1 TO OUR \u201cCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT CECL.  55  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS  WE RETURN CAPITAL TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. THE SHARE REPURCHASES REDUCE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING AND MORE THAN OFFSET THE ISSUANCE OF NEW SHARES AS PART OF EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS.  DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE RETURNED $0.9 BILLION AND $2.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS OF $0.3 BILLION AND $0.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND SHARE REPURCHASES OF $0.6 BILLION AND $1.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE REPURCHASED 5.5 MILLION COMMON SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $115.59 IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. THESE DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE AMOUNTS COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 52 PERCENT AND 76 PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITAL GENERATED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY.  IN ADDITION, DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE PAID $19 MILLION AND $40 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN DIVIDENDS ON NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING.  WE PLAN TO INCREASE THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON OUR COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING TO $0.43 PER SHARE, FROM $0.39 PER SHARE, BEGINNING WITH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  FUNDING STRATEGY  OUR PRINCIPAL FUNDING OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN BROAD AND WELL-DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES TO ALLOW US TO MEET OUR MATURING OBLIGATIONS, COST-EFFECTIVELY FINANCE CURRENT AND FUTURE ASSET GROWTH IN OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES AS WELL AS TO MAINTAIN A STRONG LIQUIDITY PROFILE.  WE MEET OUR FUNDING NEEDS THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTED DEPOSITS AND DEBT INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT, ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, BORROWINGS THROUGH SECURED BORROWING FACILITIES AND A LONG-TERM COMMITTED BANK BORROWING FACILITY. WHILE WE DIVERSIFY OUR FUNDING SOURCES BY MAINTAINING SCALE AND RELEVANCE IN UNSECURED DEBT, ASSET SECURITIZATIONS AND DEPOSITS, WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THE PERSONAL SAVINGS HIGH YIELD SAVINGS ACCOUNT PROGRAM WILL BECOME A LARGER PROPORTION OF OUR FUNDING OVER TIME.  SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT  WE HAD THE FOLLOWING CONSOLIDATED DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS OUTSTANDING AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018.

DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE ISSUED (I) $1.5 BILLION OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES FROM THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT ACCOUNT MASTER TRUST (THE LENDING TRUST) CONSISTING OF $1.5 BILLION OF THREE YEAR CLASS A CERTIFICATES AT A FIXED RATE OF 2.67 PERCENT, AND (II) $3.0 BILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY CONSISTING OF $1.25 BILLION OF THREE YEAR NOTES AT A FIXED RATE OF 2.75 PERCENT, $900 MILLION OF THREE YEAR NOTES AT A FLOATING RATE OF 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 62 BASIS POINTS, AND $850 MILLION OF SEVEN YEAR NOTES AT A FIXED RATE OF 3.125 PERCENT.  OUR FUNDING PLAN FOR THE FULL YEAR 2019 INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER SOURCES, APPROXIMATELY $6 BILLION TO $11 BILLION OF UNSECURED TERM DEBT ISSUANCE AND APPROXIMATELY $5 BILLION TO $9 BILLION OF SECURED TERM DEBT ISSUANCE. OUR FUNDING PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, SUCH AS FUTURE BUSINESS GROWTH, THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND OTHER EVENTS ON MARKET CAPACITY, DEMAND FOR SECURITIES OFFERED BY US, REGULATORY CHANGES, ABILITY TO SECURITIZE AND SELL RECEIVABLES, AND THE PERFORMANCE OF RECEIVABLES PREVIOUSLY SOLD IN SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS. MANY OF THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  56  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR EQUITY CAPITAL AND FUNDING STRATEGIES ARE DESIGNED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE AND STABLE UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS FROM THE MAJOR CREDIT RATING AGENCIES: MOODY\u2019S INVESTOR SERVICES (MOODY\u2019S), STANDARD & POOR\u2019S (S&P) AND FITCH RATINGS (FITCH). SUCH RATINGS HELP SUPPORT OUR ACCESS TO COST-EFFECTIVE UNSECURED FUNDING AS PART OF OUR OVERALL FUNDING STRATEGY. OUR ASSET SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES ARE RATED SEPARATELY.

DOWNGRADES IN THE RATINGS OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT OR ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAM SECURITIES COULD RESULT IN HIGHER FUNDING COSTS, AS WELL AS HIGHER FEES RELATED TO BORROWINGS UNDER OUR UNUSED LINES OF CREDIT. DECLINES IN CREDIT RATINGS COULD ALSO REDUCE OUR BORROWING CAPACITY IN THE UNSECURED DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATION CAPITAL MARKETS. WE BELIEVE OUR FUNDING MIX, INCLUDING THE PROPORTION OF U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION TO TOTAL FUNDING, SHOULD REDUCE THE IMPACT THAT CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADES WOULD HAVE ON OUR FUNDING CAPACITY AND COSTS.  LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT  OUR LIQUIDITY OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO A DIVERSE SET OF ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY SOURCES. WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY SOURCES IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR EXPECTED FUTURE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR LIQUIDITY FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS IN THE EVENT WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE NEW FUNDS UNDER OUR REGULAR FUNDING PROGRAMS DURING A SUBSTANTIAL WEAKENING IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  OUR LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY INCLUDES A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO.  \u2022  MAINTAINING DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES (REFER TO THE \u201cFUNDING STRATEGY\u201d SECTION FOR MORE DETAILS);  \u2022  MAINTAINING UNENCUMBERED LIQUID ASSETS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY SOURCES;  \u2022  PROJECTING CASH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS UNDER A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC AND MARKET SCENARIOS;  \u2022  ESTABLISHING CLEAR OBJECTIVES FOR LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS; AND  \u2022  INCORPORATING LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT AS APPROPRIATE INTO OUR CAPITAL ADEQUACY FRAMEWORK.  THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF LIQUIDITY RESOURCES WE MAINTAIN CAN VARY OVER TIME, BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF STRESS SCENARIOS REQUIRED UNDER THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (DODD-FRANK) AND OTHER VARIOUS REGULATORY LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL STRESS SCENARIOS REQUIRED UNDER OUR LIQUIDITY RISK POLICY.  THE INVESTMENT INCOME WE RECEIVE ON LIQUIDITY RESOURCES IS LESS THAN THE INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR THESE BALANCES. THE NET INTEREST COSTS TO MAINTAIN THESE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL. THE LEVEL OF FUTURE NET INTEREST COSTS DEPENDS ON THE AMOUNT OF LIQUIDITY RESOURCES WE MAINTAIN AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COST OF FUNDING THESE AMOUNTS AND THEIR INVESTMENT YIELDS.  57  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SECURITIZED BORROWING CAPACITY  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE MAINTAINED A COMMITTED, REVOLVING, SECURED BORROWING FACILITY, WITH A MATURITY DATE OF JULY 15, 2020, WHICH GIVES US THE RIGHT TO SELL UP TO $3.0 BILLION FACE AMOUNT OF ELIGIBLE AAA NOTES FROM THE AMERICAN EXPRESS ISSUANCE TRUST II (THE CHARGE TRUST). ON JULY 12, 2019, WE EXTENDED THE CHARGE TRUST'S $3.0 BILLION FACILITY BY TWO YEARS TO MATURE ON JULY 15, 2022. WE ALSO MAINTAINED A COMMITTED, REVOLVING, SECURED BORROWING FACILITY, WITH A MATURITY DATE OF SEPTEMBER 15, 2020, WHICH GIVES US THE RIGHT TO SELL UP TO $2.0 BILLION FACE AMOUNT OF ELIGIBLE AAA CERTIFICATES FROM THE LENDING TRUST. BOTH FACILITIES ARE USED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO FUND SEASONAL WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, AS WELL AS TO FURTHER ENHANCE OUR CONTINGENT FUNDING RESOURCES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, NO AMOUNTS WERE DRAWN ON EITHER FACILITY.  FEDERAL RESERVE DISCOUNT WINDOW  AS AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, AENB MAY BORROW FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO, SUBJECT TO THE AMOUNT OF QUALIFYING COLLATERAL THAT IT MAY PLEDGE. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED THAT BOTH CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES ARE A FORM OF QUALIFYING COLLATERAL FOR SECURED BORROWINGS MADE THROUGH THE DISCOUNT WINDOW. WHETHER SPECIFIC ASSETS WILL BE CONSIDERED QUALIFYING COLLATERAL AND THE AMOUNT THAT MAY BE BORROWED AGAINST THE COLLATERAL, REMAIN AT THE DISCRETION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE.  WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $74.9 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 IN U.S. CREDIT CARD LOANS AND CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES THAT COULD BE SOLD OVER TIME THROUGH OUR SECURITIZATION TRUSTS OR PLEDGED IN RETURN FOR SECURED BORROWINGS TO PROVIDE FURTHER LIQUIDITY, SUBJECT IN EACH CASE TO APPLICABLE MARKET CONDITIONS AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA.  COMMITTED BANK CREDIT FACILITY  IN ADDITION TO THE SECURED BORROWING FACILITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE MAINTAINED A COMMITTED SYNDICATED BANK CREDIT FACILITY AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 OF $3.5 BILLION, WHICH EXPIRES ON OCTOBER 16, 2020. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, NO AMOUNTS WERE DRAWN ON THIS FACILITY.  UNUSED CREDIT OUTSTANDING  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $299 BILLION OF UNUSED CREDIT OUTSTANDING AS PART OF ESTABLISHED LENDING PRODUCT AGREEMENTS. TOTAL UNUSED CREDIT DOES NOT REPRESENT POTENTIAL FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS, AS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS UNUSED CREDIT WILL LIKELY NOT BE DRAWN. OUR CHARGE CARD PRODUCTS GENERALLY HAVE NO PRE-SET LIMIT, AND THEREFORE ARE NOT REFLECTED IN UNUSED CREDIT AVAILABLE TO CARD MEMBERS.  CASH FLOWS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOW ACTIVITY FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30.  TABLE 20: CASH FLOWS  (BILLIONS)  2019  2018  TOTAL CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN).  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $11.5  $5.1  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (10.5  )  (8.4  )  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (1.5  )  1.2  EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH  \u2014  0.1  NET DECREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH  $(0.5  )  $(2.0  )  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR (I) NON-CASH ITEMS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME, SUCH AS PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, DEFERRED TAXES AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND (II) CHANGES IN THE BALANCES OF OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS DUE TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS.  THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES.  58  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CHANGES IN CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO.  THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS DRIVEN BY A LARGER NET INCREASE IN THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEPOSITS, LONG-TERM DEBT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, AS WELL AS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF SHARE REPURCHASES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  OTHER MATTERS  CERTAIN LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS  WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, AND THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE ARE SUBSTANTIAL. IN RECENT YEARS, THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS SCRUTINY, HIGH REGULATORY EXPECTATIONS, AND A STRINGENT AND UNPREDICTABLE ENFORCEMENT ENVIRONMENT.  GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES HAVE FOCUSED, AND WE BELIEVE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS, CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION ON REVIEWING COMPLIANCE BY FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS. REVIEWS TO ASSESS COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INTERNAL REVIEWS, HAVE RESULTED IN, AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, CHANGES TO OUR PRACTICES, PRODUCTS AND PROCEDURES, RESTITUTION TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY ACTIONS AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE THE SUBJECT OF SUCH ACTIONS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL INQUIRIES, INVESTIGATIONS, ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS AND THE IMPOSITION OF FINES OR CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES, IN THE EVENT OF NONCOMPLIANCE OR ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANCE WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE BEEN COOPERATING WITH CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES THAT HAVE REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM, OR SERVED SUBPOENAS ON, US, SEEKING INFORMATION RELATING TO A SMALL, SPECIALIZED PART OF OUR BUSINESS, KNOWN AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS (FXIP), WHICH OFFERS CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS SERVICES PRIMARILY TO SMALL AND MIDDLE MARKET BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN FIVE COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. IN PARTICULAR, WE RECEIVED INVESTIGATIVE SUBPOENAS FROM BOTH THE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL DIVISIONS OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS WELL AS INQUIRIES FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY, THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU (CFPB), THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION AND OTHERS.  FXIP ACCOUNTS FOR LESS THAN ONE HALF OF ONE PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND IS UNRELATED TO OUR CARD BUSINESSES. RELATEDLY, OUR REVIEW OF FXIP\u2019S PRICING PRACTICES CONDUCTED WITH AN OUTSIDE LAW FIRM HAS CONCLUDED AND AS A RESULT, WE ARE VOLUNTARILY PROVIDING APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION OF REMEDIATION TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS COVERING A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD AND TAKING DISCIPLINARY ACTION WHERE APPROPRIATE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS MATTER WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS OR RESULTS.  PLEASE SEE THE \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 (THE 2018 FORM 10-K) FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  PAYMENTS REGULATION  LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE FOCUSED ON THE OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING THROUGH ANTITRUST ACTIONS, LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS TO CHANGE CERTAIN PRACTICES OR PRICING OF CARD ISSUERS, MERCHANT ACQUIRERS AND PAYMENT NETWORKS, AND, IN SOME CASES, TO ESTABLISH BROAD AND ONGOING REGULATORY OVERSIGHT REGIMES FOR PAYMENT SYSTEMS.  59  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS HAVE FOCUSED ON INTERCHANGE FEES (THAT IS, THE FEE PAID BY THE BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUER IN PAYMENT NETWORKS LIKE VISA AND MASTERCARD), AS WELL AS THE RULES, CONTRACT TERMS AND PRACTICES GOVERNING MERCHANT CARD ACCEPTANCE. REGULATION AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS RELATING TO PRICING OR PRACTICES COULD AFFECT ALL NETWORKS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, AS WELL AS ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMERS AND MERCHANTS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATION OF BANKCARD FEES HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE DISCOUNT REVENUE WE EARN, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON OUR DISCOUNT RATE FROM DECREASES IN COMPETITOR PRICING IN CONNECTION WITH CAPS ON INTERCHANGE FEES. IN SOME CASES, REGULATIONS ALSO EXTEND TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS.  BROAD REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OVER PAYMENT SYSTEMS CAN ALSO INCLUDE, IN SOME CASES, REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNATIONAL CARD NETWORKS TO LOCALIZE ASPECTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS, SUCH AS PROCESSING INFRASTRUCTURE AND DATA STORAGE, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND DIMINISH THE VALUE OF OUR CLOSED LOOP. THE DEVELOPMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF PAYMENT SYSTEM REGULATORY REGIMES GENERALLY CONTINUE TO GROW AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AND MAINTAIN AND EXTEND OUR GLOBAL NETWORK.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON PAYMENTS REGULATION, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  SURCHARGING  IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES, SUCH AS CERTAIN MEMBER STATES IN THE EU AND AUSTRALIA, MERCHANTS ARE PERMITTED BY LAW TO SURCHARGE CARD PURCHASES. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF A NUMBER OF STATES IN THE UNITED STATES THAT PROHIBIT SURCHARGING HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED IN LITIGATION BROUGHT BY MERCHANT GROUPS AND SOME SUCH LAWS HAVE BEEN OVERTURNED. SURCHARGING IS AN ADVERSE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US IF IT BECOMES WIDESPREAD, PARTICULARLY WHERE IT ONLY OR DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, OTHER STEERING PRACTICES THAT ARE PERMITTED BY REGULATION IN SOME COUNTRIES COULD ALSO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US IF THEY BECOME WIDESPREAD.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF SURCHARGING AND OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD IMPAIR THE CARD MEMBER EXPERIENCE, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTION OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS REGULATION  IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR MARKETING, SALE AND SERVICING OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND OUR COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS ARE SUPERVISED AND EXAMINED BY THE CFPB, WHICH HAS BROAD RULEMAKING AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OVER PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, SAVINGS AND PAYMENT SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND AUTHORITY TO PREVENT \u201cUNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE\u201d ACTS OR PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF U.S. STATES HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION, DISCLOSURE AND OTHER LAWS (IN CERTAIN CASES MORE STRINGENT THAN U.S. FEDERAL LAWS). U.S. FEDERAL LAW ALSO REGULATES ABUSIVE DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES, WHICH ALONG WITH BANKRUPTCY AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS, CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT AMOUNTS OWED TO US OR SUBJECT US TO REGULATORY SCRUTINY.  ON MAY 7, 2019, THE CFPB ISSUED PROPOSED RULES THAT WOULD SET FORTH ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THIRD-PARTY DEBT COLLECTION AGENCIES, WHICH WE USE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN FINAL RULES, IF ANY, BECOMING EFFECTIVE BEFORE 2021.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS REGULATION, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  60  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ANTITRUST LITIGATION  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND CERTAIN STATES\u2019 ATTORNEYS GENERAL BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST US IN 2010 ALLEGING THAT THE PROVISIONS IN OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM ENGAGING IN VARIOUS ACTIONS TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OUR CARD PRODUCTS VIOLATE THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. ON JUNE 25, 2018, THE SUPREME COURT FOUND IN FAVOR OF AMERICAN EXPRESS IN THAT CASE. WE CONTINUE TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND SIMILAR ANTITRUST CLAIMS INITIATED BY MERCHANTS. SEE NOTE 7 TO THE \"CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\" FOR DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CASES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ACTIONS IMPAIRING THE CARD MEMBER EXPERIENCE, OR THE RESOLUTION OF ONE OR ANY COMBINATION OF THESE MERCHANT CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF AN ADVERSE DECISION IN THE MERCHANT LITIGATIONS ON OUR BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTION OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY  REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY CONTINUES TO INCREASE WORLDWIDE. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AND CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN POLICIES THAT PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, MEET EVOLVING CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS AND SUPPORT AND ENABLE BUSINESS INNOVATION AND GROWTH. GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE US HAVE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY RISK IN RECENT YEARS AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE THE TARGET OF INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED CYBER ATTACKS, INCLUDING COMPUTER VIRUSES, MALICIOUS OR DESTRUCTIVE CODE, RANSOMWARE, SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS (INCLUDING PHISHING, IMPERSONATION AND IDENTITY TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS), HACKING, WEBSITE DEFACEMENT, DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS AND OTHER ATTACKS AND SIMILAR DISRUPTIONS FROM THE MISCONFIGURATION OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OR ACCESS TO COMPUTER SYSTEMS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY REGULATION AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF A MAJOR INFORMATION OR CYBER SECURITY INCIDENT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  REFER TO THE RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS SECTION OF NOTE 1 TO THE \u201cCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\u201d  GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY  ADJUSTED NET INTEREST INCOME  \u2014 A NON-GAAP MEASURE THAT REPRESENTS NET INTEREST INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR CARD MEMBER LOANS (WHICH INCLUDES, ON A GAAP BASIS, INTEREST THAT IS DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE), EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR CARD MEMBER LOANS. WE BELIEVE ADJUSTED NET INTEREST INCOME IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS THE INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR CARD MEMBER LOAN PORTFOLIO AND IT IS A COMPONENT OF NET INTEREST YIELD ON AVERAGE CARD MEMBER LOANS.  ASSET SECURITIZATIONS  \u2014 ASSET SECURITIZATION INVOLVES THE TRANSFER AND SALE OF LOANS OR RECEIVABLES TO A SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY CREATED FOR THE SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY, TYPICALLY A TRUST. THE TRUST, IN TURN, ISSUES SECURITIES, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES THAT ARE SECURED BY THE TRANSFERRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES. THE TRUST USES THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SUCH SECURITIES TO PAY THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE UNDERLYING LOANS OR RECEIVABLES. THE LOANS AND RECEIVABLES OF OUR LENDING TRUST AND CHARGE TRUST (COLLECTIVELY, THE TRUSTS) SECURITIZED ARE REPORTED AS ASSETS AND THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUSTS ARE REPORTED AS LIABILITIES ON OUR \u201cCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.\u201d  AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE \u2014  THIS CALCULATION IS GENERALLY DESIGNED TO REFLECT THE AVERAGE PRICING AT ALL MERCHANTS ACCEPTING AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AND REPRESENTS THE PERCENTAGE OF PROPRIETARY AND GNS BILLED BUSINESS RETAINED BY US FROM MERCHANTS WE ACQUIRE, OR FROM MERCHANTS ACQUIRED BY THIRD PARTIES ON OUR BEHALF, NET OF AMOUNTS RETAINED BY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.  BILLED BUSINESS  \u2014 REPRESENTS TRANSACTION VOLUMES (INCLUDING CASH ADVANCES) ON CARDS AND OTHER PAYMENT PRODUCTS ISSUED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS (PROPRIETARY BILLED BUSINESS) AND CARDS ISSUED UNDER NETWORK PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS WITH BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING JOINT VENTURES (GNS BILLED BUSINESS).  IN-STORE SPENDING ACTIVITY WITHIN GNS RETAIL COBRAND PORTFOLIOS, FROM WHICH WE EARN NO REVENUE, IS NOT INCLUDED IN BILLED BUSINESS.  BILLED BUSINESS IS REPORTED AS IN THE UNITED STATES OR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES BASED ON THE LOCATION OF THE ISSUER.  61  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CAPITAL RATIOS  \u2014 REPRESENTS THE MINIMUM STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE REGULATORY AGENCIES AS A MEASURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE REGULATED ENTITY HAS SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ABSORB ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET LOSSES BEYOND CURRENT LOSS ACCRUAL ESTIMATES. REFER TO THE \u201cCAPITAL STRATEGY\u201d SECTION UNDER \u201cCONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\u201d FOR FURTHER RELATED DEFINITIONS UNDER BASEL III.  CARDS-IN-FORCE  \u2014 REPRESENTS THE NUMBER OF CARDS THAT ARE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING BY AMERICAN EXPRESS (PROPRIETARY CARDS-IN-FORCE) AND CARDS ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING UNDER NETWORK PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS WITH BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING JOINT VENTURES (GNS CARDS-IN-FORCE), EXCEPT FOR GNS RETAIL COBRAND CARDS THAT HAD NO OUT-OF-STORE SPENDING ACTIVITY DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS.  BASIC CARDS-IN-FORCE  EXCLUDES SUPPLEMENTAL CARDS ISSUED ON CONSUMER ACCOUNTS.  CARD MEMBER  \u2014 THE INDIVIDUAL HOLDER OF AN ISSUED AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CHARGE, CREDIT AND CERTAIN PREPAID CARDS.  CARD MEMBER LOANS  \u2014 REPRESENTS THE OUTSTANDING AMOUNT DUE FROM CARD MEMBERS FOR CHARGES MADE ON THEIR AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CARDS, AS WELL AS ANY INTEREST CHARGES AND CARD-RELATED FEES. CARD MEMBER LOANS ALSO INCLUDE REVOLVING BALANCES ON CERTAIN AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE CARD PRODUCTS.  CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES  \u2014 REPRESENTS THE OUTSTANDING AMOUNT DUE FROM CARD MEMBERS FOR CHARGES MADE ON THEIR AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE CARDS, AS WELL AS ANY CARD-RELATED FEES, OTHER THAN REVOLVING BALANCES ON CERTAIN AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE CARDS WITH PAY OVER TIME FEATURES. SUCH REVOLVING BALANCES ARE INCLUDED WITHIN CARD MEMBER LOANS.  CHARGE CARDS  \u2014 REPRESENTS CARDS THAT GENERALLY CARRY NO PRE-SET SPENDING LIMITS AND ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED AS A METHOD OF PAYMENT AND NOT AS A MEANS OF FINANCING PURCHASES. CHARGE CARD MEMBERS GENERALLY MUST PAY THE FULL AMOUNT BILLED EACH MONTH. NO FINANCE CHARGES ARE ASSESSED ON CHARGE CARDS. EACH CHARGE CARD TRANSACTION IS AUTHORIZED BASED ON ITS LIKELY ECONOMICS REFLECTING A CARD MEMBER\u2019S MOST RECENT CREDIT INFORMATION AND SPEND PATTERNS. SOME CHARGE CARD ACCOUNTS HAVE ADDITIONAL PAY OVER TIME FEATURE(S) THAT ALLOW REVOLVING OF CERTAIN CHARGES.  COBRAND CARDS  \u2014 CARDS ISSUED UNDER COBRAND AGREEMENTS WITH SELECTED COMMERCIAL FIRMS. PURSUANT TO THE COBRAND AGREEMENTS, WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR COBRAND PARTNERS, WHICH CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, BASED PRIMARILY ON THE AMOUNT OF CARD MEMBER SPENDING AND CORRESPONDING REWARDS EARNED ON SUCH SPENDING AND, UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED. THE PARTNER IS THEN LIABLE FOR PROVIDING REWARDS TO THE CARD MEMBER UNDER THE COBRAND PARTNER\u2019S OWN LOYALTY PROGRAM.  CREDIT CARDS  \u2014 REPRESENTS CARDS THAT HAVE A RANGE OF REVOLVING PAYMENT TERMS, GRACE PERIODS, AND RATE AND FEE STRUCTURES.  DISCOUNT REVENUE  \u2014 PRIMARILY REPRESENTS REVENUE EARNED FROM FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHO HAVE ENTERED INTO A CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT. THE DISCOUNT FEE IS GENERALLY DEDUCTED FROM OUR PAYMENT FOR CARD MEMBER PURCHASES.  INTEREST EXPENSE  \u2014 INCLUDES INTEREST INCURRED PRIMARILY TO FUND CARD MEMBER LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES AND LIQUIDITY NEEDS, AND IS RECOGNIZED AS INCURRED. INTEREST EXPENSE IS DIVIDED PRINCIPALLY INTO TWO CATEGORIES: (I) DEPOSITS, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATES TO INTEREST EXPENSE ON DEPOSITS TAKEN FROM CUSTOMERS AND INSTITUTIONS, AND (II) DEBT, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATES TO INTEREST EXPENSE ON OUR LONG-TERM FINANCING AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, (E.G., COMMERCIAL PAPER, FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED, BANK OVERDRAFTS AND OTHER SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS), AS WELL AS THE REALIZED IMPACT OF DERIVATIVES HEDGING INTEREST RATE RISK ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT.  INTEREST INCOME  \u2014 INCLUDES (I) INTEREST ON LOANS, (II) INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND (III) INTEREST INCOME ON DEPOSITS WITH BANKS AND OTHER.  INTEREST ON LOANS  \u2014 ASSESSED USING THE AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE METHOD FOR CARD MEMBER LOANS. UNLESS THE LOAN IS CLASSIFIED AS NON-ACCRUAL, INTEREST IS RECOGNIZED BASED UPON THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNT AGREEMENT UNTIL THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE IS PAID OR WRITTEN OFF.  INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES  \u2014 PRIMARILY RELATES TO OUR PERFORMING FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. INTEREST INCOME IS RECOGNIZED AS EARNED USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD, WHICH ADJUSTS THE YIELD FOR SECURITY PREMIUMS AND DISCOUNTS, FEES AND OTHER PAYMENTS, SO A CONSTANT RATE OF RETURN IS RECOGNIZED ON THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE RELATED INVESTMENT SECURITY THROUGHOUT ITS TERM. AMOUNTS ARE RECOGNIZED UNTIL SECURITIES ARE IN DEFAULT OR WHEN IT IS LIKELY THAT FUTURE INTEREST PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE MADE AS SCHEDULED.  62  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST INCOME ON DEPOSITS WITH BANKS AND OTHER  \u2014 RECOGNIZED AS EARNED, AND PRIMARILY RELATES TO THE PLACEMENT OF CASH IN EXCESS OF NEAR-TERM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS IN INTEREST-BEARING TIME DEPOSITS, OVERNIGHT SWEEP ACCOUNTS, AND OTHER INTEREST-BEARING DEMAND AND CALL ACCOUNTS.  LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO  \u2014  REPRESENTS THE MINIMUM STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE REGULATORY AGENCIES AS A MEASURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE REGULATED ENTITY HAS SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN PERIODS OF FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC STRESS.  MERCHANT ACQUISITION  \u2014 REPRESENTS OUR PROCESS OF ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS.  NET CARD FEES  \u2014 REPRESENTS THE CARD MEMBERSHIP FEES EARNED DURING THE PERIOD. THESE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE OVER THE COVERED CARD MEMBERSHIP PERIOD (TYPICALLY ONE YEAR), NET OF THE PROVISION FOR PROJECTED REFUNDS FOR CARD MEMBERSHIP CANCELLATION AND DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS.  NET INTEREST YIELD ON AVERAGE CARD MEMBER LOANS \u2014  A NON-GAAP MEASURE THAT IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING ADJUSTED NET INTEREST INCOME BY AVERAGE CARD MEMBER LOANS, COMPUTED ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. RESERVES AND NET WRITE-OFFS RELATED TO UNCOLLECTIBLE INTEREST ARE RECORDED THROUGH PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES, AND ARE THUS NOT INCLUDED IN THE NET INTEREST YIELD CALCULATION. WE BELIEVE NET INTEREST YIELD ON AVERAGE CARD MEMBER LOANS IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A MEASURE OF PROFITABILITY OF OUR CARD MEMBER LOAN PORTFOLIO.  NET LOSS RATIO  \u2014 REPRESENTS THE RATIO OF GCP CHARGE CARD WRITE-OFFS, CONSISTING OF PRINCIPAL (RESULTING FROM AUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS) AND FEE COMPONENTS, LESS RECOVERIES, ON CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS AMOUNTS BILLED TO CORPORATE CARD MEMBERS.  NET WRITE-OFF RATE  \u2014  PRINCIPAL ONLY  \u2014 REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF PROPRIETARY CONSUMER OR SMALL BUSINESS CARD MEMBER LOANS OR RECEIVABLES WRITTEN OFF, CONSISTING OF PRINCIPAL (RESULTING FROM AUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS), LESS RECOVERIES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE AVERAGE LOAN OR RECEIVABLES BALANCE DURING THE PERIOD.  NET WRITE-OFF RATE  \u2014  PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND FEES  \u2014 INCLUDES, IN THE CALCULATION OF THE NET WRITE-OFF RATE, AMOUNTS FOR INTEREST AND FEES IN ADDITION TO PRINCIPAL FOR CARD MEMBER LOANS AND FEES IN ADDITION TO PRINCIPAL FOR CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES.  OPERATING EXPENSES  \u2014 REPRESENTS SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER EXPENSES.  RETURN ON AVERAGE EQUITY  \u2014 CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ONE-YEAR PERIOD NET INCOME BY ONE-YEAR AVERAGE TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY.  63  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "AMERICAN EXPRESS CO", "CIK": 4962, "Date": "2019-07-23T00:00:00", "Ticker": "AXP", "Name": "American Express Co", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 6199.0, "Business": "NY", "Incorporated": "NY", "IRS": 134922250.0, "key": "20190723AXP", "labelr1": -0.1950078003120014, "labelr2": -0.6252442360296969, "labelr3": -0.2909948879276481, "labelr4": 0.3233948572329994, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.19628176, "prof1": 0.8037181999999999, "return1&2": 0.9918096723868955, "return1&2&3": 0.9889235569422776, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9921216848673948, "return2": 0.993747557639703, "return1": 0.99804992199688, "return3": 0.9970900511207236, "return4": 1.00323394857233, "1_day_return": -0.19500780031199705, "cumulative_return1": 0.4006156055656156, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.12237270398150647, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.007156479250231503, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0039306343655434815, "indexx": 1357, "cumreturn1b": 0.8536338068812104, "cumreturndow": 1.0156575486942272, "cumreturnsp500": 1.01804221428819}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1373, "level_0": 3086, "index": 88404, "text": "ITEM 2.

PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT, WE PAID CASH IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $85 MILLION TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND OPTION HOLDERS OF BORO. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED WAS $434.8 MILLION, INCLUDING $326.6 MILLION IN LOANS, WHILE THE FAIR VALUE OF LIABILITIES ASSUMED WAS $389.4 MILLION, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF $376.4 MILLION IN DEPOSITS. THE OPERATIONS OF BORO WERE INCLUDED IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS BEGINNING AUGUST 1, 2018. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLE ASSET ACQUIRED AS OF AUGUST 1, 2018 WAS $10.0 MILLION AND RESULTING GOODWILL WAS $39.6 MILLION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, WE MERGED BORO INTO THE BANK, AND ALL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS WERE CONVERTED TO THE PLAINSCAPITAL BANK PLATFORM.  \u200b  TERMINATION OF FDIC LOSS-SHARE AGREEMENTS  \u200b  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, THE BANK TERMINATED ITS LOSS-SHARE AGREEMENTS WITH THE FDIC WHICH WERE ENTERED INTO IN CONNECTION WITH THE FNB TRANSACTION, RESULTING IN A $6.26 MILLION PAYMENT FROM THE FDIC TO THE BANK. PRIOR TO THE TERMINATION, THE BANK RECORDED \u201cTRUE-UP\u201d ACCRUALS OF $0.1 MILLION AND $0.3 MILLION DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WITH RESPECT TO THE FDIC-ASSISTED TRANSACTION WHEREBY THE BANK ACQUIRED CERTAIN ASSETS AND ASSUMED CERTAIN LIABILITIES OF EDINBURG, TEXAS-BASED FIRST NATIONAL BANK (\u201cFNB\u201d) ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2013 (THE \u201cFNB TRANSACTION\u201d). THE TRUE-UP ACCRUAL WAS BASED ON A FORMULA WITHIN THE LOSS-SHARE AGREEMENTS, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE AGREED TO REIMBURSE THE FDIC IF ACTUAL LOSSES INCURRED AND BILLED TO THE FDIC THROUGH LOSS SHARING WERE BELOW A STATED THRESHOLD. DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, THE BANK ALSO RECORDED $1.9 MILLION AND $5.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF AMORTIZATION OF EXCESS BOOK VALUE OF ITS RECEIVABLES UNDER THE LOSS-SHARE AGREEMENTS (THE \u201cFDIC INDEMNIFICATION ASSET\u201d) DUE TO LOWER PROJECTED COLLECTIONS FROM THE FDIC THAN WERE INITIALLY ESTIMATED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE.  \u200b  SEGMENT INFORMATION  \u200b  WE HAVE THREE PRIMARY BUSINESS UNITS, PCC (BANKING AND MORTGAGE ORIGINATION), SECURITIES HOLDINGS (BROKER-DEALER) AND NLC (INSURANCE). UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cGAAP\u201d), OUR BUSINESS UNITS ARE COMPRISED OF FOUR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS ORGANIZED PRIMARILY BY THE CORE PRODUCTS OFFERED TO THE SEGMENTS\u2019 RESPECTIVE CUSTOMERS: BANKING, BROKER-DEALER, MORTGAGE ORIGINATION AND INSURANCE. CONSISTENT WITH OUR HISTORICAL SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS, WE ANTICIPATE THAT FUTURE REVENUES WILL BE DRIVEN PRIMARILY FROM THE BANKING SEGMENT, WITH THE REMAINDER BEING GENERATED BY OUR BROKER-DEALER, MORTGAGE ORIGINATION AND INSURANCE SEGMENTS. OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN MORE VOLATILE THAN OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE BANKING, BROKER-DEALER AND INSURANCE SEGMENTS.  \u200b  THE BANKING SEGMENT INCLUDES THE OPERATIONS OF THE BANK, AND SINCE AUGUST 1, 2018, THE OPERATIONS ACQUIRED IN THE BORO ACQUISITION. THE BANKING SEGMENT PRIMARILY PROVIDES BUSINESS AND CONSUMER BANKING SERVICES FROM OFFICES LOCATED THROUGHOUT TEXAS AND GENERATES REVENUE FROM ITS PORTFOLIO OF EARNING ASSETS. THE BANK\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE PRIMARILY DEPENDENT ON NET INTEREST INCOME.

THE BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT GENERATES A MAJORITY OF ITS REVENUES FROM FEES AND COMMISSIONS EARNED FROM INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND SECURITIES BROKERAGE SERVICES. HILLTOP SECURITIES IS A BROKER-DEALER REGISTERED WITH THE SEC AND THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY (\u201cFINRA\u201d) AND A MEMBER OF THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (\u201cNYSE\u201d).

HOW WE GENERATE REVENUE  \u200b  WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM NET INTEREST INCOME AND FROM NONINTEREST INCOME. NET INTEREST INCOME REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INCOME EARNED ON OUR ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR LOANS AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES, AND OUR COST OF FUNDS, INCLUDING THE INTEREST PAID ON THE DEPOSITS AND BORROWINGS THAT ARE USED TO SUPPORT OUR ASSETS. NET INTEREST INCOME IS A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND IS PRIMARILY EARNED BY OUR BANKING SEGMENT. FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, AS WELL AS THE AMOUNTS AND TYPES OF INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS AND INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES WE HOLD, AFFECT NET INTEREST INCOME. NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE WITHIN OUR BANKING SEGMENT AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT WITHIN CORPORATE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES WITHIN OUR MORTGAGE ORIGINATION, BROKER-DEALER AND INSURANCE SEGMENTS.  \u200b  THE OTHER COMPONENT OF OUR REVENUE IS NONINTEREST INCOME, WHICH IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF THE FOLLOWING.  \u200b  (I)  INCOME FROM BROKER-DEALER OPERATIONS.  THROUGH SECURITIES HOLDINGS, WE PROVIDE INVESTMENT BANKING AND OTHER RELATED FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE GENERATED $113.1 MILLION AND $117.3 MILLION IN SECURITIES COMMISSIONS AND FEES AND INVESTMENT AND SECURITIES ADVISORY FEES AND COMMISSIONS, AND $77.1 MILLION AND $17.2 MILLION IN GAINS FROM DERIVATIVE AND TRADING PORTFOLIO ACTIVITIES (INCLUDED WITHIN OTHER NONINTEREST INCOME), DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  \u200b  (II)  INCOME FROM MORTGAGE OPERATIONS.  THROUGH PRIMELENDING, WE GENERATE NONINTEREST INCOME BY ORIGINATING AND SELLING MORTGAGE LOANS. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, WE GENERATED $282.6 MILLION AND $288.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN NET GAINS FROM THE SALE OF LOANS, OTHER MORTGAGE PRODUCTION INCOME (INCLUDING INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH RETAINED MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS), AND MORTGAGE LOAN ORIGINATION FEES.  \u200b  (III)  INCOME FROM INSURANCE OPERATIONS.  THROUGH NLC, WE PROVIDE FIRE AND LIMITED HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE FOR LOW VALUE DWELLINGS AND MANUFACTURED HOMES. WE GENERATED $66.7 MILLION AND $68.4 MILLION IN NET INSURANCE PREMIUMS EARNED DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  \u200b  THE INCREASE IN NONINTEREST INCOME NOTED IN THE SEGMENT RESULTS TABLE PREVIOUSLY PRESENTED WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $59.9 MILLION IN GAINS FROM DERIVATIVE AND TRADING PORTFOLIO ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY WITHIN OUR BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $10.9 MILLION IN NET GAINS FROM SALE OF LOANS AND OTHER MORTGAGE PRODUCTION INCOME WITHIN OUR MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT.  \u200b  WE ALSO INCUR NONINTEREST EXPENSES IN THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESSES. OUR BUSINESSES ENGAGE IN LABOR INTENSIVE ACTIVITIES AND, CONSEQUENTLY, EMPLOYEES\u2019 COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF OUR NONINTEREST EXPENSES.  \u200b  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS  \u200b  NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS $57.8 MILLION, OR $0.62 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED WITH NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF $33.1 MILLION, OR $0.35 PER DILUTED SHARE, DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS $96.6 MILLION, OR $1.03 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED WITH NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF $57.5 MILLION, OR $0.60 PER DILUTED SHARE, DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 INCLUDED COSTS INCURRED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT LEADERSHIP CHANGES AND OTHER EFFICIENCY INITIATIVE-RELATED CHARGES WHICH, IN THE AGGREGATE, TOTALED $8.7 MILLION BEFORE INCOME TAXES.  \u200b  58  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CERTAIN ITEMS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018 RESULTED FROM PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER OF PLAINSCAPITAL CORPORATION WITH AND INTO A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF HILLTOP ON NOVEMBER 30, 2012 (THE \u201cPLAINSCAPITAL MERGER\u201d), THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (\u201cFDIC\u201d) -ASSISTED TRANSACTION (THE \u201cFNB TRANSACTION\u201d) WHEREBY THE BANK ACQUIRED CERTAIN ASSETS AND ASSUMED CERTAIN LIABILITIES OF FNB, THE ACQUISITION OF SWS GROUP, INC.

ACCRETION OF DISCOUNT ON LOANS IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO DECREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS AS LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE BANK TRANSACTIONS ARE REPAID, REFINANCED OR RENEWED. CHANGES IN THE VOLUME OF INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AS A RESULT OF THE BORO ACQUISITION AND SEASONAL INCREASES IN MORTGAGE WAREHOUSE LENDING VOLUME, INCREASED TAXABLE EQUIVALENT NET INTEREST INCOME DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018. CHANGES IN RATES PAID ON INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES DECREASED TAXABLE EQUIVALENT NET INTEREST INCOME DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, DUE TO INCREASES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES. OUR PORTFOLIO INCLUDES LOANS THAT PERIODICALLY REPRICE OR MATURE PRIOR TO THE END OF AN AMORTIZED TERM. SOME OF OUR VARIABLE-RATE LOANS REMAIN AT APPLICABLE RATE FLOORS, WHICH MAY DELAY AND/OR LIMIT CHANGES IN INTEREST INCOME DURING A PERIOD OF CHANGING RATES. IF INTEREST RATES WERE TO FALL, THE IMPACT ON OUR INTEREST INCOME FOR CERTAIN VARIABLE-RATE LOANS WOULD BE LIMITED BY THESE RATE FLOORS. IN ADDITION, DECLINING INTEREST RATES MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS ON DEPOSITS. THE EXTENT OF THIS IMPACT WILL ULTIMATELY BE DRIVEN BY THE TIMING, MAGNITUDE AND FREQUENCY OF INTEREST RATE AND YIELD CURVE MOVEMENTS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS AND TIMING OF MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. IF INTEREST RATES WERE TO RISE, YIELDS ON THE PORTION OF OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO THAT REMAIN AT APPLICABLE RATE FLOORS WOULD RISE MORE SLOWLY THAN INCREASES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES. ANY CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ACROSS THE TERM STRUCTURE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN. THE IMPACT OF RATE MOVEMENTS WILL CHANGE WITH THE SHAPE OF THE YIELD CURVE, INCLUDING ANY CHANGES IN STEEPNESS OR FLATNESS AND INVERSIONS AT ANY POINTS ON THE YIELD CURVE.  65  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u200b  THE BANKING SEGMENT\u2019S NONINTEREST INCOME INCREASED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES IN SERVICE CHARGE INCOME DUE TO THE RESTRUCTURING OF OUR PRODUCTS.  \u200b  THE BANKING SEGMENT\u2019S NONINTEREST EXPENSES DECREASED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN NET EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUSLY COVERED ASSETS, INCLUDING THE FDIC INDEMNIFICATION ASSET DISCUSSED IN THE \u201cFACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d SECTION ABOVE. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, THE BANK WAS THE VICTIM OF A \u201cSPEAR PHISHING\u201d ATTACK WHICH RESULTED IN A WIRE FRAUD LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $4.0 MILLION AND APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION OF OTHER RELATED EXPENSES.

THE INCREASES IN TRADING GAINS DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO A MORE FAVORABLE MARKET ENVIRONMENT RESULTING IN 10% AND 17% RESPECTIVE INCREASES IN TRADING VOLUMES, ENHANCED SPREADS AND 25% AND 18% RESPECTIVE INCREASES IN THE STRUCTURED FINANCE BUSINESS LINE\u2019S TO-BE-ANNOUNCED (\u201cTBA\u201d) MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES VOLUME. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A MORE ROBUST BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN 2019 THAN WE OBSERVED IN 2018 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF RECENT DECREASES IN INTEREST RATES (SEE OTHER NONINTEREST INCOME DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS), INCREASED CUSTOMER DEMAND, IMPROVED PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION, AND OTHER STRATEGIC ENHANCEMENTS. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY $18.8 MILLION AND $28.8 MILLION RESPECTIVE INCREASES IN VARIABLE COMPENSATION BASED ON MORE ROBUST FINANCIAL RESULTS AND, WITH RESPECT TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE $2.2 MILLION IN PRE-TAX COSTS RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 ASSOCIATED WITH LEADERSHIP CHANGES AS NOTED IN THE \u201cFACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d SECTION ABOVE.  \u200b  THE BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT IS SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK AS A CONSEQUENCE OF MAINTAINING INVENTORY POSITIONS, TRADING IN INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND MAINTAINING A MATCHED STOCK LOAN BOOK. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON OUR OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. OUR BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT HAS HISTORICALLY EARNED A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS REVENUES FROM ADVISORY FEES UPON THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF CLIENT TRANSACTIONS. RAPID OR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT\u2019S BOND TRADING, SALES, UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER INTEREST SPREAD-SENSITIVE ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED BELOW. THE BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT ALSO RECEIVES ADMINISTRATIVE FEES FOR PROVIDING MONEY MARKET AND FDIC INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES TO CLIENTS, WHICH TEND TO BE SENSITIVE TO SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES. IN ADDITION, THE PROFITABILITY OF THE BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT DEPENDS, TO AN EXTENT, ON THE SPREAD BETWEEN REVENUES EARNED ON CUSTOMER LOANS AND EXCESS CUSTOMER CASH BALANCES, AND THE INTEREST EXPENSE PAID ON CUSTOMER CASH BALANCES, AS WELL AS THE INTEREST REVENUE EARNED ON TRADING SECURITIES, NET OF FINANCING COSTS.  \u200b  IN THE BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT, INTEREST IS EARNED FROM SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES, INTEREST CHARGED ON CUSTOMER MARGIN LOAN BALANCES AND INTEREST EARNED ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES USED TO SUPPORT SALES, UNDERWRITING AND OTHER CUSTOMER ACTIVITIES. NET INTEREST INCOME DECREASED BETWEEN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, AND THE COMPARABLE PERIODS IN 2018, RESULTING FROM DECREASES IN NET INTEREST INCOME FROM OUR STRUCTURED FINANCE OPERATIONS DUE TO A DECLINE IN POOL INVENTORY FROM JUNE 30, 2018 TO JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECREASES IN NET INTEREST INCOME FROM THE SEGMENT\u2019S STOCK LENDING ACTIVITIES DUE TO 15% AND 13% RESPECTIVE DECREASES IN AVERAGE STOCK LENDING BALANCES. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN NET INTEREST EARNED ON TRADING SECURITIES.  \u200b  NONINTEREST INCOME INCREASED BETWEEN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, AND THE COMPARABLE PERIODS IN 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN OTHER NONINTEREST INCOME AND INVESTMENT AND SECURITIES ADVISORY FEES AND COMMISSIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN SECURITIES COMMISSIONS AND FEES.  \u200b  SECURITIES COMMISSIONS AND FEES DECREASED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN COMMISSIONS EARNED ON MUNICIPAL BOND, OVER-THE-COUNTER SECURITIES AND INSURANCE TRANSACTIONS.  \u200b  INVESTMENT AND SECURITIES ADVISORY FEES AND COMMISSIONS INCREASED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED TRADING VOLUMES.  \u200b  OTHER NONINTEREST INCOME INCREASED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF $35.5 MILLION AND $59.9 MILLION RESPECTIVE INCREASES IN TRADING GAINS EARNED FROM OUR DERIVATIVE AND TRADING PORTFOLIO ACTIVITIES, MOST NOTABLY IN OUR STRUCTURED FINANCE BUSINESS, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR $32.5 MILLION AND $51.6 MILLION OF THE RESPECTIVE INCREASES, WHILE OUR CAPITAL MARKETS BUSINESS ACCOUNTED FOR $2.8 MILLION AND $8.2 MILLION OF THE RESPECTIVE INCREASES. THE $32.5 MILLION AND $51.6 MILLION INCREASES IN OUR STRUCTURED FINANCE BUSINESS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 41 AND 69 RESPECTIVE BASIS-POINT DECLINES IN THE 10-YEAR TREASURY BOND YIELD DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 11 AND 45 RESPECTIVE BASIS-POINT INCREASES DURING THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, AND 25% AND 18% RESPECTIVE INCREASES IN THE TBA MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES VOLUME. THE $2.8 MILLION AND $8.2 MILLION RESPECTIVE INCREASES IN OUR CAPITAL MARKETS BUSINESS IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN IMPROVED MARKET ENVIRONMENT, IMPROVED SPREADS AND 10% AND 17% RESPECTIVE INCREASES IN TRADING VOLUME.  \u200b  NONINTEREST EXPENSES INCREASED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND, WITH RESPECT TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE  67  TABLE OF CONTENTS  $2.2 MILLION IN PRE-TAX COSTS RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 ASSOCIATED WITH LEADERSHIP CHANGES AS NOTED IN THE \u201cFACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d SECTION ABOVE.  \u200b  SELECTED INFORMATION CONCERNING THE BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT FOLLOWS (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  \u200b  \u200b  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  \u200b  \u200b  2019  \u200b  2018  \u200b  2019  \u200b  2018  \u200b  TOTAL COMPENSATION AS A % OF NET REVENUE  \u200b  60.1%  \u200b  60.6%  \u200b  \u200b  60.3%  \u200b  62.5%  FDIC INSURED PROGRAM BALANCES AT THE BANK (END OF PERIOD)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  $1,304,744  \u200b  $1,278,694  \u200b  OTHER FDIC INSURED PROGRAM BALANCES (END OF PERIOD)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  $675,621  \u200b  $896,739  \u200b  CUSTOMER MARGIN BALANCES (END OF PERIOD)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  $336,729  \u200b  $355,561  \u200b  CUSTOMER FUNDS ON DEPOSIT, INCLUDING SHORT CREDITS (END OF PERIOD)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  $325,427  \u200b  $354,277  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  PUBLIC BANKING.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  NUMBER OF ISSUES  \u200b  350  \u200b  \u200b  368  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  563  \u200b  \u200b  604  \u200b  AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF OFFERINGS  $14,347,624  \u200b  $15,066,403  \u200b  \u200b  $26,139,362  \u200b  $25,715,524  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  CAPITAL MARKETS.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  TOTAL VOLUMES  $22,570,905  \u200b  $20,505,462  \u200b  \u200b  $42,602,822  \u200b  $36,376,727  \u200b  NET INVENTORY (END OF PERIOD)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  $553,586  \u200b  $376,388  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  RETAIL.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  RETAIL EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES (END OF PERIOD)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  124  \u200b  \u200b  124  \u200b  INDEPENDENT REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES (END OF PERIOD)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  203  \u200b  \u200b  218  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  STRUCTURED FINANCE.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  LOCK PRODUCTION/TBA VOLUME  $1,650,597  \u200b  $1,318,084  \u200b  \u200b  $2,798,811  \u200b  $2,379,596  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  CLEARING.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  TOTAL TICKETS  \u200b  509,546  \u200b  \u200b  373,385  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  1,014,767  \u200b  \u200b  779,516  \u200b  CORRESPONDENTS (END OF PERIOD)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  148  \u200b  \u200b  152  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  SECURITIES LENDING.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS -

HISTORICALLY, THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT HAS TYPICALLY EXPERIENCED INCREASED LOAN ORIGINATION VOLUME FROM PURCHASES OF HOMES DURING THE SPRING AND SUMMER, WHEN MORE PEOPLE TEND TO MOVE AND BUY OR SELL HOMES. AN INCREASE IN MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES TENDS TO RESULT IN DECREASED LOAN ORIGINATION VOLUME FROM REFINANCINGS, WHILE A DECREASE IN MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES TENDS TO RESULT IN INCREASED LOAN ORIGINATION VOLUME FROM REFINANCINGS. AS AVERAGE MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES HAVE DECREASED BETWEEN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 AND THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN 2019, REFINANCING VOLUME AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ORIGINATION VOLUME HAS INCREASED FROM 12.0% TO 15.9%. REFINANCING VOLUME AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ORIGINATION VOLUME FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN 2018 WAS RELATIVELY FLAT AT APPROXIMATELY 16%. CHANGES IN MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD A LESSER IMPACT ON HOME PURCHASES VOLUME THAN ON REFINANCING VOLUME. WE ANTICIPATE THAT RECENT DECREASES IN MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES WILL INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF REFINANCING VOLUMES RELATIVE TO TOTAL LOAN ORIGINATION VOLUME FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  \u200b  THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT PRIMARILY ORIGINATES ITS MORTGAGE LOANS THROUGH A RETAIL CHANNEL, WITH LIMITED LENDING THROUGH ITS AFFILIATED BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS (\u201cABAS\u201d). FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, FUNDED VOLUME THROUGH ABAS WAS APPROXIMATELY 7% OF THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT\u2019S TOTAL LOAN VOLUME. CURRENTLY, PRIMELENDING OWNS A 51% MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN FOUR ABAS.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS INITIATIVE WAS TO BETTER ALIGN RESOURCES AND  70  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LOWER PRIMELENDING\u2019S COST STRUCTURE. THE DECREASES IN NON-VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS AND SEGMENT OPERATING COSTS DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THIS INITIATIVE. DECREASES IN NONINTEREST EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF THIS INITIATIVE HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COSTS RELATED TO THE \u201cTECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENTS AND CORPORATE INITIATIVES\u201d DISCUSSED IN DETAIL WITHIN THE \u201cOVERVIEW\u201d ABOVE.  \u200b  TOTAL EMPLOYEES\u2019 COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF NONINTEREST EXPENSES INCURRED DURING ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. SPECIFICALLY, VARIABLE COMPENSATION COMPRISED 61.5% AND 59.6% OF TOTAL EMPLOYEES\u2019 COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND 56.3% AND 55.6% DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. VARIABLE COMPENSATION, WHICH IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOAN ORIGINATION VOLUME, TENDS TO FLUCTUATE TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN LOAN ORIGINATION VOLUME BECAUSE MORTGAGE LOAN ORIGINATOR AND FULFILLMENT STAFF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS ARE STRUCTURED TO PAY AT INCREASING RATES AS HIGHER MONTHLY VOLUME TIERS ARE ACHIEVED. HOWEVER, CERTAIN OTHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS DRIVEN BY NON-MORTGAGE PRODUCTION CRITERIA MAY ALTER THIS TREND. THE DECREASES IN VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS BETWEEN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE INCENTIVE RATE PAID.  \u200b  WHILE TOTAL LOAN ORIGINATION VOLUME DECREASED 3.6% AND 9.3% FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, THE AGGREGATE NON-VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS AND SEGMENT OPERATING COSTS OF THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT DECREASED 8.1% AND 8.9%, RESPECTIVELY. THE AFOREMENTIONED DECREASES DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN NON-VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, IN ADDITION TO DECREASES IN OCCUPANCY AND ADVERTISING COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN SOFTWARE LICENSE AND MAINTENANCE FEES. IN ADDITION, DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE RELATIVELY FLAT, WHILE DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, PROFESSIONAL FEES DECREASED. THE DECREASES IN NON-VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS AND OCCUPANCY COSTS DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WERE DUE TO A REDUCTION IN FULFILLMENT AND CORPORATE STAFF AND THE CLOSURE OF CERTAIN UNDERPERFORMING BRANCHES PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM PRIMELENDING\u2019S COST REDUCTION INITIATIVE DISCUSSED ABOVE AND IMPLEMENTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.  \u200b  IN EXCHANGE FOR A HIGHER INTEREST RATE, CUSTOMERS MAY OPT TO HAVE PRIMELENDING PAY CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ORIGINATION OF THEIR MORTGAGE LOANS (\u201cLENDER PAID CLOSING COSTS\u201d). FLUCTUATIONS IN LENDER PAID CLOSING COSTS ARE NOT ALWAYS ALIGNED WITH FLUCTUATIONS IN LOAN ORIGINATION VOLUME. OTHER LOAN PRICING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE MORTGAGE LOAN INTEREST RATE, LOAN ORIGINATION FEES PAID BY THE CUSTOMER, AND A CUSTOMER\u2019S WILLINGNESS TO PAY CLOSING COSTS, MAY INFLUENCE FLUCTUATIONS IN LENDER PAID CLOSING COSTS.  \u200b  BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2010 AND JUNE 30, 2019, THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT SOLD MORTGAGE LOANS TOTALING $113.7 BILLION. THESE LOANS WERE SOLD UNDER SALES CONTRACTS THAT GENERALLY INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT HOLD THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS RELATING TO ITS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT LOANS SOLD MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS AS TO UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND THE VALIDITY OF CERTAIN BORROWER REPRESENTATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN. IN ADDITION, THE SALES CONTRACTS TYPICALLY REQUIRE THE REFUND OF PURCHASED SERVICING RIGHTS PLUS CERTAIN INVESTOR SERVICING COSTS IF A LOAN EXPERIENCES AN EARLY PAYMENT DEFAULT. WHILE THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT SOLD LOANS PRIOR TO 2010, IT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN THE FUTURE ON LOANS ORIGINATED PRIOR TO 2010 AS A RESULT OF INVESTOR CLAIMS UNDER THESE PROVISIONS OF ITS SALES CONTRACTS.  \u200b  WHEN A CLAIM FOR INDEMNIFICATION OF A LOAN SOLD IS MADE BY AN AGENCY, INVESTOR, OR OTHER PARTY, THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT EVALUATES THE CLAIM AND DETERMINES IF THE CLAIM CAN BE SATISFIED THROUGH ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER DELIVERABLES. IF THE CLAIM IS VALID AND CANNOT BE SATISFIED IN THAT MANNER, THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT NEGOTIATES WITH THE CLAIMANT TO REACH A SETTLEMENT OF THE CLAIM. SETTLEMENTS TYPICALLY RESULT IN EITHER THE REPURCHASE OF A LOAN OR REIMBURSEMENT TO THE CLAIMANT FOR LOSSES INCURRED ON THE LOAN.  \u200b  71  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT\u2019S CLAIMS RESOLUTION ACTIVITY RELATING TO LOANS SOLD BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2010 AND JUNE 30, 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  ORIGINAL  LOAN  BALANCE  \u200b  LOSS  RECOGNIZED  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b% OF  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b% OF  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  LOANS  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  LOANS  \u200b  \u200b  AMOUNT  SOLD  AMOUNT  SOLD  CLAIMS RESOLVED WITH NO PAYMENT  \u200b  $207,260  \u200b  0.18%  \u200b  $\u2014  \u200b  0.00%  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  CLAIMS RESOLVED BECAUSE OF A LOAN REPURCHASE OR PAYMENT TO AN INVESTOR FOR LOSSES INCURRED (1)  \u200b  \u200b  199,918  \u200b  0.18%  \u200b  \u200b  9,380  \u200b  0.01%  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  $407,178  \u200b  0.36%  \u200b  $9,380  \u200b  0.01%  \u200b  (1)  LOSSES INCURRED INCLUDE REFUNDED PURCHASED SERVICING RIGHTS.  \u200b  FOR EACH LOAN IT CONCLUDES ITS OBLIGATION TO A CLAIMANT IS BOTH PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT HAS ESTABLISHED A SPECIFIC CLAIMS INDEMNIFICATION LIABILITY RESERVE.

THE INCREASE IN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A LARGER INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE EQUITY SECURITIES HELD BY THE INSURANCE SEGMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN NET INSURANCE PREMIUMS EARNED, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF THE FACTORS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED.  \u200b  THE INSURANCE SEGMENT IS SUBJECT TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF SEVERE WEATHER, THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF WHICH ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. GENERALLY, THE INSURANCE SEGMENT\u2019S INSURED RISKS EXHIBIT HIGHER LOSSES IN THE SECOND AND THIRD CALENDAR QUARTERS DUE TO A SEASONAL CONCENTRATION OF WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS IN ITS PRIMARY GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS. ALTHOUGH WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES (INCLUDING HAIL, HIGH WINDS, TORNADOES, MONSOONS AND HURRICANES) CAN OCCUR IN ANY CALENDAR QUARTER, THE SECOND CALENDAR QUARTER, HISTORICALLY, HAS EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST FREQUENCY OF LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EVENTS. HURRICANES, HOWEVER, ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE THIRD CALENDAR QUARTER OF THE YEAR.  \u200b  THE INSURANCE SEGMENT PERIODICALLY REVIEWS THE PRICING OF ITS PRIMARY PRODUCTS IN EACH STATE OF OPERATION UTILIZING A CONSULTING ACTUARIAL FIRM TO SUPPLEMENT NORMAL REVIEW PROCESSES RESULTING IN FILINGS TO ADJUST RATES AS DEEMED NECESSARY. THE BENEFIT OF THESE RATE ACTIONS ARE NOT FULLY REALIZED UNTIL ALL POLICIES UNDER THE OLD RATES EXPIRE, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF RATE CHANGE IMPLEMENTATION. CONCURRENTLY, BUSINESS CONCENTRATIONS ARE REVIEWED AND ACTIONS INITIATED, INCLUDING CANCELLATION OF AGENTS, NON-RENEWAL OF POLICIES AND CESSATION OF NEW BUSINESS WRITING ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS IN PROBLEMATIC GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. THE INSURANCE SEGMENT HAS HISTORICALLY UTILIZED RATE ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE RATE OF PREMIUM GROWTH FOR TARGETED AREAS WHEN COMPARED WITH THE PATTERNS EXHIBITED IN PRIOR QUARTERS AND YEARS AND REDUCED THE INSURANCE SEGMENT\u2019S EXPOSURE TO VOLATILE WEATHER IN THESE AREAS, BUT COMPETITION AND CUSTOMER RESPONSE TO  72  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RATE INCREASES HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED CUSTOMER RETENTION AND NEW BUSINESS. THE INSURANCE SEGMENT AIMS TO MANAGE AND DIVERSIFY ITS BUSINESS CONCENTRATIONS AND PRODUCTS TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF FUTURE WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT CURRENT INITIATIVES TO EVALUATE PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND PRICING, STREAMLINE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND EXPENSES AND MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF FUTURE SIGNIFICANT WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS ARE CRITICAL TO IMPROVING THE INSURANCE SEGMENT\u2019S LONG-TERM FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.  \u200b  THE INSURANCE SEGMENT\u2019S OPERATIONS RESULTED IN COMBINED RATIOS OF 113.0% AND 111.1% DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND 99.8% AND 98.1% DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASES IN THE COMBINED RATIOS DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN THE LOSS AND LAE RATIO. THE COMBINED RATIO IS A MEASURE OF OVERALL INSURANCE UNDERWRITING PROFITABILITY, AND REPRESENTS THE SUM OF LOSS AND LAE AND UNDERWRITING EXPENSES DIVIDED BY NET INSURANCE PREMIUMS EARNED.  \u200b  NONINTEREST INCOME DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF NET INSURANCE PREMIUMS EARNED OF $33.5 MILLION AND $34.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. NONINTEREST INCOME DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF NET INSURANCE PREMIUMS EARNED OF $66.7 MILLION AND $68.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE DECREASE IN TOTAL DIRECT INSURANCE PREMIUMS WRITTEN DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, WAS DUE TO COMPETITION, RATIONALIZATION OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS, INCLUDING THE NON-RENEWAL OF COMMERCIAL POLICIES, AND CONTINUED REVIEW OF GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, IN CONNECTION WITH A STRATEGIC INITIATIVE TO FOCUS ON OUR INSURANCE SEGMENT\u2019S KEY MARKETS, WE DISCONTINUED WRITING NEW INSURANCE POLICIES IN FIVE NON-CORE STATES.

IN ADDITION, THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS USED TO MEET COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC AND TRUST DEPOSITS, SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE AND OTHER PURPOSES. THE AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND EQUITY SECURITIES PORTFOLIOS SERVE AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. HISTORICALLY, THE BANK\u2019S POLICY HAS BEEN TO INVEST PRIMARILY IN SECURITIES OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND ITS AGENCIES, OBLIGATIONS OF MUNICIPALITIES IN THE STATE OF TEXAS AND OTHER HIGH GRADE FIXED INCOME SECURITIES TO MINIMIZE CREDIT RISK. AT JUNE 30, 2019, THE BANKING SEGMENT\u2019S SECURITIES PORTFOLIO OF $1.3 BILLION WAS COMPRISED OF TRADING SECURITIES OF $2.5 MILLION, AVAILABLE FOR SALE SECURITIES OF $916.5 MILLION, EQUITY SECURITIES OF $0.1 MILLION AND HELD TO MATURITY SECURITIES OF $365.9 MILLION, IN ADDITION TO $13.3 MILLION OF OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  \u200b  BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT  \u200b  THE BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT HOLDS SECURITIES TO SUPPORT SALES, UNDERWRITING AND OTHER CUSTOMER ACTIVITIES.

THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS ARE REQUIRED TO CARRY THEIR SECURITIES AT FAIR VALUE AND RECORD CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO IN OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO OF THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS INCLUDED TRADING SECURITIES OF $599.0 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2019. IN ADDITION, THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS THAT REPRESENT COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE AND DELIVER SECURITIES AT PREVAILING FUTURE MARKET PRICES TO FACILITATE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS AND SATISFY SUCH COMMITMENTS.

THE NEW MODEL WILL REQUIRE THE MEASUREMENT OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES TO REFLECT THE LIFETIME OF AN EXPOSURE (OR POOL OF EXPOSURES) REPRESENTED BY CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO BE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT CONDITIONS AND REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE FORECASTS. UNDER THE CURRENT \u201cINCURRED LOSS\u201d MODEL, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS BASED ONLY ON ESTIMATES OF LOAN LOSSES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST IN THE PORTFOLIO AS OF THE REPORTING DATE. THE NEW MODEL WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2020, AND APPLIES TO MOST DEBT INSTRUMENTS, TRADE RECEIVABLES, LEASE RECEIVABLES, REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES, FINANCIAL GUARANTEES AND LOAN COMMITMENTS. OUR ONGOING CECL TRANSITION EFFORTS INCLUDE REASSESSING RISK RATINGS, DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING THE NEW MODEL, COLLECTING AND PROCESSING NEW DATA AND ESTABLISHING INTERNAL CONTROLS AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES. NEW MODEL DEVELOPMENT HAS INCREASED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF DATA, AND THESE INCREASES IN EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS WE PERFORM PARALLEL CALCULATIONS OF OUR ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES UNDER BOTH THE CURRENT ALLOWANCE MODEL AND UNDER THE CECL MODEL. WE EXPECT THAT THE CECL MODEL WILL REQUIRE A MATERIAL INCREASE IN OUR ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES UPON ADOPTION ON JANUARY 1, 2020.  \u200b  INSURANCE LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES  \u200b  AT JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, OUR GROSS RESERVE FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE WAS $22.3 MILLION AND $20.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING ESTIMATED RECOVERIES FROM REINSURANCE OF $1.2 MILLION AND $3.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE LIABILITY FOR INSURANCE LOSSES AND LAE REPRESENTS ESTIMATES OF THE ULTIMATE UNPAID COST OF ALL LOSSES INCURRED, INCLUDING LOSSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN REPORTED, LESS A REDUCTION FOR REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES RELATED TO THOSE LIABILITIES. SEPARATELY FOR EACH OF NLIC AND ASIC AND EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, OUR ACTUARIES ESTIMATE THE LIABILITY FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE BY FIRST ESTIMATING ULTIMATE LOSSES AND LAE AMOUNTS FOR EACH YEAR, PRIOR TO RECOGNIZING THE IMPACT OF REINSURANCE. THE AMOUNT OF LIABILITIES FOR REPORTED CLAIMS IS BASED PRIMARILY ON A CLAIM-BY-CLAIM EVALUATION OF COVERAGE, LIABILITY, INJURY SEVERITY OR SCOPE OF PROPERTY DAMAGE, AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION CONSIDERED RELEVANT TO ESTIMATING EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY THE CLAIM.  \u200b  NLC\u2019S LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID LOSSES REPRESENT THE BEST ESTIMATE AT A GIVEN POINT IN TIME OF WHAT IT EXPECTS TO PAY CLAIMANTS, BASED ON FACTS, CIRCUMSTANCES AND HISTORICAL TRENDS THEN KNOWN. DURING THE LOSS SETTLEMENT PERIOD, ADDITIONAL FACTS REGARDING INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS MAY BECOME KNOWN AND, CONSEQUENTLY, IT OFTEN BECOMES NECESSARY TO REFINE AND ADJUST THE ESTIMATES OF LIABILITY. THIS PROCESS IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS LOSS DEVELOPMENT. TO PROJECT ULTIMATE LOSSES AND LAE, OUR ACTUARIES EXAMINE THE PAID AND REPORTED LOSSES AND LAE FOR EACH ACCIDENT YEAR AND MULTIPLY THESE VALUES BY A LOSS DEVELOPMENT FACTOR. THE SELECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FACTORS ARE BASED UPON A REVIEW OF THE LOSS DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS INDICATED IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 HISTORICAL LOSS TRIANGLES (WHICH UTILIZE HISTORICAL TRENDS, ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN LOSS COSTS, UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, POLICY PROVISIONS, PRODUCT MIX AND OTHER FACTORS) AND APPLICABLE INSURANCE INDUSTRY LOSS DEVELOPMENT FACTORS. ESTIMATING THE LIABILITY FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE IS INHERENTLY JUDGMENTAL AND IS INFLUENCED BY FACTORS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VARIATION. LIABILITIES FOR LAE ARE INTENDED TO COVER THE ULTIMATE COST OF SETTLING CLAIMS, INCLUDING INVESTIGATION AND DEFENSE OF LAWSUITS RESULTING FROM SUCH CLAIMS.  \u200b  THE RESERVE ANALYSIS PERFORMED BY OUR ACTUARIES PROVIDES PRELIMINARY CENTRAL ESTIMATES OF THE UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE. AT EACH QUARTER-END, THE RESULTS OF THE RESERVE ANALYSIS ARE SUMMARIZED AND DISCUSSED WITH OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT GROUP CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF RESERVES TO RECORD FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE THE EXTENT AND TIMING OF ANY RECENT CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, HISTORICAL PATTERN AND VOLATILITY OF THE ACTUARIAL INDICATIONS, THE SENSITIVITY OF THE ACTUARIAL INDICATIONS TO CHANGES IN PAID AND REPORTED LOSS PATTERNS, THE CONSISTENCY OF CLAIMS HANDLING PROCESSES, THE CONSISTENCY OF CASE RESERVING PRACTICES, CHANGES IN OUR PRICING AND UNDERWRITING, AND OVERALL PRICING AND UNDERWRITING TRENDS IN THE INSURANCE MARKET.  \u200b  DEPOSITS  \u200b  THE BANKING SEGMENT\u2019S MAJOR SOURCE OF FUNDS AND LIQUIDITY IS ITS DEPOSIT BASE. DEPOSITS PROVIDE FUNDING FOR ITS INVESTMENTS IN LOANS AND SECURITIES. INTEREST PAID FOR DEPOSITS MUST BE MANAGED CAREFULLY TO CONTROL THE LEVEL OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND OVERALL NET INTEREST MARGIN.

THE INCREASE IN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AT JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 2018, INCLUDED AN INCREASE IN BORROWINGS IN OUR BANKING SEGMENT PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASED UTILIZATION OF AVAILABLE INTERNAL FUNDS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET DECREASE IN SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE AND SHORT-TERM BANK LOANS USED BY THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS TO FINANCE THEIR ACTIVITIES. NOTES PAYABLE AT JUNE 30, 2019, WAS COMPRISED OF $148.7 MILLION RELATED TO THE SENIOR NOTES, NET OF LOAN ORIGINATION FEES, FHLB BORROWINGS WITH AN ORIGINAL MATURITY GREATER THAN ONE YEAR WITHIN THE BANKING SEGMENT OF $4.0 MILLION, INSURANCE SEGMENT TERM NOTES OF $27.5 MILLION, AND MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT BORROWINGS OF $51.7 MILLION.  \u200b  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  \u200b  HILLTOP IS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY WHOSE ASSETS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF THE STOCK OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND INVESTED ASSETS. HILLTOP\u2019S PRIMARY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, AS A HOLDING COMPANY, ARE TO SUPPORT CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT FOR ORGANIC GROWTH AND TO PRESERVE CAPITAL TO BE DEPLOYED THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND POTENTIAL STOCK REPURCHASES. AT JUNE 30, 2019, HILLTOP HAD $67.0 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, AN INCREASE OF $23.1 MILLION FROM $43.9 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. THIS INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $71.3 MILLION OF DIVIDENDS FROM SUBSIDIARIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $25.0 MILLION OF PURCHASES UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, $15.0 MILLION IN CASH DIVIDENDS DECLARED, AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES. SUBJECT TO REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS, HILLTOP HAS RECEIVED, AND MAY ALSO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE, DIVIDENDS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES. IF NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE, WE MAY ALSO FINANCE ACQUISITIONS WITH THE PROCEEDS FROM EQUITY OR DEBT ISSUANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT HILLTOP\u2019S LIQUIDITY IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, WITH CURRENT SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS INCLUDING OPERATING EXPENSES, INTEREST ON DEBT OBLIGATIONS, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO STOCKHOLDERS AND POTENTIAL STOCK REPURCHASES.  \u200b  DIVIDEND DECLARATION  \u200b  ON JULY 25, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.08 PER COMMON SHARE, PAYABLE ON AUGUST 30, 2019 TO ALL COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON AUGUST 15, 2019.  \u200b  FUTURE DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK ARE SUBJECT TO THE DETERMINATION BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF OUR EARNINGS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES, THE GENERAL ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY CLIMATE, OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE ANY EQUITY OR DEBT OBLIGATIONS SENIOR TO OUR COMMON STOCK AND OTHER FACTORS.  82  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u200b  STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM  \u200b  IN JANUARY 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM THROUGH JANUARY 2020, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE ARE AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE, IN THE AGGREGATE, UP TO $50.0 MILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, INCLUSIVE OF REPURCHASES TO OFFSET DILUTION RELATED TO GRANTS OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED, WE MAY REPURCHASE SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS AS PERMITTED UNDER RULE 10B-18 PROMULGATED UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT. THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE REPURCHASE OUR SHARES AND THE TIMING OF SUCH REPURCHASES DEPENDS UPON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER CORPORATE CONSIDERATIONS, AS DETERMINED BY HILLTOP\u2019S MANAGEMENT TEAM. REPURCHASED SHARES WILL BE RETURNED TO OUR POOL OF AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.  \u200b  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE PAID $25.0 MILLION TO REPURCHASE AN AGGREGATE OF 1,214,843 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $20.54 PER SHARE. THE PURCHASES WERE FUNDED FROM AVAILABLE CASH BALANCES.  \u200b  SENIOR NOTES DUE 2025  \u200b  THE SENIOR NOTES BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE OF 5% PER YEAR, PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS IN CASH ON APRIL 15 AND OCTOBER 15 OF EACH YEAR, COMMENCING ON OCTOBER 15, 2015. THE SENIOR NOTES WILL MATURE ON APRIL 15, 2025, UNLESS WE REDEEM THE SENIOR NOTES, IN WHOLE AT ANY TIME OR IN PART FROM TIME TO TIME, ON OR AFTER JANUARY 15, 2025 (THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE MATURITY DATE OF THE SENIOR NOTES) AT OUR ELECTION AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST TO, BUT EXCLUDING, THE REDEMPTION DATE. AT JUNE 30, 2019, $150.0 MILLION OF OUR SENIOR NOTES WAS OUTSTANDING.  \u200b  JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES  \u200b  THE DEBENTURES HAVE A STATED TERM OF 30 YEARS WITH MATURITIES RANGING FROM JULY 2031 TO FEBRUARY 2038 WITH INTEREST PAYABLE QUARTERLY. THE RATE ON THE DEBENTURES, WHICH RESETS QUARTERLY, IS 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS AN AVERAGE SPREAD OF 3.22%. THE TOTAL AVERAGE INTEREST RATE AT JUNE 30, 2019 WAS 5.66%. THE DEBENTURES ARE CALLABLE AT PCC\u2019S DISCRETION WITH A MINIMUM OF A 45- TO 60- DAY NOTICE. AT JUNE 30, 2019, $67.0 MILLION OF PCC\u2019S DEBENTURES WERE OUTSTANDING.  \u200b  REGULATORY CAPITAL  \u200b  WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES. FAILURE TO MEET MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MAY PROMPT CERTAIN ACTIONS BY REGULATORS THAT, IF UNDERTAKEN, COULD HAVE A DIRECT MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. UNDER CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WE MUST MEET SPECIFIC CAPITAL GUIDELINES THAT INVOLVE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF OUR ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS AS CALCULATED UNDER REGULATORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. OUR CAPITAL AMOUNTS AND CLASSIFICATION ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY THE REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS.  \u200b  IN ORDER TO AVOID LIMITATIONS ON CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, STOCK REPURCHASES AND CERTAIN DISCRETIONARY BONUS PAYMENTS TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, BASEL III REQUIRES BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TO MAINTAIN A CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER ABOVE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MEASURED RELATIVE TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. THE PHASE-IN OF THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER REQUIREMENTS BEGAN ON JANUARY 1, 2016 FOR HILLTOP AND PLAINSCAPITAL, AND THE REQUIREMENTS WERE FULLY PHASED IN AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019.  \u200b  BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH LESS THAN $15 BILLION IN ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 ARE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO INCLUDE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES IN TIER 1 CAPITAL, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS. HOWEVER, IF AN INSTITUTION GROWS TO ABOVE $15 BILLION IN ASSETS AS A RESULT OF AN ACQUISITION, OR ORGANICALLY GROWS TO ABOVE $15 BILLION IN ASSETS AND THEN MAKES AN ACQUISITION, THE COMBINED TRUST PREFERRED ISSUANCES MUST BE PHASED OUT OF TIER 1 AND INTO TIER 2 CAPITAL. ALL OF THE DEBENTURES ISSUED TO THE PCC STATUTORY TRUSTS I, II, III AND IV (THE \u201cTRUSTS\u201d), LESS THE COMMON STOCK OF THE TRUSTS, QUALIFIED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, UNDER GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM.  \u200b  AT JUNE 30, 2019, HILLTOP HAD A TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS RATIO OF 17.14%, TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS RATIO OF 16.77%, COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS RATIO OF 16.32% AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AVERAGE ASSETS, OR LEVERAGE, RATIO OF 13.00%. ACCORDINGLY, HILLTOP\u2019S ACTUAL CAPITAL AMOUNTS AND RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH BASEL III EXCEEDED THE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING CONSERVATION BUFFER IN EFFECT AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.  83  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u200b  AT JUNE 30, 2019, PLAINSCAPITAL HAD A TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS RATIO OF 14.48%, TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS RATIO OF 13.84%, COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS RATIO OF 13.84% AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AVERAGE ASSETS, OR LEVERAGE, RATIO OF 12.53%. ACCORDINGLY, PLAINSCAPITAL\u2019S ACTUAL CAPITAL AMOUNTS AND RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH BASEL III RESULTED IN IT BEING CONSIDERED \u201cWELL-CAPITALIZED\u201d AND EXCEEDED THE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING CONSERVATION BUFFER IN EFFECT AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.  \u200b  WE DISCUSS REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 16 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS UNDER THE CAPTION \u201cGOVERNMENT SUPERVISION AND REGULATION \u2014 CORPORATE \u2014 CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS AND BASEL III\u201d SET FORTH IN PART I, ITEM I. OF OUR 2018 FORM 10-K.  \u200b  BANKING SEGMENT  \u200b  WITHIN OUR BANKING SEGMENT, OUR PRIMARY USES OF CASH ARE FOR CUSTOMER WITHDRAWALS AND EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT AS WELL AS OUR BORROWING COSTS AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. OUR ASSET AND LIABILITY GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTINUOUSLY MONITORING OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION TO ENSURE THAT OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MANAGED IN A MANNER THAT WILL MEET OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS. OUR GOAL IS TO MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION IN A MANNER SUCH THAT WE CAN MEET OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEPOSIT WITHDRAWALS AND ANTICIPATED AND UNANTICIPATED INCREASES IN LOAN DEMAND WITHOUT PENALIZING EARNINGS. FUNDS INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE INSTRUMENTS, THE CONTINUOUS MATURING OF OTHER INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS, CASH FLOWS FROM SELF-LIQUIDATING INVESTMENTS SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS, THE POSSIBLE SALE OF AVAILABLE FOR SALE SECURITIES AND THE ABILITY TO SECURITIZE CERTAIN TYPES OF LOANS PROVIDE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY FROM AN ASSET PERSPECTIVE. THE LIABILITY BASE PROVIDES SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY THROUGH DEPOSITS AND THE MATURITY STRUCTURE OF SHORT-TERM BORROWED FUNDS. FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS, WE UTILIZE FEDERAL FUND LINES OF CREDIT WITH CORRESPONDENT BANKS, SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE, BORROWINGS FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND BORROWINGS UNDER LINES OF CREDIT WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FOR INTERMEDIATE LIQUIDITY NEEDS, WE UTILIZE ADVANCES FROM THE FHLB. TO SUPPLY LIQUIDITY OVER THE LONGER TERM, WE HAVE ACCESS TO BROKERED TIME DEPOSITS, TERM LOANS AT THE FHLB AND BORROWINGS UNDER LINES OF CREDIT WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  \u200b  WITHIN OUR BANKING SEGMENT, DEPOSIT FLOWS ARE AFFECTED BY THE LEVEL OF MARKET INTEREST RATES, THE INTEREST RATES AND PRODUCTS OFFERED BY COMPETITORS, THE VOLATILITY OF EQUITY MARKETS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE BANK REGULARLY EVALUATES ITS DEPOSIT PRODUCTS AND PRICING STRUCTURES RELATIVE TO THE MARKET TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVENESS OVER TIME.  \u200b  THE BANK\u2019S 15 LARGEST DEPOSITORS, EXCLUDING HILLTOP AND HILLTOP SECURITIES, ACCOUNTED FOR 8.21% OF THE BANK\u2019S TOTAL DEPOSITS, AND THE BANK\u2019S FIVE LARGEST DEPOSITORS, EXCLUDING HILLTOP AND HILLTOP SECURITIES, ACCOUNTED FOR 4.37% OF THE BANK\u2019S TOTAL DEPOSITS AT JUNE 30, 2019. THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR LARGEST BANK CUSTOMERS, OR A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN OUR DEPOSIT BALANCES DUE TO ORDINARY COURSE FLUCTUATIONS RELATED TO THESE CUSTOMERS\u2019 BUSINESSES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND MIGHT REQUIRE US TO RAISE DEPOSIT RATES TO ATTRACT NEW DEPOSITS, PURCHASE FEDERAL FUNDS OR BORROW FUNDS ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS TO REPLACE SUCH DEPOSITS.  \u200b  BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT  \u200b  THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS RELY ON THEIR EQUITY CAPITAL, SHORT-TERM BANK BORROWINGS, INTEREST-BEARING AND NON-INTEREST-BEARING CLIENT CREDIT BALANCES, CORRESPONDENT DEPOSITS, SECURITIES LENDING ARRANGEMENTS, REPURCHASE AGREEMENT FINANCINGS AND OTHER PAYABLES TO FINANCE THEIR ASSETS AND OPERATIONS, SUBJECT TO THEIR RESPECTIVE COMPLIANCE WITH BROKER-DEALER NET CAPITAL AND CUSTOMER PROTECTION RULES. AT JUNE 30, 2019, HILLTOP SECURITIES HAD CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS WITH FIVE UNAFFILIATED BANKS WITH MAXIMUM AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS OF UP TO $725.0 MILLION. THESE CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS ARE USED TO FINANCE SECURITIES OWNED, SECURITIES HELD FOR CORRESPONDENT ACCOUNTS, RECEIVABLES IN CUSTOMER MARGIN ACCOUNTS AND UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES. THESE CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN \u201cAS OFFERED\u201d BASIS AND ARE NOT COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT. IN ADDITION, HILLTOP SECURITIES HAS A COMMITTED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH AN UNAFFILIATED BANK OF UP TO $50.0 MILLION. AT JUNE 30, 2019, HILLTOP SECURITIES HAD BORROWED $231.0 MILLION UNDER ITS CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AND HAD NO BORROWINGS UNDER ITS CREDIT FACILITY.  \u200b  MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT  \u200b  PRIMELENDING FUNDS THE MORTGAGE LOANS IT ORIGINATES THROUGH WAREHOUSE LINES OF CREDIT MAINTAINED WITH THE BANK WHICH HAVE AN AGGREGATE COMMITMENT OF $2.0 BILLION, OF WHICH $1.4 BILLION WAS DRAWN AT JUNE 30, 2019. PRIMELENDING SELLS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL MORTGAGE LOANS IT ORIGINATES TO VARIOUS INVESTORS IN THE SECONDARY MARKET, THE MAJORITY WITH SERVICING  84  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RELEASED. AS THESE MORTGAGE LOANS ARE SOLD IN THE SECONDARY MARKET, PRIMELENDING PAYS DOWN ITS WAREHOUSE LINE OF CREDIT WITH THE BANK. IN ADDITION, PRIMELENDING HAS AN AVAILABLE LINE OF CREDIT WITH AN UNAFFILIATED BANK OF UP TO $1.0 MILLION, OF WHICH NO BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING AT JUNE 30, 2019.  \u200b  PRIMELENDING OWNS A 100% MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN PRIMELENDING VENTURES MANAGEMENT, LLC (\u201cVENTURES MANAGEMENT\u201d) WHICH HOLDS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN AND IS THE MANAGING MEMBER OF CERTAIN ABAS. AT JUNE 30, 2019, THESE ABAS HAD COMBINED AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT TOTALING $120.0 MILLION, $70.0 MILLION OF WHICH WAS WITH A SINGLE UNAFFILIATED BANK, AND THE REMAINING $50.0 MILLION OF WHICH WAS WITH THE BANK. AT JUNE 30, 2019, VENTURES MANAGEMENT HAD OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OF $64.4 MILLION, $12.7 MILLION OF WHICH WAS WITH THE BANK. IN JULY 2019, VENTURES MANAGEMENT ENTERED INTO AN ADDITIONAL $30.0 MILLION LINE OF CREDIT WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED UNAFFILIATED BANK.  \u200b  INSURANCE SEGMENT  \u200b  OUR INSURANCE OPERATING SUBSIDIARY\u2019S PRIMARY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES ARE TO PRESERVE CAPITAL AND MANAGE FOR A TOTAL RATE OF RETURN. NLC\u2019S STRATEGY IS TO PURCHASE SECURITIES IN SECTORS THAT REPRESENT THE MOST ATTRACTIVE RELATIVE VALUE. BONDS, CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF $130.6 MILLION, OR 83.8%, EQUITY INVESTMENTS OF $19.4 MILLION AND OTHER INVESTMENTS OF $5.9 MILLION COMPRISED NLC\u2019S $155.9 MILLION IN TOTAL CASH AND INVESTMENTS AT JUNE 30, 2019. NLC DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION IN BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT GUARANTOR EXPOSURE OR ANY INVESTMENTS IN SUBPRIME MORTGAGES. NLC HAS CUSTODIAL AGREEMENTS WITH AN UNAFFILIATED BANK AND AN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH DTF HOLDINGS, LLC.  \u200b  IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES  \u200b  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED HEREIN HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, WHICH PRESENTLY REQUIRE US TO MEASURE FINANCIAL POSITION AND OPERATING RESULTS PRIMARILY IN TERMS OF HISTORIC DOLLARS. CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUE OF MONEY DUE TO INFLATION OR RECESSION ARE GENERALLY NOT CONSIDERED. THE PRIMARY EFFECT OF INFLATION ON OUR OPERATIONS IS REFLECTED IN INCREASED OPERATING COSTS. IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S OPINION, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AFFECT THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO A FAR GREATER DEGREE THAN CHANGES IN THE INFLATION RATE. WHILE INTEREST RATES ARE GREATLY INFLUENCED BY CHANGES IN THE INFLATION RATE, THEY DO NOT NECESSARILY CHANGE AT THE SAME RATE OR IN THE SAME MAGNITUDE AS THE INFLATION RATE. INTEREST RATES ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO MANY FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED RATE OF INFLATION, THE INFLUENCE OF GENERAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, ITS AGENCIES AND VARIOUS OTHER GOVERNMENTAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.  \u200b  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS; COMMITMENTS; GUARANTEES  \u200b  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ENTER INTO VARIOUS TRANSACTIONS, WHICH, IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WE ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE TRANSACTIONS INCLUDE COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT, WHICH INVOLVE, TO VARYING DEGREES, ELEMENTS OF CREDIT RISK AND INTEREST RATE RISK IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  \u200b  WE ENTER INTO CONTRACTUAL LOAN COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT, NORMALLY WITH FIXED EXPIRATION DATES OR TERMINATION CLAUSES, AT SPECIFIED RATES AND FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT ARE CONTINGENT UPON CUSTOMERS MAINTAINING SPECIFIC CREDIT STANDARDS UNTIL THE TIME OF LOAN FUNDING. WE MINIMIZE OUR EXPOSURE TO LOSS UNDER THESE COMMITMENTS BY SUBJECTING THEM TO CREDIT APPROVAL AND MONITORING PROCEDURES. WE ASSESS THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT AND HAVE RECORDED A LIABILITY RELATED TO SUCH CREDIT RISK IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u200b  STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE WRITTEN CONDITIONAL COMMITMENTS ISSUED BY US TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF A CUSTOMER TO A THIRD PARTY. IN THE EVENT THE CUSTOMER DOES NOT PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT WITH THE THIRD PARTY, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FUND THE COMMITMENT. THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE IS REPRESENTED BY THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THE COMMITMENT. IF THE COMMITMENT IS FUNDED, WE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO SEEK RECOVERY FROM THE CUSTOMER. OUR POLICIES GENERALLY REQUIRE THAT STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS CONTAIN SECURITY AND DEBT COVENANTS SIMILAR TO THOSE CONTAINED IN LOAN AGREEMENTS.  \u200b  IN THE AGGREGATE, THE BANK HAD OUTSTANDING UNUSED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT OF $2.3 BILLION AT JUNE 30, 2019 AND OUTSTANDING FINANCIAL AND PERFORMANCE STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT OF $92.4 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2019.  \u200b  85  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS EXECUTE, SETTLE AND FINANCE VARIOUS SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY EXPOSE THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS TO OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK IN THE EVENT THAT A CUSTOMER OR COUNTERPARTY DOES NOT FULFILL ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. EXAMPLES OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS INCLUDE THE SALE OF SECURITIES NOT YET PURCHASED BY CUSTOMERS OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS, USE OF DERIVATIVES TO SUPPORT CERTAIN NON-PROFIT HOUSING ORGANIZATION CLIENTS, CLEARING AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS AND VARIOUS CLEARINGHOUSES AND BROKER-DEALERS, SECURED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS THAT INVOLVE PLEDGED SECURITIES, AND WHEN-ISSUED UNDERWRITING AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS.  \u200b  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  \u200b  OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO UNDERSTANDING OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH INVOLVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND COMPLEXITY IN MAKING CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST CRITICAL IN PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATE TO ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LAE, GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MORTGAGE LOAN INDEMNIFICATION LIABILITY, MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS ASSET AND ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  ESTABLISHES A THREE-LEVEL HIERARCHY FOR DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, BASED ON THE TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF AN ASSET OR LIABILITY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE, AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  LEVEL 1 \u2013 INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS.  \u2022  LEVEL 2 \u2013 INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, AND INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.  \u2022  LEVEL 3 \u2013 INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE UNOBSERVABLE AND SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.  14  CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT, HOWEVER, IS REQUIRED IN INTERPRETING MARKET DATA TO DEVELOP THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE.  ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTIMATES PRESENTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE AMOUNTS THE COMPANY WOULD REALIZE IN A CURRENT MARKET EXCHANGE.  THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RESTRICTED CASH, RECEIVABLES, PAYABLES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE BECAUSE OF THE SHORT MATURITY OF THOSE INSTRUMENTS.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY INCLUDE THE COMPANY'S CROSS-CURRENCY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND WERE VALUED AT  $323  MILLION  AND  $237  MILLION  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SENIOR NOTES AND DEBENTURES AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY, WHILE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CREDIT FACILITIES IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN INACTIVE MARKETS AND IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2.  THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE CONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY'S MORTGAGE NOTE LIABILITY APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE.  A SUMMARY OF THE CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE OF DEBT AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  IS AS FOLLOWS.  JUNE 30, 2019  DECEMBER 31, 2018  CARRYING VALUE  FAIR VALUE  CARRYING VALUE  FAIR VALUE  SENIOR NOTES AND DEBENTURES  $62,217  $66,122  $62,868  $61,087  CREDIT FACILITIES  $11,089  $11,123  $9,959  $9,608  NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  THE COMPANY\u2019S NONFINANCIAL ASSETS SUCH AS EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS, FRANCHISES, PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS; HOWEVER, THEY ARE SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS WHEN THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST.

CHARTER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS SHARE OF TAXABLE INCOME OR LOSS OF CHARTER HOLDINGS ALLOCATED TO IT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CHARTER HOLDINGS LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT (\u201cLLC AGREEMENT\u201d) AND PARTNERSHIP TAX RULES AND REGULATIONS. AS A RESULT, CHARTER'S PRIMARY DEFERRED TAX COMPONENT RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS RELATES TO ITS EXCESS FINANCIAL REPORTING OUTSIDE BASIS, EXCLUDING AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONDEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL, OVER CHARTER'S TAX BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IN CHARTER HOLDINGS.

IN DETERMINING THE COMPANY\u2019S TAX PROVISION FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES A RESERVE FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS UNLESS SUCH POSITIONS ARE DETERMINED TO BE \u201cMORE LIKELY THAN NOT\u201d OF BEING SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION, BASED ON THEIR TECHNICAL MERITS.

A/N AND LIBERTY BROADBAND ALSO HAVE CERTAIN OTHER COMMITTEE DESIGNATION AND OTHER GOVERNANCE RIGHTS. MR. THOMAS RUTLEDGE, THE COMPANY\u2019S CEO, IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF CHARTER.  IN DECEMBER 2017, CHARTER AND A/N ENTERED INTO AN AMENDMENT TO THE LETTER AGREEMENT (THE \u201cLETTER AGREEMENT\u201d) THAT REQUIRES A/N TO SELL TO CHARTER OR TO CHARTER HOLDINGS, ON A MONTHLY BASIS, A NUMBER OF SHARES OF CHARTER CLASS A COMMON STOCK OR CHARTER HOLDINGS COMMON UNITS THAT REPRESENTS A PRO RATA PARTICIPATION BY A/N AND ITS AFFILIATES IN ANY REPURCHASES OF SHARES OF CHARTER CLASS A COMMON STOCK FROM PERSONS OTHER THAN A/N EFFECTED BY CHARTER DURING THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING CALENDAR MONTH, AT A PURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE PRICE PAID BY CHARTER FOR THE SHARES REPURCHASED FROM PERSONS OTHER THAN A/N DURING SUCH IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING CALENDAR MONTH.

CONTINGENCIES  IN AUGUST 2015, A PURPORTED STOCKHOLDER OF CHARTER, MATTHEW SCIABACUCCHI, FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY, ON BEHALF OF A PUTATIVE CLASS OF CHARTER STOCKHOLDERS, CHALLENGING THE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING CHARTER, TWC, A/N, AND LIBERTY BROADBAND ANNOUNCED BY CHARTER ON MAY 26, 2015. THE LAWSUIT, WHICH NAMED AS DEFENDANTS CHARTER AND ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, ALLEGED THAT THE TRANSACTIONS RESULTED FROM BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY DUTY BY CHARTER\u2019S DIRECTORS AND THAT LIBERTY BROADBAND IMPROPERLY BENEFITED FROM THE CHALLENGED TRANSACTIONS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER CHARTER STOCKHOLDERS. THE LAWSUIT HAS PROCEEDED TO THE DISCOVERY PHASE.  CHARTER DENIES ANY LIABILITY, BELIEVES THAT IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES, AND INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THIS LAWSUIT. ALTHOUGH CHARTER IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS LAWSUIT, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THE OUTCOME WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR CASH FLOWS.  THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE ALAMEDA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY ARE INVESTIGATING WHETHER CERTAIN OF CHARTER\u2019S WASTE DISPOSAL POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES ARE IN VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE AND THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. THAT INVESTIGATION WAS COMMENCED IN JANUARY 2014. A SIMILAR INVESTIGATION INVOLVING TWC WAS INITIATED  20  CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (UNAUDITED)  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS AND WHERE INDICATED)  IN FEBRUARY 2012.  CHARTER IS COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS.  WHILE THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE OUTCOME WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR CASH FLOWS.  ON DECEMBER 19, 2011, SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY L.P. (\u201cSPRINT\u201d) FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS ALLEGING THAT TWC INFRINGED CERTAIN U.S. PATENTS PURPORTEDLY RELATING TO VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL (\u201cVOIP\u201d) SERVICES. AT THE TRIAL, THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT OF  $140  MILLION  AGAINST TWC AND FURTHER CONCLUDED THAT TWC HAD WILLFULLY INFRINGED SPRINT\u2019S PATENTS.  THE COURT SUBSEQUENTLY DECLINED TO ENHANCE THE DAMAGE AWARD AS A RESULT OF THE PURPORTED WILLFUL INFRINGEMENT AND AWARDED SPRINT AN ADDITIONAL  $6  MILLION  , REPRESENTING PRE-JUDGMENT INTEREST ON THE DAMAGES AWARD.  THE COMPANY APPEALED THE CASE TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT WHERE THE COMPANY LOST THE APPEAL.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO PETITION THE SUPREME COURT AS THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURSUE ITS APPEAL RIGHTS.  IN ADDITION TO ITS APPEAL, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURSUE INDEMNITY FROM ONE OF ITS VENDORS AND HAS BROUGHT A PATENT SUIT AGAINST SPRINT (TC TECH, LLC V. SPRINT) IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE IMPLICATING SPRINT'S LTE TECHNOLOGY.  THE EXPECTED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE SPRINT VERDICT HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE OUTCOME OF THIS LITIGATION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  THE ULTIMATE OUTCOMES OF THE APPEAL OF THE SPRINT KANSAS CASE, THE PURSUIT OF INDEMNITY AGAINST THE COMPANY\u2019S VENDOR AND THE TC TECH LITIGATION CANNOT BE PREDICTED.  SPRINT FILED A SECOND SUIT AGAINST CHARTER ON DECEMBER 2, 2017 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE.  THIS SUIT ALLEGES INFRINGEMENT OF 15 PATENTS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S PROVISION OF VOIP SERVICES (TEN OF WHICH WERE ASSERTED AGAINST LEGACY TWC IN THE MATTER DESCRIBED ABOVE).  CHARTER IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING THIS CASE.  WHILE THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS SPRINT SUIT, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THIS LITIGATION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR CASH FLOWS.  SPRINT FILED A THIRD SUIT AGAINST CHARTER ON MAY 17, 2018 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA.  THIS SUIT ALLEGES INFRINGEMENT OF THREE PATENTS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S VIDEO ON DEMAND SERVICES.  THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING THIS CASE.  THE PARTIES RECENTLY AGREED TO TRANSFER THIS CASE TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE.  WHILE THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS LITIGATION, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THIS LITIGATION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR CASH FLOWS.  THE NEW YORK PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (THE \u201cPSC\u201d), THE REGULATOR FOR THE CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES IN NEW YORK (WHOSE CHAIR DIRECTS AND OPERATES AS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICE (\u201cDPS\u201d)), ISSUED MULTIPLE ORDERS AGAINST CHARTER INCLUDING TWO ORDERS ON JULY 27, 2018 RELATING TO THE AGREEMENT BY WHICH THE PSC APPROVED CHARTER\u2019S MERGER WITH TWC.  ONE ORDER DETERMINED THAT CHARTER HAD FAILED TO SATISFY ONE OF ITS MERGER CONDITIONS BY NOT EXTENDING ITS HIGH SPEED BROADBAND NETWORK ACCORDING TO THE PSC\u2019S INTERPRETATION OF WHICH HOMES AND BUSINESSES CHARTER BUILT TO SHOULD COUNT.  THE ORDER FURTHER DIRECTED THE INITIATION OF A COURT ACTION TO IMPOSE FINANCIAL AND OTHER PENALTIES ON CHARTER WHICH THE PSC INITIATED.  THE SECOND ORDER PURPORTED TO RESCIND THE PSC\u2019S JANUARY 2016 APPROVAL OF CHARTER\u2019S MERGER WITH TWC\u2019S NEW YORK OPERATIONS AND DIRECTED CHARTER TO SUBMIT A PLAN TO EFFECT AN ORDERLY TRANSITION TO A SUCCESSOR PROVIDER OR PROVIDERS AND FOR CHARTER TO CEASE OPERATIONS IN NEW YORK WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THE ORDER WHICH DEADLINE WAS EXTENDED AS THE DPS AND CHARTER NEGOTIATED A RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS.  ON APRIL 19, 2019, DPS AND CHARTER JOINTLY PRESENTED TO THE PSC A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT TO RESOLVE THESE DISPUTES, AND ON JULY 11, 2019, THE PSC APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT.  THE SETTLEMENT RESOLVED ALL OUTSTANDING MATTERS REGARDING THESE DISPUTES.  NO PENALTIES OR FORFEITURE WERE ASSESSED AS A RESULT OF THE AGREEMENT, AND THE COMPANY WAS NOT FOUND TO HAVE COMMITTED, NOR DID IT ADMIT TO, ANY VIOLATION. THE INCREMENTAL OPERATING AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY TO MEET THE BUILDOUT AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY.  IN ADDITION TO THE SPRINT LITIGATION DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT OR CO-DEFENDANT IN SEVERAL ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS INVOLVING ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OF VARIOUS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESSES. OTHER INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS ARE ALSO DEFENDANTS IN CERTAIN OF THESE CASES. IN THE EVENT THAT A COURT ULTIMATELY DETERMINES THAT THE COMPANY INFRINGES ON ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES AND/OR AN INJUNCTION THAT COULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY OR ITS VENDORS TO MODIFY CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THE COMPANY OFFERS TO ITS SUBSCRIBERS, AS WELL AS NEGOTIATE ROYALTY OR LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AT ISSUE. WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE LAWSUITS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THE ACTIONS VIGOROUSLY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT ANY ADVERSE OUTCOME WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR LIQUIDITY. THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH CLAIMS NOR CAN IT REASONABLY ESTIMATE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS.  21  CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (UNAUDITED)  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS AND WHERE INDICATED)  THE COMPANY IS PARTY TO OTHER LAWSUITS, CLAIMS AND REGULATORY INQUIRIES THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF CONDUCTING ITS BUSINESS. THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE OTHER LEGAL MATTERS PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY CANNOT BE PREDICTED, AND ALTHOUGH SUCH LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS ARE NOT EXPECTED INDIVIDUALLY TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY, SUCH LAWSUITS COULD HAVE, IN THE AGGREGATE, A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY. WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPANY ULTIMATELY PREVAILS IN ANY PARTICULAR LAWSUIT OR CLAIM, LITIGATION CAN BE TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY AND INJURE THE COMPANY\u2019S REPUTATION.  20.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS  THE COMPANY SPONSORS TWO QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, THE TWC PENSION PLAN AND THE TWC UNION PENSION PLAN, THAT PROVIDE PENSION BENEFITS TO A MAJORITY OF EMPLOYEES WHO WERE EMPLOYED BY TWC BEFORE THE ACQUISITION OF TWC. THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES A NONQUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES UNDER THE TWC EXCESS PENSION PLAN.  PENSION BENEFITS ARE BASED ON FORMULAS THAT REFLECT THE EMPLOYEES\u2019 YEARS OF SERVICE AND COMPENSATION DURING THEIR EMPLOYMENT PERIOD.  ACTUARIAL GAINS OR LOSSES ARE CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF EITHER THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS RESULTING FROM EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT FROM THAT ASSUMED OR FROM CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS.  THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO FOLLOW A MARK-TO-MARKET PENSION ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR RECORDING THE ACTUARIAL GAINS OR LOSSES ANNUALLY DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, OR EARLIER IF A REMEASUREMENT EVENT OCCURS DURING AN INTERIM PERIOD.  NO FUTURE COMPENSATION INCREASES OR FUTURE SERVICE WILL BE CREDITED TO PARTICIPANTS OF THE PENSION PLANS GIVEN THE FROZEN NATURE OF THE PLANS.  THE COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC PENSION BENEFIT (COSTS) FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  ARE RECORDED IN OTHER PENSION BENEFITS, NET IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING.  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019  2018  2019  2018  INTEREST COST  $(  32  )  $(  32  )  $(  64  )  $(  64  )  EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS  41  52  82  104  NET PERIODIC PENSION BENEFITS  $9  $20  $18  $40  THE COMPANY MADE NO CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  ; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY MAKE DISCRETIONARY CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS IN THE FUTURE. SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE DEPENDENT ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CURRENT AND EXPECTED INTEREST RATES, ASSET PERFORMANCE, THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS AND MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT. FOR THE NONQUALIFIED UNFUNDED PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS DURING  2019  TO THE EXTENT BENEFITS ARE PAID.  21.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED JANUARY 1, 2018  ASU NO. 2014-09, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d)  UPON ADOPTION OF ASU 2014-09, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT WHICH INCLUDED AN INCREASE TO TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY OF  $38  MILLION  AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018.  ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED JANUARY 1, 2019  ASU NO. 2016-02, LEASES (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d)  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-02 WHICH REQUIRES LESSEES TO RECOGNIZE ALMOST ALL LEASES ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET AS A LEASE ASSET AND A LEASE LIABILITY.  FOR INCOME STATEMENT PURPOSES, THE FASB RETAINED A DUAL MODEL, REQUIRING LEASES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER OPERATING OR FINANCE. CLASSIFICATION IS BASED ON CRITERIA LARGELY SIMILAR TO THE CRITERIA APPLIED UNDER LEGACY LEASE ACCOUNTING, BUT WITHOUT EXPLICIT BRIGHT LINES.  22  CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (UNAUDITED)  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS AND WHERE INDICATED)  THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2016-02 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH WITH A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT RECORDED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION (JANUARY 1, 2019). THEREFORE, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED OPERATING LEASES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WITHOUT REVISING COMPARATIVE PERIOD INFORMATION OR DISCLOSURE.  AT TRANSITION, THE COMPANY ELECTED THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS PERMITTED UNDER THE TRANSITION GUIDANCE WITHIN THE STANDARD, WHICH ELIMINATES THE REASSESSMENT OF PAST LEASES, CLASSIFICATION AND INITIAL DIRECT COSTS. THE COMPANY DID NOT ELECT TO USE HINDSIGHT TO REASSESS LEASE TERMS OR IMPAIRMENT AT THE ADOPTION DATE.  THE COMPANY ELECTED THE LAND EASEMENTS PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY NOT TO RETROSPECTIVELY TREAT LAND EASEMENTS AS LEASES; HOWEVER, MUST APPLY LEASE ACCOUNTING PROSPECTIVELY TO LAND EASEMENTS IF THEY MEET THE DEFINITION OF A LEASE.  THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED INTERNAL CONTROLS AND KEY SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY TO ENABLE THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON ADOPTION.  THE NEW STANDARD RESULTED IN THE RECORDING OF LEASED ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING LEASES OF APPROXIMATELY  $1.1  BILLION  AND  $1.2  BILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LEASED ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES PRIMARILY REPRESENTS THE PRIOR YEAR END DEFERRED RENT LIABILITIES BALANCE, RESULTING FROM HISTORICAL STRAIGHT-LINING OF OPERATING LEASES, WHICH WAS EFFECTIVELY RECLASSIFIED UPON ADOPTION TO REDUCE THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LEASED ASSETS.  THE ADOPTION OF THE STANDARD DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND IS NOT ANTICIPATED TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL INTERIM AND ANNUAL LEASE DISCLOSURES.  SEE NOTE 5 FOR INTERIM LEASE DISCLOSURES FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019.  ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED  ASU NO. 2016-13, MEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d)  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-13, WHICH REQUIRES A FINANCIAL ASSET (OR A GROUP OF FINANCIAL ASSETS) MEASURED AT AMORTIZED COST BASIS TO BE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT UNDER THE CURRENT EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS MODEL RATHER THAN AN INCURRED LOSS MODEL. THE MEASUREMENT OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES IS BASED ON RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT PAST EVENTS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT CONDITIONS AND REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE FORECASTS THAT AFFECT THE COLLECTABILITY OF THE REPORTED AMOUNT.  ASU 2016-13 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019 (JANUARY 1, 2020 FOR THE COMPANY). EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED.  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE IMPACT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-13 WILL HAVE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ASU NO. 2017-04, SIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT (\u201cASU 2017-04\u201d)  IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-04 WHICH ELIMINATES STEP TWO FROM THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. UNDER THE NEW STANDARD, TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY WILL RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECOGNIZED SHOULD NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THE REPORTING UNIT. ASU 2017-04 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019 (JANUARY 1, 2020 FOR THE COMPANY). EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-04 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ASU NO. 2018-15, CUSTOMER\u2019S ACCOUNTING FOR IMPLEMENTATION COSTS IN A CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT (\"ASU 2018-15\")  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-15 WHICH REQUIRES UPFRONT IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED IN A CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENT (OR HOSTING ARRANGEMENT) THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT TO BE AMORTIZED TO HOSTING EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENT.  ASU 2018-15 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019 (JANUARY 1, 2020 FOR THE COMPANY).  EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED.

ASU NO. 2019-02, IMPROVEMENTS TO ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS OF FILMS AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS FOR PROGRAM MATERIALS (\"ASU 2019-02\")  IN MARCH 2019, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2019-02 WHICH ALIGNS THE ACCOUNTING FOR PRODUCTION COSTS OF AN EPISODIC TELEVISION SERIES WITH THE ACCOUNTING FOR PRODUCTION COSTS OF FILMS REGARDING COST CAPITALIZATION, AMORTIZATION, IMPAIRMENT, PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE.  ASU 2019-02 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019 (JANUARY 1, 2020  23  CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  GENERAL  CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARIES, \u201cCHARTER\u201d) IS THE SECOND LARGEST CABLE OPERATOR IN THE UNITED STATES AND A LEADING BROADBAND COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES COMPANY PROVIDING VIDEO, INTERNET AND VOICE SERVICES TO APPROXIMATELY  28.7 MILLION  RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESS CUSTOMERS AT  JUNE 30, 2019  .  WE ALSO RECENTLY LAUNCHED OUR MOBILE SERVICE TO RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS.  IN ADDITION, WE SELL VIDEO AND ONLINE ADVERTISING INVENTORY TO LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISING CUSTOMERS AND FIBER-DELIVERED COMMUNICATIONS AND MANAGED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS TO LARGER ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS.  WE ALSO OWN AND OPERATE REGIONAL SPORTS NETWORKS AND LOCAL SPORTS, NEWS AND COMMUNITY CHANNELS.  CHARTER IS A HOLDING COMPANY WHOSE PRINCIPAL ASSET IS A CONTROLLING EQUITY INTEREST IN CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS, LLC (\u201cCHARTER HOLDINGS\u201d), AN INDIRECT OWNER OF CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS OPERATING, LLC (\u201cCHARTER OPERATING\u201d) UNDER WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE OPERATIONS RESIDE. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS AMONG CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.  OVERVIEW  SINCE THE CLOSE OF THE ACQUISITIONS IN 2016 OF TIME WARNER CABLE INC. (\"TWC\") AND BRIGHT HOUSE NETWORKS, LLC (\"BRIGHT HOUSE\"), WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON INTEGRATING THE PRACTICES AND SYSTEMS OF CHARTER, TWC AND BRIGHT HOUSE, CENTRALIZING OUR PRODUCT, MARKETING, SALES AND SERVICE OPERATIONS, INSOURCING THE TWC AND BRIGHT HOUSE WORKFORCES IN OUR CALL CENTERS AND FIELD OPERATIONS, AND ROLLING OUT SPECTRUM PRICING AND PACKAGING (\"SPP\") TO TWC AND BRIGHT HOUSE SERVICE AREAS.  IN 2018, WE COMPLETED THE CONVERSION OF THE REMAINING TWC AND BRIGHT HOUSE ANALOG SERVICE AREAS TO AN ALL-DIGITAL PLATFORM ENABLING US TO DELIVER MORE HD CHANNELS AND HIGHER INTERNET SPEEDS. NEARLY ALL OF OUR FOOTPRINT IS NOW ALL-DIGITAL.  ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE DOUBLED MINIMUM INTERNET SPEEDS TO 200 MBPS IN A NUMBER OF SERVICE AREAS AT NO ADDITIONAL COST TO NEW AND EXISTING SPP INTERNET CUSTOMERS.  IN 2018, LEVERAGING DOCSIS 3.1 TECHNOLOGY, WE ALSO EXPANDED THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR SPECTRUM INTERNET GIG SERVICE TO NEARLY ALL OF OUR FOOTPRINT.  WITH OUR INTEGRATION NEARLY COMPLETE, WE ARE FOCUSED ON OPERATING AS ONE COMPANY, WITH A UNIFIED PRODUCT, MARKETING AND SERVICE INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO ACCELERATE GROWTH AND INNOVATE FASTER.  WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LESS CUSTOMER-FACING CHANGE EXPECTED IN 2019, WE ARE FOCUSED ON DEPLOYING SUPERIOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICE WITH MINIMAL SERVICE DISRUPTIONS.  WE EXPECT OUR GROWING LEVELS OF PRODUCTIVITY WILL RESULT IN LOWER CUSTOMER CHURN, LONGER CUSTOMER LIFETIMES AND IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY WITH FEWER CUSTOMER CALLS AND TRUCK ROLLS PER CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP.  WITH OVER 80% OF OUR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER BASE NOW IN SPP PACKAGES, WE EXPECT ADDITIONAL BENEFITS FROM LOWER LEGACY PACKAGE MIGRATION ACTIVITY, COMBINED WITH SPP CUSTOMERS ROLLING OFF INTRODUCTORY PRICING AND MODEST PRICE INCREASES.  FURTHER, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP GROWTH THROUGH SALES OF VIDEO, INTERNET, WIRELINE VOICE AND MOBILE PACKAGED SERVICES.  ADDITIONALLY, WITH THE COMPLETION OF OUR ALL-DIGITAL CONVERSION, ROLL-OUT OF DOCSIS 3.1 TECHNOLOGY ACROSS OUR FOOTPRINT, AND THE INTEGRATION OF TWC AND BRIGHT HOUSE MOSTLY COMPLETE, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A MEANINGFUL REDUCTION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENT OF REVENUE IN 2019 AND EXPECT THESE REDUCTIONS TO CONTINUE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, WE LAUNCHED OUR MOBILE PRODUCT, SPECTRUM MOBILE, UNDER OUR MOBILE VIRTUAL NETWORK OPERATOR (\"MVNO\") RESELLER AGREEMENT WITH VERIZON.  OUR SPECTRUM MOBILE SERVICE IS OFFERED TO OUR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS SUBSCRIBING TO OUR INTERNET SERVICE AND RUNS ON VERIZON'S MOBILE NETWORK COMBINED WITH SPECTRUM WIFI.  WE BEGAN MASS MARKET ADVERTISING OF SPECTRUM MOBILE IN SEPTEMBER 2018.  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE EXPANDED OUR SPECTRUM MOBILE BRING-YOUR-OWN-DEVICE (\"BYOD\") PROGRAM ACROSS ALL SALES CHANNELS TO INCLUDE A BROADER SET OF DEVICES.  WE BELIEVE OUR BYOD PROGRAM WILL LOWER THE COST FOR CONSUMERS OF SWITCHING MOBILE CARRIERS, AND WILL REDUCE THE SHORT-TERM WORKING CAPITAL IMPACT OF SELLING NEW MOBILE DEVICES ON INSTALLMENT PLANS.  WE EXPECT THESE DEVELOPMENTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWTH OF OUR MOBILE BUSINESS.  WE ALSO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE WAYS TO MANAGE OUR OWN NETWORK AND DRIVE EVEN MORE MOBILE TRAFFIC TO OUR NETWORK THROUGH OUR CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF IN-HOME AND OUTDOOR WIFI HOTSPOTS.  IN ADDITION, WE PLAN TO USE OUR WIFI NETWORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH ADDITIONAL UNLICENSED OR LICENSED SPECTRUM TO IMPROVE NETWORK PERFORMANCE AND EXPAND CAPACITY TO OFFER CONSUMERS A SUPERIOR MOBILE SERVICE AT A LOWER TOTAL COST TO US.\u200b\u200b  FURTHER, WE HAVE EXPERIMENTAL WIRELESS LICENSES FROM THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION THAT WE ARE UTILIZING TO TEST NEXT GENERATION MOBILE SERVICES IN SEVERAL SERVICE AREAS AROUND THE COUNTRY.  IN 2018, WE INVESTED IN OUR MOBILE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP WITH COMCAST CORPORATION, WITH A PORTION REPRESENTING OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE PARTNERSHIP AND A PORTION REPRESENTING A PREPAYMENT OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED SERVICES FOR THE MOBILE BACK OFFICE PLATFORM.  AS THE PARTNERSHIP DELIVERS SERVICES, WE WILL REFLECT SUCH SERVICES AS CAPITAL OR OPERATING EXPENSE DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF SERVICES DELIVERED.  WE BELIEVE SPECTRUM-BRANDED MOBILE SERVICES WILL DRIVE HIGHER SALES OF OUR CORE PRODUCTS, CREATE LONGER CUSTOMER LIVES AND INCREASE PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOW OVER TIME.  AS A RESULT OF GROWTH COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR NEW MOBILE PRODUCT LINE, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GROW REVENUES OR MAINTAIN OUR MARGINS AT RECENT HISTORICAL RATES.  DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS  31  ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , OUR MOBILE PRODUCT LINE INCREASED REVENUES BY  $158 MILLION  AND  $298 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, REDUCED ADJUSTED EBITDA BY APPROXIMATELY  $119 MILLION  AND  $239 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AND REDUCED FREE CASH FLOW BY APPROXIMATELY  $297 MILLION  AND  $588 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.

USE OF ADJUSTED EBITDA  AND FREE CASH FLOW  WE USE CERTAIN MEASURES THAT ARE NOT DEFINED BY GAAP TO EVALUATE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. ADJUSTED EBITDA AND FREE CASH FLOW ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHARTER SHAREHOLDERS AND NET CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THESE TERMS, AS DEFINED BY US, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. ADJUSTED EBITDA AND FREE CASH FLOW ARE RECONCILED TO NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHARTER SHAREHOLDERS AND NET CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, RESPECTIVELY, BELOW.  ADJUSTED EBITDA ELIMINATES THE SIGNIFICANT NON-CASH DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE THAT RESULTS FROM THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES AS WELL AS OTHER NON-CASH OR SPECIAL ITEMS, AND IS UNAFFECTED BY OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE OR INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, THIS MEASURE IS LIMITED IN THAT IT DOES NOT REFLECT THE PERIODIC COSTS OF CERTAIN CAPITALIZED TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS USED IN GENERATING REVENUES AND OUR CASH COST OF FINANCING. THESE COSTS ARE EVALUATED THROUGH OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES.  FREE CASH FLOW IS DEFINED AS NET CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, LESS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND CHANGES IN ACCRUED EXPENSES RELATED TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  MANAGEMENT AND CHARTER\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS USE ADJUSTED EBITDA AND FREE CASH FLOW TO ASSESS OUR PERFORMANCE AND OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE OUR DEBT, FUND OPERATIONS AND MAKE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS WITH INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS. IN ADDITION, ADJUSTED EBITDA GENERALLY CORRELATES TO THE LEVERAGE RATIO CALCULATION UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES OR OUTSTANDING NOTES TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THE FACILITIES AND NOTES (ALL SUCH DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \u201cSEC\u201d)). FOR THE PURPOSE OF CALCULATING COMPLIANCE WITH LEVERAGE COVENANTS, WE USE ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, EXCLUDING CERTAIN EXPENSES PAID BY OUR OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES TO OTHER CHARTER ENTITIES. OUR DEBT COVENANTS REFER TO THESE EXPENSES AS MANAGEMENT FEES, WHICH WERE  $299 MILLION  AND  $599 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  $265 MILLION  AND  $538 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

RECENT EVENTS  IN MAY 2019, CCO HOLDINGS, LLC AND CCO HOLDINGS CAPITAL CORP. JOINTLY ISSUED  $750 MILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  5.375%  SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE 2029 AT PAR AND IN JULY 2019, AN ADDITIONAL  $750 MILLION  OF THE SAME SERIES OF NOTES WERE ISSUED AT A PRICE OF  102.000%  OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. THE NET PROCEEDS WERE USED TO PAY RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING FUNDING BUYBACKS OF CHARTER CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND CHARTER HOLDINGS COMMON UNITS AS WELL AS REPAYING CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS.  IN JULY 2019, CHARTER OPERATING AND CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS OPERATING CAPITAL CORP. JOINTLY ISSUED  $1.25 BILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  5.125%  SENIOR NOTES DUE 2049 AT A PRICE OF  99.880%  OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT.  THE NET PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO PAY RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING FUNDING POTENTIAL BUYBACKS OF CHARTER CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND CHARTER HOLDINGS COMMON UNITS AS WELL AS REPAYING CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE TIME WARNER CABLE, LLC'S  5.000%  SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020.  OVERVIEW OF OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND LIQUIDITY  WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF DEBT. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR DEBT AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  WAS  $72.6 BILLION  , CONSISTING OF  $11.2 BILLION  OF CREDIT FACILITY DEBT,  $41.8 BILLION  OF INVESTMENT GRADE SENIOR SECURED NOTES AND  $19.7 BILLION  OF HIGH-YIELD SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES. OUR BUSINESS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT CASH TO FUND PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON OUR DEBT.  OUR PROJECTED CASH NEEDS AND PROJECTED SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY DEPEND UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS, AND THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF OUR EXPENDITURES. AS WE LAUNCH OUR NEW MOBILE SERVICES, WE EXPECT AN INITIAL FUNDING PERIOD TO GROW A NEW PRODUCT AS WELL AS NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL IMPACTS FROM THE TIMING OF DEVICE-RELATED CASH FLOWS WHEN WE PROVIDE THE HANDSET OR TABLET TO CUSTOMERS PURSUANT TO EQUIPMENT INSTALLMENT PLANS.  FREE CASH FLOW WAS  $1.1 BILLION  AND  $1.8 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  $804 MILLION  AND  $755 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE INCREASE IN FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR PERIODS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND HIGHER ADJUSTED EBITDA OFFSET BY AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN CASH PAID FOR INTEREST.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY  $4.1 BILLION  AND CASH ON HAND WAS APPROXIMATELY  $696 MILLION  .  WE EXPECT TO UTILIZE FREE CASH FLOW, CASH ON HAND AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AS WELL AS FUTURE REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS TO FURTHER EXTEND THE MATURITIES OF OUR OBLIGATIONS. THE TIMING AND TERMS OF ANY REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AMONG OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, AND DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, USE CASH ON HAND AND THE PROCEEDS FROM SECURITIES OFFERINGS OR OTHER BORROWINGS TO RETIRE OUR DEBT THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED PURCHASES, TENDER OFFERS OR REDEMPTION PROVISIONS. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY FROM CASH ON HAND, FREE CASH FLOW AND CHARTER OPERATING\u2019S REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AS WELL AS ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS TO FUND OUR PROJECTED CASH NEEDS.  WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF OUR CASH ON HAND AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE FREE CASH FLOW INCLUDING TO INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS GROWTH AND OTHER STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AS WELL AS STOCK REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS. CHARTER'S TARGET LEVERAGE REMAINS AT 4 TO 4.5 TIMES, AND UP TO 3.5 TIMES AT THE CHARTER OPERATING LEVEL. OUR LEVERAGE WAS 4.4 AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  .  WE EXPECT TO INCREASE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS TO MAINTAIN LEVERAGE WITHIN CHARTER'S TARGET LEVERAGE RANGE.  DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , CHARTER PURCHASED APPROXIMATELY  2.2 MILLION  AND  4.9 MILLION  SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, OF CHARTER CLASS A COMMON STOCK FOR APPROXIMATELY  $837 MILLION  AND  $1.7 BILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AND DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , CHARTER PURCHASED  5.7 MILLION  AND  7.3 MILLION  SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, OF CHARTER CLASS A COMMON STOCK FOR APPROXIMATELY  $1.7 BILLION  AND  $2.2 BILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  IN DECEMBER 2017, CHARTER AND A/N ENTERED INTO AN AMENDMENT TO THE LETTER AGREEMENT (THE \"LETTER AGREEMENT\") THAT REQUIRES A/N TO SELL TO CHARTER OR TO CHARTER HOLDINGS, ON A MONTHLY BASIS, A NUMBER OF SHARES OF CHARTER CLASS A COMMON STOCK OR CHARTER HOLDINGS COMMON UNITS THAT REPRESENTS A PRO RATA PARTICIPATION BY A/N AND ITS AFFILIATES IN ANY REPURCHASES OF SHARES OF CHARTER CLASS A COMMON STOCK FROM PERSONS OTHER THAN A/N EFFECTED BY CHARTER DURING THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING CALENDAR MONTH, AT A PURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE PRICE PAID BY CHARTER FOR THE SHARES REPURCHASED FROM PERSONS OTHER THAN A/N DURING SUCH  40  IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING CALENDAR MONTH. A/N AND CHARTER BOTH HAVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE OR SUSPEND THE PRO RATA REPURCHASE ARRANGEMENT ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. CHARTER HOLDINGS PURCHASED FROM A/N  0.4 MILLION  AND  0.8 MILLION  CHARTER HOLDINGS COMMON UNITS AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER UNIT OF  $358.21  AND  $338.12  , OR  $161 MILLION  AND  $254 MILLION  , DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  0.7 MILLION  AND  1.1 MILLION  CHARTER HOLDINGS COMMON UNITS AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER UNIT OF  $295.31  AND  $312.38  , OR  $201 MILLION  AND  $328 MILLION  , DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , CHARTER HAD REMAINING BOARD AUTHORITY TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL  $769 MILLION  OF CHARTER\u2019S CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND/OR CHARTER HOLDINGS COMMON UNITS.  CHARTER IS NOT OBLIGATED TO ACQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR AMOUNT OF COMMON STOCK, AND THE TIMING OF ANY PURCHASES THAT MAY OCCUR CANNOT BE PREDICTED AND WILL LARGELY DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER POTENTIAL USES OF CAPITAL. PURCHASES MAY INCLUDE OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, TENDER OFFERS OR NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS.  AS POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS, SWAPS OR DISPOSITIONS ARISE, WE ACTIVELY REVIEW THEM AGAINST OUR OBJECTIVES INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, IMPROVING THE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, GEOGRAPHIC CLUSTERING OF ASSETS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT OR TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES OF OUR BUSINESS AND ACHIEVING APPROPRIATE RETURN TARGETS, AND WE MAY PARTICIPATE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE THESE POSSIBILITIES PRESENT ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ACTUALLY COMPLETE ANY ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS OR SYSTEM SWAPS, OR THAT ANY SUCH TRANSACTIONS WILL BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS OR RESULTS.  FREE CASH FLOW  FREE CASH FLOW INCREASED  $308 MILLION  AND  $1.0 BILLION  DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR PERIODS IN  2018  DUE TO THE FOLLOWING (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS).

LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTIONS  DISTRIBUTIONS BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO A PARENT COMPANY FOR PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL ON PARENT COMPANY NOTES ARE RESTRICTED UNDER INDENTURES AND CREDIT FACILITIES GOVERNING OUR INDEBTEDNESS, UNLESS THERE IS NO DEFAULT UNDER THE APPLICABLE INDENTURE AND CREDIT FACILITIES, AND UNLESS EACH APPLICABLE SUBSIDIARY\u2019S LEVERAGE RATIO TEST IS MET AT THE TIME OF SUCH DISTRIBUTION.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THERE WAS NO DEFAULT UNDER ANY OF THESE INDENTURES OR CREDIT FACILITIES, AND EACH SUBSIDIARY MET ITS APPLICABLE LEVERAGE RATIO TESTS BASED ON  JUNE 30, 2019  FINANCIAL RESULTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL SATISFY THESE TESTS AT THE TIME OF THE CONTEMPLATED DISTRIBUTION. DISTRIBUTIONS BY CHARTER OPERATING FOR PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL ON PARENT COMPANY NOTES ARE FURTHER RESTRICTED BY THE COVENANTS IN ITS CREDIT FACILITIES.  HOWEVER, WITHOUT REGARD TO LEVERAGE, DURING ANY CALENDAR YEAR OR ANY PORTION THEREOF DURING WHICH THE BORROWER IS A FLOW-THROUGH ENTITY FOR TAX PURPOSES, AND SO LONG AS NO EVENT OF DEFAULT EXISTS, THE BORROWER MAY MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE EQUITY INTERESTS OF THE BORROWER IN AN AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO MAKE PERMITTED TAX PAYMENTS.  IN ADDITION TO THE LIMITATION ON DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER THE VARIOUS INDENTURES, DISTRIBUTIONS BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY BE LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, INCLUDING THE DELAWARE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY ACT, UNDER WHICH OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY ONLY MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS IF THEY HAVE \u201cSURPLUS\u201d AS DEFINED IN THE ACT.  41  HISTORICAL OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH.

NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED  $348 MILLION  DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, EXCLUDING THE CHANGE IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCRUED EXPENSES RELATED TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, THAT USED $578 MILLION MORE CASH AS A RESULT OF A ONE-TIME IMPACT FROM A STANDARDIZATION OF BILL CYCLES AND LOWER PAYABLES OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EBITDA OF  $296 MILLION.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $3.7 BILLION  AND  $5.1 BILLION  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

THE INCREASE IN CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT BY WHICH BORROWINGS OF LONG-TERM DEBT EXCEEDED REPAYMENTS OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE PURCHASE OF TREASURY STOCK AND NONCONTROLLING INTEREST.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT ONGOING CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE  $1.6 BILLION  AND  $3.3 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  $2.4 BILLION  AND  $4.6 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CUSTOMER PREMISE EQUIPMENT EXPENDITURES AS A RESULT OF THE COMPLETION OF OUR ALL-DIGITAL CONVERSION AND FEWER SPP MIGRATIONS, LOWER SCALABLE INFRASTRUCTURE AS A RESULT OF THE COMPLETION OF THE ROLL-OUT OF DOCSIS 3.1 TECHNOLOGY ACROSS OUR FOOTPRINT IN 2018 AND LOWER SUPPORT SPENDING WITH THE SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION OF THE INTEGRATION OF TWC AND BRIGHT HOUSE.  SEE THE TABLE BELOW FOR MORE DETAILS.  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EXCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO MOBILE, TO BE APPROXIMATELY $7 BILLION IN 2019, VERSUS $8.9 BILLION IN 2018.  THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2019 WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING FURTHER SPEND RELATED TO PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH RATES OF BOTH OUR RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES.  OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE FUNDED PRIMARILY FROM CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND BORROWINGS ON OUR CREDIT FACILITY.

OVERVIEW  THE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (  \"  MD&A  \"  ) IS INTENDED TO HELP THE READER MORE FULLY UNDERSTAND THE OPERATIONS AND PRESENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OF USA TRUCK INC.  MD&A IS PROVIDED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO, AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH, THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT APPEARS ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.  THIS OVERVIEW SUMMARIZES THE MD&A, WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS.  OUR BUSINESS  \u2013 A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS, THE ORGANIZATION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND THE SERVICE OFFERINGS THAT COMPRISE OUR OPERATIONS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \u2013 AN ANALYSIS OF THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS FILING AND A DISCUSSION OF SEASONALITY, THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF INFLATION AND FUEL AVAILABILITY AND COST.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  \u2013 AN ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOWS, SOURCES AND USES OF CASH, DEBT, EQUITY AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.  OUR BUSINESS  USA TRUCK OFFERS A BROAD RANGE OF TRUCKLOAD MOTOR CARRIER AND FREIGHT BROKERAGE AND LOGISTICS SERVICES TO A DIVERSIFIED CUSTOMER BASE THAT SPANS A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES.  THE COMPANY HAS TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: (I) TRUCKING, CONSISTING OF ONE-WAY TRUCKLOAD MOTOR CARRIER SERVICES, IN WHICH VOLUMES TYPICALLY ARE NOT CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED, AND DEDICATED CONTRACT MOTOR CARRIER SERVICES, IN WHICH A COMBINATION OF EQUIPMENT AND DRIVERS IS CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED TO A PARTICULAR CUSTOMER, TYPICALLY FOR A DURATION OF AT LEAST ONE YEAR, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CANCELLATION RIGHTS, AND (II) USAT LOGISTICS, CONSISTING OF FREIGHT BROKERAGE, LOGISTICS, AND RAIL INTERMODAL SERVICE OFFERINGS.  THE TRUCKING SEGMENT PROVIDES ONE-WAY TRUCKLOAD TRANSPORTATION, INCLUDING DEDICATED SERVICES, OF VARIOUS PRODUCTS, GOODS AND MATERIALS.  THE TRUCKING SEGMENT PRIMARILY USES ITS OWN PURCHASED OR LEASED TRACTORS AND TRAILERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS AND IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS \"ASSET-BASED\" TRUCKING.  THE COMPANY'S USAT LOGISTICS SERVICES MATCH CUSTOMER SHIPMENTS WITH AVAILABLE EQUIPMENT OF AUTHORIZED THIRD-PARTY MOTOR CARRIERS AND OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS AND PROVIDE SERVICES THAT COMPLEMENT THE COMPANY'S TRUCKING OPERATIONS.  USAT LOGISTICS PROVIDES THESE SERVICES PRIMARILY TO EXISTING TRUCKING CUSTOMERS, MANY OF WHOM PREFER TO RELY ON A SINGLE SERVICE PROVIDER, OR A SMALL GROUP OF SERVICE PROVIDERS, TO PROVIDE ALL THEIR TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS.  REVENUE FOR THE COMPANY'S TRUCKING SEGMENT IS SUBSTANTIALLY GENERATED BY TRANSPORTING FREIGHT FOR CUSTOMERS, AND IS PREDOMINANTLY AFFECTED BY THE RATES PER MILE RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS, THE NUMBER OF TRACTORS IN OPERATION, AND THE NUMBER OF REVENUE-GENERATING MILES PER TRACTOR.  THE COMPANY SUPPLEMENTS ITS TRUCKING OPERATING REVENUE BY CHARGING FOR FUEL SURCHARGE AND ANCILLARY SERVICES SUCH AS STOP-OFF CHARGES, LOADING AND UNLOADING ACTIVITIES, TRACTOR AND TRAILER DETENTION, EXPEDITED CHARGES, REPOSITIONING CHARGES AND OTHER SIMILAR SERVICES.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OPERATING EXPENSES THAT HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF THE TRUCKING SEGMENT FALL INTO TWO CATEGORIES: VARIABLE AND FIXED.  VARIABLE COSTS, OR MOSTLY VARIABLE COSTS, CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSPORTING FREIGHT FOR CUSTOMERS, AND INCLUDE DRIVER WAGES AND BENEFITS, FUEL AND FUEL TAXES, PAYMENTS TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS FOR PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION, OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE AND INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE.  THESE COSTS VARY PRIMARILY ACCORDING TO MILES OPERATED, BUT ALSO HAVE CONTROLLABLE COMPONENTS BASED ON PERCENTAGE OF COMPENSATED MILES, SHOP AND DISPATCH EFFICIENCY, AND SAFETY AND CLAIMS EXPERIENCE.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FIXED COSTS, OR MOSTLY FIXED COSTS, INCLUDE THE CAPITAL COSTS OF OUR ASSETS (DEPRECIATION, RENT AND INTEREST), COMPENSATION OF NON-DRIVING EMPLOYEES AND PORTIONS OF INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSES.  THESE EXPENSES ARE PARTIALLY CONTROLLABLE THROUGH MANAGEMENT OF FLEET SIZE AND FACILITIES INFRASTRUCTURE, HEADCOUNT EFFICIENCY, AND OPERATING SAFELY.  FUEL AND FUEL TAX EXPENSE CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY WITH CHANGES IN DIESEL FUEL PRICES AND IS ONE OF OUR MOST VOLATILE VARIABLE EXPENSES.  TO MITIGATE THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO FUEL PRICE INCREASES, IT RECOVERS FROM ITS CUSTOMERS FUEL SURCHARGES THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE RECOUPED A MAJORITY OF THE INCREASED FUEL COSTS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CANNOT ASSURE THE RECOVERY LEVELS EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST WILL CONTINUE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY'S FUEL SURCHARGE PROGRAM MITIGATES SOME EXPOSURE TO RISING FUEL COSTS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO HAVE EXPOSURE TO INCREASING FUEL COSTS RELATED TO EMPTY MILES, OUT-OF-ROUTE MILES, FUEL INEFFICIENCY DUE TO ENGINE IDLE TIME AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE SURCHARGE PAID BY THE CUSTOMER IS INSUFFICIENT TO COMPENSATE FOR HIGHER FUEL COSTS, PARTICULARLY IN TIMES OF RAPIDLY INCREASING FUEL PRICES.  THE MAIN FACTORS THAT AFFECT FUEL SURCHARGE REVENUE ARE THE PRICE OF DIESEL FUEL AND THE NUMBER OF LOADED MILES.  THE FUEL SURCHARGE IS BILLED ON A LAGGING BASIS, MEANING THE COMPANY TYPICALLY BILLS CUSTOMERS IN THE CURRENT WEEK BASED ON THE PREVIOUS WEEK'S APPLICABLE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, OR DOE, INDEX.  THEREFORE, IN TIMES OF INCREASING FUEL PRICES, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOVER AS MUCH IN FUEL SURCHARGE REVENUE AS IT PAYS FOR FUEL.  IN PERIODS OF DECLINING PRICES, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.  THE KEY STATISTICS USED TO EVALUATE TRUCKING SEGMENT PERFORMANCE, NET OF FUEL SURCHARGE REVENUE, INCLUDE (I) BASE REVENUE PER AVAILABLE TRACTOR PER WEEK, (II) BASE REVENUE PER LOADED MILE, (III) LOADED MILES PER AVAILABLE TRACTOR PER WEEK, (IV) DEADHEAD PERCENTAGE, (V) AVERAGE LOADED MILES PER TRIP, (VI) AVERAGE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE TRACTORS AND (VII) ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO.  IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY'S LOADED MILES PER AVAILABLE TRACTOR PER WEEK, BASE REVENUE PER LOADED MILE AND DEADHEAD PERCENTAGE ARE AFFECTED BY INDUSTRY-WIDE FREIGHT VOLUMES, INDUSTRY-WIDE TRUCKING CAPACITY AND THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, WHICH FACTORS ARE MOSTLY BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL, AS WELL AS BY ITS SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS, SERVICE LEVELS AND EFFICIENCY OF ITS OPERATIONS, OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT CONTROL.  THE USAT LOGISTICS SEGMENT IS NON-ASSET BASED AND IS DEPENDENT UPON SKILLED EMPLOYEES, INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND THIRD-PARTY CAPACITY PROVIDERS.  THE LARGEST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE USAT LOGISTICS SEGMENT IS PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE.  OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES, WAGES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.  THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE USAT LOGISTICS SEGMENT BY REVIEWING GROSS MARGIN (USAT LOGISTICS OPERATING REVENUE LESS PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE) AND THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE (USAT LOGISTICS OPERATING REVENUE LESS PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF USAT LOGISTICS OPERATING REVENUE).  THE GROSS MARGIN CAN BE IMPACTED BY THE RATES CHARGED TO CUSTOMERS AND THE COSTS OF SECURING THIRD-PARTY CAPACITY.  USAT LOGISTICS OFTEN ACHIEVES BETTER GROSS MARGINS DURING PERIODS OF IMBALANCE BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND THAN TIMES OF BALANCED SUPPLY AND DEMAND, ALTHOUGH PERIODS OF TRANSITION TO TIGHT CAPACITY ALSO CAN COMPRESS MARGINS.  WE PLAN TO CONTINUE OUR FOCUS ON IMPROVING RESULTS THROUGH DISCIPLINED NETWORK MANAGEMENT AND PRICING, ENHANCED PARTNERSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS, AND IMPROVED EXECUTION IN OUR DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS OUR ONGOING SAFETY INITIATIVES.  BY FOCUSING ON THESE KEY OBJECTIVES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT WILL MAKE PROGRESS ON ITS GOALS OF IMPROVING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND INCREASING STOCKHOLDER VALUE.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN DOLLARS AND PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATING REVENUE AND THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF THOSE ITEMS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.  SEE \"USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\", \"CONSOLIDATED RECONCILIATIONS\" AND \"SEGMENT RECONCILIATIONS\" BELOW FOR THE USES AND LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO AND OTHER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION  THE COMPANY USES THE TERMS \"ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO\", \"ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE\", AND \"ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)\" THROUGHOUT THIS MD&A.  ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO, ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE, AND ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS), AS DEFINED HERE, ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AS DEFINED BY THE SEC.  MANAGEMENT USES ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO, ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE, AND ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) AS SUPPLEMENTS TO THE COMPANY'S GAAP RESULTS IN EVALUATING CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS, AS DISCUSSED BELOW.  ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO IS CALCULATED AS OPERATING EXPENSES EXCLUDING SEVERANCE COSTS INCLUDED IN SALARIES, WAGES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER COSTS (REVERSAL), AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION RELATED INTANGIBLES, AND TRANSACTION COSTS RELATING TO ACQUISITION, NET OF FUEL SURCHARGE REVENUE, AS A PERCENTAGE OF OPERATING REVENUE EXCLUDING FUEL SURCHARGE REVENUE.  ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE IS DEFINED AS EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE PLUS THE PER SHARE IMPACT OF SEVERANCE COSTS INCLUDED IN SALARIES, WAGES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER COSTS, AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION RELATED INTANGIBLES, AND TRANSACTION COSTS RELATED TO ACQUISITION, PLUS OR MINUS THE PER SHARE TAX IMPACT OF THOSE ADJUSTMENTS USING A STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATE.  THE PER SHARE IMPACT OF EACH ITEM IS DETERMINED BY DIVIDING IT BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING.  ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) IS DEFINED AS OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) EXCLUDING SEVERANCE COSTS INCLUDED IN SALARIES, WAGES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER COSTS, AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION RELATED INTANGIBLES, AND TRANSACTION COSTS RELATED TO ACQUISITION.  THE COMPANY'S CHIEF OPERATING DECISION-MAKER FOCUSES ON ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO, ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE AND ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) AS INDICATORS OF THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES REMOVING THE IMPACT OF THE ABOVE DESCRIBED ITEMS FROM THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AFFORDS A MORE CONSISTENT BASIS FOR COMPARING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ITS PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS AND OTHER USERS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES THEM THE SAME INFORMATION THAT WE USE INTERNALLY FOR PURPOSES OF ASSESSING OUR CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE ARE NOT SUBSTITUTES FOR OPERATING MARGIN OR ANY OTHER MEASURE DERIVED SOLELY FROM GAAP MEASURES.  THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO USING NON-GAAP MEASURES SUCH AS ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE.  ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE CAN MAKE AN EVALUATION OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE MORE CONSISTENT BECAUSE THESE MEASURES REMOVE ITEMS THAT, IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, DO NOT REFLECT ITS CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE, OTHER COMPANIES IN THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY MAY DEFINE ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE DIFFERENTLY.  AS A RESULT, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO USE ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO, ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE OR SIMILARLY NAMED NON-GAAP MEASURES THAT OTHER COMPANIES MAY USE, TO COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THOSE COMPANIES TO USA TRUCK'S PERFORMANCE.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF REGULATION S-K, RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED IN THE TABLES BELOW.

TRUCKING BASE REVENUE  (BEFORE INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATIONS) INCREASED 13.4% TO $83.4 MILLION, COMPARED TO $73.6 MILLION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  THE INCREASE IN OPERATING REVENUE WAS THE RESULT OF A 16.6% INCREASE IN AVERAGE NUMBER OF SEATED TRACTORS AND A 12.9% INCREASE IN TOTAL MILES DRIVEN AS A RESULT OF THE DAVIS TRANSFER ACQUISITION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY A 0.2% DECREASE IN BASE REVENUE PER LOADED MILE.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, TRUCKING OPERATING REVENUE (BEFORE INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATIONS) INCREASED 16.3% TO $191.4 MILLION, COMPARED TO $164.5 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018.  TRUCKING BASE REVENUE INCREASED 18.0% TO $166.6 MILLION, FROM $141.2 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE CHANGES IN OPERATING REVENUE AND BASE REVENUE RESULTED FROM A 20.7% INCREASE IN TRUCKING SHIPMENTS, WHICH FUELED A 12.0% INCREASE IN TOTAL MILES DRIVEN PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE DAVIS TRANSFER ACQUISITION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, A 5.4% INCREASE IN BASE REVENUE PER LOADED MILE AND A 10 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENT IN DEADHEAD PERCENTAGE.  TRUCKING OPERATING  INCOME  FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, TRUCKING REPORTED OPERATING INCOME OF $0.8 MILLION COMPARED TO $2.2 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THIS DECREASE WAS STEMMING FROM A 14.5% INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES AND A 0.2% DECREASE IN BASE REVENUE PER LOADED MILE, OFFSET BY THE 12.6% INCREASE IN OPERATING REVENUE (BEFORE INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATIONS) DISCUSSED ABOVE.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 44.8% TO $2.4 MILLION FROM $1.7 MILLION FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN 2018.  THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM THE 16.3% CHANGE IN OPERATING REVENUE DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN TOTAL MILES, ADDITIONAL SEATED TRACTORS THAT RESULTED FROM THE ACQUISITION OF DAVIS TRANSFER DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, AND 5.4% INCREASE IN BASE REVENUE PER LOADED MILE.  USAT LOGISTICS OPERATING REVENUE  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, USAT LOGISTICS OPERATING REVENUE (BEFORE INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATIONS) DECREASED 21.8% TO $39.6 MILLION COMPARED TO $50.6 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN OPERATING REVENUE WAS THE RESULT OF A 18.4% DECREASE IN REVENUE PER LOAD COMBINED WITH A 4.2% DECREASE IN LOAD VOLUME, RESULTING FROM A CHALLENGING FREIGHT ENVIRONMENT.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, OPERATING REVENUE DECREASED 16.8% TO $81.0 MILLION FROM $97.4 MILLION, FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN 2018, AS A RESULT OF THE 16.6% DECREASE IN REVENUE PER LOAD, PAIRED WITH A 0.3% DECREASE IN LOAD VOLUMES.  USAT LOGISTICS OPERATING INCOME  USAT LOGISTICS GENERATED OPERATING INCOME OF $1.1 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, A DECREASE OF $1.0 MILLION, OR 46.9%, COMPARED TO $2.2 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE 21.8% DECREASE IN OPERATING REVENUE (BEFORE INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATIONS), PAIRED WITH THE 4.2% DECREASE IN LOAD VOLUME CONTRIBUTED PRIMARILY TO THE DROP IN OPERATING INCOME.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 31.0% TO $3.5 MILLION FROM $5.0 MILLION FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN 2018.  THIS CHANGE WAS THE RESULT OF THE 16.8% DECREASE IN OPERATING REVENUE (BEFORE INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATIONS) MENTIONED ABOVE, DRIVEN BY THE DECREASE IN LOAD VOLUME AND REVENUE PER LOAD, OFFSET BY A 16.0% DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES (BEFORE INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATIONS).  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING EXPENSES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATING EXPENSES AND PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATING REVENUE, CONSOLIDATED BASE REVENUE AND THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF THOSE ITEMS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

(2)  CALCULATED AS FUEL AND FUEL TAXES, NET OF FUEL SURCHARGE REVENUE.  SALARIES, WAGES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS  THE INCREASES IN SALARIES, WAGES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPACT OF A DRIVER WAGE INCREASE GIVEN IN RECENT QUARTERS PAIRED WITH INCREASED TOTAL REVENUE MILES OF 12.9% AND 12.0%, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION OF DAVIS TRANSFER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018.  THE RATE OF COMPENSATION PAID TO COMPANY DRIVERS PER MILE HAS INCREASED IN RECENT PERIODS AND WE EXPECT THIS COST WILL INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS DUE TO DRIVER PAY INCREASES, THE MOST RECENT OF WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.  THIS EXPENSE ITEM WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE PERCENTAGE OF TRUCKING MILES OPERATED BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS INSTEAD OF COMPANY EMPLOYED DRIVERS.  FUEL AND FUEL TAXES  FUEL AND FUEL TAXES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF DIESEL FUEL EXPENSE FOR COMPANY-OWNED TRACTORS AND FUEL TAXES.  THE PRIMARY FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S FUEL EXPENSE ARE THE COST OF DIESEL FUEL, THE FUEL ECONOMY OF COMPANY EQUIPMENT AND THE NUMBER OF MILES DRIVEN BY COMPANY DRIVERS.  THE INCREASES IN FUEL AND FUEL TAXES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 IS THE RESULT OF THE 12.9% AND 12.0% INCREASES, RESPECTIVELY, IN TOTAL MILES DRIVEN WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, OFFSET BY A 2.3% DECREASE IN THE PRICE PER GALLON OF DIESEL FUEL.  THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE INCREASE IN REVENUE MILES WAS THE PURCHASE OF DAVIS TRANSFER DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018.  THE COMPANY HAS UNDERTAKEN FUEL EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES, SUCH AS INSTALLING TRAILER SKIRTS, IDLE CONTROL, MORE FUEL-EFFICIENT ENGINES AND IMPLEMENTING DRIVER TRAINING PROGRAMS, WHICH HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR FUEL EXPENSE ON A COST PER COMPANY TRACTOR MILE BASIS.  IN FUTURE PERIODS, MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THE COMPANY'S NET FUEL EXPENSE TO FLUCTUATE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS DIESEL FUEL PRICES, PERCENTAGE RECOVERED FROM FUEL SURCHARGE PROGRAMS, DEADHEAD PERCENTAGE, THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE GENERATED FROM INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THE SUCCESS OF FUEL EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE MANAGING ITS IDLE TIME AND TRUCK SPEEDS AND PARTNERING WITH CUSTOMERS TO ADJUST FUEL SURCHARGE PROGRAMS TO RECOVER A FAIR PORTION OF RISING FUEL COSTS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND  EQUIPMENT  RENT  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF DEPRECIATION FOR COMPANY-OWNED TRACTORS AND TRAILERS AND AMORTIZATION OF THOSE FINANCED WITH CAPITAL LEASES.  THE PRIMARY FACTORS AFFECTING THIS EXPENSE INCLUDE THE NUMBER AND AGE OF COMPANY TRACTORS AND TRAILERS, THE ACQUISITION COST OF NEW EQUIPMENT AND THE SALVAGE VALUES AND USEFUL LIVES ASSIGNED TO THE EQUIPMENT.  EQUIPMENT RENT EXPENSES ARE THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES.  THESE LARGELY FIXED COSTS FLUCTUATE AS A PERCENTAGE OF BASE REVENUE PRIMARILY WITH INCREASES AND DECREASES IN AVERAGE BASE REVENUE PER TRACTOR AND THE PERCENTAGE OF BASE REVENUE CONTRIBUTED BY TRUCKING VERSUS USAT LOGISTICS.  FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, EQUIPMENT RENT EXPENSE INCREASED 19.4% AND 8.6% IN TERMS OF DOLLARS SPENT, BUT REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT AS A PERCENTAGE OF BOTH OPERATING AND BASE REVENUE WHEN COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF BOTH OPERATING AND BASE REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, DUE IN PART TO THE DAVIS TRANSFER ACQUISITION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2018 AND LOWER REVENUES AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY.  THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON IMPROVING ASSET UTILIZATION, MATCHING CUSTOMER DEMAND AND STRENGTHENING LOAD PROFITABILITY INITIATIVES.  FURTHER, THE ACQUISITION COSTS OF NEW REVENUE EQUIPMENT COULD INCREASE DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF IMPROVED SAFETY AND FUEL EFFICIENCY FEATURES.  AS A RESULT, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS TO SEE AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FROM NEW TRACTORS, AND EXPECTS EQUIPMENT RENT TO INCREASE AS THE USE OF OPERATING LEASES INCREASES.  INSURANCE AND CLAIMS  INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE CONSISTS OF INSURANCE PREMIUM AND EXPERIENCE EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS FOR THIRD-PARTY BODILY INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, CARGO DAMAGE AND OTHER CASUALTY EVENTS.  THE PRIMARY FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE ARE THE NUMBER OF MILES DRIVEN BY ITS COMPANY DRIVERS AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF ACCIDENTS, TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT FACTORS USED IN THE COMPANY'S ACTUARIAL DEVELOPMENTS IN PRIOR-YEAR CLAIMS, INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND SELF-INSURED AMOUNTS.  FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE INCREASED MORE THAN 30% IN EACH PERIOD AND INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF BOTH OPERATING AND BASE REVENUE COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR 2018 PERIODS.  THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE OPERATIONS OF DAVIS TRANSFER, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, AND INCREASED AUTO LIABILITY EXPENSES DURING THE QUARTER.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY EXPECTS INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE TO CONTINUE TO BE VARIABLE OVER THE LONG-TERM.  IN ADDITION, INSURANCE CARRIERS HAVE GENERALLY RAISED PREMIUMS FOR MANY BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY, AND THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE COULD INCREASE IF IT HAS A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE AT RENEWAL OR REPLACEMENT, OR THE COMPANY COULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO RAISE ITS SELF-INSURED RETENTION LEVELS OR DECREASE ITS AGGREGATE COVERAGE LIMITS.  OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE  OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF VEHICLE REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND OTHER COSTS.  OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES ARE PRIMARILY AFFECTED BY THE AGE OF THE COMPANY'S FLEET OF TRACTORS AND TRAILERS, THE NUMBER OF MILES DRIVEN IN A PERIOD AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, BY EFFICIENCY MEASURES IN THE COMPANY'S MAINTENANCE FACILITIES.  THE DECREASES IN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 WAS THE RESULT OF MAINTENANCE COST SAVINGS STEMMING FROM THE PURCHASE OF NEW REVENUE EQUIPMENT, COMBINED WITH ONGOING COST SAVING INITIATIVES UNDERTAKEN BY MANAGEMENT.  PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION  PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION CONSISTS OF THE PAYMENTS THE COMPANY MAKES TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, RAILROADS AND THIRD-PARTY CARRIERS THAT HAUL LOADS BROKERED TO THEM BY THE COMPANY, INCLUDING FUEL SURCHARGE REIMBURSEMENT PAID TO SUCH PARTIES.  FOR BOTH THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE DECREASED DUE TO A SOFTENING SPOT MARKET, WHICH LEADS TO PRICE CONCESSIONS FROM THIRD PARTY CARRIERS.  LOSS (GAIN) ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, NET  DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, LOSS (GAIN) ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, NET, CHANGED UNFAVORABLY WHEN COMPARED TO THE GAINS IN THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM VOLATILITY IN THE USED EQUIPMENT MARKET, WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES MAY CONTINUE TO SHOW VARIABILITY IN 2019 AND BEYOND.  OTHER EXPENSES  THE INCREASES IN OTHER EXPENSES DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF INCREASED PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.  INTEREST EXPENSE  FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF DAVIS TRANSFER DURING THE FALL QUARTER OF 2018 AND NEW REVENUE EQUIPMENT.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS DEBT OUTSTANDING ON THE CREDIT FACILITY BY APPROXIMATELY $2.0 MILLION.  SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S CREDIT FACILITY.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 99.5% AND 24.4%, RESPECTIVELY.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 33.5% AND 25.7%, RESPECTIVELY.  THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, WHEN COMPARED TO THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 21%, IS PRIMARILY AFFECTED BY STATE INCOME TAXES, NET OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX EFFECT, AND PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH IS THE EFFECT OF THE PARTIALLY NON-DEDUCTIBLE PER DIEM PAY STRUCTURE FOR OUR DRIVERS.  DRIVERS MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE NON-TAXABLE PER DIEM PAY IN LIEU OF A PORTION OF THEIR TAXABLE WAGES.  THIS PER DIEM PROGRAM INCREASES THE COMPANY'S DRIVERS\u2019 NET PAY PER MILE, AFTER TAXES, WHILE DECREASING GROSS PAY, BEFORE TAXES.  PER DIEM PAY IS PARTIALLY NON-DEDUCTIBLE BY THE COMPANY UNDER CURRENT IRS REGULATIONS.  AS A RESULT, SALARIES, WAGES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS COSTS ARE SLIGHTLY LOWER AND EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES ARE HIGHER THAN THE STATUTORY RATE.  DUE TO THE PARTIALLY NON-DEDUCTIBLE EFFECT OF PER DIEM PAY, THE COMPANY'S TAX RATE WILL CHANGE BASED ON FLUCTUATIONS IN EARNINGS (LOSSES) AND IN THE NUMBER OF DRIVERS WHO ELECT TO RECEIVE THIS PAY STRUCTURE.  GENERALLY, AS PRETAX INCOME OR LOSS INCREASES, THE IMPACT OF THE DRIVER PER DIEM PROGRAM ON THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASES, BECAUSE AGGREGATE PER DIEM PAY BECOMES SMALLER IN RELATION TO PRETAX INCOME OR LOSS, WHILE IN PERIODS WHERE EARNINGS ARE AT OR NEAR BREAKEVEN THE IMPACT OF THE PER DIEM PROGRAM ON THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE CAN BE SIGNIFICANT. DUE TO THE EFFECT OF THE NON-DEDUCTIBLE PER DIEM PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY'S TAX RATE WILL FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS BASED ON FLUCTUATIONS IN EARNINGS (LOSSES) AND IN THE NUMBER OF DRIVERS WHO ELECT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PER DIEM PROGRAM.  WHEN THE RESULT OF THE EXPECTED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS NOT DEEMED RELIABLE AND DISTORTS THE INCOME TAX PROVISION FOR AN INTERIM PERIOD, THE COMPANY CALCULATES THE INCOME TAX PROVISION OR BENEFIT USING THE CUT-OFF METHOD, WHICH RESULTS IN AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OR BENEFIT BASED SOLELY ON THE YEAR-TO-DATE PRETAX INCOME OR LOSS AS ADJUSTED FOR PERMANENT DIFFERENCES ON A PRO RATA BASIS.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD THE COMPANY'S TAX RATE WAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY VESTING OF EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION AT A LOWER STOCK PRICE THAN THE PRICE AT WHICH IT WAS GRANTED, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE TO TAX EXPENSE AND THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  SEASONALITY  IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY, REVENUE TYPICALLY FOLLOWS A SEASONAL PATTERN FOR VARIOUS COMMODITIES AND CUSTOMER BUSINESSES.  PEAK FREIGHT DEMAND HAS HISTORICALLY OCCURRED IN THE MONTHS OF SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER.  AFTER THE DECEMBER HOLIDAY SEASON AND DURING THE REMAINING WINTER MONTHS, FREIGHT VOLUMES ARE TYPICALLY LOWER AS MANY CUSTOMERS REDUCE SHIPMENT LEVELS.  OPERATING EXPENSES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHER IN THE WINTER MONTHS DUE PRIMARILY TO DECREASED FUEL EFFICIENCY, INCREASED COLD WEATHER-RELATED MAINTENANCE COSTS OF REVENUE EQUIPMENT AND INCREASED INSURANCE AND CLAIMS COSTS ATTRIBUTED TO ADVERSE WINTER DRIVING CONDITIONS.  REVENUE CAN ALSO BE IMPACTED BY WEATHER, HOLIDAYS AND THE NUMBER OF BUSINESS DAYS THAT OCCUR DURING A GIVEN PERIOD, AS REVENUE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE AVAILABLE WORKING DAYS OF SHIPPERS.  INFLATION  MOST OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING EXPENSES ARE INFLATION SENSITIVE, AND AS SUCH, ARE NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO BE OFFSET THROUGH INCREASES IN REVENUE PER MILE AND COST CONTROL EFFORTS.  THE EFFECT OF INFLATION-DRIVEN COST INCREASES ON OVERALL OPERATING COSTS IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE GREATER FOR THE COMPANY THAN FOR ITS COMPETITORS.  FUEL AVAILABILITY AND COST  THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY IS DEPENDENT UPON THE AVAILABILITY OF FUEL. IN THE PAST, FUEL SHORTAGES OR INCREASES IN FUEL TAXES OR FUEL COSTS HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR PROFITABILITY AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTY IN MAINTAINING NECESSARY FUEL SUPPLIES, AND IN THE PAST HAS GENERALLY BEEN ABLE TO PARTIALLY OFFSET INCREASES IN FUEL COSTS AND FUEL TAXES THROUGH INCREASED FREIGHT RATES AND THROUGH A FUEL SURCHARGE THAT INCREASES INCREMENTALLY AS THE AVERAGE PRICE OF FUEL INCREASES ABOVE AN AGREED UPON BASELINE PRICE PER GALLON.  TYPICALLY, THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO FULLY RECOVER INCREASES IN FUEL PRICES THROUGH FREIGHT RATE INCREASES AND FUEL SURCHARGES, PRIMARILY BECAUSE THOSE ITEMS ARE NOT AVAILABLE WITH RESPECT TO EMPTY AND OUT-OF-ROUTE MILES AND IDLING TIME, FOR WHICH THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT RECEIVE COMPENSATION FROM CUSTOMERS.  ADDITIONALLY, MOST FUEL SURCHARGES ARE BASED ON THE AVERAGE FUEL PRICE AS PUBLISHED BY THE DOE FOR THE WEEK PRIOR TO THE SHIPMENT, MEANING THE COMPANY TYPICALLY BILLS CUSTOMERS IN THE CURRENT WEEK BASED ON THE PREVIOUS WEEK'S APPLICABLE INDEX.  ACCORDINGLY, IN TIMES OF INCREASING FUEL PRICES, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOVER AS MUCH AS IT IS CURRENTLY PAYING FOR FUEL. IN PERIODS OF DECLINING PRICES, FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THE INVERSE IS TRUE.  OVERALL, AVERAGE DIESEL FUEL PRICES PER GALLON, AS REPORTED BY THE DOE, DECLINED 2.3% AND 1.2%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY LONG-TERM FUEL PURCHASE CONTRACTS, AND HAS NOT ENTERED INTO ANY FUEL HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS.  EQUITY  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY OF $84.0 MILLION AND TOTAL DEBT AND LEASE LIABILITIES INCLUDING CURRENT MATURITIES AND INSURANCE PREMIUM FINANCING, OF $192.7 MILLION, RESULTING IN A TOTAL DEBT, LESS CASH, TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION RATIO OF 69.6% COMPARED TO 66.2% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018.  PURCHASES AND COMMITMENTS  THE COMPANY ROUTINELY MONITORS EQUIPMENT ACQUISITION NEEDS AND ADJUSTS PURCHASE SCHEDULES FROM TIME TO TIME BASED ON ANALYSIS OF FACTORS SUCH AS NEW EQUIPMENT PRICES, THE CONDITION OF THE USED EQUIPMENT MARKET, DEMAND FOR FREIGHT SERVICES, PREVAILING INTEREST RATES, TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS, FUEL EFFICIENCY, EQUIPMENT DURABILITY, EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATIONS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED DRIVERS.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD $26.1 MILLION IN NONCANCELLABLE COMMITMENTS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF BOTH REVENUE AND NON-REVENUE EQUIPMENT.  WE ANTICIPATE FUNDING THESE COMMITMENTS WITH OPERATING AND FINANCING CASH FLOWS OR LEASES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  USA TRUCK\u2019S BUSINESS HAS REQUIRED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE, SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.  IN THE COMPANY'S TRUCKING SEGMENT, WHERE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ARE THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL, THE PRIMARY INVESTMENTS ARE IN NEW REVENUE EQUIPMENT AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, IN TECHNOLOGY AND WORKING CAPITAL.  IN THE COMPANY'S USAT LOGISTICS SEGMENT, WHERE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY MORE MODEST, THE PRIMARY INVESTMENTS ARE IN TECHNOLOGY AND WORKING CAPITAL. USA TRUCK'S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY HAVE BEEN FUNDS PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS, BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMPANY'S CREDIT FACILITY, SALES OF USED REVENUE EQUIPMENT, AND FINANCE AND OPERATING LEASES.  BASED ON EXPECTED FINANCIAL CONDITIONS, NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, RESULTS  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OF OPERATIONS AND RELATED NET CASH FLOWS AND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY'S SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY TO BE ADEQUATE TO MEET CURRENT AND PROJECTED NEEDS.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS A SINGLE FINANCIAL COVENANT, WHICH REQUIRES A CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 1.0 TO 1.0 THAT IS TRIGGERED IN THE EVENT EXCESS AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FALLS BELOW 10% OF THE LENDERS' TOTAL COMMITMENTS.  ALSO, CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS REGARDING THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS, MAKE CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, PREPAY CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS, EXECUTE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS AND ENTER INTO CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS ARE TRIGGERED IN THE EVENT EXCESS AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FALLS BELOW 10% OF THE LENDERS' TOTAL COMMITMENTS.  LONG-TERM DEBT, FINANCING NOTES AND LEASE LIABILITIES INCREASED TO $192.7 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $32.2 MILLION FROM $160.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD $5.4 MILLION IN LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING AND HAD APPROXIMATELY $59.0 MILLION AVAILABLE TO BORROW UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BORROWING BASE AVAILABILITY.  NET OF CASH, DEBT REPRESENTED 69.6% OF TOTAL CAPITALIZATION.  FLUCTUATIONS IN THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE AND RELATED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND THE TIMING AND NATURE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ADDITIONS THAT ARE NOT FUNDED THROUGH OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING, AS WELL AS THE NATURE AND TIMING OF RECEIPT OF PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSALS OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.  CASH FLOWS  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30,  2019  2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $15,754  $18,428  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (17,871)  (1,522)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  1,326  (16,948)  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  \u2013 NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $2.7 MILLION IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A $10.3 MILLION INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLES PAIRED WITH A $2.1 MILLION DECREASE IN NET INCOME, OFFSET BY A $3.3 MILLION INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, A $3.6 MILLION INCREASE IN DEFERRED TAXES, A $2.1 MILLION INCREASE IN INVENTORIES, AND A $1.1 MILLION INCREASE IN SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  \u2013 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $17.9 MILLION, COMPARED TO $1.5 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THE $16.3 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A $20.9 MILLION INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE 2019 PERIOD, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $4.9 MILLION IN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IN THE 2019 PERIOD COMPARED TO THE 2018 PERIOD.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  \u2013 CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $1.3 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $16.9 MILLION USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THE $18.3 MILLION CHANGE WAS DUE TO THE $10.5 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM A SALE LEASEBACK TRANSACTION COMPLETED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, INCREASED BORROWINGS OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $36.2 MILLION, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $28.9 MILLION IN PAYMENTS ON LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS.  AT JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD BORROWINGS OF LONG-TERM DEBT, FINANCING NOTES AND LEASE LIABILITIES OF $192.7 MILLION, UP FROM $160.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018.  DEBT AND LEASE OBLIGATIONS  SEE NOTES 8, 9, AND 10 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE FINANCING, CREDIT FACILITY AND LEASE OBLIGATIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES.  THE COMPANY BASES ITS ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT TRENDS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES TO BE RELEVANT AT THE TIME ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES, AND SUCH DIFFERENCES COULD BE MATERIAL.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW AND TRENDS  OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, MACHINE CLOTHING (MC) AND ALBANY ENGINEERED COMPOSITES (AEC), DRAW ON THE SAME ADVANCED TEXTILES AND MATERIALS PROCESSING CAPABILITIES, AND COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF PRODUCT-BASED ADVANTAGE THAT IS GROUNDED IN THOSE CORE CAPABILITIES.  THE MC SEGMENT IS THE COMPANY\u2019S LONG-ESTABLISHED CORE BUSINESS AND PRIMARY GENERATOR OF CASH. WHILE IT HAS SUFFERED FROM WELL-DOCUMENTED DECLINES IN PUBLICATION GRADES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S TRADITIONAL MARKETS, THE PAPER AND PAPERBOARD INDUSTRY IS STILL EXPECTED TO GROW SLIGHTLY ON A GLOBAL BASIS, DRIVEN BY DEMAND FOR PACKAGING AND TISSUE GRADES, AS WELL AS THE EXPANSION OF PAPER CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION IN ASIA AND SOUTH AMERICA. WE FEEL WE ARE NOW WELL-POSITIONED IN KEY MARKETS, WITH HIGH-QUALITY, LOW-COST PRODUCTION IN GROWTH MARKETS, SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER FIXED COSTS IN MATURE MARKETS, AND CONTINUED STRENGTH IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, TECHNICAL PRODUCT SUPPORT, AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY. BECAUSE OF PRICING PRESSURES AND INDUSTRY OVERCAPACITY, THE MACHINE CLOTHING AND PAPER INDUSTRIES WILL CONTINUE TO FACE TOP LINE PRESSURE. DESPITE CONTINUED MARKET PRESSURE ON REVENUE, THE BUSINESS RETAINS THE POTENTIAL FOR MAINTAINING STABLE EARNINGS IN THE FUTURE. IT HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT GENERATOR OF CASH, AND WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN THE CASH-GENERATING POTENTIAL OF THIS BUSINESS BY MAINTAINING THE LOW COSTS THAT WE ACHIEVED THROUGH CONTINUOUS FOCUS ON COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES, AND COMPETING VIGOROUSLY BY USING OUR DIFFERENTIATED AND TECHNICALLY SUPERIOR PRODUCTS TO REDUCE OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 TOTAL COST OF OPERATION AND IMPROVE THEIR PAPER QUALITY.  THE AEC SEGMENT PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT GROWTH POTENTIAL FOR OUR COMPANY BOTH NEAR AND LONG TERM. OUR STRATEGY IS TO GROW BY FOCUSING OUR PROPRIETARY 3D-WOVEN TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS OUR NON-3D TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES, ON HIGH-VALUE AEROSPACE (BOTH COMMERCIAL AND DEFENSE) APPLICATIONS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PERFORMING SUCCESSFULLY ON OUR PORTFOLIO OF GROWTH PROGRAMS. AEC (INCLUDING ALBANY SAFRAN COMPOSITES, LLC (ASC), IN WHICH OUR CUSTOMER SAFRAN GROUP OWNS A 10 PERCENT NONCONTROLLING INTEREST) SUPPLIES A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. AEC\u2019S LARGEST AEROSPACE CUSTOMER IS THE SAFRAN GROUP AND SALES TO SAFRAN, THROUGH ASC, (CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF FAN BLADES AND CASES FOR CFM\u2019S LEAP ENGINE) ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 19 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IN 2018. AEC, THROUGH ASC, ALSO SUPPLIES 3D-WOVEN COMPOSITE FAN CASES FOR THE GE9X ENGINE. AEC\u2019S CURRENT PORTFOLIO OF NON-3D PROGRAMS INCLUDES COMPONENTS FOR THE F-35, FUSELAGE COMPONENTS FOR THE BOEING 787, COMPONENTS FOR THE CH-53K HELICOPTER, VACUUM WASTE TANKS FOR BOEING 7-SERIES AIRCRAFT, AND MISSILE BODIES FOR LOCKHEED MARTIN\u2019S JASSM AIR-TO-SURFACE MISSILES. AEC IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN RESEARCH TO DEVELOP NEW APPLICATIONS IN BOTH COMMERCIAL AND DEFENSE AIRCRAFT ENGINE AND AIRFRAME MARKETS. IN 2018, APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT OF AEC SALES WERE RELATED TO U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS OR PROGRAMS.  32  INDEX  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NET SALES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR NET SALES BY BUSINESS SEGMENT.

THE MAJORITY OF THESE COUNTRIES HAD INCOME TAX RATES THAT ARE ABOVE THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX RATE OF 21% DURING THE PERIODS REPORTED. THE JURISDICTIONAL LOCATION OF EARNINGS IS A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE EACH YEAR. THE RATE IMPACT OF THIS COMPONENT IS INFLUENCED BY THE SPECIFIC LOCATION OF NON-U.S. EARNINGS AND THE LEVEL OF OUR TOTAL EARNINGS. FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, THE JURISDICTIONAL MIX OF EARNINGS CAN VARY AS A RESULT OF OPERATING FLUCTUATIONS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, AS WELL AS THE EXTENT AND LOCATION OF OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE ITEMS, SUCH AS PENSION SETTLEMENT AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  MACHINE CLOTHING SEGMENT  MACHINE CLOTHING IS OUR PRIMARY BUSINESS SEGMENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR 57% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019. MC PRODUCTS ARE PURCHASED PRIMARILY BY MANUFACTURERS OF PAPER AND PAPERBOARD.  ACCORDING TO RISI, INC., GLOBAL PRODUCTION OF PAPER AND PAPERBOARD IS EXPECTED TO GROW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 1 PERCENT OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY GLOBAL GROWTH IN PACKAGING AND TISSUE, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE GREATER THAN EXPECTED DECLINES IN PUBLICATION GRADES.  37  INDEX  WHILE THE MC BUSINESS HAS SUFFERED FROM WELL-DOCUMENTED DECLINES IN PUBLICATION GRADES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S TRADITIONAL MARKETS, THE PAPER AND PAPERBOARD INDUSTRY IS STILL EXPECTED TO GROW SLIGHTLY ON A GLOBAL BASIS, DRIVEN BY DEMAND FOR PACKAGING AND TISSUE GRADES. WE FEEL WE ARE NOW WELL-POSITIONED IN THESE MARKETS, WITH HIGH-QUALITY, LOW-COST PRODUCTION IN GROWTH MARKETS, SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER FIXED COSTS IN MATURE MARKETS, AND CONTINUED STRENGTH IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, TECHNICAL PRODUCT SUPPORT, AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY. RECENT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN PAPER MACHINE CLOTHING, WHILE CONTRIBUTING TO THE PAPERMAKING EFFICIENCY OF CUSTOMERS, HAVE LENGTHENED THE USEFUL LIFE OF MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND HAD AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OVERALL PAPER MACHINE CLOTHING DEMAND.  THE COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCT PLATFORMS POSITION US WELL TO MEET THESE SHIFTING DEMANDS ACROSS PRODUCT GRADES AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. OUR STRATEGY FOR MEETING THESE CHALLENGES CONTINUES TO BE TO GROW SHARE IN ALL MARKETS, WITH NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY, AND TO MAINTAIN OUR MANUFACTURING FOOTPRINT TO ALIGN WITH GLOBAL DEMAND, WHILE WE OFFSET THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION THROUGH CONTINUOUS PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT.  WE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT RESTRUCTURING CHARGES IN RECENT PERIODS AS WE REDUCED MC MANUFACTURING CAPACITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE POSITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND FRANCE.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT AEC PROGRAMS INCLUDE COMPONENTS FOR THE F-35, FUSELAGE FRAMES FOR THE BOEING 787, COMPONENTS FOR THE CH53-K HELICOPTER, AND THE FAN CASE FOR THE GE9X ENGINE.  A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, HAVE ISSUED ORDERS GROUNDING BOEING 737 MAX 8 AND/OR MAX 9 AIRCRAFT. IF THESE RECENT GROUNDINGS CAUSE A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR, OR PRODUCTION OF, THIS AIRCRAFT, IT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON DEMAND FOR THE LEAP 1B ENGINE VARIANT, WHICH COULD IN TURN HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON DEMAND FOR THE PARTS WE SUPPLY FOR SUCH ENGINE. SUCH GROUNDINGS ARE ALSO LIKELY TO RESULT IN NEAR-TERM DELAYS OR INTERRUPTIONS IN PLANNED PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF THE COMPONENTS THAT WE SUPPLY FOR SUCH ENGINE VARIANT; SUCH INTERRUPTIONS OR DELAYS WOULD LIKELY REDUCE AEC\u2019S LEAP-RELATED SALES AND EARNINGS IN THE PERIODS IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

LONG-TERM CONTRACTS  AEC HAS CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING ITS CONTRACT FOR THE LEAP PROGRAM, WHERE REVENUE IS DETERMINED BY A COST-PLUS FEE AGREEMENT. REVENUE EARNED UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT OF SEGMENT REVENUE FOR EACH OF THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 AND 2018.  IN ADDITION, AEC HAS LONG-TERM CONTRACTS IN WHICH THE SELLING PRICE IS FIXED. IN ACCOUNTING FOR THOSE CONTRACTS, WE ESTIMATE THE PROFIT MARGIN EXPECTED AT THE COMPLETION OF THE CONTRACT AND RECOGNIZE A PRO-RATA SHARE OF THAT PROFIT DURING THE COURSE OF THE CONTRACT USING A COST-TO-COST APPROACH. CHANGES IN ESTIMATED CONTRACT PROFITABILITY WILL AFFECT REVENUE AND GROSS PROFIT WHEN THE CHANGE OCCURS, WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE EFFECT ON REVENUE AND GROSS PROFIT IN ANY REPORTING PERIOD.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $83.1 MILLION AND $16.7 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE NET INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2019 WAS DUE TO INCREASED PROFITABILITY IN BOTH MC AND AEC, AND IMPROVED MANAGEMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL THAT RESULTED FROM A NUMBER OF IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES.  CASH PAID FOR INCOME TAXES WAS $17.4 MILLION AND $14.0 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN WITHHOLDING TAXES PAID ON BEHALF OF SWITZERLAND RELATED TO DIVIDEND PAYMENTS MADE TO SWITZERLAND AND AN INCREASE IN CORPORATE INCOME TAX PAYMENTS DUE TO INCREASED PRE-TAX INCOME IN MEXICO AND AN INCREASE IN STATE CORPORATE INCOME TAX PAYMENTS IN 2019 IN THE US.  AT JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD $215.2 MILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, OF WHICH $157.7 MILLION WAS HELD BY SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.  INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS WERE $35.5 MILLION IN 2019 AND $39.2 MILLION IN 2018.  DIVIDENDS HAVE BEEN DECLARED EACH QUARTER SINCE THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001. DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO WHETHER A DIVIDEND WILL BE PAID, AND THE AMOUNT OF THE DIVIDEND, ARE MADE BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EACH QUARTER. TO THE EXTENT, THE BOARD DECLARES CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, WE EXPECT TO PAY SUCH DIVIDENDS OUT OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS. FUTURE CASH DIVIDENDS WILL ALSO DEPEND ON DEBT COVENANTS AND ON THE BOARD\u2019S ASSESSMENT OF OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE FINANCE OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY WITH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS, LARGELY THROUGH OUR REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT AS DISCUSSED BELOW. OUR SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES MAY ALSO MAINTAIN WORKING CAPITAL LINES WITH LOCAL BANKS, BUT BORROWINGS UNDER SUCH LOCAL FACILITIES TEND NOT  41  INDEX  TO BE SIGNIFICANT. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CASH BALANCE AT JUNE 30, 2019 WAS HELD BY NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. BASED ON CASH ON HAND AND CREDIT FACILITIES, WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE COMPANY HAS SUFFICIENT CAPITAL RESOURCES TO OPERATE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL DEBT COVENANTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2019.  ON NOVEMBER 7, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A $685 MILLION UNSECURED FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WHICH AMENDED AND RESTATED THE PRIOR $550 MILLION AGREEMENT, ENTERED INTO ON APRIL 8, 2016 (THE \u201cPRIOR AGREEMENT\u201d). UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, $482 MILLION OF BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF JUNE 30, 2019. THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE FOR BORROWINGS WAS LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD, BASED ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO AT THE TIME OF BORROWING. AT THE TIME OF THE LAST BORROWING ON JUNE 17, 2019, THE SPREAD WAS 1.375%. THE SPREAD WAS BASED ON A PRICING GRID, WHICH RANGED FROM 1.250% TO 1.750%, BASED ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO. BASED ON OUR MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO AND OUR CONSOLIDATED EBITDA, AND WITHOUT MODIFICATION TO ANY OTHER CREDIT AGREEMENTS, AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BORROW AN ADDITIONAL $203 MILLION UNDER THE AGREEMENT.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAVE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED PURSUANT TO ITEM 303(A)(4) OF REGULATION S-K.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  THE INFORMATION SET FORTH UNDER NOTE 19 CONTAINED IN ITEM 1, \u201cNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u201d, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  NON-GAAP MEASURES  THIS FORM 10-Q CONTAINS CERTAIN NON-GAAP MEASURES, INCLUDING: NET SALES, AND PERCENT CHANGE IN NET SALES, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION EFFECTS (FOR EACH SEGMENT AND ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS); EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA (FOR EACH SEGMENT AND ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS REPRESENTED IN DOLLARS OR AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES); NET DEBT AND CHANGES IN NET DEBT EXCLUDING REDUCTIONS IN BOTH DUE TO THE EFFECT OF CHANGES TO THE TREATMENT OF LEASES DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF ASC 842; AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (OR ADJUSTED EPS). SUCH ITEMS ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THEY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS REGARDING THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE.  PRESENTING NET SALES AND INCREASES OR DECREASES IN NET SALES, AFTER CURRENCY EFFECTS ARE EXCLUDED, CAN GIVE MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS INSIGHT INTO UNDERLYING SALES TRENDS. NET SALES, OR PERCENT CHANGES IN NET SALES, EXCLUDING CURRENCY RATE EFFECTS, ARE CALCULATED BY CONVERTING AMOUNTS REPORTED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT THE EXCHANGE RATE OF A PRIOR PERIOD. THESE AMOUNTS ARE THEN COMPARED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNT AS REPORTED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EPS ARE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT RELATE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTINUING OPERATIONS. EBITDA, OR NET INCOME WITH INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION ADDED BACK, IS A COMMON INDICATOR OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE USED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO ANALYZE AND COMPARE CORE PROFITABILITY BETWEEN COMPANIES AND INDUSTRIES BECAUSE IT ELIMINATES EFFECTS DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN FINANCING, ASSET BASES AND TAXES. THE COMPANY CALCULATES EBITDA BY REMOVING THE FOLLOWING FROM NET INCOME: INTEREST EXPENSE NET, INCOME TAX EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CALCULATED BY: ADDING TO EBITDA COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRUCTURING, AND INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH DISCONTINUED BUSINESSES; CHARGES AND CREDITS RELATED TO PENSION PLAN SETTLEMENTS; ADDING (OR SUBTRACTING) REVALUATION LOSSES (OR GAINS); SUBTRACTING (OR ADDING) GAINS (OR LOSSES) FROM THE SALE OF BUILDINGS OR INVESTMENTS; SUBTRACTING INSURANCE RECOVERY GAINS IN EXCESS OF PREVIOUSLY RECORDED LOSSES; AND SUBTRACTING (OR ADDING) INCOME (OR LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN ALBANY SAFRAN COMPOSITES (ASC). ADJUSTED EBITDA MAY ALSO BE PRESENTED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES BY DIVIDING IT BY NET SALES. AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT IN A PARTICULAR QUARTER OF SPECIFIC RESTRUCTURING COSTS, CURRENCY REVALUATION, INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH DISCONTINUED BUSINESSES, OR OTHER GAINS AND LOSSES, ON NET INCOME (ABSOLUTE AS WELL AS ON A PER-SHARE BASIS), OPERATING INCOME OR EBITDA CAN GIVE MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS ADDITIONAL INSIGHT INTO CORE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED TO QUARTERS IN WHICH SUCH ITEMS HAD A GREATER OR LESSER EFFECT, OR NO EFFECT. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES IN THE MC SEGMENT, WHILE FREQUENT IN RECENT YEARS, ARE REFLECTIVE OF SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN MANUFACTURING CAPACITY AND ASSOCIATED  42  INDEX  HEADCOUNT IN RESPONSE TO SHIFTING MARKETS, AND NOT OF THE PROFITABILITY OF THE BUSINESS GOING FORWARD AS RESTRUCTURED. ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (ADJUSTED EPS) IS CALCULATED BY ADDING TO (OR SUBTRACTING FROM) NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY PER SHARE, ON AN AFTER-TAX BASIS: RESTRUCTURING CHARGES; CHARGES AND CREDITS RELATED TO PENSION PLAN SETTLEMENTS AND CURTAILMENTS; INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH DISCONTINUED BUSINESSES; FOREIGN CURRENCY REVALUATION LOSSES (OR GAINS); ACQUISITION EXPENSES; AND LOSSES (OR GAINS) FROM THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS.  EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AND ADJUSTED EPS, AS DEFINED BY THE COMPANY, MAY NOT BE SIMILAR TO SIMILARLY NAMED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. SUCH MEASURES ARE NOT CONSIDERED MEASUREMENTS UNDER GAAP, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, BUT NOT AS SUBSTITUTES FOR, THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  WE OPERATE IN THREE REPORTABLE  SEGMENTS: MANUFACTURING; WHEELS, REPAIR & PARTS; AND LEASING & SERVICES. OUR SEGMENTS ARE OPERATIONALLY INTEGRATED. THE MANUFACTURING SEGMENT, WHICH CURRENTLY OPERATES FROM FACILITIES IN THE U.S., MEXICO, POLAND, ROMANIA AND  TURKEY, PRODUCES DOUBLE-STACK INTERMODAL RAILCARS, TANK CARS, CONVENTIONAL RAILCARS, AUTOMOTIVE RAILCAR PRODUCTS AND MARINE VESSELS. THE WHEELS, REPAIR & PARTS SEGMENT PERFORMS WHEEL AND AXLE SERVICING; RAILCAR REPAIR, REFURBISHMENT AND  MAINTENANCE; AS WELL AS PRODUCTION OF A VARIETY OF PARTS FOR THE RAILROAD INDUSTRY IN NORTH AMERICA. THE LEASING & SERVICES SEGMENT OWNS APPROXIMATELY 8,900 RAILCARS AND PROVIDES MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR APPROXIMATELY 374,000 RAILCARS FOR  RAILROADS, SHIPPERS, CARRIERS, INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND OTHER LEASING AND TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES IN NORTH AMERICA AS OF MAY 31, 2019. THROUGH UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES WE PRODUCE RAILCARS IN BRAZIL, RAIL AND INDUSTRIAL CASTINGS, TANK HEADS  AND OTHER COMPONENTS AND WE HAVE AN OWNERSHIP STAKE IN A LEASE FINANCING WAREHOUSE.  OUR TOTAL MANUFACTURING BACKLOG OF RAILCAR UNITS AS OF MAY 31,  2019 WAS APPROXIMATELY 26,100 UNITS WITH AN ESTIMATED VALUE OF $2.74 BILLION. APPROXIMATELY 1% OF BACKLOG UNITS AND ESTIMATED VALUE AS OF MAY 31, 2019 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BRAZILIAN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS WHICH IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER  THE EQUITY METHOD. BACKLOG UNITS FOR LEASE MAY BE SYNDICATED TO THIRD PARTIES OR HELD IN OUR OWN FLEET DEPENDING ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS. MULTI-YEAR SUPPLY AGREEMENTS ARE A PART OF RAIL INDUSTRY PRACTICE. A PORTION OF THE ORDERS INCLUDED IN BACKLOG  REFLECTS AN ASSUMED PRODUCT MIX. UNDER TERMS OF THE ORDERS, THE EXACT MIX AND PRICING WILL BE DETERMINED IN THE FUTURE, WHICH MAY IMPACT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF BACKLOG. MARINE BACKLOG AS OF MAY 31, 2019 WAS $82 MILLION.  OUR BACKLOG OF RAILCAR UNITS AND MARINE VESSELS IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CERTAIN ORDERS IN BACKLOG ARE SUBJECT TO  CUSTOMARY DOCUMENTATION AND COMPLETION OF TERMS. CUSTOMERS MAY ATTEMPT TO CANCEL OR MODIFY ORDERS IN BACKLOG. HISTORICALLY, LITTLE VARIATION HAS BEEN EXPERIENCED BETWEEN THE QUANTITY ORDERED AND THE QUANTITY ACTUALLY DELIVERED, THOUGH THE TIMING OF  DELIVERIES MAY BE MODIFIED FROM TIME TO TIME. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT OUR REPORTED BACKLOG WILL CONVERT TO REVENUE IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD, IF AT ALL.  ON APRIL 17, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE THE MANUFACTURING BUSINESS OF AMERICAN RAILCAR INDUSTRIES IN A TRANSACTION VALUED AT  $400 MILLION, AFTER ADJUSTMENTS FOR NET TAX BENEFITS VALUED AT $30 MILLION. THE GROSS PURCHASE PRICE TOTALS $430 MILLION AND INCLUDES $30 MILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ON RAILCAR LINING OPERATIONS AND OTHER FACILITY  IMPROVEMENTS.

ADVANCES UNDER THIS FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT LIBOR PLUS 1.50% OR PRIME PLUS 0.50% DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF BORROWING. AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY ARE GENERALLY BASED ON DEFINED LEVELS OF  INVENTORY, RECEIVABLES, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND LEASED EQUIPMENT, AS WELL AS TOTAL DEBT TO CONSOLIDATED CAPITALIZATION AND FIXED CHARGES COVERAGE RATIOS.  AS OF MAY 31, 2019, LINES OF CREDIT TOTALING $42.7 MILLION SECURED BY CERTAIN OF OUR EUROPEAN ASSETS, WITH VARIABLE RATES THAT RANGE FROM WARSAW  INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (WIBOR) PLUS 1.1% TO WIBOR PLUS 1.3% AND EURO INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (EURIBOR) PLUS 1.1%, WERE AVAILABLE FOR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS OF OUR EUROPEAN MANUFACTURING OPERATION. THE EUROPEAN LINES OF CREDIT INCLUDE A  $12.5 MILLION FACILITY WHICH IS GUARANTEED BY US. EUROPEAN CREDIT FACILITIES ARE CONTINUALLY BEING RENEWED. CURRENTLY, THESE EUROPEAN CREDIT FACILITIES HAVE MATURITIES THAT RANGE FROM JULY 2019 THROUGH FEBRUARY 2021.  OUR MEXICAN RAILCAR MANUFACTURING JOINT VENTURE HAS TWO LINES OF CREDIT TOTALING $50.0 MILLION. THE FIRST LINE OF CREDIT PROVIDES UP TO  $30.0 MILLION. ADVANCES UNDER THIS FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT LIBOR PLUS 2.0%. THE MEXICAN RAILCAR MANUFACTURING JOINT VENTURE WILL BE ABLE TO DRAW AGAINST THIS FACILITY THROUGH MARCH 2024. THE SECOND LINE OF CREDIT PROVIDES UP TO  $20.0 MILLION, OF WHICH WE AND OUR JOINT VENTURE PARTNER HAVE EACH GUARANTEED 50%. ADVANCES UNDER THIS FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT LIBOR PLUS 2.0%. THE MEXICAN RAILCAR MANUFACTURING JOINT VENTURE WILL BE ABLE TO DRAW AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER THIS  FACILITY THROUGH JUNE 2021.  AS OF MAY 31, 2019, OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES CONSISTED OF $23.9 MILLION  IN LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THE NORTH AMERICAN CREDIT FACILITY AND $26.0 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER THE EUROPEAN CREDIT FACILITIES.  THE REVOLVING AND  OPERATING LINES OF CREDIT, ALONG WITH NOTES PAYABLE, CONTAIN COVENANTS WITH RESPECT TO US AND OUR VARIOUS SUBSIDIARIES, THE MOST RESTRICTIVE OF WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO: INCUR ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS OR GUARANTEES; PAY  DIVIDENDS OR REPURCHASE STOCK; ENTER INTO CAPITAL LEASES; CREATE LIENS; SELL ASSETS; ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES, INCLUDING JOINT VENTURES AND NON U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOANS, ADVANCES, EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND  GUARANTEES; ENTER INTO MERGERS, CONSOLIDATIONS OR SALES OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OUR ASSETS; AND ENTER INTO NEW LINES OF BUSINESS. THE COVENANTS ALSO REQUIRE CERTAIN MAXIMUM RATIOS OF DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION AND MINIMUM LEVELS OF FIXED CHARGES  (INTEREST PLUS RENT) COVERAGE. AS OF MAY 31, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL SUCH RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS.  45  THE GREENBRIER COMPANIES, INC.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY SEEK TO REPURCHASE OR OTHERWISE RETIRE OR EXCHANGE SECURITIES, INCLUDING  OUTSTANDING NOTES, BORROWINGS AND EQUITY SECURITIES, AND TAKE OTHER STEPS TO REDUCE OUR DEBT OR OTHERWISE IMPROVE OUR BALANCE SHEET. THESE ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE OPEN MARKET REPURCHASES, UNSOLICITED OR SOLICITED PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED  TRANSACTIONS OR OTHER RETIREMENTS, REPURCHASES OR EXCHANGES. SUCH RETIREMENTS, REPURCHASES OR EXCHANGES, IF ANY, WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, TRADING LEVELS OF OUR DEBT,  OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS, IF APPLICABLE. THE AMOUNTS INVOLVED IN ANY SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, BE MATERIAL AND MAY INVOLVE ALL OR A PORTION OF A PARTICULAR SERIES OF NOTES OR OTHER  INDEBTEDNESS WHICH MAY REDUCE THE FLOAT AND IMPACT THE TRADING MARKET OF NOTES OR OTHER INDEBTEDNESS WHICH REMAIN OUTSTANDING.  WE HAVE GLOBAL OPERATIONS  THAT CONDUCT BUSINESS IN THEIR LOCAL CURRENCIES AS WELL AS OTHER CURRENCIES. TO MITIGATE THE EXPOSURE TO TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS WITH  ESTABLISHED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT THE MARGIN ON A PORTION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY SALES IN FIRM BACKLOG. GIVEN THE STRONG CREDIT STANDING OF THE COUNTERPARTIES, NO PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR CREDIT LOSS DUE TO COUNTERPARTY  NON-PERFORMANCE.  AS OF MAY 31, 2019, WE HAD A $10.0 MILLION NOTE RECEIVABLE FROM AMSTED-MAXION CRUZEIRO, OUR  UNCONSOLIDATED BRAZILIAN CASTINGS AND COMPONENTS MANUFACTURER AND A $19.2 MILLION NOTE RECEIVABLE BALANCE FROM GREENBRIER-MAXION, OUR UNCONSOLIDATED BRAZILIAN RAILCAR MANUFACTURER. THESE NOTE RECEIVABLES ARE INCLUDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE  SHEET IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET. IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY MAKE LOANS TO OR PROVIDE GUARANTEES FOR AMSTED-MAXION CRUZEIRO OR GREENBRIER-MAXION.  WE EXPECT  EXISTING FUNDS AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH PROCEEDS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCLUDING BORROWINGS UNDER EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES AND LONG-TERM FINANCINGS, TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ACQUISITION OF THE  MANUFACTURING BUSINESS OF AMERICAN RAILCAR INDUSTRIES, EXPECTED DEBT REPAYMENTS, WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES AND DIVIDENDS DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS.  46  THE GREENBRIER COMPANIES, INC.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. REQUIRES JUDGMENT ON THE PART OF MANAGEMENT TO  ARRIVE AT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. THESE ESTIMATES MAY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITHIN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE PERIODICALLY EVALUATED AND MAY BE ADJUSTED IN FUTURE PERIODS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  INCOME TAXES  -  FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, INCOME TAX EXPENSE IS ESTIMATED BASED ON AMOUNTS ANTICIPATED TO BE REPORTED ON TAX RETURN  FILINGS. THOSE ANTICIPATED AMOUNTS MAY CHANGE FROM WHEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED TO WHEN THE TAX RETURNS ARE FILED. FURTHER, BECAUSE TAX FILINGS ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY TAXING AUTHORITIES, THERE IS RISK THAT A POSITION TAKEN IN  PREPARATION OF A TAX RETURN MAY BE CHALLENGED BY A TAXING AUTHORITY. IF A CHALLENGE IS SUCCESSFUL, DIFFERENCES IN TAX EXPENSE OR BETWEEN CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAX ITEMS MAY ARISE IN FUTURE PERIODS. ANY MATERIAL EFFECT OF SUCH DIFFERENCES WOULD BE  REFLECTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHEN MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE EFFECT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF OCCURRING AND THE AMOUNT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. VALUATION ALLOWANCES REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO AMOUNTS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WILL BE REALIZED  BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE WHEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED. THIS INFORMATION MAY INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE INCOME AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.  WARRANTY ACCRUALS  - WARRANTY COSTS TO COVER A DEFINED WARRANTY PERIOD ARE ESTIMATED AND CHARGED TO OPERATIONS. THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY COST IS  BASED ON HISTORICAL WARRANTY CLAIMS FOR EACH PARTICULAR PRODUCT TYPE. FOR NEW PRODUCT TYPES WITHOUT A WARRANTY HISTORY, PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL INFORMATION FOR SIMILAR PRODUCT TYPES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AS  THEY ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND JUDGMENT FOR NEW PRODUCTS. IF WARRANTY CLAIMS ARE MADE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD FOR ISSUES THAT HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN THE SUBJECT OF WARRANTY CLAIMS AND WERE NOT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION  IN ESTABLISHING THE ACCRUAL OR IF CLAIMS FOR ISSUES ALREADY CONSIDERED IN ESTABLISHING THE ACCRUAL EXCEED EXPECTATIONS, WARRANTY EXPENSE MAY EXCEED THE ACCRUAL FOR THAT PARTICULAR PRODUCT. CONVERSELY, THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT CLAIMS MAY BE  LOWER THAN ESTIMATES. THE WARRANTY ACCRUAL IS PERIODICALLY REVIEWED AND UPDATED BASED ON WARRANTY TRENDS. HOWEVER, AS WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE CLAIMS, THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN ANY ONE REPORTING PERIOD TO BE MATERIAL.  ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS  - AT TIMES WE MAY BE INVOLVED IN VARIOUS PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. WE ESTIMATE FUTURE COSTS FOR KNOWN  ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS AND ACCRUE FOR THEM WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE HAVE INCURRED A LIABILITY AND THE RELATED COSTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION. IF FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN OR RESOLUTION OF  AN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTER RESULT IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DEVELOP THESE RESERVES, THE ACCRUAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COULD BE MATERIALLY UNDERSTATED OR OVERSTATED. ADJUSTMENTS TO  THESE LIABILITIES ARE MADE WHEN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE THAT AFFECTS THE ESTIMATED COSTS TO STUDY OR REMEDIATE ANY ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES OR WHEN EXPENDITURES FOR WHICH RESERVES ARE ESTABLISHED ARE MADE. DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN NATURE OF  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT BECOME INVOLVED IN FUTURE LITIGATION OR OTHER PROCEEDINGS OR, IF WE WERE FOUND TO BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE IN ANY LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING, THAT SUCH COSTS WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO  US.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  - WE MEASURE REVENUE AT THE AMOUNTS THAT REFLECT THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR  TRANSFERRING CONTROL OF GOODS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE EITHER AT THE POINT IN TIME OR OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS TO CUSTOMERS ARE SATISFIED. PAYMENT TERMS VARY BY SEGMENT AND PRODUCT TYPE AND ARE  GENERALLY DUE WITHIN NORMAL COMMERCIAL TERMS. OUR CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS MAY INCLUDE MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS (E.G. RAILCARS, MAINTENANCE, MANAGEMENT SERVICES, ETC.). FOR SUCH ARRANGEMENTS, WE ALLOCATE REVENUES TO EACH PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATION BASED ON ITS RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE. WE HAVE DISAGGREGATED REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS INTO CATEGORIES WHICH DESCRIBE THE PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES FROM WHICH WE GENERATE OUR REVENUES.  47  THE GREENBRIER COMPANIES, INC.  MANUFACTURING  RAILCARS ARE MANUFACTURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 ACCEPTANCE OF THE COMPLETED RAILCARS AT A  SPECIFIED DELIVERY POINT. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO MULTI-YEAR SUPPLY AGREEMENTS. EACH RAILCAR DELIVERY IS CONSIDERED A DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, SUCH THAT THE AMOUNTS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE FOLLOWING RAILCAR DELIVERY ARE  GENERALLY NOT SUBJECT TO CHANGE.  WE TYPICALLY RECOGNIZE MARINE VESSEL MANUFACTURING REVENUE OVER TIME USING THE COST INPUT METHOD, BASED ON PROGRESS  TOWARD CONTRACT COMPLETION MEASURED BY ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED TO DATE IN RELATION TO THE ESTIMATE OF TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS. THIS METHOD BEST DEPICTS OUR PERFORMANCE IN COMPLETING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE MARINE VESSEL FOR THE CUSTOMER AND IS CONSISTENT  WITH THE PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION METHOD USED PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW REVENUE STANDARD.  WHEELS, REPAIR & PARTS  WE OPERATE A NETWORK OF WHEEL, REPAIR AND PARTS SHOPS IN NORTH AMERICA THAT PROVIDE COMPLETE WHEELSET RECONDITIONING AND RAILCAR REPAIR SERVICES.  WHEELS REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN WHEELSETS ARE SHIPPED TO THE CUSTOMER OR WHEN CONSUMED BY CUSTOMERS IN THE CASE OF CONSIGNMENT ARRANGEMENTS. PARTS REVENUE  IS RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT OF THE PARTS TO THE CUSTOMERS.  REPAIR REVENUE IS TYPICALLY RECOGNIZED OVER TIME USING THE COST INPUT METHOD, BASED ON  PROGRESS TOWARD CONTRACT COMPLETION MEASURED BY ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED TO DATE IN RELATION TO THE ESTIMATE OF TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS. THIS METHOD BEST DEPICTS OUR PERFORMANCE IN REPAIRING THE RAILCARS FOR THE CUSTOMER. REPAIR SERVICES ARE TYPICALLY  COMPLETED IN LESS THAN 90 DAYS.  LEASING & SERVICES  WE OWN A FLEET OF NEW AND USED CARS WHICH ARE LEASED TO THIRD-PARTY CUSTOMERS. LEASE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE LEASE-TERM IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT IS  EARNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 840.  LEASES.  SYNDICATION TRANSACTIONS REPRESENT NEW AND USED RAILCARS WHICH HAVE BEEN PLACED ON LEASE TO A CUSTOMER  AND WHICH WE INTEND TO SELL TO AN INVESTOR WITH THE LEASE ATTACHED. AT THE TIME OF SUCH SALE, REVENUE AND COST OF REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH RAILCARS THAT WE HAVE MANUFACTURED ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE MANUFACTURING SEGMENT; WHILE REVENUE AND COST OF  REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH RAILCARS WHICH WERE OBTAINED FROM A THIRD-PARTY WITH THE INTENT TO RESELL THEM AND SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD, ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE LEASING & SERVICES SEGMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 840.  LEASES.  WE ENTER INTO MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS FOR WHICH REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE  BASIS OVER THE CONTRACT TERM AS A STAND-READY OBLIGATION. COSTS TO FULFILL THESE CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS INCURRED.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED  ASSETS  - WHEN CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, THE ASSETS ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FORECAST OF UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT  OF THE ASSETS, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS TO FAIR VALUE WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF THE IMPAIRMENT AND COULD BE MATERIALLY  DIFFERENT IF CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE. IF THE FORECAST OF UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXCEEDS THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSETS IT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE ASSETS WERE NOT IMPAIRED.  GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS  - WE PERIODICALLY ACQUIRE BUSINESSES IN PURCHASE TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THE ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE MAY  RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE VALUE OF SUCH INTANGIBLE ASSETS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE PERIOD AMORTIZATION AND  POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.  48  THE GREENBRIER COMPANIES, INC.  GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY DURING THE THIRD QUARTER.  THE PROVISIONS OF ASC 350.  INTANGIBLES \u2013 GOODWILL AND OTHER,  REQUIRE THAT WE PERFORM THIS TEST BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE. WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS BASED ON A  WEIGHTING OF INCOME AND MARKET APPROACHES. UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH, WE CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS WHICH INCORPORATES EXPECTED REVENUE AND MARGINS AND THE USE OF DISCOUNT  RATES. UNDER THE MARKET APPROACH, WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE BASED ON OBSERVED MARKET MULTIPLES FOR COMPARABLE BUSINESSES. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S  FAIR VALUE. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS CANNOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THE REPORTING UNIT. GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE ALSO TESTED MORE FREQUENTLY IF CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE OCCURRENCE OF EVENTS  INDICATES THAT A POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. WHEN CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS A DECLINE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, CHANGES IN DEMAND OR IN THE NUMEROUS VARIABLES ASSOCIATED WITH THE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES MADE IN  ASSESSING THE APPROPRIATE VALUATION OF GOODWILL INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF CERTAIN INDEFINITE LIVED ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, THE ASSETS ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT. IF ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS WERE TO DIFFER FROM THESE ASSUMPTIONS, IT  MAY RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL.  BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST, A  NON-CASH  IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $10.0 MILLION WAS RECORDED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 RELATED TO OUR REPAIR REPORTING UNIT. AFTER THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, OUR REMAINING GOODWILL BALANCE WAS $74.3 MILLION AS OF MAY 31, 2019 OF  WHICH $43.3 MILLION RELATED TO OUR WHEELS, REPAIR & PARTS SEGMENT AND $31.0 MILLION RELATED TO OUR MANUFACTURING SEGMENT.  49  THE GREENBRIER COMPANIES, INC.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "GREENBRIER COMPANIES INC", "CIK": 923120, "Date": "2019-07-02T00:00:00", "Ticker": "GBX", "Name": "Greenbrier Companies Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 3743.0, "Business": "OR", "Incorporated": "OR", "IRS": 930816972.0, "key": "20190702GBX", "labelr1": -1.5673981191222546, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": 2.3000707714083455, "labelr4": 1.106883431338638, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.23112099, "prof1": 0.768879, "return1&2": 0.9843260188087776, "return1&2&3": 1.0069662138627655, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0181121560431905, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 0.9843260188087776, "return3": 1.0230007077140837, "return4": 1.0110688343133865, "1_day_return": -1.567398119122254, "cumulative_return1": 0.4149826407822269, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.1620384591208979, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.009104006156665607, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.004859721813161546, "indexx": 1321, "cumreturn1b": 0.9932549747907572, "cumreturndow": 1.007672378472752, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0066943837044624}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1324, "level_0": 2971, "index": 88256, "text": "ITEM 2.

THE EMPLOYEE TURNOVER RATE IN THIS BUSINESS AND THE RISK OF LOSING EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES IS HIGH. HIGHER TURNOVER RATES CAN INCREASE COSTS AND DECREASE OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND PRODUCTIVITY.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS SINCE 1980 AND ARE HEADQUARTERED IN FREMONT, CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA, ASIA-PACIFIC AND EUROPE. WE WERE ORIGINALLY INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS COMPAC MICROELECTRONICS, INC  . IN NOVEMBER 1980, AND WE CHANGED OUR NAME TO SYNNEX INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, INC. IN FEBRUARY 1994. WE LATER REINCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE UNDER THE NAME OF SYNNEX CORPORATION IN OCTOBER 2003. AS OF  MAY 31, 2019  , WE HAD  OVER 23  1  ,000  FULL  -TIME  AND TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES WORLDWIDE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  ON DECEMBER 1, 2018, WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 606 APPLYING THE FULL RETROSPECTIVE METHOD.

EXCEPT FOR THE ABOVE, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, WE ADOPTED CERTAIN OTHER NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION OF THESE PRONOUNCEMENTS WAS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  ACQUISITIONS  WE CONTINUALLY SEEK TO AUGMENT ORGANIC GROWTH IN BOTH OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS WITH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS THAT COMPLEMENT AND EXPAND OUR EXISTING CAPABILITIES. WE ALSO DIVEST BUSINESSES THAT WE DEEM NO LONGER STRATEGIC TO OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS. IN OUR TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS WE SEEK TO ACQUIRE NEW OEM RELATIONSHIPS, ENHANCE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES, THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND OEM SUPPLIERS, AND EXPAND OUR GEOGRAPHIC FOOTPRINT. IN OUR CONCENTRIX SEGMENT, WE SEEK TO FURTHER ENHANCE OUR CAPABILITIES AND DOMAIN EXPERTISE IN OUR KEY VERTICALS, EXPAND OUR GEOGRAPHIC FOOTPRINT AND FURTHER EXPAND INTO HIGHER VALUE SERVICE OFFERINGS. WE ARE ALSO STRATEGICALLY FOCUSED ON FURTHER INCREASING OUR SCALE TO SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS.  CONVERGYS ACQUISITION  ON OCTOBER 5, 2018, WE ACQUIRED 100% OF CONVERGYS CORPORATION, A CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE OUTSOURCING COMPANY, FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $2.3 BILLION.

WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS USEFUL TO THE READER TO BETTER ASSESS AND UNDERSTAND OUR BASE OPERATING PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARING RESULTS WITH PREVIOUS PERIODS AND FOR PLANNING AND FORECASTING IN FUTURE PERIODS, PRIMARILY BECAUSE MANAGEMENT TYPICALLY MONITORS THE BUSINESS ADJUSTED FOR THESE ITEMS IN ADDITION TO GAAP RESULTS. MANAGEMENT ALSO USES THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES TO ESTABLISH OPERATIONAL GOALS AND, IN SOME CASES, FOR MEASURING PERFORMANCE FOR COMPENSATION PURPOSES. AS THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THEY MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES EMPLOYED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

CONCENTRIX WORKING CAPITAL IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. OUR CASH CONVERSION  CYCLE WAS 53 DAYS  AND 41 DAYS AS OF MAY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE CONVERGYS ACQUISITION AND THE RESULTANT LARGER CONTRIBUTION OF CONCENTRIX TO OUR OVERALL BUSINESS, HIGHER PROPORTION OF REVENUE RECORDED ON A NET BASIS UNDER PRINCIPAL VERSUS AGENT REVENUE GUIDANCE, AND TIMING OF COLLECTIONS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PAYMENTS OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  TO INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE AND BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MAY FURTHER EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH INVESTMENTS OR ACQUISITIONS. WE EXPECT THAT SUCH EXPANSION WOULD REQUIRE AN INITIAL INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL, PERSONNEL, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS. THESE INVESTMENTS OR ACQUISITIONS WOULD LIKELY BE FUNDED PRIMARILY BY OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS, OR THE ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $47.4 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $290.3 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN INVENTORIES OF $214.3 MILLION, AND A NET CHANGE IN OTHER OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $112.6 MILLION. THESE CASH OUTFLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET INCOME OF $201.6 MILLION, ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS OF $190.3 MILLION, AND A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $176.4 MILLION. TYPICALLY, REVENUE IN BOTH OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE ARE HIGHEST IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER AND LOWER IN INTERIM PERIODS WHICH RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. THE INCREASE IN INVENTORIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO BUSINESS GROWTH IN OUR SYSTEMS DESIGN AND INTEGRATION BUSINESS WHERE WE CARRY HIGHER LEVELS OF INVENTORIES. THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, A $19.0 MILLION GAIN RECORDED UPON THE SETTLEMENT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO OUR WESTCON-COMSTOR AMERICAS ACQUISITION IN FISCAL YEAR 2017, AND DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $62.7  MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET INCOME OF $117.8 MILLION, A DECREASE IN  ACCOUNTS AND VENDOR RECEIVABLES OF $103.1 MILLION, ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS OF $82.2 MILLION, A NET CHANGE IN OTHER OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $61.7 MILLION AND A DECREASE IN INVENTORIES OF $39.9 MILLION. THESE CASH INFLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $342.1 MILLION.  TYPICALLY, REVENUE IN BOTH OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE ARE HIGHEST IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER AND LOWER IN INTERIM PERIODS WHICH RESULTS IN AN INCREASE IN CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS.  THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND THE DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO THE NEW U.S. TAX RATE DUE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET  CASH  USED IN  INVESTING  ACTIVITIES DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  WAS  $65.9  MILLION,  PRIMARILY DUE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  OF  $60.4  MILLION  RELATED  TO INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT GROWTH IN BOTH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS  AND $6.2 MILLION OF CASH PAID RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS ASSUMED UNDER THE CONVER  GYS ACQUISITION.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018 WAS $50.5 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $50.0 MILLION, RELATED SUBSTANTIALLY TO OUR  CONCENTRIX SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, WE MADE A FINAL PAYMENT OF $8.2 MILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF TIGERSPIKE AND RECEIVED A REFUND OF $2.3 MILLION FROM THE SELLERS TOWARDS THE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN PRE-ACQUISITION INTRA GROUP TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF WESTCON-COMSTOR AMERICAS IN FISCAL YEAR 2017.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WAS $69.8 MILLION  PRIMARILY DUE TO A RETURN OF CASH TO STOCKHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF $38.4 MILLION OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND  $14.3 MILLION OF REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON  STOCK. IN ADDITION, NET REPAYMENTS UNDER OUR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS WERE $17.7 MILLION. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY DREW THE LAST TRANCHE OF $250.0 MILLION UNDER A TERM LOAN FACILITY OBTAINED IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR THE CONVERGYS ACQUISITION FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THE REMAINING AMOUNT OF CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES ASSUMED AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION AND THE REMAINDER WAS USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018 WAS $206.2 MILLION, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF $128.3 MILLION OF NET REPAYMENTS UNDER OUR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS BY UTILIZING THE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS DURING THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER OF 2017 AND A RETURN OF CASH TO STOCKHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF $46.0 MILLION OF REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND $27.9 MILLION OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR CASH AND CASH  EQUIVALENTS TOTALED $271.5 MILLION AND $454.7 MILLION AS OF MAY 31, 2019  AND NOVEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OF OUR TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, THE CASH HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WAS $204.1 MILLION AND $301.1 MILLION AS OF MAY 31, 2019 AND NOVEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL TAX ON REPATRIATION INTO THE UNITED STATES. REPATRIATION OF SOME FOREIGN BALANCES IS RESTRICTED BY LOCAL LAWS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE FULLY UTILIZED AND REINVESTED ALL FOREIGN CASH TO FUND OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND EXPANSION. IF IN THE FUTURE OUR INTENTIONS CHANGE, AND WE REPATRIATE THE CASH BACK TO THE UNITED STATES, WE WILL REPORT IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE IMPACT OF STATE AND WITHHOLDING TAXES DEPENDING UPON THE PLANNED TIMING AND MANNER OF SUCH REPATRIATION. PRESENTLY, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES, CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY WITHIN THE UNITED STATES TO FUND CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE WORKING CAPITAL, INVESTMENT AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCES, THE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND OUR EXISTING SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR CURRENT AND PLANNED WORKING CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT NEEDS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS IN ALL GEOGRAPHIES, INCLUDING FOR OPERATIONS OF THE ACQUIRED CONVERGYS BUSINESS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT OUR LONGER-TERM WORKING CAPITAL, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ANTICIPATED STOCK REPURCHASES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS WILL BE SATISFIED THROUGH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND, TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY, FROM OUR BORROWING FACILITIES AND FUTURE FINANCIAL MARKET ACTIVITIES.  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE RENEWED OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION PROGRAM AND OUR U.S. CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT DESCRIBED BELOW ON, OR PRIOR TO, THEIR RESPECTIVE EXPIRATION DATES. WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THESE AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS WILL NOT BE RENEWED AS WE  CONTINUE TO BE IN GOOD CREDIT STANDING WITH THE PARTICIPATING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WE HAVE HAD SIMILAR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT OUR YEARS AS A PUBLIC COMPANY.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  WE HAVE TWO DISTINCT OPERATING SEGMENTS, THE ENERGY SEGMENT AND THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT, AS DEFINED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  . MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE MOST MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS TO ANALYZE OUR PERFORMANCE BY SEGMENT. WE USE REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT TO EVALUATE OUR SEGMENTS. SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME CONSISTS OF NET SALES LESS COST OF SALES AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIABLE TO A SEGMENT. FOR A RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME TO CONSOLIDATED  OPERATING INCOME, SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR QUARTERLY CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.

OUR BACKLOG DECREASED  $4.8 MILLION  , OR  1.6%  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , OUR INCOMING NET ORDERS DECREASED BY  $39.4 MILLION  , OR  13.3%  WHEN COMPARED TO SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL  2019  AND OUR BOOK-TO-REVENUE RATIO DECREASED TO  0.89  TO 1 FROM  1.13  TO 1. THESE DECREASES WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SOFTNESS IN NET BOOKINGS DUE TO LOWER OVERALL INTERNATIONAL PROJECT BOOKINGS. THE DECREASES IN BACKLOG WERE ALSO DUE TO HIGHER OVERALL REVENUES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  RELATED PRIMARILY TO CERTAIN LARGE INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS THAT WERE BOOKED IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND COMMENCED REVENUE RECOGNITION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 UPON SATISFYING THE REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA.  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE TABLE BELOW INCLUDES THE PROGRESSION OF BACKLOG (IN THOUSANDS).

THIS  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A GENERAL UPTICK IN THE SALES OF OUR ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS, THE SATISFACTION OF THE REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA FOR CERTAIN LARGE INTERNATIONAL ELECTRICAL PROJECTS THAT WERE BOOKED IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND THE WESTINGHOUSE SETTLEMENT NOTED FURTHER BELOW. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN REVENUES FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS, WHICH WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER INTERNATIONAL REVENUES RESULTING FROM A LARGE REFINING PROJECT RECORDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD.  REVENUES FOR THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT  INCREASED  $6.9 MILLION  OR  6.0%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL  2019  . THIS  INCREASE  WAS THE RESULT OF SLIGHTLY HIGHER SELLING PRICES AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER VOLUMES OF STEEL PROCESSED DUE PRIMARILY TO OUR ACQUISITION OF TENNESSEE GALVANIZING, INC. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. IN ADDITION, THE INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED VOLUMES FROM THE SOLAR AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKETS AND INCREMENTAL REVENUES FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF K2 PARTNERS, INC., ALSO DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR RECENT ACQUISITIONS IN THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OPERATING MARGINS WERE  7.5%  AND  6.8%  , FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THESE  INCREASES  WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE POSITIVE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PROJECT MARGINS FOR OUR ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUES FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT  INCREASED  BY  $4.2 MILLION  OR  16.7%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL  2019  . IN ADDITION, OPERATING MARGINS IMPROVED TO  24.1%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  21.9%  , FOR THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. THESE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASED VOLUMES AND SELLING PRICES NOTED ABOVE AND A DECLINE IN ZINC COSTS.  CORPORATE EXPENSES  CORPORATE EXPENSES  DECREASED  BY  $0.5 MILLION  OR  4.4%  , FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SLIGHTLY LOWER SPENDING FOR OUTSIDE SERVICES.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  WAS  $3.6 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $3.8 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER AVERAGE OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES AND WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON VARIABLE RATE DEBT. OUR GROSS DEBT TO EQUITY RATIO WAS  0.48  TO 1 AS OF  MAY 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  0.56  TO 1 AS OF  MAY 31, 2018.  INCOME TAXES  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES REFLECTS AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  21.1%  AND  22.0%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO STATE TAX BENEFITS.  WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY BANKRUPTCY CASE  WE HAD EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH SUBSIDIARIES OF WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY (\u201cWEC\u201d). WEC AND THE RELEVANT SUBSIDIARIES (THE \"DEBTORS\") FILED RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE ON MARCH 29, 2017 IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, JOINTLY ADMINISTERED AS IN RE WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY, ET AL., CASE NO. 17-10751 (THE \"BANKRUPTCY CASE\"). THE COMPANY HAS BEEN COLLECTING ON POST-PETITION AMOUNTS DUE AND OWED. ON FEBRUARY 22, 2018, THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK APPROVED THE DEBTORS\u2019 MODIFIED FIRST AMENDED DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FOR THE JOINT CHAPTER 11 PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. IN THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, THE DEBTORS ESTIMATED A 98.9% TO 100% DISTRIBUTION ON ALLOWED GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS. WE FILED APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION OF SUCH CLAIMS WITH THE COURT, WHICH INCLUDES 100% OF OUR PRE-PETITION CLAIMS. IN APRIL 2019, FOR ONE OF OUR PLANTS, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE THIRD PARTY BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATOR RELATED TO OUTSTANDING CLAIMS. THE AGREEMENT AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $8.1 MILLION REPRESENTED 100% OF THOSE OUTSTANDING CLAIMS FOR SUCH PLANT. THE IMPACT OF THE SETTLEMENT NOTED ABOVE HAD NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON OPERATING INCOME FOR THE PERIOD. INCLUDING THE ABOVE NOTED SETTLEMENT AND APPROXIMATELY $2.1 MILLION OF ADJUSTMENTS TO THE INITIAL CLAIM AMOUNTS, $1.8 MILLION OF CLAIMS REMAIN OUTSTANDING, OF WHICH $0.6 MILLION HAS BEEN RESERVED.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY MET OUR CASH NEEDS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ALONG WITH BANK AND BOND MARKET DEBT. OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS ARE GENERALLY FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES, CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, DEBT REPAYMENT, ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH POSITION, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR EXPECTATION OF CONTINUING AVAILABILITY TO DRAW UPON OUR CREDIT FACILITIES ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CASH FLOW NEEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  CASH FLOWS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOWS BY CATEGORY FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED (IN THOUSANDS).  THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31,  2019  2018  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(18,587  )  $(12,366  )  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (43,469  )  (10,847  )  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  51,560  16,796  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $18.6 MILLION  , NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $43.5 MILLION  , NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $51.6 MILLION  , AND A DECREASE OF  $0.1 MILLION  FROM THE NET EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH RESULTING IN A NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $10.4 MILLION  . IN COMPARISON TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN FISCAL  2019  , THE RESULTS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , ARE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LESS FAVORABLE IMPACTS OF CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL THAT WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME. THE COMPANY'S USE OF CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS HIGHER DUE TO INCREASED SPENDING ON ACQUISITIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS HIGHER DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED NET BORROWINGS.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL WAS  $258.2 MILLION  AS OF  MAY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO  $213.8 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  FINANCING AND CAPITAL  AS OF  MAY 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD  $297.0 MILLION  OF FLOATING AND FIXED RATE NOTES OUTSTANDING WITH VARYING MATURITIES THROUGH FISCAL 2023 AND THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE COVENANTS RELATED TO THESE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS.

REPURCHASES UNDER THIS SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION WOULD BE MADE THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, INCLUDING RULE 10B-18 UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT. THE COMPANY DID NOT MAKE ANY REPURCHASES OF ITS COMMON SHARES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019.  OTHER EXPOSURES  WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY PRICE INCREASES IN BOTH SEGMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS, PRIMARILY COPPER, ALUMINUM, STEEL AND NICKEL BASED ALLOYS IN THE ENERGY SEGMENT AND ZINC AND NATURAL GAS IN THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT. WE ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE THESE INCREASES THROUGH ESCALATION CLAUSES IN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS FOR COPPER, ALUMINUM, STEEL AND NICKEL BASED ALLOYS, WHEN MARKET CONDITIONS ALLOW AND THROUGH FIXED COST CONTRACT PURCHASES ON ZINC. IN ADDITION TO THESE MEASURES, WE ATTEMPT TO RECOVER OTHER COST INCREASES THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, AND THROUGH INCREASES IN PRICES WHERE COMPETITIVELY FEASIBLE.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  AS OF  MAY 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS DEFINED UNDER SEC RULES.

IN A REFERENDUM HELD ON MAY 19, 2019, SWITZERLAND PASSED  TRAF  , EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020. THE TRAF DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE  12 AND 24 WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  . ENACTMENT OF TRAF PROVISIONS SUBSEQUENT TO OUR SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN FUTURE PERIODS.

INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE MADE. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE.  IN THE  12  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA REFLECT THE MONTHS OF  MARCH, APRIL AND MAY  . IN THE  24  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA REFLECT THE MONTHS OF  JANUARY THROUGH MAY  . IN THE  24 WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES GENERATED  40%  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE, WITH MEXICO, RUSSIA, CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND CHINA COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY  19%  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE. AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD. IN EACH OF THE  12 AND 24 WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE REDUCED NET REVENUE GROWTH BY  3  PERCENTAGE POINTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN THE RUSSIAN RUBLE, TURKISH LIRA, EURO, ARGENTINE PESO AND BRAZILIAN REAL. CURRENCY DECLINES AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR WHICH ARE NOT OFFSET COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.  IN ADDITION, VOLATILE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND CIVIL UNREST IN CERTAIN MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD, INCLUDING IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, MEXICO, THE MIDDLE EAST, RUSSIA AND TURKEY, AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IN CERTAIN OF THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, CONTINUE TO, AND THE THREAT OR IMPOSITION OF TARIFFS IN OR RELATED TO THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS MAY, RESULT IN CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO THE UNITED KINGDOM\u2019S PENDING WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, INCLUDING HOW THE UNITED KINGDOM WILL INTERACT WITH OTHER EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES FOLLOWING ITS DEPARTURE, AS WELL AS THE ECONOMIC, OPERATING AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN RUSSIA AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT FOR THE ESSA SEGMENT AND OUR OTHER BUSINESSES.  CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD HAVE EITHER IMPOSED, OR ARE CONSIDERING IMPOSING, NEW OR INCREASED TAXES OR REGULATIONS ON THE MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION OR SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING, INGREDIENTS OR SUBSTANCES CONTAINED IN, OR ATTRIBUTES OF, OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING, COMMODITIES USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING OR THE RECYCLABILITY OR RECOVERABILITY OF OUR PACKAGING. THESE TAXES AND REGULATIONS VARY IN SCOPE AND FORM. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME TAXES APPLY TO ALL BEVERAGES, INCLUDING NON-CALORIC BEVERAGES, WHILE OTHERS APPLY ONLY TO BEVERAGES WITH A CALORIC SWEETENER (E.G., SUGAR). IN ADDITION, SOME REGULATIONS APPLY TO ALL PRODUCTS USING CERTAIN TYPES OF PACKAGING (E.G., PLASTIC), WHILE OTHERS ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF PACKAGING AND ENCOURAGE WASTE REDUCTION AND INCREASED RECYCLING RATES.  WE SELL A WIDE VARIETY OF BEVERAGES, FOODS AND SNACKS IN MORE THAN  200  COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES AND THE PROFILE OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL, THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH PRODUCTS AND THE TYPE OF PACKAGING USED VARIES BY JURISDICTION. BECAUSE OF THIS, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE SCOPE OR FORM POTENTIAL TAXES, REGULATIONS OR OTHER LIMITATIONS ON OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING MAY TAKE, AND THEREFORE CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT OF SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS OR LIMITATIONS ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, TAXES, REGULATIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY IMPACT US AND OUR COMPETITORS DIFFERENTLY. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR EXISTING AND PROPOSED TAXES AND REGULATIONS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED AND SOLD AND TO CONSIDER ACTIONS WE MAY TAKE TO POTENTIALLY MITIGATE THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OR LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING ADVOCATING ALTERNATIVE MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPOSITION, FORM AND SCOPE OF ANY SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS OR LIMITATIONS.  ADDITIONALLY, OUR INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO BE AFFECTED BY DISRUPTION OF THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE, INCLUDING THE RAPID GROWTH IN SALES THROUGH E-COMMERCE WEBSITES AND MOBILE COMMERCE APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, THE INTEGRATION OF PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL OPERATIONS AMONG RETAILERS AND THE INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION OF HARD DISCOUNTERS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR CHANGES IN THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE AND TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS WE MAY TAKE TO BUILD OUR GLOBAL E-COMMERCE CAPABILITIES, DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS EFFECTIVELY THROUGH ALL EXISTING AND EMERGING CHANNELS OF TRADE AND POTENTIALLY MITIGATE ANY UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS ON OUR FUTURE RESULTS.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, THE TCJ ACT WAS ENACTED IN THE UNITED STATES.  WHILE OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE RECORDED IMPACT OF THE  TCJ ACT  AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018 WAS DEEMED TO BE COMPLETE  , THIS AMOUNT WAS BASED ON PREVAILING REGULATIONS AND AVAILABLE INFORMATION AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018, AND ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE  IRS  IMPACTED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO IMPACT, OUR RECORDED AMOUNTS AFTER DECEMBER 29, 2018.

IN A REFERENDUM HELD ON MAY 19, 2019, SWITZERLAND PASSED  TRAF  , EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020. THE TRAF DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE  12 AND 24 WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  . ENACTMENT OF TRAF PROVISIONS SUBSEQUENT TO OUR SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN FUTURE PERIODS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ASSESS THE IMPACT THE TRAF MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.  SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  SEE NOTE 9 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-Q FOR THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS OF  JUNE 15, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 29, 2018  AND NOTE 9 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  2018  FORM 10-K FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE ITEMS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 OUR BUSINESS RISKS\u201d IN OUR  2018  FORM 10-K SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN EVALUATING OUR TRENDS AND FUTURE RESULTS.

OUR DIVISIONS\u2019 PHYSICAL VOLUME MEASURES ARE CONVERTED INTO SERVINGS BASED ON U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION GUIDELINES FOR SINGLE-SERVING SIZES OF OUR PRODUCTS. FOR THE  12 AND 24 WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  , TOTAL SERVINGS INCREASED 3% AND 3.5%, RESPECTIVELY.  WE DISCUSS VOLUME FOR OUR BEVERAGE BUSINESSES ON A BOTTLER CASE SALES (BCS) BASIS IN WHICH ALL BEVERAGE VOLUME IS CONVERTED TO AN 8-OUNCE-CASE METRIC. MOST OF OUR BEVERAGE VOLUME IS SOLD BY OUR COMPANY-OWNED AND FRANCHISE-OWNED BOTTLERS, AND THAT PORTION IS BASED ON OUR BOTTLERS\u2019 SALES TO RETAILERS AND INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS. THE REMAINDER OF OUR VOLUME IS BASED ON OUR DIRECT SHIPMENTS TO RETAILERS AND INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS. WE REPORT SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INTERNATIONAL BEVERAGE VOLUME ON A MONTHLY CALENDAR BASIS. THE  12  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  INCLUDE BEVERAGE VOLUME OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA FOR THE MONTHS OF  MARCH, APRIL AND MAY  . THE  24  WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 15, 2019  INCLUDE BEVERAGE VOLUME OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR THE MONTHS OF  JANUARY THROUGH MAY  .

NET INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED  $13 MILLION  , REFLECTING LOWER INTEREST INCOME DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE CASH BALANCES, AS WELL AS LOWER GAINS ON THE MARKET VALUE OF INVESTMENTS USED TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR DEFERRED COMPENSATION LIABILITY. THESE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES.  THE REPORTED TAX RATE DECREASED  16.5  PERCENTAGE POINTS, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE PRIOR-YEAR PROVISIONAL NET TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE TCJ ACT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PRIOR-YEAR FAVORABLE RESOLUTION WITH THE IRS OF ALL OPEN MATTERS RELATED TO THE AUDITS OF TAXABLE YEARS 2012 AND 2013.

NON-GAAP MEASURES  CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-Q ADJUST FOR THE IMPACT OF SPECIFIED ITEMS AND ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP). WE USE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES INTERNALLY TO MAKE OPERATING AND STRATEGIC DECISIONS, INCLUDING THE PREPARATION OF OUR ANNUAL OPERATING PLAN, EVALUATION OF OUR OVERALL BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND AS A FACTOR IN DETERMINING COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. WE BELIEVE PRESENTING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THIS FORM 10-Q PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO FACILITATE COMPARISON OF OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS AND TRENDS IN OUR UNDERLYING OPERATING RESULTS, AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY ON HOW WE EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS. WE ALSO BELIEVE PRESENTING THESE MEASURES IN THIS FORM 10-Q ALLOWS INVESTORS TO VIEW OUR PERFORMANCE USING THE SAME MEASURES THAT WE USE IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS.  WE CONSIDER QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS IN ASSESSING WHETHER TO ADJUST FOR THE IMPACT OF ITEMS THAT MAY BE SIGNIFICANT OR THAT COULD AFFECT AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR ONGOING FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OR TRENDS. EXAMPLES OF ITEMS FOR WHICH WE MAY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE.  AMOUNTS RELATED TO MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS OR LOSSES (NON-CASH); CHARGES RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS; CHARGES OR ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE ENACTMENT OF NEW LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS, SUCH AS SIGNIFICANT TAX LAW CHANGES; AMOUNTS RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF TAX POSITIONS; TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO REORGANIZATIONS OF OUR OPERATIONS; AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND OTHER STRUCTURAL CHANGES; DEBT REDEMPTIONS, CASH TENDER OR EXCHANGE OFFERS; PENSION AND RETIREE MEDICAL RELATED ITEMS; ASSET IMPAIRMENTS (NON-CASH); AND REMEASUREMENTS OF NET MONETARY ASSETS.  SEE BELOW AND \u201cITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY\u201d FOR A DESCRIPTION OF ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  NON-GAAP INFORMATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPLEMENTAL IN NATURE AND IS NOT MEANT TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. IN ADDITION, OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY NOT BE THE SAME AS OR COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR NON-GAAP MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  THE FOLLOWING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-Q.  \u2022  COST OF SALES,  GROSS PROFIT, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, OTHER PENSION AND RETIREE MEDICAL BENEFITS INCOME, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, EACH ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY  ;  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  OPERATING PROFIT, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PEPSICO PER COMMON SHARE \u2013 DILUTED, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND THE CORRESPONDING CONSTANT CURRENCY GROWTH RATES  ;  \u2022  ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH; AND  \u2022  FREE CASH FLOW.  COST OF SALES,  GROSS PROFIT, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, OTHER PENSION AND RETIREE MEDICAL BENEFITS INCOME, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, EACH ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY  ,  OPERATING PROFIT, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PEPSICO PER COMMON SHARE \u2013 DILUTED, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND THE CORRESPONDING CONSTANT CURRENCY GROWTH RATES  THESE MEASURES EXCLUDE THE NET IMPACT OF MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON CENTRALLY MANAGED COMMODITY DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO OUR 2019 AND 2014 PRODUCTIVITY PLANS, INVENTORY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND MERGER AND INTEGRATION CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF SODASTREAM, TAX BENEFITS/NET TAX EXPENSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE TCJ ACT AND A TAX BENEFIT (SEE \u201cITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY\u201d FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF THESE ITEMS). WE ALSO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE ON OPERATING PROFIT, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PEPSICO PER COMMON SHARE  \u2013  DILUTED, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, WHICH MEASURE OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ASSUMING CONSTANT FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES USED FOR TRANSLATION BASED ON THE RATES IN EFFECT FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. IN ORDER TO COMPUTE OUR CONSTANT CURRENCY RESULTS, WE MULTIPLY OR DIVIDE, AS APPROPRIATE, OUR CURRENT-YEAR U.S. DOLLAR RESULTS BY THE CURRENT-YEAR AVERAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND THEN MULTIPLY OR DIVIDE, AS APPROPRIATE, THOSE AMOUNTS BY THE PRIOR-YEAR AVERAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. WE BELIEVE THESE MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION IN EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY EXCLUDE ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING PERFORMANCE.  ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH  WE DEFINE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AS NET REVENUE GROWTH ADJUSTED FOR THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT FROM ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND OTHER STRUCTURAL CHANGES. WE BELIEVE ORGANIC REVENUE PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION IN EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF ONGOING PERFORMANCE OR THAT WE BELIEVE IMPACT COMPARABILITY WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.  SEE \u201cNET REVENUE AND ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH\u201d IN \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \u2013  DIVISION REVIEW\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  FREE CASH FLOW  WE DEFINE FREE CASH FLOW AS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS CAPITAL SPENDING, PLUS SALES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. SINCE NET CAPITAL SPENDING IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR PRODUCT INNOVATION INITIATIVES AND MAINTAINING OUR OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS A RECURRING AND NECESSARY USE OF CASH. AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE INVESTORS SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER NET CAPITAL SPENDING WHEN EVALUATING OUR CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE 13 WEEKS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018, SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY FORM 10-Q IN ITEM 1 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 2, 2019, AND FOR THE FISCAL YEAR THEN ENDED, THE RELATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ALL CONTAINED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K OF PIER 1 IMPORTS, INC. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 2, 2019.  MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW  PIER 1 IMPORTS, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d) DIRECTLY IMPORTS MERCHANDISE FROM MANY COUNTRIES, AND SELLS A WIDE VARIETY OF DECORATIVE ACCESSORIES, FURNITURE, CANDLES, HOUSEWARES, GIFTS AND SEASONAL PRODUCTS IN RETAIL STORES THROUGHOUT THE U.S. AND CANADA AND ONLINE AT PIER1.COM. THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS AS ONE OPERATING SEGMENT. AS OF JUNE 1, 2019, THE COMPANY OPERATED 967 STORES IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019 AND JUNE 2, 2018, ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR THE FISCAL YEAR BECAUSE OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SEASONALITY FACTORS IN THE RETAIL BUSINESS. HISTORICALLY, THE STRONGEST SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON BEGINNING IN NOVEMBER AND CONTINUING THROUGH DECEMBER.  ON APRIL 17, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS IMPLEMENTING AN ACTION PLAN DESIGNED TO RESET ITS GROSS MARGIN AND COST STRUCTURE, INCLUDING REINVESTING IN THE BUSINESS TO RESET ITS ASSORTMENT STRATEGY, BUILD CORE COMPETENCIES AND TALENT, AND DRIVE LONG-TERM EFFICIENCIES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CAPTURE EFFICIENCIES AND DRIVE IMPROVEMENT IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS: 1) REVENUE AND MARGIN; 2) MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL EFFECTIVENESS; 3) SOURCING AND SUPPLY CHAIN; 4) COST CUTTING; AND 5) STORE OPTIMIZATION.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, NET SALES DECREASED 15.5% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER AND COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES DECREASED 13.5%. THE DECLINE IN COMPANY COMPARABLE  SALES WAS A RESULT OF LOWER AVERAGE CUSTOMER SPEND PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S MERCHANDISE MIX, AS WELL AS DECREASED STORE TRAFFIC. GROSS PROFIT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $78.8 MILLION, OR 25.1% OF SALES, COMPARED TO $120.1 MILLION, OR 32.3% OF SALES, IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, A DECREASE OF 720 BASIS POINTS. THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT REFLECTED LOWER MERCHANDISE MARGIN, AS WELL AS 270 BASIS POINTS OF DELEVERAGE IN STORE OCCUPANCY DUE TO LOWER SALES. THE DECLINE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN RATE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED PROMOTIONAL AND CLEARANCE ACTIVITY TO DRIVE TRAFFIC AND CONVERSION. THE COMPANY EXPECTS COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES AND GROSS PROFIT TRENDS TO REMAIN SOFT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AS A RESULT OF THE CONTINUED LEVEL OF CLEARANCE ACTIVITY OF LOWER PRICED, LOWER MARGIN GOODS, AND ANTICIPATES A GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW MERCHANDISING AND MARKETING INITIATIVES FOR FALL. THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION OF COST CUTTING INITIATIVES FOR FISCAL 2020, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.  OPERATING LOSS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $76.6 MILLION, OR (24.4%) OF SALES, COMPARED TO $31.3 MILLION, OR (8.4%) OF SALES, IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE COMPANY REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $81.7 MILLION, OR $(19.97) PER SHARE, WHICH INCLUDES TRANSFORMATION COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $19 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO PROFESSIONAL FEES, COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $28.5 MILLION, OR $(7.11)  PER SHARE, FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. PER SHARE FIGURES FOR THE FIRST QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019 HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE COMPANY\u2019S 1-FOR-20 REVERSE STOCK SPLIT EFFECTED ON JUNE 20, 2019. EBITDA (EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $(64.2) MILLION AND INCLUDES THE TRANSFORMATION COSTS REFERRED TO ABOVE. THIS COMPARES TO EBITDA OF $(18.7) MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. SEE \u201cRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d BELOW.  ON DECEMBER 19, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS INITIATED A PROCESS TO EVALUATE A FULL RANGE OF STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES TO ENHANCE SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND RETAINED CREDIT SUISSE TO ASSIST IN THAT EFFORT. THAT WORK IS ONGOING, WITH NO FORMAL CONCLUSION AT THIS TIME.  AS OF JUNE 1, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD $30.5 MILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, $190.5 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER ITS SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY, $50.0 MILLION OF BORROWINGS UNDER ITS FIRST-IN, LAST-OUT TRANCHE (\u201cFILO TRANCHE\u201d) AND $20.0 MILLION OF CASH BORROWINGS UNDER ITS $350 MILLION SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  15  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  MANAGEMENT REVIEWS A NUMBER OF KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THOSE KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS.  13 WEEKS ENDED  JUNE 1,  JUNE 2,  KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS  2019  2018  TOTAL SALES DECLINE  (15.5%)  (9.2%)  COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES DECLINE  (13.5%)  (8.2%)  GROSS PROFIT AS A % OF SALES  25.1%  32.3%  SG&A EXPENSES AS A % OF SALES  45.5%  37.3%  OPERATING LOSS AS A % OF SALES  (24.4%)  (8.4%)  NET LOSS (IN MILLIONS)  $(81.7  )  $(28.5  )  NET LOSS AS A % OF SALES  (26.0%)  (7.7%)  EBITDA (IN MILLIONS)  (1)  $(64.2  )  $(18.7  )  EBITDA AS A % OF SALES  (1)  (20.4%)  (5.0%)  TOTAL RETAIL SQUARE FOOTAGE (IN THOUSANDS)  7,646  7,887  (1)  SEE \"RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.\"  COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES CALCULATION  \u2014  THE COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES CALCULATION INCLUDES ALL IN-STORE SALES, INCLUDING ORDERS PLACED ONLINE INSIDE THE STORE, PROVIDED THAT THE STORE WAS OPEN PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE PRECEDING FISCAL YEAR AND WAS STILL OPEN AT PERIOD END. IN ADDITION, COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDE ALL ORDERS PLACED ONLINE OUTSIDE OF A STORE. REMODELED OR RELOCATED STORES ARE INCLUDED IF THEY MEET SPECIFIC CRITERIA. THOSE CRITERIA INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: THE NEW STORE IS WITHIN A SPECIFIED DISTANCE SERVING THE SAME MARKET, NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN STORE SIZE, AND NO SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP OR GAP BETWEEN THE STORE CLOSING AND REOPENING. SUCH STORES ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES CALCULATION IN THE FIRST FULL MONTH AFTER THE REOPENING. IF A RELOCATED OR REMODELED STORE DOES NOT MEET THE ABOVE CRITERIA, IT IS EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION UNTIL IT MEETS THE COMPANY\u2019S ESTABLISHED DEFINITION AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  NET SALES \u2013  NET SALES CONSISTED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF SALES TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS, NET OF DISCOUNTS, RETURNS AND SALES TAX, BUT ALSO INCLUDED DELIVERY REVENUES, WHOLESALE SALES AND ROYALTIES, AND GIFT CARD BREAKAGE. NET SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE $314.3 MILLION, A DECREASE OF 15.5%, COMPARED TO $371.9 MILLION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE COMPANY OPERATED 30 FEWER STORES THAN AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED 13.5%, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECLINE IN COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES WAS A RESULT OF LOWER AVERAGE CUSTOMER SPEND PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S MERCHANDISE MIX, AS WELL AS DECREASED STORE TRAFFIC. THE COMPANY EXPECTS COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES TRENDS TO REMAIN SOFT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AS A RESULT OF THE CONTINUED LEVEL OF CLEARANCE ACTIVITY OF LOWER PRICED, LOWER MARGIN GOODS AND ANTICIPATES A GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW MERCHANDISING AND MARKETING INITIATIVES FOR FALL.  SALES AT THE COMPANY\u2019S CANADIAN STORES ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY CONVERSION RATES. FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE CANADIAN DOLLAR, RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED NET SALES AND COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES BY APPROXIMATELY 20 BASIS POINTS.

THE COMPANY\u2019S FOCUS IS ON IMPROVING BRAND PROPOSITION, DRIVING SALES GROWTH AND CAPTURING OPERATING EFFICIENCIES. WHILE THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL RETURN TO POSITIVE CASH FLOWS OR PROFITABILITY, GIVEN THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT CASH POSITION, EXPECTED OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO FUND ITS OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING DEBT-RELATED PAYMENTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS, THROUGH THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS ALTERNATIVES WITH RESPECT TO ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE ON AN ONGOING BASIS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NET SALES  NET SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WERE  $2.573 BILLION  , A DECREASE OF $180.7 MILLION OR APPROXIMATELY  6.6%  , COMPARED TO  $2.754 BILLION  OF NET SALES FOR THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES.  THE DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS APPROXIMATELY  6.6%  AS COMPARED TO A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  0.6%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN STORES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE TRANSACTION AMOUNT.  THE COMPANY'S COMPARABLE SALES METRIC CONSIDERS SALES CONSUMMATED THROUGH ALL RETAIL CHANNELS - IN-STORE, ONLINE, WITH A MOBILE DEVICE OR THROUGH A CUSTOMER CONTACT CENTER. CUSTOMERS TODAY MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE COMPANY'S OMNICHANNEL ENVIRONMENT BY USING MORE THAN ONE CHANNEL WHEN MAKING A PURCHASE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IN AN INTEGRATED AND SEAMLESS CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. A FEW EXAMPLES ARE: A CUSTOMER MAY BE ASSISTED BY AN IN-STORE ASSOCIATE TO CREATE A WEDDING OR BABY REGISTRY, WHILE THE GUESTS MAY ULTIMATELY PURCHASE A GIFT FROM THE COMPANY'S WEBSITES; OR A CUSTOMER MAY RESEARCH A PARTICULAR ITEM, AND READ OTHER CUSTOMER REVIEWS ON THE COMPANY'S WEBSITES BEFORE VISITING A STORE TO CONSUMMATE THE ACTUAL PURCHASE; OR A CUSTOMER MAY RESERVE AN ITEM ONLINE FOR IN-STORE PICK UP; OR WHILE IN A STORE, A CUSTOMER MAY MAKE THE PURCHASE ON A MOBILE DEVICE FOR IN HOME DELIVERY FROM EITHER A DISTRIBUTION FACILITY, A STORE OR DIRECTLY FROM A VENDOR. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ACCEPTS RETURNS IN-STORE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CHANNEL IN WHICH THE PURCHASE WAS CONSUMMATED, THEREFORE RESULTING IN REDUCING STORE SALES BY SALES ORIGINALLY CONSUMMATED THROUGH CUSTOMER FACING DIGITAL CHANNELS. AS THE COMPANY'S RETAIL OPERATIONS ARE INTEGRATED AND IT CANNOT REASONABLY TRACK THE CHANNEL IN WHICH THE ULTIMATE SALE IS INITIATED, THE COMPANY CAN, HOWEVER, PROVIDE DIRECTIONAL INFORMATION ON WHERE THE SALE WAS CONSUMMATED.  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  , COMPARABLE SALES CONSUMMATED IN-STORE DECLINED IN THE HIGH-SINGLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE RANGE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES CONSUMMATED THROUGH CUSTOMER FACING DIGITAL CHANNELS.  -21-  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  , COMPARABLE SALES REPRESENTED  $2.489 BILLION  OF NET SALES.  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  , COMPARABLE SALES REPRESENTED  $2.667 BILLION  OF NET SALES, RESPECTIVELY.  DOMESTICS MERCHANDISE INCLUDES CATEGORIES SUCH AS BED LINENS AND RELATED ITEMS, BATH ITEMS AND KITCHEN TEXTILES. HOME FURNISHINGS INCLUDE CATEGORIES SUCH AS KITCHEN AND TABLETOP ITEMS, FINE TABLETOP, BASIC HOUSEWARES, GENERAL HOME FURNISHINGS (INCLUDING FURNITURE AND WALL DE\u0301COR), CONSUMABLES AND CERTAIN JUVENILE PRODUCTS. SALES OF DOMESTICS MERCHANDISE AND HOME FURNISHINGS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY  35.6%  AND  64.4%  OF NET SALES, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  , AND APPROXIMATELY  36.0%  AND  64.0%  OF NET SALES, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018.  GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  $887.2 MILLION  , OR  34.5%  OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH  $964.8 MILLION  , OR  35.0%  OF NET SALES, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  . IN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE, THE DECREASE IN THE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO A DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN COUPON EXPENSE AND NET DIRECT-TO-CUSTOMER SHIPPING EXPENSE. THE DECREASE IN COUPON EXPENSE WAS THE RESULT OF A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF REDEMPTIONS WITH FEWER PIECES DISTRIBUTED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COUPON AMOUNT.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS INVESTING IN THE LIFETIME VALUE OF ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH ITS ANNUAL BEYOND PLUS MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM.  THE RICHER BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM, INCLUDING TWENTY PERCENT OFF ENTIRE PURCHASE AND FREE SHIPPING, ARE REALIZED IMMEDIATELY UPON SALE AND HAD, AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE, AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S GROSS MARGIN DURING THE PERIOD OF INCREASING ENROLLMENT.  THE BEYOND PLUS MEMBERSHIP FEE IS AMORTIZED OVER THE ONE-YEAR MEMBERSHIP PERIOD.  THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THAT THE IMPACT OF THESE PROGRAMS REDUCED GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES BY APPROXIMATELY 60 BASIS POINTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND APPROXIMATELY 40 BASIS POINTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SG&A FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  $892.8 MILLION  , OR  34.7%  OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH  $883.6 MILLION  , OR  32.1%  OF NET SALES, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  . THE INCREASE IN SG&A, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO, IN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE: INCREASES IN PAYROLL AND PAYROLL-RELATED EXPENSES (PRIMARILY DUE TO SEVERANCE), TECHNOLOGY-RELATED EXPENSES, INCLUDING DEPRECIATION, AND SHAREHOLDER ACTIVITY COSTS.  GOODWILL AND OTHER IMPAIRMENTS  GOODWILL AND OTHER IMPAIRMENTS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  $401.3 MILLION  , OR  15.6%  OF NET SALES.  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS WERE $391.1 MILLION AND TRADENAME IMPAIRMENTS WERE $10.2 MILLION.  THE NON-CASH PRE-TAX GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A SUSTAINED DECLINE IN THE COMPANY'S MARKET CAPITALIZATION.  THERE WERE NO GOODWILL OR OTHER IMPAIRMENTS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018.  OPERATING (LOSS) PROFIT  OPERATING LOSS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  $406.8 MILLION  , OR  15.8%  OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH OPERATING PROFIT OF  $81.2 MILLION  , OR  2.9%  OF NET SALES, DURING THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE CHANGES IN OPERATING PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WERE THE RESULT OF THE REDUCTIONS IN GROSS PROFIT MARGIN AND THE INCREASES IN SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES AND GOODWILL AND OTHER IMPAIRMENTS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  $15.9 MILLION  , COMPARED WITH  $16.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  .  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  AND  JUNE 2, 2018  , INTEREST EXPENSE, NET PRIMARILY RELATED TO INTEREST ON THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY IN JULY 2014.  INCOME TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WAS  12.2%  , COMPARED WITH  32.4%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 2, 2018  . FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF CHARGES FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER IMPAIRMENTS AND SEVERANCE COSTS, PORTIONS OF WHICH ARE NON-DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE TAX RATES ALSO INCLUDED OTHER DISCRETE TAX ITEMS RESULTING IN NET AFTER TAX COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $12.5  MILLION AND  $3.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  AND  JUNE 2, 2018  , DUE TO DISCRETE FEDERAL AND STATE TAX ITEMS OCCURRING DURING THESE QUARTERS.  -22-  POTENTIAL VOLATILITY IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM YEAR TO YEAR MAY OCCUR AS THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED EACH YEAR TO DETERMINE WHETHER NEW INFORMATION CHANGES THE ASSESSMENT OF BOTH THE PROBABILITY THAT A TAX POSITION WILL EFFECTIVELY BE SUSTAINED AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE AMOUNT OF RECOGNIZED BENEFIT.  NET (LOSS) EARNINGS  AS A RESULT OF THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, NET LOSS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019  WERE  $371.1 MILLION  , COMPARED WITH NET EARNINGS OF  $43.6 MILLION  FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018.  GROWTH  THE COMPANY HAS UNDERTAKEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO ADAPT TO THE DYNAMIC RETAIL ENVIRONMENT AND THE EVOLVING NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS TO IMPROVE ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION AND HAS BEEN EXECUTING ON A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO TRANSFORM ITS BUSINESS AND POSITION THE COMPANY FOR LONG-TERM SUCCESS.  DURING THIS INTERIM PERIOD AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE BOARD AND MANAGEMENT TEAM ARE TAKING A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO THE COMPANY'S ON-GOING BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND HAVE IDENTIFIED FOUR KEY NEAR-TERM PRIORITIES THAT INCLUDE: 1) STABILIZING AND DRIVING TOP-LINE GROWTH; 2) RESETTING THE COST STRUCTURE; 3) REVIEWING AND OPTIMIZING THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSET BASE, INCLUDING ITS PORTFOLIO OF RETAIL BANNERS; AND 4) REFINING THE COMPANY\u2019S ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE.  THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT, IN PART, UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO EXECUTE ITS TRANSFORMATION STRATEGY SUCCESSFULLY.  FROM THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 1992 TO THE END OF THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , THE COMPANY HAS GROWN FROM 34 STORES TO  1,536  STORES PLUS THE COMPANY'S INTERACTIVE PLATFORMS, INCLUDING WEBSITES AND APPLICATIONS, AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.

FOR FISCAL  2019  , THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT CAN CONTINUE TO FINANCE ITS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING ITS GROWTH, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS, CASH DIVIDENDS, AND SHARE REPURCHASES, THROUGH EXISTING AND INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS. IN ADDITION, IF NECESSARY, THE COMPANY COULD BORROW UNDER ITS $250 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OR THE AVAILABLE BALANCES UNDER ITS LINES OF CREDIT. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL  2019  ARE PLANNED TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $350 MILLION  TO  $375 MILLION  , ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO EVALUATE ITS CAPITAL PROJECTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS ALTERNATIVES WITH RESPECT TO ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ATTACHED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S 2019 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INCLUDED AUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO AS OF AND FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, AS WELL AS  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  OVERVIEW  THE COMPANY MANUFACTURES AND DISTRIBUTES A WIDE RANGE OF DISPLAY DEVICES, ENCOMPASSING, AMONG OTHERS, INDUSTRIAL, MILITARY, MEDICAL, AND  SIMULATION DISPLAY SOLUTIONS. THE COMPANY IS COMPRISED OF ONE SEGMENT\u2014THE MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION OF DISPLAYS AND DISPLAY COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY IS ORGANIZED INTO FIVE INTERRELATED OPERATIONS AGGREGATED INTO ONE REPORTABLE SEGMENT.  \u2022  SIMULATION AND TRAINING PRODUCTS  \u2013 OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF PROJECTION DISPLAY SYSTEMS FOR USE IN  TRAINING AND SIMULATION, MILITARY, MEDICAL, ENTERTAINMENT AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS.  \u2022  CYBER SECURE PRODUCTS \u2013  OFFERS ADVANCED TEMPEST TECHNOLOGY, AND (EMSEC) PRODUCTS. THIS BUSINESS ALSO  PROVIDES VARIOUS CONTRACT SERVICES INCLUDING THE DESIGN AND TESTING SOLUTIONS FOR DEFENSE AND NICHE COMMERCIAL USES WORLDWIDE.  \u2022  DATA DISPLAY  CRTS \u2013  OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF CRTS FOR USE IN DATA DISPLAY SCREENS, INCLUDING  COMPUTER TERMINAL MONITORS AND MEDICAL MONITORING EQUIPMENT.  \u2022  BROADCAST AND CONTROL CENTER PRODUCTS \u2013  OFFERS  HIGH-END  VISUAL DISPLAY PRODUCTS FOR USE IN VIDEO WALLS AND COMMAND AND CONTROL CENTERS.  \u2022  OTHER COMPUTER PRODUCTS \u2013  OFFERS A VARIETY OF KEYBOARD PRODUCTS.  DURING FISCAL 2020, MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY IS FOCUSING KEY RESOURCES ON STRATEGIC EFFORTS TO GROW ITS BUSINESS THROUGH INTERNAL SALES OF  THE COMPANY\u2019S MORE PROFITABLE PRODUCT LINES AND REDUCE EXPENSES IN ALL AREAS OF THE BUSINESS TO BRING ITS COST STRUCTURE IN LINE WITH THE CURRENT SIZE OF THE BUSINESS. CHALLENGES FACING THE COMPANY DURING THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE.  LIQUIDITY  \u2013 THE ACCOMPANYING INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE PREPARED ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS,  WHICH CONTEMPLATES THE REALIZATION OF ASSETS AND THE SATISFACTION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY REPORTED A NET LOSS FOR THE PERIOD ENDING MAY 31, 2019 BUT HAD AN INCREASE IN LIQUID ASSETS FOR THE THREE MONTH  PERIOD. WORKING CAPITAL DECREASED DUE TO THE NEW ACCOUNTING LEASE RULES WHEREBY LEASES ARE CAPITALIZED AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE LEASE OBLIGATIONS. THE SHORT-TERM OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATION CREATED BY THIS NEW RULE WAS $0.6 MILLION  AS OF MAY 31, 2019. THE COMPANY HAS SUSTAINED LOSSES FOR THE LAST THREE OF FOUR FISCAL YEARS AND HAS SEEN OVERALL A DECLINE IN WORKING CAPITAL AND LIQUID ASSETS DURING THIS FOUR YEAR PERIOD. ANNUAL LOSSES OVER THIS TIME ARE DUE TO A COMBINATION  OF DECREASING REVENUES ACROSS CERTAIN DIVISIONS WITHOUT A COMMENSURATE REDUCTION OF EXPENSES. THE COMPANY\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL AND LIQUID ASSET POSITION ARE PRESENTED BELOW (IN THOUSANDS) AS OF MAY 31, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  MAY 31,  2019  FEBRUARY 28,  2019  WORKING CAPITAL  $2,439  $3,354  LIQUID ASSETS  $620  $410  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  VIDEO DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  MAY 31, 2019  MANAGEMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED A PLAN TO IMPROVE THE LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY HAS  BEEN FULFILLING A PLAN TO INCREASE REVENUES AT ALL THE DIVISIONS, THE COMPANY IS EXPANDING ITS CYBER SECURITY BUSINESS BY ADDING A SECOND TESTING CHAMBER FOR TESTING TEMPEST PRODUCTS ALLOWING IT TO INCREASE THE BUSINESS IN CYBER TESTING SERVICES TO  SUPPLEMENT THE PRODUCT SIDE OF THE BUSINESS. THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED ITS FIRST ORDER FOR THESE SERVICES IN ITS SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND EXPECTS THIS BUSINESS TO GROW AS THE YEAR PROGRESSES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO NOW INVOLVED IN RUGGEDIZED  DISPLAYS. EACH DIVISION IS EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES STRUCTURED TO THEIR PARTICULAR DIVISION WHICH HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE GROWTH IN REVENUES FOR THE LAST FISCAL YEAR AND IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE REVENUES THIS YEAR. THE COMPANY HAS REDUCED  OTHER EXPENSES AT THE DIVISIONS, AS WELL AS AT THE CORPORATE LOCATION WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT FURTHER DECREASES CAN BE ACHIEVED. THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED THE MERGER OF THE TWO FLORIDA BUSINESSES INTO ONE FACILITY AND THE RELOCATION OF LEXEL  IMAGING INTO A NEW FACILITY. THESE CHANGES ARE PROJECTED TO REALIZE ANNUAL SAVINGS THROUGH REDUCED EXPENSES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO EXPLORE OPTIONS TO MONETIZE CERTAIN LONG-TERM ASSETS OF THE BUSINESS. IF ADDITIONAL AND MORE PERMANENT CAPITAL IS  REQUIRED TO FUND THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE CAPITAL ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY, IF AT ALL.  THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SUCCESS OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLANS TO IMPROVE REVENUES, THE  OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS, THE PROCUREMENT OF SUITABLE FINANCING, OR A COMBINATION OF THESE. THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE POTENTIAL SUCCESS OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLAN CREATE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY  TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  INVENTORY MANAGEMENT  \u2013 THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS UNITS UTILIZE DIFFERENT INVENTORY  COMPONENTS THAN THE DIVISIONS HAD IN THE PAST. THE COMPANY HAS A MONTHLY RESERVE AT EACH OF ITS DIVISIONS TO OFFSET ANY OBSOLESCENCE ALTHOUGH MOST PURCHASES ARE FOR CURRENT ORDERS, WHICH SHOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF OBSOLESCENCE IN THE FUTURE. THE  COMPANY STILL HAS CRT INVENTORY IN STOCK AND COMPONENT PARTS FOR LEGACY PRODUCTS, ALTHOUGH IT BELIEVES THE INVENTORY WILL BE SOLD IN THE FUTURE, WILL CONTINUE TO RESERVE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL OBSOLESCENCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ITS INVENTORY RESERVES AT  MAY 31, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2019 ARE ADEQUATE.

THE  COMPANY\u2019S AYON CYBER SECURITY DIVISION WAS DOWN 34% OR $0.4 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER FROM LAST YEAR\u2019S QUARTER. THE DIVISION\u2019S DECREASE IS DUE TO A LACK OF SUFFICIENT NEW ORDERS CAUSED BY DELAYS IN RELEASES BY MAJOR CUSTOMERS. THE  DIVISION HAS BEEN A NEW TEST CHAMBER FOR TEMPEST SERVICES AND WILL SUPPLEMENT ITS PRODUCT LINE WITH THIS NEW BUSINESS. THE DISPLAY SYSTEMS DIVISION WAS DOWN 45% FOR THE QUARTER OR $0.8 MILLION, DUE PRIMARILY TO DELAYS IN PRODUCTION OF COMPONENT  PARTS FOR A VIDEO WALL PROJECT AND DELAYS IN ORDERS FROM KEY CUSTOMERS. THE OTHER DECREASE IN SALES WAS FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S NEW KEYBOARD DIVISION, WHICH POSTED SALES OF $0.3 MILLION OR A 28% DECREASE FROM LAST YEAR. THIS DIVISION IS  EXPECTED TO INCREASE ITS LEVEL OF SALES THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. THE DIVISION WAS REVAMPING ITS MARKETING STRATEGY, AND TESTING ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED ITS SALES. THE DATA DISPLAY DIVISION SHOWED AN INCREASE OF 258% DUE  TO INCREASES IN A SPECIALTY PRODUCT SOLD THROUGH ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, ULTIMATELY GOING TO OVERSEAS CUSTOMERS. THE DATA DIVISION SHOULD HAVE STEADY BUSINESS DRIVEN BY THEIR NUMBER ONE CUSTOMER\u2019S ORDERS FOR REPLACEMENT CRTS FOR THEIR  SIMULATORS AND ADDITIONAL ORDERS FOR THE SPECIALTY PRODUCT.  GROSS MARGINS  CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGINS WERE BOTH AS A PERCENTAGE TO SALES (15.7% TO 24.8%) AND ACTUAL DOLLARS ($425 THOUSAND TO $996 THOUSAND) FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018.  THE TWO FLORIDA DIVISIONS SHOWED DECREASES IN  BOTH THEIR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE TO SALES AND IN ACTUAL DOLLARS. AYON CYBER SECURITY GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS 19.0% COMPARED TO 46.8% AND THE GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS WERE $164 THOUSAND COMPARED TO $616 THOUSAND FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018. VDC DISPLAY SYSTEMS GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS 24.9% COMPARED 18.6% AND THE GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS WERE $235 THOUSAND COMPARED TO $321 THOUSAND FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED MAY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018.  THE KEYBOARD DIVISION, UNICOMP, HAD $61 THOUSAND OF  GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS OR 23.8% TO SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING MAY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $157 THOUSAND OR 43.8% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING MAY 31, 2018. THE DATA DISPLAY DIVISION SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN ITS MARGINS OF  $151 THOUSAND, BUT STILL HAD A NEGATIVE GROSS MARGIN OF $35 THOUSAND OR A NEGATIVE 5.5% FOR HERE MONTHS ENDING MAY 31, 2019.  OPERATING  EXPENSES  OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED BY 5.1% OR $56 THOUSAND FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018. THE DECREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER SALES COMMISSIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE SALARIES.    CORPORATE HAD TWO LESS ACCOUNTING STAFF AND THE VDC DISPLAY SYSTEMS HAD TWO FEWER ENGINEERS. THE COMPANY  EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO CONTROL COSTS WHILE INCREASING REVENUES WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE NEW TEMPEST TESTING CHAMBER AND THE TWO NEW REVENUE STREAMS OF TEMPEST SERVICES AND RUGGEDIZED DISPLAYS. THE COMPANY WILL BE EXPANDING ITS SALES FORCE IN THE  SECOND QUARTER.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  VIDEO DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  MAY 31, 2019  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS NEGLIGIBLE FOR THE QUARTER ENDING MAY 31, 2019 AS THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE PAYOFF OF A BUILDING IT OWNS IN  PENNSYLVANIA AND DID NOT BORROW AGAINST ITS LINE OF CREDIT DURING THE QUARTER. INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $6 THOUSAND FOR THE QUARTER ENDING MAY 31, 2018 RESULTING FROM INTEREST RECORDED RELATED TO THE LINE OF CREDIT WITH THE BANK, THE BALANCE  OWED ON A BUILDING THE COMPANY OWNS IN PENNSYLVANIA AND THE INTEREST ON THE MARGIN BALANCE IN THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT ACCOUNT, WHICH IS A 2% RATE.  OTHER INCOME/ EXPENSE  FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY EARNED $191 THOUSAND IN ROYALTY INCOME, RENTAL INCOME OF $90 THOUSAND AND INVESTMENT INCOME OF $2 THOUSAND. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018, THE COMPANY EARNED  $113 THOUSAND ON ROYALTIES, $33 THOUSAND ON THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF EQUIPMENT, $35 THOUSAND IN RENTAL INCOME, AND $11 THOUSAND IN OTHER, OFFSET BY LOSSES IN INVESTMENTS OF $38 THOUSAND.  INCOME TAXES  DUE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S  OVERALL AND HISTORICAL NET LOSS POSITION, NO INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS REPORTED FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDING MAY 31, 2019 AND MAY 31, 2018. DUE TO CONTINUED LOSSES REPORTED BY THE COMPANY, A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS ALLOCATED TO THE  DEFERRED TAX ASSET CREATED BY THESE LOSSES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE ACCOMPANYING INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE PREPARED ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS, WHICH CONTEMPLATES THE REALIZATION  OF ASSETS AND THE SATISFACTION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY REPORTED A NET LOSS FOR THE PERIOD ENDING MAY 31, 2019 BUT HAD AN INCREASE IN LIQUID ASSETS FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD. WORKING CAPITAL DECREASED DUE TO  THE NEW ACCOUNTING LEASE RULES WHEREBY LEASES ARE CAPITALIZED AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE LEASE OBLIGATIONS. THE SHORT-TERM OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATION CREATED BY THIS NEW RULE WAS $0.6 MILLION AS OF MAY 31, 2019. THE COMPANY HAS  SUSTAINED LOSSES FOR THE LAST THREE OF FOUR FISCAL YEARS AND HAS SEEN OVERALL A DECLINE IN WORKING CAPITAL AND LIQUID ASSETS DURING THIS FOUR YEAR PERIOD. ANNUAL LOSSES OVER THIS TIME ARE DUE TO A COMBINATION OF DECREASING REVENUES ACROSS CERTAIN  DIVISIONS WITHOUT A COMMENSURATE REDUCTION OF EXPENSES. THE COMPANY\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL AND LIQUID ASSET POSITION ARE PRESENTED BELOW (IN THOUSANDS) AS OF MAY 31, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  MAY 31,  2019  FEBRUARY 28,  2019  WORKING CAPITAL  $2,439  $3,354  LIQUID ASSETS  $620  $410  MANAGEMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED A PLAN TO IMPROVE THE LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN FULFILLING A  PLAN TO INCREASE REVENUES AT ALL THE DIVISIONS, THE COMPANY IS EXPANDING ITS CYBER SECURITY BUSINESS BY ADDING A SECOND TESTING CHAMBER FOR TESTING TEMPEST PRODUCTS ALLOWING IT TO INCREASE THE BUSINESS IN CYBER TESTING SERVICES TO SUPPLEMENT THE  PRODUCT SIDE OF THE BUSINESS. THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED ITS FIRST ORDER FOR THESE SERVICES IN ITS SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND EXPECTS THIS BUSINESS TO GROW AS THE YEAR PROGRESSES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO NOW INVOLVED IN RUGGEDIZED DISPLAYS. EACH  DIVISION IS EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES STRUCTURED TO THEIR PARTICULAR DIVISION WHICH HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE GROWTH IN REVENUES FOR THE LAST FISCAL YEAR AND IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE REVENUES THIS YEAR. THE COMPANY HAS REDUCED OTHER EXPENSES  AT THE DIVISIONS, AS WELL AS AT THE CORPORATE LOCATION WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT FURTHER DECREASES CAN BE ACHIEVED. THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED THE MERGER OF THE TWO FLORIDA BUSINESSES INTO ONE FACILITY AND THE RELOCATION OF LEXEL IMAGING INTO  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  VIDEO DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  MAY 31, 2019  A NEW FACILITY. THESE CHANGES ARE PROJECTED TO REALIZE ANNUAL SAVINGS THROUGH REDUCED EXPENSES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO EXPLORE OPTIONS TO MONETIZE CERTAIN LONG-TERM ASSETS OF THE BUSINESS. IF  ADDITIONAL AND MORE PERMANENT CAPITAL IS REQUIRED TO FUND THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE CAPITAL ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY, IF AT ALL.  THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SUCCESS OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLANS TO IMPROVE REVENUES, THE  OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS, THE PROCUREMENT OF SUITABLE FINANCING, OR A COMBINATION OF THESE. THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE POTENTIAL SUCCESS OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLAN CREATE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY  TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WAS $0.3 MILLION. THE NET  LOSS FROM OPERATIONS WAS $0.3 MILLION WITH CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL PROVIDING $0.6 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $0.4 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER DEPOSITS OF $0.4 MILLION, A DECREASE IN  INVENTORY OF $0.2 MILLION OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSES OF $0.4 MILLION. CASH USED BY OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018 WAS $0.4 MILLION.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES USED $0.1 MILLION. $0.1 MILLION WAS USED FOR THE PURCHASE OF CAPITAL ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019. INVESTING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED CASH OF $0.4 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018 RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS NET OF PURCHASES.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES USED $23 THOUSAND FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MAY 31, 2019 RELATED TO THE FINAL DEBT PAYMENTS MADE ON THE TELTRON  BUILDING. FINANCING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED $0.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018 RESULTING FROM PROCEEDS RECEIVED ON RELATED PARTY LOANS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DEBT REPAYMENTS.  THE COMPANY HAS A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, PURSUANT TO WHICH IT HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO 2,632,500 SHARES OF THE  COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET. ON JANUARY 20, 2014, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY APPROVED A  ONE-TIME  CONTINUATION OF THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AND AUTHORIZED THE COMPANY TO  REPURCHASE UP TO 1,500,000 ADDITIONAL SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK ON THE OPEN MARKET, DEPENDING ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE SHARES. THERE IS NO MINIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES REQUIRED TO BE REPURCHASED UNDER THE PROGRAM.  FOR THE QUARTER ENDING MAY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY DID NOT PURCHASE ANY SHARES OF THE VIDEO DISPLAY CORPORATION STOCK. THE COMPANY  REPURCHASED 8,858 SHARES AT AN AVERAGE COST OF $1.12 PER SHARE AND FOR THE QUARTER ENDING MAY 31, 2018. UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AN ADDITIONAL 490,186 SHARES REMAIN AUTHORIZED TO BE REPURCHASED BY THE COMPANY AT  MAY 31, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERIM CONDENSED  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THESE PRINCIPLES REQUIRE THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT AMOUNTS REPORTED AND DISCLOSED IN  THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES. THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT MAY INVOLVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND COMPLEXITY INCLUDE RESERVES ON INVENTORIES, REVENUE RECOGNITION, AND THE SUFFICIENCY OF  THE VALUATION RESERVE RELATED TO DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE COMPANY USES THE FOLLOWING METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING ITS ESTIMATES.  RESERVES ON  INVENTORIES  RESERVES ON INVENTORIES RESULT IN A CHARGE TO OPERATIONS WHEN THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE DECLINES BELOW COST.  MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT IN INVENTORIES FOR DECLINES IN VALUE AND ESTABLISHES RESERVES WHEN IT IS APPARENT THAT THE EXPECTED NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE INVENTORY FALLS BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  VIDEO DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  MAY 31, 2019  INVENTORY LEVELS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. SUCH REVIEWS INCLUDE OBSERVATIONS OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TRENDS OF THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS, NEW PRODUCTS BEING MARKETED, AND TECHNOLOGICAL  ADVANCES RELATIVE TO THE PRODUCT CAPABILITIES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EXISTING INVENTORIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ITS INVENTORY RESERVES AT MAY 31, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2019 ARE ADEQUATE.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE  WHEN WE TRANSFER CONTROL OF THE PROMISED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. WE DERIVE OUR REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM SALES OF  SIMULATION AND VIDEO WALL SYSTEMS, CYBER SECURE PRODUCTS, DATA DISPLAYS, AND KEYBOARDS. WE EXCLUDE SALES AND USAGE-BASED TAXES FROM REVENUE.  OUR SIMULATION AND VIDEO WALL SYSTEMS ARE CUSTOM-BUILT (USING COMMERCIAL  OFF-THE-SHELF  PRODUCTS) TO CUSTOMER SPECIFICATIONS UNDER FIXED PRICE CONTRACTS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WHETHER EACH PRODUCT AND SERVICE IS CONSIDERED TO BE A  DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION THAT SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY UNDER THE CONTRACT. GENERALLY, THESE CONTRACTS CONTAIN ONE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION (THE INSTALLATION OF A FULLY FUNCTIONAL SYSTEM). WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR THESE SYSTEMS OVER  TIME AS CONTROL IS TRANSFERRED BASED ON LABOR HOURS INCURRED ON EACH PROJECT.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE RELATED TO OUR CYBER SECURE PRODUCTS,  DATA DISPLAYS, AND KEYBOARDS AT A POINT IN TIME WHEN CONTROL IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER (GENERALLY UPON SHIPMENT OF THE PRODUCT TO THE CUSTOMER).  TIMING OF INVOICING TO CUSTOMERS MAY DIFFER FROM TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION; HOWEVER, OUR CONTRACTS DO NOT INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT FINANCING  COMPONENT AS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVOICES HAVE TERMS OF 30 DAYS OR LESS. WE ARE APPLYING THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT TO EXCLUDE FROM CONSIDERATION ANY CONTRACTS WITH PAYMENT TERMS OF ONE YEAR OR LESS AND WE NEVER OFFER TERMS EXTENDING BEYOND ONE  YEAR.  OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES  OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS  REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. DISCLOSURE IS REQUIRED WHEN THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ULTIMATE LOSS WILL EXCEED THE RECORDED PROVISION. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ARE OFTEN RESOLVED OVER LONG TIME PERIODS. ESTIMATING PROBABLE LOSSES REQUIRES  ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT OFTEN DEPEND ON JUDGMENTS ABOUT POTENTIAL ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES.  INCOME TAXES  DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED TO REFLECT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES IN FUTURE YEARS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND  LIABILITIES AND THEIR FINANCIAL REPORTING AMOUNTS BASED ON ENACTED TAX LAWS AND STATUTORY TAX RATES APPLICABLE TO THE PERIODS IN WHICH THE DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO AFFECT TAXABLE INCOME. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN NECESSARY TO  REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED. AS OF MAY 31, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2019 THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $5.8 MILLION FOR BOTH PERIODS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ASC 740, WHICH CONTAINS A  TWO-STEP  APPROACH TO RECOGNIZING AND MEASURING UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. THE FIRST STEP IS TO EVALUATE THE TAX POSITION FOR RECOGNITION BY DETERMINING IF THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES IT IS MORE  LIKELY THAN NOT, THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON AUDIT, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, IF ANY. THE SECOND STEP IS TO MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT, WHICH IS MORE THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING  REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS WHEN EVALUATING AND ESTIMATING THE COMPANY\u2019S TAX POSITIONS AND TAX BENEFITS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE PERIODIC ADJUSTMENTS. AT MAY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD ANY  LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  VIDEO DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  MAY 31, 2019  FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION AND RISK FACTORS  THIS REPORT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION THAT IS BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S BELIEFS, AS WELL AS ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY, AND  INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO MANAGEMENT.

THE 2019 AND 2018 TWO FISCAL QUARTERS REFERENCED HEREIN REPRESENT THE TWENTY-FOUR-WEEK PERIODS ENDED JUNE 16, 2019 AND JUNE 17, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  OVERVIEW  DOMINO\u2019S IS THE LARGEST PIZZA COMPANY IN THE WORLD BASED ON GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WITH MORE THAN 16,300 LOCATIONS IN OVER 85 MARKETS. FOUNDED IN 1960, OUR ROOTS ARE IN CONVENIENT PIZZA DELIVERY, WHILE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SALES ALSO COME FROM CARRYOUT CUSTOMERS. DOMINO\u2019S GENERATES REVENUES AND EARNINGS BY CHARGING ROYALTIES AND FEES TO OUR INDEPENDENT FRANCHISEES. THE COMPANY ALSO GENERATES REVENUES AND EARNINGS BY SELLING FOOD, EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO FRANCHISEES PRIMARILY IN THE U.S. AND CANADA, AND BY OPERATING A NUMBER OF OUR OWN STORES IN THE U.S. FRANCHISEES PROFIT BY SELLING PIZZA AND OTHER COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS TO THEIR LOCAL CUSTOMERS. IN OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE GENERALLY GRANT GEOGRAPHICAL RIGHTS TO THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA  \u00ae  BRAND TO MASTER FRANCHISEES. THESE MASTER FRANCHISEES ARE CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL AREA, AND THEY CAN PROFIT BY  SUB-FRANCHISING  AND SELLING INGREDIENTS AND EQUIPMENT TO THOSE  SUB-FRANCHISEES,  AS WELL AS BY RUNNING PIZZA STORES DIRECTLY. EVERYONE IN THE SYSTEM CAN BENEFIT, INCLUDING THE END CONSUMER, WHO CAN FEED THEIR FAMILY DOMINO\u2019S MENU ITEMS CONVENIENTLY AND ECONOMICALLY.  OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE DRIVEN LARGELY BY RETAIL SALES AT OUR FRANCHISE AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES. CHANGES IN RETAIL SALES ARE DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN SAME STORE SALES AND STORE COUNTS. WE MONITOR BOTH OF THESE METRICS VERY CLOSELY, AS THEY DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS, AND WE STRIVE TO CONSISTENTLY INCREASE BOTH METRICS. RETAIL SALES DRIVE ROYALTY PAYMENTS FROM FRANCHISEES, AS WELL AS COMPANY-OWNED STORE AND SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES. RETAIL SALES ARE PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA  \u00ae  BRAND, THE RESULTS OF OUR EXTENSIVE ADVERTISING THROUGH VARIOUS MEDIA CHANNELS, THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND DIGITAL ORDERING, OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR STRONG AND PROVEN BUSINESS MODEL AND THE OVERALL GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

THE SAME STORE SALES GROWTH FOR THESE STORES IS REFLECTED IN U.S. FRANCHISE STORES IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WE EXPERIENCED GLOBAL RETAIL SALES GROWTH. OUR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH REMAINED POSITIVE BUT WAS PRESSURED BY OUR CURRENT STRATEGY TO INCREASE STORE CONCENTRATION IN CERTAIN MARKETS WHERE WE COMPETE.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ALSO CONTINUED OUR GLOBAL EXPANSION WITH THE OPENING OF 200 NET NEW STORES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, BRINGING OUR  YEAR-TO-DATE  TOTAL TO 400. WE OPENED 158 NET NEW STORES INTERNATIONALLY AND 42 NET NEW STORES IN THE U.S. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. OVERALL, WE BELIEVE THIS GLOBAL STORE GROWTH, ALONG WITH OUR STRONG SALES, EMPHASIS ON TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONS, AND MARKETING INITIATIVES, HAVE COMBINED TO STRENGTHEN OUR BRAND.  GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WHICH ARE TOTAL WORLDWIDE RETAIL SALES AT FRANCHISE AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES, INCREASED 5.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 4.8% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN WORLDWIDE STORE COUNTS DURING THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS AS WELL AS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES PARTIALLY OFFSET THIS INCREASE, RESULTING FROM A GENERALLY STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR WHEN COMPARED TO THE CURRENCIES IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. U.S. SAME STORE SALES GROWTH REFLECTED THE SUSTAINED POSITIVE SALES TRENDS AND THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS, MARKETING AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH ALSO REFLECTED CONTINUED POSITIVE PERFORMANCE.  TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED $32.2 MILLION, OR 4.1%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $82.8 MILLION, OR 5.3%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN AND GLOBAL FRANCHISE REVENUES. THE INCREASES IN INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE ALSO PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORE REVENUES RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF 59 COMPANY-OWNED STORES TO CERTAIN OF OUR EXISTING U.S. FRANCHISEES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 (THE \u201cSECOND QUARTER STORE SALE\u201d). THESE CHANGES IN REVENUES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $12.8 MILLION, OR 10.1%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $22.8 MILLION, OR 8.8%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER ROYALTY REVENUES FROM U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISED STORES, AS WELL AS HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN MARGINS. HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND OTHER AREAS AND A $2.4 MILLION  PRE-TAX  LOSS RELATED TO THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE INCREASES. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  NET INCOME INCREASED $15.0 MILLION, OR 19.3%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $18.8 MILLION, OR 11.3%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, DRIVEN BY HIGHER INCOME FROM OPERATIONS AND LOWER TAX EXPENSE RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM HIGHER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION. NET INCOME FURTHER BENEFITED FROM LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 RESULTING FROM $3.3 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL INTEREST EXPENSE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH OUR RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTION COMPLETED ON APRIL 24, 2018 (THE \u201c2018 RECAPITALIZATION\u201d). THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM A HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE AND A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE FOLLOWING THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION.

THESE DECREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. COMPANY-OWNED SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 2.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.6% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

U.S. FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 3.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 3.5% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER VOLUMES FROM INCREASED ORDERS RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF U.S. FRANCHISE STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD AND AN INCREASE IN MARKET BASKET PRICING. OUR MARKET BASKET PRICING TO STORES INCREASED 2.3% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.0% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WHICH RESULTED IN AN ESTIMATED INCREASE IN U.S. SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES OF $5.6 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND $11.8 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN  REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS INCREASED $1.8 MILLION, OR 4.4%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $4.0 MILLION, OR 4.9%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER VOLUMES FROM INCREASED ORDERS AND AN INCREASE IN MARKET BASKET PRICING. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OF $1.7 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND $3.8 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEE REVENUES  REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEES INCREASED $3.7 MILLION, OR 7.1%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $5.8 MILLION, OR 5.6%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD AND HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OF $3.0 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND $6.6 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 2.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.1% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 4.0% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND INCREASED 4.4% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COST OF SALES / OPERATING MARGIN  SECOND QUARTER  SECOND QUARTER  TWO FISCAL  TWO FISCAL  OF 2019  OF 2018  QUARTERS OF 2019  QUARTERS OF 2018  CONSOLIDATED REVENUES  $811.6  100.0%  $779.4  100.0%  $1,647.6  100.0%  $1,564.8  100.0%  CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES  495.0  61.0%  485.8  62.3%  1,008.7  61.2%  971.3  62.1%  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN  $316.7  39.0%  $293.6  37.7%  $639.0  38.8%  $593.4  37.9%  COST OF SALES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF COMPANY-OWNED STORE AND SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS INCURRED TO GENERATE RELATED REVENUES. COMPONENTS OF CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES PRIMARILY INCLUDE FOOD, LABOR, DELIVERY AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN (WHICH WE DEFINE AS REVENUES LESS COST OF SALES) INCREASED $23.1 MILLION, OR 7.9%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $45.6 MILLION, OR 7.7%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GLOBAL FRANCHISE REVENUES AND HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN VOLUMES. FRANCHISE REVENUES DO NOT HAVE A COST OF SALES COMPONENT, SO CHANGES IN THESE REVENUES HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE OPERATING MARGIN.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES, THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 1.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. COMPANY-OWNED STORE OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

OPERATING MARGIN IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY HIGHER LABOR COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. AS A PERCENTAGE OF STORE REVENUES, THE STORE OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE CHANGES IN OPERATING MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  \u2022  FOOD COSTS DECREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 26.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND DECREASED 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 27.0% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE LEVERAGING OF HIGHER SAME STORE SALES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN EFFICIENCY. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FOOD PRICES.  \u2022  LABOR COSTS DECREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 29.4% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 30.2% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCTION IN LABOR COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF STORE REVENUES IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE TO THE HIGH LABOR RATES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE SOLD STORES OPERATED. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND FULLY OFFSET IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE LABOR RATES IN OUR REMAINING COMPANY-OWNED STORE MARKETS.

AS A PERCENTAGE OF SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES, THE SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO PROCUREMENT SAVINGS AND LOWER INSURANCE EXPENSE, OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER LABOR COSTS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED $2.7 MILLION, OR 3.2%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $8.2 MILLION, OR 4.8%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND OTHER AREAS. A $2.4 MILLION  PRE-TAX  LOSS RELATED TO THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASES.  U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING EXPENSES  U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING EXPENSES INCREASED $7.6 MILLION, OR 9.4%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $14.5 MILLION, OR 8.9%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE TO HIGHER U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING REVENUES. U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING COSTS ARE ACCRUED AND EXPENSED WHEN THE RELATED U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED, AS OUR CONSOLIDATED  NOT-FOR-PROFIT  ADVERTISING FUND IS OBLIGATED TO EXPEND SUCH REVENUES ON ADVERTISING AND THESE REVENUES CANNOT BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET DECREASED $2.0 MILLION, OR 5.7%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $2.5 MILLION, OR 3.9%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE, NET IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 RESULTED FROM $3.3 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL INTEREST EXPENSE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND MORE THAN OFFSET IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 BY A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER AVERAGE BORROWINGS RESULTING FROM THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION AND OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES. A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  THE COMPANY\u2019S WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE INCREASED TO 4.1% IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, FROM 4.0% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND 3.9% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018, RESULTING FROM THE HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON THE DEBT OUTSTANDING IN 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES DECREASED $0.2 MILLION, OR 1.2%, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $1.5 MILLION, OR 5.2%, IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. HIGHER  PRE-TAX  INCOME CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER TAX EXPENSE IN BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, BUT THESE INCREASES WERE FULLY OFFSET IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND PARTIALLY OFFSET IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 BY HIGHER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED TO 12.9% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND DECREASED TO 14.0% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 15.1% IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND 14.7% IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE OPERATED WITH MINIMAL POSITIVE WORKING CAPITAL OR NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OUR RECEIVABLE COLLECTION PERIODS AND INVENTORY TURN RATES ARE FASTER THAN THE NORMAL PAYMENT TERMS ON OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES. WE GENERALLY COLLECT OUR RECEIVABLES WITHIN THREE WEEKS FROM THE DATE OF THE RELATED SALE, AND WE GENERALLY EXPERIENCE 35 TO 45 INVENTORY TURNS PER YEAR. IN ADDITION, OUR SALES ARE NOT TYPICALLY SEASONAL, WHICH FURTHER LIMITS OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE USE OF OUR ONGOING CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO SERVICE OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK REDUCES OUR WORKING CAPITAL AMOUNTS. AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL OF $73.5 MILLION, EXCLUDING RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $152.7 MILLION, ADVERTISING FUND ASSETS, RESTRICTED, OF $117.7 MILLION AND ADVERTISING FUND LIABILITIES OF $113.4 MILLION. WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDES TOTAL UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $108.3 MILLION.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, OUR INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. BUSINESSES GREW STORE COUNTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE OUR UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, EXCESS CASH FROM OUR RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTIONS AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INVEST IN OUR CORE BUSINESS, SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL COMMITMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS OF JUNE 16, 2019.  BASED UPON OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF OPERATIONS AND ANTICIPATED GROWTH, WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, OUR CURRENT UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTE FACILITY WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO FUND THESE ITEMS AND CONTINUE TO REDUCE DEBT COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE EVENTS DESCRIBED UNDER \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OR THAT FUTURE BORROWINGS WILL BE AVAILABLE UNDER THE VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES OR OTHERWISE TO ENABLE US TO SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS OR TO MAKE ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OUR FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE, EXTEND OR REFINANCE OUR FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES AND TO SERVICE, EXTEND OR REFINANCE OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES WILL BE SUBJECT TO FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TO FINANCIAL, BUSINESS AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESTRICTED CASH  AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $115.9 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH HELD FOR FUTURE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS AND OTHER WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF OUR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATION STRUCTURE, $36.6 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH HELD IN A THREE-MONTH INTEREST RESERVE AS REQUIRED BY THE RELATED DEBT AGREEMENTS AND $0.2 MILLION OF OTHER RESTRICTED CASH FOR A TOTAL OF $152.7 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE ALSO HELD $61.3 MILLION OF ADVERTISING FUND RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, WHICH CAN ONLY BE USED FOR ACTIVITIES THAT PROMOTE THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA BRAND.  LONG-TERM DEBT  AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $3.45 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, OF WHICH $35.9 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY. OUR FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES FROM THE RECAPITALIZATIONS WE COMPLETED IN 2018, 2017 AND 2015 HAVE ORIGINAL SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF $17.6 MILLION IN THE REMAINDER OF 2019, $35.3 MILLION IN EACH OF 2020 AND 2021, $888.0 MILLION IN 2022, $26.3 MILLION IN EACH OF 2023 AND 2024, $1.14 BILLION IN 2025, $14.0 MILLION IN 2026 AND $1.27 BILLION IN 2027. AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND $126.9 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING, NET OF LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED OF $48.1 MILLION. THE LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR CASUALTY INSURANCE PROGRAMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN CENTER LEASES. BORROWINGS UNDER THE VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES ARE AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND, SUBJECT TO OTHER LIMITATIONS, OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS  OUR OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN FUNDED BY EXCESS CASH FLOWS. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO $750.0 MILLION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 12,295 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $3.3 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $269.14 PER SHARE. DURING THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 45,844 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $11.5 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $249.82 PER SHARE. AS OF JUNE 16, 2019, WE HAD A TOTAL REMAINING AUTHORIZED AMOUNT FOR SHARE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY $147.3 MILLION.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 905,556 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $219.0 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $241.82 PER SHARE. DURING THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 1,353,564 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $320.1 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $236.46 PER SHARE.  DIVIDENDS  ON MARCH 29, 2019, THE COMPANY PAID A $0.65 DIVIDEND TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF MARCH 15, 2019. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, ON APRIL 23, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A $0.65 PER SHARE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON ITS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF JUNE 14, 2019, WHICH WAS PAID ON JUNE 28, 2019.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE SECOND QUARTER, ON JULY 10, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A $0.65 PER SHARE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON ITS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF SEPTEMBER 13, 2019 TO BE PAID ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.

THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DURING 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 AND WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN ADVERTISING FUND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, RESTRICTED IN 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $2.5 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WHICH CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF $25.7 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND SUPPLY CHAIN CENTERS). THIS USE OF CASH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MATURITIES OF ADVERTISING FUND INVESTMENTS, RESTRICTED OF $15.2 MILLION AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS OF $8.2 MILLION, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $43.8 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018, WHICH CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF $37.3 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES, SUPPLY CHAIN CENTERS AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES) AND PURCHASES OF RESTRICTED ADVERTISING FUND INVESTMENTS OF $35.2 MILLION. THESE USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MATURITIES OF RESTRICTED ADVERTISING FUND INVESTMENTS OF $29.0 MILLION.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $114.3 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, PRIMARILY RELATED TO REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $82.9 MILLION (OF WHICH $65.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES), DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS OF $26.7 MILLION, PURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK OF $11.5 MILLION UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND TAX PAYMENTS FOR RESTRICTED STOCK UPON VESTING OF $2.6 MILLION. THESE USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS OF $9.3 MILLION.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $30.1 MILLION IN THE TWO FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018.

SEE PART I\u2014ITEM 1A OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018  AND PART II\u2014ITEM 1A OF THE COMPANY\u2019S QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING REASONS THAT ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS, DEVELOPMENTS AND BUSINESS DECISIONS CONTEMPLATED BY OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THE REPORT, DOCUMENT, PRESS RELEASE, WEBCAST, CALL, MATERIALS OR OTHER COMMUNICATION IN WHICH THEY ARE MADE.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LAW, WE DO NOT ASSUME ANY OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR REVISE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS OR OTHERWISE.  OVERVIEW  GENERAL  AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S GEOGRAPHIC AND INDUSTRY DIVERSITY, THE COMPANY FACES A VARIETY OF OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES, INCLUDING RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT (PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO COMPUTING, AUTOMATION, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, MOBILE CONNECTIVITY, COMMUNICATIONS AND DIGITIZATION) IN MOST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SERVED MARKETS, THE EXPANSION AND EVOLUTION OF OPPORTUNITIES IN HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS, TRENDS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A GLOBAL LABOR FORCE, CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMPETITORS AND INCREASING REGULATION.  THE COMPANY OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN MOST MARKETS, AND THE COMPANY\u2019S LONG-TERM GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY WILL DEPEND IN PARTICULAR ON ITS ABILITY TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS IN HIGH-GROWTH GEOGRAPHIES AND HIGH-GROWTH MARKET SEGMENTS, IDENTIFY, CONSUMMATE AND INTEGRATE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITIONS, DEVELOP INNOVATIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH HIGHER GROSS PROFIT MARGINS, EXPAND AND IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES FORCE, CONTINUE TO REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE OPERATING EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY, AND EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE DEMANDS OF AN INCREASINGLY REGULATED ENVIRONMENT.  THE COMPANY IS MAKING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS, ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, TO ADDRESS THE RAPID PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN ITS SERVED MARKETS AND TO GLOBALIZE ITS MANUFACTURING, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND CUSTOMER-FACING RESOURCES (PARTICULARLY IN HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS) IN ORDER TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS.  BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND OUTLOOK  DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF  2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES INCREASED  3.5%  COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  .  WHILE DIFFERENCES EXIST AMONG THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESSES, ON AN OVERALL BASIS, DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCREASED DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF  2019  COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  .  THIS DEMAND, TOGETHER WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN SALES GROWTH INITIATIVES AND THE OTHER BUSINESS-SPECIFIC FACTORS DISCUSSED BELOW, CONTRIBUTED TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR CORE SALES GROWTH OF  5.5%  (FOR THE DEFINITION OF \u201cCORE SALES\u201d OR \u201cCORE REVENUE\u201d REFER TO \u201c\u2014RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d BELOW).  GEOGRAPHICALLY, BOTH HIGH-GROWTH AND DEVELOPED MARKETS CONTRIBUTED TO CORE SALES GROWTH DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF  2019  .  CORE REVENUES IN HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS INCREASED AT A HIGH-SINGLE DIGIT RATE DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  LED PRIMARILY BY CONTINUED STRENGTH IN CHINA.  HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  31%  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TOTAL SALES IN THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF  2019  .  CORE REVENUES IN DEVELOPED MARKETS INCREASED AT A MID-SINGLE DIGIT RATE DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF  2019  LED PRIMARILY BY GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE.  FOR THE  SIX  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  , SALES INCREASED BY A TOTAL OF  3.5%  , WITH  5.5%  ATTRIBUTABLE TO CORE SALES GROWTH, AS A RESULT OF THE SAME FACTORS WHICH DROVE SALES GROWTH FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF  2019  .  THE COMPANY EXPECTS OVERALL YEAR-OVER-YEAR SALES GROWTH FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019  BUT REMAINS CAUTIOUS ABOUT CHALLENGES DUE TO MACRO-ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING GLOBAL UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO TRADE, TARIFFS, MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES BY GEOGRAPHICAL REGION DURING THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  AND  JUNE 29, 2018  , REFER TO NOTE  2  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S NET EARNINGS FOR THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  TOTALED  $731 MILLION  OR  $0.97  PER DILUTED SHARE AND APPROXIMATELY  $1.1 BILLION  OR  $1.43  PER DILUTED SHARE, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO  $674 MILLION  OR  $0.95  PER DILUTED SHARE AND APPROXIMATELY  $1.2 BILLION  OR  $1.75  PER DILUTED SHARE, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2018  .  REFER TO \u201c\u2014RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE DRIVERS IN THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR BOTH THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  .  THE TAX-RELATED CHARGES DISCUSSED BELOW IN \u201c\u2014RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u2014INCOME TAXES\u201d ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR  DECREASE  IN NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  SIX  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019.  ACQUISITIONS AND PROPOSED ENVISTA INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING  THE COMPANY\u2019S GROWTH STRATEGY CONTEMPLATES FUTURE ACQUISITIONS.  OPERATIONS AND RESULTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE RATE AND EXTENT TO WHICH APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVAILABLE AND SUCCESSFULLY CONSUMMATED, ACQUIRED BUSINESSES ARE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATED AND ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES OR COST SAVINGS ARE ACHIEVED.  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PENDING ACQUISITION OF THE BIOPHARMA BUSINESS OF GE LIFE SCIENCES AND THE ANTICIPATED FINANCING THEREOF, REFER TO NOTE 3 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ANTICIPATED ENVISTA INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING, REFER TO NOTE 4 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  DURING THE  SIX  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  THE COMPANY ACQUIRED  THREE  BUSINESSES FOR TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF  $327 MILLION  IN CASH, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED.  THE BUSINESSES ACQUIRED COMPLEMENT EXISTING UNITS OF THE LIFE SCIENCES SEGMENT.  THE AGGREGATE ANNUAL SALES OF THESE  BUSINESSES AT THE TIME OF THEIR ACQUISITION, BASED ON THE COMPANIES\u2019 REVENUES FOR THEIR LAST  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMPLETED FISCAL YEAR PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION, WERE  $68 MILLION.  THE COMPANY PRELIMINARILY RECORDED AN AGGREGATE OF  $210 MILLION  OF GOODWILL RELATED TO THESE ACQUISITIONS.  CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES  ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES  NEGATIVELY  IMPACTED REPORTED SALES BY APPROXIMATELY  3.0%  AND  3.5%  FOR THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MOST MAJOR CURRENCIES IN THE FIRST HALF OF  2019  .  IF THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AS OF  JUNE 28, 2019  WERE TO PREVAIL THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF  2019  , CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES WOULD REDUCE THE COMPANY\u2019S ESTIMATED FULL YEAR  2019  SALES BY APPROXIMATELY 1.5% ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS.  ANY FUTURE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR CURRENCIES WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR, AND ANY WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR CURRENCIES WOULD POSITIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR.  UK\u2019S REFERENDUM DECISION TO EXIT THE EU (\u201cBREXIT\u201d)  IN A REFERENDUM ON JUNE 23, 2016, VOTERS APPROVED FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM (\u201cUK\u201d) TO EXIT THE EU.  THE TIMING OF THE UK\u2019S EXIT FROM THE EU REMAINS UNCERTAIN; THE EU HAS EXTENDED THE DEADLINE FOR THE UK TO EXIT THE EU UNTIL OCTOBER 31, 2019.  WITH THE TERMS OF THE UK\u2019S WITHDRAWAL AND THE NATURE OF ITS FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EU STILL BEING DECIDED, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE STATUS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS AND PLAN FOR POTENTIAL IMPACTS.  TO MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BREXIT ON THE IMPORT AND EXPORT OF GOODS TO AND FROM THE UK, THE COMPANY HAS INCREASED ITS WAREHOUSE CAPACITY AND THE LEVEL OF INVENTORY WITHIN THE UK.  FOR GOODS THE COMPANY MANUFACTURES WITHIN THE UK AND EXPORTS TO OTHER COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY HAS MANUFACTURED AND SHIPPED ADDITIONAL GOODS FOR STORAGE IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UK IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN INVENTORY REQUIRED TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND IN THE EVENT OF DISRUPTION IN SHIPMENTS FROM THE UK.  THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF BREXIT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL RESULTS IS UNCERTAIN.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO THE \u201cITEM 1A\u2014RISK FACTORS\u201d SECTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  THE COMPANY HAS 8 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN THE UK, AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , LESS THAN 5% OF OUR SALES WERE DERIVED FROM CUSTOMERS LOCATED IN THE UK; HOWEVER, THE IMPACT OF BREXIT COULD ALSO IMPACT OUR SALES OUTSIDE THE UK.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NON-GAAP MEASURES  IN THIS REPORT, REFERENCES TO THE NON-GAAP MEASURE OF CORE SALES (ALSO REFERRED TO AS CORE REVENUES OR SALES/REVENUES FROM EXISTING BUSINESSES) REFER TO SALES CALCULATED ACCORDING TO U.S. GAAP, BUT EXCLUDING.  \u2022  SALES FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES; AND  \u2022  THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  REFERENCES TO SALES OR OPERATING PROFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACQUISITIONS OR ACQUIRED BUSINESSES REFER TO SALES OR OPERATING PROFIT, AS APPLICABLE, FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES RECORDED PRIOR TO THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ACQUISITION LESS THE AMOUNT OF SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT, AS APPLICABLE, ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIVESTED PRODUCT LINES NOT CONSIDERED DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  THE PORTION OF REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN.  \u2022  THE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGE IN REVENUE (EXCLUDING SALES FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES); AND  \u2022  THE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGE IN REVENUE (EXCLUDING SALES FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES) AFTER APPLYING CURRENT PERIOD FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  CORE SALES GROWTH SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A REPLACEMENT FOR OR SUPERIOR TO, SALES, AND MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT REPORTING THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF CORE SALES GROWTH PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BY HELPING IDENTIFY UNDERLYING GROWTH TRENDS IN DANAHER\u2019S BUSINESS AND FACILITATING COMPARISONS OF DANAHER\u2019S REVENUE PERFORMANCE WITH ITS PERFORMANCE IN PRIOR AND FUTURE PERIODS AND TO DANAHER\u2019S PEERS.  MANAGEMENT ALSO USES CORE SALES GROWTH TO MEASURE THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND USES IT AS ONE OF THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S EXECUTIVE SHORT-TERM CASH INCENTIVE PROGRAM.  THE COMPANY EXCLUDES THE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION FROM CORE SALES BECAUSE CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS NOT UNDER MANAGEMENT\u2019S CONTROL, IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY AND CAN OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS.  THE COMPANY EXCLUDES THE EFFECT OF ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURE-RELATED ITEMS BECAUSE THE NATURE, SIZE, TIMING AND NUMBER OF ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES CAN VARY DRAMATICALLY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD AND BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND ITS PEERS AND CAN ALSO OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS AND MAKE COMPARISONS OF LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE DIFFICULT.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THROUGHOUT THIS DISCUSSION, REFERENCES TO SALES VOLUME REFER TO THE IMPACT OF BOTH PRICE AND UNIT SALES AND REFERENCES TO PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS GENERALLY REFER TO IMPROVED COST-EFFICIENCIES RESULTING FROM THE ONGOING APPLICATION OF THE DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM.

IN JANUARY 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITH RESPECT TO APPROXIMATELY  $1.9 BILLION  OF ITS U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED BONDS TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT THESE U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED BONDS TO OBLIGATIONS DENOMINATED IN DANISH KRONER, JAPANESE YEN, EURO AND SWISS FRANC.  INTEREST INCOME OF  $26 MILLION  AND  $42 MILLION  FOR THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, WAS  $24 MILLION  HIGHER  AND  $38 MILLION  HIGHER  THAN THE COMPARABLE PERIODS OF  2018  , RESPECTIVELY, DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER AVERAGE CASH BALANCES DURING 2019 ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CASH RECEIVED FROM THE FIRST QUARTER 2019 COMMON STOCK AND MANDATORY CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK (\u201cMCPS\u201d) OFFERINGS COMPLETED IN PREPARATION FOR THE GE BIOPHARMA ACQUISITION.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  ALSO INCLUDES NET DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS OF  $15 MILLION  (  $0.02  PER DILUTED SHARE) FROM THE RELEASE OF RESERVES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS DUE TO THE EXPIRATION OF STATUTES OF LIMITATION, BENEFITS FROM CHANGES IN TAX LAW IN A CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTION AND EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHARGES FROM AUDIT SETTLEMENTS  .  THESE DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS DECREASED THE REPORTED TAX RATE BY  1.7%.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR  THE  SIX  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  DIFFERS FROM THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF  21.0%  PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF NET DISCRETE CHARGES OF  $227 MILLION  (  $0.31  PER DILUTED SHARE) RELATED PRIMARILY TO CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH PRIOR PERIOD UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, NET OF THE RELEASE OF RESERVES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS DUE TO THE EXPIRATION OF STATUTES OF LIMITATION, RELEASE OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN TAX LAW AND EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  THESE DISCRETE INCOME TAX CHARGES INCREASED THE REPORTED TAX RATE BY  14.0%.  THESE CHARGES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BENEFITS FROM THE IMPACT OF EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHICH GENERALLY ARE TAXED AT RATES LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL RATE.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR BOTH THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2018  WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF  21.0%  DUE PRINCIPALLY TO THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHICH OVERALL ARE TAXED AT RATES LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL RATE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE AND SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2018  REFLECTS A U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE OF  21.0%  FROM THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\u201cTCJA\u201d), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NEW MINIMUM TAX ON CERTAIN NON-U.S. EARNINGS AS A RESULT OF THE TCJA.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2018  ALSO INCLUDES NET TAX BENEFITS OF  $9 MILLION  (  $0.01  PER DILUTED SHARE) FOR RELEASE OF RESERVES UPON THE EXPIRATION OF STATUTES OF LIMITATION AND EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH PRIOR PERIOD UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND OTHER MATTERS.  THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS GLOBALLY, AND FILES NUMEROUS CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE INCOME TAX RETURNS IN FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.  THE NON-U.S. COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE INCLUDE CHINA, DENMARK, GERMANY, SINGAPORE, SWITZERLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A CHANGE IN THE STATUTORY TAX RATE OF ANY INDIVIDUAL FOREIGN COUNTRY WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GIVEN THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISPERSION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME.  THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ROUTINELY EXAMINED BY VARIOUS DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TAXING AUTHORITIES.  THE IRS HAS COMPLETED THE EXAMINATIONS OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS THROUGH 2011 AND IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2012 THROUGH 2017.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS SUBSIDIARIES IN AUSTRIA, BELGIUM, CANADA, CHINA, DENMARK, FRANCE, GERMANY, INDIA, JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND, SINGAPORE, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM AND VARIOUS OTHER COUNTRIES, STATES AND PROVINCES THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT FOR YEARS RANGING FROM 2004 THROUGH 2017.  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THE IRS PROPOSED SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANY\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME FOR THE YEARS 2012 THROUGH 2015 WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFERRAL OF TAX ON CERTAIN PREMIUM INCOME RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S SELF-INSURANCE PROGRAMS.  FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES, THE RECOGNITION OF PREMIUM INCOME HAS BEEN DEFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. TAX LAWS RELATED TO INSURANCE.  THE IRS IS CHALLENGING THE DEFERRAL OF PREMIUMS FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF INSURANCE POLICIES.  THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS WOULD INCREASE THE COMPANY\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME OVER THE 2012-2015 PERIOD BY APPROXIMATELY  $2.7 BILLION.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE POSITIONS THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN IN ITS U.S. TAX RETURNS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT TAX LAWS, INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THESE POSITIONS AND IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING ALL OF ITS ALTERNATIVES.  DUE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA IN 2017 AND THE RESULTING REDUCTION IN THE U.S. CORPORATE TAX RATE FOR YEARS AFTER 2017, THE COMPANY REVALUED ITS DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DEFERRED PREMIUM INCOME FROM  35.0%  TO  21.0%.  IF THE COMPANY IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING THESE ASSESSMENTS, THE TAXES OWED TO THE IRS MAY BE COMPUTED UNDER THE PREVIOUS  35.0%  STATUTORY TAX RATE AND THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO REVALUE THE RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES FROM  21.0%  TO  35.0%  ,  WHICH IN ADDITION TO ANY INTEREST DUE ON THE AMOUNTS ASSESSED, WOULD REQUIRE A CHARGE TO FUTURE EARNINGS.  THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER IS UNCERTAIN, COULD TAKE MANY YEARS AND COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING ITS CASH FLOWS AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  TAX AUTHORITIES IN DENMARK HAVE RAISED SIGNIFICANT ISSUES RELATED TO INTEREST ACCRUED BY CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES.  ON DECEMBER 10, 2013, THE COMPANY RECEIVED ASSESSMENTS FROM  THE DANISH TAX AUTHORITY (\u201cSKAT\u201d)  TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  DKK 1.7 BILLION  INCLUDING INTEREST THROUGH  JUNE 28, 2019  (APPROXIMATELY  $262 MILLION  BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATE AS OF  JUNE 28, 2019  ), IMPOSING WITHHOLDING TAX RELATING TO INTEREST ACCRUED IN DENMARK ON BORROWINGS FROM CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES FOR THE YEARS 2004-2009.  THE COMPANY APPEALED THESE ASSESSMENTS TO THE DANISH NATIONAL TAX TRIBUNAL IN 2014, WHICH APPEAL HAS BEEN PENDING AWAITING THE OUTCOME OF OTHER CASES BROUGHT TO THE COURT OF JUSTICE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION (\u201cCJEU\u201d).  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN DISCUSSIONS WITH SKAT AND ANTICIPATES RECEIVING AN ASSESSMENT FOR SIMILAR WITHHOLDING TAX MATTERS FOR THE YEARS 2010-2012 AND 2013-2015 TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  DKK 1.0 BILLION  AND  DKK 720 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY,  INCLUDING INTEREST THROUGH  JUNE 28, 2019  (APPROXIMATELY  $155 MILLION  AND  $110 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY,  BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATE AS OF  JUNE 28, 2019  ).  IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE CJEU DECIDED SEVERAL OTHER CASES RELATED TO DANISH WITHHOLDING TAX ON DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST.  IN THESE CASES, THE CJEU RULED THAT THE EXEMPTION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS FROM WITHHOLDING TAXES PROVIDED IN THE APPLICABLE  EU  DIRECTIVE SHOULD BE DENIED WHERE TAXPAYERS USE THE DIRECTIVE FOR ABUSIVE OR FRAUDULENT PURPOSES, AND THAT IT IS UP TO THE NATIONAL COURTS TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE POSITIONS THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN IN DENMARK ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT TAX LAWS AND IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ITS POSITIONS.  THE COMPANY INTENDS ON PURSUING THIS MATTER THROUGH THE DANISH HIGH COURT SHOULD THE APPEAL TO THE DANISH NATIONAL TAX TRIBUNAL BE UNSUCCESSFUL.  THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR DECISIONS OF BOTH THE DANISH COURTS AND THE CJEU AND EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THESE COURT RULINGS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S TAX POSITIONS IN DENMARK.  THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER IS UNCERTAIN, COULD TAKE MANY YEARS, AND COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING ITS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 TO BE APPROXIMATELY 20.0%.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD VARY AS A RESULT OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  THE EXPECTED RATE FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019  INCLUDES THE ANTICIPATED DISCRETE INCOME TAX BENEFITS FROM EXCESS TAX DEDUCTIONS RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION IN TAX EXPENSE, THOUGH THE ACTUAL BENEFITS (IF ANY) WILL DEPEND ON THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK PRICE AND STOCK OPTION EXERCISE PATTERNS.  \u2022  THE ACTUAL MIX OF EARNINGS BY JURISDICTION COULD FLUCTUATE FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S PROJECTION.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  THE TAX EFFECTS OF OTHER DISCRETE ITEMS, INCLUDING ACCRUALS RELATED TO TAX CONTINGENCIES, THE RESOLUTION OF WORLDWIDE TAX MATTERS, TAX AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS EXPIRATIONS AND CHANGES IN TAX REGULATIONS.  \u2022  ANY FUTURE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES OR POTENTIAL TAX REFORM, THE IMPACT OF FUTURE REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE IMPLEMENTING THE TCJA AND ANY RELATED ADDITIONAL TAX PLANNING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THESE CHANGES.  AS A RESULT OF THE UNCERTAINTY IN PREDICTING THESE ITEMS, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE USED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES WILL CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  FOR THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  , COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  INCREASED  $644 MILLION  AND  INCREASED  $105 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIODS OF  2018  , PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN NET EARNINGS AND CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS IN THE PERIODS.  NET EARNINGS INCREASED  $58 MILLION  IN THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  VERSUS THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD IN 2018, AND NET EARNINGS DECREASED  $175 MILLION  IN THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD IN 2019 VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN 2018.  FOR THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019  , THE COMPANY RECORDED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  LOSS  ES OF  $47 MILLION  AND  $57 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  LOSS  ES OF  $641 MILLION  AND  $347 MILLION  FOR THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 29, 2018  , RESULTING IN A DECREASE IN LOSSES FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS OF  $595 MILLION  AND  $290 MILLION  FOR THE THREE AND SIX-MONTH PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY.  INFLATION  THE EFFECT OF INFLATION ON THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN THE THREE AND  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JUNE 28, 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  MANAGEMENT ASSESSES THE COMPANY\u2019S LIQUIDITY IN TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH TO FUND ITS OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND FORECASTS THAT ITS OPERATING CASH FLOW AND OTHER SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY (INCLUDING THE ANTICIPATED FINANCING FOR THE GE BIOPHARMA ACQUISITION) WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN EXISTING BUSINESSES, CONSUMMATING STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING THE ANTICIPATED GE BIOPHARMA ACQUISITION), PAYING INTEREST AND SERVICING DEBT AND MANAGING ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE ON A SHORT AND LONG-TERM BASIS.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOLLOWING IS AN OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY ($ IN MILLIONS).

OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD AS WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS FOR INCOME TAXES, RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, PENSION FUNDING AND OTHER ITEMS IMPACT REPORTED CASH FLOWS.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS WERE  $1,875 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  2019  ,  AN INCREASE  OF  $10 MILLION  , OR APPROXIMATELY  0.5%  , AS COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  .  THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS FROM  2018  TO  2019  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.  \u2022  2019  OPERATING CASH FLOWS REFLECTED  A DECREASE  OF  $175 MILLION  IN NET EARNINGS FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN  2018  .

AMORTIZATION EXPENSE PRIMARILY RELATES TO THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS AND INCREASED DUE TO RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES.

TOTAL WORKFORCE DECLINED BY 1,208 IN THE QUARTER, MAINLY DIRECT LABOR. INITIATED ACTIONS TO REDUCE INDIRECT HEADCOUNT BY ABOUT 5%. ADDITIONAL RESTRUCTURING MEASURES ARE BEING EVALUATED.  THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED ANOTHER CHALLENGING QUARTER DOMINATED BY SEVERE WEAKNESS IN GLOBAL LIGHT VEHICLE MARKETS AND HIGH RAW MATERIAL COSTS WITH REDUCED PROFITABILITY AS A CONSEQUENCE. THE UNCERTAINTY REMAINS HIGH IN A FALLING MARKET AND THE COMPANY CURRENTLY DOES NOT SEE ANY SIGNS OF A TURNAROUND IN LIGHT VEHICLE DEMAND.

ORDER INTAKE CONTINUED ON A GOOD LEVEL, SECURING A STRONG ORDER BOOK AND A PROLONGED OUTPERFORMANCE COMPARED TO LVP.

THE GROSS MARGIN WAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THE SHARP DECLINE IN GLOBAL LIGHT VEHICLE PRODUCTION RESULTING IN A LOWER UTILIZATION OF  THE COMPAN  Y\u2019S  PRODUCTION ASSETS AND RAW MATERIAL HEADWINDS. THIS WAS OFFSET TO SOME DEGREE BY ORGANIC GROWTH  (  NON-U.S. GAAP MEASURE)  FROM LAUNCHES OF NEW PRODUCTS, WHICH HAVE A LOWER MARGIN CONTRIBUTION IN THE EARLY PHASE OF THE RAMP-UP.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  OF NEGATIVE $9 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WAS $19 MILLION LOWER THAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR, MAINLY DUE TO ACCRUALS IN SECOND QUARTER 2019 RELATING TO FUTURE REDUCTIONS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INDIRECT WORKFORCE AND LOWER GOVERNMENT INCOME IN CHINA.  OPERATING INCOME  DECREASED BY $60 MILLION, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE DECLINE IN GROSS PROFIT AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET.  ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME  (NON-U.S. GAAP MEASURE, SEE RECONCILIATION TABLE BELOW) DECREASED BY $47 MILLION, MAINLY DUE TO THE LOWER GROSS PROFIT.  FINANCIAL AND NON-OPERATING ITEMS, NET  WAS  CLOSE TO UNCHANGED AT $19 MILLION COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  INCOME BEFORE TAXES  DECREASED BY $59 MILLION, MAINLY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE LOWER OPERATING INCOME.  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  OF 27.4% WAS 19.3 PP HIGHER THAN LAST YEAR PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE SECOND QUARTER 2018 WAS POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY THE REVERSAL OF CERTAIN VALUATION ALLOWANCES AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE VEONEER SPIN-OFF.

OF THE $121 MILLION IN ORGANIC GROWTH, ALMOST 60% CAME FROM THE STEERING WHEELS CATEGORY WITH AIRBAGS CONTRIBUTING ALMOST 30% OF THE ORGANIC GROWTH IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS.  SEATBELT SALES  ORGANIC DECLINE (NON-U.S. GAAP MEASURE, SEE RECONCILIATION TABLE ABOVE) OF 3% WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY WEAKER SALES IN EUROPE, BUT ALSO TO A SMALLER DEGREE IN CHINA, PARTLY MITIGATED BY BETTER PERFORMANCE IN NORTH AMERICA, JAPAN AND ASEAN. THE TREND OF HIGHER SALES OF MORE ADVANCED AND HIGHER VALUE-ADDED SEATBELT SYSTEMS CONTINUED, ESPECIALLY IN CHINA AND JAPAN.  26  SALES BY REGION  FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 THE COMPANY GREW ORGANICALLY (NON-U.S. GAAP MEASURE, SEE RECONCILIATION TABLE ABOVE) BY 1.6% AGAINST THE PRIOR CORRESPONDING PERIOD, OUTPERFORMING THE LVP SIGNIFICANTLY WITH 8.5PP DURING THE PERIOD. THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE ORGANIC GROWTH (NON-U.S. GAAP MEASURE) WERE THE AMERICAS AND REST OF ASIA, MAINLY ASEAN AND INDIA, WITH OFFSETTING EFFECTS FROM EUROPE AND CHINA. THE ORGANIC GROWTH (NON-U.S. GAAP MEASURE) IN THE AMERICAS WAS 12%, MAINLY DRIVEN BY HONDA, NISSAN, FCA, TESLA AND GM.  GROWTH IN REST OF ASIA WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY HYUNDAI/KIA IN SOUTH KOREA, SUZUKI AND HONDA IN INDIA AND TOYOTA IN ASEAN.  EUROPE DECLINED ORGANICALLY (NON-U.S. GAAP MEASURE) BY CLOSE TO 6%, IN LINE WITH THE LVP. THE DECLINE IS FROM AN ARRAY OF CUSTOMERS SUCH AS RENAULT, BMW, JLR, DAIMLER AND FORD.  AUGMENTING THE OFFSETTING EFFECTS IS CHINA DECLINING ORGANICALLY (NON-U.S. GAAP MEASURE) BY MORE THAN 3%, A RESULT OF WEAK SALES FROM THE DOMESTIC CHINESE OEMS IN THE REGION, PARTLY MITIGATED BY THE GLOBAL OEMS GROWING CLOSE TO 3% ORGANICALLY. THE COEMS ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A CONTINUED HEADWIND FROM BAOJUN, GREAT WALL AND WULING. THE GROWTH WITH THE GOEMS HAS BEEN MAINLY THROUGH HONDA AND VW.  OVERALL THE COMPANY\u2019S GROWTH WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY STEERING WHEELS (FCA AND GM) AND FRONTAL AIRBAGS (HONDA AND VW).

RISK FACTORS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. WE UNDERTAKE NO DUTY TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS APPEARING IN THIS REPORT EXCEPT AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY LAW.  PROLOGIS, INC. IS A SELF-ADMINISTERED AND SELF-MANAGED REIT AND IS THE SOLE GENERAL PARTNER OF PROLOGIS, L.P. THROUGH WHICH IT HOLDS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS ASSETS. WE OPERATE PROLOGIS, INC. AND PROLOGIS, L.P. AS ONE ENTERPRISE AND, THEREFORE, OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REFERS TO PROLOGIS, INC. AND ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING PROLOGIS, L.P., COLLECTIVELY. WE INVEST IN REAL ESTATE THROUGH WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER ENTITIES THROUGH WHICH WE CO-INVEST WITH PARTNERS AND INVESTORS. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OWNERSHIP IN THE CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES, WHICH MAY BE CONSOLIDATED OR UNCONSOLIDATED BASED ON OUR LEVEL OF CONTROL OF THE ENTITY.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S OVERVIEW  PROLOGIS IS THE GLOBAL LEADER IN LOGISTICS REAL ESTATE WITH A FOCUS ON KEY MARKETS IN 19 COUNTRIES ON FOUR CONTINENTS. WE OWN, MANAGE AND DEVELOP WELL-LOCATED, HIGH-QUALITY LOGISTICS FACILITIES. OUR LOCAL TEAMS ACTIVELY MANAGE OUR PORTFOLIO, WHICH ENCOMPASSES LEASING AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT, CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT AND OPPORTUNISTIC DISPOSITIONS ALLOWING US TO RECYCLE CAPITAL TO SELF-FUND OUR DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES. THE MAJORITY OF OUR PROPERTIES IN THE U.S. ARE WHOLLY OWNED, WHILE OUR PROPERTIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. ARE GENERALLY HELD IN CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES TO MITIGATE OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS.  OUR IRREPLACEABLE PORTFOLIO IS FOCUSED ON THE WORLD\u2019S MOST VIBRANT MARKETS WHERE CONSUMPTION AND SUPPLY CHAIN RECONFIGURATION DRIVE LOGISTICS DEMAND. IN THE DEVELOPED MARKETS OF THE U.S., EUROPE AND JAPAN, KEY DEMAND DRIVERS INCLUDE THE RECONFIGURATION OF SUPPLY CHAINS (STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY E-COMMERCE TRENDS), THE DEMAND FOR SUSTAINABLE DESIGN FEATURES AND THE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES THAT CAN BE REALIZED FROM HIGH-QUALITY LOGISTICS FACILITIES. IN EMERGING MARKETS, SUCH AS BRAZIL, CHINA AND MEXICO, GROWING AFFLUENCE AND THE RISE OF A NEW CONSUMER CLASS HAVE INCREASED THE NEED FOR MODERN DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS. OUR STRATEGY IS TO OWN THE HIGHEST-QUALITY LOGISTICS PROPERTY PORTFOLIO IN EACH OF OUR TARGET MARKETS. THESE MARKETS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT FOR THE CONSUMPTION SIDE OF A LOGISTICS SUPPLY CHAIN  \u2014 LARGE POPULATION CENTERS WITH PROXIMITY TO LABOR POOLS, SURROUNDED BY HIGHWAYS, RAIL SERVICE OR PORTS. CUSTOMERS TURN TO US BECAUSE THEY KNOW AN EFFICIENT SUPPLY CHAIN WILL MAKE THEIR BUSINESSES SUCCEED, AND THAT A STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP WITH PROLOGIS WILL CREATE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.  WE OPERATE AND MANAGE OUR BUSINESS ON AN OWNED AND MANAGED (\u201cO&M\u201d) BASIS AND THEREFORE EVALUATE THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPERTIES FOR OUR O&M PORTFOLIO, WHICH INCLUDES OUR CONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES AND PROPERTIES OWNED BY OUR UNCONSOLIDATED CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES. WE MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON OUR TOTAL O&M PORTFOLIO AT 100%, AS WE MANAGE THESE PROPERTIES REGARDLESS OF OWNERSHIP. WE ALSO EVALUATE OUR OPERATING RESULTS BASED ON OUR PROPORTIONATE ECONOMIC OWNERSHIP OF EACH PROPERTY INCLUDED IN THE O&M PORTFOLIO (\u201cOUR SHARE\u201d) AS IT REPRESENTS THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OUR O&M PORTFOLIO.  AT JUNE 30, 2019, OUR TOTAL O&M PORTFOLIO AT 100%, INCLUDING PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS (BASED ON GROSS BOOK VALUE AND TOTAL EXPECTED INVESTMENT (\u201cTEI\u201d), TOTALED $71.0 BILLION ACROSS 786 MILLION SQUARE FEET (73 MILLION SQUARE METERS) AND FOUR CONTINENTS. OUR SHARE OF THE TOTAL O&M PORTFOLIO WAS $42.6 BILLION. WE LEASE MODERN LOGISTICS FACILITIES TO A DIVERSE BASE OF APPROXIMATELY 5,100 CUSTOMERS.  30  OUR BUSINESS COMPRISES TWO OPERATING SEGMENTS: REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC CAPITAL.  BELOW IS INFORMATION SUMMARIZING CONSOLIDATED ACTIVITY WITHIN OUR SEGMENTS (IN MILLIONS).  (1)  NET OPERATING INCOME (\u201cNOI\u201d) IS A NON-U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE (\u201cGAAP\u201d) FINANCIAL MEASURE. NOI FROM REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS IS CALCULATED DIRECTLY FROM OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS  RENTAL REVENUES  AND  DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT AND OTHER REVENUES  LESS  RENTAL EXPENSES  AND  OTHER EXPENSES.  SEE THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION FOR A RECONCILIATION OF NOI TO  OPERATING INCOME,  THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE.  (2)  A DEVELOPED PROPERTY MOVES INTO THE OPERATING PORTFOLIO WHEN IT MEETS OUR DEFINITION OF STABILIZATION, WHICH IS THE EARLIER OF ONE YEAR AFTER COMPLETION OR REACHING 90% OCCUPANCY. AMOUNTS REPRESENT OUR TEI, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF THE ESTIMATED COST OF DEVELOPMENT OR EXPANSION, INCLUDING LAND, CONSTRUCTION AND LEASING COSTS.  REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS  RENTAL.  RENTAL OPERATIONS COMPRISE THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GENERALLY CONTRIBUTE 85% TO 90% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES, EARNINGS AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cFFO\u201d). FFO IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE. SEE BELOW FOR A RECONCILIATION OF  NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS  IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME TO OUR FFO MEASURE. WE COLLECT RENT FROM OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH LONG-TERM OPERATING LEASES, INCLUDING REIMBURSEMENTS FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR PROPERTY OPERATING COSTS. WE EXPECT TO GENERATE LONG-TERM INTERNAL GROWTH BY INCREASING RENTS, MAINTAINING HIGH OCCUPANCY RATES AND CONTROLLING EXPENSES. THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF OUR REVENUE GROWTH WILL BE ROLLING IN-PLACE LEASES TO CURRENT MARKET RENTS COUPLED WITH INCREASING MARKET RENTS. WE BELIEVE OUR ACTIVE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, COMBINED WITH THE SKILLS OF OUR PROPERTY, LEASING, MAINTENANCE, CAPITAL, ENERGY, SUSTAINABILITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT TEAMS, WILL ALLOW US TO MAXIMIZE RENTAL REVENUE ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR RENTAL REVENUE, NOI AND CASH FLOWS ARE GENERATED IN THE U.S.  DEVELOPMENT.  WE DEVELOP PROPERTIES TO MEET OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 NEEDS, DEEPEN OUR MARKET PRESENCE AND REFRESH OUR PORTFOLIO QUALITY. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE DUE TO (I) THE STRATEGIC LOCATIONS OF OUR LAND BANK; (II) THE DEVELOPMENT EXPERTISE OF OUR LOCAL TEAMS; AND (III) THE DEPTH OF OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT EFFORTS PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT EARNINGS GROWTH AS PROJECTS LEASE UP AND GENERATE INCOME AND INCREASE THE NET ASSET VALUE OF OUR REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS SEGMENT. BASED ON OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES, OUR CONSOLIDATED LAND BANK, EXCLUDING LAND WE HAVE UNDER OPTION CONTRACTS, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF $7.4 BILLION OF TEI OF NEW LOGISTICS SPACE. GENERALLY, WE DEVELOP PROPERTIES IN THE U.S. FOR LONG-TERM HOLD AND OUTSIDE THE U.S. FOR CONTRIBUTION TO OUR UNCONSOLIDATED CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES.  STRATEGIC CAPITAL  REAL ESTATE IS A CAPITAL-INTENSIVE BUSINESS THAT REQUIRES NEW CAPITAL TO GROW. OUR STRATEGIC CAPITAL BUSINESS GIVES US ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY CAPITAL, BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC, ALLOWING US TO DIVERSIFY OUR SOURCES OF CAPITAL AND PROVIDING US WITH A BROAD RANGE OF OPTIONS TO FUND OUR GROWTH, WHILE REDUCING OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS FOR INVESTMENTS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. WE PARTNER WITH SOME OF THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS TO GROW OUR BUSINESS AND PROVIDE INCREMENTAL REVENUES. WE ALSO ACCESS ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF EQUITY THROUGH TWO PUBLICLY TRADED VEHICLES: NIPPON PROLOGIS REIT, INC. IN JAPAN AND FIBRA PROLOGIS IN MEXICO. WE ALIGN OUR INTERESTS WITH THOSE OF OUR PARTNERS BY HOLDING SIGNIFICANT OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN ALL OF OUR UNCONSOLIDATED CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES (RANGING FROM 15% TO 50%).  THIS SEGMENT PRODUCES STABLE, LONG-TERM CASH FLOWS AND GENERALLY CONTRIBUTES 10% TO 15% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES, EARNINGS AND FFO. WE GENERATE STRATEGIC CAPITAL REVENUES FROM OUR UNCONSOLIDATED CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES, PRINCIPALLY THROUGH ASSET AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SERVICES. GENERALLY, ALL OF THESE REVENUES ARE EARNED FROM LONG-TERM AND OPEN-ENDED VENTURES. WE EARN ADDITIONAL REVENUES BY PROVIDING LEASING, ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT, FINANCING, LEGAL AND DISPOSITION SERVICES. IN CERTAIN VENTURES, WE ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO EARN REVENUES THROUGH INCENTIVE FEES (\u201cPROMOTES\u201d OR \u201cPROMOTE REVENUE\u201d) PERIODICALLY DURING THE LIFE OF A VENTURE OR UPON LIQUIDATION. WE PLAN TO PROFITABLY GROW THIS BUSINESS BY INCREASING OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT IN EXISTING OR NEW VENTURES. MOST OF THE STRATEGIC CAPITAL REVENUES ARE GENERATED OUTSIDE THE U.S. NOI IN THIS SEGMENT IS CALCULATED DIRECTLY FROM OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS  STRATEGIC CAPITAL REVENUES  LESS  STRATEGIC CAPITAL EXPENSES  AND EXCLUDES PROPERTY-RELATED NOI.  31  FUTURE GROWTH  WE BELIEVE THE QUALITY AND SCALE OF OUR GLOBAL PORTFOLIO, THE EXPERTISE OF OUR TEAM, THE DEPTH OF OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND THE STRENGTH OF OUR BALANCE SHEET GIVE US UNIQUE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES TO GROW REVENUES, NOI, EARNINGS, FFO AND CASH FLOWS.  \u2022  RENT GROWTH.  WE EXPECT MARKET RENTS TO CONTINUE TO GROW OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, DRIVEN BY DEMAND FOR THE LOCATION AND QUALITY OF OUR PROPERTIES. DUE TO STRONG MARKET RENT GROWTH OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, OUR IN-PLACE LEASES HAVE CONSIDERABLE UPSIDE POTENTIAL. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR LEASES ARE MORE THAN 15% BELOW CURRENT MARKET RENT ON THE BASIS OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE OWNERSHIP AT JUNE 30, 2019. THEREFORE, EVEN IF MARKET RENTS REMAIN FLAT, A LEASE RENEWAL WILL TRANSLATE INTO INCREASED FUTURE RENTAL INCOME, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR THROUGH THE EARNINGS WE RECOGNIZE FROM OUR UNCONSOLIDATED CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES BASED ON OUR OWNERSHIP. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED POSITIVE RENT CHANGE ON ROLLOVER (COMPARING THE NET EFFECTIVE RENT OF THE NEW LEASE TO THE PRIOR LEASE FOR THE SAME SPACE) EVERY QUARTER SINCE 2013. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL MORE YEARS DUE TO OUR CURRENT IN-PLACE RENTS BEING BELOW MARKET COUPLED WITH INCREASING MARKET RENTS.  \u2022  VALUE CREATION FROM DEVELOPMENT.  A SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROGRAM INVOLVES MAINTAINING CONTROL OF WELL-LOCATED AND ENTITLED LAND. WE BELIEVE THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR LAND BANK IS BELOW ITS CURRENT FAIR VALUE. DUE TO THE STRATEGIC NATURE OF OUR LAND BANK AND DEVELOPMENT EXPERTISE OF OUR TEAMS, WE EXPECT TO REALIZE FUTURE VALUE CREATION AS WE BUILD OUT THE LAND BANK. WE MEASURE THE ESTIMATED DEVELOPMENT VALUE AS THE MARGIN ABOVE OUR ANTICIPATED COST TO DEVELOP. WE CALCULATE THE MARGIN USING ESTIMATED YIELD AND CAPITALIZATION RATES FROM OUR UNDERWRITING MODELS. AS PROPERTIES UNDER DEVELOPMENT STABILIZE, WE EXPECT TO REALIZE THE VALUE CREATION PRINCIPALLY THROUGH CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNCONSOLIDATED CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES AND INCREASES IN THE NOI OF OUR OPERATING PORTFOLIO.  SUMMARY OF 2019  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, OPERATING FUNDAMENTALS REMAINED STRONG FOR OUR O&M PORTFOLIO AND WE ENDED THE PERIOD WITH OCCUPANCY OF 96.8%.  IN 2019, WE COMPLETED THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES AS DESCRIBED IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u2022  IN JANUARY, WE FORMED PROLOGIS BRAZIL LOGISTICS VENTURE (\u201cPBLV\u201d), A BRAZILIAN UNCONSOLIDATED CO-INVESTMENT VENTURE, WITH ONE PARTNER. WE CONTRIBUTED AN INITIAL PORTFOLIO OF REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES TO PBLV CONSISTING OF 14 OPERATING PROPERTIES TOTALING 7 MILLION SQUARE FEET AND 371 ACRES OF LAND. WE RECEIVED TOTAL PROCEEDS OF $620 MILLION, INCLUDING CASH AND UNITS, AND RETAINED A 20% EQUITY INTEREST.  \u2022  EXCLUDING THE CONTRIBUTION TO PBLV, WE  GENERATED NET PROCEEDS OF $921 MILLION AND REALIZED NET GAINS OF $270 MILLION, PRIMARILY FROM THE CONTRIBUTION OF PROPERTIES TO OUR UNCONSOLIDATED CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES IN JAPAN AND EUROPE IN THE SECOND QUARTER.  \u2022  IN FEBRUARY, WE REDEEMED A PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENT IN PROLOGIS EUROPEAN LOGISTICS FUND (\u201cPELF\u201d) FOR PROCEEDS OF \u20ac278 MILLION  ($313 MILLION).  \u2022  WE COMPLETED THE FOLLOWING FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  \u2022  WE UPSIZED OUR GLOBAL SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY BY $500 MILLION TO $3.5 BILLION WITH MATURITY IN JANUARY 2023. AT JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD $3.8 BILLION OF AVAILABLE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES.  \u2022  WE ENTERED INTO TWO UNSECURED JAPANESE YEN TERM LOANS FOR A TOTAL OF \u00a515.0 BILLION ($137 MILLION) THAT BEAR INTEREST OF YEN LIBOR PLUS 0.5% TO 0.6% AND ARE SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN JANUARY 2028 AND 2030.  \u2022  WE ENTERED INTO AN UNSECURED JAPANESE YEN TERM LOAN AGREEMENT (THE \u201cMARCH 2019 YEN TERM LOAN\u201d) UNDER WHICH WE CAN DRAW JAPANESE YEN IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED \u00a585.0 BILLION ($789 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2019). THE MARCH  32  2019 YEN TERM LOAN BEARS INTEREST AT YEN LIBOR PLUS 0.  4% AND IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN MARCH 2026. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO INCREASE THE  MARCH  2019 YEN TERM LOAN TO \u00a5120.0 BILLION ($1.1  B  ILLION AT  JUNE  3  0  , 2019), SUBJECT TO OBTAINING ADDITIONAL LENDER COMMITMENTS.  W  E USED THE PROCEEDS F  ROM THE  MARCH  2019 YEN TERM LOAN  PRIMARILY  TO REPAY THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF \u00a5100.0 BILLION ($897 MILLION) ON OUR 2016 JAPANESE YEN TERM LOAN.  \u2022  WE COMPLETED A PRIVATE PLACEMENT FOR \u00a510.0 BILLION ($91 MILLION) OF SENIOR NOTES WITH A STATED INTEREST RATE OF 1.2%, MATURING IN MARCH 2039.  ON JULY 15, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A MERGER AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE THE WHOLLY-OWNED REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY TRUST INC. (\u201cIPT\u201d) FOR APPROXIMATELY $4.0 BILLION IN A CASH TRANSACTION, INCLUDING THE ASSUMPTION AND REPAYMENT OF DEBT. THE TRANSACTION, CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 OR FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, IS SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF IPT STOCKHOLDERS AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. FOLLOWING THE CLOSING, WE INTEND TO HOLD THE PORTFOLIO THROUGH EITHER ONE OR BOTH OF OUR U.S. CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES.  THROUGHOUT THIS DISCUSSION, WE REFLECT AMOUNTS IN U.S. DOLLARS, OUR REPORTING CURRENCY. INCLUDED IN THESE AMOUNTS ARE CONSOLIDATED AND UNCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PRINCIPALLY THE BRITISH POUND STERLING, EURO AND JAPANESE YEN THAT ARE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES WHEN TRANSLATED TO U.S. DOLLARS. WE MITIGATE OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BY INVESTING OUTSIDE THE U.S. THROUGH CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES, BORROWING IN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES AND UTILIZING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018  WE EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS BASED ON THE NOI OF OUR TWO OPERATING SEGMENTS: REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC CAPITAL. NOI BY SEGMENT IS A NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURE THAT IS CALCULATED USING REVENUES AND EXPENSES DIRECTLY FROM OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE CONSIDER NOI BY SEGMENT TO BE AN APPROPRIATE SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE IT HELPS MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS UNDERSTAND OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  BELOW IS A RECONCILIATION OF OUR NOI BY SEGMENT TO  OPERATING INCOME  PER THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30 (IN MILLIONS). EACH SEGMENT\u2019S NOI IS RECONCILED TO THE RESPECTIVE LINE ITEMS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE RESPECTIVE SEGMENT DISCUSSION BELOW.  2019  2018  REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS \u2013 NOI  $1,023  $822  STRATEGIC CAPITAL \u2013 NOI  88  130  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  (136  )  (120  )  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES  (568  )  (408  )  OPERATING INCOME BEFORE GAINS ON REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS, NET  407  424  GAINS ON REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS, NET  412  290  OPERATING INCOME  $819  $714  SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR SEGMENTS AND A RECONCILIATION OF EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT\u2019S NOI TO  OPERATING INCOME  AND  EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES.  REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS  THIS OPERATING SEGMENT PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES RENTAL REVENUE AND RENTAL EXPENSES RECOGNIZED FROM OUR CONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES. WE ALLOCATE THE COSTS OF OUR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND LEASING FUNCTIONS TO THE REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS SEGMENT THROUGH  RENTAL EXPENSES  AND THE STRATEGIC CAPITAL SEGMENT THROUGH  STRATEGIC CAPITAL EXPENSES  BASED ON THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE RELATIVE PORTFOLIOS. THE OPERATING FUNDAMENTALS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE CONTINUE TO BE STRONG, WHICH HAS INCREASED RENTS, KEPT OCCUPANCIES HIGH AND FUELED DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION, THIS SEGMENT IS IMPACTED BY OUR DEVELOPMENT, ACQUISITION AND DISPOSITION ACTIVITIES.  BELOW ARE THE COMPONENTS OF REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS REVENUES, EXPENSES AND NOI FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, DERIVED DIRECTLY FROM LINE ITEMS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IN MILLIONS).  2019  2018  RENTAL REVENUES  (1)  $1,397  $1,100  DEVELOPMENT MANAGEMENT AND OTHER REVENUES  2  6  RENTAL EXPENSES  (369  )  (276  )  OTHER EXPENSES  (7  )  (8  )  REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS \u2013 NOI  $1,023  $822  (1)  AS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, UNDER THE NEW LEASE STANDARD, WE ADOPTED THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT TO  PRESENT RENTAL REVENUE AND RENTAL RECOVERIES AS A SINGLE COMPONENT UNDER  RENTAL REVENUES  IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  33  THE CHANGE IN REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS NOI  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018,  WAS IMPACTED BY THE FOLLOWING ITEMS (IN MILLIONS).  (1)  ACQUISITION ACTIVITY INCREASED NOI IN 2019, COMPARED TO 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF DCT INDUSTRIAL TRUST INC. AND DCT INDUSTRIAL OPERATING PARTNERSHIP LP (COLLECTIVELY \u201cDCT\u201d), WHICH WAS COMPLETED FOR $8.5 BILLION ON AUGUST 22, 2018 (\u201cDCT TRANSACTION\u201d).  (2)  DURING BOTH PERIODS, WE EXPERIENCED POSITIVE RENT RATE GROWTH. RENT RATE GROWTH (OR RENT CHANGE) IS A COMBINATION OF THE ROLLOVER OF EXISTING LEASES AND INCREASES IN CERTAIN RENTAL RATES FROM CONTRACTUAL RENT INCREASES ON EXISTING LEASES. IF A LEASE HAS A CONTRACTUAL RENT INCREASE THAT IS NOT KNOWN AT THE TIME THE LEASE COMMENCES, SUCH AS THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX OR A SIMILAR METRIC, THE RENT INCREASE IS NOT INCLUDED IN RENT LEVELING AND THEREFORE, IMPACTS THE RENTAL REVENUE WE RECOGNIZE. SEE BELOW FOR KEY METRICS ON OCCUPANCY AND RENT CHANGE ON ROLLOVER FOR THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PORTFOLIO.  (3)  WE CALCULATE CHANGES IN NOI FROM DEVELOPMENT COMPLETIONS PERIOD OVER PERIOD BY COMPARING THE CHANGE IN NOI GENERATED ON THE POOL OF DEVELOPMENTS THAT WERE COMPLETED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2018 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2019.  (  4  )  OTHER ITEMS INCLUDE INTERNAL COSTS RELATED TO LEASING ACTIVITIES, EXPENSE RECOVERIES, NON-RECOVERABLE EXPENSES AND CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  BELOW ARE KEY OPERATING METRICS OF OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PORTFOLIO.  (1)  IN AUGUST 2018, WE COMPLETED THE DCT TRANSACTION AND ACQUIRED A  PORTFOLIO OF LOGISTICS REAL ESTATE ASSETS.  (2)  CONSOLIDATED SQUARE FEET OF LEASES COMMENCED AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE NET EFFECTIVE RENT CHANGE WERE CALCULATED FOR LEASES WITH INITIAL TERMS OF ONE YEAR OR GREATER.

STRATEGIC CAPITAL  THIS OPERATING SEGMENT INCLUDES REVENUES FROM ASSET AND PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES FOR SERVICES PERFORMED, AS WELL AS PROMOTE REVENUE EARNED FROM THE UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES. REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRATEGIC CAPITAL SEGMENT FLUCTUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES OWNED BY THE VENTURES, TRANSACTIONAL ACTIVITY INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND THE TIMING OF PROMOTES. THESE REVENUES ARE REDUCED BY THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ASSET AND PROPERTY-LEVEL MANAGEMENT EXPENSES WE INCUR IN MANAGING THE PROPERTIES OWNED BY THESE VENTURES. WE ALLOCATE THE COSTS OF OUR PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND LEASING FUNCTIONS TO THE STRATEGIC CAPITAL SEGMENT THROUGH  STRATEGIC CAPITAL EXPENSES  AND TO THE REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS SEGMENT THROUGH  RENTAL EXPENSES  BASED ON THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE RELATIVE PORTFOLIOS.  35  BELOW ARE THE COMPONENTS OF STRATEGIC CAPITAL REVENUES, EXPENSES AND NOI  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE  3  0  , DERIVED DIRECTLY FROM THE LINE ITEMS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (IN MILLIONS).  2019  2018  STRATEGIC CAPITAL REVENUES  $163  $209  STRATEGIC CAPITAL EXPENSES  (75  )  (79  )  STRATEGIC CAPITAL \u2013 NOI  $88  $130  BELOW IS ADDITIONAL DETAIL OF OUR STRATEGIC CAPITAL REVENUES, EXPENSES AND NOI FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30 (IN MILLIONS).

OUR O&M OPERATING PORTFOLIO  WE MANAGE OUR BUSINESS AND REVIEW OUR OPERATING FUNDAMENTALS ON AN O&M BASIS, WHICH INCLUDES CONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES AND PROPERTIES OWNED OUR UNCONSOLIDATED CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES. WE BELIEVE REVIEWING THESE FUNDAMENTALS THIS WAY ALLOWS MANAGEMENT TO UNDERSTAND THE ENTIRE IMPACT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS IT WILL AFFECT BOTH THE REAL ESTATE OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC CAPITAL SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS THE NET EARNINGS WE RECOGNIZE FROM OUR UNCONSOLIDATED CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES BASED ON OUR OWNERSHIP. WE DO NOT CONTROL THE UNCONSOLIDATED CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES FOR PURPOSES OF GAAP AND THE PRESENTATION OF THE VENTURES\u2019 OPERATING INFORMATION DOES NOT REPRESENT A LEGAL CLAIM.  37  OUR  O&M  OPERATING PORTFOLIO DOES NOT INCLUDE OUR DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO, VALUE-ADDED PROPERTIES  , NON-INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES  OR PROPERTIES HELD FOR SALE TO THIRD PARTIES.

SAME STORE ANALYSIS  OUR SAME STORE METRICS ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, WHICH ARE COMMONLY USED IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY AND EXPECTED FROM THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY, ON BOTH A NET EFFECTIVE AND CASH BASIS. WE EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OPERATING PROPERTIES WE OWN AND MANAGE USING A \u201cSAME STORE\u201d ANALYSIS BECAUSE THE POPULATION OF PROPERTIES IN THIS ANALYSIS IS CONSISTENT FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, WHICH ALLOWS US AND INVESTORS TO ANALYZE OUR ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS. WE DETERMINE OUR SAME STORE METRICS ON PROPERTY NOI, WHICH IS CALCULATED AS RENTAL REVENUE LESS RENTAL EXPENSE FOR THE APPLICABLE PROPERTIES IN THE SAME STORE POPULATION FOR BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND UNCONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES BASED ON OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST, AS FURTHER DEFINED BELOW.  WE DEFINE OUR SAME STORE POPULATION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS THE PROPERTIES IN OUR O&M OPERATING PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THE PROPERTY NOI FOR BOTH CONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES AND PROPERTIES OWNED BY THE UNCONSOLIDATED CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES AT JANUARY 1, 2018 AND OWNED THROUGHOUT THE SAME THREE-MONTH PERIOD IN BOTH 2018 AND 2019. WE BELIEVE THE DRIVERS OF PROPERTY NOI FOR THE CONSOLIDATED PORTFOLIO ARE GENERALLY THE SAME FOR THE PROPERTIES OWNED BY THE VENTURES IN WHICH WE INVEST AND THEREFORE WE EVALUATE THE SAME STORE METRICS OF THE O&M PORTFOLIO BASED ON PROLOGIS\u2019 OWNERSHIP IN THE PROPERTIES (\u201cPROLOGIS SHARE\u201d). THE SAME STORE POPULATION EXCLUDES PROPERTIES HELD FOR SALE TO THIRD PARTIES, ALONG WITH DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES THAT WERE NOT STABILIZED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD (JANUARY 1, 2018) AND PROPERTIES ACQUIRED OR DISPOSED OF TO THIRD PARTIES DURING THE PERIOD. TO DERIVE AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF PERIOD-TO-PERIOD OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WE REMOVE THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS BY USING THE REPORTED PERIOD-END EXCHANGE RATE TO TRANSLATE FROM LOCAL CURRENCY INTO THE U.S. DOLLAR, FOR BOTH PERIODS.  38  AS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, THE SAME STORE METRICS HAVE CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL AND MAY VARY AMONG REAL ESTATE COMPANIES.

NET TERMINATION AND RENEGOTIATION FEES REPRESENT THE GROSS FEE NEGOTIATED TO ALLOW A CUSTOMER TO TERMINATE OR RENEGOTIATE THEIR LEASE, OFFSET BY THE WRITE-OFF OF THE ASSET RECORDED DUE TO THE ADJUSTMENT TO STRAIGHT-LINE RENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. SAME STORE PROPERTY NOI IS ADJUSTED TO INCLUDE AN ALLOCATION OF PROPERTY MANAGEMENT EXPENSES FOR OUR CONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES BASED ON THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SERVICES PROVIDED TO EACH PROPERTY (GENERALLY, BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES). ON CONSOLIDATION, THESE AMOUNTS ARE ELIMINATED AND THE ACTUAL COSTS OF PROVIDING PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS PART OF OUR CONSOLIDATED RENTAL EXPENSE.  (2)  WE INCLUDE THE PROPERTY NOI FOR THE SAME STORE PORTFOLIO FOR BOTH CONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES AND PROPERTIES OWNED BY THE CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES BASED ON OUR INVESTMENT IN THE UNDERLYING PROPERTIES. IN ORDER TO CALCULATE OUR SHARE OF SAME STORE PROPERTY NOI FROM THE CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES IN WHICH WE OWN LESS THAN 100%, WE USE THE CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES\u2019 UNDERLYING PROPERTY NOI FOR THE SAME STORE PORTFOLIO AND APPLY OUR OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE AT JUNE 30, 2019 TO THE PROPERTY NOI FOR BOTH PERIODS, INCLUDING THE PROPERTIES CONTRIBUTED DURING THE PERIOD. WE ADJUST THE TOTAL PROPERTY NOI FROM THE SAME STORE PORTFOLIO OF THE CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES BY SUBTRACTING THE THIRD PARTIES\u2019 SHARE OF BOTH CONSOLIDATED AND UNCONSOLIDATED CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES.  DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED, CERTAIN WHOLLY OWNED PROPERTIES WERE CONTRIBUTED TO A CO-INVESTMENT VENTURE AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE SAME STORE PORTFOLIO. NEITHER OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS NOR THOSE OF THE CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES, WHEN VIEWED INDIVIDUALLY, WOULD BE COMPARABLE ON A SAME STORE BASIS BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES IN COMPOSITION OF THE RESPECTIVE PORTFOLIOS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD (E.G. THE RESULTS OF A CONTRIBUTED PROPERTY ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS THROUGH THE CONTRIBUTION DATE AND IN THE RESULTS OF THE VENTURE SUBSEQUENT TO THE CONTRIBUTION DATE BASED ON OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST AT THE END OF THE PERIOD). AS A RESULT, ONLY LINE ITEMS LABELED \u201cPROLOGIS SHARE OF SAME STORE PROPERTY NOI\u201d ARE COMPARABLE PERIOD OVER PERIOD.  (3)  WE FURTHER REMOVE CERTAIN NONCASH ITEMS (STRAIGHT-LINE RENT AND AMORTIZATION OF FAIR VALUE LEASE ADJUSTMENTS) INCLUDED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP TO REFLECT A SAME STORE PROPERTY NOI \u2013 CASH MEASURE.  WE MANAGE OUR BUSINESS AND COMPENSATE OUR EXECUTIVES BASED ON THE SAME STORE RESULTS OF OUR O&M PORTFOLIO AT 100% AS WE MANAGE OUR PORTFOLIO ON AN OWNERSHIP BLIND BASIS. WE CALCULATE THOSE RESULTS BY INCLUDING 100% OF THE PROPERTIES INCLUDED IN OUR SAME STORE PORTFOLIO.

LOAN-TO-VALUE, A NON-GAAP MEASURE, WAS CALCULATED AS THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL THIRD-PARTY DEBT TO THE GROSS BOOK VALUE OF REAL ESTATE FOR EACH VENTURE AND WEIGHTED BASED ON THE CUMULATIVE GROSS BOOK VALUE OF ALL UNCONSOLIDATED CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES.  AT JUNE 30, 2019, WE DID NOT GUARANTEE ANY THIRD-PARTY DEBT OF THE UNCONSOLIDATED CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  DIVIDEND AND DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS  OUR DIVIDEND POLICY ON OUR COMMON STOCK IS TO DISTRIBUTE A PERCENTAGE OF OUR CASH FLOW TO ENSURE THAT WE WILL MEET THE DIVIDEND REQUIREMENTS OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (\u201cIRC\u201d), RELATIVE TO MAINTAINING OUR REIT STATUS, WHILE STILL ALLOWING US TO RETAIN CASH TO FUND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES.  44  UNDER THE  IRC  , REITS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME AND EXCISE TAXES ON OUR UNDISTRIBUTED TAXABLE INCOME.  WE PAID A CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.53 PER COMMON SHARE IN THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS OF 2019. OUR FUTURE COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS, IF AND AS DECLARED, MAY VARY AND WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (\u201cBOARD\u201d) UPON THE CIRCUMSTANCES PREVAILING AT THE TIME, INCLUDING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND REIT DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS, AND MAY BE ADJUSTED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE BOARD DURING THE YEAR.  WE MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE COMMON LIMITED PARTNERSHIP UNITS OUTSTANDING AT THE SAME PER UNIT AMOUNT AS OUR COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND. THE CLASS A UNITS IN PROLOGIS, L.P. ARE ENTITLED TO A QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTION EQUAL TO $0.64665 PER UNIT SO LONG AS THE COMMON UNITS RECEIVE A QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTION OF AT LEAST $0.40 PER UNIT. WE PAID A QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTION OF $0.64665 PER CLASS A UNIT IN THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS OF 2019.  AT JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD ONE SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK OUTSTANDING, THE SERIES Q. THE ANNUAL DIVIDEND RATE IS 8.54% PER SHARE AND DIVIDENDS ARE PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ARREARS.  PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF OUR PREFERRED STOCK, WE ARE RESTRICTED FROM DECLARING OR PAYING ANY DIVIDEND WITH RESPECT TO OUR COMMON STOCK UNLESS AND UNTIL ALL CUMULATIVE DIVIDENDS WITH RESPECT TO THE PREFERRED STOCK HAVE BEEN PAID AND SUFFICIENT FUNDS HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE FOR DIVIDENDS THAT HAVE BEEN DECLARED FOR THE RELEVANT DIVIDEND PERIOD WITH RESPECT TO THE PREFERRED STOCK.  OTHER COMMITMENTS  ON A CONTINUING BASIS, WE ARE ENGAGED IN VARIOUS STAGES OF NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES OR PORTFOLIOS OF PROPERTIES, INCLUDING THE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED ACQUISITION OF IPT.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS/UNITHOLDERS (\u201cFFO\u201d)  FFO IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT IS COMMONLY USED IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY. THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO FFO IS NET EARNINGS.  THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\u201cNAREIT\u201d) DEFINES FFO AS EARNINGS COMPUTED UNDER GAAP TO EXCLUDE HISTORICAL COST DEPRECIATION AND GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE SALES, ALONG WITH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, OF PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED PROPERTIES. WE ALSO EXCLUDE THE GAINS ON REVALUATION OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS UPON ACQUISITION OF A CONTROLLING INTEREST AND THE GAIN RECOGNIZED FROM A PARTIAL SALE OF OUR INVESTMENT, AS THESE ARE SIMILAR TO GAINS FROM THE SALES OF PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED PROPERTIES. WE EXCLUDE SIMILAR ADJUSTMENTS FROM OUR UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES AND THE THIRD PARTIES\u2019 SHARE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED CO-INVESTMENT VENTURES.  OUR FFO MEASURES  OUR FFO MEASURES BEGIN WITH NAREIT\u2019S DEFINITION AND WE MAKE CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT OUR BUSINESS AND THE WAY THAT MANAGEMENT PLANS AND EXECUTES OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. WHILE NOT INFREQUENT OR UNUSUAL, THE ADDITIONAL ITEMS WE ADJUST FOR IN CALCULATING  FFO, AS MODIFIED BY PROLOGIS  AND  CORE FFO  , BOTH AS DEFINED BELOW, ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. ALTHOUGH THESE ITEMS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND ARE REFLECTED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE REMOVAL OF THE EFFECTS OF THESE ITEMS ALLOWS US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPERTIES OVER THE LONG TERM. THESE ITEMS HAVE BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN INCONSISTENT AND UNPREDICTABLE DIRECTIONS THAT ARE NOT RELEVANT TO OUR LONG-TERM OUTLOOK.  WE CALCULATE OUR FFO MEASURES, AS DEFINED BELOW, BASED ON OUR PROPORTIONATE OWNERSHIP SHARE OF BOTH OUR UNCONSOLIDATED AND CONSOLIDATED VENTURES. WE REFLECT OUR SHARE OF OUR FFO MEASURES FOR UNCONSOLIDATED VENTURES BY APPLYING OUR AVERAGE OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE FOR THE PERIOD TO THE APPLICABLE RECONCILING ITEMS ON AN ENTITY BY ENTITY BASIS. WE REFLECT OUR SHARE FOR CONSOLIDATED VENTURES IN WHICH WE DO NOT OWN 100% OF THE EQUITY BY ADJUSTING OUR FFO MEASURES TO REMOVE THE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS SHARE OF THE APPLICABLE RECONCILING ITEMS BASED ON OUR AVERAGE OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE FOR THE APPLICABLE PERIODS.  THESE FFO MEASURES ARE USED BY MANAGEMENT AS SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL MEASURES OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT STOCKHOLDERS, POTENTIAL INVESTORS AND FINANCIAL ANALYSTS UNDERSTAND THE MEASURES MANAGEMENT USES. WE DO NOT USE OUR FFO MEASURES AS, NOR SHOULD THEY BE CONSIDERED TO BE, ALTERNATIVES TO NET EARNINGS COMPUTED UNDER GAAP, AS INDICATORS OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AS ALTERNATIVES TO CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES COMPUTED UNDER GAAP OR AS INDICATORS OF OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR CASH NEEDS.  WE ANALYZE OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE PRINCIPALLY BY THE RENTAL REVENUE OF OUR REAL ESTATE AND THE REVENUES FROM OUR STRATEGIC CAPITAL BUSINESS, NET OF OPERATING, ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCING EXPENSES. THIS INCOME STREAM IS NOT DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE OR DEBT SECURITIES.  45  FFO, AS MODIFIED BY PROLOGIS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS/UNITHOLDERS (\u201cFFO, AS MODIFIED BY PROLOGIS\u201d)  TO ARRIVE AT  FFO, AS MODIFIED BY PROLOGIS  , WE ADJUST THE NAREIT DEFINED FFO MEASURE TO EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RELATED ITEMS AND DEFERRED TAX, SPECIFICALLY.  \u2022  DEFERRED INCOME TAX BENEFITS AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSES RECOGNIZED BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES;  \u2022  CURRENT INCOME TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO ACQUIRED TAX LIABILITIES THAT WERE RECORDED AS DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES IN AN ACQUISITION, TO THE EXTENT THE EXPENSE IS OFFSET WITH A DEFERRED INCOME TAX BENEFIT IN EARNINGS THAT IS EXCLUDED FROM OUR DEFINED FFO MEASURE;  \u2022  UNHEDGED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM DEBT TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN US AND OUR FOREIGN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES AND OUR FOREIGN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES;  \u2022  FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE REMEASUREMENT (BASED ON CURRENT FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES) OF CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY DEBT OF OUR FOREIGN CONSOLIDATED AND UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES; AND  \u2022  MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  WE USE  FFO, AS MODIFIED BY PROLOGIS  , SO THAT MANAGEMENT, ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS ARE ABLE TO EVALUATE OUR PERFORMANCE AGAINST OTHER REITS THAT DO NOT HAVE SIMILAR OPERATIONS OR OPERATIONS IN JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S.  CORE FFO ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS/UNITHOLDERS (\u201cCORE FFO\u201d)  IN ADDITION TO  FFO, AS MODIFIED BY PROLOGIS  , WE ALSO USE  CORE FFO.  TO ARRIVE AT  CORE FFO,  WE ADJUST  FFO, AS MODIFIED BY PROLOGIS  , TO EXCLUDE THE FOLLOWING RECURRING AND NONRECURRING ITEMS THAT WE RECOGNIZED DIRECTLY IN  FFO, AS MODIFIED BY PROLOGIS  .  \u2022  GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THE DISPOSITION OF LAND AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES THAT WERE DEVELOPED WITH THE INTENT TO CONTRIBUTE OR SELL;  \u2022  INCOME TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE;  \u2022  IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECOGNIZED RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE GENERALLY AS A RESULT OF OUR CHANGE IN INTENT TO CONTRIBUTE OR SELL THESE PROPERTIES;  \u2022  GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THE EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT AND REDEMPTION AND REPURCHASE OF PREFERRED STOCK; AND  \u2022  EXPENSES RELATED TO NATURAL DISASTERS.  WE USE  CORE FFO  , INCLUDING BY SEGMENT AND REGION, TO: (I) ASSESS OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AS COMPARED TO OTHER REAL ESTATE COMPANIES; (II) EVALUATE OUR PERFORMANCE AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPERTIES IN COMPARISON WITH EXPECTED RESULTS AND RESULTS OF PREVIOUS PERIODS; (III) EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR MANAGEMENT; (IV) BUDGET AND FORECAST FUTURE RESULTS TO ASSIST IN THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES; (V) PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO THE FINANCIAL MARKETS TO UNDERSTAND OUR EXPECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE; AND (VI) EVALUATE HOW A SPECIFIC POTENTIAL INVESTMENT WILL IMPACT OUR FUTURE RESULTS.  LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF OUR FFO MEASURES  WHILE WE BELIEVE OUR MODIFIED FFO MEASURES ARE IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES, NEITHER NAREIT\u2019S NOR OUR MEASURES OF FFO SHOULD BE USED ALONE BECAUSE THEY EXCLUDE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC COMPONENTS OF NET EARNINGS COMPUTED UNDER GAAP AND ARE, THEREFORE, LIMITED AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL. ACCORDINGLY, THESE ARE ONLY A FEW OF THE MANY MEASURES WE USE WHEN ANALYZING OUR BUSINESS. SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS ARE.  \u2022  THE CURRENT INCOME TAX EXPENSES THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM OUR MODIFIED FFO MEASURES REPRESENT THE TAXES AND TRANSACTION COSTS THAT ARE PAYABLE.  \u2022  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS ARE ECONOMIC COSTS THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM FFO. FFO IS LIMITED, AS IT DOES NOT REFLECT THE CASH REQUIREMENTS THAT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR FUTURE REPLACEMENTS OF THE REAL ESTATE ASSETS. FURTHERMORE, THE AMORTIZATION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASING COSTS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF LOGISTICS FACILITIES ARE NOT REFLECTED IN FFO.  \u2022  GAINS OR LOSSES FROM NON-DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO EXPECTED DISPOSITIONS REPRESENT CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES. BY EXCLUDING THESE GAINS AND LOSSES, FFO DOES NOT CAPTURE REALIZED CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF DISPOSED PROPERTIES ARISING FROM CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS.  \u2022  THE DEFERRED INCOME TAX BENEFITS AND EXPENSES THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM OUR MODIFIED FFO MEASURES RESULT FROM THE CREATION OF A DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSET OR LIABILITY THAT MAY HAVE TO BE SETTLED AT SOME FUTURE POINT. OUR MODIFIED FFO MEASURES DO NOT CURRENTLY REFLECT ANY INCOME OR EXPENSE THAT MAY RESULT FROM SUCH SETTLEMENT.  46  \u2022  THE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM OUR MODIFIED FFO MEASURES ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED BASED ON MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES THROUGH A SPECIFIC POINT IN TIME. THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED NET ASSETS IS INDEFINITE AS TO TIMING AND AMOUNT. OUR FFO MEASURES ARE LIMITED IN THAT THEY DO NOT REFLECT THE CURRENT PERIOD CHANGES IN THESE NET ASSETS THAT RESULT FROM PERIODIC FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS.  \u2022  THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OR PREFERRED STOCK THAT WE EXCLUDE FROM OUR CORE FFO, MAY PROVIDE A BENEFIT OR COST TO US AS WE MAY BE SETTLING OUR OBLIGATION AT LESS OR MORE THAN OUR FUTURE OBLIGATION.  \u2022  THE NATURAL DISASTER EXPENSES THAT WE EXCLUDE FROM CORE FFO ARE COSTS THAT WE HAVE INCURRED.  WE COMPENSATE FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY USING OUR FFO MEASURES ONLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH NET EARNINGS COMPUTED UNDER GAAP WHEN MAKING OUR DECISIONS. THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ WITH OUR COMPLETE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED UNDER GAAP. TO ASSIST INVESTORS IN COMPENSATING FOR THESE LIMITATIONS, WE RECONCILE OUR MODIFIED FFO MEASURES TO OUR NET EARNINGS COMPUTED UNDER GAAP FOR SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30 AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).  2019  2018  RECONCILIATION OF NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS TO FFO MEASURES.

OUR CALCULATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY DIFFER FROM THE CALCULATIONS OF SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES BY OTHER COMPANIES.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BANK HOLDING COMPANY  AMERICAN EXPRESS IS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956 AND THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE) IS OUR PRIMARY FEDERAL REGULATOR. AS SUCH, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE\u2019S REGULATIONS, POLICIES AND MINIMUM CAPITAL STANDARDS.  BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT  OUR RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER REFLECT SOLID PERFORMANCE THAT CONTINUES TO DEMONSTRATE BROAD BASED GROWTH ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIES. WE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN NEW SERVICES AND CARD MEMBER BENEFITS, NEW CARD ACQUISITIONS AND EXPANDING OUR MERCHANT NETWORK, WHILE CONTINUING TO RETURN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS INCREASED 5 PERCENT OVER THE PRIOR YEAR AND WORLDWIDE PROPRIETARY BILLINGS, WHICH COMPRISES 86% OF OUR TOTAL BILLINGS, GREW 7 PERCENT LED BY CONSUMERS. THE US DOLLAR REMAINED STRONG, RELATIVE TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AGAINST MOST MAJOR CURRENCIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, RESULTING IN A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BILLINGS AND REVENUE GROWTH. AFTER ADJUSTING FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE (FX) RATES, WORLDWIDE PROPRIETARY BILLED BUSINESS INCREASED 8 PERCENT OVER THE PRIOR YEAR, WITH INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY BILLINGS CONTINUING DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH.  1  THIS SPENDING IS OCCURRING AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF AN ECONOMY THAT IS GROWING AT A STEADY BUT MORE MODEST PACE RELATIVE TO 2018. GNS BILLED BUSINESS DECLINED AS WE CONTINUE TO EXIT THE NETWORK BUSINESS IN EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA DUE TO CERTAIN REGULATORY CHANGES; EXCLUDING THE BILLINGS FROM THOSE GEOGRAPHIES, GNS BILLED BUSINESS GREW 6 PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR ON AN FX-ADJUSTED BASIS.  1  REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED 8 PERCENT (10 PERCENT ON AN FX-ADJUSTED BASIS), DRIVEN BY A WELL-BALANCED MIX OF GROWTH ACROSS CARD MEMBER SPENDING, LOAN VOLUMES AND CARD FEES.  1  THIS WAS THE EIGHTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER WITH FX-ADJUSTED REVENUE GROWTH OF 8 PERCENT OR BETTER, COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  1  THE INCREASE IN CARD FEES REFLECTS OUR DISCIPLINED APPROACH OF ENHANCING THE VALUE OF OUR PREMIUM PRODUCTS BY ADDING NEW BENEFITS THAT ARE DRIVING HIGHER ENGAGEMENT WITH NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS.  CARD MEMBER LOANS GREW YEAR-OVER-YEAR, AS WE CONTINUED TO EXPAND OUR LENDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND ACQUIRED NEW CARD MEMBERS. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES INCREASED AS A RESULT OF HIGHER CARD MEMBER LOANS AND RECEIVABLES AND A MODEST INCREASE IN NET WRITE-OFF RATES. THIS GROWTH IN PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES WAS BELOW OUR EXPECTATIONS.  SPENDING ON CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT (THE AGGREGATE OF REWARDS, CARD MEMBER SERVICES, AND MARKETING AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES) INCREASED YEAR-OVER-YEAR ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES. INCREASES IN REWARDS AND CARD MEMBER SERVICES REFLECTED THE GROWTH IN PROPRIETARY BILLINGS AND CONTINUED INVESTMENT AND USAGE ACROSS MANY OF OUR PREMIUM TRAVEL-RELATED BENEFITS. MARKETING AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE GREW DUE TO CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN OUR COBRAND PARTNERSHIPS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED RENEWAL OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH DELTA AIR LINES, AND HIGHER CORPORATE CLIENT INCENTIVES, ALTHOUGH THE GROWTH MODERATED COMPARED TO RECENT QUARTERS AS WE HAVE MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED MARKETING SPENDING THIS YEAR RELATIVE TO 2018 WHEN WE LAUNCHED OUR GLOBAL BRAND CAMPAIGN IN THE SECOND QUARTER.  WE CONTINUE TO SEE ATTRACTIVE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES AND PLAN TO INVEST TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM IN ORDER TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH OVER THE MODERATE TO LONG TERM. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO SEE SOME HEADWINDS IN THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING FROM REGULATION IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AND INTENSE COMPETITION, WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON DELIVERING DIFFERENTIATED VALUE TO OUR MERCHANTS, CARD MEMBERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS AND DELIVERING APPROPRIATE RETURNS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  SEE \u201cCERTAIN LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS\u201d FOR INFORMATION ON CERTAIN MATTERS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  1  THE FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTED INFORMATION ASSUMES A CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN THE PERIODS BEING COMPARED FOR PURPOSES OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION INTO U.S. DOLLARS (I.E., ASSUMES THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES USED TO DETERMINE RESULTS FOR THE CURRENT PERIOD APPLY TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AGAINST WHICH SUCH RESULTS ARE BEING COMPARED). FX-ADJUSTED REVENUES AND EXPENSES CONSTITUTE NON-GAAP MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THE PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION ON A FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTED BASIS IS HELPFUL TO INVESTORS BY MAKING IT EASIER TO COMPARE OUR PERFORMANCE IN ONE PERIOD TO THAT OF ANOTHER PERIOD WITHOUT THE VARIABILITY CAUSED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REFER TO THE \u201cGLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY\u201d FOR THE DEFINITIONS OF CERTAIN KEY TERMS AND RELATED INFORMATION APPEARING WITHIN THIS SECTION.

GMNS MANAGES OUR PARTNERSHIP RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIRD-PARTY CARD ISSUERS, MERCHANT ACQUIRERS AND A PREPAID RELOADABLE AND GIFT CARD PROGRAM MANAGER, LICENSING THE AMERICAN EXPRESS BRAND AND EXTENDING THE REACH OF THE GLOBAL NETWORK. GMNS ALSO MANAGES LOYALTY COALITION BUSINESSES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES.  NON-INTEREST REVENUES INCREASED FOR BOTH THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BILLED BUSINESS GROWTH, PARTIALLY OFFSET IN THE SIX MONTH PERIOD BY LOWER BREAKAGE ON PREPAID PRODUCTS.  NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED FOR BOTH THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS, REFLECTING A HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE CREDIT RELATING TO INTERNAL TRANSFER PRICING, WHICH RESULTS IN A NET BENEFIT FOR GMNS DUE TO ITS MERCHANT PAYABLES.  MARKETING, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, REWARDS AND CARD MEMBER SERVICES EXPENSES INCREASED FOR BOTH THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY MARKETING AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE REFLECTING INCREASED NETWORK ISSUER EXPENSE DUE TO HIGHER U.S. VOLUMES AND PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT WITH OUR PREPAID RELOADABLE AND GIFT CARD PROGRAM MANAGER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER LEVELS OF SPENDING ON GROWTH INITIATIVES.  SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED FOR BOTH THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE PRIOR-YEAR LOSS ON A TRANSACTION INVOLVING THE OPERATIONS OF OUR PREPAID RELOADABLE AND GIFT CARD BUSINESS AND HIGHER TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER SERVICING-RELATED COSTS.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER FOR BOTH THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS, PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN PRIOR YEARS\u2019 TAX ITEMS IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  52  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CORPORATE & OTHER  CORPORATE FUNCTIONS AND CERTAIN OTHER BUSINESSES ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE & OTHER.  CORPORATE & OTHER NET EXPENSE WAS $253 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $254 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO AND $741 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD COMPARED TO $508 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO. THE INCREASE FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A LITIGATION-RELATED CHARGE AND INCREASED TECHNOLOGY COSTS.  53  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  OUR BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES ARE TO MAINTAIN.  \u2022  A SOLID AND FLEXIBLE EQUITY CAPITAL PROFILE;  \u2022  A BROAD, DEEP AND DIVERSE SET OF FUNDING SOURCES TO FINANCE OUR ASSETS AND MEET OPERATING REQUIREMENTS; AND  \u2022  LIQUIDITY PROGRAMS THAT ENABLE US TO CONTINUOUSLY MEET EXPECTED FUTURE FINANCING OBLIGATIONS AND BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST A TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD IN THE EVENT WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO RAISE NEW FUNDS UNDER OUR TRADITIONAL FUNDING PROGRAMS DURING A SUBSTANTIAL WEAKENING IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  CAPITAL  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS AND LEVERAGE RATIOS AND THOSE OF OUR SIGNIFICANT BANK SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS NATIONAL BANK (AENB) AS OF JUNE 30, 2019.

FAILURE TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM CAPITAL LEVELS AT AMERICAN EXPRESS OR AENB COULD AFFECT OUR STATUS AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND CAUSE THE REGULATORY AGENCIES WITH OVERSIGHT OF AMERICAN EXPRESS OR AENB TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT COULD LIMIT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF EQUITY CAPITAL HAS BEEN THE GENERATION OF NET INCOME. CAPITAL GENERATED THROUGH NET INCOME AND OTHER SOURCES, SUCH AS THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS BY EMPLOYEES, IS USED TO MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET, SUPPORT ASSET GROWTH AND ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS, WITH EXCESS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THE PORTION OF GENERATED CAPITAL WE ALLOCATE TO SUPPORT ASSET GROWTH WILL BE GREATER GOING FORWARD THAN IT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY DUE TO PROJECTED ASSET GROWTH.  WE MAINTAIN CERTAIN FLEXIBILITY TO SHIFT CAPITAL ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES AS APPROPRIATE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY INFUSE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INTO SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL AT TARGETED LEVELS IN CONSIDERATION OF DEBT RATINGS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THESE INFUSED AMOUNTS CAN AFFECT THE CAPITAL PROFILE AND LIQUIDITY LEVELS AT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS PARENT COMPANY LEVEL.  THE FOLLOWING ARE DEFINITIONS FOR OUR REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS AND LEVERAGE RATIO, WHICH ARE CALCULATED AS PER STANDARD REGULATORY GUIDANCE.  RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS  \u2014 ASSETS ARE WEIGHTED FOR RISK ACCORDING TO A FORMULA USED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO CONFORM TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES. ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS ARE WEIGHTED FOR RISK, WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS CONVERTED TO BALANCE SHEET EQUIVALENTS, USING RISK CONVERSION FACTORS, BEFORE BEING ALLOCATED A RISK-ADJUSTED WEIGHT. OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES COMPRISE A MINIMAL PART OF THE TOTAL RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.  COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED AS COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL (CET1), DIVIDED BY RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. CET1 IS THE SUM OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY, ADJUSTED FOR INELIGIBLE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ITEMS AS FOLLOWS: NET UNREALIZED GAINS/LOSSES ON SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS AND NET UNREALIZED PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT/LOSSES, ALL NET OF TAX.  TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TIER 1 CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF CET1, OUR PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK AND THIRD-PARTY NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ADJUSTED FOR CAPITAL HELD BY INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FOR THE TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO IS 1.5 PERCENT HIGHER THAN THE MINIMUM FOR THE CET1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO. WE HAVE $1.6 BILLION OF PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING TO HELP ADDRESS A PORTION OF THE TIER 1 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN EXCESS OF COMMON EQUITY REQUIREMENTS.  TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL, DIVIDED BY RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TIER 2 CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND RECEIVABLE LOSSES (LIMITED TO 1.25 PERCENT OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS), MINORITY INTEREST THAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN TIER 1 CAPITAL AND $600 MILLION OF SUBORDINATED NOTES, ADJUSTED FOR CAPITAL HELD BY INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES.  TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED BY DIVIDING TIER 1 CAPITAL BY OUR AVERAGE TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS FOR THE MOST RECENT QUARTER.  SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED BY DIVIDING TIER 1 CAPITAL BY TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE UNDER BASEL III. TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE REFLECTS AVERAGE TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS WITH ADJUSTMENTS FOR TIER 1 CAPITAL DEDUCTIONS, AVERAGE OFF-BALANCE SHEET DERIVATIVE EXPOSURES, AVERAGE SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL, AND AVERAGE CREDIT EQUIVALENTS OF CONDITIONALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY CANCELLABLE UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS.  IN DECEMBER 2018, FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ISSUED A FINAL RULE THAT WOULD PROVIDE AN OPTIONAL THREE-YEAR PHASE-IN PERIOD FOR THE DAY-ONE ADVERSE REGULATORY CAPITAL EFFECTS UPON ADOPTING THE CURRENT EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (CECL) MODEL PURSUANT TO NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR THE RECOGNITION OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020. THE FEDERAL RESERVE ALSO RELEASED A STATEMENT INDICATING THAT IT PLANS TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK FOR CALCULATING CREDIT LOSS ALLOWANCES ON LOANS IN SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTS THROUGH THE 2021 STRESS TEST CYCLE. SEE NOTE 1 TO OUR \u201cCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT CECL.  55  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS  WE RETURN CAPITAL TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. THE SHARE REPURCHASES REDUCE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING AND MORE THAN OFFSET THE ISSUANCE OF NEW SHARES AS PART OF EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS.  DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE RETURNED $0.9 BILLION AND $2.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS OF $0.3 BILLION AND $0.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND SHARE REPURCHASES OF $0.6 BILLION AND $1.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE REPURCHASED 5.5 MILLION COMMON SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $115.59 IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. THESE DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE AMOUNTS COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 52 PERCENT AND 76 PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITAL GENERATED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY.  IN ADDITION, DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE PAID $19 MILLION AND $40 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN DIVIDENDS ON NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING.  WE PLAN TO INCREASE THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON OUR COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING TO $0.43 PER SHARE, FROM $0.39 PER SHARE, BEGINNING WITH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  FUNDING STRATEGY  OUR PRINCIPAL FUNDING OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN BROAD AND WELL-DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES TO ALLOW US TO MEET OUR MATURING OBLIGATIONS, COST-EFFECTIVELY FINANCE CURRENT AND FUTURE ASSET GROWTH IN OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES AS WELL AS TO MAINTAIN A STRONG LIQUIDITY PROFILE.  WE MEET OUR FUNDING NEEDS THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTED DEPOSITS AND DEBT INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT, ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, BORROWINGS THROUGH SECURED BORROWING FACILITIES AND A LONG-TERM COMMITTED BANK BORROWING FACILITY. WHILE WE DIVERSIFY OUR FUNDING SOURCES BY MAINTAINING SCALE AND RELEVANCE IN UNSECURED DEBT, ASSET SECURITIZATIONS AND DEPOSITS, WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THE PERSONAL SAVINGS HIGH YIELD SAVINGS ACCOUNT PROGRAM WILL BECOME A LARGER PROPORTION OF OUR FUNDING OVER TIME.  SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT  WE HAD THE FOLLOWING CONSOLIDATED DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS OUTSTANDING AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018.  TABLE 18: SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS  (BILLIONS)  JUNE 30, 2019  DECEMBER 31, 2018  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS  $2.8  $3.1  LONG-TERM DEBT  57.7  58.4  TOTAL DEBT  60.5  61.5  CUSTOMER DEPOSITS  72.6  70.0  TOTAL DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS  $133.1  $131.5  WE MAY REDEEM FROM TIME TO TIME CERTAIN DEBT SECURITIES WITHIN 31 DAYS PRIOR TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL MATURITY DATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OPTIONAL REDEMPTION PROVISIONS OF THOSE DEBT SECURITIES.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE ISSUED (I) $1.5 BILLION OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES FROM THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT ACCOUNT MASTER TRUST (THE LENDING TRUST) CONSISTING OF $1.5 BILLION OF THREE YEAR CLASS A CERTIFICATES AT A FIXED RATE OF 2.67 PERCENT, AND (II) $3.0 BILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY CONSISTING OF $1.25 BILLION OF THREE YEAR NOTES AT A FIXED RATE OF 2.75 PERCENT, $900 MILLION OF THREE YEAR NOTES AT A FLOATING RATE OF 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 62 BASIS POINTS, AND $850 MILLION OF SEVEN YEAR NOTES AT A FIXED RATE OF 3.125 PERCENT.  OUR FUNDING PLAN FOR THE FULL YEAR 2019 INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER SOURCES, APPROXIMATELY $6 BILLION TO $11 BILLION OF UNSECURED TERM DEBT ISSUANCE AND APPROXIMATELY $5 BILLION TO $9 BILLION OF SECURED TERM DEBT ISSUANCE. OUR FUNDING PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, SUCH AS FUTURE BUSINESS GROWTH, THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND OTHER EVENTS ON MARKET CAPACITY, DEMAND FOR SECURITIES OFFERED BY US, REGULATORY CHANGES, ABILITY TO SECURITIZE AND SELL RECEIVABLES, AND THE PERFORMANCE OF RECEIVABLES PREVIOUSLY SOLD IN SECURITIZATION TRANSACTIONS. MANY OF THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  56  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR EQUITY CAPITAL AND FUNDING STRATEGIES ARE DESIGNED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE AND STABLE UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS FROM THE MAJOR CREDIT RATING AGENCIES: MOODY\u2019S INVESTOR SERVICES (MOODY\u2019S), STANDARD & POOR\u2019S (S&P) AND FITCH RATINGS (FITCH). SUCH RATINGS HELP SUPPORT OUR ACCESS TO COST-EFFECTIVE UNSECURED FUNDING AS PART OF OUR OVERALL FUNDING STRATEGY. OUR ASSET SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES ARE RATED SEPARATELY.

DOWNGRADES IN THE RATINGS OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT OR ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAM SECURITIES COULD RESULT IN HIGHER FUNDING COSTS, AS WELL AS HIGHER FEES RELATED TO BORROWINGS UNDER OUR UNUSED LINES OF CREDIT. DECLINES IN CREDIT RATINGS COULD ALSO REDUCE OUR BORROWING CAPACITY IN THE UNSECURED DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATION CAPITAL MARKETS. WE BELIEVE OUR FUNDING MIX, INCLUDING THE PROPORTION OF U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION TO TOTAL FUNDING, SHOULD REDUCE THE IMPACT THAT CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADES WOULD HAVE ON OUR FUNDING CAPACITY AND COSTS.  LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT  OUR LIQUIDITY OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO A DIVERSE SET OF ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY SOURCES. WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY SOURCES IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR EXPECTED FUTURE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR LIQUIDITY FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS IN THE EVENT WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE NEW FUNDS UNDER OUR REGULAR FUNDING PROGRAMS DURING A SUBSTANTIAL WEAKENING IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  OUR LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY INCLUDES A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO.  \u2022  MAINTAINING DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES (REFER TO THE \u201cFUNDING STRATEGY\u201d SECTION FOR MORE DETAILS);  \u2022  MAINTAINING UNENCUMBERED LIQUID ASSETS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY SOURCES;  \u2022  PROJECTING CASH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS UNDER A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC AND MARKET SCENARIOS;  \u2022  ESTABLISHING CLEAR OBJECTIVES FOR LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS; AND  \u2022  INCORPORATING LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT AS APPROPRIATE INTO OUR CAPITAL ADEQUACY FRAMEWORK.  THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF LIQUIDITY RESOURCES WE MAINTAIN CAN VARY OVER TIME, BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF STRESS SCENARIOS REQUIRED UNDER THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT (DODD-FRANK) AND OTHER VARIOUS REGULATORY LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL STRESS SCENARIOS REQUIRED UNDER OUR LIQUIDITY RISK POLICY.  THE INVESTMENT INCOME WE RECEIVE ON LIQUIDITY RESOURCES IS LESS THAN THE INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR THESE BALANCES. THE NET INTEREST COSTS TO MAINTAIN THESE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL. THE LEVEL OF FUTURE NET INTEREST COSTS DEPENDS ON THE AMOUNT OF LIQUIDITY RESOURCES WE MAINTAIN AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COST OF FUNDING THESE AMOUNTS AND THEIR INVESTMENT YIELDS.  57  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SECURITIZED BORROWING CAPACITY  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE MAINTAINED A COMMITTED, REVOLVING, SECURED BORROWING FACILITY, WITH A MATURITY DATE OF JULY 15, 2020, WHICH GIVES US THE RIGHT TO SELL UP TO $3.0 BILLION FACE AMOUNT OF ELIGIBLE AAA NOTES FROM THE AMERICAN EXPRESS ISSUANCE TRUST II (THE CHARGE TRUST). ON JULY 12, 2019, WE EXTENDED THE CHARGE TRUST'S $3.0 BILLION FACILITY BY TWO YEARS TO MATURE ON JULY 15, 2022. WE ALSO MAINTAINED A COMMITTED, REVOLVING, SECURED BORROWING FACILITY, WITH A MATURITY DATE OF SEPTEMBER 15, 2020, WHICH GIVES US THE RIGHT TO SELL UP TO $2.0 BILLION FACE AMOUNT OF ELIGIBLE AAA CERTIFICATES FROM THE LENDING TRUST. BOTH FACILITIES ARE USED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO FUND SEASONAL WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, AS WELL AS TO FURTHER ENHANCE OUR CONTINGENT FUNDING RESOURCES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, NO AMOUNTS WERE DRAWN ON EITHER FACILITY.  FEDERAL RESERVE DISCOUNT WINDOW  AS AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, AENB MAY BORROW FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO, SUBJECT TO THE AMOUNT OF QUALIFYING COLLATERAL THAT IT MAY PLEDGE. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED THAT BOTH CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES ARE A FORM OF QUALIFYING COLLATERAL FOR SECURED BORROWINGS MADE THROUGH THE DISCOUNT WINDOW. WHETHER SPECIFIC ASSETS WILL BE CONSIDERED QUALIFYING COLLATERAL AND THE AMOUNT THAT MAY BE BORROWED AGAINST THE COLLATERAL, REMAIN AT THE DISCRETION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE.  WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $74.9 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 IN U.S. CREDIT CARD LOANS AND CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES THAT COULD BE SOLD OVER TIME THROUGH OUR SECURITIZATION TRUSTS OR PLEDGED IN RETURN FOR SECURED BORROWINGS TO PROVIDE FURTHER LIQUIDITY, SUBJECT IN EACH CASE TO APPLICABLE MARKET CONDITIONS AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA.  COMMITTED BANK CREDIT FACILITY  IN ADDITION TO THE SECURED BORROWING FACILITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE MAINTAINED A COMMITTED SYNDICATED BANK CREDIT FACILITY AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 OF $3.5 BILLION, WHICH EXPIRES ON OCTOBER 16, 2020. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, NO AMOUNTS WERE DRAWN ON THIS FACILITY.  UNUSED CREDIT OUTSTANDING  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $299 BILLION OF UNUSED CREDIT OUTSTANDING AS PART OF ESTABLISHED LENDING PRODUCT AGREEMENTS. TOTAL UNUSED CREDIT DOES NOT REPRESENT POTENTIAL FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS, AS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS UNUSED CREDIT WILL LIKELY NOT BE DRAWN. OUR CHARGE CARD PRODUCTS GENERALLY HAVE NO PRE-SET LIMIT, AND THEREFORE ARE NOT REFLECTED IN UNUSED CREDIT AVAILABLE TO CARD MEMBERS.  CASH FLOWS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOW ACTIVITY FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30.  TABLE 20: CASH FLOWS  (BILLIONS)  2019  2018  TOTAL CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN).

THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES.  58  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CHANGES IN CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO.  THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS DRIVEN BY A LARGER NET INCREASE IN THE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEPOSITS, LONG-TERM DEBT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, AS WELL AS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF SHARE REPURCHASES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  OTHER MATTERS  CERTAIN LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS  WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, AND THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE ARE SUBSTANTIAL. IN RECENT YEARS, THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS SCRUTINY, HIGH REGULATORY EXPECTATIONS, AND A STRINGENT AND UNPREDICTABLE ENFORCEMENT ENVIRONMENT.  GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES HAVE FOCUSED, AND WE BELIEVE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS, CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION ON REVIEWING COMPLIANCE BY FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS. REVIEWS TO ASSESS COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INTERNAL REVIEWS, HAVE RESULTED IN, AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, CHANGES TO OUR PRACTICES, PRODUCTS AND PROCEDURES, RESTITUTION TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY ACTIONS AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE THE SUBJECT OF SUCH ACTIONS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL INQUIRIES, INVESTIGATIONS, ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS AND THE IMPOSITION OF FINES OR CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES, IN THE EVENT OF NONCOMPLIANCE OR ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANCE WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE BEEN COOPERATING WITH CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES THAT HAVE REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM, OR SERVED SUBPOENAS ON, US, SEEKING INFORMATION RELATING TO A SMALL, SPECIALIZED PART OF OUR BUSINESS, KNOWN AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS (FXIP), WHICH OFFERS CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS SERVICES PRIMARILY TO SMALL AND MIDDLE MARKET BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN FIVE COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. IN PARTICULAR, WE RECEIVED INVESTIGATIVE SUBPOENAS FROM BOTH THE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL DIVISIONS OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS WELL AS INQUIRIES FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY, THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU (CFPB), THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION AND OTHERS.  FXIP ACCOUNTS FOR LESS THAN ONE HALF OF ONE PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND IS UNRELATED TO OUR CARD BUSINESSES. RELATEDLY, OUR REVIEW OF FXIP\u2019S PRICING PRACTICES CONDUCTED WITH AN OUTSIDE LAW FIRM HAS CONCLUDED AND AS A RESULT, WE ARE VOLUNTARILY PROVIDING APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION OF REMEDIATION TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS COVERING A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD AND TAKING DISCIPLINARY ACTION WHERE APPROPRIATE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS MATTER WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS OR RESULTS.  PLEASE SEE THE \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 (THE 2018 FORM 10-K) FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  PAYMENTS REGULATION  LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE FOCUSED ON THE OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING THROUGH ANTITRUST ACTIONS, LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS TO CHANGE CERTAIN PRACTICES OR PRICING OF CARD ISSUERS, MERCHANT ACQUIRERS AND PAYMENT NETWORKS, AND, IN SOME CASES, TO ESTABLISH BROAD AND ONGOING REGULATORY OVERSIGHT REGIMES FOR PAYMENT SYSTEMS.  59  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS HAVE FOCUSED ON INTERCHANGE FEES (THAT IS, THE FEE PAID BY THE BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUER IN PAYMENT NETWORKS LIKE VISA AND MASTERCARD), AS WELL AS THE RULES, CONTRACT TERMS AND PRACTICES GOVERNING MERCHANT CARD ACCEPTANCE. REGULATION AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS RELATING TO PRICING OR PRACTICES COULD AFFECT ALL NETWORKS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, AS WELL AS ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMERS AND MERCHANTS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATION OF BANKCARD FEES HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE DISCOUNT REVENUE WE EARN, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON OUR DISCOUNT RATE FROM DECREASES IN COMPETITOR PRICING IN CONNECTION WITH CAPS ON INTERCHANGE FEES. IN SOME CASES, REGULATIONS ALSO EXTEND TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS.  BROAD REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OVER PAYMENT SYSTEMS CAN ALSO INCLUDE, IN SOME CASES, REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNATIONAL CARD NETWORKS TO LOCALIZE ASPECTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS, SUCH AS PROCESSING INFRASTRUCTURE AND DATA STORAGE, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND DIMINISH THE VALUE OF OUR CLOSED LOOP. THE DEVELOPMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF PAYMENT SYSTEM REGULATORY REGIMES GENERALLY CONTINUE TO GROW AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AND MAINTAIN AND EXTEND OUR GLOBAL NETWORK.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON PAYMENTS REGULATION, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  SURCHARGING  IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES, SUCH AS CERTAIN MEMBER STATES IN THE EU AND AUSTRALIA, MERCHANTS ARE PERMITTED BY LAW TO SURCHARGE CARD PURCHASES. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF A NUMBER OF STATES IN THE UNITED STATES THAT PROHIBIT SURCHARGING HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED IN LITIGATION BROUGHT BY MERCHANT GROUPS AND SOME SUCH LAWS HAVE BEEN OVERTURNED. SURCHARGING IS AN ADVERSE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US IF IT BECOMES WIDESPREAD, PARTICULARLY WHERE IT ONLY OR DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, OTHER STEERING PRACTICES THAT ARE PERMITTED BY REGULATION IN SOME COUNTRIES COULD ALSO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US IF THEY BECOME WIDESPREAD.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF SURCHARGING AND OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD IMPAIR THE CARD MEMBER EXPERIENCE, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTION OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS REGULATION  IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR MARKETING, SALE AND SERVICING OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND OUR COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS ARE SUPERVISED AND EXAMINED BY THE CFPB, WHICH HAS BROAD RULEMAKING AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OVER PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, SAVINGS AND PAYMENT SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND AUTHORITY TO PREVENT \u201cUNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE\u201d ACTS OR PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF U.S. STATES HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION, DISCLOSURE AND OTHER LAWS (IN CERTAIN CASES MORE STRINGENT THAN U.S. FEDERAL LAWS). U.S. FEDERAL LAW ALSO REGULATES ABUSIVE DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES, WHICH ALONG WITH BANKRUPTCY AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS, CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT AMOUNTS OWED TO US OR SUBJECT US TO REGULATORY SCRUTINY.  ON MAY 7, 2019, THE CFPB ISSUED PROPOSED RULES THAT WOULD SET FORTH ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THIRD-PARTY DEBT COLLECTION AGENCIES, WHICH WE USE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN FINAL RULES, IF ANY, BECOMING EFFECTIVE BEFORE 2021.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS REGULATION, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  60  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ANTITRUST LITIGATION  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND CERTAIN STATES\u2019 ATTORNEYS GENERAL BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST US IN 2010 ALLEGING THAT THE PROVISIONS IN OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM ENGAGING IN VARIOUS ACTIONS TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OUR CARD PRODUCTS VIOLATE THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. ON JUNE 25, 2018, THE SUPREME COURT FOUND IN FAVOR OF AMERICAN EXPRESS IN THAT CASE. WE CONTINUE TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND SIMILAR ANTITRUST CLAIMS INITIATED BY MERCHANTS. SEE NOTE 7 TO THE \"CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\" FOR DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CASES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ACTIONS IMPAIRING THE CARD MEMBER EXPERIENCE, OR THE RESOLUTION OF ONE OR ANY COMBINATION OF THESE MERCHANT CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF AN ADVERSE DECISION IN THE MERCHANT LITIGATIONS ON OUR BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTION OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY  REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY CONTINUES TO INCREASE WORLDWIDE. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AND CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN POLICIES THAT PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, MEET EVOLVING CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS AND SUPPORT AND ENABLE BUSINESS INNOVATION AND GROWTH. GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE US HAVE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY RISK IN RECENT YEARS AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE THE TARGET OF INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED CYBER ATTACKS, INCLUDING COMPUTER VIRUSES, MALICIOUS OR DESTRUCTIVE CODE, RANSOMWARE, SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS (INCLUDING PHISHING, IMPERSONATION AND IDENTITY TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS), HACKING, WEBSITE DEFACEMENT, DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS AND OTHER ATTACKS AND SIMILAR DISRUPTIONS FROM THE MISCONFIGURATION OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OR ACCESS TO COMPUTER SYSTEMS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  REFER TO THE RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS SECTION OF NOTE 1 TO THE \u201cCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\u201d  GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY  ADJUSTED NET INTEREST INCOME  \u2014 A NON-GAAP MEASURE THAT REPRESENTS NET INTEREST INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR CARD MEMBER LOANS (WHICH INCLUDES, ON A GAAP BASIS, INTEREST THAT IS DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE), EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR CARD MEMBER LOANS. WE BELIEVE ADJUSTED NET INTEREST INCOME IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS THE INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR CARD MEMBER LOAN PORTFOLIO AND IT IS A COMPONENT OF NET INTEREST YIELD ON AVERAGE CARD MEMBER LOANS.  ASSET SECURITIZATIONS  \u2014 ASSET SECURITIZATION INVOLVES THE TRANSFER AND SALE OF LOANS OR RECEIVABLES TO A SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY CREATED FOR THE SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY, TYPICALLY A TRUST. THE TRUST, IN TURN, ISSUES SECURITIES, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES THAT ARE SECURED BY THE TRANSFERRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES. THE TRUST USES THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SUCH SECURITIES TO PAY THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE UNDERLYING LOANS OR RECEIVABLES. THE LOANS AND RECEIVABLES OF OUR LENDING TRUST AND CHARGE TRUST (COLLECTIVELY, THE TRUSTS) SECURITIZED ARE REPORTED AS ASSETS AND THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUSTS ARE REPORTED AS LIABILITIES ON OUR \u201cCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.\u201d  AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE \u2014  THIS CALCULATION IS GENERALLY DESIGNED TO REFLECT THE AVERAGE PRICING AT ALL MERCHANTS ACCEPTING AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AND REPRESENTS THE PERCENTAGE OF PROPRIETARY AND GNS BILLED BUSINESS RETAINED BY US FROM MERCHANTS WE ACQUIRE, OR FROM MERCHANTS ACQUIRED BY THIRD PARTIES ON OUR BEHALF, NET OF AMOUNTS RETAINED BY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.

SUCH REVOLVING BALANCES ARE INCLUDED WITHIN CARD MEMBER LOANS.  CHARGE CARDS  \u2014 REPRESENTS CARDS THAT GENERALLY CARRY NO PRE-SET SPENDING LIMITS AND ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED AS A METHOD OF PAYMENT AND NOT AS A MEANS OF FINANCING PURCHASES. CHARGE CARD MEMBERS GENERALLY MUST PAY THE FULL AMOUNT BILLED EACH MONTH. NO FINANCE CHARGES ARE ASSESSED ON CHARGE CARDS. EACH CHARGE CARD TRANSACTION IS AUTHORIZED BASED ON ITS LIKELY ECONOMICS REFLECTING A CARD MEMBER\u2019S MOST RECENT CREDIT INFORMATION AND SPEND PATTERNS. SOME CHARGE CARD ACCOUNTS HAVE ADDITIONAL PAY OVER TIME FEATURE(S) THAT ALLOW REVOLVING OF CERTAIN CHARGES.  COBRAND CARDS  \u2014 CARDS ISSUED UNDER COBRAND AGREEMENTS WITH SELECTED COMMERCIAL FIRMS. PURSUANT TO THE COBRAND AGREEMENTS, WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR COBRAND PARTNERS, WHICH CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, BASED PRIMARILY ON THE AMOUNT OF CARD MEMBER SPENDING AND CORRESPONDING REWARDS EARNED ON SUCH SPENDING AND, UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED. THE PARTNER IS THEN LIABLE FOR PROVIDING REWARDS TO THE CARD MEMBER UNDER THE COBRAND PARTNER\u2019S OWN LOYALTY PROGRAM.

DISCOUNT REVENUE  \u2014 PRIMARILY REPRESENTS REVENUE EARNED FROM FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHO HAVE ENTERED INTO A CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT. THE DISCOUNT FEE IS GENERALLY DEDUCTED FROM OUR PAYMENT FOR CARD MEMBER PURCHASES.  INTEREST EXPENSE  \u2014 INCLUDES INTEREST INCURRED PRIMARILY TO FUND CARD MEMBER LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES AND LIQUIDITY NEEDS, AND IS RECOGNIZED AS INCURRED. INTEREST EXPENSE IS DIVIDED PRINCIPALLY INTO TWO CATEGORIES: (I) DEPOSITS, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATES TO INTEREST EXPENSE ON DEPOSITS TAKEN FROM CUSTOMERS AND INSTITUTIONS, AND (II) DEBT, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATES TO INTEREST EXPENSE ON OUR LONG-TERM FINANCING AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, (E.G., COMMERCIAL PAPER, FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED, BANK OVERDRAFTS AND OTHER SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS), AS WELL AS THE REALIZED IMPACT OF DERIVATIVES HEDGING INTEREST RATE RISK ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT.  INTEREST INCOME  \u2014 INCLUDES (I) INTEREST ON LOANS, (II) INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND (III) INTEREST INCOME ON DEPOSITS WITH BANKS AND OTHER.  INTEREST ON LOANS  \u2014 ASSESSED USING THE AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE METHOD FOR CARD MEMBER LOANS. UNLESS THE LOAN IS CLASSIFIED AS NON-ACCRUAL, INTEREST IS RECOGNIZED BASED UPON THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNT AGREEMENT UNTIL THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE IS PAID OR WRITTEN OFF.  INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES  \u2014 PRIMARILY RELATES TO OUR PERFORMING FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. INTEREST INCOME IS RECOGNIZED AS EARNED USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD, WHICH ADJUSTS THE YIELD FOR SECURITY PREMIUMS AND DISCOUNTS, FEES AND OTHER PAYMENTS, SO A CONSTANT RATE OF RETURN IS RECOGNIZED ON THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE RELATED INVESTMENT SECURITY THROUGHOUT ITS TERM. AMOUNTS ARE RECOGNIZED UNTIL SECURITIES ARE IN DEFAULT OR WHEN IT IS LIKELY THAT FUTURE INTEREST PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE MADE AS SCHEDULED.  62  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST INCOME ON DEPOSITS WITH BANKS AND OTHER  \u2014 RECOGNIZED AS EARNED, AND PRIMARILY RELATES TO THE PLACEMENT OF CASH IN EXCESS OF NEAR-TERM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS IN INTEREST-BEARING TIME DEPOSITS, OVERNIGHT SWEEP ACCOUNTS, AND OTHER INTEREST-BEARING DEMAND AND CALL ACCOUNTS.

NET CARD FEES  \u2014 REPRESENTS THE CARD MEMBERSHIP FEES EARNED DURING THE PERIOD. THESE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE OVER THE COVERED CARD MEMBERSHIP PERIOD (TYPICALLY ONE YEAR), NET OF THE PROVISION FOR PROJECTED REFUNDS FOR CARD MEMBERSHIP CANCELLATION AND DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS.  NET INTEREST YIELD ON AVERAGE CARD MEMBER LOANS \u2014  A NON-GAAP MEASURE THAT IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING ADJUSTED NET INTEREST INCOME BY AVERAGE CARD MEMBER LOANS, COMPUTED ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. RESERVES AND NET WRITE-OFFS RELATED TO UNCOLLECTIBLE INTEREST ARE RECORDED THROUGH PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES, AND ARE THUS NOT INCLUDED IN THE NET INTEREST YIELD CALCULATION. WE BELIEVE NET INTEREST YIELD ON AVERAGE CARD MEMBER LOANS IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A MEASURE OF PROFITABILITY OF OUR CARD MEMBER LOAN PORTFOLIO.  NET LOSS RATIO  \u2014 REPRESENTS THE RATIO OF GCP CHARGE CARD WRITE-OFFS, CONSISTING OF PRINCIPAL (RESULTING FROM AUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS) AND FEE COMPONENTS, LESS RECOVERIES, ON CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS AMOUNTS BILLED TO CORPORATE CARD MEMBERS.  NET WRITE-OFF RATE  \u2014  PRINCIPAL ONLY  \u2014 REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF PROPRIETARY CONSUMER OR SMALL BUSINESS CARD MEMBER LOANS OR RECEIVABLES WRITTEN OFF, CONSISTING OF PRINCIPAL (RESULTING FROM AUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS), LESS RECOVERIES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE AVERAGE LOAN OR RECEIVABLES BALANCE DURING THE PERIOD.

WE MANUFACTURE OUR 3D-STRUCTURED LIGHT SCANNING SOLUTIONS SPECIFIC TO THE DENTAL INDUSTRY IN OUR ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN ITALY. WE EXPECT ALL OF OUR EXISTING MANUFACTURING FACILITIES TO HAVE THE PRODUCTION CAPACITY NECESSARY TO SUPPORT OUR VOLUME REQUIREMENTS THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  WE ACCOUNT FOR WHOLLY-OWNED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN THE CURRENCY OF THE RESPECTIVE FOREIGN JURISDICTION; THEREFORE, FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF THE INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNT BALANCES DENOMINATED IN DIFFERENT CURRENCIES AND REFLECTED IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE ARE AWARE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INCLUDING CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS, FORWARD CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS. HOWEVER, WE HAVE NOT USED SUCH INSTRUMENTS IN THE PAST, AND NONE WERE UTILIZED IN 2018 OR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019.  WE HAVE SOLD OUR PRODUCTS AND RELATED SERVICES TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT (THE \u201cGOVERNMENT\u201d) UNDER GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (\u201cGSA\u201d) FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE CONTRACTS (THE \u201cGSA CONTRACTS\u201d) SINCE 2002 AND ARE CURRENTLY SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND RELATED SERVICES TO THE GOVERNMENT UNDER TWO SUCH GSA CONTRACTS. EACH GSA CONTRACT IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS, A PRICE REDUCTION CLAUSE (THE \u201cPRICE REDUCTION CLAUSE\u201d), WHICH GENERALLY REQUIRES US TO REDUCE THE PRICES BILLED TO THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE GSA CONTRACTS TO CORRESPOND TO THE LOWEST PRICES BILLED TO CERTAIN BENCHMARK CUSTOMERS.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, DURING AN INTERNAL REVIEW WE PRELIMINARILY DETERMINED THAT CERTAIN OF OUR PRICING PRACTICES MAY HAVE RESULTED IN THE GOVERNMENT BEING OVERCHARGED UNDER THE PRICE REDUCTION CLAUSES OF THE GSA CONTRACTS (THE \u201cGSA MATTER\u201d). ON FEBRUARY 14, 2019, WE REPORTED THE GSA MATTER TO THE GSA AND ITS OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL.  AS A RESULT OF THE GSA MATTER, FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WE REDUCED OUR TOTAL SALES BY A $4.8 MILLION ESTIMATED CUMULATIVE SALES ADJUSTMENT, REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LAST SIX YEARS OF ESTIMATED OVERCHARGES TO THE GOVERNMENT UNDER THE GSA CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WE RECORDED $0.5 MILLION OF IMPUTED INTEREST RELATED TO THE ESTIMATED CUMULATIVE SALES ADJUSTMENT, WHICH INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE, NET AND RESULTED IN AN ESTIMATED TOTAL LIABILITY OF $5.3 MILLION FOR THE GSA MATTER. THIS ADJUSTMENT WAS BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY REVIEW AS OF FEBRUARY 20, 2019, THE DATE OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. IN ADDITION, IN FIRST QUARTER 2019, WE RECORDED AN ADDITIONAL $0.1 MILLION OF IMPUTED INTEREST RELATED TO THE ESTIMATED CUMULATIVE SALES ADJUSTMENT.  ON JULY 15, 2019, WE SUBMITTED A REPORT TO THE GSA AND ITS OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL SETTING FORTH THE FINDINGS OF THE REVIEW OF OUR PRICING AND OTHER PRACTICES UNDER THE GSA CONTRACTS CONDUCTED BY OUR OUTSIDE LEGAL COUNSEL AND FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS (THE \u201cREVIEW\u201d).  BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE REVIEW, WE REDUCED OUR TOTAL SALES FOR SECOND QUARTER 2019 BY AN INCREMENTAL  $5.8 MILLION  SALES ADJUSTMENT, REFLECTING AN ESTIMATED AGGREGATE OVERCHARGE OF  $10.6 MILLION  UNDER THE GSA CONTRACTS FOR THE PERIOD FROM JULY 2011 TO MARCH 2019. IN ADDITION, WE RECORDED AN INCREMENTAL  $0.4 MILLION  OF IMPUTED INTEREST RELATED TO THE ESTIMATED CUMULATIVE SALES ADJUSTMENT IN THE SECOND QUARTER 2019, WHICH INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE, NET AND RESULTED IN A  $6.2 MILLION  INCREASE IN THE ESTIMATED TOTAL LIABILITY FOR THE GSA MATTER. AS OF THE DATE OF THE FILING OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, WE HAVE RECORDED AN AGGREGATE ESTIMATED TOTAL LIABILITY FOR THE GSA MATTER OF  $11.6 MILLION.  ON APRIL 27, 2018, WE INVESTED  $1.8 MILLION  IN PRESENT4D GMBH (\u201cPRESENT4D\u201d), A SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS PROVIDER FOR PROFESSIONAL VIRTUAL REALITY PRESENTATIONS AND TRAINING ENVIRONMENTS, IN THE FORM OF AN EQUITY CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION. THIS INITIAL CONTRIBUTION REPRESENTED A MINORITY INVESTMENT IN PRESENT4D. THIS INVESTMENT\u2019S BUSINESS PURPOSE IS TO COORDINATE THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF MODULES SUPPORTING COMPATIBILITY WITH VIRTUAL REALITY FOR OUR EXISTING SOFTWARE OFFERINGS. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE DETERMINED IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT RECOVER OUR COST BASIS IN PRESENT4D AND RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF  $1.5 MILLION  , WHICH IS INCLUDED IN OTHER EXPENSE, NET. NOTWITHSTANDING THE AFOREMENTIONED IMPAIRMENT CHARGE BASED ON OUR CURRENT VALUATION OF PRESENT4D, WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE IN THE BENEFITS OF PRESENT4D\u2019S TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO OUR BUSINESS. WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED SUPPORT TO PRESENT4D DURING 2018 OR THE THREE OR SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 OUTSIDE OF OUR INITIAL INVESTMENT OF  $1.8 MILLION  . HOWEVER, WE MAY PROVIDE FUTURE SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF LOANS OR OTHER CREDIT EXTENDED TO PRESENT4D OR ADDITIONAL SHARE CAPITAL PURCHASES.  SINCE THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, THE FOLLOWING CHANGES WERE MADE TO OUR VERTICALS AND REPORTING SEGMENTS.  \u2022  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, WE MERGED THE HISTORICAL FACTORY METROLOGY AND 3D MACHINE VISION VERTICALS INTO ONE VERTICAL NAMED \u201c3D FACTORY\u201d FOR GREATER CONSISTENCY WITH OUR REALIGNED REPORTING SEGMENTS.  \u2022  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, WE SEGREGATED THE OPERATIONS OF OUR ACQUISITIONS OF LASER CONTROL SYSTEMS LIMITED AND LANMARK CONTROLS, INC., ALONG WITH THE OPERATIONS RESULTING FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF INSTRUMENT ASSOCIATES, LLC D/B/A NUTFIELD TECHNOLOGY, INTO A VERTICAL THAT WE NAMED \u201cPHOTONICS.\u201d THE CREATION OF THIS VERTICAL ENABLES US TO BETTER FOCUS ON OUR PRODUCT RANGE DIRECTED AT LASER STEERING. THESE OPERATIONS WERE HISTORICALLY REPORTED IN THE 3D FACTORY REPORTING SEGMENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018 AND ARE NOW INCLUDED IN THE EMERGING VERTICALS (FORMERLY KNOWN AS \u201cOTHER\u201d) REPORTING SEGMENT.  \u2022  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, WE RENAMED OUR PRODUCT DESIGN VERTICAL \u201c3D DESIGN.\u201d  \u2022  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WE RENAMED OUR 3D FACTORY VERTICAL AND REPORTING SEGMENT \u201c3D MANUFACTURING.\u201d  THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE IN OUR TOTAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES IN OUR VERTICALS AND REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.

OUR PRODUCT SALES DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $5.0 MILLION REDUCTION IN PRODUCT SALES RELATED TO THE GSA INCREMENTAL SALES ADJUSTMENT, THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND A DECREASE IN UNIT SALES WITHIN OUR 3D MANUFACTURING REPORTING SEGMENT, ESPECIALLY IN OUR ASIA-PACIFIC REGION. SERVICE REVENUE  INCREASED  BY  $3.0 MILLION  , OR  13.2%  , TO  $25.5 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  FROM  $22.5 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO AN  INCREASE  IN CUSTOMER SERVICE REVENUE AND WARRANTY REVENUE DRIVEN BY THE GROWTH OF OUR INSTALLED BASE AND OUR FOCUSED AFTER-MARKET SALES INITIATIVES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE $0.8 MILLION REDUCTION IN SERVICE SALES RELATED TO THE GSA INCREMENTAL SALES ADJUSTMENT. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON TOTAL SALES OF $2.5 MILLION, DECREASING OUR OVERALL SALES GROWTH RATE BY APPROXIMATELY 2.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE WEAKENING OF THE EURO AND CHINESE YUAN RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR.

THIS  INCREASE  WAS MOSTLY DUE TO AN AGGREGATE INCREMENTAL COST OF $1.5 MILLION RELATED TO OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (\u201cCEO\u201d) SUCCESSION, AS WE RECOGNIZED ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 IN CONNECTION WITH THE JUNE 2019 VESTING OF OPTION AWARDS HELD BY OUR FORMER CEO AND THE $0.5 MILLION SIGNING BONUS TO OUR CURRENT CEO, AS WELL AS ADVISORY FEES OF $0.7 MILLION INCURRED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 RELATED TO THE GSA MATTER.

THE CHANGES IN OUR INCOME TAX (BENEFIT) EXPENSE AND OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO A PRETAX LOSS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO PRETAX INCOME IN THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $0.9 MILLION INCREASE IN OUR RESERVE FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS RECORDED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 DUE TO A CHANGE IN OUR JUDGMENT ON THE RECOGNITION OF A TAX POSITION DURING THE QUARTER.  OUR QUARTERLY ESTIMATE OF OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND OUR QUARTERLY PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX (BENEFIT) EXPENSE ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VARIATION DUE TO NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING VARIABILITY IN ACCURATELY PREDICTING OUR PRETAX AND TAXABLE INCOME OR LOSS AND THE MIX OF JURISDICTIONS TO WHICH THEY RELATE, AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF PRETAX INCOME OR LOSS RECOGNIZED DURING THE QUARTER.

OF OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS,  $80.9 MILLION  WAS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AS OF JUNE 30, 2019. ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE UNITED STATES ENACTED THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING TAX LAW, WHICH INCLUDED A TRANSITION TAX ON THE MANDATORY DEEMED REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. DESPITE THE CHANGES IN U.S. TAX LAW, OUR CURRENT INTENT IS TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST THESE FUNDS IN OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AS THE CASH IS NEEDED TO FUND ONGOING OPERATIONS.  ON NOVEMBER 24, 2008, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A $30.0 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME AT PREVAILING PRICES, AS PERMITTED BY SECURITIES LAWS AND OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, AND SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. THERE IS NO EXPIRATION DATE OR OTHER RESTRICTION GOVERNING THE PERIOD OVER WHICH WE CAN REPURCHASE SHARES UNDER THE PROGRAM. IN OCTOBER 2015, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN INCREASE TO THE EXISTING SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FROM $30.0 MILLION TO $50.0 MILLION.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND ANTICIPATED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY OPERATING REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  WE HAVE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  WE ENTER INTO PURCHASE COMMITMENTS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THESE PURCHASES GENERALLY COVER PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS FOR 60 TO 120 DAYS AS WELL AS MATERIALS NECESSARY TO SERVICE CUSTOMER UNITS THROUGH THE PRODUCT LIFECYCLE AND FOR WARRANTY COMMITMENTS. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE HAD  $49.1 MILLION  IN PURCHASE COMMITMENTS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE DELIVERED WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. OTHER THAN AS DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING SENTENCES, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS TABLE INCLUDED IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  ESTABLISHES A THREE-LEVEL HIERARCHY FOR DISCLOSURE OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, BASED ON THE TRANSPARENCY OF INPUTS TO THE VALUATION OF AN ASSET OR LIABILITY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE, AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  LEVEL 1 \u2013 INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS.  \u2022  LEVEL 2 \u2013 INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, AND INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.  \u2022  LEVEL 3 \u2013 INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE UNOBSERVABLE AND SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.  14  CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC.

ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTIMATES PRESENTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE AMOUNTS THE COMPANY WOULD REALIZE IN A CURRENT MARKET EXCHANGE.  THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RESTRICTED CASH, RECEIVABLES, PAYABLES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE BECAUSE OF THE SHORT MATURITY OF THOSE INSTRUMENTS.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY INCLUDE THE COMPANY'S CROSS-CURRENCY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND WERE VALUED AT  $323  MILLION  AND  $237  MILLION  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SENIOR NOTES AND DEBENTURES AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS AND IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 1 OF THE VALUATION HIERARCHY, WHILE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CREDIT FACILITIES IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES IN INACTIVE MARKETS AND IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL 2.  THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE CONSOLIDATED VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY'S MORTGAGE NOTE LIABILITY APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE.  A SUMMARY OF THE CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE OF DEBT AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  IS AS FOLLOWS.  JUNE 30, 2019  DECEMBER 31, 2018  CARRYING VALUE  FAIR VALUE  CARRYING VALUE  FAIR VALUE  SENIOR NOTES AND DEBENTURES  $62,217  $66,122  $62,868  $61,087  CREDIT FACILITIES  $11,089  $11,123  $9,959  $9,608  NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  THE COMPANY\u2019S NONFINANCIAL ASSETS SUCH AS EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS, FRANCHISES, PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS; HOWEVER, THEY ARE SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS WHEN THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST.

(\"QURATE\") AND IS ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF QURATE.  QURATE WHOLLY OWNS HSN, INC. (\u201cHSN\u201d) AND QVC, INC. (\u201cQVC\u201d).  THE COMPANY HAS PROGRAMMING RELATIONSHIPS WITH HSN AND QVC.  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY RECORDED REVENUE IN AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY  $12  MILLION  AND  $24  MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AND FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , THE COMPANY RECORDED REVENUE IN AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY  $17  MILLION  AND  $33  MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, FROM HSN AND QVC AS PART OF CHANNEL CARRIAGE FEES AND REVENUE SHARING ARRANGEMENTS FOR HOME SHOPPING SALES MADE TO CUSTOMERS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S FOOTPRINT.

THE COMPANY PURCHASES PROGRAMMING FROM DISCOVERY PURSUANT TO AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO PRIOR TO DR. MALONE AND MR. MIRON JOINING CHARTER\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  BASED ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT DISCOVERY WOULD CURRENTLY BE CONSIDERED A RELATED PARTY.

CONTINGENCIES  IN AUGUST 2015, A PURPORTED STOCKHOLDER OF CHARTER, MATTHEW SCIABACUCCHI, FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY, ON BEHALF OF A PUTATIVE CLASS OF CHARTER STOCKHOLDERS, CHALLENGING THE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING CHARTER, TWC, A/N, AND LIBERTY BROADBAND ANNOUNCED BY CHARTER ON MAY 26, 2015. THE LAWSUIT, WHICH NAMED AS DEFENDANTS CHARTER AND ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, ALLEGED THAT THE TRANSACTIONS RESULTED FROM BREACHES OF FIDUCIARY DUTY BY CHARTER\u2019S DIRECTORS AND THAT LIBERTY BROADBAND IMPROPERLY BENEFITED FROM THE CHALLENGED TRANSACTIONS AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER CHARTER STOCKHOLDERS. THE LAWSUIT HAS PROCEEDED TO THE DISCOVERY PHASE.  CHARTER DENIES ANY LIABILITY, BELIEVES THAT IT HAS SUBSTANTIAL DEFENSES, AND INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THIS LAWSUIT. ALTHOUGH CHARTER IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS LAWSUIT, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THE OUTCOME WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR CASH FLOWS.  THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE ALAMEDA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY ARE INVESTIGATING WHETHER CERTAIN OF CHARTER\u2019S WASTE DISPOSAL POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES ARE IN VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE AND THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE. THAT INVESTIGATION WAS COMMENCED IN JANUARY 2014. A SIMILAR INVESTIGATION INVOLVING TWC WAS INITIATED  20  CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (UNAUDITED)  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS AND WHERE INDICATED)  IN FEBRUARY 2012.  CHARTER IS COOPERATING WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS.  WHILE THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE OUTCOME WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR CASH FLOWS.  ON DECEMBER 19, 2011, SPRINT COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY L.P. (\u201cSPRINT\u201d) FILED A COMPLAINT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS ALLEGING THAT TWC INFRINGED CERTAIN U.S. PATENTS PURPORTEDLY RELATING TO VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL (\u201cVOIP\u201d) SERVICES. AT THE TRIAL, THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT OF  $140  MILLION  AGAINST TWC AND FURTHER CONCLUDED THAT TWC HAD WILLFULLY INFRINGED SPRINT\u2019S PATENTS.  THE COURT SUBSEQUENTLY DECLINED TO ENHANCE THE DAMAGE AWARD AS A RESULT OF THE PURPORTED WILLFUL INFRINGEMENT AND AWARDED SPRINT AN ADDITIONAL  $6  MILLION  , REPRESENTING PRE-JUDGMENT INTEREST ON THE DAMAGES AWARD.  THE COMPANY APPEALED THE CASE TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT WHERE THE COMPANY LOST THE APPEAL.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO PETITION THE SUPREME COURT AS THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURSUE ITS APPEAL RIGHTS.  IN ADDITION TO ITS APPEAL, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURSUE INDEMNITY FROM ONE OF ITS VENDORS AND HAS BROUGHT A PATENT SUIT AGAINST SPRINT (TC TECH, LLC V. SPRINT) IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE IMPLICATING SPRINT'S LTE TECHNOLOGY.  THE EXPECTED FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE SPRINT VERDICT HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE OUTCOME OF THIS LITIGATION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  THE ULTIMATE OUTCOMES OF THE APPEAL OF THE SPRINT KANSAS CASE, THE PURSUIT OF INDEMNITY AGAINST THE COMPANY\u2019S VENDOR AND THE TC TECH LITIGATION CANNOT BE PREDICTED.  SPRINT FILED A SECOND SUIT AGAINST CHARTER ON DECEMBER 2, 2017 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE.  THIS SUIT ALLEGES INFRINGEMENT OF 15 PATENTS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S PROVISION OF VOIP SERVICES (TEN OF WHICH WERE ASSERTED AGAINST LEGACY TWC IN THE MATTER DESCRIBED ABOVE).  CHARTER IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING THIS CASE.  WHILE THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS SPRINT SUIT, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THIS LITIGATION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR CASH FLOWS.  SPRINT FILED A THIRD SUIT AGAINST CHARTER ON MAY 17, 2018 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA.  THIS SUIT ALLEGES INFRINGEMENT OF THREE PATENTS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S VIDEO ON DEMAND SERVICES.  THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING THIS CASE.  THE PARTIES RECENTLY AGREED TO TRANSFER THIS CASE TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE.  WHILE THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THIS LITIGATION, IT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THIS LITIGATION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR CASH FLOWS.  THE NEW YORK PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (THE \u201cPSC\u201d), THE REGULATOR FOR THE CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES IN NEW YORK (WHOSE CHAIR DIRECTS AND OPERATES AS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICE (\u201cDPS\u201d)), ISSUED MULTIPLE ORDERS AGAINST CHARTER INCLUDING TWO ORDERS ON JULY 27, 2018 RELATING TO THE AGREEMENT BY WHICH THE PSC APPROVED CHARTER\u2019S MERGER WITH TWC.  ONE ORDER DETERMINED THAT CHARTER HAD FAILED TO SATISFY ONE OF ITS MERGER CONDITIONS BY NOT EXTENDING ITS HIGH SPEED BROADBAND NETWORK ACCORDING TO THE PSC\u2019S INTERPRETATION OF WHICH HOMES AND BUSINESSES CHARTER BUILT TO SHOULD COUNT.  THE ORDER FURTHER DIRECTED THE INITIATION OF A COURT ACTION TO IMPOSE FINANCIAL AND OTHER PENALTIES ON CHARTER WHICH THE PSC INITIATED.  THE SECOND ORDER PURPORTED TO RESCIND THE PSC\u2019S JANUARY 2016 APPROVAL OF CHARTER\u2019S MERGER WITH TWC\u2019S NEW YORK OPERATIONS AND DIRECTED CHARTER TO SUBMIT A PLAN TO EFFECT AN ORDERLY TRANSITION TO A SUCCESSOR PROVIDER OR PROVIDERS AND FOR CHARTER TO CEASE OPERATIONS IN NEW YORK WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THE ORDER WHICH DEADLINE WAS EXTENDED AS THE DPS AND CHARTER NEGOTIATED A RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS.  ON APRIL 19, 2019, DPS AND CHARTER JOINTLY PRESENTED TO THE PSC A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT TO RESOLVE THESE DISPUTES, AND ON JULY 11, 2019, THE PSC APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT.  THE SETTLEMENT RESOLVED ALL OUTSTANDING MATTERS REGARDING THESE DISPUTES.  NO PENALTIES OR FORFEITURE WERE ASSESSED AS A RESULT OF THE AGREEMENT, AND THE COMPANY WAS NOT FOUND TO HAVE COMMITTED, NOR DID IT ADMIT TO, ANY VIOLATION. THE INCREMENTAL OPERATING AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY TO MEET THE BUILDOUT AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY.  IN ADDITION TO THE SPRINT LITIGATION DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT OR CO-DEFENDANT IN SEVERAL ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS INVOLVING ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OF VARIOUS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESSES. OTHER INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS ARE ALSO DEFENDANTS IN CERTAIN OF THESE CASES. IN THE EVENT THAT A COURT ULTIMATELY DETERMINES THAT THE COMPANY INFRINGES ON ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES AND/OR AN INJUNCTION THAT COULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY OR ITS VENDORS TO MODIFY CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THE COMPANY OFFERS TO ITS SUBSCRIBERS, AS WELL AS NEGOTIATE ROYALTY OR LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AT ISSUE. WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE LAWSUITS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THE ACTIONS VIGOROUSLY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT ANY ADVERSE OUTCOME WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR LIQUIDITY. THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH CLAIMS NOR CAN IT REASONABLY ESTIMATE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS.  21  CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (UNAUDITED)  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS AND WHERE INDICATED)  THE COMPANY IS PARTY TO OTHER LAWSUITS, CLAIMS AND REGULATORY INQUIRIES THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF CONDUCTING ITS BUSINESS. THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE OTHER LEGAL MATTERS PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY CANNOT BE PREDICTED, AND ALTHOUGH SUCH LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS ARE NOT EXPECTED INDIVIDUALLY TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY, SUCH LAWSUITS COULD HAVE, IN THE AGGREGATE, A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY. WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPANY ULTIMATELY PREVAILS IN ANY PARTICULAR LAWSUIT OR CLAIM, LITIGATION CAN BE TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY AND INJURE THE COMPANY\u2019S REPUTATION.  20.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS  THE COMPANY SPONSORS TWO QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, THE TWC PENSION PLAN AND THE TWC UNION PENSION PLAN, THAT PROVIDE PENSION BENEFITS TO A MAJORITY OF EMPLOYEES WHO WERE EMPLOYED BY TWC BEFORE THE ACQUISITION OF TWC. THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES A NONQUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES UNDER THE TWC EXCESS PENSION PLAN.  PENSION BENEFITS ARE BASED ON FORMULAS THAT REFLECT THE EMPLOYEES\u2019 YEARS OF SERVICE AND COMPENSATION DURING THEIR EMPLOYMENT PERIOD.  ACTUARIAL GAINS OR LOSSES ARE CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF EITHER THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION OR THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS RESULTING FROM EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT FROM THAT ASSUMED OR FROM CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS.  THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO FOLLOW A MARK-TO-MARKET PENSION ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR RECORDING THE ACTUARIAL GAINS OR LOSSES ANNUALLY DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, OR EARLIER IF A REMEASUREMENT EVENT OCCURS DURING AN INTERIM PERIOD.  NO FUTURE COMPENSATION INCREASES OR FUTURE SERVICE WILL BE CREDITED TO PARTICIPANTS OF THE PENSION PLANS GIVEN THE FROZEN NATURE OF THE PLANS.  THE COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC PENSION BENEFIT (COSTS) FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  ARE RECORDED IN OTHER PENSION BENEFITS, NET IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING.  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019  2018  2019  2018  INTEREST COST  $(  32  )  $(  32  )  $(  64  )  $(  64  )  EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS  41  52  82  104  NET PERIODIC PENSION BENEFITS  $9  $20  $18  $40  THE COMPANY MADE NO CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  ; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY MAKE DISCRETIONARY CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS IN THE FUTURE. SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE DEPENDENT ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CURRENT AND EXPECTED INTEREST RATES, ASSET PERFORMANCE, THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS AND MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT. FOR THE NONQUALIFIED UNFUNDED PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS DURING  2019  TO THE EXTENT BENEFITS ARE PAID.  21.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED JANUARY 1, 2018  ASU NO. 2014-09, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d)  UPON ADOPTION OF ASU 2014-09, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT WHICH INCLUDED AN INCREASE TO TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY OF  $38  MILLION  AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018.  ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED JANUARY 1, 2019  ASU NO. 2016-02, LEASES (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d)  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-02 WHICH REQUIRES LESSEES TO RECOGNIZE ALMOST ALL LEASES ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET AS A LEASE ASSET AND A LEASE LIABILITY.  FOR INCOME STATEMENT PURPOSES, THE FASB RETAINED A DUAL MODEL, REQUIRING LEASES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER OPERATING OR FINANCE. CLASSIFICATION IS BASED ON CRITERIA LARGELY SIMILAR TO THE CRITERIA APPLIED UNDER LEGACY LEASE ACCOUNTING, BUT WITHOUT EXPLICIT BRIGHT LINES.  22  CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (UNAUDITED)  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS AND WHERE INDICATED)  THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2016-02 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH WITH A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT RECORDED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION (JANUARY 1, 2019). THEREFORE, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED OPERATING LEASES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WITHOUT REVISING COMPARATIVE PERIOD INFORMATION OR DISCLOSURE.  AT TRANSITION, THE COMPANY ELECTED THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS PERMITTED UNDER THE TRANSITION GUIDANCE WITHIN THE STANDARD, WHICH ELIMINATES THE REASSESSMENT OF PAST LEASES, CLASSIFICATION AND INITIAL DIRECT COSTS. THE COMPANY DID NOT ELECT TO USE HINDSIGHT TO REASSESS LEASE TERMS OR IMPAIRMENT AT THE ADOPTION DATE.  THE COMPANY ELECTED THE LAND EASEMENTS PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY NOT TO RETROSPECTIVELY TREAT LAND EASEMENTS AS LEASES; HOWEVER, MUST APPLY LEASE ACCOUNTING PROSPECTIVELY TO LAND EASEMENTS IF THEY MEET THE DEFINITION OF A LEASE.  THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED INTERNAL CONTROLS AND KEY SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY TO ENABLE THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON ADOPTION.  THE NEW STANDARD RESULTED IN THE RECORDING OF LEASED ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING LEASES OF APPROXIMATELY  $1.1  BILLION  AND  $1.2  BILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LEASED ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES PRIMARILY REPRESENTS THE PRIOR YEAR END DEFERRED RENT LIABILITIES BALANCE, RESULTING FROM HISTORICAL STRAIGHT-LINING OF OPERATING LEASES, WHICH WAS EFFECTIVELY RECLASSIFIED UPON ADOPTION TO REDUCE THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LEASED ASSETS.  THE ADOPTION OF THE STANDARD DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND IS NOT ANTICIPATED TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL INTERIM AND ANNUAL LEASE DISCLOSURES.  SEE NOTE 5 FOR INTERIM LEASE DISCLOSURES FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019.  ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED  ASU NO. 2016-13, MEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d)  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-13, WHICH REQUIRES A FINANCIAL ASSET (OR A GROUP OF FINANCIAL ASSETS) MEASURED AT AMORTIZED COST BASIS TO BE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT UNDER THE CURRENT EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS MODEL RATHER THAN AN INCURRED LOSS MODEL. THE MEASUREMENT OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES IS BASED ON RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT PAST EVENTS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT CONDITIONS AND REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE FORECASTS THAT AFFECT THE COLLECTABILITY OF THE REPORTED AMOUNT.  ASU 2016-13 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019 (JANUARY 1, 2020 FOR THE COMPANY). EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED.  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE IMPACT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-13 WILL HAVE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ASU NO. 2017-04, SIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT (\u201cASU 2017-04\u201d)  IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-04 WHICH ELIMINATES STEP TWO FROM THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. UNDER THE NEW STANDARD, TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY WILL RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECOGNIZED SHOULD NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THE REPORTING UNIT. ASU 2017-04 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019 (JANUARY 1, 2020 FOR THE COMPANY). EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-04 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ASU NO. 2018-15, CUSTOMER\u2019S ACCOUNTING FOR IMPLEMENTATION COSTS IN A CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT (\"ASU 2018-15\")  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-15 WHICH REQUIRES UPFRONT IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED IN A CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENT (OR HOSTING ARRANGEMENT) THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT TO BE AMORTIZED TO HOSTING EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENT.  ASU 2018-15 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019 (JANUARY 1, 2020 FOR THE COMPANY).  EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED.  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE IMPACT THAT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2018-15 WILL HAVE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ASU NO. 2019-02, IMPROVEMENTS TO ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS OF FILMS AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS FOR PROGRAM MATERIALS (\"ASU 2019-02\")  IN MARCH 2019, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2019-02 WHICH ALIGNS THE ACCOUNTING FOR PRODUCTION COSTS OF AN EPISODIC TELEVISION SERIES WITH THE ACCOUNTING FOR PRODUCTION COSTS OF FILMS REGARDING COST CAPITALIZATION, AMORTIZATION, IMPAIRMENT, PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE.  ASU 2019-02 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019 (JANUARY 1, 2020  23  CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (UNAUDITED)  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS AND WHERE INDICATED)  FOR THE COMPANY). EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED.

(TOGETHER WITH ITS CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARIES, \u201cCHARTER\u201d) IS THE SECOND LARGEST CABLE OPERATOR IN THE UNITED STATES AND A LEADING BROADBAND COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES COMPANY PROVIDING VIDEO, INTERNET AND VOICE SERVICES TO APPROXIMATELY  28.7 MILLION  RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESS CUSTOMERS AT  JUNE 30, 2019  .  WE ALSO RECENTLY LAUNCHED OUR MOBILE SERVICE TO RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS.  IN ADDITION, WE SELL VIDEO AND ONLINE ADVERTISING INVENTORY TO LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISING CUSTOMERS AND FIBER-DELIVERED COMMUNICATIONS AND MANAGED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS TO LARGER ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS.  WE ALSO OWN AND OPERATE REGIONAL SPORTS NETWORKS AND LOCAL SPORTS, NEWS AND COMMUNITY CHANNELS.  CHARTER IS A HOLDING COMPANY WHOSE PRINCIPAL ASSET IS A CONTROLLING EQUITY INTEREST IN CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS, LLC (\u201cCHARTER HOLDINGS\u201d), AN INDIRECT OWNER OF CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS OPERATING, LLC (\u201cCHARTER OPERATING\u201d) UNDER WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE OPERATIONS RESIDE. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS AMONG CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.  OVERVIEW  SINCE THE CLOSE OF THE ACQUISITIONS IN 2016 OF TIME WARNER CABLE INC. (\"TWC\") AND BRIGHT HOUSE NETWORKS, LLC (\"BRIGHT HOUSE\"), WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON INTEGRATING THE PRACTICES AND SYSTEMS OF CHARTER, TWC AND BRIGHT HOUSE, CENTRALIZING OUR PRODUCT, MARKETING, SALES AND SERVICE OPERATIONS, INSOURCING THE TWC AND BRIGHT HOUSE WORKFORCES IN OUR CALL CENTERS AND FIELD OPERATIONS, AND ROLLING OUT SPECTRUM PRICING AND PACKAGING (\"SPP\") TO TWC AND BRIGHT HOUSE SERVICE AREAS.  IN 2018, WE COMPLETED THE CONVERSION OF THE REMAINING TWC AND BRIGHT HOUSE ANALOG SERVICE AREAS TO AN ALL-DIGITAL PLATFORM ENABLING US TO DELIVER MORE HD CHANNELS AND HIGHER INTERNET SPEEDS. NEARLY ALL OF OUR FOOTPRINT IS NOW ALL-DIGITAL.  ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE DOUBLED MINIMUM INTERNET SPEEDS TO 200 MBPS IN A NUMBER OF SERVICE AREAS AT NO ADDITIONAL COST TO NEW AND EXISTING SPP INTERNET CUSTOMERS.  IN 2018, LEVERAGING DOCSIS 3.1 TECHNOLOGY, WE ALSO EXPANDED THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR SPECTRUM INTERNET GIG SERVICE TO NEARLY ALL OF OUR FOOTPRINT.  WITH OUR INTEGRATION NEARLY COMPLETE, WE ARE FOCUSED ON OPERATING AS ONE COMPANY, WITH A UNIFIED PRODUCT, MARKETING AND SERVICE INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO ACCELERATE GROWTH AND INNOVATE FASTER.  WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LESS CUSTOMER-FACING CHANGE EXPECTED IN 2019, WE ARE FOCUSED ON DEPLOYING SUPERIOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICE WITH MINIMAL SERVICE DISRUPTIONS.  WE EXPECT OUR GROWING LEVELS OF PRODUCTIVITY WILL RESULT IN LOWER CUSTOMER CHURN, LONGER CUSTOMER LIFETIMES AND IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY WITH FEWER CUSTOMER CALLS AND TRUCK ROLLS PER CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP.  WITH OVER 80% OF OUR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER BASE NOW IN SPP PACKAGES, WE EXPECT ADDITIONAL BENEFITS FROM LOWER LEGACY PACKAGE MIGRATION ACTIVITY, COMBINED WITH SPP CUSTOMERS ROLLING OFF INTRODUCTORY PRICING AND MODEST PRICE INCREASES.  FURTHER, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP GROWTH THROUGH SALES OF VIDEO, INTERNET, WIRELINE VOICE AND MOBILE PACKAGED SERVICES.  ADDITIONALLY, WITH THE COMPLETION OF OUR ALL-DIGITAL CONVERSION, ROLL-OUT OF DOCSIS 3.1 TECHNOLOGY ACROSS OUR FOOTPRINT, AND THE INTEGRATION OF TWC AND BRIGHT HOUSE MOSTLY COMPLETE, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A MEANINGFUL REDUCTION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENT OF REVENUE IN 2019 AND EXPECT THESE REDUCTIONS TO CONTINUE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, WE LAUNCHED OUR MOBILE PRODUCT, SPECTRUM MOBILE, UNDER OUR MOBILE VIRTUAL NETWORK OPERATOR (\"MVNO\") RESELLER AGREEMENT WITH VERIZON.  OUR SPECTRUM MOBILE SERVICE IS OFFERED TO OUR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS SUBSCRIBING TO OUR INTERNET SERVICE AND RUNS ON VERIZON'S MOBILE NETWORK COMBINED WITH SPECTRUM WIFI.  WE BEGAN MASS MARKET ADVERTISING OF SPECTRUM MOBILE IN SEPTEMBER 2018.  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE EXPANDED OUR SPECTRUM MOBILE BRING-YOUR-OWN-DEVICE (\"BYOD\") PROGRAM ACROSS ALL SALES CHANNELS TO INCLUDE A BROADER SET OF DEVICES.  WE BELIEVE OUR BYOD PROGRAM WILL LOWER THE COST FOR CONSUMERS OF SWITCHING MOBILE CARRIERS, AND WILL REDUCE THE SHORT-TERM WORKING CAPITAL IMPACT OF SELLING NEW MOBILE DEVICES ON INSTALLMENT PLANS.  WE EXPECT THESE DEVELOPMENTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWTH OF OUR MOBILE BUSINESS.  WE ALSO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE WAYS TO MANAGE OUR OWN NETWORK AND DRIVE EVEN MORE MOBILE TRAFFIC TO OUR NETWORK THROUGH OUR CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF IN-HOME AND OUTDOOR WIFI HOTSPOTS.  IN ADDITION, WE PLAN TO USE OUR WIFI NETWORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH ADDITIONAL UNLICENSED OR LICENSED SPECTRUM TO IMPROVE NETWORK PERFORMANCE AND EXPAND CAPACITY TO OFFER CONSUMERS A SUPERIOR MOBILE SERVICE AT A LOWER TOTAL COST TO US.\u200b\u200b  FURTHER, WE HAVE EXPERIMENTAL WIRELESS LICENSES FROM THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION THAT WE ARE UTILIZING TO TEST NEXT GENERATION MOBILE SERVICES IN SEVERAL SERVICE AREAS AROUND THE COUNTRY.  IN 2018, WE INVESTED IN OUR MOBILE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP WITH COMCAST CORPORATION, WITH A PORTION REPRESENTING OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE PARTNERSHIP AND A PORTION REPRESENTING A PREPAYMENT OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED SERVICES FOR THE MOBILE BACK OFFICE PLATFORM.  AS THE PARTNERSHIP DELIVERS SERVICES, WE WILL REFLECT SUCH SERVICES AS CAPITAL OR OPERATING EXPENSE DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF SERVICES DELIVERED.  WE BELIEVE SPECTRUM-BRANDED MOBILE SERVICES WILL DRIVE HIGHER SALES OF OUR CORE PRODUCTS, CREATE LONGER CUSTOMER LIVES AND INCREASE PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOW OVER TIME.  AS A RESULT OF GROWTH COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR NEW MOBILE PRODUCT LINE, WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GROW REVENUES OR MAINTAIN OUR MARGINS AT RECENT HISTORICAL RATES.

USE OF ADJUSTED EBITDA  AND FREE CASH FLOW  WE USE CERTAIN MEASURES THAT ARE NOT DEFINED BY GAAP TO EVALUATE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS. ADJUSTED EBITDA AND FREE CASH FLOW ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHARTER SHAREHOLDERS AND NET CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THESE TERMS, AS DEFINED BY US, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. ADJUSTED EBITDA AND FREE CASH FLOW ARE RECONCILED TO NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHARTER SHAREHOLDERS AND NET CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, RESPECTIVELY, BELOW.  ADJUSTED EBITDA ELIMINATES THE SIGNIFICANT NON-CASH DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE THAT RESULTS FROM THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESSES AS WELL AS OTHER NON-CASH OR SPECIAL ITEMS, AND IS UNAFFECTED BY OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE OR INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, THIS MEASURE IS LIMITED IN THAT IT DOES NOT REFLECT THE PERIODIC COSTS OF CERTAIN CAPITALIZED TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS USED IN GENERATING REVENUES AND OUR CASH COST OF FINANCING. THESE COSTS ARE EVALUATED THROUGH OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES.  FREE CASH FLOW IS DEFINED AS NET CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, LESS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND CHANGES IN ACCRUED EXPENSES RELATED TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  MANAGEMENT AND CHARTER\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS USE ADJUSTED EBITDA AND FREE CASH FLOW TO ASSESS OUR PERFORMANCE AND OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE OUR DEBT, FUND OPERATIONS AND MAKE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS WITH INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS. IN ADDITION, ADJUSTED EBITDA GENERALLY CORRELATES TO THE LEVERAGE RATIO CALCULATION UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES OR OUTSTANDING NOTES TO DETERMINE COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS CONTAINED IN THE FACILITIES AND NOTES (ALL SUCH DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \u201cSEC\u201d)). FOR THE PURPOSE OF CALCULATING COMPLIANCE WITH LEVERAGE COVENANTS, WE USE ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS PRESENTED, EXCLUDING CERTAIN EXPENSES PAID BY OUR OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES TO OTHER CHARTER ENTITIES. OUR DEBT COVENANTS REFER TO THESE EXPENSES AS MANAGEMENT FEES, WHICH WERE  $299 MILLION  AND  $599 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  $265 MILLION  AND  $538 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

RECENT EVENTS  IN MAY 2019, CCO HOLDINGS, LLC AND CCO HOLDINGS CAPITAL CORP. JOINTLY ISSUED  $750 MILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  5.375%  SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE 2029 AT PAR AND IN JULY 2019, AN ADDITIONAL  $750 MILLION  OF THE SAME SERIES OF NOTES WERE ISSUED AT A PRICE OF  102.000%  OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. THE NET PROCEEDS WERE USED TO PAY RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING FUNDING BUYBACKS OF CHARTER CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND CHARTER HOLDINGS COMMON UNITS AS WELL AS REPAYING CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS.  IN JULY 2019, CHARTER OPERATING AND CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS OPERATING CAPITAL CORP. JOINTLY ISSUED  $1.25 BILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  5.125%  SENIOR NOTES DUE 2049 AT A PRICE OF  99.880%  OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT.  THE NET PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO PAY RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING FUNDING POTENTIAL BUYBACKS OF CHARTER CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND CHARTER HOLDINGS COMMON UNITS AS WELL AS REPAYING CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE TIME WARNER CABLE, LLC'S  5.000%  SENIOR NOTES DUE 2020.  OVERVIEW OF OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND LIQUIDITY  WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF DEBT. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR DEBT AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  WAS  $72.6 BILLION  , CONSISTING OF  $11.2 BILLION  OF CREDIT FACILITY DEBT,  $41.8 BILLION  OF INVESTMENT GRADE SENIOR SECURED NOTES AND  $19.7 BILLION  OF HIGH-YIELD SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES. OUR BUSINESS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT CASH TO FUND PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON OUR DEBT.  OUR PROJECTED CASH NEEDS AND PROJECTED SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY DEPEND UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS, AND THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF OUR EXPENDITURES. AS WE LAUNCH OUR NEW MOBILE SERVICES, WE EXPECT AN INITIAL FUNDING PERIOD TO GROW A NEW PRODUCT AS WELL AS NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL IMPACTS FROM THE TIMING OF DEVICE-RELATED CASH FLOWS WHEN WE PROVIDE THE HANDSET OR TABLET TO CUSTOMERS PURSUANT TO EQUIPMENT INSTALLMENT PLANS.  FREE CASH FLOW WAS  $1.1 BILLION  AND  $1.8 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  $804 MILLION  AND  $755 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE INCREASE IN FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR PERIODS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND HIGHER ADJUSTED EBITDA OFFSET BY AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN CASH PAID FOR INTEREST.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY  $4.1 BILLION  AND CASH ON HAND WAS APPROXIMATELY  $696 MILLION  .  WE EXPECT TO UTILIZE FREE CASH FLOW, CASH ON HAND AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AS WELL AS FUTURE REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS TO FURTHER EXTEND THE MATURITIES OF OUR OBLIGATIONS. THE TIMING AND TERMS OF ANY REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AMONG OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, AND DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, USE CASH ON HAND AND THE PROCEEDS FROM SECURITIES OFFERINGS OR OTHER BORROWINGS TO RETIRE OUR DEBT THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED PURCHASES, TENDER OFFERS OR REDEMPTION PROVISIONS. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY FROM CASH ON HAND, FREE CASH FLOW AND CHARTER OPERATING\u2019S REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AS WELL AS ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS TO FUND OUR PROJECTED CASH NEEDS.  WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF OUR CASH ON HAND AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE FREE CASH FLOW INCLUDING TO INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS GROWTH AND OTHER STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AS WELL AS STOCK REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS. CHARTER'S TARGET LEVERAGE REMAINS AT 4 TO 4.5 TIMES, AND UP TO 3.5 TIMES AT THE CHARTER OPERATING LEVEL. OUR LEVERAGE WAS 4.4 AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  .  WE EXPECT TO INCREASE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS TO MAINTAIN LEVERAGE WITHIN CHARTER'S TARGET LEVERAGE RANGE.  DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , CHARTER PURCHASED APPROXIMATELY  2.2 MILLION  AND  4.9 MILLION  SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, OF CHARTER CLASS A COMMON STOCK FOR APPROXIMATELY  $837 MILLION  AND  $1.7 BILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AND DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , CHARTER PURCHASED  5.7 MILLION  AND  7.3 MILLION  SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, OF CHARTER CLASS A COMMON STOCK FOR APPROXIMATELY  $1.7 BILLION  AND  $2.2 BILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  IN DECEMBER 2017, CHARTER AND A/N ENTERED INTO AN AMENDMENT TO THE LETTER AGREEMENT (THE \"LETTER AGREEMENT\") THAT REQUIRES A/N TO SELL TO CHARTER OR TO CHARTER HOLDINGS, ON A MONTHLY BASIS, A NUMBER OF SHARES OF CHARTER CLASS A COMMON STOCK OR CHARTER HOLDINGS COMMON UNITS THAT REPRESENTS A PRO RATA PARTICIPATION BY A/N AND ITS AFFILIATES IN ANY REPURCHASES OF SHARES OF CHARTER CLASS A COMMON STOCK FROM PERSONS OTHER THAN A/N EFFECTED BY CHARTER DURING THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING CALENDAR MONTH, AT A PURCHASE PRICE EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE PRICE PAID BY CHARTER FOR THE SHARES REPURCHASED FROM PERSONS OTHER THAN A/N DURING SUCH  40  IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING CALENDAR MONTH. A/N AND CHARTER BOTH HAVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE OR SUSPEND THE PRO RATA REPURCHASE ARRANGEMENT ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. CHARTER HOLDINGS PURCHASED FROM A/N  0.4 MILLION  AND  0.8 MILLION  CHARTER HOLDINGS COMMON UNITS AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER UNIT OF  $358.21  AND  $338.12  , OR  $161 MILLION  AND  $254 MILLION  , DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  0.7 MILLION  AND  1.1 MILLION  CHARTER HOLDINGS COMMON UNITS AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER UNIT OF  $295.31  AND  $312.38  , OR  $201 MILLION  AND  $328 MILLION  , DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , CHARTER HAD REMAINING BOARD AUTHORITY TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL  $769 MILLION  OF CHARTER\u2019S CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND/OR CHARTER HOLDINGS COMMON UNITS.  CHARTER IS NOT OBLIGATED TO ACQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR AMOUNT OF COMMON STOCK, AND THE TIMING OF ANY PURCHASES THAT MAY OCCUR CANNOT BE PREDICTED AND WILL LARGELY DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER POTENTIAL USES OF CAPITAL. PURCHASES MAY INCLUDE OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, TENDER OFFERS OR NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS.  AS POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS, SWAPS OR DISPOSITIONS ARISE, WE ACTIVELY REVIEW THEM AGAINST OUR OBJECTIVES INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, IMPROVING THE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, GEOGRAPHIC CLUSTERING OF ASSETS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT OR TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES OF OUR BUSINESS AND ACHIEVING APPROPRIATE RETURN TARGETS, AND WE MAY PARTICIPATE TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE THESE POSSIBILITIES PRESENT ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ACTUALLY COMPLETE ANY ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS OR SYSTEM SWAPS, OR THAT ANY SUCH TRANSACTIONS WILL BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS OR RESULTS.

LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTIONS  DISTRIBUTIONS BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO A PARENT COMPANY FOR PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL ON PARENT COMPANY NOTES ARE RESTRICTED UNDER INDENTURES AND CREDIT FACILITIES GOVERNING OUR INDEBTEDNESS, UNLESS THERE IS NO DEFAULT UNDER THE APPLICABLE INDENTURE AND CREDIT FACILITIES, AND UNLESS EACH APPLICABLE SUBSIDIARY\u2019S LEVERAGE RATIO TEST IS MET AT THE TIME OF SUCH DISTRIBUTION.  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , THERE WAS NO DEFAULT UNDER ANY OF THESE INDENTURES OR CREDIT FACILITIES, AND EACH SUBSIDIARY MET ITS APPLICABLE LEVERAGE RATIO TESTS BASED ON  JUNE 30, 2019  FINANCIAL RESULTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THEY WILL SATISFY THESE TESTS AT THE TIME OF THE CONTEMPLATED DISTRIBUTION. DISTRIBUTIONS BY CHARTER OPERATING FOR PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL ON PARENT COMPANY NOTES ARE FURTHER RESTRICTED BY THE COVENANTS IN ITS CREDIT FACILITIES.

NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED  $348 MILLION  DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, EXCLUDING THE CHANGE IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND ACCRUED EXPENSES RELATED TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, THAT USED $578 MILLION MORE CASH AS A RESULT OF A ONE-TIME IMPACT FROM A STANDARDIZATION OF BILL CYCLES AND LOWER PAYABLES OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EBITDA OF  $296 MILLION.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $3.7 BILLION  AND  $5.1 BILLION  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

THE INCREASE IN CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT BY WHICH BORROWINGS OF LONG-TERM DEBT EXCEEDED REPAYMENTS OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE PURCHASE OF TREASURY STOCK AND NONCONTROLLING INTEREST.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT ONGOING CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE  $1.6 BILLION  AND  $3.3 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  $2.4 BILLION  AND  $4.6 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CUSTOMER PREMISE EQUIPMENT EXPENDITURES AS A RESULT OF THE COMPLETION OF OUR ALL-DIGITAL CONVERSION AND FEWER SPP MIGRATIONS, LOWER SCALABLE INFRASTRUCTURE AS A RESULT OF THE COMPLETION OF THE ROLL-OUT OF DOCSIS 3.1 TECHNOLOGY ACROSS OUR FOOTPRINT IN 2018 AND LOWER SUPPORT SPENDING WITH THE SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION OF THE INTEGRATION OF TWC AND BRIGHT HOUSE.  SEE THE TABLE BELOW FOR MORE DETAILS.  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EXCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO MOBILE, TO BE APPROXIMATELY $7 BILLION IN 2019, VERSUS $8.9 BILLION IN 2018.  THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2019 WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING FURTHER SPEND RELATED TO PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH RATES OF BOTH OUR RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES.

WE EXPECT FULL-YEAR  2019  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $3.7 BILLION  . WE EXPECT TO FUND  2019  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES PRIMARILY WITH INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS AND ADDITIONAL DEBT FINANCING.  FINANCING AND OTHER FUNDING TRANSACTIONS  WE UTILIZE EXTERNAL CAPITAL PRIMARILY TO SUPPORT WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND GROWTH IN OUR ASSET-BASED PRODUCT LINES. THE VARIETY OF DEBT FINANCING ALTERNATIVES TYPICALLY AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR CAPITAL NEEDS INCLUDE COMMERCIAL PAPER, LONG-TERM AND MEDIUM-TERM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DEBT, ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, BANK TERM LOANS, LEASING ARRANGEMENTS AND BANK CREDIT FACILITIES. OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF FINANCING ARE ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND MEDIUM-TERM NOTES.  OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS UNSECURED DEBT IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS IS IMPACTED BY BOTH OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS. THESE RATINGS ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO INVESTORS IN DETERMINING THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PARTICULAR SECURITIES BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION OBTAINED BY THE RATING AGENCIES FROM US OR FROM OTHER SOURCES. LOWER RATINGS GENERALLY RESULT IN HIGHER BORROWING COSTS, AS WELL AS REDUCED ACCESS TO UNSECURED CAPITAL MARKETS. A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE OF OUR SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS WOULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LIKELY REQUIRE US TO RELY ON ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES. A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE WOULD NOT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO BORROW AMOUNTS UNDER OUR GLOBAL REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DESCRIBED BELOW, ASSUMING ONGOING COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY.  OUR DEBT RATINGS AND RATING OUTLOOKS AT  JUNE 30, 2019  WERE AS FOLLOWS.

IF WE DECIDE TO REPATRIATE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD OUTSIDE THE U.S., WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES. HOWEVER, OUR INTENT IS TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST THESE FOREIGN AMOUNTS OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND OUR CURRENT PLANS DO NOT DEMONSTRATE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THESE FOREIGN AMOUNTS TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS, TOGETHER WITH OUR ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC UNSECURED BOND MARKET, COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AND OTHER AVAILABLE DEBT FINANCING, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING NEEDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT UNANTICIPATED VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION IN THE PUBLIC UNSECURED DEBT MARKET OR THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET WOULD NOT IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THESE MARKETS ON TERMS COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TO US OR AT ALL. IF WE CEASE TO HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC BONDS, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER SOURCES OF UNSECURED BORROWINGS, WE WOULD MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS BY DRAWING UPON CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED LENDING AGREEMENTS AND/OR BY SEEKING OTHER FUNDING SOURCES.

WE UTILIZE BOTH FIXED-RATE AND VARIABLE-RATE DEBT TO ACHIEVE THIS ALIGNMENT AND GENERALLY TARGET A MIX OF 20% - 40% VARIABLE-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING. THE VARIABLE-RATE PORTION OF OUR TOTAL DEBT (INCLUDING NOTIONAL VALUE OF SWAP AGREEMENTS) WAS  22%  AND  28%  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

PENSION INFORMATION  THE FUNDED STATUS OF OUR PENSION PLANS IS DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING RETURNS ON INVESTED ASSETS AND THE LEVEL OF CERTAIN MARKET INTEREST RATES. WE REVIEW PENSION ASSUMPTIONS REGULARLY AND WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, MAKE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLANS, WHICH EXCEED THE AMOUNTS REQUIRED BY STATUTE. IN  2019  , THE EXPECTED TOTAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLANS ARE APPROXIMATELY $34 MILLION  . DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  , WE CONTRIBUTED  $16 MILLION  TO OUR PENSION PLANS. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES HELD BY THE PLANS DURING  2019  COULD MATERIALLY CHANGE, POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY, THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PLANS AND AFFECT THE LEVEL OF PENSION EXPENSE AND CONTRIBUTIONS IN  2019  AND BEYOND.

SEE RECONCILIATIONS FOR EACH OF THESE MEASURES FOLLOWING THIS TABLE.  OPERATING REVENUE MEASURES  .  OPERATING REVENUE  FMS OPERATING REVENUE  DTS OPERATING REVENUE  SCS OPERATING REVENUE  FMS EBT AS A % OF FMS OPERATING REVENUE  DTS EBT AS A % OF DTS OPERATING REVENUE  SCS EBT AS A % OF SCS OPERATING REVENUE  OPERATING REVENUE IS DEFINED AS TOTAL REVENUE FOR RYDER SYSTEM, INC. OR EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT (FMS, DTS AND SCS), RESPECTIVELY, EXCLUDING ANY (1) FUEL AND (2) SUBCONTRACTED TRANSPORTATION. WE BELIEVE OPERATING REVENUE PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS AS WE USE IT TO EVALUATE THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR CORE BUSINESSES AND AS A MEASURE OF SALES ACTIVITY AT THE CONSOLIDATED LEVEL FOR RYDER SYSTEM, INC., AS WELL AS FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  WE ALSO USE SEGMENT EBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUE FOR EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT FOR THE SAME REASON. NOTE: FMS EBT, DTS EBT AND SCS EBT, OUR PRIMARY MEASURES OF SEGMENT PERFORMANCE, ARE NOT NON-GAAP MEASURES.  FUEL  :  WE EXCLUDE FMS, DTS AND SCS FUEL FROM THE CALCULATION OF OUR OPERATING REVENUE MEASURES, AS FUEL IS AN ANCILLARY SERVICE THAT WE PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH IS IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET FUEL PRICES, AND THE COSTS ARE LARGELY A PASS-THROUGH TO OUR CUSTOMERS, RESULTING IN MINIMAL CHANGES IN OUR PROFITABILITY DURING PERIODS OF STEADY MARKET FUEL PRICES. HOWEVER, PROFITABILITY MAY BE POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY RAPID CHANGES IN MARKET FUEL PRICES DURING A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, AS CUSTOMER PRICING FOR FUEL SERVICES IS ESTABLISHED BASED ON TRAILING MARKET FUEL COSTS.  SUBCONTRACTED TRANSPORTATION  :  WE ALSO EXCLUDE SUBCONTRACTED TRANSPORTATION FROM THE CALCULATION OF OUR OPERATING REVENUE MEASURES, AS THESE SERVICES ARE ALSO TYPICALLY A PASS-THROUGH TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, FLUCTUATIONS RESULT IN MINIMAL CHANGES TO OUR PROFITABILITY. WHILE OUR DTS AND SCS BUSINESS SEGMENTS SUBCONTRACT CERTAIN TRANSPORTATION SERVICES TO THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, OUR FMS BUSINESS SEGMENT DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SUBCONTRACTED TRANSPORTATION AND, THEREFORE, THIS ITEM IS NOT APPLICABLE TO FMS.  COMPARABLE EARNINGS MEASURES  .  COMPARABLE EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAX (EBT)  COMPARABLE EARNINGS  COMPARABLE EARNINGS PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE (EPS)  COMPARABLE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  COMPARABLE EBT, COMPARABLE EARNINGS, COMPARABLE EPS AND COMPARABLE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES ARE DEFINED, RESPECTIVELY, AS GAAP EBT, EARNINGS, EPS AND PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, ALL FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING (1) NON-OPERATING PENSION COSTS AND (2) ANY OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS THAT ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THESE COMPARABLE EARNINGS MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS AND ALLOW FOR BETTER YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  NON-OPERATING PENSION COSTS  :  OUR COMPARABLE EARNINGS MEASURES EXCLUDE NON-OPERATING PENSION COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE THE AMORTIZATION OF NET ACTUARIAL LOSS AND PRIOR SERVICE COST, INTEREST COST AND EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS COMPONENTS OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS. WE EXCLUDE NON-OPERATING PENSION COSTS BECAUSE WE CONSIDER THESE TO BE IMPACTED BY FINANCIAL MARKET PERFORMANCE AND OUTSIDE THE OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS.  OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS  : OUR COMPARABLE EARNINGS MEASURES ALSO EXCLUDE OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS THAT ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AS DETAILED IN THE RECONCILIATION TABLE BELOW - PAGE 57. THESE OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND, IN SOME PERIODS, THERE MAY BE NO SUCH SIGNIFICANT ITEMS.  CALCULATION OF COMPARABLE TAX RATE  :  THE COMPARABLE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING THE SAME METHODOLOGY AS THE GAAP PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON THE STATUTORY TAX RATES OF THE JURISDICTIONS TO WHICH THE NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS RELATE.  55  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2014 (CONTINUED)  CASH FLOW MEASURES  .  TOTAL CASH GENERATED  FREE CASH FLOW  WE CONSIDER TOTAL CASH GENERATED AND FREE CASH FLOW TO BE IMPORTANT MEASURES OF COMPARATIVE OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AS OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF OPERATING LIQUIDITY ARE CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF REVENUE EARNING EQUIPMENT.  TOTAL CASH GENERATED  :  TOTAL CASH GENERATED IS DEFINED AS THE SUM OF (1) NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, (2) NET CASH PROVIDED BY THE SALE OF REVENUE EARNING EQUIPMENT, (3) NET CASH PROVIDED BY THE SALE OF OPERATING PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND (4) OTHER CASH INFLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES. WE BELIEVE TOTAL CASH GENERATED IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE OF TOTAL CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OUR ONGOING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.  FREE CASH FLOW  : WE REFER TO THE NET AMOUNT OF CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES (EXCLUDING ACQUISITIONS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AS \u201cFREE CASH FLOW\u201d. WE CALCULATE FREE CASH FLOW AS THE SUM OF (1) NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, (2) NET CASH PROVIDED BY THE SALE OF REVENUE EARNING EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, (3) OTHER CASH INFLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES, LESS (4) PURCHASES OF PROPERTY AND REVENUE EARNING EQUIPMENT. WE BELIEVE FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH AN IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE ON THE CASH AVAILABLE FOR DEBT SERVICE AND FOR SHAREHOLDERS, AFTER MAKING CAPITAL INVESTMENTS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS. OUR CALCULATION OF FREE CASH FLOW MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE CALCULATION USED BY OTHER COMPANIES AND, THEREFORE, COMPARABILITY MAY BE LIMITED.  * SEE TOTAL CASH GENERATED AND FREE CASH FLOW RECONCILIATIONS IN THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY SECTION OF MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  56  ITEM 2.

STATEMENTS EXPRESSING OUR ASSESSMENTS OF THE GROWTH POTENTIAL OF THE ALBANY ENGINEERED COMPOSITES SEGMENT ARE NOT INTENDED AS FORECASTS OF ACTUAL FUTURE GROWTH, AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON AS SUCH. WHILE WE BELIEVE SUCH ASSESSMENTS TO HAVE A REASONABLE BASIS, SUCH ASSESSMENTS ARE, BY THEIR NATURE, INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. THIS REPORT SETS FORTH A NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THESE ASSESSMENTS, INCLUDING PROJECTED TIMING AND VOLUME OF DEMAND FOR AIRCRAFT AND FOR LEAP AIRCRAFT ENGINES. SUCH ASSUMPTIONS COULD PROVE INCORRECT. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE EXPECTATIONS REFLECTED IN OUR OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO FORESEE OR IDENTIFY ALL FACTORS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL AND NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS REPORT ARE MADE ON THE BASIS OF OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ANALYSES, AS OF THE TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE, IN LIGHT OF OUR EXPERIENCE AND PERCEPTION OF HISTORICAL CONDITIONS, EXPECTED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, AND OTHER FACTORS BELIEVED TO BE APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.  EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, WE DISCLAIM ANY OBLIGATIONS OR UNDERTAKING TO PUBLICLY RELEASE ANY UPDATES OR REVISIONS TO ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT CONTAINED OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS REPORT TO REFLECT ANY CHANGE IN OUR EXPECTATIONS WITH REGARD THERETO OR ANY CHANGE IN EVENTS, CONDITIONS OR CIRCUMSTANCES ON WHICH ANY SUCH STATEMENT IS BASED.  BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW AND TRENDS  OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, MACHINE CLOTHING (MC) AND ALBANY ENGINEERED COMPOSITES (AEC), DRAW ON THE SAME ADVANCED TEXTILES AND MATERIALS PROCESSING CAPABILITIES, AND COMPETE ON THE BASIS OF PRODUCT-BASED ADVANTAGE THAT IS GROUNDED IN THOSE CORE CAPABILITIES.  THE MC SEGMENT IS THE COMPANY\u2019S LONG-ESTABLISHED CORE BUSINESS AND PRIMARY GENERATOR OF CASH. WHILE IT HAS SUFFERED FROM WELL-DOCUMENTED DECLINES IN PUBLICATION GRADES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S TRADITIONAL MARKETS, THE PAPER AND PAPERBOARD INDUSTRY IS STILL EXPECTED TO GROW SLIGHTLY ON A GLOBAL BASIS, DRIVEN BY DEMAND FOR PACKAGING AND TISSUE GRADES, AS WELL AS THE EXPANSION OF PAPER CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION IN ASIA AND SOUTH AMERICA. WE FEEL WE ARE NOW WELL-POSITIONED IN KEY MARKETS, WITH HIGH-QUALITY, LOW-COST PRODUCTION IN GROWTH MARKETS, SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER FIXED COSTS IN MATURE MARKETS, AND CONTINUED STRENGTH IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, TECHNICAL PRODUCT SUPPORT, AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY. BECAUSE OF PRICING PRESSURES AND INDUSTRY OVERCAPACITY, THE MACHINE CLOTHING AND PAPER INDUSTRIES WILL CONTINUE TO FACE TOP LINE PRESSURE. DESPITE CONTINUED MARKET PRESSURE ON REVENUE, THE BUSINESS RETAINS THE POTENTIAL FOR MAINTAINING STABLE EARNINGS IN THE FUTURE. IT HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT GENERATOR OF CASH, AND WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN THE CASH-GENERATING POTENTIAL OF THIS BUSINESS BY MAINTAINING THE LOW COSTS THAT WE ACHIEVED THROUGH CONTINUOUS FOCUS ON COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES, AND COMPETING VIGOROUSLY BY USING OUR DIFFERENTIATED AND TECHNICALLY SUPERIOR PRODUCTS TO REDUCE OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 TOTAL COST OF OPERATION AND IMPROVE THEIR PAPER QUALITY.  THE AEC SEGMENT PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT GROWTH POTENTIAL FOR OUR COMPANY BOTH NEAR AND LONG TERM. OUR STRATEGY IS TO GROW BY FOCUSING OUR PROPRIETARY 3D-WOVEN TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS OUR NON-3D TECHNOLOGY CAPABILITIES, ON HIGH-VALUE AEROSPACE (BOTH COMMERCIAL AND DEFENSE) APPLICATIONS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PERFORMING SUCCESSFULLY ON OUR PORTFOLIO OF GROWTH PROGRAMS. AEC (INCLUDING ALBANY SAFRAN COMPOSITES, LLC (ASC), IN WHICH OUR CUSTOMER SAFRAN GROUP OWNS A 10 PERCENT NONCONTROLLING INTEREST) SUPPLIES A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS IN THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. AEC\u2019S LARGEST AEROSPACE CUSTOMER IS THE SAFRAN GROUP AND SALES TO SAFRAN, THROUGH ASC, (CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF FAN BLADES AND CASES FOR CFM\u2019S LEAP ENGINE) ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 19 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IN 2018. AEC, THROUGH ASC, ALSO SUPPLIES 3D-WOVEN COMPOSITE FAN CASES FOR THE GE9X ENGINE. AEC\u2019S CURRENT PORTFOLIO OF NON-3D PROGRAMS INCLUDES COMPONENTS FOR THE F-35, FUSELAGE COMPONENTS FOR THE BOEING 787, COMPONENTS FOR THE CH-53K HELICOPTER, VACUUM WASTE TANKS FOR BOEING 7-SERIES AIRCRAFT, AND MISSILE BODIES FOR LOCKHEED MARTIN\u2019S JASSM AIR-TO-SURFACE MISSILES. AEC IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN RESEARCH TO DEVELOP NEW APPLICATIONS IN BOTH COMMERCIAL AND DEFENSE AIRCRAFT ENGINE AND AIRFRAME MARKETS. IN 2018, APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT OF AEC SALES WERE RELATED TO U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS OR PROGRAMS.  32  INDEX  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NET SALES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR NET SALES BY BUSINESS SEGMENT.

GROSS PROFIT  THREE MONTH COMPARISON  \u2022  THE INCREASE IN MC GROSS PROFIT WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO IMPROVED LABOR PRODUCTIVITY AND LOWER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET SALES WHICH RESULTS IN REDUCED FIXED COST LEVERAGE.  \u2022  CHANGES IN CURRENCY TRANSLATION RATES DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON GROSS PROFIT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.  38  INDEX  SIX MONTH COMPARISON  \u2022  THE INCREASE IN MC GROSS PROFIT WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO IMPROVED LABOR PRODUCTIVITY AND LOWER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.  \u2022  CHANGES IN CURRENCY TRANSLATION RATES DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON YEAR-TO-DATE GROSS PROFIT IN 2019.  OPERATING INCOME  THREE MONTH COMPARISON  THE DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE NET EFFECT OF THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ITEMS.  \u2022  STG&R EXPENSES INCREASED $2.9 MILLION PRINCIPALLY DUE TO REVALUATION OF NONFUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTED IN SECOND-QUARTER LOSSES OF $0.3 MILLION IN 2019, AND GAINS OF $2.3 MILLION IN 2018. THE INCREASE IN STG&R EXPENSES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT AND A DECREASE IN RESTRUCTURING EXPENSE.  \u2022  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES WERE $1.0 MILLION IN THE SECOND-QUARTER OF 2019, COMPARED TO $1.8 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  SIX MONTH COMPARISON  THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE NET EFFECT OF THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ITEMS.  \u2022  GROSS PROFIT INCREASED $5.1 MILLION DUE TO IMPROVED LABOR PRODUCTIVITY.  \u2022  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES WERE $1.4 MILLION IN 2019, COMPARED TO $10.2 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  ALBANY ENGINEERED COMPOSITES SEGMENT  THE AEC SEGMENT, INCLUDING ALBANY SAFRAN COMPOSITES, LLC (ASC), IN WHICH OUR CUSTOMER, THE SAFRAN GROUP, OWNS A 10 PERCENT NONCONTROLLING INTEREST, PROVIDES HIGHLY ENGINEERED ADVANCED COMPOSITE STRUCTURES TO CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY IN THE AEROSPACE (BOTH COMMERCIAL AND DEFENSE) INDUSTRY. AEC\u2019S LARGEST PROGRAM RELATES TO CFM INTERNATIONAL\u2019S LEAP ENGINE. AEC, THROUGH ASC, IS THE EXCLUSIVE SUPPLIER OF ADVANCED COMPOSITE FAN BLADES AND CASES FOR THIS PROGRAM UNDER A LONG-TERM SUPPLY CONTRACT. LEAP ENGINES ARE CURRENTLY USED ON THE BOEING 737 MAX, AIRBUS A320NEO AND COMAC AIRCRAFT. OTHER SIGNIFICANT AEC PROGRAMS INCLUDE COMPONENTS FOR THE F-35, FUSELAGE FRAMES FOR THE BOEING 787, COMPONENTS FOR THE CH53-K HELICOPTER, AND THE FAN CASE FOR THE GE9X ENGINE.  A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, HAVE ISSUED ORDERS GROUNDING BOEING 737 MAX 8 AND/OR MAX 9 AIRCRAFT. IF THESE RECENT GROUNDINGS CAUSE A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR, OR PRODUCTION OF, THIS AIRCRAFT, IT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON DEMAND FOR THE LEAP 1B ENGINE VARIANT, WHICH COULD IN TURN HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON DEMAND FOR THE PARTS WE SUPPLY FOR SUCH ENGINE. SUCH GROUNDINGS ARE ALSO LIKELY TO RESULT IN NEAR-TERM DELAYS OR INTERRUPTIONS IN PLANNED PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF THE COMPONENTS THAT WE SUPPLY FOR SUCH ENGINE VARIANT; SUCH INTERRUPTIONS OR DELAYS WOULD LIKELY REDUCE AEC\u2019S LEAP-RELATED SALES AND EARNINGS IN THE PERIODS IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

GROSS PROFIT  THREE MONTH COMPARISON  THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT OF $12.3 MILLION WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN NET SALES, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IMPROVED LABOR PRODUCTIVITY, AND THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED PROFITABILITY OF LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WHICH INCREASED GROSS PROFIT BY $5.0 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, COMPARED TO A DECREASE OF $1.6 MILLION IN 2018.  SIX MONTH COMPARISON  THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT OF $18.0 MILLION WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN NET SALES, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IMPROVED LABOR PRODUCTIVITY, AND THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED PROFITABILITY OF LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WHICH INCREASED GROSS PROFIT BY $5.6 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, COMPARED TO A DECREASE OF $1.6 MILLION IN 2018.  LONG-TERM CONTRACTS  AEC HAS CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING ITS CONTRACT FOR THE LEAP PROGRAM, WHERE REVENUE IS DETERMINED BY A COST-PLUS FEE AGREEMENT. REVENUE EARNED UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT OF SEGMENT REVENUE FOR EACH OF THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 AND 2018.  IN ADDITION, AEC HAS LONG-TERM CONTRACTS IN WHICH THE SELLING PRICE IS FIXED. IN ACCOUNTING FOR THOSE CONTRACTS, WE ESTIMATE THE PROFIT MARGIN EXPECTED AT THE COMPLETION OF THE CONTRACT AND RECOGNIZE A PRO-RATA SHARE OF THAT PROFIT DURING THE COURSE OF THE CONTRACT USING A COST-TO-COST APPROACH. CHANGES IN ESTIMATED CONTRACT PROFITABILITY WILL AFFECT REVENUE AND GROSS PROFIT WHEN THE CHANGE OCCURS, WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE EFFECT ON REVENUE AND GROSS PROFIT IN ANY REPORTING PERIOD.  CHANGES IN CONTRACT ESTIMATES RESULTED IN AN INCREASE TO GROSS PROFIT OF $5.6 MILLION IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, COMPARED TO A DECREASE TO GROSS PROFIT OF $1.6 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018.  OPERATING INCOME/(LOSS)  THREE MONTH COMPARISON  THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME OF $13.6 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE NET EFFECT OF THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ITEMS.  \u2022  A $12.3 MILLION INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  \u2022  A $0.8 MILLION DECREASE IN STG&R EXPENSES, DUE TO LOWER COMPENSATION AND PROFESSIONAL FEES IN 2019.  40  INDEX  SIX MONTH COMPARISON  THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME OF $20.9 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE NET EFFECT OF THE FOLLOWING INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT ITEMS.  \u2022  A $18 MILLION INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  \u2022  A $2.2 MILLION DECREASE IN STG&R EXPENSES, DUE TO LOWER COMPENSATION AND PROFESSIONAL FEES IN 2019.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $83.1 MILLION AND $16.7 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE NET INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2019 WAS DUE TO INCREASED PROFITABILITY IN BOTH MC AND AEC, AND IMPROVED MANAGEMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL THAT RESULTED FROM A NUMBER OF IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES.  CASH PAID FOR INCOME TAXES WAS $17.4 MILLION AND $14.0 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN WITHHOLDING TAXES PAID ON BEHALF OF SWITZERLAND RELATED TO DIVIDEND PAYMENTS MADE TO SWITZERLAND AND AN INCREASE IN CORPORATE INCOME TAX PAYMENTS DUE TO INCREASED PRE-TAX INCOME IN MEXICO AND AN INCREASE IN STATE CORPORATE INCOME TAX PAYMENTS IN 2019 IN THE US.  AT JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD $215.2 MILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, OF WHICH $157.7 MILLION WAS HELD BY SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.  INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS WERE $35.5 MILLION IN 2019 AND $39.2 MILLION IN 2018.  DIVIDENDS HAVE BEEN DECLARED EACH QUARTER SINCE THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001. DECISIONS WITH RESPECT TO WHETHER A DIVIDEND WILL BE PAID, AND THE AMOUNT OF THE DIVIDEND, ARE MADE BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EACH QUARTER. TO THE EXTENT, THE BOARD DECLARES CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, WE EXPECT TO PAY SUCH DIVIDENDS OUT OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS. FUTURE CASH DIVIDENDS WILL ALSO DEPEND ON DEBT COVENANTS AND ON THE BOARD\u2019S ASSESSMENT OF OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE FINANCE OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY WITH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS, LARGELY THROUGH OUR REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT AS DISCUSSED BELOW. OUR SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES MAY ALSO MAINTAIN WORKING CAPITAL LINES WITH LOCAL BANKS, BUT BORROWINGS UNDER SUCH LOCAL FACILITIES TEND NOT  41  INDEX  TO BE SIGNIFICANT. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CASH BALANCE AT JUNE 30, 2019 WAS HELD BY NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. BASED ON CASH ON HAND AND CREDIT FACILITIES, WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE COMPANY HAS SUFFICIENT CAPITAL RESOURCES TO OPERATE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL DEBT COVENANTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2019.  ON NOVEMBER 7, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A $685 MILLION UNSECURED FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WHICH AMENDED AND RESTATED THE PRIOR $550 MILLION AGREEMENT, ENTERED INTO ON APRIL 8, 2016 (THE \u201cPRIOR AGREEMENT\u201d). UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, $482 MILLION OF BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF JUNE 30, 2019. THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE FOR BORROWINGS WAS LIBOR PLUS A SPREAD, BASED ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO AT THE TIME OF BORROWING. AT THE TIME OF THE LAST BORROWING ON JUNE 17, 2019, THE SPREAD WAS 1.375%. THE SPREAD WAS BASED ON A PRICING GRID, WHICH RANGED FROM 1.250% TO 1.750%, BASED ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO. BASED ON OUR MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO AND OUR CONSOLIDATED EBITDA, AND WITHOUT MODIFICATION TO ANY OTHER CREDIT AGREEMENTS, AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BORROW AN ADDITIONAL $203 MILLION UNDER THE AGREEMENT.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAVE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED PURSUANT TO ITEM 303(A)(4) OF REGULATION S-K.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  THE INFORMATION SET FORTH UNDER NOTE 19 CONTAINED IN ITEM 1, \u201cNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u201d, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  NON-GAAP MEASURES  THIS FORM 10-Q CONTAINS CERTAIN NON-GAAP MEASURES, INCLUDING: NET SALES, AND PERCENT CHANGE IN NET SALES, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION EFFECTS (FOR EACH SEGMENT AND ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS); EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA (FOR EACH SEGMENT AND ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS REPRESENTED IN DOLLARS OR AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES); NET DEBT AND CHANGES IN NET DEBT EXCLUDING REDUCTIONS IN BOTH DUE TO THE EFFECT OF CHANGES TO THE TREATMENT OF LEASES DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF ASC 842; AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (OR ADJUSTED EPS). SUCH ITEMS ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THEY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS REGARDING THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE.  PRESENTING NET SALES AND INCREASES OR DECREASES IN NET SALES, AFTER CURRENCY EFFECTS ARE EXCLUDED, CAN GIVE MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS INSIGHT INTO UNDERLYING SALES TRENDS. NET SALES, OR PERCENT CHANGES IN NET SALES, EXCLUDING CURRENCY RATE EFFECTS, ARE CALCULATED BY CONVERTING AMOUNTS REPORTED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT THE EXCHANGE RATE OF A PRIOR PERIOD. THESE AMOUNTS ARE THEN COMPARED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNT AS REPORTED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EPS ARE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT RELATE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTINUING OPERATIONS. EBITDA, OR NET INCOME WITH INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION ADDED BACK, IS A COMMON INDICATOR OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE USED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO ANALYZE AND COMPARE CORE PROFITABILITY BETWEEN COMPANIES AND INDUSTRIES BECAUSE IT ELIMINATES EFFECTS DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN FINANCING, ASSET BASES AND TAXES. THE COMPANY CALCULATES EBITDA BY REMOVING THE FOLLOWING FROM NET INCOME: INTEREST EXPENSE NET, INCOME TAX EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CALCULATED BY: ADDING TO EBITDA COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRUCTURING, AND INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH DISCONTINUED BUSINESSES; CHARGES AND CREDITS RELATED TO PENSION PLAN SETTLEMENTS; ADDING (OR SUBTRACTING) REVALUATION LOSSES (OR GAINS); SUBTRACTING (OR ADDING) GAINS (OR LOSSES) FROM THE SALE OF BUILDINGS OR INVESTMENTS; SUBTRACTING INSURANCE RECOVERY GAINS IN EXCESS OF PREVIOUSLY RECORDED LOSSES; AND SUBTRACTING (OR ADDING) INCOME (OR LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IN ALBANY SAFRAN COMPOSITES (ASC). ADJUSTED EBITDA MAY ALSO BE PRESENTED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES BY DIVIDING IT BY NET SALES. AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT IN A PARTICULAR QUARTER OF SPECIFIC RESTRUCTURING COSTS, CURRENCY REVALUATION, INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH DISCONTINUED BUSINESSES, OR OTHER GAINS AND LOSSES, ON NET INCOME (ABSOLUTE AS WELL AS ON A PER-SHARE BASIS), OPERATING INCOME OR EBITDA CAN GIVE MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS ADDITIONAL INSIGHT INTO CORE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED TO QUARTERS IN WHICH SUCH ITEMS HAD A GREATER OR LESSER EFFECT, OR NO EFFECT. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES IN THE MC SEGMENT, WHILE FREQUENT IN RECENT YEARS, ARE REFLECTIVE OF SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN MANUFACTURING CAPACITY AND ASSOCIATED  42  INDEX  HEADCOUNT IN RESPONSE TO SHIFTING MARKETS, AND NOT OF THE PROFITABILITY OF THE BUSINESS GOING FORWARD AS RESTRUCTURED. ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (ADJUSTED EPS) IS CALCULATED BY ADDING TO (OR SUBTRACTING FROM) NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY PER SHARE, ON AN AFTER-TAX BASIS: RESTRUCTURING CHARGES; CHARGES AND CREDITS RELATED TO PENSION PLAN SETTLEMENTS AND CURTAILMENTS; INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH DISCONTINUED BUSINESSES; FOREIGN CURRENCY REVALUATION LOSSES (OR GAINS); ACQUISITION EXPENSES; AND LOSSES (OR GAINS) FROM THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS.  EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AND ADJUSTED EPS, AS DEFINED BY THE COMPANY, MAY NOT BE SIMILAR TO SIMILARLY NAMED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. SUCH MEASURES ARE NOT CONSIDERED MEASUREMENTS UNDER GAAP, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, BUT NOT AS SUBSTITUTES FOR, THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OUR FISCAL YEAR, WHICH ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY OF NOVEMBER, PERIODICALLY RESULTS IN A 53-WEEK YEAR INSTEAD OF THE NORMAL 52 WEEKS.  THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR ENDING NOVEMBER 30,  201  9  IS A 53-WEEK YEAR, WITH THE ADDITIONAL WEEK BEING INCLUDED IN OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER.  ACCORDINGLY, THE INFORMATION PRESENTED BELOW INCLUDES  27  WEEKS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE  SIX MONTHS  ENDED  JUNE 1  , 201  9  AS COMPARED  TO  26  WEEKS INCLUDED IN THE  SIX MONTHS  ENDED  MAY 26  , 201  8.  OVERVIEW  BASSETT IS A LEADING RETAILER, MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF BRANDED HOME FURNISHINGS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRIMARILY THROUGH A NETWORK OF COMPANY-OWNED AND LICENSEE-OWNED BRANDED STORES UNDER THE BASSETT HOME FURNISHINGS (\u201cBHF\u201d) NAME, WITH ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION THROUGH OTHER WHOLESALE CHANNELS INCLUDING MULTI-LINE FURNITURE STORES, MANY OF WHICH FEATURE BASSETT GALLERIES OR DESIGN CENTERS. WE WERE FOUNDED IN 1902 AND INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF VIRGINIA IN 1930. OUR RICH 117-YEAR HISTORY HAS INSTILLED THE PRINCIPLES OF QUALITY, VALUE, AND INTEGRITY IN EVERYTHING WE DO, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVIDING US WITH THE EXPERTISE TO RESPOND TO EVER-CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES AND MEET THE DEMANDS OF A GLOBAL ECONOMY.  WITH 103 BHF STORES AT JUNE 1, 2019 WE HAVE LEVERAGED OUR STRONG BRAND NAME IN FURNITURE INTO A NETWORK OF COMPANY-OWNED AND LICENSED STORES THAT FOCUS ON PROVIDING CONSUMERS WITH A FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT FOR BUYING FURNITURE AND ACCESSORIES.  OUR STORE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SINGLE SOURCE HOME FURNISHINGS RETAIL STORE THAT PROVIDES A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF STYLISH, QUALITY FURNITURE AND ACCESSORIES WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.  IN ORDER TO REACH MARKETS THAT CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY SERVED BY OUR RETAIL STORE NETWORK, WE ALSO DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH OTHER WHOLESALE CHANNELS INCLUDING MULTI-LINE FURNITURE STORES, MANY OF WHICH FEATURE BASSETT GALLERIES OR DESIGN CENTERS. WE USE A NETWORK OF OVER 30 INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHO HAVE STATED GEOGRAPHICAL TERRITORIES. THESE SALES REPRESENTATIVES ARE COMPENSATED BASED ON A STANDARD COMMISSION RATE. WE BELIEVE THIS BLENDED STRATEGY PROVIDES US THE GREATEST ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND ULTIMATELY GAIN MARKET SHARE.  THE BHF STORES FEATURE CUSTOM ORDER FURNITURE, FREE IN-HOME DESIGN VISITS (\u201cHOME MAKEOVERS\u201d), AND COORDINATED DECORATING ACCESSORIES.  OUR PHILOSOPHY IS BASED ON BUILDING STRONG LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH CUSTOMER.  SALES PEOPLE ARE REFERRED TO AS \u201cDESIGN CONSULTANTS\u201d AND ARE TRAINED TO EVALUATE CUSTOMER NEEDS AND PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THEIR HOME DECOR.  UNTIL A RIGOROUS TRAINING AND DESIGN CERTIFICATION PROGRAM IS COMPLETED, DESIGN CONSULTANTS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO PERFORM IN-HOME DESIGN SERVICES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.  WE HAVE FACTORIES IN NEWTON, NORTH CAROLINA AND GRAND PRAIRIE, TEXAS THAT MANUFACTURE CUSTOM UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE, A FACTORY IN MARTINSVILLE, VIRGINIA THAT PRIMARILY ASSEMBLES AND FINISHES OUR CUSTOM CASUAL DINING OFFERINGS AND A FACTORY IN BASSETT, VIRGINIA THAT ASSEMBLES AND FINISHES OUR \u201cBENCH MADE\u201d LINE OF CUSTOM, SOLID HARDWOOD FURNITURE. OUR MANUFACTURING TEAM TAKES GREAT PRIDE IN THE BREADTH OF ITS OPTIONS, THE PRECISION OF ITS CRAFTSMANSHIP, AND THE SPEED OF ITS PROCESS, WITH CUSTOM PIECES OFTEN MANUFACTURED WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF TAKING THE ORDER IN OUR STORES. OUR LOGISTICS TEAM THEN PROMPTLY SHIPS THE PRODUCT TO ONE OF OUR HOME DELIVERY HUBS OR TO A LOCATION SPECIFIED BY OUR LICENSEES.  IN ADDITION TO THE FURNITURE THAT WE MANUFACTURE DOMESTICALLY, WE SOURCE MOST OF OUR FORMAL BEDROOM AND DINING ROOM FURNITURE (CASEGOODS) AND CERTAIN LEATHER UPHOLSTERY OFFERINGS FROM SEVERAL FOREIGN PLANTS, PRIMARILY IN VIETNAM AND CHINA. OVER 70% OF THE PRODUCTS WE CURRENTLY SELL ARE MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES.  WE ALSO OWN ZENITH FREIGHT LINES, LLC (\u201cZENITH\u201d) WHICH PROVIDES LOGISTICAL SERVICES TO BASSETT ALONG WITH OTHER FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS. ZENITH DELIVERS BEST-OF-CLASS SHIPPING AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ARE UNIQUELY TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF BASSETT AND THE FURNITURE INDUSTRY. OVER 60% OF ZENITH\u2019S REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM SERVICES PROVIDED TO NON-BASSETT CUSTOMERS.  ON DECEMBER 21, 2017, WE PURCHASED CERTAIN ASSETS AND ASSUMED CERTAIN LIABILITIES OF LANE VENTURE FROM HERITAGE HOME GROUP, LLC FOR $15,556 IN CASH. LANE VENTURE IS A MANUFACTURER AND DISTRIBUTOR OF PREMIUM OUTDOOR FURNITURE, AND IS NOW BEING OPERATED AS A COMPONENT OF OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT. THIS ACQUISITION MARKED OUR ENTRY INTO THE MARKET FOR OUTDOOR FURNITURE AND WE BELIEVE THAT LANE VENTURE HAS PROVIDED A FOUNDATION FOR US TO BECOME A SIGNIFICANT PARTICIPANT IN THIS CATEGORY. WE PLAN TO DISTRIBUTE THIS BRAND OUTSIDE OF OUR BASSETT STORE NETWORK WITH PLANS TO INTRODUCE A BASSETT-BRANDED LINE IN THE STORES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. SEE NOTE 3 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING THIS ACQUISITION.  24 OF 40  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  JUNE 1, 2019  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  AT JUNE 1, 2019, OUR BHF STORE NETWORK INCLUDED 70 COMPANY-OWNED STORES AND 33 LICENSEE-OWNED STORES. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE OPENED ONE NEW STORE IN SARASOTA, FLORIDA.  WE CONTINUE TO EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY OF GROWING THE COMPANY THROUGH OPENING NEW STORES, REPOSITIONING STORES TO IMPROVED LOCATIONS WITHIN A MARKET AND CLOSING UNDERPERFORMING STORES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS PLANNED STORE OPENINGS WHERE LEASES HAVE BEEN EXECUTED.  SIZE  PLANNED  LOCATION  TYPE  SQ. FT.  OPENING  NEW STORES.  PRINCETON, NJ  CORPORATE  13,000  Q4 2019  THORNTON, CO  LICENSEE  23,000  Q1 2020  REPOSITIONINGS.  PALM BEACH, FL  CORPORATE  15,000  Q1 2020  FOLLOWING THE PLANNED OPENINGS SHOWN ABOVE, WE EXPECT TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE PACE OF THE BHF NETWORK EXPANSION AND FOCUS ON MAXIMIZING PROFITABLE SALES VOLUME THROUGH OUR EXISTING STORES.  AS WITH ANY RETAIL OPERATION, PRIOR TO OPENING A NEW STORE WE INCUR SUCH EXPENSES AS RENT, TRAINING COSTS AND OTHER PAYROLL RELATED COSTS. THESE COSTS GENERALLY RANGE BETWEEN $200 TO $400 PER STORE DEPENDING ON THE OVERALL RENT COSTS FOR THE LOCATION AND THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE TIME WHEN WE TAKE PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE STORE SPACE AND THE TIME OF THE STORE OPENING. GENERALLY, RENT PAYMENTS DURING A BUILDOUT PERIOD BETWEEN DELIVERY OF POSSESSION AND OPENING OF A NEW STORE ARE DEFERRED AND THEREFORE STRAIGHT LINE RENT EXPENSE RECOGNIZED DURING THAT TIME DOES NOT REQUIRE CASH. INHERENT IN OUR RETAIL BUSINESS MODEL, WE ALSO INCUR LOSSES IN THE TWO TO THREE MONTHS OF OPERATION FOLLOWING A NEW STORE OPENING. LIKE OTHER FURNITURE RETAILERS, WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE A SALE UNTIL THE FURNITURE IS DELIVERED TO OUR CUSTOMER. BECAUSE OUR RETAIL BUSINESS MODEL GENERALLY DOES NOT INVOLVE MAINTAINING A STOCK OF RETAIL INVENTORY THAT WOULD RESULT IN QUICK DELIVERY AND BECAUSE OF THE CUSTOM NATURE OF MANY OF OUR FURNITURE OFFERINGS, DELIVERY TO OUR CUSTOMERS USUALLY OCCURS ABOUT 30 DAYS AFTER AN ORDER IS PLACED. WE GENERALLY REQUIRE A DEPOSIT AT THE TIME OF ORDER AND COLLECT THE REMAINING BALANCE WHEN THE FURNITURE IS DELIVERED, AT WHICH TIME THE SALE IS RECOGNIZED. COUPLED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS, TOTAL START-UP LOSSES CAN RANGE FROM $400 TO $600 PER STORE. WHILE OUR RETAIL EXPANSION IS INITIALLY COSTLY, WE BELIEVE OUR SITE SELECTION AND NEW STORE PRESENTATION WILL GENERALLY RESULT IN LOCATIONS THAT OPERATE AT OR ABOVE A RETAIL BREAK-EVEN LEVEL WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME FOLLOWING STORE OPENING. FACTORS AFFECTING THE LENGTH OF TIME REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS MAY INCLUDE THE LEVEL OF BRAND RECOGNITION, THE DEGREE OF LOCAL COMPETITION, THE DEPTH OF PENETRATION IN A PARTICULAR MARKET AND THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE LOCAL AND U.S. ECONOMY. EVEN AS NEW STORES RAMP UP TO BREAK-EVEN, WE DO REALIZE ADDITIONAL WHOLESALE SALES VOLUME THAT LEVERAGES THE FIXED COSTS IN OUR WHOLESALE BUSINESS.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR DIGITAL EFFORT TO IMPROVE OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 JOURNEY FROM THE TIME THEY BEGIN ON OUR WEBSITE TO THE FINAL STEP OF DELIVERING THE GOODS TO THEIR HOMES. TODAY\u2019S CUSTOMERS EXPECT THEIR DIGITAL EXPERIENCES AND COMMUNICATIONS TO BE PERSONALIZED, HIGHLY-RELEVANT AND CATERED TO MATCH THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND PREFERENCES. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING A CENTRALIZED CUSTOMER CARE CENTER THAT WILL TRACK EACH CUSTOMER\u2019S PATH FROM INITIAL ENGAGEMENT THROUGH POINT OF SALE AND ULTIMATELY TO THEIR POST-DELIVERY EXPERIENCE WITH THE FURNITURE USING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT (CRM) SOFTWARE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE DATA CAPTURED DURING THE CUSTOMER\u2019S JOURNEY WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE INSIGHTS AND RESULT IN DRIVING OPERATIONAL BEST PRACTICES IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD.  25 OF 40  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  JUNE 1, 2019  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013  PERIODS  ENDED  JUNE 1  , 2019  COMPARED WITH  THE  PERIODS  ENDED  MAY 26  , 2018  .

QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF RESULTS - WHOLESALE  THE 1.0% DECREASE IN THE NET SALES FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A 6.6% DECREASE IN FURNITURE SHIPMENTS TO THE OPEN MARKET (OUTSIDE THE BASSETT HOME FURNISHINGS NETWORK), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $298 INCREASE IN LANE VENTURE SHIPMENTS. SHIPMENTS TO THE BASSETT HOME FURNISHINGS NETWORK WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. GROSS MARGIN FOR THE WHOLESALE SEGMENT WAS 34.3% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 32.9% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER MARGINS IN THE DOMESTIC CUSTOM UPHOLSTERY OPERATIONS AS PRICE INCREASES IMPLEMENTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 OFFSET THE INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS EXPERIENCED LATE IN 2017 AND EARLY 2018. WHOLESALE SG&A FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 INCREASED TO 29.3% AS COMPARED TO 28.1% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.

THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A $2,304 INCREASE IN LANE VENTURE SHIPMENTS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WHEN WE WERE THEN IN THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING THE NEWLY ACQUIRED OPERATIONS INTO THE COMPANY, ALONG WITH A 2.0% INCREASE IN SHIPMENTS TO THE BHF NETWORK PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 0.6% DECREASE IN FURNITURE SHIPMENTS TO THE OPEN MARKET (OUTSIDE THE BHF NETWORK). GROSS MARGIN FOR THE WHOLESALE SEGMENT WAS 33.5% FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 32.6% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER MARGINS IN DOMESTIC CUSTOM UPHOLSTERY OPERATIONS AS PRICE INCREASES IMPLEMENTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 OFFSET THE INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS EXPERIENCED LATE IN 2017 AND EARLY 2018. THIS MARGIN IMPROVEMENT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARGINS IN THE IMPORTED CASEGOODS OPERATION DUE TO A $390 INVENTORY VALUATION CHARGE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR EXIT FROM THE JUVENILE LINE OF BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, BOTH THE UPHOLSTERY AND WOOD OPERATIONS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY HIGHER LABOR COSTS DUE TO HIGHER EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE EXPENSES FROM UNFAVORABLE CLAIM EXPERIENCE, PRIMARILY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.

ALTHOUGH MOST OF OUR GOODS ARE DOMESTICALLY MADE, AND MOST OF OUR OTHER GOODS ARE IMPORTED FROM COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF CHINA, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT FROM THE TARIFFS HAS BEEN IN THE COST OF THE FABRIC THAT WE USE IN OUR UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES. WE IMPLEMENTED A PRICE INCREASE LATE IN THE QUARTER TO MITIGATE THESE COST INCREASES.  THE INCREASE IN SG&A EXPENSES FOR COMPARABLE STORES AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES TO 53.8% WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DE-LEVERAGING OF FIXED COSTS FROM LOWER SALES VOLUMES, INEFFICIENCIES IN THE WAREHOUSE AND HOME DELIVERY OPERATION AND HIGHER FINANCING COSTS AS MORE OF OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS CHOSE TO FINANCE THEIR PURCHASES THROUGH OUR THIRD-PARTY CREDIT PROVIDER. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY VARIOUS FIXED COST DECREASES THAT RESULTED FROM CHANGES TO OUR COST STRUCTURE.  THE $485 INCREASE IN THE OPERATING LOSS FROM NON-COMPARABLE STORES FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 INCLUDES NEW STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS OF $369 COMPARED TO $201 FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. WE INCUR LOSSES IN THE FIRST TWO TO THREE MONTHS OF OPERATION FOLLOWING A STORE OPENING AS SALES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT UNTIL THE FURNITURE IS DELIVERED TO ITS CUSTOMERS RESULTING IN OPERATING EXPENSES WITHOUT THE NORMAL SALES VOLUME. BECAUSE WE DO NOT MAINTAIN A STOCK OF RETAIL INVENTORY THAT WOULD RESULT IN QUICK DELIVERY, AND BECAUSE OF THE CUSTOM NATURE OF THE FURNITURE OFFERINGS, SUCH DELIVERIES ARE GENERALLY NOT MADE UNTIL AFTER 30 DAYS FROM WHEN THE FURNITURE IS ORDERED BY THE CUSTOMER. COUPLED WITH THE PRE-OPENING COSTS, TOTAL START-UP LOSSES TYPICALLY AMOUNT TO $400 TO $600 PER STORE. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WE INCURRED $299 OF POST-OPENING LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE THREE NEW STORES OPENED DURING THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS OF 2019 COMPARED TO $411 OF POST-OPENING LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER LOCATIONS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  EACH ADDITION TO OUR COMPANY-OWNED STORE NETWORK RESULTS IN INCREMENTAL FIXED OVERHEAD COSTS, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH LOCAL STORE PERSONNEL, OCCUPANCY COSTS AND WAREHOUSING EXPENSES. THE INCREMENTAL SG&A EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH NEW STORE WILL BE ONGOING.  YEAR-TO-DATE  ANALYSIS OF RESULTS - RETAIL  THE DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE 70 COMPANY-OWNED BHF STORES WAS DRIVEN BY A 7.5% DECREASE FOR THE 57 COMPARABLE STORES FROM THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $8,459 INCREASE IN NON-COMPARABLE STORE SALES AS WE HAVE OPENED 13 STORES OVER THE LAST 21 MONTHS. ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS (NORMALIZING FOR THE EXTRA WEEK IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2019), COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECREASED 10.9%.  WHILE WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE SALES UNTIL GOODS ARE DELIVERED TO THE CONSUMER, MANAGEMENT TRACKS WRITTEN SALES (THE RETAIL DOLLAR VALUE OF SALES ORDERS TAKEN, RATHER THAN DELIVERED) AS A KEY STORE PERFORMANCE INDICATOR. WRITTEN SALES FOR COMPARABLE STORES DECREASED BY 6.1% FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST HALF OF 2018. ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS, COMPARABLE STORE WRITTEN SALES DECREASED 9.6%.  THE DECREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE GROSS MARGINS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED WHOLESALE COSTS AS A RESULT OF TARIFFS ON CHINESE PRODUCTS INSTITUTED IN LATE 2018 ALONG WITH HIGHER COSTS OF FREIGHT, BOTH OF WHICH WERE PASSED ON IN A WHOLESALE PRICE INCREASE IN JANUARY 2019. ALTHOUGH MOST OF OUR GOODS ARE DOMESTICALLY MADE, AND MOST OF OUR OTHER GOODS ARE IMPORTED FROM COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF CHINA, THE TARIFFS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COST OF A PORTION OF THE FABRIC THAT WE USE IN OUR UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES. WE IMPLEMENTED A PRICE INCREASE LATE IN THE QUARTER TO MITIGATE THESE COST INCREASES. GROSS MARGINS WERE ALSO IMPACTED BY INCREASED CLEARANCE ACTIVITY PRIMARILY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE TO THE LAUNCH OF THE NEW CUSTOM UPHOLSTERY PROGRAM AND THE SELLOFF OF EXISTING FLOOR SAMPLES AND OTHER CLEARANCE PRODUCT AS A RESULT OF THE REPOSITIONING OF TWO STORES IN THE HOUSTON MARKET LATE IN 2018.  THE INCREASE IN SG&A EXPENSES FOR COMPARABLE STORES AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES TO 52.5% WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DE-LEVERAGING OF FIXED COSTS FROM LOWER SALES VOLUMES, INEFFICIENCIES IN THE WAREHOUSE AND HOME DELIVERY OPERATION, HIGHER EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE EXPENSES FROM UNFAVORABLE CLAIM EXPERIENCE PRIMARILY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND HIGHER FINANCING COSTS AS MORE OF OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS CHOSE TO FINANCE THEIR PURCHASES THROUGH OUR THIRD-PARTY CREDIT PROVIDER. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY VARIOUS FIXED COST DECREASES THAT RESULTED FROM CHANGES TO OUR COST STRUCTURE.  32 OF 40  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  JUNE 1, 2019  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  THE $630 INCREASE IN THE OPERATING LOSS FROM NON-COMPARABLE STORES FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 INCLUDES NEW STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS OF $863 COMPARED TO $903 FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. WE INCUR LOSSES IN THE FIRST TWO TO THREE MONTHS OF OPERATION FOLLOWING A STORE OPENING AS SALES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT UNTIL THE FURNITURE IS DELIVERED TO ITS CUSTOMERS RESULTING IN OPERATING EXPENSES WITHOUT THE NORMAL SALES VOLUME. BECAUSE WE DO NOT MAINTAIN A STOCK OF RETAIL INVENTORY THAT WOULD RESULT IN QUICK DELIVERY, AND BECAUSE OF THE CUSTOM NATURE OF THE FURNITURE OFFERINGS, SUCH DELIVERIES ARE GENERALLY NOT MADE UNTIL AFTER 30 DAYS FROM WHEN THE FURNITURE IS ORDERED BY THE CUSTOMER. COUPLED WITH THE PRE-OPENING COSTS, TOTAL START-UP LOSSES TYPICALLY AMOUNT TO $400 TO $600 PER STORE. DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 WE INCURRED $1,128 OF POST-OPENING LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIVE NEW STORES OPENED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 COMPARED TO $1,151 OF POST-OPENING LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER LOCATIONS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2018.  EACH ADDITION TO OUR COMPANY-OWNED STORE NETWORK RESULTS IN INCREMENTAL FIXED OVERHEAD COSTS, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH LOCAL STORE PERSONNEL, OCCUPANCY COSTS AND WAREHOUSING EXPENSES. THE INCREMENTAL SG&A EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH NEW STORE WILL BE ONGOING.  RETAIL BACKLOG  THE DOLLAR VALUE OF OUR RETAIL BACKLOG, REPRESENTING ORDERS RECEIVED BUT NOT YET DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS, WAS $30,910, OR AN AVERAGE OF $442 PER OPEN STORE, AT JUNE 1, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH A RETAIL BACKLOG OF $28,697, OR AN AVERAGE OF $448 PER OPEN STORE, AT MAY 26, 2018.

QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 LOGISTICAL SERVICES  THE DECREASE IN REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED DISCONTINUATION OF HOME DELIVERY SERVICES TO THIRD-PARTY CUSTOMERS. THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN ZENITH\u2019S OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED EFFICIENCIES IN THE MIDDLE MILE OPERATION DUE TO LOWER FREIGHT VOLUMES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED EXPENSES IN THE HOME DELIVERY OPERATION.  YEAR-TO-DATE  ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 LOGISTICAL SERVICES  ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS (NORMALIZING FOR THE EXTRA WEEK IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019), REVENUES FOR ZENITH DECREASED $2,357 OR 5.5%. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED DISCONTINUATION OF HOME DELIVERY SERVICES TO THIRD-PARTY CUSTOMERS. THE DECREASE IN ZENITH\u2019S OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED EXPENSES IN THE HOME DELIVERY OPERATION.  OTHER  ITEMS  A  FFECTING  N  ET  INCOME  EARLY RETIREMENT PROGRAM  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE OFFERED AN EARLY RETIREMENT PACKAGE TO CERTAIN ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY. TWENTY-THREE EMPLOYEES ACCEPTED THE OFFER, WHICH EXPIRED ON FEBRUARY 28, 2019. THESE EMPLOYEES ARE TO RECEIVE PAY EQUAL TO ONE-HALF THEIR CURRENT SALARY PLUS BENEFITS OVER A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR FROM THE FINAL DAY OF EACH INDIVIDUAL\u2019S ACTIVE EMPLOYMENT. ACCORDINGLY, WE RECOGNIZED A CHARGE OF $733 DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019. THE UNPAID OBLIGATION OF $835 AT JUNE 1, 2019 WILL SUBSTANTIALLY BE PAID OUT WITHIN ONE YEAR.  33 OF 40  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  JUNE 1, 2019  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  OTHER  L  OSS,  N  ET  OTHER LOSS, NET, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019 WAS $145 AS COMPARED TO $233 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 26, 2018. THE DECREASED NET LOSS IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER NET COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPANY-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE AND INCREASED INTEREST INCOME DUE TO RISING YIELDS ON OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  OTHER LOSS, NET, FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019 WAS $268 AS COMPARED TO $860 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 26, 2018. THE DECREASED NET LOSS IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LARGER TOTAL DEATH BENEFITS RECEIVED IN FISCAL 2019 FROM LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES COVERING FORMER EXECUTIVES, INCREASED INTEREST INCOME DUE TO RISING YIELDS ON OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AND LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO OVERALL LOWER LEVELS OF DEBT.  INCOME  T  AXES  AND IMPACT OF TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT  WE CALCULATE AN ANTICIPATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR BASED ON OUR ANNUAL ESTIMATES OF PRETAX INCOME AND USE THAT EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO RECORD OUR YEAR-TO-DATE INCOME TAX PROVISION.  ANY CHANGE IN ANNUAL PROJECTIONS OF PRETAX INCOME COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE RESPECTIVE QUARTER.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cACT\u201d) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE ACT REDUCED THE FEDERAL STATUTORY CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 FOR ALL CORPORATE TAXPAYERS.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 1, 2019 DIFFERS FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF STATE INCOME TAXES AND VARIOUS PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, INCLUDING THE RECOGNITION OF NON-TAXABLE PROCEEDS FROM COMPANY-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE.  BECAUSE THE ACT SPECIFIED THE NEW 21% TAX RATE BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2018, WE WERE ONLY SUBJECT TO THE REDUCED RATE FOR 11 MONTHS OF 2018.  THEREFORE, WE COMPUTED OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2018 USING A BLENDED FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 22.2%.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 26, 2018 OF 21.3% AND 51.4%, RESPECTIVELY, DIFFER FROM THE BLENDED STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO A DISCRETE CHARGE (BENEFIT) OF ($155) AND $2,032, RESPECTIVELY, ARISING FROM THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THE LOWER STATUTORY RATE.  OTHER ITEMS IMPACTING OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MAY 26, 2018 INCLUDED THE EFFECTS OF STATE INCOME TAXES AND VARIOUS PERMANENT DIFFERENCES INCLUDING THE FAVORABLE IMPACTS OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ON STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION OF $16 AND $197, RESPECTIVELY, NON-TAXABLE LIFE INSURANCE PROCEEDS OF $266 DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, AND THE SECTION 199: DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES DEDUCTION, WHICH WAS ELIMINATED BY THE ACT FOR OUR FISCAL 2019 TAX RETURN.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH FLOWS  ALTHOUGH WE GENERATED $6,792 IN OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, CASH USED IN OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 WAS $8,942 COMPARED TO $279 PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2018, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE IN CASH USED OF $9,221. THIS INCREASE USE OF CASH IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INVESTMENT IN INVENTORY DUE TO OPENING NEW STORES, OTHER CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL DUE IN PART TO THE TIMING IMPACT OF THE ADDITIONAL WEEK IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND LOWER COMPARABLE STORE SALES ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS RESULTING IN REDUCED CASH FLOWS.  OUR OVERALL CASH POSITION DECREASED BY $21,887 DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2019. IN ADDITION TO THE CASH USED IN OPERATIONS, WE USED $7,959 OF CASH IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL STORE EXPANSION AND RELOCATIONS. NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $4,986, INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OF $2,603 AND STOCK REPURCHASES OF $2,347 UNDER OUR EXISTING SHARE REPURCHASE PLAN, OF WHICH $15,637 REMAINS AUTHORIZED AT JUNE 1, 2019. WITH CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALING $34,224 ON HAND AT JUNE 1, 2019, EXPECTED FUTURE OPERATING CASH FLOWS, EXPECTED REDUCED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FROM FEWER STORE OPENINGS AND THE AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT LINE NOTED BELOW, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO FUND OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  DEBT AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS  OUR CREDIT FACILITY WITH OUR BANK PROVIDES FOR A LINE OF CREDIT OF UP TO $25,000. THIS CREDIT FACILITY IS UNSECURED AND CONTAINS COVENANTS REQUIRING US TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN KEY FINANCIAL RATIOS. WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE AGREEMENT AND EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL MATURE IN DECEMBER 2021. AT JUNE 1, 2019, WE HAD $2,798 OUTSTANDING UNDER STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AGAINST OUR LINE, LEAVING AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT LINE OF $22,202. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE OUTSTANDING STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT WITH ANOTHER BANK TOTALING $325.  34 OF 40  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  JUNE 1, 2019  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  AT JUNE 1, 2019 WE HAD OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL TOTALING $72 UNDER REAL ESTATE NOTES PAYABLE.

THE ACQUISITION WILL CREATE ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES WITHIN THE COMPANY\u2019S HIGH COLOR COMMERCIAL PRINT PRODUCT LINE, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS MODEL.  MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THIS ACQUISITION TO BE IMMATERIAL.  ON JULY 31, 2018, THE COMPANY ISSUED AN AGGREGATE OF 829,126 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY, PAR VALUE $2.50 PER SHARE, TO THE FORMER STOCKHOLDERS OF WRIGHT BUSINESS FORMS, INC., D/B/A WRIGHT BUSINESS GRAPHICS (\u201c  WRIGHT  \u201d), AS PARTIAL CONSIDERATION FOR THE ACQUISITION BY THE COMPANY OF ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY INTERESTS OF WRIGHT PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, DATED JULY 16, 2018 (THE \u201c  MERGER AGREEMENT  \u201d).

BUSINESS OVERVIEW  OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES WE ARE THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF BUSINESS FORMS, PRESSURE-SEAL FORMS, LABELS, TAGS, ENVELOPES, AND PRESENTATION FOLDERS TO INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS IN THE UNITED STATES.  WE ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF MANUFACTURING, DESIGNING, AND SELLING BUSINESS FORMS AND OTHER PRINTED BUSINESS PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO DISTRIBUTORS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. WE OPERATE 61 MANUFACTURING PLANTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES IN 21 STRATEGICALLY LOCATED STATES.  APPROXIMATELY 95% OF THE BUSINESS PRODUCTS WE MANUFACTURE ARE CUSTOM AND SEMI-CUSTOM PRODUCTS, CONSTRUCTED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF SIZES, COLORS, NUMBER OF PARTS, AND QUANTITIES ON AN INDIVIDUAL JOB BASIS, DEPENDING UPON THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 SPECIFICATIONS.

WE SELL PREDOMINANTLY THROUGH PRIVATE PRINTERS AND INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, AS WELL AS TO MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS. NORTHSTAR COMPUTER FORMS, INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ALSO SELLS DIRECT TO A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, GENERALLY LARGE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS (WHERE A DISTRIBUTOR IS NOT ACCEPTABLE OR AVAILABLE TO THE END-USER).  ADAMS MCCLURE, LP, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ALSO SELLS DIRECT TO A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, WHERE SALES ARE GENERALLY THROUGH ADVERTISING AGENCIES.  THE PRINTING INDUSTRY GENERALLY SELLS ITS PRODUCTS EITHER DIRECTLY TO END USERS, A MARKET DOMINATED BY A FEW LARGE MANUFACTURERS, SUCH AS R.R. DONNELLEY AND SONS, STAPLES, INC., STANDARD REGISTER CO. (A SUBSIDIARY OF TAYLOR CORPORATION), AND CENVEO, INC., OR, LIKE THE COMPANY, THROUGH A VARIETY OF INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND DISTRIBUTOR GROUPS. WHILE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE, BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ADEQUATE PUBLIC STATISTICAL INFORMATION, TO DETERMINE THE COMPANY\u2019S SHARE OF THE TOTAL BUSINESS PRODUCTS MARKET, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY IS THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF BUSINESS FORMS, PRESSURE-SEAL FORMS, LABELS, TAGS, ENVELOPES, AND PRESENTATION FOLDERS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRIBUTING PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPETITORS THAT OPERATE IN THIS SEGMENT, RANGING IN SIZE FROM SINGLE EMPLOYEE-OWNED OPERATIONS TO MULTI-PLANT ORGANIZATIONS. WE BELIEVE OUR STRATEGIC LOCATIONS AND BUYING POWER PERMIT US TO COMPETE ON A FAVORABLE BASIS WITHIN THE DISTRIBUTOR MARKET ON COMPETITIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS SERVICE, QUALITY, AND PRICE.  DISTRIBUTION OF BUSINESS FORMS AND OTHER BUSINESS PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES IS PRIMARILY DONE THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS, INCLUDING BUSINESS FORMS DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS, DIRECT MAIL, COMMERCIAL PRINTERS, PAYROLL AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE SOFTWARE COMPANIES, AND ADVERTISING AGENCIES.  RAW MATERIALS PRINCIPALLY CONSIST OF A WIDE VARIETY OF WEIGHTS, WIDTHS, COLORS, SIZES, AND QUALITIES OF PAPER FOR BUSINESS PRODUCTS PURCHASED PRIMARILY FROM ONE MAJOR SUPPLIER AT FAVORABLE PRICES BASED ON THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS.  BUSINESS PRODUCTS USAGE IN THE PRINTING INDUSTRY IS GENERALLY NOT SEASONAL. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CONTRACTION OF THE TRADITIONAL BUSINESS FORMS INDUSTRY ARE THE PREDOMINANT FACTORS IN QUARTERLY VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS.  BUSINESS CHALLENGES  WE ARE ENGAGED IN AN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCING CONSOLIDATION OF SOME OF OUR TRADITIONAL CHANNELS, PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE, PAPER SUPPLIER CAPACITY ADJUSTMENTS, AND INCREASED PRICING AND POTENTIAL SUPPLY ALLOCATIONS DUE TO DEMAND/SUPPLY CURVE IMBALANCE.  TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES HAVE MADE ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION OF DOCUMENTS, INTERNET HOSTING, DIGITAL PRINTING AND PRINT-ON-DEMAND VALID, COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL CUSTOM-PRINTED DOCUMENTS AND CUSTOMER COMMUNICATIONS.  IMPROVED EQUIPMENT HAS BECOME MORE ACCESSIBLE TO OUR COMPETITORS DUE TO THE CONTINUED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT.  WE FACE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE SUPPLY CHAIN IN AN ALREADY OVER-SUPPLIED, PRICE-COMPETITIVE PRINT INDUSTRY.  THE CHALLENGES OF OUR BUSINESS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  TRANSFORMATION OF OUR PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS  \u2013  WHILE TRADITIONAL BUSINESS DOCUMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO CONDUCT BUSINESS, MANY ARE BEING REPLACED THROUGH THE USE OF CHEAPER PAPER GRADES OR IMPORTED PAPER, OR DEVALUED WITH ADVANCES IN DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, CAUSING STEADY DECLINES IN DEMAND FOR A PORTION OF OUR CURRENT PRODUCT LINE.  TRANSFORMING OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE INNOVATIVE, VALUABLE SOLUTIONS THROUGH LOWER LABOR AND FIXED CHARGES TO OUR CUSTOMERS ON A PROACTIVE BASIS WILL REQUIRE US TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN NEW AND EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND TO DEVELOP KEY STRATEGIC BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, SUCH AS PRINT-ON-DEMAND SERVICES AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS THAT ASSIST CUSTOMERS IN THEIR TRANSITION TO DIGITAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS.  IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND NICHES THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS THE ADDITION OF OUR ENVELOPE OFFERINGS, TAG OFFERINGS, FOLDER OFFERINGS, HEALTHCARE WRISTBANDS, SPECIALTY PACKAGING, DIRECT MAIL, PRESSURE SEAL PRODUCTS, SECURE DOCUMENT SOLUTIONS, INNOVATIVE IN-MOLD LABEL OFFERINGS AND LONG-RUN INTEGRATED PRODUCTS WITH HIGH COLOR WEB PRINTING, WHICH PROVIDE US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH AND DIFFERENTIATE US FROM OUR COMPETITION.  PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND PRICE COMPETITION WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY  \u2013 THE STRONG U.S. DOLLAR DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2018 ATTRACTED CHEAPER MATERIAL INTO THE UNITED STATES, NOTWITHSTANDING THE IMPOSITION OF TRADE TARIFFS, WHICH IMPAIRED THE PRICE ADVANTAGE LARGER SUPPLIERS HAD OVER SMALLER COMPETITORS AND HELPED TO MAINTAIN PRICING.  HOWEVER, WITH THE SUBSEQUENT WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR DURING THE LATTER PORTION OF FISCAL 2018 AND FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019, THE PRICE ADVANTAGE OF FOREIGN IMPORTS LARGELY DISSIPATED DURING MOST OF FISCAL 2019, WHICH HAS LED TO LOWER VOLUMES OF IMPORTED PAPER AND AN INCREASE IN DOMESTIC EXPORTS.  MEANWHILE,  21  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2019  SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY LEFT THE MARKET DURING THIS PERIOD, WHETHER PLANNED OR UNPLANNED (AS IN THE CASE OF THE BANKRUPTCY OF SEVERAL MILLS).  IN ADDITION, SOME MILLS MOVED CAPACIT  Y FORMERLY USED FOR COATED PRODUCTION TO UNCOATED PRODUCTION DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO OBTAIN HIGHER MARGINS ON THESE PRODUCTS.  EVEN WITH SHRINKING DEMAND, THIS LED TO A SUPPLY/DEMAND IMBALANCE WITH MOST MILLS RUNNING IN EXCESS OF 90% OF CAPACITY ACROSS ALL  GRADES DURING FISCAL 2019.  AT THIS LEVEL, SUPPLIERS HAVE HISTORICALLY RAISED PRICES IN THE MARKETPLACE, AND FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS NO EXCEPTION, WITH SUPPLIERS RAISING PRICES MULTIPLE TIMES ACROSS ALL FACETS OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, FROM RAW MATERIALS  TO SUPPLIES.  IN THE PAST, PRICE INCREASES HAVE BEEN LESS FREQUENT, WHICH ALLOWED MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE PRICING ADJUSTMENTS IN A TIMELY MANNER.  THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF INCREASES DURING 2019 IMPACTED THE ABILITY OF MANUFACTURERS TO TIMELY PASS ALONG THE RE  QUIRED PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE END USERS. ADDITIONALLY, SOME PAPER GRADES DURING 2019 WERE PLACED ON ALLOCATIONS GIVEN THE TIGHT SUPPLY ENVIRONMENT.  GIVEN OUR LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR MAJOR PAPER SUPPLIER, OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND OUR SIZE, WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN THIS PAST FISCAL YEAR.  SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES HAVE EVOLVED RECENTLY.  WITH THE STRENGTHENING U.S. DOLLAR  AND CURRENT PRICING LEVELS, IMPORTS HAVE AGAIN BEGUN TO FLOW INTO THE DOMESTIC MARKETPLACE.  THIS DEVELOPMENT, ALONG WITH CONTINUED SLOWING DOMESTIC DEMAND, HAS RESULTED IN RENEWED MARKETING OF CERTAIN PAPER GRADES THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN PLACED ON ALLOCATION.  HISTORICALLY, THIS WOULD RESULT IN THE NORMALIZATION OF PRICING AND COSTS IN THE MARKETPLACE.  HOWEVER, WITH THE CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP OF SEVERAL OF THE LARGER DOMESTIC PAPER MILLS, THIS HISTORICAL SWING IN PRICING MAY NOT OCCUR AND MANUFACTURER\u2019S MARGINS MAY CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.  REGARDLESS OF THESE FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE CYCLICAL, WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON EFFECTIVELY MANAGING AND CONTROLLING OUR PRODUCT COSTS, THROUGH THE USE OF FORECASTING, PRODUCTION AND COSTING MODELS, AS WELL AS WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR DOMESTIC SUPPLIERS TO REDUCE OUR PROCUREMENT COSTS, IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE EFFECTS ON OUR OPERATIONAL RESULTS.  IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE AND LEVERAGE OUR FIXED COSTS.  CONTINUED CONSOLIDATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS  \u2013 OUR CUSTOMERS ARE DISTRIBUTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE CONSOLIDATING OR ARE BEING ACQUIRED BY COMPETITORS.  SOME CUSTOMERS MAY DEMAND BETTER PRICING AND SERVICES, AND OTHER CUSTOMERS MAY BE FORCED TO RELOCATE THEIR BUSINESS TO THEIR NEW PARENT COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A MAJORITY OF THE HISTORICAL BUSINESS OF THESE CUSTOMERS, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE CONSOLIDATIONS AND ACQUISITIONS, WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE, ULTIMATELY WILL IMPACT OUR MARGINS AND SALES.

ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES RELATED TO THE AFOREMENTIONED ITEMS ARE THE MOST CRITICAL DUE TO THEIR EFFECT ON OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS USED IN PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES SECTION OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS PROVIDES INFORMATION WHICH WE BELIEVE IS RELEVANT TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE COMPANY FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AND THE COMPARATIVE PERIOD FOR 2018 ARE SET FORTH IN THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE TABLES BELOW.  CONSOLIDATED SUMMARY  UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF  THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31,  OPERATIONS - DATA (  IN THOUSANDS  )  2019  2018  NET SALES  $108,033  100.0%  $93,419  100.0%  COST OF GOODS SOLD  75,337  69.7  63,228  67.7  GROSS PROFIT MARGIN  32,696  30.3  30,191  32.3  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  19,703  18.3  17,735  19.0  GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS  \u2014  \u2014  (4  )  \u2014  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS  12,993  12.0  12,460  13.3  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  23  \u2014  (131  )  (0.1  )  EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES  13,016  12.0  12,329  13.2  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  3,384  3.1  3,082  3.3  NET EARNINGS  $9,632  8.9%  $9,247  9.9%  THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  NET SALES.  OUR NET SALES WERE $108.0 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MAY 31, 2019, COMPARED TO $93.4 MILLION FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR, OR AN INCREASE OF $14.6 MILLION, OR 15.6%.  ON A SEQUENTIAL QUARTER BASIS, OUR REVENUES INCREASED FROM $100.7 MILLION TO $108.0 MILLION, A $7.3 MILLION INCREASE, OR 7.2%.  RECENT INCREASES IN FOREIGN IMPORTS DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AND CURRENT DOMESTIC PRICINGS LEVELS CONTINUES TO PROVIDE THE ELEMENTS FOR A CHALLENGING MARKETPLACE.  THE ACQUISITIONS OF ABTL (COMPLETED IN APRIL 2018), WRIGHT (COMPLETED IN JULY 2018), AND INTEGRATED (COMPLETED IN MARCH 2019) ARE INTEGRAL PARTS OF OUR STRATEGY TO OFFSET ON GOING TECHNOLOGICAL DISRUPTION AND OTHER CHANGES.  THESE THREE ACQUISITIONS CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY $19.3 MILLION IN NET SALES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019.  23  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2019  COST  OF GOODS SOLD.  OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED $12.1 MILLION FROM $63.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018 TO $75.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, OR 19.1%. OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN (\u201c  MARGIN  \u201d) WAS $32.7 MILLION FOR THE QUAR  TER, OR 30.3% OF NET SALES, COMPARED TO $30.2 MILLION, OR 32.3% OF NET SALES, FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  FOR THE SEQUENTIAL QUARTER OUR MARGIN INCREASED FROM $29.1 MILLION, OR 28.9% OF NET SALES, TO $32.7 MILLION, OR 30.3% OF NET SALES, AN IN  CREASE OF $3.6 MILLION.  WHILE OUR MARGINS AS INDICATED IMPROVED 140 BASIS POINTS OVER THE SEQUENTIAL QUARTER, THEY CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY THE MAGNITUDE OF RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES AND THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN THE LAST Y  EAR.    DURING THE LAST YEAR, TIGHT SUPPLY CONDITIONS ALLOWED FOR MULTIPLE PRICE INCREASES ON RAW MATERIALS, AS WELL AS OTHER ITEMS IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.  HISTORICAL PRICE INCREASES WERE LESS FREQUENT, WHICH ALLOWED MANUFACTURERS THE ABILITY TO PAS  S THE REQUIRED PRICING ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH TO THE MARKETPLACE IN A TIMELY MANNER.  HOWEVER, THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF INCREASES HAVE IMPACTED MANUFACTURERS\u2019 ABILITIES TO TIMELY PASS THESE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE END-USERS.  THESE PRICE INCREASES WILL CONTINU  E TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON MARGINS UNTIL THEY ARE ABLE TO BE PASSED THROUGH TO THE MARKETPLACE, OR COSTS DECLINE.  RECENTLY, DUE TO CURRENT PRICING LEVELS AND THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, THE ENVIRONMENT HAS ONCE AGAIN BEEN ATTRACTIVE FOR IMPO  RTS AND THEY HAVE MORE THAN FILLED ANY VACUUM IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN.  THIS HISTORICALLY HAS LED TO SOME NORMALIZATION/STABILITY IN THE MARKETPLACE.  HOWEVER, WITH THE RECENT OWNERSHIP CHANGE IN SEVERAL LARGER DOMESTIC MILLS, THIS HISTORICAL PENDULUM SWING IN  PRICING MAY NOT OCCUR.  AS MENTIONED EARLIER, THE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED DURING THE PAST YEAR HAVE HAD A DILUTIVE IMPACT ON OUR MARGINS. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE ONCE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY ANALYZE THE BUSINESS COST STRUCTURE AND IMPLEMENT OUR COS  TS SYSTEMS, ITS MARGINS WILL IMPROVE TO MORE NORMALIZED LEVELS.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, OUR SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201c  SG&A  \u201d) EXPENSES WERE $19.7 MILLION COMPARED TO $17.7 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018, AN INCREASE OF $2.0 MILLION, OR 11.3%.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, THE SG&A EXPENSES WERE 18.3% AND 19.0% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AND MAY 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE INCREASE ON OUR SG&A EXPENSES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS, WHICH ADDED APPROXIMATELY $3.2 MILLION TO OUR EXPENSES.  GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS.  THE $4,000 NET GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS DURING THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE SALE OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS.  AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE FACTORS, OUR INCOME FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WAS $13.0 MILLION, OR 12.0% OF NET SALES, AS COMPARED TO $12.5 MILLION, OR 13.3% OF NET SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018.  THE ACQUISITIONS OF ABTL, WRIGHT AND INTEGRATED CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION, $1.1 MILLION AND $0.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF OPERATING INCOME DURING THE QUARTER.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).  OTHER INCOME WAS $23,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $131,000 EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018.  DURING THE CURRENT QUARTER, DUE TO OUR CASH BALANCE, OUR INTEREST INCOME WAS HIGHER THAN OUR INTEREST EXPENSE.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 26.0% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO 25.0% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018.  THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN OUR OVERALL TAX RATE THIS YEAR AS COMPARED TO LAST IS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OUR OVERALL EXPECTED STATE TAX RATE DUE TO CHANGES IN STATE APPORTIONMENT.  NET EARNINGS.  NET EARNINGS, DUE TO THE FACTORS ABOVE, WERE $9.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $9.2 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AN INCREASE OF 4.3%.  NET EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WAS $0.37, COMPARED TO $0.36 FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  24  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2019  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE RELY ON OUR CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY EXTENDED PURSUANT TO OUR SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME (THE \u201c  CREDIT FACILITY  \u201d), TO MEET CASH REQUIREMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS.  THE PRIMARY CASH REQUIREMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS ARE PAYMENTS TO VENDORS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT REPAYMENTS AND RELATED INTEREST PAYMENTS, CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR NONCONTRIBUTORY DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLAN, WHICH COVERS APPROXIMATELY 17% OF OUR AGGREGATE EMPLOYEES (THE \u201c  PENSION PLAN  \u201d), AND THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  WE EXPECT TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS SUPPLEMENTED BY OUR CREDIT FACILITY AS REQUIRED TO COVER OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  MAY 31,  FEBRUARY 28,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2019  WORKING CAPITAL  $129,149  $134,542  CASH  $87,365  $88,442  WORKING CAPITAL.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL DECREASED $5.4 MILLION OR 4.0%, FROM $134.5 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019 TO $129.1 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2019.  OUR CURRENT RATIO, CALCULATED BY DIVIDING OUR CURRENT ASSETS BY OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES, DECREASED FROM 5.3 TO 1.0 AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019 TO 4.4 TO 1.0 AT MAY 31, 2019.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND CURRENT RATIO WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY AN INCREASE IN OUR INCOME TAXES PAYABLE OF $3.4 MILLION AND THE ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT ASC 842 WHICH INCREASED OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES BY $5.0 MILLION.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $15,671  $11,890  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  $(9,661  )  $(5,937  )  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $(7,087  )  $(5,763  )  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY $3.8 MILLION FROM $11.9 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018 TO $15.7 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019.  OUR INCREASED OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS IN COMPARISON TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF TWO FACTORS: I) A $3.4 MILLION DECREASE IN OUR INVENTORIES, AND II) A $2.5 MILLION INCREASE IN OUR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES.  THIS INCREASE IN OUR CASH WAS OFFSET BY A $2.6 MILLION INCREASE IN OUR PREPAID EXPENSES AND INCOME TAXES.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $3.7 MILLION FROM $5.9 MILLION TO $9.7 MILLION USED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018 AND MAY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR ACQUISITION OF INTEGRATED IN THE CURRENT QUARTER OF $8.9 MILLION AS COMPARED TO $4.7 MILLION USED FOR THE ACQUISITION OF ABTL IN THE SAME QUARTER LAST FISCAL YEAR OFFSET BY $0.4 MILLION LESS IN CASH USED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  WE USED $1.3 MILLION MORE IN CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  WE USED $1.2 MILLION TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019, WHEREAS WE USED $0.7 MILLION TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018.  IN ADDITION, $0.8 MILLION MORE WAS USED TO PAY DIVIDENDS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018.  CREDIT FACILITY.  THE COMPANY\u2019S CREDIT FACILITY, EXTENDED TO THE COMPANY UNTIL AUGUST 11, 2020, PROVIDES THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WITH UP TO $100.0 MILLION IN REVOLVING CREDIT, AS WELL AS A $20.0 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND A $15.0 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR SWING-LINE LOANS.  UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES CAN REQUEST UP TO THREE INCREASES IN THE AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $50.0 MILLION.  THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY IMPOSE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT, MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS AND ASSET DISPOSITIONS, AS WELL AS IMPOSE OTHER CUSTOMARY COVENANTS, SUCH AS REQUIRING THAT OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO NOT BE LESS THAN 1.25:1.00 AND OUR TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO NOT EXCEED 3.00:1.00.  THE COMPANY MAY MAKE DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS SO LONG AS (A) NO EVENT OF DEFAULT HAS OCCURRED AND IS CONTINUING AND (B) THE COMPANY\u2019S NET LEVERAGE RATIO BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO ANY SUCH DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION IS EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN 2.50:1.00.  ALL CALCULATIONS ARE MADE BASED ON GAAP EXISTING AT THE TIME THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS ENTERED INTO.  AS OF MAY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY.  THE CREDIT FACILITY BEARS INTEREST AT THE LIBOR RATE PLUS A SPREAD RANGING FROM 1.0% TO 2.0%, WHICH RATE WAS 3.5% (3 MONTH LIBOR + 1.0%) AT MAY 31, 2019 AND 3.6% (3 MONTH LIBOR + 1.0%) AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  THE RATE IS DETERMINED BY OUR FIXED  25  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2019  CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF TOTAL FUNDED DEBT TO EBITDA.  AS OF MAY 31, 2019, WE HAD $30.0 MILLION OF BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CRED  IT LINE AND $0.7 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, LEAVING APPROXIMATELY $69.3 MILLION AVAILABLE IN BORROWING CAPACITY.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS (OTHER THAN REAL PROPERTY), AS WELL A  S ALL CAPITAL SECURITIES OF EACH OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE AVAILABLE LINE OF CREDIT IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COMPANY\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, SHOULD IT BE REQUIRED.  PENSION PLAN \u2013  WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLAN.  THESE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE REQUIRED UNDER THE MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (\u201c  ERISA  \u201d).  DUE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION FUNDING ACT (HATFA) IN AUGUST 2014, WHICH EFFECTIVELY RAISES THE DISCOUNT RATES MANDATED FOR DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A PLAN\u2019S BENEFIT LIABILITY AND ANNUAL COST OF ACCRUALS, OUR MINIMUM REQUIRED CONTRIBUTION TO THE PENSION PLAN IS ZERO FOR THE PENSION PLAN YEAR ENDING FEBRUARY 29, 2020. GIVEN OUR CURRENT FUNDING STATUS AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND ABSENT ANY SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EVENT, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE IN LINE WITH OUR SERVICE COSTS, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN $1.0 MILLION AND $1.5 MILLION PER YEAR.  WE MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $3.0 MILLION TO OUR PENSION PLAN DURING FISCAL 2019. AS OUR PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES, FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET VALUES COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR FUNDING STATUS, ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES RECORDED AND FUTURE REQUIRED MINIMUM CONTRIBUTIONS.  AT MAY 31, 2019, WE HAD A NET PENSION ASSET RECORDED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET OF $0.6 MILLION.  INVENTORIES  \u2013  WE BELIEVE OUR INVENTORY LEVELS ARE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR CUSTOMER DEMANDS AND WE ANTICIPATE HAVING ADEQUATE SOURCES OF RAW MATERIALS TO MEET FUTURE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS IN EFFECT WITH PAPER SUPPLIERS THAT GOVERN PRICES, BUT DO NOT REQUIRE MINIMUM PURCHASE COMMITMENTS.  CERTAIN OF OUR REBATE PROGRAMS DO, HOWEVER, REQUIRE MINIMUM PURCHASE VOLUMES.  MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES MEETING THE REQUIRED VOLUMES.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  \u2013  WE EXPECT OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, EXCLUSIVE OF CAPITAL REQUIRED FOR POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS, WILL BE WITHIN OUR HISTORICAL LEVELS OF BETWEEN $3.0 MILLION AND $5.0 MILLION.  TO DATE WE HAVE SPENT APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  WE EXPECT TO FUND THESE EXPENDITURES THROUGH EXISTING CASH FLOWS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS & OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  \u2013  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS SINCE FEBRUARY 28, 2019 THAT HAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES  IN PREPARING THE COMPANY\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GAAP, MANAGEMENT MUST MAKE A VARIETY OF DECISIONS WHICH IMPACT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURES.  THESE DECISIONS INCLUDE THE SELECTION OF THE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES TO BE APPLIED AND THE ASSUMPTIONS ON WHICH TO BASE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES.  IN MAKING THESE DECISIONS, MANAGEMENT APPLIES ITS JUDGMENT BASED ON ITS UNDERSTANDING AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELEVANT CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE COMPANY\u2019S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE.  THE COMPANY\u2019S ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE PRESENTATION OF ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND WHICH REQUIRE THE GREATEST USE OF JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES BY MANAGEMENT, ARE DESIGNATED AS ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  SEE DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES UNDER ITEM 7 IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  MANAGEMENT PERIODICALLY RE-EVALUATES AND ADJUSTS ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE.  THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019.  RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  SEE NOTE 1 \u2013 BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND THE DISCLOSURE THEREIN OF RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE (ADOPTED AND NOT YET ADOPTED) TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SET FORTH IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK  OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WERE $121.1 MILLION, A DECREASE OF 29 PERCENT COMPARED TO $169.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018.  IRRIGATION SEGMENT REVENUES DECREASED 23 PERCENT TO $98.6 MILLION AND INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENT REVENUES DECREASED 45 PERCENT TO $22.4 MILLION.  NET EARNINGS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WERE $2.9 MILLION, OR $0.27 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO NET EARNINGS OF $10.4 MILLION, OR $0.96 PER DILUTED SHARE, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018.  NET EARNINGS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WERE REDUCED BY AFTER-TAX COSTS OF $2.6 MILLION, OR $0.23 PER DILUTED SHARE, RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S \u201cFOUNDATION FOR GROWTH\u201d INITIATIVE.  THE PRE-TAX COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH INITIATIVE DURING THE QUARTER WERE $3.9 MILLION, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF PROFESSIONAL CONSULTING FEES AND SEVERANCE COSTS.  THESE COSTS, AND ADDITIONAL FUTURE COSTS ANTICIPATED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INITIATIVE, ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH IMPROVED OPERATING INCOME IN FUTURE PERIODS.  NET EARNINGS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018 WERE REDUCED BY AFTER-TAX COSTS OF $7.5 MILLION, OR $0.70 PER DILUTED SHARE, RELATED TO THE FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH INITIATIVE.  - 20  -  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN ADDITION,  THE BUSINESS DIVESTITURES COMPLETED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 AND THE FIRS  T QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AS PART OF THE FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH INITIATIVE RESULTED IN A  $27.2  MILLION  REDUCTION IN IRRIGATION REVENUES DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER  OF FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL  2018.  NET  EARNINGS  FOR  THE  THIRD  QUARTER  OF  FISCAL 201  8  INCLUDED  $1.5  MILLION, OR $0.  14  PER DILUTED SHARE  , RELATED TO THE BUSINESS DIVESTITURES.  A KEY FINANCIAL OBJECTIVE OF THE FOUNDATION FOR GROWTH IS TO ACHIEVE OPERATING MARGIN PERFORMANCE OF 11 PERCENT TO 12 PERCENT IN FISCAL 2020 ASSUMING NO IMPROVEMENT IN MARKET CONDITIONS FROM FISCAL 2017.  THE COMPANY\u2019S IRRIGATION REVENUES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE NEED FOR IRRIGATED AGRICULTURAL CROP PRODUCTION, WHICH, IN TURN, DEPENDS UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY DRIVERS.  \u2022  AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY PRICES  \u2013 A  S OF MAY 2019, C  ORN PRICES HAVE INCREASED FIVE PERCENT AND SOYBEAN PRICES HAVE DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 17 PERCENT FROM MAY 2018.  CORN PRICES HAVE INCREASED FURTHER IN JUNE AS SEVERE WET WEATHER IN THE U.S. DELAYED PLANTINGS AND FORCED FARMERS TO CURTAIL ACREAGE, RESULTING IN REDUCED SUPPLY ESTIMATES.   SOYBEAN PRICES REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE FROM A RECORD SOYBEAN HARVEST LAST YEAR AND FROM DIMINISHED EXPORTS, DUE IN PART TO AN ONGOING TRADE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA.  \u2022  NET FARM INCOME  \u2013  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (THE \u201cUSDA\u201d) REPORT FROM MARCH 2019 ESTIMATED U.S. 2019 NET FARM INCOME TO BE $69.4 BILLION, UP 10 PERCENT FROM THE USDA\u2019S U.S. 2018 NET FARM INCOME OF $63.1 BILLION.  HOWEVER, FORECASTED 2019 NET FARM INCOME REMAINS SUBSTANTIALLY BELOW THE 10-YEAR U.S. NET FARM INCOME AVERAGE OF $85.3 BILLION (IN NOMINAL DOLLARS), PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF WEAKER PRICES FOR MOST MAJOR CROPS.  \u2022  WEATHER CONDITIONS \u2013  DEMAND FOR IRRIGATION EQUIPMENT IS OFTEN POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY STORM DAMAGE AND PROLONGED PERIODS OF DROUGHT CONDITIONS AS PRODUCERS LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF LOW CROP PRODUCTION AND CROP FAILURES.  CONVERSELY, DEMAND FOR IRRIGATION EQUIPMENT CAN BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED DURING PERIODS OF MORE PREDICTABLE OR EXCESSIVE NATURAL PRECIPITATION.  BEGINNING IN MARCH AND CONTINUING THROUGH MAY, ABOVE-AVERAGE RAINFALL AND WIDESPREAD FLOODING IN MANY PARTS OF THE MIDWEST HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED DEMAND FOR IRRIGATION EQUIPMENT IN THE SHORT-TERM.  \u2022  GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES  \u2013 A NUMBER OF GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS CAN AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  THE AGRICULTURE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2018 (THE \u201cFARM BILL\u201d) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN DECEMBER 2018.  THE 2018 FARM BILL CONTINUES MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE IN THE AGRICULTURAL ACT OF 2014, WHICH EXPIRED IN SEPTEMBER 2018.  SUCH PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A DEGREE OF CERTAINTY TO GROWERS, INCLUDING FUNDING FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY INCENTIVES PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO FARMERS TO IMPLEMENT CONSERVATION PRACTICES, AND IS FREQUENTLY USED TO ASSIST IN THE PURCHASE OF CENTER PIVOT IRRIGATION SYSTEMS.  \u2022  THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\u201cU.S. TAX REFORM\u201d) ENACTED IN DECEMBER 2017 INCREASED THE BENEFIT OF CERTAIN TAX INCENTIVES, SUCH AS THE SECTION 179 INCOME TAX DEDUCTION AND SECTION 168 BONUS DEPRECIATION, WHICH ARE INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE EQUIPMENT PURCHASES BY ALLOWING THE ENTIRE COST OF EQUIPMENT TO BE TREATED AS AN EXPENSE IN THE YEAR OF PURCHASE RATHER THAN AMORTIZED OVER ITS USEFUL LIFE.  \u2022  BIOFUEL PRODUCTION CONTINUES TO BE A MAJOR DEMAND DRIVER FOR IRRIGATED CORN, SUGAR CANE AND SOYBEANS AS THESE CROPS ARE USED IN HIGH VOLUMES TO PRODUCE ETHANOL AND BIODIESEL.  IN NOVEMBER 2018, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (THE \u201cEPA\u201d) ISSUED RENEWABLE FUELS STANDARD (RFS) VOLUME REQUIREMENTS FOR 2019 THAT MODESTLY INCREASED VOLUME REQUIREMENTS COMPARED TO 2018 LEVELS. ON MAY 30, 2019, THE EPA FINALIZED REGULATORY CHANGES TO ALLOW GASOLINE BLENDED WITH UP TO 15 PERCENT ETHANOL (E15) TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 1-PSI REID VAPOR PRESSURE (RVP) WAIVER THAT FORMERLY APPLIED TO 10 PERCENT ETHANOL, OR E10, DURING SUMMER MONTHS.  UNDER THE FINALIZED EXPANSION, E15 WILL BE ALLOWED TO BE SOLD YEAR-ROUND WITHOUT ADDITIONAL RVP CONTROL RATHER THAN BEING AVAILABLE FOR SALE JUST EIGHT MONTHS OF THE YEAR.  \u2022  MANY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS ARE AFFECTED BY GOVERNMENT POLICIES SUCH AS SUBSIDIES AND OTHER AGRICULTURALLY RELATED INCENTIVES.  WHILE THESE POLICIES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON INDIVIDUAL MARKETS, THEY TYPICALLY DO NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF THE COMPANY.  \u2022  CURRENCY  \u2013 THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR FLUCTUATES IN RELATION TO THE VALUE OF CURRENCIES IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES TO WHICH THE COMPANY EXPORTS PRODUCTS AND IN WHICH THE COMPANY MAINTAINS LOCAL OPERATIONS. THE STRENGTHENING OF THE DOLLAR INCREASES THE COST IN THE LOCAL CURRENCY OF THE PRODUCTS EXPORTED FROM THE U.S. INTO THESE COUNTRIES AND, THEREFORE, COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERNATIONAL SALES AND MARGINS. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE  - 21 -  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OF SALES MADE IN ANY AFFECTED FOREIGN CURRENCIES WI  LL  DECLINE  AS THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR  RISES  IN RELATION TO THESE OTHER CURRENCIES.  INTERNATIONAL IRRIGATION MARKETS REMAIN ACTIVE WITH OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION, HOWEVER REGIONAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, CURRENCY CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS CAN CREATE A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT.  ADDITIONALLY, INTERNATIONAL RESULTS ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON PROJECT SALES WHICH TEND TO FLUCTUATE AND CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST ACCURATELY.  THE INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT TO SOME EXTENT ON GOVERNMENT SPENDING FOR ROAD CONSTRUCTION.  IN DECEMBER 2015, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENACTED A FIVE-YEAR, $305 BILLION HIGHWAY-FUNDING BILL TO FUND HIGHWAY AND BRIDGE PROJECTS, THE FIRST LONG-TERM NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SPENDING BILL IN A DECADE.  IN ADDITION, THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION HAS CHANGED HIGHWAY SAFETY PRODUCT CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. THE CHANGE HAS REQUIRED ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING AND COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPETITIVE POSITIONING OF THE COMPANY\u2019S HIGHWAY SAFETY PRODUCTS.  IN SPITE OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING UNCERTAINTY, OPPORTUNITIES EXIST FOR MARKET EXPANSION IN EACH OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCT LINES. DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S TRANSPORTATION SAFETY PRODUCTS CONTINUES TO BE DRIVEN BY POPULATION GROWTH AND THE NEED FOR IMPROVED ROAD SAFETY.  THE BACKLOG OF UNSHIPPED ORDERS AT MAY 31, 2019 WAS $42.5 MILLION COMPARED WITH $55.8 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2018.  APPROXIMATELY $12.4 MILLION OF THE REDUCTION IN BACKLOG RESULTED FROM THE BUSINESS DIVESTITURES COMPLETED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE DIVESTITURES, IRRIGATION SEGMENT BACKLOGS WERE HIGHER AND INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENT BACKLOGS WERE LOWER COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  SUBSEQUENT TO MAY 31, 2019, A $15.0 MILLION ROAD ZIPPER SYSTEM  \u00ae  ORDER WAS RECEIVED FROM A CUSTOMER IN JAPAN, WITH DELIVERY EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  THE COMPANY\u2019S BACKLOG CAN FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO THE SEASONALITY, CYCLICALITY, TIMING AND EXECUTION OF CONTRACTS.  BACKLOG TYPICALLY REPRESENTS LONG-TERM PROJECTS AS WELL AS SHORT LEAD-TIME ORDERS, AND THEREFORE IS GENERALLY NOT A GOOD INDICATION OF THE NEXT FISCAL QUARTER\u2019S REVENUES.  THE GLOBAL DRIVERS FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S MARKETS OF POPULATION GROWTH, EXPANDED FOOD PRODUCTION, EFFICIENT WATER USE AND INFRASTRUCTURE EXPANSION SUPPORT THE COMPANY\u2019S LONG-TERM GROWTH GOALS.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS ARE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WHERE IRRIGATION USE IS LESS DEVELOPED AND DEMAND IS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY FOOD SECURITY, WATER SCARCITY AND POPULATION GROWTH.  - 22  -  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  THE FOLLOWING SECTION PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING RESULTS DISPLAYED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 AND MAY 31, 2018.

OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE ATTRACTIVE RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS BY GENERATING CURRENT INCOME AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL  APPRECIATION FROM OUR INVESTMENTS. WE INVEST PRIMARILY IN SENIOR AND UNITRANCHE LEVERAGED LOANS AND MEZZANINE DEBT ISSUED BY PRIVATE U.S.    MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES, WHICH WE DEFINE AS COMPANIES HAVING EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST,  TAX, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) OF BETWEEN $2 MILLION AND $50 MILLION, BOTH THROUGH DIRECT LENDING AND THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN LOAN SYNDICATES. WE MAY ALSO INVEST UP TO 30.0% OF THE PORTFOLIO IN OPPORTUNISTIC  INVESTMENTS IN ORDER TO SEEK TO ENHANCE RETURNS TO STOCKHOLDERS. SUCH INVESTMENTS MAY INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN DISTRESSED DEBT, WHICH MAY INCLUDE SECURITIES OF COMPANIES IN BANKRUPTCY, FOREIGN DEBT, PRIVATE EQUITY, SECURITIES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT  ARE NOT THINLY TRADED AND STRUCTURED FINANCE VEHICLES SUCH AS COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATION FUNDS.

THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THIS OFFERING WERE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES IN  ACCORDANCE WITH OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGIES. THE FINANCING COSTS AND DISCOUNT OF $1.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE 2025 NOTES HAVE BEEN CAPITALIZED AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE 2025 NOTES.  AT MAY 31, 2019, THE TOTAL 2025 NOTES OUTSTANDING WAS $60.0 MILLION. THE 2025 NOTES ARE LISTED ON THE NYSE UNDER THE TRADING SYMBOL  \u201cSAF\u201d WITH A PAR VALUE OF $25.00 PER SHARE.  79  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  BASIS OF PRESENTATION  THE  PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECTING AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED INVESTMENT VALUATION, REVENUE RECOGNITION AND THE RECOGNITION OF CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE EXPENSE AS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES. WE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED  TO THE MATTERS DESCRIBED BELOW. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO US AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM  THOSE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. A DISCUSSION OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOLLOWS.  INVESTMENT VALUATION  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD  (\u201cFASB\u201d) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 820,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURES  (\u201cASC 820\u201d). ASC 820 DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FAIR  VALUE HIERARCHY BASED ON THE QUALITY OF INPUTS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE AND ENHANCES DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. ASC 820 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO ASSUME THAT ITS INVESTMENTS ARE TO BE SOLD OR ITS LIABILITIES ARE TO BE  TRANSFERRED AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE IN THE PRINCIPAL MARKET TO INDEPENDENT MARKET PARTICIPANTS, OR IN THE ABSENCE OF A PRINCIPAL MARKET, IN THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET, WHICH MAY BE A HYPOTHETICAL MARKET. MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE DEFINED AS BUYERS  AND SELLERS IN THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET THAT ARE INDEPENDENT, KNOWLEDGEABLE, AND WILLING AND ABLE TO TRANSACT.  INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE READILY AVAILABLE ARE FAIR VALUED AT SUCH MARKET QUOTATIONS OBTAINED FROM INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY  PRICING SERVICES AND MARKET MAKERS SUBJECT TO ANY DECISION BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO APPROVE A FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION TO REFLECT SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFFECTING THE VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS. WE VALUE INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE  NOT READILY AVAILABLE AT FAIR VALUE AS APPROVED, IN GOOD FAITH, BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS BASED ON INPUT FROM SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND A THIRD PARTY INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM. DETERMINATIONS OF  FAIR VALUE MAY INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES. THE TYPES OF FACTORS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS INCLUDE THE NATURE AND REALIZABLE VALUE OF ANY COLLATERAL, THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY  TO MAKE PAYMENTS, MARKET YIELD TREND ANALYSIS, THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY DOES BUSINESS, COMPARISON TO PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS.  WE UNDERTAKE A MULTI-STEP VALUATION PROCESS EACH QUARTER WHEN VALUING INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE, AS  DESCRIBED BELOW.  \u2022  EACH INVESTMENT IS INITIALLY VALUED BY THE RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS OF SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS  AND PRELIMINARY VALUATION CONCLUSIONS ARE DOCUMENTED AND DISCUSSED WITH OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT; AND  \u2022  AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM ENGAGED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWS A SELECTION OF THESE  PRELIMINARY VALUATIONS EACH QUARTER SO THAT THE VALUATION OF EACH INVESTMENT FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE IS REVIEWED BY THE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM AT LEAST ONCE EACH FISCAL YEAR. WE USE A PARTY INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM TO  VALUE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE SUBORDINATED NOTES OF SARATOGA CLO AND THE  CLASS F-R-2  NOTES AND  CLASS G-R-2  NOTES TRANCHES OF THE SARATOGA CLOS EVERY QUARTER.  IN ADDITION, ALL OUR INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING VALUATION PROCESS.  \u2022  THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEWS AND APPROVES EACH PRELIMINARY VALUATION AND SARATOGA  INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM (IF APPLICABLE) WILL SUPPLEMENT THE PRELIMINARY VALUATION TO REFLECT ANY COMMENTS PROVIDED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE; AND  80  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSES THE VALUATIONS AND APPROVES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH INVESTMENT, IN GOOD FAITH,  BASED ON THE INPUT OF SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM (TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE) AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS BASED ON A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT UTILIZES PREPAYMENT,  RE-  INVESTMENT AND LOSS ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND PROJECTED PERFORMANCE, ECONOMIC FACTORS, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING CASH FLOW, AND COMPARABLE YIELDS FOR EQUITY INTERESTS IN  COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATION FUNDS SIMILAR TO SARATOGA CLO, WHEN AVAILABLE, AS DETERMINED BY SIA AND RECOMMENDED TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. SPECIFICALLY, WE USE INTEX CASH FLOW MODELS, OR AN APPROPRIATE SUBSTITUTE, TO FORM THE BASIS FOR THE  VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO. THE MODELS USE A SET OF ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING PROJECTED DEFAULT RATES, RECOVERY RATES, REINVESTMENT RATE AND PREPAYMENT RATES IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT ESTIMATED VALUATIONS. THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON  AVAILABLE MARKET DATA AND PROJECTIONS PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES. WE USE THE OUTPUT FROM THE INTEX MODELS (I.E., THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS) TO PERFORM A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO  DETERMINE A VALUATION FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  INCOME RECOGNITION  INTEREST INCOME,  ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUM AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNT, IS RECORDED ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. THE COMPANY STOPS ACCRUING INTEREST ON ITS INVESTMENTS WHEN IT IS DETERMINED THAT INTEREST  IS NO LONGER COLLECTIBLE. DISCOUNTS AND PREMIUMS ON INVESTMENTS PURCHASED ARE ACCRETED/AMORTIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE RESPECTIVE INVESTMENT USING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD. THE AMORTIZED COST OF INVESTMENTS REPRESENTS THE ORIGINAL COST ADJUSTED FOR  THE ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS AND AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS ON INVESTMENTS.  LOANS ARE GENERALLY PLACED ON  NON-ACCRUAL  STATUS WHEN THERE IS REASONABLE DOUBT THAT PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST WILL BE COLLECTED. ACCRUED INTEREST IS GENERALLY RESERVED WHEN A LOAN IS PLACED ON  NON-ACCRUAL  STATUS. INTEREST PAYMENTS RECEIVED ON  NON-ACCRUAL  LOANS MAY BE RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION IN PRINCIPAL DEPENDING UPON MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT REGARDING  COLLECTABILITY.  NON-ACCRUAL  LOANS ARE RESTORED TO ACCRUAL STATUS WHEN PAST DUE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS PAID AND, IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT, ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN CURRENT, ALTHOUGH WE MAY MAKE EXCEPTIONS  TO THIS GENERAL RULE IF THE LOAN HAS SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL VALUE AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION.  PAYMENT-IN-KIND  INTEREST  THE COMPANY HOLDS DEBT AND PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN ITS  PORTFOLIO THAT CONTAIN A  PAYMENT-IN-KIND  (\u201cPIK\u201d) INTEREST PROVISION.  THE PIK INTEREST, WHICH REPRESENTS CONTRACTUALLY DEFERRED INTEREST ADDED TO THE INVESTMENT BALANCE THAT IS GENERALLY DUE AT MATURITY, IS  GENERALLY RECORDED ON THE ACCRUAL BASIS TO THE EXTENT SUCH AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. WE STOP ACCRUING PIK INTEREST IF WE DO NOT EXPECT THE ISSUER TO BE ABLE TO PAY ALL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WHEN DUE.  REVENUES  WE GENERATE REVENUE IN  THE FORM OF INTEREST INCOME AND CAPITAL GAINS ON THE DEBT INVESTMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, ON EQUITY INTERESTS THAT WE MAY ACQUIRE. WE EXPECT OUR DEBT INVESTMENTS, WHETHER IN THE FORM OF LEVERAGED LOANS OR MEZZANINE DEBT, TO HAVE  TERMS OF UP TO TEN YEARS, AND TO BEAR INTEREST AT EITHER A FIXED OR FLOATING RATE. INTEREST ON DEBT WILL BE PAYABLE GENERALLY EITHER QUARTERLY OR SEMI-ANNUALLY. IN SOME CASES, OUR DEBT OR PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR A PORTION OR ALL  OF THE INTEREST TO BE PIK. TO THE EXTENT INTEREST IS PIK, IT WILL BE PAYABLE THROUGH THE INCREASE OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE OBLIGATION BY THE AMOUNT OF  81  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST DUE ON THE THEN-OUTSTANDING AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SUCH OBLIGATION. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE DEBT AND ANY ACCRUED BUT UNPAID INTEREST WILL GENERALLY BECOME DUE AT THE MATURITY  DATE. IN ADDITION, WE MAY GENERATE REVENUE IN THE FORM OF COMMITMENT, ORIGINATION, STRUCTURING OR DILIGENCE FEES, FEES FOR PROVIDING MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE OR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND POSSIBLY CONSULTING FEES. ANY SUCH FEES WILL BE  GENERATED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INVESTMENTS AND RECOGNIZED AS EARNED. WE MAY ALSO INVEST IN PREFERRED EQUITY OR COMMON EQUITY SECURITIES THAT PAY DIVIDENDS ON A CURRENT BASIS.  ON JANUARY 22, 2008, WE ENTERED INTO A COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH SARATOGA CLO, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE ACT AS ITS COLLATERAL  MANAGER. THE SARATOGA CLO WAS INITIALLY REFINANCED IN OCTOBER 2013 WITH ITS REINVESTMENT PERIOD EXTENDED TO OCTOBER 2016. ON NOVEMBER 15, 2016, WE COMPLETED A SECOND REFINANCING OF THE SARATOGA CLO WITH ITS REINVESTMENT PERIOD EXTENDED TO  OCTOBER 2018.  ON DECEMBER 14, 2018, WE COMPLETED A THIRD REFINANCING AND UPSIZE OF THE SARATOGA CLO. THE THIRD SARATOGA CLO  REFINANCING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EXTENDED ITS REINVESTMENT PERIOD TO JANUARY 2021, AND EXTENDED ITS LEGAL MATURITY DATE TO JANUARY 2030. A  NON-CALL  PERIOD OF JANUARY 2020 WAS ALSO ADDED. FOLLOWING THIS  REFINANCING, THE SARATOGA CLO PORTFOLIO INCREASED FROM APPROXIMATELY $300.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT TO APPROXIMATELY $500.0 MILLION OF PREDOMINANTLY SENIOR SECURED FIRST LIEN TERM LOANS. IN ADDITION TO REFINANCING ITS  LIABILITIES, WE INVESTED AN ADDITIONAL $13.8 MILLION IN ALL OF THE NEWLY ISSUED SUBORDINATED NOTES OF THE SARATOGA CLO AND ALSO PURCHASED $2.5 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE  CLASS F-R-2  AND $7.5 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE  CLASS G-R-2  NOTES TRANCHES AT PAR, WITH A  COUPON OF LIBOR PLUS 8.75% AND LIBOR PLUS 10.00%, RESPECTIVELY. AS PART OF THIS REFINANCING, WE ALSO REDEEMED OUR EXISTING $4.5 MILLION AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE CLASS F NOTES TRANCHE AT PAR.  THE SARATOGA CLO REMAINS EFFECTIVELY 100% OWNED AND MANAGED BY SARATOGA INVESTMENT CORP. WE RECEIVE A BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.10% PER ANNUM  AND A SUBORDINATED MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.40% PER ANNUM OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SARATOGA CLO\u2019S ASSETS, PAID QUARTERLY TO THE EXTENT OF AVAILABLE PROCEEDS. PRIOR TO THE SECOND REFINANCING AND THE ISSUANCE OF THE  2013-1  AMENDED CLO NOTES, WE RECEIVED A BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.25% PER ANNUM AND A SUBORDINATED MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.25% PER ANNUM OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SARATOGA CLO\u2019S ASSETS, PAID QUARTERLY  TO THE EXTENT OF AVAILABLE PROCEEDS.  FOLLOWING THE THIRD REFINANCING AND THE ISSUANCE OF THE  2013-1  RESET CLO NOTES ON DECEMBER 14, 2018, WE ARE NO LONGER ENTITLED TO AN INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE EQUAL TO 20.0% OF EXCESS CASH FLOW TO THE EXTENT THE SARATOGA CLO SUBORDINATED NOTES RECEIVE AN  INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN PAID IN CASH EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 12.0%.  INTEREST INCOME ON OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO IS RECORDED USING  THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ASC TOPIC  325-40,  INVESTMENTS-OTHER, BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS  (\u201cASC  325-40\u201d),  BASED ON THE ANTICIPATED YIELD AND THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS OVER THE PROJECTED LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT. YIELDS ARE REVISED WHEN THERE ARE CHANGES IN ACTUAL OR ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS DUE TO CHANGES  IN PREPAYMENTS AND/OR  RE-INVESTMENTS,  CREDIT LOSSES OR ASSET PRICING. CHANGES IN ESTIMATED YIELD ARE RECOGNIZED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE ESTIMATED YIELD OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT FROM THE DATE  THE ESTIMATED YIELD WAS CHANGED.  ASC 606  IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ASU  2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (\u201cASC  606\u201d), WHICH SUPERSEDES THE REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS IN REVENUE RECOGNITION (ASC 605). UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT  REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN MAY 2016, ASU  2016-12  AMENDED ASU  2014-09  AND DEFERRED  THE EFFECTIVE PERIOD FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017. MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE MAJORITY OF ITS REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE SCOPED OUT OF ASC 606, AND HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT  IMPACT RELATES TO THE TIMING OF THE RECOGNITION OF THE CLO INCENTIVE FEE INCOME. WE ADOPTED ASC 606 UNDER THE MODIFIED  82  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH USING THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT PROVIDED FOR, THEREFORE THE PRESENTATION OF PRIOR PERIODS HAS NOT BEEN ADJUSTED.  EXPENSES  OUR PRIMARY OPERATING  EXPENSES INCLUDE THE PAYMENT OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT FEES, PROFESSIONAL FEES, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS INSURANCE, FEES PAID TO INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND ADMINISTRATOR EXPENSES, INCLUDING OUR ALLOCABLE PORTION OF OUR ADMINISTRATOR\u2019S  OVERHEAD. OUR INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT FEES COMPENSATE OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER FOR ITS WORK IN IDENTIFYING, EVALUATING, NEGOTIATING, CLOSING AND MONITORING OUR INVESTMENTS. WE BEAR ALL OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES OF OUR OPERATIONS AND  TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO.  \u2022  ORGANIZATION;  \u2022  CALCULATING OUR NET ASSET VALUE (INCLUDING THE COST AND EXPENSES OF ANY INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM);  \u2022  EXPENSES INCURRED BY OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING AGENTS, CONSULTANTS OR OTHER  ADVISERS, IN MONITORING OUR FINANCIAL AND LEGAL AFFAIRS AND IN MONITORING OUR INVESTMENTS AND PERFORMING DUE DILIGENCE ON OUR PROSPECTIVE PORTFOLIO COMPANIES;  \u2022  EXPENSES INCURRED BY OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER PAYABLE FOR TRAVEL AND DUE DILIGENCE ON OUR PROSPECTIVE PORTFOLIO  COMPANIES;  \u2022  INTEREST PAYABLE ON DEBT, IF ANY, INCURRED TO FINANCE OUR INVESTMENTS;  \u2022  OFFERINGS OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES;  \u2022  INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT FEES;  \u2022  FEES PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING AGENTS, CONSULTANTS OR OTHER ADVISERS, RELATING TO, OR ASSOCIATED WITH,  EVALUATING AND MAKING INVESTMENTS;  \u2022  TRANSFER AGENT AND CUSTODIAL FEES;  \u2022  FEDERAL AND STATE REGISTRATION FEES;  \u2022  ALL COSTS OF REGISTRATION AND LISTING OUR COMMON STOCK ON ANY SECURITIES EXCHANGE;  \u2022  FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES;  \u2022  INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS\u2019 FEES AND EXPENSES;  \u2022  COSTS OF PREPARING AND FILING REPORTS OR OTHER DOCUMENTS REQUIRED BY GOVERNMENTAL BODIES (INCLUDING THE U.S.  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) AND THE SBA);  \u2022  COSTS OF ANY REPORTS, PROXY STATEMENTS OR OTHER NOTICES TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDING PRINTING COSTS;  \u2022  OUR FIDELITY BOND, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS ERRORS AND OMISSIONS LIABILITY INSURANCE, AND ANY OTHER INSURANCE  PREMIUMS;  \u2022  DIRECT COSTS AND EXPENSES OF ADMINISTRATION, INCLUDING PRINTING, MAILING, LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE, COPYING,  SECRETARIAL AND OTHER STAFF, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS AND OUTSIDE LEGAL COSTS; AND  \u2022  ADMINISTRATION FEES AND ALL OTHER EXPENSES INCURRED BY US OR, IF APPLICABLE, THE ADMINISTRATOR IN CONNECTION WITH  ADMINISTERING OUR BUSINESS (INCLUDING PAYMENTS UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT BASED UPON OUR ALLOCABLE PORTION OF THE ADMINISTRATOR\u2019S OVERHEAD IN PERFORMING ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER AN ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT, INCLUDING RENT AND THE ALLOCABLE  PORTION OF THE COST OF OUR OFFICERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE STAFFS (INCLUDING TRAVEL EXPENSES)).  PURSUANT TO THE INVESTMENT  ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT THAT WE HAD WITH GSCP (NJ), L.P., OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER AND ADMINISTRATOR, WE HAD AGREED TO PAY GSCP (NJ), L.P. AS INVESTMENT ADVISER A  83  TABLE OF CONTENTS  QUARTERLY BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OF 1.75% OF THE AVERAGE VALUE OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS (OTHER THAN CASH OR CASH EQUIVALENTS BUT INCLUDING ASSETS PURCHASED WITH BORROWED FUNDS) AT THE END OF THE TWO MOST  RECENTLY COMPLETED FISCAL QUARTERS AND AN INCENTIVE FEE.  THE INCENTIVE FEE HAD TWO PARTS.  \u2022  A FEE, PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ARREARS, EQUAL TO 20.0% OF OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPRESSED AS A RATE OF RETURN ON THE VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS AT THE END OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING QUARTER, THAT EXCEEDED A 1.875% QUARTERLY HURDLE RATE MEASURED AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER. UNDER THIS  PROVISION, IN ANY FISCAL QUARTER, OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER RECEIVED NO INCENTIVE FEE UNLESS OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME EXCEEDED THE HURDLE RATE OF 1.875%. AMOUNTS RECEIVED AS A RETURN OF CAPITAL  WERE NOT INCLUDED IN CALCULATING THIS PORTION OF THE INCENTIVE FEE. SINCE THE HURDLE RATE WAS BASED ON NET ASSETS, A RETURN OF LESS THAN THE HURDLE RATE ON TOTAL ASSETS COULD STILL HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCENTIVE FEE.  \u2022  A FEE, PAYABLE AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, EQUAL TO 20.0% OF OUR NET REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, COMPUTED  NET OF ALL REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES AND UNREALIZED CAPITAL DEPRECIATION, IN EACH CASE ON A CUMULATIVE BASIS ON EACH INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY\u2019S PORTFOLIO, LESS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEES PAID TO THE INVESTMENT ADVISER  THROUGH SUCH DATE.  WE DEFERRED CASH PAYMENT OF ANY INCENTIVE FEE OTHERWISE EARNED BY OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER IF,  DURING THE THEN MOST RECENT FOUR FULL FISCAL QUARTERS ENDING ON OR PRIOR TO THE DATE SUCH PAYMENT WAS TO BE MADE, THE SUM OF (A) OUR AGGREGATE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND (B) OUR CHANGE IN NET ASSETS (DEFINED AS TOTAL ASSETS LESS  LIABILITIES) (BEFORE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY INCENTIVE FEES PAYABLE DURING THAT PERIOD) WAS LESS THAN 7.5% OF OUR NET ASSETS AT THE BEGINNING OF SUCH PERIOD. THESE CALCULATIONS WERE APPROPRIATELY  PRO-RATED  FOR  THE FIRST THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF OPERATION AND ADJUSTED FOR ANY SHARE ISSUANCES OR REPURCHASES DURING THE APPLICABLE PERIOD. SUCH INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BECOME PAYABLE ON THE NEXT DATE ON WHICH SUCH TEST HAD BEEN SATISFIED FOR THE MOST RECENT FOUR  FULL FISCAL QUARTERS OR UPON CERTAIN TERMINATIONS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. WE COMMENCED DEFERRING CASH PAYMENT OF INCENTIVE FEES DURING THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2007 AND CONTINUED TO DEFER SUCH PAYMENTS  THROUGH THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2010. AS OF JULY 30, 2010, THE DATE ON WHICH GSCP (NJ), L.P. CEASED TO BE OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER AND ADMINISTRATOR, WE OWED GSCP (NJ), L.P. $2.9 MILLION IN FEES FOR SERVICES PREVIOUSLY  PROVIDED TO US; OF WHICH $0.3 MILLION HAS BEEN PAID BY US. GSCP (NJ), L.P. AGREED TO WAIVE PAYMENT BY US OF THE REMAINING $2.6 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSUMMATION OF THE STOCK PURCHASE TRANSACTION WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS  AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT.  THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT  WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT ADVISER, ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WE HAD ENTERED INTO WITH GSCP (NJ), L.P., OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER, EXCEPT FOR THE  FOLLOWING MATERIAL DISTINCTIONS IN THE FEE TERMS.  \u2022  THE CAPITAL GAINS PORTION OF THE INCENTIVE FEE WAS RESET WITH RESPECT TO GAINS AND LOSSES FROM MAY 31, 2010,  AND THEREFORE LOSSES AND GAINS INCURRED PRIOR TO SUCH TIME WILL NOT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN CALCULATING THE CAPITAL GAINS FEE PAYABLE TO SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND, AS A RESULT, SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS WILL BE ENTITLED TO 20.0% OF NET  GAINS THAT ARISE AFTER MAY 31, 2010. IN ADDITION, THE COST BASIS FOR COMPUTING REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS HELD BY US AS OF MAY 31, 2010 EQUAL THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENT AS OF SUCH DATE. UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY  AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER, GSCP (NJ), L.P., THE CAPITAL GAINS FEE WAS CALCULATED FROM MARCH 21, 2007, AND THE GAINS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY OUTWEIGHED BY LOSSES.  \u2022  UNDER THE \u201cCATCH UP\u201d PROVISION, 100.0% OF OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE  NET INVESTMENT INCOME WITH RESPECT TO THAT PORTION OF SUCH  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME THAT EXCEEDS 1.875% BUT IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 2.344% IN ANY FISCAL QUARTER IS PAYABLE TO SARATOGA  INVESTMENT ADVISORS. THIS WILL ENABLE SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS TO RECEIVE 20.0% OF ALL NET INVESTMENT INCOME AS SUCH AMOUNT  84  TABLE OF CONTENTS  APPROACHES 2.344% IN ANY QUARTER, AND SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS WILL RECEIVE 20.0% OF ANY ADDITIONAL NET INVESTMENT INCOME. UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR  FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER, GSCP (NJ), L.P. ONLY RECEIVED 20.0% OF THE EXCESS NET INVESTMENT INCOME OVER 1.875%.  \u2022  WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE DEFERRAL RIGHTS REGARDING INCENTIVE FEES IN THE EVENT THAT THE DISTRIBUTIONS TO  STOCKHOLDERS AND CHANGE IN NET ASSETS IS LESS THAN 7.5% FOR THE PRECEDING FOUR FISCAL QUARTERS.  CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE  THE COMPANY RECORDS AN EXPENSE ACCRUAL RELATING TO THE CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE PAYABLE BY THE COMPANY TO ITS MANAGER WHEN THE UNREALIZED  GAINS ON ITS INVESTMENTS EXCEED ALL REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES ON ITS INVESTMENTS GIVEN THE FACT THAT A CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BE OWED TO THE MANAGER IF THE COMPANY WERE TO LIQUIDATE ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT SUCH TIME. THE ACTUAL  INCENTIVE FEE PAYABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGER RELATED TO CAPITAL GAINS WILL BE DETERMINED AND PAYABLE IN ARREARS AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR AND WILL INCLUDE ONLY REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS FOR THE PERIOD.  REGULATORY MATTERS  IN AUGUST 2018, THE  SEC ISSUED FINAL RULE RELEASE  NO.33-10532,  DISCLOSURE UPDATE AND SIMPLIFICATION  , WHICH IN PART AMENDS CERTAIN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF REGULATION  S-X  THAT HAVE  BECOME REDUNDANT, DUPLICATIVE, OVERLAPPING, OUTDATED, OR SUPERSEDED, IN LIGHT OF OTHER COMMISSION DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, U.S. GAAP OR CHANGES IN THE INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT. THE AMENDMENTS ARE INTENDED TO FACILITATE THE DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION  TO INVESTORS AND SIMPLIFY COMPLIANCE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERING THE TOTAL MIX OF INFORMATION PROVIDED TO INVESTORS. THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR THESE DISCLOSURES WAS NOVEMBER 5, 2018, EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER THAT BEGINS AFTER THE  EFFECTIVE DATE. MANAGEMENT HAS ADOPTED THESE AMENDMENTS AS CURRENTLY REQUIRED AND THESE ARE REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. THE PRESENTATION OF CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR INFORMATION HAS BEEN  ADJUSTED TO CONFORM WITH THESE AMENDMENTS.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN AUGUST 2018, FASB ISSUED ASU  2018-13  , FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820): DISCLOSURE  FRAMEWORK\u2014CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  (\u201cASU  2018-13\u201d).  THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF ASU  2018-13  IS TO IMPROVE THE  EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE CHANGES AFFECT ALL COMPANIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT DISCLOSURES. IN GENERAL, THE AMENDMENTS IN ASU  2018-13  ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL ENTITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019. AN ENTITY IS PERMITTED TO EARLY ADOPT THE REMOVED OR MODIFIED  DISCLOSURES UPON THE ISSUANCE OF ASU  2018-13  AND MAY DELAY ADOPTION OF THE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, WHICH ARE REQUIRED FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES ONLY, UNTIL THEIR EFFECTIVE DATE. MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THESE  CHANGES AND DOES NOT BELIEVE THEY WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES.  IN MARCH 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU  2017-08,  RECEIVABLES \u2014 NONREFUNDABLE FEES AND OTHER COSTS  (SUBTOPIC  310-20),  PREMIUM AMORTIZATION ON PURCHASED CALLABLE DEBT SECURITIES  (\u201cASU  2017-08\u201d)  WHICH AMENDS THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR CERTAIN PURCHASED  CALLABLE DEBT SECURITIES HELD AT A PREMIUM, SHORTENING SUCH PERIOD TO THE EARLIEST CALL DATE. ASU  2017-08  DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY ACCOUNTING CHANGE FOR DEBT SECURITIES HELD AT A DISCOUNT; THE DISCOUNT CONTINUES  TO BE AMORTIZED TO MATURITY. ASU  2017-08  IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. MANAGEMENT HAS ASSESSED THESE CHANGES AND  CONCLUDED THESE CHANGES DO NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES.  85  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW  MAY 31, 2019  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  ($ IN MILLIONS)  NUMBER OF INVESTMENTS(1)  66  58  NUMBER OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES(2)  33  31  AVERAGE INVESTMENT PER PORTFOLIO COMPANY(2)  $11.3  $11.8  AVERAGE INVESTMENT SIZE(1)  $5.8  $6.5  WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY(3)  3.5YRS  3.6YRS  NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES  8  8  NON-PERFORMING  OR DELINQUENT INVESTMENTS (FAIR  VALUE)  $4.8  $5.7  FIXED RATE DEBT (% OF INTEREST EARNING PORTFOLIO)(3)  $56.8(16.7%)  $55.7(16.3%)  FIXED RATE DEBT (WEIGHTED AVERAGE CURRENT COUPON)(3)  10.4%  10.4%  FLOATING RATE DEBT (% OF INTEREST EARNING PORTFOLIO)(3)  $284.0(83.3%)  $285.0(83.7%)  FLOATING RATE DEBT (WEIGHTED AVERAGE CURRENT SPREAD OVER LIBOR)(3)(4)  8.5%  8.6%  (1)  EXCLUDES OUR INVESTMENT IN THE SUBORDINATED NOTES OF SARATOGA CLO.

IN THIS REGARD, BECAUSE OUR  COMMON STOCK HAS HISTORICALLY TRADED AT A PRICE BELOW OUR CURRENT NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE AND WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE BELOW NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE, WE HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE LIMITED IN OUR  ABILITY TO RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL.

TO FUND GROWTH IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IN THE FUTURE, WE ANTICIPATE NEEDING TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FROM VARIOUS SOURCES, INCLUDING THE EQUITY MARKETS AND OTHER DEBT-RELATED MARKETS, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE  AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL.  CONSEQUENTLY, WE MAY NOT HAVE THE FUNDS OR THE ABILITY TO FUND NEW INVESTMENTS, TO MAKE  ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, TO FUND OUR UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO PORTFOLIO COMPANIES OR TO REPAY BORROWINGS. ALSO, THE ILLIQUIDITY OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO SELL THESE INVESTMENTS WHEN DESIRED  AND, IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO SELL THESE INVESTMENTS, WE MAY REALIZE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THEIR RECORDED VALUE.  MADISON REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF THE TERMS OF THE SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WE ENTERED INTO WITH MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC  (THE \u201cCREDIT FACILITY\u201d) ON JUNE 30, 2010, WHICH WAS MOST RECENTLY AMENDED ON MAY 18, 2017.  AVAILABILITY.  THE  COMPANY CAN DRAW UP TO THE LESSER OF (I) $40.0 MILLION (THE \u201cFACILITY AMOUNT\u201d) AND (II) THE PRODUCT OF THE APPLICABLE ADVANCE RATE (WHICH VARIES FROM 50.0% TO 75.0% DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF LOAN ASSET) AND THE VALUE, DETERMINED  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cADJUSTED BORROWING VALUE\u201d), OF CERTAIN  94  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d LOAN ASSETS PLEDGED AS SECURITY FOR THE LOAN (THE \u201cBORROWING BASE\u201d), IN EACH CASE LESS (A) THE AMOUNT OF ANY UNDRAWN FUNDING COMMITMENTS THE COMPANY HAS UNDER  ANY LOAN ASSET AND WHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY AMOUNTS IN THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT REFERRED TO BELOW (THE \u201cUNFUNDED EXPOSURE AMOUNT\u201d) AND OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS. EACH LOAN ASSET HELD BY THE COMPANY AS OF THE DATE ON WHICH THE CREDIT  FACILITY WAS CLOSED WAS VALUED AS OF THAT DATE AND EACH LOAN ASSET THAT THE COMPANY ACQUIRES AFTER SUCH DATE WILL BE VALUED AT THE LOWEST OF ITS FAIR VALUE, ITS FACE VALUE (EXCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST) AND THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR SUCH LOAN ASSET.  ADJUSTMENTS TO THE VALUE OF A LOAN ASSET WILL BE MADE TO REFLECT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN ITS FAIR VALUE, A DEFAULT BY THE OBLIGOR ON THE LOAN ASSET, INSOLVENCY OF THE OBLIGOR, ACCELERATION OF THE LOAN ASSET, AND CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS TO THE  TERMS OF THE LOAN ASSET.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPE OF LOAN ASSETS THAT ARE \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d TO BE INCLUDED  IN THE BORROWING BASE AND AS TO THE CONCENTRATION LEVEL OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF LOAN ASSETS IN THE BORROWING BASE SUCH AS RESTRICTIONS ON GEOGRAPHIC AND INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS, ASSET SIZE AND QUALITY, PAYMENT FREQUENCY, STATUS AND TERMS, AVERAGE  LIFE, AND COLLATERAL INTERESTS. IN ADDITION, IF AN ASSET IS TO REMAIN AN \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d LOAN ASSET, THE COMPANY MAY NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THE PAYMENT, AMORTIZATION, COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN OTHER TERMS OF THE LOAN ASSETS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE  ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT THAT WILL EITHER RESULT IN SUBORDINATION OF THE LOAN ASSET OR BE MATERIALLY ADVERSE TO THE LENDERS.  COLLATERAL.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY (OTHER THAN ASSETS HELD BY OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY) AND INCLUDES THE SUBORDINATED NOTES (\u201cCLO NOTES\u201d) ISSUED BY SARATOGA CLO AND THE COMPANY\u2019S RIGHTS  UNDER THE CLO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED BELOW).  INTEREST RATE AND FEES.  UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, FUNDS ARE BORROWED FROM  OR THROUGH CERTAIN LENDERS AT THE GREATER OF THE PREVAILING LIBOR RATE AND 1.00%, PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN OF 4.75%. AT THE COMPANY\u2019S OPTION, FUNDS MAY BE BORROWED BASED ON AN ALTERNATIVE BASE RATE, WHICH IN NO EVENT WILL BE LESS THAN 2.00%,  AND THE APPLICABLE MARGIN OVER SUCH ALTERNATIVE BASE RATE IS 3.75%. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PAYS THE LENDERS A COMMITMENT FEE OF 0.75% PER YEAR ON THE UNUSED AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE DURATION OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD (DEFINED BELOW).  ACCRUED INTEREST AND COMMITMENT FEES ARE PAYABLE MONTHLY. THE COMPANY WAS ALSO OBLIGATED TO PAY CERTAIN OTHER FEES TO THE LENDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING OF THE CREDIT FACILITY.  REVOLVING PERIOD AND MATURITY DATE.  THE COMPANY MAY MAKE AND REPAY BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS  FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cREVOLVING PERIOD\u201d). THE REVOLVING PERIOD MAY BE TERMINATED AT AN EARLIER TIME BY THE COMPANY OR, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, BY ACTION OF THE LENDERS OR AUTOMATICALLY. ALL  BORROWINGS AND OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY ARE DUE AND PAYABLE IN FULL FIVE YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD.  COLLATERAL TESTS.  IT IS A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO ANY BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY THAT THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER  THE CREDIT FACILITY, AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE PROPOSED BORROWINGS, NOT EXCEED THE LESSER OF THE BORROWING BASE OR THE FACILITY AMOUNT (THE \u201cBORROWING BASE TEST\u201d). IN ADDITION TO SATISFYING THE BORROWING BASE TEST, THE FOLLOWING TESTS  MUST ALSO BE SATISFIED (TOGETHER WITH BORROWING BASE TEST, THE \u201cCOLLATERAL TESTS\u201d).  \u2022  INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO.  THE RATIO (EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE) OF INTEREST COLLECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO  PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS, LESS CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSES RELATING TO THE CREDIT FACILITY, TO ACCRUED INTEREST AND COMMITMENT FEES AND ANY BREAKAGE COSTS PAYABLE TO THE LENDERS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE LAST 6 PAYMENT PERIODS MUST EQUAL AT LEAST  175.0%.  \u2022  OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO.  THE RATIO (EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE) OF THE AGGREGATE ADJUSTED BORROWING  VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS PLUS THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN INELIGIBLE PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS AND THE CLO NOTES (IN EACH CASE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS) TO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY PLUS THE UNFUNDED  EXPOSURE AMOUNT MUST EQUAL AT LEAST 200.0%.  \u2022  WEIGHTED AVERAGE FMV TEST.  THE AGGREGATE ADJUSTED OR WEIGHTED VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN  ASSETS AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE AGGREGATE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS  95  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MUST BE EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 72.0% AND 80.0% DURING THE  ONE-YEAR  PERIODS PRIOR TO THE FIRST AND SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE, RESPECTIVELY,  AND 85.0% AT ALL TIMES THEREAFTER.  THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO REQUIRES PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OR REPLACEMENT  OF PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S BREACH OF ITS REPRESENTATION AND WARRANTY THAT PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS INCLUDED IN THE BORROWING BASE ARE \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d LOAN ASSETS. SUCH PAYMENTS OR REPLACEMENTS MUST EQUAL THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT  BY WHICH THE BORROWING BASE IS OVERSTATED AS A RESULT OF SUCH BREACH OR ANY DEFICIENCY UNDER THE COLLATERAL TESTS AT THE TIME OF REPAYMENT OR REPLACEMENT. COMPLIANCE WITH THE COLLATERAL TESTS IS ALSO A CONDITION TO THE DISCRETIONARY SALE OF PLEDGED  LOAN ASSETS BY THE COMPANY.  PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS.  DURING THE REVOLVING PERIOD, THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS PROVISIONS OF THE CREDIT  FACILITY REQUIRE, AFTER PAYMENT OF SPECIFIED FEES AND EXPENSES AND ANY NECESSARY FUNDING OF THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT, THAT COLLECTIONS OF PRINCIPAL FROM THE LOAN ASSETS AND, TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE ARE INSUFFICIENT, COLLECTIONS OF INTEREST  FROM THE LOAN ASSETS, BE APPLIED ON EACH PAYMENT DATE TO PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS IF THE BORROWING BASE TEST, THE OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO AND THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE MET. SIMILARLY, FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF  THE REVOLVING PERIOD, COLLECTIONS OF INTEREST ARE REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED, AFTER PAYMENT OF CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSES, TO CURE ANY DEFICIENCIES IN THE BORROWING BASE TEST, THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND THE OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO AS OF THE  RELEVANT PAYMENT DATE.  RESERVE ACCOUNT.  THE CREDIT FACILITY REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO SET ASIDE AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE SUM OF  ACCRUED INTEREST, COMMITMENT FEES AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES DUE AND PAYABLE ON THE NEXT SUCCEEDING THREE PAYMENT DATES (OR CORRESPONDING TO THREE PAYMENT PERIODS). IF FOR ANY MONTHLY PERIOD DURING WHICH FEES AND OTHER PAYMENTS ACCRUE, THE  AGGREGATE ADJUSTED BORROWING VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS WHICH DO NOT PAY CASH INTEREST AT LEAST QUARTERLY EXCEEDS 15.0% OF THE AGGREGATE ADJUSTED BORROWING VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY IS  REQUIRED TO SET ASIDE SUCH INTEREST AND FEES DUE AND PAYABLE ON THE NEXT SUCCEEDING SIX PAYMENT DATES. AMOUNTS IN THE RESERVE ACCOUNT CAN BE APPLIED SOLELY TO THE PAYMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES, COMMITMENT FEES, ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST AND  ANY BREAKAGE COSTS PAYABLE TO THE LENDERS.  UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT.  WITH RESPECT TO REVOLVER OR DELAYED DRAW LOAN ASSETS, THE  COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO SET ASIDE IN A DESIGNATED ACCOUNT (THE \u201cUNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT\u201d) 100.0% OF ITS OUTSTANDING AND UNDRAWN FUNDING COMMITMENTS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH LOAN ASSETS. THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT IS FUNDED AT THE TIME THE  COMPANY ACQUIRES A REVOLVER OR DELAYED DRAW LOAN ASSET AND REQUESTS A RELATED BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT IS FUNDED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PROCEEDS OF THE REQUESTED BORROWING AND OTHER COMPANY FUNDS, AND IF  FOR ANY REASON SUCH AMOUNTS ARE INSUFFICIENT, THROUGH APPLICATION OF THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENT PROVISIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  OPERATING  EXPENSES.  THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS PROVISION OF THE CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES FOR THE PAYMENT OF CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE COMPANY OUT OF COLLECTIONS ON PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST DURING THE REVOLVING PERIOD AND OUT OF COLLECTIONS ON INTEREST  FOLLOWING THE TERMINATION OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRIORITY ESTABLISHED IN SUCH PROVISION. THE OPERATING EXPENSES PAYABLE PURSUANT TO THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENT PROVISIONS IS LIMITED TO $350,000 FOR EACH MONTHLY PAYMENT DATE OR  $2.5 MILLION FOR THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING PERIOD OF TWELVE CONSECUTIVE MONTHLY PAYMENT DATES. THIS CEILING CAN BE INCREASED BY THE LESSER OF 5.0% OR THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ALL THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS ONLY ON THE  FIRST MONTHLY PAYMENT DATE TO OCCUR AFTER EACH  ONE-YEAR  ANNIVERSARY FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE CREDIT FACILITY. UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A MANAGER EVENT (DESCRIBED BELOW), THE CONSENT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO PAY OPERATING EXPENSES THROUGH THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS PROVISION.  EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  THE CREDIT  FACILITY CONTAINS CERTAIN NEGATIVE COVENANTS, CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT. THE CREDIT FACILITY DOES NOT CONTAIN GRACE PERIODS FOR BREACH BY THE COMPANY OF CERTAIN COVENANTS, INCLUDING,  WITHOUT LIMITATION, PRESERVATION OF EXISTENCE, NEGATIVE PLEDGE, CHANGE OF NAME OR JURISDICTION AND SEPARATE LEGAL ENTITY STATUS OF THE COMPANY COVENANTS AND CERTAIN  96  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER CUSTOMARY COVENANTS.

CONDITIONS TO ACQUISITIONS AND PLEDGES OF LOAN ASSETS.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IMPOSES CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS TO THE ACQUISITION AND PLEDGE OF ADDITIONAL LOAN ASSETS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE COMPANY MAY NOT ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL LOAN ASSETS WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT INDICATES IN WRITING ITS SATISFACTION WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS\u2019 POLICIES, PERSONNEL AND PROCESSES RELATING TO THE LOAN ASSETS.  FEES AND EXPENSES.  THE COMPANY PAID CERTAIN FEES AND REIMBURSED MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC FOR THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ALL DOCUMENTED,  OUT-OF-POCKET  COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING THE REASONABLE FEES AND EXPENSES OF LAWYERS, INCURRED BY MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC IN CONNECTION WITH THE CREDIT FACILITY  AND THE CARRYING OUT OF ANY AND ALL ACTS CONTEMPLATED THEREUNDER UP TO AND AS OF THE DATE OF CLOSING OF THE STOCK PURCHASE TRANSACTION WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES. THESE AMOUNTS TOTALED $2.0 MILLION.  ON FEBRUARY 24, 2012, WE AMENDED OUR SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  EXPAND THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FROM $40.0 MILLION TO $45.0 MILLION;  \u2022  EXTEND THE PERIOD DURING WHICH WE MAY MAKE AND REPAY BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FROM JULY 30, 2013  TO FEBRUARY 24, 2015 (THE \u201cREVOLVING PERIOD\u201d). THE REVOLVING PERIOD MAY, UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT, BY ACTION OF THE LENDERS OR AUTOMATICALLY, BE TERMINATED. ALL BORROWINGS AND OTHER AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER THE CREDIT  FACILITY ARE DUE AND PAYABLE FIVE YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD; AND  97  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  REMOVE THE CONDITION THAT WE MAY NOT ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL LOAN ASSETS WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE  ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.  ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2014, WE ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDMENT TO THE REVOLVING FACILITY WITH  MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  EXTEND THE COMMITMENT TERMINATION DATE FROM FEBRUARY 24, 2015 TO SEPTEMBER 17, 2017;  \u2022  EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE OF THE REVOLVING FACILITY FROM FEBRUARY 24, 2020 TO SEPTEMBER 17, 2022 (UNLESS  TERMINATED SOONER UPON CERTAIN EVENTS);  \u2022  REDUCE THE APPLICABLE MARGIN RATE ON BASE RATE BORROWINGS FROM 4.50% TO 3.75%, AND ON LIBOR BORROWINGS FROM 5.50%  TO 4.75%; AND  \u2022  REDUCE THE FLOOR ON BASE RATE BORROWINGS FROM 3.00% TO 2.25%; AND ON LIBOR BORROWINGS FROM 2.00% TO 1.25%.  ON MAY 18, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A THIRD AMENDMENT TO THE CREDIT FACILITY WITH MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC TO,  AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  EXTEND THE COMMITMENT TERMINATION DATE FROM SEPTEMBER 17, 2017 TO SEPTEMBER 17, 2020;  \u2022  EXTEND THE FINAL MATURITY DATE OF THE CREDIT FACILITY FROM SEPTEMBER 17, 2022 TO SEPTEMBER 17, 2025;  \u2022  REDUCE THE FLOOR ON BASE RATE BORROWINGS FROM 2.25% TO 2.00%;  \u2022  REDUCE THE FLOOR ON LIBOR BORROWINGS FROM 1.25% TO 1.00%; AND  \u2022  REDUCE THE COMMITMENT FEE RATE FROM 0.75% TO 0.50% FOR ANY PERIOD DURING WHICH THE RATIO OF ADVANCES OUTSTANDING  TO AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS, EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE, IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 50%.  AS OF MAY 31, 2019, WE HAD  $0.0 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND $150.0 MILLION OF  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES OUTSTANDING (WHICH ARE DISCUSSED BELOW). AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE HAD NO  OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND $150.0 MILLION OF  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES OUTSTANDING. OUR BORROWING BASE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AT MAY 31, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS $27.3 MILLION AND $30.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  OUR ASSET COVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN THE 1940 ACT, WAS 238.9% AS OF  MAY 31, 2019 AND 234.5% AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES  IN ADDITION, WE, THROUGH A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, SOUGHT AND OBTAINED A LICENSE FROM THE SBA TO OPERATE AN SBIC. IN THIS REGARD, ON  MARCH 28, 2012, OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, SARATOGA INVESTMENT CORP. SBIC, LP, RECEIVED A LICENSE FROM THE SBA TO OPERATE AS AN SBIC UNDER SECTION 301(C) OF THE SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT ACT OF 1958. SBICS ARE DESIGNATED TO STIMULATE THE  FLOW OF PRIVATE EQUITY CAPITAL TO ELIGIBLE SMALL BUSINESSES. UNDER SBA REGULATIONS, SBICS MAY MAKE LOANS TO ELIGIBLE SMALL BUSINESSES AND INVEST IN THE EQUITY SECURITIES OF SMALL BUSINESSES.  THE SBIC LICENSE ALLOWS OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY TO OBTAIN LEVERAGE BY ISSUING  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES.  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES ARE  NON-RECOURSE,  INTEREST ONLY DEBENTURES WITH INTEREST PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY AND HAVE A  TEN-YEAR  MATURITY.  THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE PAID PRIOR TO MATURITY  BUT MAY BE PREPAID AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PENALTY. THE INTEREST RATE OF  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES IS FIXED ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS AT A MARKET-DRIVEN SPREAD OVER U.S. TREASURY NOTES WITH  TEN-YEAR  MATURITIES.  98  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SBA REGULATIONS CURRENTLY LIMIT THE AMOUNT THAT OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY MAY BORROW TO A MAXIMUM  OF $150.0 MILLION WHEN IT HAS AT LEAST $75.0 MILLION IN REGULATORY CAPITAL, RECEIVES A CAPITAL COMMITMENT FROM THE SBA AND HAS BEEN THROUGH AN EXAMINATION BY THE SBA SUBSEQUENT TO LICENSING. AS OF MAY 31, 2019, OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY HAD  $75.0 MILLION IN REGULATORY CAPITAL AND $150.0 MILLION  SBA-  GUARANTEED DEBENTURES OUTSTANDING.  WE RECEIVED EXEMPTIVE RELIEF FROM THE SEC TO PERMIT US TO EXCLUDE THE DEBT OF OUR SBIC SUBSIDIARY GUARANTEED BY THE SBA FROM THE DEFINITION OF  SENIOR SECURITIES IN THE ASSET COVERAGE TEST UNDER THE 1940 ACT. THIS ALLOWS US INCREASED FLEXIBILITY UNDER THE ASSET COVERAGE TEST BY PERMITTING US TO BORROW UP TO $150.0 MILLION MORE THAN WE WOULD OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO ABSENT THE RECEIPT OF  THIS EXEMPTIVE RELIEF. ON APRIL 16, 2018, AS PERMITTED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT AVAILABILITY ACT, WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON MARCH 23, 2018, OUR  NON-  INTERESTED BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED OF  OUR BECOMING SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM ASSET COVERAGE RATIO OF 150.0% FROM 200% UNDER SECTIONS 18(A)(1) AND 18(A)(2) OF THE 1940 ACT. THE 150.0% ASSET COVERAGE RATIO BECAME EFFECTIVE ON APRIL 16, 2019.  ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2018, THE SBA ISSUED A \u201cGREEN LIGHT\u201d LETTER INVITING US TO FILE A FORMAL LICENSE APPLICATION FOR A SECOND SBIC  LICENSE. IF APPROVED, THE ADDITIONAL SBIC LICENSE WOULD PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH AN INCREMENTAL SOURCE OF LONG-TERM CAPITAL BY PERMITTING US TO ISSUE, SUBJECT TO SBA APPROVAL, UP TO $175.0 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL  SBA-GUARANTEED  DEBENTURES IN ADDITION TO THE $150.0 MILLION ALREADY APPROVED UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S FIRST LICENSE. RECEIPT OF A GREEN LIGHT LETTER FROM THE SBA DOES NOT ASSURE AN APPLICANT THAT THE SBA  WILL ULTIMATELY ISSUE AN SBIC LICENSE AND THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED NO ASSURANCE OR INDICATION FROM THE SBA THAT IT WILL RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL SBIC LICENSE, OR OF THE TIMEFRAME IN WHICH IT WOULD RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL LICENSE, SHOULD ONE ULTIMATELY BE  GRANTED.  UNSECURED NOTES  IN  MAY 2013, WE ISSUED $48.3 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR 2020 NOTES FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $46.1 MILLION AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING COMMISSIONS OF $1.9 MILLION AND OFFERING COSTS OF $0.3 MILLION.

OUR COMPANY\u2019S VISION IS THAT OUR GUESTS, EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS STAY LOYAL TO OUR RESTAURANT BRANDS AND VALUE THEM AS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THEIR LIVES. WE WANT OUR COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE TO MAKE IT A LEADER IN OUR INDUSTRY.  WE ARE HEADQUARTERED IN HOUSTON, TEXAS. OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IS LOCATED AT 13111 NORTHWEST FREEWAY, SUITE 600, HOUSTON, TEXAS 77040, AND OUR TELEPHONE NUMBER AT THAT ADDRESS IS (713) 329-6800. OUR WEBSITE IS WWW.LUBYSINC.COM. THE INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE IS NOT, AND SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE, A PART OF THIS FORM 10-Q OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO ANY OF OUR OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SEC.  AS OF  JUNE 5, 2019  , WE OWNED AND OPERATED  130  RESTAURANTS, OF WHICH  80  ARE TRADITIONAL CAFETERIAS,  49  ARE GOURMET HAMBURGER RESTAURANTS, AND ONE IS A CASUAL DINING RESTAURANT AND BAR. THESE ESTABLISHMENTS ARE LOCATED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO RETAIL CENTERS, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS MOSTLY THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. INCLUDED IN THE  130  RESTAURANTS THAT WE OWN AND OPERATE ARE 12 RESTAURANTS LOCATED AT SIX PROPERTY LOCATIONS WHERE WE OPERATE A SIDE-BY-SIDE LUBY\u2019S CAFETERIA AND FUDDRUCKERS ON THE SAME PROPERTY. WE REFER TO THESE LOCATIONS AS \u201cCOMBO LOCATIONS.\u201d  AS OF  JUNE 5, 2019  , WE OPERATED  32  CULINARY CONTRACT SERVICES LOCATIONS. WE OPERATED 22 OF THESE LOCATIONS IN THE HOUSTON, TEXAS AREA, THREE IN THE TEXAS LOWER RIO GRANDE VALLEY, TWO IN DALLAS, TEXAS, AND TWO IN SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS AND ONE IN NORTHWEST TEXAS. OUTSIDE OF TEXAS WE OPERATED ONE LOCATION IN NORTH CAROLINA AND ONE IN KANSAS. LUBY\u2019S CULINARY CONTRACT SERVICES CURRENTLY PROVIDES FOOD SERVICE MANAGEMENT TO HOSPITALS, CORPORATE DINING FACILITIES, SPORTS STADIUMS, AND A SENIOR CARE FACILITY.  AS OF  JUNE 5, 2019  , WE HAD  42  FRANCHISEES OPERATING  107  FUDDRUCKERS RESTAURANTS. OUR LARGEST  SIX  FRANCHISE OWNERS OWN FIVE TO TWELVE RESTAURANTS EACH.  FOURTEEN  FRANCHISE OWNERS EACH OWN TWO TO FOUR RESTAURANTS. THE  22  REMAINING FRANCHISE OWNERS EACH OWN ONE RESTAURANT.  ACCOUNTING PERIODS  THE COMPANY\u2019S FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON THE LAST WEDNESDAY IN AUGUST. ACCORDINGLY, EACH FISCAL YEAR NORMALLY CONSISTS OF 13 FOUR-WEEK PERIODS, OR ACCOUNTING PERIODS, ACCOUNTING FOR 364 DAYS IN THE AGGREGATE. HOWEVER, EVERY FIFTH OR SIXTH YEAR, WE HAVE A FISCAL YEAR THAT CONSISTS OF 53 WEEKS, ACCOUNTING FOR 371 DAYS IN THE AGGREGATE. THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER CONSISTS OF FOUR FOUR-WEEK PERIODS, OR 16 WEEKS, AND THE REMAINING THREE QUARTERS TYPICALLY INCLUDES THREE FOUR-WEEK PERIODS, OR 12 WEEKS, IN LENGTH. THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER INCLUDES 13 WEEKS IN CERTAIN FISCAL YEARS TO ADJUST FOR OUR STANDARD 52 WEEK, OR 364 DAY, FISCAL YEAR COMPARED TO THE 365 DAY CALENDAR YEAR. COMPARABILITY BETWEEN QUARTERS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE VARYING LENGTHS OF THE QUARTERS, AS WELL AS THE SEASONALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS.  SAME-STORE SALES  THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT TO FOOD QUALITY, CONCEPT, LOCATION, PRICE, AND SERVICE, ALL OF WHICH MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON SAME-STORE SALES. OUR SAME-STORE SALES CALCULATION MEASURES THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF A CERTAIN GROUP OF RESTAURANTS. A RESTAURANT\u2019S SALES RESULTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE SAME-STORE SALES CALCULATION IN THE QUARTER AFTER A STORE HAS BEEN OPEN FOR SIX CONSECUTIVE FISCAL QUARTERS. STORES THAT CLOSE ON A PERMANENT BASIS (OR ON A TEMPORARY BASIS FOR REMODELING) ARE REMOVED FROM THE GROUP IN THE QUARTER WHEN OPERATIONS CEASE AT THE RESTAURANT, BUT REMAIN IN THE SAME-STORE GROUP FOR PREVIOUSLY REPORTED QUARTERS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS APPROACH LEADS TO MORE EFFECTIVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISONS, NEITHER THE TIME FRAME NOR THE EXACT PRACTICE MAY BE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY OTHER RESTAURANT COMPANIES.  33  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  QUARTER ENDED  JUNE 5, 2019  COMPARED TO QUARTER ENDED  JUNE 6, 2018  COMPARABILITY BETWEEN QUARTERS IS AFFECTED BY THE VARYING LENGTHS OF THE QUARTERS AND QUARTERS ENDING AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN THE CALENDAR YEAR WHEN SEASONAL PATTERNS FOR SALES ARE DIFFERENT.

OVERVIEW  THE FOLLOWING SECTION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH PART I, ITEM 1: CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THIS REPORT AS WELL AS PART I, ITEM 1: BUSINESS; AND PART II, ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THE COMPANY\u2019S 2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  COMPANY OVERVIEW  DELCATH SYSTEMS, INC. IS AN INTERVENTIONAL ONCOLOGY COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE TREATMENT OF PRIMARY AND METASTATIC LIVER CANCERS. OUR INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT\u2014MELPHALAN HYDROCHLORIDE FOR INJECTION FOR USE WITH THE DELCATH HEPATIC DELIVERY SYSTEM (\u201cMELPHALAN/HDS\u201d) \u2014IS DESIGNED TO ADMINISTER HIGH-DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY TO THE LIVER WHILE CONTROLLING SYSTEMIC EXPOSURE AND ASSOCIATED SIDE EFFECTS. IN EUROPE, OUR SYSTEM IS COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE UNDER THE TRADE NAME DELCATH HEPATIC CHEMOSAT  \u00ae  17  DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR MELPHALAN (  \u201c  CHEM  OSAT  \u201d  ), WHERE IT HAS BEEN USED AT MAJOR MEDICAL CENTERS TO TREAT A WIDE RANGE OF CANCERS OF THE LIVER.  OUR PRIMARY RESEARCH FOCUS IS ON OCULAR MELANOMA LIVER METASTASES (\u201cMOM\u201d) AND INTRAHEPATIC CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA (\u201cICC\u201d), A TYPE OF PRIMARY LIVER CANCER, AND CERTAIN OTHER CANCERS THAT ARE METASTATIC TO THE LIVER. WE BELIEVE THE DISEASE STATES WE ARE INVESTIGATING REPRESENT A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR GLOBAL MARKET OPPORTUNITY AND A CLEAR UNMET MEDICAL NEED.  OUR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (\u201cCDP\u201d) FOR MELPHALAN/HDS IS COMPRISED OF THE FOCUS CLINICAL TRIAL FOR PATIENTS WITH HEPATIC DOMINANT OCULAR MELANOMA (THE \u201cFOCUS TRIAL\u201d), A GLOBAL REGISTRATION CLINICAL TRIAL THAT IS INVESTIGATING OBJECTIVE RESPONSE RATE IN MOM, AND THE ALIGN TRIAL, A GLOBAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL FOR ICC (THE \u201cALIGN TRIAL\u201d). OUR CDP ALSO INCLUDES A REGISTRY FOR CHEMOSAT COMMERCIAL CASES PERFORMED IN EUROPE AND SPONSORSHIP OF SELECT INVESTIGATOR-INITIATED TRIALS (\u201cIITS\u201d).  THE DIRECTION AND FOCUS OF OUR CDP FOR CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS IS INFORMED BY; PRIOR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT CONDUCTED BETWEEN 2004 AND 2010, COMMERCIAL EXPERIENCE WITH CHEMOSAT CASES PERFORMED ON PATIENTS IN EUROPE, AND PRIOR REGULATORY ENGAGEMENT WITH THE FDA. EXPERIENCE GAINED FROM THIS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, EARLY EU  ROPEAN COMMERCIAL CASES AND UNITED STATES REGULATORY OPINION HAS LED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SEVERAL SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR PRODUCT AND THE ASSOCIATED MEDICAL PROCEDURE.  IN THE UNITED STATES, MELPHALAN/HDS IS CONSIDERED A COMBINATION DRUG AND DEVICE PRODUCT AND IS REGULATED AS A DRUG BY THE FDA. THE FDA HAS GRANTED US SIX ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATIONS, INCLUDING THREE ORPHAN DESIGNATIONS FOR THE USE OF THE DRUG MELPHALAN FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH MOM, HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA AND ICC. MELPHALAN/HDS  HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED FOR SALE IN THE UNITED STATES.  IN EUROPE, THE CURRENT VERSION OF OUR CHEMOSAT PRODUCT IS REGULATED AS A CLASS IIB MEDICAL DEVICE AND RECEIVED ITS CE MARK IN 2012. WE ARE IN AN EARLY PHASE OF COMMERCIALIZING THE CHEMOSAT SYSTEM IN SELECT MARKETS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) WHERE THE PROSPECT OF SECURING REIMBURSEMENT COVERAGE FOR THE PROCEDURE IS STRONGEST. IN 2015 NATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT COVERAGE FOR CHEMOSAT PROCEDURES WAS AWARDED IN GERMANY. IN 2016, COVERAGE LEVELS WERE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN HOSPITALS IN GERMANY AND REGIONAL SICKNESS FUNDS. COVERAGE LEVELS DETERMINED VIA THIS PROCESS ARE EXPECTED TO BE RENEGOTIATED ANNUALLY. IN 2017, DUTCH HEALTH AUTHORITIES ADDED CHEMOSAT TO THEIR TREATMENT GUIDELINES FOR PATIENTS WITH OCULAR MELANOMA M  ETASTATIC TO THE LIVER, AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARD EVENTUAL REIMBURSEMENT IN THE DUTCH MARKET.  CURRENTLY THERE ARE FEW EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR CERTAIN CANCERS IN THE LIVER. TRADITIONAL TREATMENT OPTIONS INCLUDE SURGERY, SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY, LIVER TRANSPLANT, RADIATION THERAPY, INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY TECHNIQUES, AND ISOLATED HEPATIC PERFUSION. WE BELIEVE THAT CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS REPRESENT A POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT ADVANCEMENT IN REGIONAL THERAPY FOR PRIMARY LIVER CANCER AND CERTAIN OTHER CANCERS METASTATIC TO THE LIVER AND ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO TREAT THE ENTIRE LIVER EITHER AS A STANDALONE THERAPY OR AS A COMPLEMENT TO OTHER THERAPIES.  CANCERS IN THE LIVER \u2013 A SIGNIFICANT UNMET NEED  CANCERS OF THE LIVER REMAIN A MAJOR UNMET MEDICAL NEED GLOBALLY.  ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY\u2019S (\u201cACS\u201d)  CANCER FACTS & FIGURES 2018  REPORT, CANCER IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH AN ESTIMATED 609,640 DEATHS AND 1.7 MILLION NEW CASES EXPECTED TO BE DIAGNOSED IN 2018. CANCER IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH WORLDWIDE, ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY 9.6 MILLION DEATHS AND 18.1 MILLION NEW CASES IN 2018 ACCORDING TO GLOBOCAN, THE DATABASE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CANCER REGISTRIES. THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF CANCER IS ENORMOUS FOR PATIENTS, THEIR FAMILIES AND SOCIETY. THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE QUALITY AND RESEARCH ESTIMATES THAT THE DIRECT MEDICAL COSTS (TOTAL OF ALL HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES) FOR CANCER IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2015 WAS $80.2 BILLION. THE LIVER IS OFTEN THE LIFE-LIMITING ORGAN FOR CANCER PATIENTS AND ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF CANCER DEATH. PATIENT PROGNOSIS IS GENERALLY POOR ONCE CANCER HAS SPREAD TO THE LIVER.  LIVER CANCERS\u2014INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY  THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF LIVER CANCERS: PRIMARY LIVER CANCER AND METASTATIC LIVER DISEASE. PRIMARY LIVER CANCER (HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA OR \u201cHCC\u201d, INCLUDING ICC, ORIGINATES IN THE LIVER OR BILIARY TISSUE AND IS PARTICULARLY PREVALENT IN POPULATIONS WHERE THE PRIMARY RISK FACTORS FOR THE DISEASE, SUCH AS HEPATITIS-B, HEPATITIS-C, HIGH LEVELS OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, AFLATOXIN, CIGARETTE SMOKING AND EXPOSURE TO INDUSTRIAL POLLUTANTS, ARE PRESENT. METASTATIC LIVER DISEASE, ALSO CALLED LIVER METASTASIS, OR SECONDARY LIVER CANCER, IS CHARACTERIZED BY MICROSCOPIC CANCER CELL CLUSTERS THAT DETACH FROM THE PRIMARY SITE OF DISEASE AND TRAVEL VIA THE BLOOD STREAM AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEM INTO THE LIVER, WHERE THEY GROW INTO NEW TUMORS. THESE METASTASES OFTEN CONTINUE TO GROW EVEN AFTER THE PRIMARY CANCER IN ANOTHER PART OF THE BODY HAS BEEN REMOVED.  GIVEN THE VITAL BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE LIVER, INCLUDING PROCESSING NUTRIENTS FROM FOOD AND FILTERING TOXINS FROM THE BLOOD, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR METASTASES TO SETTLE IN THE LIVER. IN MANY CASES PATIENTS DIE NOT AS A RESULT OF THEIR  18  PRIMARY CANCER, BUT FROM THE TUMORS THAT METASTASIZE TO THEIR LIVER.  IN THE UNITED STATES, METASTATIC LIVER DISEASE IS MORE PREVALENT THAN PRIMARY LIVER CANCER.  OCULAR MELANOMA  OCULAR MELANOMA IS ONE OF THE CANCER HISTOLOGIES WITH A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF METASTASIZING TO THE LIVER. BASED ON THIRD PARTY RESEARCH THAT WE COMMISSIONED IN 2018, WE ESTIMATE THAT UP TO 4,700 CASES OF OCULAR MELANOMA ARE DIAGNOSED IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE ANNUALLY, AND THAT APPROXIMATELY 55% OF THESE PATIENTS WILL DEVELOP METASTATIC DISEASE. OF METASTATIC CASES OF OCULAR MELANOMA, WE ESTIMATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 90% OF PATIENTS WILL DEVELOP LIVER INVOLVEMENT. ONCE OCULAR MELANOMA HAS SPREAD TO THE LIVER, CURRENT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS MEDIAN OVERALL SURVIVAL FOR THESE PATIENTS IS GENERALLY SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO STANDARD OF CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH OCULAR MELANOMA LIVER METASTASES. BASED ON THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN 2018, WE ESTIMATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 2,000 PATIENTS WITH OCULAR MELANOMA LIVER METASTASES IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR TREATMENT WITH THE MELPHALAN/HDS.  INTRAHEPATIC CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA  HEPATOBILIARY CANCERS INCLUDE HCC AND ICC, AND ARE AMONG THE MOST PREVALENT AND LETHAL FORMS OF CANCER. ACCORDING TO GLOBOCAN, AN ESTIMATED 78,500 NEW CASES OF HEPATOBILIARY CANCERS ARE DIAGNOSED IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE ANNUALLY. ACCORDING TO THE ACS, APPROXIMATELY 42,030 NEW CASES OF THESE CANCERS ARE EXPECTED TO BE DIAGNOSED IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2019, LEADING TO APPROXIMATELY 31,780 DEATHS.  ICC IS THE SECOND MOST COMMON PRIMARY LIVER TUMOR AND ACCOUNTS FOR 3% OF ALL GASTROINTESTINAL CANCERS AND 15% OF HEPATOBILIARY CASES DIAGNOSED IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE ANNUALLY.  WE BELIEVE THAT 90% OF ICC PATIENTS ARE NOT CANDIDATES FOR SURGICAL RESECTION, AND THAT APPROXIMATELY 20-30% OF THESE MAY BE CANDIDATES FOR CERTAIN FOCAL INTERVENTIONS. ACCORDING TO THIRD PARTY RESEARCH THAT WE COMMISSIONED IN 2018 WE ESTIMATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 9,300 ICC PATIENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE ANNUALLY COULD BE CANDIDATES FOR TREATMENT WITH MELPHALAN/HDS, WHICH WE BELIEVE REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT MARKET OPPORTUNITY.  ACCORDING TO THE ACS, THE OVERALL FIVE-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE FOR HEPATOBILIARY CANCERS IN THE UNITED STATES IS APPROXIMATELY 18%. FOR PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH A LOCALIZED STAGE OF DISEASE, THE ACS ESTIMATES 5-YEAR SURVIVAL AT 31%. THE ACS ESTIMATES THAT 5-YEAR SURVIVAL FOR ALL CANCERS IS 68%.  AB  OUT CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS  OUR PRODUCT ADMINISTERS CONCENTRATED REGIONAL CHEMOTHERAPY TO THE LIVER. THIS \u201cWHOLE ORGAN\u201d THERAPY IS PERFORMED BY ISOLATING THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM OF THE LIVER, INFUSING THE LIVER WITH A CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT, AND THEN FILTERING THE BLOOD PRIOR TO RETURNING IT TO THE PATIENT. DURING THE PROCEDURE, KNOWN AS PERCUTANEOUS HEPATIC PERFUSION, PHP  \u00ae  , (\u201cPHP THERAPY\u201d), THREE CATHETERS ARE PLACED PERCUTANEOUSLY THROUGH STANDARD INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY TECHNIQUES. THE CATHETERS TEMPORARILY ISOLATE THE LIVER FROM THE BODY\u2019S CIRCULATORY SYSTEM, ALLOW ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT MELPHALAN HYDROCHLORIDE DIRECTLY TO THE LIVER, AND COLLECT BLOOD EXITING THE LIVER FOR FILTRATION BY OUR PROPRIETARY FILTERS. THE FILTERS ABSOR  B CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT IN THE BLOOD, THEREBY REDUCING SYSTEMIC EXPOSURE TO THE DRUG AND RELATED TOXIC SIDE EFFECTS, BEFORE THE FILTERED BLOOD IS RETURNED TO THE PATIENT\u2019S CIRCULATORY SYSTEM.  PHP THERAPY IS PERFORMED IN AN INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY SUITE IN APPROXIMATELY TWO TO THREE HOURS. PATIENTS REMAIN IN AN INTENSIVE CARE OR STEP-DOWN UNIT OVERNIGHT FOR OBSERVATION FOLLOWING THE PROCEDURE. TREATMENT WITH CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS IS REPEATABLE, AND A NEW DISPOSABLE SYSTEM IS USED FOR EACH TREATMENT. PATIENTS TREATED IN CLINICAL SETTINGS ARE PERMITTED UP TO SIX TREATMENTS. IN COMMERCIAL TREATMENT SETTINGS, PATIENTS HAVE RECEIVED UP TO EIGHT TREATMENTS. IN THE UNITED STATES, MELPHALAN HYDROCHLORIDE FOR INJECTION WILL BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THE SYSTEM, IF APPROVED. IN EUROPE, THE SYSTEM IS SOLD SEPARATELY AND USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MELPHALAN HYDROCHLORIDE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FROM A THIRD PARTY. IN OUR CLINICAL TRIALS, MELPHALAN HYDROCHLORIDE FOR INJECTION IS PROVIDED TO BOTH EUROPEAN AND UNITED STATES CLINICAL TRIAL SITES.  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS PROCEDURE  AS WITH MANY CANCER THERAPIES, TREATMENT WITH CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS IS ASSOCIATED WITH ADVERSE EVENTS, SOME OF WHICH CAN BE POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING.  PROCEDUR  E AND PRODUCT REFINEMENTS  19  I  N 2012  ,  WE INTRODUCED THE GENERATION TWO VERSION OF THE CHEMOSAT SYSTEM, WHICH OFFERED IMPROVED HEMOFILTRATION AND OTHER  DEVICE COMPONENT  PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS.  REPORTS FROM TREATING PHYSICIANS IN BOTH EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES  USING THE GENERATION TWO CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS  ,  IN A COMMERCIAL SETTING  ,  HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THESE PRODUCT IMPROVEMENTS AND PROCEDURE REFINEMENTS HAVE IMPROVED THE SAFETY PROFILE.  SINCE  2017, PHYSICIANS IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES  HAVE  PRESENTED  AND PUBLISHED  THE RESULTS OF RESEARCH THAT SIGNALED AN IMPROVED SAFETY PROFILE  ,  AS WELL AS EFFICACY IN MULTIPLE TUMOR TYPES.  COLLECTION OF ADEQUATE SAFETY DATA ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROCEDURE IS A MAJOR FOCUS OF THE CLINICAL TRIALS IN OUR CURRENT CDP.  PRI  OR UNITED STATES REGULATORY EXPERIENCE  IN AUGUST 2012 WE SUBMITTED A NEW DRUG APPLICATION (\u201cNDA\u201d) UNDER SECTION 505(B)(2) OF THE FEDERAL FOOD DRUG COSMETIC ACT (FFDCA) SEEKING AN INDICATION FOR THE PERCUTANEOUS INTRA-ARTERIAL ADMINISTRATION OF MELPHALAN FOR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC MELANOMA IN THE LIVER, SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED TO OCULAR MELANOMA METASTATIC TO THE LIVER. DATA SUBMITTED TO THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) INCLUDED THE EARLY CLINICAL TRIAL VERSIONS OF THE SYSTEM, ALONG WITH EARLY CLINICAL PROCEDURE TECHNIQUES BASED ON RESEARCH CONDUCTED BETWEEN 2005 AND 2010. A FULL DISCOURSE OF THIS NDA SUBMISSION, INCLUDING THE OUTCOME OF AN ODAC PANEL ON MAY 2, 2013 AND THE FDA\u2019S ISSUANCE OF A COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER, IN SEPTEMBER 2013, IS PROVIDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  ACTIVE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  THE FOCUS OF OUR CDP IS TO GENERATE CLINICAL DATA FOR THE CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS IN VARIOUS DISEASE STATES AND VALIDATE THE SAFETY PROFILE OF THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE PRODUCT AND TREATMENT PROCEDURE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE IMPROVEMENTS WE HAVE MADE TO CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS AND TO THE PHP THERAPY HAVE ADDRESSED THE ADVERSE EVENT PROFILE AND PROCEDURE-RELATED RIS  KS OBSERVED DURING PREVIOUS PHASE 2 AND 3 CLINICAL TRIALS. OUR CDP IS ALSO DESIGNED TO SUPPORT CLINICAL ADOPTION OF AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR CHEMOSAT IN EUROPE, AND TO SUPPORT REGULATORY APPROVALS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES.  THE FOCUS TRIAL -  NCT02678572  ON JULY 27, 2018, AFTER EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH FDA, WE ANNOUNCED AN AMENDMENT TO OUR PHASE 3, RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL IN OCULAR MELANOMA LIVER METASTASES WHICH ALTERED THE TRIAL PROTOCOL TO A NON-RANDOMIZED, SINGLE-ARM STUDY. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AMENDMENT, THE TRIAL, NOW TITLED  A SINGLE-ARM, MULTI-CENTER, OPEN-LABEL STUDY TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY, SAFETY AND PHARMACOKINETICS OF MELPHALAN/HDS TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH HEPATIC-DOMINANT OCULAR MELANOMA  , WILL ENROLL A MINIMUM OF 80 PATIENTS WITH OCULAR MELANOMA METASTATIC TO THE LIVER. UNDER THE NEW PROTOCOL, THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT FOR THE AMENDED FOCUS TRIAL WILL BE OBJECTIVE RESPONSE RATE (\u201cORR\u201d). SECONDARY ENDPOINTS WILL INCLUDE DURATION OF RESPONSE, DISEASE CONTROL RATE, OVERALL SURVIVAL AND PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL. ADDITIONAL EXPLORATORY OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDE TIME TO OBJECTIVE RESPONSE, HEPATIC PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL, HEPATIC OBJECTIVE RESPONSE, AND QUALITY OF LIFE, SAFETY AND OTHER PHARMACOKINETIC MEASURES. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA REMAIN UNCHANGED. PATIENTS PREVIOUSLY ENROLLED IN THE MELPHALAN/HDS ARM OF THE TRIAL UNDER THE PREVIOUS PROTOCOL WILL CONTINUE TO BE TREATED AND STATISTICALLY EVALUATED AS PART OF THE AMENDED TRIAL.  THE RARITY OF OCULAR MELANOMA, ABSENCE OF CROSSOVER TO THE EXPERIMENTAL TRIAL ARM, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF PHP  \u00ae  THERAPY IN A COMMERCIAL SETTING IN EUROPE HAVE ALL COMBINED TO IMPEDE ENROLLMENT IN THIS TRIAL UNDER ITS PREVIOUS PROTOCOL. THIS AMENDMENT WAS INTENDED TO ACCELERATE OUR TIMELINE TO COMPLETE TRIAL ENROLLMENT WHILE PROVIDING A STRONG SCIENTIFIC CASE TO SUPPORT AN APPLICATION FOR APPROVAL.  HOWEVER, ACCRUAL OF NEW PATIENTS IN THIS TRIAL SLOWED DUE TO THE CASH LIMITATIONS WE OPERATED UNDER IN RECENT MONTHS. WITH THE NEW CAPITAL INVESTMENT WE ANNOUNCED ON JULY 11, 2019 WE BELIEVE WE CAN COMPLETE PATIENT ENROLLMENT IN THIS TRIAL DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2019.  THE AMENDMENT INVALIDATED THE PRIOR SPECIAL PROTOCOL ASSESSMENT (\u201cSPA\u201d) AGREEMENT FOR THE PRIOR VERSION OF THE TRIAL. FULL DETAILS OF THE REGISTRATION PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL ARE AVAILABLE AT WWW.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV.  THE FOCUS TRIAL IS BEING CONDUCTED AT LEADING CANCER CENTERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE. THE MOFFITT CANCER CENTER IN TAMPA, FLORIDA WAS ACTIVATED AS A PARTICIPATING CENTER IN JANUARY 2016 WITH JONATHAN ZAGER, M.D., FACS, PROFESSOR OF SURGERY IN THE CUTANEOUS ONCOLOGY AND SARCOMA DEPARTMENTS AND A SENIOR MEMBER AT MOFFITT CANCER CENTER, SERVING AS THE TRIAL'S LEAD INVESTIGATOR. IN OCTOBER 2018, WE ANNOUNCED CONT  INUED ROLLOUT OF THE AMENDED PROTOCOL TO PARTICIPATING CENTERS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND EXPECT APPROXIMATELY 30 LEADING CANCER CENTERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TRIAL.  WE BELIEVE THAT OCULAR MELANOMA LIVER METASTASES REPRESENT  A SIGNIFICANT UNMET MEDICAL NEED, AND THAT PURSUIT OF AN INDICATION IN THIS DISEASE STATE REPRESENTS THE FASTEST PATH TO POTENTIAL MARKETING APPROVAL OF THE MELPHALAN/HDS IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE ALIGN TRIAL -  NCT03086993  20  IN APRIL 2018 WE ANNOUNCED THE IN  ITIATION OF A NEW PIVOTAL TRIAL OF MELPHALAN/HDS TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH ICC TITLED  A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED STUDY TO COMPARE THE EFFICACY, SAFETY AND PHARMACOKINETICS OF MELPHALAN/HDS TREATMENT GIVEN SEQUENTIALLY FOLLOWING CISPLATIN/GEMCITABINE VERSUS CISP  LATIN/GEMCITABINE (STANDARD OF CARE) IN PATIENTS WITH INTRAHEPATIC CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA (THE ALIGN TRIAL)  .   THE ALIGN TRIAL IS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER A SPA ANNOUNCED IN MARCH OF 2017.  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SPA, THE ALIGN TRIAL WILL ENROLL APPROXIMATELY 295  ICC PATIENTS AT APPROXIMATELY 40 CLINICAL SITES IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE.  THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT IS OVERALL SURVIVAL (  \u201c  OS  \u201d  ) AND SECONDARY AND EXPLORATORY ENDPOINTS INCLUDE SAFETY, PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL (  \u201c  PFS  \u201d  ), ORR AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE MEASURES. THE ALIGN  TRIAL IS DESIGNED TO BE COST EFFECTIVE AND PURSUED IN A FINANCIALLY PRUDENT MANNER WHEN FINANCIAL RESOURCES PERMIT. THE SPA AGREEMENT FOR THE ALIGN TRIAL INDICATES THAT THE PIVOTAL TRIAL DESIGN ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES OBJECTIVES THAT, IF MET, WOULD SUPPORT R  EGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR APPROVAL OF MELPHALAN/HDS IN ICC.  HOWEVER, FINAL DETERMINATIONS FOR MARKETING APPLICATION APPROVAL ARE MADE BY FDA AFTER A COMPLETE REVIEW OF A MARKETING APPLICATION AND ARE BASED ON THE TOTALITY OF DATA IN THE APPLICATION.  IN OCTOBER 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THE ENROLLMENT OF THE FIRST PATIENT IN THE ALIGN TRIAL  AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCIENCE CENTER, METHODIST UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, AND WEST CANCER CENTER  IN MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE.  PHASE 2 HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA (HCC) & IN  TRAHEPATIC CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA (ICC) PROGRAM  IN 2014 WE INITIATED A PHASE 2 CLINICAL TRIAL PROGRAM IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES, WITH THE GOAL OF OBTAINING AN EFFICACY AND SAFETY SIGNAL FOR MELPHALAN/HDS IN THE TREATMENT OF HCC AND ICC. DUE TO DIFFERENCE  S IN TREATMENT PRACTICE PATTERNS BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES, WE ESTABLISHED SEPARATE EUROPEAN AND UNITED STATES TRIAL PROTOCOLS FOR THE HCC PHASE 2 PROGRAM WITH DIFFERENT INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION PATIENT SELECTION CRITERIA.  PROTOCOL 201  NCT02406508  \u2013 CONDUCTED IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS TRIAL WAS INTENDED TO ASSESS THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF MELPHALAN/HDS FOLLOWED BY SORAFENIB.  THIS TRIAL WAS TERMINATED EARLIER THAN PLANNED AND IS NOW CLOSED TO ENROLLMENT.  PROTOCOL 202 NCT02415036  \u2013 CONDUCTED IN EUROPE, THIS TRIAL WAS INTENDED TO ASSESS THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF MELPHALAN/HDS WITHOUT SORAFENIB. THE TRIAL WILL ALSO EVALUATE OVERALL RESPONSE RATE VIA MRECIST CRITERIA, PROGRESSION FREE SURVIVAL, CHARACTERIZE THE SYSTEMIC EXPOSURE OF MELPHALAN AND ASSESS PATIENT QUALITY OF LIFE.  THIS TRIAL WAS TERMINATED EARLIER THAN PLANNED AND IS NOW CLOSED TO ENROLLMENT.  ICC COHORT  \u2013 IN 2015 WE EXPANDED  PROTOCOL 202  TO INCLUDE A COHORT OF PATIENTS WITH ICC. THE TRIAL FOR THIS COHORT WAS CONDUCTED AT THE SAME CENTERS PARTICIPATING IN THE PHASE 2 HCC TRIAL.  THIS TRIAL HAS COMPLETED ENROLLMENT AND DATA FROM THIS STUDY ARE BEING ANALYZED AND WILL BE DISSEMINATED PUBLICLY BY THE INVESTIGATORS.  ICC RETROSPECTIVE DATA COLLECTION  - THE ORIGINAL GOAL TO OBTAIN AN EFFICACY SIGNAL FOR THE PHASE 2 ICC COHORT HAS BEEN SATISFIED BY THE RESULT OF MULTICENTER PATIENT OUTCOMES IDENTIFIED IN THE RETROSPECTIVE DATA COLLECTION OF OUR COMMERCIAL ICC CASES CONDUCTED BY OUR EUROPEAN INVESTIGATORS. THESE PROMISING OUTCOMES AND OBSERVATIONS WERE DISCUSSED WITH KEY OPINION LEADERS AT A DELCATH-ORGANIZED MEDICAL ADVISORY PANEL MEETING AND LED TO THE AGREEMENT THAT PHP THERAPY DOES \u201cDEMONSTRATE AN EFFICACY SIGNAL IN ICC AND IS WORTHY OF FULL CLINICAL INVESTIGATION.\u201d DATA FROM THIS RETROSPECTIVE DATA COLLECTION PROVIDED IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT DURING OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE FDA FOR OUR SPA FOR THE PIVOTAL ICC TRIAL. DATA FOR THE RETROSPECTIVE DATA COLLECTION WERE PUBLISHED IN EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY IN A PAPER TITLED \u201cPERCUTANEOUS HEPATIC PERFUSION (CHEMOSATURATION) WITH MELPHALAN IN PATIENTS WITH INTRAHEPATIC CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA: EUROPEAN MULTICENTRE STUDY ON SAFETY, SHORT TERM EFFECTS AND SURVIVAL\u201d.  DETAILS OF THE FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY ARE DISCUSSED BELOW UNDER \u201cRECENT DATA PRESENTATIONS\u201d.  WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF IDENTIFYING AN EFFICACY SIGNAL WORTHY OF FURTHER CLINICAL  INVESTIGATION NOW MET, WE HAVE TERMINATED ENROLLMENT IN OUR PHASE 2 PROGRAM AND HAVE CLOSED THE PHASE 2 TRIALS IN ORDER TO FOCUS AVAILABLE RESOURCES ON THE FOCUS TRIAL AND THE ALIGN TRIAL.  CLINICAL TRIALS ARE LONG, EXPENSIVE AND HIGHLY UNCERTAIN PROCESSES AND FAILURE CAN UNEXPECTEDLY OCCUR AT ANY STAGE OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. THE START OR END OF A CLINICAL TRIAL IS OFTEN DELAYED OR HALTED DUE TO CHANGING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, MANUFACTURING CHALLENGES, REQUIRED CLINICAL TRIAL ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS, SLOWER THAN ANTICIPATED PATIENT ENROLLMENT, CHANGING STANDARDS OF CARE, AVAILABILITY OR PREVALENCE OF USE OF A COMPARATOR TREATMENT OR REQUIRED PRIOR THERAPY. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING EXPENSES CONSIST OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH ITS CLINICAL TRIALS. SEE THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  EUROPEAN INVESTIGATOR INITIATED TRIALS  IN ADDITION TO THE CLINICAL TRIALS IN OUR CDP, WE ARE SUPPORTING DATA GENERATION IN OTHER AREAS. WE ARE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING ONE IIT IN COLORECTAL CARCINOMA METASTATIC TO THE LIVER (\u201cMCRC\u201d) AT LEIDEN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER IN THE NETHERLANDS.   WE CONTINUE TO  21  EVALUA  TE OTHER IITS AS SUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES PRESENT IN EUROPE. WE BELIEVE IITS WILL SERVE TO BUILD CLINICAL EXPERIENCE AT KEY CANCER CENTERS AND WILL HELP SUPPORT EFFORTS TO OBTAIN FULL REIMBURSEMENT IN EUROPE.  EUROPEAN CLINICAL DATA GENERATION  ON APRIL 2, 2015, WE ANNOUNCED THE ACTIVATION OF OUR PROSPECTIVE PATIENT REGISTRY IN EUROPE TO COLLECT UNIFORM ESSENTIAL PATIENT SAFETY, EFFICACY, AND QOL INFORMATION USING OBSERVATIONAL STUDY METHODS. THIS REGISTRY WILL GATHER DATA IN MULTIPLE TUMOR TYPES FROM COMMERCIAL CASES PERFORMED BY PARTICIPATING CANCER CENTERS IN EUROPE.  A PROSPECTIVE REGISTRY IS AN ORGANIZED SYSTEM THAT USES OBSERVATIONAL STUDY METHODS TO COLLECT DEFINED CLINICAL DATA UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS OF USE TO EVALUATE SPECIFIED OUTCOMES FOR A POPULATION DEFINED BY A PARTICULAR DISEASE, CONDITION, OR EXPOSURE.  REGISTRY DATA IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUPPORTIVE DATA AND, AS SUCH, CANNOT BE USED FOR EITHER REGISTRATION APPROVAL, PROMOTIONAL OR COMPETITIVE CLAIMS.  HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THE PATIENT REGISTRY WILL PROVIDE A VALUABLE SUPPORTIVE DATA REPOSITORY THAT CONTAINS REAL-WORLD EVIDENCE, FROM A COMMERCIAL SETTING, THAT CAN BE USED TO IDENTIFY FURTHER CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES, SUPPORT CLINICAL ADOPTION AND REIMBURSEMENT IN EUROPE.  RECE  NT DATA PRESENTATIONS  IN APRIL 2019 WE ANNOUNCED THAT RESULTS FROM A PROSPECTIVE PHASE 2 STUDY CONDUCTED BY LEIDEN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER (\u201cLUMC\u201d) IN THE NETHERLANDS ON THE USE OF CHEMOSAT TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC OCULAR MELANOMA WITH LIVER METASTASES WERE PRESENTED AT THE EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON INTERVENTIONAL ONCOLOGY ANNUAL MEETING.  THE LUMC STUDY TITLED \u201cPERCUTANEOUS HEPATIC PERFUSION WITH MELPHALAN IN PATIENTS WITH UNRESECTABLE LIVER METASTASES FROM OCULAR MELANOMA USING THE DELCATH SYSTEM'S SECOND-GENERATION HEMOFILTRATION SYSTEM: A PROSPECTIVE PHASE II STUDY\u201d WAS CONDUCTED BY A TEAM LED AND PRESENTED BY DR. MARK BURGMANS. THE STUDY EVALUATED 35 PATIENTS WITH UNRESECTABLE LIVER METASTASES FROM OCULAR MELANOMA TREATED WITH CHEMOSAT BETWEEN FEBRUARY 2014 AND JUNE 2017. THE 35 PATIENTS UNDERWENT A TOTAL OF 72 PHP THERAPY TREATMENTS, AND TUMOR RESPONSE WAS EVALUABLE IN 32 PATIENTS. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS WERE OVERALL RESPONSE, OVERALL SURVIVAL, AND PROGRESSION FREE SURVIVAL. SECONDARY MEASURES INCLUDED SAFETY MEASURES AND HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITY.  RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOWED THAT ONE PATIENT HAD A COMPLETE RESPONSE AND 22 HAD PARTIAL RESPONSE, FOR A COMBINED OVERALL RESPONSE RATE OF 74.1%. OVERALL SURVIVAL WAS 20.3 MONTHS AND MEAN PROGRESSION FREE SURVIVAL WAS 8.1 MONTHS.  SAFETY ANALYSIS SHOWED A TOTAL OF 14 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE RECORDED. THE HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITIES WERE IN A MAJORITY OF THE CASES SELF-LIMITING AND MANAGEABLE. INVESTIGATORS CONCLUDED THAT \u201cPHP THERAPY WITH THE GENERATION TWO VERSION OF CHEMOSAT IS AN EFFECTIVE AND SAFE TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH HEPATIC METASTASES FROM OCULAR MELANOMA.\u201d  THE PRESENTATION AT THE EUROPEAN CONFERENCE, AN INTERVENTIONAL ONCOLOGY UPDATED DATA PREVIOUSLY PRESENTED AT THE 2018 ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR AND INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF EUROPE.  MARKET ACCESS AND COMMERCIAL CLINICAL ADOPTION  EUROPE  DELCATH\u2019S EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARY, DELCATH SYSTEMS, LTD., IS HEADQUARTERED IN GALWAY, IRELAND.  OUR MARKETING STRATEGY IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA (THE \u201cEEA\u201d) INCLUDES ESTABLISHING STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH PARTNERS THAT INCLUDE LICENSE, SUPPLY, SALES AND MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS.  IN DECEMBER 2018, DELCATH ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE LICENSING AGREEMENT (THE \u201cMEDAC LICENSE\u201d) FOR CHEMOSAT COMMERCIALIZATION IN EUROPE WITH MEDAC GESELLSCHAFT FU\u0308R KLINISCHE SPEZIALPRA\u0308PARATE MBH (\u201cMEDAC\u201d), A PRIVATELY HELD, MULTI-NATIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY BASED IN WEDEL, GERMANY. FOUNDED IN 1970, MEDAC SPECIALIZES IN THE TREATMENT AND DIAGNOSIS OF ONCOLOGICAL, UROLOGICAL AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. MEDAC HAS OFFICES GLOBALLY, WORLDWIDE PARTNER AGREEMENTS IN OVER 90 COUNTRIES, AND APPROXIMATELY 1,200 EMPLOYEES.  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MEDAC LICENSE, DELCATH SYSTEMS, LTD. EXCLUSIVELY LICENSES TO MEDAC THE RIGHT TO SELL AND MARKET CHEMOSAT IN ALL MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, NORWAY, LIECHTENSTEIN, SWITZERLAND, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE MEDAC LICENSE PROVIDES FOR PAYMENT BY MEDAC TO DELCATH IN A COMBINATION OF UPFRONT AND SUCCESS-BASED MILESTONE PAYMENTS AS WELL AS A FIXED TRANSFER PRICE PER UNIT OF CHEMOSAT AND SPECIFIED ROYALTIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT MEDAC IS A WELL-SUITED PARTNER TO HELP ADVANCE CHEMOSAT COMMERCIALIZATION IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. MEDAC HAS OFFICES THROUGHOUT EUROPE, A WELL-ESTABLISHED NETWORK AMONG ONCOLOGY K  EY OPINION LEADERS, AND ORGANIZATIONAL SCALE NECESSARY TO HELP ESTABLISH CHEMOSAT IN THE EUROPEAN TREATMENT LANDSCAPE FOR CANCERS OF THE LIVER.  22  SINCE LAUNCHING CHEMOSAT IN EUROPE,  OVER  700  COMMERCIAL TREATMENTS HAVE BEE  N PERFORMED AT OVER 25 LEADING EUROPEAN CANCER CENTERS. PHYSICIANS IN EUROPE HAVE USED CHEMOSAT TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH A VARIETY OF CANCERS IN THE LIVER, PRIMARILY OCULAR MELANOMA LIVER METASTASES, AND OTHER TUMOR TYPES, INCLUDING CUTANEOUS MELANOMA, HEPAT  OCELLULAR CARCINOMA, CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA, AND LIVER METASTASES FROM COLORECTAL CANCER, BREAST, PANCREATIC AND NEUROENDOCRINE.  IN 2017, WE ANNOUNCED OUR FIRST PATIENT TO RECEIVE EIGHT CHEMOSAT TREATMENTS, AND HAVE SEEN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF REPEAT TREATMENT  S PERFORMED ON A PER PATIENT BASIS CONSISTENTLY INCREASE.  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WE  CONTINUED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH MEDAC ON ADVANCEMENT OF THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF CHEMOSAT IN EUROPE. MEDAC HAS REMAINED SUPPORTIVE DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR AND IS CONFIDENT IN THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHEMOSAT IN EUROPE.  EUROPEAN REIMBURSEMENT  A CRITICAL DRIVER OF UTILIZATION GROWTH FOR CHEMOSAT IN EUROPE IS THE EXPANSION OF REIMBURSEMENT MECHANISMS FOR THE PROCEDURE IN OUR PRIORITY MARKETS. IN EUROPE, THERE IS NO CENTRALIZED PAN-EUROPEAN MEDICAL DEVICE REIMBURSEMENT BODY. REIMBURSEMENT IS ADMINISTERED ON A REGIONAL AND NATIONAL BASIS. MEDICAL DEVICES ARE TYPICALLY REIMBURSED UNDER DIAGNOSIS RELATED GROUPS (\u201cDRG\u201d) AS PART OF A PROCEDURE.  PRIOR TO OBTAINING PERMANENT DRG REIMBURSEMENT CODES, IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, WE ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING INTERIM REIMBURSEMENT FROM EXISTING MECHANISMS THAT INCLUDE SPECIFIC INTERIM REIMBURSEMENT SCHEMES, NEW TECHNOLOGY PAYMENT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS EXISTING DRG CODES. IN MOST EU COUNTRIES, THE GOVERNMENT PROVIDES HEALTHCARE AND CONTROLS REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS. SINCE THE EU HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER PATIENT REIMBURSEMENT OR PRICING MATTERS IN ITS MEMBER STATES, THE METHODOLOGI  ES FOR DETERMINING REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND THE ACTUAL RATES MAY VARY BY COUNTRY.  EFFECTIVE WITH THE EXECUTION OF OUR LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH MEDAC, MEDAC WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR REIMBURSEMENT APPLICATIONS IN THE EUROPEAN MARKETS COVERED BY OUR AGREEMENT.  GERMANY  IN OCTOBER 2015, WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE INSTITUT F\u03a5\u0308R DAS ENTGELTSYSTEM IM KRANKENHAUS (INEK), THE GERMAN FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT AGENCY, ESTABLISHED A NATIONAL ZUSATZENTGELD (ZE) REIMBURSEMENT CODE FOR PROCEDURES PERFORMED WITH CHEMOSAT IN GERMANY. THE ZE DIAGNOSTIC-RELATED GROUP (DRG) CODE IS A NATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT CODE THAT AUGMENTS EXISTING DRG CODES UNTIL A SPECIFIC NEW DRG CODE CAN BE CREATED AND WILL REPLACE THE PREVIOUS NEUE UNTERSUCHUNGS UND BEHANDLUNGSMETHODEN (NUB) PROCEDURE THAT REQUIRED PATIENTS IN GERMANY TO APPLY INDIVIDUALLY FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF THEIR CHEMOSAT TREATMENT.  WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A ZE CODE FOR CHEMOSAT, THE PROCEDURE IS NOW PERMANENTLY REPRESENTED IN THE DRG CATALOG IN GERMANY. COVERAGE LEVELS UNDER THIS PROCESS ARE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN HOSPITALS IN GERMANY AND REGIONAL SICKNESS FUNDS, WITH COVERAGE LEVELS RENEGOTIATED ANNUALLY.  UNITED KINGDOM  IN MAY 2014, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR CLINICAL EXCELLENCE (\u201cNICE\u201d), A NON-DEPARTMENTAL PUBLIC BODY THAT PROVIDES GUIDANCE AND ADVICE TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE IN THE UK, COMPLETED A CLINICAL REVIEW OF CHEMOSAT. THE NICE REVIEW INDICATED THAT AS THE CURRENT BODY OF EVIDENCE ON THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF PHP WITH CHEMOSAT FOR PRIMARY OR METASTATIC LIVER CANCER IS LIMITED, THE PROCEDURE SHOULD BE PERFORMED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF RESEARCH BY CLINICIANS WITH SPECIFIC TRAINING IN ITS USE AND TECHNIQUES.  DELCATH EXPECTS TO CONSULT AGAIN WITH THE INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURES ADVISORY COMMITTEE AT NICE IN ENGLAND, TO PROVIDE RECENT  CLINICAL EVIDENCE WITH A VIEW TO MOVING EXISTING INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURAL GUIDANCE FROM RESEARCH TO SPECIALIST STATUS.  MEDAC WILL CONTINUE CONSULTATIONS BEGUN BY DELCATH WITH THE INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURES ADVISORY COMMITTEE AT NICE IN ENGLAND, PROVIDING RECENT CLINICAL EVIDENCE WITH A VIEW TO MOVING EXISTING INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURAL GUIDANCE FROM A RESEARCH RECOMMENDATION TO SPECIALIST RECOMMENDATION. THIS WOULD ENABLE GREATER SCOPE FOR COMMERCIALIZATION ACCESS TO THE THERAPY BECAUSE IT WOULD ALLOW MORE USE BY NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE (\u201cNHS\u201d) CLINICIANS OF THE THERAPY. IT MIGHT ALSO PAVE THE WAY FOR A FULL MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT AS A WAY TOWARDS LONGER TERM REIMBURSEMENT WITHIN THE NHS.  IN THE SHORT TERM, PUBLIC PATIENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE TREATED IN THE UK THROUGH CLINICAL TRIALS. PRIVATE PATIENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE TREATED THROUGH THE ESTABLISHED PRIVATE TREATMENT PATHWAY SUCH AS PRIVATE INSURANCE COVERAGE OR SELF-PAY.  NETHERLANDS  IN THE NETHERLANDS CHEMOSAT HAS BEEN PERFORMED AT THE NETHERLANDS CANCER INSTITUTE IN 2013 AND AT LEIDEN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTRE SINCE 2014. IN JUNE 2017 THE MEDICAL ONCOLOGY NATIONAL TREATMENT GUIDELINES FOR UVEAL MELANOMA WERE UPDATED AND NOW INCLUDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONSIDER CHEMOSAT IN THE TREATMENT OF LIVER METASTASES. WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL GUIDELINES AND THE SUPPORT OF CLINICIANS TREATING PATIENTS WITH CHEMOSAT WILL SUPPORT AN APPLICATION FOR REIMBURSEMENT IN THIS MARKET.  23  REGULATORY STATUS  OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND RIGOROUS GOVERNMENT REGULATION BY FOREIGN REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE FDA. FOREIGN REGULATORY AGENCIES, THE FDA AND COMPARABLE REGULATORY AGENCIES IN STATE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IMPOSE EXTENSIVE REQUIREMENTS UPON THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, PRE-MARKET CLEARANCE AND APPROVAL, MANUFACTURING, LABELING, MARKETING, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION, PRICING, STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION OF PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL DEVICE PRODUCTS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE FOREIGN REGULATORY AGENCY OR FDA REQUIREMENTS MAY RESULT IN WARNING LETTERS, FINES, CIVIL OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES, SUSPENSION OR DELAYS IN CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, RECALL OR SEIZURE OF PRODUCTS, PARTIAL OR TOTAL SUSPENSION OF PRODUCTION OR WITHDRAWAL OF A PRODUCT FROM THE MARKET.  UNITED STATES REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT  IN THE UNITED STATES, THE FDA REGULATES DRUG AND DEVICE PRODUCTS UNDER THE FFDCA, AND ITS IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS. THE DELCATH MELPHALAN/HDS IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION AS A COMBINATION PRODUCT, WHICH MEANS IT IS COMPOSED OF BOTH A DRUG PRODUCT AND DEVICE PRODUCT. IF MARKETED INDIVIDUALLY, EACH COMPONENT WOULD THEREFORE BE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT REGULATORY PATHWAYS AND REVIEWED BY DIFFERENT CENTERS WITHIN THE FDA. A COMBINATION PRODUCT, HOWEVER, IS ASSIGNED TO A CENTER THAT WILL HAVE PRIMARY JURISDICTION OVER ITS PRE-MARKET REVIEW AND REGULATION BASED ON A DETERMINATION OF ITS PRIMARY MODE OF ACTION, WHICH IS THE SINGLE MODE OF ACTION THAT PROVIDES THE MOST IMPORTANT THERAPEUTIC ACTION. IN THE CASE OF THE MELPHALAN/HDS, THE PRIMARY MODE OF ACTION IS ATTRIBUTABL  E TO THE DRUG COMPONENT OF THE PRODUCT, WHICH MEANS THAT THE CENTER FOR DRUG EVALUATION AND RESEARCH, HAS PRIMARY JURISDICTION OVER ITS PRE-MARKET DEVELOPMENT AND REVIEW.  THE PROCESS REQUIRED BY THE FDA BEFORE DRUG PRODUCT CANDIDATES MAY BE MARKETED IN THE UNITED STATES GENERALLY INVOLVES THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  SUBMISSION TO THE FDA OF AN IND, WHICH MUST BECOME EFFECTIVE BEFORE HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS MAY BEGIN AND MUST BE UPDATED PERIODICALLY, BUT AT LEAST ANNUALLY;  \u2022  COMPLETION OF EXTENSIVE PRECLINICAL LABORATORY TESTS AND PRECLINICAL ANIMAL STUDIES, ALL PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FDA\u2019S GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICE, OR GLP, REGULATIONS;  \u2022  PERFORMANCE OF ADEQUATE AND WELL-CONTROLLED HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS TO ESTABLISH THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE PRODUCT CANDIDATE FOR EACH PROPOSED INDICATION;  \u2022  SUBMISSION TO THE FDA OF AN NDA AFTER COMPLETION OF ALL PIVOTAL CLINICAL TRIALS;  \u2022  A DETERMINATION BY THE FDA WITHIN 60 DAYS OF ITS RECEIPT OF AN NDA TO FILE THE NDA FOR REVIEW;  \u2022  SATISFACTORY COMPLETION OF AN FDA PRE-APPROVAL INSPECTION OF THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AT WHICH THE PRODUCT IS PRODUCED AND TESTED TO ASSESS COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE, OR CGMP, REGULATIONS; AND  \u2022  FDA REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF AN NDA PRIOR TO ANY COMMERCIAL MARKETING OR SALE OF THE DRUG IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL PROCESS REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL TIME, EFFORT AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES, AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT ANY APPROVALS FOR OUR PRODUCT WILL BE GRANTED ON A TIMELY B  ASIS, IF AT ALL.  THE RESULTS OF PRECLINICAL TESTS (WHICH INCLUDE LABORATORY EVALUATION AS WELL AS GLP STUDIES TO EVALUATE TOXICITY IN ANIMALS) FOR A PARTICULAR PRODUCT CANDIDATE, TOGETHER WITH RELATED MANUFACTURING INFORMATION AND ANALYTICAL DATA, ARE SUBMITTED AS PART OF AN IND TO THE FDA. THE IND AUTOMATICALLY BECOMES EFFECTIVE 30 DAYS AFTER RECEIPT BY THE FDA, UNLESS THE FDA, WITHIN THE 30-DAY TIME PERIOD, RAISES CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CONDUCT OF THE PROPOSED CLINICAL TRIAL, INCLUDING CONCERNS THAT HUMAN RESEARCH SUBJECTS WILL BE EXPOSED TO UNREASONABLE HEALTH RISKS. IN SUCH A CASE, THE IND SPONSOR AND THE FDA MUST RESOLVE ANY OUTSTANDING CONCERNS BEFORE THE CLINICAL TRIAL CAN BEGIN. IND SUBMISSIONS MAY NOT RESULT IN FDA AUTHORIZATION TO COMMENCE A CLINICAL TRIAL. A SEPARATE SUBMISSION TO AN EXISTING IND MUST ALSO BE MADE FOR EACH SUCCESSIVE CLINICAL TRIAL CONDUCTED DURING PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. FURTHER, AN INDEPENDENT INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD, OR IRB, FOR EACH MEDICAL CENTER PROPOSING TO CONDUCT THE CLINICAL TRIAL MUST REVIEW AND APPROVE THE PLAN FOR ANY CLINICAL TRIAL BEFORE IT COMMENCES AT THAT CENTER AND IT MUST MONITOR THE STUDY UNTIL COMPLETED. THE FDA, THE IRB OR THE SPONSOR  24  MAY SUSPEND A CLINICAL TRIAL AT ANY TIME ON VARIOUS GROUNDS, INCLUD  ING A FINDING THAT THE SUBJECTS OR PATIENTS ARE BEING EXPOSED TO AN UNACCEPTABLE HEALTH RISK. CLINICAL TESTING ALSO MUST SATISFY EXTENSIVE GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE REGULATIONS AND REGULATIONS FOR INFORMED CONSENT AND PRIVACY OF INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFO  RMATION. SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES IND ARE REQUIRED IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE MAY CONDUCT CLINICAL TRIALS.  CLINICAL TRIALS  FOR PURPOSES OF NDA SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL, CLINICAL TRIALS ARE TYPICALLY CONDUCTED IN THE FOLLOWING SEQUENTIAL PHASES, WHICH MAY OVERLAP.  \u2022  PHASE 1 CLINICAL TRIALS. STUDIES ARE INITIALLY CONDUCTED IN A LIMITED POPULATION TO TEST THE PRODUCT CANDIDATE FOR SAFETY, DOSE TOLERANCE, ABSORPTION, DISTRIBUTION, METABOLISM AND EXCRETION, TYPICALLY IN HEALTHY HUMANS, BUT IN SOME CASES IN PATIENTS.  \u2022  PHASE 2 CLINICAL TRIALS. STUDIES ARE GENERALLY CONDUCTED IN A LIMITED PATIENT POPULATION TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS AND SAFETY RISKS, EXPLORE THE INITIAL EFFICACY OF THE PRODUCT FOR SPECIFIC TARGETED INDICATIONS AND TO DETERMINE DOSE RANGE OR PHARMACODYNAMICS. MULTIPLE PHASE 2 CLINICAL TRIALS MAY BE CONDUCTED BY THE SPONSOR TO OBTAIN INFORMATION PRIOR TO BEGINNING LARGER AND MORE EXPENSIVE PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIALS.  \u2022  PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIALS. THESE ARE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS PIVOTAL STUDIES. WHEN PHASE 2 EVALUATIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT A DOSE RANGE OF THE PRODUCT IS EFFECTIVE AND HAS AN ACCEPTABLE SAFETY PROFILE, PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIALS ARE UNDERTAKEN IN LARGE PATIENT POPULATIONS TO FURTHER EVALUATE DOSAGE, PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF CLINICAL EFFICACY AND FURTHER TEST FOR SAFETY IN AN EXPANDED AND DIVERSE PATIENT POPULATION AT MULTIPLE, GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED CLINICAL TRIAL CENTERS.  \u2022  PHASE 4 CLINICAL TRIALS. THE FDA MAY APPROVE AN NDA FOR A PRODUCT CANDIDATE, BUT REQUIRE THAT THE SPONSOR CONDUCT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS TO FURTHER ASSESS THE DRUG AFTER NDA APPROVAL UNDER A POST-APPROVAL COMMITMENT. IN ADDITION, A SPONSOR MAY DECIDE TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS AFTER THE FDA HAS APPROVED AN NDA. POST-APPROVAL TRIALS ARE TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS PHASE 4 CLINICAL TRIALS.  SPONSORS OF CLINICAL TRIALS MAY SUBMIT PROPOSALS FOR THE DESIGN, EXECUTION, AND ANALYSIS FOR THEIR PIVOTAL TRIALS UNDER A SPA. A SPA IS AN EVALUATION BY THE FDA OF A PROTOCOL WITH THE GOAL OF REACHING AN AGREEMENT THAT THE PHASE 3 TRIAL PROTOCOL DESIGN, CLINICAL ENDPOINTS, AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES ARE ACCEPTABLE TO SUPPORT REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE DRUG PRODUCT CANDIDATE WITH RESPECT TO EFFECTIVENESS FOR THE INDICATION STUDIED. UNDER A SPA, THE FDA AGREES TO NOT LATER ALTER ITS POSITION WITH RESPECT TO ADEQUACY OF THE DESIGN, EXECUTION OR ANALYSES OF THE CLINICAL TRIAL INTENDED TO FORM THE PRIMARY BASIS OF AN EFFECTIVENESS CLAIM IN AN NDA, WITHOUT THE SPONSOR\u2019S AGREEMENT, UNLESS THE FDA IDENTIFIES A SUBSTANTIAL SCIENTIFIC ISSUE ESSENTIAL TO DETERMINING THE SAFETY OR EFFICACY OF THE DRUG AFTER TESTING BEGINS.  PRIOR TO INITIATING OUR CURRENTLY ONGOING PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL(S), WE SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL FOR THE DESIGN, EXECUTION AND ANALYSIS UNDER A SPA.  NEW DRUG APPLICATIONS  THE RESULTS OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT, PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS ARE SUBMITTED TO THE FDA AS PART OF AN NDA. NDAS ALSO MUST CONTAIN EXTENSIVE CHEMISTRY, MANUFACTURING AND CONTROL INFORMATION. AN NDA MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A SIGNIFICANT USER FEE, WHICH MAY BE WAIVED IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. ONCE THE SUBMISSION HAS BEEN ACCEPTED FOR FILING, THE FDA\u2019S GOAL IS TO REVIEW APPLICATIONS WITHIN TEN MONTHS OF SUBMISSION OR, IF THE APPLICATION RELATES TO AN UNMET MEDICAL NEED IN A SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING INDICATION, SIX MONTHS FROM SUBMISSION. THE REVIEW PROCESS IS OFTEN SIGNIFICANTLY EXTENDED BY FDA REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR CLARIFICATION. THE FDA MAY REFER THE APPLICATION TO AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR REVIEW, EVALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION AS TO WHETHER THE APPLICATION SHOULD BE APPROVED. FOR NEW ONCOLOGY PRODUCTS, THE FDA WILL OFTEN SOLICIT AN OPINION FROM AN ODAC, A PANEL OF EXPERT AUTHORITIES KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THE FIELDS OF GENERAL ONCOLOGY, PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY, HEMATOLOGIC ONCOLOGY, IMMUNOLOGIC ONCOLOGY, BIOSTATISTICS, AND OTHER RELATED PROFESSIONS. THE ODAC PANEL REVIEWS AND EVALUATES DATA CONCERNING THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETED AND INVESTIGATIONAL HUMAN DRUG PRODUCTS FOR USE IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER, AND MAKES APPROPRIATE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COMMISSIONER OF FOOD AND DRUGS. THE FDA IS NOT BOUND BY THE RECOMMENDATION OF AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE. THE FDA MAY DENY  25  APPROVAL OF AN NDA BY ISSUING A COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER (CRL) IF THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY CRITERIA ARE NOT SATISFIED.  A CRL MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CLINICAL DATA AND/OR AN ADDITIONAL PIVOTAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL(S), AND/OR OTHER SIGNIFICANT, EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO CLINICAL TRIALS, PRECLINICAL STUDIES OR MANUFACTURING. DATA FROM CLINICAL TRIA  LS ARE NOT ALWAYS CONCLUSIVE AND THE FDA MAY INTERPRET DATA DIFFERENTLY THAN WE OR OUR COLLABORATORS INTERPRET DATA. APPROVAL MAY BE CONTINGENT ON A RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS) THAT LIMITS THE LABELING, DISTRIBUTION OR PROMOTION OF A DRU  G PRODUCT. ONCE ISSUED, THE FDA MAY WITHDRAW PRODUCT APPROVAL IF ONGOING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT MET OR IF SAFETY PROBLEMS OCCUR AFTER THE PRODUCT REACHES THE MARKET. IN ADDITION, THE FDA MAY REQUIRE TESTING, INCLUDING PHASE IV CLINICAL TRIALS, AND  SURVEILLANCE PROGRAMS TO MONITOR THE SAFETY EFFECTS OF APPROVED PRODUCTS WHICH HAVE BEEN COMMERCIALIZED, AND THE FDA HAS THE POWER TO PREVENT OR LIMIT FURTHER MARKETING OF A PRODUCT BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THESE POST-MARKETING PROGRAMS OR OTHER INFORMATIO  N.  THERE ARE THREE PRIMARY REGULATORY PATHWAYS FOR A NEW DRUG APPLICATION UNDER SECTION 505 OF THE FFDCA: SECTION 505 (B)(1), SECTION 505 (B)(2) AND SECTION 505(J).  A SECTION 505 (B)(1) APPLICATION IS USED FOR APPROVAL OF A NEW DRUG (FOR CLINICAL USE) WHOSE ACTIVE INGREDIENTS HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY APPROVED. A SECTION 505 (B)(2) APPLICATION IS USED FOR A NEW DRUG THAT RELIES ON DATA NOT DEVELOPED BY THE APPLICANT. SECTION 505(B)(2) OF THE FFDCA WAS ENACTED AS PART OF THE DRUG PRICE COMPETITION AND PATENT TERM RESTORATION ACT OF 1984, ALSO KNOWN AS THE HATCH-WAXMAN ACT. THIS STATUTORY PROVISION PERMITS THE APPROVAL OF AN NDA WHERE AT LEAST SOME OF THE INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR APPROVAL COMES FROM STUDIES NOT CONDUCTED BY OR FOR THE APPLICANT AND FOR WHICH THE APPLICANT HAS NOT OBTAINED A RIGHT OF REFERENCE. THE HATCH-WAXMAN ACT PERMITS THE APPLICANT TO RELY IN PART UPON THE FDA\u2019S FINDINGS OF SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS FOR PREVIOUSLY APPROVED PRODUCTS. SECTION 505(J) APPLICATION, ALSO KNOWN AS AN ABBREVIATED NDA, IS USED FOR A GENERIC VERSION OF A DRUG THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN APPROVED.  ORPHAN DRUG EXCLUSIVITY  SOME JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES, MAY DESIGNATE DRUGS FOR RELATIVELY SMALL PATIENT POPULATIONS AS ORPHAN DRUGS. PURSUANT TO THE ORPHAN DRUG ACT, THE FDA GRANTS ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION TO DRUGS INTENDED TO TREAT A RARE DISEASE OR CONDITION, WHICH IS GENERALLY A DISEASE OR CONDITION THAT AFFECTS FEWER THAN 200,000 INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES. THE ORPHAN DESIGNATION IS GRANTED FOR A COMBINATION OF A DRUG ENTITY AND AN INDICATION AND THEREFORE IT CAN BE GRANTED FOR AN EXISTING DRUG WITH A NEW (ORPHAN) INDICATION. APPLICATIONS ARE MADE TO THE OFFICE OF ORPHAN PRODUCTS DEVELOPMENT AT THE FDA AND A DECISION OR REQUEST FOR MORE INFORMATION IS RENDERED IN 60 DAYS. NDAS FOR DESIGNATED ORPHAN DRUGS ARE EXEMPT FROM USER FEES, OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CLINICAL PROTOCOL ASSISTANCE, ARE ELIGIBLE FOR TAX CREDITS UP TO 50% OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, AND ARE GRANTED A SEVEN-YEAR PERIOD OF EXCLUSIVITY UPON APPROVAL. THE FDA CANNOT APPROVE THE SAME DRUG FOR THE SAME CONDITION DURING THIS PERIOD OF EXCLUSIVITY, EXCEPT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A NEW PRODUCT DEMONSTRATES SUPERIORITY TO THE ORIGINAL TREATMENT. EXCLUSIVITY BEGINS ON THE DATE THAT THE MARKET  ING APPLICATION IS APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR THE DESIGNATED ORPHAN DRUG, AND AN ORPHAN DESIGNATION DOES NOT LIMIT THE USE OF THAT DRUG IN OTHER APPLICATIONS OUTSIDE THE APPROVED DESIGNATION IN EITHER A COMMERCIAL OR INVESTIGATIONAL SETTING.  THE FDA HAS GRANTED DELCATH SIX ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATIONS. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FDA GRANTED DELCATH TWO ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATIONS FOR THE DRUG MELPHALAN FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH CUTANEOUS MELANOMA, AS WELL AS PATIENTS WITH OCULAR MELANOMA. IN MAY 2009, THE FDA GRANTED DELCATH AN ADDITIONAL ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION OF THE DRUG MELPHALAN FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS. IN AUGUST 2009, THE FDA GRANTED DELCATH AN ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION OF THE DRUG DOXORUBICIN FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY LIVER CANCER. IN OCTOBER 2013, THE FDA GRANTED DELCATH AN ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION OF THE DRUG MELPHALAN FOR THE TREATMENT OF HCC. IN JULY 2015, THE FDA GRANTED DELCATH AN ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION OF THE DRUG MELPHALAN FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHOLANGIO  CARCINOMA, WHICH INCLUDES ICC.  THE GRANTING OF ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATIONS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE FDA HAS APPROVED A NEW DRUG. COMPANIES MUST STILL PURSUE THE RIGOROUS DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL PROCESS THAT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL TIME, EFFORT AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES, AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT ANY APPROVALS FOR OUR PRODUCT WILL BE GRANTED AT ALL, OR ON A TIMELY BASIS.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER RIGHTS  OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS, MAINTAIN TRADE SECRET AND KNOW-HOW PROTECTION, ENFORCE OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS AGAINST INFRINGERS, AND OPERATE WITHOUT INFRINGING ON THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES. BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND BRINGING THEM THROUGH THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS, THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY PLACES CONSIDERABLE EMPHASIS ON OBTAINING PATENT PROTECTION AND MAINTAINING TRADE SECRET PROTECTION FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCTS, PROCESSES, KNOW-HOW, AND METHODS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HOLDS RIGHTS IN EIGHT U.S. UTILITY PATENTS, ONE U.S. DESIGN PATENT, FIVE PENDING U.S. UTILITY PATENT APPLICATIONS, SIX ISSUED FOREIGN COUNTERPART UTILITY PATENTS (INCLUDING THE VALIDATION OF A EUROPEAN PATENT DIRECTED TO OUR FILTER APPARATUS IN EIGHT EUROPEAN COUNTRI  ES, SIX ISSUED FOREIGN COUNTERPART DESIGN PATENTS, AND EIGHT PENDING FOREIGN COUNTERPART PATENT APPLICATIONS. IN JULY 2017, A PATENT DIRECTED TO OUR CHEMOTHERAPY FILTRATION SYSTEM WAS ISSUED BY THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE.  IN OCTOBER 2018 AND FEBRUARY 2019 PATENTS DIRECTED TO OUR CHEMOTHERAPY FILTRATION SYSTEM AND A METHOD OF USING OUR FILTER AND FRAME APPARATUS WERE ISSUED BY THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE. A NOTICE OF  26  ALLOWANCE WAS OBTAINED FROM THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEM  ARK OFFICE FOR THE PATENT APPLICATION ENTITLED \u201cAPPARATUS FOR REMOVING CHEMOTHERAPY COMPOUNDS FROM BLOOD\u201d WITH ALLOWED CLAIMS TO A KIT OF PARTS CAPABLE OF BEING ASSEMBLED FOR DELIVERING A SMALL MOLECULE CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT TO A SUBJECT. THE ALLOWED CLAI  MS ARE DIRECTED TO CHEMOSAT. A HONG KONG PATENT DIRECTED TO OUR FILTER AND FRAME APPARATUS WAS ISSUED IN MARCH OF 2018. A EUROPEAN PATENT WAS GRANTED FOR OUR CHEMOTHERAPY FILTRATION SYSTEM IN NOVEMBER 2018 AND A EUROPEAN PATENT APPLICATION DIRECTED TO A ME  THOD OF USING OUR FILTER AND FRAME APPARATUS WAS GRANTED IN APRIL 2019 BY THE EUROPEAN PATENT OFFICE.  WHEN APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANY ACTIVELY PURSUES PROTECTION OF OUR PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES, PROCESSES, AND METHODS BY FILING UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONAL PATENT AND TRADEMARK APPLICATIONS. WE SEEK TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL PATENT PROTECTION FOR TECHNOLOGY INVENTED THROUGH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, AND CLINICAL USE OF THE CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS THAT WILL ENABLE US TO EXPAND OUR PATENT PORTFOLIO AROUND ADVANCES TO OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGY, AND METHODS FOR OUR CURRENT APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS BEYOND THE TREATMENT OF CANCERS IN THE LIVER.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS WILL RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF PATENTS, THAT PATENTS ISSUED TO OR LICENSED BY US WILL NOT BE CHALLENGED OR CIRCUMVENTED BY COMPETITORS, OR THAT THESE PATENTS WILL BE FOUND TO BE VALID OR SUFFICIENTLY BROAD TO PROTECT OUR TECHNOLOGY OR PROVIDE US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.  TO MAINTAIN OUR PROPRIETARY POSITION, WE ALSO RELY ON TRADE SECRETS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE TO PROTECT PROPRIETARY MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, TECHNOLOGY, AND KNOW-HOW RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS.  WE RELY, IN PART, ON CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS WITH OUR MARKETING PARTNERS, EMPLOYEES, ADVISORS, VENDORS AND CONSULTANTS TO PROTECT OUR TRADE SECRETS AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGICAL EXPERTISE. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO SEEK TO MAINTAIN OUR TRADE SECRETS THROUGH MAINTENANCE OF THE PHYSICAL SECURITY OF THE PREMISES WHERE OUR TRADE SECRETS ARE LOCATED.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE AGREEMENTS WILL NOT BE BREACHED, THAT WE WILL HAVE ADEQUATE REMEDIES FOR ANY BREACH, THAT OTHERS WILL NOT INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOP EQUIVALENT PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OR THAT THIRD PARTIES WILL NOT OTHERWISE GAIN ACCESS TO OUR TRADE SECRETS AND PROPRIETARY KNOWLEDGE.  IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, UNITED STATES PATENT LAW ALLOWS FOR THE EXTENSION OF A PATENT\u2019S DURATION FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO FIVE YEARS AFTER FDA APPROVAL.  THE COMPANY INTENDS TO SEEK EXTENSION FOR ONE OF OUR PATENTS AFTER FDA APPROVAL IF IT HAS NOT EXPIRED PRIOR TO THE DATE OF APPROVAL. IN ADDITION TO OUR PROPRIETARY PROTECTIONS, THE FDA HAS GRANTED DELCATH FIVE ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATIONS THAT PROVIDE US A SEVEN-YEAR PERIOD OF EXCLUSIVE MARKETING BEGINNING ON THE DATE THAT OUR NDA IS APPROVED BY THE FDA FOR THE DESIGNATED ORPHAN DRUG. WHILE THE EXCLUSIVITY ONLY APPLIES TO THE INDICATION FOR WHICH THE DRUG HAS BEEN APPROVED, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WILL PROVIDE US WITH ADDED PROTECTION ONCE COMMERCIALIZATION OF AN ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATED PRODUCT BEGINS.  THERE HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE SUBSTANTIAL LITIGATION REGARDING PATENT AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL DEVICE AREAS. IF A THIRD PARTY ASSERTS A CLAIM AGAINST DELCATH, THE COMPANY MAY BE FORCED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT TIME AND MONEY DEFENDING SUCH ACTIONS AND AN ADVERSE DETERMINATION IN ANY PATENT LITIGATION COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES TO THIRD PARTIES, REQUIRE US TO REDESIGN OUR PRODUCT, REQUIRE US TO SEEK LICENSES FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND, IF LICENSES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, PREVENT US FROM MANUFACTURING, SELLING OR USING OUR SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY, DELCATH PLANS TO ENFORCE ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS VIGOROUSLY AND MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO INITIATE LITIGATION TO ENFORCE OUR PATENT RIGHTS OR TO PROTECT OUR TRADE SECRETS OR KNOW-HOW. PATENT LITIGATION CAN BE COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE FAVORABLE TO US.  PATENT NO.

ADVERSE EVENT EXPERIENCE WITH THE PRODUCT MUST BE REPORTED TO THE FDA IN A TIMELY FASHION AND PHARMACOVIGILANCE PROGRAMS TO PROACTIVELY LOOK FOR THESE ADVERSE EVENTS ARE MANDATED BY THE  28  FDA. DRUG MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER THEIR ESTABLISHMENTS WITH THE FDA AND CERTAIN STATE AGENC  IES, AND ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC UNANNOUNCED INSPECTIONS BY THE FDA AND CERTAIN STATE AGENCIES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH ONGOING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING CGMPS, WHICH IMPOSE CERTAIN PROCEDURAL AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS UPON US AND OUR THIRD-PARTY  MANUFACTURERS. FOLLOWING SUCH INSPECTIONS, THE FDA MAY ISSUE NOTICES ON FORM 483 AND UNTITLED LETTERS OR WARNING LETTERS THAT COULD CAUSE US OR OUR THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS TO MODIFY CERTAIN ACTIVITIES. A FORM 483 NOTICE, IF ISSUED AT THE CONCLUSION OF AN  FDA INSPECTION, CAN LIST CONDITIONS THE FDA INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE MAY HAVE VIOLATED CGMP OR OTHER FDA REGULATIONS OR GUIDELINES. IN ADDITION TO FORM 483 NOTICES AND UNTITLED LETTERS OR WARNING LETTERS, FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE STATUTORY AND REGULATORY R  EQUIREMENTS CAN SUBJECT A MANUFACTURER TO POSSIBLE LEGAL OR REGULATORY ACTION, SUCH AS SUSPENSION OF MANUFACTURING, SEIZURE OF PRODUCT, INJUNCTIVE ACTION OR POSSIBLE CIVIL PENALTIES. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT WE OR OUR PRESENT OR FUTURE THIRD-PARTY MANUFAC  TURERS OR SUPPLIERS WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE CGMP REGULATIONS AND OTHER ONGOING FDA REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. IF WE OR OUR PRESENT OR FUTURE THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS OR SUPPLIERS ARE NOT ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS, THE FDA MAY REQUIRE US  TO RECALL OUR PRODUCTS FROM DISTRIBUTION OR WITHDRAW ANY POTENTIAL APPROVALS OF AN NDA FOR THAT PRODUCT.  THE FDA CLOSELY REGULATES THE POST-APPROVAL MARKETING AND PROMOTION OF DRUGS, INCLUDING STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS FOR DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISING, DISSEMINATION OF OFF-LABEL INFORMATION, INDUSTRY-SPONSORED SCIENTIFIC AND EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES INVOLVING THE INTERNET. DRUGS MAY BE MARKETED ONLY FOR THE APPROVED INDICATIONS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE APPROVED LABEL. FURTHER, IF THERE ARE ANY MODIFICATIONS TO THE DRUG, INCLUDING CHANGES IN INDICATIONS, LABELING, OR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES OR FACILITIES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT AND OBTAIN FDA APPROVAL OF A NEW OR SUPPLEMENTAL NDA, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL DATA OR CONDUCT ADDITIONAL PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS CAN RESULT IN ADVERSE PUBLICITY, WARNING LETTERS, CORRECTIVE ADVERTISING AND POTENTIAL CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  PHYSICIANS MAY PRESCRIBE LEGALLY AVAILABLE PRODUCTS FOR USES THAT ARE NOT DESCRIBED IN THE PRODUCT\u2019S LABELING AND THAT DIFFER FROM THOSE TESTED BY US AND APPROVED BY THE FDA. SUCH OFF-LABEL USES ARE COMMON ACROSS MEDICAL SPECIALTIES, IN PARTICULAR IN ONCOLOGY. PHYSICIANS MAY BELIEVE THAT SUCH OFF-LABEL USES ARE THE BEST TREATMENT FOR MANY PATIENTS IN VARIED CIRCUMSTANCES. THE FDA DOES NOT REGULATE THE BEHAVIOR OF PHYSICIANS IN THEIR CHOICE OF TREATMENTS. THE FDA DOES, HOWEVER, IMPOSE STRINGENT RESTRICTIONS ON MANUFACTURERS\u2019 COMMUNICATIONS REGARDING OFF-LABEL USE.  EUROPEAN REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT  IN THE EEA, THE CHEMOSAT SYSTEM IS SUBJECT TO REGULATION AS A MEDICAL DEVICE. THE EEA IS COMPOSED OF THE 27 MEMBER STATES OF THE EU PLUS NORWAY, ICELAND AND LIECHTENSTEIN. UNDER THE EU MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE (DIRECTIVE NO 93/42/ECC OF 14 JUNE 1993, AS LAST AMENDED), DRUG DELIVERY PRODUCTS SUCH AS THE CHEMOSAT SYSTEM IS GOVERNED BY THE EU LAWS ON PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS ONLY IF THEY ARE (I) PLACED ON THE MARKET IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE DEVICE AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT FORM A SINGLE INTEGRAL UNIT WHICH IS INTENDED EXCLUSIVELY FOR USE IN THE GIVEN COMBINATION, AND (II) THE PRODUCT IS NOT REUSABLE. IN SUCH CASES, THE DRUG DELIVERY PRODUCT IS GOVERNED BY THE EU CODE ON MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE (DIRECTIVE 2001/83/EC, AS LAST AMENDED), WHILE THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE EU MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE APPLY TO THE SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE-RELATED DEVICE FEATURES OF THE PRODUCT. BECAUSE WE DO NOT INTEND TO PLACE THE CHEMOSAT SYSTEM ON THE EEA MARKET AS A SINGLE INTEGRAL UNIT WITH MELPHALAN, THE PRODUCT IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY THE EU MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE, WHILE THE SEPARATELY MARKETED DRUG IS GOVERNED BY THE EU CODE RELATING TO MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE AND OTHER  EU LEGISLATION APPLICABLE TO DRUGS FOR HUMAN USE.  BEFORE WE MAY COMMERCIALIZE A MEDICAL DEVICE IN THE EEA, WE MUST COMPLY WITH THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE EU MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS ENTITLES A MANUFACTURER TO AFFIX A CE CONFORMITY MARK, WITHOUT WHICH THE PRODUCTS CANNOT BE COMMERCIALIZED IN THE EEA. TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE WITH THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS AND OBTAIN THE RIGHT TO AFFIX THE CE CONFORMITY MARK, MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURERS MUST UNDERGO A CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE, WHICH VARIES ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF MEDICAL DEVICE AND ITS CLASSIFICATION. IN APRIL 2011, WE OBTAINED AUTHORIZATION TO AFFIX A CE MARK FOR THE GENERATION ONE CHEMOSAT SYSTEM AND BEGAN EUROPEAN COMMERCIALIZATION WITH THIS VERSION OF  THE CHEMOSAT SYSTEM IN EARLY 2012. IN APRIL 2012, THE COMPANY OBTAINED AUTHORIZATION TO AFFIX A CE MARK FOR THE GENERATION TWO CHEMOSAT SYSTEM, AND SINCE THIS TIME ALL PROCEDURES IN EUROPE HAVE BEEN PERFORMED WITH THIS VERSION OF THE SYSTEM.  THE MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE ESTABLISHES A CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM PLACING DEVICES INTO CLASS I, IIA, IIB, OR III, DEPENDING ON THE RISKS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE. FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF LOW RISK MEDICAL DEVICES (I.E., CLASS I DEVICES WHICH ARE NON-STERILE AND DO NOT HAVE A MEASURING FUNCTION), THE MANUFACTURER MAY ISSUE AN EC DECLARATION OF CONFORMITY BASED ON A SELF-ASSESSMENT OF THE CONFORMITY OF ITS PRODUCTS WITH THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE EU MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVES. OTHER DEVICES ARE SUBJECT  TO A CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE REQUIRING THE INTERVENTION OF A NOTIFIED BODY, WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION DESIGNATED BY A MEMBER STATE OF THE EEA TO CONDUCT CONFORMITY ASSESSMENTS.  CHEMOSAT IS REGULATED AS A CLASS IIB MEDICAL DEVICE. AS A CLASS IIB MEDICAL DEVICE, THE NOTIFIED BODY IS NOT REQUIRED TO CARRY OUT AN EXAMINATION OF THE PRODUCT\u2019S DESIGN DOSSIER AS PART OF ITS CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT PRIOR TO COMMERCIALIZATION. THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE EU MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE (DIRECTIVE 93/42 EC) AND IS SUBJECT TO A  29  CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE REQUIRING THE INTERVENTION OF A NOTIFIED BODY.  THE CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE FOR CLAS  S IIB MEDICAL DEVICES REQUIRES THE MANUFACTURER TO APPLY FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF ITS QUALITY SYSTEM FOR THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND INSPECTION OF ITS MEDICAL DEVICES BY A NOTIFIED BODY.  THE NOTIFIED BODY WILL AUDIT THE SYSTEM TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT CONFORM  S TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE.  IF THE NOTIFIED BODY\u2019S ASSESSMENT IS FAVORABLE, IT WILL ISSUE A FULL QUALITY ASSURANCE CERTIFICATE, WHICH ENABLES THE MANUFACTURER TO DRAW A DECLARATION OF CONFORMITY AND AFFIX THE CE MARK TO THE MEDIC  AL DEVICES COVERED BY THE ASSESSMENT. THEREAFTER, THE NOTIFIED BODY WILL CARRY OUT PERIODIC AUDITS TO ENSURE THAT THE APPROVED QUALITY SYSTEM IS APPLIED BY THE MANUFACTURER.  A MANUFACTURER WITHOUT A REGISTERED PLACE OF BUSINESS IN A MEMBER STATE OF THE EU WHICH PLACES A MEDICAL DEVICE ON THE MARKET UNDER ITS OWN NAME MUST DESIGNATE AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE ESTABLISHED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION WHO CAN ACT BEFORE, AND BE ADDRESSED BY, THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES ON THE MANUFACTURER\u2019S BEHALF WITH REGARD TO THE MANUFACTURER\u2019S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE EU MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE. WE APPOINTED SUCH A REPRESENTATIVE PRIOR TO ESTABLISHING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE EEA.  WITH THE DELCATH SYSTEMS LTD. INFRASTRUCTURE NOW FIRMLY IN PLACE, THE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE BEEN FORMALLY TRANSFERRED INTERNALLY AND THERE IS NO LONGER A NEED FOR A THIRD-PARTY REPRESENTATIVE.  IN THE EEA, WE MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH THE MEDICAL DEVICE VIGILANCE SYSTEM, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE PROTECTION OF HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PATIENTS, USERS AND OTHERS BY REDUCING THE LIKELIHOOD OF RECURRENCE OF INCIDENTS RELATED TO THE USE OF A MEDICAL DEVICE. UNDER THIS SYSTEM, INCIDENTS ARE DEFINED AS ANY MALFUNCTION OR DETERIORATION IN THE CHARACTERISTICS AND/OR PERFORMANCE OF A DEVICE, AS WELL AS ANY INADEQUACY IN THE LABELING OR THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE WHICH, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, MIGHT LEAD TO OR MIGHT HAVE LED TO THE DEATH OF A PATIENT, OR USER OR OF OTHER PERSONS OR TO A SERIOUS DETERIORATION IN THEIR STATE OF HEALTH. WHEN A MEDICAL DEVICE IS SUSPECTED TO BE A CONTRIBUTORY CAUSE OF AN INCIDENT, ITS MANUFACTURER OR AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE IN THE EU MUST REPORT IT TO THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY OF THE MEMBER STATE WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. INCIDENTS ARE GENERALLY INVESTIGATED BY THE MANUFACTURER. THE MANUFACTURER\u2019S INVESTIGATION IS MONITORED BY THE COMPETENT AUTHORITY, WHICH MAY INTERVENE, OR INITIATE AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION  IF CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE. AN INVESTIGATION MAY CONCLUDE IN THE ADOPTION OF A FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION (FSCA). AN FSCA IS AN ACTION TAKEN BY A MANUFACTURER TO REDUCE A RISK OF DEATH OR SERIOUS DETERIORATION IN THE STATE OF HEALTH ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF A MEDICAL DEVICE THAT IS ALREADY PLACED ON THE MARKET. AN FSCA MAY INCLUDE DEVICE RECALL, MODI  FICATION EXCHANGE AND DESTRUCTION. FSCAS MUST BE NOTIFIED BY THE MANUFACTURER OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE TO ITS CUSTOMERS AND/OR THE END USERS OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE VIA A FIELD SAFETY NOTICE.  IN THE EEA, THE OFF-LABEL PROMOTION OF A PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED UNDER THE EU COMMUNITY CODE ON MEDICINAL PRODUCTS, WHICH PROVIDES THAT ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE PROMOTION OF A DRUG MUST COMPLY WITH THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN ITS APPROVED SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS. OUR PRODUCT INSTRUCTIONS AND INDICATION REFERENCE THE CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT MELPHALAN HYDROCHLORIDE. HOWEVER, NO MELPHALAN LABELS IN THE EEA REFERENCE OUR PRODUCT, AND THE LABELS VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROVED INDICATION OF THE DRUG AND ITS MODE OF ADMINISTRATION. IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, PHYSICIANS ARE GENERALLY ALLOWED, UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, TO USE OR PRESCRIBE A PRODUCT IN WAYS NOT APPROVED BY REGULATORY AUTHORIT  IES. PHYSICIANS INTENDING TO USE OUR DEVICE MUST OBTAIN MELPHALAN SEPARATELY FOR USE WITH THE CHEMOSAT SYSTEM AND MUST USE MELPHALAN INDEPENDENTLY AT THEIR DISCRETION.  IN THE EEA, THE ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION OF OUR PRODUCTS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO EEA MEMBER STATES LAWS IMPLEMENTING THE EU MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE, DIRECTIVE 2006/114/EC CONCERNING MISLEADING AND COMPARATIVE ADVERTISING AND DIRECTIVE 2005/29/EC ON UNFAIR COMMERCIAL PRACTICES, AS WELL AS OTHER EEA MEMBER STATE LEGISLATION GOVERNING THE ADVERTIS  ING AND PROMOTION OF MEDICAL DEVICES. THESE LAWS MAY FURTHER LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION OF OUR PRODUCTS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND MAY ALSO IMPOSE LIMITATIONS ON OUR PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES WITH HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS.  FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE EEA MEMBER STATE LAWS IMPLEMENTING THE MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE, WITH THE EU AND EEA MEMBER STATE LAWS ON THE PROMOTION OF MEDICINAL PRODUCTS OR WITH OTHER APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS CAN RESULT IN ENFORCEMENT ACTION BY THE EEA MEMBER S  TATE AUTHORITIES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING: FINES, IMPRISONMENT, ORDERS FORFEITING PRODUCTS OR PROHIBITING OR SUSPENDING THEIR SUPPLY TO THE MARKET, OR REQUIRING THE MANUFACTURER TO ISSUE PUBLIC WARNINGS, OR TO CONDUCT A PRODUCT RECALL.  THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION RECENTLY REVIEWED THE MEDICAL DEVICE DIRECTIVE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK AND PROMULGATED  REGULATION (EU) 2017/745 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL OF 5 APRIL 2017 ON MEDICAL DEVICES, AMENDING DIRECTIVE 2001/83/EC, REGULATION EC)  NO 178/2002 AND REGULATION (EC) NO 1223/2009 AND REPEALING COUNCIL DIRECTIVES 90/385/EEC AND 93/42/EEC.  THIS NEW MEDICAL DEVICE REGULATION BECAME EFFECTIVE ON MAY 25, 2017, MARKING THE START OF A 3-YEAR TRANSITION PERIOD FOR MANUFACTURERS SELLING MEDICAL DEVICE IN EUROPE TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW MEDICAL DEVICE REGULATION (\u201cMDR\u201d) WHICH GOVERNS ALL FACETS OF MEDICAL DEVICES.  THE TRANSITION TASK IS HIGHLY COMPLEX AND TOUCHES EVERY ASPECT OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION AND POST MARKETING EVALUATION.  30  EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSING THESE CHANGES WILL REQUIRE A COMPLETE REVIEW OF OUR DEVICE OPERATIONS TO DETERMINE WHAT IS NECESSARY TO COMPLY.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE MDR REGULATORY CHANGES WILL IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AT THIS TIME, THOUGH IMPLE  MENTATION OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE LEGISLATION MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS.  OTHER INTERNATIONAL REGULATIONS  WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES IN SELECT MARKETS WHEN RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE AND AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME.  COMPETITION  THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY EXTENSIVE RESEARCH, RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS AND SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM NUMEROUS HEALTHCARE COMPANIES AND ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS. COMPETITION IN THE CANCER TREATMENT INDUSTRY IS INTENSE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRIMARY COMPETITIVE FACTORS FOR PRODUCTS ADDRESSING CANCER INCLUDE SAFETY, EFFICACY, EASE OF USE, RELIABILITY AND PRICE. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT PHYSICIAN RELATIONSHIPS, ESPECIALLY RELATIONSHIPS WITH LEADERS IN THE MEDICAL AND SURGICAL ONCOLOGY COMMUNITIES, ARE IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE FACTORS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND NEW HEALTHCARE REFORMS COULD PUT COMPETITIVE PRESSURE ON US, INCLUDING REDUCED SELLIN  G PRICES AND POTENTIAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES, AND OVERALL PROCEDURE RATES. CERTAIN MARKETS IN EUROPE ARE EXPERIENCING THE EFFECTS OF CONTINUED ECONOMIC WEAKNESS, WHICH IS AFFECTING HEALTHCARE BUDGETS AND REIMBURSEMENT.  CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS COMPETES WITH ALL FORMS OF LIVER CANCER TREATMENTS, INCLUDING SURGERY, SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY, FOCAL THERAPIES AND PALLIATIVE CARE. IN THE DISEASE STATES WE ARE TARGETING THERE ARE ALSO NUMEROUS CLINICAL TRIALS SPONSORED BY THIRD-PARTIES, WHICH CAN COMPETE FOR POTENTIAL PATIENTS IN THE NEAR TERM AND MAY ULTIMATELY LEAD TO NEW COMPETITIVE THERAPIES.  FOR OCULAR MELANOMA LIVER METASTASES, THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO APPROVED OR EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS, AND PATIENTS ARE GENERALLY TREATED WITH A VARIETY OF FOCAL AND  REGIONAL TECHNIQUES. THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPANIES DEVELOPING AND MARKETING DEVICES FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF FOCAL THERAPIES, INCLUDING COVIDIAN, BIOCOMPATIBLES, MERIT, CELENOVA, SIRTEX, ANGIODYNAMICS, AND MANY OTHERS.  FOR ICC, GEMCITABINE PLUS CISPLATIN REMA  INS THE STANDARD OF CARE FOR THE TREATMENT OF ICC IN PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT CANDIDATES FOR SURGERY.  SEVERAL THERAPIES HAVE BEEN RECENTLY APPROVED FOR UNRESECTABLE OR METASTATIC CUTANEOUS MELANOMA, WHICH MAY ENCOMPASS LIVER METASTASES.  DABRAFENIB (TAFINLARTM, GLAXOSMITHKLINE), IS INDICATED AS SINGLE AGENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH UNRESECTABLE OR METASTATIC MELANOMA WITH BRAF V600E MUTATION, AND IN COMBINATION WITH TRAMETINIB IN UNRESECTABLE OR METASTATIC MELANOMA WITH BRAF V600E OR V600K MUTATIONS.  FURTHERMORE, TRAMETINIB (MEKINISTTM, GLAXOSMITHKLINE) IS INDICATED AS SINGLE AGENT (IN ADDITION TO IN COMBINATION WITH DABRAFINIB) FOR TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH UNRESECTABLE OR METASTATIC MELANOMA WITH BRAF V600E OR V600K MUTATIONS. PREVIOUSLY APPROVED MEL  ANOMA THERAPIES SUCH AS THE BIOLOGIC IPILIMUMAB (YERVOYTM, BRISTOL MYERS SQUIBB) AND THE B-RAF TARGETED DRUG VEMURAFENIB (ZELBORAFTM, GENENTECH) MAY ALSO MAKE UP THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE FOR THE TREATMENT OF METASTATIC LIVER DISEASE.  MANY OF THESE TREATMENT  S ARE APPROVED IN EUROPE AND OTHER GLOBAL MARKETS.  MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER FINANCIAL, TECHNOLOGICAL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND PERSONNEL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE IN CONDUCTING CLINICAL TRIALS, REGULATORY, MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION CAPABILITIES. OUR COMPETITORS MAY DEVELOP ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT METHODS, OR ACHIEVE EARLIER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, IN WHICH CASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF US ACHIEVING MEANINGFUL REVENUES  OR PROFITABILITY WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED.  MANUFACTURING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  WE MANUFACTURE CERTAIN CRITICAL MEDICAL DEVICE COMPONENTS INCLUDING OUR PROPRIETARY FILTER MEDIA AND ASSEMBLE AND PACKAGE THE CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS AT OUR FACILITY IN QUEENSBURY, NEW YORK. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED OUR EUROPEAN HEADQUARTERS AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITY IN GALWAY, IRELAND WHERE WE CONDUCT FINAL MANUFACTURING, PROCESSING AND ASSEMBLY. DELCATH CURRENTLY UTILIZES THIRD-PARTIES TO MANUFACTURE SOME COMPONENTS OF THE CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS. THE CHEMOSAT AND MELPHALAN/HDS AND ITS COMPONENTS MUST BE MANUFACTURED AND STERILIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPROVED MANUFACTURING AND PRE-DETERMINED PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COMPONENTS WILL REQUIRE STERILI  ZATION PRIOR TO DISTRIBUTION AND DELCATH RELIES ON THIRD-PARTY VENDORS TO PERFORM THE STERILIZATION PROCESS.  WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. TO HONOR THIS COMMITMENT, DELCATH HAS IMPLEMENTED UPDATED QUALITY SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT OUR ORGANIZATION. DELCATH\u2019S QUALITY SYSTEM STARTS WITH THE INITIAL PRODUCT SPECIFICATION AND CONTINUES  31  THROUGH THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT, COMPONENT SPECIFICATION PROCESS AND THE MANUFACTURING, SALE AND SERVICING OF THE PRODUCT. THESE SYSTEMS ARE DE  SIGNED TO ENABLE US TO SATISFY THE VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL QUALITY SYSTEM REGULATIONS INCLUDING THOSE OF THE FDA WITH RESPECT TO PRODUCTS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES AND THOSE ESTABLISHED BY THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ORGANIZATION (ISO) WITH RESPECT TO PRODUC  TS SOLD IN THE EEA. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ISO 13485 CERTIFICATION FOR MEDICAL DEVICES TO BE SOLD IN THE EEA, WHICH REQUIRES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, AN IMPLEMENTED QUALITY SYSTEM THAT APPLIES TO COMPONENT QUALITY, SUPPLIER CONTROL, PRODUCT DESIGN  AND MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. ON FEBRUARY 17, 2011, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ACHIEVED ISO 13485 CERTIFICATION FOR OUR QUEENSBURY MANUFACTURING FACILITY. ON DECEMBER 28, 2011, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ACHIEVED ISO 13485 CERTIFICATION FOR OUR GALWAY, IRELAND  FACILITY.  ALL DELCATH MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ARE PRESENTLY ISO 13485:2016 CERTIFIED.  RECENT EVENTS  ON JULY 11, 2019, THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN ACCREDITED INVESTORS (EACH AN \u201cINVESTOR\u201d AND, COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cINVESTORS\u201d) ENTERED INTO A SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cSECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO SELL AND ISSUE TO THE INVESTORS AN AGGREGATE OF 20,000  SHARES OF SERIES E CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.01 PER SHARE,  AT A PRICE OF $1,000 PER SHARE (THE \u201cPRIVATE PLACEMENT\u201d).  PURSUANT TO THE SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY WILL ISSUE TO EACH INVESTOR A WARRANT (A \u201cWARRANT\u201d) TO PURCHASE A NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY, PAR VALUE $0.01 PER SHARE (\u201cCOMMON STOCK\u201d), EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION OF THE SERIES E PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASED BY THE INVESTOR.  EACH WARRANT WILL HAVE AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO $0.06, SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE WARRANTS (THE \u201cEXERCISE PRICE\u201d), AND BE EXERCISABLE AT ANY TIME BEGINNING ON THE DATE THAT THE COMPANY EFFECTS A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT UNTIL 5:00 P.M. (NYC TIME) ON THE DATE THAT IS FIVE YEARS FOLLOWING THE DATE THAT THE COMPANY EFFECTS A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE GROSS PROCEEDS FROM THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY  $20.0  MILLION  , BEFORE DEDUCTING CASH FEES IN THE AMOUNT OF $1.4 MILLION PAYABLE TO ROTH CAPITAL PARTNERS, LLC (\u201cROTH\u201d) FOR SERVING AS PLACEMENT AGENT FOR THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT AND CASH FEES IN THE AMOUNT OF $552,000 PAYABLE TO ROTH FOR SERVING AS PLACEMENT AGENT FOR CERTAIN PRIOR SECURITIES OFFERINGS BY THE COMPANY, AND OTHER TRANSACTION COSTS, FEES AND EXPENSES PAYABLE BY THE COMPANY.  32  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  ; COMPARISONS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  REVENUE  THE COMPANY RECORDED APPROXIMATELY $0.1 MILLION IN REVENUE RELATED TO PRODUCT SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND $0.7 MILLION IN REVENUE RELATED TO PRODUCT SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE DECREASE WAS SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY $0.2 MILLION IN OTHER REVENUE. OTHER REVENUE AND THE DECREASE IN PRODUCT REVENUE ARE BOTH RELATED TO THE COMPANY ENTERING INTO A LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH MEDAC AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN THE MARKET ACCESS AND COMMERCIAL CLINICAL ADOPTION SECTION ABOVE.  COST OF GOODS SOLD  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY RECORDED COST OF GOODS SOLD OF APPROXIMATELY $0.1 MILLION COMPARED TO $0.15 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $50,000 IS RELATED TO  AN ADJUSTMENT IN THE ALLOCATION OF EXPENSES INTO COGS DURING  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $2.5 MILLION AND $2.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO NON-CASH PERSONNEL RELATED ACCRUALS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES DECREASED TO $3.3 MILLION FROM $5.7 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE A REDUCED RATE OF ENROLLMENT AND RELATED PROFESSIONAL SERVICES RELATED TO THE ONGOING ACCRUAL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PHASE 3 FOCUS TRIAL WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN FURTHER DETAIL IN THE  ACTIVE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  SECTION ABOVE. THE REDUCTION IS RELATED TO THE CASH CONSTRAINTS THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE WARRANT LIABILITY  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE WARRANT LIABILITY WAS APPROXIMATELY $7,000 AS COMPARED TO $14.7 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE INCREASE OF $14.7 MILLION IS DUE TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN WARRANTS FROM LIABILITY TO EQUITY IN 2018 AND THE CONTINUED MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS TO THE REMAINING WARRANT LIABILITY AS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 10 TO THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE  OTHER EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNTS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 8 OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, AS WELL AS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES.  INTEREST INCOME IS FROM A MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT AND INTEREST EARNED ON OPERATING ACCOUNTS.  NET LOSS  THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 OF $7.9 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $15.1 MILLION, OR 209.8%, COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF $7.2 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THIS INCREASE IN NET LOSS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $14.7 MILLION CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE WARRANT LIABILITY, A NON-CASH ITEM, AND A $2.2 MILLION DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY\u2019S CAPITAL RESOURCES AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO FUND PLANNED OPERATIONS DURING 2019. THE COMPANY WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL UNDER STRUCTURES AVAILABLE TO IT INCLUDING DEBT AND/OR EQUITY OFFERINGS THIS YEAR. IF THESE SOURCES DO NOT PROVIDE THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO FUND THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY WILL NEED TO CURTAIL CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ITS OPERATIONS OR CONSIDER OTHER MEANS OF OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FINANCING, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPANY COULD OBTAIN THE FINANCING NECESSARY TO CONTINUE ITS OPERATIONS.  33  THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.  AS NOTED ABOVE,  DELCATH HAS OPERATED AT A LOSS FOR ITS ENTIRE HISTORY AND ANTICIPATES THAT LOSSES WILL CONTINUE OVER THE COMING YEARS.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT DELCATH  WILL EVER GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES OR ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO USE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENT PROCEEDS TO FUND ITS CLINICAL AND OPERATING ACTIVITIES. DELCATH\u2019S FUTURE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON N  UMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE INITIATION AND PROGRESS OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS; OBTAINING APPROVALS AND COMPLYING WITH REGULATIONS; THE TIMING AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PRODUCT COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING MAR  KETING ARRANGEMENTS; THE TIMING AND COSTS INVOLVED IN PREPARING, FILING, PROSECUTING, DEFENDING AND ENFORCING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; AND THE EFFECT OF COMPETING TECHNOLOGICAL AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH TOTALING $1.3 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH TOTALING $3.6 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND $3.1 MILLION AT MARCH 31, 2018. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, THE COMPANY USED $2.8 MILLION AND $6.4 MILLION RESPECTIVELY, OF CASH IN ITS OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 HAVE BEEN PREPARED UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT WE WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN FOR TH  E NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES AND OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. BECAUSE DELCATH\u2019S BUSINESS DOES NOT GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, THE COMPANY WILL NEED TO OBTAIN SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN ORDER TO FUND CLINICAL TRIAL RESEARCH AND SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS RELATING TO OCULAR MELANOMA LIVER METASTASES, ICC, HCC OR OTHER INDICATIONS, AND TO FULLY COMMERCIALIZE THE PRODUCT.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE EVENT IT IS IN ITS BEST INTEREST TO DO SO. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES RAISING SUCH ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BY EITHER BORROWING MONEY, SELLING SHARES OF DELCATH\u2019S CAPITAL STOCK, OR ENTERING INTO STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH APPROPRIATE PARTNERS. TO THE EXTENT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IS NOT AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, THE COMPANY MAY BE FORCED TO ABANDON SOME OR ALL OF ITS DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS, WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PROSPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS. FURTHER, THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO ITS CASH REQUIREMENTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ITS ACTUAL REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT UNFORESEEN DELAYS IN THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS, CHANGES IN THE TIMING, SCOPE, FOCUS AND DIRECTION OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND COSTS RELATED TO COMMERCIALIZING THE PRODUCT.  THE COMPANY HAS FUNDED ITS OPERATIONS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF ITS SECURITIES IN 2000, 2003, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2018 AND 2019, INCLUDING REGISTERED DIRECT OFFERINGS IN 2007, 2009 AND 2013, \u201cAT THE MARKET\u201d EQUITY OFFERING PROGRAMS IN 2012 AND 2013, AND BY THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN 2016 AND 2018, AND, MOST RECENTLY, ON JULY 15, 2019, THE COMPANY RAISED $20.0 MILLION IN THE CLOSING OF A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK AND WARRANTS TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S VARIOUS SALES OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES SEE NOTES 8, 9, AND 14 TO THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AS WELL AS NOTES 10 AND 11 TO THE COMPANY\u2019S AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  IN OCTOBER 2018, THE COMPANY FILED A REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 WITH THE SEC, WHICH WAS DECLARED EFFECTIVE ON DECEMBER 21, 2018 AND ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO OFFER AND SELL, FROM TIME TO TIME IN ONE OR MORE OFFERINGS, UP TO $100.0 MILLION OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK, WARRANTS, DEBT SECURITIES AND STOCK PURCHASE CONTRACTS AS IT DEEMS PRUDENT OR NECESSARY TO RAISE CAPITAL AT A LATER DATE. THE COMPANY HAS LOST ITS FORM S-3 ELIGIBILITY DUE TO THE LATE FILING OF ITS FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THE COMPANY INTENDS TO USE THE NET PROCEEDS FROM ANY FUTURE OFFERINGS FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FUNDING OF CLINICAL TRIALS, OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVALS, COMMERCIALIZATION OF ITS PRODUCTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL.  APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP).  CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, PLEASE REFER TO THE BELOW SECTION OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q TITLED \u201cCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.\u201d UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES, ALL REFERENCES TO \u201cWE\u201d, \u201cUS\u201d, THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d, OR \u201cNEUROMETRIX\u201d IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q REFER TO NEUROMETRIX, INC.  OVERVIEW  NEUROMETRIX IS A COMMERCIAL STAGE, INNOVATION DRIVEN HEALTHCARE COMPANY COMBINING NEUROSTIMULATION AND DIGITAL MEDICINE TO ADDRESS CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS INCLUDING CHRONIC PAIN, SLEEP DISORDERS, AND DIABETES. OUR CORE EXPERTISE IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING HAS BEEN REFINED OVER NEARLY TWO DECADES OF DESIGNING, BUILDING AND MARKETING MEDICAL DEVICES THAT STIMULATE NERVES AND ANALYZE NERVE RESPONSE FOR DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES. WE CREATED THE MARKET FOR POINT-OF-CARE NERVE TESTING AND WERE FIRST TO MARKET WITH SOPHISTICATED WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN. WE HAVE AN EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT TEAM AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OUR BUSINESS IS FULLY INTEGRATED WITH IN-HOUSE CAPABILITIES SPANNING PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, REGULATORY AFFAIRS AND COMPLIANCE, SALES AND MARKETING, AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT. WE DERIVE REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF MEDICAL DEVICES AND AFTER-MARKET CONSUMABLE PRODUCTS AND ACCESSORIES. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES AND SELECT OVERSEAS MARKETS AND ARE CLEARED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) AND REGULATORS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WHERE APPROPRIATE. WE HAVE TWO PRINCIPAL PRODUCT LINES.  \u2022  WEARABLE NEUROSTIMULATION THERAPEUTIC DEVICES  \u2022  POINT-OF-CARE NEUROPATHY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS  CHRONIC PAIN IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. IT IS DEFINED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AS ANY PAIN LASTING MORE THAN 12 WEEKS. THIS CONTRASTS WITH ACUTE PAIN WHICH IS A NORMAL BODILY RESPONSE TO INJURY OR TRAUMA. CHRONIC PAIN MAY BE TRIGGERED BY AN INJURY OR THERE MAY BE AN ONGOING CAUSE SUCH AS DISEASE OR ILLNESS. THERE MAY ALSO BE NO CLEAR CAUSE. IN INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC PAIN, PAIN SIGNALS CONTINUE TO BE TRANSMITTED IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OVER EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME OFTEN LEADING TO OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS. THESE CAN INCLUDE FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, DECREASED APPETITE, AND MOOD CHANGES WHICH CAUSE DIFFICULTY IN CARRYING OUT IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES AND CAN CONTRIBUTE TO DISABILITY AND DESPAIR. IN GENERAL, CHRONIC PAIN CANNOT BE CURED. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN IS FOCUSED ON REDUCING PAIN AND IMPROVING FUNCTION. THE GOAL IS EFFECTIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT.  CHRONIC PAIN AFFECTS OVER 100 MILLION ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MORE THAN 1.5 BILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. THE ESTIMATED INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF CHRONIC PAIN ON HEALTH CARE COSTS IN THE UNITED STATES IS OVER $250 BILLION PER YEAR AND LOST PRODUCTIVITY IS ESTIMATED TO EXCEED $300 BILLION PER YEAR. THE MOST COMMON APPROACH TO CHRONIC PAIN MANAGEMENT IS PAIN MEDICATION. THIS INCLUDES OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ANALGESICS AS WELL AS PRESCRIPTION PAIN MEDICATIONS, BOTH NON-OPIOID AND OPIOID. THE APPROACH TO TREATMENT IS INDIVIDUALIZED, DRUG COMBINATIONS MAY BE EMPLOYED, AND THE RESULTS ARE OFTEN HIT OR MISS. SIDE EFFECTS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDICTION ARE REAL AND THE RISKS ARE SUBSTANTIAL. INCREASINGLY, FEDERAL, STATE AND PRIVATE-PAYER RESTRICTIONS ARE BEING IMPOSED ON PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS AS A RESPONSE TO THOSE RISKS. REFLECTING THE COMPLEXITY OF CHRONIC PAIN AND THE DIFFICULTY IN TREATING IT, WE BELIEVE THAT INADEQUATE RELIEF LEADS 25% TO 50% OF PAIN SUFFERERS TO SEEK ALTERNATIVES TO PRESCRIPTION PAIN MEDICATIONS. THESE ALTERNATIVES INCLUDE NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS, ACUPUNCTURE, CHIROPRACTIC CARE, NON-PRESCRIPTION ANALGESICS, ELECTRICAL STIMULATORS, BRACES, SLEEVES, PADS AND OTHER ITEMS. IN TOTAL THESE PAIN RELIEF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY $20 BILLION IN ANNUAL SPENDING IN THE UNITED STATES.  NERVE STIMULATION IS A WELL-ESTABLISHED CATEGORY OF TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC PAIN. THIS TREATMENT APPROACH IS AVAILABLE THROUGH IMPLANTABLE SPINAL CORD STIMULATION REQUIRING SURGERY WITH ITS ATTENDANT RISKS. NON-INVASIVE APPROACHES INVOLVING TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL NERVE STIMULATION (TENS) HAVE ACHIEVED LIMITED EFFICACY IN PRACTICE DUE TO DEVICE LIMITATIONS, INEFFECTIVE DOSING AND LOW PATIENT ADHERENCE. OUR QUELL WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR CHRONIC PAIN ADDRESSES THESE LIMITATIONS AND HAS RESULTED IN QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS FOR A MAJORITY OF CHRONIC PAIN SUFFERERS WHO HAVE USED THE PRODUCT, WHICH WE HAVE DETERMINED THROUGH POST-MARKET ANALYSIS OF USER DATA SUBMITTED TO US FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES VIA THE QUELL APP, CLINICAL STUDIES, AND USER REVIEWS.  DIABETES IS A WORLDWIDE EPIDEMIC WITH AN ESTIMATED AFFECTED POPULATION OF OVER 400 MILLION PEOPLE. WITHIN THE UNITED STATES THERE ARE OVER 30 MILLION PEOPLE WITH DIABETES AND ANOTHER 80 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-DIABETES. THE ANNUAL DIRECT COST OF  13  TREATING DIABETES IN THE UNITED STATES EXCEEDS $100 BILLION. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE DANGEROUS ACUTE MANIFESTATIONS OF DIABETES, THE PRIMARY BURDEN OF THE DISEASE IS IN ITS LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS WHICH INCLUDE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, NERVE DISEASE AND RESULTING CONDITIONS SUCH AS FOOT ULCERS WHICH MAY REQUIRE AMPUTATION, EYE DISEASE LEADING TO BLINDNESS, AND KIDNEY FAILURE. THE MOST COMMON LONG-TERM COMPLICATION OF DIABETES AFFECTING OVER 50% OF THE DIABETIC POPULATION IS NERVE DISEASE OR DIABETIC NEUROPATHY. DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY (DPN) IS THE PRIMARY TRIGGER FOR DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS WHICH MAY PROGRESS TO THE POINT OF REQUIRING AMPUTATION. PEOPLE WITH DIABETES HAVE A 15-25% LIFETIME RISK OF FOOT ULCERS AND APPROXIMATELY 15% OF FOOT ULCERS LEAD TO AMPUTATION. FOOT ULCERS ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE COMPLICATION OF DIABETES WITH A TYPICAL COST OF $5,000 TO $50,000 PER EPISODE. IN ADDITION, BETWEEN 16% AND 26% OF PEOPLE WITH DIABETES SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN IN THEIR FEET AND LOWER LEGS.  EARLY DETECTION OF DPN IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TREATMENT OPTIONS ONCE THE NERVES HAVE DEGENERATED. TODAY\u2019S DIAGNOSTIC METHODS FOR DPN RANGE FROM A SIMPLE MONOFILAMENT TEST FOR LACK OF SENSORY PERCEPTION IN THE FEET TO A NERVE CONDUCTION STUDY PERFORMED BY A SPECIALIST. OUR DPNCHECK TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES A RAPID, LOW COST, QUANTITATIVE TEST FOR PERIPHERAL NERVE DISEASE, INCLUDING DPN. IT ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT MEDICAL NEED AND IS PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN MASS SCREENINGS OF POPULATIONS THAT ARE LIKELY SUSCEPTIBLE TO DPN. DPNCHECK HAS BEEN VALIDATED IN NUMEROUS CLINICAL STUDIES.  IN 2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A COLLABORATION WITH GLAXOSMITHKLINE (\"GSK\"). THE GSK COLLABORATION ESTABLISHED A FRAMEWORK FOR THE JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF QUELL, RECENTLY LAUNCHED IN THE UNITED STATES IN SEPTEMBER 2018, AND TO BE LAUNCHED BY GSK INTERNATIONALLY, AND THE ASSIGNMENT OF AREAS OF MARKETING RESPONSIBILITY. THE INITIAL TERM OF THE GSK COLLABORATION RUNS THROUGH 2020. THROUGH JUNE 30, 2019, GSK HAS PAID THE COMPANY $19.5 MILLION IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS. GSK HAS COMMITTED TO FUTURE PERFORMANCE MILESTONE PAYMENTS TOTALING UP TO $5.5 MILLION AND AGREED TO CO-FUND QUELL DEVELOPMENT COSTS STARTING IN 2019.

FUNDING FOR OUR OPERATIONS LARGELY DEPENDS ON REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF OUR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND NEUROPATHY, AND ON ACHIEVEMENT OF MILESTONES UNDER THE GSK COLLABORATION. A LOW LEVEL OF MARKET INTEREST IN QUELL OR DPNCHECK, A DECLINE IN OUR CONSUMABLES SALES, UNANTICIPATED INCREASES IN OUR OPERATING COSTS, OR UNANTICIPATED SETBACKS TOWARD THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE GSK MILESTONES WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CASH.

AMOUNTS BORROWED UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST EQUAL TO THE PRIME RATE PLUS 0.5% AND ARE COLLATERALIZED BY CASH, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY, AND EQUIPMENT. THE CREDIT FACILITY INCLUDES TRADITIONAL LENDING AND REPORTING COVENANTS.

WE HAVE SUFFERED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS AND NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN FOR THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS UNCERTAINTY. WE HELD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $5.0 MILLION  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  . WE BELIEVE THAT THESE RESOURCES, FUTURE GSK COLLABORATION MILESTONE PAYMENTS, AND THE CASH TO BE GENERATED FROM FUTURE PRODUCT SALES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR PROJECTED OPERATING REQUIREMENTS THROUGH 2019. ACCORDINGLY, WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL NEEDS IN 2020. WE CONTINUE TO FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND UNCERTAINTIES AND, AS A RESULT, OUR AVAILABLE CAPITAL RESOURCES MAY BE CONSUMED MORE RAPIDLY THAN CURRENTLY EXPECTED DUE TO (A) DECREASES IN SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS; (B) CHANGES WE MAY MAKE TO THE BUSINESS THAT AFFECT ONGOING OPERATING EXPENSES; (C) CHANGES WE MAY MAKE IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY; (D) REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS; (E) CHANGES WE MAY MAKE IN OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING PLANS; (F) DELAYS IN THE TIMING OF ACHIEVING GSK MILESTONES; (G) THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND ENFORCEMENT ACTION INVOLVING QUELL; AND (H) OTHER ITEMS AFFECTING OUR FORECASTED LEVEL OF EXPENDITURES AND USE OF CASH RESOURCES. WE MAY ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH ACHIEVEMENT OF MILESTONES UNDER THE GSK COLLABORATION, PUBLIC OR PRIVATE FINANCING, COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH STRATEGIC PARTNERS, OR THROUGH ADDITIONAL CREDIT LINES OR OTHER DEBT FINANCING SOURCES. HOWEVER, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE SUCH FUNDING IN A TIMELY MANNER OR ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 WITH THE SEC COVERING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES FOR SALE, GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE FUNDING WHEN NEEDED OR OTHERWISE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE AT PRICES AND ON TERMS TO BE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF ANY SUCH OFFERINGS. HOWEVER, PURSUANT TO THE INSTRUCTIONS TO FORM S-3, WE ONLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO SELL SHARES UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, DURING ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD, IN AN AMOUNT LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO ONE-THIRD OF THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK HELD BY NON-AFFILIATES. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY ISSUING EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES, EITHER THROUGH THE SALE OF SECURITIES PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR BY OTHER MEANS, OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE DILUTION, AND THE NEW EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES MAY HAVE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND PRIVILEGES SENIOR TO THOSE OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH COLLABORATION, LICENSING OR OTHER SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS, IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO RELINQUISH VALUABLE RIGHTS TO OUR POTENTIAL PRODUCTS OR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES, OR GRANT LICENSES ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT FAVORABLE TO US. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDS, WE MAY BE FORCED TO DELAY, SCALE BACK OR ELIMINATE SOME OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, OR OTHER OPERATIONS AND POTENTIALLY DELAY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS. IF ANY OF THESE EVENTS OCCURS, OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION GOALS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  18  OUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET UNDER THE SYMBOL \u201cNURO.\u201d ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTINUED LISTING ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET IS MAINTENANCE OF A MINIMUM CLOSING BID PRICE OF $1.00.

IN ORDER TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE, SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK MUST MAINTAIN A MINIMUM BID CLOSING PRICE OF AT LEAST $1.00 PER SHARE FOR A MINIMUM OF TEN CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS. IF WE DO NOT REGAIN COMPLIANCE BY DECEMBER 2, 2019, NASDAQ WILL PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO US THAT OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE DELISTED. AT THAT TIME, WE MAY APPEAL NASDAQ\u2019S DELISTING DETERMINATION TO A NASDAQ LISTING QUALIFICATIONS PANEL. ALTERNATIVELY, WE MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR AN ADDITIONAL 180 DAY GRACE PERIOD IF WE SATISFY ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS, OTHER THAN THE MINIMUM BID PRICE REQUIREMENT, FOR LISTING ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET SET FORTH IN NASDAQ LISTING RULE 5505. THE NOTIFICATION LETTER HAS NO EFFECT AT THIS TIME ON THE LISTING OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET. WE INTEND TO ACTIVELY MONITOR THE BID PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK BETWEEN NOW AND DECEMBER 2, 2019.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $99.3 MILLION AND $101.9 MILLION IN 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED $128.2 MILLION OF CASH IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, AND WERE A USE OF $73.3 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THIS INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMOUNTS BORROWED FROM OUR FACILITY TO FUND THE ARC ACQUISITION. WE RETURNED $36.7 MILLION TO STOCKHOLDERS FROM STOCK REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS IN 2019 COMPARED TO $203.4 MILLION IN 2018.  FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE CURRENT PORTION OF DEBT INCLUDED $9.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE EURO TERM LOAN. THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT SCHEDULED DEBT MATURITY WILL NOT OCCUR UNTIL 2024, WHEN THE FACILITY MATURES.  CERTAIN SALES AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES, DATA PROCESSING EQUIPMENT AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ARE LEASED UNDER OPERATING LEASES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS, AND APPLY JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.  WE BASE OUR ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT TRENDS AND OTHER FACTORS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES TO BE RELEVANT AT THE TIME OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED.  ON A REGULAR BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS TO ENSURE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PRESENTED FAIRLY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE FUTURE EVENTS AND THEIR EFFECTS CANNOT BE DETERMINED WITH CERTAINTY, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES, AND SUCH DIFFERENCES COULD BE MATERIAL.  23  WE DESCRIBE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 201  8.  S  IGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES SUBSEQUENT TO THE FILING OF OUR FORM 10-K, RELATE  TO THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC  842  ,  LEASES  , AS DISCUSSED IN NOTES 1 AND  4  TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION, INVESTIGATIONS AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL, EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS. WE ESTIMATE AND ACCRUE OUR LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM SUCH MATTERS BASED UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STAGE OF THE PROCEEDING; POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT VALUE; ASSESSMENTS BY INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COUNSEL; AND ASSESSMENTS BY ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERS AND CONSULTANTS OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND REMEDIATION COSTS.  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY ACCRUED FOR THESE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES; HOWEVER, FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY CHANGE, SUCH AS NEW DEVELOPMENTS, OR A CHANGE IN APPROACH, INCLUDING A CHANGE IN SETTLEMENT STRATEGY OR IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION PLAN, THAT COULD CAUSE THE ACTUAL LIABILITY TO EXCEED THE ESTIMATES, OR MAY REQUIRE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RECORDED LIABILITY BALANCES IN THE FUTURE.  OUR ESTIMATE OF LIABILITY AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY AND OUR REMAINING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REMEDIATE THE LOWER PASSAIC RIVER IN NEW JERSEY AND OTHER SITES ARE ACCRUED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, OUR AGGREGATE ENVIRONMENTAL RELATED ACCRUALS WERE $2.6 MILLION, OF WHICH $0.7 MILLION WAS INCLUDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES, WITH THE REMAINDER INCLUDED IN NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES. AS RELATED TO CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, THE ACCRUAL WAS ESTIMATED AT THE LOW END OF A RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES SINCE NO AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE THAN ANY OTHER AMOUNT.  IF WE HAD ACCRUED AT THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, FOR THOSE SITES WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE OUR LIABILITY, OUR ACCRUAL WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION HIGHER.  THESE ACCRUALS CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE NATURE OR EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE METHODS OF REMEDIATION REQUIRED, CHANGES IN THE APPORTIONMENT OF COSTS AMONG RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE COVERAGE AND OTHER ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES OR PRIVATE PARTIES, OR THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF BEING NAMED IN A NEW MATTER.

REVENUES  OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND HEAVILY ON SUCCESSFULLY LEASING AND OPERATING THE OFFICE SPACE IN OUR PORTFOLIO. ECONOMIC GROWTH AND OFFICE EMPLOYMENT LEVELS IN OUR CORE MARKETS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, IN PREDICTING OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.  THE KEY COMPONENTS AFFECTING OUR RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES ARE AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, RENTAL RATES, COST RECOVERY INCOME, NEW DEVELOPMENTS PLACED IN SERVICE, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS. AVERAGE OCCUPANCY GENERALLY INCREASES DURING TIMES OF IMPROVING ECONOMIC GROWTH, AS OUR ABILITY TO LEASE SPACE OUTPACES VACANCIES THAT OCCUR UPON THE EXPIRATIONS OF EXISTING LEASES. AVERAGE OCCUPANCY GENERALLY DECLINES DURING TIMES OF SLOWER OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH, WHEN NEW VACANCIES TEND TO OUTPACE OUR ABILITY TO LEASE SPACE. ASSET ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS PLACED IN SERVICE DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR RENTAL REVENUES AND COULD IMPACT OUR AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, DEPENDING UPON THE OCCUPANCY RATE OF THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE ACQUIRED, SOLD OR PLACED IN SERVICE. A FURTHER INDICATOR OF THE PREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE REVENUES IS THE EXPECTED LEASE EXPIRATIONS OF OUR PORTFOLIO. AS A RESULT, IN ADDITION TO SEEKING TO INCREASE OUR AVERAGE OCCUPANCY BY LEASING CURRENT VACANT SPACE, WE ALSO CONCENTRATE OUR LEASING EFFORTS ON RENEWING EXISTING LEASES PRIOR TO EXPIRATION. FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING OUR LEASE EXPIRATIONS, SEE \"PROPERTIES - LEASE EXPIRATIONS\" IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. OCCUPANCY IN OUR OFFICE PORTFOLIO DECREASED FROM  91.6%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  TO  90.5%  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  . WE EXPECT AVERAGE OCCUPANCY FOR OUR OFFICE PORTFOLIO TO BE APPROXIMATELY  91%  FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  WHETHER OR NOT OUR RENTAL REVENUE TRACKS AVERAGE OCCUPANCY PROPORTIONALLY DEPENDS UPON WHETHER GAAP RENTS UNDER SIGNED NEW AND RENEWAL LEASES ARE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE GAAP RENTS UNDER EXPIRING LEASES. ANNUALIZED RENTAL REVENUES FROM SECOND GENERATION LEASES EXPIRING DURING ANY PARTICULAR YEAR ARE TYPICALLY LESS THAN 15% OF OUR TOTAL ANNUAL RENTAL REVENUES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH INFORMATION REGARDING SECOND GENERATION OFFICE LEASES SIGNED DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  (WE DEFINE SECOND GENERATION OFFICE LEASES AS LEASES WITH NEW CUSTOMERS AND RENEWALS OF EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN OFFICE SPACE THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED UNDER OUR OWNERSHIP AND LEASES WITH RESPECT TO VACANT SPACE IN ACQUIRED BUILDINGS).  NEW  RENEWAL  ALL OFFICE  LEASED SPACE (IN RENTABLE SQUARE FEET)  328,989  746,761  1,075,750  AVERAGE TERM (IN YEARS - RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT WEIGHTED)  6.7  5.0  5.5  BASE RENTS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $30.39  $30.69  $30.60  RENT CONCESSIONS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  (1.00  )  (0.25  )  (0.48  )  GAAP RENTS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $29.39  $30.44  $30.12  TENANT IMPROVEMENTS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $4.97  $2.21  $3.05  LEASING COMMISSIONS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $1.11  $0.87  $0.94  __________  (1)  WEIGHTED AVERAGE PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  ANNUAL COMBINED GAAP RENTS FOR NEW AND RENEWAL LEASES SIGNED IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER WERE  $30.12  PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT,  16.8%  HIGHER  COMPARED TO PREVIOUS LEASES IN THE SAME OFFICE SPACES.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSE, STABLE AND CREDITWORTHY CUSTOMER BASE. WE HAVE AN INTERNAL GUIDELINE WHEREBY CUSTOMERS THAT ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 3% OF OUR REVENUES ARE PERIODICALLY REVIEWED WITH THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , NO CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN  3%  OF OUR CASH REVENUES OTHER THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR LESS THAN  5%  OF OUR CASH REVENUES ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. UPON COMPLETION OF THE METLIFE III DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN RALEIGH, IT IS EXPECTED THAT METLIFE WILL ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY  3.4%  OF OUR REVENUES BASED ON ANNUALIZED CASH REVENUES FOR  JUNE 2019.  EXPENSES  OUR EXPENSES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF RENTAL PROPERTY EXPENSES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND INTEREST EXPENSE. FROM TIME TO TIME, EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS. RENTAL PROPERTY EXPENSES ARE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF RENTAL PROPERTIES AND INCLUDE EXPENSES THAT VARY SOMEWHAT PROPORTIONATELY TO OCCUPANCY LEVELS, SUCH AS JANITORIAL SERVICES AND UTILITIES, AND EXPENSES THAT DO NOT VARY BASED ON OCCUPANCY, SUCH AS PROPERTY TAXES AND INSURANCE. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION IS A NON-CASH EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE OWNERSHIP OF REAL PROPERTY AND GENERALLY REMAINS RELATIVELY CONSISTENT EACH YEAR, UNLESS WE BUY, PLACE IN SERVICE OR SELL ASSETS, SINCE OUR PROPERTIES AND RELATED BUILDING AND TENANT IMPROVEMENT ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER FIXED LIVES. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEE SALARIES AND BENEFITS, CORPORATE OVERHEAD AND SHORT AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  NET OPERATING INCOME  WHETHER OR NOT WE RECORD INCREASING SAME PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME (\u201cNOI\u201d) DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO GARNER HIGHER RENTAL REVENUES, WHETHER FROM HIGHER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, HIGHER GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT OR HIGHER COST RECOVERY INCOME, THAT EXCEED ANY CORRESPONDING GROWTH IN OPERATING EXPENSES. SAME PROPERTY NOI WAS  $2.6 MILLION  , OR  2.3%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SAME PROPERTY REVENUES OF  $3.4 MILLION  OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF  $0.7 MILLION  IN SAME PROPERTY EXPENSES. WE EXPECT SAME PROPERTY NOI TO BE HIGHER IN THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 AS HIGHER RENTAL REVENUES, MOSTLY FROM HIGHER AVERAGE GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT, ARE EXPECTED TO MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER EXPECTED AVERAGE OCCUPANCY AND AN ANTICIPATED INCREASE IN SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES.  IN ADDITION TO THE EFFECT OF SAME PROPERTY NOI, WHETHER OR NOT NOI INCREASES DEPENDS UPON WHETHER THE NOI FROM OUR ACQUIRED PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE EXCEEDS THE NOI FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS. NOI WAS  $4.4 MILLION  , OR  3.7%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO THE IMPACT OF DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE, PARTLY OFFSET BY NOI LOST FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS AND LOWER RESTORATION FEES. WE EXPECT NOI TO BE HIGHER IN THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 DUE TO THE IMPACT OF OUR NET INVESTMENT ACTIVITY IN SUCH PERIODS.  CASH FLOWS  IN CALCULATING NET CASH RELATED TO OPERATING ACTIVITIES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, WHICH ARE NON-CASH EXPENSES, ARE ADDED BACK TO NET INCOME. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY GENERATED A POSITIVE AMOUNT OF CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON CHANGES IN OUR NET INCOME, AS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY BELOW UNDER \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d CHANGES IN RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES AND NET ADDITIONS OR DECREASES IN OUR OVERALL PORTFOLIO.  NET CASH RELATED TO INVESTING ACTIVITIES GENERALLY RELATES TO CAPITALIZED COSTS INCURRED FOR LEASING AND MAJOR BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS AND OUR ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT, DISPOSITION AND JOINT VENTURE ACTIVITY. DURING PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT NET ACQUISITION AND/OR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY, OUR CASH USED IN SUCH INVESTING ACTIVITIES WILL GENERALLY EXCEED CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES, WHICH TYPICALLY CONSISTS OF CASH RECEIVED UPON THE SALE OF PROPERTIES AND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR JOINT VENTURES.  NET CASH RELATED TO FINANCING ACTIVITIES GENERALLY RELATES TO DISTRIBUTIONS, INCURRENCE AND REPAYMENT OF DEBT, AND ISSUANCES, REPURCHASES OR REDEMPTIONS OF COMMON STOCK, COMMON UNITS AND PREFERRED STOCK. WE USE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR CASH TO FUND DISTRIBUTIONS. WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE INCREASES IN THE OUTSTANDING BALANCES OF DEBT DURING A PERIOD DEPENDS GENERALLY UPON THE NET EFFECT OF OUR ACQUISITION, DISPOSITION, DEVELOPMENT AND JOINT VENTURE ACTIVITY. WE GENERALLY USE OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR DAILY WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES, WHICH MEANS THAT DURING ANY GIVEN PERIOD, IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE INTEREST EXPENSE, WE MAY RECORD SIGNIFICANT REPAYMENTS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  FOR A DISCUSSION REGARDING DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS, SEE \"LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.\"  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN A CONSERVATIVE AND FLEXIBLE BALANCE SHEET WITH ACCESS TO MULTIPLE SOURCES OF DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL AND SUFFICIENT AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT ALLOWS US TO CAPITALIZE ON FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY ARISE.  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES ARE OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF FUNDS TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS INCLUDE AVAILABLE WORKING CAPITAL AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH HAD  $478.9 MILLION  OF AVAILABILITY AT  JULY 16, 2019  . OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF OPERATING EXPENSES, INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL AMORTIZATION ON OUR DEBT, DISTRIBUTIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING BUILDING IMPROVEMENT COSTS, TENANT IMPROVEMENT COSTS AND LEASE COMMISSIONS. BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITAL COSTS TO MAINTAIN OR ENHANCE EXISTING BUILDINGS NOT TYPICALLY RELATED TO A SPECIFIC CUSTOMER. TENANT IMPROVEMENTS ARE THE COSTS REQUIRED TO CUSTOMIZE SPACE FOR THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND PLANNED FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. WE USE OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES AND FOR THE SHORT-TERM FUNDING OF OUR DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE REPAYMENT OF OTHER DEBT. CONTINUED ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ALLOWS US TO QUICKLY CAPITALIZE ON STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES AT SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES.  OUR LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY USES GENERALLY CONSIST OF THE RETIREMENT OR REFINANCING OF DEBT UPON MATURITY, FUNDING OF BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS, NEW BUILDING DEVELOPMENTS AND LAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND FUNDING ACQUISITIONS OF BUILDINGS AND DEVELOPMENT LAND. OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR STARTED AND/OR COMMITTED NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WERE APPROXIMATELY  $316 MILLION  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  . ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, RETIRE OUTSTANDING EQUITY AND/OR DEBT SECURITIES THROUGH REDEMPTIONS, OPEN MARKET REPURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED ACQUISITIONS OR OTHERWISE.  WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF.  \u2022  CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES;  \u2022  BANK TERM LOANS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY;  \u2022  THE ISSUANCE OF UNSECURED DEBT;  \u2022  THE ISSUANCE OF SECURED DEBT;  \u2022  THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE COMPANY OR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP; AND  \u2022  THE DISPOSITION OF NON-CORE ASSETS.  AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , OUR LEVERAGE RATIO, AS MEASURED BY THE RATIO OF OUR MORTGAGES AND NOTES PAYABLE AND OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK TO THE UNDEPRECIATED BOOK VALUE OF OUR ASSETS, WAS  35.9%  AND THERE WERE  106.4 MILLION  DILUTED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING.  INVESTMENT ACTIVITY  AS NOTED ABOVE, A KEY TENET OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN IS TO CONTINUOUSLY UPGRADE THE QUALITY OF OUR OFFICE PORTFOLIO THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND DEVELOPMENT. WE GENERALLY SEEK TO ACQUIRE AND DEVELOP OFFICE BUILDINGS THAT IMPROVE THE AVERAGE QUALITY OF OUR OVERALL PORTFOLIO AND DELIVER CONSISTENT AND SUSTAINABLE VALUE FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS OVER THE LONG-TERM. WHETHER OR NOT AN ASSET ACQUISITION OR NEW DEVELOPMENT RESULTS IN HIGHER PER SHARE NET INCOME OR FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\"FFO\") IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE NOI FOR ANY SUCH PERIOD EXCEEDS THE ACTUAL COST OF CAPITAL USED TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT. ADDITIONALLY, GIVEN THE LENGTH OF CONSTRUCTION CYCLES, DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE NOT PLACED IN SERVICE UNTIL, IN SOME CASES, SEVERAL YEARS AFTER COMMENCEMENT. SALES OF NON-CORE ASSETS COULD RESULT IN LOWER PER SHARE NET INCOME OR FFO IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD IN THE EVENT THE RESULTING USE OF PROCEEDS DOES NOT EXCEED THE CAPITALIZATION RATE ON THE SOLD PROPERTIES.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE  $5.3 MILLION  , OR  3.0%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY REVENUES, WHICH INCREASED RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES BY $6.4 MILLION AND $3.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT AND HIGHER PARKING INCOME, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY LOST REVENUE FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS AND LOWER RESTORATION FEES, WHICH DECREASED RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES BY $2.8 MILLION AND $1.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPECT RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES TO BE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY REVENUES, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOST REVENUE FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  OPERATING EXPENSES  RENTAL PROPERTY AND OTHER EXPENSES WERE  $0.9 MILLION  , OR  1.5%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES BY $1.2 MILLION AND $0.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES AND INSURANCE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY A $1.1 MILLION DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS. WE EXPECT RENTAL PROPERTY AND OTHER EXPENSES TO BE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS  $2.8 MILLION  , OR  4.9%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY LEASE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, PARTLY OFFSET BY FULLY AMORTIZED ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS. WE EXPECT DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION TO BE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 FOR SIMILAR REASONS.  WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF  $0.5 MILLION  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  , WHICH RESULTED FROM A CHANGE IN MARKET-BASED INPUTS AND OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF THE ASSETS. WE RECORDED NO SUCH IMPAIRMENT IN  2018.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE RELATIVELY UNCHANGED IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED LEASE RELATED COSTS THAT ARE NOW EXPENSED UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD IN 2019 AND HIGHER COMPANY-WIDE BASE SALARIES AND BENEFITS OFFSET BY LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND LOWER EXPENSED PRE-DEVELOPMENT COSTS. WE EXPECT GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 TO BE RELATIVELY CONSISTENT TO 2018 FOR SIMILAR REASONS.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $2.5 MILLION  , OR  13.9%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES, HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES AND LOWER CAPITALIZED INTEREST. WE EXPECT INTEREST EXPENSE TO BE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 FOR SIMILAR REASONS.  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS)  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS) WAS  $0.1 MILLION  LOWER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INTEREST INCOME.  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY WERE  $10.3 MILLION  LOWER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO THE NET EFFECT OF THE DISPOSITION ACTIVITY IN SUCH PERIODS.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES WAS  $0.2 MILLION  , OR  40.1%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY. WE EXPECT EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES TO BE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 FOR THE SAME REASON.  EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE - DILUTED  DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WAS  $0.11  LOWER  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO A DECREASE IN NET INCOME FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  2018  LASER SPINE INSTITUTE  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE PROVIDED INFORMATION ON LASER SPINE INSTITUTE, WHICH OCCUPIED A 176,000 SQUARE-FOOT, SIX-STORY BUILDING WITH STRUCTURED PARKING IN TAMPA\u2019S WESTSHORE SUBMARKET, A BBD. THE BUILDING, DEVELOPED BY US, HAD BEEN USED BY LASER SPINE INSTITUTE FOR BOTH ITS COMPANY HEADQUARTERS AND AN AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTER. AFTER THE MARKET CLOSED ON MARCH 1, 2019, LASER SPINE INSTITUTE ANNOUNCED IT WOULD IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE ITS OPERATIONS. THIS UNEXPECTED ANNOUNCEMENT AFFECTED ALL OF ITS LOCATIONS NATIONWIDE. AS A RESULT OF THIS SUDDEN CLOSURE, WE INCURRED $5.6 MILLION OF CREDIT LOSSES ON OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES AND WRITE-OFFS OF $2.3 MILLION OF LEASE INCENTIVES, $4.1 MILLION OF NOTES RECEIVABLE AND $11.6 MILLION OF TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND DEFERRED LEASING COSTS.  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE  $2.8 MILLION  , OR  0.8%  ,  LOWER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS, LOWER SAME PROPERTY REVENUES AND LOWER RESTORATION FEES, WHICH DECREASED RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES BY $5.3 MILLION, $4.1 MILLION AND $3.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE LOWER PRIMARILY DUE TO CREDIT LOSSES ON OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES AND WRITE-OFFS OF LEASE INCENTIVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LASER SPINE INSTITUTE, PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AVERAGE GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT AND HIGHER PARKING INCOME. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER REVENUE OF $10.4 MILLION FROM DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE.  OPERATING EXPENSES  RENTAL PROPERTY AND OTHER EXPENSES WERE  $2.0 MILLION  , OR  1.7%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES BY $2.1 MILLION AND $1.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES AND REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER UTILITIES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY A $1.7 MILLION DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS  $14.4 MILLION  , OR  12.6%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND DEFERRED LEASING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LASER SPINE INSTITUTE AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE, PARTLY OFFSET BY PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF  $0.5 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  , WHICH RESULTED FROM A CHANGE IN MARKET-BASED INPUTS AND OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF THE ASSETS. WE RECORDED NO SUCH IMPAIRMENT IN  2018.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  $0.6 MILLION  , OR  2.9%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED LEASE RELATED COSTS THAT ARE NOW EXPENSED UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD IN 2019 AND HIGHER COMPANY-WIDE BASE SALARIES AND BENEFITS, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND EXPENSED PRE-DEVELOPMENT COSTS.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $2.8 MILLION  , OR  7.8%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES AND HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS)  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS) WAS  $4.4 MILLION  LOWER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO THE WRITE-OFF OF NOTES RECEIVABLE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LASER SPINE INSTITUTE.  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY WERE  $10.3 MILLION  LOWER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO THE NET EFFECT OF THE DISPOSITION ACTIVITY IN SUCH PERIODS.  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES WAS  $0.4 MILLION  , OR  33.8%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY.  EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE - DILUTED  DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WAS  $0.35  LOWER  IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO A DECREASE IN NET INCOME FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS  WE REPORT AND ANALYZE OUR CASH FLOWS BASED ON OPERATING ACTIVITIES, INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE CHANGES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH FLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).

WE EXPECT NET CASH RELATED TO OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 TO BE HIGHER AS COMPARED TO 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND SAME PROPERTIES, PARTLY OFFSET BY PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ACQUISITION ACTIVITY AND HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN DEVELOPMENT IN-PROCESS IN 2018. WE EXPECT USES OF CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 TO BE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY WHETHER OR NOT WE ACQUIRE OR COMMENCE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE BBDS OF OUR MARKETS. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY  $316 MILLION  LEFT TO FUND OF OUR PREVIOUSLY-ANNOUNCED DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY IN 2019 AND FUTURE YEARS. WE EXPECT THESE USES OF CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WILL BE PARTLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET DEBT BORROWINGS IN 2019. ASSUMING THE NET EFFECT OF OUR ACQUISITION, DISPOSITION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY IN 2019 RESULTS IN AN INCREASE TO OUR ASSETS, WE WOULD EXPECT OUTSTANDING DEBT AND/OR COMMON STOCK BALANCES TO INCREASE.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CAPITALIZATION  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE COMPANY\u2019S CAPITALIZATION (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS).

THE SECURED INDEBTEDNESS WAS COLLATERALIZED BY REAL ESTATE ASSETS WITH AN UNDEPRECIATED BOOK VALUE OF  $146.2 MILLION  . AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  ,  $486.0 MILLION  OF OUR DEBT DOES NOT BEAR INTEREST AT FIXED RATES OR IS NOT PROTECTED BY INTEREST RATE HEDGE CONTRACTS.  INVESTMENT ACTIVITY  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE REGULARLY EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS. AS A RESULT, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY HAVE ONE OR MORE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION THAT ARE IN VARYING STAGES OF EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION OR DUE DILIGENCE, INCLUDING POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO NON-BINDING LETTERS OF INTENT OR ENFORCEABLE CONTRACTS. CONSUMMATION OF ANY TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING THE SATISFACTION OF CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE PROVIDED THAT WE WILL ACQUIRE ANY PROPERTIES IN THE FUTURE. SEE \"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - RECENT AND FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES MAY FAIL TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS AND MAY REQUIRE RENOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS EXCEEDING OUR ESTIMATES\" IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE AND THE BROMLEY COMPANIES FORMED A JOINT VENTURE (THE \"MIDTOWN ONE JOINT VENTURE\u201d) TO CONSTRUCT MIDTOWN ONE, A  150,000  SQUARE FOOT, MULTI-CUSTOMER OFFICE BUILDING LOCATED IN THE MIXED-USE MIDTOWN TAMPA PROJECT IN TAMPA\u2019S WESTSHORE SUBMARKET. MIDTOWN ONE HAS AN ANTICIPATED TOTAL INVESTMENT OF  $71.3 MILLION  . CONSTRUCTION OF MIDTOWN ONE IS PROJECTED TO BEGIN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 WITH A SCHEDULED COMPLETION DATE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2021. AT CLOSING, WE AGREED TO CONTRIBUTE CASH OF  $20.0 MILLION  (  $12.8 MILLION  OF WHICH WAS FUNDED AND/OR PLACED IN ESCROW AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  ) IN EXCHANGE FOR AN  80.0%  INTEREST IN THE MIDTOWN ONE JOINT VENTURE AND THE BROMLEY COMPANIES CONTRIBUTED LAND VALUED AT  $5.0 MILLION  IN EXCHANGE FOR THE REMAINING  20.0%  INTEREST. WE ALSO COMMITTED TO PROVIDE A  $46.3 MILLION  INTEREST-ONLY SECURED CONSTRUCTION LOAN TO THE MIDTOWN ONE JOINT VENTURE THAT IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE ON THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF COMPLETION. THE LOAN BEARS INTEREST AT  LIBOR PLUS 250 BASIS POINTS  . AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , NO AMOUNTS UNDER THE LOAN HAVE BEEN FUNDED. THE MIDTOWN ONE JOINT VENTURE IS CONSOLIDATED.  ON JULY 3, 2019, WE SOLD LAND PARCELS FOR AN AGGREGATE SALE PRICE OF  $7.3 MILLION  AND EXPECT TO RECORD NOMINAL AGGREGATE LOSSES ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY.  ON JULY 8, 2019, WE SOLD A BUILDING FOR A SALE PRICE OF  $4.7 MILLION  AND EXPECT TO RECORD A GAIN ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY OF  $2.6 MILLION.  ON JULY 12, 2019, WE ACQUIRED DEVELOPMENT LAND IN RALEIGH FOR A PURCHASE PRICE, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED ACQUISITION COSTS, OF  $6.6 MILLION.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE SOLD  TWO  BUILDINGS AND LAND FOR AN AGGREGATE SALE PRICE OF  $32.5 MILLION  AND RECORDED AGGREGATE GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY OF  $6.7 MILLION.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF  $0.5 MILLION  , WHICH RESULTED FROM A CHANGE IN MARKET-BASED INPUTS AND OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF THE ASSETS.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  , WE WERE DEVELOPING  0.8 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE PROPERTIES.

RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN LAND HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS, NOT DEVELOPMENT IN-PROCESS.  FINANCING ACTIVITY  WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SEPARATE EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WITH EACH OF WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, ROBERT W. BAIRD & CO. INCORPORATED, BB&T CAPITAL MARKETS, A DIVISION OF BB&T SECURITIES, LLC, MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED, BTIG, LLC, CAPITAL ONE SECURITIES, INC., FIFTH THIRD SECURITIES, INC., JEFFERIES LLC AND J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY MAY OFFER AND SELL UP TO $300.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE GROSS SALES PRICE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH SUCH FIRMS, ACTING AS AGENTS OF THE COMPANY OR AS PRINCIPALS. SALES OF THE SHARES, IF ANY, MAY BE MADE BY MEANS OF ORDINARY BROKERS\u2019 TRANSACTIONS ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (\"NYSE\") OR OTHERWISE AT MARKET PRICES PREVAILING AT THE TIME OF SALE, AT PRICES RELATED TO PREVAILING MARKET PRICES OR AT NEGOTIATED PRICES OR AS OTHERWISE AGREED WITH ANY OF SUCH FIRMS.  OUR $600.0 MILLION  UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN  JANUARY 2022  AND INCLUDES AN ACCORDION FEATURE THAT ALLOWS FOR AN ADDITIONAL  $400.0 MILLION  OF BORROWING CAPACITY SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL LENDER COMMITMENTS. ASSUMING NO DEFAULTS HAVE OCCURRED, WE HAVE AN OPTION TO EXTEND THE MATURITY FOR  TWO  ADDITIONAL  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS. THE INTEREST RATE AT OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS IS  LIBOR PLUS 100 BASIS POINTS  AND THE ANNUAL FACILITY FEE IS 20 BASIS POINTS. THE INTEREST RATE AND FACILITY FEE ARE BASED ON THE HIGHER OF THE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED RATINGS FROM MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE OR STANDARD & POOR'S RATINGS SERVICES. THERE WAS  $136.0 MILLION  AND  $121.0 MILLION  OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  JULY 16, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. AT BOTH  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  JULY 16, 2019  , WE HAD  $0.1 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT, WHICH REDUCES THE AVAILABILITY ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. AS A RESULT, THE UNUSED CAPACITY OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  JULY 16, 2019  WAS $463.9 MILLION  AND  $478.9 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  WE ARE CURRENTLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED DEBT. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AND RATIOS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT YEAR, DEPENDING UPON OUR FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE, PROPERTY AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE.  OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND BANK TERM LOANS REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH CUSTOMARY OPERATING COVENANTS AND VARIOUS FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. UPON AN EVENT OF DEFAULT ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE LENDERS HAVING AT LEAST 51.0% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CAN ACCELERATE ALL BORROWINGS THEN OUTSTANDING, AND WE COULD BE PROHIBITED FROM BORROWING ANY FURTHER AMOUNTS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT AGREEMENTS CONTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS GIVING THE UNSECURED LENDERS THE RIGHT TO DECLARE A DEFAULT IF WE ARE IN DEFAULT UNDER MORE THAN $30.0 MILLION WITH RESPECT TO OTHER LOANS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE INDENTURE THAT GOVERNS THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP'S OUTSTANDING NOTES REQUIRES US TO COMPLY WITH CUSTOMARY OPERATING COVENANTS AND VARIOUS FINANCIAL RATIOS. THE TRUSTEE OR THE HOLDERS OF AT LEAST 25.0% IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ANY SERIES OF NOTES CAN ACCELERATE THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SUCH SERIES UPON WRITTEN NOTICE OF A DEFAULT THAT REMAINS UNCURED AFTER 60 DAYS.  WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPAY, REFINANCE OR EXTEND ANY OR ALL OF OUR DEBT AT MATURITY OR UPON ANY ACCELERATION. IF ANY REFINANCING IS DONE AT HIGHER INTEREST RATES, THE INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW AND ABILITY TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS. ANY SUCH REFINANCING COULD ALSO IMPOSE TIGHTER FINANCIAL RATIOS AND OTHER COVENANTS THAT RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COULD OTHERWISE BE IN OUR BEST INTEREST, SUCH AS FUNDING NEW DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY, MAKING OPPORTUNISTIC ACQUISITIONS, REPURCHASING OUR SECURITIES OR PAYING DISTRIBUTIONS.  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS  TO MAINTAIN ITS QUALIFICATION AS A REIT, THE COMPANY MUST PAY DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS THAT ARE AT LEAST 90.0% OF ITS ANNUAL REIT TAXABLE INCOME, EXCLUDING NET CAPITAL GAINS. THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO DISTRIBUTE AT LEAST ENOUGH CASH FOR THE COMPANY TO BE ABLE TO PAY SUCH DIVIDENDS. THE COMPANY'S REIT TAXABLE INCOME, AS DETERMINED BY THE FEDERAL TAX LAWS, DOES NOT EQUAL ITS NET INCOME UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d). IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH CAPITAL GAINS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO MAINTAIN REIT STATUS, CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX UNLESS SUCH GAINS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO STOCKHOLDERS.  CASH DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CASH THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER BUSINESS PURPOSES, INCLUDING FUNDING DEBT MATURITIES, REDUCING DEBT OR FUTURE GROWTH INITIATIVES. THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS THAT WILL BE MADE IS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS THAT WILL AFFECT SUCH CASH FLOWS AND, ACCORDINGLY, INFLUENCE THE DECISIONS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS, SEE \"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS\" IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  , THE COMPANY DECLARED AND PAID A CASH DIVIDEND OF  $0.475  PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK.  CURRENT AND FUTURE CASH NEEDS  WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER AVAILABLE FINANCING SOURCES, INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, THE ISSUANCE OF SECURED DEBT, BANK TERM LOANS, BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE COMPANY OR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND THE DISPOSITION OF NON-CORE ASSETS, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS.  WE HAD  $4.5 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  . THE UNUSED CAPACITY OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT  JUNE 30, 2019  AND  JULY 16, 2019  WAS  $463.9 MILLION  AND  $478.9 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, EXCLUDING AN ACCORDION FEATURE THAT ALLOWS FOR AN ADDITIONAL  $400.0 MILLION  OF BORROWING CAPACITY SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL LENDER COMMITMENTS.  WE HAVE A CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 WITH THE SEC PURSUANT TO WHICH, AT ANY TIME AND FROM TIME TO TIME, IN ONE OR MORE OFFERINGS ON AN AS-NEEDED BASIS, THE COMPANY MAY SELL AN INDEFINITE AMOUNT OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK AND DEPOSITARY SHARES AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP MAY SELL AN INDEFINITE AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURITIES, SUBJECT TO OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT OFFERINGS ON SATISFACTORY TERMS BASED ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS.  THE COMPANY FROM TIME TO TIME ENTERS INTO EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WITH A VARIETY OF FIRMS PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY MAY OFFER AND SELL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH SUCH FIRMS, ACTING AS AGENTS OF THE COMPANY OR AS PRINCIPALS. SALES OF THE SHARES, IF ANY, MAY BE MADE BY MEANS OF ORDINARY BROKERS\u2019 TRANSACTIONS ON THE NYSE OR OTHERWISE AT MARKET PRICES PREVAILING AT THE TIME OF SALE, AT PRICES RELATED TO PREVAILING MARKET PRICES OR AT NEGOTIATED PRICES OR AS OTHERWISE AGREED WITH ANY OF SUCH FIRMS (WHICH MAY INCLUDE BLOCK TRADES).  DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019, WE ALSO EXPECT TO SELL AN ADDITIONAL  $62 MILLION  TO  $112 MILLION  OF PROPERTIES NO LONGER CONSIDERED TO BE CORE ASSETS DUE TO LOCATION, AGE, QUALITY AND/OR OVERALL STRATEGIC FIT. WE CAN MAKE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT WE WILL SELL ANY NON-CORE ASSETS OR, IF WE DO, WHAT THE TIMING OR TERMS OF ANY SUCH SALE WILL BE.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THERE WERE NO CHANGES MADE BY MANAGEMENT TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  OTHER THAN THE NEW LEASE STANDARD ADOPTION EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019, WHICH CHANGED OUR POLICY WITH RESPECT TO ESTIMATING CREDIT LOSSES ON OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THIS POLICY, SEE NOTE 2 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF ALL OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, SEE \u201cMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\u201d IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  NON-GAAP INFORMATION  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE ARE BENEFICIAL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS AND ARE IMPORTANT INDICATORS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY EQUITY REIT. BECAUSE THESE FFO CALCULATIONS EXCLUDE SUCH FACTORS AS DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND GAINS OR LOSSES FROM SALES OF OPERATING REAL ESTATE ASSETS, WHICH CAN VARY AMONG OWNERS OF IDENTICAL ASSETS IN SIMILAR CONDITIONS BASED ON HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING AND USEFUL LIFE ESTIMATES, THEY FACILITATE COMPARISONS OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE BETWEEN PERIODS AND BETWEEN OTHER REITS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP IMPLICITLY ASSUMES THAT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS DIMINISHES PREDICTABLY OVER TIME. SINCE REAL ESTATE VALUES HAVE HISTORICALLY RISEN OR FALLEN WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE USE OF FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE, TOGETHER WITH THE REQUIRED GAAP PRESENTATIONS, PROVIDES A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO ITS COMPETITORS AND A MORE INFORMED AND APPROPRIATE BASIS ON WHICH TO MAKE DECISIONS INVOLVING OPERATING, FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND THEREFORE DO NOT REPRESENT NET INCOME OR NET INCOME PER SHARE AS DEFINED BY GAAP. NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER SHARE AS DEFINED BY GAAP ARE THE MOST RELEVANT MEASURES IN DETERMINING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THESE FFO MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS THAT INVESTORS MAY DEEM SUBJECTIVE, SUCH AS ADDING BACK EXPENSES SUCH AS DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENTS. FURTHERMORE, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE DOES NOT DEPICT THE AMOUNT THAT ACCRUES DIRECTLY TO THE STOCKHOLDERS' BENEFIT.

ACCRETION OF DISCOUNT ON LOANS IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO DECREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS AS LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE BANK TRANSACTIONS ARE REPAID, REFINANCED OR RENEWED. CHANGES IN THE VOLUME OF INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO AS A RESULT OF THE BORO ACQUISITION AND SEASONAL INCREASES IN MORTGAGE WAREHOUSE LENDING VOLUME, INCREASED TAXABLE EQUIVALENT NET INTEREST INCOME DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018. CHANGES IN RATES PAID ON INTEREST-BEARING LIABILITIES DECREASED TAXABLE EQUIVALENT NET INTEREST INCOME DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, DUE TO INCREASES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES. OUR PORTFOLIO INCLUDES LOANS THAT PERIODICALLY REPRICE OR MATURE PRIOR TO THE END OF AN AMORTIZED TERM. SOME OF OUR VARIABLE-RATE LOANS REMAIN AT APPLICABLE RATE FLOORS, WHICH MAY DELAY AND/OR LIMIT CHANGES IN INTEREST INCOME DURING A PERIOD OF CHANGING RATES. IF INTEREST RATES WERE TO FALL, THE IMPACT ON OUR INTEREST INCOME FOR CERTAIN VARIABLE-RATE LOANS WOULD BE LIMITED BY THESE RATE FLOORS. IN ADDITION, DECLINING INTEREST RATES MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDS ON DEPOSITS. THE EXTENT OF THIS IMPACT WILL ULTIMATELY BE DRIVEN BY THE TIMING, MAGNITUDE AND FREQUENCY OF INTEREST RATE AND YIELD CURVE MOVEMENTS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS AND TIMING OF MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. IF INTEREST RATES WERE TO RISE, YIELDS ON THE PORTION OF OUR LOAN PORTFOLIO THAT REMAIN AT APPLICABLE RATE FLOORS WOULD RISE MORE SLOWLY THAN INCREASES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES. ANY CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ACROSS THE TERM STRUCTURE WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT NET INTEREST INCOME AND NET INTEREST MARGIN. THE IMPACT OF RATE MOVEMENTS WILL CHANGE WITH THE SHAPE OF THE YIELD CURVE, INCLUDING ANY CHANGES IN STEEPNESS OR FLATNESS AND INVERSIONS AT ANY POINTS ON THE YIELD CURVE.  65  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u200b  THE BANKING SEGMENT\u2019S NONINTEREST INCOME INCREASED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES IN SERVICE CHARGE INCOME DUE TO THE RESTRUCTURING OF OUR PRODUCTS.  \u200b  THE BANKING SEGMENT\u2019S NONINTEREST EXPENSES DECREASED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN NET EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH PREVIOUSLY COVERED ASSETS, INCLUDING THE FDIC INDEMNIFICATION ASSET DISCUSSED IN THE \u201cFACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d SECTION ABOVE. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, THE BANK WAS THE VICTIM OF A \u201cSPEAR PHISHING\u201d ATTACK WHICH RESULTED IN A WIRE FRAUD LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $4.0 MILLION AND APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION OF OTHER RELATED EXPENSES.

THE INCREASES IN TRADING GAINS DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO A MORE FAVORABLE MARKET ENVIRONMENT RESULTING IN 10% AND 17% RESPECTIVE INCREASES IN TRADING VOLUMES, ENHANCED SPREADS AND 25% AND 18% RESPECTIVE INCREASES IN THE STRUCTURED FINANCE BUSINESS LINE\u2019S TO-BE-ANNOUNCED (\u201cTBA\u201d) MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES VOLUME. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A MORE ROBUST BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN 2019 THAN WE OBSERVED IN 2018 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF RECENT DECREASES IN INTEREST RATES (SEE OTHER NONINTEREST INCOME DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS), INCREASED CUSTOMER DEMAND, IMPROVED PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION, AND OTHER STRATEGIC ENHANCEMENTS. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY $18.8 MILLION AND $28.8 MILLION RESPECTIVE INCREASES IN VARIABLE COMPENSATION BASED ON MORE ROBUST FINANCIAL RESULTS AND, WITH RESPECT TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE $2.2 MILLION IN PRE-TAX COSTS RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 ASSOCIATED WITH LEADERSHIP CHANGES AS NOTED IN THE \u201cFACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d SECTION ABOVE.  \u200b  THE BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT IS SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK AS A CONSEQUENCE OF MAINTAINING INVENTORY POSITIONS, TRADING IN INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND MAINTAINING A MATCHED STOCK LOAN BOOK. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON OUR OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. OUR BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT HAS HISTORICALLY EARNED A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS REVENUES FROM ADVISORY FEES UPON THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF CLIENT TRANSACTIONS. RAPID OR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT\u2019S BOND TRADING, SALES, UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER INTEREST SPREAD-SENSITIVE ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED BELOW. THE BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT ALSO RECEIVES ADMINISTRATIVE FEES FOR PROVIDING MONEY MARKET AND FDIC INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES TO CLIENTS, WHICH TEND TO BE SENSITIVE TO SHORT TERM INTEREST RATES. IN ADDITION, THE PROFITABILITY OF THE BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT DEPENDS, TO AN EXTENT, ON THE SPREAD BETWEEN REVENUES EARNED ON CUSTOMER LOANS AND EXCESS CUSTOMER CASH BALANCES, AND THE INTEREST EXPENSE PAID ON CUSTOMER CASH BALANCES, AS WELL AS THE INTEREST REVENUE EARNED ON TRADING SECURITIES, NET OF FINANCING COSTS.  \u200b  IN THE BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT, INTEREST IS EARNED FROM SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES, INTEREST CHARGED ON CUSTOMER MARGIN LOAN BALANCES AND INTEREST EARNED ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES USED TO SUPPORT SALES, UNDERWRITING AND OTHER CUSTOMER ACTIVITIES. NET INTEREST INCOME DECREASED BETWEEN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, AND THE COMPARABLE PERIODS IN 2018, RESULTING FROM DECREASES IN NET INTEREST INCOME FROM OUR STRUCTURED FINANCE OPERATIONS DUE TO A DECLINE IN POOL INVENTORY FROM JUNE 30, 2018 TO JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECREASES IN NET INTEREST INCOME FROM THE SEGMENT\u2019S STOCK LENDING ACTIVITIES DUE TO 15% AND 13% RESPECTIVE DECREASES IN AVERAGE STOCK LENDING BALANCES. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN NET INTEREST EARNED ON TRADING SECURITIES.  \u200b  NONINTEREST INCOME INCREASED BETWEEN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, AND THE COMPARABLE PERIODS IN 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN OTHER NONINTEREST INCOME AND INVESTMENT AND SECURITIES ADVISORY FEES AND COMMISSIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN SECURITIES COMMISSIONS AND FEES.  \u200b  SECURITIES COMMISSIONS AND FEES DECREASED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN COMMISSIONS EARNED ON MUNICIPAL BOND, OVER-THE-COUNTER SECURITIES AND INSURANCE TRANSACTIONS.  \u200b  INVESTMENT AND SECURITIES ADVISORY FEES AND COMMISSIONS INCREASED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED TRADING VOLUMES.  \u200b  OTHER NONINTEREST INCOME INCREASED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF $35.5 MILLION AND $59.9 MILLION RESPECTIVE INCREASES IN TRADING GAINS EARNED FROM OUR DERIVATIVE AND TRADING PORTFOLIO ACTIVITIES, MOST NOTABLY IN OUR STRUCTURED FINANCE BUSINESS, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR $32.5 MILLION AND $51.6 MILLION OF THE RESPECTIVE INCREASES, WHILE OUR CAPITAL MARKETS BUSINESS ACCOUNTED FOR $2.8 MILLION AND $8.2 MILLION OF THE RESPECTIVE INCREASES. THE $32.5 MILLION AND $51.6 MILLION INCREASES IN OUR STRUCTURED FINANCE BUSINESS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 41 AND 69 RESPECTIVE BASIS-POINT DECLINES IN THE 10-YEAR TREASURY BOND YIELD DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 11 AND 45 RESPECTIVE BASIS-POINT INCREASES DURING THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, AND 25% AND 18% RESPECTIVE INCREASES IN THE TBA MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES VOLUME. THE $2.8 MILLION AND $8.2 MILLION RESPECTIVE INCREASES IN OUR CAPITAL MARKETS BUSINESS IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN IMPROVED MARKET ENVIRONMENT, IMPROVED SPREADS AND 10% AND 17% RESPECTIVE INCREASES IN TRADING VOLUME.  \u200b  NONINTEREST EXPENSES INCREASED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND, WITH RESPECT TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE  67  TABLE OF CONTENTS  $2.2 MILLION IN PRE-TAX COSTS RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 ASSOCIATED WITH LEADERSHIP CHANGES AS NOTED IN THE \u201cFACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d SECTION ABOVE.  \u200b  SELECTED INFORMATION CONCERNING THE BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT FOLLOWS (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  \u200b  \u200b  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  \u200b  \u200b  2019  \u200b  2018  \u200b  2019  \u200b  2018  \u200b  TOTAL COMPENSATION AS A % OF NET REVENUE  \u200b  60.1%  \u200b  60.6%  \u200b  \u200b  60.3%  \u200b  62.5%  FDIC INSURED PROGRAM BALANCES AT THE BANK (END OF PERIOD)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  $1,304,744  \u200b  $1,278,694  \u200b  OTHER FDIC INSURED PROGRAM BALANCES (END OF PERIOD)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  $675,621  \u200b  $896,739  \u200b  CUSTOMER MARGIN BALANCES (END OF PERIOD)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  $336,729  \u200b  $355,561  \u200b  CUSTOMER FUNDS ON DEPOSIT, INCLUDING SHORT CREDITS (END OF PERIOD)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  $325,427  \u200b  $354,277  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  PUBLIC BANKING.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  NUMBER OF ISSUES  \u200b  350  \u200b  \u200b  368  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  563  \u200b  \u200b  604  \u200b  AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF OFFERINGS  $14,347,624  \u200b  $15,066,403  \u200b  \u200b  $26,139,362  \u200b  $25,715,524  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  CAPITAL MARKETS.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  TOTAL VOLUMES  $22,570,905  \u200b  $20,505,462  \u200b  \u200b  $42,602,822  \u200b  $36,376,727  \u200b  NET INVENTORY (END OF PERIOD)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  $553,586  \u200b  $376,388  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  RETAIL.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  RETAIL EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES (END OF PERIOD)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  124  \u200b  \u200b  124  \u200b  INDEPENDENT REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVES (END OF PERIOD)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  203  \u200b  \u200b  218  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  STRUCTURED FINANCE.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  LOCK PRODUCTION/TBA VOLUME  $1,650,597  \u200b  $1,318,084  \u200b  \u200b  $2,798,811  \u200b  $2,379,596  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  CLEARING.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  TOTAL TICKETS  \u200b  509,546  \u200b  \u200b  373,385  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  1,014,767  \u200b  \u200b  779,516  \u200b  CORRESPONDENTS (END OF PERIOD)  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  148  \u200b  \u200b  152  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  SECURITIES LENDING.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS -

HISTORICALLY, THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT HAS TYPICALLY EXPERIENCED INCREASED LOAN ORIGINATION VOLUME FROM PURCHASES OF HOMES DURING THE SPRING AND SUMMER, WHEN MORE PEOPLE TEND TO MOVE AND BUY OR SELL HOMES. AN INCREASE IN MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES TENDS TO RESULT IN DECREASED LOAN ORIGINATION VOLUME FROM REFINANCINGS, WHILE A DECREASE IN MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES TENDS TO RESULT IN INCREASED LOAN ORIGINATION VOLUME FROM REFINANCINGS. AS AVERAGE MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES HAVE DECREASED BETWEEN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 AND THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN 2019, REFINANCING VOLUME AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ORIGINATION VOLUME HAS INCREASED FROM 12.0% TO 15.9%. REFINANCING VOLUME AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL ORIGINATION VOLUME FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN 2018 WAS RELATIVELY FLAT AT APPROXIMATELY 16%. CHANGES IN MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD A LESSER IMPACT ON HOME PURCHASES VOLUME THAN ON REFINANCING VOLUME. WE ANTICIPATE THAT RECENT DECREASES IN MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES WILL INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF REFINANCING VOLUMES RELATIVE TO TOTAL LOAN ORIGINATION VOLUME FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  \u200b  THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT PRIMARILY ORIGINATES ITS MORTGAGE LOANS THROUGH A RETAIL CHANNEL, WITH LIMITED LENDING THROUGH ITS AFFILIATED BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS (\u201cABAS\u201d). FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, FUNDED VOLUME THROUGH ABAS WAS APPROXIMATELY 7% OF THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT\u2019S TOTAL LOAN VOLUME. CURRENTLY, PRIMELENDING OWNS A 51% MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN FOUR ABAS.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS INITIATIVE WAS TO BETTER ALIGN RESOURCES AND  70  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LOWER PRIMELENDING\u2019S COST STRUCTURE. THE DECREASES IN NON-VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS AND SEGMENT OPERATING COSTS DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THIS INITIATIVE. DECREASES IN NONINTEREST EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF THIS INITIATIVE HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COSTS RELATED TO THE \u201cTECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENTS AND CORPORATE INITIATIVES\u201d DISCUSSED IN DETAIL WITHIN THE \u201cOVERVIEW\u201d ABOVE.  \u200b  TOTAL EMPLOYEES\u2019 COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF NONINTEREST EXPENSES INCURRED DURING ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. SPECIFICALLY, VARIABLE COMPENSATION COMPRISED 61.5% AND 59.6% OF TOTAL EMPLOYEES\u2019 COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS EXPENSES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND 56.3% AND 55.6% DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. VARIABLE COMPENSATION, WHICH IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOAN ORIGINATION VOLUME, TENDS TO FLUCTUATE TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN LOAN ORIGINATION VOLUME BECAUSE MORTGAGE LOAN ORIGINATOR AND FULFILLMENT STAFF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS ARE STRUCTURED TO PAY AT INCREASING RATES AS HIGHER MONTHLY VOLUME TIERS ARE ACHIEVED. HOWEVER, CERTAIN OTHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS DRIVEN BY NON-MORTGAGE PRODUCTION CRITERIA MAY ALTER THIS TREND. THE DECREASES IN VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS BETWEEN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE INCENTIVE RATE PAID.  \u200b  WHILE TOTAL LOAN ORIGINATION VOLUME DECREASED 3.6% AND 9.3% FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, THE AGGREGATE NON-VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS AND SEGMENT OPERATING COSTS OF THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT DECREASED 8.1% AND 8.9%, RESPECTIVELY. THE AFOREMENTIONED DECREASES DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN NON-VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, IN ADDITION TO DECREASES IN OCCUPANCY AND ADVERTISING COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN SOFTWARE LICENSE AND MAINTENANCE FEES. IN ADDITION, DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE RELATIVELY FLAT, WHILE DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, PROFESSIONAL FEES DECREASED. THE DECREASES IN NON-VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS AND OCCUPANCY COSTS DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WERE DUE TO A REDUCTION IN FULFILLMENT AND CORPORATE STAFF AND THE CLOSURE OF CERTAIN UNDERPERFORMING BRANCHES PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM PRIMELENDING\u2019S COST REDUCTION INITIATIVE DISCUSSED ABOVE AND IMPLEMENTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.  \u200b  IN EXCHANGE FOR A HIGHER INTEREST RATE, CUSTOMERS MAY OPT TO HAVE PRIMELENDING PAY CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ORIGINATION OF THEIR MORTGAGE LOANS (\u201cLENDER PAID CLOSING COSTS\u201d). FLUCTUATIONS IN LENDER PAID CLOSING COSTS ARE NOT ALWAYS ALIGNED WITH FLUCTUATIONS IN LOAN ORIGINATION VOLUME. OTHER LOAN PRICING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE MORTGAGE LOAN INTEREST RATE, LOAN ORIGINATION FEES PAID BY THE CUSTOMER, AND A CUSTOMER\u2019S WILLINGNESS TO PAY CLOSING COSTS, MAY INFLUENCE FLUCTUATIONS IN LENDER PAID CLOSING COSTS.  \u200b  BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2010 AND JUNE 30, 2019, THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT SOLD MORTGAGE LOANS TOTALING $113.7 BILLION. THESE LOANS WERE SOLD UNDER SALES CONTRACTS THAT GENERALLY INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT HOLD THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT RESPONSIBLE FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS RELATING TO ITS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES THAT LOANS SOLD MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING REPRESENTATIONS AS TO UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND THE VALIDITY OF CERTAIN BORROWER REPRESENTATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN. IN ADDITION, THE SALES CONTRACTS TYPICALLY REQUIRE THE REFUND OF PURCHASED SERVICING RIGHTS PLUS CERTAIN INVESTOR SERVICING COSTS IF A LOAN EXPERIENCES AN EARLY PAYMENT DEFAULT. WHILE THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT SOLD LOANS PRIOR TO 2010, IT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN THE FUTURE ON LOANS ORIGINATED PRIOR TO 2010 AS A RESULT OF INVESTOR CLAIMS UNDER THESE PROVISIONS OF ITS SALES CONTRACTS.  \u200b  WHEN A CLAIM FOR INDEMNIFICATION OF A LOAN SOLD IS MADE BY AN AGENCY, INVESTOR, OR OTHER PARTY, THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT EVALUATES THE CLAIM AND DETERMINES IF THE CLAIM CAN BE SATISFIED THROUGH ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER DELIVERABLES. IF THE CLAIM IS VALID AND CANNOT BE SATISFIED IN THAT MANNER, THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT NEGOTIATES WITH THE CLAIMANT TO REACH A SETTLEMENT OF THE CLAIM. SETTLEMENTS TYPICALLY RESULT IN EITHER THE REPURCHASE OF A LOAN OR REIMBURSEMENT TO THE CLAIMANT FOR LOSSES INCURRED ON THE LOAN.  \u200b  71  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT\u2019S CLAIMS RESOLUTION ACTIVITY RELATING TO LOANS SOLD BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2010 AND JUNE 30, 2019 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  ORIGINAL  LOAN  BALANCE  \u200b  LOSS  RECOGNIZED  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b% OF  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b% OF  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  LOANS  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  LOANS  \u200b  \u200b  AMOUNT  SOLD  AMOUNT  SOLD  CLAIMS RESOLVED WITH NO PAYMENT  \u200b  $207,260  \u200b  0.18%  \u200b  $\u2014  \u200b  0.00%  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  CLAIMS RESOLVED BECAUSE OF A LOAN REPURCHASE OR PAYMENT TO AN INVESTOR FOR LOSSES INCURRED (1)  \u200b  \u200b  199,918  \u200b  0.18%  \u200b  \u200b  9,380  \u200b  0.01%  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  $407,178  \u200b  0.36%  \u200b  $9,380  \u200b  0.01%  \u200b  (1)  LOSSES INCURRED INCLUDE REFUNDED PURCHASED SERVICING RIGHTS.  \u200b  FOR EACH LOAN IT CONCLUDES ITS OBLIGATION TO A CLAIMANT IS BOTH PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, THE MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT HAS ESTABLISHED A SPECIFIC CLAIMS INDEMNIFICATION LIABILITY RESERVE.

THE INCREASE IN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A LARGER INCREASE IN THE FAIR VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE EQUITY SECURITIES HELD BY THE INSURANCE SEGMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN NET INSURANCE PREMIUMS EARNED, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF THE FACTORS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED.  \u200b  THE INSURANCE SEGMENT IS SUBJECT TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF SEVERE WEATHER, THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF WHICH ARE INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE. GENERALLY, THE INSURANCE SEGMENT\u2019S INSURED RISKS EXHIBIT HIGHER LOSSES IN THE SECOND AND THIRD CALENDAR QUARTERS DUE TO A SEASONAL CONCENTRATION OF WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS IN ITS PRIMARY GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS. ALTHOUGH WEATHER-RELATED LOSSES (INCLUDING HAIL, HIGH WINDS, TORNADOES, MONSOONS AND HURRICANES) CAN OCCUR IN ANY CALENDAR QUARTER, THE SECOND CALENDAR QUARTER, HISTORICALLY, HAS EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST FREQUENCY OF LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EVENTS. HURRICANES, HOWEVER, ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE THIRD CALENDAR QUARTER OF THE YEAR.  \u200b  THE INSURANCE SEGMENT PERIODICALLY REVIEWS THE PRICING OF ITS PRIMARY PRODUCTS IN EACH STATE OF OPERATION UTILIZING A CONSULTING ACTUARIAL FIRM TO SUPPLEMENT NORMAL REVIEW PROCESSES RESULTING IN FILINGS TO ADJUST RATES AS DEEMED NECESSARY. THE BENEFIT OF THESE RATE ACTIONS ARE NOT FULLY REALIZED UNTIL ALL POLICIES UNDER THE OLD RATES EXPIRE, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF RATE CHANGE IMPLEMENTATION. CONCURRENTLY, BUSINESS CONCENTRATIONS ARE REVIEWED AND ACTIONS INITIATED, INCLUDING CANCELLATION OF AGENTS, NON-RENEWAL OF POLICIES AND CESSATION OF NEW BUSINESS WRITING ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS IN PROBLEMATIC GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. THE INSURANCE SEGMENT HAS HISTORICALLY UTILIZED RATE ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE RATE OF PREMIUM GROWTH FOR TARGETED AREAS WHEN COMPARED WITH THE PATTERNS EXHIBITED IN PRIOR QUARTERS AND YEARS AND REDUCED THE INSURANCE SEGMENT\u2019S EXPOSURE TO VOLATILE WEATHER IN THESE AREAS, BUT COMPETITION AND CUSTOMER RESPONSE TO  72  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RATE INCREASES HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED CUSTOMER RETENTION AND NEW BUSINESS. THE INSURANCE SEGMENT AIMS TO MANAGE AND DIVERSIFY ITS BUSINESS CONCENTRATIONS AND PRODUCTS TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF FUTURE WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT CURRENT INITIATIVES TO EVALUATE PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND PRICING, STREAMLINE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND EXPENSES AND MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF FUTURE SIGNIFICANT WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS ARE CRITICAL TO IMPROVING THE INSURANCE SEGMENT\u2019S LONG-TERM FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.  \u200b  THE INSURANCE SEGMENT\u2019S OPERATIONS RESULTED IN COMBINED RATIOS OF 113.0% AND 111.1% DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND 99.8% AND 98.1% DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASES IN THE COMBINED RATIOS DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN THE LOSS AND LAE RATIO. THE COMBINED RATIO IS A MEASURE OF OVERALL INSURANCE UNDERWRITING PROFITABILITY, AND REPRESENTS THE SUM OF LOSS AND LAE AND UNDERWRITING EXPENSES DIVIDED BY NET INSURANCE PREMIUMS EARNED.  \u200b  NONINTEREST INCOME DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF NET INSURANCE PREMIUMS EARNED OF $33.5 MILLION AND $34.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. NONINTEREST INCOME DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF NET INSURANCE PREMIUMS EARNED OF $66.7 MILLION AND $68.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE DECREASE IN TOTAL DIRECT INSURANCE PREMIUMS WRITTEN DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, WAS DUE TO COMPETITION, RATIONALIZATION OF PRODUCT OFFERINGS, INCLUDING THE NON-RENEWAL OF COMMERCIAL POLICIES, AND CONTINUED REVIEW OF GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, IN CONNECTION WITH A STRATEGIC INITIATIVE TO FOCUS ON OUR INSURANCE SEGMENT\u2019S KEY MARKETS, WE DISCONTINUED WRITING NEW INSURANCE POLICIES IN FIVE NON-CORE STATES.

IN ADDITION, THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS USED TO MEET COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC AND TRUST DEPOSITS, SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE AND OTHER PURPOSES. THE AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND EQUITY SECURITIES PORTFOLIOS SERVE AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. HISTORICALLY, THE BANK\u2019S POLICY HAS BEEN TO INVEST PRIMARILY IN SECURITIES OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND ITS AGENCIES, OBLIGATIONS OF MUNICIPALITIES IN THE STATE OF TEXAS AND OTHER HIGH GRADE FIXED INCOME SECURITIES TO MINIMIZE CREDIT RISK. AT JUNE 30, 2019, THE BANKING SEGMENT\u2019S SECURITIES PORTFOLIO OF $1.3 BILLION WAS COMPRISED OF TRADING SECURITIES OF $2.5 MILLION, AVAILABLE FOR SALE SECURITIES OF $916.5 MILLION, EQUITY SECURITIES OF $0.1 MILLION AND HELD TO MATURITY SECURITIES OF $365.9 MILLION, IN ADDITION TO $13.3 MILLION OF OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  \u200b  BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT  \u200b  THE BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT HOLDS SECURITIES TO SUPPORT SALES, UNDERWRITING AND OTHER CUSTOMER ACTIVITIES.

THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS ARE REQUIRED TO CARRY THEIR SECURITIES AT FAIR VALUE AND RECORD CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO IN OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO OF THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS INCLUDED TRADING SECURITIES OF $599.0 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2019. IN ADDITION, THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS THAT REPRESENT COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE AND DELIVER SECURITIES AT PREVAILING FUTURE MARKET PRICES TO FACILITATE CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS AND SATISFY SUCH COMMITMENTS.

THE NEW MODEL WILL REQUIRE THE MEASUREMENT OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES TO REFLECT THE LIFETIME OF AN EXPOSURE (OR POOL OF EXPOSURES) REPRESENTED BY CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO BE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT CONDITIONS AND REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE FORECASTS. UNDER THE CURRENT \u201cINCURRED LOSS\u201d MODEL, THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES IS BASED ONLY ON ESTIMATES OF LOAN LOSSES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST IN THE PORTFOLIO AS OF THE REPORTING DATE. THE NEW MODEL WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2020, AND APPLIES TO MOST DEBT INSTRUMENTS, TRADE RECEIVABLES, LEASE RECEIVABLES, REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES, FINANCIAL GUARANTEES AND LOAN COMMITMENTS. OUR ONGOING CECL TRANSITION EFFORTS INCLUDE REASSESSING RISK RATINGS, DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING THE NEW MODEL, COLLECTING AND PROCESSING NEW DATA AND ESTABLISHING INTERNAL CONTROLS AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES. NEW MODEL DEVELOPMENT HAS INCREASED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF DATA, AND THESE INCREASES IN EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS WE PERFORM PARALLEL CALCULATIONS OF OUR ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES UNDER BOTH THE CURRENT ALLOWANCE MODEL AND UNDER THE CECL MODEL. WE EXPECT THAT THE CECL MODEL WILL REQUIRE A MATERIAL INCREASE IN OUR ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES UPON ADOPTION ON JANUARY 1, 2020.  \u200b  INSURANCE LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES  \u200b  AT JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, OUR GROSS RESERVE FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE WAS $22.3 MILLION AND $20.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING ESTIMATED RECOVERIES FROM REINSURANCE OF $1.2 MILLION AND $3.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE LIABILITY FOR INSURANCE LOSSES AND LAE REPRESENTS ESTIMATES OF THE ULTIMATE UNPAID COST OF ALL LOSSES INCURRED, INCLUDING LOSSES FOR CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN REPORTED, LESS A REDUCTION FOR REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES RELATED TO THOSE LIABILITIES. SEPARATELY FOR EACH OF NLIC AND ASIC AND EACH LINE OF BUSINESS, OUR ACTUARIES ESTIMATE THE LIABILITY FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE BY FIRST ESTIMATING ULTIMATE LOSSES AND LAE AMOUNTS FOR EACH YEAR, PRIOR TO RECOGNIZING THE IMPACT OF REINSURANCE. THE AMOUNT OF LIABILITIES FOR REPORTED CLAIMS IS BASED PRIMARILY ON A CLAIM-BY-CLAIM EVALUATION OF COVERAGE, LIABILITY, INJURY SEVERITY OR SCOPE OF PROPERTY DAMAGE, AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION CONSIDERED RELEVANT TO ESTIMATING EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY THE CLAIM.  \u200b  NLC\u2019S LIABILITIES FOR UNPAID LOSSES REPRESENT THE BEST ESTIMATE AT A GIVEN POINT IN TIME OF WHAT IT EXPECTS TO PAY CLAIMANTS, BASED ON FACTS, CIRCUMSTANCES AND HISTORICAL TRENDS THEN KNOWN. DURING THE LOSS SETTLEMENT PERIOD, ADDITIONAL FACTS REGARDING INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS MAY BECOME KNOWN AND, CONSEQUENTLY, IT OFTEN BECOMES NECESSARY TO REFINE AND ADJUST THE ESTIMATES OF LIABILITY. THIS PROCESS IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS LOSS DEVELOPMENT. TO PROJECT ULTIMATE LOSSES AND LAE, OUR ACTUARIES EXAMINE THE PAID AND REPORTED LOSSES AND LAE FOR EACH ACCIDENT YEAR AND MULTIPLY THESE VALUES BY A LOSS DEVELOPMENT FACTOR. THE SELECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FACTORS ARE BASED UPON A REVIEW OF THE LOSS DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS INDICATED IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 HISTORICAL LOSS TRIANGLES (WHICH UTILIZE HISTORICAL TRENDS, ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN LOSS COSTS, UNDERWRITING STANDARDS, POLICY PROVISIONS, PRODUCT MIX AND OTHER FACTORS) AND APPLICABLE INSURANCE INDUSTRY LOSS DEVELOPMENT FACTORS. ESTIMATING THE LIABILITY FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE IS INHERENTLY JUDGMENTAL AND IS INFLUENCED BY FACTORS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VARIATION. LIABILITIES FOR LAE ARE INTENDED TO COVER THE ULTIMATE COST OF SETTLING CLAIMS, INCLUDING INVESTIGATION AND DEFENSE OF LAWSUITS RESULTING FROM SUCH CLAIMS.  \u200b  THE RESERVE ANALYSIS PERFORMED BY OUR ACTUARIES PROVIDES PRELIMINARY CENTRAL ESTIMATES OF THE UNPAID LOSSES AND LAE. AT EACH QUARTER-END, THE RESULTS OF THE RESERVE ANALYSIS ARE SUMMARIZED AND DISCUSSED WITH OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT. THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT GROUP CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF RESERVES TO RECORD FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE THE EXTENT AND TIMING OF ANY RECENT CATASTROPHIC EVENTS, HISTORICAL PATTERN AND VOLATILITY OF THE ACTUARIAL INDICATIONS, THE SENSITIVITY OF THE ACTUARIAL INDICATIONS TO CHANGES IN PAID AND REPORTED LOSS PATTERNS, THE CONSISTENCY OF CLAIMS HANDLING PROCESSES, THE CONSISTENCY OF CASE RESERVING PRACTICES, CHANGES IN OUR PRICING AND UNDERWRITING, AND OVERALL PRICING AND UNDERWRITING TRENDS IN THE INSURANCE MARKET.  \u200b  DEPOSITS  \u200b  THE BANKING SEGMENT\u2019S MAJOR SOURCE OF FUNDS AND LIQUIDITY IS ITS DEPOSIT BASE. DEPOSITS PROVIDE FUNDING FOR ITS INVESTMENTS IN LOANS AND SECURITIES. INTEREST PAID FOR DEPOSITS MUST BE MANAGED CAREFULLY TO CONTROL THE LEVEL OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND OVERALL NET INTEREST MARGIN.

THE INCREASE IN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AT JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 2018, INCLUDED AN INCREASE IN BORROWINGS IN OUR BANKING SEGMENT PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASED UTILIZATION OF AVAILABLE INTERNAL FUNDS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET DECREASE IN SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE AND SHORT-TERM BANK LOANS USED BY THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS TO FINANCE THEIR ACTIVITIES. NOTES PAYABLE AT JUNE 30, 2019, WAS COMPRISED OF $148.7 MILLION RELATED TO THE SENIOR NOTES, NET OF LOAN ORIGINATION FEES, FHLB BORROWINGS WITH AN ORIGINAL MATURITY GREATER THAN ONE YEAR WITHIN THE BANKING SEGMENT OF $4.0 MILLION, INSURANCE SEGMENT TERM NOTES OF $27.5 MILLION, AND MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT BORROWINGS OF $51.7 MILLION.  \u200b  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  \u200b  HILLTOP IS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY WHOSE ASSETS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF THE STOCK OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND INVESTED ASSETS. HILLTOP\u2019S PRIMARY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, AS A HOLDING COMPANY, ARE TO SUPPORT CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT FOR ORGANIC GROWTH AND TO PRESERVE CAPITAL TO BE DEPLOYED THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND POTENTIAL STOCK REPURCHASES. AT JUNE 30, 2019, HILLTOP HAD $67.0 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, AN INCREASE OF $23.1 MILLION FROM $43.9 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. THIS INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $71.3 MILLION OF DIVIDENDS FROM SUBSIDIARIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $25.0 MILLION OF PURCHASES UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, $15.0 MILLION IN CASH DIVIDENDS DECLARED, AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES. SUBJECT TO REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS, HILLTOP HAS RECEIVED, AND MAY ALSO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE, DIVIDENDS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES. IF NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE, WE MAY ALSO FINANCE ACQUISITIONS WITH THE PROCEEDS FROM EQUITY OR DEBT ISSUANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT HILLTOP\u2019S LIQUIDITY IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, WITH CURRENT SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS INCLUDING OPERATING EXPENSES, INTEREST ON DEBT OBLIGATIONS, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO STOCKHOLDERS AND POTENTIAL STOCK REPURCHASES.  \u200b  DIVIDEND DECLARATION  \u200b  ON JULY 25, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.08 PER COMMON SHARE, PAYABLE ON AUGUST 30, 2019 TO ALL COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON AUGUST 15, 2019.  \u200b  FUTURE DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK ARE SUBJECT TO THE DETERMINATION BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF OUR EARNINGS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES, THE GENERAL ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY CLIMATE, OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE ANY EQUITY OR DEBT OBLIGATIONS SENIOR TO OUR COMMON STOCK AND OTHER FACTORS.  82  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u200b  STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM  \u200b  IN JANUARY 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM THROUGH JANUARY 2020, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE ARE AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE, IN THE AGGREGATE, UP TO $50.0 MILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, INCLUSIVE OF REPURCHASES TO OFFSET DILUTION RELATED TO GRANTS OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED, WE MAY REPURCHASE SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS AS PERMITTED UNDER RULE 10B-18 PROMULGATED UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT. THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE REPURCHASE OUR SHARES AND THE TIMING OF SUCH REPURCHASES DEPENDS UPON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER CORPORATE CONSIDERATIONS, AS DETERMINED BY HILLTOP\u2019S MANAGEMENT TEAM. REPURCHASED SHARES WILL BE RETURNED TO OUR POOL OF AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.  \u200b  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE PAID $25.0 MILLION TO REPURCHASE AN AGGREGATE OF 1,214,843 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $20.54 PER SHARE. THE PURCHASES WERE FUNDED FROM AVAILABLE CASH BALANCES.  \u200b  SENIOR NOTES DUE 2025  \u200b  THE SENIOR NOTES BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE OF 5% PER YEAR, PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS IN CASH ON APRIL 15 AND OCTOBER 15 OF EACH YEAR, COMMENCING ON OCTOBER 15, 2015. THE SENIOR NOTES WILL MATURE ON APRIL 15, 2025, UNLESS WE REDEEM THE SENIOR NOTES, IN WHOLE AT ANY TIME OR IN PART FROM TIME TO TIME, ON OR AFTER JANUARY 15, 2025 (THREE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE MATURITY DATE OF THE SENIOR NOTES) AT OUR ELECTION AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE SENIOR NOTES TO BE REDEEMED PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST TO, BUT EXCLUDING, THE REDEMPTION DATE. AT JUNE 30, 2019, $150.0 MILLION OF OUR SENIOR NOTES WAS OUTSTANDING.  \u200b  JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES  \u200b  THE DEBENTURES HAVE A STATED TERM OF 30 YEARS WITH MATURITIES RANGING FROM JULY 2031 TO FEBRUARY 2038 WITH INTEREST PAYABLE QUARTERLY. THE RATE ON THE DEBENTURES, WHICH RESETS QUARTERLY, IS 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS AN AVERAGE SPREAD OF 3.22%. THE TOTAL AVERAGE INTEREST RATE AT JUNE 30, 2019 WAS 5.66%. THE DEBENTURES ARE CALLABLE AT PCC\u2019S DISCRETION WITH A MINIMUM OF A 45- TO 60- DAY NOTICE. AT JUNE 30, 2019, $67.0 MILLION OF PCC\u2019S DEBENTURES WERE OUTSTANDING.  \u200b  REGULATORY CAPITAL  \u200b  WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED BY THE FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES. FAILURE TO MEET MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MAY PROMPT CERTAIN ACTIONS BY REGULATORS THAT, IF UNDERTAKEN, COULD HAVE A DIRECT MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. UNDER CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, WE MUST MEET SPECIFIC CAPITAL GUIDELINES THAT INVOLVE QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF OUR ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS AS CALCULATED UNDER REGULATORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. OUR CAPITAL AMOUNTS AND CLASSIFICATION ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO QUALITATIVE JUDGMENTS BY THE REGULATORS ABOUT COMPONENTS, RISK WEIGHTINGS AND OTHER FACTORS.  \u200b  IN ORDER TO AVOID LIMITATIONS ON CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS, INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, STOCK REPURCHASES AND CERTAIN DISCRETIONARY BONUS PAYMENTS TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, BASEL III REQUIRES BANKING ORGANIZATIONS TO MAINTAIN A CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER ABOVE MINIMUM RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MEASURED RELATIVE TO RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. THE PHASE-IN OF THE CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER REQUIREMENTS BEGAN ON JANUARY 1, 2016 FOR HILLTOP AND PLAINSCAPITAL, AND THE REQUIREMENTS WERE FULLY PHASED IN AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019.  \u200b  BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH LESS THAN $15 BILLION IN ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 ARE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO INCLUDE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES IN TIER 1 CAPITAL, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS. HOWEVER, IF AN INSTITUTION GROWS TO ABOVE $15 BILLION IN ASSETS AS A RESULT OF AN ACQUISITION, OR ORGANICALLY GROWS TO ABOVE $15 BILLION IN ASSETS AND THEN MAKES AN ACQUISITION, THE COMBINED TRUST PREFERRED ISSUANCES MUST BE PHASED OUT OF TIER 1 AND INTO TIER 2 CAPITAL. ALL OF THE DEBENTURES ISSUED TO THE PCC STATUTORY TRUSTS I, II, III AND IV (THE \u201cTRUSTS\u201d), LESS THE COMMON STOCK OF THE TRUSTS, QUALIFIED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, UNDER GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM.  \u200b  AT JUNE 30, 2019, HILLTOP HAD A TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS RATIO OF 17.14%, TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS RATIO OF 16.77%, COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS RATIO OF 16.32% AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AVERAGE ASSETS, OR LEVERAGE, RATIO OF 13.00%. ACCORDINGLY, HILLTOP\u2019S ACTUAL CAPITAL AMOUNTS AND RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH BASEL III EXCEEDED THE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING CONSERVATION BUFFER IN EFFECT AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.  83  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u200b  AT JUNE 30, 2019, PLAINSCAPITAL HAD A TOTAL CAPITAL TO RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS RATIO OF 14.48%, TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS RATIO OF 13.84%, COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL TO RISK WEIGHTED ASSETS RATIO OF 13.84% AND A TIER 1 CAPITAL TO AVERAGE ASSETS, OR LEVERAGE, RATIO OF 12.53%. ACCORDINGLY, PLAINSCAPITAL\u2019S ACTUAL CAPITAL AMOUNTS AND RATIOS IN ACCORDANCE WITH BASEL III RESULTED IN IT BEING CONSIDERED \u201cWELL-CAPITALIZED\u201d AND EXCEEDED THE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING CONSERVATION BUFFER IN EFFECT AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.  \u200b  WE DISCUSS REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 16 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS UNDER THE CAPTION \u201cGOVERNMENT SUPERVISION AND REGULATION \u2014 CORPORATE \u2014 CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS AND BASEL III\u201d SET FORTH IN PART I, ITEM I. OF OUR 2018 FORM 10-K.  \u200b  BANKING SEGMENT  \u200b  WITHIN OUR BANKING SEGMENT, OUR PRIMARY USES OF CASH ARE FOR CUSTOMER WITHDRAWALS AND EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT AS WELL AS OUR BORROWING COSTS AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. OUR ASSET AND LIABILITY GROUP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTINUOUSLY MONITORING OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION TO ENSURE THAT OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MANAGED IN A MANNER THAT WILL MEET OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS. OUR GOAL IS TO MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION IN A MANNER SUCH THAT WE CAN MEET OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEPOSIT WITHDRAWALS AND ANTICIPATED AND UNANTICIPATED INCREASES IN LOAN DEMAND WITHOUT PENALIZING EARNINGS. FUNDS INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE INSTRUMENTS, THE CONTINUOUS MATURING OF OTHER INTEREST-EARNING ASSETS, CASH FLOWS FROM SELF-LIQUIDATING INVESTMENTS SUCH AS MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS, THE POSSIBLE SALE OF AVAILABLE FOR SALE SECURITIES AND THE ABILITY TO SECURITIZE CERTAIN TYPES OF LOANS PROVIDE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY FROM AN ASSET PERSPECTIVE. THE LIABILITY BASE PROVIDES SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY THROUGH DEPOSITS AND THE MATURITY STRUCTURE OF SHORT-TERM BORROWED FUNDS. FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS, WE UTILIZE FEDERAL FUND LINES OF CREDIT WITH CORRESPONDENT BANKS, SECURITIES SOLD UNDER AGREEMENTS TO REPURCHASE, BORROWINGS FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND BORROWINGS UNDER LINES OF CREDIT WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FOR INTERMEDIATE LIQUIDITY NEEDS, WE UTILIZE ADVANCES FROM THE FHLB. TO SUPPLY LIQUIDITY OVER THE LONGER TERM, WE HAVE ACCESS TO BROKERED TIME DEPOSITS, TERM LOANS AT THE FHLB AND BORROWINGS UNDER LINES OF CREDIT WITH OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  \u200b  WITHIN OUR BANKING SEGMENT, DEPOSIT FLOWS ARE AFFECTED BY THE LEVEL OF MARKET INTEREST RATES, THE INTEREST RATES AND PRODUCTS OFFERED BY COMPETITORS, THE VOLATILITY OF EQUITY MARKETS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE BANK REGULARLY EVALUATES ITS DEPOSIT PRODUCTS AND PRICING STRUCTURES RELATIVE TO THE MARKET TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVENESS OVER TIME.  \u200b  THE BANK\u2019S 15 LARGEST DEPOSITORS, EXCLUDING HILLTOP AND HILLTOP SECURITIES, ACCOUNTED FOR 8.21% OF THE BANK\u2019S TOTAL DEPOSITS, AND THE BANK\u2019S FIVE LARGEST DEPOSITORS, EXCLUDING HILLTOP AND HILLTOP SECURITIES, ACCOUNTED FOR 4.37% OF THE BANK\u2019S TOTAL DEPOSITS AT JUNE 30, 2019. THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR LARGEST BANK CUSTOMERS, OR A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN OUR DEPOSIT BALANCES DUE TO ORDINARY COURSE FLUCTUATIONS RELATED TO THESE CUSTOMERS\u2019 BUSINESSES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND MIGHT REQUIRE US TO RAISE DEPOSIT RATES TO ATTRACT NEW DEPOSITS, PURCHASE FEDERAL FUNDS OR BORROW FUNDS ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS TO REPLACE SUCH DEPOSITS.  \u200b  BROKER-DEALER SEGMENT  \u200b  THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS RELY ON THEIR EQUITY CAPITAL, SHORT-TERM BANK BORROWINGS, INTEREST-BEARING AND NON-INTEREST-BEARING CLIENT CREDIT BALANCES, CORRESPONDENT DEPOSITS, SECURITIES LENDING ARRANGEMENTS, REPURCHASE AGREEMENT FINANCINGS AND OTHER PAYABLES TO FINANCE THEIR ASSETS AND OPERATIONS, SUBJECT TO THEIR RESPECTIVE COMPLIANCE WITH BROKER-DEALER NET CAPITAL AND CUSTOMER PROTECTION RULES. AT JUNE 30, 2019, HILLTOP SECURITIES HAD CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS WITH FIVE UNAFFILIATED BANKS WITH MAXIMUM AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS OF UP TO $725.0 MILLION. THESE CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS ARE USED TO FINANCE SECURITIES OWNED, SECURITIES HELD FOR CORRESPONDENT ACCOUNTS, RECEIVABLES IN CUSTOMER MARGIN ACCOUNTS AND UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES. THESE CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS ARE PROVIDED ON AN \u201cAS OFFERED\u201d BASIS AND ARE NOT COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT. IN ADDITION, HILLTOP SECURITIES HAS A COMMITTED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH AN UNAFFILIATED BANK OF UP TO $50.0 MILLION. AT JUNE 30, 2019, HILLTOP SECURITIES HAD BORROWED $231.0 MILLION UNDER ITS CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AND HAD NO BORROWINGS UNDER ITS CREDIT FACILITY.  \u200b  MORTGAGE ORIGINATION SEGMENT  \u200b  PRIMELENDING FUNDS THE MORTGAGE LOANS IT ORIGINATES THROUGH WAREHOUSE LINES OF CREDIT MAINTAINED WITH THE BANK WHICH HAVE AN AGGREGATE COMMITMENT OF $2.0 BILLION, OF WHICH $1.4 BILLION WAS DRAWN AT JUNE 30, 2019. PRIMELENDING SELLS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL MORTGAGE LOANS IT ORIGINATES TO VARIOUS INVESTORS IN THE SECONDARY MARKET, THE MAJORITY WITH SERVICING  84  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RELEASED. AS THESE MORTGAGE LOANS ARE SOLD IN THE SECONDARY MARKET, PRIMELENDING PAYS DOWN ITS WAREHOUSE LINE OF CREDIT WITH THE BANK. IN ADDITION, PRIMELENDING HAS AN AVAILABLE LINE OF CREDIT WITH AN UNAFFILIATED BANK OF UP TO $1.0 MILLION, OF WHICH NO BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING AT JUNE 30, 2019.  \u200b  PRIMELENDING OWNS A 100% MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN PRIMELENDING VENTURES MANAGEMENT, LLC (\u201cVENTURES MANAGEMENT\u201d) WHICH HOLDS AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN AND IS THE MANAGING MEMBER OF CERTAIN ABAS. AT JUNE 30, 2019, THESE ABAS HAD COMBINED AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT TOTALING $120.0 MILLION, $70.0 MILLION OF WHICH WAS WITH A SINGLE UNAFFILIATED BANK, AND THE REMAINING $50.0 MILLION OF WHICH WAS WITH THE BANK. AT JUNE 30, 2019, VENTURES MANAGEMENT HAD OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OF $64.4 MILLION, $12.7 MILLION OF WHICH WAS WITH THE BANK. IN JULY 2019, VENTURES MANAGEMENT ENTERED INTO AN ADDITIONAL $30.0 MILLION LINE OF CREDIT WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED UNAFFILIATED BANK.  \u200b  INSURANCE SEGMENT  \u200b  OUR INSURANCE OPERATING SUBSIDIARY\u2019S PRIMARY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES ARE TO PRESERVE CAPITAL AND MANAGE FOR A TOTAL RATE OF RETURN. NLC\u2019S STRATEGY IS TO PURCHASE SECURITIES IN SECTORS THAT REPRESENT THE MOST ATTRACTIVE RELATIVE VALUE. BONDS, CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF $130.6 MILLION, OR 83.8%, EQUITY INVESTMENTS OF $19.4 MILLION AND OTHER INVESTMENTS OF $5.9 MILLION COMPRISED NLC\u2019S $155.9 MILLION IN TOTAL CASH AND INVESTMENTS AT JUNE 30, 2019. NLC DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION IN BOTH DIRECT AND INDIRECT GUARANTOR EXPOSURE OR ANY INVESTMENTS IN SUBPRIME MORTGAGES. NLC HAS CUSTODIAL AGREEMENTS WITH AN UNAFFILIATED BANK AND AN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH DTF HOLDINGS, LLC.  \u200b  IMPACT OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES  \u200b  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED HEREIN HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, WHICH PRESENTLY REQUIRE US TO MEASURE FINANCIAL POSITION AND OPERATING RESULTS PRIMARILY IN TERMS OF HISTORIC DOLLARS. CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE VALUE OF MONEY DUE TO INFLATION OR RECESSION ARE GENERALLY NOT CONSIDERED. THE PRIMARY EFFECT OF INFLATION ON OUR OPERATIONS IS REFLECTED IN INCREASED OPERATING COSTS. IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S OPINION, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AFFECT THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION TO A FAR GREATER DEGREE THAN CHANGES IN THE INFLATION RATE. WHILE INTEREST RATES ARE GREATLY INFLUENCED BY CHANGES IN THE INFLATION RATE, THEY DO NOT NECESSARILY CHANGE AT THE SAME RATE OR IN THE SAME MAGNITUDE AS THE INFLATION RATE. INTEREST RATES ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO MANY FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED RATE OF INFLATION, THE INFLUENCE OF GENERAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, ITS AGENCIES AND VARIOUS OTHER GOVERNMENTAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.  \u200b  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS; COMMITMENTS; GUARANTEES  \u200b  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ENTER INTO VARIOUS TRANSACTIONS, WHICH, IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WE ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE TRANSACTIONS INCLUDE COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT, WHICH INVOLVE, TO VARYING DEGREES, ELEMENTS OF CREDIT RISK AND INTEREST RATE RISK IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  \u200b  WE ENTER INTO CONTRACTUAL LOAN COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT, NORMALLY WITH FIXED EXPIRATION DATES OR TERMINATION CLAUSES, AT SPECIFIED RATES AND FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT ARE CONTINGENT UPON CUSTOMERS MAINTAINING SPECIFIC CREDIT STANDARDS UNTIL THE TIME OF LOAN FUNDING. WE MINIMIZE OUR EXPOSURE TO LOSS UNDER THESE COMMITMENTS BY SUBJECTING THEM TO CREDIT APPROVAL AND MONITORING PROCEDURES. WE ASSESS THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT AND HAVE RECORDED A LIABILITY RELATED TO SUCH CREDIT RISK IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u200b  STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE WRITTEN CONDITIONAL COMMITMENTS ISSUED BY US TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF A CUSTOMER TO A THIRD PARTY. IN THE EVENT THE CUSTOMER DOES NOT PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT WITH THE THIRD PARTY, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FUND THE COMMITMENT. THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE IS REPRESENTED BY THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THE COMMITMENT. IF THE COMMITMENT IS FUNDED, WE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO SEEK RECOVERY FROM THE CUSTOMER. OUR POLICIES GENERALLY REQUIRE THAT STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS CONTAIN SECURITY AND DEBT COVENANTS SIMILAR TO THOSE CONTAINED IN LOAN AGREEMENTS.  \u200b  IN THE AGGREGATE, THE BANK HAD OUTSTANDING UNUSED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT OF $2.3 BILLION AT JUNE 30, 2019 AND OUTSTANDING FINANCIAL AND PERFORMANCE STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT OF $92.4 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2019.  \u200b  85  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS EXECUTE, SETTLE AND FINANCE VARIOUS SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY EXPOSE THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS TO OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK IN THE EVENT THAT A CUSTOMER OR COUNTERPARTY DOES NOT FULFILL ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. EXAMPLES OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS INCLUDE THE SALE OF SECURITIES NOT YET PURCHASED BY CUSTOMERS OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS, USE OF DERIVATIVES TO SUPPORT CERTAIN NON-PROFIT HOUSING ORGANIZATION CLIENTS, CLEARING AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE HILLTOP BROKER-DEALERS AND VARIOUS CLEARINGHOUSES AND BROKER-DEALERS, SECURED FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS THAT INVOLVE PLEDGED SECURITIES, AND WHEN-ISSUED UNDERWRITING AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS.  \u200b  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  \u200b  OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO UNDERSTANDING OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH INVOLVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND COMPLEXITY IN MAKING CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST CRITICAL IN PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATE TO ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES, RESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LAE, GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MORTGAGE LOAN INDEMNIFICATION LIABILITY, MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS ASSET AND ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING. SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2018, THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS FURTHER DESCRIBED UNDER \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\u201d AND NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR 2018 FORM 10-K, EXCEPT THAT WE NO LONGER CONSIDER ESTIMATES RELATED TO THE FDIC INDEMNIFICATION ASSET TO BE A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY.  \u200b", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Hilltop Holdings Inc.", "CIK": 1265131, "Date": "2019-07-25T00:00:00", "Ticker": "HTH", "Name": "Hilltop Holdings Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 6022.0, "Business": "TX", "Incorporated": "MD", "IRS": 841477939.0, "key": "20190725HTH", "labelr1": 0.044464206313924254, "labelr2": 0.13333333333333838, "labelr3": 2.2192632046160674, "labelr4": -1.5197568389057812, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.6644484, "prof1": 0.33555153, "return1&2": 0.9982226174596116, "return1&2&3": 0.9760694302101752, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9909033121282628, "return2": 0.9986666666666666, "return1": 0.9995553579368608, "return3": 0.9778073679538394, "return4": 1.0151975683890575, "1_day_return": 0.04446420631392112, "cumulative_return1": 0.22945055179994864, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.08213433231666896, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.004697057682529363, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.002556314517107361, "indexx": 1388, "cumreturn1b": 0.9921356114021959, "cumreturndow": 1.0177766293494586, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0151481831912814}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1426, "level_0": 3156, "index": 88509, "text": "ITEM 2.

OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOCUSES ON, AND OUR PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF, TWO CATEGORIES OF AGENCY RMBS: (I) TRADITIONAL PASS-THROUGH AGENCY RMBS, SUCH AS MORTGAGE PASS-THROUGH  CERTIFICATES ISSUED BY FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC OR GINNIE MAE (THE \u201cGSES\u201d) AND COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (\u201cCMOS\u201d) ISSUED BY THE GSES (\u201cPT RMBS\u201d) AND (II) STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS, SUCH AS INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES (\u201cIOS\u201d), INVERSE  INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES (\u201cIIOS\u201d) AND PRINCIPAL ONLY SECURITIES (\u201cPOS\u201d), AMONG OTHER TYPES OF STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS. WE WERE FORMED BY BIMINI IN AUGUST 2010, COMMENCED OPERATIONS ON NOVEMBER 24, 2010 AND COMPLETED OUR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING  (\u201cIPO\u201d) ON FEBRUARY 20, 2013.  WE ARE EXTERNALLY MANAGED BY BIMINI ADVISORS, AN INVESTMENT ADVISER REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \u201cSEC\u201d).  OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVE IS TO PROVIDE ATTRACTIVE RISK-ADJUSTED TOTAL RETURNS OVER THE LONG TERM THROUGH A COMBINATION OF  CAPITAL APPRECIATION AND THE PAYMENT OF REGULAR MONTHLY DISTRIBUTIONS. WE INTEND TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE BY INVESTING IN AND STRATEGICALLY ALLOCATING CAPITAL BETWEEN THE TWO CATEGORIES OF AGENCY RMBS DESCRIBED ABOVE. WE SEEK TO GENERATE INCOME  FROM (I) THE NET INTEREST MARGIN ON OUR LEVERAGED PT RMBS PORTFOLIO AND THE LEVERAGED PORTION OF OUR STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS PORTFOLIO, AND (II) THE INTEREST INCOME WE GENERATE FROM THE UNLEVERAGED PORTION OF OUR STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS PORTFOLIO.  WE INTEND TO FUND OUR PT RMBS AND CERTAIN OF OUR STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS THROUGH SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS STRUCTURED AS REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. PT RMBS AND STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS TYPICALLY EXHIBIT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT SENSITIVITIES TO MOVEMENTS IN  INTEREST RATES. DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF ONE PORTFOLIO MAY BE OFFSET BY APPRECIATION IN THE OTHER. THE PERCENTAGE OF CAPITAL THAT WE ALLOCATE TO OUR TWO AGENCY RMBS ASSET CATEGORIES WILL VARY AND WILL BE ACTIVELY MANAGED IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN  THE LEVEL OF INCOME GENERATED BY THE COMBINED PORTFOLIOS, THE STABILITY OF THAT INCOME STREAM AND THE STABILITY OF THE VALUE OF THE COMBINED PORTFOLIOS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS STRATEGY WILL ENHANCE OUR LIQUIDITY, EARNINGS, BOOK VALUE STABILITY AND  ASSET SELECTION OPPORTUNITIES IN VARIOUS INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENTS.  WE OPERATE SO AS TO QUALIFY TO BE TAXED AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (\u201cREIT\u201d) UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986,  AS AMENDED (THE \u201cCODE\u201d).  WE GENERALLY WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CURRENTLY DISTRIBUTE ALL OF OUR REIT TAXABLE INCOME (AS DEFINED IN THE CODE) TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND MAINTAIN OUR REIT QUALIFICATION.  THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK TRADES ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE UNDER THE SYMBOL \u201cORC\u201d.  CAPITAL RAISING ACTIVITIES  ON AUGUST 2, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO AN EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT (THE \u201cAUGUST 2017 EQUITY DISTRIBUTION  AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH TWO SALES AGENTS PURSUANT TO WHICH WE MAY OFFER AND SELL, FROM TIME TO TIME, UP TO AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $125,000,000 OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE \u201cAT THE MARKET\u201d OFFERINGS AND PRIVATELY  NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THROUGH JUNE 30, 2019, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF 13,351,877 SHARES UNDER THE AUGUST 2017 EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT FOR AGGREGATE GROSS PROCEEDS OF $113.7 MILLION, AND NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $112.0 MILLION, NET OF  COMMISSIONS AND FEES. SUBSEQUENT TO JUNE 30, 2019, WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL 1,771,301 SHARES UNDER THE AUGUST 2017 EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT FOR AGGREGATE GROSS PROCEEDS OF $11.3 MILLION, AND NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $11.1 MILLION, NET OF  COMMISSIONS AND FEES.  23  STOCK REPURCHASE AGREEMENT  ON JULY 29, 2015, THE  COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO 2,000,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE TIMING, MANNER, PRICE AND AMOUNT OF ANY REPURCHASES IS DETERMINED BY THE COMPANY IN ITS DISCRETION AND IS SUBJECT TO ECONOMIC AND MARKET  CONDITIONS, STOCK PRICE, APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS.  THE AUTHORIZATION DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR AMOUNT OF COMMON STOCK AND THE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT THE COMPANY\u2019S  DISCRETION WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.  ON FEBRUARY 8, 2018, THE  BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN INCREASE IN THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 4,522,822 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK.  THIS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM HAS NO TERMINATION DATE.  FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM THROUGH JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED A TOTAL  OF 5,665,620 SHARES AT AN AGGREGATE COST OF APPROXIMATELY $40.3 MILLION, INCLUDING COMMISSIONS AND FEES, FOR A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF $7.11 PER SHARE.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 469,975  SHARES AT AN AGGREGATE COST OF APPROXIMATELY $3.0 MILLION, INCLUDING COMMISSIONS AND FEES, FOR A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF $6.43 PER SHARE. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE  30, 2019. THE REMAINING AUTHORIZATION UNDER THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 WAS 857,202 SHARES.  FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  A VARIETY OF INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS MAY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. THESE FACTORS  INCLUDE.  \u00b7  INTEREST RATE TRENDS;  \u00b7  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AGENCY RMBS YIELDS AND OUR FUNDING AND HEDGING COSTS;  \u00b7  COMPETITION FOR, AND SUPPLY OF, INVESTMENTS IN AGENCY RMBS;  \u00b7  ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE (THE \u201cFED\u201d), THE FEDERAL OPEN  MARKET COMMITTEE (THE \u201cFOMC\u201d) AND THE U.S. TREASURY;  \u00b7  PREPAYMENT RATES ON MORTGAGES UNDERLYING OUR AGENCY RMBS AND CREDIT TRENDS INSOFAR AS THEY AFFECT PREPAYMENT RATES; AND  \u00b7  OTHER MARKET DEVELOPMENTS.  IN ADDITION, A VARIETY OF FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS MAY ALSO IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL  CONDITION. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE.  \u00b7  OUR DEGREE OF LEVERAGE;  \u00b7  OUR ACCESS TO FUNDING AND BORROWING CAPACITY;  \u00b7  OUR BORROWING COSTS;  \u00b7  OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES;  \u00b7  THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS; AND  \u00b7  THE REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY AS A REIT AND THE REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY FOR A REGISTRATION EXEMPTION UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  DESCRIBED BELOW ARE THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE SIX AND THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO  THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE SIX AND THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  24  NET INCOME (LOSS) SUMMARY  NET INCOME FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS $14.1 MILLION, OR $0.28 PER SHARE. NET LOSS FOR THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 WAS $15.0 MILLION, OR $0.29 PER SHARE.  NET INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS $3.5 MILLION, OR $0.07 PER SHARE. NET INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 WAS $1.3 MILLION, OR $0.03 PER SHARE.  THE  COMPONENTS OF NET INCOME (LOSS) FOR THE SIX AND THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, ALONG WITH THE CHANGES IN THOSE COMPONENTS ARE PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW.

SECURITIES HELD UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ARE  RECORDED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE RECORDED AS UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES THROUGH THE STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE NOT DESIGNATED OUR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS HEDGE ACCOUNTING RELATIONSHIPS, BUT RATHER HOLD THEM FOR  ECONOMIC HEDGING PURPOSES. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE PRESENTED IN A SEPARATE LINE ITEM IN THE COMPANY\u2019S STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOT INCLUDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE.  AS SUCH, FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, INTEREST  EXPENSE AND COST OF FUNDS ARE NOT IMPACTED BY THE FLUCTUATION IN VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.  PRESENTING NET EARNINGS EXCLUDING REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS ALLOWS MANAGEMENT TO: (I) ISOLATE THE NET INTEREST INCOME  AND OTHER EXPENSES OF THE COMPANY OVER TIME, FREE OF ALL MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS AND (II) ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FUNDING AND HEDGING STRATEGIES ON OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION DECISIONS AND OUR ASSET ALLOCATION PERFORMANCE. OUR FUNDING AND  HEDGING STRATEGIES, CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND ASSET SELECTION ARE INTEGRAL TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY, AND THEREFORE CRITICAL TO THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENTATION OF OUR NET EARNINGS EXCLUDING REALIZED AND  UNREALIZED GAINS IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A MEANS OF COMPARING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO THOSE OF OUR PEERS WHO HAVE NOT ELECTED THE SAME ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. OUR PRESENTATION OF NET EARNINGS EXCLUDING REALIZED AND  UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY-TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES, WHO MAY USE DIFFERENT CALCULATIONS. AS A RESULT, NET EARNINGS EXCLUDING REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A  SUBSTITUTE FOR OUR GAAP NET INCOME (LOSS) AS A MEASURE OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR ANY MEASURE OF OUR LIQUIDITY UNDER GAAP.  THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS A RECONCILIATION OF OUR NET INCOME (LOSS) DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND NET  EARNINGS EXCLUDING REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS.  25  NET EARNINGS EXCLUDING REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)  PER SHARE  NET EARNINGS  NET EARNINGS  EXCLUDING  EXCLUDING  REALIZED AND  REALIZED AND  REALIZED AND  REALIZED AND  NET  UNREALIZED  UNREALIZED  NET  UNREALIZED  UNREALIZED  INCOME  GAINS AND  GAINS AND  INCOME  GAINS AND  GAINS AND  (GAAP)  LOSSES  (1)  LOSSES  (GAAP)  LOSSES  LOSSES  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  $3,533  $(7,670  )  $11,203  $0.07  $(0.15  )  $0.22  MARCH 31, 2019  10,597  (748  )  11,345  0.22  (0.02  )  0.24  DECEMBER 31, 2018  (26,397  )  (40,707  )  14,310  (0.52  )  (0.80  )  0.28  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  (2,959  )  (20,150  )  17,191  (0.06  )  (0.39  )  0.33  JUNE 30, 2018  1,347  (17,734  )  19,081  0.03  (0.34  )  0.37  MARCH 31, 2018  (16,377  )  (38,055  )  21,678  (0.31  )  (0.72  )  0.41  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30, 2019  $14,130  $(8,418  )  $22,548  $0.28  $(0.17  )  $0.45  JUNE 30, 2018  (15,030  )  (55,789  )  40,759  (0.29  )  (1.06  )  0.77  (1)  INCLUDES REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) ON RMBS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING NET INTEREST INCOME OR  EXPENSE ON INTEREST RATE SWAPS.  ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE AND ECONOMIC NET INTEREST INCOME  WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SPECIFICALLY EURODOLLAR AND TREASURY NOTE (\u201cT-NOTE\u201d) FUTURES CONTRACTS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS  AND SWAPTIONS, TO HEDGE A PORTION OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS IN A RISING RATE ENVIRONMENT.  WE HAVE NOT ELECTED TO DESIGNATE OUR DERIVATIVE HOLDINGS FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS  ARE PRESENTED IN A SEPARATE LINE ITEM IN OUR STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOT INCLUDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. AS SUCH, FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, INTEREST EXPENSE AND COST OF FUNDS ARE NOT IMPACTED BY THE FLUCTUATION IN VALUE OF THE  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.  FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPUTING ECONOMIC NET INTEREST INCOME AND RATIOS RELATING TO COST OF FUNDS MEASURES, GAAP INTEREST  EXPENSE HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THE COMPANY USES, SPECIFICALLY EURODOLLAR AND U.S. TREASURY FUTURES, AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND SWAPTIONS, THAT PERTAIN TO EACH  PERIOD PRESENTED. WE BELIEVE THAT ADJUSTING OUR INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED BY THE GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WOULD NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT OUR ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THESE PERIODS. THE REASON IS THAT  THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY COVER PERIODS THAT EXTEND INTO THE FUTURE, NOT JUST THE CURRENT PERIOD. ANY REALIZED OR UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE INSTRUMENTS REFLECT THE CHANGE IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENT CAUSED BY CHANGES IN  UNDERLYING INTEREST RATES APPLICABLE TO THE TERM COVERED BY THE INSTRUMENT, NOT JUST THE CURRENT PERIOD. FOR EACH PERIOD PRESENTED, WE HAVE COMBINED THE EFFECTS OF THE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN PLACE FOR THE RESPECTIVE PERIOD WITH THE  ACTUAL INTEREST EXPENSE INCURRED ON BORROWINGS TO REFLECT TOTAL ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE APPLICABLE PERIOD. INTEREST EXPENSE, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PERIOD, IS REFERRED TO AS ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE. NET  INTEREST INCOME, WHEN CALCULATED TO INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PERIOD, IS REFERRED TO AS ECONOMIC NET INTEREST INCOME. THIS PRESENTATION INCLUDES GAINS OR LOSSES ON ALL CONTRACTS IN EFFECT DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD,  COVERING THE CURRENT PERIOD AS WELL AS PERIODS IN THE FUTURE.  26  WE BELIEVE THAT ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE AND ECONOMIC NET INTEREST INCOME PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INFORMATION TO CONSIDER, IN  ADDITION TO THE RESPECTIVE AMOUNTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE NON-GAAP MEASURES HELP MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE ITS FINANCIAL POSITION AND PERFORMANCE WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND GAAP ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE NOT  NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OR OPERATIONS. THE UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PRESENTED IN OUR STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS ARE NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TOTAL INTEREST RATE EXPENSE  THAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY REALIZE. THIS IS BECAUSE AS INTEREST RATES MOVE UP OR DOWN IN THE FUTURE, THE GAINS OR LOSSES WE ULTIMATELY REALIZE, AND WHICH WILL AFFECT OUR TOTAL INTEREST RATE EXPENSE IN FUTURE PERIODS, MAY DIFFER FROM THE UNREALIZED  GAINS OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED AS OF THE REPORTING DATE.  OUR PRESENTATION OF THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGY HAS IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS. FIRST, OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS  MAY CALCULATE ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE AND ECONOMIC NET INTEREST INCOME DIFFERENTLY THAN THE WAY WE CALCULATE THEM. SECOND, WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THE CALCULATION OF THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGY DESCRIBED ABOVE HELPS TO PRESENT OUR  FINANCIAL POSITION AND PERFORMANCE, IT MAY BE OF LIMITED USEFULNESS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL. THEREFORE, THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED IN ISOLATION AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR INTEREST EXPENSE AND NET INTEREST  INCOME COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE TABLES BELOW PRESENT A RECONCILIATION OF THE ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST EXPENSE SHOWN FOR EACH PERIOD RELATIVE TO OUR  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, AND THE INCOME STATEMENT LINE ITEM, GAINS (LOSSES) ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP FOR EACH QUARTER OF 2019 TO DATE AND 2018.

(3)  CALCULATED BY ADDING THE EFFECT OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT HEDGES ATTRIBUTED TO THE PERIOD PRESENTED TO GAAP NET INTEREST INCOME.  NET INTEREST INCOME  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE GENERATED $27.6 MILLION OF NET INTEREST INCOME, CONSISTING OF $68.9 MILLION  OF INTEREST INCOME FROM RMBS ASSETS OFFSET BY $41.3 MILLION OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON BORROWINGS.  FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, WE GENERATED $46.8 MILLION OF NET INTEREST INCOME, CONSISTING OF $78.5 MILLION OF INTEREST INCOME FROM  RMBS ASSETS OFFSET BY $31.7 MILLION OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON BORROWINGS.   THE $9.6 MILLION DECREASE IN INTEREST INCOME WAS DUE TO THE $551.8 MILLION DECREASE IN AVERAGE RMBS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 12 BASIS POINT (\"BPS\") INCREASE IN THE YIELD ON  AVERAGE RMBS. THE $9.6 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE WAS DUE TO AN 95 BPS INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST OF FUNDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $533.5 MILLION DECREASE IN AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS. WE HAD FEWER ASSETS AND BORROWINGS DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 AS A RESULT OF STOCK REPURCHASES AND A REDUCTION IN THE VALUATION OF OUR ASSETS.  ON AN ECONOMIC BASIS, OUR INTEREST EXPENSE ON BORROWINGS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018 WAS $37.4 MILLION  AND $35.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTING IN $31.5 MILLION AND $42.9 MILLION OF ECONOMIC NET INTEREST INCOME, RESPECTIVELY.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WE GENERATED $14.0 MILLION OF NET INTEREST INCOME, CONSISTING OF $36.5 MILLION  OF INTEREST INCOME FROM RMBS ASSETS OFFSET BY $22.4 MILLION OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON BORROWINGS.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018, WE GENERATED $22.0 MILLION OF NET INTEREST INCOME, CONSISTING OF $38.6 MILLION OF INTEREST INCOME FROM RMBS  ASSETS OFFSET BY $16.6 MILLION OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON BORROWINGS.  THE $2.1 MILLION DECREASE IN INTEREST INCOME WAS DUE TO THE $409.8 MILLION DECREASE IN AVERAGE RMBS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 26 BPS INCREASE IN THE YIELD ON AVERAGE RMBS. THE $5.9  MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE WAS DUE TO A 102 BPS INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST OF FUNDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $436.4 MILLION DECREASE IN AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS.

OUR AVERAGE COST OF FUNDS WAS 2.73% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO 1.78% FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN 2018. CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS A 95 BPS INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST OF FUNDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $533.5 MILLION DECREASE IN AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  THE  HIGHER COST OF FUNDS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, REFLECTS THE HIGHER SHORT-TERM RATES AS PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW.  OUR ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $37.4 MILLION AND $35.6 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018,  RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS A 48 BPS INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE ECONOMIC COST OF FUNDS TO 2.48% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM 2.00% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  THE REASON FOR THE INCREASE IN ECONOMIC COST OF FUNDS IS PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF OUR BORROWINGS NOTED ABOVE.  WE HAD AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OF $3,098.1 MILLION AND $3,534.6 MILLION AND TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE OF $22.4 MILLION  AND $16.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OUR AVERAGE COST OF FUNDS WAS 2.90% AND 1.88% FOR THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS A 102 BPS INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST OF  FUNDS AND A $436.4 MILLION DECREASE IN AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018.  AS IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE HIGHER COST OF FUNDS FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, REFLECTS HIGHER SHORT-TERM RATES.  OUR ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $21.0 MILLION AND $17.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018,  RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS A 74 BPS INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE ECONOMIC COST OF FUNDS TO 2.71% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 FROM 1.97% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE INCREASE IN ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE DURING THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES CHARGED FOR THOSE BORROWINGS.  30  SINCE ALL OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE SHORT-TERM, CHANGES IN MARKET RATES DIRECTLY AFFECT OUR INTEREST EXPENSE. OUR  AVERAGE COST OF FUNDS CALCULATED ON A GAAP BASIS WAS 45 BPS ABOVE THE AVERAGE ONE-MONTH LIBOR AND 41 BPS ABOVE THE AVERAGE SIX-MONTH LIBOR FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  OUR AVERAGE ECONOMIC COST OF FUNDS WAS 26 BPS ABOVE THE AVERAGE  ONE-MONTH LIBOR AND 22 BPS ABOVE THE AVERAGE SIX-MONTH LIBOR FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2019. THE AVERAGE TERM TO MATURITY OF THE OUTSTANDING REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS INCREASED TO 58 DAYS AT JUNE 30, 2019 FROM 31 DAYS AT DECEMBER 31, 2018.

NONE OF THESE LENDERS ARE AFFILIATED WITH THE COMPANY. THESE BORROWINGS ARE SECURED BY THE COMPANY\u2019S RMBS AND CASH, AND BEAR INTEREST AT  PREVAILING MARKET RATES.  WE BELIEVE OUR ESTABLISHED REPURCHASE AGREEMENT BORROWING FACILITIES PROVIDE BORROWING CAPACITY IN EXCESS OF OUR NEEDS.  35  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $3,329.5 MILLION WITH  A NET WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING COST OF 2.63%. THE REMAINING MATURITY OF OUR OUTSTANDING REPURCHASE AGREEMENT OBLIGATIONS RANGED FROM 1 TO 284 DAYS, WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE REMAINING MATURITY OF 58 DAYS.  SECURING THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT  OBLIGATIONS AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 ARE RMBS WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST, OF APPROXIMATELY $3,518.5 MILLION AND A WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF 313 MONTHS, AND CASH PLEDGED TO COUNTERPARTIES OF APPROXIMATELY $32.7  MILLION.  THROUGH JULY 26, 2019, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR REPURCHASE FACILITIES WITH COMPARABLE TERMS TO THOSE THAT EXISTED AT JUNE 30, 2019 WITH MATURITIES THROUGH APRIL 9, 2020.

OUR PRINCIPAL IMMEDIATE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY INCLUDE CASH BALANCES, UNENCUMBERED ASSETS AND BORROWINGS UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  OUR BORROWING CAPACITY WILL VARY OVER TIME  AS THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR INTEREST EARNING ASSETS VARIES.  OUR BALANCE SHEET ALSO GENERATES LIQUIDITY ON AN ON-GOING BASIS THROUGH PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WE RECEIVE ON OUR RMBS PORTFOLIO.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE  SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR (A) THE ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS CONSISTENT WITH THE SIZE AND NATURE OF OUR EXISTING RMBS PORTFOLIO, (B) THE REPAYMENTS ON BORROWINGS AND (C) THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO THE  EXTENT REQUIRED FOR OUR CONTINUED QUALIFICATION AS A REIT.  WE MAY ALSO GENERATE LIQUIDITY FROM TIME TO TIME BY SELLING OUR EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES IN PUBLIC OFFERINGS OR PRIVATE PLACEMENTS.  BECAUSE OUR PT RMBS PORTFOLIO CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE HAVING DIFFICULTY  CONVERTING OUR ASSETS TO CASH SHOULD OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS EVER EXCEED OUR IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE SOURCES OF CASH.  OUR STRUCTURED RMBS PORTFOLIO ALSO CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY SECURITIES, ALTHOUGH THEY TYPICALLY DO NOT TRADE WITH  COMPARABLE BID / ASK SPREADS AS PT RMBS.  HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO LIQUIDATE SUCH SECURITIES READILY, EVEN IN DISTRESSED MARKETS, ALTHOUGH WE WOULD LIKELY DO SO AT PRICES BELOW WHERE SUCH SECURITIES COULD BE SOLD IN A MORE  STABLE MARKET.  TO ENHANCE OUR LIQUIDITY EVEN FURTHER, WE MAY PLEDGE A PORTION OF OUR STRUCTURED RMBS AS PART OF A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT FUNDING, BUT RETAIN THE CASH IN LIEU OF ACQUIRING ADDITIONAL ASSETS.  IN THIS WAY WE CAN, AT A MODEST COST,  RETAIN HIGHER LEVELS OF CASH ON HAND AND DECREASE THE LIKELIHOOD WE WILL HAVE TO SELL ASSETS IN A DISTRESSED MARKET IN ORDER TO RAISE CASH.  OUR STRATEGY FOR HEDGING OUR FUNDING COSTS TYPICALLY INVOLVES TAKING SHORT POSITIONS IN INTEREST RATE FUTURES, TREASURY  FUTURES, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, INTEREST RATE SWAPTIONS OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS. WHEN THE MARKET CAUSES THESE SHORT POSITIONS TO DECLINE IN VALUE WE ARE REQUIRED TO MEET MARGIN CALLS WITH CASH.  THIS CAN REDUCE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION TO THE EXTENT  OTHER SECURITIES IN OUR PORTFOLIO MOVE IN PRICE IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE DO NOT RECEIVE ENOUGH CASH VIA MARGIN CALLS TO OFFSET THE DERIVATIVE RELATED MARGIN CALLS. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR IN SUFFICIENT MAGNITUDE, THE LOSS OF LIQUIDITY MIGHT FORCE US  TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE LEVERED PORTFOLIO, PLEDGE ADDITIONAL STRUCTURED SECURITIES TO RAISE FUNDS OR RISK OPERATING THE PORTFOLIO WITH LESS LIQUIDITY.  36  OUR MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS HAVE NO STATED EXPIRATION, BUT CAN BE TERMINATED AT ANY TIME AT OUR OPTION OR AT THE  OPTION OF THE COUNTERPARTY. HOWEVER, ONCE A DEFINITIVE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT UNDER A MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENT HAS BEEN ENTERED INTO, IT GENERALLY MAY NOT BE TERMINATED BY EITHER PARTY.  A NEGOTIATED TERMINATION CAN OCCUR, BUT MAY INVOLVE A FEE  TO BE PAID BY THE PARTY SEEKING TO TERMINATE THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT TRANSACTION.  UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENT FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO POST MARGIN AT THE INITIATION OF THE BORROWING.  THE MARGIN POSTED REPRESENTS THE HAIRCUT, WHICH IS A PERCENTAGE OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL PLEDGED. TO THE EXTENT THE MARKET VALUE OF THE ASSET COLLATERALIZING THE FINANCING TRANSACTION DECLINES, THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR POSTED MARGIN  WILL BE INSUFFICIENT AND WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.  CONVERSELY, IF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE ASSET PLEDGED INCREASES IN VALUE, WE WOULD BE OVER COLLATERALIZED AND WE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO HAVE EXCESS MARGIN RETURNED TO US BY  THE COUNTERPARTY.  OUR LENDERS TYPICALLY VALUE OUR PLEDGED SECURITIES DAILY TO ENSURE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR MARGIN AND MAKE MARGIN CALLS AS NEEDED, AS DO WE.  TYPICALLY, BUT NOT ALWAYS, THE PARTIES AGREE TO A MINIMUM THRESHOLD AMOUNT FOR MARGIN  CALLS SO AS TO AVOID THE NEED FOR NUISANCE MARGIN CALLS ON A DAILY BASIS.  OUR MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS DO NOT SPECIFY THE HAIRCUT; RATHER HAIRCUTS ARE  DETERMINED ON AN INDIVIDUAL REPURCHASE TRANSACTION BASIS. THROUGHOUT THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, HAIRCUTS ON OUR PLEDGED COLLATERAL REMAINED STABLE AND AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE HAIRCUT WAS APPROXIMATELY 5.4% OF THE VALUE  OF OUR COLLATERAL.  AS DISCUSSED EARLIER, WE INVEST A PORTION OF OUR CAPITAL IN STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS.  WE GENERALLY DO NOT APPLY LEVERAGE TO  THIS PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  THE LEVERAGE INHERENT IN STRUCTURED SECURITIES REPLACES THE LEVERAGE OBTAINED BY ACQUIRING PT SECURITIES AND FUNDING THEM IN THE REPURCHASE MARKET.  THIS STRUCTURED RMBS STRATEGY HAS BEEN A CORE ELEMENT OF THE  COMPANY\u2019S OVERALL INVESTMENT STRATEGY SINCE INCEPTION.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE AND MAY CONTINUE TO PLEDGE A PORTION OF OUR STRUCTURED RMBS IN ORDER TO RAISE OUR CASH LEVELS, BUT GENERALLY WILL NOT PLEDGE THESE SECURITIES IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL  ASSETS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS FROM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR REPURCHASE  AGREEMENTS AND INTEREST EXPENSE ON REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

IN FUTURE PERIODS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FINANCE OUR ACTIVITIES IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR CURRENT  OPERATIONS THROUGH REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $135.6 MILLION.  WE GENERATED CASH FLOWS OF $299.3 MILLION FROM PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON OUR RMBS AND HAD AVERAGE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS  OUTSTANDING OF $3,022.0 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY  ON AUGUST 2, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO AN EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT (THE \u201cAUGUST 2017 EQUITY DISTRIBUTION  AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH TWO SALES AGENTS PURSUANT TO WHICH WE MAY OFFER AND SELL, FROM TIME TO TIME, UP TO AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $125,000,000 OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE \u201cAT THE MARKET\u201d OFFERINGS AND PRIVATELY  NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THROUGH JUNE 30, 2019, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF 13,351,877 SHARES UNDER THE AUGUST 2017 EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT FOR AGGREGATE GROSS PROCEEDS OF $113.7 MILLION, AND NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $112.0 MILLION, NET OF  COMMISSIONS AND FEES. SUBSEQUENT TO JUNE 30, 2019, WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL 1,771,301 SHARES UNDER THE AUGUST 2017 EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT FOR AGGREGATE GROSS PROCEEDS OF $11.3 MILLION, AND NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $11.1 MILLION, NET OF  COMMISSIONS AND FEES.  37  OUTLOOK  THE TRANSITION IN THE OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY AND INTEREST RATE POLICY ON THE PART OF THE FED THAT STARTED DURING THE  FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 CONTINUED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.  AFTER SWITCHING FROM A TIGHTENING BIAS AND HIKING THE FED FUNDS RATE FOR THE NINTH TIME IN DECEMBER 2018  ,  THE FED SHIFTED TO A BALANCED OUTLOOK DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THE FED SHIFTED AGAIN DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY IN THE U.S. APPEARS TO BE SLOWING SOMEWHAT, MAINLY AS A RESULT OF THE  MANUFACTURING SECTOR SLOWING FROM THE TORRID PACE OF 2018.  GROWTH IN THE CONSUMER/CONSUMPTION SECTOR REMAINS SOLID, SUPPORTED BY A STILL STRONG JOB MARKET WITH GREATER THAN 3% WAGE GROWTH. HOWEVER, GROWTH OVERSEAS IS CLEARLY SLOWING.  THESE  DEVELOPMENTS, COUPLED WITH INFLATION MOVING BELOW THE FED\u2019S 2% TARGET, CAUSED THE FED TO SHIFT ITS POLICY OUTLOOK FROM STABLE TO LEANING TOWARDS AN EASING POLICY.  IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE FED WILL LOWER THE FED FUNDS RATE AT THEIR MEETING WHICH  CONCLUDES ON JULY 31, 2019.  THE FED WAS NOT THE ONLY CENTRAL BANK TO SHIFT ITS POLICY OUTLOOK.  THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK (THE \u201cECB\u201d) ALSO ADOPTED A  MORE ACCOMMODATIVE OUTLOOK AT THEIR MEETING ON JUNE 6, 2019.  THE SHIFT IN POLICY ON THE PART OF THE FED AND THE ECB WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY SEVERAL DEVELOPMENTS.  CENTRAL TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS TO THE GLOBAL GROWTH OUTLOOK  ,  COUPLED WITH DECLINING INFLATION EXPECTATIONS.  THE GREATEST RISK TO GLOBAL GROWTH IS THE DETERIORATING TRADE ENVIRONMENT.  TRADE TALKS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA  BROKE DOWN IN EARLY MAY 2019 AND APPEAR NOT TO HAVE BEEN MATERIALLY RESURRECTED, AS HAD BEEN EXPECTED, AT THE G-20 MEETING IN LATE JUNE 2019.  AS PART OF HIS EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE IMMIGRATION CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE U.S., PRESIDENT  TRUMP SURPRISED THE MARKET IN LATE MAY 2019 WITH THREATS TO IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT TARIFFS ON GOODS IMPORTED FROM MEXICO.  NEGOTIATIONS FOLLOWED SHORTLY THEREAFTER. THE TARIFFS HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE FOR NOW, BUT THE IMPACT ON MARKET SENTIMENT AND RISK  PREMIUMS WAS SIGNIFICANT.  TRADE UNCERTAINTY IS THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED CONCERN BY CENTRAL BANKERS ACROSS THE GLOBE \u2013 ESPECIALLY THE ECB AND THE FED.  THE MANUFACTURING SIDE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY HAS CLEARLY BEEN SLOWING, AS GLOBAL PURCHASING  MANAGER SURVEYS HAVE DECLINED AND ARE ON THE VERGE OF BREAKING BELOW THE PSYCHOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT 50 LEVEL.  ADDING TO GROWTH PESSIMISM, THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE U.K., THERESA MAY, RESIGNED AS HER EFFORTS TO ORCHESTRATE AN ORDERLY BREXIT FROM  THE EUROPEAN UNION (THE \u201cEU\u201d) FLOUNDERED.  ON WEDNESDAY, JULY 24, 2019, BORIS JOHNSON BECAME THE NEW PRIME MINISTER; HOWEVER, THE OUTLOOK FOR AN ORDERLY BREXIT REMAINS UNCERTAIN.  THE MARKET REACTION TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE POSSIBLE TARIFFS ON MEXICAN IMPORTED GOODS WAS A SIGNIFICANT RALLY AS RATES  DECLINED AND THE U.S. TREASURY CURVE INVERTED (AS REFLECTED BY THE SPREAD BETWEEN 3-MONTH TREASURY BILLS AND THE TEN-YEAR U.S. TREASURY NOTE), AND HAS ONLY RECENTLY MOVED BACK ABOVE ZERO.  AS REFLECTED BY FED FUNDS FUTURES CONTRACTS, THE MARKET  NOW EXPECTS THE FED TO LOWER THE FED FUNDS TARGET RANGE WITH TWO OR THREE 25 BASIS POINT MOVES OVER THE BALANCE OF 2019. THERE HAS BEEN A PRONOUNCED SHIFT IN THE TONE OF THE FED CHAIRMAN AND THE VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET  COMMITTEE (\u201cFOMC\u201d).  BASED ON THEIR PUBLIC COMMENTS, THE CHAIRMAN AND THE VARIOUS OTHER GOVERNORS APPEAR TO BE FOCUSED ON THE OUTLOOK FOR TRADE NEGOTIATIONS, GLOBAL GROWTH AND INFLATION LEVELS/EXPECTATIONS GOING FORWARD.  THEY APPEAR TO BE  WILLING TO LOOK PAST THE CURRENT STATE OF GROWTH \u2013 WHICH REMAINS SOLID.  THE AGENCY MBS MARKET HAD A POSITIVE TOTAL RETURN FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2.0% PER DATA PROVIDED BY BANK OF MERRILL  LYNCH/ICE DATA INDICES. WITH THE DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES OCCURRING OVER THE COURSE OF THE QUARTER  ,  LONGER DURATION COUPONS OUTPERFORMED SHORTER DURATION COUPONS  AND 30-YEAR SECURITIES OUTPERFORMED 15-YEAR SECURITIES. HOWEVER, RETURNS VERSUS EQUIVALENT DURATION U.S. TREASURIES WERE NEGATIVE ACROSS THE AGENCY MBS UNIVERSE.  AS INTEREST RATES FELL  ,  RATE VOLATILITY ROSE, BOTH REALIZED AND IMPLIED, AND PREPAYMENT FEARS INCREASED.  BOTH OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE TYPICALLY BAD FOR MBS SECURITIES.  AS INTEREST RATES SETTLED INTO A RANGE NEAR THE END OF THE SECOND  QUARTER AND INTO THE THIRD QUARTER, VOLATILITY HAS DECLINED AND AGENCY MBS ASSETS HAVE OUTPERFORMED COMPARABLE DURATION U.S. TREASURIES.  38  IN JUNE 2019 THE UNIFORM MBS (\u201cUMBS\u201d) BEGAN TRADING.  UMBS ARE PASSTHROUGH SECURITIES REPRESENTING AN INTEREST IN A POOL OF  RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES THAT ARE ISSUED AND GUARANTEED BY EITHER FANNIE MAE OR FREDDIE MAC. THE UMBS WERE DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE DIFFERENCES IN UNDERWRITING, SERVICING AND TRADING LEVELS BETWEEN FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC SECURITIES AND TO INCREASE  LIQUIDITY IN THE TBA MARKET.  IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW EFFECTIVE THE UMBS PROGRAM WILL BE AT ACCOMPLISHING THESE OBJECTIVES.  THE OTHER SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT IN THE AGENCY MBS MARKET WAS THE CONTINUED DETERIORATION IN THE TBA MARKET.  WITH  LOWER RATES AVAILABLE TO BORROWERS AND RATES CONTINUING TO DECLINE INTO THE THIRD QUARTER \u2013 REFINANCING ACTIVITY HAS INCREASED AND ALL AGENCY LOANS OUTSIDE OF THE SPECIFIED POOL MARKET CONTINUE TO EXHIBIT VERY POOR PREPAYMENT BEHAVIOR.  THE  COLLATERAL GENERALLY HAS HISTORICALLY HIGH GROSS WEIGHTED AVERAGE COUPONS FOR ANY GIVEN COUPON, HIGHER LOAN BALANCES AND HIGHER FICO SCORES \u2013 ALL CONSISTENT WITH HIGHER PREPAYMENT EXPECTATIONS.  THIS HAS LED TO A MATERIAL INCREASE IN PREMIUMS  CHARGED FOR POOLS WITH MORE DESIRABLE PREPAYMENT CHARACTERISTICS.  WHILE THESE PREMIUMS HAVE INCREASED, AND ARE VERY HIGH FOR THE CURRENT LEVEL OF RATES, THE ALL-IN PRICE FOR SPECIFIED SECURITIES IS HISTORICALLY LOW FOR THE LEVEL OF RATES.  THIS  IS BECAUSE THE DOLLAR PRICES FOR THE VARIOUS TBA SECURITIES IS VERY LOW FOR THE LEVEL OF RATES \u2013 REFLECTING THE VERY POOR PREPAYMENT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TBA COLLATERAL.  RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS  IN SEPTEMBER 2017, THE FOMC ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD IMPLEMENT A BALANCE SHEET NORMALIZATION POLICY BY GRADUALLY DECREASING  THE FED\u2019S REINVESTMENT OF U.S. TREASURIES AND AGENCY RMBS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY THE FED WILL BE REINVESTED ONLY TO THE EXTENT THEY EXCEED GRADUALLY RISING CAPS UNTIL THE FOMC DETERMINES THAT THE FED IS HOLDING NO MORE  SECURITIES THAN NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT MONETARY POLICY EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. IN OCTOBER 2017, THE FOMC COMMENCED THIS BALANCE SHEET NORMALIZATION PROGRAM. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MARCH 2019 FOMC MEETING, THE FED SAID THAT THE FOMC INTENDS  TO SLOW THE PACE OF THE DECLINE IN ITS HOLDINGS OF U.S. TREASURIES AND AGENCY RMBS OVER COMING QUARTERS PROVIDED THAT THE ECONOMY AND MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS EVOLVE ABOUT AS EXPECTED. THE FED SPECIFIED THAT THE FOMC INTENDS TO REDUCE THE RUN-OFF  OF ITS HOLDINGS OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES BY REDUCING THE CAP ON MONTHLY REDEMPTIONS FROM THE CURRENT LEVEL OF $30 BILLION TO $15 BILLION BEGINNING IN MAY 2019, AND CONTINUE TO ALLOW ITS HOLDINGS OF AGENCY RMBS TO DECLINE, CONSISTENT WITH THE  AIM OF HOLDING PRIMARILY U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES IN THE LONG RUN. BEGINNING IN OCTOBER 2019 PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS FROM AGENCY RMBS OR AGENCY DEBT WILL BE REINVESTED IN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM OF $20 BILLION PER MONTH, WITH ANY  PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS IN EXCESS OF THAT MAXIMUM REINVESTED IN AGENCY RMBS.  IN 2017, POLICYMAKERS ANNOUNCED THAT LIBOR WILL BE REPLACED BY 2021. THE DIRECTIVE WAS SPURRED BY THE FACT THAT BANKS ARE  UNCOMFORTABLE CONTRIBUTING TO THE LIBOR PANEL GIVEN THE SHORTAGE OF UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS ON WHICH TO BASE LEVELS AND THE LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMITTING AN UNFOUNDED LEVEL. LIBOR WILL BE REPLACED WITH A NEW SOFR, A RATE BASED ON U.S. REPO  TRADING. THE NEW BENCHMARK RATE WILL BE BASED ON OVERNIGHT TREASURY GENERAL COLLATERAL REPO RATES. THE RATE-SETTING PROCESS WILL BE MANAGED AND PUBLISHED BY THE FED AND THE TREASURY\u2019S OFFICE OF FINANCIAL RESEARCH. MANY BANKS BELIEVE THAT IT MAY  TAKE FOUR TO FIVE YEARS TO COMPLETE THE TRANSITION TO SOFR, DESPITE THE 2021 DEADLINE. WE WILL MONITOR THE EMERGENCE OF THIS NEW RATE CAREFULLY AS IT WILL LIKELY BECOME THE NEW BENCHMARK FOR HEDGES AND A RANGE OF INTEREST RATE INVESTMENTS.  IN JANUARY 2019, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MADE STATEMENTS OF ITS PLANS TO WORK WITH CONGRESS TO OVERHAUL FANNIE MAE AND  FREDDIE MAC AND EXPECTATIONS TO ANNOUNCE A FRAMEWORK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A POLICY FOR COMPREHENSIVE HOUSING FINANCE REFORM SOON. AT THIS TIME, HOWEVER, NO DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE ON ANY REFORM PLAN.  THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF THE ACTIONS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OR THE FED WILL ULTIMATELY UNDERTAKE ARE UNKNOWN AND WILL CONTINUE  TO EVOLVE.  ALTHOUGH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE STATEMENTS OF ITS INTENTIONS TO REFORM HOUSING FINANCE AND TAX POLICY, MANY OF THESE POTENTIAL POLICY CHANGES WILL REQUIRE CONGRESSIONAL ACTION.  IN ADDITION, THE FED HAS MADE STATEMENTS  REGARDING ADDITIONAL INCREASES TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN 2019 AND BEYOND.  39  EFFECT ON US  REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, MOVEMENTS IN INTEREST RATES AND PREPAYMENT RATES AFFECT US IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  EFFECTS ON OUR ASSETS  A CHANGE IN OR ELIMINATION OF THE GUARANTEE STRUCTURE OF AGENCY RMBS MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS (IF, FOR EXAMPLE, GUARANTEE  FEES INCREASE) OR REQUIRE US TO CHANGE OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY ALTOGETHER. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ELIMINATION OF THE GUARANTEE STRUCTURE OF AGENCY RMBS MAY CAUSE US TO CHANGE OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY TO FOCUS ON NON-AGENCY RMBS, WHICH IN TURN WOULD  REQUIRE US TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR MONITORING OF THE CREDIT RISKS OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN ADDITION TO INTEREST RATE AND PREPAYMENT RISKS.  LOWER LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES CAN AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR AGENCY RMBS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. IF PREPAYMENT RATES ARE  RELATIVELY LOW (DUE, IN PART, TO THE REFINANCING PROBLEMS DESCRIBED ABOVE), LOWER LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES CAN INCREASE THE VALUE OF HIGHER-COUPON AGENCY RMBS. THIS IS BECAUSE INVESTORS TYPICALLY PLACE A PREMIUM ON ASSETS WITH YIELDS THAT ARE  HIGHER THAN MARKET YIELDS. ALTHOUGH LOWER LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES MAY INCREASE ASSET VALUES IN OUR PORTFOLIO, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO INVEST NEW FUNDS IN SIMILARLY-YIELDING ASSETS.  IF PREPAYMENT LEVELS INCREASE, THE VALUE OF OUR AGENCY RMBS AFFECTED BY SUCH PREPAYMENTS MAY DECLINE. THIS IS BECAUSE A  PRINCIPAL PREPAYMENT ACCELERATES THE EFFECTIVE TERM OF AN AGENCY RMBS, WHICH WOULD SHORTEN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH AN INVESTOR WOULD RECEIVE ABOVE-MARKET RETURNS (ASSUMING THE YIELD ON THE PREPAID ASSET IS HIGHER THAN MARKET YIELDS). ALSO,  PREPAYMENT PROCEEDS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE REINVESTED IN SIMILAR-YIELDING ASSETS. AGENCY RMBS BACKED BY MORTGAGES WITH HIGH INTEREST RATES ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO PREPAYMENT RISK BECAUSE HOLDERS OF THOSE MORTGAGES ARE MOST LIKELY TO REFINANCE TO A  LOWER RATE. IOS AND IIOS, HOWEVER, MAY BE THE TYPES OF AGENCY RMBS MOST SENSITIVE TO INCREASED PREPAYMENT RATES. BECAUSE THE HOLDER OF AN IO OR IIO RECEIVES NO PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS, THE VALUES OF IOS AND IIOS ARE ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE EXISTENCE  OF A PRINCIPAL BALANCE ON THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES. IF THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE IS ELIMINATED DUE TO PREPAYMENT, IOS AND IIOS ESSENTIALLY BECOME WORTHLESS. ALTHOUGH INCREASED PREPAYMENT RATES CAN NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR IOS AND IIOS, THEY  HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT ON POS. BECAUSE POS ACT LIKE ZERO-COUPON BONDS, MEANING THEY ARE PURCHASED AT A DISCOUNT TO THEIR PAR VALUE AND HAVE AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE BASED ON THE DISCOUNT AND THE TERM OF THE UNDERLYING LOAN, AN INCREASE IN  PREPAYMENT RATES WOULD REDUCE THE EFFECTIVE TERM OF OUR POS AND ACCELERATE THE YIELDS EARNED ON THOSE ASSETS, WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR NET INCOME.  HIGHER LONG-TERM RATES CAN ALSO AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR AGENCY RMBS.  AS LONG-TERM RATES RISE, RATES AVAILABLE TO BORROWERS  ALSO RISE.  THIS TENDS TO CAUSE PREPAYMENT ACTIVITY TO SLOW AND EXTEND THE EXPECTED AVERAGE LIFE OF MORTGAGE CASH FLOWS.  AS THE EXPECTED AVERAGE LIFE OF THE MORTGAGE CASH FLOWS INCREASES, COUPLED WITH HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES, THE VALUE OF AGENCY  RMBS DECLINES.  SOME OF THE INSTRUMENTS THE COMPANY USES TO HEDGE OUR AGENCY RMBS ASSETS, SUCH AS EURO DOLLAR FUTURES, SWAPS, INTEREST RATE FUTURES AND SWAPTIONS, ARE STABLE AVERAGE LIFE INSTRUMENTS.  THIS MEANS THAT TO THE EXTENT WE USE SUCH  INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE OUR AGENCY RMBS ASSETS, OUR HEDGES MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT US FROM PRICE DECLINES, AND THEREFORE MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BOOK VALUE.  IT IS FOR THIS REASON WE USE INTEREST ONLY SECURITIES IN OUR PORTFOLIO. AS INTEREST  RATES RISE, THE EXPECTED AVERAGE LIFE OF THESE SECURITIES INCREASES, CAUSING GENERALLY POSITIVE PRICE MOVEMENTS AS THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF THE CASH FLOWS INCREASE THE LONGER THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES REMAIN OUTSTANDING. THIS MAKES INTEREST ONLY  SECURITIES DESIRABLE HEDGE INSTRUMENTS FOR PASS-THROUGH AGENCY RMBS.  40  AS THE ECONOMY HAS REBOUNDED FROM THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE FED HAS TAKEN STEPS TO REMOVE THE CONSIDERABLE ACCOMMODATION  THAT WAS EMPLOYED TO COMBAT THE CRISIS.  AT THE CONCLUSION OF ITS MEETING IN SEPTEMBER 2017, THE FED ANNOUNCED IT WOULD IMPLEMENT CAPS ON THE AMOUNT OF AGENCY RMBS ASSETS IT WOULD ALLOW TO RUN OFF, OR NOT BE RE-INVESTED, STARTING IN OCTOBER  2017.  PREVIOUSLY THE FED WOULD RE-INVEST ALL OF THE PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS IT RECEIVED EACH MONTH ON THE AGENCY RMBS ASSETS IT HAD ACQUIRED DURING ITS QUANTITATIVE EASING PROGRAMS.  BY CAPPING THE AMOUNT THEY WOULD ALLOW TO RUN OFF EACH MONTH, THE  FED WAS EFFECTIVELY LIMITING THE AMOUNT IT WOULD RE-INVEST.  PER THE FED\u2019S SEPTEMBER 2017 ANNOUNCEMENT, THE CAP REACHED $20 BILLION PER MONTH IN OCTOBER 2018.  AT THE TIME OF THE FED\u2019S ANNOUNCEMENT IN SEPTEMBER 2017, ITS MONTHLY RE-INVESTMENTS  WERE APPROXIMATELY $20 BILLION PER MONTH AS WELL, SO THIS IMPLIED THE FED WOULD STOP, OR NEARLY STOP, RE-INVESTING ITS MONTHLY PAY-DOWNS BEYOND OCTOBER 2018.  THE PURCHASES EACH MONTH BY THE FED HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF DEMAND IN THE  AGENCY RMBS MARKET AND AS IT WAS REDUCED SLOWLY OVER THE COURSE OF 2018 AND ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATED BEYOND OCTOBER 2018, THE REMOVAL OF THIS SOURCE OF DEMAND COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT AGENCY RMBS PRICES.  THE EXTENT THIS NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE  AGENCY RMBS MARKET WILL BE A FUNCTION OF THE LEVEL OF SUPPLY EACH MONTH \u2013 AS THE SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCE AFFECTS THE PRICE OF ANY ASSET \u2013 AND WHETHER OR NOT ANOTHER SOURCE OF DEMAND EMERGES TO REPLACE THE FED. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MARCH 2019  FOMC MEETING, THE FED SAID THAT THE FOMC INTENDS TO SLOW THE PACE OF THE DECLINE IN ITS HOLDINGS OF U.S. TREASURIES AND AGENCY RMBS OVER COMING QUARTERS PROVIDED THAT THE ECONOMY AND MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS EVOLVE ABOUT AS EXPECTED. THE FED  SPECIFIED THAT THE FOMC INTENDS TO REDUCE THE RUN-OFF OF ITS HOLDINGS OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES BY REDUCING THE CAP ON MONTHLY REDEMPTIONS FROM THE CURRENT LEVEL OF $30 BILLION TO $15 BILLION BEGINNING IN MAY 2019, AND CONTINUE TO ALLOW ITS  HOLDINGS OF AGENCY RMBS TO DECLINE, CONSISTENT WITH THE AIM OF HOLDING PRIMARILY U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES IN THE LONG RUN. BEGINNING IN OCTOBER 2019 PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS FROM AGENCY RMBS OR AGENCY DEBT WILL BE REINVESTED IN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES  SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM OF $20 BILLION PER MONTH, WITH ANY PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS IN EXCESS OF THAT MAXIMUM REINVESTED IN AGENCY RMBS.  BECAUSE WE BASE OUR INVESTMENT DECISIONS ON RISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES RATHER THAN ANTICIPATED MOVEMENTS IN INTEREST RATES,  IN A VOLATILE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT WE MAY ALLOCATE MORE CAPITAL TO STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS WITH SHORTER DURATIONS. WE BELIEVE THESE SECURITIES HAVE A LOWER SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES THAN OTHER ASSET CLASSES. WE MAY  ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE OUR EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES BY INVESTING IN IOS AND IIOS, WHICH TYPICALLY HAVE DIFFERENT SENSITIVITIES TO CHANGES IN LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES THAN PT RMBS, PARTICULARLY PT RMBS BACKED BY FIXED-RATE  MORTGAGES.  IF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC WERE TO MODIFY OR END THEIR REPURCHASE PROGRAMS, OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COULD BE NEGATIVELY  IMPACTED.  EFFECTS ON OUR BORROWING COSTS  WE LEVERAGE OUR PT RMBS PORTFOLIO AND A PORTION OF OUR STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS WITH PRINCIPAL BALANCES THROUGH THE USE OF  SHORT-TERM REPURCHASE AGREEMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE INTEREST RATES ON OUR DEBT ARE DETERMINED BY MARKET LEVELS OF BOTH THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AND LIBOR. AN INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE OR LIBOR WOULD INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, WHICH COULD  AFFECT OUR INTEREST RATE SPREAD IF THERE IS NO CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE INTEREST WE EARN ON OUR ASSETS. THIS WOULD BE MOST PREVALENT WITH RESPECT TO OUR AGENCY RMBS BACKED BY FIXED RATE MORTGAGE LOANS BECAUSE THE INTEREST RATE ON A  FIXED-RATE MORTGAGE LOAN DOES NOT CHANGE EVEN THOUGH MARKET RATES MAY CHANGE.  IN ORDER TO PROTECT OUR NET INTEREST MARGIN AGAINST INCREASES IN SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES, WE MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE  SWAPS, WHICH ECONOMICALLY CONVERT OUR FLOATING-RATE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT DEBT TO FIXED-RATE DEBT, OR UTILIZE OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS EURODOLLAR AND T-NOTE FUTURES CONTRACTS OR INTEREST RATE SWAPTIONS.  41  SUMMARY  THE TURN IN THE OUTLOOK FOR INTEREST RATE POLICY FROM THE FED WAS COMPLETED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.  THE  MULTI-YEAR TIGHTENING CYCLE THAT BEGAN IN LATE 2015 ENDED IN DECEMBER OF 2018.  AFTER A BRIEF PERIOD WITH A BALANCED OUTLOOK, THE FED APPEARS READY TO COMMENCE AN EASING CYCLE.  THE FED AND THEIR OUTLOOK FOR POLICY IS NOW ALIGNED WITH THE OTHER  MAJOR CENTRAL BANKS.  THE STRENGTH OF THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY ALONE DOES NOT APPEAR TO JUSTIFY THE CHANGE IN POLICY, AT LEAST NOT YET.  WHILE THE MANUFACTURING SIDE OF THE ECONOMY HAS SLOWED NOTICEABLY FROM THE LEVEL OBSERVED IN 2018, THE CONSUMER  AND CONSUMPTION SIDE HAS NOT.  THE JOB MARKET IN THE U.S. HAS NOT GENERATED THE GAINS SEEN IN PRIOR YEARS, BUT JOB GAINS ARE STILL ABOVE THE LEVEL NEEDED TO REDUCE EXCESS SLACK IN THE ECONOMY, TO THE EXTENT IT EXISTS.  INSTEAD THE FED IS FOCUSED  ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE \u2013 ESPECIALLY TRADE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA, THE THREAT OF ESCALATING TARIFFS, A GLOBAL GROWTH DECELERATION, ESPECIALLY IN CHINA AND THE EU, A POTENTIAL NO-DEAL BREXIT AND FADING INFLATION EXPECTATIONS.  THE EQUITY  MARKETS IN THE U.S. HAVE PERFORMED VERY WELL YEAR TO DATE, TO A LARGE EXTENT BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE WORLD\u2019S CENTRAL BANKS APPEAR READY TO INTERVENE IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC EXPANSION.  THE AGENCY MBS MARKET GENERATED A POSITIVE 2.0% RETURN FOR THE SECOND QUARTER, ALTHOUGH THIS RETURN LAGGED THAT OF  COMPARABLE DURATION TREASURY SECURITIES.  IN THE AGGREGATE THE AGENCY MBS SECTOR UNDERPERFORMED COMPARABLE DURATION TREASURIES BY 0.70%. THE DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES STOKED FEARS OF INCREASED LEVELS OF PREPAYMENT ACTIVITY.  WITH GENERIC LOAN  CHARACTERISTICS OF AGENCY MBS QUITE POOR, COUPLED WITH THE SEASONAL PEAK IN PREPAYMENT ACTIVITY, THE DECLINE IN RATES AVAILABLE TO BORROWERS AND SUBSEQUENT SURGE IN PRODUCTION VOLUMES OVERWHELMED AGENCY MBS PERFORMANCE. HEIGHTENED LEVELS OF  VOLATILITY ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED PERFORMANCE.  SINCE THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER, THE RATES MARKET APPEARS TO HAVE SETTLED INTO A RANGE AND VOLATILITY HAS ABATED, ALLOWING AGENCY MBS TO DO QUITE WELL, DESPITE STILL ELEVATED LEVELS OF DAILY  PRODUCTION OF NEW LOANS/SECURITIES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  OUR CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. GAAP REQUIRES OUR MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SOME COMPLEX  AND SUBJECTIVE DECISIONS AND ASSESSMENTS. OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INVOLVE DECISIONS AND ASSESSMENTS WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT REPORTED ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AS DISCUSSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  AT JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAD NO MATERIAL COMMITMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AT JUNE 30, 2019, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  DIVIDENDS  IN ADDITION TO OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT MUST BE SATISFIED TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, WE MUST PAY ANNUAL DIVIDENDS TO OUR  STOCKHOLDERS OF AT LEAST 90% OF OUR REIT TAXABLE INCOME, DETERMINED WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DEDUCTION FOR DIVIDENDS PAID AND EXCLUDING ANY NET CAPITAL GAINS. REIT TAXABLE INCOME (LOSS) IS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CODE, AND CAN BE GREATER  THAN OR LESS THAN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENT NET INCOME (LOSS) COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THESE BOOK TO TAX DIFFERENCES PRIMARILY RELATE TO THE RECOGNITION OF INTEREST INCOME ON RMBS, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON RMBS, AND THE AMORTIZATION  OF LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE TREATED AS FUNDING HEDGES FOR TAX PURPOSES.  42  WE INTEND TO PAY REGULAR MONTHLY DIVIDENDS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND HAVE DECLARED THE FOLLOWING DIVIDENDS SINCE THE  COMPLETION OF OUR IPO.

THE EFFECT OF THIS DIVIDEND IS  INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE BUT IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2019.  INFLATION  VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE IN NATURE. AS A RESULT, INTEREST RATES AND OTHER  FACTORS INFLUENCE OUR PERFORMANCE FAR MORE SO THAN DOES INFLATION. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES DO NOT NECESSARILY CORRELATE WITH INFLATION RATES OR CHANGES IN INFLATION RATES. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND OUR  DISTRIBUTIONS WILL BE DETERMINED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONSISTENT WITH OUR OBLIGATION TO DISTRIBUTE TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AT LEAST 90% OF OUR REIT TAXABLE INCOME ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR REIT QUALIFICATION; IN EACH CASE, OUR  ACTIVITIES AND BALANCE SHEET ARE MEASURED WITH REFERENCE TO HISTORICAL COST AND/OR FAIR MARKET VALUE WITHOUT CONSIDERING INFLATION.", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Orchid Island Capital, Inc.", "CIK": 1518621, "Date": "2019-07-26T00:00:00", "Ticker": "ORC", "Name": "Orchid Island Capital Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE MKT", "SIC": 6798.0, "Business": "FL", "Incorporated": "MD", "IRS": 273269228.0, "key": "20190726ORC", "labelr1": 0.8797653958944224, "labelr2": -0.8720930232558082, "labelr3": -9.237536656891496, "labelr4": 0.16155088852988345, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.70090675, "prof1": 0.29909328, "return1&2": 0.9998465525472278, "return1&2&3": 1.0922077443514435, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0904432730358518, "return2": 1.0087209302325582, "return1": 0.9912023460410556, "return3": 1.0923753665689149, "return4": 0.9983844911147012, "1_day_return": 0.8797653958944274, "cumulative_return1": 0.2896978852447436, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.09176964723990116, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.0055990516403743576, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.004021012990960853, "indexx": 1426, "cumreturn1b": 1.0297350565919845, "cumreturndow": 1.016131785913496, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0162270921989158}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1471, "level_0": 3215, "index": 88549, "text": "ITEM 2.

WE HAVE DISCUSSED MANY OF THESE FACTORS IN MORE DETAIL ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT AND IN THE 2018 FORM 10-K. THESE FACTORS ARE NOT NECESSARILY ALL THE FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT US. UNPREDICTABLE OR UNANTICIPATED FACTORS WE HAVE NOT DISCUSSED IN THIS REPORT AND IN THE 2018 FORM 10-K COULD ALSO HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON ACTUAL RESULTS OF MATTERS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. WE DO NOT INTEND TO UPDATE OUR DESCRIPTION OF IMPORTANT FACTORS EACH TIME A POTENTIAL IMPORTANT FACTOR ARISES, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WE ADVISE OUR SECURITY HOLDERS THAT THEY SHOULD (1) BE AWARE THAT FACTORS NOT REFERRED TO ABOVE COULD AFFECT THE ACCURACY OF OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND (2) USE CAUTION AND COMMON SENSE WHEN CONSIDERING OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE CRITICAL IN THE REFINING OF CRUDE OIL INTO GASOLINE, DIESEL, JET FUEL AND LUBES, THE MANUFACTURING OF PETROCHEMICALS AND POLYMERS, AS WELL AS THE GASIFICATION OF COAL INTO SYNGAS. THE TECHNOLOGY SEGMENT ALSO HAS A 50% OWNED UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE THAT PROVIDES PROPRIETARY PROCESS TECHNOLOGY LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED ENGINEERING SERVICES AND CATALYSTS, PRIMARILY FOR THE REFINING INDUSTRY. OUR JUNE 30, 2019 RPOS COMPOSITION FOR THIS SEGMENT  WAS 100% DOWNSTREAM AND PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS.  LOSS PROJECTS  OUR ACCRUAL OF PROVISIONS FOR  ESTIMATED LOSSES ON ACTIVE UNCOMPLETED CONTRACTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 WAS $132 MILLION AND PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE CAMERON LNG PROJECT AND THE FREEPORT LNG TRAINS 1 & 2 PROJECTS. OUR ACCRUAL OF PROVISIONS FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES ON ACTIVE UNCOMPLETED CONTRACTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS $266 MILLION AND PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE CAMERON LNG, FREEPORT LNG TRAINS 1 & 2, CALPINE AND ABKATUN-A2 PROJECTS. OUR FREEPORT LNG TRAIN 3 PROJECT IS NOT ANTICIPATED TO BE IN A LOSS POSITION.  OUR SUBSEA PIPELINE FLOWLINE INSTALLATION PROJECT IN SUPPORT OF THE AYATSIL FIELD OFFSHORE MEXICO FOR PEMEX (\u201cLINE 1 AND LINE 10\u201d) WAS ALSO DETERMINED TO BE IN SUBSTANTIAL LOSS POSITION AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW.  FOR PURPOSES OF THE DISCUSSION BELOW, WHEN WE REFER TO A PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION ON A CUMULATIVE BASIS, WE ARE REFERRING TO THE CUMULATIVE PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION, WHICH INCLUDES PROGRESS MADE PRIOR TO THE COMBINATION DATE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, AS OF THE COMBINATION DATE, WE RESET THE PROGRESS TO COMPLETION FOR ALL OF CB&I\u2019S PROJECTS THEN IN PROGRESS TO 0% FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES BASED ON THE REMAINING COSTS TO BE INCURRED AS OF THAT DATE.  SUMMARY INFORMATION FOR OUR SIGNIFICANT ONGOING LOSS PROJECTS AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 IS AS FOLLOWS.  CAMERON LNG  \u2015AT JUNE 30, 2019, OUR U.S. LNG EXPORT FACILITY PROJECT IN HACKBERRY, LOUISIANA FOR CAMERON LNG (BEING PERFORMED BY OUR NCSA OPERATING GROUP) WAS APPROXIMATELY 78% COMPLETE ON A POST-COMBINATION BASIS (APPROXIMATELY 93% ON A CUMULATIVE BASIS) AND HAD AN ACCRUED PROVISION FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $58 MILLION. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, NCSA PROJECT OPERATING MARGIN WAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY RECOGNITION OF APPROXIMATELY $110 MILLION OF INCENTIVES RELATED TO THE PROJECTED ACHIEVEMENT OF PROGRESS MILESTONES.  48  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FREEPORT LNG  \u2015AT JUNE 30, 2019, TRAINS 1 & 2 OF OUR U.S. LNG EXPORT FACILITY PROJECT IN FREEPORT, TEXAS FOR FREEPORT LNG (BEING PERFORMED BY OUR NCSA OPERATING GROUP) WERE APPROXIMATELY 87% COMPLETE ON A POST-COMBINATION BASIS (APPROXIMATELY 96% ON A  CUMULATIVE  BASIS) AND HAD AN ACCRUED PROVISION FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $19 MILLION. DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE PROJECT WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY $27 MILLION AND $54 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO CHANGES IN COST ESTIMATES RESULTING FROM INCREASES IN CONSTRUCTION AND SUBCONTRACTOR COSTS. THESE COST ESTIMATE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RECORDING OF APPROXIMATELY $11 MILLION OF INCENTIVE REVENUES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, FREEPORT LNG TRAIN 3 WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY $11 MILLION OF CHANGES IN COST ESTIMATES AT COMPLETION.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, FREEPORT LNG TRAIN 3 WAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY $5 MILLION OF CHANGES IN ESTIMATES, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY AND SAVINGS IN INDIRECT COSTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE FREEPORT LNG PROJECT TAKEN AS A WHOLE HAD AN OVERALL NEGATIVE $38 MILLION IMPACT ON OPERATING MARGIN AT COMPLETION.  LINE 1 AND LINE 10  \u2015 AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, OUR SUBSEA PIPELINE FLOWLINE INSTALLATION PROJECT IN SUPPORT OF THE AYATSIL FIELD OFFSHORE MEXICO (BEING PERFORMED BY OUR NCSA OPERATING GROUP) WAS APPROXIMATELY 85% COMPLETE AND HAD AN ACCRUED PROVISION FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION. DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE PROJECT WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY $10 MILLION AND $28 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF CHANGES IN COST ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH UNEXPECTED SCHEDULE EXTENSIONS, RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL VESSEL AND LABOR COSTS. THE PROJECT IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019.  SUMMARY INFORMATION FOR OUR SIGNIFICANT LOSS PROJECTS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE 2018 FORM 10-K THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 IS AS FOLLOWS.  CALPINE POWER PROJECT  \u2015AT JUNE 30, 2019, OUR U.S. GAS TURBINE POWER PROJECT FOR CALPINE (BEING PERFORMED BY OUR NCSA OPERATING GROUP) WAS APPROXIMATELY 99% COMPLETE ON A POST-COMBINATION BASIS (APPROXIMATELY 99.7% ON A PRE-COMBINATION BASIS), AND THE REMAINING ACCRUED PROVISION FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT.  ABKATUN-A2 PROJECT  \u2015AT JUNE 30, 2019, OUR ABKATUN-A2 PLATFORM PROJECT IN MEXICO FOR PEMEX (BEING PERFORMED BY OUR NCSA OPERATING GROUP) WAS APPROXIMATELY 99% COMPLETE, AND THE REMAINING ACCRUED PROVISION FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT.  REVIEW OF BUSINESS PORTFOLIO  WE HAVE PERFORMED A REVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS PORTFOLIO, WHICH INCLUDED BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN THE COMBINATION. OUR REVIEW SOUGHT TO DETERMINE IF ANY PORTIONS OF OUR BUSINESS ARE NON-CORE FOR PURPOSES OF OUR VERTICALLY INTEGRATED OFFERING MODEL. AS A RESULT OF OUR REVIEW, WE IDENTIFIED OUR INDUSTRIAL STORAGE TANK AND PIPE FABRICATION BUSINESSES AS NON-CORE FOR PURPOSES OF OUR VERTICALLY INTEGRATED OFFERING MODEL. WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF ALLOY PIPING PRODUCTS, THE DISTRIBUTION AND MANUFACTURING ARM OF OUR PIPE FABRICATION BUSINESS (\u201cAPP\u201d), DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. WE ARE CONTINUING TO PURSUE THE SALE OF THE REMAINING PORTION OF OUR PIPE FABRICATION BUSINESS.  WE HAVE IDENTIFIED POTENTIAL BUYERS FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL STORAGE TANK BUSINESS, AND SALES EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO THAT BUSINESS REMAIN ONGOING.  IN CONNECTION WITH THAT CONTEMPLATED SALE, WE MAY RETAIN A CONTINUING MINORITY OWNERSHIP OR OTHER ECONOMIC INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS.  OUR ANTICIPATED AGGREGATE NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE PIPE FABRICATION AND STORAGE TANK TRANSACTIONS ARE NOW EXPECTED TO BE LOWER THAN THE APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION WE PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED.  OUR ONGOING COMPETITIVE SALE PROCESS  ES ARE  NOW EXPECTED TO RESULT IN CLOSING  S  OF THE SALE  S  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019  ; HOWEVER, WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT EITHER SALE PROCESS WILL BE COMPLETED ON THE ANTICIPATED TIMELINE OR AT ALL  .  ANY  POTENTIAL SALE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE INDENTURE RELATING TO OUR SENIOR NOTES (EACH AS DEFINED AND DESCRIBED IN \u201c\u2014LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d BELOW) REQUIRE US TO USE THE NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM ANY SALE OF A BUSINESS GENERATING IN EXCESS OF $500 MILLION IN SALES PROCEEDS TO REDUCE OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT.  IF THE NET CASH PROCEEDS RECEIVED ARE LESS THAN $500 MILLION, OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND SUCH INDENTURE PERMIT US TO REINVEST THOSE PROCEEDS IN LONG-TERM ASSETS WITHIN 365 DAYS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THE NET PROCEEDS  (OR ENTER INTO BINDING COMMITMENTS TO DO SO WITHIN SUCH PERIOD, AND THEREAFTER REINVEST SUCH PROCEEDS WITHIN 180 DAYS)  .  ANY PROCEEDS NOT REINVESTED AT THE END OF SUCH PERIOD WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE USED TO REDUCE OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT.  THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF OUR INDUSTRIAL STORAGE TANK AND PIPE FABRICATION BUSINESSES ARE PRIMARILY INCLUDED WITHIN OUR NCSA, MENA AND APAC OPERATING GROUPS.  49  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REVENUES FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL STORAGE TANK BUSINESS AS A  PERCENTAGE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED R  EVENUES WER  E APPROXIMATELY 11% AND 8%  FOR  THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30  , 2019 AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  ,  RESPECTIVELY.  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL STORAGE TANK BUSINESS AS A  PERCENTAGE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED P  ROPERTY, PLANT AND EQ  UI  PMEN  T, NET WAS APPROXIMATELY  6% AND  3% AS OF JUNE 30  , 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  OPERATING INCOME, INCLUDING  THE ALLOCATION OF THE CORRESPONDING INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION  ,  FOR OUR INDUSTRIAL STORAGE TANK BUSINESS  WAS $26  MILLION AND $69  MILLION  FOR  THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30  , 2019 AND YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  ,  RESPECTIVELY.  REVENUES FOR OUR PIPE FABRICATION BUSINESS AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES WERE LESS THAN 1% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 1% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET FOR OUR PIPE FABRICATION BUSINESS AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET WAS APPROXIMATELY 5% AND 6% AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OPERATING RESULTS FOR OUR PIPE FABRICATION BUSINESS WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  WE HAVE NOT INCLUDED TOTAL ASSETS OF THE TWO BUSINESSES IN THE ABOVE DISCUSSION, AS THE ALLOCATION OF GOODWILL RESULTING FROM THE COMBINATION TO THESE BUSINESSES HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, WE HAVE ALLOCATED OUR GOODWILL AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL. SIMILAR TO OUR DISPOSAL OF APP, IF WE COMPLETE THE PLANNED DISPOSITIONS OF THE REMAINING PIPE FABRICATION BUSINESS AND STORAGE TANKS BUSINESS, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO ALLOCATE GOODWILL FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING AND RECORDING ANY GAIN OR LOSS ON SALE.  WE EXPECT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE REMAINING GOODWILL OF OUR NCSA SEGMENT WILL BE ALLOCATED TO THE STORAGE TANKS BUSINESS FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING ITS CARRYING VALUE.  RPOS  RPOS REPRESENT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES WE EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE IN THE FUTURE FROM OUR CONTRACT COMMITMENTS ON PROJECTS. RPOS INCLUDE THE ENTIRE EXPECTED REVENUE VALUES FOR JOINT VENTURES WE CONSOLIDATE AND OUR PROPORTIONATE VALUES FOR CONSORTIUMS WE PROPORTIONATELY CONSOLIDATE. WE DO NOT INCLUDE EXPECTED REVENUES OF CONTRACTS RELATED TO UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES IN OUR RPOS, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT OF ANY SUBCONTRACT AWARDS WE RECEIVE FROM THOSE JOINT VENTURES.  RPOS FOR EACH OF OUR SEGMENTS CAN CONSIST OF UP TO SEVERAL HUNDRED CONTRACTS. THESE CONTRACTS VARY IN SIZE FROM LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CONTRACT VALUE TO SEVERAL BILLION DOLLARS, WITH VARYING DURATIONS THAT CAN EXCEED FIVE YEARS. THE TIMING OF AWARDS AND DIFFERING TYPES, SIZES AND DURATIONS OF OUR CONTRACTS, COMBINED WITH THE GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AND STAGES OF COMPLETION OF THE ASSOCIATED PROJECTS, OFTEN RESULTS IN FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY SEGMENT RESULTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE. RPOS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS, AND PROJECTS IN OUR RPOS MAY BE CANCELLED, MODIFIED OR OTHERWISE ALTERED BY CUSTOMERS. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR CONTRACTS REFLECTED IN RPOS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OUR ESTIMATES OF PROFIT COULD INCREASE OR DECREASE BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN PRODUCTIVITY, ACTUAL DOWNTIME AND THE RESOLUTION OF CHANGE ORDERS AND CLAIMS WITH THE CUSTOMERS, AND THEREFORE OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.  THE TIMING OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE CONTRACTING STRUCTURE OF OUR CONTRACTS. UNDER FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS, WE PERFORM OUR SERVICES AND EXECUTE OUR PROJECTS AT AN ESTABLISHED PRICE. FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS, AND HYBRID CONTRACTS WITH A MORE SIGNIFICANT FIXED-PRICE COMPONENT, TEND TO PROVIDE US WITH GREATER CONTROL OVER PROJECT SCHEDULE AND THE TIMING OF WHEN WORK IS PERFORMED AND COSTS ARE INCURRED, AND, ACCORDINGLY, WHEN REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. UNDER COST-REIMBURSABLE CONTRACTS, WE GENERALLY PERFORM OUR SERVICES IN EXCHANGE FOR A PRICE THAT CONSISTS OF REIMBURSEMENT OF ALL CUSTOMER-APPROVED COSTS AND A PROFIT COMPONENT, WHICH IS TYPICALLY A FIXED RATE PER HOUR, AN OVERALL FIXED FEE OR A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REIMBURSABLE COSTS. COST-REIMBURSABLE CONTRACTS, AND HYBRID CONTRACTS WITH A MORE SIGNIFICANT COST-REIMBURSABLE COMPONENT, GENERALLY PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH GREATER INFLUENCE OVER THE TIMING OF WHEN WE PERFORM OUR WORK, AND, ACCORDINGLY, SUCH CONTRACTS OFTEN RESULT IN LESS PREDICTABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION. OUR SHORTER-TERM CONTRACTS AND SERVICES ARE GENERALLY PROVIDED ON A COST-REIMBURSABLE, FIXED-PRICE OR UNIT PRICE BASIS.

ANY PROCEEDS NOT REINVESTED AT THE END OF SUCH PERIOD WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE USED TO REDUCE OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT FUNDING SOURCES WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE, AS OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AND UNCOMMITTED BILATERAL LINES OF CREDIT, OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS AND OUR ABILITY TO SELL NON-CORE ASSETS, AT REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL, MAY BE IMPACTED BY A VARIETY OF BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, LEGISLATIVE, FINANCIAL AND OTHER FACTORS, WHICH MAY BE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL.

EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH  \u2014DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH BALANCE DECREASED BY $2 MILLION, DUE TO THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR FOR NON-U.S. DOLLAR CASH BALANCES, PRIMARILY FOR NET CHANGES IN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR, AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR, BRITISH POUND AND EURO EXCHANGE RATES.

OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH HELD IN NON-U.S. DOLLAR CURRENCIES ARE USED PRIMARILY FOR PROJECT-RELATED AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENDITURES IN THOSE CURRENCIES, AND, THEREFORE, OUR EXPOSURE TO REALIZED EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES IS NOT ANTICIPATED TO BE MATERIAL.

WE ARE ENTITLED TO AN INDEMNITY FROM CSVC FOR BOTH THE SURETY BONDS AND GUARANTEES.  FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATION  OUR SIGNIFICANT FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATION IS AS FOLLOWS.  THE  AMAZON  , A PIPELAY AND CONSTRUCTION VESSEL, WAS PURCHASED BY US IN FEBRUARY 2017, SOLD TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY (THE \u201cAMAZON OWNER\u201d) AND LEASED BACK UNDER A LONG-TERM BAREBOAT CHARTER THAT GAVE US THE RIGHT TO USE THE VESSEL AND WAS RECORDED AS AN OPERATING  69  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  LEASE. ON JULY 27, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS (THE \u201cAMAZON MODIFICATION AGREEMENTS\u201d) PROVIDING FOR CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS TO THE  AMAZON  VESSEL AND RELATED FINANCING AND AMENDED BAREBOAT CHARTER ARRANGEMENTS. THE TOTAL COST OF THE MODIFICATIONS, INCLUDING PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES AND EXPENSES, IS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE RANGE OF APPROXIMATELY $260 MILLION TO $290 MILLION. THE AMAZON OWNER IS EXPECTED TO FUND THE COST OF THE MODIFICATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH AN EXPORT CREDIT-BACKED SENIOR LOAN PROVIDED BY A GROUP OF LENDERS, SUPPLEMENTED BY EXPECTED DIRECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY US OF APPROXIMATELY $58 MILLION OVER THE COURSE OF THE MODIFICATIONS. THE AMENDED BAREBOAT CHARTER ARRANGEMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A FINANCE LEASE, RECOGNIZING PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND LEASE OBLIGATION FOR THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS. THE COST OF MODIFICATIONS WILL BE RECORDED IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY FOR DIRECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES NOT INCURRED BY US. THE FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATION WILL INCREASE UPON COMPLETION OF THE MODIFICATIONS AND FUNDING BY THE AMAZON OWNER. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET INCLUDED A $50 MILLION ASSET (NET OF ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION OF $6 MILLION) AND A FINANCE LEASE LIABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET INCLUDED A $52 MILLION ASSET (NET OF ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION OF $3 MILLION) AND A FINANCE LEASE LIABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY $53 MILLION.  REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK  ON NOVEMBER 29, 2018 (THE \u201cCLOSING DATE\u201d), WE COMPLETED A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF (1) 300,000 SHARES OF 12% REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK, PAR VALUE $1.00 PER SHARE (THE \u201cREDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK\u201d), AND (2) SERIES A WARRANTS (THE \u201cWARRANTS\u201d) TO PURCHASE APPROXIMATELY 6.8 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WITH AN INITIAL EXERCISE PRICE PER SHARE OF $0.01, FOR AGGREGATE PROCEEDS OF $289.5 MILLION, BEFORE PAYMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $18 MILLION OF DIRECTLY RELATED ISSUANCE COSTS.  REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK  \u2014THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK WILL INITIALLY HAVE AN ACCRETED VALUE (AS DEFINED IN THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATION WITH RESPECT TO THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK (THE \u201cCERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATION\u201d)) OF $1,000.00 PER SHARE. THE HOLDERS OF THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE CUMULATIVE COMPOUNDING PREFERRED CASH DIVIDENDS QUARTERLY IN ARREARS AT A FIXED RATE OF 12.0% PER ANNUM COMPOUNDED QUARTERLY (OF WHICH 3.0% ACCRUES EACH QUARTER) ON THE ACCRETED VALUE PER SHARE (THE  \u201c  DIVIDEND RATE  \u201d  ). THE CASH DIVIDENDS ARE PAYABLE ONLY WHEN, AS AND IF DECLARED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS OUT OF FUNDS LEGALLY AVAILABLE FOR PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. IF A CASH DIVIDEND IS NOT DECLARED AND PAID IN RESPECT OF ANY DIVIDEND PAYMENT PERIOD ENDING ON OR PRIOR TO DECEMBER 31, 2021, THEN THE ACCRETED VALUE OF EACH OUTSTANDING SHARE OF REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE INCREASED BY THE AMOUNT OF THE DIVIDEND OTHERWISE PAYABLE FOR SUCH DIVIDEND PAYMENT PERIOD, EXCEPT THE APPLICABLE DIVIDEND RATE FOR THIS PURPOSE IS 13.0% PER ANNUM. SUCH AUTOMATIC INCREASE IN THE ACCRETED VALUE OF EACH OUTSTANDING SHARE OF REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK WOULD BE IN FULL SATISFACTION OF THE PREFERRED DIVIDEND THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE ACCRUED FOR SUCH DIVIDEND PAYMENT PERIOD. OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED, AND WE PAID CASH DIVIDENDS ON THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK ON THE FIRST DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE (DECEMBER 31, 2018), BUT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DID NOT DECLARE CASH DIVIDENDS ON THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK ON THE MARCH 31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2019 DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATES AND, AS A RESULT, THE ACCRETED VALUE OF THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK WAS INCREASED BY THE AMOUNT OF  THE ACCRUED BUT UNPAID DIVIDEND (I.E., A PAID-IN-KIND (\u201cPIK\u201d) DIVIDEND).  THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK HAS NO STATED MATURITY AND WILL REMAIN OUTSTANDING INDEFINITELY UNLESS REPURCHASED OR REDEEMED BY US.  THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK WILL HAVE A LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE EQUAL TO THE THEN APPLICABLE MINIMUM RETURN (THE  \u201c  LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE  \u201d  ) PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID DIVIDENDS. THE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE WILL INITIALLY BE EQUAL TO $1,200.00 PER SHARE. THE  \u201c  MINIMUM RETURN  \u201d  IS EQUAL TO A MULTIPLE OF INVESTED CAPITAL (\u201cMOIC\u201d) (AS DEFINED IN THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATION) AS FOLLOWS, EXCLUSIVE OF CASH DIVIDENDS PREVIOUSLY PAID.  \u2022  PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2020, A MOIC MULTIPLE OF 1.2;  \u2022  ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2020 BUT PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2022, A MOIC MULTIPLE OF 1.25;  \u2022  ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2022 BUT PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2023, A MOIC MULTIPLE OF 1.20;  \u2022  ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2023 BUT PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2025, A MOIC MULTIPLE OF 1.15; AND  \u2022  ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2025, A MOIC MULTIPLE OF 1.20.  WE MAY REDEEM THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK AT ANY TIME FOR AN AMOUNT PER SHARE OF REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK EQUAL TO THE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF EACH SUCH SHARE PLUS ALL ACCRUED DIVIDENDS ON SUCH SHARE (SUCH AMOUNT PER SHARE, THE  \u201c  REDEMPTION CONSIDERATION  \u201d  ).  AT ANY TIME AFTER THE SEVENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE, EACH HOLDER MAY ELECT TO HAVE US FULLY REDEEM SUCH HOLDER  \u2019  S THEN OUTSTANDING REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK IN CASH, TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE FUNDS LEGALLY AVAILABLE FOR PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AT A REDEMPTION PRICE PER SHARE EQUAL TO THE REDEMPTION CONSIDERATION FOR EACH SHARE.  70  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL (AS DEFINED IN THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATION), IF WE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY REDEEMED THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK AND THE HOLDERS OF A MAJORITY OF THE THEN-OUTSTANDING REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK DO NOT AGREE WITH US TO AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT, THEN IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH CHANGE OF CONTROL, EACH HOLDER MAY ELECT EITHER: (1) TO CAUSE US TO REDEEM ALL, BUT NOT LESS THAN ALL, OF ITS OUTSTANDING REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK AT A REDEMPTION PRICE PER SHARE EQUAL TO THE REDEMPTION CONSIDERATION, WHICH WOULD BE PAYABLE IN FULL IN CASH OR, IF ANY OF THE SENIOR NOTES ARE THEN OUTSTANDING, PAYABLE PARTIALLY IN CASH IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO 101% OF THE SHARE PURCHASE PRICE (AS DEFINED IN THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATION) (OR SUCH LOWER AMOUNT AS MAY BE REQUIRED UNDER THE SENIOR NOTES INDENTURE) AND THE REMAINDER IN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK BASED ON A PER SHARE PRICE EQUAL TO 96% OF THE VOLUME-WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE DURING THE 10 TRADING DAYS PRIOR TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF SUCH CHANGE OF CONTROL; (2) TO RECEIVE A SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT SECURITY TO THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK IN THE SURVIVING ENTITY OF THE CHANGE OF CONTROL; OR (3) TO CONTINUE TO HOLD THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK IF WE ARE THE SURVIVING ENTITY IN THE CHANGE OF CONTROL. HOWEVER, ANY SUCH REDEMPTION IN CASH WILL BE TOLLED UNTIL A DATE THAT WILL NOT RESULT IN THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK BEING CHARACTERIZED AS  \u201c  DISQUALIFIED STOCK,  \u201d  \u201c  DISQUALIFIED EQUITY INTEREST  \u201d  OR A SIMILAR CONCEPT UNDER OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS.  THE FAIR VALUE UPON ISSUANCE REPRESENTED THE NET IMPACT OF $289.5 MILLION OF AGGREGATE PROCEEDS, LESS $18 MILLION OF FEES AND $43 MILLION OF FAIR VALUE ASSIGNED TO THE WARRANTS DESCRIBED BELOW (SEPARATELY INCLUDED WITHIN CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF PAR VALUE IN OUR BALANCE SHEET).  THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT UPON ISSUANCE WAS BASED ON INPUTS THAT WERE NOT OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET AND THUS REPRESENTED LEVEL 3 INPUTS.  WE WILL RECORD ACCRETION AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS (DEFICIT) OVER THE SEVEN YEARS FROM THE CLOSING DATE THROUGH THE EXPECTED REDEMPTION DATE OF NOVEMBER 29, 2025 USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD. FROM THE CLOSING DATE THROUGH JUNE 30, 2019, WE RECORDED CUMULATIVE ACCRETION OF APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION WITH RESPECT TO THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION AND $8 MILLION DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK BALANCE WAS $257 MILLION,  ADJUSTED FOR ACCRETION AND PIK DIVIDENDS OF APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION. DURING 2018, APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION OF CASH DIVIDENDS WERE PAID TO THE HOLDERS OF THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK.  WARRANTS  \u2014THE WARRANTS ARE EXERCISABLE AT ANY TIME AFTER THE EARLIER OF (1) ANY CHANGE OF CONTROL OR THE COMMENCEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS FOR THE VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY DISSOLUTION, LIQUIDATION OR WINDING UP OF US AND (2) THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE, AND FROM TIME TO TIME, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, UNTIL THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE.  THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  OF THE WARRANTS  WAS BASED ON  THE MARKET-OBSERVABLE FAIR VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK  UPON ISSUANCE AND THUS REPRESENTED A LEVEL 1 INPUT.  THE EXERCISE PRICE AND THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR WHICH A WARRANT IS EXERCISABLE ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FROM TIME TO TIME UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS INCLUDING: (1) PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION TO HOLDERS OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK PAYABLE IN COMMON STOCK, (2) THE DISTRIBUTION OF ANY RIGHTS, OPTIONS OR WARRANTS TO ALL HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK ENTITLING THEM FOR A PERIOD OF NOT MORE THAN 60 DAYS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE PER SHARE LESS THAN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE PER SHARE, (3) A SUBDIVISION, COMBINATION, OR RECLASSIFICATION OF OUR COMMON STOCK, (4) A DISTRIBUTION TO ALL HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK OF CASH, ANY SHARES OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK (OTHER THAN OUR COMMON STOCK), EVIDENCES OF INDEBTEDNESS OR OTHER ASSETS OF OURS, AND (5) ANY DIVIDEND OF SHARES OF A SUBSIDIARY OF OURS IN A SPIN-OFF TRANSACTION.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  AS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC GROWTH PROGRAM, OUR MANAGEMENT REGULARLY EVALUATES OUR MARINE VESSEL FLEET AND OUR FABRICATION YARD CONSTRUCTION CAPACITY TO ENSURE OUR FLEET AND CONSTRUCTION CAPABILITIES ARE ADEQUATELY ALIGNED WITH OUR OVERALL GROWTH STRATEGY. THESE ASSESSMENTS MAY RESULT IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO CONSTRUCT, UPGRADE, ACQUIRE OR OPERATE VESSELS OR ACQUIRE OR UPGRADE FABRICATION YARDS THAT WOULD ENHANCE OR GROW OUR TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES, OR MAY INVOLVE ENGAGING IN DISCUSSIONS TO DISPOSE OF CERTAIN MARINE VESSELS OR FABRICATION YARDS.  71  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  CAPITAL EXP  ENDITURES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2019 AND 2018 WERE $33  MILLION AND $43  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,  AND WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO  OUR VESSEL  UPGRADES (INCLUDING UPGRADES TO THE  AMAZON  ) AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES.  OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE SECOND QUARTER INCLUDED EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR NEW ADMINISTRATIVE HEADQUARTERS IN HOUSTON, TEXAS.  DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019, WE EXPECT TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY $112 MILLION FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS, SUCH AS OUR NEW ADMINISTRATIVE HEADQUARTERS AND VARIOUS VESSEL UPGRADES AND CAPITAL MAINTENANCE PROJECTS.  OTHER  SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT  \u2015WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SEC IN SEPTEMBER 2018. THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT BECAME EFFECTIVE AUTOMATICALLY AND IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN SEPTEMBER 2021. THE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ENABLES US TO OFFER AND SELL SHARES OF OUR COMMON OR PREFERRED STOCK AND ISSUE DEBT OR OTHER SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME.  OTHER  \u2015A PORTION OF OUR PENSION PLANS\u2019 ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN EU GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, WHICH COULD BE IMPACTED BY ECONOMIC TURMOIL IN EUROPE OR A FULL OR PARTIAL BREAK-UP OF THE EU OR ITS CURRENCY, THE EURO. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF PENSION FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, IN THE EVENT ANY OF OUR PENSION PLANS (INCLUDING THOSE WITH INVESTMENTS IN EU GOVERNMENT SECURITIES) BECOME MATERIALLY UNDERFUNDED FROM A DECLINE IN VALUE OF OUR PLAN ASSETS, WE BELIEVE OUR CASH ON HAND AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND ANY INCREASES IN FUTURE CONTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS.  WE ARE A DEFENDANT IN A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS ARISING IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, AND WE HAVE IN PLACE APPROPRIATE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THE TYPE OF WORK THAT WE PERFORM.

OVERVIEW  THE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (  \"  MD&A  \"  ) IS INTENDED TO HELP THE READER MORE FULLY UNDERSTAND THE OPERATIONS AND PRESENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OF USA TRUCK INC.  MD&A IS PROVIDED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO, AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH, THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT APPEARS ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.  THIS OVERVIEW SUMMARIZES THE MD&A, WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS.  OUR BUSINESS  \u2013 A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS, THE ORGANIZATION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND THE SERVICE OFFERINGS THAT COMPRISE OUR OPERATIONS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \u2013 AN ANALYSIS OF THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS FILING AND A DISCUSSION OF SEASONALITY, THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF INFLATION AND FUEL AVAILABILITY AND COST.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  \u2013 AN ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOWS, SOURCES AND USES OF CASH, DEBT, EQUITY AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.  OUR BUSINESS  USA TRUCK OFFERS A BROAD RANGE OF TRUCKLOAD MOTOR CARRIER AND FREIGHT BROKERAGE AND LOGISTICS SERVICES TO A DIVERSIFIED CUSTOMER BASE THAT SPANS A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES.  THE COMPANY HAS TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: (I) TRUCKING, CONSISTING OF ONE-WAY TRUCKLOAD MOTOR CARRIER SERVICES, IN WHICH VOLUMES TYPICALLY ARE NOT CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED, AND DEDICATED CONTRACT MOTOR CARRIER SERVICES, IN WHICH A COMBINATION OF EQUIPMENT AND DRIVERS IS CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED TO A PARTICULAR CUSTOMER, TYPICALLY FOR A DURATION OF AT LEAST ONE YEAR, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CANCELLATION RIGHTS, AND (II) USAT LOGISTICS, CONSISTING OF FREIGHT BROKERAGE, LOGISTICS, AND RAIL INTERMODAL SERVICE OFFERINGS.  THE TRUCKING SEGMENT PROVIDES ONE-WAY TRUCKLOAD TRANSPORTATION, INCLUDING DEDICATED SERVICES, OF VARIOUS PRODUCTS, GOODS AND MATERIALS.  THE TRUCKING SEGMENT PRIMARILY USES ITS OWN PURCHASED OR LEASED TRACTORS AND TRAILERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS AND IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS \"ASSET-BASED\" TRUCKING.  THE COMPANY'S USAT LOGISTICS SERVICES MATCH CUSTOMER SHIPMENTS WITH AVAILABLE EQUIPMENT OF AUTHORIZED THIRD-PARTY MOTOR CARRIERS AND OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS AND PROVIDE SERVICES THAT COMPLEMENT THE COMPANY'S TRUCKING OPERATIONS.  USAT LOGISTICS PROVIDES THESE SERVICES PRIMARILY TO EXISTING TRUCKING CUSTOMERS, MANY OF WHOM PREFER TO RELY ON A SINGLE SERVICE PROVIDER, OR A SMALL GROUP OF SERVICE PROVIDERS, TO PROVIDE ALL THEIR TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS.  REVENUE FOR THE COMPANY'S TRUCKING SEGMENT IS SUBSTANTIALLY GENERATED BY TRANSPORTING FREIGHT FOR CUSTOMERS, AND IS PREDOMINANTLY AFFECTED BY THE RATES PER MILE RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS, THE NUMBER OF TRACTORS IN OPERATION, AND THE NUMBER OF REVENUE-GENERATING MILES PER TRACTOR.  THE COMPANY SUPPLEMENTS ITS TRUCKING OPERATING REVENUE BY CHARGING FOR FUEL SURCHARGE AND ANCILLARY SERVICES SUCH AS STOP-OFF CHARGES, LOADING AND UNLOADING ACTIVITIES, TRACTOR AND TRAILER DETENTION, EXPEDITED CHARGES, REPOSITIONING CHARGES AND OTHER SIMILAR SERVICES.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OPERATING EXPENSES THAT HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF THE TRUCKING SEGMENT FALL INTO TWO CATEGORIES: VARIABLE AND FIXED.  VARIABLE COSTS, OR MOSTLY VARIABLE COSTS, CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSPORTING FREIGHT FOR CUSTOMERS, AND INCLUDE DRIVER WAGES AND BENEFITS, FUEL AND FUEL TAXES, PAYMENTS TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS FOR PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION, OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE AND INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE.  THESE COSTS VARY PRIMARILY ACCORDING TO MILES OPERATED, BUT ALSO HAVE CONTROLLABLE COMPONENTS BASED ON PERCENTAGE OF COMPENSATED MILES, SHOP AND DISPATCH EFFICIENCY, AND SAFETY AND CLAIMS EXPERIENCE.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FIXED COSTS, OR MOSTLY FIXED COSTS, INCLUDE THE CAPITAL COSTS OF OUR ASSETS (DEPRECIATION, RENT AND INTEREST), COMPENSATION OF NON-DRIVING EMPLOYEES AND PORTIONS OF INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSES.  THESE EXPENSES ARE PARTIALLY CONTROLLABLE THROUGH MANAGEMENT OF FLEET SIZE AND FACILITIES INFRASTRUCTURE, HEADCOUNT EFFICIENCY, AND OPERATING SAFELY.  FUEL AND FUEL TAX EXPENSE CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY WITH CHANGES IN DIESEL FUEL PRICES AND IS ONE OF OUR MOST VOLATILE VARIABLE EXPENSES.  TO MITIGATE THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO FUEL PRICE INCREASES, IT RECOVERS FROM ITS CUSTOMERS FUEL SURCHARGES THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE RECOUPED A MAJORITY OF THE INCREASED FUEL COSTS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CANNOT ASSURE THE RECOVERY LEVELS EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST WILL CONTINUE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY'S FUEL SURCHARGE PROGRAM MITIGATES SOME EXPOSURE TO RISING FUEL COSTS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO HAVE EXPOSURE TO INCREASING FUEL COSTS RELATED TO EMPTY MILES, OUT-OF-ROUTE MILES, FUEL INEFFICIENCY DUE TO ENGINE IDLE TIME AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE SURCHARGE PAID BY THE CUSTOMER IS INSUFFICIENT TO COMPENSATE FOR HIGHER FUEL COSTS, PARTICULARLY IN TIMES OF RAPIDLY INCREASING FUEL PRICES.  THE MAIN FACTORS THAT AFFECT FUEL SURCHARGE REVENUE ARE THE PRICE OF DIESEL FUEL AND THE NUMBER OF LOADED MILES.  THE FUEL SURCHARGE IS BILLED ON A LAGGING BASIS, MEANING THE COMPANY TYPICALLY BILLS CUSTOMERS IN THE CURRENT WEEK BASED ON THE PREVIOUS WEEK'S APPLICABLE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, OR DOE, INDEX.  THEREFORE, IN TIMES OF INCREASING FUEL PRICES, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOVER AS MUCH IN FUEL SURCHARGE REVENUE AS IT PAYS FOR FUEL.  IN PERIODS OF DECLINING PRICES, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.  THE KEY STATISTICS USED TO EVALUATE TRUCKING SEGMENT PERFORMANCE, NET OF FUEL SURCHARGE REVENUE, INCLUDE (I) BASE REVENUE PER AVAILABLE TRACTOR PER WEEK, (II) BASE REVENUE PER LOADED MILE, (III) LOADED MILES PER AVAILABLE TRACTOR PER WEEK, (IV) DEADHEAD PERCENTAGE, (V) AVERAGE LOADED MILES PER TRIP, (VI) AVERAGE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE TRACTORS AND (VII) ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO.  IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY'S LOADED MILES PER AVAILABLE TRACTOR PER WEEK, BASE REVENUE PER LOADED MILE AND DEADHEAD PERCENTAGE ARE AFFECTED BY INDUSTRY-WIDE FREIGHT VOLUMES, INDUSTRY-WIDE TRUCKING CAPACITY AND THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, WHICH FACTORS ARE MOSTLY BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL, AS WELL AS BY ITS SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS, SERVICE LEVELS AND EFFICIENCY OF ITS OPERATIONS, OVER WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT CONTROL.  THE USAT LOGISTICS SEGMENT IS NON-ASSET BASED AND IS DEPENDENT UPON SKILLED EMPLOYEES, INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND THIRD-PARTY CAPACITY PROVIDERS.  THE LARGEST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE USAT LOGISTICS SEGMENT IS PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE.  OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES, WAGES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.  THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE USAT LOGISTICS SEGMENT BY REVIEWING GROSS MARGIN (USAT LOGISTICS OPERATING REVENUE LESS PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE) AND THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE (USAT LOGISTICS OPERATING REVENUE LESS PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF USAT LOGISTICS OPERATING REVENUE).  THE GROSS MARGIN CAN BE IMPACTED BY THE RATES CHARGED TO CUSTOMERS AND THE COSTS OF SECURING THIRD-PARTY CAPACITY.  USAT LOGISTICS OFTEN ACHIEVES BETTER GROSS MARGINS DURING PERIODS OF IMBALANCE BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND THAN TIMES OF BALANCED SUPPLY AND DEMAND, ALTHOUGH PERIODS OF TRANSITION TO TIGHT CAPACITY ALSO CAN COMPRESS MARGINS.  WE PLAN TO CONTINUE OUR FOCUS ON IMPROVING RESULTS THROUGH DISCIPLINED NETWORK MANAGEMENT AND PRICING, ENHANCED PARTNERSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS, AND IMPROVED EXECUTION IN OUR DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS OUR ONGOING SAFETY INITIATIVES.  BY FOCUSING ON THESE KEY OBJECTIVES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT WILL MAKE PROGRESS ON ITS GOALS OF IMPROVING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND INCREASING STOCKHOLDER VALUE.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN DOLLARS AND PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATING REVENUE AND THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF THOSE ITEMS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.  SEE \"USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\", \"CONSOLIDATED RECONCILIATIONS\" AND \"SEGMENT RECONCILIATIONS\" BELOW FOR THE USES AND LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO AND OTHER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION  THE COMPANY USES THE TERMS \"ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO\", \"ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE\", AND \"ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)\" THROUGHOUT THIS MD&A.  ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO, ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE, AND ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS), AS DEFINED HERE, ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AS DEFINED BY THE SEC.  MANAGEMENT USES ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO, ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE, AND ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) AS SUPPLEMENTS TO THE COMPANY'S GAAP RESULTS IN EVALUATING CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS, AS DISCUSSED BELOW.  ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO IS CALCULATED AS OPERATING EXPENSES EXCLUDING SEVERANCE COSTS INCLUDED IN SALARIES, WAGES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER COSTS (REVERSAL), AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION RELATED INTANGIBLES, AND TRANSACTION COSTS RELATING TO ACQUISITION, NET OF FUEL SURCHARGE REVENUE, AS A PERCENTAGE OF OPERATING REVENUE EXCLUDING FUEL SURCHARGE REVENUE.  ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE IS DEFINED AS EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE PLUS THE PER SHARE IMPACT OF SEVERANCE COSTS INCLUDED IN SALARIES, WAGES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER COSTS, AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION RELATED INTANGIBLES, AND TRANSACTION COSTS RELATED TO ACQUISITION, PLUS OR MINUS THE PER SHARE TAX IMPACT OF THOSE ADJUSTMENTS USING A STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATE.  THE PER SHARE IMPACT OF EACH ITEM IS DETERMINED BY DIVIDING IT BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING.  ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) IS DEFINED AS OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) EXCLUDING SEVERANCE COSTS INCLUDED IN SALARIES, WAGES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, RESTRUCTURING, IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER COSTS, AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION RELATED INTANGIBLES, AND TRANSACTION COSTS RELATED TO ACQUISITION.  THE COMPANY'S CHIEF OPERATING DECISION-MAKER FOCUSES ON ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO, ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE AND ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) AS INDICATORS OF THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES REMOVING THE IMPACT OF THE ABOVE DESCRIBED ITEMS FROM THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AFFORDS A MORE CONSISTENT BASIS FOR COMPARING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ITS PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS AND OTHER USERS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES THEM THE SAME INFORMATION THAT WE USE INTERNALLY FOR PURPOSES OF ASSESSING OUR CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE ARE NOT SUBSTITUTES FOR OPERATING MARGIN OR ANY OTHER MEASURE DERIVED SOLELY FROM GAAP MEASURES.  THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO USING NON-GAAP MEASURES SUCH AS ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE.  ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE CAN MAKE AN EVALUATION OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE MORE CONSISTENT BECAUSE THESE MEASURES REMOVE ITEMS THAT, IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, DO NOT REFLECT ITS CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE, OTHER COMPANIES IN THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY MAY DEFINE ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE DIFFERENTLY.  AS A RESULT, IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO USE ADJUSTED OPERATING RATIO, ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE OR SIMILARLY NAMED NON-GAAP MEASURES THAT OTHER COMPANIES MAY USE, TO COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THOSE COMPANIES TO USA TRUCK'S PERFORMANCE.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF REGULATION S-K, RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES HAVE BEEN PROVIDED IN THE TABLES BELOW.

TRUCKING BASE REVENUE  (BEFORE INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATIONS) INCREASED 13.4% TO $83.4 MILLION, COMPARED TO $73.6 MILLION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  THE INCREASE IN OPERATING REVENUE WAS THE RESULT OF A 16.6% INCREASE IN AVERAGE NUMBER OF SEATED TRACTORS AND A 12.9% INCREASE IN TOTAL MILES DRIVEN AS A RESULT OF THE DAVIS TRANSFER ACQUISITION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY A 0.2% DECREASE IN BASE REVENUE PER LOADED MILE.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, TRUCKING OPERATING REVENUE (BEFORE INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATIONS) INCREASED 16.3% TO $191.4 MILLION, COMPARED TO $164.5 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018.  TRUCKING BASE REVENUE INCREASED 18.0% TO $166.6 MILLION, FROM $141.2 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE CHANGES IN OPERATING REVENUE AND BASE REVENUE RESULTED FROM A 20.7% INCREASE IN TRUCKING SHIPMENTS, WHICH FUELED A 12.0% INCREASE IN TOTAL MILES DRIVEN PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE DAVIS TRANSFER ACQUISITION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, A 5.4% INCREASE IN BASE REVENUE PER LOADED MILE AND A 10 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENT IN DEADHEAD PERCENTAGE.  TRUCKING OPERATING  INCOME  FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, TRUCKING REPORTED OPERATING INCOME OF $0.8 MILLION COMPARED TO $2.2 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THIS DECREASE WAS STEMMING FROM A 14.5% INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES AND A 0.2% DECREASE IN BASE REVENUE PER LOADED MILE, OFFSET BY THE 12.6% INCREASE IN OPERATING REVENUE (BEFORE INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATIONS) DISCUSSED ABOVE.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 44.8% TO $2.4 MILLION FROM $1.7 MILLION FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN 2018.  THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM THE 16.3% CHANGE IN OPERATING REVENUE DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN TOTAL MILES, ADDITIONAL SEATED TRACTORS THAT RESULTED FROM THE ACQUISITION OF DAVIS TRANSFER DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, AND 5.4% INCREASE IN BASE REVENUE PER LOADED MILE.  USAT LOGISTICS OPERATING REVENUE  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, USAT LOGISTICS OPERATING REVENUE (BEFORE INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATIONS) DECREASED 21.8% TO $39.6 MILLION COMPARED TO $50.6 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN OPERATING REVENUE WAS THE RESULT OF A 18.4% DECREASE IN REVENUE PER LOAD COMBINED WITH A 4.2% DECREASE IN LOAD VOLUME, RESULTING FROM A CHALLENGING FREIGHT ENVIRONMENT.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, OPERATING REVENUE DECREASED 16.8% TO $81.0 MILLION FROM $97.4 MILLION, FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN 2018, AS A RESULT OF THE 16.6% DECREASE IN REVENUE PER LOAD, PAIRED WITH A 0.3% DECREASE IN LOAD VOLUMES.

AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE 21.8% DECREASE IN OPERATING REVENUE (BEFORE INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATIONS), PAIRED WITH THE 4.2% DECREASE IN LOAD VOLUME CONTRIBUTED PRIMARILY TO THE DROP IN OPERATING INCOME.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 31.0% TO $3.5 MILLION FROM $5.0 MILLION FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN 2018.  THIS CHANGE WAS THE RESULT OF THE 16.8% DECREASE IN OPERATING REVENUE (BEFORE INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATIONS) MENTIONED ABOVE, DRIVEN BY THE DECREASE IN LOAD VOLUME AND REVENUE PER LOAD, OFFSET BY A 16.0% DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES (BEFORE INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATIONS).  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING EXPENSES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATING EXPENSES AND PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATING REVENUE, CONSOLIDATED BASE REVENUE AND THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF THOSE ITEMS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

(2)  CALCULATED AS FUEL AND FUEL TAXES, NET OF FUEL SURCHARGE REVENUE.  SALARIES, WAGES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS  THE INCREASES IN SALARIES, WAGES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPACT OF A DRIVER WAGE INCREASE GIVEN IN RECENT QUARTERS PAIRED WITH INCREASED TOTAL REVENUE MILES OF 12.9% AND 12.0%, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION OF DAVIS TRANSFER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018.  THE RATE OF COMPENSATION PAID TO COMPANY DRIVERS PER MILE HAS INCREASED IN RECENT PERIODS AND WE EXPECT THIS COST WILL INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS DUE TO DRIVER PAY INCREASES, THE MOST RECENT OF WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.  THIS EXPENSE ITEM WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE PERCENTAGE OF TRUCKING MILES OPERATED BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS INSTEAD OF COMPANY EMPLOYED DRIVERS.  FUEL AND FUEL TAXES  FUEL AND FUEL TAXES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF DIESEL FUEL EXPENSE FOR COMPANY-OWNED TRACTORS AND FUEL TAXES.  THE PRIMARY FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S FUEL EXPENSE ARE THE COST OF DIESEL FUEL, THE FUEL ECONOMY OF COMPANY EQUIPMENT AND THE NUMBER OF MILES DRIVEN BY COMPANY DRIVERS.  THE INCREASES IN FUEL AND FUEL TAXES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 IS THE RESULT OF THE 12.9% AND 12.0% INCREASES, RESPECTIVELY, IN TOTAL MILES DRIVEN WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, OFFSET BY A 2.3% DECREASE IN THE PRICE PER GALLON OF DIESEL FUEL.  THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE INCREASE IN REVENUE MILES WAS THE PURCHASE OF DAVIS TRANSFER DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018.  THE COMPANY HAS UNDERTAKEN FUEL EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES, SUCH AS INSTALLING TRAILER SKIRTS, IDLE CONTROL, MORE FUEL-EFFICIENT ENGINES AND IMPLEMENTING DRIVER TRAINING PROGRAMS, WHICH HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR FUEL EXPENSE ON A COST PER COMPANY TRACTOR MILE BASIS.  IN FUTURE PERIODS, MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THE COMPANY'S NET FUEL EXPENSE TO FLUCTUATE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS DIESEL FUEL PRICES, PERCENTAGE RECOVERED FROM FUEL SURCHARGE PROGRAMS, DEADHEAD PERCENTAGE, THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE GENERATED FROM INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THE SUCCESS OF FUEL EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE MANAGING ITS IDLE TIME AND TRUCK SPEEDS AND PARTNERING WITH CUSTOMERS TO ADJUST FUEL SURCHARGE PROGRAMS TO RECOVER A FAIR PORTION OF RISING FUEL COSTS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND  EQUIPMENT  RENT  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF DEPRECIATION FOR COMPANY-OWNED TRACTORS AND TRAILERS AND AMORTIZATION OF THOSE FINANCED WITH CAPITAL LEASES.  THE PRIMARY FACTORS AFFECTING THIS EXPENSE INCLUDE THE NUMBER AND AGE OF COMPANY TRACTORS AND TRAILERS, THE ACQUISITION COST OF NEW EQUIPMENT AND THE SALVAGE VALUES AND USEFUL LIVES ASSIGNED TO THE EQUIPMENT.  EQUIPMENT RENT EXPENSES ARE THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES.  THESE LARGELY FIXED COSTS FLUCTUATE AS A PERCENTAGE OF BASE REVENUE PRIMARILY WITH INCREASES AND DECREASES IN AVERAGE BASE REVENUE PER TRACTOR AND THE PERCENTAGE OF BASE REVENUE CONTRIBUTED BY TRUCKING VERSUS USAT LOGISTICS.  FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, EQUIPMENT RENT EXPENSE INCREASED 19.4% AND 8.6% IN TERMS OF DOLLARS SPENT, BUT REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT AS A PERCENTAGE OF BOTH OPERATING AND BASE REVENUE WHEN COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF BOTH OPERATING AND BASE REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, DUE IN PART TO THE DAVIS TRANSFER ACQUISITION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2018 AND LOWER REVENUES AS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY.  THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON IMPROVING ASSET UTILIZATION, MATCHING CUSTOMER DEMAND AND STRENGTHENING LOAD PROFITABILITY INITIATIVES.  FURTHER, THE ACQUISITION COSTS OF NEW REVENUE EQUIPMENT COULD INCREASE DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF IMPROVED SAFETY AND FUEL EFFICIENCY FEATURES.  AS A RESULT, MANAGEMENT EXPECTS TO SEE AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FROM NEW TRACTORS, AND EXPECTS EQUIPMENT RENT TO INCREASE AS THE USE OF OPERATING LEASES INCREASES.  INSURANCE AND CLAIMS  INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE CONSISTS OF INSURANCE PREMIUM AND EXPERIENCE EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS FOR THIRD-PARTY BODILY INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, CARGO DAMAGE AND OTHER CASUALTY EVENTS.  THE PRIMARY FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE ARE THE NUMBER OF MILES DRIVEN BY ITS COMPANY DRIVERS AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF ACCIDENTS, TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT FACTORS USED IN THE COMPANY'S ACTUARIAL DEVELOPMENTS IN PRIOR-YEAR CLAIMS, INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND SELF-INSURED AMOUNTS.  FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE INCREASED MORE THAN 30% IN EACH PERIOD AND INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF BOTH OPERATING AND BASE REVENUE COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR 2018 PERIODS.  THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE OPERATIONS OF DAVIS TRANSFER, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, AND INCREASED AUTO LIABILITY EXPENSES DURING THE QUARTER.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY EXPECTS INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE TO CONTINUE TO BE VARIABLE OVER THE LONG-TERM.  IN ADDITION, INSURANCE CARRIERS HAVE GENERALLY RAISED PREMIUMS FOR MANY BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THOSE IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY, AND THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE COULD INCREASE IF IT HAS A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE AT RENEWAL OR REPLACEMENT, OR THE COMPANY COULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO RAISE ITS SELF-INSURED RETENTION LEVELS OR DECREASE ITS AGGREGATE COVERAGE LIMITS.  OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE  OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF VEHICLE REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND OTHER COSTS.  OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES ARE PRIMARILY AFFECTED BY THE AGE OF THE COMPANY'S FLEET OF TRACTORS AND TRAILERS, THE NUMBER OF MILES DRIVEN IN A PERIOD AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, BY EFFICIENCY MEASURES IN THE COMPANY'S MAINTENANCE FACILITIES.  THE DECREASES IN OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 WAS THE RESULT OF MAINTENANCE COST SAVINGS STEMMING FROM THE PURCHASE OF NEW REVENUE EQUIPMENT, COMBINED WITH ONGOING COST SAVING INITIATIVES UNDERTAKEN BY MANAGEMENT.  PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION  PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION CONSISTS OF THE PAYMENTS THE COMPANY MAKES TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, RAILROADS AND THIRD-PARTY CARRIERS THAT HAUL LOADS BROKERED TO THEM BY THE COMPANY, INCLUDING FUEL SURCHARGE REIMBURSEMENT PAID TO SUCH PARTIES.  FOR BOTH THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE DECREASED DUE TO A SOFTENING SPOT MARKET, WHICH LEADS TO PRICE CONCESSIONS FROM THIRD PARTY CARRIERS.  LOSS (GAIN) ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, NET  DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, LOSS (GAIN) ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, NET, CHANGED UNFAVORABLY WHEN COMPARED TO THE GAINS IN THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM VOLATILITY IN THE USED EQUIPMENT MARKET, WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES MAY CONTINUE TO SHOW VARIABILITY IN 2019 AND BEYOND.  OTHER EXPENSES  THE INCREASES IN OTHER EXPENSES DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF INCREASED PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.  INTEREST EXPENSE  FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF DAVIS TRANSFER DURING THE FALL QUARTER OF 2018 AND NEW REVENUE EQUIPMENT.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS DEBT OUTSTANDING ON THE CREDIT FACILITY BY APPROXIMATELY $2.0 MILLION.  SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S CREDIT FACILITY.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 99.5% AND 24.4%, RESPECTIVELY.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 33.5% AND 25.7%, RESPECTIVELY.  THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, WHEN COMPARED TO THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 21%, IS PRIMARILY AFFECTED BY STATE INCOME TAXES, NET OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX EFFECT, AND PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH IS THE EFFECT OF THE PARTIALLY NON-DEDUCTIBLE PER DIEM PAY STRUCTURE FOR OUR DRIVERS.  DRIVERS MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE NON-TAXABLE PER DIEM PAY IN LIEU OF A PORTION OF THEIR TAXABLE WAGES.  THIS PER DIEM PROGRAM INCREASES THE COMPANY'S DRIVERS\u2019 NET PAY PER MILE, AFTER TAXES, WHILE DECREASING GROSS PAY, BEFORE TAXES.  PER DIEM PAY IS PARTIALLY NON-DEDUCTIBLE BY THE COMPANY UNDER CURRENT IRS REGULATIONS.  AS A RESULT, SALARIES, WAGES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS COSTS ARE SLIGHTLY LOWER AND EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES ARE HIGHER THAN THE STATUTORY RATE.  DUE TO THE PARTIALLY NON-DEDUCTIBLE EFFECT OF PER DIEM PAY, THE COMPANY'S TAX RATE WILL CHANGE BASED ON FLUCTUATIONS IN EARNINGS (LOSSES) AND IN THE NUMBER OF DRIVERS WHO ELECT TO RECEIVE THIS PAY STRUCTURE.  GENERALLY, AS PRETAX INCOME OR LOSS INCREASES, THE IMPACT OF THE DRIVER PER DIEM PROGRAM ON THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASES, BECAUSE AGGREGATE PER DIEM PAY BECOMES SMALLER IN RELATION TO PRETAX INCOME OR LOSS, WHILE IN PERIODS WHERE EARNINGS ARE AT OR NEAR BREAKEVEN THE IMPACT OF THE PER DIEM PROGRAM ON THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE CAN BE SIGNIFICANT. DUE TO THE EFFECT OF THE NON-DEDUCTIBLE PER DIEM PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY'S TAX RATE WILL FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS BASED ON FLUCTUATIONS IN EARNINGS (LOSSES) AND IN THE NUMBER OF DRIVERS WHO ELECT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PER DIEM PROGRAM.  WHEN THE RESULT OF THE EXPECTED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS NOT DEEMED RELIABLE AND DISTORTS THE INCOME TAX PROVISION FOR AN INTERIM PERIOD, THE COMPANY CALCULATES THE INCOME TAX PROVISION OR BENEFIT USING THE CUT-OFF METHOD, WHICH RESULTS IN AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OR BENEFIT BASED SOLELY ON THE YEAR-TO-DATE PRETAX INCOME OR LOSS AS ADJUSTED FOR PERMANENT DIFFERENCES ON A PRO RATA BASIS.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD THE COMPANY'S TAX RATE WAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY VESTING OF EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION AT A LOWER STOCK PRICE THAN THE PRICE AT WHICH IT WAS GRANTED, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE TO TAX EXPENSE AND THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  SEASONALITY  IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY, REVENUE TYPICALLY FOLLOWS A SEASONAL PATTERN FOR VARIOUS COMMODITIES AND CUSTOMER BUSINESSES.  PEAK FREIGHT DEMAND HAS HISTORICALLY OCCURRED IN THE MONTHS OF SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER.  AFTER THE DECEMBER HOLIDAY SEASON AND DURING THE REMAINING WINTER MONTHS, FREIGHT VOLUMES ARE TYPICALLY LOWER AS MANY CUSTOMERS REDUCE SHIPMENT LEVELS.  OPERATING EXPENSES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHER IN THE WINTER MONTHS DUE PRIMARILY TO DECREASED FUEL EFFICIENCY, INCREASED COLD WEATHER-RELATED MAINTENANCE COSTS OF REVENUE EQUIPMENT AND INCREASED INSURANCE AND CLAIMS COSTS ATTRIBUTED TO ADVERSE WINTER DRIVING CONDITIONS.  REVENUE CAN ALSO BE IMPACTED BY WEATHER, HOLIDAYS AND THE NUMBER OF BUSINESS DAYS THAT OCCUR DURING A GIVEN PERIOD, AS REVENUE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE AVAILABLE WORKING DAYS OF SHIPPERS.  INFLATION  MOST OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING EXPENSES ARE INFLATION SENSITIVE, AND AS SUCH, ARE NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO BE OFFSET THROUGH INCREASES IN REVENUE PER MILE AND COST CONTROL EFFORTS.  THE EFFECT OF INFLATION-DRIVEN COST INCREASES ON OVERALL OPERATING COSTS IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE GREATER FOR THE COMPANY THAN FOR ITS COMPETITORS.  FUEL AVAILABILITY AND COST  THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY IS DEPENDENT UPON THE AVAILABILITY OF FUEL. IN THE PAST, FUEL SHORTAGES OR INCREASES IN FUEL TAXES OR FUEL COSTS HAVE ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR PROFITABILITY AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTY IN MAINTAINING NECESSARY FUEL SUPPLIES, AND IN THE PAST HAS GENERALLY BEEN ABLE TO PARTIALLY OFFSET INCREASES IN FUEL COSTS AND FUEL TAXES THROUGH INCREASED FREIGHT RATES AND THROUGH A FUEL SURCHARGE THAT INCREASES INCREMENTALLY AS THE AVERAGE PRICE OF FUEL INCREASES ABOVE AN AGREED UPON BASELINE PRICE PER GALLON.  TYPICALLY, THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO FULLY RECOVER INCREASES IN FUEL PRICES THROUGH FREIGHT RATE INCREASES AND FUEL SURCHARGES, PRIMARILY BECAUSE THOSE ITEMS ARE NOT AVAILABLE WITH RESPECT TO EMPTY AND OUT-OF-ROUTE MILES AND IDLING TIME, FOR WHICH THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT RECEIVE COMPENSATION FROM CUSTOMERS.  ADDITIONALLY, MOST FUEL SURCHARGES ARE BASED ON THE AVERAGE FUEL PRICE AS PUBLISHED BY THE DOE FOR THE WEEK PRIOR TO THE SHIPMENT, MEANING THE COMPANY TYPICALLY BILLS CUSTOMERS IN THE CURRENT WEEK BASED ON THE PREVIOUS WEEK'S APPLICABLE INDEX.  ACCORDINGLY, IN TIMES OF INCREASING FUEL PRICES, THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOVER AS MUCH AS IT IS CURRENTLY PAYING FOR FUEL. IN PERIODS OF DECLINING PRICES, FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THE INVERSE IS TRUE.  OVERALL, AVERAGE DIESEL FUEL PRICES PER GALLON, AS REPORTED BY THE DOE, DECLINED 2.3% AND 1.2%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY LONG-TERM FUEL PURCHASE CONTRACTS, AND HAS NOT ENTERED INTO ANY FUEL HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS.  EQUITY  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY OF $84.0 MILLION AND TOTAL DEBT AND LEASE LIABILITIES INCLUDING CURRENT MATURITIES AND INSURANCE PREMIUM FINANCING, OF $192.7 MILLION, RESULTING IN A TOTAL DEBT, LESS CASH, TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION RATIO OF 69.6% COMPARED TO 66.2% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018.  PURCHASES AND COMMITMENTS  THE COMPANY ROUTINELY MONITORS EQUIPMENT ACQUISITION NEEDS AND ADJUSTS PURCHASE SCHEDULES FROM TIME TO TIME BASED ON ANALYSIS OF FACTORS SUCH AS NEW EQUIPMENT PRICES, THE CONDITION OF THE USED EQUIPMENT MARKET, DEMAND FOR FREIGHT SERVICES, PREVAILING INTEREST RATES, TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS, FUEL EFFICIENCY, EQUIPMENT DURABILITY, EQUIPMENT SPECIFICATIONS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED DRIVERS.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD $26.1 MILLION IN NONCANCELLABLE COMMITMENTS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF BOTH REVENUE AND NON-REVENUE EQUIPMENT.  WE ANTICIPATE FUNDING THESE COMMITMENTS WITH OPERATING AND FINANCING CASH FLOWS OR LEASES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  USA TRUCK\u2019S BUSINESS HAS REQUIRED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE, SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.  IN THE COMPANY'S TRUCKING SEGMENT, WHERE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ARE THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL, THE PRIMARY INVESTMENTS ARE IN NEW REVENUE EQUIPMENT AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, IN TECHNOLOGY AND WORKING CAPITAL.  IN THE COMPANY'S USAT LOGISTICS SEGMENT, WHERE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY MORE MODEST, THE PRIMARY INVESTMENTS ARE IN TECHNOLOGY AND WORKING CAPITAL. USA TRUCK'S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY HAVE BEEN FUNDS PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS, BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMPANY'S CREDIT FACILITY, SALES OF USED REVENUE EQUIPMENT, AND FINANCE AND OPERATING LEASES.  BASED ON EXPECTED FINANCIAL CONDITIONS, NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, RESULTS  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OF OPERATIONS AND RELATED NET CASH FLOWS AND OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY'S SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY TO BE ADEQUATE TO MEET CURRENT AND PROJECTED NEEDS.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS A SINGLE FINANCIAL COVENANT, WHICH REQUIRES A CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 1.0 TO 1.0 THAT IS TRIGGERED IN THE EVENT EXCESS AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FALLS BELOW 10% OF THE LENDERS' TOTAL COMMITMENTS.  ALSO, CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS REGARDING THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS, MAKE CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, PREPAY CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS, EXECUTE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS AND ENTER INTO CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS ARE TRIGGERED IN THE EVENT EXCESS AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FALLS BELOW 10% OF THE LENDERS' TOTAL COMMITMENTS.  LONG-TERM DEBT, FINANCING NOTES AND LEASE LIABILITIES INCREASED TO $192.7 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $32.2 MILLION FROM $160.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD $5.4 MILLION IN LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING AND HAD APPROXIMATELY $59.0 MILLION AVAILABLE TO BORROW UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT BORROWING BASE AVAILABILITY.  NET OF CASH, DEBT REPRESENTED 69.6% OF TOTAL CAPITALIZATION.  FLUCTUATIONS IN THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE AND RELATED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND THE TIMING AND NATURE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ADDITIONS THAT ARE NOT FUNDED THROUGH OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING, AS WELL AS THE NATURE AND TIMING OF RECEIPT OF PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSALS OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.  CASH FLOWS  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JUNE 30,  2019  2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $15,754  $18,428  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (17,871)  (1,522)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  1,326  (16,948)  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  \u2013 NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $2.7 MILLION IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A $10.3 MILLION INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLES PAIRED WITH A $2.1 MILLION DECREASE IN NET INCOME, OFFSET BY A $3.3 MILLION INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, A $3.6 MILLION INCREASE IN DEFERRED TAXES, A $2.1 MILLION INCREASE IN INVENTORIES, AND A $1.1 MILLION INCREASE IN SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  \u2013 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $17.9 MILLION, COMPARED TO $1.5 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THE $16.3 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A $20.9 MILLION INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE 2019 PERIOD, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $4.9 MILLION IN THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IN THE 2019 PERIOD COMPARED TO THE 2018 PERIOD.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  \u2013 CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $1.3 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $16.9 MILLION USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THE $18.3 MILLION CHANGE WAS DUE TO THE $10.5 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM A SALE LEASEBACK TRANSACTION COMPLETED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, INCREASED BORROWINGS OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $36.2 MILLION, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $28.9 MILLION IN PAYMENTS ON LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS.  AT JUNE 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD BORROWINGS OF LONG-TERM DEBT, FINANCING NOTES AND LEASE LIABILITIES OF $192.7 MILLION, UP FROM $160.5 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018.  DEBT AND LEASE OBLIGATIONS  SEE NOTES 8, 9, AND 10 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE FINANCING, CREDIT FACILITY AND LEASE OBLIGATIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES.  THE COMPANY BASES ITS ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT TRENDS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES TO BE RELEVANT AT THE TIME ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES, AND SUCH DIFFERENCES COULD BE MATERIAL.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, COMPARED TO THOSE DISCLOSED IN ITEM 7,  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \"MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\" INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "USA TRUCK INC", "CIK": 883945, "Date": "2019-07-30T00:00:00", "Ticker": "USAK", "Name": "USA Truck Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 4213.0, "Business": "AR", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 710556971.0, "key": "20190730USAK", "labelr1": -1.8137847642079852, "labelr2": -0.24630541871920655, "labelr3": 3.9506172839506206, "labelr4": -1.7814726840855148, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.8264306999999999, "prof1": 0.17356928, "return1&2": 1.0206455763308535, "return1&2&3": 0.9803237757844494, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9977879760656451, "return2": 1.0024630541871922, "return1": 1.01813784764208, "return3": 0.9604938271604938, "return4": 1.017814726840855, "1_day_return": -1.8137847642079816, "cumulative_return1": 0.3219989541640965, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.08301006284125455, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.004934414325544679, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0036647754069234796, "indexx": 1497, "cumreturn1b": 0.9677357227919436, "cumreturndow": 1.0024789263995786, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0028965830742644}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1547, "level_0": 3324, "index": 88751, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)  OVERVIEW  INTRODUCTION.
