WE REFER TO THE LAUNDRY LOCATIONS OF THE U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING REPORTING SEGMENT AS \u201cINDUSTRIAL LAUNDRIES\u201d OR \u201cINDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY LOCATIONS\u201d, AND TO THE U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING, MFG, AND CORPORATE REPORTING SEGMENTS COMBINED AS OUR \u201cCORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS.\u201d  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). AS SUCH, MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DEFINED AS THOSE THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES, THE MOST IMPORTANT AND PERVASIVE ACCOUNTING POLICIES USED AND AREAS MOST SENSITIVE TO MATERIAL CHANGES FROM EXTERNAL FACTORS. THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES THAT WE BELIEVE AFFECT OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT ARE DESCRIBED IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  AUGUST 25, 2018.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS CERTAIN SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA, INCLUDING THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES REPRESENTED BY EACH ITEM, FOR THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  AND  NOVEMBER 25, 2017.

GENERAL  WE DERIVE OUR REVENUES THROUGH THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, PERSONALIZATION, RENTAL, CLEANING, DELIVERING, AND SELLING OF A WIDE RANGE OF UNIFORMS AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING, INCLUDING SHIRTS, PANTS, JACKETS, COVERALLS, LAB COATS, SMOCKS AND APRONS AND SPECIALIZED PROTECTIVE WEAR, SUCH AS FLAME RESISTANT AND HIGH VISIBILITY GARMENTS. WE ALSO RENT INDUSTRIAL WIPING PRODUCTS, FLOOR MATS, FACILITY SERVICE PRODUCTS, OTHER NON-GARMENT ITEMS, AND PROVIDE RESTROOM AND CLEANING SUPPLIES AND FIRST AID CABINET SERVICES AND OTHER SAFETY SUPPLIES, TO A VARIETY OF MANUFACTURERS, RETAILERS AND SERVICE COMPANIES. WE HAVE FIVE REPORTING SEGMENTS, U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING, MFG, SPECIALTY GARMENTS, FIRST AID AND CORPORATE. WE REFER TO THE U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING, MFG, AND CORPORATE REPORTING SEGMENTS COMBINED AS OUR \u201cCORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS.\u201d  COST OF REVENUES INCLUDE THE AMORTIZATION OF RENTAL MERCHANDISE IN SERVICE AND MERCHANDISE COSTS RELATED TO DIRECT SALES AS WELL AS LABOR AND OTHER PRODUCTION, SERVICE AND DELIVERY COSTS, AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING OUR CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS, SPECIALTY GARMENTS FACILITIES, AND FIRST AID LOCATIONS. SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCLUDE COSTS RELATED TO OUR SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CORPORATE OFFICES, NON-OPERATING ENVIRONMENTAL SITES AND OPERATING LOCATIONS INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ENGINEERING, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT, MANUFACTURING PLANNING, FINANCE, BUDGETING, AND HUMAN RESOURCES.  WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PLANTS AND CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IN ENERGY PRODUCING REGIONS IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. IN GENERAL, WE ARE RELATIVELY MORE DEPENDENT ON BUSINESS IN THESE REGIONS THAN ARE MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DRAMATIC DECREASE IN OIL PRICES BEGINNING IN 2014 DIRECTLY AFFECTED OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY AS THEY CURTAILED THEIR LEVEL OF OPERATIONS, WHICH ALSO HAD A CORRESPONDING EFFECT ON OUR CUSTOMERS IN BUSINESSES WHICH SERVICE OR SUPPLY THE OIL INDUSTRY AS WELL AS OUR CUSTOMERS IN UNRELATED BUSINESSES LOCATED IN AREAS WHICH HAD BENEFITED FROM THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION GENERATED BY THE ROBUST GROWTH DRIVEN BY THE HIGHER OIL PRICES IN PRIOR YEARS. AS A RESULT, OUR ORGANIC GROWTH IN PERIODS FOLLOWING THIS DRAMATIC DECREASE IN OIL PRICES WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ELEVATED HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS IN OUR WEARER BASE AS WELL AS INCREASED LOST ACCOUNTS. RECENT TRENDS INDICATE THAT INCREASED ENERGY PRICES HAVE RESULTED IN STABILIZED OR IMPROVED WEARER LEVELS AT EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN OUR NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY-DEPENDENT MARKETS. OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE ALSO DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE COSTS OF THE GASOLINE USED TO FUEL OUR VEHICLES AND THE NATURAL GAS USED TO OPERATE OUR PLANTS. WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN ENERGY PRICES, IN GENERAL, WE BELIEVE THAT SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES WOULD HAVE AN OVERALL NEGATIVE  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS DUE TO CUTBACKS BY OUR CUSTOMERS BOTH IN, AND DEPENDENT UPON, THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRIES, WHICH WOULD OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS IN OUR OPERATING COSTS FROM LOWER ENERGY COSTS.  THE COST OF HEALTHCARE THAT WE PROVIDE TO OUR EMPLOYEES HAS GROWN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AT A RATE IN EXCESS OF OUR REVENUE GROWTH AND AS A RESULT, HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR OPERATING RESULTS. MOREOVER, IT IS GENERALLY EXPECTED THAT HEALTHCARE COSTS IN THE UNITED STATES WILL INCREASE OVER THE COMING YEARS AT RATES IN EXCESS OF INFLATION. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, AND DEPENDING ON THE EFFECT OF ANY MODIFICATIONS WE HAVE MADE, AND MAY MAKE IN THE FUTURE, TO OUR EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE PLANS AND ENROLLMENT LEVELS IN THOSE PLANS, WE EXPECT THAT OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE FURTHER ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY INCREASING HEALTHCARE COSTS.  OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS, INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENTS, OVERTIME REQUIREMENTS, WORKING CONDITION REQUIREMENTS, CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENTS, HEALTHCARE INSURANCE MANDATES AND OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IMPACT OUR LABOR COSTS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR LABOR COSTS WILL RISE IN FISCAL 2019 AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN STATE AND LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE LEVELS AS WELL AS THE OVERALL IMPACT OF WAGE PRESSURE AS THE RESULT OF A LOW UNEMPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT.  ON JANUARY 2, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZING US TO REPURCHASE FROM TIME TO TIME UP TO $100.0 MILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.  REPURCHASES MADE UNDER THE PROGRAM, IF ANY, WILL BE MADE IN EITHER THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE TIMING, MANNER, PRICE AND AMOUNT OF ANY REPURCHASES WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR STOCK PRICE, CORPORATE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND PRIORITIES, APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL BE FUNDED USING OUR AVAILABLE CASH OR CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT WHEN IMPLEMENTED AND MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.  DURING FISCAL 2017, WE RECORDED A PRE-TAX NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $55.8 MILLION ONCE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED WOULD BE COMPLETED AND PLACED INTO SERVICE. ON DECEMBER 28, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR LEAD CONTRACTOR FOR THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO WHICH WE RECORDED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WE WILL RECORD A TOTAL GAIN OF $20.3 MILLION DURING THE QUARTER ENDING FEBRUARY 23, 2019, WHICH INCLUDES OUR RECEIPT OF A ONE-TIME CASH PAYMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF  $13.0 MILLION  AS WELL AS THE FORGIVENESS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY DUE THE CONTRACTOR.  IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER OF 2018, WE INITIATED A MULTIYEAR CRM PROJECT TO FURTHER DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND DEPLOY A THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION WE LICENSED. THIS NEW SOLUTION IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, CAPABILITY AND INFORMATION FLOW AS WELL AS INCREASE AUTOMATION IN SERVICING OUR CUSTOMERS. AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , WE HAVE CAPITALIZED $3.8 MILLION RELATED TO OUR NEW CRM PROJECT.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cACT\u201d) WAS ENACTED, WHICH, AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS, REDUCED THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 FROM A 35% RATE TO A NEW 21% CORPORATE RATE AND IMPOSED A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON EARNINGS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE MADE REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF THE EFFECTS OF THE ACT AND THESE ESTIMATES COULD CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS AS WE CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF THE ACT (SEE NOTE 13, \u201cINCOME TAXES\u201d TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q).  A PORTION OF OUR SALES IS DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, INCLUDING CANADA. REVENUES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  7.9%  AND  8.0%  OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FOR  THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  AND  NOVEMBER 25, 2017  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AND SUCH RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY  MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. IN ADDITION, FLUCTUATIONS IN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE MARGINS OF OUR CANADIAN BUSINESS BECAUSE A WEAKER CANADIAN DOLLAR WILL INCREASE THE COST OF MERCHANDISE AND OTHER OPERATIONAL INPUTS THAT ARE SOURCED FROM OUTSIDE OF CANADA. OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE YEARS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ANY DEVALUATION, AS COMPARED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, OF THE CANADIAN DOLLAR OR ANY OF THE CURRENCIES OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  COMPARED WITH THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 25, 2017  REVENUES  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  NOVEMBER 24,  2018  NOVEMBER 25,  2017  DOLLAR  CHANGE  PERCENT  CHANGE  CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS  $390,477  $373,796  $16,681  4.5%  SPECIALTY GARMENTS  34,448  28,427  6,021  21.2%  FIRST AID  13,625  13,555  70  0.5%  CONSOLIDATED TOTAL  $438,550  $415,778  $22,772  5.5%  THE  INCREASE  IN OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY FROM OUR CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS.

ORGANIC GROWTH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF NEW SALES, PRICING ADJUSTMENTS, AND NET CHANGES IN THE WEARER LEVELS AT OUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS, OFFSET BY LOST ACCOUNTS.  SPECIALTY GARMENTS\u2019 RESULTS ARE OFTEN AFFECTED BY SEASONALITY AND THE TIMING AND LENGTH OF ITS CUSTOMERS\u2019 POWER REACTOR OUTAGES AS WELL AS ITS PROJECT-BASED ACTIVITIES. EXCLUDING THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF ACQUISITIONS, WHICH WE ESTIMATE INCREASED OUR REVENUES IN THE SPECIALTY GARMENTS SEGMENT BY APPROXIMATELY 11.3%, THE IMPROVEMENT IN RESULTS IN THE SPECIALTY GARMENTS SEGMENT IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED OUTAGES AND PROJECT-BASED ACTIVITY AT THE SEGMENT\u2019S CANADIAN NUCLEAR CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS SOLID GROWTH FROM THE CLEANROOM DIVISION.

THE INCREASE IN COST OF REVENUES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER PRODUCTION AND SERVICE AND DELIVERY PAYROLL COSTS AS WELL AS HIGHER MERCHANDISE COSTS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER HEALTHCARE CLAIMS.

LONG-TERM DEBT AND BORROWING CAPACITY  WE HAVE A $250 MILLION  UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH A SYNDICATE OF BANKS, WHICH MATURES ON  APRIL 11, 2021  . UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WE ARE ABLE TO BORROW FUNDS AT VARIABLE INTEREST RATES BASED ON, AT OUR ELECTION, THE EURODOLLAR RATE OR A BASE RATE, PLUS IN EACH CASE A SPREAD BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FUNDED DEBT RATIO. AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS, INCLUDING A MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED FUNDED DEBT RATIO AND MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. WE TEST OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS ON A FISCAL QUARTERLY BASIS. AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , THE INTEREST RATES APPLICABLE TO OUR BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WOULD BE CALCULATED AS LIBOR PLUS  75  BASIS POINTS AT THE TIME OF THE RESPECTIVE BORROWING.

THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE SPECIFIED AS THE FIRST AMOUNT OF CAD DENOMINATED REVENUES INVOICED BY ONE OF OUR DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES EACH FISCAL QUARTER, BEGINNING IN THE THIRD FISCAL QUARTER OF 2019 AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF 2022. IN TOTAL, WE WILL SELL APPROXIMATELY  12.1 MILLION  CAD AT AN AVERAGE CANADIAN-DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE OF  0.7814  OVER THESE QUARTERLY PERIODS. WE CONCLUDED THAT THE FORWARD CONTRACTS MET THE CRITERIA TO QUALIFY AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE UNDER U.S. GAAP.  AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , WE HAD FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH A NOTIONAL VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY  13.4 MILLION  CAD OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS OF  $0.2 MILLION  IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS AND  $0.1 MILLION  IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS WITH A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS OF  $0.2 MILLION  , WHICH WAS RECORDED NET OF TAX. DURING THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , WE RECLASSIFIED A NOMINAL AMOUNT FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS TO REVENUE, RELATED TO THE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE GAIN ON THESE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT RESULTED IN A DECREASE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  IS EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO REVENUES PRIOR TO ITS MATURITY ON  FEBRUARY 25, 2022.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AIR EMISSIONS, WASTEWATER DISCHARGES, AND THE GENERATION, HANDLING, STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTES AND OTHER SUBSTANCES. IN PARTICULAR, INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRIES CURRENTLY USE AND MUST DISPOSE OF DETERGENT WASTE WATER AND OTHER RESIDUES, AND, IN THE PAST, USED PERCHLOROETHYLENE AND OTHER DRY CLEANING SOLVENTS. WE ARE ATTENTIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS SURROUNDING THE DISPOSAL OF THESE MATERIALS AND HAVE, THROUGH THE YEARS, TAKEN MEASURES TO AVOID THEIR IMPROPER DISPOSAL. OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE SETTLED, OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF, ACTIONS OR CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US RELATING TO THE DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO EXPEND MATERIAL AMOUNTS TO REMEDIATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH DISPOSAL IN THE FUTURE.  U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR CONTINGENCIES BE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF A LIABILITY, AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT TO BE RECORDED. WE REGULARLY CONSULT WITH ATTORNEYS AND OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS IN OUR CONSIDERATION OF THE RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE RECORDING A CONTINGENT LIABILITY. CHANGES IN ENACTED LAWS, REGULATORY ORDERS OR DECREES, OUR ESTIMATES OF COSTS, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES, INSURANCE PROCEEDS, PARTICIPATION BY OTHER PARTIES, THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS, THE INPUT OF OUR ATTORNEYS AND OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS OR OTHER FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES.  UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, AN OWNER OR LESSEE OF REAL ESTATE MAY BE LIABLE FOR THE COSTS OF REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION OF CERTAIN HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES LOCATED ON, OR IN, OR EMANATING FROM SUCH PROPERTY, AS WELL AS RELATED COSTS OF INVESTIGATION AND PROPERTY DAMAGE. SUCH LAWS OFTEN IMPOSE LIABILITY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE OWNER OR LESSEE KNEW OF, OR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR, THE PRESENCE OF SUCH HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT ACQUIRED OR LEASED LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN OPERATED IN COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR THAT FUTURE USES OR CONDITIONS WILL NOT RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY UPON OUR COMPANY UNDER SUCH LAWS OR EXPOSE OUR COMPANY TO THIRD PARTY ACTIONS SUCH AS TORT SUITS. WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS UNDER TERMS OF CONSENT ORDERS NEGOTIATED WITH THE APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL AUTHORITIES OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO SITES LOCATED IN OR RELATED TO WOBURN, MASSACHUSETTS, SOMERVILLE, MASSACHUSETTS, SPRINGFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS, UVALDE, TEXAS, STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA,  TWO  SITES RELATED TO FORMER OPERATIONS IN WILLIAMSTOWN, VERMONT, AS WELL AS SITES LOCATED IN GOLDSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA AND WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA.  WE HAVE ACCRUED CERTAIN COSTS RELATED TO THE SITES DESCRIBED ABOVE AS IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE COSTS ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. WE HAVE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE RELATED TO A PARCEL OF LAND (THE \u201cCENTRAL AREA\u201d) RELATED TO THE WOBURN, MASSACHUSETTS SITE MENTIONED ABOVE. CURRENTLY, THE CONSENT DECREE FOR THE WOBURN SITE DOES NOT DEFINE OR REQUIRE ANY REMEDIATION WORK IN THE CENTRAL AREA. THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (THE \u201cEPA\u201d) HAS PROVIDED US AND OTHER SIGNATORIES TO THE CONSENT DECREE WITH COMMENTS ON THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF GROUNDWATER AND SOIL REMEDIES AT THE WOBURN SITE AND INVESTIGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN THE CENTRAL AREA. WE, AND OTHER SIGNATORIES, HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND PROPOSED TO DO ADDITIONAL WORK AT THE WOBURN SITE BUT MANY OF THE EPA\u2019S COMMENTS REMAIN TO BE RESOLVED. WE HAVE ACCRUED COSTS TO PERFORM CERTAIN WORK RESPONSIVE TO EPA\u2019S COMMENTS. WE  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HAVE IMPLEMENTED MITIGATION MEASURES AND CONTINUE TO MONITOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AT THE SOMERVILLE, MASSACHUSETTS SITE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RECEIVED DEMANDS FROM THE LOCAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW MUNICIPAL TRANSIT STATION IN THE AREA OF THE SOMERVILLE SITE. THIS STATION IS PART OF THE EXTENSION OF THE TRANSIT SYSTEM. WE HAVE RESERVED FOR COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS MATTER; HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MATTER, THESE COSTS AND THE RELATED RESERVE MAY CHANGE. WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED NOTICE THAT THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IS CONDUCTING AN AUDIT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION WORK WITH RESPECT TO THE SOMERVILLE SITE.  WE ROUTINELY REVIEW AND EVALUATE SITES THAT MAY REQUIRE REMEDIATION AND MONITORING AND DETERMINE OUR ESTIMATED COSTS BASED ON VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE DEVELOPED USING OUR INTERNAL SOURCES OR BY THIRD PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERS OR OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS. INTERNALLY DEVELOPED ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON.  \u2022  MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT AND EXPERIENCE IN REMEDIATING AND MONITORING OUR SITES;  \u2022  INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM REGULATORY AGENCIES AS TO COSTS OF REMEDIATION AND MONITORING;  \u2022  THE NUMBER, FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND RELATIVE DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY OF OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (\u201cPRPS\u201d) WHO MAY BE LIABLE FOR REMEDIATION AND MONITORING OF A SPECIFIC SITE; AND  \u2022  THE TYPICAL ALLOCATION OF COSTS AMONG PRPS.  THERE IS USUALLY A RANGE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH SITE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, OUR ACCRUALS REFLECT THE AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE THAT WE BELIEVE IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OR THE LOW END OF A RANGE OF ESTIMATES IF NO POINT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE. WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT BOTH THE AMOUNT OF A PARTICULAR LIABILITY AND THE TIMING OF THE PAYMENTS ARE RELIABLY DETERMINABLE, WE ADJUST THE COST IN CURRENT DOLLARS USING A RATE OF  3%  FOR INFLATION UNTIL THE TIME OF EXPECTED PAYMENT AND DISCOUNT THE COST TO PRESENT VALUE USING CURRENT RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES. AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES WE UTILIZED RANGED FROM  3.1%  TO  3.3%.  FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCOUNTED, WE INCLUDE INTEREST ACCRETION, BASED ON THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD, IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE CHANGES TO THE AMOUNTS OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES FOR THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).

ANNUAL PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION  ARE DEPOSITED INTO AN ESCROW ACCOUNT WHICH FUNDS REMEDIATION AND MONITORING COSTS FOR  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TWO  SITES RELATED TO OUR FORMER OPERATIONS IN WILLIAMSTOWN, VERMONT. ANNUAL PROCEEDS RECEIVED BUT NOT EXPENDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR ACCUMULATE IN THIS ACCOUNT AND MAY BE USED IN FUTURE YEARS FOR COSTS RELATED TO THIS SITE THROUGH THE YEAR 2027. AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , THE BALANCE IN THIS ESCROW ACCOUNT, WHICH IS HELD IN A TRUST AND IS NOT RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.8 MILLION  . ALSO INCLUDED IN ESTIMATED INSURANCE PROCEEDS ARE AMOUNTS WE ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PURSUANT TO LEGAL SETTLEMENTS AS REIMBURSEMENTS FROM THREE INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR ESTIMATED COSTS AT THE SITE IN UVALDE, TEXAS.  OUR NUCLEAR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION FACILITIES ARE LICENSED BY THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (\u201cNRC\u201d), OR, IN CERTAIN CASES, BY THE APPLICABLE STATE AGENCY, AND ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. WE ALSO HAVE NUCLEAR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION FACILITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE NETHERLANDS. THESE FACILITIES ARE LICENSED AND REGULATED BY THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRY\u2019S APPLICABLE FEDERAL AGENCY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH REGULATION WILL NOT LEAD TO MATERIAL DISRUPTIONS IN OUR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION BUSINESS.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, CUSTOMER CONTRACT MATTERS, EMPLOYMENT CLAIMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  WHILE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO ASCERTAIN THE ULTIMATE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, INCLUDING LAWSUITS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES, WE BELIEVE THAT THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SUCH LIABILITIES, IF ANY, IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS COVERED BY INSURANCE HAVE BEEN PROPERLY ACCRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT THE FUTURE FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR FUTURE PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE CONTINGENCIES OR CHANGES OUT OF OUR CONTROL.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGULATION S-K.  SEASONALITY  HISTORICALLY, OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS HAVE VARIED FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE. THESE FLUCTUATIONS HAVE BEEN DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING: GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN OUR MARKETS; THE TIMING OF ACQUISITIONS AND OF COMMENCING START-UP OPERATIONS AND RELATED COSTS; OUR EFFECTIVENESS IN INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND START-UP OPERATIONS; THE TIMING OF NUCLEAR PLANT OUTAGES; CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; SEASONAL RENTAL AND PURCHASING PATTERNS OF OUR CUSTOMERS; AND PRICE CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS. IN ADDITION, OUR OPERATING RESULTS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN LOWER DURING THE SECOND AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS THAN DURING THE OTHER QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY HISTORICAL QUARTER ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR AN ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR OR ANY OTHER INTERIM PERIODS.  EFFECTS OF INFLATION  IN GENERAL, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON MODERATE CHANGES IN THE INFLATION RATE. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE THE IMPACTS OF MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN INFLATION RATES THROUGH OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS THAT GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR PRICE INCREASES CONSISTENT WITH THE RATE OF INFLATION, AND CONTINUED FOCUS ON IMPROVEMENTS OF OPERATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT WERE DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  AUGUST 25, 2018.

SALES INCREASES WERE RECORDED OVER THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR TO CUSTOMERS INVOLVED  IN CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS AND BRIDGES (76%), AS WELL AS IN SALES TO CUSTOMERS IN AEROSPACE / DEFENSE (23%). THE SIGNIFICANT  INCREASE IN SALES TO CONSTRUCTION CUSTOMERS WAS THE RESULT OF SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING 1.) AN INCREASE IN DOMESTIC SPENDING ON  INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SEISMIC PROTECTION, AND 2.) AN INCREASE IN DOMESTIC BUILDINGS BEING RETROFITTED FOR SEISMIC PROTECTION.

OTHER SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED 19% FROM LAST YEAR TO THIS. THIS INCREASE  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED FREIGHT COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASED SHIPMENT OF PRODUCT TO CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS AN INCREASE  IN ACCRUED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION RESULTING FROM THE IMPROVED PROFITABILITY OF THE COMPANY.  THE  ABOVE FACTORS RESULTED IN OPERATING INCOME OF $430,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018, SIGNIFICANTLY MORE  THAN THE $35,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  STOCK OPTIONS  THE COMPANY HAS A STOCK OPTION PLAN WHICH PROVIDES  FOR THE GRANTING OF NONQUALIFIED OR INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS TO OFFICERS, KEY EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS. OPTIONS GRANTED  UNDER THE PLAN ARE EXERCISABLE OVER A TEN YEAR TERM. OPTIONS NOT EXERCISED AT THE END OF THE TERM EXPIRE.  THE  COMPANY EXPENSES STOCK OPTIONS USING THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF THE FASB ASC. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $57,000 AND  $56,000 OF COMPENSATION COST FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND  2017.  -  12  -  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH STOCK OPTION GRANT HAS  BEEN DETERMINED USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL. THE MODEL CONSIDERS ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO EXERCISE PRICE, EXPECTED VOLATILITY,  RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE, AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED TERM OF THE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTIONS USED  IN THE MODEL WERE BASED ON VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE FOR THE THIRTY MONTH PERIOD ENDING ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE  RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IS DERIVED FROM THE U.S. TREASURY YIELD. THE COMPANY USED A WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED TERM.

THESE ARE MAINLY INVENTORY, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS IN EXCESS OF BILLINGS,  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED COMMISSIONS, AND BILLINGS IN EXCESS OF COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS. THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY SOURCE OF  LIQUIDITY HAS BEEN OPERATIONS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018 WERE $326,000 COMPARED TO $737,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE COMPANY  HAS COMMITMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALING $15,000 DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. THESE COSTS ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO ACQUISITION  OF NEW EQUIPMENT USED TO TEST THE FUNCTION OF PRODUCTS PRIOR TO SHIPMENT TO CUSTOMERS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS CARRYING ADEQUATE  INSURANCE COVERAGE ON ITS FACILITIES AND THEIR CONTENTS.  EFFECTIVE AUGUST 30, 2017, THE COMPANY REPLACED  ITS BANK CREDIT FACILITY WITH A $10,000,000 BANK DEMAND LINE OF CREDIT, WITH INTEREST PAYABLE AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION OF 30, 60  OR 90 DAY LIBOR RATE PLUS 2.25%. THERE IS NO BALANCE OUTSTANDING AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018 OR AS OF MAY 31, 2018. THE LINE IS UNSECURED  AND INCLUDES A NEGATIVE PLEDGE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PROPERTY. THIS LINE OF CREDIT IS SUBJECT TO THE USUAL  TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLIED BY THE BANK, IS SUBJECT TO RENEWAL ANNUALLY, AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO AN EXPRESS REQUIREMENT ON THE BANK\u2019S  PART TO LEND.  -  13  -  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVENTORY AND MAINTENANCE INVENTORY  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  MAY 31, 2018  INCREASE /(DECREASE)  RAW MATERIALS  $710,000  $727,000  $(17,000  )  -2%  WORK-IN-PROCESS  10,807,000  9,990,000  817,000  8%  FINISHED GOODS  565,000  601,000  (36,000  )  -6%  INVENTORY  12,082,000  93%  11,318,000  93%  764,000  7%  MAINTENANCE AND OTHER INVENTORY  870,000  7%  886,000  7%  (16,000  )  -2%  TOTAL  $12,952,000  100%  $12,204,000  100%  $748,000  6%  INVENTORY TURNOVER  2.0  1.5  NOTE: INVENTORY TURNOVER IS ANNUALIZED FOR  THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.

APPROXIMATELY 89% OF THE CURRENT INVENTORY IS WORK  IN PROCESS, 5% IS FINISHED GOODS, AND 6% IS RAW MATERIALS.  MAINTENANCE AND OTHER INVENTORY REPRESENT STOCK  THAT IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE IN EXCESS OF TWELVE MONTHS. THIS STOCK REPRESENTS CERTAIN ITEMS THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED  TO MAINTAIN FOR SERVICE OF PRODUCTS SOLD AND ITEMS THAT ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO SPONTANEOUS ORDERING. THIS INVENTORY IS PARTICULARLY  SENSITIVE TO TECHNOLOGICAL OBSOLESCENCE IN THE NEAR TERM DUE TO ITS USE IN INDUSTRIES CHARACTERIZED BY THE CONTINUOUS INTRODUCTION  OF NEW PRODUCT LINES, RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE. MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED AN ALLOWANCE  FOR POTENTIAL INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE. THE PROVISION FOR POTENTIAL INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE WAS $85,000 AND $60,000 FOR THE SIX MONTH  PERIODS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND 2017. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO REWORK SLOW-MOVING INVENTORY, WHERE APPLICABLE, TO CONVERT IT  TO PRODUCT TO BE USED ON CUSTOMER ORDERS.

AS THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FIGURE RISES IN RELATION TO THE OTHER TWO FIGURES, THE COMPANY CAN ANTICIPATE  INCREASED CASH RECEIPTS WITHIN THE ENSUING 30-60 DAYS.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $4,994,000 AS OF NOVEMBER  30, 2018 INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY $1,029,000 OF AMOUNTS RETAINED BY CUSTOMERS ON PROJECTS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT AMOUNTS RETAINED BY  CUSTOMERS UNDER CONTRACTS WILL BE RELEASED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE BUSINESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELATED CONTRACTS. ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE ALSO INCLUDES $110,000 OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS (\u201cALLOWANCE\u201d). THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE  AS OF MAY 31, 2018 OF $6,266,000 INCLUDED AN ALLOWANCE OF $110,000.  -  14  -  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE  NUMBER OF AN AVERAGE DAY'S SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (\u201cDSO\u201d) DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 88 DAYS AT  MAY 31, 2018 TO 47 AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  THE DSO IS A FUNCTION OF 1.) THE LEVEL OF SALES FOR AN AVERAGE DAY (FOR EXAMPLE,  TOTAL SALES FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS DIVIDED BY 90 DAYS) AND 2.) THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE  LEVEL OF SALES FOR AN AVERAGE DAY IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR IS 48% MORE THAN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE  PRIOR YEAR. THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT THE END OF THE CURRENT FISCAL QUARTER IS 20% LESS THAN THE LEVEL AT THE END OF  THE PRIOR YEAR. THE SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE COMBINED WITH THE INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF AN AVERAGE  DAY\u2019S SALES CAUSED THE DSO TO DECREASE FROM LAST YEAR END TO THIS QUARTER-END. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE DECREASE IN THE  LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM LAST YEAR END TO THIS QUARTER-END WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER BILLINGS FOR PROJECTS IN NOVEMBER 2018  ($1.2 MILLION) COMPARED TO MAY 2018 ($2.6 MILLION). THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO COLLECT THE NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE, INCLUDING  THE RETAINAGE, DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  AS NOTED ABOVE, CIEB REPRESENTS REVENUES RECOGNIZED  IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS BILLED. WHENEVER POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY NEGOTIATES A PROVISION IN SALES CONTRACTS TO ALLOW THE COMPANY TO BILL,  AND COLLECT FROM THE CUSTOMER, PAYMENTS IN ADVANCE OF SHIPMENTS. UNFORTUNATELY, SUCH PROVISIONS ARE OFTEN NOT POSSIBLE. THE $5,953,000  BALANCE IN THIS ACCOUNT AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018 IS 6% LESS THAN THE PRIOR YEAR-END BALANCE. THIS DECREASE IS THE RESULT OF NORMAL  FLOW OF THE PROJECTS THROUGH PRODUCTION WITH BILLINGS TO THE CUSTOMERS AS PERMITTED IN THE RELATED CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS  TO BILL THE ENTIRE AMOUNT DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. 19% OF THE CIEB BALANCE AS OF THE END OF THE LAST FISCAL QUARTER, AUGUST  31, 2018, WAS BILLED TO THOSE CUSTOMERS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL QUARTER ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018. THE REMAINDER WILL BE BILLED AS  THE PROJECTS PROGRESS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS SPECIFIED IN THE VARIOUS CONTRACTS.  THE BALANCES IN THIS ACCOUNT ARE COMPRISED  OF THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS.

THE BALANCE IN THIS ACCOUNT FLUCTUATES IN THE  SAME MANNER AND FOR THE SAME REASONS AS THE ACCOUNT \u201cCOSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS IN EXCESS OF BILLINGS\u201d, DISCUSSED  ABOVE. FINAL DELIVERY OF PRODUCT UNDER THESE CONTRACTS IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  THE BALANCES IN THIS ACCOUNT ARE COMPRISED OF THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS.

OTHER BALANCE SHEET ITEMS  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AT $2,120,000 AS OF NOVEMBER  30, 2018, IS 45% MORE THAN THE PRIOR YEAR-END. THIS SIGNIFICANT INCREASE REFLECTS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MATERIAL PURCHASES  IN NOVEMBER 2018 OVER MAY 2018 IN ORDER TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCT FOR CUSTOMER ORDERS. COMMISSION EXPENSE ON APPLICABLE SALES ORDERS  IS RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. THE COMMISSION IS PAID FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF PAYMENT FROM THE CUSTOMERS. ACCRUED  COMMISSIONS AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018 ARE $970,000, DOWN 1% FROM THE $983,000 ACCRUED AT THE PRIOR YEAR-END. OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES  INCREASED 29% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR-END, TO $1,818,000.

OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  AMERICAS RECYCLING  ,  AMERICAS MILLS  ,  AMERICAS FABRICATION  , AND  INTERNATIONAL MILL.  FINANCIAL RESULTS OVERVIEW  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND EXCLUDES ANY RESULTS OF OUR DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

NET SALES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  INCREASED  19%  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD FOR FISCAL  2018  , WITH APPROXIMATELY $121.2 MILLION OF THE INCREASE ATTRIBUTABLE TO OPERATIONS OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  .  ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN NET SALES, OUR NEW MICRO MILL IN DURANT, OKLAHOMA SHIPPED APPROXIMATELY 59 THOUSAND SHORT TONS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WITH NO COMPARABLE ACTIVITY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. CONTINUED STRENGTH IN GLOBAL DEMAND FOR STEEL HAS LED TO INCREASED MARGINS ACROSS OUR AMERICAS RECYCLING, AMERICAS MILLS AND INTERNATIONAL MILL SEGMENTS AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. OUR AMERICAS FABRICATION SEGMENT CONTINUES TO REFLECT AVERAGE SELLING PRICES THAT HAVE LAGGED BEHIND INCREASED INPUT AND PRODUCTION COSTS.  HOWEVER, NEW CONTRACT BOOKINGS INDICATE THAT PRICING IN THIS SEGMENT IS BEGINNING TO REFLECT THE INCREASED INPUT COSTS.  EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  INCLUDES CERTAIN PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  , INCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF THE ACQUIRED UNFAVORABLE CONTRACT BACKLOG.  ADDITIONALLY, INCLUDED IN OUR RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WERE CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, INCLUDING INTEGRATION EFFORTS. THESE COSTS HAVE BEEN REFLECTED IN THE RESULTS OF OUR CORPORATE AND OTHER SEGMENT.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  INCREASED  $21.1 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  , DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEES AND LEGAL EXPENSES.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  INCREASED  $10.1 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  .  THE INCREASE WAS, IN PART, A RESULT OF FINANCING ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  , INCLUDING ISSUANCE OF THE  2026 NOTES  AND A DRAW UNDER THE  2018 TERM LOAN  (BOTH DEFINED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  ), DRIVING A YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE OF $5.6 MILLION.  ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018, WAS A REDUCTION OF $3.8 MILLION IN CAPITALIZED INTEREST.  CAPITALIZED INTEREST, WHICH REDUCES INTEREST EXPENSE, WAS HIGHER IN FISCAL 2018 DUE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF OUR NEW MICRO MILL IN DURANT, OKLAHOMA, WHICH WAS PLACED IN SERVICE DURING FISCAL 2018.  27  INCOME TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AND  2017  WAS  22.4%  AND  20.9%  , RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE CURRENT PERIOD IS GREATER THAN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RECOGNITION OF MORE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AS DISCLOSED IN  NOTE 12, INCOME TAX.  SEGMENT OPERATING DATA  UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, ALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS BELOW ARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND CALCULATED BEFORE INCOME TAXES. FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE BASIS IN WHICH WE INTERNALLY DISAGGREGATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING OPERATING DECISIONS.

APPROXIMATELY 82% OF THE  DECREASE  IN NET SALES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  WAS DUE TO DECREASES IN NONFERROUS AVERAGE SELLING PRICES, AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  . SUCH DECREASE WAS THE RESULT OF A GENERAL DECLINE IN PRICING ACROSS NON-FERROUS COMMODITIES, INCLUDING COPPER AND ALUMINUM DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018.  ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  WAS RELATIVELY FLAT ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS, AS MODEST INCREASES IN AVERAGE COMBINED METAL MARGIN OF FERROUS AND NONFERROUS SCRAP WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY REDUCED SHIPMENTS, AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  ADJUSTED EBITDA INCLUDED NON-CASH STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $0.3 MILLION AND $0.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  28  AMERICAS MILLS  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2018  2017  NET SALES  $601,853  $413,518  ADJUSTED EBITDA  113,873  55,166  AVERAGE PRICE (PER SHORT TON)  TOTAL SALES  $682  $550  COST OF FERROUS SCRAP UTILIZED  307  256  METAL MARGIN  375  294  SHORT TONS (IN THOUSANDS)  MELTED  909  655  ROLLED  844  602  SHIPPED  847  677  NET SALES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  INCREASED  $188.3 MILLION  , OR  46%  , COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS DUE, IN PART, TO INCREASED SHIPMENTS OF  170  THOUSAND SHORT TONS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018, WITH THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  SHIPPING 114 THOUSAND SHORT TONS, AND OUR NEW MICRO MILL IN DURANT, OKLAHOMA SHIPPING 59 THOUSAND SHORT TONS. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASED YEAR-OVER-YEAR NET SALES WAS AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE OF  $132  PER SHORT TON, AS SELLING PRICES HAVE RISEN IN RESPONSE TO INCREASING INPUT COSTS.  ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  INCREASED  $58.7 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  , WITH THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  CONTRIBUTING  $11.6 MILLION  .  THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS DRIVEN BY METAL MARGIN EXPANSION ON REBAR AND MERCHANT PRODUCTS OF 37% AND 23%, RESPECTIVELY, COUPLED WITH INCREMENTAL SHIPMENTS FROM OUR NEW MICRO MILL IN DURANT, OKLAHOMA.  PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES IN ADJUSTED EBITDA WERE INCREASES IN CONVERSION COSTS, INCLUDING ELECTRODE AND ALLOY COSTS, TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $16 PER SHORT TON DURING THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN FISCAL  2018  .

SHIPMENTS IN THIS SEGMENT  INCREASED  BY  55  THOUSAND SHORT TONS, APPROXIMATELY 52 THOUSAND SHORT TONS OF WHICH WERE SHIPPED BY THE REBAR FABRICATION LOCATIONS OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  .  AMORTIZATION BENEFIT OF  $11.3 MILLION  RELATED TO THE UNFAVORABLE CONTRACT BACKLOG OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  WAS INCLUDED AS AN INCREASE TO NET SALES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  29  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , THIS SEGMENT REPORTED AN ADJUSTED EBITDA LOSS OF  $37.0 MILLION  , COMPARED TO ADJUSTED EBITDA OF  $2.0 MILLION  IN THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  .  ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY  $11.3 MILLION  OF AMORTIZATION OF UNFAVORABLE CONTRACT BACKLOG DESCRIBED ABOVE. IN ADDITION TO THESE LOSSES, THE OTHER PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS A 38% REDUCTION IN AVERAGE REBAR FABRICATION METAL MARGIN FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , DRIVEN BY THE LAG IN OUR FABRICATION PROJECT BACKLOG WHERE AVERAGE SELLING PRICES DID NOT KEEP PACE WITH INCREASING RAW MATERIAL AND CONVERSION COSTS. ADJUSTED EBITDA INCLUDED NON-CASH STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $0.6 MILLION AND $0.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE WAS DRIVEN LARGELY BY INCREASED CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY AND CONTINUED ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS IN POLAND AND THE SURROUNDING MARKETS, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES OF  6%  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  .  SHORT TONS SHIPPED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  DECREASED  MODERATELY AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 AS A RESULT OF PLANNED DOWNTIME DURING THE FIRST QUARTER FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  ALSO REFLECTED UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACTS OF APPROXIMATELY $8.5 MILLION DUE TO THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN RELATION TO THE POLISH ZLOTY.  ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  INCREASED  6%  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  .  THE  INCREASE  IN ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  RESULTED FROM METAL MARGIN INCREASES ACROSS ALL PRODUCT LINES, RESULTING IN AN OVERALL  14%  INCREASE IN AVERAGE METAL MARGIN COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  .  ADJUSTED EBITDA INCLUDED NON-CASH STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $0.1 MILLION AND $0.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.

THE ADDITIONAL LOSS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018, WAS THE RESULT OF A $24.1 MILLION INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEES AND LEGAL EXPENSES.  ALSO INCLUDED IN CORPORATE AND OTHER ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS APPROXIMATELY  $9.7 MILLION  RELATED TO THE ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY PROFIT ON SHIPMENTS ACROSS SEGMENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WHILE WE BELIEVE THE LENDING INSTITUTIONS PARTICIPATING IN OUR CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS ARE FINANCIALLY CAPABLE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE BANKING AND CAPITAL MARKETS PERIODICALLY EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY THAT MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL IN A COST EFFICIENT MANNER. OUR FINANCING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RAISING CAPITAL MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES TO OUR CREDIT RATING MADE BY ANY RATING AGENCY.  30  SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR U.S. OPERATIONS HAVE ACCESS TO THE  $350.0 MILLION  CREDIT FACILITY DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  , AND AVAILABILITY UNDER THE  $200.0 MILLION  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAM DESCRIBED BELOW.  WE REGULARLY MAINTAIN A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND, BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMERS' FINANCIAL CONDITION, WE RECORD ALLOWANCES AS SOON AS WE BELIEVE ACCOUNTS ARE UNCOLLECTIBLE. CONTINUED PRESSURE ON THE LIQUIDITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES AS WE MAKE OUR ASSESSMENTS IN THE FUTURE. WE USE CREDIT INSURANCE INTERNATIONALLY TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF CUSTOMER INSOLVENCY. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT INSURED RECEIVABLES (AND THOSE COVERED BY EXPORT LETTERS OF CREDIT) WAS APPROXIMATELY  13%  OF TOTAL TRADE RECEIVABLES AT  NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  FOR ADDED FLEXIBILITY, AS NEEDED, WE MAY DRAW CASH ADVANCES UNDER THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES PROGRAMS IN THE U.S. AND POLAND. SEE  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  , FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  THE TABLE BELOW REFLECTS OUR SOURCES, FACILITIES AND AVAILABILITY OF LIQUIDITY AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  .

CASH FLOWS  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES RESULT PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF STEEL AND RELATED PRODUCTS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, SALES OF NONFERROUS METAL PRODUCTS AND OTHER RAW MATERIALS USED IN STEEL MANUFACTURING. WE HAVE A DIVERSE AND GENERALLY STABLE CUSTOMER BASE. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE USE FUTURES OR FORWARD CONTRACTS TO MITIGATE THE RISKS FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN METAL COMMODITY PRICES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, NATURAL GAS PRICES AND INTEREST RATES. SEE  NOTE 10, DERIVATIVES AND RISK MANAGEMENT  , FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  WITH THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15, CASH RECEIPTS RELATED TO THE COLLECTION OF THE DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE (\"DPP\") FROM OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS IN THE U.S. AND POLAND (THE \"PROGRAMS\"), PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WERE RECORDED AS CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , UPON ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15, COUPLED WITH AMENDMENTS MADE TO THE PROGRAMS, AS DISCUSSED IN  NOTE 6, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS  , CASH COLLECTIONS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 RELATED TO OUR OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF DPP OF  $367.5 MILLION  AT AUGUST 31, 2018 WERE REFLECTED AS CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  AS  RESULT OF THE AMENDMENTS TO THE PROGRAMS, EXCLUDING COLLECTIONS RELATED TO THE OUTSTANDING DPP BALANCE AT AUGUST 31, 2018, FUTURE CASH COLLECTIONS OF TRADE RECEIVABLES UNDER THE PROGRAMS ARE CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AND CASH ADVANCES, INCLUDING REPAYMENT OF SUCH ADVANCES, ARE CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING ACTIVITIES BEGINNING IN FISCAL  2019.  NET CASH FLOWS USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $357.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , COMPARED TO  $120.2 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017  .  THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15 DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHICH RESULTED IN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF  $367.5 MILLION  AND  $176.0 MILLION  RELATED TO CASH COLLECTIONS OF THE DPP FROM THE PROGRAMS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ASU 2016-15, THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS WAS DUE TO  DECREASED  CASH FLOWS FROM EARNINGS AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION NON-CASH CHARGES, AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  .  YEAR-OVER-YEAR CASH FLOWS FROM CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (\"WORKING CAPITAL\") FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  REFLECT A MODERATE INCREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL.  FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING  31  IMPROVED BY TWO DAYS, WHILE DAYS SALES IN INVENTORY DETERIORATED BY NINE DAYS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH FLOWS USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $379.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017  . THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR  INCREASE  IN CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  , AS DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 2, ACQUISITION  . PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS, THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15 RESULTED IN A TOTAL YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE OF  $281.6 MILLION  , INCLUDING  $191.6 MILLION  RELATED TO THE CASH COLLECTIONS OF THE DPP FROM THE PROGRAMS, AND A  $90.0 MILLION  REPAYMENT DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 OF CASH ADVANCES UNDER THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE OUTSTANDING AT AUGUST 31, 2017.  WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR FISCAL  2019  CAPITAL BUDGET WILL RANGE BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY  $175 MILLION TO $225 MILLION  . WE REGULARLY ASSESS OUR CAPITAL SPENDING AND REEVALUATE OUR REQUIREMENTS BASED ON CURRENT AND EXPECTED RESULTS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET YEAR-OVER-YEAR CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  BY  $164.7 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017  .  THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DRAW UNDER THE  2018 TERM LOAN  DURING FISCAL  2019  . THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  INCREASED  YEAR-OVER-YEAR PAYMENTS OF  $4.2 MILLION  RELATED TO REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT DURING FISCAL  2019  , INCLUDING REQUIRED MINIMUM PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERM LOANS (AS DEFINED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  ), AS WELL AS NET REPAYMENTS OF AMOUNTS DRAWN UNDER THE PROGRAMS. WE REGULARLY EVALUATE THE USE OF OUR CASH IN EFFORTS TO MAXIMIZE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, INCLUDING DEBT REPAYMENT, CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  WE ANTICIPATE OUR CURRENT CASH BALANCES, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND OUR AVAILABLE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING OUR SCHEDULED DEBT REPAYMENTS, PAYMENTS FOR OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, DIVIDENDS AND OTHER PRUDENT USES OF OUR CAPITAL, SUCH AS FUTURE ACQUISITIONS. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT OF SUSTAINED MARKET DETERIORATION, WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES AND TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL FUNDS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AT  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY  $400 MILLION  FROM  AUGUST 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  .  SUCH INCREASE INCLUDES FINANCING AND RELATED INTEREST OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  RELATED TO ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS PURCHASING ACTIVITIES. OUR ESTIMATED CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDING  NOVEMBER 30  ,  2019  ARE APPROXIMATELY  $580 MILLION  AND PRIMARILY CONSIST OF EXPENDITURES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH NORMAL REVENUE PRODUCING ACTIVITIES.  OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  WE MAINTAIN STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT OUR INSURANCE PROVIDERS AND SUPPLIERS REQUEST. AT  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , WE HAD COMMITTED  $28.3 MILLION  UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, OF WHICH  $3.3 MILLION  REDUCED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVER.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  , WE HAVE TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS IN BOTH THE U.S. AND POLAND.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, THE PROGRAMS WERE AMENDED SUCH THAT THEY NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR OFF-BALANCE SHEET TREATMENT. FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, WE ACCOUNTED FOR TRANSFERS OF THE TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS SALES: TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES TRANSFERRED WERE REMOVED FROM THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, AND CASH ADVANCES RECEIVED WERE REFLECTED AS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES ON OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  CONTINGENCIES  IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESS, WE BECOME INVOLVED IN LITIGATION, ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENTAL  INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. WE MAY INCUR SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS BECAUSE OF SOME OF THESE MATTERS. LIABILITIES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION-RELATED LOSS CONTINGENCIES REQUIRE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BASED ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING EACH MATTER AND THE ADVICE OF OUR LEGAL COUNSEL. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR LITIGATION-RELATED LOSSES WHEN A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND WE CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS. WE EVALUATE THE MEASUREMENT OF RECORDED LIABILITIES EACH REPORTING PERIOD BASED ON THE CURRENT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SPECIFIC TO EACH MATTER. THE ULTIMATE LOSSES INCURRED UPON FINAL RESOLUTION OF LITIGATION-RELATED LOSS CONTINGENCIES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY RECORDED AT A PARTICULAR BALANCE SHEET DATE. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES OCCUR. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TO WHICH WE ARE A PARTY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IF THE APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY ARISES, THE COMPANY WILL EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL DIVESTITURE OF A PRODUCT LINE OR BUSINESS.

SALES IN THIS SEGMENT INCREASED DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF ITS EVO PRODUCT LINE, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN SATELLITE RADIO SALES.  YEAR OVER YEAR SALES WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY HIGHER SALES IN ITS SUBARU REMOTE START PROGRAM AND PRIVATE LABEL PRODUCTS, OFFSET BY DECLINES IN OUR AFTERMARKET HEADREST PRODUCTS.  THE DECLINES IN BOTH SATELLITE RADIO SALES AND AFTERMARKET HEADRESTS ARE THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN STANDARD FACTORY EQUIPPED VEHICLES WITH THESE OPTIONS.  SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  WERE ALSO IMPACTED BY A PRODUCT LOAD-IN FOR AN AFTERMARKET LINE IN THE PRIOR YEAR'S QUARTER WHICH DID NOT REPEAT IN FISCAL 2019.  PREMIUM AUDIO SALES REPRESENTED  38.3%  AND  35.9%  OF OUR NET SALES FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO  36.7%  AND  35.1%  IN THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. SALES DECREASED IN THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO LOWER SALES OF CERTAIN DISCONTINUED PRODUCTS INCLUDING POWERED TOWERS, DIGITAL SPEAKERS, DIGITAL SYSTEMS AND FLOOR SPEAKERS, ELIMINATION OF OVERSTOCK IN CERTAIN INVENTORY LEVELS, AS WELL AS A SHIFT IN DEMAND FROM TRADITIONAL WIRED MOBILITY PRODUCTS TO BLUETOOTH/WIRELESS SOLUTIONS.  NEW PRODUCTS FOR BLUETOOTH/WIRELESS SOLUTIONS HAVE NOT YET LAUNCHED.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN SALES IN ITS EUROPEAN MARKET AS A RESULT OF THE TIMING OF CERTAIN CUSTOMER ORDERS, AND A SHIFT IN SALES STRATEGY RELATED TO OUR E-COMMERCE CHANNEL THAT HAS TEMPORARILY DELAYED SALES.  PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE YEAR TO DATE SALES DECLINE IS THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF TWO NEW DOMESTIC PRODUCT LINES DURING FISCAL 2019.  CONSUMER ACCESSORY SALES REPRESENTED  26.7%  AND  27.2%  OF OUR NET SALES FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO  37.3%  AND  36.1%  IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THIS SEGMENT EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN SALES DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  DUE TO THE TIMING OF CUSTOMER ORDERS FOR WIRELESS AND BLUETOOTH SPEAKERS, INCLUDING LARGE LOAD-IN ORDERS OF NEW WIRELESS SPEAKER PRODUCT DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  THAT DID NOT REPEAT IN THE CURRENT YEAR, AND A STREAMLINING OF PRODUCTS AND REDUCED STORE COUNTS FOR CERTAIN RETAILERS.  ADDITIONALLY, DURING FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY LAUNCHED ITS STRIIV ACTIVITY TRACKING BANDS.  SIGNIFICANT LOAD-IN ORDERS FOR THIS PRODUCT DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  DID NOT REPEAT IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  SALES WERE ALSO IMPACTED DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  BY LOWER SALES IN THE HOME AUDIO AND RECEPTION CATEGORIES DUE TO RETAIL DISTRIBUTION CHANGES AND HIGHER LOAD IN SALES IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS.  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN SALES WITHIN ITS EUROPEAN MARKET PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN SALES STRATEGY RELATED TO OUR E-COMMERCE CHANNEL THAT HAS TEMPORARILY DELAYED SALES, AS WELL AS SALES OF EQUIPMENT AND SET TOP BOXES RELATED TO A DIGITAL BROADCASTING UPGRADE  IN THE PRIOR YEAR THAT DID NOT REPEAT IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  OFFSETTING THESE DECREASES WERE HIGHER SALES OF KARAOKE PRODUCTS, SPECIFICALLY THE NEW SINGSATION LINE, AS WELL AS INCREASES IN SALES FROM ADDITIONAL PLACEMENTS AND HIGHER DIRECT IMPORT SALES OF OUR PROJECT NURSERY PRODUCTS, THE INTRODUCTION OF OUR NEW SMART HOME LINE, AND HIGHER SALES OF SECURITY PRODUCTS DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  .  DUE TO THE ONGOING SALES DECLINES IN THIS SEGMENT AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS AND CHANGES IN RETAIL DISTRIBUTION, IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , THE COMPANY BEGAN AN AGGRESSIVE SKU RATIONALIZATION PROGRAM TO LIMIT SALES OF LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS AND RESTRUCTURED ITS CONSUMER ACCESSORIES SEGMENT.

GROSS PROFITS INCREASED IN THIS SEGMENT DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS AS A RESULT OF OUR NEW EVO PRODUCT SALES. GROSS MARGINS INCREASED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN PRODUCTION RELATED COST-CUTTING MEASURES, LOWER TOOLING COSTS, AND LOWER INVENTORY RESERVE REQUIREMENTS.  A DECLINE IN SALES OF AFTERMARKET PRODUCTS FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON MARGINS FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT.  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES IN THE PREMIUM AUDIO SEGMENT INCREASED  330  AND  460  BASIS POINTS FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. GROSS MARGINS IN THE PREMIUM AUDIO SEGMENT WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY A SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX INCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION OF OUR NEW REFERENCE AND REFERENCE PREMIER LINES, AND A DECLINE IN SALES OF LOWER MARGINED MOBILITY AND SOUND SYSTEM PRODUCTS IN THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS.  DURING THESE PERIODS, OUR MARGINS WERE ALSO FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY A DECLINE IN SALES FROM OUR EUROPEAN MARKET WHICH HAS HAD A HIGHER CONCENTRATION OF LOWER MARGINED PRODUCT.  MARGINS FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  WERE ALSO POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY THE ABSENCE OF SALES OF DISCONTINUED POWERED FLOORSTANDING SPEAKERS INCLUDED IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES IN THE CONSUMER ACCESSORIES SEGMENT INCREASED  360  AND  250  BASIS POINTS FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , GROSS MARGINS WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY A STRONGER MIX OF HIGHER MARGINED PRODUCT INCLUDING THE RECENT INTRODUCTION OF OUR NEW KARAOKE LINE, IMPROVED MARGINS AND PROFITS FOR OUR PROJECT NURSERY LINE, AND DECLINES IN SALES OF LOWER MARGIN PROJECT LINES WHILE MAINTAINING SALES LEVELS IN CERTAIN HIGHER MARGINED PRODUCT CATEGORIES. DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , MARGINS WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY A DECREASE IN SALES OF THE COMPANY'S STRIIV ACTIVITY TRACKING BAND WHICH HAD GENERATED LOWER MARGINS FOR THIS SEGMENT.  IN OUR EUROPEAN MARKET, CURRENT YEAR TO DATE MARGINS WERE IMPACTED BY THE ABSENCE OF LOWER MARGINED DIGITAL RECEPTION PRODUCT SALES AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AS WELL AS THE CURRENT YEAR INCREASE IN SALES IN OUR ONLINE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL.

SELLING EXPENSES ARE DOWN FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO VARIOUS COST-CUTTING MEASURES INCLUDING HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS, LOWER ADVERTISING COSTS, ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR TRADE SHOW PARTICIPATION, AND LOWER TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES.  OFFSETTING THESE DECLINES WAS AN INCREASE IN ONLINE PLATFORM FEES, INCLUDING A TERMINATION CHARGE FOR A DISCONTINUED PLATFORM AFFECTING THE YEAR TO DATE PERIOD.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PROFESSIONAL FEES, BONUS ACCRUALS AND INCENTIVES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PROFESSIONAL FEES RELATED TO TAX REFORM.  PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE DOWN DURING THE QUARTER DUE TO THE REIMBURSEMENT OF LEGAL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH A COUNTERFEIT LAWSUIT.  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECLINED DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF BONUS ACCRUALS RELATED TO THE SALE OF HIRSCHMANN, REIMBURSEMENT OF LEGAL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH A COUNTERFEIT LAWSUIT, AND LEGAL FEES FOR A PATENT LAWSUIT RECORDED IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  IN ADDITION, EXPENSES ARE DOWN IN THE CURRENT NINE-MONTH PERIOD DUE TO COST CUTTING EFFORTS RELATED TO HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS, TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT, AND VARIOUS OTHER GENERAL OFFICE EXPENSES.  ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  WERE IN LINE WITH THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , EXPENSES WERE DOWN DUE TO DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR OUR NEW EVO PRODUCT AND CERTAIN SEVERANCE COSTS BOTH RECORDED IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AND A DECLINE IN TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  THESE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN HEALTHCARE COSTS AND A RESTRUCTURING CHARGE FOR OUR GERMAN OPERATION.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY RE-EVALUATED ITS PROJECTIONS FOR SEVERAL BRANDS IN ITS CONSUMER ACCESSORY AND AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENTS BASED ON LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED RESULTS DUE TO LOWER PRODUCT LOAD-INS, INCREASED COMPETITION FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT LINES, A STREAMLINING OF SKU\u2019S, AND ITS MARKETING STRATEGY FOR ONE OF ITS BRANDS.  AS A RESULT OF THIS EVALUATION, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT SEVERAL OF ITS TRADEMARKS WERE IMPAIRED RESULTING IN A TOTAL CHARGE OF  $9,814  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018.

THE DECREASE IN THESE EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY DID NOT CARRY AN OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON ITS CREDIT FACILITY IN THESE PERIODS AFTER REPAYING THE ENTIRE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE CREDIT FACILITY FOLLOWING THE SALE OF HIRSCHMANN ON AUGUST 31, 2017.  EQUITY IN INCOME OF EQUITY INVESTEE REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF INCOME FROM ITS 50% NON-CONTROLLING OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN ASA ELECTRONICS LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES (\"ASA\"). THIS INCOME DECREASED FOR BOTH THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF HIGHER TOOLING COSTS FOR CERTAIN R&D PROJECTS, HIGHER LEGAL EXPENSES, AND A CHANGE IN PRODUCT AMORTIZATION EXPENSES, AS WELL AS DUE TO THE LIQUIDATION AND SELL THROUGH OF CERTAIN SLOW MOVING INVENTORY STOCK.  DURING JULY 2017, ONE OF THE COMPANY'S COST METHOD INVESTEES, RXNETWORKS, WAS SOLD TO A THIRD PARTY, RESULTING IN AN INVESTMENT GAIN RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  , REPRESENTING THE EXCESS OF THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED FOR THE INVESTMENT HELD BY THE COMPANY ON THE DATE OF THE TRANSACTION.  THE COMPANY HAS CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS IN VENEZUELA, WHICH ARE HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY MADE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE PROPERTIES AS A RESULT OF THE COUNTRY'S CONTINUED ECONOMIC DETERIORATION, WHICH INCLUDED A SIGNIFICANT CURRENCY DEVALUATION IN AUGUST OF 2018. THE COMPANY RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE AS A RESULT OF THIS ASSESSMENT REPRESENTING THE REMAINING BALANCE OF THESE PROPERTIES.  OTHER, NET PRIMARILY INCLUDES NET FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS OR LOSSES, INTEREST INCOME AND RENTAL INCOME.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , OTHER, NET DECLINED DUE TO A DECLINE IN INCOME FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING OF PRODUCT PURCHASES.  THIS DECLINE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME ON NEW INVESTMENTS WHICH IMPACTED BOTH THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  .  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  , THE COMPANY RECORDED A FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSS OF  $(6,618)  ON FORWARD CONTRACTS USED TO HEDGE THE SALE OF OUR HIRSCHMANN OPERATIONS (SEE NOTE 2).  INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  ON AUGUST 31, 2017, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS SALE OF HIRSCHMANN TO A SUBSIDIARY OF TE. THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY WAS \u20ac  148,500  . THE PURCHASE PRICE, AT THE EXCHANGE RATE AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON AUGUST 31, 2017, APPROXIMATED  $177,000  AND IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT BASED UPON THE FINAL WORKING CAPITAL. FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  , INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF A GAIN ON SALE OF  $36,118  , AS WELL AS OPERATING (LOSS) INCOME OF  $(12)  AND  $2,828  , RESPECTIVELY. OPERATING INCOME FOR THE COMPANY'S DISCONTINUED OPERATION FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  WAS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF TUNER AND ANTENNA SALES. FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , THERE WAS  NO  INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, AS ALL SALES AND OPERATIONS RELATING TO THE DISCONTINUED OPERATION CEASED FOLLOWING THE SALE OF HIRSCHMANN ON AUGUST 31, 2017.  INCOME TAX PROVISION  43  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  WAS AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF  62.8%  ON PRE-TAX INCOME OF  $6,491  , AND AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF  27.8%  ON A PRE-TAX LOSS OF  $(11,338)  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF  8.2%  ON PRE-TAX INCOME OF  $6,909  , AND AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF  23.1%  ON A PRE-TAX LOSS OF  $(19,586)  , IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  DIFFERS FROM THE STATUTORY RATE OF  21%  PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST RELATED TO EYELOCK LLC, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES, NONDEDUCTIBLE PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, AND INCOME TAXED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AT VARYING TAX RATES. IN ADDITION, THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE INCREASED FOR U.S. TAX CREDITS AND LOSSES IN CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH A LIMITED TAX BENEFIT CAN BE RECOGNIZED.  THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 IS A NEGATIVE 40.5%. THE CALCULATION OF THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS BASED ON OUR ANNUAL PRETAX INCOME FORECAST WHICH INCLUDES PROFITABLE JURISDICTIONS ANTICIPATING AN INCOME TAX PROVISION AND LOSS JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH A LIMITED TAX BENEFIT CAN BE RECOGNIZED. THE MIX OF THE JURISDICTIONS PRODUCES A NEGATIVE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WHICH RESULTS IN AN INCOME TAX PROVISION WHEN APPLIED TO THE PRETAX LOSS FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  . IF THE ANNUAL PRETAX INCOME FORECAST IS ACHIEVED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FISCAL YEAR, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES RECOGNIZING AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  DIFFERED FROM THE STATUTORY RATE OF  35%  PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT FOR DOMESTIC LOSSES, AS THE U.S. TAXABLE INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IS TREATED AS A SOURCE OF INCOME UNDER THE INTRA-PERIOD ALLOCATION GUIDANCE, COUPLED WITH THE MIX OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN EARNINGS, THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST RELATED TO EYELOCK LLC, AND AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO VARIOUS FEDERAL TAX CREDITS.  EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE  EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE ARE NOT FINANCIAL MEASURES RECOGNIZED BY GAAP. EBITDA REPRESENTS NET (LOSS) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO VOXX INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE AND BANK CHARGES, TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. ADJUSTED EBITDA REPRESENTS EBITDA ADJUSTED FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, GAINS ON THE SALE OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, LOSSES ON CERTAIN FORWARD CONTRACTS, AND INVESTMENT GAINS. DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE NON-CASH ITEMS. DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BASED ON ADJUSTED EBITDA.  WE PRESENT EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE IN THIS FORM 10-Q BECAUSE WE CONSIDER THEM TO BE USEFUL AND APPROPRIATE SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF OUR PERFORMANCE. ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE HELP US TO EVALUATE OUR PERFORMANCE WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN GAAP CALCULATIONS THAT MAY NOT HAVE A DIRECT CASH IMPACT ON OUR CURRENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN COSTS OR GAINS RELATING TO NON-RECURRING EVENTS ALLOWS FOR A MORE MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF OUR RESULTS FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD. THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, AS WE DEFINE THEM, ARE NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY ENTITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES AND MAY NOT BE AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE FOR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO OTHER COMPANIES. EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE SHOULD NOT BE ASSESSED IN ISOLATION FROM, ARE NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE MORE MEANINGFUL MEASURES THAN, OR ALTERNATIVES TO, MEASURES OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , WE HAD CASH AMOUNTS TOTALING  $38  HELD IN FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNTS,  NONE  OF WHICH WOULD BE SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAXES IF MADE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE UNITED STATES. THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT PROVIDES A 100% PARTICIPATION EXEMPTION ON DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM FOREIGN CORPORATIONS AFTER JANUARY 1, 2018 AS THE UNITED STATES HAS MOVED AWAY FROM A WORLDWIDE TAX SYSTEM AND CLOSER TO A TERRITORIAL SYSTEM FOR EARNINGS OF FOREIGN CORPORATIONS.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED CASH OF  $10,105  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED COLLECTIONS ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WHICH WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY EXPECTED HOLIDAY SEASON SALES ACTIVITY, INCREASES IN SALES INCENTIVES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, WHICH WERE OFFSET BY INCREASE IN INVENTORY AND A DECREASE IN ACCRUED EXPENSES.

DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  , FINANCING ACTIVITIES USED CASH OF  $91,663  PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REPAYMENT OF BALANCES OUTSTANDING ON THE COMPANY'S CREDIT FACILITY AS A RESULT OF THE SALE OF HIRSCHMANN.  THE COMPANY HAS A SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY (THE \"CREDIT FACILITY\") THAT PROVIDES FOR A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH COMMITTED AVAILABILITY OF UP TO  $140,000  , WHICH MAY BE INCREASED, AT THE OPTION OF THE COMPANY, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF  $175,000  , AND A TERM LOAN IN THE AMOUNT OF  $15,000  .

LOANS DESIGNATED AS BASE RATE LOANS SHALL BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE EQUAL TO THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR BASE RATE LOANS OF  0.75  -  1.25%  AS DEFINED IN THE AGREEMENT.

TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE AND PROFITABLE GROWTH, OUR COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTROL THE TIMING AND COSTS OF OUR PROJECTS WHEREVER POSSIBLE. WE HAVE FILED FOR PATENT PROTECTION OF OUR DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY FOR ADDITIONAL COMPOUNDS SUCH AS PHOSPHODIESTERASE INHIBITORS, HUMAN HORMONES SUCH AS ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTERONE, AND MORE.  DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, AND UP TO THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, WE EXPERIENCED THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS.  ON SEPTEMBER 7, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ADDITIONS TO ITS PATENT PORTFOLIO. THREE NEW AUSTRALIAN PATENTS WERE GRANTED TO LEXARIA BY THE AUSTRALIAN PATENT OFFICE, BRINGING THE COMPANY\u2019S WORLDWIDE PATENT PORTFOLIO TO EIGHT ISSUED PATENTS: FOUR EACH IN THE US AND AUSTRALIA. ALL EIGHT PATENTS ARE WITHIN LEXARIA\u2019S FIRST PATENT FAMILY, \u201cFOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS INFUSED WITH LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\u201d, AND SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHEN LEXARIA\u2019S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS IN THE US AND AUSTRALIA. THE THREE NEW AUSTRALIAN PATENTS ARE PROJECTED TO EXPIRE ON JUNE 10, 2035.  THE US PATENT & TRADEMARK OFFICE ALSO ISSUED TWO NEW NOTICES OF ALLOWANCE FOR PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE CORRESPONDING US ISSUED PATENTS PRIOR TO YEAR-END 2018. THE COMPANY IS CONCURRENTLY PURSUING ACCELERATED EXAMINATION IN AUSTRALIA BASED ON THESE US NOTICES OF ALLOWANCE AND EXPECTS TWO NEW AUSTRALIAN PATENTS TO ALSO BE ISSUED PRIOR TO YEAR-END 2018. IF ISSUED IN BOTH THE US AND AUSTRALIA, THE COMPANY WILL THEN HOLD TWELVE ISSUED PATENTS WITHIN ITS FIRST PATENT FAMILY AND CONTINUES TO PURSUE CLAIMS IN CORRESPONDING PENDING APPLICATIONS WITHIN THIS FIRST PATENT FAMILY AROUND THE WORLD. LEXARIA HAS NOW FILED A TOTAL OF OVER 50 PATENT APPLICATIONS ACROSS NINE CURRENT PATENT FAMILIES.  19  ON SEPTEMBER 7, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE FILING OF A NEW STRATEGIC PATENT APPLICATION. THE NEW PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION IS ENTITLED \u201cLIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENT INFUSED TOBACCO LEAVES AND/OR TOBACCO MATERIALS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\u201d. THIS APPLICATION REPRESENTS LEXARIA\u2019S TENTH PATENT FAMILY AND EXPANDS THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ALREADY-PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGICAL PROCESS TO IMPART BENEFITS TO TOBACCO LEAVES THAT MAY BE UTILIZED TO DELIVER COMPOUNDS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT INCLUDE NICOTINE.  LEXARIA ALSO ANNOUNCED IT CANCELLED THE CONTRACT ANNOUNCED ON APRIL 25, 2018 WITH GP HOLDINGS LLC DUE TO ONGOING DELAYS AND NON-PERFORMANCE.  ON OCTOBER 10, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT HAS COMPLETED THE CREATION OF FOUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES. THIS NEW CORPORATE STRUCTURE MORE SUITABLY REFLECTS THE DISTINCT CUSTOMER BASES AND BUSINESS APPLICATIONS FOR EACH SUBSIDIARY, THEREBY ALLOWING THE COMPANY TO FOCUS ITS FUTURE RESEARCH AND CONSIDER FINANCING STRUCTURES AND INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS SPECIFICALLY OPTIMIZED TO EACH.  \u00b7  LEXARIA CANPHARM CORP., A CANADIAN COMPANY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER ENHANCEMENTS TO THE GLOBAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY.  \u00b7  LEXARIA NICOTINE CORP., A US COMPANY WITH A GLOBAL LICENSE TO PROVIDE DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY TO THE GLOBAL NICOTINE AND TOBACCO INDUSTRIES.  \u00b7  LEXARIA HEMP CORP., A US COMPANY GLOBALLY LICENSED TO PROVIDE DEHYDRATECH TO THE RAPIDLY GROWING HEMP-BASED FOODS AND SUPPLEMENTS INDUSTRIES.  \u00b7  LEXARIA PHARMACEUTICAL CORP., A US COMPANY GLOBALLY EMPOWERED TO LICENSE DEHYDRATECH TO THE LARGE AND DIVERSE PHARMACEUTICAL SECTORS.  ON OCTOBER 16, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT WAS GRANTED TWO NEW US PATENTS. LEXARIA NOW HAS SIX GRANTED PATENTS IN THE US AND FOUR GRANTED PATENTS IN AUSTRALIA. ALL TEN OF THESE PATENTS ARE WITHIN LEXARIA\u2019S FIRST PATENT FAMILY, \u201cFOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS INFUSED WITH LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\u201d. SPECIFICALLY, THE TWO NEW PATENTS ARE RELATED TO CERTAIN CANNABINOID INFUSED BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS UTILIZING LEXARIA\u2019S PROPRIETARY DEHYDRATECH PROCESS. NEWLY GRANTED PATENT NUMBERS US 10,103,225 B2 AND US 10,084,044 B2 PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR COMPOSITIONS AS WELL AS METHODS FOR MAKING THE COMPOSITIONS, EACH OF WHICH INCLUDE THE USE OF BOTH NON-PSYCHOACTIVE CANNABINOIDS SUCH AS CBD AND ALSO PSYCHOACTIVE CANNABINOIDS SUCH AS THC.  ON OCTOBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY CLOSED A NON-BROKERED PRIVATE PLACEMENT FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF $1,515,440 (THE \u201cOFFERING\u201d). THE OFFERING CONSISTED OF 947,150 UNITS (EACH, A \u201cUNIT\u201d) AT AN ISSUE PRICE OF $1.60 PER UNIT. EACH UNIT CONSISTS OF ONE COMMON SHARE OF THE COMPANY (A \u201cSHARE\u201d) AND ONE COMMON SHARE PURCHASE WARRANT (EACH, A \u201cWARRANT\u201d). EACH WARRANT ENTITLES THE HOLDER TO ACQUIRE ONE COMMON SHARE OF THE COMPANY AT A PRICE OF $2.25 PER COMMON SHARE FOR A PERIOD OF 24 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE OFFERING. FINDER\u2019S FEES OF $45,080 AND 28,175 FINDER\u2019S WARRANTS WERE PAID ON A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS RAISED, WITH EACH FINDER\u2019S WARRANT HAVING EXERCISE TERMS IDENTICAL TO THE WARRANTS ISSUED. THE WARRANTS WERE VALUED AT $16,095, WHICH WERE RECORDED AS A SHARE ISSUE COST WITHIN ADDITIONAL PAID IN CAPITAL FOR A NET EFFECT OF $NIL.  ON NOVEMBER 13, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE LAUNCH OF CHRGD+, A WATER-SOLUBLE, READY-MIX HEMP SUPPLEMENT POWDER PACKET FORMULATION DESIGNED TO BE ADDED TO ANY DRINK. LEXARIA ENGAGED CULTIVATING WELLNESS INC., A CALIFORNIA-BASED BRAND DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANY, TO CREATE THE CHRGD+ PREMIUM BRAND. CULTIVATING WELLNESS\u2019 DISTRIBUTION NETWORK REACHES TENS OF THOUSANDS OF RETAIL BUYERS IN C-STORES, GROCERY CHAINS, SPECIALTY RETAIL, AND NATIONAL ACCOUNTS.  ON NOVEMBER 26, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT SUBMITTED A RESEARCH APPLICATION UNDER HEALTH CANADA\u2019S CANNABIS TRACKING AND LICENSING SYSTEM FOR THE OPERATION OF A KELOWNA-BASED R&D LABORATORY WITHIN LEXARIA\u2019S NEW HEAD OFFICE. THE LABORATORY WILL ENHANCE LEXARIA\u2019S ABILITY TO FORMULATE FOR ANALYTICAL PURPOSES, VARIOUS PRODUCTS THAT MAY CONTAIN CANNABINOIDS OR OTHER CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. LEXARIA EXPECTS TO WORK ON CANNABINOID RELATED FORMULATIONS AS SOON AS THE LAB RECEIVES ITS RESEARCH LICENSE TO DO SO. EXPERIMENTAL WORK ON NICOTINE FORMULATIONS, NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS, VITAMINS AND OTHER BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS OF INTEREST WILL ALSO BEGIN SOON AFTER COMPLETION OF LAB CONSTRUCTION. BRINGING THIS WORK IN-HOUSE IS EXPECTED TO ENABLE THE COMPANY TO EXPAND ITS WORK SCHEDULES WHILE REDUCING COSTS AND DEVELOPMENT TIMELINES. LEXARIA ALSO APPOINTED DR. ED ERGENZINGER TO ITS EXECUTIVE TEAM AS CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER AND SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF INNOVATION FOR THE COMPANY. DR. ERGENZINGER IS A U.S. LICENSED PATENT ATTORNEY WHO ALSO HOLDS A DOCTORATE IN NEUROSCIENCE (WITH CONCENTRATIONS IN PHARMACOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY) AND IS AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR OF LAW.  20  FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE SHARE ISSUANCES AND RELATED VALUES.  TYPE OF ISSUANCE  NUMBER OF  SHARES  TOTAL  VALUE  WARRANT EXERCISE  309,800  $145,880  OPTION EXERCISE  330,000  $33,000  PRIVATE PLACEMENT  947,150  $1,515,440  1,586,950  $1,694,320  FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY  LEXARIA IS A BIOTECHNOLOGY AND FOOD SCIENCE COMPANY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING AND OUT-LICENSING ITS PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY FOR IMPROVED TASTE, RAPIDITY, AND DELIVERY OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN FOODS AND OTHER INGESTIBLE PRODUCTS LEXARIA IS FOCUSING ITS CAPITAL AND MANAGEMENT TIME ON ITS PURSUIT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, TECHNOLOGY LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES, AN EXPANDING PORTFOLIO OF PATENT PENDING APPLICATIONS, AND FUNCTIONAL FOOD AND SUPPLEMENT FORMULATIONS.  ON NOVEMBER 11, 2014, OUR COMPANY ACQUIRED 51% OF POVIVA TEA LLC AND EXECUTED AN OPERATING AGREEMENT TO DEVELOP A BUSINESS OF LEGALLY PRODUCING, MANUFACTURING, IMPORTING/EXPORTING, TESTING, RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING, A LINE OF HEMP OIL WITH CANNABIDIOL-INFUSED TEAS, DRINKS AND FOODS. LEXARIA OVERSEES ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRODUCTION, PRODUCT QUALITY, LICENSING, TESTING, PRODUCT LEGALITY, ACCOUNTING, MARKETING, CAPITAL INVESTMENT, CAPITAL RAISING, SALES, BRANDING, ADVERTISING AND FULFILLMENT. PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT, THERE IS A MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, WHEREBY THERE ARE TWO REPRESENTATIVES FROM LEXARIA AND ONE OF THE FOUNDING MEMBERS OF POVIVA. ON NOVEMBER 2, 2017, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE ACQUIRED 100% OF POVIVA TEA LLC.  THE COMPANY INTRODUCED AN EXPANDING VARIETY OF HEMP FORTIFIED CONSUMER FOOD PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT 2015 TO DEMONSTRATE LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY TO BOTH CONSUMERS AND POTENTIAL LICENSEES. FROM JANUARY 2015 TO DECEMBER 2015, SEVEN (7) FLAVORS OF TEAS; HOT CHOCOLATE; COFFEE, AND TWO (2) FLAVORS OF PROTEIN ENERGY BARS WERE INTRODUCED \u2013 ALL UTILIZING LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED TECHNOLOGY DEHYDRATECH  TM  FOR THE MORE PALATABLE AND EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF BIOACTIVE MOLECULES INFUSED WITHIN THOSE FOOD PRODUCTS.  IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE PRODUCTS, FOR EACH RAW MATERIAL TO BE USED IN VIPOVATM -BRANDED PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY ASSESSES IF THE PRODUCT INPUTS AND THE COMPLETED PRODUCTS COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE FOOD AND DRUG LAWS, AND THAT THE INPUTS AND THE FINISHED PRODUCTS MEET ALL APPLICABLE LEGAL AND QUALITY STANDARDS INCLUDING AND AS IT RELATES TO HEMP OIL CONTENT; THC CONTENT; MOLDS AND MILDEWS; HEAVY METALS; AND MAY MEASURE ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS.  THE US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, OWNS US PATENT #6630507, WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS, CLAIMS THAT  \u201c  CANNABINOIDS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO HAVE ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES, UNRELATED TO NMDA RECEPTOR ANTAGONISM. THIS NEW FOUND PROPERTY MAKES CANNABINOIDS USEFUL IN THE TREATMENT AND PROPHYLAXIS OF WIDE VARIETY OF OXIDATION ASSOCIATED DISEASES, SUCH AS ISCHEMIC, AGE-RELATED, INFLAMMATORY AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. THE CANNABINOIDS ARE FOUND TO HAVE PARTICULAR APPLICATION AS NEUROPROTECTANTS, FOR EXAMPLE IN LIMITING NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE FOLLOWING ISCHEMIC INSULTS, SUCH AS STROKE AND TRAUMA, OR IN THE TREATMENT OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES, SUCH AS ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE, PARKINSON\u2019S DISEASE AND HIV DEMENTIA.\u201d  21  FOR REFERENCE, CANNABINOIDS ARE COMPOUNDS THAT AFFECT CANNABINOID RECEPTORS LOCATED ON MANY HUMAN CELLS. CB1 RECEPTORS ARE WIDELY FOUND WITHIN THE HUMAN BRAIN; AND CB2 RECEPTORS ARE FOUND WITH THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM AND HAVE BEEN LINKED TO ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND OTHER RESPONSES.  DESPITE INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS IN MANY LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, SOME REGULATORY AGENCIES DO NOT OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZE THAT A HUMAN ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM EXISTS.  OVER ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT CANNABINOIDS HAVE BEEN ISOLATED FROM THE CANNABIS PLANT, MOST OF WHICH DO NOT HAVE PSYCHOACTIVE PROPERTIES. ONE THAT DOES HAVE PSYCHOACTIVE PROPERTIES IS TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL (THC). ENDOCANNABINOIDS ARE PRODUCED NATURALLY IN THE HUMAN BODY WHILE PHYTOCANNABINOIDS ARE PRODUCED IN SEVERAL PLANT SPECIES, MOST ABUNDANTLY IN THE CANNABIS PLANT.  CANNABIDIOL (\u201cCBD\u201d) IS ONE OF THE MAJOR PHYTOCANNABINOID FORMS OF CANNABINOIDS AND IS NOT PSYCHOACTIVE, OFTEN CONTRIBUTING MORE THAN 35% OF THE EXTRACTS FROM THE CANNABIS PLANT RESIN. CANNABIDIOL OCCURS NATURALLY IN OTHER PLANT SPECIES BEYOND CANNABIS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MOST WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF PHYTOCANNABINOID IS IN THE BETTER UNDERSTOOD ECHINACEA SPECIES, IN WIDESPREAD USE AS A DIETARY SUPPLEMENT. MOST PHYTOCANNABINOIDS ARE VIRTUALLY INSOLUBLE IN WATER BUT ARE SOLUBLE IN LIPIDS AND ALCOHOL. THE WORLD ANTI DOPING AGENCY (\u201cWADA\u201d) HAS EXEMPTED CBD FROM ITS 2018 LIST OF BANNED SUBSTANCES.  THE ALTERNATIVE HEALTH SECTOR IS LARGE AND GROWING. A LONG TERM MEDICAL EXPENDITURE PANEL SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED FROM 2002 UNTIL 2008 WITH AT LEAST 29,370 SUBJECTS ASKED REPEATEDLY IF THEY HAD SEEN ANY KIND OF HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER IN THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS. THE SURVEY RECORDED WHETHER THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WAS A \u201cCOMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE CARE PROFESSIONAL,\u201d INCLUDING \u201cHOMEOPATHIC, NATUROPATHIC, OR HERBALIST.\u201d  BETWEEN 5.3% AND 5.8% OF THE SURVEY GROUP AT ANY ONE TIME REPORTED THAT THEY HAD SEEN A COMPLEMENTARY OR ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE PROVIDER. BASED ON THE US POPULATION OF ~328,000,000, THIS SUGGESTS BETWEEN 17.4 MILLION AND 19.0 MILLION AMERICANS ARE SEEKING AN ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL AT ANY GIVEN TIME.  MEANWHILE THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, IN AN APRIL 2011 NCHS DATA BRIEF, REPORTED THAT MORE THAN 50% OF THE POPULATION USES DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER. DETAILED FINDINGS FROM THAT REPORT INCLUDED.  \u00b7  USE OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS IS COMMON AMONG THE U.S. ADULT POPULATION. OVER 40% USED SUPPLEMENTS IN 1988\u20131994, AND OVER ONE-HALF IN 2003\u20132006.  \u00b7  MULTIVITAMINS/MULTIMINERALS ARE THE MOST COMMONLY USED DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS, WITH APPROXIMATELY 40% OF MEN AND WOMEN REPORTING USE DURING 2003\u20132006.  \u00b7  USE OF SUPPLEMENTAL CALCIUM INCREASED FROM 28% DURING 1988\u20131994 TO 61% DURING 2003\u20132006 AMONG WOMEN AGED 60 AND OVER.  STATUS OF OPERATIONS; CONSUMER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND SALES  MORE THAN 150 MILLION AMERICANS DRINK TEA EVERY DAY, AMOUNTING TO SOME 79 BILLION SERVINGS OF TEA IN AMERICA EVERY YEAR. OUR LAUNCH OF VIPOVATM TEA BRAND IS MEANT TO TAP INTO THIS EXISTING DEMAND. PART OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY IS TO BUILD NATIONAL BRANDS THROUGH PRODUCTS THAT LARGE GROUPS OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR AND COMFORTABLE WITH.  POVIVA TEA CORP. HAS FILED MULTIPLE PATENTS PENDING AND HAS RECEIVED SEVERAL GRANTED PATENTS TO BIND ACTIVE HEMP OIL INGREDIENTS WITH A LIPID, POTENTIALLY ALLOWING FOR MORE EFFICIENT AND COMFORTING DELIVERY OF THE CBD.  LEXARIA BEGAN PRODUCING CASH FLOWS FROM ITS PRODUCTS IN JANUARY 2015; FOCUSED ON THE IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HEMP-OIL-SECTORS THAT ARE FEDERALLY LEGAL. CANNABINOIDS HAVE BEEN FOUND BY MANY RESEARCHERS TO HAVE ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES AND LEXARIA PLANS TO USE THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  PATENTED PROCESS TO INFUSE HEMP OILS INTO A NUMBER OF POPULAR FOOD AND BEVERAGES.  22  LEXARIA HAS LAUNCHED A LINE OF PREMIUM PRODUCTS, ALWAYS RELYING ON OUR DEHYDRATECH  TM  PATENTED INFUSION PROCESS, TO BRING HEMP OIL INTO THE MAINSTREAM. BECAUSE HEMP OIL DOES NOT HAVE PSYCHOACTIVE PROPERTIES WE EXPECT OUR PRODUCTS TO APPEAL TO THE WIDEST POSSIBLE CUSTOMER BASE. TO DATE WE WILL FOCUS OUR SALES EFFORTS ACROSS THE CONTINENTAL USA. SOME STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT 3% OF THE CANADIAN POPULATION REGULARLY CONSUMES HEMP FOOD PRODUCTS, WHILE 1% OF THE AMERICAN POPULATION REGULARLY CONSUMES HEMP FOOD PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THE CONSUMPTION OF HEMP BASED FOOD PRODUCTS OFFERS EXCEPTIONAL GROWTH POSSIBILITIES.  ACCORDING TO NUTRITION BUSINESS JOURNAL, THE ORGANIC FOOD SECTOR WAS A $246 BILLION INDUSTRY IN THE USA DURING 2014, WHILE DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS WAS A $34.6 BILLION INDUSTRY. ACCORDING TO ARCVIEW, LEGAL CANNABIS WAS A $4.7 BILLION US INDUSTRY IN 2015 AND EXPECTED TO GROW TO OVER A $20 BILLION SECTOR BEFORE 2025 BUT IS CLEARLY A MUCH SMALLER INDUSTRY SECTOR THAN THE MORE ESTABLISHED FOOD SECTORS. LEXARIA HAS NOT YET DETERMINED WHETHER OUR HEMP OIL-INFUSED PRODUCTS WILL BE ACCEPTED INTO ANY OR ALL THREE OF THESE PARTICULAR SECTORS.  LEXARIA HAS A MAIN CORPORATE WEBSITE AS WELL AS SMALLER E-COMMERCE FOCUSED WEBSITES DEVOTED TO CONSUMER PRODUCTS. THE MAJORITY OF PRODUCT SALES HAVE TAKEN PLACE THROUGH THE E-COMMERCE WEBSITES. A CONTRACTED NATIONAL DISTRIBUTION CENTER ENSURES RAPID AND ACCURATE FULFILLMENT OF ALL ORDERS. A 1-800 ORDERING CENTER HAS ALSO BEEN PLACED INTO OPERATION.  LEXARIA HAD PREVIOUSLY LAUNCHED THE \u201cLEXARIA ENERGY\u201d BRAND THAT IS 100% OWNED BY THE COMPANY. UNDER THIS BRAND, THE COMPANY PLANS TO DEVELOP HEMP OIL-INFUSED FOOD PRODUCTS FOR PEOPLE WITH ACTIVE LIFESTYLES, SUCH AS PROTEIN BARS, PROTEIN SHAKES AND OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS. ON NOVEMBER 3, 2015, LEXARIA ENERGY10 PROTEIN BARS BECAME AVAILABLE FOR RETAIL SALES WITH TWO FLAVORS. THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT MANUFACTURER OF THESE PROTEIN BARS WAS UNABLE TO FULFILL ADDITIONAL ORDERS AND WE HAVE NOT CURRENTLY BEEN ABLE TO LOCATE AND CONTRACT AN ALTERNATIVE LOCATION TO MANUFACTURE THIS MORE COMPLICATED FOOD PRODUCT, WITH THE RESULT THAT THE PRODUCT IS TEMPORARILY DISCONTINUED WHILE WE SEARCH FOR A SUITABLE MANUFACTURING LOCATION.  THROUGH THE NOVEMBER 2014 ACQUISITION OF 51% OF POVIVA TEA LLC, AND OCTOBER 2017 100% ACQUISITION, LEXARIA ACQUIRED CONTROL OF CERTAIN PATENTS PENDING WITH THE UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE. LEXARIA HAS WORKED TO BROADEN THE PATENTS AND EXTEND THEIR UTILITY TO MOLECULES OTHER THAN THOSE ORIGINALLY NAMED.  ON JUNE 11, 2015, LEXARIA INITIATED THE SIMULTANEOUS FILING OF A U.S. UTILITY PATENT APPLICATION AND AN INTERNATIONAL PATENT APPLICATION UNDER THE PATENT COOPERATION TREATY (PCT) PROCEDURE, BOTH AT THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (\u201cUSPTO\u201d). THESE APPLICATIONS FOLLOW THE COMPANY\u2019S 2014 AND 2015 FAMILY OF PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION FILINGS IN THE U.S. AND SERVE TWO ADDITIONAL BROAD PURPOSES.  1)  LEXARIA IS SEEKING PROTECTION OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY UNDER INTERNATIONAL TREATIES. TO THIS END LEXARIA HAS FILED FOR PCT PATENT APPLICATION PROTECTION. THERE ARE 148 COUNTRIES THAT ARE SIGNATORIES TO THE PATENT COOPERATION TREATY, INCLUDING SUCH MAJOR MARKETS AS CANADA, CHINA, INDIA, MUCH OF EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND JAPAN AMONG OTHERS.  2)  LEXARIA BELIEVES ITS LIPID INFUSION TECHNOLOGY HAS APPLICATIONS BEYOND THE DELIVERY OF JUST CANNABINOIDS. BASED ON FURTHER FORMULATION TESTING, LEXARIA HAS INCLUDED ADDITIONAL LIPOPHILIC MOLECULES THAT MAY BE DELIVERED VIA FOOD AND BEVERAGE FORMATS UTILIZING ITS TECHNOLOGY, WIDELY ENCOMPASSING THREE MAJOR NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COMPANY: NICOTINE; NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES (NSAIDS); AND VITAMINS.  IN DECEMBER 2015, THE COMPANY FILED TWO FURTHER PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATIONS IN THE U.S. THESE NEW APPLICATIONS SERVED TO FURTHER BROADEN THE VARIETY AND APPLICABILITY OF BASE COMPOUNDS THAT CAN BE USED WHEN FORMULATING THE COMPANY\u2019S LIPID BASED TECHNOLOGY. THE FIRST OF THESE APPLICATIONS IDENTIFY COMPOUNDS LIKE EDIBLE STARCHES (E.G., TAPIOCA STARCH) THAT ARE COMMONLY USED IN FOOD PRODUCTS TODAY AND COULD, THEREFORE, SERVE AS A BASE FOR FORMULATING AND INCORPORATING THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY INTO A WIDE VARIETY OF EVERY DAY FOOD PRODUCTS. THE SECOND OF THESE APPLICATIONS IDENTIFY EMULSIFIER COMPOUNDS LIKE GUM ARABIC THAT ARE COMMONLY USED IN BEVERAGE PRODUCTS TODAY IN ORDER TO FACILITATE SIMILAR FLEXIBILITY FOR FORMULATING THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY IN EVERY DAY, SHELF-STABLE BEVERAGES.  23  ON OCTOBER 26, 2016, THE USPTO ISSUED U.S PATENT NO. 9474725, CANNABINOID INFUSED FOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF, PERTAINING TO OUR METHOD OF IMPROVING BIOAVAILABILITY AND TASTE OF CERTAIN CANNABINOID LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS IN FOOD PRODUCTS. THIS IS THE COMPANY\u2019S FIRST PATENT GRANTED AND HAS A PUBLISH DATE OF OCTOBER 27, 2016 (JUNE 15 2017 IN AUSTRALIA NO. 2015274698) AND PROTECTS OUR TECHNOLOGY FOR TWENTY YEARS. ON DECEMBER 12, 2017, THE USPTO GRANTED PATENT NUMBER US 9,839,612 B2 FOR THE USE OF DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY AS A DELIVERY PLATFORM. ON MAY 22, 2018 PATENT US 9,974,739 B2, \u201cFOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS INFUSED WITH LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\u201d WAS GRANTED PROVIDING FOR \u201cCOMPOSITION OF MATTER\u201d CLAIMS THAT PROTECT THE SPECIFIC COMBINATION OF SUBSTANCES WHICH ENABLE IMPROVED TASTE AND BIOABSORPTION PROPERTIES OF ITS DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY FOR THE DELIVERY OF CANNABINOIDS. ON MAY 15, 2018 PATENT US 9,972,680 B2, \u201cFOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS INFUSED WITH LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\u201d WAS GRANTED PROVIDING CLAIMS THAT PROTECT PROCESSES FOR MAKING SPECIFIC COMPOSITIONS OF MATTER FOR ENHANCED CANNABINOID DELIVERY UTILIZING ITS DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY. ON AUGUST 31, 2018 AUSTRALIAN PATENTS 2017203054, 2018202562, AND 2018202583 WERE GRANTED. ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2018 THE USPTO GRANTED US 10,084,044 B2 AND ON OCTOBER16, 2018 US 10,103,225 B2 WITHIN THE SAME PATENT FAMILY.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT KNOW AND CANNOT KNOW WHETHER THESE STRATEGIES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL, OR IF SUCCESSFUL, HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO GAIN CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE AND CUSTOMER LOYALTY. IT CAN BE A CHALLENGE TO BE SUCCESSFUL BY INTRODUCING NEW CONSUMER PRODUCTS TO A COMPETITIVE RETAIL MARKETPLACE, AND WE CAN OFFER NO ASSURANCES THAT OUR PRODUCTS WILL BE A COMMERCIAL SUCCESS.  INTERNATIONAL PATENT PROTECTION  WHEN LEXARIA FIRST BEGAN EXAMINING THE LEGAL MEDICAL CANNABIS MARKET IN 2013, AND ENTERED THE MARKET IN 2014, THE COMPANY BELIEVED IT COULD MAKE AN IMPACT IN PERHAPS BOTH THE CANADIAN AND U.S. MARKETPLACES. OUR PURSUIT AND DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY HAS EXPANDED OUR POTENTIAL AREA OF IMPACT, BOTH GEOGRAPHICALLY AND BY SECTOR. BECAUSE OF THE APPLICABILITY OF OUR TECHNOLOGY TO MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE LEGAL CANNABIS SECTOR, WE HAVE TAKEN THE NECESSARY STEPS TO PROTECT THAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WITHIN LARGER GLOBAL MARKETS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY LIE WITHIN THE MEDICAL CANNABIS SECTOR OR IN OTHER UNRELATED SECTORS.  ADDITIONAL MOLECULES  NICOTINE.  MORE THAN 99% OF ALL NICOTINE THAT IS CONSUMED WORLDWIDE IS DELIVERED THROUGH SMOKING CIGARETTES. APPROXIMATELY 6,000,000 DEATHS PER YEAR, WORLDWIDE, ARE ATTRIBUTED PRIMARILY TO THE DELIVERY OF NICOTINE THROUGH THE ACT OF SMOKING ACCORDING TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, WHICH ALSO ESTIMATES THAT OVER $170 BILLION PER YEAR IS SPENT JUST IN THE USA ON DIRECT MEDICAL CARE COSTS FOR ADULT SMOKERS. 69% OF U.S. ADULT SMOKERS WANT TO QUIT SMOKING AND 43% OF US ADULT SMOKERS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO QUIT IN ANY TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD.  WORLDWIDE, RETAIL CIGARETTE SALES WERE WORTH $722 BILLION IN 2013, WITH OVER 5.7 TRILLION CIGARETTES SOLD TO MORE THAN 1 BILLION SMOKERS.  RELEVANCE  : LEXARIA POSTULATES THAT DELIVERY OF NICOTINE TO SATISFY CURRENT DEMAND, UTILIZING OUR PATENTED LIPID-DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY IN COMMON FOOD GROUPS, COULD SHIFT DEMAND FROM SMOKING CIGARETTES TO ALTERNATIVE NICOTINE-BASED FOOD PRODUCTS. SINCE MOST OF THE ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF NICOTINE CONSUMPTION ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELIVERY METHOD AND ONLY TO A LESSER DEGREE TO THE ACTUAL INGESTION OF NICOTINE, THERE COULD BE A VAST POSITIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH OUTCOME THROUGH THE REDUCTION IN SMOKING CIGARETTES. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND REGULATORY COMPLIANT INVESTIGATIONS WOULD NEED TO BE CONDUCTED BEFORE OTHERWISE HEALTHY FOODS SUCH AS TEA, COFFEE OR ENERGY BAR SNACKS CONTAINING NICOTINE COULD BE INTRODUCED. NICOTINE IS A NAMED MOLECULE IN THE LATEST LEXARIA PATENT APPLICATIONS.  NSAID  . NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES ARE THE SECOND-LARGEST CATEGORY OF PAIN MANAGEMENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN THE WORLD. THE GLOBAL PAIN MANAGEMENT MARKET WAS ESTIMATED AT $22 BILLION IN 2011, WITH $5.4 BILLION OF THIS MARKET BEING SERVED BY NSAID\u2019S. THE U.S. MAKES UP OVER ONE-HALF OF THE GLOBAL MARKET. THE OPIOIDS MARKET (SUCH AS MORPHINE) FORM THE LARGEST SINGLE PAIN MANAGEMENT SECTOR BUT ARE KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SERIOUS DEPENDENCE AND TOLERANCE ISSUES.  24  SOME OF THE MOST COMMONLY KNOWN NSAIDS ARE ASA (ASPIRIN), IBUPROFEN (ADVIL, MOTRIN), AND ACETAMINOPHEN (TYLENOL). (ACETAMINOPHEN IS NOT ACCEPTED BY ALL PERSONS TO BE AN NSAID.) ALTHOUGH NSAIDS ARE GENERALLY A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT METHOD FOR PAIN, THEY HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH A NUMBER OF GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS INCLUDING DYSPEPSIA AND GASTRIC BLEEDING.  RELEVANCE  : LEXARIA POSTULATES THAT DELIVERY OF NSAIDS THROUGH A LIPID-BASED MECHANISM COULD PROVIDE THE BENEFICIAL PROPERTIES OF PAIN RELIEF WITH LESSENED NEGATIVE GASTROINTESTINAL EFFECTS, AND ALSO POTENTIALLY DELIVER LOWER DOSAGES OF ACTIVE INGREDIENTS WITH SIMILAR PAIN MANAGEMENT OUTCOMES AS CURRENT PILL FORMS AT HIGHER DOSAGES. ASA, PIROXICAM, DICLOFENAC, INDOMETHACIN, IBUPROFEN, AND ACETAMINOPHEN ARE ALL NAMED MOLECULES IN THE LATEST LEXARIA PATENT APPLICATIONS.  VITAMINS.  THE GLOBAL VITAMIN AND SUPPLEMENT MARKET IS WORTH $68 BILLION ACCORDING TO EUROMONITOR. THE CATEGORY IS BOTH BROAD AND DEEP, COMPRISED OF MANY POPULAR AND SOME LESSER KNOWN SUBSTANCES. VITAMINS IN GENERAL ARE THOUGHT TO BE AN $8.5 BILLION ANNUAL MARKET IN THE U.S. THE U.S. IS THE LARGEST SINGLE NATIONAL MARKET IN THE WORLD, AND CHINA AND JAPAN ARE THE 2  ND  AND 3  RD  LARGEST VITAMIN MARKETS.  VITAMIN E IS FAT SOLUBLE AND CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO CELL MEMBRANES WHICH CAN PROTECT THEM FROM OXIDATIVE DAMAGE. GLOBAL CONSUMPTION OF NATURAL SOURCE VITAMIN E WAS 10,900 METRIC TONS IN 2013 WORTH $611.9 MILLION.  RELEVANCE  : LEXARIA POSTULATES THAT DELIVERY OF FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS THROUGH ITS PATENTED LIPID-BASED DELIVERY MECHANISM MAY RESULT IN LESS WASTE AND LOWER DOSAGES REQUIRED THAN MOST CURRENT PILL FORMS. AS WELL, INGESTION OF PILLS IS AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE FOR MANY PEOPLE SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT VITAMIN DELIVERY THROUGH COMMON FOOD GROUPS COULD VASTLY EXPAND MARKET DEMAND FOR THIS SECTOR. VITAMIN E IS A NAMED MOLECULE IN THE LATEST LEXARIA PATENT APPLICATIONS.  ON AUGUST 11, 2015, LEXARIA SIGNED A LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH POVIVA TEA LLC FOR $10,000, GRANTING LEXARIA A 35-YEAR NON EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE LICENSE TO UNENCUMBERED USE OF POVIVA TEA LLC\u2019S IP RIGHTS, INCLUDING RIGHTS OF RESALE. THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ENSURES LEXARIA HAS FULL ACCESS TO THE UNDERLYING INFUSION TECHNOLOGY.  SCIENTIFIC TESTING AND VALIDATION  ON AUGUST 24, 2015, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED POTENTIAL INDUSTRY-CHANGING ACHIEVEMENTS IN ENHANCED GASTRO-INTESTINAL ABSORPTION OF CANNABIDIOL (CBD) UTILIZING LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY. THE THIRD-PARTY TESTING WAS CONDUCTED IN TWO PHASES OF  IN VITRO  TESTS BEGINNING IN JUNE AND COMPLETED IN AUGUST, 2015.  THE INDEPENDENT LABORATORY RESULTS DELIVERED AVERAGE CBD PERMEABILITY OF 499% OF BASELINE PERMEABILITY, COMPARED TO CBD PERMEABILITY WITHOUT LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY. THESE RESULTS EXCEED COMPANY EXPECTATIONS. THIS WAS ASSESSED IN A STRICTLY CONTROLLED,  IN VITRO  EXPERIMENT USING A HUMAN INTESTINAL TISSUE MODEL. SAMPLES OF LEXARIA\u2019S COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CBD-FORTIFIED VIPOVATM BLACK TEA WERE ADMINISTERED IN THE MODEL COMPARED WITH CONCENTRATION-MATCHED CBD CONTROL PREPARATIONS THAT LACKED LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED FORMULATION AND PROCESS ENHANCEMENTS. LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT ITS  IN VITRO  FINDINGS PROVIDE COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF THE INTESTINAL ABSORPTION ENHANCING CAPABILITIES OF ITS TECHNOLOGY, BASED ON WHICH IT IS EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES TO PROGRESS TO MORE ADVANCED, FOLLOW-ON BIOAVAILABILITY TESTING IN ANIMALS.  THE TESTS ALSO SHOWED 325% OF BASELINE GASTRO-INTESTINAL PERMEABILITY OF CBD COMPARING LEXARIA\u2019S CBD-FORTIFIED VIPOVATM BLACK TEA TO A SECOND CONTROL OF CBD AND BLACK TEA COMBINED,  WITHOUT  LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED FORMULATION ENHANCEMENTS. THIS CONFIRMED THAT THE SPECIALIZED PROCESSING UNDERTAKEN BY LEXARIA DURING ITS MANUFACTURING PROCESS TOGETHER WITH ITS FORMULATION ENHANCEMENTS, DOES INDEED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE ABSORPTION LEVELS.  THE BIOAVAILABILITY OF CBD (OR OF THC) VARIES GREATLY BY DELIVERY METHOD. SMOKING TYPICALLY DELIVERS CANNABINOIDS AT AN AVERAGE BIOAVAILABILITY RATE OF 30% (HUESTIS (2007) CHEM. BIODIVERS. 4:1770\u20131804; MCGILVERAY (2005) PAIN RES. MANAG. 10 SUPPL. A:15A \u2013 22A). BY COMPARISON, ORALLY CONSUMED CANNABIS EDIBLES TYPICALLY DELIVER CANNABINOIDS AT AN AVERAGE BIOAVAILABILITY RATE OF ONLY 5% (KARSCHNER ET AL. (2011) CLIN. CHEM. 57:66\u201375).  25  THE COMPANY\u2019S PRESENT FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ITS TECHNOLOGY MAY ACHIEVE A 5-FOLD IMPROVEMENT IN CANNABINOID ABSORPTION IN EDIBLE FORM OVER THAT WHICH CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT ITS PROPRIETARY PROCESS AND FORMULATION ENHANCEMENTS. THIS CONCEPTUALLY SUPPORTS THAT LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGH IN CANNABINOID DELIVERY BY APPROXIMATING THE HIGH ABSORPTION LEVELS ACHIEVED AS THOUGH THROUGH ADMINISTRATION BY SMOKING, BUT WITHOUT THE ASSOCIATED NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH CAUSED BY SMOKING.  THE TESTS WERE COMPLETED IN TWO PHASES CULMINATING WITH TESTING USING SIMULATED INTESTINAL FLUID CONDITIONS THAT DELIVERED THESE FINDINGS. THESE RESULTS WERE STRONGER THAN EARLIER ITERATIONS OF THE TESTS THAT DID NOT USE A SIMULATED INTESTINAL FLUID ENVIRONMENT AND CONTRIBUTED TO LEXARIA\u2019S UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS AT WORK. FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS, LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT BIOAVAILABILITY TESTING IN ANIMALS IS LIKELY TO YIELD EVEN STRONGER ABSORPTION RESULTS IN THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL INTESTINAL FLUID CONDITIONS.  CBD HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY FOUND TO PROVIDE BENEFICIAL PAIN RELIEVING, ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, ANTI-ANXIETY, NEUROPROTECTION, ANTI-PSYCHOTIC, AND ANTI-CONVULSIVE EFFECTS AMONG OTHERS. LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED TECHNOLOGY COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE INDIVIDUAL SERVING REQUIREMENTS FOR CBD TO CONSUMERS. THIS COULD LEAD TO REDUCED COSTS OF CONSUMPTION FOR CONSUMERS AND INCREASED PROFITABILITY FOR LEXARIA.  LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT THE SAME TECHNOLOGY USED TO ENHANCE THE ABSORPTION OF CBD IN THE RECENT LABORATORY TESTS, IS APPLICABLE TO THC, NICOTINE, NSAIDS AND OTHER LIPOPHILIC COMPOUNDS THAT ARE WIDELY USED TODAY.  DURING JANUARY 2015, LEXARIA CONDUCTED A STUDY OF NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS IN HUMANS, AS A BIOMARKER FOR ABSORPTION OF CANNABIDIOL, WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE OF THE EFFICIENT ABSORPTION OF CANNABIDIOL FROM LEXARIA FOOD PRODUCTS ENHANCED WITH HEMP OIL, BY DEMONSTRATING THE ELEVATION OF NITRIC OXIDE IN THE HUMAN BODY IN RESPONSE TO PRODUCT INGESTION.  THE STUDY DATA FROM HUMAN SUBJECTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT ELEVATION OF SYSTEMIC NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS AS A SURROGATE BIOMARKER FOR CANNABIDIOL (CBD) BIOABSORPTION IN RESPONSE TO INGESTION OF LEXARIA\u2019S PRODUCTS. THIS PROVIDED CLINICAL SUPPORT FOR THE CBD BIOAVAILABILITY ENHANCING PROPERTIES OF LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED TECHNOLOGY, ON THE PREMISE THAT BIOAVAILABLE CBD IS KNOWN TO ELEVATE LEVELS OF THE ENDOCANNABINOID ANANDAMIDE IN THE HUMAN BODY WHICH, IN TURN, STIMULATES RELEASE OF NITRIC OXIDE IN THE VASCULAR SYSTEM.  IN SUMMARY, CONSUMING LEXARIA AND VIPOVATM FOOD PRODUCTS RESULTED IN ELEVATED LEVELS OF NITRIC OXIDE WITHIN THE BODY. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY INDICATED THAT ALL LEXARIA AND VIPOVATM FOOD PRODUCTS ELICITED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SALIVARY NITRIC OXIDE, ACHIEVING LEVELS FROM 110 \u039cM TO AS HIGH AS 220 \u039cM IN THE TEST SUBJECTS. THE BEVERAGE PRODUCTS GENERALLY HAD FASTER INITIAL RESPONSES IN AS LITTLE AS 15 MINUTES AFTER PRODUCT INGESTION, WHEREAS THE INITIAL RESPONSES FROM THE PROTEIN-ENERGY BARS REQUIRED 30 MINUTES. THE FASTER RESPONSE TIME WITH THE BEVERAGE PRODUCTS WAS TO BE EXPECTED, GIVEN THE RELATIVE EASE OF DIGESTING LIQUIDS VERSUS SOLIDS. ALL PRODUCTS SUSTAINED THEIR MAXIMUM LEVELS OF NITRIC OXIDE DETECTION THROUGH TO THE 60-MINUTE END-POINTS USED IN THE STUDY, INDICATING A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL STUDY TO DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS REMAIN ELEVATED FOLLOWING PRODUCTION CONSUMPTION.  THE STUDY ASSESSED SIX FLAVORS OF VIPOVATM TEA (YUNAN BLACK, HERBAL CHERRY BLACK, EARL GREY, HERBAL BENGAL CHAI, HERBAL MASALA CHAI AND DECAF ENGLISH BREAKFAST), VIPOVATM COLUMBIAN SUPREMO COFFEE, VIPOVATM HOT CHOCOLATE AND LEXARIA ENERGY FOODS\u2019 CHOCOLATE BERRY DATE AND CASHEW BERRY DATE PROTEIN-ENERGY BARS.  SIX HEALTHY HUMAN SUBJECTS (3 MALE AND 3 FEMALE) BETWEEN THE AGES OF 22 AND 65 YEARS OF AGE WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY. SUBJECTS WERE SCREENED FOR CARDIOVASCULAR AND ALLERGIC RESPONSE TO HEMP PRODUCTS, WERE NON-SMOKERS AND DID NOT HAVE ANY HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE OR ALCOHOL ABUSE. ONE PRODUCT WAS STUDIED PER DAY ACROSS ALL SIX SUBJECTS, WITH EACH SUBJECT CONSUMING A FULL PRODUCT SERVING SIZE. SUBJECTS WERE REQUIRED TO REFRAIN FROM EATING FOOD OR USING VAPE PRODUCTS FOR AT LEAST 12 HOURS BEFORE TEST ARTICLE ADMINISTRATION ON EACH DAY OF THE STUDY. NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS IN THE TEST SUBJECTS WERE ASSESSED USING A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE, COLORIMETRIC TEST KIT DESIGNED TO QUANTIFY SYSTEMIC NITRIC OXIDE VIA A DETECTABLE SALIVARY MARKER. IMMEDIATELY BEFORE TEST ARTICLE ADMINISTRATION EACH DAY, ALL SUBJECTS WERE REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE A NEGATIVE BASELINE NITRIC OXIDE SALIVA TEST. SUBJECTS WERE CONSIDERED TO HAVE A NEGATIVE TEST STRIP READING AT A LEVEL OF 20 \u039cM ACCORDING TO THE TEST STRIP SCALE, AND POSITIVE READINGS ANYWHERE ABOVE THIS. SUBJECTS PERFORMED SALIVARY NITRIC OXIDE TESTING AT 15, 30, 45 AND 60 MINUTES\u2019 POST-CONSUMPTION OF EACH PRODUCT. ALL SUBJECTS REMAINED SEDENTARY FROM BASELINE THROUGH TO THE COMPLETION OF TESTING FOR EACH PRODUCT.  26  IN AUGUST OF 2018 WE RELEASED RESULTS FROM OUR TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES IN A RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, DOUBLE-BLIND EUROPEAN HUMAN CLINICAL STUDY THAT EVALUATED TURBOCBD  TM  - A PROPRIETARY, DEHYDRATECHTM POWERED, CANNABIDIOL (\u201cCBD\u201d) FORTIFIED HEMP OIL CAPSULE DEVELOPED BY LEXARIA. THE DEGREE AND SPEED OF CBD ABSORPTION INTO BLOOD PLASMA AND POTENTIAL CARDIOVASCULAR AND COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT IN 12 HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS WERE STUDIED.  KEY BIOAVAILABILITY DATA HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE STUDY COMPARING THE 90 MG DOSE OF LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM TO A 90 MG DOSE OF A POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION WITHOUT LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY WERE AS FOLLOWS.  \u00b7  30 MINUTES: CBD DELIVERED FROM LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES WAS ABSORBED MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN FROM THE POSITIVE CONTROL, DELIVERING 317% MORE CBD TO BLOOD AT THE 30-MINUTE MARK OF THE STUDY (I.E., 18.4 NG/ML COMPARED TO ONLY 4.4 NG/ML ON AVERAGE RESPECTIVELY [95% CI; P=0.051]);  \u00b7  60 MINUTES: THE TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES WENT ON TO DELIVER MORE CBD TO THE BLOOD AT THE 60-MINUTE MARK (I.E., 38.8 NG/ML) THAN THE POSITIVE CONTROL CAPSULES WERE ABLE TO REACH AT ANY TIME DURING THE 6-HOUR STUDY, FURTHER DEMONSTRATING THE EXCEPTIONAL RAPIDITY OF ACTION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TURBOCBDTM CAPSULES;  \u00b7  90 MINUTES: THE TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES FURTHER WENT ON TO DELIVER SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CBD TO THE BLOOD (86% MORE) THAN THE POSITIVE CONTROL CAPSULES AT THE 90-MINUTE MARK (I.E., 53.0 NG/ML COMPARED TO ONLY 28.4 NG/ML RESPECTIVELY [95% CI; P=0.034]);  \u00b7  THROUGH TO STUDY COMPLETION: LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES CONTINUED TO DELIVER MORE CBD TO BLOOD THAN THE POSITIVE CONTROL CAPSULES AT EACH SUBSEQUENT TIME POINT IN THE STUDY THROUGH TO THE 6-HOUR MARK WHEN THE STUDY WAS COMPLETED.  THESE RESULTS CORROBORATE AND CONFIRM OTHER IN VITRO AND IN VIVO STUDIES THAT HAVE EVALUATED LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY. ALTHOUGH THIS STUDY EVALUATED ABSORPTION ONLY OF CBD AND ITS METABOLITES, LEXARIA BELIEVES NEARLY IDENTICAL BIOAVAILABILITY ENHANCEMENT RESULTS WOULD BE ACHIEVED WITH OTHER CANNABINOIDS.  WE HAVE ALSO COMPLETED OUR FIRST STUDY EVALUATING DEHYDRATECH  TM  USED IN A TOPICAL CREAM FORMULATION FOR ABSORPTION OF CBD THROUGH HUMAN SKIN. RESULTS PROVED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN BOTH SPEED AND QUANTITY OF CBD ABSORPTION THROUGH SKIN WHEN COMPARED TO CONTROL FORMULATIONS. THE ABSORPTION STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON HUMAN SKIN AT A CALIFORNIA-BASED LABORATORY THAT SPECIALIZES IN FRANZ DIFFUSION CELL SKIN PERMEABILITY TESTING. LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY WAS USED TOGETHER WITH A SOPHISTICATED OIL-IN-WATER EMULSION FORMULATION DESIGN AND COMPARED TO A SERIES OF MATCHING OIL-IN-WATER EMULSION FORMULATIONS PREPARED WITH THE SAME CBD INPUTS, WITH AND WITHOUT THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY AND WITH AND WITHOUT TWO LEADING SKIN PENETRATION ENHANCERS CURRENTLY USED IN THE SKIN PRODUCTS INDUSTRY. SEVERAL FACTORS WERE MEASURED, INCLUDING THE TIME REQUIRED TO DETECT CBD SKIN PENETRATION AND QUANTITY, AND PEAK AMOUNTS OF CBD ABSORBED INTO AND THROUGH THE SKIN, AT MULTIPLE TESTING INTERVALS OVER A 48-HOUR DURATION.  LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  -ENABLED TOPICAL FORMULATION, ABSENT EITHER OF THE COMMERCIAL PENETRATION ENHANCERS, WAS THE FASTEST ACTING FOR ABSORPTION INTO THE EPIDERMIS, DERMIS OR THROUGH THE SKIN INTO THE SYSTEMIC FRACTION REPRESENTING PERMEATION INTO THE UNDERLYING CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  -ENABLED PRODUCT ALSO HAD NO ODOUR EVEN WITHOUT THE USE OF PERFUMES, CONTRARY TO OTHER CANNABINOID INDUSTRY PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE QUITE STRONGLY ODORIFEROUS WITHOUT THE USE OF MASKING PERFUMES.  FURTHERMORE, LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  -ENABLED TOPICAL FORMULATION WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF EITHER OF THE COMMERCIAL PENETRATION ENHANCERS, DEMONSTRATED THE HIGHEST OVERALL AVERAGE QUANTITY OF CBD DELIVERED THROUGH THE SKIN AND INTO THE REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEMIC FRACTION OF ALL THE FORMULATIONS TESTED, WITH AS MUCH AS A 225% INCREASE IN CBD PERMEABILITY WHEN COMPARED TO THE HIGHEST PERFORMING COMMERCIAL PENETRATION ENHANCER FORMULATION ASSESSED AND ALMOST A 1,900% INCREASE IN CBD PERMEABILITY WHEN COMPARED TO A CONTROL FORMULATION THAT WAS DEVOID OF BOTH THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY OR ANY COMMERCIAL PENETRATION ENHANCERS. THE COMMERCIAL SKIN PENETRATION ENHANCERS ONLY DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE THAT WAS ON PAR OR SUPERIOR TO THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  -ENABLED FORMULATIONS TESTED IN SO FAR AS TOTAL CBD ABSORPTION INTO THE SHALLOW EPIDERMIS OR DERMIS WAS CONCERNED.  27  WE HAVE ALSO COMPLETED OUR FIRST INGESTIBLE NICOTINE IN VIVO (ANIMAL) ABSORPTION STUDY. LEXARIA IS PURSUING THE USE OF ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY AS A POSSIBLE NEW NICOTINE DELIVERY METHOD, AN EDIBLE DOSE ABSORBED THROUGH THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT, WITH POTENTIAL BOTH AS A NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY AS WELL AS AN ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT FORMAT FOR REGULAR TOBACCO USERS.  DEHYDRATECH  TM  DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING MAJOR NICOTINE ABSORPTION PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS: 1,160% FASTER DELIVERY OF EQUIVALENT PEAK QUANTITIES OF NICOTINE TO THE BLOODSTREAM THAN ACHIEVED WITH CONTROLS (WITHIN 15 MIN VS. 2.9 HOURS), 148% GAIN IN THE QUANTITY OF PEAK NICOTINE DELIVERY TO THE BLOODSTREAM RELATIVE TO CONTROLS, 560% HIGHER BRAIN LEVELS OF NICOTINE WHERE NICOTINE EFFECTS ARE FOCUSED, COMPARED TO CONTROLS, LOWER URINE LEVELS OF NICOTINE EXCRETED THAN CONTROLS, FOR ENHANCED NICOTINE ACTIVITY AND BIOAVAILABILITY OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY, LOWER QUANTITIES OF KEY LIVER METABOLITES IN THE BLOODSTREAM THAN CONTROLS AS HYPOTHESIZED, SUGGESTING BYPASS OF FIRST PASS LIVER METABOLISM.  STUDY DESIGN PARAMETERS.  THE STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO PRINCIPALLY ASSESS THE RELATIVE INGESTIBLE NICOTINE ABSORPTION PERFORMANCE OF DEHYDRATECH  TM  -POWERED FORMULATIONS COMPARED TO CONCENTRATION-MATCHED CONTROL FORMULATIONS THAT LACKED ANY FORM OF DELIVERY ENABLING TECHNOLOGY IN RATS. NICOTINE WAS ADMINISTERED IN A NICOTINE POLACRILEX DERIVATIVE FORMAT AS IS WIDELY COMMERCIALIZED TODAY IN NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY PRODUCTS SUCH AS CHEWING GUMS. TWELVE MALE RATS WERE DIVIDED INTO FOUR GROUPS OF THREE, SUCH THAT DEHYDRATECH  TM  AND CONTROL FORMULATIONS WERE EACH TESTED AT A 1 MG/KG AND 10 MG/KG DOSAGE LEVEL. FORMULATIONS WERE ADMINISTERED ORALLY AND ALL RATS WERE CANNULATED FOR BLOOD COLLECTION AT MULTIPLE INTERVALS OVER AN 8 HOUR DURATION POST-DOSING WITH THE FIRST DATA COLLECTION AT THE 15-MINUTE MARK. URINE AND FECES WERE ALSO COLLECTED FOR UP TO A 24-HOUR DURATION POST-DOSING, AND ESSENTIAL ORGAN TISSUE SAMPLES WERE ALSO COLLECTED FOR EXAMINATION AFTER THE STUDY. ALL SAMPLES WERE SUBJECTED TO ANALYTICAL TESTING IN ORDER TO QUANTIFY THE LEVELS OF NICOTINE THEREIN, AS WELL AS THE LEVELS OF THREE MAJOR LIVER METABOLITES THEREOF, HYDROXYCOTININE, NICOTINE N\u2019-OXIDE AND COTININE, IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE RELATIVE METABOLITE LEVELS ABSORBED BY THE DIFFERENT FORMULATIONS. LEXARIA\u2019S HYPOTHESIS WAS TESTED TO PROVE THAT ITS DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY WOULD INFLUENCE MORE RAPID AND COMPLETE INTESTINAL BIOABSORPTION OF NICOTINE LYMPHATICALLY WITH LESS METABOLIC DEGRADATION BY THE LIVER. ALL ANIMALS WERE ALSO ASSESSED FOR GENERAL TOLERABILITY OF THE ADMINISTERED FORMULATIONS. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT THE SAME INDEPENDENT LABORATORY IN PHILADELPHIA WHERE THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS INITIAL CANNABIDIOL ABSORPTION STUDY IN 2015.  RESULTS & OBSERVATIONS.  THE LEXARIA FORMULATIONS GENERALLY ACHIEVED FASTER ABSORPTION, HIGHER PEAK ABSORPTION AND HIGHER OVERALL QUANTITIES OF NICOTINE, ON AVERAGE, IN THE BLOOD THAN THE CONCENTRATION-MATCHED CONTROL FORMULATIONS AT BOTH THE 1MG AND 10 MG/KG DOSES TESTED. FURTHERMORE, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THERE WERE NO OBVIOUS SIGNS OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISTRESS SUCH AS VOMITING OR DIARRHEA INDICATING THAT THE ANIMALS APPEARED TO TOLERATE THE TREATMENT WELL.  NICOTINE BLOOD LEVELS WERE EVALUATED MULTIPLE TIMES OVER A PERIOD OF 8 HOURS AFTER DOSING. IN THE 10MG/KG DOSING ARM, THE CONTROL FORMULATION REQUIRED NEARLY 3 HOURS TO REACH SIMILAR LEVELS OF BLOOD ABSORPTION THAT THE LEXARIA FORMULATION REACHED IN ONLY 15 MINUTES. FURTHERMORE, THE LEXARIA FORMULATION WENT ON THEREAFTER TO DEMONSTRATE PEAK PLASMA LEVELS THAT WERE 148% OF THOSE ACHIEVED BY THE CONTROL FORMULATION. IF REPLICATED IN HUMAN STUDIES, THESE FINDINGS ARE SUGGESTIVE THAT LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY COULD PROVE MORE EFFECTIVE IN ELEVATING BLOOD NICOTINE LEVELS THROUGH EDIBLE FORMATS MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND SUBSTANTIALLY THAN PREVIOUSLY THEORIZED, POTENTIALLY MAKING INGESTIBLE NICOTINE PREPARATIONS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO TODAY\u2019S AVAILABLE PRODUCT FORMATS WHILE ALSO LEADING TO A MORE RAPID NICOTINE CRAVING SATIATION.  ANALYSIS OF THE LIVER METABOLITES REVEALED, AS EXPECTED, THAT OVERALL LEVELS IN THE BLOOD OF TWO OF THE THREE METABOLITES STUDIED WERE HIGHER IN THE CONTROL GROUP THAN IN THE LEXARIA FORMULATION GROUP AT THE 10 MG/KG DOSE. THIS RESULT WAS ESPECIALLY PRONOUNCED IN THE 45-MINUTE TO 2-HOUR TIME INTERVAL POST-DOSING WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPECTED TIMING OF RELEASE OF METABOLITES IN HIGHER QUANTITY INTO THE BLOODSTREAM BY THE LIVER FOLLOWING NORMAL PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSING OF INGESTED NICOTINE WITH THE CONTROL PREPARATION, COMPARED TO THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BELIEVED TO ELUDE FIRST PASS LIVER METABOLISM. THE LEXARIA FORMULATION ALSO DEMONSTRATED LOWER QUANTITIES OF NICOTINE IN THE RAT URINE AT BOTH DOSES, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FACT THAT THE LEVELS OF NICOTINE IN THE RAT BLOOD REMAINED HIGHER OVER THE DURATION OF THE STUDY WITH THE LEXARIA FORMULATION THAN WITH THE CONTROL. THE STUDY ALSO REVEALED THAT THE LEXARIA FORMULATION AT THE 10 MG/KG LEVEL ACHIEVED UP TO 5.6-TIMES AS MUCH NICOTINE UPON ANALYSIS OF THE RAT BRAIN TISSUE THAN WAS RECOVERED WITH THE MATCHING CONTROL FORMULATION. THESE FINDINGS TOGETHER PERHAPS SUGGEST PROLONGATION OF NICOTINE EFFECTIVENESS WITH THE LEXARIA FORMULATION WHICH MAY ALSO BE BENEFICIAL IN HUMANS TO CONTROL CRAVINGS OVER AN EXTENDED TIME-PERIOD FROM A SINGLE EDIBLE NICOTINE DOSE.  28  IN OUR FOLLOW-UP THIRD-PARTY  IN VIVO  STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT STUDY, INCLUDING TWO GROUPS OF 20 ANIMALS, FURTHER DEFINING DELIVERY OF NICOTINE IN EDIBLE FORM AT EACH OF THE 2, 4, 6, 8 AND 10-MINUTE INTERVALS POST-DOSING, WITH 90.2% GREATER DELIVERY THAN THE CONCENTRATION-MATCHED CONTROL FORMULATION BY THE 10-MINUTE MARK (95% CI; P=0.044), AND SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER ABSORPTION LEVELS THAN THE CONTROL FORMULATION AT ALL SUBSEQUENT TIME POINTS IN THE STUDY. SPEED OF ONSET IS A KEY ATTRIBUTE FOR ORAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND IT IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF NON-INHALATION NICOTINE DELIVERY FORMATS.  KEY HIGHLIGHTS OF THE FOLLOW-UP STUDY ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u00b7  PEAK LEVEL: 79% IMPROVEMENT IN PEAK BLOOD LEVELS (MAXIMUM CONCENTRATION OR \u201cCMAX\u201d) AT 394 NG/ML USING LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY VS. 220 NG/ML WITH THE CONTROL (95% CI; P=0.0257);  \u00b7  TOTAL QUANTITY: 94% IMPROVEMENT IN TOTAL QUANTITY OF NICOTINE DELIVERED (AREA UNDER THE CURVE OR \u201cAUC\u201d) TO THE BLOOD DURING THE 60-MINUTE COURSE OF THE STUDY, AT 266 HR\u2022NG/ML VERSUS 137 HR\u2022NG/ML (95% CI; P=0.0086);  \u00b7  RAPIDITY: LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY DELIVERED NICOTINE INTO THE BLOOD STREAM BY THE FIRST TIME INTERVAL OF BLOOD SAMPLING AT THE 2-MINUTE MARK. ON AVERAGE, LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY DELIVERED 203 NG/ML TO THE BLOOD IN AGGREGATE OF THE 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 AND 15-MINUTE TIME POINTS, COMPARED TO ONLY 120 NG/ML IN AGGREGATE OVER THE SAME PERIOD BY THE CONTROL, AN IMPROVEMENT OF 70% (95% CI; P=0.0004).  IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE DESCRIBED SCIENTIFIC TESTING AND VALIDATION STUDIES, LEXARIA HAS ALSO CONDUCTED VARIOUS CANNABINOID FORMULATION EXPERIMENTS, TOGETHER WITH POTENTIAL DEHYDRATECH  TM  LICENSEE PARTNERS, ON CHOCOLATES, CANDIES, GUMMIES, MOUTH-MELTS, CHOCOLATE BARS, PROTEIN BARS, BEVERAGES SUCH AS BEER, SPICES, TEA, COFFEE, SUPPLEMENTS AND MORE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. BEVERAGE FORMULATIONS HAVE PRODUCED CANNABINOID WATER-BASED PRODUCTS INCLUDING DE-ALCOHOLIZED BEER THAT MASK UNWANTED CANNABIS FLAVOR AND ARE FAST ACTING. CHOCOLATE FORMULATIONS WERE REPORTED AS BEING THE FASTEST ACTING, MOST CONSISTENT, AND BEST-TASTING PRODUCTS RELATIVE TO COMPARATOR CONTROL FORMULATIONS IN APPROXIMATELY 70% OF CASES IN A RECENT 2017 CONSUMER STUDY. AS WELL, ON MARCH 22, 2016, LEXARIA ANNOUNCED RESULTS FROM ANOTHER CHOCOLATE FORMULATION CONSUMER STUDY IN WHICH TEST SUBJECTS RANKED THOSE CHOCOLATES THAT HAD BEEN CREATED WITH LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY AS THE BEST TASTING, MOST PALATABLE AND PROVIDING THE BEST OVERALL EXPERIENCE OF THE CHOCOLATES SAMPLED. FURTHERMORE, THE TEST SUBJECTS IN THAT STUDY INDICATED A TIME OF ONSET OF THE CANNABIS OIL EFFECTS IN AS LITTLE AS 15-20 MINUTES ON AVERAGE. THE STUDY INCLUDED 12 VOLUNTEERS WHO WERE ALL REGULAR CANNABIS CONSUMERS WITH EXPERIENCE INGESTING CONVENTIONAL EDIBLES. ALL CHOCOLATES USED IN THE STUDY WERE BLINDED (UNMARKED) IN ORDER THAT THE SUBJECTS COULD NOT DISCERN THE PRODUCT FORMULATIONS APPLIED.  TECHNOLOGY OUT-LICENSING  ON MAY 14, 2016, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH NUKA ENTERPRISES, LLC FOR A TWO-YEAR PERIOD, TO UTILIZE THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE, TEST, MANUFACTURE, AND SELL MARIJUANA-INFUSED CONSUMABLE AND/OR TOPICAL PRODUCTS, IN THE STATE OF COLORADO, WITH AN OPTION OF EXTENDING THE TERMS OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT TO WASHINGTON, OREGON, AND CALIFORNIA. ON APRIL 30, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A NEW 10-YEAR RENEWAL LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH NUKA ENTERPRISES LLC, MAKER OF 1906 BRAND CANNABIS CHOCOLATES AND OTHER EDIBLE PRODUCTS. THE NEW AGREEMENT PROVIDES NUKA ENTERPRISES LLC WITH SEMI-EXCLUSIVE ABILITY TO UTILIZE THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY ACROSS THE US. NUKA ALSO ACQUIRED AN OPTION TO EXPAND ITS PRODUCTS AND BRAND TO CANADA, INCLUDING USING LEXARIA\u2019S EXISTING CHOCOLATE AND CONFECTIONS CONTRACT MANUFACTURER LICENSEE CANNFECTIONS GROUP INC. THE AGREEMENT INCORPORATES NEW RIGHTS IN PRODUCT CATEGORIES IN ADDITION TO THE ORIGINAL CHOCOLATE FORMATS, WHICH INCLUDE CANDIES, BEVERAGES, CAPSULES AND PILLS, AND TOPICAL CREAMS.  ON JANUARY 25, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH A 7-YEAR TERM WITH CANNFECTIONS GROUP INC. WHEREBY LEXARIA IS PROVIDING ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY TO EMPOWER NEXT-GENERATION PERFORMANCE IN CANNABIS INFUSED CHOCOLATES AND CANDIES TO BE DEVELOPED AND SOLD IN CANADA AND INTERNATIONALLY.  29  ON FEBRUARY 26, 2018 THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT ENTERED AN AGREEMENT WITH NEUTRISCI INTERNATIONAL INC. (\u201cNEUTRISCI\u201d) (TSX-V: NU, OTCQB: NRXCF) SUCH THAT NEUTRISCI NOW OWNS 100% OF AMBARII TRADE CORPORATION AND LEXARIA HAS GRANTED TO NEUTRISCI AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSE AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT FOR THE MANUFACTURING AND SALE OF CBD BASED PRODUCTS.  ON FEBRUARY 27, 2018 THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH LOS ANGELES-BASED, PRIVATELY-HELD BIOLOG, INC. (\u201cBIOLOG\u201d) FOR A 5-YEAR TERM WHEREBY LEXARIA PROVIDED ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY TO EMPOWER A UNIQUE SET OF NEXT-GENERATION FOOD AND BEVERAGE CANNABIS INFUSION PRODUCTS TO BE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES.  ON APRIL 25, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH GP HOLDINGS LLC, (\u201cGP\u201d) WHEREBY LEXARIA PROVIDED ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY FOR CANNABIS INFUSED BEVERAGES AND TOPICAL SKIN PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA. GP ACQUIRED A 5-YEAR SEMI-EXCLUSIVE RIGHT. SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR END, ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2018, THE COMPANY CANCELLED THE CONTRACT DUE TO ONGOING DELAYS AND NON-PERFORMANCE.  ON JULY 31, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED, AND HILL STREET BEVERAGE COMPANY INC., (TSXV:BEER; \u201cHILL STREET\u201d) JOINTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO LICENSE LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  , ON A SEMI-EXCLUSIVE BASIS, FOR A TERM OF FIVE (5) YEARS, TO PRODUCE A LINE OF CANNABIS-INFUSED ALCOHOL-FREE BEVERAGES FOR CANADIAN DISTRIBUTION, FOLLOWING REGULATORY APPROVAL.  THE CONTINUATION OF OUR BUSINESS INTERESTS IN THESE SECTORS IS DEPENDENT UPON OBTAINING FURTHER FINANCING, A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS OF DEVELOPMENT, AND, ULTIMATELY, ACHIEVING A PROFITABLE LEVEL OF OPERATIONS. THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES BY US COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT DILUTION IN THE EQUITY INTERESTS OF OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS. OBTAINING COMMERCIAL LOANS, ASSUMING THOSE LOANS WOULD BE AVAILABLE, WILL INCREASE OUR LIABILITIES AND FUTURE CASH COMMITMENTS.  WE ARE NOT YET PROFITABLE AND HAVE NOT YET DEMONSTRATED OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES FROM OUR BUSINESS PLAN. WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CORPORATE FUNDS IF OUR EXISTING CAPITAL IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY UNTIL POTENTIAL FUTURE PROFITABILITY IS REACHED. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FURTHER FUNDS REQUIRED FOR OUR LONG-TERM OPERATIONS. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL OPERATING CAPITAL DURING OUR FISCAL 2019 YEAR, BUT DO EXPECT TO REQUIRE CAPITAL IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH OUR OWN, FEDERALLY LICENSED CANADIAN LABORATORY ON-PREMISES FOR OUR INTERNAL R&D PURPOSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US WHEN NEEDED OR, IF AVAILABLE, THAT IT CAN BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN THE ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS AS PLANNED, AND WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET OUR OTHER LONGER-TERM OBLIGATIONS AS THEY BECOME DUE. IN SUCH EVENT, WE COULD BE FORCED TO SCALE DOWN OR PERHAPS EVEN CEASE OUR OPERATIONS. THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER WE CAN OBTAIN ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FINANCING IF WE DO IN FACT REQUIRE IT.  OUR BUSINESS PLAN ANTICIPATES THAT WE WILL HIRE THREE TO SIX EMPLOYEES AND INCLUDES NEW OFFICE SPACE THAT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN ORDER TO FACILITATE A FEDERALLY LICENSED CANADIAN LABORATORY ON-PREMISES FOR OUR INTERNAL R&D PURPOSES. WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE CONTRACTED THIRD PARTIES FOR MOST OF OUR PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION NEEDS, INSTEAD FOCUSING OUR CAPITAL ON HIGHER VALUE ADDED ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS SUCH AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND SCIENTIFIC TESTING. WE HAVE NO CURRENT PLANS TO BUILD OUR OWN PRODUCTION FACILITY.  OUR COMPANY RELIES ON THE BUSINESS EXPERIENCE OF OUR EXISTING MANAGEMENT, ON THE TECHNICAL ABILITIES OF CONSULTING EXPERTS, AND ON THE TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL ABILITIES OF ITS OPERATING PARTNER COMPANIES TO EVALUATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.  30  COMPETITION  THE LEGAL MARIJUANA INDUSTRY IS COMPRISED OF SEVERAL SUB-SECTORS, AND IS LEGAL UNDER DIFFERENT GUIDELINES IN MANY STATES THOUGH IT REMAINS ILLEGAL UNDER MOST FEDERAL LAWS. NOTWITHSTANDING, THE OVERALL SECTOR IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED TO BE ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING IN THE USA, WITH STATE-LEGAL REVENUE OF OVER $8 BILLION IN 2016. INDEPENDENT PROJECTIONS AND PUBLICIZED REPORTS EXPECT REVENUE OF $20 BILLION OR MORE IN 2020, BOTH AS THE SECTOR GAINS IN CREDIBILITY AND ACCEPTANCE, AND AS MORE AND MORE STATES LEGALIZE EITHER MEDICAL USE OR ADULT RECREATIONAL USE; OR BOTH. IN ANY FAST GROWING INDUSTRY, COMPETITION IS EXPECTED TO BE BOTH STRONG AND ALSO DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE AS TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE COMPETITIVE THREATS. WHILE WE ARE AN EARLY ADOPTER WITHIN THE CANNABINOID DELIVERY SECTOR, THERE ARE ALREADY REPORTS OF MORE THAN 300 PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT HAVE CLAIMED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE SECTOR IN SOME FASHION; AND AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF PRIVATE COMPANIES. OUR CURRENT STRATEGIES MAY PROVE TO BE INEFFECTIVE AS THE SECTOR GROWS AND MATURES, AND IF SO, WE WILL HAVE TO ADAPT QUICKLY TO CHANGING SECTORAL CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY INTENDS TO AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE TECHNOLOGY OUT-LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES NOT ONLY WITHIN THE CANNABINOIDS SECTOR WHERE IT IS ALREADY ACTIVE, BUT ALSO ACROSS OTHER SECTORS WHERE ITS DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY IS PATENT ALLOWED AND/OR PENDING, INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE VITAMIN AND SUPPLEMENTS SECTOR, THE PAIN RELIEF SECTOR AND THE NICOTINE PRODUCTS SECTOR.  COMPETITION IN ALTERNATIVE HEALTH SECTORS AND IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS IN THE USA IS FIERCE. WE EXPECT TO ENCOUNTER COMPETITIVE THREATS FROM EXISTING PARTICIPANTS IN THE SECTOR AND NEW ENTRANTS. ALTHOUGH POVIVA TEA LLC HAS FILED PATENT APPLICATIONS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT PATENTS BEYOND THOSE ALREADY ISSUED WILL BE GRANTED NOR THAT OTHER FIRMS MAY NOT FILE SUPERIOR PATENTS PENDING. FOOD SUPPLEMENTS, ORGANIC FOODS, AND HEALTH FOOD MARKETS ARE ALL WELL ESTABLISHED AND OUR COMPANY WILL FACE MANY CHALLENGES TRYING TO ENTER THESE MARKETS. LEXARIA IS ALSO AWARE OF VARIOUS COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES THAT EXIST IN THE MARKETPLACE THAT CLAIM TO ALSO ENHANCE THE BIOABSORPTION OF CANNABINOIDS AS LEXARIA HAS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH REPEATED  IN VITRO  AND  IN VIVO  SCIENTIFIC TESTING WITH ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY. BY AND LARGE, THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALL FORMS OF NANOTECHNOLOGY THAT GENERALLY CLAIM TO ENABLE THE FORMATION OF MICROENCAPSULATED MICROEMULSIONS OF CANNABINOID ACTIVE INGREDIENTS. THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN ENABLE EXCEPTIONAL WATER SOLUBILITY OF CANNABINOID INGREDIENTS AND CAN IMPART IMPROVED INTESTINAL BIOABSORPTION AS A RESULT.  HOWEVER, IT IS LEXARIA\u2019S BELIEF THAT ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY OFFERS A HOST OF BENEFITS BEYOND WHAT COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES CAN OFFER, INCLUDING SUPERIOR ORAL PALATABILITY, A MORE APPEALING AND ALL-NATURAL INGREDIENT COMPOSITIONAL PROFILE FROM A FOOD AND BEVERAGE FORMULATION PERSPECTIVE AND SUPERIOR SCALABILITY AND COST EFFECTIVENESS FROM A MANUFACTURING PERSPECTIVE. LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT ITS DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY IS, THEREFORE, SIGNIFICANTLY DISTINGUISHED FROM COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES IN THESE RESPECTS, WITH A VIEW TO GROWING THE BREADTH AND NUMBER OF LICENSEES THAT WILL ADOPT ITS TECHNOLOGY FOR THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS GOING FORWARD. LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT THESE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES TOGETHER WITH ITS WEALTH OF SCIENTIFIC DATA SHOWING NOTEWORTHY BIOABSORPTION ENHANCEMENTS WITH ITS DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY CONSTITUTE A COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITION FOR ITS PROSPECTIVE LICENSEES, AND IT INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS NOT ONLY WITHIN THE CANNABINOIDS EDIBLES SECTOR WHERE IT IS ALREADY ACTIVE, BUT ALSO IN THE VARIOUS OTHER BIOACTIVE INGREDIENT SECTORS IDENTIFIED IN ITS ISSUED AND PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS.  COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION  OVER 30 STATES IN THE USA HAVE PASSED SOME FORM OF LEGISLATION RELATED TO THAT STATE\u2019S PERMISSION TO GROW, CULTIVATE, SELL OR USE MARIJUANA EITHER FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES OR FOR RECREATIONAL OR \u201cADULT USE\u201d PURPOSES; OR BOTH. THE VARIOUS STATE LEGISLATION IS NOT NECESSARILY HARMONIOUS WITH ONE ANOTHER, LEADING TO POTENTIAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN STATE LAWS. IT IS MOST OFTEN NOT LEGAL TO TRANSPORT CANNABIS-RELATED PRODUCTS ACROSS STATE LINES.  LEXARIA DOES NOT \u201cTOUCH THE PLANT\u201d IN ANY LOCATION WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF THE USA. WE COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW THAT PROVIDES FOR CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL (INDUSTRIAL) HEMP AND CERTAIN BYPRODUCTS TO BE MANUFACTURED AND SOLD IN THE US. THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY MAY HAVE APPLICATIONS WITHIN THE LEGAL MARIJUANA SECTOR AND WE MAY SEEK TO LICENSE THAT TECHNOLOGY TO COMPANIES THAT HAVE MET AND COMPLY WITH STATE REGULATIONS FOR THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION OF CANNABIS RELATED PRODUCTS IN ANY PARTICULAR JURISDICTION.  LEXARIA\u2019S POSITION IS THAT, JUST AS A TELEPHONE COMPANY PROVIDES COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, AND AN ELECTRIC COMPANY PROVIDES ELECTRICAL POWER, OUR PROVISION OF TECHNOLOGICAL SERVICES TO A STATE-LEGAL CANNABIS COMPANY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REQUIRED REGULATIONS.  31  LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY MAY ALSO HAVE APPLICATION IN COMPLETELY SEPARATE SECTORS SUCH AS VITAMINS, NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES, AND NICOTINE. WE HAVE NO PRODUCTS NOR OPERATIONS IN ANY OF THESE SECTORS TODAY, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE COMMENCED FORMULATION DEVELOPMENT FOR RESEARCH AND VALIDATION PURPOSES IN EACH OF THESE AREAS. IF WE ENTER ANY OF THESE SECTORS AT ANY TIME, WE WILL BE EXPOSED TO AND OF NECESSITY WILL HAVE TO COMPLY WITH, ALL LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN EACH OF THOSE SECTORS. AS A RESULT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF LEXARIA BEING INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF DISPARATE BUSINESS SECTORS, COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE FROM OUR COMPANY.  THE US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CONTEMPLATING THE 2018 FARM BILL THAT MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACTS ON INDUSTRY SEGMENTS THAT WE OPERATE AND HAVE PRODUCTS IN AND POTENTIALLY CHANGE SOME OF THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE RISKS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. THE BILL INCLUDES LIFTING RESTRICTIONS ON ADVERTISING, MARKETING, BANKING AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AS WELL AS ALLOWING INTERSTATE COMMERCE FOR HEMP AND HEMP-DERIVED CANNABIDIOL (CBD), REMOVE BARRIERS FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTIONS UNDER FEDERAL LAW SUCH AS PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS, AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER MEASURES THAT MAY POSITIVELY IMPACT THESE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS OVERALL. THE IMPACT THE BILL MAY HAVE ON OTHER REGULATORY BODIES AND THEIR REGULATIONS WILL REQUIRE ONGOING MONITORING TO DETERMINE THE OUTCOME AND TIMING OF ANY REVISIONS. SUBSEQUENT TO NOVEMBER 30  TH  2018, THE 2018 FARM BILL WAS PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW.  SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS  WE HAVE LEASED A NEW HEAD-OFFICE LOCATION IN KELOWNA, CANADA, THAT INCLUDES THE PURCHASE AND CONSTRUCTION OF OFFICE EQUIPMENT, FURNITURE, COMPUTERS, AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. WE ARE ALSO IN-PROGRESS OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FEDERAL LICENSED CANADIAN LABORATORY ON-PREMISES FOR OUR INTERNAL R&D PURPOSES, FOR WHICH A LICENSE APPLICATION HAS BEEN FILED WITH HEALTH CANADA. FINAL COSTS ARE NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME BUT COULD AMOUNT TO $400,000 - $600,000.  CONTRACTORS  WE PRIMARILY USE SUB-CONTRACTORS AND CONSULTANTS IN THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSING, AND ALTERNATIVE HEALTH PRODUCT SECTORS. WE ANTICIPATE THE ADDITION OF THREE EMPLOYEES DURING OUR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER AND ADDITIONAL RESEARCH PERSONNEL UPON LICENSE APPROVAL FROM HEALTH CANADA FOR THE RESEARCH LAB. WE PRIMARILY ENGAGE WITH CONSULTANTS TO SERVE OUR EXECUTIVE NEEDS.  THE COMPANY HAD AN AGREEMENT WITH CAB FOR A CONSULTING FEE OF $12,000 PER MONTH. THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT IS TWO YEARS BUT CAN BE TERMINATED BY EITHER PARTY BY PROVIDING TWO MONTHS NOTICE, WHICH CONTINUES ON A MONTH TO MONTH BASIS. THE COMPANY MAY PAY MR.

THESE AWARDS ARE LIMITED TO ONE PAYMENT PER FISCAL QUARTER.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MILESTONES (IP INCENTIVES \u201cB\u201d)  \u00b7  DURING THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT, FOR EACH PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION SUBSTANTIVELY DEVISED BY CAB AND SUCCESSFULLY CREATED, WRITTEN AND FILED WITH THE US PATENT OFFICE FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY, CAB WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN AWARD OF 250,000 RESTRICTED COMMON SHARES OF THE COMPANY.  32  ON JULY 1, 2018 THE COMPANY EXECUTED AN UPDATED THREE-YEAR CONSULTING CONTRACT WITH M&E SERVICES LTD. (M&E), A COMPANY WHOLLY OWNED BY MR. ALLAN SPISSINGER, WITH MONTHLY COMPENSATION OF CAD$12,000 INCLUDING AN 8% ANNUAL INCREASE SUPERSEDING THE PREVIOUS CAD$8,000 PER MONTH CONTRACT THAT INCLUDED 200,000 INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISABLE AT $0.37.

ON JUNE 19, 2017, THE COMPANY EXECUTED A CONTRACT WITH ALEX BLANCHARD CAPITAL AS MANAGER FOR INVESTOR RELATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS. THE AGREEMENT IS FOR SIX MONTHS CONTINUING MONTH TO MONTH AND MAY BE TERMINATED THEREAFTER WITH ONE MONTH\u2019S NOTICE FOR CAD$7,500 PER MONTH. MR. BLANCHARD WAS GRANTED 200,000 WARRANTS EXERCISABLE AT $0.29 AND 300,000 STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISABLE AT $0.295 VESTING 100,000 OPTIONS AT 1ST \u2013 3RD ANNIVERSARIES OF THE CONTRACT PROVIDED THAT THE CONTRACT IS NOT TERMINATED.

THESE MILESTONES ARE DURING THE FIRST 12 MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT WITH ALEX BLANCHARD CAPITAL.  \u00b7  REVENUE INCENTIVES \u201cA\u201d AS DEFINED ABOVE.  WE ARE PLANNING AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PERSONNEL OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTH PERIOD TO ENHANCE CAPACITY AND, SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE LAB FACILITY, FOR R&D PURPOSES. WE DO AND WILL CONTINUE TO OUTSOURCE CONTRACT EMPLOYMENT AS NEEDED. ADDITIONAL CAPACITY MAY BE REQUIRED WITH PRODUCT ADVANCEMENT OR RETAIL ACCEPTANCE OF OUR NEW PRODUCTS, WE MAY NEED TO RETAIN ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL PARTICULARLY IN THE FIELDS OF PRODUCT MANUFACTURING, DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ACCURATELY PROJECT POTENTIAL NEEDS INTO THE FUTURE BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT OCCUR.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  LEXARIA INCURRED $96,973 (2017 $110,392) IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES DURING THE PERIOD ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2018. SPECIFIC R&D PROGRAMS ARE IN ONGOING DEVELOPMENT AND WILL BE TIGHTLY RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL ABILITY TO UNDERTAKE EACH RESEARCH PHASE FOR EACH MOLECULE. DUE TO OUR EXPANDING PORTFOLIO COVERAGE, WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXAMINE ACCELERATED TIMETABLE OPTIONS FOR TESTING, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S PLANS TO INCLUDE  IN VITRO  ABSORPTION TESTS OF OUR PATENTED TECHNOLOGY OF MOLECULES SUCH AS: VITAMIN E, IBUPROFEN, AND NICOTINE ALLOWED US TO PERFORM TESTING ON NICOTINE WITH POSITIVE RESULTS. OUR PLAN TO CONDUCT OUR FIRST EVER  IN VIVO  ABSORPTION TESTS ON CBD ALSO YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS. ONGOING TESTING PLANS ARE PROCEEDING TO FURTHER DEFINE MOLECULAR COMPATIBILITY, ABSORPTION RATES, TIMING AND VIABLE FORMATS OF DELIVERY.  DEPENDING ON HOW MANY OF THESE TESTS ARE UNDERTAKEN, IT COULD REQUIRE BUDGETS OF AS MUCH AS $1,000,000, OR AS LITTLE AS $65,000, TO DO SO. IT IS IN OUR BEST INTERESTS TO REMAIN FLEXIBLE AT THIS EARLY STAGE OF OUR R&D EFFORTS IN ORDER TO CAPITALIZE ON POTENTIAL NOVEL FINDINGS FROM EARLY-STAGE TESTS AND THUS RE-DIRECT RESEARCH INTO SPECIFIC AVENUES THAT OFFER THE MOST REWARD.  33  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT ARE MATERIAL TO STOCKHOLDERS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED IN THE UNITED STATES. PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENT\u2019S APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. WE BELIEVE THAT UNDERSTANDING THE BASIS AND NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED WITH THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS CRITICAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIALS.  EQUIPMENT  EQUIPMENT IS STATED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER ITS USEFUL LIFE.  PATENTS  CAPITALIZED PATENT COSTS REPRESENT LEGAL COSTS INCURRED TO ESTABLISH PATENTS. WHEN PATENTS REACH A MATURE STAGE, ANY ASSOCIATED LEGAL COSTS ARE COMPRISED MOSTLY OF MAINTENANCE FEES AND ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. CAPITALIZED PATENT COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE PATENT.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  PRODUCT REVENUE  REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HEALTH PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS UPON SHIPMENT. THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS SALES NET OF THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL SALES RETURNS. SALES TAX COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS IS EXCLUDED FROM NET SALES.  LICENSING REVENUE FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR LICENSE FEES AT A POINT IN TIME FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OUR PATENTED LIPID NUTRIENT INFUSION TECHNOLOGY DEHYDRATECHTM FOR INFUSING ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS, TO THE LICENSEE, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS ON DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTATION.  USAGE FEES FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR USAGE FEES WHEN USAGE OF OUR DEHYDRATECHTM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OCCURS BY LICENSEES INFUSING AND ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT INTO ONE OR MORE OF THEIR PRODUCT LINES FOR SALE.  GOING CONCERN  WE HAVE SUFFERED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS. THE CONTINUATION OF OUR COMPANY AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR COMPANY ATTAINING AND MAINTAINING PROFITABLE OPERATIONS AND/OR RAISING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENT RELATING TO THE RECOVERY AND CLASSIFICATION OF RECORDED ASSET AMOUNTS OR THE AMOUNT AND CLASSIFICATION OF LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SHOULD OUR COMPANY DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS. THE RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS AND NET CAPITAL DEFICIENCY RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  34  RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  IN JANUARY 2016, FASB ISSUED AN ASU, SUBTOPIC 82510, TO AMEND CERTAIN ASPECTS OF RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT, PRESENTATION, AND DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. MOST PROMINENT AMONG THE AMENDMENTS IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, TO BE RECOGNIZED THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS RATHER THAN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE STANDARD SEPTEMBER 1, 2018. THE IMPACT WAS NOT MATERIAL AND THE $14,247 IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WAS INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  IN FEBRUARY 2016 FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 201602, LEASES (TOPIC 842) WHICH SUPERSEDES FASB ASC TOPIC 840, LEASES (TOPIC 840) AND PROVIDES PRINCIPLES FOR THE RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT, PRESENTATION, AND DISCLOSURE OF LEASES FOR BOTH LESSEES AND THE LESSORS. THE NEW STANDARD REQUIRES THE LESSEES TO APPLY A DUAL APPROACH, CLASSIFYING LEASES AS EITHER FINANCE OR OPERATING LEASES BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF WHETHER OR NOT THE LEASE IS EFFECTIVELY A FINANCED PURCHASE BY THE LESSEE. THE CLASSIFICATION WILL DETERMINE WHETHER LEASE EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD OR ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE, RESPECTIVELY. A LESSEE IS ALSO REQUIRED TO RECORD A RIGHT OF USE ASSET AND A LEASE LIABILITY FOR ALL LEASES WITH A TERM OF GREATER THAN TWELVE MONTHS REGARDLESS OF CLASSIFICATION. LEASES WITH A TERM OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR SIMILAR TO EXISTING GUIDANCE FOR OPERATING LEASES. THE STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED UPON ISSUANCE. WHEN ADOPTED, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THIS GUIDANCE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW STANDARD TO REPLACE THE INCURRED LOSS IMPAIRMENT METHODOLOGY IN CURRENT U.S. GAAP WITH A METHODOLOGY THAT REFLECTS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF A BROADER RANGE OF REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE INFORMATION TO INFORM CREDIT LOSS CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES. FOR TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, LOANS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO USE A FORWARD LOOKING EXPECTED LOSS MODEL RATHER THAN THE INCURRED LOSS MODEL FOR RECOGNIZING CREDIT LOSSES WHICH REFLECTS LOSSES THAT ARE PROBABLE. CREDIT LOSSES RELATING TO AVAILABLE FOR SALE DEBT SECURITIES WILL ALSO BE RECORDED THROUGH AN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RATHER THAN AS A REDUCTION IN THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITIES. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR LEXARIA BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1, 2020, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. APPLICATION OF THE AMENDMENTS IS THROUGH A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO DEFICIT AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE STANDARD ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 201802, INCOME STATEMENT\u2013REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220): RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH ALLOWS A RECLASSIFICATION FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO RETAINED EARNINGS FOR STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ENACTED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON DECEMBER 22, 2017 (THE \u201c2017 TAX ACT\u201d). CONSEQUENTLY, THE AMENDMENTS ELIMINATE THE STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE 2017 TAX ACT AND WILL IMPROVE THE USEFULNESS OF INFORMATION REPORTED TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT USERS. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL ENTITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED, INCLUDING ADOPTION IN ANY INTERIM PERIOD, (1) FOR PUBLIC BUSINESS ENTITIES FOR REPORTING PERIODS FOR WHICH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN ISSUED AND (2) FOR ALL OTHER ENTITIES FOR REPORTING PERIODS FOR WHICH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN MADE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE EFFECT THIS ASU WILL HAVE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES, BUT DOES NOT EXPECT IT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 201807, COMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING. THIS IS A SIMPLIFICATION THAT INVOLVES SEVERAL ASPECTS OF ACCOUNTING FOR NONEMPLOYEE SHARE BASED PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF TOPIC 718 TO INCLUDE SHARE BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS FOR ACQUIRING GOODS AND SERVICES FROM NONEMPLOYEES. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR LEXARIA FOR SEPTEMBER 1, 2019. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT IT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  35  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND 2017  THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017, WHICH ARE INCLUDED HEREIN.  OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND 2017 AND THE CHANGES BETWEEN THOSE PERIODS FOR THE RESPECTIVE ITEMS ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30  2018  $THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30  2017  $CHANGE  BETWEEN THE  PERIODS  $SALES  22,209  24,635  (2,426  )  COST OF GOODS SOLD  2,158  6,099  (3,941  )  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  721,442  593,703  127,739  IMPAIRMENT OF INVENTORY  -  3,546  (3,546  )  NET LOSS  (701,391  )  (578,713  )  (122,678  )  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPORT A NET LOSS OF $701,391 FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO 2017 WHERE WE INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $578,713. DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE HIGHER COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017, WHICH IS A RESULT OF THE INCREASES IN CONSULTING EXPENSES TO ADDRESS ADDITIONAL INDUSTRY SEGMENTS AND INCREASES FOR PATENT AND TRADEMARK FILING COSTS. THESE INCREASES ARE IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS FOR EXECUTING OUR BUSINESS PLAN.  REVENUE WERE PRIMARILY BASED ON LICENSING USAGE FEES IN LINE WITH CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS, WHILE CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES REMAIN LOW DUE TO CHALLENGES IN SECURING EXPANSIVE DISTRIBUTION OPPORTUNITIES, PRODUCTION CHALLENGES AND PAYMENT PROCESSING CHANGES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURSUE MORE WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION POSSIBILITIES WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO UNLOCK MORE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER REVENUES.  THE TREND OF HEMP OIL FORTIFIED FOODS, AND HEMP SEED PRODUCTS, GAINING CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE CONTINUED AND PROVIDES A REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SALES COULD INCREASE. THOSE TRENDS SHOULD SUPPORT HIGHER POTENTIAL CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES. IN ADDITION, LEGISLATIVE TRENDS IN AMERICA AND IN MANY NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD SUCH AS CANADA AND THE UK ARE SUPPORTIVE OF ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HEMP-BASED FOODS AND SUPPLEMENTS SECTOR. THOSE TRENDS COULD SUPPORT HIGHER POTENTIAL CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES. RELEASE OF THE TURBOCBD  TM  PRODUCT WAS SUCCESSFUL BUT SALES WERE LIMITED BY CHANGES TO PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL. AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT THE COMPANY HAD EXTINGUISHED ITS SUPPLIES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS LIKE PROTEIN BARS AND THE LACK OF INVENTORY WAS ALSO A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES POTENTIAL.  FOR 2019 THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO DERIVE THE MAJORITY OF ITS REVENUES FROM TECHNOLOGY LICENSING TO THIRD PARTIES NOTING THAT IP TERRITORY FEES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN NEW DEFINITIVE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OCCUR AND IP USAGE FEES ARE DEPENDENT UP ON LICENSEES OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENTS THE TECHNOLOGY BASED UPON REGULATORY APPROVAL. CANADIAN REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR INGESTIBLE PRODUCTS IS ANTICIPATED WITHIN 12 MONTHS OF THE OCTOBER 17, 2018 LEGALIZATION OF RECREATIONAL CANNABIS IN THAT COUNTRY. AT AUGUST 31, 2015 THE COMPANY HAD ZERO TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENTS ENTERED. BY AUGUST 31, 2016 WE HAD ENTERED SEVERAL LOI\u2019S OR DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY OUT-LICENSING. DURING THE PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SIX NEW LICENSING AGREEMENTS THAT INCREASED OUR IP LICENSING REVENUE AND WE EXPECT ADDITIONAL REVENUE WILL BE GENERATED FROM THE LICENSEES UTILIZING THE TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR PROCESSES FROM THE USAGE FEES AS THEIR PRODUCTION AND SALES OCCUR. IT IS THE COMPANY\u2019S VIEW THAT THE DECEMBER 9, 2017, GRANT OF PATENT US 9,839,612 B2, THE GRANTS OF US 9,972,680 B2 AND US 9,974,739 B2 DURING MAY 2018, THE SEPTEMBER 25, 2018 GRANT OF US 10,084,044 B2, THE OCTOBER 16, 2018 GRANT OF US 10,103,225 B2 AND ITS EXPANDING PATENT PORTFOLIO ARE POSITIVE STEPS IN ENABLING THE GENERATION OF MORE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES. AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED MORE THAN 10 FORMAL LETTERS OF INTENT OR DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS AND IS NEGOTIATING MORE.  36  WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT ALL OF THE LETTERS OF INTENT INTO WHICH WE ENTER WILL RESULT IN DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS WITH PAYING CUSTOMERS AND CANNOT PREDICT HOW MANY WILL. WE BELIEVE THAT STRENGTHENING AND EXPANDING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO AND CONDUCTING SUPPORTIVE R&D WILL JOINTLY CONTRIBUTE TO STRENGTHENING REVENUE PROSPECTS.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSISTENT BETWEEN THE COMPARISON PERIODS WITH SMALL DECREASES IN ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONS, AND TRAVEL, AND INCREASE TO ONGOING LEGAL FEES FOR PATENT AND TRADEMARK FILINGS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE COMPANY CONTINUED ITS INVESTMENT IN EXPANDING ITS PATENT AND TRADEMARK FILINGS AND BEGAN THE RENOVATIONS FOR THE NEW HEAD OFFICE LOCATION WITH IN-HOUSE HEALTH CANADA COMPLIANT RESEARCH LAB.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE COMPANY RAISED A TOTAL OF $1,649,190 FROM EQUITY ISSUANCES, RELATING TO THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT CLOSED IN OCTOBER 2018 AND THE ONGOING EXERCISES OF ITS OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS.  37", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Lexaria Bioscience Corp.", "CIK": 1348362, "Date": "2019-01-11T00:00:00", "Ticker": "LXRP", "Name": "Lexaria Corp", "Exchange": "OTC", "SIC": 1000.0, "Business": null, "Incorporated": "NV", "IRS": 202000871.0, "key": "20190111LXRP", "labelr1": -0.7874015748031503, "labelr2": 12.698412698412692, "labelr3": 4.2253521126760605, "labelr4": 7.4324324324324405, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5737533, "prof1": 0.42624670000000003, "return1&2": 0.8798900137482815, "return1&2&3": 0.8427115624631427, "return1&2&3&4": 0.7800775949827741, "return2": 0.873015873015873, "return1": 1.0078740157480317, "return3": 0.9577464788732394, "return4": 0.9256756756756755, "1_day_return": -0.7874015748031482, "cumulative_return1": 0.9304570292143568, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.9580598509210856, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.773939291355209, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.7825723503996724, "indexx": 19, "returnpred": 0.7874015748031503, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.026242720933164, "cumreturn1b": 0.96800962277859, "cumreturn1c": 0.9666066291369204, "cumreturndow": 1.0550352425512464, "cumreturnsp500": 1.053936667416719}, {"Unnamed: 0": 23, "level_0": 23, "index": 34672, "text": "ITEM 2.

(\u201cGSM\u201d) AND PLASTIC PALLET PRODUCTION, INC. (\u201cPPP\u201d). GREYSTONE ALSO CONSOLIDATES ITS VARIABLE INTEREST  ENTITY, GREYSTONE REAL ESTATE, L.L.C. (\u201cGRE\u201d). ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.  REFERENCES  TO FISCAL YEAR 2019 REFER TO THE SIX MONTHS AND THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018. REFERENCES TO FISCAL YEAR 2018 REFER TO  THE SIX MONTHS AND THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017.  SALES  GREYSTONE\u2019S  PRIMARY FOCUS IS TO PROVIDE QUALITY PLASTIC PALLETS TO ITS EXISTING CUSTOMERS WHILE CONTINUING ITS MARKETING EFFORTS TO BROADEN  ITS CUSTOMER BASE. GREYSTONE\u2019S EXISTING CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND ENGAGED IN THE BEVERAGE,  PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER INDUSTRIES. GREYSTONE HAS GENERATED, AND PLANS TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE, INTEREST IN ITS PALLETS BY ATTENDING  TRADE SHOWS SPONSORED BY INDUSTRY SEGMENTS THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM GREYSTONE\u2019S PRODUCTS. GREYSTONE HOPES TO GAIN WIDER PRODUCT  ACCEPTANCE BY MARKETING THE CONCEPT THAT THE WIDESPREAD USE OF PLASTIC PALLETS COULD GREATLY REDUCE THE DESTRUCTION OF TREES ON  A WORLDWIDE BASIS. GREYSTONE\u2019S MARKETING IS CONDUCTED THROUGH CONTRACT DISTRIBUTORS, ITS PRESIDENT AND OTHER EMPLOYEES.  15  PERSONNEL  GREYSTONE  HAD APPROXIMATELY 185 AND 167 FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  SIX  MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017  SALES  SALES  FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WERE $32,939,240 COMPARED TO $20,009,177 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR AN INCREASE OF $12,930,063. THE INCREASE  IN PALLET SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SALES GROWTH WITH A PALLET LEASING COMPANY, ONE OF GREYSTONE\u2019S  MAJOR CUSTOMERS.  GREYSTONE  HAS THREE MAJOR CUSTOMERS WHO ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 84% AND 73% OF SALES IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. PALLET  SALES TO GREYSTONE\u2019S MAJOR CUSTOMERS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 NEED WHICH MAY VARY BY PERIOD. GREYSTONE  IS NOT ABLE TO PREDICT THE FUTURE NEEDS OF THESE MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND WILL CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO GROW SALES THROUGH THE ADDITION  OF NEW CUSTOMERS DEVELOPED THROUGH GREYSTONE\u2019S MARKETING EFFORTS.  COST  OF SALES  COST  OF SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS $28,801,518, OR 87% OF SALES, COMPARED TO $16,976,241, OR 85% OF SALES, IN FISCAL  YEAR 2018. THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME THAT GREYSTONE HAS EXPERIENCED DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS HAS HAD A DIRECT  EFFECT ON PRODUCTION COSTS RESULTING IN THE INCREASE IN THE RATIO OF COST OF SALES TO SALES FROM FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO 2019. START-UP  COSTS TO ACCOMMODATE THE GROWTH WAS A FACTOR. FURTHER, CERTAIN PRODUCTS ARE MORE LABOR INTENSIVE WHICH AFFECTS THE RELATIONSHIP  OF COST OF SALES TO SALES.  IN  ADDITION, GREYSTONE\u2019S ABILITY TO PROCESS UNREFINED RECYCLED PLASTIC RESIN HAS BEEN LIMITED DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE NEED  FOR REFINED PLASTIC RESIN FOR PRODUCTION OF PALLETS HAS EXCEEDED GREYSTONE\u2019S CURRENT CAPACITY. MACHINERY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL  CAPACITY WAS ANTICIPATED ON BEING INSTALLED DURING THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, BUT HAS SINCE BEEN DELAYED TO FEBRUARY  2019. ADDITIONALLY, MACHINERY TO AUTOMATE CERTAIN PRODUCTION LINES WHICH WILL IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS FOR PRODUCTION LABOR  AS WELL AS REDUCE LABOR COSTS IS EXPECTED TO BE INSTALLED IN FEBRUARY 2019.  GENERAL,  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL,  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $1,792,741 IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $1,452,416 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR AN INCREASE  OF $340,325, OR APPROXIMATELY 23%. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER FISCAL YEAR 2018 RESULTS PRINCIPALLY FROM INCREASED COSTS  RELATED TO ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL.  OTHER  INCOME (EXPENSES)  OTHER  INCOME WAS $5,290 AND $12,069 IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE SOURCE OF OTHER INCOME IS THE SALE OF SCRAP MATERIAL.  16  INTEREST  EXPENSE WAS $848,318 AND $658,736 IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018 FOR AN INCREASE OF $189,582. THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE  IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER FISCAL YEAR 2018 IS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DEBT AND A 1.00% INCREASE IN THE PRIME RATE OF  INTEREST FROM NOVEMBER 30, 2017 TO NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  PROVISION  FOR INCOME TAXES  THE  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES WAS $440,100 AND $259,500 IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES DOES NOT INCLUDE THE INCOME FROM THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AS THE ENTITY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE INCOME TAX RETURNS OF  GREYSTONE AND THE TAXABLE INCOME OF THE ENTITY IS PASSED-THROUGH TO THE RESPECTIVE OWNERS.  BASED  UPON A REVIEW OF ITS INCOME TAX FILING POSITIONS, GREYSTONE BELIEVES THAT ITS POSITIONS WOULD BE SUSTAINED UPON AN AUDIT BY THE  INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT WOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE TO ITS FINANCIAL POSITION.  THEREFORE, NO RESERVES FOR UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS HAVE BEEN RECORDED.  NET  INCOME  GREYSTONE  RECORDED NET INCOME OF $1,061,853 IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $674,353 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 PRIMARILY FOR THE REASONS  DISCUSSED ABOVE.

THREE  MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017  SALES  SALES  FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WERE $14,733,130 COMPARED TO $9,722,102 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR AN INCREASE OF $5,011,028. THE INCREASE IN  PALLET SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALES GROWTH WITH THE PALLET LEASING COMPANY.  SALES  TO GREYSTONE\u2019S THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 85% AND 73% OF SALES IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  GREYSTONE IS NOT ABLE TO PREDICT THE FUTURE NEEDS OF THESE MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND WILL CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO GROW SALES THROUGH  THE ADDITION OF NEW CUSTOMERS DEVELOPED THROUGH GREYSTONE\u2019S MARKETING EFFORTS.  COST  OF SALES  COST  OF SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS $13,041,366, OR 89% OF SALES, COMPARED TO $8,588,065, OR 88% OF SALES, IN FISCAL  YEAR 2018. THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME THAT GREYSTONE HAS EXPERIENCED DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS HAS HAD A DIRECT  EFFECT ON PRODUCTION COSTS RESULTING IN THE INCREASE IN THE RATIO OF COST OF SALES TO SALES FROM FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO 2019. START-UP  COSTS TO ACCOMMODATE THE GROWTH WAS A FACTOR. FURTHER, CERTAIN PRODUCTS ARE MORE LABOR INTENSIVE WHICH AFFECTS THE RELATIONSHIP  OF COST OF SALES TO SALES.  17  IN  ADDITION, GREYSTONE\u2019S ABILITY TO PROCESS UNREFINED RECYCLED PLASTIC RESIN HAS BEEN LIMITED DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE NEED  FOR REFINED PLASTIC RESIN FOR PRODUCTION OF PALLETS HAS EXCEEDED GREYSTONE\u2019S CURRENT CAPACITY.

GENERAL,  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL,  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $853,650 IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $621,013 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR AN INCREASE  OF $232,637 OR 37%. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER FISCAL YEAR 2018 RESULTS PRINCIPALLY FROM INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO  ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL.  OTHER  INCOME (EXPENSES)  OTHER  INCOME WAS $3,021 AND $3,806 IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  INTEREST  EXPENSE WAS $435,690 IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $334,059 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR AN INCREASE OF $101,631. THE INCREASE IN  INTEREST EXPENSE IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER 2018 IS DUE PRINCIPALLY TO INCREASES IN THE PRIME RATE OF INTEREST, 5.25% AT NOVEMBER  30, 2018 COMPARED TO 4.25% AT NOVEMBER 30, 2017 AND INCREASES IN AMOUNT OF DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASES.  PROVISION  FOR INCOME TAXES  THE  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES WAS $108,500 AND $38,700 IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES DOES NOT INCLUDE THE INCOME FROM THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AS THE ENTITY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE INCOME TAX RETURNS OF  GREYSTONE AND THE TAXABLE INCOME FROM THIS ENTITY IS PASSED-THROUGH TO THE RESPECTIVE OWNERS.  BASED  UPON A REVIEW OF ITS INCOME TAX FILING POSITIONS, GREYSTONE BELIEVES THAT ITS POSITIONS WOULD BE SUSTAINED UPON AN AUDIT BY THE  INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT WOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE TO ITS FINANCIAL POSITION.  THEREFORE, NO RESERVES FOR UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS HAVE BEEN RECORDED.  NET  INCOME  GREYSTONE  RECORDED NET INCOME OF $296,945 IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF $144,071 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 PRIMARILY FOR  THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  18  NET  INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS  THE  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS $128,893, OR $0.00 PER SHARE, COMPARED A NET LOSS  TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF $(11,337), OR $(0.00) PER SHARE, IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 PRIMARILY FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  A  SUMMARY OF CASH FLOWS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 IS AS FOLLOWS.

TO PROVIDE FOR THE FUNDING TO MEET GREYSTONE\u2019S  OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018, GREYSTONE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE POSITIVE  OPERATING RESULTS OR EXPLORE VARIOUS OPTIONS INCLUDING ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM DEBT AND EQUITY FINANCING. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE  THAT GREYSTONE WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE POSITIVE OPERATING RESULTS OR BE ABLE TO RAISE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO MEET THESE OBLIGATIONS.  EFFECTIVE  AUGUST 10, 2018 AND DECEMBER 28, 2018, GREYSTONE AND IBC ENTERED INTO THE AMENDMENTS TO THE IBC LOAN AGREEMENT DATED JANUARY 31,  2014 WHICH PROVIDED FOR NEW FUNDING IN THE FORM OF AN ADVANCING LOAN IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,600,000 TO PURCHASE PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT  OF WHICH $3,357,465 HAD BEEN ADVANCED AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND INCREASING THE LINE OF CREDIT UNDER THE REVOLVING LOAN TO $4,000,000,  RESPECTIVELY. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019, PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $2.3 MILLION WAS ACQUIRED THROUGH A LEASING  ARRANGEMENT.  SUBSTANTIALLY  ALL OF THE FINANCING THAT GREYSTONE HAS RECEIVED THROUGH THE LAST FEW FISCAL YEARS RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM BANK NOTES WHICH ARE  GUARANTEED BY CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF GREYSTONE AND, FORMERLY, FROM LOANS PROVIDED CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF  GREYSTONE. GREYSTONE CONTINUES TO BE DEPENDENT UPON ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS TO PROVIDE AND/OR SECURE ADDITIONAL FINANCING AND  THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. AS SUCH, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT FUNDING WILL  BE AVAILABLE FOR GREYSTONE TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS.  19  GREYSTONE  HAS 50,000 OUTSTANDING SHARES OF CUMULATIVE 2003 PREFERRED STOCK WITH A LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF $5,000,000 AND A PREFERRED DIVIDEND  RATE OF THE PRIME RATE OF INTEREST PLUS 3.25%.

WE MANUFACTURE AND MARKET PRESTRESSED CONCRETE STRAND (\u201cPC STRAND\u201d) AND WELDED WIRE REINFORCEMENT, INCLUDING ESM, CONCRETE PIPE REINFORCEMENT AND STANDARD WELDED WIRE REINFORCEMENT. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRIMARILY TO MANUFACTURERS OF CONCRETE PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED IN NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHO ARE OUR EMPLOYEES.

THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES WAS DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED OVER THE COURSE OF THE PRIOR YEAR TO RECOVER THE ESCALATION IN RAW MATERIAL COSTS. SHIPMENTS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER WERE UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED BY ADVERSE WEATHER IN MANY REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECT DELAYS TOGETHER WITH AN INCREASE IN LOW-PRICED IMPORT COMPETITION.  GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DECREASED 5.9% TO $11.0 MILLION, OR 10.5% OF NET SALES, FROM $11.7 MILLION, OR 11.9% OF NET SALES, IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER DUE TO HIGHER MANUFACTURING COSTS ($2.4 MILLION) AND LOWER SHIPMENTS ($2.1 MILLION) PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SPREADS BETWEEN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS ($4.2 MILLION). THE INCREASE IN SPREADS WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES ($22.8 MILLION) PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS ($18.4 MILLION) AND FREIGHT EXPENSE ($207,000).  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE (\u201cSG&A EXPENSE\u201d) FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 INCREASED 13.4% TO $6.5 MILLION, OR 6.3% OF NET SALES, FROM $5.8 MILLION, OR 5.9% OF NET SALES IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RELATIVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGES IN THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES ($788,000) PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSE ($334,000). THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES DECREASED $532,000 IN THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF $256,000 IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER DUE TO THE CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS. THE DECREASE IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY LOWER INCENTIVE PLAN EXPENSE BASED ON OUR WEAKER RESULTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER.  OTHER INCOME  OTHER INCOME OF $829,000 FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A NET GAIN FROM THE DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ($709,000).  17  INCOME TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 INCREASED TO 23.5% FROM (36.8%) FOR THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE PRIOR YEAR RATE REFLECTS A $3.7 MILLION GAIN ON THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE LOWER CORPORATE TAX RATE ENACTED UNDER THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT IN DECEMBER 2017. EXCLUDING THE DEFERRED TAX GAIN, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 24.9% IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER REFLECTING THE REDUCTION IN THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE TO 21% FROM 35% FOR THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2018.  NET EARNINGS  NET EARNINGS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DECREASED TO $4.1 MILLION ($0.21 PER DILUTED SHARE) FROM $8.1 MILLION ($0.42 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT AND INCREASE IN SG&A EXPENSE TOGETHER WITH THE PRIOR YEAR INCOME TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO ENACTMENT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 29,  DECEMBER 30,  2018  2017  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED FOR) OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(22,768  )  $14,764  NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (5,663  )  (9,533  )  NET CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (7  )  -  NET WORKING CAPITAL  125,265  97,109  TOTAL DEBT  -  -  PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CAPITAL  -  -  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY  $245,382  $212,110  PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CAPITAL  100.0%  100.0%  TOTAL CAPITAL (TOTAL DEBT + SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY)  $245,382  $212,110  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OPERATING ACTIVITIES USED $22.8 MILLION OF CASH DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY FROM NET EARNINGS ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS TOGETHER WITH A NET DECREASE IN THE WORKING CAPITAL COMPONENTS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORIES, AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES. NET WORKING CAPITAL USED $31.2 MILLION OF CASH DUE TO A $25.1 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES AND A $21.1 MILLION INCREASE IN INVENTORIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $15.0 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES WAS LARGELY DUE TO LOWER RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES DURING THE LATTER PORTION OF THE QUARTER, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE PAYMENT OF ACCRUED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN INVENTORIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE REDUCTION IN SHIPMENTS AND HIGHER UNIT COSTS DURING THE QUARTER. THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE USUAL SEASONAL DOWNTURN IN SALES NEAR THE END OF THE QUARTER COMPOUNDED BY THE ADVERSE WEATHER.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED $14.8 MILLION OF CASH DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 PRIMARILY FROM NET EARNINGS ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS TOGETHER WITH A DECREASE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL. NET WORKING CAPITAL PROVIDED $4.6 MILLION OF CASH DUE TO A $10.9 MILLION DECREASE IN INVENTORIES AND A $0.5 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $6.8 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES. THE DECREASE IN INVENTORIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES DURING THE QUARTER. THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS LARGELY RELATED TO THE USUAL SEASONAL DOWNTURN IN SALES NEAR THE END OF THE QUARTER. THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO LOWER RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES DURING THE QUARTER TOGETHER WITH THE PAYMENT OF ACCRUED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR.  18  WE MAY ELECT TO ADJUST OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS THERE ARE CHANGES IN OUR CONSTRUCTION END-MARKETS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS. WHILE A DOWNTURN IN THE LEVEL OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY ADVERSELY AFFECTS SALES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IT GENERALLY REDUCES OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INVESTING ACTIVITIES USED $5.7 MILLION OF CASH DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO $9.5 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF A BUSINESS IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND A DECREASE IN THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES IN THE CURRENT QUARTER. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCREASED SLIGHTLY TO $6.2 MILLION FROM $6.1 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER AND ARE EXPECTED TO TOTAL UP TO $22.0 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2019 PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON COST AND PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES IN ADDITION TO RECURRING MAINTENANCE.  OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES ARE LARGELY DISCRETIONARY, PROVIDING US WITH THE ABILITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL OUTLAYS SHOULD BUSINESS CONDITIONS WARRANT THAT SUCH ACTIONS BE TAKEN.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FINANCING ACTIVITIES DID NOT PROVIDE OR USE ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CASH DURING THE CURRENT OR PRIOR YEAR QUARTERS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE DECLARED A REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $576,000, OR $0.03 PER SHARE, WHICH WAS PAID IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WE DECLARED A SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND TOTALING $19.0 MILLION, OR $1.00 PER SHARE, AND A REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $571,000, OR $0.03 PER SHARE, WHICH WERE PAID IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  CASH MANAGEMENT  OUR CASH IS PRINCIPALLY CONCENTRATED AT ONE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, WHICH AT TIMES EXCEEDS FEDERALLY INSURED LIMITS. WE INVEST EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES THAT BEAR MINIMAL RISK.  CREDIT FACILITY  WE HAVE A $100.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cCREDIT FACILITY\u201d) MATURING MAY 13, 2020 THAT IS USED TO SUPPLEMENT OUR OPERATING CASH FLOW AND FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE, GENERAL CORPORATE AND GROWTH REQUIREMENTS. ADVANCES UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY ARE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENT AMOUNT (CURRENTLY $100.0 MILLION) OR A BORROWING BASE AMOUNT THAT IS CALCULATED BASED UPON A PERCENTAGE OF ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018, NO BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING ON THE CREDIT FACILITY, $98.2 MILLION OF BORROWING CAPACITY WAS AVAILABLE AND OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT TOTALED $1.8 MILLION (SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).  WE BELIEVE THAT, IN THE ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT UNANTICIPATED CASH DEMANDS, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, NET CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND THE BORROWING AVAILABILITY PROVIDED UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR EXPECTED REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, IF ANY. WE EXPECT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AS REQUIRED. HOWEVER, SHOULD WE EXPERIENCE FUTURE REDUCTIONS IN OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS DUE TO WEAKENING CONDITIONS IN OUR CONSTRUCTION END-MARKETS AND REDUCED DEMAND FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MAY NEED TO CURTAIL CAPITAL AND OPERATING EXPENDITURES, DELAY OR RESTRICT SHARE REPURCHASES, CEASE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND/OR REALIGN OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  SHOULD WE DETERMINE, AT ANY TIME, THAT WE REQUIRED ADDITIONAL SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY, WE WOULD EVALUATE THE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING THAT WOULD BE POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH FUNDING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH FINANCING, IF PURSUED, WOULD BE OBTAINED, OR IF OBTAINED, WOULD BE ADEQUATE OR ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR STRONG BALANCE SHEET, FLEXIBLE CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND BORROWING CAPACITY AVAILABLE TO US UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY POSITION US TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, INCLUDING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  SEASONALITY AND CYCLICALITY  DEMAND IN OUR MARKETS IS BOTH SEASONAL AND CYCLICAL, DRIVEN BY THE LEVEL OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, BUT CAN ALSO BE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE INVENTORY POSITIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. FROM A SEASONAL STANDPOINT, SHIPMENTS TYPICALLY REACH THEIR HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE YEAR WHEN WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE THE MOST CONDUCIVE TO CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. AS A RESULT, ASSUMING NORMAL SEASONAL WEATHER PATTERNS, SHIPMENTS AND PROFITABILITY ARE USUALLY HIGHER IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND LOWER IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS. FROM A CYCLICAL STANDPOINT, CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY AND DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS GENERALLY CORRELATED WITH GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF NONRESIDENTIAL AND RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION FOR EXTENDED PERIODS.  19  IMPACT OF INFLATION  WE ARE SUBJECT TO INFLATIONARY RISKS ARISING FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET PRICES FOR OUR PRIMARY RAW MATERIAL, HOT-ROLLED CARBON STEEL WIRE ROD, AND, TO A MUCH LESSER EXTENT, FREIGHT, ENERGY AND OTHER CONSUMABLES THAT ARE USED IN OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. WE HAVE GENERALLY BEEN ABLE TO ADJUST OUR SELLING PRICES TO PASS THROUGH INCREASES IN THESE COSTS OR OFFSET THEM THROUGH VARIOUS COST REDUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES. HOWEVER, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE OUR SELLING PRICES DEPENDS ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS, AND THERE MAY BE PERIODS DURING WHICH WE ARE UNABLE TO FULLY RECOVER INCREASES IN OUR COSTS. INFLATION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR SALES OR EARNINGS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS, ARRANGEMENTS, OBLIGATIONS (INCLUDING CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS), OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR OTHER PERSONS, AS DESCRIBED BY ITEM 303(A)(4) OF REGULATION S-K OF THE SEC, THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL CURRENT OR FUTURE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CAPITAL RESOURCES OR SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF REVENUES OR EXPENSES.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS AS DISCLOSED IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT OTHER THAN THOSE WHICH OCCUR IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. FOR INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION. THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES THE APPLICATION OF THESE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN ADDITION TO CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BASED ON CURRENT AVAILABLE INFORMATION, ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES, HISTORICAL RESULTS AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. PLEASE REFER TO \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d INCLUDED IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018, THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN THE NATURE OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR THE APPLICATION OF THOSE POLICIES FROM THOSE REPORTED IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT OTHER THAN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2014-09 \u201cREVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\u201d.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  REFER TO NOTE 2 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT FOR RECENTLY ADOPTED AND ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS INCLUDING THE EXPECTED DATES OF ADOPTION AND ESTIMATED EFFECTS, IF ANY, ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OUTLOOK  LOOKING AHEAD TO THE REMAINDER OF 2019, WE EXPECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS WILL BE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR CONSTRUCTION END-MARKETS AND THE WEATHER-RELATED DEFERRAL OF BUSINESS FROM THE FIRST QUARTER. THE LEADING INDICATORS AND INDUSTRY FORECASTS FOR NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION REMAIN POSITIVE. THE INFRASTRUCTURE-RELATED PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS SHOULD BENEFIT FROM INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH THE FAST ACT AND SUPPLEMENTARY MEASURES TOGETHER WITH HIGHER STATE AND LOCAL SPENDING IN MANY OF OUR MARKETS SUPPORTED BY VARIOUS INITIATIVES SUCH AS FUEL TAX INCREASES, BOND ISSUANCES AND OTHER BALLOT MEASURES.  WE EXPECT BUSINESS CONDITIONS WILL REMAIN CHALLENGING, HOWEVER, IN VIEW OF THE ESCALATION IN OUR RAW MATERIAL COSTS RESULTING FROM THE SECTION 232 TARIFFS ON IMPORTED STEEL AND THE DUTIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED AGAINST CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT TRADE CASES INITIATED BY DOMESTIC WIRE ROD PRODUCERS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE OPERATIONAL FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR BUSINESS: CLOSELY MANAGING AND CONTROLLING OUR EXPENSES; ALIGNING OUR PRODUCTION SCHEDULES WITH DEMAND IN A PROACTIVE MANNER AS THERE ARE CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS TO MINIMIZE OUR CASH OPERATING COSTS; AND PURSUING FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ALL OF OUR MANUFACTURING, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO EXPECT GRADUALLY INCREASING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS WE HAVE MADE IN OUR FACILITIES IN THE FORM OF REDUCED OPERATING COSTS AND ADDITIONAL CAPACITY TO SUPPORT FUTURE GROWTH (SEE \u201cCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d). IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE FURTHER ACQUISITIONS IN OUR EXISTING BUSINESSES THAT EXPAND OUR PENETRATION OF MARKETS WE CURRENTLY SERVE OR EXPAND OUR FOOTPRINT.  20", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "INSTEEL INDUSTRIES INC", "CIK": 764401, "Date": "2019-01-17T00:00:00", "Ticker": "IIIN", "Name": "Insteel Industries Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 3310.0, "Business": "NC", "Incorporated": "NC", "IRS": 560674867.0, "key": "20190117IIIN", "labelr1": 0.4589261128958303, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": -3.3348560986751963, "labelr4": -3.9224952741020878, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5410699000000001, "prof1": 0.45893008, "return1&2": 0.9954107388710416, "return1&2&3": 1.0286062546031505, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0689532863290776, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 0.9954107388710416, "return3": 1.033348560986752, "return4": 1.0392249527410211, "1_day_return": 0.458926112895841, "cumulative_return1": 1.0610317551305772, "cumulative_return1&2": 1.1013621210009223, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.7014659287656149, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.7339002497465643, "indexx": 24, "returnpred": -0.4589261128958303, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9954107388710417, "cumreturn1b": 0.9937758744946158, "cumreturn1c": 0.9723795974131973, "cumreturndow": 1.0910253637784841, "cumreturnsp500": 1.089046515611693}, {"Unnamed: 0": 25, "level_0": 25, "index": 64028, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ATTACHED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, WHICH INCLUDED AUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO AS OF AND FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018, AS WELL AS  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  OVERVIEW  THE COMPANY MANUFACTURES AND DISTRIBUTES A WIDE RANGE OF DISPLAY DEVICES, ENCOMPASSING, AMONG OTHERS, INDUSTRIAL, MILITARY, MEDICAL, AND  SIMULATION DISPLAY SOLUTIONS. THE COMPANY IS COMPRISED OF ONE SEGMENT - THE MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION OF DISPLAYS AND DISPLAY COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY IS ORGANIZED INTO FIVE INTERRELATED OPERATIONS AGGREGATED INTO ONE REPORTABLE SEGMENT.  \u2022  SIMULATION AND TRAINING PRODUCTS  \u2013 OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF PROJECTION DISPLAY SYSTEMS FOR USE IN  TRAINING AND SIMULATION, MILITARY, MEDICAL, ENTERTAINMENT AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS.  \u2022  CYBER SECURE PRODUCTS \u2013  OFFERS ADVANCED TEMPEST TECHNOLOGY, AND (EMSEC) PRODUCTS. THIS BUSINESS ALSO  PROVIDES VARIOUS CONTRACT SERVICES INCLUDING THE DESIGN AND TESTING SOLUTIONS FOR DEFENSE AND NICHE COMMERCIAL USES WORLDWIDE.  \u2022  DATA DISPLAY  CRTS \u2013  OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF CRTS FOR USE IN DATA DISPLAY SCREENS, INCLUDING  COMPUTER TERMINAL MONITORS AND MEDICAL MONITORING EQUIPMENT.  \u2022  BROADCAST AND CONTROL CENTER PRODUCTS \u2013  OFFERS  HIGH-END  VISUAL DISPLAY PRODUCTS FOR USE IN VIDEO WALLS AND COMMAND AND CONTROL CENTERS.  \u2022  OTHER COMPUTER PRODUCTS \u2013  OFFERS A VARIETY OF KEYBOARD PRODUCTS.  DURING FISCAL 2019, MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY IS FOCUSING KEY RESOURCES ON STRATEGIC EFFORTS TO GROW ITS BUSINESS THROUGH INTERNAL SALES OF  THE COMPANY\u2019S MORE PROFITABLE PRODUCT LINES AND REDUCE EXPENSES IN ALL AREAS OF THE BUSINESS TO BRING ITS COST STRUCTURE IN LINE WITH THE CURRENT SIZE OF THE BUSINESS. CHALLENGES FACING THE COMPANY DURING THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE.  LIQUIDITY \u2013  THE ACCOMPANYING INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE PREPARED ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS,  WHICH CONTEMPLATES THE REALIZATION OF ASSETS AND THE SATISFACTION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. EVEN THOUGH THE COMPANY REPORTED A SMALL PROFIT FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND A SLIGHT INCREASE IN  WORKING CAPITAL FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD, THE COMPANY HAS SUSTAINED LOSSES FOR EACH OF THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS AND HAS SEEN OVERALL A DECLINE IN WORKING CAPITAL AND LIQUID ASSETS DURING THIS THREE YEAR PERIOD. ANNUAL LOSSES OVER THIS TIME ARE  DUE TO A COMBINATION OF DECREASING REVENUES ACROSS CERTAIN DIVISIONS WITHOUT A COMMENSURATE REDUCTION OF EXPENSES. THE COMPANY\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL AND LIQUID ASSET POSITION ARE PRESENTED BELOW (IN THOUSANDS) AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND  FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  NOVEMBER 30,  2018  FEBRUARY 28,  2018  WORKING CAPITAL  $3,680  $2,762  LIQUID ASSETS  $34  $261  MANAGEMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED A PLAN TO IMPROVE THE LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN FULFILLING A  PLAN TO INCREASE REVENUES AT ALL THE DIVISIONS, EACH STRUCTURED TO THE PARTICULAR DIVISION WHICH HAS RESULTED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE GROWTH IN REVENUES. THE COMPANY HAS REDUCED OTHER EXPENSES AT THE DIVISIONS, AS WELL AS AT THE CORPORATE LOCATION  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  VIDEO DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT FURTHER DECREASES CAN BE ACHIEVED. THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED THE MERGER OF THE TWO FLORIDA BUSINESSES INTO ONE FACILITY AND THE RELOCATION OF LEXEL IMAGING INTO A NEW  FACILITY. THESE CHANGES ARE PROJECTED TO REALIZE ANNUAL SAVINGS THROUGH REDUCED EXPENSES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO EXPLORE OPTIONS TO MONETIZE CERTAIN LONG-TERM ASSETS OF THE BUSINESS. IF ADDITIONAL AND MORE PERMANENT CAPITAL IS REQUIRED TO FUND THE  OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE CAPITAL ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY, IF AT ALL.  THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SUCCESS OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLANS TO IMPROVE REVENUES, THE  OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS, THE PROCUREMENT OF SUITABLE FINANCING, OR A COMBINATION OF THESE. THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE POTENTIAL SUCCESS OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLAN CREATE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY  TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  INVENTORY MANAGEMENT  \u2013 THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS UNITS UTILIZE DIFFERENT INVENTORY  COMPONENTS THAN THE DIVISIONS HAD IN THE PAST. THE COMPANY HAS A MONTHLY RESERVE AT EACH OF ITS DIVISIONS TO OFFSET ANY OBSOLESCENCE ALTHOUGH MOST PURCHASES ARE FOR CURRENT ORDERS, WHICH SHOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF OBSOLESCENCE IN THE FUTURE. THE  COMPANY STILL HAS CRT INVENTORY IN STOCK AND COMPONENT PARTS FOR LEGACY PRODUCTS, ALTHOUGH IT BELIEVES THE INVENTORY WILL BE SOLD IN THE FUTURE, WILL CONTINUE TO RESERVE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL OBSOLESCENCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ITS INVENTORY RESERVES AT  NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018 ARE ADEQUATE.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH, FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND 2017, THE PERCENTAGES THAT SELECTED ITEMS IN THE  INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS BEAR TO TOTAL SALES.

THE COMPANY\u2019S AYON CYBER SECURITY (ACS) DIVISION IS UP 103.8% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS LAST YEAR. ACS BUSINESS  HAS BEEN STEADILY GROWING OVER THE PAST YEAR AND THEIR BACKLOG WAS $1.3 MILLION AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2018, ACS WAS UP 378.9% WITH STEADY SHIPMENTS TO ITS TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS. THE DISPLAY  SYSTEMS DIVISION WAS UP BY 81.6% AND 61.1% FOR THE NINE MONTHS AND THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIODS LAST YEAR. THE DIVISION HAD STRONG SALES WITH THEIR TOP CUSTOMER, LOCKHEED MARTIN AND WITH A LARGE  GOVERNMENT CONTRACT THIS YEAR. THEY ARE WORKING ON OTHER PROJECTS WITH LOCKHEED MARTIN AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO WELL WITH THIS ACCOUNT. THE DATA DISPLAY DIVISION SHOWED A DECREASE OF 51.4% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 DUE TO  DECREASES THROUGHOUT THEIR CUSTOMER BASE, THE COMPLETION OF A LARGE LONG TERM ORDER WITH A FOREIGN CUSTOMER BY THE LEXEL DIVISION, AND THE SALE OF CERTAIN ASSETS OF THE LEXEL DIVISION. THE LEXEL DIVISION WILL EXPECT LESS REVENUES GOING FORWARD AS  CERTAIN ASSETS AND BUSINESS WERE SOLD IN JUNE, 2017 AND THE DIVISION IS ALSO UNCERTAIN OF ORDERS FROM ONE OF THEIR LARGE CUSTOMERS. THEY HAVE RECEIVED SOME LARGE ORDERS FROM FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WHICH SHOULD HELP WITH THEIR SALES FOR THE REMAINDER OF  THE FISCAL YEAR. THIS DIVISION DID HAVE A 129.8% INCREASE FOR THE COMPARABLE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AS BUSINESS DID INCREASE AS LEXEL\u2019S PRODUCTION BEGAN TO STABILIZE AFTER THE PLANT MOVE FROM LAST YEAR. AYON VISUAL  SOLUTION\u2019S (AVS) SALES DECREASED BY 78.2% AND 32.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS AND THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018. THIS DIVISION\u2019S SALES ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LARGE CONTRACTS. IT HAD NONE IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  2018 AND HAD COMPETED ONE IN THE FIRST QUARTER LAST YEAR. THE DIVISION DID RECEIVE A LARGE CONTRACT OF $1.3 MILLION WHICH WILL SHIP IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. THE DIVISION\u2019S PRIMARY SUPPLIER WAS SOLD TO A COMPETITOR OF THE COMPANY, SO THE  FUTURE OF THIS DIVISION IS UNCERTAIN. THE OTHER INCREASE IN SALES WAS FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S NEW KEYBOARD DIVISION, WHICH POSTED SALES OF $1.1 MILLION AND $0.4 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS AND THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018  RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY ACQUIRED THIS COMPANY IN OCTOBER OF 2017. THIS DIVISION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT THIS LEVEL OF SALES EACH QUARTER.  GROSS  MARGINS  CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGINS INCREASED BOTH AS A PERCENTAGE TO SALES (25.8% TO 10.7%) AND ACTUAL DOLLARS ($2,971 THOUSAND  TO $931 THOUSAND) FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017. GROSS MARGINS INCREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017, BOTH AS A PERCENTAGE TO SALES (26.3% TO (8.7)%) AND ACTUAL DOLLARS, ($1,096 THOUSAND TO $(144) THOUSAND).  THE TWO FLORIDA DIVISIONS PERFORMED WELL AS THE MOVE TO ONE FACILITY IS SHOWING RESULTS. BOTH DIVISIONS SHOWED LARGE INCREASES IN BOTH THEIR  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE TO SALES AND IN ACTUAL DOLLARS. AYON CYBER SECURITY (ACS) GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS 48.1% COMPARED TO 28.0% AND THE GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS WERE $2,068 THOUSAND COMPARED TO $591 THOUSAND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, ACS GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS 45.0% COMPARED TO 41.5% AND GROSS MARGIN  DOLLARS WERE $848 THOUSAND COMPARED TO $163 THOUSAND. VDC DISPLAY SYSTEMS (VDCDS) GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS 10.9% COMPARED 3.2% AND THE GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS WERE $485 THOUSAND COMPARED TO $78 THOUSAND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, VDCDS GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS 5.7% COMPARED TO 2.3%. GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS  WERE $74 THOUSAND COMPARED TO $19 THOUSAND. THE NEW KEYBOARD DIVISION, UNICOMP, HAD $467 THOUSAND OF GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS OR 43.7% TO SALES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND $155 THOUSAND OF GROSS MARGIN  DOLLARS OR 40.1% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  VIDEO DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  THE OTHER TWO DIVISIONS HAD AN EROSION OF MARGINS DUE TO POOR SALES AS DISCUSSED IN THE SALES  SECTION ABOVE. THE DATA DISPLAY DIVISION HAD A NEGATIVE $105 THOUSAND IN GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS AND THE AYON VISUAL SOLUTION (AVS) DIVISION HAD $57 THOUSAND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018. THE DATA DIVISION IS EXPECTED TO  DO BETTER IN THE NEXT QUARTER AS THE LEXEL FACILITY IS EXPECTED TO DO BETTER AS A RESULT OF THE FOREIGN ORDERS DISCUSSED IN THE SALES SECTION ABOVE. AVS DIVISION HAS BEEN ABSORBED IN THE VDCDS DIVISION AND HAS RECEIVED THE LARGE ORDER FOR A VIDEO  WALL FOR A MAJOR ELECTRICAL COMPANY. IT IS SCHEDULED TO BE INSTALLED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S NEXT FISCAL YEAR.  OPERATING EXPENSES  OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED BY 1.9% OR $61 THOUSAND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017. THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO LEGAL EXPENSES OF $133 THOUSAND ASSOCIATED WITH THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS WITH LEXEL IMAGING AND THE LEGAL EXPENSES FOR THE SALE OF CERTAIN ASSETS OF LEXEL IMAGING IN THE FIRST QUARTER LAST YEAR  OFFSET BY HIGHER ENGINEERING SALARIES AT AYON CYBER SECURITY AND ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES OF $382 THOUSAND AT UNICOMP, THE ACQUIRED KEYBOARD DIVISION. OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED BY 4.1% OR $46 THOUSAND FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE COSTS WHILE INCREASING REVENUES WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE CONSOLIDATION OF ITS TWO FLORIDA BUSINESSES TO ONE LOCATION,  THE MOVE OF LEXEL IMAGING TO A MUCH LOWER COST FACILITY AND FURTHER CONSOLIDATION OF OPERATIONS BY MERGING THE TWO TUCKER BUSINESS UNITS, ONE INTO LEXEL IMAGING AND THE OTHER INTO THE FLORIDA OPERATIONS IN THE UPCOMING QUARTER.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $18 THOUSAND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND $4 THOUSAND FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND $12 THOUSAND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2017 AND $4 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING  NOVEMBER 30, 2017. THE INTEREST EXPENSE IS RELATED TO THE BALANCE OWED ON A BUILDING THE COMPANY OWNS IN PENNSYLVANIA, THE LINE OF CREDIT AT THE COMPANY\u2019S BANK AND THE INTEREST ON THE MARGIN BALANCE IN THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT  ACCOUNT, WHICH IS A 3.75% RATE.  OTHER INCOME/ EXPENSE  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE COMPANY HAD $129 THOUSAND IN ROYALTY INCOME, $128 THOUSAND IN RENTAL INCOME,  $33 THOUSAND ON THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF EQUIPMENT AND $29 THOUSAND IN OTHER, AND $52 IN INVESTMENT GAINS INCLUDING DIVIDENDS.

FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017, THE COMPANY EARNED $294 THOUSAND ON THE SALE OF CERTAIN ASSETS TO A COMPETITOR,  $208 THOUSAND ON ROYALTIES, $126 THOUSAND IN RENTAL INCOME AND ANOTHER NET OF $29 THOUSAND ON OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017 THE COMPANY HAD OTHER INCOME OF $59 THOUSAND DOLLARS,  PRIMARILY $55 IN RENTAL INCOME.  INCOME TAXES  DUE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S OVERALL AND HISTORICAL NET LOSS POSITION, NO INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS REPORTED FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDING  NOVEMBER 30, 2018 NOR FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. DUE TO CONTINUED LOSSES REPORTED BY THE COMPANY, A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS ALLOCATED TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET CREATED BY THESE LOSSES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE  ACCOMPANYING INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE PREPARED ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS, WHICH CONTEMPLATES THE REALIZATION OF ASSETS AND THE SATISFACTION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. EVEN THOUGH THE COMPANY  REPORTED A SMALL PROFIT FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND A SLIGHT INCREASE IN WORKING  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  VIDEO DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  CAPITAL FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD, THE COMPANY HAS SUSTAINED LOSSES FOR EACH OF THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS AND HAS SEEN OVERALL A DECLINE IN WORKING CAPITAL AND LIQUID ASSETS DURING THIS THREE  YEAR PERIOD. ANNUAL LOSSES OVER THIS TIME ARE DUE TO A COMBINATION OF DECREASING REVENUES ACROSS CERTAIN DIVISIONS WITHOUT A COMMENSURATE REDUCTION OF EXPENSES. THE COMPANY\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL AND LIQUID ASSET POSITION ARE PRESENTED BELOW (IN  THOUSANDS) AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018.

IF ADDITIONAL AND MORE PERMANENT CAPITAL IS REQUIRED TO FUND THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN  THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE CAPITAL ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY, IF AT ALL.  THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE  AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SUCCESS OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLANS TO IMPROVE REVENUES, THE OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS, THE PROCUREMENT OF SUITABLE FINANCING, OR A COMBINATION OF THESE. THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE  POTENTIAL SUCCESS OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLAN CREATE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  CASH USED BY OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 WAS $0.9 MILLION.

ON JANUARY 20, 2014, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY APPROVED A  ONE-TIME  CONTINUATION OF THE STOCK REPURCHASE  PROGRAM, AND AUTHORIZED THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE UP TO 1,500,000 ADDITIONAL SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK ON THE OPEN MARKET, DEPENDING ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE SHARES. THERE IS NO MINIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES REQUIRED TO BE REPURCHASED  UNDER THE PROGRAM.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 8,858 SHARES AT AN AVERAGE COST OF $1.12  PER SHARE AND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2017, THE COMPANY DID NOT PURCHASE ANY SHARES OF THE VIDEO DISPLAY CORPORATION STOCK. UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AN ADDITIONAL 490,186 SHARES REMAIN AUTHORIZED TO BE  REPURCHASED BY THE COMPANY AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERIM CONDENSED  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THESE PRINCIPLES REQUIRE THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT AMOUNTS REPORTED AND DISCLOSED IN  THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES. THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT MAY INVOLVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND COMPLEXITY INCLUDE RESERVES ON INVENTORIES, REVENUE RECOGNITION, AND THE SUFFICIENCY OF  THE VALUATION RESERVE RELATED TO DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE COMPANY USES THE FOLLOWING METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING ITS ESTIMATES.  RESERVES ON  INVENTORIES  RESERVES ON INVENTORIES RESULT IN A CHARGE TO OPERATIONS WHEN THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE DECLINES BELOW COST.  MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT IN INVENTORIES FOR DECLINES IN VALUE AND ESTABLISHES RESERVES WHEN IT IS APPARENT THAT THE EXPECTED NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE INVENTORY FALLS BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS  INVENTORY LEVELS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. SUCH REVIEWS INCLUDE OBSERVATIONS OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TRENDS OF THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS, NEW PRODUCTS BEING MARKETED, AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES RELATIVE TO THE PRODUCT CAPABILITIES OF THE  COMPANY\u2019S EXISTING INVENTORIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ITS INVENTORY RESERVES AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018 ARE ADEQUATE.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  EFFECTIVE  MARCH 1, 2018 WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d)  NO. 2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS  WITH CUSTOMERS  AND THE ADDITIONAL RELATED ASUS (ASC \u201c606\u201d), WHICH  REPLACES EXISTING REVENUE GUIDANCE AND OUTLINES A SINGLE SET OF COMPREHENSIVE PRINCIPLES FOR RECOGNIZING REVENUE UNDER GAAP. THESE STANDARDS PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON RECOGNIZING REVENUE, INCLUDING A FIVE-STEP METHOD TO DETERMINE WHEN REVENUE RECOGNITION  IS APPROPRIATE. ASC 606 PROVIDES THAT REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES IS TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS AT AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE  GOODS OR SERVICES. WE GENERALLY SATISFY PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS UPON DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TIME IN WHICH THE CUSTOMER OBTAINS CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE. IN CERTAIN CASES, WE RECOGNIZE  REVENUE USING THE  PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION  METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. BASED ON THE NATURE OF PRODUCTS PROVIDED OR SERVICES PERFORMED, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS COSTS ARE  INCURRED (THE PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION COST TO COST METHOD). WE ELECTED THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD UPON ADOPTION WITH NO IMPACT TO THE OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS OR REVENUE REPORTED.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  VIDEO DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES  OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS  REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. DISCLOSURE IS REQUIRED WHEN THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ULTIMATE LOSS WILL EXCEED THE RECORDED PROVISION. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ARE OFTEN RESOLVED OVER LONG TIME PERIODS. ESTIMATING PROBABLE LOSSES REQUIRES  ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT OFTEN DEPEND ON JUDGMENTS ABOUT POTENTIAL ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES.  INCOME TAXES  DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED TO REFLECT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES IN FUTURE YEARS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND  LIABILITIES AND THEIR FINANCIAL REPORTING AMOUNTS BASED ON ENACTED TAX LAWS AND STATUTORY TAX RATES APPLICABLE TO THE PERIODS IN WHICH THE DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO AFFECT TAXABLE INCOME. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN NECESSARY TO  REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED. AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018 THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $5.8 MILLION FOR BOTH PERIODS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT AND  NON-CURRENT  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS UNDER THE PROVISIONS  OF ASC 740, WHICH CONTAINS A  TWO-STEP  APPROACH TO RECOGNIZING AND MEASURING UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. THE FIRST STEP IS TO EVALUATE THE TAX POSITION FOR RECOGNITION BY DETERMINING IF THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE  EVIDENCE INDICATES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON AUDIT, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, IF ANY. THE SECOND STEP IS TO MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT, WHICH IS MORE  THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS WHEN EVALUATING AND ESTIMATING THE COMPANY\u2019S TAX POSITIONS AND TAX BENEFITS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE PERIODIC ADJUSTMENTS. AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE  COMPANY DID NOT RECORD ANY LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN MAY, 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ASU  2014-09,  WHICH CREATED A SINGLE, COMPREHENSIVE REVENUE RECOGNITION  MODEL FOR RECOGNIZING REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017 AND MAY BE ADOPTED EITHER RETROSPECTIVELY OR ON A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE BASIS.  ASU  2014-09  DID NOT RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE JUDGEMENT OR TIMING ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU  2014-09  ON MARCH 1, 2018. SEE NOTE 1 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED  ASU  2016-02,  \u201cLEASES\u201d. ASU  2016-02  INCREASES TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY AMONG ORGANIZATIONS BY REQUIRING ENTITIES TO RECOGNIZE LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE  LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND DISCLOSE KEY INFORMATION ABOUT THE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THAT REPORTING PERIOD. EARLY  ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS GUIDANCE ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DURING THE SECOND  HALF OF FISCAL 2016, THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS WERE DISRUPTED WHEN THE COMPANY WAS FORCED TO MOVE FROM ITS FACILITIES IN  REDONDO BEACH, CALIFORNIA TO A SMALLER FACILITY IN STANTON, CALIFORNIA. OPERATIONS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2016 WERE  SPORADIC. DURING FISCAL 2017 AND FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY SUSPENDED ITS ENGINEERING, MANUFACTURING, SALES, AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES  TO FOCUS ON RENEGOTIATING NUMEROUS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS.  IN  FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY SUCCESSFULLY ELIMINATED APPROXIMATELY 68% OF ITS TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS.  SPECIFICALLY,  IN FISCAL 2018, OUR SECURED CREDITORS CONVERTED APPROXIMATELY $5.73 MILLION OF SECURED DEBT INTO APPROXIMATELY 4.1 MILLION SHARES  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK. THE CONVERTED DEBT REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 80% OF THE TOTAL SECURED DEBT OF THE COMPANY.  THE BALANCE OF THE SECURED DEBT (THE REMAINING APPROXIMATE 20%), IS TO BE PAID TO THE SECURED CREDITORS IN CASH IF THE COMPANY  RAISES AT LEAST $4.0 MILLION IN PROCEEDS THROUGH NEW EQUITY OFFERINGS. ADDITIONALLY, IN FISCAL 2018, APPROXIMATELY 12.77 MILLION  OF UNSECURED DEBT WAS CONVERTED INTO APPROXIMATELY 9.3 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK AND APPROXIMATELY $12.3  MILLION OF UNSECURED DEBT WAS FORGIVEN. IN TOTAL, DURING FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY THEREFORE ELIMINATED A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY  $30.23 MILLION OF DEBT.  AS  OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, ROBERT KOPPLE, THE COMPANY\u2019S FORMER VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, IS THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT UNSECURED  NOTE HOLDER THAT HAS NOT AGREED TO RESTRUCTURE HIS DEBT. MR. KOPPLE CLAIMS THAT HE AND HIS AFFILIATES ARE OWED APPROXIMATELY $5.35  MILLION ON TERMS SIGNIFICANTLY PREFERABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY-SITUATED UNSECURED CREDITORS. THE COMPANY DISPUTES MR. KOPPLE\u2019S  CLAIMS. SEE \u201cITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\u201d INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2018 FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE DISPUTE WITH MR. KOPPLE REGARDING THESE TRANSACTIONS. MR. KOPPLE HAS NOT ACCEPTED  THE COMPANY\u2019S NUMEROUS OFFERS TO RESTRUCTURE THIS DEBT.  ON  FEBRUARY 14, 2018, THE COMPANY EFFECTUATED A ONE-FOR-SEVEN REVERSE STOCK SPLIT.  THE  COMPANY IS PLANNING TO RESTART OPERATIONS WITH A NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM AND IS PRESENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING CANDIDATES  FOR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY HAS A CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT FOR $1.25 MILLION  OF ORDERS FOR THE AURAGEN  \u00ae  PRODUCT TO FILL DURING THE NEXT EIGHT MONTHS AND ANTICIPATES THAT IT MAY RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT  ADDITIONAL ORDERS ONCE THE COMPANY IS BACK IN OPERATION.  OUR  BUSINESS IS BASED ON THE EXPLOITATION OF OUR PATENTED MOBILE POWER SOLUTION KNOWN AS THE AURAGEN FOR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL  APPLICATIONS AND THE VIPER FOR MILITARY APPLICATIONS. OUR BUSINESS MODEL CONSISTS OF THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS; (I) SALES AND MARKETING,  (II) ENGINEERING, AND (III) CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SUPPORT.  (I)  OUR SALES AND MARKETING APPROACH IS COMPOSED OF DIRECT SALES IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE USE OF AGENTS, DISTRIBUTORS AND JOINT VENTURES  FOR SALES INTERNATIONALLY. IN NORTH AMERICA, OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS IN (A) TRANSPORT REFRIGERATION, AND (B) U.S. MILITARY APPLICATIONS.  (II)  THE SECOND COMPONENT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS FOCUSED ON THE ENGINEERING SUPPORT FOR THE SALES ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE  ENGINEERING SUPPORT CONSISTS OF THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW FEATURES FOR OUR AURAGEN  \u00ae  SOLUTION SUCH AS HIGHER POWER,  DIFFERENT VOLTAGES, THREE PHASE OPTIONS, SHORE POWER SYSTEMS, HIGHER CURRENT SOLUTIONS AS WELL AS INTERFACE KITS FOR DIFFERENT  PLATFORMS. AFTER SUSPENDING ENGINEERING, MANUFACTURING, SALES, AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES TO FOCUS ON RENEGOTIATING NUMEROUS FINANCIAL  OBLIGATIONS IN FISCAL 2017 AND 2018, WE EXPECT MODEST ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES BUDGETED AT APPROXIMATELY $750,000 DURING THE FISCAL  2019 YEAR.  (III)  THE THIRD COMPONENT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS CUSTOMER SERVICE. IN FISCAL 2019, WE EXPECT TO REHIRE SEVERAL PREVIOUSLY TRAINED  FIELD ENGINEERS TO SUPPORT OUR PRODUCT IN NORTH AMERICA. IN ADDITION, WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR CHINESE JOINT VENTURE PARTNER  TO TRAIN THEIR STAFF TO SUPPORT OUR PRODUCTS OVERSEAS.  13  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION  OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND DISCLOSURES ON THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ON AN ON-GOING  BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION. WE USE AUTHORITATIVE PRONOUNCEMENTS,  HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS AS THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  REVENUE  RECOGNITION  WE  ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE JUDGMENTS BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND FUTURE EXPECTATIONS, AS TO THE RELIABILITY OF SHIPMENTS MADE  TO OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE JUDGMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE PROPRIETY OF THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE BASED ON STAFF ACCOUNTING  BULLETIN (\u201cSAB\u201d) NO. 101, \u201cREVENUE RECOGNITION,\u201d AND RELATED GUIDANCE. BECAUSE SALES ARE CURRENTLY IN  LIMITED VOLUME AND MANY SALES ARE FOR EVALUATIVE PURPOSES, WE HAVE NOT BOOKED A GENERAL RESERVE FOR RETURNS. WE WILL CONSIDER  AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESERVE FOR PRODUCT RETURNS WHEN OUR SALES INCREASE TO COMMERCIAL LEVELS.  INVENTORY  VALUATION AND CLASSIFICATION  INVENTORIES  CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COMPONENTS AND COMPLETED UNITS FOR OUR AURAGEN  \u00ae  PRODUCT. INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE LOWER  OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET. PROVISION IS MADE FOR ESTIMATED AMOUNTS OF CURRENT INVENTORIES THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME  OBSOLETE DUE TO CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT ITSELF OR VEHICLE ENGINE TYPES THAT GO OUT OF PRODUCTION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT EXISTING  INVENTORIES CAN, AND WILL, BE SOLD IN THE FUTURE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO UPGRADE IT TO CURRENT MODELS AND THAT THE VALUATION  OF THE INVENTORIES ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE REALIZABLE VALUES OF THESE ASSETS. THE AURAGEN  \u00ae  PRODUCT BEING SOLD CURRENTLY  IS NOT TECHNOLOGICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN CURRENT USE. EXISTING FINISHED GOODS INVENTORIES CAN BE UPGRADED TO THE CURRENT  MODEL WITH ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF MATERIALS AND MANPOWER. WE MAKE THESE ASSESSMENTS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: I) EXISTING  ORDERS, II) AGE OF THE INVENTORY, III) HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND IV) OUR EXPECTATIONS AS TO FUTURE SALES. IF EXPECTED SALES VOLUMES  DO NOT MATERIALIZE, THERE WOULD BE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  VALUATION  OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  LONG-LIVED  ASSETS, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, AND PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS, COMPRISE A PORTION OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS.  LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THEIR CARRYING VALUES  AUGUST NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS IS MEASURED BY A COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET TO THE FUTURE  NET CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THOSE ASSETS. NET CASH FLOWS ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON EXPECTATIONS AS TO THE REALIZE-ABILITY  OF THE ASSET. FACTORS THAT COULD TRIGGER A REVIEW INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE MANNER OF AN ASSET\u2019S USE OR OUR OVERALL  STRATEGY.  SPECIFIC  ASSET CATEGORIES ARE TREATED AS FOLLOWS.  ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE: WE RECORD AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BASED ON OUR EXPECTATION OF COLLECT-ABILITY OF CURRENT AND PAST DUE ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE.  PROPERTY,  PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: WE DEPRECIATE OUR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT OVER VARIOUS USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM FIVE TO TEN YEARS. ADJUSTMENTS  ARE MADE AS WARRANTED WHEN MARKET CONDITIONS AND VALUES INDICATE THAT THE CURRENT VALUE OF AN ASSET IS LESS THAN ITS NET BOOK  VALUE.  WHEN  WE DETERMINE THAT AN ASSET IS IMPAIRED, WE MEASURE ANY SUCH IMPAIRMENT BY DISCOUNTING AN ASSET\u2019S REALIZABLE VALUE TO THE  PRESENT USING A DISCOUNT RATE APPROPRIATE TO THE PERCEIVED RISK IN REALIZING SUCH VALUE. WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT AN IMPAIRED ASSET  HAS NO FORESEEABLE REALIZABLE VALUE, WE WRITE SUCH ASSET DOWN TO ZERO.  14  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  NINE  MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017  NET  REVENUES WERE $39,274 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 (THE \u201cNINE MONTHS FY2019\u201d) COMPARED TO $0 FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017 (THE \u201cNINE MONTHS FY2018\u201d).

ALL THE EXPENSE IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD IS DUE TO THE COMPANY REDESIGNING THE ECU FOR THE AURAGEN SYSTEM.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE DECREASED $121,287 (11%) TO $790,985 IN THE THIRD QUARTER FY2019 FROM $822,616 IN THE THIRD  QUARTER FY2018.  NET  INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE THIRD QUARTER FY2019 DECREASED $507,051 (63%) TO $295,221 FROM $802,272 IN THE THIRD QUARTER FY2018 AS  A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR THAT ELIMINATED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF DEBT.  OUR  NET LOSS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER FY2019 DECREASED $530,343 TO $1,310,445 FROM $1,661,534 IN THE THIRD QUARTER FY2018.

THE WORKING CAPITAL  DEFICIT INCLUDES NOTES PAYABLE AND ACCRUED INTEREST TO RELATED PARTIES OF $9,284,183 AND $8,696,665 AS OF NOVEMBER 30 AND FEBRUARY  28, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  NET  CASH USED IN OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WAS $1,902,151, A DECREASE OF $162,189 FROM THE COMPARABLE  PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WAS  $1,175,000, RESULTING FROM NET PROCEEDS FROM SUBSCRIPTIONS RECEIVABLE OF $1,225,000 PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A PAYMENT OF $50,000 ON  A NOTE PAYABLE.  15  THERE  WERE NO ACQUISITIONS OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT DURING THE NINE MONTHS FY2019 OR THE NINE MONTHS FY2018.  ACCRUED  EXPENSES AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018 INCREASED $111,863 TO $3,323,498 FROM $3,211,635 AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2018. APPROXIMATELY $2,225,000  OF ACCRUED EXPENSES IS SALARIES ACCRUED BUT UNPAID TO CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES DUE TO A LACK OF RESOURCES, AND APPROXIMATELY  $500,000 IS ACCRUED BUT UNUSED VACATION EARNED BY EMPLOYEES.  THE  COMPANY HAD A DEFICIT OF $24,435,402 IN SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018, COMPARED TO $24,665,496 AS OF FEBRUARY  28, 2018.  SINCE  2002 SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN DERIVED FROM SALES OF THE AURAGEN  \u00ae  . THE CASH FLOW  GENERATED FROM OUR OPERATIONS TO DATE HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, AND WE CANNOT PREDICT WHEN OPERATING  CASH FLOW WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS.  IN  THE PAST, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY, WE HAVE RELIED UPON EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FINANCING, PRINCIPALLY EQUITY FINANCING AND  PRIVATE INDEBTEDNESS. WE HAVE NO BANK LINE OF CREDIT AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING TO FUND ONGOING OPERATIONS.  THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF EQUITY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH FINANCING COULD DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS,  AND SUCH DILUTION COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL. IF WE CANNOT RAISE NEEDED FUNDS, WE WOULD ALSO BE FORCED TO MAKE FURTHER SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS  IN OUR OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PLAN AND ULTIMATELY OUR  VIABILITY AS A COMPANY.  CAPITAL  TRANSACTIONS  DURING  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WE ISSUED 2,256,444 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, VALUED AT $2,280,964 TO HARRY KURTZMAN ON  BEHALF OF BETTERSEA LLC, A GREATER THAN 15% SHAREHOLDER AS PART OF THE RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT. WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL 5,108,291  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK VALUED AT $1,992,251 TO HARRY KURTZMAN ON BEHALF OF BETTERSEA LLC AS A SETTLEMENT FOR DISPUTES. DURING  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WE ISSUED 742,857 WARRANTS TO MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE WARRANTS HAVE A  TERM OF FIVE YEARS AND AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $1.40. THE COMPANY RECORDED AN EXPENSE OF $312,072 FOR THE ISSUANCE OF THESE WARRANTS.  DURING  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017, WE ISSUED 5,000,000 (714,286 POST SPLIT) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR $1,000,000 IN CONJUNCTION  WITH OUR CHINESE JOINT VENTURE, WE ISSUED 5,116,959(730,994 POST SPLIT) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK VALUED AT $665,204 AS PART OF A  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, AND WE ISSUED 2,500,000 (357,143 POST SPLIT) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK VALUED AT $325,000 IN CONNECTION WITH  A CONSULTING AGREEMENT.  INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES  CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COMPONENTS AND COMPLETED UNITS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S AURAGEN  \u00ae  PRODUCT.  EARLY  IN OUR AURAGEN  \u00ae  PROGRAM, WE DETERMINED IT WAS MOST COST-EFFECTIVE TO OUTSOURCE PRODUCTION OF COMPONENTS AND SUBASSEMBLIES  TO VOLUME-ORIENTED MANUFACTURERS, RATHER THAN PRODUCE THESE PARTS IN HOUSE. AS A RESULT OF THIS DECISION, AND BASED ON THEN ANTICIPATED  SALES, WE PURCHASED, PRIOR TO FISCAL 2001, A SUBSTANTIAL INVENTORY OF COMPONENTS AT VOLUME PRICES. SINCE SALES DID NOT MEET SUCH  EXPECTATIONS, WE HAVE BEEN SELLING PRODUCT FROM THIS INVENTORY FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  MOST  OF OUR INVENTORY CONSISTS OF A VARIETY OF (I) METALLIC, MECHANICAL COMPONENTS, AND (II) ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS INCLUDING METALLIC  CHASSIS TO HOLD THE ASSEMBLED ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF MECHANICAL COMPONENTS ARE NOT AGED AND MOST OF THE ELECTRICAL  COMPONENTS ARE ALSO NOT AGED. THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE AGED ARE RELATED TO THE PRIME MOVER/GENERATOR INTERFACE THAT MAY NOT BE  IN DEMAND ANY LONGER.  IN  THE PAST WE HAVE OFFERED AND SHIP THREE DIFFERENT BASIC MODELS OF SYSTEMS; (I) A 5 KW BASED SYSTEM, (II) AN 8.5 KW BASED SYSTEM  AND (III) A 16 KW BASED SYSTEMS (TWO 8.5 KW SYSTEMS CONFIGURED IN TANDEM BACK-TO-BACK). EACH OF THESE SYSTEMS CAN BE CONFIGURED  WITH DIFFERENT OPTIONS SUCH AS 110 VAC ONLY, 220 VAC ONLY, 24 VDC ONLY, 12 VDC ONLY AND AC/DC COMBINATIONS OF THE SAME OR DIFFERENT  VOLTAGES. IN ADDITION, THE SYSTEM CAN BE CONFIGURED WITH SINGLE PHASE, SPLIT PHASE OR THREE-PHASE OUTPUT.  16  A  NUMBER OF THE MECHANICAL COMPONENTS ARE COMMON TO ALL THREE OF THE ABOVE CONFIGURATIONS, WHILE OTHERS ARE VERY SPECIFIC. FOR EXAMPLE,  THE STATORS AND ROTORS FOR THE 5 KW SYSTEMS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE 8.5 KW SYSTEMS, BUT THE HOUSINGS ARE THE SAME. SIMILARLY, THE  ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS CONSIST OF SOME PARTS THAT ARE GEARED FOR A SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION WHILE OTHERS ARE GENERIC AND CAN BE USED  FOR ALL OF THE CONFIGURATIONS. THE ELECTRICAL CHASSIS ARE ALSO INTERCHANGEABLE BETWEEN THE 5 KW AND 8.5 KW CONFIGURATIONS. DUE  TO THE NATURE AND MIX OF THE PRODUCT BEING SOLD, FREQUENTLY, THE 5 KW ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS ARE UPGRADED TO 8.5 KW SYSTEMS BY REPLACING  SOME COMPONENTS.  FROM  THE ABOVE DESCRIPTION ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THE INVENTORY CONSISTS OF NUMEROUS COMPONENTS AND SUBASSEMBLIES BUT NOT FINISHED  SYSTEMS; THEREFORE, EACH SYSTEM THAT IS SOLD AND SHIPPED TO A CUSTOMER IS BUILT FROM SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE IN INVENTORY AND  OTHERS THAT NEED TO BE PURCHASED TO BE ABLE TO CONFIGURE THE REQUIRED SYSTEM.  8.5  KW SYSTEMS REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF PRODUCT PREVIOUSLY SHIPPED. THESE SYSTEMS ARE BUILT BY USING EXISTING INVENTORY SUBASSEMBLIES  AND PARTS, INCLUDING SOME THAT CAN BE USED FOR BOTH 5 KW AND 8.5 KW SYSTEMS, AND ADDITIONAL PARTS THAT ARE PURCHASED TO PROVIDE  THE REQUIRED CONFIGURATION. TYPICALLY, SUCH SYSTEMS ARE BUILT USING APPROXIMATELY 20 TO 25 PERCENT OF EXISTING INVENTORY AND APPROXIMATELY  75% OF ADDITIONAL PARTS THAT ARE PURCHASED.  HOWEVER,  MOST OF THE SYSTEMS SOLD TO THE KOREAN MILITARY CONSIST OF 5 KW SYSTEMS. THEY HAVE BEEN PURCHASING APPROXIMATELY 100 SYSTEMS PER  YEAR AND HAVE INDICATED TO US THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. TO DATE WE HAVE SHIPPED OVER 500 SUCH  SYSTEMS (IN THIS CASE 100% OF THE ROTORS AND STATORS ARE USED FROM EXISTING INVENTORY AND OVER 50% OF THE ELECTRICAL PARTS ARE  ALSO FROM INVENTORY).  IN  ADDITION TO THE ABOVE, WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED DEMAND FOR DIFFERENT AND UNIQUE CONFIGURATIONS THAT REQUIRE THE PURCHASE OF ADDITIONAL  PARTS.", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "AURA SYSTEMS INC", "CIK": 826253, "Date": "2019-01-22T00:00:00", "Ticker": "AUSI", "Name": "Aura Systems Inc", "Exchange": "OTC", "SIC": 3690.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 954106894.0, "key": "20190122AUSI", "labelr1": 1.1884550084889656, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": -6.040268456375826, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5419148, "prof1": 0.45808524, "return1&2": 0.9881154499151104, "return1&2&3": 0.9881154499151104, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0478002757489089, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 0.9881154499151104, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0604026845637582, "1_day_return": 1.1884550084889645, "cumulative_return1": 1.458509985564991, "cumulative_return1&2": 1.7468638899051137, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.8622706734832528, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1.1079860761522065, "indexx": 28, "returnpred": -1.1884550084889656, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.1091632313927242, "cumreturn1b": 1.1022596602345784, "cumreturn1c": 0.9682870102893805, "cumreturndow": 1.0779487911387033, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0832839661896683}, {"Unnamed: 0": 29, "level_0": 29, "index": 207, "text": "ITEM 2.

UNDERLYING SALES  DECREASED 2%  AS UNFAVORABLE VOLUMES OF  3%  WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  HIGHER PRICING OF 1%  . THE DECREASE IN VOLUMES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER SALE OF EQUIPMENT ACTIVITY ON THE JAZAN PROJECT AND A PRIOR YEAR EQUIPMENT SALE RESULTING FROM A CONTRACT TERMINATION IN THE INDUSTRIAL GASES \u2013 ASIA SEGMENT. EXCLUDING THESE ITEMS, VOLUMES INCREASED 5% DUE TO BASE BUSINESS GROWTH ACROSS THE REGIONAL INDUSTRIAL GASES SEGMENTS AND THE FULL ONSTREAM OF THE LU\u2019AN PROJECT IN ASIA. PRICING ALSO IMPROVED ACROSS THE REGIONAL SEGMENTS, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR MERCHANT BUSINESS. HIGHER ENERGY AND NATURAL GAS COST PASS-THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS  INCREASED SALES BY 5%  , UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACTS, PRIMARILY FROM THE CHINESE RENMINBI, EURO, INDIAN RUPEE, AND CHILEAN PESO,  DECREASED SALES BY 2%  , AND THE MODIFICATION OF AN EXISTING HYDROGEN SUPPLY CONTRACT TO A TOLLING ARRANGEMENT IN INDIA, REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE AS \"OTHER,\"  DECREASED SALES BY 1%.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OPERATING INCOME AND MARGIN  OPERATING INCOME OF  $455.0  DECREASED  1%  , OR  $5.7  , AS A CHARGE FOR A FACILITY CLOSURE OF  $29  , HIGHER NET OPERATING COSTS OF $15, AND UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACTS OF $11 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER VOLUMES OF $35 AND FAVORABLE PRICING, NET OF ENERGY, FUEL, AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS, OF $14. THE INCREASE IN NET OPERATING COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER COSTS IN THE INDUSTRIAL GASES \u2013 AMERICAS SEGMENT, INCLUDING PLANNED MAINTENANCE AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS. OPERATING MARGIN OF  20.5%  DECREASED  30  BP AS THE IMPACTS OF THE FACILITY CLOSURE, HIGHER NET OPERATING COSTS, AND HIGHER ENERGY AND NATURAL GAS COST PASS-THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER VOLUMES AND FAVORABLE PRICING.

ADJUSTED EBITDA PROVIDES A USEFUL METRIC FOR MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  ADJUSTED EBITDA OF  $794.9  INCREASED  8%  , OR  $60.0  , PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VOLUMES, POSITIVE PRICING, AND HIGHER INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AND UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACTS. ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN OF  35.7%  INCREASED  250  BP, PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE VOLUMES, HIGHER INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES, AND POSITIVE PRICING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ENERGY AND NATURAL GAS COST PASS-THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS AND HIGHER OPERATING COSTS.  EQUITY AFFILIATES' INCOME  EQUITY AFFILIATES' INCOME OF  $52.9  INCREASED  $39.1  , PRIMARILY DUE TO A PRIOR YEAR EXPENSE OF  $32.5  RESULTING FROM THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT. REFER TO NOTE  14  , INCOME TAXES, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. ON A NON-GAAP BASIS, EQUITY AFFILIATES' INCOME OF  $52.9  INCREASED  $6.6  , OR  14%  , PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INDUSTRIAL GASES \u2013 AMERICAS AFFILIATES.  COST OF SALES AND GROSS MARGIN  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING THE FACILITY CLOSURE DISCUSSED BELOW, OF $1,573.0 WAS FLAT VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR AS LOWER COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALES VOLUMES OF $92 AND FAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACTS OF $39 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ENERGY AND NATURAL GAS COST PASS-THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS OF $97, THE FACILITY CLOSURE OF $29, AND HIGHER OTHER COSTS OF $5. GROSS MARGIN OF 29.3% INCREASED 20 BP, PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE VOLUME MIX AND POSITIVE PRICING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE FACILITY CLOSURE AND HIGHER OTHER COSTS. EXCLUDING THE FACILITY CLOSURE, COST OF SALES OF  $1,544.0  DECREASED  2%  , OR  $27.8  , AND GROSS MARGIN OF  30.6%  INCREASED  150  BP, PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE VOLUME MIX AND POSITIVE PRICING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OTHER COSTS.  FACILITY CLOSURE  IN DECEMBER 2018, ONE OF OUR CUSTOMERS WAS SUBJECT TO A GOVERNMENT ENFORCED SHUTDOWN DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS. AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED A CHARGE OF  $29.0  (  $22.1  AFTER-TAX, OR  $.10  PER SHARE), PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE WRITE-OFF OF ONSITE ASSETS, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019. THIS CHARGE IS REFLECTED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS AS \u201c  FACILITY CLOSURE  \u201d AND HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT RESULTS. ANNUAL SALES AND OPERATING INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CUSTOMER PRIOR TO THE FACILITY CLOSURE WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE INDUSTRIAL GASES \u2013 ASIA SEGMENT. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL CHARGES RELATED TO THIS SHUTDOWN.  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE OF  $189.6  DECREASED  1%  , OR  $2.0  .

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  ITEMS RECORDED TO \"OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\" ARISE FROM TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR PRINCIPAL INCOME EARNING ACTIVITIES. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET OF  $8.6  DECREASED  61%  , OR  $13.5  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INCOME FROM TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENTS AND AN UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE IMPACT.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST EXPENSE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  31 DECEMBER  2018  2017  INTEREST INCURRED  $40.0  $32.6  LESS: CAPITALIZED INTEREST  2.7  2.8  INTEREST EXPENSE  $37.3  $29.8  INTEREST INCURRED  INCREASED  23%  , OR  $7.4  , PRIMARILY DUE TO PROJECT FINANCING ASSOCIATED WITH THE LU'AN JOINT VENTURE.  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET OF  $18.5  INCREASED  89%  , OR  $8.7  , PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST INCOME ON CASH AND CASH ITEMS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND NON-SERVICE PENSION BENEFITS.  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE EQUALS THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DIVIDED BY INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE TAXES. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  27.0%  AND  64.2%  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL YEARS  2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. IN DECEMBER 2017, THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\"THE TAX ACT\") WAS ENACTED, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED EXISTING U.S. TAX LAWS, INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN THE FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, A DEEMED REPATRIATION TAX ON UNREMITTED FOREIGN EARNINGS, AS WELL AS OTHER CHANGES. THE CHANGE IN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE DISCRETE TAX IMPACTS RELATED TO THE TAX ACT. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, WE RECORDED A DISCRETE NET TAX EXPENSE OF $40.6 TO FINALIZE OUR ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACTS OF THE TAX ACT. THE NET EXPENSE INCLUDES THE REVERSAL OF THE $56.2 BENEFIT RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 RELATED TO THE U.S. TAXATION OF DEEMED FOREIGN DIVIDENDS. WE RECORDED THIS REVERSAL BASED ON OUR INTENT TO FOLLOW PROPOSED REGULATIONS THAT WERE ISSUED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. ADDITIONALLY, WE RECORDED A BENEFIT OF $15.6 TO FINALIZE OUR ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACTS OF THE TAX ACT AND REDUCE THE TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS OF THE DEEMED REPATRIATION TAX. OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 REFLECTS A DISCRETE NET INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $206.5 FOR OUR INITIAL PROVISIONAL ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACTS OF THE TAX ACT.  ON A NON-GAAP BASIS, THE ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  INCREASED  FROM  17.5%  IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  TO  19.0%  IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ON SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER BENEFITS FROM FOREIGN TAX LAW CHANGES ENACTED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER. OTHER THAN THE DISCRETE NET TAX IMPACTS DISCUSSED ABOVE, OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE TAX ACT DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OUR NON-GAAP EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  (MILLIONS OF DOLLARS UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, EXCEPT FOR PER SHARE DATA)  THE COMPANY HAS PRESENTED CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES ON A NON-GAAP (\u201cADJUSTED\u201d) BASIS AND HAS PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT MEANT TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES PROVIDE INVESTORS, POTENTIAL INVESTORS, SECURITIES ANALYSTS, AND OTHERS WITH USEFUL INFORMATION TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS BECAUSE SUCH MEASURES, WHEN VIEWED TOGETHER WITH OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, PROVIDE A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS AND TRENDS AFFECTING OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTED FUTURE RESULTS.  IN MANY CASES, OUR NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE DETERMINED BY ADJUSTING THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN DISCLOSED ITEMS (\u201cNON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS\u201d) THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN FISCAL YEARS 2017 AND 2016, WE RESTRUCTURED THE COMPANY TO FOCUS ON ITS CORE INDUSTRIAL GASES BUSINESS. THIS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT COST REDUCTION AND ASSET ACTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE WERE IMPORTANT FOR READERS TO UNDERSTAND SEPARATELY FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE RECORDED DISCRETE IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TAX ACT SINCE ITS ENACTMENT IN DECEMBER 2017. THE READER SHOULD BE AWARE THAT WE MAY INCUR SIMILAR EXPENSES IN THE FUTURE. READERS SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER THE LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL LACK OF COMPARABILITY OF THESE MEASURES FROM ONE COMPANY TO ANOTHER.  THE TAX IMPACT ON OUR PRE-TAX NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS REFLECTS THE EXPECTED CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSE IMPACT OF THE TRANSACTIONS AND IS IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY THE STATUTORY TAX RATE OF THE VARIOUS RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS AND THE TAXABILITY OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RECONCILIATIONS OF REPORTED GAAP RESULTS TO OUR NON-GAAP MEASURES FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF FISCAL YEARS  2019  AND  2018  ARE PRESENTED BELOW.

AS OF 30 SEPTEMBER 2018, THIS LIABILITY WAS  2.2 BILLION  RMB (APPROXIMATELY  $330  ).  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES THAT HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES OF UNCERTAINTIES ARE REQUIRED IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN MANY AREAS. HOWEVER, APPLICATION OF POLICIES THAT MANAGEMENT HAS IDENTIFIED AS CRITICAL PLACES SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT, OFTEN AS THE RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. IF ACTUAL RESULTS WERE TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES, THE REPORTED RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. A DESCRIPTION OF OUR MAJOR ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE IDENTIFIED AS CRITICAL, IS INCLUDED IN OUR  2018  FORM 10-K.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES TO OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR ESTIMATES DURING THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR  2019  THAT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGE IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

(\u201cLUBY\u2019S\u201d, THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d, \"WE\", \"US\", OR \"OUR\") IS A MULTI-BRANDED COMPANY OPERATING IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AND IN THE CONTRACT FOOD SERVICES INDUSTRY. OUR PRIMARY BRANDS INCLUDE LUBY\u2019S CAFETERIA, FUDDRUCKERS - WORLD\u2019S GREATEST HAMBURGERS  \u00ae  , LUBY\u2019S CULINARY CONTRACT SERVICES AND CHEESEBURGER IN PARADISE.  OUR COMPANY\u2019S VISION IS THAT OUR GUESTS, EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS STAY LOYAL TO OUR RESTAURANT BRANDS AND VALUE THEM AS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THEIR LIVES. WE WANT OUR COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE TO MAKE IT A LEADER IN OUR INDUSTRY.  WE ARE HEADQUARTERED IN HOUSTON, TEXAS. OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IS LOCATED AT 13111 NORTHWEST FREEWAY, SUITE 600, HOUSTON, TEXAS 77040, AND OUR TELEPHONE NUMBER AT THAT ADDRESS IS (713) 329-6800. OUR WEBSITE IS WWW.LUBYSINC.COM. THE INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE IS NOT, AND SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE, A PART OF THIS FORM 10-Q OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO ANY OF OUR OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SEC.  AS OF  DECEMBER 19, 2018  , WE OWNED AND OPERATED  140  RESTAURANTS, OF WHICH  82  ARE TRADITIONAL CAFETERIAS,  57  ARE GOURMET HAMBURGER RESTAURANTS, AND ONE IS A CASUAL DINING RESTAURANT AND BAR. THESE ESTABLISHMENTS ARE LOCATED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO RETAIL CENTERS, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS MOSTLY THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. INCLUDED IN THE  140  RESTAURANTS THAT WE OWN AND OPERATE ARE 12 RESTAURANTS LOCATED AT SIX PROPERTY LOCATIONS WHERE WE OPERATE A SIDE-BY-SIDE LUBY\u2019S CAFETERIA AND FUDDRUCKERS ON THE SAME PROPERTY. WE REFER TO THESE LOCATIONS AS \u201cCOMBO LOCATIONS.\u201d  AS OF  DECEMBER 19, 2018  , WE OPERATED  30  CULINARY CONTRACT SERVICES LOCATIONS. WE OPERATED 22 OF THESE LOCATIONS IN THE HOUSTON, TEXAS AREA, THREE IN THE TEXAS LOWER RIO GRANDE VALLEY, TWO IN DALLAS, TEXAS, AND TWO IN SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS. OUTSIDE OF TEXAS WE OPERATED ONE LOCATION IN NORTH CAROLINA. LUBY\u2019S CULINARY CONTRACT SERVICES CURRENTLY PROVIDES FOOD SERVICE MANAGEMENT TO HOSPITALS, CORPORATE DINING FACILITIES, SPORTS STADIUMS, AND A SENIOR CARE FACILITY.  AS OF  DECEMBER 19, 2018  , WE HAD  41  FRANCHISEES OPERATING  103  FUDDRUCKERS RESTAURANTS. OUR LARGEST  FIVE  FRANCHISE OWNERS OWN FIVE TO TWELVE RESTAURANTS EACH.  FIFTEEN  FRANCHISE OWNERS EACH OWN TWO TO FOUR RESTAURANTS. THE  21  REMAINING FRANCHISE OWNERS EACH OWN ONE RESTAURANT.  ACCOUNTING PERIODS  THE COMPANY\u2019S FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON THE LAST WEDNESDAY IN AUGUST. ACCORDINGLY, EACH FISCAL YEAR NORMALLY CONSISTS OF 13 FOUR-WEEK PERIODS, OR ACCOUNTING PERIODS, ACCOUNTING FOR 364 DAYS IN THE AGGREGATE. HOWEVER, EVERY FIFTH OR SIXTH YEAR, WE HAVE A FISCAL YEAR THAT CONSISTS OF 53 WEEKS, ACCOUNTING FOR 371 DAYS IN THE AGGREGATE. THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER CONSISTS OF FOUR FOUR-WEEK PERIODS, OR 16 WEEKS, AND THE REMAINING THREE QUARTERS TYPICALLY INCLUDES THREE FOUR-WEEK PERIODS, OR 12 WEEKS, IN LENGTH. THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER INCLUDES 13 WEEKS IN CERTAIN FISCAL YEARS TO ADJUST FOR OUR STANDARD 52 WEEK, OR 364 DAY, FISCAL YEAR COMPARED TO THE 365 DAY CALENDAR YEAR. COMPARABILITY BETWEEN QUARTERS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE VARYING LENGTHS OF THE QUARTERS, AS WELL AS THE SEASONALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS.  SAME-STORE SALES  THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT TO FOOD QUALITY, CONCEPT, LOCATION, PRICE, AND SERVICE, ALL OF WHICH MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON SAME-STORE SALES. OUR SAME-STORE SALES CALCULATION MEASURES THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF A CERTAIN GROUP OF RESTAURANTS. A RESTAURANT\u2019S SALES RESULTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE SAME-STORE SALES CALCULATION IN THE QUARTER AFTER A STORE HAS BEEN OPEN FOR SIX CONSECUTIVE FISCAL QUARTERS. STORES THAT CLOSE ON A PERMANENT BASIS (OR ON A TEMPORARY BASIS FOR REMODELING) ARE REMOVED FROM THE GROUP IN THE QUARTER WHEN OPERATIONS CEASE AT THE RESTAURANT, BUT REMAIN IN THE SAME-STORE GROUP FOR PREVIOUSLY REPORTED QUARTERS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS APPROACH LEADS TO MORE EFFECTIVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISONS, NEITHER THE TIME FRAME NOR THE EXACT PRACTICE MAY BE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY OTHER RESTAURANT COMPANIES.  33  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 19, 2018  COMPARED TO QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 20, 2017  COMPARABILITY BETWEEN QUARTERS IS AFFECTED BY THE VARYING LENGTHS OF THE QUARTERS AND QUARTERS ENDING AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN THE CALENDAR YEAR WHEN SEASONAL PATTERNS FOR SALES ARE DIFFERENT.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A GLOBAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION AND DERIVE OUR OPERATING REVENUES AND NET INCOME FROM PROVIDING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SERVICES TO INVESTORS IN JURISDICTIONS WORLDWIDE THROUGH OUR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS WHICH INCLUDE OUR SPONSORED FUNDS, AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONAL AND HIGH NET-WORTH SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. IN ADDITION TO INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, OUR SERVICES INCLUDE FUND ADMINISTRATION, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION, MARKETING, SHAREHOLDER SERVICING AND OTHER SERVICES. OUR PRODUCTS AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SERVICES ARE DISTRIBUTED OR MARKETED TO INVESTORS GLOBALLY UNDER VARIOUS DISTINCT BRAND NAMES, INCLUDING: FRANKLIN  \u00ae  , TEMPLETON  \u00ae  , FRANKLIN MUTUAL SERIES  \u00ae  , FRANKLIN BISSETT  \u00ae  , FIDUCIARY TRUSTTM, DARBY  \u00ae  , BALANCED EQUITY MANAGEMENT  \u00ae  , K2  \u00ae  , LIBERTYSHARES  \u00ae  AND EDINBURGH PARTNERSTM. WE OFFER A BROAD PRODUCT MIX OF EQUITY, MULTI-ASSET/BALANCED, FIXED INCOME AND CASH MANAGEMENT FUNDS AND ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, WHICH MEET A WIDE VARIETY OF SPECIFIC INVESTMENT NEEDS OF INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS. WE ALSO PROVIDE SUB-ADVISORY SERVICES TO CERTAIN INVESTMENT PRODUCTS SPONSORED BY OTHER COMPANIES WHICH MAY BE SOLD TO INVESTORS UNDER THE BRAND NAMES OF THOSE OTHER COMPANIES OR ON A CO-BRANDED BASIS.  THE LEVEL OF OUR REVENUES DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE LEVEL AND RELATIVE MIX OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT (\u201cAUM\u201d). AS NOTED IN THE \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTION SET FORTH BELOW, THE AMOUNT AND MIX OF OUR AUM ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS AND CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND INCOME. THE LEVEL OF OUR REVENUES ALSO DEPENDS ON MUTUAL FUND SALES, THE NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDER TRANSACTIONS AND ACCOUNTS, AND THE FEES CHARGED FOR OUR SERVICES, WHICH ARE BASED ON CONTRACTS WITH OUR FUNDS OR OUR CLIENTS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.  DURING OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER, THE GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS EXPERIENCED SHARP DECLINES AS THE S&P 500 INDEX AND MSCI WORLD INDEX DECREASED  13.5%  AND  13.3%  AMID ONGOING CONCERNS ABOUT SLOWING ECONOMIC GROWTH, GLOBAL TRADE TENSIONS AND RISING INTEREST RATES, AMONG OTHER THINGS. THE GLOBAL BOND MARKETS WERE POSITIVE AS THE BLOOMBERG BARCLAYS GLOBAL AGGREGATE INDEX INCREASED  1.2%  DURING THE QUARTER.  OUR TOTAL AUM AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS  $649.9 BILLION  ,  9%  LOWER  THAN AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  AND  14%  LOWER  THAN AT  DECEMBER 31, 2017  . SIMPLE MONTHLY AVERAGE AUM (\u201cAVERAGE AUM\u201d) FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  DECREASED  9%  FROM THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY REMAIN FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS WE CONTINUE TO CONFRONT THE CHALLENGES OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS, WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON THE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND ON PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO OUR CLIENTS. WE CONTINUOUSLY PERFORM REVIEWS OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL. WHILE WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON EXPENSE MANAGEMENT, WE WILL ALSO SEEK TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND DEVELOP EMPLOYEES AND INVEST STRATEGICALLY IN SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL PROVIDE A SECURE AND STABLE ENVIRONMENT. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK TO PROTECT AND FURTHER OUR BRAND RECOGNITION WHILE DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING BROKER-DEALER AND CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS.

PERFORMANCE-BASED INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES WERE  $4.1 MILLION  AND  $1.8 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  , WITH THE INCREASE PRIMARILY DUE TO FEES EARNED FROM A REAL ESTATE FUND.

SALARIES, WAGES AND BENEFITS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES OF  $8.2 MILLION  FROM HIGHER AVERAGE STAFFING LEVELS AND  $5.8 MILLION  FOR ANNUAL SALARY INCREASES THAT WERE EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2018 AND 2017. VARIABLE COMPENSATION INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES OF  $4.6 MILLION  FOR RETENTION BONUSES RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS AND  $1.1 MILLION  RELATED TO PRODUCT PERFORMANCE FEES.  VARIABLE COMPENSATION AS A PERCENTAGE OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS WAS  33%  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  .

WE CONTINUE TO PLACE A HIGH EMPHASIS ON OUR PAY FOR PERFORMANCE PHILOSOPHY. AS SUCH, ANY CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS OR CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF OUR INCENTIVE COMPENSATION OFFERINGS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT EXPENSES GOING FORWARD. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED INDIVIDUALS, OUR LEVEL OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT EXPENSES MAY INCREASE MORE QUICKLY OR DECREASE MORE SLOWLY THAN OUR REVENUE.  INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY  INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY EXPENSES  INCREASED  $5.9 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER TECHNOLOGY CONSULTING AND EXTERNAL DATA SERVICE COSTS.

GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES  INCREASED  $19.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO A  $13.9 MILLION  LITIGATION SETTLEMENT AND HIGHER PROFESSIONAL FEES AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICE AND FUND ADMINISTRATION FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER CIPS EXPENSES. PROFESSIONAL FEES INCREASED  $7.3 MILLION  PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE IMMINENT ACQUISITION OF BENEFIT STREET PARTNERS L.L.C. THIRD-PARTY FEES PRIMARILY FOR SUB-ADVISORY AND FUND ADMINISTRATION SERVICES INCREASED  $7.1 MILLION  , INCLUDING  $2.2 MILLION  FROM THE RECOGNITION OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS REIMBURSED BY FUNDS AS EXPENSE UPON ADOPTION OF NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON  OCTOBER 1, 2018  . THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A  $6.0 MILLION  DECREASE IN CIPS EXPENSES.  WE ARE COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION IN RESPONSE TO CHANGING BUSINESS CONDITIONS, AND TO ADVANCE OUR PRODUCTS WHERE WE SEE CONTINUED OR POTENTIAL NEW GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. AS A RESULT OF POTENTIAL CHANGES IN OUR STRATEGIC MARKETING CAMPAIGNS, THE LEVEL OF ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION EXPENSES MAY INCREASE MORE RAPIDLY, OR DECREASE MORE SLOWLY, THAN OUR REVENUES.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSES), NET  DECREASED  $136.0 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER MARKET VALUATIONS WHICH RESULTED IN LOSSES FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES, INVESTMENTS HELD BY CIPS AND INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE COMPANY, AS COMPARED TO GAINS FROM EACH IN THE PRIOR YEAR. LOWER INTEREST INCOME ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DIVIDEND INCOME. EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES GENERATED LOSSES OF  $37.6 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO INCOME OF  $35.2 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS HELD BY A GLOBAL EQUITY FUND AS COMPARED TO GAINS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. INVESTMENTS OF CIPS GENERATED NET LOSSES OF  $49.0 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO NET GAINS OF  $16.0 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE LOSSES WERE PRIMARILY FROM LOWER MARKET VALUATIONS OF HOLDINGS BY VARIOUS GLOBAL/INTERNATIONAL EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME FUNDS, A MULTI-ASSET/BALANCED FUND AND A U.S. FIXED INCOME FUND. INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE COMPANY GENERATED NET LOSSES OF  $15.8 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO NET GAINS OF  $0.6 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE LOSSES INCLUDE  $8.4 MILLION  FROM TRADING INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND  $7.5 MILLION  FROM EQUITY SECURITIES THAT WERE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE OR CARRIED AT COST PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF NEW FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON  OCTOBER 1, 2018  WHICH REQUIRES THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE SECURITIES TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. THE LOSSES PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM LOWER MARKET VALUATIONS OF VARIOUS NONCONSOLIDATED FUNDS AND OTHER DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. INTEREST INCOME DECREASED  $14.8 MILLION  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER LEVELS OF CASH EQUIVALENTS AND DEBT SECURITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST RATES. THE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A  $20.9 MILLION  INCREASE IN DIVIDEND INCOME PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN, AND YIELDS ON, MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE NET GAINS (LOSSES) OF CIPS ARE OFFSET IN NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  OUR INVESTMENTS IN SPONSORED FUNDS INCLUDE INITIAL CASH INVESTMENTS MADE IN THE COURSE OF LAUNCHING MUTUAL FUND AND OTHER INVESTMENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS FOR OTHER BUSINESS REASONS. THE MARKET CONDITIONS THAT IMPACT OUR AUM SIMILARLY AFFECT THE INVESTMENT INCOME EARNED OR LOSSES INCURRED ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN SPONSORED FUNDS.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO BY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND ACCOUNTING CLASSIFICATION AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , EXCLUDING THIRD-PARTY ASSETS OF CIPS, WAS AS FOLLOWS.

TAXES ON INCOME  THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cTAX ACT\u201d), WHICH WAS ENACTED INTO LAW IN THE U.S. IN DECEMBER 2017, INCLUDES VARIOUS CHANGES TO THE TAX LAW, INCLUDING A PERMANENT REDUCTION IN THE CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM  35%  TO  21%  EFFECTIVE  JANUARY 1, 2018  AND ASSESSMENT OF A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON THE DEEMED REPATRIATION OF POST-1986 UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 EARNINGS. WE COMPLETED OUR ANALYSIS OF THE TAX ACT IMPACT DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WITH NO SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY RECORDED. THE TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY OF  $982.8 MILLION  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  IS NET OF AN  $87.6 MILLION  TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO U.S. TAXATION OF DEEMED FOREIGN DIVIDENDS. THIS BENEFIT MAY BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED BY FUTURE REGULATION OR LEGISLATION. THE TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY MAY ALSO BE ADJUSTED IN THE FUTURE UPON ISSUANCE OF STATE LEGISLATIVE UPDATES ON TAX REFORM AND THE COMPLETION OF OUR TAX RETURN FILINGS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018.  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS  24.9%  AND  187.8%  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  . THE RATE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PRIOR YEAR IMPACT OF THE TRANSITION TAX, NET OF THE TAX BENEFIT FROM THE REVALUATION OF NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AT THE LOWER STATUTORY RATE, AND THE CURRENT YEAR IMPACT OF THE LOWER  21%  STATUTORY RATE AS COMPARED TO A BLENDED STATUTORY RATE OF  24.5%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS WILL CONTINUE TO REFLECT THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF EARNINGS BY JURISDICTIONS. CHANGES IN TAX RATES OR TAX LEGISLATION IN THESE JURISDICTIONS MAY AFFECT OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE AND NET INCOME.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH FLOWS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  (IN MILLIONS)  2018  2017  OPERATING CASH FLOWS  $266.0  $320.4  INVESTING CASH FLOWS  (110.3  )  (58.6  )  FINANCING CASH FLOWS  (396.1  )  (51.1  )  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO ACTIVITIES OF CIPS WHICH HAD A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AS COMPARED TO AN INCREASE IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN RECEIVABLES AS COMPARED TO AN INCREASE IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS AND NET PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS OF CIPS AS COMPARED TO NET LIQUIDATIONS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NET SUBSCRIPTIONS IN CIPS BY NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND HIGHER REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK.  THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF CIPS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS DO NOT IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO THE CIPS\u2019 ASSETS, OTHER THAN OUR DIRECT EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THEM AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES EARNED FROM THEM. THE DEBT HOLDERS OF THE CIPS HAVE NO RECOURSE TO OUR ASSETS BEYOND THE LEVEL OF OUR DIRECT INVESTMENT, THEREFORE WE BEAR NO OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CIPS\u2019 LIABILITIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF CIPS, OTHER THAN OUR DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN THEM, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE AMOUNTS AND DISCUSSION BELOW.  OUR LIQUID ASSETS AND DEBT CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING.  (IN MILLIONS)  DECEMBER 31,  2018  SEPTEMBER 30,  2018  ASSETS  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $6,430.7  $6,610.8  RECEIVABLES  723.9  733.7  INVESTMENTS  1,985.0  2,130.6  TOTAL LIQUID ASSETS  $9,139.6  $9,475.1  LIABILITY  DEBT  $697.7  $695.9  LIQUIDITY  LIQUID ASSETS CONSIST OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES AND CERTAIN INVESTMENTS. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  PRIMARILY CONSIST OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND DEPOSITS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. LIQUID INVESTMENTS CONSIST OF DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN REDEEMABLE CIPS, INVESTMENTS IN SPONSORED AND OTHER FUNDS, OTHER EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES AND TIME DEPOSITS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS.  WE UTILIZE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR LIQUID ASSETS TO SATISFY OPERATIONAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND FUND CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS RELATING TO OUR PRODUCTS. CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED BY OUR INTERNAL POLICY OR REGULATION TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM LEVELS OF CAPITAL WHICH ARE PARTIALLY MAINTAINED BY RETAINING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. AS A RESULT, SUCH SUBSIDIARIES MAY BE RESTRICTED IN THEIR ABILITY TO TRANSFER CASH TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , OUR SUBSIDIARIES HELD  $3,340.4 MILLION  OF LIQUID ASSETS TO SATISFY OPERATIONAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PRODUCTS, AS COMPARED TO  $3,382.6 MILLION  HELD AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  . INCLUDED IN THESE AMOUNTS WERE LIQUID ASSETS RESTRICTED BY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FROM TRANSFER TO FRANKLIN AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF  $242.8 MILLION  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  $252.6 MILLION  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  . SHOULD WE REQUIRE MORE CAPITAL THAN IS AVAILABLE FOR USE, WE COULD ELECT TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS SHARE REPURCHASES, OR WE COULD RAISE CAPITAL THROUGH DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUANCE. THESE ALTERNATIVES COULD RESULT IN INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE OR OTHER DILUTION TO OUR EARNINGS.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN MEET OUR PRESENT AND REASONABLY FORESEEABLE OPERATING CASH NEEDS AND FUTURE COMMITMENTS THROUGH EXISTING LIQUID ASSETS, CONTINUING CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, THE ABILITY TO ISSUE DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES AND BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR UNCOMMITTED PRIVATE PLACEMENT PROGRAM.  IN PRIOR FISCAL YEARS, WE ISSUED SENIOR UNSECURED UNSUBORDINATED NOTES FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, TO REDEEM OUTSTANDING NOTES AND TO FINANCE AN ACQUISITION. AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  ,  $699.3 MILLION  OF THE NOTES WERE OUTSTANDING WITH AN AGGREGATE FACE VALUE OF  $700.0 MILLION  . THE NOTES WERE ISSUED AT FIXED INTEREST RATES AND CONSIST OF  $300.0 MILLION  AT  2.800%  PER ANNUM WHICH MATURE IN  2022  AND  $400.0 MILLION  AT  2.850%  PER ANNUM WHICH MATURE IN  2025.  INTEREST ON THE NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY. THE NOTES CONTAIN AN OPTIONAL REDEMPTION FEATURE THAT ALLOWS US TO REDEEM EACH SERIES OF NOTES PRIOR TO MATURITY IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT ANY TIME, AT A MAKE-WHOLE REDEMPTION PRICE. THE INDENTURES GOVERNING THE NOTES CONTAIN LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY AND THE ABILITY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO PLEDGE VOTING STOCK OR PROFIT PARTICIPATING EQUITY INTERESTS IN OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO SECURE OTHER DEBT WITHOUT SIMILARLY SECURING THE NOTES EQUALLY AND RATABLY. THE INDENTURES ALSO INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS THAT MUST BE MET IF WE CONSOLIDATE OR MERGE WITH, OR SELL ALL OF OUR ASSETS TO, ANOTHER ENTITY. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL DEBT COVENANTS AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD  $500.0 MILLION  OF SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER AN UNCOMMITTED PRIVATE PLACEMENT PROGRAM WHICH HAS BEEN INACTIVE SINCE  2012.  OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS IN A TIMELY MANNER DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR CREDIT RATING, THE CONDITION OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, INVESTORS\u2019 WILLINGNESS TO PURCHASE OUR SECURITIES, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT SPREADS AND THE VALUATION LEVELS OF EQUITY MARKETS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS IN A TIMELY MANNER, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.  USES OF CAPITAL  WE EXPECT THAT OUR MAIN USES OF CASH WILL BE TO INVEST IN AND GROW OUR BUSINESS, REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, INVEST IN OUR PRODUCTS, FUND PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES, PAY OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE BUSINESS, ENHANCE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUSINESS PROCESSES, PAY STOCKHOLDER DIVIDENDS AND INCOME TAXES, AND REPAY AND SERVICE DEBT.  WE DECLARE DIVIDENDS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. WE DECLARED REGULAR DIVIDENDS OF  $0.26  AND  $0.23  PER SHARE DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  . WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO CONTINUE PAYING COMPARABLE REGULAR DIVIDENDS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK DEPENDING UPON EARNINGS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS.  WE MAINTAIN A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO MANAGE OUR EQUITY CAPITAL WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF MAXIMIZING SHAREHOLDER VALUE. OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EFFECTED THROUGH REGULAR OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES AND PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO AN EXPIRATION DATE. THE SIZE AND TIMING OF THESE PURCHASES WILL DEPEND ON PRICE, MARKET AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. WE REPURCHASED  10.7 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A COST OF  $326.9 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , AND  4.6 MILLION  SHARES AT A COST OF  $200.0 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  ,  61.0 MILLION  SHARES REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER THE AUTHORIZATION APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN APRIL 2018.  WE INVESTED  $6.5 MILLION  , NET OF REDEMPTIONS, INTO OUR SPONSORED PRODUCTS DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , AND REDEEMED  $91.3 MILLION  , NET OF INVESTMENTS, IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.  ON  OCTOBER 24, 2018  , WE ENTERED INTO AN ACQUISITION AGREEMENT WITH A PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY  $683 MILLION  IN CASH.  THE FUNDS THAT WE MANAGE HAVE THEIR OWN RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR PURPOSES OF PROVIDING LIQUIDITY TO MEET SHAREHOLDER REDEMPTIONS, INCLUDING SECURITIES THAT CAN BE SOLD OR PROVIDED TO INVESTORS AS IN-KIND REDEMPTIONS, AND LINES OF CREDIT. WHILE WE HAVE NO CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO DO SO, WE MAY VOLUNTARILY ELECT TO PROVIDE THE FUNDS WITH DIRECT OR INDIRECT FINANCIAL SUPPORT BASED ON OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. WE DID NOT PROVIDE FINANCIAL OR OTHER SUPPORT TO OUR SPONSORED FUNDS DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . DURING FISCAL YEAR  2018  , WE PURCHASED  $32.6 MILLION  OF CERTAIN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES FROM TWO SPONSORED FUNDS. NONE OF THESE PURCHASES OCCURRED DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITY  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITY AND FEDERAL TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY AS REPORTED IN OUR FORM 10\u2010K FOR FISCAL YEAR  2018.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHICH REQUIRE THE USE OF ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY OUR APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES. THE FOLLOWING ARE UPDATES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCLOSED IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN OUR FORM 10-K FOR FISCAL YEAR  2018.  CONSOLIDATION  WE CONSOLIDATE OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND INVESTMENT PRODUCTS IN WHICH WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST WHEN WE OWN A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING INTEREST IN A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY (\u201cVOE\u201d) OR ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (\u201cVIE\u201d). SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR VIES ARE INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND OUR VARIABLE INTERESTS CONSIST OF OUR EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES EARNED FROM THESE PRODUCTS. AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE WERE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF 32 INVESTMENT PRODUCT VIES.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF OUR INVESTMENTS IS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE OR AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS. WE USE A THREE-LEVEL FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY THAT PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE BASED ON WHETHER THE INPUTS TO THOSE VALUATION TECHNIQUES ARE OBSERVABLE OR UNOBSERVABLE.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , LEVEL 3 ASSETS REPRESENTED  14%  OF TOTAL ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH RELATED TO CIPS\u2019 INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES. THERE WAS ONE LEVEL 3 LIABILITY, A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY WHICH WAS THE ONLY LIABILITY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THERE WERE  $31.1 MILLION  OF TRANSFERS OUT OF AND INSIGNIFICANT TRANSFERS INTO LEVEL 3 DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  WE ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON  OCTOBER 1, 2018  THAT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES TO BE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE WITH CHANGES RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS, EXCEPT FOR THOSE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THE POLICY DESCRIPTION FOR EQUITY SECURITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AND THEIR FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGIES IS AS FOLLOWS.  EQUITY SECURITIES, AT FAIR VALUE  CONSIST OF INVESTMENTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED SPONSORED FUNDS AND OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS GAINS AND LOSSES IN EARNINGS. THE FAIR VALUE OF FUNDS IS DETERMINED BASED ON THEIR PUBLISHED NET ASSET VALUE (\u201cNAV\u201d) OR ESTIMATED USING NAV AS A PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY SECURITIES OTHER THAN FUNDS IS DETERMINED USING INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY BROKER OR DEALER PRICE QUOTES OR BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS.  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  SUBSEQUENT TO OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS AS OF AUGUST 1,  2018  , THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENTS TO GOODWILL OR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. WE MONITORED MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN OUR AUM AND WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE ANNUAL CALCULATIONS OF FAIR VALUE TO DETERMINE WHETHER CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE, OR INDICATE THAT THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS MIGHT BE IMPAIRED. WE ALSO MONITORED FLUCTUATIONS OF OUR COMMON STOCK PER SHARE PRICE TO EVALUATE OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION RELATIVE TO THE REPORTING UNIT AS A WHOLE.  WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE IN OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS ARE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE, FUTURE CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD RESULT IN RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT.  REVENUES  WE EARN REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM PROVIDING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY INVESTMENT PRODUCTS OR INVESTORS IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. IN ADDITION TO INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, SERVICES INCLUDE FUND ADMINISTRATION, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION, AND SHAREHOLDER SERVICING. REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN OUR OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THE SERVICES ARE SATISFIED AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL OF THE REVENUE AMOUNT WOULD NOT OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED OVER TIME AS THE SERVICES ARE RENDERED, EXCEPT FOR THE SALES AND DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS FOR THE SALE OF SHARES OF SPONSORED FUNDS, WHICH ARE SATISFIED ON TRADE DATE. MULTIPLE SERVICES INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY WHEN THE OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED TO BE DISTINCT.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FEES FROM PROVIDING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND FUND ADMINISTRATION SERVICES (\u201cINVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES\u201d), OTHER THAN PERFORMANCE-BASED INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES, ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF AUM, PRIMARILY ON A MONTHLY BASIS USING DAILY AVERAGE AUM, AND ARE RECOGNIZED AS THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED OVER TIME. PERFORMANCE-BASED INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES ARE GENERATED WHEN WE EXCEED PERFORMANCE TARGETS ESTABLISHED IN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS. THESE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE AMOUNT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL AND MAY RELATE TO INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES THAT WERE PROVIDED IN PRIOR PERIODS.  SALES AND DISTRIBUTION FEES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF UPFRONT SALES COMMISSIONS AND ONGOING DISTRIBUTION FEES. SALES COMMISSIONS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL RATES FOR SALES OF CERTAIN CLASSES OF SPONSORED FUNDS AND ARE RECOGNIZED ON TRADE DATE. DISTRIBUTION SERVICE FEES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF AUM, PRIMARILY ON A MONTHLY BASIS USING DAILY AVERAGE AUM. AS THE FEE AMOUNTS ARE UNCERTAIN ON TRADE DATE THEY ARE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME AS THE AMOUNTS BECOME KNOWN AND MAY RELATE TO SALES AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES PROVIDED IN PRIOR PERIODS.  SHAREHOLDER SERVICING FEES ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF AUM ON A MONTHLY BASIS USING DAILY AVERAGE AUM AND EITHER THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN SHAREHOLDER ACCOUNTS OR THE NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDER ACCOUNTS, WHILE FEES FROM CERTAIN INVESTMENT PRODUCTS ARE BASED ONLY ON AUM. THESE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED AS THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED OVER TIME.  AUM IS GENERALLY BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES HELD BY OUR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND IS CALCULATED USING FAIR VALUE METHODS DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM UNADJUSTED QUOTED MARKET PRICES, UNADJUSTED INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY BROKER OR DEALER PRICE QUOTES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, OR MARKET PRICES OR PRICE QUOTES ADJUSTED FOR OBSERVABLE PRICE MOVEMENTS AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE PRIMARY MARKET IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S GLOBAL VALUATION AND PRICING POLICY. THE FAIR VALUES OF SECURITIES FOR WHICH MARKET PRICES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE ARE VALUED INTERNALLY USING VARIOUS METHODOLOGIES WHICH INCORPORATE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AS APPROPRIATE FOR EACH SECURITY TYPE. AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , OUR TOTAL AUM BY FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY LEVEL WAS  49%  LEVEL 1,  50%  LEVEL 2 AND  1%  LEVEL 3. AS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR AUM IS VALUED BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES OR INPUTS, MARKET RISK IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK UNDERLYING THE VALUATION OF OUR AUM.  NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  SEE NOTE  2  \u2013 NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS FORM 10\u2010Q.  RISK FACTORS  VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION OF THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS, AND ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND MAY PUT PRESSURE ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY FROM TIME TO TIME EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION WORLDWIDE. DECLINES IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE IN THE PAST RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT (\u201cAUM\u201d), REVENUES AND INCOME, AND FUTURE DECLINES MAY FURTHER NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. SUCH DECLINES HAVE HAD AND MAY IN THE FUTURE HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE MAY NEED TO MODIFY OUR BUSINESS, STRATEGIES OR OPERATIONS AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS OR COSTS IN ORDER TO COMPETE IN A CHANGING GLOBAL ECONOMY AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT.  THE AMOUNT AND MIX OF OUR AUM ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS  . FLUCTUATIONS IN THE AMOUNT AND MIX OF OUR AUM MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE IN PART TO MARKET CONDITIONS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL THAT HAVE HAD, AND IN THE FUTURE COULD HAVE, A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES AND INCOME. WE DERIVE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR OPERATING REVENUES AND NET INCOME FROM PROVIDING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SERVICES TO INVESTORS IN JURISDICTIONS WORLDWIDE THROUGH OUR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS WHICH INCLUDE OUR SPONSORED FUNDS, AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONAL AND HIGH NET-WORTH SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. IN ADDITION TO INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, OUR SERVICES INCLUDE FUND ADMINISTRATION, SALES, DISTRIBUTION, MARKETING, SHAREHOLDER SERVICING, AND OTHER SERVICES. THE LEVEL OF OUR REVENUES DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE LEVEL AND MIX OF AUM. OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE VALUE OF AUM AND VARY WITH THE NATURE AND STRATEGIES OF OUR PRODUCTS. ANY DECREASE IN THE VALUE OR AMOUNT OF OUR AUM BECAUSE OF MARKET VOLATILITY OR OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS A DECLINE IN THE PRICE OF STOCKS, IN PARTICULAR MARKET SEGMENTS OR IN THE SECURITIES MARKET GENERALLY, NEGATIVELY IMPACTS OUR REVENUES AND INCOME. WE ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISK OF ASSET VOLATILITY FROM CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL, EQUITY, DEBT AND COMMODITY MARKETS. INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL, EQUITY, DEBT AND COMMODITY MARKETS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, ELECTORAL, DIPLOMATIC OR OTHER INSTABILITIES THAT ARE PARTICULAR TO THE COUNTRY OR REGION IN WHICH A MARKET IS LOCATED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOCAL ACTS OF TERRORISM, ECONOMIC CRISES, POLITICAL PROTESTS, INSURRECTION OR OTHER BUSINESS, SOCIAL OR POLITICAL CRISES. GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, EXACERBATED BY WAR, TERRORISM, NATURAL DISASTERS OR FINANCIAL CRISES, CHANGES IN THE EQUITY, DEBT OR COMMODITY MARKETPLACES, CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, INFLATION RATES, THE YIELD CURVE, DEFAULTS BY TRADING COUNTERPARTIES, BOND DEFAULTS, REVALUATION AND BOND MARKET LIQUIDITY RISKS, GEOPOLITICAL RISKS, THE IMPOSITION OF ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, AFFECT THE MIX, MARKET VALUES AND LEVELS OF OUR AUM. FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL MARKET PRICES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND/OR INTEREST RATES HAVE IN THE PAST AND COULD IN THE FUTURE CAUSE THE VALUE OF OUR AUM TO DECLINE, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN LOWER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUES. CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS COULD ALSO CAUSE AN IMPAIRMENT TO THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. OUR FUNDS MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIQUIDITY RISKS OR AN UNANTICIPATED LARGE NUMBER OF REDEMPTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE EVENTS OR CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, CAUSING THE FUNDS TO SELL SECURITIES THEY HOLD, POSSIBLY AT A LOSS, OR DRAW ON ANY AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT, TO OBTAIN CASH TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY OR SETTLE THESE REDEMPTIONS, OR SETTLE IN-KIND WITH SECURITIES HELD IN THE APPLICABLE FUND. WE HAVE IN THE PAST, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE, AT OUR DISCRETION, PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO OUR FUNDS TO ENABLE THEM TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY IN ANY SUCH EVENT. CHANGES IN INVESTOR PREFERENCES REGARDING OUR MORE POPULAR PRODUCTS HAVE IN THE PAST AND COULD IN THE FUTURE CAUSE SIZABLE REDEMPTIONS AND LOWER THE VALUE OF OUR AUM, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN LOWER REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS. MOREOVER, CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE A SHIFT IN OUR ASSET MIX BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. ASSETS, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN A DECLINE IN OUR REVENUES AND INCOME DEPENDING UPON THE NATURE OF OUR AUM AND THE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT FEES WE EARN BASED ON OUR AUM. WE GENERALLY DERIVE HIGHER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION FEES FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTS THAN FROM OUR U.S. PRODUCTS, AND HIGHER SALES FEES FROM OUR U.S. PRODUCTS THAN FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE A SHIFT IN OUR ASSET MIX TOWARDS FIXED INCOME PRODUCTS AND AWAY FROM EQUITY AND MULTI-ASSET/BALANCED PRODUCTS, AND A RELATED DECLINE IN OUR REVENUES AND INCOME, AS WE GENERALLY DERIVE HIGHER FEE REVENUES AND INCOME FROM OUR EQUITY AND CERTAIN MULTI-ASSET/BALANCED PRODUCTS THAN FROM OUR FIXED INCOME PRODUCTS. FURTHER, CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS AND INVESTOR PREFERENCES ALSO MAY CAUSE A SHIFT IN OUR ASSET MIX TOWARDS LOWER FEE EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS. INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES, IN PARTICULAR IF RAPID, AS WELL AS ANY UNCERTAINTY IN THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF INTEREST RATES, MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FIXED INCOME PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH THE SHORTER DURATION OF THE BOND INVESTMENTS IN MANY OF THESE PRODUCTS MAY HELP MITIGATE THE INTEREST RATE RISK, RISING INTEREST RATES OR INTEREST RATE UNCERTAINTY TYPICALLY DECREASE THE TOTAL RETURN ON MANY BOND INVESTMENTS DUE TO LOWER MARKET VALUATIONS OF EXISTING BONDS. ANY DECREASE IN THE LEVEL OF OUR AUM RESULTING FROM MARKET DECLINES, INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY OR UNCERTAINTY, INCREASED REDEMPTIONS OR OTHER FACTORS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND INCOME.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE, COMPLEX, OVERLAPPING AND FREQUENTLY CHANGING RULES, REGULATIONS, POLICIES, AND LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS.  THERE IS UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. AS DESCRIBED BELOW, OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND COMPLEX, OVERLAPPING AND/OR CONFLICTING, AND FREQUENTLY CHANGING AND INCREASING RULES, REGULATIONS, POLICIES AND LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. OUR REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL AND COST BURDENS ON US AND COVER A BROAD RANGE OF REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INVESTMENT AND ADVISORY MATTERS, ACCOUNTING, TAX, COMPENSATION, ETHICS, DATA PROTECTION, PRIVACY, SANCTIONS PROGRAMS, AND ESCHEATMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  AS A U.S. REPORTING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, STATE LAWS REGARDING SECURITIES FRAUD, OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND RULES AND REGULATIONS OF CERTAIN REGULATORY AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY, AMONG OTHERS, THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) AND THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE. AS A GLOBAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION, CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE SEC, THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY, THE U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (\u201cCFTC\u201d), THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (\u201cDOJ\u201d), THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (\u201cDOL\u201d) AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY. GIVEN OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS, OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE SECURITIES AND OTHER LAWS OF VARIOUS NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS, AND TO VARIOUS NON-U.S. AND CROSS-BORDER RULES AND REGULATIONS, SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN UNION\u2019S (\u201cEU\u201d) DATA PROTECTION RULES UNDER THE EU\u2019S GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (\u201cGDPR\u201d). OUR NON-U.S. REGULATORS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE UNITED KINGDOM (\u201cU.K.\u201d) FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY, THE LUXEMBOURG COMMISSION DE SURVEILLANCE DU SECTEUR FINANCIER, THE CANADIAN PROVINCIAL AND TERRITORIAL SECURITIES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, THE MONETARY AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE, THE AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS COMMISSION, THE HONG KONG SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA, THE JAPANESE FINANCIAL SERVICES AGENCY AND VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL STOCK EXCHANGES. OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY U.S. REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE SEC, THE CFTC AND THE DOJ (FOR EXAMPLE, WITH RESPECT TO THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT OF 1977). WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT NOT ONLY TO THE SANCTIONS PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\u2019S OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL, BUT ALSO TO SANCTIONS PROGRAMS ADOPTED AND ADMINISTERED BY NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING THE EU, WHERE OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS ARE OFFERED. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF STATES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS REGARDING THE REPORTING AND ESCHEATMENT OF UNCLAIMED OR ABANDONED PROPERTY. FURTHER, CERTAIN FEDERAL AND STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER OR BUSINESS COMBINATION LAWS MAY IMPOSE VARIOUS DISCLOSURE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE ABILITY OF A PERSON TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF US, WHICH MAY DISCOURAGE POTENTIAL MERGER AND ACQUISITION PROPOSALS AND MAY DELAY, DETER OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL, INCLUDING THROUGH TRANSACTIONS THAT SOME STOCKHOLDERS MAY CONSIDER DESIRABLE.  CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGISTERED WITH THE SEC UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940, THE CFTC AND/OR REGISTERED WITH OR LICENSED BY VARIOUS NON-U.S. REGULATORS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR FUNDS ARE REGISTERED WITH THE SEC UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 (THE \u201cINVESTMENT COMPANY ACT\u201d) OR AUTHORIZED BY VARIOUS EUROPEAN AND OTHER NON-U.S. REGULATORS PURSUANT TO THE EU\u2019S UNDERTAKINGS FOR COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT IN TRANSFERABLE SECURITIES (\u201cUCITS\u201d) DIRECTIVE OR UNDER OTHER NON-U.S. LAWS IN EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA, ASIA-PACIFIC, CANADA AND LATIN AMERICA. THESE REGISTRATIONS, LICENSES AND AUTHORIZATIONS IMPOSE NUMEROUS OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS DETAILED OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS, ON SUCH SUBSIDIARIES AND SUCH FUNDS. OUR SUBSIDIARIES MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH COMPLEX TAX REGIMES.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, AND THE PROCESSES, CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THEM, ARE OFTEN COMPREHENSIVE AND COMPLEX. WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF NEW OR REVISED LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS OR BY CHANGES IN THE INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS. POLITICAL AND ELECTORAL CHANGES, DEVELOPMENTS AND CONFLICTS MAY ALSO INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY. WHILE MANAGEMENT HAS FOCUSED ATTENTION AND RESOURCES ON OUR COMPLIANCE POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES, NON-COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST REQUIREMENTS OR FIDUCIARY PRINCIPLES, OR OUR INABILITY TO KEEP UP WITH, OR ADAPT TO, AN EVER CHANGING, COMPLEX REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, COULD RESULT IN CIVIL LIABILITY, CRIMINAL LIABILITY AND/OR SANCTIONS AGAINST US, INCLUDING FINES AND CENSURES, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION FROM A PARTICULAR JURISDICTION OR MARKET OR THE REVOCATION OF LICENSES OR CHARTERS, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION, PROSPECTS, REVENUES AND INCOME. MOREOVER, ANY POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING OR REPORTING ERROR, WHETHER FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE, IF MATERIAL, COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.  THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2010 (THE \u201cDODD-FRANK ACT\u201d) AUTHORIZED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (\u201cFSOC\u201d), THE MANDATE OF WHICH IS TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO THREATS TO U.S. FINANCIAL STABILITY. SIMILARLY, THE U.S. AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE G-20 GROUP OF NATIONS HAVE EMPOWERED THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (\u201cFSB\u201d) TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND, IN A COORDINATED MANNER, TO THREATS TO GLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY. THE FSOC MAY DESIGNATE CERTAIN NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES AS SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (\u201cSIFIS\u201d), WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. THE FSB MAY DESIGNATE CERTAIN NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES AS GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (\u201cG-SIFIS\u201d); THE ADDITIONAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TRIGGERED BY ANY SUCH DESIGNATION ARE NOT YET ESTABLISHED. THE FSOC AND THE FSB, AS WELL AS OTHER GLOBAL REGULATORS INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, ARE CONSIDERING WHAT THREATS TO U.S., EU AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY, IF ANY, ARISE FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANIES AND/OR THE FUNDS THAT THEY SPONSOR OR MANAGE, AND WHETHER SUCH THREATS CAN BE MITIGATED BY TREATING SUCH ENTITIES AS SIFIS OR G-SIFIS AND/OR SUBJECTING THEM TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE OR ANY OF OUR FUNDS ARE DESIGNATED AS A SIFI OR G-SIFI, SUCH REGULATION, WHICH COULD INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO RISK-BASED CAPITAL, LEVERAGE, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT EXPOSURE, STRESS TESTING, RESOLUTION PLANS, EARLY REMEDIATION, AND CERTAIN RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS, COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. THE DODD-FRANK ACT, AS WELL AS OTHER LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES, IMPOSE OTHER RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON US, RESULTING IN INCREASED SCRUTINY AND OVERSIGHT OF OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT AS IMPLEMENTING RULES ARE ADOPTED AND BECOME EFFECTIVE. UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, WHICH IMPOSES A NUMBER OF REGULATIONS GOVERNING DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF SWAPS ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED, AND FURTHER CATEGORIES OF SWAPS ARE LIKELY TO BE REQUIRED, TO BE SUBMITTED FOR CLEARING BY A REGULATED CLEARING ORGANIZATION AND REPORTED ON A SWAP EXECUTION FACILITY. THE EU AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS, AND THERE IS SOME RISK THAT FULL MUTUAL RECOGNITION MAY NOT BE ACHIEVED BETWEEN THE VARIOUS REGIMES, AND DUPLICATION OF REGULATION AND TRANSACTION COSTS MAY RESULT. THESE AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE LIKELY TO IMPACT HOW WE MANAGE OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES BECAUSE OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN INCREASE IN THE COSTS AND EXPENSES OF UTILIZING SWAPS AND OTHER DERIVATIVES. IN ADDITION, THE SEC HAS ADOPTED RULES THAT HAVE CHANGED THE STRUCTURE AND OPERATION FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS, AND THAT WILL REQUIRE CERTAIN REGISTERED FUNDS TO ADOPT LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. (COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE LATTER WAS REQUIRED BY DECEMBER 1, 2018, AND OTHER ASPECTS ARE DELAYED UNTIL JUNE 1, 2019, SUBJECT TO FURTHER REGULATORY UPDATE.) THE SEC HAS ALSO PROPOSED A RULE THAT WOULD IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF DERIVATIVES BY REGISTERED FUNDS. WE EXPECT THAT THE COMPLEX REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS APPLICABLE TO US WILL CAUSE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE AND COMPLIANCE COSTS.  THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESS GENERALLY INVOLVE RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH A VARIETY OF TECHNICAL, SPECIALIZED, AND EXPANDING MATTERS AND CONCERNS. FOR EXAMPLE, COMPLIANCE WITH THE BANK SECRECY ACT OF 1970, ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND ECONOMIC, TRADE AND OTHER SANCTIONS, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, HAS TAKEN ON HEIGHTENED IMPORTANCE AS A RESULT OF EFFORTS TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LIMIT TERRORISM AND ACTIONS THAT UNDERMINE THE STABILITY, SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF COUNTRIES. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED REGULATION WITH RESPECT TO THE PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER PRIVACY AND THE NEED TO SECURE SENSITIVE CUSTOMER INFORMATION. AS WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THESE REQUIREMENTS OR FOCUS ON MEETING NEW OR EXPANDED ONES, WE MAY EXPEND A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME AND RESOURCES. ANY INABILITY TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAMES MAY SUBJECT US TO SANCTIONS OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS BY GOVERNMENTS AND/OR REGULATORS THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BROADER BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.  GLOBAL REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS AND REFORMS HAVE MADE THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE MORE COSTLY AND FUTURE ACTIONS AND REFORMS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED SUBSTANTIALLY AND MADE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COMPLEX BY, AMONG OTHER MEASURES, THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 AND THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001. SIMILARLY, THE SECURITIES AND RELATED LAWS OUTSIDE THE U.S. HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED SUBSTANTIALLY AND MADE MORE COMPLEX BY MEASURES SUCH AS THE EU\u2019S ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT FUND MANAGERS DIRECTIVE (\u201cAIFMD\u201d) AND MARKETS IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DIRECTIVE II (\u201cMIFID II\u201d). ALTHOUGH NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE U.K. AND EU REGARDING THE U.K.\u2019S PROPOSED WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EU (\u201cBREXIT\u201d) BEGAN IN JUNE 2017, IT IS STILL UNCLEAR WHAT TERMS MAY BE AGREED TO IN THE FINAL OUTCOME AND FOR ANY TRANSITIONAL PERIOD. ONGOING CHANGES IN THE EU\u2019S REGULATORY FRAMEWORK APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CHANGES RELATED TO BREXIT AND ANY OTHER CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE EU\u2019S MEMBER STATES, MAY ADD FURTHER COMPLEXITY TO OUR GLOBAL RISKS AND OPERATIONS. MOREOVER, THE ADOPTION OF NEW LAWS, REGULATIONS OR STANDARDS  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AND CHANGES IN THE INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS, REGULATIONS OR STANDARDS HAVE DIRECTLY AFFECTED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS. WITH NEW LAWS AND CHANGES IN INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING REQUIREMENTS, THE ASSOCIATED TIME WE MUST DEDICATE TO AND RELATED COSTS WE MUST INCUR IN MEETING THE REGULATORY COMPLEXITIES OF OUR BUSINESS HAVE INCREASED. IN PARTICULAR, CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND MIFID II STILL REQUIRE THE ADOPTION OF IMPLEMENTING RULES. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT TIME AND RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE NEW REGULATIONS BEING ADOPTED PURSUANT TO THE DODD-FRANK ACT, MIFID II AND OTHER LAWS. FOR EXAMPLE, MIFID II REQUIRES THE \u201cUNBUNDLING\u201d OF RESEARCH AND EXECUTION CHARGES FOR TRADING. THE INDUSTRY\u2019S RESPONSE TO THE UNBUNDLING RULES IS STILL EVOLVING AND COULD LEAD TO INCREASED RESEARCH COSTS. OUTLAYS ASSOCIATED WITH MEETING REGULATORY COMPLEXITIES HAVE ALSO INCREASED AS WE EXPAND OUR BUSINESS INTO NEW JURISDICTIONS.  AS OF MAY 2018, THE EU\u2019S GDPR STRENGTHENED AND UNIFIED DATA PROTECTION RULES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE EU. THE GDPR ALSO ADDRESSES EXPORT OF PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE THE EU. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THE GDPR ARE TO GIVE CITIZENS CONTROL OF THEIR PERSONAL DATA AND TO SIMPLIFY THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS BY UNIFYING DATA PROTECTION REGULATION WITHIN THE EU. COMPLIANCE WITH THE STRINGENT DATA PROTECTION RULES UNDER THE GDPR REQUIRES AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF ALL OF OUR GLOBAL DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS. THE FAILURE TO COMPLY PROPERLY WITH GDPR RULES ON A TIMELY BASIS AND TO MAINTAIN ONGOING COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH RULES MAY SUBJECT US TO ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS AND SIGNIFICANT FINES AND COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE, A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE GDPR COULD RESULT IN FINES UP TO 20 MILLION EUROS OR 4% OF OUR ANNUAL GLOBAL REVENUES, WHICHEVER IS HIGHER.  FURTHER, PURSUANT TO ONGOING EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE GLOBAL TAX COMPLIANCE, THE ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT HAS ADOPTED A GLOBAL COMMON REPORTING STANDARD FOR THE AUTOMATIC EXCHANGE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION AMONG PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES (\u201cCRS\u201d), AIMED AT ENSURING THAT PERSONS WITH FINANCIAL ASSETS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THEIR TAX RESIDENCE COUNTRY PAY REQUIRED TAXES. IN MANY CASES, INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES WILL GOVERN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW CRS RULES. CRS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED OVER A MULTI-YEAR PERIOD AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS AND CORRESPONDING INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENTS TO DETERMINE OUR REQUIREMENTS. CRS MAY SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL REPORTING, COMPLIANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND BURDENS IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE OPERATE AS A QUALIFYING FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.  COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES TO ADDRESS THESE AND OTHER NEW LEGAL REQUIREMENTS HAVE REQUIRED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE, US TO EXPEND ADDITIONAL TIME AND RESOURCES, AND, CONSEQUENTLY, WE ARE INCURRING INCREASED COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS, WHICH POTENTIALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTS OUR PROFITABILITY AND FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS. FINALLY, ANY FURTHER REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS AND REFORMS AFFECTING THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE INITIATIVES, MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT REVENUES BY INCREASING OUR COSTS OF ACCESSING OR OPERATING IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS OR BY MAKING CERTAIN INVESTMENT OFFERINGS LESS FAVORABLE TO OUR CLIENTS.  FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS IN ANY OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL HARM TO OUR REPUTATION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  AS WITH ALL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, OUR ACTIVITIES ARE HIGHLY REGULATED IN ALMOST ALL COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS OF THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, OR WHERE OUR PRODUCTS ARE ORGANIZED OR SOLD, ARE COMPLEX, UNCERTAIN AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE. LOCAL REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS MAY VARY WIDELY AND PLACE ADDITIONAL DEMANDS ON OUR SALES, INVESTMENT, LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE PERSONNEL. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS, CODES, DIRECTIVES, NOTICES OR GUIDELINES IN ANY OF OUR JURISDICTIONS COULD RESULT IN A WIDE RANGE OF PENALTIES AND DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS, INCLUDING FINES, CENSURES AND THE SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION FROM A PARTICULAR JURISDICTION OR MARKET OR THE REVOCATION OF LICENSES, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION AND OPERATIONS. IN RECENT YEARS, THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASED AND EVOLVING REGULATIONS, WHICH HAVE IMPOSED AND MAY CONTINUE TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND COSTS ON US IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTIONS. REGULATORS COULD ALSO CHANGE THEIR POLICIES OR LAWS IN A MANNER THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR OTHERWISE IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO OFFER OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS, OR WE MAY BE UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH, OR ADAPT TO, THE EVER CHANGING, COMPLEX REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS OR MARKETS, WHICH COULD FURTHER NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS.  CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR EXPOSURE TO ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX LIABILITIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIQUIDITY.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES AS WELL AS NON-INCOME BASED TAXES, AND ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING TAX AUDITS, IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. TAX AUTHORITIES MAY DISAGREE WITH CERTAIN POSITIONS WE HAVE TAKEN AND ASSESS ADDITIONAL TAXES. WE REGULARLY ASSESS THE LIKELY OUTCOMES OF THESE AUDITS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF OUR TAX PROVISION. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ACCURATELY PREDICT THE OUTCOMES OF THESE AUDITS, AND THE ACTUAL OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR NET INCOME OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR TAX RULINGS MAY AT TIMES MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ENACTED INTO LAW IN THE U.S. IN DECEMBER 2017 INCLUDES VARIOUS CHANGES TO THE TAX LAW, INCLUDING A PERMANENT REDUCTION IN THE CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE AND ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON CERTAIN NON-U.S. EARNINGS.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ANY SIGNIFICANT LIMITATION, FAILURE OR SECURITY BREACH OF OUR INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE, SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER SYSTEMS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO OUR OPERATIONS COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS AND HARM OUR OPERATIONS AND REPUTATION.  WE ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE USE OF VARIOUS PROPRIETARY AND THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION AND SECURITY TECHNOLOGY, SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE CONTINUITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE, MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT AND REPORTING FRAMEWORK, POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CAPABILITIES TO PROTECT OUR COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND THE DATA THAT RESIDE ON OR ARE TRANSMITTED THROUGH THEM AND CONTRACTED THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS. WE USE TECHNOLOGY ON A DAILY BASIS IN OUR BUSINESS TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND OPERATIONS, PROCESS AND TRANSMIT CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS, STORE AND MAINTAIN DATA, OBTAIN SECURITIES PRICING INFORMATION, PROCESS CLIENT TRANSACTIONS, AND PROVIDE REPORTS AND OTHER CUSTOMER SERVICES TO OUR CLIENTS. ANY DISRUPTIONS, INACCURACIES, DELAYS, SYSTEMS FAILURES, DATA OR PRIVACY BREACHES, OR CYBER OR OTHER SECURITY BREACHES IN THESE AND OTHER PROCESSES COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT CLIENT DISSATISFACTION AND LOSSES AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PROTECTIVE MEASURES, INCLUDING MEASURES TO SECURE AND PROTECT INFORMATION THROUGH SYSTEM SECURITY TECHNOLOGY AND OUR INTERNAL SECURITY PROCEDURES, THE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS WE USE REMAIN VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, COMPUTER VIRUSES, POTENTIAL HUMAN ERRORS OR OTHER EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT, SUCH AS AN EXTERNAL OR INTERNAL HACKER ATTACK BY ONE OR MORE CYBER CRIMINALS (INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF PHISHING ATTACKS, MALWARE, RANSOMWARE AND OTHER METHODS AND ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO MALICIOUSLY OBTAIN AND EXPLOIT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TO OTHERWISE CAUSE DAMAGE) OR AN AUTHORIZED EMPLOYEE OR VENDOR INADVERTENTLY OR RECKLESSLY CAUSING US TO RELEASE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY HARM OUR OPERATIONS AND REPUTATION.  POTENTIAL SYSTEM DISRUPTIONS, FAILURES OR BREACHES OF THE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS WE USE OR THE SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE WE RELY UPON, AND THE COSTS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THEM, COULD RESULT IN: SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSS OR COSTS; THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR MODIFICATION OF SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL CLIENT AND BUSINESS INFORMATION; LOSS OF VALUABLE INFORMATION; BREACH OF CLIENT AND VENDOR CONTRACTS; LIABILITY FOR STOLEN ASSETS, INFORMATION OR IDENTITY; REMEDIATION COSTS TO REPAIR DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OR BREACH; ADDITIONAL SECURITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL COSTS TO MITIGATE AGAINST FUTURE INCIDENTS; REPUTATIONAL HARM; LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN OUR BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS; LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO PROPERLY AND TIMELY REVIEW AND DISCLOSE APPLICABLE INCIDENTS OR PROVIDE RELEVANT UPDATED DISCLOSURE; REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS OR ACTIONS; AND/OR LEGAL CLAIMS, LIABILITY AND LITIGATION COSTS RESULTING FROM THE INCIDENT. MOREOVER, LOSS OR UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR TRANSFER OF CONFIDENTIAL CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION COULD FURTHER HARM OUR REPUTATION AND SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY UNDER LAWS THAT PROTECT CONFIDENTIAL PERSONAL DATA, RESULTING IN INCREASED COSTS OR A DECLINE IN OUR REVENUES OR COMMON STOCK PRICE. FURTHER, ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO PASSWORD PROTECT AND ENCRYPT OUR LAPTOPS AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION ON OUR OTHER MOBILE ELECTRONIC DEVICES, IF SUCH DEVICES ARE STOLEN, MISPLACED OR LEFT UNATTENDED, THEY MAY BECOME VULNERABLE TO HACKING OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED USE, CREATING A POSSIBLE SECURITY RISK AND RESULTING IN POTENTIALLY COSTLY ACTIONS BY US.  IN ADDITION, DUE TO OUR INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH THIRD-PARTY VENDORS, ADVISORS, CENTRAL AGENTS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ANY OF THEM ARE SUBJECT TO A SUCCESSFUL CYBER ATTACK OR OTHER INFORMATION SECURITY EVENT, INCLUDING THOSE ARISING DUE TO THE USE OF MOBILE TECHNOLOGY OR A THIRD-PARTY CLOUD ENVIRONMENT. MOST OF THE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS THAT WE USE IN OUR BUSINESS ARE LICENSED FROM, AND SUPPORTED, UPGRADED AND MAINTAINED BY, THIRD-PARTY VENDORS. OUR THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS INCLUDE ENTERPRISE CLOUD STORAGE AND CLOUD COMPUTING APPLICATION SERVICES PROVIDED AND MAINTAINED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS. A SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF CERTAIN OF THESE LICENSES OR THE RELATED SUPPORT, UPGRADES AND MAINTENANCE COULD CAUSE TEMPORARY SYSTEM DELAYS OR INTERRUPTION THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. ALSO, OUR THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS MAY INCLUDE CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY DATA PROVIDED BY VENDORS AND BY US. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION COSTS AND LIABILITY TO THIRD PARTIES IF WE BREACH ANY CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS REGARDING VENDOR DATA, FOR LOSSES RELATED TO THE DATA, OR IF DATA WE PROVIDE IS DEEMED TO INFRINGE UPON THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS. IN ADDITION, THE FAILURE TO PROPERLY MANAGE AND OPERATE THE DATA CENTERS WE USE COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE IN PLACE CERTAIN DISASTER RECOVERY PLANS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE SYSTEM DELAYS AND INTERRUPTIONS AS A RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTERS, POWER FAILURES, ACTS OF WAR, AND THIRD-PARTY FAILURES. TECHNOLOGY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID ADVANCEMENTS AND CHANGES AND OUR COMPETITORS MAY FROM TIME TO TIME IMPLEMENT NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR MORE ADVANCED PLATFORMS FOR THEIR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING DIGITAL ADVISERS AND OTHER ADVANCED ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE.  OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE COMPLEX AND A FAILURE TO PROPERLY PERFORM OPERATIONAL TASKS OR THE MISREPRESENTATION OF OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, OR THE TERMINATION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR AUM, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND INCOME.  THROUGH OUR SUBSIDIARIES, WE PROVIDE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SERVICES TO INVESTORS GLOBALLY THROUGH OUR PRODUCTS. IN ORDER TO BE COMPETITIVE AND COMPLY WITH OUR AGREEMENTS, WE MUST PROPERLY PERFORM OUR FUND AND PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION AND RELATED RESPONSIBILITIES, INCLUDING PORTFOLIO RECORDKEEPING AND ACCOUNTING, SECURITY PRICING, CORPORATE ACTIONS, INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS COMPLIANCE, DAILY NET ASSET VALUE COMPUTATIONS, ACCOUNT RECONCILIATIONS, AND REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS TO FUND SHAREHOLDERS. MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE COMPLEX AND DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY PROCESS AND MONITOR A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH MAY OCCUR ACROSS NUMEROUS MARKETS AND CURRENCIES AT HIGH VOLUMES AND FREQUENCIES. ALTHOUGH WE EXPEND CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES ON INTERNAL CONTROLS, SUPERVISION, TECHNOLOGY AND TRAINING IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS DO NOT VIOLATE APPLICABLE GUIDELINES, RULES AND REGULATIONS OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CLIENTS, COUNTERPARTIES OR US, OUR OPERATIONS ARE ULTIMATELY DEPENDENT ON OUR EMPLOYEES AND SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL HUMAN ERRORS.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS INVOLVED IN OUR BUSINESS MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, MAKE MISTAKES THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS IMMEDIATELY DETECTED, WHICH MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS, CAUSE LOSSES, LEAD TO REGULATORY FINES OR SANCTIONS, OR OTHERWISE DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION. IN ADDITION, ANY MISREPRESENTATION OF OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS IN ADVERTISING MATERIALS, PUBLIC RELATIONS INFORMATION, SOCIAL MEDIA OR OTHER EXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS. OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES, WHICH REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES, ARE DEPENDENT ON FEES EARNED UNDER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR PRODUCTS. OUR REVENUES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF SUCH AGREEMENTS REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR AUM ARE TERMINATED OR SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED. FURTHER, CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY ACT AS GENERAL PARTNER FOR VARIOUS INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS, WHICH MAY SUBJECT THEM TO LIABILITY FOR THE PARTNERSHIPS\u2019 LIABILITIES. IF WE FAIL TO PROPERLY PERFORM AND MONITOR OUR OPERATIONS, OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER AND OUR REVENUES AND INCOME COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  WE FACE RISKS, AND CORRESPONDING POTENTIAL COSTS AND EXPENSES, ASSOCIATED WITH CONDUCTING OPERATIONS AND GROWING OUR BUSINESS IN NUMEROUS COUNTRIES.  WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS SUCH AS OUR FUNDS AND STRATEGIES, AND OFFER OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SERVICES, IN MANY DIFFERENT REGULATORY JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS INTERNATIONALLY. AS WE DO SO, WE WILL CONTINUE TO FACE CHALLENGES TO THE ADEQUACY OF OUR RESOURCES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS TO CONSISTENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, WE MUST BE PROACTIVE AND PREPARED TO IMPLEMENT NECESSARY RESOURCES WHEN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES PRESENT THEMSELVES, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF A BUSINESS ACQUISITION OR RAPIDLY INCREASING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN PARTICULAR MARKETS OR REGIONS. LOCAL REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS MAY VARY WIDELY IN TERMS OF SCOPE, ADEQUACY AND SOPHISTICATION. SIMILARLY, LOCAL DISTRIBUTORS, AND THEIR POLICIES AND PRACTICES AS WELL AS FINANCIAL VIABILITY, MAY ALSO VARY WIDELY, OR BE INCONSISTENT OR LESS DEVELOPED OR MATURE THAN OTHER MORE INTERNATIONALLY FOCUSED DISTRIBUTORS. NOTWITHSTANDING POTENTIAL LONG-TERM COST SAVINGS BY INCREASING CERTAIN OPERATIONS, SUCH AS TRANSFER AGENT AND OTHER BACK-OFFICE OPERATIONS, IN COUNTRIES OR REGIONS OF THE WORLD WITH LOWER OPERATING COSTS, GROWTH OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS MAY INVOLVE NEAR-TERM INCREASES IN EXPENSES AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL CAPITAL COSTS, SUCH AS INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND COSTS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH PARTICULAR REGULATORY OR OTHER LOCAL REQUIREMENTS OR NEEDS. LOCAL REQUIREMENTS OR NEEDS MAY ALSO PLACE ADDITIONAL DEMANDS ON SALES AND COMPLIANCE PERSONNEL AND RESOURCES, SUCH AS MEETING LOCAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS, WHILE ALSO INTEGRATING PERSONNEL INTO AN ORGANIZATION WITH A SINGLE OPERATING LANGUAGE. FINDING, HIRING AND RETAINING ADDITIONAL, WELL-QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND CRAFTING AND ADOPTING POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS TO ADDRESS LOCAL OR REGIONAL REQUIREMENTS REMAIN A CHALLENGE AS WE EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS INTERNATIONALLY. MOREOVER, REGULATORS IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS COULD ALSO CHANGE THEIR POLICIES OR LAWS IN A MANNER THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR OTHERWISE IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE OR AUTHORIZE PRODUCTS OR MAINTAIN THEIR AUTHORIZATIONS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS. ANY OF THESE LOCAL REQUIREMENTS, ACTIVITIES, OR NEEDS COULD INCREASE THE COSTS AND EXPENSES WE INCUR IN A SPECIFIC JURISDICTION WITHOUT ANY CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN REVENUES AND INCOME FROM OPERATING IN THE JURISDICTION. CERTAIN LAWS AND REGULATIONS BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE U.S. HAVE INCLUDED EXTRATERRITORIAL APPLICATION. THIS MAY LEAD TO DUPLICATIVE OR CONFLICTING LEGAL OR REGULATORY BURDENS AND ADDITIONAL COSTS AND RISKS. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME WE ENTER INTO JOINT VENTURES OR TAKE MINORITY STAKES IN COMPANIES IN WHICH WE TYPICALLY DO NOT HAVE CONTROL. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY INVOLVE RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLLING STAKEHOLDER OR OUR JOINT VENTURE PARTNER MAY HAVE BUSINESS INTERESTS, STRATEGIES OR GOALS THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH OURS, AND THE RISK THAT BUSINESS DECISIONS OR OTHER ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF THE CONTROLLING STAKEHOLDER, OUR JOINT VENTURE PARTNER OR THE ENTITY ITSELF MAY RESULT IN LIABILITY FOR US OR HARM TO OUR REPUTATION OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ENTITY.  WE DEPEND ON KEY PERSONNEL AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE LOSS OF THEIR SERVICES.  THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO DEPEND UPON OUR KEY PERSONNEL, INCLUDING OUR PORTFOLIO AND FUND MANAGERS, INVESTMENT ANALYSTS, INVESTMENT ADVISERS, SALES AND MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS AS WELL AS OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND BUSINESS UNIT HEADS. COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED, MOTIVATED, AND HIGHLY SKILLED EXECUTIVES, PROFESSIONALS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL IN THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY REMAINS SIGNIFICANT. OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS TO A SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE UPON OUR ABILITY TO FIND, ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING THROUGH COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION PACKAGES, AND UPON THE CONTINUED CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE PEOPLE. LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE CONTAINED IN OR RELATING TO THE EU\u2019S CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DIRECTIVE, THOSE ADOPTED UNDER AIFMD AND UCITS AND THOSE REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, COULD IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON COMPENSATION PAID BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY FOR QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS. AS OUR BUSINESS DEVELOPS, WE ARE LIKELY TO NEED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WE EMPLOY. MOREOVER, IN ORDER TO RETAIN CERTAIN KEY PERSONNEL, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INCREASE COMPENSATION TO SUCH INDIVIDUALS, RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN POTENTIAL REVENUES. IN ADDITION, DUE TO THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, OUR KEY PERSONNEL MAY FROM TIME TO TIME HAVE REASONS TO TRAVEL TO REGIONS SUSCEPTIBLE TO HIGHER RISK OF CIVIL UNREST, ORGANIZED CRIME OR TERRORISM, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR PERSONNEL TRAVELING TO SUCH REGIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING, ATTRACTING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS, AND THE DEPARTURE OF KEY INVESTMENT PERSONNEL, IN PARTICULAR, IF NOT REPLACED, COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE CLIENTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS.  STRONG COMPETITION FROM NUMEROUS AND SOMETIMES LARGER COMPANIES WITH COMPETING OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS COULD LIMIT OR REDUCE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN A DECLINE IN OUR MARKET SHARE, REVENUES AND INCOME.  WE COMPETE WITH NUMEROUS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, SECURITIES BROKERAGE AND INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. OUR PRODUCTS ALSO COMPETE WITH PRODUCTS OFFERED BY THESE COMPETITORS, AS WELL AS WITH REAL ESTATE  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVESTMENT TRUSTS, HEDGE FUNDS AND OTHER PRODUCTS. THE PERIODIC ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANIES AND OTHER COMPETITORS INCREASES THE COMPETITION THAT WE FACE. AT THE SAME TIME, CONSOLIDATION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS CREATED STRONGER COMPETITORS WITH GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND BROADER DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THAN OUR OWN. COMPETITION IS BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, BUSINESS REPUTATION, INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, PRODUCT MIX AND OFFERINGS, SERVICE QUALITY AND INNOVATION, DISTRIBUTION RELATIONSHIPS, AND FEES CHARGED. FURTHER, ALTHOUGH WE MAY OFFER CERTAIN TYPES OF EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS, TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A TREND AMONG EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CLIENTS IN FAVOR OF LOWER FEE INDEX AND OTHER EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS, IT MAY FAVOR OUR COMPETITORS WHO MAY OFFER SUCH PRODUCTS THAT ARE MORE ESTABLISHED OR ON A LARGER SCALE THAN WE DO. ADDITIONALLY, COMPETING SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS, WHOM WE RELY UPON TO DISTRIBUTE AND SELL CERTAIN OF OUR FUNDS AND OTHER PRODUCTS, MAY ALSO SELL THEIR OWN PROPRIETARY FUNDS AND PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD LIMIT THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT THAT EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CLIENTS, INCLUDING SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS, DECIDE TO INVEST IN OR DISTRIBUTE THE PRODUCTS OF OUR COMPETITORS, THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS OUR MARKET SHARE, REVENUES AND INCOME COULD DECLINE. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN AUM IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE RELATIVE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, OFFERING A MIX OF PRODUCTS AND STRATEGIES THAT MEETS INVESTOR DEMANDS, AND OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES AND PRICING STRUCTURE AT COMPETITIVE LEVELS.  CHANGES IN THE THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTION AND SALES CHANNELS ON WHICH WE DEPEND COULD REDUCE OUR INCOME AND HINDER OUR GROWTH.  WE DERIVE NEARLY ALL OF OUR FUND SALES THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKER-DEALERS, BANKS, INVESTMENT ADVISERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES. INCREASING COMPETITION FOR THESE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES HAVE CAUSED OUR DISTRIBUTION COSTS TO RISE AND COULD CAUSE FURTHER INCREASES IN THE FUTURE OR COULD OTHERWISE NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS. THE SEC HAS PROPOSED CHANGES TO RULE 12B-1 PROMULGATED UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT WHICH, IF ADOPTED, COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER EXPENSES RELATING TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR U.S.-REGISTERED FUNDS. HIGHER DISTRIBUTION COSTS LOWER OUR INCOME; CONSOLIDATIONS IN THE BROKER-DEALER INDUSTRY COULD ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR INCOME. MOREOVER, IF SEVERAL OF THE MAJOR FINANCIAL ADVISERS WHO DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS WERE TO CEASE OPERATIONS OR LIMIT OR OTHERWISE END THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS, IT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR INCOME. PURSUANT TO THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE SEC MAY ESTABLISH DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR BROKER-DEALERS IN THEIR INTERACTION WITH RETAIL CUSTOMERS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON SALES AND/OR DISTRIBUTION COSTS. IN APRIL 2018, THE SEC PROPOSED RULES THAT WOULD APPLY TO ALL RETAIL INVESTORS AND WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS: REQUIRE BROKER-DEALERS TO ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS WHEN RECOMMENDING SECURITIES AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE SCOPE AND TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP; CLARIFY THE FIDUCIARY DUTY THAT AN INVESTMENT ADVISER OWES TO ITS CLIENTS; AND REQUIRE A NEW SHORT-FORM DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT TO INFORM CLIENTS OF THE NATURE OF THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS, INCLUDING DIFFERENCES IN THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF SERVICES OFFERED, THE LEGAL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT THAT APPLY TO EACH, THE FEES A CLIENT MIGHT PAY, AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAT MAY EXIST. IN ADDITION, THE U.K., THE NETHERLANDS AND THE EU IN MIFID II HAVE ADOPTED REGIMES WHICH BAN, OR MAY LIMIT, THE PAYMENT OF COMMISSIONS AND OTHER INDUCEMENTS TO INTERMEDIARIES IN RELATION TO CERTAIN SALES TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS, AND SIMILAR REGIMES ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION IN SEVERAL OTHER JURISDICTIONS. DEPENDING ON THEIR EXACT TERMS, SUCH REGIMES MAY RESULT IN EXISTING FLOWS OF BUSINESS MOVING TO LESS PROFITABLE CHANNELS OR EVEN TO COMPETITORS PROVIDING SUBSTITUTABLE PRODUCTS OUTSIDE THE REGIME. ARRANGEMENTS WITH NON-INDEPENDENT ADVISERS WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED AS NARROWER RULES RELATED TO THE REQUIREMENT THAT COMMISSIONS REFLECT AN ENHANCEMENT OF THE SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS COME INTO EFFECT, ALONG WITH A PRESCRIPTIVE LIST OF PERMISSIBLE NON-MONETARY BENEFITS. THE INTERPRETATION OF THE INDUCEMENTS RULES HAS ALSO RESULTED IN MAJOR CHANGES TO HOW FUND MANAGERS FINANCE INVESTMENT RESEARCH WITH MANY FIRMS, INCLUDING OURS, OPTING TO PAY FOR THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENT RESEARCH FOR CLIENT ACCOUNTS COVERED BY MIFID II. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE THIRD-PARTY BROKER-DEALERS, BANKS, INVESTMENT ADVISERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES THAT CURRENTLY DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS, OR CONTINUE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER ALL OR SOME OF OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS THROUGH THEM. A FAILURE TO MAINTAIN STRONG BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUCH DISTRIBUTORS MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR DISTRIBUTION AND SALES OPERATIONS. BECAUSE WE USE BROKER-DEALERS, BANKS, INVESTMENT ADVISERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS, WE DO NOT CONTROL THE ULTIMATE INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATIONS GIVEN TO CLIENTS. ANY INABILITY TO ACCESS AND SUCCESSFULLY SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO CLIENTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR LEVEL OF AUM, INCOME AND OVERALL BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  OUR INCREASING FOCUS ON INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AS A SOURCE OF INVESTMENTS AND SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS SUBJECTS US TO INCREASED EXCHANGE RATE AND MARKET-SPECIFIC POLITICAL, ECONOMIC OR OTHER RISKS THAT MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND INCOME GENERATED OVERSEAS.  WHILE WE MAINTAIN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., WE ALSO PROVIDE SERVICES AND EARN REVENUES IN EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA, ASIA-PACIFIC, CANADA, THE BAHAMAS AND LATIN AMERICA. AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK THROUGH OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EXCHANGE RATES TO THE U.S. DOLLAR HAVE AFFECTED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM ONE PERIOD TO THE NEXT. WHILE WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, FOR EXAMPLE, BY DENOMINATING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR TRANSACTIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS, THE SITUATION MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE AS OUR BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW OUTSIDE THE U.S. APPRECIATION OF THE U.S. DOLLAR HAS AND COULD IN THE FUTURE MODERATE REVENUES FROM MANAGING OUR PRODUCTS INTERNATIONALLY, OR COULD AFFECT RELATIVE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS INVESTED IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE REVALUATION OF U.S. DOLLAR BALANCES HELD BY CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES FOR WHICH THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. SEPARATELY, MANAGEMENT FEES THAT WE EARN TEND TO BE HIGHER IN CONNECTION WITH NON-U.S. AUM THAN WITH U.S. AUM. CONSEQUENTLY, DOWNTURNS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE IN THE PAST AND COULD IN THE FUTURE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND INCOME. MOREOVER, OUR EMERGING MARKET PORTFOLIOS AND REVENUES DERIVED FROM MANAGING THESE PORTFOLIOS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF LOSS FROM FINANCIAL,  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC DEVELOPMENTS, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, SOCIAL INSTABILITY, CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, EXPROPRIATION, NATIONALIZATION, ASSET CONFISCATION AND CHANGES IN LEGISLATION RELATED TO NON-U.S. OWNERSHIP. INTERNATIONAL TRADING MARKETS, PARTICULARLY IN SOME EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES, ARE OFTEN SMALLER, LESS LIQUID, LESS REGULATED AND SIGNIFICANTLY MORE VOLATILE THAN THOSE IN THE U.S. AS OUR BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW IN NON-U.S. MARKETS, ANY ONGOING AND FUTURE BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL OR SOCIAL UNREST AFFECTING THESE MARKETS, IN ADDITION TO ANY DIRECT CONSEQUENCES SUCH UNREST MAY HAVE ON OUR PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES LOCATED IN THE AFFECTED AREA, MAY ALSO HAVE A MORE LASTING IMPACT ON THE LONG-TERM INVESTMENT CLIMATE IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS AND, AS A RESULT, OUR AUM AND THE CORRESPONDING REVENUES AND INCOME THAT WE GENERATE FROM THEM MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.  HARM TO OUR REPUTATION OR POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE THE LEVEL OF OUR AUM OR AFFECT OUR SALES, AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND INCOME.  OUR REPUTATION IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR BRAND NAMES HAVE BEEN, AND CONTINUE TO BE, WELL RECEIVED BOTH IN OUR INDUSTRY AND WITH OUR CLIENTS, REFLECTING THE FACT THAT OUR BRANDS, LIKE OUR BUSINESS, ARE BASED IN PART ON TRUST AND CONFIDENCE. IF OUR REPUTATION IS HARMED, EXISTING CLIENTS MAY REDUCE AMOUNTS HELD IN, OR WITHDRAW ENTIRELY FROM, OUR PRODUCTS OR OUR PRODUCTS MAY TERMINATE THEIR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH US, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF OUR AUM AND CAUSE US TO SUFFER A CORRESPONDING LOSS IN OUR REVENUES AND INCOME. OUR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, ALONG WITH ACHIEVING AND MAINTAINING SUPERIOR DISTRIBUTION AND CLIENT SERVICE, IS ALSO CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS. STRONG INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OFTEN STIMULATES SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS. POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE AS COMPARED TO THIRD-PARTY BENCHMARKS OR COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS HAS IN THE PAST AND COULD IN THE FUTURE LEAD TO A DECREASE IN SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND STIMULATE REDEMPTIONS FROM EXISTING PRODUCTS, GENERALLY LOWERING THE OVERALL LEVEL OF AUM AND REDUCING THE MANAGEMENT FEES WE EARN. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT PAST OR PRESENT INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE IN OUR PRODUCTS WILL BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE. ANY POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND INCOME. REPUTATIONAL HARM OR POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE MAY CAUSE US TO LOSE CURRENT CLIENTS AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS OR DEVELOP NEW BUSINESS. IF WE FAIL TO ADDRESS, OR APPEAR TO FAIL TO ADDRESS, SUCCESSFULLY AND PROMPTLY THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF ANY REPUTATIONAL HARM OR POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, WE MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN REPAIRING ANY EXISTING HARM TO OUR REPUTATION OR PERFORMANCE AND OUR FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS WOULD LIKELY BE AFFECTED.  OUR FUTURE RESULTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON MAINTAINING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF EXPENSES, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION.  THE LEVEL OF OUR EXPENSES IS SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION AND MAY INCREASE FOR THE FOLLOWING OR OTHER REASONS: CHANGES IN THE LEVEL AND SCOPE OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES IN RESPONSE TO MARKET CONDITIONS OR REGULATIONS; VARIATIONS IN THE LEVEL OF TOTAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BONUSES, MERIT INCREASES AND SEVERANCE COSTS, CHANGES IN OUR EMPLOYEE COUNT AND MIX, AND COMPETITIVE FACTORS; AND/OR CHANGES IN EXPENSES AND CAPITAL COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS INCURRED TO MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE OUR ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATING SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE OR TO COVER UNINSURED LOSSES, AND AN INCREASE IN INSURANCE EXPENSES INCLUDING THROUGH THE ASSUMPTION OF HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES AND/OR CO-INSURANCE LIABILITY.  OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE AND GROW OUR BUSINESS CAN BE IMPEDED BY SYSTEMS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS.  OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS IN EFFECTIVELY MANAGING AND GROWING OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO INTEGRATE THE VARIED ACCOUNTING, FINANCIAL, INFORMATION, AND OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS ON A GLOBAL BASIS. MOREOVER, ADAPTING OR DEVELOPING THE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS WE USE TO MEET OUR INTERNAL NEEDS, AS WELL AS CLIENT NEEDS, INDUSTRY DEMANDS AND NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, IS ALSO CRITICAL FOR OUR BUSINESS. THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES PRESENTS NEW CHALLENGES TO US. WE HAVE AN ONGOING NEED TO CONTINUALLY UPGRADE AND IMPROVE OUR VARIOUS TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING OUR DATA PROCESSING, FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, SHAREHOLDER SERVICING AND TRADING SYSTEMS. FURTHER, WE ALSO MUST BE PROACTIVE AND PREPARED TO IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS WHEN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES PRESENT THEMSELVES, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF A BUSINESS ACQUISITION OR RAPIDLY INCREASING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN PARTICULAR MARKETS OR REGIONS. THESE NEEDS COULD PRESENT OPERATIONAL ISSUES OR REQUIRE, FROM TIME TO TIME, SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL SPENDING. IT ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO REEVALUATE THE CURRENT VALUE AND/OR EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES OF THE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS WE USE, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  OUR INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RECOVER SHOULD WE EXPERIENCE A DISASTER OR OTHER BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROBLEM COULD CAUSE MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSS, LOSS OF HUMAN CAPITAL, REGULATORY ACTIONS, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR LEGAL LIABILITY.  SHOULD WE EXPERIENCE A LOCAL OR REGIONAL DISASTER OR OTHER BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROBLEM, SUCH AS AN EARTHQUAKE, TSUNAMI, TERRORIST ATTACK, PANDEMIC OR OTHER NATURAL OR MAN-MADE DISASTER, OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE SAFETY AND AVAILABILITY OF OUR PERSONNEL, OUR OFFICE FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF OUR TECHNOLOGY, COMPUTER, TELECOMMUNICATION AND OTHER SYSTEMS AND OPERATIONS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS. WHILE OUR OPERATIONAL SIZE, THE DIVERSITY OF LOCATIONS FROM WHICH WE OPERATE, AND OUR VARIOUS BACK-UP SYSTEMS PROVIDE US WITH AN ADVANTAGE SHOULD WE EXPERIENCE A LOCAL OR REGIONAL DISASTER OR OTHER BUSINESS CONTINUITY EVENT, WE COULD STILL EXPERIENCE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES, IN PARTICULAR DEPENDING UPON HOW A LOCAL OR REGIONAL EVENT MAY AFFECT OUR HUMAN CAPITAL ACROSS OUR OPERATIONS OR WITH REGARD TO PARTICULAR ASPECTS OF OUR OPERATIONS, SUCH AS KEY EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OR PERSONNEL IN OUR TECHNOLOGY GROUP. MOREOVER, AS WE GROW OUR OPERATIONS IN NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, THE POTENTIAL FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF NATURAL OR MAN-MADE DISASTERS; POLITICAL, ECONOMIC OR INFRASTRUCTURE INSTABILITIES; INFORMATION, TECHNOLOGY OR SECURITY LIMITATIONS OR BREACHES; OR OTHER COUNTRY- OR REGION-SPECIFIC BUSINESS CONTINUITY RISKS INCREASES. PAST DISASTER RECOVERY EFFORTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT EVEN SEEMINGLY LOCALIZED EVENTS MAY REQUIRE BROADER DISASTER RECOVERY EFFORTS THROUGHOUT OUR OPERATIONS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, WE REGULARLY ASSESS AND TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE UPON OUR EXISTING BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS AND KEY MANAGEMENT SUCCESSION. HOWEVER,  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  A DISASTER ON A SIGNIFICANT SCALE OR AFFECTING CERTAIN OF OUR KEY OPERATING AREAS WITHIN OR ACROSS REGIONS, OR OUR INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RECOVER SHOULD WE EXPERIENCE A DISASTER OR OTHER BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROBLEM, COULD MATERIALLY INTERRUPT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND CAUSE MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSS, LOSS OF HUMAN CAPITAL, REGULATORY ACTIONS, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR LEGAL LIABILITY.  REGULATORY AND GOVERNMENTAL EXAMINATIONS AND/OR INVESTIGATIONS, LITIGATION AND THE LEGAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AUM, INCREASE COSTS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY AND/OR OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.  FROM TIME TO TIME WE RECEIVE AND RESPOND TO GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY REQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS OR OTHER INFORMATION, SUBPOENAS, EXAMINATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY EXAMINATIONS OR INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN INACTIVE COULD BECOME ACTIVE. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ARE NAMED AS A PARTY IN LITIGATION. WE MAY BE OBLIGATED, AND UNDER OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, BY-LAWS AND STANDARD FORM OF DIRECTOR INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT WE ARE OBLIGATED UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, OR WE MAY CHOOSE, TO INDEMNIFY DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES AGAINST LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES THEY MAY INCUR IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH MATTERS TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. EVEN IF CLAIMS MADE AGAINST US ARE WITHOUT MERIT, LITIGATION TYPICALLY IS AN EXPENSIVE PROCESS. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LEGAL LIABILITY OFTEN ARE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS OR QUANTIFY AND THEIR EXISTENCE AND MAGNITUDE CAN REMAIN UNKNOWN FOR SIGNIFICANT PERIODS OF TIME. EVENTUAL EXPOSURES FROM AND EXPENSES INCURRED RELATING TO ANY LITIGATION, INVESTIGATIONS, EXAMINATIONS AND SETTLEMENTS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AUM, INCREASE COSTS AND/OR NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. ALLEGATIONS, FINDINGS OR JUDGMENTS OF WRONGDOING BY REGULATORY OR GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES OR IN LITIGATION AGAINST US, OR SETTLEMENTS WITH RESPECT THERETO, COULD AFFECT OUR REPUTATION, INCREASE OUR COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS AND/OR NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  OUR ABILITY TO MEET CASH NEEDS DEPENDS UPON CERTAIN FACTORS, INCLUDING THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR ASSETS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND OUR PERCEIVED CREDITWORTHINESS.  OUR ABILITY TO MEET ANTICIPATED CASH NEEDS DEPENDS UPON FACTORS SUCH AS THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR ASSETS, OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND OUR CREDITWORTHINESS AS PERCEIVED BY LENDERS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN CASH, FINANCING OR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS IN A TIMELY MANNER, WE MAY BE FORCED TO INCUR UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR REVISE OUR BUSINESS PLANS, AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. FURTHER, OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR CREDIT RATINGS. A REDUCTION IN OUR LONG- OR SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATINGS COULD INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS AND LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS. VOLATILITY IN THE GLOBAL FINANCING MARKETS MAY ALSO IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS SHOULD WE SEEK TO DO SO, AND MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON INVESTORS\u2019 WILLINGNESS TO PURCHASE OUR SECURITIES, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT SPREADS AND/OR THE VALUATION LEVELS OF EQUITY MARKETS.  WE ARE DEPENDENT ON THE EARNINGS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.  SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH OUR SUBSIDIARIES. AS A RESULT, OUR CASH FLOW AND OUR ABILITY TO FUND OPERATIONS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE EARNINGS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF EARNINGS, LOANS OR OTHER PAYMENTS BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES. OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT LEGAL ENTITIES AND HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO FUND OUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, WHETHER BY DIVIDENDS, DISTRIBUTIONS, LOANS OR OTHER PAYMENTS. ANY PAYMENTS TO US BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES COULD BE SUBJECT TO STATUTORY OR CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS AND ARE CONTINGENT UPON OUR SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 EARNINGS AND BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS. CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS WHICH MAY LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO TRANSFER ASSETS TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE UNABLE TO DISTRIBUTE ASSETS TO US.", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "FRANKLIN RESOURCES INC", "CIK": 38777, "Date": "2019-01-30T00:00:00", "Ticker": "BEN", "Name": "Franklin Resources Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 6282.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 132670991.0, "key": "20190130BEN", "labelr1": 1.7875558611206586, "labelr2": 0.06754474839581079, "labelr3": 1.5862301721228564, "labelr4": 1.3621262458471763, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5509521, "prof1": 0.44904792, "return1&2": 0.9814610679059236, "return1&2&3": 0.9658928363191606, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9527361564888996, "return2": 0.999324552516042, "return1": 0.9821244413887934, "return3": 0.9841376982787714, "return4": 0.9863787375415284, "1_day_return": 1.7875558611206488, "cumulative_return1": 1.3389094242410056, "cumulative_return1&2": 1.379736871131241, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.7247754973097028, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.9654986160375304, "indexx": 40, "returnpred": -1.7875558611206586, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.014948571939841, "cumreturn1b": 1.073049490521307, "cumreturn1c": 0.8675281179756151, "cumreturndow": 1.1046657391464625, "cumreturnsp500": 1.101975963704438}, {"Unnamed: 0": 49, "level_0": 51, "index": 27484, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR CURRENT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCES, INVESTMENTS AND CASH EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED BY FUTURE OPERATIONS ARE OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE SOURCES, ALONG WITH OUR BORROWING CAPACITY, ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND FUTURE GROWTH AND EXPANSION. SEE NOTE 11 TO THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES.  THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $.50 PER SHARE OF ITS COMMON STOCK PAYABLE ON JANUARY 4, 2019, TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON DECEMBER 18, 2018.  IN OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2018, WE PURCHASED AND RETIRED 20,604 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A COST OF $2,794,027. IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 WE DID NOT PURCHASE AND RETIRE ANY SHARES. ON AUGUST 4, 2017 THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE PURCHASE AND RETIREMENT OF 500,000 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK; 384,506 SHARES REMAIN TO BE PURCHASED UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION.  FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUATION OF THE MEXICAN AND CANADIAN CURRENCIES AND THE RESULTING TRANSLATION OF THE NET ASSETS OF OUR MEXICAN AND CANADIAN SUBSIDIARIES CAUSED AN INCREASE OF $1,359,000 IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS IN THE 2019 FIRST QUARTER AND AN INCREASE OF $3,887,000 ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS IN THE 2018 FIRST QUARTER.  OUR GENERAL-PURPOSE BANK CREDIT LINE WHICH EXPIRES IN NOVEMBER 2021 PROVIDES FOR UP TO A $50,000,000 REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE AGREEMENT CONTAINS RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND REQUIRES COMMITMENT FEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARD BANKING PRACTICE. THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING BALANCES UNDER THIS FACILITY AT DECEMBER 29, 2018.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NET SALES INCREASED $6,402,000 OR 2% TO $271,612,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2017.  FOOD SERVICE  SALES TO FOOD SERVICE CUSTOMERS INCREASED $5,626,000 OR 3% IN THE FIRST QUARTER TO $187,890,000. SOFT PRETZEL SALES TO THE FOOD SERVICE MARKET OF $48,991,000 WERE ROUGHLY THE SAME AS LAST YEAR. ALTHOUGH SALES TO RESTAURANT CHAINS AND SCHOOLS INCREASED, SALES TO MASS MERCHANDISING CHAINS AND WAREHOUSE CLUB STORES DECLINED.  FROZEN JUICES AND ICES SALES INCREASED 5% TO $7,527,000 IN THE THREE MONTHS WITH SALES INCREASES AND DECREASES ACROSS OUR CUSTOMER BASE.  CHURRO SALES TO FOOD SERVICE CUSTOMERS WERE UP 4% IN THE QUARTER TO $15,135,000 WITH SALES INCREASES AND DECREASES ACROSS OUR CUSTOMER BASE.  22  SALES OF BAKERY PRODUCTS INCREASED $7,176,000 OR 8% IN THE FIRST QUARTER TO $102,109,000 WITH SALES TO ONE CO-PACK CUSTOMER ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE SALES INCREASE AND INCREASED SALES TO WAREHOUSE CLUB STORES IN PART DUE TO A SPECIAL PROMOTION AND INCREASED SALES TO SCHOOLS ACCOUNTING FOR THE BALANCE.  SALES OF HANDHELDS DECREASED $2,560,000 OR 23 % IN THE QUARTER WITH THE DECREASE PRIMARILY COMING FROM LOWER SALES TO CO-PACK CUSTOMERS BECAUSE OF UNSUCCESSFUL PRODUCT LAUNCHES. SALES OF FUNNEL CAKE INCREASED $166,000 OR 3% IN THE QUARTER ALTHOUGH SALES TO SCHOOL FOOD SERVICE WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER THIS QUARTER.  SALES OF NEW PRODUCTS IN THE FIRST TWELVE MONTHS SINCE THEIR INTRODUCTION WERE APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION IN THIS QUARTER. PRICE INCREASES WERE APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER AND NET VOLUME INCREASES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY $2.5 MILLION OF SALES IN THE QUARTER.  OPERATING INCOME IN OUR FOOD SERVICE SEGMENT INCREASED FROM $15,900,000 TO $18,461,000 IN THE QUARTER PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF INCREASED BAKERY SALES, PRICE INCREASES AND IMPROVED OPERATIONS AT SEVERAL OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, ESPECIALLY AT OUR LABRIOLA PRODUCTION FACILITY, WHICH WAS RECENTLY ACQUIRED AT THIS TIME A YEAR AGO. ADDITIONALLY, LAST YEAR\u2019S QUARTER HAD THE BURDEN OF SHUTDOWN COSTS OF OUR CHAMBERSBURG, PA PRODUCTION FACILITY. HOWEVER, THIS YEAR\u2019S QUARTER WAS IMPACTED BY APPROXIMATELY $2.0 MILLION OF HIGHER DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER FREIGHT RATES WHICH INCREASED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELECTRONIC LOGGING DEVICE MANDATE IN JANUARY 2018. ADDITIONALLY, LOWER SALES OF OUR MARY B\u2019S BISCUITS AND RELATED COSTS DUE TO OUR RECALL IN JANUARY 2018 IMPACTED OUR OPERATING INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $500,000 IN THE QUARTER.  RETAIL SUPERMARKETS  SALES OF PRODUCTS TO RETAIL SUPERMARKETS INCREASED $339,000 OR 1% TO $23,415,000 IN THE FIRST QUARTER.  SOFT PRETZEL SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER WERE DOWN 3% TO $10,186,000. SALES OF FROZEN JUICES AND ICES INCREASED $1,269,000 OR 13% TO $10,996,000 IN THE FIRST QUARTER DUE TO INCREASED CUSTOMER PROMOTIONAL SUPPORT . HANDHELD SALES TO RETAIL SUPERMARKET CUSTOMERS DECREASED 15% TO $2,568,000 IN THE QUARTER AS THE SALES OF THIS PRODUCT LINE CONTINUE THEIR LONG TERM DECLINE.  SALES OF NEW PRODUCTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER WERE LESS THAN $400,000. PRICE INCREASES PROVIDED ABOUT $600,000 OF SALES IN THE QUARTER AND NET VOLUME DECREASED BY ABOUT $300,000.  OPERATING INCOME IN OUR RETAIL SUPERMARKETS SEGMENT WAS $1,447,000 IN THIS YEAR\u2019S FIRST QUARTER COMPARED TO $2,558,000 IN LAST YEAR\u2019S QUARTER, A 43% DECREASE. INCREASED PRODUCT AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS ALONG WITH JUST A MODEST SALES INCREASE WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME.  23  FROZEN BEVERAGES  FROZEN BEVERAGE AND RELATED PRODUCT SALES INCREASED 1% TO $60,307,000 IN THE FIRST QUARTER. BEVERAGE RELATED SALES WERE DOWN 5% TO $31,436,000, PRIMARILY BECAUSE SALES WERE UP A VERY STRONG 21% LAST YEAR COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. GALLON SALES WERE DOWN 1% FOR THE THREE MONTHS WITH LOWER SALES ACROSS OUR CUSTOMER BASE. SERVICE REVENUE INCREASED 4% TO $19,743,000 IN THE FIRST QUARTER WITH SALES INCREASES AND DECREASES SPREAD THROUGHOUT OUR CUSTOMER BASE.  MACHINES REVENUE (PRIMARILY SALES OF FROZEN BEVERAGE MACHINES) WERE $8,904,000, AN INCREASE OF 19%. OPERATING INCOME IN OUR FROZEN BEVERAGE SEGMENT DECREASED TO $2,174,000 IN THIS QUARTER COMPARED TO $2,770,000 LAST YEAR AS A RESULT OF LOWER BEVERAGE SALES AND GENERALLY HIGHER COSTS.  CONSOLIDATED  GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES WAS 28.30% IN THE THREE MONTH PERIOD THIS YEAR AND 27.63% LAST YEAR.  GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE INCREASED BECAUSE OF IMPROVED OPERATIONS AT SEVERAL OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, ESPECIALLY AT OUR LABRIOLA PRODUCTION FACILITY, PRICE INCREASES AND BECAUSE LAST YEAR HAD THE BURDEN OF SHUTTING DOWN OUR CHAMBERSBURG, PA PRODUCTION FACILITY AND MOVING ITS PRODUCTION TO OTHER FACILITIES.  TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED $2,730,000 IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES INCREASED TO 20.2% FROM 19.6% LAST YEAR. MARKETING EXPENSES DECREASED TO 7.89% OF SALES IN THIS YEAR\u2019S QUARTER FROM 8.14% LAST YEAR PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF REDUCED SPENDING IN OUR FROZEN BEVERAGES SEGMENT. DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES WERE 8.82% OF SALES IN THIS YEAR\u2019S QUARTER AND 7.98% OF SALES IN LAST YEAR\u2019S QUARTER PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF INCREASED FREIGHT RATES WHICH INCREASED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELECTRONIC LOGGING DEVICE MANDATE IN JANUARY 2018. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE 3.40% OF SALES THIS QUARTER COMPARED TO 3.53% OF SALES LAST YEAR IN THE FIRST QUARTER.  OPERATING INCOME INCREASED $854,000 OR 4% TO $22,082,000 IN THE FIRST QUARTER AS A RESULT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED ITEMS.  INVESTMENT INCOME DECREASED BY $449,000 IN THE FIRST QUARTER BECAUSE OF RECOGNIZED UNREALIZED LOSSES OF $1,027,000 WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST INCOME OF $585,000.  OTHER INCOME IN LAST YEAR\u2019S QUARTER INCLUDES A $520,000 GAIN ON A SALE OF PROPERTY.  NET EARNINGS DECREASED $18,723,000, OR 52%, IN THE CURRENT THREE MONTH PERIOD TO $17,526,000. NET EARNINGS FOR LAST YEAR\u2019S QUARTER BENEFITED FROM A $20.9 MILLION, OR $1.11 PER DILUTED SHARE, GAIN ON THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $1.2 MILLION, OR $.06 PER DILUTED SHARE, PROVISION FOR THE ONE TIME REPATRIATION TAX, BOTH OF WHICH RESULTED FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ENACTED IN IN DECEMBER 2017.

AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION, PINNACLE BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY. PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, DATED AS OF JUNE 26, 2018 (THE \"MERGER AGREEMENT\"), AMONG CONAGRA BRANDS, PINNACLE, AND PATRIOT MERGER SUB INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CONAGRA BRANDS THAT CEASED TO EXIST AT THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER (\"MERGER SUB\"), EACH SHARE OF PINNACLE COMMON STOCK ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER WAS CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE (I) $43.11 PER SHARE IN CASH AND (II) 0.6494 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $5.00 PER SHARE, OF THE COMPANY (\"COMPANY SHARES\") (TOGETHER, THE \"MERGER CONSIDERATION\"), WITH CASH PAYABLE IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES OF COMPANY SHARES. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION PAID IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION WAS APPROXIMATELY $8.03 BILLION AND CONSISTED OF: (1) CASH OF $5.17 BILLION ($5.12 BILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED); (2) 77.5 MILLION OF COMPANY SHARES, WITH AN APPROXIMATE VALUE OF  $2.82 BILLION  , ISSUED OUT OF THE COMPANY'S TREASURY TO FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF PINNACLE; AND (3) REPLACEMENT AWARDS ISSUED TO FORMER PINNACLE EMPLOYEES REPRESENTING THE FAIR VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO PRE-COMBINATION SERVICE OF  $51.1 MILLION.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, WE INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $8.33 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND RECEIVED CASH PROCEEDS OF $575.0 MILLION ($555.9 MILLION NET OF RELATED FEES) FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK IN AN UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC OFFERING. WE USED SUCH PROCEEDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE CASH PORTION OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION, THE REPAYMENT OF PINNACLE DEBT ACQUIRED, THE REFINANCING OF CERTAIN CONAGRA BRANDS DEBT, AND THE PAYMENT OF RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES.  THE INTEGRATION OF PINNACLE IS UNDERWAY.  WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE COST SYNERGIES IN EXCESS OF $215 MILLION PER YEAR WHEN THE INTEGRATION IS CONCLUDED.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE 2017 U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \"TAX ACT\") WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE TAX ACT REDUCED TAX RATES AND MODIFIED CERTAIN POLICIES, CREDITS, AND DEDUCTIONS AND HAS CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL TAX CONSEQUENCES. THE TAX ACT REDUCED THE FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM A MAXIMUM OF 35% TO A FLAT 21% RATE. THE TAX ACT'S CORPORATE RATE REDUCTION BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. GIVEN OUR OFF-CALENDAR FISCAL YEAR-END, OUR FISCAL 2018 FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE WAS A BLENDED RATE. OUR FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE IS 21% IN FISCAL 2019.  IN THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF FISCAL  2019  , RESULTS REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN NET SALES, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF RECENT ACQUISITIONS, WITH ORGANIC (EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND DIVESTED BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS ACQUISITIONS UNTIL THE ANNIVERSARY DATE OF THE ACQUISITION) INCREASES IN OUR REFRIGERATED & FROZEN AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATING SEGMENTS, IN EACH CASE COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.

OVERALL SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PINNACLE ACQUISITION. THE INCREASE IN SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER CORPORATE EXPENSES, PRIMARILY IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF PINNACLE AND THE PINNACLE RESTRUCTURING PLAN, AND HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE, IN EACH CASE COMPARED TO THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF FISCAL  2018  . INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS LOWER COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF FISCAL  2019  WERE  $0.31  , INCLUDING EARNINGS OF  $0.32  PER DILUTED SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND A LOSS OF  $0.01  PER DILUTED SHARE FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

THE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED IN THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE REPORTING SEGMENTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION BEING ECONOMICALLY HEDGED IS INCLUDED IN EARNINGS. IN THE EVENT THAT MANAGEMENT DETERMINES A PARTICULAR DERIVATIVE ENTERED INTO AS AN ECONOMIC HEDGE OF A FORECASTED COMMODITY PURCHASE HAS CEASED TO FUNCTION AS AN ECONOMIC HEDGE, WE CEASE RECOGNIZING FURTHER GAINS AND LOSSES ON SUCH DERIVATIVES IN CORPORATE EXPENSE AND BEGIN RECOGNIZING SUCH GAINS AND LOSSES WITHIN SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS, IMMEDIATELY.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  OUR PRIMARY FINANCING OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN A PRUDENT CAPITAL STRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES US FLEXIBILITY TO PURSUE OUR GROWTH OBJECTIVES. IF NECESSARY, WE USE SHORT-TERM DEBT PRINCIPALLY TO FINANCE ONGOING OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OUR SEASONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL (ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, AND INVENTORIES, LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED PAYROLL, AND OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES), AND A COMBINATION OF EQUITY AND LONG-TERM DEBT TO FINANCE BOTH OUR BASE WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND OUR NON-CURRENT ASSETS. WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING AN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING.  AT  NOVEMBER 25, 2018  , WE HAD A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \"REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\") WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT PROVIDES FOR A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT ANY ONE TIME OF $1.6 BILLION (SUBJECT TO INCREASE TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $2.1 BILLION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE LENDERS). WE HAVE HISTORICALLY USED A CREDIT FACILITY PRINCIPALLY AS A BACK-UP FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. AS OF  NOVEMBER 25, 2018  , THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  AS OF  NOVEMBER 25, 2018  , WE HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF BORROWINGS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL  2019  WAS $408.7 MILLION. A  S OF  MAY 27, 2018  , WE HAD $277.0 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM.  ON OCTOBER 22, 2018, WE ISSUED SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES IN THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $7.025 BILLION. THESE NOTES WERE ISSUED IN SEVEN TRANCHES: FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE OCTOBER 22, 2020 IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $525.0 MILLION WITH AN INTEREST EQUAL TO THREE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 0.75%, 3.8% SENIOR NOTES DUE OCTOBER 22, 2021 IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $1.2 BILLION; 4.3% SENIOR NOTES DUE MAY 1, 2024 IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $1.0 BILLION; 4.6% SENIOR NOTES DUE NOVEMBER 1, 2025 IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $1.0 BILLION; 4.85% SENIOR NOTES DUE NOVEMBER 1, 2028 IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $1.3 BILLION; 5.3% SENIOR NOTES DUE NOVEMBER 1, 2038 IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $1.0 BILLION; AND 5.4% SENIOR NOTES DUE NOVEMBER 1, 2048 IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $1.0 BILLION.  ON OCTOBER 26, 2018, WE BORROWED $1.3 BILLION UNDER OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY. THE THREE-YEAR TRANCHE LOANS MATURE ON OCTOBER 26, 2021, AND THE FIVE-YEAR TRANCHE LOANS MATURE ON OCTOBER 26, 2023. THE TERM LOANS WILL BEAR INTEREST AT, AT THE COMPANY'S ELECTION, EITHER (A) LIBOR PLUS A PERCENTAGE SPREAD (RANGING FROM 1% TO 1.625% FOR THREE-YEAR TRANCHE LOANS AND 1.125% TO 1.75% FOR FIVE-YEAR TRANCHE  40  LOANS) BASED ON THE COMPANY'S SENIOR UNSECURED LONG-TERM INDEBTEDNESS RATINGS OR (B) THE ALTERNATE BASE RATE, DESCRIBED IN THE TERM LOAN FACILITY AS THE GREATEST OF (I) BANK OF AMERICA'S PRIME RATE, (II) THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE PLUS 0.50%, AND (III) ONE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 1.00%, PLUS A PERCENTAGE SPREAD (RANGING FROM 0% TO 0.625% FOR THREE-YEAR TRANCHE LOANS AND 0.125% TO 0.75% FOR FIVE-YEAR TRANCHE LOANS) BASED ON THE COMPANY'S SENIOR UNSECURED LONG-TERM INDEBTEDNESS RATINGS.  THE COMPANY MAY VOLUNTARILY PREPAY TERM LOANS UNDER THE TERM LOAN FACILITY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, WITHOUT PENALTY, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS. SUBSEQUENT TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE PREPAID $250.0 MILLION OF THE $1.30 BILLION BORROWINGS, CONSISTING OF $125.0 MILLION OF THE THREE-YEAR TRANCHE LOANS AND $125.0 MILLION OF THE FIVE-YEAR TRANCHE LOANS.  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE TERM LOAN FACILITY GENERALLY REQUIRE THAT OUR RATIO OF EBITDA (EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION) TO INTEREST EXPENSE NOT TO BE LESS THAN 3.0 TO 1.0 AND OUR RATIO OF FUNDED DEBT TO EBITDA NOT TO EXCEED CERTAIN DECREASING SPECIFIED LEVELS, RANGING FROM 5.875 THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 TO 3.75 FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2023 AND THEREAFTER. EACH RATIO IS TO BE CALCULATED ON A ROLLING FOUR-QUARTER BASIS. AS OF  NOVEMBER 25, 2018  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS.  AS OF THE END OF THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  , OUR SENIOR LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS WERE ALL INVESTMENT GRADE. A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS WOULD NOT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO BORROW AMOUNTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, ALTHOUGH BORROWING COSTS WOULD INCREASE. A DOWNGRADE OF OUR SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATINGS WOULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM BY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING BORROWING COSTS AND CAUSING SHORTER DURATIONS, AS WELL AS MAKING ACCESS TO COMMERCIAL PAPER MORE DIFFICULT.  ON OCTOBER 12, 2018, WE ISSUED APPROXIMATELY 16.3 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN AN UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC OFFERING FOR PROCEEDS OF $555.9 MILLION, NET OF RELATED FEES.  PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND COMMON STOCK IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WERE USED FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE CASH PORTION OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION, THE REPAYMENT OF PINNACLE DEBT ACQUIRED, THE REFINANCING OF CERTAIN CONAGRA BRANDS DEBT, AND THE PAYMENT OF RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES.  WE REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME AFTER CONSIDERING MARKET CONDITIONS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH REPURCHASE LIMITS AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD. UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION, WE MAY REPURCHASE OUR SHARES PERIODICALLY OVER SEVERAL YEARS, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, AND MAY DO SO IN OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE SUSPENDED SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY IN LIGHT OF THE THEN-PENDING ACQUISITION OF PINNACLE. THE COMPANY PLANS TO REPURCHASE SHARES UNDER ITS AUTHORIZED PROGRAM ONLY AT TIMES AND IN AMOUNTS AS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIORITIZATION OF ACHIEVING ITS LEVERAGE TARGETS. THE COMPANY'S TOTAL REMAINING SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION AS OF  NOVEMBER 25, 2018  WAS $1.41 BILLION.  ON NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE COMPANY PAID A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PAYMENT OF $0.2125 PER SHARE TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON OCTOBER 17, 2018.  ON DECEMBER 6, 2019, THE BOARD ANNOUNCED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PAYMENT OF $0.2125 PER SHARE, TO BE PAID ON MARCH 1, 2019, TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON JANUARY 30, 2019. SUBJECT TO MARKET AND OTHER CONDITIONS AND THE APPROVAL OF OUR BOARD, WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN OUR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AT THE CURRENT ANNUAL RATE OF $0.85 PER SHARE DURING FISCAL 2019. IN THE FUTURE, WE EXPECT MODEST DIVIDEND INCREASES WHILE WE FOCUS ON DE-LEVERAGING, SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF OUR BOARD.  ON DECEMBER 18, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT HAD ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO DIVEST THE  WESSON  \u00ae  OIL BUSINESS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE TRANSACTION TO CLOSE BEFORE THE END OF FISCAL 2019, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE RECEIPT OF REGULATORY APPROVAL. WE EXPECT TO REALIZE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF APPROXIMATELY $180.0 MILLION.  WE HAVE ACCESS TO OUR $1.6 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS. WE BELIEVE WE ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL BANK LOAN FACILITIES, IF NEEDED.  WE EXPECT TO MAINTAIN OR HAVE ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO RETIRE OR REFINANCE LONG-TERM DEBT UPON MATURITY, AS MARKET CONDITIONS WARRANT, FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS, OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, PROCEEDS FROM ANY DIVESTITURES AND OTHER DISPOSITION TRANSACTIONS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, AND OUR $1.6 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  CASH FLOWS  DURING THE  FIRST HALF  OF FISCAL  2019  , WE GENERATED  $314.3 MILLION  OF CASH, WHICH WAS THE NET RESULT OF $261.9 MILLION  GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, $5.20 BILLION  USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES, $5.26 BILLION  PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES, AND A DECREASE OF  $1.8 MILLION  DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS TOTALED $250.7 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST HALF  OF FISCAL  2019  , AS COMPARED TO $404.7 MILLION  GENERATED IN THE  FIRST HALF  OF FISCAL  2018  . THE DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PINNACLE ACQUISITION, CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, IN PART DRIVEN BY A SHIFT IN THE TIMING OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CASH  41  COLLECTIONS, AND INCREASED INTEREST PAYMENTS, INCLUDING AMOUNTS ACCRUED BY PINNACLE PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH PROCEEDS RECEIVED UPON THE SETTLEMENT OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS, A DECREASE IN TAX PAYMENTS, AND AN INCREASE IN DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM OUR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $5.20 BILLION  AND  $366.1 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST HALF  OF FISCAL  2019  AND FISCAL  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE  FIRST HALF  OF FISCAL  2019  CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF THE PURCHASE OF PINNACLE FOR  $5.12 BILLION  , NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALING $133.3 MILLION  AND THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF OUR  DEL MONTE  \u00ae  PROCESSED FRUIT AND VEGETABLE BUSINESS IN CANADA TOTALING  $32.2 MILLION  . INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE  FIRST HALF  OF FISCAL  2018  CONSISTED MAINLY OF THE PURCHASE OF ANGIE'S ARTISAN TREATS, LLC FOR  $249.6 MILLION  , NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALING  $123.4 MILLION.  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES TOTALED  $5.26 BILLION  IN THE  FIRST HALF  OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO CASH USED OF  $230.5 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST HALF  OF FISCAL  2018  . IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2019, IN CONNECTION WITH THE PINNACLE ACQUISITION, WE ISSUED LONG-TERM DEBT THAT GENERATED  $8.31 BILLION  IN GROSS PROCEEDS AND ISSUED COMMON STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF  $555.9 MILLION  . THIS WAS REDUCED BY DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS AND BRIDGE FINANCING FEES TOTALING  $87.0 MILLION  . WE REPAID  $3.06 BILLION  OF LONG-TERM DEBT, REDUCED OUR SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM BY  $277.4 MILLION  , AND PAID CASH DIVIDENDS OF  $166.3 MILLION  . FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2018 CONSISTED PRINCIPALLY OF COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES TOTALING $580.0 MILLION, NET PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT TOTALING $497.4 MILLION, CASH DIVIDENDS PAID OF $171.6 MILLION, AND NET SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS OF $38.9 MILLION.  THE COMPANY HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $442.3 MILLION  AT  NOVEMBER 25, 2018  AND  $128.0 MILLION  AT  MAY 27, 2018  , OF WHICH  $92.8 MILLION  AT  NOVEMBER 25, 2018  AND  $121.6 MILLION  AT  MAY 27, 2018  WAS HELD IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY REPATRIATED  $91.2 MILLION  OF CASH BALANCES, OF WHICH $13.7 MILLION WAS PREVIOUSLY DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. WE HAVE PROVIDED DEFERRED TAXES OF $1.0 MILLION ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT NO LONGER MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT UNDER APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE REMAINING UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED AND THEREFORE HAVE NOT PROVIDED ANY ADDITIONAL DEFERRED TAXES.  OUR ESTIMATE OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL  2019  IS APPROXIMATELY $450.0 MILLION, INCLUDING AMOUNTS RELATED TO PINNACLE. FOR THE  FIRST HALF  OF FISCAL  2019  , WE HAVE FUNDED  $133.3 MILLION  OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT EXISTING CASH BALANCES, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES, AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR REPAYMENT OF DEBT, INCLUDING ANY REPAYMENT OF DEBT OR REFINANCING OF DEBT, WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND PAYMENT OF ANTICIPATED QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE USE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS (E.G., LEASES ACCOUNTED FOR AS OPERATING LEASES) WHERE SOUND BUSINESS PRINCIPLES WARRANT THEIR USE. WE ALSO PERIODICALLY ENTER INTO GUARANTEES AND OTHER SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS AS PART OF TRANSACTIONS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THESE ARE DESCRIBED FURTHER IN  \"OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\"  BELOW.  VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES NOT CONSOLIDATED  WE LEASE A CERTAIN OFFICE BUILDING FROM AN ENTITY THAT WE HAVE DETERMINED TO BE A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY. THE LEASE AGREEMENT WITH THIS ENTITY INCLUDES A FIXED-PRICE PURCHASE OPTION FOR THE ASSET BEING LEASED. THE LEASE AGREEMENT ALSO CONTAINS A CONTINGENT PUT OPTION (THE \"LEASE PUT OPTION\") THAT ALLOWS THE LESSOR TO REQUIRE US TO PURCHASE THE BUILDING AT THE GREATER OF ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION COST, OR FAIR MARKET VALUE, WITHOUT A LEASE AGREEMENT IN PLACE (THE \"PUT PRICE\") IN CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. AS A RESULT OF SUBSTANTIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO OUR DIVESTED PRIVATE BRANDS OPERATIONS, THIS LEASE PUT OPTION BECAME EXERCISABLE. WE ARE AMORTIZING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PUT PRICE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE (WITHOUT A LEASE AGREEMENT IN PLACE) OF THE PROPERTY OVER THE REMAINING LEASE TERM WITHIN SG&A EXPENSES. AS OF  NOVEMBER 25, 2018  AND MAY 27, 2018, THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT BY WHICH THE PUT OPTION PRICE EXCEEDED THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTY WAS  $8.2 MILLION  , OF WHICH WE HAD ACCRUED  $1.4 MILLION  AND $1.2 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. THIS LEASE IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN OPERATING LEASE, AND ACCORDINGLY, THERE ARE NO MATERIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OTHER THAN THE ACCRUED PORTION OF THE PUT PRICE, ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ENTITY INCLUDED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THIS ENTITY. IN MAKING THIS DETERMINATION, WE HAVE CONSIDERED, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, THE TERMS OF THE LEASE AGREEMENT, THE EXPECTED REMAINING USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET LEASED, AND THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE LESSOR ENTITY.  42  OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  AS PART OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS, WE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS THAT OBLIGATE US TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER CONTRACTS SUCH AS LEASE AGREEMENTS, DEBT AGREEMENTS, AND UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS (I.E., OBLIGATIONS TO TRANSFER FUNDS IN THE FUTURE FOR FIXED OR MINIMUM QUANTITIES OF GOODS OR SERVICES AT FIXED OR MINIMUM PRICES, SUCH AS \"TAKE-OR-PAY\" CONTRACTS).

UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, LAMB WESTON IS REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS FOR WAREHOUSE SERVICES BASED ON THE QUANTITY OF GOODS STORED AND OTHER SERVICE FACTORS. WE HAVE GUARANTEED THE WAREHOUSE PROVIDER THAT WE WILL MAKE THE PAYMENTS REQUIRED UNDER THE AGREEMENT IN THE EVENT THAT LAMB WESTON FAILS TO PERFORM. MINIMUM PAYMENTS OF  $1.5 MILLION  PER MONTH ARE REQUIRED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. UPON COMPLETION OF THE SPINOFF, WE RECOGNIZED A LIABILITY FOR THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THIS GUARANTEE. AS OF  NOVEMBER 25, 2018  , THE AMOUNT OF THIS GUARANTEE, RECORDED IN OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES, WAS  $27.3 MILLION.  LAMB WESTON IS A PARTY TO AN AGRICULTURAL SUBLEASE AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD PARTY FOR CERTAIN FARMLAND THROUGH 2020 (SUBJECT, AT LAMB WESTON'S OPTION, TO EXTENSION FOR TWO ADDITIONAL FIVE-YEAR PERIODS). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SUBLEASE AGREEMENT, LAMB WESTON IS REQUIRED TO MAKE CERTAIN RENTAL PAYMENTS TO THE SUBLESSOR. WE HAVE GUARANTEED THE SUBLESSOR LAMB WESTON'S PERFORMANCE AND THE PAYMENT OF ALL AMOUNTS (INCLUDING INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS) OWED BY LAMB WESTON UNDER THE SUBLEASE AGREEMENT, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF  $75.0 MILLION  . WE BELIEVE THE FARMLAND ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SUBLEASE AGREEMENT IS READILY MARKETABLE FOR LEASE TO OTHER AREA FARMING OPERATORS. AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE THAT ANY FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO THE COMPANY, IN THE EVENT THAT WE WERE REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THE GUARANTY, WOULD BE LARGELY MITIGATED.  THE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS TABLES ABOVE DO NOT INCLUDE ANY RESERVES FOR UNCERTAINTIES IN INCOME TAXES, AS WE ARE UNABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OR TIMING OF SETTLEMENT OF OUR RESERVES FOR INCOME TAXES. THE LIABILITY FOR GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT  NOVEMBER 25, 2018  WAS  $47.9 MILLION  . THE NET AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT  NOVEMBER 25, 2018  , THAT, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  $42.4 MILLION  . RECOGNITION OF THESE TAX BENEFITS WOULD HAVE A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

ADOPTION OF REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD  ON MARCH 1, 2018, WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\"ASU\") NO. 2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606)  AND THE RELATED AMENDMENTS (\"ASC 606\") USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD APPLIED TO THOSE CONTRACTS WHICH WERE NOT COMPLETED AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2018. RESULTS FOR OPERATING PERIODS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER MARCH 1, 2018 ARE PRESENTED UNDER ASC 606, WHILE PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS HAVE NOT BEEN ADJUSTED AND CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN EFFECT FOR THOSE PERIODS. HOWEVER, FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE IMPACT OF APPLYING ASC 606 AS OPPOSED TO APPLYING LEGACY ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE DID NOT RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO REPORTED REVENUES OR COSTS OF REVENUES. ACCORDINGLY, NO RECONCILIATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO SHOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN APPLYING ASC 606 AND LEGACY GUIDANCE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS NO CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS ON MARCH 1, 2018 RELATED TO THE ADOPTION. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED HEREIN FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY RESULTING FROM THE ADOPTION OF ASC 606.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  WE HAVE TWO DISTINCT OPERATING SEGMENTS, THE ENERGY SEGMENT AND THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT, AS DEFINED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  . MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE MOST MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS TO ANALYZE OUR PERFORMANCE BY SEGMENT. WE USE REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT TO EVALUATE OUR SEGMENTS. SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME CONSISTS OF NET SALES LESS COST OF SALES AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIABLE TO A SEGMENT. FOR A RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME TO CONSOLIDATED  OPERATING INCOME, SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR QUARTERLY CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ORDERS AND BACKLOG  OUR ENTIRE BACKLOG RELATES TO OUR ENERGY SEGMENT AND WAS  $307.8 MILLION  AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , AN INCREASE OF  $42.4 MILLION  , OR  16.0%  , AS COMPARED TO  $265.4 MILLION  AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  . OUR BACKLOG INCREASED  $24.6 MILLION  , OR  8.7%  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. BOTH OF THESE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF SEVERAL LARGE INTERNATIONAL ORDERS, HIGHER OVERALL ACTIVITY WITHIN THE ENERGY SEGMENT AND INCREMENTAL BUSINESS GENERATED FROM OUR ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED DURING THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , OUR BOOK-TO-REVENUE RATIO INCREASED SLIGHTLY TO  0.88  TO 1 FROM  0.86  TO 1 WHEN COMPARED TO SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL  2018  AND OUR INCOMING NET ORDERS INCREASED BY  $31.5 MILLION  , OR  17.5%.

THESE  INCREASES  IN REVENUES WERE CAUSED BY SEVERAL POSITIVE FACTORS INCLUDING IMPROVED TURNAROUNDS IN THE U.S. REFINERY MARKET, INCREASED INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS AND AN UPTICK IN OUR ELECTRICAL BUSINESS. THESE  INCREASES  WERE ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREMENTAL REVENUES FROM OUR ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED DURING THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS AND WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTINUED SOFTNESS IN THE NUCLEAR MARKET, WHICH IS DUE IN PART TO THE WESTINGHOUSE BANKRUPTCY DISCUSSED BELOW.  REVENUES FOR THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT  INCREASED  $6.4 MILLION  OR  6.3%  , AND  $46.8 MILLION  OR  16.0%  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN FISCAL 2018. THESE  INCREASES  WERE A RESULT OF HIGHER SELLING PRICES AND HIGHER VOLUMES OF STEEL PROCESSED DURING THE PERIODS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY IMPROVEMENTS IN VARIOUS MARKETS. THESE  INCREASES  WERE ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREMENTAL REVENUES FROM OUR ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED DURING THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME  THE FOLLOWING TABLE REFLECTS THE BREAKDOWN OF OPERATING INCOME BY SEGMENT (IN THOUSANDS).

OPERATING MARGINS WERE  8.7%  AND  (11.3)%  , FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AND  2017  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  6.7%  AND  (1.0)%  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AND  2017  , RESPECTIVELY. THESE  INCREASES  WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE POSITIVE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PROJECT MARGINS. IN ADDITION, FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $8.3 MILLION, CLASSIFIED WITHIN COST OF SALES, RELATED TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT THAT WAS RETIRED AND A PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS OF $2.9 MILLION, CLASSIFIED WITHIN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE, RESULTING FROM AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION RELATED TO CERTAIN OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES. NO SUCH CHARGES WERE RECORDED IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT  DECREASED  BY  $3.4 MILLION  OR  15.7%  AND  $0.8 MILLION  OR  1.2%  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN FISCAL 2018. THESE DECREASES WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER ZINC AND LABOR COSTS AND A ONE-TIME CHARGE OF $1.3 MILLION INCURRED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND OTHER DISPOSAL COSTS RELATED TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF TWO GALVANIZING FACILITIES IN THE GULF COAST REGION OF THE UNITED STATES. THESE UNFAVORABLE TRENDS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED VOLUMES AND SELLING PRICES. OPERATING MARGINS WERE  17.0%  AND  21.4%  , FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AND  2017  , RESPECTIVELY AND  19.3%  AND  22.7%  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AND  2017  , RESPECTIVELY. THESE DECLINES WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER ZINC AND LABOR COSTS, WHICH WERE NOT FULLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SELLING PRICES, AND THE ONE-TIME CHARGE FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF FACILITIES.  CORPORATE EXPENSES  CORPORATE EXPENSES  DECREASED  BY  $0.9 MILLION  OR  11.2%  , AND INCREASED  $3.4 MILLION  OR  14.0%  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIODS. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WE RECORDED LOWER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT GRANTS THAT WERE FORFEITED WHEN VARIOUS VESTING CONDITIONS WERE NOT SATISFIED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD, THE DECLINE IN SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY INCREASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, OUTSIDE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND GENERAL CORPORATE MARKETING ACTIVITIES.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  WAS  $3.7 MILLION  AND  $11.5 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO  $3.5 MILLION  AND  $10.3 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIODS. THESE INCREASES WERE THE RESULT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON VARIABLE RATE DEBT AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER AVERAGE OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES. OUR GROSS DEBT TO EQUITY RATIO WAS  0.46  TO 1 AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , COMPARED TO 0.57 TO 1 AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2017.  INCOME TAXES  THE PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES REFLECTS AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  17.8%  AND  (91.6)%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NET LOSS INCURRED AND VARIOUS TAX BENEFITS RECEIVED DURING THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES REFLECTS AN EFFECTIVE RATE OF  19.9%  AND  24.2%  , FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017.  WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY BANKRUPTCY CASE  WE HAD EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH SUBSIDIARIES OF WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY (\u201cWEC\u201d). WEC AND THE RELEVANT SUBSIDIARIES (THE \"DEBTORS\") FILED RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE ON MARCH 29, 2017 IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, JOINTLY ADMINISTERED AS IN RE WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY, ET AL., CASE NO. 17-10751 (THE \"BANKRUPTCY CASE\"). TO DATE, WEC HAS CONTINUED TO OPERATE UNDER A DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION FINANCING FACILITY AND WE CONTINUE TO HONOR THEIR EXECUTORY CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN COLLECTING ON POST-PETITION AMOUNTS DUE AND OWED. ON FEBRUARY 22, 2018, THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK APPROVED THE DEBTORS\u2019 MODIFIED FIRST AMENDED DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FOR THE JOINT CHAPTER 11 PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. IN THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, THE DEBTORS ESTIMATED A 98.9% TO 100% DISTRIBUTION ON ALLOWED GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS. WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION OF SUCH CLAIMS FILED WITH THE COURT, WHICH INCLUDES 100% OF OUR PRE-PETITION CLAIMS. THE TOTAL CLAIMS FILED EXCEED THE BOOK VALUE OF OUR EXPOSURE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY MET OUR CASH NEEDS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ALONG WITH BANK AND BOND MARKET DEBT. OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS ARE GENERALLY FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES, CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, DEBT REPAYMENT, ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH POSITION, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR EXPECTATION OF CONTINUING AVAILABILITY TO DRAW UPON OUR CREDIT FACILITIES ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CASH FLOW NEEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  CASH FLOWS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOWS BY CATEGORY FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED (IN THOUSANDS).  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  2018  2017  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $60,395  $38,710  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (21,329  )  (54,174  )  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (41,565  )  14,211  FOR THE  NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $60.4 MILLION  , NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $21.3 MILLION  , NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $41.6 MILLION  , AND A DECREASE OF  $0.9 MILLION  FROM THE NET EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH RESULTING IN A NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $3.4 MILLION  . IN COMPARISON TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  , THE RESULTS IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , ARE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME AND MORE FAVORABLE IMPACTS OF CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL. THE COMPANY'S USE OF CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS LOWER DUE TO DECREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LOWER SPENDING FOR ACQUISITIONS. NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS HIGHER DURING THE  NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO NET PAYMENTS MADE ON OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL WAS  $239.6 MILLION  AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , AS COMPARED TO  $197.4 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  FINANCING AND CAPITAL  AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , THE COMPANY HAD  $273.0 MILLION  OF FLOATING AND FIXED RATE NOTES OUTSTANDING WITH VARYING MATURITIES THROUGH FISCAL 2023 AND THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE COVENANTS RELATED TO THESE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY REPAID $14.3 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL RELATED TO ITS OUTSTANDING NOTES ON THE SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE. AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY $282.9 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CREDIT AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE DRAWS OR LETTERS OF CREDIT.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS SEE NOTE 7 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FURTHER BELOW UNDER CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  IN JANUARY OF 2012, OUR BOARD AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO TEN PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE, AND THE AMOUNT AND PRICES PAID FOR ANY FUTURE SHARE PURCHASES UNDER THE AUTHORIZATION WILL BE BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS AT THE TIME OF THE PURCHASE. REPURCHASES UNDER THIS SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION WOULD BE MADE THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, INCLUDING RULE 10B-18 UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT. THE COMPANY DID NOT MAKE ANY REPURCHASES OF ITS COMMON SHARES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  OTHER EXPOSURES  WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY PRICE INCREASES IN BOTH SEGMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS, PRIMARILY COPPER, ALUMINUM, STEEL AND NICKEL BASED ALLOYS IN THE ENERGY SEGMENT AND ZINC AND NATURAL GAS IN THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT. WE ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE THESE  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INCREASES THROUGH ESCALATION CLAUSES IN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS FOR COPPER, ALUMINUM, STEEL AND NICKEL BASED ALLOYS, WHEN MARKET CONDITIONS ALLOW AND THROUGH FIXED COST CONTRACT PURCHASES ON ZINC. IN ADDITION TO THESE MEASURES, WE ATTEMPT TO RECOVER OTHER COST INCREASES THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, AND THROUGH INCREASES IN PRICES WHERE COMPETITIVELY FEASIBLE.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS DEFINED UNDER SEC RULES. SPECIFICALLY,  THERE WERE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS, ARRANGEMENTS, OBLIGATIONS (INCLUDING CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS), OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR OTHER PERSONS THAT HAVE, OR MAY HAVE, A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GAAP REQUIRES US TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON CURRENT FACTS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO DETERMINE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.  DURING THE  NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ADOPTION OF ASC 606, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AS COMPARED TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES DISCLOSED IN PART II, ITEM 7.

EACH OF THESE DECISIONS HAS SOME IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD.  IN MAKING THESE DECISIONS, WE CONSIDER VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, COMPETITION, INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FINANCIAL TARGETS AND EXPECTATIONS, AND FINANCIAL PLANNING OBJECTIVES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, SEE \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\u201d SECTION INCLUDED IN THIS \u201cMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\u201d  EXTREME NETWORKS, INC., TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \u201cEXTREME\u201d AND AS \u201cWE\u201d, \u201cUS\u201d AND \u201cOUR\u201d) IS A LEADING PROVIDER OF NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE AND OFFERS RELATED MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS FOR EXTENDED WARRANTY AND MAINTENANCE TO OUR ENTERPRISE, DATA CENTER AND SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS.  WE WERE INCORPORATED IN CALIFORNIA IN MAY 1996 AND REINCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN MARCH 1999.  OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA. WE DERIVE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF OUR NETWORKING EQUIPMENT AND RELATED MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS.  EXTREME IS A LEADER IN PROVIDING SOFTWARE-DRIVEN NETWORKING SOLUTIONS FOR ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS. PROVIDING A COMBINED END-TO-END SOLUTION FROM THE DATA CENTER TO THE ACCESS POINT, EXTREME DESIGNS, DEVELOPS AND MANUFACTURES WIRED AND WIRELESS NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE EQUIPMENT AND DEVELOPS THE SOFTWARE FOR NETWORK MANAGEMENT, POLICY, ANALYTICS, SECURITY AND ACCESS CONTROLS. WE STRIVE TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS CONNECT BEYOND THE NETWORK BY BUILDING WORLD-CLASS SOFTWARE AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS THAT SOLVE THE WIDE RANGE OF PROBLEMS FACED BY IT DEPARTMENTS.  ENTERPRISE NETWORK ADMINISTRATORS FROM THE DATA CENTER TO THE ACCESS LAYER NEED TO RESPOND TO THE RAPID DIGITAL TRANSFORMATIONAL TRENDS OF CLOUD, MOBILITY, BIG DATA, SOCIAL BUSINESS AND THE EVER-PRESENT NEED FOR NETWORK SECURITY.  ACCELERATORS SUCH AS INTERNET OF THINGS (\u201cIOT\u201d), ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (\u201cAI\u201d), BRING YOUR OWN DEVICE (\u201cBYOD\u201d), MACHINE LEARNING, COGNITIVE COMPUTING, AND ROBOTICS ADD COMPLEXITY TO CHALLENGE THE CAPABILITIES OF TRADITIONAL NETWORKS. TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ACROSS THE ENTIRE ENTERPRISE NETWORK PLACING UNPRECEDENTED DEMANDS ON NETWORK ADMINISTRATORS TO ENHANCE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES, SCALABILITY, PROGRAMMABILITY, AGILITY, AND ANALYTICS OF THE ENTERPRISE NETWORKS THEY MANAGE.  A TREND AFFECTING THE ENTERPRISE NETWORK EQUIPMENT MARKET IS THE CONTINUED ADOPTION OF THE CLOUD-MANAGED ENTERPRISE WLAN IN THE ENTERPRISE MARKET. HYBRID CLOUD IS A CLOUD COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT WHICH USES A MIX OF ON-PREMISES, PRIVATE CLOUD AND THIRD-PARTY, PUBLIC CLOUD SERVICES WITH ORCHESTRATION BETWEEN THE TWO PLATFORMS.  WE BELIEVE THAT UNDERSTANDING THE FOLLOWING KEY DEVELOPMENTS IS HELPFUL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  TO FACILITATE THE READERS UNDERSTANDING, THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF COMMON TERMS IN OUR INDUSTRY USED IN THE DISCUSSION OF OUR BUSINESS.  \u2022  ACCESS.  NETWORK ACCESS IS THE CLOSEST POINT OF ENTRY TO A NETWORK WHETHER IT IS A WIRELESS ACCESS POINT, ETHERNET CONNECTION, OR WI-FI DEVICE.  28  \u2022  ACCESS POINT.  A WIRELESS ACCESS POINT, OR MORE GENERALLY JUST ACCESS POINT (\u201cAP\u201d), IS A NETWORKING HARDWARE DEVICE THAT ALLOWS A WI-FI DEVI  CE TO CONNECT TO A WIRED NETWORK.  (SOURCE: INDUSTRY TERM)  \u2022  AGGREGATION.  IN COMPUTER NETWORKING, THE TERM AGGREGATION APPLIES TO VARIOUS METHODS OF COMBINING (AGGREGATING) MULTIPLE NETWORK CONNECTIONS IN PARALLEL IN ORDER TO INCREASE THROUGHPUT BEYOND WHAT A SINGLE CONNECTION COULD SUSTAIN, AND TO PROVIDE REDUNDANCY IN CASE ONE OF THE LINKS SHOULD FAIL.  \u2022  ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  : ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (\u201cAI\u201d) IS A SET OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ENABLE COMPUTERS TO SIMULATE THE COGNITIVE KNOWLEDGE-PROCESSING CAPABILITIES OF HUMANS. BECAUSE IT IS ARTIFICIAL, THE OBJECTIVE OF MOST WORK IN AI IS TO  AUGMENT  THE CAPABILITIES OF HUMANS, NOT TO REPLACE THEM. JUST AS COMPUTERS IN GENERAL ARE APPLIED TO THE TEDIOUS AND REPETITIVE TASKS THAT HUMANS FIND TEDIOUS, AI-BASED SOLUTIONS CAN DEAL WITH OFTEN LARGE (\u201cBIG DATA\u201d) VOLUMES OF DIGITALLY-ENCODED INFORMATION DISPASSIONATELY, UNEMOTIONALLY, RAPIDLY, AND, DEPENDING UPON THE PARAMETERS OF A SPECIFIC APPLICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION, ACCURATELY. IN NETWORK ADMINISTRATION, AI CAN BE APPLIED TO DEALING WITH THE \u201cMORE-VARIABLES-THAN-EQUATIONS NATURE\u201d OF RADIO FREQUENCY SETTINGS IN EVEN VERY- LARGE-SCALE WI-FI INSTALLATIONS.  THE GOAL IS TO ACHIEVE OPTIMAL NETWORK-WIDE PERFORMANCE MORE ACCURATELY AND AT LOWER COST THAN WOULD BE POSSIBLE WITH HUMANS ALONE.  \u2022  CAMPUS NETWORK  : A CAMPUS NETWORK, OR CAMPUS AREA NETWORK, OR CORPORATE AREA NETWORK (\u201cCAN\u201d) IS A COMPUTER NETWORK MADE UP OF AN INTERCONNECTION OF LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (\u201cLANS\u201d) WITHIN A LIMITED GEOGRAPHICAL AREA, SUCH AS A COLLEGE CAMPUS, COMPANY CAMPUS, HOSPITAL, HOTEL, CONVENTION CENTER OR SPORTS VENUE.  \u2022  CLOUDSTACK.  CLOUDSTACK IS AN OPEN SOURCE CLOUD COMPUTING SOFTWARE FOR CREATING, MANAGING, AND DEPLOYING INFRASTRUCTURE CLOUD SERVICES.  IT USES EXISTING HYPERVISORS SUCH AS KVM, VMWARE ESXI AND XENSERVER/XCP FOR VIRTUALIZATION.  \u2022  CORE.  A CORE NETWORK, OR NETWORK CORE, IS THE CENTRAL PART OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK THAT PROVIDES VARIOUS SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS WHO ARE CONNECTED BY THE ACCESS NETWORK.  \u2022  DATA CENTER.  A DATA CENTER IS A FACILITY USED TO HOUSE COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND ASSOCIATED COMPONENTS, SUCH AS TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND STORAGE SYSTEMS. IT GENERALLY INCLUDES REDUNDANT OR BACKUP POWER SUPPLIES, REDUNDANT DATA COMMUNICATIONS CONNECTIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS (E.G. AIR CONDITIONING, FIRE SUPPRESSION) AND VARIOUS SECURITY DEVICES.  \u2022  DATA CENTER FABRIC  TECHNOLOGIES  : ALSO KNOWN AS IP FABRIC, IS THE BASIC TOPOLOGY OF HOW A NETWORK IS LAID OUT AND CONNECTED TO SWITCH TRAFFIC ON A DATA OR CIRCUIT-SWITCHED NETWORK.  \u2022  EDGE  : AN EDGE DEVICE IS A DEVICE WHICH PROVIDES AN ENTRY POINT INTO ENTERPRISE OR SERVICE PROVIDER CORE NETWORKS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE ROUTERS, ROUTING SWITCHES, INTEGRATED ACCESS DEVICES (\u201cIADS\u201d), MULTIPLEXERS, AND A VARIETY OF METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK (\u201cMAN\u201d) AND WIDE AREA NETWORK (\u201cWAN\u201d) ACCESS DEVICES.  \u2022  FABRIC ATTACH  : EXTREME\u2019S FABRIC ATTACH (\u201cFA\u201d) FUNDAMENTALLY INTRODUCES AUTONOMIC/AUTOMATIC ATTACHMENT TO NETWORK SERVICES FOR END USERS IOT DEVICES TO A NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE. FABRIC ATTACH AND FABRIC CONNECT ARE KEY BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE EXTREME FABRIC ARCHITECTURE.  \u2022  FABRIC CONNECT  :   FABRIC CONNECT IS AN EXTENDED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE IEEE/IEFT STANDARDS FOR SHORTEST PATH BRIDGING (\u201cSPB\u201d).  IT OFFERS A FULL-SERVICE NETWORK VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGY THAT COMBINES THE BEST OF ETHERNET AND THE BEST OF IP USING A SINGLE NETWORK PROTOCOL INSTEAD OF THE MULTIPLE REQUIRED FOR COMPETITIVE SOLUTIONS.  \u2022  FLIPPED CLASSROOM.  FLIPPED CLASSROOM IS AN INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGY AND A TYPE OF BLENDED LEARNING THAT REVERSES THE TRADITIONAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENT BY DELIVERING INSTRUCTIONAL CONTENT, OFTEN ONLINE, OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM.  \u2022  INTERNET PROTOCOL.  INTERNET PROTOCOL (\u201cIP\u201d) IS THE PRINCIPAL SET (OR COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOL) OF DIGITAL MESSAGE FORMATS AND RULES FOR EXCHANGING MESSAGES BETWEEN COMPUTERS ACROSS A SINGLE NETWORK OR A SERIES OF INTERCONNECTED NETWORKS, USING THE INTERNET PROTOCOL SUITE (OFTEN REFERRED TO AS TCP/IP)  \u2022  LAYER 3 DATA CENTER INTERCONNECT;  A DATA CENTER INTERCONNECT (\u201cDCI\u201d) REFERS TO THE NETWORKING OF TWO OR MORE DIFFERENT DATA CENTERS TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS OR IT OBJECTIVES. THIS INTERCONNECTIVITY BETWEEN SEPARATE DATA CENTERS ENABLES THEM TO WORK TOGETHER, SHARE RESOURCES AND/OR PASS WORKLOADS BETWEEN ONE ANOTHER.  A LAYER 3 DCI REFERS TO INTERCONNECTION MADE THROUGH LAYER 3 OF THE COMMONLY-REFERENCED MULTILAYERED COMMUNICATION MODEL, OPEN SYSTEMS INTERCONNECTION (\u201cOSI\u201d).  \u2022  MACHINE LEARNING  : MACHINE LEARNING (\u201cML\u201d) IS A SET OF TECHNOLOGIES, AND ITSELF A BRANCH OF AI, THAT ENABLES COMPUTERS TO SIMULATE HUMAN LEARNING, WITH LEARNING DEFINED HERE AS THE ABILITY TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR AND/OR ESSENTIAL CAPABILITIES (AGAIN, SIMULATED AS A DIGITAL PROCESS ON A COMPUTER) IN RESPONSE TO NEW INFORMATION SUITABLY ENCODED FOR CONSUMPTION BY THE ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTING ML. IN OTHER WORDS, ML ENABLES AI-BASED PROCESSES TO \u201cLEARN\u201d FROM PAST BEHAVIORS AND CONSEQUENTLY TO IMPROVE FUTURE RESULTS, IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION BENEFITS HUMANS.  29  \u2022  NETWORK AUTOMATION  : NETWORK AUTOMATION (\u201cNA\u201d) IS A METHODOL  OGY IN WHICH SOFTWARE AUTOMATICALLY CONFIGURES, PROVISIONS, MANAGES AND TESTS NETWORK DEVICES. IT IS USED BY ENTERPRISES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND REDUCE HUMAN ERROR AND OPERATING EXPENSES.  \u2022  OPENSTACK.  OPENSTACK SOFTWARE CONTROLS LARGE POOLS OF COMPUTE, STORAGE, AND NETWORKING RESOURCES THROUGHOUT A DATACENTER, MANAGED THROUGH A DASHBOARD OR VIA THE OPENSTACK API. OPENSTACK WORKS WITH POPULAR ENTERPRISE AND OPEN SOURCE TECHNOLOGIES MAKING IT IDEAL FOR HETEROGENEOUS INFRASTRUCTURE. (SOURCE: OPENSTACK.ORG)  \u2022  SINGLE PANE OF GLASS.  SINGLE PANE OF GLASS IS A TERM USED TO DESCRIBE A MANAGEMENT DISPLAY CONSOLE THAT INTEGRATES ALL PARTS OF A COMPUTER INFRASTRUCTURE.  \u2022  STACKSTORM  : A PLATFORM FOR INTEGRATION AND AUTOMATION ACROSS SERVICES AND TOOLS. IT TIES EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND APPLICATION ENVIRONMENT TO AUTOMATE THAT ENVIRONMENT. IT HAS A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON TAKING ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO EVENTS.  \u2022  WI-FI  : WIRELESS ACCESS POINTS USING RADIO FREQUENCY AND PROTOCOLS TO ALLOW COMPUTERS, SMARTPHONES, OR OTHER DEVICES TO CONNECT TO THE INTERNET OR COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER WIRELESSLY WITHIN AN AREA.  \u2022  WORKFLOW COMPOSER  : EXTREME\u2019S EVENT-DRIVEN AUTOMATION TOOL THAT ALLOWS FOR CUSTOMIZABLE WORKFLOWS AND AUTOMATION TO DRIVE PROVISIONING, CONFIGURATION, AND TROUBLESHOOTING ACTIONS IN A MULTI-VENDOR ENVIRONMENT  INDUSTRY BACKGROUND  ENTERPRISES ARE ADOPTING NEW IT DELIVERY MODELS AND APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE FUNDAMENTAL NETWORK ALTERATIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS SPANNING FROM DEVICE ACCESS POINT TO THE NETWORK CORE. AI AND ML TECHNOLOGIES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO VASTLY IMPROVE THE NETWORK EXPERIENCE. WHEN AI AND ML ARE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN NA TECHNOLOGY, ADMINISTRATORS CAN MAKE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN PRODUCTIVITY, AVAILABILITY, ACCESSIBILITY, MANAGEABILITY, SECURITY AND SPEED OF THEIR NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE. THESE EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ARE DRIVING ADMINISTRATORS TO A MINDSET OF CHANGE TOWARD AGILE PROCESSES THAT ALLOW A VERSATILE WORKFORCE TO IMPROVE THE RATE OF INNOVATION OF THE ENTERPRISE SAFELY, SECURELY AND WITH CONFIDENCE.  AI, ML AND NA HAVE INCREASED THE RELEVANCE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE NETWORK IN THE ENTERPRISE. TRADITIONAL NETWORK OFFERINGS ARE NOT WELL-SUITED TO FULFILL ENTERPRISE EXPECTATIONS FOR RAPID DELIVERY OF NEW SERVICES, MORE FLEXIBLE BUSINESS MODELS, REAL-TIME RESPONSE AND MASSIVE SCALABILITY.  THE NETWORKING INDUSTRY APPEARS TO BE INVIGORATED BY THIS WAVE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE.  \u2022  ETHERNET (WIRED AND WIRELESS) HAS SOLIDIFIED ITS ROLE IN BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NETWORKS THROUGH ITS SCALABILITY, ADAPTABILITY AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE ENTERPRISES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS EXPECT THE TECHNOLOGY TO FOLLOW A PRICE-PERFORMANCE CURVE THAT MANDATES CONTINUED INNOVATION BY ETHERNET VENDORS.  \u2022  THE MOBILE WORKFORCE CONTINUES TO PROLIFERATE.  EMPLOYEES EXPECT HIGH-QUALITY AND SECURE ACCESS TO CORPORATE RESOURCES IN A BYOD WORLD ACROSS A DIVERSITY OF ENDPOINTS SUCH AS LAPTOPS, TABLETS, SMART PHONES AND WEARABLES, WHETHER THEY ARE WITHIN THE CORPORATE FIREWALL OR ON-THE-GO.  WITH EXTREMEMANAGEMENT, IT DEPARTMENTS FOCUS THEIR INVESTMENT DECISIONS ON THIS MOBILE WORKFORCE, TAKING A UNIFIED VIEW OF WIRELESS ACCESS, FROM THE CAMPUS CORE AND THE DATA CENTER.  EXTREME OFFERS END-TO-END SOLUTIONS THAT PERMIT IT MANAGERS TO MEET EMPLOYEE EXPECTATIONS AND TO MAXIMIZE IT RETURN ON INVESTMENT.  \u2022  VERTICALS SUCH AS RETAIL, FINANCE, HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION, MANUFACTURING, GOVERNMENT AND HOSPITALITY (WHICH INCLUDES SPORTS AND ENTERTAINMENT VENUES) ARE CONNECTING WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS AND GUESTS BEYOND THE NETWORK.  THESE ENTERPRISES ARE INVESTING IN GUEST AND LOCATION TECHNOLOGIES THAT CONNECT WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS VIA THEIR MOBILE DEVICES OVER THEIR WLAN. THIS ALLOWS THEM TO OBTAIN RICH ANALYTICS FOR CONTEXTUAL MARKETING, WHICH IN TURN, ENABLES THEM TO DELIVER A PERSONALIZED BRAND EXPERIENCE. EXTREMEGUEST AND EXTREMELOCATION HAVE BEEN BUILT ON CLOUD-BASED TECHNOLOGY FOR SIMPLE IMPLEMENTATION AND FAST RELEASE TO MARKET TO BETTER PROVIDE NECESSARY INSIGHTS INTO GUEST DEMOGRAPHICS AND LOCATION-BASED ANALYTICS.  \u2022  THE INTERNET OF THINGS.  THE INTERNET OF THINGS IS HAVING DRAMATIC EFFECTS ON NETWORK  INFRASTRUCTURE IN HEALTHCARE, EDUCATION, MANUFACTURING, GOVERNMENT AND RETAIL AS MORE \u201cSMART\u201d DEVICES ARE ENTERING THE NETWORKS.  THESE DEVICES POSE OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS THREATS TO THE NETWORK.  \u2022  GROWING USAGE OF THE CLOUD.  ENTERPRISES HAVE MIGRATED INCREASING NUMBERS OF APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES TO EITHER PRIVATE CLOUDS OR PUBLIC CLOUDS OFFERED BY THIRD PARTIES.  IN EITHER CASE, THE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE MUST ADAPT TO THIS NEW DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT.  INTELLIGENCE AND AUTOMATION ARE KEY IF ENTERPRISES ARE TO DERIVE MAXIMUM BENEFIT FROM THEIR CLOUD DEPLOYMENTS. ETHERNET SPEEDS, SCALING FROM 10 GIGABITS PER SECOND (\"G\") TO 100G, PROVIDE THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC CLOUDS. IN ADDITION, THERE IS GROWING INTEREST IN SDN APPROACHES THAT MAY INCLUDE TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS OPENFLOW, OPENSTACK, AND CLOUDSTACK FOR INCREASED NETWORK AGILITY.  30  \u2022  VENDOR CONSOLIDATION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE.  CONSOLIDATION OF VENDORS W  ITHIN THE ENTERPRISE NETWORK EQUIPMENT MARKET AND BETWEEN ADJACENT MARKETS (STORAGE, SECURITY, WIRELESS & VOICE SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS) CONTINUES TO GAIN MOMENTUM. FURTHER, WE BELIEVE CUSTOMERS ARE DEMANDING MORE END-TO-END, INTEGRATED NETWORKING SOLUTI  ONS. TO ADDRESS THIS DEMAND, WE ACQUIRED THE WLAN BUSINESS OF ZEBRA IN OCTOBER 2016, THE CAMPUS FABRIC BUSINESS FROM AVAYA IN JULY 2017, AND THE DATA CENTER BUSINESS FROM BROCADE IN OCTOBER 2017.  OUR STRATEGY, PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH WHAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS THE FOLLOWING TRENDS IN OUR INDUSTRY.  \u25cb  THE SOFTWARE SEGMENT OF THE WORLDWIDE ENTERPRISE NETWORK EQUIPMENT MARKET HAS CONTINUED TO EVOLVE AND DEMANDS FOR IMPROVEMENTS IN NETWORK MANAGEMENT WILL CONTINUE.  \u27a3  WE ANNOUNCED OUR EXTREME MANAGEMENT CONSOLE IN FISCAL 2017.  THIS INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE HELPS IT NETWORK ADMINISTRATORS TO NAVIGATE THE UNPRECEDENTED DEMANDS CAUSED BY THE SURGE OF IOT DEVICES AND TECHNOLOGY.  \u25cb  ENTERPRISE ADOPTION OF THE CLOUD AND OPEN-SOURCE OPTIONS ARE DISRUPTING TRADITIONAL LICENSE AND MAINTENANCE BUSINESS MODELS.  \u27a3  WE ANNOUNCED CLOUD OFFERINGS IN APRIL 2016 AND ENHANCED THOSE OFFERINGS IN 2017. EXTREME BEGAN PARTICIPATION IN THE OPENSWITCH PROGRAM IN MAY 2016 AND NOW PARTICIPATES IN THE STACKSTORM COMMUNITY WITH THE ACQUISITION FROM BROCADE IN NOVEMBER 2017.  O  ENTERPRISE ADOPTION OF NEW FINANCING SOLUTIONS ALLOWS FOR INCREASED FLEXIBILITY, LIMITED INVESTMENT AND ZERO LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS.  THESE OFFERINGS ARE CHANGING THE TRADITIONAL CAPEX MODEL TO (OPEX) MODELS USING FINANCING PURCHASES OVER TIME ARE DISRUPTING TRADITIONAL SELL-IN BUSINESS MODELS.  \u27a3  WE ANNOUNCED EXTREME CAPITAL SOLUTIONS IN APRIL 2018. THE OFFERING INCLUDES SUBSCRIPTION, CAPITAL LEASING AND USAGE BUSINESS MODELS THAT PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS.  \u25cb  GROWTH OF WIRELESS DEVICES CONTINUES TO OUTPACE HARDWIRE SWITCH GROWTH.  \u27a3  WE ANNOUNCED OUR 802.11AC WAVE 2 WIRELESS OFFERING IN LATE 2015 AND PLANS TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE OUR WIRELESS PORTFOLIO OF INDOOR AND OUTDOOR ACCESS POINTS, SUPPORTED BY THE JANUARY 2019, ANNOUNCEMENT OF OUR WI-FI 6 (802.11AX) PORTFOLIO OF ACCESS POINTS.  THE EXTREME STRATEGY  WE ARE FOCUSED ON DELIVERING END-TO-END IP NETWORKING SOLUTIONS FOR TODAY\u2019S ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTS.

THE CHANGE TO THE NOL RULES CREATES AN INDEFINITE LIVED DTA AND AS SUCH THE INDEFINITE LIVED DTL RELATED TO GOODWILL CAN NOW BE VIEWED AS A SOURCE OF INCOME FOR THE NEWLY CREATED INDEFINITE LIVED DTA.  THESE TWO INDEFINITE LIVED ITEMS CAN NOW BE NETTED IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE NEEDED.

AS A FISCAL YEAR TAXPAYER, WE WERE NOT SUBJECT TO THE MAJORITY OF THE TAX LAW PROVISIONS UNTIL FISCAL YEAR 2019; HOWEVER, THERE WERE CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT ITEMS OF IMPACT THAT WERE RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL YEAR 2018.  BECAUSE A CHANGE IN TAX LAW IS ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PERIOD OF ENACTMENT, THE EFFECTS OF THE TCJA, A TAX BENEFIT OF $2.5 MILLION, WAS REFLECTED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  AN ADDITIONAL IMPACT HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 IN THE AMOUNT OF $4.7 MILLION RELATING TO A VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELEASE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINALIZATION OF EVALUATING THE IMPACTS OF THE TCJA CHANGE PURSUANT TO SAB 118.

ACCORDINGLY, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE ESTIMATES MADE BY OUR MANAGEMENT. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE ESTIMATES AND ACTUAL RESULTS, OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS WILL BE AFFECTED.

PEO SERVICES' EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES  INCREASE  D  18%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , AS COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017  . THE  INCREASE  WAS DUE TO THE  INCREASE  D REVENUES DISCUSSED ABOVE OFFSET BY  AN INCREASE  IN EXPENSES OF  $157.3 MILLION  . THE  INCREASE  IN EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO  AN INCREASE  IN BENEFITS PASS-THROUGH COSTS OF  $124.3 MILLION  DESCRIBED ABOVE AND ADDITIONAL SUI RELATED COSTS.  PEO SERVICES' OVERALL MARGIN  INCREASED  FROM  13.9%  TO  14.8%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , AS COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017  , DUE TO OPERATING EFFICIENCIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATED INCURRED LOSSES RELATED TO ADP INDEMNITY IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , AS COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017.  ADP INDEMNITY PROVIDES WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYER'S LIABILITY DEDUCTIBLE REIMBURSEMENT INSURANCE PROTECTION FOR PEO SERVICES' WORKSITE EMPLOYEES UP TO $1 MILLION PER OCCURRENCE.  PEO SERVICES HAS SECURED A WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYER\u2019S LIABILITY INSURANCE POLICY THAT HAS A $1 MILLION PER OCCURRENCE RETENTION AND, IN FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND PRIOR, AGGREGATE STOP LOSS INSURANCE THAT COVERS ANY AGGREGATE LOSSES WITHIN THE $1 MILLION RETENTION THAT COLLECTIVELY EXCEED A CERTAIN LEVEL, FROM AN ADMITTED AND LICENSED INSURANCE COMPANY OF AIG.  WE UTILIZE HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE AND ACTUARIAL JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATED CLAIM LIABILITY, AND CHANGES IN ESTIMATED ULTIMATE INCURRED LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN THE PEO SEGMENT.  ADP INDEMNITY RECORDED A PRE-TAX BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION AND $10.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO $6.6 MILLION AND $19.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017  , RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATED INCURRED LOSSES.  FOR THE FISCAL YEARS 2013 TO 2018, ADP INDEMNITY PAID PREMIUMS TO ENTER INTO REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS WITH ACE AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANY, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CHUBB LIMITED, TO COVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL LOSSES INCURRED BY ADP INDEMNITY DURING THESE POLICY YEARS.  EACH OF THESE REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS LIMITS OUR OVERALL EXPOSURE INCURRED UP TO A CERTAIN LIMIT.  WE BELIEVE THE LIKELIHOOD OF ULTIMATE LOSSES EXCEEDING THIS LIMIT IS REMOTE. FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , ADP INDEMNITY PAID A PREMIUM OF  38  $218.0 MILLION  TO ENTER INTO A REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENT WITH CHUBB LIMITED TO COVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL LOSSES INCURRED BY ADP INDEMNITY FOR THE FISCAL  2019  POLICY YEAR ON TERMS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE FISCAL 2018 REINSURANCE POLICY.  OTHER  THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF THE \u201cOTHER\u201d SEGMENT ARE CERTAIN CORPORATE OVERHEAD CHARGES AND EXPENSES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, INCLUDING CORPORATE FUNCTIONS, COSTS RELATED TO OUR TRANSFORMATION OFFICE, NON-RECURRING GAINS AND LOSSES, THE ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, AND INTEREST EXPENSE.  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  FOR CORPORATE LIQUIDITY, WE EXPECT EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES, LONG-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH OUR  $9.8 BILLION  OF COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS BOTH LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM DEBT FINANCING FROM THE CAPITAL MARKETS, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES SUCH AS OUR REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL BENEFIT FROM THE ACT.  OUR ESTIMATED FISCAL 2019 ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS  24.4%  AND WE ANTICIPATE A FUTURE ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, EXCLUDING ONE TIME ITEMS, OF 25% TO 26% BEYOND FISCAL 2019.  WITH THIS INCREASED OPERATING CASH FLOW AND GREATER ACCESS TO OUR CASH WORLDWIDE, WE WILL CONTINUE OUR DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO CAPITAL ALLOCATION DECISIONS, INCLUDING ASSESSING REINVESTMENTS INTO THE BUSINESS, POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS, AND/OR RETURNING CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE BUYBACKS, AMONG OTHER POTENTIAL USES.  FOR CLIENT FUNDS LIQUIDITY, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO BORROW THROUGH OUR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS UNDER OUR U.S. SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND OUR U.S., CANADIAN AND UNITED KINGDOM SHORT-TERM REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS TOGETHER WITH OUR  $9.8 BILLION  OF COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES AND OUR ABILITY TO USE CORPORATE LIQUIDITY WHEN NECESSARY TO MEET SHORT-TERM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS.  PLEASE SEE \u201cQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\u201d FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS OF OUR CLIENT FUNDS EXTENDED INVESTMENT STRATEGY.  SEE  NOTE 10  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR SHORT-TERM FINANCING INCLUDING COMMERCIAL PAPER.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE  $2.8 BILLION  , INCLUDING  $1.2 BILLION  OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS, WERE PRIMARILY INVESTED IN TIME DEPOSITS AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING CASH FLOWS  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, AS REFLECTED IN THE STATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  , RESPECTIVELY, ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  2018  2017  $ CHANGE  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN).  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $931.5  $675.1  $256.4  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (469.2  )  (1,326.3  )  857.1  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (1,488.3  )  6,280.3  (7,768.6  )  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, RESTRICTED CASH, AND RESTRICTED CASH EQUIVALENTS  (32.1  )  49.1  (81.2  )  NET CHANGE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, RESTRICTED CASH, AND RESTRICTED CASH EQUIVALENTS  $(1,058.1  )  $5,678.2  $(6,736.3  )  NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2017  INCLUDE  CASH PAYMENTS FOR REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS OF  $218.0  MILLION AND  $235.0  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH REPRESENT THE POLICY PREMIUM FOR THE ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN OPERATING CASH PROVIDED IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A NET FAVORABLE CHANGE IN THE COMPONENTS OF WORKING CAPITAL AS COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017.  39  NET CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES CHANGED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF NET PROCEEDS FROM CORPORATE AND CLIENT FUNDS MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF  $450.8 MILLION  , LOWER PAYMENTS MADE RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS AND REDUCED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  NET CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES CHANGED PRIMARILY DUE TO A  NET DECREASE  IN CLIENT FUND OBLIGATIONS OF  $8,774.2 MILLION  , WHICH IS DUE TO THE TIMING OF IMPOUNDS FROM OUR CLIENTS AND PAYMENTS TO OUR CLIENTS' EMPLOYEES AND OTHER PAYEES, MORE CASH RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS VIA DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM COMMERCIAL PAPER.  WE PURCHASED  3.8 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF  $139.16  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , AS COMPARED TO PURCHASES OF  3.6 MILLION  SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF  $108.70  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017  .  FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY MAY REPURCHASE SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER ITS AUTHORIZED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS.  THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHEN TO EXECUTE SHARE REPURCHASES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL ACQUISITION ACTIVITY, CASH BALANCES AND CASH FLOWS, ISSUANCES DUE TO EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN ACTIVITY, AND MARKET CONDITIONS.  CAPITAL RESOURCES AND CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS  WE HAVE  $2.0 BILLION  OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES WITH MATURITY DATES IN 2020 AND 2025.  WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME REVISIT THE LONG-TERM DEBT MARKET TO REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT, FINANCE INVESTMENTS INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS FOR OUR GROWTH, AND MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE CAPITAL STRUCTURE.  HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT VOLATILITY IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS WOULD NOT IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THESE MARKETS ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR AT ALL.  SEE  NOTE 11  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR LONG-TERM FINANCING.  OUR U.S. SHORT-TERM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO CLIENT FUNDS ARE SOMETIMES OBTAINED ON AN UNSECURED BASIS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, RATHER THAN LIQUIDATING PREVIOUSLY-COLLECTED CLIENT FUNDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN INVESTED IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. THIS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR THE ISSUANCE OF UP TO  $9.8 BILLION  IN AGGREGATE MATURITY VALUE. OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM IS RATED A-1+ BY STANDARD & POOR\u2019S AND PRIME-1 (\u201cP-1\u201d) BY MOODY\u2019S.  THESE RATINGS DENOTE THE HIGHEST QUALITY COMMERCIAL PAPER SECURITIES.  MATURITIES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER CAN RANGE FROM OVERNIGHT TO UP TO 364 DAYS. AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE COMPANY HAD  $1.2 BILLION  OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING, WHICH WAS REPAID ON JANUARY 2, 2019. AT  JUNE 30, 2018  , THE COMPANY HAD  NO  COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  , OUR AVERAGE DAILY BORROWINGS WERE  $3.8 BILLION  AND  $3.5 BILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AT WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF  2.3%  AND  1.2%  , RESPECTIVELY.  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  , OUR AVERAGE DAILY BORROWINGS WERE  $3.8 BILLION  AND  $3.7 BILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AT WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF  2.1%  AND  1.2%  , RESPECTIVELY. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS APPROXIMATELY  TWO DAYS.  OUR U.S., CANADIAN AND UNITED KINGDOM SHORT-TERM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS ARE SOMETIMES OBTAINED ON A SECURED BASIS THROUGH THE USE OF REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, WHICH ARE COLLATERALIZED PRINCIPALLY BY GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES, RATHER THAN LIQUIDATING PREVIOUSLY-COLLECTED CLIENT FUNDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN INVESTED IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. THESE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY HAVE TERMS RANGING FROM OVERNIGHT TO UP TO FIVE BUSINESS DAYS.  WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY BORROWED THROUGH THE USE OF REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ON AN AS-NEEDED BASIS TO MEET SHORT-TERM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS. AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  JUNE 30, 2018  , THERE WERE  NO  OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THE REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  , WE HAD AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BALANCES UNDER REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OF  $325.4 MILLION  AND  $537.0 MILLION  , AT WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF  1.9%  AND  1.2%  , RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  , WE HAD AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BALANCES UNDER REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OF  $410.2 MILLION  AND  $531.6 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AT WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF  1.8%  AND  1.1%  , RESPECTIVELY.  WE VARY THE MATURITIES OF OUR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES TO LIMIT THE REFINANCING RISK OF ANY ONE FACILITY.  WE HAVE A  $3.8 BILLION  , 364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT MATURES IN  JUNE 2019  WITH A ONE YEAR TERM-OUT OPTION.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A FIVE-YEAR  $2.25 BILLION  CREDIT FACILITY AND A FIVE-YEAR  $3.75 BILLION  CREDIT FACILITY MATURING IN  JUNE 2022  AND  JUNE 2023  , RESPECTIVELY, EACH WITH AN ACCORDION FEATURE UNDER WHICH THE AGGREGATE COMMITMENT CAN BE INCREASED BY  $500 MILLION  , SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS.  THE PRIMARY USES OF THE CREDIT FACILITIES ARE TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND FUNDING FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, IF NECESSARY.  WE HAD NO BORROWINGS THROUGH  DECEMBER 31, 2018  UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CURRENTLY MEET ALL CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENTS TO BORROW THEREUNDER AND WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY CONDITIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT US FROM BORROWING PART OR ALL OF THE  $9.8 BILLION  AVAILABLE TO US UNDER  40  THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENTS. SEE  NOTE 10  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR SHORT-TERM FINANCING INCLUDING CREDIT FACILITIES.  OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES WITH UNDERLYING COLLATERAL OF SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES, ALTERNATIVE-A MORTGAGES, SUB-PRIME AUTO LOANS OR SUB-PRIME HOME EQUITY LOANS, COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS, COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATIONS, CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS, DERIVATIVES, AUCTION RATE SECURITIES, STRUCTURED INVESTMENT VEHICLES OR NON-INVESTMENT GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES.  WE OWN AAA-RATED SENIOR TRANCHES OF FIXED RATE CREDIT CARD, AUTO LOAN, EQUIPMENT LEASE AND RATE REDUCTION RECEIVABLES, SECURED PREDOMINANTLY BY PRIME COLLATERAL.  ALL COLLATERAL ON ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES IS PERFORMING AS EXPECTED.  IN ADDITION, WE OWN SENIOR DEBT DIRECTLY ISSUED BY FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS AND FEDERAL FARM CREDIT BANKS.  OUR CLIENT FUNDS INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS STRUCTURED TO ALLOW US TO AVERAGE OUR WAY THROUGH AN INTEREST RATE CYCLE BY LADDERING THE MATURITIES OF OUR INVESTMENTS OUT TO FIVE YEARS (IN THE CASE OF THE EXTENDED PORTFOLIO) AND OUT TO TEN YEARS (IN THE CASE OF THE LONG PORTFOLIO).  THIS INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS SUPPORTED BY OUR SHORT-TERM FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS NECESSARY TO SATISFY SHORT-TERM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS.  SEE  NOTE 8  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR CORPORATE INVESTMENTS AND FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WERE $77.0 MILLION  , AS COMPARED TO $104.9 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017  .  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL  2019  ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $200 MILLION  , AS COMPARED TO $192 MILLION  IN FISCAL  2018.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  OUR OVERALL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS COMPRISED OF CORPORATE INVESTMENTS (CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND LONG-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES) AND CLIENT FUNDS ASSETS (FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED FROM CLIENTS BUT HAVE NOT YET BEEN REMITTED TO THE APPLICABLE TAX AUTHORITIES OR CLIENT EMPLOYEES).  OUR CORPORATE INVESTMENTS ARE INVESTED IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND HIGHLY LIQUID, INVESTMENT-GRADE MARKETABLE SECURITIES.  THESE ASSETS ARE AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK FOR TREASURY AND/OR ACQUISITIONS, AS WELL AS OTHER CORPORATE OPERATING PURPOSES.  ALL OF OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES.  OUR CLIENT FUNDS ASSETS ARE INVESTED WITH SAFETY OF PRINCIPAL, LIQUIDITY, AND DIVERSIFICATION AS THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES. CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OBJECTIVES, WE ALSO SEEK TO MAXIMIZE INTEREST INCOME AND TO MINIMIZE THE VOLATILITY OF INTEREST INCOME.  CLIENT FUNDS ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN HIGHLY LIQUID, INVESTMENT-GRADE MARKETABLE SECURITIES, WITH A MAXIMUM MATURITY OF 10 YEARS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE, AND MONEY MARKET SECURITIES AND OTHER CASH EQUIVALENTS.  WE UTILIZE A STRATEGY BY WHICH WE EXTEND THE MATURITIES OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO FOR FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS AND EMPLOY SHORT-TERM FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS TO SATISFY OUR SHORT-TERM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS.  OUR CLIENT FUNDS INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS STRUCTURED TO ALLOW US TO AVERAGE OUR WAY THROUGH AN INTEREST RATE CYCLE BY LADDERING THE MATURITIES OF OUR INVESTMENTS OUT TO FIVE YEARS (IN THE CASE OF THE EXTENDED PORTFOLIO) AND OUT TO TEN YEARS (IN THE CASE OF THE LONG PORTFOLIO).  AS PART OF OUR CLIENT FUNDS INVESTMENT STRATEGY, WE USE THE DAILY COLLECTION OF FUNDS FROM OUR CLIENTS TO SATISFY OTHER UNRELATED CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS, RATHER THAN LIQUIDATING PREVIOUSLY-COLLECTED CLIENT FUNDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN INVESTED IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES.  WE MINIMIZE THE RISK OF NOT HAVING FUNDS COLLECTED FROM A CLIENT AVAILABLE AT THE TIME SUCH CLIENT\u2019S OBLIGATION BECOMES DUE BY IMPOUNDING, IN VIRTUALLY ALL INSTANCES, THE CLIENT\u2019S FUNDS IN ADVANCE OF THE TIMING OF PAYMENT OF SUCH CLIENT\u2019S OBLIGATION.  AS A RESULT OF THIS PRACTICE, WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY MAINTAINED THE REQUIRED LEVEL OF CLIENT FUNDS ASSETS TO SATISFY ALL OF OUR OBLIGATIONS.  THERE ARE INHERENT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVING OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY RELATING TO OUR CLIENT FUNDS ASSETS.  SUCH RISKS INCLUDE LIQUIDITY RISK, INCLUDING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE, IF NECESSARY, OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES IN A TIMELY MANNER IN ORDER TO SATISFY OUR CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS.  HOWEVER, OUR INVESTMENTS ARE MADE WITH THE SAFETY OF PRINCIPAL, LIQUIDITY, AND DIVERSIFICATION AS THE PRIMARY GOALS TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF NOT HAVING SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO SATISFY ALL OF OUR CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS.  WE ALSO BELIEVE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE RISK OF NOT HAVING SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO SATISFY OUR CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS BY CONSISTENTLY MAINTAINING ACCESS TO OTHER SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING OUR CORPORATE CASH BALANCES, AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR  $9.8 BILLION  COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM (RATED A-1+ BY STANDARD AND POOR\u2019S AND P-1 BY MOODY\u2019S, THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE CREDIT RATINGS), AND ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN REVERSE REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR  $9.8 BILLION  COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES.  THE REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING DURING PERIODS OF ECONOMIC TURMOIL, EVEN TO BORROWERS WITH THE HIGHEST CREDIT RATINGS, MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS SHORT-TERM DEBT MARKETS TO MEET THE LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESS.  IN ADDITION TO LIQUIDITY RISK, OUR INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK, AS DISCUSSED BELOW.  41  WE HAVE ESTABLISHED CREDIT QUALITY, MATURITY, AND EXPOSURE LIMITS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS.  THE MINIMUM ALLOWED CREDIT RATING AT TIME OF PURCHASE FOR CORPORATE, CANADIAN GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND CANADIAN PROVINCIAL BONDS IS BBB, FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES IS AAA, AND FOR MUNICIPAL BONDS IS A.  THE MAXIMUM MATURITY AT TIME OF PURCHASE FOR BBB-RATED SECURITIES IS 5 YEARS, FOR SINGLE A RATED SECURITIES IS 7 YEARS, AND FOR AA-RATED AND AAA-RATED SECURITIES IS 10 YEARS.  TIME DEPOSITS AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MUST BE RATED A-1 AND/OR P-1.  MONEY MARKET FUNDS MUST BE RATED AAA/AAA-MF.  DETAILS REGARDING OUR OVERALL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ARE AS FOLLOWS.

FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE EARNINGS IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE AMOUNT OF INVESTED FUNDS AND THE OVERALL PORTFOLIO MIX BETWEEN SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS.  THIS MIX VARIES DURING THE FISCAL YEAR AND IS IMPACTED BY DAILY INTEREST RATE CHANGES.  THE ANNUALIZED INTEREST RATES EARNED ON OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO  INCREASE  D FROM  1.8%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017  TO  2.1%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  A HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN BOTH SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES (E.G., OVERNIGHT INTEREST RATES OR THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE) AND INTERMEDIATE-TERM INTEREST RATES OF 25 BASIS POINTS APPLIED TO THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE INVESTMENT BALANCES AND ANY RELATED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS WOULD RESULT IN APPROXIMATELY A $11 MILLION IMPACT TO EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES OVER THE ENSUING TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING  DECEMBER 31, 2019  .  A HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN ONLY SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES OF 25 BASIS POINTS APPLIED TO THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT BALANCES AND ANY RELATED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS WOULD RESULT IN APPROXIMATELY A $4 MILLION IMPACT TO EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES OVER THE ENSUING TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING  DECEMBER 31, 2019.  WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN CONNECTION WITH OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES THROUGH THE POSSIBLE INABILITY OF THE BORROWERS TO MEET THE TERMS OF THE SECURITIES.  WE LIMIT CREDIT RISK BY INVESTING IN INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES, PRIMARILY AAA AND AA-RATED SECURITIES, AS RATED BY MOODY\u2019S, STANDARD & POOR\u2019S, DBRS FOR CANADIAN DENOMINATED SECURITIES, AND FITCH FOR ASSET-BACKED AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES. APPROXIMATELY  80%  OF OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES HELD A AAA OR AA RATING AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  IN ADDITION, WE LIMIT AMOUNTS THAT CAN BE INVESTED IN ANY SECURITY OTHER THAN U.S. GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT AGENCY, CANADIAN GOVERNMENT, AND UNITED KINGDOM GOVERNMENT SECURITIES.  42  WE OPERATE AND TRANSACT BUSINESS IN VARIOUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AND ARE THEREFORE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES THAT COULD IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, OR CASH FLOWS. WE MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO THESE MARKET RISKS THROUGH OUR REGULAR OPERATING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND, WHEN DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THROUGH THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  WE MAY USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND NOT FOR TRADING PURPOSES. WE HAD NO DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OUTSTANDING AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018.

WE REFER TO THE LAUNDRY LOCATIONS OF THE U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING REPORTING SEGMENT AS \u201cINDUSTRIAL LAUNDRIES\u201d OR \u201cINDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY LOCATIONS\u201d, AND TO THE U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING, MFG, AND CORPORATE REPORTING SEGMENTS COMBINED AS OUR \u201cCORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS.\u201d  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). AS SUCH, MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DEFINED AS THOSE THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES, THE MOST IMPORTANT AND PERVASIVE ACCOUNTING POLICIES USED AND AREAS MOST SENSITIVE TO MATERIAL CHANGES FROM EXTERNAL FACTORS. THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES THAT WE BELIEVE AFFECT OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT ARE DESCRIBED IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  AUGUST 25, 2018.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS CERTAIN SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA, INCLUDING THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES REPRESENTED BY EACH ITEM, FOR THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  AND  NOVEMBER 25, 2017.

GENERAL  WE DERIVE OUR REVENUES THROUGH THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, PERSONALIZATION, RENTAL, CLEANING, DELIVERING, AND SELLING OF A WIDE RANGE OF UNIFORMS AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING, INCLUDING SHIRTS, PANTS, JACKETS, COVERALLS, LAB COATS, SMOCKS AND APRONS AND SPECIALIZED PROTECTIVE WEAR, SUCH AS FLAME RESISTANT AND HIGH VISIBILITY GARMENTS. WE ALSO RENT INDUSTRIAL WIPING PRODUCTS, FLOOR MATS, FACILITY SERVICE PRODUCTS, OTHER NON-GARMENT ITEMS, AND PROVIDE RESTROOM AND CLEANING SUPPLIES AND FIRST AID CABINET SERVICES AND OTHER SAFETY SUPPLIES, TO A VARIETY OF MANUFACTURERS, RETAILERS AND SERVICE COMPANIES. WE HAVE FIVE REPORTING SEGMENTS, U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING, MFG, SPECIALTY GARMENTS, FIRST AID AND CORPORATE. WE REFER TO THE U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING, MFG, AND CORPORATE REPORTING SEGMENTS COMBINED AS OUR \u201cCORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS.\u201d  COST OF REVENUES INCLUDE THE AMORTIZATION OF RENTAL MERCHANDISE IN SERVICE AND MERCHANDISE COSTS RELATED TO DIRECT SALES AS WELL AS LABOR AND OTHER PRODUCTION, SERVICE AND DELIVERY COSTS, AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING OUR CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS, SPECIALTY GARMENTS FACILITIES, AND FIRST AID LOCATIONS. SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCLUDE COSTS RELATED TO OUR SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CORPORATE OFFICES, NON-OPERATING ENVIRONMENTAL SITES AND OPERATING LOCATIONS INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ENGINEERING, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT, MANUFACTURING PLANNING, FINANCE, BUDGETING, AND HUMAN RESOURCES.  WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PLANTS AND CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IN ENERGY PRODUCING REGIONS IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. IN GENERAL, WE ARE RELATIVELY MORE DEPENDENT ON BUSINESS IN THESE REGIONS THAN ARE MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DRAMATIC DECREASE IN OIL PRICES BEGINNING IN 2014 DIRECTLY AFFECTED OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY AS THEY CURTAILED THEIR LEVEL OF OPERATIONS, WHICH ALSO HAD A CORRESPONDING EFFECT ON OUR CUSTOMERS IN BUSINESSES WHICH SERVICE OR SUPPLY THE OIL INDUSTRY AS WELL AS OUR CUSTOMERS IN UNRELATED BUSINESSES LOCATED IN AREAS WHICH HAD BENEFITED FROM THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION GENERATED BY THE ROBUST GROWTH DRIVEN BY THE HIGHER OIL PRICES IN PRIOR YEARS. AS A RESULT, OUR ORGANIC GROWTH IN PERIODS FOLLOWING THIS DRAMATIC DECREASE IN OIL PRICES WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ELEVATED HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS IN OUR WEARER BASE AS WELL AS INCREASED LOST ACCOUNTS. RECENT TRENDS INDICATE THAT INCREASED ENERGY PRICES HAVE RESULTED IN STABILIZED OR IMPROVED WEARER LEVELS AT EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN OUR NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY-DEPENDENT MARKETS. OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE ALSO DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE COSTS OF THE GASOLINE USED TO FUEL OUR VEHICLES AND THE NATURAL GAS USED TO OPERATE OUR PLANTS. WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN ENERGY PRICES, IN GENERAL, WE BELIEVE THAT SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES WOULD HAVE AN OVERALL NEGATIVE  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS DUE TO CUTBACKS BY OUR CUSTOMERS BOTH IN, AND DEPENDENT UPON, THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRIES, WHICH WOULD OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS IN OUR OPERATING COSTS FROM LOWER ENERGY COSTS.  THE COST OF HEALTHCARE THAT WE PROVIDE TO OUR EMPLOYEES HAS GROWN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AT A RATE IN EXCESS OF OUR REVENUE GROWTH AND AS A RESULT, HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR OPERATING RESULTS. MOREOVER, IT IS GENERALLY EXPECTED THAT HEALTHCARE COSTS IN THE UNITED STATES WILL INCREASE OVER THE COMING YEARS AT RATES IN EXCESS OF INFLATION. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, AND DEPENDING ON THE EFFECT OF ANY MODIFICATIONS WE HAVE MADE, AND MAY MAKE IN THE FUTURE, TO OUR EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE PLANS AND ENROLLMENT LEVELS IN THOSE PLANS, WE EXPECT THAT OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE FURTHER ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY INCREASING HEALTHCARE COSTS.  OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS, INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENTS, OVERTIME REQUIREMENTS, WORKING CONDITION REQUIREMENTS, CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENTS, HEALTHCARE INSURANCE MANDATES AND OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IMPACT OUR LABOR COSTS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR LABOR COSTS WILL RISE IN FISCAL 2019 AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN STATE AND LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE LEVELS AS WELL AS THE OVERALL IMPACT OF WAGE PRESSURE AS THE RESULT OF A LOW UNEMPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT.  ON JANUARY 2, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZING US TO REPURCHASE FROM TIME TO TIME UP TO $100.0 MILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.  REPURCHASES MADE UNDER THE PROGRAM, IF ANY, WILL BE MADE IN EITHER THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE TIMING, MANNER, PRICE AND AMOUNT OF ANY REPURCHASES WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR STOCK PRICE, CORPORATE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND PRIORITIES, APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL BE FUNDED USING OUR AVAILABLE CASH OR CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT WHEN IMPLEMENTED AND MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.  DURING FISCAL 2017, WE RECORDED A PRE-TAX NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $55.8 MILLION ONCE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED WOULD BE COMPLETED AND PLACED INTO SERVICE. ON DECEMBER 28, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR LEAD CONTRACTOR FOR THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO WHICH WE RECORDED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WE WILL RECORD A TOTAL GAIN OF $20.3 MILLION DURING THE QUARTER ENDING FEBRUARY 23, 2019, WHICH INCLUDES OUR RECEIPT OF A ONE-TIME CASH PAYMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF  $13.0 MILLION  AS WELL AS THE FORGIVENESS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY DUE THE CONTRACTOR.  IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER OF 2018, WE INITIATED A MULTIYEAR CRM PROJECT TO FURTHER DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND DEPLOY A THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION WE LICENSED. THIS NEW SOLUTION IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, CAPABILITY AND INFORMATION FLOW AS WELL AS INCREASE AUTOMATION IN SERVICING OUR CUSTOMERS. AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , WE HAVE CAPITALIZED $3.8 MILLION RELATED TO OUR NEW CRM PROJECT.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cACT\u201d) WAS ENACTED, WHICH, AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS, REDUCED THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 FROM A 35% RATE TO A NEW 21% CORPORATE RATE AND IMPOSED A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON EARNINGS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE MADE REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF THE EFFECTS OF THE ACT AND THESE ESTIMATES COULD CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS AS WE CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF THE ACT (SEE NOTE 13, \u201cINCOME TAXES\u201d TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q).  A PORTION OF OUR SALES IS DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, INCLUDING CANADA. REVENUES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  7.9%  AND  8.0%  OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FOR  THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  AND  NOVEMBER 25, 2017  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AND SUCH RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY  MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. IN ADDITION, FLUCTUATIONS IN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE MARGINS OF OUR CANADIAN BUSINESS BECAUSE A WEAKER CANADIAN DOLLAR WILL INCREASE THE COST OF MERCHANDISE AND OTHER OPERATIONAL INPUTS THAT ARE SOURCED FROM OUTSIDE OF CANADA. OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE YEARS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ANY DEVALUATION, AS COMPARED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, OF THE CANADIAN DOLLAR OR ANY OF THE CURRENCIES OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  COMPARED WITH THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 25, 2017  REVENUES  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  NOVEMBER 24,  2018  NOVEMBER 25,  2017  DOLLAR  CHANGE  PERCENT  CHANGE  CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS  $390,477  $373,796  $16,681  4.5%  SPECIALTY GARMENTS  34,448  28,427  6,021  21.2%  FIRST AID  13,625  13,555  70  0.5%  CONSOLIDATED TOTAL  $438,550  $415,778  $22,772  5.5%  THE  INCREASE  IN OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY FROM OUR CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS. EXCLUDING THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF ACQUISITIONS, WHICH WE ESTIMATE INCREASED OUR REVENUES IN CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY  0.7%  , AS WELL AS A SLIGHTLY WEAKER CANADIAN DOLLAR, WHICH UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED OUR GROWTH BY  0.3%  , ORGANIC GROWTH FOR OUR CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS WAS  4.1%  . ORGANIC GROWTH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF NEW SALES, PRICING ADJUSTMENTS, AND NET CHANGES IN THE WEARER LEVELS AT OUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS, OFFSET BY LOST ACCOUNTS.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS BALANCES, OUR CASH GENERATED FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT (DEFINED BELOW) WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CURRENT ANTICIPATED WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OUR LIQUIDITY. WE GENERALLY USE THESE CASH FLOWS TO FUND MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF OUR OPERATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. WE MAY ALSO USE CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS PROCEEDS FROM LOANS PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT, TO FUND GROWTH AND ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES, AS WELL AS OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS.

THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH RECEIVED OF $3.0 MILLION FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL LITIGATION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THE  INCREASE  IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CASH OUTFLOWS RELATED TO BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  THE INCREASE IN CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF CASH DIVIDENDS PAID AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS PAID BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  LONG-TERM DEBT AND BORROWING CAPACITY  WE HAVE A $250 MILLION  UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH A SYNDICATE OF BANKS, WHICH MATURES ON  APRIL 11, 2021  . UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WE ARE ABLE TO BORROW FUNDS AT VARIABLE INTEREST RATES BASED ON, AT OUR ELECTION, THE EURODOLLAR RATE OR A BASE RATE, PLUS IN EACH CASE A SPREAD BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FUNDED DEBT RATIO. AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS, INCLUDING A MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED FUNDED DEBT RATIO AND MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. WE TEST OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS ON A FISCAL QUARTERLY BASIS. AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , THE INTEREST RATES APPLICABLE TO OUR BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WOULD BE CALCULATED AS LIBOR PLUS  75  BASIS POINTS AT THE TIME OF THE RESPECTIVE BORROWING. AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , WE HAD  NO  OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AND HAD OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AMOUNTING TO $71.4 MILLION  , LEAVING $178.6 MILLION  AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES  IN JANUARY 2015, WE ENTERED INTO SIXTEEN FORWARD CONTRACTS TO EXCHANGE CANADIAN DOLLARS (\u201cCAD\u201d) FOR U.S. DOLLARS AT FIXED EXCHANGE RATES IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE RELATED TO CERTAIN FORECASTED CAD DENOMINATED SALES OF ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE SPECIFIED AS THE FIRST AMOUNT OF CAD DENOMINATED REVENUES INVOICED BY ONE OF OUR DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES EACH FISCAL QUARTER, BEGINNING IN THE THIRD FISCAL QUARTER OF 2015 AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF 2019. IN TOTAL, WE WILL SELL APPROXIMATELY  31.0 MILLION  CAD AT AN AVERAGE CANADIAN-DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE OF  0.7825  OVER THESE QUARTERLY PERIODS. WE CONCLUDED THAT THE FORWARD CONTRACTS MET THE CRITERIA TO QUALIFY AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE UNDER U.S. GAAP. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE REFLECTED ALL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACTS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS, A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. UPON THE MATURITY OF EACH FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACT, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE CONTRACT WILL BE RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO REVENUES.  IN JUNE 2018, WE ENTERED INTO TWELVE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO EXCHANGE CAD FOR U.S. DOLLARS AT FIXED EXCHANGE RATES IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE RELATED TO CERTAIN FORECASTED CAD DENOMINATED SALES OF ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE SPECIFIED AS THE FIRST AMOUNT OF CAD DENOMINATED REVENUES INVOICED BY ONE OF OUR DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES EACH FISCAL QUARTER, BEGINNING IN THE THIRD FISCAL QUARTER OF 2019 AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF 2022. IN TOTAL, WE WILL SELL APPROXIMATELY  12.1 MILLION  CAD AT AN AVERAGE CANADIAN-DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE OF  0.7814  OVER THESE QUARTERLY PERIODS. WE CONCLUDED THAT THE FORWARD CONTRACTS MET THE CRITERIA TO QUALIFY AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE UNDER U.S. GAAP.  AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , WE HAD FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH A NOTIONAL VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY  13.4 MILLION  CAD OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS OF  $0.2 MILLION  IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS AND  $0.1 MILLION  IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS WITH A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS OF  $0.2 MILLION  , WHICH WAS RECORDED NET OF TAX. DURING THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , WE RECLASSIFIED A NOMINAL AMOUNT FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS TO REVENUE, RELATED TO THE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE GAIN ON THESE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT RESULTED IN A DECREASE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  IS EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO REVENUES PRIOR TO ITS MATURITY ON  FEBRUARY 25, 2022.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AIR EMISSIONS, WASTEWATER DISCHARGES, AND THE GENERATION, HANDLING, STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTES AND OTHER SUBSTANCES. IN PARTICULAR, INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRIES CURRENTLY USE AND MUST DISPOSE OF DETERGENT WASTE WATER AND OTHER RESIDUES, AND, IN THE PAST, USED PERCHLOROETHYLENE AND OTHER DRY CLEANING SOLVENTS. WE ARE ATTENTIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS SURROUNDING THE DISPOSAL OF THESE MATERIALS AND HAVE, THROUGH THE YEARS, TAKEN MEASURES TO AVOID THEIR IMPROPER DISPOSAL. OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE SETTLED, OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF, ACTIONS OR CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US RELATING TO THE DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO EXPEND MATERIAL AMOUNTS TO REMEDIATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH DISPOSAL IN THE FUTURE.  U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR CONTINGENCIES BE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF A LIABILITY, AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT TO BE RECORDED. WE REGULARLY CONSULT WITH ATTORNEYS AND OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS IN OUR CONSIDERATION OF THE RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE RECORDING A CONTINGENT LIABILITY. CHANGES IN ENACTED LAWS, REGULATORY ORDERS OR DECREES, OUR ESTIMATES OF COSTS, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES, INSURANCE PROCEEDS, PARTICIPATION BY OTHER PARTIES, THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS, THE INPUT OF OUR ATTORNEYS AND OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS OR OTHER FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES.  UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, AN OWNER OR LESSEE OF REAL ESTATE MAY BE LIABLE FOR THE COSTS OF REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION OF CERTAIN HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES LOCATED ON, OR IN, OR EMANATING FROM SUCH PROPERTY, AS WELL AS RELATED COSTS OF INVESTIGATION AND PROPERTY DAMAGE. SUCH LAWS OFTEN IMPOSE LIABILITY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE OWNER OR LESSEE KNEW OF, OR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR, THE PRESENCE OF SUCH HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT ACQUIRED OR LEASED LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN OPERATED IN COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR THAT FUTURE USES OR CONDITIONS WILL NOT RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY UPON OUR COMPANY UNDER SUCH LAWS OR EXPOSE OUR COMPANY TO THIRD PARTY ACTIONS SUCH AS TORT SUITS. WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS UNDER TERMS OF CONSENT ORDERS NEGOTIATED WITH THE APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL AUTHORITIES OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT TO SITES LOCATED IN OR RELATED TO WOBURN, MASSACHUSETTS, SOMERVILLE, MASSACHUSETTS, SPRINGFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS, UVALDE, TEXAS, STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA,  TWO  SITES RELATED TO FORMER OPERATIONS IN WILLIAMSTOWN, VERMONT, AS WELL AS SITES LOCATED IN GOLDSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA AND WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA.  WE HAVE ACCRUED CERTAIN COSTS RELATED TO THE SITES DESCRIBED ABOVE AS IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE COSTS ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. WE HAVE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE RELATED TO A PARCEL OF LAND (THE \u201cCENTRAL AREA\u201d) RELATED TO THE WOBURN, MASSACHUSETTS SITE MENTIONED ABOVE. CURRENTLY, THE CONSENT DECREE FOR THE WOBURN SITE DOES NOT DEFINE OR REQUIRE ANY REMEDIATION WORK IN THE CENTRAL AREA. THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (THE \u201cEPA\u201d) HAS PROVIDED US AND OTHER SIGNATORIES TO THE CONSENT DECREE WITH COMMENTS ON THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF GROUNDWATER AND SOIL REMEDIES AT THE WOBURN SITE AND INVESTIGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN THE CENTRAL AREA. WE, AND OTHER SIGNATORIES, HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND PROPOSED TO DO ADDITIONAL WORK AT THE WOBURN SITE BUT MANY OF THE EPA\u2019S COMMENTS REMAIN TO BE RESOLVED. WE HAVE ACCRUED COSTS TO PERFORM CERTAIN WORK RESPONSIVE TO EPA\u2019S COMMENTS. WE  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HAVE IMPLEMENTED MITIGATION MEASURES AND CONTINUE TO MONITOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AT THE SOMERVILLE, MASSACHUSETTS SITE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RECEIVED DEMANDS FROM THE LOCAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW MUNICIPAL TRANSIT STATION IN THE AREA OF THE SOMERVILLE SITE. THIS STATION IS PART OF THE EXTENSION OF THE TRANSIT SYSTEM. WE HAVE RESERVED FOR COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS MATTER; HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MATTER, THESE COSTS AND THE RELATED RESERVE MAY CHANGE. WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED NOTICE THAT THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IS CONDUCTING AN AUDIT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION WORK WITH RESPECT TO THE SOMERVILLE SITE.  WE ROUTINELY REVIEW AND EVALUATE SITES THAT MAY REQUIRE REMEDIATION AND MONITORING AND DETERMINE OUR ESTIMATED COSTS BASED ON VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE DEVELOPED USING OUR INTERNAL SOURCES OR BY THIRD PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERS OR OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS. INTERNALLY DEVELOPED ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON.  \u2022  MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT AND EXPERIENCE IN REMEDIATING AND MONITORING OUR SITES;  \u2022  INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM REGULATORY AGENCIES AS TO COSTS OF REMEDIATION AND MONITORING;  \u2022  THE NUMBER, FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND RELATIVE DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY OF OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (\u201cPRPS\u201d) WHO MAY BE LIABLE FOR REMEDIATION AND MONITORING OF A SPECIFIC SITE; AND  \u2022  THE TYPICAL ALLOCATION OF COSTS AMONG PRPS.  THERE IS USUALLY A RANGE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH SITE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, OUR ACCRUALS REFLECT THE AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE THAT WE BELIEVE IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OR THE LOW END OF A RANGE OF ESTIMATES IF NO POINT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE. WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT BOTH THE AMOUNT OF A PARTICULAR LIABILITY AND THE TIMING OF THE PAYMENTS ARE RELIABLY DETERMINABLE, WE ADJUST THE COST IN CURRENT DOLLARS USING A RATE OF  3%  FOR INFLATION UNTIL THE TIME OF EXPECTED PAYMENT AND DISCOUNT THE COST TO PRESENT VALUE USING CURRENT RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES. AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES WE UTILIZED RANGED FROM  3.1%  TO  3.3%.  FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCOUNTED, WE INCLUDE INTEREST ACCRETION, BASED ON THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD, IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE CHANGES TO THE AMOUNTS OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES FOR THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).

ANNUAL PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION  ARE DEPOSITED INTO AN ESCROW ACCOUNT WHICH FUNDS REMEDIATION AND MONITORING COSTS FOR  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TWO  SITES RELATED TO OUR FORMER OPERATIONS IN WILLIAMSTOWN, VERMONT. ANNUAL PROCEEDS RECEIVED BUT NOT EXPENDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR ACCUMULATE IN THIS ACCOUNT AND MAY BE USED IN FUTURE YEARS FOR COSTS RELATED TO THIS SITE THROUGH THE YEAR 2027. AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , THE BALANCE IN THIS ESCROW ACCOUNT, WHICH IS HELD IN A TRUST AND IS NOT RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.8 MILLION  . ALSO INCLUDED IN ESTIMATED INSURANCE PROCEEDS ARE AMOUNTS WE ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PURSUANT TO LEGAL SETTLEMENTS AS REIMBURSEMENTS FROM THREE INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR ESTIMATED COSTS AT THE SITE IN UVALDE, TEXAS.  OUR NUCLEAR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION FACILITIES ARE LICENSED BY THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (\u201cNRC\u201d), OR, IN CERTAIN CASES, BY THE APPLICABLE STATE AGENCY, AND ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. WE ALSO HAVE NUCLEAR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION FACILITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE NETHERLANDS. THESE FACILITIES ARE LICENSED AND REGULATED BY THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRY\u2019S APPLICABLE FEDERAL AGENCY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH REGULATION WILL NOT LEAD TO MATERIAL DISRUPTIONS IN OUR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION BUSINESS.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, CUSTOMER CONTRACT MATTERS, EMPLOYMENT CLAIMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  WHILE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO ASCERTAIN THE ULTIMATE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, INCLUDING LAWSUITS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES, WE BELIEVE THAT THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SUCH LIABILITIES, IF ANY, IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS COVERED BY INSURANCE HAVE BEEN PROPERLY ACCRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT THE FUTURE FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR FUTURE PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE CONTINGENCIES OR CHANGES OUT OF OUR CONTROL.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGULATION S-K.  SEASONALITY  HISTORICALLY, OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS HAVE VARIED FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE. THESE FLUCTUATIONS HAVE BEEN DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING: GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN OUR MARKETS; THE TIMING OF ACQUISITIONS AND OF COMMENCING START-UP OPERATIONS AND RELATED COSTS; OUR EFFECTIVENESS IN INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND START-UP OPERATIONS; THE TIMING OF NUCLEAR PLANT OUTAGES; CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; SEASONAL RENTAL AND PURCHASING PATTERNS OF OUR CUSTOMERS; AND PRICE CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS. IN ADDITION, OUR OPERATING RESULTS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN LOWER DURING THE SECOND AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS THAN DURING THE OTHER QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY HISTORICAL QUARTER ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR AN ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR OR ANY OTHER INTERIM PERIODS.  EFFECTS OF INFLATION  IN GENERAL, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON MODERATE CHANGES IN THE INFLATION RATE. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE THE IMPACTS OF MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN INFLATION RATES THROUGH OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS THAT GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR PRICE INCREASES CONSISTENT WITH THE RATE OF INFLATION, AND CONTINUED FOCUS ON IMPROVEMENTS OF OPERATIONAL PRODUCTIVITY.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  AS OF  NOVEMBER 24, 2018  , THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT WERE DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  AUGUST 25, 2018.

THESE ARE MAINLY INVENTORY, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS IN EXCESS OF BILLINGS,  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED COMMISSIONS, AND BILLINGS IN EXCESS OF COSTS AND ESTIMATED EARNINGS. THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY SOURCE OF  LIQUIDITY HAS BEEN OPERATIONS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018 WERE $326,000 COMPARED TO $737,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE COMPANY  HAS COMMITMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALING $15,000 DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. THESE COSTS ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO ACQUISITION  OF NEW EQUIPMENT USED TO TEST THE FUNCTION OF PRODUCTS PRIOR TO SHIPMENT TO CUSTOMERS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS CARRYING ADEQUATE  INSURANCE COVERAGE ON ITS FACILITIES AND THEIR CONTENTS.

APPROXIMATELY 89% OF THE CURRENT INVENTORY IS WORK  IN PROCESS, 5% IS FINISHED GOODS, AND 6% IS RAW MATERIALS.  MAINTENANCE AND OTHER INVENTORY REPRESENT STOCK  THAT IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE IN EXCESS OF TWELVE MONTHS. THIS STOCK REPRESENTS CERTAIN ITEMS THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED  TO MAINTAIN FOR SERVICE OF PRODUCTS SOLD AND ITEMS THAT ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO SPONTANEOUS ORDERING. THIS INVENTORY IS PARTICULARLY  SENSITIVE TO TECHNOLOGICAL OBSOLESCENCE IN THE NEAR TERM DUE TO ITS USE IN INDUSTRIES CHARACTERIZED BY THE CONTINUOUS INTRODUCTION  OF NEW PRODUCT LINES, RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE. MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED AN ALLOWANCE  FOR POTENTIAL INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE. THE PROVISION FOR POTENTIAL INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE WAS $85,000 AND $60,000 FOR THE SIX MONTH  PERIODS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND 2017.

AS THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FIGURE RISES IN RELATION TO THE OTHER TWO FIGURES, THE COMPANY CAN ANTICIPATE  INCREASED CASH RECEIPTS WITHIN THE ENSUING 30-60 DAYS.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $4,994,000 AS OF NOVEMBER  30, 2018 INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY $1,029,000 OF AMOUNTS RETAINED BY CUSTOMERS ON PROJECTS. IT IS EXPECTED THAT AMOUNTS RETAINED BY  CUSTOMERS UNDER CONTRACTS WILL BE RELEASED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF THE BUSINESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELATED CONTRACTS. ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE ALSO INCLUDES $110,000 OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS (\u201cALLOWANCE\u201d). THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE  AS OF MAY 31, 2018 OF $6,266,000 INCLUDED AN ALLOWANCE OF $110,000.  -  14  -  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE  NUMBER OF AN AVERAGE DAY'S SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (\u201cDSO\u201d) DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 88 DAYS AT  MAY 31, 2018 TO 47 AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  THE DSO IS A FUNCTION OF 1.) THE LEVEL OF SALES FOR AN AVERAGE DAY (FOR EXAMPLE,  TOTAL SALES FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS DIVIDED BY 90 DAYS) AND 2.) THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE  LEVEL OF SALES FOR AN AVERAGE DAY IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR IS 48% MORE THAN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE  PRIOR YEAR. THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT THE END OF THE CURRENT FISCAL QUARTER IS 20% LESS THAN THE LEVEL AT THE END OF  THE PRIOR YEAR. THE SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE COMBINED WITH THE INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF AN AVERAGE  DAY\u2019S SALES CAUSED THE DSO TO DECREASE FROM LAST YEAR END TO THIS QUARTER-END. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE DECREASE IN THE  LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM LAST YEAR END TO THIS QUARTER-END WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER BILLINGS FOR PROJECTS IN NOVEMBER 2018  ($1.2 MILLION) COMPARED TO MAY 2018 ($2.6 MILLION). THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO COLLECT THE NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE, INCLUDING  THE RETAINAGE, DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  AS NOTED ABOVE, CIEB REPRESENTS REVENUES RECOGNIZED  IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS BILLED. WHENEVER POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY NEGOTIATES A PROVISION IN SALES CONTRACTS TO ALLOW THE COMPANY TO BILL,  AND COLLECT FROM THE CUSTOMER, PAYMENTS IN ADVANCE OF SHIPMENTS. UNFORTUNATELY, SUCH PROVISIONS ARE OFTEN NOT POSSIBLE. THE $5,953,000  BALANCE IN THIS ACCOUNT AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018 IS 6% LESS THAN THE PRIOR YEAR-END BALANCE. THIS DECREASE IS THE RESULT OF NORMAL  FLOW OF THE PROJECTS THROUGH PRODUCTION WITH BILLINGS TO THE CUSTOMERS AS PERMITTED IN THE RELATED CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS  TO BILL THE ENTIRE AMOUNT DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. 19% OF THE CIEB BALANCE AS OF THE END OF THE LAST FISCAL QUARTER, AUGUST  31, 2018, WAS BILLED TO THOSE CUSTOMERS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL QUARTER ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018. THE REMAINDER WILL BE BILLED AS  THE PROJECTS PROGRESS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS SPECIFIED IN THE VARIOUS CONTRACTS.  THE BALANCES IN THIS ACCOUNT ARE COMPRISED  OF THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS.

OTHER BALANCE SHEET ITEMS  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AT $2,120,000 AS OF NOVEMBER  30, 2018, IS 45% MORE THAN THE PRIOR YEAR-END. THIS SIGNIFICANT INCREASE REFLECTS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MATERIAL PURCHASES  IN NOVEMBER 2018 OVER MAY 2018 IN ORDER TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCT FOR CUSTOMER ORDERS. COMMISSION EXPENSE ON APPLICABLE SALES ORDERS  IS RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. THE COMMISSION IS PAID FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF PAYMENT FROM THE CUSTOMERS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS SET FORTH IN  ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  , INCLUDED IN THE  2018  FORM 10-K.  26  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  AS A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED ORGANIZATION, WE MANUFACTURE, RECYCLE, AND MARKET STEEL AND METAL PRODUCTS, RELATED MATERIALS AND SERVICES THROUGH A NETWORK OF FACILITIES THAT INCLUDES  EIGHT  ELECTRIC ARC FURNACE (\"EAF\") MINI MILLS,  TWO  EAF MICRO MILLS, A REROLLING MILL, STEEL FABRICATION AND PROCESSING PLANTS, CONSTRUCTION-RELATED PRODUCT WAREHOUSES, AND METAL RECYCLING FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES (\"U.S.\") AND POLAND. OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  AMERICAS RECYCLING  ,  AMERICAS MILLS  ,  AMERICAS FABRICATION  , AND  INTERNATIONAL MILL.  FINANCIAL RESULTS OVERVIEW  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND EXCLUDES ANY RESULTS OF OUR DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)  2018  2017  NET SALES*  $1,277,342  $1,076,533  EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  19,420  31,871  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE*  0.16  0.27  *FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  OUR FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE COMPLETION OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  ON NOVEMBER 5, 2018, AS DISCUSSED IN  NOTE 2, ACQUISITION  , THE OPERATING RESULTS OF WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN OUR AMERICAS MILLS AND AMERICAS FABRICATION SEGMENTS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. NET SALES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  INCREASED  19%  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD FOR FISCAL  2018  , WITH APPROXIMATELY $121.2 MILLION OF THE INCREASE ATTRIBUTABLE TO OPERATIONS OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  .  ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN NET SALES, OUR NEW MICRO MILL IN DURANT, OKLAHOMA SHIPPED APPROXIMATELY 59 THOUSAND SHORT TONS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WITH NO COMPARABLE ACTIVITY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. CONTINUED STRENGTH IN GLOBAL DEMAND FOR STEEL HAS LED TO INCREASED MARGINS ACROSS OUR AMERICAS RECYCLING, AMERICAS MILLS AND INTERNATIONAL MILL SEGMENTS AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. OUR AMERICAS FABRICATION SEGMENT CONTINUES TO REFLECT AVERAGE SELLING PRICES THAT HAVE LAGGED BEHIND INCREASED INPUT AND PRODUCTION COSTS.  HOWEVER, NEW CONTRACT BOOKINGS INDICATE THAT PRICING IN THIS SEGMENT IS BEGINNING TO REFLECT THE INCREASED INPUT COSTS.  EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  INCLUDES CERTAIN PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  , INCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF THE ACQUIRED UNFAVORABLE CONTRACT BACKLOG.  ADDITIONALLY, INCLUDED IN OUR RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WERE CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, INCLUDING INTEGRATION EFFORTS. THESE COSTS HAVE BEEN REFLECTED IN THE RESULTS OF OUR CORPORATE AND OTHER SEGMENT.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  INCREASED  $21.1 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  , DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEES AND LEGAL EXPENSES.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  INCREASED  $10.1 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  .  THE INCREASE WAS, IN PART, A RESULT OF FINANCING ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  , INCLUDING ISSUANCE OF THE  2026 NOTES  AND A DRAW UNDER THE  2018 TERM LOAN  (BOTH DEFINED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  ), DRIVING A YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE OF $5.6 MILLION.  ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018, WAS A REDUCTION OF $3.8 MILLION IN CAPITALIZED INTEREST.  CAPITALIZED INTEREST, WHICH REDUCES INTEREST EXPENSE, WAS HIGHER IN FISCAL 2018 DUE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF OUR NEW MICRO MILL IN DURANT, OKLAHOMA, WHICH WAS PLACED IN SERVICE DURING FISCAL 2018.  27  INCOME TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AND  2017  WAS  22.4%  AND  20.9%  , RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE CURRENT PERIOD IS GREATER THAN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RECOGNITION OF MORE SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AS DISCLOSED IN  NOTE 12, INCOME TAX.  SEGMENT OPERATING DATA  UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, ALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS BELOW ARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND CALCULATED BEFORE INCOME TAXES. FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE BASIS IN WHICH WE INTERNALLY DISAGGREGATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING OPERATING DECISIONS. SEE  NOTE 17, BUSINESS SEGMENTS  . THE OPERATIONAL DATA PRESENTED IN THE TABLES BELOW IS CALCULATED USING AVERAGES; AND THEREFORE, IT IS NOT MEANINGFUL TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECT THAT ANY INDIVIDUAL COMPONENT HAD ON THE SEGMENT'S NET SALES OR ADJUSTED EBITDA.  AMERICAS RECYCLING  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2018  2017  NET SALES  $302,009  $319,341  ADJUSTED EBITDA  15,434  15,005  AVERAGE SELLING PRICE (PER SHORT TON)  FERROUS  $273  $257  NONFERROUS  1,982  2,208  SHORT TONS SHIPPED (IN THOUSANDS)  FERROUS  579  589  NONFERROUS  63  66  TOTAL  642  655  NET SALES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  DECREASED  $17.3  MILLION, OR  5%  , COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  . APPROXIMATELY 82% OF THE  DECREASE  IN NET SALES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  WAS DUE TO DECREASES IN NONFERROUS AVERAGE SELLING PRICES, AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  . SUCH DECREASE WAS THE RESULT OF A GENERAL DECLINE IN PRICING ACROSS NON-FERROUS COMMODITIES, INCLUDING COPPER AND ALUMINUM DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018.  ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  WAS RELATIVELY FLAT ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS, AS MODEST INCREASES IN AVERAGE COMBINED METAL MARGIN OF FERROUS AND NONFERROUS SCRAP WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY REDUCED SHIPMENTS, AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  ADJUSTED EBITDA INCLUDED NON-CASH STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $0.3 MILLION AND $0.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  28  AMERICAS MILLS  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2018  2017  NET SALES  $601,853  $413,518  ADJUSTED EBITDA  113,873  55,166  AVERAGE PRICE (PER SHORT TON)  TOTAL SALES  $682  $550  COST OF FERROUS SCRAP UTILIZED  307  256  METAL MARGIN  375  294  SHORT TONS (IN THOUSANDS)  MELTED  909  655  ROLLED  844  602  SHIPPED  847  677  NET SALES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  INCREASED  $188.3 MILLION  , OR  46%  , COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS DUE, IN PART, TO INCREASED SHIPMENTS OF  170  THOUSAND SHORT TONS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018, WITH THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  SHIPPING 114 THOUSAND SHORT TONS, AND OUR NEW MICRO MILL IN DURANT, OKLAHOMA SHIPPING 59 THOUSAND SHORT TONS. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASED YEAR-OVER-YEAR NET SALES WAS AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE OF  $132  PER SHORT TON, AS SELLING PRICES HAVE RISEN IN RESPONSE TO INCREASING INPUT COSTS.  ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  INCREASED  $58.7 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  , WITH THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  CONTRIBUTING  $11.6 MILLION  .  THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS DRIVEN BY METAL MARGIN EXPANSION ON REBAR AND MERCHANT PRODUCTS OF 37% AND 23%, RESPECTIVELY, COUPLED WITH INCREMENTAL SHIPMENTS FROM OUR NEW MICRO MILL IN DURANT, OKLAHOMA.  PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES IN ADJUSTED EBITDA WERE INCREASES IN CONVERSION COSTS, INCLUDING ELECTRODE AND ALLOY COSTS, TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $16 PER SHORT TON DURING THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN FISCAL  2018  . ADJUSTED EBITDA INCLUDED NON-CASH STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $1.0 MILLION AND $1.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  AMERICAS FABRICATION  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2018  2017  NET SALES  $437,111  $332,779  ADJUSTED EBITDA  (36,996  )  2,032  AVERAGE SELLING PRICE (EXCLUDING STOCK AND BUYOUT SALES) (PER SHORT TON)  REBAR AND OTHER  $868  $778  SHORT TONS SHIPPED (IN THOUSANDS)  REBAR AND OTHER  319  264  NET SALES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  INCREASED  BY  $104.3 MILLION  , OR  31%  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018, AS AVERAGE REBAR SELLING PRICES HAVE INCREASED.  SHIPMENTS IN THIS SEGMENT  INCREASED  BY  55  THOUSAND SHORT TONS, APPROXIMATELY 52 THOUSAND SHORT TONS OF WHICH WERE SHIPPED BY THE REBAR FABRICATION LOCATIONS OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  .  AMORTIZATION BENEFIT OF  $11.3 MILLION  RELATED TO THE UNFAVORABLE CONTRACT BACKLOG OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  WAS INCLUDED AS AN INCREASE TO NET SALES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  29  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , THIS SEGMENT REPORTED AN ADJUSTED EBITDA LOSS OF  $37.0 MILLION  , COMPARED TO ADJUSTED EBITDA OF  $2.0 MILLION  IN THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  .  ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY  $11.3 MILLION  OF AMORTIZATION OF UNFAVORABLE CONTRACT BACKLOG DESCRIBED ABOVE. IN ADDITION TO THESE LOSSES, THE OTHER PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS A 38% REDUCTION IN AVERAGE REBAR FABRICATION METAL MARGIN FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , DRIVEN BY THE LAG IN OUR FABRICATION PROJECT BACKLOG WHERE AVERAGE SELLING PRICES DID NOT KEEP PACE WITH INCREASING RAW MATERIAL AND CONVERSION COSTS. ADJUSTED EBITDA INCLUDED NON-CASH STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $0.6 MILLION AND $0.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  INTERNATIONAL MILL  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2018  2017  NET SALES  $227,024  $220,478  ADJUSTED EBITDA  32,779  30,944  AVERAGE PRICE (PER SHORT TON)  TOTAL SALES  $547  $517  COST OF FERROUS SCRAP UTILIZED  295  296  METAL MARGIN  252  221  SHORT TONS (IN THOUSANDS)  MELTED  392  355  ROLLED  263  336  SHIPPED  392  400  NET SALES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  INCREASED  $6.5 MILLION  , OR  3%  , COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  .  THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE WAS DRIVEN LARGELY BY INCREASED CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY AND CONTINUED ECONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS IN POLAND AND THE SURROUNDING MARKETS, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES OF  6%  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  .  SHORT TONS SHIPPED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  DECREASED  MODERATELY AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 AS A RESULT OF PLANNED DOWNTIME DURING THE FIRST QUARTER FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  ALSO REFLECTED UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACTS OF APPROXIMATELY $8.5 MILLION DUE TO THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN RELATION TO THE POLISH ZLOTY.  ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  INCREASED  6%  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  .  THE  INCREASE  IN ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  RESULTED FROM METAL MARGIN INCREASES ACROSS ALL PRODUCT LINES, RESULTING IN AN OVERALL  14%  INCREASE IN AVERAGE METAL MARGIN COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  .  ADJUSTED EBITDA INCLUDED NON-CASH STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $0.1 MILLION AND $0.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  ALSO REFLECTED UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACTS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 MILLION DUE TO THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN RELATION TO THE POLISH ZLOTY.  CORPORATE AND OTHER  CORPORATE AND OTHER REPORTED AN ADJUSTED EBITDA LOSS OF  $59.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  COMPARED TO AN ADJUSTED EBITDA LOSS OF  $23.9 MILLION  FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  . THE ADDITIONAL LOSS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018, WAS THE RESULT OF A $24.1 MILLION INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEES AND LEGAL EXPENSES.  ALSO INCLUDED IN CORPORATE AND OTHER ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS APPROXIMATELY  $9.7 MILLION  RELATED TO THE ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY PROFIT ON SHIPMENTS ACROSS SEGMENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WHILE WE BELIEVE THE LENDING INSTITUTIONS PARTICIPATING IN OUR CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS ARE FINANCIALLY CAPABLE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE BANKING AND CAPITAL MARKETS PERIODICALLY EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY THAT MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL IN A COST EFFICIENT MANNER. OUR FINANCING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RAISING CAPITAL MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES TO OUR CREDIT RATING MADE BY ANY RATING AGENCY.  30  SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR U.S. OPERATIONS HAVE ACCESS TO THE  $350.0 MILLION  CREDIT FACILITY DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  , AND AVAILABILITY UNDER THE  $200.0 MILLION  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAM DESCRIBED BELOW.  WE REGULARLY MAINTAIN A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND, BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMERS' FINANCIAL CONDITION, WE RECORD ALLOWANCES AS SOON AS WE BELIEVE ACCOUNTS ARE UNCOLLECTIBLE. CONTINUED PRESSURE ON THE LIQUIDITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES AS WE MAKE OUR ASSESSMENTS IN THE FUTURE. WE USE CREDIT INSURANCE INTERNATIONALLY TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF CUSTOMER INSOLVENCY. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT INSURED RECEIVABLES (AND THOSE COVERED BY EXPORT LETTERS OF CREDIT) WAS APPROXIMATELY  13%  OF TOTAL TRADE RECEIVABLES AT  NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  FOR ADDED FLEXIBILITY, AS NEEDED, WE MAY DRAW CASH ADVANCES UNDER THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES PROGRAMS IN THE U.S. AND POLAND. SEE  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  , FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

CASH FLOWS  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES RESULT PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF STEEL AND RELATED PRODUCTS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, SALES OF NONFERROUS METAL PRODUCTS AND OTHER RAW MATERIALS USED IN STEEL MANUFACTURING. WE HAVE A DIVERSE AND GENERALLY STABLE CUSTOMER BASE. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE USE FUTURES OR FORWARD CONTRACTS TO MITIGATE THE RISKS FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN METAL COMMODITY PRICES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, NATURAL GAS PRICES AND INTEREST RATES. SEE  NOTE 10, DERIVATIVES AND RISK MANAGEMENT  , FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  WITH THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15, CASH RECEIPTS RELATED TO THE COLLECTION OF THE DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE (\"DPP\") FROM OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS IN THE U.S. AND POLAND (THE \"PROGRAMS\"), PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WERE RECORDED AS CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , UPON ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15, COUPLED WITH AMENDMENTS MADE TO THE PROGRAMS, AS DISCUSSED IN  NOTE 6, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS  , CASH COLLECTIONS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 RELATED TO OUR OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF DPP OF  $367.5 MILLION  AT AUGUST 31, 2018 WERE REFLECTED AS CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  AS  RESULT OF THE AMENDMENTS TO THE PROGRAMS, EXCLUDING COLLECTIONS RELATED TO THE OUTSTANDING DPP BALANCE AT AUGUST 31, 2018, FUTURE CASH COLLECTIONS OF TRADE RECEIVABLES UNDER THE PROGRAMS ARE CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AND CASH ADVANCES, INCLUDING REPAYMENT OF SUCH ADVANCES, ARE CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING ACTIVITIES BEGINNING IN FISCAL  2019.  NET CASH FLOWS USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $357.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , COMPARED TO  $120.2 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017  .  THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15 DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHICH RESULTED IN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF  $367.5 MILLION  AND  $176.0 MILLION  RELATED TO CASH COLLECTIONS OF THE DPP FROM THE PROGRAMS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ASU 2016-15, THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS WAS DUE TO  DECREASED  CASH FLOWS FROM EARNINGS AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION NON-CASH CHARGES, AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  .  YEAR-OVER-YEAR CASH FLOWS FROM CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (\"WORKING CAPITAL\") FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  REFLECT A MODERATE INCREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL.  FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING  31  IMPROVED BY TWO DAYS, WHILE DAYS SALES IN INVENTORY DETERIORATED BY NINE DAYS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH FLOWS USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $379.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017  . THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR  INCREASE  IN CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  , AS DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 2, ACQUISITION  . PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS, THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15 RESULTED IN A TOTAL YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE OF  $281.6 MILLION  , INCLUDING  $191.6 MILLION  RELATED TO THE CASH COLLECTIONS OF THE DPP FROM THE PROGRAMS, AND A  $90.0 MILLION  REPAYMENT DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 OF CASH ADVANCES UNDER THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE OUTSTANDING AT AUGUST 31, 2017.  WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR FISCAL  2019  CAPITAL BUDGET WILL RANGE BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY  $175 MILLION TO $225 MILLION  . WE REGULARLY ASSESS OUR CAPITAL SPENDING AND REEVALUATE OUR REQUIREMENTS BASED ON CURRENT AND EXPECTED RESULTS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET YEAR-OVER-YEAR CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  BY  $164.7 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017  .  THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DRAW UNDER THE  2018 TERM LOAN  DURING FISCAL  2019  . THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  INCREASED  YEAR-OVER-YEAR PAYMENTS OF  $4.2 MILLION  RELATED TO REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT DURING FISCAL  2019  , INCLUDING REQUIRED MINIMUM PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERM LOANS (AS DEFINED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  ), AS WELL AS NET REPAYMENTS OF AMOUNTS DRAWN UNDER THE PROGRAMS. WE REGULARLY EVALUATE THE USE OF OUR CASH IN EFFORTS TO MAXIMIZE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, INCLUDING DEBT REPAYMENT, CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  WE ANTICIPATE OUR CURRENT CASH BALANCES, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND OUR AVAILABLE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING OUR SCHEDULED DEBT REPAYMENTS, PAYMENTS FOR OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, DIVIDENDS AND OTHER PRUDENT USES OF OUR CAPITAL, SUCH AS FUTURE ACQUISITIONS. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT OF SUSTAINED MARKET DETERIORATION, WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES AND TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL FUNDS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AT  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY  $400 MILLION  FROM  AUGUST 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  .  SUCH INCREASE INCLUDES FINANCING AND RELATED INTEREST OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  RELATED TO ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS PURCHASING ACTIVITIES. OUR ESTIMATED CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDING  NOVEMBER 30  ,  2019  ARE APPROXIMATELY  $580 MILLION  AND PRIMARILY CONSIST OF EXPENDITURES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH NORMAL REVENUE PRODUCING ACTIVITIES.  OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  WE MAINTAIN STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT OUR INSURANCE PROVIDERS AND SUPPLIERS REQUEST. AT  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , WE HAD COMMITTED  $28.3 MILLION  UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, OF WHICH  $3.3 MILLION  REDUCED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVER.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  , WE HAVE TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS IN BOTH THE U.S. AND POLAND.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, THE PROGRAMS WERE AMENDED SUCH THAT THEY NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR OFF-BALANCE SHEET TREATMENT. FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, WE ACCOUNTED FOR TRANSFERS OF THE TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS SALES: TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES TRANSFERRED WERE REMOVED FROM THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, AND CASH ADVANCES RECEIVED WERE REFLECTED AS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES ON OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

SALES IN THIS SEGMENT INCREASED DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF ITS EVO PRODUCT LINE, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN SATELLITE RADIO SALES.  YEAR OVER YEAR SALES WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY HIGHER SALES IN ITS SUBARU REMOTE START PROGRAM AND PRIVATE LABEL PRODUCTS, OFFSET BY DECLINES IN OUR AFTERMARKET HEADREST PRODUCTS.  THE DECLINES IN BOTH SATELLITE RADIO SALES AND AFTERMARKET HEADRESTS ARE THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN STANDARD FACTORY EQUIPPED VEHICLES WITH THESE OPTIONS.  SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  WERE ALSO IMPACTED BY A PRODUCT LOAD-IN FOR AN AFTERMARKET LINE IN THE PRIOR YEAR'S QUARTER WHICH DID NOT REPEAT IN FISCAL 2019.  PREMIUM AUDIO SALES REPRESENTED  38.3%  AND  35.9%  OF OUR NET SALES FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO  36.7%  AND  35.1%  IN THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. SALES DECREASED IN THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO LOWER SALES OF CERTAIN DISCONTINUED PRODUCTS INCLUDING POWERED TOWERS, DIGITAL SPEAKERS, DIGITAL SYSTEMS AND FLOOR SPEAKERS, ELIMINATION OF OVERSTOCK IN CERTAIN INVENTORY LEVELS, AS WELL AS A SHIFT IN DEMAND FROM TRADITIONAL WIRED MOBILITY PRODUCTS TO BLUETOOTH/WIRELESS SOLUTIONS.  NEW PRODUCTS FOR BLUETOOTH/WIRELESS SOLUTIONS HAVE NOT YET LAUNCHED.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN SALES IN ITS EUROPEAN MARKET AS A RESULT OF THE TIMING OF CERTAIN CUSTOMER ORDERS, AND A SHIFT IN SALES STRATEGY RELATED TO OUR E-COMMERCE CHANNEL THAT HAS TEMPORARILY DELAYED SALES.  PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE YEAR TO DATE SALES DECLINE IS THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF TWO NEW DOMESTIC PRODUCT LINES DURING FISCAL 2019.  CONSUMER ACCESSORY SALES REPRESENTED  26.7%  AND  27.2%  OF OUR NET SALES FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO  37.3%  AND  36.1%  IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THIS SEGMENT EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN SALES DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  DUE TO THE TIMING OF CUSTOMER ORDERS FOR WIRELESS AND BLUETOOTH SPEAKERS, INCLUDING LARGE LOAD-IN ORDERS OF NEW WIRELESS SPEAKER PRODUCT DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  THAT DID NOT REPEAT IN THE CURRENT YEAR, AND A STREAMLINING OF PRODUCTS AND REDUCED STORE COUNTS FOR CERTAIN RETAILERS.  ADDITIONALLY, DURING FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY LAUNCHED ITS STRIIV ACTIVITY TRACKING BANDS.  SIGNIFICANT LOAD-IN ORDERS FOR THIS PRODUCT DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  DID NOT REPEAT IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  SALES WERE ALSO IMPACTED DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  BY LOWER SALES IN THE HOME AUDIO AND RECEPTION CATEGORIES DUE TO RETAIL DISTRIBUTION CHANGES AND HIGHER LOAD IN SALES IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS.  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN SALES WITHIN ITS EUROPEAN MARKET PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN SALES STRATEGY RELATED TO OUR E-COMMERCE CHANNEL THAT HAS TEMPORARILY DELAYED SALES, AS WELL AS SALES OF EQUIPMENT AND SET TOP BOXES RELATED TO A DIGITAL BROADCASTING UPGRADE  IN THE PRIOR YEAR THAT DID NOT REPEAT IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  OFFSETTING THESE DECREASES WERE HIGHER SALES OF KARAOKE PRODUCTS, SPECIFICALLY THE NEW SINGSATION LINE, AS WELL AS INCREASES IN SALES FROM ADDITIONAL PLACEMENTS AND HIGHER DIRECT IMPORT SALES OF OUR PROJECT NURSERY PRODUCTS, THE INTRODUCTION OF OUR NEW SMART HOME LINE, AND HIGHER SALES OF SECURITY PRODUCTS DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  .  DUE TO THE ONGOING SALES DECLINES IN THIS SEGMENT AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS AND CHANGES IN RETAIL DISTRIBUTION, IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , THE COMPANY BEGAN AN AGGRESSIVE SKU RATIONALIZATION PROGRAM TO LIMIT SALES OF LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS AND RESTRUCTURED ITS CONSUMER ACCESSORIES SEGMENT.

GROSS PROFITS INCREASED IN THIS SEGMENT DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS AS A RESULT OF OUR NEW EVO PRODUCT SALES. GROSS MARGINS INCREASED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN PRODUCTION RELATED COST-CUTTING MEASURES, LOWER TOOLING COSTS, AND LOWER INVENTORY RESERVE REQUIREMENTS.  A DECLINE IN SALES OF AFTERMARKET PRODUCTS FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON MARGINS FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT.

GROSS MARGINS IN THE PREMIUM AUDIO SEGMENT WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY A SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX INCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION OF OUR NEW REFERENCE AND REFERENCE PREMIER LINES, AND A DECLINE IN SALES OF LOWER MARGINED MOBILITY AND SOUND SYSTEM PRODUCTS IN THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS.  DURING THESE PERIODS, OUR MARGINS WERE ALSO FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY A DECLINE IN SALES FROM OUR EUROPEAN MARKET WHICH HAS HAD A HIGHER CONCENTRATION OF LOWER MARGINED PRODUCT.  MARGINS FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  WERE ALSO POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY THE ABSENCE OF SALES OF DISCONTINUED POWERED FLOORSTANDING SPEAKERS INCLUDED IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.

DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , MARGINS WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY A DECREASE IN SALES OF THE COMPANY'S STRIIV ACTIVITY TRACKING BAND WHICH HAD GENERATED LOWER MARGINS FOR THIS SEGMENT.  IN OUR EUROPEAN MARKET, CURRENT YEAR TO DATE MARGINS WERE IMPACTED BY THE ABSENCE OF LOWER MARGINED DIGITAL RECEPTION PRODUCT SALES AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AS WELL AS THE CURRENT YEAR INCREASE IN SALES IN OUR ONLINE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL.

SELLING EXPENSES ARE DOWN FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO VARIOUS COST-CUTTING MEASURES INCLUDING HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS, LOWER ADVERTISING COSTS, ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR TRADE SHOW PARTICIPATION, AND LOWER TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES.  OFFSETTING THESE DECLINES WAS AN INCREASE IN ONLINE PLATFORM FEES, INCLUDING A TERMINATION CHARGE FOR A DISCONTINUED PLATFORM AFFECTING THE YEAR TO DATE PERIOD.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PROFESSIONAL FEES, BONUS ACCRUALS AND INCENTIVES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PROFESSIONAL FEES RELATED TO TAX REFORM.  PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE DOWN DURING THE QUARTER DUE TO THE REIMBURSEMENT OF LEGAL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH A COUNTERFEIT LAWSUIT.  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECLINED DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF BONUS ACCRUALS RELATED TO THE SALE OF HIRSCHMANN, REIMBURSEMENT OF LEGAL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH A COUNTERFEIT LAWSUIT, AND LEGAL FEES FOR A PATENT LAWSUIT RECORDED IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  IN ADDITION, EXPENSES ARE DOWN IN THE CURRENT NINE-MONTH PERIOD DUE TO COST CUTTING EFFORTS RELATED TO HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS, TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT, AND VARIOUS OTHER GENERAL OFFICE EXPENSES.  ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  WERE IN LINE WITH THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , EXPENSES WERE DOWN DUE TO DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR OUR NEW EVO PRODUCT AND CERTAIN SEVERANCE COSTS BOTH RECORDED IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AND A DECLINE IN TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  THESE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN HEALTHCARE COSTS AND A RESTRUCTURING CHARGE FOR OUR GERMAN OPERATION.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY RE-EVALUATED ITS PROJECTIONS FOR SEVERAL BRANDS IN ITS CONSUMER ACCESSORY AND AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENTS BASED ON LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED RESULTS DUE TO LOWER PRODUCT LOAD-INS, INCREASED COMPETITION FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT LINES, A STREAMLINING OF SKU\u2019S, AND ITS MARKETING STRATEGY FOR ONE OF ITS BRANDS.  AS A RESULT OF THIS EVALUATION, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT SEVERAL OF ITS TRADEMARKS WERE IMPAIRED RESULTING IN A TOTAL CHARGE OF  $9,814  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018.

THE DECREASE IN THESE EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY DID NOT CARRY AN OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON ITS CREDIT FACILITY IN THESE PERIODS AFTER REPAYING THE ENTIRE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE CREDIT FACILITY FOLLOWING THE SALE OF HIRSCHMANN ON AUGUST 31, 2017.  EQUITY IN INCOME OF EQUITY INVESTEE REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF INCOME FROM ITS 50% NON-CONTROLLING OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN ASA ELECTRONICS LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES (\"ASA\"). THIS INCOME DECREASED FOR BOTH THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF HIGHER TOOLING COSTS FOR CERTAIN R&D PROJECTS, HIGHER LEGAL EXPENSES, AND A CHANGE IN PRODUCT AMORTIZATION EXPENSES, AS WELL AS DUE TO THE LIQUIDATION AND SELL THROUGH OF CERTAIN SLOW MOVING INVENTORY STOCK.  DURING JULY 2017, ONE OF THE COMPANY'S COST METHOD INVESTEES, RXNETWORKS, WAS SOLD TO A THIRD PARTY, RESULTING IN AN INVESTMENT GAIN RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  , REPRESENTING THE EXCESS OF THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED FOR THE INVESTMENT HELD BY THE COMPANY ON THE DATE OF THE TRANSACTION.  THE COMPANY HAS CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS IN VENEZUELA, WHICH ARE HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY MADE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE PROPERTIES AS A RESULT OF THE COUNTRY'S CONTINUED ECONOMIC DETERIORATION, WHICH INCLUDED A SIGNIFICANT CURRENCY DEVALUATION IN AUGUST OF 2018. THE COMPANY RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE AS A RESULT OF THIS ASSESSMENT REPRESENTING THE REMAINING BALANCE OF THESE PROPERTIES.  OTHER, NET PRIMARILY INCLUDES NET FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS OR LOSSES, INTEREST INCOME AND RENTAL INCOME.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , OTHER, NET DECLINED DUE TO A DECLINE IN INCOME FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING OF PRODUCT PURCHASES.  THIS DECLINE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME ON NEW INVESTMENTS WHICH IMPACTED BOTH THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  .  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  , THE COMPANY RECORDED A FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSS OF  $(6,618)  ON FORWARD CONTRACTS USED TO HEDGE THE SALE OF OUR HIRSCHMANN OPERATIONS (SEE NOTE 2).  INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  ON AUGUST 31, 2017, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS SALE OF HIRSCHMANN TO A SUBSIDIARY OF TE. THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY WAS \u20ac  148,500  . THE PURCHASE PRICE, AT THE EXCHANGE RATE AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON AUGUST 31, 2017, APPROXIMATED  $177,000  AND IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT BASED UPON THE FINAL WORKING CAPITAL. FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  , INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF A GAIN ON SALE OF  $36,118  , AS WELL AS OPERATING (LOSS) INCOME OF  $(12)  AND  $2,828  , RESPECTIVELY. OPERATING INCOME FOR THE COMPANY'S DISCONTINUED OPERATION FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  WAS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF TUNER AND ANTENNA SALES. FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , THERE WAS  NO  INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, AS ALL SALES AND OPERATIONS RELATING TO THE DISCONTINUED OPERATION CEASED FOLLOWING THE SALE OF HIRSCHMANN ON AUGUST 31, 2017.  INCOME TAX PROVISION  43  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  WAS AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF  62.8%  ON PRE-TAX INCOME OF  $6,491  , AND AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF  27.8%  ON A PRE-TAX LOSS OF  $(11,338)  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF  8.2%  ON PRE-TAX INCOME OF  $6,909  , AND AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF  23.1%  ON A PRE-TAX LOSS OF  $(19,586)  , IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  DIFFERS FROM THE STATUTORY RATE OF  21%  PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST RELATED TO EYELOCK LLC, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES, NONDEDUCTIBLE PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, AND INCOME TAXED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AT VARYING TAX RATES. IN ADDITION, THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE INCREASED FOR U.S. TAX CREDITS AND LOSSES IN CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH A LIMITED TAX BENEFIT CAN BE RECOGNIZED.  THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 IS A NEGATIVE 40.5%. THE CALCULATION OF THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS BASED ON OUR ANNUAL PRETAX INCOME FORECAST WHICH INCLUDES PROFITABLE JURISDICTIONS ANTICIPATING AN INCOME TAX PROVISION AND LOSS JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH A LIMITED TAX BENEFIT CAN BE RECOGNIZED. THE MIX OF THE JURISDICTIONS PRODUCES A NEGATIVE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WHICH RESULTS IN AN INCOME TAX PROVISION WHEN APPLIED TO THE PRETAX LOSS FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  . IF THE ANNUAL PRETAX INCOME FORECAST IS ACHIEVED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FISCAL YEAR, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES RECOGNIZING AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017  DIFFERED FROM THE STATUTORY RATE OF  35%  PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT FOR DOMESTIC LOSSES, AS THE U.S. TAXABLE INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IS TREATED AS A SOURCE OF INCOME UNDER THE INTRA-PERIOD ALLOCATION GUIDANCE, COUPLED WITH THE MIX OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN EARNINGS, THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST RELATED TO EYELOCK LLC, AND AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO VARIOUS FEDERAL TAX CREDITS.  EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE  EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE ARE NOT FINANCIAL MEASURES RECOGNIZED BY GAAP. EBITDA REPRESENTS NET (LOSS) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO VOXX INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE AND BANK CHARGES, TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. ADJUSTED EBITDA REPRESENTS EBITDA ADJUSTED FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, GAINS ON THE SALE OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, LOSSES ON CERTAIN FORWARD CONTRACTS, AND INVESTMENT GAINS. DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE NON-CASH ITEMS. DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BASED ON ADJUSTED EBITDA.  WE PRESENT EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE IN THIS FORM 10-Q BECAUSE WE CONSIDER THEM TO BE USEFUL AND APPROPRIATE SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF OUR PERFORMANCE. ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE HELP US TO EVALUATE OUR PERFORMANCE WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN GAAP CALCULATIONS THAT MAY NOT HAVE A DIRECT CASH IMPACT ON OUR CURRENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN COSTS OR GAINS RELATING TO NON-RECURRING EVENTS ALLOWS FOR A MORE MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF OUR RESULTS FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD. THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, AS WE DEFINE THEM, ARE NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY ENTITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES AND MAY NOT BE AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE FOR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO OTHER COMPANIES. EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE SHOULD NOT BE ASSESSED IN ISOLATION FROM, ARE NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE MORE MEANINGFUL MEASURES THAN, OR ALTERNATIVES TO, MEASURES OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED CASH OF  $10,105  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED COLLECTIONS ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WHICH WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY EXPECTED HOLIDAY SEASON SALES ACTIVITY, INCREASES IN SALES INCENTIVES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, WHICH WERE OFFSET BY INCREASE IN INVENTORY AND A DECREASE IN ACCRUED EXPENSES.

GENERAL AND HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS  THE COMPANY WAS FORMED ON DECEMBER 9, 2004 UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEVADA AS AN INDEPENDENT OIL AND GAS COMPANY ENGAGED IN THE EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. IN MARCH OF 2014, THE COMPANY BEGAN ITS ENTRY INTO THE BIOSCIENCE AND ALTERNATIVE HEALTH AND WELLNESS BUSINESS AND DISCONTINUED ITS INVOLVEMENT IN THE OIL AND GAS BUSINESS IN NOVEMBER 2014. IN MAY 2016, THE COMPANY ALSO COMMENCED OUT-LICENSING ITS PATENTED TECHNOLOGY FOR IMPROVED DELIVERY OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS THAT PROMOTES HEALTHY INGESTION METHODS, LOWER OVERALL DOSING AND HIGHER EFFECTIVENESS IN ACTIVE MOLECULE DELIVERY. THE COMPANY HAS ITS OFFICE IN KELOWNA, BC, CANADA.  EFFECTIVE AT THE OPENING OF TRADING ON OCTOBER 28, 2009, OUR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK BEGAN TRADING ON THE CANADIAN SECURITIES EXCHANGE (FORMERLY, CANADIAN NATIONAL STOCK EXCHANGE) UNDER THE TRADING SYMBOL \u201cLXX\u201d.  OUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON THE OTCQX UNDER THE SYMBOL \u201cLXRP\u201d AND ON THE CANADIAN SECURITIES EXCHANGE UNDER THE SYMBOL \u201cLXX\u201d.  IN 2014, THE COMPANY SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION TO ENTER THE LEGAL MEDICAL MARIJUANA BUSINESS IN CANADA AND ALSO LAUNCHED A HEMP OIL-BASED FOOD SUPPLEMENT COMPANY IN THE USA.  17  THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT WITH ENERTOPIA CORP FOR A PROSPECTIVE MEDICAL MARIJUANA BUSINESS UNDER THE CANADIAN MARIJUANA FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES REGULATIONS (\u201cMMPR\u201d) FOR A 49% NET OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS (ENERTOPIA 51%) UTILIZING AN IDENTIFIED LOCATION IN BURLINGTON, ONTARIO.  ON JUNE 26, 2015, WE ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH ENERTOPIA CORP. AND SHAXON ENTERPRISES LTD. TO SELL OUR 49% INTEREST IN THE BURLINGTON JOINT VENTURE AND THE MMPR APPLICATION NUMBER 10MMPR0610. PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT, THE JOINT VENTURE RECEIVED A NON-REFUNDABLE $10,000 DEPOSIT AND IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE UP TO $1,500,000 IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS UPON THE BURLINGTON FACILITY BECOMING LICENSED UNDER THE MMPR. ALL PAYMENTS MADE PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT WOULD BE DIVIDED 51% TO ENERTOPIA CORP. AND 49% TO OUR COMPANY. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, WE CAN NEITHER GUARANTEE NOR PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL TIME ESTIMATE REGARDING THE GRANT OF A PRODUCTION LICENSE FOR THE BURLINGTON FACILITY.  THE COMPANY\u2019S FOOD SCIENCES ACTIVITIES INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PROPRIETARY NUTRIENT INFUSION TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FUNCTIONAL FOODS, AND THE PRODUCTION OF ENHANCED FOOD PRODUCTS UNDER OUR CONSUMER PRODUCT BRANDS, VIPOVATM, LEXARIA ENERGYTM AND CHRGD+  TM  . THE COMPANY\u2019S PATENTED LIPID NUTRIENT INFUSION TECHNOLOGY DEHYDRATECH  TM  IS BELIEVED TO IMPROVE TASTE, RAPIDITY AND DELIVERY OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS THAT INCLUDE CANNABINOIDS, VITAMINS, NSAIDS, NICOTINE AND OTHER MOLECULES COMPARED TO WHAT IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT LIPOPHILIC ENHANCEMENT TECHNOLOGY. THIS CAN ALLOW FOR LOWER OVERALL DOSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR HIGHER EFFECTIVENESS IN ACTIVE MOLECULE DELIVERY.  WE BEGAN FILING PATENT APPLICATIONS ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DURING 2015 THROUGH THE US PATENT OFFICE (USPTO), AND ALSO INTERNATIONALLY UNDER THE PATENT COOPERATION TREATY (PCT). WE WERE GRANTED OUR FIRST PATENT IN OCTOBER OF 2016 AND TO DATE HAVE BEEN GRANTED SIX PATENTS THROUGH THE USPTO AND TWO IN AUSTRALIA.  LEXARIA HOPES TO REDUCE OTHER COMMON BUT LESS HEALTHY ADMINISTRATION METHODS, SUCH AS SMOKING, AS IT EMBRACES THE BENEFITS OF ITS TECHNOLOGY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. THE COMPANY IS AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING PATENT PROTECTION IN NATIONAL JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS MORE THAN 50 PATENT APPLICATIONS PENDING WORLDWIDE AND, DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF PURSUING PATENT PROTECTION, THE QUANTITY OF PATENT APPLICATIONS WILL VARY CONTINUOUSLY AS EACH APPLICATION ADVANCES OR STALLS. LEXARIA IS ALSO FILING NEW PATENT APPLICATIONS FOR NOVEL NEW DISCOVERIES THAT ARISE FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S R&D PROGRAMS AND, DUE TO THE INHERENT UNPREDICTABILITY OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT IF OR HOW OFTEN SUCH NEW APPLICATIONS MIGHT BE FILED.  AS AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TWO REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSING AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS.  WE MAINTAIN OUR REGISTERED AGENT\u2019S OFFICE AND OUR U.S. BUSINESS OFFICE AT NEVADA AGENCY AND TRANSFER COMPANY, 50 WEST LIBERTY, SUITE 880, RENO, NEVADA 89501. OUR TELEPHONE NUMBER IS (755) 322-0626.  THE ADDRESS OF OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICE IS 156 VALLEYVIEW RD, KELOWNA BC CANADA V1X3M4. WE HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS LOCATED IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA. SUBSEQUENT TO NOVEMBER 30, 2018, OUR OFFICES WILL BE MOVING TO UNIT 100 \u2013 740 MCCURDY ROAD, KELOWNA BC V1X2P7 WITH THE ANTICIPATED OPENING DATE FOR THE NEW OFFICES DURING FIRST QUARTER OF CALENDAR 2019.  OUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON THE OTCQX UNDER THE SYMBOL \u201cLXRP\u201d AND ON THE CANADIAN SECURITIES EXCHANGE UNDER THE SYMBOL \u201cLXX\u201d.  DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF BRITISH COLUMBIA INSTRUMENT 51-509 ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2008, BY THE BRITISH COLUMBIA SECURITIES COMMISSION, WE HAVE BEEN DEEMED TO BE A BRITISH COLUMBIA BASED REPORTING ISSUER. AS SUCH, WE ARE REQUIRED TO FILE CERTAIN INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTS AT WWW.SEDAR.COM.  18  OUR CURRENT BUSINESS  OUR COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS PLAN IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WITH LICENSEES FOR OUR PATENTED TECHNOLOGY IN EXCHANGE FOR UP FRONT AND/OR STAGED LICENSING FEES OVER TIME. SECONDARILY AND MORE GENERALLY, WE CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ENHANCED FUNCTIONAL FOOD AND SUPPLEMENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS; TO INVESTIGATE EXPANSIONS AND ADDITIONS TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO; AND, TO SEARCH FOR ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN ALTERNATIVE HEALTH SECTORS. THIS INCLUDES THE ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IF AND WHEN WE BELIEVE IT ADVISABLE TO DO SO.  OUR CURRENT PATENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES PATENT FAMILY GRANTS RELATING TO: INFUSED FOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF, PERTAINING TO LEXARIA\u2019S METHOD OF IMPROVING BIOAVAILABILITY AND TASTE, AND THE USE OF DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY AS A DELIVERY PLATFORM FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS (\u201cAPIS\u201d) ENCOMPASSING ALL CANNABINOIDS INCLUDING THC; FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS; NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PAIN MEDICATIONS (\u201cNSAIDS\u201d); AND NICOTINE.

TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE AND PROFITABLE GROWTH, OUR COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTROL THE TIMING AND COSTS OF OUR PROJECTS WHEREVER POSSIBLE. WE HAVE FILED FOR PATENT PROTECTION OF OUR DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY FOR ADDITIONAL COMPOUNDS SUCH AS PHOSPHODIESTERASE INHIBITORS, HUMAN HORMONES SUCH AS ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTERONE, AND MORE.  DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, AND UP TO THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, WE EXPERIENCED THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS.  ON SEPTEMBER 7, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ADDITIONS TO ITS PATENT PORTFOLIO. THREE NEW AUSTRALIAN PATENTS WERE GRANTED TO LEXARIA BY THE AUSTRALIAN PATENT OFFICE, BRINGING THE COMPANY\u2019S WORLDWIDE PATENT PORTFOLIO TO EIGHT ISSUED PATENTS: FOUR EACH IN THE US AND AUSTRALIA. ALL EIGHT PATENTS ARE WITHIN LEXARIA\u2019S FIRST PATENT FAMILY, \u201cFOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS INFUSED WITH LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\u201d, AND SIGNIFICANTLY STRENGTHEN LEXARIA\u2019S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS IN THE US AND AUSTRALIA. THE THREE NEW AUSTRALIAN PATENTS ARE PROJECTED TO EXPIRE ON JUNE 10, 2035.  THE US PATENT & TRADEMARK OFFICE ALSO ISSUED TWO NEW NOTICES OF ALLOWANCE FOR PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE CORRESPONDING US ISSUED PATENTS PRIOR TO YEAR-END 2018. THE COMPANY IS CONCURRENTLY PURSUING ACCELERATED EXAMINATION IN AUSTRALIA BASED ON THESE US NOTICES OF ALLOWANCE AND EXPECTS TWO NEW AUSTRALIAN PATENTS TO ALSO BE ISSUED PRIOR TO YEAR-END 2018. IF ISSUED IN BOTH THE US AND AUSTRALIA, THE COMPANY WILL THEN HOLD TWELVE ISSUED PATENTS WITHIN ITS FIRST PATENT FAMILY AND CONTINUES TO PURSUE CLAIMS IN CORRESPONDING PENDING APPLICATIONS WITHIN THIS FIRST PATENT FAMILY AROUND THE WORLD. LEXARIA HAS NOW FILED A TOTAL OF OVER 50 PATENT APPLICATIONS ACROSS NINE CURRENT PATENT FAMILIES.  19  ON SEPTEMBER 7, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE FILING OF A NEW STRATEGIC PATENT APPLICATION. THE NEW PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION IS ENTITLED \u201cLIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENT INFUSED TOBACCO LEAVES AND/OR TOBACCO MATERIALS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\u201d. THIS APPLICATION REPRESENTS LEXARIA\u2019S TENTH PATENT FAMILY AND EXPANDS THE APPLICABILITY OF THE ALREADY-PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGICAL PROCESS TO IMPART BENEFITS TO TOBACCO LEAVES THAT MAY BE UTILIZED TO DELIVER COMPOUNDS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT INCLUDE NICOTINE.  LEXARIA ALSO ANNOUNCED IT CANCELLED THE CONTRACT ANNOUNCED ON APRIL 25, 2018 WITH GP HOLDINGS LLC DUE TO ONGOING DELAYS AND NON-PERFORMANCE.  ON OCTOBER 10, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT HAS COMPLETED THE CREATION OF FOUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES. THIS NEW CORPORATE STRUCTURE MORE SUITABLY REFLECTS THE DISTINCT CUSTOMER BASES AND BUSINESS APPLICATIONS FOR EACH SUBSIDIARY, THEREBY ALLOWING THE COMPANY TO FOCUS ITS FUTURE RESEARCH AND CONSIDER FINANCING STRUCTURES AND INDUSTRY PARTNERSHIPS SPECIFICALLY OPTIMIZED TO EACH.  \u00b7  LEXARIA CANPHARM CORP., A CANADIAN COMPANY FOCUSED ON PROVIDING DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER ENHANCEMENTS TO THE GLOBAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY.  \u00b7  LEXARIA NICOTINE CORP., A US COMPANY WITH A GLOBAL LICENSE TO PROVIDE DEHYDRATECH TECHNOLOGY TO THE GLOBAL NICOTINE AND TOBACCO INDUSTRIES.  \u00b7  LEXARIA HEMP CORP., A US COMPANY GLOBALLY LICENSED TO PROVIDE DEHYDRATECH TO THE RAPIDLY GROWING HEMP-BASED FOODS AND SUPPLEMENTS INDUSTRIES.  \u00b7  LEXARIA PHARMACEUTICAL CORP., A US COMPANY GLOBALLY EMPOWERED TO LICENSE DEHYDRATECH TO THE LARGE AND DIVERSE PHARMACEUTICAL SECTORS.  ON OCTOBER 16, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT WAS GRANTED TWO NEW US PATENTS. LEXARIA NOW HAS SIX GRANTED PATENTS IN THE US AND FOUR GRANTED PATENTS IN AUSTRALIA. ALL TEN OF THESE PATENTS ARE WITHIN LEXARIA\u2019S FIRST PATENT FAMILY, \u201cFOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS INFUSED WITH LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\u201d. SPECIFICALLY, THE TWO NEW PATENTS ARE RELATED TO CERTAIN CANNABINOID INFUSED BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS UTILIZING LEXARIA\u2019S PROPRIETARY DEHYDRATECH PROCESS. NEWLY GRANTED PATENT NUMBERS US 10,103,225 B2 AND US 10,084,044 B2 PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR COMPOSITIONS AS WELL AS METHODS FOR MAKING THE COMPOSITIONS, EACH OF WHICH INCLUDE THE USE OF BOTH NON-PSYCHOACTIVE CANNABINOIDS SUCH AS CBD AND ALSO PSYCHOACTIVE CANNABINOIDS SUCH AS THC.  ON OCTOBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY CLOSED A NON-BROKERED PRIVATE PLACEMENT FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF $1,515,440 (THE \u201cOFFERING\u201d). THE OFFERING CONSISTED OF 947,150 UNITS (EACH, A \u201cUNIT\u201d) AT AN ISSUE PRICE OF $1.60 PER UNIT. EACH UNIT CONSISTS OF ONE COMMON SHARE OF THE COMPANY (A \u201cSHARE\u201d) AND ONE COMMON SHARE PURCHASE WARRANT (EACH, A \u201cWARRANT\u201d). EACH WARRANT ENTITLES THE HOLDER TO ACQUIRE ONE COMMON SHARE OF THE COMPANY AT A PRICE OF $2.25 PER COMMON SHARE FOR A PERIOD OF 24 MONTHS FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE OFFERING. FINDER\u2019S FEES OF $45,080 AND 28,175 FINDER\u2019S WARRANTS WERE PAID ON A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS RAISED, WITH EACH FINDER\u2019S WARRANT HAVING EXERCISE TERMS IDENTICAL TO THE WARRANTS ISSUED. THE WARRANTS WERE VALUED AT $16,095, WHICH WERE RECORDED AS A SHARE ISSUE COST WITHIN ADDITIONAL PAID IN CAPITAL FOR A NET EFFECT OF $NIL.  ON NOVEMBER 13, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE LAUNCH OF CHRGD+, A WATER-SOLUBLE, READY-MIX HEMP SUPPLEMENT POWDER PACKET FORMULATION DESIGNED TO BE ADDED TO ANY DRINK. LEXARIA ENGAGED CULTIVATING WELLNESS INC., A CALIFORNIA-BASED BRAND DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANY, TO CREATE THE CHRGD+ PREMIUM BRAND. CULTIVATING WELLNESS\u2019 DISTRIBUTION NETWORK REACHES TENS OF THOUSANDS OF RETAIL BUYERS IN C-STORES, GROCERY CHAINS, SPECIALTY RETAIL, AND NATIONAL ACCOUNTS.  ON NOVEMBER 26, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT SUBMITTED A RESEARCH APPLICATION UNDER HEALTH CANADA\u2019S CANNABIS TRACKING AND LICENSING SYSTEM FOR THE OPERATION OF A KELOWNA-BASED R&D LABORATORY WITHIN LEXARIA\u2019S NEW HEAD OFFICE. THE LABORATORY WILL ENHANCE LEXARIA\u2019S ABILITY TO FORMULATE FOR ANALYTICAL PURPOSES, VARIOUS PRODUCTS THAT MAY CONTAIN CANNABINOIDS OR OTHER CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES. LEXARIA EXPECTS TO WORK ON CANNABINOID RELATED FORMULATIONS AS SOON AS THE LAB RECEIVES ITS RESEARCH LICENSE TO DO SO. EXPERIMENTAL WORK ON NICOTINE FORMULATIONS, NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS, VITAMINS AND OTHER BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS OF INTEREST WILL ALSO BEGIN SOON AFTER COMPLETION OF LAB CONSTRUCTION. BRINGING THIS WORK IN-HOUSE IS EXPECTED TO ENABLE THE COMPANY TO EXPAND ITS WORK SCHEDULES WHILE REDUCING COSTS AND DEVELOPMENT TIMELINES. LEXARIA ALSO APPOINTED DR. ED ERGENZINGER TO ITS EXECUTIVE TEAM AS CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER AND SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF INNOVATION FOR THE COMPANY. DR. ERGENZINGER IS A U.S. LICENSED PATENT ATTORNEY WHO ALSO HOLDS A DOCTORATE IN NEUROSCIENCE (WITH CONCENTRATIONS IN PHARMACOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY) AND IS AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR OF LAW.  20  FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE SHARE ISSUANCES AND RELATED VALUES.

ON NOVEMBER 11, 2014, OUR COMPANY ACQUIRED 51% OF POVIVA TEA LLC AND EXECUTED AN OPERATING AGREEMENT TO DEVELOP A BUSINESS OF LEGALLY PRODUCING, MANUFACTURING, IMPORTING/EXPORTING, TESTING, RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING, A LINE OF HEMP OIL WITH CANNABIDIOL-INFUSED TEAS, DRINKS AND FOODS. LEXARIA OVERSEES ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRODUCTION, PRODUCT QUALITY, LICENSING, TESTING, PRODUCT LEGALITY, ACCOUNTING, MARKETING, CAPITAL INVESTMENT, CAPITAL RAISING, SALES, BRANDING, ADVERTISING AND FULFILLMENT. PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT, THERE IS A MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, WHEREBY THERE ARE TWO REPRESENTATIVES FROM LEXARIA AND ONE OF THE FOUNDING MEMBERS OF POVIVA. ON NOVEMBER 2, 2017, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE ACQUIRED 100% OF POVIVA TEA LLC.  THE COMPANY INTRODUCED AN EXPANDING VARIETY OF HEMP FORTIFIED CONSUMER FOOD PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT 2015 TO DEMONSTRATE LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY TO BOTH CONSUMERS AND POTENTIAL LICENSEES. FROM JANUARY 2015 TO DECEMBER 2015, SEVEN (7) FLAVORS OF TEAS; HOT CHOCOLATE; COFFEE, AND TWO (2) FLAVORS OF PROTEIN ENERGY BARS WERE INTRODUCED \u2013 ALL UTILIZING LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED TECHNOLOGY DEHYDRATECH  TM  FOR THE MORE PALATABLE AND EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF BIOACTIVE MOLECULES INFUSED WITHIN THOSE FOOD PRODUCTS.  IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE PRODUCTS, FOR EACH RAW MATERIAL TO BE USED IN VIPOVATM -BRANDED PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY ASSESSES IF THE PRODUCT INPUTS AND THE COMPLETED PRODUCTS COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE FOOD AND DRUG LAWS, AND THAT THE INPUTS AND THE FINISHED PRODUCTS MEET ALL APPLICABLE LEGAL AND QUALITY STANDARDS INCLUDING AND AS IT RELATES TO HEMP OIL CONTENT; THC CONTENT; MOLDS AND MILDEWS; HEAVY METALS; AND MAY MEASURE ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS.  THE US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THROUGH THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, OWNS US PATENT #6630507, WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS, CLAIMS THAT  \u201c  CANNABINOIDS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO HAVE ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES, UNRELATED TO NMDA RECEPTOR ANTAGONISM. THIS NEW FOUND PROPERTY MAKES CANNABINOIDS USEFUL IN THE TREATMENT AND PROPHYLAXIS OF WIDE VARIETY OF OXIDATION ASSOCIATED DISEASES, SUCH AS ISCHEMIC, AGE-RELATED, INFLAMMATORY AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. THE CANNABINOIDS ARE FOUND TO HAVE PARTICULAR APPLICATION AS NEUROPROTECTANTS, FOR EXAMPLE IN LIMITING NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE FOLLOWING ISCHEMIC INSULTS, SUCH AS STROKE AND TRAUMA, OR IN THE TREATMENT OF NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES, SUCH AS ALZHEIMER\u2019S DISEASE, PARKINSON\u2019S DISEASE AND HIV DEMENTIA.\u201d  21  FOR REFERENCE, CANNABINOIDS ARE COMPOUNDS THAT AFFECT CANNABINOID RECEPTORS LOCATED ON MANY HUMAN CELLS. CB1 RECEPTORS ARE WIDELY FOUND WITHIN THE HUMAN BRAIN; AND CB2 RECEPTORS ARE FOUND WITH THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM AND HAVE BEEN LINKED TO ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND OTHER RESPONSES.  DESPITE INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS IN MANY LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, SOME REGULATORY AGENCIES DO NOT OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZE THAT A HUMAN ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM EXISTS.  OVER ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT CANNABINOIDS HAVE BEEN ISOLATED FROM THE CANNABIS PLANT, MOST OF WHICH DO NOT HAVE PSYCHOACTIVE PROPERTIES. ONE THAT DOES HAVE PSYCHOACTIVE PROPERTIES IS TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL (THC). ENDOCANNABINOIDS ARE PRODUCED NATURALLY IN THE HUMAN BODY WHILE PHYTOCANNABINOIDS ARE PRODUCED IN SEVERAL PLANT SPECIES, MOST ABUNDANTLY IN THE CANNABIS PLANT.  CANNABIDIOL (\u201cCBD\u201d) IS ONE OF THE MAJOR PHYTOCANNABINOID FORMS OF CANNABINOIDS AND IS NOT PSYCHOACTIVE, OFTEN CONTRIBUTING MORE THAN 35% OF THE EXTRACTS FROM THE CANNABIS PLANT RESIN. CANNABIDIOL OCCURS NATURALLY IN OTHER PLANT SPECIES BEYOND CANNABIS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MOST WIDELY ACKNOWLEDGED ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF PHYTOCANNABINOID IS IN THE BETTER UNDERSTOOD ECHINACEA SPECIES, IN WIDESPREAD USE AS A DIETARY SUPPLEMENT. MOST PHYTOCANNABINOIDS ARE VIRTUALLY INSOLUBLE IN WATER BUT ARE SOLUBLE IN LIPIDS AND ALCOHOL. THE WORLD ANTI DOPING AGENCY (\u201cWADA\u201d) HAS EXEMPTED CBD FROM ITS 2018 LIST OF BANNED SUBSTANCES.  THE ALTERNATIVE HEALTH SECTOR IS LARGE AND GROWING. A LONG TERM MEDICAL EXPENDITURE PANEL SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED FROM 2002 UNTIL 2008 WITH AT LEAST 29,370 SUBJECTS ASKED REPEATEDLY IF THEY HAD SEEN ANY KIND OF HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER IN THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS. THE SURVEY RECORDED WHETHER THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WAS A \u201cCOMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE CARE PROFESSIONAL,\u201d INCLUDING \u201cHOMEOPATHIC, NATUROPATHIC, OR HERBALIST.\u201d  BETWEEN 5.3% AND 5.8% OF THE SURVEY GROUP AT ANY ONE TIME REPORTED THAT THEY HAD SEEN A COMPLEMENTARY OR ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE PROVIDER. BASED ON THE US POPULATION OF ~328,000,000, THIS SUGGESTS BETWEEN 17.4 MILLION AND 19.0 MILLION AMERICANS ARE SEEKING AN ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL AT ANY GIVEN TIME.  MEANWHILE THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, IN AN APRIL 2011 NCHS DATA BRIEF, REPORTED THAT MORE THAN 50% OF THE POPULATION USES DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER. DETAILED FINDINGS FROM THAT REPORT INCLUDED.  \u00b7  USE OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS IS COMMON AMONG THE U.S. ADULT POPULATION. OVER 40% USED SUPPLEMENTS IN 1988\u20131994, AND OVER ONE-HALF IN 2003\u20132006.  \u00b7  MULTIVITAMINS/MULTIMINERALS ARE THE MOST COMMONLY USED DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS, WITH APPROXIMATELY 40% OF MEN AND WOMEN REPORTING USE DURING 2003\u20132006.  \u00b7  USE OF SUPPLEMENTAL CALCIUM INCREASED FROM 28% DURING 1988\u20131994 TO 61% DURING 2003\u20132006 AMONG WOMEN AGED 60 AND OVER.  STATUS OF OPERATIONS; CONSUMER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND SALES  MORE THAN 150 MILLION AMERICANS DRINK TEA EVERY DAY, AMOUNTING TO SOME 79 BILLION SERVINGS OF TEA IN AMERICA EVERY YEAR. OUR LAUNCH OF VIPOVATM TEA BRAND IS MEANT TO TAP INTO THIS EXISTING DEMAND. PART OF OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY IS TO BUILD NATIONAL BRANDS THROUGH PRODUCTS THAT LARGE GROUPS OF POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS ARE ALREADY FAMILIAR AND COMFORTABLE WITH.  POVIVA TEA CORP. HAS FILED MULTIPLE PATENTS PENDING AND HAS RECEIVED SEVERAL GRANTED PATENTS TO BIND ACTIVE HEMP OIL INGREDIENTS WITH A LIPID, POTENTIALLY ALLOWING FOR MORE EFFICIENT AND COMFORTING DELIVERY OF THE CBD.  LEXARIA BEGAN PRODUCING CASH FLOWS FROM ITS PRODUCTS IN JANUARY 2015; FOCUSED ON THE IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HEMP-OIL-SECTORS THAT ARE FEDERALLY LEGAL. CANNABINOIDS HAVE BEEN FOUND BY MANY RESEARCHERS TO HAVE ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES AND LEXARIA PLANS TO USE THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  PATENTED PROCESS TO INFUSE HEMP OILS INTO A NUMBER OF POPULAR FOOD AND BEVERAGES.  22  LEXARIA HAS LAUNCHED A LINE OF PREMIUM PRODUCTS, ALWAYS RELYING ON OUR DEHYDRATECH  TM  PATENTED INFUSION PROCESS, TO BRING HEMP OIL INTO THE MAINSTREAM. BECAUSE HEMP OIL DOES NOT HAVE PSYCHOACTIVE PROPERTIES WE EXPECT OUR PRODUCTS TO APPEAL TO THE WIDEST POSSIBLE CUSTOMER BASE. TO DATE WE WILL FOCUS OUR SALES EFFORTS ACROSS THE CONTINENTAL USA. SOME STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT 3% OF THE CANADIAN POPULATION REGULARLY CONSUMES HEMP FOOD PRODUCTS, WHILE 1% OF THE AMERICAN POPULATION REGULARLY CONSUMES HEMP FOOD PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THE CONSUMPTION OF HEMP BASED FOOD PRODUCTS OFFERS EXCEPTIONAL GROWTH POSSIBILITIES.  ACCORDING TO NUTRITION BUSINESS JOURNAL, THE ORGANIC FOOD SECTOR WAS A $246 BILLION INDUSTRY IN THE USA DURING 2014, WHILE DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS WAS A $34.6 BILLION INDUSTRY. ACCORDING TO ARCVIEW, LEGAL CANNABIS WAS A $4.7 BILLION US INDUSTRY IN 2015 AND EXPECTED TO GROW TO OVER A $20 BILLION SECTOR BEFORE 2025 BUT IS CLEARLY A MUCH SMALLER INDUSTRY SECTOR THAN THE MORE ESTABLISHED FOOD SECTORS. LEXARIA HAS NOT YET DETERMINED WHETHER OUR HEMP OIL-INFUSED PRODUCTS WILL BE ACCEPTED INTO ANY OR ALL THREE OF THESE PARTICULAR SECTORS.  LEXARIA HAS A MAIN CORPORATE WEBSITE AS WELL AS SMALLER E-COMMERCE FOCUSED WEBSITES DEVOTED TO CONSUMER PRODUCTS. THE MAJORITY OF PRODUCT SALES HAVE TAKEN PLACE THROUGH THE E-COMMERCE WEBSITES. A CONTRACTED NATIONAL DISTRIBUTION CENTER ENSURES RAPID AND ACCURATE FULFILLMENT OF ALL ORDERS. A 1-800 ORDERING CENTER HAS ALSO BEEN PLACED INTO OPERATION.  LEXARIA HAD PREVIOUSLY LAUNCHED THE \u201cLEXARIA ENERGY\u201d BRAND THAT IS 100% OWNED BY THE COMPANY. UNDER THIS BRAND, THE COMPANY PLANS TO DEVELOP HEMP OIL-INFUSED FOOD PRODUCTS FOR PEOPLE WITH ACTIVE LIFESTYLES, SUCH AS PROTEIN BARS, PROTEIN SHAKES AND OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS. ON NOVEMBER 3, 2015, LEXARIA ENERGY10 PROTEIN BARS BECAME AVAILABLE FOR RETAIL SALES WITH TWO FLAVORS. THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT MANUFACTURER OF THESE PROTEIN BARS WAS UNABLE TO FULFILL ADDITIONAL ORDERS AND WE HAVE NOT CURRENTLY BEEN ABLE TO LOCATE AND CONTRACT AN ALTERNATIVE LOCATION TO MANUFACTURE THIS MORE COMPLICATED FOOD PRODUCT, WITH THE RESULT THAT THE PRODUCT IS TEMPORARILY DISCONTINUED WHILE WE SEARCH FOR A SUITABLE MANUFACTURING LOCATION.  THROUGH THE NOVEMBER 2014 ACQUISITION OF 51% OF POVIVA TEA LLC, AND OCTOBER 2017 100% ACQUISITION, LEXARIA ACQUIRED CONTROL OF CERTAIN PATENTS PENDING WITH THE UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE. LEXARIA HAS WORKED TO BROADEN THE PATENTS AND EXTEND THEIR UTILITY TO MOLECULES OTHER THAN THOSE ORIGINALLY NAMED.  ON JUNE 11, 2015, LEXARIA INITIATED THE SIMULTANEOUS FILING OF A U.S. UTILITY PATENT APPLICATION AND AN INTERNATIONAL PATENT APPLICATION UNDER THE PATENT COOPERATION TREATY (PCT) PROCEDURE, BOTH AT THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (\u201cUSPTO\u201d). THESE APPLICATIONS FOLLOW THE COMPANY\u2019S 2014 AND 2015 FAMILY OF PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION FILINGS IN THE U.S. AND SERVE TWO ADDITIONAL BROAD PURPOSES.  1)  LEXARIA IS SEEKING PROTECTION OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY UNDER INTERNATIONAL TREATIES. TO THIS END LEXARIA HAS FILED FOR PCT PATENT APPLICATION PROTECTION. THERE ARE 148 COUNTRIES THAT ARE SIGNATORIES TO THE PATENT COOPERATION TREATY, INCLUDING SUCH MAJOR MARKETS AS CANADA, CHINA, INDIA, MUCH OF EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND JAPAN AMONG OTHERS.  2)  LEXARIA BELIEVES ITS LIPID INFUSION TECHNOLOGY HAS APPLICATIONS BEYOND THE DELIVERY OF JUST CANNABINOIDS. BASED ON FURTHER FORMULATION TESTING, LEXARIA HAS INCLUDED ADDITIONAL LIPOPHILIC MOLECULES THAT MAY BE DELIVERED VIA FOOD AND BEVERAGE FORMATS UTILIZING ITS TECHNOLOGY, WIDELY ENCOMPASSING THREE MAJOR NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COMPANY: NICOTINE; NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES (NSAIDS); AND VITAMINS.  IN DECEMBER 2015, THE COMPANY FILED TWO FURTHER PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATIONS IN THE U.S. THESE NEW APPLICATIONS SERVED TO FURTHER BROADEN THE VARIETY AND APPLICABILITY OF BASE COMPOUNDS THAT CAN BE USED WHEN FORMULATING THE COMPANY\u2019S LIPID BASED TECHNOLOGY. THE FIRST OF THESE APPLICATIONS IDENTIFY COMPOUNDS LIKE EDIBLE STARCHES (E.G., TAPIOCA STARCH) THAT ARE COMMONLY USED IN FOOD PRODUCTS TODAY AND COULD, THEREFORE, SERVE AS A BASE FOR FORMULATING AND INCORPORATING THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY INTO A WIDE VARIETY OF EVERY DAY FOOD PRODUCTS. THE SECOND OF THESE APPLICATIONS IDENTIFY EMULSIFIER COMPOUNDS LIKE GUM ARABIC THAT ARE COMMONLY USED IN BEVERAGE PRODUCTS TODAY IN ORDER TO FACILITATE SIMILAR FLEXIBILITY FOR FORMULATING THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY IN EVERY DAY, SHELF-STABLE BEVERAGES.  23  ON OCTOBER 26, 2016, THE USPTO ISSUED U.S PATENT NO. 9474725, CANNABINOID INFUSED FOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF, PERTAINING TO OUR METHOD OF IMPROVING BIOAVAILABILITY AND TASTE OF CERTAIN CANNABINOID LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS IN FOOD PRODUCTS. THIS IS THE COMPANY\u2019S FIRST PATENT GRANTED AND HAS A PUBLISH DATE OF OCTOBER 27, 2016 (JUNE 15 2017 IN AUSTRALIA NO. 2015274698) AND PROTECTS OUR TECHNOLOGY FOR TWENTY YEARS. ON DECEMBER 12, 2017, THE USPTO GRANTED PATENT NUMBER US 9,839,612 B2 FOR THE USE OF DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY AS A DELIVERY PLATFORM. ON MAY 22, 2018 PATENT US 9,974,739 B2, \u201cFOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS INFUSED WITH LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\u201d WAS GRANTED PROVIDING FOR \u201cCOMPOSITION OF MATTER\u201d CLAIMS THAT PROTECT THE SPECIFIC COMBINATION OF SUBSTANCES WHICH ENABLE IMPROVED TASTE AND BIOABSORPTION PROPERTIES OF ITS DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY FOR THE DELIVERY OF CANNABINOIDS. ON MAY 15, 2018 PATENT US 9,972,680 B2, \u201cFOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS INFUSED WITH LIPOPHILIC ACTIVE AGENTS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF\u201d WAS GRANTED PROVIDING CLAIMS THAT PROTECT PROCESSES FOR MAKING SPECIFIC COMPOSITIONS OF MATTER FOR ENHANCED CANNABINOID DELIVERY UTILIZING ITS DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY. ON AUGUST 31, 2018 AUSTRALIAN PATENTS 2017203054, 2018202562, AND 2018202583 WERE GRANTED. ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2018 THE USPTO GRANTED US 10,084,044 B2 AND ON OCTOBER16, 2018 US 10,103,225 B2 WITHIN THE SAME PATENT FAMILY.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT KNOW AND CANNOT KNOW WHETHER THESE STRATEGIES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL, OR IF SUCCESSFUL, HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO GAIN CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE AND CUSTOMER LOYALTY. IT CAN BE A CHALLENGE TO BE SUCCESSFUL BY INTRODUCING NEW CONSUMER PRODUCTS TO A COMPETITIVE RETAIL MARKETPLACE, AND WE CAN OFFER NO ASSURANCES THAT OUR PRODUCTS WILL BE A COMMERCIAL SUCCESS.  INTERNATIONAL PATENT PROTECTION  WHEN LEXARIA FIRST BEGAN EXAMINING THE LEGAL MEDICAL CANNABIS MARKET IN 2013, AND ENTERED THE MARKET IN 2014, THE COMPANY BELIEVED IT COULD MAKE AN IMPACT IN PERHAPS BOTH THE CANADIAN AND U.S. MARKETPLACES. OUR PURSUIT AND DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGY HAS EXPANDED OUR POTENTIAL AREA OF IMPACT, BOTH GEOGRAPHICALLY AND BY SECTOR. BECAUSE OF THE APPLICABILITY OF OUR TECHNOLOGY TO MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE LEGAL CANNABIS SECTOR, WE HAVE TAKEN THE NECESSARY STEPS TO PROTECT THAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WITHIN LARGER GLOBAL MARKETS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY LIE WITHIN THE MEDICAL CANNABIS SECTOR OR IN OTHER UNRELATED SECTORS.  ADDITIONAL MOLECULES  NICOTINE.  MORE THAN 99% OF ALL NICOTINE THAT IS CONSUMED WORLDWIDE IS DELIVERED THROUGH SMOKING CIGARETTES. APPROXIMATELY 6,000,000 DEATHS PER YEAR, WORLDWIDE, ARE ATTRIBUTED PRIMARILY TO THE DELIVERY OF NICOTINE THROUGH THE ACT OF SMOKING ACCORDING TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, WHICH ALSO ESTIMATES THAT OVER $170 BILLION PER YEAR IS SPENT JUST IN THE USA ON DIRECT MEDICAL CARE COSTS FOR ADULT SMOKERS. 69% OF U.S. ADULT SMOKERS WANT TO QUIT SMOKING AND 43% OF US ADULT SMOKERS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO QUIT IN ANY TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD.  WORLDWIDE, RETAIL CIGARETTE SALES WERE WORTH $722 BILLION IN 2013, WITH OVER 5.7 TRILLION CIGARETTES SOLD TO MORE THAN 1 BILLION SMOKERS.  RELEVANCE  : LEXARIA POSTULATES THAT DELIVERY OF NICOTINE TO SATISFY CURRENT DEMAND, UTILIZING OUR PATENTED LIPID-DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY IN COMMON FOOD GROUPS, COULD SHIFT DEMAND FROM SMOKING CIGARETTES TO ALTERNATIVE NICOTINE-BASED FOOD PRODUCTS. SINCE MOST OF THE ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF NICOTINE CONSUMPTION ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELIVERY METHOD AND ONLY TO A LESSER DEGREE TO THE ACTUAL INGESTION OF NICOTINE, THERE COULD BE A VAST POSITIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH OUTCOME THROUGH THE REDUCTION IN SMOKING CIGARETTES. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND REGULATORY COMPLIANT INVESTIGATIONS WOULD NEED TO BE CONDUCTED BEFORE OTHERWISE HEALTHY FOODS SUCH AS TEA, COFFEE OR ENERGY BAR SNACKS CONTAINING NICOTINE COULD BE INTRODUCED. NICOTINE IS A NAMED MOLECULE IN THE LATEST LEXARIA PATENT APPLICATIONS.  NSAID  . NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES ARE THE SECOND-LARGEST CATEGORY OF PAIN MANAGEMENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN THE WORLD. THE GLOBAL PAIN MANAGEMENT MARKET WAS ESTIMATED AT $22 BILLION IN 2011, WITH $5.4 BILLION OF THIS MARKET BEING SERVED BY NSAID\u2019S. THE U.S. MAKES UP OVER ONE-HALF OF THE GLOBAL MARKET. THE OPIOIDS MARKET (SUCH AS MORPHINE) FORM THE LARGEST SINGLE PAIN MANAGEMENT SECTOR BUT ARE KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SERIOUS DEPENDENCE AND TOLERANCE ISSUES.  24  SOME OF THE MOST COMMONLY KNOWN NSAIDS ARE ASA (ASPIRIN), IBUPROFEN (ADVIL, MOTRIN), AND ACETAMINOPHEN (TYLENOL). (ACETAMINOPHEN IS NOT ACCEPTED BY ALL PERSONS TO BE AN NSAID.) ALTHOUGH NSAIDS ARE GENERALLY A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT METHOD FOR PAIN, THEY HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH A NUMBER OF GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS INCLUDING DYSPEPSIA AND GASTRIC BLEEDING.  RELEVANCE  : LEXARIA POSTULATES THAT DELIVERY OF NSAIDS THROUGH A LIPID-BASED MECHANISM COULD PROVIDE THE BENEFICIAL PROPERTIES OF PAIN RELIEF WITH LESSENED NEGATIVE GASTROINTESTINAL EFFECTS, AND ALSO POTENTIALLY DELIVER LOWER DOSAGES OF ACTIVE INGREDIENTS WITH SIMILAR PAIN MANAGEMENT OUTCOMES AS CURRENT PILL FORMS AT HIGHER DOSAGES. ASA, PIROXICAM, DICLOFENAC, INDOMETHACIN, IBUPROFEN, AND ACETAMINOPHEN ARE ALL NAMED MOLECULES IN THE LATEST LEXARIA PATENT APPLICATIONS.  VITAMINS.  THE GLOBAL VITAMIN AND SUPPLEMENT MARKET IS WORTH $68 BILLION ACCORDING TO EUROMONITOR. THE CATEGORY IS BOTH BROAD AND DEEP, COMPRISED OF MANY POPULAR AND SOME LESSER KNOWN SUBSTANCES. VITAMINS IN GENERAL ARE THOUGHT TO BE AN $8.5 BILLION ANNUAL MARKET IN THE U.S. THE U.S. IS THE LARGEST SINGLE NATIONAL MARKET IN THE WORLD, AND CHINA AND JAPAN ARE THE 2  ND  AND 3  RD  LARGEST VITAMIN MARKETS.  VITAMIN E IS FAT SOLUBLE AND CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO CELL MEMBRANES WHICH CAN PROTECT THEM FROM OXIDATIVE DAMAGE. GLOBAL CONSUMPTION OF NATURAL SOURCE VITAMIN E WAS 10,900 METRIC TONS IN 2013 WORTH $611.9 MILLION.  RELEVANCE  : LEXARIA POSTULATES THAT DELIVERY OF FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS THROUGH ITS PATENTED LIPID-BASED DELIVERY MECHANISM MAY RESULT IN LESS WASTE AND LOWER DOSAGES REQUIRED THAN MOST CURRENT PILL FORMS. AS WELL, INGESTION OF PILLS IS AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE FOR MANY PEOPLE SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT VITAMIN DELIVERY THROUGH COMMON FOOD GROUPS COULD VASTLY EXPAND MARKET DEMAND FOR THIS SECTOR. VITAMIN E IS A NAMED MOLECULE IN THE LATEST LEXARIA PATENT APPLICATIONS.  ON AUGUST 11, 2015, LEXARIA SIGNED A LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH POVIVA TEA LLC FOR $10,000, GRANTING LEXARIA A 35-YEAR NON EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE LICENSE TO UNENCUMBERED USE OF POVIVA TEA LLC\u2019S IP RIGHTS, INCLUDING RIGHTS OF RESALE. THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ENSURES LEXARIA HAS FULL ACCESS TO THE UNDERLYING INFUSION TECHNOLOGY.  SCIENTIFIC TESTING AND VALIDATION  ON AUGUST 24, 2015, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED POTENTIAL INDUSTRY-CHANGING ACHIEVEMENTS IN ENHANCED GASTRO-INTESTINAL ABSORPTION OF CANNABIDIOL (CBD) UTILIZING LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY. THE THIRD-PARTY TESTING WAS CONDUCTED IN TWO PHASES OF  IN VITRO  TESTS BEGINNING IN JUNE AND COMPLETED IN AUGUST, 2015.  THE INDEPENDENT LABORATORY RESULTS DELIVERED AVERAGE CBD PERMEABILITY OF 499% OF BASELINE PERMEABILITY, COMPARED TO CBD PERMEABILITY WITHOUT LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY. THESE RESULTS EXCEED COMPANY EXPECTATIONS. THIS WAS ASSESSED IN A STRICTLY CONTROLLED,  IN VITRO  EXPERIMENT USING A HUMAN INTESTINAL TISSUE MODEL. SAMPLES OF LEXARIA\u2019S COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CBD-FORTIFIED VIPOVATM BLACK TEA WERE ADMINISTERED IN THE MODEL COMPARED WITH CONCENTRATION-MATCHED CBD CONTROL PREPARATIONS THAT LACKED LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED FORMULATION AND PROCESS ENHANCEMENTS. LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT ITS  IN VITRO  FINDINGS PROVIDE COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF THE INTESTINAL ABSORPTION ENHANCING CAPABILITIES OF ITS TECHNOLOGY, BASED ON WHICH IT IS EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES TO PROGRESS TO MORE ADVANCED, FOLLOW-ON BIOAVAILABILITY TESTING IN ANIMALS.  THE TESTS ALSO SHOWED 325% OF BASELINE GASTRO-INTESTINAL PERMEABILITY OF CBD COMPARING LEXARIA\u2019S CBD-FORTIFIED VIPOVATM BLACK TEA TO A SECOND CONTROL OF CBD AND BLACK TEA COMBINED,  WITHOUT  LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED FORMULATION ENHANCEMENTS. THIS CONFIRMED THAT THE SPECIALIZED PROCESSING UNDERTAKEN BY LEXARIA DURING ITS MANUFACTURING PROCESS TOGETHER WITH ITS FORMULATION ENHANCEMENTS, DOES INDEED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE ABSORPTION LEVELS.  THE BIOAVAILABILITY OF CBD (OR OF THC) VARIES GREATLY BY DELIVERY METHOD. SMOKING TYPICALLY DELIVERS CANNABINOIDS AT AN AVERAGE BIOAVAILABILITY RATE OF 30% (HUESTIS (2007) CHEM. BIODIVERS. 4:1770\u20131804; MCGILVERAY (2005) PAIN RES. MANAG. 10 SUPPL. A:15A \u2013 22A). BY COMPARISON, ORALLY CONSUMED CANNABIS EDIBLES TYPICALLY DELIVER CANNABINOIDS AT AN AVERAGE BIOAVAILABILITY RATE OF ONLY 5% (KARSCHNER ET AL. (2011) CLIN. CHEM. 57:66\u201375).  25  THE COMPANY\u2019S PRESENT FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ITS TECHNOLOGY MAY ACHIEVE A 5-FOLD IMPROVEMENT IN CANNABINOID ABSORPTION IN EDIBLE FORM OVER THAT WHICH CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT ITS PROPRIETARY PROCESS AND FORMULATION ENHANCEMENTS. THIS CONCEPTUALLY SUPPORTS THAT LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGH IN CANNABINOID DELIVERY BY APPROXIMATING THE HIGH ABSORPTION LEVELS ACHIEVED AS THOUGH THROUGH ADMINISTRATION BY SMOKING, BUT WITHOUT THE ASSOCIATED NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON HUMAN HEALTH CAUSED BY SMOKING.  THE TESTS WERE COMPLETED IN TWO PHASES CULMINATING WITH TESTING USING SIMULATED INTESTINAL FLUID CONDITIONS THAT DELIVERED THESE FINDINGS. THESE RESULTS WERE STRONGER THAN EARLIER ITERATIONS OF THE TESTS THAT DID NOT USE A SIMULATED INTESTINAL FLUID ENVIRONMENT AND CONTRIBUTED TO LEXARIA\u2019S UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS AT WORK. FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS, LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT BIOAVAILABILITY TESTING IN ANIMALS IS LIKELY TO YIELD EVEN STRONGER ABSORPTION RESULTS IN THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL INTESTINAL FLUID CONDITIONS.  CBD HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY FOUND TO PROVIDE BENEFICIAL PAIN RELIEVING, ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, ANTI-ANXIETY, NEUROPROTECTION, ANTI-PSYCHOTIC, AND ANTI-CONVULSIVE EFFECTS AMONG OTHERS. LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED TECHNOLOGY COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE INDIVIDUAL SERVING REQUIREMENTS FOR CBD TO CONSUMERS. THIS COULD LEAD TO REDUCED COSTS OF CONSUMPTION FOR CONSUMERS AND INCREASED PROFITABILITY FOR LEXARIA.  LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT THE SAME TECHNOLOGY USED TO ENHANCE THE ABSORPTION OF CBD IN THE RECENT LABORATORY TESTS, IS APPLICABLE TO THC, NICOTINE, NSAIDS AND OTHER LIPOPHILIC COMPOUNDS THAT ARE WIDELY USED TODAY.  DURING JANUARY 2015, LEXARIA CONDUCTED A STUDY OF NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS IN HUMANS, AS A BIOMARKER FOR ABSORPTION OF CANNABIDIOL, WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE OF THE EFFICIENT ABSORPTION OF CANNABIDIOL FROM LEXARIA FOOD PRODUCTS ENHANCED WITH HEMP OIL, BY DEMONSTRATING THE ELEVATION OF NITRIC OXIDE IN THE HUMAN BODY IN RESPONSE TO PRODUCT INGESTION.  THE STUDY DATA FROM HUMAN SUBJECTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT ELEVATION OF SYSTEMIC NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS AS A SURROGATE BIOMARKER FOR CANNABIDIOL (CBD) BIOABSORPTION IN RESPONSE TO INGESTION OF LEXARIA\u2019S PRODUCTS. THIS PROVIDED CLINICAL SUPPORT FOR THE CBD BIOAVAILABILITY ENHANCING PROPERTIES OF LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED TECHNOLOGY, ON THE PREMISE THAT BIOAVAILABLE CBD IS KNOWN TO ELEVATE LEVELS OF THE ENDOCANNABINOID ANANDAMIDE IN THE HUMAN BODY WHICH, IN TURN, STIMULATES RELEASE OF NITRIC OXIDE IN THE VASCULAR SYSTEM.  IN SUMMARY, CONSUMING LEXARIA AND VIPOVATM FOOD PRODUCTS RESULTED IN ELEVATED LEVELS OF NITRIC OXIDE WITHIN THE BODY. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY INDICATED THAT ALL LEXARIA AND VIPOVATM FOOD PRODUCTS ELICITED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SALIVARY NITRIC OXIDE, ACHIEVING LEVELS FROM 110 \u039cM TO AS HIGH AS 220 \u039cM IN THE TEST SUBJECTS. THE BEVERAGE PRODUCTS GENERALLY HAD FASTER INITIAL RESPONSES IN AS LITTLE AS 15 MINUTES AFTER PRODUCT INGESTION, WHEREAS THE INITIAL RESPONSES FROM THE PROTEIN-ENERGY BARS REQUIRED 30 MINUTES. THE FASTER RESPONSE TIME WITH THE BEVERAGE PRODUCTS WAS TO BE EXPECTED, GIVEN THE RELATIVE EASE OF DIGESTING LIQUIDS VERSUS SOLIDS. ALL PRODUCTS SUSTAINED THEIR MAXIMUM LEVELS OF NITRIC OXIDE DETECTION THROUGH TO THE 60-MINUTE END-POINTS USED IN THE STUDY, INDICATING A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL STUDY TO DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS REMAIN ELEVATED FOLLOWING PRODUCTION CONSUMPTION.  THE STUDY ASSESSED SIX FLAVORS OF VIPOVATM TEA (YUNAN BLACK, HERBAL CHERRY BLACK, EARL GREY, HERBAL BENGAL CHAI, HERBAL MASALA CHAI AND DECAF ENGLISH BREAKFAST), VIPOVATM COLUMBIAN SUPREMO COFFEE, VIPOVATM HOT CHOCOLATE AND LEXARIA ENERGY FOODS\u2019 CHOCOLATE BERRY DATE AND CASHEW BERRY DATE PROTEIN-ENERGY BARS.  SIX HEALTHY HUMAN SUBJECTS (3 MALE AND 3 FEMALE) BETWEEN THE AGES OF 22 AND 65 YEARS OF AGE WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY. SUBJECTS WERE SCREENED FOR CARDIOVASCULAR AND ALLERGIC RESPONSE TO HEMP PRODUCTS, WERE NON-SMOKERS AND DID NOT HAVE ANY HISTORY OF SUBSTANCE OR ALCOHOL ABUSE. ONE PRODUCT WAS STUDIED PER DAY ACROSS ALL SIX SUBJECTS, WITH EACH SUBJECT CONSUMING A FULL PRODUCT SERVING SIZE. SUBJECTS WERE REQUIRED TO REFRAIN FROM EATING FOOD OR USING VAPE PRODUCTS FOR AT LEAST 12 HOURS BEFORE TEST ARTICLE ADMINISTRATION ON EACH DAY OF THE STUDY. NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS IN THE TEST SUBJECTS WERE ASSESSED USING A COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE, COLORIMETRIC TEST KIT DESIGNED TO QUANTIFY SYSTEMIC NITRIC OXIDE VIA A DETECTABLE SALIVARY MARKER. IMMEDIATELY BEFORE TEST ARTICLE ADMINISTRATION EACH DAY, ALL SUBJECTS WERE REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE A NEGATIVE BASELINE NITRIC OXIDE SALIVA TEST. SUBJECTS WERE CONSIDERED TO HAVE A NEGATIVE TEST STRIP READING AT A LEVEL OF 20 \u039cM ACCORDING TO THE TEST STRIP SCALE, AND POSITIVE READINGS ANYWHERE ABOVE THIS. SUBJECTS PERFORMED SALIVARY NITRIC OXIDE TESTING AT 15, 30, 45 AND 60 MINUTES\u2019 POST-CONSUMPTION OF EACH PRODUCT. ALL SUBJECTS REMAINED SEDENTARY FROM BASELINE THROUGH TO THE COMPLETION OF TESTING FOR EACH PRODUCT.  26  IN AUGUST OF 2018 WE RELEASED RESULTS FROM OUR TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES IN A RANDOMIZED, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, DOUBLE-BLIND EUROPEAN HUMAN CLINICAL STUDY THAT EVALUATED TURBOCBD  TM  - A PROPRIETARY, DEHYDRATECHTM POWERED, CANNABIDIOL (\u201cCBD\u201d) FORTIFIED HEMP OIL CAPSULE DEVELOPED BY LEXARIA. THE DEGREE AND SPEED OF CBD ABSORPTION INTO BLOOD PLASMA AND POTENTIAL CARDIOVASCULAR AND COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT IN 12 HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS WERE STUDIED.  KEY BIOAVAILABILITY DATA HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE STUDY COMPARING THE 90 MG DOSE OF LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBDTM TO A 90 MG DOSE OF A POSITIVE CONTROL FORMULATION WITHOUT LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY WERE AS FOLLOWS.  \u00b7  30 MINUTES: CBD DELIVERED FROM LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES WAS ABSORBED MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN FROM THE POSITIVE CONTROL, DELIVERING 317% MORE CBD TO BLOOD AT THE 30-MINUTE MARK OF THE STUDY (I.E., 18.4 NG/ML COMPARED TO ONLY 4.4 NG/ML ON AVERAGE RESPECTIVELY [95% CI; P=0.051]);  \u00b7  60 MINUTES: THE TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES WENT ON TO DELIVER MORE CBD TO THE BLOOD AT THE 60-MINUTE MARK (I.E., 38.8 NG/ML) THAN THE POSITIVE CONTROL CAPSULES WERE ABLE TO REACH AT ANY TIME DURING THE 6-HOUR STUDY, FURTHER DEMONSTRATING THE EXCEPTIONAL RAPIDITY OF ACTION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TURBOCBDTM CAPSULES;  \u00b7  90 MINUTES: THE TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES FURTHER WENT ON TO DELIVER SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CBD TO THE BLOOD (86% MORE) THAN THE POSITIVE CONTROL CAPSULES AT THE 90-MINUTE MARK (I.E., 53.0 NG/ML COMPARED TO ONLY 28.4 NG/ML RESPECTIVELY [95% CI; P=0.034]);  \u00b7  THROUGH TO STUDY COMPLETION: LEXARIA\u2019S TURBOCBD  TM  CAPSULES CONTINUED TO DELIVER MORE CBD TO BLOOD THAN THE POSITIVE CONTROL CAPSULES AT EACH SUBSEQUENT TIME POINT IN THE STUDY THROUGH TO THE 6-HOUR MARK WHEN THE STUDY WAS COMPLETED.  THESE RESULTS CORROBORATE AND CONFIRM OTHER IN VITRO AND IN VIVO STUDIES THAT HAVE EVALUATED LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY. ALTHOUGH THIS STUDY EVALUATED ABSORPTION ONLY OF CBD AND ITS METABOLITES, LEXARIA BELIEVES NEARLY IDENTICAL BIOAVAILABILITY ENHANCEMENT RESULTS WOULD BE ACHIEVED WITH OTHER CANNABINOIDS.  WE HAVE ALSO COMPLETED OUR FIRST STUDY EVALUATING DEHYDRATECH  TM  USED IN A TOPICAL CREAM FORMULATION FOR ABSORPTION OF CBD THROUGH HUMAN SKIN. RESULTS PROVED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN BOTH SPEED AND QUANTITY OF CBD ABSORPTION THROUGH SKIN WHEN COMPARED TO CONTROL FORMULATIONS. THE ABSORPTION STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON HUMAN SKIN AT A CALIFORNIA-BASED LABORATORY THAT SPECIALIZES IN FRANZ DIFFUSION CELL SKIN PERMEABILITY TESTING. LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY WAS USED TOGETHER WITH A SOPHISTICATED OIL-IN-WATER EMULSION FORMULATION DESIGN AND COMPARED TO A SERIES OF MATCHING OIL-IN-WATER EMULSION FORMULATIONS PREPARED WITH THE SAME CBD INPUTS, WITH AND WITHOUT THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY AND WITH AND WITHOUT TWO LEADING SKIN PENETRATION ENHANCERS CURRENTLY USED IN THE SKIN PRODUCTS INDUSTRY. SEVERAL FACTORS WERE MEASURED, INCLUDING THE TIME REQUIRED TO DETECT CBD SKIN PENETRATION AND QUANTITY, AND PEAK AMOUNTS OF CBD ABSORBED INTO AND THROUGH THE SKIN, AT MULTIPLE TESTING INTERVALS OVER A 48-HOUR DURATION.  LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  -ENABLED TOPICAL FORMULATION, ABSENT EITHER OF THE COMMERCIAL PENETRATION ENHANCERS, WAS THE FASTEST ACTING FOR ABSORPTION INTO THE EPIDERMIS, DERMIS OR THROUGH THE SKIN INTO THE SYSTEMIC FRACTION REPRESENTING PERMEATION INTO THE UNDERLYING CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  -ENABLED PRODUCT ALSO HAD NO ODOUR EVEN WITHOUT THE USE OF PERFUMES, CONTRARY TO OTHER CANNABINOID INDUSTRY PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE QUITE STRONGLY ODORIFEROUS WITHOUT THE USE OF MASKING PERFUMES.  FURTHERMORE, LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  -ENABLED TOPICAL FORMULATION WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF EITHER OF THE COMMERCIAL PENETRATION ENHANCERS, DEMONSTRATED THE HIGHEST OVERALL AVERAGE QUANTITY OF CBD DELIVERED THROUGH THE SKIN AND INTO THE REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEMIC FRACTION OF ALL THE FORMULATIONS TESTED, WITH AS MUCH AS A 225% INCREASE IN CBD PERMEABILITY WHEN COMPARED TO THE HIGHEST PERFORMING COMMERCIAL PENETRATION ENHANCER FORMULATION ASSESSED AND ALMOST A 1,900% INCREASE IN CBD PERMEABILITY WHEN COMPARED TO A CONTROL FORMULATION THAT WAS DEVOID OF BOTH THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY OR ANY COMMERCIAL PENETRATION ENHANCERS. THE COMMERCIAL SKIN PENETRATION ENHANCERS ONLY DEMONSTRATED PERFORMANCE THAT WAS ON PAR OR SUPERIOR TO THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  -ENABLED FORMULATIONS TESTED IN SO FAR AS TOTAL CBD ABSORPTION INTO THE SHALLOW EPIDERMIS OR DERMIS WAS CONCERNED.  27  WE HAVE ALSO COMPLETED OUR FIRST INGESTIBLE NICOTINE IN VIVO (ANIMAL) ABSORPTION STUDY. LEXARIA IS PURSUING THE USE OF ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY AS A POSSIBLE NEW NICOTINE DELIVERY METHOD, AN EDIBLE DOSE ABSORBED THROUGH THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT, WITH POTENTIAL BOTH AS A NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY AS WELL AS AN ALTERNATIVE PRODUCT FORMAT FOR REGULAR TOBACCO USERS.  DEHYDRATECH  TM  DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING MAJOR NICOTINE ABSORPTION PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS: 1,160% FASTER DELIVERY OF EQUIVALENT PEAK QUANTITIES OF NICOTINE TO THE BLOODSTREAM THAN ACHIEVED WITH CONTROLS (WITHIN 15 MIN VS. 2.9 HOURS), 148% GAIN IN THE QUANTITY OF PEAK NICOTINE DELIVERY TO THE BLOODSTREAM RELATIVE TO CONTROLS, 560% HIGHER BRAIN LEVELS OF NICOTINE WHERE NICOTINE EFFECTS ARE FOCUSED, COMPARED TO CONTROLS, LOWER URINE LEVELS OF NICOTINE EXCRETED THAN CONTROLS, FOR ENHANCED NICOTINE ACTIVITY AND BIOAVAILABILITY OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY, LOWER QUANTITIES OF KEY LIVER METABOLITES IN THE BLOODSTREAM THAN CONTROLS AS HYPOTHESIZED, SUGGESTING BYPASS OF FIRST PASS LIVER METABOLISM.  STUDY DESIGN PARAMETERS.  THE STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO PRINCIPALLY ASSESS THE RELATIVE INGESTIBLE NICOTINE ABSORPTION PERFORMANCE OF DEHYDRATECH  TM  -POWERED FORMULATIONS COMPARED TO CONCENTRATION-MATCHED CONTROL FORMULATIONS THAT LACKED ANY FORM OF DELIVERY ENABLING TECHNOLOGY IN RATS. NICOTINE WAS ADMINISTERED IN A NICOTINE POLACRILEX DERIVATIVE FORMAT AS IS WIDELY COMMERCIALIZED TODAY IN NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY PRODUCTS SUCH AS CHEWING GUMS. TWELVE MALE RATS WERE DIVIDED INTO FOUR GROUPS OF THREE, SUCH THAT DEHYDRATECH  TM  AND CONTROL FORMULATIONS WERE EACH TESTED AT A 1 MG/KG AND 10 MG/KG DOSAGE LEVEL. FORMULATIONS WERE ADMINISTERED ORALLY AND ALL RATS WERE CANNULATED FOR BLOOD COLLECTION AT MULTIPLE INTERVALS OVER AN 8 HOUR DURATION POST-DOSING WITH THE FIRST DATA COLLECTION AT THE 15-MINUTE MARK. URINE AND FECES WERE ALSO COLLECTED FOR UP TO A 24-HOUR DURATION POST-DOSING, AND ESSENTIAL ORGAN TISSUE SAMPLES WERE ALSO COLLECTED FOR EXAMINATION AFTER THE STUDY. ALL SAMPLES WERE SUBJECTED TO ANALYTICAL TESTING IN ORDER TO QUANTIFY THE LEVELS OF NICOTINE THEREIN, AS WELL AS THE LEVELS OF THREE MAJOR LIVER METABOLITES THEREOF, HYDROXYCOTININE, NICOTINE N\u2019-OXIDE AND COTININE, IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE RELATIVE METABOLITE LEVELS ABSORBED BY THE DIFFERENT FORMULATIONS. LEXARIA\u2019S HYPOTHESIS WAS TESTED TO PROVE THAT ITS DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY WOULD INFLUENCE MORE RAPID AND COMPLETE INTESTINAL BIOABSORPTION OF NICOTINE LYMPHATICALLY WITH LESS METABOLIC DEGRADATION BY THE LIVER. ALL ANIMALS WERE ALSO ASSESSED FOR GENERAL TOLERABILITY OF THE ADMINISTERED FORMULATIONS. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT THE SAME INDEPENDENT LABORATORY IN PHILADELPHIA WHERE THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS INITIAL CANNABIDIOL ABSORPTION STUDY IN 2015.  RESULTS & OBSERVATIONS.  THE LEXARIA FORMULATIONS GENERALLY ACHIEVED FASTER ABSORPTION, HIGHER PEAK ABSORPTION AND HIGHER OVERALL QUANTITIES OF NICOTINE, ON AVERAGE, IN THE BLOOD THAN THE CONCENTRATION-MATCHED CONTROL FORMULATIONS AT BOTH THE 1MG AND 10 MG/KG DOSES TESTED. FURTHERMORE, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THERE WERE NO OBVIOUS SIGNS OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISTRESS SUCH AS VOMITING OR DIARRHEA INDICATING THAT THE ANIMALS APPEARED TO TOLERATE THE TREATMENT WELL.  NICOTINE BLOOD LEVELS WERE EVALUATED MULTIPLE TIMES OVER A PERIOD OF 8 HOURS AFTER DOSING. IN THE 10MG/KG DOSING ARM, THE CONTROL FORMULATION REQUIRED NEARLY 3 HOURS TO REACH SIMILAR LEVELS OF BLOOD ABSORPTION THAT THE LEXARIA FORMULATION REACHED IN ONLY 15 MINUTES. FURTHERMORE, THE LEXARIA FORMULATION WENT ON THEREAFTER TO DEMONSTRATE PEAK PLASMA LEVELS THAT WERE 148% OF THOSE ACHIEVED BY THE CONTROL FORMULATION. IF REPLICATED IN HUMAN STUDIES, THESE FINDINGS ARE SUGGESTIVE THAT LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY COULD PROVE MORE EFFECTIVE IN ELEVATING BLOOD NICOTINE LEVELS THROUGH EDIBLE FORMATS MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND SUBSTANTIALLY THAN PREVIOUSLY THEORIZED, POTENTIALLY MAKING INGESTIBLE NICOTINE PREPARATIONS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO TODAY\u2019S AVAILABLE PRODUCT FORMATS WHILE ALSO LEADING TO A MORE RAPID NICOTINE CRAVING SATIATION.  ANALYSIS OF THE LIVER METABOLITES REVEALED, AS EXPECTED, THAT OVERALL LEVELS IN THE BLOOD OF TWO OF THE THREE METABOLITES STUDIED WERE HIGHER IN THE CONTROL GROUP THAN IN THE LEXARIA FORMULATION GROUP AT THE 10 MG/KG DOSE. THIS RESULT WAS ESPECIALLY PRONOUNCED IN THE 45-MINUTE TO 2-HOUR TIME INTERVAL POST-DOSING WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPECTED TIMING OF RELEASE OF METABOLITES IN HIGHER QUANTITY INTO THE BLOODSTREAM BY THE LIVER FOLLOWING NORMAL PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSING OF INGESTED NICOTINE WITH THE CONTROL PREPARATION, COMPARED TO THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY THAT IS BELIEVED TO ELUDE FIRST PASS LIVER METABOLISM. THE LEXARIA FORMULATION ALSO DEMONSTRATED LOWER QUANTITIES OF NICOTINE IN THE RAT URINE AT BOTH DOSES, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FACT THAT THE LEVELS OF NICOTINE IN THE RAT BLOOD REMAINED HIGHER OVER THE DURATION OF THE STUDY WITH THE LEXARIA FORMULATION THAN WITH THE CONTROL. THE STUDY ALSO REVEALED THAT THE LEXARIA FORMULATION AT THE 10 MG/KG LEVEL ACHIEVED UP TO 5.6-TIMES AS MUCH NICOTINE UPON ANALYSIS OF THE RAT BRAIN TISSUE THAN WAS RECOVERED WITH THE MATCHING CONTROL FORMULATION. THESE FINDINGS TOGETHER PERHAPS SUGGEST PROLONGATION OF NICOTINE EFFECTIVENESS WITH THE LEXARIA FORMULATION WHICH MAY ALSO BE BENEFICIAL IN HUMANS TO CONTROL CRAVINGS OVER AN EXTENDED TIME-PERIOD FROM A SINGLE EDIBLE NICOTINE DOSE.  28  IN OUR FOLLOW-UP THIRD-PARTY  IN VIVO  STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT STUDY, INCLUDING TWO GROUPS OF 20 ANIMALS, FURTHER DEFINING DELIVERY OF NICOTINE IN EDIBLE FORM AT EACH OF THE 2, 4, 6, 8 AND 10-MINUTE INTERVALS POST-DOSING, WITH 90.2% GREATER DELIVERY THAN THE CONCENTRATION-MATCHED CONTROL FORMULATION BY THE 10-MINUTE MARK (95% CI; P=0.044), AND SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER ABSORPTION LEVELS THAN THE CONTROL FORMULATION AT ALL SUBSEQUENT TIME POINTS IN THE STUDY. SPEED OF ONSET IS A KEY ATTRIBUTE FOR ORAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND IT IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF NON-INHALATION NICOTINE DELIVERY FORMATS.  KEY HIGHLIGHTS OF THE FOLLOW-UP STUDY ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u00b7  PEAK LEVEL: 79% IMPROVEMENT IN PEAK BLOOD LEVELS (MAXIMUM CONCENTRATION OR \u201cCMAX\u201d) AT 394 NG/ML USING LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY VS. 220 NG/ML WITH THE CONTROL (95% CI; P=0.0257);  \u00b7  TOTAL QUANTITY: 94% IMPROVEMENT IN TOTAL QUANTITY OF NICOTINE DELIVERED (AREA UNDER THE CURVE OR \u201cAUC\u201d) TO THE BLOOD DURING THE 60-MINUTE COURSE OF THE STUDY, AT 266 HR\u2022NG/ML VERSUS 137 HR\u2022NG/ML (95% CI; P=0.0086);  \u00b7  RAPIDITY: LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY DELIVERED NICOTINE INTO THE BLOOD STREAM BY THE FIRST TIME INTERVAL OF BLOOD SAMPLING AT THE 2-MINUTE MARK. ON AVERAGE, LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY DELIVERED 203 NG/ML TO THE BLOOD IN AGGREGATE OF THE 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 AND 15-MINUTE TIME POINTS, COMPARED TO ONLY 120 NG/ML IN AGGREGATE OVER THE SAME PERIOD BY THE CONTROL, AN IMPROVEMENT OF 70% (95% CI; P=0.0004).  IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE DESCRIBED SCIENTIFIC TESTING AND VALIDATION STUDIES, LEXARIA HAS ALSO CONDUCTED VARIOUS CANNABINOID FORMULATION EXPERIMENTS, TOGETHER WITH POTENTIAL DEHYDRATECH  TM  LICENSEE PARTNERS, ON CHOCOLATES, CANDIES, GUMMIES, MOUTH-MELTS, CHOCOLATE BARS, PROTEIN BARS, BEVERAGES SUCH AS BEER, SPICES, TEA, COFFEE, SUPPLEMENTS AND MORE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. BEVERAGE FORMULATIONS HAVE PRODUCED CANNABINOID WATER-BASED PRODUCTS INCLUDING DE-ALCOHOLIZED BEER THAT MASK UNWANTED CANNABIS FLAVOR AND ARE FAST ACTING. CHOCOLATE FORMULATIONS WERE REPORTED AS BEING THE FASTEST ACTING, MOST CONSISTENT, AND BEST-TASTING PRODUCTS RELATIVE TO COMPARATOR CONTROL FORMULATIONS IN APPROXIMATELY 70% OF CASES IN A RECENT 2017 CONSUMER STUDY. AS WELL, ON MARCH 22, 2016, LEXARIA ANNOUNCED RESULTS FROM ANOTHER CHOCOLATE FORMULATION CONSUMER STUDY IN WHICH TEST SUBJECTS RANKED THOSE CHOCOLATES THAT HAD BEEN CREATED WITH LEXARIA\u2019S TECHNOLOGY AS THE BEST TASTING, MOST PALATABLE AND PROVIDING THE BEST OVERALL EXPERIENCE OF THE CHOCOLATES SAMPLED. FURTHERMORE, THE TEST SUBJECTS IN THAT STUDY INDICATED A TIME OF ONSET OF THE CANNABIS OIL EFFECTS IN AS LITTLE AS 15-20 MINUTES ON AVERAGE. THE STUDY INCLUDED 12 VOLUNTEERS WHO WERE ALL REGULAR CANNABIS CONSUMERS WITH EXPERIENCE INGESTING CONVENTIONAL EDIBLES. ALL CHOCOLATES USED IN THE STUDY WERE BLINDED (UNMARKED) IN ORDER THAT THE SUBJECTS COULD NOT DISCERN THE PRODUCT FORMULATIONS APPLIED.  TECHNOLOGY OUT-LICENSING  ON MAY 14, 2016, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH NUKA ENTERPRISES, LLC FOR A TWO-YEAR PERIOD, TO UTILIZE THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE, TEST, MANUFACTURE, AND SELL MARIJUANA-INFUSED CONSUMABLE AND/OR TOPICAL PRODUCTS, IN THE STATE OF COLORADO, WITH AN OPTION OF EXTENDING THE TERMS OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT TO WASHINGTON, OREGON, AND CALIFORNIA. ON APRIL 30, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A NEW 10-YEAR RENEWAL LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH NUKA ENTERPRISES LLC, MAKER OF 1906 BRAND CANNABIS CHOCOLATES AND OTHER EDIBLE PRODUCTS. THE NEW AGREEMENT PROVIDES NUKA ENTERPRISES LLC WITH SEMI-EXCLUSIVE ABILITY TO UTILIZE THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY ACROSS THE US. NUKA ALSO ACQUIRED AN OPTION TO EXPAND ITS PRODUCTS AND BRAND TO CANADA, INCLUDING USING LEXARIA\u2019S EXISTING CHOCOLATE AND CONFECTIONS CONTRACT MANUFACTURER LICENSEE CANNFECTIONS GROUP INC. THE AGREEMENT INCORPORATES NEW RIGHTS IN PRODUCT CATEGORIES IN ADDITION TO THE ORIGINAL CHOCOLATE FORMATS, WHICH INCLUDE CANDIES, BEVERAGES, CAPSULES AND PILLS, AND TOPICAL CREAMS.  ON JANUARY 25, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH A 7-YEAR TERM WITH CANNFECTIONS GROUP INC. WHEREBY LEXARIA IS PROVIDING ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY TO EMPOWER NEXT-GENERATION PERFORMANCE IN CANNABIS INFUSED CHOCOLATES AND CANDIES TO BE DEVELOPED AND SOLD IN CANADA AND INTERNATIONALLY.  29  ON FEBRUARY 26, 2018 THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT ENTERED AN AGREEMENT WITH NEUTRISCI INTERNATIONAL INC. (\u201cNEUTRISCI\u201d) (TSX-V: NU, OTCQB: NRXCF) SUCH THAT NEUTRISCI NOW OWNS 100% OF AMBARII TRADE CORPORATION AND LEXARIA HAS GRANTED TO NEUTRISCI AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSE AND SUPPLY AGREEMENT FOR THE MANUFACTURING AND SALE OF CBD BASED PRODUCTS.  ON FEBRUARY 27, 2018 THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH LOS ANGELES-BASED, PRIVATELY-HELD BIOLOG, INC. (\u201cBIOLOG\u201d) FOR A 5-YEAR TERM WHEREBY LEXARIA PROVIDED ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY TO EMPOWER A UNIQUE SET OF NEXT-GENERATION FOOD AND BEVERAGE CANNABIS INFUSION PRODUCTS TO BE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES.  ON APRIL 25, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT ENTERED A DEFINITIVE TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH GP HOLDINGS LLC, (\u201cGP\u201d) WHEREBY LEXARIA PROVIDED ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY FOR CANNABIS INFUSED BEVERAGES AND TOPICAL SKIN PRODUCTS IN CALIFORNIA. GP ACQUIRED A 5-YEAR SEMI-EXCLUSIVE RIGHT. SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR END, ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2018, THE COMPANY CANCELLED THE CONTRACT DUE TO ONGOING DELAYS AND NON-PERFORMANCE.  ON JULY 31, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED, AND HILL STREET BEVERAGE COMPANY INC., (TSXV:BEER; \u201cHILL STREET\u201d) JOINTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO LICENSE LEXARIA\u2019S DEHYDRATECH  TM  , ON A SEMI-EXCLUSIVE BASIS, FOR A TERM OF FIVE (5) YEARS, TO PRODUCE A LINE OF CANNABIS-INFUSED ALCOHOL-FREE BEVERAGES FOR CANADIAN DISTRIBUTION, FOLLOWING REGULATORY APPROVAL.  THE CONTINUATION OF OUR BUSINESS INTERESTS IN THESE SECTORS IS DEPENDENT UPON OBTAINING FURTHER FINANCING, A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS OF DEVELOPMENT, AND, ULTIMATELY, ACHIEVING A PROFITABLE LEVEL OF OPERATIONS. THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES BY US COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT DILUTION IN THE EQUITY INTERESTS OF OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS. OBTAINING COMMERCIAL LOANS, ASSUMING THOSE LOANS WOULD BE AVAILABLE, WILL INCREASE OUR LIABILITIES AND FUTURE CASH COMMITMENTS.  WE ARE NOT YET PROFITABLE AND HAVE NOT YET DEMONSTRATED OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES FROM OUR BUSINESS PLAN. WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CORPORATE FUNDS IF OUR EXISTING CAPITAL IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE COMPANY UNTIL POTENTIAL FUTURE PROFITABILITY IS REACHED. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN FURTHER FUNDS REQUIRED FOR OUR LONG-TERM OPERATIONS. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL OPERATING CAPITAL DURING OUR FISCAL 2019 YEAR, BUT DO EXPECT TO REQUIRE CAPITAL IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH OUR OWN, FEDERALLY LICENSED CANADIAN LABORATORY ON-PREMISES FOR OUR INTERNAL R&D PURPOSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US WHEN NEEDED OR, IF AVAILABLE, THAT IT CAN BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN THE ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON A TIMELY BASIS, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS AS PLANNED, AND WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET OUR OTHER LONGER-TERM OBLIGATIONS AS THEY BECOME DUE. IN SUCH EVENT, WE COULD BE FORCED TO SCALE DOWN OR PERHAPS EVEN CEASE OUR OPERATIONS. THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER WE CAN OBTAIN ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FINANCING IF WE DO IN FACT REQUIRE IT.  OUR BUSINESS PLAN ANTICIPATES THAT WE WILL HIRE THREE TO SIX EMPLOYEES AND INCLUDES NEW OFFICE SPACE THAT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN ORDER TO FACILITATE A FEDERALLY LICENSED CANADIAN LABORATORY ON-PREMISES FOR OUR INTERNAL R&D PURPOSES. WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE CONTRACTED THIRD PARTIES FOR MOST OF OUR PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION NEEDS, INSTEAD FOCUSING OUR CAPITAL ON HIGHER VALUE ADDED ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS SUCH AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND SCIENTIFIC TESTING. WE HAVE NO CURRENT PLANS TO BUILD OUR OWN PRODUCTION FACILITY.  OUR COMPANY RELIES ON THE BUSINESS EXPERIENCE OF OUR EXISTING MANAGEMENT, ON THE TECHNICAL ABILITIES OF CONSULTING EXPERTS, AND ON THE TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL ABILITIES OF ITS OPERATING PARTNER COMPANIES TO EVALUATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.  30  COMPETITION  THE LEGAL MARIJUANA INDUSTRY IS COMPRISED OF SEVERAL SUB-SECTORS, AND IS LEGAL UNDER DIFFERENT GUIDELINES IN MANY STATES THOUGH IT REMAINS ILLEGAL UNDER MOST FEDERAL LAWS. NOTWITHSTANDING, THE OVERALL SECTOR IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED TO BE ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING IN THE USA, WITH STATE-LEGAL REVENUE OF OVER $8 BILLION IN 2016. INDEPENDENT PROJECTIONS AND PUBLICIZED REPORTS EXPECT REVENUE OF $20 BILLION OR MORE IN 2020, BOTH AS THE SECTOR GAINS IN CREDIBILITY AND ACCEPTANCE, AND AS MORE AND MORE STATES LEGALIZE EITHER MEDICAL USE OR ADULT RECREATIONAL USE; OR BOTH. IN ANY FAST GROWING INDUSTRY, COMPETITION IS EXPECTED TO BE BOTH STRONG AND ALSO DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE AS TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE COMPETITIVE THREATS. WHILE WE ARE AN EARLY ADOPTER WITHIN THE CANNABINOID DELIVERY SECTOR, THERE ARE ALREADY REPORTS OF MORE THAN 300 PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT HAVE CLAIMED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE SECTOR IN SOME FASHION; AND AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF PRIVATE COMPANIES. OUR CURRENT STRATEGIES MAY PROVE TO BE INEFFECTIVE AS THE SECTOR GROWS AND MATURES, AND IF SO, WE WILL HAVE TO ADAPT QUICKLY TO CHANGING SECTORAL CIRCUMSTANCES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY INTENDS TO AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE TECHNOLOGY OUT-LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES NOT ONLY WITHIN THE CANNABINOIDS SECTOR WHERE IT IS ALREADY ACTIVE, BUT ALSO ACROSS OTHER SECTORS WHERE ITS DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY IS PATENT ALLOWED AND/OR PENDING, INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE VITAMIN AND SUPPLEMENTS SECTOR, THE PAIN RELIEF SECTOR AND THE NICOTINE PRODUCTS SECTOR.  COMPETITION IN ALTERNATIVE HEALTH SECTORS AND IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS IN THE USA IS FIERCE. WE EXPECT TO ENCOUNTER COMPETITIVE THREATS FROM EXISTING PARTICIPANTS IN THE SECTOR AND NEW ENTRANTS. ALTHOUGH POVIVA TEA LLC HAS FILED PATENT APPLICATIONS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT PATENTS BEYOND THOSE ALREADY ISSUED WILL BE GRANTED NOR THAT OTHER FIRMS MAY NOT FILE SUPERIOR PATENTS PENDING. FOOD SUPPLEMENTS, ORGANIC FOODS, AND HEALTH FOOD MARKETS ARE ALL WELL ESTABLISHED AND OUR COMPANY WILL FACE MANY CHALLENGES TRYING TO ENTER THESE MARKETS. LEXARIA IS ALSO AWARE OF VARIOUS COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES THAT EXIST IN THE MARKETPLACE THAT CLAIM TO ALSO ENHANCE THE BIOABSORPTION OF CANNABINOIDS AS LEXARIA HAS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH REPEATED  IN VITRO  AND  IN VIVO  SCIENTIFIC TESTING WITH ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY. BY AND LARGE, THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALL FORMS OF NANOTECHNOLOGY THAT GENERALLY CLAIM TO ENABLE THE FORMATION OF MICROENCAPSULATED MICROEMULSIONS OF CANNABINOID ACTIVE INGREDIENTS. THESE TECHNOLOGIES CAN ENABLE EXCEPTIONAL WATER SOLUBILITY OF CANNABINOID INGREDIENTS AND CAN IMPART IMPROVED INTESTINAL BIOABSORPTION AS A RESULT.  HOWEVER, IT IS LEXARIA\u2019S BELIEF THAT ITS PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY OFFERS A HOST OF BENEFITS BEYOND WHAT COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES CAN OFFER, INCLUDING SUPERIOR ORAL PALATABILITY, A MORE APPEALING AND ALL-NATURAL INGREDIENT COMPOSITIONAL PROFILE FROM A FOOD AND BEVERAGE FORMULATION PERSPECTIVE AND SUPERIOR SCALABILITY AND COST EFFECTIVENESS FROM A MANUFACTURING PERSPECTIVE. LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT ITS DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY IS, THEREFORE, SIGNIFICANTLY DISTINGUISHED FROM COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES IN THESE RESPECTS, WITH A VIEW TO GROWING THE BREADTH AND NUMBER OF LICENSEES THAT WILL ADOPT ITS TECHNOLOGY FOR THEIR PRODUCT OFFERINGS GOING FORWARD. LEXARIA BELIEVES THAT THESE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES TOGETHER WITH ITS WEALTH OF SCIENTIFIC DATA SHOWING NOTEWORTHY BIOABSORPTION ENHANCEMENTS WITH ITS DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY CONSTITUTE A COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITION FOR ITS PROSPECTIVE LICENSEES, AND IT INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS NOT ONLY WITHIN THE CANNABINOIDS EDIBLES SECTOR WHERE IT IS ALREADY ACTIVE, BUT ALSO IN THE VARIOUS OTHER BIOACTIVE INGREDIENT SECTORS IDENTIFIED IN ITS ISSUED AND PENDING PATENT APPLICATIONS.  COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATION  OVER 30 STATES IN THE USA HAVE PASSED SOME FORM OF LEGISLATION RELATED TO THAT STATE\u2019S PERMISSION TO GROW, CULTIVATE, SELL OR USE MARIJUANA EITHER FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES OR FOR RECREATIONAL OR \u201cADULT USE\u201d PURPOSES; OR BOTH. THE VARIOUS STATE LEGISLATION IS NOT NECESSARILY HARMONIOUS WITH ONE ANOTHER, LEADING TO POTENTIAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN STATE LAWS. IT IS MOST OFTEN NOT LEGAL TO TRANSPORT CANNABIS-RELATED PRODUCTS ACROSS STATE LINES.  LEXARIA DOES NOT \u201cTOUCH THE PLANT\u201d IN ANY LOCATION WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF THE USA. WE COMPLY WITH FEDERAL LAW THAT PROVIDES FOR CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL (INDUSTRIAL) HEMP AND CERTAIN BYPRODUCTS TO BE MANUFACTURED AND SOLD IN THE US. THE DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY MAY HAVE APPLICATIONS WITHIN THE LEGAL MARIJUANA SECTOR AND WE MAY SEEK TO LICENSE THAT TECHNOLOGY TO COMPANIES THAT HAVE MET AND COMPLY WITH STATE REGULATIONS FOR THE SALE OR DISTRIBUTION OF CANNABIS RELATED PRODUCTS IN ANY PARTICULAR JURISDICTION.  LEXARIA\u2019S POSITION IS THAT, JUST AS A TELEPHONE COMPANY PROVIDES COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, AND AN ELECTRIC COMPANY PROVIDES ELECTRICAL POWER, OUR PROVISION OF TECHNOLOGICAL SERVICES TO A STATE-LEGAL CANNABIS COMPANY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REQUIRED REGULATIONS.  31  LEXARIA\u2019S PATENTED DEHYDRATECH  TM  TECHNOLOGY MAY ALSO HAVE APPLICATION IN COMPLETELY SEPARATE SECTORS SUCH AS VITAMINS, NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES, AND NICOTINE. WE HAVE NO PRODUCTS NOR OPERATIONS IN ANY OF THESE SECTORS TODAY, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE COMMENCED FORMULATION DEVELOPMENT FOR RESEARCH AND VALIDATION PURPOSES IN EACH OF THESE AREAS. IF WE ENTER ANY OF THESE SECTORS AT ANY TIME, WE WILL BE EXPOSED TO AND OF NECESSITY WILL HAVE TO COMPLY WITH, ALL LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS IN EACH OF THOSE SECTORS. AS A RESULT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF LEXARIA BEING INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF DISPARATE BUSINESS SECTORS, COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE FROM OUR COMPANY.  THE US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CONTEMPLATING THE 2018 FARM BILL THAT MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACTS ON INDUSTRY SEGMENTS THAT WE OPERATE AND HAVE PRODUCTS IN AND POTENTIALLY CHANGE SOME OF THE REGULATORY COMPLIANCE RISKS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. THE BILL INCLUDES LIFTING RESTRICTIONS ON ADVERTISING, MARKETING, BANKING AND OTHER FINANCIAL SERVICES AS WELL AS ALLOWING INTERSTATE COMMERCE FOR HEMP AND HEMP-DERIVED CANNABIDIOL (CBD), REMOVE BARRIERS FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTIONS UNDER FEDERAL LAW SUCH AS PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS, AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER MEASURES THAT MAY POSITIVELY IMPACT THESE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS OVERALL. THE IMPACT THE BILL MAY HAVE ON OTHER REGULATORY BODIES AND THEIR REGULATIONS WILL REQUIRE ONGOING MONITORING TO DETERMINE THE OUTCOME AND TIMING OF ANY REVISIONS. SUBSEQUENT TO NOVEMBER 30  TH  2018, THE 2018 FARM BILL WAS PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW.  SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS  WE HAVE LEASED A NEW HEAD-OFFICE LOCATION IN KELOWNA, CANADA, THAT INCLUDES THE PURCHASE AND CONSTRUCTION OF OFFICE EQUIPMENT, FURNITURE, COMPUTERS, AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS. WE ARE ALSO IN-PROGRESS OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FEDERAL LICENSED CANADIAN LABORATORY ON-PREMISES FOR OUR INTERNAL R&D PURPOSES, FOR WHICH A LICENSE APPLICATION HAS BEEN FILED WITH HEALTH CANADA. FINAL COSTS ARE NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME BUT COULD AMOUNT TO $400,000 - $600,000.  CONTRACTORS  WE PRIMARILY USE SUB-CONTRACTORS AND CONSULTANTS IN THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSING, AND ALTERNATIVE HEALTH PRODUCT SECTORS. WE ANTICIPATE THE ADDITION OF THREE EMPLOYEES DURING OUR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER AND ADDITIONAL RESEARCH PERSONNEL UPON LICENSE APPROVAL FROM HEALTH CANADA FOR THE RESEARCH LAB. WE PRIMARILY ENGAGE WITH CONSULTANTS TO SERVE OUR EXECUTIVE NEEDS.  THE COMPANY HAD AN AGREEMENT WITH CAB FOR A CONSULTING FEE OF $12,000 PER MONTH. THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT IS TWO YEARS BUT CAN BE TERMINATED BY EITHER PARTY BY PROVIDING TWO MONTHS NOTICE, WHICH CONTINUES ON A MONTH TO MONTH BASIS. THE COMPANY MAY PAY MR. BUNKA A BONUS FROM TIME TO TIME, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION. MR. BUNKA WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE COMMON STOCK-BASED AND STOCK OPTION BASED BONUSES UPON ACHIEVING CERTAIN MILESTONES DURING THE TIME OF HIS CONSULTANCY WITH THE COMPANY. THESE MILESTONES ARE DURING THE FIRST 12 MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT WITH CAB.  REVENUE INCENTIVE MILESTONES (REVENUE INCENTIVES \u201cA\u201d)  \u00b7  UPON THE COMPANY ACHIEVING NON-REFUNDABLE REVENUES OF $200,000 TO ANY SINGLE CUSTOMER IN ANY CONSECUTIVE 60-DAY PERIOD, CAB WOULD BE ENTITLED TO AN AWARD OF 100,000 RESTRICTED COMMON SHARES OF THE COMPANY AND AFTER THE FIRST 12-MONTH PERIOD, EXPIRING AFTER 24 MONTHS OF THE AMENDED AGREEMENT, UPON THE COMPANY ACHIEVING NON-REFUNDABLE REVENUES OF $200,000 TO ANY SINGLE CUSTOMER IN ANY CONSECUTIVE 60-DAY PERIOD, CAB WOULD BE ENTITLED TO AN AWARD OF 50,000 RESTRICTED COMMON SHARES OF THE COMPANY. THESE AWARDS ARE LIMITED TO ONE PAYMENT PER CUSTOMER DURING THE 24-MONTH PERIOD BUT PAYABLE FOR EACH CUSTOMER THAT MEETS THE REVENUE THRESHOLDS.  \u00b7  UPON THE COMPANY ACHIEVING NON-REFUNDABLE REVENUES OF $500,000 IN ANY FISCAL QUARTER WOULD RESULT IN AN AWARD TO CAB OF 200,000 COMMON SHARES OF THE COMPANY AND AFTER THE FIRST 12 MONTHS, EXPIRING 24 MONTHS AFTER THE AMENDED AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY ACHIEVING NON-REFUNDABLE REVENUES OF $500,000 IN ANY FISCAL QUARTER WOULD RESULT IN AN AWARD TO CAB OF 100,000 COMMON SHARES OF THE COMPANY. THESE AWARDS ARE LIMITED TO ONE PAYMENT PER FISCAL QUARTER.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MILESTONES (IP INCENTIVES \u201cB\u201d)  \u00b7  DURING THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT, FOR EACH PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION SUBSTANTIVELY DEVISED BY CAB AND SUCCESSFULLY CREATED, WRITTEN AND FILED WITH THE US PATENT OFFICE FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY, CAB WILL BE ENTITLED TO AN AWARD OF 250,000 RESTRICTED COMMON SHARES OF THE COMPANY.  32  ON JULY 1, 2018 THE COMPANY EXECUTED AN UPDATED THREE-YEAR CONSULTING CONTRACT WITH M&E SERVICES LTD. (M&E), A COMPANY WHOLLY OWNED BY MR. ALLAN SPISSINGER, WITH MONTHLY COMPENSATION OF CAD$12,000 INCLUDING AN 8% ANNUAL INCREASE SUPERSEDING THE PREVIOUS CAD$8,000 PER MONTH CONTRACT THAT INCLUDED 200,000 INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISABLE AT $0.37. THE COMPANY MAY PAY MR. SPISSINGER A BONUS FROM TIME TO TIME, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION. MR. SPISSINGER WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL COMMON STOCK-BASED AND STOCK OPTION BASED BONUSES UPON ACHIEVING CERTAIN MILESTONES DURING THE TIME OF HIS CONSULTANCY WITH THE COMPANY. THESE MILESTONES ARE.  \u00b7  REVENUE INCENTIVES \u201cA\u201d AS DEFINED ABOVE.  THE COMPANY APPOINTED MR. JOHN DOCHERTY AS PRESIDENT OF LEXARIA EFFECTIVE APRIL 15, 2015. ON MARCH 1, 2017, THE COMPANY EXECUTED A TWENTY FOUR MONTH CONSULTING CONTRACT WITH DOCHERTY MANAGEMENT LIMITED, SOLELY OWNED BY MR. JOHN DOCHERTY WITH MONTHLY COMPENSATION OF CAD$15,000 PLUS APPLICABLE TAXES, SUPERSEDING THE PREVIOUS AGREEMENT WITH MONTHLY COMPENSATION OF CAD$12,500 PLUS APPLICABLE TAXES. THE COMPANY MAY PAY MR. DOCHERTY A BONUS FROM TIME TO TIME, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION. PURSUANT TO THE PREVIOUS AGREEMENT, MR. DOCHERTY RECEIVED 800,000 STOCK OPTIONS AND 924,000 RESTRICTED COMMON SHARES OF THE COMPANY. MR. DOCHERTY WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL COMMON STOCK-BASED AND STOCK OPTION BASED BONUSES UPON ACHIEVING CERTAIN MILESTONES DURING THE TIME OF HIS CONSULTANCY WITH THE COMPANY. THESE MILESTONES ARE DURING THE FIRST 12 MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT WITH DOCHERTY MANAGEMENT LTD..  \u00b7  REVENUE INCENTIVES \u201cA\u201d AS DEFINED ABOVE.  \u00b7  IP INCENTIVES \u201cB\u201d AS DEFINED ABOVE.  ON JUNE 19, 2017, THE COMPANY EXECUTED A CONTRACT WITH ALEX BLANCHARD CAPITAL AS MANAGER FOR INVESTOR RELATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS. THE AGREEMENT IS FOR SIX MONTHS CONTINUING MONTH TO MONTH AND MAY BE TERMINATED THEREAFTER WITH ONE MONTH\u2019S NOTICE FOR CAD$7,500 PER MONTH. MR. BLANCHARD WAS GRANTED 200,000 WARRANTS EXERCISABLE AT $0.29 AND 300,000 STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISABLE AT $0.295 VESTING 100,000 OPTIONS AT 1ST \u2013 3RD ANNIVERSARIES OF THE CONTRACT PROVIDED THAT THE CONTRACT IS NOT TERMINATED. MR. BLANCHARD WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL COMMON STOCK-BASED AND STOCK OPTION BASED BONUSES UPON ACHIEVING CERTAIN MILESTONES DURING THE TIME OF HIS CONSULTANCY WITH THE COMPANY. THESE MILESTONES ARE DURING THE FIRST 12 MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT WITH ALEX BLANCHARD CAPITAL.  \u00b7  REVENUE INCENTIVES \u201cA\u201d AS DEFINED ABOVE.  WE ARE PLANNING AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PERSONNEL OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTH PERIOD TO ENHANCE CAPACITY AND, SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THE LAB FACILITY, FOR R&D PURPOSES. WE DO AND WILL CONTINUE TO OUTSOURCE CONTRACT EMPLOYMENT AS NEEDED. ADDITIONAL CAPACITY MAY BE REQUIRED WITH PRODUCT ADVANCEMENT OR RETAIL ACCEPTANCE OF OUR NEW PRODUCTS, WE MAY NEED TO RETAIN ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL PARTICULARLY IN THE FIELDS OF PRODUCT MANUFACTURING, DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO ACCURATELY PROJECT POTENTIAL NEEDS INTO THE FUTURE BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT OCCUR.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  LEXARIA INCURRED $96,973 (2017 $110,392) IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES DURING THE PERIOD ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2018. SPECIFIC R&D PROGRAMS ARE IN ONGOING DEVELOPMENT AND WILL BE TIGHTLY RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL ABILITY TO UNDERTAKE EACH RESEARCH PHASE FOR EACH MOLECULE. DUE TO OUR EXPANDING PORTFOLIO COVERAGE, WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXAMINE ACCELERATED TIMETABLE OPTIONS FOR TESTING, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S PLANS TO INCLUDE  IN VITRO  ABSORPTION TESTS OF OUR PATENTED TECHNOLOGY OF MOLECULES SUCH AS: VITAMIN E, IBUPROFEN, AND NICOTINE ALLOWED US TO PERFORM TESTING ON NICOTINE WITH POSITIVE RESULTS. OUR PLAN TO CONDUCT OUR FIRST EVER  IN VIVO  ABSORPTION TESTS ON CBD ALSO YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS. ONGOING TESTING PLANS ARE PROCEEDING TO FURTHER DEFINE MOLECULAR COMPATIBILITY, ABSORPTION RATES, TIMING AND VIABLE FORMATS OF DELIVERY.  DEPENDING ON HOW MANY OF THESE TESTS ARE UNDERTAKEN, IT COULD REQUIRE BUDGETS OF AS MUCH AS $1,000,000, OR AS LITTLE AS $65,000, TO DO SO. IT IS IN OUR BEST INTERESTS TO REMAIN FLEXIBLE AT THIS EARLY STAGE OF OUR R&D EFFORTS IN ORDER TO CAPITALIZE ON POTENTIAL NOVEL FINDINGS FROM EARLY-STAGE TESTS AND THUS RE-DIRECT RESEARCH INTO SPECIFIC AVENUES THAT OFFER THE MOST REWARD.  33  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT ARE MATERIAL TO STOCKHOLDERS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED IN THE UNITED STATES. PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENT\u2019S APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. WE BELIEVE THAT UNDERSTANDING THE BASIS AND NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED WITH THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS CRITICAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIALS.  EQUIPMENT  EQUIPMENT IS STATED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER ITS USEFUL LIFE.  PATENTS  CAPITALIZED PATENT COSTS REPRESENT LEGAL COSTS INCURRED TO ESTABLISH PATENTS. WHEN PATENTS REACH A MATURE STAGE, ANY ASSOCIATED LEGAL COSTS ARE COMPRISED MOSTLY OF MAINTENANCE FEES AND ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. CAPITALIZED PATENT COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE PATENT.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  PRODUCT REVENUE  REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HEALTH PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS UPON SHIPMENT. THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS SALES NET OF THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL SALES RETURNS. SALES TAX COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS IS EXCLUDED FROM NET SALES.  LICENSING REVENUE FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR LICENSE FEES AT A POINT IN TIME FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OUR PATENTED LIPID NUTRIENT INFUSION TECHNOLOGY DEHYDRATECHTM FOR INFUSING ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS, TO THE LICENSEE, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS ON DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTATION.  USAGE FEES FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR USAGE FEES WHEN USAGE OF OUR DEHYDRATECHTM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OCCURS BY LICENSEES INFUSING AND ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENT INTO ONE OR MORE OF THEIR PRODUCT LINES FOR SALE.  GOING CONCERN  WE HAVE SUFFERED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS. THE CONTINUATION OF OUR COMPANY AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR COMPANY ATTAINING AND MAINTAINING PROFITABLE OPERATIONS AND/OR RAISING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENT RELATING TO THE RECOVERY AND CLASSIFICATION OF RECORDED ASSET AMOUNTS OR THE AMOUNT AND CLASSIFICATION OF LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SHOULD OUR COMPANY DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS. THE RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS AND NET CAPITAL DEFICIENCY RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  34  RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  IN JANUARY 2016, FASB ISSUED AN ASU, SUBTOPIC 82510, TO AMEND CERTAIN ASPECTS OF RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT, PRESENTATION, AND DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. MOST PROMINENT AMONG THE AMENDMENTS IS THE REQUIREMENT FOR CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, TO BE RECOGNIZED THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS RATHER THAN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE STANDARD SEPTEMBER 1, 2018. THE IMPACT WAS NOT MATERIAL AND THE $14,247 IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WAS INCLUDED IN INCOME IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  IN FEBRUARY 2016 FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 201602, LEASES (TOPIC 842) WHICH SUPERSEDES FASB ASC TOPIC 840, LEASES (TOPIC 840) AND PROVIDES PRINCIPLES FOR THE RECOGNITION, MEASUREMENT, PRESENTATION, AND DISCLOSURE OF LEASES FOR BOTH LESSEES AND THE LESSORS. THE NEW STANDARD REQUIRES THE LESSEES TO APPLY A DUAL APPROACH, CLASSIFYING LEASES AS EITHER FINANCE OR OPERATING LEASES BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF WHETHER OR NOT THE LEASE IS EFFECTIVELY A FINANCED PURCHASE BY THE LESSEE. THE CLASSIFICATION WILL DETERMINE WHETHER LEASE EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD OR ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE, RESPECTIVELY. A LESSEE IS ALSO REQUIRED TO RECORD A RIGHT OF USE ASSET AND A LEASE LIABILITY FOR ALL LEASES WITH A TERM OF GREATER THAN TWELVE MONTHS REGARDLESS OF CLASSIFICATION. LEASES WITH A TERM OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR SIMILAR TO EXISTING GUIDANCE FOR OPERATING LEASES. THE STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED UPON ISSUANCE. WHEN ADOPTED, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THIS GUIDANCE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW STANDARD TO REPLACE THE INCURRED LOSS IMPAIRMENT METHODOLOGY IN CURRENT U.S. GAAP WITH A METHODOLOGY THAT REFLECTS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF A BROADER RANGE OF REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE INFORMATION TO INFORM CREDIT LOSS CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES. FOR TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, LOANS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO USE A FORWARD LOOKING EXPECTED LOSS MODEL RATHER THAN THE INCURRED LOSS MODEL FOR RECOGNIZING CREDIT LOSSES WHICH REFLECTS LOSSES THAT ARE PROBABLE. CREDIT LOSSES RELATING TO AVAILABLE FOR SALE DEBT SECURITIES WILL ALSO BE RECORDED THROUGH AN ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RATHER THAN AS A REDUCTION IN THE AMORTIZED COST BASIS OF THE SECURITIES. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR LEXARIA BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 1, 2020, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. APPLICATION OF THE AMENDMENTS IS THROUGH A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO DEFICIT AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE STANDARD ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 201802, INCOME STATEMENT\u2013REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220): RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH ALLOWS A RECLASSIFICATION FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO RETAINED EARNINGS FOR STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ENACTED BY THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON DECEMBER 22, 2017 (THE \u201c2017 TAX ACT\u201d). CONSEQUENTLY, THE AMENDMENTS ELIMINATE THE STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE 2017 TAX ACT AND WILL IMPROVE THE USEFULNESS OF INFORMATION REPORTED TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT USERS. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL ENTITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED, INCLUDING ADOPTION IN ANY INTERIM PERIOD, (1) FOR PUBLIC BUSINESS ENTITIES FOR REPORTING PERIODS FOR WHICH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN ISSUED AND (2) FOR ALL OTHER ENTITIES FOR REPORTING PERIODS FOR WHICH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN MADE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE EFFECT THIS ASU WILL HAVE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES, BUT DOES NOT EXPECT IT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 201807, COMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING. THIS IS A SIMPLIFICATION THAT INVOLVES SEVERAL ASPECTS OF ACCOUNTING FOR NONEMPLOYEE SHARE BASED PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF TOPIC 718 TO INCLUDE SHARE BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS FOR ACQUIRING GOODS AND SERVICES FROM NONEMPLOYEES. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR LEXARIA FOR SEPTEMBER 1, 2019. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT IT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  35  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND 2017  THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017, WHICH ARE INCLUDED HEREIN.  OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND 2017 AND THE CHANGES BETWEEN THOSE PERIODS FOR THE RESPECTIVE ITEMS ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30  2018  $THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30  2017  $CHANGE  BETWEEN THE  PERIODS  $SALES  22,209  24,635  (2,426  )  COST OF GOODS SOLD  2,158  6,099  (3,941  )  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  721,442  593,703  127,739  IMPAIRMENT OF INVENTORY  -  3,546  (3,546  )  NET LOSS  (701,391  )  (578,713  )  (122,678  )  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPORT A NET LOSS OF $701,391 FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO 2017 WHERE WE INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $578,713. DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE HIGHER COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017, WHICH IS A RESULT OF THE INCREASES IN CONSULTING EXPENSES TO ADDRESS ADDITIONAL INDUSTRY SEGMENTS AND INCREASES FOR PATENT AND TRADEMARK FILING COSTS. THESE INCREASES ARE IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS FOR EXECUTING OUR BUSINESS PLAN.  REVENUE WERE PRIMARILY BASED ON LICENSING USAGE FEES IN LINE WITH CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS, WHILE CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES REMAIN LOW DUE TO CHALLENGES IN SECURING EXPANSIVE DISTRIBUTION OPPORTUNITIES, PRODUCTION CHALLENGES AND PAYMENT PROCESSING CHANGES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURSUE MORE WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION POSSIBILITIES WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO UNLOCK MORE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER REVENUES.  THE TREND OF HEMP OIL FORTIFIED FOODS, AND HEMP SEED PRODUCTS, GAINING CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE CONTINUED AND PROVIDES A REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SALES COULD INCREASE. THOSE TRENDS SHOULD SUPPORT HIGHER POTENTIAL CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES. IN ADDITION, LEGISLATIVE TRENDS IN AMERICA AND IN MANY NATIONS AROUND THE WORLD SUCH AS CANADA AND THE UK ARE SUPPORTIVE OF ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HEMP-BASED FOODS AND SUPPLEMENTS SECTOR. THOSE TRENDS COULD SUPPORT HIGHER POTENTIAL CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES. RELEASE OF THE TURBOCBD  TM  PRODUCT WAS SUCCESSFUL BUT SALES WERE LIMITED BY CHANGES TO PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL. AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT THE COMPANY HAD EXTINGUISHED ITS SUPPLIES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS LIKE PROTEIN BARS AND THE LACK OF INVENTORY WAS ALSO A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CONSUMER PRODUCT SALES POTENTIAL.  FOR 2019 THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO DERIVE THE MAJORITY OF ITS REVENUES FROM TECHNOLOGY LICENSING TO THIRD PARTIES NOTING THAT IP TERRITORY FEES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN NEW DEFINITIVE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OCCUR AND IP USAGE FEES ARE DEPENDENT UP ON LICENSEES OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENTS THE TECHNOLOGY BASED UPON REGULATORY APPROVAL. CANADIAN REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR INGESTIBLE PRODUCTS IS ANTICIPATED WITHIN 12 MONTHS OF THE OCTOBER 17, 2018 LEGALIZATION OF RECREATIONAL CANNABIS IN THAT COUNTRY. AT AUGUST 31, 2015 THE COMPANY HAD ZERO TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENTS ENTERED. BY AUGUST 31, 2016 WE HAD ENTERED SEVERAL LOI\u2019S OR DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY OUT-LICENSING. DURING THE PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SIX NEW LICENSING AGREEMENTS THAT INCREASED OUR IP LICENSING REVENUE AND WE EXPECT ADDITIONAL REVENUE WILL BE GENERATED FROM THE LICENSEES UTILIZING THE TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR PROCESSES FROM THE USAGE FEES AS THEIR PRODUCTION AND SALES OCCUR. IT IS THE COMPANY\u2019S VIEW THAT THE DECEMBER 9, 2017, GRANT OF PATENT US 9,839,612 B2, THE GRANTS OF US 9,972,680 B2 AND US 9,974,739 B2 DURING MAY 2018, THE SEPTEMBER 25, 2018 GRANT OF US 10,084,044 B2, THE OCTOBER 16, 2018 GRANT OF US 10,103,225 B2 AND ITS EXPANDING PATENT PORTFOLIO ARE POSITIVE STEPS IN ENABLING THE GENERATION OF MORE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES. AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED MORE THAN 10 FORMAL LETTERS OF INTENT OR DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS AND IS NEGOTIATING MORE.  36  WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT ALL OF THE LETTERS OF INTENT INTO WHICH WE ENTER WILL RESULT IN DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS WITH PAYING CUSTOMERS AND CANNOT PREDICT HOW MANY WILL. WE BELIEVE THAT STRENGTHENING AND EXPANDING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO AND CONDUCTING SUPPORTIVE R&D WILL JOINTLY CONTRIBUTE TO STRENGTHENING REVENUE PROSPECTS.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSISTENT BETWEEN THE COMPARISON PERIODS WITH SMALL DECREASES IN ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONS, AND TRAVEL, AND INCREASE TO ONGOING LEGAL FEES FOR PATENT AND TRADEMARK FILINGS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE COMPANY CONTINUED ITS INVESTMENT IN EXPANDING ITS PATENT AND TRADEMARK FILINGS AND BEGAN THE RENOVATIONS FOR THE NEW HEAD OFFICE LOCATION WITH IN-HOUSE HEALTH CANADA COMPLIANT RESEARCH LAB.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE COMPANY RAISED A TOTAL OF $1,649,190 FROM EQUITY ISSUANCES, RELATING TO THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT CLOSED IN OCTOBER 2018 AND THE ONGOING EXERCISES OF ITS OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS.  37", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Lexaria Bioscience Corp.", "CIK": 1348362, "Date": "2019-01-11T00:00:00", "Ticker": "LXRP", "Name": "Lexaria Corp", "Exchange": "OTC", "SIC": 1000.0, "Business": null, "Incorporated": "NV", "IRS": 202000871.0, "key": "20190111LXRP", "labelr1": -0.7874015748031503, "labelr2": 12.698412698412692, "labelr3": 4.2253521126760605, "labelr4": 7.4324324324324405, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5737533, "prof1": 0.42624670000000003, "return1&2": 0.8798900137482815, "return1&2&3": 0.8427115624631427, "return1&2&3&4": 0.7800775949827741, "return2": 0.873015873015873, "return1": 1.0078740157480317, "return3": 0.9577464788732394, "return4": 0.9256756756756755, "1_day_return": -0.7874015748031482, "cumulative_return1": 0.9304570292143568, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.9580598509210856, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.773939291355209, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.7825723503996724, "indexx": 19, "returnpred": 0.7874015748031503, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.026242720933164, "cumreturn1b": 0.9504894162452275, "cumreturn1c": 0.914201626105267, "cumreturndow": 1.0550352425512464, "cumreturnsp500": 1.053936667416719}, {"Unnamed: 0": 23, "level_0": 23, "index": 34672, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  GENERAL  TO ALL PERIODS  THE  UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS INCLUDE GREYSTONE LOGISTICS, INC., AND ITS TWO WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, GREYSTONE MANUFACTURING,  L.L.C. (\u201cGSM\u201d) AND PLASTIC PALLET PRODUCTION, INC. (\u201cPPP\u201d). GREYSTONE ALSO CONSOLIDATES ITS VARIABLE INTEREST  ENTITY, GREYSTONE REAL ESTATE, L.L.C. (\u201cGRE\u201d). ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.  REFERENCES  TO FISCAL YEAR 2019 REFER TO THE SIX MONTHS AND THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018. REFERENCES TO FISCAL YEAR 2018 REFER TO  THE SIX MONTHS AND THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017.  SALES  GREYSTONE\u2019S  PRIMARY FOCUS IS TO PROVIDE QUALITY PLASTIC PALLETS TO ITS EXISTING CUSTOMERS WHILE CONTINUING ITS MARKETING EFFORTS TO BROADEN  ITS CUSTOMER BASE. GREYSTONE\u2019S EXISTING CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND ENGAGED IN THE BEVERAGE,  PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER INDUSTRIES. GREYSTONE HAS GENERATED, AND PLANS TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE, INTEREST IN ITS PALLETS BY ATTENDING  TRADE SHOWS SPONSORED BY INDUSTRY SEGMENTS THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM GREYSTONE\u2019S PRODUCTS. GREYSTONE HOPES TO GAIN WIDER PRODUCT  ACCEPTANCE BY MARKETING THE CONCEPT THAT THE WIDESPREAD USE OF PLASTIC PALLETS COULD GREATLY REDUCE THE DESTRUCTION OF TREES ON  A WORLDWIDE BASIS. GREYSTONE\u2019S MARKETING IS CONDUCTED THROUGH CONTRACT DISTRIBUTORS, ITS PRESIDENT AND OTHER EMPLOYEES.  15  PERSONNEL  GREYSTONE  HAD APPROXIMATELY 185 AND 167 FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  SIX  MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017  SALES  SALES  FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WERE $32,939,240 COMPARED TO $20,009,177 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR AN INCREASE OF $12,930,063. THE INCREASE  IN PALLET SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SALES GROWTH WITH A PALLET LEASING COMPANY, ONE OF GREYSTONE\u2019S  MAJOR CUSTOMERS.  GREYSTONE  HAS THREE MAJOR CUSTOMERS WHO ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 84% AND 73% OF SALES IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. PALLET  SALES TO GREYSTONE\u2019S MAJOR CUSTOMERS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 NEED WHICH MAY VARY BY PERIOD. GREYSTONE  IS NOT ABLE TO PREDICT THE FUTURE NEEDS OF THESE MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND WILL CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO GROW SALES THROUGH THE ADDITION  OF NEW CUSTOMERS DEVELOPED THROUGH GREYSTONE\u2019S MARKETING EFFORTS.  COST  OF SALES  COST  OF SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS $28,801,518, OR 87% OF SALES, COMPARED TO $16,976,241, OR 85% OF SALES, IN FISCAL  YEAR 2018. THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME THAT GREYSTONE HAS EXPERIENCED DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS HAS HAD A DIRECT  EFFECT ON PRODUCTION COSTS RESULTING IN THE INCREASE IN THE RATIO OF COST OF SALES TO SALES FROM FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO 2019. START-UP  COSTS TO ACCOMMODATE THE GROWTH WAS A FACTOR. FURTHER, CERTAIN PRODUCTS ARE MORE LABOR INTENSIVE WHICH AFFECTS THE RELATIONSHIP  OF COST OF SALES TO SALES.  IN  ADDITION, GREYSTONE\u2019S ABILITY TO PROCESS UNREFINED RECYCLED PLASTIC RESIN HAS BEEN LIMITED DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE NEED  FOR REFINED PLASTIC RESIN FOR PRODUCTION OF PALLETS HAS EXCEEDED GREYSTONE\u2019S CURRENT CAPACITY. MACHINERY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL  CAPACITY WAS ANTICIPATED ON BEING INSTALLED DURING THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, BUT HAS SINCE BEEN DELAYED TO FEBRUARY  2019. ADDITIONALLY, MACHINERY TO AUTOMATE CERTAIN PRODUCTION LINES WHICH WILL IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS FOR PRODUCTION LABOR  AS WELL AS REDUCE LABOR COSTS IS EXPECTED TO BE INSTALLED IN FEBRUARY 2019.  GENERAL,  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL,  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $1,792,741 IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $1,452,416 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR AN INCREASE  OF $340,325, OR APPROXIMATELY 23%. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER FISCAL YEAR 2018 RESULTS PRINCIPALLY FROM INCREASED COSTS  RELATED TO ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL.  OTHER  INCOME (EXPENSES)  OTHER  INCOME WAS $5,290 AND $12,069 IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE SOURCE OF OTHER INCOME IS THE SALE OF SCRAP MATERIAL.  16  INTEREST  EXPENSE WAS $848,318 AND $658,736 IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018 FOR AN INCREASE OF $189,582. THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE  IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER FISCAL YEAR 2018 IS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DEBT AND A 1.00% INCREASE IN THE PRIME RATE OF  INTEREST FROM NOVEMBER 30, 2017 TO NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  PROVISION  FOR INCOME TAXES  THE  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES WAS $440,100 AND $259,500 IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES DOES NOT INCLUDE THE INCOME FROM THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AS THE ENTITY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE INCOME TAX RETURNS OF  GREYSTONE AND THE TAXABLE INCOME OF THE ENTITY IS PASSED-THROUGH TO THE RESPECTIVE OWNERS.  BASED  UPON A REVIEW OF ITS INCOME TAX FILING POSITIONS, GREYSTONE BELIEVES THAT ITS POSITIONS WOULD BE SUSTAINED UPON AN AUDIT BY THE  INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT WOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE TO ITS FINANCIAL POSITION.  THEREFORE, NO RESERVES FOR UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS HAVE BEEN RECORDED.  NET  INCOME  GREYSTONE  RECORDED NET INCOME OF $1,061,853 IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $674,353 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 PRIMARILY FOR THE REASONS  DISCUSSED ABOVE.  NET  INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS  NET  INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS $730,281, OR $0.03 PER SHARE, COMPARED TO $363,371,  OR $0.01 PER SHARE, IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 PRIMARILY FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  THREE  MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017  SALES  SALES  FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WERE $14,733,130 COMPARED TO $9,722,102 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR AN INCREASE OF $5,011,028. THE INCREASE IN  PALLET SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALES GROWTH WITH THE PALLET LEASING COMPANY.  SALES  TO GREYSTONE\u2019S THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 85% AND 73% OF SALES IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  GREYSTONE IS NOT ABLE TO PREDICT THE FUTURE NEEDS OF THESE MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND WILL CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO GROW SALES THROUGH  THE ADDITION OF NEW CUSTOMERS DEVELOPED THROUGH GREYSTONE\u2019S MARKETING EFFORTS.  COST  OF SALES  COST  OF SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS $13,041,366, OR 89% OF SALES, COMPARED TO $8,588,065, OR 88% OF SALES, IN FISCAL  YEAR 2018. THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME THAT GREYSTONE HAS EXPERIENCED DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS HAS HAD A DIRECT  EFFECT ON PRODUCTION COSTS RESULTING IN THE INCREASE IN THE RATIO OF COST OF SALES TO SALES FROM FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO 2019. START-UP  COSTS TO ACCOMMODATE THE GROWTH WAS A FACTOR. FURTHER, CERTAIN PRODUCTS ARE MORE LABOR INTENSIVE WHICH AFFECTS THE RELATIONSHIP  OF COST OF SALES TO SALES.  17  IN  ADDITION, GREYSTONE\u2019S ABILITY TO PROCESS UNREFINED RECYCLED PLASTIC RESIN HAS BEEN LIMITED DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE NEED  FOR REFINED PLASTIC RESIN FOR PRODUCTION OF PALLETS HAS EXCEEDED GREYSTONE\u2019S CURRENT CAPACITY. MACHINERY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL  CAPACITY WAS ANTICIPATED ON BEING INSTALLED DURING THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, BUT HAS SINCE BEEN DELAYED TO FEBRUARY  2019. ADDITIONALLY, MACHINERY TO AUTOMATE CERTAIN PRODUCTION LINES WHICH WILL IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS FOR PRODUCTION LABOR  AS WELL AS REDUCE LABOR COSTS IS EXPECTED TO BE INSTALLED IN FEBRUARY 2019.  GENERAL,  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL,  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $853,650 IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $621,013 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR AN INCREASE  OF $232,637 OR 37%. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER FISCAL YEAR 2018 RESULTS PRINCIPALLY FROM INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO  ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL.  OTHER  INCOME (EXPENSES)  OTHER  INCOME WAS $3,021 AND $3,806 IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  INTEREST  EXPENSE WAS $435,690 IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $334,059 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR AN INCREASE OF $101,631. THE INCREASE IN  INTEREST EXPENSE IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER 2018 IS DUE PRINCIPALLY TO INCREASES IN THE PRIME RATE OF INTEREST, 5.25% AT NOVEMBER  30, 2018 COMPARED TO 4.25% AT NOVEMBER 30, 2017 AND INCREASES IN AMOUNT OF DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASES.  PROVISION  FOR INCOME TAXES  THE  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES WAS $108,500 AND $38,700 IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES DOES NOT INCLUDE THE INCOME FROM THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AS THE ENTITY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE INCOME TAX RETURNS OF  GREYSTONE AND THE TAXABLE INCOME FROM THIS ENTITY IS PASSED-THROUGH TO THE RESPECTIVE OWNERS.  BASED  UPON A REVIEW OF ITS INCOME TAX FILING POSITIONS, GREYSTONE BELIEVES THAT ITS POSITIONS WOULD BE SUSTAINED UPON AN AUDIT BY THE  INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT WOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE TO ITS FINANCIAL POSITION.  THEREFORE, NO RESERVES FOR UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS HAVE BEEN RECORDED.  NET  INCOME  GREYSTONE  RECORDED NET INCOME OF $296,945 IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF $144,071 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 PRIMARILY FOR  THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  18  NET  INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS  THE  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS $128,893, OR $0.00 PER SHARE, COMPARED A NET LOSS  TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF $(11,337), OR $(0.00) PER SHARE, IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 PRIMARILY FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  A  SUMMARY OF CASH FLOWS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 IS AS FOLLOWS.

TO PROVIDE FOR THE FUNDING TO MEET GREYSTONE\u2019S  OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018, GREYSTONE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE POSITIVE  OPERATING RESULTS OR EXPLORE VARIOUS OPTIONS INCLUDING ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM DEBT AND EQUITY FINANCING. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE  THAT GREYSTONE WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE POSITIVE OPERATING RESULTS OR BE ABLE TO RAISE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO MEET THESE OBLIGATIONS.  EFFECTIVE  AUGUST 10, 2018 AND DECEMBER 28, 2018, GREYSTONE AND IBC ENTERED INTO THE AMENDMENTS TO THE IBC LOAN AGREEMENT DATED JANUARY 31,  2014 WHICH PROVIDED FOR NEW FUNDING IN THE FORM OF AN ADVANCING LOAN IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,600,000 TO PURCHASE PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT  OF WHICH $3,357,465 HAD BEEN ADVANCED AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND INCREASING THE LINE OF CREDIT UNDER THE REVOLVING LOAN TO $4,000,000,  RESPECTIVELY. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019, PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $2.3 MILLION WAS ACQUIRED THROUGH A LEASING  ARRANGEMENT.  SUBSTANTIALLY  ALL OF THE FINANCING THAT GREYSTONE HAS RECEIVED THROUGH THE LAST FEW FISCAL YEARS RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM BANK NOTES WHICH ARE  GUARANTEED BY CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF GREYSTONE AND, FORMERLY, FROM LOANS PROVIDED CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF  GREYSTONE. GREYSTONE CONTINUES TO BE DEPENDENT UPON ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS TO PROVIDE AND/OR SECURE ADDITIONAL FINANCING AND  THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. AS SUCH, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT FUNDING WILL  BE AVAILABLE FOR GREYSTONE TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS.  19  GREYSTONE  HAS 50,000 OUTSTANDING SHARES OF CUMULATIVE 2003 PREFERRED STOCK WITH A LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF $5,000,000 AND A PREFERRED DIVIDEND  RATE OF THE PRIME RATE OF INTEREST PLUS 3.25%.

WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS NATIONWIDE ACROSS THE U.S. AND, TO A MUCH LESSER EXTENT, INTO CANADA, MEXICO, AND CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, DELIVERING THEM PRIMARILY BY TRUCK, USING COMMON OR CONTRACT CARRIERS.

THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES WAS DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED OVER THE COURSE OF THE PRIOR YEAR TO RECOVER THE ESCALATION IN RAW MATERIAL COSTS. SHIPMENTS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER WERE UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED BY ADVERSE WEATHER IN MANY REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY AND CONSTRUCTION PROJECT DELAYS TOGETHER WITH AN INCREASE IN LOW-PRICED IMPORT COMPETITION.  GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DECREASED 5.9% TO $11.0 MILLION, OR 10.5% OF NET SALES, FROM $11.7 MILLION, OR 11.9% OF NET SALES, IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER DUE TO HIGHER MANUFACTURING COSTS ($2.4 MILLION) AND LOWER SHIPMENTS ($2.1 MILLION) PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SPREADS BETWEEN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS ($4.2 MILLION). THE INCREASE IN SPREADS WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES ($22.8 MILLION) PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS ($18.4 MILLION) AND FREIGHT EXPENSE ($207,000).  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE (\u201cSG&A EXPENSE\u201d) FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 INCREASED 13.4% TO $6.5 MILLION, OR 6.3% OF NET SALES, FROM $5.8 MILLION, OR 5.9% OF NET SALES IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RELATIVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGES IN THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES ($788,000) PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSE ($334,000). THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES DECREASED $532,000 IN THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF $256,000 IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER DUE TO THE CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS. THE DECREASE IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY LOWER INCENTIVE PLAN EXPENSE BASED ON OUR WEAKER RESULTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER.  OTHER INCOME  OTHER INCOME OF $829,000 FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A NET GAIN FROM THE DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ($709,000).  17  INCOME TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 INCREASED TO 23.5% FROM (36.8%) FOR THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE PRIOR YEAR RATE REFLECTS A $3.7 MILLION GAIN ON THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE LOWER CORPORATE TAX RATE ENACTED UNDER THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT IN DECEMBER 2017. EXCLUDING THE DEFERRED TAX GAIN, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 24.9% IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER REFLECTING THE REDUCTION IN THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE TO 21% FROM 35% FOR THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2018.  NET EARNINGS  NET EARNINGS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DECREASED TO $4.1 MILLION ($0.21 PER DILUTED SHARE) FROM $8.1 MILLION ($0.42 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT AND INCREASE IN SG&A EXPENSE TOGETHER WITH THE PRIOR YEAR INCOME TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO ENACTMENT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 29,  DECEMBER 30,  2018  2017  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED FOR) OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(22,768  )  $14,764  NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (5,663  )  (9,533  )  NET CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (7  )  -  NET WORKING CAPITAL  125,265  97,109  TOTAL DEBT  -  -  PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CAPITAL  -  -  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY  $245,382  $212,110  PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CAPITAL  100.0%  100.0%  TOTAL CAPITAL (TOTAL DEBT + SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY)  $245,382  $212,110  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OPERATING ACTIVITIES USED $22.8 MILLION OF CASH DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY FROM NET EARNINGS ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS TOGETHER WITH A NET DECREASE IN THE WORKING CAPITAL COMPONENTS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORIES, AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES. NET WORKING CAPITAL USED $31.2 MILLION OF CASH DUE TO A $25.1 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES AND A $21.1 MILLION INCREASE IN INVENTORIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $15.0 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES WAS LARGELY DUE TO LOWER RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES DURING THE LATTER PORTION OF THE QUARTER, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE PAYMENT OF ACCRUED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN INVENTORIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE REDUCTION IN SHIPMENTS AND HIGHER UNIT COSTS DURING THE QUARTER. THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE USUAL SEASONAL DOWNTURN IN SALES NEAR THE END OF THE QUARTER COMPOUNDED BY THE ADVERSE WEATHER.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED $14.8 MILLION OF CASH DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 PRIMARILY FROM NET EARNINGS ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS TOGETHER WITH A DECREASE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL. NET WORKING CAPITAL PROVIDED $4.6 MILLION OF CASH DUE TO A $10.9 MILLION DECREASE IN INVENTORIES AND A $0.5 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $6.8 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES. THE DECREASE IN INVENTORIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES DURING THE QUARTER. THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS LARGELY RELATED TO THE USUAL SEASONAL DOWNTURN IN SALES NEAR THE END OF THE QUARTER. THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO LOWER RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES DURING THE QUARTER TOGETHER WITH THE PAYMENT OF ACCRUED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR.  18  WE MAY ELECT TO ADJUST OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS THERE ARE CHANGES IN OUR CONSTRUCTION END-MARKETS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS. WHILE A DOWNTURN IN THE LEVEL OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY ADVERSELY AFFECTS SALES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IT GENERALLY REDUCES OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INVESTING ACTIVITIES USED $5.7 MILLION OF CASH DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO $9.5 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF A BUSINESS IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND A DECREASE IN THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES IN THE CURRENT QUARTER. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCREASED SLIGHTLY TO $6.2 MILLION FROM $6.1 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER AND ARE EXPECTED TO TOTAL UP TO $22.0 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2019 PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON COST AND PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES IN ADDITION TO RECURRING MAINTENANCE.  OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES ARE LARGELY DISCRETIONARY, PROVIDING US WITH THE ABILITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL OUTLAYS SHOULD BUSINESS CONDITIONS WARRANT THAT SUCH ACTIONS BE TAKEN.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FINANCING ACTIVITIES DID NOT PROVIDE OR USE ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CASH DURING THE CURRENT OR PRIOR YEAR QUARTERS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE DECLARED A REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $576,000, OR $0.03 PER SHARE, WHICH WAS PAID IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WE DECLARED A SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND TOTALING $19.0 MILLION, OR $1.00 PER SHARE, AND A REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $571,000, OR $0.03 PER SHARE, WHICH WERE PAID IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  CASH MANAGEMENT  OUR CASH IS PRINCIPALLY CONCENTRATED AT ONE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, WHICH AT TIMES EXCEEDS FEDERALLY INSURED LIMITS. WE INVEST EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES THAT BEAR MINIMAL RISK.  CREDIT FACILITY  WE HAVE A $100.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cCREDIT FACILITY\u201d) MATURING MAY 13, 2020 THAT IS USED TO SUPPLEMENT OUR OPERATING CASH FLOW AND FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE, GENERAL CORPORATE AND GROWTH REQUIREMENTS. ADVANCES UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY ARE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENT AMOUNT (CURRENTLY $100.0 MILLION) OR A BORROWING BASE AMOUNT THAT IS CALCULATED BASED UPON A PERCENTAGE OF ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018, NO BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING ON THE CREDIT FACILITY, $98.2 MILLION OF BORROWING CAPACITY WAS AVAILABLE AND OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT TOTALED $1.8 MILLION (SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).  WE BELIEVE THAT, IN THE ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT UNANTICIPATED CASH DEMANDS, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, NET CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND THE BORROWING AVAILABILITY PROVIDED UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR EXPECTED REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, IF ANY. WE EXPECT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AS REQUIRED. HOWEVER, SHOULD WE EXPERIENCE FUTURE REDUCTIONS IN OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS DUE TO WEAKENING CONDITIONS IN OUR CONSTRUCTION END-MARKETS AND REDUCED DEMAND FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MAY NEED TO CURTAIL CAPITAL AND OPERATING EXPENDITURES, DELAY OR RESTRICT SHARE REPURCHASES, CEASE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND/OR REALIGN OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  SHOULD WE DETERMINE, AT ANY TIME, THAT WE REQUIRED ADDITIONAL SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY, WE WOULD EVALUATE THE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING THAT WOULD BE POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH FUNDING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH FINANCING, IF PURSUED, WOULD BE OBTAINED, OR IF OBTAINED, WOULD BE ADEQUATE OR ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR STRONG BALANCE SHEET, FLEXIBLE CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND BORROWING CAPACITY AVAILABLE TO US UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY POSITION US TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, INCLUDING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  SEASONALITY AND CYCLICALITY  DEMAND IN OUR MARKETS IS BOTH SEASONAL AND CYCLICAL, DRIVEN BY THE LEVEL OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, BUT CAN ALSO BE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE INVENTORY POSITIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. FROM A SEASONAL STANDPOINT, SHIPMENTS TYPICALLY REACH THEIR HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE YEAR WHEN WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE THE MOST CONDUCIVE TO CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. AS A RESULT, ASSUMING NORMAL SEASONAL WEATHER PATTERNS, SHIPMENTS AND PROFITABILITY ARE USUALLY HIGHER IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND LOWER IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS. FROM A CYCLICAL STANDPOINT, CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY AND DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS GENERALLY CORRELATED WITH GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF NONRESIDENTIAL AND RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION FOR EXTENDED PERIODS.  19  IMPACT OF INFLATION  WE ARE SUBJECT TO INFLATIONARY RISKS ARISING FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET PRICES FOR OUR PRIMARY RAW MATERIAL, HOT-ROLLED CARBON STEEL WIRE ROD, AND, TO A MUCH LESSER EXTENT, FREIGHT, ENERGY AND OTHER CONSUMABLES THAT ARE USED IN OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. WE HAVE GENERALLY BEEN ABLE TO ADJUST OUR SELLING PRICES TO PASS THROUGH INCREASES IN THESE COSTS OR OFFSET THEM THROUGH VARIOUS COST REDUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES. HOWEVER, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE OUR SELLING PRICES DEPENDS ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS, AND THERE MAY BE PERIODS DURING WHICH WE ARE UNABLE TO FULLY RECOVER INCREASES IN OUR COSTS. INFLATION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR SALES OR EARNINGS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS, ARRANGEMENTS, OBLIGATIONS (INCLUDING CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS), OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR OTHER PERSONS, AS DESCRIBED BY ITEM 303(A)(4) OF REGULATION S-K OF THE SEC, THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL CURRENT OR FUTURE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CAPITAL RESOURCES OR SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF REVENUES OR EXPENSES.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS AS DISCLOSED IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT OTHER THAN THOSE WHICH OCCUR IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. FOR INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION. THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES THE APPLICATION OF THESE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN ADDITION TO CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BASED ON CURRENT AVAILABLE INFORMATION, ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES, HISTORICAL RESULTS AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. PLEASE REFER TO \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d INCLUDED IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2018, THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN THE NATURE OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR THE APPLICATION OF THOSE POLICIES FROM THOSE REPORTED IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT OTHER THAN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2014-09 \u201cREVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\u201d.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  REFER TO NOTE 2 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT FOR RECENTLY ADOPTED AND ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS INCLUDING THE EXPECTED DATES OF ADOPTION AND ESTIMATED EFFECTS, IF ANY, ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OUTLOOK  LOOKING AHEAD TO THE REMAINDER OF 2019, WE EXPECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS WILL BE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR CONSTRUCTION END-MARKETS AND THE WEATHER-RELATED DEFERRAL OF BUSINESS FROM THE FIRST QUARTER. THE LEADING INDICATORS AND INDUSTRY FORECASTS FOR NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION REMAIN POSITIVE. THE INFRASTRUCTURE-RELATED PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS SHOULD BENEFIT FROM INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH THE FAST ACT AND SUPPLEMENTARY MEASURES TOGETHER WITH HIGHER STATE AND LOCAL SPENDING IN MANY OF OUR MARKETS SUPPORTED BY VARIOUS INITIATIVES SUCH AS FUEL TAX INCREASES, BOND ISSUANCES AND OTHER BALLOT MEASURES.  WE EXPECT BUSINESS CONDITIONS WILL REMAIN CHALLENGING, HOWEVER, IN VIEW OF THE ESCALATION IN OUR RAW MATERIAL COSTS RESULTING FROM THE SECTION 232 TARIFFS ON IMPORTED STEEL AND THE DUTIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED AGAINST CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT TRADE CASES INITIATED BY DOMESTIC WIRE ROD PRODUCERS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE OPERATIONAL FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR BUSINESS: CLOSELY MANAGING AND CONTROLLING OUR EXPENSES; ALIGNING OUR PRODUCTION SCHEDULES WITH DEMAND IN A PROACTIVE MANNER AS THERE ARE CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS TO MINIMIZE OUR CASH OPERATING COSTS; AND PURSUING FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ALL OF OUR MANUFACTURING, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO EXPECT GRADUALLY INCREASING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS WE HAVE MADE IN OUR FACILITIES IN THE FORM OF REDUCED OPERATING COSTS AND ADDITIONAL CAPACITY TO SUPPORT FUTURE GROWTH (SEE \u201cCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d). IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE FURTHER ACQUISITIONS IN OUR EXISTING BUSINESSES THAT EXPAND OUR PENETRATION OF MARKETS WE CURRENTLY SERVE OR EXPAND OUR FOOTPRINT.  20", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "INSTEEL INDUSTRIES INC", "CIK": 764401, "Date": "2019-01-17T00:00:00", "Ticker": "IIIN", "Name": "Insteel Industries Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 3310.0, "Business": "NC", "Incorporated": "NC", "IRS": 560674867.0, "key": "20190117IIIN", "labelr1": 0.4589261128958303, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": -3.3348560986751963, "labelr4": -3.9224952741020878, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5410699000000001, "prof1": 0.45893008, "return1&2": 0.9954107388710416, "return1&2&3": 1.0286062546031505, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0689532863290776, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 0.9954107388710416, "return3": 1.033348560986752, "return4": 1.0392249527410211, "1_day_return": 0.458926112895841, "cumulative_return1": 1.0610317551305772, "cumulative_return1&2": 1.1013621210009223, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.7014659287656149, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.7339002497465643, "indexx": 24, "returnpred": -0.4589261128958303, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9954107388710417, "cumreturn1b": 0.9757893192380251, "cumreturn1c": 0.9226050806476105, "cumreturndow": 1.0910253637784841, "cumreturnsp500": 1.089046515611693}, {"Unnamed: 0": 25, "level_0": 25, "index": 64028, "text": "ITEM 2.

ANNUAL LOSSES OVER THIS TIME ARE  DUE TO A COMBINATION OF DECREASING REVENUES ACROSS CERTAIN DIVISIONS WITHOUT A COMMENSURATE REDUCTION OF EXPENSES. THE COMPANY\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL AND LIQUID ASSET POSITION ARE PRESENTED BELOW (IN THOUSANDS) AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND  FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  NOVEMBER 30,  2018  FEBRUARY 28,  2018  WORKING CAPITAL  $3,680  $2,762  LIQUID ASSETS  $34  $261  MANAGEMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED A PLAN TO IMPROVE THE LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN FULFILLING A  PLAN TO INCREASE REVENUES AT ALL THE DIVISIONS, EACH STRUCTURED TO THE PARTICULAR DIVISION WHICH HAS RESULTED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE GROWTH IN REVENUES. THE COMPANY HAS REDUCED OTHER EXPENSES AT THE DIVISIONS, AS WELL AS AT THE CORPORATE LOCATION  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  VIDEO DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT FURTHER DECREASES CAN BE ACHIEVED. THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED THE MERGER OF THE TWO FLORIDA BUSINESSES INTO ONE FACILITY AND THE RELOCATION OF LEXEL IMAGING INTO A NEW  FACILITY. THESE CHANGES ARE PROJECTED TO REALIZE ANNUAL SAVINGS THROUGH REDUCED EXPENSES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO EXPLORE OPTIONS TO MONETIZE CERTAIN LONG-TERM ASSETS OF THE BUSINESS. IF ADDITIONAL AND MORE PERMANENT CAPITAL IS REQUIRED TO FUND THE  OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE CAPITAL ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY, IF AT ALL.  THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SUCCESS OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLANS TO IMPROVE REVENUES, THE  OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS, THE PROCUREMENT OF SUITABLE FINANCING, OR A COMBINATION OF THESE. THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE POTENTIAL SUCCESS OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLAN CREATE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY  TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  INVENTORY MANAGEMENT  \u2013 THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS UNITS UTILIZE DIFFERENT INVENTORY  COMPONENTS THAN THE DIVISIONS HAD IN THE PAST. THE COMPANY HAS A MONTHLY RESERVE AT EACH OF ITS DIVISIONS TO OFFSET ANY OBSOLESCENCE ALTHOUGH MOST PURCHASES ARE FOR CURRENT ORDERS, WHICH SHOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF OBSOLESCENCE IN THE FUTURE. THE  COMPANY STILL HAS CRT INVENTORY IN STOCK AND COMPONENT PARTS FOR LEGACY PRODUCTS, ALTHOUGH IT BELIEVES THE INVENTORY WILL BE SOLD IN THE FUTURE, WILL CONTINUE TO RESERVE FOR ANY ADDITIONAL OBSOLESCENCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ITS INVENTORY RESERVES AT  NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018 ARE ADEQUATE.

THE COMPANY\u2019S AYON CYBER SECURITY (ACS) DIVISION IS UP 103.8% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS LAST YEAR. ACS BUSINESS  HAS BEEN STEADILY GROWING OVER THE PAST YEAR AND THEIR BACKLOG WAS $1.3 MILLION AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2018, ACS WAS UP 378.9% WITH STEADY SHIPMENTS TO ITS TWO LARGEST CUSTOMERS. THE DISPLAY  SYSTEMS DIVISION WAS UP BY 81.6% AND 61.1% FOR THE NINE MONTHS AND THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIODS LAST YEAR. THE DIVISION HAD STRONG SALES WITH THEIR TOP CUSTOMER, LOCKHEED MARTIN AND WITH A LARGE  GOVERNMENT CONTRACT THIS YEAR. THEY ARE WORKING ON OTHER PROJECTS WITH LOCKHEED MARTIN AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO WELL WITH THIS ACCOUNT. THE DATA DISPLAY DIVISION SHOWED A DECREASE OF 51.4% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 DUE TO  DECREASES THROUGHOUT THEIR CUSTOMER BASE, THE COMPLETION OF A LARGE LONG TERM ORDER WITH A FOREIGN CUSTOMER BY THE LEXEL DIVISION, AND THE SALE OF CERTAIN ASSETS OF THE LEXEL DIVISION. THE LEXEL DIVISION WILL EXPECT LESS REVENUES GOING FORWARD AS  CERTAIN ASSETS AND BUSINESS WERE SOLD IN JUNE, 2017 AND THE DIVISION IS ALSO UNCERTAIN OF ORDERS FROM ONE OF THEIR LARGE CUSTOMERS. THEY HAVE RECEIVED SOME LARGE ORDERS FROM FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WHICH SHOULD HELP WITH THEIR SALES FOR THE REMAINDER OF  THE FISCAL YEAR. THIS DIVISION DID HAVE A 129.8% INCREASE FOR THE COMPARABLE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AS BUSINESS DID INCREASE AS LEXEL\u2019S PRODUCTION BEGAN TO STABILIZE AFTER THE PLANT MOVE FROM LAST YEAR. AYON VISUAL  SOLUTION\u2019S (AVS) SALES DECREASED BY 78.2% AND 32.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS AND THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018. THIS DIVISION\u2019S SALES ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LARGE CONTRACTS. IT HAD NONE IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  2018 AND HAD COMPETED ONE IN THE FIRST QUARTER LAST YEAR. THE DIVISION DID RECEIVE A LARGE CONTRACT OF $1.3 MILLION WHICH WILL SHIP IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. THE DIVISION\u2019S PRIMARY SUPPLIER WAS SOLD TO A COMPETITOR OF THE COMPANY, SO THE  FUTURE OF THIS DIVISION IS UNCERTAIN. THE OTHER INCREASE IN SALES WAS FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S NEW KEYBOARD DIVISION, WHICH POSTED SALES OF $1.1 MILLION AND $0.4 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS AND THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018  RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY ACQUIRED THIS COMPANY IN OCTOBER OF 2017. THIS DIVISION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT THIS LEVEL OF SALES EACH QUARTER.  GROSS  MARGINS  CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGINS INCREASED BOTH AS A PERCENTAGE TO SALES (25.8% TO 10.7%) AND ACTUAL DOLLARS ($2,971 THOUSAND  TO $931 THOUSAND) FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017. GROSS MARGINS INCREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017, BOTH AS A PERCENTAGE TO SALES (26.3% TO (8.7)%) AND ACTUAL DOLLARS, ($1,096 THOUSAND TO $(144) THOUSAND).  THE TWO FLORIDA DIVISIONS PERFORMED WELL AS THE MOVE TO ONE FACILITY IS SHOWING RESULTS. BOTH DIVISIONS SHOWED LARGE INCREASES IN BOTH THEIR  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE TO SALES AND IN ACTUAL DOLLARS. AYON CYBER SECURITY (ACS) GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS 48.1% COMPARED TO 28.0% AND THE GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS WERE $2,068 THOUSAND COMPARED TO $591 THOUSAND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, ACS GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS 45.0% COMPARED TO 41.5% AND GROSS MARGIN  DOLLARS WERE $848 THOUSAND COMPARED TO $163 THOUSAND. VDC DISPLAY SYSTEMS (VDCDS) GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS 10.9% COMPARED 3.2% AND THE GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS WERE $485 THOUSAND COMPARED TO $78 THOUSAND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, VDCDS GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS 5.7% COMPARED TO 2.3%. GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS  WERE $74 THOUSAND COMPARED TO $19 THOUSAND. THE NEW KEYBOARD DIVISION, UNICOMP, HAD $467 THOUSAND OF GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS OR 43.7% TO SALES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND $155 THOUSAND OF GROSS MARGIN  DOLLARS OR 40.1% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  VIDEO DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  THE OTHER TWO DIVISIONS HAD AN EROSION OF MARGINS DUE TO POOR SALES AS DISCUSSED IN THE SALES  SECTION ABOVE. THE DATA DISPLAY DIVISION HAD A NEGATIVE $105 THOUSAND IN GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS AND THE AYON VISUAL SOLUTION (AVS) DIVISION HAD $57 THOUSAND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018. THE DATA DIVISION IS EXPECTED TO  DO BETTER IN THE NEXT QUARTER AS THE LEXEL FACILITY IS EXPECTED TO DO BETTER AS A RESULT OF THE FOREIGN ORDERS DISCUSSED IN THE SALES SECTION ABOVE. AVS DIVISION HAS BEEN ABSORBED IN THE VDCDS DIVISION AND HAS RECEIVED THE LARGE ORDER FOR A VIDEO  WALL FOR A MAJOR ELECTRICAL COMPANY. IT IS SCHEDULED TO BE INSTALLED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S NEXT FISCAL YEAR.  OPERATING EXPENSES  OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED BY 1.9% OR $61 THOUSAND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2017. THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO LEGAL EXPENSES OF $133 THOUSAND ASSOCIATED WITH THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS WITH LEXEL IMAGING AND THE LEGAL EXPENSES FOR THE SALE OF CERTAIN ASSETS OF LEXEL IMAGING IN THE FIRST QUARTER LAST YEAR  OFFSET BY HIGHER ENGINEERING SALARIES AT AYON CYBER SECURITY AND ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES OF $382 THOUSAND AT UNICOMP, THE ACQUIRED KEYBOARD DIVISION. OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED BY 4.1% OR $46 THOUSAND FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE COSTS WHILE INCREASING REVENUES WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE CONSOLIDATION OF ITS TWO FLORIDA BUSINESSES TO ONE LOCATION,  THE MOVE OF LEXEL IMAGING TO A MUCH LOWER COST FACILITY AND FURTHER CONSOLIDATION OF OPERATIONS BY MERGING THE TWO TUCKER BUSINESS UNITS, ONE INTO LEXEL IMAGING AND THE OTHER INTO THE FLORIDA OPERATIONS IN THE UPCOMING QUARTER.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $18 THOUSAND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND $4 THOUSAND FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND $12 THOUSAND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2017 AND $4 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING  NOVEMBER 30, 2017. THE INTEREST EXPENSE IS RELATED TO THE BALANCE OWED ON A BUILDING THE COMPANY OWNS IN PENNSYLVANIA, THE LINE OF CREDIT AT THE COMPANY\u2019S BANK AND THE INTEREST ON THE MARGIN BALANCE IN THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT  ACCOUNT, WHICH IS A 3.75% RATE.  OTHER INCOME/ EXPENSE  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE COMPANY HAD $129 THOUSAND IN ROYALTY INCOME, $128 THOUSAND IN RENTAL INCOME,  $33 THOUSAND ON THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF EQUIPMENT AND $29 THOUSAND IN OTHER, AND $52 IN INVESTMENT GAINS INCLUDING DIVIDENDS. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 THE COMPANY HAD $40 THOUSAND IN RENTAL INCOME,  $16 THOUSAND IN ROYALTY INCOME, $18 THOUSAND IN INVESTMENT LOSSES AND $14 THOUSAND IN OTHER. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017, THE COMPANY EARNED $294 THOUSAND ON THE SALE OF CERTAIN ASSETS TO A COMPETITOR,  $208 THOUSAND ON ROYALTIES, $126 THOUSAND IN RENTAL INCOME AND ANOTHER NET OF $29 THOUSAND ON OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017 THE COMPANY HAD OTHER INCOME OF $59 THOUSAND DOLLARS,  PRIMARILY $55 IN RENTAL INCOME.  INCOME TAXES  DUE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S OVERALL AND HISTORICAL NET LOSS POSITION, NO INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS REPORTED FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDING  NOVEMBER 30, 2018 NOR FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. DUE TO CONTINUED LOSSES REPORTED BY THE COMPANY, A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS ALLOCATED TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET CREATED BY THESE LOSSES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE  ACCOMPANYING INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE PREPARED ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS, WHICH CONTEMPLATES THE REALIZATION OF ASSETS AND THE SATISFACTION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. EVEN THOUGH THE COMPANY  REPORTED A SMALL PROFIT FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND A SLIGHT INCREASE IN WORKING  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  VIDEO DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  CAPITAL FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD, THE COMPANY HAS SUSTAINED LOSSES FOR EACH OF THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS AND HAS SEEN OVERALL A DECLINE IN WORKING CAPITAL AND LIQUID ASSETS DURING THIS THREE  YEAR PERIOD. ANNUAL LOSSES OVER THIS TIME ARE DUE TO A COMBINATION OF DECREASING REVENUES ACROSS CERTAIN DIVISIONS WITHOUT A COMMENSURATE REDUCTION OF EXPENSES. THE COMPANY\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL AND LIQUID ASSET POSITION ARE PRESENTED BELOW (IN  THOUSANDS) AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  NOVEMBER 30,  2018  FEBRUARY 28,  2018  WORKING CAPITAL  $3,680  $2,762  LIQUID ASSETS  $34  $261  MANAGEMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED A PLAN TO IMPROVE THE LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN FULFILLING A  PLAN TO INCREASE REVENUES AT ALL THE DIVISIONS, EACH STRUCTURED TO THE PARTICULAR DIVISION WHICH HAS RESULTED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE GROWTH IN REVENUES. THE COMPANY HAS REDUCED OTHER EXPENSES AT THE DIVISIONS, AS WELL AS AT THE CORPORATE LOCATION  WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT FURTHER DECREASES CAN BE ACHIEVED. THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED THE MERGER OF THE TWO FLORIDA BUSINESSES INTO ONE FACILITY AND THE RELOCATION OF LEXEL IMAGING INTO A NEW FACILITY. THESE CHANGES ARE PROJECTED TO REALIZE ANNUAL  SAVINGS THROUGH REDUCED EXPENSES. MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO EXPLORE OPTIONS TO MONETIZE CERTAIN LONG-TERM ASSETS OF THE BUSINESS. IF ADDITIONAL AND MORE PERMANENT CAPITAL IS REQUIRED TO FUND THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN  THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE CAPITAL ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY, IF AT ALL.  THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE  AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SUCCESS OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLANS TO IMPROVE REVENUES, THE OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS, THE PROCUREMENT OF SUITABLE FINANCING, OR A COMBINATION OF THESE. THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE  POTENTIAL SUCCESS OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLAN CREATE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  CASH USED BY OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 WAS $0.9 MILLION. THE NET PROFIT FROM OPERATIONS WAS  $0.1 MILLION AND ADJUSTMENTS TO RECONCILE NET PROFIT TO NET CASH WERE $0.4 MILLION INCLUDING INVENTORY RESERVES, DEPRECIATION AND  NON-CASH  CHARGES FOR SHARE BASED COMPENSATION. CHANGES IN WORKING  CAPITAL USED $1.4 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $1.3 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER DEPOSITS OF $0.1 MILLION, OFFSET BY COST, ESTIMATED EARNINGS, AND BILLINGS ON UNCOMPLETED CONTRACTS OF  $0.4 MILLION, AND OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN INVENTORIES OF $0.5 MILLION. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017 WAS $0.5 MILLION. THE NET LOSS FROM OPERATIONS WAS $1.7 MILLION AND ADJUSTMENTS  TO RECONCILE NET LOSS TO NET CASH WERE $0.3 MILLION INCLUDING INVENTORY RESERVES, DEPRECIATION AND  NON-CASH  CHARGES FOR SHARE BASED COMPENSATION. CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL PROVIDED $1.8 MILLION,  PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $2.1 MILLION, SMALLER ADJUSTMENTS TOTALING $0.4 MILLION, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $0.4 MILLION, A DECREASE IN CUSTOMER DEPOSITS OF $0.3 MILLION.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED $0.3 MILLION. $1.0 MILLION WAS USED FOR THE PURCHASE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES OFFSET BY  $1.3 MILLION FOR THE SALE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.

ON JANUARY 20, 2014, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY APPROVED A  ONE-TIME  CONTINUATION OF THE STOCK REPURCHASE  PROGRAM, AND AUTHORIZED THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE UP TO 1,500,000 ADDITIONAL SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK ON THE OPEN MARKET, DEPENDING ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE SHARES. THERE IS NO MINIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES REQUIRED TO BE REPURCHASED  UNDER THE PROGRAM.

UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AN ADDITIONAL 490,186 SHARES REMAIN AUTHORIZED TO BE  REPURCHASED BY THE COMPANY AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERIM CONDENSED  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THESE PRINCIPLES REQUIRE THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT AMOUNTS REPORTED AND DISCLOSED IN  THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES. THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT MAY INVOLVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES, AND COMPLEXITY INCLUDE RESERVES ON INVENTORIES, REVENUE RECOGNITION, AND THE SUFFICIENCY OF  THE VALUATION RESERVE RELATED TO DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE COMPANY USES THE FOLLOWING METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS IN DETERMINING ITS ESTIMATES.  RESERVES ON  INVENTORIES  RESERVES ON INVENTORIES RESULT IN A CHARGE TO OPERATIONS WHEN THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE DECLINES BELOW COST.  MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT IN INVENTORIES FOR DECLINES IN VALUE AND ESTABLISHES RESERVES WHEN IT IS APPARENT THAT THE EXPECTED NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE INVENTORY FALLS BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS  INVENTORY LEVELS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. SUCH REVIEWS INCLUDE OBSERVATIONS OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TRENDS OF THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS, NEW PRODUCTS BEING MARKETED, AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES RELATIVE TO THE PRODUCT CAPABILITIES OF THE  COMPANY\u2019S EXISTING INVENTORIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ITS INVENTORY RESERVES AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018 ARE ADEQUATE.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  EFFECTIVE  MARCH 1, 2018 WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d)  NO. 2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS  WITH CUSTOMERS  AND THE ADDITIONAL RELATED ASUS (ASC \u201c606\u201d), WHICH  REPLACES EXISTING REVENUE GUIDANCE AND OUTLINES A SINGLE SET OF COMPREHENSIVE PRINCIPLES FOR RECOGNIZING REVENUE UNDER GAAP. THESE STANDARDS PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON RECOGNIZING REVENUE, INCLUDING A FIVE-STEP METHOD TO DETERMINE WHEN REVENUE RECOGNITION  IS APPROPRIATE. ASC 606 PROVIDES THAT REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES IS TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS AT AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE  GOODS OR SERVICES. WE GENERALLY SATISFY PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS UPON DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TIME IN WHICH THE CUSTOMER OBTAINS CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE. IN CERTAIN CASES, WE RECOGNIZE  REVENUE USING THE  PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION  METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. BASED ON THE NATURE OF PRODUCTS PROVIDED OR SERVICES PERFORMED, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS COSTS ARE  INCURRED (THE PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION COST TO COST METHOD). WE ELECTED THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD UPON ADOPTION WITH NO IMPACT TO THE OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS OR REVENUE REPORTED.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  VIDEO DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES  OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS  REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. DISCLOSURE IS REQUIRED WHEN THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ULTIMATE LOSS WILL EXCEED THE RECORDED PROVISION. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ARE OFTEN RESOLVED OVER LONG TIME PERIODS. ESTIMATING PROBABLE LOSSES REQUIRES  ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT OFTEN DEPEND ON JUDGMENTS ABOUT POTENTIAL ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES.  INCOME TAXES  DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED TO REFLECT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES IN FUTURE YEARS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND  LIABILITIES AND THEIR FINANCIAL REPORTING AMOUNTS BASED ON ENACTED TAX LAWS AND STATUTORY TAX RATES APPLICABLE TO THE PERIODS IN WHICH THE DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO AFFECT TAXABLE INCOME. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN NECESSARY TO  REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED. AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018 THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $5.8 MILLION FOR BOTH PERIODS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT AND  NON-CURRENT  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS UNDER THE PROVISIONS  OF ASC 740, WHICH CONTAINS A  TWO-STEP  APPROACH TO RECOGNIZING AND MEASURING UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. THE FIRST STEP IS TO EVALUATE THE TAX POSITION FOR RECOGNITION BY DETERMINING IF THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE  EVIDENCE INDICATES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON AUDIT, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, IF ANY. THE SECOND STEP IS TO MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT, WHICH IS MORE  THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS WHEN EVALUATING AND ESTIMATING THE COMPANY\u2019S TAX POSITIONS AND TAX BENEFITS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE PERIODIC ADJUSTMENTS. AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018, THE  COMPANY DID NOT RECORD ANY LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN MAY, 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ASU  2014-09,  WHICH CREATED A SINGLE, COMPREHENSIVE REVENUE RECOGNITION  MODEL FOR RECOGNIZING REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017 AND MAY BE ADOPTED EITHER RETROSPECTIVELY OR ON A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE BASIS.  ASU  2014-09  DID NOT RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE JUDGEMENT OR TIMING ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU  2014-09  ON MARCH 1, 2018. SEE NOTE 1 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED  ASU  2016-02,  \u201cLEASES\u201d. ASU  2016-02  INCREASES TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY AMONG ORGANIZATIONS BY REQUIRING ENTITIES TO RECOGNIZE LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE  LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND DISCLOSE KEY INFORMATION ABOUT THE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THAT REPORTING PERIOD. EARLY  ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS GUIDANCE ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DURING THE SECOND  HALF OF FISCAL 2016, THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS WERE DISRUPTED WHEN THE COMPANY WAS FORCED TO MOVE FROM ITS FACILITIES IN  REDONDO BEACH, CALIFORNIA TO A SMALLER FACILITY IN STANTON, CALIFORNIA. OPERATIONS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2016 WERE  SPORADIC. DURING FISCAL 2017 AND FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY SUSPENDED ITS ENGINEERING, MANUFACTURING, SALES, AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES  TO FOCUS ON RENEGOTIATING NUMEROUS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS.  IN  FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY SUCCESSFULLY ELIMINATED APPROXIMATELY 68% OF ITS TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS.  SPECIFICALLY,  IN FISCAL 2018, OUR SECURED CREDITORS CONVERTED APPROXIMATELY $5.73 MILLION OF SECURED DEBT INTO APPROXIMATELY 4.1 MILLION SHARES  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK. THE CONVERTED DEBT REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 80% OF THE TOTAL SECURED DEBT OF THE COMPANY.  THE BALANCE OF THE SECURED DEBT (THE REMAINING APPROXIMATE 20%), IS TO BE PAID TO THE SECURED CREDITORS IN CASH IF THE COMPANY  RAISES AT LEAST $4.0 MILLION IN PROCEEDS THROUGH NEW EQUITY OFFERINGS. ADDITIONALLY, IN FISCAL 2018, APPROXIMATELY 12.77 MILLION  OF UNSECURED DEBT WAS CONVERTED INTO APPROXIMATELY 9.3 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK AND APPROXIMATELY $12.3  MILLION OF UNSECURED DEBT WAS FORGIVEN. IN TOTAL, DURING FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY THEREFORE ELIMINATED A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY  $30.23 MILLION OF DEBT.  AS  OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, ROBERT KOPPLE, THE COMPANY\u2019S FORMER VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, IS THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT UNSECURED  NOTE HOLDER THAT HAS NOT AGREED TO RESTRUCTURE HIS DEBT. MR. KOPPLE CLAIMS THAT HE AND HIS AFFILIATES ARE OWED APPROXIMATELY $5.35  MILLION ON TERMS SIGNIFICANTLY PREFERABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY-SITUATED UNSECURED CREDITORS. THE COMPANY DISPUTES MR. KOPPLE\u2019S  CLAIMS. SEE \u201cITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\u201d INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2018 FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE DISPUTE WITH MR. KOPPLE REGARDING THESE TRANSACTIONS. MR. KOPPLE HAS NOT ACCEPTED  THE COMPANY\u2019S NUMEROUS OFFERS TO RESTRUCTURE THIS DEBT.  ON  FEBRUARY 14, 2018, THE COMPANY EFFECTUATED A ONE-FOR-SEVEN REVERSE STOCK SPLIT.  THE  COMPANY IS PLANNING TO RESTART OPERATIONS WITH A NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM AND IS PRESENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING CANDIDATES  FOR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY HAS A CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT FOR $1.25 MILLION  OF ORDERS FOR THE AURAGEN  \u00ae  PRODUCT TO FILL DURING THE NEXT EIGHT MONTHS AND ANTICIPATES THAT IT MAY RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT  ADDITIONAL ORDERS ONCE THE COMPANY IS BACK IN OPERATION.  OUR  BUSINESS IS BASED ON THE EXPLOITATION OF OUR PATENTED MOBILE POWER SOLUTION KNOWN AS THE AURAGEN FOR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL  APPLICATIONS AND THE VIPER FOR MILITARY APPLICATIONS. OUR BUSINESS MODEL CONSISTS OF THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS; (I) SALES AND MARKETING,  (II) ENGINEERING, AND (III) CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SUPPORT.  (I)  OUR SALES AND MARKETING APPROACH IS COMPOSED OF DIRECT SALES IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE USE OF AGENTS, DISTRIBUTORS AND JOINT VENTURES  FOR SALES INTERNATIONALLY. IN NORTH AMERICA, OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS IN (A) TRANSPORT REFRIGERATION, AND (B) U.S. MILITARY APPLICATIONS.  (II)  THE SECOND COMPONENT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS FOCUSED ON THE ENGINEERING SUPPORT FOR THE SALES ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE  ENGINEERING SUPPORT CONSISTS OF THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW FEATURES FOR OUR AURAGEN  \u00ae  SOLUTION SUCH AS HIGHER POWER,  DIFFERENT VOLTAGES, THREE PHASE OPTIONS, SHORE POWER SYSTEMS, HIGHER CURRENT SOLUTIONS AS WELL AS INTERFACE KITS FOR DIFFERENT  PLATFORMS. AFTER SUSPENDING ENGINEERING, MANUFACTURING, SALES, AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES TO FOCUS ON RENEGOTIATING NUMEROUS FINANCIAL  OBLIGATIONS IN FISCAL 2017 AND 2018, WE EXPECT MODEST ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES BUDGETED AT APPROXIMATELY $750,000 DURING THE FISCAL  2019 YEAR.  (III)  THE THIRD COMPONENT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS CUSTOMER SERVICE. IN FISCAL 2019, WE EXPECT TO REHIRE SEVERAL PREVIOUSLY TRAINED  FIELD ENGINEERS TO SUPPORT OUR PRODUCT IN NORTH AMERICA. IN ADDITION, WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR CHINESE JOINT VENTURE PARTNER  TO TRAIN THEIR STAFF TO SUPPORT OUR PRODUCTS OVERSEAS.  13  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION  OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND DISCLOSURES ON THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ON AN ON-GOING  BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION. WE USE AUTHORITATIVE PRONOUNCEMENTS,  HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS AS THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  REVENUE  RECOGNITION  WE  ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE JUDGMENTS BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND FUTURE EXPECTATIONS, AS TO THE RELIABILITY OF SHIPMENTS MADE  TO OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE JUDGMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE PROPRIETY OF THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE BASED ON STAFF ACCOUNTING  BULLETIN (\u201cSAB\u201d) NO. 101, \u201cREVENUE RECOGNITION,\u201d AND RELATED GUIDANCE. BECAUSE SALES ARE CURRENTLY IN  LIMITED VOLUME AND MANY SALES ARE FOR EVALUATIVE PURPOSES, WE HAVE NOT BOOKED A GENERAL RESERVE FOR RETURNS. WE WILL CONSIDER  AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESERVE FOR PRODUCT RETURNS WHEN OUR SALES INCREASE TO COMMERCIAL LEVELS.  INVENTORY  VALUATION AND CLASSIFICATION  INVENTORIES  CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COMPONENTS AND COMPLETED UNITS FOR OUR AURAGEN  \u00ae  PRODUCT. INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE LOWER  OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET. PROVISION IS MADE FOR ESTIMATED AMOUNTS OF CURRENT INVENTORIES THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME  OBSOLETE DUE TO CHANGES IN THE PRODUCT ITSELF OR VEHICLE ENGINE TYPES THAT GO OUT OF PRODUCTION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT EXISTING  INVENTORIES CAN, AND WILL, BE SOLD IN THE FUTURE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO UPGRADE IT TO CURRENT MODELS AND THAT THE VALUATION  OF THE INVENTORIES ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE REALIZABLE VALUES OF THESE ASSETS. THE AURAGEN  \u00ae  PRODUCT BEING SOLD CURRENTLY  IS NOT TECHNOLOGICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN CURRENT USE. EXISTING FINISHED GOODS INVENTORIES CAN BE UPGRADED TO THE CURRENT  MODEL WITH ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF MATERIALS AND MANPOWER. WE MAKE THESE ASSESSMENTS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: I) EXISTING  ORDERS, II) AGE OF THE INVENTORY, III) HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND IV) OUR EXPECTATIONS AS TO FUTURE SALES. IF EXPECTED SALES VOLUMES  DO NOT MATERIALIZE, THERE WOULD BE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  VALUATION  OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  LONG-LIVED  ASSETS, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, AND PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS, COMPRISE A PORTION OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS.  LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THEIR CARRYING VALUES  AUGUST NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS IS MEASURED BY A COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET TO THE FUTURE  NET CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THOSE ASSETS. NET CASH FLOWS ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON EXPECTATIONS AS TO THE REALIZE-ABILITY  OF THE ASSET. FACTORS THAT COULD TRIGGER A REVIEW INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE MANNER OF AN ASSET\u2019S USE OR OUR OVERALL  STRATEGY.  SPECIFIC  ASSET CATEGORIES ARE TREATED AS FOLLOWS.  ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE: WE RECORD AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BASED ON OUR EXPECTATION OF COLLECT-ABILITY OF CURRENT AND PAST DUE ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE.  PROPERTY,  PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: WE DEPRECIATE OUR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT OVER VARIOUS USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM FIVE TO TEN YEARS. ADJUSTMENTS  ARE MADE AS WARRANTED WHEN MARKET CONDITIONS AND VALUES INDICATE THAT THE CURRENT VALUE OF AN ASSET IS LESS THAN ITS NET BOOK  VALUE.  WHEN  WE DETERMINE THAT AN ASSET IS IMPAIRED, WE MEASURE ANY SUCH IMPAIRMENT BY DISCOUNTING AN ASSET\u2019S REALIZABLE VALUE TO THE  PRESENT USING A DISCOUNT RATE APPROPRIATE TO THE PERCEIVED RISK IN REALIZING SUCH VALUE. WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT AN IMPAIRED ASSET  HAS NO FORESEEABLE REALIZABLE VALUE, WE WRITE SUCH ASSET DOWN TO ZERO.  14  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  NINE  MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017  NET  REVENUES WERE $39,274 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 (THE \u201cNINE MONTHS FY2019\u201d) COMPARED TO $0 FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017 (THE \u201cNINE MONTHS FY2018\u201d).  COST  OF GOODS WERE $110,026 IN THE NINE MONTHS FY2019 COMPARED TO $0 FOR THE NINE MONTHS FY2018.  ENGINEERING,  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED $277,043 (1,097%) TO $302,293 IN THE NINE MONTHS FY2019 FROM $25,250 IN THE NINE MONTHS  FY 2018. ALL THE EXPENSE IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD IS DUE TO THE COMPANY REDESIGNING THE ECU FOR THE AURAGEN SYSTEM.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE INCREASED $3,036,032 (173%) TO $4,789,451 IN THE NINE MONTHS FY2019 FROM $1,753,419 IN THE  NINE MONTHS FY2018. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE VALUE OF THE STOCK AND WARRANTS ISSUED IN THE AMOUNT OF $2,431,077  AND AN INCREASE IN LEGAL EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $260,000.  NET  INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE NINE MONTHS FY2019 DECREASED $1,779,730 (68%) TO $848,593 FROM $2,628,323 IN THE NINE MONTHS FY2018 AS  A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR THAT ELIMINATED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF DEBT.  OUR  NET LOSS FOR THE NINE MONTHS FY2019 INCREASED $491,423 TO $5,706,947 FROM $5,215,524 IN THE NINE MONTHS FY2018.  THREE  MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017  NET  REVENUES WERE $0 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 (THE \u201cTHIRD QUARTER FY2019\u201d) COMPARED TO $0 FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017 (THE \u201cTHIRD QUARTER FY2018\u201d).  COST  OF GOODS WERE $37,032 IN THE THIRD QUARTER FY2019 COMPARED TO $0 FOR THE THIRD QUARTER FY2018.  ENGINEERING,  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED $113,167 TO $138,417 IN THE THIRD QUARTER FY2019 FROM $25,250 IN THE THIRD QUARTER  FY 2018. ALL THE EXPENSE IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD IS DUE TO THE COMPANY REDESIGNING THE ECU FOR THE AURAGEN SYSTEM.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE DECREASED $121,287 (11%) TO $790,985 IN THE THIRD QUARTER FY2019 FROM $822,616 IN THE THIRD  QUARTER FY2018.  NET  INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE THIRD QUARTER FY2019 DECREASED $507,051 (63%) TO $295,221 FROM $802,272 IN THE THIRD QUARTER FY2018 AS  A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR THAT ELIMINATED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF DEBT.  OUR  NET LOSS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER FY2019 DECREASED $530,343 TO $1,310,445 FROM $1,661,534 IN THE THIRD QUARTER FY2018.  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE  HAD CASH OF APPROXIMATELY $21,000 AND $748,000 AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018, AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  WE HAD A WORKING  CAPITAL DEFICIT AT NOVEMBER 30, 2018, AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018 OF $20,452,425 AND $20,682,519, RESPECTIVELY. THE WORKING CAPITAL  DEFICIT INCLUDES NOTES PAYABLE AND ACCRUED INTEREST TO RELATED PARTIES OF $9,284,183 AND $8,696,665 AS OF NOVEMBER 30 AND FEBRUARY  28, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  NET  CASH USED IN OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WAS $1,902,151, A DECREASE OF $162,189 FROM THE COMPARABLE  PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WAS  $1,175,000, RESULTING FROM NET PROCEEDS FROM SUBSCRIPTIONS RECEIVABLE OF $1,225,000 PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A PAYMENT OF $50,000 ON  A NOTE PAYABLE.  15  THERE  WERE NO ACQUISITIONS OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT DURING THE NINE MONTHS FY2019 OR THE NINE MONTHS FY2018.  ACCRUED  EXPENSES AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018 INCREASED $111,863 TO $3,323,498 FROM $3,211,635 AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2018. APPROXIMATELY $2,225,000  OF ACCRUED EXPENSES IS SALARIES ACCRUED BUT UNPAID TO CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES DUE TO A LACK OF RESOURCES, AND APPROXIMATELY  $500,000 IS ACCRUED BUT UNUSED VACATION EARNED BY EMPLOYEES.  THE  COMPANY HAD A DEFICIT OF $24,435,402 IN SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2018, COMPARED TO $24,665,496 AS OF FEBRUARY  28, 2018.  SINCE  2002 SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN DERIVED FROM SALES OF THE AURAGEN  \u00ae  . THE CASH FLOW  GENERATED FROM OUR OPERATIONS TO DATE HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, AND WE CANNOT PREDICT WHEN OPERATING  CASH FLOW WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS.  IN  THE PAST, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY, WE HAVE RELIED UPON EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FINANCING, PRINCIPALLY EQUITY FINANCING AND  PRIVATE INDEBTEDNESS. WE HAVE NO BANK LINE OF CREDIT AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING TO FUND ONGOING OPERATIONS.  THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF EQUITY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH FINANCING COULD DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS,  AND SUCH DILUTION COULD BE SUBSTANTIAL. IF WE CANNOT RAISE NEEDED FUNDS, WE WOULD ALSO BE FORCED TO MAKE FURTHER SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS  IN OUR OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PLAN AND ULTIMATELY OUR  VIABILITY AS A COMPANY.  CAPITAL  TRANSACTIONS  DURING  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WE ISSUED 2,256,444 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, VALUED AT $2,280,964 TO HARRY KURTZMAN ON  BEHALF OF BETTERSEA LLC, A GREATER THAN 15% SHAREHOLDER AS PART OF THE RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT. WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL 5,108,291  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK VALUED AT $1,992,251 TO HARRY KURTZMAN ON BEHALF OF BETTERSEA LLC AS A SETTLEMENT FOR DISPUTES. DURING  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WE ISSUED 742,857 WARRANTS TO MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE WARRANTS HAVE A  TERM OF FIVE YEARS AND AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $1.40. THE COMPANY RECORDED AN EXPENSE OF $312,072 FOR THE ISSUANCE OF THESE WARRANTS.  DURING  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2017, WE ISSUED 5,000,000 (714,286 POST SPLIT) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR $1,000,000 IN CONJUNCTION  WITH OUR CHINESE JOINT VENTURE, WE ISSUED 5,116,959(730,994 POST SPLIT) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK VALUED AT $665,204 AS PART OF A  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, AND WE ISSUED 2,500,000 (357,143 POST SPLIT) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK VALUED AT $325,000 IN CONNECTION WITH  A CONSULTING AGREEMENT.  INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES  CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COMPONENTS AND COMPLETED UNITS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S AURAGEN  \u00ae  PRODUCT.  EARLY  IN OUR AURAGEN  \u00ae  PROGRAM, WE DETERMINED IT WAS MOST COST-EFFECTIVE TO OUTSOURCE PRODUCTION OF COMPONENTS AND SUBASSEMBLIES  TO VOLUME-ORIENTED MANUFACTURERS, RATHER THAN PRODUCE THESE PARTS IN HOUSE. AS A RESULT OF THIS DECISION, AND BASED ON THEN ANTICIPATED  SALES, WE PURCHASED, PRIOR TO FISCAL 2001, A SUBSTANTIAL INVENTORY OF COMPONENTS AT VOLUME PRICES. SINCE SALES DID NOT MEET SUCH  EXPECTATIONS, WE HAVE BEEN SELLING PRODUCT FROM THIS INVENTORY FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  MOST  OF OUR INVENTORY CONSISTS OF A VARIETY OF (I) METALLIC, MECHANICAL COMPONENTS, AND (II) ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS INCLUDING METALLIC  CHASSIS TO HOLD THE ASSEMBLED ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF MECHANICAL COMPONENTS ARE NOT AGED AND MOST OF THE ELECTRICAL  COMPONENTS ARE ALSO NOT AGED. THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE AGED ARE RELATED TO THE PRIME MOVER/GENERATOR INTERFACE THAT MAY NOT BE  IN DEMAND ANY LONGER.  IN  THE PAST WE HAVE OFFERED AND SHIP THREE DIFFERENT BASIC MODELS OF SYSTEMS; (I) A 5 KW BASED SYSTEM, (II) AN 8.5 KW BASED SYSTEM  AND (III) A 16 KW BASED SYSTEMS (TWO 8.5 KW SYSTEMS CONFIGURED IN TANDEM BACK-TO-BACK). EACH OF THESE SYSTEMS CAN BE CONFIGURED  WITH DIFFERENT OPTIONS SUCH AS 110 VAC ONLY, 220 VAC ONLY, 24 VDC ONLY, 12 VDC ONLY AND AC/DC COMBINATIONS OF THE SAME OR DIFFERENT  VOLTAGES. IN ADDITION, THE SYSTEM CAN BE CONFIGURED WITH SINGLE PHASE, SPLIT PHASE OR THREE-PHASE OUTPUT.  16  A  NUMBER OF THE MECHANICAL COMPONENTS ARE COMMON TO ALL THREE OF THE ABOVE CONFIGURATIONS, WHILE OTHERS ARE VERY SPECIFIC. FOR EXAMPLE,  THE STATORS AND ROTORS FOR THE 5 KW SYSTEMS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE 8.5 KW SYSTEMS, BUT THE HOUSINGS ARE THE SAME. SIMILARLY, THE  ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS CONSIST OF SOME PARTS THAT ARE GEARED FOR A SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION WHILE OTHERS ARE GENERIC AND CAN BE USED  FOR ALL OF THE CONFIGURATIONS. THE ELECTRICAL CHASSIS ARE ALSO INTERCHANGEABLE BETWEEN THE 5 KW AND 8.5 KW CONFIGURATIONS. DUE  TO THE NATURE AND MIX OF THE PRODUCT BEING SOLD, FREQUENTLY, THE 5 KW ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS ARE UPGRADED TO 8.5 KW SYSTEMS BY REPLACING  SOME COMPONENTS.  FROM  THE ABOVE DESCRIPTION ONE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THE INVENTORY CONSISTS OF NUMEROUS COMPONENTS AND SUBASSEMBLIES BUT NOT FINISHED  SYSTEMS; THEREFORE, EACH SYSTEM THAT IS SOLD AND SHIPPED TO A CUSTOMER IS BUILT FROM SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE IN INVENTORY AND  OTHERS THAT NEED TO BE PURCHASED TO BE ABLE TO CONFIGURE THE REQUIRED SYSTEM.  8.5  KW SYSTEMS REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF PRODUCT PREVIOUSLY SHIPPED. THESE SYSTEMS ARE BUILT BY USING EXISTING INVENTORY SUBASSEMBLIES  AND PARTS, INCLUDING SOME THAT CAN BE USED FOR BOTH 5 KW AND 8.5 KW SYSTEMS, AND ADDITIONAL PARTS THAT ARE PURCHASED TO PROVIDE  THE REQUIRED CONFIGURATION. TYPICALLY, SUCH SYSTEMS ARE BUILT USING APPROXIMATELY 20 TO 25 PERCENT OF EXISTING INVENTORY AND APPROXIMATELY  75% OF ADDITIONAL PARTS THAT ARE PURCHASED.  HOWEVER,  MOST OF THE SYSTEMS SOLD TO THE KOREAN MILITARY CONSIST OF 5 KW SYSTEMS. THEY HAVE BEEN PURCHASING APPROXIMATELY 100 SYSTEMS PER  YEAR AND HAVE INDICATED TO US THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. TO DATE WE HAVE SHIPPED OVER 500 SUCH  SYSTEMS (IN THIS CASE 100% OF THE ROTORS AND STATORS ARE USED FROM EXISTING INVENTORY AND OVER 50% OF THE ELECTRICAL PARTS ARE  ALSO FROM INVENTORY).  IN  ADDITION TO THE ABOVE, WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED DEMAND FOR DIFFERENT AND UNIQUE CONFIGURATIONS THAT REQUIRE THE PURCHASE OF ADDITIONAL  PARTS.", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "AURA SYSTEMS INC", "CIK": 826253, "Date": "2019-01-22T00:00:00", "Ticker": "AUSI", "Name": "Aura Systems Inc", "Exchange": "OTC", "SIC": 3690.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 954106894.0, "key": "20190122AUSI", "labelr1": 1.1884550084889656, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": -6.040268456375826, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5419148, "prof1": 0.45808524, "return1&2": 0.9881154499151104, "return1&2&3": 0.9881154499151104, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0478002757489089, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 0.9881154499151104, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0604026845637582, "1_day_return": 1.1884550084889645, "cumulative_return1": 1.458509985564991, "cumulative_return1&2": 1.7468638899051137, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.8622706734832528, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1.1079860761522065, "indexx": 28, "returnpred": -1.1884550084889656, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.1091632313927242, "cumreturn1b": 1.0823096344845544, "cumreturn1c": 0.9182302003178808, "cumreturndow": 1.0779487911387033, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0832839661896683}, {"Unnamed: 0": 29, "level_0": 29, "index": 207, "text": "ITEM 2.

UNDERLYING SALES  DECREASED 2%  AS UNFAVORABLE VOLUMES OF  3%  WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  HIGHER PRICING OF 1%  . THE DECREASE IN VOLUMES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER SALE OF EQUIPMENT ACTIVITY ON THE JAZAN PROJECT AND A PRIOR YEAR EQUIPMENT SALE RESULTING FROM A CONTRACT TERMINATION IN THE INDUSTRIAL GASES \u2013 ASIA SEGMENT. EXCLUDING THESE ITEMS, VOLUMES INCREASED 5% DUE TO BASE BUSINESS GROWTH ACROSS THE REGIONAL INDUSTRIAL GASES SEGMENTS AND THE FULL ONSTREAM OF THE LU\u2019AN PROJECT IN ASIA. PRICING ALSO IMPROVED ACROSS THE REGIONAL SEGMENTS, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR MERCHANT BUSINESS.

ADJUSTED EBITDA PROVIDES A USEFUL METRIC FOR MANAGEMENT TO ASSESS OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  ADJUSTED EBITDA OF  $794.9  INCREASED  8%  , OR  $60.0  , PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VOLUMES, POSITIVE PRICING, AND HIGHER INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AND UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACTS. ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN OF  35.7%  INCREASED  250  BP, PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE VOLUMES, HIGHER INCOME FROM EQUITY AFFILIATES, AND POSITIVE PRICING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ENERGY AND NATURAL GAS COST PASS-THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS AND HIGHER OPERATING COSTS.  EQUITY AFFILIATES' INCOME  EQUITY AFFILIATES' INCOME OF  $52.9  INCREASED  $39.1  , PRIMARILY DUE TO A PRIOR YEAR EXPENSE OF  $32.5  RESULTING FROM THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT.

FACILITY CLOSURE  IN DECEMBER 2018, ONE OF OUR CUSTOMERS WAS SUBJECT TO A GOVERNMENT ENFORCED SHUTDOWN DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS. AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED A CHARGE OF  $29.0  (  $22.1  AFTER-TAX, OR  $.10  PER SHARE), PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE WRITE-OFF OF ONSITE ASSETS, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019. THIS CHARGE IS REFLECTED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS AS \u201c  FACILITY CLOSURE  \u201d AND HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT RESULTS. ANNUAL SALES AND OPERATING INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CUSTOMER PRIOR TO THE FACILITY CLOSURE WERE NOT MATERIAL TO THE INDUSTRIAL GASES \u2013 ASIA SEGMENT. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL CHARGES RELATED TO THIS SHUTDOWN.  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE OF  $189.6  DECREASED  1%  , OR  $2.0  .

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE EQUALS THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DIVIDED BY INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE TAXES. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  27.0%  AND  64.2%  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL YEARS  2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. IN DECEMBER 2017, THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\"THE TAX ACT\") WAS ENACTED, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED EXISTING U.S. TAX LAWS, INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN THE FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, A DEEMED REPATRIATION TAX ON UNREMITTED FOREIGN EARNINGS, AS WELL AS OTHER CHANGES. THE CHANGE IN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE DISCRETE TAX IMPACTS RELATED TO THE TAX ACT. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, WE RECORDED A DISCRETE NET TAX EXPENSE OF $40.6 TO FINALIZE OUR ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACTS OF THE TAX ACT. THE NET EXPENSE INCLUDES THE REVERSAL OF THE $56.2 BENEFIT RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 RELATED TO THE U.S. TAXATION OF DEEMED FOREIGN DIVIDENDS. WE RECORDED THIS REVERSAL BASED ON OUR INTENT TO FOLLOW PROPOSED REGULATIONS THAT WERE ISSUED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. ADDITIONALLY, WE RECORDED A BENEFIT OF $15.6 TO FINALIZE OUR ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACTS OF THE TAX ACT AND REDUCE THE TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS OF THE DEEMED REPATRIATION TAX. OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 REFLECTS A DISCRETE NET INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $206.5 FOR OUR INITIAL PROVISIONAL ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACTS OF THE TAX ACT.  ON A NON-GAAP BASIS, THE ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  INCREASED  FROM  17.5%  IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  TO  19.0%  IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ON SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER BENEFITS FROM FOREIGN TAX LAW CHANGES ENACTED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER. OTHER THAN THE DISCRETE NET TAX IMPACTS DISCUSSED ABOVE, OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE TAX ACT DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OUR NON-GAAP EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2018 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  (MILLIONS OF DOLLARS UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, EXCEPT FOR PER SHARE DATA)  THE COMPANY HAS PRESENTED CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES ON A NON-GAAP (\u201cADJUSTED\u201d) BASIS AND HAS PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT MEANT TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES PROVIDE INVESTORS, POTENTIAL INVESTORS, SECURITIES ANALYSTS, AND OTHERS WITH USEFUL INFORMATION TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS BECAUSE SUCH MEASURES, WHEN VIEWED TOGETHER WITH OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, PROVIDE A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS AND TRENDS AFFECTING OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTED FUTURE RESULTS.  IN MANY CASES, OUR NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE DETERMINED BY ADJUSTING THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN DISCLOSED ITEMS (\u201cNON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS\u201d) THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN FISCAL YEARS 2017 AND 2016, WE RESTRUCTURED THE COMPANY TO FOCUS ON ITS CORE INDUSTRIAL GASES BUSINESS. THIS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT COST REDUCTION AND ASSET ACTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE WERE IMPORTANT FOR READERS TO UNDERSTAND SEPARATELY FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE RECORDED DISCRETE IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TAX ACT SINCE ITS ENACTMENT IN DECEMBER 2017. THE READER SHOULD BE AWARE THAT WE MAY INCUR SIMILAR EXPENSES IN THE FUTURE. READERS SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER THE LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL LACK OF COMPARABILITY OF THESE MEASURES FROM ONE COMPANY TO ANOTHER.  THE TAX IMPACT ON OUR PRE-TAX NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS REFLECTS THE EXPECTED CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSE IMPACT OF THE TRANSACTIONS AND IS IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY THE STATUTORY TAX RATE OF THE VARIOUS RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS AND THE TAXABILITY OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RECONCILIATIONS OF REPORTED GAAP RESULTS TO OUR NON-GAAP MEASURES FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF FISCAL YEARS  2019  AND  2018  ARE PRESENTED BELOW.

WE WANT OUR COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE TO MAKE IT A LEADER IN OUR INDUSTRY.  WE ARE HEADQUARTERED IN HOUSTON, TEXAS.

THE INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE IS NOT, AND SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE, A PART OF THIS FORM 10-Q OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO ANY OF OUR OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SEC.  AS OF  DECEMBER 19, 2018  , WE OWNED AND OPERATED  140  RESTAURANTS, OF WHICH  82  ARE TRADITIONAL CAFETERIAS,  57  ARE GOURMET HAMBURGER RESTAURANTS, AND ONE IS A CASUAL DINING RESTAURANT AND BAR. THESE ESTABLISHMENTS ARE LOCATED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO RETAIL CENTERS, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS MOSTLY THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. INCLUDED IN THE  140  RESTAURANTS THAT WE OWN AND OPERATE ARE 12 RESTAURANTS LOCATED AT SIX PROPERTY LOCATIONS WHERE WE OPERATE A SIDE-BY-SIDE LUBY\u2019S CAFETERIA AND FUDDRUCKERS ON THE SAME PROPERTY. WE REFER TO THESE LOCATIONS AS \u201cCOMBO LOCATIONS.\u201d  AS OF  DECEMBER 19, 2018  , WE OPERATED  30  CULINARY CONTRACT SERVICES LOCATIONS. WE OPERATED 22 OF THESE LOCATIONS IN THE HOUSTON, TEXAS AREA, THREE IN THE TEXAS LOWER RIO GRANDE VALLEY, TWO IN DALLAS, TEXAS, AND TWO IN SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS.

FIFTEEN  FRANCHISE OWNERS EACH OWN TWO TO FOUR RESTAURANTS. THE  21  REMAINING FRANCHISE OWNERS EACH OWN ONE RESTAURANT.  ACCOUNTING PERIODS  THE COMPANY\u2019S FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON THE LAST WEDNESDAY IN AUGUST. ACCORDINGLY, EACH FISCAL YEAR NORMALLY CONSISTS OF 13 FOUR-WEEK PERIODS, OR ACCOUNTING PERIODS, ACCOUNTING FOR 364 DAYS IN THE AGGREGATE. HOWEVER, EVERY FIFTH OR SIXTH YEAR, WE HAVE A FISCAL YEAR THAT CONSISTS OF 53 WEEKS, ACCOUNTING FOR 371 DAYS IN THE AGGREGATE. THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER CONSISTS OF FOUR FOUR-WEEK PERIODS, OR 16 WEEKS, AND THE REMAINING THREE QUARTERS TYPICALLY INCLUDES THREE FOUR-WEEK PERIODS, OR 12 WEEKS, IN LENGTH. THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER INCLUDES 13 WEEKS IN CERTAIN FISCAL YEARS TO ADJUST FOR OUR STANDARD 52 WEEK, OR 364 DAY, FISCAL YEAR COMPARED TO THE 365 DAY CALENDAR YEAR. COMPARABILITY BETWEEN QUARTERS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE VARYING LENGTHS OF THE QUARTERS, AS WELL AS THE SEASONALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS.  SAME-STORE SALES  THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT TO FOOD QUALITY, CONCEPT, LOCATION, PRICE, AND SERVICE, ALL OF WHICH MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON SAME-STORE SALES. OUR SAME-STORE SALES CALCULATION MEASURES THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF A CERTAIN GROUP OF RESTAURANTS. A RESTAURANT\u2019S SALES RESULTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE SAME-STORE SALES CALCULATION IN THE QUARTER AFTER A STORE HAS BEEN OPEN FOR SIX CONSECUTIVE FISCAL QUARTERS. STORES THAT CLOSE ON A PERMANENT BASIS (OR ON A TEMPORARY BASIS FOR REMODELING) ARE REMOVED FROM THE GROUP IN THE QUARTER WHEN OPERATIONS CEASE AT THE RESTAURANT, BUT REMAIN IN THE SAME-STORE GROUP FOR PREVIOUSLY REPORTED QUARTERS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS APPROACH LEADS TO MORE EFFECTIVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISONS, NEITHER THE TIME FRAME NOR THE EXACT PRACTICE MAY BE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY OTHER RESTAURANT COMPANIES.  33  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 19, 2018  COMPARED TO QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 20, 2017  COMPARABILITY BETWEEN QUARTERS IS AFFECTED BY THE VARYING LENGTHS OF THE QUARTERS AND QUARTERS ENDING AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN THE CALENDAR YEAR WHEN SEASONAL PATTERNS FOR SALES ARE DIFFERENT.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A GLOBAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION AND DERIVE OUR OPERATING REVENUES AND NET INCOME FROM PROVIDING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SERVICES TO INVESTORS IN JURISDICTIONS WORLDWIDE THROUGH OUR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS WHICH INCLUDE OUR SPONSORED FUNDS, AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONAL AND HIGH NET-WORTH SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. IN ADDITION TO INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, OUR SERVICES INCLUDE FUND ADMINISTRATION, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION, MARKETING, SHAREHOLDER SERVICING AND OTHER SERVICES. OUR PRODUCTS AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SERVICES ARE DISTRIBUTED OR MARKETED TO INVESTORS GLOBALLY UNDER VARIOUS DISTINCT BRAND NAMES, INCLUDING: FRANKLIN  \u00ae  , TEMPLETON  \u00ae  , FRANKLIN MUTUAL SERIES  \u00ae  , FRANKLIN BISSETT  \u00ae  , FIDUCIARY TRUSTTM, DARBY  \u00ae  , BALANCED EQUITY MANAGEMENT  \u00ae  , K2  \u00ae  , LIBERTYSHARES  \u00ae  AND EDINBURGH PARTNERSTM. WE OFFER A BROAD PRODUCT MIX OF EQUITY, MULTI-ASSET/BALANCED, FIXED INCOME AND CASH MANAGEMENT FUNDS AND ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT PRODUCTS, WHICH MEET A WIDE VARIETY OF SPECIFIC INVESTMENT NEEDS OF INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS. WE ALSO PROVIDE SUB-ADVISORY SERVICES TO CERTAIN INVESTMENT PRODUCTS SPONSORED BY OTHER COMPANIES WHICH MAY BE SOLD TO INVESTORS UNDER THE BRAND NAMES OF THOSE OTHER COMPANIES OR ON A CO-BRANDED BASIS.  THE LEVEL OF OUR REVENUES DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE LEVEL AND RELATIVE MIX OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT (\u201cAUM\u201d). AS NOTED IN THE \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTION SET FORTH BELOW, THE AMOUNT AND MIX OF OUR AUM ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS AND CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND INCOME. THE LEVEL OF OUR REVENUES ALSO DEPENDS ON MUTUAL FUND SALES, THE NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDER TRANSACTIONS AND ACCOUNTS, AND THE FEES CHARGED FOR OUR SERVICES, WHICH ARE BASED ON CONTRACTS WITH OUR FUNDS OR OUR CLIENTS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.  DURING OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER, THE GLOBAL EQUITY MARKETS EXPERIENCED SHARP DECLINES AS THE S&P 500 INDEX AND MSCI WORLD INDEX DECREASED  13.5%  AND  13.3%  AMID ONGOING CONCERNS ABOUT SLOWING ECONOMIC GROWTH, GLOBAL TRADE TENSIONS AND RISING INTEREST RATES, AMONG OTHER THINGS. THE GLOBAL BOND MARKETS WERE POSITIVE AS THE BLOOMBERG BARCLAYS GLOBAL AGGREGATE INDEX INCREASED  1.2%  DURING THE QUARTER.  OUR TOTAL AUM AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS  $649.9 BILLION  ,  9%  LOWER  THAN AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  AND  14%  LOWER  THAN AT  DECEMBER 31, 2017  . SIMPLE MONTHLY AVERAGE AUM (\u201cAVERAGE AUM\u201d) FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  DECREASED  9%  FROM THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY REMAIN FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS WE CONTINUE TO CONFRONT THE CHALLENGES OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS, WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON THE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND ON PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY SERVICE TO OUR CLIENTS. WE CONTINUOUSLY PERFORM REVIEWS OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL. WHILE WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON EXPENSE MANAGEMENT, WE WILL ALSO SEEK TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND DEVELOP EMPLOYEES AND INVEST STRATEGICALLY IN SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL PROVIDE A SECURE AND STABLE ENVIRONMENT. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK TO PROTECT AND FURTHER OUR BRAND RECOGNITION WHILE DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING BROKER-DEALER AND CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW  A KEY DRIVER OF OUR OVERALL SUCCESS IS THE LONG-TERM INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS. A STANDARD MEASURE OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE PRODUCTS IS THE PERCENTAGE OF AUM EXCEEDING BENCHMARKS AND PEER GROUP MEDIANS. OUR GLOBAL/INTERNATIONAL FIXED INCOME PRODUCTS GENERATED NOTABLE LONG-TERM RESULTS WITH AT LEAST 90% OF AUM EXCEEDING THE BENCHMARK AND PEER GROUP MEDIAN COMPARISONS FOR THE TEN-YEAR PERIOD. HIGHER RELATIVE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE BY THESE PRODUCTS DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES FROM  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  TO THE BENCHMARK AND PEER GROUP MEDIAN COMPARISONS FOR THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD. THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR MULTI-ASSET/BALANCED PRODUCTS SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED THE PEER GROUP MEDIANS FOR THE THREE- AND TEN-YEAR PERIODS, BUT HAS LAGGED IN THE FIVE-YEAR COMPARISON AND AGAINST THE BENCHMARKS FOR THE ONE- AND FIVE-YEAR PERIODS, REFLECTING THE PERFORMANCE OF A FUND THAT REPRESENTS  67%  OF THIS CATEGORY. HIGHER RELATIVE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE BY THIS FUND DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES FROM  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  TO THE BENCHMARK COMPARISONS FOR THE THREE- AND TEN-YEAR PERIODS AND THE PEER GROUP MEDIAN COMPARISON FOR THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD.

ANNUAL FEE RATES VARY BY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND TYPE OF SERVICES PROVIDED. FEE RATES FOR PRODUCTS SOLD OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. ARE GENERALLY HIGHER THAN FOR U.S. PRODUCTS.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES  DECREASED  $141.8 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO A  9%  DECREASE IN AVERAGE AUM, A LOWER EFFECTIVE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE RATE AND A  $15.5 MILLION  DECREASE FROM A CHANGE IN PRESENTATION OF CERTAIN FEES FROM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES TO DISTRIBUTION FEES UPON ADOPTION OF NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON  OCTOBER 1, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN AVERAGE AUM OCCURRED PRIMARILY IN THE GLOBAL/INTERNATIONAL AND MULTI-ASSET/BALANCED INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, AND ACROSS ALL SALES REGIONS, MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA.  OUR EFFECTIVE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE RATE (ANNUALIZED INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES DIVIDED BY AVERAGE AUM) DECREASED TO  56.9  BASIS POINTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , FROM  59.2  BASIS POINTS FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE RATE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOWER WEIGHTING OF AUM IN THE GLOBAL/INTERNATIONAL EQUITY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, WHICH GENERALLY HAS THE HIGHEST FEE RATES, ALONG WITH A HIGHER MIX OF AUM IN LOWER FEE PRODUCTS WITHIN THE U.S. AND EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA SALES REGIONS FOR THIS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, AND THE  $15.5 MILLION  DECREASE FROM THE CHANGE IN PRESENTATION OF CERTAIN FEES DISCUSSED ABOVE.  PERFORMANCE-BASED INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES WERE  $4.1 MILLION  AND  $1.8 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  , WITH THE INCREASE PRIMARILY DUE TO FEES EARNED FROM A REAL ESTATE FUND.  OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND GLOBAL OPERATIONS ARE DIVERSE. AS SUCH, THE IMPACT OF FUTURE CHANGES IN AUM ON INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE RELATIVE MIX OF INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE, GEOGRAPHIC REGION, DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL AND INVESTMENT VEHICLE OF THE ASSETS.  SALES AND DISTRIBUTION FEES  SALES AND DISTRIBUTION FEES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF UPFRONT SALES COMMISSIONS AND ONGOING DISTRIBUTION FEES. SALES COMMISSIONS ARE EARNED FROM THE SALE OF CERTAIN CLASSES OF SPONSORED FUNDS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE (\u201cCOMMISSIONABLE SALES\u201d) AND MAY BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT INVESTED AND THE TYPE OF INVESTOR. THEREFORE, SALES FEES WILL CHANGE WITH THE OVERALL LEVEL OF GROSS SALES, THE SIZE OF INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTIONS, AND THE RELATIVE MIX OF SALES BETWEEN DIFFERENT SHARE CLASSES AND TYPES OF INVESTORS.  OUR SPONSORED MUTUAL FUNDS AND CERTAIN OTHER PRODUCTS GENERALLY PAY US DISTRIBUTION FEES IN RETURN FOR SALES, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION EFFORTS ON THEIR BEHALF. THE MAJORITY OF U.S.-REGISTERED MUTUAL FUNDS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CERTAIN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, HAVE ADOPTED DISTRIBUTION PLANS UNDER RULE 12B-1 (THE \u201cRULE 12B-1 PLANS\u201d) PROMULGATED UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940.

THE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A  $15.5 MILLION  INCREASE FROM A CHANGE IN PRESENTATION OF CERTAIN FEES TO DISTRIBUTION FEES FROM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES UPON ADOPTION OF NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON  OCTOBER 1, 2018.  SALES-BASED FEES DECREASED  $24.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO A  $25.3 MILLION  DECREASE  FROM A  38%  DECREASE  IN TOTAL COMMISSIONABLE SALES.

THIS INCREASE WAS SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY FEE DECREASES PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM LOWER LEVELS OF RELATED AUM.  OTHER  OTHER REVENUE  INCREASED  $0.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME FROM CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENT PRODUCTS (\u201cCIPS\u201d).

THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A  $4.2 MILLION  INCREASE  FROM THE RECOGNITION OF SALES COMMISSIONS ON U.S. CLASS C SHARES AS EXPENSE AT THE TIME OF SALE, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TREATMENT OF CONTRACT COSTS WITH A USEFUL LIFE OF ONE YEAR OR LESS UNDER NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ADOPTED ON  OCTOBER 1, 2018  . THE COMMISSIONS RELATE TO SHARES SOLD WITHOUT A FRONT-END SALES CHARGE AND WERE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED OVER ONE YEAR IN PRIOR PERIODS.  AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED SALES COMMISSIONS  INCREASED  $2.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES OF NON-U.S. SHARES SOLD WITHOUT A FRONT-END SALES CHARGE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING FOR U.S. CLASS C SHARES DISCUSSED ABOVE WHICH RESULTED IN NO FURTHER DEFERRAL AND AMORTIZATION. THE UNAMORTIZED DEFERRED CLASS C COMMISSION BALANCE OF  $9.1 MILLION  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  WAS REVERSED AGAINST RETAINED EARNINGS UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.

VARIABLE COMPENSATION INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES OF  $4.6 MILLION  FOR RETENTION BONUSES RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS AND  $1.1 MILLION  RELATED TO PRODUCT PERFORMANCE FEES.  VARIABLE COMPENSATION AS A PERCENTAGE OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS WAS  33%  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  .

WE CONTINUE TO PLACE A HIGH EMPHASIS ON OUR PAY FOR PERFORMANCE PHILOSOPHY. AS SUCH, ANY CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS OR CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF OUR INCENTIVE COMPENSATION OFFERINGS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT EXPENSES GOING FORWARD. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED INDIVIDUALS, OUR LEVEL OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT EXPENSES MAY INCREASE MORE QUICKLY OR DECREASE MORE SLOWLY THAN OUR REVENUE.

EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES GENERATED LOSSES OF  $37.6 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO INCOME OF  $35.2 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS HELD BY A GLOBAL EQUITY FUND AS COMPARED TO GAINS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. INVESTMENTS OF CIPS GENERATED NET LOSSES OF  $49.0 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO NET GAINS OF  $16.0 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE LOSSES WERE PRIMARILY FROM LOWER MARKET VALUATIONS OF HOLDINGS BY VARIOUS GLOBAL/INTERNATIONAL EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME FUNDS, A MULTI-ASSET/BALANCED FUND AND A U.S. FIXED INCOME FUND. INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE COMPANY GENERATED NET LOSSES OF  $15.8 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO NET GAINS OF  $0.6 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE LOSSES PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM LOWER MARKET VALUATIONS OF VARIOUS NONCONSOLIDATED FUNDS AND OTHER DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. INTEREST INCOME DECREASED  $14.8 MILLION  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER LEVELS OF CASH EQUIVALENTS AND DEBT SECURITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST RATES. THE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A  $20.9 MILLION  INCREASE IN DIVIDEND INCOME PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN, AND YIELDS ON, MONEY MARKET FUNDS.

THE TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY OF  $982.8 MILLION  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  IS NET OF AN  $87.6 MILLION  TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO U.S. TAXATION OF DEEMED FOREIGN DIVIDENDS. THIS BENEFIT MAY BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED BY FUTURE REGULATION OR LEGISLATION. THE TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY MAY ALSO BE ADJUSTED IN THE FUTURE UPON ISSUANCE OF STATE LEGISLATIVE UPDATES ON TAX REFORM AND THE COMPLETION OF OUR TAX RETURN FILINGS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018.  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS  24.9%  AND  187.8%  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  . THE RATE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PRIOR YEAR IMPACT OF THE TRANSITION TAX, NET OF THE TAX BENEFIT FROM THE REVALUATION OF NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AT THE LOWER STATUTORY RATE, AND THE CURRENT YEAR IMPACT OF THE LOWER  21%  STATUTORY RATE AS COMPARED TO A BLENDED STATUTORY RATE OF  24.5%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS WILL CONTINUE TO REFLECT THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF EARNINGS BY JURISDICTIONS.

NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NET SUBSCRIPTIONS IN CIPS BY NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND HIGHER REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK.  THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF CIPS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS DO NOT IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO THE CIPS\u2019 ASSETS, OTHER THAN OUR DIRECT EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THEM AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES EARNED FROM THEM. THE DEBT HOLDERS OF THE CIPS HAVE NO RECOURSE TO OUR ASSETS BEYOND THE LEVEL OF OUR DIRECT INVESTMENT, THEREFORE WE BEAR NO OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CIPS\u2019 LIABILITIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF CIPS, OTHER THAN OUR DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN THEM, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE AMOUNTS AND DISCUSSION BELOW.  OUR LIQUID ASSETS AND DEBT CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING.  (IN MILLIONS)  DECEMBER 31,  2018  SEPTEMBER 30,  2018  ASSETS  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $6,430.7  $6,610.8  RECEIVABLES  723.9  733.7  INVESTMENTS  1,985.0  2,130.6  TOTAL LIQUID ASSETS  $9,139.6  $9,475.1  LIABILITY  DEBT  $697.7  $695.9  LIQUIDITY  LIQUID ASSETS CONSIST OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES AND CERTAIN INVESTMENTS. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  PRIMARILY CONSIST OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND DEPOSITS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. LIQUID INVESTMENTS CONSIST OF DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN REDEEMABLE CIPS, INVESTMENTS IN SPONSORED AND OTHER FUNDS, OTHER EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES AND TIME DEPOSITS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS.  WE UTILIZE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR LIQUID ASSETS TO SATISFY OPERATIONAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND FUND CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS RELATING TO OUR PRODUCTS. CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED BY OUR INTERNAL POLICY OR REGULATION TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM LEVELS OF CAPITAL WHICH ARE PARTIALLY MAINTAINED BY RETAINING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. AS A RESULT, SUCH SUBSIDIARIES MAY BE RESTRICTED IN THEIR ABILITY TO TRANSFER CASH TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , OUR SUBSIDIARIES HELD  $3,340.4 MILLION  OF LIQUID ASSETS TO SATISFY OPERATIONAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PRODUCTS, AS COMPARED TO  $3,382.6 MILLION  HELD AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  . INCLUDED IN THESE AMOUNTS WERE LIQUID ASSETS RESTRICTED BY REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FROM TRANSFER TO FRANKLIN AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF  $242.8 MILLION  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  $252.6 MILLION  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  . SHOULD WE REQUIRE MORE CAPITAL THAN IS AVAILABLE FOR USE, WE COULD ELECT TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS SHARE REPURCHASES, OR WE COULD RAISE CAPITAL THROUGH DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUANCE. THESE ALTERNATIVES COULD RESULT IN INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE OR OTHER DILUTION TO OUR EARNINGS.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN MEET OUR PRESENT AND REASONABLY FORESEEABLE OPERATING CASH NEEDS AND FUTURE COMMITMENTS THROUGH EXISTING LIQUID ASSETS, CONTINUING CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, THE ABILITY TO ISSUE DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES AND BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR UNCOMMITTED PRIVATE PLACEMENT PROGRAM.  IN PRIOR FISCAL YEARS, WE ISSUED SENIOR UNSECURED UNSUBORDINATED NOTES FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, TO REDEEM OUTSTANDING NOTES AND TO FINANCE AN ACQUISITION. AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  ,  $699.3 MILLION  OF THE NOTES WERE OUTSTANDING WITH AN AGGREGATE FACE VALUE OF  $700.0 MILLION  . THE NOTES WERE ISSUED AT FIXED INTEREST RATES AND CONSIST OF  $300.0 MILLION  AT  2.800%  PER ANNUM WHICH MATURE IN  2022  AND  $400.0 MILLION  AT  2.850%  PER ANNUM WHICH MATURE IN  2025.  INTEREST ON THE NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY. THE NOTES CONTAIN AN OPTIONAL REDEMPTION FEATURE THAT ALLOWS US TO REDEEM EACH SERIES OF NOTES PRIOR TO MATURITY IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT ANY TIME, AT A MAKE-WHOLE REDEMPTION PRICE. THE INDENTURES GOVERNING THE NOTES CONTAIN LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY AND THE ABILITY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO PLEDGE VOTING STOCK OR PROFIT PARTICIPATING EQUITY INTERESTS IN OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO SECURE OTHER DEBT WITHOUT SIMILARLY SECURING THE NOTES EQUALLY AND RATABLY. THE INDENTURES ALSO INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS THAT MUST BE MET IF WE CONSOLIDATE OR MERGE WITH, OR SELL ALL OF OUR ASSETS TO, ANOTHER ENTITY. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL DEBT COVENANTS AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD  $500.0 MILLION  OF SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER AN UNCOMMITTED PRIVATE PLACEMENT PROGRAM WHICH HAS BEEN INACTIVE SINCE  2012.  OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS IN A TIMELY MANNER DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR CREDIT RATING, THE CONDITION OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, INVESTORS\u2019 WILLINGNESS TO PURCHASE OUR SECURITIES, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT SPREADS AND THE VALUATION LEVELS OF EQUITY MARKETS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS IN A TIMELY MANNER, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.  USES OF CAPITAL  WE EXPECT THAT OUR MAIN USES OF CASH WILL BE TO INVEST IN AND GROW OUR BUSINESS, REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, INVEST IN OUR PRODUCTS, FUND PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES, PAY OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE BUSINESS, ENHANCE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUSINESS PROCESSES, PAY STOCKHOLDER DIVIDENDS AND INCOME TAXES, AND REPAY AND SERVICE DEBT.  WE DECLARE DIVIDENDS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. WE DECLARED REGULAR DIVIDENDS OF  $0.26  AND  $0.23  PER SHARE DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  2017  . WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO CONTINUE PAYING COMPARABLE REGULAR DIVIDENDS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK DEPENDING UPON EARNINGS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS.  WE MAINTAIN A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO MANAGE OUR EQUITY CAPITAL WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF MAXIMIZING SHAREHOLDER VALUE. OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EFFECTED THROUGH REGULAR OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES AND PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO AN EXPIRATION DATE. THE SIZE AND TIMING OF THESE PURCHASES WILL DEPEND ON PRICE, MARKET AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. WE REPURCHASED  10.7 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A COST OF  $326.9 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , AND  4.6 MILLION  SHARES AT A COST OF  $200.0 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  ,  61.0 MILLION  SHARES REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER THE AUTHORIZATION APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN APRIL 2018.  WE INVESTED  $6.5 MILLION  , NET OF REDEMPTIONS, INTO OUR SPONSORED PRODUCTS DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , AND REDEEMED  $91.3 MILLION  , NET OF INVESTMENTS, IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.  ON  OCTOBER 24, 2018  , WE ENTERED INTO AN ACQUISITION AGREEMENT WITH A PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY  $683 MILLION  IN CASH.  THE FUNDS THAT WE MANAGE HAVE THEIR OWN RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR PURPOSES OF PROVIDING LIQUIDITY TO MEET SHAREHOLDER REDEMPTIONS, INCLUDING SECURITIES THAT CAN BE SOLD OR PROVIDED TO INVESTORS AS IN-KIND REDEMPTIONS, AND LINES OF CREDIT. WHILE WE HAVE NO CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO DO SO, WE MAY VOLUNTARILY ELECT TO PROVIDE THE FUNDS WITH DIRECT OR INDIRECT FINANCIAL SUPPORT BASED ON OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. WE DID NOT PROVIDE FINANCIAL OR OTHER SUPPORT TO OUR SPONSORED FUNDS DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . DURING FISCAL YEAR  2018  , WE PURCHASED  $32.6 MILLION  OF CERTAIN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES FROM TWO SPONSORED FUNDS. NONE OF THESE PURCHASES OCCURRED DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITY  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITY AND FEDERAL TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY AS REPORTED IN OUR FORM 10\u2010K FOR FISCAL YEAR  2018.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHICH REQUIRE THE USE OF ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. THESE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY OUR APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES. THE FOLLOWING ARE UPDATES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCLOSED IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN OUR FORM 10-K FOR FISCAL YEAR  2018.  CONSOLIDATION  WE CONSOLIDATE OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND INVESTMENT PRODUCTS IN WHICH WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST. WE HAVE A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST WHEN WE OWN A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING INTEREST IN A VOTING INTEREST ENTITY (\u201cVOE\u201d) OR ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (\u201cVIE\u201d). SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR VIES ARE INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND OUR VARIABLE INTERESTS CONSIST OF OUR EQUITY OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES EARNED FROM THESE PRODUCTS. AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE WERE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF 32 INVESTMENT PRODUCT VIES.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF OUR INVESTMENTS IS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE OR AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS. WE USE A THREE-LEVEL FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY THAT PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE BASED ON WHETHER THE INPUTS TO THOSE VALUATION TECHNIQUES ARE OBSERVABLE OR UNOBSERVABLE.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , LEVEL 3 ASSETS REPRESENTED  14%  OF TOTAL ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH RELATED TO CIPS\u2019 INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES. THERE WAS ONE LEVEL 3 LIABILITY, A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY WHICH WAS THE ONLY LIABILITY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THERE WERE  $31.1 MILLION  OF TRANSFERS OUT OF AND INSIGNIFICANT TRANSFERS INTO LEVEL 3 DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  WE ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON  OCTOBER 1, 2018  THAT REQUIRES SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES TO BE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE WITH CHANGES RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS, EXCEPT FOR THOSE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. THE POLICY DESCRIPTION FOR EQUITY SECURITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AND THEIR FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGIES IS AS FOLLOWS.  EQUITY SECURITIES, AT FAIR VALUE  CONSIST OF INVESTMENTS IN NONCONSOLIDATED SPONSORED FUNDS AND OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS GAINS AND LOSSES IN EARNINGS. THE FAIR VALUE OF FUNDS IS DETERMINED BASED ON THEIR PUBLISHED NET ASSET VALUE (\u201cNAV\u201d) OR ESTIMATED USING NAV AS A PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY SECURITIES OTHER THAN FUNDS IS DETERMINED USING INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY BROKER OR DEALER PRICE QUOTES OR BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS.  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  SUBSEQUENT TO OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS AS OF AUGUST 1,  2018  , THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENTS TO GOODWILL OR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. WE MONITORED MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN OUR AUM AND WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE ANNUAL CALCULATIONS OF FAIR VALUE TO DETERMINE WHETHER CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CHANGED THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE, OR INDICATE THAT THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS MIGHT BE IMPAIRED. WE ALSO MONITORED FLUCTUATIONS OF OUR COMMON STOCK PER SHARE PRICE TO EVALUATE OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION RELATIVE TO THE REPORTING UNIT AS A WHOLE.  WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE IN OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS ARE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE, FUTURE CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD RESULT IN RECOGNITION OF IMPAIRMENT.  REVENUES  WE EARN REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM PROVIDING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY INVESTMENT PRODUCTS OR INVESTORS IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. IN ADDITION TO INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, SERVICES INCLUDE FUND ADMINISTRATION, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION, AND SHAREHOLDER SERVICING. REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN OUR OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THE SERVICES ARE SATISFIED AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL OF THE REVENUE AMOUNT WOULD NOT OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED OVER TIME AS THE SERVICES ARE RENDERED, EXCEPT FOR THE SALES AND DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS FOR THE SALE OF SHARES OF SPONSORED FUNDS, WHICH ARE SATISFIED ON TRADE DATE. MULTIPLE SERVICES INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY WHEN THE OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED TO BE DISTINCT.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FEES FROM PROVIDING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND FUND ADMINISTRATION SERVICES (\u201cINVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES\u201d), OTHER THAN PERFORMANCE-BASED INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES, ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF AUM, PRIMARILY ON A MONTHLY BASIS USING DAILY AVERAGE AUM, AND ARE RECOGNIZED AS THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED OVER TIME. PERFORMANCE-BASED INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES ARE GENERATED WHEN WE EXCEED PERFORMANCE TARGETS ESTABLISHED IN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS. THESE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE AMOUNT IS NO LONGER PROBABLE OF SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL AND MAY RELATE TO INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES THAT WERE PROVIDED IN PRIOR PERIODS.  SALES AND DISTRIBUTION FEES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF UPFRONT SALES COMMISSIONS AND ONGOING DISTRIBUTION FEES. SALES COMMISSIONS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL RATES FOR SALES OF CERTAIN CLASSES OF SPONSORED FUNDS AND ARE RECOGNIZED ON TRADE DATE. DISTRIBUTION SERVICE FEES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF AUM, PRIMARILY ON A MONTHLY BASIS USING DAILY AVERAGE AUM. AS THE FEE AMOUNTS ARE UNCERTAIN ON TRADE DATE THEY ARE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME AS THE AMOUNTS BECOME KNOWN AND MAY RELATE TO SALES AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES PROVIDED IN PRIOR PERIODS.  SHAREHOLDER SERVICING FEES ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF AUM ON A MONTHLY BASIS USING DAILY AVERAGE AUM AND EITHER THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN SHAREHOLDER ACCOUNTS OR THE NUMBER OF SHAREHOLDER ACCOUNTS, WHILE FEES FROM CERTAIN INVESTMENT PRODUCTS ARE BASED ONLY ON AUM. THESE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED AS THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED OVER TIME.  AUM IS GENERALLY BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES HELD BY OUR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND IS CALCULATED USING FAIR VALUE METHODS DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM UNADJUSTED QUOTED MARKET PRICES, UNADJUSTED INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY BROKER OR DEALER PRICE QUOTES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, OR MARKET PRICES OR PRICE QUOTES ADJUSTED FOR OBSERVABLE PRICE MOVEMENTS AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE PRIMARY MARKET IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S GLOBAL VALUATION AND PRICING POLICY. THE FAIR VALUES OF SECURITIES FOR WHICH MARKET PRICES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE ARE VALUED INTERNALLY USING VARIOUS METHODOLOGIES WHICH INCORPORATE SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AS APPROPRIATE FOR EACH SECURITY TYPE. AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , OUR TOTAL AUM BY FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY LEVEL WAS  49%  LEVEL 1,  50%  LEVEL 2 AND  1%  LEVEL 3. AS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR AUM IS VALUED BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES OR INPUTS, MARKET RISK IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK UNDERLYING THE VALUATION OF OUR AUM.  NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  SEE NOTE  2  \u2013 NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS FORM 10\u2010Q.  RISK FACTORS  VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION OF THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS, AND ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND MAY PUT PRESSURE ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  THE CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS MAY FROM TIME TO TIME EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION WORLDWIDE. DECLINES IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE IN THE PAST RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN OUR ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT (\u201cAUM\u201d), REVENUES AND INCOME, AND FUTURE DECLINES MAY FURTHER NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. SUCH DECLINES HAVE HAD AND MAY IN THE FUTURE HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE MAY NEED TO MODIFY OUR BUSINESS, STRATEGIES OR OPERATIONS AND WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS OR COSTS IN ORDER TO COMPETE IN A CHANGING GLOBAL ECONOMY AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT.  THE AMOUNT AND MIX OF OUR AUM ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS  . FLUCTUATIONS IN THE AMOUNT AND MIX OF OUR AUM MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE IN PART TO MARKET CONDITIONS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL THAT HAVE HAD, AND IN THE FUTURE COULD HAVE, A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES AND INCOME. WE DERIVE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR OPERATING REVENUES AND NET INCOME FROM PROVIDING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SERVICES TO INVESTORS IN JURISDICTIONS WORLDWIDE THROUGH OUR INVESTMENT PRODUCTS WHICH INCLUDE OUR SPONSORED FUNDS, AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONAL AND HIGH NET-WORTH SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. IN ADDITION TO INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, OUR SERVICES INCLUDE FUND ADMINISTRATION, SALES, DISTRIBUTION, MARKETING, SHAREHOLDER SERVICING, AND OTHER SERVICES. THE LEVEL OF OUR REVENUES DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE LEVEL AND MIX OF AUM. OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE VALUE OF AUM AND VARY WITH THE NATURE AND STRATEGIES OF OUR PRODUCTS. ANY DECREASE IN THE VALUE OR AMOUNT OF OUR AUM BECAUSE OF MARKET VOLATILITY OR OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS A DECLINE IN THE PRICE OF STOCKS, IN PARTICULAR MARKET SEGMENTS OR IN THE SECURITIES MARKET GENERALLY, NEGATIVELY IMPACTS OUR REVENUES AND INCOME. WE ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISK OF ASSET VOLATILITY FROM CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL, EQUITY, DEBT AND COMMODITY MARKETS. INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL, EQUITY, DEBT AND COMMODITY MARKETS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, ELECTORAL, DIPLOMATIC OR OTHER INSTABILITIES THAT ARE PARTICULAR TO THE COUNTRY OR REGION IN WHICH A MARKET IS LOCATED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOCAL ACTS OF TERRORISM, ECONOMIC CRISES, POLITICAL PROTESTS, INSURRECTION OR OTHER BUSINESS, SOCIAL OR POLITICAL CRISES. GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, EXACERBATED BY WAR, TERRORISM, NATURAL DISASTERS OR FINANCIAL CRISES, CHANGES IN THE EQUITY, DEBT OR COMMODITY MARKETPLACES, CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, INFLATION RATES, THE YIELD CURVE, DEFAULTS BY TRADING COUNTERPARTIES, BOND DEFAULTS, REVALUATION AND BOND MARKET LIQUIDITY RISKS, GEOPOLITICAL RISKS, THE IMPOSITION OF ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, AFFECT THE MIX, MARKET VALUES AND LEVELS OF OUR AUM. FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL MARKET PRICES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND/OR INTEREST RATES HAVE IN THE PAST AND COULD IN THE FUTURE CAUSE THE VALUE OF OUR AUM TO DECLINE, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN LOWER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUES. CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS COULD ALSO CAUSE AN IMPAIRMENT TO THE VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. OUR FUNDS MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIQUIDITY RISKS OR AN UNANTICIPATED LARGE NUMBER OF REDEMPTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE EVENTS OR CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, CAUSING THE FUNDS TO SELL SECURITIES THEY HOLD, POSSIBLY AT A LOSS, OR DRAW ON ANY AVAILABLE LINES OF CREDIT, TO OBTAIN CASH TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY OR SETTLE THESE REDEMPTIONS, OR SETTLE IN-KIND WITH SECURITIES HELD IN THE APPLICABLE FUND. WE HAVE IN THE PAST, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE, AT OUR DISCRETION, PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO OUR FUNDS TO ENABLE THEM TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY IN ANY SUCH EVENT. CHANGES IN INVESTOR PREFERENCES REGARDING OUR MORE POPULAR PRODUCTS HAVE IN THE PAST AND COULD IN THE FUTURE CAUSE SIZABLE REDEMPTIONS AND LOWER THE VALUE OF OUR AUM, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN LOWER REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS. MOREOVER, CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE A SHIFT IN OUR ASSET MIX BETWEEN INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. ASSETS, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN A DECLINE IN OUR REVENUES AND INCOME DEPENDING UPON THE NATURE OF OUR AUM AND THE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT FEES WE EARN BASED ON OUR AUM. WE GENERALLY DERIVE HIGHER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION FEES FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTS THAN FROM OUR U.S. PRODUCTS, AND HIGHER SALES FEES FROM OUR U.S. PRODUCTS THAN FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE A SHIFT IN OUR ASSET MIX TOWARDS FIXED INCOME PRODUCTS AND AWAY FROM EQUITY AND MULTI-ASSET/BALANCED PRODUCTS, AND A RELATED DECLINE IN OUR REVENUES AND INCOME, AS WE GENERALLY DERIVE HIGHER FEE REVENUES AND INCOME FROM OUR EQUITY AND CERTAIN MULTI-ASSET/BALANCED PRODUCTS THAN FROM OUR FIXED INCOME PRODUCTS. FURTHER, CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS AND INVESTOR PREFERENCES ALSO MAY CAUSE A SHIFT IN OUR ASSET MIX TOWARDS LOWER FEE EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS. INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES, IN PARTICULAR IF RAPID, AS WELL AS ANY UNCERTAINTY IN THE FUTURE DIRECTION OF INTEREST RATES, MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FIXED INCOME PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH THE SHORTER DURATION OF THE BOND INVESTMENTS IN MANY OF THESE PRODUCTS MAY HELP MITIGATE THE INTEREST RATE RISK, RISING INTEREST RATES OR INTEREST RATE UNCERTAINTY TYPICALLY DECREASE THE TOTAL RETURN ON MANY BOND INVESTMENTS DUE TO LOWER MARKET VALUATIONS OF EXISTING BONDS. ANY DECREASE IN THE LEVEL OF OUR AUM RESULTING FROM MARKET DECLINES, INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY OR UNCERTAINTY, INCREASED REDEMPTIONS OR OTHER FACTORS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND INCOME.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE, COMPLEX, OVERLAPPING AND FREQUENTLY CHANGING RULES, REGULATIONS, POLICIES, AND LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS.  THERE IS UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. AS DESCRIBED BELOW, OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE AND COMPLEX, OVERLAPPING AND/OR CONFLICTING, AND FREQUENTLY CHANGING AND INCREASING RULES, REGULATIONS, POLICIES AND LEGAL INTERPRETATIONS IN THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. OUR REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL AND COST BURDENS ON US AND COVER A BROAD RANGE OF REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO SECURITIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INVESTMENT AND ADVISORY MATTERS, ACCOUNTING, TAX, COMPENSATION, ETHICS, DATA PROTECTION, PRIVACY, SANCTIONS PROGRAMS, AND ESCHEATMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  AS A U.S. REPORTING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, STATE LAWS REGARDING SECURITIES FRAUD, OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND RULES AND REGULATIONS OF CERTAIN REGULATORY AND SELF-REGULATORY ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY, AMONG OTHERS, THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) AND THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE. AS A GLOBAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION, CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE SEC, THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY REGULATORY AUTHORITY, THE U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (\u201cCFTC\u201d), THE NATIONAL FUTURES ASSOCIATION, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (\u201cDOJ\u201d), THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (\u201cDOL\u201d) AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY. GIVEN OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS, OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE SECURITIES AND OTHER LAWS OF VARIOUS NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS, AND TO VARIOUS NON-U.S. AND CROSS-BORDER RULES AND REGULATIONS, SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN UNION\u2019S (\u201cEU\u201d) DATA PROTECTION RULES UNDER THE EU\u2019S GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (\u201cGDPR\u201d). OUR NON-U.S. REGULATORS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE UNITED KINGDOM (\u201cU.K.\u201d) FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY, THE LUXEMBOURG COMMISSION DE SURVEILLANCE DU SECTEUR FINANCIER, THE CANADIAN PROVINCIAL AND TERRITORIAL SECURITIES REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, THE MONETARY AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE, THE AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS COMMISSION, THE HONG KONG SECURITIES AND FUTURES COMMISSION, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA, THE JAPANESE FINANCIAL SERVICES AGENCY AND VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL STOCK EXCHANGES. OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY U.S. REGULATORS, INCLUDING THE SEC, THE CFTC AND THE DOJ (FOR EXAMPLE, WITH RESPECT TO THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT OF 1977). WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT NOT ONLY TO THE SANCTIONS PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\u2019S OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL, BUT ALSO TO SANCTIONS PROGRAMS ADOPTED AND ADMINISTERED BY NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING THE EU, WHERE OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS ARE OFFERED. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OF STATES AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS REGARDING THE REPORTING AND ESCHEATMENT OF UNCLAIMED OR ABANDONED PROPERTY. FURTHER, CERTAIN FEDERAL AND STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER OR BUSINESS COMBINATION LAWS MAY IMPOSE VARIOUS DISCLOSURE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE ABILITY OF A PERSON TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF US, WHICH MAY DISCOURAGE POTENTIAL MERGER AND ACQUISITION PROPOSALS AND MAY DELAY, DETER OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL, INCLUDING THROUGH TRANSACTIONS THAT SOME STOCKHOLDERS MAY CONSIDER DESIRABLE.  CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE REGISTERED WITH THE SEC UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940, THE CFTC AND/OR REGISTERED WITH OR LICENSED BY VARIOUS NON-U.S. REGULATORS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF OUR FUNDS ARE REGISTERED WITH THE SEC UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 (THE \u201cINVESTMENT COMPANY ACT\u201d) OR AUTHORIZED BY VARIOUS EUROPEAN AND OTHER NON-U.S. REGULATORS PURSUANT TO THE EU\u2019S UNDERTAKINGS FOR COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT IN TRANSFERABLE SECURITIES (\u201cUCITS\u201d) DIRECTIVE OR UNDER OTHER NON-U.S. LAWS IN EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA, ASIA-PACIFIC, CANADA AND LATIN AMERICA. THESE REGISTRATIONS, LICENSES AND AUTHORIZATIONS IMPOSE NUMEROUS OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS DETAILED OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS, ON SUCH SUBSIDIARIES AND SUCH FUNDS. OUR SUBSIDIARIES MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH COMPLEX TAX REGIMES.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, AND THE PROCESSES, CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THEM, ARE OFTEN COMPREHENSIVE AND COMPLEX. WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF NEW OR REVISED LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS OR BY CHANGES IN THE INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS. POLITICAL AND ELECTORAL CHANGES, DEVELOPMENTS AND CONFLICTS MAY ALSO INTRODUCE ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY. WHILE MANAGEMENT HAS FOCUSED ATTENTION AND RESOURCES ON OUR COMPLIANCE POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES, NON-COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS, CONFLICTS OF INTEREST REQUIREMENTS OR FIDUCIARY PRINCIPLES, OR OUR INABILITY TO KEEP UP WITH, OR ADAPT TO, AN EVER CHANGING, COMPLEX REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, COULD RESULT IN CIVIL LIABILITY, CRIMINAL LIABILITY AND/OR SANCTIONS AGAINST US, INCLUDING FINES AND CENSURES, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION FROM A PARTICULAR JURISDICTION OR MARKET OR THE REVOCATION OF LICENSES OR CHARTERS, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION, PROSPECTS, REVENUES AND INCOME. MOREOVER, ANY POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING OR REPORTING ERROR, WHETHER FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE, IF MATERIAL, COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.  THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2010 (THE \u201cDODD-FRANK ACT\u201d) AUTHORIZED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL (\u201cFSOC\u201d), THE MANDATE OF WHICH IS TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO THREATS TO U.S. FINANCIAL STABILITY. SIMILARLY, THE U.S. AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE G-20 GROUP OF NATIONS HAVE EMPOWERED THE FINANCIAL STABILITY BOARD (\u201cFSB\u201d) TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND, IN A COORDINATED MANNER, TO THREATS TO GLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY. THE FSOC MAY DESIGNATE CERTAIN NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES AS SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (\u201cSIFIS\u201d), WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND REGULATION BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. THE FSB MAY DESIGNATE CERTAIN NON-BANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES AS GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (\u201cG-SIFIS\u201d); THE ADDITIONAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TRIGGERED BY ANY SUCH DESIGNATION ARE NOT YET ESTABLISHED. THE FSOC AND THE FSB, AS WELL AS OTHER GLOBAL REGULATORS INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, ARE CONSIDERING WHAT THREATS TO U.S., EU AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL STABILITY, IF ANY, ARISE FROM ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANIES AND/OR THE FUNDS THAT THEY SPONSOR OR MANAGE, AND WHETHER SUCH THREATS CAN BE MITIGATED BY TREATING SUCH ENTITIES AS SIFIS OR G-SIFIS AND/OR SUBJECTING THEM TO ADDITIONAL REGULATION. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE OR ANY OF OUR FUNDS ARE DESIGNATED AS A SIFI OR G-SIFI, SUCH REGULATION, WHICH COULD INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO RISK-BASED CAPITAL, LEVERAGE, LIQUIDITY, CREDIT EXPOSURE, STRESS TESTING, RESOLUTION PLANS, EARLY REMEDIATION, AND CERTAIN RISK MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS, COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. THE DODD-FRANK ACT, AS WELL AS OTHER LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CHANGES, IMPOSE OTHER RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON US, RESULTING IN INCREASED SCRUTINY AND OVERSIGHT OF OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT AS IMPLEMENTING RULES ARE ADOPTED AND BECOME EFFECTIVE. UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, WHICH IMPOSES A NUMBER OF REGULATIONS GOVERNING DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF SWAPS ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED, AND FURTHER CATEGORIES OF SWAPS ARE LIKELY TO BE REQUIRED, TO BE SUBMITTED FOR CLEARING BY A REGULATED CLEARING ORGANIZATION AND REPORTED ON A SWAP EXECUTION FACILITY. THE EU AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS, AND THERE IS SOME RISK THAT FULL MUTUAL RECOGNITION MAY NOT BE ACHIEVED BETWEEN THE VARIOUS REGIMES, AND DUPLICATION OF REGULATION AND TRANSACTION COSTS MAY RESULT. THESE AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE LIKELY TO IMPACT HOW WE MANAGE OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES BECAUSE OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN INCREASE IN THE COSTS AND EXPENSES OF UTILIZING SWAPS AND OTHER DERIVATIVES. IN ADDITION, THE SEC HAS ADOPTED RULES THAT HAVE CHANGED THE STRUCTURE AND OPERATION FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS, AND THAT WILL REQUIRE CERTAIN REGISTERED FUNDS TO ADOPT LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. (COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE LATTER WAS REQUIRED BY DECEMBER 1, 2018, AND OTHER ASPECTS ARE DELAYED UNTIL JUNE 1, 2019, SUBJECT TO FURTHER REGULATORY UPDATE.) THE SEC HAS ALSO PROPOSED A RULE THAT WOULD IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF DERIVATIVES BY REGISTERED FUNDS. WE EXPECT THAT THE COMPLEX REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS APPLICABLE TO US WILL CAUSE US TO INCUR ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE AND COMPLIANCE COSTS.  THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESS GENERALLY INVOLVE RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH A VARIETY OF TECHNICAL, SPECIALIZED, AND EXPANDING MATTERS AND CONCERNS. FOR EXAMPLE, COMPLIANCE WITH THE BANK SECRECY ACT OF 1970, ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND ECONOMIC, TRADE AND OTHER SANCTIONS, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, HAS TAKEN ON HEIGHTENED IMPORTANCE AS A RESULT OF EFFORTS TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LIMIT TERRORISM AND ACTIONS THAT UNDERMINE THE STABILITY, SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF COUNTRIES. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED REGULATION WITH RESPECT TO THE PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER PRIVACY AND THE NEED TO SECURE SENSITIVE CUSTOMER INFORMATION. AS WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THESE REQUIREMENTS OR FOCUS ON MEETING NEW OR EXPANDED ONES, WE MAY EXPEND A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME AND RESOURCES. ANY INABILITY TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIMEFRAMES MAY SUBJECT US TO SANCTIONS OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS BY GOVERNMENTS AND/OR REGULATORS THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BROADER BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.  GLOBAL REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS AND REFORMS HAVE MADE THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE MORE COSTLY AND FUTURE ACTIONS AND REFORMS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED SUBSTANTIALLY AND MADE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COMPLEX BY, AMONG OTHER MEASURES, THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 AND THE USA PATRIOT ACT OF 2001. SIMILARLY, THE SECURITIES AND RELATED LAWS OUTSIDE THE U.S. HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED SUBSTANTIALLY AND MADE MORE COMPLEX BY MEASURES SUCH AS THE EU\u2019S ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT FUND MANAGERS DIRECTIVE (\u201cAIFMD\u201d) AND MARKETS IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DIRECTIVE II (\u201cMIFID II\u201d). ALTHOUGH NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE U.K. AND EU REGARDING THE U.K.\u2019S PROPOSED WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EU (\u201cBREXIT\u201d) BEGAN IN JUNE 2017, IT IS STILL UNCLEAR WHAT TERMS MAY BE AGREED TO IN THE FINAL OUTCOME AND FOR ANY TRANSITIONAL PERIOD. ONGOING CHANGES IN THE EU\u2019S REGULATORY FRAMEWORK APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CHANGES RELATED TO BREXIT AND ANY OTHER CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE EU\u2019S MEMBER STATES, MAY ADD FURTHER COMPLEXITY TO OUR GLOBAL RISKS AND OPERATIONS. MOREOVER, THE ADOPTION OF NEW LAWS, REGULATIONS OR STANDARDS  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AND CHANGES IN THE INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS, REGULATIONS OR STANDARDS HAVE DIRECTLY AFFECTED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT, OUR BUSINESS. WITH NEW LAWS AND CHANGES IN INTERPRETATION OF EXISTING REQUIREMENTS, THE ASSOCIATED TIME WE MUST DEDICATE TO AND RELATED COSTS WE MUST INCUR IN MEETING THE REGULATORY COMPLEXITIES OF OUR BUSINESS HAVE INCREASED. IN PARTICULAR, CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND MIFID II STILL REQUIRE THE ADOPTION OF IMPLEMENTING RULES. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL MANAGEMENT TIME AND RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE NEW REGULATIONS BEING ADOPTED PURSUANT TO THE DODD-FRANK ACT, MIFID II AND OTHER LAWS. FOR EXAMPLE, MIFID II REQUIRES THE \u201cUNBUNDLING\u201d OF RESEARCH AND EXECUTION CHARGES FOR TRADING. THE INDUSTRY\u2019S RESPONSE TO THE UNBUNDLING RULES IS STILL EVOLVING AND COULD LEAD TO INCREASED RESEARCH COSTS. OUTLAYS ASSOCIATED WITH MEETING REGULATORY COMPLEXITIES HAVE ALSO INCREASED AS WE EXPAND OUR BUSINESS INTO NEW JURISDICTIONS.  AS OF MAY 2018, THE EU\u2019S GDPR STRENGTHENED AND UNIFIED DATA PROTECTION RULES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE EU. THE GDPR ALSO ADDRESSES EXPORT OF PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE THE EU. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THE GDPR ARE TO GIVE CITIZENS CONTROL OF THEIR PERSONAL DATA AND TO SIMPLIFY THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS BY UNIFYING DATA PROTECTION REGULATION WITHIN THE EU. COMPLIANCE WITH THE STRINGENT DATA PROTECTION RULES UNDER THE GDPR REQUIRES AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW OF ALL OF OUR GLOBAL DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS. THE FAILURE TO COMPLY PROPERLY WITH GDPR RULES ON A TIMELY BASIS AND TO MAINTAIN ONGOING COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH RULES MAY SUBJECT US TO ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS AND SIGNIFICANT FINES AND COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE, A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE GDPR COULD RESULT IN FINES UP TO 20 MILLION EUROS OR 4% OF OUR ANNUAL GLOBAL REVENUES, WHICHEVER IS HIGHER.  FURTHER, PURSUANT TO ONGOING EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE GLOBAL TAX COMPLIANCE, THE ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT HAS ADOPTED A GLOBAL COMMON REPORTING STANDARD FOR THE AUTOMATIC EXCHANGE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION AMONG PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES (\u201cCRS\u201d), AIMED AT ENSURING THAT PERSONS WITH FINANCIAL ASSETS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THEIR TAX RESIDENCE COUNTRY PAY REQUIRED TAXES. IN MANY CASES, INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTICIPATING COUNTRIES WILL GOVERN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW CRS RULES. CRS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED OVER A MULTI-YEAR PERIOD AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS AND CORRESPONDING INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENTS TO DETERMINE OUR REQUIREMENTS. CRS MAY SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL REPORTING, COMPLIANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND BURDENS IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE OPERATE AS A QUALIFYING FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.  COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES TO ADDRESS THESE AND OTHER NEW LEGAL REQUIREMENTS HAVE REQUIRED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE, US TO EXPEND ADDITIONAL TIME AND RESOURCES, AND, CONSEQUENTLY, WE ARE INCURRING INCREASED COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS, WHICH POTENTIALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTS OUR PROFITABILITY AND FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS. FINALLY, ANY FURTHER REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS AND REFORMS AFFECTING THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE INITIATIVES, MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT REVENUES BY INCREASING OUR COSTS OF ACCESSING OR OPERATING IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS OR BY MAKING CERTAIN INVESTMENT OFFERINGS LESS FAVORABLE TO OUR CLIENTS.  FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS IN ANY OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL HARM TO OUR REPUTATION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  AS WITH ALL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, OUR ACTIVITIES ARE HIGHLY REGULATED IN ALMOST ALL COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS OF THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, OR WHERE OUR PRODUCTS ARE ORGANIZED OR SOLD, ARE COMPLEX, UNCERTAIN AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE. LOCAL REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS MAY VARY WIDELY AND PLACE ADDITIONAL DEMANDS ON OUR SALES, INVESTMENT, LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE PERSONNEL. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES, REGULATIONS, CODES, DIRECTIVES, NOTICES OR GUIDELINES IN ANY OF OUR JURISDICTIONS COULD RESULT IN A WIDE RANGE OF PENALTIES AND DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS, INCLUDING FINES, CENSURES AND THE SUSPENSION OR EXPULSION FROM A PARTICULAR JURISDICTION OR MARKET OR THE REVOCATION OF LICENSES, ANY OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION AND OPERATIONS. IN RECENT YEARS, THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASED AND EVOLVING REGULATIONS, WHICH HAVE IMPOSED AND MAY CONTINUE TO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND COSTS ON US IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTIONS. REGULATORS COULD ALSO CHANGE THEIR POLICIES OR LAWS IN A MANNER THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR OTHERWISE IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO OFFER OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS, OR WE MAY BE UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH, OR ADAPT TO, THE EVER CHANGING, COMPLEX REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS OR MARKETS, WHICH COULD FURTHER NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS.  CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR EXPOSURE TO ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX LIABILITIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIQUIDITY.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES AS WELL AS NON-INCOME BASED TAXES, AND ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING TAX AUDITS, IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. TAX AUTHORITIES MAY DISAGREE WITH CERTAIN POSITIONS WE HAVE TAKEN AND ASSESS ADDITIONAL TAXES. WE REGULARLY ASSESS THE LIKELY OUTCOMES OF THESE AUDITS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF OUR TAX PROVISION. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ACCURATELY PREDICT THE OUTCOMES OF THESE AUDITS, AND THE ACTUAL OUTCOMES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR NET INCOME OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR TAX RULINGS MAY AT TIMES MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ENACTED INTO LAW IN THE U.S. IN DECEMBER 2017 INCLUDES VARIOUS CHANGES TO THE TAX LAW, INCLUDING A PERMANENT REDUCTION IN THE CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE AND ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON CERTAIN NON-U.S. EARNINGS.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ANY SIGNIFICANT LIMITATION, FAILURE OR SECURITY BREACH OF OUR INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE, SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER SYSTEMS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO OUR OPERATIONS COULD DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS AND HARM OUR OPERATIONS AND REPUTATION.  WE ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE USE OF VARIOUS PROPRIETARY AND THIRD-PARTY INFORMATION AND SECURITY TECHNOLOGY, SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE CONTINUITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE, MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT AND REPORTING FRAMEWORK, POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CAPABILITIES TO PROTECT OUR COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS AND THE DATA THAT RESIDE ON OR ARE TRANSMITTED THROUGH THEM AND CONTRACTED THIRD-PARTY SYSTEMS. WE USE TECHNOLOGY ON A DAILY BASIS IN OUR BUSINESS TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND OPERATIONS, PROCESS AND TRANSMIT CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS, STORE AND MAINTAIN DATA, OBTAIN SECURITIES PRICING INFORMATION, PROCESS CLIENT TRANSACTIONS, AND PROVIDE REPORTS AND OTHER CUSTOMER SERVICES TO OUR CLIENTS. ANY DISRUPTIONS, INACCURACIES, DELAYS, SYSTEMS FAILURES, DATA OR PRIVACY BREACHES, OR CYBER OR OTHER SECURITY BREACHES IN THESE AND OTHER PROCESSES COULD SUBJECT US TO SIGNIFICANT CLIENT DISSATISFACTION AND LOSSES AND DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION. ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PROTECTIVE MEASURES, INCLUDING MEASURES TO SECURE AND PROTECT INFORMATION THROUGH SYSTEM SECURITY TECHNOLOGY AND OUR INTERNAL SECURITY PROCEDURES, THE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS WE USE REMAIN VULNERABLE TO UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, COMPUTER VIRUSES, POTENTIAL HUMAN ERRORS OR OTHER EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAVE A SECURITY IMPACT, SUCH AS AN EXTERNAL OR INTERNAL HACKER ATTACK BY ONE OR MORE CYBER CRIMINALS (INCLUDING THROUGH THE USE OF PHISHING ATTACKS, MALWARE, RANSOMWARE AND OTHER METHODS AND ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO MALICIOUSLY OBTAIN AND EXPLOIT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND TO OTHERWISE CAUSE DAMAGE) OR AN AUTHORIZED EMPLOYEE OR VENDOR INADVERTENTLY OR RECKLESSLY CAUSING US TO RELEASE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY HARM OUR OPERATIONS AND REPUTATION.  POTENTIAL SYSTEM DISRUPTIONS, FAILURES OR BREACHES OF THE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS WE USE OR THE SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE WE RELY UPON, AND THE COSTS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THEM, COULD RESULT IN: SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSS OR COSTS; THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR MODIFICATION OF SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL CLIENT AND BUSINESS INFORMATION; LOSS OF VALUABLE INFORMATION; BREACH OF CLIENT AND VENDOR CONTRACTS; LIABILITY FOR STOLEN ASSETS, INFORMATION OR IDENTITY; REMEDIATION COSTS TO REPAIR DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OR BREACH; ADDITIONAL SECURITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL COSTS TO MITIGATE AGAINST FUTURE INCIDENTS; REPUTATIONAL HARM; LOSS OF CONFIDENCE IN OUR BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS; LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO PROPERLY AND TIMELY REVIEW AND DISCLOSE APPLICABLE INCIDENTS OR PROVIDE RELEVANT UPDATED DISCLOSURE; REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS OR ACTIONS; AND/OR LEGAL CLAIMS, LIABILITY AND LITIGATION COSTS RESULTING FROM THE INCIDENT. MOREOVER, LOSS OR UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR TRANSFER OF CONFIDENTIAL CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION COULD FURTHER HARM OUR REPUTATION AND SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY UNDER LAWS THAT PROTECT CONFIDENTIAL PERSONAL DATA, RESULTING IN INCREASED COSTS OR A DECLINE IN OUR REVENUES OR COMMON STOCK PRICE. FURTHER, ALTHOUGH WE TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO PASSWORD PROTECT AND ENCRYPT OUR LAPTOPS AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION ON OUR OTHER MOBILE ELECTRONIC DEVICES, IF SUCH DEVICES ARE STOLEN, MISPLACED OR LEFT UNATTENDED, THEY MAY BECOME VULNERABLE TO HACKING OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED USE, CREATING A POSSIBLE SECURITY RISK AND RESULTING IN POTENTIALLY COSTLY ACTIONS BY US.  IN ADDITION, DUE TO OUR INTERCONNECTIVITY WITH THIRD-PARTY VENDORS, ADVISORS, CENTRAL AGENTS, EXCHANGES, CLEARING ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ANY OF THEM ARE SUBJECT TO A SUCCESSFUL CYBER ATTACK OR OTHER INFORMATION SECURITY EVENT, INCLUDING THOSE ARISING DUE TO THE USE OF MOBILE TECHNOLOGY OR A THIRD-PARTY CLOUD ENVIRONMENT. MOST OF THE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS THAT WE USE IN OUR BUSINESS ARE LICENSED FROM, AND SUPPORTED, UPGRADED AND MAINTAINED BY, THIRD-PARTY VENDORS. OUR THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS INCLUDE ENTERPRISE CLOUD STORAGE AND CLOUD COMPUTING APPLICATION SERVICES PROVIDED AND MAINTAINED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS. A SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF CERTAIN OF THESE LICENSES OR THE RELATED SUPPORT, UPGRADES AND MAINTENANCE COULD CAUSE TEMPORARY SYSTEM DELAYS OR INTERRUPTION THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. ALSO, OUR THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS MAY INCLUDE CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY DATA PROVIDED BY VENDORS AND BY US. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION COSTS AND LIABILITY TO THIRD PARTIES IF WE BREACH ANY CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS REGARDING VENDOR DATA, FOR LOSSES RELATED TO THE DATA, OR IF DATA WE PROVIDE IS DEEMED TO INFRINGE UPON THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS. IN ADDITION, THE FAILURE TO PROPERLY MANAGE AND OPERATE THE DATA CENTERS WE USE COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE IN PLACE CERTAIN DISASTER RECOVERY PLANS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE SYSTEM DELAYS AND INTERRUPTIONS AS A RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTERS, POWER FAILURES, ACTS OF WAR, AND THIRD-PARTY FAILURES. TECHNOLOGY IS SUBJECT TO RAPID ADVANCEMENTS AND CHANGES AND OUR COMPETITORS MAY FROM TIME TO TIME IMPLEMENT NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR MORE ADVANCED PLATFORMS FOR THEIR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING DIGITAL ADVISERS AND OTHER ADVANCED ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE.  OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE COMPLEX AND A FAILURE TO PROPERLY PERFORM OPERATIONAL TASKS OR THE MISREPRESENTATION OF OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, OR THE TERMINATION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR AUM, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND INCOME.  THROUGH OUR SUBSIDIARIES, WE PROVIDE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SERVICES TO INVESTORS GLOBALLY THROUGH OUR PRODUCTS. IN ORDER TO BE COMPETITIVE AND COMPLY WITH OUR AGREEMENTS, WE MUST PROPERLY PERFORM OUR FUND AND PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION AND RELATED RESPONSIBILITIES, INCLUDING PORTFOLIO RECORDKEEPING AND ACCOUNTING, SECURITY PRICING, CORPORATE ACTIONS, INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS COMPLIANCE, DAILY NET ASSET VALUE COMPUTATIONS, ACCOUNT RECONCILIATIONS, AND REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS TO FUND SHAREHOLDERS. MANY OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE COMPLEX AND DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY PROCESS AND MONITOR A LARGE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS, MANY OF WHICH MAY OCCUR ACROSS NUMEROUS MARKETS AND CURRENCIES AT HIGH VOLUMES AND FREQUENCIES. ALTHOUGH WE EXPEND CONSIDERABLE RESOURCES ON INTERNAL CONTROLS, SUPERVISION, TECHNOLOGY AND TRAINING IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS DO NOT VIOLATE APPLICABLE GUIDELINES, RULES AND REGULATIONS OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CLIENTS, COUNTERPARTIES OR US, OUR OPERATIONS ARE ULTIMATELY DEPENDENT ON OUR EMPLOYEES AND SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL HUMAN ERRORS.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS INVOLVED IN OUR BUSINESS MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, MAKE MISTAKES THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS IMMEDIATELY DETECTED, WHICH MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS, CAUSE LOSSES, LEAD TO REGULATORY FINES OR SANCTIONS, OR OTHERWISE DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION. IN ADDITION, ANY MISREPRESENTATION OF OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS IN ADVERTISING MATERIALS, PUBLIC RELATIONS INFORMATION, SOCIAL MEDIA OR OTHER EXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS. OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES, WHICH REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES, ARE DEPENDENT ON FEES EARNED UNDER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR PRODUCTS. OUR REVENUES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF SUCH AGREEMENTS REPRESENTING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR AUM ARE TERMINATED OR SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED. FURTHER, CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES MAY ACT AS GENERAL PARTNER FOR VARIOUS INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS, WHICH MAY SUBJECT THEM TO LIABILITY FOR THE PARTNERSHIPS\u2019 LIABILITIES. IF WE FAIL TO PROPERLY PERFORM AND MONITOR OUR OPERATIONS, OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER AND OUR REVENUES AND INCOME COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  WE FACE RISKS, AND CORRESPONDING POTENTIAL COSTS AND EXPENSES, ASSOCIATED WITH CONDUCTING OPERATIONS AND GROWING OUR BUSINESS IN NUMEROUS COUNTRIES.  WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS SUCH AS OUR FUNDS AND STRATEGIES, AND OFFER OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND RELATED SERVICES, IN MANY DIFFERENT REGULATORY JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS INTERNATIONALLY. AS WE DO SO, WE WILL CONTINUE TO FACE CHALLENGES TO THE ADEQUACY OF OUR RESOURCES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS TO CONSISTENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, WE MUST BE PROACTIVE AND PREPARED TO IMPLEMENT NECESSARY RESOURCES WHEN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES PRESENT THEMSELVES, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF A BUSINESS ACQUISITION OR RAPIDLY INCREASING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN PARTICULAR MARKETS OR REGIONS. LOCAL REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS MAY VARY WIDELY IN TERMS OF SCOPE, ADEQUACY AND SOPHISTICATION. SIMILARLY, LOCAL DISTRIBUTORS, AND THEIR POLICIES AND PRACTICES AS WELL AS FINANCIAL VIABILITY, MAY ALSO VARY WIDELY, OR BE INCONSISTENT OR LESS DEVELOPED OR MATURE THAN OTHER MORE INTERNATIONALLY FOCUSED DISTRIBUTORS. NOTWITHSTANDING POTENTIAL LONG-TERM COST SAVINGS BY INCREASING CERTAIN OPERATIONS, SUCH AS TRANSFER AGENT AND OTHER BACK-OFFICE OPERATIONS, IN COUNTRIES OR REGIONS OF THE WORLD WITH LOWER OPERATING COSTS, GROWTH OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS MAY INVOLVE NEAR-TERM INCREASES IN EXPENSES AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL CAPITAL COSTS, SUCH AS INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND COSTS RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH PARTICULAR REGULATORY OR OTHER LOCAL REQUIREMENTS OR NEEDS. LOCAL REQUIREMENTS OR NEEDS MAY ALSO PLACE ADDITIONAL DEMANDS ON SALES AND COMPLIANCE PERSONNEL AND RESOURCES, SUCH AS MEETING LOCAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS, WHILE ALSO INTEGRATING PERSONNEL INTO AN ORGANIZATION WITH A SINGLE OPERATING LANGUAGE. FINDING, HIRING AND RETAINING ADDITIONAL, WELL-QUALIFIED PERSONNEL AND CRAFTING AND ADOPTING POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND CONTROLS TO ADDRESS LOCAL OR REGIONAL REQUIREMENTS REMAIN A CHALLENGE AS WE EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS INTERNATIONALLY. MOREOVER, REGULATORS IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS COULD ALSO CHANGE THEIR POLICIES OR LAWS IN A MANNER THAT MIGHT RESTRICT OR OTHERWISE IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE OR AUTHORIZE PRODUCTS OR MAINTAIN THEIR AUTHORIZATIONS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKETS. ANY OF THESE LOCAL REQUIREMENTS, ACTIVITIES, OR NEEDS COULD INCREASE THE COSTS AND EXPENSES WE INCUR IN A SPECIFIC JURISDICTION WITHOUT ANY CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN REVENUES AND INCOME FROM OPERATING IN THE JURISDICTION. CERTAIN LAWS AND REGULATIONS BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE U.S. HAVE INCLUDED EXTRATERRITORIAL APPLICATION. THIS MAY LEAD TO DUPLICATIVE OR CONFLICTING LEGAL OR REGULATORY BURDENS AND ADDITIONAL COSTS AND RISKS. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME WE ENTER INTO JOINT VENTURES OR TAKE MINORITY STAKES IN COMPANIES IN WHICH WE TYPICALLY DO NOT HAVE CONTROL. THESE INVESTMENTS MAY INVOLVE RISKS, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLLING STAKEHOLDER OR OUR JOINT VENTURE PARTNER MAY HAVE BUSINESS INTERESTS, STRATEGIES OR GOALS THAT ARE INCONSISTENT WITH OURS, AND THE RISK THAT BUSINESS DECISIONS OR OTHER ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF THE CONTROLLING STAKEHOLDER, OUR JOINT VENTURE PARTNER OR THE ENTITY ITSELF MAY RESULT IN LIABILITY FOR US OR HARM TO OUR REPUTATION OR ADVERSELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ENTITY.  WE DEPEND ON KEY PERSONNEL AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE LOSS OF THEIR SERVICES.  THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO DEPEND UPON OUR KEY PERSONNEL, INCLUDING OUR PORTFOLIO AND FUND MANAGERS, INVESTMENT ANALYSTS, INVESTMENT ADVISERS, SALES AND MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS AS WELL AS OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND BUSINESS UNIT HEADS. COMPETITION FOR QUALIFIED, MOTIVATED, AND HIGHLY SKILLED EXECUTIVES, PROFESSIONALS AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL IN THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY REMAINS SIGNIFICANT. OUR SUCCESS DEPENDS TO A SUBSTANTIAL DEGREE UPON OUR ABILITY TO FIND, ATTRACT, RETAIN AND MOTIVATE QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING THROUGH COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION PACKAGES, AND UPON THE CONTINUED CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE PEOPLE. LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE CONTAINED IN OR RELATING TO THE EU\u2019S CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DIRECTIVE, THOSE ADOPTED UNDER AIFMD AND UCITS AND THOSE REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT, COULD IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON COMPENSATION PAID BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WHICH COULD RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY FOR QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS. AS OUR BUSINESS DEVELOPS, WE ARE LIKELY TO NEED TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WE EMPLOY. MOREOVER, IN ORDER TO RETAIN CERTAIN KEY PERSONNEL, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INCREASE COMPENSATION TO SUCH INDIVIDUALS, RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN POTENTIAL REVENUES. IN ADDITION, DUE TO THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, OUR KEY PERSONNEL MAY FROM TIME TO TIME HAVE REASONS TO TRAVEL TO REGIONS SUSCEPTIBLE TO HIGHER RISK OF CIVIL UNREST, ORGANIZED CRIME OR TERRORISM, AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF OUR PERSONNEL TRAVELING TO SUCH REGIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING, ATTRACTING AND RETAINING QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS, AND THE DEPARTURE OF KEY INVESTMENT PERSONNEL, IN PARTICULAR, IF NOT REPLACED, COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE CLIENTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS.  STRONG COMPETITION FROM NUMEROUS AND SOMETIMES LARGER COMPANIES WITH COMPETING OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS COULD LIMIT OR REDUCE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN A DECLINE IN OUR MARKET SHARE, REVENUES AND INCOME.  WE COMPETE WITH NUMEROUS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, SECURITIES BROKERAGE AND INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS, INSURANCE COMPANIES, BANKS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. OUR PRODUCTS ALSO COMPETE WITH PRODUCTS OFFERED BY THESE COMPETITORS, AS WELL AS WITH REAL ESTATE  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVESTMENT TRUSTS, HEDGE FUNDS AND OTHER PRODUCTS. THE PERIODIC ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANIES AND OTHER COMPETITORS INCREASES THE COMPETITION THAT WE FACE. AT THE SAME TIME, CONSOLIDATION IN THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS CREATED STRONGER COMPETITORS WITH GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND BROADER DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THAN OUR OWN. COMPETITION IS BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, BUSINESS REPUTATION, INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, PRODUCT MIX AND OFFERINGS, SERVICE QUALITY AND INNOVATION, DISTRIBUTION RELATIONSHIPS, AND FEES CHARGED. FURTHER, ALTHOUGH WE MAY OFFER CERTAIN TYPES OF EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS, TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A TREND AMONG EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CLIENTS IN FAVOR OF LOWER FEE INDEX AND OTHER EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS, IT MAY FAVOR OUR COMPETITORS WHO MAY OFFER SUCH PRODUCTS THAT ARE MORE ESTABLISHED OR ON A LARGER SCALE THAN WE DO. ADDITIONALLY, COMPETING SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS, WHOM WE RELY UPON TO DISTRIBUTE AND SELL CERTAIN OF OUR FUNDS AND OTHER PRODUCTS, MAY ALSO SELL THEIR OWN PROPRIETARY FUNDS AND PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD LIMIT THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT THAT EXISTING OR POTENTIAL CLIENTS, INCLUDING SECURITIES BROKER-DEALERS, DECIDE TO INVEST IN OR DISTRIBUTE THE PRODUCTS OF OUR COMPETITORS, THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AS WELL AS OUR MARKET SHARE, REVENUES AND INCOME COULD DECLINE. OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN AUM IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE RELATIVE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, OFFERING A MIX OF PRODUCTS AND STRATEGIES THAT MEETS INVESTOR DEMANDS, AND OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEES AND PRICING STRUCTURE AT COMPETITIVE LEVELS.  CHANGES IN THE THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTION AND SALES CHANNELS ON WHICH WE DEPEND COULD REDUCE OUR INCOME AND HINDER OUR GROWTH.  WE DERIVE NEARLY ALL OF OUR FUND SALES THROUGH THIRD-PARTY BROKER-DEALERS, BANKS, INVESTMENT ADVISERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES. INCREASING COMPETITION FOR THESE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES HAVE CAUSED OUR DISTRIBUTION COSTS TO RISE AND COULD CAUSE FURTHER INCREASES IN THE FUTURE OR COULD OTHERWISE NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS. THE SEC HAS PROPOSED CHANGES TO RULE 12B-1 PROMULGATED UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT WHICH, IF ADOPTED, COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER EXPENSES RELATING TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR U.S.-REGISTERED FUNDS. HIGHER DISTRIBUTION COSTS LOWER OUR INCOME; CONSOLIDATIONS IN THE BROKER-DEALER INDUSTRY COULD ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR INCOME. MOREOVER, IF SEVERAL OF THE MAJOR FINANCIAL ADVISERS WHO DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS WERE TO CEASE OPERATIONS OR LIMIT OR OTHERWISE END THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS, IT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR INCOME. PURSUANT TO THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE SEC MAY ESTABLISH DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR BROKER-DEALERS IN THEIR INTERACTION WITH RETAIL CUSTOMERS, WHICH COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON SALES AND/OR DISTRIBUTION COSTS. IN APRIL 2018, THE SEC PROPOSED RULES THAT WOULD APPLY TO ALL RETAIL INVESTORS AND WOULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS: REQUIRE BROKER-DEALERS TO ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THEIR RETAIL CUSTOMERS WHEN RECOMMENDING SECURITIES AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE SCOPE AND TERMS OF THE RELATIONSHIP; CLARIFY THE FIDUCIARY DUTY THAT AN INVESTMENT ADVISER OWES TO ITS CLIENTS; AND REQUIRE A NEW SHORT-FORM DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT TO INFORM CLIENTS OF THE NATURE OF THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS, INCLUDING DIFFERENCES IN THE PRINCIPAL TYPES OF SERVICES OFFERED, THE LEGAL STANDARDS OF CONDUCT THAT APPLY TO EACH, THE FEES A CLIENT MIGHT PAY, AND CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAT MAY EXIST. IN ADDITION, THE U.K., THE NETHERLANDS AND THE EU IN MIFID II HAVE ADOPTED REGIMES WHICH BAN, OR MAY LIMIT, THE PAYMENT OF COMMISSIONS AND OTHER INDUCEMENTS TO INTERMEDIARIES IN RELATION TO CERTAIN SALES TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS, AND SIMILAR REGIMES ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION IN SEVERAL OTHER JURISDICTIONS. DEPENDING ON THEIR EXACT TERMS, SUCH REGIMES MAY RESULT IN EXISTING FLOWS OF BUSINESS MOVING TO LESS PROFITABLE CHANNELS OR EVEN TO COMPETITORS PROVIDING SUBSTITUTABLE PRODUCTS OUTSIDE THE REGIME. ARRANGEMENTS WITH NON-INDEPENDENT ADVISERS WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED AS NARROWER RULES RELATED TO THE REQUIREMENT THAT COMMISSIONS REFLECT AN ENHANCEMENT OF THE SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS COME INTO EFFECT, ALONG WITH A PRESCRIPTIVE LIST OF PERMISSIBLE NON-MONETARY BENEFITS. THE INTERPRETATION OF THE INDUCEMENTS RULES HAS ALSO RESULTED IN MAJOR CHANGES TO HOW FUND MANAGERS FINANCE INVESTMENT RESEARCH WITH MANY FIRMS, INCLUDING OURS, OPTING TO PAY FOR THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENT RESEARCH FOR CLIENT ACCOUNTS COVERED BY MIFID II. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE THIRD-PARTY BROKER-DEALERS, BANKS, INVESTMENT ADVISERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES THAT CURRENTLY DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS, OR CONTINUE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER ALL OR SOME OF OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS THROUGH THEM. A FAILURE TO MAINTAIN STRONG BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUCH DISTRIBUTORS MAY ALSO IMPAIR OUR DISTRIBUTION AND SALES OPERATIONS. BECAUSE WE USE BROKER-DEALERS, BANKS, INVESTMENT ADVISERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS, WE DO NOT CONTROL THE ULTIMATE INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATIONS GIVEN TO CLIENTS. ANY INABILITY TO ACCESS AND SUCCESSFULLY SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO CLIENTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR LEVEL OF AUM, INCOME AND OVERALL BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  OUR INCREASING FOCUS ON INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AS A SOURCE OF INVESTMENTS AND SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS SUBJECTS US TO INCREASED EXCHANGE RATE AND MARKET-SPECIFIC POLITICAL, ECONOMIC OR OTHER RISKS THAT MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND INCOME GENERATED OVERSEAS.  WHILE WE MAINTAIN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., WE ALSO PROVIDE SERVICES AND EARN REVENUES IN EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA, ASIA-PACIFIC, CANADA, THE BAHAMAS AND LATIN AMERICA. AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK THROUGH OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EXCHANGE RATES TO THE U.S. DOLLAR HAVE AFFECTED AND MAY IN THE FUTURE AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM ONE PERIOD TO THE NEXT. WHILE WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO REDUCE OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK, FOR EXAMPLE, BY DENOMINATING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR TRANSACTIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS, THE SITUATION MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE AS OUR BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW OUTSIDE THE U.S. APPRECIATION OF THE U.S. DOLLAR HAS AND COULD IN THE FUTURE MODERATE REVENUES FROM MANAGING OUR PRODUCTS INTERNATIONALLY, OR COULD AFFECT RELATIVE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS INVESTED IN NON-U.S. SECURITIES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE REVALUATION OF U.S. DOLLAR BALANCES HELD BY CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES FOR WHICH THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. SEPARATELY, MANAGEMENT FEES THAT WE EARN TEND TO BE HIGHER IN CONNECTION WITH NON-U.S. AUM THAN WITH U.S. AUM. CONSEQUENTLY, DOWNTURNS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS HAVE IN THE PAST AND COULD IN THE FUTURE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND INCOME. MOREOVER, OUR EMERGING MARKET PORTFOLIOS AND REVENUES DERIVED FROM MANAGING THESE PORTFOLIOS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF LOSS FROM FINANCIAL,  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC DEVELOPMENTS, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, SOCIAL INSTABILITY, CHANGES IN GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES, EXPROPRIATION, NATIONALIZATION, ASSET CONFISCATION AND CHANGES IN LEGISLATION RELATED TO NON-U.S. OWNERSHIP. INTERNATIONAL TRADING MARKETS, PARTICULARLY IN SOME EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES, ARE OFTEN SMALLER, LESS LIQUID, LESS REGULATED AND SIGNIFICANTLY MORE VOLATILE THAN THOSE IN THE U.S. AS OUR BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW IN NON-U.S. MARKETS, ANY ONGOING AND FUTURE BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL OR SOCIAL UNREST AFFECTING THESE MARKETS, IN ADDITION TO ANY DIRECT CONSEQUENCES SUCH UNREST MAY HAVE ON OUR PERSONNEL AND FACILITIES LOCATED IN THE AFFECTED AREA, MAY ALSO HAVE A MORE LASTING IMPACT ON THE LONG-TERM INVESTMENT CLIMATE IN THESE AND OTHER AREAS AND, AS A RESULT, OUR AUM AND THE CORRESPONDING REVENUES AND INCOME THAT WE GENERATE FROM THEM MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.  HARM TO OUR REPUTATION OR POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE THE LEVEL OF OUR AUM OR AFFECT OUR SALES, AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND INCOME.  OUR REPUTATION IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR BRAND NAMES HAVE BEEN, AND CONTINUE TO BE, WELL RECEIVED BOTH IN OUR INDUSTRY AND WITH OUR CLIENTS, REFLECTING THE FACT THAT OUR BRANDS, LIKE OUR BUSINESS, ARE BASED IN PART ON TRUST AND CONFIDENCE. IF OUR REPUTATION IS HARMED, EXISTING CLIENTS MAY REDUCE AMOUNTS HELD IN, OR WITHDRAW ENTIRELY FROM, OUR PRODUCTS OR OUR PRODUCTS MAY TERMINATE THEIR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH US, WHICH COULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF OUR AUM AND CAUSE US TO SUFFER A CORRESPONDING LOSS IN OUR REVENUES AND INCOME. OUR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, ALONG WITH ACHIEVING AND MAINTAINING SUPERIOR DISTRIBUTION AND CLIENT SERVICE, IS ALSO CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS. STRONG INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OFTEN STIMULATES SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS. POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE AS COMPARED TO THIRD-PARTY BENCHMARKS OR COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS HAS IN THE PAST AND COULD IN THE FUTURE LEAD TO A DECREASE IN SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND STIMULATE REDEMPTIONS FROM EXISTING PRODUCTS, GENERALLY LOWERING THE OVERALL LEVEL OF AUM AND REDUCING THE MANAGEMENT FEES WE EARN. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT PAST OR PRESENT INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE IN OUR PRODUCTS WILL BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE. ANY POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND INCOME. REPUTATIONAL HARM OR POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE MAY CAUSE US TO LOSE CURRENT CLIENTS AND WE MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT NEW CLIENTS OR DEVELOP NEW BUSINESS. IF WE FAIL TO ADDRESS, OR APPEAR TO FAIL TO ADDRESS, SUCCESSFULLY AND PROMPTLY THE UNDERLYING CAUSES OF ANY REPUTATIONAL HARM OR POOR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, WE MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN REPAIRING ANY EXISTING HARM TO OUR REPUTATION OR PERFORMANCE AND OUR FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS WOULD LIKELY BE AFFECTED.  OUR FUTURE RESULTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON MAINTAINING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF EXPENSES, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION.  THE LEVEL OF OUR EXPENSES IS SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION AND MAY INCREASE FOR THE FOLLOWING OR OTHER REASONS: CHANGES IN THE LEVEL AND SCOPE OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES IN RESPONSE TO MARKET CONDITIONS OR REGULATIONS; VARIATIONS IN THE LEVEL OF TOTAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE DUE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BONUSES, MERIT INCREASES AND SEVERANCE COSTS, CHANGES IN OUR EMPLOYEE COUNT AND MIX, AND COMPETITIVE FACTORS; AND/OR CHANGES IN EXPENSES AND CAPITAL COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS INCURRED TO MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE OUR ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATING SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE OR TO COVER UNINSURED LOSSES, AND AN INCREASE IN INSURANCE EXPENSES INCLUDING THROUGH THE ASSUMPTION OF HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES AND/OR CO-INSURANCE LIABILITY.  OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE AND GROW OUR BUSINESS CAN BE IMPEDED BY SYSTEMS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS.  OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS IN EFFECTIVELY MANAGING AND GROWING OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO INTEGRATE THE VARIED ACCOUNTING, FINANCIAL, INFORMATION, AND OPERATIONAL SYSTEMS ON A GLOBAL BASIS. MOREOVER, ADAPTING OR DEVELOPING THE EXISTING TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS WE USE TO MEET OUR INTERNAL NEEDS, AS WELL AS CLIENT NEEDS, INDUSTRY DEMANDS AND NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, IS ALSO CRITICAL FOR OUR BUSINESS. THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES PRESENTS NEW CHALLENGES TO US. WE HAVE AN ONGOING NEED TO CONTINUALLY UPGRADE AND IMPROVE OUR VARIOUS TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING OUR DATA PROCESSING, FINANCIAL, ACCOUNTING, SHAREHOLDER SERVICING AND TRADING SYSTEMS. FURTHER, WE ALSO MUST BE PROACTIVE AND PREPARED TO IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS WHEN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES PRESENT THEMSELVES, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF A BUSINESS ACQUISITION OR RAPIDLY INCREASING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES IN PARTICULAR MARKETS OR REGIONS. THESE NEEDS COULD PRESENT OPERATIONAL ISSUES OR REQUIRE, FROM TIME TO TIME, SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL SPENDING. IT ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO REEVALUATE THE CURRENT VALUE AND/OR EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES OF THE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS WE USE, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

SHOULD WE EXPERIENCE A LOCAL OR REGIONAL DISASTER OR OTHER BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROBLEM, SUCH AS AN EARTHQUAKE, TSUNAMI, TERRORIST ATTACK, PANDEMIC OR OTHER NATURAL OR MAN-MADE DISASTER, OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE SAFETY AND AVAILABILITY OF OUR PERSONNEL, OUR OFFICE FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE PROPER FUNCTIONING OF OUR TECHNOLOGY, COMPUTER, TELECOMMUNICATION AND OTHER SYSTEMS AND OPERATIONS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS. WHILE OUR OPERATIONAL SIZE, THE DIVERSITY OF LOCATIONS FROM WHICH WE OPERATE, AND OUR VARIOUS BACK-UP SYSTEMS PROVIDE US WITH AN ADVANTAGE SHOULD WE EXPERIENCE A LOCAL OR REGIONAL DISASTER OR OTHER BUSINESS CONTINUITY EVENT, WE COULD STILL EXPERIENCE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES, IN PARTICULAR DEPENDING UPON HOW A LOCAL OR REGIONAL EVENT MAY AFFECT OUR HUMAN CAPITAL ACROSS OUR OPERATIONS OR WITH REGARD TO PARTICULAR ASPECTS OF OUR OPERATIONS, SUCH AS KEY EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OR PERSONNEL IN OUR TECHNOLOGY GROUP. MOREOVER, AS WE GROW OUR OPERATIONS IN NEW GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, THE POTENTIAL FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF NATURAL OR MAN-MADE DISASTERS; POLITICAL, ECONOMIC OR INFRASTRUCTURE INSTABILITIES; INFORMATION, TECHNOLOGY OR SECURITY LIMITATIONS OR BREACHES; OR OTHER COUNTRY- OR REGION-SPECIFIC BUSINESS CONTINUITY RISKS INCREASES. PAST DISASTER RECOVERY EFFORTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT EVEN SEEMINGLY LOCALIZED EVENTS MAY REQUIRE BROADER DISASTER RECOVERY EFFORTS THROUGHOUT OUR OPERATIONS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, WE REGULARLY ASSESS AND TAKE STEPS TO IMPROVE UPON OUR EXISTING BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS AND KEY MANAGEMENT SUCCESSION. HOWEVER,  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  A DISASTER ON A SIGNIFICANT SCALE OR AFFECTING CERTAIN OF OUR KEY OPERATING AREAS WITHIN OR ACROSS REGIONS, OR OUR INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RECOVER SHOULD WE EXPERIENCE A DISASTER OR OTHER BUSINESS CONTINUITY PROBLEM, COULD MATERIALLY INTERRUPT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND CAUSE MATERIAL FINANCIAL LOSS, LOSS OF HUMAN CAPITAL, REGULATORY ACTIONS, REPUTATIONAL HARM, OR LEGAL LIABILITY.  REGULATORY AND GOVERNMENTAL EXAMINATIONS AND/OR INVESTIGATIONS, LITIGATION AND THE LEGAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS, COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AUM, INCREASE COSTS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY AND/OR OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.  FROM TIME TO TIME WE RECEIVE AND RESPOND TO GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY REQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS OR OTHER INFORMATION, SUBPOENAS, EXAMINATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENTAL OR REGULATORY EXAMINATIONS OR INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN INACTIVE COULD BECOME ACTIVE. IN ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ARE NAMED AS A PARTY IN LITIGATION. WE MAY BE OBLIGATED, AND UNDER OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, BY-LAWS AND STANDARD FORM OF DIRECTOR INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT WE ARE OBLIGATED UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, OR WE MAY CHOOSE, TO INDEMNIFY DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES AGAINST LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES THEY MAY INCUR IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH MATTERS TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. EVEN IF CLAIMS MADE AGAINST US ARE WITHOUT MERIT, LITIGATION TYPICALLY IS AN EXPENSIVE PROCESS. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LEGAL LIABILITY OFTEN ARE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS OR QUANTIFY AND THEIR EXISTENCE AND MAGNITUDE CAN REMAIN UNKNOWN FOR SIGNIFICANT PERIODS OF TIME. EVENTUAL EXPOSURES FROM AND EXPENSES INCURRED RELATING TO ANY LITIGATION, INVESTIGATIONS, EXAMINATIONS AND SETTLEMENTS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR AUM, INCREASE COSTS AND/OR NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR PROFITABILITY AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR ABILITY TO MEET CASH NEEDS DEPENDS UPON CERTAIN FACTORS, INCLUDING THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR ASSETS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND OUR PERCEIVED CREDITWORTHINESS.  OUR ABILITY TO MEET ANTICIPATED CASH NEEDS DEPENDS UPON FACTORS SUCH AS THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR ASSETS, OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND OUR CREDITWORTHINESS AS PERCEIVED BY LENDERS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN CASH, FINANCING OR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS IN A TIMELY MANNER, WE MAY BE FORCED TO INCUR UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR REVISE OUR BUSINESS PLANS, AND OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. FURTHER, OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR CREDIT RATINGS. A REDUCTION IN OUR LONG- OR SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATINGS COULD INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS AND LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS. VOLATILITY IN THE GLOBAL FINANCING MARKETS MAY ALSO IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS SHOULD WE SEEK TO DO SO, AND MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON INVESTORS\u2019 WILLINGNESS TO PURCHASE OUR SECURITIES, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT SPREADS AND/OR THE VALUATION LEVELS OF EQUITY MARKETS.
