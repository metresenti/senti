AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE QUARTER MARCH 31, 2019  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FIRST QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  (CONTINUED)  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE BUILDING MATERIALS BUSINESS IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY WEATHER PATTERNS AND SEASONAL CHANGES.  PRODUCTION AND SHIPMENT LEVELS FOR AGGREGATES, CEMENT, READY MIXED CONCRETE AND ASPHALT AND PAVING MATERIALS CORRELATE WITH GENERAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY LEVELS, MOST OF WHICH OCCUR IN THE SPRING, SUMMER AND FALL.  THUS, PRODUCTION AND SHIPMENT LEVELS VARY BY QUARTER.  OPERATIONS CONCENTRATED IN THE NORTHERN AND MIDWESTERN UNITED STATES GENERALLY EXPERIENCE MORE SEVERE WINTER WEATHER CONDITIONS THAN OPERATIONS IN THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST. EXCESSIVE RAINFALL, AND CONVERSELY EXCESSIVE DROUGHT, CAN ALSO JEOPARDIZE PRODUCTION, SHIPMENTS AND PROFITABILITY IN ALL MARKETS SERVED BY THE COMPANY.  DUE TO THE POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF WEATHER ON THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS, CURRENT PERIOD AND YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF EXPECTED PERFORMANCE FOR OTHER INTERIM PERIODS OR THE FULL YEAR.  EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EBITDA) IS A WIDELY ACCEPTED FINANCIAL INDICATOR OF A COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO SERVICE AND/OR INCUR INDEBTEDNESS.  EBITDA IS NOT DEFINED BY GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND, AS SUCH, SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET EARNINGS, OPERATING EARNINGS OR OPERATING CASH FLOW.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT EBITDA MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE OR ABILITY TO MEET ITS FUTURE DEBT SERVICE, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  BECAUSE EBITDA EXCLUDES SOME, BUT NOT ALL, ITEMS THAT AFFECT NET EARNINGS AND MAY VARY AMONG COMPANIES, EBITDA AS PRESENTED BY THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES.

(  4  )  TOTAL AGGREGATES OPERATIONS INCLUDE ACQUISITIONS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURES THROUGH THE DATE OF DISPOSAL.  FIRST-QUARTER OPERATING RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE ROBUST UNDERLYING DEMAND THAT WAS MASKED IN 2018 BY WEATHER, CONTRACTOR CAPACITY AND LOGISTICS DISRUPTIONS. WHILE WINTER WEATHER TRADITIONALLY LIMITS THE ABILITY OF OUTDOOR CONTRACTORS TO PERFORM WORK, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED RELATIVELY BETTER WEATHER DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019. THIS ALLOWED CONTRACTORS TO BEGIN ADDRESSING BACKLOGS WITH AN EARLIER-THAN-NORMAL START TO THE CONSTRUCTION SEASON. THE NOTABLE EXCEPTION WAS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S SECOND-LARGEST STATE BY REVENUES, COLORADO, WHICH EXPERIENCED ONE OF ITS HARSHEST WINTERS ON RECORD, DELAYING THE ONSET OF MEANINGFUL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY.  AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE MARKET INCREASED 2% AS MODESTLY IMPROVED WEATHER, PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTHEAST, ALLOWED CONTRACTORS TO ADVANCE TRANSPORTATION-RELATED PROJECTS EARLIER IN THE CONSTRUCTION SEASON. FOLLOWING MORE THAN A DECADE OF UNDERINVESTMENT, MANAGEMENT REMAINS CONFIDENT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE DEMAND IS POISED FOR MEANINGFUL GROWTH. FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE FIXING AMERICA\u2019S SURFACE TRANSPORTATION ACT (FAST ACT), COMBINED WITH  PAGE 31 OF 44  MARTIN MARIETTA MATERIALS, INC.

FOR THE QUARTER, THE INFRASTRUCTURE MARKET REPRESENTED 33%  OF AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS, WHICH IS BELOW THE COMPANY\u2019S MOST RECENT TEN-YEAR AVERAGE OF 46%  BUT CONSISTENT WITH FIRST-QUARTER HISTORICAL TRENDS.  AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS TO THE NONRESIDENTIAL MARKET INCREASED 33%, DRIVEN BY BOTH COMMERCIAL AND HEAVY INDUSTRIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY.  THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO BENEFIT FROM ROBUST DISTRIBUTION CENTER, WAREHOUSE, DATA CENTER AND WIND TURBINE PROJECTS IN KEY GEOGRAPHIES, INCLUDING TEXAS, THE CAROLINAS, GEORGIA AND IOWA. THE NONRESIDENTIAL MARKET REPRESENTED 37% OF FIRST-QUARTER AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS.  AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS TO THE RESIDENTIAL MARKET INCREASED 8%, DRIVEN BY WEATHER-DEFERRED HOMEBUILDING ACTIVITY IN THE CAROLINAS, GEORGIA AND FLORIDA. DESPITE THE RECENT SLOWDOWN IN HOUSING UNIT STARTS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION OUTLOOK ACROSS THE COMPANY\u2019S GEOGRAPHIC FOOTPRINT REMAINS POSITIVE FOR BOTH SINGLE- AND MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING, DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE DEMOGRAPHICS, JOB GROWTH, LAND AVAILABILITY, STEADY INTEREST RATES AND EFFICIENT PERMITTING. ON A NATIONAL LEVEL, HOUSING STARTS REMAIN BELOW THE 50-YEAR ANNUAL AVERAGE OF 1.5 MILLION DESPITE NOTABLE POPULATION GAINS. THE RESIDENTIAL MARKET ACCOUNTED FOR 23% OF FIRST-QUARTER AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS.  THE CHEMROCK/RAIL MARKET ACCOUNTED FOR THE REMAINING 7% OF FIRST-QUARTER AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS. VOLUMES TO THIS SECTOR DECREASED 9%, DRIVEN BY REDUCED AGRICULTURAL LIME SHIPMENTS FROM A DEPRESSED FARM ECONOMY.

FOR THE FIRST QUARTER, CONSOLIDATED OTHER OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSES), NET, WAS INCOME OF $4.8 MILLION IN 2019 AND EXPENSE OF $0.5 MILLION IN 2018.  THE 2019 AMOUNT REFLECTS THE REVERSAL OF A $4.2 MILLION PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ACCRUAL RELATED TO THE TEXAS INDUSTRIES, INC. ACQUISITION AND HIGHER GAINS ON THE SALES OF ASSETS.  OTHER NONOPERATING INCOME, NET, INCLUDES INTEREST INCOME; PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST, EXCLUDING SERVICE COST; FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES; EQUITY IN EARNINGS OR LOSSES OF NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS INCOME.  FOR THE FIRST QUARTER, OTHER NONOPERATING INCOME, NET, WAS $1.6 MILLION AND $8.5 MILLION IN 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE IN 2019 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST INCOME IN 2018.

FULL-YEAR CAPITAL SPENDING IS EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM $350 MILLION TO $400 MILLION.  THE COMPANY CAN REPURCHASE ITS COMMON STOCK THROUGH OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES PURSUANT TO AUTHORITY GRANTED BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR THROUGH PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS AT SUCH PRICES AND UPON SUCH TERMS AS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER DEEMS APPROPRIATE. THE COMPANY DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF COMMON STOCK DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, 14,147,751 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE REMAINING UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.  THE $700 MILLION REVOLVING FACILITY REQUIRES THE COMPANY\u2019S RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT-TO-CONSOLIDATED EBITDA, AS DEFINED, FOR THE TRAILING-TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD (THE RATIO) TO NOT EXCEED 3.50X AS OF THE END OF ANY FISCAL QUARTER, PROVIDED THAT THE COMPANY MAY EXCLUDE FROM THE RATIO DEBT INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS DURING THE QUARTER OR THE THREE PRECEDING QUARTERS SO LONG AS THE RATIO CALCULATED WITHOUT SUCH EXCLUSION DOES NOT EXCEED 3.75X. ADDITIONALLY, IF THERE ARE NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING FACILITY AND THE $400 MILLION TRADE RECEIVABLE FACILITY, CONSOLIDATED DEBT, INCLUDING DEBT FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS A CO-BORROWER, MAY BE REDUCED BY THE COMPANY\u2019S UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IN EXCESS OF $50 MILLION, SUCH REDUCTION NOT TO EXCEED $200 MILLION, FOR PURPOSES OF THE COVENANT CALCULATION.  THE RATIO IS CALCULATED AS DEBT, INCLUDING DEBT FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS A CO-BORROWER, DIVIDED BY CONSOLIDATED EBITDA, AS DEFINED BY THE COMPANY\u2019S REVOLVING FACILITY, FOR THE TRAILING-TWELVE MONTHS.  CONSOLIDATED EBITDA IS GENERALLY DEFINED AS EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAX EXPENSE, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR CONTINUING  PAGE 35 OF 44  MARTIN MARIETTA MATERIALS, INC.

IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT ON THE RATIO, THE LENDERS CAN TERMINATE THE REVOLVING FACILITY AND TRADE RECEIVABLE FACILITY AND DECLARE ANY OUTSTANDING BALANCES AS IMMEDIATELY DUE.  OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS ON THE TRADE RECEIVABLE FACILITY HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.  CASH ON HAND, ALONG WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S PROJECTED INTERNAL CASH FLOWS AND AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING RESOURCES, INCLUDING ITS ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS, IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE THE CAPITAL RESOURCES NECESSARY TO SUPPORT ANTICIPATED OPERATING NEEDS, COVER DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, ADDRESS NEAR-TERM DEBT MATURITIES, MEET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENT NEEDS, FUND CERTAIN ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY ARISE, ALLOW THE REPURCHASE OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK AND ALLOW FOR PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  ANY FUTURE SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC ACQUISITION FOR CASH WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE OF NEWLY-ISSUED EQUITY WITH DEBT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A COMPOSITE INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT RATING.

PAGE 39 OF 44  MARTIN MARIETTA MATERIALS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  IT  EM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE CONSTRUCTION AND STEELMAKING INDUSTRIES. CONSEQUENTLY, THESE MARKETPLACES COULD EXPERIENCE LOWER LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF RISING INTEREST RATES OR ESCALATING COSTS.  MANAGEMENT HAS CONSIDERED THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS. DEMAND FOR AGGREGATES PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRUCTION MARKET, IS AFFECTED BY FEDERAL AND STATE BUDGET AND DEFICIT ISSUES. FURTHER, DELAYS OR CANCELLATIONS OF CAPITAL PROJECTS IN THE NONRESIDENTIAL AND RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION MARKETS COULD OCCUR IF COMPANIES AND CONSUMERS ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS OR IF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE CONTINUES TO BE ERODED BY ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY.  DEMAND IN THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION MARKET IS AFFECTED BY INTEREST RATES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE DID NOT CHANGE INTEREST RATES DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AT MARCH 31, 2019 WAS 2.4%. THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION MARKET ACCOUNTED FOR 22% OF THE COMPANY\u2019S AGGREGATES PRODUCT LINE SHIPMENTS IN 2018.  ASIDE FROM THESE INHERENT RISKS FROM WITHIN ITS OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES. HOWEVER, RISING INTEREST RATES ARE NOT NECESSARILY PREDICTIVE OF WEAKER OPERATING RESULTS. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY\u2019S PROFITABILITY INCREASED DURING PERIODS OF RISING INTEREST RATES. IN ESSENCE, THE COMPANY\u2019S UNDERLYING BUSINESS GENERALLY SERVES AS A NATURAL HEDGE TO RISING INTEREST RATES.  VARIABLE-RATE BORROWING FACILITIES.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD A $700 MILLION REVOLVING FACILITY AND A $400 MILLION TRADE RECEIVABLE FACILITY. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS $600 MILLION VARIABLE-RATE SENIOR NOTES.  BORROWINGS UNDER THESE FACILITIES BEAR INTEREST AT A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE. A HYPOTHETICAL 100-BASIS-POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ON BORROWINGS OF $1.03 BILLION, WHICH WAS THE COLLECTIVE OUTSTANDING BALANCE AT MARCH 31, 2019, WOULD INCREASE INTEREST EXPENSE BY $10.3 MILLION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.  PENSION EXPENSE.  THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY ITS PENSION EXPENSE. ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT PENSION EXPENSE INCLUDE THE DISCOUNT RATE AND, FOR THE QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ONLY, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY HAS INTEREST RATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS. THE IMPACT OF HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN THESE ASSUMPTIONS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE IS DISCUSSED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  ENERGY COSTS  . ENERGY COSTS, INCLUDING DIESEL FUEL, NATURAL GAS, COAL AND LIQUID ASPHALT, REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION COSTS OF THE COMPANY.  THE CEMENT OPERATIONS AND MAGNESIA SPECIALTIES BUSINESS HAVE FIXED PRICE AGREEMENTS COVERING 100% OF ITS 2019 COAL REQUIREMENTS.  ENERGY COSTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 6% OVER THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.  A HYPOTHETICAL 6% CHANGE IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ENERGY PRICES FOR THE FULL YEAR 2019 AS COMPARED WITH 2018, ASSUMING CONSTANT VOLUMES, WOULD CHANGE FULL YEAR 2019 ENERGY EXPENSE BY $17.0 MILLION.  COMMODITY RISK.  CEMENT IS A COMMODITY AND COMPETITION IS BASED PRINCIPALLY ON PRICE, WHICH IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN SUPPLY AND DEMAND. PRICES ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO MATERIAL CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO RELATIVELY MINOR FLUCTUATIONS IN SUPPLY AND DEMAND, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS BEYOND THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL. INCREASES IN THE PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS OR INCREASES IN CEMENT IMPORTS TEND TO CREATE AN OVERSUPPLY OF SUCH PRODUCTS LEADING TO AN IMBALANCE BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND, WHICH CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PRODUCT PRICES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT PRICES FOR PRODUCTS SOLD WILL NOT DECLINE IN THE FUTURE OR THAT SUCH DECLINES WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  ASSUMING TOTAL REVENUES FOR CEMENT FOR FULL-YEAR 2019 OF $420 MILLION TO $450 MILLION, A HYPOTHETICAL 10% CHANGE IN SALES PRICE WOULD IMPACT NET SALES BY $42.0 MILLION TO $45.0 MILLION.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, AN EVALUATION WAS PERFORMED UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND THE OPERATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. BASED ON THAT EVALUATION, THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANY\u2019S DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE AS OF MARCH 31, 2019.  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.  BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED ACCOUNTING STANDARD CODIFICATION 842,  LEASES  (ASC 842). ALTHOUGH THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD DID NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS AND COMPREHENSIVE EARNINGS OR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED CHANGES TO ITS INTERNAL CONTROLS RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ASC 842. THESE CHANGES INCLUDED A COMPREHENSIVE LEASE SCOPING ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE EACH OF ITS LEASES AND AN IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING APPLICATION TO CALCULATE VALUES FOR ITS RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES. THERE WERE NO OTHER CHANGES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE MOST RECENTLY COMPLETED FISCAL QUARTER THAT MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

THE  $41  MILLION  NET  DECREASE  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS FROM THE END OF FISCAL  2017  TO THE END OF THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO.  \u2022  $230 MILLION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF A $300 MILLION VOLUNTARY PENSION CONTRIBUTION;  \u2022  $185 MILLION OF NET PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS, INCLUDING $250 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE APRIL 2020, $300 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE FEBRUARY 2019, $253 MILLION USED FOR REPAYMENT OF OUR REMAINING OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS UNDER THE 5-YEAR TRANCHE OF OUR VARIABLE-RATE TERM LOANS DUE MAY 29, 2020, $16 MILLION USED FOR REPAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS UNDER THE 3-YEAR TRANCHE OF OUR VARIABLE-RATE TERM LOANS DUE MAY 29, 2018 AND $75 MILLION USED FOR REPAYMENT OF SHORT-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM; AND  \u2022  $31 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM EXERCISES OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS; MORE THAN OFFSET BY  \u2022  $205 MILLION USED TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS;  \u2022  $197 MILLION USED TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK; AND  \u2022  $79 MILLION USED FOR ADDITIONS OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  AT  MARCH 29, 2019  , WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $334  MILLION  , AND WE HAVE A SENIOR UNSECURED $1 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT EXPIRES IN JUNE 2023 (OF WHICH $900 MILLION WAS AVAILABLE TO US AS OF  MARCH 29, 2019  , AS A RESULT OF $100 MILLION OF SHORT-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM). ADDITIONALLY, WE HAD  $3.4 BILLION  OF LONG-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING AT  MARCH 29, 2019  , THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF EXELIS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2015. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR LONG-TERM DEBT, SEE NOTE 13: \u201cDEBT\u201d IN OUR NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  FISCAL 2017-2018 UPDATE 8-K  . OUR  $334  MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT  MARCH 29, 2019  INCLUDED $141 MILLION HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, OF WHICH $67 MILLION WAS CONSIDERED PERMANENTLY REINVESTED. DETERMINING THE FUTURE TAX COST OF REPATRIATING SUCH FUNDS TO THE U.S. IS NOT PRACTICAL AT THIS TIME, BECAUSE THE COST IMPACT OF THE RULES REGARDING THE NETTING OF EARNINGS OF RELATED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IS SUBJECT TO CLARIFICATION. HOWEVER, WE HAVE NO CURRENT PLANS TO REPATRIATE THE FUNDS CONSIDERED PERMANENTLY REINVESTED.  GIVEN OUR CURRENT CASH POSITION, OUTLOOK FOR FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, CREDIT RATINGS, AVAILABLE CREDIT FACILITY, CASH NEEDS AND DEBT STRUCTURE, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED TO DATE, AND DO NOT EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE, ANY MATERIAL ISSUES WITH LIQUIDITY, ALTHOUGH WE CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCES CONCERNING OUR FUTURE LIQUIDITY, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF OUR OVERALL LEVEL OF DEBT, U.S. GOVERNMENT BUDGET UNCERTAINTIES (INCLUDING THE RECENT, OR ANY POTENTIAL SUCCESSIVE, U.S. GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN) AND THE STATE OF GLOBAL COMMERCE AND FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTY.  31  WE ALSO CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT EXISTING CASH, FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, OUR CREDIT FACILITY AND ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DEBT AND EQUITY MARKETS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE FOR OUR ANTICIPATED WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, REPURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND REPAYMENTS OF OUR DEBT SECURITIES AT MATURITY FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE FUTURE THEREAFTER. OUR TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL  2019  ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION. WE ANTICIPATE TAX PAYMENTS IN FISCAL  2019  TO BE LESS THAN OUR TAX EXPENSE FOR THE SAME PERIOD. OTHER THAN THOSE CASH OUTLAYS NOTED IN \u201cCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\u201d IN ITEM 7. \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d IN OUR  FISCAL 2017-2018 UPDATE 8-K  AND \u201cCOMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\u201d BELOW IN THIS MD&A, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, REPURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PENDING MERGER WITH L3 (INCLUDING TRANSACTION AND INTEGRATION COSTS), WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY SIGNIFICANT CASH OUTLAYS DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL  2019.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE CASH FLOWS AT CURRENT LEVELS OR THAT THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF FUTURE BORROWINGS, IF ANY, UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM OR OUR CREDIT FACILITY OR IN THE DEBT MARKETS WILL NOT BE IMPACTED BY ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE CREDIT OR CAPITAL MARKETS DISRUPTIONS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN CASH BALANCES OR GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO SERVICE OUR OBLIGATIONS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO SELL ASSETS, REDUCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, REDUCE OR ELIMINATE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, REDUCE OR TERMINATE OUR SHARE REPURCHASES, REDUCE OR ELIMINATE DIVIDENDS, REFINANCE ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR EXISTING DEBT OR OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING. OUR ABILITY TO MAKE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OR PAY INTEREST ON OR REFINANCE OUR INDEBTEDNESS DEPENDS ON OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL RESULTS, WHICH, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, ARE SUBJECT TO GENERAL CONDITIONS IN OR AFFECTING THE DEFENSE, GOVERNMENT AND OTHER MARKETS WE SERVE AND TO GENERAL ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, FINANCIAL, COMPETITIVE, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  THE  $644 MILLION  INCREASE  IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED WITH THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $300 MILLION VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION TO OUR U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, THE IMPACT OF HIGHER NET INCOME, A  $115 MILLION  DECREASE IN CASH USED TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL, REFLECTING A REDUCTION IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES DESPITE HIGHER REVENUE, AND A  $50 MILLION  DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS TO DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  THE  $23 MILLION  INCREASE  IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED WITH THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A  $25 MILLION  INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR ADDITIONS OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  THE  $526 MILLION  INCREASE  IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED WITH THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO  $278 MILLION  OF NET REPAYMENTS OF BORROWINGS IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH  $185 MILLION  OF NET PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL 2018 AND A  $39 MILLION  INCREASE IN CASH USED TO PAY DIVIDENDS.  FUNDING OF PENSION PLANS  FUNDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE A MAJOR CONSIDERATION IN MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION IN MAKING VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS, THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED BY THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 AND FURTHER AMENDED BY THE WORKER, RETIREE, AND EMPLOYER RECOVERY ACT OF 2008, THE MOVING AHEAD FOR PROGRESS IN THE 21ST CENTURY ACT (\u201cMAP-21\u201d), AND APPLICABLE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REGULATIONS MANDATE MINIMUM FUNDING THRESHOLDS. FAILURE TO SATISFY THE MINIMUM FUNDING THRESHOLDS COULD RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO AMEND THE PLANS OR MAKE BENEFIT PAYMENTS. WITH RESPECT TO OUR U.S. QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WE INTEND TO CONTRIBUTE ANNUALLY NOT LESS THAN THE REQUIRED MINIMUM FUNDING THRESHOLDS.  THE HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION FUNDING ACT OF 2014 AND THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT OF 2015 FURTHER EXTENDED THE INTEREST RATE STABILIZATION PROVISION OF MAP-21 UNTIL 2020. WE MADE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR U.S. QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS OF $300 MILLION AND $400 MILLION DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 AND THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2  017, RESPECTIVELY. AS A RESULT, WE ANTICIPATE MAKING  NO  CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR  U.S. QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS  AND MINOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR NON-U.S. PENSION PLAN DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL  2019.  FUTURE REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS PRIMARILY WILL DEPEND ON THE ACTUAL ANNUAL RETURN ON ASSETS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT THE END OF EACH YEAR. DEPENDING ON THESE FACTORS, AND THE RESULTING FUNDED STATUS OF OUR PENSION PLANS, THE LEVEL OF FUTURE STATUTORY REQUIRED MINIMUM CONTRIBUTIONS COULD BE MATERIAL. WE HAD NET UNFUNDED DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS OF  $601 MILLION  AT  MARCH 29, 2019  . SEE NOTE 14: \u201cPENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\u201d IN OUR NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  FISCAL 2017-2018 UPDATE 8-K  AND  NOTE J \u2014 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS  IN THE NOTES FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR PENSION PLANS.  COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES  DURING THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  , WE USED  $200 MILLION  TO REPURCHASE  1,219,750  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF  $163.99  , INCLUDING COMMISSIONS OF  $.02  PER SHARE. DURING THE  32  FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2018  , WE USED  $197 MILLION  TO REPURCHASE  1,466,713  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF  $134.36  , INCLUDING COMMISSIONS OF  $.01  PER SHARE. IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  AND FISCAL  2018  ,  $24 MILLION  AND  $10 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, IN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WERE DELIVERED TO US OR WITHHELD BY US TO SATISFY WITHHOLDING TAXES ON EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED AWARDS. SHARES PURCHASED BY US ARE CANCELLED AND RETIRED.  AS OF  MARCH 29, 2019  , WE HAD A REMAINING, UNUSED AUTHORIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY  $501 MILLION  UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. REPURCHASES UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM ARE EXPECTED TO BE FUNDED WITH AVAILABLE CASH AND COMMERCIAL PAPER AND MAY BE MADE THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS, TRANSACTIONS STRUCTURED THROUGH INVESTMENT BANKING INSTITUTIONS OR ANY COMBINATION THEREOF. THE LEVEL OF OUR REPURCHASES DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CASH FLOWS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND OTHER FACTORS OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY DEEM RELEVANT. THE TIMING, VOLUME AND NATURE OF REPURCHASES ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS, APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS AND OTHER FACTORS AND ARE AT OUR DISCRETION AND MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. PURSUANT TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT, WE WILL NOT MAKE REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT LEAST UNTIL AFTER CLOSING OF THE PENDING MERGER, WITHOUT L3\u2019S CONSENT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS SET FORTH IN THIS REPORT UNDER PART II. ITEM 2. \u201cUNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.\u201d  DIVIDENDS  ON AUGUST 25, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND RATE ON OUR COMMON STOCK FROM $.570 PER SHARE TO $.685 PER SHARE, FOR AN ANNUALIZED CASH DIVIDEND RATE OF $2.740 PER SHARE, WHICH WAS OUR SEVENTEENTH CONSECUTIVE ANNUAL INCREASE IN OUR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND RATE. OUR ANNUALIZED CASH DIVIDEND RATE IN FISCAL  2018  WAS $2.280 PER SHARE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT OUR ANNUALIZED CASH DIVIDEND RATE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE. QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS ARE TYPICALLY PAID IN MARCH, JUNE, SEPTEMBER AND DECEMBER. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT CASH DIVIDENDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PAID IN THE NEAR FUTURE, BUT WE CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCES CONCERNING PAYMENT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS. THE DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS AND THE AMOUNT THEREOF WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CASH FLOWS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND OTHER FACTORS OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY DEEM RELEVANT.  CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND RESOURCES  2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT.  WE HAVE A $1 BILLION, 5-YEAR SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201c2018 CREDIT FACILITY\u201d) UNDER A REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201c2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) ENTERED INTO ON JUNE 26, 2018 WITH A SYNDICATE OF LENDERS. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE 2018 CREDIT FACILITY AND THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT, SEE NOTE 12: \u201cCREDIT ARRANGEMENTS\u201d IN OUR NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  FISCAL 2017-2018 UPDATE 8-K.  WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS IN THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT AT  MARCH 29, 2019  , INCLUDING THE COVENANT REQUIRING THAT WE NOT PERMIT OUR RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS TO TOTAL CAPITAL, EACH AS DEFINED IN THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT, TO BE GREATER THAN 0.65 TO 1.00. AT  MARCH 29, 2019  , WE HAD NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT BUT WE HAD $100 MILLION IN BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE 2018 CREDIT FACILITY.  LONG-TERM DEBT.  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR LONG-TERM VARIABLE-RATE AND FIXED-RATE DEBT, SEE NOTE 13: \u201cDEBT\u201d IN OUR NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  FISCAL 2017-2018 UPDATE 8-K.  SHORT-TERM DEBT.  OUR SHORT-TERM DEBT AT  MARCH 29, 2019  AND  JUNE 29, 2018  WAS  $103 MILLION  AND  $78 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR SHORT-TERM DEBT AT  MARCH 29, 2019  AND  JUNE 29, 2018  CONSISTED OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LOCAL BORROWING BY INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES FOR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS. OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM WAS SUPPORTED AT  MARCH 29, 2019  AND  JUNE 29, 2018  BY THE 2018 CREDIT FACILITY.  OTHER AGREEMENTS.  WE HAVE A RSA WITH A THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT PERMITS US TO SELL, ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS, UP TO  $50 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES AT ANY GIVEN TIME. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE SOLD CERTAIN CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES UNDER THE RSA, WHICH WE CONTINUE TO SERVICE AND COLLECT ON BEHALF OF THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND WHICH WE ACCOUNT FOR AS SALES OF RECEIVABLES WITH SALE PROCEEDS INCLUDED IN NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE IMPACT TO NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS WAS NOT MATERIAL IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  AND  2018.  33  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DEFINITION UNDER SEC RULES, ANY OF THE FOLLOWING QUALIFY AS OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  \u2022  ANY OBLIGATION UNDER CERTAIN GUARANTEE CONTRACTS;  \u2022  A RETAINED OR CONTINGENT INTEREST IN ASSETS TRANSFERRED TO AN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY OR SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT THAT SERVES AS CREDIT, LIQUIDITY OR MARKET RISK SUPPORT TO THAT ENTITY FOR SUCH ASSETS;  \u2022  ANY OBLIGATION, INCLUDING A CONTINGENT OBLIGATION, UNDER CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS; AND  \u2022  ANY OBLIGATION, INCLUDING A CONTINGENT OBLIGATION, UNDER A MATERIAL VARIABLE INTEREST IN AN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY THAT IS HELD BY, AND MATERIAL TO, THE REGISTRANT, WHERE SUCH ENTITY PROVIDES FINANCING, LIQUIDITY, MARKET RISK OR CREDIT RISK SUPPORT TO THE REGISTRANT, OR ENGAGES IN LEASING, HEDGING OR R&D SERVICES WITH THE REGISTRANT.  AS OF  MARCH 29, 2019  , WE WERE NOT PARTICIPATING IN ANY MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS THAT GENERATED RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, INCLUDING VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, AND WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL RETAINED OR CONTINGENT INTEREST IN ASSETS AS DEFINED ABOVE. AS OF  MARCH 29, 2019  , WE DID NOT HAVE MATERIAL FINANCIAL GUARANTEES OR OTHER CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS, AND WE WERE NOT A PARTY TO ANY RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS THAT MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.  WE HAVE, FROM TIME TO TIME, DIVESTED CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES AND ASSETS. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE DIVESTITURES, WE OFTEN PROVIDE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND/OR INDEMNITIES TO COVER VARIOUS RISKS AND UNKNOWN LIABILITIES, SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND TAX LIABILITIES. WE CANNOT ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY FROM SUCH REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES BECAUSE THEY RELATE TO UNKNOWN CONDITIONS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THE LIABILITIES RELATING TO THESE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.  DUE TO OUR DOWNSIZING OF CERTAIN OPERATIONS PURSUANT TO ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, RESTRUCTURING PLANS OR OTHERWISE, CERTAIN PROPERTIES LEASED BY US HAVE BEEN SUBLET TO THIRD PARTIES. IN THE EVENT ANY OF THESE THIRD PARTIES VACATES ANY OF THESE PREMISES, WE WOULD BE LEGALLY OBLIGATED UNDER MASTER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FINANCIAL RISK OF DEFAULT BY SUCH SUBLESSEES IS INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE NOT MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.  COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN OUR  FISCAL 2017-2018 UPDATE 8-K  INCLUDE OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS. EXCEPT FOR CHANGES IN OUR SHORT-TERM DEBT AS DESCRIBED UNDER \u201cCAPITAL STRUCTURE AND RESOURCES\u201d IN THIS MD&A AND THE REPAYMENT AT MATURITY OF THE ENTIRE $300 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE FEBRUARY 27, 2019, NO MATERIAL CHANGES OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  IN OUR CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS TO REPAY DEBT, TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES, TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER OPERATING LEASES OR OUR COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS, OR IN OUR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ON OUTSTANDING SURETY BONDS, STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS AS DISCLOSED IN OUR  FISCAL 2017-2018 UPDATE 8-K.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, WE HAVE A CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO ISSUE 1.30 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR EACH SHARE OF L3 COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING AT CLOSING OF THE PENDING MERGER, AND WE EXPECT TO INCUR OTHER EXPENSES, SUCH AS TRANSACTION COSTS, OTHER PAYMENTS REQUIRED AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER AND INTEGRATION AND POST-CLOSING RESTRUCTURING COSTS. SEE  NOTE S \u2014 PENDING MERGER  IN THE NOTES FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, WE MAY HAVE OBLIGATIONS UNDER OTHER CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE ACCELERATED OR OTHERWISE IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER.  34  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, EXPENSES AND BACKLOG AS WELL AS DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY THE APPLICATION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES. EFFECTIVE JUNE 30, 2018, WE ADOPTED ASC 606, A NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD UNDER WHICH REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS CONTROL TRANSFERS TO THE CUSTOMER. THE GUIDANCE IN THIS STANDARD IS PRINCIPLES-BASED, AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ENTITIES ARE REQUIRED TO USE MORE JUDGMENT AND MAKE MORE ESTIMATES THAN UNDER PRIOR GUIDANCE, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, ESTIMATING VARIABLE CONSIDERATION TO INCLUDE IN THE CONTRACT PRICE AND ALLOCATING THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. UNDER ASC 606, REVENUE FOR OUR CONTRACTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED OVER TIME USING THE COST-TO-COST METHOD, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE REVENUE RECOGNITION MODEL WE USED FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR CONTRACTS PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD. IN MOST CASES, THE ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS WHERE WE PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED REVENUE AS UNITS WERE DELIVERED HAS CHANGED UNDER ASC 606 SUCH THAT WE NOW RECOGNIZE REVENUE AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN ADDITION, FOR CERTAIN OF OUR CONTRACTS, THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS UNDER ASC 606, WHICH HAS ALTERED THE TIMING OF REVENUE AND MARGIN RECOGNITION. REFER TO NOTE 1 \u2014 \u201cSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d IN OUR NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  FISCAL 2017-2018 UPDATE 8-K  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR UPDATED REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES UPDATED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ADOPTION OF ASC 606, AS WELL AS FOR ALL OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE THAT REQUIRE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND MAY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES FOR US INCLUDE: (I) REVENUE RECOGNITION ON CONTRACTS AND CONTRACT ESTIMATES (DISCUSSED IN GREATER DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS), (II) POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS, (III) PROVISIONS FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY LOSSES, (IV) IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL, AND (V) INCOME TAXES AND TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, SEE \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\u201d IN ITEM 7. \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d IN OUR  FISCAL 2017-2018 UPDATE 8-K.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS DERIVED FROM DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION CONTRACTS. REVENUE AND PROFIT RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME, TYPICALLY USING THE POC COST-TO-COST METHOD OF REVENUE RECOGNITION, WHEREBY WE MEASURE OUR PROGRESS TOWARD COMPLETION OF PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS BASED ON THE RATIO OF COSTS INCURRED TO DATE TO ESTIMATED COSTS AT COMPLETION UNDER THE CONTRACT. BECAUSE COSTS INCURRED REPRESENT WORK PERFORMED, WE BELIEVE THIS METHOD BEST DEPICTS THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO THE CUSTOMER. WE DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE FOR EACH CONTRACT BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE, AND THIS INCLUDES ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, SUCH AS AWARD AND INCENTIVE FEES. THESE VARIABLE AMOUNTS GENERALLY ARE AWARDED UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN NEGOTIATED PERFORMANCE METRICS, PROGRAM MILESTONES OR COST TARGETS AND CAN BE BASED UPON CUSTOMER DISCRETION. WE INCLUDE SUCH ESTIMATED AMOUNTS IN THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE EXTENT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL OF CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED WILL NOT OCCUR WHEN THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION IS RESOLVED.  UNDER THE POC COST-TO-COST METHOD OF REVENUE RECOGNITION, A SINGLE ESTIMATED PROFIT MARGIN IS USED TO RECOGNIZE PROFIT FOR EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION OVER ITS PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE. RECOGNITION OF PROFIT ON A CONTRACT REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL COST AT COMPLETION AND TRANSACTION PRICE AND THE MEASUREMENT OF PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION. DUE TO THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS, DEVELOPING THE ESTIMATED TOTAL COST AT COMPLETION AND TOTAL TRANSACTION PRICE OFTEN REQUIRES JUDGMENT. FACTORS THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING THE COST OF THE WORK TO BE COMPLETED INCLUDE: THE NATURE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE WORK TO BE PERFORMED, SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE AND THE RISK AND IMPACT OF DELAYED PERFORMANCE. FACTORS THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING THE TOTAL TRANSACTION PRICE INCLUDE CONTRACTUAL COST OR PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES (SUCH AS INCENTIVE FEES, AWARD FEES AND PENALTIES) AND OTHER FORMS OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION AS WELL AS OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATION FOR PERFORMANCE ON THE CONTRACT. AT THE OUTSET OF EACH CONTRACT, WE GAUGE ITS COMPLEXITY AND PERCEIVED RISKS AND ESTABLISH AN ESTIMATED TOTAL COST AT COMPLETION IN LINE WITH THESE EXPECTATIONS. AFTER ESTABLISHING THE ESTIMATED TOTAL COST AT COMPLETION, WE FOLLOW A STANDARD EAC PROCESS IN WHICH WE REVIEW THE PROGRESS AND PERFORMANCE ON OUR ONGOING CONTRACTS AT LEAST QUARTERLY AND, IN MANY CASES, MORE FREQUENTLY. IF WE SUCCESSFULLY RETIRE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TECHNICAL, SCHEDULE AND COST ASPECTS OF A CONTRACT, WE MAY LOWER OUR ESTIMATED TOTAL COST AT COMPLETION COMMENSURATE WITH THE RETIREMENT OF THESE RISKS. CONVERSELY, IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN RETIRING THESE RISKS, WE MAY INCREASE OUR ESTIMATED TOTAL COST AT COMPLETION. ADDITIONALLY, AS THE CONTRACT PROGRESSES, OUR ESTIMATES OF TOTAL TRANSACTION PRICE MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE IF, FOR EXAMPLE, WE RECEIVE AWARD FEES THAT ARE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN EXPECTED. WHEN ADJUSTMENTS IN ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS AT COMPLETION OR IN ESTIMATED TOTAL TRANSACTION PRICE ARE DETERMINED, THE RELATED IMPACT ON OPERATING INCOME IS RECOGNIZED USING THE CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP METHOD, WHICH RECOGNIZES IN THE CURRENT PERIOD THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS FOR ALL PRIOR PERIODS. ANY ANTICIPATED LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS ARE FULLY RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE LOSSES BECOME EVIDENT.  35  EAC ADJUSTMENTS HAD THE FOLLOWING IMPACTS TO OPERATING INCOME FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  QUARTER ENDED  THREE QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019  MARCH 30, 2018  MARCH 29, 2019  MARCH 30, 2018  (IN MILLIONS)  FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS  $32  $26  $100  $90  UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS  (26  )  (30  )  (95  )  (105  )  NET OPERATING INCOME ADJUSTMENTS  $6  $(4  )  $5  $(15  )  THIRD  QUARTER  2019  COMPARED WITH  THIRD  QUARTER  2018  .  THE NET FAVORABLE IMPACT TO OPERATING INCOME FROM EAC ADJUSTMENTS IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO THE NET UNFAVORABLE IMPACT TO OPERATING INCOME FROM EAC ADJUSTMENTS IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER COST EFFICIENCIES REALIZED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND THE CONCLUSION OF CERTAIN MISSION NETWORKS PROGRAMS THAT REALIZED COST GROWTH IN THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A  $12 MILLION  UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 FROM A REDUCTION IN ESTIMATED TRANSACTION PRICE FOR A FIXED-PRICE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT.  FIRST  THREE  QUARTERS  2019  COMPARED WITH FIRST  THREE  QUARTERS  2018  .  THE NET FAVORABLE IMPACT TO OPERATING INCOME FROM EAC ADJUSTMENTS IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO THE NET UNFAVORABLE IMPACT TO OPERATING INCOME FROM EAC ADJUSTMENTS IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CONCLUSION OF CERTAIN MISSION NETWORKS PROGRAMS THAT REALIZED COST GROWTH IN FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A  $12 MILLION  UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  FROM A REDUCTION IN ESTIMATED TRANSACTION PRICE FOR A FIXED-PRICE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT.  WE ALSO RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. FOR THESE CONTRACTS, WE ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BASED ON THE RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE OF THE GOOD OR SERVICE UNDERLYING EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. THE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT FOR WHICH WE WOULD SELL THE GOOD OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER ON A STANDALONE BASIS (I.E., NOT SOLD AS BUNDLED SALE WITH ANY OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES). THE ALLOCATION OF TRANSACTION PRICE AMONG SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS MAY IMPACT THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION BUT WILL NOT CHANGE THE TOTAL REVENUE RECOGNIZED ON THE CONTRACT. OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING FOREIGN MILITARY SALES CONTRACTS, ARE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS AND THE PRICES OF OUR CONTRACT DELIVERABLES ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON OUR ESTIMATED OR ACTUAL COSTS PLUS A REASONABLE PROFIT MARGIN. AS A RESULT, THE STANDALONE SELLING PRICES OF THE GOODS AND SERVICES IN THESE CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY EQUAL TO THE SELLING PRICES STATED IN THE CONTRACT, THEREBY ELIMINATING THE NEED TO ALLOCATE (OR REALLOCATE) THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. IN OUR NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, WE ALSO GENERALLY USE THE EXPECTED COST PLUS A MARGIN APPROACH TO DETERMINE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE. IN ADDITION, WE DETERMINE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE FOR CERTAIN CONTRACTS THAT ARE COMMERCIAL IN NATURE BASED ON OBSERVABLE SELLING PRICES.

OVERVIEW  EARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC., A DELAWARE CORPORATION (\"EARTHSTONE\" AND TOGETHER WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, THE \"COMPANY,\" \"OUR,\" \"WE,\" \"US,\" OR SIMILAR TERMS), IS A GROWTH-ORIENTED INDEPENDENT OIL AND GAS COMPANY ENGAGED IN THE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES THROUGH ACTIVITIES THAT INCLUDE THE ACQUISITION, DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT OF UNDEVELOPED LEASES, ASSET AND CORPORATE ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS. OUR OPERATIONS ARE ALL IN THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT OF THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY AND ALL OUR PROPERTIES ARE ONSHORE IN THE UNITED STATES. AT PRESENT, OUR PRIMARY ASSETS ARE LOCATED IN THE MIDLAND BASIN OF WEST TEXAS AND THE EAGLE FORD TREND OF SOUTH TEXAS.  OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS CONCENTRATED IN THE MIDLAND BASIN OF WEST TEXAS WHERE OUR ACREAGE HAS MULTIPLE STACKED PAY INTERVALS IN THE WOLFCAMP AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE SPRABERRY FORMATIONS. WE BELIEVE THE MIDLAND BASIN AREA IS CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH OIL AND LIQUIDS-RICH NATURAL GAS CONTENT, MULTIPLE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL TARGET HORIZONS AND HIGH DRILLING SUCCESS RATES.  EARTHSTONE IS THE SOLE MANAGING MEMBER OF EARTHSTONE ENERGY HOLDINGS, LLC, A DELAWARE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY (TOGETHER WITH ITS WHOLLY-OWNED CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, \u201cEEH\u201d), WITH A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN EEH. EARTHSTONE, TOGETHER WITH ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, LYNDEN ENERGY CORP., A CORPORATION ORGANIZED UNDER THE LAWS OF BRITISH COLUMBIA (\u201cLYNDEN CORP\u201d), AND LYNDEN CORP\u2019S WHOLLY-OWNED CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY, LYNDEN USA INC., A UTAH CORPORATION (\u201cLYNDEN US\u201d) AND ALSO A MEMBER OF EEH, CONSOLIDATES THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF EEH AND RECORDS A NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPRESENTING THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF EEH'S MEMBERS OTHER THAN EARTHSTONE AND LYNDEN US.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLANS  OUR PLANS INCLUDE A CONTINUED FOCUS ON THE MIDLAND BASIN THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PROPERTIES AND BY FURTHER EXPANSION OF OUR ACREAGE FOOTPRINT AS AN OPERATOR. OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR 2019 PRESENTLY INCLUDES DRILLING APPROXIMATELY 16 OPERATED WELLS AND COMPLETING 13 OF THESE OPERATED WELLS.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ASSUMED PARTICIPATING IN DRILLING 20 WELLS AND COMPLETING 19 WELLS WHERE WE HAVE A NON-OPERATED WORKING INTEREST. AT OUR EAGLE FORD TREND PROPERTIES, OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES DRILLING APPROXIMATELY SEVEN OPERATED WELLS AND COMPLETING SEVEN WELLS. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE PLANS, WE HAVE AN APPROVED ANNUAL BUDGET OF $190.0 MILLION. COMMODITY PRICES CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE AND WE INTEND TO BE VIGILANT TO ADJUST OUR BUSINESS PLANS ACCORDINGLY.  IN ADDITION TO OUR CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR 2019, OUR PLANS ALSO INCLUDE AN ACREAGE EXPANSION PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE CAN TRADE ACREAGE WITH OTHER OPERATORS OR BOLT ON ACREAGE THROUGH ACQUISITIONS. OUR INTENT IS TO INCREASE OUR OVERALL OPERATED LOCATIONS AND ALLOW US TO DEVELOP OUR ACREAGE WITH LONG HORIZONTAL LATERALS (7,500 TO 12,000+ FOOT LATERAL LENGTHS). WE WILL ALSO REMAIN ACTIVE IN SEEKING M&A TRANSACTIONS IN THIS HIGH ECONOMIC RETURN GEOGRAPHIC AREA.  AREAS OF OPERATION  OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS CONCENTRATED IN THE MIDLAND BASIN OF WEST TEXAS, A HIGH OIL AND LIQUIDS RICH RESOURCE WHICH PROVIDES US WITH MULTIPLE HORIZONTAL TARGETS WITH PROVEN PRODUCTION RESULTS, LONG-LIVED RESERVES AND HISTORICALLY HIGH DRILLING SUCCESS RATES.  MIDLAND BASIN  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE COMPLETED SIX WELLS (THREE OPERATED AND THREE NON-OPERATED) AND SPUD AN ADDITIONAL 12 WELLS (THREE OPERATED AND NINE NON-OPERATED) DURING THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF 2019. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO COMPLETE APPROXIMATELY 10 OPERATED WELLS OVER THE LATTER HALF OF 2019. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO INITIATE COMPLETION ACTIVITIES WHEN WE ACCUMULATE AN ADEQUATE INVENTORY OF WELLS FOR EFFICIENT OPERATIONS.  COMMENCING IN EARLY 2018, MARKET CONCERNS ABOUT FUTURE TAKE-AWAY CAPACITY ADVERSELY AFFECTED OIL AND GAS PRICE DIFFERENTIALS IN THE MIDLAND BASIN. SINCE THEN, THE MARKET CONCERNS HAVE BEEN ABATED AS ADDITIONAL OIL PIPELINES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE TAKE-AWAY INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE AREA.  CONSEQUENTLY, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THESE NEGATIVE OIL PRICE DIFFERENTIALS.   NATURAL GAS PRICE DIFFERENTIALS CONTINUE TO GROW AS FUTURE TAKE-AWAY CAPACITY IN THE AREA IS BEING CHALLENGED. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL GAS PIPELINES EXPECTED TO COME ON LINE ON OR ABOUT THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019.  WHILE WE BELIEVE THE ECONOMIC RETURNS FROM OUR OPERATIONS ARE VERY ATTRACTIVE AT CURRENT PRICE LEVELS AND OUR WELLS ARE MEETING OR EXCEEDING OUR TYPE CURVES, OUR CASHFLOWS ARE BEING IMPACTED BY NEGATIVE DIFFERENTIALS, (EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF DERIVATIVES). INCREASING AND SUSTAINED NEGATIVE OIL AND GAS PRICE DIFFERENTIALS WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND COULD CAUSE US TO REDUCE THE PACE OF DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PROPERTIES.  EAGLE FORD TREND  IN OUR OPERATED LEASEHOLD ACREAGE LOCATED IN THE EAGLE FORD TREND, WE HAVE COMMENCED DRILLING OPERATIONS AND EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE SEVEN WELL PROGRAM BY THE END OF 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d) REQUIRES US TO USE OUR JUDGMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT CERTAIN AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THUS IMPACT AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FUTURE. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT INVOLVE JUDGMENT AND UNCERTAINTIES AFFECTING THE APPLICATION OF THOSE POLICIES AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS WOULD BE REPORTED UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OR USING DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS. WE PERIODICALLY UPDATE OUR ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR LATEST ASSESSMENT OF THE CURRENT AND PROJECTED BUSINESS AND GENERAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  , WE RECORDED AN INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR EARTHSTONE OF $0.9 MILLION AS A RESULT OF ITS SHARE OF THE DISTRIBUTABLE INCOME FROM EEH, WHICH WAS USED TO REDUCE THE VALUATION RECORDED AGAINST ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSET AS FUTURE REALIZATION OF THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET CANNOT BE ASSURED. LYNDEN CORP INCURRED NO MATERIAL INCOME OR LOSS, OR RELATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE AND FUTURE DRILLING LOCATIONS. DRILLING HORIZONTAL WELLS, GENERALLY CONSISTING OF 7,500 TO 12,000-FOOT LATERAL LENGTHS, IN THE MIDLAND BASIN IS CAPITAL INTENSIVE. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  $0.4 MILLION  IN CASH AND APPROXIMATELY  $154 MILLION  IN UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE EEH CREDIT AGREEMENT (DISCUSSED BELOW) AVAILABLE FOR OPERATIONAL AND CAPITAL FUNDING. WE CURRENTLY ESTIMATE 2019 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $190 MILLION, OF WHICH $48.5 MILLION HAS BEEN SPENT THROUGH MARCH 31, 2019. OUR 2019 CAPITAL PROGRAM ASSUMES A 16-WELL PROGRAM RUNNING ONE RIG FOR OUR OPERATED ACREAGE IN THE MIDLAND BASIN AND A SEVEN-WELL PROGRAM FOR OUR OPERATED EAGLE FORD ACREAGE AS WELL AS ESTIMATED EXPENDITURES FOR OUR NON-OPERATED MIDLAND BASIN PROPERTIES AND LAND AND INFRASTRUCTURE ACTIVITIES. WE LIKELY WILL CONTINUE TO OUTSPEND OUR CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OVER AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF THIS REPORT BASED ON CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE WE WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY WITH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS UNDER THE EEH CREDIT AGREEMENT FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS IN ORDER TO MEET OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS. WE MAY CONSIDER VARIOUS FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER TECHNIQUES OR TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROMOTED DRILLING ARRANGEMENTS.  WORKING CAPITAL, DEFINED HEREIN AS TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS LESS TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES AS SET FORTH IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, WAS A DEFICIT OF  $28.8 MILLION  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO A DEFICIT OF  $18.3 MILLION  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . OUR COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN TIMELY AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT.  THE INCREASE IN THE DEFICIT IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A NET DECREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS EXPECTED TO SETTLE OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED RECEIVABLES AND DECREASED PAYABLES.  WE EXPECT THAT CHANGES IN RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES RELATED TO OUR PACE OF DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION VOLUMES, CHANGES IN OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES, REALIZED COMMODITY PRICES AND DIFFERENTIALS TO NYMEX PRICES FOR OUR OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE LARGEST VARIABLES AFFECTING OUR WORKING CAPITAL.  WE EXPECT TO FINANCE FUTURE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES WITH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, BORROWINGS UNDER THE EEH CREDIT AGREEMENT AND, VARIOUS MEANS OF CORPORATE AND PROJECT FINANCING, ASSUMING WE CAN EFFECTIVELY ACCESS DEBT AND EQUITY MARKETS. IN ADDITION, AS INDICATED ABOVE, WE MAY CONTINUE TO PARTIALLY FINANCE OUR DRILLING ACTIVITIES THROUGH THE SALE OF PARTICIPATING RIGHTS TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, AND WE COULD STRUCTURE SUCH ARRANGEMENTS ON A PROMOTED BASIS, WHEREBY WE MAY EARN WORKING INTERESTS IN RESERVES AND PRODUCTION GREATER THAN OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF CAPITAL COSTS.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  WERE  $7.1 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $16.8 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO USE OF CASH FROM CHANGES IN PAYABLES AND RECEIVABLES RELATED TO OUR OPERATION OF OUR OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SOURCES OF CASH FROM CHANGES IN CASH SETTLEMENTS OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE  $48.5 MILLION  AND  $33.2  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED DRILLING AND COMPLETION ACTIVITY AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE  $41.5 MILLION  AND  $4.5 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET BORROWINGS UNDER THE EEH CREDIT AGREEMENT IN THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER WHICH WERE USED TO FUND OUR DRILLING AND COMPLETION ACTIVITIES.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  OUR 2019 CAPITAL BUDGET ASSUMES A ONE-RIG OPERATED PROGRAM AND NON-OPERATED ACTIVITIES AS CURRENTLY PROPOSED BY OPERATORS, FOR OUR ACREAGE IN THE MIDLAND BASIN AS WELL AS A SEVEN-WELL PROGRAM ON OUR OPERATED EAGLE FORD ACREAGE. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR 2019 ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY $190.0 MILLION, OF WHICH WE SPENT  $48.5 MILLION  ON A CASH BASIS AND INCURRED  $42.7 MILLION  ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 (THE DIFFERENCE OF $5.8 MILLION REPRESENTING A DECREASE IN ACCRUED BUT UNPAID CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FROM DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO MARCH 31, 2019).  OUR ACCRUAL BASIS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  WERE AS FOLLOWS (  IN THOUSANDS  ).

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LOANS AND DEPOSITS IS BELOW.  CAPITAL ADEQUACY  CAPITAL SERVES AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS AND HELPS PROTECT DEPOSITORS AND SHAREHOLDERS AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES.  THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY MAINTAINED SUBSTANTIAL LEVELS OF CAPITAL.  THE ASSESSMENT OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY IS DEPENDENT ON SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING ASSET QUALITY, EARNINGS TRENDS, LIQUIDITY AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  MAINTENANCE OF ADEQUATE CAPITAL LEVELS IS INTEGRAL TO PROVIDING STABILITY TO THE COMPANY.  THE COMPANY NEEDS TO MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIAL LEVELS OF REGULATORY CAPITAL TO GIVE IT FLEXIBILITY IN THE CHANGING REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDING ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES.  THE COMPANY AND THE BANK ARE EACH SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED BY FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES.  FAILURE TO MEET MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MAY CAUSE CERTAIN MANDATORY AND DISCRETIONARY ACTIONS BY REGULATORS THAT, IF UNDERTAKEN, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  UNDER CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES AND THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION, THE COMPANY AND THE BANK MUST MEET SPECIFIC CAPITAL GUIDELINES THAT INVOLVE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE MEASURES.  THESE MEASURES WERE ESTABLISHED BY BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES TO ENSURE CAPITAL ADEQUACY.  AS OF AUGUST 30, 2018, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF LESS THAN $3 BILLION AND BANKS LIKE CENTRAL VALLEY COMMUNITY BANK BECAME SUBJECT TO NEW CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE NEW RULES ARE BEING PHASED IN THROUGH 2019 UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND BASEL III.

THE BANK\u2019S CAPITAL RATIOS EXCEEDED THE REGULATORY GUIDELINES FOR A WELL-CAPITALIZED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION UNDER THE BASEL III REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  .  THE COMPANY\u2019S REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS ARE PRESENTED IN THE TABLE IN THE  \u201cCAPITAL\u201d  SECTION BELOW.  OPERATING EFFICIENCY  OPERATING EFFICIENCY IS THE MEASURE OF HOW EFFICIENTLY EARNINGS BEFORE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND TAXES ARE GENERATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE.  WHEN MEASURING OPERATING EFFICIENCY, A LOWER RATIO IS MORE FAVORABLE.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFICIENCY RATIO (OPERATING EXPENSES, EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AND FORECLOSED PROPERTY EXPENSE, DIVIDED BY NET INTEREST INCOME BEFORE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES (COMPUTED ON A TAX EQUIVALENT BASIS) PLUS NON-INTEREST INCOME, EXCLUDING GAINS AND LOSSES FROM SALES OF SECURITIES AND OREO, AND GAINS RELATED TO THE COLLECTION OF LIFE INSURANCE PROCEEDS) WAS  63.92%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  62.59%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE EFFICIENCY RATIO IS DUE TO THE GROWTH IN NON-INTEREST EXPENSE OUTPACING THE GROWTH IN NON-INTEREST INCOME.  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CHANGE IN NET INTEREST INCOME AND  INCREASE  IN OPERATING EXPENSES IS BELOW.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY\u2019S NET INTEREST INCOME BEFORE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON A NON TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS PLUS NON-INTEREST INCOME, NET OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES RELATED GAINS, LESS GAIN ON SALE OF CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO, AND GAIN RELATED TO THE COLLECTION OF LIFE INSURANCE PROCEEDS,  INCREASE  D  1.38%  TO  $17,909,000  FOR THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $17,666,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , WHILE OPERATING EXPENSES, NET OF LOSSES ON SALE OF ASSETS, ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS, AND AMORTIZATION OF CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES,  INCREASE  D  3.53%  TO  $11,448,000  FROM  $11,058,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  LIQUIDITY  LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT INVOLVES THE BANK\u2019S ABILITY TO MEET CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS ARISING FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN DEPOSIT LEVELS AND DEMANDS OF DAILY OPERATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE PROVIDING FOR CUSTOMERS\u2019 CREDIT NEEDS, FUNDING OF SECURITIES PURCHASES, AND ONGOING REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS.  OUR LIQUIDITY IS ACTIVELY MANAGED ON A DAILY BASIS AND REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY OUR MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS\u2019 ASSET/LIABILITY COMMITTEE.  THIS PROCESS IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THE MAINTENANCE OF SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR FUNDING NEEDS, INCLUDING ADEQUATE CASH FLOW FOR OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE DERIVED FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES WHICH INCLUDE THE ACCEPTANCE OF CUSTOMER AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, BROKER DEPOSITS, FEDERAL FUNDS FACILITIES AND ADVANCES FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO (FHLB).  WE HAVE AVAILABLE UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT WITH CORRESPONDENT BANKS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  $40,000,000  AND SECURED BORROWING LINES OF APPROXIMATELY  $287,839,000  WITH THE FHLB.  THESE FUNDING SOURCES ARE AUGMENTED BY COLLECTION OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON LOANS, THE ROUTINE MATURITIES AND PAY DOWNS OF SECURITIES FROM OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, THE STABILITY OF OUR CORE DEPOSITS, AND THE ABILITY TO SELL INVESTMENT SECURITIES.  PRIMARY USES OF FUNDS INCLUDE ORIGINATION AND PURCHASES OF LOANS, WITHDRAWALS OF AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON DEPOSITS, PURCHASES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, AND PAYMENT OF OPERATING EXPENSES.  WE HAD LIQUID ASSETS (CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS, INTEREST-EARNING DEPOSITS IN OTHER BANKS, FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, AND EQUITY SECURITIES) TOTALING  $519,203,000  OR  33.19%  OF TOTAL ASSETS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  $502,886,000  OR  32.70%  OF TOTAL ASSETS AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018.

ANNUALIZED ROA FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  WAS  1.35%  AND  1.30%  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE  DECREASE  IN NET INCOME FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY  AN  INCREASE  IN  NON-INTEREST EXPENSE AND AN  INCREASE  IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN  INCREASE  IN NET INTEREST INCOME AND AN  INCREASE  IN NET REALIZED GAINS ON SALES AND CALLS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY RECORDED A  $25,000  REVERSAL OF THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, COMPARED TO A  NO  PROVISION DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE  NET INTEREST INCOME IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OUR INCOME FROM OPERATIONS.  NET INTEREST INCOME (THE \u201cINTEREST RATE SPREAD\u201d) IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROSS INTEREST AND FEES EARNED ON THE LOAN AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS AND THE INTEREST PAID ON DEPOSITS AND OTHER BORROWINGS.  NET INTEREST INCOME DEPENDS ON THE VOLUME OF AND INTEREST RATE EARNED ON INTEREST EARNING ASSETS AND THE VOLUME OF AND INTEREST RATE PAID ON INTEREST BEARING LIABILITIES.

NET INTEREST INCOME FOR THE PERIOD ENDING  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS BENEFITED BY APPROXIMATELY  $127,000  IN NONRECURRING INCOME FROM PREPAYMENT PENALTIES AND PAYOFF OF LOANS PREVIOUSLY ON NONACCRUAL STATUS, COMPARED TO A  $21,000  IN INCOME REVERSALS RECORDED IN THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THE IMPACT TO INTEREST INCOME FROM THE ACCRETION OF THE LOAN MARKS ON ACQUIRED LOANS WAS  $259,000  AND  $258,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE REMAINING BALANCE OF ACCRETABLE LOAN MARKS ON ACQUIRED LOANS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  $4,646,000.  INTEREST INCOME FROM TOTAL INVESTMENTS ON A NON TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS (TOTAL INVESTMENTS INCLUDE INVESTMENT SECURITIES, FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD, INTEREST BEARING DEPOSITS WITH OTHER BANKS, AND OTHER SECURITIES)  INCREASE  D  $11,000  IN THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  TO  $3,735,000  COMPARED TO  $3,724,000  , FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THE YIELD ON AVERAGE TOTAL INVESTMENTS (TOTAL SECURITIES AND INTEREST-EARNING DEPOSITS)  INCREASE  D  36  BASIS POINTS TO  3.13%  FOR THE  THREE  MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  2.77%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  AVERAGE TOTAL SECURITIES AND INTEREST-EARNING DEPOSITS FOR THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  DECREASE  D  $81,956,000  OR  14.19%  TO  $495,805,000  COMPARED TO  $577,761,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS REPRESENTS  23.59%  OF NET INTEREST INCOME FOR THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO  24.14%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE YIELDS, WITHOUT ACCEPTING UNREASONABLE RISK, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INVESTMENT PURCHASES HAVE BEEN IN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MBS) AND COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMOS).  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HELD  $349,730,000  OR  72.92%  OF THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IN MBS AND CMOS WITH AN AVERAGE YIELD OF  3.18%  AS COMPARED TO  $361,080,000  AND  $294,304,000  WITH AVERAGE YIELDS OF  2.81%  AND  2.63%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  WE INVEST IN CMOS AND MBS AS PART OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY TO INCREASE OUR NET INTEREST MARGIN.  CMOS AND MBS BY THEIR NATURE REACT TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES.  IN A NORMAL DECLINING RATE ENVIRONMENT, PREPAYMENTS FROM MBS AND CMOS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO INCREASE AND THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT WOULD BE EXPECTED TO SHORTEN.  CONVERSELY, IF INTEREST RATES INCREASE, PREPAYMENTS NORMALLY WOULD BE EXPECTED TO DECLINE AND THE AVERAGE LIFE OF THE MBS AND CMOS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO EXTEND.  HOWEVER, IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, PREPAYMENTS MAY NOT BEHAVE ACCORDING TO HISTORICAL NORMS.  PREMIUM AMORTIZATION AND DISCOUNT ACCRETION OF THESE INVESTMENTS AFFECTS OUR NET INTEREST INCOME.  MANAGEMENT MONITORS THE PREPAYMENT SPEED OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND ADJUSTS PREMIUM AMORTIZATION AND DISCOUNT ACCRETION BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS.  THESE FACTORS INCLUDE THE TYPE OF INVESTMENT, THE INVESTMENT STRUCTURE, INTEREST RATES, INTEREST RATES ON NEW MORTGAGE LOANS, EXPECTATION OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE LEVEL OF PRINCIPAL REMAINING ON THE BOND, THE BOND COUPON RATE, THE BOND ORIGINATION DATE, AND VOLUME OF AVAILABLE BONDS IN MARKET.  THE CALCULATION OF PREMIUM AMORTIZATION AND DISCOUNT ACCRETION REPRESENTS MANAGEMENT\u2019S REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF PRINCIPAL PAY DOWNS INHERENT IN THE TOTAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE NET-OF-TAX UNREALIZED  GAIN  ON THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WAS  $922,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND IS REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S EQUITY.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE AVERAGE LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WAS  3.31  YEARS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO REFLECTED A NET PRE-TAX UNREALIZED  GAIN  OF  $1,309,000  .  MANAGEMENT REVIEWS FAIR VALUE DECLINES ON INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT SECURITIES TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY REPRESENT AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT (OTTI).  REFER TO  NOTE 3  OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR MORE DETAIL.  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018  , NO OTTI WAS RECORDED.  ADDITIONAL DETERIORATION IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES, IF ANY, MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO RECOGNIZE OTTI LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.  A COMPONENT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S STRATEGIC PLAN HAS BEEN TO USE ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO OFFSET, IN PART, ITS INTEREST RATE RISK RELATING TO VARIABLE RATE LOANS.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE ESTIMATE AN IMMEDIATE RATE INCREASE OF 200 BASIS POINTS WOULD RESULT IN AN ESTIMATED DECREASE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO BY APPROXIMATELY  $34,000,000  OR  7.33%  .  CONVERSELY, WITH AN IMMEDIATE RATE DECREASE OF 200 BASIS POINTS, THE ESTIMATED INCREASE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WOULD BE  $16,000,000  OR  3.45%  .  OUR MODELING ENVIRONMENT ASSUMES MANAGEMENT WOULD TAKE NO ACTION DURING AN IMMEDIATE SHOCK OF 200 BASIS POINTS.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY USES THOSE INCREMENTS TO MEASURE ITS INTEREST RATE RISK IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND RISK TOLERANCE POLICY LIMITS ESTABLISHED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO MEASURE THE POSSIBLE FUTURE RISK IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S REVIEW OF ALL INVESTMENTS BEFORE PURCHASE INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF HOW THE SECURITY WILL PERFORM UNDER SEVERAL INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS TO MONITOR WHETHER INVESTMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR INVESTMENT POLICY.  THE POLICY ADDRESSES ISSUES OF AVERAGE LIFE, DURATION, CONCENTRATION GUIDELINES, PROHIBITED INVESTMENTS, IMPAIRMENT, AND PROHIBITED PRACTICES.  TOTAL INTEREST INCOME ON A NON-TAX EQUIVALENT BASIS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  INCREASE  D  $559,000  OR  3.55%  TO  $16,289,000  COMPARED TO  $15,730,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .

OTHER BORROWINGS INCLUDE ADVANCES FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK (FHLB), ADVANCES ON AVAILABLE UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT WITH CORRESPONDENT BANKS, AND JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURES.  THE DEBENTURES WERE ACQUIRED IN THE MERGER WITH SERVICE 1ST AND CARRY A FLOATING RATE BASED ON THE THREE MONTH LIBOR PLUS A MARGIN OF 1.60%.  THE RATES WERE  4.39%  AND  3.32%  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  SEE THE SECTION ON \u201cFINANCIAL CONDITION\u201d FOR MORE DETAIL.

THE COST OF TOTAL DEPOSITS INCREASED SLIGHTLY TO  0.12%  COMPARED TO  0.07%  FOR THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  .  AVERAGE NON-INTEREST BEARING DEMAND DEPOSITS  DECREASE  D  1.95%  TO  $543,137,000  IN  2019  COMPARED TO  $553,931,000  FOR  2018  .  THE RATIO OF AVERAGE NON-INTEREST BEARING DEMAND DEPOSITS TO AVERAGE TOTAL DEPOSITS INCREASED TO  42.10%  IN THE  THREE-MONTH  PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  40.01%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.

THE  INCREASE  WAS A RESULT OF YIELD CHANGES, ASSET MIX CHANGES, AND A  DECREASE  IN AVERAGE INTEREST BEARING LIABILITIES, SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN AVERAGE EARNING ASSETS.  IN ADDITION, NET INTEREST INCOME BEFORE THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY  $127,000  DUE TO NONRECURRING INCOME FROM PREPAYMENT PENALTIES AND PAYOFF OF LOANS PREVIOUSLY ON NONACCRUAL STATUS, COMPARED TO  $21,000  REVERSAL OF INCOME FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  EXCLUDING THESE REVERSALS AND BENEFITS, NET INTEREST INCOME FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  INCREASED BY  $261,000  COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  WE PROVIDE FOR PROBABLE INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES THROUGH A CHARGE TO OPERATING INCOME BASED UPON THE COMPOSITION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO, DELINQUENCY LEVELS, HISTORICAL LOSSES, AND NONPERFORMING ASSETS, ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS WHICH, IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT, DESERVE RECOGNITION IN ESTIMATING CREDIT LOSSES.  LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF WHEN THEY ARE CONSIDERED UNCOLLECTIBLE OR WHEN CONTINUANCE AS AN ACTIVE EARNING BANK ASSET IS NOT WARRANTED.  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ADEQUATE CREDIT ALLOWANCE IS BASED ON BOTH AN ACCURATE RISK RATING SYSTEM AND LOAN PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT TOOLS.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAVE ESTABLISHED INITIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY OF CREDIT RISK GRADES WITH THE INDIVIDUAL CREDIT OFFICER.  THE CREDIT REVIEW OFFICER (CRO) WILL REVIEW LOANS TO ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF THE RISK GRADE AND IS EMPOWERED TO CHANGE ANY RISK GRADE, AS APPROPRIATE.  THE CRO IS NOT INVOLVED IN LOAN ORIGINATIONS.  QUARTERLY, THE CREDIT OFFICERS MUST CERTIFY THE CURRENT RISK GRADE OF THE LOANS IN THEIR PORTFOLIO.  THE CRO REVIEWS THE CERTIFICATIONS.  AT LEAST QUARTERLY THE CRO REPORTS HIS ACTIVITIES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUDIT COMMITTEE; AND AT LEAST ANNUALLY THE LOAN PORTFOLIO IS REVIEWED BY A THIRD PARTY CREDIT REVIEWER AND BY VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES.  QUARTERLY, THE CHIEF CREDIT OFFICER (CCO) SETS THE SPECIFIC RESERVE FOR ALL IMPAIRED CREDITS.  ADDITIONALLY, THE CCO IS RESPONSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT THE GENERAL RESERVES ON NON-IMPAIRED LOANS ARE PROPERLY SET EACH QUARTER.  THIS PROCESS INCLUDES THE UTILIZATION OF LOAN DELINQUENCY REPORTS, CLASSIFIED ASSET REPORTS, COLLATERAL ANALYSIS AND PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION REPORTS TO ASSIST IN ACCURATELY ASSESSING CREDIT RISK AND ESTABLISHING APPROPRIATE RESERVES.  THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED AT LEAST QUARTERLY BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUDIT COMMITTEE AND BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  GENERAL RESERVES ARE ALLOCATED TO LOAN PORTFOLIO CATEGORIES USING PERCENTAGES WHICH ARE BASED ON BOTH HISTORICAL RISK ELEMENTS SUCH AS DELINQUENCIES AND LOSSES AND PREDICTIVE RISK ELEMENTS SUCH AS ECONOMIC, COMPETITIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS.  WE HAVE ADOPTED THE SPECIFIC RESERVE APPROACH TO ALLOCATE RESERVES TO EACH IMPAIRED CREDIT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTIMATING POTENTIAL LOSS EXPOSURE.  ALTHOUGH THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS PORTFOLIO CATEGORIES, IT IS GENERAL IN NATURE AND AVAILABLE FOR THE LOAN PORTFOLIO IN ITS ENTIRETY.  CHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES MAY BE REQUIRED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF INDEPENDENT LOAN PORTFOLIO EXAMINATIONS, REGULATORY AGENCY EXAMINATIONS, OR OUR OWN INTERNAL REVIEW PROCESS.  ADDITIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED WHEN, IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT, THE ALLOWANCE DOES NOT PROPERLY REFLECT THE PORTFOLIO\u2019S PROBABLE LOSS EXPOSURE.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ALL ADJUSTMENTS, IF ANY, TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ARE SUPPORTED BY THE TIMELY AND CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGIES AND PROCESSES RESULTING IN DETAILED DOCUMENTATION OF THE ALLOWANCE CALCULATION AND OTHER PORTFOLIO TRENDING ANALYSIS.  THE ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS SET FORTH BELOW (IN THOUSANDS).  LOAN TYPE  MARCH 31, 2019  DECEMBER 31, 2018  COMMERCIAL.

IT IS THE POLICY OF MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ADDITIONS TO THE ALLOWANCE SO THAT IT REMAINS ADEQUATE TO COVER ALL PROBABLE INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES THAT EXIST IN THE PORTFOLIO AT THAT TIME.  WE ASSIGN QUALITATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS (Q FACTORS) TO EACH LOAN CATEGORY.  Q FACTORS INCLUDE  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESERVES HELD FOR THE EFFECTS OF LENDING POLICIES, ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND PORTFOLIO TRENDS ALONG WITH OTHER DYNAMICS WHICH MAY CAUSE ADDITIONAL STRESS TO THE PORTFOLIO.  MANAGING HIGH-RISK CREDITS INCLUDES DEVELOPING A BUSINESS STRATEGY WITH THE CUSTOMER TO MITIGATE OUR POTENTIAL LOSSES.  MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO MONITOR THESE CREDITS WITH A VIEW TO IDENTIFYING AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE WHEN, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS MAY BE NECESSARY.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE LEVEL OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ALLOCATED TO COMMERCIAL AND REAL ESTATE LOANS HAS BEEN ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY RECORDED A  $25,000  REVERSE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, COMPARED TO  NO  PROVISION DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THE REVERSE PROVISION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RESULTED FROM OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE OVERALL ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES CONSIDERING A NUMBER OF FACTORS AS DISCUSSED IN THE \u201cALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\u201d SECTION.  THE COMPANY HAD NET RECOVERIES TOTALING  $39,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ,AND  $10,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  NONPERFORMING LOANS, CONSISTING ENTIRELY OF NONACCRUAL LOANS, WERE  $1,548,000  AND  $2,740,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  $4,058,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2018  .  NONPERFORMING LOANS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LOANS WERE  0.17%  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  0.30%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  0.44%  AT  MARCH 31, 2018  .   THE COMPANY HAD  NO  OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED (OREO) AT  MARCH 31, 2019  OR  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE COMPANY HELD  NO  REPOSSESSED ASSETS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  OR  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THE ANNUALIZED NET CHARGE-OFF (RECOVERY) RATIO, WHICH REFLECTS NET CHARGE-OFFS (RECOVERIES) TO AVERAGE LOANS WAS  (0.02)%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , AND  0.00%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  ECONOMIC PRESSURES MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF BORROWERS TO WHOM THE COMPANY HAS EXTENDED CREDIT AND AS A RESULT WHEN NEGATIVE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE ANTICIPATED, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROVISIONS TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.  THE BANK CONDUCTS BANKING OPERATION PRINCIPALLY IN CALIFORNIA\u2019S CENTRAL VALLEY.  THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON AGRICULTURE.  THE AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, RESULTS OF OPERATION AND CASH FLOWS.  WE ARE ALSO DEPENDENT IN A LARGE PART UPON THE BUSINESS ACTIVITY, POPULATION GROWTH, INCOME LEVELS AND REAL ESTATE ACTIVITY IN THIS MARKET AREA.  A DOWNTURN IN AGRICULTURE AND THE AGRICULTURAL RELATED BUSINESSES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY DECLINES IN PRICES AND THE RATES OF PRICE GROWTH FOR VARIOUS CROPS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES.  SIMILARLY, WEAKER PRICES COULD REDUCE THE CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY FARMS AND THE VALUE OF AGRICULTURAL LAND IN OUR LOCAL MARKETS AND THEREBY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFAULT BY OUR BORROWERS OR REDUCE THE FORECLOSURE VALUE OF AGRICULTURAL LAND AND EQUIPMENT THAT SERVE AS COLLATERAL OF OUR LOANS.  FURTHER DECLINES IN COMMODITY PRICES OR COLLATERAL VALUES MAY INCREASE THE INCIDENCE OF DEFAULT BY OUR BORROWERS.  MOREOVER, WEAKER PRICES MIGHT THREATEN FARMING OPERATIONS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY, REDUCING MARKET DEMAND FOR AGRICULTURAL LENDING.  IN PARTICULAR, FARM INCOME HAS SEEN RECENT DECLINES, AND IN LINE WITH THE DOWNTURN IN FARM INCOME, FARMLAND PRICES ARE COMING UNDER PRESSURE.  WE HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROACTIVE IN LOOKING FOR SIGNS OF DETERIORATION WITHIN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO IN AN EFFORT TO MANAGE CREDIT QUALITY AND WORK WITH BORROWERS WHERE POSSIBLE TO MITIGATE LOSSES.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THERE WERE  $16.8 MILLION  IN CLASSIFIED LOANS OF WHICH  $6.5 MILLION  RELATED TO AGRICULTURAL REAL ESTATE,  $2.2 MILLION  TO COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS,  $1.7 MILLION  TO REAL ESTATE OWNER OCCUPIED,  $1.1 MILLION  IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE,  $1.6 MILLION  TO REAL ESTATE CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER LAND LOANS, AND  $2.9 MILLION  TO CONSUMER EQUITY LOANS AND LINES OF CREDIT.  THIS COMPARES TO  $28.4 MILLION  IN CLASSIFIED LOANS OF WHICH  $19.2 MILLION  RELATED TO AGRICULTURAL REAL ESTATE,  $2.6 MILLION  TO COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS,  $0.9 MILLION  TO REAL ESTATE OWNER OCCUPIED,  $1.1 MILLION  TO COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE,  $1.6 MILLION  TO CONSUMER EQUITY AND LINES OF CREDIT, AND  $3.0 MILLION  TO REAL ESTATE CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER LAND LOANS AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE BELIEVE, BASED ON ALL CURRENT AND AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS ADEQUATE TO ABSORB PROBABLE INCURRED LOSSES WITHIN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO.  HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT WE MAY NOT SUSTAIN CHARGE-OFFS WHICH ARE IN EXCESS OF THE ALLOWANCE IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD.  REFER TO THE \u201cALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\u201d SECTION FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  NET INTEREST INCOME AFTER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  NET INTEREST INCOME, AFTER THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, WAS  $15,860,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  $15,426,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  NON-INTEREST INCOME  NON-INTEREST INCOME IS COMPRISED OF CUSTOMER SERVICE CHARGES, LOAN PLACEMENT FEES, NET GAINS ON SALES AND CALLS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, APPRECIATION IN CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF BANK-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE, FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK DIVIDENDS, AND OTHER INCOME.  NON-INTEREST INCOME WAS  $2,976,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  $2,771,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THE  $205,000  OR  7.40%  INCREASE  IN NON-INTEREST INCOME DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN  INCREASE  OF  $237,000  IN NET REALIZED GAINS ON SALES AND CALLS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, OFFSET BY A  $65,000  DECREASE  IN SERVICE CHARGE INCOME AND A  DECREASE  IN LOAN PLACEMENT FEES OF  $27,000.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE REALIZED A NET GAIN ON SALES AND CALLS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF  $1,052,000  COMPARED TO  $815,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THE NET GAINS REALIZED ON SALES AND CALLS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES IN  2019  AND  2018  WERE THE RESULT OF A PARTIAL RESTRUCTURING OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO.  CUSTOMER SERVICE CHARGES  DECREASE  D  $65,000  OR  8.61%  TO  $690,000  FOR THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $755,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  INTERCHANGE FEES  DECREASE  D  $2,000  TO  $343,000  THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $345,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  LOAN PLACEMENT FEES  DECREASE  D  $27,000  OR  16.27%  TO  $139,000  FOR THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $166,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  OTHER INCOME  INCREASE  D  $62,000  THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  THE BANK HOLDS STOCK FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR BORROWING CAPACITY AND GENERALLY EARNS QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS.  WE CURRENTLY HOLD  $6,843,000  IN FHLB STOCK.  WE RECEIVED DIVIDENDS TOTALING  $121,000  IN THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $121,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  NON-INTEREST EXPENSES  SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, REGULATORY ASSESSMENTS, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES, INTERNET BANKING, AND DATA PROCESSING ARE THE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF NON-INTEREST EXPENSES.  NON-INTEREST EXPENSES  INCREASE  D  $299,000  OR  2.63%  TO  $11,667,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $11,368,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THE NET  INCREASE  FOR THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  WAS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY OF  $565,000  , SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS OF  $74,000  , AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES OF  $80,000  , DIRECTORS\u2019 EXPENSES OF  $86,000  , AND ADVERTISING OF  $13,000  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES OF  $217,000  , PROFESSIONAL SERVICES OF  $111,000  , DATA PROCESSING EXPENSES OF  $85,000  , OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSES OF  $58,000  , OTHER NON-INTEREST EXPENSES OF  $27,000  , ATM/DEBIT CARD EXPENSES OF  $10,000  , AND REGULATORY ASSESSMENTS OF  $10,000  .  THE INCREASE IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXPENSES WAS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY OUTSOURCING ITS NETWORK MAINTENANCE AND IT SUPPORT DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WHICH ALSO PRODUCED DECREASES IN SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.  THE INCREASE IN THE DIRECTORS\u2019 EXPENSES WAS RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO CALCULATE THE LIABILITY FOR DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND SPLIT DOLLAR PLANS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFICIENCY RATIO, MEASURED AS THE PERCENTAGE OF NON-INTEREST EXPENSES (EXCLUSIVE OF AMORTIZATION OF CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND FORECLOSURE EXPENSES) TO NET INTEREST INCOME BEFORE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES (CALCULATED ON A FULLY TAX EQUIVALENT BASIS) PLUS NON-INTEREST INCOME (EXCLUSIVE OF NET REALIZED GAINS ON SALES AND CALLS OF INVESTMENTS, OREO RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES, AND GAINS RELATED TO THE COLLECTION OF LIFE INSURANCE PROCEEDS) WAS  63.92%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO  62.59%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE EFFICIENCY RATIO IS DUE TO THE GROWTH IN NON-INTEREST EXPENSE OUTPACING THE GROWTH IN NON-INTEREST INCOME.  SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS  INCREASE  D  $74,000  OR  1.15%  TO  $6,490,000  FOR THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $6,416,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .

THE DECREASE OF SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS IN 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 IS A RESULT OF A DECREASE OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES, OFFSET BY NORMAL CYCLES AND SALARY INCREASES, AND BONUS PAYOUTS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSE  DECREASE  D  $58,000  OR  3.77%  TO  $1,479,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  $1,537,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THE COMPANY MADE NO CHANGES IN ITS DEPRECIATION EXPENSE METHODOLOGY.  THE COMPANY OPERATED 21 FULL-SERVICE OFFICES AT  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO 24 AT  MARCH 31, 2018  .  SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, THE COMPANY CLOSED ITS TRACY OFFICE AND SOLD A PORTION OF THE CUSTOMER DEPOSITS TO ANOTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.  THE COMPANY ALSO CONSOLIDATED TWO BANKING OFFICES INTO BRANCHES CURRENTLY SERVING THE SAME COMMUNITIES - ONE IN VISALIA AND ONE IN FOLSOM DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.

THE DEGREE OF JUDGMENT UTILIZED IN MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS GENERALLY CORRELATES TO THE LEVEL OF THE OBSERVABLE PRICING SCENARIO.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH READILY AVAILABLE ACTIVELY QUOTED PRICES OR FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE CAN BE MEASURED FROM ACTIVELY QUOTED PRICES GENERALLY WILL HAVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF OBSERVABLE PRICING AND A LESSER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT UTILIZED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE.  CONVERSELY, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RARELY TRADED OR NOT QUOTED WILL GENERALLY HAVE LITTLE OR NO OBSERVABLE PRICING AND A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT UTILIZED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE.  OBSERVABLE PRICING SCENARIOS ARE IMPACTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE TYPE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT, WHETHER THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS NEW TO THE MARKET AND NOT YET ESTABLISHED AND THE CHARACTERISTICS SPECIFIC TO THE TRANSACTION.  SEE  NOTE 2  OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE LEVEL OF PRICING TRANSPARENCY ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE.  INVESTMENTS  OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTITIES AND AGENCIES COLLATERALIZED BY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BACKED OBLIGATIONS, PRIVATE LABEL MORTGAGE AND ASSET BACKED SECURITIES (PLMABS), CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, AND OBLIGATIONS OF STATES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISION SECURITIES AND ARE CLASSIFIED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE OR HELD TO MATURITY.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , INVESTMENT SECURITIES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF  $71,665,000  , OR  14.94%  OF OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, WERE HELD AS COLLATERAL FOR PUBLIC FUNDS, SHORT AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, TREASURY, TAX, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.  OUR INVESTMENT POLICIES ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND IMPLEMENTED BY MANAGEMENT.  THEY ARE DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY, TO ENABLE US TO MEET OUR PLEDGING REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC MONEY AND BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS, TO GENERATE A FAVORABLE RETURN ON INVESTMENTS WITHOUT INCURRING UNDUE INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT RISK, AND TO COMPLEMENT OUR LENDING ACTIVITIES.  THE LEVEL OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL EARNING ASSETS IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED HIGHER THAN OUR PEERS DUE PRIMARILY TO A COMPARATIVELY LOW LOAN-TO-DEPOSIT RATIO.  OUR LOAN-TO-DEPOSIT RATIO AT  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  71.32%  COMPARED TO  71.64%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE LOAN-TO-DEPOSIT RATIO OF OUR PEERS WAS  82.00%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE TOTAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND INTEREST-EARNING DEPOSITS IN OTHER BANKS,  INCREASE  D  2.41%  OR  $11,509,000  TO  $489,441,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , FROM  $477,932,000  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO REFLECTED A NET UNREALIZED  GAIN  OF  $1,309,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO A NET UNREALIZED  LOSS  OF  $6,257,000  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THE BOARD AND MANAGEMENT HAVE HAD PERIODIC DISCUSSIONS ABOUT OUR STRATEGY FOR RISK MANAGEMENT IN DEALING WITH POTENTIAL LOSSES SHOULD INTEREST RATES BEGIN TO RISE.  WE HAVE BEEN MANAGING THE PORTFOLIO WITH AN OBJECTIVE OF MINIMIZING THE RISK OF RISING INTEREST RATES ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OVERALL PORTFOLIO.  WE HAVE RESTRUCTURED THE PORTFOLIO A FEW TIMES BY SELLING OFF SECURITIES AND INVESTING IN VARIABLE RATE SECURITIES WITH SHORTER DURATION.  THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY EVALUATES EACH INVESTMENT SECURITY FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, RELYING PRIMARILY ON INDUSTRY ANALYST REPORTS, OBSERVATION OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS.  THE PORTION OF THE IMPAIRMENT THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A SHORTAGE IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATIVE TO THE AMORTIZED COST SHOULD BE RECORDED AS A CURRENT PERIOD CHARGE TO EARNINGS.  THE DISCOUNT RATE IN THIS ANALYSIS IS THE ORIGINAL YIELD EXPECTED AT TIME OF PURCHASE.  MANAGEMENT EVALUATED ALL AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES WITH AN UNREALIZED LOSS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND IDENTIFIED THOSE THAT HAD AN UNREALIZED LOSS FOR AT LEAST A CONSECUTIVE 12 MONTH PERIOD, WHICH HAD AN UNREALIZED LOSS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  GREATER THAN 10% OF THE RECORDED BOOK VALUE ON THAT DATE, OR WHICH HAD AN UNREALIZED LOSS OF MORE THAN $10,000.  MANAGEMENT ALSO ANALYZED ANY SECURITIES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DOWNGRADED BY CREDIT RATING AGENCIES.  FOR THOSE SECURITIES THAT MET THE EVALUATION CRITERIA, MANAGEMENT OBTAINED AND REVIEWED THE MOST RECENTLY PUBLISHED NATIONAL CREDIT RATINGS FOR THOSE SECURITIES.  FOR THOSE SECURITIES THAT WERE OBLIGATIONS OF STATES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS WITH AN INVESTMENT GRADE RATING BY THE RATING AGENCIES, THE COMPANY ALSO EVALUATED THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE MUNICIPALITY AND ANY APPLICABLE MUNICIPAL BOND INSURANCE PROVIDER AND CONCLUDED THERE WERE NO OTTI LOSSES RECORDED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  .  THERE WERE NO OTTI LOSSES RECORDED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HELD  SIX  U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES OF WHICH  FOUR  WERE IN A LOSS POSITION FOR LESS THAN 12 MONTHS AND  TWO  HAD BEEN IN A LOSS POSITION FOR 12 MONTHS OR MORE.  THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ON THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENTS IN DIRECT OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WERE CAUSED BY INTEREST RATE CHANGES.  THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THOSE INVESTMENTS DO NOT PERMIT THE ISSUER TO SETTLE THE SECURITIES AT A PRICE LESS THAN THE AMORTIZED COSTS OF THE INVESTMENT.  BECAUSE THE DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND NOT CREDIT QUALITY, AND BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD, AND IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT IT WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL THOSE INVESTMENTS UNTIL A RECOVERY OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH MAY BE THE MATURITY DATE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER THOSE INVESTMENTS TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AT  MARCH 31, 2019.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HELD  55  OBLIGATIONS OF STATES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISION SECURITIES OF WHICH  NONE  WERE IN A LOSS POSITION FOR LESS THAN 12 MONTHS AND  ONE  HAD BEEN IN A LOSS POSITION FOR 12 MONTHS OR MORE.  THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ON THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENTS IN OBLIGATIONS OF STATES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISION SECURITIES WERE CAUSED BY INTEREST RATE CHANGES.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BECAUSE THE DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND NOT CREDIT QUALITY, AND BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO HOLD AND DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL, AND IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT IT WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL THOSE INVESTMENTS UNTIL A RECOVERY OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH MAY BE MATURITY, THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER THOSE INVESTMENTS TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AT MARCH 31, 2019.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HELD  132  U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTITY AND AGENCY SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS OF WHICH  21  WERE IN A LOSS POSITION FOR LESS THAN 12 MONTHS AND  45  HAVE BEEN IN A LOSS POSITION FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS.  THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ON THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENTS IN U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTITIES AND AGENCIES COLLATERALIZED BY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS WERE CAUSED BY INTEREST RATE CHANGES.  THE CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS OF THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE GUARANTEED BY AN AGENCY OR SPONSORED ENTITY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.  ACCORDINGLY, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE SECURITIES WOULD NOT BE SETTLED AT A PRICE LESS THAN THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT.  BECAUSE THE DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND NOT CREDIT QUALITY, AND BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO HOLD AND DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL, AND IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT IT WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL THOSE INVESTMENTS UNTIL A RECOVERY OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH MAY BE MATURITY, THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER THOSE INVESTMENTS TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AT  MARCH 31, 2019.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD A TOTAL OF  36  PRIVATE LABEL MORTGAGE AND ASSET BACKED SECURITIES (PLMABS) WITH A REMAINING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF  $126,872,000  AND A NET UNREALIZED  GAIN  OF APPROXIMATELY  $245,000.  SIX  OF THE PLMABS SECURITIES WERE IN A LOSS POSITION FOR LESS THAN 12 MONTHS AND  17  HAVE BEEN IN LOSS FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  .

THIS LEVEL OF CONCENTRATION OF COMMERCIAL LOANS AND LOANS COLLATERALIZED BY REAL ESTATE IS CONSISTENT WITH  95.8%  OF TOTAL LOANS AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE LOANS WITHIN THIS CONCENTRATION HAVE NO MORE THAN THE NORMAL RISK OF COLLECTIBILITY, A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ECONOMY IN GENERAL OR A DECLINE IN REAL ESTATE VALUES IN OUR PRIMARY MARKET AREAS, IN PARTICULAR, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON COLLECTIBILITY, INCREASE THE LEVEL OF REAL ESTATE-RELATED NON-PERFORMING LOANS, OR HAVE OTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS WHICH ALONE OR IN THE AGGREGATE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.  THE COMPANY WAS NOT INVOLVED IN ANY SUB-PRIME MORTGAGE LENDING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  OR TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  OR  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOAN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND PRACTICES RESULT IN PRUDENT EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT, BUT RECOGNIZE THAT OUR LENDING ACTIVITIES RESULT IN RELATIVELY HIGH REPORTED COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LENDING LEVELS.  COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS INCLUDE CERTAIN LOANS WHICH REPRESENT LOW TO MODERATE RISK AND CERTAIN LOANS WITH HIGHER RISKS.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEW AND APPROVE CONCENTRATION LIMITS AND EXCEPTIONS TO LIMITATIONS OF CONCENTRATION ARE REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT LEAST QUARTERLY.  NONPERFORMING ASSETS  NONPERFORMING ASSETS CONSIST OF NONPERFORMING LOANS, OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED (OREO), AND REPOSSESSED ASSETS.

OREO IS INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL AND THEREAFTER CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE, LESS SELLING COSTS.  WE HAD NO OREO PROPERTIES AT  MARCH 31, 2019  OR  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE COMPANY HELD  NO  REPOSSESSED ASSETS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  OR  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES MADE UP OF GENERAL AND SPECIFIC ALLOCATIONS.  THE METHODOLOGY IS SET FORTH IN A FORMAL POLICY AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE NEED FOR AN OVERALL  46  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AS WELL AS SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES THAT ARE TIED TO INDIVIDUAL LOANS.  THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S LOAN PORTFOLIO.  THE ALLOWANCE CONSISTS OF TWO PRIMARY COMPONENTS, SPECIFIC RESERVES RELATED TO IMPAIRED LOANS AND GENERAL RESERVES FOR PROBABLE INCURRED LOSSES RELATED TO LOANS THAT ARE NOT IMPAIRED.  FOR ALL PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS, THE DETERMINATION OF THE GENERAL RESERVE FOR LOANS THAT ARE NOT IMPAIRED IS BASED ON ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CONSIDERATION OF HISTORICAL LOSSES BY PORTFOLIO SEGMENT (AND IN CERTAIN CASES PEER LOSS DATA) OVER THE MOST RECENT  20  QUARTERS, AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS INCLUDING ECONOMIC TRENDS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S SERVICE AREAS, INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND TRENDS, GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS, ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUES, THE COMPANY\u2019S UNDERWRITING POLICIES, THE CHARACTER OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO, AND PROBABLE LOSSES INCURRED IN THE PORTFOLIO TAKEN AS A WHOLE.  MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE MOST RECENT  20  QUARTERS WAS AN APPROPRIATE LOOK BACK PERIOD BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND VARIOUS NATIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS, AND A TIME PERIOD SUFFICIENT TO CAPTURE ENOUGH DATA DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE PORTFOLIO TO PRODUCE STATISTICALLY ACCURATE HISTORICAL LOSS CALCULATIONS.  WE BELIEVE THIS PERIOD IS AN APPROPRIATE LOOK BACK PERIOD.  IN ORIGINATING LOANS, WE RECOGNIZE THAT LOSSES WILL BE EXPERIENCED AND THAT THE RISK OF LOSS WILL VARY WITH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TYPE OF LOAN BEING MADE, THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER OVER THE TERM OF THE LOAN, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND, IN THE CASE OF A SECURED LOAN, THE QUALITY OF THE COLLATERAL SECURING THE LOAN.  THE ALLOWANCE IS INCREASED BY PROVISIONS CHARGED AGAINST EARNINGS AND RECOVERIES, AND REDUCED BY NET LOAN CHARGE OFFS.  LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE, OR PARTIALLY CHARGED OFF WHEN PORTIONS OF A LOAN ARE DEEMED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE.  RECOVERIES ARE GENERALLY RECORDED ONLY WHEN CASH PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED.  THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS MAINTAINED TO COVER PROBABLE INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO.  THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE REVIEW OF OUR ASSETS AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE ADEQUACY LIES WITH MANAGEMENT AND OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE.  THEY DELEGATE THE AUTHORITY TO THE  CHIEF CREDIT OFFICER (CCO) TO DETERMINE THE LOSS RESERVE RATIO FOR EACH TYPE OF ASSET AND TO REVIEW, AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF THE PORTFOLIO, PAST EXPERIENCE, PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, AMOUNT OF GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES, CONCENTRATION IN LOAN TYPES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS.  THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS AN ESTIMATE OF THE PROBABLE INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO.  THE ALLOWANCE IS BASED ON PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTING: (I) LOSSES ACCRUED FOR ON LOANS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE OF OCCURRING AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND (II) LOSSES ACCRUED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL, PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE SECONDARY MARKET AND THE LOAN BALANCE.  MANAGEMENT ADHERES TO AN INTERNAL ASSET REVIEW SYSTEM AND LOSS ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FOR TIMELY RECOGNITION OF PROBLEM ASSETS AND ADEQUATE VALUATION ALLOWANCES TO COVER PROBABLE INCURRED LOSSES.  THE BANK\u2019S ASSET MONITORING PROCESS INCLUDES THE USE OF ASSET CLASSIFICATIONS TO SEGREGATE THE ASSETS, LARGELY LOANS AND REAL ESTATE, INTO VARIOUS RISK CATEGORIES.  THE BANK USES THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSIFICATIONS AS A MEANS OF MEASURING RISK AND DETERMINING THE ADEQUACY OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES BY USING A NINE-GRADE SYSTEM TO CLASSIFY ASSETS.  IN GENERAL, ALL CREDIT FACILITIES EXCEEDING 90 DAYS OF DELINQUENCY REQUIRE CLASSIFICATION AND ARE PLACED ON NONACCRUAL.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AT THE DATES AND FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.  FOR THE QUARTER  ENDED MARCH 31,  FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  FOR THE QUARTER  ENDED MARCH 31,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  2018  BALANCE, BEGINNING OF PERIOD  $9,104  $8,778  $8,778  (REVERSAL OF) PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  (25  )  50  \u2014  LOSSES CHARGED TO ALLOWANCE  (9  )  (210  )  (92  )  RECOVERIES  48  486  102  BALANCE, END OF PERIOD  $9,118  $9,104  $8,788  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO TOTAL LOANS AT END OF PERIOD  0.99%  0.99%  0.96%  MANAGING CREDITS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE RISK EVALUATION METHODOLOGY INCLUDES DEVELOPING A BUSINESS STRATEGY WITH THE CUSTOMER TO MITIGATE OUR LOSSES.  OUR MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO MONITOR THESE CREDITS WITH A VIEW TO IDENTIFYING AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE WHEN, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS MAY BE NECESSARY.  THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED AT LEAST QUARTERLY BY THE BANK\u2019S AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS\u2019 AUDIT COMMITTEE.  RESERVES ARE ALLOCATED TO LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS USING PERCENTAGES WHICH ARE BASED ON BOTH HISTORICAL RISK ELEMENTS SUCH AS DELINQUENCIES AND LOSSES AND PREDICTIVE RISK ELEMENTS SUCH AS ECONOMIC, COMPETITIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS.  WE HAVE ADOPTED THE SPECIFIC RESERVE APPROACH TO ALLOCATE RESERVES TO EACH IMPAIRED ASSET FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTIMATING POTENTIAL LOSS EXPOSURE.  ALTHOUGH THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS PORTFOLIO CATEGORIES, IT IS GENERAL IN NATURE AND AVAILABLE FOR THE LOAN PORTFOLIO IN ITS ENTIRETY.  ADDITIONS MAY BE REQUIRED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF INDEPENDENT LOAN PORTFOLIO EXAMINATIONS, REGULATORY AGENCY EXAMINATIONS, OR OUR OWN INTERNAL REVIEW PROCESS.  ADDITIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED WHEN, IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT, THE RESERVE DOES NOT PROPERLY REFLECT THE POTENTIAL LOSS EXPOSURE.  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE BALANCE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (ALLL) WAS  $9,118,000  COMPARED TO  $9,104,000  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE  INCREASE  WAS DUE TO NET RECOVERIES OFFSET BY REVERSE PROVISION OF  $25,000  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  .  THE BALANCE OF UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT ON CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT WAS  $326,191,000  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $312,274,000  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE BALANCE OF A CONTINGENT ALLOCATION FOR PROBABLE LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE ON UNFUNDED OBLIGATIONS WAS  $250,000  AND  $225,000  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE CONTINGENT ALLOCATION FOR PROBABLE LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE ON UNFUNDED OBLIGATIONS IS CALCULATED BY MANAGEMENT USING APPROPRIATE, SYSTEMATIC, AND CONSISTENTLY APPLIED PROCESSES.  WHILE RELATED TO CREDIT LOSSES, THIS ALLOCATION IS NOT A PART OF THE ALLL AND IS CONSIDERED SEPARATELY AS A LIABILITY FOR ACCOUNTING AND REGULATORY REPORTING PURPOSES.  RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES EXIST IN ALL LENDING TRANSACTIONS AND OUR MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS\u2019 LOAN COMMITTEE HAVE ESTABLISHED RESERVE LEVELS BASED ON ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER RISKS THAT EXIST AS OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE ALLL WAS  0.99%  OF TOTAL GROSS LOANS COMPARED TO  0.99%  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  TOTAL LOANS INCLUDE FLB, SVB AND VCB LOANS THAT WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITIONS, WHICH STOOD AT  $175,177,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  $189,719,000  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  EXCLUDING THESE FLB, SVB AND VCB LOANS FROM THE CALCULATION, THE ALLL TO TOTAL GROSS LOANS WAS  1.22%  AND  1.25%  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY AND GENERAL RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH NON-IMPAIRED LOANS TO TOTAL NON-IMPAIRED LOANS WAS  1.22%  AND  1.25%  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE LOAN PORTFOLIOS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGERS WERE BOOKED AT FAIR VALUE WITH NO ASSOCIATED ALLOCATION IN THE ALLL.  THE SIZE OF THE FAIR VALUE DISCOUNT REMAINS ADEQUATE FOR ALL NON-IMPAIRED ACQUIRED LOANS; THEREFORE, THERE IS NO ASSOCIATED ALLOCATION IN THE ALLL FOR THOSE LOANS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S LOAN PORTFOLIO BALANCES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  INCREASED THROUGH ORGANIC GROWTH.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO TOTAL LOANS RATIO IS DIRECTIONALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPOSITION OF LOANS AND THE LEVEL OF NONPERFORMING AND CLASSIFIED LOANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS EXPERIENCED IN THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES SERVICED BY THE COMPANY AND RECENT IMPROVEMENTS IN REAL ESTATE COLLATERAL VALUES.  ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE COLLATERAL VALUE OF VARIOUS UNDER-PERFORMING LOANS MAY AFFECT THE LEVEL AND ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.  THE ALLOWANCE MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY TRENDS IN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE-OFFS EXPERIENCED OR EXPECTED TRENDS WITHIN DIFFERENT LOAN PORTFOLIOS.  HOWEVER, THE TOTAL RESERVE RATES ON NON-IMPAIRED LOANS INCLUDE QUALITATIVE FACTORS WHICH ARE SYSTEMATICALLY DERIVED AND CONSISTENTLY APPLIED TO REFLECT CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATED LOSSES FROM LOSS CONTINGENCIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  BASED ON THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS AND GIVEN RECENT CHANGES IN HISTORICAL CHARGE-OFF RATES INCLUDED IN THE ALLL MODELING AND THE CHANGES IN OTHER FACTORS, MANAGEMENT DETERMINED THAT THE ALLL WAS APPROPRIATE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  .  HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY MAY NOT SUSTAIN CHARGE-OFFS WHICH ARE IN EXCESS OF THE ALLOWANCE IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES AND SETS FORTH ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS WHICH PORTRAYS THE TRENDS THAT ARE OCCURRING IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO.

TOTAL GOODWILL AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WAS  $53,777,000  CONSISTING OF  $8,934,000  ,  $14,643,000  ,  $6,340,000  ,  $10,394,000  , AND  $13,466,000  REPRESENTING THE EXCESS OF THE COST OF BANK OF MADERA COUNTY, SERVICE 1  ST  BANCORP, VISALIA COMMUNITY BANK, SIERRA VISTA BANK, AND FOLSOM LAKE BANK, RESPECTIVELY, OVER THE NET OF THE AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN THE TRANSACTIONS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.  THE VALUE OF GOODWILL IS ULTIMATELY DERIVED FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO GENERATE NET EARNINGS AFTER THE ACQUISITIONS AND IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES.  THE FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT DURING THE FIRST TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THE ACQUISITION DATE IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE TO INDICATE A MORE ACCURATE OR APPROPRIATE VALUE FOR AN ASSET OR LIABILITY.  A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN NET EARNINGS COULD BE INDICATIVE OF A DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL AND RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT.  FOR THAT REASON, GOODWILL IS ASSESSED AT LEAST ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT.  MANAGEMENT PERFORMED AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 UTILIZING VARIOUS QUALITATIVE FACTORS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE FACTORS ARE SUFFICIENT AND COMPREHENSIVE AND AS SUCH, NO FURTHER FACTORS NEED TO BE ASSESSED AT THIS TIME.  BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S ANALYSIS PERFORMED, NO IMPAIRMENT WAS REQUIRED.  GOODWILL IS ALSO TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.  NO SUCH EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES AROSE DURING THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019.  THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE CORE DEPOSIT RELATIONSHIPS ACQUIRED IN THE 2017 ACQUISITION OF FOLSOM LAKE BANK OF $1,879,000, THE 2016 ACQUISITION OF SIERRA VISTA BANK OF $508,000, AND THE 2013 ACQUISITION OF VISALIA COMMUNITY BANK OF $1,365,000.  CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES ARE BEING AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD (WHICH APPROXIMATES THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD) OVER ESTIMATED LIVES OF FIVE TO  10  YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.  THE CARRYING VALUE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  $2,399,000  , NET OF  $1,353,000  IN ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.  THE CARRYING VALUE AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS  $2,572,000  , NET OF  $1,180,000  ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.  WE EVALUATE THE REMAINING USEFUL LIVES QUARTERLY TO DETERMINE WHETHER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT A REVISION TO THE REMAINING PERIODS OF AMORTIZATION.  BASED ON THE EVALUATION, NO CHANGES TO THE REMAINING USEFUL LIVES WAS REQUIRED IN THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  .  AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED WAS  $174,000  AND  $94,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

REFER TO THE  LIQUIDITY  SECTION BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF FHLB ADVANCES.  49  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CAPITAL  CAPITAL SERVES AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS AND HELPS PROTECT DEPOSITORS AND SHAREHOLDERS AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES.  HISTORICALLY, THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF CAPITAL FOR THE COMPANY HAS BEEN THROUGH RETAINED EARNINGS.  THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY MAINTAINED SUBSTANTIAL LEVELS OF CAPITAL.  THE ASSESSMENT OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY IS DEPENDENT ON SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING ASSET QUALITY, EARNINGS TRENDS, LIQUIDITY AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  MAINTENANCE OF ADEQUATE CAPITAL LEVELS IS INTEGRAL TO PROVIDING STABILITY TO THE COMPANY.  THE COMPANY NEEDS TO MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIAL LEVELS OF REGULATORY CAPITAL TO GIVE IT MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY IN THE CHANGING REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  OUR SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY WAS  $227,455,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $219,738,000  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE  INCREASE  FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  IN SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY IS THE RESULT OF AN  INCREASE  IN RETAINED EARNINGS FROM NET INCOME OF  $5,216,000  , THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS OF  $95,000  , STOCK ISSUED UNDER THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN OF  $80,000  , THE EFFECT OF SHARE BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF  $143,000  , STOCK AWARDED TO EMPLOYEES OF  $100,000  , AND AN  INCREASE  IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) OF  $5,329,000  , OFFSET BY COMMON STOCK CASH DIVIDENDS OF  $1,372,000.  ON JULY 18, 2018, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY APPROVED THE ADOPTION OF A PROGRAM TO EFFECT REPURCHASES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK.  UNDER THE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY MAY REPURCHASE UP TO $10 MILLION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, WHICH REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 3% OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, OR APPROXIMATELY  511,509  SHARES BASED ON THE CLOSING STOCK PRICE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK ON  MARCH 31, 2019  OF  $19.55  .  THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM BEGAN ON JULY 19, 2018 AND WILL END ON JULY 18, 2019.  THE SHARES WILL BE REPURCHASED IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS THROUGH BROKERS, SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  145,341  SHARES HAD BEEN REPURCHASED AND RETIRED UNDER THE PROGRAM AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PAID PER SHARE OF  $19.03.  DURING THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  , THE COMPANY DECLARED AND PAID  $1,372,000  IN CASH DIVIDENDS (  $0.10  PER COMMON SHARE) TO HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK.  THE COMPANY DECLARED AND PAID A TOTAL OF $4,270,000 IN CASH DIVIDENDS ($0.31 PER COMMON SHARE) TO HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS PART OF ITS STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS.  THE STRATEGIC PLAN CALLS FOR CONTINUING INCREASES IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND THE CAPITAL REQUIRED MAY THEREFORE BE IN EXCESS OF RETAINED EARNINGS.  THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN CAPITAL IS DEPENDENT UPON THE CAPITAL MARKETS AS WELL AS OUR PERFORMANCE.  MANAGEMENT REGULARLY EVALUATES SOURCES OF CAPITAL AND THE TIMING REQUIRED TO MEET ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.  THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS, THE FDIC AND OTHER FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES HAVE ISSUED RISK-BASED CAPITAL ADEQUACY  GUIDELINES INTENDED TO PROVIDE A MEASURE OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY THAT REFLECTS THE DEGREE OF RISK ASSOCIATED WITH A BANKING  ORGANIZATION\u2019S OPERATIONS FOR BOTH TRANSACTIONS REPORTED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS ASSETS, AND TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS LETTERS OF  CREDIT AND RECOURSE ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH ARE REPORTED AS OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS.  50  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE COMPANY\u2019S REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.

THE COMPANY SUCCEEDED TO ALL OF THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE SERVICE 1  ST  CAPITAL TRUST I, A DELAWARE BUSINESS TRUST, IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF SERVICE 1  ST  AS OF NOVEMBER 12, 2008.  THE TRUST WAS FORMED ON AUGUST 17, 2006 FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF ISSUING TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY SERVICE 1  ST  .  UNDER APPLICABLE REGULATORY GUIDANCE, THE AMOUNT OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES THAT IS ELIGIBLE AS TIER 1 CAPITAL IS LIMITED TO 25% OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TIER 1 CAPITAL ON A PRO FORMA BASIS.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , ALL OF THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED QUALIFY AS TIER 1 CAPITAL.  THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES MATURE ON OCTOBER 7, 2036, ARE REDEEMABLE AT THE COMPANY\u2019S OPTION BEGINNING FIVE YEARS AFTER ISSUANCE, AND REQUIRE QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS BY THE TRUST TO THE HOLDER OF THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AT A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE WHICH WILL ADJUST QUARTERLY TO EQUAL THE THREE MONTH LIBOR PLUS 1.60%.  THE TRUST USED THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES TO PURCHASE APPROXIMATELY $5,155,000 IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SERVICE 1  ST  \u2019S JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES (THE NOTES).  THE NOTES BEAR INTEREST AT THE SAME VARIABLE INTEREST RATE DURING THE SAME QUARTERLY PERIODS AS THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES.  THE NOTES ARE REDEEMABLE BY THE COMPANY ON ANY JANUARY 7, APRIL 7, JULY 7, OR OCTOBER 7 ON OR AFTER OCTOBER 7, 2012 OR AT ANY TIME WITHIN 90 DAYS FOLLOWING THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS, SUCH AS: (I) A CHANGE IN THE REGULATORY CAPITAL TREATMENT OF THE NOTES; (II) IN THE EVENT THE TRUST IS DEEMED AN INVESTMENT COMPANY; OR (III) UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN ADVERSE TAX EVENTS.  IN EACH SUCH CASE, THE COMPANY MAY REDEEM THE NOTES FOR THEIR AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, PLUS ANY ACCRUED BUT UNPAID INTEREST.  THE NOTES MAY BE DECLARED IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE AT THE ELECTION OF THE TRUSTEE OR HOLDERS OF 25% OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUTSTANDING NOTES IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY DEFAULTS IN THE PAYMENT OF ANY INTEREST  51  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOLLOWING THE NONPAYMENT OF ANY SUCH INTEREST FOR 20 OR MORE CONSECUTIVE QUARTERLY PERIODS.  HOLDERS OF THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES ARE ENTITLED TO A CUMULATIVE CASH DISTRIBUTION ON THE LIQUIDATION AMOUNT OF $1,000 PER SECURITY.  FOR EACH JANUARY 7, APRIL 7, JULY 7 OR OCTOBER 7 OF EACH YEAR, THE RATE WILL BE ADJUSTED TO EQUAL THE THREE MONTH LIBOR PLUS 1.60%.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE RATE WAS  4.39%.  LIQUIDITY  LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT INVOLVES OUR ABILITY TO MEET CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS ARISING FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN DEPOSIT LEVELS AND DEMANDS OF DAILY OPERATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE FUNDING OF SECURITIES PURCHASES, PROVIDING FOR CUSTOMERS\u2019 CREDIT NEEDS AND ONGOING REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS.  OUR LIQUIDITY IS ACTIVELY MANAGED ON A DAILY BASIS AND REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY OUR MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTOR\u2019S ASSET/LIABILITY COMMITTEES.  THIS PROCESS IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THE MAINTENANCE OF SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO MEET OUR NEEDS, INCLUDING ADEQUATE CASH FLOW FOR OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE DERIVED FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES WHICH INCLUDE THE ACCEPTANCE OF CUSTOMER AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, BROKER DEPOSITS, FEDERAL FUNDS FACILITIES WITH CORRESPONDENT BANKS, AND ADVANCES FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO.  THESE FUNDING SOURCES ARE AUGMENTED BY PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON LOANS, THE ROUTINE MATURITIES AND PAY DOWNS OF SECURITIES FROM THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, THE STABILITY OF OUR CORE DEPOSITS AND THE ABILITY TO SELL INVESTMENT SECURITIES.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD UNPLEDGED SECURITIES TOTALING  $415,303,000  AVAILABLE AS A SECONDARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY AND TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $32,235,000  .  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  INCREASE  D  1.60%  COMPARED TO  $31,727,000  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  PRIMARY USES OF FUNDS INCLUDE WITHDRAWAL OF AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON DEPOSITS, ORIGINATIONS AND PURCHASES OF LOANS, PURCHASES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, AND PAYMENT OF OPERATING EXPENSES.  AS A MEANS OF AUGMENTING OUR LIQUIDITY, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED FEDERAL FUNDS LINES WITH OUR CORRESPONDENT BANKS.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR AVAILABLE BORROWING CAPACITY INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY  $40,000,000  IN UNSECURED CREDIT LINES WITH OUR CORRESPONDENT BANKS,  $287,839,000  IN UNUSED FHLB ADVANCES AND A  $3,551,000  SECURED CREDIT LINE AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK.  WE BELIEVE OUR LIQUIDITY SOURCES TO BE STABLE AND ADEQUATE.

SUCH DISCUSSION REPRESENTS ONLY THE BEST PRESENT ASSESSMENT OF OUR MANAGEMENT.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A CLINICAL-STAGE, ONCOLOGY THERAPEUTICS COMPANY, TAKING A PRECISION CANCER MEDICINE APPROACH TO DEVELOP DRUGS THAT TARGET MITOSIS (CELL DIVISION) TO TREAT VARIOUS TYPES OF CANCER, INCLUDING LEUKEMIAS, LYMPHOMAS AND SOLID TUMORS. BY INTEGRATING A BIOMARKER STRATEGY INTO OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WE WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS MORE LIKELY TO RESPOND TO TREATMENT.  ON MARCH 15, 2017, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE LICENSED ONVANSERTIB, A PLK1 INHIBITOR, FROM NERVIANO, PURSUANT TO A LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH NERVIANO DATED MARCH 13, 2017. THIS EXCLUSIVE, WORLD-WIDE LICENSE AGREEMENT INCLUDES 3 ISSUED PATENTS FOR ONVANSERTIB WHICH COVER COMPOSITION OF MATTER, SALT FORMS OF ONVANSERTIB AND COMBINATION OF ONVANSERTIB WITH OTHER DRUGS. ONVANSERTIB WAS DEVELOPED TO HAVE HIGH SELECTIVITY TO PLK1 (AT LOW NANOMOLAR IC  50  LEVELS), TO HAVE IDEAL PHARMACOKINETICS, INCLUDING ORAL BIOAVAILABILITY AND ADMINISTRATION AND A DRUG HALF-LIFE OF APPROXIMATELY 24 HOURS, ALLOWING FOR FLEXIBLE DOSING AND SCHEDULING, AND IS WELL TOLERATED AND SAFE WITH ONLY MILD- TO MODERATE SIDE EFFECTS REPORTED TO-DATE. A SAFETY STUDY OF ONVANSERTIB HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED METASTATIC SOLID TUMORS AND PUBLISHED IN 2017 IN  INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUGS.  WE CURRENTLY ARE ENROLLING A PHASE 1B/2 OPEN-LABEL CLINICAL TRIAL OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH STANDARD-OF-CARE CHEMOTHERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH AML. THE PHASE 1B/2 CLINICAL TRIAL IS LED BY HEMATOLOGIST JORGE EDUARDO CORTES, M.D., DEPUTY DEPARTMENT CHAIR, DEPARTMENT OF LEUKEMIA, DIVISION OF CANCER MEDICINE, THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER AND AMER ZEIDAN, MBBS, MHS, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT YALE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, HEMATOLOGY EXPERT AT YALE CANCER CENTER. NINE CLINICAL TRIAL SITES ACROSS THE U.S. ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN THIS TRIAL. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS ENROLLING PATIENTS FOR ITS PHASE 2 OPEN-LABEL CLINICAL TRIAL OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH ABIRATERONE ACETATE (ZYTIGA  \u00ae  ) AND PREDNISONE IN PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC CASTRATION-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER (\u201cMCRPC\u201d). THIS TRIAL IS BEING LED BY DAVID EINSTEIN, M.D., AT THE GENITOURINARY ONCOLOGY PROGRAM AT BIDMC AND HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND, IN ADDITION TO BIDMC, THIS TRIAL IS BEING CONDUCTED AT DFCI AND MGH. IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2019, WE PLAN TO INITIATE A PHASE 1B/2 OPEN-LABEL CLINICAL TRIAL OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH FOLFIRI AND AVASTIN  \u00ae  IN PATIENTS WITH MCRC WITH A KRAS MUTATION. THIS TRIAL WILL BE CONDUCTED AT MAYO CLINIC AND USC NORRIS COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS US TO ANALYZE CTDNA AND CLINICALLY ACTIONABLE MARKERS. UNIQUE TO OUR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN, AND A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR PRECISION CANCER MEDICINE APPROACH, IS THE INTEGRATION OF PREDICTIVE CLINICAL BIOMARKERS TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS MOST LIKELY TO RESPOND TO TREATMENT.  ONVANSERTIB IS A FIRST-IN-CLASS, 3  RD  GENERATION, ORAL AND HIGHLY-SELECTIVE PLK1 INHIBITOR WITH APPARENT ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY IN DIFFERENT PRE-CLINICAL MODELS. POLO-LIKE KINASE FAMILY CONSISTS OF 5 MEMBERS (PLK1-PLK5) AND THEY ARE INVOLVED IN MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS IN CELL DIVISION, INCLUDING THE REGULATION OF CENTROSOME MATURATION, CHECKPOINT RECOVERY, SPINDLE ASSEMBLY, CYTOKINESIS, APOPTOSIS AND MANY OTHERS. PLK1 IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF GENOMIC STABILITY DURING CELL DIVISION. THE OVER-EXPRESSION OF PLK1 CAN LEAD TO IMMATURE CELL DIVISION FOLLOWED BY ANEUPLOIDY AND CELL DEATH, A HALLMARK OF CANCER. PLK1 IS OVER-EXPRESSED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF LEUKEMIAS/LYMPHOMAS AND SOLID TUMOR CANCERS, INCLUDING ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA, NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA, PROSTATE, LUNG, BREAST, OVARIAN, COLORECTAL AND ADRENOCORTICAL CARCINOMA. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT OVER-EXPRESSION OF PLK1 IS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR PROGNOSIS. BLOCKING THE EXPRESSION OF PLK1 BY KINASE INHIBITORS, SUCH AS ONVANSERTIB, CAN EFFECTIVELY INHIBIT GROWTH OF, AND INDUCE, TUMOR CELL DEATH.  STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT INHIBITION OF POLO-LIKE-KINASES CAN LEAD TO TUMOR CELL DEATH, INCLUDING A PHASE 2 STUDY IN ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA (\u201cAML\u201d) WHERE RESPONSE RATES WITH A PRIOR PLK INHIBITOR OF UP TO 31% WERE OBSERVED WHEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A STANDARD THERAPY FOR AML (LOW-DOSE CYTARABINE (\u201cLDAC\u201d)) VERSUS A 13.3% RESPONSE RATE WITH LDAC ALONE. WE BELIEVE THE MORE SELECTIVE NATURE OF ONVANSERTIB TO PLK1, ITS 24-HOUR HALF-LIFE AND ORAL BIOAVAILABILITY, AS WELL AS ITS DEMONSTRATED SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY, WITH ONLY MILD- TO MODERATE SIDE EFFECTS REPORTED, MAY PROVE USEFUL IN ADDRESSING CLINICAL THERAPEUTIC NEEDS ACROSS A VARIETY OF CANCERS.  ONVANSERTIB HAS BEEN TESTED IN-VIVO IN DIFFERENT XENOGRAFT AND TRANSGENIC MODELS SUGGESTING TUMOR GROWTH INHIBITION OR TUMOR REGRESSION WHEN USED IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER THERAPIES. ONVANSERTIB HAS BEEN TESTED FOR ANTIPROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITY ON A PANEL OF 148 TUMOR CELL LINES AND APPEARED HIGHLY ACTIVE WITH AN IC  50  (A MEASURE CONCENTRATION FOR 50% TARGET INHIBITION) BELOW 100 NM IN 75 CELL LINES AND IC  50  VALUES BELOW 1 UM IN 133 OUT OF 148 CELL LINES. ONVANSERTIB ALSO APPEARS ACTIVE IN CELLS EXPRESSING MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT (\u201cMDR\u201d) TRANSPORTER PROTEINS AND WE BELIEVE ITS APPARENT ABILITY TO OVERCOME THE MDR TRANSPORTER RESISTANCE MECHANISM IN CANCER CELLS COULD PROVE USEFUL IN BROADER DRUG COMBINATION APPLICATIONS.  IN IN-VITRO AND IN-VIVO PRE-CLINICAL STUDIES, SYNERGY (INTERACTION OF DISCRETE DRUGS SUCH THAT THE TOTAL EFFECT IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE INDIVIDUAL EFFECTS) HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WITH ONVANSERTIB WHEN USED IN COMBINATION WITH NUMEROUS DIFFERENT CHEMOTHERAPIES, INCLUDING CISPLATIN, CYTARABINE, DOXORUBICIN, GEMCITABINE AND PACLITAXEL, AS WELL AS TARGETED THERAPEUTICS, SUCH AS ABIRATERONE ACETATE (ZYTIGA  \u00ae  ), HISTONE DEACETYLASE (\u201cHDAC\u201d) INHIBITORS, SUCH AS BELINOSTAT (BELEODAQ  \u00ae  ), QUIZARTINIB (AC220), A DEVELOPMENT STAGE FLT3 INHIBITOR, AND BORTEZOMIB (VELCADE  \u00ae  ). THESE THERAPIES ARE USED CLINICALLY FOR THE TREATMENT OF LEUKEMIAS, LYMPHOMAS AND SOLID TUMOR CANCERS, INCLUDING AML, NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA (\u201cNHL\u201d), MCRPC, MCRC, AND TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER (\u201cTNBC\u201d).  WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON ADVANCING OUR TWO ACTIVE CLINICAL TRIALS WITH ONVANSERTIB AND TO INITIATING OUR THIRD TRIAL IN 2019. WE HAVE ACHIEVED A NUMBER OF KEY MILESTONES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND ANTICIPATE ACHIEVING THE FOLLOWING MILESTONES THROUGHOUT 2019.  PHASE 1B/2 TRIAL OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH EITHER LOW-DOSE CYTARABINE OR DECITABINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA.  \u2022  COMPLETE PHASE 1B DOSE ESCALATION COHORTS AND IDENTIFY THE RECOMMENDED PHASE 2 DOSE (\u201cRP2D\u201d) FOR THE PHASE 2 CONTINUATION TRIAL (DEPENDENT UPON THE NUMBER OF DOSE ESCALATION COHORTS REQUIRED TO REACH THE MAXIMUM TOLERATED DOSE OR RP2D OF ONVANSERTIB).  \u2022  PROVIDE TOPLINE SAFETY AND EFFICACY DATA ON THE COMBINATION OF ONVANSERTIB + LDAC AND THE COMBINATION OF ONVANSERTIB + DECITABINE IN PATIENTS TREATED THROUGH THE END OF 2018.  \u2022  PRESENT DATA FROM THE AML TRIAL AT KEY ONCOLOGY CONFERENCES, INCLUDING THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEMATOLOGY (\u201cASH\u201d) ANNUAL MEETING.  \u2022  INITIATE THE PHASE 2 SEGMENT OF THE AML TRIAL, WHICH WILL ENROLL APPROXIMATELY 32 PATIENTS, FOR CONTINUED EVALUATION OF SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH EITHER LDAC OR DECITABINE (PROVIDED THE RP2D HAS BEEN DETERMINED IN PHASE 1B).  PHASE 2 TRIAL OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH ABIRATERONE ACETATE (ZYTIGA  \u00ae  ) AND PREDNISONE FOR THE TREATMENT OF METASTATIC CASTRATION-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  PRESENTED DATA FROM THE MCRPC TRIAL AT THE GENITOURINARY CANCERS SYMPOSIUM (\u201cASCO-GU\u201d) IN FEBRUARY 2019.  \u2022  COMPLETE ENROLLMENT AND EVALUATION OF THE 3 SAFETY LEAD-IN PATIENTS IN THE SECOND ARM (2-WEEK DOSING SCHEDULE) WITH ONVANSERTIB AT 24 MG/M  2  IN COMBINATION WITH ABIRATERONE ACETATE (ZYTIGA  \u00ae  ) AND PREDNISONE.  \u2022  PROVIDE TOPLINE PRELIMINARY SAFETY AND EFFICACY DATA OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH ABIRATERONE ACETATE (ZYTIGA  \u00ae  ) AND PREDNISONE IN PATIENTS TREATED.  \u2022  PRESENT DATA FROM THE MCRPC TRIAL AT KEY ONCOLOGY CONFERENCES THROUGHOUT 2019 AND FIRST QUARTER 2020.  DURING 2019, WE HAVE ADVANCED OUR BUSINESS WITH THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES.  \u2022  ANNOUNCED DATA DEMONSTRATING SIGNIFICANT SYNERGY OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH VENETOCLAX IN CELL MODEL OF VENETOCLAX-RESISTANT AML.  ON APRIL 23, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED PRECLINICAL DATA THAT EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF COMBINING ONVANSERTIB WITH VENETOCLAX IN AN AML CELL MODEL KNOWN TO BE RESISTANT TO VENETOCLAX (VENCLEXTA  \u00ae  - ABBVIE). THIS COMBINATION DEMONSTRATED SYNERGY (THE COMBINED EFFECT OF THE TWO DRUGS IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL EFFECTS) WITH A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN TUMOR CELL VIABILITY. THIS DATA PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR CLINICAL EVALUATION OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH VENETOCLAX IN PATIENTS WITH DIFFICULT-TO-TREAT RELAPSED/REFRACTORY AML, FOR WHICH THERE ARE LIMITED TREATMENT OPTIONS AND THE PROGNOSIS IS POOR.  \u2022  ANNOUNCED UPDATE TO PHASE 1B/2 TRIAL DATA PRESENTED AT AACR - ADDITIONAL PATIENTS ACHIEVE COMPLETE RESPONSE AT TWO HIGHEST DOSE LEVELS OF ONVANSERTIB.  ON APRIL 5, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED AN UPDATE TO OUR PHASE 1B/2 TRIAL DATA PRESENTED AT AACR ON APRIL 1, SHOWING ADDITIONAL PATIENTS HAVING ACHIEVED COMPLETE RESPONSE AT THE TWO HIGHEST DOSE LEVELS OF ONVANSERTIB. A COMPLETE RESPONSE (2 CR\u2019S AND 1 CRI) WAS ACHIEVED IN 3 OF 6 (50%) OF EVALUABLE PATIENTS AT THE HIGHEST DOSES (27MG/M  2  AND 40 MG/M  2  ) OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH STANDARD-OF-CARE DECITABINE. APPROXIMATELY 90% CLINICAL BENEFIT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED (CR + PR + SD). NO DOSE-LIMITING TOXICITIES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED TO-DATE.  \u2022  ANNOUNCED EARLY DATA FROM PHASE 2 TRIAL INDICATES ACTIVITY OF ONVANSERTIB IN PROSTATE CANCER PATIENTS SHOWING INITIAL RESISTANCE TO ANTI-ANDROGEN THERAPY.  ON APRIL 2, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED EARLY DATA FROM OUR ONGOING PHASE 2 STUDY EVALUATING ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH ZYTIGA  \u00ae  IN PATIENTS WITH MCRPC. EARLY PROSTATE SPECIFIC ANTIGEN (\u201cPSA\u201d) RESPONSE WAS OBSERVED WHEN ONVANSERTIB IS ADDED TO ABIRATERONE (ZYTIGA  \u00ae  ) IN 2 OF 6 PATIENTS TO-DATE; THE FIRST PATIENT ACHIEVED THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT OF DISEASE STABILIZATION. THE PSA TRAJECTORY IN THE PATIENT ACHIEVING THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT INDICATES ALTERATION OF THE NATURAL HISTORY OF EARLY SIGNS OF RESISTANCE TO ZYTIGA  \u00ae  . PATIENTS WITH OBSERVED REPONSES TO-DATE HARBOR THE HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR VARIANT (AR-V7) WHICH IS KNOWN TO BE RESISTANT TO TREATMENT WITH ZYTIGA  \u00ae.  \u2022  ANNOUNCED PHASE 1B/2 DOSE ESCALATION TRIAL OF ONVANSERTIB IN RELAPSED/REFRACTORY AML DEMONSTRATES SAFETY, TOLERABILITY AND RELATIVE DURABILITY WITH COMPLETE RESPONSES AT HIGHEST DOSE LEVELS.  ON APRIL 1, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED THE PRESENTATION OF NEW DATA FROM OUR ONGOING PHASE 1B/2 STUDY EVALUATING ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH STANDARD-OF-CARE CHEMOTHERAPY IN AML. THE GREATEST ANTI-LEUKEMIC ACTIVITY HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN THE ONVANSERTIB + DECITABINE ARM, WITH COMPLETE RESPONSE IN 2 (1 CR AND 1 CRI) OF 4 (50%) OF EVALUABLE PATIENTS FROM THE TWO HIGHEST DOSE LEVELS. THERE HAVE BEEN NO DOSE-LIMITING TOXICITIES OBSERVED TO-DATE AND TWO-THIRDS OF PATIENTS HAVE COMPLETED \u22652 CYCLES OF TREATMENT, WITH 2 PATIENTS CURRENTLY ON TREATMENT FOR MORE THAN 11 AND 5 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY. THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION OBSERVED BETWEEN BIOMARKER-POSITIVE PATIENTS AND RESPONSE TO ONVANSERTIB TREATMENT.  \u2022  ANNOUNCED PRESENTATION UPDATE ON PHASE 2 STUDY OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH ZYTIGA  \u00ae  IN PATIENTS WITH MCRPC AT ASCO-GU.  ON FEBRUARY 14, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED AN UPDATE ON OUR PHASE 2 STUDY OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH ZYTIGA  \u00ae  IN PATIENTS WITH MCRPC WAS PRESENTED AT THE GENITOURINARY CANCERS SYMPOSIUM. THE DATA PRESENTED CONFIRMED THE SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY OF THE COMBINATION AND THE EXPANSION OF THE TRIAL TO INCLUDE AN ALTERNATE DOSING SCHEDULE TO MAXIMIZE OBSERVED CLINICAL ACTIVITY.  \u2022  ENTERED AGREEMENT WITH POC CAPITAL, LLC TO FUND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF ONVANSERTIB IN MCRC.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON JANUARY 29, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT WITH POC CAPITAL, LLC, TO FUND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF ONVANSERTIB IN A PHASE1B/2 CLINICAL TRIAL IN PATIENTS WITH MCRC. WE SUBMITTED AN INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION AND PROTOCOL TO THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) ON DECEMBER 19, 2018, AND RECEIVED A \u201cSTUDY MAY PROCEED\u201d NOTIFICATION FROM THE FDA, 28-DAYS LATER, ON JANUARY 16, 2019. THE TRIAL WILL BE CONDUCTED AT TWO PRESTIGIOUS CANCER CENTERS IN THE U.S.; USC NORRIS COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER AND THE MAYO CLINIC.  \u2022  ANNOUNCED NEW PATENT ISSUED FOR COMBINATION OF ONVANSERTIB WITH ANTI-ANDROGEN DRUGS TO TREAT NON-METASTATIC AND METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER.  ON JANUARY 23, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED THE ISSUANCE OF A NEW PATENT (10,155,006), ENTITLED  COMBINATION THERAPIES AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF FOR TREATING CANCER,  BY THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (\u201cUSPTO\u201d). THIS PATENT BROADENS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED PATENT (9,566,280), BY EXPANDING THE USE OF ONVANSERTIB TO ENCOMPASS COMBINATION THERAPIES WITH ANY ANTI-ANDROGEN AND ANDROGEN ANTAGONIST DRUG, SUCH AS ZYTIGA  \u00ae  , XTANDI  \u00ae  AND ERLEADA  \u00ae  FOR THE TREATMENT OF METASTATIC AND NON-METASTATIC CASTRATE-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER.  OUR ACCUMULATED DEFICIT THROUGH  MARCH 31, 2019  IS  $196,370,315  . TO DATE, WE HAVE GENERATED MINIMAL REVENUES AND EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LOSSES TO PERFORM FURTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.  OUR DRUG DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE IN THEIR EARLY STAGES, AND WE CANNOT MAKE ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS OR THE TIME THAT OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WILL TAKE TO COMPLETE, OR THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REVENUES RELATED TO THE SALE OF OUR DRUGS. THE RISK OF COMPLETION OF ANY PROGRAM IS HIGH BECAUSE OF THE MANY UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING NEW DRUG CANDIDATES TO MARKET, INCLUDING THE LONG DURATION OF CLINICAL TESTING, THE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF PROPOSED PRODUCTS UNDER STRINGENT CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOLS, EXTENDED REGULATORY APPROVAL AND REVIEW CYCLES, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, THE NATURE AND TIMING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, AND COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES BEING DEVELOPED BY ORGANIZATIONS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RESOURCES.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  FINANCIAL REPORTING RELEASE NO. 60 REQUIRES ALL COMPANIES TO INCLUDE A DISCUSSION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  REVENUES  OUR TOTAL REVENUES WERE  $161,958  AND  $100,136  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPONENTS OF OUR REVENUES WERE AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  INCREASE (DECREASE)  ROYALTIES  $62,021  $49,055  $12,966  SERVICES AND OTHER  99,937  51,081  48,856  TOTAL REVENUES  $161,958  $100,136  $61,822  THE INCREASE IN ROYALTY INCOME RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE HIGHER ACCRUED REVENUE BASED ON HISTORICAL USAGE RATE AND COLLECTABILITY. THE INCREASE IN SERVICE AND OTHER REVENUE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD IS PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM THE SUBLEASE INCOME RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE UPON ADOPTION OF ASC 842 IN 2019, OFFSET BY DECREASE IN SERVICE REVENUE AS A RESULT OF THE DISPOSITION OF OUR CLIA LABORATORY. WE EXPECT OUR ROYALTIES TO FLUCTUATE AS THE  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ROYALTIES ARE SALES-BASED OR USAGE-BASED ROYALTIES ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSE. REVENUE RECOGNITION OF THE ROYALTY DEPENDS ON THE TIMING AND OVERALL SALES ACTIVITIES OF THE LICENSEES.  COST OF REVENUES  OUR TOTAL COST OF REVENUES WAS  $0  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $366,344  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF  2018  . COST OF REVENUES MAINLY RELATES TO THE COSTS OF OUR DIAGNOSTIC SERVICE REVENUES. THE DECREASE IN COST OF REVENUES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF LAST YEAR IS MAINLY DUE TO THE DISPOSITION OF OUR CLIA LABORATORY. WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY COST OF REVENUE FOR 2019 BASED ON OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  INCREASE (DECREASE)  SALARIES AND STAFF COSTS  $403,888  $402,068  $1,820  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  110,081  395,709  (285,628  )  CLINICAL TRIALS, OUTSIDE SERVICES, AND LAB SUPPLIES  1,927,929  849,988  1,077,941  FACILITIES AND OTHER  206,701  236,073  (29,372  )  TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  $2,648,599  $1,883,838  $764,761  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  INCREASE  D BY  $764,761  TO  $2,648,599  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  FROM  $1,883,838  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . THE OVERALL INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASED CLINICAL TRIALS AND OUTSIDE SERVICE COSTS FOR CLINICAL STUDIES RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR LEAD DRUG CANDIDATE, ONVANSERTIB. WE EXPECT AN INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS WE ADVANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ONVANSERTIB.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  INCREASE (DECREASE)  SALARIES AND STAFF COSTS  $522,797  $690,170  $(167,373  )  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  89,986  970,791  (880,805  )  OUTSIDE SERVICES AND PROFESSIONAL FEES  457,832  482,410  (24,578  )  FACILITIES AND OTHER  404,507  361,606  42,901  TOTAL SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  $1,475,122  $2,504,977  $(1,029,855  )  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  DECREASE  D BY  $1,029,855  TO  $1,475,122  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  FROM  $2,504,977  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . THE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF THE DECREASE WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN SALARIES AND STAFF COSTS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. THE DECREASED SALARIES AND STAFF COST WAS DUE TO THE DECREASED HEADCOUNT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018. IN JANUARY 2018, WE GRANTED OUR EMPLOYEES STOCK OPTIONS IN LIEU OF CASH BONUS. THESE IMMEDIATELY VESTED STOCK OPTIONS WERE FULLY EXPENSED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018. WE DID NOT GRANT SIMILAR STOCK OPTION BONUS IN 2019. THEREFORE, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES WERE HIGHER FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF  2019  . ALSO, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, A NON-CASH EXPENSE, WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF OPTIONS GRANTED, FORFEITURES AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTIONS AT THE TIME OF GRANT. OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS MAY INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS IN ORDER TO SUPPORT FUNDRAISING ACTIVITIES AND GENERAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AS WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE  INTEREST INCOME WAS  $64,743  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $21,771  FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF  2018  . THE INCREASE OF INTEREST INCOME IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER MONEY MARKET FUND BALANCE AND HIGHER INTEREST RATE. INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $0  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $24,236  FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF  2018  . THE DECREASE OF INTEREST EXPENSE IS RESULTING FROM PAY-OFF OF OUR EQUIPMENT LINE OF CREDIT.  CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  \u2014  WARRANTS  WE HAVE ISSUED WARRANTS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  \u2014  WARRANTS LIABILITIES WERE REVALUED TO  $42,076  , RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN VALUE OF  $9,761  FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , BASED PRIMARILY UPON THE INCREASE IN OUR STOCK PRICE AS WELL AS THE CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED TERM, VOLATILITY, AND RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES FOR THE EXPECTED TERM. THE INCREASE IN VALUE UPON REMEASUREMENT AT  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS RECORDED AS A LOSS FROM THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  \u2014  WARRANTS IN THE CONDENSED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  NET LOSS  NET LOSS AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  INCREASE (DECREASE)  NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS  $(4,179,100  )  $(4,792,237  )  $(613,137  )  NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE \u2014 BASIC  $(1.02  )  $(6.23  )  $(5.21  )  NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE \u2014 DILUTED  $(1.02  )  $(6.23  )  $(5.21  )  WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING \u2014 BASIC  4,086,561  768,951  3,317,610  WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING \u2014 DILUTED  4,086,561  768,951  3,317,610  THE  $613,137  DECREASE  IN NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES OF  $0.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE  $5.21  DECREASE IN BASIC NET LOSS PER SHARE WAS IMPACTED BY THE DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSE AND THE INCREASE IN BASIC WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM THE SALES OF APPROXIMATELY 1.7 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH PUBLIC AND DIRECT OFFERINGS, THE ISSUANCE OF APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UPON CONVERSION OF SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, AND ISSUANCE OF APPROXIMATELY 0.5 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UPON EXERCISE OF WARRANTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  $11,330,079  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  $3,360,046  , COMPARED TO  $2,856,147  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . OUR USE OF CASH WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF THE NET LOSS OF  $3,904,771  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION OF  $200,067  , DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF  $45,911  , RELEASE OF CLINICAL TRIAL FUNDING COMMITMENT OF  $70,487  , AND THE LOSS FROM THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  \u2014  WARRANTS OF  $9,761  . THE CHANGES IN OUR OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONSISTED OF HIGHER ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND UNBILLED RECEIVABLE, PREPAID EXPENSES, OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS, AND OTHER ASSET, AND A DECREASE IN OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES. AT OUR CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED LEVEL OF OPERATING LOSS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR AN OPERATING CASH OUTFLOW FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $5,274  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $5,100  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , BOTH OF WHICH WERE FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  NET CASH PROVIDED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $3,242,266  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $1,292,641  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . NET CASH PROVIDED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE PRIMARILY FROM THE EXERCISE OF WARRANTS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL OF  $9,051,750  AND  $9,799,947  , RESPECTIVELY.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BASED ON OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PLAN AND ASSUMPTIONS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO FURTHER ADVANCE OUR CLINICAL TRIAL PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT OUR OTHER OPERATIONS. CONSIDERING OUR CURRENT CASH RESOURCES, WE BELIEVE OUR EXISTING RESOURCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR PLANNED OPERATIONS INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE BASED OUR CASH SUFFICIENCY ESTIMATES ON OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PLAN AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY PROVE TO BE WRONG. WE COULD UTILIZE OUR AVAILABLE CAPITAL RESOURCES SOONER THAN WE CURRENTLY EXPECT, AND WE COULD NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS EVEN SOONER THAN CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED.  THESE CIRCUMSTANCES RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND UPON NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE NATURE, COST AND TIMING OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. TO DATE, OUR SOURCES OF CASH HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY LIMITED TO THE SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY ISSUING EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DILUTION. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL WHEN REQUIRED OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY HAVE TO SIGNIFICANTLY DELAY, SCALE BACK OR DISCONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT AND/OR COMMERCIALIZATION OF ONE OR MORE PRODUCT CANDIDATES, ALL OF WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS. WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO (I) SEEK COLLABORATORS FOR PRODUCT CANDIDATES AT AN EARLIER STAGE THAN OTHERWISE WOULD BE DESIRABLE AND ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN MIGHT OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE; OR (II) RELINQUISH OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR PRODUCTS THAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE SEEK TO DEVELOP OR COMMERCIALIZE OURSELVES ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS. WE ARE EVALUATING ALL OPTIONS TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, INCREASE REVENUE, AS WELL AS REDUCE COSTS, IN AN EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION, WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: (1) RAISING CAPITAL THROUGH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EQUITY OFFERINGS; (2) INTRODUCING OPERATION AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES TO BRING IN NEW REVENUE STREAMS; (3) REDUCING OPERATING COSTS BY IDENTIFYING INTERNAL SYNERGIES; OR (4) ENGAGING IN STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS. WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS OUR SPENDING PLANS TO EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY ADDRESS OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

(\u201cAXT\u201d, \u201cTHE COMPANY\u201d, \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cUS,\u201d AND \u201cOUR\u201d REFER TO AXT, INC. AND ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES) IS A WORLDWIDE MATERIALS SCIENCE COMPANY THAT DEVELOPS AND PRODUCES HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPOUND AND SINGLE ELEMENT SEMICONDUCTOR SUBSTRATES, ALSO KNOWN AS WAFERS. OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES PRODUCE AND SELL CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS SOME OF WHICH ARE USED IN OUR SUBSTRATE MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND SOME OF WHICH ARE SOLD TO OTHER COMPANIES.  OUR SUBSTRATE WAFERS ARE USED WHEN A TYPICAL SILICON SUBSTRATE WAFER CANNOT MEET THE PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS OF A SEMICONDUCTOR OR OPTOELECTRONIC DEVICE. THE DOMINANT SUBSTRATES USED IN PRODUCING SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS AND OTHER ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS ARE MADE FROM SILICON. HOWEVER, CERTAIN CHIPS MAY BECOME TOO HOT OR PERFORM THEIR FUNCTION TOO SLOWLY IF SILICON IS USED AS THE BASE MATERIAL.  IN ADDITION, OPTOELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS LED LIGHTING AND CHIP-BASED LASERS, DO NOT USE SILICON SUBSTRATES BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE A WAVE FORM FREQUENCY THAT CANNOT BE ACHIEVED USING SILICON. ALTERNATIVE OR SPECIALTY MATERIALS ARE USED TO REPLACE SILICON AS THE PREFERRED BASE IN THESE SITUATIONS. OUR WAFERS PROVIDE SUCH ALTERNATIVE OR SPECIALTY MATERIALS. WE DO NOT DESIGN OR MANUFACTURE THE CHIPS. WE ADD VALUE BY RESEARCHING, DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING THE SPECIALTY MATERIAL WAFERS. WE HAVE TWO PRODUCT LINES: SPECIALTY MATERIAL SUBSTRATES AND RAW MATERIALS INTEGRAL TO THESE SUBSTRATES. OUR COMPOUND SUBSTRATES COMBINE INDIUM WITH PHOSPHOROUS (INDIUM PHOSPHIDE: INP) OR GALLIUM WITH ARSENIC (GALLIUM ARSENIDE: GAAS). OUR SINGLE ELEMENT SUBSTRATES ARE MADE FROM GERMANIUM (GE).  SEMI-INSULATING GAAS IS USED TO CREATE VARIOUS HIGH SPEED MICROWAVE COMPONENTS, INCLUDING POWER AMPLIFIER CHIPS USED IN CELL PHONES, SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS AND BROADCAST TELEVISION APPLICATIONS.  SEMI-CONDUCTING GAAS SUBSTRATES ARE USED TO CREATE OPTO-ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS, INCLUDING HIGH BRIGHTNESS LIGHT EMITTING DIODES (HBLEDS) THAT ARE OFTEN USED TO BACKLIGHT WIRELESS HANDSETS AND LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY (LCD) TVS AND ALSO USED FOR AUTOMOTIVE PANELS, SIGNAGE, DISPLAY AND LIGHTING APPLICATIONS. A POSSIBLE NEW APPLICATION FOR SEMI-CONDUCTING GAAS IS 3-D SENSING CHIPS USING VCSELS (VERTICAL CAVITY SURFACE EMITTING LASERS) AS AN ARRAY OF LASERS ON A SINGLE CHIP THAT COULD BE USED IN CELL PHONES AND OTHER DEVICES. INP IS A HIGH PERFORMANCE SEMICONDUCTOR SUBSTRATE USED IN BROADBAND AND FIBER OPTIC APPLICATIONS AND DATA CENTER CONNECTIVITY. IN RECENT YEARS, INP DEMAND HAS INCREASED. GE SUBSTRATES ARE USED IN APPLICATIONS SUCH AS SOLAR CELLS FOR SPACE AND TERRESTRIAL PHOTOVOLTAIC APPLICATIONS.  OUR RAW MATERIALS INCLUDE BOTH RAW GALLIUM AND PURIFIED GALLIUM.  WE USE PURIFIED GALLIUM IN PRODUCING OUR GAAS SUBSTRATES AND SELL BOTH RAW GALLIUM AND PURIFIED GALLIUM IN THE OPEN MARKET TO OTHER COMPANIES FOR USE IN PRODUCING MAGNETIC MATERIALS, HIGH TEMPERATURE THERMOMETERS, SINGLE CRYSTAL INGOTS INCLUDING GALLIUM ARSENIDE, GALLIUM NITRIDE, GALLIUM ANTIMONIDE, GALLIUM PHOSPHIDE, AND OTHER MATERIALS AND ALLOYS.  WE ALSO PRODUCE PYROLYTIC BORON NITRIDE (PBN) CRUCIBLES USED IN THE HIGH TEMPERATURE (TYPICALLY IN THE RANGE 500 C TO 1,500 C) GROWTH PROCESS OF SINGLE CRYSTAL INGOTS AND EPITAXIAL LAYER GROWTH IN MBE (MOLECULAR BEAM EPITAXY) REACTORS.  WE USE THESE PBN CRUCIBLES IN OUR OWN INGOT GROWTH PROCESSES AND ALSO SELL THEM IN THE OPEN MARKET TO OTHER COMPANIES. OUR SUBSTRATE PRODUCT GROUP GENERATED 79%, 80% AND 81% OF OUR REVENUE AND OUR RAW MATERIALS PRODUCT GROUP GENERATED 21%, 20% AND 19% FOR 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING CHART SHOWS OUR SUBSTRATE PRODUCTS AND THEIR MATERIALS, DIAMETERS AND ILLUSTRATIVE APPLICATIONS AND SHOWS OUR RAW MATERIALS GROUP PRIMARY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ILLUSTRATIVE USES AND APPLICATIONS.

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN INCLUDES PARTIAL OWNERSHIP OF 7 COMPANIES IN CHINA (SUBSIDIARIES/JOINT VENTURES). WE BELIEVE THIS SUPPLY CHAIN ARRANGEMENT PROVIDES US WITH PRICING ADVANTAGES, RELIABLE SUPPLY, MARKET TREND VISIBILITY AND BETTER SOURCING LEAD-TIMES FOR KEY RAW MATERIALS CENTRAL TO MANUFACTURING OUR SUBSTRATES. OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURE COMPANIES PRODUCE MATERIALS, INCLUDING RAW GALLIUM (4N GA), HIGH PURITY GALLIUM (6N GA), ARSENIC, GERMANIUM, GERMANIUM DIOXIDE, PYROLYTIC BORON NITRIDE (PBN) CRUCIBLES AND BORON OXIDE (B2O3). OUR OWNERSHIP AND THE OWNERSHIP HELD BY OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN THESE COMPANIES RANGE FROM 97% TO 20%. WE HAVE BOARD REPRESENTATION IN ALL 7 OF THESE COMPANIES. WE CONSOLIDATE THE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE HAVE EITHER A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, OR MAJORITY FINANCIAL INTEREST COMBINED WITH THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SUBSTANTIVE CONTROL OVER THE OPERATION OR FINANCIAL DECISIONS MADE BY SUCH COMPANIES. WE USE THE EQUITY METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR COMPANIES IN WHICH WE HAVE SMALLER FINANCIAL INTEREST AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER SUCH COMPANIES. WE PURCHASE PORTIONS OF THE MATERIALS PRODUCED BY THESE COMPANIES FOR OUR OWN USE AND THEY SELL THE REMAINDER OF THEIR PRODUCTION TO THIRD PARTIES.  THE BEIJING CITY GOVERNMENT IS MOVING ITS OFFICES INTO THE AREA WHERE OUR ORIGINAL MANUFACTURING FACILITY IS CURRENTLY LOCATED AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING THOUSANDS OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES INTO THIS AREA. THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONSTRUCTED SHOWCASE TOWER BUILDINGS AND OVERSEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW APARTMENT COMPLEXES, RETAIL STORES AND RESTAURANTS. AN AMUSEMENT PARK IS BEING CONSTRUCTED WITHIN A FEW MILES OF OUR FACILITY. TO CREATE ROOM AND UPGRADE THE DISTRICT, THE CITY INSTRUCTED VIRTUALLY ALL EXISTING MANUFACTURING COMPANIES, INCLUDING AXT, TO RELOCATE ALL OR SOME OF THEIR MANUFACTURING LINES. IN 2018, WE ACHIEVED EVERY MAJOR MILESTONE ESTABLISHED IN OUR RELOCATION PLAN FOR OUR GALLIUM ARSENIDE AND GERMANIUM PRODUCTION LINES. WE INTEND TO SECURE ADDITIONAL PERMITS AND APPROVALS IN 2019. THE NEW FACILITIES ARE INTENDED TO GIVE US THE LONG-TERM CAPACITY AND A NEW LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGICAL SOPHISTICATION IN OUR MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES TO SUPPORT THE MAJOR TRENDS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE LIKELY TO DRIVE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN THE YEARS AHEAD. OUR INDIUM PHOSPHIDE PRODUCTION LINE, AS WELL AS VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE AND SALES FUNCTIONS, WILL REMAIN PRIMARILY AT OUR ORIGINAL SITE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  TO MITIGATE OUR RISKS AND MAINTAIN OUR PRODUCTION SCHEDULE, WE ARE MOVING OUR GALLIUM ARSENIDE EQUIPMENT IN STAGES SO THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE OUR GALLIUM ARSENIDE PRODUCTS AT OUR BEIJING SITE, AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSFER INCREASING VOLUME TO THE NEW SITES. THIS APPROACH WILL ALSO MINIMIZE ANY DISRUPTION TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE INTEND TO COMPLETE THIS RELOCATION IN 2019. IN 2018, WE PROVIDED QUALIFICATION WAFERS AND OUR OWN INTERNAL CHARACTERIZATION DATA FROM THE NEW FACILITIES TO OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF QUALIFYING THE WAFER SUBSTRATES BEFORE PLACING VOLUME PURCHASE ORDERS FOR PRODUCTS FROM THE NEW FACILITIES. THE RELOCATION OF OUR GALLIUM ARSENIDE PRODUCTION LINE REQUIRES US TO CONTINUE TO ACCURATELY EXECUTE OUR RELOCATION PLAN. A FAILURE TO PROPERLY COMPLETE OUR RELOCATION PLAN COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTION TO OUR PRODUCTION AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IF WE FAIL TO MEET THE PRODUCT QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS OF A CUSTOMER, WE MAY LOSE SALES TO THAT CUSTOMER. OUR REPUTATION MAY ALSO BE DAMAGED. ANY LOSS OF SALES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2018, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED A LIST OF THOUSANDS OF CATEGORIES OF GOODS THAT WILL FACE TARIFFS OF 10%.  ALL OF OUR WAFER SUBSTRATES ARE MANUFACTURED IN CHINA AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, APPROXIMATELY 14% OF OUR REVENUE WAS GENERATED BY SALES TO CUSTOMERS IN NORTH AMERICA, PRIMARILY IN THE U.S.  OUR INBOUND PRODUCTS TO THE U.S. ARE NOW SUBJECT TO A 10% TARIFF ASSESSED ON THE CUSTOMS VALUE OF THE GOODS AS IMPORTED BY US, EFFECTIVE APPROXIMATELY SEPTEMBER 24, 2018.  ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE INITIAL IMPACT OF APPROXIMATELY $150,000 PER QUARTER IS MATERIAL, THE FUTURE IMPACT OF TARIFFS AND TRADE WARS IS UNCERTAIN.  THE TARIFFS COULD BE INCREASED TO 25% SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE.  WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RAISE PRICES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF CUSTOMERS AND OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIALLY HARMED.  ADDITIONALLY, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SIGNAL THAT IT MAY ALTER TRADE AGREEMENTS AND TERMS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING LIMITING TRADE WITH CHINA, AND MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TARIFFS ON IMPORTS FROM CHINA.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  WE PREPARE OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAKE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON OUR RESULTS CANNOT BE DETERMINED WITH CERTAINTY, AND ARE MADE BASED UPON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THESE ESTIMATES MAY CHANGE AS NEW EVENTS OCCUR OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS OBTAINED, AND WE MAY PERIODICALLY BE FACED WITH UNCERTAINTIES, THE OUTCOMES OF WHICH ARE NOT WITHIN OUR CONTROL AND MAY NOT BE KNOWN FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME.  WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE POLICIES BELOW AS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MATERIAL TO THE PRESENTATION OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REQUIRE US TO MAKE DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL REPORTS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THEY MAY REQUIRE US TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME OF THE ESTIMATE. DIFFERENT ESTIMATES THAT WE COULD HAVE USED, OR CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATE THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR, MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  WE MANUFACTURE AND SELL HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTOR SUBSTRATES INCLUDING INDIUM PHOSPHIDE, GALLIUM ARSENIDE AND GERMANIUM WAFERS, AND OUR THREE CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES SELL CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS, INCLUDING 99.99% PURE GALLIUM (4N GA), HIGH PURITY GALLIUM (7N GA), PYROLYTIC BORON NITRIDE (PBN) CRUCIBLES AND BORON OXIDE (B2O3). AFTER WE SHIP OUR PRODUCTS, THERE ARE NO REMAINING OBLIGATIONS OR CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD PRECLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION. OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY SOLD PURSUANT TO PURCHASE ORDERS PLACED BY OUR CUSTOMERS, AND OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE DO NOT REQUIRE CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE. WE ACCOUNT FOR A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER WHEN THERE IS A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT, WHICH COULD BE THE CUSTOMER\u2019S PURCHASE ORDER, THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES ARE IDENTIFIED, THE CONTRACT HAS COMMERCIAL TERMS, AND COLLECTIBILITY OF THE CONTRACT CONSIDERATION IS PROBABLE. THE MAJORITY OF OUR CONTRACTS HAVE A SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION TO TRANSFER PRODUCTS AND ARE SHORT TERM IN NATURE, USUALLY LESS THAN SIX MONTHS. OUR REVENUE IS MEASURED BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION SPECIFIED IN THE CONTRACT WITH EACH CUSTOMER IN EXCHANGE FOR TRANSFERRING PRODUCTS THAT ARE GENERALLY BASED UPON A NEGOTIATED, FORMULA, LIST OR FIXED PRICE. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PROMISED GOODS IS TRANSFERRED TO OUR CUSTOMER, WHICH IS EITHER UPON SHIPMENT FROM OUR DOCK, RECEIPT AT THE CUSTOMER\u2019S DOCK, OR REMOVAL FROM CONSIGNMENT INVENTORY AT THE CUSTOMER\u2019S LOCATION, IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE RECORDED AT THE INVOICED AMOUNT AND ARE NOT INTEREST BEARING. WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW THE LIKELIHOOD OF COLLECTION ON OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES AND PROVIDE AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PRIMARILY BASED UPON THE AGE OF THESE ACCOUNTS. WE EVALUATE RECEIVABLES FROM U.S. CUSTOMERS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON BALANCES IN EXCESS OF 90 DAYS AND FOR RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE U.S. WITH AN EMPHASIS ON BALANCES IN EXCESS OF 120 DAYS AND ESTABLISH A RESERVE ALLOWANCE ON THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES IF NEEDED. THE REASON FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN THE EVALUATION OF RECEIVABLES BETWEEN FOREIGN AND U.S. CUSTOMERS IS THAT U.S. CUSTOMERS HAVE HISTORICALLY MADE PAYMENTS IN A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME THAN FOREIGN CUSTOMERS. FOREIGN BUSINESS PRACTICES GENERALLY REQUIRE US TO ALLOW CUSTOMER PAYMENT TERMS THAT ARE LONGER THAN THOSE ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. WE ASSESS THE PROBABILITY OF COLLECTION BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME A RECEIVABLE BALANCE HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING, OUR PAST HISTORY WITH THE CUSTOMER AND THEIR CREDIT-WORTHINESS.  WE EXERCISE JUDGMENT WHEN DETERMINING THE ADEQUACY OF OUR RESERVES AS WE EVALUATE HISTORICAL BAD DEBT TRENDS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY, AND CHANGES IN CUSTOMER FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES ARE RECORDED AS BAD DEBT EXPENSE WHEN ALL EFFORTS TO COLLECT HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED AND RECOVERIES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THEY ARE RECEIVED. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET BALANCE WAS $19.6 MILLION AND $19.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS OF $34,000 AND $358,000, RESPECTIVELY. IF ACTUAL UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WOULD BE REQUIRED, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FUTURE PERIODS.  HISTORICALLY, OUR ALLOWANCE FOR SALES RETURNS RESERVE WAS DEDUCTED FROM GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. UPON ADOPTION, ON JANUARY 1, 2018, OF THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE, ASC TOPIC 606, WE RECLASSIFIED OUR SALES RETURNS  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESERVE TO ACCRUED LIABILITIES. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE BALANCE WAS $60,000 AND $47,000, RESPECTIVELY.  WARRANTY RESERVE  WE MAINTAIN A PRODUCT WARRANTY BASED UPON OUR CLAIMS EXPERIENCE DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS AND ANY PENDING CLAIMS AND RETURNS OF WHICH WE ARE AWARE. WARRANTY COSTS ARE ACCRUED AT THE TIME REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, ACCRUED PRODUCT WARRANTIES TOTALED $325,000 AND $236,000, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN ACCRUED PRODUCT WARRANTIES IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED CLAIMS FOR QUALITY ISSUES EXPERIENCED BY CUSTOMERS. IF ACTUAL WARRANTY COSTS OR PENDING NEW CLAIMS DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITY WOULD BE REQUIRED, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FUTURE PERIODS.  INVENTORY VALUATION  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (APPROXIMATED BY STANDARD COST) OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. COST IS DETERMINED USING THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST METHOD. OUR INVENTORY CONSISTS OF RAW MATERIALS AS WELL AS FINISHED GOODS AND WORK IN PROCESS THAT INCLUDE MATERIAL, LABOR AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD COSTS. WE ROUTINELY EVALUATE THE LEVELS OF OUR INVENTORY IN LIGHT OF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY, AND WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN INVENTORIES BASED UPON THE AGE AND QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT AND THE PROJECTIONS FOR SALE OF THE COMPLETED PRODUCTS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAD AN INVENTORY RESERVE OF $15.6 MILLION AND $14.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY AND $123,000 AND $18,000, RESPECTIVELY, FOR LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE RESERVES. IF ACTUAL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS WERE TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN ESTIMATED, ADDITIONAL INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS FOR EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY MIGHT BE REQUIRED, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS  WE CLASSIFY MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC TOPIC 320, INVESTMENTS - DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. ALL AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES WITH A QUOTED MARKET VALUE BELOW COST (OR ADJUSTED COST) ARE REVIEWED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DECLINE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS IS TEMPORARY INCLUDE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE, THE LENGTH OF TIME THE MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW COST (OR ADJUSTED COST), CREDIT QUALITY, AND OUR ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITIES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE.  WE ALSO INVEST IN EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF PRIVATELY-HELD COMPANIES IN CHINA FOR BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC PURPOSES. INVESTMENTS IN OUR UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE COMPANIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS OTHER ASSETS AND ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER EITHER THE EQUITY OR COST METHOD, DEPENDING ON WHETHER WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THEIR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL DECISIONS. WE MONITOR OUR INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT AND RECORD REDUCTIONS IN CARRYING VALUE WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINATION OF IMPAIRMENT IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING AN ASSESSMENT OF THE STRENGTH OF EACH COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT, THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN OUR COST BASIS, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANY, FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO THE BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANY, SHARE PRICES OF SUBSEQUENT OFFERINGS, AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN OUR CARRYING VALUE.  WE HAVE 25% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN A GERMANIUM MATERIALS COMPANY IN CHINA AND WE INCURRED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR THE PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  AFTER RECEIVING SUCH COMPANY\u2019S PRELIMINARY FIRST QUARTER 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS IN EARLY APRIL 2019 AND ITS PROJECTIONS FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES GOING FORWARD, WE DETERMINED THAT THIS ASSET WAS FULLY IMPAIRED AND WROTE THE ASSET BALANCE DOWN TO ZERO.  THIS RESULTED IN A $1.1 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN OUR FIRST QUARTER 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS. THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS  ASC 820, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES ESTABLISHES THREE LEVELS OF INPUTS THAT MAY BE USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE.  LEVEL 1 INSTRUMENTS REPRESENT QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. THEREFORE, DETERMINING FAIR VALUE FOR LEVEL 1 INSTRUMENTS DOES NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, AND THE ESTIMATION IS NOT DIFFICULT.  LEVEL 2 INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE OBSERVABLE INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 PRICES, SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS IN MARKETS WITH INSUFFICIENT VOLUME OR INFREQUENT TRANSACTIONS (LESS ACTIVE MARKETS), ISSUER BANK STATEMENTS, CREDIT RATINGS, NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT CAN BE CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS IN WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, OR QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. THESE LEVEL 2 INSTRUMENTS REQUIRE MORE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND SUBJECTIVITY COMPARED TO LEVEL 1 INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING.  \u00b7  DETERMINING WHICH INSTRUMENTS ARE MOST SIMILAR TO THE INSTRUMENT BEING PRICED REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO IDENTIFY A SAMPLE OF SIMILAR SECURITIES BASED ON THE COUPON RATES, MATURITY, ISSUER, CREDIT RATING, AND INSTRUMENT TYPE, AND SUBJECTIVELY SELECT AN INDIVIDUAL SECURITY OR MULTIPLE SECURITIES THAT ARE DEEMED MOST SIMILAR TO THE SECURITY BEING PRICED.  \u00b7  DETERMINING WHICH MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS TO USE IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES OR SIMILAR SECURITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, WE PRICE OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS USING NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT ARE CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA OR PRICING MODELS, SUCH AS DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS, WITH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.  LEVEL 3 INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR LEVEL 3 INSTRUMENTS REQUIRES THE MOST MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND SUBJECTIVITY.  WE PLACE SHORT-TERM FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES THAT ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET THE POTENTIAL CASH EXPOSURE RELATED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR AND JAPANESE YEN. WE MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES AT EACH MONTH END AND QUARTER END USING CURRENT EXCHANGE RATES AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. AT QUARTER END ANY FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES NOT SETTLED ARE NETTED IN \u201cACCRUED LIABILITIES\u201d ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3 ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 THE NET CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE FROM THE PLACEMENT OF THE HEDGE TO SETTLEMENT AT EACH MONTH END DURING THE QUARTER HAD A DE MINIMIS IMPACT TO THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO TRANSFERS BETWEEN FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT LEVELS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC TOPIC 360,  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  WHEN EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT LONG-LIVED ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED, WE COMPARE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO THE PROJECTION OF FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THESE ASSETS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, WE RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE AGAINST INCOME EQUAL TO THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE ASSETS\u2019 FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET VALUES, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL APPRAISALS, AS APPLICABLE. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING VALUE OR ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE.  WE HAD NO ASSETS HELD FOR SALE ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  WE ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 718.  SHARE-BASED AWARDS GRANTED INCLUDE STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS. WE UTILIZE THE BLACK\u2010SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS, WHICH REQUIRES THE INPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING ESTIMATING STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED TERM. HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK PRICE WAS USED WHILE THE EXPECTED TERM FOR OUR OPTIONS WAS ESTIMATED BASED ON HISTORICAL OPTION EXERCISE BEHAVIOR AND POST-VESTING FORFEITURES OF OPTIONS, AND THE CONTRACTUAL TERM, THE VESTING PERIOD AND THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE OUTSTANDING OPTIONS. FURTHER, WE APPLY AN EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. WE USE HISTORICAL FORFEITURES TO ESTIMATE THE RATE OF FUTURE FORFEITURES. CHANGES IN THESE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS CAN MATERIALLY AFFECT THE MEASURE OF ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR STOCK COMPENSATION. THE COST OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS IS DETERMINED USING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT.  WE RECOGNIZE THE COMPENSATION COSTS NET OF AN ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE OPTIONS AWARD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE VESTING TERM OF FOUR YEARS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY ONE, THREE OR FOUR YEARS. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECORDED IN COST OF REVENUE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  INCOME TAXES  WE ACCOUNT FOR INCOME TAXES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC TOPIC 740,  INCOME TAXES  (\u201cASC 740\u201d), WHICH REQUIRES THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BE RECOGNIZED USING ENACTED TAX RATES FOR THE EFFECT OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE BOOK AND TAX BASES OF RECORDED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ASC 740 ALSO REQUIRES THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BE REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A PORTION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED. OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO ZERO BY VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  WE PROVIDE FOR INCOME TAXES BASED UPON THE GEOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF WORLDWIDE EARNINGS AND TAX REGULATIONS GOVERNING EACH REGION, PARTICULARLY CHINA. THE CALCULATION OF TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX LAWS, PARTICULARLY IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHINA.  SEE NOTE 14\u2014\u201cINCOME TAXES\u201d IN THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REVENUE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  INCREASE  2019  2018  (DECREASE)% CHANGE  PRODUCT TYPE.

THE SUBSTRATE REVENUE DECREASE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER DEMAND RESULTING FROM A GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOW-DOWN, INCLUDING THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY. TRADE TENSIONS AND POLITICAL TENSIONS CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLOW-DOW  N  .  SEMI-INSULATING AND SEMI-CONDUCTING GAAS REVENUE DECREASED AS DID GE REVENUE. RAW M  ATERIALS SALES DECREASED $1.6 MILLION, OR 31.9%, TO $3.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE RAW MATERIALS REVENUE DECREASE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A REDUCTION IN SHIPMENTS AT OUR DECONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY RAW GALLIUM COMPANY AND OUR REFINED GALLIUM COMPANY.

REVENUE FROM CUSTOMERS IN NORTH AMERICA INCREASED BY 48.4% IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INP SHIPMENTS AND THE RELOCATION BY A CUSTOMER IN JAPAN OF ITS MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION FROM JAPAN TO THE UNITED STATES FOR A CERTAIN DIVISION. REVENUE FROM CUSTOMERS IN EUROPE DECREASED BY 31.6% PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN DEMAND OF GAAS WAFER SUBSTRATES USED BY AN  LED CUSTOMER. REVENUE FROM JAPAN, TAIWAN AND THE OTHER ASIAN PACIFIC COUNTRIES, IN AGGREGATE, DECREASED BY $3.0 MILLION IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 DUE TO A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR SEMICONDUCTING GAAS USED IN WIRELESS DEVICE APPLICATION, AND THE RELOCATION BY A CUSTOMER IN JAPAN OF ITS MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION FROM JAPAN TO THE UNITED STATES FOR A CERTAIN DIVISION.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GROSS MARGIN  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  INCREASE  2019  2018  (DECREASE)% CHANGE  ($ IN THOUSANDS)  GROSS PROFIT  $6,695  $9,573  $(2,878)  (30.1)%  GROSS MARGIN %  33.1%  39.2%  GROSS PROFIT DECREASED $2.9 MILLION, OR 30.1%, TO $6.7 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 FROM $9.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE LOWER SALES VOLUME DURING THE PERIOD OF MARCH 31, 2019 WHEN COMPARED TO THE PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND TO HIGHER MANUFACTURING COSTS, PARTICULARLY IN GAAS.

THE HIGHER SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  PRIMARILY FROM INCREASED EXPENSE AT OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY, NEW HIRES AT OUR NEW LOCATIONS, CONSULTANT EXPENSES AND HIGHER TRAVEL EXPENSES RELATED TO TRAVELING TO OUR NEW MANUFACTURING SITES AND CUSTOMER VISITS.

THE DECREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A RE-ALLOCATION OF PERSONNEL AT ONE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EXPENSE IN NEW PRODUCT TESTING AT AXT.

NO INCOME TAXES OR BENEFITS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR OUR U.S. OPERATIONS AS THE INCOME IN THE U.S. HAD BEEN FULLY OFFSET BY UTILIZATION OF FEDERAL AND STATE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS UNCERTAINTY OF GENERATING FUTURE PROFIT IN THE U.S., WHICH HAS RESULTED IN OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BEING FULLY RESERVED. OUR ESTIMATED TAX RATE CAN VARY GREATLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE OR BENEFIT IN THE MIX OF TAXABLE INCOME BETWEEN OUR U.S. AND CHINA-BASED OPERATIONS.  DUE TO OUR UNCERTAINTY REGARDING OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY IN THE U.S., WE RECORDED A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $20 MILLION IN 2018, $22 MILLION IN 2017 AND $68 MILLION IN 2016.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO  MARCH 31,  NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  2019  2018  DECREASE% CHANGE  ($ IN THOUSANDS)  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  $81  $315  $(234)  (74.3)%% OF TOTAL REVENUE  0.4%  1.3%  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS DECREASED $234,000 OR 74.3% TO $81,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 FROM $315,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PROFITABILITY FROM OUR CHINA JOINT VENTURE OPERATIONS AS SALES DECREASED DUE TO A REDUCTION IN RAW MATERIAL SALES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE CONSIDER CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS AS LIQUID AND AVAILABLE FOR USE WITHIN TWO YEARS IN OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS. SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE COMPRISED OF U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND INVESTMENT-GRADE CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS.

THE BEIJING CITY GOVERNMENT IS MOVING ITS OFFICES INTO THE AREA WHERE OUR ORIGINAL MANUFACTURING FACILITY IS CURRENTLY LOCATED AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING THOUSANDS OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES INTO THIS AREA. TO CREATE ROOM AND UPGRADE THE DISTRICT, THE CITY INSTRUCTED VIRTUALLY ALL EXISTING MANUFACTURING COMPANIES, INCLUDING AXT, TO RELOCATE ALL OR SOME OF THEIR MANUFACTURING LINES. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE RELOCATION OF OUR GALLIUM ARSENIDE AND GERMANIUM PRODUCTION LINES.  ONE NEW SITE, THE CITY OF KAZUO, LOCATED IN THE PROVINCE IN LIAONING NEAR THE INNER MONGOLIA AUTONOMOUS REGION, WILL INITIALLY BE USED FOR POLY SYNTHESIS AND INGOT GROWTH FOR GALLIUM ARSENIDE AND GERMANIUM AS WELL AS POSSIBLE EXPANSION OF INDIUM PHOSPHIDE INGOT GROWTH. A SECOND SITE, THE CITY OF DINGXING, LOCATED IN THE PROVINCE OF HEBEI AND UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE PREFECTURE-LEVEL CITY OF BAODING, WILL BE USED FOR WAFER PROCESSING.  WE EXPECT TO INVEST APPROXIMATELY $21 MILLION RELATED TO THE NEW FACILITIES IN 2019.  WE INTEND TO COMPLETE THE RELOCATION PROCESS FOR GAAS AND GE IN 2019.  ONE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE COMPANIES, JINMEI, IS IN THE PROCESS OF RELOCATING ITS HEADQUARTERS AND MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS TO THE CITY OF KAZUO, NEAR OUR OWN LOCATION. CURRENTLY, JINMEI EXPECTS TO INVEST APPROXIMATELY $2.5 TO $3.5 MILLION RELATED TO THE NEW FACILITIES IN 2019. IN JULY 2017, OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, TONGMEI, PROVIDED AN INTER-COMPANY LOAN TO JINMEI IN THE AMOUNT OF $768,000 IN PREPARATION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THE LAND USE RIGHTS AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW BUILDING. THE INTER-COMPANY LOAN CARRIES AN INTEREST RATE OF 4.9% PER ANNUM AND IS DUE ON JUNE 30, 2023. DURING 2019 AND 2018, JINMEI REPAID TO TONGMEI PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST TOTALING $41,000 AND $453,000, RESPECTIVELY.

ON NOVEMBER 6, 2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH ESTABLISHED A $10 MILLION SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT WITH A $1.0 MILLION LETTER OF CREDIT SUBLIMIT FACILITY. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS COLLATERALIZED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY LOCATED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. THE COMMITMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT EXPIRE ON NOVEMBER 30, 2020 AND ANY LOANS THEREUNDER WILL  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE BASED ON THE DAILY ONE-MONTH LIBOR FOR THE APPLICABLE INTEREST PERIOD PLUS A MARGIN OF 2.00%.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, NO LOANS OR LETTERS OF CREDIT WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE CASH AND INVESTMENTS TO MEET OUR OPERATING NEEDS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. IF OUR SALES DECREASE, HOWEVER, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE LIQUIDITY, REQUIRE US TO USE CASH AT A MORE RAPID RATE THAN EXPECTED, AND REQUIRE US TO SEEK ADDITIONAL CAPITAL.  ON OCTOBER 24, 2016, WE FILED WITH THE SEC A REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE MAY OFFER UP TO $60 MILLION OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK, DEPOSITARY SHARES, WARRANTS, DEBT SECURITIES AND/OR UNITS IN ONE OR MORE OFFERINGS AND IN ANY COMBINATION. ON NOVEMBER 4, 2016, THE SEC DECLARED THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT EFFECTIVE. A PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT, WHICH WE WILL PROVIDE EACH TIME WE OFFER SECURITIES, WILL DESCRIBE THE SPECIFIC AMOUNTS, PRICES AND TERMS OF THE SECURITIES WE DETERMINE TO OFFER.  ON MARCH 2, 2017, WE FILED WITH THE SEC A FINAL PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE OFFERED AND SOLD 5,307,692 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  THE NET PROCEEDS ARE BEING USED FOR THE RELOCATION OF OUR GALLIUM ARSENIDE PRODUCTION LINE, FOR EQUIPMENT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL FOR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY, POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS OF COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESSES AND OTHER GENERAL PURPOSES.  CASH FROM OPERATIONS COULD BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE SET FORTH BELOW UNDER ITEM 1A \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  PURCHASE ORDERS OR CONTRACTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF CERTAIN GOODS AND SERVICES ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE PART OF OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. WE CANNOT DETERMINE THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SUCH PURCHASE ORDERS THAT REPRESENT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS BECAUSE PURCHASE ORDERS MAY REPRESENT AUTHORIZATIONS TO PURCHASE RATHER THAN BINDING AGREEMENTS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS DISCLOSURE, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR PURCHASE OF GOODS OR SERVICES ARE DEFINED AS AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING AND THAT SPECIFY ALL SIGNIFICANT TERMS, INCLUDING FIXED OR MINIMUM QUANTITIES TO BE PURCHASED; FIXED, MINIMUM, OR VARIABLE PRICE PROVISIONS; AND THE APPROXIMATE TIMING OF THE TRANSACTION. OUR PURCHASE ORDERS ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT NEEDS AND ARE FULFILLED BY OUR VENDORS WITHIN SHORT TIME HORIZONS. WE ALSO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS FOR OUTSOURCED SERVICES; HOWEVER, THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE CONTRACTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT AND THE CONTRACTS GENERALLY CONTAIN CLAUSES ALLOWING FOR CANCELLATION WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT PENALTY. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE CONTINGENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES WOULD ALSO NOT BE INCLUDED.  LAND PURCHASE AND INVESTMENT AGREEMENT  WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF RELOCATING OUR GALLIUM ARSENIDE PRODUCTION LINE TO DINGXING, CHINA.  IN ADDITION TO A LAND RIGHTS AND BUILDING PURCHASE AGREEMENT THAT WE ENTERED INTO WITH A PRIVATE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT COMPANY TO ACQUIRE OUR NEW MANUFACTURING FACILITY, WE ALSO ENTERED INTO A COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH THE DINGXING LOCAL GOVERNMENT.  IN ADDITION TO PLEDGING ITS FULL SUPPORT AND COOPERATION, THE DINGXING LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL ISSUE CERTAIN CREDITS OR REBATES TO US AS WE ACHIEVE CERTAIN MILESTONES.  WE, IN TURN, AGREED TO HIRE LOCAL WORKERS OVER TIME, PAY TAXES WHEN DUE AND EVENTUALLY DEMONSTRATE A TOTAL INVESTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION IN VALUE, ASSETS AND CAPITAL.  THE INVESTMENT WILL INCLUDE CASH PAID FOR THE LAND AND BUILDINGS, CASH ON DEPOSIT IN OUR NAME AT LOCAL BANKS, THE GROSS VALUE OF NEW AND USED EQUIPMENT (INCLUDING FUTURE EQUIPMENT THAT MIGHT BE USED FOR INDIUM PHOSPHIDE AND GERMANIUM SUBSTRATES PRODUCTION), THE DEEMED VALUE FOR OUR CUSTOMER LIST OR THE END USER OF OUR SUBSTRATES (FOR EXAMPLE, THE END USERS OF 3-D SENSING VCSELS), A DEEMED VALUE FOR EMPLOYMENT OF LOCAL CITIZENS, A DEEMED VALUE FOR OUR PROPRIETARY PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OTHER INTANGIBLES AND ADDITIONAL ITEMS OF VALUE.  THERE IS NO TIMELINE OR DEADLINE BY WHICH THIS MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED, RATHER IT IS A GOOD FAITH COVENANT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN AXT AND THE DINGXING LOCAL GOVERNMENT.  FURTHER, THERE IS NO SPECIFIC PENALTY CONTEMPLATED IF EITHER PARTY BREACHES THE AGREEMENT. HOWEVER THE AGREEMENT DOES STATE THAT EACH PARTY HAS A RIGHT TO SEEK FROM THE OTHER PARTY COMPENSATION FOR LOSSES.  UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, THE DINGXING LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAY PURCHASE THE LAND AND BUILDING AT THE APPRAISED VALUE. WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH COOPERATION AGREEMENTS ARE NORMAL, CUSTOMARY AND USUAL IN CHINA AND THAT THE FUTURE VALUATION IS FLEXIBLE. WE HAVE A SIMILAR AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF KAZUO, CHINA, ALTHOUGH ON A SMALLER SCALE. THE TOTAL  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVESTMENT TARGETED BY AXT IN KAZUO IS APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION IN VALUE, ASSETS AND CAPITAL. IN ADDITION, BOYU HAS A SIMILAR AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF KAZUO. THE TOTAL INVESTMENT TARGETED BY BOYU IN KAZUO IS APPROXIMATELY $8 MILLION IN VALUE, ASSETS AND CAPITAL.

IF A LOAN IS INDIVIDUALLY EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT, THE COLLATERAL VALUE OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS IS GENERALLY USED TO DETERMINE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, NET OF ESTIMATED SELLING COSTS, AND COMPARED TO THE OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCE TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF RESERVE NECESSARY, IF ANY. APPRAISALS USED IN THIS EVALUATION PROCESS ARE TYPICALLY LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGED. FOR LOANS WHERE REAL ESTATE IS NOT THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF COLLATERAL, UPDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS OBTAINED, INCLUDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY AGING REPORTS AND RELEVANT SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LOAN, NET OF ESTIMATED SELLING COSTS, AND COMPARED TO THE OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCE TO ESTIMATE THE REQUIRED RESERVE.  56  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THESE IMPAIRMENT MEASUREMENTS ARE INHERENTLY SUBJECTIVE AS THEY REQUIRE MATERIAL ESTIMATES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, ESTIMATES OF PROPERTY VALUES IN APPRAISALS, THE AMOUNTS AND TIMING OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON INDIVIDUAL LOANS, AND GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, UNCERTAINTIES IN ESTIMATING LOSSES AND INHERENT RISKS IN THE VARIOUS CREDIT PORTFOLIOS, ALL OF WHICH REQUIRE JUDGMENT AND MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE OVER TIME AND AS A RESULT OF CHANGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR OTHER FACTORS.

DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. COMPLETED ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF COMMON STOCK, OR OUR IPO, ON NOVEMBER 3, 2004. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE OPERATED IN A MANNER THAT HAS ENABLED US TO QUALIFY, AND HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED, AS A REIT UNDER SECTIONS 856 THROUGH 860 OF THE CODE. OUR COMPANY WAS FORMED ON MARCH 9, 2004. DURING THE PERIOD FROM OUR FORMATION UNTIL WE COMMENCED OPERATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPLETION OF OUR IPO, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY CORPORATE ACTIVITY OTHER THAN THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH THE INITIAL CAPITALIZATION OF THE COMPANY. OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP WAS FORMED ON JULY 21, 2004.  BUSINESS AND STRATEGY  . OUR PRIMARY BUSINESS OBJECTIVES ARE TO MAXIMIZE: (I) SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM GROWTH IN EARNINGS AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS PER SHARE AND UNIT, (II) CASH FLOW AND RETURNS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S UNITHOLDERS THROUGH THE PAYMENT OF DISTRIBUTIONS AND (III) RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. WE EXPECT TO ACCOMPLISH OUR OBJECTIVES BY ACHIEVING SUPERIOR RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS, PRUDENTLY ALLOCATING CAPITAL, DIVERSIFYING OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, ACCELERATING OUR GLOBAL REACH AND SCALE AND DRIVING REVENUE GROWTH AND OPERATING EFFICIENCIES. WE PLAN TO FOCUS ON OUR CORE BUSINESS OF INVESTING IN AND DEVELOPING AND OPERATING DATA CENTERS. A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE INTERNAL GROWTH IS ANTICIPATED THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR EXISTING SPACE HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT, ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION OF NEW PROPERTIES. WE TARGET HIGH-QUALITY, STRATEGICALLY LOCATED PROPERTIES CONTAINING THE PHYSICAL AND CONNECTIVITY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SUPPORTS THE APPLICATIONS AND OPERATIONS OF DATA CENTER AND TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY CUSTOMERS AND PROPERTIES THAT MAY BE DEVELOPED FOR SUCH USE. MOST OF OUR DATA CENTER PROPERTIES CONTAIN FULLY REDUNDANT ELECTRICAL SUPPLY SYSTEMS, MULTIPLE POWER FEEDS, ABOVE-STANDARD COOLING SYSTEMS, RAISED FLOOR AREAS, EXTENSIVE IN-BUILDING COMMUNICATIONS CABLING AND HIGH-LEVEL SECURITY SYSTEMS. WE FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON OWNING, ACQUIRING, DEVELOPING AND OPERATING DATA CENTERS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THE GROWTH IN DATA CENTER DEMAND AND THE TECHNOLOGY-RELATED REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY GENERALLY WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE THE OVERALL ECONOMY.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR PORTFOLIO INCLUDED  215  DATA CENTERS, INCLUDING  35  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES, WITH APPROXIMATELY  34.9 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY  3.2 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROXIMATELY  2.1 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT. THE  35  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES HAVE AN AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY  3.7 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET. THE  27  PARCELS OF DEVELOPABLE LAND WE OWN AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY  964  ACRES. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY  2.7 MILLION  SQUARE FEET WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION FOR TURN-KEY FLEX  \u00ae  AND POWERED BASE BUILDING  \u00ae  PRODUCTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE INCOME PRODUCING ON OR AFTER COMPLETION, IN  FOUR  U.S. METROPOLITAN AREAS,  FOUR  EUROPEAN METROPOLITAN AREAS,  TWO  ASIAN METROPOLITAN AREAS,  ONE  AUSTRALIAN METROPOLITAN AREAS AND  ONE  CANADIAN METROPOLITAN AREA, CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY  1.8 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF BASE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND  0.9 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF DATA CENTER CONSTRUCTION.  WE HAVE DEVELOPED DETAILED, STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATING NEW REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY MEET OUR FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL AND OTHER CRITERIA. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL ASSETS AS PART OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY. WE INTEND TO AGGRESSIVELY MANAGE AND LEASE OUR ASSETS TO INCREASE THEIR CASH FLOW. WE MAY CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT OUR DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO WHEN JUSTIFIED BY ANTICIPATED DEMAND AND RETURNS.  WE MAY ACQUIRE PROPERTIES SUBJECT TO EXISTING MORTGAGE FINANCING AND OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OR WE MAY INCUR NEW INDEBTEDNESS IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUIRING OR REFINANCING THESE PROPERTIES. DEBT SERVICE ON SUCH INDEBTEDNESS WILL HAVE A PRIORITY OVER ANY CASH DIVIDENDS WITH RESPECT TO DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.\u2019S COMMON STOCK AND PREFERRED STOCK. WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A CONSERVATIVE CAPITAL STRUCTURE. WE TARGET A DEBT-TO-ADJUSTED EBITDA RATIO AT OR LESS THAN 5.5X, FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE OF GREATER THAN THREE TIMES, AND FLOATING RATE DEBT AT LESS THAN 20% OF TOTAL OUTSTANDING DEBT. IN ADDITION, WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A WELL-LADDERED DEBT MATURITY SCHEDULE, AND WE SEEK TO MAXIMIZE THE MENU OF OUR AVAILABLE SOURCES OF CAPITAL, WHILE MINIMIZING THE COST.  REVENUE BASE  . AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE OPERATED  215  DATA CENTERS THROUGH OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, INCLUDING  35  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES.

DUE TO THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE AND LONG-TERM NATURE OF THE OPERATIONS BEING SUPPORTED, OUR LEASE TERMS ARE GENERALLY LONGER THAN STANDARD COMMERCIAL LEASES. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR AVERAGE REMAINING LEASE TERM IS APPROXIMATELY  FIVE  YEARS. OUR SCHEDULED LEASE EXPIRATIONS THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2020 ARE  18.1%  OF RENTABLE SQUARE FEET EXCLUDING MONTH-TO-MONTH LEASES, SPACE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND SPACE HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019.  FACTORS WHICH MAY INFLUENCE FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GLOBAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN SOME OR ALL OF THE METROPOLITAN AREAS IN WHICH WE OWN PROPERTIES AND CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS. IN JUNE 2016, A MAJORITY OF VOTERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ELECTED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION IN A NATIONAL REFERENDUM. THE TERMS OF ANY WITHDRAWAL ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS. NEVERTHELESS, THE REFERENDUM HAS CREATED SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FUTURE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND HAS GIVEN RISE TO CALLS FOR THE GOVERNMENTS OF OTHER EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES TO CONSIDER WITHDRAWAL. INSTABILITY IN THE U.S., EUROPEAN, ASIA PACIFIC AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY, AND THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, TO REPLACE OR RENEW MATURING LIABILITIES ON A TIMELY BASIS, ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS TO MEET LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS AND MAY RESULT IN ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR, AND OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN ADDITION, OUR ACCESS TO FUNDS UNDER OUR GLOBAL REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DEPENDS ON THE ABILITY OF THE LENDERS THAT ARE PARTIES TO SUCH FACILITIES TO MEET THEIR FUNDING COMMITMENTS TO US. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT LONG-TERM DISRUPTIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND THE RETURN OF TIGHTER CREDIT CONDITIONS AMONG, AND POTENTIAL FAILURES OR NATIONALIZATIONS OF, THIRD PARTY FINANCIAL  65  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INSTITUTIONS AS A RESULT OF SUCH DISRUPTIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LENDERS. IF OUR LENDERS ARE NOT ABLE TO MEET THEIR FUNDING COMMITMENTS TO US, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  IF WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW TO CONTINUE OPERATING OUR BUSINESS AND ARE UNABLE TO BORROW ADDITIONAL FUNDS, ACCESS OUR EXISTING LINES OF CREDIT OR RAISE EQUITY OR DEBT CAPITAL, WE MAY NEED TO SOURCE ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO INCREASE OUR LIQUIDITY. SUCH ALTERNATIVES MAY INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CURTAILING DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY, DISPOSING OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR PROPERTIES POSSIBLY ON DISADVANTAGEOUS TERMS OR ENTERING INTO OR RENEWING LEASES ON LESS FAVORABLE TERMS THAN WE OTHERWISE WOULD.  FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK.  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND 2018, WE HAD FOREIGN OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, IRELAND, FRANCE, THE NETHERLANDS, GERMANY, SWITZERLAND, CANADA, SINGAPORE, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN AND HONG KONG AS WELL AS BRAZIL FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , AND, AS SUCH, ARE SUBJECT TO RISK FROM THE EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH MAY AFFECT FUTURE COSTS AND CASH FLOWS. OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED IN THE BRITISH POUND STERLING, EURO, CANADIAN DOLLAR, SINGAPORE DOLLAR, AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR, BRAZILIAN REAL, JAPANESE YEN AND THE HONG KONG DOLLAR. AS A RESULT OF THE ASCENTY JOINT VENTURE AND DECONSOLIDATION OF ASCENTY, OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK RELATED TO THE BRAZILIAN REAL IS LIMITED TO THE IMPACT THAT CURRENCY HAS ON OUR SHARE OF THE ASCENTY JOINT VENTURE'S OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. OUR PRIMARY CURRENCY EXPOSURES ARE TO THE BRITISH POUND STERLING, THE EURO AND THE SINGAPORE DOLLAR. THE POSSIBLE EXIT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM (OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY) FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, OR PROLONGED PERIODS OF UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO ANY OF THESE POSSIBILITIES, COULD RESULT IN INCREASED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE VOLATILITY. WE ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE A PORTION OF THE RISK OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATION BY FINANCING OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE LOCAL CURRENCY DENOMINATIONS, ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL BE EFFECTIVE. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN THE RELATION OF ANY SUCH FOREIGN CURRENCY TO U.S. DOLLARS MAY AFFECT OUR REVENUES, OPERATING MARGINS AND DISTRIBUTIONS AND MAY ALSO AFFECT THE BOOK VALUE OF OUR ASSETS, THE BOOK VALUE OF OUR DEBT AND THE AMOUNT OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY.  RENTAL INCOME  . THE AMOUNT OF RENTAL INCOME GENERATED BY THE DATA CENTERS IN OUR PORTFOLIO DEPENDS ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR IMPROVE THE OCCUPANCY RATES OF CURRENTLY LEASED SPACE AND TO LEASE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SPACE AND SPACE AVAILABLE FROM LEASE TERMINATIONS. EXCLUDING APPROXIMATELY  3.2 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROXIMATELY  2.1 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE OCCUPANCY RATE OF OUR PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THE  35  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES, WAS APPROXIMATELY  88.6%  OF OUR NET RENTABLE SQUARE FEET.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD MORE THAN  2,000  CUSTOMERS IN OUR DATA CENTER PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THE  13  DATA CENTERS HELD IN OUR MANAGED PORTFOLIO OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY  91%  OF OUR LEASES (ON A RENTABLE SQUARE FOOTAGE BASIS) CONTAINED BASE RENT ESCALATIONS THAT WERE EITHER FIXED (GENERALLY RANGING FROM  2%  TO  4%  ) OR INDEXED BASED ON A CONSUMER PRICE INDEX OR OTHER SIMILAR INFLATION-RELATED INDEX. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THESE ESCALATIONS WILL COVER ANY INCREASES IN OUR COSTS OR WILL OTHERWISE KEEP RENTAL RATES AT OR ABOVE MARKET RATES.  THE AMOUNT OF RENTAL INCOME GENERATED BY US ALSO DEPENDS ON MAINTAINING OR INCREASING RENTAL RATES AT OUR PROPERTIES, WHICH IN TURN DEPENDS ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND MARKET RATES FOR DATA CENTER SPACE. INCLUDED IN OUR APPROXIMATELY  26.6 MILLION  NET RENTABLE SQUARE FEET, EXCLUDING SPACE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND SPACE HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT AND  35  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES, AT  MARCH 31, 2019  IS APPROXIMATELY  0.9 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF DATA CENTER SPACE WITH EXTENSIVE INSTALLED TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AVAILABLE FOR LEASE. OUR TURN-KEY FLEX  \u00ae  PRODUCT IS AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION FOR CUSTOMERS WHO PREFER TO UTILIZE A PARTNER WITH THE EXPERTISE OR CAPITAL BUDGET TO PROVIDE EXTENSIVE DATA CENTER INFRASTRUCTURE AND SECURITY. OUR EXPERTISE IN DATA CENTER CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONS ENABLES US TO LEASE SPACE TO THESE CUSTOMERS AT A PREMIUM OVER OTHER USES. IN ADDITION, AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  3.2 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROXIMATELY  2.1 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT, OR APPROXIMATELY  15%  OF THE TOTAL RENTABLE SPACE IN OUR PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THE  35  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES. OUR ABILITY TO GROW EARNINGS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP SPACE AND LEASE DEVELOPMENT SPACE AT FAVORABLE RATES, WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN. DEVELOPMENT SPACE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO DEVELOP DATA CENTER FACILITIES THAT ARE READY FOR USE AND, IN ADDITION, WE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TIME OR ENCOUNTER DELAYS IN SECURING TENANTS FOR DEVELOPMENT SPACE. WE MAY PURCHASE ADDITIONAL VACANT PROPERTIES AND PROPERTIES WITH VACANT DEVELOPMENT SPACE IN THE FUTURE. WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO FINANCE OUR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE OR MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER \u201cGLOBAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.\u201d  IN ADDITION, THE TIMING BETWEEN WHEN WE SIGN A NEW LEASE WITH A CUSTOMER AND WHEN THAT LEASE COMMENCES AND WE BEGIN TO GENERATE RENTAL INCOME MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND MAY NOT BE EASILY PREDICTABLE. CERTAIN LEASES MAY PROVIDE FOR STAGGERED COMMENCEMENT DATES FOR ADDITIONAL SPACE, THE TIMING OF WHICH MAY BE DELAYED SIGNIFICANTLY.  66  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER \u201cGLOBAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,\u201d OR REGIONAL DOWNTURNS AFFECTING OUR METROPOLITAN AREAS OR DOWNTURNS IN THE DATA CENTER INDUSTRY THAT IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO LEASE OR RENEW OR RE-LEASE SPACE, OR OTHERWISE REDUCE RETURNS ON OUR INVESTMENTS OR THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO FULFILL THEIR LEASE COMMITMENTS, AS IN THE CASE OF TENANT BANKRUPTCIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE RENTAL RATES AT OUR PROPERTIES.  SCHEDULED LEASE EXPIRATIONS.  OUR ABILITY TO RE-LEASE EXPIRING SPACE AT RENTAL RATES EQUAL TO OR IN EXCESS OF CURRENT RENTAL RATES WILL IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO APPROXIMATELY  3.2 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF AVAILABLE SPACE IN OUR PORTFOLIO, WHICH EXCLUDES APPROXIMATELY  3.2 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROXIMATELY  2.1 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND THE  SEVENTEEN  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN OUR NON-MANAGED UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES, LEASES REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY  8.9%  AND  9.2%  OF THE NET RENTABLE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF OUR PORTFOLIO ARE SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2020, RESPECTIVELY.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE SIGNED RENEWAL LEASES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  2.0 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE AND NEW LEASES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  0.3 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE.

(5)  INCLUDES LEASES SIGNED FOR NEW AND RE-LEASED SPACE.  OUR ABILITY TO RE-LEASE OR RENEW EXPIRING SPACE AT RENTAL RATES EQUAL TO OR IN EXCESS OF CURRENT RENTAL RATES WILL IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE CONTINUE TO SEE STRONG DEMAND IN MOST OF OUR KEY METROPOLITAN AREAS FOR DATA CENTER SPACE AND, SUBJECT TO THE SUPPLY OF AVAILABLE DATA CENTER SPACE IN THESE METROPOLITAN AREAS, EXPECT THE RENTAL RATES WE ARE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE ON RE-LEASED OR RENEWED DATA CENTER SPACE LEASES FOR 2018 EXPIRATIONS ON AN AVERAGE AGGREGATE BASIS WILL GENERALLY BE HIGHER THAN THE RATES CURRENTLY BEING PAID FOR THE SAME SPACE ON A GAAP BASIS AND SLIGHTLY DOWN ON A CASH BASIS. FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , RENTS ON RENEWED SPACE INCREASED BY AN AVERAGE OF  4.3%  ON A GAAP BASIS ON OUR TURN-KEY FLEX  \u00ae  SPACE COMPARED TO THE EXPIRING RENTS AND INCREASED BY AN AVERAGE OF  11.1%  ON A GAAP BASIS ON OUR POWERED BASE BUILDING  \u00ae  SPACE COMPARED TO THE EXPIRING RENTS. OUR PAST PERFORMANCE MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS, AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT LEASES WILL BE RENEWED OR THAT OUR DATA CENTERS WILL BE RE-LEASED AT ALL OR AT RENTAL RATES EQUAL TO OR ABOVE THE CURRENT AVERAGE  67  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RENTAL RATES. FURTHER, RE-LEASED/RENEWED RENTAL RATES IN A PARTICULAR METROPOLITAN AREA MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH RENTAL RATES ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO AS A WHOLE AND MAY FLUCTUATE FROM ONE PERIOD TO ANOTHER DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING LOCAL REAL ESTATE CONDITIONS, LOCAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR DATA CENTER SPACE, COMPETITION FROM OTHER DATA CENTER DEVELOPERS OR OPERATORS, THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY AND WHETHER THE PROPERTY, OR SPACE WITHIN THE PROPERTY, HAS BEEN DEVELOPED.  GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION.  WE DEPEND ON THE MARKET FOR DATA CENTERS IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THESE REGIONAL METROPOLITAN AREAS CAN IMPACT OUR FUTURE RESULTS. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THE  35  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES, WAS GEOGRAPHICALLY CONCENTRATED IN THE FOLLOWING METROPOLITAN AREAS.  METROPOLITAN AREA  PERCENTAGE OF  MARCH 31, 2019 TOTAL ANNUALIZED RENT (1)  NORTHERN VIRGINIA  23.7%  CHICAGO  11.7%  SILICON VALLEY  8.7%  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM  8.7%  NEW YORK  8.2%  DALLAS  7.6%  SINGAPORE  3.5%  PHOENIX  3.5%  SAO PAULO  2.8%  SAN FRANCISCO  2.7%  SEATTLE  2.3%  ATLANTA  2.0%  AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS  1.9%  OTHER  12.7%  TOTAL  100.0%  (1)  ANNUALIZED RENT IS MONTHLY CONTRACTUAL RENT (DEFINED AS CASH BASE RENT BEFORE ABATEMENTS) UNDER EXISTING LEASES AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  MULTIPLIED BY 12. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ABATEMENTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS APPROXIMATELY  $17.9 MILLION.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  OUR OPERATING EXPENSES GENERALLY CONSIST OF UTILITIES, PROPERTY AND AD VALOREM TAXES, PROPERTY MANAGEMENT FEES, INSURANCE AND SITE MAINTENANCE COSTS, AS WELL AS RENTAL EXPENSES ON OUR GROUND AND BUILDING LEASES. IN PARTICULAR, OUR BUILDINGS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT POWER TO SUPPORT THE DATA CENTER OPERATIONS CONTAINED IN THEM. MANY OF OUR LEASES CONTAIN PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE TENANTS REIMBURSE US FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES AND REAL ESTATE TAXES INCURRED BY US. HOWEVER, IN SOME CASES WE ARE NOT ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT OF PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, OTHER THAN UTILITY EXPENSE, AND REAL ESTATE TAXES UNDER OUR LEASES FOR TURN-KEY FLEX\u00ae FACILITIES. WE ALSO INCUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING EXPENSES RELATING TO OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION, OR THE SEC, REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN SUCH OPERATING EXPENSES WILL IMPACT OUR OVERALL PERFORMANCE. WE EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL OPERATING EXPENSES AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND.  CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION.  IN JUNE 2009, THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES APPROVED COMPREHENSIVE CLEAN ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION INTENDED TO CUT GREENHOUSE GAS, OR GHG, EMISSIONS, VIA A CAP-AND-TRADE PROGRAM. THE U.S. SENATE DID NOT SUBSEQUENTLY PASS SIMILAR LEGISLATION. SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION TO FEDERAL CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION EXISTS.  IN THE ABSENCE OF COMPREHENSIVE FEDERAL CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION, OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, REGULATORY AGENCIES, PRIMARILY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, OR EPA, AND STATES TOOK THE LEAD IN REGULATING GHG EMISSIONS IN THE U.S. UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, THE EPA MOVED AGGRESSIVELY TO REGULATE GHG EMISSIONS FROM AUTOMOBILES AND LARGE STATIONARY SOURCES, INCLUDING ELECTRICITY PRODUCERS, USING ITS OWN AUTHORITY UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS MOVED TO ELIMINATE OR MODIFY CERTAIN OF THE EPA\u2019S GHG EMISSIONS REGULATIONS AND REFOCUS THE EPA\u2019S MISSION AWAY FROM SUCH REGULATION.  68  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE EPA MADE AN ENDANGERMENT FINDING IN 2009 THAT ALLOWS IT TO CREATE REGULATIONS IMPOSING EMISSIONS REPORTING, PERMITTING, CONTROL TECHNOLOGY INSTALLATION, AND MONITORING REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN EMITTERS OF GHGS, INCLUDING FACILITIES THAT PROVIDE ELECTRICITY TO OUR DATA CENTERS, ALTHOUGH THE MATERIALITY OF THE IMPACTS WILL NOT BE FULLY KNOWN UNTIL ALL REGULATIONS ARE FINALIZED AND LEGAL CHALLENGES ARE RESOLVED. UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, THE EPA FINALIZED RULES IMPOSING  PERMITTING AND CONTROL TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS UPON CERTAIN NEWLY-CONSTRUCTED OR MODIFIED FACILITIES WHICH EMIT GHGS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT NEW SOURCE REVIEW PREVENTION OF SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION, OR NSR PSD, AND TITLE V PERMITTING PROGRAMS. AS A RESULT, NEWLY-ISSUED NSR PSD AND TITLE V PERMITS FOR NEW OR MODIFIED ELECTRICITY GENERATING UNITS (EGUS) AND OTHER FACILITIES MAY NEED TO ADDRESS GHG EMISSIONS, INCLUDING BY REQUIRING THE INSTALLATION OF \u201cBEST AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY.\u201d THE EPA IMPLEMENTED IN DECEMBER 2015 THE \u201cCLEAN POWER PLAN\u201d REGULATING CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSIONS FROM NEW AND EXISTING COAL-FIRED AND NATURAL GAS EGUS. EXISTING EGUS ARE SUBJECT TO STATEWIDE CO2 EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGETS, AN EFFORT DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE A THIRTY-TWO PERCENT REDUCTION IN NATIONWIDE EXISTING EGU CO2 EMISSIONS BY 2030 (IN COMPARISON TO 2005 LEVELS). THE CLEAN POWER PLAN WOULD SUBJECT NEW, MODIFIED, AND RECONSTRUCTED EGUS TO \u201cNEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS\u201d THAT INCLUDE BOTH TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS AND NUMERIC EMISSION LIMITS. HOWEVER, TWENTY-FOUR STATES AND A NUMBER OF INDUSTRY GROUPS CHALLENGED THE CLEAN POWER PLAN IN FEDERAL COURT, AND IN FEBRUARY 2016 THE U.S. SUPREME COURT ISSUED A STAY OF THE CLEAN POWER PLAN UNTIL THE LEGAL CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN DECIDED. IN MARCH 2017, PRESIDENT TRUMP ORDERED THE EPA TO REVIEW AND IF APPROPRIATE REVISE OR RESCIND THE CLEAN POWER PLAN, AND THE EPA PROPOSED TO REPEAL THE CLEAN POWER PLAN IN OCTOBER 2017. IN AUGUST 2018, THE EPA PROPOSED THE \u201cAFFORDABLE CLEAN ENERGY RULE\u201d TO REPLACE THE CLEAN POWER PLAN. SEPARATELY, THE EPA\u2019S GHG \u201cREPORTING RULE\u201d REQUIRES THAT CERTAIN EMITTERS, INCLUDING ELECTRICITY GENERATORS, MONITOR AND REPORT GHG EMISSIONS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MAY SEEK TO REVISE OR REVERSE THESE REGULATIONS.  AS A RESULT, STATES MAY DRIVE NEAR-TERM REGULATION TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. AT THE STATE LEVEL, CALIFORNIA IMPLEMENTED A GHG CAP-AND-TRADE PROGRAM THAT BEGAN IMPOSING COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS ON INDUSTRIAL SECTORS, INCLUDING ELECTRICITY GENERATORS AND IMPORTERS, IN JANUARY 2013. IN SEPTEMBER 2016, CALIFORNIA ADOPTED LEGISLATION CALLING FOR A FURTHER REDUCTION IN GHG EMISSIONS TO 40% BELOW 1990 LEVELS BY 2030, AND IN JULY 2017, CALIFORNIA EXTENDED ITS CAP-AND-TRADE PROGRAM THROUGH 2030. IN SEPTEMBER 2018, CALIFORNIA ADOPTED LEGISLATION THAT WILL REQUIRE ALL OF THE STATE\u2019S ELECTRICITY TO COME FROM CARBON-FREE SOURCES BY 2045. AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF STATE ACTION, IN JANUARY 2018, NEW JERSEY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD RE-JOIN NINE OTHER EASTERN STATES IN THE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE (RGGI), A MARKET-BASED PROGRAM AIMED AT REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS. SEVERAL OTHER STATES HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY ARE ACTIVELY PURSUING NEW GHG REDUCTION PROGRAMS.  OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION, OR EU (INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM), HAS BEEN OPERATING SINCE 2005 UNDER A CAP-AND-TRADE PROGRAM, WHICH DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE LARGEST EMITTERS OF GHGS, INCLUDING ELECTRICITY PRODUCERS FROM WHOM WE PURCHASE POWER, AND THE EU HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF OTHER CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED INITIATIVES, INCLUDING A DIRECTIVE TARGETED AT IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY (WHICH INTRODUCES ENERGY EFFICIENCY AUDITING REQUIREMENTS).  THE PARIS AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE UNITED STATES AND 194 OTHER COUNTRIES AND LOOKS TO PREVENT GLOBAL AVERAGE TEMPERATURES FROM INCREASING BY MORE THAN 2 DEGREES CELSIUS ABOVE PREINDUSTRIAL LEVELS OFFICIALLY WENT INTO FORCE ON NOVEMBER 4, 2016. PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED IN JUNE 2017 THAT HE WILL INITIATE THE PROCESS TO WITHDRAW THE UNITED STATES FROM THE PARIS AGREEMENT; HOWEVER, A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE FORMED GROUPS SUPPORTING THE PARIS AGREEMENT AND PLEDGING TO FULFILL ITS GOALS AT THE STATE LEVEL. NATIONAL LEGISLATION MAY ALSO BE IMPLEMENTED INDEPENDENTLY BY MEMBERS OF THE EU.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CRC ENERGY EFFICIENCY SCHEME INTRODUCED A MANDATORY REPORTING AND PRICING SCHEME THAT IS DESIGNED TO INCENTIVIZE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CUT EMISSIONS BY LARGE ENERGY USERS. IT IS NOT YET CLEAR HOW BREXIT, IF EFFECTUATED, WILL IMPACT THE UNITED KINGDOM\u2019S (OR THE EU\u2019S) APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION. THE CANADIAN GREENHOUSE GAS POLLUTION PRICING ACT ESTABLISHED A CARBON-PRICING REGIME THAT WENT INTO EFFECT JANUARY 1, 2019 FOR PROVINCES AND TERRITORIES IN CANADA WHERE THERE IS NO PROVINCIAL SYSTEM IN PLACE ALREADY, SUCH AS ONTARIO, OR WHERE THE PROVINCIAL SYSTEM DOES NOT MEET THE FEDERAL BENCHMARK. CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF IMPLEMENTATION IN OTHER NATIONS AS WELL, INCLUDING NATIONS WHERE WE OPERATE, SUCH AS JAPAN, SINGAPORE, AND AUSTRALIA.  THE COST OF ELECTRIC POWER COMPRISES A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES. ANY ADDITIONAL TAXATION OR REGULATION OF ENERGY USE, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF (I) NEW LEGISLATION THAT CONGRESS MAY PASS, (II) THE REGULATIONS THAT THE EPA HAS PROPOSED OR FINALIZED, (III) REGULATIONS UNDER LEGISLATION THAT STATES HAVE PASSED OR MAY PASS, OR (IV) ANY FURTHER LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS IN THE EU OR OTHER REGIONS WHERE WE OPERATE COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR COSTS, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY PASS ALL OF THESE COSTS ON TO OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE MATTERS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  INTEREST RATES  . AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  $0.8 BILLION  OF VARIABLE RATE DEBT SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS, ALONG WITH  $857.2 MILLION  ,  $437.9 MILLION  AND  $140.2 MILLION  OF VARIABLE RATE DEBT THAT WAS OUTSTANDING ON THE GLOBAL REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE UNSWAPPED PORTION OF THE UNSECURED TERM LOANS AND THE FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE 2019, OR THE 2019 NOTES, RESPECTIVELY. THE AVAILABILITY OF DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MAY DECREASE OR BE ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS AS A RESULT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER \u201cGLOBAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS\u201d OR OTHER FACTORS. THE EFFECTS ON COMMERCIAL  69  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REAL ESTATE MORTGAGES, IF AVAILABLE, INCLUDE, BUT MAY NOT BE LIMITED TO: HIGHER LOAN SPREADS, TIGHTENED LOAN COVENANTS, REDUCED LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS RESULTING IN LOWER BORROWER PROCEEDS AND HIGHER PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS. POTENTIAL FUTURE INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES AND CREDIT SPREADS MAY INCREASE OUR INTEREST EXPENSE AND FIXED CHARGES AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, POTENTIALLY IMPACTING OUR FUTURE ACCESS TO THE DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS. INCREASED INTEREST RATES MAY ALSO INCREASE THE RISK THAT THE COUNTERPARTIES TO OUR SWAP AGREEMENTS WILL DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS, WHICH COULD FURTHER INCREASE OUR INTEREST EXPENSE. IF WE CANNOT OBTAIN CAPITAL FROM THIRD PARTY SOURCES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP PROPERTIES WHEN STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES EXIST, SATISFY OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS OR PAY THE CASH DIVIDENDS TO DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.\u2019S STOCKHOLDERS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN ITS QUALIFICATION AS A REIT.  DEMAND FOR DATA CENTER SPACE  . OUR PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF DATA CENTERS. A DECREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR, OR INCREASE IN SUPPLY OF, DATA CENTER SPACE, INTERNET GATEWAY FACILITIES OR OTHER TECHNOLOGY-RELATED REAL ESTATE WOULD HAVE A GREATER ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION THAN IF WE OWNED A PORTFOLIO WITH A MORE DIVERSIFIED CUSTOMER BASE OR LESS SPECIALIZED USE. WE HAVE INVESTED IN BUILDING OUT ADDITIONAL INVENTORY PRIMARILY IN WHAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE OUR ACTIVE MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS PRIOR TO HAVING EXECUTED LEASES WITH RESPECT TO THIS SPACE. WE BELIEVE THAT DEMAND IN KEY METROPOLITAN AREAS SUCH AS NORTHERN VIRGINIA, DALLAS, SINGAPORE AND LONDON IS LARGELY IN LINE WITH SUPPLY. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO SEE STRONG DEMAND IN OTHER KEY METROPOLITAN AREAS ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO. HOWEVER, UNTIL THIS INVENTORY IS LEASED UP, WHICH WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING AVAILABLE DATA CENTER SPACE IN THESE METROPOLITAN AREAS, OUR RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. OUR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES MAKE US PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO GENERAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWNS, INCLUDING RECESSIONS AND THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER \u201cGLOBAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,\u201d AS WELL AS ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CORPORATE DATA CENTER, INTERNET AND DATA COMMUNICATIONS AND BROADER TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES. ANY SUCH SLOWDOWN OR ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT COULD LEAD TO REDUCED CORPORATE IT SPENDING OR REDUCED DEMAND FOR DATA CENTER SPACE. REDUCED DEMAND COULD ALSO RESULT FROM BUSINESS RELOCATIONS, INCLUDING TO METROPOLITAN AREAS THAT WE DO NOT CURRENTLY SERVE. CHANGES IN INDUSTRY PRACTICE OR IN TECHNOLOGY, SUCH AS VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGY, MORE EFFICIENT COMPUTING OR NETWORKING DEVICES, OR DEVICES THAT REQUIRE HIGHER POWER DENSITIES THAN TODAY\u2019S DEVICES, COULD ALSO REDUCE DEMAND FOR THE PHYSICAL DATA CENTER SPACE WE PROVIDE OR MAKE THE TENANT IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR FACILITIES OBSOLETE OR IN NEED OF SIGNIFICANT UPGRADES TO REMAIN VIABLE. IN ADDITION, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, THE ADOPTION OF NEW INDUSTRY STANDARDS OR OTHER FACTORS COULD RENDER MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 CURRENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OBSOLETE OR UNMARKETABLE AND CONTRIBUTE TO A DOWNTURN IN THEIR BUSINESSES, THEREBY INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY DEFAULT UNDER THEIR LEASES, BECOME INSOLVENT OR FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY. IN ADDITION, DEMAND FOR DATA CENTER SPACE, OR THE RATES AT WHICH WE LEASE SPACE, MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED EITHER ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO OR IN SPECIFIC METROPOLITAN AREAS AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, OR THE AMOUNT OF SPACE BEING OFFERED IN OUR METROPOLITAN AREAS AND OTHER METROPOLITAN AREAS BY OUR COMPETITORS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, OR GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES IN THE REPORTING PERIOD. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. WE HAVE PROVIDED A SUMMARY OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN ITEM 1, NOTE 2 \u201cSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d IN THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE DESCRIBE BELOW THOSE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REQUIRE MATERIAL SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS AND THAT HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THESE ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS, BASED UPON INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE REASONABLE AS OF THE DATE ON THE FRONT COVER OF THIS REPORT.  INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE  ACQUISITION OF REAL ESTATE.  THE PRICE THAT WE PAY TO ACQUIRE A PROPERTY IS IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS INCLUDING THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY AND IMPROVEMENTS, THE OCCUPANCY OF THE BUILDING, THE TERM AND RATE OF IN-PLACE LEASES, THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE CUSTOMERS, FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE FINANCING, ABOVE- OR BELOW-MARKET GROUND LEASES AND NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS.  ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENTS TO ALLOCATE THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID TO ACQUIRE INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE AMONG THE IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS INCLUDING INTANGIBLES AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BASED ON OUR ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THIS INCLUDES DETERMINING THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY AND IMPROVEMENTS, LAND, GROUND LEASES, IF ANY, AND TENANT IMPROVEMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE EVALUATE THE VALUE OF IN-PLACE LEASES ON OCCUPANCY AND MARKET RENT, THE VALUE OF THE TENANT RELATIONSHIPS, THE VALUE (OR NEGATIVE VALUE) OF ABOVE (OR BELOW) MARKET LEASES, ANY DEBT OR DEFERRED TAXES ASSUMED FROM THE SELLER OR LOANS MADE BY THE SELLER TO US AND ANY BUILDING LEASES ASSUMED FROM THE SELLER. EACH OF THESE ESTIMATES REQUIRES A GREAT DEAL OF JUDGMENT AND SOME OF THE ESTIMATES INVOLVE COMPLEX CALCULATIONS. THESE ALLOCATION ASSESSMENTS HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE WERE TO ALLOCATE MORE VALUE TO LAND, THERE WOULD BE NO DEPRECIATION WITH RESPECT TO SUCH AMOUNT. IF WE WERE TO ALLOCATE MORE VALUE TO THE PROPERTY AS OPPOSED TO ALLOCATING TO THE VALUE OF IN-PLACE  70  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TENANT LEASES, THIS AMOUNT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS AN EXPENSE OVER A MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. THIS POTENTIAL EFFECT OCCURS BECAUSE THE AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO PROPERTY ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE PROPERTY WHEREAS AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO IN-PLACE TENANT LEASES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED TERM (INCLUDING RENEWAL AND EXTENSION ASSUMPTIONS) OF THE LEASES. ADDITIONALLY, THE AMORTIZATION OF THE VALUE (OR NEGATIVE VALUE) ASSIGNED TO ABOVE (OR BELOW) MARKET RATE LEASES IS RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO RENTAL REVENUE AS COMPARED TO AMORTIZATION OF THE VALUE OF IN-PLACE TENANT LEASES AND TENANT RELATIONSHIPS, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE WILL RECEIVE OFFERS FROM THIRD PARTIES TO PURCHASE OUR PROPERTIES, EITHER SOLICITED OR UNSOLICITED. FOR THOSE OFFERS THAT WE ACCEPT, THE PROSPECTIVE BUYERS WILL USUALLY REQUIRE A DUE DILIGENCE PERIOD BEFORE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR MATTERS TO ARISE THAT RESULT IN THE WITHDRAWAL OR REJECTION OF THE OFFER DURING THIS PROCESS. WE CLASSIFY REAL ESTATE AS \u201cHELD FOR SALE\u201d WHEN ALL CRITERIA UNDER THE GAAP GUIDANCE HAVE BEEN MET.  ASSET IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION.  WE REVIEW EACH OF OUR PROPERTIES FOR INDICATORS THAT ITS CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. EXAMPLES OF SUCH INDICATORS MAY INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF THE PROPERTY, A CHANGE IN THE EXPECTED HOLDING PERIOD FOR THE PROPERTY, A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN HOW THE PROPERTY IS BEING USED OR EXPECTED TO BE USED BASED ON THE UNDERWRITING AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION, AN ACCUMULATION OF COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT ORIGINALLY EXPECTED FOR THE ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPERTY, OR A HISTORY OF OPERATING OR CASH FLOW LOSSES OF THE PROPERTY. WHEN SUCH IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS EXIST, WE REVIEW AN ESTIMATE OF THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS (EXCLUDING INTEREST CHARGES) EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT\u2019S USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION AND COMPARE THAT ESTIMATE TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. WE CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS FUTURE OPERATING INCOME, TRENDS AND PROSPECTS, AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF LEASING DEMAND, COMPETITION AND OTHER FACTORS. IF OUR FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOW EVALUATION INDICATES THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO RECOVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. THESE LOSSES HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR NET INCOME BECAUSE RECORDING AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS RESULTS IN AN IMMEDIATE NEGATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO NET INCOME. THE EVALUATION OF ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND IS BASED IN PART ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FUTURE OCCUPANCY, RENTAL RATES AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS. SINCE CASH FLOWS ON PROPERTIES CONSIDERED TO BE LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED ARE CONSIDERED ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CARRYING VALUE OF A PROPERTY IS RECOVERABLE, OUR STRATEGY OF HOLDING PROPERTIES OVER THE LONG-TERM DIRECTLY DECREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEIR CARRYING VALUES NOT BEING RECOVERABLE AND THEREFORE REQUIRING THE RECORDING OF AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS. IF OUR STRATEGY CHANGES OR MARKET CONDITIONS OTHERWISE DICTATE AN EARLIER SALE DATE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS MAY BE RECOGNIZED AND SUCH LOSS COULD BE MATERIAL. IF WE DETERMINE THAT THE ASSET FAILS THE RECOVERABILITY TEST, THE AFFECTED ASSETS MUST BE REDUCED TO THEIR FAIR VALUE.  WE GENERALLY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF RENTAL PROPERTIES UTILIZING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS THAT INCLUDES PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE REVENUES, EXPENSES AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT COSTS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD USE BASED ON THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF THE ASSET, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE INCOME APPROACH THAT IS COMMONLY UTILIZED BY APPRAISERS. IN CERTAIN CASES, WE MAY SUPPLEMENT THIS ANALYSIS BY OBTAINING OUTSIDE BROKER OPINIONS OF VALUE.  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION.  WE PERFORM AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR GOODWILL AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS, WE EVALUATE GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE.  IN OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS OF GOODWILL, WE FIRST ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE.  IF BASED ON THIS ASSESSMENT, WE DETERMINE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS NOT LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, THEN PERFORMING THE ADDITIONAL TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST IS UNNECESSARY. IF OUR QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT INDICATES THAT GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, WE PERFORM A TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT UNDER THE TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST BY FIRST COMPARING THE BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS INCLUDING GOODWILL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN THE BOOK VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL AND ITS CARRYING VALUE. WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH WE ACCOUNT FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH TOPIC 842 COMMENCING ON JANUARY 1, 2019 AND \u201cLEASES (TOPIC 840)\u201d PRIOR TO 2019. WE ACCOUNT FOR THE NON-LEASE COMPONENTS WITHIN OUR LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, AS WELL AS OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH \u201cREVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606)\u201d.  REVENUE RECOGNIZED AS A RESULT OF APPLYING TOPIC 842 AND 840 WAS 99% AND  97%  AND TOPIC 606 WAS LESS THAN 1% AND  3%  OF TOTAL OPERATING REVENUE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  71  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR LEASES ARE CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES AND MINIMUM RENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERMS OF THE LEASES, WHICH MAY SPAN MULTIPLE YEARS. THE EXCESS OF RENTS RECOGNIZED OVER AMOUNTS CONTRACTUALLY DUE PURSUANT TO THE UNDERLYING LEASES IS INCLUDED IN DEFERRED RENT IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND CONTRACTUALLY DUE BUT UNPAID RENTS ARE INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS AND OTHER RECEIVABLES.  TENANT REIMBURSEMENTS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE, AND OTHER RECOVERABLE COSTS UNDER OUR LEASES ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD THAT THE EXPENSES ARE INCURRED. LEASE TERMINATION FEES ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE LEASE, EFFECTIVE AS OF THE DATE THE LEASE MODIFICATION IS FINALIZED, ASSUMING COLLECTION IS NOT CONSIDERED DOUBTFUL. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE RECOGNIZE AMORTIZATION OF THE VALUE OF ACQUIRED ABOVE OR BELOW-MARKET TENANT LEASES AS A REDUCTION OF RENTAL REVENUE IN THE CASE OF ABOVE-MARKET LEASES OR AN INCREASE TO RENTAL REVENUE IN THE CASE OF BELOW-MARKET LEASES.  WE MUST MAKE SUBJECTIVE ESTIMATES AS TO WHEN OUR REVENUE IS EARNED AND THE COLLECTABILITY OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RELATED TO MINIMUM RENT, DEFERRED RENT, EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS, LEASE TERMINATION FEES AND OTHER INCOME. WE SPECIFICALLY ANALYZE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND HISTORICAL BAD DEBTS, CUSTOMER CONCENTRATIONS, CUSTOMER CREDITWORTHINESS AND CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS WHEN EVALUATING THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR BAD DEBTS. THESE ESTIMATES HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR NET REVENUE BECAUSE A HIGHER BAD DEBT ALLOWANCE WOULD RESULT IN LOWER NET REVENUE, AND RECOGNIZING RENTAL REVENUE AS EARNED IN ONE PERIOD VERSUS ANOTHER WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER OR LOWER NET REVENUE FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE PARENT COMPANY  IN THIS \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE PARENT COMPANY\u201d SECTION AND IN THE \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u201d SECTION BELOW, THE TERM OUR \u201cPARENT COMPANY\u201d REFERS TO DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. ON AN UNCONSOLIDATED BASIS, EXCLUDING OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  ANALYSIS OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PARENT COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS IS OPERATED PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, OF WHICH OUR PARENT COMPANY IS THE SOLE GENERAL PARTNER AND WHICH IT CONSOLIDATES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. BECAUSE OUR PARENT COMPANY OPERATES ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS WITH OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u201d SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS SECTION TO UNDERSTAND THE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF OUR PARENT COMPANY ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AND HOW OUR COMPANY IS OPERATED AS A WHOLE.  OUR PARENT COMPANY ISSUES PUBLIC EQUITY FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT GENERALLY DOES NOT OTHERWISE GENERATE ANY CAPITAL ITSELF OR CONDUCT ANY BUSINESS ITSELF, OTHER THAN INCURRING CERTAIN EXPENSES IN OPERATING AS A PUBLIC COMPANY WHICH ARE FULLY REIMBURSED BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. OUR PARENT COMPANY ITSELF DOES NOT HOLD ANY INDEBTEDNESS OTHER THAN GUARANTEES OF THE INDEBTEDNESS OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND ITS ONLY MATERIAL ASSET IS ITS OWNERSHIP OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. THEREFORE, THE CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF OUR PARENT COMPANY AND OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP ARE THE SAME ON THEIR RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, EXCEPT FOR IMMATERIAL DIFFERENCES RELATED TO CASH, OTHER ASSETS AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES THAT ARISE FROM PUBLIC COMPANY EXPENSES PAID BY OUR PARENT COMPANY. ALL DEBT IS HELD DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AT THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP LEVEL. OUR PARENT COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL FUNDING REQUIREMENT IS THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK. OUR PARENT COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ITS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IS DISTRIBUTIONS IT RECEIVES FROM OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  AS THE SOLE GENERAL PARTNER OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, OUR PARENT COMPANY HAS THE FULL, EXCLUSIVE AND COMPLETE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL. OUR PARENT COMPANY CAUSES OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO DISTRIBUTE SUCH PORTION OF ITS AVAILABLE CASH AS OUR PARENT COMPANY MAY IN ITS DISCRETION DETERMINE, IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT. OUR PARENT COMPANY RECEIVES PROCEEDS FROM ITS EQUITY ISSUANCES FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT IS GENERALLY REQUIRED BY OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT TO CONTRIBUTE THE PROCEEDS FROM ITS EQUITY ISSUANCES TO OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP IN EXCHANGE FOR PARTNERSHIP UNITS OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  OUR PARENT COMPANY IS A WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER WITH AN EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED ON SEPTEMBER 22, 2017, WHICH ALLOWS OUR PARENT COMPANY TO REGISTER AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF VARIOUS CLASSES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, OUR PARENT COMPANY MAY ISSUE EQUITY FROM TIME TO TIME ON AN OPPORTUNISTIC BASIS, DEPENDENT UPON MARKET CONDITIONS AND AVAILABLE PRICING. ANY PROCEEDS FROM SUCH EQUITY ISSUANCES WOULD GENERALLY BE CONTRIBUTED TO OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP IN EXCHANGE FOR ADDITIONAL EQUITY INTERESTS IN OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP MAY USE THE PROCEEDS TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES, TO FUND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND FOR GENERAL WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES, INCLUDING POTENTIALLY FOR THE REPURCHASE, REDEMPTION OR RETIREMENT OF OUTSTANDING DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES.  THE LIQUIDITY OF OUR PARENT COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S ABILITY TO MAKE SUFFICIENT DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PARENT COMPANY. THE PRIMARY CASH REQUIREMENT OF OUR PARENT COMPANY IS ITS PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS. OUR PARENT COMPANY ALSO GUARANTEES OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 AND AFFILIATES\u2019, UNSECURED DEBT. IF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP OR SUCH SUBSIDIARIES FAIL TO FULFILL THEIR DEBT REQUIREMENTS, WHICH TRIGGER PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS, THEN OUR PARENT COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL ITS CASH PAYMENT COMMITMENTS UNDER SUCH GUARANTEES. HOWEVER, OUR PARENT COMPANY\u2019S ONLY MATERIAL ASSET IS ITS INVESTMENT IN OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  WE BELIEVE OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S SOURCES OF WORKING CAPITAL, SPECIFICALLY ITS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AND FUNDS AVAILABLE UNDER ITS GLOBAL REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ARE ADEQUATE FOR IT TO MAKE ITS DISTRIBUTION PAYMENTS TO OUR PARENT COMPANY AND, IN TURN, FOR OUR PARENT COMPANY TO MAKE ITS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S SOURCES OF CAPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE AT ALL OR IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS NEEDS, INCLUDING MAKING DISTRIBUTION PAYMENTS TO OUR PARENT COMPANY. THE LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S ABILITY TO PAY ITS DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PARENT COMPANY, WHICH WOULD IN TURN, ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PARENT COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS.  76  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON JANUARY 4, 2019, OUR PARENT COMPANY ENTERED INTO EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS, WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE 2019 EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS, WITH EACH OF MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED, BARCLAYS CAPITAL INC., BTIG, LLC, CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES INC., J.P.

FUTURE USES OF CASH  OUR PARENT COMPANY MAY FROM TIME TO TIME SEEK TO RETIRE, REDEEM OR REPURCHASE ITS EQUITY OR THE DEBT SECURITIES OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES THROUGH CASH PURCHASES AND/OR EXCHANGES FOR EQUITY SECURITIES IN OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS OR OTHERWISE. SUCH REPURCHASES, REDEMPTIONS OR EXCHANGES, IF ANY, WILL DEPEND ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS OR OTHER FACTORS.

WHILE HISTORICALLY OUR PARENT COMPANY HAS SATISFIED THIS DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT BY MAKING CASH DISTRIBUTIONS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS, IT MAY CHOOSE TO SATISFY THIS REQUIREMENT BY MAKING DISTRIBUTIONS OF CASH OR OTHER PROPERTY. ALL SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS ARE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR PARENT COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OUR PARENT COMPANY CONSIDERS MARKET FACTORS AND OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S PERFORMANCE IN ADDITION TO REIT REQUIREMENTS IN DETERMINING DISTRIBUTION LEVELS. OUR PARENT COMPANY HAS DISTRIBUTED AT LEAST 100% OF ITS TAXABLE INCOME ANNUALLY SINCE INCEPTION TO MINIMIZE CORPORATE LEVEL FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. AMOUNTS ACCUMULATED FOR DISTRIBUTION TO STOCKHOLDERS ARE INVESTED PRIMARILY IN INTEREST-BEARING ACCOUNTS AND SHORT-TERM INTEREST-BEARING SECURITIES, WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR INTENTION TO MAINTAIN OUR PARENT COMPANY\u2019S STATUS AS A REIT.  AS A RESULT OF THIS DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT, OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP CANNOT RELY ON RETAINED EARNINGS TO FUND ITS ON-GOING OPERATIONS TO THE SAME EXTENT THAT OTHER COMPANIES WHOSE PARENT COMPANIES ARE NOT REITS CAN. OUR PARENT COMPANY MAY NEED TO CONTINUE TO RAISE CAPITAL IN THE DEBT AND EQUITY MARKETS TO FUND OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS AT NEW OR EXISTING PROPERTIES, ACQUISITIONS OR INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING OR NEWLY CREATED JOINT VENTURES. IN ADDITION, OUR PARENT COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO USE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR GLOBAL REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, IF NECESSARY, TO MEET REIT DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS AND MAINTAIN OUR PARENT COMPANY\u2019S REIT STATUS.

AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  $123.9 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, EXCLUDING $10.1 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH.

DATA CENTER CONSTRUCTION INCLUDES  2.7 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF TURN KEY FLEX  \u00ae  AND POWERED BASE BUILDING  \u00ae  PRODUCT. GENERALLY, WE EXPECT TO DELIVER THE SPACE WITHIN 12 MONTHS; HOWEVER, LEASE COMMENCEMENT DATES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT FINAL DELIVERY SCHEDULES. EQUIPMENT POOL AND OTHER INVENTORY REPRESENT THE VALUE OF LONG-LEAD EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR TIMELY DEPLOYMENT AND DELIVERY OF DATA CENTER CONSTRUCTION FIT-OUT. CAMPUS, TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER COSTS INCLUDE THE VALUE OF DEVELOPMENT WORK WHICH BENEFITS SPACE RECENTLY CONVERTED TO OUR OPERATING PORTFOLIO AND IS COMPOSED PRIMARILY OF SHARED INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND FIRST-GENERATION TENANT IMPROVEMENTS.  FUTURE USES OF CASH  OUR PROPERTIES REQUIRE PERIODIC INVESTMENTS OF CAPITAL FOR TENANT-RELATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND FOR GENERAL CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  3.2 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROXIMATELY  2.1 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT. TURN-KEY FLEX  \u00ae  SPACE IS MOVE-IN-READY SPACE FOR THE PLACEMENT OF COMPUTER AND NETWORK EQUIPMENT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A DATA CENTER ENVIRONMENT. DEPENDING ON DEMAND FOR ADDITIONAL TURN-KEY FLEX  \u00ae  SPACE, WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT TENANT IMPROVEMENT COSTS TO BUILD OUT AND DEVELOP THESE TYPES OF SPACES. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE APPROXIMATE  3.2 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION FOR TURN-KEY FLEX  \u00ae  AND POWERED BASE BUILDING  \u00ae  PRODUCTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE INCOME PRODUCING ON OR AFTER COMPLETION, IN  FOUR  U.S. METROPOLITAN AREAS,  FOUR  EUROPEAN METROPOLITAN AREAS,  TWO  ASIAN METROPOLITAN AREAS,  ONE  AUSTRALIAN METROPOLITAN AREAS AND  ONE  CANADIAN METROPOLITAN AREA, CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY  1.8 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF BASE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND  0.9 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF DATA CENTER CONSTRUCTION. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD OPEN COMMITMENTS, RELATED TO CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $376.3 MILLION  , INCLUDING AMOUNTS REIMBURSABLE OF APPROXIMATELY  $22.0 MILLION.  79  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY  $0.9 BILLION  TO  $1.1 BILLION  OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019, ALTHOUGH THIS AMOUNT MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE, POTENTIALLY MATERIALLY, BASED ON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN DEMAND, LEASING RESULTS AND AVAILABILITY OF DEBT OR EQUITY CAPITAL.  HISTORICAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (CASH BASIS)  THE TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE ACTIVITY FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  (IN THOUSANDS).

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ON OUR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS PLUS OUR ENHANCEMENT AND IMPROVEMENTS PROJECTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WERE APPROXIMATELY  $329.1 MILLION  , WHICH REFLECTS AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  39%  FROM THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SPENDING FOR GROUND-UP DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS (INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ACQUIRED IN THE DFT MERGER) AND BASE BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS. OUR DEVELOPMENT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE GENERALLY FUNDED BY OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND EQUITY AND DEBT CAPITAL.  INDIRECT COSTS, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED INTEREST, CAPITALIZED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018 WERE $22.1 MILLION AND $25.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. CAPITALIZED INTEREST COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY $10.9 MILLION AND $7.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE TOTAL INDIRECT COSTS CAPITALIZED FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  .

SEE \u201c\u2014FUTURE USES OF CASH\u201d ABOVE FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WE EXPECT TO INCUR DURING THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019.  WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE COMMITMENTS DISCUSSED BELOW UNDER \u201cOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\u201d AND \u201cDISTRIBUTIONS.\u201d  CONSISTENT WITH OUR GROWTH STRATEGY, WE ACTIVELY PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS, WITH DUE DILIGENCE AND NEGOTIATIONS OFTEN AT DIFFERENT STAGES AT DIFFERENT TIMES. THE DOLLAR VALUE OF ACQUISITIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019 WILL BE BASED ON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING TENANT DEMAND, LEASING RESULTS, AVAILABILITY OF DEBT OR EQUITY CAPITAL AND ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES.  WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME SEEK TO RETIRE OR REPURCHASE OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT OR THE EQUITY OF OUR PARENT COMPANY THROUGH CASH PURCHASES AND/OR EXCHANGES FOR EQUITY SECURITIES OF OUR PARENT COMPANY IN OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS OR OTHERWISE. SUCH REPURCHASES OR EXCHANGES, IF ANY, WILL DEPEND ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS OR OTHER FACTORS. THE AMOUNTS INVOLVED MAY BE MATERIAL.  WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING TO PAY FOR SCHEDULED DEBT MATURITIES AND TO FUND ACQUISITIONS AND NON-RECURRING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, WITH NET CASH FROM OPERATIONS, FUTURE LONG-TERM SECURED AND UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS AND THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES AND THE PROCEEDS OF EQUITY ISSUANCES BY OUR PARENT COMPANY. WE ALSO MAY FUND FUTURE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND NON-RECURRING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, USING OUR GLOBAL REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PENDING PERMANENT FINANCING.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN OPERATING PARTNERSHIP  NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS RELATE TO THE COMMON UNITS IN OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP THAT ARE NOT OWNED BY DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC., WHICH, AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , AMOUNTED TO  4.4%  OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP COMMON UNITS. HISTORICALLY, OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS ISSUED COMMON UNITS TO THIRD PARTY SELLERS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF REAL ESTATE INTERESTS FROM SUCH THIRD PARTIES.  LIMITED PARTNERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO REDEEM PART OR ALL OF THEIR COMMON UNITS FOR CASH BASED UPON THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF SHARES OF DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME OF THE REDEMPTION. ALTERNATIVELY, WE MAY ELECT TO ACQUIRE THOSE COMMON UNITS IN EXCHANGE FOR SHARES OF DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. COMMON STOCK ON A ONE-FOR-ONE BASIS, SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT IN THE EVENT OF STOCK SPLITS, STOCK DIVIDENDS, ISSUANCE OF STOCK RIGHTS, SPECIFIED EXTRAORDINARY DISTRIBUTIONS AND SIMILAR EVENTS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE DFT MERGER, APPROXIMATELY 0.2 MILLION COMMON UNITS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP WERE ISSUED TO CERTAIN FORMER UNITHOLDERS IN THE DFT OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AND, ACCORDINGLY, ARE NOT PRESENTED AS PERMANENT CAPITAL IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.  INFLATION  MANY OF OUR LEASES PROVIDE FOR SEPARATE REAL ESTATE TAX AND OPERATING EXPENSE ESCALATIONS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE LEASES PROVIDE FOR FIXED BASE RENT INCREASES. WE BELIEVE THAT INFLATIONARY INCREASES MAY BE AT LEAST PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CONTRACTUAL RENT INCREASES AND EXPENSE ESCALATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS  WE CALCULATE FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, OR FFO, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (NAREIT). FFO REPRESENTS NET INCOME (LOSS) (COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP), EXCLUDING GAINS (OR LOSSES) FROM SALES OF PROPERTY, A GAIN FROM A PRE-EXISTING RELATIONSHIP, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND REAL ESTATE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS) AND AFTER ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES. MANAGEMENT USES FFO AS A SUPPLEMENTAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE BECAUSE, IN EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND GAINS AND LOSSES FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS AND AFTER ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES, IT PROVIDES A PERFORMANCE MEASURE THAT, WHEN COMPARED YEAR OVER YEAR, CAPTURES TRENDS IN OCCUPANCY RATES, RENTAL RATES AND OPERATING COSTS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT, AS A WIDELY RECOGNIZED MEASURE OF THE PERFORMANCE OF REITS, FFO WILL BE USED BY INVESTORS AS A BASIS TO COMPARE OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE WITH THAT OF OTHER REITS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE FFO EXCLUDES DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND CAPTURES NEITHER THE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF OUR PROPERTIES THAT RESULT FROM USE OR MARKET CONDITIONS, NOR THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND CAPITALIZED LEASING COMMISSIONS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPERTIES, ALL OF WHICH HAVE REAL ECONOMIC EFFECT AND COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS, THE UTILITY OF FFO AS A MEASURE OF OUR PERFORMANCE IS LIMITED. OTHER REITS MAY NOT CALCULATE FFO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NAREIT DEFINITION AND, ACCORDINGLY, OUR FFO MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO  83  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SUCH OTHER REITS\u2019 FFO. FFO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY AS A SUPPLEMENT TO NET INCOME COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AS A MEASURE OF OUR PERFORMANCE.

(REFERRED TO HEREIN AS \u201cWE\u201d, \u201cUS\u201d, AND \u201cOUR\u201d), TOGETHER WITH ITS WHOLLY-OWNED  AND MAJORITY-OWNED CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARIES IS A GLOBAL CLEAN ENERGY COMPANY THAT OWNS PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY, SES GASIFICATION  TECHNOLOGY (\u201cSGT\u201d), FOR THE LOW-COST AND ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTION OF SYNTHESIS GAS (REFERRED TO AS \u201cSYNGAS\u201d).  OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN ON COMMERCIALIZING OUR TECHNOLOGY BOTH IN CHINA AND GLOBALLY THROUGH THE REGIONAL BUSINESS PLATFORMS WE HAVE  CREATED WITH PARTNERS IN AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIAN FUTURE ENERGY PTY LTD (\u201cAFE\u201d), AND IN POLAND, SES ENCOAL ENERGY SP.  Z O.O (\u201cSEE\u201d).  OVER  THE PAST TEN YEARS, WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED OUR TECHNOLOGY INTO FIVE INDUSTRIAL SCALE PROJECTS IN CHINA. WE INVESTED IN  TWO OF THOSE INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS AND HAVE LICENSED OUR TECHNOLOGY INTO THE REMAINING THREE. TODAY, FOUR OF THESE PROJECTS ARE  OPERATING AND ARE SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATING OUR TECHNOLOGY. OUR FIRST PROJECT, THE SMALLER SCALE SYNTHESIS ENERGY SYSTEMS (ZAO  ZHANG) NEW GAS COMPANY LTD (\u201cZZ\u201d) COMMERCIAL DEMONSTRATION PLANT, OPERATED FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND ALSO SUCCESSFULLY  DEMONSTRATED OUR TECHNOLOGY AND WAS RETIRED IN 2015.  THROUGH  2018, OUR BUSINESS MODEL HAD BEEN TO CREATE VALUE FROM OUR TECHNOLOGY IN CHINA, THROUGH TSEC, IN AUSTRALIA THROUGH AFE, IN POLAND  THROUGH SEE AND FROM LICENSING OUR TECHNOLOGY GLOBALLY INTO PROJECTS IN REGIONS SUCH AS BRAZIL AND INDIA. HOWEVER, WE HAVE DETERMINED  THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE CASH TO CONTINUE THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF SGT AND IS NOW UNDERTAKING STEPS TO REDUCE OUR EXPENDITURES.  IN THE CURRENT QUARTER, WE HAVE SUSPENDED OUR GLOBAL SGT COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS AND WE HAVE SEVERED MOST OF OUR SGT TECHNOLOGY  RESOURCES.  ON  MARCH 29, 2019, CLARKSONS PLATOU SECURITIES, INC. (\u201cCPS\u201d) WAS ENGAGED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ACT AS OUR FINANCIAL  ADVISOR. CPS WILL ADVISE US AS IT CONDUCTS A PROCESS TO EVALUATE FINANCING OPTIONS AND STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS BUT NOT  LIMITED TO A STRATEGIC MERGER, A SALE, A RECAPITALIZATION AND/OR A FINANCING CONSISTING OF EQUITY AND/OR DEBT SECURITIES. WE REMAIN  FOCUSED ON MAXIMIZING SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF OUR DEBTHOLDERS. A DEFINITIVE TIMETABLE FOR COMPLETION  OF THE EVALUATION OF FINANCING AND STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES HAS NOT BEEN SET AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE PROCESS WILL  RESULT IN ANY TRANSACTION BEING ANNOUNCED OR COMPLETED IN THE FUTURE.  ON  APRIL 4, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A TECHNOLOGY PURCHASE OPTION AGREEMENT (THE \u201cAGREEMENT\u201d) WITH AFE. UNDER THE TERMS  OF THE AGREEMENT, AFE HAS AN EXCLUSIVE OPTION THROUGH JULY 31, 2019 TO PURCHASE 100% OWNERSHIP OF SYNTHESIS ENERGY SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY,  LLC, OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY WHICH OWNS OUR INTEREST IN THE SGT. IN ADDITION, OWNERSHIP RIGHTS TO SGT ARE CARVED OUT OF THE  TRANSACTION AND RETAINED BY US FOR CHINA AND WE HAVE A THREE-YEAR OPTION PERIOD POST-CLOSING TO MONETIZE SGT FOR INDIA, BRAZIL,  POLAND AND FOR THE DRI TECHNOLOGY MARKET SEGMENT. WE INTEND TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS IN THESE CARVED OUT REGIONS  TO SEEK MUTUALLY AGREEABLE TERMS UNDER WHICH SGT CAN BE UTILIZED IN THOSE REGIONS.  AFE  ISSUED ONE MILLION SHARES TO US IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE AGREEMENT. AFE WOULD ALSO PAY (I) AN ADDITIONAL $2.0 MILLION  IN THREE EQUAL INSTALLMENTS, WITH THE FIRST INSTALLMENT PAID AT CLOSING AND THE REMAINDER OVER THE SUBSEQUENT TWELVE MONTHS, AND  (II) $3.8 MILLION ON THE EARLIER OF THE CLOSING OF A CONTRUCTION FINANCING BY AFE OR FIVE YEARS FROM CLOSING. THE CLOSING OF THE  TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO THE NEGOTIATION OF DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER CONDITIONS SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION  TO THE PAYMENT SCHEDULE ABOVE, AFE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL ONE MILLION SHARES WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE AGREEMENT AND WOULD ALSO  PAY AN ADDITIONAL $100,000 WITH THE FIRST INSTALLMENT PAID AT CLOSING AS FULL AND FINAL SETTLEMENT OF OUTSTANDING INVOICES OWING  AFE TO US AT THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT.  CURRENTLY,  AFE IS DEVELOPING ENERGY AND RESOURCE PROJECTS WITH WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE NECESSARY COMMERCIAL AND FINANCING STRUCTURES TO  DELIVER ATTRACTIVE FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE OWN APPROXIMATELY 36% OF AFE. AFE IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS GLADSTONE  ENERGY AND AMMONIA PROJECT AND THE RAISING OF FUNDS THAT WOULD ALLOW THIS PROJECT TO ADVANCE INTO FRONT-END ENGINEERING DESIGN  (FEED) AND WOULD ALLOW AFE TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE OF SYNTHESIS ENERGY SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY, LLC FROM THE COMPANY.  WE  OPERATE OUR BUSINESS FROM OUR HEADQUARTERS LOCATED IN HOUSTON, TEXAS AND OUR OFFICE IN SHANGHAI, CHINA.  28  OUTLOOK  AS  OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD $2.4 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND A NEGATIVE $4.7 MILLION OF WORKING CAPITAL. THE NEGATIVE  WORKING CAPITAL IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF THE SENIOR SECURED DEBENTURES (THE \u201cDEBENTURES\u201d) FROM  A NONCURRENT TO A CURRENT LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH A TECHNICAL DEFAULT.  AS  OF MAY 13, 2019, WE HAD $1.8 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. OF THE $1.8 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, $1.7 MILLION  RESIDES IN THE UNITED STATES OR EASILY ACCESSED FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND APPROXIMATELY $0.1 MILLION RESIDES IN CHINA.  IN  THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE UNDERTOOK ADDITIONAL STEPS TO REDUCE OUR OVERHEAD EXPENSES THROUGH THE TERMINATION OF CERTAIN  TECHNOLOGY AND ADMINISTRATIVE EMPLOYEES AND OTHER REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OFFICE EXPENSES AND PROFESSIONAL FEES.  ON  FEBRUARY 8, 2019, DELOME FAIR, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER OF THE COMPANY, NOTIFIED  THE COMPANY OF HER INTENTION TO RESIGN AS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AND AS A DIRECTOR ON THE BOARD EFFECTIVE MARCH  1, 2019. ROBERT RIGDON, VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND THE FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE COMPANY SUCCEEDED MS. FAIR AS  PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER. MS. FAIR\u2019S EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY  AS OF FEBRUARY 2016 WAS ALSO TERMINATED EFFECTIVE AS SUCH DATE.  AS  NOTED ABOVE, CPS HAS BEEN ENGAGED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ACT AS OUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO ADVISE THE COMPANY AS IT CONDUCTS  A PROCESS TO EVALUATE FINANCING OPTIONS AND STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS BUT NOT LIMITED TO A STRATEGIC MERGER, A SALE, A RECAPITALIZATION  AND/OR A FINANCING CONSISTING OF EQUITY AND/OR DEBT SECURITIES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE UNDERTAKING FURTHER EXPENSE REDUCTIONS WHICH  WE EXPECT TO BE REALIZED OVER THE REMAINDER OF CALENDAR YEAR 2019 TO IMPROVE OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND PRESERVE OUR AVAILABLE  CASH TO ALLOW MORE TIME TO COMPLETE THE FINANCING AND STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS EVALUATION WORK.  AS  PART OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, WE INTEND TO (I) WORK WITH CPS TO COMPLETE THE EVALUATION OF FINANCING OPTIONS  AND STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR THE COMPANY; (II) MONITOR SUPPORT AND FACILITATE OUR MINORITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN BFR IN ORDER  TO REALIZE THE FINANCIAL VALUE THROUGH DIVIDEND INCOME OR OTHER MEANS; (III) WORK TO RECOVER CASH AND MONETIZE OUR YIMA JOINT  VENTURE AND TSEC JOINT VENTURE OPERATIONS SUCH AS THROUGH A RESTRUCTURING OR DIVESTITURE; AND (IV) TAKING ANY ADDITIONAL STEPS  TO UTILIZE OUR EXISTING CASH RESERVES IN THE MOST FINANCIALLY PRODUCTIVE MEANS POSSIBLE.  WE  BELIEVE THAT WITH THE STRATEGIES ABOVE, WE CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE FOR THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS. BASED ON THE UNCERTAINTY OF OUR PLANS  TO IMPROVE OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, OUR HISTORICAL NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS , OUR CONTINUED LIMITED CASH INFLOWS AND THE POTENTIAL  UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING TRANSFERRING OUR FUNDS FROM CHINA TO THE U.S., THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY  TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, AS DISCLOSED IN OUR PRIOR PERIODIC REPORTS.  WE  CURRENTLY PLAN TO USE OUR AVAILABLE CASH FOR: (I) EVALUATING AND IMPLEMENTING FINANCING, DIVESTITURES AND STRATEGIC RESTRUCTURING  OPTIONS; (II) PAYING THE INTEREST RELATED TO THE DEBENTURES; AND (III) WORKING CAPITAL FOR GENERAL CORPORATE AND ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES.  WE  CURRENTLY HAVE VERY LIMITED FINANCIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES TO FULLY IMPLEMENT OUR PLANS AND DUE TO EMPLOYEE RESOURCE REDUCTIONS  AND WE HAVE SUSPENDED OUR SGT COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS. WE CAN MAKE NO ASSURANCES THAT AFE AND OUR OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS  INCLUDING ANY POTENTIAL RETURN FROM BFR WILL PROVIDE US WITH SUFFICIENT AND TIMELY CASH FLOWS TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS.  AS  NOTED ABOVE, WE ARE SEEKING TO IMPROVE OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND WE MAY CHOOSE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THROUGH ALTERNATIVES  SUCH AS EQUITY AND DEBT FINANCING, DIVESTING CERTAIN ASSETS SUCH AS OUR INTERESTS IN OUR YIMA JOINT VENTURE, OUR TSEC JOINT VENTURE,  AND OUR TECHNOLOGY, AND/OR RESTRUCTURING THE COMPANY. WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THESE ALTERNATIVES WILL BE AVAILABLE  TO US IN THE FUTURE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. ANY SUCH ALTERNATIVE COULD BE DILUTIVE TO OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS AND DEBTHOLDERS.  IF WE CANNOT RAISE REQUIRED FUNDS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY FURTHER SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE OUR EXPENSES AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE  TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) SUSTAIN OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES; (II) FUND CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS AS THEY BECOME DUE  INCLUDING LICENSE FEES AND OTHER VENDOR PAYMENTS; (III) RESPOND TO UNANTICIPATED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS; OR (IV) REPAY OUR INDEBTEDNESS.  IN ADDITION, WE MAY BE FORCED TO SEEK RELIEF TO AVOID OR END INSOLVENCY THROUGH OTHER PROCEEDINGS INCLUDING BANKRUPTCY.  29  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  THREE  MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 (\u201cCURRENT QUARTER\u201d) COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 (\u201cCOMPARABLE  QUARTER\u201d)  REVENUE.  THERE WAS NO REVENUE FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER AS COMPARED TO $0.8 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE QUARTER. THE COMPARABLE QUARTER REVENUE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $0.6 MILLION OF PAYMENTS OF PAST DUE INVOICES RELATED TO TECHNICAL CONSULTING AND ENGINEERING SERVICES PROVIDED  TO OUR YIMA JOINT VENTURE DURING THE CONSTRUCTION AND COMMISSIONING PERIOD, AND $0.2 MILLION FROM A THIRD-PARTY CUSTOMER RELATED  TO THEIR FEASIBILITY STUDY.  COSTS  OF SALES EXPENSES.  TOTAL COSTS OF SALES EXPENSES WERE ZERO FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER AS COMPARED TO $0.2 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE  QUARTER.

STOCK-BASED EXPENSE WAS $3,000 FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER AS COMPARED TO $0.4 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE QUARTER. THE  DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FACT THAT NO NEW STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS WERE ISSUED DURING THE CURRENT QUARTER AS COMPARED  WITH THE COMPARABLE QUARTER.  DEPRECIATION  AND AMORTIZATION.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE WAS $7,000 FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER AS COMPARED WITH $9,000 FOR THE  COMPARABLE QUARTER, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATES TO THE AMORTIZATION OF OUR GLOBAL PATENTS.

THE NET GAIN ON FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES WAS  APPROXIMATELY $0.2 MILLION FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER AS COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY $34,000 FOR THE COMPARABLE QUARTER. THIS RESULTED  FROM THE LOWER FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR OUR WARRANTS ISSUED TO THE DEBENTURES INVESTORS AND THE PLACEMENT AGENT AS OF MARCH 31, 2019  VERSUS THE FAIR MARKET VALUE AS OF MARCH 31, 2018. THE CHANGE IN THE DERIVATIVE LIABILITY WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO MOVEMENTS IN THE  COMPANY\u2019S STOCK PRICE. OTHER CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME, INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND STOCK  MARKET VOLATILITY.  INTEREST  EXPENSE  . INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $0.3 MILLION FOR BOTH THE CURRENT QUARTER AND THE COMPARABLE QUARTER, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DUE  TO THE INTEREST RELATED TO THE DEBENTURES AND THE AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AND ISSUANCE COSTS FOR THE DEBENTURES ISSUED IN  OCTOBER 2017.  FOREIGN  CURRENCY GAIN  . FOREIGN CURRENCY GAIN WAS APPROXIMATELY $29,000 FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER AS COMPARED WITH A GAIN OF $0.1 MILLION  FOR THE COMPARABLE QUARTER. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY GAIN OF BOTH QUARTERS WERE THE RESULT OF APPRECIATION OF THE CHINESE RENMINBI  YUAN (\u201cRMB\u201d) TO THE U.S. DOLLAR DURING THE CURRENT QUARTER AND COMPARABLE QUARTER.  NINE  MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 (\u201cCURRENT PERIOD\u201d) COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 (\u201cCOMPARABLE  PERIOD\u201d)  REVENUE.

GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $4.7 MILLION IN THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED WITH $4.4  MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD. THE $0.3 MILLION INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE INCREASED ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNT  RECEIVABLES, WHICH WAS OFFSET IN PART BY THE REDUCTION OF EMPLOYEE RELATED COMPENSATION COSTS.  STOCK-BASED  EXPENSE  . STOCK-BASED EXPENSE WAS $0.3 MILLION FOR THE CURRENT PERIOD AS COMPARED TO $0.9 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD.  THE DECREASE OF $0.6 MILLION WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A DECREASE IN THE VALUE AND NUMBER OF STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS ISSUED DURING  THE CURRENT PERIOD AS COMPARED WITH THE COMPARABLE PERIOD.

LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS  OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD $2.4 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND A NEGATIVE $4.7 MILLION OF WORKING CAPITAL. THE NEGATIVE  WORKING CAPITAL IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF THE DEBENTURES FROM A NONCURRENT TO A CURRENT LIABILITY IN CONNECTION  WITH A TECHNICAL DEFAULT DISCUSSED BELOW.  AS  OF MAY 13, 2019, WE HAD $1.8 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. OF THE $1.8 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, $1.7 MILLION  RESIDES IN THE UNITED STATES OR EASILY ACCESSED FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND APPROXIMATELY $0.1 MILLION RESIDES IN CHINA.  ON  OCTOBER 24, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cPURCHASE AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH CERTAIN ACCREDITED  INVESTORS (THE \u201cPURCHASERS\u201d) FOR THE PURCHASE OF $8.0 IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR SECURED DEBENTURES (THE \u201cDEBENTURES\u201d).  THE DEBENTURES HAVE A TERM OF 5 YEARS WITH AN INTEREST RATE OF 11% THAT ADJUSTS TO 18% PER ANNUM IN THE EVENT THE COMPANY DEFAULTS  ON AN INTEREST PAYMENT. THE DEBENTURES REQUIRE THAT DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM BFR ARE USED TO PAY DOWN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS OF  OUTSTANDING DEBENTURES. ADDITIONALLY, WE ISSUED WARRANTS TO PURCHASE 1,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT $4.00 PER COMMON SHARE.  THE NET OFFERING PROCEEDS TO US FROM THE SALE OF THE DEBENTURES AND WARRANTS, AFTER DEDUCTING THE PLACEMENT AGENT\u2019S FEE  AND ASSOCIATED COSTS AND EXPENSES, WAS APPROXIMATELY $7.4 MILLION, NOT INCLUDING THE PROCEEDS, IF ANY, FROM THE EXERCISE OF THE  WARRANTS ISSUED IN THIS THE OFFERING. THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND THE DEBENTURES CONTAIN CERTAIN CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES  AND COVENANTS. THERE ARE NO FINANCIAL METRIC COVENANTS RELATED TO THE DEBENTURES. THE TRANSACTION WAS APPROVED BY A SPECIAL COMMITTEE  OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DUE TO THE FACT THAT CERTAIN BOARD MEMBERS WERE PURCHASERS. INTEREST ON THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF DEBENTURES  IS PAYABLE QUARTERLY. ALL UNPAID PRINCIPAL AND INTERESTS ON THE DEBENTURES WILL BE DUE ON OCTOBER 23, 2022.  31  ON  NOVEMBER 5, 2018, A DEFAULT OCCURRED RELATED TO THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND THE DEBENTURES DUE TO THE COMPANY FAILING TO FILE ITS  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K ON TIME. IF THE DEFAULT IS NOT WAIVED BY THE HOLDERS OF THE DEBENTURES, THE HOLDERS MAY HAVE THE OPTION  TO ACCELERATE THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST OUTSTANDING AND OTHER MANDATORY CHARGES ON THE DEBENTURES. THE DEFAULT HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED  AT THE TIME OF FILING THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE RECLASSIFIED THE DEBENTURE LIABILITIES FROM  NONCURRENT LIABILITIES TO CURRENT LIABILITIES.  THE  FOLLOWING SUMMARIZES THE SOURCES AND USES OF CASH DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD.  \u25cf  OPERATING  ACTIVITIES: DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD, WE USED $4.7 MILLION IN CASH FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO $4.9 MILLION DURING  THE COMPARABLE PERIOD. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN EMPLOYEE RELATED COMPENSATION COSTS.  \u25cf  INVESTING  ACTIVITIES: DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD, WE USED APPROXIMATELY $11,000 TO INVEST IN OUR SEE JOINT VENTURE AND RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY  $1,000 FOR DISPOSAL OF FIXED ASSETS IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES. DURING THE COMPARABLE PERIOD, WE HAD A NET SOURCE OF CASH OF  $1.1 MILLION IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WHICH INCLUDED $1.7 MILLION PROCEEDS FROM THE TIANWO-SES JOINT VENTURE SHARE TRANSFER,  AND $0.6 MILLION ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN OUR AFE AND SEE JOINT VENTURES.  \u25cf  FINANCING  ACTIVITIES: THERE WAS NO FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE CURRENT PERIOD. DURING THE COMPARABLE PERIOD, WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS  OF $7.4 MILLION FROM ISSUANCE OF THE DEBENTURES AND PAID LEGAL FEES OF $0.2 MILLION RELATED TO ISSUANCE COSTS OF THE DEBENTURES.  CURRENT  PROJECTS  AUSTRALIAN  FUTURE ENERGY PTY LTD  IN  2014, WE ESTABLISHED AFE TOGETHER WITH AN AUSTRALIAN COMPANY, AMBRE INVESTMENTS PTY LIMITED (\u201cAMBRE\u201d). AFE IS AN INDEPENDENTLY  MANAGED AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS PLATFORM ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF BUILDING A LARGE-SCALE, VERTICALLY INTEGRATED BUSINESS IN  AUSTRALIA BASED ON DEVELOPING, BUILDING AND OWNING EQUITY INTERESTS IN FINANCIALLY ATTRACTIVE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE  PROJECTS THAT PRODUCE LOW-COST SYNGAS AS A COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVE TO EXPENSIVE LOCAL NATURAL GAS AND LNG.  ON  MAY 10, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A PROJECT TECHNOLOGY LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH AFE IN CONNECTION WITH A PROJECT BEING DEVELOPED BY  AFE IN QUEENSLAND AUSTRALIA. AFE INTENDS TO FORM A SUBSIDIARY PROJECT COMPANY AND ASSIGN THE PROJECT TECHNOLOGY LICENSE AGREEMENT  TO THAT COMPANY WHICH WILL ASSUME ALL OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF AFE THEREUNDER. PURSUANT TO THE PROJECT TECHNOLOGY LICENSE AGREEMENT,  WE GRANTED A NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO USE OUR TECHNOLOGY AT THE PROJECT TO MANUFACTURE SYNGAS AND TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE  DESIGN OF THE FACILITY. IN CONSIDERATION, THE PROJECT TECHNOLOGY LICENSE AGREEMENT CALLS FOR A LICENSE FEE TO BE FINALIZED BASED  ON THE DESIGNED PLANT CAPACITY AND A SEPARATE FEE OF $2.0 MILLION FOR THE DELIVERY OF A PROCESS DESIGN PACKAGE. THE LICENSE AGREEMENT  CALLS FOR LICENSE FEES TO BE PAID AS PROJECT MILESTONES ARE REACHED THROUGHOUT THE PLANNING, CONSTRUCTION AND FIRST FIVE YEARS  OF PLANT OPERATIONS. THE SUCCESS AND TIMING OF THE PROJECT BEING DEVELOPED BY AFE WILL AFFECT IF AND/OR WHEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO  RECEIVE ALL OF THE PAYMENTS RELATED TO THIS TECHNOLOGY LICENSE AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT AFE WILL BE  SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING THIS OR ANY OTHER PROJECT OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DELIVER THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PROJECT.  IN  AUGUST 2017, AFE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF A MINE DEVELOPMENT LEASE RELATED TO THE 266-MILLION TON COAL RESOURCE NEAR PENTLAND,  QUEENSLAND THROUGH AFE\u2019S WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, GREAT NORTHERN ENERGY PTY LTD (\u201cGNE\u201d).  32  IN  JULY 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A LOAN AGREEMENT (THE \u201cLOAN AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH AFE TO PROVIDE SHORT-TERM FUNDING IN ORDER  TO ENABLE AFE TO CONTINUE TO PROGRESS ITS PROJECT RELATED INITIATIVES FOR THE BETTERMENT OF AFE SHAREHOLDERS AND THE SUCCESSFUL  PROMOTION OF THEIR PROJECTS IN THE AMOUNT OF 350,000 AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS, APPROXIMATELY $260,000.

CURRENTLY,  AFE IS FOCUSED ON RAISING THE NECESSARY FUNDS THAT WOULD ALLOW THIS PROJECT TO ADVANCE INTO FRONT-END ENGINEERING DESIGN (FEED)  AND ALLOW AFE TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE OF SYNTHESIS ENERGY SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY, LLC FROM THE COMPANY.  FOR  OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN AFE, WE HAVE BEEN CONTRIBUTING CASH AND ENGINEERING SUPPORT FOR AFE\u2019S BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT WHILE  AMBRE CONTRIBUTED CASH AND SERVICES. ADDITIONAL OWNERSHIP IN AFE HAS BEEN GRANTED TO THE AFE MANAGEMENT TEAM AND STAFF INDIVIDUALS  PROVIDING SERVICES TO AFE. IN AUGUST 2017 AND MARCH 2018, WE ELECTED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF $0.47 MILLION AND $0.16  MILLION RESPECTIVELY TO ASSIST AFE WITH DEVELOPING ITS BUSINESS IN AUSTRALIA.  WE  ACCOUNT FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN AFE UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD. OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY 36% MAKES US THE SECOND LARGEST  SHAREHOLDER. WE ALSO MAINTAIN A SEAT ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHICH ALLOWS US TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE OPERATIONS  AND FINANCIAL DECISIONS, BUT NOT CONTROL, OF THE COMPANY. OUR CARRYING VALUE OF OUR AFE INVESTMENT AS OF BOTH MARCH 31, 2019 AND  JUNE 30, 2018 WAS ZERO.  33  BATCHFIRE  RESOURCES PTY LTD  AS  A RESULT OF AFE\u2019S EARLY STAGE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CALLIDE COAL MINE IN CENTRAL QUEENSLAND,  AUSTRALIA, AFE CREATED BFR. BFR WAS A SPIN-OFF COMPANY FOR WHICH OWNERSHIP INTEREST WAS DISTRIBUTED TO THE EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS  OF AFE AND TO THE NEW BFR MANAGEMENT TEAM IN DECEMBER 2015. BFR IS REGISTERED IN AUSTRALIA AND WAS FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PURCHASING  THE CALLIDE THERMAL COAL MINE FROM ANGLO-AMERICAN PLC (\u201cANGLO-AMERICAN\u201d). THE CALLIDE MINE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST THERMAL  COAL MINES IN AUSTRALIA AND HAS BEEN IN OPERATION FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS.

IN  OCTOBER 2016, BFR STATED THAT IT HAD RECEIVED INVESTMENT SUPPORT FOR THE ACQUISITION FROM SINGAPORE-BASED LINDENFELS PTE, LTD,  A SUBSIDIARY OF COMMODITY TRADERS AVRA COMMODITIES, AND AS A RESULT THE ACQUISITION OF THE CALLIDE THERMAL COAL MINE FROM ANGLO-AMERICAN  WAS COMPLETED IN OCTOBER 2016. SINCE THEN, BFR HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTING ITS PLAN AT CALLIDE INTENDED TO LOWER THE PER UNIT MINING  COSTS AND DELIVER PROFITABLE FINANCIAL RESULTS.  IN  JANUARY 2018, THE MINISTER OF NATURAL RESOURCES, MINES AND ENERGY APPROVED BFR\u2019S MINING LEASE APPLICATION THROUGH TO 2043  FOR CALLIDE COAL MINE\u2019S BOUNDARY HILL SOUTH PROJECT. THE CALLIDE MINING TENURE EXTENDS ACROSS 180 SQUARE KILOMETERS AND  CONTAINS AN ESTIMATED COAL RESOURCE OF UP TO 1.7 BILLION METRIC TONS AND SALEABLE COAL PRODUCTION AVERAGES 10 MILLION METRIC TONS  PER YEAR  WE  ACCOUNT FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN BFR UNDER THE COST METHOD. OUR LIMITED OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN BFR WAS APPROXIMATELY 11% AND WE DO  NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE OPERATION OR FINANCIAL DECISIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY. AT THE TIME OF THE SPIN-OFF, THE  CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR INVESTMENT IN AFE WAS REDUCED TO ZERO THROUGH EQUITY LOSSES. AS SUCH, THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IN BFR  POST SPIN-OFF WAS ALSO ZERO. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN BFR WAS APPROXIMATELY 11% AND THE CARRYING VALUE  OF OUR INVESTMENT IN BFR AS OF BOTH MARCH 31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2018 WAS ZERO.  TOWNSVILLE  METALS INFRASTRUCTURE PTY LTD  IN  AUGUST 2018, AFE FORMED A SEPARATE UNRELATED COMPANY, TOWNSVILLE METALS INFRASTRUCTURE PTY LTD (\u201cTMI\u201d) FOR THE PURPOSE  OF COMPLETING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REQUIRED INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS RAIL AND PORT MODIFICATIONS RELATED TO THE TRANSPORT OF MINED  PRODUCTS INCLUDING COAL FROM THE PENTLAND RESOURCE TO THE TOWNSVILLE PORT.

IN ITS FIRST PHASE  OF OPERATION, 4.5 MILLION MTPA OF COAL IS PLANNED FOR EXPORT TO ASIAN MARKETS WITH THE BALANCE OF 1.5 MILLION MTPA FOR FEEDSTOCK  TO A FUTURE PROPOSED COAL GASIFICATION PROJECT. IT IS ANTICIPATED BY CRR, BASED ON CURRENT PLANNING, FOR THE PROJECT TO BE OPERATIONAL  IN 2022. CRR HAS INDICATED THAT A DRILLING PROGRAM IS PLANNED TO COMMENCE IN LATE 2019 TO EXPAND THE SIZE AND OVERALL QUALITY  AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE PENTLAND RESOURCE.  WE  ACCOUNT FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN CRR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD. OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF APPROXIMATELY 38% MAKES US THE SECOND LARGEST  SHAREHOLDER. WE MAY APPOINT ONE BOARD DIRECTOR FOR EACH 15% OWNERSHIP INTEREST WE HOLD IN CRR WHICH ALLOWS US TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT  INFLUENCE ON THE OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL DECISIONS, BUT NOT CONTROL, OF THE COMPANY. OUR CARRYING VALUE OF OUR CRR INVESTMENT  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 WAS ZERO.  34  SES  ENCOAL ENERGY SP. Z O.O  IN  OCTOBER 2017, WE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH WARSAW-BASED ENINVESTMENTS SP. Z O.O. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENTS, WE AND  ENINVESTMENTS ARE EQUAL SHAREHOLDERS OF SEE AND SEE WILL EXCLUSIVELY MARKET, DEVELOP, AND COMMERCIALIZE PROJECTS IN POLAND WHICH  UTILIZE OUR TECHNOLOGY, SERVICES AND PROPRIETARY EQUIPMENT AND WE SHARE WITH SEE A PORTION OF THE TECHNOLOGY LICENSE PAYMENTS,  NET OF FEES, WE RECEIVE FROM POLAND. THE GOAL OF SEE IS TO ESTABLISH EFFICIENT CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS THAT PROVIDE POLISH INDUSTRIES  SUPERIOR ECONOMIC BENEFITS AS COMPARED TO THE USE OF EXPENSIVE, IMPORTED NATURAL GAS AND LNG, WHILE PROVIDING ENERGY INDEPENDENCE  THROUGH OUR TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITIES TO CONVERT THE WIDE RANGE OF POLAND\u2019S INDIGENOUS COALS, COAL WASTE, BIOMASS AND MUNICIPAL  WASTE TO VALUABLE SYNGAS PRODUCTS. SEE HAS DEVELOPED A PIPELINE OF PROJECTS AND TOGETHER WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH POLISH CUSTOMERS  AND PARTNERS TO COMPLETE THE NECESSARY PROJECT FEASIBILITY, PERMITTING AND SGT TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENT STEPS REQUIRED PRIOR TO STARTING  CONSTRUCTION ON THE PROJECTS.  TAURON  WYTWARZANIE S.A., (\u201cTAURON\u201d), HAS CONTRACTED POLAND\u2019S INSTITUTE OF COAL CHEMISTRY (\u201cICHPW\u201d) TO COMPLETE  A DETAILED PRELIMINARY DESIGN ASSESSMENT AND ECONOMIC STUDY FOR THE CONVERSION OF ITS 200MW CONVENTIONAL POWER BOILERS TO CLEAN  SYNGAS WHICH WOULD BE POLAND\u2019S FIRST SGT FACILITY. THE PROJECT FEASIBILITY STUDY CONCLUDED IN MARCH 2018 WITH POSITIVE RESULTS.  THE RESULTS PRESENTED BY ICHPW TO TAURON HAVE SHOWN THAT THE CONVERSION OF TAURON\u2019S 200 MW POWER BOILER UTILIZING SGT CAN  BE BOTH ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY BENEFICIAL. WE BELIEVE THAT SGT POWER BOILER CONVERSIONS ARE AN IDEAL SOLUTION  CAPABLE OF MEETING EU AND IED TARGETS.  FOR  OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN SEE, WE HAVE BEEN CONTRIBUTING CASH AND ASSISTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEE. SEE WAS FUNDED IN JANUARY  2018 WITH A CASH CONTRIBUTION OF APPROXIMATELY $6,000 AND ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN MARCH 2018 OF APPROXIMATELY $76,000. IN AUGUST  2018, WE MADE AN ADDITIONAL CASH CONTRIBUTION OF APPROXIMATELY $11,000.  WE  ACCOUNT FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN SEE UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD. OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST OF 50% MAKES US AN EQUAL SHAREHOLDER AND WE  ALSO MAINTAIN TWO OF THE FOUR SEATS ON THE MANAGEMENT BOARD WHICH ALLOWS US TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE OPERATIONS AND  FINANCIAL DECISIONS, BUT NOT CONTROL, OF THE COMPANY. OUR CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN SEE AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND JUNE  30, 2018 WAS APPROXIMATELY $23,000 AND $36,000, RESPECTIVELY.  YIMA  JOINT VENTURE  IN  AUGUST 2009, WE ENTERED INTO JOINT VENTURE CONTRACTS AND RELATED AGREEMENTS WITH YIMA COAL INDUSTRY GROUP COMPANY (\u201cYIMA\u201d).  WE CONTINUE TO OWN A 25% INTEREST IN THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE AND YIMA OWNS A 75% INTEREST.  IN  DECEMBER 2017 AND JANUARY 2018, ON-GOING DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE MANAGEMENT RESULTED  IN THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEING TO PAY VARIOUS COSTS INCURRED BY US DURING THE CONSTRUCTION AND COMMISSIONING PERIOD OF THE FACILITY  IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY 16 MILLION CHINESE RENMINBI YUAN, (\u201cRMB\u201d), (APPROXIMATELY $2.3 MILLION). AS OF JUNE  30, 2018, WE HAVE RECEIVED 6.15 MILLION RMB (APPROXIMATELY $0.9 MILLION) OF PAYMENTS FROM THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE RELATED TO THESE  COSTS. ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS MAY BE FORTHCOMING. DUE TO UNCERTAINTY, REVENUES WILL BE RECORDED UPON RECEIPT OF PAYMENT. DISPITE  OUR CONTINUOUS COLLECTION EFFORTS, WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS DURING THE NINE-MONTHS ENDING MARCH 31, 2019.  SINCE  2014, WE HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR THIS JOINT VENTURE UNDER THE COST METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. OUR CONCLUSION TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS JOINT VENTURE  UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY IS BASED UPON OUR HISTORICAL LACK OF SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE IN THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE. THE LACK OF SIGNIFICANT  INFLUENCE WAS DETERMINED BASED UPON OUR INTERACTIONS WITH THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE RELATED TO OUR LIMITED PARTICIPATION IN OPERATING  AND FINANCIAL POLICYMAKING PROCESSES COUPLED WITH OUR LIMITED ABILITY TO INFLUENCE DECISIONS WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE FINANCIAL  SUCCESS OF THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE. WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR LEVEL OF INFLUENCE OVER THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE.  35  WE  EVALUATED THE CONDITIONS OF THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECREASE IN VALUE HAD OCCURRED  AS OF JUNE 30, 2018 AND 2017. AT JUNE 30, 2018, MANAGEMENT DETERMINED THERE WAS A TRIGGERING EVENT RELATED TO THE VALUE OF ITS  INVESTMENT IN THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE. LOWER PRODUCTION LEVELS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER REDUCED THE ANNUAL PRODUCTION BELOW EXPECTATION,  WHICH RESULTED IN A NET INCREASE IN THE WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AND THE DEBT LEVEL OF THE JOINT VENTURE. AT JUNE 30, 2017, MANAGEMENT  DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE TRIGGERING EVENTS RELATED TO THE VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT AND THESE WERE THE LOWER THAN EXPECTED PRODUCTION  LEVELS AND THE INCREASED DEBT LEVELS AS COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR, WHICH INDICATED A CONTINUED CASH FLOW CONCERN FOR THE JOINT  VENTURE. MANAGEMENT DETERMINED THESE EVENTS IN BOTH YEARS WERE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IN NATURE AND THEREFORE CONDUCTED AN IMPAIRMENT  ANALYSIS UTILIZING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW FAIR MARKET VALUATION AND A BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL-FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONALITY USED IN VALUING  COMPANIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF DEBT WHERE A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW VALUATION MAY BE INADEQUATE FOR ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE  WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A THIRD-PARTY VALUATION EXPERT. IN THESE VALUATIONS, SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS WERE USED TO CALCULATE  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT (SEE NOTE 2 \u2013  (E) USE OF ESTIMATES)  . THESE INPUTS INCLUDED FORECASTED METHANOL AND  COAL PRICES, CALCULATED DISCOUNT RATES AND DISCOUNT FOR LACK OF MARKETABILITY AS THE MAJORITY OWNER IS A STATE-OWNED ENTITY IN  CHINA, VOLATILITY ANALYSIS AND INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE JOINT VENTURE. THE VALUATION LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE INVESTMENT  IN THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE WAS IMPAIRED AS OF JUNE 30, 2018, AND ACCORDINGLY, WE RECORDED A $3.5 MILLION IMPAIRMENT FOR THE YEAR  ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE PREVIOUS VALUATION CONCLUDED THERE WAS AN IMPAIRMENT WHICH RESULTED IN US RECORDING A $17.7 MILLION IMPAIRMENT  FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017.  AS  OF MARCH 31, 2019, THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE\u2019S THIRD-PARTY LOANS BALANCE WAS APPROXIMATELY 46.9 MILLION CHINESE RENMINBI YUAN  (\u201cRMB\u201d), APPROXIMATELY $7.0 MILLION, WITH $5.0 MILLION DUE IN APRIL 2019 AND $2.0 MILLION DUE IN APRIL 2020.  MANAGEMENT  DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NOT AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY TRIGGERING EVENT DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE CARRYING VALUE  OF OUR YIMA JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY $5.0 MILLION AS OF BOTH MARCH 31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2018. WE CONTINUE TO  MONITOR THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE AND COULD RECORD AN ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT IN THE FUTURE IF OPERATING CONDITIONS DETERIORATE OR  IF THE CASH FLOW SITUATION WORSENS.  TIANWO-SES  CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED  JOINT  VENTURE CONTRACT  IN  FEBRUARY 2014, SES ASIA TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED, ONE OF OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, ENTERED INTO A JOINT VENTURE CONTRACT (THE  \u201cJV CONTRACT\u201d) WITH ZHANGJIAGANG CHEMICAL MACHINERY CO., LTD., WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY CHANGED ITS LEGAL NAME TO SUZHOU  THVOW TECHNOLOGY CO. LTD. (\u201cSTT\u201d), TO FORM TIANWO-SES CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED (THE \u201cTSEC JOINT VENTURE\u201d).  THE PURPOSE OF THE TSEC JOINT VENTURE IS TO ESTABLISH OUR GASIFICATION TECHNOLOGY AS THE LEADING GASIFICATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE  TSEC JOINT VENTURE TERRITORY (WHICH IS CHINA, INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES, VIETNAM, MONGOLIA AND MALAYSIA) BY BECOMING A LEADING  PROVIDER OF PROPRIETARY EQUIPMENT AND ENGINEERING SERVICES FOR THE TECHNOLOGY. THE SCOPE OF THE TSEC JOINT VENTURE IS TO MARKET  AND LICENSE OUR GASIFICATION TECHNOLOGY VIA PROJECT SUBLICENSES; PROCUREMENT AND SALE OF PROPRIETARY EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES; COAL  TESTING; AND ENGINEERING, PROCUREMENT AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO THE TECHNOLOGY.  IN  AUGUST 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT OF THE TSEC JOINT VENTURE (\u201cRESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT\u201d). THE  AGREED CHANGE IN SHARE OWNERSHIP, REDUCTION IN THE REGISTERED CAPITAL OF THE JOINT VENTURE, AND THE FINAL TRANSFER OF SHARES WITH  LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES WAS COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 2017. IN THIS RESTRUCTURING, AN ADDITIONAL PARTY WAS ADDED TO THE JV CONTRACT,  UPON RECEIPT OF FINAL GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS, THE INNOVATIVE COAL CHEMICAL DESIGN INSTITUTE (\u201cICCDI\u201d) HAS BECOME A  25% OWNER OF TSEC JOINT VENTURE, WE HAVE DECREASED OUR OWNERSHIP TO 25% AND STT HAS DECREASED ITS OWNERSHIP TO 50%. ICCDI PREVIOUSLY  SERVED AS GENERAL CONTRACTOR AND ENGINEERED AND CONSTRUCTED ALL THREE PROJECTS FOR THE ALUMINUM CORPORATION OF CHINA. WE RECEIVED  11.15 MILLION RMB (APPROXIMATELY $1.7 MILLION) FROM ICCDI AS A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE JOINT VENTURE  RESTRUCTURING, WE ALSO RECEIVED 1.2 MILLION RMB (APPROXIMATELY $180,000) RELATED TO OUTSTANDING INVOICES FOR SERVICES WE HAD PROVIDED  TO THE TSEC JOINT VENTURE.  THE  TSEC JOINT VENTURE IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD. OUR INITIAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION IN THE FORMATION OF THE VENTURE  WAS THE TECHNOLOGY USAGE AND CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT (\u201cTUCA\u201d), WHICH IS AN INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS SUCH, WE DID NOT RECORD  A CARRYING VALUE AT THE INCEPTION OF THE VENTURE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THE TSEC JOINT VENTURE AS OF BOTH MARCH  31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2018 WAS ZERO.  36  TUCA  PURSUANT  TO THE TUCA, WE HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE TSEC JOINT VENTURE CERTAIN EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO OUR GASIFICATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE TSEC  JOINT VENTURE TERRITORY, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO: (I) GRANT SITE SPECIFIC PROJECT SUB-LICENSES TO THIRD PARTIES; (II) USE OUR MARKS  FOR PROPRIETARY EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES; (III) ENGINEER AND/OR DESIGN PROCESSES THAT UTILIZE OUR TECHNOLOGY OR OUR OTHER INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY; (IV) PROVIDE ENGINEERING AND DESIGN SERVICES FOR JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS AND (V) TAKE OVER THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROJECTS  IN THE TSEC JOINT VENTURE TERRITORY THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN DEVELOPED BY US AND OUR AFFILIATES. AS A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING  AGREEMENT, ICCDI WAS ADDED AS A PARTY TO THE TUCA, BUT ALL OTHER MATERIAL TERMS REMAINED THE SAME.

OVERVIEW  OUR COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESSES  STARTING WITH A FOCUS ON PC GRAPHICS, NVIDIA INVENTED THE GPU TO SOLVE SOME OF THE MOST COMPLEX PROBLEMS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE. WE HAVE EXTENDED OUR FOCUS IN RECENT YEARS TO THE REVOLUTIONARY FIELD OF AI. FUELED BY THE SUSTAINED DEMAND FOR BETTER 3D GRAPHICS AND THE SCALE OF THE GAMING MARKET, NVIDIA HAS EVOLVED THE GPU INTO A COMPUTER BRAIN AT THE INTERSECTION OF VIRTUAL REALITY, HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING, OR HPC, AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, OR AI.  OUR TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS - GPU AND TEGRA PROCESSOR - ARE BASED ON A SINGLE UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE. FROM OUR PROPRIETARY PROCESSORS, WE HAVE CREATED PLATFORMS THAT ADDRESS FOUR LARGE MARKETS WHERE OUR EXPERTISE IS CRITICAL: GAMING, PROFESSIONAL VISUALIZATION, DATA CENTER, AND AUTOMOTIVE.  OUR GPU PRODUCT BRANDS ARE AIMED AT SPECIALIZED MARKETS INCLUDING GEFORCE FOR GAMERS; QUADRO FOR DESIGNERS; TESLA AND DGX FOR AI DATA SCIENTISTS AND BIG DATA RESEARCHERS; AND GRID FOR CLOUD-BASED VISUAL COMPUTING USERS. OUR TEGRA BRAND INTEGRATES AN ENTIRE COMPUTER ONTO A SINGLE CHIP, AND INCORPORATES GPUS AND MULTI-CORE CPUS TO DRIVE SUPERCOMPUTING FOR AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS, DRONES, AND CARS, AS WELL AS FOR CONSOLES AND MOBILE GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES.  HEADQUARTERED IN SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA, NVIDIA WAS INCORPORATED IN CALIFORNIA IN APRIL 1993 AND REINCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN APRIL 1998.  23  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, FUTURE OBJECTIVES AND CHALLENGES  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR  2020  SUMMARY  THREE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 28, 2019  JANUARY 27, 2019  APRIL 29, 2018  QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER CHANGE  YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE  ($ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)  REVENUE  $2,220  $2,205  $3,207  1%  (31  )%  GROSS MARGIN  58.4%  54.7%  64.5%  370 BPS  (610) BPS  OPERATING EXPENSES  $938  $913  $773  3%  21%  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS  $358  $294  $1,295  22%  (72  )%  NET INCOME  $394  $567  $1,244  (31  )%  (68  )%  NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE  $0.64  $0.92  $1.98  (30  )%  (68  )%  REVENUE FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2020  DECREASED  31%  YEAR OVER YEAR AND INCREASED  1%  SEQUENTIALLY.  GPU BUSINESS REVENUE WAS  $2.02 BILLION  , DOWN 27% FROM A YEAR EARLIER AND UP 2% SEQUENTIALLY. THE YEAR-ON-YEAR DECREASE REFLECTS DECLINES IN GAMING AND DATA CENTER REVENUE, AS WELL AS THE ABSENCE OF $289 MILLION  OF OEM REVENUE FROM CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING PROCESSORS, OR CMP.  TEGRA PROCESSOR BUSINESS REVENUE - WHICH INCLUDES AUTOMOTIVE, SOC MODULES FOR GAMING PLATFORMS, AND EMBEDDED EDGE AI PLATFORMS - WAS  $198 MILLION  , DOWN 55% FROM A YEAR AGO AND DOWN 12% SEQUENTIALLY.

THE YEAR-ON-YEAR INCREASE REFLECTS STRENGTH ACROSS BOTH DESKTOP AND MOBILE WORKSTATION PRODUCTS. THE SEQUENTIAL DECREASE LARGELY REFLECTS A SEASONAL DECLINE.  DATA CENTER REVENUE WAS  $634 MILLION  , DOWN 10% FROM A YEAR AGO AND DOWN 7% SEQUENTIALLY, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A SLOWDOWN IN PURCHASES BY CERTAIN HYPERSCALE AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN INFERENCE SALES. WE BELIEVE THIS SLOWDOWN IN PURCHASES WILL LIKELY PERSIST INTO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020.  AUTOMOTIVE REVENUE OF  $166 MILLION  WAS UP 14% FROM A YEAR EARLIER AND UP 2% SEQUENTIALLY, PRIMARILY REFLECTING GROWTH IN AI COCKPIT MODULES.  OEM AND OTHER REVENUE WAS  $99 MILLION  , DOWN 74% FROM A YEAR AGO AND DOWN 15% SEQUENTIALLY. THE YEAR-ON-YEAR DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF $289 MILLION  FROM CMP SALES.  GROSS MARGIN FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2020  WAS  58.4%  , DOWN 610 BASIS POINTS FROM A YEAR EARLIER AND UP 370 BASIS POINTS SEQUENTIALLY. THE YEAR-ON-YEAR DECREASE REFLECTS LOWER GAMING MARGINS AND MIX SHIFTS ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO. THE SEQUENTIAL INCREASE REFLECTS THE ABSENCE OF APPROXIMATELY $128 MILLION IN CHARGES RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 FOR EXCESS DRAM, BOARDS, AND OTHER COMPONENTS.  OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2020  WERE  $938 MILLION  , UP  21%  FROM A YEAR EARLIER AND UP  3%  SEQUENTIALLY, REFLECTING PRIMARILY EMPLOYEE ADDITIONS AND INCREASES IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND OTHER RELATED COSTS, INCLUDING INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2020  WAS  $358 MILLION  , DOWN  72%  FROM A YEAR EARLIER AND UP  22%  SEQUENTIALLY. NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2020  WERE  $394 MILLION  AND  $0.64  , RESPECTIVELY, BOTH DOWN  68%  FROM A YEAR EARLIER. THE YEAR-ON-YEAR DECREASE REFLECTS LOWER REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN, AND HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES. THE SEQUENTIAL DECREASE REFLECTS U.S. TAX REFORM BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  24  AS PREVIOUSLY COMMUNICATED, WE INTEND TO RETURN $3.00 BILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS BY THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, INCLUDING $700 MILLION IN SHARE REPURCHASES MADE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.

WE INTEND TO RETURN THE REMAINING $2.20 BILLION BY THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, THROUGH A COMBINATION OF SHARE REPURCHASES AND CASH DIVIDENDS.  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE  $7.80 BILLION  AS OF  APRIL 28, 2019  , COMPARED WITH $7.42 BILLION AS OF JANUARY 27, 2019. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO OPERATING INCOME AND CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL.  ON MARCH 10, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, OR THE MERGER AGREEMENT, WITH MELLANOX TECHNOLOGIES LTD, OR MELLANOX, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE WILL ACQUIRE ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES OF MELLANOX FOR  $125  PER SHARE IN CASH, REPRESENTING A TOTAL ENTERPRISE VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY  $6.9 BILLION  AS OF THE DATE OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT. THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE APPROVAL BY MELLANOX SHAREHOLDERS AND VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES. IF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS, WE COULD BE OBLIGATED TO PAY MELLANOX A TERMINATION FEE OF  $350 MILLION.

GROSS MARGIN  OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DECREASED TO  58.4%  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR  2020  FROM  64.5%  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR  2019  . THE DECREASE IN FISCAL YEAR 2020 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER GAMING MARGINS AND MIX SHIFTS ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO.  INVENTORY PROVISIONS TOTALED $43 MILLION AND $33 MILLION FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEARS  2020  AND  2019  , RESPECTIVELY. SALES OF INVENTORY THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN-OFF OR WRITTEN-DOWN TOTALED $12 MILLION AND $4 MILLION FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEARS  2020  AND  2019  , RESPECTIVELY. AS A RESULT, THE OVERALL NET EFFECT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN WAS AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF 1.4% AND 0.9% FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEARS  2020  AND  2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  A DISCUSSION OF OUR GROSS MARGIN RESULTS FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IS AS FOLLOWS.  GPU BUSINESS.  THE GROSS MARGIN OF OUR GPU BUSINESS DECREASED DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2020  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER GAMING GPU MARGINS AND MIX SHIFTS ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO.  TEGRA PROCESSOR BUSINESS.  THE GROSS MARGIN OF OUR TEGRA PROCESSOR BUSINESS DECREASED DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER OF  FISCAL YEAR  2020  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST QUARTER OF  FISCAL YEAR  2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO MIX SHIFTS.

THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF  FISCAL YEAR 2020  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF EARNINGS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES TAX, AND AN INCREASE IN THE IMPACT OF TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND THE U.S. FEDERAL RESEARCH TAX CREDIT.  REFER TO NOTE 6 OF THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

OUR INVESTMENT POLICY REQUIRES THE PURCHASE OF HIGHLY RATED FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, THE DIVERSIFICATION OF INVESTMENT TYPES AND CREDIT EXPOSURES, AND CERTAIN LIMITS ON OUR PORTFOLIO DURATION.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED IN THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2020  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2019  , DUE TO LOWER NET INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL.  CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED IN THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2020  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2019  , DUE TO LOWER PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND HIGHER MATURITIES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED IN THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2020  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2019  , DUE TO LOWER SHARE REPURCHASES AND LOWER TAX PAYMENTS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS.  LIQUIDITY  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND THE CASH GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS. OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES CONSIST OF DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND ITS AGENCIES, HIGHLY RATED CORPORATIONS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, ASSET-BACKED ISSUERS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES BY GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISES, AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. THESE MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE DENOMINATED IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS. REFER TO NOTE 7 OF THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  AS A RESULT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AS OF APRIL 28, 2019 ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT INCURRING ADDITIONAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES.  28  CAPITAL RETURN TO SHAREHOLDERS  AS PREVIOUSLY COMMUNICATED, WE INTEND TO RETURN $3.00 BILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS BY THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, INCLUDING $700 MILLION IN SHARE REPURCHASES MADE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, WE RETURNED $97 MILLION IN QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS. WE INTEND TO RETURN THE REMAINING $2.20 BILLION BY THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, THROUGH A COMBINATION OF SHARE REPURCHASES AND CASH DIVIDENDS. AS OF APRIL 28, 2019, WE WERE AUTHORIZED, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN SPECIFICATIONS, TO REPURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UP TO  $7.24 BILLION  THROUGH DECEMBER 2022.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW  CLEARONE IS A GLOBAL COMPANY THAT DESIGNS, DEVELOPS AND SELLS CONFERENCING, COLLABORATION, AND AV NETWORKING SOLUTIONS FOR VOICE AND VISUAL COMMUNICATIONS. THE PERFORMANCE AND SIMPLICITY OF OUR ADVANCED, COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS OFFER A HIGH LEVEL OF FUNCTIONALITY, RELIABILITY AND SCALABILITY.  WE DERIVE A MAJOR PORTION OF OUR REVENUE FROM AUDIO CONFERENCING PRODUCTS AND MICROPHONES BY PROMOTING OUR PRODUCTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL AUDIO-VISUAL CHANNEL. WE HAVE EXTENDED OUR TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET FROM THE INSTALLED AUDIO CONFERENCING MARKET TO ADJACENT COMPLEMENTARY MARKETS \u2013 MICROPHONES, VIDEO COLLABORATION AND AV NETWORKING. WE HAVE ACHIEVED THIS THROUGH STRATEGIC TECHNOLOGICAL ACQUISITIONS AS WELL AS BY INTERNAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE BEGAN SHIPPING OUR PATENTED BEAMFORMING MICROPHONE ARRAY CEILING TILE (BMA CT) TO OUR PARTNERS.  ALL OF THE INNOVATIONS DEVELOPED FOR THE BMA CT MAKE THE INTEGRATOR\u2019S JOB EASIER AND MORE PROFITABLE. THE BMA CT DRAMATICALLY TRANSFORMS HOW INTEGRATORS CAN APPROACH SYSTEM DESIGN FOR CEILING TILE INSTALLATIONS, ALLOWING FOR MULTI-ARRAY SETUPS THAT CAN UTILIZE A SINGLE, LOW-CHANNEL COUNT DSP MIXER WHILE MAINTAINING CLEARONE\u2019S HIGH LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY. FURTHER SIMPLIFICATION COMES FROM THE ARRAY\u2019S BUILT-IN POWER AMPLIFIER, WHICH ALLOWS EACH ARRAY TO DRIVE TWO 10-WATT, 8-OHM LOUDSPEAKERS. THE BMA CT ALSO FEATURES CLEARONE\u2019S PROPRIETARY ADAPTIVE STEERING TECHNOLOGY (THINK OF IT AS SMART SWITCHING). THIS PROVIDES IMPECCABLE ROOM COVERAGE WHILE ELIMINATING THE NEED TO ADJUST INDIVIDUAL BEAMS. INTEGRATORS CAN DAISY CHAIN CEILING TILES VIA P-LINK (CLEARONE\u2019S PROPRIETARY PERIPHERAL LINK) FOR LARGER CONFERENCE SETUPS \u2013 FOR SIMPLER WIRING AND LONGER DISTANCES COMPARED TO NETWORKED HOME-RUN CONNECTIONS. P-LINK ALSO ALLOWS INTEGRATORS TO DAISY CHAIN ADDITIONAL PERIPHERALS SUCH AS WIRELESS MICS, USB EXPANDERS, AND GPIO EXPANDERS.  THE SYSTEM SUPPORTS ALL OF THIS FUNCTIONALITY WITH ZERO CONSUMPTION OF ANALOG I/O AND SIGNAL PROCESSING IN THE DSP MIXER LEAVING THOSE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR OTHER NEEDS.  WE ALSO INTRODUCED COLLABORATE  \u00ae  SPACE TO OUR GROWING FAMILY OF COLLABORATION SOLUTIONS.  IT\u2019S A SUITE THAT UNIFIES MESSAGING, CALLS AND MEETINGS AND WILL ENERGIZE WORKFLOWS AND INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THE ENTERPRISE. DESIGNED AS A PERSISTENT, USER-FRIENDLY COLLABORATION SUITE, COLLABORATE SPACE CONTAINS MANY POWERFUL UCC CAPABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE SEAMLESS ABILITY TO MAKE CALLS OUTSIDE THE NETWORK.  WITH COLLABORATE SPACE, USERS CAN WORK TOGETHER ONE-ON-ONE, OR IN GROUPS OF HUNDREDS, WITH INTEGRATED FILE SHARING, SEARCHABLE ARCHIVES, AND USER PRESENCE INFORMATION. THEY CAN CONNECT WITH COLLEAGUES AND CONTACTS, VIA AUDIO AND VIDEO, WITH THE MOST INTUITIVE COLLABORATION TOOLS. USERS CAN MEET IMMEDIATELY OR SCHEDULE A MEETING AND ACCESS A FULL SUITE OF COLLABORATION FEATURES, INCLUDING FILE SHARING, WHITEBOARDING, ANNOTATION, CHAT, AND MEETING MINUTES.  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER, WE CONTINUED OUR SERIOUS LITIGATION EFFORTS TO STOP INFRINGEMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC PATENTS. WE ALSO CONTINUE OUR PROGRAMS TO CUT COSTS AND TO SPEED UP PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ENABLE US TO GET BACK TO A GROWTH PATH.  OVERALL REVENUE DECLINED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WHEN COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WITH DECLINES SEEN IN ALL PRODUCT CATEGORIES EXCEPT VIDEO. WE BELIEVE THE ON-GOING INFRINGEMENT OF CLEARONE\u2019S PATENTS IS THE MAJOR CAUSE OF OUR REVENUE DECLINE IN THE AUDIO CONFERENCING AND MICROPHONES CATEGORIES.  OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 43% DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 FROM 56% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018. GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED OVERHEAD ABSORPTION INTO INVENTORY AS WE CONTINUE TO REDUCE OUR NET SPEND ON INVENTORY.  NET LOSS INCREASED FROM $1.8 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 TO $2.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THE INCREASE IN NET LOSS IN 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED GROSS PROFIT AND REDUCED TAX BENEFIT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTION IN OPERATING EXPENSES.  INDUSTRY CONDITIONS  WE OPERATE IN A VERY DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY WHICH IS DOMINATED ON THE ONE HAND BY A FEW PLAYERS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN PRODUCTS LIKE TRADITIONAL VIDEO CONFERENCING APPLIANCES WHILE ON THE OTHER INFLUENCED HEAVILY BY A FRAGMENTED RESELLER MARKET CONSISTING OF NUMEROUS REGIONAL AND LOCAL PLAYERS. THE INDUSTRY IS ALSO CHARACTERIZED BY VENTURE CAPITALIST FUNDED START-UPS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES WILLING TO FUND CUMULATIVE CASH LOSSES IN ORDER TO GAIN MARKET SHARE AND ACHIEVE CERTAIN NON-FINANCIAL GOALS.  ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES AND RISKS  THE AUDIO-VISUAL PRODUCTS MARKET IS CHARACTERIZED BY INTENSE COMPETITION AND RAPIDLY EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY. OUR COMPETITORS VARY WITHIN EACH PRODUCT CATEGORY. OUR INSTALLED PROFESSIONAL AUDIO CONFERENCING PRODUCTS, WHICH IS OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCT CATEGORY, CONTINUE TO BE AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION DESPITE THE REDUCTION IN REVENUES. OUR STRENGTH IN THIS SPACE IS LARGELY DUE TO OUR FULLY INTEGRATED SUITE OF PRODUCTS CONSISTING OF DSP MIXERS, WIDE RANGE OF PROFESSIONAL MICROPHONE PRODUCTS AND VIDEO COLLABORATION PRODUCTS. DESPITE OUR STRONG LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE INSTALLED PROFESSIONAL AUDIO CONFERENCING MARKET, WE FACE CHALLENGES TO REVENUE GROWTH DUE TO THE LIMITED SIZE OF THE MARKET AND PRICING PRESSURES FROM NEW COMPETITORS ATTRACTED TO THE COMMERCIAL MARKET DUE TO HIGHER MARGINS.  REVENUE FROM OUR VIDEO PRODUCTS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH. WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN THIS MARKET FROM WELL-ESTABLISHED MARKET LEADERS AS WELL AS EMERGING PLAYERS RICH WITH MARKETING FUNDS. WE EXPECT OUR STRATEGY OF COMBINING SPONTANIA, OUR CLOUD-BASED VIDEO CONFERENCING PRODUCT, COLLABORATE, OUR APPLIANCE-BASED MEDIA COLLABORATION PRODUCT, OUR HIGH-QUALITY PROFESSIONAL CAMERAS, AND OUR HIGH-END AUDIO CONFERENCING TECHNOLOGY WILL GENERATE HIGH GROWTH IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WE BELIEVE WE ARE ALSO WELL POSITIONED TO CAPITALIZE ON THE CONTINUING MIGRATION AWAY FROM THE TRADITIONAL HARDWARE-BASED VIDEO CONFERENCING SYSTEMS TO SOFTWARE-BASED VIDEO CONFERENCING APPLICATIONS.  WE DERIVE A MAJOR PORTION OF OUR REVENUE (APPROXIMATELY 47% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018) FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE. MOST OF OUR REVENUE FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS BILLED IN U.S. DOLLARS AND IS NOT EXPOSED TO ANY SIGNIFICANT CURRENCY RISK. HOWEVER, WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK IF THE U.S. DOLLAR IS STRONG AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES AS IT WILL MAKE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS LESS COMPETITIVE.  A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOLLOWS BELOW.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH CERTAIN ITEMS FROM OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 (\u201c2019-Q1\u201d) AND 2018 (\u201c2018-Q1\u201d), RESPECTIVELY, TOGETHER WITH THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE WHICH EACH SUCH ITEM REPRESENTS.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  2019-Q1  2018-Q1  PERCENTAGE CHANGE 2019-Q1 VS 2018-Q1  REVENUE  $6,305  $7,289  -13%  COST OF GOODS SOLD  3,601  3,190  -13%  GROSS PROFIT  2,704  4,099  -34%  SALES AND MARKETING  1,953  2,868  -32%  RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT  1,587  2,056  -23%  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  1,555  1,617  -4%  OPERATING LOSS  (2,391  )  (2,442  )  2%  OTHER INCOME, NET  42  24  75%  LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAXES  (2,349  )  (2,418  )  3%  PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES  -  (572  )  -100%  NET LOSS  $(2,349  )  $(1,846  )  -27%  REVENUE  OUR REVENUE DECREASED TO $6.3 MILLION IN 2019 COMPARED TO $7.3 MILLION IN 2018. THE HIGHEST DECLINE WAS SEEN IN AUDIO CONFERENCING CATEGORY WITH 11% DECLINE FOLLOWED BY MICROPHONES WITH 9% DECLINE. REVENUE FROM VIDEO PRODUCTS GREW BY 13% ON THE BACK OF GROWTH IN SALES OF VIDEOCONFERENCING APPLIANCES, CAMERAS AND CLOUD-BASED VIDEOCONFERENCING SERVICES. THE DECLINE IN AUDIO CONFERENCING CATEGORY WAS DUE TO DECLINE IN ALL SUBCATEGORIES INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL INSTALLED AUDIO CONFERENCING, PERSONAL CONFERENCING AND TABLETOP CONFERENCING. THE DECLINE IN MICROPHONES CATEGORY WAS DUE TO DECLINE IN BEAMFORMING MICROPHONES. THE ON-GOING INFRINGEMENT OF CLEARONE\u2019S PATENTS IS THE MAJOR CAUSE OF OUR REVENUE DECLINE IN AUDIO CONFERENCING AND MICROPHONES CATEGORIES.  THE SHARE OF AUDIO CONFERENCING PRODUCTS IN OUR PRODUCT MIX DECLINED MARGINALLY FROM 50% IN 2018-Q1 TO 43% IN 2019-Q1. THE SHARE OF MICROPHONES SLIGHTLY IMPROVED FROM 32% TO 33%. SHARE OF VIDEO PRODUCTS IN THE REVENUE MIX INCREASED FROM 18% TO 24%.  DURING 2019-Q1 REVENUE DECLINED ACROSS ALL MAJOR MARKETS EXCEPT MIDDLE EAST, INDIA AND CENTRAL EUROPE. THE DECLINE WAS MORE PRONOUNCED IN THE CANADA, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN AND NORTHERN EUROPE. ASIA PACIFIC INCLUDING MIDDLE EAST DECREASED BY 9%, EUROPE AND AFRICA DECLINED BY 14% AND AMERICAS DECLINED BY 13%.  WE BELIEVE, ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, THAT WE WILL RETURN TO GROWTH PATH WHEN OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES NAMELY PRODUCT INNOVATION, COST REDUCTION AND DEFENSE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUCCEED.  COSTS OF GOODS SOLD AND GROSS PROFIT  COST OF GOODS SOLD (\u201cCOGS\u201d) INCLUDES EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH FINISHED GOODS PURCHASED FROM OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURERS, THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS (INCLUDING MATERIAL AND DIRECT LABOR), OUR MANUFACTURING AND OPERATIONS ORGANIZATION, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT DEPRECIATION, WARRANTY EXPENSE, FREIGHT EXPENSE, ROYALTY PAYMENTS, AND THE ALLOCATION OF OVERHEAD EXPENSES.  OUR GROSS PROFIT FOR 2019-Q1 WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.7 MILLION OR 43% COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $4.1 MILLION, OR 56%, FOR 2018-Q1. GROSS MARGIN FOR 2019-Q1 DECLINED MAINLY DUE TO REDUCED OVERHEAD ABSORPTION INTO INVENTORY DUE TO CONTINUED DECLINED IN INVENTORY PURCHASING ACTIVITY.  OUR PROFITABILITY IN THE NEAR-TERM CONTINUES TO DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR REVENUES FROM PROFESSIONAL INSTALLED AUDIO CONFERENCING PRODUCTS. WE HOLD LONG-TERM INVENTORY AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SELL OUR LONG-TERM INVENTORY, OUR PROFITABILITY MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS AND PRICE MARK-DOWNS.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OPERATING EXPENSES  OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE SALES AND MARKETING (\u201cS&M\u201d) EXPENSES, RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (\u201cR&D\u201d) EXPENSES AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cG&A\u201d) EXPENSES. TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $5.1 MILLION FOR 2019-Q1 COMPARED TO $6.5 MILLION FOR 2018-Q1. THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF EXPENSES RELATED TO SALES AND MARKETING, RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE, AND OTHER ITEMS.  SALES AND MARKETING  - S&M EXPENSES INCLUDE SELLING, CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND MARKETING EXPENSES SUCH AS EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS, ALLOCATIONS OF OVERHEAD EXPENSES, TRADE SHOWS, AND OTHER ADVERTISING AND SELLING EXPENSES.  S&M EXPENSES FOR 2019-Q1 DECREASED TO $2.0 MILLION FROM $2.9 MILLION FOR 2018-Q1. THE DECREASE WAS MAINLY DUE TO DECREASES IN EMPLOYEE RELATED COSTS, MARKETING EXPENSES RELATED TO TRADESHOWS, INVENTORY COSTS FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES AND COMMISSION PAYMENTS.  RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT  - R&D EXPENSES INCLUDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCT LINE MANAGEMENT, ENGINEERING SERVICES, AND TEST AND APPLICATION EXPENSES, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE RELATED COSTS, OUTSIDE SERVICES, EXPENSED MATERIALS, DEPRECIATION, AND AN ALLOCATION OF OVERHEAD EXPENSES.  R&D EXPENSES WERE APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION FOR 2019-Q1, AS COMPARED TO $2.1 MILLION FOR 2018-Q1. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN EMPLOYEE RELATED COSTS AND ALLOCATIONS OF OVERHEAD EXPENSES.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  - G&A EXPENSES INCLUDE EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS, PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FEES, ALLOCATIONS OF OVERHEAD EXPENSES, LITIGATION COSTS, AND CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS RELATED TO FINANCE AND HUMAN RESOURCES.  G&A EXPENSES REMAINED ALMOST THE SAME AT $1.6 MILLION IN 2019-Q1 AND 2018-Q1.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET, INCLUDES INTEREST INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY CHANGES.  OTHER INCOME MARGINALLY INCREASED IN 2019-Q1 COMPARED TO HIGHER INTEREST INCOME.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  DURING 2019-Q1, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY BENEFIT FROM THE LOSSES INCURRED DUE TO SETTING UP OF FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE. DURING 2018-Q1 WE ACCRUED INCOME TAXES AT THE FORECASTED EFFECTIVE TAX BENEFIT RATE OF 27.0%  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $4.3 MILLION COMPARED TO $11.2 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018. OUR WORKING CAPITAL WAS $22.9 MILLION AND $28.3 MILLION AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION IN 2019-Q1, AN INCREASE OF CASH USED OF APPROXIMATELY $1.0 MILLION FROM $0.3 MILLION OF CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2018-Q1. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CASH OUTFLOWS DUE TO CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $1.2 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN NET LOSS BY $0.5 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASE IN NON-CASH CHARGES OF $0.7 MILLION.  NET CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $5.6 MILLION FOR 2019-Q1 COMPARED TO NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $1.0 MILLION DURING THE 2018-Q1, AN INCREASE IN CASH USED OF $6.6 MILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $6.8 MILLION.  CAPITALIZATION OF PATENT DEFENSE COSTS  . WE CAPITALIZE EXTERNAL LEGAL COSTS INCURRED IN THE DEFENSE OF OUR PATENTS WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT A SIGNIFICANT, DISCERNIBLE INCREASE IN VALUE WILL RESULT FROM THE DEFENSE AND A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THE LEGAL ACTION IS PROBABLE. WHEN WE CAPITALIZE PATENT DEFENSE COSTS WE AMORTIZE THE COSTS OVER THE REMAINING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE PATENT, WHICH IS 15 TO 17 YEARS. DURING 2019-Q1 WE SPENT $1.2 MILLION OF LEGAL COSTS RELATED TO THE DEFENSE OF OUR PATENTS AND CAPITALIZED THE ENTIRE AMOUNT.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $9 THOUSAND DURING 2019-Q1. NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.7 MILLION DURING 2018-Q1, WHICH CONSISTED OF CASH OUTFLOWS OF $0.1 MILLION ON REPURCHASE AND CANCELLATION OF STOCK AND $0.6 MILLION FOR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.  WE ARE CURRENTLY PURSUING ALL AVAILABLE LEGAL REMEDIES TO DEFEND OUR STRATEGIC PATENTS FROM INFRINGEMENT. WE HAVE ALREADY SPENT ABOUT $9.7 MILLION FROM 2016 THROUGH MARCH 31, 2019 TOWARDS THIS LITIGATION AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO SPEND MORE TO CONTINUE OUR LEGAL DEFENSE. WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PRESERVING CASH BY SUSPENDING OUR DIVIDEND PROGRAM, ALLOWING THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO EXPIRE AND IMPLEMENTING COMPANY-WIDE COST REDUCTION MEASURES. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL CASH AS OUR INVENTORY LEVELS ARE BROUGHT DOWN TO HISTORICAL LEVELS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE MEASURES TAKEN BY US WILL YIELD HIGHER REVENUES IN THE FUTURE. WE BELIEVE ALL OF THESE AND EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL WILL PROVIDE THE LIQUIDITY NEEDED TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FINANCE OUR GROWTH PLANS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT OUR STRONG PORTFOLIO OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OUR SOLID BRAND EQUITY IN THE MARKET WILL ENABLE US TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IF AND WHEN NEEDED TO MEET OUR SHORT AND LONG-TERM FINANCING NEEDS.

RESTRICTED NET ASSETS  AS ALL  OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH OUR PRC SUBSIDIARIES AND VIES, OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS IS PRIMARILY DEPENDENT ON RECEIVING  DISTRIBUTIONS OF FUNDS FROM OUR PRC SUBSIDIARIES AND VIES. RELEVANT PRC STATUTORY LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERMIT PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS  BY OUR PRC SUBSIDIARIES AND VIES ONLY OUT OF THEIR RETAINED EARNINGS, IF ANY, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRC ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  AND REGULATIONS AND AFTER IT HAS MET THE PRC REQUIREMENTS FOR APPROPRIATION TO STATUTORY RESERVES. PAID IN CAPITAL OF THE PRC SUBSIDIARIES  AND VIES INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED NET ASSETS ARE ALSO NOT DISTRIBUTABLE FOR DIVIDEND PURPOSES.  IN ACCORDANCE  WITH THE PRC REGULATIONS ON ENTERPRISES WITH FOREIGN INVESTMENT, A WFOE ESTABLISHED IN THE PRC IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE CERTAIN STATUTORY  RESERVES, NAMELY GENERAL RESERVE FUND, THE ENTERPRISE EXPANSION FUND AND STAFF WELFARE AND BONUS FUND WHICH ARE APPROPRIATED FROM  NET PROFIT AS REPORTED IN THE ENTERPRISE\u2019S PRC STATUTORY ACCOUNTS. A WFOE IS REQUIRED TO ALLOCATE AT LEAST 10% OF ITS ANNUAL  AFTER-TAX PROFIT TO THE GENERAL RESERVE UNTIL SUCH RESERVE HAS REACHED 50% OF ITS REGISTERED CAPITAL BASED ON THE ENTERPRISE\u2019S  PRC STATUTORY ACCOUNTS. APPROPRIATIONS TO THE ENTERPRISE EXPANSION FUND AND STAFF WELFARE AND BONUS FUND ARE AT THE DISCRETION  OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE AFOREMENTIONED RESERVES CAN ONLY BE USED FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES AND ARE NOT DISTRIBUTABLE AS CASH  DIVIDENDS. RISE KING WFOE IS SUBJECT TO THE ABOVE MANDATED RESTRICTIONS ON DISTRIBUTABLE PROFITS. ADDITIONALLY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH  THE COMPANY LAW OF THE PRC, A DOMESTIC ENTERPRISE IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A STATUTORY COMMON RESERVE OF AT LEAST 10% OF ITS ANNUAL  AFTER-TAX PROFIT UNTIL SUCH RESERVE HAS REACHED 50% OF ITS REGISTERED CAPITAL BASED ON THE ENTERPRISE\u2019S PRC STATUTORY ACCOUNTS.

AS A RESULT  OF THESE PRC LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OUR PRC SUBSIDIARIES AND VIES ARE RESTRICTED IN THEIR ABILITY TO TRANSFER A PORTION OF THEIR  NET ASSETS TO US. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, NET ASSETS RESTRICTED IN THE AGGREGATE, WHICH INCLUDES PAID-IN CAPITAL  AND STATUTORY RESERVE FUNDS OF OUR PRC SUBSIDIARIES AND VIES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED NET ASSETS WERE BOTH APPROXIMATELY  US$12.0 MILLION.  THE CURRENT  PRC ENTERPRISE INCOME TAX (\u201cEIT\u201d) LAW ALSO IMPOSED A 10% WITHHOLDING INCOME TAX FOR DIVIDENDS DISTRIBUTED BY A FOREIGN  INVESTED ENTERPRISE TO ITS IMMEDIATE HOLDING COMPANY OUTSIDE CHINA, WHICH WERE EXEMPTED UNDER THE PREVIOUS EIT LAW. A LOWER WITHHOLDING  TAX RATE WILL BE APPLIED IF THERE IS A TAX TREATY ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN MAINLAND CHINA AND THE JURISDICTION OF THE FOREIGN HOLDING  COMPANY. HOLDING COMPANIES IN HONG KONG, FOR EXAMPLE, WILL BE SUBJECT TO A 5% RATE, SUBJECT TO APPROVAL FROM THE RELATED PRC TAX  AUTHORITIES.  THE ABILITY  OF OUR PRC SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE DIVIDENDS AND OTHER PAYMENTS TO US MAY ALSO BE RESTRICTED BY CHANGES IN APPLICABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE  AND OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  FOREIGN  CURRENCY EXCHANGE REGULATION IN CHINA IS PRIMARILY GOVERNED BY THE FOLLOWING RULES.  \u2022  FOREIGN EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATION RULES (1996), AS AMENDED IN AUGUST 2008, OR THE EXCHANGE RULES;  \u2022  ADMINISTRATION RULES OF THE SETTLEMENT, SALE AND PAYMENT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE (1996), OR THE ADMINISTRATION  RULES.  CURRENTLY,  UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION RULES, RENMINBI IS FREELY CONVERTIBLE FOR CURRENT ACCOUNT ITEMS, INCLUDING THE DISTRIBUTION OF DIVIDENDS,  INTEREST PAYMENTS, TRADE AND SERVICE RELATED FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS, BUT NOT FOR CAPITAL ACCOUNT ITEMS, SUCH AS DIRECT INVESTMENTS,  LOANS, REPATRIATION OF INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES OUTSIDE OF CHINA, UNLESS THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE STATE ADMINISTRATION  OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE (THE \u201cSAFE\u201d) IS OBTAINED AND PRIOR REGISTRATION WITH THE SAFE IS MADE. FOREIGN-INVESTED ENTERPRISES  LIKE RISE KING WFOE THAT NEED FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF PROFITS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS MAY EFFECT PAYMENT FROM THEIR  FOREIGN EXCHANGE ACCOUNTS OR PURCHASE AND PAY FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AT THE DESIGNATED FOREIGN EXCHANGE BANKS TO THEIR FOREIGN  SHAREHOLDERS BY PRODUCING BOARD RESOLUTIONS FOR SUCH PROFIT DISTRIBUTION. BASED ON THEIR NEEDS, FOREIGN-INVESTED ENTERPRISES ARE  PERMITTED TO OPEN FOREIGN EXCHANGE SETTLEMENT ACCOUNTS FOR CURRENT ACCOUNT RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE ALONG WITH  SPECIALIZED ACCOUNTS FOR CAPITAL ACCOUNT RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE AT CERTAIN DESIGNATED FOREIGN EXCHANGE BANKS.  35  ALTHOUGH  THE CURRENT EXCHANGE RULES ALLOW THE CONVERTIBILITY OF RENMINBI INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FOR CURRENT ACCOUNT ITEMS, CONVERSION OF  RENMINBI INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR CAPITAL ITEMS, SUCH AS FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, LOANS OR SECURITIES, REQUIRES THE APPROVAL  OF SAFE, WHICH IS UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE PEOPLE\u2019S BANK OF CHINA. THESE APPROVALS, HOWEVER, DO NOT GUARANTEE THE AVAILABILITY  OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION. WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ALL REQUIRED CONVERSION APPROVALS FOR OUR OPERATIONS  OR THE CHINESE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES WILL NOT IMPOSE GREATER RESTRICTIONS ON THE CONVERTIBILITY OF RENMINBI IN THE FUTURE. CURRENTLY,  MOST OF OUR RETAINED EARNINGS ARE GENERATED IN RENMINBI. ANY FUTURE RESTRICTIONS ON CURRENCY EXCHANGES MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO  USE RETAINED EARNINGS GENERATED IN RENMINBI TO MAKE DIVIDENDS OR OTHER PAYMENTS IN U.S. DOLLARS OR FUND POSSIBLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES  OUTSIDE CHINA.

THE COMPANY HAS OVER 40 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE ACTING AS A DISTRIBUTOR TO U.S. MILITARY COMMISSARIES AND EXCHANGES. THE COMPANY IS THE EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE SUPPLIER OF PRIVATE BRAND PRODUCTS TO U.S. MILITARY COMMISSARIES AND IS CONTINUING TO PARTNER WI  TH DECA IN THE ROLLOUT OF PRIVATE BRAND PRODUCTS TO MILITARY COMMISSARIES WHICH BEGAN DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017.  AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER, THE COMPANY\u2019S RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATED 159 CORPORATE OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE MIDWEST REGION PRIMARILY UNDER THE BANNERS OF  FAMILY FARE, MARTIN\u2019S SUPER MARKETS, VG\u2019S FOOD AND PHARMACY, D&W FRESH MARKETS, SUN MART  AND  FAMILY FRESH MARKET.  THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS PHARMACY SERVICES IN 99 OF ITS CORPORATE OWNED RETAIL STORES AND OPERATES 37 FUEL CENTERS. THE RETAIL STORES HAVE A \u201cNEIGHBORHOOD MARKET\u201d FOCUS TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM SUPERCENTERS AND LIMITED ASSORTMENT STORES.  ALL FISCAL QUARTERS ARE 12 WEEKS, EXCEPT FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S FIRST QUARTER, WHICH IS 16 WEEKS AND WILL GENERALLY INCLUDE THE EASTER HOLIDAY. THE FOURTH QUARTER INCLUDES THE THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS, AND DEPENDING ON THE FISCAL YEAR END, MAY INCLUDE THE NEW YEAR\u2019S HOLIDAY.  IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE MAY VARY WITH SEASONALITY. MANY STORES ARE DEPENDENT ON TOURISM AND THEREFORE, ARE MOST AFFECTED BY SEASONS AND WEATHER PATTERNS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF SNOWFALL DURING THE WINTER MONTHS AND THE RANGE OF TEMPERATURE DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS.  2019 FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED APRIL 20, 2019, THE COMPANY MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND BETTER POSITIONED ITSELF FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. IN LINE WITH ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE TO ACHIEVE MID-SINGLE DIGIT SALES GROWTH, THE COMPANY REALIZED AN INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED NET SALES OF 6.6% COMPARED WITH THE QUARTER ENDED APRIL 21, 2018. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER WAS DRIVEN BY THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S SUPER MARKETS, INC. (\u201cMARTIN\u2019S\u201d), AS WELL AS SALES GROWTH IN THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION AND MILITARY DISTRIBUTION SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON ITS OTHER TOP OBJECTIVES FOR THE CURRENT YEAR, INCLUDING STRENGTHENING ITS MANAGEMENT TEAM, SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS, GENERATING  IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH ITS PROJECT ONE TEAM INITIATIVE, AND REDUCING ITS DEBT, WORKING CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL LEVERAGE RATIOS, WHICH WILL ALL CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVED GROWTH IN ADJUSTED OPERATING EARNINGS AND ADJUSTED EBITDA.  FIRST QUARTER 2019 OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE.  \u2022  THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT REALIZED SALES GROWTH OF 1.2% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. BEFORE THE IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY SALES TO MARTIN\u2019S, SALES INCREASED 5.2%, DRIVEN LARGELY BY SALES TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON PARTNERING WITH INDEPENDENT RETAILERS TO SUPPORT THEIR OPERATIONS AND ENHANCE THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE.  \u2022  LATE IN THE FIRST QUARTER, THE COMPANY INITIATED A VOLUNTARY PRODUCT RECALL FOR FRESH-CUT MELON PRODUCTS PRODUCED AT THE CAITO FACILITY IN INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA DUE TO POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE RECALL, THE COMPANY TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED PRODUCTION OF THE RECALLED PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON PRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION AND SPECIFICALLY WITHIN ITS FRESH CUT FRUIT AND VEGETABLE OPERATIONS. TESTING WAS PERFORMED WITHIN THE MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT BY THIRD PARTY FOOD SAFETY EXPERTS AS WELL AS THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) AND NO EVIDENCE OF CONTAMINATION WAS DETECTED, A PROCESS WHICH INCLUDED OVER 1,000 TESTS AMONG THE VARIOUS PARTIES. THE COMPANY IS WORKING TO IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL TESTING OF INCOMING PRODUCT TO FURTHER ENHANCE ITS FOOD SAFETY PROTOCOLS.  \u2022  THE MILITARY SEGMENT CONTINUED TO SUPPORT DECA IN THE EXPANSION OF ITS PRIVATE BRAND PROGRAM, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO SALES GROWTH IN THE QUARTER. THE COMPANY ALSO GAINED INCREMENTAL SALES WITH AN EXISTING CUSTOMER WHICH OFFSET THE CHALLENGES OF OPERATING IN A COMMISSARY ENVIRONMENT WHICH CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE  NEGATIVE SALES TRENDS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE DISTRIBUTION CENTER THAT EXPERIENCED OPERATIONAL ISSUES IN LATE 2018 AND INTO THE BEGINNING OF 2019. THE COMPANY HAS MADE KEY LEADERSHIP CHANGES AND IMPLEMENTED ENHANCEMENTS TO ITS PROCESSES AND CONTROLS. BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER, THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER\u2019S PERFORMANCE WAS STABILIZED, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE METRICS AND PROFITABILITY RETURNED TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN ITS EXECUTION OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S NEW RETAIL BRAND POSITIONING. SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER, THE COMPANY UNVEILED THE REMODEL OF 18 STORES IN MICHIGAN. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BEGIN REALIZING THE BENEFIT OF THESE INVESTMENTS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2019. THESE INVESTMENTS SUPPORT THE COMPANY\u2019S OBJECTIVES RELATED TO BRAND REPOSITIONING AND IT EXPECTS THAT THEY WILL HELP IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN FISCAL 2019 COMPARABLE STORE SALES.  18  \u2022  THE COMPANY  CLOSED ON THE ACQUISITION OF  MARTIN\u2019S IN EARLY 2019. MARTIN\u2019S IS A LEADING MIDWEST INDEPENDENT SUPERMARKET CHAIN WHICH OPERATES 21 STORES IN NORTHERN INDIANA AND  SOUTHWESTERN MICHIGAN. THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S HAS CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN SALES AND OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT  AND WILL CONTINUE TO COMPLEMENT THE COMPANY\u2019S EXISTING RETAIL INITIATIVES.  \u2022  THE COMPANY CONTINUED ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH A THIRD-PARTY ADVISORY FIRM ON A COMPANY-WIDE INITIATIVE, PROJECT ONE TEAM, DESIGNED TO TRANSFORM ITS CULTURE AND EMPOWER ASSOCIATES AT ALL LEVELS TO DRIVE SUBSTANTIAL ONGOING, SUSTAINABLE IMPROVEMENTS TO BUSINESS PROCESSES AND RESULTS. THE COMPANY SET AN INITIAL GOAL TO REALIZE AN ANNUAL RUN RATE OF AT LEAST $15 MILLION IN SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT 24 MONTHS FROM THIS INITIATIVE. THE COMPANY IS ON ITS WAY TO EXCEEDING THIS OBJECTIVE BY IDENTIFYING OVER $20 MILLION IN ANNUAL RUN RATE SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH THE COMPANY WILL IMPLEMENT OVER THE  NEXT 24 MONTHS.  THE EFFECT OF IMPLEMENTING THESE OPPORTUNITIES IS NOT CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN 2019.  \u2022  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER, THE COMPANY APPOINTED A NEW CHIEF MERCHANDISING AND MARKETING OFFICER, CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER AND SEVERAL OTHER KEY ADDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE IT AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS. OTHER STRATEGIC ADDITIONS TO THE MANAGEMENT TEAM AT VARIOUS LEVELS ARE IN PROCESS AS PART OF A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED PLAN TO STRENGTHEN THE MANAGEMENT TEAM, SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS.  \u2022  ADJUSTED FOR THE FUNDING OF THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY PAID DOWN OVER $20 MILLION IN DEBT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE COMPANY ALSO REDUCED ITS INVENTORY LEVELS BY OVER 2% FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WITHOUT NEGATIVELY IMPACTING CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS, DESPITE CONTINUED SALES GROWTH. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON DEBT AND WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019, THE COMPANY EXPECTS FOOD DISTRIBUTION TO ACHIEVE LOW- TO MID-SINGLE DIGIT SALES GROWTH DRIVEN BY EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND NEW BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SOME ATTRITION IN THE INDEPENDENT RETAIL BASE. THIS EXPECTATION EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY SALES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE MARTIN\u2019S BUSINESS, ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $150 TO $170 MILLION. IN THE MILITARY SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT NEW BUSINESS WITHIN THE SEGMENT, INCLUDING CONTINUED PRIVATE BRAND GROWTH, WILL LARGELY OFFSET THE NEGATIVE DECA COMPARABLE SALES TREND. WITHIN THE RETAIL SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TOTAL SALES WILL INCREASE DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S AND THE SIGNIFICANT CURRENT YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BRAND POSITIONING, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF STORE RATIONALIZATION PLANS. MARTIN\u2019S IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $475 MILLION TO $500 MILLION IN RETAIL SEGMENT NET SALES. FROM A PROFITABILITY PERSPECTIVE, THE EXPECTED NET SALES INCREASES WILL BE OFFSET BY CHALLENGES PRIMARILY WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN ENVIRONMENT, WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO NAVIGATE HISTORICALLY TIGHT LABOR MARKETS AND A HIGHER COST OF TRANSPORTATION. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS LESS CONTRIBUTION FROM THE FRESH KITCHEN OPERATIONS THAN INITIALLY ANTICIPATED AND HAS ENGAGED OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS TO WORK WITH THE SPARTANNASH TEAM TO GENERATE PROFITABILITY IN THIS BUSINESS. THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF THESE OPERATIONS IN THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT AND IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT AND, AS SUCH, THE IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE KEY TO THE COMPANY\u2019S OBJECTIVES IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

THE INCREASES WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREMENTAL SALES FROM THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION AND ORGANIC GROWTH FROM EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION AND MILITARY SEGMENTS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER ORGANIC SALES IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT.

MILITARY NET SALES INCREASED $7.8 MILLION, OR 1.2%, TO $671.4 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER FROM $663.6 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.

RETAIL NET SALES INCREASED $135.5 MILLION, OR 23.9%, TO $701.8 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER FROM $566.2 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.

FOOD DISTRIBUTION OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED $0.1 MILLION, OR 0.3%, TO $24.6 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER FROM $24.5 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.

INCOME TAXES  \u2013 THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 25.9% AND 27.7% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER AND PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, RESPECTIVELY.

THE ORGANIC SALES GROWTH FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY BUSINESSES BASED IN FRANCE, BELGIUM, AND GERMANY DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN WEBSITE FUNCTIONALITY, GROWTH IN NEW CUSTOMERS, AND KEY ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT. WPS EUROPE EXPERIENCED NEARLY 15% GROWTH IN DIGITAL CHANNEL SALES, WHILE CATALOG SALES REMAINED ESSENTIALLY FLAT DURING THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  ORGANIC SALES IN THE AMERICAS DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 10% FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  AND DECREASED IN THE HIGH-SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  WPS AMERICAS CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM THE DIGITAL PLATFORM IMPLEMENTED IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND REALIZED A DECLINE IN SALES FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS. THE BUSINESS TRANSITIONED TO A NEW DIGITAL PLATFORM TOWARD THE END OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 TO ADDRESS THIS DECLINE. THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE NEW DIGITAL PLATFORM IS IMPROVED COMPARED TO THE FORMER DIGITAL PLATFORM, HOWEVER, SALES HAVE NOT YET RETURNED TO THE LEVEL EXPERIENCED PRIOR TO THE INITIAL PLATFORM CHANGE FROM LAST YEAR. CATALOG CHANNEL SALES DECLINED IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGITS FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS DUE TO LOWER RESPONSE RATES TO CATALOG PROMOTIONS.  ORGANIC SALES IN AUSTRALIA GREW IN THE LOW-SINGLE AND MID-SINGLE DIGITS FOR THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE ORGANIC SALES GROWTH FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD WAS DRIVEN BY BOTH THE DIGITAL SALES AND CATALOG CHANNELS. DIGITAL SALES PRIMARILY DROVE THE GROWTH FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD. THE AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS IS GROWING ITS CUSTOMER BASE, AND ITS DIVERSIFIED PRODUCT OFFERING CONTINUES TO EXPAND INTO ADDITIONAL TARGET MARKETS SUCH AS COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CONSTRUCTION.  SEGMENT PROFIT DECREASED TO  $6.1 MILLION  FROM  $7.5 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , AND TO  $16.3 MILLION  FROM  $21.0 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, SEGMENT PROFIT DECREASED TO  8.0%  FROM  8.7%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , AND TO  7.3%  FROM  8.5%  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASES IN SEGMENT PROFIT WERE DUE TO THE DECREASE IN SALES VOLUMES IN THE NORTH AMERICAN BUSINESS, AS WELL AS THE DIVESTITURE OF A BUSINESS IN THE PRIOR PERIOD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  FINANCIAL CONDITION  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED  $57.0 MILLION  AND DECREASED  $3.0 MILLION  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE AS FOLLOWS.  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  NET CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY (USED IN).  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $96,902  $89,222  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (19,338  )  (14,952  )  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (18,271  )  (77,294  )  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH  (2,288  )  (17  )  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $57,005  $(3,041  )  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $96.9 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $89.2 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CHANGE WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL IN SUPPORT OF GROWTH WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $19.3 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $15.0 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE PURCHASE OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT AND FACILITY UPGRADES.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $18.3 MILLION  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $77.3 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF $51.6 MILLION IN NET CREDIT FACILITY REPAYMENTS AND AN INCREASE OF $10.3 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  ON MAY 13, 2010, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF \u20ac75.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES TO ACCREDITED INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS. THE \u20ac75.0 MILLION OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTED OF \u20ac30.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.71% SERIES 2010-A SENIOR NOTES, WHICH WERE REPAID DURING FISCAL 2017, AND \u20ac45.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 4.24% SERIES 2010-A SENIOR NOTES, DUE MAY 13, 2020, WITH INTEREST PAYABLE ON THE NOTES SEMIANNUALLY. THIS PRIVATE PLACEMENT WAS EXEMPT FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933. THE NOTES HAVE BEEN FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED ON AN UNSECURED BASIS BY THE COMPANY\u2019S DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES.  ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2015, THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO AN UNSECURED $300 MILLION MULTI-CURRENCY REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT WITH A GROUP OF SIX BANKS. AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, THE AVAILABLE AMOUNT UNDER THE REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT MAY BE INCREASED FROM $300 MILLION TO $450 MILLION. AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  , THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING ON THE CREDIT FACILITY, AND THE MAXIMUM OUTSTANDING BALANCE DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , WAS $3.4 MILLION. THE COMPANY ALSO HAD LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT OF $3.3 MILLION AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  , AND THERE WAS $296.7 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE BORROWING, WHICH CAN BE INCREASED TO $446.7 MILLION AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS. THE REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT HAS A FINAL MATURITY DATE OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2020. AS SUCH, THE BORROWING IS INCLUDED IN \"LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS\" ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S DEBT AGREEMENTS REQUIRE IT TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING A RATIO OF DEBT TO THE TRAILING 12 MONTHS EBITDA, AS DEFINED IN THE DEBT AGREEMENTS, OF NOT MORE THAN A 3.25 TO 1.0 RATIO (LEVERAGE RATIO) AND THE TRAILING 12 MONTHS EBITDA TO INTEREST EXPENSE OF NOT LESS THAN A 3.0 TO 1.0 RATIO (INTEREST EXPENSE COVERAGE). AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, WITH THE LEVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED BY THE AGREEMENTS, EQUAL TO 0.3 TO 1.0 AND THE INTEREST EXPENSE COVERAGE RATIO EQUAL TO 69.4 TO 1.0.  THE COMPANY'S CASH BALANCES ARE GENERATED AND HELD IN NUMEROUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AT  APRIL 30, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY 54% OF THE COMPANY'S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE HELD OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY'S GROWTH HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN FUNDED BY A COMBINATION OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND DEBT FINANCING. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND ITS BORROWING CAPACITY ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND ITS ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, SCHEDULED DEBT REPAYMENTS, AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE MATERIAL OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.

PENNEY CORPORATION, INC. (JCP). JCP WAS INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN 1924, AND J. C. PENNEY COMPANY, INC. WAS INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN 2002, WHEN THE HOLDING COMPANY STRUCTURE WAS IMPLEMENTED. THE HOLDING COMPANY HAS NO INDEPENDENT ASSETS OR OPERATIONS AND NO DIRECT SUBSIDIARIES OTHER THAN JCP. THE HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING JCP, ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT AS \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cUS,\u201d \u201cOUR,\u201d \u201cOURSELVES\u201d OR THE \u201cCOMPANY,\u201d UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED.

UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, ALL REFERENCES TO EARNINGS/(LOSS) PER SHARE (EPS) ARE ON A DILUTED BASIS AND ALL REFERENCES TO YEARS RELATE TO FISCAL YEARS RATHER THAN TO CALENDAR YEARS.  CURRENT INITIATIVES  WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW SENIOR LEADERSHIP TEAM, MANAGEMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF REASSESSING STRATEGIES AND EVALUATING THE TRANSFORMATIONAL NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS.  OUR IMMEDIATE ACTIONS  TO REESTABLISH THE FUNDAMENTALS OF RETAIL INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES.  \u2022  REDUCING AND ENHANCING OUR INVENTORY POSITION;  \u2022  STRENGTHENING OUR INTEGRATED OMNICHANNEL STRATEGY;  \u2022  REDESIGNING AND IMPROVING CORE STORE PROCESSES;  \u2022  IMPROVING OUR SHRINK RESULTS; AND  \u2022  REVAMPING OUR MERCHANDISE ASSORTMENTS AND STRATEGIES.  FIRST, WE ARE CONTINUING OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE AND ENHANCE OUR INVENTORY POSITION. FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, INVENTORY WAS REDUCED BY 16% AND WE HAVE INCREASED OUR SELL THROUGH RATES WITHIN ALL OF OUR MERCHANDISE DIVISIONS.  SECOND, WE ARE CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN OUR INTEGRATED OMNICHANNEL STRATEGY TO RETURN TO GROWTH IN OUR DIGITAL CHANNELS, IN A SUSTAINABLE AND PROFITABLE WAY. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE REMOVED OVER 300,000 UNITS OF UNPRODUCTIVE AND UNPROFITABLE VENDOR FULFILLED MERCHANDISE FROM OUR WEBSITE, WITH ALMOST NO IMPACT TO OUR ONLINE SALES PROFITABILITY.  THIRD, WE ARE REDESIGNING AND IMPROVING CORE STORE PROCESSES WHILE IMPLEMENTING ENHANCED TECHNOLOGY TOOLS TO BETTER EQUIP OUR STORE ASSOCIATES TO DELIVER ON OUR CUSTOMERS' EXPECTATIONS. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE LAUNCHED A NEW CHECKOUT PROCESS TO STREAMLINE TASKS AND ENHANCE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, WHICH IS TRANSLATING INTO A QUICKER CHECKOUT TIME FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.   WE ARE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF TESTING IN SELECT STORES A NEW CENTRALIZED PICK-UP AND RETURNS PROCESS WITH PLANS TO EXPAND THE CONCEPT TO APPROXIMATELY 500 STORES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOURTH, WE ARE TAKING IMMEDIATE ACTION TO IMPROVE OUR SHRINK RESULTS.  WE HAVE MADE TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS AND STAFFING ADJUSTMENTS WHICH HAVE SHOWN IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR INVENTORY SHRINK RESULTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  LASTLY, WE WILL CONTINUE TO REVAMP AND RETHINK OUR MERCHANDISE ASSORTMENTS AND STRATEGIES. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE DISCONTINUED SELLING MAJOR APPLIANCES IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND REFOCUS ON OUR LEGACY STRENGTHS IN APPAREL AND SOFT HOME AS WELL AS OTHER PROFITABLE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. WE ARE ALSO LEVERAGING OUR BEST-IN-CLASS GLOBAL SOURCING AND DESIGN ORGANIZATION ACROSS OUR PRODUCT SPECTRUM TO ENHANCE THE STYLE AND QUALITY WE DELIVER, BUT ALSO TO IMPROVE PROFITABILITY WITHIN OUR ASSORTMENT.  FIRST  QUARTER OVERVIEW  \u25aa  TOTAL NET SALES WERE  $2,439 MILLION  WITH A TOTAL NET SALES  DECREASE  OF  5.6%  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  AND A COMPARABLE STORE SALES  DECREASE  OF  5.5%.  \u25aa  CREDIT INCOME AND OTHER WAS  $116 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $87 MILLION  IN LAST YEAR'S  FIRST  QUARTER. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO INCREASED GAIN SHARE RESULTING FROM IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF THE CREDIT PORTFOLIO.  \u25aa  COST OF GOODS SOLD, WHICH EXCLUDES DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES  INCREASED  TO  66.8%  COMPARED TO  66.3%  IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE INCREASE AS A RATE OF SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM THE LIQUIDATION OF MAJOR APPLIANCE AND FURNITURE FLOOR MODEL INVENTORY, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY AN IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH STORE AND ONLINE NON-CLEARANCE SELLING MARGINS.  \u25aa  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A) EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES  INCREASED  TO  35.1%  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  32.0%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.

WE DEFINE FREE CASH FLOW AS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, LESS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  PLUS THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF OPERATING ASSETS.  FREE CASH FLOW IS A RELEVANT INDICATOR OF OUR ABILITY TO REPAY MATURING DEBT, REVISE OUR DIVIDEND POLICY OR FUND OTHER USES OF CAPITAL THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ENHANCE STOCKHOLDER VALUE.  FREE CASH FLOW IS CONSIDERED A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE UNDER THE RULES OF THE SEC.  FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT REMAINING CASH FLOW AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MEASURE DOES NOT DEDUCT PAYMENTS REQUIRED FOR DEBT MATURITIES, PAYMENTS MADE FOR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS OR REQUIRED PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS, IF ANY.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (\"WE\", \"AGILENT\" OR THE \"COMPANY\"), INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN MAY 1999, IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN LIFE SCIENCES, DIAGNOSTICS AND APPLIED CHEMICAL MARKETS, PROVIDING APPLICATION FOCUSED SOLUTIONS THAT INCLUDE INSTRUMENTS, SOFTWARE, SERVICES AND CONSUMABLES FOR THE ENTIRE LABORATORY WORKFLOW.

NET LOSS FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018  WAS IMPACTED BY A DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF  $533 MILLION  RELATED TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX ACT. SEE NOTE 5, \"INCOME TAXES\" FOR MORE DETAILS. IN THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  , CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WAS  $465 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $518 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018  , CASH DIVIDENDS OF  $104 MILLION  AND  $96 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, WERE PAID ON THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK.  ON NOVEMBER 19, 2018 WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD APPROVED A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM (THE \"2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM\") DESIGNED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE DILUTION RESULTING FROM ISSUANCE OF STOCK UNDER THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. THE 2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZES THE PURCHASE OF UP TO  $1.75 BILLION  OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT THE COMPANY'S DISCRETION AND HAS NO FIXED TERMINATION DATE. THE 2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES AND MAY BE SUSPENDED, AMENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY  638,000  SHARES FOR  $50 MILLION  AND  1.766 MILLION  SHARES FOR  $125 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION. DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE RETIRED APPROXIMATELY  629,000  SHARES FOR  $49 MILLION  AND  1.757 MILLION  SHARES FOR  $124 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE REMAINING  9,000  TREASURY SHARES WERE RETIRED ON MAY 1, 2019. AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE HAD REMAINING AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE UP TO  $1.625 BILLION  OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THIS PROGRAM.  ON MAY 28, 2015, WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD APPROVED A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM (THE \"2015 REPURCHASE PROGRAM\"). THE 2015 REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED THE PURCHASE OF UP TO  $1.14 BILLION  OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT THE COMPANY'S DISCRETION THROUGH AND INCLUDING NOVEMBER 1, 2018.  THE 2015 REPURCHASE PROGRAM DID NOT REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES AND COULD HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.  DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018  , WE REPURCHASED  674,000  SHARES FOR  $46 MILLION  AND  1.3 MILLION  SHARES FOR  $93 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION. DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018  , WE RETIRED APPROXIMATELY  711,000  TREASURY SHARES FOR  $49 MILLION  AND  1.3 MILLION  TREASURY SHARES FOR  $93 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. ON NOVEMBER 1, 2018, THE REMAINING AUTHORIZATION OF  $188 MILLION  UNDER THIS REPURCHASE PROGRAM EXPIRED.  LOOKING FORWARD, DESPITE CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS, WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON DIFFERENTIATING PRODUCT SOLUTIONS, IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMERS' EXPERIENCE AND  GROWING OUR EARNINGS. IN ADDITION, WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON A BALANCED CAPITAL ALLOCATION THROUGH OUR DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. WE EXPECT FOREIGN CURRENCY TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT REVENUE FOR THE REST OF 2019 BUT WE ALSO ANTICIPATE THE CONTRIBUTION FROM OUR SEVERAL ACQUISITIONS IN THE PAST YEAR TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE CURRENCY IMPACT.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) IN THE U.S. THE PREPARATION OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP IN THE U.S. REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE THAT AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MATERIALLY AND INVOLVE DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS BY MANAGEMENT. THOSE POLICIES ARE REVENUE RECOGNITION, INVENTORY VALUATION, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, RETIREMENT AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSUMPTIONS, GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. OTHER THAN ACCOUNTING FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION AND INCOME TAXES AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS DESCRIBED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2018  . MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. ALTHOUGH THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST KNOWLEDGE OF CURRENT EVENTS AND ACTIONS THAT MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY IN THE FUTURE, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE ESTIMATES.  AN ACCOUNTING POLICY IS DEEMED TO BE CRITICAL IF IT REQUIRES AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE TO BE MADE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME THE ESTIMATE IS MADE AND IF DIFFERENT ESTIMATES THAT REASONABLY COULD HAVE BEEN USED OR CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR COULD MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  .    ON NOVEMBER 1, 2018, WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARD CODIFICATION TOPIC 606,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (\"ASC 606\").  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS TO SELL PRODUCTS (HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE), SERVICES AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS (MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS) THAT INCLUDE COMBINATIONS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  WE DERIVE REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF ANALYTICAL AND DIAGNOSTICS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS A PROMISE IN A CONTRACT TO TRANSFER A DISTINCT PRODUCT OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER AND IS THE UNIT OF ACCOUNT UNDER ASC 606. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PROMISED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IS TRANSFERRED TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS FULFILLED IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION THAT WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, THE TRANSACTION PRICE. FOR EQUIPMENT, CONSUMABLES, AND MOST SOFTWARE LICENSES SOLD BY US, CONTROL TRANSFERS TO THE CUSTOMER AT A POINT IN TIME. WE USE PRESENT RIGHT TO PAYMENT, LEGAL TITLE, PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE ASSET, AND RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP AS INDICATORS TO DETERMINE THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO THE CUSTOMER. WHERE ACCEPTANCE IS NOT A FORMALITY, THE CUSTOMER MUST HAVE DOCUMENTED THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE. FOR PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE INSTALLATION, IF THE INSTALLATION MEETS THE CRITERIA TO BE CONSIDERED A SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, PRODUCT REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL HAS PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, AND RECOGNITION OF INSTALLATION REVENUE OCCURS ONCE COMPLETED. PRODUCT REVENUE, INCLUDING SALES TO RESELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS IS REDUCED FOR PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTIES, RETURNS, AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED.  REVENUE FROM SERVICES INCLUDES EXTENDED WARRANTY, CUSTOMER AND SOFTWARE SUPPORT INCLUDING: SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE, POST CONTRACT SUPPORT, CONSULTING INCLUDING COMPANION DIAGNOSTICS, AND TRAINING AND EDUCATION. INSTRUMENT SERVICE CONTRACTS AND SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY ANNUAL CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE BILLED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CONTRACT OR MAINTENANCE PERIOD. THESE CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO REVENUE OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD, AS A TIME-BASED MEASURE OF PROGRESS BEST REFLECTS OUR PERFORMANCE IN SATISFYING THIS OBLIGATION. THERE ARE NO DEFERRED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE CONTRACT, AS THE COST OF THE SERVICE IS RECORDED WHEN THE SERVICE IS PERFORMED. SERVICE CALLS ARE RECOGNIZED TO REVENUE AT THE TIME A SERVICE IS PERFORMED.  WE HAVE  SALES FROM STANDALONE SOFTWARE. THESE ARRANGEMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE SOFTWARE LICENSES AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS, BOTH OF WHICH WE HAVE DETERMINED ARE DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. WE DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO ALLOCATE TO THE LICENSE AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACT BASED ON THE RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE OF EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT THE POINT IN TIME WHEN CONTROL HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. THE REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE CONTRACT IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE MAINTENANCE PERIOD, WHICH IS THE CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THE CONTRACT, AS A TIME-BASED MEASURE OF PROGRESS BEST REFLECTS OUR PERFORMANCE IN SATISFYING THIS OBLIGATION. UNSPECIFIED RIGHTS TO SOFTWARE UPGRADES ARE TYPICALLY SOLD AS PART OF THE MAINTENANCE CONTRACT ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS.  OUR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY COMPRISED OF A COMBINATION OF INSTRUMENTS, INSTALLATION OR OTHER START-UP SERVICES, AND/OR SOFTWARE, AND/OR SUPPORT OR SERVICES. HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ELEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY DELIVERED AT THE SAME TIME AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER. SERVICE REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE CONTRACTUAL PERIOD OR AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER. OUR ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY PROVISIONS FOR CANCELLATION, TERMINATION, OR REFUNDS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT RECOGNIZED REVENUE.  FOR CONTRACTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, WE ALLOCATE THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BASED ON RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICES AND RECOGNIZE THE RELATED REVENUE WHEN OR AS CONTROL OF EACH INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS. WE ESTIMATE THE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE BY CALCULATING THE AVERAGE HISTORICAL SELLING PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PER COUNTRY FOR EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICES ARE DETERMINED AT CONTRACT INCEPTION FOR EACH DISTINCT GOOD OR SERVICE IN THE CONTRACT AND THEN WE ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE IN PROPORTION TO THOSE STANDALONE SELLING PRICES BY PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  CERTAIN OF OUR REVENUE RELATE TO LEASE ARRANGEMENTS. STANDALONE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF ASC 606 AND ARE THEREFORE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 840, LEASES. EACH OF THESE CONTRACTS IS EVALUATED AS A LEASE ARRANGEMENT, EITHER AS AN OPERATING LEASE OR A SALES-TYPE CAPITAL LEASE USING THE CURRENT LEASE CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE.  ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES.  WE MUST MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OCCUR IN THE CALCULATION OF TAX CREDITS, BENEFITS AND DEDUCTIONS, AND IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WHICH ARISE FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES, AS WELL AS INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THESE ESTIMATES MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX PROVISION IN A SUBSEQUENT PERIOD. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WE PROVIDE FOR INCOME TAXES BASED UPON AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE GEOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF WORLDWIDE EARNINGS, TAX REGULATIONS GOVERNING EACH REGION, AVAILABILITY OF TAX CREDITS AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES.  WE MONITOR THE CHANGES IN MANY FACTORS AND ADJUST OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE ON A TIMELY BASIS.  IF ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHETHER DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED IN FULL OR IN PART. WHEN IT IS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT ALL OR SOME PORTION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS MAY NOT BE REALIZED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE MUST BE ESTABLISHED AGAINST SUCH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE ON A JURISDICTION-BY-JURISDICTION BASIS WHEN ASSESSING WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE RECOVERABLE. WE CONSIDER EVIDENCE SUCH AS OUR PAST OPERATING RESULTS, THE EXISTENCE OF LOSSES IN RECENT YEARS AND OUR FORECAST OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. AT  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN U.S. AND U.S STATE AND FOREIGN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN THESE JURISDICTIONS UNTIL SUFFICIENT POSITIVE EVIDENCE EXISTS TO SUPPORT ITS REVERSAL.  THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX LAW AND REGULATIONS IN A MULTITUDE OF JURISDICTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES PRESCRIBES THE USE OF A RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT MODEL, THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION HAS MET THOSE THRESHOLDS WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT BY MANAGEMENT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES, FOR ALL U.S. AND OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS, WE RECOGNIZE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED TAX AUDIT ISSUES BASED ON OUR ESTIMATE OF WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL TAXES AND INTEREST WILL BE DUE. THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF TAX UNCERTAINTIES MAY DIFFER FROM WHAT IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPACT ON INCOME TAX EXPENSE. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF INCOME TAX LIABILITIES PROVES TO BE LESS THAN THE ULTIMATE ASSESSMENT, A FURTHER CHARGE TO EXPENSE WOULD BE REQUIRED. IF EVENTS OCCUR AND THE PAYMENT OF THESE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY PROVES TO BE UNNECESSARY, THE REVERSAL OF THE LIABILITIES WOULD RESULT IN TAX BENEFITS BEING RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD WHEN WE DETERMINE THE LIABILITIES ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY. WE INCLUDE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WITHIN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX ACT WAS ENACTED INTO LAW. THE TAX ACT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGES THE EXISTING U.S. TAX LAW AND INCLUDES NUMEROUS PROVISIONS THAT AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. THERE WERE NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES FROM OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K TO THE TRANSITION TAX EXPENSES AMOUNT. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE FURTHER GUIDANCE FROM FEDERAL AND STATE TAX AUTHORITIES ON ITS BUSINESS AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ANY FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS DISCRETE INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE DETERMINED. WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR ANALYSIS AND ELECTED TO TREAT GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAX INCOME (\"GILTI\") AS \u201cCURRENT PERIOD COST\u201d.  SEE NOTE 5, \"INCOME TAXES\" FOR MORE DETAILS.  ADOPTION OF NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE NOTE 2, \u201cNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS,\u201d TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  FOREIGN CURRENCY  OUR REVENUES, COSTS AND EXPENSES, AND MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AS A RESULT OF OUR GLOBAL OPERATING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAS DECREASED REVENUE BY APPROXIMATELY  3  PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  . WHEN MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON REVENUE IT WILL ALSO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR COSTS AND EXPENSES. WE CALCULATE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES MOVEMENTS BY APPLYING THE ACTUAL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE LAST MONTH OF EACH QUARTER OF THE CURRENT YEAR TO BOTH THE APPLICABLE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. WE HEDGE REVENUES, EXPENSES AND BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES THAT ARE NOT DENOMINATED IN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ON A SHORT TERM AND ANTICIPATED BASIS. WE DO EXPERIENCE SOME FLUCTUATIONS WITHIN INDIVIDUAL LINES OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND BALANCE SHEET BECAUSE OUR HEDGING PROGRAM IS NOT DESIGNED TO OFFSET THE CURRENCY MOVEMENTS IN EACH CATEGORY OF REVENUES, EXPENSES, MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO HEDGE CURRENCY MOVEMENTS ON A RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM BASIS (UP TO A ROLLING TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD). THEREFORE, WE ARE EXPOSED TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OVER THE LONGER TERM. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR ALL, OR PORTIONS, OF AN ACQUISITION PRICE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WE MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE THE RISK THAT CURRENCY MOVEMENTS WILL IMPACT THE U.S. DOLLAR COST OF THE TRANSACTION.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS  NET REVENUE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  SIX MONTHS ENDED  YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE  APRIL 30,  APRIL 30,  THREE  SIX  2019  2018  2019  2018  MONTHS  MONTHS  (IN MILLIONS)  NET REVENUE.

SOME OF THE PROMINENT SERVICES IN THE AGILENT CROSSLAB BUSINESS INCLUDE REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE ON MULTI-VENDOR INSTRUMENTS, COMPLIANCE SERVICES AND INSTALLATION SERVICES. SOME OF THE PROMINENT SERVICES IN THE DIAGNOSTICS AND GENOMICS BUSINESS INCLUDE CONSULTING SERVICES RELATED TO THE COMPANION DIAGNOSTICS AND NUCLEIC ACID BUSINESSES.  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  , THE SERVICE REVENUE FROM THE AGILENT CROSSLAB BUSINESS INCREASED 7 PERCENT IN BOTH PERIODS WITH A 4 PERCENTAGE POINT UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACT IN BOTH PERIODS WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS LAST YEAR.   THE GROWTH IN THE SERVICE REVENUE FROM THE AGILENT CROSSLAB BUSINESS FOR BOTH PERIODS WERE DRIVEN BY THE IMPROVING CONNECT SERVICE RATE ON CURRENT INSTALLED INSTRUMENT BASE, AS WELL AS INCREASE IN HIGHER VALUE SERVICE OFFERINGS. FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, THE SERVICE REVENUE FROM THE DIAGNOSTICS AND GENOMICS BUSINESS INCREASED 26 PERCENT AND 22 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS LAST YEAR.

GILTI.  THE TAX ACT SUBJECTS A U.S. CORPORATION TO TAX ON ITS GILTI.  U.S. GAAP ALLOWS COMPANIES TO MAKE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO EITHER (1) TREAT TAXES DUE ON FUTURE GILTI INCLUSIONS IN THE U.S. TAXABLE INCOME AS A CURRENT-PERIOD EXPENSE WHEN INCURRED (\u201cPERIOD COST METHOD\u201d) OR (2) FACTORING SUCH AMOUNTS INTO A COMPANY\u2019S MEASUREMENT OF ITS DEFERRED TAXES (\u201cDEFERRED METHOD\u201d).

IN THE U.S., TAX YEARS REMAIN OPEN BACK TO THE YEAR 2015 FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES AND THE YEAR 2000 FOR SIGNIFICANT STATES. IN OTHER MAJOR JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS, THE TAX YEARS GENERALLY REMAIN OPEN BACK TO THE YEAR 2001. THERE WERE NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES FROM OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K TO THE STATUS OF THE OPEN TAX YEARS IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS DUE TO EITHER THE EXPIRATION OF A STATUTE OF LIMITATION OR A TAX AUDIT SETTLEMENT. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF YEARS AND NUMEROUS MATTERS THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION IN VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS, MANAGEMENT IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE CHANGES TO THE BALANCE OF OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE FURTHER GUIDANCE FROM FEDERAL AND STATE TAX AUTHORITIES ON ITS BUSINESS AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ANY FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS DISCRETE INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE DETERMINED.

THE INCREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF EARNINGS FROM OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES PURSUANT TO THE GILTI PROVISIONS THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE IN FISCAL 2019. THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PROVISIONAL CHARGE OF $202.0 MILLION RELATING TO THE 2017 ACT THAT WAS RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE BECAUSE OF DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS AND A FAVORABLE MIX OF INCOME FROM OUR FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WITH LOWER TAX RATES. TOTAL DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 WERE $23.1 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATING TO SETTLEMENT OF TAX AUDITS, REVISIONS TO THE PROVISIONAL TAX CHARGES RELATING TO THE 2017 ACT, AND EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2018 WAS HIGHER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE BECAUSE OF THE DISCRETE TAX EXPENSE RELATING TO THE 2017 ACT, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A FAVORABLE MIX OF INCOME FROM OUR FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WITH LOWER TAX RATES AND AN EXCESS TAX BENEFIT FROM SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.

THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d) FOR INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS TO FORM 10-Q AND RULE 10-01 OF REGULATION S\u2010X. ACCORDINGLY, THEY DO NOT INCLUDE ALL THE DISCLOSURES REQUIRED FOR COMPLETE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE ALL ADJUSTMENTS (CONSISTING OF ONLY NORMAL RECURRING ADJUSTMENTS) NECESSARY FOR THE FAIR PRESENTATION OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED. THIS FORM 10-Q SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN SPIRE\u2019S, SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S AND SPIRE ALABAMA\u2019S COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND CASH FLOWS OF SPIRE INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY AND ALL ITS SUBSIDIARIES. TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES BETWEEN CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED FROM THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF SPIRE. IN COMPLIANCE WITH GAAP, TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN SPIRE MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA AND THEIR AFFILIATES, AS WELL AS INTERCOMPANY BALANCES ON THEIR BALANCE SHEETS, HAVE NOT BEEN ELIMINATED FROM THEIR SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  NATURE OF OPERATIONS  \u2013 SPIRE HAS TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: GAS UTILITY AND GAS MARKETING. THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT CONSISTS OF THE REGULATED NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AND IS THE CORE BUSINESS SEGMENT OF SPIRE IN TERMS OF REVENUE AND EARNINGS. THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF THE OPERATIONS OF: THE MISSOURI UTILITIES, SERVING ST. LOUIS AND EASTERN MISSOURI (\u201cSPIRE MISSOURI EAST\u201d) AND KANSAS CITY AND WESTERN MISSOURI (\u201cSPIRE MISSOURI WEST\u201d); SPIRE ALABAMA, SERVING CENTRAL AND NORTHERN ALABAMA; AND THE SUBSIDIARIES OF SPIRE ENERGYSOUTH, SERVING SOUTHERN ALABAMA AND SOUTH-CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. THE GAS MARKETING SEGMENT INCLUDES SPIRE\u2019S PRIMARY GAS-RELATED BUSINESS, SPIRE MARKETING INC. (\u201cSPIRE MARKETING\u201d), WHICH PROVIDES NON-REGULATED NATURAL GAS SERVICES. THE ACTIVITIES OF OTHER SUBSIDIARIES ARE REPORTED AS OTHER AND ARE DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 10  , INFORMATION BY OPERATING SEGMENT. SPIRE MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA EACH HAVE A SINGLE REPORTABLE SEGMENT.  NEARLY ALL THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS ARE DERIVED FROM ITS GAS UTILITY SEGMENT. DUE TO THE SEASONAL NATURE OF THE UTILITIES\u2019 BUSINESS AND THE SPIRE MISSOURI RATE DESIGN, EARNINGS ARE TYPICALLY CONCENTRATED DURING THE HEATING SEASON OF NOVEMBER THROUGH APRIL EACH FISCAL YEAR. AS A RESULT, THE INTERIM STATEMENTS OF INCOME FOR SPIRE, SPIRE MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF ANNUAL RESULTS OR REPRESENTATIVE OF SUCCEEDING QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR.  20  DERIVATIVES  \u2013  IN THE COURSE OF  THEIR  BUSINESS,  CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF  SPIRE  ENTER INTO COMMITMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF NATURAL GAS. CERTAIN OF THEIR DERIVATIVE NATURAL GAS CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED A  S NORMAL PURCHASES OR NORMAL SALES AND, AS SUCH, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (  \u201c  FASB  \u201d  ) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (  \u201c  ASC  \u201d  ) TOPIC 815,  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING  . THOSE CONTRACTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS EXECUTORY CONTR  ACTS AND RECORDED ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS. REVENUES AND EXPENSES FROM SUCH CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED USING A GROSS PRESENTATION. CONTRACTS NOT DESIGNATED AS NORMAL PURCHASES OR NORMAL SALES ARE RECORDED AS DERIVATIVES WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN EARN  INGS IN THE PERIODS PRIOR TO PHYSICAL DELIVERY. CERTAIN OF SPIRE MARKETING\u2019S WHOLESALE PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING ACTIVITIES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. UNDER GAAP, REVENUES AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH TRADING ACTIVITIE  S ARE PRESENTED ON A NET BASIS IN GAS MARKETING  O  PERATING  R  EVENUES (OR EXPENSES, IF NEGATIVE) IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THIS NET PRESENTATION HAS NO EFFECT ON OPERATING INCOME OR NET INCOME.  REGULATED OPERATIONS  \u2013  THE UTILITIES ACCOUNT FOR THEIR REGULATED OPERATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB ASC TOPIC 980,  REGULATED OPERATIONS  . THIS TOPIC SETS FORTH THE APPLICATION OF GAAP FOR THOSE COMPANIES WHOSE RATES ARE ESTABLISHED BY OR ARE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY REGULATOR. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF A REGULATED ENTERPRISE REFLECT THE ACTIONS OF REGULATORS, WHERE APPROPRIATE. THESE ACTIONS MAY RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES IN TIME PERIODS THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAN NON-REGULATED ENTERPRISES. WHEN THIS OCCURS, COSTS ARE DEFERRED AS ASSETS IN THE BALANCE SHEET (REGULATORY ASSETS) AND RECORDED AS EXPENSES WHEN THOSE AMOUNTS ARE REFLECTED IN RATES. IN ADDITION, REGULATORS CAN IMPOSE LIABILITIES UPON A REGULATED COMPANY FOR AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND FOR RECOVERY OF COSTS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN THE FUTURE (REGULATORY LIABILITIES). MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CURRENT REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT SUPPORTS THE CONTINUED USE OF THESE REGULATORY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THAT ALL REGULATORY ASSETS AND REGULATORY LIABILITIES ARE RECOVERABLE OR REFUNDABLE THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS.  AS AUTHORIZED BY THE MISSOURI PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (\u201cMOPSC\u201d), THE MISSISSIPPI PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (\u201cMSPSC\u201d) AND THE ALABAMA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (\u201cAPSC\u201d), THE PURCHASED GAS ADJUSTMENT (\u201cPGA\u201d) CLAUSES AND GAS SUPPLY ADJUSTMENT (\u201cGSA\u201d) RIDERS ALLOW THE UTILITIES TO PASS THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS THE COST OF PURCHASED GAS SUPPLIES. REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE PGA CLAUSES AND THE GSA RIDERS ARE BOTH LABELED UNAMORTIZED PURCHASED GAS ADJUSTMENTS HEREIN. SEE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT REGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN  NOTE 4  , REGULATORY MATTERS.  TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES  \u2013  TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN AFFILIATES OF THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED FROM THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SPIRE. SPIRE MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA BORROWED FUNDS FROM THE COMPANY AND INCURRED RELATED INTEREST, AS REFLECTED IN THEIR SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THEY PARTICIPATED IN NORMAL INTERCOMPANY SHARED SERVICES TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES INCLUDED.

THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF ASC 606 IS THAT REVENUE SHOULD BE RECOGNI  ZED TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER  OF CONTROL  OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES.  UNDER THE NEW STANDARD, AN ENTITY MUST IDENTIF  Y THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN A CONTRACT, DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE AND ALLOCATE THE PRICE TO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN THE OBLIGATION IS COMPLETED.  IN ADDITION, ASC 606 REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE NATURE, AMOUNT, T  IMING AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE ADOPTION OF ASC 606 DID NOT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO HOW SPIRE, SPIRE MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA RECOGNIZE REVENUE, AND THEREFORE, NO CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUS  TMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS WAS REQUIRED, AND THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO FINANCIAL RESULTS AFTER ADOPTION. THE ADOPTION DID RESULT IN CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURES A  BOUT  REVENUE  , WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN  NOTE 2  , REVENUE  . SOME REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS ALTERNATIVE REVENUE PROGRAMS AND  CERTAIN  DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF ASC 606 AND, THEREFORE, ARE PRESENTED SEPARATELY IN DISCLOSURES.  ALSO EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2018, SPIRE, SPIRE MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA ADOPTED  ASU NO.  2017-07,  COMPENSATION \u2013 RETIREMENT BENEFITS  .  IMPROVING THE PRESENTATION OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COST AND NET PERIODIC  POSTRETIREMENT  BENEFIT COST  , WITH NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON INTERIM OR ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE AMENDED GUIDANCE  REQUIRES  THAT THE  SERVICE COST COMPONENT  OF NET PERIODIC PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS  BE  PRESENTED WITHIN  THE SAME  LINE ITEM IN THE INCOME STATEMENT AS OTHER COMPENSATION COSTS (EXCEPT FOR THE AMOUNT BEING CAPITALIZED), WHILE OTHER COMPONENTS  ARE TO BE  PRESENTED OUTSIDE THE SUBTOTAL OF OPERATING INCOME AND  ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR CAPITALIZATION (E.G., AS PART OF UTILITY PLANT)  . THE AMENDED GUIDANCE IS APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY FOR INCOME STATEMENT PRESENTATION AND PROSPECTIVELY FOR CAPITALIZATION. THE COMPANY, SPIRE  MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA ELECTED THE  PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT PERMITTING THE USE OF THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN ITS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN NOTE FOR THE PRIOR COMPARATIVE PERIODS AS THE ESTIMATION BASIS FOR APPLYING THE RETROSPECTIVE PRESENTATION REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, THE COMPANY, SPIRE MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA RECLASSIFIED NET BENEFIT (INCOME) COSTS OF $8.3, $9.5 AND $(1.1), RESPECTIVELY, FROM \u201cOPERATION AND MAINTENANCE\u201d TO \u201cOTHER INCOME, NET\u201d OR \u201cOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET.\u201d THE CORRESPONDING AMOUNTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WERE $7.2, $9.7 AND $(2.1), RESPECTIVELY. THE CORRESPONDING ANNUAL AMOUNTS TO BE RECLASSIFIED FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, 2017 AND 2016 ARE $14.4, $19.2 AND $9.6 FOR THE COMPANY, RESPECTIVELY, $17.2, $17.2 AND $11.2 FOR SPIRE MISSOURI, RESPECTIVELY, AND $(2.0), $2.2 AND $(1.6) FOR SPIRE ALABAMA, RESPECTIVELY. FOR SPIRE MISSOURI, SPIRE ALABAMA, AND THE COMPANY\u2019S OTHER RATE-REGULATED ENTITIES, ALL COMPONENTS OF NET BENEFIT COST HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN RECOVERED FROM CUSTOMERS AS A COMPONENT OF UTILITY PLANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE RECOVERED IN THE SAME MANNER OVER THE DEPRECIABLE LIVES OF THE RELATED PLANT ASSETS; THEREFORE, FOR THOSE ENTITIES, THE COMPONENTS THAT ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE TO BE CAPITALIZED AS A COMPONENT OF PLANT UNDER GAAP WILL BE REPORTED AS REGULATORY ASSETS.  EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY, SPIRE MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA ADOPTED  ASU NO.  2018-15,  INTANGIBLES \u2013 GOODWILL AND OTHER \u2013 INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE: CUSTOMER\u2019S ACCOUNTING FOR IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED IN A CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT  . PREVIOUS GAAP DID NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE ACCOUNTING FOR IMPLEMENTATION COSTS OF A HOSTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE CLARIFY THAT ACCOUNTING AND ALIGN THE ACCOUNTING FOR IMPLEMENTATION COSTS FOR HOSTING ARRANGEMENTS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY CONVEY A LICENSE TO THE HOSTED SOFTWARE. AS A RESULT, CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF IMPLEMENTATION COSTS THAT PREVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE BEEN CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED ARE NOW CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE ARRANGEMENT. THE NEW GUIDANCE IS BEING APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED AFTER ADOPTION. RELATED AMOUNTS CAPITALIZED WERE NOT MATERIAL.  22  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-02,  LEASES  . THE NEW STANDARD REQUIRES LESSEES TO RECOGNIZE A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND LEASE LIABI  LITY FOR ALMOST ALL LEASE CONTRACTS BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS. THERE IS AN EXEMPTION FOR SHORT-TERM LEASES. THE ASU PROVIDES NEW GUIDELINES FOR IDENTIFYING AND CLASSIFYING A LEASE, AND CLASSIFICATION AFFECTS THE PATTERN AND INCOME STATEM  ENT LINE ITEM FOR THE RELATED EXPENSE. ASU NOS. 2018-01, 2018-10, 2018-11  ,  2018-20  AND 2019-01  SUBSEQUENTLY  AMENDED SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE NEW LEASE GUIDANCE, INCLUDING PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT, AN ADDITIONAL TRANSITION METHOD, AND CLARIFICATION OF THE RELATED TRANSITION AND ACCOUNTING FOR LAND EASEMENTS. THE UPDATES  (  C  OLLECTIVELY, \u201cASC 842\u201d)  ,  MAY BE APPLIED USING A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE TRANSITION  METHOD  FOR LEASES EXISTING AT, OR ENTERED INTO AFTER, THE BEGINNING OF (1) THE EARLIEST COMPARATIVE PERIOD PRESENTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR (2) THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION.  ASC 842 IS  EFFECTIVE  FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. THE COMPANY, SPIRE MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA ARE CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACTS OF ADOPTING  ASC 842  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  THEY EXPECT  TO ELECT ALL AVAILABLE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS AND APPLY THE SECOND TRANSITION METHOD.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-13,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \u2013 CREDIT LOSSES: MEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  , WHICH WAS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY ASU NO. 2018-19 IN NOVEMBER 2018. THE STANDARD INTRODUCES NEW GUIDANCE FOR THE ACCOUNTING FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON INSTRUMENTS WITHIN ITS SCOPE, INCLUDING TRADE RECEIVABLES. IT IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, AND MAY BE ADOPTED A YEAR EARLIER. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE INITIALLY APPLIED THROUGH A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION. THE COMPANY, SPIRE MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA ARE CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE TIMING AND IMPACTS OF ADOPTING THIS STANDARD, WHICH MUST BE ADOPTED BY THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021.  IN AUGUST 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2017-12,  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING: TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS TO ACCOUNTING FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES  . THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU MORE CLOSELY ALIGN THE RESULTS OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING WITH RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES THROUGH CHANGES TO BOTH THE DESIGNATION AND MEASUREMENT GUIDANCE FOR QUALIFYING HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS AND THE PRESENTATION OF HEDGE RESULTS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THEY ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, AND EARLY APPLICATION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY, SPIRE MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA ARE CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE EFFECTS OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE, AS WELL AS THE TIMING OF ADOPTION.  2.

THE SALE OF NATURAL GAS IS GOVERNED BY THE VARIOUS STATE UTILITY COMMISSIONS, WHICH SET RATES, CHARGES, AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE, COLLECTIVELY INCLUDED IN A \u201cTARIFF.\u201d THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, WHICH RELATES TO THE PROMISE TO PROVIDE NATURAL GAS, IS SATISFIED OVER TIME AS THE CUSTOMER SIMULTANEOUSLY RECEIVES AND CONSUMES THE NATURAL GAS, AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED ACCORDINGLY.  THE UTILITIES\u2019 TRANSPORTATION REVENUE RELATES TO THE PROMISE TO TRANSPORT THE SPECIFIED QUANTITIES OF NATURAL GAS AT TARIFF RATES. THIS PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED OVER TIME AS THE GAS IS TRANSPORTED, AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS INVOICED MONTHLY.  THE UTILITIES HAVE ALTERNATIVE REVENUE PROGRAMS (\u201cARPS\u201d), WHICH REPRESENT AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UTILITY AND ITS REGULATOR, CURRENTLY CONSISTING OF DECOUPLING MECHANISMS (ALSO KNOWN AS WEATHER NORMALIZATION ADJUSTMENTS) AND INCENTIVE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY ALABAMA\u2019S COST CONTROL MEASURE). WHEN THE CRITERIA TO RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL (OR REDUCED) REVENUE FROM ARPS HAVE BEEN MET, THE UTILITIES ESTABLISH A REGULATORY ASSET (OR LIABILITY). WHEN AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED FOR ARPS ARE BILLED, THE UTILITIES REDUCE THE REGULATORY ASSET (OR LIABILITY) AND INCREASE (OR DECREASE) ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. BILLED AMOUNTS, WHICH ARE PART OF THE OVERALL TARIFF PAID BY CUSTOMERS, ARE INCLUDED IN REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS, WHILE THE CHANGE IN THE RELATED REGULATORY ASSET OR LIABILITY IS PRESENTED AS REVENUE FROM ARPS. DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE BEGINNING ACCRUED ARP BALANCE WAS A REGULATORY ASSET OR LIABILITY AND DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT PERIOD ACCRUAL, THE AMOUNT PRESENTED AS REVENUE FROM ARPS COULD BE NEGATIVE.  THE UTILITIES READ METERS AND BILL CUSTOMERS ON MONTHLY CYCLES. THE MISSOURI UTILITIES, SPIRE GULF AND SPIRE MISSISSIPPI RECORD THEIR GAS UTILITY REVENUES FROM GAS SALES AND TRANSPORTATION SERVICES ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS THAT INCLUDES ESTIMATED AMOUNTS FOR GAS DELIVERED BUT NOT YET BILLED. THE ACCRUALS FOR UNBILLED REVENUES ARE REVERSED IN THE SUBSEQUENT ACCOUNTING PERIOD WHEN METERS ARE ACTUALLY READ AND CUSTOMERS ARE BILLED. SPIRE ALABAMA RECORDS NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION REVENUES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TARIFF ESTABLISHED BY THE APSC. UNBILLED REVENUE IS ACCRUED IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE RELATED GAS COST, AS PROFIT MARGIN IS NOT CONSIDERED EARNED UNTIL BILLED. SPIRE\u2019S OTHER SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING SPIRE MARKETING, RECORD REVENUES WHEN EARNED, AS THE PRODUCT IS DELIVERED OR AS SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.  GAS MARKETING\u2019S CONTRACTS ARE DERIVATIVES. THE WHOLESALE CONTRACTS (WITH PRODUCERS, MUNICIPALITIES, AND UTILITY COMPANIES) ARE SUBJECT TO DERIVATIVE ACCOUNTING. THE RETAIL CONTRACTS (WITH LARGE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS) ARE DESIGNATED AS \u201cNORMAL PURCHASE, NORMAL SALE\u201d ARRANGEMENTS AND ARE THEREFORE ACCOUNTED FOR AS REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED OVER TIME BY THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL OF NATURAL GAS TO THE CUSTOMER, AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS INVOICED MONTHLY.  24  PAYMENTS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED WITHIN 30 DAY  S OF BILLING, AND CONTRACTS GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENT. SPIRE\u2019S REVENUES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RETURNS, REFUNDS, OR WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS.  SPIRE, SPIRE MISSOURI, AND SPIRE ALABAMA HAVE ELECTED TO APPLY A \u201cRIGHT TO INVOICE\u201d PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT, RECOGNIZING REVENUE FOR VOLUMES DELIVERED FOR WHICH THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO INVOICE, AS LONG AS THAT AMOUNT CORRESPONDS WITH THE VALUE TO THE CUSTOMER. DISCLOSURES ABOUT REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT REQUIRED BECAUSE EITHER CONTRACTS HAVE AN ORIGINAL EXPECTED DURATION OF ONE YEAR OR LESS, OR REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED UNDER THE RIGHT TO INVOICE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT, OR BOTH.  SALES TAXES IMPOSED ON APPLICABLE SPIRE ALABAMA AND SPIRE MISSOURI SALES ARE BILLED TO CUSTOMERS. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT RECORDED IN THE STATEMENTS OF INCOME BUT ARE RECORDED AS TAX COLLECTIONS PAYABLE AND INCLUDED IN THE \u201cOTHER\u201d LINE OF THE CURRENT LIABILITIES SECTION OF THE BALANCE SHEETS.  GROSS RECEIPTS TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S NATURAL GAS UTILITY SERVICES ARE IMPOSED ON THE COMPANY, SPIRE MISSOURI, AND SPIRE ALABAMA AND BILLED TO ITS CUSTOMERS. THE REVENUE AND EXPENSE AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED GROSS IN THE \u201cOPERATING REVENUES\u201d AND \u201cTAXES, OTHER THAN INCOME TAXES\u201d LINES, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

THE RECOVERY PERIOD FOR THE FUTURE INCOME TAXES DUE FROM CUSTOMERS AND PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS COULD BE 20 YEARS OR LONGER, BASED ON CURRENT INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (\u201cIRS\u201d) GUIDELINES AND AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE LIFE OF ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS, RESPECTIVELY. THE OTHER ITEMS NOT EARNING A RETURN ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OVER A PERIOD NOT TO EXCEED 15 YEARS, CONSISTENT WITH PRECEDENT SET BY THE MOPSC. SPIRE ALABAMA DOES NOT HAVE ANY REGULATORY ASSETS THAT ARE NOT EARNING A RETURN.  ON MARCH 7, 2018, THE MOPSC ISSUED ITS ORDER IN TWO GENERAL RATE CASES, APPROVING NEW TARIFFS THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE ON APRIL 19, 2018. ON APRIL 25, 2018, SPIRE MISSOURI FILED AN APPEAL OF THE MOPSC\u2019S ORDER RELATED TO THE DISALLOWANCE OF CERTAIN PENSION COSTS INCURRED PRIOR TO 1997 ($28.8), REAL ESTATE SOLD IN 2014 ($1.8), AND RATE CASE EXPENSES ($0.9) TO MISSOURI\u2019S SOUTHERN DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS. ON MARCH 15, 2019, THE APPEAL WAS DENIED BY THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT, AND SPIRE MISSOURI HAS REQUESTED REVIEW BY THE MISSOURI SUPREME COURT.  IN SEPTEMBER 2016 AND FEBRUARY 2017, SPIRE MISSOURI FILED INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM REPLACEMENT SURCHARGE (\u201cISRS\u201d) CASES FOR BOTH SPIRE MISSOURI EAST AND SPIRE MISSOURI WEST (THE \u201c2016/2017 ISRS CASES\u201d). THE MISSOURI OFFICE OF THE PUBLIC COUNSEL (\u201cOPC\u201d) APPEALED THE MOPSC\u2019S DECISIONS APPROVING THESE CASES TO MISSOURI\u2019S WESTERN DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS, ARGUING THAT THEY CONTAINED ISRS-INELIGIBLE COSTS. IN NOVEMBER 2017, THE APPELLATE COURT REVERSED THE MOPSC\u2019S DECISION IN THE 2016/2017 ISRS CASES AND REMANDED THE CASE BACK TO THE MOPSC. IN JUNE 2018, SPIRE MISSOURI FILED TO ESTABLISH NEW ISRS RATES IN BOTH ITS EAST AND WEST DIVISIONS (THE \u201c2018 ISRS CASES\u201d). IN SEPTEMBER 2018, THE MOPSC ISSUED A REPORT AND ORDER FINDING THAT SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S ISRS PETITIONS IN THE 2016/2017 ISRS CASES CONTAINED ISRS COSTS RELATED TO THE REPLACEMENT OF PLASTIC PIPE COMPONENTS THAT SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE REQUESTED REVENUE REQUIREMENT; HOWEVER, THE MOPSC ORDERED THAT NO ADJUSTMENT TO SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S REVENUES WAS NECESSARY AS THE ISRS REVENUES APPROVED IN THESE CASES HAD BEEN REBASED AS PART OF ITS LAST GENERAL RATE CASES. ALSO IN SEPTEMBER 2018, THE MOPSC ISSUED A REPORT AND ORDER IN THE 2018 ISRS CASES STATING ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE WAS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT ALL INVESTMENTS INCLUDED IN THE SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S APPLICATIONS IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE RECOVERY OF COSTS RELATED TO THE REPLACEMENT OF PLASTIC PIPE COMPONENTS AND APPROVED RATES IN THE 2018 ISRS CASES PROVIDING ANNUAL REVENUES OF $2.6 FOR SPIRE MISSOURI EAST AND $5.4 FOR SPIRE MISSOURI WEST. SPIRE IS APPEALING THE REMOVAL OF COSTS RELATED TO PLASTIC IN ALL CASES IN THE WESTERN DISTRICT COURT. ON JANUARY 14, 2019, SPIRE MISSOURI REFILED REQUESTS WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR APPROXIMATELY $3.2 OF THE ISRS REVENUES THAT WERE REMOVED BY THE MOPSC IN THE 2018 ISRS CASES AND FILED NEW ISRS APPLICATIONS FOR BOTH ITS EAST AND WEST SERVICE TERRITORIES. AFTER UPDATING THE PRO-FORMA MONTHS OF DECEMBER 2018 AND JANUARY 2019, SPIRE MISSOURI IS REQUESTING APPROVAL OF ISRS REVENUES OF $7.4 FOR SPIRE MISSOURI EAST AND $7.4 FOR SPIRE MISSOURI WEST RELATED TO INVESTMENTS MADE FROM JULY 1, 2018, THROUGH JANUARY 31, 2019. EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS WERE HELD IN THE 2019 CASES IN APRIL 2019, AND SPIRE MISSOURI EXPECTS AN ORDER FROM THE MOPSC PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE. PER MISSOURI STATUTE, NEW RATES MUST BECOME EFFECTIVE WITHIN 120 DAYS OF THE APPLICATION, OR BY MAY 14, 2019.  28  AS PART OF THE ANNUAL UPDATE FOR  RATE STABILIZATION AND EQUALIZATION (\u201c  RSE  \u201d)  , ON NOVEMBER 30, 2018, SPIRE ALABAMA FILED AN INCREASE FOR RATE YEAR 2019 OF $8.7, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2018.  THERE WAS NO  RSE REDUCTION FOR THE JANUARY 31, 2019 QUARTERLY POINT OF TEST  . AT MARCH 31, 2019, AN ESTIMATED RSE REDUCTION FOR THE APRIL 30, 2019 QUARTERLY POINT OF TEST  OF $3.3  WAS  RECORDED  TO BRING THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON AVERAGE COMMON EQUITY AT  THE END OF THE YEAR TO WITHIN THE ALLOWED RATE OF RETURN.  ON JANUARY 25, 2019, THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION (\u201cFERC\u201d) APPROVED THE COMPANY\u2019S APPLICATION TO COMBINE ITS TWO ADJACENT NATURAL GAS STORAGE FACILITIES IN WYOMING INTO ONE FERC CERTIFICATE WITH A MARKET-BASED TARIFF. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2019, SPIRE STORAGE FILED A PRIOR NOTICE REQUEST PURSUANT TO THE FERC\u2019S REGULATIONS AND SPIRE STORAGE\u2019S BLANKET CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY PROPOSING TO CONSTRUCT AND OPERATE 10.1 MILES OF DUAL 20-INCH-DIAMETER PIPELINE, ONE NEW PIPELINE INTERCONNECTION WITH MEASUREMENT EQUIPMENT, AND RELATED FACILITIES IN UINTA COUNTY, WYOMING. IF AUTHORIZED BY THE FERC, THE PIPELINE, INTERCONNECTION AND MEASUREMENT FACILITIES, WILL ALLOW SPIRE STORAGE TO ENHANCE THE LINK BETWEEN ITS TWO STORAGE FACILITIES, PROVIDE NEW, BI-DIRECTIONAL ACCESS TO KERN RIVER GAS TRANSMISSION COMPANY\u2019S MAINLINE AND AFFORD ENHANCED ACCESS WITH OTHER INTERSTATE PIPELINES. ON APRIL 26, 2019, FERC STAFF FILED A PROTEST STATING THAT SPIRE STORAGE DID NOT PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION OF THE PROJECT\u2019S COMPLIANCE WITH THE NATIONAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION ACT. UNDER THE FERC\u2019S REGULATIONS, A PROTESTED PRIOR NOTICE FILING WILL BE TREATED LIKE A TRADITIONAL APPLICATION UNDER SECTION 7 OF THE NATURAL GAS ACT UNLESS THE PROTEST IS WITHDRAWN WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE UPON WHICH PROTESTS ARE DUE.  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE JANUARY 2017 PRECEDENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN SPIRE STL PIPELINE AND SPIRE MISSOURI, IF SPIRE STL PIPELINE FILES WITH FERC TO INCREASE ITS INITIAL RECOURSE RATE AT ANY TIME BEFORE THE PIPELINE\u2019S IN-SERVICE DATE, AND IF FERC APPROVES SUCH REQUEST IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THEN SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S NEGOTIATED RATE WILL AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE BY THE SAME PERCENTAGE INCREASE TO THE INITIAL RECOURSE RATE, UP TO A MAXIMUM INCREASE OF TWO CENTS PER DEKATHERM PER DAY.  5  .

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK  OTHER THAN IN SPIRE MARKETING, SPIRE HAS NO SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK.  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF SPIRE MARKETING\u2019S TRANSACTIONS ARE WITH (OR ARE ASSOCIATED WITH) ENERGY PRODUCERS, UTILITY COMPANIES, AND PIPELINES. THE CONCENTRATION OF TRANSACTIONS WITH THESE COUNTERPARTIES HAS THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S OVERALL EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK, EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY, IN THAT EACH OF THESE THREE GROUPS MAY BE AFFECTED SIMILARLY BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC, INDUSTRY, OR OTHER CONDITIONS. TO MANAGE THIS RISK, AS WELL AS CREDIT RISK FROM SIGNIFICANT COUNTERPARTIES IN THESE AND OTHER INDUSTRIES, SPIRE MARKETING HAS ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES TO DETERMINE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF ITS COUNTERPARTIES. THESE PROCEDURES INCLUDE OBTAINING CREDIT RATINGS AND CREDIT REPORTS, ANALYZING COUNTERPARTY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO ASSESS FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND CONSIDERING THE INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE COUNTERPARTY OPERATES. THIS INFORMATION IS MONITORED ON AN ONGOING BASIS. IN SOME INSTANCES, SPIRE MARKETING MAY REQUIRE CREDIT ASSURANCES SUCH AS PREPAYMENTS, LETTERS OF CREDIT, OR PARENTAL GUARANTEES. IN ADDITION, SPIRE MARKETING MAY ENTER INTO NETTING ARRANGEMENTS TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK WITH COUNTERPARTIES IN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY WITH WHOM IT CONDUCTS BOTH SALES AND PURCHASES OF NATURAL GAS. SALES ARE TYPICALLY MADE ON AN UNSECURED CREDIT BASIS WITH PAYMENT DUE THE MONTH FOLLOWING DELIVERY. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AMOUNTS ARE CLOSELY MONITORED AND PROVISIONS FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS ARE ACCRUED WHEN LOSSES ARE PROBABLE. SPIRE MARKETING RECORDS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AND PREPAYMENTS FOR PHYSICAL SALES AND PURCHASES OF NATURAL GAS ON A GROSS BASIS. THE AMOUNT INCLUDED IN ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ATTRIBUTABLE TO ENERGY PRODUCERS AND THEIR MARKETING AFFILIATES TOTALED $18.1 AT MARCH 31, 2019 ($7.3 REFLECTING NETTING ARRANGEMENTS). SPIRE MARKETING\u2019S ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ATTRIBUTABLE TO UTILITY COMPANIES AND THEIR MARKETING AFFILIATES TOTALED $94.8 AT MARCH 31, 2019 ($84.0 REFLECTING NETTING ARRANGEMENTS).  SPIRE MARKETING ALSO HAS CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK WITH PIPELINE COMPANIES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS NATURAL GAS RECEIVABLE AND WITH CERTAIN INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT COUNTERPARTIES. AT MARCH 31, 2019, THE AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM ITS FIVE LARGEST COUNTERPARTIES (IN TERMS OF NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE EXPOSURE) TOTALED $31.5 ($27.3 REFLECTING NETTING ARRANGEMENTS). FOUR OF THESE FIVE COUNTERPARTIES ARE INVESTMENT-GRADE RATED COMPANIES. THE FIFTH IS NOT RATED BUT IS A SUBSIDIARY OF AN INVESTMENT-GRADE RATED COMPANY.  9  .

MANAGEMENT, AFTER DISCUSSION WITH COUNSEL, BELIEVES THE FINAL OUTCOME WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE STATEMENTS OF INCOME, BALANCE SHEETS, AND STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS OF THE COMPANY, SPIRE MISSOURI, OR SPIRE ALABAMA. HOWEVER, THERE IS UNCERTAINTY IN THE VALUATION OF PENDING CLAIMS AND PREDICTION OF LITIGATION RESULTS.  THE COMPANY AND THE UTILITIES OWN AND OPERATE NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION, TRANSMISSION, AND STORAGE FACILITIES, THE OPERATIONS OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND INTERPRETATIONS. WHILE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES RESULTING FROM SUCH OPERATIONS ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, SUCH ISSUES HAVE NOT MATERIALLY AFFECTED THE COMPANY\u2019S OR UTILITIES\u2019 FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. AS ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND THEIR INTERPRETATIONS CHANGE, THE COMPANY OR THE UTILITIES MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES THAT MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS, WHICH MAY BE MATERIAL.  IN THE NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY, MANY GAS DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES HAVE INCURRED ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH SITES THEY OR THEIR PREDECESSOR COMPANIES FORMERLY OWNED OR OPERATED WHERE MANUFACTURED GAS OPERATIONS TOOK PLACE. THE UTILITIES EACH HAVE FORMER MANUFACTURED GAS PLANT (\u201cMGP\u201d) OPERATIONS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE SERVICE TERRITORIES. TO THE EXTENT COSTS ARE INCURRED ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES, THE UTILITIES WOULD REQUEST AUTHORITY FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE REGULATORS TO DEFER SUCH COSTS (LESS ANY AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM INSURANCE PROCEEDS OR AS CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES (\u201cPRPS\u201d)) AND COLLECT THEM THROUGH FUTURE RATES.  41  SPIRE MISSOURI  SPIRE MISSOURI HAS IDENTIFIED THREE FORMER MGP SITES IN THE CITY OF ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI (THE \u201cCITY\u201d) WHERE COSTS HAVE BEEN INCURRED AND CLAIMS HAVE BEEN ASSERTED. SPIRE MISSOURI HAS ENROLLED TWO OF THE SITES IN THE MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES (\u201cMDNR\u201d) BROWNFIELDS/VOLUNTARY CLEANUP PROGRAM (\u201cBVCP\u201d). THE THIRD SITE IS THE RESULT OF A RELATIVELY NEW CLAIM ASSERTION BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (\u201cEPA\u201d) AND SUCH CLAIM IS CURRENTLY BEING INVESTIGATED.  IN CONJUNCTION WITH REDEVELOPMENT OF ONE OF THE SITES, SPIRE MISSOURI AND ANOTHER FORMER OWNER OF THE SITE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT (THE \u201cREMEDIATION AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH THE CITY DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES, THE DEVELOPER, AND AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT THAT OBLIGATES ONE OF THE CITY AGENCIES AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT TO REMEDIATE THE SITE AND OBTAIN A NO FURTHER ACTION LETTER FROM THE MDNR. THE REMEDIATION AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDES FOR A RELEASE OF SPIRE MISSOURI AND THE OTHER FORMER SITE OWNER FROM CERTAIN LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE PAST AND CURRENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF THE SITE AND REQUIRES THE DEVELOPER AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE, INCLUDING REMEDIATION COST CONTAINMENT, PREMISES POLLUTION LIABILITY, AND PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY. THE OPERATIVE PROVISIONS OF THE REMEDIATION AGREEMENT WERE TRIGGERED ON DECEMBER 20, 2010, ON WHICH DATE SPIRE MISSOURI AND THE OTHER FORMER SITE OWNER, AS FULL CONSIDERATION UNDER THE REMEDIATION AGREEMENT, PAID A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE COST OF REMEDIATION OF THE SITE. THE AMOUNT PAID BY SPIRE MISSOURI DID NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS OF THE COMPANY.  SPIRE MISSOURI HAS NOT OWNED THE SECOND SITE FOR MANY YEARS. IN A LETTER DATED JUNE 29, 2011, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE STATE OF MISSOURI INFORMED SPIRE MISSOURI THAT THE MDNR HAD COMPLETED AN INVESTIGATION OF THE SITE. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL REQUESTED THAT SPIRE MISSOURI PARTICIPATE IN THE FOLLOW UP INVESTIGATIONS OF THE SITE. IN A LETTER DATED JANUARY 10, 2012, SPIRE MISSOURI STATED THAT IT WOULD PARTICIPATE IN FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE ACTIVITIES AT THE SITE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER PRPS THAT ARE WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE TO SUCH EFFORTS IN A MEANINGFUL AND EQUITABLE FASHION. ACCORDINGLY, SPIRE MISSOURI ENTERED INTO A COST SHARING AGREEMENT FOR REMEDIAL INVESTIGATION WITH OTHER PRPS. TO DATE, MDNR HAS NOT APPROVED THE AGREEMENT, SO REMEDIAL INVESTIGATION HAS NOT YET OCCURRED.  ADDITIONALLY, IN CORRESPONDENCE DATED NOVEMBER 30, 2016, REGION 7 OF THE EPA HAS ASSERTED THAT SPIRE MISSOURI IS LIABLE UNDER SECTION 107(A) OF THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION, AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980 (\u201cCERCLA\u201d) FOR ALLEGED COAL GAS WASTE CONTAMINATION AT A THIRD SITE IN THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE CITY ON WHICH SPIRE MISSOURI OPERATED A MGP. SPIRE MISSOURI HAS NOT OWNED OR OPERATED THE SITE FOR OVER 70 YEARS. SPIRE MISSOURI AND THE SITE OWNER HAVE MET WITH THE EPA AND REVIEWED ITS ASSERTIONS. BOTH SPIRE MISSOURI AND THE SITE OWNER HAVE NOTIFIED THE EPA THAT INFORMATION AND DATA PROVIDED BY THE EPA TO DATE DOES NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF DOCUMENTING A THREAT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH OR ENVIRONMENT. AS SUCH, SPIRE MISSOURI REQUESTED MORE INFORMATION FROM THE EPA, SOME OF WHICH WOULD ALSO BE UTILIZED TO IDENTIFY OTHER FORMER OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF THE SITE THAT COULD BE ADDED AS PRPS. TO DATE, SPIRE MISSOURI HAS NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM THE EPA.  SPIRE MISSOURI HAS NOTIFIED ITS INSURERS THAT IT SEEKS REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PAST AND FUTURE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MGP SITES. WHILE SOME OF THE INSURERS HAVE DENIED COVERAGE AND RESERVED THEIR RIGHTS, SPIRE MISSOURI RETAINS THE RIGHT TO SEEK POTENTIAL REIMBURSEMENTS FROM THEM.  ON MARCH 10, 2015, SPIRE MISSOURI RECEIVED A SECTION 104(E) INFORMATION REQUEST UNDER CERCLA FROM EPA REGION 7 REGARDING THE FORMER THOMPSON CHEMICAL/SUPERIOR SOLVENTS SITE IN THE CITY. IN TURN, SPIRE MISSOURI ISSUED A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (\u201cFOIA\u201d) REQUEST TO THE EPA ON APRIL 3, 2015, IN AN EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THE BASIS OF THE INQUIRY. THE FOIA RESPONSE FROM THE EPA WAS RECEIVED ON JULY 15, 2015 AND A RESPONSE WAS PROVIDED TO THE EPA ON AUGUST 15, 2015. SPIRE MISSOURI HAS RECEIVED NO FURTHER INQUIRY FROM THE EPA REGARDING THIS MATTER.  42  IN ITS WESTERN SERVICE AREA, SPIRE MISSOURI HAS SEVEN OWNED MGP SITES ENROLLED IN THE BVCP, INCLUDING JOPLIN MGP #1, ST. JOSEPH MGP #1, KA  NSAS CITY COAL GAS STATION B, KANSAS CITY STATION A RAILROAD AREA, KANSAS CITY COAL GAS STATION A NORTH, KANSAS CITY COAL GAS STATION A SOUTH, AND INDEPENDENCE MGP #2. SOURCE REMOVAL HAS BEEN CONDUCTED AT ALL OF THE OWNED SITES SINCE 2003 WITH THE EXCEPTIO  N OF JOPLIN. ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2016, A REQUEST WAS MADE WITH THE MDNR FOR A RESTRICTIVE COVENANT USE LIMITATION WITH RESPECT TO JOPLIN. REMEDIATION EFFORTS AT THE SEVEN SITES ARE AT VARIOUS STAGES OF COMPLETION, RANGING FROM GROUNDWATER MONITORING AND SAMPL  ING FOLLOWING SOURCE REMOVAL ACTIVITIES TO THE AFOREMENTIONED REQUEST IN RESPECT TO JOPLIN. AS PART OF ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE BVCP,  SPIRE MISSOURI  COMMUNICATES REGULARLY WITH THE MDNR WITH RESPECT TO ITS REMEDIATION EFFORTS AND MONITORING ACTIVITIES AT T  HESE SITES. ON MAY 11, 2015, MDNR APPROVED THE NEXT PHASE OF INVESTIGATION AT THE KANSAS CITY STATION A NORTH AND RAILROAD AREAS.  TO DATE, COSTS INCURRED FOR ALL MISSOURI UTILITIES\u2019 MGP SITES FOR INVESTIGATION, REMEDIATION AND MONITORING THESE SITES HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL. HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT OF COSTS RELATIVE TO FUTURE REMEDIAL ACTIONS AT THESE AND OTHER SITES IS UNKNOWN AND MAY BE MATERIAL. THE ACTUAL FUTURE COSTS THAT SPIRE MISSOURI MAY INCUR COULD BE MATERIALLY HIGHER OR LOWER DEPENDING UPON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING WHETHER REMEDIATION ACTIONS WILL BE REQUIRED, FINAL SELECTION AND REGULATORY APPROVAL OF ANY REMEDIAL ACTIONS, CHANGING TECHNOLOGIES AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, THE ULTIMATE ABILITY OF OTHER PRPS TO PAY, AND ANY INSURANCE RECOVERIES.  IN 2013, SPIRE MISSOURI RETAINED AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT TO CONDUCT PROBABILISTIC COST MODELING OF 19 FORMER MGP SITES OWNED OR OPERATED BY SPIRE MISSOURI. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANALYSIS WAS TO DEVELOP AN ESTIMATED RANGE OF PROBABILISTIC FUTURE LIABILITY FOR EACH SITE. THAT ANALYSIS, COMPLETED IN AUGUST 2014, PROVIDED A RANGE OF DEMONSTRATED POSSIBLE FUTURE EXPENDITURES TO INVESTIGATE, MONITOR AND REMEDIATE ALL 19 MGP SITES. SPIRE MISSOURI HAS RECORDED ITS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE PROBABLE EXPENDITURES THAT RELATE TO THESE MATTERS. THE AMOUNT IS NOT MATERIAL.  SPIRE MISSOURI AND THE COMPANY DO NOT EXPECT POTENTIAL LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM REMEDIATING THESE SITES TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THEIR FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  SPIRE ALABAMA  ON DECEMBER 17, 2013, AN INCIDENT OCCURRED AT A HOUSING AUTHORITY APARTMENT COMPLEX IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA THAT RESULTED IN ONE FATALITY, PERSONAL INJURIES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE. SPIRE ALABAMA COOPERATED WITH THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD (\u201cNTSB\u201d) WHICH INVESTIGATED THE INCIDENT. THE NTSB REPORT OF FINDINGS WAS ISSUED ON MARCH 30, 2016 AND NO SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS, FINES, OR PENALTIES WERE CONTAINED THEREIN. SPIRE ALABAMA HAS BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN SEVERAL LAWSUITS ARISING FROM THE INCIDENT, SOME OF WHICH REMAIN PENDING. SPIRE ALABAMA DOES NOT EXPECT POTENTIAL LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM THESE LAWSUITS TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  SPIRE ALABAMA IS IN THE CHAIN OF TITLE OF NINE FORMER MGP SITES, FOUR OF WHICH IT STILL OWNS, AND FIVE FORMER MANUFACTURED GAS DISTRIBUTION SITES, ONE OF WHICH IT STILL OWNS. SPIRE ALABAMA DOES NOT FORESEE A PROBABLE OR REASONABLY ESTIMABLE LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SITES. SPIRE ALABAMA AND THE COMPANY DO NOT EXPECT POTENTIAL LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM REMEDIATING THESE SITES TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THEIR FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN 2012, SPIRE ALABAMA RESPONDED TO AN EPA REQUEST FOR INFORMATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 104 OF CERCLA RELATING TO THE 35TH AVENUE SUPERFUND SITE LOCATED IN NORTH BIRMINGHAM, JEFFERSON COUNTY, ALABAMA. SPIRE ALABAMA WAS IDENTIFIED AS A PRP UNDER CERCLA FOR THE CLEANUP OF THE SITE OR COSTS THE EPA INCURS IN CLEANING UP THE SITE. AT THIS POINT, SPIRE ALABAMA HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW IT TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT, IF ANY, OF ITS POTENTIAL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE 35TH AVENUE SUPERFUND SITE AND VIGOROUSLY DENIES ITS INCLUSION AS A PRP.  SPIRE  IN ADDITION TO THOSE DISCUSSED ABOVE FOR SPIRE MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA, SPIRE IS AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING CONTINGENT MATTERS.  SINCE APRIL 2012, A TOTAL OF 14 LAWSUITS ENCOMPASSING MORE THAN 1,600 PLAINTIFFS HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST SPIRE GULF IN MOBILE COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT ALLEGING THAT IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2008, SPIRE GULF SPILLED TERT-BUTYL MERCAPTAN, AN  43  ODORANT ADDED TO NATURAL GAS FOR SAFETY REASONS, IN EIGHT MILE, ALABAMA. ALL OF THE LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY SETTLED, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 13 INDIVIDUALS WHO REJECTED THEIR  SETTLEMENT OFFERS AND WHOSE CLAIMS REMAIN PENDING. THOSE REMAINING CLAIMS ALLEGE NUISANCE, FRAUD AND NEGLIGENCE CAUSES OF ACTIONS AND SEEK UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. A CLAIM HAS BEEN MADE AGAINST THE INSURANCE CARRIERS REQUESTING REIMBU  RSEMENT FOR COSTS ACCRUED IN RESPECT TO THIS SPILL, AND A RELATED RECEIVABLE HAS BEEN RECORDED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT POTENTIAL LIABILITIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM THESE LAWSUITS TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF O  PERATIONS.  12  . INCOME TAXES  THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\u201cTCJA\u201d) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, WITH AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF JANUARY 1, 2018, FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PROVISIONS. THE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS RELATED TO REGULATED PUBLIC UTILITIES IN THE TCJA GENERALLY ALLOW FOR THE CONTINUED DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST EXPENSE, THE ELIMINATION OF FULL EXPENSING FOR TAX PURPOSES OF CERTAIN PROPERTY ACQUIRED AFTER SEPTEMBER 27, 2017, AND THE CONTINUATION OF CERTAIN RATE NORMALIZATION REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION BENEFITS. THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY (\u201cTREASURY\u201d) HAS ISSUED PROPOSED REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST EXPENSE, BUT FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS IS EXPECTED. TREASURY HAS ALSO ISSUED PROPOSED REGULATIONS ON BONUS DEPRECIATION WHICH ALLOW FULL EXPENSING FOR CERTAIN PROPERTY ACQUIRED IN TAX YEARS BEGINNING PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2018.  AS INDICATED IN  NOTE 1  , SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, THE COMPANY\u2019S REGULATED OPERATIONS ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES IS IMPACTED BY ASC 980,  REGULATED OPERATIONS  . REDUCTIONS IN DEFERRED INCOME TAX BALANCES DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN THE CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE WILL RESULT IN AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY COLLECTED FROM UTILITY CUSTOMERS FOR THESE DEFERRED TAXES TO BE REFUNDABLE TO SUCH CUSTOMERS, GENERALLY THROUGH REDUCTIONS IN FUTURE RATES. THE TCJA INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT STIPULATE HOW THESE EXCESS DEFERRED TAXES ARE TO BE PASSED BACK TO CUSTOMERS FOR CERTAIN ACCELERATED TAX DEPRECIATION BENEFITS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, THE MOPSC AMENDED REPORT AND ORDER TOOK EFFECT AND THE ESTIMATED EXCESS ACCUMULATED DEFERRED INCOME TAX BEGAN TO BE RETURNED TO CUSTOMERS IN RATES. THE AMOUNT BEING RETURNED IS ESTIMATED WITH A TRACKER ESTABLISHED TO DEFER THE DIFFERENCE FROM THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS TO THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS ONCE THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN CALCULATED. DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, SPIRE MISSOURI RETURNED EXCESS ACCUMULATED DEFERRED TAXES OF $2.1 AND $4.2, RESPECTIVELY. THE TREATMENT FOR ACCUMULATED DEFERRED INCOME TAX BALANCES FOR SPIRE ALABAMA, SPIRE GULF AND SPIRE MISSISSIPPI IS YET TO BE DETERMINED BY STATE REGULATORS.  44  ITEM 2. M  ANAGEMENT\u2019S  D  ISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCI  AL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER UNIT AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  THIS SECTION ANALYZES THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF SPIRE INC. (\u201cSPIRE\u201d OR THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d), SPIRE MISSOURI INC. (\u201cSPIRE MISSOURI\u201d OR THE \u201cMISSOURI UTILITIES\u201d), AND SPIRE ALABAMA INC. (\u201cSPIRE ALABAMA\u201d). SPIRE MISSOURI, SPIRE ALABAMA, AND SPIRE ENERGYSOUTH INC. (\u201cSPIRE ENERGYSOUTH\u201d) ARE WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY. SPIRE MISSOURI, SPIRE ALABAMA AND THE SUBSIDIARIES OF SPIRE ENERGYSOUTH, ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE \u201cUTILITIES.\u201d THE SUBSIDIARIES OF SPIRE ENERGYSOUTH ARE SPIRE GULF INC. (\u201cSPIRE GULF\u201d) AND SPIRE MISSISSIPPI INC. (\u201cSPIRE MISSISSIPPI\u201d). THIS SECTION INCLUDES MANAGEMENT\u2019S VIEW OF FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES OF THE COMPANY, SPIRE MISSOURI, AND SPIRE ALABAMA, EXPLANATIONS OF FINANCIAL RESULTS INCLUDING CHANGES IN EARNINGS AND COSTS FROM THE PRIOR PERIODS, AND THE EFFECTS OF SUCH FACTORS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S, SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S AND SPIRE ALABAMA\u2019S OVERALL FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY.  CERTAIN MATTERS DISCUSSED IN THIS REPORT, EXCLUDING HISTORICAL INFORMATION, INCLUDE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S AND SPIRE ALABAMA\u2019S CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE NOTES THERETO.  OVERVIEW  THE COMPANY HAS TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: GAS UTILITY AND GAS MARKETING. NEARLY ALL OF SPIRE\u2019S EARNINGS ARE DERIVED FROM ITS GAS UTILITY SEGMENT, WHICH REFLECTS THE REGULATED ACTIVITIES OF THE UTILITIES. THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT CONSISTS OF THE REGULATED BUSINESSES OF SPIRE MISSOURI, SPIRE ALABAMA AND THE SUBSIDIARIES OF SPIRE ENERGYSOUTH. DUE TO THE SEASONAL NATURE OF THE UTILITIES\u2019 BUSINESS, EARNINGS OF SPIRE, SPIRE MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA ARE TYPICALLY CONCENTRATED DURING THE HEATING SEASON OF NOVEMBER THROUGH APRIL EACH FISCAL YEAR.  GAS UTILITY - SPIRE MISSOURI  SPIRE MISSOURI IS MISSOURI\u2019S LARGEST NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION UTILITY AND IS REGULATED BY THE MISSOURI PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (\u201cMOPSC\u201d). SPIRE MISSOURI SERVES ST. LOUIS AND EASTERN MISSOURI THROUGH SPIRE MISSOURI EAST AND SERVES KANSAS CITY AND WESTERN MISSOURI THROUGH SPIRE MISSOURI WEST. SPIRE MISSOURI PURCHASES NATURAL GAS IN THE WHOLESALE MARKET FROM PRODUCERS AND MARKETERS AND SHIPS THE GAS THROUGH INTERSTATE PIPELINES INTO OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES FOR SALE TO RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS. SPIRE MISSOURI ALSO TRANSPORTS GAS THROUGH ITS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM FOR CERTAIN LARGER CUSTOMERS WHO BUY THEIR OWN GAS ON THE WHOLESALE MARKET. SPIRE MISSOURI DELIVERS NATURAL GAS TO CUSTOMERS AT RATES AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH TARIFFS AUTHORIZED BY THE MOPSC. THE EARNINGS OF SPIRE MISSOURI ARE PRIMARILY GENERATED BY THE SALE OF HEATING ENERGY. THE RATE DESIGN FOR EACH SERVICE TERRITORY SERVES TO LESSEN THE IMPACT OF WEATHER VOLATILITY ON ITS CUSTOMERS DURING COLD WINTERS AND STABILIZE SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S EARNINGS.  GAS UTILITY - SPIRE ALABAMA  SPIRE ALABAMA IS THE LARGEST NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION UTILITY IN THE STATE OF ALABAMA. SPIRE ALABAMA\u2019S SERVICE TERRITORY IS LOCATED IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN ALABAMA. AMONG THE CITIES SERVED BY SPIRE ALABAMA ARE BIRMINGHAM, THE CENTER OF THE LARGEST METROPOLITAN AREA IN THE STATE, AND MONTGOMERY, THE STATE CAPITAL. SPIRE ALABAMA IS REGULATED BY THE ALABAMA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (\u201cAPSC\u201d). SPIRE ALABAMA PURCHASES NATURAL GAS THROUGH INTERSTATE AND INTRASTATE SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTES THE PURCHASED GAS THROUGH ITS DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES FOR SALE TO RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL, AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS AND OTHER END-USERS OF NATURAL GAS. SPIRE ALABAMA ALSO PROVIDES TRANSPORTATION SERVICES TO LARGE INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS LOCATED ON ITS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. THESE TRANSPORTATION CUSTOMERS, USING SPIRE ALABAMA AS THEIR AGENT OR ACTING ON THEIR OWN, PURCHASE GAS DIRECTLY FROM MARKETERS OR SUPPLIERS AND ARRANGE FOR DELIVERY OF THE GAS INTO THE SPIRE ALABAMA DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. SPIRE ALABAMA CHARGES A FEE TO TRANSPORT SUCH CUSTOMER-OWNED GAS THROUGH ITS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM TO THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 FACILITIES.  46  GAS UTILITY - SPIRE ENERGYSOUTH  SPIRE GULF AND SPIRE MISSISSIPPI ARE UTILITIES ENGAGED IN THE PURCHASE, RETAIL DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF NATURAL GAS TO 0.1 MILLION CUSTOMERS IN SOUTHERN ALABAMA AND SOUTH-CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. SPIRE GULF IS REGULATED BY THE APSC AND SPIRE MISSISSIPPI IS REGULATED BY THE MISSISSIPPI PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (\u201cMSPSC\u201d).  GAS MARKETING  SPIRE MARKETING INC. (\u201cSPIRE MARKETING\u201d) IS ENGAGED IN THE MARKETING OF NATURAL GAS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES ON A NON-REGULATED BASIS AND IS REPORTED IN THE GAS MARKETING SEGMENT. SPIRE MARKETING MARKETS NATURAL GAS ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN UNITED STATES (\u201cU.S.\u201d). IT HOLDS FIRM TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE CONTRACTS IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ITS TRANSACTIONS WITH COUNTERPARTIES, WHICH PRIMARILY INCLUDE PRODUCERS, MUNICIPALITIES, ELECTRIC AND GAS UTILITY COMPANIES, AND LARGE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS.  OTHER  OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION INCLUDE.  \u2022  UNALLOCATED CORPORATE ITEMS, INCLUDING CERTAIN DEBT AND ASSOCIATED INTEREST COSTS;  \u2022  SPIRE STL PIPELINE LLC (\u201cSTL PIPELINE\u201d) AND SPIRE STORAGE WEST LLC (\u201cSPIRE STORAGE\u201d), DESCRIBED BELOW; AND  \u2022  SPIRE\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES ENGAGED IN THE OPERATION OF A PROPANE PIPELINE, COMPRESSION OF NATURAL GAS, AND RISK MANAGEMENT, AMONG OTHER ACTIVITIES.  SPIRE STL PIPELINE LLC IS A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF SPIRE CONSTRUCTING AND PLANNING THE OPERATION OF A 65-MILE PIPELINE TO CONNECT TO THE ROCKIES EXPRESS PIPELINE IN SCOTT COUNTY, ILLINOIS, TO DELIVERY POINTS IN ST. LOUIS COUNTY, MISSOURI, INCLUDING SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S STORAGE FACILITY. THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION (\u201cFERC\u201d) ISSUED A CERTIFICATE OF PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY IN AUGUST 2018 AND A NOTICE TO PROCEED IN NOVEMBER 2018, ALLOWING CONSTRUCTION TO BEGIN. THE PIPELINE WILL OPERATE UNDER FERC JURISDICTION AND WILL BE CAPABLE OF DELIVERING UP TO 4 MILLION THERMS PER DAY OF NATURAL GAS INTO EASTERN MISSOURI. SPIRE MISSOURI WILL BE THE FOUNDATIONAL SHIPPER WITH A CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENT OF 3.5 MILLION THERMS PER DAY. CONSTRUCTION IS UNDERWAY AND IS ANTICIPATED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR.  SPIRE STORAGE IS ENGAGED IN THE STORAGE OF NATURAL GAS IN THE WESTERN REGION OF THE UNITED STATES. SPIRE STORAGE CONSISTS OF TWO ADJACENT STORAGE FACILITIES: RYCKMAN CREEK ACQUIRED IN DECEMBER 2017 AND CLEAR CREEK ACQUIRED IN MAY 2018. THE ACQUISITION OF CLEAR CREEK CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP A LARGER, MORE FLEXIBLE, AND MORE RELIABLE COMBINED STORAGE PLATFORM THAT OPTIMIZES THE COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY IN THE REGION. ACCORDINGLY, SPIRE STORAGE FILED AN APPLICATION WITH THE FERC TO OPERATE BOTH FACILITIES IN AN INTEGRATED FASHION UNDER A SINGLE MARKET-BASED TARIFF, WHICH THE FERC APPROVED SEVEN MONTHS LATER ON JANUARY 25, 2019. THE TIMING OF THE FERC APPROVAL, COUPLED WITH THE ADDITIONAL REVIEW OF THE GEOLOGICAL AND OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES OF THE COMBINED FACILITIES, HAS LENGTHENED THE TIME REQUIRED TO FINALIZE A NEW DEVELOPMENT PLAN THAT WILL POSITION SPIRE STORAGE TO OPTIMIZE THE COMBINED FACILITIES. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE FINAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN WILL RESULT IN ADDED INVESTMENTS IN RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND PIPELINE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE FACILITIES AND WITH NEARLY INTERSTATE PIPELINES TO ENSURE SPIRE STORAGE CAN DELIVER THE ENHANCED DELIVERABILITY, SERVICES AND VALUE THAT EXISTS IN THE REGION.  NON-GAAP MEASURES  NET INCOME, EARNINGS PER SHARE AND OPERATING INCOME REPORTED BY SPIRE, SPIRE MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d). SPIRE, SPIRE MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA ALSO PROVIDE THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES OF NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS, NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS PER SHARE AND CONTRIBUTION MARGIN. MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS USE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, IN ADDITION TO GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, TO UNDERSTAND AND COMPARE OPERATING RESULTS ACROSS ACCOUNTING PERIODS, FOR FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DECISION MAKING, FOR PLANNING AND FORECASTING, TO DETERMINE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND TO EVALUATE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THESE NON-GAAP OPERATING METRICS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVES TO, OR MORE MEANINGFUL THAN, THE RELATED GAAP MEASURES. RECONCILIATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURES ARE PROVIDED ON THE FOLLOWING PAGES.  47  NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS AND NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS PER SHARE  NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS AND NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS PER SHARE ARE NON-GAAP MEASURES THAT EXCLUDE FROM NET INCOME THE IMPACTS OF FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING AND TIMING ADJUSTMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY-RELATED TRANSACTIONS, THE IMPACTS OF ACQUISITION, DIVESTITURE AND RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, AND THE LARGELY NON-CASH IMPACTS OF OTHER NON-RECURRING OR UNUSUAL ITEMS SUCH AS CERTAIN REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE OR GAAP STANDARD-SETTING ACTIONS. IN FISCAL 2018, THESE ITEMS INCLUDED THE REVALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DUE TO THE FEDERAL TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT AND THE WRITE-OFF OF CERTAIN LONG-STANDING ASSETS AS A RESULT OF DISALLOWANCES IN OUR MISSOURI RATE PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDES THE IMPACT, IN THE FISCAL YEAR OF ISSUANCE, OF SHARES ISSUED TO FINANCE ACQUISITIONS THAT HAVE YET TO BE INCLUDED IN NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS.  THE FAIR VALUE AND TIMING ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE IN INSTANCES WHERE THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT DIFFERS FROM WHAT MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  NET UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON ENERGY-RELATED DERIVATIVES THAT ARE REQUIRED BY GAAP FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL AND PHYSICAL TRANSACTIONS PRIOR TO THEIR COMPLETION AND SETTLEMENT. THESE UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RESULT PRIMARILY FROM TWO SOURCES.  1)  CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF PHYSICAL AND/OR FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES PRIOR TO THE PERIOD OF SETTLEMENT; AND,  2)  INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF ACCOUNTING HEDGES, REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED IN EARNINGS PRIOR TO SETTLEMENT, DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN COMMODITY PRICE CHANGES BETWEEN THE LOCATIONS OF THE FORECASTED PHYSICAL PURCHASE OR SALE TRANSACTIONS AND THE LOCATIONS OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGE INSTRUMENTS;  \u2022  LOWER OF COST OR MARKET ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF COMMODITY INVENTORIES RESULTING WHEN THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMMODITY FALLS BELOW ITS ORIGINAL COST, TO THE EXTENT THAT THOSE COMMODITIES ARE ECONOMICALLY HEDGED; AND  \u2022  REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF ECONOMIC HEDGES PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THE PHYSICAL COMMODITY.  THESE ADJUSTMENTS ELIMINATE THE IMPACT OF TIMING DIFFERENCES AND THE IMPACT OF CURRENT CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL AND PHYSICAL TRANSACTIONS PRIOR TO THEIR COMPLETION AND SETTLEMENT. UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN EACH PERIOD UNTIL BEING REPLACED WITH THE ACTUAL GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED WHEN THE ASSOCIATED PHYSICAL TRANSACTIONS OCCUR. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT EXCLUDING THE EARNINGS VOLATILITY CAUSED BY RECOGNIZING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE PRIOR TO SETTLEMENT AND OTHER TIMING DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH RELATED PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS PROVIDES A USEFUL REPRESENTATION OF THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF ONLY THE ACTUAL SETTLED TRANSACTIONS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WHILE MANAGEMENT USES THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES TO EVALUATE BOTH SPIRE\u2019S UTILITIES AND ITS OTHER GAS-RELATED BUSINESSES, THE NET EFFECT OF THESE FAIR VALUE AND TIMING ADJUSTMENTS ON THE UTILITIES\u2019 EARNINGS IS MINIMAL BECAUSE GAINS OR LOSSES ON THEIR NATURAL GAS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE DEFERRED PURSUANT TO STATE REGULATION.  CONTRIBUTION MARGIN  IN ADDITION TO OPERATING REVENUES AND OPERATING EXPENSES, MANAGEMENT ALSO USES THE NON-GAAP MEASURE OF CONTRIBUTION MARGIN WHEN EVALUATING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CONTRIBUTION MARGIN IS DEFINED AS OPERATING REVENUES LESS NATURAL AND PROPANE GAS COSTS AND GROSS RECEIPTS TAX EXPENSE.

CONSOLIDATED  SPIRE\u2019S NET INCOME WAS $154.6 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED WITH $98.2 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WERE $3.05 AND $3.04, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $2.03 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. NET INCOME INCREASED $56.4, REFLECTING A $44.2 INCREASE IN THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT AND A $12.6 INCREASE IN GAS MARKETING. THE GAS UTILITY INCREASE REFLECTS A $38.4 ($23.6 AFTER-TAX) EXPENSE FOR MISSOURI RATE CASE WRITE-OFFS RECORDED IN THE PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER AND A RATE DESIGN CHANGE AT THE MISSOURI UTILITIES IN THE CURRENT QUARTER. GAS MARKETING NET INCOME INCREASED DUE TO A $20.7 ($15.3 AFTER-TAX) IMPROVEMENT IN DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, AS WELL AS THE BENEFIT OF ITS GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION, OFFSET BY A RETURN TO  MORE NORMALIZED BASIS DIFFERENTIALS IN THE CURRENT QUARTER AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  SPIRE\u2019S NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS WERE $147.9 ($2.90 PER DILUTED SHARE) FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, AN INCREASE OF $10.7 FROM THE $137.2 ($2.83 PER DILUTED SHARE) REPORTED FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER BOTH NET INCOME PER SHARE AND NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE IMPACTED BY 2.3 MILLION SHARES THAT WERE ISSUED IN MAY 2018. THE PRINCIPAL DRIVERS OF THE INCREASE IN NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS WAS THE RATE DESIGN IMPACT AT THE MISSOURI U  TILITIES, OFFSET PARTLY BY LOWER GAS MARKETING EARNINGS, AS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE. THESE IMPACTS ARE DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL BELOW.  49  GAS UTILITY  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS FOR THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT INCREASED $15.0 FROM THE SECOND QUARTER LAST YEAR, WITH EARNINGS GROWTH ACROSS ALL THE UTILITIES.  THE NEW RATE DESIGN AT THE MISSOURI UTILITIES LOWERED THE FIXED MONTHLY CHARGE AND INCREASED THE VOLUMETRIC COMPONENT, RESULTING IN THE SHIFTING OF REVENUES AND EARNINGS FROM APRIL - OCTOBER TO THE NOVEMBER - MARCH TIME PERIODS WHEN THE HIGHEST VOLUME OF GAS IS USED BY CUSTOMERS. THE UTILITIES ALSO EXPERIENCED $3.3 HIGHER OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE (\u201cO&M\u201d) EXPENSE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AFTER REMOVAL OF MISSOURI RATE CASE WRITE-OFFS AND A $9.6 NET QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER INCREASE DUE TO THE MIX OF SERVICE AND NON-SERVICE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS COSTS NOW RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE, COMBINED WITH HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSES RESULTING FROM THE CONTINUED INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AT ALL THE UTILITIES. THESE IMPACTS ARE DISCUSSED IN FURTHER DETAIL BELOW.  GAS MARKETING  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS FOR THE GAS MARKETING SEGMENT DECREASED $4.0 COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER LAST YEAR. SECOND QUARTER NEE WAS $6.2, DOWN FROM $10.2 IN THE PRIOR YEAR THAT INCLUDED INCREMENTAL EARNINGS FROM UNUSUALLY FAVORABLE WEATHER-DRIVEN MARKET CONDITIONS. THE SOLID PERFORMANCE IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD REFLECTS THE BENEFIT OF GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION THAT CREATED ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO OPTIMIZE THE SEGMENT\u2019S SUPPLY, TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE PORTFOLIO. THIS WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY A RETURN TO MORE NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS WITH NARROWER BASIS DIFFERENTIALS.  OTHER  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, NET ECONOMIC LOSS FOR OTHER INCREASED $0.3 COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER LAST YEAR. THIS INCREASE REFLECTS A $4.8 OPERATING LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH SPIRE STORAGE (WHERE OPERATING AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS WERE EXCLUDED FROM NEE IN THE PRIOR YEAR) AND HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO INCREASED SHORT-TERM RATES, BOTH OF WHICH WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY HIGHER ALLOWANCE FOR FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION (\u201cAFUDC\u201d) INCOME FOR SPIRE STL PIPELINE.

SPIRE\u2019S CONTRIBUTION MARGIN INCREASED $38.9 COMPARED WITH LAST YEAR, DUE TO INCREASES IN THE GAS UTILITY AND GAS MARKETING SEGMENTS OF $22.6 AND $17.1, RESPECTIVELY, BEFORE INTERSEGMENT ELIMINATIONS. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES WERE UP $3.3 IN THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT, REFLECTING THE HIGHER OVERALL CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ACROSS ALL UTILITIES. GAS UTILITY O&M EXPENSES IN THE QUARTER WERE $25.5 LOWER THAN THE PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY MISSOURI RATE CASE WRITE-OFFS OF $38.4 RECORDED IN THE PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER, OFFSET BY $9.6 NET QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER INCREASE DUE TO THE MIX OF SERVICE AND NON-SERVICE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS COSTS NOW RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. EXCLUDING THESE IMPACTS, GAS UTILITY O&M EXPENSES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $3.3 VERSUS THE SECOND QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AS A NET $4.0 INCREASE IN EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY COSTS FROM THE MISSOURI RATE CASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER OTHER DISCRETIONARY COSTS. THESE IMPACTS ARE DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL BELOW.  GAS UTILITY  OPERATING REVENUES  \u2013  GAS UTILITY OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WERE $776.8, OR $14.0 LOWER THAN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE IN GAS UTILITY OPERATING REVENUES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.  MISSOURI UTILITIES \u2013 2018 RATE CASE RESETS (NET OF TCJA GIVEBACK)  $19.6  SPIRE ALABAMA \u2013 RATE STABILIZATION AND EQUALIZATION (\u201cRSE\u201d): NET RENEWAL AND GIVEBACK  2.4  MISSOURI UTILITIES AND SPIRE ALABAMA \u2013 LOWER PGA/GSA COST RECOVERIES  (20.2  )  MISSOURI UTILITIES AND SPIRE ALABAMA \u2013 VOLUMETRIC USAGE (NET OF WEATHER MITIGATION)  (12.1  )  MISSOURI UTILITIES \u2013 OFF-SYSTEM SALES AND CAPACITY RELEASE  (3.6  )  ALL OTHER FACTORS  (0.1  )  TOTAL VARIATION  $(14.0  )  THE DECREASE IN REVENUES WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER GAS COST RECOVERIES, AND LOWER VOLUMETRIC USAGE. ALTHOUGH THE MISSOURI UTILITIES SAW A $3.3 INCREASE IN REVENUES DUE TO HIGHER VOLUMETRIC USAGE (NET OF WEATHER MITIGATION), WHICH WAS A FUNCTION OF COLDER WEATHER PATTERNS EXPERIENCED ACROSS THEIR SERVICE AREAS IN THE CURRENT QUARTER, SPIRE ALABAMA\u2019S USAGE DECLINED BY $15.4, MORE THAN OFFSETTING THE INCREASE IN MISSOURI. THESE IMPACTS WERE ONLY PARTLY OFFSET BY THE $19.6 INCREASE IN REVENUES DUE TO RATE DESIGN CHANGES (NET OF TCJA GIVEBACK) AT THE MISSOURI UTILITIES AS A RESULT OF THE 2018 RATE CASES, AND THE $2.4 RSE REGULATORY ADJUSTMENT AT SPIRE ALABAMA. THE NEW MISSOURI RATE DESIGN LOWERED THE FIXED MONTHLY CHARGE AND INCREASED THE VOLUMETRIC COMPONENT, RESULTING IN THE SHIFTING OF REVENUES FROM APRIL - OCTOBER TO THE NOVEMBER - MARCH TIME PERIODS WHEN THE HIGHEST VOLUME OF GAS IS USED BY CUSTOMERS.  CONTRIBUTION MARGIN  \u2013 GAS UTILITY CONTRIBUTION MARGIN WAS $366.7 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, A $22.6 INCREASE OVER THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.  MISSOURI UTILITIES \u2013 2018 RATE CASE RESETS (NET OF TCJA GIVEBACK)  $19.6  SPIRE ALABAMA \u2013 RSE: NET RENEWAL AND GIVEBACK  2.4  MISSOURI UTILITIES AND SPIRE ALABAMA \u2013 VOLUMETRIC USAGE (NET OF WEATHER MITIGATION)  (1.5  )  ALL OTHER FACTORS  2.1  TOTAL VARIATION  $22.6  THE INCREASE IN CONTRIBUTION MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MISSOURI UTILITIES\u2019 RATE CASE RESETS, AS DISCUSSED UNDER OPERATING REVENUES ABOVE. CONTRIBUTION MARGIN WAS ALSO SLIGHTLY FAVORABLE DUE TO THE $2.4 RSE ADJUSTMENT AT SPIRE ALABAMA. OFFSETTING THESE POSITIVE IMPACTS WAS A SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE VOLUME USAGE IMPACT (NET OF WEATHER MITIGATION) OF $1.5.  51  OPERATING EXPENSES  \u2013 O&M EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WERE $25.5 LOWER THAN THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE  DECREASE REFLECTS $38.4 IN  MISSOURI RATE CASE  WRITE-OFFS  IN THE PRIOR YEAR,  OFFSET BY $9.6 NET  QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER INCREASE DUE TO THE MIX OF SERVICE AND NON-SERVICE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS COSTS NOW RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.  EXCLUDING THESE ADJUSTMENTS, O&M INCREASED $3.3 VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO  HIGHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS  AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY COSTS  RESULTING FROM THE 2018 MISSOURI RATE CASES OF $4.0, WITH OTHER DISCRETIONARY SPEND DOWN MARGINALLY FROM LAST YEAR.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, INCREASED $3.  3  FROM LAST YEAR  , THE RESULT OF HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ACROSS ALL  THE  UTILITIES.  GAS MARKETING  OPERATING REVENUES  \u2013 OPERATING REVENUES INCREASED $4.2 VERSUS THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD RESULTING FROM HIGHER VOLUMETRIC GAS SALES, HIGHER TRANSPORT ACTIVITY AND HIGHER GENERAL PRICING. AVERAGE PRICING FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.969/MMBTU VERSUS APPROXIMATELY $2.828/MMBTU FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  CONTRIBUTION MARGIN  \u2013 GAS MARKETING CONTRIBUTION MARGIN DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 INCREASED $17.1 FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, LARGELY REFLECTING A $20.7 INCREASE OF GAS CONTRACT DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY EXCLUDED FROM NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS. EXCLUDING THESE GAINS, MARGINS DECREASED BY $3.6 FROM THE PRIOR YEAR REFLECTING A RETURN TO MORE NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS WITH NARROWER BASIS DIFFERENTIALS, OFFSET IN PART BY GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION THAT CREATED ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO OPTIMIZE THE SEGMENT\u2019S SUPPLY, TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE PORTFOLIO.  INTEREST CHARGES  CONSOLIDATED INTEREST CHARGES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, INCREASED BY $2.2 FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NET LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCES AND HIGHER RATES AND LEVELS OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, AVERAGE SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS WERE $573.1 AND $545.8, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATES ON THESE BORROWINGS WERE 2.93% AND 2.05%, RESPECTIVELY. PARTLY OFFSETTING THESE FACTORS WAS AN INCREASE IN THE NON-CASH AFUDC INCOME FOR SPIRE STL PIPELINE COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  INCOME TAXES  CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, INCREASED $14.5 FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PRE-TAX BOOK INCOME AND THE PRIOR YEAR BENEFITING FROM A TCJA ADJUSTMENT, OFFSET IN PART BY THE AMORTIZATION OF EXCESS DEFERRED TAXES IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

CONTRIBUTION MARGIN FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, INCREASED $19.3  FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, LARGELY DUE TO  THE  $19.6  FROM THE RATE DESIGN CHANGES MENTIONED AB  OVE.  O&M EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 DECREASED $23.3 PRIMARILY DUE TO $38.4 IN MISSOURI RATE CASE WRITE-OFFS RECORDED IN THE PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER,  OFFSET BY $9.6 NET QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER INCREASE DUE TO THE MIX OF SERVICE AND NON-SERVICE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS COSTS NOW RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. EXCLUDING THESE ITEMS, OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED BY $5.5, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN HIGHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY COSTS RESULTING FROM THE 2018 RATE CASE THAT IS FULLY RECOVERED IN OPERATING REVENUES. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED $2.6 IN THE CURRENT QUARTER VERSUS THE PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER DUE TO HIGHER CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.  FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, NET INCOME INCREASED $41.6 VERSUS THE PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE $23.6 AFTER-TAX RATE CASE CHARGE IN THE PRIOR YEAR, COMBINED WITH THE HIGHER CONTRIBUTION MARGIN IN THE CURRENT-YEAR QUARTER.  DEGREE DAYS IN SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S SERVICE AREAS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WERE 10% COLDER THAN NORMAL AND 6% COLDER THAN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, RESULTING IN HIGHER USAGE ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARATIVE BASIS. THE MISSOURI UTILITIES\u2019 TOTAL SYSTEM THERMS SOLD AND TRANSPORTED WERE 829.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED WITH 786.5 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. TOTAL OFF-SYSTEM THERMS SOLD AND TRANSPORTED WERE 11.7 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED WITH 37.0 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, AS A 5% INCREASE IN CURRENT-YEAR SYSTEM DEMAND REDUCED THERM AVAILABILITY FOR OFF-SYSTEM SALES. REVENUES AND MARGINS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED FROM COLDER WEATHER DUE TO WEATHER MITIGATION IN OUR RATE DESIGN.

THE CHANGE IN OPERATING REVENUE WAS DRIVEN PRINCIPALLY BY A $22.9 DECREASE IN GAS COST RECOVERIES VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR AND LOWER CURRENT-YEAR VOLUMETRIC USAGE IMPACTS OF $15.4. CONTRIBUTION MARGIN INCREASED $1.5, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 2019 RATE RESET (RSE RENEWAL AND GIVEBACK) OF $2.4, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER VOLUMES.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WERE $0.6 HIGHER THAN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, THE RESULT OF CONTINUED INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. O&M EXPENSES WERE $1.8 LOWER, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS.  AS MEASURED IN DEGREE DAYS, TEMPERATURES IN SPIRE ALABAMA\u2019S SERVICE AREA DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WERE 21% WARMER THAN NORMAL AND 18% WARMER THAN A YEAR AGO.

BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WERE $4.37 AND $4.36, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $4.43 AND $4.42, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME OF $7.7 REFLECTS A $54.0 PRIOR YEAR INCOME BENEFIT RELATING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TCJA, PARTLY OFFSET BY $38.4 IN PRE-TAX ($23.6 AFTER-TAX) EXPENSE FOR MISSOURI RATE CASE WRITE-OFFS RECORDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. EXCLUDING THESE AMOUNTS, NET INCOME GROWTH WAS $38.1, DRIVEN BY HIGHER OPERATING RESULTS OF THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S NEW RATE DESIGN.  THE GAS MARKETING SEGMENT ALSO EXPERIENCED STRONG OPERATING RESULTS, DUE TO FAVORABLE FAIR VALUE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS, GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION, AND SOLID MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS WERE $213.8 ($4.20 PER DILUTED SHARE) FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, UP FROM $195.1 ($4.02 PER DILUTED SHARE) FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, REFLECTING A $21.9 INCREASE FOR GAS UTILITY AND A $0.7 NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS INCREASE EXPERIENCED BY GAS MARKETING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $3.9 HIGHER NET ECONOMIC LOSS IN OTHER. THESE FLUCTUATIONS ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  54  GAS UTILITY  GAS UTILITY NET INCOME INCREASED BY $65.4 AND NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS INCREASED $21.9 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. BOTH NET INCOME AND NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS WERE HIGHER IN THE CURRENT YEAR FROM THE RATE CASE REDESIGN AT SPIRE MISSOURI, AND FROM WEATHER PATTERNS THAT WERE FAVORABLE TO THE PRIOR YEAR. PRIOR-YEAR NET INCOME WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE $23.6 AFTER-TAX EXPENSE FOR MISSOURI RATE CASE WRITE-OFFS OFFSET BY ONE-TIME TAX BENEFITS RECORDED IN 2018 RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TCJA.  GAS MARKETING  THE GAS MARKETING SEGMENT REPORTED NET INCOME TOTALING $22.9 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, VERSUS NET INCOME OF $3.8 DURING THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, WITH THE CURRENT-YEAR PERIOD BENEFITTING FROM FAVORABLE FAIR VALUE MARK-TO-MARKET VALUATIONS. NET ECONOMIC EARNINGS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WERE $14.5, AN INCREASE OF $0.7 FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR AS THE BENEFITS OF GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION MORE THAN OFFSET THE RETURN OF MORE NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES.  OTHER  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, NET ECONOMIC LOSS FOR OTHER WAS $13.8, UP FROM $9.9 IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE HIGHER COSTS REFLECT HIGHER CORPORATE INTEREST COSTS AND A $7.4 LOSS FROM SPIRE STORAGE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED AFUDC INCOME FOR SPIRE STL PIPELINE.

THE GAS UTILITY INCREASE WAS DUE PRINCIPALLY TO THE MISSOURI RATE CASE RESET (NET OF TCJA GIVEBACK) AND WEATHER/VOLUMETRIC IMPACTS (NET OF WEATHER MITIGATION), OFFSET BY LOWER GAS COST RECOVERIES. THE GAS MARKETING INCREASE WAS DUE TO A COMBINATION OF HIGHER PRICING AND VOLUMES. SPIRE\u2019S CONTRIBUTION MARGIN INCREASED $51.8 COMPARED WITH THE SAME SIX-MONTH PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE GROWTH IN CONTRIBUTION MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT, UP $24.6, WITH THE MISSOURI UTILITIES UP $20.7 AND SPIRE ALABAMA UP $3.0, WITH REMAINING GROWTH FROM THE UTILITIES OF SPIRE ENERGYSOUTH. IN ADDITION, GAS MARKETING\u2019S CONTRIBUTION MARGIN WAS UP $25.8, REFLECTING A $23.6 YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPROVEMENT IN DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY AND FAIR VALUE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS, COMBINED WITH GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES WERE HIGHER IN THE GAS UTILITY SEGMENT, DUE TO HIGHER CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN BOTH THE MISSOURI UTILITIES AND SPIRE ALABAMA. GAS UTILITY O&M EXPENSES WERE LOWER IN THE CURRENT YEAR DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE MISSOURI RATE CASE WRITE-OFFS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THESE FLUCTUATIONS ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  GAS UTILITY  OPERATING REVENUES \u2013  GAS UTILITY OPERATING REVENUES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WERE $1,352.0, OR $19.2 HIGHER THAN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE IN GAS UTILITY OPERATING REVENUES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.  MISSOURI UTILITIES AND SPIRE ALABAMA \u2013 2018 RATE CASE RESETS (NET OF TCJA GIVEBACK)  $16.1  MISSOURI UTILITIES AND SPIRE ALABAMA \u2013 VOLUMETRIC USAGE (NET OF WEATHER MITIGATION)  15.2  MISSOURI UTILITIES AND SPIRE ALABAMA \u2013 HIGHER GROSS RECEIPTS TAXES  2.5  MISSOURI UTILITIES \u2013 CUSTOMER GROWTH  1.3  MISSOURI UTILITIES AND SPIRE ALABAMA \u2013 LOWER PGA/GSA COST RECOVERIES  (14.9  )  MISSOURI UTILITIES \u2013 OFF-SYSTEM SALES AND CAPACITY RELEASE  (1.1  )  ALL OTHER FACTORS  0.1  TOTAL VARIATION  $19.2  THE INCREASE IN REVENUES WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE OF $16.1 RELATING TO THE CHANGES TO THE SPIRE MISSOURI AND SPIRE ALABAMA RATE CASE RESETS (NET OF TCJA GIVEBACK), HIGHER WEATHER/VOLUMETRIC IMPACTS OF $15.2, INCREASES IN GROSS RECEIPT TAXES OF $2.5, AND $1.3 ATTRIBUTABLE TO CUSTOMER GROWTH.  THE POSITIVE REVENUE DRIVERS WERE OFFSET BY A $14.9 REDUCTION IN GAS COST RECOVERIES, AND A $1.1 REDUCTION IN SPIRE MISSOURI OFF-SYSTEM AND CAPACITY RELEASE.  CONTRIBUTION MARGIN  \u2013 GAS UTILITY CONTRIBUTION MARGIN WAS $624.2 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, A $24.6 INCREASE OVER THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.  MISSOURI UTILITIES AND SPIRE ALABAMA \u2013 2018 RATE CASE RESETS (NET OF TCJA GIVEBACK)  $16.1  MISSOURI UTILITIES AND SPIRE ALABAMA \u2013 VOLUMETRIC USAGE (NET OF WEATHER MITIGATION)  4.6  MISSOURI UTILITIES \u2013 OFF-SYSTEM SALES AND CAPACITY RELEASE  1.5  MISSOURI UTILITIES \u2013 CUSTOMER GROWTH  1.3  ALL OTHER FACTORS  1.1  TOTAL VARIATION  $24.6  THE CONTRIBUTION MARGIN INCREASE RESULTED FROM THE NEW MISSOURI RATE DESIGN AND COLDER WEATHER IN THE CURRENT YEAR (NET OF WEATHER MITIGATION), COMBINED WITH THE IMPACTS FROM SPIRE ALABAMA\u2019S RATE RESET AND THE MISSOURI UTILITIES\u2019 OFF-SYSTEM SALES AND CAPACITY RELEASE.  56  OPERATING EXPENSES  \u2013 GAS UTILITY O&M EXPENSES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019,  DECREASED  $21.  5 FROM LAST YEAR  . REMOVING LAST YEAR\u2019S  $38.4 OF  MISSOURI RATE CASE WRITE-OFFS  ,  OFFSET BY $9.  9  NET YEAR-OVER-YEAR IN  CREASE DUE TO THE MIX OF SERVICE AND NON-SERVICE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS COSTS NOW RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE  ,  O&M INCREASED $7.0.  EXCLUDING THE  IMPACT  OF  $8.0  HIGHER  EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY COSTS  THAT RESULTED FROM THE 2018 MISSO  URI RATE CASE  ,  DISCRETIONARY O&M EXPENDITURES IN THE CURRENT YEAR ARE RUNNING SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, INCREASED $6.7  FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR AS A RESULT OF HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT OVER THE PAST YEAR, WITH $5.0  ATTRIBUTABLE TO SPIRE MISSOURI AND $1.  4  ATTRIBUTABLE TO SPIRE ALABAMA.  GAS MARKETING  OPERATING REVENUES  \u2013 GAS MARKETING OPERATING REVENUES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, INCREASED $10.4 FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO HIGHER TOTAL VOLUMES IN CONJUNCTION WITH HIGHER GENERAL PRICING LEVELS, ALONG WITH THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN TRADING ACTIVITIES. OVERALL COMMODITY PRICING IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS $0.448/MMBTU HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR.  CONTRIBUTION MARGIN  \u2013 GAS MARKETING CONTRIBUTION MARGIN DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, INCREASED $25.8 FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, BENEFITING FROM A NET $23.6 YEAR-OVER-YEAR SWING IN DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY AND MARK-TO-MARKET VALUATIONS. EXCLUDING THAT FACTOR, THE SOLID PERFORMANCE REFLECTS A RETURN TO MORE NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION THAT CREATED ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO OPTIMIZE THE SEGMENT\u2019S SUPPLY, TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE PORTFOLIO.  INTEREST CHARGES  CONSOLIDATED INTEREST CHARGES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WERE $3.7 HIGHER THAN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NET LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCES AND HIGHER RATES AND LEVELS OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, AVERAGE SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS WERE $598.3 AND $514.2, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATES ON THESE BORROWINGS WERE 2.8% AND 1.8%, RESPECTIVELY.  INCOME TAXES  CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, INCREASED $62.3 VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR. OF THIS VARIANCE, $54.0 IS THE RESULT OF THE REVALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET THAT WAS RECORDED DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TCJA IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE REMAINING VARIANCE IS THE RESULT OF THE HIGHER PRE-TAX BOOK INCOME IN THE CURRENT YEAR, OFFSET IN PART BY THE AMORTIZATION OF EXCESS DEFERRED TAXES.  SPIRE MISSOURI  SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  OPERATING INCOME [GAAP]  $173.8  $136.6  OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES  133.8  154.1  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  55.0  50.0  TAXES, OTHER THAN INCOME TAXES  70.0  67.4  LESS: GROSS RECEIPTS TAX EXPENSE  (50.6  )  (46.8  )  CONTRIBUTION MARGIN [NON-GAAP]  382.0  361.3  NATURAL AND PROPANE GAS COSTS  537.2  517.4  GROSS RECEIPTS TAX EXPENSE  50.6  46.8  OPERATING REVENUES  $969.8  $925.5  NET INCOME  $131.2  $127.8  57  OPERATING REVENUES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, INCREASED $44.3  FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO A $15.2  INCREASE ATTRIBUTABLE TO  THE NEW RATE DESIGN  (NET OF TCJA GIVEBACK)  ,  A  $19.1  INCREASE  IN  VOLUMETRIC IMPACTS  (NET OF WEATHER MITIGATION) RELATING TO  COLDER  WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE CURRENT YEAR  ,  AND  $6.  0  H  IGHER  WHOLESALE GAS COSTS PASSED ON TO CUSTOMERS.  CONTRIBUTION MARGIN INCREASED $2  0.7  PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $15.2  INCREASE ATTRIBUTABLE TO  THE NEW RATE DESIGN  (NET OF TCJA GIVEBACK)  , $2.5 INCREASE DUE TO  HIGHER VOLUMES AND WEATHER,  A  $1.5  INCREASE  DUE TO OFF-SYSTEM SALES AND CAPACITY RELIEF  AND  A  $1.3  INCREASE  DUE TO  CUSTOMER GROWTH.  O&M EXPENSES DURING THE SIX MONTH  S ENDED MARCH 31, 2019,  DE  CREASED $20.3  FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. EXCLUDING THE $38.4 OF  MISSOURI RATE CASE WRITE-OFFS IN THE PRIOR YEAR,  OFFSET BY $9.  8  NET  YEAR-OVER-YEAR  INCREASE DUE TO THE MIX OF SERVICE AND NON-SERVICE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS COS  TS NOW RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE  , O&M EXPENSES WERE $8.3  HIGHER  IN THE CURRENT YEAR VERSUS THE PRIOR  -  YEAR PERIOD. THIS  IN  CREASE IS THE RESULT OF  HIGHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY COSTS  (RECOVERED IN RATES) RESULTING FROM THE 2018 RA  TE CASE, PARTLY OFFSET BY  LOWER  DISCRETIONARY EXPENSE  S.  DEPRECIATION INCREASED BY $5.0  AS A RESULT OF CONTINUING INCREASES IN THE LEVELS OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT.  TEMPERATURES IN SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S SERVICE AREAS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WERE 9% COLDER THAN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR AND 10% COLDER THAN NORMAL. THE MISSOURI UTILITIES\u2019 TOTAL SYSTEM THERMS SOLD AND TRANSPORTED WERE 1,418.1 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED WITH 1,312.9 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. TOTAL OFF-SYSTEM THERMS SOLD AND TRANSPORTED WERE 34.8 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED WITH 67.6 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. REVENUES AND MARGINS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY COLDER WEATHER DUE TO WEATHER MITIGATION IN OUR RATE DESIGN.

THE CHANGE WAS PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY A $20.9 DECREASE IN GAS COST RECOVERIES VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR, A $3.9 DECREASE RELATED TO GAS USAGE, AND $1.3 IN LOWER GROSS RECEIPTS TAX THAT WAS ONLY OFFSET PARTLY BY A $2.4 RSE ADJUSTMENT. CONTRIBUTION MARGIN INCREASED $3.0, PRINCIPALLY AS A RESULT OF THE 2019 RSE RATE RESET. O&M EXPENSES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, DECREASED $0.2 FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DECREASES IN EMPLOYEE-RELATED AND BAD DEBT EXPENSES. NET INCOME VARIANCE VERSUS PRIOR YEAR ALSO INCLUDES THE $59.2 NET TAX RATE CHANGE AND DEFERRED TAX REVALUATION IMPACT RESULTING FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TCJA IN 2018.  TEMPERATURES IN SPIRE ALABAMA\u2019S SERVICE AREA DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WERE 4% WARMER THAN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR AND 7% WARMER THAN NORMAL.

GAAP REQUIRES THAT WE MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DESCRIBED IN ITEM 7 OF THE COMPANY\u2019S, SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S, AND SPIRE ALABAMA\u2019S COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, AND INCLUDE REGULATORY ACCOUNTING, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, AND INCOME TAXES. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  FOR DISCUSSION OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE  NOTE 1  OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS FORM 10-Q AS WELL AS NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S, SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S, AND SPIRE ALABAMA\u2019S COMBINED ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

CASH  FLOWS  THE COMPANY\u2019S SHORT-TERM BORROWING REQUIREMENTS TYPICALLY PEAK DURING COLDER MONTHS WHEN THE UTILITIES BORROW MONEY TO COVER THE LAG BETWEEN WHEN THEY PURCHASE NATURAL GAS AND WHEN THEIR CUSTOMERS PAY FOR THAT GAS. CHANGES IN THE WHOLESALE COST OF NATURAL GAS (INCLUDING CASH PAYMENTS FOR MARGIN DEPOSITS ASSOCIATED WITH SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S USE OF NATURAL GAS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS), VARIATIONS IN THE TIMING OF COLLECTIONS OF GAS COST UNDER THE UTILITIES\u2019 PGA CLAUSES AND GSA RIDERS, THE SEASONALITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES, AND THE UTILIZATION OF STORAGE GAS INVENTORIES CAUSE SHORT-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS TO VARY DURING THE YEAR AND FROM YEAR TO YEAR, AND MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  SIX MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  CASH FLOW SUMMARY  2019  2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $297.5  $309.6  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (386.6  )  (233.3  )  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  78.8  (65.9  )  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $12.1 FROM THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018. THE CHANGE WAS DUE PRINCIPALLY TO THE TIMING OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND FLUCTUATIONS IN WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $153.3 MORE THAN FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, DRIVEN BY A $161.0 INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER ACQUISITION ACTIVITY. THE HIGHER CAPITAL SPENDING IN THE CURRENT YEAR IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S CAPITAL EXPENDITURE EXPECTATIONS AND REFLECTS INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES AT THE UTILITIES, SUPPORT OF CUSTOMER GROWTH, NEW BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES, AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT OF SPIRE STL PIPELINE AND SPIRE STORAGE. TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR 2019 ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $740.  59  LASTLY, FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH  31  , 201  9  , NET CASH  PROVIDED BY  FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $78.8, VERSUS NET CASH USED OF $65.9  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH  31  , 201  8  . THIS CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTS  ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $1  9  0.0 THIS YEAR  VERSUS $75  .0 IN THE PRIOR YEAR,  COMBINED WITH $34.9 LOWER SHORT  -  AND LONG  -T  ERM BORROWING RE  PA  YMENTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR, PARTLY OFFSET  WITH AN INCREASE IN DIVIDENDS PAID.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY\u2019S, SPIRE MISSOURI\u2019S AND SPIRE ALABAMA\u2019S ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, INCLUDING THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE FINANCING COSTS, MAY DEPEND ON THE CREDIT RATING OF THE ENTITY THAT IS ACCESSING THE CAPITAL MARKETS. OUR DEBT IS RATED BY TWO RATING AGENCIES: STANDARD & POOR\u2019S CORPORATION (\u201cS&P\u201d) AND MOODY\u2019S INVESTORS SERVICE (\u201cMOODY\u2019S\u201d).

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS INTENDED TO HELP THE READER UNDERSTAND THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF NEW RESIDENTIAL. THE FOLLOWING SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO INCLUDED HEREIN, AND WITH \u201cRISK FACTORS.\u201d  GENERAL  NEW RESIDENTIAL IS A PUBLICLY TRADED REIT PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON OPPORTUNISTICALLY INVESTING IN, AND ACTIVELY MANAGING, INVESTMENTS RELATED TO RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE. WE PRIMARILY TARGET INVESTMENTS IN MORTGAGE SERVICING RELATED ASSETS AND RELATED OPPORTUNISTIC INVESTMENTS. WE ARE EXTERNALLY MANAGED BY AN AFFILIATE OF FORTRESS PURSUANT TO THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. OUR GOAL IS TO DRIVE STRONG RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR INVESTMENTS, AND OUR INVESTMENT GUIDELINES ARE PURPOSEFULLY BROAD TO ENABLE US TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN A WIDE ARRAY OF ASSETS IN DIVERSE MARKETS, INCLUDING NON-REAL ESTATE RELATED ASSETS SUCH AS CONSUMER LOANS. WE GENERALLY TARGET ASSETS THAT GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CURRENT CASH FLOWS AND/OR HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR MEANINGFUL CAPITAL APPRECIATION.  OUR PORTFOLIO IS CURRENTLY COMPOSED OF MORTGAGE SERVICING RELATED ASSETS, NON-AGENCY RMBS (AND ASSOCIATED CALL RIGHTS), RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND OTHER OPPORTUNISTIC INVESTMENTS. OUR ASSET ALLOCATION AND TARGET ASSETS MAY CHANGE OVER TIME, DEPENDING ON OUR INVESTMENT DECISIONS IN LIGHT OF PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS. THE ASSETS IN OUR PORTFOLIO ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW UNDER \u201c\u2014OUR PORTFOLIO.\u201d  MARKET CONSIDERATIONS  DEVELOPMENTS IN THE U.S. HOUSING MARKET  AS OF THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  , THE TOP 100 MORTGAGE SERVICERS SERVICED OVER 99% OF THE $10.9 TRILLION ONE-TO-FOUR FAMILY MORTGAGE DEBT OUTSTANDING, ACCORDING TO INSIDE MORTGAGE FINANCE. FURTHERMORE, ACCORDING TO INSIDE MORTGAGE FINANCE, AS OF THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  , APPROXIMATELY 66% OF SUCH OUTSTANDING MORTGAGE DEBT WAS SERVICED BY THE TOP 25 MORTGAGE SERVICERS, OF WHICH 15 ARE NON-BANKS. GIVEN CURRENT MARKET DYNAMICS AND AN OVERALL COMPETITIVE SERVICING ENVIRONMENT, WE MAY EXPECT ADDITIONAL MARKET CONSOLIDATION AMONG NON-BANK SERVICERS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THAT NON-BANK SERVICERS WHO ARE CONSTRAINED BY CAPITAL LIMITATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO SELL MSRS, EXCESS MSRS AND OTHER SERVICING ASSETS. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE ADDITIONAL MSR SALES WILL BE LIKELY FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. THESE FACTORS HAVE RESULTED IN INCREASED OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO ACQUIRE INTERESTS IN MSRS AND TO PROVIDE CAPITAL TO NON-BANK SERVICERS. IN ADDITION, APPROXIMATELY $1.6 TRILLION OF NEW LOANS WERE ORIGINATED IN 2018 AND ANOTHER $1.6 TRILLION ARE FORECASTED FOR 2019, ACCORDING TO THE MORTGAGE BANKERS ASSOCIATION. WE BELIEVE THIS CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENTER INTO \u201cFLOW ARRANGEMENTS,\u201d WHEREBY LOAN ORIGINATORS OR SERVICERS AGREE TO SELL MSRS OR EXCESS MSRS ON NEWLY ORIGINATED LOANS ON A RECURRING BASIS (OFTEN MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY). RECENTLY, STRONG DEMAND FOR MORTGAGE ASSETS IN GENERAL HAS LED TO TIGHTER SPREADS AND LOWER REQUIRED RATES OF RETURN. THIS, IN TURN, CREATES A REACH FOR YIELD AND INCREASED DIFFICULTY IN SOURCING ACCRETIVE INVESTMENTS IN THE CURRENT INVESTMENT LANDSCAPE. THESE MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE DRIVEN PRICES HIGHER, THEREBY ALSO INCREASING THE VALUE OF CERTAIN OF OUR EXISTING INVESTMENTS.  INTEREST RATES AND PREPAYMENT RATES  AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN \u201cQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK,\u201d INCREASING INTEREST RATES ARE GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH DECLINING PREPAYMENT RATES FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS SINCE THEY INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING FOR HOMEOWNERS. DECLINING PREPAYMENT RATES, IN TURN, WOULD GENERALLY BE EXPECTED TO INCREASE THE VALUE OF OUR INTERESTS IN EXCESS MSRS, MSRS AND SERVICER ADVANCE INVESTMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO A PORTION OF THE RELATED MSRS, BECAUSE THE DURATION OF THE CASH FLOWS WE ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE BECOMES EXTENDED WITH NO REDUCTION IN CURRENT CASH FLOWS. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WILL ALSO DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR COSTS OF BORROWING EITHER IMMEDIATELY (FLOATING RATE DEBT) OR UPON REFINANCING (FIXED RATE DEBT) AND MAY ALSO BE ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN CREDIT SPREADS AND/OR THE DISCOUNT RATES USED IN VALUING INVESTMENTS. DECLINING PREPAYMENT RATES HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF INVESTMENTS PURCHASED AT A SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNT SINCE THE RECOVERY OF THAT DISCOUNT IS DELAYED.  IN THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  , THE FEDERAL RESERVE INDICATED THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE PATIENT WITH REGARDS TO FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TARGET RANGE FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AND CURRENT INTEREST RATES GENERALLY DECREASED. WITH RESPECT TO OUR NON-AGENCY RMBS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY PURCHASED AT A SIGNIFICANT DISCOUNT TO PAR, MARKET INTEREST RATES DECREASED AND MARKET CREDIT SPREADS INCREASED, WITH THE NET RESULT BEING A DECREASE IN VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS DURING THE QUARTER.  THE VALUE OF OUR MSRS AND EXCESS MSRS IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, AS DESCRIBED IN \u201cQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\u201d AND IN \u201cRISK FACTORS.\u201d IN THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  , THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN EXCESS MSRS AND OUR SHARE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE EXCESS MSRS HELD THROUGH EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES  INCREASED  BY APPROXIMATELY  $5.0 MILLION  65  IN THE AGGREGATE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A DECREASE IN DISCOUNT RATES. IN ADDITION, A DECREASE IN COSTS OF SUBSERVICING AND AN INCREASE IN ANCILLARY INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FASTER PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, CAUSED THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR MSRS, INCLUDING MSR FINANCING RECEIVABLES, TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY  $22.3 MILLION  DURING THE PERIOD.  CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES DID NOT HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON THE NET INTEREST SPREAD OF OUR AGENCY AND NON-AGENCY RMBS PORTFOLIOS. OUR RMBS ARE PRIMARILY FLOATING RATE OR HYBRID (I.E., FIXED TO FLOATING RATE) SECURITIES, WHICH WE GENERALLY FINANCE WITH FLOATING RATE DEBT, OR ARE ECONOMICALLY HEDGED WITH RESPECT TO INTEREST RATES. THEREFORE, WHILE RISING INTEREST RATES WILL GENERALLY RESULT IN A HIGHER COST OF FINANCING, THEY WILL ALSO RESULT IN A HIGHER COUPON PAYABLE ON THE SECURITIES. THE NET INTEREST SPREAD ON OUR AGENCY RMBS PORTFOLIO AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  0.95%  , COMPARED TO  1.04%  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE SPREAD CHANGED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOWER YIELDS FROM NEW SECURITIES PURCHASED DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  AND INCREASED FUNDING COSTS. THE NET INTEREST SPREAD ON OUR NON-AGENCY RMBS PORTFOLIO AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  1.95%  , COMPARED TO  2.09%  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018. THIS SPREAD CHANGED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED FUNDING COSTS.  GENERAL U.S. ECONOMY AND UNEMPLOYMENT  DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  , THE U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE CONTINUED TO DECLINE, SIGNALING A GENERAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE U.S. ECONOMY. IN OUR VIEW, AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE ECONOMY, AS DEMONSTRATED THROUGH SUCH MEASURE, GENERALLY IMPROVES THE VALUE OF HOUSING AND THE ABILITY OF BORROWERS TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON THEIR LOANS, THEREBY DECREASING DELINQUENCIES AND DEFAULTS ON RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, CONSUMER LOANS AND RMBS. THIS RELATIONSHIP GENERALLY HELD TRUE, HOWEVER, THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 HAS SHOWN CERTAIN INDICATIONS THAT THE RATE OF HOME PRICE INCREASES ACROSS THE U.S. HAS SLOWED.  THE CASE SHILLER U.S. NATIONAL HOME PRICE INDEX REPORTED A 4.3% ANNUAL GAIN IN JANUARY 2019, DOWN FROM 4.6% IN DECEMBER 2018. IN ADDITION, ACCORDING TO CORELOGIC, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF MORTGAGED RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES WITH NEGATIVE EQUITY STOOD AT 2.2 MILLION, OR 4.2%, AS OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, UP FROM THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018; HOWEVER, ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS, THE NUMBER OF MORTGAGED PROPERTIES IN NEGATIVE EQUITY FELL 14.0%. WHILE POTENTIALLY SLOWING, THIS TREND CONTINUES TO HELP SUPPORT THE VALUES OF OUR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, CONSUMER LOANS AND RMBS.  CREDIT SPREADS  CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE VALUE OF YIELD DRIVEN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (E.G., RMBS AND LOAN PORTFOLIOS), TIGHTENED DURING THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  . WHILE A USEFUL MARKET PROXY, CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OR DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO MORTGAGE CREDIT SPREADS. COLLATERAL PERFORMANCE, MARKET LIQUIDITY, MORTGAGE CREDIT SPREADS AND OTHER FACTORS RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO CERTAIN INVESTMENTS WITHIN OUR MORTGAGE SECURITIES AND LOAN PORTFOLIO CAUSED AN INCREASE TO THE VALUE OF THE PORTION OF THIS PORTFOLIO THAT WAS OWNED FOR THE ENTIRE QUARTER.  FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THESE AND OTHER MARKET FACTORS WHICH IMPACT OUR PORTFOLIO, SEE ITEM 3. \u201cQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\u201d  OUR MANAGER  ON DECEMBER 27, 2017, SOFTBANK GROUP CORP.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN INCOME OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES INCREASED BY  $0.2 MILLION  PRIMARILY DUE TO (I) A $1.1 MILLION INCREASE IN OTHER\u2019S INTEREST IN THE NET INCOME OF THE BUYER AS A RESULT OF A CHANGE FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENTS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE BUYER\u2019S ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET DECREASE IN INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON THE BUYER\u2019S LEVERED ASSETS, DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY (II) A $1.3 MILLION DECREASE FROM A NET DECREASE IN INCOME FROM THE CONSUMER LOAN COMPANIES, WHICH ARE 46.5% OWNED BY THIRD PARTIES.  OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  SEE \u201c\u2014ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\u201d BELOW.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  LIQUIDITY IS A MEASUREMENT OF OUR ABILITY TO MEET POTENTIAL CASH REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING ONGOING COMMITMENTS TO REPAY BORROWINGS, FUND AND MAINTAIN INVESTMENTS, AND OTHER GENERAL BUSINESS NEEDS. ADDITIONALLY, TO MAINTAIN OUR STATUS AS A REIT UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, WE MUST DISTRIBUTE ANNUALLY AT LEAST 90% OF OUR REIT TAXABLE INCOME. WE NOTE THAT A PORTION OF THIS REQUIREMENT MAY BE ABLE TO BE MET IN FUTURE YEARS THROUGH STOCK DIVIDENDS, RATHER THAN CASH, SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS BASED ON THE VALUE OF OUR STOCK.  82  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR LIQUIDITY GENERALLY CONSIST OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES (PRIMARILY INCOME FROM OUR INVESTMENTS IN EXCESS MSRS, MSRS, SERVICER ADVANCE INVESTMENTS, RMBS AND LOANS), SALES OF AND REPAYMENTS FROM OUR INVESTMENTS, POTENTIAL DEBT FINANCING SOURCES, INCLUDING SECURITIZATIONS, AND THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, WHEN FEASIBLE AND APPROPRIATE. OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE FUNDS GENERATED BY THE MSRS HELD IN OUR SERVICER SUBSIDIARIES, NRM AND NEWREZ, IS SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS REGARDING NRM\u2019S AND NEWREZ\u2019S LIQUIDITY. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY  $243.5 MILLION  OF OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS HELD AT NRM AND NEWREZ, OF WHICH  $105.5 MILLION  WAS IN EXCESS OF REGULATORY LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND AVAILABLE FOR DEPLOYMENT. OUR PRIMARY USES OF FUNDS ARE THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST, MANAGEMENT FEES, INCENTIVE COMPENSATION, SERVICING AND SUBSERVICING EXPENSES, OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS (INCLUDING MARGINS) AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES, AND THE REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS AND HEDGE OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS DIVIDENDS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE OTHER SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, SUCH AS SALES OF AND REPAYMENTS FROM OUR INVESTMENTS, POTENTIAL DEBT FINANCING SOURCES AND THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH OR ACHIEVE INVESTMENT RESULTS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO MAKE A SPECIFIED LEVEL OF CASH DISTRIBUTIONS OR YEAR-TO-YEAR INCREASES IN CASH DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE FUTURE. WE HAVE ALSO COMMITTED TO PURCHASE CERTAIN FUTURE SERVICER ADVANCES. CURRENTLY, WE EXPECT THAT NET RECOVERIES OF SERVICER ADVANCES WILL EXCEED NET FUNDINGS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT OF A SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, NET FUNDINGS COULD EXCEED NET RECOVERIES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND COULD ALSO RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES, PRIMARILY INTEREST EXPENSE ON ANY RELATED FINANCINGS OF INCREMENTAL ADVANCES.  CURRENTLY, OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF FINANCING ARE NOTES AND BONDS PAYABLE AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, ALTHOUGH WE HAVE IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE ALSO PURSUE ONE OR MORE OTHER SOURCES OF FINANCING SUCH AS SECURITIZATIONS AND OTHER SECURED AND UNSECURED FORMS OF BORROWING. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD OUTSTANDING REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH AN AGGREGATE FACE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY  $18.4 BILLION  TO FINANCE OUR INVESTMENTS. THE FINANCING OF OUR ENTIRE RMBS PORTFOLIO, WHICH GENERALLY HAS 30 TO 90 DAY TERMS, IS SUBJECT TO MARGIN CALLS. UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, WE SELL A SECURITY TO A COUNTERPARTY AND CONCURRENTLY AGREE TO REPURCHASE THE SAME SECURITY AT A LATER DATE FOR A HIGHER SPECIFIED PRICE. THE SALE PRICE REPRESENTS FINANCING PROCEEDS AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SALE AND REPURCHASE PRICES REPRESENTS INTEREST ON THE FINANCING. THE PRICE AT WHICH THE SECURITY IS SOLD GENERALLY REPRESENTS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITY LESS A DISCOUNT OR \u201cHAIRCUT,\u201d WHICH CAN RANGE BROADLY, FOR EXAMPLE FROM  3%  -  5%  FOR AGENCY RMBS,  4%  -  60%  FOR NON-AGENCY RMBS, AND  2%  -  50%  FOR RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS. DURING THE TERM OF THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT, THE COUNTERPARTY HOLDS THE SECURITY AS COLLATERAL. IF THE AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO MARGIN CALLS, THE COUNTERPARTY MONITORS AND CALCULATES WHAT IT ESTIMATES TO BE THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL DURING THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT. IF THIS VALUE DECLINES BY MORE THAN A DE MINIMIS THRESHOLD, THE COUNTERPARTY COULD REQUIRE US TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL (OR \u201cMARGIN\u201d) IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE INITIAL HAIRCUT ON THE COLLATERAL. THIS MARGIN IS TYPICALLY REQUIRED TO BE POSTED IN THE FORM OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. FURTHERMORE, WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, BE A PARTY TO DERIVATIVE AGREEMENTS OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO MARGIN CALLS BASED ON THE VALUE OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS. IN ADDITION,  $2.5 BILLION  FACE AMOUNT OF OUR MSR AND EXCESS MSR FINANCING IS SUBJECT TO MANDATORY MONTHLY REPAYMENT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE EXCEEDS THE MARKET VALUE (AS DEFINED IN THE RELATED AGREEMENT) OF THE FINANCED ASSET MULTIPLIED BY THE CONTRACTUAL MAXIMUM LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIO. WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE CASH RESERVES AND OTHER SOURCES OF AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY TO MEET ANY MARGIN CALLS OR RELATED REQUIREMENTS RESULTING FROM DECREASES IN VALUE RELATED TO A REASONABLY POSSIBLE (IN OUR OPINION) CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES.  OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN BORROWINGS AND TO RAISE FUTURE EQUITY CAPITAL IS DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS BORROWINGS AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS ON ATTRACTIVE TERMS. WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR MARKET CONDITIONS FOR FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES AND AT ANY GIVEN TIME MAY BE ENTERING OR PURSUING ONE OR MORE OF THE TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE. OUR MANAGER\u2019S SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS EXTENSIVE LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH INVESTMENT BANKS, BROKERAGE FIRMS AND COMMERCIAL BANKS, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO SOURCE AND FINANCE ASSET ACQUISITIONS ON ATTRACTIVE TERMS AND ACCESS BORROWINGS AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS AT ATTRACTIVE LEVELS.  WITH RESPECT TO THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WE EXPECT THAT OUR CASH ON HAND COMBINED WITH OUR CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO ROLL OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND SERVICER ADVANCE FINANCINGS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR ANTICIPATED LIQUIDITY NEEDS WITH RESPECT TO OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING RELATED FINANCINGS, POTENTIAL MARGIN CALLS AND OPERATING EXPENSES. OUR ABILITY TO ROLL OVER SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS IS CRITICAL TO OUR LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK. WHILE IT IS INHERENTLY MORE DIFFICULT TO FORECAST BEYOND THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS THROUGH OUR CASH ON HAND AND, IF NEEDED, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS, PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCINGS, PROCEEDS FROM EQUITY OFFERINGS AND THE LIQUIDATION OR REFINANCING OF OUR ASSETS.  THESE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EXPECTATIONS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING AND SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF UNCERTAINTIES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED UNDER \u201c\u2014MARKET CONSIDERATIONS\u201d AS WELL AS \u201cRISK FACTORS.\u201d IF OUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT OUR LIQUIDITY PROVE TO BE INCORRECT, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO A SHORTFALL IN LIQUIDITY IN THE FUTURE, AND SUCH A SHORTFALL MAY OCCUR RAPIDLY AND WITH LITTLE OR NO NOTICE, WHICH COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ADDRESS THE SHORTFALL ON A TIMELY BASIS AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.  OUR CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS DIFFERS FROM OUR NET INCOME DUE TO THESE PRIMARY FACTORS: (I) THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN (A) ACCRETION AND AMORTIZATION AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RECORDED WITH RESPECT TO OUR INVESTMENTS AND (B) CASH RECEIVED THEREFROM,  83  (II) UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON OUR DERIVATIVES, AND RECORDED IMPAIRMENTS, IF ANY, (III) DEFERRED TAXES, AND (IV) PRINCIPAL CASH FLOWS RELATED TO HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS, WHICH ARE CHARACTERIZED AS OPERATING CASH FLOWS UNDER GAAP.  IN ADDITION TO THE INFORMATION REFERENCED ABOVE, THE FOLLOWING FACTORS COULD AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY, ACCESS TO CAPITAL RESOURCES AND OUR CAPITAL OBLIGATIONS. AS SUCH, IF THEIR OUTCOMES DO NOT FALL WITHIN OUR EXPECTATIONS, CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY.  \u2022  ACCESS TO FINANCING FROM COUNTERPARTIES  \u2013 DECISIONS BY INVESTORS, COUNTERPARTIES AND LENDERS TO ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH US WILL DEPEND UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, SUCH AS OUR HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF OUR CURRENT CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, INDUSTRY AND MARKET TRENDS, THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL AND OUR INVESTORS\u2019, COUNTERPARTIES\u2019 AND LENDERS\u2019 POLICIES AND RATES APPLICABLE THERETO, AND THE RELATIVE ATTRACTIVENESS OF ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT OR LENDING OPPORTUNITIES. OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO FINANCE CERTAIN OF OUR INVESTMENTS AT RATES THAT PROVIDE A POSITIVE NET SPREAD.  \u2022  IMPACT OF EXPECTED REPAYMENT OR FORECASTED SALE ON CASH FLOWS  \u2013 THE TIMING OF AND PROCEEDS FROM THE REPAYMENT OR SALE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN EXPECTED OR MAY NOT OCCUR AS EXPECTED. PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF ASSETS ARE UNPREDICTABLE AND MAY VARY MATERIALLY FROM THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AND THEIR CARRYING VALUE. FURTHER, THE AVAILABILITY OF INVESTMENTS THAT PROVIDE SIMILAR RETURNS TO THOSE REPAID OR SOLD INVESTMENTS IS UNPREDICTABLE AND RETURNS ON NEW INVESTMENTS MAY VARY MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ON EXISTING INVESTMENTS.

THE PRIMARY CAUSES OF MARK TO MARKET CHANGES ARE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND CREDIT SPREADS. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECORDED UNREALIZED GAINS ON OUR REAL ESTATE SECURITIES PRIMARILY CAUSED BY PERFORMANCE, LIQUIDITY AND OTHER FACTORS RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, COUPLED WITH A NET TIGHTENING OF MORTGAGE CREDIT SPREADS. WE RECORDED OTTI CHARGES OF  $7.5 MILLION  WITH RESPECT TO REAL ESTATE SECURITIES AND REALIZED GAINS OF  $65.2 MILLION  ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE SECURITIES.  SEE \u201c\u2014MARKET CONSIDERATIONS\u201d ABOVE FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF RECENT TRENDS AND EVENTS AFFECTING OUR UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, AS WELL AS OUR LIQUIDITY.  COMMON DIVIDENDS  WE ARE ORGANIZED AND INTEND TO CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS TO QUALIFY AS A REIT FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. WE INTEND TO MAKE REGULAR QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK. U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAW GENERALLY REQUIRES THAT A REIT DISTRIBUTE ANNUALLY AT LEAST 90% OF ITS REIT TAXABLE INCOME, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DEDUCTION FOR DIVIDENDS PAID AND EXCLUDING NET CAPITAL GAINS, AND THAT IT PAY TAX AT REGULAR CORPORATE RATES TO THE EXTENT THAT IT ANNUALLY DISTRIBUTES LESS THAN 100% OF ITS TAXABLE INCOME. WE INTEND TO MAKE REGULAR QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK OUT OF ASSETS LEGALLY AVAILABLE FOR THIS PURPOSE, IF AND TO THE EXTENT AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. BEFORE WE PAY ANY DIVIDEND, WHETHER FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES OR OTHERWISE, WE MUST FIRST MEET BOTH OUR OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND DEBT SERVICE ON OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER DEBT PAYABLE. IF OUR CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION IS LESS THAN OUR TAXABLE INCOME, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO SELL ASSETS OR RAISE CAPITAL TO MAKE CASH DISTRIBUTIONS OR WE MAY MAKE A PORTION OF THE REQUIRED DISTRIBUTION IN THE FORM OF A TAXABLE STOCK DISTRIBUTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF DEBT SECURITIES.  WE MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING AN ESTIMATE OF TAXABLE EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE. DIVIDENDS DISTRIBUTED AND TAXABLE AND GAAP EARNINGS WILL TYPICALLY DIFFER DUE TO ITEMS SUCH AS FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS, DIFFERENCES IN PREMIUM AMORTIZATION AND DISCOUNT ACCRETION, OTHER DIFFERENCES IN METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, NON-DEDUCTIBLE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, TAXABLE INCOME ARISING FROM CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND INVESTMENTS HELD IN TRSS. OUR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PER SHARE MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT THAN OUR QUARTERLY TAXABLE EARNINGS AND GAAP EARNINGS PER SHARE.  COMMON DIVIDENDS DECLARED FOR THE PERIOD ENDED  PAID/PAYABLE  AMOUNT PER SHARE  JUNE 30, 2018  JULY 2018  $0.50  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  OCTOBER 2018  $0.50  DECEMBER 31, 2018  JANUARY 2019  $0.50  MARCH 31, 2019  APRIL 2019  $0.50  CASH FLOW  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY  $814.1 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  . OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF PURCHASED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, HELD-FOR-SALE OF  $2.8 BILLION  , SERVICING FEES RECEIVED OF  $195.1 MILLION  , NET FUNDING OF SERVICER ADVANCES RECEIVABLE OF  $241.5 MILLION  , NET INTEREST INCOME RECEIVED OF  $277.2 MILLION  , AND DISTRIBUTIONS OF EARNINGS FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES OF  $3.4 MILLION  . OPERATING CASH OUTFLOWS PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF PURCHASES OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS, HELD-FOR-SALE OF  $1.3 BILLION  , ORIGINATIONS OF  $2.0 BILLION  , INCENTIVE  88  COMPENSATION AND MANAGEMENT FEES PAID TO THE MANAGER OF  $106.3 MILLION  , INCOME TAXES PAID OF  $0.1 MILLION  , SUBSERVICING FEES PAID OF  $107.8 MILLION  AND OTHER OUTFLOWS OF APPROXIMATELY  $266.3 MILLION  INCLUDING GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND LOAN SERVICING FEES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES WERE  $(2.8) BILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  . INVESTING ACTIVITIES CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF THE ACQUISITION OF MSRS, REAL ESTATE SECURITIES, AND THE FUNDING OF SERVICER ADVANCES, NET OF PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS FROM SERVICER ADVANCE INVESTMENTS, MSRS, REAL ESTATE SECURITIES AND LOANS AS WELL AS PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF REAL ESTATE SECURITIES, LOANS AND REO, AND DERIVATIVE CASH FLOWS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES WERE APPROXIMATELY  $3.1 BILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  . FINANCING ACTIVITIES CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF BORROWINGS NET OF REPAYMENTS UNDER DEBT OBLIGATIONS, EQUITY OFFERINGS, CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS NET OF DISTRIBUTIONS FROM NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN THE EQUITY OF CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, AND PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.  INTEREST RATE, CREDIT AND SPREAD RISK  WE ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE, CREDIT AND SPREAD RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR INVESTMENTS. THESE RISKS ARE FURTHER DESCRIBED IN \u201cQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\u201d  89  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE MATERIAL OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS RELATED TO OUR NON-CONSOLIDATED SECURITIZATIONS OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS TREATED AS SALES IN WHICH WE RETAINED CERTAIN INTERESTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE OFF-BALANCE SHEET STRUCTURES PRESENTED THE MOST EFFICIENT AND LEAST EXPENSIVE FORM OF FINANCING FOR THESE ASSETS AT THE TIME THEY WERE ENTERED AND REPRESENTED THE MOST COMMON MARKET-ACCEPTED METHOD FOR FINANCING SUCH ASSETS. OUR EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO THESE NON-RECOURSE, OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCINGS IS LIMITED TO  $1.3 BILLION  . AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THERE WAS  $9.4 BILLION  IN TOTAL OUTSTANDING UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS UNDERLYING SUCH SECURITIZATION TRUSTS THAT REPRESENT OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCINGS.  WE HAVE A CO-INVESTMENT IN A PORTFOLIO OF CONSUMER LOANS HELD THROUGH AN ENTITY (\u201cLOANCO\u201d) WHICH WE ACCOUNT FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD. LOANCO HAD OUTSTANDING DEBT OF  $205.6 MILLION  AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  . WE HAVE NOT GUARANTEED THIS DEBT.  WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  . WE DID NOT HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS STRUCTURED INVESTMENT VEHICLES, OR SPECIAL PURPOSE OR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, ESTABLISHED TO FACILITATE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES, OTHER THAN THE ENTITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE. FURTHER, WE HAVE NOT GUARANTEED ANY OBLIGATIONS OF UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR ENTERED INTO ANY COMMITMENT AND DO NOT INTEND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ANY SUCH ENTITIES.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  INCLUDED ALL OF THE MATERIAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS REFERRED TO IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018  , EXCLUDING DEBT THAT WAS REPAID AS DESCRIBED IN \u201c\u2014LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u2014DEBT OBLIGATIONS.\u201d  IN ADDITION, WE EXECUTED THE FOLLOWING MATERIAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  .  \u2022  DERIVATIVES \u2013  AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 10 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE HAVE ALTERED THE COMPOSITION OF OUR ECONOMIC HEDGES DURING THE PERIOD.  \u2022  DEBT OBLIGATIONS  \u2013 AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 11 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE BORROWED ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS.  SEE NOTES 14 AND 18 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT FOR INFORMATION REGARDING COMMITMENTS AND MATERIAL CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO SUBSEQUENT TO  MARCH 31, 2019  , IF ANY. AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO PURCHASE CERTAIN FUTURE SERVICER ADVANCES. THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE ADVANCES IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. HOWEVER, WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT NET RECOVERIES OF SERVICER ADVANCES WILL EXCEED NET FUNDINGS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THIS EXPECTATION IS BASED ON JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN \u201c\u2014APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u2014SERVICER ADVANCE INVESTMENTS.\u201d IN ADDITION, THE CONSUMER LOAN COMPANIES HAVE INVESTED IN LOANS WITH AN AGGREGATE OF  $384.0 MILLION  OF UNFUNDED AND AVAILABLE REVOLVING CREDIT PRIVILEGES AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  . HOWEVER, UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE LOANS, REQUESTS FOR DRAWS MAY BE DENIED AND UNFUNDED AVAILABILITY MAY BE TERMINATED AT MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCRETION.  INFLATION  VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE FINANCIAL IN NATURE. AS A RESULT, INTEREST RATES AND OTHER FACTORS AFFECT OUR PERFORMANCE MORE SO THAN INFLATION, ALTHOUGH INFLATION RATES CAN OFTEN HAVE A MEANINGFUL INFLUENCE OVER THE DIRECTION OF INTEREST RATES. FURTHERMORE, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND OUR DISTRIBUTIONS ARE DETERMINED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS PRIMARILY BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TAXABLE INCOME, AND, IN EACH CASE, OUR ACTIVITIES AND BALANCE SHEET ARE MEASURED WITH REFERENCE TO HISTORICAL COST AND/OR FAIR MARKET VALUE WITHOUT CONSIDERING INFLATION. SEE \u201cQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\u2014INTEREST RATE RISK.\u201d  CORE EARNINGS  WE HAVE FOUR PRIMARY VARIABLES THAT IMPACT OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE: (I) THE CURRENT YIELD EARNED ON OUR INVESTMENTS, (II) THE INTEREST EXPENSE UNDER THE DEBT INCURRED TO FINANCE OUR INVESTMENTS, (III) OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND TAXES AND (IV) OUR REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES, INCLUDING ANY IMPAIRMENT, ON OUR INVESTMENTS. \u201cCORE EARNINGS\u201d IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, EXCLUDING THE FOURTH VARIABLE ABOVE AND ADJUSTS THE EARNINGS FROM THE CONSUMER LOAN INVESTMENT TO A LEVEL YIELD BASIS. CORE EARNINGS IS USED BY MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE OUR PERFORMANCE WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT: (I) REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH ALTHOUGH THEY REPRESENT A PART OF OUR RECURRING OPERATIONS, ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY AND ARE GENERALLY LIMITED TO A POTENTIAL INDICATOR OF FUTURE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE; (II) INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR MANAGER; (III) NON-CAPITALIZED TRANSACTION-RELATED EXPENSES; AND (IV) DEFERRED TAXES, WHICH ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF CURRENT OPERATIONS.  OUR DEFINITION OF CORE EARNINGS INCLUDES ACCRETION ON HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS AS IF THEY CONTINUED TO BE HELD-FOR-INVESTMENT. ALTHOUGH WE INTEND TO SELL SUCH LOANS, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT SUCH LOANS WILL BE SOLD OR THAT THEY WILL BE SOLD WITHIN ANY EXPECTED TIMEFRAME. DURING THE PERIOD PRIOR TO SALE, WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE CASH FLOWS FROM SUCH LOANS AND BELIEVE THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE TO RECORD A YIELD THEREON. IN ADDITION, OUR DEFINITION OF CORE EARNINGS EXCLUDES ALL DEFERRED TAXES, RATHER THAN JUST DEFERRED TAXES RELATED TO UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES, BECAUSE WE BELIEVE DEFERRED TAXES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF CURRENT OPERATIONS. OUR DEFINITION OF CORE EARNINGS ALSO LIMITS ACCRETED INTEREST INCOME ON RMBS WHERE WE RECEIVE PAR UPON THE EXERCISE OF ASSOCIATED CALL RIGHTS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, NET OF RELATED COSTS INCLUDING ADVANCES. WE CREATED THIS LIMIT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE  90  TO ACCRETE TO THE LOWER OF PAR OR THE NET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, IN INSTANCES WHERE THE NET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL IS LOWER THAN PAR. WE BELIEVE THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF ACCRETION WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO EARN ON SUCH BONDS HAD THE CALL RIGHTS NOT BEEN EXERCISED.  OUR INVESTMENTS IN CONSUMER LOANS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER ASC NO. 310-20 AND ASC NO. 310-30, INCLUDING CERTAIN NON-PERFORMING CONSUMER LOANS WITH REVOLVING PRIVILEGES THAT ARE EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED FROM BEING ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER ASC NO. 310-30. UNDER ASC NO. 310-20, THE RECOGNITION OF EXPECTED LOSSES ON THESE NON-PERFORMING CONSUMER LOANS IS DELAYED IN COMPARISON TO THE LEVEL YIELD METHODOLOGY UNDER ASC NO. 310-30, WHICH RECOGNIZES INCOME BASED ON AN EXPECTED CASH FLOW MODEL REFLECTING AN INVESTMENT\u2019S LIFETIME EXPECTED LOSSES. THE PURPOSE OF THE CORE EARNINGS ADJUSTMENT TO ADJUST CONSUMER LOANS TO A LEVEL YIELD IS TO PRESENT INCOME RECOGNITION ACROSS THE CONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO IN THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS ECONOMICALLY EARNED, AVOID POTENTIAL DELAYS IN LOSS RECOGNITION, AND ALIGN IT WITH OUR OVERALL PORTFOLIO OF MORTGAGE-RELATED ASSETS WHICH GENERALLY RECORD INCOME ON A LEVEL YIELD BASIS. WITH RESPECT TO CONSUMER LOANS CLASSIFIED AS HELD-FOR-SALE, THE LEVEL YIELD IS COMPUTED THROUGH THE EXPECTED SALE DATE. WITH RESPECT TO THE GAINS RECORDED UNDER GAAP IN 2014 AND 2016 AS A RESULT OF A REFINANCING OF, AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF, THE CONSUMER LOAN COMPANIES, RESPECTIVELY, WE CONTINUE TO RECORD A LEVEL YIELD ON THOSE ASSETS BASED ON THEIR ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE.  WHILE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR MANAGER MAY BE A MATERIAL OPERATING EXPENSE, WE EXCLUDE IT FROM CORE EARNINGS BECAUSE (I) FROM TIME TO TIME, A COMPONENT OF THE COMPUTATION OF THIS EXPENSE WILL RELATE TO ITEMS (SUCH AS GAINS OR LOSSES) THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM CORE EARNINGS, AND (II) IT IS IMPRACTICAL TO DETERMINE THE PORTION OF THE EXPENSE RELATED TO CORE EARNINGS AND NON-CORE EARNINGS, AND THE TYPE OF EARNINGS (LOSS) THAT CREATED AN EXCESS (DEFICIT) ABOVE OR BELOW, AS APPLICABLE, THE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION THRESHOLD. TO ILLUSTRATE WHY IT IS IMPRACTICAL TO DETERMINE THE PORTION OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSE THAT SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TO CORE EARNINGS, WE NOTE THAT, AS AN EXAMPLE, IN A GIVEN PERIOD, WE MAY HAVE CORE EARNINGS IN EXCESS OF THE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION THRESHOLD BUT INCUR LOSSES (WHICH ARE EXCLUDED FROM CORE EARNINGS) THAT REDUCE TOTAL EARNINGS BELOW THE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION THRESHOLD. IN SUCH CASE, WE WOULD EITHER NEED TO (A) ALLOCATE ZERO INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO CORE EARNINGS, EVEN THOUGH CORE EARNINGS EXCEEDED THE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION THRESHOLD, OR (B) ASSIGN A \u201cPRO FORMA\u201d AMOUNT OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO CORE EARNINGS, EVEN THOUGH NO INCENTIVE COMPENSATION WAS ACTUALLY INCURRED. WE BELIEVE THAT NEITHER OF THESE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES ACHIEVES A LOGICAL RESULT. ACCORDINGLY, THE EXCLUSION OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION FACILITATES COMPARABILITY BETWEEN PERIODS AND AVOIDS THE DISTORTION TO OUR NON-GAAP OPERATING MEASURE THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE INCLUSION OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION THAT RELATES TO NON-CORE EARNINGS.  WITH REGARD TO NON-CAPITALIZED TRANSACTION-RELATED EXPENSES, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT VIEW THESE COSTS AS PART OF OUR CORE OPERATIONS, AS THEY ARE CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE SIMILAR TO REALIZED LOSSES INCURRED AT ACQUISITION. NON-CAPITALIZED TRANSACTION-RELATED EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY LEGAL AND VALUATION SERVICE COSTS, AS WELL AS OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FEES, INCURRED WHEN WE ACQUIRE CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES.  AS OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, AS A RESULT OF THE SHELLPOINT ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, NEWREZ, ORIGINATES CONVENTIONAL, GOVERNMENT-INSURED AND NONCONFORMING RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS FOR SALE AND SECURITIZATION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSFER OF LOANS TO THE GSES OR MORTGAGE INVESTORS, NEW RESIDENTIAL REPORTS REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE OF ORIGINATED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS AND RETENTION OF MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS AN INDICATOR OF PERFORMANCE FOR THE SERVICING AND ORIGINATION SEGMENT AND THEREFORE INCLUDED IN CORE EARNINGS. REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE SALE OF ORIGINATED RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS HAD NO IMPACT ON CORE EARNINGS IN ANY PRIOR PERIOD, BUT MAY IMPACT CORE EARNINGS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ADJUSTMENTS TO COMPUTE \u201cCORE EARNINGS\u201d SPECIFIED ABOVE ALLOW INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO READILY IDENTIFY AND TRACK THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE ASSETS THAT FORM THE CORE OF OUR ACTIVITY, ASSIST IN COMPARING THE CORE OPERATING RESULTS BETWEEN PERIODS, AND ENABLE INVESTORS TO EVALUATE OUR CURRENT CORE PERFORMANCE USING THE SAME MEASURE THAT MANAGEMENT USES TO OPERATE THE BUSINESS. MANAGEMENT ALSO UTILIZES CORE EARNINGS AS A MEASURE IN ITS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS RELATING TO IMPROVEMENTS TO THE UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTAL OPERATIONS OF OUR INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES BETWEEN THOSE INVESTMENTS, AND MANAGEMENT ALSO RELIES ON CORE EARNINGS AS AN INDICATOR OF THE RESULTS OF SUCH DECISIONS. CORE EARNINGS EXCLUDES CERTAIN RECURRING ITEMS, SUCH AS GAINS AND LOSSES (INCLUDING IMPAIRMENT AS WELL AS DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES) AND NON-CAPITALIZED TRANSACTION-RELATED EXPENSES, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE PART OF OUR CORE OPERATIONS FOR THE REASONS DESCRIBED HEREIN. AS SUCH, CORE EARNINGS IS NOT INTENDED TO REFLECT ALL OF OUR ACTIVITY AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS ONLY ONE OF THE FACTORS USED BY MANAGEMENT IN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE, ALONG WITH GAAP NET INCOME WHICH IS INCLUSIVE OF ALL OF OUR ACTIVITIES.  THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CORE EARNINGS AND THE MEASURE WE USE TO CALCULATE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION RELATE TO (I) REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES (INCLUDING IMPAIRMENTS), (II) NON-CAPITALIZED TRANSACTION-RELATED EXPENSES AND (III) DEFERRED TAXES (OTHER THAN THOSE RELATED TO UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES). EACH ARE EXCLUDED FROM CORE EARNINGS AND INCLUDED IN OUR INCENTIVE COMPENSATION MEASURE (EITHER IMMEDIATELY OR THROUGH AMORTIZATION). IN ADDITION, OUR INCENTIVE COMPENSATION MEASURE DOES NOT INCLUDE ACCRETION ON HELD-FOR-SALE LOANS AND THE TIMING OF RECOGNITION OF INCOME FROM CONSUMER LOANS IS DIFFERENT. UNLIKE CORE EARNINGS, OUR INCENTIVE  91  COMPENSATION MEASURE IS INTENDED TO REFLECT ALL REALIZED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE GAIN ON REMEASUREMENT OF CONSUMER LOANS INVESTMENT WAS TREATED AS AN UNREALIZED GAIN FOR THE PURPOSES OF CALCULATING INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND WAS THEREFORE EXCLUDED FROM SUCH CALCULATION.  CORE EARNINGS DOES NOT REPRESENT AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO, NET INCOME OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, EACH AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, AND OUR CALCULATION OF THIS MEASURE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY ENTITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. FOR A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS AND NET INCOME, SEE \u201c\u2014LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d ABOVE. SET FORTH BELOW IS A RECONCILIATION OF CORE EARNINGS TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).

RISK FACTORS\u201d CONTAINED HEREIN AND IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  OVERVIEW  REFERENCES TO \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cOUR,\u201d \u201cUS\u201d AND \u201cOUR COMPANY\u201d REFER TO AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, INC., A MARYLAND CORPORATION, TOGETHER WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, L.P., A MARYLAND LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, OF WHICH WE ARE THE SOLE GENERAL PARTNER AND WHICH WE REFER TO IN THIS REPORT AS OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  WE ARE A FULL SERVICE, VERTICALLY INTEGRATED AND SELF-ADMINISTERED REIT THAT OWNS, OPERATES, ACQUIRES AND DEVELOPS HIGH QUALITY RETAIL, OFFICE, MULTIFAMILY AND MIXED-USE PROPERTIES IN ATTRACTIVE, HIGH-BARRIER-TO-ENTRY MARKETS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, OREGON, WASHINGTON, TEXAS AND HAWAII. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR PORTFOLIO WAS COMPRISED OF  TWELVE  RETAIL SHOPPING CENTERS;  EIGHT  OFFICE PROPERTIES; A MIXED-USE PROPERTY CONSISTING OF A 369-ROOM ALL-SUITE HOTEL AND A RETAIL SHOPPING CENTER; AND  SIX  MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE OWNED LAND AT THREE OF OUR PROPERTIES THAT WE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT AND/OR CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS.  OUR CORE MARKETS INCLUDE SAN DIEGO; THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA; PORTLAND, OREGON; BELLEVUE, WASHINGTON; AND OAHU, HAWAII. WE ARE A MARYLAND CORPORATION FORMED ON JULY 16, 2010 TO ACQUIRE THE ENTITIES OWNING VARIOUS CONTROLLING AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN REAL ESTATE ASSETS OWNED AND/OR MANAGED BY ERNEST S. RADY OR HIS AFFILIATES, INCLUDING THE ERNEST RADY TRUST U/D/T MARCH 13, 1983, OR THE RADY TRUST, AND DID NOT HAVE ANY OPERATING ACTIVITY UNTIL THE CONSUMMATION OF OUR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING ON JANUARY 19, 2011.  OUR COMPANY, AS THE SOLE GENERAL PARTNER OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, HAS CONTROL OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND OWNED  73.3%  OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  . ACCORDINGLY, WE CONSOLIDATE THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  WE IDENTIFIED CERTAIN CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT AFFECT CERTAIN OF OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . WE HAVE NOT MADE ANY MATERIAL CHANGES TO THESE POLICIES DURING THE PERIODS COVERED BY THIS REPORT, OTHER THAN THOSE DESCRIBED IN FOOTNOTE 1.  SAME-STORE  WE HAVE PROVIDED CERTAIN INFORMATION ON A TOTAL PORTFOLIO, SAME-STORE AND REDEVELOPMENT SAME-STORE BASIS. INFORMATION PROVIDED ON A SAME-STORE BASIS INCLUDES THE RESULTS OF PROPERTIES THAT WE OWNED AND OPERATED FOR THE ENTIRETY OF BOTH PERIODS BEING COMPARED EXCEPT FOR PROPERTIES FOR WHICH SIGNIFICANT REDEVELOPMENT OR EXPANSION OCCURRED DURING EITHER OF THE PERIODS BEING COMPARED, PROPERTIES UNDER DEVELOPMENT, PROPERTIES CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PROPERTIES CLASSIFIED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  INFORMATION PROVIDED ON A REDEVELOPMENT SAME-STORE BASIS INCLUDES THE RESULTS OF PROPERTIES UNDERGOING SIGNIFICANT REDEVELOPMENT FOR THE ENTIRETY OR PORTION OF BOTH PERIODS BEING COMPARED.  SAME-STORE AND REDEVELOPMENT SAME-STORE IS CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE IMPORTANT MEASURES BECAUSE THEY ASSIST IN ELIMINATING DISPARITIES DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT, ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES DURING THE PARTICULAR PERIOD PRESENTED, AND THUS PROVIDES A MORE CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE MEASURE FOR THE COMPARISON OF THE COMPANY'S STABILIZED AND REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES, AS APPLICABLE.  ADDITIONALLY, REDEVELOPMENT SAME-STORE IS CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE AN IMPORTANT MEASURE BECAUSE IT ASSISTS IN EVALUATING THE TIMING OF THE START AND STABILIZATION OF OUR REDEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND THE IMPACT THAT THESE REDEVELOPMENTS HAVE IN ENHANCING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  WHILE THERE IS JUDGMENT SURROUNDING CHANGES IN DESIGNATIONS, WE TYPICALLY RECLASSIFY SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT, REDEVELOPMENT OR EXPANSION PROPERTIES INTO SAME-STORE PROPERTIES ONCE THEY ARE STABILIZED.  PROPERTIES ARE DEEMED STABILIZED TYPICALLY AT THE EARLIER OF (I) REACHING 90% OCCUPANCY OR (II) FOUR QUARTERS FOLLOWING A PROPERTY'S INCLUSION IN OPERATING REAL ESTATE.  WE TYPICALLY REMOVE PROPERTIES FROM SAME-STORE PROPERTIES WHEN THE DEVELOPMENT, REDEVELOPMENT OR EXPANSION HAS OR IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE PROPERTY'S ANNUALIZED BASE RENT, OCCUPANCY AND OPERATING INCOME WITHIN THE CALENDAR YEAR. OUR EVALUATION OF SIGNIFICANT IMPACT RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT, REDEVELOPMENT OR EXPANSION ACTIVITY IS BASED ON QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE MEASURES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING: THE TOTAL BUDGETED COST OF PLANNED CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY COMPARED TO THE PROPERTY\u2019S ANNUALIZED BASE RENT, OCCUPANCY AND PROPERTY OPERATING INCOME WITHIN THE CALENDAR YEAR; PERCENTAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, REDEVELOPMENT OR EXPANSION SQUARE FOOTAGE TO TOTAL PROPERTY SQUARE FOOTAGE; AND THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN HISTORIC OCCUPANCY AND RENTAL RATES. IN CONSIDERATION OF THESE MEASURES, WE GENERALLY REMOVE PROPERTIES FROM SAME-STORE PROPERTIES WHEN WE SEE A DECLINE IN A PROPERTY'S ANNUALIZED BASE RENT, OCCUPANCY AND OPERATING INCOME WITHIN THE CALENDAR YEAR AS A DIRECT RESULT OF ONGOING REDEVELOPMENT, DEVELOPMENT OR EXPANSION ACTIVITY. ACQUIRED PROPERTIES ARE CLASSIFIED  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTO SAME-STORE PROPERTIES ONCE WE HAVE OWNED SUCH PROPERTIES FOR THE ENTIRETY OF COMPARABLE PERIOD(S) AND THE PROPERTIES ARE NOT UNDER SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT OR EXPANSION.  BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF OUR SAME-STORE COMPOSITION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  .  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , PACIFIC RIDGE APARTMENTS AND GATEWAY MARKETPLACE WERE RECLASSIFIED TO SAME-STORE PROPERTIES WHEN COMPARED TO THE DESIGNATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AS THE ENTITIES WERE ACQUIRED ON APRIL 28, 2017 AND JULY 6, 2017, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE COMPARABLE FOR THE THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , WAIKIKI BEACH WALK RETAIL AND EMBASSY SUITESTM HOTEL WAS RECLASSIFIED TO NON-SAME-STORE PROPERTIES WHEN COMPARED TO THE DESIGNATION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 DUE TO SPALLING REPAIR ACTIVITY DISRUPTING THE HOTEL PORTION OF THE PROPERTIES OPERATIONS. WAIKELE CENTER IS CLASSIFIED AS A NON-SAME-STORE PROPERTY DUE TO SIGNIFICANT REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY. TORREY POINT WAS PLACED INTO OPERATIONS AND BECAME AVAILABLE FOR OCCUPANCY IN AUGUST 2018 AND WILL BE CLASSIFIED AS A NON-SAME-STORE PROPERTY UNTIL IT BECOMES STABILIZED AND COMPARABLE.  IN OUR DETERMINATION OF SAME-STORE AND REDEVELOPMENT SAME-STORE PROPERTIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , WAIKELE CENTER HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A SAME-STORE REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTY DUE TO SIGNIFICANT CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY.  RETAIL SAME-STORE NET OPERATING INCOME  INCREASED  APPROXIMATELY  26.9%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . RETAIL REDEVELOPMENT SAME-STORE NET OPERATING INCOME  INCREASED  APPROXIMATELY  15.1%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  SAME-STORE  24  23  NON-SAME STORE  3  3  TOTAL PROPERTIES  27  26  REDEVELOPMENT SAME-STORE  25  24  TOTAL DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES  3  4  OUTLOOK  WE SEEK GROWTH IN EARNINGS, FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS PRIMARILY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING: GROWTH IN OUR SAME-STORE PORTFOLIO, GROWTH IN OUR PORTFOLIO FROM PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENTS AND EXPANSION OF OUR PORTFOLIO THROUGH PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS. OUR PROPERTIES ARE LOCATED IN SOME OF THE NATION'S MOST DYNAMIC, HIGH-BARRIER-TO-ENTRY MARKETS PRIMARILY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, OREGON, WASHINGTON AND HAWAII, WHICH ALLOW US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF REDEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT ENHANCE OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE THROUGH RENOVATION, EXPANSION, RECONFIGURATION AND/OR RETENANTING. WE EVALUATE OUR PROPERTIES ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO IDENTIFY THESE TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES.  WE INTEND TO OPPORTUNISTICALLY PURSUE THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUTURE PHASES OF LLOYD DISTRICT PORTFOLIO BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUR EVALUATION OF WHETHER SUCH OPPORTUNITIES WOULD GENERATE APPROPRIATE RISK-ADJUSTED FINANCIAL RETURNS. OUR REDEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS AND MAY NOT ULTIMATELY COME TO FRUITION.  WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR PRIMARY MARKETS THAT WOULD COMPLEMENT OUR PORTFOLIO AND PROVIDE LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. SOME OF OUR ACQUISITIONS DO NOT INITIALLY CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO EARNINGS GROWTH; HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THEY PROVIDE LONG-TERM RE-LEASING GROWTH, REDEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND OTHER STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES. ANY GROWTH FROM ACQUISITIONS IS CONTINGENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO FIND PROPERTIES THAT MEET OUR QUALITATIVE STANDARDS AT PRICES THAT MEET OUR FINANCIAL HURDLES. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES MAY AFFECT OUR SUCCESS IN ACHIEVING EARNINGS GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITIONS BY AFFECTING BOTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID TO ACQUIRE A PROPERTY, AS WELL AS OUR ABILITY TO ECONOMICALLY FINANCE A PROPERTY ACQUISITION. GENERALLY, OUR ACQUISITIONS ARE INITIALLY FINANCED BY AVAILABLE CASH, MORTGAGE LOANS AND/OR BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT, WHICH MAY BE REPAID LATER WITH FUNDS RAISED THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF NEW EQUITY OR NEW LONG-TERM DEBT.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LEASING  OUR SAME-STORE GROWTH IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN RENTAL RATES ON NEW LEASES AND LEASE RENEWALS AND CHANGES IN PORTFOLIO OCCUPANCY. OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE THAT THE INFILL NATURE AND STRONG DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR PROPERTIES PROVIDE US WITH A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE, ALLOWING US TO MAINTAIN RELATIVELY HIGH OCCUPANCY AND INCREASE RENTAL RATES. WE HAVE CONTINUED TO SEE SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT FOR MANY OF OUR TENANTS, AS WELL AS INCREASED INTEREST FROM PROSPECTIVE TENANTS FOR OUR SPACES. WHILE THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE POSITIVE SIGNS WILL CONTINUE, WE REMAIN CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC REGARDING THE IMPROVED TRENDS WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. WE BELIEVE THE LOCATIONS OF OUR PROPERTIES AND DIVERSE TENANT BASE MITIGATE THE POTENTIALLY NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.  HOWEVER, ANY REDUCTION IN OUR TENANTS' ABILITIES TO PAY BASE RENT, PERCENTAGE RENT OR OTHER CHARGES WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , WE SIGNED  17  RETAIL LEASES FOR A TOTAL OF  159,746  SQUARE FEET OF RETAIL SPACE INCLUDING  48,376  SQUARE FEET OF COMPARABLE SPACE LEASES (LEASES FOR WHICH THERE WAS A PRIOR TENANT), AT AN AVERAGE RENTAL RATE  INCREASE  ON A CASH AND GAAP BASIS OF  5.7%  AND  15.2%  , RESPECTIVELY.  NEW RETAIL LEASES FOR COMPARABLE SPACES WERE SIGNED FOR  2,441  SQUARE FEET AT AN AVERAGE RENTAL RATE  DECREASE  ON A CASH AND GAAP BASIS OF  5.4%  AND  15.0%  , RESPECTIVELY. RENEWALS FOR COMPARABLE RETAIL SPACES WERE SIGNED FOR  45,935  SQUARE FEET AT AN AVERAGE RENTAL RATE  INCREASE  ON A CASH AND GAAP BASIS OF  6.4%  AND  15.2%  , RESPECTIVELY. TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND INCENTIVES WERE  $120.48  PER SQUARE FOOT OF RETAIL SPACE FOR COMPARABLE NEW LEASES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , MAINLY DUE TO TO TENANTS AT CARMEL MOUNTAIN PLAZA.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , WE SIGNED  12  OFFICE LEASES FOR A TOTAL OF  70,228  SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE INCLUDING  37,541  SQUARE FEET OF COMPARABLE SPACE LEASES, AT AN AVERAGE RENTAL RATE  INCREASE  ON A CASH AND GAAP BASIS OF  4.2%  AND  14.6%  , RESPECTIVELY.  NEW OFFICE LEASES FOR COMPARABLE SPACES WERE SIGNED FOR  7,506  SQUARE FEET AT AN AVERAGE RENTAL RATE  INCREASE  ON A CASH AND GAAP BASIS OF  6.6%  AND  23.2%  , RESPECTIVELY.  RENEWALS FOR COMPARABLE OFFICE SPACES WERE SIGNED FOR  30,035  SQUARE FEET AT AN AVERAGE RENTAL RATE  INCREASE  ON A CASH AND GAAP BASIS OF  3.6%  AND  12.7%  , RESPECTIVELY. TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND INCENTIVES WERE  $75.00  PER SQUARE FOOT OF OFFICE SPACE FOR COMPARABLE NEW LEASES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , MAINLY ATTRIBUTED TO TENANTS AT TORREY RESERVE CAMPUS.  THE RENTAL INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH COMPARABLE SPACES GENERALLY INCLUDE ALL LEASES SIGNED IN ARMS-LENGTH TRANSACTIONS REFLECTING MARKET LEVERAGE BETWEEN LANDLORDS AND TENANTS DURING THE PERIOD. THE COMPARISON BETWEEN AVERAGE RENT FOR EXPIRING LEASES AND NEW LEASES IS DETERMINED BY INCLUDING MINIMUM RENT AND PERCENTAGE RENT PAID ON THE EXPIRING LEASE AND MINIMUM RENT AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, PROJECTIONS OF FIRST LEASE YEAR PERCENTAGE RENT, TO BE PAID ON THE NEW LEASE. IN SOME INSTANCES, MANAGEMENT EXERCISES JUDGMENT AS TO HOW TO MOST EFFECTIVELY REFLECT THE COMPARABILITY OF SPACES REPORTED IN THIS CALCULATION. THE CHANGE IN RENTAL INCOME ON COMPARABLE SPACE LEASES IS IMPACTED BY NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING CURRENT MARKET RATES, LOCATION, INDIVIDUAL TENANT CREDITWORTHINESS, USE OF SPACE, MARKET CONDITIONS WHEN THE EXPIRING LEASE WAS SIGNED, CAPITAL INVESTMENT MADE IN THE SPACE AND THE SPECIFIC LEASE STRUCTURE. TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND INCENTIVES INCLUDE THE TOTAL DOLLARS COMMITTED FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF A SPACE AS IT RELATES TO A SPECIFIC LEASE, BUT MAY ALSO INCLUDE BASE-BUILDING COSTS (I.E. EXPANSION, ESCALATORS OR NEW ENTRANCES) WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE THE SPACE LEASABLE. INCENTIVES INCLUDE AMOUNTS PAID TO TENANTS AS AN INDUCEMENT TO SIGN A LEASE THAT DO NOT REPRESENT BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS.  THE LEASES SIGNED IN  2019  GENERALLY BECOME EFFECTIVE OVER THE FOLLOWING YEAR, THOUGH SOME MAY NOT BECOME EFFECTIVE UNTIL 2020 AND BEYOND. FURTHER, THERE IS RISK THAT SOME NEW TENANTS WILL NOT ULTIMATELY TAKE POSSESSION OF THEIR SPACE AND THAT TENANTS FOR BOTH NEW AND RENEWAL LEASES MAY NOT PAY ALL OF THEIR CONTRACTUAL RENT DUE TO OPERATING, FINANCING OR OTHER MATTERS. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT THESE INCREASES DO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TENANT/LANDLORD RELATIONSHIP AND THE POTENTIAL FLUCTUATIONS WE MAY ACHIEVE IN RENTAL INCOME OVER TIME.  THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF  2019  , WE BELIEVE OUR LEASING VOLUME WILL BE IN-LINE WITH OUR HISTORICAL AVERAGES AND RESULT IN OVERALL POSITIVE INCREASES IN RENTAL INCOME. HOWEVER, CHANGES IN RENTAL INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUAL SIGNED LEASES ON COMPARABLE SPACES MAY BE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, AND WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE RENTS ON NEW LEASES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AT THE ABOVE DISCLOSED LEVELS, IF AT ALL.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CAPITALIZED COSTS  CERTAIN EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL COSTS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT OF REAL ESTATE, INCLUDING PRE-CONSTRUCTION COSTS, REAL ESTATE TAXES, INSURANCE, INTEREST, CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND SALARIES AND RELATED COSTS OF PERSONNEL DIRECTLY INVOLVED, ARE CAPITALIZED.  WE CAPITALIZE COSTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT UNTIL CONSTRUCTION IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE AND THE PROPERTY IS HELD AVAILABLE FOR OCCUPANCY.  THE DETERMINATION OF WHEN A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE AND WHEN CAPITALIZATION MUST CEASE INVOLVES A DEGREE OF JUDGMENT.  WE CONSIDER A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT AS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE AND HELD AVAILABLE FOR OCCUPANCY UPON THE COMPLETION OF LANDLORD-OWNED TENANT IMPROVEMENTS OR WHEN THE LESSEE TAKES POSSESSION OF THE UNIMPROVED SPACE FOR CONSTRUCTION OF ITS OWN IMPROVEMENTS, BUT NOT LATER THAN ONE YEAR FROM CESSATION OF MAJOR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. WE CEASE CAPITALIZATION ON THE PORTION SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED AND OCCUPIED OR HELD AVAILABLE FOR OCCUPANCY, AND CAPITALIZE ONLY THOSE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY REMAINING PORTION UNDER CONSTRUCTION.  WE CAPITALIZED EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL COSTS RELATED TO BOTH DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES COMBINED OF  $1.7 MILLION  AND  $0.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  WE CAPITALIZED EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL COSTS RELATED TO OTHER PROPERTY IMPROVEMENTS COMBINED OF  $24.3 MILLION  AND  $8.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  INTEREST COSTS ON DEVELOPMENTS AND MAJOR REDEVELOPMENTS ARE CAPITALIZED AS PART OF DEVELOPMENTS AND REDEVELOPMENTS NOT YET PLACED IN SERVICE. CAPITALIZATION OF INTEREST COMMENCES WHEN DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND EXPENDITURES BEGIN AND END UPON COMPLETION, WHICH IS WHEN THE ASSET IS READY FOR ITS INTENDED USE AS NOTED ABOVE. WE MAKE JUDGMENTS AS TO THE TIME PERIOD OVER WHICH TO CAPITALIZE SUCH COSTS AND THESE ASSUMPTIONS HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON NET INCOME BECAUSE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE NOT SUBTRACTED IN CALCULATING NET INCOME. IF THE TIME PERIOD FOR CAPITALIZING INTEREST IS EXTENDED, HOWEVER, MORE INTEREST IS CAPITALIZED, THEREBY DECREASING INTEREST EXPENSE AND INCREASING NET INCOME DURING THAT PERIOD. WE CAPITALIZED INTEREST COSTS RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES OF  $0.2 MILLION  AND  $0.5 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FOR OUR DISCUSSION OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WE HAVE PROVIDED INFORMATION ON A TOTAL PORTFOLIO AND SAME-STORE BASIS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, INC.  IN THIS \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, INC.\u201d SECTION, THE TERM THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d REFERS ONLY TO AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, INC. ON AN UNCONSOLIDATED BASIS, AND EXCLUDES THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND ALL OTHER SUBSIDIARIES.  THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS IS OPERATED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, OF WHICH THE COMPANY IS THE PARENT COMPANY AND SOLE GENERAL PARTNER, AND WHICH IT CONSOLIDATES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES.  BECAUSE THE COMPANY OPERATES ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS WITH THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF AMERICAN  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ASSETS TRUST, L.P.\u201d SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS SECTION TO UNDERSTAND THE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AND HOW THE COMPANY IS OPERATED AS A WHOLE.  THE COMPANY ISSUES PUBLIC EQUITY FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT DOES NOT OTHERWISE GENERATE ANY CAPITAL ITSELF OR CONDUCT ANY BUSINESS ITSELF, OTHER THAN INCURRING CERTAIN EXPENSES IN OPERATING AS A PUBLIC COMPANY WHICH ARE FULLY REIMBURSED BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. THE COMPANY ITSELF DOES NOT HAVE ANY INDEBTEDNESS, AND ITS ONLY MATERIAL ASSET IS ITS OWNERSHIP OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. THEREFORE, THE CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF THE COMPANY AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP ARE THE SAME ON THEIR RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  HOWEVER, ALL DEBT IS HELD DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. THE COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL FUNDING REQUIREMENT IS THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK. THE COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ITS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IS DISTRIBUTIONS IT RECEIVES FROM THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY OWNED AN APPROXIMATE  73.3%  PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  THE REMAINING  26.7%  ARE OWNED BY NON-AFFILIATED INVESTORS AND CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.  AS THE SOLE GENERAL PARTNER OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, INC. HAS THE FULL, EXCLUSIVE AND COMPLETE AUTHORITY AND CONTROL OVER THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT AND BUSINESS, CAN CAUSE IT TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN MAJOR TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND REFINANCINGS, AND CAN CAUSE CHANGES IN ITS LINE OF BUSINESS, CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND DISTRIBUTION POLICIES.  THE COMPANY CAUSES THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO DISTRIBUTE SUCH PORTION OF ITS AVAILABLE CASH AS THE COMPANY MAY IN ITS DISCRETION DETERMINE, IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT.  THE LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S ABILITY TO MAKE SUFFICIENT DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY. THE PRIMARY CASH REQUIREMENT OF THE COMPANY IS ITS PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS. THE COMPANY ALSO GUARANTEES SOME OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S DEBT, AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE 7 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE HEREIN. IF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP FAILS TO FULFILL CERTAIN OF ITS DEBT REQUIREMENTS, WHICH TRIGGER THE COMPANY\u2019S GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS, THEN THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL ITS CASH PAYMENT COMMITMENTS UNDER SUCH GUARANTEES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY\u2019S ONLY SIGNIFICANT ASSET IS ITS INVESTMENT IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  WE BELIEVE THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S SOURCES OF WORKING CAPITAL, SPECIFICALLY ITS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AND BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER ITS UNSECURED LINE OF CREDIT, ARE ADEQUATE FOR IT TO MAKE ITS DISTRIBUTION PAYMENTS TO THE COMPANY AND, IN TURN, FOR THE COMPANY TO MAKE ITS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT IT HAS ADEQUATE WORKING CAPITAL TO MEET ITS DIVIDEND FUNDING OBLIGATIONS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S SOURCES OF CAPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE AT ALL OR IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS NEEDS, INCLUDING ITS ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTION PAYMENTS TO THE COMPANY. THE UNAVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S ABILITY TO PAY ITS DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMPANY, WHICH WOULD IN TURN, ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS.  OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FUNDS TO PAY FOR FUTURE DIVIDENDS EXPECTED TO BE PAID TO THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCKHOLDERS, OPERATING EXPENSES AND OTHER EXPENDITURES DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PROPERTIES, INTEREST EXPENSE AND SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, FUNDING CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND LEASING COMMISSIONS.  THE COMPANY MAY FROM TIME TO TIME SEEK TO REPURCHASE OR REDEEM THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S OUTSTANDING DEBT, THE COMPANY\u2019S SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR OTHER SECURITIES IN OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS OR OTHERWISE. SUCH REPURCHASES OR REDEMPTIONS, IF ANY, WILL DEPEND ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE AMOUNTS INVOLVED MAY BE MATERIAL.  FOR THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN ITS QUALIFICATION AS A REIT, IT MUST PAY DIVIDENDS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS AGGREGATING ANNUALLY AT LEAST 90% OF ITS REIT TAXABLE INCOME, EXCLUDING NET CAPITAL GAINS. WHILE HISTORICALLY THE COMPANY HAS SATISFIED THIS DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT BY MAKING CASH DISTRIBUTIONS TO AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, INC.'S STOCKHOLDERS OR AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, L.P.'S UNITHOLDERS, IT MAY CHOOSE TO SATISFY THIS REQUIREMENT BY MAKING DISTRIBUTIONS OF CASH OR OTHER PROPERTY, INCLUDING, IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY\u2019S OWN STOCK. AS A RESULT OF THIS DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP CANNOT RELY ON RETAINED EARNINGS TO FUND ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS TO THE SAME EXTENT THAT OTHER COMPANIES WHOSE PARENT COMPANIES ARE NOT REITS CAN. THE COMPANY MAY NEED TO CONTINUE TO RAISE CAPITAL IN THE EQUITY MARKETS TO FUND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, ACQUISITIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS.  ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO INTENT AT THIS TIME, IF MARKET CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, THE COMPANY MAY ALSO DELAY THE TIMING OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AS WELL AS LIMIT FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, REDUCE THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S OPERATING EXPENDITURES, OR RE-EVALUATE ITS DIVIDEND POLICY.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY IS A WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER. AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE EQUITY FROM TIME TO TIME ON AN OPPORTUNISTIC BASIS, DEPENDENT UPON MARKET CONDITIONS AND AVAILABLE PRICING. WHEN THE COMPANY RECEIVES PROCEEDS FROM PREFERRED OR COMMON EQUITY ISSUANCES, IT IS REQUIRED BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT TO CONTRIBUTE THE PROCEEDS FROM ITS EQUITY ISSUANCES TO THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP IN EXCHANGE FOR PARTNERSHIP UNITS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP MAY USE THE PROCEEDS TO REPAY DEBT, TO DEVELOP NEW OR EXISTING PROPERTIES, TO ACQUIRE PROPERTIES OR FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE COMPANY FILED A UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3ASR WITH THE SEC, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE UPON FILING AND WHICH REPLACED THE PRIOR FORM S-3ASR THAT WAS FILED WITH THE SEC IN FEBRUARY 2015. THE UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT MAY PERMIT THE COMPANY FROM TIME TO TIME TO OFFER AND SELL EQUITY SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY.  HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE ANY SUCH OFFERINGS OF SECURITIES.  FACTORS INFLUENCING THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL FINANCING INCLUDE INVESTOR PERCEPTION OF OUR PROSPECTS AND THE GENERAL CONDITION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, AMONG OTHERS.  IN MAY 2015, WE ENTERED INTO AN ATM EQUITY PROGRAM WITH FIVE SALES AGENTS IN WHICH WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, OFFER AND SELL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAVING AN AGGREGATE OFFERING PRICE OF UP TO $250.0 MILLION. ON MARCH 2, 2018, WE AMENDED CERTAIN OF THESE EQUITY PROGRAMS, TERMINATED ONE SUCH PROGRAM AND ENTERED INTO A NEW EQUITY PROGRAM WITH ONE NEW SALES AGENT. THE SALES OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK MADE THROUGH THE ATM EQUITY PROGRAM, AS AMENDED, ARE MADE IN \u201cAT-THE-MARKET\u201d OFFERINGS AS DEFINED IN RULE 415 OF THE SECURITIES ACT. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD THE CAPACITY TO ISSUE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $168.8 MILLION  IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THE ATM EQUITY PROGRAM.  WE INTEND TO USE THE NET PROCEEDS TO FUND DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, REPAY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING FROM TIME TO TIME UNDER OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT FACILITY OR OTHER DEBT FINANCING OBLIGATIONS, FUND POTENTIAL ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES AND/OR FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. ACTUAL FUTURE SALES WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, MARKET CONDITIONS, THE TRADING PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AND THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL NEEDS. WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO SELL THE REMAINING SHARES AVAILABLE FOR SALE UNDER THE ATM EQUITY PROGRAM.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, L.P.  IN THIS \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, L.P.\u201d SECTION, THE TERMS \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cOUR\u201d AND \u201cUS\u201d REFER TO THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, OR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, INC. TOGETHER WITH THEIR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, AS THE CONTEXT REQUIRES. AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, INC. IS OUR SOLE GENERAL PARTNER AND CONSOLIDATES OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. BECAUSE WE OPERATE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS WITH AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, INC., THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, INC.\u201d SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS SECTION TO UNDERSTAND OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS.  DUE TO THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE TYPICALLY GENERATE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS. THE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS IS USED FOR THE PAYMENT OF OPERATING EXPENSES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE AND DIVIDENDS TO AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, INC.'S STOCKHOLDERS AND OUR UNITHOLDERS. AS A REIT, AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, INC. MUST GENERALLY MAKE ANNUAL DISTRIBUTIONS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS OF AT LEAST 90% OF ITS NET TAXABLE INCOME. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HELD  $54.5 MILLION  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF OPERATING EXPENSES AND OTHER EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PROPERTIES, REGULAR DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, INC.'S STOCKHOLDERS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ITS REIT STATUS, DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR UNITHOLDERS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND, POTENTIALLY, ACQUISITIONS. WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS THROUGH NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS, RESERVES ESTABLISHED FROM EXISTING CASH AND, IF NECESSARY, BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY.  OUR LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FUNDS NECESSARY TO PAY FOR THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT AT MATURITY, PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS, TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS TO PAY SCHEDULED DEBT MATURITIES AND TO FUND PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS WITH NET CASH FROM OPERATIONS, LONG-TERM SECURED AND UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS AND, IF NECESSARY, THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES. WE ALSO MAY FUND PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS USING OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT FACILITY PENDING PERMANENT FINANCING. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO MULTIPLE SOURCES OF CAPITAL TO FUND OUR LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING THE INCURRENCE OF ADDITIONAL DEBT AND THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT BE ASSURED THAT THIS WILL BE THE CASE. OUR ABILITY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT WILL BE DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR DEGREE OF LEVERAGE, THE VALUE OF OUR UNENCUMBERED ASSETS AND BORROWING RESTRICTIONS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY LENDERS. OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS WILL BE DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS AS WELL, INCLUDING GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS FOR REITS AND MARKET PERCEPTIONS ABOUT OUR COMPANY.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR OVERALL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AND FIRST QUARTER 2020 WILL DEPEND UPON ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES AND THE LEVEL OF IMPROVEMENTS AND REDEVELOPMENTS ON EXISTING PROPERTIES. OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS WILL BE FUNDED ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS WITH CASH ON HAND, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND/OR OUR REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT.  ON A LONG-TERM BASIS, OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS MAY BE FUNDED WITH ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM DEBT. OUR ABILITY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT WILL BE DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR DEGREE OF LEVERAGE, THE VALUE OF OUR UNENCUMBERED ASSETS AND BORROWING RESTRICTIONS THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY LENDERS.  OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS MAY ALSO BE FUNDED BY ADDITIONAL EQUITY INCLUDING SHARES ISSUED BY AMERICAN ASSETS TRUST, INC. UNDER ITS ATM EQUITY PROGRAM.  ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO INTENT AT THIS TIME, IF MARKET CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, WE MAY ALSO DELAY THE TIMING OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AS WELL AS LIMIT FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, REDUCE OUR OPERATING EXPENDITURES, OR RE-EVALUATE OUR DIVIDEND POLICY.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP FILED A UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION ON FORM S-3 ASR WITH THE SEC WHICH PROVIDED FOR THE REGISTRATION OF AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURITIES BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLETE ANY SUCH OFFERINGS OF DEBT SECURITIES.  FACTORS INFLUENCING THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL FINANCING INCLUDE INVESTOR PERCEPTION OF OUR PROSPECTS AND THE GENERAL CONDITION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, AMONG OTHERS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  CASH FLOWS  COMPARISON OF THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH WERE  $64.3 MILLION  AND  $65.2 MILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  DECREASED  $7.1 MILLION  TO  $36.8 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  $44.0 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN CASH FROM OPERATIONS WAS DUE TO HIGHER NON-CASH ITEMS AND CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $11.1 MILLION  TO  $22.4 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  $11.4 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  . THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AT WAIKELE CENTER AND REDEVELOPMENT AT LLOYD DISTRICT PORTFOLIO.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED  $52.0 MILLION  TO CASH USED OF  $7.4 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO CASH USED OF  $59.3 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN THE PAYOFF OF THE MORTGAGES AT LOMAS PALISADES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 COMPARED TO THE PAYOFF OF THE MORTGAGE AT TORREY RESERVE - NORTH COURT DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  NET OPERATING INCOME  NET OPERATING INCOME, OR NOI, IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE. WE DEFINE NOI AS OPERATING REVENUES (RENTAL INCOME, TENANT REIMBURSEMENTS, LEASE TERMINATION FEES, GROUND LEASE RENTAL INCOME AND OTHER PROPERTY INCOME) LESS PROPERTY AND RELATED EXPENSES (PROPERTY EXPENSES, GROUND LEASE EXPENSE, PROPERTY MARKETING COSTS, REAL ESTATE TAXES AND INSURANCE).  NOI EXCLUDES GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INTEREST EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, ACQUISITION-RELATED EXPENSE, OTHER NONPROPERTY INCOME AND LOSSES, GAINS AND LOSSES FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS, EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS, TENANT IMPROVEMENTS, AND LEASING COMMISSIONS.  OTHER REITS MAY USE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES FOR CALCULATING NOI, AND ACCORDINGLY, OUR NOI MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THE NOIS OF OTHER REITS.  NOI IS USED BY INVESTORS AND OUR MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPERTIES AND TO DETERMINE TRENDS IN EARNINGS AND TO COMPUTE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR PROPERTIES AS IT IS NOT AFFECTED BY (1) THE COST OF FUNDS OF THE PROPERTY OWNER, (2) THE IMPACT OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES AS WELL AS GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THE SALE OF OPERATING REAL ESTATE ASSETS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN NET INCOME COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP OR (3) GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND OTHER GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO THE PROPERTY OWNER. THE COST OF FUNDS IS ELIMINATED FROM NET INCOME BECAUSE IT IS SPECIFIC TO THE PARTICULAR FINANCING CAPABILITIES AND CONSTRAINTS OF THE OWNER. THE COST OF FUNDS IS ALSO ELIMINATED BECAUSE IT IS DEPENDENT ON HISTORICAL INTEREST RATES AND OTHER COSTS OF CAPITAL AS WELL AS PAST DECISIONS MADE BY US REGARDING THE APPROPRIATE MIX OF CAPITAL, WHICH MAY HAVE CHANGED OR MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES AS WELL AS GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THE SALE OF OPERATING REAL ESTATE ASSETS ARE ELIMINATED BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT ACCURATELY REPRESENT THE  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ACTUAL CHANGE IN VALUE IN OUR RETAIL, OFFICE, MULTIFAMILY OR MIXED-USE PROPERTIES THAT RESULT FROM USE OF THE PROPERTIES OR CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS. WHILE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF REAL PROPERTY DO DECLINE IN VALUE OVER TIME IN A MANNER THAT IS INTENDED TO BE CAPTURED BY DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTIES AS A WHOLE HAVE HISTORICALLY INCREASED OR DECREASED AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INSTEAD OF FROM ACTUAL USE OF THE PROPERTY OR THE PASSAGE OF TIME. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE SALE OF REAL PROPERTY VARY FROM PROPERTY TO PROPERTY AND ARE AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF SALE, WHICH WILL USUALLY CHANGE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. THESE GAINS AND LOSSES CAN CREATE DISTORTIONS WHEN COMPARING ONE PERIOD TO ANOTHER OR WHEN COMPARING OUR OPERATING RESULTS TO THE OPERATING RESULTS OF OTHER REAL ESTATE COMPANIES THAT HAVE NOT MADE SIMILARLY TIMED PURCHASES OR SALES. WE BELIEVE THAT ELIMINATING THESE COSTS FROM NET INCOME IS USEFUL BECAUSE THE RESULTING MEASURE CAPTURES THE ACTUAL REVENUE GENERATED AND ACTUAL EXPENSES INCURRED IN OPERATING OUR PROPERTIES AS WELL AS TRENDS IN OCCUPANCY RATES, RENTAL RATES AND OPERATING COSTS.  HOWEVER, THE USEFULNESS OF NOI IS LIMITED BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, INTEREST EXPENSE, INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTIES, AND OTHER GAINS AND LOSSES AS STIPULATED BY GAAP, THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASING COSTS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPERTIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC COSTS. NOI MAY FAIL TO CAPTURE SIGNIFICANT TRENDS IN THESE COMPONENTS OF NET INCOME, WHICH FURTHER LIMITS ITS USEFULNESS.  NOI IS A MEASURE OF THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPERTIES BUT DOES NOT MEASURE OUR PERFORMANCE AS A WHOLE. NOI IS THEREFORE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME AS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THIS MEASURE SHOULD BE ANALYZED IN CONJUNCTION WITH NET INCOME COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND DISCUSSIONS ELSEWHERE IN \u201cMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d REGARDING THE COMPONENTS OF NET INCOME THAT ARE ELIMINATED IN THE CALCULATION OF NOI. OTHER COMPANIES MAY USE DIFFERENT METHODS FOR CALCULATING NOI OR SIMILARLY ENTITLED MEASURES AND, ACCORDINGLY, OUR NOI MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY ENTITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES THAT DO NOT DEFINE THE MEASURE EXACTLY AS WE DO.  THE FOLLOWING IS A RECONCILIATION OF OUR NOI TO NET INCOME FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP (IN THOUSANDS).  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  NET OPERATING INCOME  $55,477  $51,766  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  (6,073  )  (5,567  )  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  (20,583  )  (33,279  )  INTEREST EXPENSE  (13,349  )  (13,820  )  OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET  (229  )  209  NET INCOME (LOSS)  $15,243  $(691  )  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS  WE CALCULATE FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, OR FFO, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, OR NAREIT. FFO REPRESENTS NET INCOME (COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP), EXCLUDING GAINS (OR LOSSES) FROM SALES OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTY, IMPAIRMENT LOSSES, REAL-ESTATE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS) AND AFTER ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES.  FFO IS A SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE. MANAGEMENT USES FFO AS A SUPPLEMENTAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE BECAUSE IT BELIEVES THAT FFO IS BENEFICIAL TO INVESTORS AS A STARTING POINT IN MEASURING OUR OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE. SPECIFICALLY, IN EXCLUDING REAL-ESTATE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND GAINS AND LOSSES FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS, WHICH DO NOT RELATE TO OR ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE, FFO PROVIDES A PERFORMANCE MEASURE THAT, WHEN COMPARED YEAR OVER YEAR, CAPTURES TRENDS IN OCCUPANCY RATES, RENTAL RATES AND OPERATING COSTS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT, AS A WIDELY RECOGNIZED MEASURE OF THE PERFORMANCE OF REITS, FFO WILL BE USED BY INVESTORS AS A BASIS TO COMPARE OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE WITH THAT OF OTHER REITS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE FFO EXCLUDES DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND CAPTURES NEITHER THE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF OUR PROPERTIES THAT RESULT FROM USE OR MARKET CONDITIONS NOR THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASING COMMISSIONS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPERTIES, ALL OF WHICH HAVE REAL ECONOMIC EFFECTS AND COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS, THE UTILITY OF FFO AS A MEASURE OF OUR PERFORMANCE IS LIMITED. IN ADDITION, OTHER EQUITY REITS MAY NOT CALCULATE FFO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NAREIT DEFINITION AS WE DO, AND, ACCORDINGLY, OUR FFO MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SUCH OTHER REITS' FFO. ACCORDINGLY, FFO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY AS A SUPPLEMENT TO NET INCOME AS A MEASURE OF OUR PERFORMANCE. FFO SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A MEASURE OF OUR LIQUIDITY, NOR IS IT INDICATIVE OF FUNDS AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR CASH  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NEEDS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS OR SERVICE INDEBTEDNESS. FFO ALSO SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO OR SUBSTITUTE FOR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. AS SUCH, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE BASED UPON  THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. WE ROUTINELY  EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. DURING  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS INHERENT IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A SUMMARY OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS CONTAINED  IN NOTE 1 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K  FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND  ANALYSIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1, OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM  10-Q.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMPARISON OF FIRST QUARTER 2019 AND FIRST QUARTER 2018  REVENUES  2019% OF REVENUE  2018% OF REVENUE  $ CHANGE% CHANGE  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  U.S. CORRECTIONS & DETENTION  $390,510  63.9%  $358,681  63.5%  $31,829  8.9%  GEO CARE  153,843  25.2%  140,078  24.8%  13,765  9.8%  INTERNATIONAL SERVICES  64,224  10.5%  66,158  11.7%  (1,934  )  (2.9)%  FACILITY CONSTRUCTION & DESIGN  2,090  0.3%  \u2014  \u2014%  2,090  \u2014%  TOTAL  $610,667  100.0%  $564,917  100.0%  $45,750  8.1%  U.S. CORRECTIONS & DETENTION  REVENUES INCREASED IN FIRST QUARTER 2019 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO AGGREGATE INCREASES OF $20.5 MILLION DUE TO AGGREGATE NET  INCREASES IN POPULATION WITH OUR FEDERAL CLIENTS, TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND/OR RATES. WE ALSO HAD INCREASES OF $14.7 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE ACTIVATION OF OUR CONTRACTS AT OUR COMPANY-OWNED EAGLE PASS DETENTION FACILITY IN EAGLE PASS,  TEXAS AND OUR COMPANY-OWNED MONTGOMERY PROCESSING CENTER IN CONROE, TEXAS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET DECREASES OF $3.4 MILLION AT CERTAIN OF OUR FACILITIES DUE TO CONTRACT TERMINATIONS.  THE NUMBER OF COMPENSATED MANDAYS IN U.S. CORRECTIONS & DETENTION FACILITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY 5.8 MILLION IN FIRST QUARTER 2019 AND  5.6 MILLION IN FIRST QUARTER 2018. WE EXPERIENCED AN AGGREGATE NET INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 200,000 MANDAYS AS A RESULT OF POPULATION INCREASES WITH OUR FEDERAL CLIENTS AND OUR CONTRACT ACTIVATIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE, OFFSET BY CONTRACT  TERMINATIONS. WE LOOK AT THE AVERAGE OCCUPANCY IN OUR FACILITIES TO DETERMINE HOW WE ARE MANAGING OUR AVAILABLE BEDS. THE AVERAGE OCCUPANCY IS CALCULATED BY TAKING COMPENSATED MANDAYS AS A PERCENTAGE OF CAPACITY. THE AVERAGE OCCUPANCY IN OUR U.S.  CORRECTIONS & DETENTION FACILITIES WAS 96.5% AND 94.0% OF CAPACITY IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2019 AND FIRST QUARTER 2018, RESPECTIVELY, EXCLUDING IDLE FACILITIES.  GEO CARE  REVENUES INCREASED IN FIRST QUARTER 2019  COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO AGGREGATE INCREASES OF $15.8 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN AVERAGE CLIENT AND PARTICIPANT COUNTS UNDER OUR ISAP AND ELECTRONIC MONITORING SERVICES AS WELL AS CENSUS LEVELS AT CERTAIN OF  OUR COMMUNITY-BASED AND REENTRY CENTERS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $2.0 MILLION RELATED TO CONTRACT TERMINATIONS/CLOSURES OF UNDERUTILIZED FACILITIES.  INTERNATIONAL SERVICES  REVENUES FOR INTERNATIONAL  SERVICES IN FIRST QUARTER 2019 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER 2018 DECREASED BY $1.9 MILLION. WE EXPERIENCED A NET INCREASE OF $5.1 MILLION IN PERFORMANCE WHICH WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR AUSTRALIAN SUBSIDIARY\u2019S RAVENHALL  CORRECTIONAL FACILITY PROJECT WHICH BEGAN OPERATIONS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017 AND CONTINUED TO RAMP UP IN 2018. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN REVENUE IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSITION OF OUR PARKLEA CORRECTIONAL CENTRE  TO A NEW OPERATOR IN MARCH 2019. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAD A DECREASE DUE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS OF $7.1 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES.  FACILITY CONSTRUCTION & DESIGN  BEGINNING IN THE  FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND INTO 2019, WE HAD FACILITY CONSTRUCTION & DESIGN SERVICES RELATED TO AN EXPANSION PROJECT AT OUR FULHAM CORRECTIONAL CENTRE IN AUSTRALIA WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020.

U.S. CORRECTIONS & DETENTION  OPERATING EXPENSES FOR U.S. CORRECTIONS & DETENTION INCREASED BY $22.0 MILLION IN FIRST QUARTER 2019 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER 2018. THE INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AGGREGATE NET INCREASES IN POPULATION, TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND THE VARIABLE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE SERVICES OF $15.9 MILLION. WE ALSO EXPERIENCED INCREASES OF $9.1 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE ACTIVATION OF OUR  CONTRACTS AT OUR COMPANY-OWNED EAGLE PASS DETENTION FACILITY IN EAGLE PASS, TEXAS AND OUR COMPANY-OWNED MONTGOMERY PROCESSING CENTER IN CONROE, TEXAS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES OF $3.0 MILLION AT CERTAIN OF OUR  FACILITIES PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTRACT TERMINATIONS.  GEO CARE  OPERATING EXPENSES FOR GEO CARE INCREASED BY $8.3 MILLION DURING FIRST QUARTER 2019 FROM FIRST QUARTER 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO $10.8 MILLION OF  INCREASES IN AVERAGE CLIENT AND PARTICIPANT COUNTS UNDER OUR ISAP AND ELECTRONIC MONITORING SERVICES AS WELL AS CENSUS LEVELS AT CERTAIN OF OUR COMMUNITY-BASED AND REENTRY CENTERS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES OF  $2.5 MILLION DUE TO NET DECREASES IN CENSUS LEVELS AT CERTAIN OF OUR COMMUNITY-BASED AND REENTRY CENTERS AS WELL AS CONTRACT TERMINATIONS/CLOSURES OF UNDERUTILIZED FACILITIES.  INTERNATIONAL SERVICES  OPERATING EXPENSES FOR  INTERNATIONAL SERVICES IN FIRST QUARTER 2019 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER 2018 DECREASED BY $2.1 MILLION. WE EXPERIENCED A NET INCREASE OF $4.3 MILLION PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR AUSTRALIAN SUBSIDIARY\u2019S RAVENHALL CORRECTIONAL FACILITY  PROJECT WHICH BEGAN OPERATIONS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017 AND CONTINUED TO RAMP UP IN 2018. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSITION OF OUR PARKLEA CORRECTIONAL CENTRE TO A NEW  OPERATOR IN MARCH 2019. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAD A DECREASE DUE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS OF $6.4 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES.  FACILITY CONSTRUCTION & DESIGN  BEGINNING IN THE  FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND INTO 2019, WE HAD FACILITY CONSTRUCTION & DESIGN SERVICES RELATED TO AN EXPANSION PROJECT AT OUR FULHAM CORRECTIONAL CENTRE IN AUSTRALIA WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020.

GEO CARE  GEO CARE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE  DECREASED IN FIRST QUARTER 2019 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN ASSETS BECOMING FULLY DEPRECIATED AND/OR AMORTIZED.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED IN FIRST QUARTER 2019 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER 2018. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES  RELATED TO HIGHER  NON-CASH  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $0.9 MILLION AS WELL AS NORMAL PERSONNEL AND COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS, PROFESSIONAL, CONSULTING, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN THE AGGREGATE OF $3.7 MILLION.

THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE COMPOSITION OF OUR INCOME. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THERE WAS A $0.5 MILLION DISCRETE TAX EXPENSE WHICH WAS $1.2 MILLION IN THE  FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 RELATED TO STOCK COMPENSATION THAT VESTED DURING THE RESPECTIVE PERIOD. AS A REIT, WE ARE REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE AT LEAST 90% OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME TO SHAREHOLDERS AND IN TURN ARE ALLOWED A DEDUCTION FOR THE DISTRIBUTION AT THE  REIT LEVEL. OUR WHOLLY-OWNED TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES CONTINUE TO BE FULLY SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES, AS APPLICABLE. WE ESTIMATE OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO BE IN THE RANGE OF APPROXIMATELY 9% TO 11% EXCLUSIVE OF ANY  DISCRETE ITEMS.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF AFFILIATES, NET OF INCOME TAX PROVISION  2019% OF  REVENUE  2018% OF  REVENUE  $ CHANGE% CHANGE  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF AFFILIATES  $2,596  0.4%  $1,995  0.4%  $601  30.1%  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF AFFILIATES, PRESENTED NET OF INCOME TAX PROVISION, REPRESENTS THE EARNINGS OF SACS AND GEOAMEY IN THE  AGGREGATE.

FINANCIAL CONDITION  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  OUR CURRENT CASH REQUIREMENTS CONSIST OF AMOUNTS NEEDED FOR WORKING CAPITAL, DISTRIBUTIONS OF OUR REIT TAXABLE INCOME IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR  REIT QUALIFICATION, DEBT SERVICE, SUPPLY PURCHASES, INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO EITHER THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW CORRECTIONAL, DETENTION AND REENTRY FACILITIES, OR THE MAINTENANCE OF EXISTING FACILITIES. IN  ADDITION, SOME OF OUR MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS REQUIRE US TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INITIAL EXPENDITURES OF CASH IN CONNECTION WITH OPENING OR RENOVATING A FACILITY. GENERALLY, THESE INITIAL EXPENDITURES ARE SUBSEQUENTLY FULLY OR PARTIALLY RECOVERABLE AS  PASS-THROUGH COSTS OR ARE BILLABLE AS A COMPONENT OF THE PER DIEM RATES OR MONTHLY FIXED FEES TO THE CONTRACTING AGENCY OVER THE ORIGINAL TERM OF THE CONTRACT.  WE CURRENTLY HAVE CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS FOR A NUMBER OF PROJECTS USING COMPANY FINANCING. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE COST OF THESE EXISTING CAPITAL PROJECTS WILL  BE APPROXIMATELY $218 MILLION OF WHICH $195 MILLION WAS SPENT THROUGH MARCH 31, 2019. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE REMAINING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THESE CAPITAL PROJECTS WILL BE $23 MILLION WHICH WILL BE SPENT THROUGH 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  INDEBTEDNESS  ON APRIL 30, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO  AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) BY AND AMONG THE REFINANCING LENDERS PARTY THERETO, THE OTHER LENDERS PARTY THERETO, GEO AND GEO CORRECTIONS HOLDINGS, INC. AND BNP PARIBAS, AS  ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. THE AMENDMENT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROVIDES FOR THE REFINANCING OF ALL OF GEO\u2019S EXISTING SENIOR SECURED TERM LOANS WITH REFINANCING TERM LOANS IN THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $792.0 MILLION AND MAKES CERTAIN  OTHER MODIFICATIONS TO GEO\u2019S SENIOR SECURED CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE INTEREST RATE APPLICABLE TO THE REFINANCING TERM LOANS IS EQUAL TO LIBOR PLUS 2.00% (WITH A LIBOR FLOOR OF 0.75%). THE AMENDMENT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A MODIFICATION AND LOAN  COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION WERE INCURRED AND CAPITALIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  $784 MILLION IN AGGREGATE BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING, NET OF DISCOUNT, UNDER THE TERM LOAN AND APPROXIMATELY $530 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVER, AND APPROXIMATELY $62 MILLION IN LETTERS OF CREDIT WHICH LEFT APPROXIMATELY  $308 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE REVOLVER. REFER TO NOTE 11 - DEBT OF THE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM  10-Q  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  IN CONNECTION WITH A DESIGN AND BUILD CORRECTIONAL FACILITY PROJECT AGREEMENT IN  RAVENHALL, AUSTRALIA WITH THE STATE OF VICTORIA, IN SEPTEMBER 2014, WE ENTERED INTO A SYNDICATED FACILITY AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCONSTRUCTION FACILITY\u201d) WITH NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LIMITED TO PROVIDE DEBT FINANCING FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE  PROJECT. THE PROJECT WAS COMPLETED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017. THE CONSTRUCTION FACILITY PROVIDED FOR  NON-RECOURSE  FUNDING UP TO AUD 791.0 MILLION, OR APPROXIMATELY $561.6 MILLION, BASED ON  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EXCHANGE RATES AS OF MARCH 31, 2019. THE TERM OF THE CONSTRUCTION FACILITY IS THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2019 AND BEARS INTEREST AT A VARIABLE RATE QUOTED BY CERTAIN AUSTRALIAN BANKS PLUS 200 BASIS  POINTS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REFINANCE THE CONSTRUCTION FACILITY PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 2019. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, APPROXIMATELY $318 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CONSTRUCTION FACILITY.  IN ADDITION TO THE DEBT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, THE 6.00% SENIOR NOTES, THE 5.125% SENIOR NOTES, THE 5.875.% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2022 AND THE 5.875% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2024, WE ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT DEBT OBLIGATIONS WHICH, ALTHOUGH THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE  NON-RECOURSE  TO  US, REQUIRE CASH EXPENDITURES FOR DEBT SERVICE. OUR SIGNIFICANT DEBT OBLIGATIONS COULD HAVE MATERIAL CONSEQUENCES. SEE \u201cRISK FACTORS-RISKS RELATED TO OUR HIGH LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS\u201d IN ITEM 1A OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K  FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. WE ARE EXPOSED TO VARIOUS COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. WE ALSO HAVE GUARANTEED CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS FOR  CERTAIN OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES. THESE  NON-RECOURSE  OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES ARE FURTHER DISCUSSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K  FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  REFER TO NOTE 11 - DEBT OF THE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM  10-Q  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS.  WE CONSIDER OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE BUSINESS AND/OR ASSET ACQUISITIONS AS WE DEEM APPROPRIATE WHEN MARKET CONDITIONS PRESENT OPPORTUNITIES. IF WE ARE  SUCCESSFUL IN OUR PURSUIT OF ANY NEW PROJECTS, OUR CASH ON HAND, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS UNDER THE EXISTING CREDIT FACILITY MAY NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR CAPITAL NEEDS AND WE COULD BE FORCED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL  FINANCING OR REFINANCE OUR EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH FINANCING OR REFINANCING WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO US ON TERMS EQUAL TO OR MORE FAVORABLE THAN OUR CURRENT FINANCING TERMS, OR AT ALL. IN THE FUTURE, OUR ACCESS TO  CAPITAL AND ABILITY TO COMPETE FOR FUTURE CAPITAL INTENSIVE PROJECTS WILL ALSO BE DEPENDENT UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR ABILITY TO MEET CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS IN THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE 5.125% SENIOR NOTES, THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE  5.875% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2022, THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE 5.875% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2024, THE INDENTURE GOVERNING THE 6.00% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2026 AND OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT. A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD LIMIT OUR ACCESS TO  CAPITAL PURSUANT TO THESE COVENANTS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AND, AS A RESULT, ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO THESE FOREGOING POTENTIAL CONSTRAINTS ON OUR  CAPITAL, A NUMBER OF STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES HAVE BEEN SUFFERING FROM BUDGET DEFICITS AND LIQUIDITY ISSUES. WHILE WE EXPECT TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR DEBT COVENANTS, IF THESE CONSTRAINTS WERE TO INTENSIFY, OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE MATERIALLY  ADVERSELY IMPACTED AS COULD OUR ABILITY TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE DEBT COVENANTS.  AS A REIT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONAL AND  OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING A REQUIREMENT THAT WE ANNUALLY DISTRIBUTE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO AT LEAST 90% OF OUR REIT TAXABLE INCOME (DETERMINED BEFORE THE DEDUCTION FOR DIVIDENDS PAID AND BY EXCLUDING ANY NET CAPITAL GAIN).  GENERALLY, WE EXPECT TO DISTRIBUTE ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REIT TAXABLE INCOME SO AS NOT TO BE SUBJECT TO THE INCOME OR EXCISE TAX ON UNDISTRIBUTED REIT TAXABLE INCOME. THE AMOUNT, TIMING AND FREQUENCY OF DISTRIBUTIONS WILL BE AT THE SOLE  DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD AND WILL BE BASED UPON VARIOUS FACTORS.  WE PLAN TO FUND ALL OF OUR CAPITAL NEEDS, INCLUDING DISTRIBUTIONS OF OUR REIT TAXABLE  INCOME IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR REIT QUALIFICATION, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FROM CASH ON HAND, CASH FROM OPERATIONS, BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY AND ANY OTHER FINANCINGS WHICH OUR MANAGEMENT AND BOARD, IN THEIR DISCRETION, MAY CONSUMMATE.  CURRENTLY, OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS IS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS UNDER THE $900.0 MILLION REVOLVER. OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT CASH ON HAND, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND AVAILABILITY UNDER  OUR CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR 2019 AS DISCLOSED UNDER \u201cCAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\u201d ABOVE.

THE CURRENT  AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED, PROVIDES FOR A LUMP SUM PAYMENT UPON RETIREMENT, NO SOONER THAN AGE 55. OUR CEO HAS REACHED AGE 55 AND IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE PAYMENT UPON RETIREMENT. IF OUR CEO HAD RETIRED AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO  PAY HIM APPROXIMATELY $8.6 MILLION. BASED ON OUR CURRENT CAPITALIZATION, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT MAKING THIS PAYMENT WOULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY.  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  EXCEPT AS DISCUSSED IN THE NOTES TO OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM  10-Q,  WE DO NOT HAVE ANY  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO GEO,  NON-CASH  EXPENSES SUCH AS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AMORTIZATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS, DISCOUNT AND/OR PREMIUM AND OTHER NON-CASH INTEREST, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF  AFFILIATES, NET OF TAX NEGATIVELY IMPACTED CASH. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS DECREASED IN TOTAL BY $27.5 MILLION, REPRESENTING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON CASH. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE TIMING OF  BILLINGS AND COLLECTIONS. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES DECREASED BY $14.8 MILLION WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED CASH. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, CASH PROVIDED BY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY A DECREASE IN CHANGES IN CONTRACT RECEIVABLE RELATED TO OUR CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IN RAVENHALL, AUSTRALIA OF $1.4 MILLION WHICH WAS A RESULT OF THE  TIMING OF INTEREST ACCRUALS AND PAYMENTS MADE TOWARDS THE CONTRACT RECEIVABLE.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018 WAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO GEO,  NON-CASH  EXPENSES SUCH AS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AMORTIZATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS, DISCOUNT AND/OR PREMIUM AND OTHER  NON-CASH INTEREST, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF AFFILIATES, NET OF TAX NEGATIVELY IMPACTED CASH.

ADDITIONALLY, CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WAS POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY A DECREASE IN CHANGES IN CONTRACT RECEIVABLE RELATED TO OUR PRISON PROJECT  IN RAVENHALL, AUSTRALIA OF $6.3 MILLION WHICH WAS A RESULT OF PAYMENTS MADE TOWARDS THE CONTRACT RECEIVABLE NOW THAT THE FACILITY IS IN OPERATION.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN INVESTING  ACTIVITIES OF $29.4 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $28.1 MILLION. CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $44.4 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $52.1 MILLION.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS APPROXIMATELY $30.7 MILLION COMPARED TO CASH USED IN FINANCING  ACTIVITIES OF $49.0 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF DIVIDENDS PAID OF $57.9 MILLION, PAYMENTS ON  LONG-TERM DEBT OF $96.9 MILLION AND PAYMENTS ON  NON-RECOURSE  DEBT OF $2.1 MILLION. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM LONG-TERM DEBT OF $130.0 MILLION. CASH USED IN FINANCING  ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF PROCEEDS FROM LONG-TERM DEBT OF $102.0 MILLION. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE FOR DIVIDENDS PAID OF $58.2 MILLION, PAYMENTS FOR  REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK OF $40.2 MILLION, PAYMENTS ON LONG-TERM DEBT OF $43.0 MILLION AND PAYMENTS ON  NON-RECOURSE  DEBT OF $5.6 MILLION.  46  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NON-GAAP  MEASURES  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cFFO\u201d) IS A WIDELY ACCEPTED SUPPLEMENTAL  NON-GAAP  MEASURE UTILIZED TO EVALUATE THE  OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS. IT IS DEFINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, OR NAREIT, WHICH DEFINES FFO AS NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON  SHAREHOLDERS (COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES), EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, EXCLUDING GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES, EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS AND  SALES OF PROPERTIES, AND INCLUDING ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES.  WE ALSO PRESENT NORMALIZED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, OR  NORMALIZED FFO, AND ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, OR AFFO, AS SUPPLEMENTAL  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS\u2019 OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  NORMALIZED FFO IS DEFINED AS FFO ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN ITEMS WHICH BY THEIR NATURE ARE NOT COMPARABLE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD OR THAT TEND TO OBSCURE THE  COMPANY\u2019S ACTUAL OPERATING PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED THE NET TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT IMPACT AND THE TAX EFFECT OF ADJUSTMENTS TO FFO.  AFFO IS DEFINED AS NORMALIZED FFO ADJUSTED BY ADDING  NON-CASH  EXPENSES SUCH AS  NON-REAL  ESTATE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, STOCK BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, THE AMORTIZATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS, DISCOUNT AND/OR PREMIUM AND OTHER  NON-CASH  INTEREST, AND BY SUBTRACTING RECURRING CONSOLIDATED MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  BECAUSE OF THE  UNIQUE DESIGN, STRUCTURE AND USE OF OUR CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES, WE BELIEVE THAT ASSESSING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES WITHOUT THE IMPACT OF DEPRECIATION OR AMORTIZATION IS USEFUL AND MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS. ALTHOUGH NAREIT HAS  PUBLISHED ITS DEFINITION OF FFO, COMPANIES OFTEN MODIFY THIS DEFINITION AS THEY SEEK TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT MEANINGFULLY REFLECT THEIR DISTINCTIVE OPERATIONS. WE HAVE MODIFIED FFO TO DERIVE NORMALIZED FFO AND AFFO THAT MEANINGFULLY  REFLECT OUR OPERATIONS.  OUR ASSESSMENT OF OUR OPERATIONS IS FOCUSED ON LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY. THE ADJUSTMENTS WE MAKE TO DERIVE THE  NON-GAAP  MEASURES OF NORMALIZED FFO AND AFFO EXCLUDE ITEMS WHICH MAY CAUSE SHORT-TERM FLUCTUATIONS IN NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO GEO BUT HAVE NO IMPACT ON OUR CASH FLOWS, OR WE DO NOT CONSIDER THEM TO BE FUNDAMENTAL  ATTRIBUTES OR THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND THEY DO NOT AFFECT OUR OVERALL LONG-TERM OPERATING PERFORMANCE. WE MAY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO FFO FROM TIME TO TIME FOR CERTAIN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES THAT DO NOT REFLECT A NECESSARY  COMPONENT OF OUR OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE ON THE BASIS DISCUSSED ABOVE, EVEN THOUGH SUCH ITEMS MAY REQUIRE CASH SETTLEMENT. BECAUSE FFO, NORMALIZED FFO AND AFFO EXCLUDE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION UNIQUE TO REAL ESTATE AS WELL AS  NON-OPERATIONAL  ITEMS AND CERTAIN OTHER CHARGES THAT ARE HIGHLY VARIABLE FROM YEAR TO YEAR, THEY PROVIDE OUR INVESTORS WITH PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT REFLECT THE IMPACT TO OPERATIONS FROM TRENDS IN OCCUPANCY RATES,  PER DIEM RATES, OPERATING COSTS AND INTEREST COSTS, PROVIDING A PERSPECTIVE NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT FROM NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO GEO.  WE BELIEVE THE  PRESENTATION OF FFO, NORMALIZED FFO AND AFFO PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS AS THEY PROVIDE AN INDICATION OF OUR ABILITY TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESS. FFO, NORMALIZED FFO AND AFFO PROVIDE DISCLOSURE ON THE SAME BASIS  AS THAT USED BY OUR MANAGEMENT AND PROVIDE CONSISTENCY IN OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING, FACILITATE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COMPARISONS OF OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OUR BUSINESS UNITS AND PROVIDE CONTINUITY TO INVESTORS FOR COMPARABILITY  PURPOSES. ADDITIONALLY, FFO, NORMALIZED FFO AND AFFO ARE WIDELY RECOGNIZED MEASURES IN OUR INDUSTRY AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST.  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GEO GROUP, INC.

WHILE STATE FINANCES OVERALL ARE STABLE, FUTURE BUDGETARY PRESSURES MAY CAUSE STATE CORRECTIONAL  AGENCIES TO PURSUE A NUMBER OF COST SAVINGS INITIATIVES WHICH MAY INCLUDE REDUCTIONS IN PER DIEM RATES AND/OR THE SCOPE OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY PRIVATE OPERATORS. THESE POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS INITIATIVES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR  CURRENT OPERATIONS AND/OR OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. ADDITIONALLY, IF STATE BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, PERSIST OR INTENSIFY, OUR STATE CUSTOMERS\u2019 ABILITY TO PAY US MAY BE IMPAIRED AND/OR WE MAY BE FORCED  TO RENEGOTIATE OUR MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS ON LESS FAVORABLE TERMS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACTED. WE PLAN TO ACTIVELY BID ON ANY NEW PROJECTS THAT FIT OUR TARGET PROFILE FOR  PROFITABILITY AND OPERATIONAL RISK. ALTHOUGH WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE OVERALL INDUSTRY OUTLOOK, POSITIVE TRENDS IN THE INDUSTRY MAY BE OFFSET BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS, CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS, CONTRACT TERMINATIONS, CONTRACT  NON-RENEWALS,  AND/OR CONTRACT  RE-BIDS  AND THE IMPACT OF ANY OTHER POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE WILLINGNESS TO MAINTAIN OR GROW PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS ON THE PART OF  OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR GOVERNMENT PARTNERS AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE OPERATE FACILITIES THAT MAXIMIZE SECURITY AND EFFICIENCY WHILE OFFERING OUR SUITE OF GEO CONTINUUM OF CARE SERVICES AND  RESOURCES.  ALTHOUGH WE HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD A RELATIVELY HIGH CONTRACT RENEWAL RATE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RENEW OUR  EXPIRING MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. ALSO, WHILE WE ARE PLEASED WITH OUR TRACK RECORD IN  RE-BID  SITUATIONS, WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT WE WILL PREVAIL IN ANY SUCH FUTURE SITUATIONS.  INTERNATIONALLY, WE ARE EXPLORING A NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR CURRENT MARKETS AND WILL CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY BID ON ANY OPPORTUNITIES THAT FIT OUR TARGET  PROFILE FOR PROFITABILITY AND OPERATIONAL RISK.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  IN APRIL, WE REPORTED FINAL RESULTS FROM THE PHASE 3 VITAL AMYLOIDOSIS STUDY OF NEOD001 (BIRTAMIMAB) IN NEWLY DIAGNOSED, TREATMENT NAI\u0308VE PATIENTS WITH AL AMYLOIDOSIS AND CARDIAC DYSFUNCTION (N=260), WHICH WAS DISCONTINUED IN 2018, AND THAT WE ARE EXPLORING POTENTIAL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO ADVANCE NEOD001. THE FINAL HAZARD RATIO (HR) FOR THE COMPOSITE PRIMARY ENDPOINT (TIME TO ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY OR TIME TO CARDIAC HOSPITALIZATION MORE THAN 90 DAYS AFTER FIRST INFUSION OF STUDY DRUG) OF 0.835 (95% CI: 0.5799, 1.2011; P=0.3300) WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE FUTILITY ANALYSIS REPORTED IN APRIL 2018. POST HOC ANALYSES OF ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY REVEALED A POTENTIAL SURVIVAL BENEFIT FAVORING NEOD001 IN THE CATEGORY OF PATIENTS AT HIGHEST RISK FOR EARLY MORTALITY (MAYO STAGE IV, N=77) WITH A HR OF 0.544 (95% CI: 0.2738, 1.0826; P=0.0787).

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  OUR R&D EXPENSE DECREASED BY  $21.4 MILLION  , OR  62%  , FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CLINICAL COSTS ASSOCIATED PRIMARILY WITH THE DISCONTINUATION OF THE NEOD001 PROGRAM, LOWER CONSULTING EXPENSE, LOWER PERSONNEL COSTS (INCLUDING SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE) AND LOWER MANUFACTURING COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISCONTINUATION OF THE NEOD001 PROGRAM.  OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ARE AIMED AT DEVELOPING NEW DRUG PRODUCTS. OUR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES INVOLVE THE TRANSLATION OF OUR RESEARCH INTO POTENTIAL NEW DRUGS. R&D EXPENSES INCLUDE PERSONNEL COSTS AND RELATED EXPENSES, EXTERNAL EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH NONCLINICAL AND DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND MATERIALS, EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES COSTS THAT ARE ALLOCATED TO CLEARLY RELATED R&D ACTIVITIES.

EXPENDITURES IN THE EARLY DISCOVERY STAGE ARE NOT TRACKED BY PROGRAM AND ACCORDINGLY HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THIS CUMULATIVE AMOUNT. IN APRIL 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WERE DISCONTINUING DEVELOPMENT OF NEOD001. SINCE THAT DATE WE HAVE INCURRED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSE OUT OF OUR PHASE 2B PRONTO, PHASE 3 VITAL AS WELL AS THE OPEN LABEL EXTENSION STUDIES OF NEOD001.  (2)  CUMULATIVE R&D COSTS TO DATE FOR PRASINEZUMAB AND RELATED ANTIBODIES INCLUDE THE COSTS INCURRED FROM THE DATE WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS SEPARATELY TRACKED IN NONCLINICAL DEVELOPMENT.

(3)  CUMULATIVE R&D COSTS TO DATE FOR PRX003 INCLUDE THE COSTS INCURRED FROM THE DATE WHEN THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN SEPARATELY TRACKED IN NONCLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. EXPENDITURES IN THE EARLY DISCOVERY STAGE ARE NOT TRACKED BY PROGRAM AND ACCORDINGLY HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THIS CUMULATIVE AMOUNT. BASED ON THE PHASE 1B MULTIPLE ASCENDING DOSE STUDY RESULTS ANNOUNCED IN SEPTEMBER 2017, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WILL NOT ADVANCE PRX003 INTO MID-STAGE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT FOR PSORIASIS OR PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS AS PREVIOUSLY PLANNED.

(5)  OTHER R&D IS COMPRISED OF PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT AND DISCOVERY PROGRAMS THAT HAVE NOT PROGRESSED TO FIRST PATIENT DOSING IN A PHASE 1 CLINICAL TRIAL.  AS A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING AND THE DISCONTINUATION OF NEOD001 PROGRAM IN 2018, WE EXPECT OUR R&D EXPENSES TO DECREASE IN 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  OUR G&A EXPENSES DECREASED BY  $4.3 MILLION  , OR  30%  , FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PERSONNEL COSTS (INCLUDING SHARE BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE) AND LOWER CONSULTING EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF THE DISCONTINUATION OF THE NEOD001 PROGRAM.  AS A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING IN 2018, WE EXPECT OUR G&A EXPENSES TO DECREASE IN 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT RELATED CHARGES  IN MAY 2018, WE COMMENCED A REORGANIZATION PLAN TO REDUCE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND BETTER ALIGN OUR WORKFORCE WITH THE NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESS FOLLOWING OUR DECISION IN APRIL 2018 TO DISCONTINUE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF NEOD001. FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECORDED A RESTRUCTURING CREDIT OF APPROXIMATELY  $61,000  PRIMARILY DUE TO AN ADJUSTMENT IN PREVIOUSLY RECORDED EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS.

THE INCREASE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST INCOME IN OUR CASH AND MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS AND NO RECORDED INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUILD-TO-SUIT ACCOUNTING UPON THE ADOPTION OF ASC 842 IN 2019.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND 2018 WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES FROM TRANSACTIONS WITH VENDORS DENOMINATED IN EUROS.

THE CHANGE IN PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN TAX SHORTFALL RELATED TO OPTIONS CANCELLATION IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  . OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN STOCK PRICE BETWEEN THE GRANT DATES AND THE EXERCISE OR CANCELLATION DATES OF STOCK OPTIONS.  THE TAX PROVISIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED REFLECT U.S. FEDERAL TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH RECURRING PROFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INTERCOMPANY SERVICES THAT OUR U.S. SUBSIDIARY PERFORMS FOR THE COMPANY. NO TAX BENEFIT HAS BEEN RECORDED RELATED TO TAX LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN IRELAND AND ANY DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR THOSE LOSSES ARE OFFSET BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

THIS DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH USE OF  $23.1 MILLION  FOR OPERATING EXPENSES (ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE NON-CASH CHARGES).  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  $410.1 MILLION  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE, BASED ON OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PLANS, THAT OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR DRUG CANDIDATES. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  $108.3 MILLION  OF OUR OUTSTANDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS RELATED TO U.S. OPERATIONS ARE CONSIDERED PERMANENTLY REINVESTED.  WE DO NOT INTEND TO REPATRIATE THESE FUNDS.  HOWEVER, IF THESE FUNDS WERE REPATRIATED BACK TO IRELAND WE WOULD INCUR A WITHHOLDING TAX FROM THE DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION.  29  WE HAVE BASED THIS ESTIMATE ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY PROVE TO BE WRONG, AND WE COULD USE OUR AVAILABLE CAPITAL RESOURCES SOONER THAN WE CURRENTLY EXPECT. BECAUSE OF THE NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES, WE ARE UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNTS OF INCREASED CAPITAL OUTLAYS AND OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLETING THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES. OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE TIMING OF INITIATION, PROGRESS, RESULTS AND COSTS OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS; THE RESULTS OF OUR RESEARCH AND NONCLINICAL STUDIES; THE COSTS OF CLINICAL MANUFACTURING AND OF ESTABLISHING COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING ARRANGEMENTS; THE COSTS OF PREPARING, FILING AND PROSECUTING PATENT APPLICATIONS AND MAINTAINING, ENFORCING AND DEFENDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED CLAIMS; THE COSTS AND TIMING OF CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES; OUR ABILITY TO ESTABLISH RESEARCH COLLABORATIONS, STRATEGIC COLLABORATIONS, LICENSING OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS; THE COSTS TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER CURRENT AND POTENTIAL FUTURE COLLABORATIONS; THE COSTS OF ANY IN-LICENSING TRANSACTIONS; AND THE TIMING, RECEIPT, AND AMOUNT OF REVENUES OR ROYALTIES, IF ANY, FROM ANY APPROVED DRUG CANDIDATES. PURSUANT TO THE LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH ROCHE, IN THE U.S., WE AND ROCHE SHARE ALL DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION COSTS, AS WELL AS PROFITS, ALL OF WHICH WILL BE ALLOCATED 70% TO ROCHE AND 30% TO US, FOR PRASINEZUMAB, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER LICENSED PRODUCTS AND/OR INDICATIONS FOR WHICH WE OPT IN TO CO-DEVELOP AND CO-FUND. PURSUANT TO THE COLLABORATION AGREEMENT WITH CELGENE THE COMPANY IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS FOR COMMERCIAL AND REGULATORY MILESTONES AND ROYALTIES ON NET SALES OF COLLABORATION PRODUCTS. IN ORDER TO DEVELOP AND OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR OUR POTENTIAL PRODUCTS WE WILL NEED TO RAISE SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL FUNDS. WE EXPECT TO RAISE ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCINGS, COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS WITH CORPORATE PARTNERS OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS. WE CANNOT ASSUME THAT SUCH ADDITIONAL FINANCINGS WILL BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL, AND SUCH FINANCINGS MAY ONLY BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS DILUTIVE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.

(\u201cAXT\u201d, \u201cTHE COMPANY\u201d, \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cUS,\u201d AND \u201cOUR\u201d REFER TO AXT, INC. AND ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES) IS A WORLDWIDE MATERIALS SCIENCE COMPANY THAT DEVELOPS AND PRODUCES HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPOUND AND SINGLE ELEMENT SEMICONDUCTOR SUBSTRATES, ALSO KNOWN AS WAFERS. OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES PRODUCE AND SELL CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS SOME OF WHICH ARE USED IN OUR SUBSTRATE MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND SOME OF WHICH ARE SOLD TO OTHER COMPANIES.  OUR SUBSTRATE WAFERS ARE USED WHEN A TYPICAL SILICON SUBSTRATE WAFER CANNOT MEET THE PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS OF A SEMICONDUCTOR OR OPTOELECTRONIC DEVICE. THE DOMINANT SUBSTRATES USED IN PRODUCING SEMICONDUCTOR CHIPS AND OTHER ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS ARE MADE FROM SILICON. HOWEVER, CERTAIN CHIPS MAY BECOME TOO HOT OR PERFORM THEIR FUNCTION TOO SLOWLY IF SILICON IS USED AS THE BASE MATERIAL.  IN ADDITION, OPTOELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS LED LIGHTING AND CHIP-BASED LASERS, DO NOT USE SILICON SUBSTRATES BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE A WAVE FORM FREQUENCY THAT CANNOT BE ACHIEVED USING SILICON. ALTERNATIVE OR SPECIALTY MATERIALS ARE USED TO REPLACE SILICON AS THE PREFERRED BASE IN THESE SITUATIONS. OUR WAFERS PROVIDE SUCH ALTERNATIVE OR SPECIALTY MATERIALS. WE DO NOT DESIGN OR MANUFACTURE THE CHIPS. WE ADD VALUE BY RESEARCHING, DEVELOPING AND PRODUCING THE SPECIALTY MATERIAL WAFERS. WE HAVE TWO PRODUCT LINES: SPECIALTY MATERIAL SUBSTRATES AND RAW MATERIALS INTEGRAL TO THESE SUBSTRATES. OUR COMPOUND SUBSTRATES COMBINE INDIUM WITH PHOSPHOROUS (INDIUM PHOSPHIDE: INP) OR GALLIUM WITH ARSENIC (GALLIUM ARSENIDE: GAAS). OUR SINGLE ELEMENT SUBSTRATES ARE MADE FROM GERMANIUM (GE).  SEMI-INSULATING GAAS IS USED TO CREATE VARIOUS HIGH SPEED MICROWAVE COMPONENTS, INCLUDING POWER AMPLIFIER CHIPS USED IN CELL PHONES, SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS AND BROADCAST TELEVISION APPLICATIONS.  SEMI-CONDUCTING GAAS SUBSTRATES ARE USED TO CREATE OPTO-ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS, INCLUDING HIGH BRIGHTNESS LIGHT EMITTING DIODES (HBLEDS) THAT ARE OFTEN USED TO BACKLIGHT WIRELESS HANDSETS AND LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY (LCD) TVS AND ALSO USED FOR AUTOMOTIVE PANELS, SIGNAGE, DISPLAY AND LIGHTING APPLICATIONS. A POSSIBLE NEW APPLICATION FOR SEMI-CONDUCTING GAAS IS 3-D SENSING CHIPS USING VCSELS (VERTICAL CAVITY SURFACE EMITTING LASERS) AS AN ARRAY OF LASERS ON A SINGLE CHIP THAT COULD BE USED IN CELL PHONES AND OTHER DEVICES. INP IS A HIGH PERFORMANCE SEMICONDUCTOR SUBSTRATE USED IN BROADBAND AND FIBER OPTIC APPLICATIONS AND DATA CENTER CONNECTIVITY. IN RECENT YEARS, INP DEMAND HAS INCREASED. GE SUBSTRATES ARE USED IN APPLICATIONS SUCH AS SOLAR CELLS FOR SPACE AND TERRESTRIAL PHOTOVOLTAIC APPLICATIONS.  OUR RAW MATERIALS INCLUDE BOTH RAW GALLIUM AND PURIFIED GALLIUM.  WE USE PURIFIED GALLIUM IN PRODUCING OUR GAAS SUBSTRATES AND SELL BOTH RAW GALLIUM AND PURIFIED GALLIUM IN THE OPEN MARKET TO OTHER COMPANIES FOR USE IN PRODUCING MAGNETIC MATERIALS, HIGH TEMPERATURE THERMOMETERS, SINGLE CRYSTAL INGOTS INCLUDING GALLIUM ARSENIDE, GALLIUM NITRIDE, GALLIUM ANTIMONIDE, GALLIUM PHOSPHIDE, AND OTHER MATERIALS AND ALLOYS.  WE ALSO PRODUCE PYROLYTIC BORON NITRIDE (PBN) CRUCIBLES USED IN THE HIGH TEMPERATURE (TYPICALLY IN THE RANGE 500 C TO 1,500 C) GROWTH PROCESS OF SINGLE CRYSTAL INGOTS AND EPITAXIAL LAYER GROWTH IN MBE (MOLECULAR BEAM EPITAXY) REACTORS.  WE USE THESE PBN CRUCIBLES IN OUR OWN INGOT GROWTH PROCESSES AND ALSO SELL THEM IN THE OPEN MARKET TO OTHER COMPANIES. OUR SUBSTRATE PRODUCT GROUP GENERATED 79%, 80% AND 81% OF OUR REVENUE AND OUR RAW MATERIALS PRODUCT GROUP GENERATED 21%, 20% AND 19% FOR 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING CHART SHOWS OUR SUBSTRATE PRODUCTS AND THEIR MATERIALS, DIAMETERS AND ILLUSTRATIVE APPLICATIONS AND SHOWS OUR RAW MATERIALS GROUP PRIMARY PRODUCTS AND THEIR ILLUSTRATIVE USES AND APPLICATIONS.

OUR SUPPLY CHAIN INCLUDES PARTIAL OWNERSHIP OF 7 COMPANIES IN CHINA (SUBSIDIARIES/JOINT VENTURES). WE BELIEVE THIS SUPPLY CHAIN ARRANGEMENT PROVIDES US WITH PRICING ADVANTAGES, RELIABLE SUPPLY, MARKET TREND VISIBILITY AND BETTER SOURCING LEAD-TIMES FOR KEY RAW MATERIALS CENTRAL TO MANUFACTURING OUR SUBSTRATES. OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURE COMPANIES PRODUCE MATERIALS, INCLUDING RAW GALLIUM (4N GA), HIGH PURITY GALLIUM (6N GA), ARSENIC, GERMANIUM, GERMANIUM DIOXIDE, PYROLYTIC BORON NITRIDE (PBN) CRUCIBLES AND BORON OXIDE (B2O3). OUR OWNERSHIP AND THE OWNERSHIP HELD BY OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES IN THESE COMPANIES RANGE FROM 97% TO 20%. WE HAVE BOARD REPRESENTATION IN ALL 7 OF THESE COMPANIES. WE CONSOLIDATE THE COMPANIES IN WHICH WE HAVE EITHER A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST, OR MAJORITY FINANCIAL INTEREST COMBINED WITH THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SUBSTANTIVE CONTROL OVER THE OPERATION OR FINANCIAL DECISIONS MADE BY SUCH COMPANIES. WE USE THE EQUITY METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR COMPANIES IN WHICH WE HAVE SMALLER FINANCIAL INTEREST AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER SUCH COMPANIES. WE PURCHASE PORTIONS OF THE MATERIALS PRODUCED BY THESE COMPANIES FOR OUR OWN USE AND THEY SELL THE REMAINDER OF THEIR PRODUCTION TO THIRD PARTIES.  THE BEIJING CITY GOVERNMENT IS MOVING ITS OFFICES INTO THE AREA WHERE OUR ORIGINAL MANUFACTURING FACILITY IS CURRENTLY LOCATED AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING THOUSANDS OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES INTO THIS AREA. THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONSTRUCTED SHOWCASE TOWER BUILDINGS AND OVERSEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW APARTMENT COMPLEXES, RETAIL STORES AND RESTAURANTS. AN AMUSEMENT PARK IS BEING CONSTRUCTED WITHIN A FEW MILES OF OUR FACILITY. TO CREATE ROOM AND UPGRADE THE DISTRICT, THE CITY INSTRUCTED VIRTUALLY ALL EXISTING MANUFACTURING COMPANIES, INCLUDING AXT, TO RELOCATE ALL OR SOME OF THEIR MANUFACTURING LINES. IN 2018, WE ACHIEVED EVERY MAJOR MILESTONE ESTABLISHED IN OUR RELOCATION PLAN FOR OUR GALLIUM ARSENIDE AND GERMANIUM PRODUCTION LINES. WE INTEND TO SECURE ADDITIONAL PERMITS AND APPROVALS IN 2019. THE NEW FACILITIES ARE INTENDED TO GIVE US THE LONG-TERM CAPACITY AND A NEW LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGICAL SOPHISTICATION IN OUR MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES TO SUPPORT THE MAJOR TRENDS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE LIKELY TO DRIVE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN THE YEARS AHEAD. OUR INDIUM PHOSPHIDE PRODUCTION LINE, AS WELL AS VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE AND SALES FUNCTIONS, WILL REMAIN PRIMARILY AT OUR ORIGINAL SITE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  TO MITIGATE OUR RISKS AND MAINTAIN OUR PRODUCTION SCHEDULE, WE ARE MOVING OUR GALLIUM ARSENIDE EQUIPMENT IN STAGES SO THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE OUR GALLIUM ARSENIDE PRODUCTS AT OUR BEIJING SITE, AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSFER INCREASING VOLUME TO THE NEW SITES. THIS APPROACH WILL ALSO MINIMIZE ANY DISRUPTION TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE INTEND TO COMPLETE THIS RELOCATION IN 2019. IN 2018, WE PROVIDED QUALIFICATION WAFERS AND OUR OWN INTERNAL CHARACTERIZATION DATA FROM THE NEW FACILITIES TO OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF QUALIFYING THE WAFER SUBSTRATES BEFORE PLACING VOLUME PURCHASE ORDERS FOR PRODUCTS FROM THE NEW FACILITIES. THE RELOCATION OF OUR GALLIUM ARSENIDE PRODUCTION LINE REQUIRES US TO CONTINUE TO ACCURATELY EXECUTE OUR RELOCATION PLAN. A FAILURE TO PROPERLY COMPLETE OUR RELOCATION PLAN COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTION TO OUR PRODUCTION AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IF WE FAIL TO MEET THE PRODUCT QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS OF A CUSTOMER, WE MAY LOSE SALES TO THAT CUSTOMER. OUR REPUTATION MAY ALSO BE DAMAGED. ANY LOSS OF SALES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2018, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED A LIST OF THOUSANDS OF CATEGORIES OF GOODS THAT WILL FACE TARIFFS OF 10%.  ALL OF OUR WAFER SUBSTRATES ARE MANUFACTURED IN CHINA AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, APPROXIMATELY 14% OF OUR REVENUE WAS GENERATED BY SALES TO CUSTOMERS IN NORTH AMERICA, PRIMARILY IN THE U.S.  OUR INBOUND PRODUCTS TO THE U.S. ARE NOW SUBJECT TO A 10% TARIFF ASSESSED ON THE CUSTOMS VALUE OF THE GOODS AS IMPORTED BY US, EFFECTIVE APPROXIMATELY SEPTEMBER 24, 2018.  ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE INITIAL IMPACT OF APPROXIMATELY $150,000 PER QUARTER IS MATERIAL, THE FUTURE IMPACT OF TARIFFS AND TRADE WARS IS UNCERTAIN.  THE TARIFFS COULD BE INCREASED TO 25% SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE.  WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RAISE PRICES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF CUSTOMERS AND OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIALLY HARMED.  ADDITIONALLY, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO SIGNAL THAT IT MAY ALTER TRADE AGREEMENTS AND TERMS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING LIMITING TRADE WITH CHINA, AND MAY IMPOSE ADDITIONAL TARIFFS ON IMPORTS FROM CHINA.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  WE PREPARE OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAKE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON OUR RESULTS CANNOT BE DETERMINED WITH CERTAINTY, AND ARE MADE BASED UPON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THESE ESTIMATES MAY CHANGE AS NEW EVENTS OCCUR OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS OBTAINED, AND WE MAY PERIODICALLY BE FACED WITH UNCERTAINTIES, THE OUTCOMES OF WHICH ARE NOT WITHIN OUR CONTROL AND MAY NOT BE KNOWN FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME.  WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE POLICIES BELOW AS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MATERIAL TO THE PRESENTATION OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REQUIRE US TO MAKE DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL REPORTS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THEY MAY REQUIRE US TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME OF THE ESTIMATE. DIFFERENT ESTIMATES THAT WE COULD HAVE USED, OR CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATE THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR, MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  WE MANUFACTURE AND SELL HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTOR SUBSTRATES INCLUDING INDIUM PHOSPHIDE, GALLIUM ARSENIDE AND GERMANIUM WAFERS, AND OUR THREE CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES SELL CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS, INCLUDING 99.99% PURE GALLIUM (4N GA), HIGH PURITY GALLIUM (7N GA), PYROLYTIC BORON NITRIDE (PBN) CRUCIBLES AND BORON OXIDE (B2O3). AFTER WE SHIP OUR PRODUCTS, THERE ARE NO REMAINING OBLIGATIONS OR CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD PRECLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION. OUR PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY SOLD PURSUANT TO PURCHASE ORDERS PLACED BY OUR CUSTOMERS, AND OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE DO NOT REQUIRE CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE. WE ACCOUNT FOR A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER WHEN THERE IS A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT, WHICH COULD BE THE CUSTOMER\u2019S PURCHASE ORDER, THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES ARE IDENTIFIED, THE CONTRACT HAS COMMERCIAL TERMS, AND COLLECTIBILITY OF THE CONTRACT CONSIDERATION IS PROBABLE. THE MAJORITY OF OUR CONTRACTS HAVE A SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION TO TRANSFER PRODUCTS AND ARE SHORT TERM IN NATURE, USUALLY LESS THAN SIX MONTHS. OUR REVENUE IS MEASURED BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION SPECIFIED IN THE CONTRACT WITH EACH CUSTOMER IN EXCHANGE FOR TRANSFERRING PRODUCTS THAT ARE GENERALLY BASED UPON A NEGOTIATED, FORMULA, LIST OR FIXED PRICE. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PROMISED GOODS IS TRANSFERRED TO OUR CUSTOMER, WHICH IS EITHER UPON SHIPMENT FROM OUR DOCK, RECEIPT AT THE CUSTOMER\u2019S DOCK, OR REMOVAL FROM CONSIGNMENT INVENTORY AT THE CUSTOMER\u2019S LOCATION, IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE RECORDED AT THE INVOICED AMOUNT AND ARE NOT INTEREST BEARING. WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW THE LIKELIHOOD OF COLLECTION ON OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES AND PROVIDE AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PRIMARILY BASED UPON THE AGE OF THESE ACCOUNTS. WE EVALUATE RECEIVABLES FROM U.S. CUSTOMERS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON BALANCES IN EXCESS OF 90 DAYS AND FOR RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE U.S. WITH AN EMPHASIS ON BALANCES IN EXCESS OF 120 DAYS AND ESTABLISH A RESERVE ALLOWANCE ON THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES IF NEEDED. THE REASON FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN THE EVALUATION OF RECEIVABLES BETWEEN FOREIGN AND U.S. CUSTOMERS IS THAT U.S. CUSTOMERS HAVE HISTORICALLY MADE PAYMENTS IN A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME THAN FOREIGN CUSTOMERS. FOREIGN BUSINESS PRACTICES GENERALLY REQUIRE US TO ALLOW CUSTOMER PAYMENT TERMS THAT ARE LONGER THAN THOSE ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. WE ASSESS THE PROBABILITY OF COLLECTION BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME A RECEIVABLE BALANCE HAS BEEN OUTSTANDING, OUR PAST HISTORY WITH THE CUSTOMER AND THEIR CREDIT-WORTHINESS.  WE EXERCISE JUDGMENT WHEN DETERMINING THE ADEQUACY OF OUR RESERVES AS WE EVALUATE HISTORICAL BAD DEBT TRENDS, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND INTERNATIONALLY, AND CHANGES IN CUSTOMER FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES ARE RECORDED AS BAD DEBT EXPENSE WHEN ALL EFFORTS TO COLLECT HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED AND RECOVERIES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THEY ARE RECEIVED. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET BALANCE WAS $19.6 MILLION AND $19.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS OF $34,000 AND $358,000, RESPECTIVELY. IF ACTUAL UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WOULD BE REQUIRED, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FUTURE PERIODS.  HISTORICALLY, OUR ALLOWANCE FOR SALES RETURNS RESERVE WAS DEDUCTED FROM GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. UPON ADOPTION, ON JANUARY 1, 2018, OF THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE, ASC TOPIC 606, WE RECLASSIFIED OUR SALES RETURNS  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESERVE TO ACCRUED LIABILITIES. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE BALANCE WAS $60,000 AND $47,000, RESPECTIVELY.  WARRANTY RESERVE  WE MAINTAIN A PRODUCT WARRANTY BASED UPON OUR CLAIMS EXPERIENCE DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS AND ANY PENDING CLAIMS AND RETURNS OF WHICH WE ARE AWARE. WARRANTY COSTS ARE ACCRUED AT THE TIME REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, ACCRUED PRODUCT WARRANTIES TOTALED $325,000 AND $236,000, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN ACCRUED PRODUCT WARRANTIES IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED CLAIMS FOR QUALITY ISSUES EXPERIENCED BY CUSTOMERS. IF ACTUAL WARRANTY COSTS OR PENDING NEW CLAIMS DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITY WOULD BE REQUIRED, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FUTURE PERIODS.  INVENTORY VALUATION  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (APPROXIMATED BY STANDARD COST) OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. COST IS DETERMINED USING THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST METHOD. OUR INVENTORY CONSISTS OF RAW MATERIALS AS WELL AS FINISHED GOODS AND WORK IN PROCESS THAT INCLUDE MATERIAL, LABOR AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD COSTS. WE ROUTINELY EVALUATE THE LEVELS OF OUR INVENTORY IN LIGHT OF CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY, AND WE PROVIDE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN INVENTORIES BASED UPON THE AGE AND QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT AND THE PROJECTIONS FOR SALE OF THE COMPLETED PRODUCTS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAD AN INVENTORY RESERVE OF $15.6 MILLION AND $14.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY AND $123,000 AND $18,000, RESPECTIVELY, FOR LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE RESERVES. IF ACTUAL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS WERE TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN ESTIMATED, ADDITIONAL INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS FOR EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY MIGHT BE REQUIRED, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS  WE CLASSIFY MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC TOPIC 320, INVESTMENTS - DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. ALL AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES WITH A QUOTED MARKET VALUE BELOW COST (OR ADJUSTED COST) ARE REVIEWED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DECLINE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS IS TEMPORARY INCLUDE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE, THE LENGTH OF TIME THE MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW COST (OR ADJUSTED COST), CREDIT QUALITY, AND OUR ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITIES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE.  WE ALSO INVEST IN EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF PRIVATELY-HELD COMPANIES IN CHINA FOR BUSINESS AND STRATEGIC PURPOSES. INVESTMENTS IN OUR UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE COMPANIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS OTHER ASSETS AND ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER EITHER THE EQUITY OR COST METHOD, DEPENDING ON WHETHER WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THEIR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL DECISIONS. WE MONITOR OUR INVESTMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT AND RECORD REDUCTIONS IN CARRYING VALUE WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. DETERMINATION OF IMPAIRMENT IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING AN ASSESSMENT OF THE STRENGTH OF EACH COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT, THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN OUR COST BASIS, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANY, FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO THE BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANY, SHARE PRICES OF SUBSEQUENT OFFERINGS, AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN OUR CARRYING VALUE.  WE HAVE 25% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN A GERMANIUM MATERIALS COMPANY IN CHINA AND WE INCURRED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR THE PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  AFTER RECEIVING SUCH COMPANY\u2019S PRELIMINARY FIRST QUARTER 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS IN EARLY APRIL 2019 AND ITS PROJECTIONS FOR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES GOING FORWARD, WE DETERMINED THAT THIS ASSET WAS FULLY IMPAIRED AND WROTE THE ASSET BALANCE DOWN TO ZERO.  THIS RESULTED IN A $1.1 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN OUR FIRST QUARTER 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS. THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS  ASC 820, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES ESTABLISHES THREE LEVELS OF INPUTS THAT MAY BE USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE.  LEVEL 1 INSTRUMENTS REPRESENT QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS. THEREFORE, DETERMINING FAIR VALUE FOR LEVEL 1 INSTRUMENTS DOES NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT, AND THE ESTIMATION IS NOT DIFFICULT.  LEVEL 2 INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE OBSERVABLE INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 PRICES, SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS IN MARKETS WITH INSUFFICIENT VOLUME OR INFREQUENT TRANSACTIONS (LESS ACTIVE MARKETS), ISSUER BANK STATEMENTS, CREDIT RATINGS, NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT CAN BE CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA, MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS IN WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES, OR QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. THESE LEVEL 2 INSTRUMENTS REQUIRE MORE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND SUBJECTIVITY COMPARED TO LEVEL 1 INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING.  \u00b7  DETERMINING WHICH INSTRUMENTS ARE MOST SIMILAR TO THE INSTRUMENT BEING PRICED REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO IDENTIFY A SAMPLE OF SIMILAR SECURITIES BASED ON THE COUPON RATES, MATURITY, ISSUER, CREDIT RATING, AND INSTRUMENT TYPE, AND SUBJECTIVELY SELECT AN INDIVIDUAL SECURITY OR MULTIPLE SECURITIES THAT ARE DEEMED MOST SIMILAR TO THE SECURITY BEING PRICED.  \u00b7  DETERMINING WHICH MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS TO USE IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. WHEN OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES FOR IDENTICAL SECURITIES OR SIMILAR SECURITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE, WE PRICE OUR MARKETABLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS USING NON-BINDING MARKET CONSENSUS PRICES THAT ARE CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA OR PRICING MODELS, SUCH AS DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS, WITH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED WITH OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.  LEVEL 3 INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE FOR LEVEL 3 INSTRUMENTS REQUIRES THE MOST MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND SUBJECTIVITY.  WE PLACE SHORT-TERM FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES THAT ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET THE POTENTIAL CASH EXPOSURE RELATED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR AND JAPANESE YEN. WE MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES AT EACH MONTH END AND QUARTER END USING CURRENT EXCHANGE RATES AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. AT QUARTER END ANY FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES NOT SETTLED ARE NETTED IN \u201cACCRUED LIABILITIES\u201d ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3 ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 THE NET CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE FROM THE PLACEMENT OF THE HEDGE TO SETTLEMENT AT EACH MONTH END DURING THE QUARTER HAD A DE MINIMIS IMPACT TO THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO TRANSFERS BETWEEN FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT LEVELS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC TOPIC 360,  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  WHEN EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT LONG-LIVED ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED, WE COMPARE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO THE PROJECTION OF FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THESE ASSETS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, WE RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE AGAINST INCOME EQUAL TO THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE ASSETS\u2019 FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET VALUES, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL APPRAISALS, AS APPLICABLE. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING VALUE OR ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE.  WE HAD NO ASSETS HELD FOR SALE ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  WE ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 718.  SHARE-BASED AWARDS GRANTED INCLUDE STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS. WE UTILIZE THE BLACK\u2010SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS, WHICH REQUIRES THE INPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING ESTIMATING STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED TERM. HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK PRICE WAS USED WHILE THE EXPECTED TERM FOR OUR OPTIONS WAS ESTIMATED BASED ON HISTORICAL OPTION EXERCISE BEHAVIOR AND POST-VESTING FORFEITURES OF OPTIONS, AND THE CONTRACTUAL TERM, THE VESTING PERIOD AND THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE OUTSTANDING OPTIONS. FURTHER, WE APPLY AN EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. WE USE HISTORICAL FORFEITURES TO ESTIMATE THE RATE OF FUTURE FORFEITURES. CHANGES IN THESE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS CAN MATERIALLY AFFECT THE MEASURE OF ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR STOCK COMPENSATION. THE COST OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS IS DETERMINED USING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT.  WE RECOGNIZE THE COMPENSATION COSTS NET OF AN ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE OPTIONS AWARD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE VESTING TERM OF FOUR YEARS. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY ONE, THREE OR FOUR YEARS. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECORDED IN COST OF REVENUE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  INCOME TAXES  WE ACCOUNT FOR INCOME TAXES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC TOPIC 740,  INCOME TAXES  (\u201cASC 740\u201d), WHICH REQUIRES THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BE RECOGNIZED USING ENACTED TAX RATES FOR THE EFFECT OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE BOOK AND TAX BASES OF RECORDED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ASC 740 ALSO REQUIRES THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BE REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A PORTION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED. OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO ZERO BY VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  WE PROVIDE FOR INCOME TAXES BASED UPON THE GEOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF WORLDWIDE EARNINGS AND TAX REGULATIONS GOVERNING EACH REGION, PARTICULARLY CHINA. THE CALCULATION OF TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX LAWS, PARTICULARLY IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHINA.  SEE NOTE 14\u2014\u201cINCOME TAXES\u201d IN THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REVENUE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  INCREASE  2019  2018  (DECREASE)% CHANGE  PRODUCT TYPE.

THE SUBSTRATE REVENUE DECREASE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER DEMAND RESULTING FROM A GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOW-DOWN, INCLUDING THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY.

REVENUE FROM CUSTOMERS IN NORTH AMERICA INCREASED BY 48.4% IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INP SHIPMENTS AND THE RELOCATION BY A CUSTOMER IN JAPAN OF ITS MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION FROM JAPAN TO THE UNITED STATES FOR A CERTAIN DIVISION. REVENUE FROM CUSTOMERS IN EUROPE DECREASED BY 31.6% PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN DEMAND OF GAAS WAFER SUBSTRATES USED BY AN  LED CUSTOMER. REVENUE FROM JAPAN, TAIWAN AND THE OTHER ASIAN PACIFIC COUNTRIES, IN AGGREGATE, DECREASED BY $3.0 MILLION IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 DUE TO A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR SEMICONDUCTING GAAS USED IN WIRELESS DEVICE APPLICATION, AND THE RELOCATION BY A CUSTOMER IN JAPAN OF ITS MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION FROM JAPAN TO THE UNITED STATES FOR A CERTAIN DIVISION.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GROSS MARGIN  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  INCREASE  2019  2018  (DECREASE)% CHANGE  ($ IN THOUSANDS)  GROSS PROFIT  $6,695  $9,573  $(2,878)  (30.1)%  GROSS MARGIN %  33.1%  39.2%  GROSS PROFIT DECREASED $2.9 MILLION, OR 30.1%, TO $6.7 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 FROM $9.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE LOWER SALES VOLUME DURING THE PERIOD OF MARCH 31, 2019 WHEN COMPARED TO THE PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND TO HIGHER MANUFACTURING COSTS, PARTICULARLY IN GAAS.

NO INCOME TAXES OR BENEFITS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED FOR OUR U.S. OPERATIONS AS THE INCOME IN THE U.S. HAD BEEN FULLY OFFSET BY UTILIZATION OF FEDERAL AND STATE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS UNCERTAINTY OF GENERATING FUTURE PROFIT IN THE U.S., WHICH HAS RESULTED IN OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BEING FULLY RESERVED. OUR ESTIMATED TAX RATE CAN VARY GREATLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE OR BENEFIT IN THE MIX OF TAXABLE INCOME BETWEEN OUR U.S. AND CHINA-BASED OPERATIONS.  DUE TO OUR UNCERTAINTY REGARDING OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY IN THE U.S., WE RECORDED A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $20 MILLION IN 2018, $22 MILLION IN 2017 AND $68 MILLION IN 2016.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO  MARCH 31,  NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  2019  2018  DECREASE% CHANGE  ($ IN THOUSANDS)  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  $81  $315  $(234)  (74.3)%% OF TOTAL REVENUE  0.4%  1.3%  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS DECREASED $234,000 OR 74.3% TO $81,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 FROM $315,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PROFITABILITY FROM OUR CHINA JOINT VENTURE OPERATIONS AS SALES DECREASED DUE TO A REDUCTION IN RAW MATERIAL SALES.

ON OCTOBER 27, 2014, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM PURSUANT TO WHICH WE MAY REPURCHASE UP TO $5.0 MILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK.  THESE REPURCHASES COULD BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE OPEN MARKET AND COULD BE FUNDED FROM OUR EXISTING CASH BALANCES AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS.  DURING 2015, WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 908,000 SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $2.52 PER SHARE FOR A TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $2.3 MILLION UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  NO SHARES WERE REPURCHASED DURING 2016 UNDER THIS PROGRAM. DURING THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES UNDER THE APPROVED STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, APPROXIMATELY $2.7 MILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE REPURCHASES UNDER THIS PROGRAM. CURRENTLY, WE DO NOT PLAN TO REPURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHARES.  DIVIDENDS ACCRUE ON OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK, AND ARE PAYABLE AS AND WHEN DECLARED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  WE HAVE NEVER DECLARED OR PAID ANY DIVIDENDS ON THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK.

THE BEIJING CITY GOVERNMENT IS MOVING ITS OFFICES INTO THE AREA WHERE OUR ORIGINAL MANUFACTURING FACILITY IS CURRENTLY LOCATED AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING THOUSANDS OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES INTO THIS AREA. TO CREATE ROOM AND UPGRADE THE DISTRICT, THE CITY INSTRUCTED VIRTUALLY ALL EXISTING MANUFACTURING COMPANIES, INCLUDING AXT, TO RELOCATE ALL OR SOME OF THEIR MANUFACTURING LINES. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE RELOCATION OF OUR GALLIUM ARSENIDE AND GERMANIUM PRODUCTION LINES.  ONE NEW SITE, THE CITY OF KAZUO, LOCATED IN THE PROVINCE IN LIAONING NEAR THE INNER MONGOLIA AUTONOMOUS REGION, WILL INITIALLY BE USED FOR POLY SYNTHESIS AND INGOT GROWTH FOR GALLIUM ARSENIDE AND GERMANIUM AS WELL AS POSSIBLE EXPANSION OF INDIUM PHOSPHIDE INGOT GROWTH. A SECOND SITE, THE CITY OF DINGXING, LOCATED IN THE PROVINCE OF HEBEI AND UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE PREFECTURE-LEVEL CITY OF BAODING, WILL BE USED FOR WAFER PROCESSING.  WE EXPECT TO INVEST APPROXIMATELY $21 MILLION RELATED TO THE NEW FACILITIES IN 2019.  WE INTEND TO COMPLETE THE RELOCATION PROCESS FOR GAAS AND GE IN 2019.  ONE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE COMPANIES, JINMEI, IS IN THE PROCESS OF RELOCATING ITS HEADQUARTERS AND MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS TO THE CITY OF KAZUO, NEAR OUR OWN LOCATION. CURRENTLY, JINMEI EXPECTS TO INVEST APPROXIMATELY $2.5 TO $3.5 MILLION RELATED TO THE NEW FACILITIES IN 2019. IN JULY 2017, OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, TONGMEI, PROVIDED AN INTER-COMPANY LOAN TO JINMEI IN THE AMOUNT OF $768,000 IN PREPARATION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THE LAND USE RIGHTS AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW BUILDING. THE INTER-COMPANY LOAN CARRIES AN INTEREST RATE OF 4.9% PER ANNUM AND IS DUE ON JUNE 30, 2023. DURING 2019 AND 2018, JINMEI REPAID TO TONGMEI PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST TOTALING $41,000 AND $453,000, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, THE REMAINING BALANCE OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST TOTALED $299,000.  ON NOVEMBER 6, 2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH ESTABLISHED A $10 MILLION SECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT WITH A $1.0 MILLION LETTER OF CREDIT SUBLIMIT FACILITY. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS COLLATERALIZED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY LOCATED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. THE COMMITMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT EXPIRE ON NOVEMBER 30, 2020 AND ANY LOANS THEREUNDER WILL  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE BASED ON THE DAILY ONE-MONTH LIBOR FOR THE APPLICABLE INTEREST PERIOD PLUS A MARGIN OF 2.00%.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, NO LOANS OR LETTERS OF CREDIT WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE CASH AND INVESTMENTS TO MEET OUR OPERATING NEEDS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. IF OUR SALES DECREASE, HOWEVER, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE LIQUIDITY, REQUIRE US TO USE CASH AT A MORE RAPID RATE THAN EXPECTED, AND REQUIRE US TO SEEK ADDITIONAL CAPITAL.  ON OCTOBER 24, 2016, WE FILED WITH THE SEC A REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE MAY OFFER UP TO $60 MILLION OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK, DEPOSITARY SHARES, WARRANTS, DEBT SECURITIES AND/OR UNITS IN ONE OR MORE OFFERINGS AND IN ANY COMBINATION. ON NOVEMBER 4, 2016, THE SEC DECLARED THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT EFFECTIVE. A PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT, WHICH WE WILL PROVIDE EACH TIME WE OFFER SECURITIES, WILL DESCRIBE THE SPECIFIC AMOUNTS, PRICES AND TERMS OF THE SECURITIES WE DETERMINE TO OFFER.  ON MARCH 2, 2017, WE FILED WITH THE SEC A FINAL PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE OFFERED AND SOLD 5,307,692 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  THE NET PROCEEDS ARE BEING USED FOR THE RELOCATION OF OUR GALLIUM ARSENIDE PRODUCTION LINE, FOR EQUIPMENT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL FOR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY, POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS OF COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES OR BUSINESSES AND OTHER GENERAL PURPOSES.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  PURCHASE ORDERS OR CONTRACTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF CERTAIN GOODS AND SERVICES ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE PART OF OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. WE CANNOT DETERMINE THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SUCH PURCHASE ORDERS THAT REPRESENT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS BECAUSE PURCHASE ORDERS MAY REPRESENT AUTHORIZATIONS TO PURCHASE RATHER THAN BINDING AGREEMENTS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS DISCLOSURE, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR PURCHASE OF GOODS OR SERVICES ARE DEFINED AS AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING AND THAT SPECIFY ALL SIGNIFICANT TERMS, INCLUDING FIXED OR MINIMUM QUANTITIES TO BE PURCHASED; FIXED, MINIMUM, OR VARIABLE PRICE PROVISIONS; AND THE APPROXIMATE TIMING OF THE TRANSACTION. OUR PURCHASE ORDERS ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT NEEDS AND ARE FULFILLED BY OUR VENDORS WITHIN SHORT TIME HORIZONS. WE ALSO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS FOR OUTSOURCED SERVICES; HOWEVER, THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE CONTRACTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT AND THE CONTRACTS GENERALLY CONTAIN CLAUSES ALLOWING FOR CANCELLATION WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT PENALTY. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE CONTINGENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES WOULD ALSO NOT BE INCLUDED.  LAND PURCHASE AND INVESTMENT AGREEMENT  WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF RELOCATING OUR GALLIUM ARSENIDE PRODUCTION LINE TO DINGXING, CHINA.  IN ADDITION TO A LAND RIGHTS AND BUILDING PURCHASE AGREEMENT THAT WE ENTERED INTO WITH A PRIVATE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT COMPANY TO ACQUIRE OUR NEW MANUFACTURING FACILITY, WE ALSO ENTERED INTO A COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH THE DINGXING LOCAL GOVERNMENT.  IN ADDITION TO PLEDGING ITS FULL SUPPORT AND COOPERATION, THE DINGXING LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL ISSUE CERTAIN CREDITS OR REBATES TO US AS WE ACHIEVE CERTAIN MILESTONES.  WE, IN TURN, AGREED TO HIRE LOCAL WORKERS OVER TIME, PAY TAXES WHEN DUE AND EVENTUALLY DEMONSTRATE A TOTAL INVESTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION IN VALUE, ASSETS AND CAPITAL.  THE INVESTMENT WILL INCLUDE CASH PAID FOR THE LAND AND BUILDINGS, CASH ON DEPOSIT IN OUR NAME AT LOCAL BANKS, THE GROSS VALUE OF NEW AND USED EQUIPMENT (INCLUDING FUTURE EQUIPMENT THAT MIGHT BE USED FOR INDIUM PHOSPHIDE AND GERMANIUM SUBSTRATES PRODUCTION), THE DEEMED VALUE FOR OUR CUSTOMER LIST OR THE END USER OF OUR SUBSTRATES (FOR EXAMPLE, THE END USERS OF 3-D SENSING VCSELS), A DEEMED VALUE FOR EMPLOYMENT OF LOCAL CITIZENS, A DEEMED VALUE FOR OUR PROPRIETARY PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OTHER INTANGIBLES AND ADDITIONAL ITEMS OF VALUE.  THERE IS NO TIMELINE OR DEADLINE BY WHICH THIS MUST BE ACCOMPLISHED, RATHER IT IS A GOOD FAITH COVENANT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN AXT AND THE DINGXING LOCAL GOVERNMENT.  FURTHER, THERE IS NO SPECIFIC PENALTY CONTEMPLATED IF EITHER PARTY BREACHES THE AGREEMENT. HOWEVER THE AGREEMENT DOES STATE THAT EACH PARTY HAS A RIGHT TO SEEK FROM THE OTHER PARTY COMPENSATION FOR LOSSES.  UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, THE DINGXING LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAY PURCHASE THE LAND AND BUILDING AT THE APPRAISED VALUE. WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH COOPERATION AGREEMENTS ARE NORMAL, CUSTOMARY AND USUAL IN CHINA AND THAT THE FUTURE VALUATION IS FLEXIBLE. WE HAVE A SIMILAR AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF KAZUO, CHINA, ALTHOUGH ON A SMALLER SCALE. THE TOTAL  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVESTMENT TARGETED BY AXT IN KAZUO IS APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION IN VALUE, ASSETS AND CAPITAL. IN ADDITION, BOYU HAS A SIMILAR AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF KAZUO.

SEE \"  NOTE 8  - REGULATORY CAPITAL\" TO CUSTOMERS' UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION REGARDING REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  CUSTOMERS IS INVOLVED WITH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISKS.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISKS ARE INCURRED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF THE BANK'S CUSTOMERS.  THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT, INCLUDING UNUSED PORTIONS OF LINES OF CREDIT, AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT.  THOSE INSTRUMENTS INVOLVE, TO VARYING DEGREES, ELEMENTS OF CREDIT RISK IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEETS.  WITH COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT, EXPOSURES TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF NON-PERFORMANCE BY THE OTHER PARTY TO THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS REPRESENTED BY THE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT OF THOSE INSTRUMENTS.  THE SAME CREDIT POLICIES ARE USED IN MAKING COMMITMENTS AND  61  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONDITIONAL OBLIGATIONS AS FOR ON-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS.  BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE CREDIT RISK SIMILAR TO EXTENDING A LOAN OR LEASE, COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT ARE SUBJECT TO THE BANK\u2019S CREDIT POLICY AND OTHER UNDERWRITING STANDARDS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE FOLLOWING OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS WERE OUTSTANDING.

COMMITMENTS TO FUND LOANS AND LEASES AND UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS UNDER LINES OF CREDIT MAY BE OBLIGATIONS OF THE BANK AS LONG AS THERE IS NO VIOLATION OF ANY CONDITION ESTABLISHED IN THE CONTRACT.  BECAUSE MANY OF THE COMMITMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING DRAWN UPON, THE TOTAL COMMITMENT AMOUNTS DO NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS.  COMMITMENTS GENERALLY HAVE FIXED EXPIRATION DATES OR OTHER TERMINATION CLAUSES AND MAY REQUIRE PAYMENT OF A FEE.  THE BANK EVALUATES EACH CUSTOMER\u2019S CREDITWORTHINESS ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.  THE AMOUNT OF COLLATERAL OBTAINED, IF THE BANK DEEMS IT NECESSARY UPON EXTENSION OF CREDIT, IS BASED UPON MANAGEMENT\u2019S CREDIT EVALUATION.  COLLATERAL HELD VARIES BUT MAY INCLUDE PERSONAL OR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY AND EQUIPMENT.  MORTGAGE WAREHOUSE LOAN COMMITMENTS ARE AGREEMENTS TO FUND THE PIPELINES OF MORTGAGE BANKING BUSINESSES FROM CLOSING OF INDIVIDUAL MORTGAGE LOANS UNTIL THEIR SALE INTO THE SECONDARY MARKET. MOST OF THE INDIVIDUAL MORTGAGE LOANS ARE INSURED OR GUARANTEED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT THROUGH ONE OF ITS PROGRAMS SUCH AS FHA, VA, OR ARE CONVENTIONAL LOANS ELIGIBLE FOR SALE TO FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC. THESE COMMITMENTS GENERALLY FLUCTUATE MONTHLY BASED ON CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, REFINANCE ACTIVITY, NEW HOME SALES AND LAWS AND REGULATION.  OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT WRITTEN ARE CONDITIONAL COMMITMENTS ISSUED BY THE BANK TO GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF A CUSTOMER TO A THIRD PARTY. LETTERS OF CREDIT MAY OBLIGATE THE BANK TO FUND DRAWS UNDER THOSE LETTERS OF CREDIT WHETHER OR NOT A CUSTOMER CONTINUES TO MEET THE CONDITIONS OF THE EXTENSION OF CREDIT. THE CREDIT RISK INVOLVED IN ISSUING LETTERS OF CREDIT IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT INVOLVED IN EXTENDING LOAN AND LEASE FACILITIES TO CUSTOMERS.  EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT MONETARY POLICIES  OUR EARNINGS ARE AND WILL BE AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND ITS AGENCIES. AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD IS TO REGULATE THE MONEY SUPPLY AND INTEREST RATES. AMONG THE INSTRUMENTS USED TO IMPLEMENT THOSE OBJECTIVES ARE OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS IN UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SECURITIES AND CHANGES IN RESERVE REQUIREMENTS AGAINST MEMBER BANK DEPOSITS. THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE USED IN VARYING COMBINATIONS TO INFLUENCE OVERALL GROWTH AND DISTRIBUTION OF BANK LOANS AND LEASES, INVESTMENTS, AND DEPOSITS, AND THEIR USE MAY ALSO AFFECT RATES CHARGED ON LOANS AND LEASES OR PAID FOR DEPOSITS.", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Customers Bancorp, Inc.", "CIK": 1488813, "Date": "2019-05-09T00:00:00", "Ticker": "CUBI-PD", "Name": "Customers Bancorp Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 6022.0, "Business": "PA", "Incorporated": "PA", "IRS": 272290659.0, "key": "20190509CUBI-PD", "labelr1": 0.07707129094412167, "labelr2": -0.3465537158259525, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.24460478, "prof1": 0.75539523, "return1&2": 0.9973025048169556, "return1&2&3": 0.9973025048169556, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9973025048169556, "return2": 0.9965344628417404, "return1": 1.0007707129094412, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 0.07707129094411957, "cumulative_return1": 0.9624659617509276, "cumulative_return1&2": 1.1589528705967005, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.1705825791023498, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.07787406448434409, "indexx": 933, "cumreturn1b": 1.421319498652244, "cumreturndow": 0.9855218921413533, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9815448774593873}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1068, "level_0": 1969, "index": 87129, "text": "ITEM 2.

MOST OF OUR DATA CENTER PROPERTIES CONTAIN FULLY REDUNDANT ELECTRICAL SUPPLY SYSTEMS, MULTIPLE POWER FEEDS, ABOVE-STANDARD COOLING SYSTEMS, RAISED FLOOR AREAS, EXTENSIVE IN-BUILDING COMMUNICATIONS CABLING AND HIGH-LEVEL SECURITY SYSTEMS. WE FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON OWNING, ACQUIRING, DEVELOPING AND OPERATING DATA CENTERS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THE GROWTH IN DATA CENTER DEMAND AND THE TECHNOLOGY-RELATED REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY GENERALLY WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE THE OVERALL ECONOMY.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR PORTFOLIO INCLUDED  215  DATA CENTERS, INCLUDING  35  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES, WITH APPROXIMATELY  34.9 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY  3.2 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROXIMATELY  2.1 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT. THE  35  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES HAVE AN AGGREGATE OF APPROXIMATELY  3.7 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET. THE  27  PARCELS OF DEVELOPABLE LAND WE OWN AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY  964  ACRES. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY  2.7 MILLION  SQUARE FEET WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION FOR TURN-KEY FLEX  \u00ae  AND POWERED BASE BUILDING  \u00ae  PRODUCTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE INCOME PRODUCING ON OR AFTER COMPLETION, IN  FOUR  U.S. METROPOLITAN AREAS,  FOUR  EUROPEAN METROPOLITAN AREAS,  TWO  ASIAN METROPOLITAN AREAS,  ONE  AUSTRALIAN METROPOLITAN AREAS AND  ONE  CANADIAN METROPOLITAN AREA, CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY  1.8 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF BASE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND  0.9 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF DATA CENTER CONSTRUCTION.  WE HAVE DEVELOPED DETAILED, STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATING NEW REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY MEET OUR FINANCIAL, TECHNICAL AND OTHER CRITERIA. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL ASSETS AS PART OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY. WE INTEND TO AGGRESSIVELY MANAGE AND LEASE OUR ASSETS TO INCREASE THEIR CASH FLOW. WE MAY CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT OUR DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO WHEN JUSTIFIED BY ANTICIPATED DEMAND AND RETURNS.  WE MAY ACQUIRE PROPERTIES SUBJECT TO EXISTING MORTGAGE FINANCING AND OTHER INDEBTEDNESS OR WE MAY INCUR NEW INDEBTEDNESS IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUIRING OR REFINANCING THESE PROPERTIES. DEBT SERVICE ON SUCH INDEBTEDNESS WILL HAVE A PRIORITY OVER ANY CASH DIVIDENDS WITH RESPECT TO DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.\u2019S COMMON STOCK AND PREFERRED STOCK. WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A CONSERVATIVE CAPITAL STRUCTURE. WE TARGET A DEBT-TO-ADJUSTED EBITDA RATIO AT OR LESS THAN 5.5X, FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE OF GREATER THAN THREE TIMES, AND FLOATING RATE DEBT AT LESS THAN 20% OF TOTAL OUTSTANDING DEBT. IN ADDITION, WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A WELL-LADDERED DEBT MATURITY SCHEDULE, AND WE SEEK TO MAXIMIZE THE MENU OF OUR AVAILABLE SOURCES OF CAPITAL, WHILE MINIMIZING THE COST.  REVENUE BASE  . AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE OPERATED  215  DATA CENTERS THROUGH OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, INCLUDING  35  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES.

AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THE  35  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES, WERE APPROXIMATELY  88.6%  LEASED EXCLUDING APPROXIMATELY  3.2 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROXIMATELY  2.1 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT. DUE TO THE CAPITAL-INTENSIVE AND LONG-TERM NATURE OF THE OPERATIONS BEING SUPPORTED, OUR LEASE TERMS ARE GENERALLY LONGER THAN STANDARD COMMERCIAL LEASES. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR AVERAGE REMAINING LEASE TERM IS APPROXIMATELY  FIVE  YEARS. OUR SCHEDULED LEASE EXPIRATIONS THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2020 ARE  18.1%  OF RENTABLE SQUARE FEET EXCLUDING MONTH-TO-MONTH LEASES, SPACE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND SPACE HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019.  FACTORS WHICH MAY INFLUENCE FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GLOBAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN SOME OR ALL OF THE METROPOLITAN AREAS IN WHICH WE OWN PROPERTIES AND CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS. IN JUNE 2016, A MAJORITY OF VOTERS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ELECTED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION IN A NATIONAL REFERENDUM. THE TERMS OF ANY WITHDRAWAL ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS. NEVERTHELESS, THE REFERENDUM HAS CREATED SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE FUTURE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND HAS GIVEN RISE TO CALLS FOR THE GOVERNMENTS OF OTHER EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES TO CONSIDER WITHDRAWAL. INSTABILITY IN THE U.S., EUROPEAN, ASIA PACIFIC AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND ECONOMIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY, AND THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, TO REPLACE OR RENEW MATURING LIABILITIES ON A TIMELY BASIS, ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS TO MEET LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS AND MAY RESULT IN ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR, AND OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN ADDITION, OUR ACCESS TO FUNDS UNDER OUR GLOBAL REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DEPENDS ON THE ABILITY OF THE LENDERS THAT ARE PARTIES TO SUCH FACILITIES TO MEET THEIR FUNDING COMMITMENTS TO US. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT LONG-TERM DISRUPTIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND THE RETURN OF TIGHTER CREDIT CONDITIONS AMONG, AND POTENTIAL FAILURES OR NATIONALIZATIONS OF, THIRD PARTY FINANCIAL  65  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INSTITUTIONS AS A RESULT OF SUCH DISRUPTIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LENDERS. IF OUR LENDERS ARE NOT ABLE TO MEET THEIR FUNDING COMMITMENTS TO US, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  IF WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW TO CONTINUE OPERATING OUR BUSINESS AND ARE UNABLE TO BORROW ADDITIONAL FUNDS, ACCESS OUR EXISTING LINES OF CREDIT OR RAISE EQUITY OR DEBT CAPITAL, WE MAY NEED TO SOURCE ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO INCREASE OUR LIQUIDITY. SUCH ALTERNATIVES MAY INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CURTAILING DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY, DISPOSING OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR PROPERTIES POSSIBLY ON DISADVANTAGEOUS TERMS OR ENTERING INTO OR RENEWING LEASES ON LESS FAVORABLE TERMS THAN WE OTHERWISE WOULD.  FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK.  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND 2018, WE HAD FOREIGN OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, IRELAND, FRANCE, THE NETHERLANDS, GERMANY, SWITZERLAND, CANADA, SINGAPORE, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN AND HONG KONG AS WELL AS BRAZIL FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , AND, AS SUCH, ARE SUBJECT TO RISK FROM THE EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH MAY AFFECT FUTURE COSTS AND CASH FLOWS. OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED IN THE BRITISH POUND STERLING, EURO, CANADIAN DOLLAR, SINGAPORE DOLLAR, AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR, BRAZILIAN REAL, JAPANESE YEN AND THE HONG KONG DOLLAR. AS A RESULT OF THE ASCENTY JOINT VENTURE AND DECONSOLIDATION OF ASCENTY, OUR EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK RELATED TO THE BRAZILIAN REAL IS LIMITED TO THE IMPACT THAT CURRENCY HAS ON OUR SHARE OF THE ASCENTY JOINT VENTURE'S OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. OUR PRIMARY CURRENCY EXPOSURES ARE TO THE BRITISH POUND STERLING, THE EURO AND THE SINGAPORE DOLLAR. THE POSSIBLE EXIT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM (OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY) FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, OR PROLONGED PERIODS OF UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO ANY OF THESE POSSIBILITIES, COULD RESULT IN INCREASED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE VOLATILITY. WE ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE A PORTION OF THE RISK OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATION BY FINANCING OUR INVESTMENTS IN THE LOCAL CURRENCY DENOMINATIONS, ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL BE EFFECTIVE. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN THE RELATION OF ANY SUCH FOREIGN CURRENCY TO U.S. DOLLARS MAY AFFECT OUR REVENUES, OPERATING MARGINS AND DISTRIBUTIONS AND MAY ALSO AFFECT THE BOOK VALUE OF OUR ASSETS, THE BOOK VALUE OF OUR DEBT AND THE AMOUNT OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY.  RENTAL INCOME  . THE AMOUNT OF RENTAL INCOME GENERATED BY THE DATA CENTERS IN OUR PORTFOLIO DEPENDS ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR IMPROVE THE OCCUPANCY RATES OF CURRENTLY LEASED SPACE AND TO LEASE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE SPACE AND SPACE AVAILABLE FROM LEASE TERMINATIONS. EXCLUDING APPROXIMATELY  3.2 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROXIMATELY  2.1 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE OCCUPANCY RATE OF OUR PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THE  35  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES, WAS APPROXIMATELY  88.6%  OF OUR NET RENTABLE SQUARE FEET.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD MORE THAN  2,000  CUSTOMERS IN OUR DATA CENTER PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THE  13  DATA CENTERS HELD IN OUR MANAGED PORTFOLIO OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY  91%  OF OUR LEASES (ON A RENTABLE SQUARE FOOTAGE BASIS) CONTAINED BASE RENT ESCALATIONS THAT WERE EITHER FIXED (GENERALLY RANGING FROM  2%  TO  4%  ) OR INDEXED BASED ON A CONSUMER PRICE INDEX OR OTHER SIMILAR INFLATION-RELATED INDEX. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THESE ESCALATIONS WILL COVER ANY INCREASES IN OUR COSTS OR WILL OTHERWISE KEEP RENTAL RATES AT OR ABOVE MARKET RATES.  THE AMOUNT OF RENTAL INCOME GENERATED BY US ALSO DEPENDS ON MAINTAINING OR INCREASING RENTAL RATES AT OUR PROPERTIES, WHICH IN TURN DEPENDS ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND MARKET RATES FOR DATA CENTER SPACE. INCLUDED IN OUR APPROXIMATELY  26.6 MILLION  NET RENTABLE SQUARE FEET, EXCLUDING SPACE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND SPACE HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT AND  35  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES, AT  MARCH 31, 2019  IS APPROXIMATELY  0.9 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF DATA CENTER SPACE WITH EXTENSIVE INSTALLED TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AVAILABLE FOR LEASE. OUR TURN-KEY FLEX  \u00ae  PRODUCT IS AN EFFECTIVE SOLUTION FOR CUSTOMERS WHO PREFER TO UTILIZE A PARTNER WITH THE EXPERTISE OR CAPITAL BUDGET TO PROVIDE EXTENSIVE DATA CENTER INFRASTRUCTURE AND SECURITY. OUR EXPERTISE IN DATA CENTER CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATIONS ENABLES US TO LEASE SPACE TO THESE CUSTOMERS AT A PREMIUM OVER OTHER USES. IN ADDITION, AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  3.2 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROXIMATELY  2.1 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT, OR APPROXIMATELY  15%  OF THE TOTAL RENTABLE SPACE IN OUR PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THE  35  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES. OUR ABILITY TO GROW EARNINGS DEPENDS IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP SPACE AND LEASE DEVELOPMENT SPACE AT FAVORABLE RATES, WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN. DEVELOPMENT SPACE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN ORDER TO DEVELOP DATA CENTER FACILITIES THAT ARE READY FOR USE AND, IN ADDITION, WE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL TIME OR ENCOUNTER DELAYS IN SECURING TENANTS FOR DEVELOPMENT SPACE. WE MAY PURCHASE ADDITIONAL VACANT PROPERTIES AND PROPERTIES WITH VACANT DEVELOPMENT SPACE IN THE FUTURE. WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO FINANCE OUR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE OR MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER \u201cGLOBAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.\u201d  IN ADDITION, THE TIMING BETWEEN WHEN WE SIGN A NEW LEASE WITH A CUSTOMER AND WHEN THAT LEASE COMMENCES AND WE BEGIN TO GENERATE RENTAL INCOME MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND MAY NOT BE EASILY PREDICTABLE. CERTAIN LEASES MAY PROVIDE FOR STAGGERED COMMENCEMENT DATES FOR ADDITIONAL SPACE, THE TIMING OF WHICH MAY BE DELAYED SIGNIFICANTLY.  66  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER \u201cGLOBAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,\u201d OR REGIONAL DOWNTURNS AFFECTING OUR METROPOLITAN AREAS OR DOWNTURNS IN THE DATA CENTER INDUSTRY THAT IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO LEASE OR RENEW OR RE-LEASE SPACE, OR OTHERWISE REDUCE RETURNS ON OUR INVESTMENTS OR THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO FULFILL THEIR LEASE COMMITMENTS, AS IN THE CASE OF TENANT BANKRUPTCIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE RENTAL RATES AT OUR PROPERTIES.  SCHEDULED LEASE EXPIRATIONS.  OUR ABILITY TO RE-LEASE EXPIRING SPACE AT RENTAL RATES EQUAL TO OR IN EXCESS OF CURRENT RENTAL RATES WILL IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO APPROXIMATELY  3.2 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF AVAILABLE SPACE IN OUR PORTFOLIO, WHICH EXCLUDES APPROXIMATELY  3.2 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROXIMATELY  2.1 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND THE  SEVENTEEN  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN OUR NON-MANAGED UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES, LEASES REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY  8.9%  AND  9.2%  OF THE NET RENTABLE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF OUR PORTFOLIO ARE SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2020, RESPECTIVELY.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE SIGNED RENEWAL LEASES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  2.0 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE AND NEW LEASES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  0.3 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE.

(5)  INCLUDES LEASES SIGNED FOR NEW AND RE-LEASED SPACE.  OUR ABILITY TO RE-LEASE OR RENEW EXPIRING SPACE AT RENTAL RATES EQUAL TO OR IN EXCESS OF CURRENT RENTAL RATES WILL IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE CONTINUE TO SEE STRONG DEMAND IN MOST OF OUR KEY METROPOLITAN AREAS FOR DATA CENTER SPACE AND, SUBJECT TO THE SUPPLY OF AVAILABLE DATA CENTER SPACE IN THESE METROPOLITAN AREAS, EXPECT THE RENTAL RATES WE ARE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE ON RE-LEASED OR RENEWED DATA CENTER SPACE LEASES FOR 2018 EXPIRATIONS ON AN AVERAGE AGGREGATE BASIS WILL GENERALLY BE HIGHER THAN THE RATES CURRENTLY BEING PAID FOR THE SAME SPACE ON A GAAP BASIS AND SLIGHTLY DOWN ON A CASH BASIS. FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , RENTS ON RENEWED SPACE INCREASED BY AN AVERAGE OF  4.3%  ON A GAAP BASIS ON OUR TURN-KEY FLEX  \u00ae  SPACE COMPARED TO THE EXPIRING RENTS AND INCREASED BY AN AVERAGE OF  11.1%  ON A GAAP BASIS ON OUR POWERED BASE BUILDING  \u00ae  SPACE COMPARED TO THE EXPIRING RENTS. OUR PAST PERFORMANCE MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS, AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT LEASES WILL BE RENEWED OR THAT OUR DATA CENTERS WILL BE RE-LEASED AT ALL OR AT RENTAL RATES EQUAL TO OR ABOVE THE CURRENT AVERAGE  67  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RENTAL RATES. FURTHER, RE-LEASED/RENEWED RENTAL RATES IN A PARTICULAR METROPOLITAN AREA MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH RENTAL RATES ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO AS A WHOLE AND MAY FLUCTUATE FROM ONE PERIOD TO ANOTHER DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING LOCAL REAL ESTATE CONDITIONS, LOCAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR DATA CENTER SPACE, COMPETITION FROM OTHER DATA CENTER DEVELOPERS OR OPERATORS, THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY AND WHETHER THE PROPERTY, OR SPACE WITHIN THE PROPERTY, HAS BEEN DEVELOPED.  GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION.  WE DEPEND ON THE MARKET FOR DATA CENTERS IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THESE REGIONAL METROPOLITAN AREAS CAN IMPACT OUR FUTURE RESULTS. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THE  35  DATA CENTERS HELD AS INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES, WAS GEOGRAPHICALLY CONCENTRATED IN THE FOLLOWING METROPOLITAN AREAS.

THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ABATEMENTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS APPROXIMATELY  $17.9 MILLION.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  OUR OPERATING EXPENSES GENERALLY CONSIST OF UTILITIES, PROPERTY AND AD VALOREM TAXES, PROPERTY MANAGEMENT FEES, INSURANCE AND SITE MAINTENANCE COSTS, AS WELL AS RENTAL EXPENSES ON OUR GROUND AND BUILDING LEASES. IN PARTICULAR, OUR BUILDINGS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT POWER TO SUPPORT THE DATA CENTER OPERATIONS CONTAINED IN THEM. MANY OF OUR LEASES CONTAIN PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE TENANTS REIMBURSE US FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES AND REAL ESTATE TAXES INCURRED BY US. HOWEVER, IN SOME CASES WE ARE NOT ENTITLED TO REIMBURSEMENT OF PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, OTHER THAN UTILITY EXPENSE, AND REAL ESTATE TAXES UNDER OUR LEASES FOR TURN-KEY FLEX\u00ae FACILITIES. WE ALSO INCUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING EXPENSES RELATING TO OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION, OR THE SEC, REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN SUCH OPERATING EXPENSES WILL IMPACT OUR OVERALL PERFORMANCE. WE EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL OPERATING EXPENSES AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND.  CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION.  IN JUNE 2009, THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES APPROVED COMPREHENSIVE CLEAN ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION INTENDED TO CUT GREENHOUSE GAS, OR GHG, EMISSIONS, VIA A CAP-AND-TRADE PROGRAM. THE U.S. SENATE DID NOT SUBSEQUENTLY PASS SIMILAR LEGISLATION. SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION TO FEDERAL CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION EXISTS.  IN THE ABSENCE OF COMPREHENSIVE FEDERAL CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION, OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, REGULATORY AGENCIES, PRIMARILY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, OR EPA, AND STATES TOOK THE LEAD IN REGULATING GHG EMISSIONS IN THE U.S. UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, THE EPA MOVED AGGRESSIVELY TO REGULATE GHG EMISSIONS FROM AUTOMOBILES AND LARGE STATIONARY SOURCES, INCLUDING ELECTRICITY PRODUCERS, USING ITS OWN AUTHORITY UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS MOVED TO ELIMINATE OR MODIFY CERTAIN OF THE EPA\u2019S GHG EMISSIONS REGULATIONS AND REFOCUS THE EPA\u2019S MISSION AWAY FROM SUCH REGULATION.  68  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE EPA MADE AN ENDANGERMENT FINDING IN 2009 THAT ALLOWS IT TO CREATE REGULATIONS IMPOSING EMISSIONS REPORTING, PERMITTING, CONTROL TECHNOLOGY INSTALLATION, AND MONITORING REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN EMITTERS OF GHGS, INCLUDING FACILITIES THAT PROVIDE ELECTRICITY TO OUR DATA CENTERS, ALTHOUGH THE MATERIALITY OF THE IMPACTS WILL NOT BE FULLY KNOWN UNTIL ALL REGULATIONS ARE FINALIZED AND LEGAL CHALLENGES ARE RESOLVED. UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, THE EPA FINALIZED RULES IMPOSING  PERMITTING AND CONTROL TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS UPON CERTAIN NEWLY-CONSTRUCTED OR MODIFIED FACILITIES WHICH EMIT GHGS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT NEW SOURCE REVIEW PREVENTION OF SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION, OR NSR PSD, AND TITLE V PERMITTING PROGRAMS. AS A RESULT, NEWLY-ISSUED NSR PSD AND TITLE V PERMITS FOR NEW OR MODIFIED ELECTRICITY GENERATING UNITS (EGUS) AND OTHER FACILITIES MAY NEED TO ADDRESS GHG EMISSIONS, INCLUDING BY REQUIRING THE INSTALLATION OF \u201cBEST AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGY.\u201d THE EPA IMPLEMENTED IN DECEMBER 2015 THE \u201cCLEAN POWER PLAN\u201d REGULATING CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) EMISSIONS FROM NEW AND EXISTING COAL-FIRED AND NATURAL GAS EGUS. EXISTING EGUS ARE SUBJECT TO STATEWIDE CO2 EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGETS, AN EFFORT DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE A THIRTY-TWO PERCENT REDUCTION IN NATIONWIDE EXISTING EGU CO2 EMISSIONS BY 2030 (IN COMPARISON TO 2005 LEVELS). THE CLEAN POWER PLAN WOULD SUBJECT NEW, MODIFIED, AND RECONSTRUCTED EGUS TO \u201cNEW SOURCE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS\u201d THAT INCLUDE BOTH TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS AND NUMERIC EMISSION LIMITS. HOWEVER, TWENTY-FOUR STATES AND A NUMBER OF INDUSTRY GROUPS CHALLENGED THE CLEAN POWER PLAN IN FEDERAL COURT, AND IN FEBRUARY 2016 THE U.S. SUPREME COURT ISSUED A STAY OF THE CLEAN POWER PLAN UNTIL THE LEGAL CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN DECIDED. IN MARCH 2017, PRESIDENT TRUMP ORDERED THE EPA TO REVIEW AND IF APPROPRIATE REVISE OR RESCIND THE CLEAN POWER PLAN, AND THE EPA PROPOSED TO REPEAL THE CLEAN POWER PLAN IN OCTOBER 2017. IN AUGUST 2018, THE EPA PROPOSED THE \u201cAFFORDABLE CLEAN ENERGY RULE\u201d TO REPLACE THE CLEAN POWER PLAN. SEPARATELY, THE EPA\u2019S GHG \u201cREPORTING RULE\u201d REQUIRES THAT CERTAIN EMITTERS, INCLUDING ELECTRICITY GENERATORS, MONITOR AND REPORT GHG EMISSIONS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MAY SEEK TO REVISE OR REVERSE THESE REGULATIONS.  AS A RESULT, STATES MAY DRIVE NEAR-TERM REGULATION TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. AT THE STATE LEVEL, CALIFORNIA IMPLEMENTED A GHG CAP-AND-TRADE PROGRAM THAT BEGAN IMPOSING COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS ON INDUSTRIAL SECTORS, INCLUDING ELECTRICITY GENERATORS AND IMPORTERS, IN JANUARY 2013. IN SEPTEMBER 2016, CALIFORNIA ADOPTED LEGISLATION CALLING FOR A FURTHER REDUCTION IN GHG EMISSIONS TO 40% BELOW 1990 LEVELS BY 2030, AND IN JULY 2017, CALIFORNIA EXTENDED ITS CAP-AND-TRADE PROGRAM THROUGH 2030. IN SEPTEMBER 2018, CALIFORNIA ADOPTED LEGISLATION THAT WILL REQUIRE ALL OF THE STATE\u2019S ELECTRICITY TO COME FROM CARBON-FREE SOURCES BY 2045. AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF STATE ACTION, IN JANUARY 2018, NEW JERSEY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD RE-JOIN NINE OTHER EASTERN STATES IN THE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE (RGGI), A MARKET-BASED PROGRAM AIMED AT REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS. SEVERAL OTHER STATES HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT THEY ARE ACTIVELY PURSUING NEW GHG REDUCTION PROGRAMS.  OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION, OR EU (INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM), HAS BEEN OPERATING SINCE 2005 UNDER A CAP-AND-TRADE PROGRAM, WHICH DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE LARGEST EMITTERS OF GHGS, INCLUDING ELECTRICITY PRODUCERS FROM WHOM WE PURCHASE POWER, AND THE EU HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF OTHER CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED INITIATIVES, INCLUDING A DIRECTIVE TARGETED AT IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY (WHICH INTRODUCES ENERGY EFFICIENCY AUDITING REQUIREMENTS).  THE PARIS AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE UNITED STATES AND 194 OTHER COUNTRIES AND LOOKS TO PREVENT GLOBAL AVERAGE TEMPERATURES FROM INCREASING BY MORE THAN 2 DEGREES CELSIUS ABOVE PREINDUSTRIAL LEVELS OFFICIALLY WENT INTO FORCE ON NOVEMBER 4, 2016. PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED IN JUNE 2017 THAT HE WILL INITIATE THE PROCESS TO WITHDRAW THE UNITED STATES FROM THE PARIS AGREEMENT; HOWEVER, A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE FORMED GROUPS SUPPORTING THE PARIS AGREEMENT AND PLEDGING TO FULFILL ITS GOALS AT THE STATE LEVEL. NATIONAL LEGISLATION MAY ALSO BE IMPLEMENTED INDEPENDENTLY BY MEMBERS OF THE EU.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CRC ENERGY EFFICIENCY SCHEME INTRODUCED A MANDATORY REPORTING AND PRICING SCHEME THAT IS DESIGNED TO INCENTIVIZE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CUT EMISSIONS BY LARGE ENERGY USERS. IT IS NOT YET CLEAR HOW BREXIT, IF EFFECTUATED, WILL IMPACT THE UNITED KINGDOM\u2019S (OR THE EU\u2019S) APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION. THE CANADIAN GREENHOUSE GAS POLLUTION PRICING ACT ESTABLISHED A CARBON-PRICING REGIME THAT WENT INTO EFFECT JANUARY 1, 2019 FOR PROVINCES AND TERRITORIES IN CANADA WHERE THERE IS NO PROVINCIAL SYSTEM IN PLACE ALREADY, SUCH AS ONTARIO, OR WHERE THE PROVINCIAL SYSTEM DOES NOT MEET THE FEDERAL BENCHMARK. CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATIONS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF IMPLEMENTATION IN OTHER NATIONS AS WELL, INCLUDING NATIONS WHERE WE OPERATE, SUCH AS JAPAN, SINGAPORE, AND AUSTRALIA.  THE COST OF ELECTRIC POWER COMPRISES A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES. ANY ADDITIONAL TAXATION OR REGULATION OF ENERGY USE, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF (I) NEW LEGISLATION THAT CONGRESS MAY PASS, (II) THE REGULATIONS THAT THE EPA HAS PROPOSED OR FINALIZED, (III) REGULATIONS UNDER LEGISLATION THAT STATES HAVE PASSED OR MAY PASS, OR (IV) ANY FURTHER LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS IN THE EU OR OTHER REGIONS WHERE WE OPERATE COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR COSTS, AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY PASS ALL OF THESE COSTS ON TO OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE MATTERS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  INTEREST RATES  . AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  $0.8 BILLION  OF VARIABLE RATE DEBT SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS, ALONG WITH  $857.2 MILLION  ,  $437.9 MILLION  AND  $140.2 MILLION  OF VARIABLE RATE DEBT THAT WAS OUTSTANDING ON THE GLOBAL REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE UNSWAPPED PORTION OF THE UNSECURED TERM LOANS AND THE FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE 2019, OR THE 2019 NOTES, RESPECTIVELY. THE AVAILABILITY OF DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MAY DECREASE OR BE ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS AS A RESULT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER \u201cGLOBAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS\u201d OR OTHER FACTORS. THE EFFECTS ON COMMERCIAL  69  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REAL ESTATE MORTGAGES, IF AVAILABLE, INCLUDE, BUT MAY NOT BE LIMITED TO: HIGHER LOAN SPREADS, TIGHTENED LOAN COVENANTS, REDUCED LOAN-TO-VALUE RATIOS RESULTING IN LOWER BORROWER PROCEEDS AND HIGHER PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS. POTENTIAL FUTURE INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES AND CREDIT SPREADS MAY INCREASE OUR INTEREST EXPENSE AND FIXED CHARGES AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, POTENTIALLY IMPACTING OUR FUTURE ACCESS TO THE DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS. INCREASED INTEREST RATES MAY ALSO INCREASE THE RISK THAT THE COUNTERPARTIES TO OUR SWAP AGREEMENTS WILL DEFAULT ON THEIR OBLIGATIONS, WHICH COULD FURTHER INCREASE OUR INTEREST EXPENSE. IF WE CANNOT OBTAIN CAPITAL FROM THIRD PARTY SOURCES, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP PROPERTIES WHEN STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES EXIST, SATISFY OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS OR PAY THE CASH DIVIDENDS TO DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC.\u2019S STOCKHOLDERS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN ITS QUALIFICATION AS A REIT.  DEMAND FOR DATA CENTER SPACE  . OUR PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF DATA CENTERS. A DECREASE IN THE DEMAND FOR, OR INCREASE IN SUPPLY OF, DATA CENTER SPACE, INTERNET GATEWAY FACILITIES OR OTHER TECHNOLOGY-RELATED REAL ESTATE WOULD HAVE A GREATER ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION THAN IF WE OWNED A PORTFOLIO WITH A MORE DIVERSIFIED CUSTOMER BASE OR LESS SPECIALIZED USE. WE HAVE INVESTED IN BUILDING OUT ADDITIONAL INVENTORY PRIMARILY IN WHAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE OUR ACTIVE MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS PRIOR TO HAVING EXECUTED LEASES WITH RESPECT TO THIS SPACE. WE BELIEVE THAT DEMAND IN KEY METROPOLITAN AREAS SUCH AS NORTHERN VIRGINIA, DALLAS, SINGAPORE AND LONDON IS LARGELY IN LINE WITH SUPPLY. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO SEE STRONG DEMAND IN OTHER KEY METROPOLITAN AREAS ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO. HOWEVER, UNTIL THIS INVENTORY IS LEASED UP, WHICH WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING AVAILABLE DATA CENTER SPACE IN THESE METROPOLITAN AREAS, OUR RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. OUR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES MAKE US PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO GENERAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWNS, INCLUDING RECESSIONS AND THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER \u201cGLOBAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS,\u201d AS WELL AS ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CORPORATE DATA CENTER, INTERNET AND DATA COMMUNICATIONS AND BROADER TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES. ANY SUCH SLOWDOWN OR ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT COULD LEAD TO REDUCED CORPORATE IT SPENDING OR REDUCED DEMAND FOR DATA CENTER SPACE. REDUCED DEMAND COULD ALSO RESULT FROM BUSINESS RELOCATIONS, INCLUDING TO METROPOLITAN AREAS THAT WE DO NOT CURRENTLY SERVE. CHANGES IN INDUSTRY PRACTICE OR IN TECHNOLOGY, SUCH AS VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGY, MORE EFFICIENT COMPUTING OR NETWORKING DEVICES, OR DEVICES THAT REQUIRE HIGHER POWER DENSITIES THAN TODAY\u2019S DEVICES, COULD ALSO REDUCE DEMAND FOR THE PHYSICAL DATA CENTER SPACE WE PROVIDE OR MAKE THE TENANT IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR FACILITIES OBSOLETE OR IN NEED OF SIGNIFICANT UPGRADES TO REMAIN VIABLE. IN ADDITION, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, THE ADOPTION OF NEW INDUSTRY STANDARDS OR OTHER FACTORS COULD RENDER MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 CURRENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OBSOLETE OR UNMARKETABLE AND CONTRIBUTE TO A DOWNTURN IN THEIR BUSINESSES, THEREBY INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY DEFAULT UNDER THEIR LEASES, BECOME INSOLVENT OR FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY. IN ADDITION, DEMAND FOR DATA CENTER SPACE, OR THE RATES AT WHICH WE LEASE SPACE, MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED EITHER ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO OR IN SPECIFIC METROPOLITAN AREAS AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, OR THE AMOUNT OF SPACE BEING OFFERED IN OUR METROPOLITAN AREAS AND OTHER METROPOLITAN AREAS BY OUR COMPETITORS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, OR GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES IN THE REPORTING PERIOD. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. WE HAVE PROVIDED A SUMMARY OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN ITEM 1, NOTE 2 \u201cSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d IN THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE DESCRIBE BELOW THOSE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REQUIRE MATERIAL SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS AND THAT HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. OUR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THESE ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS, BASED UPON INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE REASONABLE AS OF THE DATE ON THE FRONT COVER OF THIS REPORT.  INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE  ACQUISITION OF REAL ESTATE.  THE PRICE THAT WE PAY TO ACQUIRE A PROPERTY IS IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS INCLUDING THE CONDITION OF THE PROPERTY AND IMPROVEMENTS, THE OCCUPANCY OF THE BUILDING, THE TERM AND RATE OF IN-PLACE LEASES, THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE CUSTOMERS, FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE FINANCING, ABOVE- OR BELOW-MARKET GROUND LEASES AND NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS.  ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE SUBJECTIVE ASSESSMENTS TO ALLOCATE THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID TO ACQUIRE INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE AMONG THE IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS INCLUDING INTANGIBLES AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BASED ON OUR ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THIS INCLUDES DETERMINING THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY AND IMPROVEMENTS, LAND, GROUND LEASES, IF ANY, AND TENANT IMPROVEMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE EVALUATE THE VALUE OF IN-PLACE LEASES ON OCCUPANCY AND MARKET RENT, THE VALUE OF THE TENANT RELATIONSHIPS, THE VALUE (OR NEGATIVE VALUE) OF ABOVE (OR BELOW) MARKET LEASES, ANY DEBT OR DEFERRED TAXES ASSUMED FROM THE SELLER OR LOANS MADE BY THE SELLER TO US AND ANY BUILDING LEASES ASSUMED FROM THE SELLER. EACH OF THESE ESTIMATES REQUIRES A GREAT DEAL OF JUDGMENT AND SOME OF THE ESTIMATES INVOLVE COMPLEX CALCULATIONS. THESE ALLOCATION ASSESSMENTS HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE WERE TO ALLOCATE MORE VALUE TO LAND, THERE WOULD BE NO DEPRECIATION WITH RESPECT TO SUCH AMOUNT. IF WE WERE TO ALLOCATE MORE VALUE TO THE PROPERTY AS OPPOSED TO ALLOCATING TO THE VALUE OF IN-PLACE  70  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TENANT LEASES, THIS AMOUNT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS AN EXPENSE OVER A MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. THIS POTENTIAL EFFECT OCCURS BECAUSE THE AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO PROPERTY ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE PROPERTY WHEREAS AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO IN-PLACE TENANT LEASES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED TERM (INCLUDING RENEWAL AND EXTENSION ASSUMPTIONS) OF THE LEASES. ADDITIONALLY, THE AMORTIZATION OF THE VALUE (OR NEGATIVE VALUE) ASSIGNED TO ABOVE (OR BELOW) MARKET RATE LEASES IS RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO RENTAL REVENUE AS COMPARED TO AMORTIZATION OF THE VALUE OF IN-PLACE TENANT LEASES AND TENANT RELATIONSHIPS, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE WILL RECEIVE OFFERS FROM THIRD PARTIES TO PURCHASE OUR PROPERTIES, EITHER SOLICITED OR UNSOLICITED. FOR THOSE OFFERS THAT WE ACCEPT, THE PROSPECTIVE BUYERS WILL USUALLY REQUIRE A DUE DILIGENCE PERIOD BEFORE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR MATTERS TO ARISE THAT RESULT IN THE WITHDRAWAL OR REJECTION OF THE OFFER DURING THIS PROCESS. WE CLASSIFY REAL ESTATE AS \u201cHELD FOR SALE\u201d WHEN ALL CRITERIA UNDER THE GAAP GUIDANCE HAVE BEEN MET.  ASSET IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION.  WE REVIEW EACH OF OUR PROPERTIES FOR INDICATORS THAT ITS CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. EXAMPLES OF SUCH INDICATORS MAY INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF THE PROPERTY, A CHANGE IN THE EXPECTED HOLDING PERIOD FOR THE PROPERTY, A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN HOW THE PROPERTY IS BEING USED OR EXPECTED TO BE USED BASED ON THE UNDERWRITING AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION, AN ACCUMULATION OF COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT ORIGINALLY EXPECTED FOR THE ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPERTY, OR A HISTORY OF OPERATING OR CASH FLOW LOSSES OF THE PROPERTY. WHEN SUCH IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS EXIST, WE REVIEW AN ESTIMATE OF THE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS (EXCLUDING INTEREST CHARGES) EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT\u2019S USE AND EVENTUAL DISPOSITION AND COMPARE THAT ESTIMATE TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. WE CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS FUTURE OPERATING INCOME, TRENDS AND PROSPECTS, AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF LEASING DEMAND, COMPETITION AND OTHER FACTORS. IF OUR FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOW EVALUATION INDICATES THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO RECOVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. THESE LOSSES HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR NET INCOME BECAUSE RECORDING AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS RESULTS IN AN IMMEDIATE NEGATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO NET INCOME. THE EVALUATION OF ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND IS BASED IN PART ON ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING FUTURE OCCUPANCY, RENTAL RATES AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS IN FUTURE PERIODS. SINCE CASH FLOWS ON PROPERTIES CONSIDERED TO BE LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED ARE CONSIDERED ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CARRYING VALUE OF A PROPERTY IS RECOVERABLE, OUR STRATEGY OF HOLDING PROPERTIES OVER THE LONG-TERM DIRECTLY DECREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEIR CARRYING VALUES NOT BEING RECOVERABLE AND THEREFORE REQUIRING THE RECORDING OF AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS. IF OUR STRATEGY CHANGES OR MARKET CONDITIONS OTHERWISE DICTATE AN EARLIER SALE DATE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS MAY BE RECOGNIZED AND SUCH LOSS COULD BE MATERIAL. IF WE DETERMINE THAT THE ASSET FAILS THE RECOVERABILITY TEST, THE AFFECTED ASSETS MUST BE REDUCED TO THEIR FAIR VALUE.  WE GENERALLY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF RENTAL PROPERTIES UTILIZING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS THAT INCLUDES PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE REVENUES, EXPENSES AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT COSTS THAT A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD USE BASED ON THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF THE ASSET, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE INCOME APPROACH THAT IS COMMONLY UTILIZED BY APPRAISERS. IN CERTAIN CASES, WE MAY SUPPLEMENT THIS ANALYSIS BY OBTAINING OUTSIDE BROKER OPINIONS OF VALUE.  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION.  WE PERFORM AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR GOODWILL AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS, WE EVALUATE GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE.  IN OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS OF GOODWILL, WE FIRST ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE.  IF BASED ON THIS ASSESSMENT, WE DETERMINE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS NOT LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, THEN PERFORMING THE ADDITIONAL TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST IS UNNECESSARY. IF OUR QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT INDICATES THAT GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, WE PERFORM A TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT UNDER THE TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST BY FIRST COMPARING THE BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS INCLUDING GOODWILL TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN THE BOOK VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL AND ITS CARRYING VALUE. WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH WE ACCOUNT FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH TOPIC 842 COMMENCING ON JANUARY 1, 2019 AND \u201cLEASES (TOPIC 840)\u201d PRIOR TO 2019. WE ACCOUNT FOR THE NON-LEASE COMPONENTS WITHIN OUR LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, AS WELL AS OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH \u201cREVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606)\u201d.  REVENUE RECOGNIZED AS A RESULT OF APPLYING TOPIC 842 AND 840 WAS 99% AND  97%  AND TOPIC 606 WAS LESS THAN 1% AND  3%  OF TOTAL OPERATING REVENUE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  71  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR LEASES ARE CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES AND MINIMUM RENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERMS OF THE LEASES, WHICH MAY SPAN MULTIPLE YEARS. THE EXCESS OF RENTS RECOGNIZED OVER AMOUNTS CONTRACTUALLY DUE PURSUANT TO THE UNDERLYING LEASES IS INCLUDED IN DEFERRED RENT IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND CONTRACTUALLY DUE BUT UNPAID RENTS ARE INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS AND OTHER RECEIVABLES.  TENANT REIMBURSEMENTS FOR REAL ESTATE TAXES, COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE, AND OTHER RECOVERABLE COSTS UNDER OUR LEASES ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD THAT THE EXPENSES ARE INCURRED. LEASE TERMINATION FEES ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE LEASE, EFFECTIVE AS OF THE DATE THE LEASE MODIFICATION IS FINALIZED, ASSUMING COLLECTION IS NOT CONSIDERED DOUBTFUL. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE RECOGNIZE AMORTIZATION OF THE VALUE OF ACQUIRED ABOVE OR BELOW-MARKET TENANT LEASES AS A REDUCTION OF RENTAL REVENUE IN THE CASE OF ABOVE-MARKET LEASES OR AN INCREASE TO RENTAL REVENUE IN THE CASE OF BELOW-MARKET LEASES.  WE MUST MAKE SUBJECTIVE ESTIMATES AS TO WHEN OUR REVENUE IS EARNED AND THE COLLECTABILITY OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RELATED TO MINIMUM RENT, DEFERRED RENT, EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS, LEASE TERMINATION FEES AND OTHER INCOME. WE SPECIFICALLY ANALYZE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND HISTORICAL BAD DEBTS, CUSTOMER CONCENTRATIONS, CUSTOMER CREDITWORTHINESS AND CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS WHEN EVALUATING THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR BAD DEBTS. THESE ESTIMATES HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR NET REVENUE BECAUSE A HIGHER BAD DEBT ALLOWANCE WOULD RESULT IN LOWER NET REVENUE, AND RECOGNIZING RENTAL REVENUE AS EARNED IN ONE PERIOD VERSUS ANOTHER WOULD RESULT IN HIGHER OR LOWER NET REVENUE FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE PARENT COMPANY  IN THIS \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE PARENT COMPANY\u201d SECTION AND IN THE \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u201d SECTION BELOW, THE TERM OUR \u201cPARENT COMPANY\u201d REFERS TO DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. ON AN UNCONSOLIDATED BASIS, EXCLUDING OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  ANALYSIS OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PARENT COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS IS OPERATED PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, OF WHICH OUR PARENT COMPANY IS THE SOLE GENERAL PARTNER AND WHICH IT CONSOLIDATES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. BECAUSE OUR PARENT COMPANY OPERATES ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS WITH OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u201d SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS SECTION TO UNDERSTAND THE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF OUR PARENT COMPANY ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS AND HOW OUR COMPANY IS OPERATED AS A WHOLE.  OUR PARENT COMPANY ISSUES PUBLIC EQUITY FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT GENERALLY DOES NOT OTHERWISE GENERATE ANY CAPITAL ITSELF OR CONDUCT ANY BUSINESS ITSELF, OTHER THAN INCURRING CERTAIN EXPENSES IN OPERATING AS A PUBLIC COMPANY WHICH ARE FULLY REIMBURSED BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. OUR PARENT COMPANY ITSELF DOES NOT HOLD ANY INDEBTEDNESS OTHER THAN GUARANTEES OF THE INDEBTEDNESS OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND ITS ONLY MATERIAL ASSET IS ITS OWNERSHIP OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. THEREFORE, THE CONSOLIDATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE CONSOLIDATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES OF OUR PARENT COMPANY AND OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP ARE THE SAME ON THEIR RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, EXCEPT FOR IMMATERIAL DIFFERENCES RELATED TO CASH, OTHER ASSETS AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES THAT ARISE FROM PUBLIC COMPANY EXPENSES PAID BY OUR PARENT COMPANY. ALL DEBT IS HELD DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AT THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP LEVEL. OUR PARENT COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL FUNDING REQUIREMENT IS THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK. OUR PARENT COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR ITS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IS DISTRIBUTIONS IT RECEIVES FROM OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  AS THE SOLE GENERAL PARTNER OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, OUR PARENT COMPANY HAS THE FULL, EXCLUSIVE AND COMPLETE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S DAY-TO-DAY MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL. OUR PARENT COMPANY CAUSES OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO DISTRIBUTE SUCH PORTION OF ITS AVAILABLE CASH AS OUR PARENT COMPANY MAY IN ITS DISCRETION DETERMINE, IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT. OUR PARENT COMPANY RECEIVES PROCEEDS FROM ITS EQUITY ISSUANCES FROM TIME TO TIME, BUT IS GENERALLY REQUIRED BY OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT TO CONTRIBUTE THE PROCEEDS FROM ITS EQUITY ISSUANCES TO OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP IN EXCHANGE FOR PARTNERSHIP UNITS OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  OUR PARENT COMPANY IS A WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER WITH AN EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED ON SEPTEMBER 22, 2017, WHICH ALLOWS OUR PARENT COMPANY TO REGISTER AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF VARIOUS CLASSES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, OUR PARENT COMPANY MAY ISSUE EQUITY FROM TIME TO TIME ON AN OPPORTUNISTIC BASIS, DEPENDENT UPON MARKET CONDITIONS AND AVAILABLE PRICING. ANY PROCEEDS FROM SUCH EQUITY ISSUANCES WOULD GENERALLY BE CONTRIBUTED TO OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP IN EXCHANGE FOR ADDITIONAL EQUITY INTERESTS IN OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP MAY USE THE PROCEEDS TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES, TO FUND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND FOR GENERAL WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES, INCLUDING POTENTIALLY FOR THE REPURCHASE, REDEMPTION OR RETIREMENT OF OUTSTANDING DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES.  THE LIQUIDITY OF OUR PARENT COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S ABILITY TO MAKE SUFFICIENT DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PARENT COMPANY. THE PRIMARY CASH REQUIREMENT OF OUR PARENT COMPANY IS ITS PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS. OUR PARENT COMPANY ALSO GUARANTEES OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 AND AFFILIATES\u2019, UNSECURED DEBT. IF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP OR SUCH SUBSIDIARIES FAIL TO FULFILL THEIR DEBT REQUIREMENTS, WHICH TRIGGER PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS, THEN OUR PARENT COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL ITS CASH PAYMENT COMMITMENTS UNDER SUCH GUARANTEES. HOWEVER, OUR PARENT COMPANY\u2019S ONLY MATERIAL ASSET IS ITS INVESTMENT IN OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  WE BELIEVE OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S SOURCES OF WORKING CAPITAL, SPECIFICALLY ITS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AND FUNDS AVAILABLE UNDER ITS GLOBAL REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ARE ADEQUATE FOR IT TO MAKE ITS DISTRIBUTION PAYMENTS TO OUR PARENT COMPANY AND, IN TURN, FOR OUR PARENT COMPANY TO MAKE ITS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S SOURCES OF CAPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE AT ALL OR IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS NEEDS, INCLUDING MAKING DISTRIBUTION PAYMENTS TO OUR PARENT COMPANY. THE LACK OF AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S ABILITY TO PAY ITS DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PARENT COMPANY, WHICH WOULD IN TURN, ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PARENT COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS.  76  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON JANUARY 4, 2019, OUR PARENT COMPANY ENTERED INTO EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS, WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE 2019 EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS, WITH EACH OF MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED, BARCLAYS CAPITAL INC., BTIG, LLC, CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES (USA) LLC, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES INC., J.P.

SALES MAY ALSO BE MADE ON A FORWARD BASIS PURSUANT TO SEPARATE FORWARD SALE AGREEMENTS. THE SALES OF COMMON STOCK MADE UNDER THE 2019 EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WILL BE MADE IN \u201cAT THE MARKET\u201d OFFERINGS AS DEFINED IN RULE 415 OF THE SECURITIES ACT. TO DATE, NO SALES HAVE BEEN MADE UNDER THE PROGRAM.  ON MARCH 13, 2019 AND MARCH 15, 2019, OUR PARENT COMPANY COMPLETED AN UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC OFFERING OF 8,400,000 SHARES IN THE AGGREGATE OF ITS 5.850% SERIES K CUMULATIVE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $203.4 MILLION AFTER DEDUCTING THE UNDERWRITING DISCOUNT AND OTHER ESTIMATED EXPENSES PAYABLE BY OUR PARENT COMPANY.  FUTURE USES OF CASH  OUR PARENT COMPANY MAY FROM TIME TO TIME SEEK TO RETIRE, REDEEM OR REPURCHASE ITS EQUITY OR THE DEBT SECURITIES OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES THROUGH CASH PURCHASES AND/OR EXCHANGES FOR EQUITY SECURITIES IN OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS OR OTHERWISE. SUCH REPURCHASES, REDEMPTIONS OR EXCHANGES, IF ANY, WILL DEPEND ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS OR OTHER FACTORS. THE AMOUNTS INVOLVED MAY BE MATERIAL.  WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE COMMITMENTS DISCUSSED BELOW UNDER \u201cDIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.\u201d  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS  OUR PARENT COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE  90%  OF ITS TAXABLE INCOME (EXCLUDING CAPITAL GAINS) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IN ORDER FOR IT TO CONTINUE TO QUALIFY AS A REIT FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR PARENT COMPANY INTENDS TO MAKE, BUT IS NOT CONTRACTUALLY BOUND TO MAKE, REGULAR QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS FROM CASH FLOW FROM OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S OPERATING ACTIVITIES. WHILE HISTORICALLY OUR PARENT COMPANY HAS SATISFIED THIS DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT BY MAKING CASH DISTRIBUTIONS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS, IT MAY CHOOSE TO SATISFY THIS REQUIREMENT BY MAKING DISTRIBUTIONS OF CASH OR OTHER PROPERTY. ALL SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS ARE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR PARENT COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OUR PARENT COMPANY CONSIDERS MARKET FACTORS AND OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S PERFORMANCE IN ADDITION TO REIT REQUIREMENTS IN DETERMINING DISTRIBUTION LEVELS. OUR PARENT COMPANY HAS DISTRIBUTED AT LEAST 100% OF ITS TAXABLE INCOME ANNUALLY SINCE INCEPTION TO MINIMIZE CORPORATE LEVEL FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. AMOUNTS ACCUMULATED FOR DISTRIBUTION TO STOCKHOLDERS ARE INVESTED PRIMARILY IN INTEREST-BEARING ACCOUNTS AND SHORT-TERM INTEREST-BEARING SECURITIES, WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR INTENTION TO MAINTAIN OUR PARENT COMPANY\u2019S STATUS AS A REIT.  AS A RESULT OF THIS DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT, OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP CANNOT RELY ON RETAINED EARNINGS TO FUND ITS ON-GOING OPERATIONS TO THE SAME EXTENT THAT OTHER COMPANIES WHOSE PARENT COMPANIES ARE NOT REITS CAN. OUR PARENT COMPANY MAY NEED TO CONTINUE TO RAISE CAPITAL IN THE DEBT AND EQUITY MARKETS TO FUND OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS AT NEW OR EXISTING PROPERTIES, ACQUISITIONS OR INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING OR NEWLY CREATED JOINT VENTURES. IN ADDITION, OUR PARENT COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO USE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR GLOBAL REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, IF NECESSARY, TO MEET REIT DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS AND MAINTAIN OUR PARENT COMPANY\u2019S REIT STATUS.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES HAS BEEN GENERALLY SUFFICIENT TO FUND DISTRIBUTIONS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, HOWEVER, WE MAY ALSO NEED TO UTILIZE BORROWINGS UNDER THE GLOBAL REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO FUND DISTRIBUTIONS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP  IN THIS \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u201d SECTION, THE TERMS \u201cWE\u201d, \u201cOUR\u201d AND \u201cUS\u201d REFER TO OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES OR OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND OUR PARENT COMPANY TOGETHER WITH THEIR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, AS THE CONTEXT REQUIRES.  ANALYSIS OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PARENT COMPANY IS OUR SOLE GENERAL PARTNER AND CONSOLIDATES OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. BECAUSE WE OPERATE ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS WITH OUR PARENT COMPANY, THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE PARENT COMPANY\u201d SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS SECTION TO UNDERSTAND OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  $123.9 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, EXCLUDING $10.1 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH. RESTRICTED CASH PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF CONTRACTUAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES PLUS OTHER DEPOSITS.  OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF OPERATING EXPENSES, DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND OTHER EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PROPERTIES, DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PARENT COMPANY IN ORDER FOR IT TO MAKE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON ITS PREFERRED STOCK, DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PARENT COMPANY IN ORDER FOR IT TO MAKE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ITS REIT STATUS, DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNITHOLDERS OF COMMON LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS IN DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, L.P., CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE ON OUR LOANS AND SENIOR NOTES, AND, POTENTIALLY, ACQUISITIONS. WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS THROUGH NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS, RESTRICTED CASH ACCOUNTS ESTABLISHED FOR CERTAIN FUTURE PAYMENTS AND BY DRAWING UPON OUR GLOBAL REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.

THE GROWING ACCEPTANCE BY PRIVATE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS OF THE DATA CENTER ASSET CLASS HAS GENERALLY PUSHED CAPITALIZATION RATES LOWER, AS SUCH PRIVATE INVESTORS MAY OFTEN HAVE LOWER RETURN EXPECTATIONS THAN US.

CAMPUS, TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER COSTS INCLUDE THE VALUE OF DEVELOPMENT WORK WHICH BENEFITS SPACE RECENTLY CONVERTED TO OUR OPERATING PORTFOLIO AND IS COMPOSED PRIMARILY OF SHARED INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND FIRST-GENERATION TENANT IMPROVEMENTS.  FUTURE USES OF CASH  OUR PROPERTIES REQUIRE PERIODIC INVESTMENTS OF CAPITAL FOR TENANT-RELATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND FOR GENERAL CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  3.2 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROXIMATELY  2.1 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF SPACE HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN OPERATING PARTNERSHIP  NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS RELATE TO THE COMMON UNITS IN OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP THAT ARE NOT OWNED BY DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC., WHICH, AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , AMOUNTED TO  4.4%  OF OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP COMMON UNITS. HISTORICALLY, OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP HAS ISSUED COMMON UNITS TO THIRD PARTY SELLERS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF REAL ESTATE INTERESTS FROM SUCH THIRD PARTIES.  LIMITED PARTNERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO REDEEM PART OR ALL OF THEIR COMMON UNITS FOR CASH BASED UPON THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF SHARES OF DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME OF THE REDEMPTION. ALTERNATIVELY, WE MAY ELECT TO ACQUIRE THOSE COMMON UNITS IN EXCHANGE FOR SHARES OF DIGITAL REALTY TRUST, INC. COMMON STOCK ON A ONE-FOR-ONE BASIS, SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT IN THE EVENT OF STOCK SPLITS, STOCK DIVIDENDS, ISSUANCE OF STOCK RIGHTS, SPECIFIED EXTRAORDINARY DISTRIBUTIONS AND SIMILAR EVENTS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE DFT MERGER, APPROXIMATELY 0.2 MILLION COMMON UNITS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP WERE ISSUED TO CERTAIN FORMER UNITHOLDERS IN THE DFT OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS AND, ACCORDINGLY, ARE NOT PRESENTED AS PERMANENT CAPITAL IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.  INFLATION  MANY OF OUR LEASES PROVIDE FOR SEPARATE REAL ESTATE TAX AND OPERATING EXPENSE ESCALATIONS. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE LEASES PROVIDE FOR FIXED BASE RENT INCREASES. WE BELIEVE THAT INFLATIONARY INCREASES MAY BE AT LEAST PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CONTRACTUAL RENT INCREASES AND EXPENSE ESCALATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS  WE CALCULATE FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, OR FFO, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (NAREIT). FFO REPRESENTS NET INCOME (LOSS) (COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP), EXCLUDING GAINS (OR LOSSES) FROM SALES OF PROPERTY, A GAIN FROM A PRE-EXISTING RELATIONSHIP, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND REAL ESTATE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS) AND AFTER ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES. MANAGEMENT USES FFO AS A SUPPLEMENTAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE BECAUSE, IN EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND GAINS AND LOSSES FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS AND AFTER ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES, IT PROVIDES A PERFORMANCE MEASURE THAT, WHEN COMPARED YEAR OVER YEAR, CAPTURES TRENDS IN OCCUPANCY RATES, RENTAL RATES AND OPERATING COSTS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT, AS A WIDELY RECOGNIZED MEASURE OF THE PERFORMANCE OF REITS, FFO WILL BE USED BY INVESTORS AS A BASIS TO COMPARE OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE WITH THAT OF OTHER REITS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE FFO EXCLUDES DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND CAPTURES NEITHER THE CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF OUR PROPERTIES THAT RESULT FROM USE OR MARKET CONDITIONS, NOR THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND CAPITALIZED LEASING COMMISSIONS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPERTIES, ALL OF WHICH HAVE REAL ECONOMIC EFFECT AND COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS, THE UTILITY OF FFO AS A MEASURE OF OUR PERFORMANCE IS LIMITED. OTHER REITS MAY NOT CALCULATE FFO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NAREIT DEFINITION AND, ACCORDINGLY, OUR FFO MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO  83  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SUCH OTHER REITS\u2019 FFO. FFO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY AS A SUPPLEMENT TO NET INCOME COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AS A MEASURE OF OUR PERFORMANCE.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  ASTROTECH CORPORATION (NASDAQ: ASTC) (\u201cASTROTECH,\u201d THE \u201cCOMPANY,\u201d \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cUS,\u201d OR \u201cOUR\u201d), A DELAWARE CORPORATION ORGANIZED IN 1984, IS A SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION COMPANY THAT LAUNCHES, MANAGES, AND BUILDS SCALABLE COMPANIES BASED ON INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE SHAREHOLDER VALUE.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY OPERATES TWO REPORTABLE BUSINESS UNITS, 1  ST  DETECT CORPORATION AND ASTRAL IMAGES CORPORATION, AND THEIR EFFORTS ARE FOCUSED ON THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  1  ST  DETECT CORPORATION (\u201c1  ST  DETECT\u201d) IS A MANUFACTURER OF EXPLOSIVES AND NARCOTICS TRACE DETECTORS DEVELOPED FOR USE AT AIRPORTS, SECURED FACILITIES, AND BORDERS WORLDWIDE.  \u2022  ASTRAL IMAGES CORPORATION (\u201cASTRAL\u201d) IS A DEVELOPER OF ADVANCED FILM RESTORATION AND ENHANCEMENT SOFTWARE.  OUR BUSINESS UNITS  1  ST  DETECT CORPORATION  1  ST  DETECT CORPORATION HAS DEVELOPED A SMALL, LABORATORY-PERFORMANCE MASS SPECTROMETER (\u201cMS\u201d) DESIGNED TO REPLACE THE EXPLOSIVES AND NARCOTICS TRACE DETECTORS USED AT AIRPORTS, SECURED FACILITIES, AND BORDERS WORLDWIDE. WE BELIEVE THAT GOVERNMENT AND AIRPORT CUSTOMERS ARE UNSATISFIED WITH THE CURRENTLY DEPLOYED EXPLOSIVES TRACE DETECTOR (\u201cETD\u201d) TECHNOLOGY, WHICH IS DRIVEN BY AN ANTIQUATED TECHNOLOGY KNOWN AS ION MOBILITY SPECTROMETRY (\u201cIMS\u201d). IMS-BASED ETDS ARE FRAUGHT WITH FALSE POSITIVES, AS THEY OFTEN MISIDENTIFY COMMON HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS AS EXPLOSIVES, CAUSING UNNECESSARY PASSENGER DELAYS, SIGNIFICANT WASTED SECURITY RESOURCES, AND LACK OF SECURITY PERSONNEL CONFIDENCE IN ETDS. IN ADDITION, IMS-BASED ETDS HAVE A VERY LIMITED THREAT DETECTION LIBRARY RESERVED ONLY FOR THOSE EXPLOSIVES OF LARGEST CONCERN. WITH TERRORIST THREATS BECOMING MORE NUMEROUS, SOPHISTICATED, AND LETHAL, SECURITY PROFESSIONALS HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR BETTER INSTRUMENTATION TO ADDRESS THE EVOLVING THREATS. MS COULD PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION, BUT IT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN RESERVED FOR HIGHLY TRAINED PROFESSIONALS IN HIGH-END LABORATORIES WITH LARGE BUDGETS. 1  ST  DETECT HAS OVERCOME THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE OF MAKING THIS SOPHISTICATED MS TECHNOLOGY POWERFUL, YET SIMPLE TO USE, WITH AN EASY TO UNDERSTAND RED LIGHT OR GREEN LIGHT OUTPUT, AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE. IN ADDITION TO AN INCREASED PROBABILITY OF DETECTION, DECREASED FALSE ALARM RATE, AND A VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED THREAT LIBRARY THAT IS FIELD-UPGRADABLE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE 1  ST  DETECT ETD CAN INCREASE PASSENGER THROUGHPUT AND SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN WASTED AIRPORT SECURITY PERSONNEL RESOURCES. WITH MORE THAN 30,000 IMS INSTRUMENTS INSTALLED IN THE FIELD, MANY OF WHICH ARE NEARING THEIR END OF LIFE OR ARE UNABLE TO BE UPDATED TO THE NEWEST STANDARDS, 1  ST  DETECT IS POSITIONED TO BE A LEADER IN SECURING WORLDWIDE CHECKPOINTS.  EITHER TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (\u201cTSA\u201d) OR EUROPEAN CIVIL AVIATION CONFERENCE (\u201cECAC\u201d) CERTIFICATION IS NECESSARY TO SELL THE TRACER 1000 TO THE AIRPORT MARKET. ON JUNE 19, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT THE TRACER 1000 HAD ENTERED THE ECAC COMMON EVALUATION PROCESS (\u201cCEP\u201d) TO OBTAIN CERTIFICATION IN EUROPE. ON DECEMBER 12, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT THE TRACER 1000 PASSED THE ECAC CEP TESTS FOR AIRPORT CHECKPOINT SCREENING OF PASSENGERS. ON JANUARY 9, 2019, THE COMPANY SUBSEQUENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT THE TRACER 1000 PASSED THE CEP TESTS FOR AIRPORT CARGO SCREENING. FINALLY, ON FEBRUARY 21, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT 1  ST  DETECT RECEIVED ECAC CERTIFICATION FOR BOTH PASSENGER AND CARGO SCREENING FOR THE TRACER 1000, AND THE COMPANY CAN NOW BEGIN SELLING ITS PRODUCT INTERNATIONALLY. THE TRACER 1000 IS THE FIRST MS-BASED ETD TO HAVE EVER PASSED EITHER U.S. OR EUROPEAN REGULATORY TESTING.  IN ADDITION, ON MARCH 27, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT THE TRACER 1000 WAS ACCEPTED INTO TSA\u2019S AIR CARGO SCREENING TECHNOLOGY QUALIFICATION TEST (\u201cACSQT\u201d) AND, ON APRIL 4, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT THE TRACER 1000 WAS BEGINNING TESTING WITH TSA FOR PASSENGER SCREENING AT AIRPORTS. BOTH PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY PROGRESSING AS EXPECTED.  WITH TSA AND ECAC HAVING TWO OF THE MOST RIGOROUS TECHNOLOGY REVIEW PROGRAMS FOR ETDS IN THE WORLD, WE BELIEVE CERTIFICATION BY EITHER PROGRAM IS A SIGNIFICANT ENDORSEMENT THAT CUSTOMERS IN OTHER VERTICAL MARKETS CONSIDER WHEN PROCURING ETDS.  THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THE FURTHER STEPS DETAILED ABOVE WILL BE ACHIEVED OR THAT OUR TECHNOLOGY WILL BE APPROVED BY ANY OF THE PROGRAMS.  17  ASTRAL IMAGES CORPORATION  ASTRAL IMAGES IS A DEVELOPER OF ADVANCED FILM RESTORATION AND ENHANCEMENT SOFTWARE. ASTRAL\u2019S INTELLIGENT ALGORITHMS REMOVE DUST, SCRATCHES, AND DEFECTS FROM FILM WHILE CONVERTING THE CONTENT TO A DIGITAL FORMAT WITH SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED RESOLUTION. IN ADDITION, ASTRAL EMPLOYS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO AUTOMATICALLY EXTEND THE COLOR GAMUT AND ENHANCE THE DYNAMIC RANGE TO BE VIEWED IN 4K AND/OR HIGH-DYNAMIC RANGE (\u201cHDR\u201d), COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS ULTRA-HIGH DEFINITION (\u201cUHD\u201d).  ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE ASTRAL HAS DEVELOPED VALUABLE TECHNOLOGY FORTIFIED BY PATENTS AND TRADE SECRETS, THE POTENTIAL MARKET HAS NOT EVOLVED AS QUICKLY AS ANTICIPATED. DUE TO FUNDING CONSTRAINTS, THE COMPANY\u2019S MAIN FOCUS REMAINS ON THE 1  ST  DETECT OPPORTUNITY. CONSEQUENTLY, HEADCOUNT AND EXPENDITURES AT ASTRAL ARE MINIMIZED AND NEW DEVELOPMENT IS EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSED ON STRATEGIC INITIATIVES THAT WOULD FACILITATE THE REALIZATION OF ASTRAL\u2019S VALUE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 TO THE ITEMS THAT WE DISCLOSED AS OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  .

ALL OF THE REVENUE GENERATED DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S NOW-DISCONTINUED AGREEMENT WITH COLORTIME, A POST-PRODUCTION HOUSE SPECIALIZING IN MEDIA CONTENT CREATION, RESTORATION, AND DISTRIBUTION.  THE REVENUE GENERATED DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WAS FROM A SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH A LARGE POST-PRODUCTION FILM COMPANY. THIS AGREEMENT WAS USED TO CORRECT DEFECTS AND RESTORE ONE FILM.  GROSS PROFIT  \u2013 GROSS PROFIT IS COMPRISED OF REVENUE LESS COST OF REVENUE. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COST OF REVENUE WAS COMPRISED OF LABOR RELATED TO THE AGREEMENT WITH COLORTIME. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COST OF REVENUES DECREASED $13 THOUSAND, COMPARED TO  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  , AND GROSS PROFIT INCREASED $12 THOUSAND DURING THE SAME PERIOD DUE TO THE DECREASE IN COST OF REVENUE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  OPERATING EXPENSES  \u2013 AS A RESULT OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S ONGOING COMMITMENT TO OPTIMIZE OUR AVAILABLE RESOURCES, OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED $2.4 MILLION, OR 27%, DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  . SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE DECREASED $0.7 MILLION, OR 17%, DUE TO DECREASES IN EXPENSES RELATING TO LEGAL, LOBBYING, DIRECTORS\u2019 FEES, OFFICE RENT, EQUITY COMPENSATION, AND HEADCOUNT. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DECREASED $1.7 MILLION, OR 36%, DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED HEADCOUNT AND LESS DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.  INCOME TAXES  \u2013 INCOME TAX BENEFIT INCREASED $858 THOUSAND DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018,  DUE TO THE AMT CREDIT FROM THE REMOVAL OF THE AMT IN THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE CHANGE IN OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  NINE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  CHANGE  CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(6,550  )  $(8,641  )  $2,091  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  3,597  7,093  (3,496  )  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  3,925  (3  )  3,928  NET CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $972  $(1,551  )  $2,523  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HELD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $1.5 MILLION, AND OUR WORKING CAPITAL WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2018, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $0.6 MILLION, AND OUR WORKING CAPITAL WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.3 MILLION. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $1.0 MILLION AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO JUNE  19  30, 2018  , DUE TO  A  PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF EQUITY SECURITIES  , THE SALE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK  THROUGH  AN \u201cAT THE MARKET OFFERING\u201d PROGRAM (THE \u201cATM OFFERING\u201d)  ,  AND THE SALE AND/OR MATURITIES OF OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  FUNDING OUR NORMAL OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOP  MENT INITIATIVES.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $2.1 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, PRIMARILY CAUSED BY A REDUCTION IN OUR EXPENSES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $3.5 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, DUE TO FEWER MATURITIES AND SALES OF OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $3.9 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED TO CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $3 THOUSAND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THIS CHANGE WAS DUE TO A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF EQUITY SECURITIES ON OCTOBER 9, 2018 AS WELL AS THE SALE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH THE ATM OFFERING.  LIQUIDITY  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $1.5 MILLION, AND OUR WORKING CAPITAL WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018, THE COMPANY REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $13.3 MILLION AND NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $10.8 MILLION. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $5.8 MILLION AND NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $6.6 MILLION. THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  THE COMPANY REMAINS RESOLUTE IN IDENTIFYING THE OPTIMAL SOLUTION TO ITS LIQUIDITY ISSUE. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING SEVERAL POTENTIAL SOURCES FOR ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY. THESE INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SELLING THE COMPANY OR A PORTION THEREOF, DEBT FINANCING, EQUITY FINANCING, MERGING, OR ENGAGING IN A STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP. ON JULY 3, 2018, MANAGEMENT FILED FORM S-3 TO RAISE FUNDS THROUGH THE CAPITAL MARKETS.  ON OCTOBER 9, 2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cAGREEMENT NO. 1\u201d) WITH THOMAS B. PICKENS III, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, AND A LONG-TERM ACCREDITED INVESTOR IN THE COMPANY (THE \u201cINVESTOR\u201d).  PURSUANT  TO AGREEMENT NO. 1, THE COMPANY AGREED TO SELL AN AGGREGATE OF 866,950 SHARES OF ITS SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.001 PER SHARE (THE \u201cSERIES B PREFERRED SHARES\u201d) TO MR.

THE PURCHASE PRICE OF $2.35 PER SHARE WAS EQUAL TO THE CLOSING PRICE ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET ON OCTOBER 8, 2018. THE SERIES B PREFERRED SHARES CONVERTED INTO AN AGGREGATE OF 866,950  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK  ON DECEMBER 7, 2018 UPON  RECEIPT  OF SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH NASDAQ LISTING RULE 5635(B).  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAS SOLD 205,540 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO AN AT THE MARKET ISSUANCE SALES AGREEMENT WITH B. RILEY FBR THROUGH THE ATM OFFERING UNDER WHICH B. RILEY FBR ACTS AS SALES AGENT. A PROSPECTUS RELATING TO THE ATM OFFERING WAS FILED WITH THE SEC ON NOVEMBER 9, 2018. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF THESE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, THE COMPANY HAS RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF $998,057. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE SALE PRICE PER SHARE WAS $5.11. ON APRIL 17, 2019, THE COMPANY  ENTERED INTO ANOTHER SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cAGREEMENT NO. 2\u201d) WITH MR. PICKENS AND THE INVESTOR.  PURSUANT  TO AGREEMENT NO. 2, THE COMPANY AGREED TO SELL AN AGGREGATE OF 280,898 SHARES OF ITS SERIES C CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.001 PER SHARE (THE \u201cSERIES C PREFERRED SHARES\u201d) TO THE INVESTOR AND 280,898 OF ITS SERIES D CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.001 PER SHARE (THE \u201cSERIES D PREFERRED SHARES\u201d) TO MR. PICKENS, AT A PRICE PER SHARE OF $3.56 AND FOR AGGREGATE GROSS PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $2.0 MILLION. THE PURCHASE PRICE OF $3.56 PER SHARE WAS EQUAL TO THE CLOSING CONSOLIDATED BID PRICE ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET ON APRIL 16, 2019.  THE HOLDER OF THE SERIES C PREFERRED SHARES HAS AGREED TO RESTRICT ITS ABILITY TO CONVERT THE SERIES C PREFERRED SHARES SUCH THAT THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK HELD BY SUCH HOLDER AND ITS AFFILIATES AFTER SUCH CONVERSION DOES NOT EXCEED 9.99% OF THE COMPANY\u2019S THEN ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. THE SERIES D PREFERRED SHARES ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO AN AGGREGATE OF 280,898 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER.  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING POTENTIAL OFFERINGS OF  ANY COMBINATION OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT SECURITIES, WARRANTS TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK OR DEBT SECURITIES, OR ANY COMBINATION OF THE FOREGOING, EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR AS UNITS COMPRISED OF ONE OR MORE OF THE OTHER SECURITIES. HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED OR ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO GENERATE FUNDING WITHIN A REASONABLE TIMEFRAME, WE MAY HAVE TO DELAY, REDUCE OR  20  TERMINATE OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, LIMIT STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES, OR CURTAIL OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.  ASTROTECH\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIG  HT RESULT FROM THE  OUTCOME OF THIS UNCERTAINTY.  INCOME TAXES  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR INCOME TAXES UNDER THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR REPORTED AMOUNTS. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED, WHEN NECESSARY, TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO AMOUNTS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST MOST OF ITS NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2018, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST ALL OF ITS NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, THE COMPANY INCURRED PRE-TAX LOSSES IN THE AMOUNT OF $2.3 MILLION AND $2.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, THE COMPANY INCURRED PRE-TAX LOSSES IN THE AMOUNT OF $6.6 MILLION AND $9.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE TOTAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS APPROXIMATELY 38% AND 13% FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE TOTAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS APPROXIMATELY 0% FOR EACH OF THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DIFFERED FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 21% DUE TO THE AMT CREDIT REFERENCED BELOW. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DIFFERED FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 21% DUE TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE PLACED AGAINST ITS NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OFFSET BY THE AMT CREDIT. FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DIFFERED FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 28%, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE PLACED AGAINST ITS NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017. THE ACT REDUCES THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, REQUIRES COMPANIES TO PAY A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY TAX DEFERRED, AND CREATES NEW TAXES ON CERTAIN FOREIGN SOURCED EARNINGS. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY REVISED ITS ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE RATE TO REFLECT A CHANGE IN ITS FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE FROM 35% TO 21%. THE RATE CHANGE WAS EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2018; THEREFORE, THE COMPANY\u2019S BLENDED STATUTORY TAX RATE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 WAS 28%. THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ALSO REMOVED THE AMT AND THEREFORE ANY AMT PREVIOUSLY PAID WILL BE A REFUNDABLE CREDIT. THE AMT CREDIT WILL BE REFUNDED 50% IN THE CURRENT YEAR FOR AN AMOUNT OF $429 THOUSAND. THE REMAINING AMT AMOUNT WILL BE DEFERRED AND RECEIVED ACCORDING TO THE PERCENTAGE SCHEDULE SET FORTH BY THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT UNTIL ALL THE AMT AMOUNT IS PAID IN FULL BY 2021. DUE TO THIS, THE COMPANY HAS A CURRENT FEDERAL INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $429 THOUSAND AND A DEFERRED FEDERAL INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $429 THOUSAND FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) 740, \u201cINCOME TAXES\u201d ADDRESSES THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAX RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PRESCRIBES A RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCLOSURE OF TAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN ON A TAX RETURN. THE COMPANY HAD NO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFIT FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018.  LOSS CARRYOVERS ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO MODIFICATION BY TAX AUTHORITIES UNTIL THREE YEARS AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN UTILIZED; AS SUCH, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED 2000 THROUGH PRESENT FOR FEDERAL PURPOSES AND FISCAL YEARS ENDED 2006 THROUGH PRESENT FOR STATE PURPOSES. THE REASON FOR THIS EXTENDED EXAMINATION PERIOD IS DUE TO THE UTILIZATION OF THE LOSS CARRYOVERS GENERATED BY THE SALE OF OUR ASTROTECH SPACE OPERATIONS BUSINESS UNIT IN FISCAL YEAR 2015.

OUR DEVICE SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT MARGIN INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY REDUCED OVERHEAD EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF JUNE 2018 RE-ORGANIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY $250,000 AND LOWER DISPOSABLE COSTS THROUGH PRICE EFFICIENCIES FROM CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OF APPROXIMATELY $200,000. THE REMAINDER OF THE INCREASE IS DUE PRIMARILY TO REVENUE RECOGNIZED UNDER A SILVER SERVICE CONTRACT AT THE END OF THE AGREEMENT WITHOUT ANY A CORRESPONDING COST OF GOODS EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $90,000, INCREASED OVERHEAD ABSORPTION DUE TO A HIGHER VOLUME OF GOODS PRODUCED PRIMARILY IN THE CAR-TXPRESS PRODUCT LINE OF APPROXIMATELY $100,000 AND INCREASED CAR-TXPRESS AND INCREASED SALES OF CAR-TXPRESS, WHICH RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL GROSS PROFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $150,000.  SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES  CONSOLIDATED SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES OF $341,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 OF $325,000. PREDOMINANTLY ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES ARE GENERATED BY THE DEVICE SEGMENT.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  CONSOLIDATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE $563,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO $1,041,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, A DECREASE OF $478,000 OR 46%. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES IN OUR DEVICE SEGMENT DECREASED $326,000 WHILE OUR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT SEGMENT DECREASED $152,000. THE CHANGES ARE DUE TO A DECLINE IN PERSONNEL COSTS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE JUNE 2018 REORGANIZATION AND REDUCED SPENDING ON R&D PROJECTS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  CONSOLIDATED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WERE $1,260,000, COMPARED TO $2,242,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, A DECREASE OF $982,000 OR 44%. THE DECREASE IS DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN PERSONNEL COSTS DUE TO THE JUNE AND OCTOBER 2018 REORGANIZATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $300,000, REDUCED LEGAL EXPENSES PRIMARILY DUE TO MAVERICKS LEGAL COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $200,000, ELIMINATING BONUSES IN THE CURRENT YEAR RESULTING IN COST SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $100,000 FOR THE FIRST QUARTER AND REDUCED STOCK COMPENSATION AND PROFESSIONAL FEES EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $50,000 EACH.  INTEREST EXPENSE  CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $1,132,000. THIS REPRESENTS A $771,000 OR 68% INCREASE OVER INTEREST EXPENSE OF $361,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE INCREASE IS DRIVEN BY $586,000 DUE TO THE AMORTIZATION OF THE BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE OF THE RELATED PARTY NOT PAYABLE. THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 HAD AMORTIZATION OF $0 AS THE BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE WAS RECOGNIZED UNTIL THE MAY OF 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $2,237,000 AND WORKING CAPITAL OF $3,246,000. THIS COMPARES TO CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $2,400,000 AND WORKING CAPITAL OF $2,261,000 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. WE HAVE PRIMARILY FINANCED OPERATIONS THROUGH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PLACEMENT OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND OUR LINE OF CREDIT FACILITY.  THE COMPANY HAS A REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH BOYALIFE ASSET HOLDING II, INC. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD DRAWN DOWN $8,713,000 OF THE $10,000,000 AVAILABLE UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. FUTURE DRAW-DOWNS MAY BE LIMITED FOR VARIOUS REASONS INCLUDING DEFAULT OR FOREIGN GOVERNMENT POLICIES THAT RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT TRANSFERRING FUNDS. AT THE TIME OF THIS FILING, WE ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO DRAW DOWN ON THE LINE OF CREDIT. THIS MAY CHANGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE LINE OF CREDIT WILL BECOME AVAILABLE AT SUCH TIME WHEN IT IS NEEDED. BOYALIFE ASSET HOLDING II, INC. IS A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF BOYALIFE GROUP INC., WHICH IS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY THE COMPANY\u2019S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD.  THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED RECURRING OPERATING LOSSES AND AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $229,306,000. THESE CONDITIONS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE ISSUANCE DATE. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES REQUIRING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO GROW THE DEVICE BUSINESS, TO FUND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES AND TO MAKE INTEREST PAYMENTS ON THE LINE OF CREDIT WITH BOYALIFE. THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO FUND ITS CASH NEEDS IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL. THE COMPANY PLANS TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH BANK BORROWINGS OR PUBLIC OR PRIVATE SALES OF DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES OR STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS. THE COMPANY CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT SUCH FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE ON A TIMELY BASIS, IN NEEDED QUANTITIES OR ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US, IF AT ALL.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "CESCA THERAPEUTICS INC.", "CIK": 811212, "Date": "2019-05-14T00:00:00", "Ticker": "THMO", "Name": "Thermogenesis Corp", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 3821.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 943018487.0, "key": "20190514THMO", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": -3.703703703703707, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.46144809999999997, "prof1": 0.53855187, "return1&2": 1.0, "return1&2&3": 1.0, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9629629629629628, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 0.9629629629629628, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.7620769225519006, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.6639449406648853, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.053597176614124414, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.023212654498823572, "indexx": 1174, "cumreturn1b": 0.3833258404558241, "cumreturndow": 0.975110554155894, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9704079859015129}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1199, "level_0": 2390, "index": 87597, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  . ICONIX BRAND GROUP IS A BRAND MANAGEMENT COMPANY AND OWNER OF A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF APPROXIMATELY 30 GLOBAL CONSUMER BRANDS ACROSS WOMEN\u2019S, MEN\u2019S, HOME AND INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRY SEGMENTS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS STRATEGY IS TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF ITS BRANDS PRIMARILY THROUGH STRATEGIC LICENSES AND JOINT VENTURE PARTNERSHIPS AROUND THE WORLD, AS WELL AS TO GROW THE PORTFOLIO OF BRANDS THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S BRAND PORTFOLIO INCLUDES CANDIE\u2019S  \u00ae  , BONGO  \u00ae  , JOE BOXER  \u00ae  , RAMPAGE  \u00ae  , MUDD  \u00ae  , LONDON FOG  \u00ae  , MOSSIMO  \u00ae  , OCEAN PACIFIC/OP  \u00ae  , DANSKIN /DANSKIN NOW  \u00ae  , ROCAWEAR  \u00ae  /ROC NATION  \u00ae  , ARTFUL DODGER  \u00ae  , CANNON  \u00ae  , ROYAL VELVET  \u00ae  , FIELDCREST  \u00ae  , CHARISMA  \u00ae  , STARTER  \u00ae  , WAVERLY  \u00ae  , ECKO UNLTD  \u00ae  /MARK ECKO CUT & SEW  \u00ae  , ZOO YORK  \u00ae  , UMBRO  \u00ae  AND LEE COOPER  \u00ae  ; AND INTERESTS IN MATERIAL GIRL  \u00ae  , ED HARDY  \u00ae  , TRUTH OR DARE  \u00ae  , MODERN AMUSEMENT  \u00ae  , BUFFALO  \u00ae  , HYDRAULIC  \u00ae  AND PONY  \u00ae.  THE COMPANY PRINCIPALLY LOOKS TO MONETIZE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (HEREIN REFERRED TO AS \u201cIP\u201d) RELATED TO ITS BRANDS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND IN ALL RELEVANT CATEGORIES BY LICENSING DIRECTLY WITH LEADING RETAILERS (HEREIN REFERRED TO AS \u201cDIRECT TO RETAIL\u201d OR \u201cDTR\u201d), THROUGH A CONSORTIA OF WHOLESALE LICENSEES, THROUGH JOINT VENTURES IN SPECIFIC TERRITORIES AND VIA OTHER ACTIVITY SUCH AS CORPORATE SPONSORSHIPS AND CONTENT AS WELL AS THE SALE OF IP FOR SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OR TERRITORIES. PRODUCTS BEARING THE COMPANY\u2019S BRANDS ARE SOLD ACROSS A VARIETY OF DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE LICENSEES ARE GENERALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTING THE LICENSED PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY SUPPORTS ITS BRANDS WITH MARKETING, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS DESIGNED TO INCREASE BRAND AWARENESS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY PROVIDES ITS LICENSEES WITH COORDINATED TREND DIRECTION TO ENHANCE PRODUCT APPEAL AND HELP BUILD AND MAINTAIN BRAND INTEGRITY.  GLOBALLY, THE COMPANY HAS OVER 50 DTR LICENSES AND MORE THAN 400 TOTAL LICENSES.  LICENSEES ARE SELECTED BASED UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S BELIEF THAT SUCH LICENSEES WILL BE ABLE TO PRODUCE AND SELL QUALITY PRODUCTS IN THE CATEGORIES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS OF THEIR SPECIFIC EXPERTISE AND THAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF EXCEEDING MINIMUM SALES TARGETS AND ROYALTIES THAT THE COMPANY GENERALLY REQUIRES FOR EACH BRAND. THIS LICENSING STRATEGY IS DESIGNED TO PERMIT THE COMPANY TO OPERATE ITS LICENSING BUSINESS, LEVERAGE ITS CORE COMPETENCIES OF MARKETING AND BRAND MANAGEMENT WITH MINIMAL WORKING CAPITAL, AND GENERALLY WITHOUT INVENTORY, PRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION COSTS OR RISKS, AND MAINTAIN HIGH MARGINS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LICENSING AGREEMENTS INCLUDE MINIMUM GUARANTEED ROYALTY REVENUE WHICH PROVIDES THE COMPANY WITH GREATER VISIBILITY INTO FUTURE CASH FLOWS.  AS OF APRIL 1, 2019, THE COMPANY AND ITS JOINT VENTURES HAD A CONTRACTUAL RIGHT TO RECEIVE OVER $395 MILLION OF MINIMUM LICENSING REVENUE OVER THE BALANCE AND THE TERMS OF THEIR CURRENT LICENSES, EXCLUDING ANY RENEWALS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S OP DTR LICENSE AGREEMENT AT WALMART WAS NOT RENEWED UPON EXPIRATION IN JUNE 2017. THE COMPANY\u2019S STARTER DTR LICENSE AGREEMENT AT WALMART WAS NOT RENEWED UPON EXPIRATION IN DECEMBER 2017. IN OCTOBER 2017, THE COMPANY ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT STARTER IS NOW AVAILABLE ON AMAZON EXCLUSIVELY TO AMAZON PRIME MEMBERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE DANSKIN NOW LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH WALMART WAS NOT RENEWED UPON ITS EXPIRATION IN JANUARY 2019. THE COMPANY\u2019S MOSSIMO DTR LICENSE AGREEMENT AT TARGET WAS NOT RENEWED UPON EXPIRATION IN OCTOBER 2018. THE COMPANY\u2019S MATERIAL GIRL LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH MACY\u2019S WILL NOT BE RENEWED UPON ITS EXPIRATION IN JANUARY 2020. THE COMPANY\u2018S ROYAL VELVET LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH JC PENNEY WAS NOT RENEWED UPON ITS EXPIRATION IN JANUARY 2019. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY SEEKING TO PLACE OP, DANSKIN, MOSSIMO, MATERIAL GIRL AND ROYAL VELVET WITH NEW OR EXISTING LICENSEES. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY IS UNCERTAIN HOW THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY POTENTIAL REPLACEMENT LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS COULD AFFECT ITS FUTURE REVENUES AND CASH FLOWS.  A KEY INITIATIVE IN THE COMPANY\u2019S GLOBAL BRAND EXPANSION PLANS HAS BEEN THE FORMATION OF INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES. THE STRATEGY IN FORMING INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES IS TO PARTNER WITH BEST-IN-CLASS, LOCAL PARTNERS TO BRING THE COMPANY\u2019S BRANDS TO MARKET MORE QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY, GENERATING GREATER SHORT- AND LONG-TERM VALUE FROM ITS IP, THAN THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS POSSIBLE IF IT WERE TO BUILD-OUT WHOLLY-OWNED OPERATIONS OURSELVES ACROSS A MULTITUDE OF REGIONAL OR LOCAL OFFICES. SINCE SEPTEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED THE FOLLOWING INTERNATIONAL JOINT VENTURES: ICONIX CHINA, ICONIX LATIN AMERICA, ICONIX EUROPE, ICONIX INDIA, ICONIX CANADA, ICONIX AUSTRALIA, ICONIX SOUTHEAST ASIA, ICONIX ISRAEL, ICONIX MIDDLE EAST, UMBRO CHINA, DANSKIN CHINA, STARTER CHINA AND LEE COOPER CHINA.  THE COMPANY\u2019S PRIMARY GOAL OF MAXIMIZING THE VALUE OF ITS IP ALSO INCLUDES, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE SALE TO THIRD PARTIES OF A BRAND\u2019S TRADEMARK IN SPECIFIC TERRITORIES OR CATEGORIES.  AS SUCH, THE COMPANY EVALUATES POTENTIAL OFFERS TO ACQUIRE SOME OR ALL OF A BRAND\u2019S IP BY COMPARING WHETHER THE OFFER IS MORE VALUABLE THAN THE COMPANY\u2019S ESTIMATE OF THE CURRENT AND POTENTIAL REVENUE STREAMS TO BE EARNED VIA THE COMPANY\u2019S TRADITIONAL LICENSING MODEL.  FURTHER, AS PART OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EVALUATION PROCESS, IT ALSO CONSIDERS WHETHER OR NOT THE BUYER\u2019S FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAND MAY HELP TO EXPAND THE BRAND\u2019S OVERALL RECOGNITION AND GLOBAL REVENUE POTENTIAL.  THE COMPANY IDENTIFIES ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS ACCORDING TO HOW BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ARE MANAGED AND EVALUATED AND, FOR WHICH SEPARATE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AND UTILIZED ON A REGULAR BASIS BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER IN DECIDING HOW TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES AND IN ASSESSING PERFORMANCE.  34  THEREFORE, THE COMPANY HAS DISCLOSED THESE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS FOR THE PERIODS SHOWN BELOW.

OUR NET INCOME WAS APPROXIMATELY $21.3 MILLION IN THE CURRENT QUARTER, COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $30.6 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, AS A RESULT OF THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  LIQUIDITY  OUR PRINCIPAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE TO REFINANCE OR EXTINGUISH EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS AND TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS.

OVERVIEW  OUR COMPANY AND OUR BUSINESSES  STARTING WITH A FOCUS ON PC GRAPHICS, NVIDIA INVENTED THE GPU TO SOLVE SOME OF THE MOST COMPLEX PROBLEMS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE. WE HAVE EXTENDED OUR FOCUS IN RECENT YEARS TO THE REVOLUTIONARY FIELD OF AI. FUELED BY THE SUSTAINED DEMAND FOR BETTER 3D GRAPHICS AND THE SCALE OF THE GAMING MARKET, NVIDIA HAS EVOLVED THE GPU INTO A COMPUTER BRAIN AT THE INTERSECTION OF VIRTUAL REALITY, HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING, OR HPC, AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, OR AI.  OUR TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS - GPU AND TEGRA PROCESSOR - ARE BASED ON A SINGLE UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE. FROM OUR PROPRIETARY PROCESSORS, WE HAVE CREATED PLATFORMS THAT ADDRESS FOUR LARGE MARKETS WHERE OUR EXPERTISE IS CRITICAL: GAMING, PROFESSIONAL VISUALIZATION, DATA CENTER, AND AUTOMOTIVE.  OUR GPU PRODUCT BRANDS ARE AIMED AT SPECIALIZED MARKETS INCLUDING GEFORCE FOR GAMERS; QUADRO FOR DESIGNERS; TESLA AND DGX FOR AI DATA SCIENTISTS AND BIG DATA RESEARCHERS; AND GRID FOR CLOUD-BASED VISUAL COMPUTING USERS. OUR TEGRA BRAND INTEGRATES AN ENTIRE COMPUTER ONTO A SINGLE CHIP, AND INCORPORATES GPUS AND MULTI-CORE CPUS TO DRIVE SUPERCOMPUTING FOR AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS, DRONES, AND CARS, AS WELL AS FOR CONSOLES AND MOBILE GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES.  HEADQUARTERED IN SANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA, NVIDIA WAS INCORPORATED IN CALIFORNIA IN APRIL 1993 AND REINCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN APRIL 1998.  23  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, FUTURE OBJECTIVES AND CHALLENGES  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR  2020  SUMMARY  THREE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 28, 2019  JANUARY 27, 2019  APRIL 29, 2018  QUARTER-OVER-QUARTER CHANGE  YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE  ($ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)  REVENUE  $2,220  $2,205  $3,207  1%  (31  )%  GROSS MARGIN  58.4%  54.7%  64.5%  370 BPS  (610) BPS  OPERATING EXPENSES  $938  $913  $773  3%  21%  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS  $358  $294  $1,295  22%  (72  )%  NET INCOME  $394  $567  $1,244  (31  )%  (68  )%  NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE  $0.64  $0.92  $1.98  (30  )%  (68  )%  REVENUE FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2020  DECREASED  31%  YEAR OVER YEAR AND INCREASED  1%  SEQUENTIALLY.  GPU BUSINESS REVENUE WAS  $2.02 BILLION  , DOWN 27% FROM A YEAR EARLIER AND UP 2% SEQUENTIALLY. THE YEAR-ON-YEAR DECREASE REFLECTS DECLINES IN GAMING AND DATA CENTER REVENUE, AS WELL AS THE ABSENCE OF $289 MILLION  OF OEM REVENUE FROM CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING PROCESSORS, OR CMP.  TEGRA PROCESSOR BUSINESS REVENUE - WHICH INCLUDES AUTOMOTIVE, SOC MODULES FOR GAMING PLATFORMS, AND EMBEDDED EDGE AI PLATFORMS - WAS  $198 MILLION  , DOWN 55% FROM A YEAR AGO AND DOWN 12% SEQUENTIALLY. THE YEAR-ON-YEAR DECREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTS A DECLINE IN SHIPMENTS OF SOC MODULES FOR GAMING PLATFORMS.  GAMING REVENUE WAS $1.05 BILLION, DOWN 39% FROM A YEAR AGO AND UP 11% SEQUENTIALLY. THE YEAR-ON-YEAR DECREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTS A DECLINE IN SHIPMENTS OF GAMING GPUS AND SOC MODULES FOR GAMING PLATFORMS. THE SEQUENTIAL INCREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTS GROWTH IN GAMING GPUS. WE BELIEVE A SHORTAGE OF INTEL PROCESSORS THAT IS IMPACTING THE GLOBAL PC MARKET WILL AFFECT OUR SALES OF GAMING GPUS FOR LAPTOPS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020.

THE YEAR-ON-YEAR INCREASE REFLECTS STRENGTH ACROSS BOTH DESKTOP AND MOBILE WORKSTATION PRODUCTS. THE SEQUENTIAL DECREASE LARGELY REFLECTS A SEASONAL DECLINE.  DATA CENTER REVENUE WAS  $634 MILLION  , DOWN 10% FROM A YEAR AGO AND DOWN 7% SEQUENTIALLY, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A SLOWDOWN IN PURCHASES BY CERTAIN HYPERSCALE AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN INFERENCE SALES. WE BELIEVE THIS SLOWDOWN IN PURCHASES WILL LIKELY PERSIST INTO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020.  AUTOMOTIVE REVENUE OF  $166 MILLION  WAS UP 14% FROM A YEAR EARLIER AND UP 2% SEQUENTIALLY, PRIMARILY REFLECTING GROWTH IN AI COCKPIT MODULES.  OEM AND OTHER REVENUE WAS  $99 MILLION  , DOWN 74% FROM A YEAR AGO AND DOWN 15% SEQUENTIALLY. THE YEAR-ON-YEAR DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF $289 MILLION  FROM CMP SALES.  GROSS MARGIN FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2020  WAS  58.4%  , DOWN 610 BASIS POINTS FROM A YEAR EARLIER AND UP 370 BASIS POINTS SEQUENTIALLY. THE YEAR-ON-YEAR DECREASE REFLECTS LOWER GAMING MARGINS AND MIX SHIFTS ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO. THE SEQUENTIAL INCREASE REFLECTS THE ABSENCE OF APPROXIMATELY $128 MILLION IN CHARGES RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 FOR EXCESS DRAM, BOARDS, AND OTHER COMPONENTS.  OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2020  WERE  $938 MILLION  , UP  21%  FROM A YEAR EARLIER AND UP  3%  SEQUENTIALLY, REFLECTING PRIMARILY EMPLOYEE ADDITIONS AND INCREASES IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND OTHER RELATED COSTS, INCLUDING INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS.

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE  $7.80 BILLION  AS OF  APRIL 28, 2019  , COMPARED WITH $7.42 BILLION AS OF JANUARY 27, 2019. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO OPERATING INCOME AND CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL.  ON MARCH 10, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, OR THE MERGER AGREEMENT, WITH MELLANOX TECHNOLOGIES LTD, OR MELLANOX, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE WILL ACQUIRE ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES OF MELLANOX FOR  $125  PER SHARE IN CASH, REPRESENTING A TOTAL ENTERPRISE VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY  $6.9 BILLION  AS OF THE DATE OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT. THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE APPROVAL BY MELLANOX SHAREHOLDERS AND VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES. IF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVING THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS, WE COULD BE OBLIGATED TO PAY MELLANOX A TERMINATION FEE OF  $350 MILLION.  GPU BUSINESS  DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2020  , WE INTRODUCED THE GEFORCE GTX 1660 TI, GTX 1660 AND GTX 1650 GAMING GPUS WITH IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AND EFFICIENCY FOR TODAY\u2019S MOST POPULAR GAMES; ANNOUNCED A NUMBER OF GAMING LAPTOP MODELS BASED ON TURING GPUS FROM TOP MAKERS; AND ANNOUNCED THAT REAL-TIME RAY TRACING IS NOW INTEGRATED INTO UNREAL ENGINE AND UNITY COMMERCIAL GAME ENGINES.

GROSS MARGIN  OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN DECREASED TO  58.4%  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR  2020  FROM  64.5%  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR  2019  . THE DECREASE IN FISCAL YEAR 2020 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER GAMING MARGINS AND MIX SHIFTS ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO.  INVENTORY PROVISIONS TOTALED $43 MILLION AND $33 MILLION FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEARS  2020  AND  2019  , RESPECTIVELY. SALES OF INVENTORY THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN-OFF OR WRITTEN-DOWN TOTALED $12 MILLION AND $4 MILLION FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEARS  2020  AND  2019  , RESPECTIVELY. AS A RESULT, THE OVERALL NET EFFECT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN WAS AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF 1.4% AND 0.9% FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEARS  2020  AND  2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  A DISCUSSION OF OUR GROSS MARGIN RESULTS FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IS AS FOLLOWS.  GPU BUSINESS.  THE GROSS MARGIN OF OUR GPU BUSINESS DECREASED DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2020  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEAR  2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER GAMING GPU MARGINS AND MIX SHIFTS ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO.  TEGRA PROCESSOR BUSINESS.  THE GROSS MARGIN OF OUR TEGRA PROCESSOR BUSINESS DECREASED DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER OF  FISCAL YEAR  2020  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST QUARTER OF  FISCAL YEAR  2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO MIX SHIFTS.

TOTAL OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST INCOME CONSISTS OF INTEREST EARNED ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES. INTEREST INCOME WAS  $44 MILLION  AND  $25 MILLION  DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  YEARS  2020  AND  2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE INVESTED BALANCES AND HIGHER RATES FROM OUR FLOATING RATE SECURITIES AND THE PURCHASE OF NEW SECURITIES.  INTEREST EXPENSE IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF COUPON INTEREST AND DEBT DISCOUNT AMORTIZATION RELATED TO THE 2.20% NOTES DUE 2021 AND 3.20% NOTES DUE 2026 ISSUED IN SEPTEMBER 2016. INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $13 MILLION  AND  $15 MILLION  DURING THE  FIRST  QUARTERS OF FISCAL YEARS  2020  AND  2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  27  OTHER, NET  OTHER, NET, CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF REALIZED OR UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM NON-AFFILIATED INVESTMENTS, AND THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES.

EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY  MGT  CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, INC. (\u201cMGT\u201d, \u201cTHE COMPANY\u201d, \u201cWE\u201d, OR \u201cUS\u201d) IS A DELAWARE  CORPORATION, INCORPORATED IN 2000. THE COMPANY WAS ORIGINALLY INCORPORATED IN UTAH IN 1977. MGT IS COMPRISED OF THE PARENT COMPANY,  AND ITS WHOLLY\u2013OWNED SUBSIDIARY MGT SWEDEN AB. OUR CORPORATE OFFICE IS LOCATED IN DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA.  ALL  DOLLAR FIGURES SET FORTH IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON THIS FORM 10-Q ARE IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER-SHARE AMOUNTS.  AS  OF MARCH 31, 2019, MGT OWNED AND OR MANAGED APPROXIMATELY 5,700 MINING MACHINES. APPROXIMATELY 2,500 MACHINES ARE  LOCATED IN COLORADO AND 3,200 MACHINES ARE LOCATED IN OHIO. OF THE 5,700 MACHINES, 3,700 ARE OWNED BY THE  COMPANY, AND THE REMAINING MACHINES ARE INVESTOR OWNED. ALL MINERS OWNED OR MANAGED BY MGT ARE S9 ANTMINERS SOLD BY BITMAIN TECHNOLOGIES  LTD. IN ADDITION TO THE S9 ANTMINERS, THE COMPANY OWNS 50 CUSTOM DESIGNED GPU-BASED ETHEREUM MINING RIGS. BECAUSE THE PRICE OF  BITCOIN STEADILY DECREASED DURING 2018 AND THROUGHOUT THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THE COMPANY DECIDED IT WAS NOT ECONOMICALLY RESPONSIBLE  TO COMMENCE MINING OPERATIONS IN COLORADO OR OHIO. ON MAY 14, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED COMMENCEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN  BOTH COLORADO AND OHIO.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cU.S.  GAAP\u201d). THE NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT DESCRIBE  OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE  PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS  OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE  OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES.  WE  BELIEVE THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES LISTED BELOW REFLECT SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE PREPARATION  OF OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  21  REVENUE  RECOGNITION  THE  COMPANY\u2019S PRIMARY REVENUE STREAM IS RELATED TO THE MINING OF DIGITAL CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY DERIVES ITS REVENUE BY SOLVING  \u201cBLOCKS\u201d TO BE ADDED TO THE BLOCKCHAIN AND PROVIDING TRANSACTION VERIFICATION SERVICES WITHIN THE DIGITAL CURRENCY  NETWORKS OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES, SUCH AS BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM, COMMONLY TERMED \u201cCRYPTOCURRENCY MINING.\u201d IN CONSIDERATION  FOR THESE SERVICES, THE COMPANY RECEIVES DIGITAL CURRENCY (\u201cCOINS\u201d). THE COINS ARE RECORDED AS REVENUE, USING THE  AVERAGE SPOT PRICE OF BITCOIN ON THE DATE OF RECEIPT. THE COINS ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS AN INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSET  VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. NET REALIZABLE VALUE ADJUSTMENTS, TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF THE COINS TO THEIR  MARKET VALUE, IS INCLUDED IN COST OF REVENUE ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATION. ANY GAIN OR LOSS ON  SALE WOULD BE RECORDED TO COST OF REVENUES. COSTS OF REVENUES INCLUDES EQUIPMENT DEPRECIATION, RENT, NET REALIZABLE VALUE ADJUSTMENTS,  AND ELECTRICITY COSTS.  THE  COMPANY ALSO RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM ITS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY RECEIVES A FEE FROM EACH MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT BASED  ON THE AMOUNT OF BITCOIN MINED AND IS REIMBURSED FOR ANY ELECTRICITY COSTS INCURRED TO RUN THE BITCOIN MINING MACHINES IT MANAGES  IN ITS FACILITY.  STOCK\u2013BASED  COMPENSATION  THE  COMPANY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ALL EQUITY\u2013BASED PAYMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION  (\u201cASC\u201d) 718 \u201cCOMPENSATION \u2013 STOCK COMPENSATION\u201d. UNDER FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS, THE COMPANY  RECOGNIZES EQUITY\u2013BASED COMPENSATION NET OF AN ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE AND RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION COST ONLY FOR THOSE  SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD.  RESTRICTED  STOCK AWARDS ARE GRANTED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY. THESE AWARDS  ARE RESTRICTED AS TO THE TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP AND GENERALLY VEST OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIODS, TYPICALLY OVER A 12 TO 24  MONTH PERIOD (VESTING ON A STRAIGHT\u2013LINE BASIS). THE FAIR VALUE OF A STOCK AWARD IS EQUAL TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF A  SHARE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK ON THE GRANT DATE.  THE  FAIR VALUE OF AN OPTION AWARD IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE BLACK\u2013SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL. THE BLACK\u2013SCHOLES  OPTION VALUATION MODEL REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE INPUTS INTO THE MODEL. THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE THE EXPECTED  STOCK VOLATILITY, THE RISK\u2013FREE INTEREST RATE, THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE OPTION, THE DIVIDEND YIELD ON THE UNDERLYING STOCK  AND THE EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE. EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S  COMMON STOCK OVER THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE OPTION. RISK\u2013FREE INTEREST RATES ARE CALCULATED BASED ON CONTINUOUSLY COMPOUNDED  RISK\u2013FREE RATES FOR THE APPROPRIATE TERM.  DETERMINING  THE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUE MODEL AND CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY\u2013BASED PAYMENT AWARDS REQUIRES THE INPUT OF THE  SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY\u2013BASED PAYMENT AWARDS  REPRESENT MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST ESTIMATES, WHICH INVOLVE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT.  THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE AND RECOGNIZE EXPENSE ONLY FOR THOSE SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST.  THE  COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR SHARE\u2013BASED PAYMENTS GRANTED TO NON\u2013EMPLOYEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 505\u201350, \u201cEQUITY  BASED PAYMENTS TO NON\u2013EMPLOYEES\u201d. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE FAIR VALUE OF THE STOCK\u2013BASED PAYMENT AS EITHER  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED OR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS ISSUED, WHICHEVER IS MORE READILY DETERMINABLE.  IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS ISSUED IS USED, IT IS MEASURED USING THE STOCK PRICE AND OTHER MEASUREMENT ASSUMPTIONS  AS OF THE EARLIER OF EITHER (1) THE DATE AT WHICH A COMMITMENT FOR PERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTY TO EARN THE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS  IS REACHED, OR (2) THE DATE AT WHICH THE COUNTERPARTY\u2019S PERFORMANCE IS COMPLETE. THE FAIR VALUE OF UNVESTED EQUITY INSTRUMENTS  IS RE\u2013MEASURED EACH REPORTING PERIOD AND SUCH RE-MEASURED VALUE IS AMORTIZED OVER THE REQUISITE REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD.  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  THREE  MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018  REVENUES  OUR  REVENUES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 DECREASED BY $928, OR 97%, TO $28 AS COMPARED TO $956 FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. OUR REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING. THE DECREASE IN REVENUES IS A RESULT OF OUR DECISION  TO NOT OPERATE THE MAJORITY OF OUR MINERS DUE TO THE UNFAVORABLE ECONOMICS OF DECREASED PRICE OF BITCOIN AND INCREASED DIFFICULTY.  22  OPERATING  EXPENSES  OPERATING  EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 DECREASED BY $3,192, OR 61%, TO $2,000 AS COMPARED TO $5,192 FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES, AS WELL AS NO COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MARKETING OR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND A DECREASE OF $795 IN COST OF SALES FROM  CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING OPERATIONS.  THE  DECREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF $2,295, OR 55% TO $1,914 AS COMPARED TO $4,209 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION OF $1,273 AND A DECREASE IN PAYROLL AND  RELATED EXPENSES OF $426, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LEGAL AND PROFESSIONAL FEES OF $57.  OTHER  INCOME AND EXPENSE  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, NON\u2013OPERATING EXPENSES CONSISTED OF INTEREST EXPENSE OF $3, ACCRETION OF DEBT DISCOUNT  OF $1,091, GAIN ON SALE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT OF $82 AND A GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF $1,275. DURING  THE COMPARABLE PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, NON\u2013OPERATING EXPENSES CONSISTED OF A WARRANT MODIFICATION EXPENSE OF $139,  LOSS ON SALE OF BUSINESS UNIT OF $127, AND A LOSS ON SALE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT OF $47.  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  SOURCES  OF LIQUIDITY  WE  HAVE HISTORICALLY FINANCED OUR BUSINESS THROUGH THE SALE OF DEBT AND EQUITY INTERESTS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAVE INCURRED  SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES SINCE INCEPTION AND CONTINUE TO GENERATE LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS AND AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 HAVE AN  ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $406,425. AT MARCH 31, 2019, OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE $362 AND OUR WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT  WAS $526. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD NOTES PAYABLE OUTSTANDING WITH A FACE VALUE OF $3,659.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S  PLANS INCLUDE OVERSEEING THE OPERATION OF APPROXIMATELY 5,700 CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING MACHINES IN COLORADO AND OHIO AND CONTINUING  TO EXECUTE ON AN EXPANSION MODEL TO SECURE LOW COST POWER AND GROW ITS CRYPTOCURRENCY ASSETS. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE  UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY DECIDED NOT TO COMMENCE THE MAJORITY OF ITS MINING  OPERATIONS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AS IT BELIEVED THAT IT WAS NOT ECONOMICALLY RESPONSIBLE TO DO SO BASED ON UNFAVORABLE  BITCOIN ECONOMICS. THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN HISTORICAL RESULTS, AS  IT HAD ONLY 500 MACHINES IN OPERATION. BASED ON CURRENT BUDGET ASSUMPTIONS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO MEET  ITS OPERATING EXPENSES AND OBLIGATIONS FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE THESE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ISSUED.  THE COMPANY WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO GROW ITS OPERATIONS AND TO PAY CURRENT MATURITIES OF DEBT. THERE CAN BE NO  ASSURANCE HOWEVER THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL WHEN NEEDED, OR AT TERMS DEEMED ACCEPTABLE, IF AT  ALL. SUCH FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR FROM THE  ISSUANCE OF THESE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLANS, INCLUDING THE OPERATION OF  ITS EXISTING CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING MACHINES, THE RAISING OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND POTENTIALLY CURTAILING ITS OPERATIONS ALLEVIATE  SUCH SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT. THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS  RELATED TO THE RECOVERABILITY AND CLASSIFICATION OF ASSET AMOUNTS OR THE CLASSIFICATION OF LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY  SHOULD THE COMPANY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  THE  PRICE OF BITCOIN IS VOLATILE, AND FLUCTUATIONS ARE EXPECTED. DECLINES IN THE PRICE OF BITCOIN HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT IN OUR OPERATING  RESULTS AND LIQUIDITY AND COULD HARM THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. MOVEMENTS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING,  BUT NOT LIMITED TO, GOVERNMENT REGULATION, SECURITY BREACHES EXPERIENCED BY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AS WELL AS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC  UNCERTAINTIES AROUND THE WORLD. SINCE WE RECORD REVENUE BASED ON THE PRICE OF EARNED BITCOIN AND WE MAY RETAIN SUCH BITCOIN AS  AN ASSET OR AS PAYMENT FOR FUTURE EXPENSES, THE RELATIVE VALUE OF SUCH REVENUES MAY FLUCTUATE, AS WILL THE VALUE OF ANY BITCOIN  WE RETAIN. THE HIGH AND LOW EXCHANGE RATE PER BITCOIN FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, AS REPORTED BY BLOCKCHAIN.INFO,  WERE APPROXIMATELY $3 AND $5 RESPECTIVELY.  THE  COMPANY\u2019S PRIMARY SOURCE OF OPERATING FUNDS HAS BEEN THROUGH DEBT AND EQUITY FINANCING. ON AUGUST 30, 2018, THE COMPANY  AND OASIS CAPITAL, LLC (FORMERLY KNOWN AS L2 CAPITAL, LLC) (\u201cOASIS CAPITAL\u201d), A KANSAS LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY,  ENTERED INTO AN EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cEQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE  AND SELL TO OASIS CAPITAL FROM TIME TO TIME UP TO $35,000 OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK THAT IS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC  UNDER A REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON A FORM S\u20133. THE AMOUNT OF THE EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT WAS AMENDED TO $50,000 ON DECEMBER  3, 2018. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY ISSUED 33,650,000 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN EXCHANGE FOR $2,459.  DURING THE PERIOD JANUARY 1, 2019 THROUGH APRIL 15, 2019, THE COMPANY ISSUED 58,600,000 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN EXCHANGE  FOR $3,277. ON APRIL 16, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S\u20133 LOST ITS EFFECTIVENESS AS THE AGGREGATE  MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK HELD BY NON-AFFILIATES WAS BELOW THE REGULATORY THRESHOLD OF $75,000. THEREFORE  THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE ITS EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT AS A SOURCE OF OPERATING FUNDS.  SALE  OF PREFERRED STOCK  ON  APRIL 12, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE AUTHORIZATION OF 200 SHARES OF SERIES C CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED  STOCK WITH A PAR VALUE OF $0.001 AND A STATED VALUE OF $10,000 PER SHARE (\u201cPREFERRED SHARES\u201d). THE HOLDERS OF THE  PREFERRED SHARES ARE NOT ENTITLED TO VOTE THEIR SHARES OR RECEIVE DIVIDENDS. AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO THE ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY FROM  THE ISSUANCE DATE, THE COMPANY MAY REDEEM THE PREFERRED SHARES AT 1.4 TIMES THE STATED VALUE, FOLLOWING WHICH THE COMPANY MAY  REDEEM THE PREFERRED SHARES AT 1.2 TIMES THE STATED VALUE.  EACH  PREFERRED SHARE IS CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF: (A) 200,000  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OR (B) THE AMOUNT DERIVED BY DIVIDING THE STATED VALUE BY THE PRODUCT OF 0.7 TIMES THE MARKET PRICE OF  THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK, DEFINED AS THE LOWEST TRADING PRICE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK DURING THE TEN DAY PERIOD  PRECEDING THE CONVERSION DATE. THE HOLDER MAY NOT CONVERT ANY PREFERRED SHARES IF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SHARES, TOGETHER WITH HOLDINGS  OF ITS AFFILIATES, FOLLOWING A CONVERSION SHALL EXCEED 9.99% OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK. THE COMMON SHARES ISSUED UPON  CONVERSION HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3. ON APRIL 12, 2019, THE COMPANY SOLD  190 PREFERRED SHARES FOR $1,900.  23  SALE  OF COMMON STOCK  ON  APRIL 12, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH AN ACCREDITED INVESTOR WHEREBY IT SOLD 17,500,000 SHARES OF  ITS COMMON STOCK FOR $525 PURSUANT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3. THE HOLDER OF THESE SHARES IS  ALSO THE HOLDER OF THE JUNE 2018 NOTE AND AN AFFILIATE OF THE HOLDER OF 150 SHARES OF THE PREFERRED SHARES.

A LOWER WITHHOLDING  TAX RATE WILL BE APPLIED IF THERE IS A TAX TREATY ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN MAINLAND CHINA AND THE JURISDICTION OF THE FOREIGN HOLDING  COMPANY. HOLDING COMPANIES IN HONG KONG, FOR EXAMPLE, WILL BE SUBJECT TO A 5% RATE, SUBJECT TO APPROVAL FROM THE RELATED PRC TAX  AUTHORITIES.  THE ABILITY  OF OUR PRC SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE DIVIDENDS AND OTHER PAYMENTS TO US MAY ALSO BE RESTRICTED BY CHANGES IN APPLICABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE  AND OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  FOREIGN  CURRENCY EXCHANGE REGULATION IN CHINA IS PRIMARILY GOVERNED BY THE FOLLOWING RULES.  \u2022  FOREIGN EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATION RULES (1996), AS AMENDED IN AUGUST 2008, OR THE EXCHANGE RULES;  \u2022  ADMINISTRATION RULES OF THE SETTLEMENT, SALE AND PAYMENT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE (1996), OR THE ADMINISTRATION  RULES.  CURRENTLY,  UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION RULES, RENMINBI IS FREELY CONVERTIBLE FOR CURRENT ACCOUNT ITEMS, INCLUDING THE DISTRIBUTION OF DIVIDENDS,  INTEREST PAYMENTS, TRADE AND SERVICE RELATED FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS, BUT NOT FOR CAPITAL ACCOUNT ITEMS, SUCH AS DIRECT INVESTMENTS,  LOANS, REPATRIATION OF INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES OUTSIDE OF CHINA, UNLESS THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE STATE ADMINISTRATION  OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE (THE \u201cSAFE\u201d) IS OBTAINED AND PRIOR REGISTRATION WITH THE SAFE IS MADE. FOREIGN-INVESTED ENTERPRISES  LIKE RISE KING WFOE THAT NEED FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF PROFITS TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS MAY EFFECT PAYMENT FROM THEIR  FOREIGN EXCHANGE ACCOUNTS OR PURCHASE AND PAY FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AT THE DESIGNATED FOREIGN EXCHANGE BANKS TO THEIR FOREIGN  SHAREHOLDERS BY PRODUCING BOARD RESOLUTIONS FOR SUCH PROFIT DISTRIBUTION. BASED ON THEIR NEEDS, FOREIGN-INVESTED ENTERPRISES ARE  PERMITTED TO OPEN FOREIGN EXCHANGE SETTLEMENT ACCOUNTS FOR CURRENT ACCOUNT RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE ALONG WITH  SPECIALIZED ACCOUNTS FOR CAPITAL ACCOUNT RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE AT CERTAIN DESIGNATED FOREIGN EXCHANGE BANKS.  35  ALTHOUGH  THE CURRENT EXCHANGE RULES ALLOW THE CONVERTIBILITY OF RENMINBI INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FOR CURRENT ACCOUNT ITEMS, CONVERSION OF  RENMINBI INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR CAPITAL ITEMS, SUCH AS FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT, LOANS OR SECURITIES, REQUIRES THE APPROVAL  OF SAFE, WHICH IS UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE PEOPLE\u2019S BANK OF CHINA. THESE APPROVALS, HOWEVER, DO NOT GUARANTEE THE AVAILABILITY  OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION. WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ALL REQUIRED CONVERSION APPROVALS FOR OUR OPERATIONS  OR THE CHINESE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES WILL NOT IMPOSE GREATER RESTRICTIONS ON THE CONVERTIBILITY OF RENMINBI IN THE FUTURE. CURRENTLY,  MOST OF OUR RETAINED EARNINGS ARE GENERATED IN RENMINBI. ANY FUTURE RESTRICTIONS ON CURRENCY EXCHANGES MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO  USE RETAINED EARNINGS GENERATED IN RENMINBI TO MAKE DIVIDENDS OR OTHER PAYMENTS IN U.S. DOLLARS OR FUND POSSIBLE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES  OUTSIDE CHINA.

ON MAY 13, 2010, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF \u20ac75.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES TO ACCREDITED INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS. THE \u20ac75.0 MILLION OF SENIOR NOTES CONSISTED OF \u20ac30.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.71% SERIES 2010-A SENIOR NOTES, WHICH WERE REPAID DURING FISCAL 2017, AND \u20ac45.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 4.24% SERIES 2010-A SENIOR NOTES, DUE MAY 13, 2020, WITH INTEREST PAYABLE ON THE NOTES SEMIANNUALLY.

THE NOTES HAVE BEEN FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED ON AN UNSECURED BASIS BY THE COMPANY\u2019S DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES.  ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2015, THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO AN UNSECURED $300 MILLION MULTI-CURRENCY REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT WITH A GROUP OF SIX BANKS. AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, THE AVAILABLE AMOUNT UNDER THE REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT MAY BE INCREASED FROM $300 MILLION TO $450 MILLION. AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  , THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING ON THE CREDIT FACILITY, AND THE MAXIMUM OUTSTANDING BALANCE DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , WAS $3.4 MILLION. THE COMPANY ALSO HAD LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT OF $3.3 MILLION AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  , AND THERE WAS $296.7 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE BORROWING, WHICH CAN BE INCREASED TO $446.7 MILLION AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS. THE REVOLVING LOAN AGREEMENT HAS A FINAL MATURITY DATE OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2020. AS SUCH, THE BORROWING IS INCLUDED IN \"LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS\" ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S DEBT AGREEMENTS REQUIRE IT TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING A RATIO OF DEBT TO THE TRAILING 12 MONTHS EBITDA, AS DEFINED IN THE DEBT AGREEMENTS, OF NOT MORE THAN A 3.25 TO 1.0 RATIO (LEVERAGE RATIO) AND THE TRAILING 12 MONTHS EBITDA TO INTEREST EXPENSE OF NOT LESS THAN A 3.0 TO 1.0 RATIO (INTEREST EXPENSE COVERAGE).

AT  APRIL 30, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY 54% OF THE COMPANY'S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE HELD OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY'S GROWTH HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN FUNDED BY A COMBINATION OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND DEBT FINANCING. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND ITS BORROWING CAPACITY ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND ITS ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, SCHEDULED DEBT REPAYMENTS, AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING PROVIDER OF ONLINE AUCTIONS AND VEHICLE REMARKETING SERVICES WITH OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S.), CANADA, THE UNITED KINGDOM (U.K.), BRAZIL, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, GERMANY, FINLAND, THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (U.A.E.), OMAN, BAHRAIN, AND SPAIN.  OUR GOALS ARE TO GENERATE SUSTAINABLE PROFITS FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS, WHILE ALSO PRODUCING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS FOR THE WORLD, BY PROMOTING VEHICLE RESTORATION, REPAIR, AND RECYCLING; PARTS REFURBISHMENT AND RE-USE; AND FACILITATING THE RECOVERY AND RESILIENCE OF COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY SEVERE CLIMATE EVENTS AND OTHER DISASTERS.  WE PROVIDE VEHICLE SELLERS WITH A FULL RANGE OF SERVICES TO PROCESS AND SELL VEHICLES PRIMARILY OVER THE INTERNET THROUGH OUR VIRTUAL BIDDING THIRD GENERATION INTERNET AUCTION-STYLE SALES TECHNOLOGY, WHICH WE REFER TO AS VB3. VEHICLE SELLERS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF INSURANCE COMPANIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDE BANKS, FINANCE COMPANIES, CHARITIES, FLEET OPERATORS, DEALERS AND VEHICLES SOURCED DIRECTLY FROM INDIVIDUAL OWNERS. WE SELL THE VEHICLES PRINCIPALLY TO LICENSED VEHICLE DISMANTLERS, REBUILDERS, REPAIR LICENSEES, USED VEHICLE DEALERS AND EXPORTERS AND, AT CERTAIN LOCATIONS, TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE MAJORITY OF THE VEHICLES SOLD ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE EITHER DAMAGED VEHICLES DEEMED A TOTAL LOSS OR NOT ECONOMICALLY REPAIRABLE BY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES, OR ARE RECOVERED STOLEN VEHICLES FOR WHICH AN INSURANCE SETTLEMENT WITH THE VEHICLE OWNER HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE. WE OFFER VEHICLE SELLERS A FULL RANGE OF SERVICES THAT HELP EXPEDITE EACH STAGE OF THE VEHICLE SALES PROCESS, MINIMIZE ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROCESSING COSTS, AND MAXIMIZE THE ULTIMATE SALES PRICE THROUGH THE ONLINE AUCTION PROCESS.  IN THE U.S., CANADA, BRAZIL, THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND, FINLAND, THE U.A.E., OMAN, BAHRAIN, AND SPAIN, WE SELL VEHICLES PRIMARILY AS AN AGENT AND DERIVE REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM AUCTION AND AUCTION RELATED SALES TRANSACTION FEES CHARGED FOR VEHICLE REMARKETING SERVICES AS WELL AS FEES FOR SERVICES SUBSEQUENT TO THE AUCTION, SUCH AS DELIVERY AND STORAGE. IN THE U.K. AND GERMANY, WE OPERATE BOTH AS AN AGENT AND ON A PRINCIPAL BASIS, IN SOME CASES PURCHASING SALVAGE VEHICLES OUTRIGHT AND RESELLING THE VEHICLES FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT. IN GERMANY AND SPAIN, WE ALSO DERIVE REVENUE FROM LISTING VEHICLES ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE EXPERTS TO DETERMINE THE VEHICLE\u2019S RESIDUAL VALUE AND/OR TO FACILITATE A SALE FOR THE INSURED.  WE MONITOR AND ANALYZE A NUMBER OF KEY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS AND EVALUATE OUR FINANCIAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE. SUCH INDICATORS INCLUDE.  SERVICE AND VEHICLE SALES REVENUE.  OUR SERVICE REVENUE CONSISTS OF AUCTION AND AUCTION RELATED SALES TRANSACTION FEES CHARGED FOR VEHICLE REMARKETING SERVICES. THESE AUCTION AND AUCTION RELATED SERVICES MAY INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF VEHICLE PURCHASING FEES, VEHICLE LISTING FEES, AND VEHICLE SELLING FEES THAT CAN BE BASED ON A PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF THE VEHICLE SALES PRICE, TIERED VEHICLE SALES PRICE DRIVEN FEES, OR AT A FIXED FEE BASED ON THE SALE OF EACH VEHICLE REGARDLESS OF THE SELLING PRICE OF THE VEHICLE; TRANSPORTATION FEES FOR THE COST OF TRANSPORTING THE VEHICLE TO OR FROM OUR FACILITY; TITLE PROCESSING AND PREPARATION FEES; VEHICLE STORAGE FEES; BIDDING FEES; AND VEHICLE LOADING FEES. THESE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED AS NET REVENUE (NOT GROSS VEHICLE SELLING PRICE) AT THE TIME OF AUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF SUCH FEES CHARGED. PURCHASED VEHICLE REVENUE INCLUDES THE GROSS SALES PRICE OF THE VEHICLES WHICH WE HAVE PURCHASED OR ARE OTHERWISE CONSIDERED TO OWN. WE HAVE CERTAIN CONTRACTS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES, PRIMARILY IN THE U.K., IN WHICH WE ACT AS A PRINCIPAL, PURCHASING VEHICLES AND RESELLING THEM FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT. WE ALSO PURCHASE VEHICLES IN THE OPEN MARKET, PRIMARILY FROM INDIVIDUALS, AND RESELL THEM FOR OUR OWN ACCOUNT.  23  OUR REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY AND THE AVERAGE VEHICLE AUCTION SELLING PRICE, AS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SERVICE REVENUE IS ASSOCIATED IN SOME MANNER WITH THE ULTIMATE SELLING PRICE OF THE VEHICLE. VEHICLE AUCTION SELLING PRICES ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY: (I) CHANGES IN COMMODITY PRICES, PARTICULARLY THE PER TON PRICE FOR CRUSHED CAR BODIES, AS WE BELIEVE THIS HAS AN IMPACT ON THE ULTIMATE SELLING PRICE OF VEHICLES SOLD FOR SCRAP AND VEHICLES SOLD FOR DISMANTLING; (II) USED CAR PRICING, WHICH WE ALSO BELIEVE HAS AN IMPACT ON TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY; (III) THE MIX OF CARS SOLD; AND (IV) CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE HAS AN IMPACT ON AUCTION PARTICIPATION BY INTERNATIONAL BUYERS. WE CANNOT SPECIFICALLY QUANTIFY THE FINANCIAL IMPACT THAT COMMODITY PRICING, USED CAR PRICING, AND PRODUCT SALES MIX HAS ON THE SELLING PRICE OF VEHICLES, OUR SERVICE REVENUES OR FINANCIAL RESULTS. TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY IS THE PERCENTAGE OF CARS INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES SALVAGE RATHER THAN REPAIR AND IS DRIVEN BY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REPAIRS COSTS, USED CAR VALUES, AND AUCTION RETURNS. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN OVERALL GROWTH IN THE SALVAGE MARKET DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY MAY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY THE DECLINE IN USED CAR VALUES RELATIVE TO REPAIR COSTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE GENERALLY TRENDING UPWARD. CONVERSELY, INCREASES IN USED CAR PRICES, SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING THE MOST RECENT RECESSION, MAY DECREASE TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROWTH RATE. USED CAR VALUES ARE DETERMINED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING USED CAR SUPPLY, WHICH IS TIED DIRECTLY TO NEW CAR SALES, AND THE AVERAGE AGE OF CARS ON THE ROAD. THE AVERAGE AGE OF CARS ON THE ROAD CONTINUED TO INCREASE, GROWING FROM 9.6 YEARS IN 2002 TO 12.1 YEARS IN 2018. THE FACTORS THAT CAN INFLUENCE REPAIR COSTS, USED CAR PRICING, AND AUCTION RETURNS ARE MANY AND VARIED AND WE CANNOT PREDICT THEIR MOVEMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE TRENDS IN TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY.  OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES.  YARD OPERATIONS EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF OPERATING PERSONNEL (WHICH INCLUDES YARD MANAGEMENT, CLERICAL AND YARD EMPLOYEES), RENT, CONTRACT VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION, INSURANCE, FUEL, EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR, AND COSTS OF VEHICLES SOLD UNDER THE PURCHASE CONTRACTS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT, ACCOUNTING, DATA PROCESSING, SALES PERSONNEL, HUMAN RESOURCES, PROFESSIONAL FEES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING EXPENSES.  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.  OTHER INCOME PRIMARILY INCLUDES INCOME FROM THE RENTAL OF CERTAIN REAL PROPERTY, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE GAINS AND LOSSES, AND GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, WHICH WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE NATURE OF THESE ACTIVITIES EACH PERIOD. OTHER EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON LONG-TERM DEBT. SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  3 \u2013 LONG-TERM DEBT.  LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF WORKING CAPITAL IS CASH OPERATING RESULTS AND DEBT FINANCING. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OUR LIQUIDITY IS OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY. THE PRIMARY FACTORS AFFECTING CASH OPERATING RESULTS ARE: (I) SEASONALITY; (II) MARKET WINS AND LOSSES; (III) SUPPLIER MIX; (IV) ACCIDENT FREQUENCY; (V) TOTAL LOSS FREQUENCY; (VI) INCREASED VOLUME FROM OUR EXISTING SUPPLIERS; (VII) COMMODITY PRICING; (VIII) USED CAR PRICING; (IX) FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES; (X) PRODUCT MIX; (XI) CONTRACT MIX TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE; AND (XII) OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THESE FACTORS ARE FURTHER DISCUSSED IN THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND RISK FACTORS SECTIONS OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  POTENTIAL INTERNAL SOURCES OF ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL ARE THE SALE OF ASSETS OR THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES THROUGH OPTION EXERCISES AND SHARES ISSUED UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. A POTENTIAL EXTERNAL SOURCE OF ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL IS THE ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL DEBT WITH NEW LENDERS AND EQUITY. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT PREDICT IF THESE SOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE OR ON COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TERMS.  24  ACQUISITIONS AND NEW OPERATIONS  AS PART OF OUR OVERALL EXPANSION STRATEGY OF OFFERING INTEGRATED SERVICES TO VEHICLE SELLERS, WE ANTICIPATE ACQUIRING AND DEVELOPING FACILITIES IN NEW REGIONS, AS WELL AS THE REGIONS CURRENTLY SERVED BY OUR FACILITIES.

CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSISTED OF BANK DEPOSITS, DOMESTIC CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, AND FUNDS INVESTED IN MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS, WHICH BEAR INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES.  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR GROWTH THROUGH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF COMMON STOCK, EQUITY ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS AND DEBT FINANCING. OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS IS FROM THE COLLECTION OF SERVICE FEES AND REIMBURSABLE ADVANCES FROM THE PROCEEDS OF VEHICLE SALES. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO FINANCE OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND TO DEVELOP AND GROW OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION TO OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE ARE CONSIDERING A VARIETY OF ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL USES FOR OUR REMAINING CASH BALANCES AND OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. THESE ALTERNATIVE POTENTIAL USES INCLUDE ADDITIONAL STOCK REPURCHASES, REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT, THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AND ACQUISITIONS. FOR FURTHER DETAIL, SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  3 \u2013 LONG-TERM DEBT  AND  NOTE  8 \u2013 STOCK REPURCHASES  AND UNDER THE SUBHEADINGS \u201c  CREDIT AGREEMENT  \u201d AND \u201c  NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT  \u201d BELOW.  OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL AS INCLEMENT WEATHER DURING THE WINTER MONTHS INCREASES THE FREQUENCY OF ACCIDENTS AND CONSEQUENTLY, THE NUMBER OF CARS INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS WHICH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES SALVAGE RATHER THAN REPAIR. DURING THE WINTER MONTHS, MOST OF OUR FACILITIES PROCESS 10% TO 30% MORE VEHICLES THAN AT OTHER TIMES OF THE YEAR. THIS INCREASED VOLUME REQUIRES THE INCREASED USE OF OUR CASH TO PAY OUT ADVANCES AND HANDLING COSTS OF THE ADDITIONAL BUSINESS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENTLY AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR OPERATING AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE EXPECT TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS AND EXPAND SOME OF OUR CURRENT FACILITIES IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CASH THROUGH DRAWDOWNS ON OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY OR ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY TO FUND THIS EXPANSION. ALTHOUGH THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF GROWTH THROUGH EXPANSION AND ACQUISITIONS ARE NOT PREDICTABLE, THE OPENING OF NEW GREENFIELD YARDS IS CONTINGENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO LOCATE PROPERTY THAT (I) IS IN AN AREA IN WHICH WE HAVE A NEED FOR MORE CAPACITY; (II) HAS ADEQUATE SIZE GIVEN THE CAPACITY NEEDS; (III) HAS THE APPROPRIATE SHAPE AND TOPOGRAPHY FOR OUR OPERATIONS; (IV) IS REASONABLY CLOSE TO A MAJOR ROAD OR HIGHWAY; AND (V) MOST IMPORTANTLY, HAS THE APPROPRIATE ZONING FOR OUR BUSINESS. COSTS TO DEVELOP A NEW YARD CAN RANGE FROM $3.0 TO $50.0 MILLION, DEPENDING ON SIZE, LOCATION AND DEVELOPMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS.  AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  ,  $72.7 MILLION  OF THE  $102.8 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IF THESE FUNDS ARE NEEDED FOR OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., THE REPATRIATION OF THESE FUNDS COULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX FOLLOWING THE U.S. TAX REFORM. HOWEVER, OUR INTENT IS TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST THESE FUNDS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AND OUR CURRENT PLANS DO NOT REQUIRE REPATRIATION TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONS. SEE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  NOTE  9 \u2013 INCOME TAXES  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING U.S. TAX REFORM AND ITS CORRESPONDING IMPACT ON FOREIGN CASH REPATRIATION.  NET CASH  PROVIDED BY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE TO IMPROVED CASH OPERATING RESULTS FROM AN INCREASE IN SERVICE REVENUES AND VEHICLE SALES AND CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $26.6 MILLION, A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES OF $10.2 MILLION DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS, A DECREASE IN INVENTORY AND VEHICLE POOLING COSTS OF $12.5 MILLION, AND AN INCREASE OF INCOME TAXES RECEIVABLE OF $8.6 MILLION RELATED TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES.  30  NET CASH  USED IN  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND LESS CASH USED FOR ACQUISITIONS. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO LEASE BUYOUTS OF CERTAIN FACILITIES, ACQUIRING LAND, OPENING AND IMPROVING FACILITIES, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR NEW SOFTWARE FOR INTERNAL USE AND MAJOR SOFTWARE ENHANCEMENTS, AND ACQUIRING YARD EQUIPMENT. WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP, EXPAND AND INVEST IN NEW AND EXISTING FACILITIES AND STANDARDIZE THE APPEARANCE OF EXISTING LOCATIONS.  NET CASH  USED IN  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AS PART OF OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND PAYMENTS FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK BASED TAX WITHHOLDINGS, AS DISCUSSED IN FURTHER DETAIL UNDER THE SUBHEADING \"  STOCK REPURCHASES  \" PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET PROCEEDS FROM OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY.

THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT EXTENDED THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD FOR THE TERM LOAN AND DECREASED THE QUARTERLY AMORTIZATION PAYMENTS FOR THAT LOAN TO  $7.5 MILLION  PER QUARTER. THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT ADDITIONALLY REDUCED THE PRICING LEVELS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT TO A RANGE OF  0.15%  TO  0.30%  IN THE CASE OF THE COMMITMENT FEE,  1.125%  TO  2.0%  IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR LIBOR LOANS, AND  0.125%  TO  1.0%  IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR BASE RATE LOANS, BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO DURING THE PRECEDING FISCAL QUARTER. WE BORROWED THE ENTIRE  $93.8 MILLION  PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE INCREMENTAL TERM LOAN CONCURRENT WITH THE CLOSING OF THE AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT.  ON  JULY 21, 2016  , WE ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cSECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, SUNTRUST BANK, AND BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT (AS SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST TO WELLS FARGO BANK).

CONCURRENT WITH THE CLOSING OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT, WE PREPAID IN FULL THE OUTSTANDING  $242.5 MILLION  PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE TERM LOAN AND INCREMENTAL TERM LOAN UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITHOUT PREMIUM OR PENALTY. THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT REDUCED THE PRICING LEVELS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT TO A RANGE OF  0.125%  TO  0.20%  IN THE CASE OF THE COMMITMENT FEE,  1.00%  TO  1.75%  IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR LIBOR LOANS, AND  0.0%  TO  0.75%  IN THE CASE OF THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR BASE RATE LOANS, IN EACH CASE DEPENDING ON OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO DURING THE PRECEDING FISCAL QUARTER. THE PRINCIPAL PURPOSES OF THESE FINANCING TRANSACTIONS WERE TO INCREASE THE SIZE AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM FINANCING. THE PROCEEDS ARE BEING USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, POTENTIAL SHARE REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS, OR OTHER INVESTMENTS RELATING TO OUR EXPANSION STRATEGIES IN DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  31  THE REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT BEARS INTEREST, AT OUR ELECTION, AT EITHER (A) THE BASE RATE, WHICH IS DEFINED AS A FLUCTUATING RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO THE GREATEST OF (I) THE PRIME RATE IN EFFECT ON SUCH DAY; (II) THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN EFFECT ON SUCH DATE PLUS  0.50%  ; OR (III) AN ADJUSTED LIBOR RATE DETERMINED ON THE BASIS OF A ONE-MONTH INTEREST PERIOD PLUS  1.0%  , IN EACH CASE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN RANGING FROM  0.0%  TO  0.75%  BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO DURING THE PRECEDING FISCAL QUARTER; OR (B) AN ADJUSTED LIBOR RATE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN RANGING FROM  1.00%  TO  1.75%  DEPENDING ON OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO DURING THE PRECEDING FISCAL QUARTER.

THE INTEREST RATE AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  ON OUR REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY WAS THE ONE MONTH  LIBOR RATE OF 2.47% PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN OF 1.00%.  THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS COMPRISED OF BORROWINGS UNDER WHICH INTEREST ACCRUES UNDER A FLUCTUATING INTEREST RATE STRUCTURE. ACCORDINGLY, THE CARRYING VALUE APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE AT  APRIL 30, 2019  , AND WAS CLASSIFIED WITHIN LEVEL II OF THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY.  AMOUNTS BORROWED UNDER THE REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY  MAY BE REPAID AND REBORROWED UNTIL THE MATURITY DATE OF  JULY 21, 2021  .

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (\"WE\", \"AGILENT\" OR THE \"COMPANY\"), INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN MAY 1999, IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN LIFE SCIENCES, DIAGNOSTICS AND APPLIED CHEMICAL MARKETS, PROVIDING APPLICATION FOCUSED SOLUTIONS THAT INCLUDE INSTRUMENTS, SOFTWARE, SERVICES AND CONSUMABLES FOR THE ENTIRE LABORATORY WORKFLOW.

NET LOSS FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018  WAS IMPACTED BY A DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF  $533 MILLION  RELATED TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX ACT. SEE NOTE 5, \"INCOME TAXES\" FOR MORE DETAILS. IN THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  , CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WAS  $465 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $518 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018  , CASH DIVIDENDS OF  $104 MILLION  AND  $96 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, WERE PAID ON THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK.  ON NOVEMBER 19, 2018 WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD APPROVED A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM (THE \"2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM\") DESIGNED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE DILUTION RESULTING FROM ISSUANCE OF STOCK UNDER THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. THE 2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZES THE PURCHASE OF UP TO  $1.75 BILLION  OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT THE COMPANY'S DISCRETION AND HAS NO FIXED TERMINATION DATE. THE 2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES AND MAY BE SUSPENDED, AMENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY  638,000  SHARES FOR  $50 MILLION  AND  1.766 MILLION  SHARES FOR  $125 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION. DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE RETIRED APPROXIMATELY  629,000  SHARES FOR  $49 MILLION  AND  1.757 MILLION  SHARES FOR  $124 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE REMAINING  9,000  TREASURY SHARES WERE RETIRED ON MAY 1, 2019. AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE HAD REMAINING AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE UP TO  $1.625 BILLION  OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THIS PROGRAM.  ON MAY 28, 2015, WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD APPROVED A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM (THE \"2015 REPURCHASE PROGRAM\"). THE 2015 REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED THE PURCHASE OF UP TO  $1.14 BILLION  OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT THE COMPANY'S DISCRETION THROUGH AND INCLUDING NOVEMBER 1, 2018.  THE 2015 REPURCHASE PROGRAM DID NOT REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES AND COULD HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.  DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018  , WE REPURCHASED  674,000  SHARES FOR  $46 MILLION  AND  1.3 MILLION  SHARES FOR  $93 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION. DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018  , WE RETIRED APPROXIMATELY  711,000  TREASURY SHARES FOR  $49 MILLION  AND  1.3 MILLION  TREASURY SHARES FOR  $93 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. ON NOVEMBER 1, 2018, THE REMAINING AUTHORIZATION OF  $188 MILLION  UNDER THIS REPURCHASE PROGRAM EXPIRED.  LOOKING FORWARD, DESPITE CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS, WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON DIFFERENTIATING PRODUCT SOLUTIONS, IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMERS' EXPERIENCE AND  GROWING OUR EARNINGS. IN ADDITION, WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON A BALANCED CAPITAL ALLOCATION THROUGH OUR DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. WE EXPECT FOREIGN CURRENCY TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT REVENUE FOR THE REST OF 2019 BUT WE ALSO ANTICIPATE THE CONTRIBUTION FROM OUR SEVERAL ACQUISITIONS IN THE PAST YEAR TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE CURRENCY IMPACT.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) IN THE U.S. THE PREPARATION OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP IN THE U.S. REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE THAT AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MATERIALLY AND INVOLVE DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS BY MANAGEMENT. THOSE POLICIES ARE REVENUE RECOGNITION, INVENTORY VALUATION, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, RETIREMENT AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSUMPTIONS, GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. OTHER THAN ACCOUNTING FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION AND INCOME TAXES AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS DESCRIBED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2018  . MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. ALTHOUGH THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST KNOWLEDGE OF CURRENT EVENTS AND ACTIONS THAT MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY IN THE FUTURE, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE ESTIMATES.  AN ACCOUNTING POLICY IS DEEMED TO BE CRITICAL IF IT REQUIRES AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE TO BE MADE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME THE ESTIMATE IS MADE AND IF DIFFERENT ESTIMATES THAT REASONABLY COULD HAVE BEEN USED OR CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR COULD MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  .    ON NOVEMBER 1, 2018, WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARD CODIFICATION TOPIC 606,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (\"ASC 606\").  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS TO SELL PRODUCTS (HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE), SERVICES AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS (MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS) THAT INCLUDE COMBINATIONS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  WE DERIVE REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF ANALYTICAL AND DIAGNOSTICS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS A PROMISE IN A CONTRACT TO TRANSFER A DISTINCT PRODUCT OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER AND IS THE UNIT OF ACCOUNT UNDER ASC 606. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PROMISED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IS TRANSFERRED TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS FULFILLED IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION THAT WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, THE TRANSACTION PRICE. FOR EQUIPMENT, CONSUMABLES, AND MOST SOFTWARE LICENSES SOLD BY US, CONTROL TRANSFERS TO THE CUSTOMER AT A POINT IN TIME. WE USE PRESENT RIGHT TO PAYMENT, LEGAL TITLE, PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE ASSET, AND RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP AS INDICATORS TO DETERMINE THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO THE CUSTOMER. WHERE ACCEPTANCE IS NOT A FORMALITY, THE CUSTOMER MUST HAVE DOCUMENTED THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE. FOR PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE INSTALLATION, IF THE INSTALLATION MEETS THE CRITERIA TO BE CONSIDERED A SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, PRODUCT REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL HAS PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, AND RECOGNITION OF INSTALLATION REVENUE OCCURS ONCE COMPLETED. PRODUCT REVENUE, INCLUDING SALES TO RESELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS IS REDUCED FOR PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTIES, RETURNS, AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED.  REVENUE FROM SERVICES INCLUDES EXTENDED WARRANTY, CUSTOMER AND SOFTWARE SUPPORT INCLUDING: SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE, POST CONTRACT SUPPORT, CONSULTING INCLUDING COMPANION DIAGNOSTICS, AND TRAINING AND EDUCATION. INSTRUMENT SERVICE CONTRACTS AND SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY ANNUAL CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE BILLED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CONTRACT OR MAINTENANCE PERIOD. THESE CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO REVENUE OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD, AS A TIME-BASED MEASURE OF PROGRESS BEST REFLECTS OUR PERFORMANCE IN SATISFYING THIS OBLIGATION. THERE ARE NO DEFERRED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE CONTRACT, AS THE COST OF THE SERVICE IS RECORDED WHEN THE SERVICE IS PERFORMED. SERVICE CALLS ARE RECOGNIZED TO REVENUE AT THE TIME A SERVICE IS PERFORMED.  WE HAVE  SALES FROM STANDALONE SOFTWARE. THESE ARRANGEMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE SOFTWARE LICENSES AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS, BOTH OF WHICH WE HAVE DETERMINED ARE DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. WE DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO ALLOCATE TO THE LICENSE AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACT BASED ON THE RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE OF EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT THE POINT IN TIME WHEN CONTROL HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. THE REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE CONTRACT IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE MAINTENANCE PERIOD, WHICH IS THE CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THE CONTRACT, AS A TIME-BASED MEASURE OF PROGRESS BEST REFLECTS OUR PERFORMANCE IN SATISFYING THIS OBLIGATION. UNSPECIFIED RIGHTS TO SOFTWARE UPGRADES ARE TYPICALLY SOLD AS PART OF THE MAINTENANCE CONTRACT ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS.  OUR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY COMPRISED OF A COMBINATION OF INSTRUMENTS, INSTALLATION OR OTHER START-UP SERVICES, AND/OR SOFTWARE, AND/OR SUPPORT OR SERVICES. HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ELEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY DELIVERED AT THE SAME TIME AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER. SERVICE REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE CONTRACTUAL PERIOD OR AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER. OUR ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY PROVISIONS FOR CANCELLATION, TERMINATION, OR REFUNDS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT RECOGNIZED REVENUE.  FOR CONTRACTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, WE ALLOCATE THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BASED ON RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICES AND RECOGNIZE THE RELATED REVENUE WHEN OR AS CONTROL OF EACH INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS. WE ESTIMATE THE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE BY CALCULATING THE AVERAGE HISTORICAL SELLING PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PER COUNTRY FOR EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICES ARE DETERMINED AT CONTRACT INCEPTION FOR EACH DISTINCT GOOD OR SERVICE IN THE CONTRACT AND THEN WE ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE IN PROPORTION TO THOSE STANDALONE SELLING PRICES BY PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  CERTAIN OF OUR REVENUE RELATE TO LEASE ARRANGEMENTS. STANDALONE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF ASC 606 AND ARE THEREFORE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 840, LEASES. EACH OF THESE CONTRACTS IS EVALUATED AS A LEASE ARRANGEMENT, EITHER AS AN OPERATING LEASE OR A SALES-TYPE CAPITAL LEASE USING THE CURRENT LEASE CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE.  ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES.  WE MUST MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OCCUR IN THE CALCULATION OF TAX CREDITS, BENEFITS AND DEDUCTIONS, AND IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WHICH ARISE FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES, AS WELL AS INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THESE ESTIMATES MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX PROVISION IN A SUBSEQUENT PERIOD. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WE PROVIDE FOR INCOME TAXES BASED UPON AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE GEOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF WORLDWIDE EARNINGS, TAX REGULATIONS GOVERNING EACH REGION, AVAILABILITY OF TAX CREDITS AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES.  WE MONITOR THE CHANGES IN MANY FACTORS AND ADJUST OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE ON A TIMELY BASIS.  IF ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHETHER DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED IN FULL OR IN PART. WHEN IT IS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT ALL OR SOME PORTION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS MAY NOT BE REALIZED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE MUST BE ESTABLISHED AGAINST SUCH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE ON A JURISDICTION-BY-JURISDICTION BASIS WHEN ASSESSING WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE RECOVERABLE. WE CONSIDER EVIDENCE SUCH AS OUR PAST OPERATING RESULTS, THE EXISTENCE OF LOSSES IN RECENT YEARS AND OUR FORECAST OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. AT  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN U.S. AND U.S STATE AND FOREIGN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN THESE JURISDICTIONS UNTIL SUFFICIENT POSITIVE EVIDENCE EXISTS TO SUPPORT ITS REVERSAL.  THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX LAW AND REGULATIONS IN A MULTITUDE OF JURISDICTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES PRESCRIBES THE USE OF A RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT MODEL, THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION HAS MET THOSE THRESHOLDS WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT BY MANAGEMENT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES, FOR ALL U.S. AND OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS, WE RECOGNIZE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED TAX AUDIT ISSUES BASED ON OUR ESTIMATE OF WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL TAXES AND INTEREST WILL BE DUE. THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF TAX UNCERTAINTIES MAY DIFFER FROM WHAT IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPACT ON INCOME TAX EXPENSE. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF INCOME TAX LIABILITIES PROVES TO BE LESS THAN THE ULTIMATE ASSESSMENT, A FURTHER CHARGE TO EXPENSE WOULD BE REQUIRED. IF EVENTS OCCUR AND THE PAYMENT OF THESE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY PROVES TO BE UNNECESSARY, THE REVERSAL OF THE LIABILITIES WOULD RESULT IN TAX BENEFITS BEING RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD WHEN WE DETERMINE THE LIABILITIES ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY. WE INCLUDE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WITHIN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX ACT WAS ENACTED INTO LAW. THE TAX ACT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGES THE EXISTING U.S. TAX LAW AND INCLUDES NUMEROUS PROVISIONS THAT AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. THERE WERE NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES FROM OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K TO THE TRANSITION TAX EXPENSES AMOUNT. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE FURTHER GUIDANCE FROM FEDERAL AND STATE TAX AUTHORITIES ON ITS BUSINESS AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ANY FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS DISCRETE INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE DETERMINED. WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR ANALYSIS AND ELECTED TO TREAT GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAX INCOME (\"GILTI\") AS \u201cCURRENT PERIOD COST\u201d.  SEE NOTE 5, \"INCOME TAXES\" FOR MORE DETAILS.  ADOPTION OF NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE NOTE 2, \u201cNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS,\u201d TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  FOREIGN CURRENCY  OUR REVENUES, COSTS AND EXPENSES, AND MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AS A RESULT OF OUR GLOBAL OPERATING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAS DECREASED REVENUE BY APPROXIMATELY  3  PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  . WHEN MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON REVENUE IT WILL ALSO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR COSTS AND EXPENSES. WE CALCULATE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES MOVEMENTS BY APPLYING THE ACTUAL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE LAST MONTH OF EACH QUARTER OF THE CURRENT YEAR TO BOTH THE APPLICABLE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. WE HEDGE REVENUES, EXPENSES AND BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES THAT ARE NOT DENOMINATED IN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ON A SHORT TERM AND ANTICIPATED BASIS. WE DO EXPERIENCE SOME FLUCTUATIONS WITHIN INDIVIDUAL LINES OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND BALANCE SHEET BECAUSE OUR HEDGING PROGRAM IS NOT DESIGNED TO OFFSET THE CURRENCY MOVEMENTS IN EACH CATEGORY OF REVENUES, EXPENSES, MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO HEDGE CURRENCY MOVEMENTS ON A RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM BASIS (UP TO A ROLLING TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD). THEREFORE, WE ARE EXPOSED TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OVER THE LONGER TERM. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR ALL, OR PORTIONS, OF AN ACQUISITION PRICE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WE MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE THE RISK THAT CURRENCY MOVEMENTS WILL IMPACT THE U.S. DOLLAR COST OF THE TRANSACTION.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS  NET REVENUE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  SIX MONTHS ENDED  YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE  APRIL 30,  APRIL 30,  THREE  SIX  2019  2018  2019  2018  MONTHS  MONTHS  (IN MILLIONS)  NET REVENUE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  HAD AN  UNFAVORABLE  IMPACT ON REVENUE OF APPROXIMATELY  3  PERCENTAGE POINTS IN BOTH PERIODS WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS LAST YEAR.  SERVICES AND OTHER REVENUE INCREASED  10 PERCENT  AND  9 PERCENT  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY,  WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS LAST YEAR. SERVICES AND OTHER REVENUE PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF REVENUE GENERATED FROM AGILENT CROSSLAB SERVICES AND SERVICES IN THE DIAGNOSTICS AND GENOMICS BUSINESS. SOME OF THE PROMINENT SERVICES IN THE AGILENT CROSSLAB BUSINESS INCLUDE REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE ON MULTI-VENDOR INSTRUMENTS, COMPLIANCE SERVICES AND INSTALLATION SERVICES. SOME OF THE PROMINENT SERVICES IN THE DIAGNOSTICS AND GENOMICS BUSINESS INCLUDE CONSULTING SERVICES RELATED TO THE COMPANION DIAGNOSTICS AND NUCLEIC ACID BUSINESSES.  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  , THE SERVICE REVENUE FROM THE AGILENT CROSSLAB BUSINESS INCREASED 7 PERCENT IN BOTH PERIODS WITH A 4 PERCENTAGE POINT UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACT IN BOTH PERIODS WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS LAST YEAR.   THE GROWTH IN THE SERVICE REVENUE FROM THE AGILENT CROSSLAB BUSINESS FOR BOTH PERIODS WERE DRIVEN BY THE IMPROVING CONNECT SERVICE RATE ON CURRENT INSTALLED INSTRUMENT BASE, AS WELL AS INCREASE IN HIGHER VALUE SERVICE OFFERINGS. FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, THE SERVICE REVENUE FROM THE DIAGNOSTICS AND GENOMICS BUSINESS INCREASED 26 PERCENT AND 22 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS LAST YEAR.

GILTI.  THE TAX ACT SUBJECTS A U.S. CORPORATION TO TAX ON ITS GILTI.  U.S. GAAP ALLOWS COMPANIES TO MAKE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO EITHER (1) TREAT TAXES DUE ON FUTURE GILTI INCLUSIONS IN THE U.S. TAXABLE INCOME AS A CURRENT-PERIOD EXPENSE WHEN INCURRED (\u201cPERIOD COST METHOD\u201d) OR (2) FACTORING SUCH AMOUNTS INTO A COMPANY\u2019S MEASUREMENT OF ITS DEFERRED TAXES (\u201cDEFERRED METHOD\u201d).

THERE WERE NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES FROM OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K TO THE STATUS OF THE OPEN TAX YEARS IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS DUE TO EITHER THE EXPIRATION OF A STATUTE OF LIMITATION OR A TAX AUDIT SETTLEMENT. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF YEARS AND NUMEROUS MATTERS THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION IN VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS, MANAGEMENT IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE CHANGES TO THE BALANCE OF OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE FURTHER GUIDANCE FROM FEDERAL AND STATE TAX AUTHORITIES ON ITS BUSINESS AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ANY FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS DISCRETE INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE DETERMINED.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  WAS RELATIVELY FLAT WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS LAST YEAR.

THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL OPERATING EXPENSES FROM RECENT ACQUISITIONS, HIGHER WAGES AND HIGHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS.

WE SELL A RAPIDLY CHANGING ASSORTMENT OF APPAREL, HOME FASHIONS AND OTHER MERCHANDISE AT PRICES GENERALLY 20% TO 60% BELOW FULL-PRICE RETAILERS\u2019 (INCLUDING DEPARTMENT, SPECIALTY AND MAJOR ONLINE RETAILERS) REGULAR PRICES ON COMPARABLE MERCHANDISE, EVERY DAY. WE OPERATE NEARLY  4,400  STORES THROUGH OUR FOUR MAIN SEGMENTS: IN THE U.S., MARMAXX (WHICH OPERATES T.J. MAXX, MARSHALLS AND TJMAXX.COM) AND HOMEGOODS (WHICH OPERATES HOMEGOODS AND HOMESENSE); TJX CANADA (WHICH OPERATES WINNERS, HOMESENSE AND MARSHALLS IN CANADA); AND TJX INTERNATIONAL (WHICH OPERATES T.K.

IN ADDITION TO OUR FOUR MAIN SEGMENTS, SIERRA OPERATES SIERRA.COM AND RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. THE RESULTS OF SIERRA ARE INCLUDED IN THE MARMAXX SEGMENT.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  .  \u2013  NET SALES INCREASED  7%  TO  $9.3 BILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020  OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S  FIRST  QUARTER SALES OF  $8.7 BILLION  . AT  MAY 4, 2019  , THE NUMBER OF STORES IN OPERATION INCREASED  6%  AND SELLING SQUARE FOOTAGE INCREASED  4%  COMPARED TO THE END OF THE FISCAL  2019  FIRST  QUARTER.  \u2013  COMP SALES INCREASED  5%  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020  OVER AN INCREASE OF  3%  FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR ENDED  MAY 5, 2018  . CUSTOMER TRAFFIC WAS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THE COMP SALES INCREASE AND WAS UP AT ALL FOUR MAJOR SEGMENTS.  \u2013  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020  WERE  $0.57  VERSUS  $0.56  PER SHARE IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  \u2013  OUR PRE-TAX MARGIN (THE RATIO OF PRE-TAX INCOME TO NET SALES) FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  10.1%  , A  0.9  PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE COMPARED WITH  11.0%  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  \u2013  OUR COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, RATIO FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  71.5%  , A  0.4  PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE COMPARED WITH  71.1%  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  \u2013  OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cSG&A\u201d) EXPENSE RATIO FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  18.3%  , A  0.5  PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE COMPARED WITH  17.8%  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  \u2013  OUR CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE PER STORE INVENTORIES, INCLUDING INVENTORY ON HAND AT OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS (WHICH EXCLUDES INVENTORY IN TRANSIT) AND EXCLUDING OUR E-COMMERCE SITES AND SIERRA STORES, WERE UP 6% ON A REPORTED BASIS AND 7% ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS AT THE END OF THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  AS COMPARED TO A 7% INCREASE IN AVERAGE PER STORE INVENTORIES ON A REPORTED BASIS AND A 6% INCREASE ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  \u2013  DURING THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020  , WE RETURNED $589 MILLION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  IMPACT OF BREXIT  THE U.K\u2019S DECISION TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION (\u201cEU\u201d), COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS \u201cBREXIT\u201d, REMAINS UNSETTLED.  SHOULD THE U.K. EXIT THE EU, THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE OUTCOMES EACH OF WHICH CREATES RISKS FOR TJX, ESPECIALLY IN OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS.  OUR TJX EUROPE MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS EVALUATED A RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF CONCERN AND IMPLEMENTED STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THEM.  OUR CURRENT EUROPEAN OPERATIONS BENEFIT FROM THE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND LABOR BETWEEN THE U.K. AND EU.  AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE BREXIT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY MOVE MERCHANDISE BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU. BREXIT COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR TALENT IN THE REGION, BOTH BY IMPACTING CURRENT ASSOCIATES, WHO ARE EITHER EU CITIZENS WORKING IN THE U.K. OR U.K. CITIZENS WORKING IN THE EU, AND POTENTIALLY IMPACTING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION FOR OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.  IF THE U.K. DOES EXIT THE EU, THIS WOULD SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE THAT FLOWS BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU. WE HAVE REALIGNED OUR EUROPEAN DIVISION\u2019S SUPPLY CHAIN TO REDUCE THE VOLUME OF MERCHANDISE FLOWING BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU AND HAVE ESTABLISHED RESOURCES AND SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT THIS PLAN. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR ASSOCIATES ABOUT BREXIT INCLUDING BY PROVIDING RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES THAT MAY BE REQUIRED POST-BREXIT.  23  WE BELIEVE THESE STEPS WILL HELP US MITIGATE THE OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT WE EXPECT COULD RESULT FROM BREXIT.  IF, HOWEVER, BREXIT HAPPENS WITHOUT A COMPREHENSIVE WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU AND THEREFORE, WITHOUT A LONGER TRANSITIONAL PERIOD, OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED, PARTICULARLY IN THE SHORT TERM.  WE BELIEVE THAT OVER TIME WE WOULD IMPLEMENT APPROPRIATE STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THAT OUTCOME.  NET SALES  CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  TOTALED  $9.3 BILLION  , A  7%  INCREASE OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S CONSOLIDATED  FIRST  QUARTER NET SALES OF  $8.7 BILLION  . THE INCREASE REFLECTS A  5%  INCREASE FROM COMP SALES, A 3% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES, OFFSET BY A 1% NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THIS INCREASE COMPARES TO SALES GROWTH OF 12% IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , WHICH REFLECTS A 6% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES, A 3% INCREASE FROM COMP SALES, AND A 3% POSITIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  AS OF  MAY 4, 2019  , OUR CONSOLIDATED STORE COUNT INCREASED  6%  AND SELLING SQUARE FOOTAGE INCREASED  4%  COMPARED TO THE END OF THE  FIRST  QUARTER LAST YEAR.  CONSOLIDATED COMP SALES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  REFLECTS AN INCREASE IN THE CUSTOMER TRAFFIC ACROSS ALL MAJOR DIVISIONS. ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, APPAREL CATEGORIES OUTPERFORMED HOME CATEGORIES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  MAY 4, 2019.  FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  , COMP SALES GROWTH IN THE U.S. WAS STRONGEST IN THE SOUTHEAST, GREAT LAKES AND THE SOUTHWEST REGIONS. COMP SALES GROWTH FOR OUR TJX INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT WAS ABOVE THE CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE, WHEREAS TJX CANADA WAS BELOW THE CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE.  WE DEFINE COMPARABLE STORE SALES, OR COMP SALES, TO BE SALES OF STORES THAT HAVE BEEN IN OPERATION FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF TWO CONSECUTIVE FISCAL YEARS, OR IN OTHER WORDS, STORES THAT ARE STARTING THEIR THIRD FISCAL YEAR OF OPERATION. WE CALCULATE COMP SALES ON A 52-WEEK BASIS BY COMPARING THE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR WEEKLY PERIODS THAT ARE MOST CLOSELY ALIGNED. RELOCATED STORES AND STORES THAT HAVE CHANGED IN SIZE ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE ORIGINAL STORE, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE IMPACT OF THESE STORES ON THE CONSOLIDATED COMP PERCENTAGE IS IMMATERIAL.  WE DEFINE CUSTOMER TRAFFIC TO BE THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN STORES INCLUDED IN THE COMP SALES CALCULATION AND AVERAGE TICKET TO BE THE AVERAGE RETAIL PRICE OF THE UNITS SOLD. WE DEFINE AVERAGE TRANSACTION OR AVERAGE BASKET TO BE THE AVERAGE DOLLAR VALUE OF TRANSACTIONS INCLUDED IN THE COMP SALES CALCULATION.  SALES EXCLUDED FROM COMP SALES (\u201cNON-COMP SALES\u201d) CONSIST OF SALES FROM.  \u2013  NEW STORES - STORES THAT HAVE NOT YET MET THE COMP SALES CRITERIA, WHICH REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF NON-COMP SALES  \u2013  STORES THAT ARE CLOSED PERMANENTLY OR FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME  \u2013  SALES FROM OUR E-COMMERCE SITES, MEANING SIERRA.COM, TJMAXX.COM AND TKMAXX.COM  WE DETERMINE WHICH STORES ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMP SALES CALCULATION AT THE BEGINNING OF A FISCAL YEAR AND THE CLASSIFICATION REMAINS CONSTANT THROUGHOUT THAT YEAR UNLESS A STORE IS CLOSED PERMANENTLY OR FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD DURING THAT FISCAL YEAR. STARTING IN FISCAL 2020, SIERRA STORES THAT OTHERWISE FIT THE COMP STORE DEFINITION ARE INCLUDED IN COMP STORES IN OUR MARMAXX SEGMENT.  COMP SALES OF OUR FOREIGN SEGMENTS ARE CALCULATED BY TRANSLATING THE CURRENT YEAR\u2019S COMP SALES OF OUR FOREIGN SEGMENTS AT THE SAME EXCHANGE RATES USED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS REMOVES THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A MORE ACCURATE MEASURE OF SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  COMP SALES MAY BE REFERRED TO AS \u201cSAME STORE\u201d SALES BY OTHER RETAIL COMPANIES. THE METHOD FOR CALCULATING COMP SALES VARIES ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY, THEREFORE OUR MEASURE OF COMP SALES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THAT OF OTHER RETAIL COMPANIES.  24  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE FOLLOWING PERIODS.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  MAY 5, 2018  NET SALES  100.0%  100.0%  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  71.5  71.1  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  18.3  17.8  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  \u2014  \u2014  INCOME BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  *  10.1%  11.0%  *  FIGURES MAY NOT FOOT DUE TO ROUNDING.  IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES  .  OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR OR A DIVISION\u2019S LOCAL CURRENCY IN RELATION TO OTHER CURRENCIES. TWO WAYS IN WHICH FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AFFECT OUR REPORTED RESULTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u2013  TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN OPERATING RESULTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS.  IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE TRANSLATE THE OPERATIONS OF TJX CANADA AND TJX INTERNATIONAL FROM LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING CURRENCY RATES IN EFFECT AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN COMPARABLE PRIOR PERIODS CAN RESULT IN MEANINGFUL VARIATIONS IN CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH AS WELL AS THE NET SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS OF THESE SEGMENTS. CURRENCY TRANSLATION GENERALLY DOES NOT AFFECT OPERATING MARGINS, OR AFFECTS THEM ONLY SLIGHTLY, AS SALES AND EXPENSES OF THE FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE TRANSLATED AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME RATES WITHIN A GIVEN PERIOD.  \u2013  INVENTORY-RELATED DERIVATIVES.  WE ROUTINELY ENTER INTO INVENTORY-RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON EARNINGS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON MERCHANDISE PURCHASES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE LOCAL CURRENCIES OF OUR DIVISIONS, PRINCIPALLY TJX CANADA AND TJX INTERNATIONAL. AS WE HAVE NOT ELECTED \u201cHEDGE ACCOUNTING\u201d FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS, AS DEFINED BY U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d), WE RECORD A MARK-TO-MARKET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD. IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS, THE INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT OF THE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT IS EFFECTIVELY OFFSET WHEN THE INVENTORY BEING HEDGED IS RECEIVED AND PAID FOR. WHILE THESE EFFECTS OCCUR EVERY REPORTING PERIOD, THEY ARE OF MUCH GREATER MAGNITUDE WHEN THERE ARE SUDDEN AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES DURING A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT ON THESE DERIVATIVES DOES NOT AFFECT NET SALES, BUT IT DOES AFFECT THE COST OF SALES, OPERATING MARGINS AND EARNINGS WE REPORT.  WE REFER TO THE IMPACT OF THE ABOVE TWO ITEMS THROUGHOUT OUR DISCUSSION AS \u201cFOREIGN CURRENCY.\u201d THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CAN HAVE ON VARIOUS TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN AN OPERATING DIVISION\u2019S LOCAL CURRENCY. WHEN DISCUSSING THE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF THE EFFECT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON SUCH TRANSACTIONS WE REFER TO IT AS \u201cTRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE.\u201d  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS  71.5%  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  , AN INCREASE OF  0.4  PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM  71.1%  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . THE INCREASE FOR THE QUARTER WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS AND A DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EXPENSE LEVERAGE ON THE STRONG COMP SALES GROWTH.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SG&A EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, WERE  18.3%  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  , AN INCREASE OF  0.5  PERCENTAGE POINTS OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S  FIRST  QUARTER RATIO OF  17.8%  . THE INCREASE IN SG&A WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO STORE WAGE INCREASES, AN UNFAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON ON A GAIN RELATED TO A LEASE BUYOUT IN FISCAL 2019, AND INCREMENTAL SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS.  25  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  THE COMPONENTS OF INTEREST EXPENSE, NET ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  IN THOUSANDS  MAY 4,  2019  MAY 5,  2018  INTEREST EXPENSE  $15,357  $17,365  CAPITALIZED INTEREST  (719  )  (1,648  )  INTEREST (INCOME)  (13,821  )  (11,569  )  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  $817  $4,148  THE DECREASE IN NET INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL  2019  , WAS DRIVEN BY ADDITIONAL INTEREST INCOME, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER RETURN RATES, AND THE REDUCTION OF INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO THE ELIMINATION OF BUILD-TO-SUIT ACCOUNTING AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE A\u2014  BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS  25.2%  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO  25.0%  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  .  THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REDUCTION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFIT FROM SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND THE EXPANDED LIMITATIONS ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION, OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN THE IMPACT OF THE FOREIGN OPERATIONS.  NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE  NET INCOME FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS $700 MILLION  , OR $0.57  PER DILUTED SHARE COMPARED WITH $716 MILLION  , OR  $0.56  PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . FOREIGN CURRENCY HAD A NEUTRAL IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO A $0.01 POSITIVE IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS, WHICH REDUCE OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING, BENEFITED OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH BY APPROXIMATELY 3% IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020.  SEGMENT INFORMATION  WE OPERATE FOUR MAIN BUSINESS SEGMENTS. OUR MARMAXX SEGMENT (T.J. MAXX, MARSHALLS AND TJMAXX.COM) AND THE HOMEGOODS SEGMENT (HOMEGOODS AND HOMESENSE) BOTH OPERATE IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR TJX CANADA SEGMENT OPERATES WINNERS, HOMESENSE AND MARSHALLS IN CANADA, AND OUR TJX INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT OPERATES T.K. MAXX, HOMESENSE AND TKMAXX.COM IN EUROPE AND T.K. MAXX IN AUSTRALIA. IN ADDITION TO OUR FOUR MAIN SEGMENTS, SIERRA OPERATES SIERRA.COM AND RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. THE RESULTS OF SIERRA ARE INCLUDED IN THE MARMAXX SEGMENT.  WE EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SEGMENTS BASED ON \u201cSEGMENT PROFIT OR LOSS,\u201d WHICH WE DEFINE AS PRE-TAX INCOME OR LOSS BEFORE GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE, NET. \u201cSEGMENT PROFIT OR LOSS,\u201d AS WE DEFINE THE TERM, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER ENTITIES. THE TERMS \u201cSEGMENT MARGIN\u201d OR \u201cSEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN\u201d ARE USED TO DESCRIBE SEGMENT PROFIT OR LOSS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES. THESE MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS AN INDICATOR OF OUR PERFORMANCE OR AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY.  PRESENTED BELOW IS SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  26  U.S. SEGMENTS  MARMAXX  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  IN MILLIONS  MAY 4,  2019  MAY 5,  2018  NET SALES  $5,802  $5,381  SEGMENT PROFIT  $796  $750  SEGMENT PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  13.7%  13.9%  INCREASE IN COMP SALES  6%  4%  STORES IN OPERATION AT END OF PERIOD  T.J.

THE INCREASE IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER REPRESENTS A  6%  INCREASE FROM COMP SALES AND A  2%  INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES. THE INCREASE IN COMP SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC. GEOGRAPHICALLY, COMP SALES GROWTH IN THE QUARTER WERE STRONG THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. HOME FASHIONS AND APPAREL CATEGORIES BOTH WERE STRONG AND PERFORMED AT THE SEGMENT AVERAGE FOR THE PERIOD.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO  13.7%  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO  13.9%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE IN SEGMENT MARGIN FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN SUPPLY CHAIN  COSTS AND FREIGHT COSTS. THIS WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY THE EXPENSE LEVERAGE ON THE STRONG COMP SALES. MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS SLIGHTLY DOWN DUE TO FREIGHT COSTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  OUR U.S. E-COMMERCE BUSINESSES, WHICH REPRESENT LESS THAN 3% OF MARMAXX\u2019S NET SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTERS OF FISCAL  2020  AND FISCAL 2019, DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON YEAR-OVER-YEAR SEGMENT MARGIN COMPARISONS FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020.  27  HOMEGOODS  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  IN MILLIONS  MAY 4,  2019  MAY 5,  2018  NET SALES  $1,397  $1,269  SEGMENT PROFIT  $137  $147  SEGMENT PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  9.8%  11.6%  INCREASE IN COMP SALES  1%  2%  STORES IN OPERATION AT END OF PERIOD  HOMEGOODS  770  690  HOMESENSE  22  4  TOTAL  792  694  SELLING SQUARE FOOTAGE AT END OF PERIOD (IN THOUSANDS)  HOMEGOODS  14,152  12,850  HOMESENSE  470  81  TOTAL  14,622  12,931  NET SALES FOR HOMEGOODS INCREASED  10%  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER REPRESENTS A  9%  INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES AND A  1%  INCREASE FROM COMP SALES. THE INCREASE IN COMP SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN WAS  9.8%  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO  11.6%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECLINE IN SEGMENT MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS ALONG WITH THE INVESTMENT IN STORE GROWTH AND EXPENSE DELEVERAGE ON THE  1%  COMP SALES INCREASE. MERCHANDISE MARGIN INCREASED SLIGHTLY FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR DESPITE INCREASED FREIGHT COSTS.  28  FOREIGN SEGMENTS  TJX CANADA  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  IN MILLIONS  MAY 4,  2019  MAY 5,  2018  NET SALES  $848  $854  SEGMENT PROFIT  $97  $125  SEGMENT PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  11.4%  14.7%  INCREASE IN COMP SALES  \u2014%  3%  STORES IN OPERATION AT END OF PERIOD  WINNERS  273  269  HOMESENSE  132  119  MARSHALLS  91  78  TOTAL  496  466  SELLING SQUARE FOOTAGE AT END OF PERIOD (IN THOUSANDS)  WINNERS  5,865  5,811  HOMESENSE  2,425  2,214  MARSHALLS  1,929  1,696  TOTAL  10,219  9,721  NET SALES FOR TJX CANADA DECREASED  1%  DURING THE  FIRST  QUARTER ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.

SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO  11.4%  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO  14.7%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE IN THE SEGMENT MARGIN FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER REFLECTS AN UNFAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON RELATED TO A LEASE BUYOUT GAIN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  OF 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT. IN ADDITION, THE DECREASE IN SEGMENT MARGIN REFLECTS A DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN OF 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT AS WELL AS EXPENSE DELEVERAGE ON THE FLAT COMP SALES. THE DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS DRIVEN BY TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE AS THE CHANGE IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES INCREASED TJX CANADA'S COST OF MERCHANDISE PURCHASED IN U.S. DOLLARS AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  29  TJX INTERNATIONAL  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  IN MILLIONS  MAY 4,  2019  MAY 5,  2018  NET SALES  $1,231  $1,185  SEGMENT PROFIT  $28  $41  SEGMENT PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  2.3%  3.4%  INCREASE IN COMP SALES  8%  1%  STORES IN OPERATION AT END OF PERIOD  T.K.

THE INCREASE IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER REPRESENTS AN  8%  INCREASE IN COMP SALES GROWTH, A  4%  INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES, OFFSET BY AN  8%  NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE INCREASE IN COMP SALES WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC. E-COMMERCE SALES REPRESENT LESS THAN 3% OF TJX INTERNATIONAL\u2019S NET SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTERS OF FISCAL  2020  AND FISCAL  2019.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO  2.3%  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO  3.4%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE IN SEGMENT MARGIN FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS DRIVEN BY THE YEAR-OVER YEAR MARK-TO-MARKET IMPACT OF THE INVENTORY DERIVATIVES OF 1.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET EXPENSE LEVERAGE ON THE STRONG COMP SALES GROWTH.  GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  IN MILLIONS  MAY 4,  2019  MAY 5,  2018  GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE  $121  $104  GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES REPRESENTS THOSE COSTS NOT SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES ARE PRIMARILY INCLUDED IN SG&A EXPENSES. THE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT OF OUR FUEL HEDGES IS INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND BENEFIT RELATED COSTS.  ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN FUNDED THROUGH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, SUPPLEMENTED, AS NEEDED, BY SHORT-TERM BANK BORROWINGS AND THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. AS OF  MAY 4, 2019  , THERE WERE NO SHORT-TERM BANK BORROWINGS OR COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING.  WE BELIEVE OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS AND OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, DESCRIBED IN  NOTE I  \u2013  LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT LINES  OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ARE MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR OPERATING NEEDS OVER THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR.  AS OF  MAY 4, 2019  , WE HELD  $2.2 BILLION  IN CASH AND  NO  SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. APPROXIMATELY  $0.6 BILLION  OF OUR CASH WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WITH  $0.3 BILLION  HELD IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE PROVISIONALLY INTEND TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST ANY UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS. TJX PROVIDED FOR ALL APPLICABLE STATE AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES ON ALL UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN CANADA, PUERTO RICO, ITALY, INDIA, HONG KONG AND VIETNAM THROUGH  MAY 4, 2019  . IF WE REPATRIATE CASH FROM SUCH SUBSIDIARIES, WE SHOULD NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL TAX EXPENSE AND OUR CASH WOULD BE REDUCED BY THE AMOUNT OF WITHHOLDING TAXES PAID.  30  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $0.1 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019  AND  $0.7 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 5, 2018  . THE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN EACH OF THESE FISCAL QUARTERS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING EARNINGS.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOR THE  FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  DECREASED  BY  $0.6 BILLION  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  .  THE DECLINE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, NET OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $0.4 BILLION.  IN ADDITION, LAST YEAR'S FIRST QUARTER CASH FLOWS WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY A DECREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSES DUE TO COSTS THAT WERE PREFUNDED IN THE FISCAL 2018 FOURTH QUARTER.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES RESULTED IN NET CASH OUTFLOWS OF  $0.3 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  AND  $0.2 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 5, 2018  . THE CASH OUTFLOWS FOR BOTH PERIODS WERE DRIVEN BY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF  FISCAL 2020  PRIMARILY REFLECTED PROPERTY ADDITIONS FOR NEW STORES, STORE IMPROVEMENTS AND RENOVATIONS AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN OUR OFFICES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, INCLUDING BUYING AND MERCHANDISING SYSTEMS AND OTHER INFORMATION SYSTEMS. CASH OUTFLOWS FOR PROPERTY ADDITIONS WERE  $0.3 BILLION  IN BOTH THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  AND FISCAL  2019  . WE ANTICIPATE THAT CAPITAL SPENDING FOR FISCAL  2020  WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION. WE PLAN TO FUND THESE EXPENDITURES THROUGH INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS.  WE PURCHASED  $0.1 BILLION  OF INVESTMENTS IN THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , AND THESE CASH OUTFLOWS WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY  $0.2 BILLION  OF INFLOWS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS THAT WERE SOLD OR MATURED IN THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  . THE FISCAL  2019  INVESTING ACTIVITY PRIMARILY RELATED TO SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WHICH HAD INITIAL MATURITIES IN EXCESS OF 90 DAYS AND ARE NOT CLASSIFIED AS CASH ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS PRESENTED.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES RESULTED IN NET CASH OUTFLOWS OF  $0.6 BILLION  IN THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF  FISCAL  2020  AND  $0.5 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 5, 2018  .  THESE CASH OUTFLOWS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY EQUITY REPURCHASES AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.  EQUITY  WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED  6.7 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A COST OF  $0.3 BILLION  DURING THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  , ON A \u201cTRADE DATE BASIS.\u201d WE REFLECT STOCK REPURCHASES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A \u201cSETTLEMENT DATE\u201d OR CASH BASIS. UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS, WE PAID  $0.4 BILLION  TO REPURCHASE  7.7 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR STOCK IN THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  . THESE OUTFLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, NET OF SHARES WITHHELD FOR TAXES IN THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  . WE PAID $0.4 BILLION TO REPURCHASE 9.7 MILLION SHARES ON A SETTLEMENT BASIS IN THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  . FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING EQUITY REPURCHASES, SEE  NOTE D  \u2013  CAPITAL STOCK AND EARNINGS PER SHARE  OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE REPURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL $3.0 BILLION OF TJX COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME. IN FEBRUARY 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN ADDITIONAL REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZING THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $1.5 BILLION OF TJX STOCK. AS OF MAY 4, 2019, APPROXIMATELY $2.8 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PLANS. WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO REPURCHASE APPROXIMATELY $1.75 BILLION TO $2.25 BILLION OF STOCK UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS IN FISCAL  2020  . WE DETERMINE THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REPURCHASES BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING EXCESS CASH FLOW, LIQUIDITY, ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR ASSESSMENT OF PROSPECTS FOR OUR BUSINESS, LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THESE PURCHASES MAY CHANGE.  DIVIDENDS  WE DECLARED QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK WHICH TOTALED  $0.23  PER SHARE IN THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  AND  $0.195  PER SHARE IN THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  . CASH PAYMENTS FOR DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK TOTALED  $0.2 BILLION  FOR BOTH THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  AND FISCAL  2019.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  OVERVIEW  MARTIN MARIETTA MATERIALS, INC. (THE COMPANY OR MARTIN MARIETTA) IS A NATURAL RESOURCE-BASED BUILDING MATERIALS COMPANY. THE COMPANY SUPPLIES AGGREGATES (CRUSHED STONE, SAND AND GRAVEL) THROUGH ITS NETWORK OF MORE THAN 300 QUARRIES, MINES AND DISTRIBUTION YARDS TO ITS CUSTOMERS IN 31 STATES, CANADA, THE BAHAMAS AND THE CARIBBEAN ISLANDS.  IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES, MARTIN MARIETTA ALSO PROVIDES CEMENT AND DOWNSTREAM PRODUCTS, NAMELY, READY MIXED CONCRETE, ASPHALT AND PAVING SERVICES, IN VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED STRUCTURED MARKETS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS A LEADING AGGREGATES POSITION.  THE COMPANY\u2019S HEAVY-SIDE BUILDING MATERIALS ARE USED IN INFRASTRUCTURE, NONRESIDENTIAL AND RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.  AGGREGATES ARE ALSO USED IN AGRICULTURAL, UTILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL APPLICATIONS AND AS RAILROAD BALLAST. THE AGGREGATES, CEMENT, READY MIXED CONCRETE AND ASPHALT AND PAVING PRODUCT LINES ARE REPORTED COLLECTIVELY AS THE \u201cBUILDING MATERIALS\u201d BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS BUILDING MATERIALS BUSINESS THROUGH THREE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: MID-AMERICA GROUP, SOUTHEAST GROUP AND WEST GROUP.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE COMPANY OUTLINED ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THERE WERE NO CHANGES TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  PAGE 26 OF 44  MARTIN MARIETTA MATERIALS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE QUARTER MARCH 31, 2019  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FIRST QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  (CONTINUED)  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE BUILDING MATERIALS BUSINESS IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY WEATHER PATTERNS AND SEASONAL CHANGES.  PRODUCTION AND SHIPMENT LEVELS FOR AGGREGATES, CEMENT, READY MIXED CONCRETE AND ASPHALT AND PAVING MATERIALS CORRELATE WITH GENERAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY LEVELS, MOST OF WHICH OCCUR IN THE SPRING, SUMMER AND FALL.  THUS, PRODUCTION AND SHIPMENT LEVELS VARY BY QUARTER.  OPERATIONS CONCENTRATED IN THE NORTHERN AND MIDWESTERN UNITED STATES GENERALLY EXPERIENCE MORE SEVERE WINTER WEATHER CONDITIONS THAN OPERATIONS IN THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST. EXCESSIVE RAINFALL, AND CONVERSELY EXCESSIVE DROUGHT, CAN ALSO JEOPARDIZE PRODUCTION, SHIPMENTS AND PROFITABILITY IN ALL MARKETS SERVED BY THE COMPANY.  DUE TO THE POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF WEATHER ON THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS, CURRENT PERIOD AND YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF EXPECTED PERFORMANCE FOR OTHER INTERIM PERIODS OR THE FULL YEAR.  EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EBITDA) IS A WIDELY ACCEPTED FINANCIAL INDICATOR OF A COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO SERVICE AND/OR INCUR INDEBTEDNESS.  EBITDA IS NOT DEFINED BY GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND, AS SUCH, SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET EARNINGS, OPERATING EARNINGS OR OPERATING CASH FLOW.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT EBITDA MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE OR ABILITY TO MEET ITS FUTURE DEBT SERVICE, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  BECAUSE EBITDA EXCLUDES SOME, BUT NOT ALL, ITEMS THAT AFFECT NET EARNINGS AND MAY VARY AMONG COMPANIES, EBITDA AS PRESENTED BY THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES.

(  4  )  TOTAL AGGREGATES OPERATIONS INCLUDE ACQUISITIONS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURES THROUGH THE DATE OF DISPOSAL.  FIRST-QUARTER OPERATING RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE ROBUST UNDERLYING DEMAND THAT WAS MASKED IN 2018 BY WEATHER, CONTRACTOR CAPACITY AND LOGISTICS DISRUPTIONS. WHILE WINTER WEATHER TRADITIONALLY LIMITS THE ABILITY OF OUTDOOR CONTRACTORS TO PERFORM WORK, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED RELATIVELY BETTER WEATHER DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019. THIS ALLOWED CONTRACTORS TO BEGIN ADDRESSING BACKLOGS WITH AN EARLIER-THAN-NORMAL START TO THE CONSTRUCTION SEASON. THE NOTABLE EXCEPTION WAS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S SECOND-LARGEST STATE BY REVENUES, COLORADO, WHICH EXPERIENCED ONE OF ITS HARSHEST WINTERS ON RECORD, DELAYING THE ONSET OF MEANINGFUL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY.  AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE MARKET INCREASED 2% AS MODESTLY IMPROVED WEATHER, PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTHEAST, ALLOWED CONTRACTORS TO ADVANCE TRANSPORTATION-RELATED PROJECTS EARLIER IN THE CONSTRUCTION SEASON. FOLLOWING MORE THAN A DECADE OF UNDERINVESTMENT, MANAGEMENT REMAINS CONFIDENT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE DEMAND IS POISED FOR MEANINGFUL GROWTH. FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE FIXING AMERICA\u2019S SURFACE TRANSPORTATION ACT (FAST ACT), COMBINED WITH  PAGE 31 OF 44  MARTIN MARIETTA MATERIALS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE QUARTER MARCH 31, 2019  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FIRST QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  (CONTINUED)  NUMEROUS STATE AND LOCAL TRANSPORTATION INITIATIVES, HAS RESULTED IN AN ACCELERATION IN LETTINGS AND CONTRACT AWARDS IN KEY STATES, INCLUDING TEXAS, COLORADO, NORTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA AND FLORIDA.  FOR THE QUARTER, THE INFRASTRUCTURE MARKET REPRESENTED 33%  OF AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS, WHICH IS BELOW THE COMPANY\u2019S MOST RECENT TEN-YEAR AVERAGE OF 46%  BUT CONSISTENT WITH FIRST-QUARTER HISTORICAL TRENDS.  AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS TO THE NONRESIDENTIAL MARKET INCREASED 33%, DRIVEN BY BOTH COMMERCIAL AND HEAVY INDUSTRIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY.  THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO BENEFIT FROM ROBUST DISTRIBUTION CENTER, WAREHOUSE, DATA CENTER AND WIND TURBINE PROJECTS IN KEY GEOGRAPHIES, INCLUDING TEXAS, THE CAROLINAS, GEORGIA AND IOWA. THE NONRESIDENTIAL MARKET REPRESENTED 37% OF FIRST-QUARTER AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS.  AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS TO THE RESIDENTIAL MARKET INCREASED 8%, DRIVEN BY WEATHER-DEFERRED HOMEBUILDING ACTIVITY IN THE CAROLINAS, GEORGIA AND FLORIDA. DESPITE THE RECENT SLOWDOWN IN HOUSING UNIT STARTS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION OUTLOOK ACROSS THE COMPANY\u2019S GEOGRAPHIC FOOTPRINT REMAINS POSITIVE FOR BOTH SINGLE- AND MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING, DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE DEMOGRAPHICS, JOB GROWTH, LAND AVAILABILITY, STEADY INTEREST RATES AND EFFICIENT PERMITTING. ON A NATIONAL LEVEL, HOUSING STARTS REMAIN BELOW THE 50-YEAR ANNUAL AVERAGE OF 1.5 MILLION DESPITE NOTABLE POPULATION GAINS. THE RESIDENTIAL MARKET ACCOUNTED FOR 23% OF FIRST-QUARTER AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS.  THE CHEMROCK/RAIL MARKET ACCOUNTED FOR THE REMAINING 7% OF FIRST-QUARTER AGGREGATES SHIPMENTS. VOLUMES TO THIS SECTOR DECREASED 9%, DRIVEN BY REDUCED AGRICULTURAL LIME SHIPMENTS FROM A DEPRESSED FARM ECONOMY.

FULL-YEAR CAPITAL SPENDING IS EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM $350 MILLION TO $400 MILLION.  THE COMPANY CAN REPURCHASE ITS COMMON STOCK THROUGH OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES PURSUANT TO AUTHORITY GRANTED BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR THROUGH PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS AT SUCH PRICES AND UPON SUCH TERMS AS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER DEEMS APPROPRIATE. THE COMPANY DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF COMMON STOCK DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, 14,147,751 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE REMAINING UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.  THE $700 MILLION REVOLVING FACILITY REQUIRES THE COMPANY\u2019S RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT-TO-CONSOLIDATED EBITDA, AS DEFINED, FOR THE TRAILING-TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD (THE RATIO) TO NOT EXCEED 3.50X AS OF THE END OF ANY FISCAL QUARTER, PROVIDED THAT THE COMPANY MAY EXCLUDE FROM THE RATIO DEBT INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS DURING THE QUARTER OR THE THREE PRECEDING QUARTERS SO LONG AS THE RATIO CALCULATED WITHOUT SUCH EXCLUSION DOES NOT EXCEED 3.75X. ADDITIONALLY, IF THERE ARE NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING FACILITY AND THE $400 MILLION TRADE RECEIVABLE FACILITY, CONSOLIDATED DEBT, INCLUDING DEBT FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS A CO-BORROWER, MAY BE REDUCED BY THE COMPANY\u2019S UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IN EXCESS OF $50 MILLION, SUCH REDUCTION NOT TO EXCEED $200 MILLION, FOR PURPOSES OF THE COVENANT CALCULATION.  THE RATIO IS CALCULATED AS DEBT, INCLUDING DEBT FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS A CO-BORROWER, DIVIDED BY CONSOLIDATED EBITDA, AS DEFINED BY THE COMPANY\u2019S REVOLVING FACILITY, FOR THE TRAILING-TWELVE MONTHS.  CONSOLIDATED EBITDA IS GENERALLY DEFINED AS EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAX EXPENSE, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR CONTINUING  PAGE 35 OF 44  MARTIN MARIETTA MATERIALS, INC.

IN THE EVENT OF A DEFAULT ON THE RATIO, THE LENDERS CAN TERMINATE THE REVOLVING FACILITY AND TRADE RECEIVABLE FACILITY AND DECLARE ANY OUTSTANDING BALANCES AS IMMEDIATELY DUE.  OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS ON THE TRADE RECEIVABLE FACILITY HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.  CASH ON HAND, ALONG WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S PROJECTED INTERNAL CASH FLOWS AND AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING RESOURCES, INCLUDING ITS ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS, IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE THE CAPITAL RESOURCES NECESSARY TO SUPPORT ANTICIPATED OPERATING NEEDS, COVER DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, ADDRESS NEAR-TERM DEBT MATURITIES, MEET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENT NEEDS, FUND CERTAIN ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY ARISE, ALLOW THE REPURCHASE OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK AND ALLOW FOR PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  ANY FUTURE SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC ACQUISITION FOR CASH WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE OF NEWLY-ISSUED EQUITY WITH DEBT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A COMPOSITE INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT RATING.

PAGE 39 OF 44  MARTIN MARIETTA MATERIALS, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  IT  EM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE CONSTRUCTION AND STEELMAKING INDUSTRIES. CONSEQUENTLY, THESE MARKETPLACES COULD EXPERIENCE LOWER LEVELS OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF RISING INTEREST RATES OR ESCALATING COSTS.  MANAGEMENT HAS CONSIDERED THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS. DEMAND FOR AGGREGATES PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE CONSTRUCTION MARKET, IS AFFECTED BY FEDERAL AND STATE BUDGET AND DEFICIT ISSUES. FURTHER, DELAYS OR CANCELLATIONS OF CAPITAL PROJECTS IN THE NONRESIDENTIAL AND RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION MARKETS COULD OCCUR IF COMPANIES AND CONSUMERS ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS OR IF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE CONTINUES TO BE ERODED BY ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY.  DEMAND IN THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION MARKET IS AFFECTED BY INTEREST RATES. THE FEDERAL RESERVE DID NOT CHANGE INTEREST RATES DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AT MARCH 31, 2019 WAS 2.4%. THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION MARKET ACCOUNTED FOR 22% OF THE COMPANY\u2019S AGGREGATES PRODUCT LINE SHIPMENTS IN 2018.  ASIDE FROM THESE INHERENT RISKS FROM WITHIN ITS OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES. HOWEVER, RISING INTEREST RATES ARE NOT NECESSARILY PREDICTIVE OF WEAKER OPERATING RESULTS. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY\u2019S PROFITABILITY INCREASED DURING PERIODS OF RISING INTEREST RATES. IN ESSENCE, THE COMPANY\u2019S UNDERLYING BUSINESS GENERALLY SERVES AS A NATURAL HEDGE TO RISING INTEREST RATES.  VARIABLE-RATE BORROWING FACILITIES.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD A $700 MILLION REVOLVING FACILITY AND A $400 MILLION TRADE RECEIVABLE FACILITY. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS $600 MILLION VARIABLE-RATE SENIOR NOTES.  BORROWINGS UNDER THESE FACILITIES BEAR INTEREST AT A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE. A HYPOTHETICAL 100-BASIS-POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ON BORROWINGS OF $1.03 BILLION, WHICH WAS THE COLLECTIVE OUTSTANDING BALANCE AT MARCH 31, 2019, WOULD INCREASE INTEREST EXPENSE BY $10.3 MILLION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.  PENSION EXPENSE.  THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY ITS PENSION EXPENSE. ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT PENSION EXPENSE INCLUDE THE DISCOUNT RATE AND, FOR THE QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ONLY, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY HAS INTEREST RATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS. THE IMPACT OF HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN THESE ASSUMPTIONS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE IS DISCUSSED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  ENERGY COSTS  . ENERGY COSTS, INCLUDING DIESEL FUEL, NATURAL GAS, COAL AND LIQUID ASPHALT, REPRESENT SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION COSTS OF THE COMPANY.  THE CEMENT OPERATIONS AND MAGNESIA SPECIALTIES BUSINESS HAVE FIXED PRICE AGREEMENTS COVERING 100% OF ITS 2019 COAL REQUIREMENTS.  ENERGY COSTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 6% OVER THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.  A HYPOTHETICAL 6% CHANGE IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ENERGY PRICES FOR THE FULL YEAR 2019 AS COMPARED WITH 2018, ASSUMING CONSTANT VOLUMES, WOULD CHANGE FULL YEAR 2019 ENERGY EXPENSE BY $17.0 MILLION.  COMMODITY RISK.  CEMENT IS A COMMODITY AND COMPETITION IS BASED PRINCIPALLY ON PRICE, WHICH IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN SUPPLY AND DEMAND. PRICES ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO MATERIAL CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO RELATIVELY MINOR FLUCTUATIONS IN SUPPLY AND DEMAND, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS BEYOND THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL. INCREASES IN THE PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS OR INCREASES IN CEMENT IMPORTS TEND TO CREATE AN OVERSUPPLY OF SUCH PRODUCTS LEADING TO AN IMBALANCE BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND, WHICH CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PRODUCT PRICES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT PRICES FOR PRODUCTS SOLD WILL NOT DECLINE IN THE FUTURE OR THAT SUCH DECLINES WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  ASSUMING TOTAL REVENUES FOR CEMENT FOR FULL-YEAR 2019 OF $420 MILLION TO $450 MILLION, A HYPOTHETICAL 10% CHANGE IN SALES PRICE WOULD IMPACT NET SALES BY $42.0 MILLION TO $45.0 MILLION.

AT  MARCH 29, 2019  , WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $334  MILLION  , AND WE HAVE A SENIOR UNSECURED $1 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT EXPIRES IN JUNE 2023 (OF WHICH $900 MILLION WAS AVAILABLE TO US AS OF  MARCH 29, 2019  , AS A RESULT OF $100 MILLION OF SHORT-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM). ADDITIONALLY, WE HAD  $3.4 BILLION  OF LONG-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING AT  MARCH 29, 2019  , THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ACQUISITION OF EXELIS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2015. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR LONG-TERM DEBT, SEE NOTE 13: \u201cDEBT\u201d IN OUR NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  FISCAL 2017-2018 UPDATE 8-K  . OUR  $334  MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT  MARCH 29, 2019  INCLUDED $141 MILLION HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, OF WHICH $67 MILLION WAS CONSIDERED PERMANENTLY REINVESTED. DETERMINING THE FUTURE TAX COST OF REPATRIATING SUCH FUNDS TO THE U.S. IS NOT PRACTICAL AT THIS TIME, BECAUSE THE COST IMPACT OF THE RULES REGARDING THE NETTING OF EARNINGS OF RELATED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IS SUBJECT TO CLARIFICATION. HOWEVER, WE HAVE NO CURRENT PLANS TO REPATRIATE THE FUNDS CONSIDERED PERMANENTLY REINVESTED.  GIVEN OUR CURRENT CASH POSITION, OUTLOOK FOR FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, CREDIT RATINGS, AVAILABLE CREDIT FACILITY, CASH NEEDS AND DEBT STRUCTURE, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED TO DATE, AND DO NOT EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE, ANY MATERIAL ISSUES WITH LIQUIDITY, ALTHOUGH WE CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCES CONCERNING OUR FUTURE LIQUIDITY, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF OUR OVERALL LEVEL OF DEBT, U.S. GOVERNMENT BUDGET UNCERTAINTIES (INCLUDING THE RECENT, OR ANY POTENTIAL SUCCESSIVE, U.S. GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN) AND THE STATE OF GLOBAL COMMERCE AND FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTY.  31  WE ALSO CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT EXISTING CASH, FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, OUR CREDIT FACILITY AND ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DEBT AND EQUITY MARKETS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE FOR OUR ANTICIPATED WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, REPURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND REPAYMENTS OF OUR DEBT SECURITIES AT MATURITY FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE FUTURE THEREAFTER. OUR TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL  2019  ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION. WE ANTICIPATE TAX PAYMENTS IN FISCAL  2019  TO BE LESS THAN OUR TAX EXPENSE FOR THE SAME PERIOD. OTHER THAN THOSE CASH OUTLAYS NOTED IN \u201cCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\u201d IN ITEM 7. \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d IN OUR  FISCAL 2017-2018 UPDATE 8-K  AND \u201cCOMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\u201d BELOW IN THIS MD&A, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, REPURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PENDING MERGER WITH L3 (INCLUDING TRANSACTION AND INTEGRATION COSTS), WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY SIGNIFICANT CASH OUTLAYS DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL  2019.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE CASH FLOWS AT CURRENT LEVELS OR THAT THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF FUTURE BORROWINGS, IF ANY, UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM OR OUR CREDIT FACILITY OR IN THE DEBT MARKETS WILL NOT BE IMPACTED BY ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE CREDIT OR CAPITAL MARKETS DISRUPTIONS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN CASH BALANCES OR GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO SERVICE OUR OBLIGATIONS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO SELL ASSETS, REDUCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, REDUCE OR ELIMINATE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, REDUCE OR TERMINATE OUR SHARE REPURCHASES, REDUCE OR ELIMINATE DIVIDENDS, REFINANCE ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR EXISTING DEBT OR OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING. OUR ABILITY TO MAKE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OR PAY INTEREST ON OR REFINANCE OUR INDEBTEDNESS DEPENDS ON OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL RESULTS, WHICH, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, ARE SUBJECT TO GENERAL CONDITIONS IN OR AFFECTING THE DEFENSE, GOVERNMENT AND OTHER MARKETS WE SERVE AND TO GENERAL ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, FINANCIAL, COMPETITIVE, LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  THE  $644 MILLION  INCREASE  IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED WITH THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $300 MILLION VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION TO OUR U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, THE IMPACT OF HIGHER NET INCOME, A  $115 MILLION  DECREASE IN CASH USED TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL, REFLECTING A REDUCTION IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES DESPITE HIGHER REVENUE, AND A  $50 MILLION  DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS TO DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  THE  $23 MILLION  INCREASE  IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED WITH THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A  $25 MILLION  INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR ADDITIONS OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  THE  $526 MILLION  INCREASE  IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED WITH THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO  $278 MILLION  OF NET REPAYMENTS OF BORROWINGS IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH  $185 MILLION  OF NET PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL 2018 AND A  $39 MILLION  INCREASE IN CASH USED TO PAY DIVIDENDS.  FUNDING OF PENSION PLANS  FUNDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE A MAJOR CONSIDERATION IN MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION IN MAKING VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS, THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED BY THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 AND FURTHER AMENDED BY THE WORKER, RETIREE, AND EMPLOYER RECOVERY ACT OF 2008, THE MOVING AHEAD FOR PROGRESS IN THE 21ST CENTURY ACT (\u201cMAP-21\u201d), AND APPLICABLE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REGULATIONS MANDATE MINIMUM FUNDING THRESHOLDS. FAILURE TO SATISFY THE MINIMUM FUNDING THRESHOLDS COULD RESULT IN RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO AMEND THE PLANS OR MAKE BENEFIT PAYMENTS. WITH RESPECT TO OUR U.S. QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WE INTEND TO CONTRIBUTE ANNUALLY NOT LESS THAN THE REQUIRED MINIMUM FUNDING THRESHOLDS.  THE HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION FUNDING ACT OF 2014 AND THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT OF 2015 FURTHER EXTENDED THE INTEREST RATE STABILIZATION PROVISION OF MAP-21 UNTIL 2020. WE MADE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR U.S. QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS OF $300 MILLION AND $400 MILLION DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 AND THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2  017, RESPECTIVELY. AS A RESULT, WE ANTICIPATE MAKING  NO  CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR  U.S. QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS  AND MINOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR NON-U.S. PENSION PLAN DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL  2019.  FUTURE REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS PRIMARILY WILL DEPEND ON THE ACTUAL ANNUAL RETURN ON ASSETS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT THE END OF EACH YEAR. DEPENDING ON THESE FACTORS, AND THE RESULTING FUNDED STATUS OF OUR PENSION PLANS, THE LEVEL OF FUTURE STATUTORY REQUIRED MINIMUM CONTRIBUTIONS COULD BE MATERIAL. WE HAD NET UNFUNDED DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS OF  $601 MILLION  AT  MARCH 29, 2019  . SEE NOTE 14: \u201cPENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\u201d IN OUR NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  FISCAL 2017-2018 UPDATE 8-K  AND  NOTE J \u2014 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS  IN THE NOTES FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR PENSION PLANS.  COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES  DURING THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  , WE USED  $200 MILLION  TO REPURCHASE  1,219,750  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF  $163.99  , INCLUDING COMMISSIONS OF  $.02  PER SHARE. DURING THE  32  FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2018  , WE USED  $197 MILLION  TO REPURCHASE  1,466,713  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF  $134.36  , INCLUDING COMMISSIONS OF  $.01  PER SHARE. IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  AND FISCAL  2018  ,  $24 MILLION  AND  $10 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, IN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WERE DELIVERED TO US OR WITHHELD BY US TO SATISFY WITHHOLDING TAXES ON EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED AWARDS. SHARES PURCHASED BY US ARE CANCELLED AND RETIRED.  AS OF  MARCH 29, 2019  , WE HAD A REMAINING, UNUSED AUTHORIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY  $501 MILLION  UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE. REPURCHASES UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM ARE EXPECTED TO BE FUNDED WITH AVAILABLE CASH AND COMMERCIAL PAPER AND MAY BE MADE THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS, TRANSACTIONS STRUCTURED THROUGH INVESTMENT BANKING INSTITUTIONS OR ANY COMBINATION THEREOF. THE LEVEL OF OUR REPURCHASES DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CASH FLOWS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND OTHER FACTORS OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY DEEM RELEVANT. THE TIMING, VOLUME AND NATURE OF REPURCHASES ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS, APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS AND OTHER FACTORS AND ARE AT OUR DISCRETION AND MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. PURSUANT TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT, WE WILL NOT MAKE REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT LEAST UNTIL AFTER CLOSING OF THE PENDING MERGER, WITHOUT L3\u2019S CONSENT. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS SET FORTH IN THIS REPORT UNDER PART II. ITEM 2. \u201cUNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.\u201d  DIVIDENDS  ON AUGUST 25, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND RATE ON OUR COMMON STOCK FROM $.570 PER SHARE TO $.685 PER SHARE, FOR AN ANNUALIZED CASH DIVIDEND RATE OF $2.740 PER SHARE, WHICH WAS OUR SEVENTEENTH CONSECUTIVE ANNUAL INCREASE IN OUR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND RATE. OUR ANNUALIZED CASH DIVIDEND RATE IN FISCAL  2018  WAS $2.280 PER SHARE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT OUR ANNUALIZED CASH DIVIDEND RATE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE. QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS ARE TYPICALLY PAID IN MARCH, JUNE, SEPTEMBER AND DECEMBER. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT CASH DIVIDENDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PAID IN THE NEAR FUTURE, BUT WE CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCES CONCERNING PAYMENT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS. THE DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS AND THE AMOUNT THEREOF WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CASH FLOWS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS AND OTHER FACTORS OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY DEEM RELEVANT.  CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND RESOURCES  2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT.  WE HAVE A $1 BILLION, 5-YEAR SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201c2018 CREDIT FACILITY\u201d) UNDER A REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201c2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) ENTERED INTO ON JUNE 26, 2018 WITH A SYNDICATE OF LENDERS.

WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS IN THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT AT  MARCH 29, 2019  , INCLUDING THE COVENANT REQUIRING THAT WE NOT PERMIT OUR RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS TO TOTAL CAPITAL, EACH AS DEFINED IN THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT, TO BE GREATER THAN 0.65 TO 1.00. AT  MARCH 29, 2019  , WE HAD NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT BUT WE HAD $100 MILLION IN BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE 2018 CREDIT FACILITY.

SHORT-TERM DEBT.  OUR SHORT-TERM DEBT AT  MARCH 29, 2019  AND  JUNE 29, 2018  WAS  $103 MILLION  AND  $78 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR SHORT-TERM DEBT AT  MARCH 29, 2019  AND  JUNE 29, 2018  CONSISTED OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LOCAL BORROWING BY INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES FOR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS. OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM WAS SUPPORTED AT  MARCH 29, 2019  AND  JUNE 29, 2018  BY THE 2018 CREDIT FACILITY.  OTHER AGREEMENTS.  WE HAVE A RSA WITH A THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT PERMITS US TO SELL, ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS, UP TO  $50 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES AT ANY GIVEN TIME. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE SOLD CERTAIN CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES UNDER THE RSA, WHICH WE CONTINUE TO SERVICE AND COLLECT ON BEHALF OF THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION AND WHICH WE ACCOUNT FOR AS SALES OF RECEIVABLES WITH SALE PROCEEDS INCLUDED IN NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE IMPACT TO NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS WAS NOT MATERIAL IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  AND  2018.  33  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DEFINITION UNDER SEC RULES, ANY OF THE FOLLOWING QUALIFY AS OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  \u2022  ANY OBLIGATION UNDER CERTAIN GUARANTEE CONTRACTS;  \u2022  A RETAINED OR CONTINGENT INTEREST IN ASSETS TRANSFERRED TO AN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY OR SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT THAT SERVES AS CREDIT, LIQUIDITY OR MARKET RISK SUPPORT TO THAT ENTITY FOR SUCH ASSETS;  \u2022  ANY OBLIGATION, INCLUDING A CONTINGENT OBLIGATION, UNDER CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS; AND  \u2022  ANY OBLIGATION, INCLUDING A CONTINGENT OBLIGATION, UNDER A MATERIAL VARIABLE INTEREST IN AN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY THAT IS HELD BY, AND MATERIAL TO, THE REGISTRANT, WHERE SUCH ENTITY PROVIDES FINANCING, LIQUIDITY, MARKET RISK OR CREDIT RISK SUPPORT TO THE REGISTRANT, OR ENGAGES IN LEASING, HEDGING OR R&D SERVICES WITH THE REGISTRANT.  AS OF  MARCH 29, 2019  , WE WERE NOT PARTICIPATING IN ANY MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS THAT GENERATED RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, INCLUDING VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, AND WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL RETAINED OR CONTINGENT INTEREST IN ASSETS AS DEFINED ABOVE. AS OF  MARCH 29, 2019  , WE DID NOT HAVE MATERIAL FINANCIAL GUARANTEES OR OTHER CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS, AND WE WERE NOT A PARTY TO ANY RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS THAT MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.  WE HAVE, FROM TIME TO TIME, DIVESTED CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES AND ASSETS. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE DIVESTITURES, WE OFTEN PROVIDE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND/OR INDEMNITIES TO COVER VARIOUS RISKS AND UNKNOWN LIABILITIES, SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND TAX LIABILITIES. WE CANNOT ESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY FROM SUCH REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES BECAUSE THEY RELATE TO UNKNOWN CONDITIONS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT THE LIABILITIES RELATING TO THESE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.  DUE TO OUR DOWNSIZING OF CERTAIN OPERATIONS PURSUANT TO ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES, RESTRUCTURING PLANS OR OTHERWISE, CERTAIN PROPERTIES LEASED BY US HAVE BEEN SUBLET TO THIRD PARTIES. IN THE EVENT ANY OF THESE THIRD PARTIES VACATES ANY OF THESE PREMISES, WE WOULD BE LEGALLY OBLIGATED UNDER MASTER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FINANCIAL RISK OF DEFAULT BY SUCH SUBLESSEES IS INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE NOT MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.  COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN OUR  FISCAL 2017-2018 UPDATE 8-K  INCLUDE OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS. EXCEPT FOR CHANGES IN OUR SHORT-TERM DEBT AS DESCRIBED UNDER \u201cCAPITAL STRUCTURE AND RESOURCES\u201d IN THIS MD&A AND THE REPAYMENT AT MATURITY OF THE ENTIRE $300 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE FEBRUARY 27, 2019, NO MATERIAL CHANGES OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  IN OUR CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS TO REPAY DEBT, TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES, TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER OPERATING LEASES OR OUR COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS, OR IN OUR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ON OUTSTANDING SURETY BONDS, STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS AS DISCLOSED IN OUR  FISCAL 2017-2018 UPDATE 8-K.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, WE HAVE A CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO ISSUE 1.30 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR EACH SHARE OF L3 COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING AT CLOSING OF THE PENDING MERGER, AND WE EXPECT TO INCUR OTHER EXPENSES, SUCH AS TRANSACTION COSTS, OTHER PAYMENTS REQUIRED AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER AND INTEGRATION AND POST-CLOSING RESTRUCTURING COSTS. SEE  NOTE S \u2014 PENDING MERGER  IN THE NOTES FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, WE MAY HAVE OBLIGATIONS UNDER OTHER CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE ACCELERATED OR OTHERWISE IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER.  34  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, EXPENSES AND BACKLOG AS WELL AS DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY THE APPLICATION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES. EFFECTIVE JUNE 30, 2018, WE ADOPTED ASC 606, A NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD UNDER WHICH REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS CONTROL TRANSFERS TO THE CUSTOMER. THE GUIDANCE IN THIS STANDARD IS PRINCIPLES-BASED, AND, CONSEQUENTLY, ENTITIES ARE REQUIRED TO USE MORE JUDGMENT AND MAKE MORE ESTIMATES THAN UNDER PRIOR GUIDANCE, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, ESTIMATING VARIABLE CONSIDERATION TO INCLUDE IN THE CONTRACT PRICE AND ALLOCATING THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. UNDER ASC 606, REVENUE FOR OUR CONTRACTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED OVER TIME USING THE COST-TO-COST METHOD, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE REVENUE RECOGNITION MODEL WE USED FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR CONTRACTS PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD. IN MOST CASES, THE ACCOUNTING FOR CONTRACTS WHERE WE PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED REVENUE AS UNITS WERE DELIVERED HAS CHANGED UNDER ASC 606 SUCH THAT WE NOW RECOGNIZE REVENUE AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. IN ADDITION, FOR CERTAIN OF OUR CONTRACTS, THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS UNDER ASC 606, WHICH HAS ALTERED THE TIMING OF REVENUE AND MARGIN RECOGNITION. REFER TO NOTE 1 \u2014 \u201cSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d IN OUR NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  FISCAL 2017-2018 UPDATE 8-K  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR UPDATED REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES UPDATED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ADOPTION OF ASC 606, AS WELL AS FOR ALL OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE THAT REQUIRE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND MAY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES FOR US INCLUDE: (I) REVENUE RECOGNITION ON CONTRACTS AND CONTRACT ESTIMATES (DISCUSSED IN GREATER DETAIL IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS), (II) POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS, (III) PROVISIONS FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY LOSSES, (IV) IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL, AND (V) INCOME TAXES AND TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, SEE \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\u201d IN ITEM 7. \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d IN OUR  FISCAL 2017-2018 UPDATE 8-K.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS DERIVED FROM DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION CONTRACTS. REVENUE AND PROFIT RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME, TYPICALLY USING THE POC COST-TO-COST METHOD OF REVENUE RECOGNITION, WHEREBY WE MEASURE OUR PROGRESS TOWARD COMPLETION OF PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS BASED ON THE RATIO OF COSTS INCURRED TO DATE TO ESTIMATED COSTS AT COMPLETION UNDER THE CONTRACT. BECAUSE COSTS INCURRED REPRESENT WORK PERFORMED, WE BELIEVE THIS METHOD BEST DEPICTS THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO THE CUSTOMER. WE DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE FOR EACH CONTRACT BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE, AND THIS INCLUDES ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, SUCH AS AWARD AND INCENTIVE FEES. THESE VARIABLE AMOUNTS GENERALLY ARE AWARDED UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN NEGOTIATED PERFORMANCE METRICS, PROGRAM MILESTONES OR COST TARGETS AND CAN BE BASED UPON CUSTOMER DISCRETION. WE INCLUDE SUCH ESTIMATED AMOUNTS IN THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE EXTENT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL OF CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED WILL NOT OCCUR WHEN THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION IS RESOLVED.  UNDER THE POC COST-TO-COST METHOD OF REVENUE RECOGNITION, A SINGLE ESTIMATED PROFIT MARGIN IS USED TO RECOGNIZE PROFIT FOR EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION OVER ITS PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE. RECOGNITION OF PROFIT ON A CONTRACT REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL COST AT COMPLETION AND TRANSACTION PRICE AND THE MEASUREMENT OF PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION. DUE TO THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS, DEVELOPING THE ESTIMATED TOTAL COST AT COMPLETION AND TOTAL TRANSACTION PRICE OFTEN REQUIRES JUDGMENT. FACTORS THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING THE COST OF THE WORK TO BE COMPLETED INCLUDE: THE NATURE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE WORK TO BE PERFORMED, SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE AND THE RISK AND IMPACT OF DELAYED PERFORMANCE. FACTORS THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING THE TOTAL TRANSACTION PRICE INCLUDE CONTRACTUAL COST OR PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES (SUCH AS INCENTIVE FEES, AWARD FEES AND PENALTIES) AND OTHER FORMS OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION AS WELL AS OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATION FOR PERFORMANCE ON THE CONTRACT. AT THE OUTSET OF EACH CONTRACT, WE GAUGE ITS COMPLEXITY AND PERCEIVED RISKS AND ESTABLISH AN ESTIMATED TOTAL COST AT COMPLETION IN LINE WITH THESE EXPECTATIONS. AFTER ESTABLISHING THE ESTIMATED TOTAL COST AT COMPLETION, WE FOLLOW A STANDARD EAC PROCESS IN WHICH WE REVIEW THE PROGRESS AND PERFORMANCE ON OUR ONGOING CONTRACTS AT LEAST QUARTERLY AND, IN MANY CASES, MORE FREQUENTLY. IF WE SUCCESSFULLY RETIRE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TECHNICAL, SCHEDULE AND COST ASPECTS OF A CONTRACT, WE MAY LOWER OUR ESTIMATED TOTAL COST AT COMPLETION COMMENSURATE WITH THE RETIREMENT OF THESE RISKS. CONVERSELY, IF WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN RETIRING THESE RISKS, WE MAY INCREASE OUR ESTIMATED TOTAL COST AT COMPLETION. ADDITIONALLY, AS THE CONTRACT PROGRESSES, OUR ESTIMATES OF TOTAL TRANSACTION PRICE MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE IF, FOR EXAMPLE, WE RECEIVE AWARD FEES THAT ARE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN EXPECTED. WHEN ADJUSTMENTS IN ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS AT COMPLETION OR IN ESTIMATED TOTAL TRANSACTION PRICE ARE DETERMINED, THE RELATED IMPACT ON OPERATING INCOME IS RECOGNIZED USING THE CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP METHOD, WHICH RECOGNIZES IN THE CURRENT PERIOD THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS FOR ALL PRIOR PERIODS. ANY ANTICIPATED LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS ARE FULLY RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE LOSSES BECOME EVIDENT.  35  EAC ADJUSTMENTS HAD THE FOLLOWING IMPACTS TO OPERATING INCOME FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  QUARTER ENDED  THREE QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019  MARCH 30, 2018  MARCH 29, 2019  MARCH 30, 2018  (IN MILLIONS)  FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS  $32  $26  $100  $90  UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS  (26  )  (30  )  (95  )  (105  )  NET OPERATING INCOME ADJUSTMENTS  $6  $(4  )  $5  $(15  )  THIRD  QUARTER  2019  COMPARED WITH  THIRD  QUARTER  2018  .  THE NET FAVORABLE IMPACT TO OPERATING INCOME FROM EAC ADJUSTMENTS IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO THE NET UNFAVORABLE IMPACT TO OPERATING INCOME FROM EAC ADJUSTMENTS IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER COST EFFICIENCIES REALIZED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND THE CONCLUSION OF CERTAIN MISSION NETWORKS PROGRAMS THAT REALIZED COST GROWTH IN THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A  $12 MILLION  UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 FROM A REDUCTION IN ESTIMATED TRANSACTION PRICE FOR A FIXED-PRICE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT.  FIRST  THREE  QUARTERS  2019  COMPARED WITH FIRST  THREE  QUARTERS  2018  .  THE NET FAVORABLE IMPACT TO OPERATING INCOME FROM EAC ADJUSTMENTS IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO THE NET UNFAVORABLE IMPACT TO OPERATING INCOME FROM EAC ADJUSTMENTS IN THE FIRST  THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CONCLUSION OF CERTAIN MISSION NETWORKS PROGRAMS THAT REALIZED COST GROWTH IN FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A  $12 MILLION  UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  FROM A REDUCTION IN ESTIMATED TRANSACTION PRICE FOR A FIXED-PRICE INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT.  WE ALSO RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. FOR THESE CONTRACTS, WE ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BASED ON THE RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE OF THE GOOD OR SERVICE UNDERLYING EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. THE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT FOR WHICH WE WOULD SELL THE GOOD OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER ON A STANDALONE BASIS (I.E., NOT SOLD AS BUNDLED SALE WITH ANY OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES). THE ALLOCATION OF TRANSACTION PRICE AMONG SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS MAY IMPACT THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION BUT WILL NOT CHANGE THE TOTAL REVENUE RECOGNIZED ON THE CONTRACT. OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING FOREIGN MILITARY SALES CONTRACTS, ARE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS AND THE PRICES OF OUR CONTRACT DELIVERABLES ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON OUR ESTIMATED OR ACTUAL COSTS PLUS A REASONABLE PROFIT MARGIN. AS A RESULT, THE STANDALONE SELLING PRICES OF THE GOODS AND SERVICES IN THESE CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY EQUAL TO THE SELLING PRICES STATED IN THE CONTRACT, THEREBY ELIMINATING THE NEED TO ALLOCATE (OR REALLOCATE) THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. IN OUR NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, WE ALSO GENERALLY USE THE EXPECTED COST PLUS A MARGIN APPROACH TO DETERMINE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE. IN ADDITION, WE DETERMINE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE FOR CERTAIN CONTRACTS THAT ARE COMMERCIAL IN NATURE BASED ON OBSERVABLE SELLING PRICES. IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE MARGIN UNDER THE COST PLUS MARGIN APPROACH, WE CONSIDER HISTORICAL MARGINS ON SIMILAR PRODUCTS SOLD TO SIMILAR CUSTOMERS OR WITHIN SIMILAR GEOGRAPHIES WHERE OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE IS AVAILABLE. WE MAY ALSO CONSIDER OUR COST STRUCTURE AND PRICING OBJECTIVES, THE NATURE OF THE PROPOSAL, THE EFFECTS OF CUSTOMIZATION OF PRICING, OUR PRACTICES USED TO ESTABLISH PRICING OF BUNDLED PRODUCTS, THE EXPECTED TECHNOLOGICAL LIFE OF THE PRODUCT, MARGINS EARNED ON SIMILAR CONTRACTS WITH DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS AND OTHER FACTORS TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE MARGIN.

THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS WE BELIEVE COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR HISTORICAL RESULTS OR OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS.  \u2022  WE DEPEND ON U.S. GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE, AND THE LOSS OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS, A REDUCTION IN U.S. GOVERNMENT FUNDING OR A CHANGE IN U.S. GOVERNMENT SPENDING PRIORITIES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.  \u2022  WE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, WHICH OFTEN ARE ONLY PARTIALLY FUNDED, SUBJECT TO IMMEDIATE TERMINATION, AND HEAVILY REGULATED AND AUDITED. THE TERMINATION OR FAILURE TO FUND, OR NEGATIVE AUDIT FINDINGS FOR, ONE OR MORE OF THESE CONTRACTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.  \u2022  WE COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A SECURITY BREACH, THROUGH CYBER ATTACK, CYBER INTRUSION, INSIDER THREATS OR OTHERWISE, OR OTHER SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OF OUR IT NETWORKS AND RELATED SYSTEMS OR OF THOSE WE OPERATE FOR CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS.  \u2022  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\u2019S BUDGET DEFICIT, THE NATIONAL DEBT AND SEQUESTRATION, AS WELL AS ANY INABILITY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT TO COMPLETE ITS BUDGET PROCESS FOR ANY GOVERNMENT FISCAL YEAR AND CONSEQUENTLY HAVING TO OPERATE ON FUNDING LEVELS EQUIVALENT TO ITS PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PURSUANT TO A \u201cCONTINUING RESOLUTION\u201d OR SHUT DOWN, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.  \u2022  THE LEVEL OF RETURNS ON DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER FACTORS COULD AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  \u2022  WE ENTER INTO FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS THAT COULD SUBJECT US TO LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF COST OVERRUNS OR A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INFLATION.  \u2022  WE USE ESTIMATES IN ACCOUNTING FOR MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS, AND CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.  \u2022  WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  \u2022  OUR REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE IMPROPER CONDUCT OF OUR EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR BUSINESS PARTNERS.  \u2022  WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING THE NECESSARY EXPORT LICENSES TO CONDUCT CERTAIN OPERATIONS ABROAD, AND CONGRESS MAY PREVENT PROPOSED SALES TO CERTAIN FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.  \u2022  OUR FUTURE SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS, SYSTEMS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE IN OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE MARKETS.  \u2022  WE PARTICIPATE IN MARKETS THAT ARE OFTEN SUBJECT TO UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE GROWTH IN OUR MARKETS AND, AS A RESULT, FUTURE INCOME AND EXPENDITURES.  \u2022  WE CANNOT PREDICT THE CONSEQUENCES OF FUTURE GEO-POLITICAL EVENTS, BUT THEY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE, OUR ABILITY TO INSURE AGAINST RISKS, OUR OPERATIONS OR OUR PROFITABILITY.  \u2022  STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.  \u2022  DISPUTES WITH OUR SUBCONTRACTORS OR THE INABILITY OF OUR SUBCONTRACTORS TO PERFORM, OR OUR KEY SUPPLIERS TO TIMELY DELIVER OUR COMPONENTS, PARTS OR SERVICES, COULD CAUSE OUR PRODUCTS, SYSTEMS OR SERVICES TO BE PRODUCED OR DELIVERED IN AN UNTIMELY OR UNSATISFACTORY MANNER.  \u2022  THIRD PARTIES HAVE CLAIMED IN THE PAST AND MAY CLAIM IN THE FUTURE THAT WE ARE INFRINGING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY UPON THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND THIRD PARTIES MAY INFRINGE UPON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.  37  \u2022  THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION OR ARBITRATION IN WHICH WE ARE INVOLVED FROM TIME TO TIME IS UNPREDICTABLE, AND AN ADVERSE DECISION IN ANY SUCH MATTER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.  \u2022  WE FACE CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT RISK EXPOSURES AND POTENTIAL LIABILITIES THAT MAY NOT BE COVERED ADEQUATELY BY INSURANCE OR INDEMNITY.  \u2022  CHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u2022  OUR LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON OR SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND OUR UNFUNDED DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS LIABILITY MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL AND OPERATING ACTIVITIES OR OUR ABILITY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT.  \u2022  A DOWNGRADE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.  \u2022  UNFORESEEN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.  \u2022  WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN LOCATIONS THAT COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY IMPACTED IN THE EVENT OF A NATURAL DISASTER OR OTHER SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION.  \u2022  CHANGES IN FUTURE BUSINESS OR OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS COULD CAUSE BUSINESS INVESTMENTS AND/OR RECORDED GOODWILL OR OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS TO BECOME IMPAIRED, RESULTING IN SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES AND WRITE-DOWNS THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u2022  SOME OF OUR WORKFORCE IS REPRESENTED BY LABOR UNIONS, SO OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED IN THE EVENT OF A PROLONGED WORK STOPPAGE.  \u2022  WE MUST ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, AND ANY FAILURE TO DO SO COULD SERIOUSLY HARM US.

OVERVIEW  EARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC., A DELAWARE CORPORATION (\"EARTHSTONE\" AND TOGETHER WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, THE \"COMPANY,\" \"OUR,\" \"WE,\" \"US,\" OR SIMILAR TERMS), IS A GROWTH-ORIENTED INDEPENDENT OIL AND GAS COMPANY ENGAGED IN THE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OIL AND GAS RESERVES THROUGH ACTIVITIES THAT INCLUDE THE ACQUISITION, DRILLING AND DEVELOPMENT OF UNDEVELOPED LEASES, ASSET AND CORPORATE ACQUISITIONS AND MERGERS. OUR OPERATIONS ARE ALL IN THE UPSTREAM SEGMENT OF THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY AND ALL OUR PROPERTIES ARE ONSHORE IN THE UNITED STATES. AT PRESENT, OUR PRIMARY ASSETS ARE LOCATED IN THE MIDLAND BASIN OF WEST TEXAS AND THE EAGLE FORD TREND OF SOUTH TEXAS.  OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS CONCENTRATED IN THE MIDLAND BASIN OF WEST TEXAS WHERE OUR ACREAGE HAS MULTIPLE STACKED PAY INTERVALS IN THE WOLFCAMP AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE SPRABERRY FORMATIONS. WE BELIEVE THE MIDLAND BASIN AREA IS CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH OIL AND LIQUIDS-RICH NATURAL GAS CONTENT, MULTIPLE VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL TARGET HORIZONS AND HIGH DRILLING SUCCESS RATES.  EARTHSTONE IS THE SOLE MANAGING MEMBER OF EARTHSTONE ENERGY HOLDINGS, LLC, A DELAWARE LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY (TOGETHER WITH ITS WHOLLY-OWNED CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, \u201cEEH\u201d), WITH A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN EEH. EARTHSTONE, TOGETHER WITH ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, LYNDEN ENERGY CORP., A CORPORATION ORGANIZED UNDER THE LAWS OF BRITISH COLUMBIA (\u201cLYNDEN CORP\u201d), AND LYNDEN CORP\u2019S WHOLLY-OWNED CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY, LYNDEN USA INC., A UTAH CORPORATION (\u201cLYNDEN US\u201d) AND ALSO A MEMBER OF EEH, CONSOLIDATES THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF EEH AND RECORDS A NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPRESENTING THE ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF EEH'S MEMBERS OTHER THAN EARTHSTONE AND LYNDEN US.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLANS  OUR PLANS INCLUDE A CONTINUED FOCUS ON THE MIDLAND BASIN THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PROPERTIES AND BY FURTHER EXPANSION OF OUR ACREAGE FOOTPRINT AS AN OPERATOR. OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR 2019 PRESENTLY INCLUDES DRILLING APPROXIMATELY 16 OPERATED WELLS AND COMPLETING 13 OF THESE OPERATED WELLS.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ASSUMED PARTICIPATING IN DRILLING 20 WELLS AND COMPLETING 19 WELLS WHERE WE HAVE A NON-OPERATED WORKING INTEREST. AT OUR EAGLE FORD TREND PROPERTIES, OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM INCLUDES DRILLING APPROXIMATELY SEVEN OPERATED WELLS AND COMPLETING SEVEN WELLS. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THESE PLANS, WE HAVE AN APPROVED ANNUAL BUDGET OF $190.0 MILLION. COMMODITY PRICES CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE AND WE INTEND TO BE VIGILANT TO ADJUST OUR BUSINESS PLANS ACCORDINGLY.  IN ADDITION TO OUR CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM FOR 2019, OUR PLANS ALSO INCLUDE AN ACREAGE EXPANSION PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE CAN TRADE ACREAGE WITH OTHER OPERATORS OR BOLT ON ACREAGE THROUGH ACQUISITIONS. OUR INTENT IS TO INCREASE OUR OVERALL OPERATED LOCATIONS AND ALLOW US TO DEVELOP OUR ACREAGE WITH LONG HORIZONTAL LATERALS (7,500 TO 12,000+ FOOT LATERAL LENGTHS). WE WILL ALSO REMAIN ACTIVE IN SEEKING M&A TRANSACTIONS IN THIS HIGH ECONOMIC RETURN GEOGRAPHIC AREA.  AREAS OF OPERATION  OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS CONCENTRATED IN THE MIDLAND BASIN OF WEST TEXAS, A HIGH OIL AND LIQUIDS RICH RESOURCE WHICH PROVIDES US WITH MULTIPLE HORIZONTAL TARGETS WITH PROVEN PRODUCTION RESULTS, LONG-LIVED RESERVES AND HISTORICALLY HIGH DRILLING SUCCESS RATES.  MIDLAND BASIN  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE COMPLETED SIX WELLS (THREE OPERATED AND THREE NON-OPERATED) AND SPUD AN ADDITIONAL 12 WELLS (THREE OPERATED AND NINE NON-OPERATED) DURING THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF 2019. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO COMPLETE APPROXIMATELY 10 OPERATED WELLS OVER THE LATTER HALF OF 2019. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO INITIATE COMPLETION ACTIVITIES WHEN WE ACCUMULATE AN ADEQUATE INVENTORY OF WELLS FOR EFFICIENT OPERATIONS.  COMMENCING IN EARLY 2018, MARKET CONCERNS ABOUT FUTURE TAKE-AWAY CAPACITY ADVERSELY AFFECTED OIL AND GAS PRICE DIFFERENTIALS IN THE MIDLAND BASIN. SINCE THEN, THE MARKET CONCERNS HAVE BEEN ABATED AS ADDITIONAL OIL PIPELINES HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE TAKE-AWAY INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE AREA.  CONSEQUENTLY, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THESE NEGATIVE OIL PRICE DIFFERENTIALS.   NATURAL GAS PRICE DIFFERENTIALS CONTINUE TO GROW AS FUTURE TAKE-AWAY CAPACITY IN THE AREA IS BEING CHALLENGED. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL GAS PIPELINES EXPECTED TO COME ON LINE ON OR ABOUT THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019.  WHILE WE BELIEVE THE ECONOMIC RETURNS FROM OUR OPERATIONS ARE VERY ATTRACTIVE AT CURRENT PRICE LEVELS AND OUR WELLS ARE MEETING OR EXCEEDING OUR TYPE CURVES, OUR CASHFLOWS ARE BEING IMPACTED BY NEGATIVE DIFFERENTIALS, (EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF DERIVATIVES). INCREASING AND SUSTAINED NEGATIVE OIL AND GAS PRICE DIFFERENTIALS WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND COULD CAUSE US TO REDUCE THE PACE OF DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PROPERTIES.  EAGLE FORD TREND  IN OUR OPERATED LEASEHOLD ACREAGE LOCATED IN THE EAGLE FORD TREND, WE HAVE COMMENCED DRILLING OPERATIONS AND EXPECT TO COMPLETE THE SEVEN WELL PROGRAM BY THE END OF 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d) REQUIRES US TO USE OUR JUDGMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT CERTAIN AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND THUS IMPACT AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FUTURE. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT INVOLVE JUDGMENT AND UNCERTAINTIES AFFECTING THE APPLICATION OF THOSE POLICIES AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS WOULD BE REPORTED UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OR USING DIFFERING ASSUMPTIONS.

LYNDEN CORP INCURRED NO MATERIAL INCOME OR LOSS, OR RELATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT UNDEVELOPED ACREAGE AND FUTURE DRILLING LOCATIONS. DRILLING HORIZONTAL WELLS, GENERALLY CONSISTING OF 7,500 TO 12,000-FOOT LATERAL LENGTHS, IN THE MIDLAND BASIN IS CAPITAL INTENSIVE. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  $0.4 MILLION  IN CASH AND APPROXIMATELY  $154 MILLION  IN UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE EEH CREDIT AGREEMENT (DISCUSSED BELOW) AVAILABLE FOR OPERATIONAL AND CAPITAL FUNDING. WE CURRENTLY ESTIMATE 2019 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $190 MILLION, OF WHICH $48.5 MILLION HAS BEEN SPENT THROUGH MARCH 31, 2019. OUR 2019 CAPITAL PROGRAM ASSUMES A 16-WELL PROGRAM RUNNING ONE RIG FOR OUR OPERATED ACREAGE IN THE MIDLAND BASIN AND A SEVEN-WELL PROGRAM FOR OUR OPERATED EAGLE FORD ACREAGE AS WELL AS ESTIMATED EXPENDITURES FOR OUR NON-OPERATED MIDLAND BASIN PROPERTIES AND LAND AND INFRASTRUCTURE ACTIVITIES. WE LIKELY WILL CONTINUE TO OUTSPEND OUR CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OVER AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF THIS REPORT BASED ON CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE WE WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY WITH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS UNDER THE EEH CREDIT AGREEMENT FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS IN ORDER TO MEET OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS. WE MAY CONSIDER VARIOUS FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER TECHNIQUES OR TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROMOTED DRILLING ARRANGEMENTS.  WORKING CAPITAL, DEFINED HEREIN AS TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS LESS TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES AS SET FORTH IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, WAS A DEFICIT OF  $28.8 MILLION  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO A DEFICIT OF  $18.3 MILLION  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . OUR COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN TIMELY AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT.  THE INCREASE IN THE DEFICIT IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A NET DECREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS EXPECTED TO SETTLE OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED RECEIVABLES AND DECREASED PAYABLES.  WE EXPECT THAT CHANGES IN RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES RELATED TO OUR PACE OF DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION VOLUMES, CHANGES IN OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES, REALIZED COMMODITY PRICES AND DIFFERENTIALS TO NYMEX PRICES FOR OUR OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE LARGEST VARIABLES AFFECTING OUR WORKING CAPITAL.  WE EXPECT TO FINANCE FUTURE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES WITH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, BORROWINGS UNDER THE EEH CREDIT AGREEMENT AND, VARIOUS MEANS OF CORPORATE AND PROJECT FINANCING, ASSUMING WE CAN EFFECTIVELY ACCESS DEBT AND EQUITY MARKETS. IN ADDITION, AS INDICATED ABOVE, WE MAY CONTINUE TO PARTIALLY FINANCE OUR DRILLING ACTIVITIES THROUGH THE SALE OF PARTICIPATING RIGHTS TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS, AND WE COULD STRUCTURE SUCH ARRANGEMENTS ON A PROMOTED BASIS, WHEREBY WE MAY EARN WORKING INTERESTS IN RESERVES AND PRODUCTION GREATER THAN OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF CAPITAL COSTS.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  WERE  $7.1 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $16.8 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO USE OF CASH FROM CHANGES IN PAYABLES AND RECEIVABLES RELATED TO OUR OPERATION OF OUR OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SOURCES OF CASH FROM CHANGES IN CASH SETTLEMENTS OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE  $48.5 MILLION  AND  $33.2  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED DRILLING AND COMPLETION ACTIVITY AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE  $41.5 MILLION  AND  $4.5 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET BORROWINGS UNDER THE EEH CREDIT AGREEMENT IN THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER WHICH WERE USED TO FUND OUR DRILLING AND COMPLETION ACTIVITIES.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  OUR 2019 CAPITAL BUDGET ASSUMES A ONE-RIG OPERATED PROGRAM AND NON-OPERATED ACTIVITIES AS CURRENTLY PROPOSED BY OPERATORS, FOR OUR ACREAGE IN THE MIDLAND BASIN AS WELL AS A SEVEN-WELL PROGRAM ON OUR OPERATED EAGLE FORD ACREAGE. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR 2019 ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY $190.0 MILLION, OF WHICH WE SPENT  $48.5 MILLION  ON A CASH BASIS AND INCURRED  $42.7 MILLION  ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 (THE DIFFERENCE OF $5.8 MILLION REPRESENTING A DECREASE IN ACCRUED BUT UNPAID CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FROM DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO MARCH 31, 2019).

SPECIFICALLY, WE HAVE FOCUSED ON NET INTEREST INCOME THROUGH A VARIETY OF PROCESSES, INCLUDING INCREASES IN AVERAGE INTEREST EARNING ASSETS, AND MINIMIZING THE EFFECTS OF THE CONTINUING DECLINES IN INTEREST RATES ON OUR NET INTEREST MARGIN.  THE COMPANY\u2019S NET INTEREST MARGIN (FULLY TAX EQUIVALENT BASIS)  INCREASE  D TO  4.63%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  4.31%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .

THE COMPANY HAD  NO  OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED (OREO) OR REPOSSESSED ASSETS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  OR  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  MANAGEMENT MAINTAINS CERTAIN LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT CURRENT BY THE BORROWER (LESS THAN 30 DAYS DELINQUENT) ON NONACCRUAL STATUS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE LOANS ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN CURRENT IN FUTURE PERIODS.  THE RATIO OF NONPERFORMING LOANS TO TOTAL LOANS WAS  0.17%  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  0.30%  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCE WAS  0.99%  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  0.99%  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE RATIO OF NET CHARGE-OFF (RECOVERY) TO AVERAGE LOANS WAS  (0.02)%  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  (0.03)%  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  ASSET GROWTH  AS REVENUES FROM BOTH NET INTEREST INCOME AND NON-INTEREST INCOME ARE A FUNCTION OF ASSET SIZE, THE GROWTH IN ASSETS HAS A DIRECT IMPACT IN INCREASING NET INCOME AND THEREFORE ROE AND ROA.  THE MAJORITY OF OUR ASSETS ARE LOANS AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES, AND  THE MAJORITY OF OUR LIABILITIES ARE DEPOSITS, AND THEREFORE THE ABILITY TO GENERATE DEPOSITS AS A FUNDING SOURCE FOR LOANS AND INVESTMENTS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR ASSET GROWTH.  TOTAL ASSETS  INCREASE  D BY  $26,401,000  OR  1.72%  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  TO  $1,564,237,000  COMPARED TO  $1,537,836,000  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF LOANS AND DEPOSITS IS BELOW.  CAPITAL ADEQUACY  CAPITAL SERVES AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS AND HELPS PROTECT DEPOSITORS AND SHAREHOLDERS AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES.  THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY MAINTAINED SUBSTANTIAL LEVELS OF CAPITAL.  THE ASSESSMENT OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY IS DEPENDENT ON SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING ASSET QUALITY, EARNINGS TRENDS, LIQUIDITY AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  MAINTENANCE OF ADEQUATE CAPITAL LEVELS IS INTEGRAL TO PROVIDING STABILITY TO THE COMPANY.  THE COMPANY NEEDS TO MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIAL LEVELS OF REGULATORY CAPITAL TO GIVE IT FLEXIBILITY IN THE CHANGING REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDING ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES.  THE COMPANY AND THE BANK ARE EACH SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ADMINISTERED BY FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES.  FAILURE TO MEET MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MAY CAUSE CERTAIN MANDATORY AND DISCRETIONARY ACTIONS BY REGULATORS THAT, IF UNDERTAKEN, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  UNDER CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES AND THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION, THE COMPANY AND THE BANK MUST MEET SPECIFIC CAPITAL GUIDELINES THAT INVOLVE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE MEASURES.  THESE MEASURES WERE ESTABLISHED BY BANK REGULATORY AGENCIES TO ENSURE CAPITAL ADEQUACY.  AS OF AUGUST 30, 2018, BANK HOLDING COMPANIES WITH CONSOLIDATED ASSETS OF LESS THAN $3 BILLION AND BANKS LIKE CENTRAL VALLEY COMMUNITY BANK BECAME SUBJECT TO NEW CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE NEW RULES ARE BEING PHASED IN THROUGH 2019 UNDER THE DODD-FRANK ACT AND BASEL III.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE BANK MET OR EXCEEDED ALL OF THEIR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS INCLUSIVE OF THE CAPITAL BUFFER.  THE BANK\u2019S CAPITAL RATIOS EXCEEDED THE REGULATORY GUIDELINES FOR A WELL-CAPITALIZED FINANCIAL INSTITUTION UNDER THE BASEL III REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  .  THE COMPANY\u2019S REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS ARE PRESENTED IN THE TABLE IN THE  \u201cCAPITAL\u201d  SECTION BELOW.  OPERATING EFFICIENCY  OPERATING EFFICIENCY IS THE MEASURE OF HOW EFFICIENTLY EARNINGS BEFORE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND TAXES ARE GENERATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE.  WHEN MEASURING OPERATING EFFICIENCY, A LOWER RATIO IS MORE FAVORABLE.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFICIENCY RATIO (OPERATING EXPENSES, EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AND FORECLOSED PROPERTY EXPENSE, DIVIDED BY NET INTEREST INCOME BEFORE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES (COMPUTED ON A TAX EQUIVALENT BASIS) PLUS NON-INTEREST INCOME, EXCLUDING GAINS AND LOSSES FROM SALES OF SECURITIES AND OREO, AND GAINS RELATED TO THE COLLECTION OF LIFE INSURANCE PROCEEDS) WAS  63.92%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  62.59%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE EFFICIENCY RATIO IS DUE TO THE GROWTH IN NON-INTEREST EXPENSE OUTPACING THE GROWTH IN NON-INTEREST INCOME.  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE CHANGE IN NET INTEREST INCOME AND  INCREASE  IN OPERATING EXPENSES IS BELOW.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY\u2019S NET INTEREST INCOME BEFORE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON A NON TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS PLUS NON-INTEREST INCOME, NET OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES RELATED GAINS, LESS GAIN ON SALE OF CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO, AND GAIN RELATED TO THE COLLECTION OF LIFE INSURANCE PROCEEDS,  INCREASE  D  1.38%  TO  $17,909,000  FOR THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $17,666,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , WHILE OPERATING EXPENSES, NET OF LOSSES ON SALE OF ASSETS, ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION COSTS, AND AMORTIZATION OF CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES,  INCREASE  D  3.53%  TO  $11,448,000  FROM  $11,058,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  LIQUIDITY  LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT INVOLVES THE BANK\u2019S ABILITY TO MEET CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS ARISING FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN DEPOSIT LEVELS AND DEMANDS OF DAILY OPERATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE PROVIDING FOR CUSTOMERS\u2019 CREDIT NEEDS, FUNDING OF SECURITIES PURCHASES, AND ONGOING REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS.  OUR LIQUIDITY IS ACTIVELY MANAGED ON A DAILY BASIS AND REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY OUR MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS\u2019 ASSET/LIABILITY COMMITTEE.  THIS PROCESS IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THE MAINTENANCE OF SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR FUNDING NEEDS, INCLUDING ADEQUATE CASH FLOW FOR OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE DERIVED FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES WHICH INCLUDE THE ACCEPTANCE OF CUSTOMER AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, BROKER DEPOSITS, FEDERAL FUNDS FACILITIES AND ADVANCES FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO (FHLB).  WE HAVE AVAILABLE UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT WITH CORRESPONDENT BANKS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  $40,000,000  AND SECURED BORROWING LINES OF APPROXIMATELY  $287,839,000  WITH THE FHLB.  THESE FUNDING SOURCES ARE AUGMENTED BY COLLECTION OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON LOANS, THE ROUTINE MATURITIES AND PAY DOWNS OF SECURITIES FROM OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, THE STABILITY OF OUR CORE DEPOSITS, AND THE ABILITY TO SELL INVESTMENT SECURITIES.  PRIMARY USES OF FUNDS INCLUDE ORIGINATION AND PURCHASES OF LOANS, WITHDRAWALS OF AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON DEPOSITS, PURCHASES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, AND PAYMENT OF OPERATING EXPENSES.  WE HAD LIQUID ASSETS (CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS, INTEREST-EARNING DEPOSITS IN OTHER BANKS, FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, AND EQUITY SECURITIES) TOTALING  $519,203,000  OR  33.19%  OF TOTAL ASSETS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  $502,886,000  OR  32.70%  OF TOTAL ASSETS AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018.

BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR  MARCH 31, 2019  WERE  $0.38  AND  $0.38  , RESPECTIVELY.  BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  WERE  $0.39  AND  $0.38  , RESPECTIVELY.  ANNUALIZED ROE WAS  9.42%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  10.15%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  ANNUALIZED ROA FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  WAS  1.35%  AND  1.30%  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE  DECREASE  IN NET INCOME FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY  AN  INCREASE  IN  NON-INTEREST EXPENSE AND AN  INCREASE  IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN  INCREASE  IN NET INTEREST INCOME AND AN  INCREASE  IN NET REALIZED GAINS ON SALES AND CALLS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY RECORDED A  $25,000  REVERSAL OF THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, COMPARED TO A  NO  PROVISION DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE  NET INTEREST INCOME IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OUR INCOME FROM OPERATIONS.  NET INTEREST INCOME (THE \u201cINTEREST RATE SPREAD\u201d) IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROSS INTEREST AND FEES EARNED ON THE LOAN AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS AND THE INTEREST PAID ON DEPOSITS AND OTHER BORROWINGS.  NET INTEREST INCOME DEPENDS ON THE VOLUME OF AND INTEREST RATE EARNED ON INTEREST EARNING ASSETS AND THE VOLUME OF AND INTEREST RATE PAID ON INTEREST BEARING LIABILITIES.

THE REMAINING BALANCE OF ACCRETABLE LOAN MARKS ON ACQUIRED LOANS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  $4,646,000.  INTEREST INCOME FROM TOTAL INVESTMENTS ON A NON TAX-EQUIVALENT BASIS (TOTAL INVESTMENTS INCLUDE INVESTMENT SECURITIES, FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD, INTEREST BEARING DEPOSITS WITH OTHER BANKS, AND OTHER SECURITIES)  INCREASE  D  $11,000  IN THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  TO  $3,735,000  COMPARED TO  $3,724,000  , FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .

AVERAGE TOTAL SECURITIES AND INTEREST-EARNING DEPOSITS FOR THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  DECREASE  D  $81,956,000  OR  14.19%  TO  $495,805,000  COMPARED TO  $577,761,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS REPRESENTS  23.59%  OF NET INTEREST INCOME FOR THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO  24.14%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE YIELDS, WITHOUT ACCEPTING UNREASONABLE RISK, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INVESTMENT PURCHASES HAVE BEEN IN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MBS) AND COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (CMOS).  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HELD  $349,730,000  OR  72.92%  OF THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IN MBS AND CMOS WITH AN AVERAGE YIELD OF  3.18%  AS COMPARED TO  $361,080,000  AND  $294,304,000  WITH AVERAGE YIELDS OF  2.81%  AND  2.63%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  WE INVEST IN CMOS AND MBS AS PART OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY TO INCREASE OUR NET INTEREST MARGIN.  CMOS AND MBS BY THEIR NATURE REACT TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES.  IN A NORMAL DECLINING RATE ENVIRONMENT, PREPAYMENTS FROM MBS AND CMOS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO INCREASE AND THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT WOULD BE EXPECTED TO SHORTEN.  CONVERSELY, IF INTEREST RATES INCREASE, PREPAYMENTS NORMALLY WOULD BE EXPECTED TO DECLINE AND THE AVERAGE LIFE OF THE MBS AND CMOS WOULD BE EXPECTED TO EXTEND.  HOWEVER, IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, PREPAYMENTS MAY NOT BEHAVE ACCORDING TO HISTORICAL NORMS.  PREMIUM AMORTIZATION AND DISCOUNT ACCRETION OF THESE INVESTMENTS AFFECTS OUR NET INTEREST INCOME.  MANAGEMENT MONITORS THE PREPAYMENT SPEED OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND ADJUSTS PREMIUM AMORTIZATION AND DISCOUNT ACCRETION BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS.  THESE FACTORS INCLUDE THE TYPE OF INVESTMENT, THE INVESTMENT STRUCTURE, INTEREST RATES, INTEREST RATES ON NEW MORTGAGE LOANS, EXPECTATION OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE LEVEL OF PRINCIPAL REMAINING ON THE BOND, THE BOND COUPON RATE, THE BOND ORIGINATION DATE, AND VOLUME OF AVAILABLE BONDS IN MARKET.  THE CALCULATION OF PREMIUM AMORTIZATION AND DISCOUNT ACCRETION REPRESENTS MANAGEMENT\u2019S REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF PRINCIPAL PAY DOWNS INHERENT IN THE TOTAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE NET-OF-TAX UNREALIZED  GAIN  ON THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WAS  $922,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND IS REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S EQUITY.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE AVERAGE LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WAS  3.31  YEARS AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO REFLECTED A NET PRE-TAX UNREALIZED  GAIN  OF  $1,309,000  .  MANAGEMENT REVIEWS FAIR VALUE DECLINES ON INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT SECURITIES TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY REPRESENT AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT (OTTI).  REFER TO  NOTE 3  OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR MORE DETAIL.  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018  , NO OTTI WAS RECORDED.  ADDITIONAL DETERIORATION IN THE MARKET VALUES OF OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES, IF ANY, MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO RECOGNIZE OTTI LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.  A COMPONENT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S STRATEGIC PLAN HAS BEEN TO USE ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO OFFSET, IN PART, ITS INTEREST RATE RISK RELATING TO VARIABLE RATE LOANS.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE ESTIMATE AN IMMEDIATE RATE INCREASE OF 200 BASIS POINTS WOULD RESULT IN AN ESTIMATED DECREASE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO BY APPROXIMATELY  $34,000,000  OR  7.33%  .  CONVERSELY, WITH AN IMMEDIATE RATE DECREASE OF 200 BASIS POINTS, THE ESTIMATED INCREASE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WOULD BE  $16,000,000  OR  3.45%  .  OUR MODELING ENVIRONMENT ASSUMES MANAGEMENT WOULD TAKE NO ACTION DURING AN IMMEDIATE SHOCK OF 200 BASIS POINTS.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY USES THOSE INCREMENTS TO MEASURE ITS INTEREST RATE RISK IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND RISK TOLERANCE POLICY LIMITS ESTABLISHED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO MEASURE THE POSSIBLE FUTURE RISK IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S REVIEW OF ALL INVESTMENTS BEFORE PURCHASE INCLUDES AN ANALYSIS OF HOW THE SECURITY WILL PERFORM UNDER SEVERAL INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS TO MONITOR WHETHER INVESTMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR INVESTMENT POLICY.  THE POLICY ADDRESSES ISSUES OF AVERAGE LIFE, DURATION, CONCENTRATION GUIDELINES, PROHIBITED INVESTMENTS, IMPAIRMENT, AND PROHIBITED PRACTICES.  TOTAL INTEREST INCOME ON A NON-TAX EQUIVALENT BASIS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  INCREASE  D  $559,000  OR  3.55%  TO  $16,289,000  COMPARED TO  $15,730,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  WE PROVIDE FOR PROBABLE INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES THROUGH A CHARGE TO OPERATING INCOME BASED UPON THE COMPOSITION OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO, DELINQUENCY LEVELS, HISTORICAL LOSSES, AND NONPERFORMING ASSETS, ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS WHICH, IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT, DESERVE RECOGNITION IN ESTIMATING CREDIT LOSSES.  LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF WHEN THEY ARE CONSIDERED UNCOLLECTIBLE OR WHEN CONTINUANCE AS AN ACTIVE EARNING BANK ASSET IS NOT WARRANTED.  THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ADEQUATE CREDIT ALLOWANCE IS BASED ON BOTH AN ACCURATE RISK RATING SYSTEM AND LOAN PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT TOOLS.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAVE ESTABLISHED INITIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY OF CREDIT RISK GRADES WITH THE INDIVIDUAL CREDIT OFFICER.  THE CREDIT REVIEW OFFICER (CRO) WILL REVIEW LOANS TO ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF THE RISK GRADE AND IS EMPOWERED TO CHANGE ANY RISK GRADE, AS APPROPRIATE.  THE CRO IS NOT INVOLVED IN LOAN ORIGINATIONS.  QUARTERLY, THE CREDIT OFFICERS MUST CERTIFY THE CURRENT RISK GRADE OF THE LOANS IN THEIR PORTFOLIO.  THE CRO REVIEWS THE CERTIFICATIONS.  AT LEAST QUARTERLY THE CRO REPORTS HIS ACTIVITIES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUDIT COMMITTEE; AND AT LEAST ANNUALLY THE LOAN PORTFOLIO IS REVIEWED BY A THIRD PARTY CREDIT REVIEWER AND BY VARIOUS REGULATORY AGENCIES.  QUARTERLY, THE CHIEF CREDIT OFFICER (CCO) SETS THE SPECIFIC RESERVE FOR ALL IMPAIRED CREDITS.  ADDITIONALLY, THE CCO IS RESPONSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT THE GENERAL RESERVES ON NON-IMPAIRED LOANS ARE PROPERLY SET EACH QUARTER.  THIS PROCESS INCLUDES THE UTILIZATION OF LOAN DELINQUENCY REPORTS, CLASSIFIED ASSET REPORTS, COLLATERAL ANALYSIS AND PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION REPORTS TO ASSIST IN ACCURATELY ASSESSING CREDIT RISK AND ESTABLISHING APPROPRIATE RESERVES.  THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED AT LEAST QUARTERLY BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUDIT COMMITTEE AND BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  GENERAL RESERVES ARE ALLOCATED TO LOAN PORTFOLIO CATEGORIES USING PERCENTAGES WHICH ARE BASED ON BOTH HISTORICAL RISK ELEMENTS SUCH AS DELINQUENCIES AND LOSSES AND PREDICTIVE RISK ELEMENTS SUCH AS ECONOMIC, COMPETITIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS.  WE HAVE ADOPTED THE SPECIFIC RESERVE APPROACH TO ALLOCATE RESERVES TO EACH IMPAIRED CREDIT FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTIMATING POTENTIAL LOSS EXPOSURE.  ALTHOUGH THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS PORTFOLIO CATEGORIES, IT IS GENERAL IN NATURE AND AVAILABLE FOR THE LOAN PORTFOLIO IN ITS ENTIRETY.  CHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES MAY BE REQUIRED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF INDEPENDENT LOAN PORTFOLIO EXAMINATIONS, REGULATORY AGENCY EXAMINATIONS, OR OUR OWN INTERNAL REVIEW PROCESS.  ADDITIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED WHEN, IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT, THE ALLOWANCE DOES NOT PROPERLY REFLECT THE PORTFOLIO\u2019S PROBABLE LOSS EXPOSURE.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ALL ADJUSTMENTS, IF ANY, TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ARE SUPPORTED BY THE TIMELY AND CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF METHODOLOGIES AND PROCESSES RESULTING IN DETAILED DOCUMENTATION OF THE ALLOWANCE CALCULATION AND OTHER PORTFOLIO TRENDING ANALYSIS.  THE ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS SET FORTH BELOW (IN THOUSANDS).  LOAN TYPE  MARCH 31, 2019  DECEMBER 31, 2018  COMMERCIAL.

IT IS THE POLICY OF MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ADDITIONS TO THE ALLOWANCE SO THAT IT REMAINS ADEQUATE TO COVER ALL PROBABLE INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES THAT EXIST IN THE PORTFOLIO AT THAT TIME.  WE ASSIGN QUALITATIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS (Q FACTORS) TO EACH LOAN CATEGORY.  Q FACTORS INCLUDE  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESERVES HELD FOR THE EFFECTS OF LENDING POLICIES, ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND PORTFOLIO TRENDS ALONG WITH OTHER DYNAMICS WHICH MAY CAUSE ADDITIONAL STRESS TO THE PORTFOLIO.  MANAGING HIGH-RISK CREDITS INCLUDES DEVELOPING A BUSINESS STRATEGY WITH THE CUSTOMER TO MITIGATE OUR POTENTIAL LOSSES.  MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO MONITOR THESE CREDITS WITH A VIEW TO IDENTIFYING AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE WHEN, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS MAY BE NECESSARY.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE LEVEL OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES ALLOCATED TO COMMERCIAL AND REAL ESTATE LOANS HAS BEEN ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY RECORDED A  $25,000  REVERSE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, COMPARED TO  NO  PROVISION DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THE REVERSE PROVISION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RESULTED FROM OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE OVERALL ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES CONSIDERING A NUMBER OF FACTORS AS DISCUSSED IN THE \u201cALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\u201d SECTION.  THE COMPANY HAD NET RECOVERIES TOTALING  $39,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ,AND  $10,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  NONPERFORMING LOANS, CONSISTING ENTIRELY OF NONACCRUAL LOANS, WERE  $1,548,000  AND  $2,740,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  $4,058,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2018  .  NONPERFORMING LOANS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LOANS WERE  0.17%  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  0.30%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  0.44%  AT  MARCH 31, 2018  .   THE COMPANY HAD  NO  OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED (OREO) AT  MARCH 31, 2019  OR  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE COMPANY HELD  NO  REPOSSESSED ASSETS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  OR  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THE ANNUALIZED NET CHARGE-OFF (RECOVERY) RATIO, WHICH REFLECTS NET CHARGE-OFFS (RECOVERIES) TO AVERAGE LOANS WAS  (0.02)%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , AND  0.00%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  ECONOMIC PRESSURES MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF BORROWERS TO WHOM THE COMPANY HAS EXTENDED CREDIT AND AS A RESULT WHEN NEGATIVE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE ANTICIPATED, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROVISIONS TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES.  THE BANK CONDUCTS BANKING OPERATION PRINCIPALLY IN CALIFORNIA\u2019S CENTRAL VALLEY.  THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON AGRICULTURE.  THE AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, RESULTS OF OPERATION AND CASH FLOWS.  WE ARE ALSO DEPENDENT IN A LARGE PART UPON THE BUSINESS ACTIVITY, POPULATION GROWTH, INCOME LEVELS AND REAL ESTATE ACTIVITY IN THIS MARKET AREA.  A DOWNTURN IN AGRICULTURE AND THE AGRICULTURAL RELATED BUSINESSES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY DECLINES IN PRICES AND THE RATES OF PRICE GROWTH FOR VARIOUS CROPS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES.  SIMILARLY, WEAKER PRICES COULD REDUCE THE CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY FARMS AND THE VALUE OF AGRICULTURAL LAND IN OUR LOCAL MARKETS AND THEREBY INCREASE THE RISK OF DEFAULT BY OUR BORROWERS OR REDUCE THE FORECLOSURE VALUE OF AGRICULTURAL LAND AND EQUIPMENT THAT SERVE AS COLLATERAL OF OUR LOANS.  FURTHER DECLINES IN COMMODITY PRICES OR COLLATERAL VALUES MAY INCREASE THE INCIDENCE OF DEFAULT BY OUR BORROWERS.  MOREOVER, WEAKER PRICES MIGHT THREATEN FARMING OPERATIONS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY, REDUCING MARKET DEMAND FOR AGRICULTURAL LENDING.  IN PARTICULAR, FARM INCOME HAS SEEN RECENT DECLINES, AND IN LINE WITH THE DOWNTURN IN FARM INCOME, FARMLAND PRICES ARE COMING UNDER PRESSURE.  WE HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROACTIVE IN LOOKING FOR SIGNS OF DETERIORATION WITHIN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO IN AN EFFORT TO MANAGE CREDIT QUALITY AND WORK WITH BORROWERS WHERE POSSIBLE TO MITIGATE LOSSES.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THERE WERE  $16.8 MILLION  IN CLASSIFIED LOANS OF WHICH  $6.5 MILLION  RELATED TO AGRICULTURAL REAL ESTATE,  $2.2 MILLION  TO COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS,  $1.7 MILLION  TO REAL ESTATE OWNER OCCUPIED,  $1.1 MILLION  IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE,  $1.6 MILLION  TO REAL ESTATE CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER LAND LOANS, AND  $2.9 MILLION  TO CONSUMER EQUITY LOANS AND LINES OF CREDIT.  THIS COMPARES TO  $28.4 MILLION  IN CLASSIFIED LOANS OF WHICH  $19.2 MILLION  RELATED TO AGRICULTURAL REAL ESTATE,  $2.6 MILLION  TO COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS,  $0.9 MILLION  TO REAL ESTATE OWNER OCCUPIED,  $1.1 MILLION  TO COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE,  $1.6 MILLION  TO CONSUMER EQUITY AND LINES OF CREDIT, AND  $3.0 MILLION  TO REAL ESTATE CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER LAND LOANS AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE BELIEVE, BASED ON ALL CURRENT AND AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS ADEQUATE TO ABSORB PROBABLE INCURRED LOSSES WITHIN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO.  HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT WE MAY NOT SUSTAIN CHARGE-OFFS WHICH ARE IN EXCESS OF THE ALLOWANCE IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD.  REFER TO THE \u201cALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\u201d SECTION FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  NET INTEREST INCOME AFTER PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  NET INTEREST INCOME, AFTER THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, WAS  $15,860,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  $15,426,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  NON-INTEREST INCOME  NON-INTEREST INCOME IS COMPRISED OF CUSTOMER SERVICE CHARGES, LOAN PLACEMENT FEES, NET GAINS ON SALES AND CALLS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, APPRECIATION IN CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF BANK-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE, FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK DIVIDENDS, AND OTHER INCOME.  NON-INTEREST INCOME WAS  $2,976,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  $2,771,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THE  $205,000  OR  7.40%  INCREASE  IN NON-INTEREST INCOME DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN  INCREASE  OF  $237,000  IN NET REALIZED GAINS ON SALES AND CALLS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, OFFSET BY A  $65,000  DECREASE  IN SERVICE CHARGE INCOME AND A  DECREASE  IN LOAN PLACEMENT FEES OF  $27,000.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE REALIZED A NET GAIN ON SALES AND CALLS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES OF  $1,052,000  COMPARED TO  $815,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THE NET GAINS REALIZED ON SALES AND CALLS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES IN  2019  AND  2018  WERE THE RESULT OF A PARTIAL RESTRUCTURING OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO.  CUSTOMER SERVICE CHARGES  DECREASE  D  $65,000  OR  8.61%  TO  $690,000  FOR THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $755,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  INTERCHANGE FEES  DECREASE  D  $2,000  TO  $343,000  THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $345,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  LOAN PLACEMENT FEES  DECREASE  D  $27,000  OR  16.27%  TO  $139,000  FOR THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $166,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  OTHER INCOME  INCREASE  D  $62,000  THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  THE BANK HOLDS STOCK FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR BORROWING CAPACITY AND GENERALLY EARNS QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS.  WE CURRENTLY HOLD  $6,843,000  IN FHLB STOCK.  WE RECEIVED DIVIDENDS TOTALING  $121,000  IN THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $121,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  NON-INTEREST EXPENSES  SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, REGULATORY ASSESSMENTS, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES, INTERNET BANKING, AND DATA PROCESSING ARE THE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF NON-INTEREST EXPENSES.  NON-INTEREST EXPENSES  INCREASE  D  $299,000  OR  2.63%  TO  $11,667,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $11,368,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THE NET  INCREASE  FOR THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  WAS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY OF  $565,000  , SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS OF  $74,000  , AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES OF  $80,000  , DIRECTORS\u2019 EXPENSES OF  $86,000  , AND ADVERTISING OF  $13,000  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES OF  $217,000  , PROFESSIONAL SERVICES OF  $111,000  , DATA PROCESSING EXPENSES OF  $85,000  , OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSES OF  $58,000  , OTHER NON-INTEREST EXPENSES OF  $27,000  , ATM/DEBIT CARD EXPENSES OF  $10,000  , AND REGULATORY ASSESSMENTS OF  $10,000  .  THE INCREASE IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXPENSES WAS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY OUTSOURCING ITS NETWORK MAINTENANCE AND IT SUPPORT DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WHICH ALSO PRODUCED DECREASES IN SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.  THE INCREASE IN THE DIRECTORS\u2019 EXPENSES WAS RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO CALCULATE THE LIABILITY FOR DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND SPLIT DOLLAR PLANS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFICIENCY RATIO, MEASURED AS THE PERCENTAGE OF NON-INTEREST EXPENSES (EXCLUSIVE OF AMORTIZATION OF CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND FORECLOSURE EXPENSES) TO NET INTEREST INCOME BEFORE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES (CALCULATED ON A FULLY TAX EQUIVALENT BASIS) PLUS NON-INTEREST INCOME (EXCLUSIVE OF NET REALIZED GAINS ON SALES AND CALLS OF INVESTMENTS, OREO RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES, AND GAINS RELATED TO THE COLLECTION OF LIFE INSURANCE PROCEEDS) WAS  63.92%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO  62.59%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN THE EFFICIENCY RATIO IS DUE TO THE GROWTH IN NON-INTEREST EXPENSE OUTPACING THE GROWTH IN NON-INTEREST INCOME.  SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS  INCREASE  D  $74,000  OR  1.15%  TO  $6,490,000  FOR THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $6,416,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  FULL TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES WERE  293  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  325  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THE DECREASE OF SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS IN 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 IS A RESULT OF A DECREASE OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES, OFFSET BY NORMAL CYCLES AND SALARY INCREASES, AND BONUS PAYOUTS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT EXPENSE  DECREASE  D  $58,000  OR  3.77%  TO  $1,479,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  $1,537,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THE COMPANY MADE NO CHANGES IN ITS DEPRECIATION EXPENSE METHODOLOGY.  THE COMPANY OPERATED 21 FULL-SERVICE OFFICES AT  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO 24 AT  MARCH 31, 2018  .  SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, THE COMPANY CLOSED ITS TRACY OFFICE AND SOLD A PORTION OF THE CUSTOMER DEPOSITS TO ANOTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.  THE COMPANY ALSO CONSOLIDATED TWO BANKING OFFICES INTO BRANCHES CURRENTLY SERVING THE SAME COMMUNITIES - ONE IN VISALIA AND ONE IN FOLSOM DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  DATA PROCESSING EXPENSE  DECREASE  D TO  $395,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  $480,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , WHICH IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF OPERATIONS AFTER THE CONVERSION OF THE FOLSOM LAKE BANK ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED IN OCTOBER 2017 AND LOWER OUTSOURCING EXPENSES.  REGULATORY ASSESSMENTS  DECREASE  D TO  $152,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  $162,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THE ASSESSMENT BASE FOR CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OWED IS AVERAGE ASSETS MINUS AVERAGE TANGIBLE EQUITY.  PROFESSIONAL SERVICES  DECREASE  D BY  $111,000  IN THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE TO LOWER LEGAL EXPENSES AND CONSULTING FEES.

THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS THE RESULT OF A DECREASE IN TAX EXEMPT INTEREST.  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS A COMPONENT OF TAX EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  IF DEEMED NECESSARY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A RESERVE FOR UNCERTAIN INCOME TAXES WHERE THE MERITS OF THE POSITION TAKEN OR THE AMOUNT OF THE POSITION THAT WOULD BE ULTIMATELY SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION DO NOT MEET A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT CRITERIA.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE RESERVE FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WAS  ZERO.  FINANCIAL CONDITION  SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  DECEMBER 31, 2018  TOTAL ASSETS WERE  $1,564,237,000  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $1,537,836,000  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , AN  INCREASE  OF  1.72%  OR  $26,401,000  .

ACCRUED INTEREST PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES WAS  $32,063,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $20,645,000  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , AN  INCREASE  OF  $11,418,000.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FAIR VALUE  THE COMPANY MEASURES THE FAIR VALUES OF ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS UTILIZING A HIERARCHICAL FRAMEWORK ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEVEL OF OBSERVABLE PRICING SCENARIOS UTILIZED IN MEASURING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE.  THE DEGREE OF JUDGMENT UTILIZED IN MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS GENERALLY CORRELATES TO THE LEVEL OF THE OBSERVABLE PRICING SCENARIO.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH READILY AVAILABLE ACTIVELY QUOTED PRICES OR FOR WHICH FAIR VALUE CAN BE MEASURED FROM ACTIVELY QUOTED PRICES GENERALLY WILL HAVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF OBSERVABLE PRICING AND A LESSER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT UTILIZED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE.  CONVERSELY, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RARELY TRADED OR NOT QUOTED WILL GENERALLY HAVE LITTLE OR NO OBSERVABLE PRICING AND A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT UTILIZED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE.  OBSERVABLE PRICING SCENARIOS ARE IMPACTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE TYPE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT, WHETHER THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT IS NEW TO THE MARKET AND NOT YET ESTABLISHED AND THE CHARACTERISTICS SPECIFIC TO THE TRANSACTION.  SEE  NOTE 2  OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE LEVEL OF PRICING TRANSPARENCY ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE.  INVESTMENTS  OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTITIES AND AGENCIES COLLATERALIZED BY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BACKED OBLIGATIONS, PRIVATE LABEL MORTGAGE AND ASSET BACKED SECURITIES (PLMABS), CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES, AND OBLIGATIONS OF STATES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISION SECURITIES AND ARE CLASSIFIED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE OR HELD TO MATURITY.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , INVESTMENT SECURITIES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF  $71,665,000  , OR  14.94%  OF OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, WERE HELD AS COLLATERAL FOR PUBLIC FUNDS, SHORT AND LONG-TERM BORROWINGS, TREASURY, TAX, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.  OUR INVESTMENT POLICIES ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND IMPLEMENTED BY MANAGEMENT.  THEY ARE DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY, TO ENABLE US TO MEET OUR PLEDGING REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC MONEY AND BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS, TO GENERATE A FAVORABLE RETURN ON INVESTMENTS WITHOUT INCURRING UNDUE INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT RISK, AND TO COMPLEMENT OUR LENDING ACTIVITIES.  THE LEVEL OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL EARNING ASSETS IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED HIGHER THAN OUR PEERS DUE PRIMARILY TO A COMPARATIVELY LOW LOAN-TO-DEPOSIT RATIO.  OUR LOAN-TO-DEPOSIT RATIO AT  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  71.32%  COMPARED TO  71.64%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE LOAN-TO-DEPOSIT RATIO OF OUR PEERS WAS  82.00%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE TOTAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD AND INTEREST-EARNING DEPOSITS IN OTHER BANKS,  INCREASE  D  2.41%  OR  $11,509,000  TO  $489,441,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , FROM  $477,932,000  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO REFLECTED A NET UNREALIZED  GAIN  OF  $1,309,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO A NET UNREALIZED  LOSS  OF  $6,257,000  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THE BOARD AND MANAGEMENT HAVE HAD PERIODIC DISCUSSIONS ABOUT OUR STRATEGY FOR RISK MANAGEMENT IN DEALING WITH POTENTIAL LOSSES SHOULD INTEREST RATES BEGIN TO RISE.  WE HAVE BEEN MANAGING THE PORTFOLIO WITH AN OBJECTIVE OF MINIMIZING THE RISK OF RISING INTEREST RATES ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OVERALL PORTFOLIO.  WE HAVE RESTRUCTURED THE PORTFOLIO A FEW TIMES BY SELLING OFF SECURITIES AND INVESTING IN VARIABLE RATE SECURITIES WITH SHORTER DURATION.  THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY EVALUATES EACH INVESTMENT SECURITY FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, RELYING PRIMARILY ON INDUSTRY ANALYST REPORTS, OBSERVATION OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS.  THE PORTION OF THE IMPAIRMENT THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A SHORTAGE IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATIVE TO THE AMORTIZED COST SHOULD BE RECORDED AS A CURRENT PERIOD CHARGE TO EARNINGS.  THE DISCOUNT RATE IN THIS ANALYSIS IS THE ORIGINAL YIELD EXPECTED AT TIME OF PURCHASE.  MANAGEMENT EVALUATED ALL AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES WITH AN UNREALIZED LOSS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND IDENTIFIED THOSE THAT HAD AN UNREALIZED LOSS FOR AT LEAST A CONSECUTIVE 12 MONTH PERIOD, WHICH HAD AN UNREALIZED LOSS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  GREATER THAN 10% OF THE RECORDED BOOK VALUE ON THAT DATE, OR WHICH HAD AN UNREALIZED LOSS OF MORE THAN $10,000.  MANAGEMENT ALSO ANALYZED ANY SECURITIES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DOWNGRADED BY CREDIT RATING AGENCIES.  FOR THOSE SECURITIES THAT MET THE EVALUATION CRITERIA, MANAGEMENT OBTAINED AND REVIEWED THE MOST RECENTLY PUBLISHED NATIONAL CREDIT RATINGS FOR THOSE SECURITIES.  FOR THOSE SECURITIES THAT WERE OBLIGATIONS OF STATES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS WITH AN INVESTMENT GRADE RATING BY THE RATING AGENCIES, THE COMPANY ALSO EVALUATED THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE MUNICIPALITY AND ANY APPLICABLE MUNICIPAL BOND INSURANCE PROVIDER AND CONCLUDED THERE WERE NO OTTI LOSSES RECORDED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  .  THERE WERE NO OTTI LOSSES RECORDED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HELD  SIX  U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES OF WHICH  FOUR  WERE IN A LOSS POSITION FOR LESS THAN 12 MONTHS AND  TWO  HAD BEEN IN A LOSS POSITION FOR 12 MONTHS OR MORE.  THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ON THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENTS IN DIRECT OBLIGATIONS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WERE CAUSED BY INTEREST RATE CHANGES.  THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THOSE INVESTMENTS DO NOT PERMIT THE ISSUER TO SETTLE THE SECURITIES AT A PRICE LESS THAN THE AMORTIZED COSTS OF THE INVESTMENT.  BECAUSE THE DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND NOT CREDIT QUALITY, AND BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD, AND IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT IT WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL THOSE INVESTMENTS UNTIL A RECOVERY OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH MAY BE THE MATURITY DATE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER THOSE INVESTMENTS TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AT  MARCH 31, 2019.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HELD  55  OBLIGATIONS OF STATES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISION SECURITIES OF WHICH  NONE  WERE IN A LOSS POSITION FOR LESS THAN 12 MONTHS AND  ONE  HAD BEEN IN A LOSS POSITION FOR 12 MONTHS OR MORE.  THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ON THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENTS IN OBLIGATIONS OF STATES AND POLITICAL SUBDIVISION SECURITIES WERE CAUSED BY INTEREST RATE CHANGES.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BECAUSE THE DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND NOT CREDIT QUALITY, AND BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO HOLD AND DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL, AND IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT IT WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL THOSE INVESTMENTS UNTIL A RECOVERY OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH MAY BE MATURITY, THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER THOSE INVESTMENTS TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AT MARCH 31, 2019.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HELD  132  U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTITY AND AGENCY SECURITIES COLLATERALIZED BY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS OF WHICH  21  WERE IN A LOSS POSITION FOR LESS THAN 12 MONTHS AND  45  HAVE BEEN IN A LOSS POSITION FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS.  THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ON THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENTS IN U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTITIES AND AGENCIES COLLATERALIZED BY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS WERE CAUSED BY INTEREST RATE CHANGES.  THE CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS OF THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE GUARANTEED BY AN AGENCY OR SPONSORED ENTITY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.  ACCORDINGLY, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE SECURITIES WOULD NOT BE SETTLED AT A PRICE LESS THAN THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT.  BECAUSE THE DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND NOT CREDIT QUALITY, AND BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO HOLD AND DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL, AND IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT IT WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL THOSE INVESTMENTS UNTIL A RECOVERY OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH MAY BE MATURITY, THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER THOSE INVESTMENTS TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AT  MARCH 31, 2019.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD A TOTAL OF  36  PRIVATE LABEL MORTGAGE AND ASSET BACKED SECURITIES (PLMABS) WITH A REMAINING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF  $126,872,000  AND A NET UNREALIZED  GAIN  OF APPROXIMATELY  $245,000.  SIX  OF THE PLMABS SECURITIES WERE IN A LOSS POSITION FOR LESS THAN 12 MONTHS AND  17  HAVE BEEN IN LOSS FOR MORE THAN 12 MONTHS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  . BECAUSE THE DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND NOT CREDIT QUALITY, AND BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD, AND IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT IT WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL THOSE INVESTMENTS UNTIL A RECOVERY OF FAIR VALUE, WHICH MAY BE THE MATURITY DATE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER THOSE INVESTMENTS TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AT  MARCH 31, 2019  .  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MONITOR THESE SECURITIES FOR INDICATIONS THAT DECLINES IN VALUE, IF ANY, MAY BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

THIS LEVEL OF CONCENTRATION OF COMMERCIAL LOANS AND LOANS COLLATERALIZED BY REAL ESTATE IS CONSISTENT WITH  95.8%  OF TOTAL LOANS AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE LOANS WITHIN THIS CONCENTRATION HAVE NO MORE THAN THE NORMAL RISK OF COLLECTIBILITY, A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ECONOMY IN GENERAL OR A DECLINE IN REAL ESTATE VALUES IN OUR PRIMARY MARKET AREAS, IN PARTICULAR, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON COLLECTIBILITY, INCREASE THE LEVEL OF REAL ESTATE-RELATED NON-PERFORMING LOANS, OR HAVE OTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS WHICH ALONE OR IN THE AGGREGATE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.  THE COMPANY WAS NOT INVOLVED IN ANY SUB-PRIME MORTGAGE LENDING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  OR TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  OR  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE FLB, SVB AND VCB ACQUISITIONS HAD A BALANCE OF  $175,177,000  , OF WHICH  $5,195,000  WERE COMMERCIAL LOANS,  $145,237,000  WERE REAL ESTATE LOANS, AND  $24,745,000  WERE CONSUMER LOANS.  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , LOANS ACQUIRED IN THE FLB, SVB AND VCB ACQUISITIONS HAD A BALANCE OF  $189,719,000  , OF WHICH  $5,875,000  WERE COMMERCIAL LOANS,  $158,025,000  WERE REAL ESTATE LOANS, AND  $25,819,000  WERE CONSUMER LOANS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOAN UNDERWRITING POLICIES AND PRACTICES RESULT IN PRUDENT EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT, BUT RECOGNIZE THAT OUR LENDING ACTIVITIES RESULT IN RELATIVELY HIGH REPORTED COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LENDING LEVELS.  COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS INCLUDE CERTAIN LOANS WHICH REPRESENT LOW TO MODERATE RISK AND CERTAIN LOANS WITH HIGHER RISKS.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEW AND APPROVE CONCENTRATION LIMITS AND EXCEPTIONS TO LIMITATIONS OF CONCENTRATION ARE REPORTED TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT LEAST QUARTERLY.  NONPERFORMING ASSETS  NONPERFORMING ASSETS CONSIST OF NONPERFORMING LOANS, OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED (OREO), AND REPOSSESSED ASSETS.  NONPERFORMING LOANS ARE THOSE LOANS WHICH HAVE (I) BEEN PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS; (II) BEEN CLASSIFIED AS DOUBTFUL UNDER OUR ASSET CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM; OR (III) BECOME CONTRACTUALLY PAST DUE 90 DAYS OR MORE WITH RESPECT TO PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST AND HAVE NOT BEEN RESTRUCTURED OR OTHERWISE PLACED ON NONACCRUAL STATUS.  A LOAN IS CLASSIFIED AS NONACCRUAL WHEN (I) IT IS MAINTAINED ON A CASH BASIS BECAUSE OF DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE BORROWER; (II) PAYMENT IN FULL OF PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST UNDER THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS IS NOT EXPECTED; OR (III) PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST HAS BEEN IN DEFAULT FOR A PERIOD OF 90 DAYS OR MORE UNLESS THE LOAN IS BOTH WELL SECURED AND IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , TOTAL NONPERFORMING ASSETS TOTALED  $1,548,000  , OR  0.10%  OF TOTAL ASSETS, COMPARED TO  $2,740,000  , OR  0.18%  OF TOTAL ASSETS AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .

NONPERFORMING ASSETS AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  CONSISTED OF  $2,740,000  IN NONACCRUAL LOANS,  NO  OREO, AND  NO  OTHER REPOSSESSED ASSETS.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  NO  LOANS CONSIDERED TO BE TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (\u201cTDRS\u201d) INCLUDED IN NONACCRUAL LOANS COMPARED TO  ONE  TDR TOTALING  $50,000  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  A SUMMARY OF NONPERFORMING LOANS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  IS SET FORTH BELOW.  THE COMPANY HAD NO LOANS PAST DUE MORE THAN 90 DAYS AND STILL ACCRUING INTEREST AT  MARCH 31, 2019  OR  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .

AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD IMPAIRED LOANS TOTALING  $4,683,000  AND  $5,909,000  , RESPECTIVELY.  FOR COLLATERAL DEPENDENT LOANS SECURED BY REAL ESTATE, WE OBTAIN EXTERNAL VALUATIONS WHICH ARE UPDATED AT LEAST ANNUALLY TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL, AND WE RECORD AN IMMEDIATE CHARGE OFF FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BOOK VALUE OF THE LOAN AND THE APPRAISED VALUE LESS SELLING COSTS VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL.  WE PERFORM QUARTERLY INTERNAL REVIEWS ON SUBSTANDARD LOANS.  WE PLACE LOANS ON NONACCRUAL STATUS AND CLASSIFY THEM AS IMPAIRED WHEN IT BECOMES PROBABLE THAT WE WILL NOT RECEIVE INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL UNDER THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS, OR WHEN LOANS ARE DELINQUENT 90 DAYS OR MORE UNLESS THE LOAN IS BOTH WELL SECURED AND IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION.  MANAGEMENT MAINTAINS CERTAIN LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT CURRENT BY THE BORROWER (LESS THAN 30 DAYS DELINQUENT) ON NONACCRUAL STATUS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE LOANS ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN CURRENT IN FUTURE PERIODS.

WE HAD NO OREO PROPERTIES AT  MARCH 31, 2019  OR  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE COMPANY HELD  NO  REPOSSESSED ASSETS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  OR  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES MADE UP OF GENERAL AND SPECIFIC ALLOCATIONS.  THE METHODOLOGY IS SET FORTH IN A FORMAL POLICY AND TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE NEED FOR AN OVERALL  46  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AS WELL AS SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES THAT ARE TIED TO INDIVIDUAL LOANS.  THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S LOAN PORTFOLIO.  THE ALLOWANCE CONSISTS OF TWO PRIMARY COMPONENTS, SPECIFIC RESERVES RELATED TO IMPAIRED LOANS AND GENERAL RESERVES FOR PROBABLE INCURRED LOSSES RELATED TO LOANS THAT ARE NOT IMPAIRED.  FOR ALL PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS, THE DETERMINATION OF THE GENERAL RESERVE FOR LOANS THAT ARE NOT IMPAIRED IS BASED ON ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CONSIDERATION OF HISTORICAL LOSSES BY PORTFOLIO SEGMENT (AND IN CERTAIN CASES PEER LOSS DATA) OVER THE MOST RECENT  20  QUARTERS, AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS INCLUDING ECONOMIC TRENDS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S SERVICE AREAS, INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND TRENDS, GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS, ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUES, THE COMPANY\u2019S UNDERWRITING POLICIES, THE CHARACTER OF THE LOAN PORTFOLIO, AND PROBABLE LOSSES INCURRED IN THE PORTFOLIO TAKEN AS A WHOLE.  MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE MOST RECENT  20  QUARTERS WAS AN APPROPRIATE LOOK BACK PERIOD BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND VARIOUS NATIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS, AND A TIME PERIOD SUFFICIENT TO CAPTURE ENOUGH DATA DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE PORTFOLIO TO PRODUCE STATISTICALLY ACCURATE HISTORICAL LOSS CALCULATIONS.  WE BELIEVE THIS PERIOD IS AN APPROPRIATE LOOK BACK PERIOD.  IN ORIGINATING LOANS, WE RECOGNIZE THAT LOSSES WILL BE EXPERIENCED AND THAT THE RISK OF LOSS WILL VARY WITH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TYPE OF LOAN BEING MADE, THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER OVER THE TERM OF THE LOAN, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND, IN THE CASE OF A SECURED LOAN, THE QUALITY OF THE COLLATERAL SECURING THE LOAN.  THE ALLOWANCE IS INCREASED BY PROVISIONS CHARGED AGAINST EARNINGS AND RECOVERIES, AND REDUCED BY NET LOAN CHARGE OFFS.  LOANS ARE CHARGED OFF WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE, OR PARTIALLY CHARGED OFF WHEN PORTIONS OF A LOAN ARE DEEMED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE.  RECOVERIES ARE GENERALLY RECORDED ONLY WHEN CASH PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED.  THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS MAINTAINED TO COVER PROBABLE INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO.  THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE REVIEW OF OUR ASSETS AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE ADEQUACY LIES WITH MANAGEMENT AND OUR AUDIT COMMITTEE.  THEY DELEGATE THE AUTHORITY TO THE  CHIEF CREDIT OFFICER (CCO) TO DETERMINE THE LOSS RESERVE RATIO FOR EACH TYPE OF ASSET AND TO REVIEW, AT LEAST QUARTERLY, THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF THE PORTFOLIO, PAST EXPERIENCE, PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, AMOUNT OF GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES, CONCENTRATION IN LOAN TYPES AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS.  THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS AN ESTIMATE OF THE PROBABLE INCURRED CREDIT LOSSES IN OUR LOAN AND LEASE PORTFOLIO.  THE ALLOWANCE IS BASED ON PRINCIPLES OF ACCOUNTING: (I) LOSSES ACCRUED FOR ON LOANS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE OF OCCURRING AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND (II) LOSSES ACCRUED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL, PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS OR VALUES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE SECONDARY MARKET AND THE LOAN BALANCE.  MANAGEMENT ADHERES TO AN INTERNAL ASSET REVIEW SYSTEM AND LOSS ALLOWANCE METHODOLOGY DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FOR TIMELY RECOGNITION OF PROBLEM ASSETS AND ADEQUATE VALUATION ALLOWANCES TO COVER PROBABLE INCURRED LOSSES.  THE BANK\u2019S ASSET MONITORING PROCESS INCLUDES THE USE OF ASSET CLASSIFICATIONS TO SEGREGATE THE ASSETS, LARGELY LOANS AND REAL ESTATE, INTO VARIOUS RISK CATEGORIES.  THE BANK USES THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSIFICATIONS AS A MEANS OF MEASURING RISK AND DETERMINING THE ADEQUACY OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES BY USING A NINE-GRADE SYSTEM TO CLASSIFY ASSETS.  IN GENERAL, ALL CREDIT FACILITIES EXCEEDING 90 DAYS OF DELINQUENCY REQUIRE CLASSIFICATION AND ARE PLACED ON NONACCRUAL.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AT THE DATES AND FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.

OUR MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO MONITOR THESE CREDITS WITH A VIEW TO IDENTIFYING AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE WHEN, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS MAY BE NECESSARY.  THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS REVIEWED AT LEAST QUARTERLY BY THE BANK\u2019S AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS\u2019 AUDIT COMMITTEE.  RESERVES ARE ALLOCATED TO LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENTS USING PERCENTAGES WHICH ARE BASED ON BOTH HISTORICAL RISK ELEMENTS SUCH AS DELINQUENCIES AND LOSSES AND PREDICTIVE RISK ELEMENTS SUCH AS ECONOMIC, COMPETITIVE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS.  WE HAVE ADOPTED THE SPECIFIC RESERVE APPROACH TO ALLOCATE RESERVES TO EACH IMPAIRED ASSET FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTIMATING POTENTIAL LOSS EXPOSURE.  ALTHOUGH THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS PORTFOLIO CATEGORIES, IT IS GENERAL IN NATURE AND AVAILABLE FOR THE LOAN PORTFOLIO IN ITS ENTIRETY.  ADDITIONS MAY BE REQUIRED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF INDEPENDENT LOAN PORTFOLIO EXAMINATIONS, REGULATORY AGENCY EXAMINATIONS, OR OUR OWN INTERNAL REVIEW PROCESS.  ADDITIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED WHEN, IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT, THE RESERVE DOES NOT PROPERLY REFLECT THE POTENTIAL LOSS EXPOSURE.  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE BALANCE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (ALLL) WAS  $9,118,000  COMPARED TO  $9,104,000  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE  INCREASE  WAS DUE TO NET RECOVERIES OFFSET BY REVERSE PROVISION OF  $25,000  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  .  THE BALANCE OF UNDISBURSED COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT ON CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT WAS  $326,191,000  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $312,274,000  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE BALANCE OF A CONTINGENT ALLOCATION FOR PROBABLE LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE ON UNFUNDED OBLIGATIONS WAS  $250,000  AND  $225,000  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE CONTINGENT ALLOCATION FOR PROBABLE LOAN LOSS EXPERIENCE ON UNFUNDED OBLIGATIONS IS CALCULATED BY MANAGEMENT USING APPROPRIATE, SYSTEMATIC, AND CONSISTENTLY APPLIED PROCESSES.  WHILE RELATED TO CREDIT LOSSES, THIS ALLOCATION IS NOT A PART OF THE ALLL AND IS CONSIDERED SEPARATELY AS A LIABILITY FOR ACCOUNTING AND REGULATORY REPORTING PURPOSES.  RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES EXIST IN ALL LENDING TRANSACTIONS AND OUR MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS\u2019 LOAN COMMITTEE HAVE ESTABLISHED RESERVE LEVELS BASED ON ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER RISKS THAT EXIST AS OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE ALLL WAS  0.99%  OF TOTAL GROSS LOANS COMPARED TO  0.99%  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  TOTAL LOANS INCLUDE FLB, SVB AND VCB LOANS THAT WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITIONS, WHICH STOOD AT  $175,177,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  $189,719,000  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  EXCLUDING THESE FLB, SVB AND VCB LOANS FROM THE CALCULATION, THE ALLL TO TOTAL GROSS LOANS WAS  1.22%  AND  1.25%  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY AND GENERAL RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH NON-IMPAIRED LOANS TO TOTAL NON-IMPAIRED LOANS WAS  1.22%  AND  1.25%  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE LOAN PORTFOLIOS ACQUIRED IN THE MERGERS WERE BOOKED AT FAIR VALUE WITH NO ASSOCIATED ALLOCATION IN THE ALLL.  THE SIZE OF THE FAIR VALUE DISCOUNT REMAINS ADEQUATE FOR ALL NON-IMPAIRED ACQUIRED LOANS; THEREFORE, THERE IS NO ASSOCIATED ALLOCATION IN THE ALLL FOR THOSE LOANS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S LOAN PORTFOLIO BALANCES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  INCREASED THROUGH ORGANIC GROWTH.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CHANGE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO TOTAL LOANS RATIO IS DIRECTIONALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPOSITION OF LOANS AND THE LEVEL OF NONPERFORMING AND CLASSIFIED LOANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS EXPERIENCED IN THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES SERVICED BY THE COMPANY AND RECENT IMPROVEMENTS IN REAL ESTATE COLLATERAL VALUES.  ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE COLLATERAL VALUE OF VARIOUS UNDER-PERFORMING LOANS MAY AFFECT THE LEVEL AND ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN FUTURE PERIODS.  THE ALLOWANCE MAY ALSO BE AFFECTED BY TRENDS IN THE AMOUNT OF CHARGE-OFFS EXPERIENCED OR EXPECTED TRENDS WITHIN DIFFERENT LOAN PORTFOLIOS.  HOWEVER, THE TOTAL RESERVE RATES ON NON-IMPAIRED LOANS INCLUDE QUALITATIVE FACTORS WHICH ARE SYSTEMATICALLY DERIVED AND CONSISTENTLY APPLIED TO REFLECT CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATED LOSSES FROM LOSS CONTINGENCIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  BASED ON THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS AND GIVEN RECENT CHANGES IN HISTORICAL CHARGE-OFF RATES INCLUDED IN THE ALLL MODELING AND THE CHANGES IN OTHER FACTORS, MANAGEMENT DETERMINED THAT THE ALLL WAS APPROPRIATE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  .  HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY MAY NOT SUSTAIN CHARGE-OFFS WHICH ARE IN EXCESS OF THE ALLOWANCE IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES AND SETS FORTH ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS WHICH PORTRAYS THE TRENDS THAT ARE OCCURRING IN THE LOAN PORTFOLIO.

TOTAL GOODWILL AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WAS  $53,777,000  CONSISTING OF  $8,934,000  ,  $14,643,000  ,  $6,340,000  ,  $10,394,000  , AND  $13,466,000  REPRESENTING THE EXCESS OF THE COST OF BANK OF MADERA COUNTY, SERVICE 1  ST  BANCORP, VISALIA COMMUNITY BANK, SIERRA VISTA BANK, AND FOLSOM LAKE BANK, RESPECTIVELY, OVER THE NET OF THE AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN THE TRANSACTIONS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.  THE VALUE OF GOODWILL IS ULTIMATELY DERIVED FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO GENERATE NET EARNINGS AFTER THE ACQUISITIONS AND IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES.  THE FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT DURING THE FIRST TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THE ACQUISITION DATE IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE TO INDICATE A MORE ACCURATE OR APPROPRIATE VALUE FOR AN ASSET OR LIABILITY.  A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN NET EARNINGS COULD BE INDICATIVE OF A DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL AND RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT.  FOR THAT REASON, GOODWILL IS ASSESSED AT LEAST ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT.  MANAGEMENT PERFORMED AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 UTILIZING VARIOUS QUALITATIVE FACTORS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE FACTORS ARE SUFFICIENT AND COMPREHENSIVE AND AS SUCH, NO FURTHER FACTORS NEED TO BE ASSESSED AT THIS TIME.  BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S ANALYSIS PERFORMED, NO IMPAIRMENT WAS REQUIRED.  GOODWILL IS ALSO TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY BELOW ITS CARRYING AMOUNT.  NO SUCH EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES AROSE DURING THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019.  THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE CORE DEPOSIT RELATIONSHIPS ACQUIRED IN THE 2017 ACQUISITION OF FOLSOM LAKE BANK OF $1,879,000, THE 2016 ACQUISITION OF SIERRA VISTA BANK OF $508,000, AND THE 2013 ACQUISITION OF VISALIA COMMUNITY BANK OF $1,365,000.  CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLES ARE BEING AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD (WHICH APPROXIMATES THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD) OVER ESTIMATED LIVES OF FIVE TO  10  YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.  THE CARRYING VALUE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  $2,399,000  , NET OF  $1,353,000  IN ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.  THE CARRYING VALUE AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS  $2,572,000  , NET OF  $1,180,000  ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.  WE EVALUATE THE REMAINING USEFUL LIVES QUARTERLY TO DETERMINE WHETHER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT A REVISION TO THE REMAINING PERIODS OF AMORTIZATION.  BASED ON THE EVALUATION, NO CHANGES TO THE REMAINING USEFUL LIVES WAS REQUIRED IN THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  .  AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED WAS  $174,000  AND  $94,000  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

REFER TO THE  LIQUIDITY  SECTION BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF FHLB ADVANCES.  49  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CAPITAL  CAPITAL SERVES AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS AND HELPS PROTECT DEPOSITORS AND SHAREHOLDERS AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES.  HISTORICALLY, THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF CAPITAL FOR THE COMPANY HAS BEEN THROUGH RETAINED EARNINGS.  THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY MAINTAINED SUBSTANTIAL LEVELS OF CAPITAL.  THE ASSESSMENT OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY IS DEPENDENT ON SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING ASSET QUALITY, EARNINGS TRENDS, LIQUIDITY AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  MAINTENANCE OF ADEQUATE CAPITAL LEVELS IS INTEGRAL TO PROVIDING STABILITY TO THE COMPANY.  THE COMPANY NEEDS TO MAINTAIN SUBSTANTIAL LEVELS OF REGULATORY CAPITAL TO GIVE IT MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY IN THE CHANGING REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THE MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  OUR SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY WAS  $227,455,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $219,738,000  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  THE  INCREASE  FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  IN SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY IS THE RESULT OF AN  INCREASE  IN RETAINED EARNINGS FROM NET INCOME OF  $5,216,000  , THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS OF  $95,000  , STOCK ISSUED UNDER THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN OF  $80,000  , THE EFFECT OF SHARE BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF  $143,000  , STOCK AWARDED TO EMPLOYEES OF  $100,000  , AND AN  INCREASE  IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) OF  $5,329,000  , OFFSET BY COMMON STOCK CASH DIVIDENDS OF  $1,372,000.  ON JULY 18, 2018, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY APPROVED THE ADOPTION OF A PROGRAM TO EFFECT REPURCHASES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK.  UNDER THE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY MAY REPURCHASE UP TO $10 MILLION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, WHICH REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 3% OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, OR APPROXIMATELY  511,509  SHARES BASED ON THE CLOSING STOCK PRICE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK ON  MARCH 31, 2019  OF  $19.55  .  THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM BEGAN ON JULY 19, 2018 AND WILL END ON JULY 18, 2019.  THE SHARES WILL BE REPURCHASED IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS THROUGH BROKERS, SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  145,341  SHARES HAD BEEN REPURCHASED AND RETIRED UNDER THE PROGRAM AT AN AVERAGE PRICE PAID PER SHARE OF  $19.03.  DURING THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  , THE COMPANY DECLARED AND PAID  $1,372,000  IN CASH DIVIDENDS (  $0.10  PER COMMON SHARE) TO HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK.  THE COMPANY DECLARED AND PAID A TOTAL OF $4,270,000 IN CASH DIVIDENDS ($0.31 PER COMMON SHARE) TO HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS PART OF ITS STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS.  THE STRATEGIC PLAN CALLS FOR CONTINUING INCREASES IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND THE CAPITAL REQUIRED MAY THEREFORE BE IN EXCESS OF RETAINED EARNINGS.  THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN CAPITAL IS DEPENDENT UPON THE CAPITAL MARKETS AS WELL AS OUR PERFORMANCE.  MANAGEMENT REGULARLY EVALUATES SOURCES OF CAPITAL AND THE TIMING REQUIRED TO MEET ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.  THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS, THE FDIC AND OTHER FEDERAL BANKING AGENCIES HAVE ISSUED RISK-BASED CAPITAL ADEQUACY  GUIDELINES INTENDED TO PROVIDE A MEASURE OF CAPITAL ADEQUACY THAT REFLECTS THE DEGREE OF RISK ASSOCIATED WITH A BANKING  ORGANIZATION\u2019S OPERATIONS FOR BOTH TRANSACTIONS REPORTED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS ASSETS, AND TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS LETTERS OF  CREDIT AND RECOURSE ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH ARE REPORTED AS OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ITEMS.  50  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE COMPANY\u2019S REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.

THE COMPANY SUCCEEDED TO ALL OF THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE SERVICE 1  ST  CAPITAL TRUST I, A DELAWARE BUSINESS TRUST, IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF SERVICE 1  ST  AS OF NOVEMBER 12, 2008.  THE TRUST WAS FORMED ON AUGUST 17, 2006 FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF ISSUING TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY SERVICE 1  ST  .  UNDER APPLICABLE REGULATORY GUIDANCE, THE AMOUNT OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES THAT IS ELIGIBLE AS TIER 1 CAPITAL IS LIMITED TO 25% OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TIER 1 CAPITAL ON A PRO FORMA BASIS.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , ALL OF THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED QUALIFY AS TIER 1 CAPITAL.  THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES MATURE ON OCTOBER 7, 2036, ARE REDEEMABLE AT THE COMPANY\u2019S OPTION BEGINNING FIVE YEARS AFTER ISSUANCE, AND REQUIRE QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS BY THE TRUST TO THE HOLDER OF THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AT A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE WHICH WILL ADJUST QUARTERLY TO EQUAL THE THREE MONTH LIBOR PLUS 1.60%.  THE TRUST USED THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES TO PURCHASE APPROXIMATELY $5,155,000 IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SERVICE 1  ST  \u2019S JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES (THE NOTES).  THE NOTES BEAR INTEREST AT THE SAME VARIABLE INTEREST RATE DURING THE SAME QUARTERLY PERIODS AS THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES.  THE NOTES ARE REDEEMABLE BY THE COMPANY ON ANY JANUARY 7, APRIL 7, JULY 7, OR OCTOBER 7 ON OR AFTER OCTOBER 7, 2012 OR AT ANY TIME WITHIN 90 DAYS FOLLOWING THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS, SUCH AS: (I) A CHANGE IN THE REGULATORY CAPITAL TREATMENT OF THE NOTES; (II) IN THE EVENT THE TRUST IS DEEMED AN INVESTMENT COMPANY; OR (III) UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN ADVERSE TAX EVENTS.  IN EACH SUCH CASE, THE COMPANY MAY REDEEM THE NOTES FOR THEIR AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, PLUS ANY ACCRUED BUT UNPAID INTEREST.  THE NOTES MAY BE DECLARED IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE AT THE ELECTION OF THE TRUSTEE OR HOLDERS OF 25% OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUTSTANDING NOTES IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY DEFAULTS IN THE PAYMENT OF ANY INTEREST  51  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOLLOWING THE NONPAYMENT OF ANY SUCH INTEREST FOR 20 OR MORE CONSECUTIVE QUARTERLY PERIODS.  HOLDERS OF THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES ARE ENTITLED TO A CUMULATIVE CASH DISTRIBUTION ON THE LIQUIDATION AMOUNT OF $1,000 PER SECURITY.  FOR EACH JANUARY 7, APRIL 7, JULY 7 OR OCTOBER 7 OF EACH YEAR, THE RATE WILL BE ADJUSTED TO EQUAL THE THREE MONTH LIBOR PLUS 1.60%.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE RATE WAS  4.39%.  LIQUIDITY  LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT INVOLVES OUR ABILITY TO MEET CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS ARISING FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN DEPOSIT LEVELS AND DEMANDS OF DAILY OPERATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE FUNDING OF SECURITIES PURCHASES, PROVIDING FOR CUSTOMERS\u2019 CREDIT NEEDS AND ONGOING REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS.  OUR LIQUIDITY IS ACTIVELY MANAGED ON A DAILY BASIS AND REVIEWED PERIODICALLY BY OUR MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTOR\u2019S ASSET/LIABILITY COMMITTEES.  THIS PROCESS IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THE MAINTENANCE OF SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO MEET OUR NEEDS, INCLUDING ADEQUATE CASH FLOW FOR OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE DERIVED FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES WHICH INCLUDE THE ACCEPTANCE OF CUSTOMER AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, BROKER DEPOSITS, FEDERAL FUNDS FACILITIES WITH CORRESPONDENT BANKS, AND ADVANCES FROM THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO.  THESE FUNDING SOURCES ARE AUGMENTED BY PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON LOANS, THE ROUTINE MATURITIES AND PAY DOWNS OF SECURITIES FROM THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, THE STABILITY OF OUR CORE DEPOSITS AND THE ABILITY TO SELL INVESTMENT SECURITIES.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD UNPLEDGED SECURITIES TOTALING  $415,303,000  AVAILABLE AS A SECONDARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY AND TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $32,235,000  .  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  INCREASE  D  1.60%  COMPARED TO  $31,727,000  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .  PRIMARY USES OF FUNDS INCLUDE WITHDRAWAL OF AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON DEPOSITS, ORIGINATIONS AND PURCHASES OF LOANS, PURCHASES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, AND PAYMENT OF OPERATING EXPENSES.  AS A MEANS OF AUGMENTING OUR LIQUIDITY, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED FEDERAL FUNDS LINES WITH OUR CORRESPONDENT BANKS.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR AVAILABLE BORROWING CAPACITY INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY  $40,000,000  IN UNSECURED CREDIT LINES WITH OUR CORRESPONDENT BANKS,  $287,839,000  IN UNUSED FHLB ADVANCES AND A  $3,551,000  SECURED CREDIT LINE AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A CLINICAL-STAGE, ONCOLOGY THERAPEUTICS COMPANY, TAKING A PRECISION CANCER MEDICINE APPROACH TO DEVELOP DRUGS THAT TARGET MITOSIS (CELL DIVISION) TO TREAT VARIOUS TYPES OF CANCER, INCLUDING LEUKEMIAS, LYMPHOMAS AND SOLID TUMORS. BY INTEGRATING A BIOMARKER STRATEGY INTO OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WE WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS MORE LIKELY TO RESPOND TO TREATMENT.  ON MARCH 15, 2017, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE LICENSED ONVANSERTIB, A PLK1 INHIBITOR, FROM NERVIANO, PURSUANT TO A LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH NERVIANO DATED MARCH 13, 2017. THIS EXCLUSIVE, WORLD-WIDE LICENSE AGREEMENT INCLUDES 3 ISSUED PATENTS FOR ONVANSERTIB WHICH COVER COMPOSITION OF MATTER, SALT FORMS OF ONVANSERTIB AND COMBINATION OF ONVANSERTIB WITH OTHER DRUGS. ONVANSERTIB WAS DEVELOPED TO HAVE HIGH SELECTIVITY TO PLK1 (AT LOW NANOMOLAR IC  50  LEVELS), TO HAVE IDEAL PHARMACOKINETICS, INCLUDING ORAL BIOAVAILABILITY AND ADMINISTRATION AND A DRUG HALF-LIFE OF APPROXIMATELY 24 HOURS, ALLOWING FOR FLEXIBLE DOSING AND SCHEDULING, AND IS WELL TOLERATED AND SAFE WITH ONLY MILD- TO MODERATE SIDE EFFECTS REPORTED TO-DATE. A SAFETY STUDY OF ONVANSERTIB HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED METASTATIC SOLID TUMORS AND PUBLISHED IN 2017 IN  INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUGS.  WE CURRENTLY ARE ENROLLING A PHASE 1B/2 OPEN-LABEL CLINICAL TRIAL OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH STANDARD-OF-CARE CHEMOTHERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH AML. THE PHASE 1B/2 CLINICAL TRIAL IS LED BY HEMATOLOGIST JORGE EDUARDO CORTES, M.D., DEPUTY DEPARTMENT CHAIR, DEPARTMENT OF LEUKEMIA, DIVISION OF CANCER MEDICINE, THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER AND AMER ZEIDAN, MBBS, MHS, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT YALE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, HEMATOLOGY EXPERT AT YALE CANCER CENTER. NINE CLINICAL TRIAL SITES ACROSS THE U.S. ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN THIS TRIAL. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS ENROLLING PATIENTS FOR ITS PHASE 2 OPEN-LABEL CLINICAL TRIAL OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH ABIRATERONE ACETATE (ZYTIGA  \u00ae  ) AND PREDNISONE IN PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC CASTRATION-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER (\u201cMCRPC\u201d). THIS TRIAL IS BEING LED BY DAVID EINSTEIN, M.D., AT THE GENITOURINARY ONCOLOGY PROGRAM AT BIDMC AND HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL AND, IN ADDITION TO BIDMC, THIS TRIAL IS BEING CONDUCTED AT DFCI AND MGH. IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2019, WE PLAN TO INITIATE A PHASE 1B/2 OPEN-LABEL CLINICAL TRIAL OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH FOLFIRI AND AVASTIN  \u00ae  IN PATIENTS WITH MCRC WITH A KRAS MUTATION. THIS TRIAL WILL BE CONDUCTED AT MAYO CLINIC AND USC NORRIS COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS US TO ANALYZE CTDNA AND CLINICALLY ACTIONABLE MARKERS. UNIQUE TO OUR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN, AND A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR PRECISION CANCER MEDICINE APPROACH, IS THE INTEGRATION OF PREDICTIVE CLINICAL BIOMARKERS TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS MOST LIKELY TO RESPOND TO TREATMENT.  ONVANSERTIB IS A FIRST-IN-CLASS, 3  RD  GENERATION, ORAL AND HIGHLY-SELECTIVE PLK1 INHIBITOR WITH APPARENT ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY IN DIFFERENT PRE-CLINICAL MODELS. POLO-LIKE KINASE FAMILY CONSISTS OF 5 MEMBERS (PLK1-PLK5) AND THEY ARE INVOLVED IN MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS IN CELL DIVISION, INCLUDING THE REGULATION OF CENTROSOME MATURATION, CHECKPOINT RECOVERY, SPINDLE ASSEMBLY, CYTOKINESIS, APOPTOSIS AND MANY OTHERS. PLK1 IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF GENOMIC STABILITY DURING CELL DIVISION. THE OVER-EXPRESSION OF PLK1 CAN LEAD TO IMMATURE CELL DIVISION FOLLOWED BY ANEUPLOIDY AND CELL DEATH, A HALLMARK OF CANCER. PLK1 IS OVER-EXPRESSED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF LEUKEMIAS/LYMPHOMAS AND SOLID TUMOR CANCERS, INCLUDING ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA, NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA, PROSTATE, LUNG, BREAST, OVARIAN, COLORECTAL AND ADRENOCORTICAL CARCINOMA. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT OVER-EXPRESSION OF PLK1 IS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR PROGNOSIS. BLOCKING THE EXPRESSION OF PLK1 BY KINASE INHIBITORS, SUCH AS ONVANSERTIB, CAN EFFECTIVELY INHIBIT GROWTH OF, AND INDUCE, TUMOR CELL DEATH.  STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT INHIBITION OF POLO-LIKE-KINASES CAN LEAD TO TUMOR CELL DEATH, INCLUDING A PHASE 2 STUDY IN ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA (\u201cAML\u201d) WHERE RESPONSE RATES WITH A PRIOR PLK INHIBITOR OF UP TO 31% WERE OBSERVED WHEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A STANDARD THERAPY FOR AML (LOW-DOSE CYTARABINE (\u201cLDAC\u201d)) VERSUS A 13.3% RESPONSE RATE WITH LDAC ALONE. WE BELIEVE THE MORE SELECTIVE NATURE OF ONVANSERTIB TO PLK1, ITS 24-HOUR HALF-LIFE AND ORAL BIOAVAILABILITY, AS WELL AS ITS DEMONSTRATED SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY, WITH ONLY MILD- TO MODERATE SIDE EFFECTS REPORTED, MAY PROVE USEFUL IN ADDRESSING CLINICAL THERAPEUTIC NEEDS ACROSS A VARIETY OF CANCERS.  ONVANSERTIB HAS BEEN TESTED IN-VIVO IN DIFFERENT XENOGRAFT AND TRANSGENIC MODELS SUGGESTING TUMOR GROWTH INHIBITION OR TUMOR REGRESSION WHEN USED IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER THERAPIES. ONVANSERTIB HAS BEEN TESTED FOR ANTIPROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITY ON A PANEL OF 148 TUMOR CELL LINES AND APPEARED HIGHLY ACTIVE WITH AN IC  50  (A MEASURE CONCENTRATION FOR 50% TARGET INHIBITION) BELOW 100 NM IN 75 CELL LINES AND IC  50  VALUES BELOW 1 UM IN 133 OUT OF 148 CELL LINES. ONVANSERTIB ALSO APPEARS ACTIVE IN CELLS EXPRESSING MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT (\u201cMDR\u201d) TRANSPORTER PROTEINS AND WE BELIEVE ITS APPARENT ABILITY TO OVERCOME THE MDR TRANSPORTER RESISTANCE MECHANISM IN CANCER CELLS COULD PROVE USEFUL IN BROADER DRUG COMBINATION APPLICATIONS.  IN IN-VITRO AND IN-VIVO PRE-CLINICAL STUDIES, SYNERGY (INTERACTION OF DISCRETE DRUGS SUCH THAT THE TOTAL EFFECT IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE INDIVIDUAL EFFECTS) HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED WITH ONVANSERTIB WHEN USED IN COMBINATION WITH NUMEROUS DIFFERENT CHEMOTHERAPIES, INCLUDING CISPLATIN, CYTARABINE, DOXORUBICIN, GEMCITABINE AND PACLITAXEL, AS WELL AS TARGETED THERAPEUTICS, SUCH AS ABIRATERONE ACETATE (ZYTIGA  \u00ae  ), HISTONE DEACETYLASE (\u201cHDAC\u201d) INHIBITORS, SUCH AS BELINOSTAT (BELEODAQ  \u00ae  ), QUIZARTINIB (AC220), A DEVELOPMENT STAGE FLT3 INHIBITOR, AND BORTEZOMIB (VELCADE  \u00ae  ). THESE THERAPIES ARE USED CLINICALLY FOR THE TREATMENT OF LEUKEMIAS, LYMPHOMAS AND SOLID TUMOR CANCERS, INCLUDING AML, NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA (\u201cNHL\u201d), MCRPC, MCRC, AND TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER (\u201cTNBC\u201d).  WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON ADVANCING OUR TWO ACTIVE CLINICAL TRIALS WITH ONVANSERTIB AND TO INITIATING OUR THIRD TRIAL IN 2019. WE HAVE ACHIEVED A NUMBER OF KEY MILESTONES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND ANTICIPATE ACHIEVING THE FOLLOWING MILESTONES THROUGHOUT 2019.  PHASE 1B/2 TRIAL OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH EITHER LOW-DOSE CYTARABINE OR DECITABINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA.  \u2022  COMPLETE PHASE 1B DOSE ESCALATION COHORTS AND IDENTIFY THE RECOMMENDED PHASE 2 DOSE (\u201cRP2D\u201d) FOR THE PHASE 2 CONTINUATION TRIAL (DEPENDENT UPON THE NUMBER OF DOSE ESCALATION COHORTS REQUIRED TO REACH THE MAXIMUM TOLERATED DOSE OR RP2D OF ONVANSERTIB).  \u2022  PROVIDE TOPLINE SAFETY AND EFFICACY DATA ON THE COMBINATION OF ONVANSERTIB + LDAC AND THE COMBINATION OF ONVANSERTIB + DECITABINE IN PATIENTS TREATED THROUGH THE END OF 2018.  \u2022  PRESENT DATA FROM THE AML TRIAL AT KEY ONCOLOGY CONFERENCES, INCLUDING THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEMATOLOGY (\u201cASH\u201d) ANNUAL MEETING.  \u2022  INITIATE THE PHASE 2 SEGMENT OF THE AML TRIAL, WHICH WILL ENROLL APPROXIMATELY 32 PATIENTS, FOR CONTINUED EVALUATION OF SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH EITHER LDAC OR DECITABINE (PROVIDED THE RP2D HAS BEEN DETERMINED IN PHASE 1B).  PHASE 2 TRIAL OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH ABIRATERONE ACETATE (ZYTIGA  \u00ae  ) AND PREDNISONE FOR THE TREATMENT OF METASTATIC CASTRATION-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  PRESENTED DATA FROM THE MCRPC TRIAL AT THE GENITOURINARY CANCERS SYMPOSIUM (\u201cASCO-GU\u201d) IN FEBRUARY 2019.  \u2022  COMPLETE ENROLLMENT AND EVALUATION OF THE 3 SAFETY LEAD-IN PATIENTS IN THE SECOND ARM (2-WEEK DOSING SCHEDULE) WITH ONVANSERTIB AT 24 MG/M  2  IN COMBINATION WITH ABIRATERONE ACETATE (ZYTIGA  \u00ae  ) AND PREDNISONE.  \u2022  PROVIDE TOPLINE PRELIMINARY SAFETY AND EFFICACY DATA OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH ABIRATERONE ACETATE (ZYTIGA  \u00ae  ) AND PREDNISONE IN PATIENTS TREATED.  \u2022  PRESENT DATA FROM THE MCRPC TRIAL AT KEY ONCOLOGY CONFERENCES THROUGHOUT 2019 AND FIRST QUARTER 2020.  DURING 2019, WE HAVE ADVANCED OUR BUSINESS WITH THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES.  \u2022  ANNOUNCED DATA DEMONSTRATING SIGNIFICANT SYNERGY OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH VENETOCLAX IN CELL MODEL OF VENETOCLAX-RESISTANT AML.  ON APRIL 23, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED PRECLINICAL DATA THAT EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF COMBINING ONVANSERTIB WITH VENETOCLAX IN AN AML CELL MODEL KNOWN TO BE RESISTANT TO VENETOCLAX (VENCLEXTA  \u00ae  - ABBVIE). THIS COMBINATION DEMONSTRATED SYNERGY (THE COMBINED EFFECT OF THE TWO DRUGS IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL EFFECTS) WITH A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN TUMOR CELL VIABILITY. THIS DATA PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR CLINICAL EVALUATION OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH VENETOCLAX IN PATIENTS WITH DIFFICULT-TO-TREAT RELAPSED/REFRACTORY AML, FOR WHICH THERE ARE LIMITED TREATMENT OPTIONS AND THE PROGNOSIS IS POOR.  \u2022  ANNOUNCED UPDATE TO PHASE 1B/2 TRIAL DATA PRESENTED AT AACR - ADDITIONAL PATIENTS ACHIEVE COMPLETE RESPONSE AT TWO HIGHEST DOSE LEVELS OF ONVANSERTIB.  ON APRIL 5, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED AN UPDATE TO OUR PHASE 1B/2 TRIAL DATA PRESENTED AT AACR ON APRIL 1, SHOWING ADDITIONAL PATIENTS HAVING ACHIEVED COMPLETE RESPONSE AT THE TWO HIGHEST DOSE LEVELS OF ONVANSERTIB. A COMPLETE RESPONSE (2 CR\u2019S AND 1 CRI) WAS ACHIEVED IN 3 OF 6 (50%) OF EVALUABLE PATIENTS AT THE HIGHEST DOSES (27MG/M  2  AND 40 MG/M  2  ) OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH STANDARD-OF-CARE DECITABINE. APPROXIMATELY 90% CLINICAL BENEFIT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED (CR + PR + SD). NO DOSE-LIMITING TOXICITIES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED TO-DATE.  \u2022  ANNOUNCED EARLY DATA FROM PHASE 2 TRIAL INDICATES ACTIVITY OF ONVANSERTIB IN PROSTATE CANCER PATIENTS SHOWING INITIAL RESISTANCE TO ANTI-ANDROGEN THERAPY.  ON APRIL 2, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED EARLY DATA FROM OUR ONGOING PHASE 2 STUDY EVALUATING ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH ZYTIGA  \u00ae  IN PATIENTS WITH MCRPC. EARLY PROSTATE SPECIFIC ANTIGEN (\u201cPSA\u201d) RESPONSE WAS OBSERVED WHEN ONVANSERTIB IS ADDED TO ABIRATERONE (ZYTIGA  \u00ae  ) IN 2 OF 6 PATIENTS TO-DATE; THE FIRST PATIENT ACHIEVED THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT OF DISEASE STABILIZATION. THE PSA TRAJECTORY IN THE PATIENT ACHIEVING THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT INDICATES ALTERATION OF THE NATURAL HISTORY OF EARLY SIGNS OF RESISTANCE TO ZYTIGA  \u00ae  . PATIENTS WITH OBSERVED REPONSES TO-DATE HARBOR THE HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE ANDROGEN RECEPTOR VARIANT (AR-V7) WHICH IS KNOWN TO BE RESISTANT TO TREATMENT WITH ZYTIGA  \u00ae.  \u2022  ANNOUNCED PHASE 1B/2 DOSE ESCALATION TRIAL OF ONVANSERTIB IN RELAPSED/REFRACTORY AML DEMONSTRATES SAFETY, TOLERABILITY AND RELATIVE DURABILITY WITH COMPLETE RESPONSES AT HIGHEST DOSE LEVELS.  ON APRIL 1, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED THE PRESENTATION OF NEW DATA FROM OUR ONGOING PHASE 1B/2 STUDY EVALUATING ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH STANDARD-OF-CARE CHEMOTHERAPY IN AML. THE GREATEST ANTI-LEUKEMIC ACTIVITY HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN THE ONVANSERTIB + DECITABINE ARM, WITH COMPLETE RESPONSE IN 2 (1 CR AND 1 CRI) OF 4 (50%) OF EVALUABLE PATIENTS FROM THE TWO HIGHEST DOSE LEVELS. THERE HAVE BEEN NO DOSE-LIMITING TOXICITIES OBSERVED TO-DATE AND TWO-THIRDS OF PATIENTS HAVE COMPLETED \u22652 CYCLES OF TREATMENT, WITH 2 PATIENTS CURRENTLY ON TREATMENT FOR MORE THAN 11 AND 5 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY. THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION OBSERVED BETWEEN BIOMARKER-POSITIVE PATIENTS AND RESPONSE TO ONVANSERTIB TREATMENT.  \u2022  ANNOUNCED PRESENTATION UPDATE ON PHASE 2 STUDY OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH ZYTIGA  \u00ae  IN PATIENTS WITH MCRPC AT ASCO-GU.  ON FEBRUARY 14, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED AN UPDATE ON OUR PHASE 2 STUDY OF ONVANSERTIB IN COMBINATION WITH ZYTIGA  \u00ae  IN PATIENTS WITH MCRPC WAS PRESENTED AT THE GENITOURINARY CANCERS SYMPOSIUM. THE DATA PRESENTED CONFIRMED THE SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY OF THE COMBINATION AND THE EXPANSION OF THE TRIAL TO INCLUDE AN ALTERNATE DOSING SCHEDULE TO MAXIMIZE OBSERVED CLINICAL ACTIVITY.  \u2022  ENTERED AGREEMENT WITH POC CAPITAL, LLC TO FUND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF ONVANSERTIB IN MCRC.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON JANUARY 29, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT WITH POC CAPITAL, LLC, TO FUND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF ONVANSERTIB IN A PHASE1B/2 CLINICAL TRIAL IN PATIENTS WITH MCRC. WE SUBMITTED AN INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION AND PROTOCOL TO THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) ON DECEMBER 19, 2018, AND RECEIVED A \u201cSTUDY MAY PROCEED\u201d NOTIFICATION FROM THE FDA, 28-DAYS LATER, ON JANUARY 16, 2019. THE TRIAL WILL BE CONDUCTED AT TWO PRESTIGIOUS CANCER CENTERS IN THE U.S.; USC NORRIS COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER AND THE MAYO CLINIC.  \u2022  ANNOUNCED NEW PATENT ISSUED FOR COMBINATION OF ONVANSERTIB WITH ANTI-ANDROGEN DRUGS TO TREAT NON-METASTATIC AND METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER.  ON JANUARY 23, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED THE ISSUANCE OF A NEW PATENT (10,155,006), ENTITLED  COMBINATION THERAPIES AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF FOR TREATING CANCER,  BY THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (\u201cUSPTO\u201d). THIS PATENT BROADENS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED PATENT (9,566,280), BY EXPANDING THE USE OF ONVANSERTIB TO ENCOMPASS COMBINATION THERAPIES WITH ANY ANTI-ANDROGEN AND ANDROGEN ANTAGONIST DRUG, SUCH AS ZYTIGA  \u00ae  , XTANDI  \u00ae  AND ERLEADA  \u00ae  FOR THE TREATMENT OF METASTATIC AND NON-METASTATIC CASTRATE-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER.  OUR ACCUMULATED DEFICIT THROUGH  MARCH 31, 2019  IS  $196,370,315  . TO DATE, WE HAVE GENERATED MINIMAL REVENUES AND EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LOSSES TO PERFORM FURTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.  OUR DRUG DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE IN THEIR EARLY STAGES, AND WE CANNOT MAKE ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS OR THE TIME THAT OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WILL TAKE TO COMPLETE, OR THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REVENUES RELATED TO THE SALE OF OUR DRUGS. THE RISK OF COMPLETION OF ANY PROGRAM IS HIGH BECAUSE OF THE MANY UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING NEW DRUG CANDIDATES TO MARKET, INCLUDING THE LONG DURATION OF CLINICAL TESTING, THE SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE OF PROPOSED PRODUCTS UNDER STRINGENT CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOLS, EXTENDED REGULATORY APPROVAL AND REVIEW CYCLES, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, THE NATURE AND TIMING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, AND COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES BEING DEVELOPED BY ORGANIZATIONS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RESOURCES.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  FINANCIAL REPORTING RELEASE NO. 60 REQUIRES ALL COMPANIES TO INCLUDE A DISCUSSION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , FILED WITH THE SEC ON MARCH 6, 2019. THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OTHER THAN ADOPTION OF ASC 842 SINCE  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  REVENUES  OUR TOTAL REVENUES WERE  $161,958  AND  $100,136  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPONENTS OF OUR REVENUES WERE AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  INCREASE (DECREASE)  ROYALTIES  $62,021  $49,055  $12,966  SERVICES AND OTHER  99,937  51,081  48,856  TOTAL REVENUES  $161,958  $100,136  $61,822  THE INCREASE IN ROYALTY INCOME RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE HIGHER ACCRUED REVENUE BASED ON HISTORICAL USAGE RATE AND COLLECTABILITY. THE INCREASE IN SERVICE AND OTHER REVENUE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD IS PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM THE SUBLEASE INCOME RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE UPON ADOPTION OF ASC 842 IN 2019, OFFSET BY DECREASE IN SERVICE REVENUE AS A RESULT OF THE DISPOSITION OF OUR CLIA LABORATORY. WE EXPECT OUR ROYALTIES TO FLUCTUATE AS THE  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ROYALTIES ARE SALES-BASED OR USAGE-BASED ROYALTIES ON OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSE. REVENUE RECOGNITION OF THE ROYALTY DEPENDS ON THE TIMING AND OVERALL SALES ACTIVITIES OF THE LICENSEES.  COST OF REVENUES  OUR TOTAL COST OF REVENUES WAS  $0  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $366,344  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF  2018  . COST OF REVENUES MAINLY RELATES TO THE COSTS OF OUR DIAGNOSTIC SERVICE REVENUES. THE DECREASE IN COST OF REVENUES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF LAST YEAR IS MAINLY DUE TO THE DISPOSITION OF OUR CLIA LABORATORY. WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY COST OF REVENUE FOR 2019 BASED ON OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  INCREASE (DECREASE)  SALARIES AND STAFF COSTS  $403,888  $402,068  $1,820  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  110,081  395,709  (285,628  )  CLINICAL TRIALS, OUTSIDE SERVICES, AND LAB SUPPLIES  1,927,929  849,988  1,077,941  FACILITIES AND OTHER  206,701  236,073  (29,372  )  TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  $2,648,599  $1,883,838  $764,761  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  INCREASE  D BY  $764,761  TO  $2,648,599  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  FROM  $1,883,838  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . THE OVERALL INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASED CLINICAL TRIALS AND OUTSIDE SERVICE COSTS FOR CLINICAL STUDIES RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR LEAD DRUG CANDIDATE, ONVANSERTIB. WE EXPECT AN INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS WE ADVANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ONVANSERTIB.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  INCREASE (DECREASE)  SALARIES AND STAFF COSTS  $522,797  $690,170  $(167,373  )  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  89,986  970,791  (880,805  )  OUTSIDE SERVICES AND PROFESSIONAL FEES  457,832  482,410  (24,578  )  FACILITIES AND OTHER  404,507  361,606  42,901  TOTAL SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  $1,475,122  $2,504,977  $(1,029,855  )  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  DECREASE  D BY  $1,029,855  TO  $1,475,122  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  FROM  $2,504,977  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . THE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF THE DECREASE WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN SALARIES AND STAFF COSTS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. THE DECREASED SALARIES AND STAFF COST WAS DUE TO THE DECREASED HEADCOUNT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018. IN JANUARY 2018, WE GRANTED OUR EMPLOYEES STOCK OPTIONS IN LIEU OF CASH BONUS. THESE IMMEDIATELY VESTED STOCK OPTIONS WERE FULLY EXPENSED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018. WE DID NOT GRANT SIMILAR STOCK OPTION BONUS IN 2019. THEREFORE, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES WERE HIGHER FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF  2019  . ALSO, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, A NON-CASH EXPENSE, WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF OPTIONS GRANTED, FORFEITURES AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTIONS AT THE TIME OF GRANT. OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS MAY INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS IN ORDER TO SUPPORT FUNDRAISING ACTIVITIES AND GENERAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AS WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE  INTEREST INCOME WAS  $64,743  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $21,771  FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF  2018  . THE INCREASE OF INTEREST INCOME IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER MONEY MARKET FUND BALANCE AND HIGHER INTEREST RATE. INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $0  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $24,236  FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF  2018  . THE DECREASE OF INTEREST EXPENSE IS RESULTING FROM PAY-OFF OF OUR EQUIPMENT LINE OF CREDIT.  CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  \u2014  WARRANTS  WE HAVE ISSUED WARRANTS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  \u2014  WARRANTS LIABILITIES WERE REVALUED TO  $42,076  , RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN VALUE OF  $9,761  FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , BASED PRIMARILY UPON THE INCREASE IN OUR STOCK PRICE AS WELL AS THE CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED TERM, VOLATILITY, AND RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES FOR THE EXPECTED TERM. THE INCREASE IN VALUE UPON REMEASUREMENT AT  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS RECORDED AS A LOSS FROM THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  \u2014  WARRANTS IN THE CONDENSED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  NET LOSS  NET LOSS AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  INCREASE (DECREASE)  NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS  $(4,179,100  )  $(4,792,237  )  $(613,137  )  NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE \u2014 BASIC  $(1.02  )  $(6.23  )  $(5.21  )  NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE \u2014 DILUTED  $(1.02  )  $(6.23  )  $(5.21  )  WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING \u2014 BASIC  4,086,561  768,951  3,317,610  WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING \u2014 DILUTED  4,086,561  768,951  3,317,610  THE  $613,137  DECREASE  IN NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES OF  $0.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE  $5.21  DECREASE IN BASIC NET LOSS PER SHARE WAS IMPACTED BY THE DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSE AND THE INCREASE IN BASIC WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM THE SALES OF APPROXIMATELY 1.7 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH PUBLIC AND DIRECT OFFERINGS, THE ISSUANCE OF APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UPON CONVERSION OF SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, AND ISSUANCE OF APPROXIMATELY 0.5 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UPON EXERCISE OF WARRANTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  $11,330,079  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  $3,360,046  , COMPARED TO  $2,856,147  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . OUR USE OF CASH WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF THE NET LOSS OF  $3,904,771  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION OF  $200,067  , DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF  $45,911  , RELEASE OF CLINICAL TRIAL FUNDING COMMITMENT OF  $70,487  , AND THE LOSS FROM THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  \u2014  WARRANTS OF  $9,761  . THE CHANGES IN OUR OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONSISTED OF HIGHER ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND UNBILLED RECEIVABLE, PREPAID EXPENSES, OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS, AND OTHER ASSET, AND A DECREASE IN OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES. AT OUR CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED LEVEL OF OPERATING LOSS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR AN OPERATING CASH OUTFLOW FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $5,274  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $5,100  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , BOTH OF WHICH WERE FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  NET CASH PROVIDED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $3,242,266  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $1,292,641  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . NET CASH PROVIDED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE PRIMARILY FROM THE EXERCISE OF WARRANTS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL OF  $9,051,750  AND  $9,799,947  , RESPECTIVELY.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BASED ON OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PLAN AND ASSUMPTIONS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO FURTHER ADVANCE OUR CLINICAL TRIAL PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT OUR OTHER OPERATIONS. CONSIDERING OUR CURRENT CASH RESOURCES, WE BELIEVE OUR EXISTING RESOURCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR PLANNED OPERATIONS INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE BASED OUR CASH SUFFICIENCY ESTIMATES ON OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PLAN AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY PROVE TO BE WRONG. WE COULD UTILIZE OUR AVAILABLE CAPITAL RESOURCES SOONER THAN WE CURRENTLY EXPECT, AND WE COULD NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS EVEN SOONER THAN CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED.  THESE CIRCUMSTANCES RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND UPON NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE NATURE, COST AND TIMING OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. TO DATE, OUR SOURCES OF CASH HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY LIMITED TO THE SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY ISSUING EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DILUTION. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL WHEN REQUIRED OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY HAVE TO SIGNIFICANTLY DELAY, SCALE BACK OR DISCONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT AND/OR COMMERCIALIZATION OF ONE OR MORE PRODUCT CANDIDATES, ALL OF WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS. WE MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO (I) SEEK COLLABORATORS FOR PRODUCT CANDIDATES AT AN EARLIER STAGE THAN OTHERWISE WOULD BE DESIRABLE AND ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN MIGHT OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE; OR (II) RELINQUISH OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF RIGHTS TO TECHNOLOGIES, PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR PRODUCTS THAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE SEEK TO DEVELOP OR COMMERCIALIZE OURSELVES ON UNFAVORABLE TERMS. WE ARE EVALUATING ALL OPTIONS TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, INCREASE REVENUE, AS WELL AS REDUCE COSTS, IN AN EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION, WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: (1) RAISING CAPITAL THROUGH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EQUITY OFFERINGS; (2) INTRODUCING OPERATION AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES TO BRING IN NEW REVENUE STREAMS; (3) REDUCING OPERATING COSTS BY IDENTIFYING INTERNAL SYNERGIES; OR (4) ENGAGING IN STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS. WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS OUR SPENDING PLANS TO EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY ADDRESS OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

ALSO SEE \u201cSTATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d PRECEDING PART I.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO.  OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS ORGANIZED AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  OVERVIEW  \u2022  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  \u2022  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE  \u2022  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \u2022  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  \u2022  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  \u2022  SKILLED NURSING FACILITY REIMBURSEMENT RATES  \u2022  OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  \u2022  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  OVERVIEW  WE OPERATE AS A SELF-ADMINISTERED, SELF-MANAGED REIT THAT, THROUGH OUR SUBSIDIARIES, OWNS AND INVESTS IN REAL ESTATE SERVING THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY.  OUR PRIMARY BUSINESS CONSISTS OF ACQUIRING, FINANCING AND OWNING REAL ESTATE PROPERTY TO BE LEASED TO THIRD PARTY TENANTS IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR. WE PRIMARILY GENERATE REVENUES BY LEASING PROPERTIES TO TENANTS AND OWNING PROPERTIES OPERATED BY THIRD-PARTY PROPERTY MANAGERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES (\u201cU.S.\u201d) AND CANADA.  OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF SKILLED NURSING/TRANSITIONAL CARE FACILITIES, SENIOR HOUSING COMMUNITIES AND SPECIALTY HOSPITALS AND OTHER FACILITIES, IN EACH CASE LEASED TO THIRD-PARTY OPERATORS; SENIOR HOUSING COMMUNITIES OPERATED BY THIRD-PARTY PROPERTY MANAGERS PURSUANT TO PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS (\u201cSENIOR HOUSING - MANAGED\u201d); INVESTMENTS IN LOANS RECEIVABLE; PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND AN INVESTMENT IN AN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE.  IN 2017 AND 2018, WE COMPLETED A SERIES OF TRANSACTIONS\u2014INCLUDING OUR MERGER WITH CCP (\u201cCCP MERGER\u201d), SALES OF 67 FACILITIES LEASED TO GENESIS HEALTHCARE, INC., INVESTMENT IN AN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE WITH ENLIVANT AND TPG REAL ESTATE (\u201cENLIVANT JOINT VENTURE\u201d) AND ENTRY INTO OUR NEW CREDIT FACILITY (AS DEFINED BELOW)\u2014THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED OUR SCALE AND INCREASED OUR DIVERSIFICATION. ADDITIONALLY, SABRA HAS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED THE REPOSITIONING OF THE CCP PORTFOLIO, WHICH INCLUDED A COMBINATION OF LEASE MODIFICATIONS, WORKING CAPITAL ADVANCES, TRANSITIONING FACILITIES TO OTHER SABRA TENANTS AND STRATEGIC SALES OR CLOSURES OF UNDERPERFORMING FACILITIES (INCLUDING THE SALES OF SENIOR CARE CENTERS FACILITIES DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER \u201c\u2014DISPOSITIONS\u201d).  FOLLOWING THESE TRANSACTIONS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WHILE DIVERSIFYING OUR PORTFOLIO BY TENANT, FACILITY TYPE AND GEOGRAPHY WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR. WE PLAN TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES PRIMARILY THROUGH MAKING INVESTMENTS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE, INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF PURPOSE BUILT HEALTHCARE FACILITIES WITH SELECT DEVELOPERS. WE ALSO INTEND TO ACHIEVE OUR OBJECTIVE OF DIVERSIFYING OUR PORTFOLIO BY TENANT AND FACILITY TYPE THROUGH SELECT ASSET SALES AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS WITH OUR TENANTS.  WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF ASSISTED LIVING, INDEPENDENT LIVING AND MEMORY CARE COMMUNITIES IN THE U.S. AND CANADA AND THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF SKILLED NURSING/TRANSITIONAL CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FACILITIES IN THE U.S. WE HAVE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO OPPORTUNISTICALLY ACQUIRE OTHER TYPES OF HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE, ORIGINATE FINANCING SECURED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BY HEALTHCARE FACILITIES AND INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SENIOR HOUSING COMMUNITIES AND SKILLED NURSING/TRANSITIONAL CARE FACILITIES. WE ALSO EXPECT TO EXPAND OUR PORTFOLIO THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF PURPOSE-BUILT HEALTHCARE FACILITIES THROUGH PIPELINE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS WITH SELECT DEVELOPERS. WE FURTHER EXPECT TO WORK WITH EXISTING OPERATORS TO IDENTIFY STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES. THESE OPPORTUNITIES MAY INVOLVE REPLACING, RENOVATING OR EXPANDING FACILITIES IN OUR PORTFOLIO THAT MAY HAVE BECOME LESS COMPETITIVE AND NEW DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT PRESENT ATTRACTIVE RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS. IN ADDITION TO PURSUING ACQUISITIONS WITH TRIPLE-NET LEASES, WE EXPECT  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE OTHER FORMS OF INVESTMENT, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN SENIOR HOUSING - MANAGED COMMUNITIES, MEZZANINE AND SECURED DEBT INVESTMENTS, AND JOINT VENTURES FOR SENIOR HOUSING COMMUNITIES AND SKILLED NURSING/TRANSITIONAL CARE FACILITIES. WE ALSO EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE THE STRENGTH OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO BY SELECTIVELY DISPOSING OF UNDERPERFORMING FACILITIES OR WORKING WITH NEW OR EXISTING OPERATORS TO TRANSFER UNDERPERFORMING BUT PROMISING PROPERTIES TO NEW OPERATORS.  WITH RESPECT TO OUR DEBT AND PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS, IN GENERAL, WE ORIGINATE LOANS AND MAKE PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS WHEN AN ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY IS PRESENTED AND (A) THE PROPERTY IS IN OR NEAR THE DEVELOPMENT PHASE, (B) THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPERTY IS COMPLETED BUT THE OPERATIONS OF THE FACILITY ARE NOT YET STABILIZED OR (C) THE LOAN INVESTMENT WILL PROVIDE CAPITAL TO EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS. A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY RELATED TO LOAN ORIGINATIONS AND PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS IS HAVING THE OPTION TO PURCHASE THE UNDERLYING REAL ESTATE THAT IS OWNED BY OUR BORROWERS (AND THAT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY SECURES OUR LOAN INVESTMENTS) OR BY THE ENTITY IN WHICH WE HAVE AN INVESTMENT. THESE OPTIONS BECOME EXERCISABLE UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF VARIOUS CRITERIA, SUCH AS THE PASSAGE OF TIME OR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN OPERATING GOALS, AND THE METHOD TO DETERMINE THE PURCHASE PRICE UPON EXERCISE OF THE OPTION IS SET IN ADVANCE BASED ON THE SAME VALUATION METHODS WE USE TO VALUE OUR INVESTMENTS IN HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE. THIS PROPRIETARY DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE STRATEGY ALLOWS US TO DIVERSIFY OUR REVENUE STREAMS AND BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OPERATORS AND DEVELOPERS, AND PROVIDES US WITH THE OPTION TO ADD NEW PROPERTIES TO OUR EXISTING REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO IF WE DETERMINE THAT THOSE PROPERTIES ENHANCE OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND STOCKHOLDER VALUE AT THE TIME THE OPTIONS ARE EXERCISABLE.  WE EMPLOY A DISCIPLINED, OPPORTUNISTIC APPROACH IN OUR HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT STRATEGY BY INVESTING IN ASSETS THAT PROVIDE ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIVIDEND GROWTH AND APPRECIATION OF ASSET VALUES, WHILE MAINTAINING BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH AND LIQUIDITY, THEREBY CREATING LONG-TERM STOCKHOLDER VALUE.  WE ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A REIT WITH THE FILING OF OUR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN FOR THE TAXABLE YEAR BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2011. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED AND HAVE OPERATED, AND WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE, IN A MANNER TO QUALIFY AS A REIT. WE OPERATE THROUGH AN UMBRELLA PARTNERSHIP, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS AN UPREIT STRUCTURE, IN WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PROPERTIES AND ASSETS ARE HELD BY SABRA HEALTH CARE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, A DELAWARE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP (THE \u201cOPERATING PARTNERSHIP\u201d), OF WHICH WE ARE THE SOLE GENERAL PARTNER AND A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF OURS IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY LIMITED PARTNER, OR BY SUBSIDIARIES OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  DISPOSITIONS  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF  THREE  SKILLED NURSING/TRANSITIONAL CARE FACILITIES FOR AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION, NET OF CLOSING COSTS, OF  $6.9 MILLION  . THE NET CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THESE FACILITIES WAS  $8.4 MILLION  , WHICH RESULTED IN AN AGGREGATE  $1.5 MILLION  NET LOSS ON SALE.  IN ADDITION, SUBSEQUENT TO THE NOTICES OF DEFAULT AND LEASE TERMINATION WE ISSUED TO SENIOR CARE CENTERS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, ON DECEMBER 5, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (AS AMENDED IN JANUARY 2019) TO SELL  26  SKILLED NURSING/TRANSITIONAL CARE FACILITIES AND  TWO  SENIOR HOUSING COMMUNITIES OPERATED BY SENIOR CARE CENTERS FOR AN AGGREGATE SALES PRICE OF  $282.5 MILLION  . IN ADDITION, ON FEBRUARY 15, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH SENIOR CARE CENTERS WHICH, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ORDER ENTERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT IN MARCH 2019, PROVIDES FOR THE DISCHARGE OF OUR CLAIMS AGAINST SENIOR CARE CENTERS IN EXCHANGE FOR  $9.5 MILLION  OF SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS, A PORTION OF WHICH WOULD BE APPLIED TO PAY POST-PETITION RENT. WE RECORDED SUCH POST-PETITION RENT TOTALING  $5.7 MILLION  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND EXPECT TO RECORD AN ADDITIONAL  $0.5 MILLION  OF POST-PETITION RENT DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019. ON APRIL 1, 2019, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF THE  28  FACILITIES AND RECEIVED GROSS SALES PROCEEDS OF  $282.5 MILLION  AS WELL AS  $5.0 MILLION  OF THE SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS (WITH THE REMAINING  $4.5 MILLION  OF SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS PAYABLE ON OR BEFORE JULY 1, 2019). IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY THE BUYER FROM CERTAIN COSTS, EXPENSES AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE HISTORICAL OPERATIONS OF THE FACILITIES BY SENIOR CARE CENTERS. OF THE  10  REMAINING FACILITIES OPERATED BY SENIOR CARE CENTERS, WE EXPECT TO RE-TENANT  SEVEN  FACILITIES TO A CURRENT OPERATOR IN THE SABRA PORTFOLIO AND TO SELL  THREE  FACILITIES. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF  $92.2 MILLION  RELATED TO THE SENIOR CARE CENTERS FACILITIES, WHICH INCLUDES  $10.2 MILLION  RELATED TO OUR ESTIMATED CONTRACTUAL INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS.  HOLIDAY  ON DECEMBER 19, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A LETTER OF INTENT TO TERMINATE OUR TRIPLE-NET MASTER LEASE WITH HOLIDAY RETIREMENT (\u201cHOLIDAY\u201d) WITH RESPECT TO ALL  21  SENIOR HOUSING COMMUNITIES SUBJECT TO THE MASTER LEASE (THE \u201cHOLIDAY COMMUNITIES\u201d) AND CONCURRENTLY ENTER INTO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS PURSUANT TO WHICH HOLIDAY WOULD MANAGE THE HOLIDAY COMMUNITIES. ON APRIL 1, 2019, WE COMPLETED THE CONVERSION OF THE HOLIDAY COMMUNITIES TO OUR SENIOR HOUSING - MANAGED PORTFOLIO. IN EXCHANGE FOR TERMINATING THE HOLIDAY MASTER LEASE, WE RECEIVED  $57.2 MILLION  OF TOTAL CASH CONSIDERATION.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AT-THE-MARKET COMMON STOCK OFFERING PROGRAM  ON FEBRUARY 25, 2019, WE ESTABLISHED THE  $500.0 MILLION  ATM PROGRAM (AS DEFINED BELOW).  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SEC. THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. THESE JUDGMENTS AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND OUR DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATES OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS. WITH DIFFERENT ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS, MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS COULD BE REPORTED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, OTHER COMPANIES MAY UTILIZE DIFFERENT ESTIMATES THAT MAY IMPACT THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO THOSE OF COMPANIES IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES. A DISCUSSION OF THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS CRITICAL IN THAT THEY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS, REQUIRE ESTIMATES ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS IS INCLUDED IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FILED WITH THE SEC. EXCEPT FOR THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-02, LEASES, AS AMENDED BY SUBSEQUENT ASUS, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2, \u201cSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,\u201d IN THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE  SEE NOTE 2, \u201cSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,\u201d IN THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATES.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDED  437  REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT,  30  ASSETS HELD FOR SALE,  ONE  INVESTMENT IN A DIRECT FINANCING LEASE,  20  INVESTMENTS IN LOANS RECEIVABLE,  9  PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND  ONE  INVESTMENT IN AN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2018  , OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDED  515  REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT,  FIVE  ASSETS HELD FOR SALE,  ONE  INVESTMENT IN A DIRECT FINANCING LEASE,  21  INVESTMENTS IN LOANS RECEIVABLE,  13  PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND  ONE  INVESTMENT IN AN UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE. IN GENERAL, WE EXPECT THAT INCOME AND EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR PORTFOLIO WILL FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS IN COMPARISON TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR PERIODS AS A RESULT OF INVESTMENT AND DISPOSITION ACTIVITY AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE CHANGES IN OUR PORTFOLIO. THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS PRESENTED ARE NOT DIRECTLY COMPARABLE DUE TO ONGOING ACQUISITION AND DISPOSITION ACTIVITY.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  VERSUS THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).

(2)  REPRESENTS THE DOLLAR AMOUNT INCREASE (DECREASE) FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  THAT IS NOT A DIRECT RESULT OF INVESTMENTS/DISPOSITIONS MADE AFTER  JANUARY 1, 2018.  RENTAL AND RELATED REVENUES  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECOGNIZED  $116.4 MILLION  OF RENTAL INCOME COMPARED TO  $144.3 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE  $27.9 MILLION  NET DECREASE IN RENTAL INCOME IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF $9.5 MILLION FROM PROPERTIES DISPOSED OF AFTER  JANUARY 1, 2018  , A $10.3 MILLION DECREASE RELATED TO THE SENIOR CARE CENTERS FACILITIES, REFLECTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RECOGNIZING FULL RENT DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 COMPARED TO $5.7 MILLION OF POST-PETITION RENT DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, AND A $11.8 MILLION DECREASE PRIMARILY RELATED TO LEASES THAT WE CONCLUDED SHOULD NO LONGER BE ACCOUNTED FOR ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-02, LEASES, AS AMENDED BY SUBSEQUENT ASUS (\u201cTOPIC 842\u201d).  THE $11.8 MILLION DECREASE CONSISTS OF A $4.4 MILLION DECREASE IN EARNED CASH RENTS, A $2.2 MILLION DECREASE IN STRAIGHT-LINE RENTAL INCOME AND A $5.2 MILLION NET DECREASE DUE TO THE ACCELERATION OF ABOVE/BELOW MARKET LEASE INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION. THESE AMOUNTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $2.1 MILLION FROM PROPERTIES ACQUIRED AFTER  JANUARY 1, 2018  AND A $4.2 MILLION INCREASE RELATED TO PROPERTY TAX RECOVERIES DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842, WHICH NOW REQUIRES LESSOR COSTS THAT ARE PAID BY THE LESSOR AND REIMBURSED BY THE LESSEE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF VARIABLE LEASE REVENUE AND THE ASSOCIATED EXPENSE. OUR REPORTED RENTAL AND RELATED REVENUES MAY BE SUBJECT TO INCREASED VARIABILITY IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING TOPIC 842 AND WE EXPECT 2019 RENTAL AND RELATED REVENUES TO INCREASE COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AS CASH PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED FOR THESE LEASES THAT ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES REGARDING THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THESE COLLECTIONS. AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE TERMS OF ALL OF OUR LEASE AGREEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO CONTRACTUAL INCREASES, AND CONTINGENT RENTAL INCOME MAY BE DERIVED FROM CERTAIN LEASE AGREEMENTS. NO MATERIAL CONTINGENT RENTAL INCOME WAS DERIVED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF INCOME EARNED ON OUR LOANS RECEIVABLE INVESTMENTS, PREFERRED RETURNS EARNED ON OUR PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND INCOME ON THE DIRECT FINANCING LEASE. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECOGNIZED  $3.3 MILLION  OF INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME COMPARED TO  $4.3 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE NET DECREASE OF  $1.0 MILLION  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF $1.8 MILLION FROM INVESTMENTS THAT WERE REPAID AFTER  JANUARY 1, 2018  , INCLUDING THE SPECIALTY VALUATION FIRM ACQUIRED IN THE CCP MERGER THAT WE SOLD IN MARCH 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $0.5 MILLION RELATED TO INTEREST INCOME FROM LOANS RECEIVABLE INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED AFTER  JANUARY 1, 2018  .  THE REMAINING INCREASE IS DUE TO INCOME ON ADDITIONAL FUNDINGS FOR LOANS RECEIVABLE INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED BEFORE  JANUARY 1, 2018.  RESIDENT FEES AND SERVICES  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECOGNIZED  $17.1 MILLION  OF RESIDENT FEES AND SERVICES COMPARED TO  $17.5 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE  $0.4 MILLION  DECREASE IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO ONE SENIOR HOUSING - MANAGED COMMUNITY DISPOSED OF AFTER  JANUARY 1, 2018.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE INCURRED  $44.9 MILLION  OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE COMPARED TO  $48.0 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE  $3.1 MILLION  NET DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $2.9 MILLION DECREASE FROM PROPERTIES DISPOSED OF AFTER  JANUARY 1, 2018  AND A $0.9 MILLION DECREASE RELATED TO ASSETS THAT HAVE BEEN FULLY DEPRECIATED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $0.7 MILLION FROM PROPERTIES ACQUIRED AFTER  JANUARY 1, 2018.  INTEREST EXPENSE  WE INCUR INTEREST EXPENSE COMPRISED OF COSTS OF BORROWINGS PLUS THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE INCURRED  $36.3 MILLION  OF INTEREST EXPENSE COMPARED TO  $35.8 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE  $0.5 MILLION  NET INCREASE IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO (I) A $1.2 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (AS DEFINED BELOW) AND (II) A $0.6 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO OUR U.S. DOLLAR TERM LOANS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $1.3 MILLION DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO OUR SECURED BORROWINGS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REPAYMENT OF FIVE MORTGAGE NOTES DURING 2018.  TRIPLE-NET PORTFOLIO OPERATING EXPENSES  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECOGNIZED  $5.3 MILLION  OF TRIPLE-NET PORTFOLIO OPERATING EXPENSES, OF WHICH $4.2 MILLION IS DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842, WHICH NOW REQUIRES LESSOR COSTS THAT ARE PAID BY THE LESSOR AND REIMBURSED BY THE LESSEE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF VARIABLE LEASE REVENUE AND THE ASSOCIATED EXPENSE AND THE REMAINING $1.1 MILLION IS PRIMARILY DUE TO PROPERTY TAXES THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE REIMBURSED BY OUR TENANTS.  SENIOR HOUSING - MANAGED PORTFOLIO OPERATING EXPENSES  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECOGNIZED  $12.0 MILLION  OF SENIOR HOUSING - MANAGED PORTFOLIO OPERATING EXPENSES COMPARED TO  $12.1 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDE COMPENSATION-RELATED EXPENSES AS WELL AS PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, OFFICE COSTS AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ASSET MANAGEMENT. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  $8.2 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $7.9 MILLION  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE  $0.3 MILLION  NET INCREASE IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A $1.6 MILLION INCREASE IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $0.5 MILLION DECREASE IN TRANSITION EXPENSES FOR THE CCP MERGER AND A $0.8 MILLION DECREASE IN EXPENSES INCURRED BY OUR SPECIALTY VALUATION FIRM THAT WE SOLD IN MARCH 2018.  THE INCREASE IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, FROM $1.1 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  TO $2.8 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A CHANGE IN PERFORMANCE-BASED VESTING ASSUMPTIONS ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S EQUITY COMPENSATION.  MERGER AND ACQUISITION COSTS  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE INCURRED  $6,000  OF MERGER AND ACQUISITION COSTS COMPARED TO  $0.3 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THE COSTS INCURRED IN BOTH PERIODS WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE CCP  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MERGER. WE EXPECT EXPENSED MERGER AND ACQUISITION COSTS TO FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DEPENDING ON ACQUISITION ACTIVITY AND WHETHER THESE ACQUISITIONS ARE CONSIDERED BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.  PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, STRAIGHT-LINE RENTAL INCOME AND LOAN LOSSES  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECOGNIZED A  $1.2 MILLION  PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, STRAIGHT-LINE RENTAL INCOME AND LOAN LOSSES, ALL OF WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOAN LOSS RESERVES. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , WE RECOGNIZED A  $1.2 MILLION  PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, STRAIGHT-LINE RENTAL INCOME AND LOAN LOSSES, WHICH WAS COMPRISED OF A $2.1 MILLION INCREASE IN RESERVES ON STRAIGHT-LINE RENTAL INCOME AND A $0.1 MILLION INCREASE IN LOAN LOSS RESERVES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $1.0 DECREASE IN RESERVES ON CASH RENTAL INCOME.  IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECOGNIZED  $103.1 MILLION  OF IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE, CONSISTING OF (I)  $92.2 MILLION  RELATED TO THE SENIOR CARE CENTERS PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING THE 28 FACILITIES SOLD ON APRIL 1, 2019, AND WHICH INCLUDES  $10.2 MILLION  RELATED TO OUR ESTIMATED CONTRACTUAL INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS, AND (II)  $10.9 MILLION  RELATED TO  FOUR  ADDITIONAL SKILLED NURSING/TRANSITIONAL CARE FACILITIES. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , WE RECOGNIZED  $0.5 MILLION  OF IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE RELATED TO ONE SKILLED NURSING/TRANSITION CARE FACILITY.  OTHER INCOME  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECOGNIZED  $0.2 MILLION  OF OTHER INCOME DUE TO A SETTLEMENT PAYMENT RECEIVED RELATED TO A LEGACY CCP INVESTMENT. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , WE RECOGNIZED  $2.8 MILLION  OF OTHER INCOME, WHICH IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF (I) A $2.0 MILLION CONTINGENCY FEE RELATED TO A LEGACY CCP INVESTMENT, (II) $0.6 MILLION RELATED TO CASH PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM TWO FACILITIES NOT SUBJECT TO A LEASE AND (III) $0.2 MILLION RELATED TO THE SALE OF OUR SPECIALTY VALUATION FIRM.  NET LOSS ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECOGNIZED AN AGGREGATE NET LOSS ON THE SALES OF REAL ESTATE OF $1.5 MILLION  RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION OF  THREE  SKILLED NURSING/TRANSITIONAL CARE FACILITIES. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , WE RECOGNIZED A NET LOSS ON THE SALE OF REAL ESTATE OF  $0.5 MILLION  RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION OF ONE SKILLED NURSING/TRANSITIONAL CARE FACILITY.  (LOSS) INCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECOGNIZED  $1.4 MILLION  OF LOSS FROM THE ENLIVANT JOINT VENTURE. INCLUDED IN THE LOSS IS $2.6 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COST BASIS IN THE ENLIVANT JOINT VENTURE AND THE BASIS REFLECTED AT THE JOINT VENTURE LEVEL AND $0.4 MILLION OF DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , WE RECOGNIZED  $0.4 MILLION  OF INCOME FROM THE ENLIVANT JOINT VENTURE. THIS  $0.4 MILLION  OF INCOME IS NET OF $1.8 MILLION OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COST BASIS IN THE ENLIVANT JOINT VENTURE AND THE BASIS REFLECTED AT THE JOINT VENTURE LEVEL AND $0.6 MILLION OF DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECOGNIZED  $0.6 MILLION  OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE COMPARED TO  $0.5 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AND ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS  WE BELIEVE THAT NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AS DEFINED BY GAAP IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE EARNINGS MEASURE. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS (\u201cFFO\u201d), AS DEFINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DEFINITION USED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\u201cNAREIT\u201d), AND ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS (\u201cAFFO\u201d) (AND RELATED PER SHARE AMOUNTS) ARE IMPORTANT NON-GAAP SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. BECAUSE THE HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING CONVENTION USED FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS REQUIRES STRAIGHT-LINE DEPRECIATION (EXCEPT ON LAND), SUCH ACCOUNTING PRESENTATION IMPLIES THAT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS DIMINISHES PREDICTABLY OVER TIME. HOWEVER, SINCE REAL ESTATE VALUES HAVE HISTORICALLY RISEN OR FALLEN WITH MARKET AND OTHER CONDITIONS, PRESENTATIONS OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR A REIT THAT USES HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING FOR DEPRECIATION COULD BE LESS INFORMATIVE. THUS, NAREIT CREATED FFO AS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR REITS THAT EXCLUDES HISTORICAL COST DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, FROM NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS, AS DEFINED BY GAAP. FFO IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS, COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, EXCLUDING GAINS OR LOSSES FROM REAL ESTATE DISPOSITIONS, PLUS REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, NET OF AMOUNTS RELATED TO  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, PLUS OUR SHARE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION RELATED TO OUR UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE, AND REAL ESTATE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. AFFO IS DEFINED AS FFO EXCLUDING MERGER AND ACQUISITION COSTS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, STRAIGHT-LINE RENTAL INCOME ADJUSTMENTS, AMORTIZATION OF ABOVE AND BELOW MARKET LEASE INTANGIBLES, NON-CASH INTEREST INCOME ADJUSTMENTS, NON-CASH INTEREST EXPENSE, CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, NON-CASH PORTION OF LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL STRAIGHT-LINE RENTAL INCOME, LOAN LOSSES AND OTHER RESERVES AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES, AS WELL AS OTHER NON-CASH REVENUE AND EXPENSE ITEMS (INCLUDING INEFFECTIVENESS GAIN/LOSS ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, AND NON-CASH REVENUE AND EXPENSE AMOUNTS RELATED TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS) AND OUR SHARE OF NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO OUR UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE USE OF FFO AND AFFO (AND THE RELATED PER SHARE AMOUNTS), COMBINED WITH THE REQUIRED GAAP PRESENTATIONS, IMPROVES THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS AMONG INVESTORS AND MAKES COMPARISONS OF OPERATING RESULTS AMONG REITS MORE MEANINGFUL. WE CONSIDER FFO AND AFFO TO BE USEFUL MEASURES FOR REVIEWING COMPARATIVE OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BECAUSE, BY EXCLUDING THE APPLICABLE ITEMS LISTED ABOVE, FFO AND AFFO CAN HELP INVESTORS COMPARE OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE BETWEEN PERIODS OR AS COMPARED TO OTHER COMPANIES. WHILE FFO AND AFFO ARE RELEVANT AND WIDELY USED MEASURES OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF REITS, THEY DO NOT REPRESENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OR NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AS DEFINED BY GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO THOSE MEASURES IN EVALUATING OUR LIQUIDITY OR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. FFO AND AFFO ALSO DO NOT CONSIDER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO OUR REAL ESTATE ASSETS NOR DO THEY PURPORT TO BE INDICATIVE OF CASH AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS. FURTHER, OUR COMPUTATION OF FFO AND AFFO MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO FFO AND AFFO REPORTED BY OTHER REITS THAT DO NOT DEFINE FFO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CURRENT NAREIT DEFINITION OR THAT INTERPRET THE CURRENT NAREIT DEFINITION OR DEFINE AFFO DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  $402.6 MILLION  IN LIQUIDITY, CONSISTING OF UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $22.6 MILLION  (EXCLUDING JOINT VENTURE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS), AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OF  $380.0 MILLION  . THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS AN ACCORDION FEATURE THAT CAN INCREASE THE TOTAL AVAILABLE BORROWINGS TO  $2.5 BILLION  (FROM U.S. $2.1 BILLION PLUS CAD  $125.0 MILLION  ), SUBJECT TO TERMS AND CONDITIONS. SUBSEQUENT TO  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF THE 28 SENIOR CARE CENTERS FACILITIES, WHICH RESULTED IN NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $281.5 MILLION, AND WE RECEIVED A $57.2 MILLION LEASE TERMINATION PAYMENT FROM HOLIDAY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONVERSION OF THE HOLIDAY COMMUNITIES TO OUR SENIOR HOUSING - MANAGED PORTFOLIO. WE USED THE AGGREGATE $338.7 MILLION OF PROCEEDS TO REPAY BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  WE HAVE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SEC THAT EXPIRES IN JANUARY 2020, WHICH ALLOWS US TO OFFER AND SELL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK, WARRANTS, RIGHTS, UNITS, AND CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO OFFER AND SELL DEBT SECURITIES, THROUGH UNDERWRITERS, DEALERS OR AGENTS OR DIRECTLY TO PURCHASERS, ON A CONTINUOUS OR DELAYED BASIS, IN AMOUNTS, AT PRICES AND ON TERMS WE DETERMINE AT THE TIME OF THE OFFERING, SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS.  ON FEBRUARY 25, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT (THE \u201cDISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH A CONSORTIUM OF BANKS ACTING AS SALES AGENTS (THE \u201cSALES AGENTS\u201d) TO SELL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAVING AGGREGATE GROSS PROCEEDS OF UP TO  $500.0 MILLION  FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH THE SALES AGENTS (THE \u201cATM PROGRAM\u201d). WE SOLD NO SHARES UNDER THE ATM PROGRAM DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  $500.0 MILLION  AVAILABLE UNDER THE ATM PROGRAM. SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS, WE EXPECT TO USE PROCEEDS FROM OUR ATM PROGRAM TO REDUCE OUR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS AND TO FINANCE FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH, OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND BORROWINGS AVAILABLE TO US UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDS FOR OUR OPERATIONS, SCHEDULED DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS AND DIVIDEND REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. IN ADDITION, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE RESTRICTIONS UNDER OUR SENIOR NOTES INDENTURES (AS DEFINED BELOW) OR CREDIT FACILITY SIGNIFICANTLY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO USE OUR AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY FOR THESE PURPOSES.  WE INTEND TO INVEST IN ADDITIONAL HEALTHCARE PROPERTIES AS SUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES ARISE AND ADEQUATE SOURCES OF FINANCING ARE AVAILABLE. WE EXPECT THAT FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPROVEMENTS OR RENOVATIONS OF CURRENT OR NEWLY-ACQUIRED PROPERTIES, WILL DEPEND ON AND WILL BE FINANCED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BY OUR EXISTING CASH, BORROWINGS AVAILABLE TO US UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, FUTURE BORROWINGS OR THE PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF COMMON STOCK (INCLUDING THROUGH OUR ATM PROGRAM), PREFERRED STOCK, DEBT OR OTHER SECURITIES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY SEEK FINANCING FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, INCLUDING THROUGH FANNIE MAE AND HUD, IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS. WE ALSO USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS TO MITIGATE INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $54.0 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . OPERATING CASH INFLOWS WERE DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM THE RENTAL PAYMENTS RECEIVED UNDER OUR LEASE AGREEMENTS, RESIDENT FEES AND SERVICES NET OF THE CORRESPONDING OPERATING EXPENSES AND INTEREST PAYMENTS FROM BORROWERS UNDER OUR LOAN INVESTMENTS. OPERATING CASH OUTFLOWS CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF INTEREST PAYMENTS ON BORROWINGS AND PAYMENT OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING CORPORATE OVERHEAD. WE EXPECT OUR ANNUALIZED CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO FLUCTUATE AS A RESULT OF COMPLETED INVESTMENT AND DISPOSITION ACTIVITY AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE CHANGES IN OUR PORTFOLIO.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $6.3 MILLION  AND CONSISTED OF  $6.9 MILLION  IN SALES PROCEEDS RELATED TO THE DISPOSITION OF THREE REAL ESTATE FACILITIES,  $5.3 MILLION  IN REPAYMENTS OF LOANS RECEIVABLE AND  $2.1 MILLION  IN REPAYMENTS OF PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  $2.8 MILLION  USED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR EXISTING LOANS RECEIVABLE AND  $5.1 MILLION  USED FOR TENANT IMPROVEMENTS.  WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE USING AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY AND PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THE ATM PROGRAM TO FUND ANTICIPATED FUTURE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS, LOAN ORIGINATIONS, PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $87.5 MILLION  AND INCLUDED  $80.3 MILLION  OF DIVIDENDS PAID TO STOCKHOLDERS,  $0.8 MILLION  OF PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF SECURED DEBT AND  $2.3 MILLION  IN PAYROLL TAX PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO EQUITY COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS AS WELL AS EXPENSES WITH RESPECT TO ESTABLISHING THE ATM PROGRAM.

THERE ARE NO PRESENT PLANS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OR DEVELOPMENT OF ANY UNIMPROVED OR UNDEVELOPED PROPERTY; HOWEVER, FROM TIME TO TIME WE MAY AGREE TO FUND IMPROVEMENTS OUR TENANTS MAKE AT OUR FACILITIES. ACCORDINGLY, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR AGGREGATE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL NOT EXCEED  $63.0 MILLION  , AND THAT SUCH EXPENDITURES WILL PRINCIPALLY BE FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR FACILITIES AND RESULT IN INCREMENTAL RENTAL INCOME.  DIVIDENDS  WE PAID DIVIDENDS OF  $80.3 MILLION  ON OUR COMMON STOCK DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . ON  MAY 8, 2019  , OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF  $0.45  PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK. THE DIVIDEND WILL BE PAID ON  MAY 31, 2019  TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF  MAY 20, 2019.  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISE WHEN A NUMBER OF OPERATORS, TENANTS OR OBLIGORS RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENTS ARE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, OR ACTIVITIES IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC REGION, OR HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC FEATURES THAT WOULD CAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO MEET CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE TO US, TO BE SIMILARLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR OUR PORTFOLIO TO ASSESS POTENTIAL CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES OUR CURRENT PORTFOLIO IS REASONABLY DIVERSIFIED ACROSS HEALTHCARE RELATED REAL ESTATE AND GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY OTHER SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS. OUR PORTFOLIO OF  437  REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  IS DIVERSIFIED BY LOCATION ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  NO  TENANT RELATIONSHIP REPRESENTED 10% OR MORE OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES.  SKILLED NURSING FACILITY REIMBURSEMENT RATES  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  57.6%  OF OUR REVENUES WAS DERIVED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM SKILLED NURSING/TRANSITIONAL CARE FACILITIES. MEDICARE REIMBURSES SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES FOR MEDICARE PART A SERVICES UNDER THE PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEM (\u201cPPS\u201d), AS IMPLEMENTED PURSUANT TO THE BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997 AND MODIFIED PURSUANT TO SUBSEQUENT LAWS, MOST RECENTLY THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OF 2010. PPS REGULATIONS PREDETERMINE A PAYMENT AMOUNT PER PATIENT, PER DAY, BASED ON A MARKET BASKET INDEX CALCULATED FOR ALL COVERED COSTS. THE AMOUNT TO BE PAID IS DETERMINED BY CLASSIFYING EACH PATIENT INTO ONE OF 66 RESOURCE UTILIZATION GROUP (\u201cRUG\u201d) CATEGORIES THAT REPRESENT THE LEVEL OF SERVICES REQUIRED TO TREAT DIFFERENT CONDITIONS AND LEVELS OF ACUITY.  46  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF 66 RUG CATEGORIES, OR RESOURCE UTILIZATION GROUP, VERSION IV (\u201cRUG IV\u201d), BECAME EFFECTIVE AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2010. RUG IV RESULTED FROM RESEARCH PERFORMED BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES (\u201cCMS\u201d) AND WAS PART OF CMS\u2019S CONTINUING EFFORT TO INCREASE THE CORRELATION OF THE COST OF SERVICES TO THE CONDITION OF INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS.  ON JULY 31, 2018, CMS ISSUED A FINAL RULE, CMS-1696-F, WHICH INCLUDES CHANGES TO THE CASE-MIX CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM USED UNDER THE PPS AND FISCAL YEAR 2019 MEDICARE PAYMENT UPDATES.  CMS-1696-F INCLUDES A NEW CASE-MIX CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM CALLED THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY PATIENT-DRIVEN PAYMENT MODEL (\u201cPDPM\u201d) THAT WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE ON OCTOBER 1, 2019. PDPM REFLECTS SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE RESIDENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM, VERSION I (\u201cRCS-I\u201d) THAT WAS BEING CONSIDERED TO REPLACE RUG IV AS OUTLINED IN AN ADVANCED NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING RELEASED BY CMS IN MAY 2017.  PDPM FOCUSES ON CLINICALLY RELEVANT FACTORS, RATHER THAN VOLUME-BASED SERVICE, FOR DETERMINING MEDICARE PAYMENT. PDPM ADJUSTS MEDICARE PAYMENTS BASED ON EACH ASPECT OF A RESIDENT\u2019S CARE, MOST NOTABLY FOR NON-THERAPY ANCILLARIES, WHICH ARE ITEMS AND SERVICES NOT RELATED TO THE PROVISION OF THERAPY SUCH AS DRUGS AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES, THEREBY MORE ACCURATELY ADDRESSING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICALLY COMPLEX PATIENTS. IT FURTHER ADJUSTS THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY PER DIEM PAYMENTS TO REFLECT VARYING COSTS THROUGHOUT THE STAY AND INCORPORATES SAFEGUARDS AGAINST POTENTIAL FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO ENSURE THAT BENEFICIARIES RECEIVE CARE CONSISTENT WITH THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS AND GOALS.  BASED ON CHANGES CONTAINED WITHIN CMS-1696-F, CMS ESTIMATES THAT THE FISCAL YEAR 2019 AGGREGATE IMPACT WILL BE AN INCREASE OF $820 MILLION IN MEDICARE PAYMENTS TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES, RESULTING FROM THE FISCAL YEAR 2019 MARKET BASKET UPDATE REQUIRED TO BE 2.4% BY THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT OF 2018. ABSENT THE APPLICATION OF THIS STATUTORY REQUIREMENT, THE FISCAL YEAR 2019 MARKET BASKET UPDATE FACTOR WOULD HAVE BEEN 2.0% (COMPRISED OF A MARKET BASKET INDEX OF 2.8% LESS THE PRODUCTIVITY ADJUSTMENT OF 0.8%). THIS 2.0% UPDATE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN ESTIMATED AGGREGATE INCREASE OF $670 MILLION IN MEDICARE PAYMENTS TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. THE NEW PAYMENT RATES BECAME EFFECTIVE ON OCTOBER 1, 2018.  ON APRIL 19, 2019, CMS ISSUED A PROPOSED RULE, CMS-1718-P, WHICH INCLUDES UPDATING FISCAL YEAR 2020 MEDICARE RATES FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT CMS ESTIMATES WILL RESULT IN A NET INCREASE OF 2.5% OVER FISCAL YEAR 2019 PAYMENTS (COMPRISED OF A MARKET BASKET INDEX OF 3.0% LESS THE PRODUCTIVITY ADJUSTMENT OF 0.5%).

OPERATING SEGMENTS  OUR COMPANY IS COMPRISED OF THREE OPERATING SEGMENTS: COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS, CLIMATE SOLUTIONS AND POWER TRANSMISSION SOLUTIONS.  A DESCRIPTION OF THE THREE OPERATING SEGMENTS IS AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS PRODUCES MEDIUM AND LARGE MOTORS, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT, ALTERNATORS, MOTORS AND CONTROLS AND AIR MOVING SOLUTIONS. THESE PRODUCTS SERVE MARKETS INCLUDING COMMERCIAL HVAC, POOL AND SPA, STANDBY AND CRITICAL POWER AND OIL AND GAS SYSTEMS.  \u2022  CLIMATE SOLUTIONS PRODUCES SMALL MOTORS, CONTROLS AND AIR MOVING SOLUTIONS SERVING MARKETS INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL AND LIGHT COMMERCIAL HVAC, WATER HEATERS AND COMMERCIAL REFRIGERATION.  \u2022  POWER TRANSMISSION SOLUTIONS MANUFACTURES, SELLS AND SERVICES BELT AND CHAIN DRIVES, HELICAL AND WORM GEARING, MOUNTED AND UNMOUNTED BEARINGS, COUPLINGS, MODULAR PLASTIC BELTS, CONVEYING CHAINS AND COMPONENTS, HYDRAULIC PUMP DRIVES, LARGE OPEN GEARING AND SPECIALTY MECHANICAL PRODUCTS SERVING MARKETS INCLUDING BEVERAGE, BULK HANDLING, METALS, SPECIAL MACHINERY, ENERGY, AEROSPACE AND GENERAL INDUSTRIAL.  COMPONENTS OF PROFIT AND LOSS  NET SALES  . WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO A VARIETY OF MANUFACTURERS, DISTRIBUTORS AND END USERS. OUR CUSTOMERS CONSIST OF A LARGE CROSS-SECTION OF BUSINESSES, RANGING FROM FORTUNE 100 COMPANIES TO SMALL BUSINESSES. A NUMBER OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (\"OEM'S\"), WHO INCORPORATE OUR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS ELECTRIC MOTORS, INTO PRODUCTS THEY MANUFACTURE, AND MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE BUILT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR SALES DERIVE FROM DIRECT SALES, BUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION DERIVES FROM SALES MADE BY MANUFACTURER\u2019S REPRESENTATIVES, WHO ARE PAID EXCLUSIVELY ON COMMISSION. OUR PRODUCT SALES ARE MADE VIA PURCHASE ORDER, LONG-TERM CONTRACT, AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, ONE-TIME PURCHASES. MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS HAVE BROAD CUSTOMER BASES, WITH THE LEVELS OF CONCENTRATION OF REVENUES VARYING FROM BUSINESS UNIT TO BUSINESS UNIT.  OUR LEVEL OF NET SALES FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD IS DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING (I) THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS; (II) THE STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY GENERALLY AND THE END MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE; (III) OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PERCEPTIONS OF OUR PRODUCT QUALITY AT ANY GIVEN TIME; (IV) OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY MEET CUSTOMER DEMANDS; (V) THE SELLING PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS; AND (VI) THE WEATHER. AS A RESULT, OUR TOTAL REVENUE HAS TENDED TO EXPERIENCE QUARTERLY VARIATIONS AND OUR TOTAL REVENUE FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTER MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.  WE USE THE TERM \u201cORGANIC SALES\" TO REFER TO SALES FROM EXISTING OPERATIONS EXCLUDING (I) SALES FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES RECORDED PRIOR TO THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ACQUISITION (\u201cACQUISITION SALES\u201d), (II) LESS THE AMOUNT OF SALES ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY BUSINESSES DIVESTED/ TO BE EXITED (\"BUSINESS TO BE EXITED\"), AND (III) THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS DETERMINED BY TRANSLATING THE RESPECTIVE PERIOD\u2019S ORGANIC SALES USING THE SAME CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES THAT WERE IN EFFECT DURING THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. WE USE THE TERM \u201cORGANIC SALES GROWTH\u201d TO REFER TO THE INCREASE IN OUR SALES BETWEEN PERIODS THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ORGANIC SALES. WE USE THE TERM \u201cACQUISITION GROWTH\u201d TO REFER TO THE INCREASE IN OUR SALES BETWEEN PERIODS THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACQUISITION SALES.  GROSS PROFIT  . OUR GROSS PROFIT IS IMPACTED BY OUR LEVELS OF NET SALES AND COST OF SALES. OUR COST OF SALES CONSISTS OF COSTS FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS (I) RAW MATERIALS, INCLUDING COPPER, STEEL AND ALUMINUM; (II) COMPONENTS SUCH AS CASTINGS, BARS, TOOLS, BEARINGS AND ELECTRONICS; (III) WAGES AND RELATED PERSONNEL EXPENSES FOR FABRICATION, ASSEMBLY AND LOGISTICS PERSONNEL; (IV) MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, INCLUDING DEPRECIATION ON OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, INSURANCE AND UTILITIES; AND (V) SHIPPING. THE MAJORITY OF OUR COST OF SALES CONSISTS OF RAW MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS. THE PRICE WE PAY FOR COMMODITIES AND COMPONENTS CAN BE SUBJECT TO COMMODITY PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. WE ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THIS THROUGH FIXED-PRICE AGREEMENTS WITH SUPPLIERS AND OUR HEDGING STRATEGIES. WHEN WE EXPERIENCE COMMODITY PRICE INCREASES, WE HAVE TENDED TO ANNOUNCE PRICE INCREASE TO OUR CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASE VIA PURCHASE ORDER, WITH SUCH INCREASES GENERALLY TAKING EFFECT A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. FOR THOSE SALES WE MAKE UNDER LONG-TERM CONTRACTS, WE TEND TO INCLUDE MATERIAL PRICE FORMULAS THAT SPECIFY QUARTERLY OR SEMI-ANNUAL PRICE ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING COMMODITY PRICES.  OUTSIDE OF GENERAL ECONOMIC CYCLICALITY, OUR DIFFERENT BUSINESS UNITS EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF VARIATION IN GROSS PROFIT FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER BASED ON FACTORS SPECIFIC TO EACH BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, A PORTION OF OUR CLIMATE SOLUTIONS SEGMENT MANUFACTURES PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED IN AIR CONDITIONING APPLICATIONS. AS A RESULT, OUR SALES FOR THAT BUSINESS TEND TO BE LOWER IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH  34  QUARTERS AND HIGHER IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS. IN CONTRAST, OUR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS SEGMENT AND OUR POWER TRANSMISSION SOLUTIONS SEGMENT HAVE A BROAD CUSTOMER BASE AND A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS, THEREBY HELPING TO MITIGATE LARGE QUARTER-TO-QUARTER FLUCTUATIONS OUTSIDE OF GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  OPERATING EXPENSES  . OUR OPERATING EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF (I) GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES; (II) SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES; (III) GENERAL ENGINEERING AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES; AND (IV) HANDLING COSTS INCURRED IN CONJUNCTION WITH DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITIES. PERSONNEL RELATED COSTS ARE OUR LARGEST OPERATING EXPENSE.  OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COSTS FOR (I) SALARIES, BENEFITS AND OTHER PERSONNEL EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR EXECUTIVE, FINANCE, HUMAN RESOURCE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, LEGAL AND OPERATIONS FUNCTIONS; (II) OCCUPANCY EXPENSES; (III) TECHNOLOGY RELATED COSTS; (IV) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION; AND (V) CORPORATE-RELATED TRAVEL. THE MAJORITY OF OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE FOR SALARIES AND RELATED PERSONNEL EXPENSES. THESE COSTS CAN VARY BY BUSINESS GIVEN THE LOCATION OF OUR DIFFERENT MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS.  OUR SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COSTS FOR (I) SALARIES, BENEFITS AND OTHER PERSONNEL EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTION; (II) INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SALES COMMISSIONS AND BONUSES; (III) TRAVEL, LODGING AND OTHER OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SELLING EFFORTS; AND (IV) OTHER RELATED OVERHEAD.

OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS TEND TO BE TARGETED TOWARD DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO MAINTAIN OR GAIN ADDITIONAL MARKET SHARE, WHETHER IN NEW OR EXISTING APPLICATIONS. WHILE THESE COSTS MAKE UP AN INSIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE POWER TRANSMISSION SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, THEY ARE MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN OUR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS AND CLIMATE SOLUTIONS SEGMENTS. IN PARTICULAR, A LARGE DRIVER OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS IN THESE TWO SEGMENTS IS ENERGY EFFICIENCY, WHICH GENERALLY MEANS USING LESS ELECTRICAL POWER TO PRODUCE MORE MECHANICAL POWER.  OPERATING PROFIT  . OUR OPERATING PROFIT CONSISTS OF THE SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT LESS THE SEGMENT OPERATING EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE SHARED OPERATING COSTS THAT COVER CORPORATE, ENGINEERING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXPENSES THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE SEGMENT OPERATING EXPENSES. OPERATING PROFIT IS A KEY METRIC USED TO MEASURE YEAR OVER YEAR IMPROVEMENT OF THE SEGMENTS.  RESTRUCTURING AND RESTRUCTURING RELATED COSTS.  BEGINNING IN 2014, WE ANNOUNCED THE CLOSURE OF SEVERAL OF OUR MANUFACTURING AND WAREHOUSE FACILITIES AND CONSOLIDATION INTO EXISTING FACILITIES TO SIMPLIFY MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN OUR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL SYSTEMS, CLIMATE SOLUTIONS AND POWER TRANSMISSION SOLUTIONS SEGMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THESE CLOSURES, WE INCURRED RESTRUCTURING AND RESTRUCTURING-RELATED COSTS. RESTRUCTURING COSTS INCLUDES EMPLOYEE TERMINATION AND PLANT RELOCATION COSTS. RESTRUCTURING RELATED COSTS INCLUDES COSTS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH ACTIONS RESULTING FROM OUR SIMPLIFICATION INITIATIVES, SUCH AS ASSET WRITE-DOWNS OR ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION DUE TO SHORTENED USEFUL LIVES IN CONNECTION WITH SITE CLOSURES, DISCRETIONARY EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT COSTS AND OTHER FACILITY RATIONALIZATION COSTS. RESTRUCTURING COSTS FOR EMPLOYEE TERMINATION EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO BE ACCRUED OVER THE EMPLOYEES REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD WHILE RESTRUCTURING COSTS FOR PLANT RELOCATION COSTS AND RESTRUCTURING-RELATED COSTS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO BE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  OUTLOOK  OUR ORDER TRENDS REMAIN POSITIVE, AND WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT LOW SINGLE DIGIT ORGANIC SALES GROWTH FOR THE FULL YEAR.

OUR TENANTS OPERATE IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY, GENERALLY PROVIDING MEDICAL, SURGICAL AND REHABILITATIVE CARE TO PATIENTS. THE CAPACITY OF OUR TENANTS TO PAY OUR RENTS AND INTEREST IS DEPENDENT UPON THEIR ABILITY TO CONDUCT THEIR OPERATIONS AT PROFITABLE LEVELS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OF THE INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN WHICH OUR TENANTS OPERATE IS GENERALLY POSITIVE FOR EFFICIENT OPERATORS. HOWEVER, OUR TENANTS\u2019 OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ECONOMIC, REGULATORY AND MARKET CONDITIONS THAT MAY AFFECT THEIR PROFITABILITY, WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS. ACCORDINGLY, WE MONITOR CERTAIN KEY FACTORS, CHANGES TO WHICH WE BELIEVE MAY PROVIDE EARLY INDICATIONS OF CONDITIONS THAT MAY AFFECT THE LEVEL OF RISK IN OUR PORTFOLIO.  KEY FACTORS THAT WE CONSIDER IN UNDERWRITING PROSPECTIVE TENANTS AND BORROWERS AND IN MONITORING THE PERFORMANCE OF EXISTING TENANTS AND BORROWERS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  ADMISSION LEVELS AND SURGERY/PROCEDURE/DIAGNOSIS VOLUMES BY TYPE;  \u2022  THE CURRENT, HISTORICAL AND PROSPECTIVE OPERATING MARGINS (MEASURED BY EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND FACILITY RENT) OF EACH TENANT OR BORROWER AND AT EACH FACILITY;  \u2022  THE RATIO OF OUR TENANTS\u2019 OR BORROWERS\u2019 OPERATING EARNINGS BOTH TO FACILITY RENT AND TO FACILITY RENT PLUS OTHER FIXED COSTS, INCLUDING DEBT COSTS;  \u2022  CHANGES IN REVENUE SOURCES OF OUR TENANTS\u2019 OR BORROWERS\u2019 REVENUE, INCLUDING THE RELATIVE MIX OF PUBLIC PAYORS (INCLUDING MEDICARE, MEDICAID/MEDICAL, MANAGED CARE IN THE U.S. AND PENSION FUNDS IN GERMANY) AND PRIVATE PAYORS (INCLUDING COMMERCIAL INSURANCE AND PRIVATE PAY PATIENTS);  \u2022  TRENDS IN TENANTS\u2019 CASH COLLECTIONS, INCLUDING COMPARISON TO RECORDED NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUES;  \u2022  TENANTS\u2019 FREE CASH FLOWS;  \u2022  THE EFFECT OF EVOLVING HEALTHCARE LEGISLATION AND OTHER REGULATIONS ON OUR TENANTS\u2019 OR BORROWERS\u2019 PROFITABILITY AND LIQUIDITY; AND  \u2022  THE COMPETITION AND DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE LOCAL AND SURROUNDING AREAS IN WHICH THE TENANTS OR BORROWERS OPERATE.  CERTAIN BUSINESS FACTORS, IN ADDITION TO THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT OUR TENANTS AND BORROWERS, WILL LIKELY MATERIALLY INFLUENCE OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE.  \u2022  TRENDS IN THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL, INCLUDING MARKET INTEREST RATES, THAT OUR PROSPECTIVE TENANTS MAY USE FOR THEIR REAL ESTATE ASSETS INSTEAD OF FINANCING THEIR REAL ESTATE ASSETS THROUGH LEASE STRUCTURES;  \u2022  CHANGES IN HEALTHCARE REGULATIONS THAT MAY LIMIT THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PHYSICIANS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE OWNERSHIP OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND HEALTHCARE REAL ESTATE;  \u2022  REDUCTIONS IN REIMBURSEMENTS FROM MEDICARE, STATE HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS, AND COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PROVIDERS THAT MAY REDUCE OUR TENANTS\u2019 OR BORROWERS\u2019 PROFITABILITY AND OUR LEASE RATES;  \u2022  COMPETITION FROM OTHER FINANCING SOURCES; AND  \u2022  THE ABILITY OF OUR TENANTS AND BORROWERS TO ACCESS FUNDS IN THE CREDIT MARKETS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  REFER TO OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE, PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION, LOANS, LOSSES FROM RENT AND INTEREST RECEIVABLES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, OUR FAIR VALUE OPTION ELECTION, AND OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY ON CONSOLIDATION. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THESE POLICIES EXCEPT FOR THOSE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2 TO ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A SELF-ADVISED REIT FOCUSED ON INVESTING IN AND OWNING NET-LEASED HEALTHCARE FACILITIES ACROSS THE U.S. AND SELECTIVELY IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. WE HAVE OPERATED AS A REIT SINCE APRIL 6, 2004, AND ACCORDINGLY, ELECTED REIT STATUS UPON THE FILING OF OUR CALENDAR YEAR 2004 FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. MEDICAL PROPERTIES TRUST, INC. WAS INCORPORATED UNDER MARYLAND LAW ON AUGUST 27, 2003, AND MPT OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, L.P. WAS FORMED UNDER DELAWARE LAW ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2003. WE CONDUCT SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR BUSINESS THROUGH MPT OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, L.P. WE ACQUIRE AND DEVELOP HEALTHCARE FACILITIES AND LEASE THE FACILITIES TO HEALTHCARE OPERATING COMPANIES UNDER LONG-TERM NET LEASES, WHICH REQUIRE THE TENANT TO BEAR MOST OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPERTY. WE ALSO MAKE MORTGAGE LOANS TO HEALTHCARE OPERATORS COLLATERALIZED BY THEIR REAL ESTATE ASSETS. IN ADDITION, WE SELECTIVELY MAKE LOANS TO CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATORS THROUGH OUR TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARIES, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH ARE TYPICALLY USED FOR ACQUISITIONS AND WORKING CAPITAL. FINALLY, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ACQUIRE A PROFITS OR OTHER EQUITY INTEREST IN OUR TENANTS THAT GIVES US A RIGHT TO SHARE IN SUCH TENANT\u2019S PROFITS AND LOSSES.  23  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR PORTFOLIO CONSISTED OF 27  6  PROPERTIES LEASED OR LOANED TO  29  OPERATORS, OF WHICH THREE  ARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND 1  0  ARE IN THE FORM OF MORTGAGE LOANS.

THIS DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPECTED LOWER REVENUES AS A RESULT OF PROPERTY SALES POST THE 2018 FIRST QUARTER INCLUDING 71 PROPERTIES SOLD TO FORM THE PRIMOTOP JOINT VENTURE IN THE 2018 THIRD QUARTER. THIS DECREASE IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ADDITIONAL REVENUE FROM NEW INVESTMENTS POST THE 2018 FIRST QUARTER ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL STRAIGHT-LINE RENT REVENUE RECORDED FROM THE CONVERSION OF STEWARD MORTGAGE LOANS TO FEE SIMPLE REAL ESTATE THROUGHOUT 2018. FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cFFO\u201d), AFTER ADJUSTING FOR CERTAIN ITEMS (AS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES), WAS $117.8 MILLION FOR THE 2019 FIRST QUARTER AS COMPARED TO $131.5 MILLION FOR THE 2018 FIRST QUARTER. SIMILAR TO NET INCOME, THIS DECREASE IN FFO IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUE FROM THE PROPERTY SALES POST MARCH 31, 2018.  A COMPARISON OF REVENUES FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018 IS AS FOLLOWS (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS).  2019% OF  TOTAL  2018% OF  TOTAL  YEAR OVER  YEAR  CHANGE  RENT BILLED  $108,598  60.2%  $128,011  62.4%  -15.2%  STRAIGHT-LINE RENT  20,651  11.4%  15,791  7.7%  30.8%  INCOME FROM DIRECT FINANCING LEASES  17,280  9.6%  17,681  8.6%  -2.3%  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME  33,925  18.8%  43,563  21.3%  -22.1%  TOTAL REVENUES  $180,454  100.0%  $205,046  100.0%  -12.0%  26  OUR TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE  2019  FIRST QUARTER IS  DOWN  $24.6  MILLION, OR  12%, OVER THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS  DE  CREASE  IS MADE UP OF THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  OPERATING LEASE REVENUE (INCLUDES RENT BILLED AND STRAIGHT-LINE RENT) \u2013 DOWN $14.6 MILLION OVER THE PRIOR YEAR OF WHICH $35.1 MILLION OF LOWER REVENUES IS DUE TO PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS POST MARCH 31, 2018 (MAJORITY RELATES TO THE FORMATION OF THE PRIMOTOP JOINT VENTURE IN THE 2018 THIRD QUARTER) AND APPROXIMATELY $2.9 MILLION IS FROM UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. THIS DECREASE IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $17.6 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL LEASE REVENUE (OF WHICH $4.3 MILLION REPRESENTS STRAIGHT-LINE RENT) RELATED TO THE CONVERSION OF FOUR STEWARD MORTGAGE LOANS TO FEE SIMPLE ASSETS IN 2018, AND $5.4 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL REVENUE FROM ACQUISITIONS POST MARCH 31, 2018 ALONG WITH EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.  \u2022  INCOME FROM DIRECT FINANCING LEASES \u2013 REMAINED FLAT QUARTER OVER QUARTER.  \u2022  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME \u2013 DOWN $9.6 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO THE FOLLOWING.  -  INTEREST FROM LOANS \u2013 DOWN $10.9 MILLION OVER THE PRIOR YEAR OF WHICH $11.5 MILLION IS THE RESULT OF LOWER INTEREST REVENUE RELATED TO STEWARD MORTGAGE LOANS CONVERTED TO FEE SIMPLE ASSETS IN 2018 AND $4.4 MILLION IS FROM THE PAYOFF OF OUR ERNEST ACQUISITION AND OTHER LOANS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018. THIS IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $4.2 MILLION OF INTEREST REVENUE EARNED ON THE PRIMOTOP JOINT VENTURE SHAREHOLDER LOAN MADE IN AUGUST 2018, $0.7 MILLION FROM NEW LOANS MADE POST THE 2018 FIRST QUARTER, AND $0.2 MILLION FROM OUR ANNUAL ESCALATIONS IN INTEREST RATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH LOAN PROVISIONS.  -  OTHER INCOME \u2013 UP $1.3 MILLION DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON JANUARY 1, 2019, WHEREBY WE ARE NOW REFLECTING CERTAIN PAYMENTS MADE BY OUR TENANTS, INCLUDING GROUND LEASE PAYMENTS AND REIMBURSEMENTS OF PROPERTY TAXES AND INSURANCE, AS REVENUE. THIS REVENUE IS OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING EXPENSE IN THE \u201cPROPERTY-RELATED\u201d LINE ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF NET INCOME.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, TOTALED $50.6 MILLION AND $57.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THIS DECREASE IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE LOWER AVERAGE REVOLVING DEBT BALANCE DURING THE 2019 FIRST QUARTER COMPARED TO THE 2018 FIRST QUARTER AS WE PAID DOWN OUR REVOLVER WITH PROCEEDS FROM PROPERTY SALES POST MARCH 31, 2018.  REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DECREASED TO $33.4 MILLION FROM $35.8 MILLION IN 2018, DUE TO THE PROPERTY SALES IN 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEW INVESTMENTS MADE AND THE CONVERSION OF THE FOUR STEWARD MORTGAGE LOANS TO FEE SIMPLE ASSETS.  PROPERTY-RELATED EXPENSES TOTALED $3.1 MILLION AND $2.2 MILLION FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. AS NOTED ABOVE UNDER THE CAPTION \u201cOTHER INCOME,\u201d THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GROSSING UP OF CERTAIN EXPENSES (SUCH AS GROUND LEASE, PROPERTY TAXES AND INSURANCE) AS PART OF OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON JANUARY 1, 2019.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TOTALED $23.5 MILLION FOR THE 2019 FIRST QUARTER, WHICH IS A $5.6 MILLION INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER. THE MAJORITY OF THE INCREASE RELATES TO STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE FROM OUR PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS. GIVEN OUR STRONG PERFORMANCE IN 2018 WITH A TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN OF 25% ALONG WITH OUR CURRENT ACQUISITION PIPELINE AND EXPECTATIONS TO CLOSE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ACQUISITIONS IN 2019, WE BELIEVE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT SUCH PERFORMANCE AWARDS WILL BE EARNED AND HAVE ADJUSTED OUR STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE ACCORDINGLY.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, WE SOLD OUR ST. JOSEPH\u2019S PROPERTY AT A GAIN OF $1.5 MILLION. WE HAVE NO DISPOSITIONS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. SEE NOTE 3 TO ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR FURTHER DETAILS.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WE INCURRED OTHER EXPENSE OF $4.7 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED NON-CASH AND UNREALIZED FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ON OUR ERNEST INVESTMENTS THAT WERE SOLD OR REPAID IN OCTOBER 2018. NO SIMILAR FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS WERE RECORDED IN THE 2019 FIRST QUARTER.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE TYPICALLY INCLUDES U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES ON OUR TRS ENTITIES, AS WELL AS NON-U.S. INCOME BASED OR WITHHOLDING TAXES ON CERTAIN INVESTMENTS LOCATED IN JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE $2.3 MILLION INCOME TAX BENEFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, REPRESENTS THE BENEFIT FROM STRAIGHT-LINE RENT AND OTHER WRITE-OFFS ON OUR TRS IN THE QUARTER. THE BENEFIT IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FINANCIAL TAXABLE INCOME FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENTS.  WE UTILIZE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE RECORDED TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE THESE ASSETS WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REALIZED. IN MAKING SUCH DETERMINATION, ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE IS CONSIDERED, INCLUDING SCHEDULED REVERSALS OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, PROJECTED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, AND RECENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. BASED UPON OUR REVIEW OF ALL POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING OUR THREE-YEAR CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX BOOK LOSS POSITION IN CERTAIN ENTITIES, WE CONCLUDED THAT A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $3 MILLION SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE RECORDED AGAINST CERTAIN OF OUR INTERNATIONAL NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT MARCH 31, 2019. IN THE FUTURE, IF WE DETERMINE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL REALIZE OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WE WILL REVERSE THE APPLICABLE PORTION OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE, RECOGNIZE AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE, AND INCUR HIGHER INCOME TAXES IN FUTURE PERIODS AS INCOME EARNED.  27  RECONCILIATION OF  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS FOLLOWING THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY UTILIZE FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS, OR FFO, AS A SUPPLEMENTAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE. FFO, REFLECTING THE ASSUMPTION THAT REAL ESTATE ASSET VALUES RISE OR FALL WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, PRINCIPALLY ADJUSTS FOR THE EFFECTS OF GAAP DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS, WHICH ASSUMES THAT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE DIMINISHES PREDICTABLY OVER TIME. WE COMPUTE FFO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DEFINITION PROVIDED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, OR NAREIT, WHICH REPRESENTS NET INCOME (LOSS) (COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP), EXCLUDING GAINS (LOSSES) ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON REAL ESTATE ASSETS, PLUS REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND AFTER ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES.  IN ADDITION TO PRESENTING FFO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NAREIT DEFINITION, WE ALSO DISCLOSE NORMALIZED FFO, WHICH ADJUSTS FFO FOR ITEMS THAT RELATE TO UNANTICIPATED OR NON-CORE EVENTS OR ACTIVITIES OR ACCOUNTING CHANGES THAT, IF NOT NOTED, WOULD MAKE COMPARISON TO PRIOR PERIOD RESULTS AND MARKET EXPECTATIONS LESS MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE USE OF FFO, COMBINED WITH THE REQUIRED GAAP PRESENTATIONS, IMPROVES THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS AMONG INVESTORS AND THE USE OF NORMALIZED FFO MAKES COMPARISONS OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS WITH PRIOR PERIODS AND OTHER COMPANIES MORE MEANINGFUL. WHILE FFO AND NORMALIZED FFO ARE RELEVANT AND WIDELY USED SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF REITS, THEY SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE MEASURE OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE SINCE THE MEASURES DO NOT REFLECT EITHER DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION COSTS OR THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND LEASING COSTS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPERTIES, WHICH CAN BE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC COSTS THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FFO AND NORMALIZED FFO SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET INCOME (LOSS) (COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP) AS INDICATORS OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR TO CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES (COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP) AS AN INDICATOR OF OUR LIQUIDITY.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO MPT COMMON STOCKHOLDERS TO FFO FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018 (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA).

WE USED THESE OPERATING CASH FLOWS ALONG WITH CASH ON-HAND TO FUND OUR DIVIDENDS OF $95.4 MILLION AND CERTAIN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCLUDING AN INITIAL DEPOSIT ON THE HEALTHSCOPE ACQUISITION DISCUSSED IN NOTE 9, DEVELOPMENT COSTS ON OUR CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO CERTAIN OF OUR CORPORATE ASSETS.  IN ANTICIPATION OF FUTURE ACQUISITIONS IN 2019, WE SOLD 20.1 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR AT-THE-MARKET EQUITY PROGRAM IN THE FIRST QUARTER GENERATING NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $354 MILLION. FURTHERMORE, IN APRIL 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A $1.2 BILLION AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR TERM LOAN COMMITMENT THAT WILL CLOSE AND FUND ONCE SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF THE HEALTHSCOPE ACQUISITION IS RECEIVED.  29  2018  CASH FLOW ACTIVITY  DURING THE 2018 FIRST QUARTER, WE GENERATED $94.8 MILLION OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF RENT AND INTEREST FROM MORTGAGE AND OTHER LOANS.

HOWEVER, OUR ACQUISITION PIPELINE IS ROBUST, SO IN ORDER TO FUND ACQUISITIONS ABOVE OUR $2.5 BILLION GOAL FOR 2019 AND BEYOND AND TO FUND DEBT MATURITIES COMING DUE IN LATER YEARS, WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, AND WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING SOURCES ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET AND WE MAY ACCESS ONE OR A COMBINATION OF THEM.  \u2022  SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES;  \u2022  AMENDING OR ENTERING INTO NEW BANK TERM LOANS,  \u2022  PLACING NEW SECURED LOANS ON REAL ESTATE LOCATED IN AND OUTSIDE THE U.S.;  \u2022  ISSUANCE OF NEW USD OR EUR DENOMINATED DEBT SECURITIES, INCLUDING SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES; AND/OR  \u2022  PROCEEDS FROM STRATEGIC PROPERTY SALES.

(REFERRED TO HEREIN AS \u201cWE\u201d, \u201cUS\u201d, AND \u201cOUR\u201d), TOGETHER WITH ITS WHOLLY-OWNED  AND MAJORITY-OWNED CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARIES IS A GLOBAL CLEAN ENERGY COMPANY THAT OWNS PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY, SES GASIFICATION  TECHNOLOGY (\u201cSGT\u201d), FOR THE LOW-COST AND ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTION OF SYNTHESIS GAS (REFERRED TO AS \u201cSYNGAS\u201d).  OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN ON COMMERCIALIZING OUR TECHNOLOGY BOTH IN CHINA AND GLOBALLY THROUGH THE REGIONAL BUSINESS PLATFORMS WE HAVE  CREATED WITH PARTNERS IN AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIAN FUTURE ENERGY PTY LTD (\u201cAFE\u201d), AND IN POLAND, SES ENCOAL ENERGY SP.  Z O.O (\u201cSEE\u201d).  OVER  THE PAST TEN YEARS, WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED OUR TECHNOLOGY INTO FIVE INDUSTRIAL SCALE PROJECTS IN CHINA. WE INVESTED IN  TWO OF THOSE INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS AND HAVE LICENSED OUR TECHNOLOGY INTO THE REMAINING THREE. TODAY, FOUR OF THESE PROJECTS ARE  OPERATING AND ARE SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATING OUR TECHNOLOGY. OUR FIRST PROJECT, THE SMALLER SCALE SYNTHESIS ENERGY SYSTEMS (ZAO  ZHANG) NEW GAS COMPANY LTD (\u201cZZ\u201d) COMMERCIAL DEMONSTRATION PLANT, OPERATED FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND ALSO SUCCESSFULLY  DEMONSTRATED OUR TECHNOLOGY AND WAS RETIRED IN 2015.  THROUGH  2018, OUR BUSINESS MODEL HAD BEEN TO CREATE VALUE FROM OUR TECHNOLOGY IN CHINA, THROUGH TSEC, IN AUSTRALIA THROUGH AFE, IN POLAND  THROUGH SEE AND FROM LICENSING OUR TECHNOLOGY GLOBALLY INTO PROJECTS IN REGIONS SUCH AS BRAZIL AND INDIA. HOWEVER, WE HAVE DETERMINED  THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE CASH TO CONTINUE THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF SGT AND IS NOW UNDERTAKING STEPS TO REDUCE OUR EXPENDITURES.  IN THE CURRENT QUARTER, WE HAVE SUSPENDED OUR GLOBAL SGT COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS AND WE HAVE SEVERED MOST OF OUR SGT TECHNOLOGY  RESOURCES.  ON  MARCH 29, 2019, CLARKSONS PLATOU SECURITIES, INC. (\u201cCPS\u201d) WAS ENGAGED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ACT AS OUR FINANCIAL  ADVISOR. CPS WILL ADVISE US AS IT CONDUCTS A PROCESS TO EVALUATE FINANCING OPTIONS AND STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS BUT NOT  LIMITED TO A STRATEGIC MERGER, A SALE, A RECAPITALIZATION AND/OR A FINANCING CONSISTING OF EQUITY AND/OR DEBT SECURITIES. WE REMAIN  FOCUSED ON MAXIMIZING SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND PROTECTING THE INTERESTS OF OUR DEBTHOLDERS. A DEFINITIVE TIMETABLE FOR COMPLETION  OF THE EVALUATION OF FINANCING AND STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES HAS NOT BEEN SET AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE PROCESS WILL  RESULT IN ANY TRANSACTION BEING ANNOUNCED OR COMPLETED IN THE FUTURE.  ON  APRIL 4, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A TECHNOLOGY PURCHASE OPTION AGREEMENT (THE \u201cAGREEMENT\u201d) WITH AFE. UNDER THE TERMS  OF THE AGREEMENT, AFE HAS AN EXCLUSIVE OPTION THROUGH JULY 31, 2019 TO PURCHASE 100% OWNERSHIP OF SYNTHESIS ENERGY SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY,  LLC, OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY WHICH OWNS OUR INTEREST IN THE SGT. IN ADDITION, OWNERSHIP RIGHTS TO SGT ARE CARVED OUT OF THE  TRANSACTION AND RETAINED BY US FOR CHINA AND WE HAVE A THREE-YEAR OPTION PERIOD POST-CLOSING TO MONETIZE SGT FOR INDIA, BRAZIL,  POLAND AND FOR THE DRI TECHNOLOGY MARKET SEGMENT. WE INTEND TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS IN THESE CARVED OUT REGIONS  TO SEEK MUTUALLY AGREEABLE TERMS UNDER WHICH SGT CAN BE UTILIZED IN THOSE REGIONS.  AFE  ISSUED ONE MILLION SHARES TO US IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE AGREEMENT. AFE WOULD ALSO PAY (I) AN ADDITIONAL $2.0 MILLION  IN THREE EQUAL INSTALLMENTS, WITH THE FIRST INSTALLMENT PAID AT CLOSING AND THE REMAINDER OVER THE SUBSEQUENT TWELVE MONTHS, AND  (II) $3.8 MILLION ON THE EARLIER OF THE CLOSING OF A CONTRUCTION FINANCING BY AFE OR FIVE YEARS FROM CLOSING. THE CLOSING OF THE  TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO THE NEGOTIATION OF DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER CONDITIONS SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION  TO THE PAYMENT SCHEDULE ABOVE, AFE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL ONE MILLION SHARES WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE AGREEMENT AND WOULD ALSO  PAY AN ADDITIONAL $100,000 WITH THE FIRST INSTALLMENT PAID AT CLOSING AS FULL AND FINAL SETTLEMENT OF OUTSTANDING INVOICES OWING  AFE TO US AT THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT.  CURRENTLY,  AFE IS DEVELOPING ENERGY AND RESOURCE PROJECTS WITH WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE NECESSARY COMMERCIAL AND FINANCING STRUCTURES TO  DELIVER ATTRACTIVE FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE OWN APPROXIMATELY 36% OF AFE. AFE IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ITS GLADSTONE  ENERGY AND AMMONIA PROJECT AND THE RAISING OF FUNDS THAT WOULD ALLOW THIS PROJECT TO ADVANCE INTO FRONT-END ENGINEERING DESIGN  (FEED) AND WOULD ALLOW AFE TO COMPLETE THE PURCHASE OF SYNTHESIS ENERGY SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY, LLC FROM THE COMPANY.  WE  OPERATE OUR BUSINESS FROM OUR HEADQUARTERS LOCATED IN HOUSTON, TEXAS AND OUR OFFICE IN SHANGHAI, CHINA.  28  OUTLOOK  AS  OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD $2.4 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND A NEGATIVE $4.7 MILLION OF WORKING CAPITAL. THE NEGATIVE  WORKING CAPITAL IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF THE SENIOR SECURED DEBENTURES (THE \u201cDEBENTURES\u201d) FROM  A NONCURRENT TO A CURRENT LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH A TECHNICAL DEFAULT.  AS  OF MAY 13, 2019, WE HAD $1.8 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. OF THE $1.8 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, $1.7 MILLION  RESIDES IN THE UNITED STATES OR EASILY ACCESSED FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND APPROXIMATELY $0.1 MILLION RESIDES IN CHINA.  IN  THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE UNDERTOOK ADDITIONAL STEPS TO REDUCE OUR OVERHEAD EXPENSES THROUGH THE TERMINATION OF CERTAIN  TECHNOLOGY AND ADMINISTRATIVE EMPLOYEES AND OTHER REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OFFICE EXPENSES AND PROFESSIONAL FEES.

AS  NOTED ABOVE, CPS HAS BEEN ENGAGED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ACT AS OUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR TO ADVISE THE COMPANY AS IT CONDUCTS  A PROCESS TO EVALUATE FINANCING OPTIONS AND STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES SUCH AS BUT NOT LIMITED TO A STRATEGIC MERGER, A SALE, A RECAPITALIZATION  AND/OR A FINANCING CONSISTING OF EQUITY AND/OR DEBT SECURITIES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE UNDERTAKING FURTHER EXPENSE REDUCTIONS WHICH  WE EXPECT TO BE REALIZED OVER THE REMAINDER OF CALENDAR YEAR 2019 TO IMPROVE OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND PRESERVE OUR AVAILABLE  CASH TO ALLOW MORE TIME TO COMPLETE THE FINANCING AND STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS EVALUATION WORK.  AS  PART OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, WE INTEND TO (I) WORK WITH CPS TO COMPLETE THE EVALUATION OF FINANCING OPTIONS  AND STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR THE COMPANY; (II) MONITOR SUPPORT AND FACILITATE OUR MINORITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN BFR IN ORDER  TO REALIZE THE FINANCIAL VALUE THROUGH DIVIDEND INCOME OR OTHER MEANS; (III) WORK TO RECOVER CASH AND MONETIZE OUR YIMA JOINT  VENTURE AND TSEC JOINT VENTURE OPERATIONS SUCH AS THROUGH A RESTRUCTURING OR DIVESTITURE; AND (IV) TAKING ANY ADDITIONAL STEPS  TO UTILIZE OUR EXISTING CASH RESERVES IN THE MOST FINANCIALLY PRODUCTIVE MEANS POSSIBLE.

WE  CURRENTLY HAVE VERY LIMITED FINANCIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES TO FULLY IMPLEMENT OUR PLANS AND DUE TO EMPLOYEE RESOURCE REDUCTIONS  AND WE HAVE SUSPENDED OUR SGT COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS. WE CAN MAKE NO ASSURANCES THAT AFE AND OUR OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS  INCLUDING ANY POTENTIAL RETURN FROM BFR WILL PROVIDE US WITH SUFFICIENT AND TIMELY CASH FLOWS TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS.  AS  NOTED ABOVE, WE ARE SEEKING TO IMPROVE OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND WE MAY CHOOSE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THROUGH ALTERNATIVES  SUCH AS EQUITY AND DEBT FINANCING, DIVESTING CERTAIN ASSETS SUCH AS OUR INTERESTS IN OUR YIMA JOINT VENTURE, OUR TSEC JOINT VENTURE,  AND OUR TECHNOLOGY, AND/OR RESTRUCTURING THE COMPANY. WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE THAT ANY OF THESE ALTERNATIVES WILL BE AVAILABLE  TO US IN THE FUTURE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. ANY SUCH ALTERNATIVE COULD BE DILUTIVE TO OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS AND DEBTHOLDERS.  IF WE CANNOT RAISE REQUIRED FUNDS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY FURTHER SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE OUR EXPENSES AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE  TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) SUSTAIN OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES; (II) FUND CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS AS THEY BECOME DUE  INCLUDING LICENSE FEES AND OTHER VENDOR PAYMENTS; (III) RESPOND TO UNANTICIPATED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS; OR (IV) REPAY OUR INDEBTEDNESS.

IN  DECEMBER 2017 AND JANUARY 2018, ON-GOING DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE MANAGEMENT RESULTED  IN THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEING TO PAY VARIOUS COSTS INCURRED BY US DURING THE CONSTRUCTION AND COMMISSIONING PERIOD OF THE FACILITY  IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY 16 MILLION CHINESE RENMINBI YUAN, (\u201cRMB\u201d), (APPROXIMATELY $2.3 MILLION). AS OF JUNE  30, 2018, WE HAVE RECEIVED 6.15 MILLION RMB (APPROXIMATELY $0.9 MILLION) OF PAYMENTS FROM THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE RELATED TO THESE  COSTS. ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS MAY BE FORTHCOMING. DUE TO UNCERTAINTY, REVENUES WILL BE RECORDED UPON RECEIPT OF PAYMENT. DISPITE  OUR CONTINUOUS COLLECTION EFFORTS, WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS DURING THE NINE-MONTHS ENDING MARCH 31, 2019.  SINCE  2014, WE HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR THIS JOINT VENTURE UNDER THE COST METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. OUR CONCLUSION TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS JOINT VENTURE  UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY IS BASED UPON OUR HISTORICAL LACK OF SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE IN THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE. THE LACK OF SIGNIFICANT  INFLUENCE WAS DETERMINED BASED UPON OUR INTERACTIONS WITH THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE RELATED TO OUR LIMITED PARTICIPATION IN OPERATING  AND FINANCIAL POLICYMAKING PROCESSES COUPLED WITH OUR LIMITED ABILITY TO INFLUENCE DECISIONS WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE FINANCIAL  SUCCESS OF THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE. WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR LEVEL OF INFLUENCE OVER THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE.  35  WE  EVALUATED THE CONDITIONS OF THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECREASE IN VALUE HAD OCCURRED  AS OF JUNE 30, 2018 AND 2017. AT JUNE 30, 2018, MANAGEMENT DETERMINED THERE WAS A TRIGGERING EVENT RELATED TO THE VALUE OF ITS  INVESTMENT IN THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE. LOWER PRODUCTION LEVELS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER REDUCED THE ANNUAL PRODUCTION BELOW EXPECTATION,  WHICH RESULTED IN A NET INCREASE IN THE WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AND THE DEBT LEVEL OF THE JOINT VENTURE. AT JUNE 30, 2017, MANAGEMENT  DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE TRIGGERING EVENTS RELATED TO THE VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT AND THESE WERE THE LOWER THAN EXPECTED PRODUCTION  LEVELS AND THE INCREASED DEBT LEVELS AS COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR, WHICH INDICATED A CONTINUED CASH FLOW CONCERN FOR THE JOINT  VENTURE. MANAGEMENT DETERMINED THESE EVENTS IN BOTH YEARS WERE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IN NATURE AND THEREFORE CONDUCTED AN IMPAIRMENT  ANALYSIS UTILIZING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW FAIR MARKET VALUATION AND A BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL-FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONALITY USED IN VALUING  COMPANIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF DEBT WHERE A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW VALUATION MAY BE INADEQUATE FOR ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE  WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A THIRD-PARTY VALUATION EXPERT. IN THESE VALUATIONS, SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS WERE USED TO CALCULATE  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT (SEE NOTE 2 \u2013  (E) USE OF ESTIMATES)  . THESE INPUTS INCLUDED FORECASTED METHANOL AND  COAL PRICES, CALCULATED DISCOUNT RATES AND DISCOUNT FOR LACK OF MARKETABILITY AS THE MAJORITY OWNER IS A STATE-OWNED ENTITY IN  CHINA, VOLATILITY ANALYSIS AND INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE JOINT VENTURE. THE VALUATION LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE INVESTMENT  IN THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE WAS IMPAIRED AS OF JUNE 30, 2018, AND ACCORDINGLY, WE RECORDED A $3.5 MILLION IMPAIRMENT FOR THE YEAR  ENDED JUNE 30, 2018. THE PREVIOUS VALUATION CONCLUDED THERE WAS AN IMPAIRMENT WHICH RESULTED IN US RECORDING A $17.7 MILLION IMPAIRMENT  FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017.  AS  OF MARCH 31, 2019, THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE\u2019S THIRD-PARTY LOANS BALANCE WAS APPROXIMATELY 46.9 MILLION CHINESE RENMINBI YUAN  (\u201cRMB\u201d), APPROXIMATELY $7.0 MILLION, WITH $5.0 MILLION DUE IN APRIL 2019 AND $2.0 MILLION DUE IN APRIL 2020.  MANAGEMENT  DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NOT AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY TRIGGERING EVENT DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE CARRYING VALUE  OF OUR YIMA JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY $5.0 MILLION AS OF BOTH MARCH 31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2018. WE CONTINUE TO  MONITOR THE YIMA JOINT VENTURE AND COULD RECORD AN ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT IN THE FUTURE IF OPERATING CONDITIONS DETERIORATE OR  IF THE CASH FLOW SITUATION WORSENS.  TIANWO-SES  CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED  JOINT  VENTURE CONTRACT  IN  FEBRUARY 2014, SES ASIA TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED, ONE OF OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES, ENTERED INTO A JOINT VENTURE CONTRACT (THE  \u201cJV CONTRACT\u201d) WITH ZHANGJIAGANG CHEMICAL MACHINERY CO., LTD., WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY CHANGED ITS LEGAL NAME TO SUZHOU  THVOW TECHNOLOGY CO. LTD. (\u201cSTT\u201d), TO FORM TIANWO-SES CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED (THE \u201cTSEC JOINT VENTURE\u201d).  THE PURPOSE OF THE TSEC JOINT VENTURE IS TO ESTABLISH OUR GASIFICATION TECHNOLOGY AS THE LEADING GASIFICATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE  TSEC JOINT VENTURE TERRITORY (WHICH IS CHINA, INDONESIA, THE PHILIPPINES, VIETNAM, MONGOLIA AND MALAYSIA) BY BECOMING A LEADING  PROVIDER OF PROPRIETARY EQUIPMENT AND ENGINEERING SERVICES FOR THE TECHNOLOGY. THE SCOPE OF THE TSEC JOINT VENTURE IS TO MARKET  AND LICENSE OUR GASIFICATION TECHNOLOGY VIA PROJECT SUBLICENSES; PROCUREMENT AND SALE OF PROPRIETARY EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES; COAL  TESTING; AND ENGINEERING, PROCUREMENT AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO THE TECHNOLOGY.  IN  AUGUST 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A RESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT OF THE TSEC JOINT VENTURE (\u201cRESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT\u201d). THE  AGREED CHANGE IN SHARE OWNERSHIP, REDUCTION IN THE REGISTERED CAPITAL OF THE JOINT VENTURE, AND THE FINAL TRANSFER OF SHARES WITH  LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES WAS COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 2017. IN THIS RESTRUCTURING, AN ADDITIONAL PARTY WAS ADDED TO THE JV CONTRACT,  UPON RECEIPT OF FINAL GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS, THE INNOVATIVE COAL CHEMICAL DESIGN INSTITUTE (\u201cICCDI\u201d) HAS BECOME A  25% OWNER OF TSEC JOINT VENTURE, WE HAVE DECREASED OUR OWNERSHIP TO 25% AND STT HAS DECREASED ITS OWNERSHIP TO 50%. ICCDI PREVIOUSLY  SERVED AS GENERAL CONTRACTOR AND ENGINEERED AND CONSTRUCTED ALL THREE PROJECTS FOR THE ALUMINUM CORPORATION OF CHINA. WE RECEIVED  11.15 MILLION RMB (APPROXIMATELY $1.7 MILLION) FROM ICCDI AS A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE JOINT VENTURE  RESTRUCTURING, WE ALSO RECEIVED 1.2 MILLION RMB (APPROXIMATELY $180,000) RELATED TO OUTSTANDING INVOICES FOR SERVICES WE HAD PROVIDED  TO THE TSEC JOINT VENTURE.  THE  TSEC JOINT VENTURE IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD. OUR INITIAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION IN THE FORMATION OF THE VENTURE  WAS THE TECHNOLOGY USAGE AND CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT (\u201cTUCA\u201d), WHICH IS AN INTANGIBLE ASSET. AS SUCH, WE DID NOT RECORD  A CARRYING VALUE AT THE INCEPTION OF THE VENTURE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN THE TSEC JOINT VENTURE AS OF BOTH MARCH  31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2018 WAS ZERO.  36  TUCA  PURSUANT  TO THE TUCA, WE HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE TSEC JOINT VENTURE CERTAIN EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO OUR GASIFICATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE TSEC  JOINT VENTURE TERRITORY, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO: (I) GRANT SITE SPECIFIC PROJECT SUB-LICENSES TO THIRD PARTIES; (II) USE OUR MARKS  FOR PROPRIETARY EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES; (III) ENGINEER AND/OR DESIGN PROCESSES THAT UTILIZE OUR TECHNOLOGY OR OUR OTHER INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY; (IV) PROVIDE ENGINEERING AND DESIGN SERVICES FOR JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS AND (V) TAKE OVER THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROJECTS  IN THE TSEC JOINT VENTURE TERRITORY THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN DEVELOPED BY US AND OUR AFFILIATES. AS A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING  AGREEMENT, ICCDI WAS ADDED AS A PARTY TO THE TUCA, BUT ALL OTHER MATERIAL TERMS REMAINED THE SAME.  GTI  AGREEMENT  IN  NOVEMBER 2009, WE ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED LICENSE AGREEMENT, OR THE GTI AGREEMENT, WITH GTI, REPLACING THE AMENDED  AND RESTATED LICENSE AGREEMENT BETWEEN US AND GTI DATED AUGUST 31, 2006, AS AMENDED. UNDER THE GTI AGREEMENT, WE MAINTAIN OUR  EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE RIGHT TO LICENSE THE U-GAS  \u00ae  TECHNOLOGY FOR ALL TYPES OF COALS AND COAL/BIOMASS MIXTURES WITH  COAL CONTENT EXCEEDING 60%, AS WELL AS THE NON-EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO LICENSE THE U-GAS  \u00ae  TECHNOLOGY FOR 100% BIOMASS  AND COAL/BIOMASS BLENDS EXCEEDING 40% BIOMASS.

THE USE OF GROSS  SALES ALLOWS EVALUATION OF SALES PERFORMANCE BEFORE THE EFFECT OF ANY PROMOTIONAL ITEMS, WHICH CAN MASK CERTAIN PERFORMANCE ISSUES.  WE THEREFORE BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENTATION OF GROSS SALES PROVIDES A USEFUL MEASURE OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. GROSS SALES  ARE NOT A MEASURE THAT IS RECOGNIZED UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET SALES, WHICH IS DETERMINED  IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AND SHOULD NOT BE USED ALONE AS AN INDICATOR OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE IN PLACE OF NET SALES. ADDITIONALLY,  GROSS SALES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES, AS GROSS SALES HAVE BEEN DEFINED BY OUR  INTERNAL REPORTING PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, GROSS SALES MAY NOT BE REALIZED IN THE FORM OF CASH RECEIPTS AS PROMOTIONAL PAYMENTS  AND ALLOWANCES MAY BE DEDUCTED FROM PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM CERTAIN CUSTOMERS.  5  (B)  ALTHOUGH THE EXPENDITURES DESCRIBED IN THIS LINE ITEM ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND MEET GAAP REQUIREMENTS, THE DISCLOSURE  THEREOF DOES NOT CONFORM TO GAAP PRESENTATION REQUIREMENTS.

THE PRESENTATION  OF PROMOTIONAL AND OTHER ALLOWANCES FACILITATES AN EVALUATION OF THEIR IMPACT ON THE DETERMINATION OF NET SALES AND THE SPENDING  LEVELS INCURRED OR CORRELATED WITH SUCH SALES. PROMOTIONAL AND OTHER ALLOWANCES CONSTITUTE A MATERIAL PORTION OF OUR MARKETING  ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY\u2019S PROMOTIONAL ALLOWANCE PROGRAMS WITH ITS NUMEROUS DISTRIBUTORS AND/OR RETAILERS ARE EXECUTED THROUGH  SEPARATE AGREEMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THESE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE ARRANGEMENTS  DESCRIBED ABOVE AND ARE OF VARYING DURATIONS, RANGING FROM ONE WEEK TO ONE YEAR.

CORE  BRAND GROSS REVENUE INCREASED 15% DURING THE CURRENT QUARTER AS COMPARED TO THE YEAR AGO QUARTER, FROM $7,917 TO $9,098, DRIVEN  BY VIRGIL\u2019S VOLUME GROWTH OF 46%. THIS INCREASE WAS REDUCED BY LAPPING DISCONTINUED AND PRIVATE LABEL SALES WHICH ARE NO  LONGER PART OF OUR PORTFOLIO. THE RESULT IS AN INCREASE OF TOTAL GROSS REVENUE OF 8%, TO $9,520 FROM $8,855 DURING THE YEAR AGO  PERIOD. ON A 12-OUNCE CASE BASIS, PRICE ON OUR CORE BRANDS INCREASED $0.21 PER 12-OUNCE CASE OR 1% YEAR OVER YEAR, WHILE VOLUME  GREW 14% VS THE YEAR-AGO QUARTER.  DISCOUNTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS SALES INCREASED TO 11% IN THE FIRST QUARTER  OF 2019 FROM 6% IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN OUR PROMOTIONS WAS DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS: THE PLANNED REDUCTION IN  PROMOTIONAL SPEND IN  Q1  2018, THE ACTIVATION OF NEW PROMOTIONS FOR OUR EXISTING REED\u2019S AND VIRGIL\u2019S SKUS, THE INCREMENTAL PROMOTIONAL  SPEND ON OUR NEW VIRGIL\u2019S ZERO SUGAR CANS  AND  INCREASED SLOTTING TO GAIN NEW  AUTHORIZATIONS  FOR EXISTING AND INNOVATION SKUS. AS A RESULT, NET SALES REVENUE GREW 2% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 TO $8,449, COMPARED TO  $8,288 IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  7  COST  OF GOODS SOLD AND PRODUCED  COST  OF GOODS SOLD DECREASED $40 DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE YEAR-AGO QUARTER. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES,  COST OF GOODS SOLD DECREASED 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, TO 70% FROM 72% IN THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD.  IDLE  AND OTHER COSTS WERE REDUCED TO $150, DOWN FROM $676 IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE PLANT SALE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OUR  IDLE COSTS, WHILE THE REMAINING OTHER COSTS WERE RELATED TO COMPLETING THE TRANSITION OF THE PLANT TO CCB. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE  IDLE AND OTHER COSTS TO BE MATERIAL IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.  TOTAL  COST OF GOODS PER CASE DECLINED TO $11.6 PER CASE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 FROM $12.7 PER CASE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018  DRIVEN BY PROCUREMENT EFFICIENCIES, STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR MAJOR SUPPLIERS, AND A REDUCTION OF IDLE COSTS. COST OF GOODS  SOLD PER CASE ON CORE BRANDS INCREASED TO $11.2 DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 FROM $10.7 PER CASE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER  OF 2018. THE MAIN DRIVERS OF THE INCREASE WERE DRIVEN BY PRODUCT MIX, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY THE ZERO-SUGAR LINE. WE ARE CONTINUING  TO WORK WITH SUPPLIERS AND CO-PACKERS TO IMPROVE OUR PROCESSES AND MAXIMIZE COST EFFICIENCIES AS THE COMPANY\u2019S NEW PRODUCT  OFFERINGS CONTINUE TO GROW AND SCALE.  GROSS  MARGIN  OUR  PRICE AND SKU RESTRUCTURING ALONG WITH A NEW STREAMLINED MODEL, RESULTED IN A 2-PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN IN  THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, TO 30% COMPARED TO 28% IN SAME QUARTER OF 2018.  OPERATING  EXPENSES  DELIVERY  AND HANDLING EXPENSES  DELIVERY AND HANDLING EXPENSES  CONSIST OF DELIVERY COSTS TO CUSTOMERS AND WAREHOUSING COSTS INCURRED FOR HANDLING OUR FINISHED GOODS AFTER PRODUCTION. DELIVERY  AND HANDLING EXPENSES INCREASED BY $74 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 TO $1,030 FROM $956 IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 DRIVEN BY INCREASED  VOLUMES  . IN BOTH YEARS, DELIVERY COSTS WERE 12% OF NET  SALES AND $2.0 PER CASE.  SELLING  AND MARKETING EXPENSES  MARKETING  EXPENSES CONSIST OF DIRECT MARKETING, MARKETING LABOR AND MARKETING SUPPORT COSTS. SELLING EXPENSES CONSIST OF ALL OTHER SELLING-RELATED  EXPENSES INCLUDING PERSONNEL AND CONTRACTOR SUPPORT.  TOTAL  SELLING AND MARKETING EXPENSES WERE $2,015 DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, COMPARED TO $1,013 DURING THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD. AS  A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, SELLING AND MARKETING COSTS INCREASED TO 24% DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, AS COMPARED  TO 12% DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASED INVESTMENT IN SALES AND MARKETING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S  STRATEGY TO REFRESH THE BRANDS, LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS INTO THE MARKET, OPEN NEW DOORS OF DISTRIBUTION, CREATE NEW COMMUNICATION  CAMPAIGNS TO INCREASE CORE BRANDS SALES VELOCITY AND LAY THE GROUNDWORK TO RE-ACCELERATE GROWTH OF THE CORE BRANDS.  THE  INCREASE IS DUE TO ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL  , INTEGRATED  MARKETING CAMPAIGN CREATIVE AND PRODUCTION, AND INNOVATION DEVELOPMENT (PRODUCT, RESEARCH, AND PACKAGING).  GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF THE COST OF EXECUTIVE, ADMINISTRATIVE, AND FINANCE PERSONNEL, AS WELL AS PROFESSIONAL  FEES. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 TO $2,371 FROM $1,433, AN INCREASE OF $938 OVER  THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE INCREASE WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY INCREMENTAL EQUITY AWARDS OF $332,  BONUS ACCRUALS OF $97, ALONG WITH ONE-TIME FINAL TRANSITION COSTS RELATING TO OUR PLANT SALE OF $220.  8  LOSS  FROM OPERATIONS  THE  LOSS FROM  OPERATIONS WAS $2,882 FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $1,125 IN THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018 DRIVEN BY INCREASE INVESTMENT IN SALES AND MARKETING  INITIATIVES AND G&A EXPENSES WHICH INCLUDED ONE-TIME TRANSITION EXPENSES RELATED TO THE PLANT SALE.  INTEREST  AND OTHER EXPENSE  INTEREST  AND OTHER EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 CONSISTED OF $335 OF INTEREST EXPENSE AS WELL AS EXPENSE RELATED  TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR WARRANT LIABILITY OF $48. DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018, INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $485, AND  EXPENSE RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR WARRANT LIABILITY WAS $5. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE IS THE RESULT  OF LOWER BORROWINGS AS WELL AS LOWER RATES ON OUR REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT.  MODIFIED  EBITDA  IN  ADDITION TO OUR GAAP RESULTS, WE PRESENT MODIFIED EBITDA AS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OUR PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, MODIFIED EBITDA  IS NOT A RECOGNIZED MEASUREMENT UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET INCOME, INCOME FROM OPERATIONS  OR ANY OTHER PERFORMANCE MEASURE DERIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, OR AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY. WE DEFINE MODIFIED EBITDA AS NET INCOME (LOSS), PLUS INTEREST EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION,  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF WARRANT EXPENSE, AND ONE-TIME RESTRUCTURING-RELATED COSTS INCLUDING EMPLOYEE  SEVERANCE AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT.  MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS  OUR CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE TO BE THAT WHICH OUR MANAGERS CAN AFFECT IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD THROUGH THEIR MANAGEMENT OF  THE RESOURCES THAT AFFECT OUR UNDERLYING REVENUE AND PROFIT GENERATING OPERATIONS DURING THAT PERIOD. NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS TO  OUR RESULTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP ARE ITEMIZED BELOW. YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO EVALUATE THESE ADJUSTMENTS AND THE  REASONS WE CONSIDER THEM APPROPRIATE FOR SUPPLEMENTAL ANALYSIS. IN EVALUATING MODIFIED EBITDA, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN  THE FUTURE WE MAY INCUR EXPENSES THAT ARE THE SAME AS OR SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THIS PRESENTATION. OUR  PRESENTATION OF MODIFIED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN INFERENCE THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY UNUSUAL  OR NON-RECURRING ITEMS.  9  SET  FORTH BELOW IS A RECONCILIATION OF NET LOSS TO MODIFIED EBITDA FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018 (UNAUDITED;  IN THOUSANDS).

IN ADDITION,  WE USE MODIFIED EBITDA IN DEVELOPING OUR INTERNAL BUDGETS, FORECASTS AND STRATEGIC PLAN; IN ANALYZING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR  BUSINESS STRATEGIES IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS; MAKING COMPENSATION DECISIONS; AND IN COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR  BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONCERNING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. MODIFIED EBITDA HAS LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL, WHICH INCLUDES,  AMONG OTHERS, THE FOLLOWING.  \u25cf  MODIFIED  EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT OUR CASH EXPENDITURES, OR FUTURE REQUIREMENTS, FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS;  \u25cf  MODIFIED  EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT CHANGES IN, OR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR, OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS;  \u25cf  MODIFIED  EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT FUTURE INTEREST EXPENSE, OR THE CASH REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO SERVICE INTEREST OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS,  ON OUR DEBTS; AND  \u25cf  ALTHOUGH  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ARE NON-CASH CHARGES, THE ASSETS BEING DEPRECIATED AND AMORTIZED WILL OFTEN HAVE TO BE REPLACED  IN THE FUTURE, AND MODIFIED EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT ANY CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH REPLACEMENTS.  10  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE  ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. SUCH  ASSUMPTION CONTEMPLATES THE REALIZATION OF ASSETS AND SATISFACTION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET LOSS OF $3,264 AND USED CASH IN OPERATIONS OF $8,756. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD A CASH BALANCE OF $2,650 WITH BORROWING CAPACITY OF $6,826, A STOCKHOLDER\u2019S EQUITY OF $5,512 AND  A WORKING CAPITAL OF $9,101 COMPARED TO A CASH BALANCE OF $624 STOCKHOLDER\u2019S DEFICIT OF $6,743 AND WORKING CAPITAL SHORTFALL  OF $3,297 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. ON FEBRUARY 20, 2019, THE COMPANY CONDUCTED A PUBLIC OFFERING OF 7,733,750 SHARES OF ITS COMMON  STOCK AT $2.10 PER SHARE RESULTING TO NET PROCEEDS TO THE COMPANY OF $14,867.  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE FINANCED  OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SALES OF COMMON STOCK, ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED AND COMMON STOCK, CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS,  TERM LOANS AND CREDIT LINES FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. WE HAVE TAKEN DECISIVE ACTION TO  IMPROVE OUR MARGINS, INCLUDING FULLY OUTSOURCING OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS, STREAMLINING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO, NEGOTIATING IMPROVED  VENDOR CONTRACTS AND RESTRUCTURING OUR SELLING PRICES.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE  COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASU 2014-09, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606), (\u201cASC 606\u201d).  THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE OF ASC 606 IS TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS AT THE AMOUNT  EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. ASC 606 CREATES A FIVE-STEP MODEL THAT REQUIRES ENTITIES TO EXERCISE JUDGMENT WHEN CONSIDERING THE TERMS  OF CONTRACT(S), WHICH INCLUDE (1) IDENTIFYING THE CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT WITH A CUSTOMER, (2) IDENTIFYING OUR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS  IN THE CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT, (3) DETERMINING THE TRANSACTION PRICE, (4) ALLOCATING THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE SEPARATE PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATIONS, AND (5) RECOGNIZING REVENUE AS EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED.  THE  COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS REQUIRING PERFORMANCE BEYOND DELIVERY, AND CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  CONTAIN NO INCENTIVES OR DISCOUNTS THAT COULD CAUSE REVENUE TO BE ALLOCATED OR ADJUSTED OVER TIME. SHIPPING AND HANDLING ACTIVITIES  ARE PERFORMED BEFORE THE CUSTOMER OBTAINS CONTROL OF THE GOODS AND THEREFORE REPRESENT A FULFILLMENT ACTIVITY RATHER THAN A PROMISED  SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER. REVENUE AND COSTS OF SALES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PRODUCTS TRANSFERS TO OUR CUSTOMER, WHICH  GENERALLY OCCURS UPON SHIPMENT FROM OUR FACILITIES. THE COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED AT THAT TIME.  ALL  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS ARE OFFERED FOR SALE AS FINISHED GOODS ONLY, AND THERE ARE NO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS REQUIRED  POST-SHIPMENT FOR CUSTOMERS TO DERIVE THE EXPECTED VALUE FROM THEM.  THE  COMPANY DOES NOT ALLOW FOR RETURNS, EXCEPT FOR DAMAGED PRODUCTS WHEN THE DAMAGE OCCURRED PRE-FULFILLMENT. DAMAGED PRODUCT RETURNS  HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN INSIGNIFICANT. BECAUSE OF THIS, THE STAND-ALONE NATURE OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND OUR ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATIONS AND TRANSACTION PRICING FOR OUR SALES CONTRACTS, WE DO NOT CURRENTLY MAINTAIN A CONTRACT ASSET OR LIABILITY BALANCE  FOR OBLIGATIONS. WE ASSESS OUR CONTRACTS AND THE REASONABLENESS OF OUR CONCLUSIONS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.

WAS INCORPORATED IN SEPTEMBER 2018 TO SERVE AS A HOLDING COMPANY, AND PRIOR TO THE REORGANIZATION, HAD NO OPERATIONS, ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL AND OPERATING INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT, (I) ON AND AFTER SEPTEMBER 24, 2018, IS THAT OF ROAN INC., AND (II) PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 24, 2018, IS THE INFORMATION OF ROAN LLC, OUR ACCOUNTING PREDECESSOR.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT OIL AND NATURAL GAS COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR ASSETS THROUGHOUT THE EASTERN AND SOUTHERN ANADARKO BASIN. THE ANADARKO BASIN, WHICH SPANS FROM SOUTH-CENTRAL OKLAHOMA TO THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE TEXAS PANHANDLE, IS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST PROLIFIC ONSHORE OIL AND NATURAL GAS BASINS IN THE UNITED STATES, FEATURING MULTIPLE PRODUCING HORIZONS AND EXTENSIVE WELL PRODUCTION HISTORY DEMONSTRATED OVER SEVEN DECADES OF DEVELOPMENT. WE FOCUS OUR DEVELOPMENT ON FORMATIONS WHERE WE BELIEVE WE CAN APPLY OUR TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL EXPERTISE IN ORDER TO INCREASE PRODUCTION AND CASH FLOW TO DELIVER COMPELLING ECONOMIC RATES OF RETURN ON A RISK ADJUSTED BASIS. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO MAXIMIZE SHAREHOLDER VALUE AND CORPORATE RETURNS BY GENERATING STEADY PRODUCTION GROWTH, STRONG PRE-TAX MARGINS AND SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW. OUR ACREAGE POSITION IS CONCENTRATED IN AREAS THAT WE BELIEVE DEMONSTRATE HIGHER PERCENTAGE PRODUCTION OF OIL AND NGLS WITHIN THE MERGE PLAY AND PROVIDES US DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH MULTIPLE STACKED PROSPECTIVE DEVELOPMENT HORIZONS.  HOW WE EVALUATE OUR OPERATIONS  WE USE A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL METRICS TO ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR OIL AND NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  ACTUAL AND PROJECTED RESERVE AND PRODUCTION LEVELS;  \u2022  REALIZED PRICES ON THE SALE OF OIL, NATURAL GAS AND NGLS, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF OUR COMMODITY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS;  \u2022  LEASE OPERATING EXPENSES; AND  \u2022  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ON OUR OIL AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES.

ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY HAVE A DIRECT BEARING ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 1A \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 201  8.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  CLEARONE IS A GLOBAL COMPANY THAT DESIGNS, DEVELOPS AND SELLS CONFERENCING, COLLABORATION, AND AV NETWORKING SOLUTIONS FOR VOICE AND VISUAL COMMUNICATIONS. THE PERFORMANCE AND SIMPLICITY OF OUR ADVANCED, COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS OFFER A HIGH LEVEL OF FUNCTIONALITY, RELIABILITY AND SCALABILITY.  WE DERIVE A MAJOR PORTION OF OUR REVENUE FROM AUDIO CONFERENCING PRODUCTS AND MICROPHONES BY PROMOTING OUR PRODUCTS IN THE PROFESSIONAL AUDIO-VISUAL CHANNEL. WE HAVE EXTENDED OUR TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET FROM THE INSTALLED AUDIO CONFERENCING MARKET TO ADJACENT COMPLEMENTARY MARKETS \u2013 MICROPHONES, VIDEO COLLABORATION AND AV NETWORKING. WE HAVE ACHIEVED THIS THROUGH STRATEGIC TECHNOLOGICAL ACQUISITIONS AS WELL AS BY INTERNAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE BEGAN SHIPPING OUR PATENTED BEAMFORMING MICROPHONE ARRAY CEILING TILE (BMA CT) TO OUR PARTNERS.  ALL OF THE INNOVATIONS DEVELOPED FOR THE BMA CT MAKE THE INTEGRATOR\u2019S JOB EASIER AND MORE PROFITABLE. THE BMA CT DRAMATICALLY TRANSFORMS HOW INTEGRATORS CAN APPROACH SYSTEM DESIGN FOR CEILING TILE INSTALLATIONS, ALLOWING FOR MULTI-ARRAY SETUPS THAT CAN UTILIZE A SINGLE, LOW-CHANNEL COUNT DSP MIXER WHILE MAINTAINING CLEARONE\u2019S HIGH LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY. FURTHER SIMPLIFICATION COMES FROM THE ARRAY\u2019S BUILT-IN POWER AMPLIFIER, WHICH ALLOWS EACH ARRAY TO DRIVE TWO 10-WATT, 8-OHM LOUDSPEAKERS. THE BMA CT ALSO FEATURES CLEARONE\u2019S PROPRIETARY ADAPTIVE STEERING TECHNOLOGY (THINK OF IT AS SMART SWITCHING). THIS PROVIDES IMPECCABLE ROOM COVERAGE WHILE ELIMINATING THE NEED TO ADJUST INDIVIDUAL BEAMS. INTEGRATORS CAN DAISY CHAIN CEILING TILES VIA P-LINK (CLEARONE\u2019S PROPRIETARY PERIPHERAL LINK) FOR LARGER CONFERENCE SETUPS \u2013 FOR SIMPLER WIRING AND LONGER DISTANCES COMPARED TO NETWORKED HOME-RUN CONNECTIONS. P-LINK ALSO ALLOWS INTEGRATORS TO DAISY CHAIN ADDITIONAL PERIPHERALS SUCH AS WIRELESS MICS, USB EXPANDERS, AND GPIO EXPANDERS.  THE SYSTEM SUPPORTS ALL OF THIS FUNCTIONALITY WITH ZERO CONSUMPTION OF ANALOG I/O AND SIGNAL PROCESSING IN THE DSP MIXER LEAVING THOSE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR OTHER NEEDS.  WE ALSO INTRODUCED COLLABORATE  \u00ae  SPACE TO OUR GROWING FAMILY OF COLLABORATION SOLUTIONS.  IT\u2019S A SUITE THAT UNIFIES MESSAGING, CALLS AND MEETINGS AND WILL ENERGIZE WORKFLOWS AND INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED IN THE ENTERPRISE. DESIGNED AS A PERSISTENT, USER-FRIENDLY COLLABORATION SUITE, COLLABORATE SPACE CONTAINS MANY POWERFUL UCC CAPABILITIES, AS WELL AS THE SEAMLESS ABILITY TO MAKE CALLS OUTSIDE THE NETWORK.  WITH COLLABORATE SPACE, USERS CAN WORK TOGETHER ONE-ON-ONE, OR IN GROUPS OF HUNDREDS, WITH INTEGRATED FILE SHARING, SEARCHABLE ARCHIVES, AND USER PRESENCE INFORMATION. THEY CAN CONNECT WITH COLLEAGUES AND CONTACTS, VIA AUDIO AND VIDEO, WITH THE MOST INTUITIVE COLLABORATION TOOLS. USERS CAN MEET IMMEDIATELY OR SCHEDULE A MEETING AND ACCESS A FULL SUITE OF COLLABORATION FEATURES, INCLUDING FILE SHARING, WHITEBOARDING, ANNOTATION, CHAT, AND MEETING MINUTES.  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER, WE CONTINUED OUR SERIOUS LITIGATION EFFORTS TO STOP INFRINGEMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC PATENTS. WE ALSO CONTINUE OUR PROGRAMS TO CUT COSTS AND TO SPEED UP PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ENABLE US TO GET BACK TO A GROWTH PATH.  OVERALL REVENUE DECLINED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WHEN COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WITH DECLINES SEEN IN ALL PRODUCT CATEGORIES EXCEPT VIDEO. WE BELIEVE THE ON-GOING INFRINGEMENT OF CLEARONE\u2019S PATENTS IS THE MAJOR CAUSE OF OUR REVENUE DECLINE IN THE AUDIO CONFERENCING AND MICROPHONES CATEGORIES.  OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 43% DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 FROM 56% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018. GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED OVERHEAD ABSORPTION INTO INVENTORY AS WE CONTINUE TO REDUCE OUR NET SPEND ON INVENTORY.  NET LOSS INCREASED FROM $1.8 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 TO $2.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THE INCREASE IN NET LOSS IN 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED GROSS PROFIT AND REDUCED TAX BENEFIT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCTION IN OPERATING EXPENSES.  INDUSTRY CONDITIONS  WE OPERATE IN A VERY DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY WHICH IS DOMINATED ON THE ONE HAND BY A FEW PLAYERS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN PRODUCTS LIKE TRADITIONAL VIDEO CONFERENCING APPLIANCES WHILE ON THE OTHER INFLUENCED HEAVILY BY A FRAGMENTED RESELLER MARKET CONSISTING OF NUMEROUS REGIONAL AND LOCAL PLAYERS. THE INDUSTRY IS ALSO CHARACTERIZED BY VENTURE CAPITALIST FUNDED START-UPS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES WILLING TO FUND CUMULATIVE CASH LOSSES IN ORDER TO GAIN MARKET SHARE AND ACHIEVE CERTAIN NON-FINANCIAL GOALS.  ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES AND RISKS  THE AUDIO-VISUAL PRODUCTS MARKET IS CHARACTERIZED BY INTENSE COMPETITION AND RAPIDLY EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY. OUR COMPETITORS VARY WITHIN EACH PRODUCT CATEGORY. OUR INSTALLED PROFESSIONAL AUDIO CONFERENCING PRODUCTS, WHICH IS OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCT CATEGORY, CONTINUE TO BE AHEAD OF THE COMPETITION DESPITE THE REDUCTION IN REVENUES. OUR STRENGTH IN THIS SPACE IS LARGELY DUE TO OUR FULLY INTEGRATED SUITE OF PRODUCTS CONSISTING OF DSP MIXERS, WIDE RANGE OF PROFESSIONAL MICROPHONE PRODUCTS AND VIDEO COLLABORATION PRODUCTS. DESPITE OUR STRONG LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE INSTALLED PROFESSIONAL AUDIO CONFERENCING MARKET, WE FACE CHALLENGES TO REVENUE GROWTH DUE TO THE LIMITED SIZE OF THE MARKET AND PRICING PRESSURES FROM NEW COMPETITORS ATTRACTED TO THE COMMERCIAL MARKET DUE TO HIGHER MARGINS.  REVENUE FROM OUR VIDEO PRODUCTS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH. WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN THIS MARKET FROM WELL-ESTABLISHED MARKET LEADERS AS WELL AS EMERGING PLAYERS RICH WITH MARKETING FUNDS. WE EXPECT OUR STRATEGY OF COMBINING SPONTANIA, OUR CLOUD-BASED VIDEO CONFERENCING PRODUCT, COLLABORATE, OUR APPLIANCE-BASED MEDIA COLLABORATION PRODUCT, OUR HIGH-QUALITY PROFESSIONAL CAMERAS, AND OUR HIGH-END AUDIO CONFERENCING TECHNOLOGY WILL GENERATE HIGH GROWTH IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WE BELIEVE WE ARE ALSO WELL POSITIONED TO CAPITALIZE ON THE CONTINUING MIGRATION AWAY FROM THE TRADITIONAL HARDWARE-BASED VIDEO CONFERENCING SYSTEMS TO SOFTWARE-BASED VIDEO CONFERENCING APPLICATIONS.  WE DERIVE A MAJOR PORTION OF OUR REVENUE (APPROXIMATELY 47% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018) FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE. MOST OF OUR REVENUE FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS BILLED IN U.S. DOLLARS AND IS NOT EXPOSED TO ANY SIGNIFICANT CURRENCY RISK. HOWEVER, WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK IF THE U.S. DOLLAR IS STRONG AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES AS IT WILL MAKE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS LESS COMPETITIVE.  A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOLLOWS BELOW.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH CERTAIN ITEMS FROM OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 (\u201c2019-Q1\u201d) AND 2018 (\u201c2018-Q1\u201d), RESPECTIVELY, TOGETHER WITH THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE WHICH EACH SUCH ITEM REPRESENTS.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  2019-Q1  2018-Q1  PERCENTAGE CHANGE 2019-Q1 VS 2018-Q1  REVENUE  $6,305  $7,289  -13%  COST OF GOODS SOLD  3,601  3,190  -13%  GROSS PROFIT  2,704  4,099  -34%  SALES AND MARKETING  1,953  2,868  -32%  RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT  1,587  2,056  -23%  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  1,555  1,617  -4%  OPERATING LOSS  (2,391  )  (2,442  )  2%  OTHER INCOME, NET  42  24  75%  LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAXES  (2,349  )  (2,418  )  3%  PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES  -  (572  )  -100%  NET LOSS  $(2,349  )  $(1,846  )  -27%  REVENUE  OUR REVENUE DECREASED TO $6.3 MILLION IN 2019 COMPARED TO $7.3 MILLION IN 2018. THE HIGHEST DECLINE WAS SEEN IN AUDIO CONFERENCING CATEGORY WITH 11% DECLINE FOLLOWED BY MICROPHONES WITH 9% DECLINE. REVENUE FROM VIDEO PRODUCTS GREW BY 13% ON THE BACK OF GROWTH IN SALES OF VIDEOCONFERENCING APPLIANCES, CAMERAS AND CLOUD-BASED VIDEOCONFERENCING SERVICES. THE DECLINE IN AUDIO CONFERENCING CATEGORY WAS DUE TO DECLINE IN ALL SUBCATEGORIES INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL INSTALLED AUDIO CONFERENCING, PERSONAL CONFERENCING AND TABLETOP CONFERENCING. THE DECLINE IN MICROPHONES CATEGORY WAS DUE TO DECLINE IN BEAMFORMING MICROPHONES. THE ON-GOING INFRINGEMENT OF CLEARONE\u2019S PATENTS IS THE MAJOR CAUSE OF OUR REVENUE DECLINE IN AUDIO CONFERENCING AND MICROPHONES CATEGORIES.  THE SHARE OF AUDIO CONFERENCING PRODUCTS IN OUR PRODUCT MIX DECLINED MARGINALLY FROM 50% IN 2018-Q1 TO 43% IN 2019-Q1. THE SHARE OF MICROPHONES SLIGHTLY IMPROVED FROM 32% TO 33%. SHARE OF VIDEO PRODUCTS IN THE REVENUE MIX INCREASED FROM 18% TO 24%.  DURING 2019-Q1 REVENUE DECLINED ACROSS ALL MAJOR MARKETS EXCEPT MIDDLE EAST, INDIA AND CENTRAL EUROPE. THE DECLINE WAS MORE PRONOUNCED IN THE CANADA, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN AND NORTHERN EUROPE. ASIA PACIFIC INCLUDING MIDDLE EAST DECREASED BY 9%, EUROPE AND AFRICA DECLINED BY 14% AND AMERICAS DECLINED BY 13%.  WE BELIEVE, ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, THAT WE WILL RETURN TO GROWTH PATH WHEN OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES NAMELY PRODUCT INNOVATION, COST REDUCTION AND DEFENSE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SUCCEED.  COSTS OF GOODS SOLD AND GROSS PROFIT  COST OF GOODS SOLD (\u201cCOGS\u201d) INCLUDES EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH FINISHED GOODS PURCHASED FROM OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURERS, THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS (INCLUDING MATERIAL AND DIRECT LABOR), OUR MANUFACTURING AND OPERATIONS ORGANIZATION, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT DEPRECIATION, WARRANTY EXPENSE, FREIGHT EXPENSE, ROYALTY PAYMENTS, AND THE ALLOCATION OF OVERHEAD EXPENSES.  OUR GROSS PROFIT FOR 2019-Q1 WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.7 MILLION OR 43% COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $4.1 MILLION, OR 56%, FOR 2018-Q1. GROSS MARGIN FOR 2019-Q1 DECLINED MAINLY DUE TO REDUCED OVERHEAD ABSORPTION INTO INVENTORY DUE TO CONTINUED DECLINED IN INVENTORY PURCHASING ACTIVITY.  OUR PROFITABILITY IN THE NEAR-TERM CONTINUES TO DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR REVENUES FROM PROFESSIONAL INSTALLED AUDIO CONFERENCING PRODUCTS. WE HOLD LONG-TERM INVENTORY AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SELL OUR LONG-TERM INVENTORY, OUR PROFITABILITY MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS AND PRICE MARK-DOWNS.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OPERATING EXPENSES  OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE SALES AND MARKETING (\u201cS&M\u201d) EXPENSES, RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT (\u201cR&D\u201d) EXPENSES AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cG&A\u201d) EXPENSES. TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $5.1 MILLION FOR 2019-Q1 COMPARED TO $6.5 MILLION FOR 2018-Q1. THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF EXPENSES RELATED TO SALES AND MARKETING, RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE, AND OTHER ITEMS.  SALES AND MARKETING  - S&M EXPENSES INCLUDE SELLING, CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND MARKETING EXPENSES SUCH AS EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS, ALLOCATIONS OF OVERHEAD EXPENSES, TRADE SHOWS, AND OTHER ADVERTISING AND SELLING EXPENSES.  S&M EXPENSES FOR 2019-Q1 DECREASED TO $2.0 MILLION FROM $2.9 MILLION FOR 2018-Q1. THE DECREASE WAS MAINLY DUE TO DECREASES IN EMPLOYEE RELATED COSTS, MARKETING EXPENSES RELATED TO TRADESHOWS, INVENTORY COSTS FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES AND COMMISSION PAYMENTS.  RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT  - R&D EXPENSES INCLUDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCT LINE MANAGEMENT, ENGINEERING SERVICES, AND TEST AND APPLICATION EXPENSES, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE RELATED COSTS, OUTSIDE SERVICES, EXPENSED MATERIALS, DEPRECIATION, AND AN ALLOCATION OF OVERHEAD EXPENSES.  R&D EXPENSES WERE APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION FOR 2019-Q1, AS COMPARED TO $2.1 MILLION FOR 2018-Q1. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN EMPLOYEE RELATED COSTS AND ALLOCATIONS OF OVERHEAD EXPENSES.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  - G&A EXPENSES INCLUDE EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS, PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FEES, ALLOCATIONS OF OVERHEAD EXPENSES, LITIGATION COSTS, AND CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, INCLUDING COSTS RELATED TO FINANCE AND HUMAN RESOURCES.  G&A EXPENSES REMAINED ALMOST THE SAME AT $1.6 MILLION IN 2019-Q1 AND 2018-Q1.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET, INCLUDES INTEREST INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY CHANGES.  OTHER INCOME MARGINALLY INCREASED IN 2019-Q1 COMPARED TO HIGHER INTEREST INCOME.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  DURING 2019-Q1, WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY BENEFIT FROM THE LOSSES INCURRED DUE TO SETTING UP OF FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE. DURING 2018-Q1 WE ACCRUED INCOME TAXES AT THE FORECASTED EFFECTIVE TAX BENEFIT RATE OF 27.0%  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $4.3 MILLION COMPARED TO $11.2 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018. OUR WORKING CAPITAL WAS $22.9 MILLION AND $28.3 MILLION AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION IN 2019-Q1, AN INCREASE OF CASH USED OF APPROXIMATELY $1.0 MILLION FROM $0.3 MILLION OF CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2018-Q1. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CASH OUTFLOWS DUE TO CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $1.2 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN NET LOSS BY $0.5 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASE IN NON-CASH CHARGES OF $0.7 MILLION.  NET CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $5.6 MILLION FOR 2019-Q1 COMPARED TO NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $1.0 MILLION DURING THE 2018-Q1, AN INCREASE IN CASH USED OF $6.6 MILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $6.8 MILLION.  CAPITALIZATION OF PATENT DEFENSE COSTS  . WE CAPITALIZE EXTERNAL LEGAL COSTS INCURRED IN THE DEFENSE OF OUR PATENTS WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT A SIGNIFICANT, DISCERNIBLE INCREASE IN VALUE WILL RESULT FROM THE DEFENSE AND A SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THE LEGAL ACTION IS PROBABLE. WHEN WE CAPITALIZE PATENT DEFENSE COSTS WE AMORTIZE THE COSTS OVER THE REMAINING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE PATENT, WHICH IS 15 TO 17 YEARS. DURING 2019-Q1 WE SPENT $1.2 MILLION OF LEGAL COSTS RELATED TO THE DEFENSE OF OUR PATENTS AND CAPITALIZED THE ENTIRE AMOUNT.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $9 THOUSAND DURING 2019-Q1. NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.7 MILLION DURING 2018-Q1, WHICH CONSISTED OF CASH OUTFLOWS OF $0.1 MILLION ON REPURCHASE AND CANCELLATION OF STOCK AND $0.6 MILLION FOR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.  WE ARE CURRENTLY PURSUING ALL AVAILABLE LEGAL REMEDIES TO DEFEND OUR STRATEGIC PATENTS FROM INFRINGEMENT. WE HAVE ALREADY SPENT ABOUT $9.7 MILLION FROM 2016 THROUGH MARCH 31, 2019 TOWARDS THIS LITIGATION AND MAY BE REQUIRED TO SPEND MORE TO CONTINUE OUR LEGAL DEFENSE. WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PRESERVING CASH BY SUSPENDING OUR DIVIDEND PROGRAM, ALLOWING THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO EXPIRE AND IMPLEMENTING COMPANY-WIDE COST REDUCTION MEASURES. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL CASH AS OUR INVENTORY LEVELS ARE BROUGHT DOWN TO HISTORICAL LEVELS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE MEASURES TAKEN BY US WILL YIELD HIGHER REVENUES IN THE FUTURE. WE BELIEVE ALL OF THESE AND EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL WILL PROVIDE THE LIQUIDITY NEEDED TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FINANCE OUR GROWTH PLANS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT OUR STRONG PORTFOLIO OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OUR SOLID BRAND EQUITY IN THE MARKET WILL ENABLE US TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IF AND WHEN NEEDED TO MEET OUR SHORT AND LONG-TERM FINANCING NEEDS. IN ADDITION TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WE MAY USE CASH IN THE NEAR FUTURE FOR SELECTIVE INFUSIONS OF TECHNOLOGY, SALES AND MARKETING, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND OTHER INVESTMENTS TO FUEL OUR GROWTH.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS RELATED TO OUR ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURING SERVICE PROVIDERS OF APPROXIMATELY $2.1 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INVENTORY PURCHASES.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD INVENTORY TOTALING $20.8 MILLION, OF WHICH NON-CURRENT INVENTORY ACCOUNTED FOR $8.5 MILLION. THIS COMPARES TO TOTAL INVENTORIES OF $22.2 MILLION AND NON-CURRENT INVENTORY OF $9.0 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITIONS, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDITY.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  ASC 606  ON OCTOBER 1, 2018, WE ADOPTED ASC TOPIC 606,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (\"ASC 606\"), USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. UNDER THIS METHOD, WE RECOGNIZED THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF APPLYING THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD TO EXISTING REVENUE CONTRACTS THAT WERE ACTIVE AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF ACCUMULATED DEFICIT. THE REPORTED RESULTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  REFLECT THE ADOPTION OF ASC 606, WHILE THE COMPARATIVE INFORMATION HAS NOT BEEN RESTATED AND CONTINUES TO BE REPORTED UNDER THE RELATED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IN EFFECT FOR THOSE PERIODS. REFER TO NOTE 6 TO THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION OF ASC 606 AS OF AND FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.

Q1-2019  COMPARED TO  Q1-2018  REVENUE IN  Q1-2019  DECREASED  $1.4 MILLION  , OR  16%  TO  $7.5 MILLION  , FROM  Q1-2018  REVENUE OF  $8.9 MILLION  . REVENUE CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  PRODUCT AND OTHER REVENUE FROM SALE OF MEDIASITE RECORDER UNITS AND SERVER SOFTWARE WAS  $1.8 MILLION  IN  Q1-2019  AND  $3.1 MILLION  IN  Q1-2018  .  AVERAGE SELLING PRICE WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER IN  Q1-2019  AS COMPARED TO  Q1-2018  PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF HIGH SALES VOLUME FOR A NEW LOW-COST RECORDER OPTION THAT WAS INTRODUCED LATE IN Q4-2017. RECORDERS SOLD WERE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN Q1-2018, PARTIALLY AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY'S PLANNED REDUCTION OF DISTRIBUTION INVENTORY WHICH HAD AN IMPACT OF $670 THOUSAND.

THE COMPANY HAS OVER 40 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE ACTING AS A DISTRIBUTOR TO U.S. MILITARY COMMISSARIES AND EXCHANGES. THE COMPANY IS THE EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE SUPPLIER OF PRIVATE BRAND PRODUCTS TO U.S. MILITARY COMMISSARIES AND IS CONTINUING TO PARTNER WI  TH DECA IN THE ROLLOUT OF PRIVATE BRAND PRODUCTS TO MILITARY COMMISSARIES WHICH BEGAN DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017.  AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER, THE COMPANY\u2019S RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATED 159 CORPORATE OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE MIDWEST REGION PRIMARILY UNDER THE BANNERS OF  FAMILY FARE, MARTIN\u2019S SUPER MARKETS, VG\u2019S FOOD AND PHARMACY, D&W FRESH MARKETS, SUN MART  AND  FAMILY FRESH MARKET.  THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS PHARMACY SERVICES IN 99 OF ITS CORPORATE OWNED RETAIL STORES AND OPERATES 37 FUEL CENTERS. THE RETAIL STORES HAVE A \u201cNEIGHBORHOOD MARKET\u201d FOCUS TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM SUPERCENTERS AND LIMITED ASSORTMENT STORES.  ALL FISCAL QUARTERS ARE 12 WEEKS, EXCEPT FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S FIRST QUARTER, WHICH IS 16 WEEKS AND WILL GENERALLY INCLUDE THE EASTER HOLIDAY. THE FOURTH QUARTER INCLUDES THE THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS, AND DEPENDING ON THE FISCAL YEAR END, MAY INCLUDE THE NEW YEAR\u2019S HOLIDAY.

MANY STORES ARE DEPENDENT ON TOURISM AND THEREFORE, ARE MOST AFFECTED BY SEASONS AND WEATHER PATTERNS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF SNOWFALL DURING THE WINTER MONTHS AND THE RANGE OF TEMPERATURE DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS.  2019 FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED APRIL 20, 2019, THE COMPANY MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND BETTER POSITIONED ITSELF FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. IN LINE WITH ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE TO ACHIEVE MID-SINGLE DIGIT SALES GROWTH, THE COMPANY REALIZED AN INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED NET SALES OF 6.6% COMPARED WITH THE QUARTER ENDED APRIL 21, 2018. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER WAS DRIVEN BY THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S SUPER MARKETS, INC. (\u201cMARTIN\u2019S\u201d), AS WELL AS SALES GROWTH IN THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION AND MILITARY DISTRIBUTION SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON ITS OTHER TOP OBJECTIVES FOR THE CURRENT YEAR, INCLUDING STRENGTHENING ITS MANAGEMENT TEAM, SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS, GENERATING  IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH ITS PROJECT ONE TEAM INITIATIVE, AND REDUCING ITS DEBT, WORKING CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL LEVERAGE RATIOS, WHICH WILL ALL CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVED GROWTH IN ADJUSTED OPERATING EARNINGS AND ADJUSTED EBITDA.  FIRST QUARTER 2019 OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE.  \u2022  THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT REALIZED SALES GROWTH OF 1.2% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. BEFORE THE IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY SALES TO MARTIN\u2019S, SALES INCREASED 5.2%, DRIVEN LARGELY BY SALES TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON PARTNERING WITH INDEPENDENT RETAILERS TO SUPPORT THEIR OPERATIONS AND ENHANCE THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE.  \u2022  LATE IN THE FIRST QUARTER, THE COMPANY INITIATED A VOLUNTARY PRODUCT RECALL FOR FRESH-CUT MELON PRODUCTS PRODUCED AT THE CAITO FACILITY IN INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA DUE TO POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE RECALL, THE COMPANY TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED PRODUCTION OF THE RECALLED PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON PRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION AND SPECIFICALLY WITHIN ITS FRESH CUT FRUIT AND VEGETABLE OPERATIONS. TESTING WAS PERFORMED WITHIN THE MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT BY THIRD PARTY FOOD SAFETY EXPERTS AS WELL AS THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) AND NO EVIDENCE OF CONTAMINATION WAS DETECTED, A PROCESS WHICH INCLUDED OVER 1,000 TESTS AMONG THE VARIOUS PARTIES. THE COMPANY IS WORKING TO IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL TESTING OF INCOMING PRODUCT TO FURTHER ENHANCE ITS FOOD SAFETY PROTOCOLS.  \u2022  THE MILITARY SEGMENT CONTINUED TO SUPPORT DECA IN THE EXPANSION OF ITS PRIVATE BRAND PROGRAM, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO SALES GROWTH IN THE QUARTER. THE COMPANY ALSO GAINED INCREMENTAL SALES WITH AN EXISTING CUSTOMER WHICH OFFSET THE CHALLENGES OF OPERATING IN A COMMISSARY ENVIRONMENT WHICH CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE  NEGATIVE SALES TRENDS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE DISTRIBUTION CENTER THAT EXPERIENCED OPERATIONAL ISSUES IN LATE 2018 AND INTO THE BEGINNING OF 2019. THE COMPANY HAS MADE KEY LEADERSHIP CHANGES AND IMPLEMENTED ENHANCEMENTS TO ITS PROCESSES AND CONTROLS. BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER, THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER\u2019S PERFORMANCE WAS STABILIZED, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE METRICS AND PROFITABILITY RETURNED TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN ITS EXECUTION OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S NEW RETAIL BRAND POSITIONING. SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER, THE COMPANY UNVEILED THE REMODEL OF 18 STORES IN MICHIGAN. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BEGIN REALIZING THE BENEFIT OF THESE INVESTMENTS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2019. THESE INVESTMENTS SUPPORT THE COMPANY\u2019S OBJECTIVES RELATED TO BRAND REPOSITIONING AND IT EXPECTS THAT THEY WILL HELP IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN FISCAL 2019 COMPARABLE STORE SALES.  18  \u2022  THE COMPANY  CLOSED ON THE ACQUISITION OF  MARTIN\u2019S IN EARLY 2019. MARTIN\u2019S IS A LEADING MIDWEST INDEPENDENT SUPERMARKET CHAIN WHICH OPERATES 21 STORES IN NORTHERN INDIANA AND  SOUTHWESTERN MICHIGAN. THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S HAS CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN SALES AND OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT  AND WILL CONTINUE TO COMPLEMENT THE COMPANY\u2019S EXISTING RETAIL INITIATIVES.  \u2022  THE COMPANY CONTINUED ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH A THIRD-PARTY ADVISORY FIRM ON A COMPANY-WIDE INITIATIVE, PROJECT ONE TEAM, DESIGNED TO TRANSFORM ITS CULTURE AND EMPOWER ASSOCIATES AT ALL LEVELS TO DRIVE SUBSTANTIAL ONGOING, SUSTAINABLE IMPROVEMENTS TO BUSINESS PROCESSES AND RESULTS. THE COMPANY SET AN INITIAL GOAL TO REALIZE AN ANNUAL RUN RATE OF AT LEAST $15 MILLION IN SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT 24 MONTHS FROM THIS INITIATIVE. THE COMPANY IS ON ITS WAY TO EXCEEDING THIS OBJECTIVE BY IDENTIFYING OVER $20 MILLION IN ANNUAL RUN RATE SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH THE COMPANY WILL IMPLEMENT OVER THE  NEXT 24 MONTHS.  THE EFFECT OF IMPLEMENTING THESE OPPORTUNITIES IS NOT CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN 2019.  \u2022  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER, THE COMPANY APPOINTED A NEW CHIEF MERCHANDISING AND MARKETING OFFICER, CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER AND SEVERAL OTHER KEY ADDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE IT AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS. OTHER STRATEGIC ADDITIONS TO THE MANAGEMENT TEAM AT VARIOUS LEVELS ARE IN PROCESS AS PART OF A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED PLAN TO STRENGTHEN THE MANAGEMENT TEAM, SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS.  \u2022  ADJUSTED FOR THE FUNDING OF THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY PAID DOWN OVER $20 MILLION IN DEBT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE COMPANY ALSO REDUCED ITS INVENTORY LEVELS BY OVER 2% FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WITHOUT NEGATIVELY IMPACTING CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS, DESPITE CONTINUED SALES GROWTH. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON DEBT AND WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019, THE COMPANY EXPECTS FOOD DISTRIBUTION TO ACHIEVE LOW- TO MID-SINGLE DIGIT SALES GROWTH DRIVEN BY EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND NEW BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SOME ATTRITION IN THE INDEPENDENT RETAIL BASE. THIS EXPECTATION EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY SALES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE MARTIN\u2019S BUSINESS, ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $150 TO $170 MILLION. IN THE MILITARY SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT NEW BUSINESS WITHIN THE SEGMENT, INCLUDING CONTINUED PRIVATE BRAND GROWTH, WILL LARGELY OFFSET THE NEGATIVE DECA COMPARABLE SALES TREND. WITHIN THE RETAIL SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TOTAL SALES WILL INCREASE DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S AND THE SIGNIFICANT CURRENT YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BRAND POSITIONING, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF STORE RATIONALIZATION PLANS. MARTIN\u2019S IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $475 MILLION TO $500 MILLION IN RETAIL SEGMENT NET SALES. FROM A PROFITABILITY PERSPECTIVE, THE EXPECTED NET SALES INCREASES WILL BE OFFSET BY CHALLENGES PRIMARILY WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN ENVIRONMENT, WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO NAVIGATE HISTORICALLY TIGHT LABOR MARKETS AND A HIGHER COST OF TRANSPORTATION. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS LESS CONTRIBUTION FROM THE FRESH KITCHEN OPERATIONS THAN INITIALLY ANTICIPATED AND HAS ENGAGED OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS TO WORK WITH THE SPARTANNASH TEAM TO GENERATE PROFITABILITY IN THIS BUSINESS. THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF THESE OPERATIONS IN THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT AND IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT AND, AS SUCH, THE IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE KEY TO THE COMPANY\u2019S OBJECTIVES IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

THE INCREASES WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREMENTAL SALES FROM THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION AND ORGANIC GROWTH FROM EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION AND MILITARY SEGMENTS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET LOWER ORGANIC SALES IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT.  FOOD DISTRIBUTION NET SALES, AFTER INTERCOMPANY ELIMINATIONS, INCREASED $14.0 MILLION, OR 1.2%, TO $1.17 BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER FROM $1.16 BILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. BEFORE THE IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF SALES TO MARTIN\u2019S, WHICH BECAME A CORPORATE OWNED RETAIL STORE FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S AT THE BEGINNING OF 2019, SALES GREW 5.2%.  MILITARY NET SALES INCREASED $7.8 MILLION, OR 1.2%, TO $671.4 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER FROM $663.6 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL VOLUME FROM NEW BUSINESS WITH AN EXISTING CUSTOMER THAT COMMENCED LATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND GROWTH IN DECA\u2019S PRIVATE BRAND PROGRAM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMPARABLE SALES AT DECA OPERATED LOCATIONS.  RETAIL NET SALES INCREASED $135.5 MILLION, OR 23.9%, TO $701.8 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER FROM $566.2 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREMENTAL SALES FROM THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF MARTIN\u2019S, SALES DECREASED 3.0%, AS A RESULT OF STORE CLOSURES AND A DECREASE IN FUEL PRICES PER GALLON. COMPARABLE STORE SALES, EXCLUDING FUEL, DECREASED 0.3% FOR THE QUARTER AND REFLECT CONTINUED STRONG COMPETITION WITHIN THE INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY DEFINES A RETAIL STORE AS COMPARABLE WHEN IT IS IN OPERATION FOR 14 ACCOUNTING PERIODS (A PERIOD EQUALS FOUR WEEKS), REGARDLESS OF REMODELS, EXPANSIONS OR RELOCATED STORES. THE COMPANY\u2019S DEFINITION OF COMPARABLE STORE SALES MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES AT OTHER COMPANIES.

A 5.6% INCREASE IN THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND RATE FROM $0.18 PER SHARE TO $0.19 PER SHARE WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ANNOUNCED ON FEBRUARY 28, 2019. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO PAY A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND, ADOPTION OF A DIVIDEND POLICY DOES NOT COMMIT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO DECLARE FUTURE DIVIDENDS. EACH FUTURE DIVIDEND WILL BE CONSIDERED AND DECLARED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT ITS DISCRETION. WHETHER THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONTINUES TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION, ANTICIPATED PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF ITS CREDIT FACILITIES.  UNDER THE SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE COMPANY IS GENERALLY PERMITTED TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN ANY FISCAL YEAR UP TO AN AMOUNT SUCH THAT ALL CASH DIVIDENDS, TOGETHER WITH ANY CASH DISTRIBUTIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, DO NOT EXCEED $35.0 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS GENERALLY PERMITTED TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE SHARES IN EXCESS OF $35.0 MILLION IN ANY FISCAL YEAR SO LONG AS ITS EXCESS AVAILABILITY, AS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, IS IN EXCESS OF 10% OF THE TOTAL BORROWING BASE, AS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, BEFORE AND AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY HAS ALSO MADE CERTAIN COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS THAT EXTEND BEYOND APRIL 20, 2019. THESE COMMITMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PURCHASE COMMITMENTS (AS DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018), STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT OF $13.1 MILLION AS OF APRIL 20, 2019, AND INTEREST ON LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, THE COMPANY EVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO BAD DEBTS, INVENTORIES, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCOME TAXES, SELF-INSURANCE RESERVES, RESTRUCTURING COSTS, RETIREMENT BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT MAY NOT BE READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S ONGOING REVIEW, THE COMPANY MAKES ADJUSTMENTS IT CONSIDERS APPROPRIATE UNDER THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF  $249 MILLION  FULLY OFFSETS THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RESULTING FROM THE STATE NOL CARRYFORWARDS THAT EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH 2037.  IN ASSESSING THE NEED FOR THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WE CONSIDERED BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE RELATED TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF REALIZATION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  AS A RESULT OF OUR PERIODIC ASSESSMENT, OUR ESTIMATE OF THE REALIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IS SOLELY BASED ON THE FUTURE REVERSALS OF EXISTING TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES AND TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES THAT WE WOULD MAKE USE OF TO ACCELERATE TAXABLE INCOME TO UTILIZE EXPIRING NOL AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS.  ACCORDINGLY, IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  , THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE NET INCREASE OF  $23 MILLION  CONSISTED OF  $35 MILLION  TO OFFSET THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS CREATED IN THE QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN NOL CARRYFORWARDS,  $3 MILLION  WHICH OFFSETS THE TAX BENEFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LOSS RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS), OFFSET BY A  $15 MILLION  BENEFIT RELATED TO LEASE ACCOUNTING.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  WE REPORT OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  HOWEVER, WE PRESENT CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES IDENTIFIED AS NON-GAAP UNDER THE RULES OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) TO ASSESS OUR RESULTS.  WE BELIEVE THE PRESENTATION OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IS USEFUL IN ORDER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS TO FACILITATE THE COMPARISON OF OUR RESULTS TO THE RESULTS OF OUR PEER COMPANIES.  IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT USES THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO ASSESS THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO VIEW NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN ADDITION TO, RATHER THAN AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, THOSE MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  WE HAVE PROVIDED RECONCILIATIONS OF THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURES TO OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED.  THE FOLLOWING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE RESTRUCTURING AND MANAGEMENT TRANSITION CHARGES, OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COST/(INCOME), THE (GAIN)/LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT AND THE TAX IMPACT FOR THE ALLOCATION OF INCOME TAXES TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ITEMS RELATED TO OUR PENSION PLANS AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OVERVIEW  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ACCESS TO OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  OUR CASH FLOWS MAY BE IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS INCLUDING THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS IN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR STRATEGIES.  WE ENDED THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  WITH  $171 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  AS OF THE END OF THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  , BASED ON OUR BORROWING BASE, OUR CURRENT BORROWINGS AND AMOUNTS RESERVED FOR OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT, WE HAD  $1,556 MILLION  AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, PROVIDING TOTAL AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY OF  $1,727 MILLION.

FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP)  FREE CASH FLOW IS A KEY FINANCIAL MEASURE OF OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL CASH FROM OPERATING OUR BUSINESS AND IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  WE DEFINE FREE CASH FLOW AS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, LESS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  PLUS THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF OPERATING ASSETS.  FREE CASH FLOW IS A RELEVANT INDICATOR OF OUR ABILITY TO REPAY MATURING DEBT, REVISE OUR DIVIDEND POLICY OR FUND OTHER USES OF CAPITAL THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ENHANCE STOCKHOLDER VALUE.  FREE CASH FLOW IS CONSIDERED A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE UNDER THE RULES OF THE SEC.  FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT REMAINING CASH FLOW AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MEASURE DOES NOT DEDUCT PAYMENTS REQUIRED FOR DEBT MATURITIES, PAYMENTS MADE FOR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS OR REQUIRED PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS, IF ANY.  THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO VIEW FREE CASH FLOW IN ADDITION TO, RATHER THAN AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OUR ENTIRE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND THOSE MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES  WHILE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SALES, PROFIT AND OPERATING CASH FLOWS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN REALIZED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, OUR QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, INVENTORY LEVELS AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  IMPROVED  $149 MILLION  TO AN  OUTFLOW  OF  $205 MILLION  COMPARED TO AN  OUTFLOW  OF  $354 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPROVEMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND A DECREASE IN THE VOLUME OF INVENTORY PURCHASES.  CASH FLOW OUTLOOK  FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019  , WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING LIQUIDITY WILL BE ADEQUATE TO FUND OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS; HOWEVER, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR LONG-TERM FINANCING STRATEGY, WE MAY ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS OPPORTUNISTICALLY.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL POSITION WILL PROVIDE US THE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO SUPPORT OUR CURRENT INITIATIVES.  CREDIT RATINGS  OUR CREDIT RATINGS AND OUTLOOK AS OF  MAY 24, 2019  FROM VARIOUS CREDIT RATING AGENCIES WERE AS FOLLOWS.

WITH A SIZABLE PORTION OF OUR PRIVATE AND NATIONAL BRANDED APPAREL SOURCED FROM CHINA, WE ARE EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL INCREASES IN PRODUCT COSTS WHICH MAY RESULT FROM INCREASED TARIFFS IMPOSED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN CONNECTION WITH ITS TRADE DISPUTES WITH CHINA. WE EXPECT A MINIMAL IMPACT ON OUR PRODUCT COSTS BASED ON THE CURRENT TARIFFS THAT ARE IN EFFECT AND HAVE TAKEN ACTIONS TO DIVERSIFY OUR SOURCING OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, WE CAN EXPECT A MORE MEANINGFUL INCREASE TO OUR PRODUCT COSTS IF POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL TARIFFS GO INTO EFFECT ON ALL CHINESE IMPORTS AND SPECIFICALLY APPAREL AND FOOTWEAR.

ENGINEERED FILMS' NET SALES WERE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER BY TEMPORARY OPERATIONAL INEFFICIENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE GO-LIVE ON A NEW ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (ERP) PLATFORM AND WEATHER RELATED IMPACTS WHICH FORCED PRODUCTION SHUTDOWNS AND DELAYED DELIVERY OF CERTAIN RAW MATERIALS. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THESE FACTORS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED ENGINEERED FILMS' NET SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTER BY APPROXIMATELY $4.5 MILLION.  #  21  THE COMPANY'S OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS $15.1 MILLION  , DOWN  $6.4 MILLION  , OR  29.8%  , COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NEGATIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE AS A RESULT OF LOWER SALES VOLUME. SALES VOLUME WAS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY IN ENGINEERED FILMS DUE TO PRIOR YEAR ABNORMALLY HIGH HURRICANE RECOVERY FILM SALES, THE POST GO-LIVE TEMPORARY OPERATIONAL INEFFICIENCIES, AND WEATHER RELATED IMPACTS TO PRODUCTION. INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES IN BOTH APPLIED TECHNOLOGY AND AEROSTAR ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING INCOME VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR.  NET INCOME FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS  $13.2 MILLION  , OR  $0.36  PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF  $22.1 MILLION  , OR  $0.61  PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. INCLUDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR'S FIRST QUARTER RESULTS ON A PRE-TAX BASIS WAS AN EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH A GIFT TO SOUTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY OF $4.5 MILLION ($3.7 MILLION AFTER-TAX, OR $0.10 PER DILUTED SHARE) AND A NON-OPERATING GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN SITE-SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGIES (SST) OF $5.8 MILLION ($4.7 MILLION AFTER-TAX, OR $0.13 PER DILUTED SHARE). THE NET IMPACT OF THESE TWO NON-RECURRING EVENTS TO THE PRIOR YEAR'S FIRST QUARTER WAS A FAVORABLE $0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE. IN ADDITION, THIS YEAR'S FIRST QUARTER NET INCOME BENEFITED FROM APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION ($0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN FAVORABLE DISCRETE TAX ITEMS WHICH REDUCED THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY APPROXIMATELY 6 PERCENTAGE POINTS YEAR-OVER-YEAR.  APPLIED TECHNOLOGY DIVISION RESULTS  APPLIED TECHNOLOGY'S NET SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE  $41.7 MILLION  , UP  $1.3 MILLION  FROM LAST YEAR'S FIRST QUARTER. GEOGRAPHICALLY, INTERNATIONAL SALES WERE UP 11.3% YEAR-OVER-YEAR, AND DOMESTIC SALES WERE FLAT YEAR-OVER-YEAR. INTERNATIONAL SALES GROWTH WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY STRONG GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA, PARTICULARLY BRAZIL.  OPERATING INCOME FOR APPLIED TECHNOLOGY WAS  $13.2 MILLION  , DOWN  $2.7 MILLION  OR  17.0%  COMPARED TO  $15.9 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. INCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT ALONG WITH INTEGRATION AND ACQUISITION EXPENSES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF AGSYNC, INC. (AGSYNC) DROVE THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE. IN ADDITION, FIRST QUARTER OPERATING INCOME IN THE PRIOR YEAR BENEFITED FROM FAVORABLE LEGAL RECOVERIES WHICH DID NOT REPEAT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR.  ENGINEERED FILMS DIVISION RESULTS  ENGINEERED FILMS\u2019 FISCAL 2020 FIRST QUARTER NET SALES WERE  $44.3 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  $15.7 MILLION  , OR  26.2%  , COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 FIRST QUARTER NET SALES OF  $60.0 MILLION  . INCLUDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR'S FIRST QUARTER NET SALES WAS $8.9 MILLION OF HURRICANE RECOVERY FILM SALES WHICH DID NOT REOCCUR IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER, THE DIVISION WENT LIVE ON ITS NEW ERP PLATFORM AND EXPERIENCED A TEMPORARY REDUCTION IN OPERATING EFFICIENCIES. THIS RESULTED IN DELAYS IN PROCESSING AND FULFILLING CERTAIN ORDERS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY $2.5 MILLION IN SALES WERE PUSHED INTO FUTURE QUARTERS AS A RESULT. ADDITIONALLY, POWER OUTAGES CAUSED BY AN ICE STORM RESULTED IN AN UNEXPECTED TWO-DAY PLANT SHUTDOWN IN THE FIRST QUARTER. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THIS SHUTDOWN REDUCED DIVISION SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020 BY APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION. TOGETHER, THESE TEMPORARY OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE DIVISION'S FIRST QUARTER NET SALES BY APPROXIMATELY $4.5 MILLION.  OPERATING INCOME FOR ENGINEERED FILMS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED  51.8%  TO  $6.4 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $13.2 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER SALES VOLUME, INCLUDING THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN HURRICANE RECOVERY FILM SALES, AND THE CORRESPONDING NEGATIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE. IN ADDITION, THE TEMPORARY OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES ALSO HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT TO DIVISION OPERATING INCOME.  AEROSTAR DIVISION RESULTS  AEROSTAR NET SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE  $12.2 MILLION  , AN INCREASE OF  $1.3 MILLION  , OR  11.8%  , COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 FIRST QUARTER NET SALES OF  $10.9 MILLION  . THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY IMPROVED STRATOSPHERIC BALLOON AND RADAR SALES. DELIVERIES ON THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED FIVE-YEAR $36 MILLION RADAR CONTRACT DROVE GROWTH IN RADAR SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTER.  OPERATING INCOME FOR AEROSTAR IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS  $2.0 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $2.8 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF LAST YEAR. THE DIVISION ACHIEVED YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN GROSS PROFIT ON HIGHER SALES VOLUME; HOWEVER, DIVISION PROFIT DECREASED DUE TO PURPOSEFUL INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES TO FURTHER ADVANCE ITS ENGINEERING SERVICES AND FLIGHT OPERATIONS CAPABILITIES.

THE FOLLOWING FACTORS WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE THREE-MONTH YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGES.  \u2022  MARKET CONDITIONS.  THE U.S. AG MARKET IS EXPERIENCING A VERY CHALLENGING START TO THE 2019 GROWING SEASON. WET, COOL WEATHER AND ABNORMAL FLOODING IN NORTH AMERICA HAVE DELAYED AND SHORTENED THE 2019 PLANTING SEASON. THIS HAS UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED APPLIED TECHNOLOGY, AS THE DIVISION'S CORE CUSTOMERS, AG RETAILERS, WERE LIMITED IN THE AMOUNT OF FIELD APPLICATION ACTIVITIES THAT COULD BE PERFORMED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. DUE TO THESE CHALLENGING FIELD CONDITIONS, SOME AG RETAILERS EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE DOUBLE-DIGIT DECLINES IN SALES DURING CALENDAR YEAR 2019, AND THIS WILL LIKELY IMPACT THE AMOUNT THEY INVEST IN NEW MACHINES OR TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES IN THE AFTERMARKET. WE EXPECT THIS TO IMPACT THE PLANNED NUMBER OF NEW MACHINE BUILDS FOR SOME OEMS THIS YEAR. WHILE UNFAVORABLE, THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE SHORT-TERM IN NATURE, AS THE LONG-TERM DEMAND FOR PRECISION AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGY IS EXPECTED TO GROW CONSIDERABLY.  \u2022  SALES VOLUME AND SELLING PRICES.  FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2020 NET SALES INCREASED  $1.3 MILLION  OR  3.2%  , TO  $41.7 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $40.4 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. HIGHER SALES VOLUME OF BOTH NEW AND EXISTING PRODUCTS, RATHER THAN A CHANGE IN SELLING PRICE, WAS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THIS INCREASE. GEOGRAPHICALLY, INTERNATIONAL SALES WERE UP 11.3% YEAR-OVER-YEAR, AND DOMESTIC SALES WERE FLAT YEAR-OVER-YEAR. INTERNATIONAL SALES GROWTH WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY STRONG GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA, PARTICULARLY BRAZIL. THE COMPANY DOES NOT GENERALLY MODEL COMPARATIVE MARKET SHARE POSITION FOR ITS DIVISIONS, BUT THE COMPANY BELIEVES APPLIED TECHNOLOGY HAS INCREASED ITS MARKET SHARE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  \u2022  INTERNATIONAL SALES.  FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, INTERNATIONAL SALES TOTALED  $12.1 MILLION  , UP  11.3%  FROM  $10.9 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. INTERNATIONAL SALES REPRESENTED  29.1%  OF SEGMENT REVENUE COMPARED TO  27.0%  OF SEGMENT REVENUE IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. STRONG GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA, PARTICULARLY BRAZIL, DROVE THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE. SALES TO THIS KEY AGRICULTURAL REGION ARE GROWING LARGELY DUE TO THE INVESTMENT IN AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DIVISION'S LATIN AMERICA HEADQUARTERS IN BRAZIL IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF LAST YEAR.  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN.  GROSS MARGIN DECREASED FROM  52.4%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER TO  51.1%  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN PROFITABILITY FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER MATERIAL RELATED EXPENSES.  \u2022  OPERATING EXPENSES.  FISCAL 2020 FIRST QUARTER OPERATING EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS  19.4%  , UP FROM  13.0%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT ALONG WITH INTEGRATION AND ACQUISITION EXPENSES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF AGSYNC.  ADDITIONALLY, PRIOR YEAR OPERATING EXPENSES BENEFITED FROM FAVORABLE LEGAL RECOVERIES WHICH DID NOT REPEAT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR.

THE FOLLOWING FACTORS WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE THREE-MONTH YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGES.  \u2022  MARKET CONDITIONS.  OIL PRICES HAVE REMAINED RELATIVELY STRONG SINCE THE START OF 2019, AND ALTHOUGH ENGINEERED FILMS IS MORE DIVERSIFIED AND LESS DEPENDENT ON THE ENERGY MARKET COMPARED TO RECENT YEARS, THE ENERGY MARKET STILL PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DIVISION'S OVERALL SUCCESS. ONE OF THE LEADING INDICATORS, OTHER THAN OIL PRICES, IS PERMIAN BASIN RIG COUNTS, WHICH WERE RELATIVELY FLAT YEAR-OVER-YEAR IN THE FIRST QUARTER. IF STRENGTH IN OIL PRICES IS SUSTAINED AND RIG COUNTS FOLLOW, THIS IS EXPECTED TO FAVORABLY IMPACT THE DIVISION'S GROWTH IN THE GEOMEMBRANE MARKET IN FISCAL 2020. THE COMPANY DOES NOT GENERALLY MODEL COMPARATIVE MARKET SHARE POSITION FOR ITS DIVISIONS, BUT THE COMPANY BELIEVES ENGINEERED FILMS HAS MAINTAINED ITS MARKET SHARE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  \u2022  SALES VOLUME AND SELLING PRICES  . FIRST QUARTER NET SALES WERE  $44.3 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  $15.7 MILLION  , OR  26.2%  , COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 FIRST QUARTER NET SALES OF  $60.0 MILLION  . A LARGER DECREASE IN SALES VOLUME, MEASURED IN POUNDS SOLD, RATHER THAN THE CHANGE IN SELLING PRICE WAS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THIS YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE. INCLUDED IN PRIOR YEAR'S FIRST QUARTER NET SALES WAS $8.9 MILLION OF HURRICANE RECOVERY FILM SALES WHICH DID NOT REOCCUR IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THE DIVISION ALSO WENT LIVE ON ITS NEW ERP PLATFORM AND EXPERIENCED TEMPORARY OPERATING INEFFICIENCIES. THIS RESULTED IN DELAYS IN PROCESSING AND FULFILLING CERTAIN ORDERS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY $2.5 MILLION IN SALES WERE PUSHED INTO FUTURE QUARTERS AS A RESULT. ADDITIONALLY, POWER OUTAGES CAUSED BY AN ICE STORM RESULTED IN AN UNEXPECTED TWO-DAY PLANT SHUTDOWN IN THE FIRST QUARTER. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THIS SHUTDOWN REDUCED DIVISION SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020 BY APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION. TOGETHER, THESE TEMPORARY OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED FIRST QUARTER NET SALES BY APPROXIMATELY $4.5 MILLION.  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN.  FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, GROSS MARGIN WAS  20.0%  . GROSS MARGIN FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2018, WAS  25.3%  . THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER SALES VOLUME, INCLUDING THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN HURRICANE RECOVERY FILM SALES, AND THE CORRESPONDING NEGATIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE. IN ADDITION, THE TEMPORARY OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT TO DIVISION GROSS MARGIN.  \u2022  OPERATING EXPENSES.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, OPERATING EXPENSES WERE  5.6%  IN THE CURRENT YEAR THREE-MONTH PERIOD AS COMPARED TO  3.3%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE WAS LED BY HIGHER LEGAL EXPENSES AND A DECREASE IN SALES VOLUME.  AEROSTAR  AEROSTAR SERVES THE AEROSPACE/DEFENSE AND COMMERCIAL LIGHTER-THAN-AIR MARKETS.

THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY IMPROVED STRATOSPHERIC BALLOON AND RADAR SALES. DELIVERIES ON THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED FIVE-YEAR $36 MILLION RADAR CONTRACT DROVE GROWTH IN RADAR SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTER.  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN.  FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD, GROSS MARGIN INCREASED FROM  33.4%  TO  40.0%  . THE INCREASE IN PROFITABILITY FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED LEVERAGE ON HIGHER SALES VOLUME.  \u2022  OPERATING EXPENSES.  FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2020 OPERATING EXPENSE WAS  $2.9 MILLION  , OR  23.7%  OF NET SALES, AN INCREASE FROM  7.7%  OF NET SALES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF ACTIVITY RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS OR LOSSES. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR 2020. FISCAL 2019 FIRST QUARTER OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET INCLUDED A $5.8 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE COMPANY'S EQUITY INTEREST IN SST.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED  APRIL 30,  2019 AND 2018, WERE  12.2%  AND  18.6%  , RESPECTIVELY. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY FAVORABLE DISCRETE TAX ITEMS RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT AND VESTING OF EQUITY COMPENSATION AWARDS. REFER TO NOTE 13  INCOME TAXES  OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THESE IMPACTS TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  #  25  OUTLOOK  TEMPORARY CONDITIONS IMPACTING APPLIED TECHNOLOGY AND SHORT-TERM OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES IN ENGINEERED FILMS HELD DOWN FIRST QUARTER RESULTS. WHILE UNFORTUNATE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THE FIRST QUARTER PERFORMANCE WILL BE INDICATIVE OF THE PERFORMANCE FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR. TO THE CONTRARY, AT THIS TIME THE COMPANY EXPECTS GROWTH IN BOTH SALES AND OPERATING INCOME IN EACH DIVISION THIS FISCAL YEAR.  APPLIED TECHNOLOGY\u2019S SLOWER START TO FISCAL 2020 WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO EXTREMELY CHALLENGING SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS AND THE CORRESPONDING IMPACTS THIS HAD ON AG RETAILERS. WITH THAT SAID, THE DIVISION WAS ABLE TO ENDURE THESE CHALLENGES AND STILL ACHIEVE MODEST REVENUE GROWTH THROUGH LEVERAGING ITS PRIOR YEAR INVESTMENT IN LATIN AMERICA AND BY CONTINUING TO INTRODUCE NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO THE MARKETPLACE. CORE FUNDAMENTALS REMAIN STRONG FOR APPLIED TECHNOLOGY, AND THE DIVISION CONTINUES TO APPROPRIATELY FOCUS ON INNOVATION AND INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION TO DRIVE MARKET SHARE GAINS REGARDLESS OF END-MARKET CONDITIONS THEY MAY FACE.  ENGINEERED FILMS FACED SOME UNFORTUNATE SHORT-TERM OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER, BUT THESE ARE TEMPORARY SITUATIONS. THE SHORT-TERM IMPACT TO OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AS A RESULT OF GOING LIVE ON A NEW ERP PLATFORM WAS EXPECTED. OVERALL, THIS IMPLEMENTATION HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL AND THE DIVISION FULLY EXPECTS TO RETURN TO PRE-GO-LIVE EFFICIENCY SOON AND ACHIEVE EVEN STRONGER EFFICIENCIES OVER TIME. THE DIVISION EXPECTS THE ENERGY MARKET TO REMAIN STRONG THIS YEAR, SALES FROM LINE 15 TO INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, AND FOR GEOMEMBRANE INSTALLATION REVENUES TO REMAIN STRONG.  AEROSTAR IS CAPITALIZING ON THEIR MARKET-LEADING TECHNOLOGY AND CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONDING WITH POSITIVE FEEDBACK REGARDING THE DIVISION\u2019S SERVICE AND EXECUTION. THE DIVISION IS INVESTING HEAVILY IN NEW PRODUCT INNOVATIONS AND ADVANCING ITS FLIGHT OPERATION CAPABILITIES, AND THE COMPANY IS VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE DIVISION'S FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS. THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN PURPOSEFUL AND ARE INDICATIVE OF THE FUTURE GROWTH POTENTIAL WITHIN ITS CORE STRATOSPHERIC BALLOON AND RADAR PRODUCT PLATFORMS. THE OVERALL PROFITABILITY OF THE DIVISION REMAINS HEALTHY DESPITE INCREASED INVESTMENT, AND THE COMPANY IS VERY PLEASED WITH THE STRATEGIC DIRECTION OF THIS DIVISION.  OVERALL, THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM STRATEGY REMAINS SOUND AND ITS STRONG POSITION IN ATTRACTIVE MARKETS, COMBINED WITH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS, GEOGRAPHIC MARKET EXPANSION, AND ACQUISITIONS, PROVIDE CONFIDENCE IN THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PERFORM WELL FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. THE UNDERLYING BUSINESSES ARE EXPECTED TO GROW WITH STRONG MARGINS, WHILE MAKING KEY INVESTMENTS TO ENABLE FUTURE GROWTH. IN ORDER TO MEET THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVE OF 10 PERCENT ANNUAL EARNINGS GROWTH OVER THE LONG TERM, MORE AGGRESSIVE INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT THE THREE DIVISIONS WILL LIKELY BE NEEDED. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY EVALUATING THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIS INCREASED RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN A WAY THAT BUILDS ON THE SUCCESS ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019, DELIVERS STRONG RESULTS IN FISCAL 2020 AND POSITIONS THE COMPANY WELL FOR THE LONG TERM.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY'S BALANCE SHEET CONTINUES TO REFLECT SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY AND A STRONG CAPITAL BASE. MANAGEMENT FOCUSES ON THE CURRENT CASH BALANCE AND OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN CONSIDERING LIQUIDITY, AS OPERATING CASH FLOWS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THAT CURRENT CASH, COMBINED WITH THE GENERATION OF POSITIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMPANY'S NORMAL OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES BEYOND THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS A CREDIT FACILITY OF UP TO $125.0 MILLION WITH A MATURITY DATE OF APRIL 15, 2020.  THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH BALANCES AND CASH FLOWS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

THE COMPARABLE BALANCE AS OF APRIL 30, 2018 WAS $51.3 MILLION  . THE SEQUENTIAL DECREASE IN CASH WAS LED BY AN INCREASE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OPERATING CASH FLOW RESULTS WERE PRIMARILY FROM CASH RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS, WHICH WERE OFFSET BY CASH PAYMENTS FOR INVENTORIES, SERVICES, EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, AND INCOME TAXES. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $8.8 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED WITH  $13.6 MILLION  IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS YEAR-OVER-YEAR WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER NET INCOME AND AN INCREASE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  THE COMPANY'S CASH NEEDS HAVE MINIMAL SEASONAL TRENDS. AS A RESULT, THE DISCUSSION OF TRENDS IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOCUSES ON THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF YEAR-OVER-YEAR VARIABILITY IN NET WORKING CAPITAL. NET WORKING CAPITAL AND NET WORKING CAPITAL PERCENTAGE ARE METRICS USED BY MANAGEMENT AS A GUIDE IN MEASURING THE EFFICIENT USE OF CASH RESOURCES TO SUPPORT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND GROWTH. THE COMPANY'S NET WORKING CAPITAL FOR THE COMPARATIVE PERIODS WAS AS FOLLOWS.

(B)  ANNUALIZED NET SALES IS DEFINED AS THE MOST RECENT QUARTER NET SALES TIMES FOUR FOR EACH OF THE FISCAL PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY.  (C)  NET WORKING CAPITAL PERCENTAGE IS DEFINED AS NET WORKING CAPITAL DIVIDED BY ANNUALIZED NET SALES.  NET WORKING CAPITAL PERCENTAGE DETERIORATED  380  BASIS POINTS YEAR-OVER-YEAR IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THIS YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WITHIN THE APPLIED TECHNOLOGY DIVISION.  INVENTORY LEVELS INCREASED $2.8 MILLION, OR  5.2%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR FROM  $55.2 MILLION  AT APRIL 30, 2018, TO  $58.0 MILLION  AT APRIL 30, 2019. IN COMPARISON, CONSOLIDATED NET SALES DECREASED  $13.0 MILLION  , OR  11.7%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR IN THE  FIRST QUARTER  . APPLIED TECHNOLOGY'S INVENTORY INCREASED YEAR-OVER-YEAR AS THE DIVISION BUILT UP INVENTORY TO SUPPORT ITS INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION AND IN PREPARATION FOR THE SPRING SEASON IN NORTH AMERICA. HOWEVER, FIRST QUARTER SALES IN NORTH AMERICA WERE LESS THAN EXPECTED DUE TO THE VERY CHALLENGING START TO THE 2019 PLANTING SEASON.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASED  $1.0 MILLION  , OR  1.5%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR TO  $67.8 MILLION  AT  APRIL 30, 2019  , FROM  $66.8 MILLION  AT  APRIL 30, 2018  . IN COMPARISON, CONSOLIDATED NET SALES DECREASED  $13.0 MILLION  , OR  11.7%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR IN THE  FIRST QUARTER  . TIMING OF INVOICING AND CASH RECEIPTS WITHIN APPLIED TECHNOLOGY WAS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE INCREASED  $1.5 MILLION  , OR  10.0%  , YEAR-OVER-YEAR FROM  $14.7 MILLION  AT  APRIL 30, 2018  , TO  $16.2 MILLION  AT  APRIL 30, 2019  . THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO TIMING OF PURCHASES AND CASH PAYMENTS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $2.4 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED WITH CASH PROVIDED OF  $3.2 MILLION  IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE WAS $6.6 MILLION IN CASH RECEIPTS  #  27  IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO THE SALE OF THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN SST.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 WAS UP  $4.9 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE INCREASE IN CASH OUTFLOWS INCLUDED  $2.3 MILLION  OF SHARE REPURCHASES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THERE WERE NO SHARE REPURCHASES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  DIVIDENDS PER SHARE WAS 13.0 CENTS PER SHARE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020. TOTAL CASH OUTFLOWS FOR DIVIDENDS IN THE THREE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AND 2018, WERE EACH $4.7 MILLION.  NO BORROWING OR REPAYMENT OCCURRED ON THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 OR FISCAL 2019.  OTHER LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT DATED APRIL 15, 2015. THIS AGREEMENT (CREDIT AGREEMENT), MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 10  FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS  OF THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q, PROVIDES FOR A SYNDICATED SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY UP TO $125 MILLION WITH A MATURITY DATE OF  APRIL 15, 2020  . THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FOR ANY OF THE FISCAL PERIODS COVERED BY THIS FORM 10-Q.
