CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY\u2019S SUCCESS PRINCIPALLY DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE FREIGHT REVENUE THROUGH ITS NETWORK OF  INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS AND TO SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY DELIVER FREIGHT UTILIZING THIRD PARTY CAPACITY PROVIDERS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS TO THE COMPANY\u2019S SUCCESS INCLUDE INCREASING REVENUE, SOURCING CAPACITY  AND CONTROLLING COSTS, INCLUDING INSURANCE AND CLAIMS.  WHILE CUSTOMER DEMAND, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ULTIMATELY  DRIVES INCREASES OR DECREASES IN REVENUE, THE COMPANY PRIMARILY RELIES ON ITS INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS TO ESTABLISH CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND GENERATE REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES. MANAGEMENT\u2019S EMPHASIS WITH RESPECT TO REVENUE GROWTH IS ON  REVENUE GENERATED BY INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS WHO ON AN ANNUAL BASIS GENERATE $1 MILLION OR MORE OF LANDSTAR REVENUE (\u201cMILLION DOLLAR AGENTS\u201d). MANAGEMENT BELIEVES FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH IS PRIMARILY DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY  TO INCREASE BOTH THE REVENUE GENERATED BY MILLION DOLLAR AGENTS AND THE NUMBER OF MILLION DOLLAR AGENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF RECRUITING NEW AGENTS, INCREASING THE REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES GENERATED BY EXISTING INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS  AND PROVIDING ITS INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS WITH TECHNOLOGY-BASED TOOLS THEY MAY USE TO GROW REVENUE AND INCREASE EFFICIENCIES AT THEIR BUSINESSES. DURING THE 2018 FISCAL YEAR, 608 INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS GENERATED  $1 MILLION OR MORE OF LANDSTAR REVENUE AND THUS QUALIFIED AS MILLION DOLLAR AGENTS. DURING THE 2018 FISCAL YEAR, THE AVERAGE REVENUE GENERATED BY A MILLION DOLLAR AGENT WAS $7,150,000 AND REVENUE GENERATED BY MILLION DOLLAR AGENTS IN THE  AGGREGATE REPRESENTED 94% OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUE.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT MONITORS BUSINESS ACTIVITY BY TRACKING THE NUMBER OF LOADS (VOLUME) AND REVENUE  PER LOAD BY MODE OF TRANSPORTATION. REVENUE PER LOAD CAN BE INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS OTHER THAN A CHANGE IN PRICE. THOSE FACTORS INCLUDE THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF HAUL, FREIGHT TYPE, SPECIAL HANDLING AND EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS, FUEL COSTS AND DELIVERY  TIME REQUIREMENTS. FOR SHIPMENTS INVOLVING TWO OR MORE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION, REVENUE IS GENERALLY CLASSIFIED BY THE MODE OF TRANSPORTATION HAVING THE HIGHEST COST FOR THE LOAD.

PURCHASED  TRANSPORTATION PAID TO A TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIER IS BASED ON EITHER A NEGOTIATED RATE FOR EACH LOAD HAULED OR, TO A LESSER EXTENT, A CONTRACTUALLY AGREED-UPON FIXED RATE PER LOAD. PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION PAID TO RAILROADS IS BASED ON EITHER A  NEGOTIATED RATE FOR EACH LOAD HAULED OR A CONTRACTUALLY AGREED-UPON FIXED RATE PER LOAD. PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION PAID TO AIR CARGO CARRIERS IS GENERALLY BASED ON A NEGOTIATED RATE FOR EACH LOAD HAULED AND PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION PAID TO OCEAN  CARGO CARRIERS IS GENERALLY BASED ON CONTRACTUALLY AGREED-UPON FIXED RATES. PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE FOR TRUCK BROKERAGE, RAIL INTERMODAL AND OCEAN CARGO SERVICES IS NORMALLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR  AND AIR CARGO SERVICES. PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION IS THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF COSTS AND EXPENSES AND, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, INCREASES OR DECREASES AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUE IN PROPORTION TO CHANGES IN THE PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED  REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTY CAPACITY PROVIDERS AND EXTERNAL REVENUE FROM THE INSURANCE SEGMENT, CONSISTING OF REINSURANCE PREMIUMS. PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION AS A PERCENT OF REVENUE ALSO INCREASES OR  DECREASES IN RELATION TO THE AVAILABILITY OF TRUCK BROKERAGE CAPACITY AND WITH CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF FUEL ON REVENUE GENERATED BY TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS. THE COMPANY PASSES 100% OF FUEL SURCHARGES BILLED TO CUSTOMERS FOR FREIGHT HAULED BY BCO  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO ITS BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THESE FUEL SURCHARGES ARE EXCLUDED FROM REVENUE AND THE COST OF PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION. PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE TRANSIT PERIOD AS THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION  TO THE CUSTOMER IS COMPLETED.  COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUALLY AGREED-UPON PERCENTAGES OF REVENUE OR NET REVENUE, DEFINED  AS REVENUE LESS THE COST OF PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION, OR NET REVENUE LESS A CONTRACTUALLY AGREED UPON PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE RETAINED BY LANDSTAR. COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUE WILL VARY DIRECTLY WITH FLUCTUATIONS IN  THE PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GENERATED BY THE VARIOUS MODES OF TRANSPORTATION AND REINSURANCE PREMIUMS AND WITH CHANGES IN NET REVENUE MARGIN, DEFINED AS NET REVENUE DIVIDED BY REVENUE, ON SERVICES PROVIDED BY TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS,  RAILROADS, AIR CARGO CARRIERS AND OCEAN CARGO CARRIERS. COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE FREIGHT TRANSIT PERIOD AS THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION TO THE CUSTOMER IS COMPLETED.  THE COMPANY DEFINES GROSS PROFIT AS REVENUE LESS THE COST OF PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION AND COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS. GROSS PROFIT DIVIDED BY  REVENUE IS REFERRED TO AS GROSS PROFIT MARGIN. THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING MARGIN IS DEFINED AS OPERATING INCOME DIVIDED BY GROSS PROFIT.  IN GENERAL, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN ON REVENUE GENERATED BY BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS REPRESENTS A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE DUE TO THE NATURE  OF THE CONTRACTS THAT PAY A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE TO BOTH THE BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS. FOR REVENUE GENERATED BY TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN IS EITHER FIXED OR VARIABLE AS A PERCENT  OF REVENUE, DEPENDING ON THE CONTRACT WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENT. UNDER CERTAIN CONTRACTS WITH INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS, THE COMPANY RETAINS A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE AND THE AGENT RETAINS THE AMOUNT  REMAINING LESS THE COST OF PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION (THE \u201cRETENTION CONTRACTS\u201d). GROSS PROFIT MARGIN ON REVENUE GENERATED BY RAILROADS, AIR CARGO CARRIERS, OCEAN CARGO CARRIERS AND TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS, OTHER THAN THOSE UNDER RETENTION  CONTRACTS, IS VARIABLE IN NATURE AS THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTRACTS WITH INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS PROVIDE COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS AT A CONTRACTUALLY AGREED UPON PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE FOR THESE TYPES OF LOADS. APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE  COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED REVENUE IN THE THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MARCH 30, 2019 WAS GENERATED UNDER CONTRACTS THAT HAVE A FIXED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN WHILE 50% WAS UNDER CONTRACTS THAT HAVE A VARIABLE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MAINTENANCE COSTS FOR COMPANY-PROVIDED TRAILING EQUIPMENT AND BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR  RECRUITING AND QUALIFICATION COSTS ARE THE LARGEST COMPONENTS OF OTHER OPERATING COSTS. ALSO INCLUDED IN OTHER OPERATING COSTS ARE TRAILER RENTAL COSTS, THE PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ADVANCES AND OTHER RECEIVABLES DUE FROM BCO INDEPENDENT  CONTRACTORS AND INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS AND GAINS/LOSSES, IF ANY, ON SALES OF COMPANY-OWNED TRAILING EQUIPMENT.  WITH RESPECT  TO INSURANCE AND CLAIMS COST, POTENTIAL LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH ACCIDENTS IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY IS SEVERE AND OCCURRENCES ARE UNPREDICTABLE. FOR COMMERCIAL TRUCKING CLAIMS, LANDSTAR RETAINS LIABILITY UP TO $5,000,000 PER OCCURRENCE. IN  ADDITION, FOR COMMERCIAL TRUCKING CLAIMS EXCEEDING ITS $5,000,000 PER OCCURRENCE SELF-INSURED RETENTION, THE COMPANY RETAINS LIABILITY UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $700,000 IN THE AGGREGATE ON ANY CLAIMS INCURRED ON OR AFTER MAY 1, 2016 THROUGH  APRIL 30, 2017, UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $500,000 IN THE AGGREGATE ON ANY CLAIMS INCURRED ON OR AFTER MAY 1, 2017 THROUGH APRIL 30, 2018 AND UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $350,000 IN THE AGGREGATE ON ANY CLAIMS INCURRED ON OR AFTER MAY 1, 2018  THROUGH APRIL 30, 2019. THE COMPANY ALSO RETAINS LIABILITY OF UP TO $1,000,000 FOR EACH GENERAL LIABILITY CLAIM, UP TO $250,000 FOR EACH WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION CLAIM AND UP TO $250,000 FOR EACH CARGO CLAIM. IN ADDITION, UNDER REINSURANCE  ARRANGEMENTS BY SIGNATURE OF CERTAIN RISKS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, THE COMPANY RETAINS LIABILITY OF UP TO $500,000, $1,000,000 OR $2,000,000 WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENT CLAIMS AND UP TO $750,000 WITH  RESPECT TO CERTAIN WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION CLAIMS. THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPOSURE TO LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH ACCIDENTS INCURRED BY TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS, RAILROADS AND AIR AND OCEAN CARGO CARRIERS WHO TRANSPORT FREIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY  IS REDUCED BY VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH CARRIERS MAINTAIN THEIR OWN INSURANCE COVERAGE. A MATERIAL INCREASE IN THE FREQUENCY OR SEVERITY OF ACCIDENTS, CARGO CLAIMS OR WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION CLAIMS OR THE MATERIAL  UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT OF EXISTING CLAIMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON LANDSTAR\u2019S COST OF INSURANCE AND CLAIMS AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  DURING THE THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MARCH 30, 2019, EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY SIXTY-SEVEN PERCENT  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION PRIMARILY RELATE TO DEPRECIATION OF  TRAILING EQUIPMENT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE PERCENTAGE RELATIONSHIP OF  PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION AND COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS, BOTH BEING DIRECT COSTS, TO REVENUE AND INDIRECT COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS PROFIT FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 30,  2019  MARCH 31,  2018  REVENUE  100.0%  100.0%  PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION  76.6  77.3  COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS  8.3  7.8  GROSS PROFIT MARGIN  15.1%  14.8%  GROSS PROFIT  100.0%  100.0%  INVESTMENT INCOME  0.7  0.6  INDIRECT COSTS AND EXPENSES.  OTHER OPERATING COSTS, NET OF GAINS ON ASSET SALES/DISPOSITIONS  5.3  4.9  INSURANCE AND CLAIMS  9.6  11.2  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  26.5  29.1  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  7.3  7.1  TOTAL COSTS AND EXPENSES  48.7  52.2  OPERATING MARGIN  52.0%  48.3%  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A DISCUSSION OF INDIRECT COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS PROFIT IS  USEFUL AND MEANINGFUL TO POTENTIAL INVESTORS FOR THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPAL REASONS: (1) DISCLOSURE OF THESE RELATIVE MEASURES (I.E., EACH INDIRECT OPERATING COST LINE ITEM AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS PROFIT) ALLOWS INVESTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE  UNDERLYING TRENDS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS; (2) DUE TO THE GENERALLY FIXED NATURE OF THESE INDIRECT COSTS (OTHER THAN INSURANCE AND CLAIMS COSTS), THESE RELATIVE MEASURES ARE MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS\u2019 EVALUATIONS OF THE  COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT OF ITS INDIRECT COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OPERATIONS; (3) MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THIS FINANCIAL INFORMATION IN ITS DECISION-MAKING, SUCH AS BUDGETING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE, TRAILING EQUIPMENT AND SELLING, GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS; AND (4) THIS INFORMATION FACILITATES COMPARISONS BY INVESTORS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS TO THE RESULTS OF OTHER  NON-ASSET  OR ASSET-LIGHT COMPANIES IN THE TRANSPORTATION AND  LOGISTICS SERVICES INDUSTRY WHO REPORT \u201cNET REVENUE\u201d IN MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, WHICH REPRESENTS REVENUE LESS THE COST OF PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMPANY\u2019S USE OF THE TERM \u201cGROSS  PROFIT\u201d AND USE OF THE TERM \u201cNET REVENUE\u201d BY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS SERVICES INDUSTRY IS DUE TO THE DIRECT COST OF COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS UNDER THE LANDSTAR BUSINESS MODEL, WHEREAS OTHER COMPANIES IN THIS  INDUSTRY GENERALLY HAVE NO COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS.  ALSO, AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, THE COMPANY REPORTS TWO OPERATING SEGMENTS: THE  TRANSPORTATION LOGISTICS SEGMENT AND THE INSURANCE SEGMENT. EXTERNAL REVENUE AT THE INSURANCE SEGMENT, REPRESENTING REINSURANCE PREMIUMS, HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN RELATIVELY CONSISTENT AT 2% OR LESS OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUE AND GENERALLY CORRESPONDS  DIRECTLY WITH THE NUMBER OF TRUCKS PROVIDED BY BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THE DISCUSSION OF INDIRECT COST LINE ITEMS IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSIDERS THE COMPANY\u2019S COSTS  ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS RATHER THAN ON A SEGMENT BASIS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS PRESENTATION FORMAT IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE TO ASSIST USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN UNDERSTANDING THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.  (1) THE INSURANCE SEGMENT HAS NO OTHER OPERATING COSTS; (2) DISCUSSION OF INSURANCE AND CLAIMS AT EITHER SEGMENT WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE OTHER MAY CREATE CONFUSION AMONGST INVESTORS AND POTENTIAL INVESTORS DUE TO INTERCOMPANY ARRANGEMENTS  AND SPECIFIC DEDUCTIBLE PROGRAMS THAT AFFECT COMPARABILITY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS BY SEGMENT BETWEEN VARIOUS FISCAL PERIODS BUT THAT HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE COMPANY FROM A CONSOLIDATED REPORTING PERSPECTIVE; (3) SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  COSTS OF THE INSURANCE SEGMENT COMPRISE LESS THAN 10% OF CONSOLIDATED SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN RELATIVELY CONSISTENT ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS; AND (4) THE INSURANCE SEGMENT HAS NO DEPRECIATION AND  AMORTIZATION.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  REVENUE FOR THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD WAS $1,033,000,000, A DECREASE OF $14,926,000, OR 1%, COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD.  TRANSPORTATION REVENUE DECREASED $16,679,000, OR 2%. THE DECREASE IN TRANSPORTATION REVENUE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASED REVENUE PER LOAD OF APPROXIMATELY 4%, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASED NUMBER OF LOADS HAULED OF APPROXIMATELY 2%. REINSURANCE  PREMIUMS WERE $14,039,000 AND $12,286,000 FOR THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM REINSURANCE PREMIUMS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF TRUCKS PROVIDED BY BCO  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD.  TRUCK TRANSPORTATION REVENUE  GENERATED BY BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS (TOGETHER, THE \u201cTHIRD PARTY TRUCK CAPACITY PROVIDERS\u201d) FOR THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD WAS $953,111,000, REPRESENTING 92% OF TOTAL REVENUE, A DECREASE OF $25,977,000,  OR 3%, COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD. REVENUE PER LOAD ON LOADS HAULED BY THIRD PARTY TRUCK CAPACITY PROVIDERS DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 5% IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD, WHILE THE NUMBER OF  LOADS HAULED BY THIRD PARTY TRUCK CAPACITY PROVIDERS INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 2% COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD. THE DECREASE IN REVENUE PER LOAD ON LOADS HAULED VIA TRUCK WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A SOFTER FREIGHT ENVIRONMENT EXPERIENCED  DURING THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD, WHICH RESULTED IN MORE READILY AVAILABLE TRUCK CAPACITY AS COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD. REVENUE PER LOAD ON LOADS HAULED VIA VAN EQUIPMENT DECREASED 7%, REVENUE PER LOAD ON LOADS HAULED VIA  UNSIDED/PLATFORM EQUIPMENT DECREASED 1% AND REVENUE PER LOAD ON LESS-THAN-TRUCKLOAD LOADINGS DECREASED 6% AS COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LOADS HAULED VIA TRUCK COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD  WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S UNSIDED/PLATFORM SERVICES AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER DEMAND FOR TRUCKLOAD SERVICES PROVIDED VIA VAN EQUIPMENT. THE NUMBER OF LOADS HAULED VIA UNSIDED/PLATFORM AND VAN EQUIPMENT INCREASED 4% AND 1%  DURING THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD. FUEL SURCHARGES BILLED TO CUSTOMERS ON REVENUE GENERATED BY BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE EXCLUDED FROM REVENUE. FUEL SURCHARGES ON TRUCK BROKERAGE  CARRIER REVENUE IDENTIFIED SEPARATELY IN BILLINGS TO CUSTOMERS AND INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIER REVENUE WERE $20,987,000 AND $22,245,000 IN THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT BILLINGS  TO MANY CUSTOMERS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TRUCK BROKERAGE SERVICES INCLUDE A SINGLE  ALL-IN  RATE THAT DOES NOT SEPARATELY IDENTIFY FUEL SURCHARGES ON LOADS HAULED VIA TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE  OVERALL IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FUEL PRICES ON REVENUE AND REVENUE PER LOAD ON LOADS HAULED VIA TRUCK IS LIKELY TO BE GREATER THAN THAT INDICATED.  TRANSPORTATION REVENUE GENERATED BY RAIL INTERMODAL, AIR CARGO AND OCEAN CARGO CARRIERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cMULTIMODE CAPACITY  PROVIDERS\u201d) FOR THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD WAS $60,684,000, OR 6% OF TOTAL REVENUE, AN INCREASE OF $7,915,000, OR 15%, COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD. REVENUE PER LOAD ON REVENUE GENERATED BY MULTIMODE CAPACITY PROVIDERS INCREASED  APPROXIMATELY 13% IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD, AND THE NUMBER OF LOADS HAULED BY MULTIMODE CAPACITY  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PROVIDERS INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 2% OVER THE SAME PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE PER LOAD OF 13% ON LOADS HAULED BY MULTIMODE CAPACITY PROVIDERS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED REVENUE  PER LOAD ON OCEAN LOADS. THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LOADS HAULED BY MULTIMODE CAPACITY PROVIDERS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A 34% INCREASE IN AIR LOADINGS, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED AIR LOADINGS FOR ONE SPECIFIC CUSTOMER. ALSO, REVENUE PER  LOAD ON REVENUE GENERATED BY MULTIMODE CAPACITY PROVIDERS IS INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING REVENUE MIX AMONG THE VARIOUS MODES OF TRANSPORTATION USED, LENGTH OF HAUL, COMPLEXITY OF FREIGHT, DENSITY OF FREIGHT LANES, FUEL COSTS AND  AVAILABILITY OF CAPACITY.  PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION WAS 76.6% AND 77.3% OF REVENUE IN THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS,  RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASED RATE OF PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION PAID ON TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIER REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE  CONTRIBUTED BY BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, WHICH TYPICALLY HAS A LOWER RATE OF PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION THAN REVENUE GENERATED BY TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS. COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS WERE 8.3% AND 7.8% OF REVENUE IN THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK  PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASED NET REVENUE MARGIN ON REVENUE GENERATED BY TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS.  INVESTMENT INCOME WAS $1,138,000 AND $861,000 IN THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME WAS  ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER AVERAGE RATES OF RETURN ON INVESTMENTS IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD.  OTHER OPERATING COSTS INCREASED $635,000  IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD AND REPRESENTED 5.3% OF GROSS PROFIT IN THE 2019 PERIOD COMPARED TO 4.9% OF GROSS PROFIT IN THE 2018 PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN OTHER OPERATING COSTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED TRAILING EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE COSTS AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASED NUMBER OF COMPANY-OWNED TRAILERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASED PROVISION FOR CONTRACTOR BAD DEBT. THE INCREASE IN OTHER OPERATING COSTS AS A  PERCENTAGE OF GROSS PROFIT WAS CAUSED BY THE INCREASE IN OTHER OPERATING COSTS.  INSURANCE AND CLAIMS DECREASED $2,367,000 IN THE 2019  THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD AND REPRESENTED 9.6% OF GROSS PROFIT IN THE 2019 PERIOD COMPARED TO 11.2% OF GROSS PROFIT IN THE 2018 PERIOD. THE DECREASE IN INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR WAS  PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED NET UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT OF PRIOR YEARS\u2019 CLAIMS AND DECREASED SEVERITY OF CURRENT YEAR CLAIMS IN THE 2019 PERIOD. NET UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT OF PRIOR YEARS\u2019 CLAIMS WAS $1,407,000 AND $2,558,000 IN THE 2019  AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN INSURANCE AND CLAIMS AS A PERCENT OF GROSS PROFIT WAS CAUSED BY THE DECREASE IN INSURANCE AND CLAIMS COSTS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS DECREASED $3,983,000 IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD AND  REPRESENTED 26.5% OF GROSS PROFIT IN THE 2019 PERIOD COMPARED TO 29.1% OF GROSS PROFIT IN THE 2018 PERIOD. THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASED PROVISION FOR INCENTIVE  COMPENSATION AND DECREASED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED WAGES AND AN INCREASED PROVISION FOR CUSTOMER BAD DEBT. INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $1,038,000  AND $4,131,000 FOR THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $1,938,000 AND $3,710,000 FOR THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS A PERCENT OF GROSS PROFIT WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED $319,000 IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD AND REPRESENTED  7.3% OF GROSS PROFIT IN THE 2019 PERIOD COMPARED TO 7.1% OF GROSS PROFIT IN THE 2018 PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASED NUMBER OF COMPANY-OWNED TRAILERS. THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND  AMORTIZATION AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS PROFIT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASED DEPRECIATION COSTS.  INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE IN THE 2019  THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD INCREASED $5,000 COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD.  THE PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE 2019 AND 2018  THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS WERE BASED ON ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES OF 24.2% AND 24.5%, RESPECTIVELY, ADJUSTED FOR DISCRETE EVENTS, SUCH AS BENEFITS RESULTING FROM STOCK-BASED AWARDS. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE 2019  THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD WAS 21.0%, WHICH APPROXIMATED THE STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD WAS 22.7%, WHICH WAS HIGHER THAN THE STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY  ATTRIBUTABLE TO STATE TAXES, THE TAX REFORM ACT\u2019S ELIMINATION OF THE PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION EXCEPTION UNDER SECTION 162(M) AND THE MEALS AND ENTERTAINMENT EXCLUSION. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD OF  21.0% WAS LOWER THAN THE 24.2% ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED ON STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD, WHICH ESSENTIALLY OFFSET THE IMPACT OF STATE TAXES  AND THE MEALS AND ENTERTAINMENT EXCLUSION. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD OF 22.7% WAS LOWER THAN THE 24.5% ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED ON STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS IN THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST OF $17,000 AND $44,000 IN THE 2019 AND  2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTS THE FORMER NONCONTROLLING INVESTORS\u2019 SHARE OF THE NET LOSS INCURRED BY LANDSTAR METRO AND LANDSTAR SERVICIOS.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY WAS $63,317,000, OR $1.58 PER COMMON SHARE ($1.58 PER DILUTED SHARE), IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY WAS $57,517,000, OR $1.37 PER COMMON SHARE ($1.37 PER DILUTED SHARE), IN THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD.  CAPITAL  RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  WORKING CAPITAL AND THE RATIO OF CURRENT ASSETS TO CURRENT LIABILITIES WERE $470,951,000 AND 2.0 TO 1,  RESPECTIVELY, AT MARCH 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH $435,611,000 AND 1.8 TO 1, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 29, 2018. LANDSTAR HAS HISTORICALLY OPERATED WITH CURRENT RATIOS WITHIN THE RANGE OF 1.5 TO 1 TO 2.0 TO 1. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING  ACTIVITIES WAS $121,416,000 IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD COMPARED WITH $72,002,000 IN THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TIMING OF COLLECTIONS OF TRADE  RECEIVABLES.  THE COMPANY DECLARED AND PAID $0.165 PER SHARE, OR $6,629,000 IN THE AGGREGATE, IN CASH DIVIDENDS DURING THE THIRTEEN-WEEK  PERIOD ENDED MARCH 30, 2019. THE COMPANY DECLARED AND PAID $0.15 PER SHARE, OR $6,308,000 IN THE AGGREGATE, IN CASH DIVIDENDS DURING THE THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND, DURING SUCH PERIOD, ALSO PAID $62,985,000 OF DIVIDENDS  PAYABLE WHICH WERE DECLARED DURING FISCAL YEAR 2017 AND INCLUDED IN CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 30, 2017. DURING THE THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MARCH 30, 2019, THE COMPANY PURCHASED 124,481 SHARES OF  ITS COMMON STOCK AT A TOTAL COST OF $12,977,000. DURING THE THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, THE COMPANY PURCHASED 14,354 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT A TOTAL COST OF $1,508,000. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, THE COMPANY MAY PURCHASE IN  THE AGGREGATE UP TO 1,875,519 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER ITS AUTHORIZED STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAMS. LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING CURRENT MATURITIES, WAS $116,430,000 AT MARCH 30, 2019, $11,995,000 LOWER THAN AT DECEMBER 29, 2018.  EQUITY WAS $728,260,000, OR 86% OF TOTAL CAPITALIZATION (DEFINED AS LONG-TERM DEBT INCLUDING CURRENT MATURITIES PLUS EQUITY), AT  MARCH 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $689,133,000, OR 84% OF TOTAL CAPITALIZATION, AT DECEMBER 29, 2018. THE INCREASE IN EQUITY WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF NET INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PURCHASES OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK AND  DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY THE COMPANY IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD.  ON JUNE 2, 2016, LANDSTAR ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A  SYNDICATE OF BANKS AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d). THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH MATURES ON JUNE 2, 2021, PROVIDES $250,000,000 OF BORROWING CAPACITY IN THE FORM OF A REVOLVING CREDIT  FACILITY, $50,000,000 OF WHICH MAY BE UTILIZED IN THE FORM OF LETTER OF CREDIT GUARANTEES. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES AN \u201cACCORDION\u201d FEATURE PROVIDING FOR A POSSIBLE INCREASE UP TO AN AGGREGATE BORROWING AMOUNT OF $400,000,000. THE  COMPANY\u2019S PRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED ON JUNE 2, 2016.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT  LIMIT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE INCURRENCE OF ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAINTAIN A MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND MAINTAIN A LEVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, BELOW A SPECIFIED MAXIMUM. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR A RESTRICTION ON CASH DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CAPITAL STOCK TO THE EXTENT THERE IS A DEFAULT UNDER THE CREDIT  AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF SUCH CASH DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS TO THE EXTENT THAT, AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO ANY PAYMENT MADE TO EFFECT SUCH CASH DIVIDEND OR  OTHER DISTRIBUTION, THE LEVERAGE RATIO WOULD EXCEED 2.5 TO 1 ON A PRO FORMA BASIS AS OF THE END OF THE COMPANY\u2019S MOST RECENTLY COMPLETED FISCAL QUARTER. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR AN EVENT OF DEFAULT IN THE EVENT THAT, AMONG OTHER  THINGS, A PERSON OR GROUP ACQUIRES 35% OR MORE OF THE OUTSTANDING CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY OR OBTAINS POWER TO ELECT A MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S DIRECTORS OR THE DIRECTORS CEASE TO CONSIST OF A MAJORITY OF CONTINUING DIRECTORS, AS DEFINED  IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONE OF THESE COVENANTS ARE PRESENTLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE MATERIALLY RESTRICTIVE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS, CAPITAL RESOURCES OR LIQUIDITY. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE DEBT  COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  AT MARCH 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AND $34,369,000 OF LETTERS OF  CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. AT MARCH 30, 2019, THERE WAS $215,631,000 AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS $62,345,000 IN LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING AS COLLATERAL FOR  INSURANCE CLAIMS THAT ARE SECURED BY INVESTMENTS TOTALING $69,272,000 AT MARCH 30, 2019. INVESTMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDE PRIMARILY INVESTMENT-GRADE BONDS HAVING MATURITIES OF UP TO FIVE YEARS. FAIR VALUE OF  INVESTMENTS IS BASED PRIMARILY ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES. SEE \u201cNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u201d INCLUDED HEREIN FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS GENERATED SUFFICIENT OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEET ITS DEBT  SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, FUND CONTINUED GROWTH, BOTH ORGANIC AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, COMPLETE OR EXECUTE SHARE PURCHASES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER AUTHORIZED SHARE PURCHASE PROGRAMS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND MEET WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS. AS AN ASSET-LIGHT  PROVIDER OF INTEGRATED TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OPERATING PROPERTY ARE GENERALLY FOR TRAILING EQUIPMENT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. IN ADDITION, A SIGNIFICANT  PORTION OF THE TRAILING EQUIPMENT USED BY THE COMPANY IS PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTY CAPACITY PROVIDERS, THEREBY REDUCING THE COMPANY\u2019S CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. DURING THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD, THE COMPANY PURCHASED $4,576,000 OF OPERATING  PROPERTY. LANDSTAR ANTICIPATES ACQUIRING EITHER BY PURCHASE OR LEASE FINANCING DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 APPROXIMATELY $66,000,000 IN OPERATING PROPERTY, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF NEW TRAILING EQUIPMENT TO REPLACE OLDER TRAILING  EQUIPMENT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT.  ON JANUARY 29, 2019, LANDSTAR ACQUIRED ALL OF THE REMAINING EQUITY INTERESTS IN  LANDSTAR METRO AND LANDSTAR SERVICIOS THEN HELD BY THE MINORITY EQUITYHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, AS OF SUCH DATE, LANDSTAR METRO AND LANDSTAR SERVICIOS EACH BECAME WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY. CASH CONSIDERATION PAID IN THE 2019 FIRST  QUARTER TO PURCHASE THESE REMAINING EQUITY INTERESTS WAS $600,000.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS COMBINED WITH THE  COMPANY\u2019S BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET LANDSTAR\u2019S DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, FUND CONTINUED GROWTH, BOTH INTERNAL AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, PAY DIVIDENDS, COMPLETE THE AUTHORIZED SHARE PURCHASE  PROGRAM AND MEET WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS.  LEGAL MATTERS  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE DESCRIPTIONS OF CERTAIN PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018. THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS DURING THE THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MARCH 30, 2019.  THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN CERTAIN CLAIMS AND PENDING LITIGATION ARISING FROM THE NORMAL CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. MANY OF THESE CLAIMS ARE COVERED  IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY INSURANCE. BASED ON KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, OPINIONS OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADEQUATE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR PROBABLE LOSSES WITH RESPECT TO THE RESOLUTION OF ALL SUCH CLAIMS  AND PENDING LITIGATION AND THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME, AFTER PROVISIONS THEREFOR, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY, BUT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN QUARTER OR  YEAR.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  LANDSTAR PROVIDES FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF SELF-INSURED CLAIMS PRIMARILY ON AN ACTUARIAL BASIS. THE AMOUNT RECORDED FOR THE ESTIMATED  LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS INCURRED IS BASED UPON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN ON THE APPLICABLE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS MAY BE FOR AN AMOUNT GREATER OR LESS THAN THE AMOUNT ESTIMATED BY MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANY  CONTINUALLY REVISES ITS EXISTING CLAIM ESTIMATES AS NEW OR REVISED INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE ON THE STATUS OF EACH CLAIM. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED BOTH FAVORABLE AND UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT OF PRIOR YEARS\u2019 CLAIMS ESTIMATES.  DURING THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS, INSURANCE AND CLAIMS COSTS INCLUDED $1,407,000 AND $2,558,000 OF NET UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS TO PRIOR YEARS\u2019 CLAIMS ESTIMATES, RESPECTIVELY. IT IS REASONABLY LIKELY THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF  SETTLING ALL OUTSTANDING CLAIMS WILL BE MORE OR LESS THAN THE ESTIMATED CLAIMS RESERVE AT MARCH 30, 2019.  SIGNIFICANT VARIANCES FROM  MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATES FOR THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF SELF-INSURED CLAIMS COULD BE EXPECTED TO POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AFFECT LANDSTAR\u2019S EARNINGS IN A GIVEN QUARTER OR YEAR. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF  THESE ITEMS, GIVEN A RANGE OF REASONABLY LIKELY OUTCOMES, WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE LONG-TERM FINANCIAL CONDITION OF LANDSTAR OR ITS ABILITY TO FUND ITS CONTINUING OPERATIONS.  EFFECTS OF INFLATION  MANAGEMENT DOES NOT  BELIEVE INFLATION HAS HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION OF LANDSTAR IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. HOWEVER, INFLATION IN EXCESS OF HISTORIC TRENDS MIGHT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SEASONALITY  LANDSTAR\u2019S OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL TRENDS COMMON TO THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY.

POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL USES OF CASH MAY INCLUDE THE ACQUISITION OF TECHNOLOGIES OR TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND REPURCHASES OF STOCK UNDER OUR AUTHORIZED STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM. HOWEVER, ANY REPURCHASES OF STOCK WILL BE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR STOCK, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR STOCK, AVAILABLE CAPITAL, ALTERNATIVE USES FOR CAPITAL AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF OUR ACTUAL INVESTING ACTIVITIES WILL VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, COSTS OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS, OUR TIMETABLE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE EXPANSION, STOCK REPURCHASE ACTIVITY AND COSTS RELATED TO OUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE, NOR HAVE WE EVER HAD, ANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ENTITIES REFERRED TO AS STRUCTURED FINANCE OR SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR FOR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES. IN ADDITION, WE DO NOT ENGAGE IN TRADING ACTIVITIES INVOLVING NON-EXCHANGE TRADED CONTRACTS. AS A RESULT, WE ARE NOT MATERIALLY EXPOSED TO ANY FINANCING, LIQUIDITY, MARKET OR CREDIT RISK THAT COULD ARISE IF WE ENGAGED IN THESE RELATIONSHIPS. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF REGULATION S-K PROMULGATED BY THE SEC.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF NET REVENUES, EXPENSES, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE REGULARLY EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING REVENUE RECOGNITION, INVENTORY AND RELATED RESERVES FOR EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY, ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, LESSEE RIGHT-OF-USE (ROU) ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES, GOODWILL, DEFERRED TAXES AND RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES, UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, TAX CONTINGENCIES, LITIGATION COSTS AND LOSS CONTINGENCIES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON CURRENT FACTS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE RECORDING OF REVENUE, COSTS AND EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. CHANGES IN JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO THESE ESTIMATES COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS. IF THESE ESTIMATES DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS, THE IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIAL.  EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 30, 2018, WE ADOPTED ASC 842, THE NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD GOVERNING LEASES.  SEE NOTE  2  TO OUR ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR ADOPTION OF THIS NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD. A DESCRIPTION OF OUR UPDATED ACCOUNTING POLICIES IMPACTED BY ASC 842 ARE INCLUDED BELOW.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  WE DERIVE THE MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCT REVENUE FROM FOUR PRIMARY SOURCES: (I) DIRECT SALES UNDER DEFERRED EQUIPMENT AGREEMENTS WITH END-USER HOSPITALS WHERE WE PROVIDE UP-FRONT MONITORING EQUIPMENT AT NO UP-FRONT CHARGE IN EXCHANGE FOR A MULTI-YEAR SENSOR PURCHASE COMMITMENT, (II) OTHER DIRECT SALES OF NONINVASIVE MONITORING SOLUTIONS TO END-USER HOSPITALS, EMERGENCY MEDICAL RESPONSE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER DIRECT CUSTOMERS; (III) SALES OF NONINVASIVE MONITORING SOLUTIONS TO DISTRIBUTORS WHO THEN TYPICALLY RESELL TO END-USER HOSPITALS, EMERGENCY MEDICAL RESPONSE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS; AND (IV) SALES OF INTEGRATED CIRCUIT BOARDS TO OEM CUSTOMERS WHO INCORPORATE OUR EMBEDDED SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY INTO THEIR MULTIPARAMETER MONITORING DEVICES. SUBJECT TO CUSTOMER CREDIT CONSIDERATIONS, THE MAJORITY OF SUCH SALES ARE MADE ON OPEN ACCOUNT USING INDUSTRY STANDARD PAYMENT TERMS BASED ON THE GEOGRAPHY WITHIN WHICH THE SPECIFIC CUSTOMER IS LOCATED.  WE GENERALLY RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOLLOWING A SINGLE, PRINCIPLES-BASED FIVE-STEP MODEL TO BE APPLIED TO ALL CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS AND GENERALLY PROVIDES FOR THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED, NET OF ALLOWANCES FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS, DISCOUNTS OR SALES INCENTIVES, AS WELL AS TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS THAT ARE REMITTED TO GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES, WHEN CONTROL OVER THE PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUE RELATED TO EQUIPMENT SUPPLIED UNDER SALES-TYPE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED ONCE CONTROL OVER THE EQUIPMENT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER, WHILE REVENUE RELATED TO EQUIPMENT SUPPLIED UNDER OPERATING-TYPE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE.  WHILE THE MAJORITY OF OUR SALES TRANSACTIONS CONTAIN STANDARD BUSINESS TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THERE ARE SOME TRANSACTIONS THAT CONTAIN NON-STANDARD BUSINESS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. AS A RESULT, CONTRACT INTERPRETATION AND ANALYSIS IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING, INCLUDING: (I) THE AMOUNT OF THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION, INCLUDING VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, (II) WHETHER THE ARRANGEMENT CONTAINS AN EMBEDDED LEASE, AND IF SO, WHETHER SUCH EMBEDDED LEASE IS A SALES-TYPE LEASE OR AN OPERATING LEASE, (III) HOW THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION WHEN MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS EXIST, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION OF STANDALONE SELLING PRICE, (IV) WHEN TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, AND (V) WHETHER UNCOMPLETED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE COMPLETED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. CHANGES IN JUDGMENTS ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.  WE ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS TO SELL OUR MONITORING SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES, SOMETIMES AS PART OF ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT INCLUDE VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF PRODUCT SALES, EQUIPMENT LEASES AND SERVICES. IN THE CASE OF CONTRACTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, THE AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE PROVIDES THAT THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION BE ALLOCATED TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION ON THE BASIS OF RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICES. WHEN A STANDALONE SELLING PRICE IS NOT READILY OBSERVABLE, WE ESTIMATE THE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE BY CONSIDERING MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHIES, TYPE OF CUSTOMER, CONTRACTUAL PRICES PURSUANT TO GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATION (GPO) CONTRACTS, OUR PRICING AND DISCOUNT PRACTICES, AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS.  SALES UNDER DEFERRED EQUIPMENT AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED SUCH THAT WE AGREE TO PROVIDE CERTAIN MONITORING-RELATED EQUIPMENT, SOFTWARE, INSTALLATION, TRAINING AND/OR WARRANTY SUPPORT AT NO UP-FRONT CHARGE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE HOSPITAL\u2019S AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE SENSORS OVER THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT, WHICH GENERALLY RANGES FROM THREE TO SIX YEARS. WE ALLOCATE CONTRACT CONSIDERATION UNDER DEFERRED EQUIPMENT AGREEMENTS CONTAINING FIXED ANNUAL SENSOR PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TO THE UNDERLYING LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS AT CONTRACT INCEPTION. IN DETERMINING WHETHER ANY UNDERLYING LEASE COMPONENTS ARE RELATED TO A SALES-TYPE LEASE OR AN OPERATING LEASE, WE EVALUATE THE CUSTOMER\u2019S RIGHTS AND ABILITY TO CONTROL THE USE OF THE UNDERLYING EQUIPMENT THROUGHOUT THE CONTRACT TERM, INCLUDING ANY EQUIPMENT SUBSTITUTION RIGHTS RETAINED BY US, AS WELL AS OUR EXPECTATIONS SURROUNDING POTENTIAL CONTRACT/LEASE EXTENSIONS OR RENEWALS AND THE CUSTOMER\u2019S EXERCISE OF ANY PURCHASE OPTIONS. REVENUE ALLOCABLE TO NON-LEASE COMPONENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS SUCH NON-LEASE COMPONENTS ARE SATISFIED. REVENUE ALLOCABLE TO LEASE COMPONENTS UNDER SALES-TYPE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THE LEASE COMMENCES. REVENUE ALLOCABLE TO LEASE COMPONENTS UNDER OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE OPERATING LEASE. WE GENERALLY DO NOT EXPECT TO DERIVE ANY SIGNIFICANT VALUE IN EXCESS OF SUCH ASSET\u2019S UNAMORTIZED BOOK VALUE FROM EQUIPMENT UNDERLYING OUR OPERATING LEASES ARRANGEMENTS.  REVENUE FROM DIRECT SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS TO END-USER HOSPITALS, EMERGENCY MEDICAL RESPONSE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER DIRECT CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS TO DISTRIBUTORS, IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED EITHER AT THE TIME OF DELIVERY OR AT SHIPMENT, BASED UPON THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT OR UNDERLYING PURCHASE ORDER.  SALES OF INTEGRATED CIRCUIT BOARDS AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO OUR OEMS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT. REVENUE RELATED TO OEM RAINBOW  \u00ae  PARAMETER SOFTWARE LICENSES IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT OF THE OEM\u2019S PRODUCT TO ITS CUSTOMERS, AS REPORTED TO US BY THE OEM.  WE PROVIDE CERTAIN CUSTOMERS WITH VARIOUS SALES INCENTIVES THAT MAY TAKE THE FORM OF DISCOUNTS OR REBATES. WE ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE ALLOWANCES FOR THESE PROGRAMS AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE AT THE TIME OF SALE. IN GENERAL, CUSTOMERS DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT OF RETURN FOR CREDIT OR REFUND. HOWEVER, WE ALLOW RETURNS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD, WE ESTIMATE AND ACCRUE FOR THESE RETURNS AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE. WE ESTIMATE THE REVENUE CONSTRAINTS RELATED TO THESE FORMS OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING EXPECTED PURCHASING VOLUMES, PRIOR SALES AND RETURNS HISTORY, AND SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND LIMITATIONS.  LESSEE ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES  WE DETERMINE IF AN ARRANGEMENT CONTAINS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. ROU ASSETS REPRESENT OUR RIGHT TO USE AN ASSET UNDERLYING AN OPERATING LEASE FOR THE LEASE TERM AND LEASE LIABILITIES REPRESENT OUR OBLIGATION TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS ARISING FROM AN OPERATING LEASE. ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. WE GENERALLY ESTIMATE THE APPLICABLE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO DETERMINE THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION AT THE LEASE COMMENCEMENT DATE. MANY OF OUR LESSEE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE OPTIONS TO EXTEND THE LEASE, WHICH WE DO NOT INCLUDE IN OUR LEASE TERMS UNLESS THEY ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO BE EXERCISED. WE UTILIZE A PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ROU ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN EQUIPMENT LEASES. WE HAVE ALSO MADE A POLICY ELECTION NOT TO SEPARATE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS FOR OUR REAL ESTATE LEASES AND TO EXCLUDE SHORT-TERM LEASES WITH A  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TERM OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS FROM OUR ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES. RENTAL EXPENSE FOR LEASE PAYMENTS RELATED TO OPERATING LEASES IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO ANY OF OUR OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  .

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS TOGETHER WITH OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10\u2010Q AND OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10\u2010K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 (THE \u201cANNUAL REPORT\u201d).  THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. AS A RESULT OF MANY FACTORS, SUCH AS THOSE DESCRIBED UNDER \u201cCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,\u201d \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF NOVEL THERAPEUTICS TO TREAT PROGRESSIVE NON-VIRAL LIVER DISEASES WITH HIGH UNMET MEDICAL NEED UTILIZING OUR PROPRIETARY BILE ACID CHEMISTRY. OUR FIRST MARKETED PRODUCT, OCALIVA  \u00ae  (OBETICHOLIC ACID OR \u201cOCA\u201d), IS AN FARNESOID X RECEPTOR (\u201cFXR\u201d) AGONIST APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION AND SEVERAL OTHER JURISDICTIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF PRIMARY BILIARY CHOLANGITIS (\u201cPBC\u201d) IN COMBINATION WITH URSODEOXYCHOLIC ACID (\u201cUDCA\u201d) IN ADULTS WITH AN INADEQUATE RESPONSE TO UDCA OR AS MONOTHERAPY IN ADULTS UNABLE TO TOLERATE UDCA. IN ADDITION TO COMMERCIALIZING OCA FOR PBC UNDER THE OCALIVA BRAND NAME, WE ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING OCA FOR MULTIPLE INDICATIONS, INCLUDING NONALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS (\u201cNASH\u201d). WE ARE ALSO DEVELOPING SEVERAL OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES IN VARIOUS STAGES OF CLINICAL AND PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT OCA AND OUR OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO TREAT ORPHAN AND OTHER MORE PREVALENT LIVER DISEASES SUCH AS NASH FOR WHICH THERE ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS.  OCALIVA WAS APPROVED FOR PBC BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) IN MAY 2016 UNDER THE ACCELERATED APPROVAL PATHWAY. WE COMMENCED SALES AND MARKETING OF OCALIVA IN THE UNITED STATES SHORTLY AFTER RECEIVING APPROVAL, AND OCALIVA IS NOW AVAILABLE TO U.S. PATIENTS PRIMARILY THROUGH A NETWORK OF SPECIALTY PHARMACY DISTRIBUTORS. OCALIVA RECEIVED CONDITIONAL APPROVAL FOR PBC FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IN DECEMBER 2016 AND WE COMMENCED OUR EUROPEAN COMMERCIAL LAUNCH IN JANUARY 2017. WE HAVE SUBMITTED DOSSIERS AND OBTAINED, OR ARE OTHERWISE PURSUING, REIMBURSEMENT FROM A NUMBER OF NATIONAL AUTHORITIES IN EUROPE. SINCE JANUARY 2017, OCALIVA HAS ALSO RECEIVED REGULATORY APPROVAL IN SEVERAL OF OUR TARGET MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, INCLUDING CANADA, ISRAEL AND AUSTRALIA, AND WE ARE PURSUING MARKETING APPROVAL OF OCALIVA FOR PBC IN OUR OTHER INTERNATIONAL TARGET MARKETS. OCALIVA RECEIVED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR THE TREATMENT OF PBC.  OUR LEAD PRODUCT CANDIDATE IS OCA FOR THE POTENTIAL TREATMENT OF NASH. IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE ANNOUNCED TOPLINE RESULTS FROM THE PLANNED 18-MONTH INTERIM ANALYSIS OF OUR PIVOTAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL OF OCA IN PATIENTS WITH LIVER FIBROSIS DUE TO NASH, KNOWN AS THE REGENERATE TRIAL. IN THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ANALYSIS, ONCE-DAILY OCA 25 MG MET THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT AGREED WITH THE FDA OF FIBROSIS IMPROVEMENT BY AT LEAST ONE STAGE WITH NO WORSENING OF NASH AT THE PLANNED 18-MONTH INTERIM ANALYSIS AND ADVERSE EVENTS WERE GENERALLY MILD TO MODERATE IN SEVERITY AND THE MOST COMMON WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE KNOWN PROFILE OF OCA. OCA ALSO ACHIEVED THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT IN A PHASE 2B CLINICAL TRIAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF NASH COMPLETED IN LATE JULY 2014, KNOWN AS THE FLINT TRIAL, WHICH WAS SPONSORED BY THE U.S. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES, A PART OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. OCA HAS RECEIVED BREAKTHROUGH THERAPY DESIGNATION FROM THE FDA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NASH PATIENTS WITH LIVER FIBROSIS. WE CURRENTLY INTEND TO FILE A NEW DRUG APPLICATION (\u201cNDA\u201d) WITH THE FDA IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 SEEKING APPROVAL OF OCA FOR NASH, AND A MARKETING AUTHORIZATION APPLICATION (\u201cMAA\u201d) WITH THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY (\u201cEMA\u201d) FOR OCA FOR NASH IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS EXPANDING OUR OVERALL NASH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WITH ADDITIONAL TRIALS AND STUDIES, INCLUDING OUR ONGOING PHASE 3 TRIAL IN NASH PATIENTS WITH COMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS, KNOWN AS THE REVERSE TRIAL.  AS PART OF OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL OF OCA IN OTHER PROGRESSIVE NON-VIRAL LIVER DISEASES BEYOND PBC AND NASH. WE ALSO INTEND TO STUDY OCA IN COMBINATION WITH BEZAFIBRATE, A PAN-PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR-ACTIVATED RECEPTOR (\u201cPPAR\u201d) AGONIST, IN PATIENTS WITH PBC AND POTENTIALLY OTHER LIVER DISEASES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A PIPELINE OF ADDITIONAL COMPOUNDS IN EARLY STAGES OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  PHASE 3 REGENERATE TRIAL TOPLINE RESULTS  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE ANNOUNCED TOPLINE RESULTS FROM OUR PIVOTAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL OF OCA IN PATIENTS WITH LIVER FIBROSIS DUE TO NASH, KNOWN AS THE REGENERATE TRIAL. IN THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ANALYSIS, ONCE-DAILY OCA 25 MG MET, WITH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE, THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT AGREED WITH THE FDA OF FIBROSIS IMPROVEMENT BY AT LEAST ONE STAGE WITH NO WORSENING OF NASH (DEFINED AS NO WORSENING OF HEPATOCELLULAR BALLOONING, NO WORSENING OF LOBULAR INFLAMMATION AND NO WORSENING OF STEATOSIS) AT THE PLANNED 18-MONTH ANALYSIS AND ADVERSE EVENTS WERE GENERALLY MILD TO MODERATE IN SEVERITY AND THE MOST COMMON WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE KNOWN PROFILE OF OCA. ALTHOUGH A NUMERICALLY GREATER PROPORTION OF PATIENTS IN BOTH OCA TREATMENT GROUPS COMPARED TO PLACEBO ACHIEVED THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT OF NASH RESOLUTION WITH NO WORSENING OF LIVER FIBROSIS IN THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ANALYSIS, THIS RESULT DID NOT REACH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. NASH RESOLUTION IS DEFINED AS THE OVERALL HISTOPATHOLOGIC INTERPRETATION OF (I) NO FATTY LIVER DISEASE OR (II) FATTY LIVER DISEASE (SIMPLE OR ISOLATED STEATOSIS) WITHOUT STEATOHEPATITIS AND A NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE ACTIVITY SCORE (\u201cNAS\u201d) OF 0 FOR BALLOONING AND 0-1 FOR INFLAMMATION. AS AGREED WITH THE FDA, IN ORDER FOR THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE TO BE MET, THE STUDY WAS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE ONE OF THE TWO PRIMARY ENDPOINTS. WE CURRENTLY INTEND TO FILE AN NDA WITH THE FDA IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 SEEKING APPROVAL OF OCA FOR NASH, AND AN MAA WITH THE EMA FOR OCA FOR NASH IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. REGENERATE IS PLANNED TO CONTINUE THROUGH CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN ORDER TO CONFIRM CLINICAL BENEFIT. THE END-OF-STUDY ANALYSIS WILL EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF OCA ON MORTALITY AND LIVER-RELATED CLINICAL OUTCOMES, AS WELL AS ITS LONG-TERM SAFETY.  FINANCIAL OVERVIEW  REVENUE  WE COMMENCED OUR COMMERCIAL LAUNCH OF OCALIVA FOR THE TREATMENT OF PBC IN THE UNITED STATES IN JUNE 2016. IN DECEMBER 2016, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION GRANTED CONDITIONAL APPROVAL FOR OCALIVA FOR THE TREATMENT OF PBC AND WE COMMENCED OUR EUROPEAN COMMERCIAL LAUNCH IN JANUARY 2017. SINCE JANUARY 2017, OCALIVA HAS ALSO RECEIVED REGULATORY APPROVAL IN SEVERAL OF OUR TARGET MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, INCLUDING CANADA, ISRAEL AND AUSTRALIA. WE SELL OCALIVA TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF SPECIALTY PHARMACIES WHICH DISPENSE THE PRODUCT DIRECTLY TO PATIENTS. THE SPECIALTY PHARMACIES ARE REFERRED TO AS OUR CUSTOMERS.  EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, WE BEGAN RECOGNIZING REVENUE UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 606,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (\u201cASC 606\u201d). THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THIS REVENUE STANDARD IS THAT A COMPANY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. THE FOLLOWING FIVE STEPS ARE APPLIED TO ACHIEVE THAT CORE PRINCIPLE.  \u00b7  STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE CONTRACT WITH THE CUSTOMER  \u00b7  STEP 2: IDENTIFY THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT  \u00b7  STEP 3: DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE  \u00b7  STEP 4: ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT  \u00b7  STEP 5: RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN THE COMPANY SATISFIES A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION  PRODUCT REVENUE, NET  WE PROVIDE THE RIGHT OF RETURN TO OUR CUSTOMERS FOR UNOPENED PRODUCT FOR A LIMITED TIME BEFORE AND AFTER ITS EXPIRATION DATE. PRIOR TO JULY 2017, GIVEN OUR LIMITED SALES HISTORY FOR OCALIVA AND THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES IN ESTIMATING PRODUCT RETURNS, WE DETERMINED THAT THE SHIPMENTS OF OCALIVA MADE TO OUR CUSTOMERS DID NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT. ACCORDINGLY, WE RECOGNIZED REVENUE WHEN THE PRODUCT WAS SOLD THROUGH BY OUR CUSTOMERS, PROVIDED ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA WERE MET. WE INVOICED OUR CUSTOMERS UPON SHIPMENT OF OCALIVA TO THEM AND RECORDED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY FOR DEFERRED REVENUE EQUAL TO THE GROSS INVOICE PRICE. WE THEN RECOGNIZED REVENUE WHEN OCALIVA WAS SOLD THROUGH AS SPECIALTY PHARMACIES DISPENSED PRODUCT DIRECTLY TO THE PATIENTS (SELL-THROUGH BASIS). WE RE-EVALUATED OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INCLUDED THE ACCUMULATION AND REVIEW OF CUSTOMER-RELATED TRANSACTIONS SINCE OUR COMMERCIAL LAUNCH IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2016. WE CONCLUDED WE HAD ACCUMULATED SUFFICIENT DATA TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE PRODUCT RETURNS AND, THEREFORE, BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT TO OUR CUSTOMERS (SELL-IN BASIS).  UNDER ASC 606, WE HAVE WRITTEN CONTRACTS WITH EACH OF OUR CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE A SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION \u2014 TO DELIVER PRODUCTS UPON RECEIPT OF A CUSTOMER ORDER \u2014 AND THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED WHEN DELIVERY OCCURS AND THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES OCALIVA. WE EVALUATE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF EACH OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER COLLECTION IS REASONABLY ASSURED. WE ESTIMATE VARIABLE REVENUE BY CALCULATING GROSS PRODUCT REVENUES BASED ON THE WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COST THAT WE CHARGE OUR CUSTOMERS FOR OCALIVA, AND THEN ESTIMATING OUR NET PRODUCT REVENUES BY DEDUCTING (I) TRADE ALLOWANCES, SUCH AS INVOICE DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT AND CUSTOMER FEES, (II) ESTIMATED GOVERNMENT REBATES AND DISCOUNTS RELATED TO MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND OTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, AND (III) ESTIMATED COSTS OF INCENTIVES OFFERED TO CERTAIN INDIRECT CUSTOMERS INCLUDING PATIENTS.  WE RECOGNIZED NET SALES OF OCALIVA OF $51.8 MILLION AND $35.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  LICENSING REVENUE  IN MARCH 2011, WE ENTERED INTO AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cORIGINAL SUMITOMO AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH SUMITOMO DAINIPPON PHARMA CO., LTD. (\u201cSUMITOMO DAINIPPON\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH WE GRANTED TO SUMITOMO DAINIPPON AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO RESEARCH, DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE OCA FOR THE TREATMENT OF PBC AND NASH IN JAPAN AND CHINA (EXCLUDING TAIWAN) AND AN OPTION TO RESEARCH, DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE OCA IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF SUCH TERRITORIES (THE \u201cCOUNTRY OPTION\u201d). WE RECEIVED AN UPFRONT PAYMENT FROM SUMITOMO DAINIPPON OF $15.0 MILLION UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL SUMITOMO AGREEMENT. IN MAY 2014, SUMITOMO DAINIPPON EXERCISED THE COUNTRY OPTION IN PART TO ADD KOREA AS PART OF ITS LICENSED TERRITORIES AND PAID US A $1.0 MILLION UPFRONT FEE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. IN FEBRUARY 2018, WE AND SUMITOMO DAINIPPON ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT NO. 3 (THE \u201cSUMITOMO AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE ORIGINAL SUMITOMO AGREEMENT (AS AMENDED, THE \u201cSUMITOMO AGREEMENT\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH (I) SUMITOMO DAINIPPON AGREED TO RETURN THE RIGHTS TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE OCA IN JAPAN AND KOREA AND WAIVED ITS RIGHTS TO THE COUNTRY OPTION, (II) WE AGREED TO FOREGO ANY FURTHER MILESTONE OR ROYALTY PAYMENTS RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OCA IN JAPAN AND KOREA AND (III) CERTAIN MILESTONE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OCA WERE ADJUSTED. IN ADDITION, WE AND SUMITOMO DAINIPPON AGREED THAT IF CERTAIN CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES IN CHINA ARE NOT MET BY DECEMBER 31, 2020, SUMITOMO DAINIPPON MAY CHOOSE EITHER TO MAKE A MILESTONE PAYMENT TO US OR TERMINATE THE SUMITOMO AGREEMENT. SUMITOMO DAINIPPON MAY ALSO TERMINATE THE SUMITOMO AGREEMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY OR ON AN INDICATION-BY-INDICATION BASIS AT ANY TIME UPON 90 DAYS\u2019 WRITTEN NOTICE.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD ACHIEVED $6.0 MILLION OF DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES UNDER THE SUMITOMO AGREEMENT.  WE MAY BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS UNDER THE SUMITOMO AGREEMENT IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF UP TO APPROXIMATELY $23.0 MILLION BASED ON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN CLINICAL TRIAL AND REGULATORY-RELATED EVENTS AND TIERED ROYALTY PAYMENTS UP TO THE MID-TWENTIES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS BASED ON NET SALES OF OCA PRODUCTS IN CHINA (EXCLUDING TAIWAN).  FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, THE UPFRONT PAYMENTS WERE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE AND AMORTIZED OVER TIME AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ONCE EARNED. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, WE RECOGNIZED $0.4 MILLION AND $0.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN LICENSING REVENUE RELATED TO THE AMORTIZATION OF THE UPFRONT PAYMENTS UNDER THE SUMITOMO AGREEMENT.

AS A RESULT, OUR CONSUMABLE PRODUCTS PROVIDE A MORE STABLE RECURRING SOURCE OF REVENUE AND GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE THE SAME DEGREE OF CYCLICALITY AS OUR CAPITAL EQUIPMENT PRODUCTS.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019, OUR NET SALES INCREASED 55.3% YEAR-OVER-YEAR TO $147.8 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN OUR NET SALES WAS DRIVEN BY THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA CORPORATION, COMPLETED ON OCTOBER 1, 2018, AND OUR RESULTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER INCLUDED SALES OF $82.5 MILLION CONTRIBUTED BY THIS ACQUIRED BUSINESS.  THE GLOBAL SEMICONDUCTOR MARKET GREW IN 2018 REACHING A PEAK IN THE SECOND QUARTER WITH BUSINESS CONDITIONS SOFTENING DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2018. THIS WEAKNESS HAS CONTINUED INTO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND CUSTOMER TEST CELL UTILIZATION REMAINS BELOW LEVELS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY TRIGGERED THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPACITY. CURRENT MARKET WEAKNESS IS BEING DRIVEN BY LOWER SMARTPHONE UNIT SHIPMENTS, WEAKER AUTOMOTIVE SEMICONDUCTOR DEMAND, AND ONGOING SOFTNESS IN THE CHINA MARKET THAT IS IN PART RELATED TO TRADE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA. THE CURRENT NEAR TERM OUTLOOK FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY FOR 2019 ASSUMES SLOWER ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT DEMAND AND SLOWER GROWTH FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. DESPITE THE NEAR TERM WEAKNESS, WE REMAIN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE LONG-TERM PROSPECTS FOR OUR BUSINESS DUE TO INCREASING UBIQUITY OF SEMICONDUCTORS, THE FUTURE ROLLOUT OF 5G NETWORKS, DIMINISHING IMPACT OF PARALLEL TEST, INCREASING SEMICONDUCTOR COMPLEXITY, INCREASING QUALITY DEMANDS FROM SEMICONDUCTOR CUSTOMERS, AND CONTINUED PROLIFERATION OF ELECTRONICS IN A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS ACROSS THE AUTOMOTIVE, MOBILITY AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS. WE ARE FOCUSED ON GROWING OUR MARKET SHARE WITH SEMICONDUCTOR AND ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURERS AND TEST SUBCONTRACTORS.  APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  AND POLICIES  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, FORECASTS AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, HOWEVER ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. THE METHODS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS WE REPORT IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SOME OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE US TO MAKE DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COHU, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  MARCH 30, 2019  OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO AN INVESTOR\u2019S UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION AND THAT REQUIRE COMPLEX MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT INCLUDE.  \u25cf  REVENUE RECOGNITION, INCLUDING THE DEFERRAL OF REVENUE ON SALES TO CUSTOMERS, WHICH IMPACTS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS;  \u25cf  ESTIMATION OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES, SPECIFICALLY PRODUCT WARRANTY, INVENTORY RESERVES AND ALLOWANCE FOR BAD DEBTS, WHICH IMPACT GROSS MARGIN OR OPERATING EXPENSES;  \u25cf  THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WHICH IMPACT OUR TAX PROVISION;  \u25cf  THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH PRIMARILY IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN OR OPERATING EXPENSES IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENTS OF ASSETS OR ACCELERATE THEIR DEPRECIATION OR AMORTIZATION; AND  \u25cf  THE VALUATION AND RECOGNITION OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, WHICH IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE, AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE.  BELOW, WE DISCUSS THESE POLICIES FURTHER, AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED. WE ALSO HAVE OTHER POLICIES THAT WE CONSIDER KEY ACCOUNTING POLICIES; HOWEVER, THESE POLICIES TYPICALLY DO NOT REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS THAT ARE DIFFICULT OR SUBJECTIVE.  REVENUE RECOGNITION.  OUR NET SALES ARE DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ARE ADJUSTED FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN INSIGNIFICANT. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TERMS OF A CONTRACT WITH OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SATISFIED; GENERALLY, THIS OCCURS WITH THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL OF OUR SYSTEMS, NON-SYSTEM PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE CONTROL IS NOT TRANSFERRED UNTIL DESTINATION OR ACCEPTANCE, WE DEFER REVENUE RECOGNITION UNTIL SUCH EVENTS OCCUR. REVENUE FOR ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY SATISFIED A CUSTOMER\u2019S ACCEPTANCE REQUIREMENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT. IN CASES WHERE A PRIOR HISTORY OF CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE CANNOT BE DEMONSTRATED OR FROM SALES WHERE CUSTOMER PAYMENT DATES ARE NOT DETERMINABLE AND IN THE CASE OF NEW PRODUCTS, REVENUE AND COST OF SALES ARE DEFERRED UNTIL CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE HAS BEEN RECEIVED. OUR POST-SHIPMENT OBLIGATIONS TYPICALLY INCLUDE INSTALLATION AND STANDARD WARRANTIES. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF INSTALLATION RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD THE INSTALLATION IS PERFORMED. SERVICE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME AS THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL IS COMPLETED FOR THE RELATED CONTRACT OR UPON COMPLETION OF THE SERVICES IF THEY ARE SHORT-TERM IN NATURE. SPARES, CONTACTOR AND KIT REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT. CERTAIN OF OUR EQUIPMENT SALES HAVE MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVE THE DELIVERY OR PERFORMANCE OF MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, AND TRANSFER OF CONTROL OF PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS MAY OCCUR AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME OR OVER DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME. FOR ARRANGEMENTS CONTAINING MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, THE REVENUE RELATING TO THE UNDELIVERED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS DEFERRED USING THE RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE METHOD UTILIZING ESTIMATED SALES PRICES UNTIL SATISFACTION OF THE DEFERRED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. UNSATISFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY REPRESENT CONTRACTS FOR PRODUCTS WITH FUTURE DELIVERY DATES. AT MARCH 30, 2019, WE HAVE $16.8 MILLION OF REVENUE EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FUTURE RELATED TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE UNSATISFIED (OR PARTIALLY UNSATISFIED) FOR CONTRACTS WITH ORIGINAL EXPECTED DURATIONS OF OVER ONE YEAR.  AS ALLOWED UNDER ASC 606, WE HAVE OPTED TO NOT DISCLOSE UNSATISFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AS THESE CONTRACTS HAVE ORIGINAL EXPECTED DURATIONS OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR. WE GENERALLY SELL OUR EQUIPMENT WITH A PRODUCT WARRANTY. THE PRODUCT WARRANTY PROVIDES ASSURANCE TO CUSTOMERS THAT DELIVERED PRODUCTS ARE AS SPECIFIED IN THE CONTRACT (AN \u201cASSURANCE-TYPE WARRANTY\u201d). THEREFORE, WE ACCOUNT FOR SUCH PRODUCT WARRANTIES UNDER ASC 460, GUARANTEES (ASC 460), AND NOT AS A SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. THE TRANSACTION PRICE REFLECTS OUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE CONSIDERATION WE WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE FROM THE CUSTOMER AND MAY INCLUDE FIXED OR VARIABLE AMOUNTS. FIXED CONSIDERATION PRIMARILY INCLUDES SALES TO CUSTOMERS THAT ARE KNOWN AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. VARIABLE CONSIDERATION INCLUDES SALES IN WHICH THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION THAT WE WILL RECEIVE IS UNKNOWN AS OF THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD. SUCH CONSIDERATION PRIMARILY INCLUDES SALES MADE TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS WITH CUMULATIVE TIER VOLUME DISCOUNTS OFFERED. VARIABLE CONSIDERATION ARRANGEMENTS ARE RARE; HOWEVER, WHEN THEY OCCUR, WE ESTIMATE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION AS THE EXPECTED VALUE TO WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED. INCLUDED IN THE TRANSACTION PRICE ESTIMATE ARE AMOUNTS IN WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL OF CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED WILL NOT OCCUR WHEN THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION IS SUBSEQUENTLY RESOLVED. THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE FOR PROJECTED FUTURE SALES. VARIABLE CONSIDERATION THAT DOES NOT MEET REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA IS DEFERRED. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE REPRESENTS OUR UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT TO RECEIVE CONSIDERATION FROM OUR CUSTOMER. PAYMENTS TERMS DO NOT EXCEED ONE YEAR FROM THE INVOICE DATE AND THEREFORE DO NOT INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENT. TO DATE, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CONTRACT ASSETS OR CONTRACT LIABILITIES RECORDED ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IN ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED. ON SHIPMENTS WHERE SALES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED, GROSS PROFIT IS GENERALLY RECORDED AS DEFERRED PROFIT IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REPRESENTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECEIVABLE RECORDED AND THE INVENTORY SHIPPED.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  WE MAINTAIN AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS DETERIORATES, RESULTING IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES MAY BE REQUIRED.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COHU, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  MARCH 30, 2019  INVENTORY.  THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY AS WELL AS INVENTORY THAT IS NOT OF SALEABLE QUALITY. THE DETERMINATION OF OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THE DEMAND FORECAST IS A DIRECT INPUT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SHORT-TERM MANUFACTURING PLANS. WE RECORD VALUATION RESERVES ON OUR INVENTORY FOR ESTIMATED EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY AND LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE CONCERNS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST OF INVENTORY AND THE ESTIMATED REALIZABLE VALUE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE PRODUCT DEMAND, MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT SELLING PRICES. IF FUTURE PRODUCT DEMAND, MARKET CONDITIONS OR PRODUCT SELLING PRICES ARE LESS THAN THOSE PROJECTED BY MANAGEMENT OR IF CONTINUED MODIFICATIONS TO PRODUCTS ARE REQUIRED TO MEET SPECIFICATIONS OR OTHER CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, INCREASES TO INVENTORY RESERVES MAY BE REQUIRED WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN.  INCOME TAXES.  WE ESTIMATE OUR LIABILITY FOR INCOME TAXES BASED ON THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THIS REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE OUR (I) CURRENT TAXES; (II) TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES THAT RESULT FROM DIFFERING TREATMENT OF CERTAIN ITEMS FOR TAX AND ACCOUNTING PURPOSES AND (III) UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULT IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IF, BASED UPON ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. ESTABLISHING, REDUCING OR INCREASING A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN AN ACCOUNTING PERIOD GENERALLY RESULTS IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE IN TAX EXPENSE IN THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. WE MUST MAKE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS TO DETERMINE THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND ANY VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO BE RECORDED AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. OUR GROSS DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, WAS APPROXIMATELY $126.3 MILLION, WITH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $83.9 MILLION. OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF RESERVES AND ACCRUALS THAT ARE NOT YET DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX AND TAX CREDIT AND NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS.  SEGMENT  INFORMATION.  WE APPLIED THE PROVISIONS OF ASC TOPIC 280,  SEGMENT REPORTING  , (\u201cASC 280\u201d), WHICH SETS FORTH A MANAGEMENT APPROACH TO SEGMENT REPORTING AND ESTABLISHES REQUIREMENTS TO REPORT SELECTED SEGMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY AND TO REPORT ANNUALLY ENTITY-WIDE DISCLOSURES ABOUT PRODUCTS, MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND THE GEOGRAPHIES IN WHICH THE ENTITY HOLDS MATERIAL ASSETS AND REPORTS REVENUE. AN OPERATING SEGMENT IS DEFINED AS A COMPONENT THAT ENGAGES IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES WHOSE OPERATING RESULTS ARE REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER AND FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. AFTER THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA ON OCTOBER 1, 2018, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT OUR FOUR IDENTIFIED OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE: TEST HANDLER GROUP (\u201cTHG\u201d), SEMICONDUCTOR TEST GROUP (\u201cSTG\u201d), INTERFACE SOLUTIONS GROUP (\u201cISG\u201d) AND PCB TEST GROUP (\u201cPTG\u201d). OUR THG, STG AND ISG OPERATING SEGMENTS QUALIFY FOR AGGREGATION UNDER ASC 280 DUE TO SIMILARITIES IN THEIR CUSTOMERS, THEIR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS, AND THE NATURE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED. AS A RESULT, WE REPORT IN TWO SEGMENTS, SEMICONDUCTOR TEST & INSPECTION AND PCB TEST.  GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  WE EVALUATE GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BY FIRST COMPARING THE BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN THE BOOK VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE. WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS PRIMARILY USING THE INCOME APPROACH VALUATION METHODOLOGY THAT INCLUDES THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE MARKET APPROACH AND CERTAIN MARKET MULTIPLES AS A VALIDATION OF THE VALUES DERIVED USING THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. FORECASTS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF FUTURE NET SALES AND OPERATING EXPENSES, BASED PRIMARILY ON CUSTOMER FORECASTS, INDUSTRY TRADE ORGANIZATION DATA AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  WE CONDUCT OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST AS OF OCTOBER 1ST OF EACH YEAR, AND HAVE DETERMINED THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2018, AS WE DETERMINED THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES ON THAT DATE. OTHER EVENTS AND CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES MAY ALSO REQUIRE GOODWILL TO BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT DATES. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE OCCURRED THAT INDICATE IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL IS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT. IN THE EVENT WE DETERMINE THAT AN INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS REQUIRED, IN A FUTURE PERIOD, THE REVIEW MAY RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  LONG-LIVED ASSETS, OTHER THAN GOODWILL, ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSETS MIGHT NOT BE RECOVERABLE. CONDITIONS THAT WOULD NECESSITATE AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE OBSERVABLE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET, A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER IN WHICH AN ASSET IS USED, OR ANY OTHER SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS, IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE ONLY RECORDED IF THE ASSET\u2019S CARRYING AMOUNT IS NOT RECOVERABLE THROUGH ITS UNDISCOUNTED, PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. WE MEASURE THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COHU, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  MARCH 30, 2019  WARRANTY.  WE PROVIDE FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF PRODUCT WARRANTIES IN THE PERIOD SALES ARE RECOGNIZED. OUR WARRANTY OBLIGATION ESTIMATES ARE AFFECTED BY HISTORICAL PRODUCT SHIPMENT LEVELS, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS INCURRED IN CORRECTING PRODUCT PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS. SHOULD PRODUCT PERFORMANCE, MATERIAL USAGE OR LABOR REPAIR COSTS DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITY WOULD BE REQUIRED.  CONTINGENCIES.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONTINGENCIES THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESSES WHICH REQUIRE US TO ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT FUTURE EVENTS WILL CONFIRM THE EXISTENCE OF A LOSS OR AN IMPAIRMENT OF AN ASSET. IF A LOSS OR ASSET IMPAIRMENT IS PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS OR IMPAIRMENT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, WE ACCRUE A CHARGE TO OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD SUCH CONDITIONS BECOME KNOWN.  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE GRANT DATE, REDUCED BY THE PRESENT VALUE OF DIVIDENDS EXPECTED TO BE PAID ON OUR COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO VESTING OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ON PERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS WITH MARKET-BASED GOALS IS CALCULATED USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION MODEL ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO STOCK OPTIONS IS RECORDED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD ON ITS GRANT DATE, WHICH WE ESTIMATE USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES VALUATION MODEL.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, INCLUDING THE EXPECTED DATES OF ADOPTION AND ESTIMATED EFFECTS, IF ANY, ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SEE \u201cRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\u201d, IN NOTE 1 LOCATED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  RECENT TRANSACTIONS IMPACTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  ON OCTOBER 1, 2018 WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA CORPORATION AND THE RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ONLY SINCE THAT DATE. MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE FIXTURES SERVICES BUSINESS, THAT WAS ACQUIRED AS PART OF XCERRA, DOES NOT ALIGN WITH COHU\u2019S LONG-TERM STRATEGIC PLAN AND MANAGEMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF DIVESTING THIS PORTION OF THE BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, THE ASSETS OF OUR FIXTURES BUSINESS ARE CONSIDERED \u201cHELD FOR SALE\u201d AND THE OPERATIONS OF OUR FIXTURES BUSINESS ARE CONSIDERED \u201cDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\u201d AS OF MARCH 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 29, 2018. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, THE DISCUSSION BELOW COVERS THE COMPARATIVE RESULTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES CERTAIN OPERATING DATA AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30,  MARCH 31,  2019  2018  NET SALES  100.0%  100.0%  COST OF SALES  (1)  (63.2  )%  (57.7  )%  GROSS MARGIN  (1)  36.8%  42.3%  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  (15.4  )%  (12.4  )%  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  (1)  (25.9  )%  (16.6  )%  AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS  (1)  (6.8  )%  (1.1  )%  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  (0.9  )%  -%  INCOME (LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS  (12.2  )%  12.2%  (1)  IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA WE ASSESSED THE NEED TO REALIGN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION AND CERTAIN INCOME STATEMENT CLASSIFICATIONS WERE ADJUSTED WITH PRIOR PERIODS RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM WITH CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTATION. SEE NOTE 1, \u201cRECLASSIFICATIONS\u201d LOCATED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q.  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  NET SALES  OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES INCREASED 55.3% TO $147.8 MILLION IN 2019, COMPARED TO NET SALES OF $95.2 MILLION IN 2018. ON OCTOBER 1, 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA AND OUR NET SALES FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 INCLUDE $82.5 MILLION OF NET SALES RECOGNIZED BY THIS BUSINESS AND IS THE DRIVER OF THE INCREASE IN OUR NET SALES. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE ADDITIONAL SALES FROM XCERRA, NET SALES DECREASED YEAR OVER YEAR AS A RESULT OF SOFTER DEMAND FOR SMARTPHONES, WEAKER AUTOMOTIVE SEMICONDUCTOR DEMAND, ONGOING SOFTNESS IN THE CHINA MARKET THAT IS IN PART RELATED TO TRADE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA..  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COHU, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  MARCH 30, 2019  GROSS MARGIN  (EXCLUSIVE OF AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DESCRIBED BELOW)  GROSS MARGIN CONSISTS OF NET SALES LESS COST OF SALES. COST OF SALES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THE COST OF MATERIALS, ASSEMBLY AND TEST LABOR, AND OVERHEAD FROM OPERATIONS. OUR GROSS MARGIN CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD, PRODUCT SUPPORT COSTS, INVENTORY RESERVE ADJUSTMENTS, AND UTILIZATION OF MANUFACTURING CAPACITY. OUR GROSS MARGIN, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, WAS 36.8% IN 2019 AND 42.3% IN 2018. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE CERTAIN ITEMS WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY AFFECTED GROSS MARGIN ARE NOW BEING REFLECTED IN OPERATING EXPENSES. PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AMOUNTS WERE ALSO ADJUSTED TO REFLECT CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTATION. THIS RESULTED IN EXPENSES TOTALING $7.6 MILLION AND $0.7 MILLION BEING REPORTED IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES RATHER THAN COST OF SALES IN 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. INDEPENDENT OF THE IMPACT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECLASSIFICATIONS GROSS MARGIN IN 2019 WAS IMPACTED BY THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA AS DISCUSSED BELOW.  OUR COST OF SALES WAS IMPACTED BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INVENTORY STEP-UP RELATED TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS TO INVENTORY ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019, WE AMORTIZED $6.0 MILLION OF INVENTORY STEP-UP RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF XCERRA. THERE WAS NO INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZED IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2018.  OUR GROSS MARGIN CAN BE IMPACTED BY CHARGES TO COST OF SALES RELATED TO EXCESS, OBSOLETE AND LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE INVENTORY ISSUES. WE COMPUTE THE MAJORITY OF OUR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY RESERVE REQUIREMENTS USING A ONE-YEAR INVENTORY USAGE FORECAST. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND 2018, WE RECORDED CHARGES TO COST OF SALES OF APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION AND $0.7 MILLION FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, AS PART OF THE INTEGRATION AND RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO XCERRA WE RECORDED $0.5 MILLION OF INVENTORY RELATED CHARGES RELATED TO THE DECISION TO END MANUFACTURING OF CERTAIN OF XCERRA\u2019S SEMICONDUCTOR TEST HANDLER PRODUCTS. WHILE WE BELIEVE OUR RESERVES FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY AND LOWER OF COST OR MARKET CONCERNS ARE ADEQUATE TO COVER KNOWN EXPOSURES AT MARCH 30, 2019, REDUCTIONS IN CUSTOMER FORECASTS OR CONTINUED MODIFICATIONS TO PRODUCTS, AS A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO MEET SPECIFICATIONS OR OTHER CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CHARGES TO OPERATIONS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND GROSS MARGIN IN FUTURE PERIODS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE (\u201cR&D EXPENSE\u201d)  R&D EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND RELATED COSTS OF EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN ONGOING RESEARCH, PRODUCT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, COSTS OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES, AND PROFESSIONAL CONSULTING EXPENSES. R&D EXPENSE WAS $22.7 MILLION OR 15.4% OF NET SALES IN 2019, COMPARED TO $11.8 MILLION OR 12.4% IN 2018. THE INCREASE IN R&D EXPENSE IN 2019 WAS PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA, WHICH ADDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES TOTALING $12.0 MILLION. R&D EXPENSES UNRELATED TO XCERRA DECREASED DUE TO COST CONTROL INITIATIVES IMPLEMENTED AS A RESULT OF CURRENT BUSINESS CONDITIONS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE (\u201cSG&A EXPENSE\u201d)  SG&A EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND BENEFIT COSTS OF EMPLOYEES, COMMISSION EXPENSE FOR INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES, PRODUCT PROMOTION AND COSTS OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. SG&A EXPENSE WAS $38.3  MILLION OR 25.9% OF NET SALES IN 2019, COMPARED TO $15.8 MILLION OR 16.6% IN 2018. THE INCREASE IN SG&A EXPENSE IN 2019 WAS DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA, WHICH ADDED EXPENSES TOTALING $23.4 MILLION FROM ITS OPERATIONS. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, CERTAIN ITEMS WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY AFFECTED SG&A HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED INTANGIBLES AND FOREIGN TRANSACTION GAIN (LOSS) AND OTHER. PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AMOUNTS WERE ALSO ADJUSTED TO REFLECT CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION. THIS RESULTED IN EXPENSES TOTALING $2.4 MILLION AND $0.4 MILLION BEING REPORTED IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES RATHER THAN SG&A IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS TOTALING $0.2 MILLION AND LOSSES TOTALING $1.6 MILLION RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, ARE NOW REPORTED IN FOREIGN TRANSACTION GAIN (LOSS) AND OTHER. SG&A EXPENSES UNRELATED TO XCERRA\u2019S OPERATIONS WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER DUE TO THE DECREASE IN BUSINESS VOLUME.  AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS  AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED INTANGIBLES IS THE PROCESS OF EXPENSING THE COST OF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET ACQUIRED THROUGH A BUSINESS COMBINATION OVER THE PROJECTED LIFE OF THE ASSET. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE THESE AMOUNTS WERE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED IN COST OF SALES AND SG&A. AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WAS $10.0 MILLION AND $1.1 MILLION FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN EXPENSE RECORDED DURING THE CURRENT YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL AMORTIZATION ASSOCIATED WITH PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS RECORDED AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COHU, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  MARCH 30, 2019  SEE NOTE 2, \u201cBUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\u201d IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA ON OCTOBER 1, 2018, DURING FOURTH QUARTER 2018, WE BEGAN A STRATEGIC RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM DESIGNED TO REPOSITION OUR ORGANIZATION AND IMPROVE OUR COST STRUCTURE AS PART OF OUR TARGETED INTEGRATION PLAN REGARDING XCERRA AND RECORDED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, EXCLUSIVE OF THE $0.5 MILLION OF INVENTORY RELATED CHARGES DESCRIBED ABOVE, TOTALING $1.4 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019.  SEE NOTE 4, \u201cRESTRUCTURING CHARGES\u201d IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.  INTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $5.5 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO $11,000 IN THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF 2018. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERM LOAN B OBTAINED TO FINANCE PART OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF XCERRA.  INTEREST INCOME WAS $0.2 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF BOTH 2019 AND 2018.  INCOME  TAXES  ORDINARILY, INTERIM TAX PROVISIONS ARE CALCULATED USING THE ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (\u201cETR\u201d) EXPECTED TO BE APPLICABLE FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR. HOWEVER, WHEN A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE ANNUAL ETR CANNOT BE MADE, THE ACTUAL ETR FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD MAY BE THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE ANNUAL ETR. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019, WE USED THE ACTUAL YEAR-TO-DATE ETR IN COMPUTING OUR TAX PROVISION, AS A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE 2019 ANNUAL ETR CANNOT BE MADE, SINCE RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGES IN OUR PROJECTED INCOME PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN OUR ETR. IN COMPUTING THE TAX PROVISION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WE USED THE ETR EXPECTED TO BE APPLICABLE FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR. THE ETR ON INCOME OR LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019 AND MARCH 31, 2018 WAS 0.9% AND 20.8%, RESPECTIVELY. THE TAX PROVISION ON INCOME OR LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2019 AND 2018 DIFFERS FROM THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LACK OF A TAX BENEFIT ON OUR DOMESTIC LOSSES AS A RESULT OF OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, FOREIGN INCOME TAXED AT DIFFERENT RATES, CHANGES IN OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCE, STATE TAXES AND INTEREST RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.  OUR GERMAN SUBSIDIARIES INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2012 TO 2016 ARE CURRENTLY UNDER ROUTINE EXAMINATION BY TAX AUTHORITIES IN GERMANY. WE BELIEVE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENT ACCRUALS FOR INCOME TAXES ARE APPROPRIATE.  OTHER THAN FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, THERE WAS NO MATERIAL CHANGE TO OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND RELATED ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019 AND MARCH 31, 2018.  INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND NET INCOME  AS A RESULT OF THE FACTORS SET FORTH ABOVE, OUR LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND NET LOSS WAS $22.9 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019. IN 2018, INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND NET INCOME WAS $8.1 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURERS AND TEST SUBCONTRACTORS THAT ARE, IN TURN, DEPENDENT ON THE CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED MARKET DEMAND FOR SEMICONDUCTORS. THE SEASONAL AND VOLATILE NATURE OF DEMAND FOR SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT, OUR PRIMARY INDUSTRY, MAKES ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NET CASH FLOWS DIFFICULT.  OUR PRIMARY HISTORICAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES HAS BEEN CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS AND WE MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES TO MAXIMIZE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. WE USE CASH TO FUND GROWTH IN OUR OPERATING ASSETS AND TO FUND NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS PRIMARILY THROUGH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, $91.4 MILLION OR 57% OF OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IF THESE FUNDS ARE NEEDED FOR OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ACCRUE AND PAY FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES IF WE REPATRIATE THESE FUNDS. EXCEPT FOR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, WE PROVIDE FOR ALL WITHHOLDING AND OTHER RESIDUAL TAXES RELATED TO UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. BEGINNING IN 2018, EARNINGS REALIZED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO U.S. TAX IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TAX ACT.

MOBILE POINT OF SALE (MPOS) REMAINS A LARGE AND UNDERSERVED  SMALL BUSINESS MARKET AND IS INCREASINGLY BEING ADDRESSED BY MPOS SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS RUNNING ON IPAD AND ANDROID TABLETS. IN  Q1 2019, WE ALSO EXPERIENCED GROWTH IN MOBILE APPLICATIONS FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES, TRANSPORTATION AND HEALTH CARE.  COMPARED  TO THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO, Q1 2019 REVENUE FROM CUSTOMERS BASED IN THE AMERICAS INCREASED BY 22%, FROM ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS  INCREASED 38%, AND FROM CUSTOMERS BASED IN EUROPE DECREASED BY 23%.  GROSS  MARGINS  OUR  GROSS PROFIT MARGINS FOR THE FIRST QUARTERS OF BOTH 2019 AND 2018 WERE 52%.  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS $894,000, A DECREASE OF 6% COMPARED TO EXPENSES OF $947,000 IN THE SAME  QUARTER A YEAR AGO. DECREASE IN THE LEVEL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PERSONNEL COSTS REFLECTING  HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS IN FEBRUARY 2018. WE EXPECT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE TO INCREASE DURING THE BALANCE OF 2019 DUE TO  HEADCOUNT ADDITIONS TO FACILITATE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND UPDATE.  16  INDEX  SALES  AND MARKETING EXPENSE  SALES  AND MARKETING EXPENSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS $756,000, AN INCREASE OF 2% COMPARED TO EXPENSE OF $738,000 IN THE SAME  QUARTER A YEAR AGO.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO MODERATELY DECLINE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 FROM  THE FIRST QUARTER LEVELS AS THE COSTS OF OUR ANNUAL AUDIT ARE EXPENSED PRIMARILY IN THE FIRST QUARTER, AND TO REMAIN FLAT FOR  THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR.  INTEREST  EXPENSE, NET OF INTEREST INCOME  INTEREST  EXPENSE AND OTHER, NET OF INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER, WAS $29,000 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO $20,000 IN THE FIRST  QUARTER OF 2018. INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2019 WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO INTEREST ON BANK TERM LOAN AND CREDIT LINE FACILITIES (SEE  \u201cNOTE 4 \u2014 BANK FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\u201d FOR MORE INFORMATION). AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF BANK TERM LOAN  AND CREDIT LINES DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 WAS $1.5 MILLION. INTEREST EXPENSE IN Q1 2018 WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO  INTEREST ON THE TERM LOAN BORROWED FOR REPURCHASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. ADDITIONALLY, INTEREST EXPENSE IN EACH OF THE COMPARABLE  FIRST QUARTERS INCLUDES INTEREST ON EQUIPMENT LEASE FINANCING OBLIGATIONS.  INTEREST  INCOME REFLECTS INTEREST EARNED ON CASH BALANCES. INTEREST INCOME WAS NOMINAL IN EACH OF THE COMPARABLE FIRST QUARTERS, REFLECTING  LOW AVERAGE CASH BALANCES COMBINED WITH LOW AVERAGE RATES OF RETURN.  INCOME  TAXES  THE  TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017, EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2018, ELIMINATES ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAXES AND LOWERS THE U.S. FEDERAL  CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 34% TO 21%. CALIFORNIA CORPORATE NET INCOME TAX RATE IS 6.98% AFTER ALLOWING FOR FEDERAL DEDUCTIBILITY.  IN Q1 2019, OUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION OF $121,965 IS THE PRIMARY PERMANENT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FINANCIAL AND TAX EXPENSE WHICH  INCREASED OUR TAXABLE INCOME. WE ESTIMATED OUR FEDERAL AND STATE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO BE 36% IN Q1 2019 AND RECORDED A DEFERRED  TAX EXPENSE OF $6,670. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WE RECORDED A DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT OF $80,000 WITH THE EXPECTATION OF A RETURN  TO PROFITABLE OPERATING RESULTS AND FULL UTILIZATION OF OUR NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS. OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET, PRIMARILY  REPRESENTING FUTURE INCOME TAX SAVINGS FROM THE APPLICATION OF NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY FORWARDS, WAS VALUED AT $5,774,268 AT  MARCH 31, 2019.  WE  HAVE DETERMINED THAT UTILIZATION OF EXISTING NET OPERATING LOSSES AGAINST FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME IS NOT LIMITED BY SECTION 382  OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. FUTURE OWNERSHIP CHANGES, HOWEVER, MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY UTILIZE THE EXISTING NET OPERATING  LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AGAINST ANY FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE LIKELIHOOD TO REALIZE THE VALUE OF DEFERRED  TAX ASSETS IN THE FUTURE.  17  INDEX  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS  REFLECTED IN OUR STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS, NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $406,000 IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2019, COMPARED  TO NET CASH USED OF $389,000 IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD A YEAR AGO. WE CALCULATE NET CASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  BY INCREASING OUR NET INCOME ($11,839 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019) OR DECREASING OUR NET LOSS ($225,029 IN THE FIRST QUARTER  OF 2018) BY THOSE EXPENSES THAT DID NOT REQUIRE THE USE OF CASH. THESE ITEMS CONSIST OF STOCK BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION  AND AMORTIZATION, AND DEFERRED TAX EXPENSES AND BENEFITS. THESE AMOUNTS TOTALED $229,150 AND $123,600 IN THE FIRST QUARTERS OF  2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, WE REPORT INCREASES IN ASSETS AND REDUCTIONS IN LIABILITIES AS USES OF CASH AND DECREASES  IN ASSETS AND INCREASES IN LIABILITIES AS SOURCES OF CASH, TOGETHER REFERRED TO AS CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  IN  THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTED IN A NET USE OF CASH OF $647,000 AND WERE PRIMARILY  FROM INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE TO HIGHER SHIPMENTS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRST QUARTER AND INCREASES IN INVENTORY LEVELS.  THE USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED INVENTORY PURCHASES. IN  THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTED IN A NET USE OF CASH OF $287,000 PRIMARILY FROM  INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE TO HIGHER SHIPMENTS IN MARCH 2018.  IN  THE FIRST QUARTERS OF 2019 AND 2018, WE INVESTED $100,000 AND $164,000, RESPECTIVELY, IN MANUFACTURING TOOLING COSTS AND COMPUTER  SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS.  NET  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $351,000, COMPARED TO NET CASH USED OF $752,000  IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD A YEAR AGO.

OF THAT GROWTH, $21,010 WAS FROM THE ACQUISITIONS OF CLEMENT MAY  AND KRI COUPLED WITH  ORGANIC GROWTH OF $2,509.  THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE OF $4,337 FROM DIVESTING OF PEOPLESERVE AND  $1,144  FROM UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  WITHIN ORGANIC GROWTH, TEMPORARY CONTRACTOR REVENUE GREW $2,415 AND PERMANENT PLACEMENT GREW $94.  REVENUE IN Q1 2019 WAS COMPRISED OF $70,998 OF TEMPORARY CONTRACTOR REVENUE AND $2,831 OF PERMANENT PLACEMENT REVENUE, COMPARED WITH $52,997 AND $2,794 FOR Q1 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  DIRECT COST OF REVENUE, GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN  DIRECT COST OF SERVICES INCLUDES THE VARIABLE COST OF LABOR AND VARIOUS NON-VARIABLE COSTS (E.G., WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION INSURANCE) RELATING TO EMPLOYEES (TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT) AS WELL AS SUB-CONTRACTORS AND CONSULTANTS. FOR Q1 2019, DIRECT COST OF REVENUE WAS $61,711, AN INCREASE OF 39.6% FROM $44,210 IN Q1 2018, COMPARED WITH REVENUE GROWTH OF 32.3%.  17  STAFFING 360 SOLUTIONS, INC.

GROSS PROFIT GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS. THIS WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY  THE  DIVESTITURE OF THE LOWER MARGIN PEOPLESERVE BUSINESS, WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION INSURANCE SAVINGS REALIZED IN  Q1 2018 WITH NO CO  RRESPONDING CREDIT IN Q1 2019, AND MIX WITHIN THE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH.  OPERATING EXPENSES  OPERATING EXPENSES FOR Q1 2019 WERE $11,368, A DECREASE OF 5.2% OVER $11,986 FOR Q1 2018.  THE ACQUISITIONS OF CLEMENT MAY, AND KRI DROVE AN ADDITIONAL INCREASE OF 9.5% IN OPERATING EXPENSE.  EXCLUDING THE ACQUISITIONS, OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED BY 14.7% DRIVEN BY LOWER NON-RECURRING COSTS, LEGAL, AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS, LOWER VARIABLE COSTS AND SAVINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SYNERGIES WITHIN THE SUBSIDIARIES, COST SAVINGS INITIATIVES, AND PEOPLESERVE DIVESTURE.  OTHER EXPENSES  OTHER EXPENSES FOR Q1 2019 WAS $523, A DECREASE OF 26.8% FROM $714 IN Q1 2018. THE DECREASE IS DRIVEN BY THE FOLLOWING: $105 LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE RECORDED IN Q1 2019 VERSUS Q1 2018 DUE TO THE $13 MILLION DEBT CONVERSION IN Q3 2018; $847 GAIN ON SETTLEMENT OF FIRSTPRO DEFERRED CONSIDERATION IN Q1 2019; $36 HIGHER OTHER INCOME DRIVEN MAINLY BY HIGHER INVESTMENT INCOME ON THE COMPANY\u2019S WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION COLLATERAL.  THESE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GAIN OF $538 FROM FAIR VALUING WARRANTS IN Q1 2018, WITH NO CORRESPONDING GAIN IN Q1 2019; $224 OF LOWER GAIN IN Q1 2019 VERSUS Q1 2018 FROM REMEASURING THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERCOMPANY NOTE; $35 OF HIGHER AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AND DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS.  18  STAFFING 360 SOLUTIONS, INC.

WE BELIEVE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KPIS MAY PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION FOR EVALUATING OUR CASH OPERATING PERFORMANCE, ABILITY TO SERVICE DEBT, COMPLIANCE WITH DEBT COVENANTS AND MEASUREMENT AGAINST COMPETITORS. THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPLEMENTAL IN NATURE AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. IN ADDITION, THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY ENTITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  WE PRESENT THE FOLLOWING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND KPIS IN THIS REPORT.  REVENUE AND GROSS PROFIT BY SECTOR  WE USE THIS KPI TO MEASURE THE COMPANY\u2019S MIX OF REVENUE AND RESPECTIVE PROFITABILITY BETWEEN ITS TWO MAIN LINES OF BUSINESS DUE TO THEIR DIFFERING MARGINS. FOR CLARITY, THESE LINES OF BUSINESS ARE NOT THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING SEGMENTS, AS THIS INFORMATION IS NOT CURRENTLY REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER TO ALLOCATE CAPITAL AND RESOURCES.

WE USE THIS KPI BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT PROVIDES A MEASURE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFICIENCY FOR CONVERTING INCREMENTAL GROSS PROFIT INTO ADJUSTED EBITDA.

BECAUSE MUCH OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TEMPORARY PAYROLL EXPENSE IS PAID WEEKLY AND IN ADVANCE OF CLIENTS REMITTING PAYMENT FOR INVOICES, OPERATING CASH FLOW IS OFTEN WEAKER IN STAFFING COMPANIES WHERE REVENUE AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE GROWING.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FINANCING IS ESSENTIALLY AN ADVANCE ON CLIENT REMITTANCES AND IS PRIMARILY USED TO FUND TEMPORARY PAYROLL.  AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE THIS MEASURE IS HELPFUL TO INVESTORS AS AN INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY\u2019S UNDERLYING OPERATING CASH FLOW.

NOT ALL OF THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS OR ESTIMATES.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE  FOLLOWING IS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND IS PROVIDED AS A  SUPPLEMENT TO THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO HELP PROVIDE AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION,  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS DURING THE PERIODS INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN  THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, \u201cCOMPANY,\u201d \u201cTHE COMPANY,\u201d \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cUS,\u201d AND  \u201cOUR\u201d REFER TO GREEN ENVIROTECH HOLDINGS CORP., A DELAWARE CORPORATION, UNLESS THE CONTEXT REQUIRES OTHERWISE.  WE  INTEND THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION TO ASSIST IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018. YOU SHOULD REFER TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES IN CONJUNCTION  WITH THIS DISCUSSION.  CORPORATE  HISTORY  ON  NOVEMBER 20, 2009, THE COMPANY, FORMERLY KNOWN AS WOLFE CREEK MINING, INC., ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (THE  \u201cMERGER AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH GREEN ENVIROTECH ACQUISITION CORP., A NEVADA CORPORATION, AND GREEN ENVIROTECH CORP. ON JULY  20, 2010, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS NAME TO GREEN ENVIROTECH HOLDINGS CORP.  OVERVIEW  OF OUR BUSINESS  GREEN  ENVIROTECH HOLDING CORP. (OTC:PINK:GETH) IS FIRST AND FOREMOST A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY. OUR MISSION IS TO FIND, DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT  PRACTICAL, ECONOMICAL SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION OF WASTE, ENERGY, WATER AND FOOD;  AND TO CREATE JOBS AND STIMULATE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHERE WE OPERATE AS WE STRIVE TO ACHIEVE THIS MISSION.  OUR  FIRST MARKET WILL BE TO PROCESS END OF LIFE TIRES, STARTING IN THE USA. OUR GEN 1 END OF LIFE TIRE PROCESSING SOLUTION IS READY  FOR DEPLOYMENT AND WE ARE WORKING TO SECURE OUR FIRST PROJECT FINANCE FACILITY THAT WILL BE USED TO BUILD A CARBON FINISHING PLANT  (CFP) AND BUILD TWO, GEN 1 END OF LIFE TIRE PROCESSING PLANTS. WHETHER OR NOT THE CFP WILL BE A STANDALONE FACILITY OR COMBINED  WITH GEN 1 END OF LIFE TIRE PROCESSING PLANT IS STILL TO BE DETERMINED. WHEN FULLY OPERATIONAL, WE EXPECT THESE PLANTS TO PROCESS  100,000 TONS PER YEAR OF END OF LIFE TIRES AND GENERATE MORE THAN $40 MILLION OF ANNUAL REVENUE.  18  OUR  GOAL OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS (BY 2024) IS TO BE PROCESSING 15-20% OF THE END OF LIFE TIRE FEEDSTOCK IN THE USA, WHICH WOULD GENERATE  MORE THAN $200 MILLION IN ANNUAL REVENUES, MAKING GETH THE MARKET LEADER IN THE USA. IN ORDER TO KEEP UP WITH OUR FIVE YEAR BUILDING  PROGRAM, WE EXPECT TO BE COMMISSIONING NUMEROUS TIRE PROCESSING PLANTS IN A NUMBER OF STRATEGIC LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  WITH OUR EXPANSION PROGRAM, WE INTEND TO CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL FINISHING LINES AT OUR CARBON FINISHING PLANT, WHICH IS TO BE DETERMINED.  ACHIEVING OUR GOAL WOULD MEAN THAT OVER 800,000 TONS OF END-OF-LIFE TIRES WILL BE DIVERTED FROM LANDFILLS. WE SEE OUR EXPANSION  PROGRAM CREATING HUNDREDS OF JOBS, OFTEN IN AREAS OF LOW EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY.  RECENT  DEVELOPMENTS  OVER  THE LAST YEAR AND THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019, WE HAVE BEEN PUSHING THROUGH THE SLOWED PROGRESS WHICH WAS A RESULT OF STALLED  FUNDING WE INCURRED IN 2017 AND 2018. OUR FOCUS IS TO SECURE FUNDING TO BUILD THE CARBON FINISHING PLANT AND A TIRE PROCESSING  PLANT OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH AS ONE UNIT. THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE PROGRESSING GOING FORWARD, BUT WE HAVE NOT SIGNED A DEFINITIVE  AGREEMENT TO FINANCE A PROCESSING PLANT TO DATE. AS A RESULT, THE EXECUTION OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN HAS SLIPPED BY SEVERAL MONTHS,  AND WE NOW FORECAST THE CARBON FINISHING PLANT, FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019, WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN AN INVESTMENT MODE FOR WHICH  WE ANTICIPATE THESE INVESTMENTS TO GENERATE REVENUES STARTING IN LATE 2019 AND/OR INTO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. THE GOAL IS  TO REACH OUR FORECASTED REVENUE OF $1 MILLION TO $2 MILLION IN 2020, AND AN ESTIMATED $15 MILLION IN RECURRING REVENUES FROM 2021  ONWARDS.  MANAGEMENT  INTENDS TO FINANCE OPERATING COSTS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS WITH CREDIT LINES, LOANS AND/OR PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF COMMON STOCK.  ON  MARCH 27, 2018, OUR CEO, SECRETARY AND TREASURER AND FOUR MANAGERS, AGREED TO WAIVE PAYMENT OF THEIR ACCRUED SALARIES THAT WERE  OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WHICH WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CONTRIBUTION TO EQUITY.  ON  MARCH 8, 2018, WE FILED WITH THE STATE OF DELAWARE, DIVISION OF CORPORATIONS, A CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS OF PREFERENCES, RIGHTS  AND LIMITATIONS FOR 300,000 SHARES OF A SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK. THESE SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES ARE  SENIOR TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS IN REFERENCE TO LIQUIDATION DIVIDENDS AND ARE JUNIOR TO THE SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES.  THE SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES HAVE AN ANNUAL 12% DIVIDEND AND HAVE NO VOTING RIGHTS. THE REDEMPTION OPTIONS FOR THESE  SHARES ARE 105% FOR THE FIRST 30 DAYS, 110% FOR THE FIRST 60 DAYS, 115% FOR THE FIRST 90 DAYS, 120% FOR THE FIRST 120 DAYS, 125%  FOR THE FIRST 150 DAYS AND 130% FOR THE FIRST 180 DAYS, THEN AFTER NO REDEMPTION RIGHTS. TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE ISSUE DATE, THE  COMPANY HAS A \u201cMANDATORY REDEMPTION DATE\u201d TO REDEEM THE OUTSTANDING SHARES NOT CONVERTED. THE SHARES HAVE CONVERSION  RIGHTS TO CONVERT AT 75% OF THE AVERAGE OF THE TWO LOWEST COMMON STOCK PRICES TEN DAYS BEFORE THE DATE OF CONVERSION. AS OF THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD 47,300 SHARES OF OUT SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OUTSTANDING. THESE SHARES  WERE ADDED BACK TO THE TREASURY ON APRIL 16, 2019 WHEN THE COMPANY BOUGHT THEM BACK.  ON  OCTOBER 10, 2018, THE COMPANY HELD A MEETING WITH SHAREHOLDERS CONCERNING ITS PROXY STATEMENT REQUESTING SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 APPROVAL  TO EXTEND THE AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES OF THE COMPANY FROM 250,000,000 TO 750,000,000. IT WAS APPROVED. THE COMPANY AT THE TIME  OF THE APPROVAL HAD OUTSTANDING 48,609,224 COMMON SHARES AND NEEDED APPROVAL FROM 24,304,613 SHAREHOLDERS TO PROCEED. THE PROXY  STATEMENT WAS APPROVED BY THE SHAREHOLDERS AND THE CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT WAS STAMPED APPROVED BY THE STATE OF DELAWARE ON OCTOBER  12, 2018.  ON  JANUARY 24, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD VOTED ON AND APPROVED WHAT IT HAD DETERMINED TO BE ITS PRESENT OUTSTANDING STOCK CONDITION  IN THE MARKET. THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK WAS MOVING AT SUCH A CONVERSION SPEED BY CERTAIN NOTE HOLDERS TO THE POINT THE COMPANY  WAS GOING TO BE UNABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE RESERVE SHARES REQUIREMENT FROM ITS UNISSUED SHARES. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL  RESOURCES TO REPAY THE NOTE HOLDERS AT THIS TIME NOR ENOUGH TIME TO FACILITATE NEW FUNDING TO STOP THE CONVERSIONS WHICH CONTINUES  TO LOWER THE PRICE OF THE STOCK IN THE MARKET WHICH INCREASES THE RESERVES NEEDED TO SUPPLY THE CONVERSIONS. THE COMPANY\u2019S  750,000,000 AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES WOULD BE CONSUMED RAPIDLY IF SOMETHING IS NOT ACCOMPLISHED. THEREFORE, IT WAS IN THE CONSENSUS  OF THE BOARD TO RECOMMEND THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS AUTHORIZE A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT TO INCREASE THE PRICE OF THE STOCK IN THE MARKET  AND TO REDUCE THE SHARES OUTSTANDING. ACCORDINGLY, THE BOARD RECOMMENDED THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS ACT TO AUTHORIZE THE BOARD TO EFFECT  A REVERSE SPLIT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK IN ANY AMOUNT UP TO 200 TO ONE AT ANY TIME WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE DATE OF  THIS AUTHORIZATION, AT THE BOARD\u2019S DISCRETION. THE COMPANY\u2019S SHAREHOLDERS, ACTING BY MAJORITY WRITTEN CONSENT, ACTED  ON JANUARY 24, 2019, TO AUTHORIZE THE BOARD TO IMPLEMENT THE REVERSE SPLIT ON THOSE TERMS. PRESENTLY, THE BOARD HAS NOT VOTED ON WHEN THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT WILL TAKE PLACE, NOR HAS THE COMPANY FILED  A PRELIMINARY 14C WITH THE SEC.  19  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICY AND ESTIMATES  OUR  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION DISCUSSES OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION,  ACCRUED EXPENSES, FINANCING OPERATIONS, AND CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL  EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM  THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.

IN 2018, WE STARTED MARKETING OUR DERMAPACE SYSTEM FOR SALE IN THE  UNITED STATES AND WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM SALES OF  THE EUROPEAN CONFORMITY MARKING (CE MARK) DEVICES AND ACCESSORIES  IN EUROPE, CANADA, ASIA AND ASIA/PACIFIC.  OUR  LEAD PRODUCT CANDIDATE FOR THE GLOBAL WOUND CARE MARKET, DERMAPACE,  HAS RECEIVED FDA CLEARANCE FOR COMMERCIAL USE TO TREAT DIABETIC  FOOT ULCERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE CE MARK ALLOWING FOR  COMMERCIAL USE ON ACUTE AND CHRONIC DEFECTS OF THE SKIN AND  SUBCUTANEOUS SOFT TISSUE. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT OUR  PATENTED TECHNOLOGY IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE IN STIMULATING HEALING IN  CHRONIC CONDITIONS OF THE FOOT AND THE ELBOW THROUGH OUR UNITED  STATES FDA CLASS III PMA APPROVED OSSATRON  \u00ae  DEVICE, AND IN  THE STIMULATION OF BONE AND CHRONIC TENDONITIS REGENERATION IN THE  MUSCULOSKELETAL ENVIRONMENT THROUGH THE UTILIZATION OF OUR  ORTHOPACE  \u00ae  , OSSATRON, AND  EVOTRON  \u00ae  DEVICES IN  EUROPE AND ASIA.  WE  ARE FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING OUR PULSED ACOUSTIC CELLULAR EXPRESSION  (PACE) TECHNOLOGY TO ACTIVATE HEALING IN.  \u25cf  WOUND  CONDITIONS, INCLUDING DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS, VENOUS AND ARTERIAL  ULCERS, PRESSURE SORES, BURNS AND OTHER SKIN ERUPTION  CONDITIONS;  \u25cf  ORTHOPEDIC  APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS ELIMINATING CHRONIC PAIN IN JOINTS FROM  TRAUMA, ARTHRITIS OR TENDONS/LIGAMENTS INFLAMMATION, SPEEDING THE  HEALING OF FRACTURES (INCLUDING NONUNION OR DELAYED-UNION  CONDITIONS), IMPROVING BONE DENSITY IN OSTEOPOROSIS, FUSING BONES  IN THE EXTREMITIES AND SPINE, AND OTHER POTENTIAL SPORTS INJURY  APPLICATIONS;  \u25cf  PLASTIC/COSMETIC  APPLICATIONS SUCH AS CELLULITE SMOOTHING, GRAFT AND TRANSPLANT  ACCEPTANCE, SKIN TIGHTENING, SCARRING AND OTHER POTENTIAL AESTHETIC  USES; AND  \u25cf  CARDIAC  APPLICATIONS FOR REMOVING PLAQUE DUE TO ATHEROSCLEROSIS IMPROVING  HEART MUSCLE PERFORMANCE.  IN  ADDITION TO HEALTHCARE USES, OUR HIGH-ENERGY, ACOUSTIC PRESSURE  SHOCK WAVES, DUE TO THEIR POWERFUL PRESSURE GRADIENTS AND LOCALIZED  CAVITATIONAL EFFECTS, MAY HAVE APPLICATIONS IN SECONDARY AND  TERTIARY OIL EXPLOITATION, FOR CLEANING INDUSTRIAL WATERS AND FOOD  LIQUIDS AND FINALLY FOR MAINTENANCE OF INDUSTRIAL INSTALLATIONS BY  DISRUPTING BIOFILMS FORMATION. OUR BUSINESS APPROACH WILL BE  THROUGH LICENSING AND/OR PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES.  19  CLINICAL TRIALS AND MARKETING  THE FDA  GRANTED APPROVAL OF OUR INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE EXEMPTION (IDE) TO  CONDUCT TWO DOUBLE-BLINDED, RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS UTILIZING  OUR LEAD DEVICE PRODUCT FOR THE GLOBAL WOUND CARE MARKET, THE  DERMAPACE DEVICE, IN THE TREATMENT OF DIABETIC FOOT  ULCERS.  THE  DERMAPACE SYSTEM WAS EVALUATED USING TWO STUDIES UNDER IDE G070103.  THE STUDIES WERE DESIGNED AS PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND,  PARALLEL-GROUP, SHAM-CONTROLLED, MULTI-CENTER 24-WEEK STUDIES AT 39  CENTERS. A TOTAL OF 336 SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED AND TREATED WITH  EITHER DERMAPACE PLUS CONVENTIONAL THERAPY OR CONVENTIONAL THERAPY  (A.K.A. STANDARD OF CARE) ALONE. CONVENTIONAL THERAPY INCLUDED, BUT  WAS NOT LIMITED TO, DEBRIDEMENT, SALINE-MOISTENED GAUZE, AND  PRESSURE REDUCING FOOTWEAR. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDIES WAS TO  COMPARE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE DERMAPACE DEVICE TO  SHAM-CONTROL APPLICATION. THE PROSPECTIVELY DEFINED PRIMARY  EFFICACY ENDPOINT FOR THE DERMAPACE STUDIES WAS THE INCIDENCE OF  COMPLETE WOUND CLOSURE AT 12 WEEKS POST-INITIAL APPLICATION OF THE  DERMAPACE SYSTEM (ACTIVE OR SHAM). COMPLETE WOUND CLOSURE WAS  DEFINED AS SKIN RE-EPITHELIALIZATION WITHOUT DRAINAGE OR DRESSING  REQUIREMENTS, CONFIRMED OVER TWO CONSECUTIVE VISITS WITHIN  12-WEEKS. IF THE WOUND WAS CONSIDERED CLOSED FOR THE FIRST TIME AT  THE 12 WEEK VISIT, THEN THE NEXT VISIT WAS USED TO CONFIRM CLOSURE.  INVESTIGATORS CONTINUED TO FOLLOW SUBJECTS AND EVALUATE WOUND  CLOSURE THROUGH 24 WEEKS.  THE DERMAPACE DEVICE COMPLETED ITS INITIAL PHASE  III, IDE CLINICAL TRIAL IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE TREATMENT OF  DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS IN 2011 AND A PMA APPLICATION WAS FILED WITH  THE FDA IN JULY 2011.  THE PATIENT ENROLLMENT FOR THE SECOND,  SUPPLEMENTAL CLINICAL TRIAL BEGAN IN JUNE 2013. WE COMPLETED  ENROLLMENT FOR THE 130 PATIENTS IN THIS SECOND TRIAL IN NOVEMBER  2014 AND SUSPENDED FURTHER ENROLLMENT AT THAT TIME.  THE  ONLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO STUDIES WAS THE NUMBER  OF APPLICATIONS OF THE DERMAPACE DEVICE. STUDY ONE (DERM01; N=206)  PRESCRIBED FOUR (4) DEVICE APPLICATIONS/TREATMENTS OVER A TWO-WEEK  PERIOD, WHEREAS, STUDY TWO (DERM02; N=130) PRESCRIBED UP TO EIGHT  (8) DEVICE APPLICATIONS (4 WITHIN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF  RANDOMIZATION, AND 1 TREATMENT EVERY TWO WEEKS THEREAFTER UP TO A  TOTAL OF 8 TREATMENTS OVER A 10-WEEK PERIOD). IF THE WOUND WAS  DETERMINED CLOSED BY THE PI DURING THE TREATMENT REGIMEN, ANY  FURTHER PLANNED APPLICATIONS WERE NOT PERFORMED.  BETWEEN  THE TWO STUDIES THERE WERE OVER 336 PATIENTS EVALUATED, WITH 172  PATIENTS TREATED WITH DERMAPACE AND 164 CONTROL GROUP SUBJECTS WITH  USE OF A NON-FUNCTIONAL DEVICE (SHAM). BOTH TREATMENT GROUPS  RECEIVED WOUND CARE CONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARD OF CARE IN  ADDITION TO DEVICE APPLICATION. STUDY SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED USING  PRE-DETERMINED INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A  HOMOGENOUS STUDY POPULATION WITH CHRONIC DIABETES AND A DIABETIC  FOOT ULCER THAT HAS PERSISTED A MINIMUM OF 30 DAYS AND ITS AREA IS  BETWEEN 1CM  2  AND 16CM  2  , INCLUSIVE. SUBJECTS  WERE ENROLLED AT VISIT 1 AND FOLLOWED FOR A RUN-IN PERIOD OF TWO  WEEKS. AT TWO WEEKS (VISIT 2 \u2013 DAY 0), THE FIRST TREATMENT  WAS APPLIED (EITHER DERMAPACE OR SHAM CONTROL APPLICATION).  APPLICATIONS WITH EITHER DERMAPACE OR SHAM CONTROL WERE THEN MADE  AT DAY 3 (VISIT 3), DAY 6 (VISIT 4), AND DAY 9 (VISIT 5) WITH THE  POTENTIAL FOR 4 ADDITIONAL TREATMENTS IN STUDY 2. SUBJECT PROGRESS  INCLUDING WOUND SIZE WAS THEN OBSERVED ON A BI-WEEKLY BASIS FOR UP  TO 24 WEEKS AT A TOTAL OF 12 VISITS (WEEKS 2-24; VISITS  6-17).  A TOTAL  OF 336 PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED IN THE DERMAPACE STUDIES AT 37 SITES.  THE PATIENTS IN THE STUDIES WERE FOLLOWED FOR A TOTAL OF 24 WEEKS.  THE STUDIES\u2019 PRIMARY ENDPOINT, WOUND CLOSURE, WAS DEFINED AS  \u201cSUCCESSFUL\u201d IF THE SKIN WAS 100% RE-EPITHELIALIZED AT  12 WEEKS WITHOUT DRAINAGE OR DRESSING REQUIREMENTS CONFIRMED AT TWO  CONSECUTIVE STUDY VISITS.  A  SUMMARY OF THE KEY STUDY FINDINGS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  \u25cf  PATIENTS TREATED  WITH DERMAPACE SHOWED A STRONG POSITIVE TREND IN THE PRIMARY  ENDPOINT OF 100% WOUND CLOSURE. TREATMENT WITH DERMAPACE INCREASED  THE PROPORTION OF DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS THAT CLOSED WITHIN 12 WEEKS,  ALTHOUGH THE RATE OF COMPLETE WOUND CLOSURE BETWEEN DERMAPACE AND  SHAM-CONTROL AT 12 WEEKS IN THE INTENTION-TO-TREAT (ITT) POPULATION  WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AT THE 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL USED  THROUGHOUT THE STUDY (P=0.320). THERE WERE 39 OUT OF 172 (22.67%)  DERMAPACE SUBJECTS WHO ACHIEVED COMPLETE WOUND CLOSURE AT 12 WEEKS  COMPARED WITH 30 OUT OF 164 (18.29%) SHAM-CONTROL  SUBJECTS.  \u25cf  IN ADDITION TO THE  ORIGINALLY PROPOSED 12-WEEK EFFICACY ANALYSIS, AND IN CONJUNCTION  WITH THE FDA AGREEMENT TO ANALYZE THE EFFICACY ANALYSIS CARRIED  OVER THE FULL 24 WEEKS OF THE STUDY, WE CONDUCTED A SERIES OF  SECONDARY ANALYSES OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT OF COMPLETE WOUND  CLOSURE AT 12 WEEKS AND AT EACH SUBSEQUENT STUDY VISIT OUT TO 24  WEEKS. THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT OF COMPLETE WOUND CLOSURE  REACHED STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE AT 20 WEEKS IN THE ITT POPULATION  WITH 61 (35.47%) DERMAPACE SUBJECTS ACHIEVING COMPLETE WOUND  CLOSURE COMPARED WITH 40 (24.39%) OF SHAM-CONTROL SUBJECTS  (P=0.027). AT THE 24 WEEK ENDPOINT, THE RATE OF WOUND CLOSURE IN  THE DERMAPACE\u00ae COHORT WAS 37.8% COMPARED TO 26.2% FOR THE  CONTROL GROUP, RESULTING IN A P-VALUE OF 0.023.  20  \u25cf  WITHIN 6 WEEKS  FOLLOWING THE INITIAL DERMAPACE TREATMENT, AND CONSISTENTLY  THROUGHOUT THE 24-WEEK PERIOD, DERMAPACE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE  SIZE OF THE TARGET ULCER COMPARED WITH SUBJECTS RANDOMIZED TO  RECEIVE SHAM-CONTROL (P<0.05).  \u25cf  THE PROPORTION OF  PATIENTS WITH WOUND CLOSURE INDICATE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DERMAPACE AND THE CONTROL GROUP IN THE  PROPORTION OF SUBJECTS WITH THE TARGET-ULCER NOT CLOSED OVER THE  COURSE OF THE STUDY (P-VALUE=0.0346). APPROXIMATELY 25% OF  DERMAPACE\u00ae SUBJECTS REACHED WOUND CLOSURE PER THE STUDY  DEFINITION BY DAY 84 (WEEK 12). THE SAME PERCENTAGE IN THE CONTROL  GROUP (25%) DID NOT REACH WOUND CLOSURE UNTIL DAY 112 (WEEK 16).  THESE DATA INDICATE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE PROPORTION OF SUBJECTS  REACHING WOUND CLOSURE BEING HIGHER IN THE DERMAPACE\u00ae GROUP,  SUBJECTS ARE ALSO REACHING WOUND CLOSURE AT A FASTER RATE WHEN  DERMAPACE IS APPLIED.  \u25cf  DERMAPACE  DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR RESULTS IN THE PREVENTION OF WOUND EXPANSION  (\u2265 10% INCREASE IN WOUND SIZE), WHEN COMPARED TO THE CONTROL,  OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY AT 12 WEEKS (18.0% VERSUS 31.1%;  P=0.005, RESPECTIVELY).  \u25cf  AT 12 AND 24 WEEKS,  THE DERMAPACE GROUP HAD A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF SUBJECTS WITH A 50%  WOUND REDUCTION COMPARED TO THE CONTROL (P=0.0554 AND P=0.0899,  RESPECTIVELY). BOTH TIME POINTS DEMONSTRATE A TREND TOWARDS  STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE.  \u25cf  THE MEAN WOUND  REDUCTION FOR DERMAPACE SUBJECTS AT 24 WEEKS WAS 2.10CM2 COMPARED  TO 0.83CM2 IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY  SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WOUND AREA REDUCTIONS OF THE TWO  COHORTS FROM THE 6 WEEK FOLLOW-UP VISIT THROUGH THE END OF THE  STUDY.  \u25cf  OF THE SUBJECTS WHO  ACHIEVED COMPLETE WOUND CLOSURE AT 12 WEEKS, THE RECURRENCE RATE AT  24 WEEKS WAS ONLY 7.7% IN THE DERMAPACE GROUP COMPARED WITH 11.6%  IN THE SHAM-CONTROL GROUP.  \u25cf  IMPORTANTLY, THERE  WERE NO MEANINGFUL STATISTICAL DIFFERENCES IN THE ADVERSE EVENT  RATES BETWEEN THE DERMAPACE TREATED PATIENTS AND THE SHAM-CONTROL  GROUP. THERE WERE NO ISSUES REGARDING THE TOLERABILITY OF THE  TREATMENT WHICH SUGGESTS THAT A SECOND COURSE OF TREATMENT, IF  NEEDED, IS A CLINICALLY VIABLE OPTION.  WE  RETAINED MUSCULOSKELETAL CLINICAL REGULATORY ADVISERS, LLC (MCRA)  IN JANUARY 2015 TO LEAD THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERACTIONS AND  CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE FDA FOR THE DERMAPACE, WHICH HAVE ALREADY  COMMENCED. MCRA HAS SUCCESSFULLY WORKED WITH THE FDA ON NUMEROUS  PREMARKET APPROVALS (PMAS) FOR VARIOUS MUSCULOSKELETAL, RESTORATIVE  AND GENERAL SURGICAL DEVICES SINCE 2006.  WORKING  WITH MCRA, WE SUBMITTED TO FDA A  DE NOVO  PETITION ON JULY 23, 2016. DUE  TO THE STRONG SAFETY PROFILE OF OUR DEVICE AND THE EFFICACY OF THE  DATA SHOWING STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR WOUND CLOSURE FOR  DERMAPACE SUBJECTS AT 20 WEEKS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE DERMAPACE  DEVICE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR CLASSIFICATION INTO CLASS II AS  THERE IS NO LEGALLY MARKETED PREDICATE DEVICE AND THERE IS NOT AN  EXISTING CLASS III CLASSIFICATION REGULATION OR ONE OR MORE  APPROVED PMAS (WHICH WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A RECLASSIFICATION UNDER  SECTION 513(E) OR (F)(3) OF THE FD&C ACT). ON DECEMBER 28,  2017, THE FDA DETERMINED THAT THE CRITERIA AT SECTION 513(A)(1)(A)  OF (B) OF THE FD&C ACT WERE MET AND GRANTED THE  DE NOVO  CLEARANCE CLASSIFYING DERMAPACE  AS CLASS II AND AVAILABLE TO BE MARKETED IMMEDIATELY.  FINALLY, OUR  DERMAPACE DEVICE HAS RECEIVED THE EUROPEAN CE MARK APPROVAL TO  TREAT ACUTE AND CHRONIC DEFECTS OF THE SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS SOFT  TISSUE, SUCH AS IN THE TREATMENT OF PRESSURE ULCERS, DIABETIC FOOT  ULCERS, BURNS, AND TRAUMATIC AND SURGICAL WOUNDS. THE DERMAPACE IS  ALSO LICENSED FOR SALE IN CANADA, AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND AND SOUTH  KOREA.  WE ARE  ACTIVELY MARKETING THE DERMAPACE TO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, CANADA  AND ASIA/PACIFIC, UTILIZING DISTRIBUTORS IN SELECT  COUNTRIES.  CLINICAL STUDIES  A  DOSAGE STUDY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED FOR LAUNCH IN POLAND TO OPTIMIZE  DERMAPACE SYSTEM TREATMENT DOSAGE FOR PRODUCING A MORE RAPID  REDUCTION IN SIZE OF A DIABETIC FOOT ULCER  (\u201cDFU\u201d).  THE FOCUS WILL BE ON INCREASING THE  NUMBER OF SHOCK WAVES DELIVERED PER TREATMENT, AS A FUNCTION OF  DFUS AREA.  TO DETERMINE THE DOSAGE NECESSARY, THREE NEW  DISTINCTIVE REGIMENS WILL BE ASSESSED DURING THE STUDY.  THIS  STUDY STARTED IN APRIL 2019 AND IS EXPECTED TO BE FINALIZED LATE IN  THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019.  A  POST-MARKET PILOT STUDY TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF HIGH ENERGY  ACOUSTIC SHOCK WAVE THERAPY ON LOCAL SKIN PERFUSION AND HEALING OF  DFUS WILL BE CONDUCTED AT TWO SITES: ONE IN NEW JERSEY AND ONE IN  CALIFORNIA. THE INTENT OF THIS TRIAL IS TO QUANTIFY THE LEVEL OF  INCREASED PERFUSION AND OXYGENATION DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT WITH  THE DERMAPACE SYSTEM. ENROLLMENT AND FIRST PATIENT TREATMENT  STARTED IN APRIL 2019.  21  FINANCIAL OVERVIEW  SINCE  OUR INCEPTION, WE HAVE INCURRED LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS EACH YEAR.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF  $117,520,434. ALTHOUGH THE SIZE AND TIMING OF OUR FUTURE OPERATING  LOSSES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY, WE ANTICIPATE THAT  OUR OPERATING LOSSES WILL CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS WE  INCUR EXPENSES RELATED TO COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR DERMAPACE SYSTEM  FOR THE TREATMENT OF DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS IN THE UNITED STATES. IF  WE ARE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZE, MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE  THE DERMAPACE SYSTEM, WE HOPE TO PARTIALLY OR COMPLETELY OFFSET  THESE LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.  OUR  OPERATING LOSSES CREATE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO  CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. ALTHOUGH NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN,  WE BELIEVE THAT POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES OF EQUITY, DEBT OR  OTHER POTENTIAL FINANCING WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FUNDING FOR US  TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN FOR THE NEXT YEAR. SEE  \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d FOR FURTHER  INFORMATION REGARDING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  WE  CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE NATURE, TIMING AND COSTS OF THE  EFFORTS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL OF, OR  THE PERIOD IN WHICH MATERIAL NET CASH FLOWS ARE EXPECTED TO BE  GENERATED FROM, ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS, DUE TO THE NUMEROUS RISKS AND  UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPING AND MARKETING PRODUCTS,  INCLUDING THE UNCERTAINTY OF.  \u25cf  THE SCOPE, RATE OF  PROGRESS AND COST OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS;  \u25cf  FUTURE CLINICAL  TRIAL RESULTS;  \u25cf  THE COST AND TIMING  OF REGULATORY APPROVALS;  \u25cf  THE ESTABLISHMENT  OF SUCCESSFUL MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND  PARTNERSHIPS, INCLUDING OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND OUR MARKETING, SALES  AND DISTRIBUTION REACH THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL  ARRANGEMENTS;  \u25cf  THE COST AND TIMING  ASSOCIATED WITH ESTABLISHING REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR  PRODUCTS;  \u25cf  THE EFFECTS OF  COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS; AND  \u25cf  THE INDUSTRY DEMAND  AND PATIENT WELLNESS BEHAVIOR.  ANY  FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES IN A  TIMELY MANNER, OR ANY FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY MARKET AND  COMMERCIALIZE OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES, WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE  EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY. A  DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH US AND  OUR BUSINESS ARE SET FORTH UNDER THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cRISK  FACTORS \u2013 RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\u201d IN OUR ANNUAL  REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, FILED  WITH THE SEC ON APRIL 1, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS ARE BASED ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNITED  STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE PREPARATION OF  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE  ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF  ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES.  ON AN ONGOING  BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE  RELATED TO THE RECORDING OF THE ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS,  ESTIMATED RESERVES FOR INVENTORY, ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF PROPERTY  AND EQUIPMENT, THE DETERMINATION OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR  DEFERRED TAXES, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE WARRANT LIABILITY,  AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. WE BASE  OUR ESTIMATES ON AUTHORITATIVE LITERATURE AND PRONOUNCEMENTS,  HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE  BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF  WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUE  OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER  SOURCES. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER  DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS  FOR ANY HISTORICAL PERIOD ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE  RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD.  WHILE  OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 2 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FILED WITH OUR  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018,  FILED WITH THE SEC ON APRIL 1, 2019, WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING  ACCOUNTING POLICIES RELATING TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, LIABILITIES  RELATED TO WARRANTS ISSUED, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ARE  SIGNIFICANT AND; THEREFORE, THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO AID YOU IN FULLY  UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL  RESULTS.  22  REVENUE RECOGNITION  SALES  OF MEDICAL DEVICES, INCLUDING RELATED APPLICATORS AND APPLICATOR  KITS, ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN SHIPPED TO THE CUSTOMER. SHIPMENTS UNDER  AGREEMENTS WITH DISTRIBUTORS ARE INVOICED AT A FIXED PRICE, ARE NOT  SUBJECT TO RETURN, AND PAYMENT FOR THESE SHIPMENTS IS NOT  CONTINGENT ON SALES BY THE DISTRIBUTOR. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES ON  SHIPMENTS TO DISTRIBUTORS IN THE SAME MANNER AS WITH OTHER  CUSTOMERS. THE INITIAL WARRANTY AND EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE SALE  OF MEDICAL DEVICES WILL BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER TIME AS THE  PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED. FEES FROM SERVICES PERFORMED  ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SERVICE IS PERFORMED. LICENSE FEE FOR  REFURBISHMENT OF APPLICATORS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME THE  CUSTOMER IS GRANTED THE LICENSE TO REFURBISH THE APPLICATORS.  REVENUE WILL BE CALCULATED USING THE TRANSACTION PRICE THAT  REPRESENTS THE MOST LIKELY CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED FOR THE  LICENSE TIMES THE NUMBER OF LICENSES ISSUED. FEES FOR UPFRONT  DISTRIBUTION LICENSE AGREEMENTS WILL BE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT  LINE BASIS BASED ON THE PAYMENT SCHEDULE IN THE  CONTRACT.  LIABILITIES RELATED TO WARRANTS ISSUED  WE  RECORD CERTAIN COMMON STOCK WARRANTS WE ISSUED AT FAIR VALUE AND  RECOGNIZE THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH WARRANTS AS A GAIN  OR LOSS, WHICH WE REPORT IN THE OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) SECTION IN  OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS. WE REPORT THESE  WARRANTS AT FAIR VALUE AND THEY ARE CLASSIFIED AS LIABILITIES  BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN CERTAIN DOWN-ROUND PROVISIONS ALLOWING FOR  REDUCTION OF THEIR EXERCISE PRICE. WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF  THESE WARRANTS USING A BINOMIAL OPTIONS PRICING MODEL.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  THE  STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN PROVIDES THAT STOCK OPTIONS, AND OTHER EQUITY  INTERESTS OR EQUITY-BASED INCENTIVES, MAY BE GRANTED TO KEY  PERSONNEL, DIRECTORS AND ADVISORS AT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMMON  STOCK AT THE TIME THE OPTION IS GRANTED, WHICH IS APPROVED BY OUR  BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE MAXIMUM TERM OF ANY OPTION GRANTED PURSUANT  TO THE STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN IS TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF  GRANT.  THE  FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION AWARD IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT  USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE EXPECTED TERMS OF  OPTIONS GRANTED REPRESENT THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT OPTIONS GRANTED  ARE ESTIMATED TO BE OUTSTANDING AND ARE DERIVED FROM THE  CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE OPTIONS GRANTED. WE AMORTIZE THE FAIR  VALUE OF EACH OPTION OVER EACH OPTION\u2019S VESTING  PERIOD.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND  2018  REVENUES AND COST OF REVENUES  REVENUES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WERE $177,963, COMPARED TO  $344,272 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, A DECREASE OF $166,309, OR  48%. REVENUE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM SALES IN EUROPE OF OUR  ORTHOPACE DEVICES AND RELATED APPLICATORS, SALES IN THE UNITED  STATES OF OUR DERMAPACE APPLICATORS AND UPFRONT DISTRIBUTION FEE  FROM OUR SOUTHEAST ASIA DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH JOHNFK MEDICAL  INC. (\"FKS\"). THE DECREASE IN REVENUE FOR 2019 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO  A DECREASE IN SALES OF ORTHOPACE DEVICES IN ASIA/PACIFIC AND THE  EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AS WELL AS LOWER  SALES OF NEW APPLICATORS.  COST OF  REVENUES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WERE $93,853,  COMPARED TO $165,466 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. GROSS PROFIT AS A  PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES WAS 47% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019, COMPARED TO 52% FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE DECREASE IN  GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES IN 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE  TO COST OF NEW AND REFURBISHED DERMAPACE APPLICATORS IN THE UNITED  STATES AS A RESULT OF PLACEMENTS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  INCREASED REVENUE FOR REFURBISHMENT LICENSE AND UPFRONT  DISTRIBUTION FEE WHICH HAVE LITTLE OR NO RELATED COST, AS COMPARED  TO 2018.  23  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  RESEARCH AND  DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WERE  $261,002, COMPARED TO $238,477 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, AN  INCREASE OF $22,525, OR 9%. THE INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND  DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES IN 2019, AS COMPARED TO 2018, WAS DUE TO AN  INCREASE IN CONTRACTING FOR TEMPORARY SERVICES AND INCREASED STUDY  EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR NEW DOSAGE STUDY IN  POLAND.  SELLING AND MARKETING EXPENSES  SELLING  AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  WERE $158,083, COMPARED TO $51,959 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018, AN INCREASE OF $106,124, OR 204%. THE INCREASE IN SALES AND  MARKETING EXPENSES IN 2019, AS COMPARED TO 2018, WAS DUE TO AN  INCREASE IN HIRING OF TRAINERS AND SALESPEOPLE AND INCREASED TRAVEL  EXPENSES FOR PLACEMENT AND TRAINING RELATED TO THE  COMMERCIALIZATION OF DERMAPACE.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  WERE $1,517,101, AS COMPARED TO $1,004,614 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018, AN INCREASE OF $512,487, OR 51%. THE INCREASE IN GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2019, AS COMPARED TO 2018, WAS DUE TO AN  INCREASE IN SALARY, BONUS AND BENEFITS RELATED TO NEW HIRES IN  2018, INCREASED LEGAL COSTS OF ASSOCIATED WITH SEC FILINGS AND  PATENT ISSUANCE AND MAINTENANCE, INCREASED CONSULTING EXPENSES OF  RELATED TO OUR INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENT STRATEGY FOR THE  COMMERCIALIZATION OF DERMAPACE AND ONE-TIME EXPENSE RELATED TO  EMAIL SPOOFING CYBER SECURITY BREACH.  DEPRECIATION  DEPRECIATION FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $8,357, COMPARED TO  $5,016 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, AN INCREASE OF $3,341, OR 67%.  THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE HIGHER DEPRECIATION RELATED TO INCREASE  IN FIXED ASSETS.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  OTHER  INCOME (EXPENSE) WAS A NET EXPENSE OF $336,885 FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO A NET EXPENSE OF  $4,735,395 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, A DECREASE OF  $4,398,510, OR 93%, IN THE NET EXPENSE. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO DECREASED INTEREST EXPENSE, BENEFICIAL CONVERSION DISCOUNT  AND DEBT DISCOUNT RELATED TO THE CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES  ISSUED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017 AND FIRST QUARTER OF 2018. IN  ADDITION, THE NET EXPENSE IN 2019 INCLUDED A NON-CASH GAIN FOR  VALUATION ADJUSTMENT  ON OUTSTANDING WARRANTS OF $32,359, AS COMPARED TO A NON-CASH LOSS  FOR VALUATION ADJUSTMENT ON OUTSTANDING WARRANTS OF $2,973,682 IN  2018.  NET LOSS  NET LOSS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $2,197,317, OR ($0.01) PER  BASIC AND DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $5,856,655, OR  ($0.04) PER BASIC AND DILUTED SHARE, FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, A  DECREASE IN THE NET LOSS OF $3,659,338, OR 62%. THE DECREASE IN THE  NET LOSS WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF A DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME  (EXPENSE), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OUR OPERATING  EXPENSES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE  EXPECT TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES FOR THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF  THE DERMAPACE SYSTEM AND WILL CONTINUE TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOP THE  NON-MEDICAL USES OF THE PACE TECHNOLOGY, BOTH OF WHICH WILL REQUIRE  ADDITIONAL CAPITAL RESOURCES. WE INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $2,197,317  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND $11,631,394 FOR THE  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THESE FACTORS ALONG WITH THE EVENTS  OF DEFAULT ON THE NOTES PAYABLE TO HEALTHTRONICS, INC., THE  COMPANY\u2019S CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES AND THE  COMPANY\u2019S SHORT TERM NOTES PAYABLE CREATE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT  ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN  FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE FINANCIAL ISSUANCE  DATE.  SINCE  INCEPTION IN 2005, OUR OPERATIONS HAVE PRIMARILY BEEN FUNDED FROM  THE SALE OF CAPITAL STOCK AND CONVERTIBLE DEBT  SECURITIES.  WE HAVE  ENTERED INTO SHORT TERM NOTES PAYABLE WITH TWENTY-FOUR INDIVIDUALS  BETWEEN JUNE 26, 2018 AND MARCH 13, 2019 IN THE TOTAL PRINCIPAL  AMOUNT OF $2,835,525 WITH AN INTEREST RATE OF 5% PER ANNUM. THE  PRINCIPAL AND ACCRUED INTEREST ARE DUE AND PAYABLE SIX MONTHS FROM  THE DATE OF ISSUANCE OR RECEIPT OF NOTICE OF WARRANT EXERCISE. ON  DECEMBER 26, 2018, THE COMPANY DEFAULTED ON THE SHORT TERM NOTES  PAYABLE ISSUED ON JUNE 26, 2018 AND BEGAN ACCRUING INTEREST AT THE  DEFAULT INTEREST RATE OF 10%. ON JANUARY 2, 2019, THE COMPANY  DEFAULTED ON THE SHORT TERM NOTES PAYABLE ISSUED ON JULY 2, 2018  AND BEGAN ACCRUING INTEREST AT THE DEFAULT INTEREST RATE OF 10%. ON  JANUARY 30, 2019, THE COMPANY DEFAULTED ON THE SHORT TERM NOTES  PAYABLE ISSUED ON JULY 30, 2018 AND BEGAN ACCRUING INTEREST AT THE  DEFAULT INTEREST RATE OF 10%.  24  THE CONTINUATION OF OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT UPON  RAISING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FINAL THREE QUARTERS OF 2019 TO  FUND OPERATIONS. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE CASH USED IN OPERATIONS FOR  THE COMPANY WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $225,000 TO $300,000 PER MONTH  FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 AND $275,000 TO $350,000 PER MONTH FOR  THE SECOND HALF OF 2019 AS  RESOURCES ARE DEVOTED TO THE  COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE DERMAPACE PRODUCT INCLUDING HIRING OF NEW  EMPLOYEES, EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND CONTINUED  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NON-MEDICAL USES OF OUR TECHNOLOGY.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLANS ARE TO OBTAIN  ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN 2019 THROUGH INVESTMENTS BY STRATEGIC  PARTNERS FOR MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE STRATEGIC  PARTNERSHIPS OR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS, OR RAISE CAPITAL THROUGH  THE CONVERSION OF OUTSTANDING WARRANTS, ISSUANCE OF COMMON OR  PREFERRED STOCK, SECURITIES CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON STOCK, OR  SECURED OR UNSECURED DEBT. THESE POSSIBILITIES, TO THE EXTENT  AVAILABLE, MAY BE ON TERMS THAT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DILUTION TO  OUR EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES  THAT OUR PLANS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON  THE TERMS OR TIMELINE WE EXPECT, OR AT ALL. A $400,000 FEE WE  ANTICIPATED RECEIVING IN APRIL 2019 FROM FKS UNDER THE TERMS OF A  JUNE 2018 AGREEMENT HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED TO DATE, AND WE ARE IN  NEGOTIATIONS WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTY WITH REPSECT TO PAYMENTS AND  OPERATIONS UNDER SUCH AGREEMENT.  ALTHOUGH NO ASSURANCES CAN  BE GIVEN, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES  OF EQUITY OR OTHER POTENTIAL FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AS DISCUSSED  ABOVE SHOULD PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FUNDING FOR US.  IF THESE EFFORTS ARE UNSUCCESSFUL, WE MAY BE  REQUIRED TO SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL OR DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS OR  OBTAIN FUNDS THROUGH FINANCING TRANSACTIONS WITH UNFAVORABLE  TERMS.  THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES  GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHICH  CONTEMPLATE CONTINUATION OF THE COMPANY AS A GOING CONCERN AND THE  REALIZATION OF ASSETS AND SATISFACTION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL  COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  PRESENTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT NECESSARILY PURPORT TO  REPRESENT REALIZABLE OR SETTLEMENT VALUES. THE CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENT THAT MIGHT  RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS UNCERTAINTY.  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT  INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO THE RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS  AND CLASSIFICATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT BE  NECESSARY SHOULD WE BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING  CONCERN.  IN  ADDITION, WE MAY HAVE POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN SALES, OFFERS  OR ISSUANCES OF EQUITY SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY IN POSSIBLE  VIOLATION OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION  STATEMENT ON FORM S-1 (REGISTRATION NO. 333-208676), DECLARED  EFFECTIVE ON FEBRUARY 16, 2016 (THE \u201c2016 REGISTRATION  STATEMENT\u201d), THE COMPANY SOUGHT TO REGISTER: A PRIMARY  OFFERING OF UP TO $4,000,000 UNITS, THE COMMON STOCK INCLUDED AS  PART OF THE UNITS, THE WARRANTS INCLUDED AS PART OF THE UNITS, AND  THE COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE OF SUCH WARRANTS; A PRIMARY  OFFERING OF UP TO $400,000 PLACEMENT AGENT WARRANTS AND THE COMMON  STOCK ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE OF SUCH PLACEMENT AGENT WARRANTS; AND  A SECONDARY OFFERING OF 23,545,144 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HELD BY  CERTAIN SELLING STOCKHOLDERS NAMED IN THE 2016 REGISTRATION  STATEMENT. THE SEC STAFF\u2019S INTERPRETATIONS PROVIDE THAT, WHEN  AN ISSUER IS REGISTERING UNITS COMPOSED OF COMMON STOCK, COMMON  STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS, AND THE COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE  WARRANTS, THE REGISTRATION FEE IS BASED ON THE OFFER PRICE OF THE  UNITS AND THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE WARRANTS. THE REGISTRATION FEE  PAID DID INCLUDE THE FEE BASED ON THE OFFER PRICE OF THE UNITS,  ALLOCATED TO THE UNIT LINE ITEM IN THE FEE TABLE. ALTHOUGH THE FEE  TABLE IN THE 2016 REGISTRATION STATEMENT INCLUDED A LINE ITEM FOR  THE COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE WARRANTS, THE COMPANY DID NOT  INCLUDE IN THAT LINE ITEM THE FEE PAYABLE BASED ON THE EXERCISE  PRICE OF $0.08 PER SHARE FOR SUCH WARRANTS, WHICH AMOUNT SHOULD  HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO SUCH LINE ITEM BASED ON THE SEC  STAFF\u2019S INTERPRETATIONS. AS A RESULT, A PORTION OF THE  SECURITIES INTENDED TO BE REGISTERED BY THE 2016 REGISTRATION  STATEMENT WAS NOT REGISTERED. IN ADDITION, IN A POST-EFFECTIVE  AMENDMENT TO THE 2016 REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED ON SEPTEMBER 23,  2016, TOO MANY PLACEMENT AGENT WARRANTS WERE INADVERTENTLY  DEREGISTERED. THE POST-EFFECTIVE AMENDMENT STATED THAT THE COMPANY  HAD ISSUED $180,100, BASED ON 2,251,250 CLASS L WARRANTS ISSUED  WITH A $0.08 EXERCISE PRICE OF WARRANTS TO THE PLACEMENT AGENT AND  THEREFORE DEREGISTERED $219,900, BASED ON 2,748,750 CLASS L  WARRANTS ISSUED WITH A $0.08 EXERCISE PRICE OF PLACEMENT AGENT  WARRANTS FROM THE $400,000, BASED ON 5,000,000 CLASS L WARRANTS  ISSUED WITH A $0.08 EXERCISE PRICE TOTAL OFFERING AMOUNT INCLUDED  IN THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT. THE ACTUAL WARRANTS ISSUED TO THE  PLACEMENT AGENT TOTALED $240,133.36, BASED ON 3,001,667 CLASS L  WARRANTS ISSUED WITH A $0.08 EXERCISE PRICE, AND ONLY $159,867,  BASED ON 1,998,338 CLASS L WARRANTS ISSUED WITH A $0.08 EXERCISE  PRICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEREGISTERED IN SUCH POST-EFFECTIVE  AMENDMENT. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE NOT REGISTERED OR FAILED TO  MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF  THE TRANSACTIONS IN SECURITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE AND WITH RESPECT TO  OUR ONGOING OFFERING OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE  WARRANTS, AND A VIOLATION OF SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT DID IN  FACT OCCUR OR IS OCCURRING, ELIGIBLE HOLDERS OF OUR SECURITIES THAT  PARTICIPATED IN THESE OFFERINGS WOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO RESCIND THEIR  TRANSACTIONS, AND THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO REFUND ANY AMOUNTS PAID  FOR THE SECURITIES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON  THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION. ELIGIBLE SECURITYHOLDERS  HAVE NOT FILED A CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF  SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT WITH RESPECT TO THESE TRANSACTIONS,  BUT THEY COULD FILE A CLAIM IN THE FUTURE. FURTHERMORE, THE ONGOING  OFFERING OF AND ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING  CERTAIN OF OUR WARRANTS FROM THE 2016 REGISTRATION STATEMENT MAY  HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 5 OF THE  SECURITIES ACT AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS UNDER THE SECURITIES  ACT, BECAUSE WE DID NOT UPDATE THE PROSPECTUS IN THE 2016  REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THE 2016  REGISTRATION STATEMENT WAS DECLARED EFFECTIVE AND BECAUSE OUR  RELIANCE ON RULE 457(P) UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT IN AN AMENDMENT TO  OUR REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-1 (REGISTRATION NO.  333-213774) FILED ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2016 EFFECTED A DEREGISTRATION  OF THE SECURITIES REGISTERED UNDER THE 2016 REGISTRATION STATEMENT.  ELIGIBLE SECURITYHOLDERS HAVE NOT FILED A CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY  ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT, BUT THEY  COULD FILE SUCH A CLAIM IN THE FUTURE. IF A VIOLATION OF SECTION 5  OF THE SECURITIES ACT DID IN FACT OCCUR OR IS OCCURRING, ELIGIBLE  SECURITYHOLDERS WOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO RESCIND THEIR TRANSACTIONS,  AND THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO REFUND ANY AMOUNTS PAID THE SECURITIES,  WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S  FINANCIAL CONDITION.  25  WE MAY  ALSO ATTEMPT TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IF THERE ARE FAVORABLE  MARKET CONDITIONS OR OTHER STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS EVEN IF WE HAVE  SUFFICIENT FUNDS FOR PLANNED OPERATIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE  RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR  SHAREHOLDERS WILL EXPERIENCE DILUTION AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO USE  SOME OR ALL OF THE NET PROCEEDS TO REPAY OUR INDEBTEDNESS, AND DEBT  FINANCINGS, IF AVAILABLE, MAY INVOLVE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS OR MAY  OTHERWISE CONSTRAIN OUR FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. TO THE EXTENT THAT  WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS, IT  MAY BE NECESSARY TO RELINQUISH SOME RIGHTS TO OUR INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY OR GRANT LICENSES ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT FAVORABLE TO US.  IN ADDITION, PAYMENTS MADE BY POTENTIAL COLLABORATORS OR LICENSORS  GENERALLY WILL DEPEND UPON OUR ACHIEVEMENT OF NEGOTIATED  DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY MILESTONES. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THESE  MILESTONES WOULD HARM OUR FUTURE CAPITAL POSITION.

ACTUAL  RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THE REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS OF ASC 606 AS OF JANUARY  1, 2018.

MANAGEMENT PLANS TO WORK WITH OUR CURRENT LENDERS AND DEBT HOLDERS TO LOWER OUR COST OF BORROWING  BY RENEGOTIATING THE TERMS OF OUR EXISTING DEBT AND POTENTIALLY OFFERING DEBT HOLDERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXCHANGE THEIR DEBT FOR  EQUITY IN THE COMPANY. MANAGEMENT WILL SEEK ADDITIONAL FINANCING IN THOSE INSTANCES IN WHICH WE BELIEVE SUCH ADDITIONAL FINANCINGS  WILL ASSIST IN ACCOMPLISHING OUR GOALS.

THE COMPANY HAS OVER 40 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE ACTING AS A DISTRIBUTOR TO U.S. MILITARY COMMISSARIES AND EXCHANGES. THE COMPANY IS THE EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE SUPPLIER OF PRIVATE BRAND PRODUCTS TO U.S. MILITARY COMMISSARIES AND IS CONTINUING TO PARTNER WI  TH DECA IN THE ROLLOUT OF PRIVATE BRAND PRODUCTS TO MILITARY COMMISSARIES WHICH BEGAN DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017.  AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER, THE COMPANY\u2019S RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATED 159 CORPORATE OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE MIDWEST REGION PRIMARILY UNDER THE BANNERS OF  FAMILY FARE, MARTIN\u2019S SUPER MARKETS, VG\u2019S FOOD AND PHARMACY, D&W FRESH MARKETS, SUN MART  AND  FAMILY FRESH MARKET.  THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS PHARMACY SERVICES IN 99 OF ITS CORPORATE OWNED RETAIL STORES AND OPERATES 37 FUEL CENTERS. THE RETAIL STORES HAVE A \u201cNEIGHBORHOOD MARKET\u201d FOCUS TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM SUPERCENTERS AND LIMITED ASSORTMENT STORES.  ALL FISCAL QUARTERS ARE 12 WEEKS, EXCEPT FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S FIRST QUARTER, WHICH IS 16 WEEKS AND WILL GENERALLY INCLUDE THE EASTER HOLIDAY. THE FOURTH QUARTER INCLUDES THE THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS, AND DEPENDING ON THE FISCAL YEAR END, MAY INCLUDE THE NEW YEAR\u2019S HOLIDAY.  IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE MAY VARY WITH SEASONALITY. MANY STORES ARE DEPENDENT ON TOURISM AND THEREFORE, ARE MOST AFFECTED BY SEASONS AND WEATHER PATTERNS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF SNOWFALL DURING THE WINTER MONTHS AND THE RANGE OF TEMPERATURE DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS.  2019 FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED APRIL 20, 2019, THE COMPANY MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND BETTER POSITIONED ITSELF FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. IN LINE WITH ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE TO ACHIEVE MID-SINGLE DIGIT SALES GROWTH, THE COMPANY REALIZED AN INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED NET SALES OF 6.6% COMPARED WITH THE QUARTER ENDED APRIL 21, 2018. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER WAS DRIVEN BY THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S SUPER MARKETS, INC. (\u201cMARTIN\u2019S\u201d), AS WELL AS SALES GROWTH IN THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION AND MILITARY DISTRIBUTION SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON ITS OTHER TOP OBJECTIVES FOR THE CURRENT YEAR, INCLUDING STRENGTHENING ITS MANAGEMENT TEAM, SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS, GENERATING  IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH ITS PROJECT ONE TEAM INITIATIVE, AND REDUCING ITS DEBT, WORKING CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL LEVERAGE RATIOS, WHICH WILL ALL CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVED GROWTH IN ADJUSTED OPERATING EARNINGS AND ADJUSTED EBITDA.  FIRST QUARTER 2019 OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE.  \u2022  THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT REALIZED SALES GROWTH OF 1.2% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. BEFORE THE IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY SALES TO MARTIN\u2019S, SALES INCREASED 5.2%, DRIVEN LARGELY BY SALES TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON PARTNERING WITH INDEPENDENT RETAILERS TO SUPPORT THEIR OPERATIONS AND ENHANCE THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE.  \u2022  LATE IN THE FIRST QUARTER, THE COMPANY INITIATED A VOLUNTARY PRODUCT RECALL FOR FRESH-CUT MELON PRODUCTS PRODUCED AT THE CAITO FACILITY IN INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA DUE TO POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE RECALL, THE COMPANY TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED PRODUCTION OF THE RECALLED PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON PRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION AND SPECIFICALLY WITHIN ITS FRESH CUT FRUIT AND VEGETABLE OPERATIONS. TESTING WAS PERFORMED WITHIN THE MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT BY THIRD PARTY FOOD SAFETY EXPERTS AS WELL AS THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) AND NO EVIDENCE OF CONTAMINATION WAS DETECTED, A PROCESS WHICH INCLUDED OVER 1,000 TESTS AMONG THE VARIOUS PARTIES. THE COMPANY IS WORKING TO IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL TESTING OF INCOMING PRODUCT TO FURTHER ENHANCE ITS FOOD SAFETY PROTOCOLS.  \u2022  THE MILITARY SEGMENT CONTINUED TO SUPPORT DECA IN THE EXPANSION OF ITS PRIVATE BRAND PROGRAM, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO SALES GROWTH IN THE QUARTER. THE COMPANY ALSO GAINED INCREMENTAL SALES WITH AN EXISTING CUSTOMER WHICH OFFSET THE CHALLENGES OF OPERATING IN A COMMISSARY ENVIRONMENT WHICH CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE  NEGATIVE SALES TRENDS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE DISTRIBUTION CENTER THAT EXPERIENCED OPERATIONAL ISSUES IN LATE 2018 AND INTO THE BEGINNING OF 2019. THE COMPANY HAS MADE KEY LEADERSHIP CHANGES AND IMPLEMENTED ENHANCEMENTS TO ITS PROCESSES AND CONTROLS. BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER, THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER\u2019S PERFORMANCE WAS STABILIZED, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE METRICS AND PROFITABILITY RETURNED TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN ITS EXECUTION OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S NEW RETAIL BRAND POSITIONING. SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER, THE COMPANY UNVEILED THE REMODEL OF 18 STORES IN MICHIGAN. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BEGIN REALIZING THE BENEFIT OF THESE INVESTMENTS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2019. THESE INVESTMENTS SUPPORT THE COMPANY\u2019S OBJECTIVES RELATED TO BRAND REPOSITIONING AND IT EXPECTS THAT THEY WILL HELP IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN FISCAL 2019 COMPARABLE STORE SALES.  18  \u2022  THE COMPANY  CLOSED ON THE ACQUISITION OF  MARTIN\u2019S IN EARLY 2019. MARTIN\u2019S IS A LEADING MIDWEST INDEPENDENT SUPERMARKET CHAIN WHICH OPERATES 21 STORES IN NORTHERN INDIANA AND  SOUTHWESTERN MICHIGAN. THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S HAS CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN SALES AND OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT  AND WILL CONTINUE TO COMPLEMENT THE COMPANY\u2019S EXISTING RETAIL INITIATIVES.  \u2022  THE COMPANY CONTINUED ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH A THIRD-PARTY ADVISORY FIRM ON A COMPANY-WIDE INITIATIVE, PROJECT ONE TEAM, DESIGNED TO TRANSFORM ITS CULTURE AND EMPOWER ASSOCIATES AT ALL LEVELS TO DRIVE SUBSTANTIAL ONGOING, SUSTAINABLE IMPROVEMENTS TO BUSINESS PROCESSES AND RESULTS. THE COMPANY SET AN INITIAL GOAL TO REALIZE AN ANNUAL RUN RATE OF AT LEAST $15 MILLION IN SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT 24 MONTHS FROM THIS INITIATIVE. THE COMPANY IS ON ITS WAY TO EXCEEDING THIS OBJECTIVE BY IDENTIFYING OVER $20 MILLION IN ANNUAL RUN RATE SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH THE COMPANY WILL IMPLEMENT OVER THE  NEXT 24 MONTHS.  THE EFFECT OF IMPLEMENTING THESE OPPORTUNITIES IS NOT CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN 2019.  \u2022  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER, THE COMPANY APPOINTED A NEW CHIEF MERCHANDISING AND MARKETING OFFICER, CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER AND SEVERAL OTHER KEY ADDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE IT AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS. OTHER STRATEGIC ADDITIONS TO THE MANAGEMENT TEAM AT VARIOUS LEVELS ARE IN PROCESS AS PART OF A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED PLAN TO STRENGTHEN THE MANAGEMENT TEAM, SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS.  \u2022  ADJUSTED FOR THE FUNDING OF THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY PAID DOWN OVER $20 MILLION IN DEBT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE COMPANY ALSO REDUCED ITS INVENTORY LEVELS BY OVER 2% FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WITHOUT NEGATIVELY IMPACTING CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS, DESPITE CONTINUED SALES GROWTH. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON DEBT AND WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019, THE COMPANY EXPECTS FOOD DISTRIBUTION TO ACHIEVE LOW- TO MID-SINGLE DIGIT SALES GROWTH DRIVEN BY EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND NEW BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SOME ATTRITION IN THE INDEPENDENT RETAIL BASE. THIS EXPECTATION EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY SALES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE MARTIN\u2019S BUSINESS, ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $150 TO $170 MILLION. IN THE MILITARY SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT NEW BUSINESS WITHIN THE SEGMENT, INCLUDING CONTINUED PRIVATE BRAND GROWTH, WILL LARGELY OFFSET THE NEGATIVE DECA COMPARABLE SALES TREND. WITHIN THE RETAIL SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TOTAL SALES WILL INCREASE DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S AND THE SIGNIFICANT CURRENT YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BRAND POSITIONING, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF STORE RATIONALIZATION PLANS. MARTIN\u2019S IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $475 MILLION TO $500 MILLION IN RETAIL SEGMENT NET SALES. FROM A PROFITABILITY PERSPECTIVE, THE EXPECTED NET SALES INCREASES WILL BE OFFSET BY CHALLENGES PRIMARILY WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN ENVIRONMENT, WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO NAVIGATE HISTORICALLY TIGHT LABOR MARKETS AND A HIGHER COST OF TRANSPORTATION. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS LESS CONTRIBUTION FROM THE FRESH KITCHEN OPERATIONS THAN INITIALLY ANTICIPATED AND HAS ENGAGED OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS TO WORK WITH THE SPARTANNASH TEAM TO GENERATE PROFITABILITY IN THIS BUSINESS. THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF THESE OPERATIONS IN THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT AND IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT AND, AS SUCH, THE IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE KEY TO THE COMPANY\u2019S OBJECTIVES IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH ITEMS FROM THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES AND THE YEAR-TO-YEAR PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS.

MILITARY NET SALES INCREASED $7.8 MILLION, OR 1.2%, TO $671.4 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER FROM $663.6 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL VOLUME FROM NEW BUSINESS WITH AN EXISTING CUSTOMER THAT COMMENCED LATE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND GROWTH IN DECA\u2019S PRIVATE BRAND PROGRAM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMPARABLE SALES AT DECA OPERATED LOCATIONS.  RETAIL NET SALES INCREASED $135.5 MILLION, OR 23.9%, TO $701.8 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER FROM $566.2 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREMENTAL SALES FROM THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF MARTIN\u2019S, SALES DECREASED 3.0%, AS A RESULT OF STORE CLOSURES AND A DECREASE IN FUEL PRICES PER GALLON.

FOOD DISTRIBUTION OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED $0.1 MILLION, OR 0.3%, TO $24.6 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER FROM $24.5 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.

MILITARY OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED $3.1 MILLION, OR 202.9%, TO A $1.6 MILLION OPERATING LOSS IN THE FIRST QUARTER FROM $1.5 MILLION IN OPERATING EARNINGS IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ADJUSTED EBITDA PROVIDES A MEANINGFUL REPRESENTATION OF ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR THE COMPANY AND FOR ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ADJUSTED EBITDA AS AN ADDITIONAL WAY TO MEASURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE ON AN ONGOING BASIS. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS MEANT TO REFLECT THE ONGOING OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF ALL OF ITS DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL OPERATIONS; CONSEQUENTLY, IT EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF ITEMS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED \u201cNON-OPERATING\u201d OR \u201cNON-CORE\u201d IN NATURE, AND ALSO EXCLUDES THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ACTIVITIES CLASSIFIED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. BECAUSE ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA BY SEGMENT ARE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT MANAGEMENT USES TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES, ASSESS PERFORMANCE AGAINST ITS PEERS AND EVALUATE OVERALL PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION FOR BOTH MANAGEMENT AND ITS INVESTORS. IN ADDITION, SECURITIES ANALYSTS, FUND MANAGERS AND OTHER SHAREHOLDERS AND STAKEHOLDERS THAT COMMUNICATE WITH THE COMPANY REQUEST ITS OPERATING FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ADJUSTED EBITDA FORMAT.  ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA BY SEGMENT ARE NOT MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER INCOME OR CASH FLOW STATEMENT DATA.

NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED DURING THE CURRENT YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD FROM THE PRIOR YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD BY APPROXIMATELY $46.9 MILLION AND WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE TIMING OF WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, PARTICULARLY DUE TO INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY BALANCES DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN SALES VOLUMES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVEMENTS IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $66.3 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION MADE IN THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF REAL PROPERTY FOR A PREVIOUSLY CLOSED SITE AND FEWER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES THAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION, MILITARY AND RETAIL SEGMENTS UTILIZED 26.5%, 7.1% AND 66.4% OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $114.4 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR USE OF CASH PRIMARILY DUE TO BORROWINGS ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO FUND THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION AND WORKING CAPITAL.  NET CASH USED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  NET CASH USED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS CONTAINS THE NET CASH FLOWS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S RETAIL AND FOOD DISTRIBUTION DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF FACILITY MAINTENANCE EXPENDITURES.  DEBT MANAGEMENT  TOTAL DEBT, INCLUDING FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES, WAS $771.1 MILLION AND $698.1 MILLION AS OF APRIL 20, 2019 AND DECEMBER 29, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL DEBT WAS DRIVEN BY THE CURRENT YEAR ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PAYMENTS.  LIQUIDITY  THE COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND ITS SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY WHICH HAS MAXIMUM AVAILABLE CREDIT OF $1.1 BILLION. AS OF APRIL 20, 2019, THE SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY HAD OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OF $727.7 MILLION. ADDITIONAL AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S $1.1 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY ARE BASED ON STIPULATED ADVANCE RATES ON ELIGIBLE ASSETS, AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAIN EXCESS AVAILABILITY OF 10% OF THE BORROWING BASE, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY HAD EXCESS AVAILABILITY AFTER THE 10% COVENANT OF $204.7 MILLION AT APRIL 20, 2019. PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASES OF OUTSTANDING SHARES ARE PERMITTED, PROVIDED THAT CERTAIN LEVELS OF EXCESS AVAILABILITY ARE MAINTAINED. THE CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES FOR THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT, OF WHICH $13.1 MILLION WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF APRIL 20, 2019. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY MATURES DECEMBER 18, 2023 AND IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, AND DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE CASH FLOW AT OR ABOVE CURRENT LEVELS OR THAT THE COMPANY WILL MAINTAIN ITS ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT RATIO (CURRENT ASSETS TO CURRENT LIABILITIES) WAS 1.90-TO-1 AT APRIL 20, 2019 COMPARED TO 2.10-TO-1 AT DECEMBER 29, 2018, AND ITS INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS $497.7 MILLION AT APRIL 20, 2019 COMPARED TO $524.6 MILLION AT DECEMBER 29, 2018. NET DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO WAS 0.52-TO-1 AT APRIL 20, 2019 COMPARED TO 0.49-TO-1 AT DECEMBER 29, 2018. THE CURRENT YEAR RATIOS INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE STANDARD (ASU 2016-02) AND THEREFORE LACK COMPARABILITY TO THE PRIOR YEAR RATIOS.  27  TOTAL NET DEBT IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT IS DEFINED AS LONG-TERM DEBT AND  FINANCE  LEASE  LIABILITIES  , PLUS CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND  FINANCE  LEASE  LIABILITIES  , LESS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE RATIO OF NET DEBT TO CAPITAL IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET DEBT, AS DEFINED PREVIOUSLY, BY TOTAL CAPITAL (NET DEBT PLUS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY). THE COMPANY BELIEVES BOTH MANAGE  MENT AND ITS INVESTORS FIND THE INFORMATION USEFUL BECAUSE IT REFLECTS THE AMOUNT OF LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY AVAILABLE CASH AND TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS. TOTAL NET DEBT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND MAY DIFFER  FROM SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES.  FOLLOWING IS A RECONCILIATION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES TO TOTAL NET LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES AS OF APRIL 20, 2019 AND DECEMBER 29, 2018.  APRIL 20,  DECEMBER 29,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES  $18,006  $18,263  LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES  753,118  679,797  TOTAL DEBT  771,124  698,060  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  (21,360  )  (18,585  )  TOTAL NET LONG-TERM DEBT  $749,764  $679,475  FOR INFORMATION ON CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, SEE THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018. AT APRIL 20, 2019, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANY\u2019S SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.  CASH DIVIDENDS  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED APRIL 20, 2019, THE COMPANY RETURNED $6.9 MILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS FROM DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. A 5.6% INCREASE IN THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND RATE FROM $0.18 PER SHARE TO $0.19 PER SHARE WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ANNOUNCED ON FEBRUARY 28, 2019. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO PAY A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND, ADOPTION OF A DIVIDEND POLICY DOES NOT COMMIT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO DECLARE FUTURE DIVIDENDS. EACH FUTURE DIVIDEND WILL BE CONSIDERED AND DECLARED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT ITS DISCRETION. WHETHER THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONTINUES TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION, ANTICIPATED PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF ITS CREDIT FACILITIES.  UNDER THE SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE COMPANY IS GENERALLY PERMITTED TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN ANY FISCAL YEAR UP TO AN AMOUNT SUCH THAT ALL CASH DIVIDENDS, TOGETHER WITH ANY CASH DISTRIBUTIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, DO NOT EXCEED $35.0 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS GENERALLY PERMITTED TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE SHARES IN EXCESS OF $35.0 MILLION IN ANY FISCAL YEAR SO LONG AS ITS EXCESS AVAILABILITY, AS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, IS IN EXCESS OF 10% OF THE TOTAL BORROWING BASE, AS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, BEFORE AND AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY HAS ALSO MADE CERTAIN COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS THAT EXTEND BEYOND APRIL 20, 2019. THESE COMMITMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PURCHASE COMMITMENTS (AS DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018), STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT OF $13.1 MILLION AS OF APRIL 20, 2019, AND INTEREST ON LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, THE COMPANY EVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO BAD DEBTS, INVENTORIES, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCOME TAXES, SELF-INSURANCE RESERVES, RESTRUCTURING COSTS, RETIREMENT BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT MAY NOT BE READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S ONGOING REVIEW, THE COMPANY MAKES ADJUSTMENTS IT CONSIDERS APPROPRIATE UNDER THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHERS SET FORTH IN ITEM 8, NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 SHOULD BE REVIEWED AS THEY ARE INTEGRAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE DECREASES IN BOTH THE THREE AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS WERE DUE TO THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, AND THE REMAINDER OF THE DECREASES WERE DUE TO ONGOING EFFICIENCY ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT OUR SG&A FUNCTIONS AND THE IMPACT OF THE SALE OF A BUSINESS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  OPERATING INCOME INCREASED  5.1%  TO  $39.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , AND  7.7%  TO  $116.3 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $37.7 MILLION  AND  $107.9 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIODS OF THE PRIOR YEAR, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASES IN BOTH THE THREE AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED ORGANIC SALES AND SEGMENT PROFIT WITHIN THE IDS BUSINESS ALONG WITH REDUCED SG&A EXPENSES.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OPERATING INCOME TO NET INCOME  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019%  SALES  2018%  SALES  2019%  SALES  2018%  SALES  OPERATING INCOME  $39,621  13.7%  $37,709  12.6%  $116,273  13.4%  $107,916  12.3%  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).

FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS, THE DECREASES IN INTEREST EXPENSE WERE DUE TO THE COMPANY'S DECLINING PRINCIPAL BALANCES UNDER ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT AGREEMENTS.  THE INCOME TAX RATE WAS  15.1%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  29.7%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCOME TAX RATE WAS  19.5%  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  47.4%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP)  FREE CASH FLOW IS A KEY FINANCIAL MEASURE OF OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL CASH FROM OPERATING OUR BUSINESS AND IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  WE DEFINE FREE CASH FLOW AS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, LESS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  PLUS THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF OPERATING ASSETS.  FREE CASH FLOW IS A RELEVANT INDICATOR OF OUR ABILITY TO REPAY MATURING DEBT, REVISE OUR DIVIDEND POLICY OR FUND OTHER USES OF CAPITAL THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ENHANCE STOCKHOLDER VALUE.  FREE CASH FLOW IS CONSIDERED A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE UNDER THE RULES OF THE SEC.  FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT REMAINING CASH FLOW AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MEASURE DOES NOT DEDUCT PAYMENTS REQUIRED FOR DEBT MATURITIES, PAYMENTS MADE FOR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS OR REQUIRED PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS, IF ANY.

OUR APPLICATIONS ARE DESIGNED AROUND THE WAY PEOPLE WORK TODAY\u2014IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS GLOBAL, COLLABORATIVE, FAST-PACED, AND MOBILE. OUR CYCLE OF FREQUENT UPDATES HAS FACILITATED RAPID INNOVATION AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW APPLICATIONS THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY. WE BEGAN OFFERING OUR HCM APPLICATION IN 2006 AND OUR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT APPLICATION IN 2007. SINCE THEN WE HAVE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN INNOVATION AND HAVE CONSISTENTLY INTRODUCED NEW SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS.  WE OFFER WORKDAY APPLICATIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS ON AN ENTERPRISE-WIDE SUBSCRIPTION BASIS, TYPICALLY WITH CONTRACT TERMS OF THREE YEARS OR LONGER AND WITH SUBSCRIPTION FEES LARGELY BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE CUSTOMER\u2019S WORKFORCE. WE GENERALLY RECOGNIZE REVENUES FROM SUBSCRIPTION FEES RATABLY OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT. WE CURRENTLY DERIVE A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES REVENUES FROM SUBSCRIPTIONS TO OUR HCM APPLICATION. WE MARKET OUR APPLICATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE.  OUR DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE INCLUDES MEDIUM-SIZED AND LARGE, GLOBAL COMPANIES, AS WELL AS SMALLER ORGANIZATIONS THAT PRIMARILY USE OUR PLANNING PRODUCT. WE HAVE ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WITH A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF OUR GROWTH COMING FROM NEW CUSTOMERS. OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL FOCUS IS ON GROWING OUR REVENUES AND EXPANDING OUR CUSTOMER BASE. WHILE WE ARE INCURRING LOSSES TODAY, WE STRIVE TO INVEST IN A DISCIPLINED MANNER ACROSS ALL OF OUR FUNCTIONAL AREAS TO SUSTAIN CONTINUED NEAR-TERM REVENUE GROWTH AND SUPPORT OUR LONG-TERM INITIATIVES. OUR OPERATING EXPENSES HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS IN RECENT PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OF OUR EMPLOYEE POPULATION. WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  11,000  AND APPROXIMATELY  8,600  EMPLOYEES AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  WE INTEND TO CONTINUE INVESTING FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH.

WE EXPECT TO MAKE FURTHER SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR DATA CENTER CAPACITY AS WE PLAN FOR FUTURE GROWTH. WE ARE ALSO INVESTING IN PERSONNEL TO SERVICE OUR GROWING CUSTOMER BASE.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ALSO REGULARLY EVALUATE ACQUISITIONS OR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES, JOINT VENTURES, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN AN EFFORT TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SUCH ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE, AND WE PLAN TO REINVEST A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INCREMENTAL REVENUE IN FUTURE PERIODS TO GROW OUR BUSINESS AND CONTINUE OUR LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE INDUSTRY. WHILE WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OPERATING MARGINS, THESE ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS WILL INCREASE OUR COSTS ON AN ABSOLUTE BASIS IN THE NEAR-TERM. MANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS WILL OCCUR IN ADVANCE OF EXPERIENCING ANY DIRECT BENEFIT FROM THEM AND COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE IF WE ARE ALLOCATING OUR RESOURCES EFFICIENTLY. WE EXPECT OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES TO DECREASE OVER TIME AS WE GROW OUR REVENUES, AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL GAIN ECONOMIES OF SCALE BY INCREASING OUR CUSTOMER BASE WITHOUT DIRECT INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND BY UTILIZING MORE OF THE CAPACITY OF OUR DATA CENTERS.  SINCE INCEPTION, WE HAVE ALSO INVESTED HEAVILY IN OUR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION TO HELP ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOY AND ADOPT OUR APPLICATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR PROFESSIONAL SERVICE PARTNER ECOSYSTEM TO FURTHER SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS.

SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES REVENUES ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, THE NUMBER OF WORKERS AT EACH CUSTOMER, THE SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS SUBSCRIBED TO BY EACH CUSTOMER, AND THE PRICE OF OUR APPLICATIONS.  THE MIX OF THE APPLICATIONS TO WHICH A CUSTOMER SUBSCRIBES CAN AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DUE TO PRICE DIFFERENTIALS IN OUR APPLICATIONS. PRICING FOR OUR APPLICATIONS VARIES BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPLEXITY AND MATURITY OF THE APPLICATION AND ITS ACCEPTANCE IN THE MARKETPLACE. NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERINGS BY COMPETITORS IN THE FUTURE COULD ALSO IMPACT THE MIX AND PRICING OF OUR OFFERINGS.

IN SOME CASES, WE SUPPLEMENT OUR CONSULTING TEAMS BY SUBCONTRACTING RESOURCES FROM OUR SERVICE PARTNERS AND DEPLOYING THEM ON CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENTS.

WE USE THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES TO UNDERSTAND AND COMPARE OPERATING RESULTS ACROSS ACCOUNTING PERIODS, FOR INTERNAL BUDGETING AND FORECASTING PURPOSES, FOR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM OPERATING PLANS, AND TO EVALUATE OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS AND OTHERS IN UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND PROSPECTS IN THE SAME MANNER AS MANAGEMENT AND IN COMPARING FINANCIAL RESULTS ACROSS ACCOUNTING PERIODS AND TO THOSE OF PEER COMPANIES.

(2)  OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAX-RELATED ITEMS ON EMPLOYEE STOCK TRANSACTIONS OF  $27 MILLION  AND  $14 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDED AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF  $19 MILLION  AND  $5 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  (3)  SEE \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  COSTS OF SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES  SEE THE TABLE ABOVE FOR A RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES.  GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES IN COSTS OF SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES WERE  $112 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $80 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD,  AN INCREASE  OF  $32 MILLION  , OR  40%  . THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES OF  $14 MILLION  IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE INCLUDING OUR ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS,  $7 MILLION  IN EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS DRIVEN BY HIGHER HEADCOUNT, AND  $7 MILLION  IN THIRD-PARTY COSTS FOR HARDWARE MAINTENANCE AND DATA CENTER CAPACITY.  NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES IN COSTS OF SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES WERE  $89 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $68 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD,  AN INCREASE  OF  $21 MILLION  , OR 31%. THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES OF  $7 MILLION  IN THIRD-PARTY COSTS FOR HARDWARE MAINTENANCE AND DATA CENTER CAPACITY, AND  $6 MILLION  IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE RELATED TO EQUIPMENT IN OUR DATA CENTERS.  WE EXPECT THAT GAAP AND NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES IN COSTS OF SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS AS WE IMPROVE AND EXPAND OUR DATA CENTER CAPACITY AND OPERATIONS.  COSTS OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES  SEE THE TABLE ABOVE FOR A RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES.  GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES IN COSTS OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES WERE  $131 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $98 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD,  AN INCREASE  OF  $33 MILLION  , OR  34%  . THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL COSTS TO STAFF OUR DEPLOYMENT AND INTEGRATION ENGAGEMENTS.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES IN COSTS OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES WERE  $111 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $85 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD,  AN INCREASE  OF  $26 MILLION  , OR 31%. THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL COSTS TO STAFF OUR DEPLOYMENT AND INTEGRATION ENGAGEMENTS.  GOING FORWARD, WE EXPECT GAAP AND NON-GAAP COSTS OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES TO CONTINUE TO DECLINE AS WE CONTINUE TO RELY ON OUR SERVICE PARTNERS TO DEPLOY OUR APPLICATIONS AND AS THE NUMBER OF OUR CUSTOMERS CONTINUES TO GROW. FOR FISCAL 2020, WE ANTICIPATE GAAP AND NON-GAAP PROFESSIONAL SERVICES MARGINS TO BE LOWER THAN FISCAL 2019 AS WE INVEST IN PROGRAMS TO ENSURE ONGOING CUSTOMER SUCCESS.  PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT  SEE THE TABLE ABOVE FOR A RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES.  GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT WERE  $348 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $264 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD,  AN INCREASE  OF  $84 MILLION  , OR  32%  . THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES OF  $72 MILLION  IN EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS DRIVEN BY HIGHER HEADCOUNT AND  $6 MILLION  IN FACILITY AND IT-RELATED EXPENSES.  NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT WERE  $243 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $186 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD,  AN INCREASE  OF  $57 MILLION  , OR 31%. THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES OF  $45 MILLION  IN EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS DRIVEN BY HIGHER HEADCOUNT AND  $6 MILLION  IN FACILITY AND IT-RELATED EXPENSES.  WE EXPECT THAT GAAP AND NON-GAAP PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS AS WE IMPROVE AND EXTEND OUR APPLICATIONS AND DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES.  SALES AND MARKETING  SEE THE TABLE ABOVE FOR A RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES.  GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES IN SALES AND MARKETING WERE  $273 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $193 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD,  AN INCREASE  OF  $80 MILLION  , OR 41%. THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO  $60 MILLION  INCREASE IN EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS DRIVEN BY HIGHER HEADCOUNT AND HIGHER COMMISSIONABLE SALES VOLUME, AND  $7 MILLION  IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES IN SALES AND MARKETING WERE  $221 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $165 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD,  AN INCREASE  OF $56 MILLION, OR  34%  . THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES OF  $43 MILLION  IN EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS DRIVEN BY HIGHER HEADCOUNT AND HIGHER COMMISSIONABLE SALES VOLUME.  WE EXPECT THAT GAAP AND NON-GAAP SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES WILL INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS AS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SELLING AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES TO EXPAND BRAND AWARENESS AND ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  SEE THE TABLE ABOVE FOR A RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES.  GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE WERE  $84 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $56 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD,  AN INCREASE  OF $28 MILLION, OR 50%. THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS DRIVEN BY HIGHER HEADCOUNT.  NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE WERE  $53 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $34 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD,  AN INCREASE  OF  $19 MILLION  , OR 56%. THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS DRIVEN BY HIGHER HEADCOUNT.  WE EXPECT GAAP AND NON-GAAP GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS AS WE FURTHER INVEST IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUPPORT OUR GLOBAL EXPANSION.  OPERATING MARGINS  GAAP OPERATING MARGINS  DECLINED  FROM  (11.5)%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018  TO  (15.0)%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  . THE  REDUCTION  IN OUR GAAP OPERATING MARGINS IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES FROM INCREASED HEADCOUNT AND HIGHER ACQUISITION-RELATED AMORTIZATION EXPENSES, OFFSET BY HIGHER REVENUES.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE USE THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGINS TO UNDERSTAND AND COMPARE OPERATING RESULTS ACROSS ACCOUNTING PERIODS, FOR INTERNAL BUDGETING AND FORECASTING PURPOSES, FOR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM OPERATING PLANS, AND TO EVALUATE OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. WE BELIEVE THAT NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGINS REFLECT OUR ONGOING BUSINESS IN A MANNER THAT ALLOWS FOR MEANINGFUL PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS AND ANALYSIS OF TRENDS IN OUR BUSINESS, AS THEY EXCLUDE EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF ONGOING OPERATING RESULTS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGINS PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS AND OTHERS IN UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND PROSPECTS IN THE SAME MANNER AS MANAGEMENT AND IN COMPARING FINANCIAL RESULTS ACROSS ACCOUNTING PERIODS AND TO THOSE OF PEER COMPANIES.  NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGINS ARE CALCULATED USING GAAP REVENUES AND NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES. SEE \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGINS REMAINED CONSTANT AT  13.1%  FOR EACH OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 AND 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER REVENUES THAT WERE OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES.  RECONCILIATIONS OF OUR GAAP TO NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGINS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES  OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES  NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES  (1)  OPERATING MARGIN  (15.0  )%  22.5%  5.6%  13.1%  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018  GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES  OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES  NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES  (1)  OPERATING MARGIN  (11.5  )%  21.4%  3.2%  13.1%  (1)  SEE \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  OTHER  INCOME  , NET  INCREASED  $11 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A  $7 MILLION  REDUCTION IN INTEREST EXPENSE AND A $7 MILLION GAIN RESULTING FROM SALES OF MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  , OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WERE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES TOTALING  $1.9 BILLION  , WHICH WERE PRIMARILY HELD FOR WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES. OUR CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE COMPOSED PRIMARILY OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, CORPORATE BONDS, COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  WE HAVE FINANCED OUR OPERATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH CUSTOMER PAYMENTS, SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, AND ISSUANCE OF DEBT. OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR CUSTOMER GROWTH RATE, SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL ACTIVITY, THE TIMING OF CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES IN PLEASANTON, CALIFORNIA, AND THE ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL FACILITIES, THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS, THE EXPANSION OF SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW AND ENHANCED SERVICES OFFERINGS, THE CONTINUING MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR SERVICES, AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES. WE MAY ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS TO ACQUIRE OR INVEST IN COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES, SERVICES, TECHNOLOGIES, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE FUTURE. WE ALSO MAY CHOOSE TO SEEK ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING.  OUR CASH FLOWS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018  WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  2019  2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN).

THE  IMPROVEMENT  IN CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN SALES AND THE RELATED CASH COLLECTIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES DRIVEN BY INCREASED HEADCOUNT.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  WAS  $67 MILLION  , WHICH WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR DATA CENTER AND OFFICE SPACE PROJECTS OF  $66 MILLION  , CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF OUR DEVELOPMENT CENTER OF  $34 MILLION  , AND THE TIMING OF PURCHASES AND MATURITIES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES. THESE PAYMENTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS OF  $51 MILLION  FROM SALES OF MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018  WAS  $285 MILLION  , WHICH WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE TIMING OF PURCHASES AND MATURITIES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF OUR DEVELOPMENT CENTER OF $32 MILLION AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR DATA CENTER AND OFFICE SPACE PROJECTS OF $49 MILLION. THESE PAYMENTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS OF $27 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES.  WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO OWNED REAL ESTATE PROJECTS, INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION OF OUR DEVELOPMENT CENTER, WILL BE APPROXIMATELY  $130 MILLION  FOR FISCAL 2020. WE ALSO EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EXCLUDING OWNED REAL ESTATE PROJECTS, WILL BE APPROXIMATELY  $280 MILLION  FOR FISCAL 2020. THESE CAPITAL OUTLAYS WILL LARGELY BE USED TO EXPAND THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR DATA CENTERS AND TO BUILD OUT ADDITIONAL OFFICE SPACE TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $3 MILLION  FOR EACH OF THE THREE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 AND 2018, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK FROM EMPLOYEE EQUITY PLANS.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  REGULATION S-K ITEM 10(E), \u201cUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN COMMISSION FILINGS,\u201d DEFINES AND PRESCRIBES THE CONDITIONS FOR USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION. OUR MEASURES OF NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES AND NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN MEET THE DEFINITION OF A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.  NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES AND NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGINS  WE DEFINE NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES AS OUR TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES EXCLUDING THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONAL EXPENSES. SIMILARLY, THE SAME COMPONENTS ARE ALSO EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION OF NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGINS. IN EACH CASE, FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH BELOW, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT EXCLUDING THE COMPONENT PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS AND OTHERS IN UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND PROSPECTS IN THE SAME MANNER AS MANAGEMENT, IN COMPARING FINANCIAL RESULTS ACROSS ACCOUNTING PERIODS AND TO THOSE OF PEER COMPANIES, AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF OUR CORE BUSINESS.  \u2022  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES.  ALTHOUGH SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND EXECUTIVES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS USEFUL TO EXCLUDE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF OUR CORE BUSINESS AND TO FACILITATE COMPARISON OF OUR RESULTS TO THOSE OF PEER COMPANIES. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES ARE DETERMINED USING A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR STOCK PRICE, VOLATILITY, AND FORFEITURE RATES THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND GENERALLY UNRELATED TO OPERATIONAL DECISIONS AND PERFORMANCE IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD. FURTHER, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE VALUE ULTIMATELY RECEIVED BY THE GRANT RECIPIENTS.  \u2022  OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES.  OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDES EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAX-RELATED ITEMS ON EMPLOYEE STOCK TRANSACTIONS AND AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE AMOUNT OF EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAX-RELATED ITEMS ON EMPLOYEE STOCK TRANSACTIONS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR STOCK PRICE AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND DO NOT CORRELATE TO THE OPERATION OF THE BUSINESS. FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, WE GENERALLY ALLOCATE A PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOCATION IS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY MANAGEMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. THE AMOUNT OF PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE TERM OF ITS RELATED AMORTIZATION CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AND ARE UNIQUE TO EACH ACQUISITION, AND THUS WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS REFLECTIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS.  LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  A LIMITATION OF OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES OF NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES AND NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN IS THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE UNIFORM DEFINITIONS. OUR DEFINITIONS WILL LIKELY DIFFER FROM THE DEFINITIONS USED BY OTHER COMPANIES, INCLUDING PEER COMPANIES, AND THEREFORE COMPARABILITY MAY BE LIMITED. FURTHER, THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES HAS CERTAIN LIMITATIONS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT REFLECT ALL ITEMS OF EXPENSE THAT AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND ARE REFLECTED IN THE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES. IN THE CASE OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, IF WE DID NOT PAY OUT A PORTION OF COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND RELATED EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAX-RELATED ITEMS, THE CASH SALARY EXPENSE INCLUDED IN COSTS OF REVENUES AND OPERATING EXPENSES WOULD BE HIGHER, WHICH WOULD AFFECT OUR CASH POSITION.  WE COMPENSATE FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY RECONCILING THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR IN ISOLATION FROM, MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE ENCOURAGE INVESTORS AND OTHERS TO REVIEW OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION IN ITS ENTIRETY, NOT TO RELY ON ANY SINGLE FINANCIAL MEASURE, AND TO VIEW OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  SEE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u2014OPERATING EXPENSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u2014OPERATING MARGINS FOR RECONCILIATIONS FROM THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES AND GAAP OPERATING MARGINS, TO THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES AND NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGINS, FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF OUR CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES, AS WELL AS OBLIGATIONS UNDER LEASES FOR OFFICE SPACE, CO-LOCATION FACILITIES FOR DATA CENTER CAPACITY, AND COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE PLATFORMS FOR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2020, WE ANTICIPATE LEASING ADDITIONAL OFFICE SPACE NEAR OUR HEADQUARTERS AND IN VARIOUS OTHER LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH. IN ADDITION, OUR EXISTING LEASE AGREEMENTS OFTEN PROVIDE US WITH AN OPTION TO RENEW. WE EXPECT OUR FUTURE OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS WILL INCREASE AS WE EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE NOTES PRIOR TO MATURITY. IF THE NOTES ARE NOT CONVERTED TO CLASS A COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO THEIR MATURITY DATES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPAY $250 MILLION IN PRINCIPAL ON JULY 15, 2020 AND $1.15 BILLION IN PRINCIPAL ON OCTOBER 1, 2022. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO MAKE INTEREST PAYMENTS ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS AT THE INTEREST RATES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 10, CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES, NET, OF THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE DO NOT CONSIDER OUTSTANDING PURCHASE ORDERS TO BE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS THEY REPRESENT AUTHORIZATIONS TO PURCHASE RATHER THAN BINDING AGREEMENTS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THROUGH  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ORGANIZATIONS OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS STRUCTURED FINANCE OR SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, COSTS AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AS DESCRIBED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) ON MARCH 18, 2019.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Workday, Inc.", "CIK": 1327811, "Date": "2019-05-30T00:00:00", "Ticker": "WDAY", "Name": "Workday Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 7374.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 202480422.0, "key": "20190530WDAY", "labelr1": -1.8229041412149447, "labelr2": -5.9964726631393335, "labelr3": 2.0377319157806952, "labelr4": 1.9459625108534668, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.52382565, "prof1": 0.47617432, "return1&2": 1.079286867528575, "return1&2&3": 1.0572938945661154, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0367193517483162, "return2": 1.0599647266313934, "return1": 1.0182290414121495, "return3": 0.9796226808421932, "return4": 0.9805403748914652, "1_day_return": -1.8229041412149427, "cumulative_return1": 3.617291092204271, "cumulative_return1&2": 1.4208759360914145, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 2.1752819080287544, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 2.9904213460937417, "indexx": 1245, "cumreturn1b": 3.9521571909272852, "cumreturndow": 0.9412839345034182, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9388916773120652}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1253, "level_0": 1283, "index": 23089, "text": "ITEM 2.

THE  FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AND THE RELATED NOTES INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.  REVENUE  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE ENTIRE LINE OF WORKSPORT PRODUCTS WAS $572,278, COMPARED TO  $150,878 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 279% WAS MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE  TO THE AVAILABILITY OF INVENTORY TO PARTIALLY SATISFY CUSTOMER ORDERS.  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, REVENUE GENERATED IN CANADA WAS $25,602 COMPARED TO $102,141 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018,  A DECREASE OF 75%. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER DEMAND IN THE UNITED STATES, RESULTING IN TEMPORARILY LIMITED FACTORY  CAPACITY TO HANDLE CANADIAN MARKET SALES. THE RATE OF EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR AND THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR DURING  THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 WAS CONSISTENT, WHICH LIMITED THE HISTORICALLY NEGATIVE EFFECT ON REPORTED REVENUES AS A  RESULT OF TRANSLATING THE SALES DENOMINATED IN CANADIAN DOLLARS TO UNITED STATES DOLLARS FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, GROSS REVENUE GENERATED IN THE UNITED STATES WAS $583,422 COMPARED TO $48,736 FOR THE  SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THIS REPRESENTS A YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN US-SOURCED REVENUE OF APPROXIMATELY 1,097% AND IS PRIMARILY  ATTRIBUTABLE TO RE-ENTERING THE US MARKET AS OF MID-2018 AND CONTINUING TO INCREASE SALES WHICH INCLUDED ONLINE RETAILERS AND  THE SUPPORT OF FOUR PRIVATE LABELS, AFTER THE ALLOWANCE OF USE OF THE WORKSPORT TRADEMARK.  CURRENTLY,  WORKSPORT WORKS CLOSELY WITH ONE MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR IN CANADA, ALONG WITH ITS OWN CONTRACTED DISTRIBUTION AND INVENTORY FACILITY  IN BREINIGSVILLE, PA AND DEPEW, NY. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT ONLINE RETAILERS.  ALTHOUGH  WORKSPORT CURRENTLY SUPPORTS A TOTAL OF 10 DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WORKSPORT BELIEVES THE TREND OF INCREASING SALES THROUGH  ONLINE RETAILERS WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE THE TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS MODEL. MOREOVER, REPUTABLE ONLINE RETAILER\u2019S CUSTOMERS  TEND TO PROVIDE LARGER SALES VOLUMES, GREATER MARGIN OF PROFIT AS WELL AS GREATER PROTECTION AGAINST PRICE EROSION.  COST  OF SALES  COST  OF SALES INCREASED FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, WHEN COMPARED TO THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2018, BY 209%  FROM $139,937 TO $432,948. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE HIGHER VOLUME OF SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WHEN COMPARED  TO THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018. OUR COST OF SALES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, WAS APPROXIMATELY 76% AND 93% FOR THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  WITHIN  COST OF SALES, FREIGHT COSTS ACCOUNTED FOR 9% OF COST OF SALES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WHEREAS IN 2018,  IT ACCOUNTED FOR 26% OF COST OF SALES. THE LARGE DECREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF COST OF SALES IS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN SALES FOR  THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 BEING LARGER US ORDERS WITH ECONOMIES TO SCALE IN SHIPPING. ALSO, IN 2019, RETAIL ONLINE ORDERS  WERE DROP-SHIPPED SALES FOB CHINA TO OUR ONLINE VENDORS REDUCING INTERMEDIARY COSTS.  10  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WORKSPORT  PROVIDES ITS DISTRIBUTORS AND ONLINE RETAILERS AN \u201cALL-IN\u201d WHOLESALE PRICE. THIS INCLUDES ANY IMPORT DUTY CHARGES, TAXES  AND SHIPPING CHARGES. DISCOUNTS ARE APPLIED IF THE DISTRIBUTOR OR RETAILER CHOOSES TO USE THEIR OWN SHIPPING PROCESS. CERTAIN  EXCEPTIONS APPLY ON RARE OCCASIONS WHERE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED OUTSIDE THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES OR FROM THE UNITED STATES TO  CANADA. VOLUME DISCOUNTS ARE ALSO OFFERED TO CERTAIN HIGHER VOLUME CUSTOMERS.  GROSS  MARGIN  GROSS  MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018 WERE 24% AND 8% RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN GROSS  MARGIN REFLECTS AN INCREASE IN ONE-TIME SHIPPING COSTS IN LANDING PRODUCT IN OUR US WAREHOUSE FOR 2018. IN ADDITION, THE GROSS  MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WERE ABNORMALLY LOW AS A RESULT OF THE FLUCTUATION IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE  RATES USED TO TRANSLATE CANADIAN DOLLAR SALES INTO UNITED STATES DOLLARS FOR PURPOSES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING.  OPERATING  EXPENSES  OPERATING  EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WERE $226,644 COMPARED TO $189,956 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  ALTHOUGH THERE WERE DECREASES IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE, THESES EXPENSES WERE OFFSET BY LARGER  INCREASES IN SALES AND MARKETING, AND PROFESSIONAL FEES INCURRED FOR THE PERIOD.  \u25cf  GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE DECREASED BY $26,247, FROM $66,818 TO $40,571 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE  MAIN REASON FOR THE DECREASE WAS A MAJOR REDUCTION IN SALARIES PROVIDED TO THE CEO FOR THE FIRST QUARTER.  \u25cf  THE  COMPANY ALSO REALIZED A GAIN ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE IN THE AMOUNT OF $9,165 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, A DECREASE  OF $16,808 WHEN COMPARED TO A LOSS ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF ($7,643) DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE CURRENT  GAINS AND PREVIOUS LOSS WERE THE RESULT OF THE COMPANY CONVERTING CANADIAN CASH GENERATED BY SALES TO CANADIAN CUSTOMERS INTO  UNITED STATES DOLLARS IN ORDER TO PURCHASE INVENTORY AND PAY OPERATING EXPENSES DENOMINATED IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS.  \u25cf  PROFESSIONAL  FEES WHICH INCLUDE ACCOUNTING, LEGAL AND CONSULTING FEES, INCREASED FROM $121,526 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  TO $172,502 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE INCREASE IS RELATED TO INCREASED ACCOUNTING AND AUDIT FEES, CONSULTING,  LEGAL SERVICES AND SEC FILING FEES BETWEEN THE TWO PERIODS.  OTHER  INCOME AND EXPENSES  OTHER  INCOME AND EXPENSES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER AT MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $39,160 COMPARED WITH $512,431 AT MARCH 31, 2018. THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE  CONSISTED OF A LOSS ON DEBT SETTLEMENT OF $495,943 AND FINANCING CHARGES OF $9,198 THAT OCCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  DURING  THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED INTEREST OF $39,160 AN INCREASE OF $31,870 WHEN COMPARED TO  INTEREST EXPENSE OF $7,290 INCURRED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THIS WAS DUE TO THE INTEREST ACCRUALS NOT PREVIOUSLY  BEING RECORDED IN 2018 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR. THE COMPANY HAD ASSUMED CANADIAN AND US DOLLAR PROMISSORY NOTES IN 2017 IN THE  AMOUNT OF $123,392 WITH TERMS OF 12% AND 18%. IN ADDITION, TWO LINES OF CREDIT IN BOTH CANADIAN AND US DOLLAR CURRENCIES WERE  ASSUMED WITH AN INTEREST RATE OF 18% IN 2016. THE INTEREST FROM THESE LOANS WERE 95% OF THE INTEREST EXPENSE AND THE OTHER 5%  WAS FOR BANK INTEREST.  NET  LOSS  NET  LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $126,473 COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $691,446 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH  31, 2018, A DIFFERENCE OF $564,973 OR 82%. THE DECREASE IN THE NET LOSS WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE LOSS OF DEBT SETTLEMENT IN THE AMOUNT  OF $495,943; FINANCING COSTS OF $9,198; AND AN INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEES OF $50,976 AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  11  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH  FLOW ACTIVITIES  CASH  DECREASED FROM $25,323 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $21,900 AT MARCH 31, 2019. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE TIMING  OF INBOUND PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND OUTBOUND PAYMENTS TO VENDORS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASED BY $293,186 FROM $61,882 AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $355,068 AT MARCH 31, 2018. INVENTORY DECREASED AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $289,516 AT MARCH 31, 2018 TO $164,693  LARGELY AS A RESULT OF THE TIMING OF THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY SHIPMENTS. PREPAID EXPENSES DECREASED BY $118,688 FROM $124,114  AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $5,426 AT MARCH 31, 2019 DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF A LARGE AMOUNT OF CONSULTING SERVICES FOR THIS QUARTER.  PAYROLL TAXES PAYABLE DECREASED FROM $82,365 TO $65,376 DUE TO A LARGER REDUCTION IN SALARIES TO RELATED PARTIES. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE  AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES INCREASED BY $154,125 FROM $401,766 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $555,891 AT MARCH 31, 2018. THE INCREASE IN  PAYABLES IS RELATED TO LARGE PURCHASES RELATED TO INCREASED SALES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION) ANALYZES OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS AND THOSE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. IT ALSO INCLUDES MANAGEMENT\u2019S ANALYSIS OF PAST FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CERTAIN POTENTIAL FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS, POTENTIAL FUTURE RISKS AND APPROACHES THAT MAY BE USED TO MANAGE THOSE RISKS. SEE \"NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\" AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS REPORT FOR A LIST OF FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  WE ARE AN ENERGY HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 2005 WHOSE SUBSIDIARIES ARE FULLY REGULATED NATURAL GAS AND ELECTRIC UTILITY COMPANIES SERVING CUSTOMERS IN SEVEN STATES. WE GENERATE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR OPERATING INCOME THROUGH THESE RATE-REGULATED BUSINESSES WHICH ARE SUMMARIZED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES INTO TWO PRIMARY REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS AND ELECTRIC OPERATIONS.  REFER TO THE \u201cBUSINESS\u201d SECTION OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR REGULATED UTILITY BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  OUR GOAL IS TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES THAT BENEFIT ALL STAKEHOLDERS AS WE ADDRESS CHANGING CUSTOMER CONSERVATION PATTERNS, DEVELOP MORE CONTEMPORARY PRICING STRUCTURES AND EMBARK ON LONG-TERM INVESTMENT PROGRAMS. THESE STRATEGIES ARE INTENDED TO IMPROVE RELIABILITY AND SAFETY, ENHANCE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND REDUCE EMISSIONS WHILE GENERATING SUSTAINABLE RETURNS. ADDITIONALLY, WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES THAT WILL ALLOW RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS NOT CURRENTLY ON OUR SYSTEM TO OBTAIN GAS SERVICE IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER.  GREATER LAWRENCE INCIDENT.  THE GREATER LAWRENCE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2018. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECORDED A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY  $204 MILLION  FOR THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS AND APPROXIMATELY  $32 MILLION  FOR OTHER INCIDENT-RELATED EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE GREATER LAWRENCE INCIDENT. THE AMOUNTS SET FORTH ABOVE DO NOT INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED CAPITAL COST OF THE PIPELINE REPLACEMENT DESCRIBED BELOW AND AS SET FORTH IN NOTE  17  - D, \"OTHER MATTERS - GREATER LAWRENCE PIPELINE REPLACEMENT,\" IN THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED).  INCLUDING THE $757 MILLION RECORDED DURING 2018, WE ESTIMATE THAT TOTAL COSTS RELATED TO THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS AS SET FORTH IN NOTE 17, \"OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES - B. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,\" WILL RANGE FROM  $961 MILLION  TO  $1,010 MILLION  , DEPENDING ON THE FINAL OUTCOME OF ONGOING REVIEWS AND THE NUMBER, NATURE AND VALUE OF THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR A TOTAL OF  $360 MILLION  TO  $370 MILLION  IN OTHER INCIDENT-RELATED COSTS, INCLUSIVE OF THE $266 MILLION RECORDED DURING 2018.  WE ALSO EXPECT TO INCUR EXPENSES FOR WHICH WE CANNOT ESTIMATE THE AMOUNTS OF OR THE TIMING AT THIS TIME, INCLUDING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS AND FINES, PENALTIES OR SETTLEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE GREATER LAWRENCE INCIDENT.  COLUMBIA OF MASSACHUSETTS RECORDED  $100 MILLION  TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 IN ADDITION TO THE $135 MILLION RECORDED DURING 2018. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019,  $113 MILLION  HAD BEEN COLLECTED, OF WHICH  $108 MILLION  WAS COLLECTED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. ADDITIONAL COLLECTIONS OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS IN THE AMOUNT OF  $22 MILLION  WERE RECEIVED SUBSEQUENT TO THE MARCH 31, 2019 BALANCE SHEET DATE. WE ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO PREDICT THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FUTURE INSURANCE RECOVERIES. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN COLLECTING REIMBURSEMENT IN THE AMOUNT RECORDED FOR SUCH RECOVERIES AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , IT COULD RESULT IN A CHARGE TO EARNINGS.  SINCE THE GREATER LAWRENCE INCIDENT AND THROUGH MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAVE INCURRED APPROXIMATELY  $177 MILLION  OF CAPITAL SPEND FOR THE PIPELINE REPLACEMENT, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY  $10 MILLION  WAS INCURRED IN 2019. WE ESTIMATE THIS REPLACEMENT WORK WILL COST BETWEEN  $240 MILLION  AND  $250 MILLION  IN TOTAL. COLUMBIA OF MASSACHUSETTS HAS PROVIDED NOTICE TO ITS PROPERTY INSURER OF THE GREATER LAWRENCE INCIDENT AND DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE CLAIM AND RECOVERY HAVE COMMENCED. THE RECOVERY OF ANY CAPITAL INVESTMENT NOT REIMBURSED THROUGH INSURANCE WILL BE ADDRESSED IN A FUTURE REGULATORY PROCEEDING. THE OUTCOME OF SUCH A PROCEEDING IS UNCERTAIN. IF AT ANY POINT COLUMBIA OF MASSACHUSETTS CONCLUDES IT IS PROBABLE THAT ANY PORTION OF THIS CAPITAL INVESTMENT IS NOT RECOVERABLE THROUGH CUSTOMER RATES, THAT PORTION OF THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT, IF ESTIMABLE, WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY CHARGED TO EARNINGS.  REFER TO NOTE  17  -B AND D, \"LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\" AND \"OTHER MATTERS,\" IN THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED), \"SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS,\" \"RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT OPERATION - GAS DISTRIBUTION  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  NISOURCE INC.  OPERATIONS,\" AND \"LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\" IN THIS MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE GREATER LAWRENCE INCIDENT.  SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS  OUR OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY THE COST OF SALES. COST OF SALES FOR THE GAS DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS SEGMENT IS PRINCIPALLY COMPRISED OF THE COST OF NATURAL GAS USED WHILE PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS. COST OF SALES FOR THE ELECTRIC OPERATIONS SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF THE COST OF COAL, RELATED HANDLING COSTS, NATURAL GAS PURCHASED FOR THE INTERNAL GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY AT NIPSCO AND THE COST OF POWER PURCHASED FROM THIRD-PARTY GENERATORS OF ELECTRICITY.  THE MAJORITY OF THE COST OF SALES ARE TRACKED COSTS THAT ARE PASSED THROUGH DIRECTLY TO THE CUSTOMER, RESULTING IN AN EQUAL AND OFFSETTING AMOUNT REFLECTED IN OPERATING REVENUES. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE NET REVENUES, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE DEFINED AS OPERATING REVENUES LESS COST OF SALES (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION), PROVIDES MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS A USEFUL MEASURE TO ANALYZE PROFITABILITY. THE PRESENTATION OF NET REVENUES HEREIN IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION FOR INVESTORS REGARDING OPERATING PERFORMANCE. NET REVENUES DO NOT INTEND TO REPRESENT OPERATING INCOME, THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE, AS AN INDICATOR OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , OPERATING INCOME AND A RECONCILIATION OF NET REVENUES TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE, OPERATING INCOME, WAS AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  (IN MILLIONS)  2019  2018  2019 VS. 2018  OPERATING INCOME  $374.2  $400.6  $(26.4  )  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  2019  2018  2019 VS. 2018  OPERATING REVENUES  $1,869.8  $1,750.8  $119.0  COST OF SALES (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION)  680.3  724.4  (44.1  )  TOTAL NET REVENUES  1,189.5  1,026.4  163.1  OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES  815.3  625.8  189.5  OPERATING INCOME  374.2  400.6  (26.4  )  TOTAL OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET  (96.3  )  (61.8  )  (34.5  )  INCOME TAXES  59.0  62.7  (3.7  )  NET INCOME  218.9  276.1  (57.2  )  PREFERRED DIVIDENDS  (13.8  )  \u2014  (13.8  )  NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS  205.1  276.1  (71.0  )  BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE  $0.55  $0.82  $(0.27  )  BASIC AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING  373.4  338.0  35.4  ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, WE REPORTED NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF  $205.1 MILLION  , OR  $0.55  PER BASIC SHARE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS OF  $276.1 MILLION  , OR  $0.82  PER BASIC SHARE FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . THE DECREASE IN INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS DURING  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GREATER OPERATING EXPENSES RELATED TO THE GREATER LAWRENCE INCIDENT, AN INTEREST RATE SWAP SETTLEMENT GAIN IN 2018 AND DILUTION RESULTING FROM PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDEND COMMITMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEW RATES FROM BASE RATE PROCEEDINGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS.

REFER TO NOTE 2, \"RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS,\" FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES  RISK IS AN INHERENT PART OF OUR BUSINESSES. THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE PROPERLY AND EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY, ASSESS, MONITOR AND MANAGE EACH OF THE VARIOUS TYPES OF RISK INVOLVED IN OUR BUSINESSES IS CRITICAL TO OUR PROFITABILITY. WE SEEK TO IDENTIFY, ASSESS, MONITOR AND MANAGE, IN ACCORDANCE WITH DEFINED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPAL MARKET RISKS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN OUR BUSINESSES: COMMODITY PRICE RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK. RISK MANAGEMENT FOR US IS A MULTI-FACETED PROCESS WITH OVERSIGHT BY THE RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE THAT REQUIRES CONSTANT COMMUNICATION, JUDGMENT AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIALIZED PRODUCTS AND MARKETS. OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TAKES AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS AND HAS DEVELOPED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT REQUIRE SPECIFIC ADMINISTRATIVE AND BUSINESS FUNCTIONS TO ASSIST IN THE IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT AND CONTROL OF VARIOUS RISKS. THESE MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO MARKET, OPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL, COMPLIANCE AND STRATEGIC RISK TYPES. IN RECOGNITION OF THE INCREASINGLY VARIED AND COMPLEX NATURE OF THE ENERGY BUSINESS, OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, POLICIES AND PROCEDURES CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND ARE SUBJECT TO ONGOING REVIEW AND MODIFICATION.  COMMODITY PRICE RISK  WE ARE EXPOSED TO COMMODITY PRICE RISK AS A RESULT OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 OPERATIONS INVOLVING NATURAL GAS AND POWER. TO MANAGE THIS MARKET RISK, OUR SUBSIDIARIES USE DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING COMMODITY FUTURES CONTRACTS, SWAPS, FORWARDS AND OPTIONS. WE DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN SPECULATIVE ENERGY TRADING ACTIVITY.  COMMODITY PRICE RISK RESULTING FROM DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AT OUR RATE-REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES IS LIMITED, SINCE REGULATIONS ALLOW RECOVERY OF PRUDENTLY INCURRED PURCHASED POWER, FUEL AND GAS COSTS THROUGH THE RATEMAKING PROCESS, INCLUDING GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. IF STATES SHOULD EXPLORE ADDITIONAL REGULATORY REFORM, THESE SUBSIDIARIES MAY BEGIN PROVIDING SERVICES WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF THE TRADITIONAL RATEMAKING PROCESS AND MAY BE MORE EXPOSED TO COMMODITY PRICE RISK.  OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE CASH MARGIN DEPOSITS WITH THEIR BROKERS TO COVER ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL LOSSES IN THE VALUE OF OUTSTANDING EXCHANGE TRADED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE AMOUNT OF THESE DEPOSITS, SOME OF WHICH IS REFLECTED IN OUR RESTRICTED CASH BALANCE, MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY DURING PERIODS OF HIGH VOLATILITY IN THE ENERGY COMMODITY MARKETS.  REFER TO NOTE  8  , \"RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES,\" IN THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON OUR COMMODITY PRICE RISK ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  OR  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  INTEREST RATE RISK  WE ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ON BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT, COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS AND TERM LOAN, WHICH HAVE INTEREST RATES THAT ARE INDEXED TO SHORT-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES. BASED UPON AVERAGE BORROWINGS AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN SHORT-TERM MARKET INTEREST RATES, AN INCREASE (OR DECREASE) IN SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES OF 100 BASIS POINTS (1%) WOULD HAVE INCREASED (OR DECREASED) INTEREST EXPENSE BY  $4.9 MILLION  AND  $3.0 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. WE ARE ALSO EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN BENCHMARK RATES THAT CAN INFLUENCE THE INTEREST RATES OF FUTURE DEBT ISSUANCES.  REFER TO NOTE  8  , \"RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES,\" IN THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON OUR INTEREST RATE RISK ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  50  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  NISOURCE INC.  CREDIT RISK  DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY, CREDIT RISK IS EMBEDDED IN MANY OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. OUR EXTENSION OF CREDIT IS GOVERNED BY A CORPORATE CREDIT RISK POLICY. IN ADDITION, RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE GUIDELINES ARE IN PLACE WHICH DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT APPROVAL LEVELS FOR CREDIT LIMITS, EVALUATION OF CREDITWORTHINESS, AND CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EFFORTS. EXPOSURES TO CREDIT RISKS ARE MONITORED BY THE RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION WHICH IS INDEPENDENT OF COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS. CREDIT RISK ARISES DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT A CUSTOMER, SUPPLIER OR COUNTERPARTY WILL NOT BE ABLE OR WILLING TO FULFILL ITS OBLIGATIONS ON A TRANSACTION ON OR BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT DATE. FOR DERIVATIVE-RELATED CONTRACTS, CREDIT RISK ARISES WHEN COUNTERPARTIES ARE OBLIGATED TO DELIVER OR PURCHASE DEFINED COMMODITY UNITS OF GAS OR POWER TO US AT A FUTURE DATE PER EXECUTION OF CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS. EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK IS MEASURED IN TERMS OF BOTH CURRENT OBLIGATIONS AND THE MARKET VALUE OF FORWARD POSITIONS NET OF ANY POSTED COLLATERAL SUCH AS CASH AND LETTERS OF CREDIT.  WE CLOSELY MONITOR THE FINANCIAL STATUS OF OUR BANKING CREDIT PROVIDERS. WE EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL STATUS OF OUR BANKING PARTNERS THROUGH THE USE OF MARKET-BASED METRICS SUCH AS CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP PRICING LEVELS, AND ALSO THROUGH TRADITIONAL CREDIT RATINGS PROVIDED BY MAJOR CREDIT RATING AGENCIES.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH OUR UNAUDITED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.  UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, THE FIGURES IN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS ARE UNAUDITED.  OVERVIEW  GLOBUS MEDICAL, INC. (TOGETHER, AS APPLICABLE, WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, \u201cGLOBUS,\u201d \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cUS\u201d OR \u201cOUR\u201d), HEADQUARTERED IN AUDUBON, PENNSYLVANIA, IS A MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANY THAT DEVELOPS AND COMMERCIALIZES HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS WHOSE MISSION IS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS. FOUNDED IN 2003, GLOBUS IS COMMITTED TO MEDICAL DEVICE INNOVATION AND DELIVERING EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE TO HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIANS TO ADVANCE PATIENT CARE AND IMPROVE EFFICIENCY. SINCE INCEPTION, GLOBUS HAS LISTENED TO THE VOICE OF THE SURGEON TO DEVELOP PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS AND PRODUCTS TO HELP SURGEONS EFFECTIVELY TREAT PATIENTS AND IMPROVE LIVES.  WITH OVER  190  PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET, WE OFFER A COMPREHENSIVE PORTFOLIO OF INNOVATIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED TECHNOLOGIES THAT TREAT A VARIETY OF MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS OF THE SPINE, EXTREMITIES AND PELVIS.  ALTHOUGH WE MANAGE OUR BUSINESS GLOBALLY WITHIN ONE OPERATING SEGMENT, WE SEPARATE OUR PRODUCTS INTO TWO MAJOR CATEGORIES: MUSCULOSKELETAL SOLUTIONS AND ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES.  MUSCULOSKELETAL SOLUTIONS  MUSCULOSKELETAL SOLUTIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF IMPLANTABLE DEVICES, BIOLOGICS, ACCESSORIES, AND UNIQUE SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS USED IN AN EXPANSIVE RANGE OF SPINAL, ORTHOPEDIC AND NEUROSURGICAL PROCEDURES.  OUR BROAD SPECTRUM OF SPINE PRODUCTS ADDRESSES THE VAST MAJORITY OF CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE SPINE INCLUDING DEGENERATIVE CONDITIONS, DEFORMITY, TUMORS, AND TRAUMA. WITH MORE THAN FIFTEEN YEARS IN THIS COMPETITIVE MARKET, WE PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS THAT FACILITATE BOTH OPEN AND MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGERY (\u201cMIS\u201d) TECHNIQUES. THIS INCLUDES TRADITIONAL FUSION IMPLANTS SUCH AS PEDICLE SCREW AND ROD SYSTEMS, PLATING SYSTEMS, INTERVERTEBRAL SPACERS AND CORPECTOMY DEVICES. WE BELIEVE WE PIONEERED INNOVATIVE EXPANDABLE SOLUTIONS FOR INTERBODY FUSION, CORPECTOMY AND INTERSPINOUS FIXATION THAT ALLOW INTRAOPERATIVE CUSTOMIZATION OF OUR DEVICES TO THE PATIENT\u2019S ANATOMY AND SAVE SURGICAL TIME BY ELIMINATING SEQUENTIAL TRIALING. WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR MOTION PRESERVATION TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS DYNAMIC STABILIZATION, TOTAL DISC REPLACEMENT AND INTERSPINOUS DISTRACTION DEVICES; AND INTERVENTIONAL PAIN MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS TO TREAT VERTEBRAL COMPRESSION FRACTURES. REGENERATIVE BIOLOGIC PRODUCTS SUCH AS ALLOGRAFTS AND SYNTHETIC ALTERNATIVES ARE ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENTS TYPICALLY USED IN COMBINATION WITH STABILIZING IMPLANT HARDWARE.  OUR ORTHOPEDIC TRAUMA SOLUTIONS ARE DESIGNED TO TREAT A WIDE VARIETY OF ORTHOPEDIC FRACTURE PATTERNS AND PATIENT ANATOMIES IN THE UPPER AND LOWER EXTREMITIES AS WELL AS THE HIP.  TO DATE, GLOBUS HAS RECEIVED 510(K) CLEARANCE FROM THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) FOR NUMEROUS ORTHOPEDIC TRAUMA AND EXTREMITY PRODUCTS, COVERING FOUR MAJOR SEGMENTS OF THE ORTHOPEDIC TRAUMA MARKET - FRACTURE PLATES, COMPRESSION SCREWS, INTRAMEDULLARY NAILS, AND EXTERNAL FIXATION.  WE BEGAN MARKETING THESE PRODUCTS IN 2018 AND INTEND TO GROW OUR PRESENCE IN THIS FIELD. FRACTURE PLATING INCLUDES PROXIMAL HUMERUS, DISTAL RADIUS, PROXIMAL TIBIA, DISTAL FIBULA, SMALL FRAGMENT, MINI-FRAGMENT AND CLAVICLE PLATES.  INTRAMEDULLARY NAILING INCLUDES TIBIAL, TROCHANTERIC, AND FEMORAL NAIL SYSTEMS.  REGENERATIVE BIOLOGIC PRODUCTS SUCH AS BONE VOID FILLERS AND ALLOGRAFT STRUTS ARE ALSO USED IN ORTHOPEDIC PROCEDURES WHERE APPLICABLE.  ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES ARE ADVANCED COMPUTER-ASSISTED INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO ENHANCE A SURGEON\u2019S CAPABILITIES AND STREAMLINE SURGICAL PROCEDURES TO BE SAFER, LESS INVASIVE, MORE ACCURATE, AND MORE REPRODUCIBLE, TO ULTIMATELY IMPROVE PATIENT CARE AND REDUCE RADIATION EXPOSURE FOR ALL INVOLVED.  OUR CURRENT ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES ARE COMPRISED OF IMAGING, NAVIGATION AND ROBOTIC (\u201cINR\u201d) ASSISTED SURGERY SOLUTIONS. THIS INCLUDES THE EXCELSIUSGPS  \u00ae  PLATFORM, A ROBOTIC GUIDANCE AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS MINIMALLY INVASIVE AND OPEN PROCEDURES WITH SCREW PLACEMENT APPLICATIONS.  THE EXCELSIUSGPS  \u00ae  PLATFORM HAS A MODULAR DESIGN THAT CAN BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF SCREW PLACEMENT APPLICATIONS, AND WE EXPECT THAT IT WILL SERVE AS A FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE CLINICAL APPLICATIONS USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND AUGMENTED REALITY.  GLOBUS\u2019 INNOVATIVE ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES PRODUCTS OFFER SURGEONS MORE INFORMATION ABOUT PATIENT ANATOMY AND SURGICAL OPTIONS TO HELP THEM TO MAKE WELL-INFORMED SURGICAL DECISIONS.  WE BELIEVE THE ADVANTAGES OF PRE-PLANNING IMPLANT POSITION AND VIEWING PATIENT ANATOMY DURING SURGERY ARE SELF-EVIDENT, AND ALSO CREATE SIGNIFICANT SECONDARY GAINS SUCH AS ELIMINATING RADIATION EXPOSURE ALTOGETHER.  WHILE WE GROUP OUR PRODUCTS INTO TWO CATEGORIES, THEY ARE NOT LIMITED TO A PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY, PLATFORM OR SURGICAL APPROACH. INSTEAD, OUR GOAL IS TO OFFER A COMPREHENSIVE PRODUCT SUITE THAT CAN BE USED TO EFFECTIVELY TREAT PATIENTS BASED ON THEIR SPECIFIC ANATOMY AND CONDITION, AND IS CUSTOMIZED TO THE SURGEON\u2019S TRAINING AND SURGICAL PREFERENCE.  TO DATE, THE PRIMARY MARKET FOR OUR PRODUCTS HAS BEEN THE UNITED STATES, WHERE WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DIRECT SALES REPRESENTATIVES EMPLOYED BY US AND DISTRIBUTOR SALES REPRESENTATIVES EMPLOYED BY OUR EXCLUSIVE INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, WHO DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS ON OUR BEHALF FOR A COMMISSION THAT IS GENERALLY BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF SALES. WE BELIEVE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHEN OUR POSITION IN THE U.S. MARKET BY INCREASING THE SIZE OF OUR U.S. SALES FORCE AND WE INTEND TO ADD ADDITIONAL DIRECT AND DISTRIBUTOR SALES REPRESENTATIVES IN THE FUTURE.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY  19%  OF OUR TOTAL SALES.  WE HAVE SOLD OUR PRODUCTS IN APPROXIMATELY  50  COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DIRECT SALES REPRESENTATIVES EMPLOYED BY US AND EXCLUSIVE INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTORS. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO INCREASE OUR PRESENCE IN BOTH EXISTING AND NEW INTERNATIONAL MARKETS THROUGH THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF OUR DIRECT AND DISTRIBUTOR SALES FORCES AND THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  SALES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH, FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED, OUR SALES BY GEOGRAPHY EXPRESSED AS DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND THE CHANGES IN SALES BETWEEN THE SPECIFIED PERIODS EXPRESSED IN DOLLAR AMOUNTS AND AS PERCENTAGES.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  TO SUPPLEMENT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), MANAGEMENT USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  FOR EXAMPLE, NON-GAAP ADJUSTED EBITDA, WHICH REPRESENTS NET INCOME BEFORE INTEREST INCOME, NET AND OTHER NON-OPERATING EXPENSES, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, PROVISION FOR LITIGATION, ACQUISITION RELATED COSTS/LICENSING, AND NET GAIN FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS, IS USEFUL AS AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND PARTICULARLY AS A MEASURE OF COMPARATIVE OPERATING PERFORMANCE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, AS IT IS REFLECTIVE OF CHANGES IN PRICING DECISIONS, COST CONTROLS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND IT REMOVES THE EFFECT OF OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE, ASSET BASE, INCOME TAXES AND INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE.  OUR MANAGEMENT ALSO USES NON-GAAP ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE PREPARATION OF OUR ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGET AND FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS.  PROVISION FOR LITIGATION REPRESENTS COSTS INCURRED FOR LITIGATION SETTLEMENTS OR UNFAVORABLE VERDICTS WHEN THE LOSS IS KNOWN OR CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, OR IN THE CASE OF A FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT, WHEN INCOME IS REALIZED.  ACQUISITION RELATED COSTS/LICENSING REPRESENTS THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF BUSINESS-ACQUISITION-RELATED CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION; COSTS RELATED TO INTEGRATING RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO COSTS TO EXIT OR CONVERT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, SEVERANCE, AND INFORMATION SYSTEM CONVERSION; AND SPECIFIC COSTS RELATED TO THE CONSUMMATION OF THE ACQUISITION PROCESS SUCH AS BANKER FEES, LEGAL FEES, AND OTHER ACQUISITION-RELATED PROFESSIONAL FEES, AS WELL AS ONE-TIME LICENSING FEES.  NET GAIN FROM SALE OF ASSETS REPRESENTS THE GAIN ON SALE OF ASSETS AND THE OFFSETTING IMPACT OF COSTS INCURRED THROUGH THE SALE.  THE FOLLOWING IS A RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

THE TAX IMPACT OF THESE NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE CONSOLIDATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON A GAAP BASIS, APPLIED TO THE NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS, UNLESS THE UNDERLYING ITEM HAS A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT TAX TREATMENT, IN WHICH CASE THE ESTIMATED TAX RATE APPLICABLE TO THE ADJUSTMENT IS USED.  WE BELIEVE THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE ALSO USEFUL INDICATORS OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND PARTICULARLY AS ADDITIONAL MEASURES OF COMPARATIVE OPERATING PERFORMANCE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AS THEY REMOVE THE EFFECTS OF LITIGATION, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, ACQUISITION RELATED COSTS/LICENSING, AND THE TAX EFFECTS OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS.

CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE INCREASE IN NET IMPACT OF PURCHASES, MATURITIES AND SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED PURCHASES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS THE RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM OPTION EXERCISES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CURRENT PERIOD CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION PAYMENT.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE HIGHLIGHTS CERTAIN INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.

IN  JUNE 2018  , WE AMENDED THE CREDIT AGREEMENT TO INCREASE THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AMOUNT FROM  $50.0 MILLION  TO  $125.0 MILLION  .  AT OUR REQUEST, AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE BANK, THE AMOUNT OF BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CAN BE INCREASED TO  $150.0 MILLION  . THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY INCLUDES UP TO A  $25.0 MILLION  SUB-LIMIT FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT.  AS AMENDED TO DATE, THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY EXPIRES IN MAY 2019. CASH ADVANCES BEAR INTEREST AT OUR OPTION EITHER AT A FLUCTUATING RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO THE DAILY  LIBOR  IN EFFECT FOR A  ONE  -MONTH PERIOD PLUS  0.75%  , OR A FIXED RATE FOR A  ONE  - OR  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD EQUAL TO  LIBOR  PLUS  0.75%  . THE CREDIT AGREEMENT GOVERNING THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ALSO SUBJECTS US TO VARIOUS RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS, INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE. THE COVENANTS ALSO INCLUDE LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO REPURCHASE SHARES, TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS OR TO ENTER INTO A SALE TRANSACTION. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THERE WERE  NO  OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS WERE  $125.0 MILLION  . WE MAY TERMINATE THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME ON  TEN  DAYS\u2019 NOTICE WITHOUT PREMIUM OR PENALTY.  IN ADDITION TO OUR EXISTING CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES, OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH WAS FULLY AVAILABLE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  . WE BELIEVE THESE SOURCES WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY FOR US TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. OUR PRINCIPAL LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ARE TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING CLINICAL TRIALS, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE NEEDS, PRINCIPALLY FOR OUR SURGICAL SETS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND OUR BUSINESS AND POTENTIAL FUTURE BUSINESS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN SURGICAL SETS AS WE LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS, INCREASE THE SIZE OF OUR U.S. SALES FORCE, AND EXPAND INTO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. WE MAY, HOWEVER, REQUIRE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY AS WE CONTINUE TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF A DECLINE IN SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING DECLINES DUE TO CHANGES IN OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 ABILITY TO OBTAIN THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROCEDURES THAT USE OUR PRODUCTS, INCREASED PRICING PRESSURES RESULTING FROM INTENSIFYING COMPETITION, COST INCREASES AND SLOWER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CYCLES RESULTING FROM A CHANGING REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT; AND UNFAVORABLE RESULTS FROM LITIGATION WHICH WILL AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW. WE ANTICIPATE THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE REQUIRE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY, IT WILL BE FUNDED THROUGH THE INCURRENCE OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS, ADDITIONAL EQUITY FINANCINGS OR A COMBINATION OF THESE POTENTIAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY MAY RESULT IN DILUTION TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE SUCH ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR AT ALL.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SEASONALITY AND BACKLOG  OUR BUSINESS IS GENERALLY NOT SEASONAL IN NATURE. HOWEVER, OUR SALES OF MUSCULOSKELETAL SOLUTIONS PRODUCTS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY SUMMER VACATION AND WINTER HOLIDAY PERIODS DURING WHICH WE HAVE EXPERIENCED FEWER SURGERIES TAKING PLACE, AS WELL AS MORE SURGERIES TAKING PLACE LATER IN THE YEAR WHEN PATIENTS HAVE MET THE DEDUCTIBLES UNDER INSURANCE PLANS. OUR SALES OF ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES PRODUCTS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY LONGER CAPITAL PURCHASE CYCLES AND THE TIMING OF BUDGET APPROVALS FOR MAJOR CAPITAL PURCHASES.  WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR SUPPLIERS TO ENSURE THAT OUR INVENTORY NEEDS ARE MET WHILE MAINTAINING HIGH QUALITY AND RELIABILITY. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTY IN LOCATING AND OBTAINING THE MATERIALS NECESSARY TO FULFILL OUR PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS, AND WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED A MEANINGFUL BACKLOG OF SALES ORDERS.

OTHER INCOME  INCREASED $288 MILLION, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN NET INVESTMENT EARNINGS ON NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING TRUST FUNDS.  INTEREST AND RELATED CHARGES  INCREASED 49%, PRIMARILY DUE TO DEBT ACQUIRED IN THE SCANA COMBINATION ($93 MILLION), THE ABSENCE OF CAPITALIZATION OF INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIQUEFACTION FACILITY UPON COMPLETION OF CONSTRUCTION ($42 MILLION) AND HIGHER LONG-TERM DEBT INTEREST EXPENSE RESULTING FROM NET DEBT ISSUANCES IN 2018 ($19 MILLION).  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  DECREASED 16%, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PRE-TAX INCOME ($220 MILLION), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A CHARGE FOR CERTAIN INCOME TAX-RELATED REGULATORY ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THE SCANA COMBINATION FOR WHICH DOMINION ENERGY COMMITTED TO FORGO RECOVERY ($198 MILLION).  NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  DECREASED $20 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN DOMINION ENERGY MIDSTREAM IN JANUARY 2019.

OTHER OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE  DECREASED 30%, PRIMARILY REFLECTING.  \u2022  A BENEFIT FROM THE REVISION OF FUTURE ASH POND AND LANDFILL CLOSURE COSTS AS A RESULT OF VIRGINIA LEGISLATION ENACTED IN MARCH 2019 ($113 MILLION);  \u2022  A $25 MILLION DECREASE IN STORM DAMAGE AND SERVICE RESTORATION COSTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF WINTER STORM RILEY ($31 MILLION);  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  \u2022  A $10 MILLION INCREASE IN CERTAIN  ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION-RELATED EXPENDITURES. THESE EXPENSES ARE PRIMARILY RECOVERED THROUGH STATE AND FERC RATES AND DO NOT IMPACT NET INCOME.  IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS AND OTHER CHARGES  INCREASED $546 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $368 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE EARLY RETIREMENT OF CERTAIN ELECTRIC GENERATION FACILITIES, A $160 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE PLANNED EARLY RETIREMENT OF CERTAIN AUTOMATED METER READING INFRASTRUCTURE AND A $17 MILLION CHARGE TO WRITE-OFF THE BALANCE OF A REGULATORY ASSET FOR WHICH VIRGINIA POWER IS NO LONGER SEEKING RECOVERY.  OTHER INCOME  INCREASED $34 MILLION, PRIMARILY REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN NET INVESTMENT EARNINGS ON NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING TRUST FUNDS.  101  INCOME TAX  EXPENSE  DECREASED 92%, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PRE-TAX INCOME.

OTHER OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE  DECREASED 4%, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A DECREASE IN SERVICES PERFORMED FOR ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE. THESE EXPENSES ARE BILLED TO ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE AND DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT NET INCOME.  GAINS ON SALES OF ASSETS  DECREASED $44 MILLION DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF GAINS RELATED TO AGREEMENTS TO CONVEY SHALE DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS UNDER NATURAL GAS STORAGE FIELDS.  102  EARNINGS FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTEE  DECREASED 33%, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER EARNINGS FROM UNSUBSCRIBED CAPACITY AS A RESULT OF A DECREASE IN HEATING DEGREE DAYS AT IROQUOIS.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  DECREASED 35%, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PRE-TAX INCOME.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  DOMINION ENERGY DEPENDS ON BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY TO PROVIDE WORKING CAPITAL AND AS A BRIDGE TO LONG-TERM DEBT FINANCINGS. SHORT-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS NOT MET BY CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS ARE GENERALLY SATISFIED WITH PROCEEDS FROM SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. LONG-TERM CASH NEEDS ARE MET THROUGH ISSUANCES OF DEBT AND/OR EQUITY SECURITIES.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, DOMINION ENERGY HAD $3.5 BILLION OF UNUSED CAPACITY UNDER ITS CREDIT FACILITY. SEE NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION.  A SUMMARY OF DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S CASH FLOWS IS PRESENTED BELOW.  2019  2018  (MILLIONS)  CASH, RESTRICTED CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AT JANUARY 1  $391  $185  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY (USED IN).

DOMINION ENERGY BELIEVES THAT ITS OPERATIONS PROVIDE A STABLE SOURCE OF CASH FLOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO PLANNED LEVELS OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND MAINTAIN OR GROW THE DIVIDEND ON COMMON SHARES.  DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE TIMING OR AMOUNTS OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  CREDIT RISK  DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK RESULTS PRIMARILY FROM ITS ENERGY MARKETING AND PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. PRESENTED BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S CREDIT EXPOSURE AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 FOR THESE ACTIVITIES. GROSS CREDIT EXPOSURE FOR EACH COUNTERPARTY IS CALCULATED PRIOR TO THE APPLICATION OF COLLATERAL AND REPRESENTS OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES PLUS ANY UNREALIZED ON- OR OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURE, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT CONTRACTUAL NETTING RIGHTS.

THE FIVE LARGEST COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURES, COMBINED, FOR THIS CATEGORY REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 43%  OF THE TOTAL NET CREDIT EXPOSURE.  (2)  THE FIVE LARGEST COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURES, COMBINED, FOR THIS CATEGORY REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 6% OF THE TOTAL NET CREDIT EXPOSURE.  103  (3)  THE FIVE LARGEST COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURES, COMBINED, FOR THIS CATEGORY  REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE TOTAL NET CREDIT EXPOSURE.  (4)  THE FIVE LARGEST COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURES, COMBINED, FOR THIS CATEGORY REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 25% OF THE TOTAL NET CREDIT EXPOSURE.  INVESTING CASH FLOWS  NET CASH USED IN DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $631 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH ACQUIRED IN THE SCANA COMBINATION, PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF BLUE RACER AND A DECREASE IN PLANT CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER PROPERTY ADDITIONS.  FINANCING CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY  DOMINION ENERGY RELIES ON CAPITAL MARKETS AS SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS NOT SATISFIED BY CASH PROVIDED BY ITS OPERATIONS. AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN  CREDIT RATINGS  AND  DEBT COVENANTS  IN MD&A IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE ABILITY TO BORROW FUNDS OR ISSUE SECURITIES AND THE RETURN DEMANDED BY INVESTORS ARE AFFECTED BY CREDIT RATINGS. IN ADDITION, THE RAISING OF EXTERNAL CAPITAL IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING REGISTRATION WITH THE SEC FOR CERTAIN ISSUANCES.  DOMINION ENERGY CURRENTLY MEETS THE DEFINITION OF A WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER UNDER SEC RULES GOVERNING THE REGISTRATION, COMMUNICATIONS AND OFFERING PROCESSES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED. THE RULES PROVIDE FOR A STREAMLINED SHELF REGISTRATION PROCESS TO PROVIDE REGISTRANTS WITH TIMELY ACCESS TO CAPITAL. THIS ALLOWS DOMINION ENERGY TO USE AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENTS TO REGISTER ANY OFFERING OF SECURITIES, OTHER THAN THOSE FOR EXCHANGE OFFERS OR BUSINESS COMBINATION TRANSACTIONS.  NET CASH USED BY DOMINION ENERGY'S FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $383 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $100 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK AND HIGHER COMMON DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.  IN NOVEMBER 2017, DOMINION ENERGY FILED AN SEC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SALE OF UP TO $3.0 BILLION OF VARIABLE DENOMINATION FLOATING RATE DEMAND NOTES, CALLED DOMINION ENERGY RELIABILITY INVESTMENT  SM  . THE REGISTRATION LIMITS THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT THAT MAY BE OUTSTANDING AT ANY ONE TIME TO $1.0 BILLION. THE NOTES ARE OFFERED ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS AND BEAR INTEREST AT A FLOATING RATE PER ANNUM DETERMINED BY THE DOMINION ENERGY RELIABILITY INVESTMENT COMMITTEE, OR ITS DESIGNEE, ON A WEEKLY BASIS. THE NOTES HAVE NO STATED MATURITY DATE, ARE NON-TRANSFERABLE AND MAY BE REDEEMED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY DOMINION ENERGY OR AT THE INVESTOR\u2019S OPTION AT ANY TIME. THE BALANCE AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $19 MILLION. THE NOTES ARE SHORT-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS ON DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE PROCEEDS WILL BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES AND TO REPAY DEBT.  IN JANUARY 2019, DOMINION ENERGY ACQUIRED ALL OUTSTANDING PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS OF DOMINION ENERGY MIDSTREAM NOT OWNED BY DOMINION ENERGY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF 22.5 MILLION COMMON SHARES. SEE NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  IN JANUARY 2019, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SCANA COMBINATION, DOMINION ENERGY ISSUED 95.6 MILLION SHARES OF DOMINION ENERGY COMMON STOCK, VALUED AT $6.8 BILLION, REPRESENTING 0.6690 OF A SHARE OF DOMINION ENERGY COMMON STOCK FOR EACH SHARE OF SCANA COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING AT CLOSING. SCANA\u2019S OUTSTANDING DEBT TOTALED $6.9 BILLION AT CLOSING.  SEE NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S CREDIT FACILITIES, LIQUIDITY AND SIGNIFICANT FINANCING TRANSACTIONS.  CREDIT RATINGS  CREDIT RATINGS ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE BANKS AND CAPITAL MARKET PARTICIPANTS WITH A FRAMEWORK FOR COMPARING THE CREDIT QUALITY OF SECURITIES AND ARE NOT A RECOMMENDATION TO BUY, SELL OR HOLD SECURITIES. IN THE  CREDIT RATINGS  SECTION OF MD&A IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THERE IS A DISCUSSION ON THE USE OF CAPITAL MARKETS BY DOMINION ENERGY AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF CREDIT RATINGS ON THE ACCESSIBILITY AND COSTS OF USING THESE MARKETS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S CREDIT RATINGS.  DEBT COVENANTS  IN THE  DEBT COVENANTS  SECTION OF MD&A IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THERE IS A DISCUSSION ON THE VARIOUS COVENANTS PRESENT IN THE ENABLING AGREEMENTS UNDERLYING DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S DEBT. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO DEBT COVENANTS, NOR ANY EVENTS OF DEFAULT UNDER DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S DEBT COVENANTS.  104  FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS FOR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS NOR ANY MATERIAL CHANGES TO PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS DISCLOSED IN MD&A IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  USE OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS DISCLOSED IN MD&A IN THE COMPANIES' ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  FUTURE ISSUES AND OTHER MATTERS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF FUTURE ISSUES AND OTHER INFORMATION INCLUDES CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS OF PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED MATTERS AND NEW ISSUES ARISING DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY, AND SUBSEQUENT TO, THE DATES OF DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT MAY IMPACT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND/OR CASH FLOWS. THIS SECTION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH  ITEM 1. BUSINESS  AND  FUTURE ISSUES AND OTHER MATTERS  IN MD&A IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  DOMINION ENERGY IS SUBJECT TO COSTS RESULTING FROM A NUMBER OF FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS DESIGNED TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECT FUTURE PLANNING AND EXISTING OPERATIONS. THEY CAN RESULT IN INCREASED CAPITAL, OPERATING AND OTHER COSTS AS A RESULT OF COMPLIANCE, REMEDIATION, CONTAINMENT AND MONITORING OBLIGATIONS. SEE NOTE 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND NOTE 17 IN THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  LEGAL MATTERS  SEE  NOTES 3, 13 AND 22 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE COMPANIES\u2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND NOTES 13 AND 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON VARIOUS LEGAL MATTERS.

ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE  IN SEPTEMBER 2014, DOMINION ENERGY, ALONG WITH DUKE AND SOUTHERN COMPANY GAS, ANNOUNCED THE FORMATION OF ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE. ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE IS FOCUSED ON CONSTRUCTING AN APPROXIMATELY 600-MILE NATURAL GAS PIPELINE RUNNING FROM WEST VIRGINIA THROUGH VIRGINIA TO NORTH CAROLINA. DURING THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2018, A FERC STOP WORK ORDER TOGETHER WITH DELAYS IN OBTAINING PERMITS NECESSARY FOR CONSTRUCTION AND DELAYS IN CONSTRUCTION DUE TO JUDICIAL ACTIONS IMPACTED THE COST AND SCHEDULE FOR THE PROJECT.  AS A RESULT PROJECT COST ESTIMATES HAVE INCREASED FROM BETWEEN $6.0 BILLION TO $6.5 BILLION TO BETWEEN $7.0 BILLION TO $7.5 BILLION, EXCLUDING FINANCING COSTS. ATLANTIC COAST PIPELINE EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE A LATE 2020 IN-SERVICE DATE FOR AT LEAST KEY SEGMENTS OF THE PROJECT, WHILE THE REMAINDER MAY EXTEND INTO EARLY 2021. ALTERNATIVELY, IF IT TAKES LONGER TO RESOLVE THE JUDICIAL ISSUES, SUCH AS THROUGH APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE U.S., FULL IN-SERVICE COULD EXTEND TO THE END OF 2021 WITH TOTAL PROJECT COST ESTIMATED TO INCREASE AN ADDITIONAL $250 MILLION, RESULTING IN TOTAL PROJECT COST ESTIMATES OF $7.25 BILLION TO $7.75 BILLION EXCLUDING FINANCING COSTS. ABNORMAL WEATHER, WORK DELAYS (INCLUDING DUE TO JUDICIAL OR REGULATORY ACTION) AND OTHER CONDITIONS MAY RESULT IN FURTHER COST OR SCHEDULE MODIFICATIONS IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPACT TO DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S CASH FLOWS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  MILLSTONE AGREEMENT  IN NOVEMBER 2017, CONNECTICUT ADOPTED THE ACT CONCERNING ZERO CARBON SOLICITATION AND PROCUREMENT, WHICH ALLOWS NUCLEAR GENERATING FACILITIES TO COMPETE FOR POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS IN A STATE SPONSORED PROCUREMENT FOR ELECTRICITY. IN FEBRUARY 2018,  105  CONNECTICUT REGULATORS RECOMMENDED PURSUING THE PROCUREMENT. IN MAY 2018 MILLSTONE PETITIONED TO BE CONSIDERED AN \u201cEXISTING RESOURCE CONFIRMED AT RISK\u201d AND SUBSEQUENTLY PARTICIPATED IN THE STATE SPONSORED PROCUREMENT FOR ELECTRICITY. BEING CONSIDERED \u201c  AT RISK\u201d ALLOWS THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION TO CONSIDER FACTORS OTHER THAN PRICE, SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS, WHEN EVALUATING DOMINION ENERGY\u2019S BIDS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GENERAL  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PROVIDES INFORMATION ON AWR\u2019S CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS, AND INCLUDES SPECIFIC REFERENCES TO AWR\u2019S INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS AND/OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES (GSWC AND ASUS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES), AND AWR (PARENT) WHERE APPLICABLE.  INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS IS A DISCUSSION OF WATER AND ELECTRIC GROSS MARGINS.  WATER AND ELECTRIC GROSS MARGINS ARE COMPUTED BY SUBTRACTING TOTAL SUPPLY COSTS FROM TOTAL REVENUES.  REGISTRANT USES THESE GROSS MARGINS AS IMPORTANT MEASURES IN EVALUATING ITS OPERATING RESULTS.  REGISTRANT BELIEVES THESE MEASURES ARE USEFUL INTERNAL BENCHMARKS IN EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF GSWC.  THE DISCUSSIONS AND TABLES INCLUDED IN THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS ALSO PRESENT REGISTRANT\u2019S OPERATIONS IN TERMS OF EARNINGS PER SHARE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT.  REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT THE DISCLOSURE OF EARNINGS PER SHARE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH CLARITY SURROUNDING THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS DIFFERENT SERVICES.  REGISTRANT REVIEWS THESE MEASUREMENTS REGULARLY AND COMPARES THEM TO HISTORICAL PERIODS AND TO ITS OPERATING BUDGET.  HOWEVER, THESE MEASURES, WHICH ARE NOT PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\"GAAP\"), MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER ENTITIES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO OPERATING INCOME OR EARNINGS PER SHARE, WHICH ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

WATER AND ELECTRIC SEGMENTS.  GSWC'S REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND CASH FLOWS ARE EARNED PRIMARILY THROUGH DELIVERING POTABLE WATER TO HOMES AND BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE DELIVERY OF ELECTRICITY IN THE BIG BEAR AREA OF SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.  RATES CHARGED TO GSWC CUSTOMERS ARE DETERMINED BY THE CPUC.  THESE RATES ARE INTENDED TO ALLOW RECOVERY OF OPERATING COSTS AND A REASONABLE RATE OF RETURN ON CAPITAL.  GSWC PLANS TO CONTINUE TO SEEK ADDITIONAL RATE INCREASES IN FUTURE YEARS FROM THE CPUC TO RECOVER OPERATING AND SUPPLY COSTS AND RECEIVE REASONABLE RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FUTURE YEARS AT GSWC ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN AT HIGHER LEVELS THAN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.  WHEN NECESSARY, GSWC OBTAINS FUNDS FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND THROUGH BANK BORROWINGS.  PENDING GENERAL RATE CASE FILINGS  .  WATER SEGMENT.  IN JULY 2017, GSWC FILED A GENERAL RATE CASE APPLICATION FOR ITS WATER REGIONS AND THE GENERAL OFFICE.  THE GENERAL RATE CASE WILL DETERMINE NEW WATER RATES FOR THE YEARS 2019 THROUGH 2021.  ON AUGUST 15, 2018, GSWC AND THE CPUC\u2019S PUBLIC ADVOCATES OFFICE FILED A JOINT MOTION TO ADOPT A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE GENERAL RATE CASE.  ON APRIL 8, 2019, THE ASSIGNED ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ISSUED A PROPOSED DECISION (\"PD\") ON THE GENERAL RATE CASE.   THE PD APPROVES THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ADVICE LETTER CAPITAL PROJECTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $20.4 MILLION THAT WERE AGREED TO BY GSWC AND THE CPUC\u2019S PUBLIC ADVOCATES OFFICE IN THE SETTLEMENT.  THE PD DOES NOT EXPLICITLY DISALLOW THESE PROJECTS, BUT INSTEAD INSTRUCTS GSWC TO INCLUDE THESE PROJECTS IN ITS NEXT GENERAL RATE CASE FILING.  AS A RESULT, NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE RECORDED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  RELATED TO THE IMMATERIAL COSTS INCURRED TO DATE FOR THESE PROJECTS.  GSWC AND THE CPUC'S PUBLIC ADVOCATES OFFICE HAVE SEPARATELY FILED THEIR RESPONSE AND COMMENTS TO THE PD, AND BOTH PARTIES DISPUTE THE ALJ'S REJECTION OF THE ADVICE LETTER CAPITAL PROJECTS. AT THIS TIME, GSWC CANNOT PREDICT THE FINAL OUTCOME REGARDING THIS MATTER; HOWEVER, IF THE PD IS APPROVED AS IS, IT WOULD AUTHORIZE GSWC TO INVEST APPROXIMATELY $314.1 MILLION IN CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE OVER THE THREE-YEAR RATE CYCLE, AND WOULD INCREASE THE WATER GROSS MARGIN FOR 2019 BY APPROXIMATELY $7.1 MILLION, ADJUSTED FOR UPDATED INFLATION INDEX VALUES SINCE THE AUGUST SETTLEMENT, AS COMPARED TO THE 2018 ADOPTED WATER GROSS MARGIN.  THE 2019 WATER REVENUE REQUIREMENT IN THE PD HAS BEEN REDUCED TO REFLECT A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $7.0 MILLION IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE, COMPARED TO THE ADOPTED 2018 DEPRECIATION EXPENSE, DUE TO A REDUCTION IN THE OVERALL COMPOSITE DEPRECIATION RATES BASED ON A REVISED STUDY FILED IN THE GENERAL RATE CASE.  THE DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE LOWERS THE WATER GROSS MARGIN, AND IS OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE, RESULTING IN NO IMPACT TO NET EARNINGS. IN ADDITION, THE 2019 WATER REVENUE REQUIREMENT IN THE PD INCLUDES A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $2.2 MILLION FOR EXCESS DEFERRED TAX  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REFUNDS AS A RESULT OF THE 2017 TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\"TAX ACT\"), WHICH HAS A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND ALSO RESULTS IN NO IMPACT TO NET EARNINGS.  HAD DEPRECIATION EXPENSE IN THE PD REMAINED THE SAME AS THE 2018 ADOPTED AMOUNT AND THERE WAS NO EXCESS DEFERRED TAX REFUND THAT LOWERED THE 2019 REVENUE REQUIREMENT, THE WATER GROSS MARGIN FOR 2019 WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $16.3 MILLION.  DUE TO THE DELAY IN RECEIVING A FINAL DECISION BY THE CPUC ON THE WATER GENERAL RATE CASE, BILLED WATER REVENUES FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 WERE BASED ON 2018 ADOPTED RATES.  BASED ON THE PD, HAD NEW RATES BEEN IN PLACE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019, PRETAX INCOME FOR THE WATER SEGMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER BY APPROXIMATELY $4.0 MILLION, OR $0.08 PER SHARE, FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  WHEN APPROVED, THE NEW RATES WILL BE RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY 1, 2019 AND RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE RECORDED ACCORDINGLY.  IN ADDITION, THE PD APPROVES THE RECOVERY OF PREVIOUSLY INCURRED COSTS THAT WERE BEING TRACKED IN CPUC-AUTHORIZED MEMORANDUM ACCOUNTS, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION TO OPERATING EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.0 MILLION, OR $0.02 PER SHARE, IF THE PD IS APPROVED BY THE CPUC.  THE PD ALSO ALLOWS FOR POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL WATER REVENUE INCREASES IN 2020 AND 2021 OF APPROXIMATELY $9.6 MILLION AND $12.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, SUBJECT TO THE RESULTS OF AN EARNINGS TEST AND CHANGES TO THE FORECASTED INFLATIONARY INDEX VALUES.  ELECTRIC SEGMENT.  IN MAY 2017, GSWC FILED ITS ELECTRIC GENERAL RATE CASE APPLICATION WITH THE CPUC TO DETERMINE NEW ELECTRIC RATES FOR THE YEARS 2018 THROUGH 2021.  IN NOVEMBER 2018, GSWC AND THE PUBLIC ADVOCATES OFFICE FILED A JOINT MOTION TO ADOPT A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES RESOLVING ALL ISSUES IN CONNECTION WITH THE GENERAL RATE CASE.  AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SETTLEMENT INCORPORATES A PREVIOUS STIPULATION IN THE CASE, WHICH AUTHORIZES A NEW RETURN ON EQUITY FOR GSWC'S ELECTRIC SEGMENT OF 9.60%, AS COMPARED TO ITS PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED RETURN OF 9.95%.  THE STIPULATION ALSO INCLUDED A CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND DEBT COST THE SAME AS THOSE APPROVED BY THE CPUC IN MARCH 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH GSWC'S WATER SEGMENT COST OF CAPITAL PROCEEDING.   FURTHERMORE, THE SETTLEMENT (I) EXTENDS THE RATE CYCLE BY ONE YEAR (NEW RATES WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR 2018-2022); (II) INCREASES THE ELECTRIC GROSS MARGIN FOR 2018 BY APPROXIMATELY $2.0 MILLION COMPARED TO THE 2017 ADOPTED ELECTRIC GROSS MARGIN, ADJUSTED FOR TAX REFORM; (III) AUTHORIZES BVES TO INVEST APPROXIMATELY $44 MILLION IN CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR 2018-2022, WHICH INCLUDES ALL REQUESTED CAPITAL PROJECTS PLUS AN ADDITIONAL $3 MILLION FOR 2022; AND (IV) INCREASES THE ADOPTED ELECTRIC GROSS MARGIN BY $1.2 MILLION FOR EACH OF THE YEARS 2019 AND 2020, BY $1.1 MILLION IN 2021, AND BY $1.0 MILLION IN 2022 (THE RATE INCREASES FOR 2019 \u2013 2022 ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AN EARNINGS TEST).  BECAUSE OF THE DELAY IN FINALIZING THE ELECTRIC GENERAL RATE CASE, BILLED ELECTRIC REVENUES DURING 2018 AND THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 WERE BASED ON 2017 ADOPTED RATES, PENDING A FINAL DECISION BY THE CPUC IN THIS RATE CASE APPLICATION.  HAD THE NEW RATES IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BEEN IN PLACE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018, PRETAX INCOME FOR THE ELECTRIC SEGMENT WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $2.0 MILLION, OR $0.04 PER SHARE, FOR THE FULL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, AND BY APPROXIMATELY $941,000, OR APPROXIMATELY $0.02 PER SHARE, FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019.  WHEN APPROVED, THE NEW RATES WILL BE RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY 1, 2018 AND RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS FOR 2019 WILL BE RECORDED ACCORDINGLY, AS WELL AS THE $2.0 MILLION, OR $0.04 PER SHARE, RELATED TO 2018.  CONTRACTED SERVICES SEGMENT.  ASUS'S REVENUES, OPERATING INCOME AND CASH FLOWS ARE EARNED BY PROVIDING WATER AND/OR WASTEWATER SERVICES, INCLUDING OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES AND CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES AT THE WATER AND/OR WASTEWATER SYSTEMS AT VARIOUS MILITARY INSTALLATIONS, PURSUANT TO 50-YEAR FIRM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS.  THE CONTRACT PRICE FOR EACH OF THESE 50-YEAR CONTRACTS IS SUBJECT TO ANNUAL ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENTS.  ADDITIONAL REVENUES GENERATED BY CONTRACT OPERATIONS ARE PRIMARILY DEPENDENT ON NEW CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES UNDER CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OR AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER THIRD-PARTY PRIME CONTRACTORS.  FORT RILEY.  ON JULY 1, 2018, ASUS ASSUMED THE OPERATION, MAINTENANCE AND CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT OF THE WATER DISTRIBUTION AND WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT FACILITIES AT FORT RILEY, A UNITED STATES ARMY INSTALLATION LOCATED IN KANSAS, AFTER COMPLETING A TRANSITION PERIOD AND A DETAILED INVENTORY STUDY.  THE 50-YEAR CONTRACT IS ALSO SUBJECT TO ANNUAL ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENTS.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SUMMARY OF  FIRST  QUARTER RESULTS BY SEGMENT  THE TABLE BELOW SETS FORTH THE  FIRST  QUARTER DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT.

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM THE WATER SEGMENT INCREASED  $0.01  TO  $0.21  PER SHARE AS COMPARED TO  $0.20  PER SHARE FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DESPITE THE DELAY IN RECEIVING A FINAL DECISION ON THE WATER GENERAL RATE CASE.  BECAUSE OF THE DELAY, BILLED WATER REVENUES FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 WERE BASED ON 2018 ADOPTED RATES, PENDING A FINAL DECISION BY THE CPUC.  AS A RESULT, THE WATER GROSS MARGIN REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT AFTER EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN THE PENSION BALANCING ACCOUNT AND OF BILLED SURCHARGES, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE NO MATERIAL IMPACT TO EARNINGS.  HAD NEW RATES BEEN IN PLACE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019 BASED ON THE PROPOSED DECISION ISSUED IN APRIL 2019, PRETAX INCOME AT THE WATER SEGMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER BY APPROXIMATELY $4.0 MILLION, OR $0.08 PER SHARE, FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  WHEN APPROVED, THE NEW RATES WILL BE RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY 1, 2019 AND RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE RECORDED ACCORDINGLY.  EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF BILLED SURCHARGES TO RECOVER PREVIOUSLY INCURRED COSTS, WHICH HAVE NO MATERIAL IMPACT TO EARNINGS,   DILUTED EARNINGS FROM GSWC\u2019S WATER OPERATIONS INCREASED COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 DUE MOSTLY TO THE FOLLOWING TWO ITEMS, WHICH, WHEN COMBINED, INCREASED THE WATER SEGMENT\u2019S EARNINGS BY APPROXIMATELY $0.01 PER SHARE.  \u2022  AN INCREASE IN INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE) DUE PRIMARILY TO GAINS RECORDED ON INVESTMENTS HELD TO FUND A RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN AS A RESULT OF MARKET CONDITIONS, AS COMPARED TO LOSSES RECOGNIZED DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE RESULTING FROM HIGHER BORROWINGS TO FUND A PORTION OF GSWC\u2019S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  \u2022  AN OVERALL INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES (EXCLUDING SUPPLY COSTS) DUE PRIMARILY FROM HIGHER WATER TREATMENT, CONSERVATION AND EMPLOYEE-RELATED COMPENSATION COSTS, AS WELL AS DEPRECIATION EXPENSE RESULTING FROM CAPITAL ADDITIONS.  THESE INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MAINTENANCE EXPENSE INCURRED AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  ELECTRIC SEGMENT.  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , DILUTED EARNINGS FROM THE ELECTRIC SEGMENT WERE  $0.03  PER SHARE AS COMPARED TO  $0.04  PER SHARE FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THE DECREASE IN EARNINGS WAS LARGELY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER BASE RATES DUE TO DELAYS IN FINALIZING THE PENDING ELECTRIC GENERAL RATE CASE.  BECAUSE OF THE DELAY, BILLED ELECTRIC REVENUES DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019, AND ALL OF 2018, WERE BASED ON 2017 ADOPTED RATES, PENDING A FINAL DECISION BY THE CPUC IN THE RATE CASE APPLICATION, WHICH WILL BE RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY 1, 2018.  HAD THE NEW RATES IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BEEN APPROVED BY THE CPUC AND IN PLACE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019, PRETAX INCOME AT THE ELECTRIC SEGMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER BY APPROXIMATELY $941,000, OR $0.02 PER SHARE, FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019.  THIS AMOUNT WILL BE RECORDED WHEN A CPUC DECISION IS ISSUED, ALONG WITH $0.04 PER SHARE RELATED TO 2018.  THE INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES WAS DUE MOSTLY TO HIGHER LEGAL AND OUTSIDE SERVICE COSTS, AS WELL AS LABOR AND OTHER EMPLOYEE-RELATED COMPENSATION.  MAINTENANCE AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSES WERE ALSO HIGHER THAN LAST YEAR.  THE HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES (EXCLUDING SUPPLY COSTS), WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER ELECTRIC GROSS MARGIN RESULTING FROM RATE INCREASES GENERATED FROM ADVICE LETTER FILINGS APPROVED BY THE CPUC IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018.  CONTRACTED SERVICES SEGMENT.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  DILUTED EARNINGS FROM THE CONTRACTED SERVICES SEGMENT WERE  $0.11  PER SHARE AS COMPARED TO  $0.05  PER SHARE FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE, IN PART, TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF OPERATIONS AT FORT RILEY IN JULY 2018.  THERE WAS ALSO AN INCREASE IN MANAGEMENT FEES AND CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY AT SEVERAL OTHER MILITARY BASES DUE TO THE SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTION OF VARIOUS PRICE ADJUSTMENTS AND AN OVERALL INCREASE IN CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY.

REGISTRANT RELIES ON ECONOMIC PRICE AND EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENTS BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO RECOVER OPERATING EXPENSES AND PROVIDE A PROFIT MARGIN FOR ASUS.  CURRENT OPERATING REVENUES AND EARNINGS CAN BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IF THE MILITARY PRIVATIZATION SUBSIDIARIES DO NOT RECEIVE ADEQUATE RATE RELIEF OR ADJUSTMENTS IN A TIMELY MANNER.  ASUS\u2019S EARNINGS ARE ALSO IMPACTED BY THE LEVEL OF ADDITIONAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AT THE MILITARY UTILITY PRIVATIZATION SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT CONTINUE AT CURRENT LEVELS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  WATER  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , REVENUES FROM WATER OPERATIONS INCREASED  $311,000  TO  $64.7 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO CPUC-APPROVED RATE INCREASES TO COVER INCREASES IN SUPPLY COSTS EXPERIENCED IN MOST RATEMAKING AREAS, WHICH WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN SUPPLY COSTS, RESULTING IN AN IMMATERIAL IMPACT TO EARNINGS.  THIS INCREASE IN REVENUES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EXPIRATION OF VARIOUS SURCHARGES THAT WERE IN PLACE TO RECOVER PREVIOUSLY INCURRED COSTS.  THE DECREASE IN SURCHARGE REVENUES WAS OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES (PRIMARILY ADMINISTRATIVE AND GENERAL), ALSO RESULTING IN NO IMPACT TO EARNINGS.  EXCLUDING THE ITEMS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WATER REVENUES REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT DUE TO THE DELAY IN RECEIVING A FINAL DECISION ON THE WATER GENERAL RATE CASE.  IN JULY 2017, GSWC FILED A GENERAL RATE CASE APPLICATION FOR ITS WATER REGIONS AND THE GENERAL OFFICE FOR NEW RATES IN YEARS 2019 THROUGH 2021.  PENDING A FINAL CPUC DECISION ON THIS GENERAL RATE CASE, YEAR-TO-DATE 2019 BILLED REVENUES HAVE BEEN BASED ON 2018 ADOPTED RATES.  ON APRIL 8, 2019, THE CPUC ISSUED A PROPOSED DECISION ON THIS GENERAL RATE CASE.  ONCE A FINAL DECISION IS RECEIVED, NEW RATES WILL BE RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY 1, 2019.  BILLED WATER CONSUMPTION FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 16% AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE TO WET WEATHER CONDITIONS EXPERIENCED IN LATE 2018 AND EARLY 2019.  IN GENERAL, CHANGES IN CONSUMPTION DO NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON RECORDED REVENUES DUE TO THE CPUC-APPROVED WATER REVENUE ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM (\"WRAM\") IN PLACE AT ALL BUT ONE SMALL RATE-MAKING AREA.  HOWEVER, UNDER THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR ALTERNATIVE REVENUE PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE WRAM, SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN CONSUMPTION MAY IMPACT THE TIMING OF WHEN REVENUES ARE RECORDED.  GSWC RECORDS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT IT BILLS ITS WATER CUSTOMERS AND THAT WHICH IS AUTHORIZED BY THE CPUC IN THE WRAM ACCOUNTS AS REGULATORY ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  ELECTRIC  GSWC FILED ITS ELECTRIC GENERAL RATE CASE IN MAY 2017 FOR RATES IN YEARS 2018 THROUGH 2021.  PENDING A FINAL CPUC DECISION ON THE GENERAL RATE CASE, YEAR-TO-DATE BILLED REVENUES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND FOR ALL OF 2018, HAVE BEEN BASED ON 2017 ADOPTED RATES.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , ELECTRIC REVENUES INCREASED BY  $797,000  , LARGELY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ELECTRIC USAGE AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THE INCREASE IN USAGE CREATES A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN SUPPLY COSTS FROM THE HIGHER ELECTRIC USAGE, RESULTING IN NO MATERIAL IMPACT TO EARNINGS.  THERE WERE ALSO INCREASES IN ELECTRIC RATES DUE TO ADVICE LETTER PROJECTS APPROVED BY THE CPUC DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018.  BILLED ELECTRIC USAGE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 11% AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  DUE TO THE CPUC-APPROVED BASE REVENUE REQUIREMENT ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM (\"BRRAM\"), WHICH ADJUSTS CERTAIN REVENUES TO ADOPTED LEVELS AUTHORIZED BY THE CPUC, CHANGES IN USAGE DO NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON EARNINGS.  CONTRACTED SERVICES  REVENUES FROM CONTRACTED SERVICES ARE COMPOSED OF CONSTRUCTION REVENUES (INCLUDING RENEWAL AND REPLACEMENTS) AND MANAGEMENT FEES FOR OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THE WATER AND/OR WASTEWATER SYSTEMS AT VARIOUS MILITARY BASES.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , REVENUES FROM CONTRACTED SERVICES INCREASED  $5.9 MILLION  TO  $26.4 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $20.5 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  LARGELY DUE TO THE COMMENCEMENT OF OPERATIONS AT FORT RILEY IN JULY 2018.  ASUS SUBSIDIARIES CONTINUE TO ENTER INTO U.S. GOVERNMENT-AWARDED CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS AND AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY PRIME CONTRACTORS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AT THE MILITARY UTILITY PRIVATIZATION SUBSIDIARIES.

REVENUES INCLUDE SURCHARGES, WHICH INCREASE BOTH REVENUES AND OPERATING EXPENSES BY CORRESPONDING AMOUNTS, THUS HAVING NO NET EARNINGS IMPACT.  (2)   WATER AND ELECTRIC GROSS MARGINS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, MAINTENANCE, ADMINISTRATIVE AND GENERAL, PROPERTY OR OTHER TAXES OR OTHER OPERATION EXPENSES.  TWO OF THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS AFFECTING WATER SUPPLY COSTS ARE THE AMOUNT OF WATER PRODUCED AND THE SOURCE OF THE WATER. GENERALLY, THE VARIABLE COST OF PRODUCING WATER FROM WELLS IS LESS THAN THE COST OF WATER PURCHASED FROM WHOLESALE SUPPLIERS. UNDER THE CPUC-APPROVED MODIFIED COST BALANCING ACCOUNT (\"MCBA\"), GSWC TRACKS ADOPTED AND ACTUAL EXPENSE LEVELS FOR PURCHASED WATER, POWER PURCHASED FOR PUMPING AND PUMP TAXES.  GSWC RECORDS THE VARIANCES (WHICH INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CHANGES IN BOTH RATE AND VOLUME) BETWEEN ADOPTED AND ACTUAL PURCHASED WATER, PURCHASED POWER, AND PUMP TAX EXPENSES.  GSWC RECOVERS FROM, OR REFUNDS TO, CUSTOMERS THE AMOUNT OF SUCH VARIANCES.  GSWC TRACKS THESE VARIANCES INDIVIDUALLY FOR EACH WATER RATEMAKING AREA.  THE OVERALL ACTUAL PERCENTAGE OF PURCHASED WATER FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  2019  WAS APPROXIMATELY 43% AS COMPARED TO THE LAST AUTHORIZED ADOPTED PERCENTAGE OF 25%, WHICH WAS FOR 2018 AND IS PENDING A FINAL DECISION ON THE WATER GENERAL RATE CASE.  THE HIGHER ACTUAL PERCENTAGE OF PURCHASED WATER AS COMPARED TO THE ADOPTED PERCENTAGE RESULTED FROM A HIGHER VOLUME OF PURCHASED WATER COSTS DUE TO SEVERAL WELLS BEING OUT OF SERVICE.  PURCHASED WATER COSTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  2019  DECREASED TO  $13.1 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $13.6 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE TO A DECREASE IN CUSTOMER USAGE.  THE DECREASES IN POWER PURCHASED FOR PUMPING AND GROUNDWATER PRODUCTION ASSESSMENTS WERE ALSO LARGELY DUE TO A DECREASE IN CUSTOMER USAGE AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  THE UNDER-COLLECTION IN THE WATER SUPPLY COST BALANCING ACCOUNT DECREASED  $2.2 MILLION  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  2019  MAINLY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN CUSTOMER USAGE, AS WELL AS CPUC-APPROVED RATE INCREASES IMPLEMENTED IN JULY 2018 TO COVER SUPPLY-COST INCREASES EXPERIENCED IN PRIOR YEARS.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  2019  , THE COST OF POWER PURCHASED FOR RESALE TO BVES'S CUSTOMERS WAS  $3.7 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $3.4 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER USAGE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER AVERAGE PRICE PER MEGAWATT HOUR (\"MWH\").  THE AVERAGE PRICE PER MWH, INCLUDING FIXED COSTS, DECREASED FROM $79.44 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  2018  TO $77.77 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  .  THE OVER-COLLECTION IN THE ELECTRIC SUPPLY COST BALANCING ACCOUNT INCREASED AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  2018  DUE TO THE DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE PRICE PER MWH.

AWR'S CONSOLIDATED ETR INCREASED BECAUSE OF HIGHER STATE UNITARY TAXES AT AWR (PARENT).  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF AWR\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS, AND REQUIRE THE MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS OF AWR\u2019S MANAGEMENT.  THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF ITEMS THAT ARE UNCERTAIN IS WHAT MAKES THESE JUDGMENTS DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND/OR COMPLEX.  MANAGEMENT MAKES SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE ACCOUNTING AND REGULATORY TREATMENT OF MANY ITEMS.  THESE JUDGMENTS ARE BASED ON AWR\u2019S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TERMS OF EXISTING CONTRACTS, AWR\u2019S OBSERVANCE OF TRENDS IN THE INDUSTRY, AND INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM OTHER OUTSIDE SOURCES, AS APPROPRIATE.  ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE REGISTRANT\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT IT BELIEVES AFFECT THE MORE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT ARE DESCRIBED IN  \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d  INCLUDED IN REGISTRANT\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018  .  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO REGISTRANT\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  REGISTRANT ADOPTED THE NEW LEASE GUIDANCE BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2019 AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 10 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AWR  REGISTRANT\u2019S REGULATED BUSINESS IS CAPITAL INTENSIVE AND REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE CAPITAL RESOURCES.  A PORTION OF THESE CAPITAL RESOURCES IS PROVIDED BY INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS.  AWR ANTICIPATES THAT INTEREST EXPENSE WILL INCREASE DUE TO THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL EXTERNAL CAPITAL TO FUND ITS CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM AND INCREASES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES.  AWR BELIEVES THAT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CAPITAL USED TO FUND CONSTRUCTION AT GSWC WILL CONTINUE TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH WATER AND ELECTRIC RATES CHARGED TO CUSTOMERS.  AWR FUNDS ITS OPERATING EXPENSES AND PAYS DIVIDENDS ON ITS OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES PRIMARILY THROUGH DIVIDENDS FROM ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES.  THE ABILITY OF GSWC TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO AWR IS RESTRICTED BY CALIFORNIA LAW.  UNDER THESE RESTRICTIONS, APPROXIMATELY  $210.0 MILLION  WAS AVAILABLE ON  MARCH 31, 2019  TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO AWR.  THE ABILITY OF ASUS TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO AWR IS ALSO RESTRICTED BY CALIFORNIA LAW AND BY THE ABILITY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO IT.  WHEN NECESSARY, REGISTRANT OBTAINS FUNDS FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS AND THROUGH BANK BORROWINGS. ACCESS TO EXTERNAL FINANCING ON REASONABLE TERMS DEPENDS ON THE CREDIT RATINGS OF AWR AND GSWC AND CURRENT BUSINESS CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THAT OF THE WATER UTILITY INDUSTRY IN GENERAL AS WELL AS CONDITIONS IN THE DEBT OR EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS.  AWR BORROWS UNDER A CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH EXPIRES IN MAY 2023, AND PROVIDES FUNDS TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES, GSWC AND ASUS, IN SUPPORT OF THEIR OPERATIONS.  IN MARCH 2019, AWR AMENDED THIS CREDIT FACILITY TO INCREASE ITS BORROWING CAPACITY FROM $150.0 MILLION TO  $200.0 MILLION  .  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THERE WERE  $151.5 MILLION  IN BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS FACILITY AND  $940,000  OF LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , AWR HAD  $47.6 MILLION  AVAILABLE TO BORROW UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY.  IN APRIL 2019, STANDARD AND POOR\u2019S GLOBAL RATINGS (\u201cS&P\u201d) AFFIRMED AN A+ CREDIT RATING WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK ON BOTH AWR AND GSWC.  S&P\u2019S DEBT RATINGS RANGE FROM AAA (HIGHEST POSSIBLE) TO D (OBLIGATION IS IN DEFAULT).  IN JANUARY 2019, MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE (\"MOODY'S\") AFFIRMED ITS A2 RATING WITH A POSITIVE OUTLOOK FOR GSWC.  SECURITIES RATINGS ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS TO BUY, SELL OR HOLD A SECURITY, AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE OR WITHDRAWAL AT ANY TIME BY THE RATING AGENCIES.  REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT AWR\u2019S SOUND CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND A+ CREDIT RATING, COMBINED WITH ITS FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE, WILL ENABLE AWR TO ACCESS THE DEBT AND EQUITY MARKETS.  HOWEVER, UNPREDICTABLE FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE FUTURE MAY LIMIT ITS ACCESS OR IMPACT THE TIMING OF WHEN TO ACCESS THE MARKET, IN WHICH CASE REGISTRANT MAY CHOOSE TO TEMPORARILY REDUCE ITS CAPITAL SPENDING.  IF NEEDED, GSWC MAY ISSUE LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE FUTURE, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE PROCEEDS FROM ANY SUCH DEBT ISSUANCE WOULD BE USED TO PAY DOWN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND FUND A PORTION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , GSWC INCURRED $38.2 MILLION IN COMPANY-FUNDED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  DURING  2019  , REGISTRANT'S COMPANY-FUNDED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $115 - $125 MILLION.  AWR\u2019S ABILITY TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON CASH FLOWS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES.  AWR INTENDS TO CONTINUE PAYING QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS ON OR ABOUT MARCH 1, JUNE 1, SEPTEMBER 1 AND DECEMBER 1, SUBJECT TO EARNINGS AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS, REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND SUCH OTHER FACTORS AS THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY DEEM RELEVANT.  REGISTRANT HAS PAID COMMON DIVIDENDS FOR OVER 80 CONSECUTIVE YEARS.  ON MAY 1, 2019, AWR'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SECOND QUARTER DIVIDEND OF $0.275 PER SHARE ON AWR'S COMMON SHARES.  DIVIDENDS ON THE COMMON SHARES WILL BE PAID ON JUNE 3, 2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON MAY 16, 2019.  REGISTRANT'S CURRENT LIABILITIES MAY AT TIMES EXCEED ITS CURRENT ASSETS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS ALONG WITH BORROWINGS FROM AWR'S CREDIT FACILITY ARE ADEQUATE TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO MAINTAIN NORMAL OPERATIONS AND TO MEET ITS CAPITAL AND FINANCING REQUIREMENTS.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  .  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES HAVE GENERALLY PROVIDED SUFFICIENT CASH TO FUND OPERATING REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING A PORTION OF CONSTRUCTION EXPENDITURES AT GSWC AND CONSTRUCTION EXPENSES AT ASUS, AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS. REGISTRANT\u2019S FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING UTILITY REGULATION; CHANGES IN TAX LAW; MAINTENANCE EXPENSES; INFLATION; COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS; PRODUCTION COSTS; CUSTOMER GROWTH; PER-CUSTOMER USAGE OF WATER AND ELECTRICITY; WEATHER AND SEASONALITY; CONSERVATION EFFORTS; COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING MANDATORY RESTRICTIONS ON WATER USE; AND REQUIRED CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT PLANS.  FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM CONTRACTED SERVICES SUBSIDIARIES WILL DEPEND ON NEW BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, EXISTING OPERATIONS, THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW AND/OR REPLACEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AT MILITARY BASES, TIMELY ECONOMIC PRICE AND EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENT OF PRICES, AND TIMELY COLLECTION OF PAYMENTS FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND OTHER PRIME CONTRACTORS OPERATING AT THE MILITARY BASES.  THE LOWER FEDERAL TAX RATE AND THE ELIMINATION OF BONUS DEPRECIATION BROUGHT ABOUT BY 2017'S TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\"TAX ACT\") ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE REGISTRANT'S CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AND RESULT IN HIGHER FINANCING COSTS ARISING FROM AN INCREASED NEED TO RAISE DEBT AND/OR EQUITY.  ASUS FUNDS ITS OPERATING EXPENSES PRIMARILY THROUGH INTERNAL OPERATING SOURCES, WHICH INCLUDE U.S. GOVERNMENT FUNDING UNDER 50-YEAR CONTRACTS FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS AND CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS BY, OR LOANS FROM, AWR.  ASUS, IN TURN, PROVIDES FUNDING TO ITS SUBSIDIARIES.  ASUS'S SUBSIDIARIES MAY ALSO FROM TIME TO TIME PROVIDE FUNDING TO ASUS OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ARE PRIMARILY GENERATED BY NET INCOME, ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH EXPENSES SUCH AS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES.  CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS VARIES DURING THE YEAR.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF REGISTRANT WAS  $29.4 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $35.7 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THERE WAS A DECREASE IN CASH RECEIPTS DUE TO LOWER WATER CUSTOMER USAGE AND THE EXPIRATION OF VARIOUS SURCHARGES RELATED TO GSWC\u2019S REGULATORY ACCOUNTS.  THE DELAY IN THE WATER GENERAL RATE CASE HAS ALSO AFFECTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2019 AS YEAR-TO-DATE BILLED REVENUES HAVE BEEN BASED ON 2018'S ADOPTED CUSTOMER RATES. THE TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS AND DISBURSEMENTS RELATED TO OTHER WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS ALSO AFFECTED THE CHANGE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  .  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $40.3 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $30.2 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF 2019.  REGISTRANT INVESTS CAPITAL TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO ITS REGULATED CUSTOMER BASE, WHILE WORKING WITH ITS REGULATORS TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN A FAIR RATE OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT.  REGISTRANT\u2019S INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT PLAN CONSISTS OF BOTH INFRASTRUCTURE RENEWAL PROGRAMS (WHERE INFRASTRUCTURE IS REPLACED, AS NEEDED) AND MAJOR CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROJECTS (WHERE NEW WATER TREATMENT, SUPPLY AND DELIVERY FACILITIES ARE CONSTRUCTED).  GSWC MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED FROM TIME TO TIME TO RELOCATE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS.  PROJECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC REVIEW AND REVISION.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  .  REGISTRANT\u2019S FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE PRIMARILY: (I) THE SALE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON SHARES AND STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND THE REPURCHASE OF COMMON SHARES, (II) THE ISSUANCE AND REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND NOTES PAYABLE TO BANKS, AND (III) THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS ON COMMON SHARES.  IN ORDER TO FINANCE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE, REGISTRANT ALSO RECEIVES CUSTOMER ADVANCES (NET OF REFUNDS) FOR, AND CONTRIBUTIONS IN AID OF, CONSTRUCTION.  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS ARE USED TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES UNTIL LONG-TERM FINANCING IS ARRANGED.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $5.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $276,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THIS INCREASE IN CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BORROWINGS FROM REGISTRANT'S REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  .  THE INCREASED BORROWINGS WERE USED TO REPAY $40.0 MILLION OF GSWC'S  6.70%  SENIOR NOTE, WHICH MATURED IN MARCH 2019, AND TO FUND A PORTION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  GSWC  GSWC FUNDS ITS OPERATING EXPENSES, PAYMENTS ON ITS DEBT, DIVIDENDS ON ITS OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES, AND A PORTION OF ITS CONSTRUCTION EXPENDITURES THROUGH INTERNAL SOURCES.  INTERNAL SOURCES OF CASH FLOW ARE PROVIDED PRIMARILY BY RETENTION OF A PORTION OF EARNINGS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  INTERNAL CASH GENERATION IS INFLUENCED BY FACTORS SUCH AS WEATHER PATTERNS, CONSERVATION EFFORTS, ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION, LITIGATION, CHANGES IN TAX LAW AND DEFERRED TAXES, CHANGES IN SUPPLY COSTS AND REGULATORY DECISIONS AFFECTING GSWC\u2019S ABILITY TO RECOVER THESE SUPPLY COSTS, TIMING OF RATE RELIEF, INCREASES IN MAINTENANCE EXPENSES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, SURCHARGES AUTHORIZED BY THE CPUC TO ENABLE GSWC TO RECOVER EXPENSES PREVIOUSLY INCURRED FROM CUSTOMERS, AND CPUC REQUIREMENTS TO REFUND AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY CHARGED TO CUSTOMERS.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GSWC MAY, AT TIMES, UTILIZE EXTERNAL SOURCES, INCLUDING EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS FROM AWR, AND LONG-TERM DEBT TO HELP FUND A PORTION OF ITS CONSTRUCTION EXPENDITURES.  IN ADDITION, GSWC RECEIVES ADVANCES AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM CUSTOMERS, HOMEBUILDERS AND REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS TO FUND CONSTRUCTION NECESSARY TO EXTEND SERVICE TO NEW AREAS.  ADVANCES FOR CONSTRUCTION ARE GENERALLY REFUNDABLE AT A RATE OF 2.5% IN EQUAL ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS OVER 40 YEARS.  AMOUNTS THAT ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO REFUND ARE RECLASSIFIED TO CONTRIBUTIONS IN AID OF CONSTRUCTION.  UTILITY PLANT FUNDED BY ADVANCES AND CONTRIBUTIONS IS EXCLUDED FROM RATE BASE.  GENERALLY, GSWC AMORTIZES CONTRIBUTIONS IN AID OF CONSTRUCTION AT THE SAME COMPOSITE RATE OF DEPRECIATION FOR THE RELATED PROPERTY.  IN DECEMBER 2017, THE TAX ACT WAS SIGNED INTO FEDERAL LAW.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS MAJOR TAX REFORM WERE GENERALLY EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROVISIONS OF THE TAX ACT IMPACTING GSWC WAS THE REDUCTION OF THE FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% AND THE ELIMINATION OF BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR REGULATED UTILITIES.  PURSUANT TO A CPUC DIRECTIVE, THE 2018 IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT ON THE WATER ADOPTED REVENUE REQUIREMENT WAS TRACKED IN A MEMORANDUM ACCOUNT EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018.  ON JULY 1, 2018, NEW LOWER WATER RATES, WHICH INCORPORATE THE NEW FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE, WERE IMPLEMENTED FOR ALL WATER RATEMAKING AREAS.  THE 2018 OVER-COLLECTION RECORDED IN THIS MEMORANDUM ACCOUNT RELATED TO THE WATER SEGMENT WAS $7.1 MILLION AND WILL BE REFUNDED TO CUSTOMERS ONCE A FINAL DECISION IS RECEIVED FROM THE CPUC ON THE PENDING WATER GENERAL RATE CASE.  A FINAL DECISION IS EXPECTED LATER IN 2019.  AS IS OFTEN THE CASE WITH PUBLIC UTILITIES, GSWC\u2019S CURRENT LIABILITIES MAY AT TIMES EXCEED ITS CURRENT ASSETS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS ALONG WITH THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT, BORROWINGS FROM AWR AND COMMON SHARE ISSUANCES TO AWR WILL BE ADEQUATE TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ENABLE GSWC TO MAINTAIN NORMAL OPERATIONS AND TO MEET ITS CAPITAL AND FINANCING REQUIREMENTS PENDING RECOVERY OF COSTS IN RATES.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  .  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $25.9 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $33.4 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THERE WAS A DECREASE IN CASH RECEIPTS DUE TO LOWER WATER CUSTOMER USAGE AND THE EXPIRATION OF VARIOUS SURCHARGES RELATED TO GSWC\u2019S REGULATORY ACCOUNTS.  THE DELAY IN THE WATER GENERAL RATE CASE HAS ALSO AFFECTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN 2019 AS YEAR-TO-DATE BILLED REVENUES HAVE BEEN BASED ON 2018'S ADOPTED CUSTOMER RATES.  THE TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS AND DISBURSEMENTS RELATED TO OTHER WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS ALSO AFFECTED THE CHANGE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  .  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $38.9 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $27.5 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  CASH USED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WAS  $39.1 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $27.6 MILLION  DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  DURING 2019, GSWC'S COMPANY-FUNDED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $115 - $125 MILLION.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  .  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $9.4 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO CASH USED OF  $3.9 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THE INCREASE IN CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  USED TO REPAY $40.0 MILLION OF GSWC'S  6.70%  SENIOR NOTE, WHICH MATURED IN MARCH 2019, AND TO FUND A PORTION OF GSWC'S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS  REGISTRANT HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. OTHER ITEMS, SUCH AS CERTAIN PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUT ARE REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED.  IN ADDITION TO CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES, REGISTRANT HAS CERTAIN DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT CONTAIN AN ANNUAL SINKING FUND OR OTHER PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS.  REGISTRANT BELIEVES THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO REFINANCE DEBT INSTRUMENTS AT THEIR MATURITY THROUGH PUBLIC ISSUANCE, OR PRIVATE PLACEMENT, OF DEBT OR EQUITY.  ANNUAL PAYMENTS TO SERVICE DEBT ARE GENERALLY MADE FROM CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS.  SEE  \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u2014CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\u201d  SECTION OF THE REGISTRANT\u2019S FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018  FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS.  IN MARCH 2019, GSWC REPAID $40 MILLION OF ITS 6.70% SENIOR NOTE.  EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019, REGISTRANT ADOPTED THE NEW LEASE STANDARD AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 10 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONTRACTED SERVICES  UNDER THE TERMS OF ITS UTILITY PRIVATIZATION CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, EACH CONTRACT'S PRICE IS SUBJECT TO AN ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT (\u201cEPA\u201d) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.  IN THE EVENT THAT ASUS (I) IS MANAGING MORE ASSETS AT SPECIFIC MILITARY BASES THAN WERE INCLUDED IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\u2019S REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, (II) IS MANAGING ASSETS THAT ARE IN SUBSTANDARD CONDITION AS COMPARED TO WHAT WAS DISCLOSED IN THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, (III) PRUDENTLY INCURS COSTS NOT CONTEMPLATED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE UTILITY PRIVATIZATION CONTRACT, AND/OR (IV) BECOMES SUBJECT TO NEW REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS MORE STRINGENT WATER-QUALITY STANDARDS, ASUS IS PERMITTED TO FILE, AND HAS FILED, REQUESTS FOR EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENT (\u201cREA\u201d).  THE TIMELY FILING FOR AND RECEIPT OF EPAS AND/OR REAS CONTINUES TO BE CRITICAL IN ORDER FOR THE MILITARY UTILITY PRIVATIZATION SUBSIDIARIES TO RECOVER INCREASING COSTS OF OPERATING AND MAINTAINING, AND RENEWING AND REPLACING THE WATER AND/OR WASTEWATER SYSTEMS AT THE MILITARY BASES IT SERVES.  UNDER THE BUDGET CONTROL ACT OF 2011 (THE \u201c2011 ACT\u201d), SUBSTANTIAL AUTOMATIC SPENDING CUTS, KNOWN AS \"SEQUESTRATION,\" HAVE IMPACTED THE EXPECTED LEVELS OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BUDGETING.  THE MILITARY UTILITY PRIVATIZATION SUBSIDIARIES HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY EARNINGS IMPACT TO THEIR EXISTING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AND RENEWAL AND REPLACEMENT SERVICES, AS UTILITY PRIVATIZATION CONTRACTS ARE AN \"EXCEPTED SERVICE\" WITHIN THE 2011 ACT.  WHILE THE ONGOING EFFECTS OF SEQUESTRATION HAVE BEEN MITIGATED THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF A CONTINUING RESOLUTION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2019 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BUDGET, SIMILAR ISSUES MAY ARISE AS PART OF FISCAL UNCERTAINTY AND/OR FUTURE DEBT-CEILING LIMITS IMPOSED BY CONGRESS.  HOWEVER, ANY FUTURE IMPACT ON ASUS AND ITS OPERATIONS THROUGH THE MILITARY UTILITY PRIVATIZATION SUBSIDIARIES WILL LIKELY BE LIMITED TO (A) THE TIMING OF FUNDING TO PAY FOR SERVICES RENDERED, (B) DELAYS IN THE PROCESSING OF EPAS AND/OR REAS, (C) THE TIMING OF THE ISSUANCE OF CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION WORK NOT ALREADY FUNDED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AND/OR (D) DELAYS IN THE SOLICITATION FOR AND/OR AWARDING OF NEW CONTRACTS UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE UTILITY PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM.  AT TIMES, THE DEFENSE CONTRACT AUDIT AGENCY AND/OR THE DEFENSE CONTRACT MANAGEMENT AGENCY MAY, AT THE REQUEST OF A CONTRACTING OFFICER, PERFORM AUDITS/REVIEWS OF CONTRACTORS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN GOVERNMENT GUIDANCE AND REGULATIONS, SUCH AS THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS AND DEFENSE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION SUPPLEMENTS.  CERTAIN AUDIT/REVIEW FINDINGS, SUCH AS SYSTEM DEFICIENCIES FOR GOVERNMENT-CONTRACT-BUSINESS-SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS, MAY RESULT IN DELAYS IN THE TIMING OF RESOLUTION OF FILINGS SUBMITTED TO AND/OR THE ABILITY TO FILE NEW PROPOSALS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.  REGULATORY MATTERS  PENDING GENERAL RATE CASE FILINGS.  WATER SEGMENT.  IN JULY 2017, GSWC FILED A GENERAL RATE CASE APPLICATION FOR ITS WATER REGIONS AND THE GENERAL OFFICE.  THE GENERAL RATE CASE WILL DETERMINE NEW WATER RATES FOR THE YEARS 2019 THROUGH 2021.  ON AUGUST 15, 2018, GSWC AND THE CPUC\u2019S PUBLIC ADVOCATES OFFICE FILED A JOINT MOTION TO ADOPT A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE GENERAL RATE CASE.  ON APRIL 8, 2019, THE ASSIGNED ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ISSUED A PROPOSED DECISION (\"PD\") ON THE GENERAL RATE CASE.  THE PD APPROVES THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ADVICE LETTER CAPITAL PROJECTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $20.4 MILLION THAT WERE AGREED TO BY GSWC AND THE CPUC\u2019S PUBLIC ADVOCATES OFFICE IN THE SETTLEMENT.  THE PD DOES NOT EXPLICITLY DISALLOW THESE PROJECTS, BUT INSTEAD INSTRUCTS GSWC TO INCLUDE THESE PROJECTS IN ITS NEXT GENERAL RATE CASE FILING.  AS A RESULT, NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE RECORDED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  RELATED TO THE IMMATERIAL COSTS INCURRED TO DATE FOR THESE PROJECTS.  GSWC AND THE CPUC'S PUBLIC ADVOCATES OFFICE HAVE SEPARATELY FILED THEIR RESPONSE AND COMMENTS TO THE PD, AND BOTH PARTIES DISPUTE THE ALJ'S REJECTION OF THE ADVICE LETTER CAPITAL PROJECTS.  AT THIS TIME, GSWC CANNOT PREDICT THE FINAL OUTCOME REGARDING THIS MATTER; HOWEVER, IF THE PD IS APPROVED AS IS, IT WOULD AUTHORIZE GSWC TO INVEST APPROXIMATELY $314.1 MILLION IN CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE OVER THE THREE-YEAR RATE CYCLE, AND WOULD INCREASE THE WATER GROSS MARGIN FOR 2019 BY APPROXIMATELY $7.1 MILLION, ADJUSTED FOR UPDATED INFLATION INDEX VALUES SINCE THE AUGUST SETTLEMENT, AS COMPARED TO THE 2018 ADOPTED WATER GROSS MARGIN.  THE 2019 WATER REVENUE REQUIREMENT IN THE PD HAS BEEN REDUCED TO REFLECT A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $7.0 MILLION IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE, COMPARED TO THE ADOPTED 2018 DEPRECIATION EXPENSE, DUE TO A REDUCTION IN THE OVERALL COMPOSITE DEPRECIATION RATES BASED ON A REVISED STUDY FILED IN THE GENERAL RATE CASE.  THE DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE LOWERS THE WATER GROSS MARGIN, AND IS OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE, RESULTING IN NO IMPACT TO NET EARNINGS. IN ADDITION, THE 2019 WATER REVENUE REQUIREMENT IN THE PD INCLUDES A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $2.2 MILLION FOR EXCESS DEFERRED TAX REFUNDS AS A RESULT OF THE TAX ACT, WHICH HAS A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND ALSO RESULTS IN NO IMPACT TO NET EARNINGS.  HAD DEPRECIATION EXPENSE IN THE PD REMAINED THE SAME AS THE 2018 ADOPTED AMOUNT AND THERE WAS NO EXCESS DEFERRED TAX REFUND THAT LOWERED THE 2019 REVENUE REQUIREMENT, THE WATER GROSS MARGIN FOR 2019 WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $16.3 MILLION.  DUE TO THE DELAY IN RECEIVING A FINAL DECISION BY THE CPUC ON THE WATER GENERAL RATE CASE, BILLED WATER REVENUES FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 WERE BASED ON 2018 ADOPTED RATES.  BASED ON THE PD, HAD NEW RATES BEEN IN PLACE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019, PRETAX INCOME FOR THE WATER SEGMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER BY APPROXIMATELY $4.0 MILLION, OR $0.08 PER SHARE, FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  WHEN APPROVED, THE NEW RATES WILL BE RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY 1, 2019 AND RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS WILL  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BE RECORDED ACCORDINGLY.  THE PD ALSO ALLOWS FOR POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL WATER REVENUE INCREASES IN 2020 AND 2021 OF APPROXIMATELY $9.6 MILLION AND $12.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, SUBJECT TO THE RESULTS OF AN EARNINGS TEST AND CHANGES TO FORECASTED INFLATIONARY INDEX VALUES.  ELECTRIC SEGMENT  .  IN MAY 2017, GSWC FILED ITS ELECTRIC GENERAL RATE CASE APPLICATION WITH THE CPUC TO DETERMINE NEW ELECTRIC RATES FOR THE YEARS 2018 THROUGH 2021.  IN NOVEMBER 2018, GSWC AND THE PUBLIC ADVOCATES OFFICE FILED A JOINT MOTION TO ADOPT A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES RESOLVING ALL ISSUES IN CONNECTION WITH THE GENERAL RATE CASE.  AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SETTLEMENT INCORPORATES A PREVIOUS STIPULATION IN THE CASE, WHICH AUTHORIZES A NEW RETURN ON EQUITY FOR GSWC'S ELECTRIC SEGMENT OF 9.60%, AS COMPARED TO ITS PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED RETURN OF 9.95%.  THE STIPULATION ALSO INCLUDED A CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND DEBT COST SIMILAR TO THOSE APPROVED BY THE CPUC IN MARCH 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH GSWC'S WATER SEGMENT COST OF CAPITAL PROCEEDING.   FURTHERMORE, THE SETTLEMENT (I) EXTENDS THE RATE CYCLE BY ONE YEAR (NEW RATES WILL BE FOR 2018-2022); (II) INCREASES THE ELECTRIC GROSS MARGIN FOR 2018 BY APPROXIMATELY $2.0 MILLION COMPARED TO THE 2017 ADOPTED ELECTRIC GROSS MARGIN, ADJUSTED FOR THE TAX ACT; (III) AUTHORIZES BVES TO INVEST APPROXIMATELY $44 MILLION IN CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR 2018-2022, WHICH INCLUDES ALL REQUESTED CAPITAL PROJECTS PLUS AN ADDITIONAL $3 MILLION FOR 2022; AND (IV) INCREASES THE ADOPTED ELECTRIC GROSS MARGIN BY $1.2 MILLION FOR EACH OF THE YEARS 2019 AND 2020, BY $1.1 MILLION IN 2021, AND BY $1.0 MILLION IN 2022.  THE RATE INCREASES FOR 2019 \u2013 2022 ARE NOT SUBJECT TO AN EARNINGS TEST.  BECAUSE OF THE DELAY IN FINALIZING THE ELECTRIC GENERAL RATE CASE, BILLED ELECTRIC REVENUES DURING 2018 AND THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 WERE BASED ON 2017 ADOPTED RATES, PENDING A FINAL DECISION BY THE CPUC IN THIS RATE CASE APPLICATION.  HAD THE NEW RATES IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BEEN IN PLACE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018, PRETAX INCOME AT THE ELECTRIC SEGMENT WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $2.0 MILLION, OR $0.04 PER SHARE, FOR THE FULL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, AND BY APPROXIMATELY $941,000, OR APPROXIMATELY $0.02 PER SHARE, FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019.  WHEN APPROVED, THE NEW RATES WILL BE RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY 1, 2018 AND RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS FOR 2019 AND 2018 WILL BE RECORDED ACCORDINGLY.  APPLICATION TO TRANSFER ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS TO NEW SUBSIDIARY  .  ON DECEMBER 14, 2018, GSWC FILED AN APPLICATION WITH THE CPUC TO TRANSFER THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE BVES DIVISION OF GSWC TO BEAR VALLEY ELECTRIC SERVICE, INC. (\u201cBVES INC.\u201d), A NEWLY CREATED SEPARATE LEGAL ENTITY AND STAND-ALONE SUBSIDIARY OF AWR.  DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN OPERATIONS, REGULATIONS, AND RISKS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES A SEPARATE ELECTRIC LEGAL ENTITY AND STAND-ALONE SUBSIDIARY OF AWR IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, AND THE COMMUNITIES SERVED.  THIS APPLICATION IS SUBJECT TO CPUC APPROVAL AND, IF APPROVED, IS NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE TO AWR'S OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE CITY OF BIG BEAR LAKE FILED A PROTEST TO THE APPLICATION.  GSWC HAS FILED REPLY COMMENTS WITH THE CPUC.  THE CPUC HAS NOT ESTABLISHED A TIMELINE FOR ITS REVIEW OF THE APPLICATION.  SEE  \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u2014REGULATORY MATTERS\u201d  SECTION OF THE REGISTRANT\u2019S FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR-ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018  FOR A DISCUSSION OF OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS  GSWC IS REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE SAFE DRINKING WATER STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (\u201cUS EPA\u201d) AND THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER (\"DDW\"), UNDER THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD (\u201cSWRCB\u201d).  THE US EPA REGULATES CONTAMINANTS THAT MAY HAVE ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS THAT ARE KNOWN OR LIKELY TO OCCUR AT LEVELS OF PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN, AND THE REGULATION OF WHICH WILL PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR HEALTH RISK REDUCTION.  THE DDW, ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE US EPA, ADMINISTERS THE US EPA\u2019S PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA.  SIMILAR STATE AGENCIES ADMINISTER THESE RULES IN THE OTHER STATES IN WHICH REGISTRANT OPERATES.  GSWC CURRENTLY TESTS ITS WATER SUPPLIES AND WATER SYSTEMS ACCORDING TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIREMENTS LISTED IN THE FEDERAL SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT (\u201cSDWA\u201d).  IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SDWA AND TO ASSURE A SAFE DRINKING WATER SUPPLY TO ITS CUSTOMERS, GSWC HAS INCURRED OPERATING COSTS FOR TESTING TO DETERMINE THE LEVELS, IF ANY, OF THE CONSTITUENTS IN ITS SOURCES OF SUPPLY AND ADDITIONAL EXPENSE TO TREAT CONTAMINANTS IN ORDER TO MEET FEDERAL AND STATE MAXIMUM CONTAMINANT LEVEL STANDARDS AND CONSUMER DEMANDS.  GSWC EXPECTS TO INCUR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL COSTS AS WELL AS INCREASED OPERATING COSTS TO MAINTAIN OR IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF WATER DELIVERED TO ITS CUSTOMERS IN LIGHT OF ANTICIPATED STRESS ON WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATED WITH WATERSHED AND AQUIFER POLLUTION, AS WELL AS TO MEET FUTURE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS.  THE CPUC RATEMAKING PROCESS PROVIDES GSWC WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOVER PRUDENTLY INCURRED CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS IN FUTURE FILINGS ASSOCIATED WITH ACHIEVING WATER QUALITY STANDARDS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT SUCH INCURRED AND EXPECTED FUTURE COSTS WILL BE AUTHORIZED FOR RECOVERY BY THE CPUC.  LEAD TESTING IN SCHOOLS  .  IN JANUARY 2017, THE CALIFORNIA STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD - DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER (DDW) ISSUED A PERMIT AMENDMENT THAT REQUIRES ALL COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS TO TEST THE SCHOOLS IN THEIR SERVICE AREA FOR LEAD, IF SAMPLING IS REQUESTED IN WRITING BY THE INSTITUTION\u2019S OFFICIALS. IN ADDITION, THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA SIGNED AN ASSEMBLY BILL, WHICH REQUIRES ALL COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS THAT SERVE A SCHOOL SITE OF A LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY WITH A BUILDING CONSTRUCTED BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2010, TO TEST FOR LEAD IN THE POTABLE WATER SYSTEM OF THE SCHOOL SITE ON OR BEFORE JULY 1, 2019. GSWC HAS BEEN WORKING  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EXTENSIVELY WITH THE SCHOOLS IN ITS SERVICE AREAS FOR THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. AS A RESULT OF CONCERTED OUTREACH TO THE SCHOOLS, GSWC HAS COMPLETED LEAD SAMPLING AT APPROXIMATELY 95 PERCENT OF THE SCHOOLS IN ITS SERVICE AREA AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE STATE AVERAGE OF 53 PERCENT. GSWC WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE REMAINING SCHOOLS IN ITS SERVICE AREAS TO MEET THE JULY 1, 2019 DEADLINE.  MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT IF ALL SCHOOLS WILL COOPERATE AND COMPLETE THE TESTING, AND AS A RESULT CANNOT PREDICT COMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH THIS REGULATION BY THE DEADLINE.

WATER SUPPLY  SEE  \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u2014CALIFORNIA DROUGHT\u201d  SECTION OF THE REGISTRANT\u2019S FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR-ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018  FOR A DISCUSSION OF WATER SUPPLY ISSUES.  THE DISCUSSION BELOW FOCUSES ON SIGNIFICANT MATTERS AND CHANGES SINCE DECEMBER 31,  2018.  DROUGHT IMPACT.  IN MAY 2018, THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE PASSED TWO BILLS THAT PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR LONG-TERM WATER-USE EFFICIENCY STANDARDS AND DROUGHT PLANNING AND RESILIENCY.  THE INITIAL STEPS FOR IMPLEMENTING THIS LEGISLATION HAVE BEEN LAID OUT IN A SUMMARY DOCUMENT BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES (\"DWR\") AND THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD (\"SWRCB\").  OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, STATE AGENCIES, WATER SUPPLIERS AND OTHER ENTITIES WILL BE WORKING TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS AND TIMELINESS OF PLAN IMPLEMENTATION.  A NOTABLE MILESTONE IS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDOOR WATER USE STANDARD OF 55 GALLONS PER CAPITA PER DAY (GPCD) UNTIL 2025, AT WHICH TIME THE STANDARD MAY BE REDUCED TO 52.5 GPCD OR A NEW STANDARD AS RECOMMEND BY DWR.  CALIFORNIA'S RECENT PERIOD OF MULTI-YEAR DROUGHT RESULTED IN REDUCED RECHARGE TO THE STATE'S GROUNDWATER BASINS.  GSWC UTILIZES GROUNDWATER FROM NUMEROUS GROUNDWATER BASINS THROUGHOUT THE STATE.  SEVERAL OF THESE BASINS, ESPECIALLY SMALLER BASINS, EXPERIENCED LOWER GROUNDWATER LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT.  SEVERAL OF GSWC'S SERVICE AREAS RELY ON GROUNDWATER AS THEIR ONLY SOURCE OF SUPPLY.  GIVEN THE CRITICAL NATURE OF THE GROUNDWATER LEVELS IN CALIFORNIA\u2019S CENTRAL COAST AREA, GSWC IMPLEMENTED MANDATORY WATER RESTRICTIONS IN CERTAIN SERVICE AREAS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH CPUC PROCEDURES.  IN THE EVENT OF WATER SUPPLY SHORTAGES BEYOND THE LOCALLY AVAILABLE SUPPLY, GSWC WOULD NEED TO TRANSPORT ADDITIONAL WATER FROM OTHER AREAS, INCREASING THE COST OF WATER SUPPLY.  THE 2017-2018 WATER YEAR WAS A DRY YEAR, WITH RAINFALL IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BEING BELOW NORMAL LEVELS.  HOWEVER, PRECIPITATION TO DATE IN 2019 HAS BEEN ABOVE NORMAL LEVELS, WITH NORTHERN SIERRA SNOWPACK AT 165% OF AVERAGE.  AS OF APRIL 30, 2019, THE U.S. DROUGHT MONITOR ESTIMATED THAT 6 PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA RANKS \u201cABNORMALLY DRY\u201d WITH NO PARTS OF THE STATE RANKED IN \u201cDROUGHT.\u201d  THIS IS IN COMPARISON TO APRIL 2018 WHEN APPROXIMATELY 66 PERCENT OF THE STATE WAS CONSIDERED \u201cABNORMALLY DRY,\u201d AND 37 PERCENT WAS IN THE RANK OF MODERATE DROUGHT.\u201d  METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT/ STATE WATER PROJECT  .  GSWC SUPPLEMENTS GROUNDWATER PRODUCTION WITH WHOLESALE PURCHASES FROM THE METROPOLITAN WATER DISTRICT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA (\"MWD\") MEMBER AGENCIES.  WATER SUPPLIES AVAILABLE TO THE MWD THROUGH THE STATE WATER PROJECT (\"SWP\") VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS.  EVERY YEAR, THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES (\"DWR\") ESTABLISHES THE SWP ALLOCATION FOR WATER DELIVERIES TO STATE WATER CONTRACTORS.  DWR GENERALLY ESTABLISHES A PERCENTAGE ALLOCATION OF DELIVERY REQUESTS BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING WEATHER PATTERNS, SNOW-PACK LEVELS, RESERVOIR LEVELS AND BIOLOGICAL DIVERSION RESTRICTIONS.  THE SWP IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF WATER FOR THE MWD.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, DWR SET AN INITIAL SWP DELIVERY ALLOCATION AT 35 PERCENT OF REQUESTS FOR THE 2019 CALENDAR YEAR. HOWEVER, DWR INCREASED THE ALLOCATION TO 70 PERCENT ON MARCH 20, 2019 DUE TO HIGHER THAN NORMAL PRECIPITATION AND SNOW PACK.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  REGISTRANT IS SUBJECT TO NEWLY ISSUED REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS CHANGES IN EXISTING REQUIREMENTS ISSUED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD.  DIFFERENCES IN FINANCIAL REPORTING BETWEEN PERIODS FOR GSWC COULD OCCUR UNLESS AND UNTIL THE CPUC APPROVES SUCH CHANGES FOR CONFORMITY THROUGH REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS.

EXCLUDING THE  UNFAVORABLE  FX IMPACT OF  $53 MILLION  , PRIMARILY IN SOUTH AMERICA, THIS  DECREASE  WAS DRIVEN BY.  \u2022  $63 MILLION IN EURASIA PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALE OF THE MASINLOC POWER PLANT IN MARCH 2018; AND  \u2022  $16 MILLION IN SOUTH AMERICA MAINLY DRIVEN BY LOWER GENERATION IN ARGENTINA AS WELL AS THE SALE OF ELECTRICA SANTIAGO AND THE TRANSMISSION LINES IN 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SPOT PRICES IN COLOMBIA AND SALES VOLUMES IN BRAZIL.  THESE UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $44 MILLION IN MCAC DRIVEN BY THE COMMENCEMENT OF OPERATIONS OF THE COLON COMBINED CYCLE FACILITY IN SEPTEMBER 2018.

LOWER COSTS IN ARGENTINA, AS A RESULT OF THE PESO DEVALUATION, CAUSED A NET  FAVORABLE  IMPACT TO FX OF  $3 MILLION  , WITH THE REMAINING  DECREASE  DRIVEN BY.  \u2022  $46 MILLION IN SOUTH AMERICA MOSTLY DUE TO THE DRIVERS DISCUSSED ABOVE;  \u2022  $28 MILLION IN MCAC DUE TO THE OUTAGE AT CHANGUINOLA AS A RESULT OF THE TUNNEL INSPECTION WORK AND LOWER HYDROLOGY IN PANAMA AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR; AND  \u2022  $23 MILLION IN EURASIA PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DRIVERS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  THESE UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $21 MILLION IN US AND UTILITIES MOSTLY DUE TO A REVISION TO THE ARO AT DPL AND THE 2018 RATE ORDER AT IPL.  26  SEE ITEM 2.\u2014  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \u2014  SBU PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS  OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR EACH SBU.

THIS  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOSSES OF $169 MILLION AT THE PARENT COMPANY IN 2018 RESULTING FROM THE REDEMPTION OF SENIOR NOTES COMPARED TO LOSSES OF $10 MILLION AT GENER IN 2019.  SEE NOTE  8  \u2014  DEBT  INCLUDED IN ITEM 1.\u2014  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GAINS ON INSURANCE RECOVERIES ASSOCIATED WITH PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE ANDRES FACILITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR EQUITY FUNDS USED DURING CONSTRUCTION AT IPALCO AS A RESULT OF DECREASED CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY.  OTHER EXPENSE  INCREASED  $3 MILLION  , OR  33%  , TO  $12 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $9 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  WITH NO MATERIAL DRIVERS.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED NET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION  LOSSES  OF  $4 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOSSES AT THE PARENT COMPANY RESULTING FROM THE DEPRECIATION OF INTERCOMPANY RECEIVABLES DENOMINATED IN EUROS.  27  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED NET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION  LOSSES  OF  $19 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DEVALUATION OF THE ARGENTINE PESO, LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES RELATED TO ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT RECEIVABLES, AND MARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES ON FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVES IN COLOMBIA. THESE LOSSES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS AT THE PARENT COMPANY DUE TO THE APPRECIATION OF INTERCOMPANY RECEIVABLES DENOMINATED IN EUROS AND THE BRITISH POUND.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  DECREASED  $116 MILLION  , OR  50%  , TO  $115 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $231 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE  32%  AND  23%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THIS NET  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 2018 IMPACT OF THE SALE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ENTIRE 51% EQUITY INTEREST IN MASINLOC. SEE NOTE  18  \u2014  HELD-FOR-SALE AND DISPOSITIONS  AND  NOTE  16  \u2014  INCOME TAXES  INCLUDED IN ITEM 1.\u2014  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR DETAILS AND IMPACTS OF THE SALE.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REFLECTS THE TAX EFFECT OF SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WHICH ARE GENERALLY TAXED AT RATES DIFFERENT THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE OF 21%. FURTHERMORE, OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS MAY BE SUBJECTED TO INCREMENTAL U.S. TAXATION UNDER THE GILTI RULES. A FUTURE PROPORTIONATE CHANGE IN THE COMPOSITION OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES FROM FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC TAX JURISDICTIONS COULD IMPACT OUR PERIODIC EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  NET EQUITY IN EARNINGS (LOSSES) OF AFFILIATES  NET EQUITY IN EARNINGS (LOSSES) OF AFFILIATES  DECREASED  $17 MILLION  TO A LOSS OF  $6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO EARNINGS OF  $11 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THIS  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED EARNINGS AT SPOWER DRIVEN BY 2018 UNREALIZED DERIVATIVE GAINS AND HIGHER 2019 INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO THE TIMING OF COMPLETED PROJECTS, THE SALE OF ELSTA IN Q3 2018, AND DECREASED EARNINGS AT DISTRIBUTED ENERGY DRIVEN BY THE ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN OF OUR NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN LATE 2018.

THIS  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO.  \u2022  LOWER EARNINGS DUE TO THE SALE OF MASINLOC IN MARCH 2018; AND  \u2022  LOWER EARNINGS IN PANAMA PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER HYDROLOGY AND THE OUTAGE AT CHANGUINOLA AS A RESULT OF THE TUNNEL INSPECTION.

THIS  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO.  \u2022  PRIOR YEAR GAIN ON SALE OF MASINLOC, NET OF TAX; AND  \u2022  LOWER MARGINS AT OUR SOUTH AMERICA, MCAC AND EURASIA SBUS.  THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY.  \u2022  PRIOR YEAR LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT AT THE PARENT COMPANY;  \u2022  HIGHER MARGINS AT OUR US AND UTILITIES SBU; AND  \u2022  CURRENT PERIOD GAINS ON INSURANCE PROCEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIGHTNING INCIDENT AT THE ANDRES FACILITY IN 2018.  SBU PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS  NON-GAAP MEASURES  ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN, ADJUSTED PTC AND ADJUSTED EPS ARE NON-GAAP SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES THAT ARE USED BY MANAGEMENT AND EXTERNAL USERS OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SUCH AS INVESTORS, INDUSTRY ANALYSTS AND LENDERS.  28  ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN  WE DEFINE ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN AS OPERATING MARGIN, ADJUSTED FOR THE IMPACT OF NCI, EXCLUDING (A) UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS; (B) BENEFITS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DISPOSITIONS AND ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESS INTERESTS, INCLUDING EARLY PLANT CLOSURES; AND (C) COSTS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH A MAJOR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WORKFORCE REDUCTION EFFORTS, RELOCATIONS, AND OFFICE CONSOLIDATION. THE ALLOCATION OF HLBV EARNINGS TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IS NOT ADJUSTED OUT OF ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN. SEE  REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FOR THE DEFINITION OF OPERATING MARGIN.  THE GAAP MEASURE MOST COMPARABLE TO ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN IS OPERATING MARGIN. WE BELIEVE THAT ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN BETTER REFLECTS THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY. FACTORS IN THIS DETERMINATION INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF NCI, WHERE AES CONSOLIDATES THE RESULTS OF A SUBSIDIARY THAT IS NOT WHOLLY OWNED BY THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS THE VARIABILITY DUE TO UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND STRATEGIC DECISIONS TO DISPOSE OF OR ACQUIRE BUSINESS INTERESTS. ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO OPERATING MARGIN, WHICH IS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

ADJUSTED PTC  WE DEFINE ADJUSTED PTC AS  PRE-TAX INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION EXCLUDING GAINS OR LOSSES OF THE CONSOLIDATED ENTITY DUE TO (A) UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND EQUITY SECURITIES; (B) UNREALIZED FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS OR LOSSES; (C) GAINS, LOSSES, BENEFITS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DISPOSITIONS AND ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESS INTERESTS, INCLUDING EARLY PLANT CLOSURES; (D) LOSSES DUE TO IMPAIRMENTS; (E) GAINS, LOSSES AND COSTS DUE TO THE EARLY RETIREMENT OF DEBT; AND (F) COSTS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH A MAJOR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WORKFORCE REDUCTION EFFORTS, RELOCATIONS, AND OFFICE CONSOLIDATION.  ADJUSTED PTC ALSO INCLUDES NET EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF AFFILIATES ON AN AFTER-TAX BASIS ADJUSTED FOR THE SAME GAINS OR LOSSES EXCLUDED FROM CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES.  ADJUSTED PTC REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF NCI AND EXCLUDES THE ITEMS SPECIFIED IN THE DEFINITION ABOVE. IN ADDITION TO THE REVENUE AND COST OF SALES REFLECTED IN OPERATING MARGIN, ADJUSTED PTC INCLUDES THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF OUR INCOME STATEMENT, SUCH AS  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  IN THE CORPORATE SEGMENT, AS WELL AS BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COSTS,  INTEREST EXPENSE  AND  INTEREST INCOME,  OTHER EXPENSE  AND  OTHER INCOME,  REALIZED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES,  AND  NET EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF AFFILIATES.  THE GAAP MEASURE MOST COMPARABLE TO ADJUSTED PTC IS  INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO  29  THE AES CORPORATION  . WE BELIEVE THAT ADJUSTED PTC BETTER REFLECTS THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY AND IS THE MOST RELEVANT MEASURE CONSIDERED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERNAL EVALUATION OF THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF ITS SEGMENTS. FACTORS IN THIS DETERMINATION INCLUDE THE VARIABILITY DUE TO UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS OR EQUITY SECURITIES REMEASUREMENT, UNREALIZED FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS OR LOSSES, LOSSES DUE TO IMPAIRMENTS AND STRATEGIC DECISIONS TO DISPOSE OF OR ACQUIRE BUSINESS INTERESTS, RETIRE DEBT OR IMPLEMENT RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES, WHICH AFFECT RESULTS IN A GIVEN PERIOD OR PERIODS. IN ADDITION, EARNINGS BEFORE TAX REPRESENTS THE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY BEFORE THE APPLICATION OF STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATES AND TAX ADJUSTMENTS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF TAX PLANNING, CORRESPONDING TO THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES. GIVEN ITS LARGE NUMBER OF BUSINESSES AND COMPLEXITY, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT ADJUSTED PTC IS A MORE TRANSPARENT MEASURE THAT BETTER ASSISTS INVESTORS IN DETERMINING WHICH BUSINESSES HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS.  ADJUSTED PTC SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO  INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION  , WHICH IS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THAT IMPROVED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AT CERTAIN BUSINESSES, GROWTH FROM NEW BUSINESSES AND GLOBAL COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES MAY LESSEN OR OFFSET THEIR IMPACT. IF THESE FAVORABLE EFFECTS DO NOT OCCUR, OR IF THE CHALLENGES DESCRIBED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS SECTION IMPACT US MORE SIGNIFICANTLY THAN WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE, OR IF VOLATILE FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES MOVE MORE UNFAVORABLY, THEN THESE ADVERSE FACTORS (OR OTHER ADVERSE FACTORS UNKNOWN TO US) MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING MARGIN, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION, AND CASH FLOWS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR OPERATIONS AND ADDRESS CHALLENGES AS THEY ARISE. FOR THE RISK FACTORS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, SEE ITEM 1.  \u2014BUSINESS  AND ITEM 1A.  \u2014RISK FACTORS  OF OUR  2018  FORM 10-K.  MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL  DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS, SOME COUNTRIES WHERE OUR SUBSIDIARIES CONDUCT BUSINESS HAVE EXPERIENCED MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGES. IN THE EVENT THESE TRENDS CONTINUE, THERE COULD BE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESSES.  UNITED STATES TAX LAW REFORM  \u2014 IN LIGHT OF THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX SYSTEM ENACTED IN 2017, THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE HAVE ISSUED NUMEROUS REGULATIONS. WHILE CERTAIN REGULATIONS ARE NOW FINAL, THERE ARE MANY REGULATIONS THAT ARE PROPOSED AND STILL OTHERS ANTICIPATED TO BE ISSUED IN PROPOSED FORM. THE FINAL VERSION OF ANY REGULATIONS MAY VARY FROM THE PROPOSED FORM. WHEN FINAL, THESE REGULATIONS MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. CERTAIN OF THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS, WHEN FINAL, MAY HAVE RETROACTIVE EFFECT TO JANUARY 1, 2018 OR JANUARY 1, 2019.  PUERTO RICO  \u2014 AS DISCUSSED IN ITEM 7\u2014  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \u2014  KEY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES  OF THE  2018  FORM 10-K, OUR SUBSIDIARIES IN PUERTO RICO HAVE A LONG-TERM PPA WITH STATE-OWNED PREPA, WHICH HAS BEEN FACING ECONOMIC CHALLENGES THAT COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS IN PUERTO RICO.  AES PUERTO RICO AND AES ILUMINA\u2019S NON-RECOURSE DEBT OF  $311 MILLION  AND  $34 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, CONTINUE TO BE IN DEFAULT AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AS A RESULT OF PREPA \u0301S BANKRUPTCY FILING IN JULY 2017. THE COMPANY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS DEBT PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019.  THE COMPANY'S RECEIVABLE BALANCES IN PUERTO RICO AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  TOTALED $70 MILLION, OF WHICH $20 MILLION WAS OVERDUE. DESPITE THE TITLE III PROTECTION, PREPA HAS BEEN MAKING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS PAYMENTS TO THE GENERATORS IN LINE WITH HISTORICAL PAYMENT PATTERNS.  ON APRIL 11, 2019, THE GOVERNOR OF PUERTO RICO SIGNED THE PUERTO RICO ENERGY PUBLIC POLICY ACT (\u201cTHE ACT\u201d) INTO LAW. THE ACT ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES FOR GRID EFFICIENCY AND INCLUDES THE ELIMINATION OF COAL AS A SOURCE FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION BY JANUARY 1, 2028. THE ACT SUPPORTS THE ACCELERATED DEPLOYMENT OF RENEWABLES THROUGH THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD AND THE CONVERSION OF COAL GENERATING FACILITIES TO OTHER FUEL SOURCES, WITH COMPLIANCE TARGETS OF 40% BY 2025, 60% BY 2040, AND 100% BY 2050. AES PUERTO RICO\u2019S LONG-TERM PPA WITH PREPA EXPIRES NOVEMBER 31, 2027. WE ARE CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVES ALLOWED UNDER THE LAW AND EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. CONSIDERING THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS OF THE FILING DATE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR ASSETS IN PUERTO RICO OF $607 MILLION IS RECOVERABLE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019.  ARGENTINA  \u2014 ON FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THE SECRETARY OF ENERGY IN ARGENTINA ISSUED RESOLUTION 1/2019 THAT MODIFIED THE REMUNERATION SCHEME FOR THERMAL GENERATORS AS PREVIOUSLY INTRODUCED BY RESOLUTION 19/2017. THE ENTRANCE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AND EFFICIENT THERMAL GENERATORS IN THE MARKET OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS SUPPORTED THE REDUCTION OF SYSTEM COSTS AND EFFICIENCY WHILE FOSTERING COMPETITION. CAPACITY PRICES FOR THERMAL GENERATORS WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE ACTUAL DISPATCH OF THE GENERATING FACILITIES. UNDER RESOLUTION 1/2019, THE REMUNERATION FOR ENERGY IS REDUCED BY $1.6 PER MWH FOR ALL THERMAL GENERATION COMPARED TO RESOLUTION 19/2017. FOR HYDROELECTRIC GENERATION, THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN CAPACITY OR ENERGY PRICES. THESE MEASURES ARE INTENDED TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT OF ARGENTINA REDUCE THE SUBSIDIES AND THE FINANCIAL DEFICIT OF THE ELECTRIC MARKET.  UNITED KINGDOM  \u2014 IN JUNE 2016, THE UK HELD A REFERENDUM IN WHICH VOTERS APPROVED AN EXIT FROM THE EU, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS \u201cBREXIT.\u201d THE UK PARLIAMENT HAS REJECTED, ON THREE OCCASIONS, PROPOSED WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENTS THAT THE EU HAD SUPPORTED. THE UK WAS ORIGINALLY EXPECTED TO EXIT THE EU ON MARCH 29, 2019, WHICH HAS BEEN DELAYED TO OCTOBER 31, 2019. WHILE THE FULL IMPACT OF BREXIT REMAINS UNCERTAIN, THESE CHANGES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS.  33  REGULATORY  IN SEPTEMBER 2018, DP&L RECEIVED AN ORDER FROM PUCO ESTABLISHING NEW BASE DISTRIBUTION RATES FOR DP&L. UNDER THE APPROVED TERMS OF THE ORDER, DP&L AGREED TO FILE AN APPLICATION WITH PUCO TO REFUND CUSTOMERS ELIGIBLE EXCESS ACCUMULATED DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TCJA AND ANY RELATED REGULATORY LIABILITY. DP&L FILED THIS APPLICATION ON MARCH 1, 2019 AND PROPOSED TO RETURN A TOTAL OF $65 MILLION TO CUSTOMERS. THE TIMING AND FINAL AMOUNT TO BE RETURNED TO CUSTOMERS IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES  WE OPERATE IN MULTIPLE COUNTRIES AND AS SUCH ARE SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY IN EXCHANGE RATES AT VARYING DEGREES AT THE SUBSIDIARY LEVEL AND BETWEEN OUR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, THE USD, AND CURRENCIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THERE WAS CONTINUED SIGNIFICANT DEVALUATION IN THE ARGENTINE PESO AGAINST THE USD. FURTHER MATERIAL DEVALUATION OF THE ARGENTINE PESO AGAINST THE USD COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR FULL YEAR  2019  RESULTS, LARGELY IN LOCAL TAX EXPENSE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO ITEM 3.\u2014  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  ANDRES  AS DISCUSSED IN ITEM 7\u2014  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \u2014  KEY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES  OF THE  2018  FORM 10-K, ON SEPTEMBER 3, 2018, LIGHTNING AFFECTED THE ANDRES 319 MW COMBINED CYCLE NATURAL GAS FACILITY IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC (\u201cTHE PLANT\u201d) RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO ITS STEAM TURBINE AND GENERATOR. THE COMPANY HAS BUSINESS INTERRUPTION AND PROPERTY DAMAGE INSURANCE COVERAGE, SUBJECT TO PRE-DEFINED DEDUCTIBLES, UNDER ITS EXISTING PROGRAMS.  ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2018, THE PLANT RESTARTED OPERATIONS RUNNING THE GAS TURBINE IN SIMPLE CYCLE AT PARTIAL LOAD OF APPROXIMATELY 120 MW. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THAT THE PLANT WILL BEGIN OPERATING THE GAS TURBINE IN SIMPLE CYCLE AT FULL LOAD OF APPROXIMATELY 185 MW STARTING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, AND IN COMBINED CYCLE AT FULL CAPACITY BY THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE REDUCED CAPACITY IN THE LOCAL ENERGY MARKET, THE COMPANY INSTALLED 120 MW OF RENTAL POWER (GAS TURBINES) UNTIL THE COMBINED CYCLE FACILITY IS AT FULL LOAD. THE RENTAL UNITS WERE FULLY OPERATIONAL BEGINNING IN DECEMBER 2018.  CONSIDERING THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS OF THE FILING DATE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS IN ANDRES OF $418 MILLION IS RECOVERABLE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019.  CHANGUINOLA TUNNEL LEAK  AS DISCUSSED IN ITEM 7\u2014  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \u2014  KEY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES  OF THE  2018  FORM 10-K, INCREASED WATER LEVELS WERE NOTED IN A CREEK NEAR THE CHANGUINOLA POWER PLANT, A 223 MW HYDROELECTRIC POWER FACILITY IN PANAMA. AFTER THE COMPLETION OF AN ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY HAS CONFIRMED LOSS OF WATER IN SPECIFIC SECTIONS OF THE TUNNEL. TO ENSURE THE LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF THE FACILITY, THE AFFECTED UNITS OF THE PLANT HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE UNTIL FINAL INSPECTION AND REPLACEMENT OF THE DAMAGED SECTIONS OF TUNNEL IS COMPLETE. THIS PROCESS BEGAN IN JANUARY 2019 AND MAY TAKE UP TO 10 MONTHS TO COMPLETE. THE COMPANY HAS NOTIFIED ITS INSURERS OF A POTENTIAL CLAIM AND HAS ASSERTED CLAIMS AGAINST ITS CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE OF COLLECTION AND THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE SITUATION. THE COMPANY HAS NOT IDENTIFIED ANY INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT AND BELIEVES THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSET GROUP OF $933 MILLION IS RECOVERABLE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019.  IMPAIRMENTS  EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY NECESSITATE RECOVERABILITY TESTS AND POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS OR GOODWILL MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN POWER PRICES OR FUEL COSTS, INCREASED COMPETITION DUE TO ADDITIONAL CAPACITY IN THE GRID, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS, DECLINING TRENDS IN DEMAND, OR AN EXPECTATION IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THE ASSET WILL BE DISPOSED OF BEFORE THE END OF ITS ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.  ENVIRONMENTAL  THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THE COMPANY FACES CERTAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING EXISTING AND POTENTIAL GHG LEGISLATION OR REGULATIONS, AND ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO WATER DISCHARGES, WASTE MANAGEMENT (INCLUDING DISPOSAL OF COAL COMBUSTION RESIDUALS) AND CERTAIN AIR EMISSIONS, SUCH AS SO  2  , NO  X  , PARTICULATE MATTER, MERCURY AND OTHER HAZARDOUS AIR POLLUTANTS. SUCH RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES COULD RESULT IN INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OTHER COMPLIANCE COSTS WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON CERTAIN OF OUR U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES AND OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR  34  FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THESE RISKS, SEE ITEM 1A.\u2014  RISK FACTORS\u2014OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE LAW OR REGULATORY SCHEMES; SEVERAL OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT REMEDIATION EXPENSES, ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVES, PRIVATE PARTY LAWSUITS AND REPUTATIONAL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CCR; OUR BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO STRINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS;  AND  CONCERNS ABOUT GHG EMISSIONS AND THE POTENTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE LED TO INCREASED REGULATION AND OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES  INCLUDED IN THE  2018  FORM 10-K.  CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  OVERVIEW  \u2014  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $1.4 BILLION  , OF WHICH  $34 MILLION  WAS HELD AT THE PARENT COMPANY AND QUALIFIED HOLDING COMPANIES. THE COMPANY ALSO HAD  $378 MILLION  IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, HELD PRIMARILY AT SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, WE HAD RESTRICTED CASH AND DEBT SERVICE RESERVES OF  $949 MILLION  . THE COMPANY ALSO HAD NON-RECOURSE AND RECOURSE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS OF DEBT OUTSTANDING OF  $15.8 BILLION  AND  $3.9 BILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. OF THE APPROXIMATELY  $1.3 BILLION  OF OUR CURRENT NON-RECOURSE DEBT,  $920 MILLION  WAS PRESENTED AS SUCH BECAUSE IT IS DUE IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AND  $345 MILLION  RELATES TO DEBT CONSIDERED IN DEFAULT DUE TO COVENANT VIOLATIONS. NONE OF THE DEFAULTS ARE PAYMENT DEFAULTS, BUT ARE INSTEAD TECHNICAL DEFAULTS TRIGGERED BY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH OTHER COVENANTS OR OTHER CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THE NON-RECOURSE DEBT DOCUMENTS DUE TO THE BANKRUPTCY OF THE OFFTAKER.  WE EXPECT CURRENT MATURITIES OF NON-RECOURSE DEBT TO BE REPAID FROM NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF THE SUBSIDIARY TO WHICH THE DEBT RELATES, THROUGH OPPORTUNISTIC REFINANCING ACTIVITY, OR SOME COMBINATION THEREOF. WE HAVE  $5 MILLION  OF RECOURSE DEBT WHICH MATURES WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY ELECT TO REPURCHASE OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT THROUGH CASH PURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS OR OTHERWISE WHEN MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT SUCH SECURITIES ARE ATTRACTIVELY PRICED. SUCH REPURCHASES, IF ANY, WILL DEPEND ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE AMOUNTS INVOLVED IN ANY SUCH REPURCHASES MAY BE MATERIAL.  WE RELY MAINLY ON LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS TO FUND OUR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE, TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE AT ACCEPTABLE TERMS, UTILIZED NON-RECOURSE DEBT TO FUND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND INVESTMENTS REQUIRED TO CONSTRUCT AND ACQUIRE OUR ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS, DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES AND RELATED ASSETS. OUR NON-RECOURSE FINANCING IS DESIGNED TO LIMIT CROSS-DEFAULT RISK TO THE PARENT COMPANY OR OTHER SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES. OUR NON-RECOURSE LONG-TERM DEBT IS A COMBINATION OF FIXED AND VARIABLE INTEREST RATE INSTRUMENTS. DEBT IS TYPICALLY DENOMINATED IN THE CURRENCY THAT MATCHES THE CURRENCY OF THE REVENUE EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED FROM THE BENEFITING PROJECT, THEREBY REDUCING CURRENCY RISK. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE CURRENCY IS MATCHED THROUGH THE USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR NON-RECOURSE DEBT IS FUNDED BY INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANKS, WITH DEBT CAPACITY SUPPLEMENTED BY MULTILATERALS AND LOCAL REGIONAL BANKS.  GIVEN OUR LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK ON DEBT BALANCES THAT ACCRUE INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES. WHEN POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY WILL BORROW FUNDS AT FIXED INTEREST RATES OR HEDGE ITS VARIABLE RATE DEBT TO FIX ITS INTEREST COSTS ON SUCH OBLIGATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY TRIED TO MAINTAIN AT LEAST 70% OF ITS CONSOLIDATED LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS AT FIXED INTEREST RATES, INCLUDING FIXING THE INTEREST RATE THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS. THESE EFFORTS APPLY TO THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE SWAPS COMPARED TO THE AMOUNT OF RELATED UNDERLYING DEBT. PRESENTLY, THE PARENT COMPANY\u2019S ONLY MATERIAL UNHEDGED EXPOSURE TO VARIABLE INTEREST RATE DEBT RELATES TO INDEBTEDNESS UNDER ITS  $365 MILLION  OUTSTANDING SECURED TERM LOAN DUE 2022 AND DRAWINGS OF  $245 MILLION  UNDER ITS SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY. ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, OF THE COMPANY\u2019S  $20.1 BILLION  OF TOTAL GROSS DEBT OUTSTANDING AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY  $2.3 BILLION  BORE INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES THAT WERE NOT SUBJECT TO A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT WHICH FIXED THE INTEREST RATE. BRAZIL HOLDS  $1 BILLION  OF OUR FLOATING RATE NON-RECOURSE EXPOSURE AS WE HAVE NO ABILITY TO FIX LOCAL DEBT INTEREST RATES EFFICIENTLY.  IN ADDITION TO UTILIZING NON-RECOURSE DEBT AT A SUBSIDIARY LEVEL WHEN AVAILABLE, THE PARENT COMPANY PROVIDES A PORTION, OR IN CERTAIN INSTANCES ALL, OF THE REMAINING LONG-TERM FINANCING OR CREDIT REQUIRED TO FUND DEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTION OR ACQUISITION OF A PARTICULAR PROJECT. THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE GENERALLY TAKEN THE FORM OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS OR INTERCOMPANY LOANS, WHICH ARE SUBORDINATED TO THE PROJECT\u2019S NON-RECOURSE LOANS. WE GENERALLY OBTAIN THE FUNDS FOR THESE INVESTMENTS FROM OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES OF ASSETS AND/OR THE PROCEEDS FROM OUR ISSUANCES OF DEBT, COMMON STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES. SIMILARLY, IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES, THE PARENT COMPANY MAY PROVIDE FINANCIAL GUARANTEES OR OTHER CREDIT SUPPORT FOR THE BENEFIT OF COUNTERPARTIES WHO HAVE ENTERED INTO CONTRACTS FOR THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF ELECTRICITY, EQUIPMENT, OR OTHER SERVICES WITH OUR SUBSIDIARIES OR LENDERS. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, IF A BUSINESS DEFAULTS ON ITS PAYMENT OR SUPPLY OBLIGATION, THE PARENT COMPANY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BUSINESS\u2019 OBLIGATIONS UP TO THE AMOUNT PROVIDED FOR IN THE RELEVANT GUARANTEE OR OTHER CREDIT SUPPORT. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE PARENT COMPANY HAD PROVIDED OUTSTANDING FINANCIAL AND  35  PERFORMANCE-RELATED GUARANTEES OR OTHER CREDIT SUPPORT COMMITMENTS TO OR FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR BUSINESSES, WHICH WERE LIMITED BY THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENTS, OF APPROXIMATELY  $660 MILLION  IN AGGREGATE (EXCLUDING THOSE COLLATERALIZED BY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS DISCUSSED BELOW).  AS A RESULT OF THE PARENT COMPANY\u2019S BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE RATING, COUNTERPARTIES MAY BE UNWILLING TO ACCEPT OUR GENERAL UNSECURED COMMITMENTS TO PROVIDE CREDIT SUPPORT. ACCORDINGLY, WITH RESPECT TO BOTH NEW AND EXISTING COMMITMENTS, THE PARENT COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SOME OTHER FORM OF ASSURANCE, SUCH AS A LETTER OF CREDIT, TO BACKSTOP OR REPLACE OUR CREDIT SUPPORT. THE PARENT COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE ASSURANCES TO SUCH COUNTERPARTIES. TO THE EXTENT WE ARE REQUIRED AND ABLE TO PROVIDE LETTERS OF CREDIT OR OTHER COLLATERAL TO SUCH COUNTERPARTIES, THIS WILL REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT AVAILABLE TO US TO MEET OUR OTHER LIQUIDITY NEEDS. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  $368 MILLION  IN LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING PROVIDED UNDER OUR UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY AND  $80 MILLION  IN LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING PROVIDED UNDER OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY. THESE LETTERS OF CREDIT OPERATE TO GUARANTEE PERFORMANCE RELATING TO CERTAIN PROJECT DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY PAID LETTER OF CREDIT FEES RANGING FROM  1%  TO  3%  PER ANNUM ON THE OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS.  WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO SEEK, WHERE POSSIBLE, NON-RECOURSE DEBT FINANCING IN CONNECTION WITH THE ASSETS OR BUSINESSES THAT WE OR OUR AFFILIATES MAY DEVELOP, CONSTRUCT OR ACQUIRE. HOWEVER, DEPENDING ON LOCAL AND GLOBAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES, NON-RECOURSE DEBT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE TERMS OR AT ALL. IF WE DECIDE NOT TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING OR CREDIT SUPPORT TO A SUBSIDIARY PROJECT THAT IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION OR HAS NEAR-TERM DEBT PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AND THAT SUBSIDIARY IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL NON-RECOURSE DEBT, SUCH SUBSIDIARY MAY BECOME INSOLVENT, AND WE MAY LOSE OUR INVESTMENT IN THAT SUBSIDIARY. ADDITIONALLY, IF ANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES LOSE A SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER, THE SUBSIDIARY MAY NEED TO WITHDRAW FROM A PROJECT OR RESTRUCTURE THE NON-RECOURSE DEBT FINANCING. IF WE OR THE SUBSIDIARY CHOOSE NOT TO PROCEED WITH A PROJECT OR ARE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE A RESTRUCTURING OF THE NON-RECOURSE DEBT, WE MAY LOSE OUR INVESTMENT IN THAT SUBSIDIARY.  MANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES DEPEND ON TIMELY AND CONTINUED ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS TO MANAGE THEIR LIQUIDITY NEEDS. THE INABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL ON FAVORABLE TERMS, TO REFINANCE EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS OR TO FUND OPERATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS DURING TIMES OF POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY MAY HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN THE TIMING OF TARIFF INCREASES OR DELAYS IN THE REGULATORY DETERMINATIONS UNDER THE RELEVANT CONCESSIONS COULD AFFECT THE CASH FLOWS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESSES.  LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES  \u2014 AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY  $110 MILLION  OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CLASSIFIED AS  NONCURRENT ASSETS\u2014OTHER  . THESE NONCURRENT RECEIVABLES MOSTLY CONSIST OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN ARGENTINA THAT, PURSUANT TO AMENDED AGREEMENTS OR GOVERNMENT RESOLUTIONS, HAVE COLLECTION PERIODS THAT EXTEND BEYOND  MARCH 31,  2020  , OR ONE YEAR FROM THE LATEST BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE MAJORITY OF ARGENTINIAN RECEIVABLES HAVE BEEN CONVERTED INTO LONG-TERM FINANCING FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF POWER PLANTS.

AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN THE CHART ABOVE INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, WHERE APPLICABLE.  37  \u2022  ADJUSTED NET INCOME WAS ESSENTIALLY FLAT COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u2022  WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DECREASED BY  $181 MILLION  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS AT GENER, HIGHER COLLECTIONS OF OVERDUE RECEIVABLES FROM DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, COLLECTIONS OF BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE PROCEEDS AT ANDRES DUE TO THE STEAM TURBINE DAMAGE CLAIM FROM 2018, AND LOWER INTEREST PAYMENTS AT THE PARENT COMPANY. THESE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE TIMING OF VAT PAYMENTS AT GENER.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DECREASED  BY  $1.1 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  INVESTING CASH FLOWS  (IN MILLIONS)  \u2022  PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSITIONS DECREASED BY  $1.2 BILLION  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALES OF MASINLOC AND THE DPL PEAKER ASSETS IN 2018.  \u2022  CASH USED FOR SHORT-TERM INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY  $126 MILLION  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PRIOR YEAR PURCHASES OF NON-CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES AT TIETE\u0302 TO PROVIDE PROJECT FINANCING FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BAURU SOLAR COMPLEX.  \u2022  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCREASED BY  $9 MILLION  , DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  (IN MILLIONS)  38  \u2022  GROWTH EXPENDITURES DECREASED BY  $36 MILLION  , PRIMARILY DUE TO TIMING OF PAYMENTS FOR THE SOUTHLAND RE-POWERING PROJECT, COMPLETION OF THE COLON COMBINED CYCLE FACILITY IN 2018, AND THE SALE OF MASINLOC IN 2018. THESE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SPENDING AT ALTO MAIPO AS A RESULT OF THE STRABAG AGREEMENT EXECUTED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 FOR CONSTRUCTION FINANCING.  \u2022  MAINTENANCE EXPENDITURES INCREASED BY  $49 MILLION  , PRIMARILY AT ANDRES AS A RESULT OF THE STEAM TURBINE LIGHTNING DAMAGE, AND AT IPALCO DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS FOR OUTAGE RELATED EXPENSES.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $1 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.

PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS INCLUDED AS A USEFUL MEASURE OF THE LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE TO THE AES CORPORATION, OR THE PARENT COMPANY, GIVEN THE NON-RECOURSE NATURE OF MOST OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS. PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY AS OUTLINED BELOW IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS,  WHICH IS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AT THE PARENT COMPANY LEVEL ARE DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING REFINANCING PROCEEDS, PROCEEDS FROM DEBT AND EQUITY FINANCINGS AT THE PARENT COMPANY LEVEL, INCLUDING AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, AND PROCEEDS FROM ASSET SALES. CASH REQUIREMENTS AT THE PARENT COMPANY LEVEL ARE PRIMARILY TO FUND INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF DEBT, CONSTRUCTION COMMITMENTS, OTHER EQUITY COMMITMENTS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS, TAXES, PARENT COMPANY OVERHEAD AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, AND DIVIDENDS ON COMMON STOCK.  THE COMPANY DEFINES PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY AS CASH AVAILABLE TO THE PARENT COMPANY PLUS AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER EXISTING CREDIT FACILITY PLUS CASH AT QUALIFIED HOLDING COMPANIES. THE CASH HELD AT QUALIFIED HOLDING COMPANIES REPRESENTS CASH SENT TO SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY DOMICILED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. SUCH SUBSIDIARIES HAVE NO CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO SEND CASH TO THE PARENT COMPANY. PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY IS RECONCILED TO ITS MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE,  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  , AT THE PERIODS INDICATED AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).  39  MARCH 31, 2019  DECEMBER 31, 2018  CONSOLIDATED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $1,426  $1,166  LESS: CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT SUBSIDIARIES  (1,392  )  (1,142  )  PARENT COMPANY AND QUALIFIED HOLDING COMPANIES\u2019 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  34  24  COMMITMENTS UNDER PARENT COMPANY CREDIT FACILITY  1,100  1,100  LESS: LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY  (80  )  (78  )  LESS: BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY  (245  )  \u2014  BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER PARENT COMPANY CREDIT FACILITY  775  1,022  TOTAL PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY  $809  $1,046  THE COMPANY UTILIZES ITS PARENT COMPANY CREDIT FACILITY FOR SHORT TERM CASH NEEDS TO BRIDGE TIMING OF DISTRIBUTIONS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THE COMPANY IS EXPECTING THAT THE PARENT COMPANY CREDIT FACILITIES\u2019 BORROWINGS WILL BE REPAID BY THE END OF YEAR, BUT CAN MAKE NO ASSURANCES THIS WILL OCCUR AS CURRENTLY FORECASTED.  THE PARENT COMPANY PAID DIVIDENDS OF  $0.1365  PER SHARE TO ITS COMMON STOCKHOLDERS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  FOR DIVIDENDS DECLARED IN DECEMBER 2018. WHILE WE INTEND TO CONTINUE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AND BELIEVE WE WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO DO SO, WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO PAY DIVIDENDS, OR IF CONTINUED, THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DIVIDENDS.  RECOURSE DEBT  OUR TOTAL RECOURSE DEBT WAS  $3.9 BILLION  AND  $3.7 BILLION  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE  8  \u2014  DEBT  IN ITEM 1.\u2014  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  OF THIS FORM 10-Q AND NOTE 10\u2014  DEBT  IN ITEM 8.\u2014  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA  OF OUR  2018  FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL DETAIL.  WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR NEEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, THIS BELIEF IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF MATERIAL ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS, THE OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, POWER MARKET POOL PRICES, AND THE ABILITY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS. IN ADDITION, OUR SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 ABILITY TO DECLARE AND PAY CASH DIVIDENDS TO US (AT THE PARENT COMPANY LEVEL) IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS CONTAINED IN LOANS, GOVERNMENTAL PROVISIONS AND OTHER AGREEMENTS. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE SOURCES WILL BE AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED OR THAT THE ACTUAL CASH REQUIREMENTS WILL NOT BE GREATER THAN ANTICIPATED. WE HAVE MET OUR INTERIM NEEDS FOR SHORTER-TERM AND WORKING CAPITAL FINANCING AT THE PARENT COMPANY LEVEL WITH OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY. SEE ITEM 1A.\u2014  RISK FACTORS  \u2014  THE AES CORPORATION IS A HOLDING COMPANY AND ITS ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON ITS OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS, INCLUDING ITS PUBLIC DEBT SECURITIES, IS DEPENDENT UPON THE RECEIPT OF FUNDS FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES BY WAY OF DIVIDENDS, FEES, INTEREST, LOANS OR OTHERWISE  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S  2018  FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  VARIOUS DEBT INSTRUMENTS AT THE PARENT COMPANY LEVEL, INCLUDING OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY, CONTAIN CERTAIN RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS. THE COVENANTS PROVIDE FOR, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, LIMITATIONS ON OTHER INDEBTEDNESS, LIENS, INVESTMENTS AND GUARANTEES; LIMITATIONS ON DIVIDENDS, STOCK REPURCHASES AND OTHER EQUITY TRANSACTIONS; RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, SALES OF ASSETS, LEASES, TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET AND DERIVATIVE ARRANGEMENTS; MAINTENANCE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL RATIOS; AND FINANCIAL AND OTHER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AT THE PARENT COMPANY LEVEL.  NON-RECOURSE DEBT  WHILE THE LENDERS UNDER OUR NON-RECOURSE DEBT FINANCINGS GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE DIRECT RECOURSE TO THE PARENT COMPANY, DEFAULTS THEREUNDER CAN STILL HAVE IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION.  \u2022  REDUCING OUR CASH FLOWS AS THE SUBSIDIARY WILL TYPICALLY BE PROHIBITED FROM DISTRIBUTING CASH TO THE PARENT COMPANY DURING THE TIME PERIOD OF ANY DEFAULT;  \u2022  TRIGGERING OUR OBLIGATION TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER ANY FINANCIAL GUARANTEE, LETTER OF CREDIT OR OTHER CREDIT SUPPORT WE HAVE PROVIDED TO OR ON BEHALF OF SUCH SUBSIDIARY;  \u2022  CAUSING US TO RECORD A LOSS IN THE EVENT THE LENDER FORECLOSES ON THE ASSETS; AND  \u2022  TRIGGERING DEFAULTS IN OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT AT THE PARENT COMPANY.  FOR EXAMPLE, OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY AND OUTSTANDING DEBT SECURITIES AT THE PARENT COMPANY INCLUDE EVENTS OF DEFAULT FOR CERTAIN BANKRUPTCY-RELATED EVENTS INVOLVING MATERIAL SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, OUR REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT AT THE PARENT COMPANY INCLUDES EVENTS OF DEFAULT RELATED TO PAYMENT DEFAULTS AND ACCELERATIONS OF OUTSTANDING DEBT OF MATERIAL SUBSIDIARIES.  40  SOME OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE CURRENTLY IN DEFAULT WITH RESPECT TO ALL OR A PORTION OF THEIR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS. THE TOTAL NON-RECOURSE DEBT CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AMOUNTS TO  $1.3 BILLION  . THE PORTION OF CURRENT DEBT RELATED TO SUCH DEFAULTS WAS  $345 MILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , ALL OF WHICH WAS NON-RECOURSE DEBT RELATED TO TWO SUBSIDIARIES \u2014 AES PUERTO RICO AND AES ILUMINA. SEE NOTE  8  \u2014  DEBT  IN ITEM 1.\u2014  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL DETAIL.  NONE OF THE SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN DEFAULT ARE SUBSIDIARIES THAT MET THE APPLICABLE DEFINITION OF MATERIALITY UNDER THE PARENT COMPANY\u2019S DEBT AGREEMENTS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , IN ORDER FOR SUCH DEFAULTS TO TRIGGER AN EVENT OF DEFAULT OR PERMIT ACCELERATION UNDER THE PARENT COMPANY\u2019S INDEBTEDNESS. HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF ADDITIONAL DISPOSITIONS OF ASSETS, OTHER SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN ASSET CARRYING VALUES OR OTHER MATTERS IN THE FUTURE THAT MAY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE INDIVIDUAL SUBSIDIARY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ONE OR MORE OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES COULD FALL WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF A \u201cMATERIAL SUBSIDIARY\u201d AND THEREBY TRIGGER AN EVENT OF DEFAULT AND POSSIBLE ACCELERATION OF THE INDEBTEDNESS UNDER THE PARENT COMPANY\u2019S OUTSTANDING DEBT SECURITIES. A MATERIAL SUBSIDIARY IS DEFINED IN THE PARENT COMPANY\u2019S SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY AS ANY BUSINESS THAT CONTRIBUTED 20% OR MORE OF THE PARENT COMPANY\u2019S TOTAL CASH DISTRIBUTIONS FROM BUSINESSES FOR THE FOUR MOST RECENTLY ENDED FISCAL QUARTERS. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , NONE OF THE DEFAULTS LISTED ABOVE INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE RESULTS IN OR IS AT RISK OF TRIGGERING A CROSS-DEFAULT UNDER THE RECOURSE DEBT OF THE PARENT COMPANY.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AES ARE PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GAAP, WHICH REQUIRES THE USE OF ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  LEASES  \u2014 UNDER THE ACCOUNTING STANDARD FOR LEASES, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES OPERATING AND FINANCE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS FOR MOST LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS. LEASE LIABILITIES AND THEIR CORRESPONDING RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE EXPECTED LEASE TERM. OUR SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATES ARE USED IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS WHEN THE IMPLICIT RATE IS NOT READILY DETERMINABLE. CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET MAY BE REQUIRED FOR ITEMS SUCH AS PREPAYMENTS, LEASE INCENTIVES OR INITIAL DIRECT COSTS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE NATURE OF OUR LEASES AND OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES EFFECTING LEASES, SEE NOTE  10  \u2014  LEASES  INCLUDED IN ITEM 1.\u2014  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  OF THIS FORM 10-Q.  THE COMPANY\u2019S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1\u2014  GENERAL AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OF OUR  2018  FORM 10-K. THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE DESCRIBED IN ITEM 7.\u2014  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  IN THE  2018  FORM 10-K. AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE IS CONSIDERED CRITICAL IF THE ESTIMATE REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE AN ASSUMPTION ABOUT MATTERS THAT WERE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME THE ESTIMATE WAS MADE, DIFFERENT ESTIMATES REASONABLY COULD HAVE BEEN USED, OR IF CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATE THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES EMPLOYED ARE APPROPRIATE AND RESULTING BALANCES ARE REASONABLE; HOWEVER, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, REQUIRING ADJUSTMENTS TO THESE BALANCES IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE COMPANY HAS REVIEWED AND DETERMINED THAT THESE REMAIN AS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS OF AND FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "AES CORP", "CIK": 874761, "Date": "2019-05-07T00:00:00", "Ticker": "AES", "Name": "Aes Corp", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 4991.0, "Business": "VA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 541163725.0, "key": "20190507AES", "labelr1": -3.327283726557778, "labelr2": 0.8760951188986269, "labelr3": 0.8064516129032195, "labelr4": -0.8615384615384649, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.49661320000000003, "prof1": 0.50338674, "return1&2": 0.9751966122202058, "return1&2&3": 0.9830611010284332, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9745916515426496, "return2": 1.0087609511889863, "return1": 0.9667271627344224, "return3": 1.0080645161290325, "return4": 0.9913846153846152, "1_day_return": -3.3272837265577726, "cumulative_return1": 0.5401715335974121, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.8583640214838284, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.1344336359046101, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.16356080753360094, "indexx": 669, "cumreturn1b": 1.0859085162732156, "cumreturndow": 0.984844681860806, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9824892892714224}, {"Unnamed: 0": 755, "level_0": 773, "index": 9920, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  GENERAL  MGE ENERGY IS AN INVESTOR-OWNED PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY OPERATING THROUGH SUBSIDIARIES IN FIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  \u00b7  REGULATED ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS, CONDUCTED THROUGH MGE,  \u00b7  REGULATED GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS, CONDUCTED THROUGH MGE,  \u00b7  NONREGULATED ENERGY OPERATIONS, CONDUCTED THROUGH MGE POWER AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES,  \u00b7  TRANSMISSION INVESTMENTS, REPRESENTING OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN ATC AND ATC HOLDCO, AND  \u00b7  ALL OTHER, WHICH INCLUDES CORPORATE OPERATIONS AND SERVICES.  OUR PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARY IS MGE, WHICH GENERATES AND DISTRIBUTES ELECTRIC ENERGY, DISTRIBUTES NATURAL GAS, AND REPRESENTS A MAJORITY PORTION OF OUR ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, AND EXPENSES. MGE GENERATES AND DISTRIBUTES ELECTRICITY TO APPROXIMATELY 153,000 CUSTOMERS IN DANE COUNTY, WISCONSIN, INCLUDING THE CITY OF MADISON, AND PURCHASES AND DISTRIBUTES NATURAL GAS TO APPROXIMATELY 161,000 CUSTOMERS IN THE WISCONSIN COUNTIES OF COLUMBIA, CRAWFORD, DANE, IOWA, JUNEAU, MONROE, AND VERNON.  OUR NONREGULATED ENERGY OPERATIONS OWN INTERESTS IN ELECTRIC GENERATING CAPACITY THAT IS LEASED TO MGE. THE OWNERSHIP/LEASING STRUCTURE WAS ADOPTED UNDER APPLICABLE STATE REGULATORY GUIDELINES FOR MGE'S PARTICIPATION IN THESE GENERATION FACILITIES, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF A STABLE RETURN ON THE EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE NEW GENERATION FACILITIES OVER THE TERM OF THE RELATED LEASES. THE NONREGULATED ENERGY OPERATIONS INCLUDE AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN TWO COAL-FIRED GENERATING UNITS IN OAK CREEK, WISCONSIN AND A PARTIAL OWNERSHIP OF A COGENERATION PROJECT ON THE UW-MADISON CAMPUS. A THIRD PARTY OPERATES THE UNITS IN OAK CREEK, AND MGE OPERATES THE COGENERATION PROJECT. DUE TO THE NATURE OF MGE'S PARTICIPATION IN THESE FACILITIES, THE RESULTS OF MGE ENERGY'S NONREGULATED OPERATIONS ARE ALSO CONSOLIDATED INTO MGE'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UNDER APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  OUR PRIMARY FOCUS TODAY AND FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE IS OUR CORE UTILITY CUSTOMERS AT MGE AS WELL AS CREATING LONG-TERM VALUE FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS. MGE CONTINUES TO FACE THE CHALLENGE OF PROVIDING ITS CUSTOMERS WITH RELIABLE POWER AT COMPETITIVE PRICES. MGE MEETS THIS CHALLENGE BY INVESTING IN MORE EFFICIENT GENERATION PROJECTS, INCLUDING RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES. MGE CONTINUES TO EXAMINE AND PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE THE PROPORTION THAT COAL GENERATION REPRESENTS IN ITS GENERATION MIX, INCLUDING THE ANNOUNCED REDUCTION IN ITS OWNERSHIP OF COLUMBIA AND ITS GROWING OWNERSHIP OF RENEWABLE GENERATION SOURCES. MGE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON GROWING EARNINGS WHILE CONTROLLING OPERATING AND FUEL COSTS. MGE MAINTAINS SAFE AND EFFICIENT OPERATIONS IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING CUSTOMER VALUE. WE BELIEVE IT IS CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN A STRONG CREDIT STANDING CONSISTENT WITH FINANCIAL STRENGTH IN MGE AS WELL AS THE PARENT COMPANY IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS.  WE EARN OUR REVENUE AND GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATIONS BY PROVIDING ELECTRIC AND NATURAL GAS UTILITY SERVICES, INCLUDING ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION AND ELECTRIC POWER AND GAS DISTRIBUTION. THE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS FROM THE UTILITY BUSINESS ARE SENSITIVE TO VARIOUS EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u00b7  WEATHER, AND ITS IMPACT ON CUSTOMER SALES,  \u00b7  ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CURRENT BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND EMPLOYMENT AND THEIR IMPACT ON CUSTOMER DEMAND,  \u00b7  REGULATION AND REGULATORY ISSUES, AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE TIMING AND RECOVERY OF COSTS,  \u00b7  ENERGY COMMODITY PRICES, INCLUDING NATURAL GAS PRICES,  \u00b7  EQUITY PRICE RISK PERTAINING TO PENSION RELATED ASSETS,  \u00b7  CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATES AND OUR DEBT CREDIT RATING,  \u00b7  ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING ADOPTED AND PENDING ENVIRONMENTAL RULE CHANGES, AND  \u00b7  OTHER FACTORS LISTED IN \"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\" IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  31  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, MGE ENERGY'S EARNINGS WERE $24.0 MILLION OR $0.69 PER SHARE COMPARED TO $20.0 MILLION OR $0.58 PER SHARE FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. MGE'S EARNINGS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WERE $16.6 MILLION COMPARED TO $12.5 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  MGE ENERGY'S NET INCOME WAS DERIVED FROM OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  (IN MILLIONS)  MARCH 31,  BUSINESS SEGMENT.  2019  2018  ELECTRIC UTILITY  $9.3  $6.1  GAS UTILITY  7.8  7.0  NONREGULATED ENERGY  5.0  5.1  TRANSMISSION INVESTMENTS  1.6  1.7  ALL OTHER  0.3  0.1  NET INCOME  $24.0  $20.0  OUR NET INCOME DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE EFFECTS OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.  ELECTRIC UTILITY  EARNINGS FROM INVESTMENTS INCREASED IN 2019 AS A RESULT OF THE COMPLETION OF THE SARATOGA WIND FARM.  GAS UTILITY  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, GAS OPERATING INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN GAS RETAIL SALES REFLECTING HIGHER CUSTOMER DEMAND RESULTING FROM COLDER WEATHER EXPERIENCED DURING THE QUARTER COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND AN INCREASE IN RETAIL CUSTOMERS. HEATING DEGREE DAYS (A MEASURE FOR DETERMINING THE IMPACT OF WEATHER DURING THE HEATING SEASON) INCREASED BY 7.3% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019, THE FOLLOWING EVENTS OCCURRED.  2019/2020 RATE SETTLEMENT: IN DECEMBER 2018, THE PSCW APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN MGE AND INTERVENING PARTIES IN THE RATE CASE. THE SETTLEMENT DECREASES ELECTRIC RATES BY 2.24% OR $9.2 MILLION IN 2019. MGE WILL MAINTAIN THIS RATE LEVEL FOR 2020, WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT MGE WILL FILE A 2020 FUEL COST PLAN IN 2019 AND MGE'S ELECTRIC RATES WILL BE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY. THE DECREASE REFLECTS THE ONGOING TAX IMPACTS OF THE TAX ACT AND THE ADDITION OF LOWER-COST RENEWABLE GENERATION CAPACITY. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT INCREASES GAS RATES BY 1.06% OR $1.7 MILLION IN 2019 AND 1.46% OR $2.4 MILLION IN 2020. THE INCREASE COVERS INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS. IT ALSO REFLECTS THE IMPACTS OF THE TAX ACT.  PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS: COSTS FOR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ARE AFFECTED BY ACTUAL INVESTMENT RETURNS ON THE ASSETS HELD FOR THOSE BENEFITS AND BY THE DISCOUNT RATE, WHICH IS SENSITIVE TO INTEREST RATES, USED TO CALCULATE THOSE BENEFITS. VOLATILITY IN INTEREST RATES AND INVESTMENT RETURNS COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. THESE CHANGES MAY AFFECT BENEFIT COSTS IN FUTURE YEARS. AS A RESULT OF LOWER INVESTMENT RETURNS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS INCREASED IN 2019. IN DECEMBER 2018, MGE FILED A DEFERRAL REQUEST WITH THE PSCW TO DEFER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ESTIMATED PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT COSTS INCLUDED IN THE 2019 AND 2020 RATE SETTLEMENT AND ACTUAL EXPENSE INCURRED. MGE EXPECTS ACTUAL EXPENSE WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $5.9 MILLION HIGHER IN 2019 THAN ESTIMATED COSTS INCLUDED IN THE RATE SETTLEMENT. THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT COSTS FOR 2020 ARE CURRENTLY UNKNOWN. MGE HAS NOT DEFERRED ANY COST AND WILL WAIT UNTIL A DECISION HAS BEEN REACHED BY THE PSCW, WHICH IS EXPECTED IN 2019.  SARATOGA WIND FARM: IN DECEMBER 2017, THE PSCW AUTHORIZED CONSTRUCTION OF A 66 MW WIND FARM, CONSISTING OF 33 TURBINES, LOCATED NEAR SARATOGA, IOWA. CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECT WAS COMPLETED IN FEBRUARY 2019 FOR APPROXIMATELY $112 MILLION. MGE RECEIVED SPECIFIC APPROVAL TO RECOVER 100% AFUDC ON THE PROJECT. AFTER TAX, MGE HAS RECOGNIZED $0.8 MILLION IN AFUDC EQUITY RELATED TO THIS PROJECT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  32  COLUMBIA: MGE AND WPL HAVE NEGOTIATED AN AMENDMENT TO THE EXISTING COLUMBIA JOINT OPERATING AGREEMENT, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017, UNDER WHICH MGE HAS REDUCED ITS OBLIGATION TO PAY CERTAIN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (OTHER THAN SCR-RELATED EXPENDITURES) AT COLUMBIA IN EXCHANGE FOR A PROPORTIONAL REDUCTION IN MGE'S OWNERSHIP IN COLUMBIA. ON JANUARY 1 OF EACH YEAR FROM 2017 THROUGH 2019 AND THEN ON JUNE 1, 2020, THE OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE IS ADJUSTED THROUGH A PARTIAL SALE BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOREGONE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, MGE CLASSIFIED $3.1 MILLION OF COLUMBIA ASSETS AS HELD-FOR-SALE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. IN JANUARY 2019, MGE REDUCED ITS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN COLUMBIA FROM 19.4% TO 19.1% AS A RESULT OF THE PARTIAL SALE OF PLANT ASSETS TO WPL.  IN THE NEAR TERM, SEVERAL ITEMS MAY AFFECT US, INCLUDING.  TAX REFORM: PURSUANT TO THE TAX ACT, DEFERRED INCOME TAX BALANCES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WERE REMEASURED TO REFLECT THE DECREASE IN CORPORATE TAX RATE. A $130.5 MILLION REGULATORY LIABILITY WAS RECORDED GIVEN THAT CHANGES IN INCOME TAXES ARE GENERALLY PASSED THROUGH IN CUSTOMER RATES FOR THE REGULATED UTILITY. THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF THE CASH IMPACTS WILL DEPEND ON THE PERIOD OVER WHICH CERTAIN INCOME TAX BENEFITS ARE PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS, WHICH WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE PSCW. A PORTION OF THE REGULATORY LIABILITY WILL BE RETURNED TO CUSTOMERS USING A NORMALIZATION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.  ATC RETURN ON EQUITY: SEVERAL PARTIES HAVE FILED COMPLAINTS WITH THE FERC SEEKING TO REDUCE THE ROE USED BY MISO TRANSMISSION OWNERS, INCLUDING ATC. ANY CHANGE TO ATC'S ROE COULD RESULT IN LOWER EQUITY EARNINGS AND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM ATC IN THE FUTURE. WE DERIVED APPROXIMATELY 6.4% AND 8.9% OF OUR NET INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN ATC. SEE \"OTHER MATTERS\" BELOW FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING ATC.  ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES: THERE ARE PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE RULES AND INITIATIVES INVOLVING MATTERS RELATED TO AIR EMISSIONS, WATER EFFLUENT, HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, AND GREENHOUSE GASES, ALL OF WHICH AFFECT GENERATION PLANT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING COSTS AS WELL AS FUTURE OPERATIONAL PLANNING. AT PRESENT, IT IS UNCLEAR HOW THE CHANGES IN THE PRESIDENTIAL AND EPA ADMINISTRATIONS MAY AFFECT EXISTING, PENDING OR NEW LEGISLATIVE OR RULEMAKING PROPOSALS OR REGULATORY INITIATIVES. SUCH LEGISLATION AND RULEMAKING COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE COSTS OF OWNING AND OPERATING FOSSIL-FUELED GENERATING PLANTS, SUCH AS COLUMBIA AND THE ELM ROAD UNITS, FROM WHICH WE DERIVE APPROXIMATELY 43% OF OUR ELECTRIC GENERATING CAPACITY AS OF MARCH 31, 2019. WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEEK AND RECEIVE RECOVERY OF ANY SUCH COSTS IN RATES; HOWEVER, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF SUCH COSTS DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE TIMING AND FORM OF THE LEGISLATION AND RULES, AND THE SCOPE AND TIME OF THE RECOVERY OF COSTS IN RATES, WHICH MAY LAG THE INCURRENCE OF THOSE COSTS.  EPA'S CLEAN POWER PLAN: IN OCTOBER 2015, THE EPA FINALIZED ITS CLEAN POWER PLAN (CPP) RULE WITH AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF DECEMBER 2015, SETTING GUIDELINES AND APPROVAL CRITERIA FOR STATES TO USE IN DEVELOPING PLANS TO CONTROL GHG EMISSIONS FROM EXISTING FOSSIL FUEL-FIRED ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS AND SYSTEMS. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RULE IS CURRENTLY STAYED BY ORDER TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, HOWEVER, IF IMPLEMENTED, THE CPP WOULD HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON EXISTING COAL AND NATURAL GAS FIRED GENERATING UNITS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE CHANGES IN DISPATCH AND ADDITIONAL OPERATING COSTS. THE RULE IS THE SUBJECT OF PENDING LEGAL CHALLENGES. IN AUGUST 2018, THE EPA PROPOSED THE AFFORDABLE CLEAN ENERGY (ACE) RULE WHICH WOULD REPLACE THE CPP, IF SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED. THE PROPOSED ACE RULE AS IT IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT BLOUNT, COLUMBIA, AND THE ELM ROAD UNITS. GIVEN THE PENDING CPP LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND THE PROPOSED ACE RULE, THE NATURE AND TIMING OF ANY FINAL REQUIREMENTS TO CONTROL GHG EMISSIONS FROM EXISTING FOSSIL FUEL-FIRED EGUS IS SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY. MGE IS UNABLE TO DETERMINE WITH ANY CERTAINTY THE IMPACT OF THE CPP AND PROPOSED ACE RULE ON OUR OPERATIONS. IF AN ACE RULE IS IMPLEMENTED SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE FORM OF THE CPP RULE, IT IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON MGE. MGE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS WITH THE PROPOSED ACE RULE, THE CPP RULE, AND RELATED LITIGATION.  COLUMBIA: MGE WILL REDUCE FURTHER ITS OBLIGATION TO PAY CERTAIN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (OTHER THAN SCR-RELATED EXPENDITURES) AT COLUMBIA IN EXCHANGE FOR A PROPORTIONAL REDUCTION IN MGE'S OWNERSHIP IN COLUMBIA. BY JUNE 2020, MGE'S OWNERSHIP IN COLUMBIA IS FORECASTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 19%, A DECREASE OF 3% FROM THE 22% OWNERSHIP INTEREST HELD BY MGE ON JANUARY 1, 2016.  33  FUTURE GENERATION - RIVERSIDE: IN 2016, MGE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH WPL UNDER WHICH MGE MAY ACQUIRE UP TO 50 MW OF CAPACITY IN A GAS-FIRED GENERATING PLANT TO BE CONSTRUCTED BY WPL AT ITS RIVERSIDE ENERGY CENTER IN BELOIT, WISCONSIN, DURING THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD FOLLOWING THE IN-SERVICE DATE OF THE PLANT. THE PLANT IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY EARLY 2020. MGE HAS NOT YET DETERMINED WHETHER IT WILL EXERCISE ITS OPTION IN THE RIVERSIDE PLANT. A DETERMINATION WILL BE MADE BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS IN FUTURE YEARS.  FUTURE GENERATION - UTILITY SOLAR: IN APRIL 2019, THE PSCW APPROVED THE JOINT APPLICATION OF MGE AND WISCONSIN PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATION TO ACQUIRE 300 MW OF SOLAR GENERATING CAPACITY FROM TWO LARGE SOLAR PROJECTS IN WISCONSIN. MGE'S COMBINED OWNERSHIP SHARE OF THE TWO PROJECTS IS EXPECTED TO BE 100 MW. CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECTS IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN 2019 AND EXPECTED TO BE ONLINE BY THE END OF 2020. MGE'S SHARE OF THE TOTAL COST IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $130 MILLION.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS BASED ON THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AS DISCUSSED IN FOOTNOTE 15 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDE FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND ELECTRIC AND GAS MARGINS, BOTH WHICH ARE NON-GAAP MEASURES. ELECTRIC MARGIN (ELECTRIC REVENUES LESS FUEL FOR ELECTRIC GENERATION AND PURCHASE POWER COSTS) AND GAS MARGIN (GAS REVENUES LESS COST OF GAS SOLD) ARE NON-GAAP MEASURES BECAUSE THEY EXCLUDE NONREGULATED OPERATING REVENUES USED IN THE CALCULATION OF THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE, OPERATING INCOME; OTHER OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER GENERAL TAXES EXPENSE. THUS, ELECTRIC AND GAS MARGIN ARE NOT MEASURES DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ELECTRIC AND GAS MARGINS PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL BASIS FOR EVALUATING AND MANAGING UTILITY OPERATIONS SINCE FUEL FOR ELECTRIC GENERATION, PURCHASE POWER COSTS, AND COST OF GAS SOLD ARE PASSED THROUGH WITHOUT MARK-UP TO CUSTOMERS IN CURRENT RATES. AS A RESULT, MANAGEMENT USES ELECTRIC AND GAS MARGINS INTERNALLY WHEN ASSESSING THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR SEGMENTS. THE PRESENTATION OF UTILITY ELECTRIC AND GAS MARGINS HEREIN IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION FOR INVESTORS REGARDING OPERATING PERFORMANCE. THESE ELECTRIC AND GAS MARGINS MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO HOW OTHER ENTITIES CALCULATE UTILITY ELECTRIC AND GAS MARGIN OR SIMILAR MEASURES. FURTHERMORE, THESE MEASURES ARE NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE OPERATING INCOME AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AS AN INDICATOR OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES A CALCULATION OF ELECTRIC AND GAS MARGINS (NON-GAAP), ALONG WITH A RECONCILIATION TO THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE, OPERATING INCOME.

MGE RECOGNIZED REVENUE FOR ELECTRIC PLANT OPERATING COSTS SUBJECT TO REFUND FROM PREVIOUS YEARS OF $0.3 MILLION IN 2019. IN 2018, MGE RECORDED A $0.9 MILLION REDUCTION IN RETAIL ELECTRIC REVENUES PRIMARILY RELATED TO LOWER LEASED GENERATION COSTS DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN TAX RATE.  \u00b7  FUEL COSTS.  FUEL COSTS DECREASED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A REDUCTION IN PURCHASED POWER. THE PURCHASE OF THE FORWARD WIND ENERGY CENTER IN APRIL 2018 REPLACED AN EXISTING PURCHASE POWER AGREEMENT THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AS PURCHASED POWER EXPENSE IN FUEL COSTS. THE COMMERCIAL OPERATION OF THE SARATOGA WIND FARM IN FEBRUARY 2019 FURTHER DECREASED THE NEED FOR PURCHASED POWER CONTRIBUTING TO THE REDUCTION IN FUEL COSTS IN THE CURRENT QUARTER.  \u00b7  VOLUME.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THERE WAS A 2.7% INCREASE IN RESIDENTIAL ELECTRIC SALES VOLUMES COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY INCREASED CUSTOMER DEMAND.  \u00b7  RATE CHANGES.

FURTHER DISCUSSION OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS IS INCLUDED IN MGE ENERGY'S AND MGE'S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND FOOTNOTE 9.A. OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT.  OTHER MATTERS  ATC  IN 2013, SEVERAL PARTIES FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE FERC SEEKING TO REDUCE THE BASE RETURN ON EQUITY (ROE) USED BY MISO TRANSMISSION OWNERS, INCLUDING ATC, \"DUE TO CHANGES IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS.\" THE COMPLAINT ALLEGED THAT THE MISO ROE SHOULD NOT EXCEED 9.15%, THE EQUITY COMPONENTS OF HYPOTHETICAL CAPITAL STRUCTURES SHOULD BE RESTRICTED TO 50%, AND THE RELEVANT INCENTIVE ROE ADDERS SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED. AT THE TIME, MISO'S BASE ROE WAS 12.38% AND ATC'S BASE ROE WAS 12.2%. ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2016, FERC ISSUED AN ORDER ON THE 2013 COMPLAINT, FOR THE PERIOD NOVEMBER 2013 THROUGH FEBRUARY 2015, REDUCING THE BASE ROE TO 10.32%. THIS BASE ROE ALSO BECAME EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 28, 2016, AND WILL APPLY TO FUTURE PERIODS UNTIL FERC RULES IN THE SECOND COMPLAINT DESCRIBED BELOW, AT WHICH TIME THE BASE ROE ORDERED BY FERC IN THE SECOND COMPLAINT WILL PROSPECTIVELY BECOME THE AUTHORIZED BASE ROE.  IN FEBRUARY 2015, A SECOND COMPLAINT WAS FILED FOR THE PERIOD FEBRUARY 2015 THROUGH MAY 2015 WITH THE FERC REQUESTING A REDUCTION IN THE BASE ROE USED BY MISO TRANSMISSION OWNERS, INCLUDING ATC, TO 8.67%, WITH A REFUND EFFECTIVE DATE RETROACTIVE TO THE FILING DATE OF THE COMPLAINT. IN JUNE 2016, AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ISSUED AN INITIAL DECISION FOR THE SECOND COMPLAINT THAT WOULD REDUCE THE TRANSMISSION OWNER'S BASE ROE TO 9.7%. THE INITIAL DECISION WILL BE REVIEWED BY FERC. IT IS ANTICIPATED FERC WILL ISSUE AN ORDER ON THIS ISSUE IN 2019.  IN JANUARY 2015, FERC ACCEPTED THE TRANSMISSION OWNER'S REQUEST FOR A 50 BASIS-POINT INCENTIVE ROE ADDER FOR PARTICIPATING IN MISO. THE ADDER BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 6, 2015.

WE EXPECT FULL-YEAR  2019  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $3.6 BILLION  . WE EXPECT TO FUND  2019  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES PRIMARILY WITH INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS AND ADDITIONAL DEBT FINANCING.  FINANCING AND OTHER FUNDING TRANSACTIONS  WE UTILIZE EXTERNAL CAPITAL PRIMARILY TO SUPPORT WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND GROWTH IN OUR ASSET-BASED PRODUCT LINES. THE VARIETY OF DEBT FINANCING ALTERNATIVES TYPICALLY AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR CAPITAL NEEDS INCLUDE COMMERCIAL PAPER, LONG-TERM AND MEDIUM-TERM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DEBT, ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, BANK TERM LOANS, LEASING ARRANGEMENTS AND BANK CREDIT FACILITIES. OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF FINANCING ARE ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND MEDIUM-TERM NOTES.  OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS UNSECURED DEBT IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS IS IMPACTED BY BOTH OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS. THESE RATINGS ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO INVESTORS IN DETERMINING THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH PARTICULAR RYDER SECURITIES BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION OBTAINED BY THE RATING AGENCIES FROM US OR FROM OTHER SOURCES. LOWER RATINGS GENERALLY RESULT IN HIGHER BORROWING COSTS, AS WELL AS REDUCED ACCESS TO UNSECURED CAPITAL MARKETS. A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE OF OUR SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS WOULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LIKELY REQUIRE US TO RELY ON ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES. A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE WOULD NOT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO BORROW AMOUNTS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DESCRIBED BELOW, ASSUMING ONGOING COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY.  OUR DEBT RATINGS AND RATING OUTLOOKS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WERE AS FOLLOWS.

IF WE DECIDE TO REPATRIATE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD OUTSIDE THE U.S., WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES. HOWEVER, OUR INTENT IS TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST THESE FOREIGN AMOUNTS OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND OUR CURRENT PLANS DO NOT DEMONSTRATE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THESE FOREIGN AMOUNTS TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS, TOGETHER WITH OUR ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC UNSECURED BOND MARKET, COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AND OTHER AVAILABLE DEBT FINANCING, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING NEEDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT UNANTICIPATED VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION IN THE PUBLIC UNSECURED DEBT MARKET OR THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET WOULD NOT IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THESE MARKETS ON TERMS COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TO US OR AT ALL. IF WE CEASE TO HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC BONDS, COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER SOURCES OF UNSECURED BORROWINGS, WE  51  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)  WOULD MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS BY DRAWING UPON CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED LENDING AGREEMENTS AND/OR BY SEEKING OTHER FUNDING SOURCES.

WE UTILIZE BOTH FIXED-RATE AND VARIABLE-RATE DEBT TO ACHIEVE THIS ALIGNMENT AND GENERALLY TARGET A MIX OF 20% - 40% VARIABLE-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING. THE VARIABLE-RATE PORTION OF OUR TOTAL DEBT (INCLUDING NOTIONAL VALUE OF SWAP AGREEMENTS) WAS  25%  AND  28%  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)  PENSION INFORMATION  THE FUNDED STATUS OF OUR PENSION PLANS IS DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING RETURNS ON INVESTED ASSETS AND THE LEVEL OF CERTAIN MARKET INTEREST RATES. WE REVIEW PENSION ASSUMPTIONS REGULARLY AND WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, MAKE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLANS, WHICH EXCEED THE AMOUNTS REQUIRED BY STATUTE. IN  2019  , THE EXPECTED TOTAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLANS ARE APPROXIMATELY $34 MILLION  . DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , WE CONTRIBUTED  $8 MILLION  TO OUR PENSION PLANS. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES HELD BY THE PLANS DURING  2019  COULD MATERIALLY CHANGE, POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY, THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PLANS AND AFFECT THE LEVEL OF PENSION EXPENSE AND CONTRIBUTIONS IN  2019  AND BEYOND.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q INCLUDES INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION BUT NOT REQUIRED BY GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) TO BE PRESENTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THIS INFORMATION ARE CONSIDERED \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d AS DEFINED BY SEC RULES. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, BUT NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO, OTHER MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR LIQUIDITY PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  ALSO, OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. WE PROVIDE A RECONCILIATION OF EACH OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE IN THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SECTION. WE ALSO PROVIDE THE REASONS WHY MANAGEMENT BELIEVES EACH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN THIS SECTION.  SPECIFICALLY, WE REFER TO THE FOLLOWING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THIS FORM 10-Q.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE  COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE  OPERATING REVENUE MEASURES  .  OPERATING REVENUE  TOTAL REVENUE  FMS OPERATING REVENUE  FMS TOTAL REVENUE  DTS OPERATING REVENUE  DTS TOTAL REVENUE  SCS OPERATING REVENUE  SCS TOTAL REVENUE  FMS EBT AS A % OF FMS OPERATING REVENUE  FMS EBT AS A % OF FMS TOTAL REVENUE  DTS EBT AS A % OF DTS OPERATING REVENUE  DTS EBT AS A % OF DTS TOTAL REVENUE  SCS EBT AS A % OF SCS OPERATING REVENUE  SCS EBT AS A % OF SCS TOTAL REVENUE  COMPARABLE EARNINGS MEASURES  .

TOTAL CASH GENERATED AND FREE CASH FLOW  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  54  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)  SET FORTH IN THE TABLE BELOW IS AN OVERVIEW OF EACH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND WHY MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE PRESENTATION OF EACH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS. SEE RECONCILIATIONS FOR EACH OF THESE MEASURES FOLLOWING THIS TABLE.  OPERATING REVENUE MEASURES  .  OPERATING REVENUE  FMS OPERATING REVENUE  DTS OPERATING REVENUE  SCS OPERATING REVENUE  FMS EBT AS A % OF FMS OPERATING REVENUE  DTS EBT AS A % OF DTS OPERATING REVENUE  SCS EBT AS A % OF SCS OPERATING REVENUE  OPERATING REVENUE IS DEFINED AS TOTAL REVENUE FOR RYDER SYSTEM, INC. OR EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT (FMS, DTS AND SCS), RESPECTIVELY, EXCLUDING ANY (1) FUEL AND (2) SUBCONTRACTED TRANSPORTATION. WE BELIEVE OPERATING REVENUE PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS AS WE USE IT TO EVALUATE THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR CORE BUSINESSES AND AS A MEASURE OF SALES ACTIVITY AT THE CONSOLIDATED LEVEL FOR RYDER SYSTEM, INC., AS WELL AS FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  WE ALSO USE SEGMENT EBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUE FOR EACH BUSINESS SEGMENT FOR THE SAME REASON. NOTE: FMS EBT, DTS EBT AND SCS EBT, OUR PRIMARY MEASURES OF SEGMENT PERFORMANCE, ARE NOT NON-GAAP MEASURES.  FUEL  :  WE EXCLUDE FMS, DTS AND SCS FUEL FROM THE CALCULATION OF OUR OPERATING REVENUE MEASURES, AS FUEL IS AN ANCILLARY SERVICE THAT WE PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH IS IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET FUEL PRICES, AND THE COSTS ARE LARGELY A PASS-THROUGH TO OUR CUSTOMERS, RESULTING IN MINIMAL CHANGES IN OUR PROFITABILITY DURING PERIODS OF STEADY MARKET FUEL PRICES. HOWEVER, PROFITABILITY MAY BE POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY RAPID CHANGES IN MARKET FUEL PRICES DURING A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, AS CUSTOMER PRICING FOR FUEL SERVICES IS ESTABLISHED BASED ON TRAILING MARKET FUEL COSTS.  SUBCONTRACTED TRANSPORTATION  :  WE ALSO EXCLUDE SUBCONTRACTED TRANSPORTATION FROM THE CALCULATION OF OUR OPERATING REVENUE MEASURES, AS THESE SERVICES ARE ALSO TYPICALLY A PASS-THROUGH TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, FLUCTUATIONS RESULT IN MINIMAL CHANGES TO OUR PROFITABILITY. WHILE OUR DTS AND SCS BUSINESS SEGMENTS SUBCONTRACT CERTAIN TRANSPORTATION SERVICES TO THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS, OUR FMS BUSINESS SEGMENT DOES NOT ENGAGE IN SUBCONTRACTED TRANSPORTATION AND, THEREFORE, THIS ITEM IS NOT APPLICABLE TO FMS.  COMPARABLE EARNINGS MEASURES  .  COMPARABLE EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAX (EBT)  COMPARABLE EARNINGS  COMPARABLE EARNINGS PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE (EPS)  COMPARABLE EBT, COMPARABLE EARNINGS AND COMPARABLE EPS ARE DEFINED, RESPECTIVELY, AS GAAP EBT, EARNINGS AND EPS, ALL FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, EXCLUDING (1) NON-OPERATING PENSION COSTS AND (2) ANY OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS THAT ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THESE COMPARABLE EARNINGS MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS AND ALLOW FOR BETTER YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  NON-OPERATING PENSION COSTS  :  OUR COMPARABLE EARNINGS MEASURES EXCLUDE NON-OPERATING PENSION COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE THE AMORTIZATION OF NET ACTUARIAL LOSS AND PRIOR SERVICE COST, INTEREST COST AND EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS COMPONENTS OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS. WE EXCLUDE NON-OPERATING PENSION COSTS BECAUSE WE CONSIDER THESE TO BE IMPACTED BY FINANCIAL MARKET PERFORMANCE AND OUTSIDE THE OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS.  OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS  : OUR COMPARABLE EARNINGS MEASURES ALSO EXCLUDE OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS THAT ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AS DETAILED IN THE RECONCILIATION TABLE BELOW - PAGE 57. THESE OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND, IN SOME PERIODS, THERE MAY BE NO SUCH SIGNIFICANT ITEMS.  CALCULATION OF COMPARABLE TAX RATE  :  THE COMPARABLE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING THE SAME METHODOLOGY AS THE GAAP PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON THE STATUTORY TAX RATES OF THE JURISDICTIONS TO WHICH THE NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS RELATE.  55  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)  CASH FLOW MEASURES  .  TOTAL CASH GENERATED  FREE CASH FLOW  WE CONSIDER TOTAL CASH GENERATED AND FREE CASH FLOW TO BE IMPORTANT MEASURES OF COMPARATIVE OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AS OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF OPERATING LIQUIDITY ARE CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF REVENUE EARNING EQUIPMENT.  TOTAL CASH GENERATED  :  TOTAL CASH GENERATED IS DEFINED AS THE SUM OF (1) NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, (2) NET CASH PROVIDED BY THE SALE OF REVENUE EARNING EQUIPMENT, (3) NET CASH PROVIDED BY THE SALE OF OPERATING PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND (4) OTHER CASH INFLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES. WE BELIEVE TOTAL CASH GENERATED IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE OF TOTAL CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OUR ONGOING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.  FREE CASH FLOW  : WE REFER TO THE NET AMOUNT OF CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES (EXCLUDING CHANGES IN RESTRICTED CASH AND ACQUISITIONS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AS \u201cFREE CASH FLOW\u201d. WE CALCULATE FREE CASH FLOW AS THE SUM OF (1) NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, (2) NET CASH PROVIDED BY THE SALE OF REVENUE EARNING EQUIPMENT, (3) NET CASH PROVIDED BY THE SALE OF OPERATING PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, (4) OTHER CASH INFLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES, LESS (5) PURCHASES OF PROPERTY AND REVENUE EARNING EQUIPMENT. WE BELIEVE FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH AN IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE ON THE CASH AVAILABLE FOR DEBT SERVICE AND FOR SHAREHOLDERS, AFTER MAKING CAPITAL INVESTMENTS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS. OUR CALCULATION OF FREE CASH FLOW MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE CALCULATION USED BY OTHER COMPANIES AND, THEREFORE, COMPARABILITY MAY BE LIMITED.  56  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (CONTINUED)  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES A RECONCILIATION OF GAAP EARNINGS BEFORE TAXES (EBT), EARNINGS, AND EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE (EPS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS TO COMPARABLE EBT, COMPARABLE EARNINGS AND COMPARABLE EPS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  .

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WE DETERMINED THAT CERTAIN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS SHOULD HAVE BEEN REVERSED IN PRIOR PERIODS WHEN THE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS EXPIRED AND RECORDED A  $3 MILLION  BENEFIT TO OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WE ALSO RECORDED A  $1 MILLION  DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE PRIOR PROVISIONAL ESTIMATE FROM TAX REFORM.

FURTHER ANALYSIS OF OUR SEGMENT OPERATING EXPENSES BY SEGMENT IS PROVIDED BELOW IN \"SEGMENT RESULTS.\"  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS  WE ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM IMPAIRMENT TESTS RELATED TO OUR GOODWILL ANNUALLY, WHICH WE PERFORM AS OF OCTOBER 31, OR SOONER IF AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT OCCURS. DUE TO OUR JANUARY 2019 INTERNAL REORGANIZATION AND THE DECLINE IN OUR STOCK PRICE, WE INCURRED TWO EVENTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 THAT TRIGGERED IMPAIRMENT TESTING. DUE TO THE IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS NOTED AS A RESULT OF THESE TRIGGERING EVENTS, WE EVALUATED OUR GOODWILL FOR THE INTERNAL REORGANIZATION IN JANUARY, AND AGAIN AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AS A RESULT OF THE DECLINE IN OUR STOCK PRICE.  OUR REPORTING UNITS ARE NOT DISCRETE LEGAL ENTITIES WITH DISCRETE FULL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE EMPLOYED IN AND RELATE TO THE OPERATIONS OF MULTIPLE REPORTING UNITS. FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT, WE COMPARE ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY TO ITS CARRYING VALUE OF EQUITY THAT WE ASSIGN TO THE REPORTING UNIT. IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS EQUAL OR GREATER THAN THE CARRYING VALUE, WE CONCLUDE THAT NO IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE, WE RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT EQUAL TO THE EXCESS AMOUNT.  WHEN WE PERFORMED OUR OCTOBER 31, 2018 ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST, WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS BY CONSIDERING BOTH A MARKET APPROACH AND A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD. THE MARKET APPROACH METHOD INCLUDES THE USE OF MULTIPLES OF PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES WHOSE SERVICES ARE COMPARABLE TO OURS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD IS BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF PROJECTED CASH FLOWS AND A TERMINAL VALUE, WHICH REPRESENTS THE EXPECTED NORMALIZED CASH FLOWS OF THE REPORTING UNITS BEYOND THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE DISCRETE PROJECTION PERIOD. BECAUSE OUR LOW STOCK PRICE WAS A TRIGGER FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING, WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR OPERATIONS USING ONLY THE MARKET APPROACH. APPLYING THIS APPROACH, WE UTILIZED COMPANY COMPARISONS AND ANALYST REPORTS WITHIN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY SUPPORTED A RANGE OF FAIR VALUES OF ANNUALIZED REVENUE AND EBITDA MULTIPLES BETWEEN 2.1X AND 4.9X AND 4.9X AND 9.8X, RESPECTIVELY. WE SELECTED A REVENUE AND EBITDA MULTIPLE FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THIS RANGE. WE RECONCILED THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE REPORTING UNITS TO OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION AS OF THE DATE OF EACH OF OUR TRIGGERING EVENTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER AND CONCLUDED THAT THE INDICATED CONTROL PREMIUM OF APPROXIMATELY 4.1% WAS REASONABLE BASED ON RECENT TRANSACTIONS IN THE MARKET PLACE.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENTS PERFORMED WITH RESPECT TO THE REPORTING UNITS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE CONCLUDED THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF OUR REPORTING UNITS WAS LESS THAN OUR CARRYING VALUE OF EQUITY AS OF THE DATE OF EACH OF OUR TRIGGERING EVENTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER. AS A RESULT, WE RECORDED NON-CASH, NON-TAX-DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AGGREGATING TO  $6.5 BILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  OTHER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLES SUMMARIZE OUR TOTAL OTHER EXPENSE, NET AND INCOME TAX EXPENSE.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  INCREASE/(DECREASE)% CHANGE  2019  2018  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)  INTEREST EXPENSE  $(523  )  (535  )  (12  )  (2  )%  OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET  (5  )  21  (26  )  NM  TOTAL OTHER EXPENSE, NET  $(528  )  (514  )  14  3%  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  $138  121  17  14%  _______________________________________________________________________________  NM  PERCENTAGES GREATER THAN 200% AND COMPARISONS BETWEEN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE VALUES OR TO/FROM ZERO VALUES ARE CONSIDERED NOT MEANINGFUL.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED BY  $12 MILLION  , OR  2%  , FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NOT RECORDING, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH THE FAILED SALE LEASEBACK THAT WAS DERECOGNIZED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019 UPON IMPLEMENTATION OF ASC 842 (NEW LEASING STANDARD).  OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET  OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET REFLECTS CERTAIN ITEMS NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR CORE OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OUR SHARE OF INCOME FROM PARTNERSHIPS WE DO NOT CONTROL, INTEREST INCOME, GAINS AND LOSSES FROM NON-OPERATING ASSET DISPOSITIONS, FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES AND COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS. OTHER INCOME, NET DECREASED BY  $26 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME, NET WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT NET PERIODIC EXPENSE, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAIN ON THE EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS (2.3%) AND  51.3%  , RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. WITHOUT THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, THE RATE WOULD BE 28.8%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT LEGISLATION IN DECEMBER 2017 WHICH RESULTED IN A RE-MEASUREMENT OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE NEW FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE.  SEGMENT RESULTS  GENERAL  FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  WE HAD  FIVE  REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.  WE HAVE FOUR SEGMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS CUSTOMERS: INTERNATIONAL AND GLOBAL ACCOUNTS MANAGEMENT, ENTERPRISE, SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESS AND WHOLESALE. FOR OUR FOUR SEGMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS CUSTOMERS, WE CATEGORIZE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND REPORT OUR RELATED REVENUE UNDER THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: IP AND DATA SERVICES, TRANSPORT AND INFRASTRUCTURE, VOICE AND COLLABORATION AND IT AND MANAGED SERVICES. FOR OUR CONSUMER SEGMENT, WE CATEGORIZE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND REPORT OUR RELATED REVENUE UNDER THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: BROADBAND, VOICE, REGULATORY REVENUE AND OTHER.

REVENUE  . OUR MIX OF TOTAL REVENUE FROM THESE SEGMENTS CONTINUE TO MIGRATE FROM TRADITIONAL WIRELINE VOICE SERVICES TO NEWER, LOWER COST MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS OUR SEGMENT CUSTOMERS INCREASINGLY DEMAND INTEGRATED DATA, BROADBAND, HOSTING AND VOICE SERVICES. OUR ETHERNET-BASED SERVICES IN THE WHOLESALE MARKET FACE COMPETITION FROM CABLE COMPANIES AND COMPETITIVE FIBER-BASED TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS. DEMAND FOR OUR PRIVATE LINES SERVICES (INCLUDING BUSINESS DATA SERVICES) CONTINUES TO DECLINE DUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS' OPTIMIZATION OF THEIR NETWORKS, INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION AND TECHNOLOGY MIGRATION TO HIGHER-SPEED SERVICES. WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUED PRICING PRESSURE FOR OUR COLOCATION SERVICES AS OUR COMPETITORS CONTINUE TO EXPAND THEIR ENTERPRISE COLOCATION OPERATIONS. SUSTAINED EXPANSION IN COMPETITIVE CLOUD COMPUTING OFFERINGS BY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND OTHER COMPETITORS HAS LED TO OTHER INCREASED PRICING PRESSURE, A MIGRATION TOWARDS LOWER-PRICED CLOUD-BASED SERVICES AND ENHANCED COMPETITION FOR CONTRACTS, AND WE EXPECT THESE TRENDS TO CONTINUE. CUSTOMERS' DEMAND FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY HAS ALSO INCREASED THE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS OFFERING SERVICES SIMILAR TO OURS. PRICE COMPRESSION FROM EACH OF THESE ABOVE-MENTIONED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE OPERATING MARGINS OF CERTAIN BUSINESS PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS, AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. OUR TRADITIONAL WIRELINE REVENUE HAS BEEN, AND WE EXPECT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ACCESS LINE LOSSES AND PRICE COMPRESSION. IN PARTICULAR, OUR ACCESS, LOCAL SERVICES AND LONG-DISTANCE REVENUE HAVE BEEN, AND WE EXPECT WILL CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CUSTOMER MIGRATION TO MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED SERVICES, A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE USE OF NON-VOICE COMMUNICATIONS, INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION AND PRICE COMPRESSION CAUSED BY VARIOUS FACTORS. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY OF OUR SEGMENT CUSTOMERS ARE SUBSTITUTING CABLE, WIRELESS AND VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL (\"VOIP\") SERVICES FOR TRADITIONAL VOICE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, RESULTING IN CONTINUED ACCESS REVENUE LOSS. ALTHOUGH OUR TRADITIONAL WIRELINE SERVICES GENERALLY FACE FEWER DIRECT COMPETITORS THAN CERTAIN OF OUR NEWER, LOWER COST MORE ADVANCED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, CUSTOMER MIGRATION AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, PRICE COMPRESSION FROM COMPETITIVE PRESSURES HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR TRADITIONAL WIRELINE REVENUE AND THE OPERATING MARGINS OF THESE SERVICES. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE. WE EXPECT BOTH EQUIPMENT SALES AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE AND THE RELATED COSTS WILL FLUCTUATE FROM YEAR TO YEAR AS THIS OFFERING TENDS TO BE MORE SENSITIVE THAN OTHERS TO CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY AND IN SPENDING TRENDS OF OUR FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL BUDGET CUTS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL FUTURE BUDGET CUTS.  EXPENSES.  OUR OPERATING COSTS ALSO IMPACT THE OPERATING MARGINS OF ALL OF OUR ABOVE-MENTIONED SERVICES, BUT TO A LESSER EXTENT THAN PRICE COMPRESSION AND CUSTOMER DISCONNECTS. THESE OPERATING COSTS INCLUDE EMPLOYEE COSTS, SALES COMMISSIONS, SOFTWARE COSTS ON SELECTED SERVICES AND THIRD-PARTY FACILITY COSTS. WE BELIEVE INCREASES IN OPERATING COSTS HAVE GENERALLY HAD A GREATER IMPACT ON THE OPERATING MARGINS OF SOME OF OUR NEWER, MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED SERVICES AS COMPARED TO OUR TRADITIONAL WIRELINE SERVICES, PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE THOSE NEWER SERVICES RELY MORE HEAVILY UPON THE ABOVE-LISTED SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. OPERATING COSTS, SUCH AS THIRD-PARTY FACILITY COSTS, HAVE ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE OPERATING MARGINS OF OUR TRADITIONAL WIRELINE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, BUT TO A LESSER EXTENT THAN CUSTOMER MIGRATION AND PRICE COMPRESSION.  OPERATING EFFICIENCIES  . WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR SEGMENT OPERATING STRUCTURE AND FOCUS. THIS INVOLVES BALANCING OUR WORKFORCE IN RESPONSE TO OUR WORKLOAD REQUIREMENTS, PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND CHANGES IN INDUSTRY, COMPETITIVE, TECHNOLOGICAL AND REGULATORY CONDITIONS, WHILE ACHIEVING OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND IMPROVING OUR PROCESSES THROUGH AUTOMATION. HOWEVER, OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO INCREASE REVENUE WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE THAT WE INCUR HIGHER COSTS IN SOME AREAS. WE ALSO EXPECT OUR SEGMENTS TO BENEFIT INDIRECTLY FROM ANY ENHANCED EFFICIENCIES IN OUR COMPANY-WIDE NETWORK OPERATIONS.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTERNATIONAL AND GLOBAL ACCOUNTS SEGMENT REVENUE  INTERNATIONAL AND GLOBAL ACCOUNTS SEGMENT REVENUE DECREASED BY  $44 MILLION  , OR  5%  , FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2018  .

THE DECREASE IN SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUE WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH IP AND DATA SERVICES, IT AND MANAGED SERVICES AND VOICE AND COLLABORATION. FOREIGN CURRENCY WAS A FACTOR IN THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE AND IP AND DATA SERVICES DECLINED MOSTLY DUE TO REDUCED RATES AND LOWER TRAFFIC; IT AND MANAGED SERVICES DECLINED DUE TO A LARGE CONTRACT THAT WAS RENEGOTIATED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, AND VOICE DECLINES ARE IN LINE WITH BROADER MARKET TRENDS AS CUSTOMERS MOVE AWAY FROM TIME-DIVISION MULTIPLEXING (\u201cTDM\u201d).

THE DECREASE IN OUR TOTAL OPERATING REVENUE WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER TRANSPORT AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND VOICE AND COLLABORATION REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED IP AND DATA SERVICES REVENUE. TRANSPORT AND INFRASTRUCTURE DECLINES ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SEASONAL DECREASES IN EQUIPMENT AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE, COUPLED WITH THE IMPACT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN. VOICE AND COLLABORATION DECLINES ARE DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF CUSTOMER CHURN OF LEGACY VOICE TDM PRODUCTS AND LOWER RATES ON CUSTOMERS TRANSITIONING TO VOIP. INCREASES IN IP AND DATA SERVICES REVENUE OFFSET SOME OF THESE DECLINES, DRIVEN MAINLY BY CUSTOMERS MIGRATING OFF TRADITIONAL WIRELINE SERVICES AND ONTO MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED PRODUCTS.

THE INCREASE IN OUR SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESS SEGMENT EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER EXTERNAL COMMISSIONS PAID TO PARTNERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION DUE TO LOWER HEADCOUNT.  SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESS SEGMENT ADJUSTED EBITDA  SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESS SEGMENT ADJUSTED EBITDA DECREASED BY  $34 MILLION  , OR  7%  , FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .

THE DECREASE IN SEGMENT OPERATING REVENUE WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSPORT AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND VOICE AND COLLABORATION SERVICES. TRANSPORT DECLINES ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CUSTOMER CHURN AND NETWORK CONSOLIDATION AND GROOMING.  VOICE PRODUCT DECLINES ARE DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF MARKET RATE COMPRESSION AND CUSTOMER VOLUME LOSSES RESULTING FROM INSOURCING AND INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION.  WHOLESALE SEGMENT EXPENSES  WHOLESALE SEGMENT EXPENSES DECREASED BY  $39 MILLION  , OR  20%  , FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DIRECT COST OF REVENUE DECLINE COMMENSURATE WITH THE REVENUE DECLINE, NETWORK GROOMING, AND OPERATING SYNERGIES.  WHOLESALE SEGMENT ADJUSTED EBITDA  WHOLESALE SEGMENT ADJUSTED EBITDA DECREASED BY  $34 MILLION  , OR  4%  , FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .

THE DECREASE IN OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS DUE PREDOMINANTLY TO ITEMS MENTIONED ABOVE. A COMBINATION OF CHANGING PRODUCT MIX AND REALIZED COST SAVINGS RESULTED IN IMPROVED ADJUSTED EBITDA AS A PERCENT OF REVENUE.  CONSUMER SEGMENT  THE OPERATIONS OF OUR CONSUMER SEGMENT HAVE BEEN, AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE, IMPACTED BY SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT TRENDS, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW.  REVENUE.  IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND ATTRACT ADDITIONAL RESIDENTIAL BROADBAND SUBSCRIBERS, WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUALLY INCREASE OUR BROADBAND NETWORK'S SCOPE AND TRANSMISSION SPEEDS. AS A RESULT, WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR BROADBAND NETWORK, WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE DELIVERY OF HIGHER-SPEED BROADBAND SERVICES TO A GREATER NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. WE COMPETE IN A MATURING BROADBAND MARKET IN WHICH MOST CONSUMERS ALREADY HAVE BROADBAND SERVICES AND GROWTH RATES IN NEW SUBSCRIBERS HAVE SLOWED OR DECLINED. MOREOVER, AS DESCRIBED FURTHER IN ITEM 1A OF PART I OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, CERTAIN COMPETITORS CONTINUE TO PROVIDE BROADBAND SERVICES AT HIGHER AVERAGE TRANSMISSION SPEEDS THAN OURS OR THROUGH ADVANCED  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WIRELESS DATA SERVICE OFFERINGS, BOTH OF WHICH WE BELIEVE HAVE IMPACTED THE COMPETITIVENESS OF CERTAIN OF OUR BROADBAND OFFERINGS IN CERTAIN OF OUR MARKETS. OUR VOICE REVENUE HAS BEEN, AND WE EXPECT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ACCESS LINE LOSSES AND LOWER LONG-DISTANCE VOICE SERVICE VOLUMES. INTENSE COMPETITION AND PRODUCT SUBSTITUTION CONTINUE TO DRIVE OUR ACCESS LINE LOSSES. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY CONSUMERS ARE SUBSTITUTING CABLE AND WIRELESS VOICE SERVICES AND ELECTRONIC MAIL, TEXTING AND SOCIAL NETWORKING NON-VOICE SERVICES FOR TRADITIONAL VOICE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. WE EXPECT OUR VIDEO REVENUE TO CONTINUE TO DECLINE, PARTICULARLY DUE TO OUR DECISION TO DISCONTINUE ACTIVE MARKETING OF OUR FACILITIES-BASED VIDEO SERVICES IN LIGHT OF COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND ESCALATING CONTENT COSTS. THE DEMAND FOR NEW TECHNOLOGY HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS OFFERING SERVICES SIMILAR TO OURS. PRICE COMPRESSION AND NEW TECHNOLOGY FROM OUR COMPETITORS HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE OPERATING MARGINS OF OUR NEWER, MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE EXPECT THAT THESE FACTORS AND TRENDS WILL CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR CONSUMER BUSINESS. CUSTOMER MIGRATION AND PRICE COMPRESSION FROM COMPETITIVE PRESSURES HAVE NOT ONLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR TRADITIONAL WIRELINE SERVICES REVENUE, BUT THEY HAVE ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE OPERATING MARGINS OF THESE SERVICES AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE.  EXPENSES.  OPERATING COSTS ALSO IMPACT THE OPERATING MARGINS OF THESE SERVICES. THESE OPERATING COSTS INCLUDE EMPLOYEE COSTS, MARKETING AND ADVERTISING EXPENSES, SALES COMMISSIONS AND TV CONTENT COSTS. WE BELIEVE INCREASES IN OPERATING COSTS HAVE GENERALLY HAD A GREATER IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING MARGINS OF OUR NEWER, MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS COMPARED TO OUR TRADITIONAL WIRELINE SERVICES, PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE OUR NEWER, MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RELY MORE HEAVILY UPON THE ABOVE-LISTED OPERATING EXPENSES. OPERATING COSTS ALSO TEND TO IMPACT OUR TRADITIONAL WIRELINE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OPERATING MARGINS TO A LESSER EXTENT THAN OUR NEWER, MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS NOTED ABOVE.  OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.  WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR SEGMENT OPERATING STRUCTURE AND FOCUS. THIS INVOLVES BALANCING OUR WORKFORCE IN RESPONSE TO OUR WORKLOAD REQUIREMENTS, PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND CHANGES IN INDUSTRY, COMPETITIVE, TECHNOLOGICAL AND REGULATORY CONDITIONS. FOLLOWING A REVIEW OF OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS\u2019 ORDER PREFERENCES, WE ELECTED TO CLOSE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REMAINING RETAIL STORES, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL ENABLE US TO REDUCE OPERATING COSTS AND TO REDEPLOY CAPITAL TO HIGHER GROWTH INITIATIVES. WE ALSO EXPECT OUR CONSUMER SEGMENT TO BENEFIT INDIRECTLY FROM ANY ENHANCED EFFICIENCIES IN OUR COMPANY-WIDE NETWORK OPERATIONS.  SEGMENT REVENUE  CONSUMER SEGMENT REVENUE DECREASED BY  $128 MILLION  , OR  8%  , FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN OUR CONSUMER SEGMENT REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN OUR VOICE, OTHER AND REGULATORY REVENUE DRIVEN BY CONTINUED CHURN AND ACTIVE DISCONTINUANCE OF VIDEO SERVICES MARKETING, IN ADDITION TO THE DERECOGNITION OF OUR PRIOR FAILED SALES LEASEBACK, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN BROADBAND REVENUE. WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN USAGE OF OUR TRADITIONAL VOICE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES FOR THE REASONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  SEGMENT EXPENSES  CONSUMER SEGMENT EXPENSES DECREASED BY  $97 MILLION  , OR  33%  , FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN OUR CONSUMER SEGMENT EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN HEADCOUNT COSTS, DECREASES IN MARKETING EXPENSES AND LOWER TV CONTENT COSTS.  SEGMENT ADJUSTED EBITDA  CONSUMER SEGMENT ADJUSTED EBITDA DECREASED BY  $31 MILLION  , OR  2%  , FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . ADJUSTED EBITDA AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE WAS  86%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  81%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN OUR CONSUMER SEGMENT ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS DUE PREDOMINANTLY TO ITEMS MENTIONED ABOVE.  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OVERVIEW OF SOURCES AND USES OF CASH  WE ARE A HOLDING COMPANY THAT IS DEPENDENT ON THE CAPITAL RESOURCES OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO SATISFY OUR PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. SEVERAL OF OUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BORROWED FUNDS EITHER ON A STANDALONE BASIS OR AS PART OF A SEPARATE RESTRICTED GROUP WITH CERTAIN OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES. THE TERMS OF THE INSTRUMENTS GOVERNING THE INDEBTEDNESS OF THESE BORROWERS OR BORROWING GROUPS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THEIR ACCUMULATED CASH. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE LIQUIDITY OF THESE AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES MAY BE LIMITED BY TAX AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS.  OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR SOURCES AND POTENTIAL USES OF CASH, PARTICULARLY IN CONNECTION WITH OUR BUDGETING PROCESSES. GENERALLY SPEAKING, OUR PRINCIPAL FUNDING SOURCE IS CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AND OUR PRINCIPAL CASH REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE OPERATING EXPENSES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCOME TAXES, DEBT REPAYMENTS, DIVIDENDS, PERIODIC PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS PAYMENTS.  BASED ON OUR CURRENT CAPITAL ALLOCATION OBJECTIVES, DURING  2019  WE PROJECT EXPENDING APPROXIMATELY  $3.5 BILLION  TO  $3.8 BILLION  (EXCLUDING INTEGRATION AND TRANSFORMATION CAPITAL) OF CASH FOR CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND APPROXIMATELY  $271 MILLION  OF CASH FOR DIVIDENDS PER QUARTER ON OUR COMMON STOCK (BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER \"DIVIDENDS\"). AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD DEBT MATURITIES OF  $429 MILLION  , SCHEDULED DEBT PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF  $164 MILLION  AND FINANCE LEASE AND OTHER FIXED PAYMENTS OF  $39 MILLION  , EACH DUE DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. EACH OF THE EXPENDITURES IS DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HELD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $441 MILLION  , AND WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  $1.5 BILLION  OF BORROWING CAPACITY AVAILABLE UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  $96 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AT MARCH 31, 2019. WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO REPATRIATE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INTO THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT PAYING OR ACCRUING U.S. TAXES (SUBJECT TO COMPLYING WITH APPLICABLE CURRENCY, REPATRIATION OR SIMILAR LAWS OR LIMITATIONS).  WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR FUTURE SOURCES AND USES OF CASH, AND ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGIES WHEN, AS AND IF DETERMINED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. WE TYPICALLY USE OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AS A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE \"RISK FACTORS\u2014RISKS AFFECTING OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\" IN ITEM 1A OF PART I OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  WE INCUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ON AN ONGOING BASIS IN ORDER TO ENHANCE AND MODERNIZE OUR NETWORKS, COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN OUR MARKETS, EXPAND AND IMPROVE OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS AND COMPLY WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. WE EVALUATE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE PROJECTS BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXPECTED STRATEGIC IMPACTS (SUCH AS FORECASTED IMPACT ON REVENUE GROWTH, PRODUCTIVITY, EXPENSES, SERVICE LEVELS AND CUSTOMER RETENTION) AND OUR EXPECTED RETURN ON INVESTMENT. THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT IS INFLUENCED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, CASH REQUIRED FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS (SUCH AS OUR CAF PHASE II INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDOUT REQUIREMENTS). BASED ON CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES, WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR 2019 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY  $3.5 BILLION  TO  $3.8 BILLION  , INCLUSIVE OF CAF PHASE II RELATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, BUT EXCLUDING INTEGRATION AND TRANSFORMATION CAPITAL.  OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON MAINTAINING THE OPERATING EFFICIENCY OF OUR NETWORK AND SUPPORTING NEW SERVICE DEVELOPMENTS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR CAPITAL SPENDING, SEE \"HISTORICAL INFORMATION\u2014INVESTING ACTIVITIES\" BELOW AND ITEM 1 OF PART I OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  49  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEBT AND OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS  SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ISSUE DEBT INSTRUMENTS FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE TO REFINANCE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR MATURING DEBT, INCLUDING ISSUING QWEST CORPORATION AND LEVEL 3 FINANCING, INC. DEBT INSTRUMENTS TO REFINANCE THEIR MATURING DEBT TO THE EXTENT WE DEEM APPROPRIATE AND FEASIBLE. THE AVAILABILITY, INTEREST RATE AND OTHER TERMS OF ANY NEW BORROWINGS WILL DEPEND ON THE RATINGS ASSIGNED BY CREDIT RATING AGENCIES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. ALSO SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS, WE EXPECT FROM TIME TO TIME TO RETIRE DEBT SECURITIES PRIOR TO THEIR MATURITY.  ON FEBRUARY 14, 2019, STANDARD AND POOR'S REVISED ITS OUTLOOK ON ALL CENTURYLINK, INC. CREDIT RATINGS FROM NEGATIVE TO STABLE. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, THE CREDIT RATINGS FOR THE SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT AND SENIOR SECURED DEBT OF CENTURYLINK, INC. AND LEVEL 3 FINANCING, INC., AS WELL AS THE SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT OF QWEST CORPORATION AND LEVEL 3 PARENT, LLC WERE AS FOLLOWS.  BORROWER  MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC.

ANY FUTURE DOWNGRADES OF THE SENIOR UNSECURED OR SECURED DEBT RATINGS OF US OR OUR SUBSIDIARIES COULD IMPACT OUR ACCESS TO DEBT CAPITAL OR FURTHER RAISE OUR BORROWING COSTS. SEE \"RISK FACTORS\u2014RISKS AFFECTING OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\" IN ITEM 1A OF PART I OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  NET OPERATING LOSSES  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, CENTURYLINK HAD APPROXIMATELY  $7.3 BILLION  OF FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS (\"NOLS\"), WHICH FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES CAN BE USED TO OFFSET FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. THESE NOLS ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO FEDERAL NOLS WE ACQUIRED THROUGH THE LEVEL 3 ACQUISITION ON NOVEMBER 1, 2017, AND ARE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS UNDER SECTION 382 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (\"CODE\") AND RELATED U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A SECTION 382 RIGHTS AGREEMENT DESIGNED TO SAFEGUARD OUR ABILITY TO USE THOSE NOLS. ASSUMING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE USING THESE NOLS IN THE AMOUNTS PROJECTED, WE EXPECT TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR FEDERAL CASH TAXES FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. THE AMOUNTS OF OUR NEAR-TERM FUTURE TAX PAYMENTS WILL DEPEND UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR FUTURE EARNINGS AND TAX CIRCUMSTANCES AND RESULTS OF ANY CORPORATE TAX REFORM.  50  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DIVIDENDS  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO CONTINUE OUR CURRENT PRACTICE OF PAYING QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS IN RESPECT OF OUR COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS' DISCRETION TO MODIFY OR TERMINATE THIS PRACTICE AT ANY TIME AND FOR ANY REASON WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE. OUR CURRENT QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND RATE IS  $0.25  PER SHARE, AS APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A DIVIDEND RATE PER SHARE WHICH ENABLES US TO BALANCE OUR MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES OF MANAGING OUR BUSINESS, PAYING OUR FIXED COMMITMENTS AND RETURNING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. ASSUMING CONTINUED PAYMENT DURING 2019 AT THIS RATE OF  $0.25  PER SHARE, OUR AVERAGE TOTAL DIVIDEND PAID EACH QUARTER WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY  $271 MILLION  BASED ON THE NUMBER OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES AT  MARCH 31, 2019.  REVOLVING FACILITIES AND OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS  TO SUBSTANTIALLY FUND OUR ACQUISITION OF LEVEL 3, ONE OF OUR AFFILIATES ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \"2017 CENTURYLINK CREDIT AGREEMENT\") WHICH PROVIDES FOR  $10.2 BILLION  IN SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES.  THESE FACILITIES INCLUDED A  $2.2 BILLION  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH  $695 MILLION  OUTSTANDING AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND AN  $8.0 BILLION  TERM LOAN FACILITIES WITH  $7.9 BILLION  OUTSTANDING AS OF MARCH 31, 2019. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE (I) NOTE 5\u2014LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS REPORT AND (II) NOTE 5\u2014LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  ON NOVEMBER 1, 2017, WE ALSO AMENDED OUR UNCOMMITTED REVOLVING LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITY TO SECURE THE FACILITY AND TO PERMIT US TO DRAW UP TO  $225 MILLION  OF LETTERS OF CREDIT THEREUNDER. AT MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD  $84 MILLION  OF LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS FACILITY.  ADDITIONALLY, AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT OR OTHER SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY  $30 MILLION  OF WHICH  $24 MILLION  IS COLLATERALIZED BY CASH THAT IS REFLECTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN RESTRICTED CASH AND SECURITIES.  FOR INFORMATION ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS OF OURS AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING FINANCIAL AND OPERATING COVENANTS, SEE NOTE 5\u2014LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS REPORT.  PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS  WE ARE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR EXISTING DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE ACCOUNTING UNFUNDED STATUS OF OUR QUALIFIED AND NON-QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND QUALIFIED POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS WAS  $1.6 BILLION  AND  $3.0 BILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT  OUR  PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS, SEE \"CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES - PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS\" IN ITEM 7 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND SEE NOTE 10\u2014EMPLOYEE BENEFITS TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THE SAME REPORT.  BENEFITS PAID BY OUR QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN ARE PAID THROUGH A TRUST THAT HOLDS ALL OF THE PLAN'S ASSETS. BASED ON CURRENT LAWS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO BE REQUIRED FOR OUR QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN DURING 2019. THE AMOUNT OF REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN IN  2020  AND BEYOND WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, MOST OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING EARNINGS ON PLAN INVESTMENTS, PREVAILING INTEREST RATES, DEMOGRAPHIC EXPERIENCE, CHANGES IN PLAN BENEFITS AND CHANGES IN FUNDING LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WE OCCASIONALLY MAKE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS IN ADDITION TO REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS. HOWEVER, BASED ON CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MAKING A VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION TO THE TRUST FOR OUR QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN IN 2019.  51  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR POST-RETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS PLANS ARE UNFUNDED. SEVERAL TRUSTS HOLD ASSETS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO HELP COVER THE HEALTH CARE COSTS OF CERTAIN RETIREES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, ASSETS IN THE POST-RETIREMENT TRUSTS HAD BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY DEPLETED AND HAD A FAIR VALUE OF ONLY  $18 MILLION  (A PORTION OF WHICH WAS COMPRISED OF INVESTMENTS WITH RESTRICTED LIQUIDITY), WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITED OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE PAYING BENEFITS FROM THE TRUSTS; HOWEVER, WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO PAY CERTAIN BENEFITS THROUGH THE TRUSTS. BENEFITS NOT PAID FROM THE TRUSTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PAID DIRECTLY BY US WITH AVAILABLE CASH. AS DESCRIBED FURTHER IN NOTE 10\u2014EMPLOYEE BENEFITS TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, AGGREGATE BENEFITS PAID BY US UNDER THESE PLANS (NET OF PARTICIPANT CONTRIBUTIONS AND DIRECT SUBSIDY RECEIPTS) WERE  $249 MILLION  ,  $237 MILLION  AND  $129 MILLION  FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THE AMOUNTS PAID FROM THE TRUST WERE  $4 MILLION  ,  $31 MILLION  AND  $145 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR EXPECTED FUTURE BENEFITS PAYMENTS FOR OUR POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS, PLEASE SEE NOTE 10\u2014EMPLOYEE BENEFITS TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  FOR  2019  , OUR ESTIMATED ANNUAL LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN, NET OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, ARE  6.5%  AND  4.0%  FOR THE PENSION PLAN TRUST ASSETS AND POST-RETIREMENT PLANS TRUST ASSETS, RESPECTIVELY, BASED ON THE ASSETS CURRENTLY HELD. HOWEVER, ACTUAL RETURNS COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT.  FUTURE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  FOR INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED FUTURE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, SEE THE MD&A DISCUSSION INCLUDED IN ITEM 7 OF PART II OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  CONNECT AMERICA FUND  AS A RESULT OF ACCEPTING CAF PHASE 2 SUPPORT PAYMENTS, WE MUST MEET CERTAIN SPECIFIED INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDOUT REQUIREMENTS IN 33 STATES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. IN ORDER TO MEET THESE SPECIFIED INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDOUT REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. SEE \"CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\" ABOVE.

HISTORICAL INFORMATION  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  CHANGE  2019  2018  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $1,182  1,667  (485  )  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (906  )  (768  )  (138  )  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (320  )  (949  )  629  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY  $485 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER ACCRUED EXPENSES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME EXCLUDING GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS SUBJECT TO VARIABILITY PERIOD OVER PERIOD AS A RESULT OF THE TIMING OF THE COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES AND PAYMENTS RELATED TO INTEREST EXPENSE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AND BONUSES.  52  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY  $138 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  SUBSTANTIALLY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED  $629 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO NET PROCEEDS RECEIVED ON THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO PAYMENTS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . IN ADDITION, WE DECREASED OUR DIVIDENDS PAID FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN DIVIDENDS REFLECT THE DECREASE OF THE PER SHARE DIVIDEND AMOUNT TO $0.25 FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  FROM THE $0.54 PER SHARE AMOUNT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PAYMENTS ON LONG-TERM DEBT AND LOWER NET PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  SEE NOTE 5\u2014LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT SECURITIES.  OTHER MATTERS  WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES THAT INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. SEE  NOTE 12\u2014COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER ITEMS  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  MARKET RISK  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE WERE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FROM CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ON OUR VARIABLE RATE LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND FLUCTUATIONS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A FAVORABLE MIX OF FIXED AND VARIABLE RATE DEBT IN AN EFFORT TO LIMIT INTEREST COSTS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN RATES.  MANAGEMENT PERIODICALLY REVIEWS OUR EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND PERIODICALLY IMPLEMENTS STRATEGIES TO MANAGE THE EXPOSURE. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE USED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO (I) LOCK-IN OR SWAP OUR EXPOSURE TO CHANGING OR VARIABLE INTEREST RATES FOR FIXED INTEREST RATES OR (II) TO SWAP OBLIGATIONS TO PAY FIXED INTEREST RATES FOR VARIABLE INTEREST RATES. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND THE APPROVAL, REPORTING AND MONITORING OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT ACTIVITIES.  ON FEBRUARY 15, 2019, WE EXECUTED SWAP TRANSACTIONS THAT REDUCED OUR EXPOSURE TO FLOATING RATES WITH RESPECT TO $2.5 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF FLOATING RATE DEBT. SEE NOTE 10\u2014DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE REGARDING THE COMPANY\u2019S HEDGING ARRANGEMENTS.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  $13.3 BILLION  FLOATING RATE DEBT EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (LIBOR). A HYPOTHETICAL INCREASE OF 100 BASIS POINTS IN LIBOR RELATIVE TO THIS DEBT WOULD DECREASE OUR ANNUAL PRE-TAX EARNINGS BY  $133 MILLION.  WE CONDUCT A PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR, THE CURRENCY IN WHICH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE REPORTED. ACCORDINGLY, OUR OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE VOLATILITY RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. OUR EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN LATIN AMERICAN SUBSIDIARIES USE THE LOCAL CURRENCY AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, AS THE MAJORITY OF THEIR REVENUE AND PURCHASES ARE TRANSACTED IN THEIR LOCAL CURRENCIES. CERTAIN LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES PREVIOUSLY DESIGNATED AS HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMIES USE THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. ALTHOUGH WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE RISKS RELATED TO THE EFFECT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WE WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE GAINS OR LOSSES FROM INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS. CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  53  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CERTAIN SHORTCOMINGS ARE INHERENT IN THE METHOD OF ANALYSIS PRESENTED IN THE COMPUTATION OF EXPOSURES TO MARKET RISKS. ACTUAL VALUES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE DISCLOSED BY US FROM TIME TO TIME IF MARKET CONDITIONS VARY FROM THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE ANALYSES PERFORMED. THESE ANALYSES ONLY INCORPORATE THE RISK EXPOSURES THAT EXISTED AT  MARCH 31, 2019.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD NO SPECIAL PURPOSE OR LIMITED PURPOSE ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING, LIQUIDITY, OR MARKET OR CREDIT RISK SUPPORT AND WE DID NOT ENGAGE IN HEDGING OR OTHER SIMILAR ACTIVITIES THAT EXPOSE US TO ANY SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT (I) REFLECTED ON THE FACE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, (II) DISCLOSED IN NOTE 17\u2014COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , OR IN THE FUTURE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TABLE INCLUDED IN ITEM 7 OF PART II OF THE SAME REPORT, OR (III) DISCUSSED UNDER THE HEADING \"MARKET RISK\" ABOVE.

WE DELIVER A COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES INTO THE GLOBAL MARKET THAT ENABLE CUSTOMERS OF ALL SIZES TO POWER MISSION-CRITICAL WEB, CLOUD AND MOBILE INITIATIVES THAT ULTIMATELY DELIVER HIGH-VALUE TO THEIR BOTTOM LINE. OUR OFFERING CONSISTS OF A ROBUST FRAMEWORK FOR PERSONALIZATION AND SELF-SERVICE, MODULAR APPLICATIONS AND AGILE TOOLSETS THAT CUSTOMERS USE TO CREATE E-COMMERCE, PORTAL SOLUTIONS, ENTERPRISE SOCIAL NETWORKS (ESN), AND COLLABORATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. MOST RECENTLY, WE HAVE ADDED MOBILE AND CLOUD CAPABILITIES TO OUR PLATFORMS TO ENABLE RAPID DEPLOYMENT OF ROBUST, SECURE, AND SCALABLE SOLUTIONS FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.  \ufeff  OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FURTHER OUR POSITION AS A GLOBAL SUPPLIER OF INNOVATIVE E-BUSINESS SOLUTIONS WITH THE ADDITION OF ENTERPRISE COLLABORATION AND ENGAGEMENT SOLUTIONS SUCH AS OUR MOBILE AND CLOUD-BASED VMOSO, A COLLABORATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT PRODUCT, AND CLEARVALE, AN ESN PRODUCT.  TOGETHER WITH OUR LEGACY BUSINESS AGILITY SUITE, COMMERCE AGILITY SUITE AND QUICKSILVER SOLUTIONS, OUR NEW ENTERPRISE COLLABORATION AND ENGAGEMENT SOLUTIONS ARE DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE COMMUNICATION, COLLABORATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES OF ORGANIZATIONS WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS, PARTNERS AND EMPLOYEES TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY. IN 2017, WE ANNOUNCED A MAJOR INCREMENTAL RELEASE OF OUR VMOSO PLATFORM WITH A RANGE OF NEW FUNCTIONALITY ACROSS SEVERAL KEY MODULES.  \ufeff  WE GENERATE REVENUES FROM FEES FOR LICENSES OR ACCESS AND USE OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND RELATED MAINTENANCE, CONSULTING SERVICES AND CUSTOMER TRAINING. WE GENERALLY CHARGE FEES FOR LICENSES OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS BASED ON (1) THE NUMBER OF PERSONS REGISTERED TO USE THE PRODUCT; OR (2) THE NUMBER OF CPUS UTILIZED BY THE MACHINES ON WHICH THE PRODUCT IS INSTALLED. WE ALSO CHARGE FEES FOR ACCESS AND USE OF CLOUD OR SAAS SOLUTIONS. PAYMENT TERMS ARE GENERALLY 30 TO 60 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT THE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE DELIVERED, THE MAINTENANCE OR SUBSCRIPTION CONTRACTS ARE BOOKED, OR THE CONSULTING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED.  \ufeff  WE HAVE NOT GENERATED NET INCOME SINCE 2009  , EXCEPT THE GENERATION OF $0.6 MILLION OF NET INCOME  ATTRIBUTABLE TO BROADVISION  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE PROFITS OR POSITIVE CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS REMAINS UNCERTAIN.  \ufeff  OUR OPERATIONS FACE TWO KEY CHALLENGES: MATURITY OF OUR MAJOR REVENUE-GENERATING LEGACY PRODUCTS, AND COMPETING IN A CROWDED ESN SOLUTION SPACE.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST HEAVILY IN CLOUD-BASED, MOBILE, MESSAGING AND COLLABORATION TECHNOLOGIES, WHILE CONTINUING TO SUPPORT OUR LEGACY BASE.  TOTAL REVENUES OF $1.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DECLINED FROM TOTAL REVENUES OF $1.6 MILLION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WITH THE DECREASE MAINLY IN LEGACY REVENUE. WE EXPECT THAT THE DECLINE IN OUR LEGACY REVENUE, WHICH IS THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE MIX, WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE OUR OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNTIL A SIGNIFICANT INSTALLED BASE OF NEW PRODUCT REVENUES IS ESTABLISHED. WE ARE CONTINUING TO DILIGENTLY INVEST IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES IN THE MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS AND COLLABORATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SPACES.  16                    RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  \ufeff  MYVMOSO NETWORK PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES  \ufeff  IN 2018, WE BEGAN WORKING ON INITIATIVES TO DEVELOP AND ADVANCE A NEW PLATFORM, MYVMOSO NETWORK (MVN), A PERSONAL DIGITAL HUB THAT WILL UTILIZE OUR VMOSO PLATFORM IN CONJUNCTION WITH BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO ACT AS A BANK FOR CONSUMERS\u2019 PERSONAL DATA, AS WELL AS PROVIDE SECURE, PERSONALIZED, PERSISTENT, SYMMETRICAL ENGAGEMENT CHANNELS BETWEEN CONSUMERS AND THE BUSINESSES WITH WHICH THEY HAVE RELATIONSHIPS. MVN IS BEING DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE SECURE STORAGE FOR IMPORTANT DATA SUCH AS HEALTH RECORDS, FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, PRODUCT PURCHASES AND WARRANTIES, SUCH THAT USERS CAN TRUST, UNIFY, MANAGE AND MONETIZE THEIR PERSONAL DATA.

EXAMPLES OF THE TYPES OF ACTIONS THAT WOULD ENTITLE A USER TO RECEIVE CRYPTOCURRENCY TOKENS FROM THIRD PARTIES INCLUDE LOADING PERSONAL PROFILE INFORMATION, PURCHASING HISTORY AND OTHER PERSONAL DATA INTO THE NETWORK, ALLOWING A THIRD PARTY TO USE PERSONAL DATA FOR A SPECIFIED PURPOSE, AND RESPONDING TO A THIRD-PARTY PRODUCT OFFER OR SURVEY. COMPENSATION WOULD BE MADE THROUGH SMALL TRANSACTION FEES PAID BY THE THIRD PARTIES.  \ufeff  VMSO FINANCING  \ufeff  IN JANUARY 2019, WE PURCHASED 745,000 SHARES OF VMSO\u2019S SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK IN EXCHANGE FOR OUR CONTRIBUTION TO VMSO OF ASSETS REPRESENTING ALL OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER ASSETS RELATING TO OUR CLEARVALE AND VMOSO PLATFORMS, INCLUDING THE CLEARVALE AND VMOSO PRODUCTS AND THE MVN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. FOLLOWING THE PURCHASE, WE OWN SERIES A PREFERRED SHARES OF VMSO REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 19.9% OF OUTSTANDING SHARES OF VMSO.  IN JANUARY 2019, VMSO RAISED $3 MILLION FROM DR.

THE VARIANCES BETWEEN THE PERIODS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO GAIN FROM SALE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO VMSO OFFSET BY LOSSES FROM THE REMEASUREMENT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATION ON OUR EURO CASH BALANCES.  INCOME TAXES.  THE INCOME TAX EXPENSE  WAS $4,000 AND $1,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  19                    \ufeff  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OVERVIEW  \ufeff  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD A NET LOSS OF $0.1 MILLION AND NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $0.02 MILLION, AND AT MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL OF $4.1 MILLION. AT MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $5.7 MILLION. OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 INCREASED $3.1 MILLION COMPARED TO THE BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018. THIS INCREASE WAS MAINLY DUE TO OUR JANUARY 2019 VMSO FINANCING.  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS MAY FLUCTUATE DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019 DUE TO VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE RISKS DETAILED IN PART II, ITEM 1A TITLED \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d.  BASED ON OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PLAN, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND OPERATING RESOURCE EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. HOWEVER, WE COULD EXPERIENCE UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, DIFFICULTIES IN RETAINING CUSTOMERS AND/OR EMPLOYEES, OR OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD INCREASE OUR USE OF AVAILABLE CASH AND REQUIRE US TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FINANCING. WE MAY FIND IT NECESSARY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING DUE TO THE FACTORS LISTED ABOVE OR IN ORDER TO SUPPORT A MORE RAPID EXPANSION, DEVELOP NEW OR ENHANCED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, ACQUIRE COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES OR RESPOND TO UNANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS.  \ufeff  OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS INCLUDING GROWTH OR DECLINE IN CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS, THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF SPENDING TO SUPPORT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS AND ONGOING INVESTMENTS IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY, AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL EXPENSES GENERALLY. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED COST REDUCTION PLANS SINCE THE SECOND HALF OF 2017 TO REDUCE OUR CASH NEEDS AND REDUCED THE COST OF OUR OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION IN 2018. IN JANUARY 2019, WE COMPLETED THE VMSO FINANCING, PURSUANT TO WHICH VMSO RAISED $3 MILLION IN CASH FROM OUR AND VMSO\u2019S PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OUR LARGEST STOCKHOLDER, DR. CHEN, AND VMSO NOW HOLDS ALL OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND OTHER ASSETS RELATED TO OUR CLEARVALE AND VMOSO PLATFORMS, REDUCING OUR EXPOSURE TO FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION COST OF CLEARVALE, VMOSO AND MVN. HOWEVER, FURTHER COST REDUCTIONS MAY RESULT IN VOLUNTARY DEPARTURES OF HIGHLY SKILLED TECHNICAL AND MANAGERIAL PERSONNEL FROM OUR COMPANY, WHICH WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, INTERNAL CONTROLS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  WE EXPECT TO OPPORTUNISTICALLY SEEK TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH PRIVATE OR PUBLIC SALES OF SECURITIES, STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS, BANK DEBT, FINANCING UNDER LEASING ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHERWISE. IF ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE RAISED THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, THE PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP OF OUR CURRENT STOCKHOLDERS WILL BE REDUCED, STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL DILUTION OR ANY EQUITY SECURITIES WE SELL MAY HAVE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES OR PRIVILEGES SENIOR TO THOSE OF THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE EXPECT THAT OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS WOULD BE DIFFICULT, AT BEST. IF ADEQUATE FUNDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE OR ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PAY OUR DEBTS AS THEY BECOME DUE, DEVELOP OUR PRODUCTS, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES OR RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES OR UNANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS CANNOT BE PREDICTED AT THIS TIME. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISH THESE PLANS AND SECURE SOURCES OF FINANCING AND/OR REDUCE COSTS AND ULTIMATELY ATTAIN PROFITABLE OPERATIONS.  \ufeff  THE FOLLOWING TABLE REPRESENTS OUR LIQUIDITY AT MARCH 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).  \ufeff  \ufeff                                                  \ufeff          MARCH 31,          DECEMBER 31,  \ufeff          2018          2018  \ufeff                                                  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS          $5,671                $2,574        WORKING CAPITAL          $4,067                $1,853        WORKING CAPITAL RATIO                  2.44                        1.98        \ufeff  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING ACTIVITIES  \ufeff  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $0.02 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, AND WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A $0.1 MILLION OPERATING LOSS OFFSET BY NONCASH ITEMS AND CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  WAS 25.6% DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE WAS 28.0% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECLINE  VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF OPERATING LEVERAGE THAT ARISES FROM LOWER NET SALES RELATIVE  TO FIXED COSTS, INCREASED TRADE PROMOTION INVESTMENT, AND HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PRICING WHICH  COMMENCED DURING SECOND QUARTER 2018, AND A REDUCTION IN VARIABLE COSTS. ADDITIONALLY, DEPRECIATION EXPENSE INCREASED REFLECTING  THE CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN MANUFACTURING IMPROVEMENTS.  SELLING EXPENSES  SELLING EXPENSES DECREASED BY $879 OR 21.9%  TO $3,139 DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 FROM $4,018 DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE DECREASE VERSUS PRIOR  YEAR, PRIMARILY REFLECTS A REDUCTION IN ADVERTISING AND MARKETING PROGRAMS WITH LOWER EFFICIENCY, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT COMPENSATION  SAVINGS FROM ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES MADE IN 2018, AND BROKER COMMISSIONS. SELLING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WERE 12.8%  DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 14.0% FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  18  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED  $214 OR 5.8% TO $3,491 DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 FROM $3,705 DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE DECREASE  IS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF LOWER COMPENSATION EXPENSE DUE TO ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES MADE IN 2018, AND DECREASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX INCLUDES FEDERAL,  STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES. BENEFIT FOR INCOME TAXES WAS $54 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO A PROVISION  FOR INCOME TAXES OF $38 DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE (ETR) FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS 12.2% COMPARED TO AN ETR OF 35.1% IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE LOWER EFFECTIVE  TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SEPARATE STATE TAX RATES, CHANGE IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE AND NON-DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSE AMOUNTS BEING  A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF PRE-TAX INCOME. DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE RECOGNIZED NON-DEDUCTIBLE COMPENSATION  EXPENSE RELATED TO THE 2017 LTIP AWARDS. THIS RESULTED IN A PERMANENT RATE EFFECT AND WAS CONSIDERED IN THE ESTIMATED FULL YEAR  TAX RATE.  SECTION 162(M) OF THE CODE LIMITS THE DEDUCTIBILITY  OF COMPENSATION PAID TO CERTAIN OF OUR EXECUTIVES. UNDER THE ACT\u2019S AMENDMENTS TO SECTION 162(M), NO TAX DEDUCTION IN TAXABLE  YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017 IS ALLOWED FOR COMPENSATION PAID TO ANY COVERED EMPLOYEE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE TOTAL COMPENSATION  FOR THAT COVERED EMPLOYEE EXCEEDS $1,000,000 IN ANY TAXABLE YEAR. ALTHOUGH THE ACT ELIMINATED THE PRIOR TAX DEDUCTION UNDER SECTION  162(M) FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION, IT INCLUDED A TRANSITION RULE UNDER WHICH THE CHANGES TO SECTION 162(M) WILL  NOT APPLY TO AWARDS MADE TO OUR COVERED EMPLOYEES WHO HAD THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR 2015 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN PURSUANT  TO WRITTEN BINDING CONTRACTS IN EFFECT AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2017, AS LONG AS THOSE CONTRACTS HAVE NOT SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN MODIFIED IN  ANY MATERIAL RESPECT. ACCORDINGLY, SUBJECT TO FURTHER GUIDANCE FROM THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (\u201cIRS\u201d),  WE EXPECT THAT PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR EXECUTIVES UNDER OUR OMNIBUS PLAN WILL REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR THE SECTION  162(M) EXEMPTION IN 2019.  INCOME TAXES ARE  DISCUSSED IN NOTE 10 IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  NET (LOSS) INCOME  WE REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $(388) OR $(0.02)  PER BASIC AND DILUTED COMMON SHARE FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF $70 OR $0.00 PER  BASIC AND DILUTED COMMON SHARE IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR FORESEEABLE LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS THROUGH ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS; OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY; AND CASH AND CASH  EQUIVALENTS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCING STRATEGIES WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE US WITH THE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF VARIOUS OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY ARISE.  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH  LIFEWAY HAD A NET DECREASE IN CASH AND  CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $474 DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED TO A NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  OF $1,256 IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE DRIVERS OF THE YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE ARE AS FOLLOWS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  WAS $1,182 DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $853 IN  THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY RESULTS FROM $1,545 OF FEDERAL AND STATE  INCOME TAX REFUNDS RECEIVED IN Q1 2019, OFFSET BY THE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL.  19  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $121 DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED TO NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $847 IN THE SAME PERIOD  IN 2018. THE LOWER LEVEL OF NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2019 REFLECTS LOWER CAPITAL SPENDING. CAPITAL SPENDING WAS  $137 DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $879 IN 2018. OUR CAPITAL SPENDING IS FOCUSED IN THREE CORE  AREAS: GROWTH, COST REDUCTION, AND FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS. GROWTH CAPITAL SPENDING SUPPORTS NEW PRODUCT INNOVATION AND ENHANCEMENTS.  COST REDUCTION SPENDING SUPPORTS MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY, SAFETY AND PRODUCTIVITY.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $1,535 DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED TO NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $1,262 IN THE SAME  PERIOD IN 2018. WE UTILIZED PROCEEDS FROM OUR FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX REFUNDS TO REPAY $1,330 ON OUR REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT  DURING THE THREE-MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. ON NOVEMBER 1, 2017, LIFEWAY\u2019S BOARD APPROVED AN INCREASE IN THE AGGREGATE  AMOUNT UNDER OUR PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED 2015 STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM (THE \u201c2017 REPURCHASE PLAN AMENDMENT\u201d), BY ADDING  TO (I.E., EXCLUSIVE OF THE SHARES PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED UNDER THE 2015 STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM) THE AUTHORIZATION THE LESSER OF  $5,185 OR 625 SHARES. WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 82 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A COST OF $205 DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019 UNDER THE 2017 REPURCHASE PLAN AMENDMENT. WE MAY EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE OPEN MARKET OR BY  PRIVATE NEGOTIATION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WE INTEND TO HOLD REPURCHASED SHARES IN  TREASURY FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING ISSUANCES UNDER OUR 2015 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN. TREASURY SHARES ARE ACCOUNTED  FOR USING THE COST METHOD.  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  ON APRIL 10, 2019, EFFECTIVE MARCH 31,  2019, LIFEWAY ENTERED INTO THE FIRST MODIFICATION TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT (THE \u201cMODIFIED  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d) WITH ITS EXISTING LENDER. UNDER THE AMENDMENT, THE MODIFIED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES  FOR A REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT UP TO A MAXIMUM OF $9 MILLION (THE \u201cREVOLVING LOAN\u201d) WITH AN INCREMENTAL FACILITY NOT  TO EXCEED $5 MILLION (THE \u201cINCREMENTAL FACILITY\u201d AND TOGETHER WITH THE REVOLVING LOAN, THE \u201cLOANS\u201d).  ALL OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS UNDER THE LOANS  BEAR INTEREST, BASED ON A LEVEL OF THE SENIOR DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO, AT LIFEWAY\u2019S ELECTION, AT EITHER THE LENDER BASE RATE  (THE GREATER OF EITHER THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE PLUS 0.0% TO 0.5%, OR THE PRIME RATE) OR THE LIBOR PLUS 2.25% TO 3.00%, PAYABLE MONTHLY  IN ARREARS. LIFEWAY IS ALSO REQUIRED TO PAY A QUARTERLY UNUSED LINE FEE AND, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF ANY LETTERS OF  CREDIT, A LETTER OF CREDIT FEE.  AS AMENDED, THE MODIFIED REVOLVING CREDIT  FACILITY CONTAINS CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND COVENANTS ON THE PART OF LIFEWAY, INCLUDING FINANCIAL COVENANTS REQUIRING  US TO ACHIEVE A MINIMUM EBITDA THRESHOLD FOR EACH OF THE FISCAL QUARTERS THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND MAINTAIN A FIXED CHARGE  COVERAGE RATIO OF NO LESS THAN 1.25 TO 1.0 EACH OF THE FISCAL QUARTERS ENDING THROUGH THE EXPIRATION DATE. THE MODIFIED REVOLVING  CREDIT FACILITY ALSO PROVIDES FOR EVENTS OF DEFAULT, INCLUDING FAILURE TO REPAY PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WHEN DUE AND FAILURE TO  PERFORM OR VIOLATION OF THE PROVISIONS OR COVENANTS OF THE AGREEMENT, AS A RESULT OF WHICH AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE MODIFIED REVOLVING  CREDIT FACILITY MAY BE ACCELERATED.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (\"WE\", \"AGILENT\" OR THE \"COMPANY\"), INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN MAY 1999, IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN LIFE SCIENCES, DIAGNOSTICS AND APPLIED CHEMICAL MARKETS, PROVIDING APPLICATION FOCUSED SOLUTIONS THAT INCLUDE INSTRUMENTS, SOFTWARE, SERVICES AND CONSUMABLES FOR THE ENTIRE LABORATORY WORKFLOW.  ON NOVEMBER 14, 2018, WE ACQUIRED 100 PERCENT OF THE STOCK OF ACEA BIOSCIENCES (\u201cACEA\u201d), A DEVELOPER OF CELL  ANALYSIS TOOLS, FOR APPROXIMATELY  $250 MILLION  IN CASH. THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF ACEA HAVE BEEN INCLUDED WITHIN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM THE DATE OF THE CLOSE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  HAD AN OVERALL  UNFAVORABLE  IMPACT ON REVENUE OF APPROXIMATELY  3  PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR BOTH PERIODS WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS LAST YEAR.  REVENUE IN THE LIFE SCIENCES AND APPLIED MARKETS BUSINESS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  ,  DECREASED  1 PERCENT  AND WAS FLAT, RESPECTIVELY, WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS LAST YEAR.

ON NOVEMBER 19, 2018 WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD APPROVED A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM (THE \"2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM\") DESIGNED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE DILUTION RESULTING FROM ISSUANCE OF STOCK UNDER THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. THE 2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZES THE PURCHASE OF UP TO  $1.75 BILLION  OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT THE COMPANY'S DISCRETION AND HAS NO FIXED TERMINATION DATE. THE 2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES AND MAY BE SUSPENDED, AMENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY  638,000  SHARES FOR  $50 MILLION  AND  1.766 MILLION  SHARES FOR  $125 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION.

AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE HAD REMAINING AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE UP TO  $1.625 BILLION  OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THIS PROGRAM.  ON MAY 28, 2015, WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD APPROVED A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM (THE \"2015 REPURCHASE PROGRAM\").

LOOKING FORWARD, DESPITE CHALLENGING MARKET CONDITIONS, WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON DIFFERENTIATING PRODUCT SOLUTIONS, IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMERS' EXPERIENCE AND  GROWING OUR EARNINGS. IN ADDITION, WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON A BALANCED CAPITAL ALLOCATION THROUGH OUR DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. WE EXPECT FOREIGN CURRENCY TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT REVENUE FOR THE REST OF 2019 BUT WE ALSO ANTICIPATE THE CONTRIBUTION FROM OUR SEVERAL ACQUISITIONS IN THE PAST YEAR TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE CURRENCY IMPACT.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) IN THE U.S. THE PREPARATION OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP IN THE U.S. REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE THAT AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MATERIALLY AND INVOLVE DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS BY MANAGEMENT. THOSE POLICIES ARE REVENUE RECOGNITION, INVENTORY VALUATION, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, RETIREMENT AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSUMPTIONS, GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. OTHER THAN ACCOUNTING FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION AND INCOME TAXES AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS DESCRIBED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2018  . MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. ALTHOUGH THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST KNOWLEDGE OF CURRENT EVENTS AND ACTIONS THAT MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY IN THE FUTURE, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE ESTIMATES.  AN ACCOUNTING POLICY IS DEEMED TO BE CRITICAL IF IT REQUIRES AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE TO BE MADE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME THE ESTIMATE IS MADE AND IF DIFFERENT ESTIMATES THAT REASONABLY COULD HAVE BEEN USED OR CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR COULD MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  .    ON NOVEMBER 1, 2018, WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARD CODIFICATION TOPIC 606,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (\"ASC 606\").  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS TO SELL PRODUCTS (HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE), SERVICES AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS (MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS) THAT INCLUDE COMBINATIONS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  WE DERIVE REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF ANALYTICAL AND DIAGNOSTICS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS A PROMISE IN A CONTRACT TO TRANSFER A DISTINCT PRODUCT OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER AND IS THE UNIT OF ACCOUNT UNDER ASC 606. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PROMISED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IS TRANSFERRED TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS FULFILLED IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION THAT WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, THE TRANSACTION PRICE. FOR EQUIPMENT, CONSUMABLES, AND MOST SOFTWARE LICENSES SOLD BY US, CONTROL TRANSFERS TO THE CUSTOMER AT A POINT IN TIME. WE USE PRESENT RIGHT TO PAYMENT, LEGAL TITLE, PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE ASSET, AND RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP AS INDICATORS TO DETERMINE THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO THE CUSTOMER. WHERE ACCEPTANCE IS NOT A FORMALITY, THE CUSTOMER MUST HAVE DOCUMENTED THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE. FOR PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE INSTALLATION, IF THE INSTALLATION MEETS THE CRITERIA TO BE CONSIDERED A SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, PRODUCT REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL HAS PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, AND RECOGNITION OF INSTALLATION REVENUE OCCURS ONCE COMPLETED. PRODUCT REVENUE, INCLUDING SALES TO RESELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS IS REDUCED FOR PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTIES, RETURNS, AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED.  REVENUE FROM SERVICES INCLUDES EXTENDED WARRANTY, CUSTOMER AND SOFTWARE SUPPORT INCLUDING: SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE, POST CONTRACT SUPPORT, CONSULTING INCLUDING COMPANION DIAGNOSTICS, AND TRAINING AND EDUCATION. INSTRUMENT SERVICE CONTRACTS AND SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY ANNUAL CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE BILLED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CONTRACT OR MAINTENANCE PERIOD. THESE CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO REVENUE OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD, AS A TIME-BASED MEASURE OF PROGRESS BEST REFLECTS OUR PERFORMANCE IN SATISFYING THIS OBLIGATION. THERE ARE NO DEFERRED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE CONTRACT, AS THE COST OF THE SERVICE IS RECORDED WHEN THE SERVICE IS PERFORMED. SERVICE CALLS ARE RECOGNIZED TO REVENUE AT THE TIME A SERVICE IS PERFORMED.  WE HAVE  SALES FROM STANDALONE SOFTWARE. THESE ARRANGEMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE SOFTWARE LICENSES AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS, BOTH OF WHICH WE HAVE DETERMINED ARE DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. WE DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO ALLOCATE TO THE LICENSE AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACT BASED ON THE RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE OF EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT THE POINT IN TIME WHEN CONTROL HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. THE REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE CONTRACT IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE MAINTENANCE PERIOD, WHICH IS THE CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THE CONTRACT, AS A TIME-BASED MEASURE OF PROGRESS BEST REFLECTS OUR PERFORMANCE IN SATISFYING THIS OBLIGATION. UNSPECIFIED RIGHTS TO SOFTWARE UPGRADES ARE TYPICALLY SOLD AS PART OF THE MAINTENANCE CONTRACT ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS.  OUR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY COMPRISED OF A COMBINATION OF INSTRUMENTS, INSTALLATION OR OTHER START-UP SERVICES, AND/OR SOFTWARE, AND/OR SUPPORT OR SERVICES. HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ELEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY DELIVERED AT THE SAME TIME AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER. SERVICE REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE CONTRACTUAL PERIOD OR AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER. OUR ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY PROVISIONS FOR CANCELLATION, TERMINATION, OR REFUNDS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT RECOGNIZED REVENUE.  FOR CONTRACTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, WE ALLOCATE THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BASED ON RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICES AND RECOGNIZE THE RELATED REVENUE WHEN OR AS CONTROL OF EACH INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS. WE ESTIMATE THE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE BY CALCULATING THE AVERAGE HISTORICAL SELLING PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PER COUNTRY FOR EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICES ARE DETERMINED AT CONTRACT INCEPTION FOR EACH DISTINCT GOOD OR SERVICE IN THE CONTRACT AND THEN WE ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE IN PROPORTION TO THOSE STANDALONE SELLING PRICES BY PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  CERTAIN OF OUR REVENUE RELATE TO LEASE ARRANGEMENTS. STANDALONE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF ASC 606 AND ARE THEREFORE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 840, LEASES. EACH OF THESE CONTRACTS IS EVALUATED AS A LEASE ARRANGEMENT, EITHER AS AN OPERATING LEASE OR A SALES-TYPE CAPITAL LEASE USING THE CURRENT LEASE CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE.  ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES.  WE MUST MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OCCUR IN THE CALCULATION OF TAX CREDITS, BENEFITS AND DEDUCTIONS, AND IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WHICH ARISE FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES, AS WELL AS INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THESE ESTIMATES MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX PROVISION IN A SUBSEQUENT PERIOD. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WE PROVIDE FOR INCOME TAXES BASED UPON AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE GEOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF WORLDWIDE EARNINGS, TAX REGULATIONS GOVERNING EACH REGION, AVAILABILITY OF TAX CREDITS AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES.  WE MONITOR THE CHANGES IN MANY FACTORS AND ADJUST OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE ON A TIMELY BASIS.  IF ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHETHER DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED IN FULL OR IN PART. WHEN IT IS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT ALL OR SOME PORTION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS MAY NOT BE REALIZED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE MUST BE ESTABLISHED AGAINST SUCH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE ON A JURISDICTION-BY-JURISDICTION BASIS WHEN ASSESSING WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE RECOVERABLE. WE CONSIDER EVIDENCE SUCH AS OUR PAST OPERATING RESULTS, THE EXISTENCE OF LOSSES IN RECENT YEARS AND OUR FORECAST OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. AT  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN U.S. AND U.S STATE AND FOREIGN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN THESE JURISDICTIONS UNTIL SUFFICIENT POSITIVE EVIDENCE EXISTS TO SUPPORT ITS REVERSAL.  THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX LAW AND REGULATIONS IN A MULTITUDE OF JURISDICTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES PRESCRIBES THE USE OF A RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT MODEL, THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION HAS MET THOSE THRESHOLDS WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT BY MANAGEMENT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES, FOR ALL U.S. AND OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS, WE RECOGNIZE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED TAX AUDIT ISSUES BASED ON OUR ESTIMATE OF WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL TAXES AND INTEREST WILL BE DUE. THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF TAX UNCERTAINTIES MAY DIFFER FROM WHAT IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPACT ON INCOME TAX EXPENSE. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF INCOME TAX LIABILITIES PROVES TO BE LESS THAN THE ULTIMATE ASSESSMENT, A FURTHER CHARGE TO EXPENSE WOULD BE REQUIRED. IF EVENTS OCCUR AND THE PAYMENT OF THESE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY PROVES TO BE UNNECESSARY, THE REVERSAL OF THE LIABILITIES WOULD RESULT IN TAX BENEFITS BEING RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD WHEN WE DETERMINE THE LIABILITIES ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY. WE INCLUDE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WITHIN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX ACT WAS ENACTED INTO LAW. THE TAX ACT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGES THE EXISTING U.S. TAX LAW AND INCLUDES NUMEROUS PROVISIONS THAT AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. THERE WERE NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES FROM OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K TO THE TRANSITION TAX EXPENSES AMOUNT. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE FURTHER GUIDANCE FROM FEDERAL AND STATE TAX AUTHORITIES ON ITS BUSINESS AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ANY FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS DISCRETE INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE DETERMINED. WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR ANALYSIS AND ELECTED TO TREAT GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAX INCOME (\"GILTI\") AS \u201cCURRENT PERIOD COST\u201d.  SEE NOTE 5, \"INCOME TAXES\" FOR MORE DETAILS.  ADOPTION OF NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE NOTE 2, \u201cNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS,\u201d TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  FOREIGN CURRENCY  OUR REVENUES, COSTS AND EXPENSES, AND MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AS A RESULT OF OUR GLOBAL OPERATING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAS DECREASED REVENUE BY APPROXIMATELY  3  PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  . WHEN MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON REVENUE IT WILL ALSO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR COSTS AND EXPENSES. WE CALCULATE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES MOVEMENTS BY APPLYING THE ACTUAL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE LAST MONTH OF EACH QUARTER OF THE CURRENT YEAR TO BOTH THE APPLICABLE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. WE HEDGE REVENUES, EXPENSES AND BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES THAT ARE NOT DENOMINATED IN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ON A SHORT TERM AND ANTICIPATED BASIS. WE DO EXPERIENCE SOME FLUCTUATIONS WITHIN INDIVIDUAL LINES OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND BALANCE SHEET BECAUSE OUR HEDGING PROGRAM IS NOT DESIGNED TO OFFSET THE CURRENCY MOVEMENTS IN EACH CATEGORY OF REVENUES, EXPENSES, MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO HEDGE CURRENCY MOVEMENTS ON A RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM BASIS (UP TO A ROLLING TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD). THEREFORE, WE ARE EXPOSED TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OVER THE LONGER TERM. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR ALL, OR PORTIONS, OF AN ACQUISITION PRICE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WE MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE THE RISK THAT CURRENCY MOVEMENTS WILL IMPACT THE U.S. DOLLAR COST OF THE TRANSACTION.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS  NET REVENUE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  SIX MONTHS ENDED  YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE  APRIL 30,  APRIL 30,  THREE  SIX  2019  2018  2019  2018  MONTHS  MONTHS  (IN MILLIONS)  NET REVENUE.

GILTI.  THE TAX ACT SUBJECTS A U.S. CORPORATION TO TAX ON ITS GILTI.  U.S. GAAP ALLOWS COMPANIES TO MAKE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO EITHER (1) TREAT TAXES DUE ON FUTURE GILTI INCLUSIONS IN THE U.S. TAXABLE INCOME AS A CURRENT-PERIOD EXPENSE WHEN INCURRED (\u201cPERIOD COST METHOD\u201d) OR (2) FACTORING SUCH AMOUNTS INTO A COMPANY\u2019S MEASUREMENT OF ITS DEFERRED TAXES (\u201cDEFERRED METHOD\u201d).

THERE WERE NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES FROM OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K TO THE STATUS OF THE OPEN TAX YEARS IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS DUE TO EITHER THE EXPIRATION OF A STATUTE OF LIMITATION OR A TAX AUDIT SETTLEMENT. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF YEARS AND NUMEROUS MATTERS THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION IN VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS, MANAGEMENT IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE CHANGES TO THE BALANCE OF OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE FURTHER GUIDANCE FROM FEDERAL AND STATE TAX AUTHORITIES ON ITS BUSINESS AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ANY FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS DISCRETE INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE DETERMINED.

ALL OTHER RATES ARE CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE APPLICABLE AMOUNT BY TOTAL REVENUE.  SALES  SALES INCLUDE ALL MERCHANDISE SALES, NET OF EXPECTED RETURNS, AND GIFT CARD BREAKAGE. COMPARABLE SALES IS A MEASURE THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR STORES AND DIGITAL CHANNEL BY MEASURING THE CHANGE IN SALES FOR A PERIOD OVER THE COMPARABLE, PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD OF EQUIVALENT LENGTH. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDE ALL SALES, EXCEPT SALES FROM STORES OPEN LESS THAN 13 MONTHS, DIGITAL ACQUISITIONS WE HAVE OWNED LESS THAN 13 MONTHS, STORES THAT HAVE BEEN CLOSED, AND DIGITAL ACQUISITIONS THAT WE NO LONGER OPERATE. COMPARABLE SALES MEASURES VARY ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, OUR COMPARABLE SALES CALCULATION IS NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. DIGITALLY ORIGINATED SALES INCLUDE ALL SALES INITIATED THROUGH MOBILE APPLICATIONS AND OUR WEBSITES. OUR STORES FULFILL THE MAJORITY OF DIGITALLY ORIGINATED SALES, INCLUDING SHIPMENT FROM STORES TO GUESTS, STORE PICK-UP OR DRIVE-UP, AND DELIVERY VIA OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, SHIPT. DIGITALLY ORIGINATED SALES MAY ALSO BE FULFILLED THROUGH OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, OUR VENDORS, OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES.  THE INCREASE IN SALES DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  , IS DUE TO A COMPARABLE SALES INCREASE OF  4.8 PERCENT  AND THE CONTRIBUTION FROM NEW STORES.

THE COLLECTIVE INTERACTION OF A BROAD ARRAY OF MACROECONOMIC, COMPETITIVE, AND CONSUMER BEHAVIORAL FACTORS, AS WELL AS SALES MIX, AND TRANSFER OF SALES TO NEW STORES MAKES FURTHER ANALYSIS OF SALES METRICS INFEASIBLE.  WE MONITOR THE PERCENTAGE OF PURCHASES THAT ARE PAID FOR USING REDCARDS (REDCARD PENETRATION) BECAUSE OUR INTERNAL ANALYSIS HAS INDICATED THAT A MEANINGFUL PORTION OF THE INCREMENTAL PURCHASES ON REDCARDS ARE ALSO INCREMENTAL SALES FOR TARGET. GUESTS RECEIVE A 5 PERCENT DISCOUNT ON VIRTUALLY ALL PURCHASES WHEN THEY USE A REDCARD AT TARGET.

GROSS MARGIN RATE  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  , OUR GROSS MARGIN RATE WAS  29.6  PERCENT COMPARED WITH  29.8  PERCENT IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED DIGITAL FULFILLMENT AND SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE BENEFIT OF MERCHANDISING STRATEGIES, INCLUDING COST SAVINGS INITIATIVES AND EFFORTS TO IMPROVE PRICING AND PROMOTIONS.  13  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE RATE  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  , OUR SG&A EXPENSE RATE WAS  20.8  PERCENT COMPARED WITH  21.1  PERCENT IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE REFLECTS TECHNOLOGY-RELATED COST SAVINGS AND A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BENEFIT DUE TO TIMING OF MARKETING CAMPAIGNS, NEITHER OF WHICH WAS INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT. IN ADDITION, BROAD EXPENSE CONTROL, INCLUDING STORE LABOR PRODUCTIVITY, OFFSET PRESSURE FROM WAGE GROWTH.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RATE  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  , OUR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES) EXPENSE RATE WAS  3.3  PERCENT COMPARED WITH  3.4  PERCENT IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RATE IMPACT OF HIGHER SALES IN 2019.

THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, AS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.  14  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  , WAS  22.4 PERCENT  COMPARED WITH  22.6  PERCENT FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR.  RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP MEASURES  TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY, WE HAVE DISCLOSED NON-GAAP ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS (ADJUSTED EPS). THIS METRIC EXCLUDES CERTAIN ITEMS PRESENTED BELOW. WE BELIEVE THIS INFORMATION IS USEFUL IN PROVIDING PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF THE RESULTS OF OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS. THIS MEASURE IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH, OR AN ALTERNATIVE TO, GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE U.S. (GAAP). THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE IS DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. ADJUSTED EPS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTION FOR ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP. OTHER COMPANIES MAY CALCULATE ADJUSTED EPS DIFFERENTLY, LIMITING THE USEFULNESS OF THE MEASURE FOR COMPARISONS WITH OTHER COMPANIES.

EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME TAXES (EBIT) AND EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EBITDA) ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES WHICH WE BELIEVE PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY COMPARED WITH OUR COMPETITORS BY EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENCES IN TAX JURISDICTIONS AND STRUCTURES, DEBT LEVELS, AND FOR EBITDA, CAPITAL INVESTMENT. THESE MEASURES ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH, OR AN ALTERNATIVE TO, GAAP. THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE IS NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. EBIT AND EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTION FOR ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP. OTHER COMPANIES MAY CALCULATE EBIT AND EBITDA DIFFERENTLY, LIMITING THE USEFULNESS OF THE MEASURE FOR COMPARISONS WITH OTHER COMPANIES.

(F)  INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  (G)  AVERAGE BASED ON THE INVESTED CAPITAL AT THE END OF THE CURRENT PERIOD AND THE INVESTED CAPITAL AT THE END OF THE COMPARABLE PRIOR PERIOD.  ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE WAS  $1,173 MILLION  AT  MAY 4, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  $1,060 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE INCLUDES SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF $419 MILLION, $769 MILLION, AND $311 MILLION AS OF MAY 4, 2019, FEBRUARY 2, 2019, AND MAY 5, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OUR INVESTMENT POLICY IS DESIGNED TO PRESERVE PRINCIPAL AND LIQUIDITY OF OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. THIS POLICY ALLOWS INVESTMENTS IN LARGE MONEY MARKET FUNDS OR IN HIGHLY RATED DIRECT SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS THAT MATURE IN 60 DAYS OR LESS. WE ALSO PLACE DOLLAR LIMITS ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL FUNDS OR INSTRUMENTS.  CAPITAL ALLOCATION  WE FOLLOW A DISCIPLINED AND BALANCED APPROACH TO CAPITAL ALLOCATION BASED ON THE FOLLOWING PRIORITIES, RANKED IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE: FIRST, WE FULLY INVEST IN OPPORTUNITIES TO PROFITABLY GROW OUR BUSINESS, CREATE SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM VALUE, AND MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS AND ASSETS; SECOND, WE MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AND SEEK TO GROW IT ANNUALLY; AND FINALLY, WE RETURN ANY EXCESS CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS BY REPURCHASING SHARES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF OUR CREDIT RATING GOALS.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS  OPERATING CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY CONTINUING OPERATIONS WAS  $323 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  $512 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . THE OPERATING CASH FLOW  DECREASE  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER CASH SETTLEMENT OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, DRIVEN BY ELEVATED INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE LEVELS AS OF FEBRUARY 2, 2019, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN INVENTORY DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019.  INVENTORY  INVENTORY WAS  $9,060 MILLION  AS OF  MAY 4, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  $9,497 MILLION  AND  $8,652 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , AND  MAY 5, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE FROM FEBRUARY 2, 2019, REFLECTS A REDUCTION FROM ELEVATED YEAR-END INVENTORY LEVELS. INVENTORY INCREASED FROM MAY 5, 2018 TO SUPPORT CURRENT AND EXPECTED SALES AND OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE IN-STOCK LEVELS, INCLUDING MARKET SHARE OPPORTUNITIES IN TOYS AND BABY-RELATED MERCHANDISE.  DIVIDENDS  WE PAID DIVIDENDS TOTALING  $330 MILLION  (  $0.64  PER SHARE) AND  $334 MILLION  (  $0.62  PER SHARE) FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  , AND  MAY 5, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, A PER SHARE INCREASE OF  3.2  PERCENT. WE DECLARED DIVIDENDS TOTALING  $330 MILLION  (  $0.64  PER SHARE) DURING THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  , A PER SHARE INCREASE OF  3.2  PERCENT OVER THE  $333 MILLION  (  $0.62  PER SHARE) OF DECLARED DIVIDENDS DURING THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  . WE HAVE PAID DIVIDENDS EVERY QUARTER SINCE OUR 1967 INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING, AND IT IS OUR INTENT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE.  SHARE REPURCHASE  WE RETURNED $277 MILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  . SEE PART II, ITEM 2 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION.  16  FINANCING  OUR FINANCING STRATEGY IS TO ENSURE LIQUIDITY AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, TO MAINTAIN A BALANCED SPECTRUM OF DEBT MATURITIES, AND TO MANAGE OUR NET EXPOSURE TO FLOATING INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY. WITHIN THESE PARAMETERS, WE SEEK TO MINIMIZE OUR BORROWING COSTS. OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE LONG-TERM DEBT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKETS HAS PROVIDED US WITH AMPLE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. OUR CONTINUED ACCESS TO THESE MARKETS DEPENDS ON MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING THE CONDITION OF DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS, OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND MAINTAINING STRONG CREDIT RATINGS. AS OF  MAY 4, 2019  , OUR CREDIT RATINGS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  CREDIT RATINGS  MOODY\u2019S  STANDARD AND POOR\u2019S  FITCH  LONG-TERM DEBT  A2  A  A-  COMMERCIAL PAPER  P-1  A-1  F2  IF OUR CREDIT RATINGS WERE LOWERED, OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT MARKETS, OUR COST OF FUNDS, AND OTHER TERMS FOR NEW DEBT ISSUANCES COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. EACH OF THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES REVIEWS ITS RATING PERIODICALLY AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS WILL REMAIN THE SAME AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  , WE ISSUED $1.0 BILLION OF DEBT IN ADVANCE OF THE JUNE 2019 MATURITY OF $1.0 BILLION OF DEBT. NOTES 4 AND 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  WE HAVE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY THROUGH A COMMITTED $2.5 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OBTAINED THROUGH A GROUP OF BANKS. IN OCTOBER 2018, WE EXTENDED THIS CREDIT FACILITY BY ONE YEAR TO OCTOBER 2023. NO BALANCES WERE OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME DURING  2019  OR  2018.  MOST OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS CONTAIN COVENANTS RELATED TO SECURED DEBT LEVELS. IN ADDITION TO A SECURED DEBT LEVEL COVENANT, OUR CREDIT FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS A DEBT LEVERAGE COVENANT. WE ARE, AND EXPECT TO REMAIN, IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF  MAY 4, 2019  , NO NOTES OR DEBENTURES CONTAINED PROVISIONS REQUIRING ACCELERATION OF PAYMENT UPON A CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADE, EXCEPT THAT CERTAIN OUTSTANDING NOTES ALLOW THE NOTE HOLDERS TO PUT THE NOTES TO US IF WITHIN A MATTER OF MONTHS OF EACH OTHER WE EXPERIENCE BOTH (I) A CHANGE IN CONTROL; AND (II) OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ARE EITHER REDUCED AND THE RESULTING RATING IS NONINVESTMENT GRADE, OR OUR LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ARE PLACED ON WATCH FOR POSSIBLE REDUCTION AND THOSE RATINGS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REDUCED AND THE RESULTING RATING IS NONINVESTMENT GRADE.  WE BELIEVE OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE ADEQUATE TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS, FINANCE ANTICIPATED EXPANSION AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, FUND DEBT MATURITIES, PAY DIVIDENDS, AND EXECUTE PURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE CONTINUE TO ANTICIPATE AMPLE ACCESS TO COMMERCIAL PAPER AND LONG-TERM FINANCING.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, OTHER THAN THE NEW BORROWINGS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS SINCE  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  , AS REPORTED IN OUR  2018  FORM 10-K.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY OTHER RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  17  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  THIS REPORT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY ACCOMPANIED BY THE WORDS \u201cEXPECT,\u201d \u201cMAY,\u201d \u201cCOULD,\u201d \u201cBELIEVE,\u201d \u201cWOULD,\u201d \u201cMIGHT,\u201d \u201cANTICIPATES,\u201d OR SIMILAR WORDS. THE PRINCIPAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT INCLUDE: OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, STATEMENTS REGARDING THE ADEQUACY OF AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, THE FUNDING OF DEBT MATURITIES, THE CONTINUED EXECUTION OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, OUR EXPECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND NEW LEASE COMMITMENTS, THE EXPECTED COMPLIANCE WITH DEBT COVENANTS, THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, OUR INTENTIONS REGARDING FUTURE DIVIDENDS, THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF, AND ADEQUACY OF OUR RESERVES FOR, CLAIMS, LITIGATION AND THE RESOLUTION OF TAX MATTERS, THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS.

INTRODUCTION  LANDSTAR SYSTEM, INC. AND  ITS SUBSIDIARY, LANDSTAR SYSTEM HOLDINGS, INC. (TOGETHER, REFERRED TO HEREIN AS \u201cLANDSTAR\u201d OR THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d), IS A WORLDWIDE ASSET-LIGHT PROVIDER OF INTEGRATED TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. THE COMPANY OFFERS SERVICES TO  ITS CUSTOMERS ACROSS MULTIPLE TRANSPORTATION MODES, WITH THE ABILITY TO ARRANGE FOR INDIVIDUAL SHIPMENTS OF FREIGHT TO ENTERPRISE-WIDE SOLUTIONS TO MANAGE ALL OF A CUSTOMER\u2019S TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. LANDSTAR PROVIDES SERVICES PRINCIPALLY  THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN CANADA AND MEXICO, AND BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, MEXICO AND OTHER COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. THE COMPANY\u2019S SERVICES EMPHASIZE SAFETY, INFORMATION COORDINATION AND CUSTOMER  SERVICE AND ARE DELIVERED THROUGH A NETWORK OF OVER 1,200 INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS AND 68,000 THIRD PARTY CAPACITY PROVIDERS, PRIMARILY TRUCK CAPACITY PROVIDERS, LINKED TOGETHER BY A SERIES OF TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS WHICH ARE PROVIDED  AND COORDINATED BY THE COMPANY. THE NATURE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS IS SUCH THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS OPERATING COSTS VARIES DIRECTLY WITH REVENUE.  LANDSTAR MARKETS ITS INTEGRATED TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS AND EXCLUSIVELY  UTILIZES THIRD PARTY CAPACITY PROVIDERS TO TRANSPORT CUSTOMERS\u2019 FREIGHT. LANDSTAR\u2019S INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS ENTER INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE COMPANY AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOCATING FREIGHT, MAKING THAT FREIGHT  AVAILABLE TO LANDSTAR\u2019S CAPACITY PROVIDERS AND COORDINATING THE TRANSPORTATION OF THE FREIGHT WITH CUSTOMERS AND CAPACITY PROVIDERS. THE COMPANY\u2019S THIRD PARTY CAPACITY PROVIDERS CONSIST OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHO PROVIDE TRUCK CAPACITY  TO THE COMPANY UNDER EXCLUSIVE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS (THE \u201cBCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS\u201d), UNRELATED TRUCKING COMPANIES WHO PROVIDE TRUCK CAPACITY TO THE COMPANY UNDER  NON-EXCLUSIVE  CONTRACTUAL  ARRANGEMENTS (THE \u201cTRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS\u201d), AIR CARGO CARRIERS, OCEAN CARGO CARRIERS AND RAILROADS. THROUGH THIS NETWORK OF AGENTS AND CAPACITY PROVIDERS LINKED TOGETHER BY LANDSTAR\u2019S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, LANDSTAR  OPERATES AN INTEGRATED TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS BUSINESS PRIMARILY THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA WITH REVENUE OF $4.6 BILLION DURING THE MOST RECENTLY COMPLETED FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY REPORTS THE RESULTS OF TWO OPERATING SEGMENTS: THE  TRANSPORTATION LOGISTICS SEGMENT AND THE INSURANCE SEGMENT.  THE TRANSPORTATION LOGISTICS SEGMENT PROVIDES A WIDE RANGE OF INTEGRATED  TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. TRANSPORTATION SERVICES OFFERED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE TRUCKLOAD AND LESS-THAN-TRUCKLOAD TRANSPORTATION, RAIL INTERMODAL, AIR CARGO, OCEAN CARGO, EXPEDITED GROUND AND AIR DELIVERY OF TIME-CRITICAL FREIGHT,  HEAVY-HAUL/SPECIALIZED, U.S.-CANADA AND U.S.-MEXICO CROSS-BORDER, INTRA-MEXICO, INTRA-CANADA, PROJECT CARGO AND CUSTOMS BROKERAGE. EXAMPLES OF THE INDUSTRIES SERVICED BY THE TRANSPORTATION LOGISTICS SEGMENT INCLUDE AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTS, BUILDING  PRODUCTS, METALS, CHEMICALS, FOODSTUFFS, HEAVY MACHINERY, RETAIL, ELECTRONICS AND MILITARY EQUIPMENT. IN ADDITION, THE TRANSPORTATION LOGISTICS SEGMENT PROVIDES TRANSPORTATION SERVICES TO OTHER TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES, INCLUDING THIRD PARTY  LOGISTICS AND LESS-THAN-TRUCKLOAD SERVICE PROVIDERS. EACH OF THE INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MARKET ALL OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE TRANSPORTATION LOGISTICS SEGMENT. BILLINGS FOR FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION SERVICES ARE  TYPICALLY CHARGED TO CUSTOMERS ON A PER SHIPMENT BASIS FOR THE PHYSICAL TRANSPORTATION OF FREIGHT AND ARE REFERRED TO AS TRANSPORTATION REVENUE. DURING THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019, REVENUE GENERATED BY BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS,  TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS AND RAILROADS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 43%, 49% AND 3%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED REVENUE. COLLECTIVELY, REVENUE GENERATED BY AIR AND OCEAN CARGO CARRIERS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 3% OF THE  COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED REVENUE IN THE THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MARCH 30, 2019.  LANDSTAR METRO, S.A.P.I. DE C.V.  (\u201cLANDSTAR METRO\u201d) PROVIDES FREIGHT AND LOGISTICS SERVICES WITHIN THE COUNTRY OF MEXICO AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH LANDSTAR\u2019S U.S./MEXICO CROSS-BORDER SERVICES. LANDSTAR METRO SERVICIOS S.A.P.I. DE C.V. (\u201cLANDSTAR SERVICIOS\u201d)  PROVIDES VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL, OPERATIONAL, SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE SERVICES TO LANDSTAR METRO. THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM LANDSTAR METRO AND LANDSTAR SERVICIOS ARE PRESENTED AS PART OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TRANSPORTATION LOGISTICS  SEGMENT. ON JANUARY 29, 2019, LANDSTAR ACQUIRED ALL OF THE REMAINING EQUITY INTERESTS IN LANDSTAR METRO AND LANDSTAR SERVICIOS HELD BY THEIR FORMER MINORITY EQUITYHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, AS OF SUCH DATE, LANDSTAR METRO AND LANDSTAR SERVICIOS EACH  BECAME WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY. REVENUE FROM LANDSTAR METRO REPRESENTED LESS THAN 1% OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TRANSPORTATION LOGISTICS SEGMENT REVENUE IN THE THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MARCH 30, 2019.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE INSURANCE SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF SIGNATURE INSURANCE COMPANY, A WHOLLY OWNED OFFSHORE  INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY (\u201cSIGNATURE\u201d), AND RISK MANAGEMENT CLAIM SERVICES, INC. THE INSURANCE SEGMENT PROVIDES RISK AND CLAIMS MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO CERTAIN OF LANDSTAR\u2019S OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, IT REINSURES CERTAIN RISKS  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND PROVIDES CERTAIN PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN OF LANDSTAR\u2019S OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES. REVENUE AT THE INSURANCE SEGMENT REPRESENTS REINSURANCE PREMIUMS FROM THIRD PARTY  INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE INSURANCE PROGRAMS TO BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHERE ALL OR A PORTION OF THE RISK IS ULTIMATELY BORNE BY SIGNATURE. REVENUE AT THE INSURANCE SEGMENT REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 1% OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED  REVENUE FOR THE THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MARCH 30, 2019.  CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY\u2019S SUCCESS PRINCIPALLY DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE FREIGHT REVENUE THROUGH ITS NETWORK OF  INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS AND TO SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY DELIVER FREIGHT UTILIZING THIRD PARTY CAPACITY PROVIDERS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS TO THE COMPANY\u2019S SUCCESS INCLUDE INCREASING REVENUE, SOURCING CAPACITY  AND CONTROLLING COSTS, INCLUDING INSURANCE AND CLAIMS.  WHILE CUSTOMER DEMAND, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ULTIMATELY  DRIVES INCREASES OR DECREASES IN REVENUE, THE COMPANY PRIMARILY RELIES ON ITS INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS TO ESTABLISH CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND GENERATE REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES. MANAGEMENT\u2019S EMPHASIS WITH RESPECT TO REVENUE GROWTH IS ON  REVENUE GENERATED BY INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS WHO ON AN ANNUAL BASIS GENERATE $1 MILLION OR MORE OF LANDSTAR REVENUE (\u201cMILLION DOLLAR AGENTS\u201d). MANAGEMENT BELIEVES FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH IS PRIMARILY DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY  TO INCREASE BOTH THE REVENUE GENERATED BY MILLION DOLLAR AGENTS AND THE NUMBER OF MILLION DOLLAR AGENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF RECRUITING NEW AGENTS, INCREASING THE REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES GENERATED BY EXISTING INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS  AND PROVIDING ITS INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS WITH TECHNOLOGY-BASED TOOLS THEY MAY USE TO GROW REVENUE AND INCREASE EFFICIENCIES AT THEIR BUSINESSES. DURING THE 2018 FISCAL YEAR, 608 INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS GENERATED  $1 MILLION OR MORE OF LANDSTAR REVENUE AND THUS QUALIFIED AS MILLION DOLLAR AGENTS. DURING THE 2018 FISCAL YEAR, THE AVERAGE REVENUE GENERATED BY A MILLION DOLLAR AGENT WAS $7,150,000 AND REVENUE GENERATED BY MILLION DOLLAR AGENTS IN THE  AGGREGATE REPRESENTED 94% OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUE.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT MONITORS BUSINESS ACTIVITY BY TRACKING THE NUMBER OF LOADS (VOLUME) AND REVENUE  PER LOAD BY MODE OF TRANSPORTATION. REVENUE PER LOAD CAN BE INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS OTHER THAN A CHANGE IN PRICE. THOSE FACTORS INCLUDE THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF HAUL, FREIGHT TYPE, SPECIAL HANDLING AND EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS, FUEL COSTS AND DELIVERY  TIME REQUIREMENTS. FOR SHIPMENTS INVOLVING TWO OR MORE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION, REVENUE IS GENERALLY CLASSIFIED BY THE MODE OF TRANSPORTATION HAVING THE HIGHEST COST FOR THE LOAD. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THIS INFORMATION BY TRAILER TYPE FOR  TRUCK TRANSPORTATION AND BY MODE FOR ALL OTHERS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE TRUCK CAPACITY PROVIDERS ON THE DATES INDICATED.  MARCH 30, 2019  MARCH 31, 2018  BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS  9,911  9,243  TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS.

THE COMPANY INCURS COSTS THAT ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE TRANSPORTATION OF FREIGHT THAT INCLUDE  PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION AND COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS. THE COMPANY INCURS INDIRECT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSPORTATION OF FREIGHT THAT INCLUDE OTHER OPERATING COSTS AND INSURANCE AND CLAIMS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY INCURS SELLING, GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ESSENTIAL TO ADMINISTERING ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS. MANAGEMENT CONTINUALLY MONITORS ALL COMPONENTS OF THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY AND ESTABLISHES ANNUAL COST BUDGETS WHICH, IN GENERAL, ARE USED TO BENCHMARK COSTS INCURRED  ON A MONTHLY BASIS.  PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT A BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR OR OTHER THIRD PARTY CAPACITY PROVIDER IS  PAID TO HAUL FREIGHT. THE AMOUNT OF PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION PAID TO A BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR IS PRIMARILY BASED ON A CONTRACTUALLY AGREED-UPON PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE GENERATED BY LOADS HAULED BY THE BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. PURCHASED  TRANSPORTATION PAID TO A TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIER IS BASED ON EITHER A NEGOTIATED RATE FOR EACH LOAD HAULED OR, TO A LESSER EXTENT, A CONTRACTUALLY AGREED-UPON FIXED RATE PER LOAD. PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION PAID TO RAILROADS IS BASED ON EITHER A  NEGOTIATED RATE FOR EACH LOAD HAULED OR A CONTRACTUALLY AGREED-UPON FIXED RATE PER LOAD. PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION PAID TO AIR CARGO CARRIERS IS GENERALLY BASED ON A NEGOTIATED RATE FOR EACH LOAD HAULED AND PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION PAID TO OCEAN  CARGO CARRIERS IS GENERALLY BASED ON CONTRACTUALLY AGREED-UPON FIXED RATES. PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE FOR TRUCK BROKERAGE, RAIL INTERMODAL AND OCEAN CARGO SERVICES IS NORMALLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR  AND AIR CARGO SERVICES. PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION IS THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF COSTS AND EXPENSES AND, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, INCREASES OR DECREASES AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUE IN PROPORTION TO CHANGES IN THE PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED  REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTY CAPACITY PROVIDERS AND EXTERNAL REVENUE FROM THE INSURANCE SEGMENT, CONSISTING OF REINSURANCE PREMIUMS. PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION AS A PERCENT OF REVENUE ALSO INCREASES OR  DECREASES IN RELATION TO THE AVAILABILITY OF TRUCK BROKERAGE CAPACITY AND WITH CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF FUEL ON REVENUE GENERATED BY TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS. THE COMPANY PASSES 100% OF FUEL SURCHARGES BILLED TO CUSTOMERS FOR FREIGHT HAULED BY BCO  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO ITS BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THESE FUEL SURCHARGES ARE EXCLUDED FROM REVENUE AND THE COST OF PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION. PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE TRANSIT PERIOD AS THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION  TO THE CUSTOMER IS COMPLETED.  COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUALLY AGREED-UPON PERCENTAGES OF REVENUE OR NET REVENUE, DEFINED  AS REVENUE LESS THE COST OF PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION, OR NET REVENUE LESS A CONTRACTUALLY AGREED UPON PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE RETAINED BY LANDSTAR. COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUE WILL VARY DIRECTLY WITH FLUCTUATIONS IN  THE PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUE GENERATED BY THE VARIOUS MODES OF TRANSPORTATION AND REINSURANCE PREMIUMS AND WITH CHANGES IN NET REVENUE MARGIN, DEFINED AS NET REVENUE DIVIDED BY REVENUE, ON SERVICES PROVIDED BY TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS,  RAILROADS, AIR CARGO CARRIERS AND OCEAN CARGO CARRIERS. COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE FREIGHT TRANSIT PERIOD AS THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION TO THE CUSTOMER IS COMPLETED.  THE COMPANY DEFINES GROSS PROFIT AS REVENUE LESS THE COST OF PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION AND COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS. GROSS PROFIT DIVIDED BY  REVENUE IS REFERRED TO AS GROSS PROFIT MARGIN. THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING MARGIN IS DEFINED AS OPERATING INCOME DIVIDED BY GROSS PROFIT.  IN GENERAL, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN ON REVENUE GENERATED BY BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS REPRESENTS A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE DUE TO THE NATURE  OF THE CONTRACTS THAT PAY A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE TO BOTH THE BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS. FOR REVENUE GENERATED BY TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN IS EITHER FIXED OR VARIABLE AS A PERCENT  OF REVENUE, DEPENDING ON THE CONTRACT WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENT. UNDER CERTAIN CONTRACTS WITH INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS, THE COMPANY RETAINS A FIXED PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE AND THE AGENT RETAINS THE AMOUNT  REMAINING LESS THE COST OF PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION (THE \u201cRETENTION CONTRACTS\u201d). GROSS PROFIT MARGIN ON REVENUE GENERATED BY RAILROADS, AIR CARGO CARRIERS, OCEAN CARGO CARRIERS AND TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS, OTHER THAN THOSE UNDER RETENTION  CONTRACTS, IS VARIABLE IN NATURE AS THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTRACTS WITH INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS PROVIDE COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS AT A CONTRACTUALLY AGREED UPON PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE FOR THESE TYPES OF LOADS. APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE  COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED REVENUE IN THE THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MARCH 30, 2019 WAS GENERATED UNDER CONTRACTS THAT HAVE A FIXED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN WHILE 50% WAS UNDER CONTRACTS THAT HAVE A VARIABLE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MAINTENANCE COSTS FOR COMPANY-PROVIDED TRAILING EQUIPMENT AND BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR  RECRUITING AND QUALIFICATION COSTS ARE THE LARGEST COMPONENTS OF OTHER OPERATING COSTS. ALSO INCLUDED IN OTHER OPERATING COSTS ARE TRAILER RENTAL COSTS, THE PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ADVANCES AND OTHER RECEIVABLES DUE FROM BCO INDEPENDENT  CONTRACTORS AND INDEPENDENT COMMISSION SALES AGENTS AND GAINS/LOSSES, IF ANY, ON SALES OF COMPANY-OWNED TRAILING EQUIPMENT.  WITH RESPECT  TO INSURANCE AND CLAIMS COST, POTENTIAL LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH ACCIDENTS IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY IS SEVERE AND OCCURRENCES ARE UNPREDICTABLE. FOR COMMERCIAL TRUCKING CLAIMS, LANDSTAR RETAINS LIABILITY UP TO $5,000,000 PER OCCURRENCE. IN  ADDITION, FOR COMMERCIAL TRUCKING CLAIMS EXCEEDING ITS $5,000,000 PER OCCURRENCE SELF-INSURED RETENTION, THE COMPANY RETAINS LIABILITY UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $700,000 IN THE AGGREGATE ON ANY CLAIMS INCURRED ON OR AFTER MAY 1, 2016 THROUGH  APRIL 30, 2017, UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $500,000 IN THE AGGREGATE ON ANY CLAIMS INCURRED ON OR AFTER MAY 1, 2017 THROUGH APRIL 30, 2018 AND UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $350,000 IN THE AGGREGATE ON ANY CLAIMS INCURRED ON OR AFTER MAY 1, 2018  THROUGH APRIL 30, 2019. THE COMPANY ALSO RETAINS LIABILITY OF UP TO $1,000,000 FOR EACH GENERAL LIABILITY CLAIM, UP TO $250,000 FOR EACH WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION CLAIM AND UP TO $250,000 FOR EACH CARGO CLAIM. IN ADDITION, UNDER REINSURANCE  ARRANGEMENTS BY SIGNATURE OF CERTAIN RISKS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, THE COMPANY RETAINS LIABILITY OF UP TO $500,000, $1,000,000 OR $2,000,000 WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENT CLAIMS AND UP TO $750,000 WITH  RESPECT TO CERTAIN WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION CLAIMS. THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPOSURE TO LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH ACCIDENTS INCURRED BY TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS, RAILROADS AND AIR AND OCEAN CARGO CARRIERS WHO TRANSPORT FREIGHT ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY  IS REDUCED BY VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH SUCH CARRIERS MAINTAIN THEIR OWN INSURANCE COVERAGE. A MATERIAL INCREASE IN THE FREQUENCY OR SEVERITY OF ACCIDENTS, CARGO CLAIMS OR WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION CLAIMS OR THE MATERIAL  UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT OF EXISTING CLAIMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON LANDSTAR\u2019S COST OF INSURANCE AND CLAIMS AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  DURING THE THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MARCH 30, 2019, EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY SIXTY-SEVEN PERCENT  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION PRIMARILY RELATE TO DEPRECIATION OF  TRAILING EQUIPMENT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE PERCENTAGE RELATIONSHIP OF  PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION AND COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS, BOTH BEING DIRECT COSTS, TO REVENUE AND INDIRECT COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS PROFIT FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 30,  2019  MARCH 31,  2018  REVENUE  100.0%  100.0%  PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION  76.6  77.3  COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS  8.3  7.8  GROSS PROFIT MARGIN  15.1%  14.8%  GROSS PROFIT  100.0%  100.0%  INVESTMENT INCOME  0.7  0.6  INDIRECT COSTS AND EXPENSES.  OTHER OPERATING COSTS, NET OF GAINS ON ASSET SALES/DISPOSITIONS  5.3  4.9  INSURANCE AND CLAIMS  9.6  11.2  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  26.5  29.1  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  7.3  7.1  TOTAL COSTS AND EXPENSES  48.7  52.2  OPERATING MARGIN  52.0%  48.3%  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A DISCUSSION OF INDIRECT COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS PROFIT IS  USEFUL AND MEANINGFUL TO POTENTIAL INVESTORS FOR THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPAL REASONS: (1) DISCLOSURE OF THESE RELATIVE MEASURES (I.E., EACH INDIRECT OPERATING COST LINE ITEM AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS PROFIT) ALLOWS INVESTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE  UNDERLYING TRENDS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS; (2) DUE TO THE GENERALLY FIXED NATURE OF THESE INDIRECT COSTS (OTHER THAN INSURANCE AND CLAIMS COSTS), THESE RELATIVE MEASURES ARE MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS\u2019 EVALUATIONS OF THE  COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT OF ITS INDIRECT COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OPERATIONS; (3) MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THIS FINANCIAL INFORMATION IN ITS DECISION-MAKING, SUCH AS BUDGETING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE, TRAILING EQUIPMENT AND SELLING, GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS; AND (4) THIS INFORMATION FACILITATES COMPARISONS BY INVESTORS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS TO THE RESULTS OF OTHER  NON-ASSET  OR ASSET-LIGHT COMPANIES IN THE TRANSPORTATION AND  LOGISTICS SERVICES INDUSTRY WHO REPORT \u201cNET REVENUE\u201d IN MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, WHICH REPRESENTS REVENUE LESS THE COST OF PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMPANY\u2019S USE OF THE TERM \u201cGROSS  PROFIT\u201d AND USE OF THE TERM \u201cNET REVENUE\u201d BY OTHER COMPANIES IN THE TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS SERVICES INDUSTRY IS DUE TO THE DIRECT COST OF COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS UNDER THE LANDSTAR BUSINESS MODEL, WHEREAS OTHER COMPANIES IN THIS  INDUSTRY GENERALLY HAVE NO COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS.  ALSO, AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, THE COMPANY REPORTS TWO OPERATING SEGMENTS: THE  TRANSPORTATION LOGISTICS SEGMENT AND THE INSURANCE SEGMENT. EXTERNAL REVENUE AT THE INSURANCE SEGMENT, REPRESENTING REINSURANCE PREMIUMS, HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN RELATIVELY CONSISTENT AT 2% OR LESS OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUE AND GENERALLY CORRESPONDS  DIRECTLY WITH THE NUMBER OF TRUCKS PROVIDED BY BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THE DISCUSSION OF INDIRECT COST LINE ITEMS IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSIDERS THE COMPANY\u2019S COSTS  ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS RATHER THAN ON A SEGMENT BASIS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS PRESENTATION FORMAT IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE TO ASSIST USERS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN UNDERSTANDING THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.  (1) THE INSURANCE SEGMENT HAS NO OTHER OPERATING COSTS; (2) DISCUSSION OF INSURANCE AND CLAIMS AT EITHER SEGMENT WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE OTHER MAY CREATE CONFUSION AMONGST INVESTORS AND POTENTIAL INVESTORS DUE TO INTERCOMPANY ARRANGEMENTS  AND SPECIFIC DEDUCTIBLE PROGRAMS THAT AFFECT COMPARABILITY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS BY SEGMENT BETWEEN VARIOUS FISCAL PERIODS BUT THAT HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE COMPANY FROM A CONSOLIDATED REPORTING PERSPECTIVE; (3) SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  COSTS OF THE INSURANCE SEGMENT COMPRISE LESS THAN 10% OF CONSOLIDATED SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN RELATIVELY CONSISTENT ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS; AND (4) THE INSURANCE SEGMENT HAS NO DEPRECIATION AND  AMORTIZATION.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  REVENUE FOR THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD WAS $1,033,000,000, A DECREASE OF $14,926,000, OR 1%, COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD.  TRANSPORTATION REVENUE DECREASED $16,679,000, OR 2%. THE DECREASE IN TRANSPORTATION REVENUE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASED REVENUE PER LOAD OF APPROXIMATELY 4%, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASED NUMBER OF LOADS HAULED OF APPROXIMATELY 2%. REINSURANCE  PREMIUMS WERE $14,039,000 AND $12,286,000 FOR THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM REINSURANCE PREMIUMS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF TRUCKS PROVIDED BY BCO  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD.  TRUCK TRANSPORTATION REVENUE  GENERATED BY BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS (TOGETHER, THE \u201cTHIRD PARTY TRUCK CAPACITY PROVIDERS\u201d) FOR THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD WAS $953,111,000, REPRESENTING 92% OF TOTAL REVENUE, A DECREASE OF $25,977,000,  OR 3%, COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD. REVENUE PER LOAD ON LOADS HAULED BY THIRD PARTY TRUCK CAPACITY PROVIDERS DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 5% IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD, WHILE THE NUMBER OF  LOADS HAULED BY THIRD PARTY TRUCK CAPACITY PROVIDERS INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 2% COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD. THE DECREASE IN REVENUE PER LOAD ON LOADS HAULED VIA TRUCK WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A SOFTER FREIGHT ENVIRONMENT EXPERIENCED  DURING THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD, WHICH RESULTED IN MORE READILY AVAILABLE TRUCK CAPACITY AS COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD. REVENUE PER LOAD ON LOADS HAULED VIA VAN EQUIPMENT DECREASED 7%, REVENUE PER LOAD ON LOADS HAULED VIA  UNSIDED/PLATFORM EQUIPMENT DECREASED 1% AND REVENUE PER LOAD ON LESS-THAN-TRUCKLOAD LOADINGS DECREASED 6% AS COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LOADS HAULED VIA TRUCK COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD  WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S UNSIDED/PLATFORM SERVICES AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER DEMAND FOR TRUCKLOAD SERVICES PROVIDED VIA VAN EQUIPMENT. THE NUMBER OF LOADS HAULED VIA UNSIDED/PLATFORM AND VAN EQUIPMENT INCREASED 4% AND 1%  DURING THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD. FUEL SURCHARGES BILLED TO CUSTOMERS ON REVENUE GENERATED BY BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE EXCLUDED FROM REVENUE. FUEL SURCHARGES ON TRUCK BROKERAGE  CARRIER REVENUE IDENTIFIED SEPARATELY IN BILLINGS TO CUSTOMERS AND INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIER REVENUE WERE $20,987,000 AND $22,245,000 IN THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT BILLINGS  TO MANY CUSTOMERS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TRUCK BROKERAGE SERVICES INCLUDE A SINGLE  ALL-IN  RATE THAT DOES NOT SEPARATELY IDENTIFY FUEL SURCHARGES ON LOADS HAULED VIA TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE  OVERALL IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FUEL PRICES ON REVENUE AND REVENUE PER LOAD ON LOADS HAULED VIA TRUCK IS LIKELY TO BE GREATER THAN THAT INDICATED.  TRANSPORTATION REVENUE GENERATED BY RAIL INTERMODAL, AIR CARGO AND OCEAN CARGO CARRIERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cMULTIMODE CAPACITY  PROVIDERS\u201d) FOR THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD WAS $60,684,000, OR 6% OF TOTAL REVENUE, AN INCREASE OF $7,915,000, OR 15%, COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD. REVENUE PER LOAD ON REVENUE GENERATED BY MULTIMODE CAPACITY PROVIDERS INCREASED  APPROXIMATELY 13% IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD, AND THE NUMBER OF LOADS HAULED BY MULTIMODE CAPACITY  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PROVIDERS INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 2% OVER THE SAME PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE PER LOAD OF 13% ON LOADS HAULED BY MULTIMODE CAPACITY PROVIDERS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED REVENUE  PER LOAD ON OCEAN LOADS. THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LOADS HAULED BY MULTIMODE CAPACITY PROVIDERS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A 34% INCREASE IN AIR LOADINGS, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED AIR LOADINGS FOR ONE SPECIFIC CUSTOMER. ALSO, REVENUE PER  LOAD ON REVENUE GENERATED BY MULTIMODE CAPACITY PROVIDERS IS INFLUENCED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING REVENUE MIX AMONG THE VARIOUS MODES OF TRANSPORTATION USED, LENGTH OF HAUL, COMPLEXITY OF FREIGHT, DENSITY OF FREIGHT LANES, FUEL COSTS AND  AVAILABILITY OF CAPACITY.  PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION WAS 76.6% AND 77.3% OF REVENUE IN THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS,  RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASED RATE OF PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION PAID ON TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIER REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE  CONTRIBUTED BY BCO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, WHICH TYPICALLY HAS A LOWER RATE OF PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION THAN REVENUE GENERATED BY TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS. COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS WERE 8.3% AND 7.8% OF REVENUE IN THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK  PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN COMMISSIONS TO AGENTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASED NET REVENUE MARGIN ON REVENUE GENERATED BY TRUCK BROKERAGE CARRIERS.  INVESTMENT INCOME WAS $1,138,000 AND $861,000 IN THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME WAS  ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER AVERAGE RATES OF RETURN ON INVESTMENTS IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD.  OTHER OPERATING COSTS INCREASED $635,000  IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD AND REPRESENTED 5.3% OF GROSS PROFIT IN THE 2019 PERIOD COMPARED TO 4.9% OF GROSS PROFIT IN THE 2018 PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN OTHER OPERATING COSTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED TRAILING EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE COSTS AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASED NUMBER OF COMPANY-OWNED TRAILERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASED PROVISION FOR CONTRACTOR BAD DEBT. THE INCREASE IN OTHER OPERATING COSTS AS A  PERCENTAGE OF GROSS PROFIT WAS CAUSED BY THE INCREASE IN OTHER OPERATING COSTS.  INSURANCE AND CLAIMS DECREASED $2,367,000 IN THE 2019  THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD AND REPRESENTED 9.6% OF GROSS PROFIT IN THE 2019 PERIOD COMPARED TO 11.2% OF GROSS PROFIT IN THE 2018 PERIOD. THE DECREASE IN INSURANCE AND CLAIMS EXPENSE COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR WAS  PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED NET UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT OF PRIOR YEARS\u2019 CLAIMS AND DECREASED SEVERITY OF CURRENT YEAR CLAIMS IN THE 2019 PERIOD. NET UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT OF PRIOR YEARS\u2019 CLAIMS WAS $1,407,000 AND $2,558,000 IN THE 2019  AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN INSURANCE AND CLAIMS AS A PERCENT OF GROSS PROFIT WAS CAUSED BY THE DECREASE IN INSURANCE AND CLAIMS COSTS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS DECREASED $3,983,000 IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD AND  REPRESENTED 26.5% OF GROSS PROFIT IN THE 2019 PERIOD COMPARED TO 29.1% OF GROSS PROFIT IN THE 2018 PERIOD. THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASED PROVISION FOR INCENTIVE  COMPENSATION AND DECREASED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED WAGES AND AN INCREASED PROVISION FOR CUSTOMER BAD DEBT. INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $1,038,000  AND $4,131,000 FOR THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $1,938,000 AND $3,710,000 FOR THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS A PERCENT OF GROSS PROFIT WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED $319,000 IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD AND REPRESENTED  7.3% OF GROSS PROFIT IN THE 2019 PERIOD COMPARED TO 7.1% OF GROSS PROFIT IN THE 2018 PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASED NUMBER OF COMPANY-OWNED TRAILERS. THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND  AMORTIZATION AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS PROFIT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASED DEPRECIATION COSTS.  INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE IN THE 2019  THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD INCREASED $5,000 COMPARED TO THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD.  THE PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE 2019 AND 2018  THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS WERE BASED ON ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES OF 24.2% AND 24.5%, RESPECTIVELY, ADJUSTED FOR DISCRETE EVENTS, SUCH AS BENEFITS RESULTING FROM STOCK-BASED AWARDS. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE 2019  THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD WAS 21.0%, WHICH APPROXIMATED THE STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD WAS 22.7%, WHICH WAS HIGHER THAN THE STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY  ATTRIBUTABLE TO STATE TAXES, THE TAX REFORM ACT\u2019S ELIMINATION OF THE PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION EXCEPTION UNDER SECTION 162(M) AND THE MEALS AND ENTERTAINMENT EXCLUSION. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD OF  21.0% WAS LOWER THAN THE 24.2% ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED ON STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD, WHICH ESSENTIALLY OFFSET THE IMPACT OF STATE TAXES  AND THE MEALS AND ENTERTAINMENT EXCLUSION. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD OF 22.7% WAS LOWER THAN THE 24.5% ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED ON STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS IN THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST OF $17,000 AND $44,000 IN THE 2019 AND  2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTS THE FORMER NONCONTROLLING INVESTORS\u2019 SHARE OF THE NET LOSS INCURRED BY LANDSTAR METRO AND LANDSTAR SERVICIOS.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY WAS $63,317,000, OR $1.58 PER COMMON SHARE ($1.58 PER DILUTED SHARE), IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY WAS $57,517,000, OR $1.37 PER COMMON SHARE ($1.37 PER DILUTED SHARE), IN THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD.  CAPITAL  RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  WORKING CAPITAL AND THE RATIO OF CURRENT ASSETS TO CURRENT LIABILITIES WERE $470,951,000 AND 2.0 TO 1,  RESPECTIVELY, AT MARCH 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH $435,611,000 AND 1.8 TO 1, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 29, 2018. LANDSTAR HAS HISTORICALLY OPERATED WITH CURRENT RATIOS WITHIN THE RANGE OF 1.5 TO 1 TO 2.0 TO 1. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING  ACTIVITIES WAS $121,416,000 IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD COMPARED WITH $72,002,000 IN THE 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TIMING OF COLLECTIONS OF TRADE  RECEIVABLES.  THE COMPANY DECLARED AND PAID $0.165 PER SHARE, OR $6,629,000 IN THE AGGREGATE, IN CASH DIVIDENDS DURING THE THIRTEEN-WEEK  PERIOD ENDED MARCH 30, 2019. THE COMPANY DECLARED AND PAID $0.15 PER SHARE, OR $6,308,000 IN THE AGGREGATE, IN CASH DIVIDENDS DURING THE THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND, DURING SUCH PERIOD, ALSO PAID $62,985,000 OF DIVIDENDS  PAYABLE WHICH WERE DECLARED DURING FISCAL YEAR 2017 AND INCLUDED IN CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT DECEMBER 30, 2017. DURING THE THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MARCH 30, 2019, THE COMPANY PURCHASED 124,481 SHARES OF  ITS COMMON STOCK AT A TOTAL COST OF $12,977,000. DURING THE THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, THE COMPANY PURCHASED 14,354 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT A TOTAL COST OF $1,508,000. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, THE COMPANY MAY PURCHASE IN  THE AGGREGATE UP TO 1,875,519 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER ITS AUTHORIZED STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAMS. LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING CURRENT MATURITIES, WAS $116,430,000 AT MARCH 30, 2019, $11,995,000 LOWER THAN AT DECEMBER 29, 2018.  EQUITY WAS $728,260,000, OR 86% OF TOTAL CAPITALIZATION (DEFINED AS LONG-TERM DEBT INCLUDING CURRENT MATURITIES PLUS EQUITY), AT  MARCH 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $689,133,000, OR 84% OF TOTAL CAPITALIZATION, AT DECEMBER 29, 2018. THE INCREASE IN EQUITY WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF NET INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PURCHASES OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK AND  DIVIDENDS DECLARED BY THE COMPANY IN THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD.  ON JUNE 2, 2016, LANDSTAR ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A  SYNDICATE OF BANKS AND JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d). THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH MATURES ON JUNE 2, 2021, PROVIDES $250,000,000 OF BORROWING CAPACITY IN THE FORM OF A REVOLVING CREDIT  FACILITY, $50,000,000 OF WHICH MAY BE UTILIZED IN THE FORM OF LETTER OF CREDIT GUARANTEES. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES AN \u201cACCORDION\u201d FEATURE PROVIDING FOR A POSSIBLE INCREASE UP TO AN AGGREGATE BORROWING AMOUNT OF $400,000,000. THE  COMPANY\u2019S PRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED ON JUNE 2, 2016.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT  LIMIT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE INCURRENCE OF ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAINTAIN A MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND MAINTAIN A LEVERAGE RATIO, AS DEFINED IN  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, BELOW A SPECIFIED MAXIMUM. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR A RESTRICTION ON CASH DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CAPITAL STOCK TO THE EXTENT THERE IS A DEFAULT UNDER THE CREDIT  AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF SUCH CASH DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS TO THE EXTENT THAT, AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO ANY PAYMENT MADE TO EFFECT SUCH CASH DIVIDEND OR  OTHER DISTRIBUTION, THE LEVERAGE RATIO WOULD EXCEED 2.5 TO 1 ON A PRO FORMA BASIS AS OF THE END OF THE COMPANY\u2019S MOST RECENTLY COMPLETED FISCAL QUARTER. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR AN EVENT OF DEFAULT IN THE EVENT THAT, AMONG OTHER  THINGS, A PERSON OR GROUP ACQUIRES 35% OR MORE OF THE OUTSTANDING CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY OR OBTAINS POWER TO ELECT A MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S DIRECTORS OR THE DIRECTORS CEASE TO CONSIST OF A MAJORITY OF CONTINUING DIRECTORS, AS DEFINED  IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NONE OF THESE COVENANTS ARE PRESENTLY CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE MATERIALLY RESTRICTIVE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS, CAPITAL RESOURCES OR LIQUIDITY. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE DEBT  COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  AT MARCH 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AND $34,369,000 OF LETTERS OF  CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. AT MARCH 30, 2019, THERE WAS $215,631,000 AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS $62,345,000 IN LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING AS COLLATERAL FOR  INSURANCE CLAIMS THAT ARE SECURED BY INVESTMENTS TOTALING $69,272,000 AT MARCH 30, 2019. INVESTMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDE PRIMARILY INVESTMENT-GRADE BONDS HAVING MATURITIES OF UP TO FIVE YEARS. FAIR VALUE OF  INVESTMENTS IS BASED PRIMARILY ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES. SEE \u201cNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u201d INCLUDED HEREIN FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE OF INVESTMENTS.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS GENERATED SUFFICIENT OPERATING CASH FLOW TO MEET ITS DEBT  SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, FUND CONTINUED GROWTH, BOTH ORGANIC AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, COMPLETE OR EXECUTE SHARE PURCHASES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER AUTHORIZED SHARE PURCHASE PROGRAMS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND MEET WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS. AS AN ASSET-LIGHT  PROVIDER OF INTEGRATED TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OPERATING PROPERTY ARE GENERALLY FOR TRAILING EQUIPMENT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. IN ADDITION, A SIGNIFICANT  PORTION OF THE TRAILING EQUIPMENT USED BY THE COMPANY IS PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTY CAPACITY PROVIDERS, THEREBY REDUCING THE COMPANY\u2019S CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. DURING THE 2019 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD, THE COMPANY PURCHASED $4,576,000 OF OPERATING  PROPERTY. LANDSTAR ANTICIPATES ACQUIRING EITHER BY PURCHASE OR LEASE FINANCING DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 APPROXIMATELY $66,000,000 IN OPERATING PROPERTY, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF NEW TRAILING EQUIPMENT TO REPLACE OLDER TRAILING  EQUIPMENT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT.  ON JANUARY 29, 2019, LANDSTAR ACQUIRED ALL OF THE REMAINING EQUITY INTERESTS IN  LANDSTAR METRO AND LANDSTAR SERVICIOS THEN HELD BY THE MINORITY EQUITYHOLDERS. ACCORDINGLY, AS OF SUCH DATE, LANDSTAR METRO AND LANDSTAR SERVICIOS EACH BECAME WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY. CASH CONSIDERATION PAID IN THE 2019 FIRST  QUARTER TO PURCHASE THESE REMAINING EQUITY INTERESTS WAS $600,000.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS COMBINED WITH THE  COMPANY\u2019S BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET LANDSTAR\u2019S DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, FUND CONTINUED GROWTH, BOTH INTERNAL AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, PAY DIVIDENDS, COMPLETE THE AUTHORIZED SHARE PURCHASE  PROGRAM AND MEET WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS.  LEGAL MATTERS  REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE DESCRIPTIONS OF CERTAIN PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018. THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS DURING THE THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MARCH 30, 2019.  THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED IN CERTAIN CLAIMS AND PENDING LITIGATION ARISING FROM THE NORMAL CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. MANY OF THESE CLAIMS ARE COVERED  IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY INSURANCE. BASED ON KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, OPINIONS OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADEQUATE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR PROBABLE LOSSES WITH RESPECT TO THE RESOLUTION OF ALL SUCH CLAIMS  AND PENDING LITIGATION AND THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME, AFTER PROVISIONS THEREFOR, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY, BUT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A GIVEN QUARTER OR  YEAR.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  LANDSTAR PROVIDES FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF SELF-INSURED CLAIMS PRIMARILY ON AN ACTUARIAL BASIS. THE AMOUNT RECORDED FOR THE ESTIMATED  LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS INCURRED IS BASED UPON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN ON THE APPLICABLE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS MAY BE FOR AN AMOUNT GREATER OR LESS THAN THE AMOUNT ESTIMATED BY MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANY  CONTINUALLY REVISES ITS EXISTING CLAIM ESTIMATES AS NEW OR REVISED INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE ON THE STATUS OF EACH CLAIM. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED BOTH FAVORABLE AND UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT OF PRIOR YEARS\u2019 CLAIMS ESTIMATES.  DURING THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRTEEN-WEEK PERIODS, INSURANCE AND CLAIMS COSTS INCLUDED $1,407,000 AND $2,558,000 OF NET UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS TO PRIOR YEARS\u2019 CLAIMS ESTIMATES, RESPECTIVELY. IT IS REASONABLY LIKELY THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF  SETTLING ALL OUTSTANDING CLAIMS WILL BE MORE OR LESS THAN THE ESTIMATED CLAIMS RESERVE AT MARCH 30, 2019.  SIGNIFICANT VARIANCES FROM  MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATES FOR THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF SELF-INSURED CLAIMS COULD BE EXPECTED TO POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AFFECT LANDSTAR\u2019S EARNINGS IN A GIVEN QUARTER OR YEAR. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF  THESE ITEMS, GIVEN A RANGE OF REASONABLY LIKELY OUTCOMES, WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE LONG-TERM FINANCIAL CONDITION OF LANDSTAR OR ITS ABILITY TO FUND ITS CONTINUING OPERATIONS.  EFFECTS OF INFLATION  MANAGEMENT DOES NOT  BELIEVE INFLATION HAS HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION OF LANDSTAR IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. HOWEVER, INFLATION IN EXCESS OF HISTORIC TRENDS MIGHT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SEASONALITY  LANDSTAR\u2019S OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL TRENDS COMMON TO THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY.

WE GENERALLY RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOLLOWING A SINGLE, PRINCIPLES-BASED FIVE-STEP MODEL TO BE APPLIED TO ALL CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS AND GENERALLY PROVIDES FOR THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED, NET OF ALLOWANCES FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS, DISCOUNTS OR SALES INCENTIVES, AS WELL AS TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS THAT ARE REMITTED TO GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES, WHEN CONTROL OVER THE PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUE RELATED TO EQUIPMENT SUPPLIED UNDER SALES-TYPE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED ONCE CONTROL OVER THE EQUIPMENT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER, WHILE REVENUE RELATED TO EQUIPMENT SUPPLIED UNDER OPERATING-TYPE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE.  WHILE THE MAJORITY OF OUR SALES TRANSACTIONS CONTAIN STANDARD BUSINESS TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THERE ARE SOME TRANSACTIONS THAT CONTAIN NON-STANDARD BUSINESS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. AS A RESULT, CONTRACT INTERPRETATION AND ANALYSIS IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING, INCLUDING: (I) THE AMOUNT OF THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION, INCLUDING VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, (II) WHETHER THE ARRANGEMENT CONTAINS AN EMBEDDED LEASE, AND IF SO, WHETHER SUCH EMBEDDED LEASE IS A SALES-TYPE LEASE OR AN OPERATING LEASE, (III) HOW THE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION WHEN MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS EXIST, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION OF STANDALONE SELLING PRICE, (IV) WHEN TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, AND (V) WHETHER UNCOMPLETED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE COMPLETED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. CHANGES IN JUDGMENTS ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.  WE ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS TO SELL OUR MONITORING SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES, SOMETIMES AS PART OF ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT INCLUDE VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF PRODUCT SALES, EQUIPMENT LEASES AND SERVICES. IN THE CASE OF CONTRACTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, THE AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE PROVIDES THAT THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION BE ALLOCATED TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION ON THE BASIS OF RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICES. WHEN A STANDALONE SELLING PRICE IS NOT READILY OBSERVABLE, WE ESTIMATE THE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE BY CONSIDERING MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHIES, TYPE OF CUSTOMER, CONTRACTUAL PRICES PURSUANT TO GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATION (GPO) CONTRACTS, OUR PRICING AND DISCOUNT PRACTICES, AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS.  SALES UNDER DEFERRED EQUIPMENT AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED SUCH THAT WE AGREE TO PROVIDE CERTAIN MONITORING-RELATED EQUIPMENT, SOFTWARE, INSTALLATION, TRAINING AND/OR WARRANTY SUPPORT AT NO UP-FRONT CHARGE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE HOSPITAL\u2019S AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE SENSORS OVER THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT, WHICH GENERALLY RANGES FROM THREE TO SIX YEARS. WE ALLOCATE CONTRACT CONSIDERATION UNDER DEFERRED EQUIPMENT AGREEMENTS CONTAINING FIXED ANNUAL SENSOR PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TO THE UNDERLYING LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS AT CONTRACT INCEPTION. IN DETERMINING WHETHER ANY UNDERLYING LEASE COMPONENTS ARE RELATED TO A SALES-TYPE LEASE OR AN OPERATING LEASE, WE EVALUATE THE CUSTOMER\u2019S RIGHTS AND ABILITY TO CONTROL THE USE OF THE UNDERLYING EQUIPMENT THROUGHOUT THE CONTRACT TERM, INCLUDING ANY EQUIPMENT SUBSTITUTION RIGHTS RETAINED BY US, AS WELL AS OUR EXPECTATIONS SURROUNDING POTENTIAL CONTRACT/LEASE EXTENSIONS OR RENEWALS AND THE CUSTOMER\u2019S EXERCISE OF ANY PURCHASE OPTIONS. REVENUE ALLOCABLE TO NON-LEASE COMPONENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS SUCH NON-LEASE COMPONENTS ARE SATISFIED. REVENUE ALLOCABLE TO LEASE COMPONENTS UNDER SALES-TYPE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THE LEASE COMMENCES. REVENUE ALLOCABLE TO LEASE COMPONENTS UNDER OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE OPERATING LEASE. WE GENERALLY DO NOT EXPECT TO DERIVE ANY SIGNIFICANT VALUE IN EXCESS OF SUCH ASSET\u2019S UNAMORTIZED BOOK VALUE FROM EQUIPMENT UNDERLYING OUR OPERATING LEASES ARRANGEMENTS.  REVENUE FROM DIRECT SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS TO END-USER HOSPITALS, EMERGENCY MEDICAL RESPONSE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER DIRECT CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS TO DISTRIBUTORS, IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED EITHER AT THE TIME OF DELIVERY OR AT SHIPMENT, BASED UPON THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT OR UNDERLYING PURCHASE ORDER.  SALES OF INTEGRATED CIRCUIT BOARDS AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO OUR OEMS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT. REVENUE RELATED TO OEM RAINBOW  \u00ae  PARAMETER SOFTWARE LICENSES IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT OF THE OEM\u2019S PRODUCT TO ITS CUSTOMERS, AS REPORTED TO US BY THE OEM.  WE PROVIDE CERTAIN CUSTOMERS WITH VARIOUS SALES INCENTIVES THAT MAY TAKE THE FORM OF DISCOUNTS OR REBATES. WE ESTIMATE AND PROVIDE ALLOWANCES FOR THESE PROGRAMS AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE AT THE TIME OF SALE. IN GENERAL, CUSTOMERS DO NOT HAVE A RIGHT OF RETURN FOR CREDIT OR REFUND. HOWEVER, WE ALLOW RETURNS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD, WE ESTIMATE AND ACCRUE FOR THESE RETURNS AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE. WE ESTIMATE THE REVENUE CONSTRAINTS RELATED TO THESE FORMS OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING EXPECTED PURCHASING VOLUMES, PRIOR SALES AND RETURNS HISTORY, AND SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND LIMITATIONS.  LESSEE ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES  WE DETERMINE IF AN ARRANGEMENT CONTAINS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. ROU ASSETS REPRESENT OUR RIGHT TO USE AN ASSET UNDERLYING AN OPERATING LEASE FOR THE LEASE TERM AND LEASE LIABILITIES REPRESENT OUR OBLIGATION TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS ARISING FROM AN OPERATING LEASE. ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. WE GENERALLY ESTIMATE THE APPLICABLE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO DETERMINE THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION AT THE LEASE COMMENCEMENT DATE. MANY OF OUR LESSEE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE OPTIONS TO EXTEND THE LEASE, WHICH WE DO NOT INCLUDE IN OUR LEASE TERMS UNLESS THEY ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO BE EXERCISED. WE UTILIZE A PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ROU ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN EQUIPMENT LEASES. WE HAVE ALSO MADE A POLICY ELECTION NOT TO SEPARATE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS FOR OUR REAL ESTATE LEASES AND TO EXCLUDE SHORT-TERM LEASES WITH A  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TERM OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS FROM OUR ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES. RENTAL EXPENSE FOR LEASE PAYMENTS RELATED TO OPERATING LEASES IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO ANY OF OUR OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  .

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS TOGETHER WITH OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10\u2010Q AND OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10\u2010K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 (THE \u201cANNUAL REPORT\u201d).  THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. AS A RESULT OF MANY FACTORS, SUCH AS THOSE DESCRIBED UNDER \u201cCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,\u201d \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF NOVEL THERAPEUTICS TO TREAT PROGRESSIVE NON-VIRAL LIVER DISEASES WITH HIGH UNMET MEDICAL NEED UTILIZING OUR PROPRIETARY BILE ACID CHEMISTRY. OUR FIRST MARKETED PRODUCT, OCALIVA  \u00ae  (OBETICHOLIC ACID OR \u201cOCA\u201d), IS AN FARNESOID X RECEPTOR (\u201cFXR\u201d) AGONIST APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES, THE EUROPEAN UNION AND SEVERAL OTHER JURISDICTIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF PRIMARY BILIARY CHOLANGITIS (\u201cPBC\u201d) IN COMBINATION WITH URSODEOXYCHOLIC ACID (\u201cUDCA\u201d) IN ADULTS WITH AN INADEQUATE RESPONSE TO UDCA OR AS MONOTHERAPY IN ADULTS UNABLE TO TOLERATE UDCA. IN ADDITION TO COMMERCIALIZING OCA FOR PBC UNDER THE OCALIVA BRAND NAME, WE ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING OCA FOR MULTIPLE INDICATIONS, INCLUDING NONALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS (\u201cNASH\u201d). WE ARE ALSO DEVELOPING SEVERAL OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES IN VARIOUS STAGES OF CLINICAL AND PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT OCA AND OUR OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO TREAT ORPHAN AND OTHER MORE PREVALENT LIVER DISEASES SUCH AS NASH FOR WHICH THERE ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS.  OCALIVA WAS APPROVED FOR PBC BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) IN MAY 2016 UNDER THE ACCELERATED APPROVAL PATHWAY. WE COMMENCED SALES AND MARKETING OF OCALIVA IN THE UNITED STATES SHORTLY AFTER RECEIVING APPROVAL, AND OCALIVA IS NOW AVAILABLE TO U.S. PATIENTS PRIMARILY THROUGH A NETWORK OF SPECIALTY PHARMACY DISTRIBUTORS. OCALIVA RECEIVED CONDITIONAL APPROVAL FOR PBC FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IN DECEMBER 2016 AND WE COMMENCED OUR EUROPEAN COMMERCIAL LAUNCH IN JANUARY 2017. WE HAVE SUBMITTED DOSSIERS AND OBTAINED, OR ARE OTHERWISE PURSUING, REIMBURSEMENT FROM A NUMBER OF NATIONAL AUTHORITIES IN EUROPE. SINCE JANUARY 2017, OCALIVA HAS ALSO RECEIVED REGULATORY APPROVAL IN SEVERAL OF OUR TARGET MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, INCLUDING CANADA, ISRAEL AND AUSTRALIA, AND WE ARE PURSUING MARKETING APPROVAL OF OCALIVA FOR PBC IN OUR OTHER INTERNATIONAL TARGET MARKETS. OCALIVA RECEIVED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR THE TREATMENT OF PBC.  OUR LEAD PRODUCT CANDIDATE IS OCA FOR THE POTENTIAL TREATMENT OF NASH. IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE ANNOUNCED TOPLINE RESULTS FROM THE PLANNED 18-MONTH INTERIM ANALYSIS OF OUR PIVOTAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL OF OCA IN PATIENTS WITH LIVER FIBROSIS DUE TO NASH, KNOWN AS THE REGENERATE TRIAL. IN THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ANALYSIS, ONCE-DAILY OCA 25 MG MET THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT AGREED WITH THE FDA OF FIBROSIS IMPROVEMENT BY AT LEAST ONE STAGE WITH NO WORSENING OF NASH AT THE PLANNED 18-MONTH INTERIM ANALYSIS AND ADVERSE EVENTS WERE GENERALLY MILD TO MODERATE IN SEVERITY AND THE MOST COMMON WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE KNOWN PROFILE OF OCA. OCA ALSO ACHIEVED THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT IN A PHASE 2B CLINICAL TRIAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF NASH COMPLETED IN LATE JULY 2014, KNOWN AS THE FLINT TRIAL, WHICH WAS SPONSORED BY THE U.S. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES, A PART OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH. OCA HAS RECEIVED BREAKTHROUGH THERAPY DESIGNATION FROM THE FDA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NASH PATIENTS WITH LIVER FIBROSIS. WE CURRENTLY INTEND TO FILE A NEW DRUG APPLICATION (\u201cNDA\u201d) WITH THE FDA IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 SEEKING APPROVAL OF OCA FOR NASH, AND A MARKETING AUTHORIZATION APPLICATION (\u201cMAA\u201d) WITH THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY (\u201cEMA\u201d) FOR OCA FOR NASH IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS EXPANDING OUR OVERALL NASH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WITH ADDITIONAL TRIALS AND STUDIES, INCLUDING OUR ONGOING PHASE 3 TRIAL IN NASH PATIENTS WITH COMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS, KNOWN AS THE REVERSE TRIAL.  AS PART OF OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL OF OCA IN OTHER PROGRESSIVE NON-VIRAL LIVER DISEASES BEYOND PBC AND NASH. WE ALSO INTEND TO STUDY OCA IN COMBINATION WITH BEZAFIBRATE, A PAN-PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR-ACTIVATED RECEPTOR (\u201cPPAR\u201d) AGONIST, IN PATIENTS WITH PBC AND POTENTIALLY OTHER LIVER DISEASES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A PIPELINE OF ADDITIONAL COMPOUNDS IN EARLY STAGES OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  PHASE 3 REGENERATE TRIAL TOPLINE RESULTS  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE ANNOUNCED TOPLINE RESULTS FROM OUR PIVOTAL PHASE 3 CLINICAL TRIAL OF OCA IN PATIENTS WITH LIVER FIBROSIS DUE TO NASH, KNOWN AS THE REGENERATE TRIAL. IN THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ANALYSIS, ONCE-DAILY OCA 25 MG MET, WITH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE, THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT AGREED WITH THE FDA OF FIBROSIS IMPROVEMENT BY AT LEAST ONE STAGE WITH NO WORSENING OF NASH (DEFINED AS NO WORSENING OF HEPATOCELLULAR BALLOONING, NO WORSENING OF LOBULAR INFLAMMATION AND NO WORSENING OF STEATOSIS) AT THE PLANNED 18-MONTH ANALYSIS AND ADVERSE EVENTS WERE GENERALLY MILD TO MODERATE IN SEVERITY AND THE MOST COMMON WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE KNOWN PROFILE OF OCA. ALTHOUGH A NUMERICALLY GREATER PROPORTION OF PATIENTS IN BOTH OCA TREATMENT GROUPS COMPARED TO PLACEBO ACHIEVED THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT OF NASH RESOLUTION WITH NO WORSENING OF LIVER FIBROSIS IN THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ANALYSIS, THIS RESULT DID NOT REACH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. NASH RESOLUTION IS DEFINED AS THE OVERALL HISTOPATHOLOGIC INTERPRETATION OF (I) NO FATTY LIVER DISEASE OR (II) FATTY LIVER DISEASE (SIMPLE OR ISOLATED STEATOSIS) WITHOUT STEATOHEPATITIS AND A NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE ACTIVITY SCORE (\u201cNAS\u201d) OF 0 FOR BALLOONING AND 0-1 FOR INFLAMMATION. AS AGREED WITH THE FDA, IN ORDER FOR THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE TO BE MET, THE STUDY WAS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE ONE OF THE TWO PRIMARY ENDPOINTS. WE CURRENTLY INTEND TO FILE AN NDA WITH THE FDA IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 SEEKING APPROVAL OF OCA FOR NASH, AND AN MAA WITH THE EMA FOR OCA FOR NASH IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. REGENERATE IS PLANNED TO CONTINUE THROUGH CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN ORDER TO CONFIRM CLINICAL BENEFIT. THE END-OF-STUDY ANALYSIS WILL EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF OCA ON MORTALITY AND LIVER-RELATED CLINICAL OUTCOMES, AS WELL AS ITS LONG-TERM SAFETY.  FINANCIAL OVERVIEW  REVENUE  WE COMMENCED OUR COMMERCIAL LAUNCH OF OCALIVA FOR THE TREATMENT OF PBC IN THE UNITED STATES IN JUNE 2016. IN DECEMBER 2016, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION GRANTED CONDITIONAL APPROVAL FOR OCALIVA FOR THE TREATMENT OF PBC AND WE COMMENCED OUR EUROPEAN COMMERCIAL LAUNCH IN JANUARY 2017. SINCE JANUARY 2017, OCALIVA HAS ALSO RECEIVED REGULATORY APPROVAL IN SEVERAL OF OUR TARGET MARKETS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, INCLUDING CANADA, ISRAEL AND AUSTRALIA. WE SELL OCALIVA TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF SPECIALTY PHARMACIES WHICH DISPENSE THE PRODUCT DIRECTLY TO PATIENTS. THE SPECIALTY PHARMACIES ARE REFERRED TO AS OUR CUSTOMERS.  EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, WE BEGAN RECOGNIZING REVENUE UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 606,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (\u201cASC 606\u201d). THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THIS REVENUE STANDARD IS THAT A COMPANY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. THE FOLLOWING FIVE STEPS ARE APPLIED TO ACHIEVE THAT CORE PRINCIPLE.  \u00b7  STEP 1: IDENTIFY THE CONTRACT WITH THE CUSTOMER  \u00b7  STEP 2: IDENTIFY THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT  \u00b7  STEP 3: DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE  \u00b7  STEP 4: ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT  \u00b7  STEP 5: RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN THE COMPANY SATISFIES A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION  PRODUCT REVENUE, NET  WE PROVIDE THE RIGHT OF RETURN TO OUR CUSTOMERS FOR UNOPENED PRODUCT FOR A LIMITED TIME BEFORE AND AFTER ITS EXPIRATION DATE. PRIOR TO JULY 2017, GIVEN OUR LIMITED SALES HISTORY FOR OCALIVA AND THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES IN ESTIMATING PRODUCT RETURNS, WE DETERMINED THAT THE SHIPMENTS OF OCALIVA MADE TO OUR CUSTOMERS DID NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT. ACCORDINGLY, WE RECOGNIZED REVENUE WHEN THE PRODUCT WAS SOLD THROUGH BY OUR CUSTOMERS, PROVIDED ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA WERE MET. WE INVOICED OUR CUSTOMERS UPON SHIPMENT OF OCALIVA TO THEM AND RECORDED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY FOR DEFERRED REVENUE EQUAL TO THE GROSS INVOICE PRICE. WE THEN RECOGNIZED REVENUE WHEN OCALIVA WAS SOLD THROUGH AS SPECIALTY PHARMACIES DISPENSED PRODUCT DIRECTLY TO THE PATIENTS (SELL-THROUGH BASIS). WE RE-EVALUATED OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INCLUDED THE ACCUMULATION AND REVIEW OF CUSTOMER-RELATED TRANSACTIONS SINCE OUR COMMERCIAL LAUNCH IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2016. WE CONCLUDED WE HAD ACCUMULATED SUFFICIENT DATA TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE PRODUCT RETURNS AND, THEREFORE, BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT TO OUR CUSTOMERS (SELL-IN BASIS).  UNDER ASC 606, WE HAVE WRITTEN CONTRACTS WITH EACH OF OUR CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE A SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION \u2014 TO DELIVER PRODUCTS UPON RECEIPT OF A CUSTOMER ORDER \u2014 AND THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED WHEN DELIVERY OCCURS AND THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES OCALIVA. WE EVALUATE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF EACH OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER COLLECTION IS REASONABLY ASSURED. WE ESTIMATE VARIABLE REVENUE BY CALCULATING GROSS PRODUCT REVENUES BASED ON THE WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COST THAT WE CHARGE OUR CUSTOMERS FOR OCALIVA, AND THEN ESTIMATING OUR NET PRODUCT REVENUES BY DEDUCTING (I) TRADE ALLOWANCES, SUCH AS INVOICE DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT AND CUSTOMER FEES, (II) ESTIMATED GOVERNMENT REBATES AND DISCOUNTS RELATED TO MEDICARE, MEDICAID AND OTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, AND (III) ESTIMATED COSTS OF INCENTIVES OFFERED TO CERTAIN INDIRECT CUSTOMERS INCLUDING PATIENTS.  WE RECOGNIZED NET SALES OF OCALIVA OF $51.8 MILLION AND $35.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  LICENSING REVENUE  IN MARCH 2011, WE ENTERED INTO AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cORIGINAL SUMITOMO AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH SUMITOMO DAINIPPON PHARMA CO., LTD. (\u201cSUMITOMO DAINIPPON\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH WE GRANTED TO SUMITOMO DAINIPPON AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO RESEARCH, DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE OCA FOR THE TREATMENT OF PBC AND NASH IN JAPAN AND CHINA (EXCLUDING TAIWAN) AND AN OPTION TO RESEARCH, DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE OCA IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF SUCH TERRITORIES (THE \u201cCOUNTRY OPTION\u201d). WE RECEIVED AN UPFRONT PAYMENT FROM SUMITOMO DAINIPPON OF $15.0 MILLION UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL SUMITOMO AGREEMENT. IN MAY 2014, SUMITOMO DAINIPPON EXERCISED THE COUNTRY OPTION IN PART TO ADD KOREA AS PART OF ITS LICENSED TERRITORIES AND PAID US A $1.0 MILLION UPFRONT FEE IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. IN FEBRUARY 2018, WE AND SUMITOMO DAINIPPON ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT NO. 3 (THE \u201cSUMITOMO AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE ORIGINAL SUMITOMO AGREEMENT (AS AMENDED, THE \u201cSUMITOMO AGREEMENT\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH (I) SUMITOMO DAINIPPON AGREED TO RETURN THE RIGHTS TO DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE OCA IN JAPAN AND KOREA AND WAIVED ITS RIGHTS TO THE COUNTRY OPTION, (II) WE AGREED TO FOREGO ANY FURTHER MILESTONE OR ROYALTY PAYMENTS RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OCA IN JAPAN AND KOREA AND (III) CERTAIN MILESTONE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OCA WERE ADJUSTED. IN ADDITION, WE AND SUMITOMO DAINIPPON AGREED THAT IF CERTAIN CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES IN CHINA ARE NOT MET BY DECEMBER 31, 2020, SUMITOMO DAINIPPON MAY CHOOSE EITHER TO MAKE A MILESTONE PAYMENT TO US OR TERMINATE THE SUMITOMO AGREEMENT. SUMITOMO DAINIPPON MAY ALSO TERMINATE THE SUMITOMO AGREEMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY OR ON AN INDICATION-BY-INDICATION BASIS AT ANY TIME UPON 90 DAYS\u2019 WRITTEN NOTICE.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD ACHIEVED $6.0 MILLION OF DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES UNDER THE SUMITOMO AGREEMENT.  WE MAY BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS UNDER THE SUMITOMO AGREEMENT IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF UP TO APPROXIMATELY $23.0 MILLION BASED ON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN CLINICAL TRIAL AND REGULATORY-RELATED EVENTS AND TIERED ROYALTY PAYMENTS UP TO THE MID-TWENTIES IN PERCENTAGE TERMS BASED ON NET SALES OF OCA PRODUCTS IN CHINA (EXCLUDING TAIWAN).  FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, THE UPFRONT PAYMENTS WERE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE AND AMORTIZED OVER TIME AND MILESTONE PAYMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ONCE EARNED. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, WE RECOGNIZED $0.4 MILLION AND $0.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN LICENSING REVENUE RELATED TO THE AMORTIZATION OF THE UPFRONT PAYMENTS UNDER THE SUMITOMO AGREEMENT. INCLUDED IN LICENSING REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 IS $0.4 MILLION RELATED TO THE ACCELERATED RECOGNITION, AS A RESULT OF THE SUMITOMO AMENDMENT, OF THE REMAINING PORTION OF DEFERRED REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE $1.0 MILLION UPFRONT PAYMENT THAT WE RECEIVED UNDER THE ORIGINAL SUMITOMO AGREEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH SUMITOMO DAINIPPON\u2019S EXERCISE OF THE COUNTRY OPTION WITH RESPECT TO  KOREA  . WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL REVENUE OF APPROXIMATELY $2.0 MILLION THROUGH JUNE 2020, RELATED TO THE AMORTIZATION OF UPFRONT PAYMENTS UNDER THE SUMITOMO AGREEMENT.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  WE HAVE INCURRED AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF, AMONG OTHER INITIATIVES, THE LAUNCH AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OCALIVA FOR PBC IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND OUR OTHER TARGET MARKETS, THE PREPARATION FOR THE POTENTIAL COMMERCIALIZATION OF OCA FOR NASH, IF APPROVED, AND OUR OTHER  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FUTURE APPROVED PRODUCTS, IF ANY, AND THE BUILD-OUT OF OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  SINCE OUR INCEPTION, WE HAVE FOCUSED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES ON OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING CONDUCTING PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS, PURSUING REGULATORY APPROVALS AND ENGAGING IN OTHER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. WE RECOGNIZE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AS THEY ARE INCURRED.  WE HAVE INCURRED AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF, AMONG OTHER INITIATIVES, OUR CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS FOR OCA FOR PBC AND NASH, OUR OTHER EARLIER STAGE RESEARCH PROGRAMS AND OUR REGULATORY APPROVAL EFFORTS.

FUTURE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD $353.5 MILLION IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENT DEBT SECURITIES. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019. THESE EXPENSES ARE PLANNED TO SUPPORT, AMONG OTHER INITIATIVES, THE CONTINUED COMMERCIALIZATION OF OCALIVA FOR PBC IN THE UNITED STATES AND OUR OTHER MARKETS, OUR CONTINUED CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF OCA FOR PBC AND NASH AND OUR OTHER EARLIER STAGE RESEARCH PROGRAMS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CAPITAL RESOURCES, TOGETHER WITH OUR NET SALES OF OCALIVA FOR PBC, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR ANTICIPATED OPERATING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO FUND OUR OPERATING REQUIREMENTS BEYOND THAT PERIOD. FURTHERMORE, IN LIGHT OF THE NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION, ANY DELAYS IN, OR UNANTICIPATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH, OUR DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY OR COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL REQUIRED BY US TO FUND OUR OPERATING REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY SEEK TO ACCESS THE PUBLIC OR PRIVATE CAPITAL MARKETS WHENEVER CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE, EVEN IF WE DO NOT HAVE AN IMMEDIATE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AT THAT TIME. OUR FORECAST REGARDING THE PERIOD OF TIME THROUGH WHICH OUR FINANCIAL RESOURCES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS IS A FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT THAT INVOLVES RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AND ACTUAL RESULTS, INCLUDING THE COSTS TO MAINTAIN OUR CURRENTLY PLANNED OPERATIONS, COULD VARY MATERIALLY.  OUR FORECASTS REGARDING THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT OUR EXISTING CAPITAL RESOURCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND THE TIMING OF OUR FUTURE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, BOTH NEAR AND LONG-TERM, WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THIS FORM 10-Q CONTAINS CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDING EXPECTATIONS OF MARKET CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES AND PLANS, WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 21E OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, AND IS SUBJECT TO THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS CREATED BY THAT STATUTE. SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND BELIEFS, INCLUDING ESTIMATES AND PROJECTIONS ABOUT OUR BUSINESS AND INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, STATEMENTS CONCERNING FINANCIAL POSITION, BUSINESS STRATEGY, AND PLANS OR OBJECTIVES FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEES OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM MANAGEMENT\u2019S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS. SUCH RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE THOSE SET FORTH IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING \u201c  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\u201d.  THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS REPORT SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE TIME THEY ARE MADE, AND DO NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT MANAGEMENT\u2019S OUTLOOK AT ANY OTHER POINT IN TIME. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS, OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON, HOWEVER, READERS SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE RISK FACTORS SET FORTH IN OTHER REPORTS OR DOCUMENTS WE FILE FROM TIME TO TIME WITH THE SEC AFTER THE DATE OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT.  OVERVIEW  COHU IS A LEADING SUPPLIER OF SEMICONDUCTOR TEST AND INSPECTION HANDLERS, MICRO-ELECTRO MECHANICAL SYSTEM (MEMS) TEST MODULES, TEST CONTACTORS AND THERMAL SUBSYSTEMS, SEMICONDUCTOR AUTOMATED TEST EQUIPMENT AND BARE-BOARD PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD TEST SYSTEMS USED BY GLOBAL SEMICONDUCTOR AND ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURERS AND TEST SUBCONTRACTORS. WE OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OUR REVENUE FROM CAPITAL EQUIPMENT PRODUCTS IS DRIVEN BY THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE BUDGETS AND SPENDING PATTERNS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WHO OFTEN DELAY OR ACCELERATE PURCHASES IN REACTION TO VARIATIONS IN THEIR BUSINESS. THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY THESE COMPANIES DEPENDS ON THE CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED MARKET DEMAND FOR SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES AND PCBS AND THE PRODUCTS THAT INCORPORATE THEM. OUR CONSUMABLE PRODUCTS ARE DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES AND PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARDS THAT ARE TESTED AND BY THE CONTINUOUS INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES BY OUR CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT, OUR CONSUMABLE PRODUCTS PROVIDE A MORE STABLE RECURRING SOURCE OF REVENUE AND GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE THE SAME DEGREE OF CYCLICALITY AS OUR CAPITAL EQUIPMENT PRODUCTS.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019, OUR NET SALES INCREASED 55.3% YEAR-OVER-YEAR TO $147.8 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN OUR NET SALES WAS DRIVEN BY THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA CORPORATION, COMPLETED ON OCTOBER 1, 2018, AND OUR RESULTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER INCLUDED SALES OF $82.5 MILLION CONTRIBUTED BY THIS ACQUIRED BUSINESS.  THE GLOBAL SEMICONDUCTOR MARKET GREW IN 2018 REACHING A PEAK IN THE SECOND QUARTER WITH BUSINESS CONDITIONS SOFTENING DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2018. THIS WEAKNESS HAS CONTINUED INTO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND CUSTOMER TEST CELL UTILIZATION REMAINS BELOW LEVELS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY TRIGGERED THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPACITY. CURRENT MARKET WEAKNESS IS BEING DRIVEN BY LOWER SMARTPHONE UNIT SHIPMENTS, WEAKER AUTOMOTIVE SEMICONDUCTOR DEMAND, AND ONGOING SOFTNESS IN THE CHINA MARKET THAT IS IN PART RELATED TO TRADE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA. THE CURRENT NEAR TERM OUTLOOK FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY FOR 2019 ASSUMES SLOWER ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT DEMAND AND SLOWER GROWTH FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. DESPITE THE NEAR TERM WEAKNESS, WE REMAIN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE LONG-TERM PROSPECTS FOR OUR BUSINESS DUE TO INCREASING UBIQUITY OF SEMICONDUCTORS, THE FUTURE ROLLOUT OF 5G NETWORKS, DIMINISHING IMPACT OF PARALLEL TEST, INCREASING SEMICONDUCTOR COMPLEXITY, INCREASING QUALITY DEMANDS FROM SEMICONDUCTOR CUSTOMERS, AND CONTINUED PROLIFERATION OF ELECTRONICS IN A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS ACROSS THE AUTOMOTIVE, MOBILITY AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS. WE ARE FOCUSED ON GROWING OUR MARKET SHARE WITH SEMICONDUCTOR AND ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURERS AND TEST SUBCONTRACTORS.  APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  AND POLICIES  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, FORECASTS AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, HOWEVER ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. THE METHODS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS WE REPORT IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SOME OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE US TO MAKE DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COHU, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  MARCH 30, 2019  OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO AN INVESTOR\u2019S UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION AND THAT REQUIRE COMPLEX MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT INCLUDE.  \u25cf  REVENUE RECOGNITION, INCLUDING THE DEFERRAL OF REVENUE ON SALES TO CUSTOMERS, WHICH IMPACTS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS;  \u25cf  ESTIMATION OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES, SPECIFICALLY PRODUCT WARRANTY, INVENTORY RESERVES AND ALLOWANCE FOR BAD DEBTS, WHICH IMPACT GROSS MARGIN OR OPERATING EXPENSES;  \u25cf  THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WHICH IMPACT OUR TAX PROVISION;  \u25cf  THE ASSESSMENT OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH PRIMARILY IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN OR OPERATING EXPENSES IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENTS OF ASSETS OR ACCELERATE THEIR DEPRECIATION OR AMORTIZATION; AND  \u25cf  THE VALUATION AND RECOGNITION OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, WHICH IMPACTS GROSS MARGIN, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE, AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE.  BELOW, WE DISCUSS THESE POLICIES FURTHER, AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED. WE ALSO HAVE OTHER POLICIES THAT WE CONSIDER KEY ACCOUNTING POLICIES; HOWEVER, THESE POLICIES TYPICALLY DO NOT REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS THAT ARE DIFFICULT OR SUBJECTIVE.  REVENUE RECOGNITION.  OUR NET SALES ARE DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ARE ADJUSTED FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES, WHICH HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN INSIGNIFICANT. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TERMS OF A CONTRACT WITH OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SATISFIED; GENERALLY, THIS OCCURS WITH THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL OF OUR SYSTEMS, NON-SYSTEM PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE CONTROL IS NOT TRANSFERRED UNTIL DESTINATION OR ACCEPTANCE, WE DEFER REVENUE RECOGNITION UNTIL SUCH EVENTS OCCUR. REVENUE FOR ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY SATISFIED A CUSTOMER\u2019S ACCEPTANCE REQUIREMENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT. IN CASES WHERE A PRIOR HISTORY OF CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE CANNOT BE DEMONSTRATED OR FROM SALES WHERE CUSTOMER PAYMENT DATES ARE NOT DETERMINABLE AND IN THE CASE OF NEW PRODUCTS, REVENUE AND COST OF SALES ARE DEFERRED UNTIL CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE HAS BEEN RECEIVED. OUR POST-SHIPMENT OBLIGATIONS TYPICALLY INCLUDE INSTALLATION AND STANDARD WARRANTIES. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF INSTALLATION RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD THE INSTALLATION IS PERFORMED. SERVICE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME AS THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL IS COMPLETED FOR THE RELATED CONTRACT OR UPON COMPLETION OF THE SERVICES IF THEY ARE SHORT-TERM IN NATURE. SPARES, CONTACTOR AND KIT REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT. CERTAIN OF OUR EQUIPMENT SALES HAVE MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVE THE DELIVERY OR PERFORMANCE OF MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, AND TRANSFER OF CONTROL OF PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS MAY OCCUR AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME OR OVER DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME. FOR ARRANGEMENTS CONTAINING MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, THE REVENUE RELATING TO THE UNDELIVERED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS DEFERRED USING THE RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE METHOD UTILIZING ESTIMATED SALES PRICES UNTIL SATISFACTION OF THE DEFERRED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. UNSATISFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY REPRESENT CONTRACTS FOR PRODUCTS WITH FUTURE DELIVERY DATES. AT MARCH 30, 2019, WE HAVE $16.8 MILLION OF REVENUE EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FUTURE RELATED TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE UNSATISFIED (OR PARTIALLY UNSATISFIED) FOR CONTRACTS WITH ORIGINAL EXPECTED DURATIONS OF OVER ONE YEAR.  AS ALLOWED UNDER ASC 606, WE HAVE OPTED TO NOT DISCLOSE UNSATISFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AS THESE CONTRACTS HAVE ORIGINAL EXPECTED DURATIONS OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR. WE GENERALLY SELL OUR EQUIPMENT WITH A PRODUCT WARRANTY. THE PRODUCT WARRANTY PROVIDES ASSURANCE TO CUSTOMERS THAT DELIVERED PRODUCTS ARE AS SPECIFIED IN THE CONTRACT (AN \u201cASSURANCE-TYPE WARRANTY\u201d). THEREFORE, WE ACCOUNT FOR SUCH PRODUCT WARRANTIES UNDER ASC 460, GUARANTEES (ASC 460), AND NOT AS A SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. THE TRANSACTION PRICE REFLECTS OUR EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE CONSIDERATION WE WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE FROM THE CUSTOMER AND MAY INCLUDE FIXED OR VARIABLE AMOUNTS. FIXED CONSIDERATION PRIMARILY INCLUDES SALES TO CUSTOMERS THAT ARE KNOWN AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. VARIABLE CONSIDERATION INCLUDES SALES IN WHICH THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION THAT WE WILL RECEIVE IS UNKNOWN AS OF THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD. SUCH CONSIDERATION PRIMARILY INCLUDES SALES MADE TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS WITH CUMULATIVE TIER VOLUME DISCOUNTS OFFERED. VARIABLE CONSIDERATION ARRANGEMENTS ARE RARE; HOWEVER, WHEN THEY OCCUR, WE ESTIMATE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION AS THE EXPECTED VALUE TO WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED. INCLUDED IN THE TRANSACTION PRICE ESTIMATE ARE AMOUNTS IN WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL OF CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED WILL NOT OCCUR WHEN THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION IS SUBSEQUENTLY RESOLVED. THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE FOR PROJECTED FUTURE SALES. VARIABLE CONSIDERATION THAT DOES NOT MEET REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA IS DEFERRED. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE REPRESENTS OUR UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT TO RECEIVE CONSIDERATION FROM OUR CUSTOMER. PAYMENTS TERMS DO NOT EXCEED ONE YEAR FROM THE INVOICE DATE AND THEREFORE DO NOT INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENT. TO DATE, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CONTRACT ASSETS OR CONTRACT LIABILITIES RECORDED ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IN ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED. ON SHIPMENTS WHERE SALES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED, GROSS PROFIT IS GENERALLY RECORDED AS DEFERRED PROFIT IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REPRESENTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECEIVABLE RECORDED AND THE INVENTORY SHIPPED.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  WE MAINTAIN AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS DETERIORATES, RESULTING IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES MAY BE REQUIRED.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COHU, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  MARCH 30, 2019  INVENTORY.  THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY AS WELL AS INVENTORY THAT IS NOT OF SALEABLE QUALITY. THE DETERMINATION OF OBSOLETE OR EXCESS INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE THE FUTURE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THE DEMAND FORECAST IS A DIRECT INPUT IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR SHORT-TERM MANUFACTURING PLANS. WE RECORD VALUATION RESERVES ON OUR INVENTORY FOR ESTIMATED EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY AND LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE CONCERNS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST OF INVENTORY AND THE ESTIMATED REALIZABLE VALUE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE PRODUCT DEMAND, MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT SELLING PRICES. IF FUTURE PRODUCT DEMAND, MARKET CONDITIONS OR PRODUCT SELLING PRICES ARE LESS THAN THOSE PROJECTED BY MANAGEMENT OR IF CONTINUED MODIFICATIONS TO PRODUCTS ARE REQUIRED TO MEET SPECIFICATIONS OR OTHER CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, INCREASES TO INVENTORY RESERVES MAY BE REQUIRED WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN.  INCOME TAXES.  WE ESTIMATE OUR LIABILITY FOR INCOME TAXES BASED ON THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE CONDUCT BUSINESS. THIS REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE OUR (I) CURRENT TAXES; (II) TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES THAT RESULT FROM DIFFERING TREATMENT OF CERTAIN ITEMS FOR TAX AND ACCOUNTING PURPOSES AND (III) UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULT IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IF, BASED UPON ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. ESTABLISHING, REDUCING OR INCREASING A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN AN ACCOUNTING PERIOD GENERALLY RESULTS IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE IN TAX EXPENSE IN THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. WE MUST MAKE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS TO DETERMINE THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND ANY VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO BE RECORDED AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. OUR GROSS DEFERRED TAX ASSET BALANCE AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, WAS APPROXIMATELY $126.3 MILLION, WITH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $83.9 MILLION. OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF RESERVES AND ACCRUALS THAT ARE NOT YET DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX AND TAX CREDIT AND NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS.  SEGMENT  INFORMATION.  WE APPLIED THE PROVISIONS OF ASC TOPIC 280,  SEGMENT REPORTING  , (\u201cASC 280\u201d), WHICH SETS FORTH A MANAGEMENT APPROACH TO SEGMENT REPORTING AND ESTABLISHES REQUIREMENTS TO REPORT SELECTED SEGMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY AND TO REPORT ANNUALLY ENTITY-WIDE DISCLOSURES ABOUT PRODUCTS, MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND THE GEOGRAPHIES IN WHICH THE ENTITY HOLDS MATERIAL ASSETS AND REPORTS REVENUE. AN OPERATING SEGMENT IS DEFINED AS A COMPONENT THAT ENGAGES IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES WHOSE OPERATING RESULTS ARE REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER AND FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. AFTER THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA ON OCTOBER 1, 2018, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT OUR FOUR IDENTIFIED OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE: TEST HANDLER GROUP (\u201cTHG\u201d), SEMICONDUCTOR TEST GROUP (\u201cSTG\u201d), INTERFACE SOLUTIONS GROUP (\u201cISG\u201d) AND PCB TEST GROUP (\u201cPTG\u201d). OUR THG, STG AND ISG OPERATING SEGMENTS QUALIFY FOR AGGREGATION UNDER ASC 280 DUE TO SIMILARITIES IN THEIR CUSTOMERS, THEIR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS, AND THE NATURE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED. AS A RESULT, WE REPORT IN TWO SEGMENTS, SEMICONDUCTOR TEST & INSPECTION AND PCB TEST.  GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  WE EVALUATE GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BY FIRST COMPARING THE BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNITS. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN THE BOOK VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL AND THE CARRYING VALUE. WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS PRIMARILY USING THE INCOME APPROACH VALUATION METHODOLOGY THAT INCLUDES THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE MARKET APPROACH AND CERTAIN MARKET MULTIPLES AS A VALIDATION OF THE VALUES DERIVED USING THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. FORECASTS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF FUTURE NET SALES AND OPERATING EXPENSES, BASED PRIMARILY ON CUSTOMER FORECASTS, INDUSTRY TRADE ORGANIZATION DATA AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  WE CONDUCT OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST AS OF OCTOBER 1ST OF EACH YEAR, AND HAVE DETERMINED THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2018, AS WE DETERMINED THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES ON THAT DATE. OTHER EVENTS AND CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES MAY ALSO REQUIRE GOODWILL TO BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT DATES. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE OCCURRED THAT INDICATE IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL IS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT. IN THE EVENT WE DETERMINE THAT AN INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS REQUIRED, IN A FUTURE PERIOD, THE REVIEW MAY RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  LONG-LIVED ASSETS, OTHER THAN GOODWILL, ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSETS MIGHT NOT BE RECOVERABLE. CONDITIONS THAT WOULD NECESSITATE AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE OBSERVABLE MARKET VALUE OF AN ASSET, A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OR MANNER IN WHICH AN ASSET IS USED, OR ANY OTHER SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS, IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE ONLY RECORDED IF THE ASSET\u2019S CARRYING AMOUNT IS NOT RECOVERABLE THROUGH ITS UNDISCOUNTED, PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. WE MEASURE THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COHU, INC.

WE PROVIDE FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF PRODUCT WARRANTIES IN THE PERIOD SALES ARE RECOGNIZED. OUR WARRANTY OBLIGATION ESTIMATES ARE AFFECTED BY HISTORICAL PRODUCT SHIPMENT LEVELS, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS INCURRED IN CORRECTING PRODUCT PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS. SHOULD PRODUCT PERFORMANCE, MATERIAL USAGE OR LABOR REPAIR COSTS DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITY WOULD BE REQUIRED.  CONTINGENCIES.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONTINGENCIES THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESSES WHICH REQUIRE US TO ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT FUTURE EVENTS WILL CONFIRM THE EXISTENCE OF A LOSS OR AN IMPAIRMENT OF AN ASSET. IF A LOSS OR ASSET IMPAIRMENT IS PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS OR IMPAIRMENT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, WE ACCRUE A CHARGE TO OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD SUCH CONDITIONS BECOME KNOWN.  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE GRANT DATE, REDUCED BY THE PRESENT VALUE OF DIVIDENDS EXPECTED TO BE PAID ON OUR COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO VESTING OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ON PERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS WITH MARKET-BASED GOALS IS CALCULATED USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION MODEL ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO STOCK OPTIONS IS RECORDED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD ON ITS GRANT DATE, WHICH WE ESTIMATE USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES VALUATION MODEL.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  RECENT TRANSACTIONS IMPACTING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  ON OCTOBER 1, 2018 WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA CORPORATION AND THE RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ONLY SINCE THAT DATE. MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT THE FIXTURES SERVICES BUSINESS, THAT WAS ACQUIRED AS PART OF XCERRA, DOES NOT ALIGN WITH COHU\u2019S LONG-TERM STRATEGIC PLAN AND MANAGEMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF DIVESTING THIS PORTION OF THE BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, THE ASSETS OF OUR FIXTURES BUSINESS ARE CONSIDERED \u201cHELD FOR SALE\u201d AND THE OPERATIONS OF OUR FIXTURES BUSINESS ARE CONSIDERED \u201cDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\u201d AS OF MARCH 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 29, 2018. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, THE DISCUSSION BELOW COVERS THE COMPARATIVE RESULTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES CERTAIN OPERATING DATA AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30,  MARCH 31,  2019  2018  NET SALES  100.0%  100.0%  COST OF SALES  (1)  (63.2  )%  (57.7  )%  GROSS MARGIN  (1)  36.8%  42.3%  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  (15.4  )%  (12.4  )%  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  (1)  (25.9  )%  (16.6  )%  AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS  (1)  (6.8  )%  (1.1  )%  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  (0.9  )%  -%  INCOME (LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS  (12.2  )%  12.2%  (1)  IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA WE ASSESSED THE NEED TO REALIGN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION AND CERTAIN INCOME STATEMENT CLASSIFICATIONS WERE ADJUSTED WITH PRIOR PERIODS RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM WITH CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTATION. SEE NOTE 1, \u201cRECLASSIFICATIONS\u201d LOCATED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q.  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  NET SALES  OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES INCREASED 55.3% TO $147.8 MILLION IN 2019, COMPARED TO NET SALES OF $95.2 MILLION IN 2018. ON OCTOBER 1, 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA AND OUR NET SALES FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 INCLUDE $82.5 MILLION OF NET SALES RECOGNIZED BY THIS BUSINESS AND IS THE DRIVER OF THE INCREASE IN OUR NET SALES. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE ADDITIONAL SALES FROM XCERRA, NET SALES DECREASED YEAR OVER YEAR AS A RESULT OF SOFTER DEMAND FOR SMARTPHONES, WEAKER AUTOMOTIVE SEMICONDUCTOR DEMAND, ONGOING SOFTNESS IN THE CHINA MARKET THAT IS IN PART RELATED TO TRADE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA..  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COHU, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  MARCH 30, 2019  GROSS MARGIN  (EXCLUSIVE OF AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DESCRIBED BELOW)  GROSS MARGIN CONSISTS OF NET SALES LESS COST OF SALES. COST OF SALES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THE COST OF MATERIALS, ASSEMBLY AND TEST LABOR, AND OVERHEAD FROM OPERATIONS. OUR GROSS MARGIN CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD, PRODUCT SUPPORT COSTS, INVENTORY RESERVE ADJUSTMENTS, AND UTILIZATION OF MANUFACTURING CAPACITY. OUR GROSS MARGIN, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, WAS 36.8% IN 2019 AND 42.3% IN 2018. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE CERTAIN ITEMS WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY AFFECTED GROSS MARGIN ARE NOW BEING REFLECTED IN OPERATING EXPENSES. PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AMOUNTS WERE ALSO ADJUSTED TO REFLECT CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTATION. THIS RESULTED IN EXPENSES TOTALING $7.6 MILLION AND $0.7 MILLION BEING REPORTED IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES RATHER THAN COST OF SALES IN 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. INDEPENDENT OF THE IMPACT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECLASSIFICATIONS GROSS MARGIN IN 2019 WAS IMPACTED BY THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA AS DISCUSSED BELOW.  OUR COST OF SALES WAS IMPACTED BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INVENTORY STEP-UP RELATED TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS TO INVENTORY ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019, WE AMORTIZED $6.0 MILLION OF INVENTORY STEP-UP RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF XCERRA. THERE WAS NO INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZED IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2018.  OUR GROSS MARGIN CAN BE IMPACTED BY CHARGES TO COST OF SALES RELATED TO EXCESS, OBSOLETE AND LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE INVENTORY ISSUES. WE COMPUTE THE MAJORITY OF OUR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY RESERVE REQUIREMENTS USING A ONE-YEAR INVENTORY USAGE FORECAST. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND 2018, WE RECORDED CHARGES TO COST OF SALES OF APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION AND $0.7 MILLION FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, AS PART OF THE INTEGRATION AND RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES RELATED TO XCERRA WE RECORDED $0.5 MILLION OF INVENTORY RELATED CHARGES RELATED TO THE DECISION TO END MANUFACTURING OF CERTAIN OF XCERRA\u2019S SEMICONDUCTOR TEST HANDLER PRODUCTS. WHILE WE BELIEVE OUR RESERVES FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY AND LOWER OF COST OR MARKET CONCERNS ARE ADEQUATE TO COVER KNOWN EXPOSURES AT MARCH 30, 2019, REDUCTIONS IN CUSTOMER FORECASTS OR CONTINUED MODIFICATIONS TO PRODUCTS, AS A RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO MEET SPECIFICATIONS OR OTHER CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CHARGES TO OPERATIONS THAT COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND GROSS MARGIN IN FUTURE PERIODS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE (\u201cR&D EXPENSE\u201d)  R&D EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND RELATED COSTS OF EMPLOYEES ENGAGED IN ONGOING RESEARCH, PRODUCT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, COSTS OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES, AND PROFESSIONAL CONSULTING EXPENSES. R&D EXPENSE WAS $22.7 MILLION OR 15.4% OF NET SALES IN 2019, COMPARED TO $11.8 MILLION OR 12.4% IN 2018. THE INCREASE IN R&D EXPENSE IN 2019 WAS PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA, WHICH ADDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES TOTALING $12.0 MILLION. R&D EXPENSES UNRELATED TO XCERRA DECREASED DUE TO COST CONTROL INITIATIVES IMPLEMENTED AS A RESULT OF CURRENT BUSINESS CONDITIONS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE (\u201cSG&A EXPENSE\u201d)  SG&A EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND BENEFIT COSTS OF EMPLOYEES, COMMISSION EXPENSE FOR INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES, PRODUCT PROMOTION AND COSTS OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. SG&A EXPENSE WAS $38.3  MILLION OR 25.9% OF NET SALES IN 2019, COMPARED TO $15.8 MILLION OR 16.6% IN 2018. THE INCREASE IN SG&A EXPENSE IN 2019 WAS DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA, WHICH ADDED EXPENSES TOTALING $23.4 MILLION FROM ITS OPERATIONS. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, CERTAIN ITEMS WHICH HAVE HISTORICALLY AFFECTED SG&A HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED INTANGIBLES AND FOREIGN TRANSACTION GAIN (LOSS) AND OTHER. PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AMOUNTS WERE ALSO ADJUSTED TO REFLECT CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION. THIS RESULTED IN EXPENSES TOTALING $2.4 MILLION AND $0.4 MILLION BEING REPORTED IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES RATHER THAN SG&A IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS TOTALING $0.2 MILLION AND LOSSES TOTALING $1.6 MILLION RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, ARE NOW REPORTED IN FOREIGN TRANSACTION GAIN (LOSS) AND OTHER. SG&A EXPENSES UNRELATED TO XCERRA\u2019S OPERATIONS WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER DUE TO THE DECREASE IN BUSINESS VOLUME.  AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS  AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED INTANGIBLES IS THE PROCESS OF EXPENSING THE COST OF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET ACQUIRED THROUGH A BUSINESS COMBINATION OVER THE PROJECTED LIFE OF THE ASSET. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE THESE AMOUNTS WERE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED IN COST OF SALES AND SG&A. AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WAS $10.0 MILLION AND $1.1 MILLION FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN EXPENSE RECORDED DURING THE CURRENT YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL AMORTIZATION ASSOCIATED WITH PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS RECORDED AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COHU, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  MARCH 30, 2019  SEE NOTE 2, \u201cBUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\u201d IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA ON OCTOBER 1, 2018, DURING FOURTH QUARTER 2018, WE BEGAN A STRATEGIC RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM DESIGNED TO REPOSITION OUR ORGANIZATION AND IMPROVE OUR COST STRUCTURE AS PART OF OUR TARGETED INTEGRATION PLAN REGARDING XCERRA AND RECORDED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, EXCLUSIVE OF THE $0.5 MILLION OF INVENTORY RELATED CHARGES DESCRIBED ABOVE, TOTALING $1.4 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019.  SEE NOTE 4, \u201cRESTRUCTURING CHARGES\u201d IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.  INTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $5.5 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO $11,000 IN THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF 2018. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERM LOAN B OBTAINED TO FINANCE PART OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF XCERRA.  INTEREST INCOME WAS $0.2 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF BOTH 2019 AND 2018.  INCOME  TAXES  ORDINARILY, INTERIM TAX PROVISIONS ARE CALCULATED USING THE ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (\u201cETR\u201d) EXPECTED TO BE APPLICABLE FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR. HOWEVER, WHEN A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE ANNUAL ETR CANNOT BE MADE, THE ACTUAL ETR FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD MAY BE THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE ANNUAL ETR. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019, WE USED THE ACTUAL YEAR-TO-DATE ETR IN COMPUTING OUR TAX PROVISION, AS A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE 2019 ANNUAL ETR CANNOT BE MADE, SINCE RELATIVELY SMALL CHANGES IN OUR PROJECTED INCOME PRODUCE A SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN OUR ETR. IN COMPUTING THE TAX PROVISION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WE USED THE ETR EXPECTED TO BE APPLICABLE FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR. THE ETR ON INCOME OR LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019 AND MARCH 31, 2018 WAS 0.9% AND 20.8%, RESPECTIVELY. THE TAX PROVISION ON INCOME OR LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2019 AND 2018 DIFFERS FROM THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LACK OF A TAX BENEFIT ON OUR DOMESTIC LOSSES AS A RESULT OF OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, FOREIGN INCOME TAXED AT DIFFERENT RATES, CHANGES IN OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCE, STATE TAXES AND INTEREST RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.  OUR GERMAN SUBSIDIARIES INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2012 TO 2016 ARE CURRENTLY UNDER ROUTINE EXAMINATION BY TAX AUTHORITIES IN GERMANY. WE BELIEVE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENT ACCRUALS FOR INCOME TAXES ARE APPROPRIATE.  OTHER THAN FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, THERE WAS NO MATERIAL CHANGE TO OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND RELATED ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019 AND MARCH 31, 2018.  INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND NET INCOME  AS A RESULT OF THE FACTORS SET FORTH ABOVE, OUR LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND NET LOSS WAS $22.9 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019. IN 2018, INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND NET INCOME WAS $8.1 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURERS AND TEST SUBCONTRACTORS THAT ARE, IN TURN, DEPENDENT ON THE CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED MARKET DEMAND FOR SEMICONDUCTORS. THE SEASONAL AND VOLATILE NATURE OF DEMAND FOR SEMICONDUCTOR EQUIPMENT, OUR PRIMARY INDUSTRY, MAKES ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NET CASH FLOWS DIFFICULT.  OUR PRIMARY HISTORICAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES HAS BEEN CASH FLOW GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS AND WE MANAGE OUR BUSINESSES TO MAXIMIZE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. WE USE CASH TO FUND GROWTH IN OUR OPERATING ASSETS AND TO FUND NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS PRIMARILY THROUGH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, $91.4 MILLION OR 57% OF OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IF THESE FUNDS ARE NEEDED FOR OUR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ACCRUE AND PAY FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES IF WE REPATRIATE THESE FUNDS. EXCEPT FOR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, WE PROVIDE FOR ALL WITHHOLDING AND OTHER RESIDUAL TAXES RELATED TO UNREMITTED EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. BEGINNING IN 2018, EARNINGS REALIZED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO U.S. TAX IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TAX ACT.  ON OCTOBER 1, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDES FOR A $350.0 MILLION SEVEN-YEAR TERM B LOAN FACILITY AND BORROWED THE FULL AMOUNT. THE TERM B LOAN FACILITY MATURES ON OCTOBER 1, 2025. THESE PROCEEDS WERE USED ON OCTOBER 1, 2018, TOGETHER WITH OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA. SEE NOTE 3 \u201cBORROWINGS AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS\u201d INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COHU, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  MARCH 30, 2019  AT MARCH 30, 2019, OUR TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS, NET OF DISCOUNT AND DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS, WAS $349.2 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED $340.0 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TERM B LOAN, $4.3 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER KITA\u2019S TERM LOANS, $3.2 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER KITA\u2019S LINES OF CREDIT, AND $1.7 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER XCERRA\u2019S TERM LOAN.  LIQUIDITY  WORKING CAPITAL.  THE FOLLOWING SUMMARIZES OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND WORKING CAPITAL.  MARCH 30,  DECEMBER 29,  PERCENTAGE  (IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  DECREASE  CHANGE  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS  $160,086  $165,020  $(4,934  )  (3.0  )%  WORKING CAPITAL  $306,757  $324,650  $(17,893  )  (5.5  )%  CASH FLOWS  OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 CONSISTED OF OUR NET LOSS, ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH EXPENSES AND CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THESE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE DEPRECIATION EXPENSE ON PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES, CONSIDERATION AND AMORTIZATION OF INVENTORY STEP-UP AND INVENTORY RELATED CHARGES RELATED TO XCERRA. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION OF XCERRA, OUR NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 TOTALED $4.7 MILLION. NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN CURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND INCLUDED DECREASES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $17.7 MILLION, INVENTORIES OF $2.5 MILLION, ACCRUED COMPENSATION, WARRANTY AND OTHER LIABILITIES OF $9.6 MILLION, OTHER CURRENT ASSETS $4.0 MILLION, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE $3.5 MILLION, INCOME TAX PAYABLE OF $2.2 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED PROFIT OF $1.4 MILLION. THE CHANGE IN OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE RESULTED FROM A SEQUENTIAL DECREASE IN PRODUCT SHIPMENTS AND THE TIMING OF THE RESULTING CASH CONVERSION CYCLE. THE DECREASE IN INVENTORY IS A RESULT OF LOWER PURCHASES AS A RESULT OF CURRENT BUSINESS CONDITIONS. THE DECREASE IN ACCRUED COMPENSATION, WARRANTY AND OTHER LIABILITIES WAS DRIVEN BY PAYMENTS ON INCENTIVE COMPENSATION RELATED TO 2018 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THE DECREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE IS A RESULT OF TAX PAYMENTS MADE IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND DEFERRED PROFIT INCREASED DUE TO THE DEFERRAL OF SALES IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  INVESTING CASH FLOWS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CASH USED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN SUPPORT OF OUR BUSINESSES, PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENT MATURITIES, ASSET DISPOSALS AND CASH USED FOR PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS AND BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS. NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 TOTALED $3.5 MILLION. ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF $3.5 MILLION WERE MADE TO SUPPORT THE OPERATING AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES OF OUR BUSINESS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF NET PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR STOCK OPTION AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS AND CASH USED TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS, NET OF REPAYMENTS OF DEBT. WE ISSUE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND STOCK OPTIONS AND MAINTAIN AN EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN AS COMPONENTS OF OUR OVERALL EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION. IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, CASH USED TO SETTLE THE MINIMUM STATUTORY TAX WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS ON BEHALF OF OUR EMPLOYEES UPON VESTING OF RESTRICTED AND PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS, NET OF PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS WAS $1.8 MILLION. WE PAID DIVIDENDS TOTALING $2.4 MILLION, OR $0.06 PER COMMON SHARE AND ON MAY 2, 2019, COHU\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.06 PER SHARE PAYABLE ON JULY 26, 2019, TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON JUNE 14, 2019. FUTURE QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS ARE SUBJECT TO OUR CASH LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL AVAILABILITY AND PERIODIC DETERMINATIONS BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT CASH DIVIDENDS ARE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS. FURTHERMORE, FUTURE QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS MAY BE REDUCED FROM HISTORICAL LEVELS, OR SUSPENDED, AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. TOTAL REPAYMENTS OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND LONG-TERM DEBT DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 TOTALED $1.0 MILLION.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  IN ADDITION TO THE BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDES FOR A $350.0 MILLION SEVEN-YEAR TERM B LOAN FACILITY AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE HAVE ACCESS TO OTHER CREDIT FACILITIES TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS IF NEEDED.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COHU, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  MARCH 30, 2019  AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF XCERRA, WE ASSUMED A TERM LOAN RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF XCERRA\u2019S FACILITY IN ROSENHEIM, GERMANY. THE LOAN IS PAYABLE OVER 10 YEARS AT AN ANNUAL INTEREST RATE OF 2.35%. PRINCIPAL PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST IS DUE QUARTERLY OVER THE DURATION OF THE TERM LOAN. AT MARCH 30, 2019, THE OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCE WAS $1.7 MILLION AND $0.3 MILLION OF THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE IS PRESENTED AS CURRENT INSTALLMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE TERM LOAN IS DENOMINATED IN EUROS AND, AS A RESULT, AMOUNTS DISCLOSED HEREIN WILL FLUCTUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF KITA ON JANUARY 4, 2017, WE ASSUMED A SERIES OF REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENTS WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN JAPAN. THE CREDIT FACILITIES RENEW MONTHLY AND PROVIDE KITA WITH ACCESS TO WORKING CAPITAL TOTALING UP TO $6.3 MILLION. AT MARCH 30, 2019, TOTAL BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING LINES OF CREDIT WERE $3.2 MILLION. AS THESE CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENTS RENEW MONTHLY, THEY HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. WE ALSO HAVE LONG-TERM TERM LOANS FROM A SERIES OF JAPANESE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TOTALING $4.3 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF KITA\u2019S FACILITY IN OSAKA, JAPAN. THE LOANS ARE COLLATERALIZED BY THE FACILITY AND LAND. THE LOANS CARRY INTEREST RATES RANGING FROM 0.05% TO 0.45% AND EXPIRE AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH 2034. AT MARCH 30, 2019, $0.7 MILLION OF THE TERM LOANS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN CURRENT INSTALLMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE REVOLVING LINES OF CREDIT AND TERM LOANS ARE DENOMINATED IN JAPANESE YEN AND, AS A RESULT, AMOUNTS WILL FLUCTUATE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  WE ALSO HAVE A CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION UNDER WHICH IT ADMINISTERS A LINE OF CREDIT ON BEHALF OF OUR WHOLLY OWNED ISMECA SUBSIDIARY. THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES ISMECA WITH 2.0 MILLION SWISS FRANCS OF AVAILABLE CREDIT AND AT MARCH 30, 2019, NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING.  WE HAVE A LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cLC FACILITY\u201d) UNDER WHICH BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., HAS AGREED TO ADMINISTER THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT ON OUR BEHALF. THE LC FACILITY REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN DEPOSITS OF CASH OR OTHER APPROVED INVESTMENTS IN AMOUNTS THAT APPROXIMATE OUR OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AND CONTAINS CUSTOMARY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS. IN ADDITION, OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, XCERRA, HAS ARRANGEMENTS WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND BANK GUARANTEES. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, $0.9 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND BANK GUARANTEES.  WE EXPECT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT PRESENT WORKING CAPITAL WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR OPERATING REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  CONTRACTUAL  OBLIGATIONS.  OUR SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS CONSIST OF LIABILITIES FOR DEBT, OPERATING LEASES, UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, PENSIONS, POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND WARRANTIES. OTHER THAN CHANGES RELATED TO ADOPTION OF NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THESE OBLIGATIONS OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS FROM THOSE DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018.  COMMITMENTS TO CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO COMMITMENTS WITH OUR VENDORS AND OUTSOURCING PARTNERS TO PURCHASE INVENTORY AT FIXED PRICES OR IN GUARANTEED QUANTITIES. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SUCH PURCHASE ORDERS THAT REPRESENT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, AS PURCHASE ORDERS MAY REPRESENT AUTHORIZATIONS TO PURCHASE RATHER THAN BINDING AGREEMENTS. OUR PURCHASE ORDERS ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT MANUFACTURING NEEDS AND ARE FULFILLED BY OUR VENDORS WITHIN RELATIVELY SHORT TIME HORIZONS.

WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN MOBILE APPLICATIONS AND THE MOBILE WORKFORCE ARE RESULTING FROM TECHNICAL ADVANCES IN MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES,  COST REDUCTIONS IN MOBILE DEVICES AND THE GROWING ADOPTION BY BUSINESSES OF MOBILE APPLICATIONS FOR SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS, BUILDING  A GROWING DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. OUR DATA CAPTURE PRODUCTS ADDRESS THE NEED FOR SPEED AND ACCURACY BY TODAY\u2019S MOBILE WORKERS  AND BY THE SYSTEMS SUPPORTING THOSE WORKERS, THEREBY ENHANCING THEIR PRODUCTIVITY AND ALLOWING THEM TO EXPLOIT TIME SENSITIVE  OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.  REVENUES  TOTAL  REVENUE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS APPROXIMATELY $4.6 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF 16% COMPARED TO THE REVENUE OF APPROXIMATELY  $4.0 MILLION FOR THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO. IN DECEMBER 2018, WE COMPLETED THE TRANSITION TO OUR NEW SOCKETSCAN PRODUCTS WHICH  OFFER IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AT SIMILAR OR LOWER PRICING AND ARE WELL ACCEPTED. SALES GROWTH IN Q1 2019 CONTINUES TO BE DRIVEN BY  THE DEPLOYMENT OF BUSINESS APPLICATIONS THAT REQUIRE BARCODE SCANNING. MOBILE POINT OF SALE (MPOS) REMAINS A LARGE AND UNDERSERVED  SMALL BUSINESS MARKET AND IS INCREASINGLY BEING ADDRESSED BY MPOS SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS RUNNING ON IPAD AND ANDROID TABLETS. IN  Q1 2019, WE ALSO EXPERIENCED GROWTH IN MOBILE APPLICATIONS FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES, TRANSPORTATION AND HEALTH CARE.  COMPARED  TO THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO, Q1 2019 REVENUE FROM CUSTOMERS BASED IN THE AMERICAS INCREASED BY 22%, FROM ASIA PACIFIC REGIONS  INCREASED 38%, AND FROM CUSTOMERS BASED IN EUROPE DECREASED BY 23%.  GROSS  MARGINS  OUR  GROSS PROFIT MARGINS FOR THE FIRST QUARTERS OF BOTH 2019 AND 2018 WERE 52%.  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS $894,000, A DECREASE OF 6% COMPARED TO EXPENSES OF $947,000 IN THE SAME  QUARTER A YEAR AGO. DECREASE IN THE LEVEL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PERSONNEL COSTS REFLECTING  HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS IN FEBRUARY 2018. WE EXPECT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE TO INCREASE DURING THE BALANCE OF 2019 DUE TO  HEADCOUNT ADDITIONS TO FACILITATE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND UPDATE.  16  INDEX  SALES  AND MARKETING EXPENSE  SALES  AND MARKETING EXPENSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS $756,000, AN INCREASE OF 2% COMPARED TO EXPENSE OF $738,000 IN THE SAME  QUARTER A YEAR AGO. SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN FLAT FOR THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR.  GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS $703,000, AN INCREASE OF 6% COMPARED TO EXPENSE OF $665,000 IN THE  FIRST QUARTER OF 2018. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO MODERATELY DECLINE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 FROM  THE FIRST QUARTER LEVELS AS THE COSTS OF OUR ANNUAL AUDIT ARE EXPENSED PRIMARILY IN THE FIRST QUARTER, AND TO REMAIN FLAT FOR  THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR.  INTEREST  EXPENSE, NET OF INTEREST INCOME  INTEREST  EXPENSE AND OTHER, NET OF INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER, WAS $29,000 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO $20,000 IN THE FIRST  QUARTER OF 2018. INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2019 WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO INTEREST ON BANK TERM LOAN AND CREDIT LINE FACILITIES (SEE  \u201cNOTE 4 \u2014 BANK FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\u201d FOR MORE INFORMATION). AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF BANK TERM LOAN  AND CREDIT LINES DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 WAS $1.5 MILLION. INTEREST EXPENSE IN Q1 2018 WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO  INTEREST ON THE TERM LOAN BORROWED FOR REPURCHASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. ADDITIONALLY, INTEREST EXPENSE IN EACH OF THE COMPARABLE  FIRST QUARTERS INCLUDES INTEREST ON EQUIPMENT LEASE FINANCING OBLIGATIONS.  INTEREST  INCOME REFLECTS INTEREST EARNED ON CASH BALANCES. INTEREST INCOME WAS NOMINAL IN EACH OF THE COMPARABLE FIRST QUARTERS, REFLECTING  LOW AVERAGE CASH BALANCES COMBINED WITH LOW AVERAGE RATES OF RETURN.  INCOME  TAXES  THE  TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017, EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2018, ELIMINATES ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAXES AND LOWERS THE U.S. FEDERAL  CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 34% TO 21%. CALIFORNIA CORPORATE NET INCOME TAX RATE IS 6.98% AFTER ALLOWING FOR FEDERAL DEDUCTIBILITY.  IN Q1 2019, OUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION OF $121,965 IS THE PRIMARY PERMANENT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FINANCIAL AND TAX EXPENSE WHICH  INCREASED OUR TAXABLE INCOME. WE ESTIMATED OUR FEDERAL AND STATE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO BE 36% IN Q1 2019 AND RECORDED A DEFERRED  TAX EXPENSE OF $6,670. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WE RECORDED A DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT OF $80,000 WITH THE EXPECTATION OF A RETURN  TO PROFITABLE OPERATING RESULTS AND FULL UTILIZATION OF OUR NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS. OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET, PRIMARILY  REPRESENTING FUTURE INCOME TAX SAVINGS FROM THE APPLICATION OF NET OPERATING LOSS CARRY FORWARDS, WAS VALUED AT $5,774,268 AT  MARCH 31, 2019.  WE  HAVE DETERMINED THAT UTILIZATION OF EXISTING NET OPERATING LOSSES AGAINST FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME IS NOT LIMITED BY SECTION 382  OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. FUTURE OWNERSHIP CHANGES, HOWEVER, MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO FULLY UTILIZE THE EXISTING NET OPERATING  LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AGAINST ANY FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE LIKELIHOOD TO REALIZE THE VALUE OF DEFERRED  TAX ASSETS IN THE FUTURE.  17  INDEX  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS  REFLECTED IN OUR STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS, NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $406,000 IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2019, COMPARED  TO NET CASH USED OF $389,000 IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD A YEAR AGO. WE CALCULATE NET CASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  BY INCREASING OUR NET INCOME ($11,839 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019) OR DECREASING OUR NET LOSS ($225,029 IN THE FIRST QUARTER  OF 2018) BY THOSE EXPENSES THAT DID NOT REQUIRE THE USE OF CASH. THESE ITEMS CONSIST OF STOCK BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION  AND AMORTIZATION, AND DEFERRED TAX EXPENSES AND BENEFITS. THESE AMOUNTS TOTALED $229,150 AND $123,600 IN THE FIRST QUARTERS OF  2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, WE REPORT INCREASES IN ASSETS AND REDUCTIONS IN LIABILITIES AS USES OF CASH AND DECREASES  IN ASSETS AND INCREASES IN LIABILITIES AS SOURCES OF CASH, TOGETHER REFERRED TO AS CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  IN  THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTED IN A NET USE OF CASH OF $647,000 AND WERE PRIMARILY  FROM INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE TO HIGHER SHIPMENTS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRST QUARTER AND INCREASES IN INVENTORY LEVELS.  THE USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED INVENTORY PURCHASES. IN  THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTED IN A NET USE OF CASH OF $287,000 PRIMARILY FROM  INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE TO HIGHER SHIPMENTS IN MARCH 2018.  IN  THE FIRST QUARTERS OF 2019 AND 2018, WE INVESTED $100,000 AND $164,000, RESPECTIVELY, IN MANUFACTURING TOOLING COSTS AND COMPUTER  SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS.  NET  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $351,000, COMPARED TO NET CASH USED OF $752,000  IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD A YEAR AGO. FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2019 CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF $480,000 BORROWED ON OUR BANK LINES OF  CREDIT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $125,000 REPAYMENT OF OUR TERM LOAN. FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 CONSISTED PRIMARILY  OF $5.0 MILLION USE OF CASH RELATED TO REPURCHASE OF COMPANY STOCK, $4.0 MILLION PROCEEDS FROM A DRAWDOWN OF OUR TERM LOAN AND  $275,000 PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS.

OF THAT GROWTH, $21,010 WAS FROM THE ACQUISITIONS OF CLEMENT MAY  AND KRI COUPLED WITH  ORGANIC GROWTH OF $2,509.  THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE OF $4,337 FROM DIVESTING OF PEOPLESERVE AND  $1,144  FROM UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  WITHIN ORGANIC GROWTH, TEMPORARY CONTRACTOR REVENUE GREW $2,415 AND PERMANENT PLACEMENT GREW $94.  REVENUE IN Q1 2019 WAS COMPRISED OF $70,998 OF TEMPORARY CONTRACTOR REVENUE AND $2,831 OF PERMANENT PLACEMENT REVENUE, COMPARED WITH $52,997 AND $2,794 FOR Q1 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  DIRECT COST OF REVENUE, GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN  DIRECT COST OF SERVICES INCLUDES THE VARIABLE COST OF LABOR AND VARIOUS NON-VARIABLE COSTS (E.G., WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION INSURANCE) RELATING TO EMPLOYEES (TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT) AS WELL AS SUB-CONTRACTORS AND CONSULTANTS. FOR Q1 2019, DIRECT COST OF REVENUE WAS $61,711, AN INCREASE OF 39.6% FROM $44,210 IN Q1 2018, COMPARED WITH REVENUE GROWTH OF 32.3%.  17  STAFFING 360 SOLUTIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (ALL AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE, PAR VALUES AND STATED VALUES)  GROSS PROFIT FOR Q1 2019 WAS $12,118, AN INCREASE OF 4.6% OVER $11,581 FOR Q1 2018, REPRESENTING GROSS MARGIN OF 16.4% AND 20.8% FOR EACH  PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY.  GROSS PROFIT GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS. THIS WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY  THE  DIVESTITURE OF THE LOWER MARGIN PEOPLESERVE BUSINESS, WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION INSURANCE SAVINGS REALIZED IN  Q1 2018 WITH NO CO  RRESPONDING CREDIT IN Q1 2019, AND MIX WITHIN THE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH.  OPERATING EXPENSES  OPERATING EXPENSES FOR Q1 2019 WERE $11,368, A DECREASE OF 5.2% OVER $11,986 FOR Q1 2018.  THE ACQUISITIONS OF CLEMENT MAY, AND KRI DROVE AN ADDITIONAL INCREASE OF 9.5% IN OPERATING EXPENSE.  EXCLUDING THE ACQUISITIONS, OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED BY 14.7% DRIVEN BY LOWER NON-RECURRING COSTS, LEGAL, AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS, LOWER VARIABLE COSTS AND SAVINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SYNERGIES WITHIN THE SUBSIDIARIES, COST SAVINGS INITIATIVES, AND PEOPLESERVE DIVESTURE.  OTHER EXPENSES  OTHER EXPENSES FOR Q1 2019 WAS $523, A DECREASE OF 26.8% FROM $714 IN Q1 2018. THE DECREASE IS DRIVEN BY THE FOLLOWING: $105 LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE RECORDED IN Q1 2019 VERSUS Q1 2018 DUE TO THE $13 MILLION DEBT CONVERSION IN Q3 2018; $847 GAIN ON SETTLEMENT OF FIRSTPRO DEFERRED CONSIDERATION IN Q1 2019; $36 HIGHER OTHER INCOME DRIVEN MAINLY BY HIGHER INVESTMENT INCOME ON THE COMPANY\u2019S WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION COLLATERAL.  THESE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GAIN OF $538 FROM FAIR VALUING WARRANTS IN Q1 2018, WITH NO CORRESPONDING GAIN IN Q1 2019; $224 OF LOWER GAIN IN Q1 2019 VERSUS Q1 2018 FROM REMEASURING THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERCOMPANY NOTE; $35 OF HIGHER AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AND DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS.  18  STAFFING 360 SOLUTIONS, INC.

WE BELIEVE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND KPIS MAY PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION FOR EVALUATING OUR CASH OPERATING PERFORMANCE, ABILITY TO SERVICE DEBT, COMPLIANCE WITH DEBT COVENANTS AND MEASUREMENT AGAINST COMPETITORS. THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPLEMENTAL IN NATURE AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. IN ADDITION, THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY ENTITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  WE PRESENT THE FOLLOWING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND KPIS IN THIS REPORT.  REVENUE AND GROSS PROFIT BY SECTOR  WE USE THIS KPI TO MEASURE THE COMPANY\u2019S MIX OF REVENUE AND RESPECTIVE PROFITABILITY BETWEEN ITS TWO MAIN LINES OF BUSINESS DUE TO THEIR DIFFERING MARGINS. FOR CLARITY, THESE LINES OF BUSINESS ARE NOT THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING SEGMENTS, AS THIS INFORMATION IS NOT CURRENTLY REGULARLY REVIEWED BY THE CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER TO ALLOCATE CAPITAL AND RESOURCES.

WE USE THIS KPI BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT PROVIDES A MEASURE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFICIENCY FOR CONVERTING INCREMENTAL GROSS PROFIT INTO ADJUSTED EBITDA.

BECAUSE MUCH OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TEMPORARY PAYROLL EXPENSE IS PAID WEEKLY AND IN ADVANCE OF CLIENTS REMITTING PAYMENT FOR INVOICES, OPERATING CASH FLOW IS OFTEN WEAKER IN STAFFING COMPANIES WHERE REVENUE AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE GROWING.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FINANCING IS ESSENTIALLY AN ADVANCE ON CLIENT REMITTANCES AND IS PRIMARILY USED TO FUND TEMPORARY PAYROLL.  AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE THIS MEASURE IS HELPFUL TO INVESTORS AS AN INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY\u2019S UNDERLYING OPERATING CASH FLOW.  ON FEBRUARY 8, 2018, CBS BUTLER, STAFFING 360 SOLUTIONS LIMITED AND THE JM GROUP, ENTERED INTO A NEW ARRANGEMENT WITH HSBC INVOICE FINANCE (UK) LTD (\u201cHSBC\u201d) WHICH PROVIDES FOR HSBC TO PURCHASE THE SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE UP TO AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF \u00a311,500 ACROSS ALL THREE SUBSIDIARIES.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  LIQUIDITY IS THE ABILITY OF A COMPANY TO GENERATE FUNDS TO SUPPORT ITS CURRENT AND FUTURE OPERATIONS, SATISFY ITS OBLIGATIONS, AND OTHERWISE OPERATE ON AN ONGOING BASIS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE FUNDED OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH TERM LOANS, PROMISSORY NOTES, BONDS, CONVERTIBLE NOTES, PRIVATE PLACEMENT OFFERINGS AND SALES OF EQUITY.  OUR PRIMARY USES OF CASH HAVE BEEN FOR PROFESSIONAL FEES RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND FOR THE PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION, BENEFITS AND CONSULTING FEES. THE FOLLOWING TRENDS MAY OCCUR AS THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXECUTE ON ITS STRATEGY.  \u2022  AN INCREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS TO FINANCE ORGANIC GROWTH,  \u2022  ADDITION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND SALES PERSONNEL AS THE BUSINESS GROWS,  \u2022  INCREASES IN ADVERTISING, PUBLIC RELATIONS AND SALES PROMOTIONS FOR EXISTING AND NEW BRANDS AS WE EXPAND WITHIN EXISTING MARKETS OR ENTER NEW MARKETS,  \u2022  A CONTINUATION OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BEING A PUBLIC COMPANY, AND  \u2022  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO ADD TECHNOLOGIES.  OUR LIQUIDITY MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PUBLIC COMPANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH NEWLY APPLICABLE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 AND OTHER RULES IMPLEMENTED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. WE EXPECT ALL OF THESE APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR LEGAL AND FINANCIAL COMPLIANCE COSTS AND INCREASE THE USE OF RESOURCES.  AS OF AND FOR THE PERIOD ENDED MARCH 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIENCY OF $13,421, AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $71,414, AND A NET GAIN OF $229.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-02, \u201cLEASES\u201d (TOPIC 842).  THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 30, 2018. UNDER THE NEW PROVISIONS, ALL LESSEES WILL REPORT A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND A LIABILITY FOR THE OBLIGATION TO MAKE PAYMENTS FOR ALL LEASES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THOSE LEASES WITH A TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS.  ALL OTHER LEASES WILL FALL INTO ONE OF TWO CATEGORIES: (I) FINANCING LEASES, SIMILAR TO CAPITAL LEASES, WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE RECOGNITION OF AN ASSET AND LIABILITY, MEASURED AT THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE LEASE PAYMENTS AND (II) OPERATING LEASES WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE RECOGNITION OF AN ASSET AND LIABILITY MEASURED AT THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE LEASE PAYMENTS. LESSOR ACCOUNTING REMAINS SUBSTANTIALLY UNCHANGED WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT NO LEASES ENTERED INTO AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE WILL BE CLASSIFIED AS LEVERAGED LEASES. FOR SALE LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS, THE SALE WILL ONLY BE RECOGNIZED IF THE CRITERIA IN THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD ARE MET. THE NEW STANDARD PROVIDES A NUMBER OF OPTIONAL PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS IN TRANSITION. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO APPLY THE \u2018PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS\u2019 WHICH ALLOW US TO NOT REASSESS I) WHETHER EXISTING OR EXPIRED ARRANGEMENTS CONTAIN A LEASE, II) THE LEASE CLASSIFICATION OF EXISTING OR EXPIRED LEASES, OR III) WHETHER PREVIOUS INITIAL DIRECT COSTS WOULD QUALIFY FOR CAPITALIZATION UNDER THE NEW LEASE STANDARD.

WE SERVICE THE COMMERCIAL SELF-GENERATION ENERGY MARKET IN CALIFORNIA, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT THE RESIDENTIAL SOLAR PV MARKET MARKETPLACE. WE PROVIDE PROJECT ASSESSMENT AND INSTALLATION SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY SELECTION, SYSTEM ENGINEERING, PROCUREMENT, PERMITTING, CONSTRUCTION, GRID CONNECTION, WARRANTY SERVICE, SYSTEM MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE. WE OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF ENERGY PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES, DESIGN OUR SYSTEMS IN-HOUSE TO ENSURE THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEMS WE DELIVER MATCH THE FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS, AND OUR FULL-TIME PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND LICENSED ASSEMBLY CREWS ENSURE A SEAMLESS PROCESS, FROM START TO FINISH.

WE GUIDE OUR PERFORMANCE BY STRIVING TO DELIVER CONSISTENTLY ON THE FOLLOWING CORE OBJECTIVES.  \u25cf COMMITMENT \u2013  TO KEEPING THE CUSTOMER\u2019S BEST INTERESTS AT THE FOREFRONT AT ALL TIMES; AND,  \u25cf VALUE \u2013  THROUGH A FOCUS  ON PERFORMANCE AND FOLLOW THROUGH THAT MEETS OR EXCEEDS CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) DEFINES \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d AS THOSE THAT REQUIRE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND MAY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. NOT ALL OF THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS OR ESTIMATES. HOWEVER, THE FOLLOWING POLICIES COULD BE DEEMED TO BE CRITICAL WITHIN THE SEC DEFINITION.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN SERVICES ARE PERFORMED, AND AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT OF PRODUCTS, PROVIDED THAT EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, FEES ARE FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION OF THE RELATED RECEIVABLE IS REASONABLY ASSURED.

ALL UN-ALLOCABLE INDIRECT COSTS AND CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO THE PERIODS AS INCURRED. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT A LOSS ON A CONTRACT IS FORESEEN, THE COMPANY WILL RECOGNIZE THE LOSS AS IT IS DETERMINED.  USE OF ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES INCLUDE ESTIMATES USED TO REVIEW THE COMPANY\u2019S ESTIMATIONS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, REVENUE RECOGNITION ON PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION TYPE CONTRACTS, ALLOWANCES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS, VALUATION OF NON-CASH CAPITAL STOCK ISSUANCES AND THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE COMPANY BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE FAIR VALUE INFORMATION, WHETHER OR NOT RECOGNIZED IN THE BALANCE SHEET, WHERE IT IS PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THAT VALUE. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR CASH, PREPAID EXPENSES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES APPROXIMATE THE FAIR VALUE BECAUSE OF THEIR SHORT MATURITIES.

CORPORATE  HISTORY  ON  NOVEMBER 20, 2009, THE COMPANY, FORMERLY KNOWN AS WOLFE CREEK MINING, INC., ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (THE  \u201cMERGER AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH GREEN ENVIROTECH ACQUISITION CORP., A NEVADA CORPORATION, AND GREEN ENVIROTECH CORP. ON JULY  20, 2010, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS NAME TO GREEN ENVIROTECH HOLDINGS CORP.  OVERVIEW  OF OUR BUSINESS  GREEN  ENVIROTECH HOLDING CORP. (OTC:PINK:GETH) IS FIRST AND FOREMOST A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY. OUR MISSION IS TO FIND, DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT  PRACTICAL, ECONOMICAL SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION OF WASTE, ENERGY, WATER AND FOOD;  AND TO CREATE JOBS AND STIMULATE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES WHERE WE OPERATE AS WE STRIVE TO ACHIEVE THIS MISSION.  OUR  FIRST MARKET WILL BE TO PROCESS END OF LIFE TIRES, STARTING IN THE USA. OUR GEN 1 END OF LIFE TIRE PROCESSING SOLUTION IS READY  FOR DEPLOYMENT AND WE ARE WORKING TO SECURE OUR FIRST PROJECT FINANCE FACILITY THAT WILL BE USED TO BUILD A CARBON FINISHING PLANT  (CFP) AND BUILD TWO, GEN 1 END OF LIFE TIRE PROCESSING PLANTS. WHETHER OR NOT THE CFP WILL BE A STANDALONE FACILITY OR COMBINED  WITH GEN 1 END OF LIFE TIRE PROCESSING PLANT IS STILL TO BE DETERMINED. WHEN FULLY OPERATIONAL, WE EXPECT THESE PLANTS TO PROCESS  100,000 TONS PER YEAR OF END OF LIFE TIRES AND GENERATE MORE THAN $40 MILLION OF ANNUAL REVENUE.  18  OUR  GOAL OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS (BY 2024) IS TO BE PROCESSING 15-20% OF THE END OF LIFE TIRE FEEDSTOCK IN THE USA, WHICH WOULD GENERATE  MORE THAN $200 MILLION IN ANNUAL REVENUES, MAKING GETH THE MARKET LEADER IN THE USA. IN ORDER TO KEEP UP WITH OUR FIVE YEAR BUILDING  PROGRAM, WE EXPECT TO BE COMMISSIONING NUMEROUS TIRE PROCESSING PLANTS IN A NUMBER OF STRATEGIC LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.  WITH OUR EXPANSION PROGRAM, WE INTEND TO CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL FINISHING LINES AT OUR CARBON FINISHING PLANT, WHICH IS TO BE DETERMINED.  ACHIEVING OUR GOAL WOULD MEAN THAT OVER 800,000 TONS OF END-OF-LIFE TIRES WILL BE DIVERTED FROM LANDFILLS. WE SEE OUR EXPANSION  PROGRAM CREATING HUNDREDS OF JOBS, OFTEN IN AREAS OF LOW EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY.  RECENT  DEVELOPMENTS  OVER  THE LAST YEAR AND THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019, WE HAVE BEEN PUSHING THROUGH THE SLOWED PROGRESS WHICH WAS A RESULT OF STALLED  FUNDING WE INCURRED IN 2017 AND 2018. OUR FOCUS IS TO SECURE FUNDING TO BUILD THE CARBON FINISHING PLANT AND A TIRE PROCESSING  PLANT OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH AS ONE UNIT. THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE PROGRESSING GOING FORWARD, BUT WE HAVE NOT SIGNED A DEFINITIVE  AGREEMENT TO FINANCE A PROCESSING PLANT TO DATE. AS A RESULT, THE EXECUTION OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN HAS SLIPPED BY SEVERAL MONTHS,  AND WE NOW FORECAST THE CARBON FINISHING PLANT, FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019, WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN AN INVESTMENT MODE FOR WHICH  WE ANTICIPATE THESE INVESTMENTS TO GENERATE REVENUES STARTING IN LATE 2019 AND/OR INTO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. THE GOAL IS  TO REACH OUR FORECASTED REVENUE OF $1 MILLION TO $2 MILLION IN 2020, AND AN ESTIMATED $15 MILLION IN RECURRING REVENUES FROM 2021  ONWARDS.  MANAGEMENT  INTENDS TO FINANCE OPERATING COSTS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS WITH CREDIT LINES, LOANS AND/OR PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF COMMON STOCK.  ON  MARCH 27, 2018, OUR CEO, SECRETARY AND TREASURER AND FOUR MANAGERS, AGREED TO WAIVE PAYMENT OF THEIR ACCRUED SALARIES THAT WERE  OUTSTANDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WHICH WAS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CONTRIBUTION TO EQUITY.  ON  MARCH 8, 2018, WE FILED WITH THE STATE OF DELAWARE, DIVISION OF CORPORATIONS, A CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS OF PREFERENCES, RIGHTS  AND LIMITATIONS FOR 300,000 SHARES OF A SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK. THESE SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES ARE  SENIOR TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS IN REFERENCE TO LIQUIDATION DIVIDENDS AND ARE JUNIOR TO THE SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES.  THE SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES HAVE AN ANNUAL 12% DIVIDEND AND HAVE NO VOTING RIGHTS. THE REDEMPTION OPTIONS FOR THESE  SHARES ARE 105% FOR THE FIRST 30 DAYS, 110% FOR THE FIRST 60 DAYS, 115% FOR THE FIRST 90 DAYS, 120% FOR THE FIRST 120 DAYS, 125%  FOR THE FIRST 150 DAYS AND 130% FOR THE FIRST 180 DAYS, THEN AFTER NO REDEMPTION RIGHTS. TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE ISSUE DATE, THE  COMPANY HAS A \u201cMANDATORY REDEMPTION DATE\u201d TO REDEEM THE OUTSTANDING SHARES NOT CONVERTED. THE SHARES HAVE CONVERSION  RIGHTS TO CONVERT AT 75% OF THE AVERAGE OF THE TWO LOWEST COMMON STOCK PRICES TEN DAYS BEFORE THE DATE OF CONVERSION. AS OF THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD 47,300 SHARES OF OUT SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK OUTSTANDING. THESE SHARES  WERE ADDED BACK TO THE TREASURY ON APRIL 16, 2019 WHEN THE COMPANY BOUGHT THEM BACK.  ON  OCTOBER 10, 2018, THE COMPANY HELD A MEETING WITH SHAREHOLDERS CONCERNING ITS PROXY STATEMENT REQUESTING SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 APPROVAL  TO EXTEND THE AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES OF THE COMPANY FROM 250,000,000 TO 750,000,000. IT WAS APPROVED. THE COMPANY AT THE TIME  OF THE APPROVAL HAD OUTSTANDING 48,609,224 COMMON SHARES AND NEEDED APPROVAL FROM 24,304,613 SHAREHOLDERS TO PROCEED. THE PROXY  STATEMENT WAS APPROVED BY THE SHAREHOLDERS AND THE CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT WAS STAMPED APPROVED BY THE STATE OF DELAWARE ON OCTOBER  12, 2018.  ON  JANUARY 24, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD VOTED ON AND APPROVED WHAT IT HAD DETERMINED TO BE ITS PRESENT OUTSTANDING STOCK CONDITION  IN THE MARKET. THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK WAS MOVING AT SUCH A CONVERSION SPEED BY CERTAIN NOTE HOLDERS TO THE POINT THE COMPANY  WAS GOING TO BE UNABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE RESERVE SHARES REQUIREMENT FROM ITS UNISSUED SHARES. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL  RESOURCES TO REPAY THE NOTE HOLDERS AT THIS TIME NOR ENOUGH TIME TO FACILITATE NEW FUNDING TO STOP THE CONVERSIONS WHICH CONTINUES  TO LOWER THE PRICE OF THE STOCK IN THE MARKET WHICH INCREASES THE RESERVES NEEDED TO SUPPLY THE CONVERSIONS. THE COMPANY\u2019S  750,000,000 AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARES WOULD BE CONSUMED RAPIDLY IF SOMETHING IS NOT ACCOMPLISHED. THEREFORE, IT WAS IN THE CONSENSUS  OF THE BOARD TO RECOMMEND THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS AUTHORIZE A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT TO INCREASE THE PRICE OF THE STOCK IN THE MARKET  AND TO REDUCE THE SHARES OUTSTANDING. ACCORDINGLY, THE BOARD RECOMMENDED THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS ACT TO AUTHORIZE THE BOARD TO EFFECT  A REVERSE SPLIT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK IN ANY AMOUNT UP TO 200 TO ONE AT ANY TIME WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE DATE OF  THIS AUTHORIZATION, AT THE BOARD\u2019S DISCRETION. THE COMPANY\u2019S SHAREHOLDERS, ACTING BY MAJORITY WRITTEN CONSENT, ACTED  ON JANUARY 24, 2019, TO AUTHORIZE THE BOARD TO IMPLEMENT THE REVERSE SPLIT ON THOSE TERMS. PRESENTLY, THE BOARD HAS NOT VOTED ON WHEN THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT WILL TAKE PLACE, NOR HAS THE COMPANY FILED  A PRELIMINARY 14C WITH THE SEC.  19  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICY AND ESTIMATES  OUR  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION DISCUSSES OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION  OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING  PERIOD. ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION,  ACCRUED EXPENSES, FINANCING OPERATIONS, AND CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL  EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM  THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.  ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  INHERENT IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE ESTIMATES AS TO THE APPROPRIATE CARRYING VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES WHICH ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS  YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TOGETHER WITH OUR  UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE  RELATED NOTES APPEARING ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, AND TOGETHER WITH  OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, RELATED NOTES AND  \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR  ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K, FILED WITH THE SEC ON APRIL 1, 2019.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE  A SHOCK WAVE TECHNOLOGY  COMPANY  USING A PATENTED SYSTEM OF NONINVASIVE, HIGH-ENERGY, ACOUSTIC SHOCK  WAVES FOR REGENERATIVE MEDICINE AND OTHER APPLICATIONS. OUR INITIAL  FOCUS IS REGENERATIVE MEDICINE \u2013 UTILIZING NONINVASIVE,  ACOUSTIC SHOCK WAVES TO PRODUCE A BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE RESULTING IN  THE BODY HEALING ITSELF THROUGH THE REPAIR AND REGENERATION OF  TISSUE, MUSCULOSKELETAL AND VASCULAR STRUCTURES OUR LEAD  REGENERATIVE PRODUCT IN THE UNITED STATES IS THE  DERMAPACE  \u00ae  DEVICE, USED  FOR TREATING DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS, WHICH WAS SUBJECT TO TWO  DOUBLE-BLINDED, RANDOMIZED PHASE III CLINICAL STUDIES AND WAS  CLEARED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\"FDA\") ON  DECEMBER 28, 2017.  OUR  PORTFOLIO OF HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES ACTIVATE  BIOLOGIC SIGNALING AND ANGIOGENIC RESPONSES, INCLUDING NEW  VASCULARIZATION AND MICROCIRCULATORY IMPROVEMENT, HELPING TO  RESTORE THE BODY\u2019S NORMAL HEALING PROCESSES AND REGENERATION.  WE INTEND TO APPLY OUR PULSED ACOUSTIC CELLULAR EXPRESSION  (PACE  \u00ae  ) TECHNOLOGY IN  WOUND HEALING, ORTHOPEDIC, PLASTIC/COSMETIC AND CARDIAC CONDITIONS.  IN 2018, WE STARTED MARKETING OUR DERMAPACE SYSTEM FOR SALE IN THE  UNITED STATES AND WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM SALES OF  THE EUROPEAN CONFORMITY MARKING (CE MARK) DEVICES AND ACCESSORIES  IN EUROPE, CANADA, ASIA AND ASIA/PACIFIC.  OUR  LEAD PRODUCT CANDIDATE FOR THE GLOBAL WOUND CARE MARKET, DERMAPACE,  HAS RECEIVED FDA CLEARANCE FOR COMMERCIAL USE TO TREAT DIABETIC  FOOT ULCERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE CE MARK ALLOWING FOR  COMMERCIAL USE ON ACUTE AND CHRONIC DEFECTS OF THE SKIN AND  SUBCUTANEOUS SOFT TISSUE. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT OUR  PATENTED TECHNOLOGY IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE IN STIMULATING HEALING IN  CHRONIC CONDITIONS OF THE FOOT AND THE ELBOW THROUGH OUR UNITED  STATES FDA CLASS III PMA APPROVED OSSATRON  \u00ae  DEVICE, AND IN  THE STIMULATION OF BONE AND CHRONIC TENDONITIS REGENERATION IN THE  MUSCULOSKELETAL ENVIRONMENT THROUGH THE UTILIZATION OF OUR  ORTHOPACE  \u00ae  , OSSATRON, AND  EVOTRON  \u00ae  DEVICES IN  EUROPE AND ASIA.  WE  ARE FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING OUR PULSED ACOUSTIC CELLULAR EXPRESSION  (PACE) TECHNOLOGY TO ACTIVATE HEALING IN.  \u25cf  WOUND  CONDITIONS, INCLUDING DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS, VENOUS AND ARTERIAL  ULCERS, PRESSURE SORES, BURNS AND OTHER SKIN ERUPTION  CONDITIONS;  \u25cf  ORTHOPEDIC  APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS ELIMINATING CHRONIC PAIN IN JOINTS FROM  TRAUMA, ARTHRITIS OR TENDONS/LIGAMENTS INFLAMMATION, SPEEDING THE  HEALING OF FRACTURES (INCLUDING NONUNION OR DELAYED-UNION  CONDITIONS), IMPROVING BONE DENSITY IN OSTEOPOROSIS, FUSING BONES  IN THE EXTREMITIES AND SPINE, AND OTHER POTENTIAL SPORTS INJURY  APPLICATIONS;  \u25cf  PLASTIC/COSMETIC  APPLICATIONS SUCH AS CELLULITE SMOOTHING, GRAFT AND TRANSPLANT  ACCEPTANCE, SKIN TIGHTENING, SCARRING AND OTHER POTENTIAL AESTHETIC  USES; AND  \u25cf  CARDIAC  APPLICATIONS FOR REMOVING PLAQUE DUE TO ATHEROSCLEROSIS IMPROVING  HEART MUSCLE PERFORMANCE.  IN  ADDITION TO HEALTHCARE USES, OUR HIGH-ENERGY, ACOUSTIC PRESSURE  SHOCK WAVES, DUE TO THEIR POWERFUL PRESSURE GRADIENTS AND LOCALIZED  CAVITATIONAL EFFECTS, MAY HAVE APPLICATIONS IN SECONDARY AND  TERTIARY OIL EXPLOITATION, FOR CLEANING INDUSTRIAL WATERS AND FOOD  LIQUIDS AND FINALLY FOR MAINTENANCE OF INDUSTRIAL INSTALLATIONS BY  DISRUPTING BIOFILMS FORMATION. OUR BUSINESS APPROACH WILL BE  THROUGH LICENSING AND/OR PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES.  19  CLINICAL TRIALS AND MARKETING  THE FDA  GRANTED APPROVAL OF OUR INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE EXEMPTION (IDE) TO  CONDUCT TWO DOUBLE-BLINDED, RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS UTILIZING  OUR LEAD DEVICE PRODUCT FOR THE GLOBAL WOUND CARE MARKET, THE  DERMAPACE DEVICE, IN THE TREATMENT OF DIABETIC FOOT  ULCERS.  THE  DERMAPACE SYSTEM WAS EVALUATED USING TWO STUDIES UNDER IDE G070103.  THE STUDIES WERE DESIGNED AS PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND,  PARALLEL-GROUP, SHAM-CONTROLLED, MULTI-CENTER 24-WEEK STUDIES AT 39  CENTERS. A TOTAL OF 336 SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED AND TREATED WITH  EITHER DERMAPACE PLUS CONVENTIONAL THERAPY OR CONVENTIONAL THERAPY  (A.K.A. STANDARD OF CARE) ALONE. CONVENTIONAL THERAPY INCLUDED, BUT  WAS NOT LIMITED TO, DEBRIDEMENT, SALINE-MOISTENED GAUZE, AND  PRESSURE REDUCING FOOTWEAR. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDIES WAS TO  COMPARE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE DERMAPACE DEVICE TO  SHAM-CONTROL APPLICATION. THE PROSPECTIVELY DEFINED PRIMARY  EFFICACY ENDPOINT FOR THE DERMAPACE STUDIES WAS THE INCIDENCE OF  COMPLETE WOUND CLOSURE AT 12 WEEKS POST-INITIAL APPLICATION OF THE  DERMAPACE SYSTEM (ACTIVE OR SHAM). COMPLETE WOUND CLOSURE WAS  DEFINED AS SKIN RE-EPITHELIALIZATION WITHOUT DRAINAGE OR DRESSING  REQUIREMENTS, CONFIRMED OVER TWO CONSECUTIVE VISITS WITHIN  12-WEEKS. IF THE WOUND WAS CONSIDERED CLOSED FOR THE FIRST TIME AT  THE 12 WEEK VISIT, THEN THE NEXT VISIT WAS USED TO CONFIRM CLOSURE.  INVESTIGATORS CONTINUED TO FOLLOW SUBJECTS AND EVALUATE WOUND  CLOSURE THROUGH 24 WEEKS.  THE DERMAPACE DEVICE COMPLETED ITS INITIAL PHASE  III, IDE CLINICAL TRIAL IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE TREATMENT OF  DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS IN 2011 AND A PMA APPLICATION WAS FILED WITH  THE FDA IN JULY 2011.  THE PATIENT ENROLLMENT FOR THE SECOND,  SUPPLEMENTAL CLINICAL TRIAL BEGAN IN JUNE 2013. WE COMPLETED  ENROLLMENT FOR THE 130 PATIENTS IN THIS SECOND TRIAL IN NOVEMBER  2014 AND SUSPENDED FURTHER ENROLLMENT AT THAT TIME.  THE  ONLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO STUDIES WAS THE NUMBER  OF APPLICATIONS OF THE DERMAPACE DEVICE. STUDY ONE (DERM01; N=206)  PRESCRIBED FOUR (4) DEVICE APPLICATIONS/TREATMENTS OVER A TWO-WEEK  PERIOD, WHEREAS, STUDY TWO (DERM02; N=130) PRESCRIBED UP TO EIGHT  (8) DEVICE APPLICATIONS (4 WITHIN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF  RANDOMIZATION, AND 1 TREATMENT EVERY TWO WEEKS THEREAFTER UP TO A  TOTAL OF 8 TREATMENTS OVER A 10-WEEK PERIOD). IF THE WOUND WAS  DETERMINED CLOSED BY THE PI DURING THE TREATMENT REGIMEN, ANY  FURTHER PLANNED APPLICATIONS WERE NOT PERFORMED.  BETWEEN  THE TWO STUDIES THERE WERE OVER 336 PATIENTS EVALUATED, WITH 172  PATIENTS TREATED WITH DERMAPACE AND 164 CONTROL GROUP SUBJECTS WITH  USE OF A NON-FUNCTIONAL DEVICE (SHAM). BOTH TREATMENT GROUPS  RECEIVED WOUND CARE CONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARD OF CARE IN  ADDITION TO DEVICE APPLICATION. STUDY SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED USING  PRE-DETERMINED INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A  HOMOGENOUS STUDY POPULATION WITH CHRONIC DIABETES AND A DIABETIC  FOOT ULCER THAT HAS PERSISTED A MINIMUM OF 30 DAYS AND ITS AREA IS  BETWEEN 1CM  2  AND 16CM  2  , INCLUSIVE. SUBJECTS  WERE ENROLLED AT VISIT 1 AND FOLLOWED FOR A RUN-IN PERIOD OF TWO  WEEKS. AT TWO WEEKS (VISIT 2 \u2013 DAY 0), THE FIRST TREATMENT  WAS APPLIED (EITHER DERMAPACE OR SHAM CONTROL APPLICATION).  APPLICATIONS WITH EITHER DERMAPACE OR SHAM CONTROL WERE THEN MADE  AT DAY 3 (VISIT 3), DAY 6 (VISIT 4), AND DAY 9 (VISIT 5) WITH THE  POTENTIAL FOR 4 ADDITIONAL TREATMENTS IN STUDY 2. SUBJECT PROGRESS  INCLUDING WOUND SIZE WAS THEN OBSERVED ON A BI-WEEKLY BASIS FOR UP  TO 24 WEEKS AT A TOTAL OF 12 VISITS (WEEKS 2-24; VISITS  6-17).  A TOTAL  OF 336 PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED IN THE DERMAPACE STUDIES AT 37 SITES.  THE PATIENTS IN THE STUDIES WERE FOLLOWED FOR A TOTAL OF 24 WEEKS.  THE STUDIES\u2019 PRIMARY ENDPOINT, WOUND CLOSURE, WAS DEFINED AS  \u201cSUCCESSFUL\u201d IF THE SKIN WAS 100% RE-EPITHELIALIZED AT  12 WEEKS WITHOUT DRAINAGE OR DRESSING REQUIREMENTS CONFIRMED AT TWO  CONSECUTIVE STUDY VISITS.  A  SUMMARY OF THE KEY STUDY FINDINGS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  \u25cf  PATIENTS TREATED  WITH DERMAPACE SHOWED A STRONG POSITIVE TREND IN THE PRIMARY  ENDPOINT OF 100% WOUND CLOSURE. TREATMENT WITH DERMAPACE INCREASED  THE PROPORTION OF DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS THAT CLOSED WITHIN 12 WEEKS,  ALTHOUGH THE RATE OF COMPLETE WOUND CLOSURE BETWEEN DERMAPACE AND  SHAM-CONTROL AT 12 WEEKS IN THE INTENTION-TO-TREAT (ITT) POPULATION  WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AT THE 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL USED  THROUGHOUT THE STUDY (P=0.320). THERE WERE 39 OUT OF 172 (22.67%)  DERMAPACE SUBJECTS WHO ACHIEVED COMPLETE WOUND CLOSURE AT 12 WEEKS  COMPARED WITH 30 OUT OF 164 (18.29%) SHAM-CONTROL  SUBJECTS.  \u25cf  IN ADDITION TO THE  ORIGINALLY PROPOSED 12-WEEK EFFICACY ANALYSIS, AND IN CONJUNCTION  WITH THE FDA AGREEMENT TO ANALYZE THE EFFICACY ANALYSIS CARRIED  OVER THE FULL 24 WEEKS OF THE STUDY, WE CONDUCTED A SERIES OF  SECONDARY ANALYSES OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT OF COMPLETE WOUND  CLOSURE AT 12 WEEKS AND AT EACH SUBSEQUENT STUDY VISIT OUT TO 24  WEEKS. THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT OF COMPLETE WOUND CLOSURE  REACHED STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE AT 20 WEEKS IN THE ITT POPULATION  WITH 61 (35.47%) DERMAPACE SUBJECTS ACHIEVING COMPLETE WOUND  CLOSURE COMPARED WITH 40 (24.39%) OF SHAM-CONTROL SUBJECTS  (P=0.027). AT THE 24 WEEK ENDPOINT, THE RATE OF WOUND CLOSURE IN  THE DERMAPACE\u00ae COHORT WAS 37.8% COMPARED TO 26.2% FOR THE  CONTROL GROUP, RESULTING IN A P-VALUE OF 0.023.  20  \u25cf  WITHIN 6 WEEKS  FOLLOWING THE INITIAL DERMAPACE TREATMENT, AND CONSISTENTLY  THROUGHOUT THE 24-WEEK PERIOD, DERMAPACE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE  SIZE OF THE TARGET ULCER COMPARED WITH SUBJECTS RANDOMIZED TO  RECEIVE SHAM-CONTROL (P<0.05).  \u25cf  THE PROPORTION OF  PATIENTS WITH WOUND CLOSURE INDICATE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DERMAPACE AND THE CONTROL GROUP IN THE  PROPORTION OF SUBJECTS WITH THE TARGET-ULCER NOT CLOSED OVER THE  COURSE OF THE STUDY (P-VALUE=0.0346). APPROXIMATELY 25% OF  DERMAPACE\u00ae SUBJECTS REACHED WOUND CLOSURE PER THE STUDY  DEFINITION BY DAY 84 (WEEK 12). THE SAME PERCENTAGE IN THE CONTROL  GROUP (25%) DID NOT REACH WOUND CLOSURE UNTIL DAY 112 (WEEK 16).  THESE DATA INDICATE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE PROPORTION OF SUBJECTS  REACHING WOUND CLOSURE BEING HIGHER IN THE DERMAPACE\u00ae GROUP,  SUBJECTS ARE ALSO REACHING WOUND CLOSURE AT A FASTER RATE WHEN  DERMAPACE IS APPLIED.  \u25cf  DERMAPACE  DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR RESULTS IN THE PREVENTION OF WOUND EXPANSION  (\u2265 10% INCREASE IN WOUND SIZE), WHEN COMPARED TO THE CONTROL,  OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY AT 12 WEEKS (18.0% VERSUS 31.1%;  P=0.005, RESPECTIVELY).  \u25cf  AT 12 AND 24 WEEKS,  THE DERMAPACE GROUP HAD A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF SUBJECTS WITH A 50%  WOUND REDUCTION COMPARED TO THE CONTROL (P=0.0554 AND P=0.0899,  RESPECTIVELY). BOTH TIME POINTS DEMONSTRATE A TREND TOWARDS  STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE.  \u25cf  THE MEAN WOUND  REDUCTION FOR DERMAPACE SUBJECTS AT 24 WEEKS WAS 2.10CM2 COMPARED  TO 0.83CM2 IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY  SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WOUND AREA REDUCTIONS OF THE TWO  COHORTS FROM THE 6 WEEK FOLLOW-UP VISIT THROUGH THE END OF THE  STUDY.  \u25cf  OF THE SUBJECTS WHO  ACHIEVED COMPLETE WOUND CLOSURE AT 12 WEEKS, THE RECURRENCE RATE AT  24 WEEKS WAS ONLY 7.7% IN THE DERMAPACE GROUP COMPARED WITH 11.6%  IN THE SHAM-CONTROL GROUP.  \u25cf  IMPORTANTLY, THERE  WERE NO MEANINGFUL STATISTICAL DIFFERENCES IN THE ADVERSE EVENT  RATES BETWEEN THE DERMAPACE TREATED PATIENTS AND THE SHAM-CONTROL  GROUP. THERE WERE NO ISSUES REGARDING THE TOLERABILITY OF THE  TREATMENT WHICH SUGGESTS THAT A SECOND COURSE OF TREATMENT, IF  NEEDED, IS A CLINICALLY VIABLE OPTION.  WE  RETAINED MUSCULOSKELETAL CLINICAL REGULATORY ADVISERS, LLC (MCRA)  IN JANUARY 2015 TO LEAD THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERACTIONS AND  CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE FDA FOR THE DERMAPACE, WHICH HAVE ALREADY  COMMENCED. MCRA HAS SUCCESSFULLY WORKED WITH THE FDA ON NUMEROUS  PREMARKET APPROVALS (PMAS) FOR VARIOUS MUSCULOSKELETAL, RESTORATIVE  AND GENERAL SURGICAL DEVICES SINCE 2006.  WORKING  WITH MCRA, WE SUBMITTED TO FDA A  DE NOVO  PETITION ON JULY 23, 2016. DUE  TO THE STRONG SAFETY PROFILE OF OUR DEVICE AND THE EFFICACY OF THE  DATA SHOWING STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR WOUND CLOSURE FOR  DERMAPACE SUBJECTS AT 20 WEEKS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE DERMAPACE  DEVICE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR CLASSIFICATION INTO CLASS II AS  THERE IS NO LEGALLY MARKETED PREDICATE DEVICE AND THERE IS NOT AN  EXISTING CLASS III CLASSIFICATION REGULATION OR ONE OR MORE  APPROVED PMAS (WHICH WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A RECLASSIFICATION UNDER  SECTION 513(E) OR (F)(3) OF THE FD&C ACT). ON DECEMBER 28,  2017, THE FDA DETERMINED THAT THE CRITERIA AT SECTION 513(A)(1)(A)  OF (B) OF THE FD&C ACT WERE MET AND GRANTED THE  DE NOVO  CLEARANCE CLASSIFYING DERMAPACE  AS CLASS II AND AVAILABLE TO BE MARKETED IMMEDIATELY.  FINALLY, OUR  DERMAPACE DEVICE HAS RECEIVED THE EUROPEAN CE MARK APPROVAL TO  TREAT ACUTE AND CHRONIC DEFECTS OF THE SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS SOFT  TISSUE, SUCH AS IN THE TREATMENT OF PRESSURE ULCERS, DIABETIC FOOT  ULCERS, BURNS, AND TRAUMATIC AND SURGICAL WOUNDS. THE DERMAPACE IS  ALSO LICENSED FOR SALE IN CANADA, AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND AND SOUTH  KOREA.  WE ARE  ACTIVELY MARKETING THE DERMAPACE TO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, CANADA  AND ASIA/PACIFIC, UTILIZING DISTRIBUTORS IN SELECT  COUNTRIES.  CLINICAL STUDIES  A  DOSAGE STUDY HAS BEEN DEVELOPED FOR LAUNCH IN POLAND TO OPTIMIZE  DERMAPACE SYSTEM TREATMENT DOSAGE FOR PRODUCING A MORE RAPID  REDUCTION IN SIZE OF A DIABETIC FOOT ULCER  (\u201cDFU\u201d).  THE FOCUS WILL BE ON INCREASING THE  NUMBER OF SHOCK WAVES DELIVERED PER TREATMENT, AS A FUNCTION OF  DFUS AREA.  TO DETERMINE THE DOSAGE NECESSARY, THREE NEW  DISTINCTIVE REGIMENS WILL BE ASSESSED DURING THE STUDY.  THIS  STUDY STARTED IN APRIL 2019 AND IS EXPECTED TO BE FINALIZED LATE IN  THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019.  A  POST-MARKET PILOT STUDY TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF HIGH ENERGY  ACOUSTIC SHOCK WAVE THERAPY ON LOCAL SKIN PERFUSION AND HEALING OF  DFUS WILL BE CONDUCTED AT TWO SITES: ONE IN NEW JERSEY AND ONE IN  CALIFORNIA. THE INTENT OF THIS TRIAL IS TO QUANTIFY THE LEVEL OF  INCREASED PERFUSION AND OXYGENATION DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT WITH  THE DERMAPACE SYSTEM. ENROLLMENT AND FIRST PATIENT TREATMENT  STARTED IN APRIL 2019.  21  FINANCIAL OVERVIEW  SINCE  OUR INCEPTION, WE HAVE INCURRED LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS EACH YEAR.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF  $117,520,434. ALTHOUGH THE SIZE AND TIMING OF OUR FUTURE OPERATING  LOSSES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY, WE ANTICIPATE THAT  OUR OPERATING LOSSES WILL CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS WE  INCUR EXPENSES RELATED TO COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR DERMAPACE SYSTEM  FOR THE TREATMENT OF DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS IN THE UNITED STATES. IF  WE ARE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZE, MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE  THE DERMAPACE SYSTEM, WE HOPE TO PARTIALLY OR COMPLETELY OFFSET  THESE LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.  OUR  OPERATING LOSSES CREATE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO  CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. ALTHOUGH NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN,  WE BELIEVE THAT POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES OF EQUITY, DEBT OR  OTHER POTENTIAL FINANCING WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FUNDING FOR US  TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN FOR THE NEXT YEAR. SEE  \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d FOR FURTHER  INFORMATION REGARDING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  WE  CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE NATURE, TIMING AND COSTS OF THE  EFFORTS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL OF, OR  THE PERIOD IN WHICH MATERIAL NET CASH FLOWS ARE EXPECTED TO BE  GENERATED FROM, ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS, DUE TO THE NUMEROUS RISKS AND  UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPING AND MARKETING PRODUCTS,  INCLUDING THE UNCERTAINTY OF.  \u25cf  THE SCOPE, RATE OF  PROGRESS AND COST OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS;  \u25cf  FUTURE CLINICAL  TRIAL RESULTS;  \u25cf  THE COST AND TIMING  OF REGULATORY APPROVALS;  \u25cf  THE ESTABLISHMENT  OF SUCCESSFUL MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND  PARTNERSHIPS, INCLUDING OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND OUR MARKETING, SALES  AND DISTRIBUTION REACH THROUGH JOINT VENTURES AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL  ARRANGEMENTS;  \u25cf  THE COST AND TIMING  ASSOCIATED WITH ESTABLISHING REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR  PRODUCTS;  \u25cf  THE EFFECTS OF  COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS; AND  \u25cf  THE INDUSTRY DEMAND  AND PATIENT WELLNESS BEHAVIOR.  ANY  FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES IN A  TIMELY MANNER, OR ANY FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY MARKET AND  COMMERCIALIZE OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES, WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE  EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY. A  DISCUSSION OF THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH US AND  OUR BUSINESS ARE SET FORTH UNDER THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cRISK  FACTORS \u2013 RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\u201d IN OUR ANNUAL  REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, FILED  WITH THE SEC ON APRIL 1, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS ARE BASED ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNITED  STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE PREPARATION OF  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE  ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF  ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES.  ON AN ONGOING  BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE  RELATED TO THE RECORDING OF THE ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS,  ESTIMATED RESERVES FOR INVENTORY, ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF PROPERTY  AND EQUIPMENT, THE DETERMINATION OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR  DEFERRED TAXES, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE WARRANT LIABILITY,  AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. WE BASE  OUR ESTIMATES ON AUTHORITATIVE LITERATURE AND PRONOUNCEMENTS,  HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE  BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF  WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUE  OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER  SOURCES. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER  DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS  FOR ANY HISTORICAL PERIOD ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE  RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD.  WHILE  OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 2 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FILED WITH OUR  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018,  FILED WITH THE SEC ON APRIL 1, 2019, WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING  ACCOUNTING POLICIES RELATING TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, LIABILITIES  RELATED TO WARRANTS ISSUED, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ARE  SIGNIFICANT AND; THEREFORE, THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO AID YOU IN FULLY  UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL  RESULTS.  22  REVENUE RECOGNITION  SALES  OF MEDICAL DEVICES, INCLUDING RELATED APPLICATORS AND APPLICATOR  KITS, ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN SHIPPED TO THE CUSTOMER. SHIPMENTS UNDER  AGREEMENTS WITH DISTRIBUTORS ARE INVOICED AT A FIXED PRICE, ARE NOT  SUBJECT TO RETURN, AND PAYMENT FOR THESE SHIPMENTS IS NOT  CONTINGENT ON SALES BY THE DISTRIBUTOR. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES ON  SHIPMENTS TO DISTRIBUTORS IN THE SAME MANNER AS WITH OTHER  CUSTOMERS. THE INITIAL WARRANTY AND EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE SALE  OF MEDICAL DEVICES WILL BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER TIME AS THE  PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED. FEES FROM SERVICES PERFORMED  ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SERVICE IS PERFORMED. LICENSE FEE FOR  REFURBISHMENT OF APPLICATORS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME THE  CUSTOMER IS GRANTED THE LICENSE TO REFURBISH THE APPLICATORS.  REVENUE WILL BE CALCULATED USING THE TRANSACTION PRICE THAT  REPRESENTS THE MOST LIKELY CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED FOR THE  LICENSE TIMES THE NUMBER OF LICENSES ISSUED. FEES FOR UPFRONT  DISTRIBUTION LICENSE AGREEMENTS WILL BE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT  LINE BASIS BASED ON THE PAYMENT SCHEDULE IN THE  CONTRACT.  LIABILITIES RELATED TO WARRANTS ISSUED  WE  RECORD CERTAIN COMMON STOCK WARRANTS WE ISSUED AT FAIR VALUE AND  RECOGNIZE THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH WARRANTS AS A GAIN  OR LOSS, WHICH WE REPORT IN THE OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) SECTION IN  OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS. WE REPORT THESE  WARRANTS AT FAIR VALUE AND THEY ARE CLASSIFIED AS LIABILITIES  BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN CERTAIN DOWN-ROUND PROVISIONS ALLOWING FOR  REDUCTION OF THEIR EXERCISE PRICE. WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF  THESE WARRANTS USING A BINOMIAL OPTIONS PRICING MODEL.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  THE  STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN PROVIDES THAT STOCK OPTIONS, AND OTHER EQUITY  INTERESTS OR EQUITY-BASED INCENTIVES, MAY BE GRANTED TO KEY  PERSONNEL, DIRECTORS AND ADVISORS AT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMMON  STOCK AT THE TIME THE OPTION IS GRANTED, WHICH IS APPROVED BY OUR  BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE MAXIMUM TERM OF ANY OPTION GRANTED PURSUANT  TO THE STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN IS TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF  GRANT.  THE  FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION AWARD IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT  USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE EXPECTED TERMS OF  OPTIONS GRANTED REPRESENT THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT OPTIONS GRANTED  ARE ESTIMATED TO BE OUTSTANDING AND ARE DERIVED FROM THE  CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE OPTIONS GRANTED. WE AMORTIZE THE FAIR  VALUE OF EACH OPTION OVER EACH OPTION\u2019S VESTING  PERIOD.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND  2018  REVENUES AND COST OF REVENUES  REVENUES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WERE $177,963, COMPARED TO  $344,272 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, A DECREASE OF $166,309, OR  48%. REVENUE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM SALES IN EUROPE OF OUR  ORTHOPACE DEVICES AND RELATED APPLICATORS, SALES IN THE UNITED  STATES OF OUR DERMAPACE APPLICATORS AND UPFRONT DISTRIBUTION FEE  FROM OUR SOUTHEAST ASIA DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH JOHNFK MEDICAL  INC. (\"FKS\"). THE DECREASE IN REVENUE FOR 2019 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO  A DECREASE IN SALES OF ORTHOPACE DEVICES IN ASIA/PACIFIC AND THE  EUROPEAN COMMUNITY, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AS WELL AS LOWER  SALES OF NEW APPLICATORS.  COST OF  REVENUES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WERE $93,853,  COMPARED TO $165,466 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. GROSS PROFIT AS A  PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES WAS 47% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019, COMPARED TO 52% FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE DECREASE IN  GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES IN 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE  TO COST OF NEW AND REFURBISHED DERMAPACE APPLICATORS IN THE UNITED  STATES AS A RESULT OF PLACEMENTS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  INCREASED REVENUE FOR REFURBISHMENT LICENSE AND UPFRONT  DISTRIBUTION FEE WHICH HAVE LITTLE OR NO RELATED COST, AS COMPARED  TO 2018.  23  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  RESEARCH AND  DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WERE  $261,002, COMPARED TO $238,477 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, AN  INCREASE OF $22,525, OR 9%. THE INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND  DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES IN 2019, AS COMPARED TO 2018, WAS DUE TO AN  INCREASE IN CONTRACTING FOR TEMPORARY SERVICES AND INCREASED STUDY  EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR NEW DOSAGE STUDY IN  POLAND.  SELLING AND MARKETING EXPENSES  SELLING  AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  WERE $158,083, COMPARED TO $51,959 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018, AN INCREASE OF $106,124, OR 204%. THE INCREASE IN SALES AND  MARKETING EXPENSES IN 2019, AS COMPARED TO 2018, WAS DUE TO AN  INCREASE IN HIRING OF TRAINERS AND SALESPEOPLE AND INCREASED TRAVEL  EXPENSES FOR PLACEMENT AND TRAINING RELATED TO THE  COMMERCIALIZATION OF DERMAPACE.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  WERE $1,517,101, AS COMPARED TO $1,004,614 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018, AN INCREASE OF $512,487, OR 51%. THE INCREASE IN GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2019, AS COMPARED TO 2018, WAS DUE TO AN  INCREASE IN SALARY, BONUS AND BENEFITS RELATED TO NEW HIRES IN  2018, INCREASED LEGAL COSTS OF ASSOCIATED WITH SEC FILINGS AND  PATENT ISSUANCE AND MAINTENANCE, INCREASED CONSULTING EXPENSES OF  RELATED TO OUR INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENT STRATEGY FOR THE  COMMERCIALIZATION OF DERMAPACE AND ONE-TIME EXPENSE RELATED TO  EMAIL SPOOFING CYBER SECURITY BREACH.  DEPRECIATION  DEPRECIATION FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $8,357, COMPARED TO  $5,016 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, AN INCREASE OF $3,341, OR 67%.  THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE HIGHER DEPRECIATION RELATED TO INCREASE  IN FIXED ASSETS.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  OTHER  INCOME (EXPENSE) WAS A NET EXPENSE OF $336,885 FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO A NET EXPENSE OF  $4,735,395 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, A DECREASE OF  $4,398,510, OR 93%, IN THE NET EXPENSE. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO DECREASED INTEREST EXPENSE, BENEFICIAL CONVERSION DISCOUNT  AND DEBT DISCOUNT RELATED TO THE CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES  ISSUED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017 AND FIRST QUARTER OF 2018. IN  ADDITION, THE NET EXPENSE IN 2019 INCLUDED A NON-CASH GAIN FOR  VALUATION ADJUSTMENT  ON OUTSTANDING WARRANTS OF $32,359, AS COMPARED TO A NON-CASH LOSS  FOR VALUATION ADJUSTMENT ON OUTSTANDING WARRANTS OF $2,973,682 IN  2018.  NET LOSS  NET LOSS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $2,197,317, OR ($0.01) PER  BASIC AND DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $5,856,655, OR  ($0.04) PER BASIC AND DILUTED SHARE, FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, A  DECREASE IN THE NET LOSS OF $3,659,338, OR 62%. THE DECREASE IN THE  NET LOSS WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF A DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME  (EXPENSE), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OUR OPERATING  EXPENSES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE  EXPECT TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES FOR THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF  THE DERMAPACE SYSTEM AND WILL CONTINUE TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOP THE  NON-MEDICAL USES OF THE PACE TECHNOLOGY, BOTH OF WHICH WILL REQUIRE  ADDITIONAL CAPITAL RESOURCES. WE INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $2,197,317  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND $11,631,394 FOR THE  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THESE FACTORS ALONG WITH THE EVENTS  OF DEFAULT ON THE NOTES PAYABLE TO HEALTHTRONICS, INC., THE  COMPANY\u2019S CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES AND THE  COMPANY\u2019S SHORT TERM NOTES PAYABLE CREATE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT  ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN  FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE FINANCIAL ISSUANCE  DATE.  SINCE  INCEPTION IN 2005, OUR OPERATIONS HAVE PRIMARILY BEEN FUNDED FROM  THE SALE OF CAPITAL STOCK AND CONVERTIBLE DEBT  SECURITIES.  WE HAVE  ENTERED INTO SHORT TERM NOTES PAYABLE WITH TWENTY-FOUR INDIVIDUALS  BETWEEN JUNE 26, 2018 AND MARCH 13, 2019 IN THE TOTAL PRINCIPAL  AMOUNT OF $2,835,525 WITH AN INTEREST RATE OF 5% PER ANNUM. THE  PRINCIPAL AND ACCRUED INTEREST ARE DUE AND PAYABLE SIX MONTHS FROM  THE DATE OF ISSUANCE OR RECEIPT OF NOTICE OF WARRANT EXERCISE. ON  DECEMBER 26, 2018, THE COMPANY DEFAULTED ON THE SHORT TERM NOTES  PAYABLE ISSUED ON JUNE 26, 2018 AND BEGAN ACCRUING INTEREST AT THE  DEFAULT INTEREST RATE OF 10%. ON JANUARY 2, 2019, THE COMPANY  DEFAULTED ON THE SHORT TERM NOTES PAYABLE ISSUED ON JULY 2, 2018  AND BEGAN ACCRUING INTEREST AT THE DEFAULT INTEREST RATE OF 10%. ON  JANUARY 30, 2019, THE COMPANY DEFAULTED ON THE SHORT TERM NOTES  PAYABLE ISSUED ON JULY 30, 2018 AND BEGAN ACCRUING INTEREST AT THE  DEFAULT INTEREST RATE OF 10%.  24  THE CONTINUATION OF OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT UPON  RAISING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FINAL THREE QUARTERS OF 2019 TO  FUND OPERATIONS. MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THE CASH USED IN OPERATIONS FOR  THE COMPANY WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $225,000 TO $300,000 PER MONTH  FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2019 AND $275,000 TO $350,000 PER MONTH FOR  THE SECOND HALF OF 2019 AS  RESOURCES ARE DEVOTED TO THE  COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE DERMAPACE PRODUCT INCLUDING HIRING OF NEW  EMPLOYEES, EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND CONTINUED  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NON-MEDICAL USES OF OUR TECHNOLOGY.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLANS ARE TO OBTAIN  ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN 2019 THROUGH INVESTMENTS BY STRATEGIC  PARTNERS FOR MARKET OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE STRATEGIC  PARTNERSHIPS OR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS, OR RAISE CAPITAL THROUGH  THE CONVERSION OF OUTSTANDING WARRANTS, ISSUANCE OF COMMON OR  PREFERRED STOCK, SECURITIES CONVERTIBLE INTO COMMON STOCK, OR  SECURED OR UNSECURED DEBT. THESE POSSIBILITIES, TO THE EXTENT  AVAILABLE, MAY BE ON TERMS THAT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DILUTION TO  OUR EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES  THAT OUR PLANS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ON  THE TERMS OR TIMELINE WE EXPECT, OR AT ALL. A $400,000 FEE WE  ANTICIPATED RECEIVING IN APRIL 2019 FROM FKS UNDER THE TERMS OF A  JUNE 2018 AGREEMENT HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED TO DATE, AND WE ARE IN  NEGOTIATIONS WITH SUCH COUNTERPARTY WITH REPSECT TO PAYMENTS AND  OPERATIONS UNDER SUCH AGREEMENT.  ALTHOUGH NO ASSURANCES CAN  BE GIVEN, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES  OF EQUITY OR OTHER POTENTIAL FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AS DISCUSSED  ABOVE SHOULD PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FUNDING FOR US.  IF THESE EFFORTS ARE UNSUCCESSFUL, WE MAY BE  REQUIRED TO SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL OR DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS OR  OBTAIN FUNDS THROUGH FINANCING TRANSACTIONS WITH UNFAVORABLE  TERMS.  THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES  GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHICH  CONTEMPLATE CONTINUATION OF THE COMPANY AS A GOING CONCERN AND THE  REALIZATION OF ASSETS AND SATISFACTION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL  COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  PRESENTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT NECESSARILY PURPORT TO  REPRESENT REALIZABLE OR SETTLEMENT VALUES. THE CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENT THAT MIGHT  RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS UNCERTAINTY.  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT  INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO THE RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS  AND CLASSIFICATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT BE  NECESSARY SHOULD WE BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING  CONCERN.  IN  ADDITION, WE MAY HAVE POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN SALES, OFFERS  OR ISSUANCES OF EQUITY SECURITIES OF THE COMPANY IN POSSIBLE  VIOLATION OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION  STATEMENT ON FORM S-1 (REGISTRATION NO. 333-208676), DECLARED  EFFECTIVE ON FEBRUARY 16, 2016 (THE \u201c2016 REGISTRATION  STATEMENT\u201d), THE COMPANY SOUGHT TO REGISTER: A PRIMARY  OFFERING OF UP TO $4,000,000 UNITS, THE COMMON STOCK INCLUDED AS  PART OF THE UNITS, THE WARRANTS INCLUDED AS PART OF THE UNITS, AND  THE COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE OF SUCH WARRANTS; A PRIMARY  OFFERING OF UP TO $400,000 PLACEMENT AGENT WARRANTS AND THE COMMON  STOCK ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE OF SUCH PLACEMENT AGENT WARRANTS; AND  A SECONDARY OFFERING OF 23,545,144 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HELD BY  CERTAIN SELLING STOCKHOLDERS NAMED IN THE 2016 REGISTRATION  STATEMENT. THE SEC STAFF\u2019S INTERPRETATIONS PROVIDE THAT, WHEN  AN ISSUER IS REGISTERING UNITS COMPOSED OF COMMON STOCK, COMMON  STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS, AND THE COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE  WARRANTS, THE REGISTRATION FEE IS BASED ON THE OFFER PRICE OF THE  UNITS AND THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE WARRANTS. THE REGISTRATION FEE  PAID DID INCLUDE THE FEE BASED ON THE OFFER PRICE OF THE UNITS,  ALLOCATED TO THE UNIT LINE ITEM IN THE FEE TABLE. ALTHOUGH THE FEE  TABLE IN THE 2016 REGISTRATION STATEMENT INCLUDED A LINE ITEM FOR  THE COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE WARRANTS, THE COMPANY DID NOT  INCLUDE IN THAT LINE ITEM THE FEE PAYABLE BASED ON THE EXERCISE  PRICE OF $0.08 PER SHARE FOR SUCH WARRANTS, WHICH AMOUNT SHOULD  HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO SUCH LINE ITEM BASED ON THE SEC  STAFF\u2019S INTERPRETATIONS. AS A RESULT, A PORTION OF THE  SECURITIES INTENDED TO BE REGISTERED BY THE 2016 REGISTRATION  STATEMENT WAS NOT REGISTERED. IN ADDITION, IN A POST-EFFECTIVE  AMENDMENT TO THE 2016 REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED ON SEPTEMBER 23,  2016, TOO MANY PLACEMENT AGENT WARRANTS WERE INADVERTENTLY  DEREGISTERED. THE POST-EFFECTIVE AMENDMENT STATED THAT THE COMPANY  HAD ISSUED $180,100, BASED ON 2,251,250 CLASS L WARRANTS ISSUED  WITH A $0.08 EXERCISE PRICE OF WARRANTS TO THE PLACEMENT AGENT AND  THEREFORE DEREGISTERED $219,900, BASED ON 2,748,750 CLASS L  WARRANTS ISSUED WITH A $0.08 EXERCISE PRICE OF PLACEMENT AGENT  WARRANTS FROM THE $400,000, BASED ON 5,000,000 CLASS L WARRANTS  ISSUED WITH A $0.08 EXERCISE PRICE TOTAL OFFERING AMOUNT INCLUDED  IN THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT. THE ACTUAL WARRANTS ISSUED TO THE  PLACEMENT AGENT TOTALED $240,133.36, BASED ON 3,001,667 CLASS L  WARRANTS ISSUED WITH A $0.08 EXERCISE PRICE, AND ONLY $159,867,  BASED ON 1,998,338 CLASS L WARRANTS ISSUED WITH A $0.08 EXERCISE  PRICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEREGISTERED IN SUCH POST-EFFECTIVE  AMENDMENT. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE NOT REGISTERED OR FAILED TO  MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF  THE TRANSACTIONS IN SECURITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE AND WITH RESPECT TO  OUR ONGOING OFFERING OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE  WARRANTS, AND A VIOLATION OF SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT DID IN  FACT OCCUR OR IS OCCURRING, ELIGIBLE HOLDERS OF OUR SECURITIES THAT  PARTICIPATED IN THESE OFFERINGS WOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO RESCIND THEIR  TRANSACTIONS, AND THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO REFUND ANY AMOUNTS PAID  FOR THE SECURITIES, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON  THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION. ELIGIBLE SECURITYHOLDERS  HAVE NOT FILED A CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF  SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT WITH RESPECT TO THESE TRANSACTIONS,  BUT THEY COULD FILE A CLAIM IN THE FUTURE. FURTHERMORE, THE ONGOING  OFFERING OF AND ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING  CERTAIN OF OUR WARRANTS FROM THE 2016 REGISTRATION STATEMENT MAY  HAVE BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 5 OF THE  SECURITIES ACT AND THE RULES AND REGULATIONS UNDER THE SECURITIES  ACT, BECAUSE WE DID NOT UPDATE THE PROSPECTUS IN THE 2016  REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER THE 2016  REGISTRATION STATEMENT WAS DECLARED EFFECTIVE AND BECAUSE OUR  RELIANCE ON RULE 457(P) UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT IN AN AMENDMENT TO  OUR REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-1 (REGISTRATION NO.  333-213774) FILED ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2016 EFFECTED A DEREGISTRATION  OF THE SECURITIES REGISTERED UNDER THE 2016 REGISTRATION STATEMENT.  ELIGIBLE SECURITYHOLDERS HAVE NOT FILED A CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY  ALLEGING A VIOLATION OF SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES ACT, BUT THEY  COULD FILE SUCH A CLAIM IN THE FUTURE. IF A VIOLATION OF SECTION 5  OF THE SECURITIES ACT DID IN FACT OCCUR OR IS OCCURRING, ELIGIBLE  SECURITYHOLDERS WOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO RESCIND THEIR TRANSACTIONS,  AND THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO REFUND ANY AMOUNTS PAID THE SECURITIES,  WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S  FINANCIAL CONDITION.  25  WE MAY  ALSO ATTEMPT TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IF THERE ARE FAVORABLE  MARKET CONDITIONS OR OTHER STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS EVEN IF WE HAVE  SUFFICIENT FUNDS FOR PLANNED OPERATIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE  RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR  SHAREHOLDERS WILL EXPERIENCE DILUTION AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO USE  SOME OR ALL OF THE NET PROCEEDS TO REPAY OUR INDEBTEDNESS, AND DEBT  FINANCINGS, IF AVAILABLE, MAY INVOLVE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS OR MAY  OTHERWISE CONSTRAIN OUR FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY. TO THE EXTENT THAT  WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS, IT  MAY BE NECESSARY TO RELINQUISH SOME RIGHTS TO OUR INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY OR GRANT LICENSES ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT FAVORABLE TO US.  IN ADDITION, PAYMENTS MADE BY POTENTIAL COLLABORATORS OR LICENSORS  GENERALLY WILL DEPEND UPON OUR ACHIEVEMENT OF NEGOTIATED  DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY MILESTONES. FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THESE  MILESTONES WOULD HARM OUR FUTURE CAPITAL POSITION.  CASH  AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DECREASED BY $265,603 FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND DECREASED BY $575,979 FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND  2018, NET CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $1,285,551 AND  $1,848,565, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF COMPENSATION  COSTS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND GENERAL CORPORATE  OPERATIONS. THE DECREASE OF $563,014 IN THE USE OF CASH FOR  OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, AS  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD FOR 2018, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE  INCREASED ACCRUED OPERATING AND PAYROLL RELATED EXPENSES AND  INCREASED RECEIVABLES IN 2019. NET CASH USED BY INVESTING  ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018,  CONSISTED OF PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT OF $22,054 AND  $7,720, RESPECTIVELY. NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $1,044,400, WHICH  CONSISTED OF $319,867 FROM THE EXERCISE OF WARRANTS, $698,333 FROM  THE ISSUANCE OF SHORT TERM NOTES PAYABLE AND $26,200 FROM AN  ADVANCE FROM RELATED PARTIES. NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING  ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WAS  $1,279,371, WHICH CONSISTED OF $12,000 FROM ADVANCES FROM RELATED  PARTIES, $13,528 FROM EXERCISE OF WARRANTS, $1,159,785 FROM THE  ISSUANCE OF CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES AND $94,058 FROM ISSUANCE  OF NOTE PAYABLE, PRODUCT.  SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION  WE HAVE  DETERMINED THAT WE HAVE ONE OPERATING SEGMENT. OUR REVENUES ARE  GENERATED FROM SALES IN UNITED STATES, EUROPE, CANADA, ASIA AND  ASIA/PACIFIC. ALL SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES ARE GENERATED IN THE UNITED  STATES AND ALL SIGNIFICANT ASSETS ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED  STATES.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, THE INFORMATION CONTAINED UNDER THE CAPTION \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,\u201d WHICH APPEARS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS REPORT, AND THE INFORMATION IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018.  OVERVIEW  SPARTANNASH, HEADQUARTERED IN GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN, IS A LEADING MULTI-REGIONAL GROCERY DISTRIBUTOR AND GROCERY RETAILER WHOSE CORE BUSINESSES INCLUDE DISTRIBUTING GROCERY PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSE GROUP OF INDEPENDENT AND CHAIN RETAILERS, ITS CORPORATE OWNED RETAIL STORES, MILITARY COMMISSARIES AND EXCHANGES IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS PREMIER FRESH PRODUCE DISTRIBUTION AND FRESH FOOD PROCESSING. THE COMPANY OPERATES THREE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: FOOD DISTRIBUTION, MILITARY AND RETAIL. THE COMPANY SERVES CUSTOMERS IN ALL 50 STATES.  THE COMPANY\u2019S FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT PROVIDES A WIDE VARIETY OF NATIONALLY BRANDED AND PRIVATE BRAND GROCERY PRODUCTS AND PERISHABLE FOOD PRODUCTS TO APPROXIMATELY 2,100 INDEPENDENT RETAIL LOCATIONS, THE COMPANY\u2019S CORPORATE OWNED RETAIL STORES, FOOD SERVICE DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS. THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT PRIMARILY CONDUCTS BUSINESS IN THE MIDWEST AND SOUTHEAST REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY PROCESSES FRESH-CUT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND OTHER VALUE-ADDED MEAL SOLUTIONS AND SUPPLIES THESE PRODUCTS TO GROCERY RETAILERS AND FOOD SERVICE DISTRIBUTORS. THROUGH THE FRESH KITCHEN FACILITY, THE COMPANY PROCESSES, COOKS AND PACKAGES FRESH PROTEIN-BASED FOODS AND COMPLETE MEAL SOLUTIONS FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS.  17  THE COMPANY\u2019S MI  LITARY SEGMENT CONTRACTS WITH MANUFACTURERS TO DISTRIBUTE A WIDE VARIETY OF GROCERY PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO MILITARY COMMISSARIES AND EXCHANGES LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, EUROPE, CUBA, PUERTO RICO,  HONDURAS,  BAHRAIN, DJIBOUTI AND  EGYPT. THE COMPANY HAS OVER 40 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE ACTING AS A DISTRIBUTOR TO U.S. MILITARY COMMISSARIES AND EXCHANGES. THE COMPANY IS THE EXCLUSIVE WORLDWIDE SUPPLIER OF PRIVATE BRAND PRODUCTS TO U.S. MILITARY COMMISSARIES AND IS CONTINUING TO PARTNER WI  TH DECA IN THE ROLLOUT OF PRIVATE BRAND PRODUCTS TO MILITARY COMMISSARIES WHICH BEGAN DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017.  AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER, THE COMPANY\u2019S RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATED 159 CORPORATE OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE MIDWEST REGION PRIMARILY UNDER THE BANNERS OF  FAMILY FARE, MARTIN\u2019S SUPER MARKETS, VG\u2019S FOOD AND PHARMACY, D&W FRESH MARKETS, SUN MART  AND  FAMILY FRESH MARKET.  THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS PHARMACY SERVICES IN 99 OF ITS CORPORATE OWNED RETAIL STORES AND OPERATES 37 FUEL CENTERS. THE RETAIL STORES HAVE A \u201cNEIGHBORHOOD MARKET\u201d FOCUS TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM SUPERCENTERS AND LIMITED ASSORTMENT STORES.  ALL FISCAL QUARTERS ARE 12 WEEKS, EXCEPT FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S FIRST QUARTER, WHICH IS 16 WEEKS AND WILL GENERALLY INCLUDE THE EASTER HOLIDAY. THE FOURTH QUARTER INCLUDES THE THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS, AND DEPENDING ON THE FISCAL YEAR END, MAY INCLUDE THE NEW YEAR\u2019S HOLIDAY.  IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE MAY VARY WITH SEASONALITY. MANY STORES ARE DEPENDENT ON TOURISM AND THEREFORE, ARE MOST AFFECTED BY SEASONS AND WEATHER PATTERNS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF SNOWFALL DURING THE WINTER MONTHS AND THE RANGE OF TEMPERATURE DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS.  2019 FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED APRIL 20, 2019, THE COMPANY MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND BETTER POSITIONED ITSELF FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY. IN LINE WITH ITS STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE TO ACHIEVE MID-SINGLE DIGIT SALES GROWTH, THE COMPANY REALIZED AN INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED NET SALES OF 6.6% COMPARED WITH THE QUARTER ENDED APRIL 21, 2018. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER WAS DRIVEN BY THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S SUPER MARKETS, INC. (\u201cMARTIN\u2019S\u201d), AS WELL AS SALES GROWTH IN THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION AND MILITARY DISTRIBUTION SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON ITS OTHER TOP OBJECTIVES FOR THE CURRENT YEAR, INCLUDING STRENGTHENING ITS MANAGEMENT TEAM, SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS, GENERATING  IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH ITS PROJECT ONE TEAM INITIATIVE, AND REDUCING ITS DEBT, WORKING CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL LEVERAGE RATIOS, WHICH WILL ALL CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVED GROWTH IN ADJUSTED OPERATING EARNINGS AND ADJUSTED EBITDA.  FIRST QUARTER 2019 OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE.  \u2022  THE FOOD DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT REALIZED SALES GROWTH OF 1.2% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. BEFORE THE IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY SALES TO MARTIN\u2019S, SALES INCREASED 5.2%, DRIVEN LARGELY BY SALES TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON PARTNERING WITH INDEPENDENT RETAILERS TO SUPPORT THEIR OPERATIONS AND ENHANCE THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE.  \u2022  LATE IN THE FIRST QUARTER, THE COMPANY INITIATED A VOLUNTARY PRODUCT RECALL FOR FRESH-CUT MELON PRODUCTS PRODUCED AT THE CAITO FACILITY IN INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA DUE TO POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE RECALL, THE COMPANY TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED PRODUCTION OF THE RECALLED PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY REMAINS FOCUSED ON PRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION AND SPECIFICALLY WITHIN ITS FRESH CUT FRUIT AND VEGETABLE OPERATIONS. TESTING WAS PERFORMED WITHIN THE MANUFACTURING ENVIRONMENT BY THIRD PARTY FOOD SAFETY EXPERTS AS WELL AS THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) AND NO EVIDENCE OF CONTAMINATION WAS DETECTED, A PROCESS WHICH INCLUDED OVER 1,000 TESTS AMONG THE VARIOUS PARTIES. THE COMPANY IS WORKING TO IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL TESTING OF INCOMING PRODUCT TO FURTHER ENHANCE ITS FOOD SAFETY PROTOCOLS.  \u2022  THE MILITARY SEGMENT CONTINUED TO SUPPORT DECA IN THE EXPANSION OF ITS PRIVATE BRAND PROGRAM, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO SALES GROWTH IN THE QUARTER. THE COMPANY ALSO GAINED INCREMENTAL SALES WITH AN EXISTING CUSTOMER WHICH OFFSET THE CHALLENGES OF OPERATING IN A COMMISSARY ENVIRONMENT WHICH CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE  NEGATIVE SALES TRENDS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE DISTRIBUTION CENTER THAT EXPERIENCED OPERATIONAL ISSUES IN LATE 2018 AND INTO THE BEGINNING OF 2019. THE COMPANY HAS MADE KEY LEADERSHIP CHANGES AND IMPLEMENTED ENHANCEMENTS TO ITS PROCESSES AND CONTROLS. BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER, THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER\u2019S PERFORMANCE WAS STABILIZED, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE METRICS AND PROFITABILITY RETURNED TO ACCEPTABLE LEVELS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN ITS EXECUTION OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S NEW RETAIL BRAND POSITIONING. SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER, THE COMPANY UNVEILED THE REMODEL OF 18 STORES IN MICHIGAN. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BEGIN REALIZING THE BENEFIT OF THESE INVESTMENTS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2019. THESE INVESTMENTS SUPPORT THE COMPANY\u2019S OBJECTIVES RELATED TO BRAND REPOSITIONING AND IT EXPECTS THAT THEY WILL HELP IMPROVE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN FISCAL 2019 COMPARABLE STORE SALES.  18  \u2022  THE COMPANY  CLOSED ON THE ACQUISITION OF  MARTIN\u2019S IN EARLY 2019. MARTIN\u2019S IS A LEADING MIDWEST INDEPENDENT SUPERMARKET CHAIN WHICH OPERATES 21 STORES IN NORTHERN INDIANA AND  SOUTHWESTERN MICHIGAN. THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S HAS CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN SALES AND OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT  AND WILL CONTINUE TO COMPLEMENT THE COMPANY\u2019S EXISTING RETAIL INITIATIVES.  \u2022  THE COMPANY CONTINUED ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH A THIRD-PARTY ADVISORY FIRM ON A COMPANY-WIDE INITIATIVE, PROJECT ONE TEAM, DESIGNED TO TRANSFORM ITS CULTURE AND EMPOWER ASSOCIATES AT ALL LEVELS TO DRIVE SUBSTANTIAL ONGOING, SUSTAINABLE IMPROVEMENTS TO BUSINESS PROCESSES AND RESULTS. THE COMPANY SET AN INITIAL GOAL TO REALIZE AN ANNUAL RUN RATE OF AT LEAST $15 MILLION IN SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT 24 MONTHS FROM THIS INITIATIVE. THE COMPANY IS ON ITS WAY TO EXCEEDING THIS OBJECTIVE BY IDENTIFYING OVER $20 MILLION IN ANNUAL RUN RATE SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH THE COMPANY WILL IMPLEMENT OVER THE  NEXT 24 MONTHS.  THE EFFECT OF IMPLEMENTING THESE OPPORTUNITIES IS NOT CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO EARNINGS IN 2019.  \u2022  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER, THE COMPANY APPOINTED A NEW CHIEF MERCHANDISING AND MARKETING OFFICER, CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER AND SEVERAL OTHER KEY ADDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE IT AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS. OTHER STRATEGIC ADDITIONS TO THE MANAGEMENT TEAM AT VARIOUS LEVELS ARE IN PROCESS AS PART OF A PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED PLAN TO STRENGTHEN THE MANAGEMENT TEAM, SYSTEMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS.  \u2022  ADJUSTED FOR THE FUNDING OF THE MARTIN\u2019S ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY PAID DOWN OVER $20 MILLION IN DEBT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE COMPANY ALSO REDUCED ITS INVENTORY LEVELS BY OVER 2% FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WITHOUT NEGATIVELY IMPACTING CUSTOMER SERVICE LEVELS, DESPITE CONTINUED SALES GROWTH. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON DEBT AND WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019, THE COMPANY EXPECTS FOOD DISTRIBUTION TO ACHIEVE LOW- TO MID-SINGLE DIGIT SALES GROWTH DRIVEN BY EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND NEW BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SOME ATTRITION IN THE INDEPENDENT RETAIL BASE. THIS EXPECTATION EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY SALES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE MARTIN\u2019S BUSINESS, ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $150 TO $170 MILLION. IN THE MILITARY SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT NEW BUSINESS WITHIN THE SEGMENT, INCLUDING CONTINUED PRIVATE BRAND GROWTH, WILL LARGELY OFFSET THE NEGATIVE DECA COMPARABLE SALES TREND. WITHIN THE RETAIL SEGMENT, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TOTAL SALES WILL INCREASE DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S AND THE SIGNIFICANT CURRENT YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BRAND POSITIONING, PARTLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF STORE RATIONALIZATION PLANS. MARTIN\u2019S IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $475 MILLION TO $500 MILLION IN RETAIL SEGMENT NET SALES. FROM A PROFITABILITY PERSPECTIVE, THE EXPECTED NET SALES INCREASES WILL BE OFFSET BY CHALLENGES PRIMARILY WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN ENVIRONMENT, WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO NAVIGATE HISTORICALLY TIGHT LABOR MARKETS AND A HIGHER COST OF TRANSPORTATION. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS LESS CONTRIBUTION FROM THE FRESH KITCHEN OPERATIONS THAN INITIALLY ANTICIPATED AND HAS ENGAGED OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS TO WORK WITH THE SPARTANNASH TEAM TO GENERATE PROFITABILITY IN THIS BUSINESS.

NET CASH USED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS CONTAINS THE NET CASH FLOWS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S RETAIL AND FOOD DISTRIBUTION DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF FACILITY MAINTENANCE EXPENDITURES.  DEBT MANAGEMENT  TOTAL DEBT, INCLUDING FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES, WAS $771.1 MILLION AND $698.1 MILLION AS OF APRIL 20, 2019 AND DECEMBER 29, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL DEBT WAS DRIVEN BY THE CURRENT YEAR ACQUISITION OF MARTIN\u2019S, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PAYMENTS.  LIQUIDITY  THE COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND ITS SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY WHICH HAS MAXIMUM AVAILABLE CREDIT OF $1.1 BILLION. AS OF APRIL 20, 2019, THE SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY HAD OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OF $727.7 MILLION. ADDITIONAL AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S $1.1 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY ARE BASED ON STIPULATED ADVANCE RATES ON ELIGIBLE ASSETS, AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT REQUIRES THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAIN EXCESS AVAILABILITY OF 10% OF THE BORROWING BASE, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY HAD EXCESS AVAILABILITY AFTER THE 10% COVENANT OF $204.7 MILLION AT APRIL 20, 2019. PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASES OF OUTSTANDING SHARES ARE PERMITTED, PROVIDED THAT CERTAIN LEVELS OF EXCESS AVAILABILITY ARE MAINTAINED.

THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY MATURES DECEMBER 18, 2023 AND IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, AND DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE CASH FLOW AT OR ABOVE CURRENT LEVELS OR THAT THE COMPANY WILL MAINTAIN ITS ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT RATIO (CURRENT ASSETS TO CURRENT LIABILITIES) WAS 1.90-TO-1 AT APRIL 20, 2019 COMPARED TO 2.10-TO-1 AT DECEMBER 29, 2018, AND ITS INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS $497.7 MILLION AT APRIL 20, 2019 COMPARED TO $524.6 MILLION AT DECEMBER 29, 2018. NET DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO WAS 0.52-TO-1 AT APRIL 20, 2019 COMPARED TO 0.49-TO-1 AT DECEMBER 29, 2018. THE CURRENT YEAR RATIOS INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE STANDARD (ASU 2016-02) AND THEREFORE LACK COMPARABILITY TO THE PRIOR YEAR RATIOS.  27  TOTAL NET DEBT IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT IS DEFINED AS LONG-TERM DEBT AND  FINANCE  LEASE  LIABILITIES  , PLUS CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND  FINANCE  LEASE  LIABILITIES  , LESS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE RATIO OF NET DEBT TO CAPITAL IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET DEBT, AS DEFINED PREVIOUSLY, BY TOTAL CAPITAL (NET DEBT PLUS TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY). THE COMPANY BELIEVES BOTH MANAGE  MENT AND ITS INVESTORS FIND THE INFORMATION USEFUL BECAUSE IT REFLECTS THE AMOUNT OF LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY AVAILABLE CASH AND TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS. TOTAL NET DEBT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND MAY DIFFER  FROM SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES.  FOLLOWING IS A RECONCILIATION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES TO TOTAL NET LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES AS OF APRIL 20, 2019 AND DECEMBER 29, 2018.  APRIL 20,  DECEMBER 29,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES  $18,006  $18,263  LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES  753,118  679,797  TOTAL DEBT  771,124  698,060  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  (21,360  )  (18,585  )  TOTAL NET LONG-TERM DEBT  $749,764  $679,475  FOR INFORMATION ON CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, SEE THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018.

CASH DIVIDENDS  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED APRIL 20, 2019, THE COMPANY RETURNED $6.9 MILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS FROM DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. A 5.6% INCREASE IN THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND RATE FROM $0.18 PER SHARE TO $0.19 PER SHARE WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ANNOUNCED ON FEBRUARY 28, 2019. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO PAY A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND, ADOPTION OF A DIVIDEND POLICY DOES NOT COMMIT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO DECLARE FUTURE DIVIDENDS. EACH FUTURE DIVIDEND WILL BE CONSIDERED AND DECLARED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT ITS DISCRETION. WHETHER THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONTINUES TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION, ANTICIPATED PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF ITS CREDIT FACILITIES.  UNDER THE SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE COMPANY IS GENERALLY PERMITTED TO PAY DIVIDENDS IN ANY FISCAL YEAR UP TO AN AMOUNT SUCH THAT ALL CASH DIVIDENDS, TOGETHER WITH ANY CASH DISTRIBUTIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, DO NOT EXCEED $35.0 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS GENERALLY PERMITTED TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE SHARES IN EXCESS OF $35.0 MILLION IN ANY FISCAL YEAR SO LONG AS ITS EXCESS AVAILABILITY, AS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, IS IN EXCESS OF 10% OF THE TOTAL BORROWING BASE, AS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, BEFORE AND AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY HAS ALSO MADE CERTAIN COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS THAT EXTEND BEYOND APRIL 20, 2019.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT MAY NOT BE READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S ONGOING REVIEW, THE COMPANY MAKES ADJUSTMENTS IT CONSIDERS APPROPRIATE UNDER THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.

WE DEFINE FREE CASH FLOW AS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, LESS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  PLUS THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF OPERATING ASSETS.  FREE CASH FLOW IS A RELEVANT INDICATOR OF OUR ABILITY TO REPAY MATURING DEBT, REVISE OUR DIVIDEND POLICY OR FUND OTHER USES OF CAPITAL THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ENHANCE STOCKHOLDER VALUE.  FREE CASH FLOW IS CONSIDERED A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE UNDER THE RULES OF THE SEC.  FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED AND DOES NOT REPRESENT REMAINING CASH FLOW AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MEASURE DOES NOT DEDUCT PAYMENTS REQUIRED FOR DEBT MATURITIES, PAYMENTS MADE FOR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS OR REQUIRED PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS, IF ANY.

WITH A SIZABLE PORTION OF OUR PRIVATE AND NATIONAL BRANDED APPAREL SOURCED FROM CHINA, WE ARE EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL INCREASES IN PRODUCT COSTS WHICH MAY RESULT FROM INCREASED TARIFFS IMPOSED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN CONNECTION WITH ITS TRADE DISPUTES WITH CHINA. WE EXPECT A MINIMAL IMPACT ON OUR PRODUCT COSTS BASED ON THE CURRENT TARIFFS THAT ARE IN EFFECT AND HAVE TAKEN ACTIONS TO DIVERSIFY OUR SOURCING OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, WE CAN EXPECT A MORE MEANINGFUL INCREASE TO OUR PRODUCT COSTS IF POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL TARIFFS GO INTO EFFECT ON ALL CHINESE IMPORTS AND SPECIFICALLY APPAREL AND FOOTWEAR.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.

WE OFFER INNOVATIVE AND ADAPTABLE TECHNOLOGY FOCUSED ON THE CONSUMER INTERNET EXPERIENCE AND CLOUD DELIVERY MODEL. OUR APPLICATIONS ARE DESIGNED FOR GLOBAL ENTERPRISES TO MANAGE COMPLEX AND DYNAMIC OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS. WE PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH HIGHLY ADAPTABLE, ACCESSIBLE, AND RELIABLE APPLICATIONS TO MANAGE CRITICAL BUSINESS FUNCTIONS THAT ENABLE THEM TO OPTIMIZE THEIR FINANCIAL AND HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES.  WE WERE FOUNDED IN 2005 TO DELIVER CLOUD APPLICATIONS TO GLOBAL ENTERPRISES. OUR APPLICATIONS ARE DESIGNED AROUND THE WAY PEOPLE WORK TODAY\u2014IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS GLOBAL, COLLABORATIVE, FAST-PACED, AND MOBILE. OUR CYCLE OF FREQUENT UPDATES HAS FACILITATED RAPID INNOVATION AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW APPLICATIONS THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY. WE BEGAN OFFERING OUR HCM APPLICATION IN 2006 AND OUR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT APPLICATION IN 2007. SINCE THEN WE HAVE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN INNOVATION AND HAVE CONSISTENTLY INTRODUCED NEW SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS.  WE OFFER WORKDAY APPLICATIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS ON AN ENTERPRISE-WIDE SUBSCRIPTION BASIS, TYPICALLY WITH CONTRACT TERMS OF THREE YEARS OR LONGER AND WITH SUBSCRIPTION FEES LARGELY BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE CUSTOMER\u2019S WORKFORCE. WE GENERALLY RECOGNIZE REVENUES FROM SUBSCRIPTION FEES RATABLY OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT. WE CURRENTLY DERIVE A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF OUR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES REVENUES FROM SUBSCRIPTIONS TO OUR HCM APPLICATION. WE MARKET OUR APPLICATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE.  OUR DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE INCLUDES MEDIUM-SIZED AND LARGE, GLOBAL COMPANIES, AS WELL AS SMALLER ORGANIZATIONS THAT PRIMARILY USE OUR PLANNING PRODUCT. WE HAVE ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WITH A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF OUR GROWTH COMING FROM NEW CUSTOMERS. OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL FOCUS IS ON GROWING OUR REVENUES AND EXPANDING OUR CUSTOMER BASE. WHILE WE ARE INCURRING LOSSES TODAY, WE STRIVE TO INVEST IN A DISCIPLINED MANNER ACROSS ALL OF OUR FUNCTIONAL AREAS TO SUSTAIN CONTINUED NEAR-TERM REVENUE GROWTH AND SUPPORT OUR LONG-TERM INITIATIVES. OUR OPERATING EXPENSES HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS IN RECENT PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OF OUR EMPLOYEE POPULATION. WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  11,000  AND APPROXIMATELY  8,600  EMPLOYEES AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  WE INTEND TO CONTINUE INVESTING FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH. WE HAVE INVESTED, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INVEST, HEAVILY IN OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS TO DELIVER ADDITIONAL COMPELLING APPLICATIONS AND TO ADDRESS CUSTOMERS\u2019 EVOLVING NEEDS. IN ADDITION, WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR APPLICATIONS GLOBALLY, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE AND ASIA, BY INVESTING IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT TO ADDRESS THE BUSINESS NEEDS OF LOCAL MARKETS, INCREASING OUR SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATIONS, ACQUIRING, BUILDING AND/OR LEASING ADDITIONAL OFFICE SPACE, AND EXPANDING OUR ECOSYSTEM OF SERVICE PARTNERS TO SUPPORT LOCAL DEPLOYMENTS. WE EXPECT TO MAKE FURTHER SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR DATA CENTER CAPACITY AS WE PLAN FOR FUTURE GROWTH. WE ARE ALSO INVESTING IN PERSONNEL TO SERVICE OUR GROWING CUSTOMER BASE.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ALSO REGULARLY EVALUATE ACQUISITIONS OR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES, JOINT VENTURES, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN AN EFFORT TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SUCH ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE, AND WE PLAN TO REINVEST A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR INCREMENTAL REVENUE IN FUTURE PERIODS TO GROW OUR BUSINESS AND CONTINUE OUR LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE INDUSTRY. WHILE WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OPERATING MARGINS, THESE ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS WILL INCREASE OUR COSTS ON AN ABSOLUTE BASIS IN THE NEAR-TERM. MANY OF THESE INVESTMENTS WILL OCCUR IN ADVANCE OF EXPERIENCING ANY DIRECT BENEFIT FROM THEM AND COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE IF WE ARE ALLOCATING OUR RESOURCES EFFICIENTLY. WE EXPECT OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES TO DECREASE OVER TIME AS WE GROW OUR REVENUES, AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL GAIN ECONOMIES OF SCALE BY INCREASING OUR CUSTOMER BASE WITHOUT DIRECT INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND BY UTILIZING MORE OF THE CAPACITY OF OUR DATA CENTERS.  SINCE INCEPTION, WE HAVE ALSO INVESTED HEAVILY IN OUR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION TO HELP ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOY AND ADOPT OUR APPLICATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR PROFESSIONAL SERVICE PARTNER ECOSYSTEM TO FURTHER SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS. WE BELIEVE OUR INVESTMENT IN PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, AS WELL AS PARTNERS BUILDING CONSULTING PRACTICES AROUND WORKDAY, WILL DRIVE ADDITIONAL CUSTOMER SUBSCRIPTIONS AND CONTINUED GROWTH IN REVENUES. DUE TO OUR ABILITY TO LEVERAGE THE EXPANDING PARTNER ECOSYSTEM, WE EXPECT THAT THE RATE OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE GROWTH WILL DECLINE OVER TIME AND CONTINUE TO BE LOWER THAN SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES REVENUE GROWTH.

SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES REVENUES ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, THE NUMBER OF WORKERS AT EACH CUSTOMER, THE SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS SUBSCRIBED TO BY EACH CUSTOMER, AND THE PRICE OF OUR APPLICATIONS.  THE MIX OF THE APPLICATIONS TO WHICH A CUSTOMER SUBSCRIBES CAN AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DUE TO PRICE DIFFERENTIALS IN OUR APPLICATIONS. PRICING FOR OUR APPLICATIONS VARIES BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPLEXITY AND MATURITY OF THE APPLICATION AND ITS ACCEPTANCE IN THE MARKETPLACE. NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERINGS BY COMPETITORS IN THE FUTURE COULD ALSO IMPACT THE MIX AND PRICING OF OUR OFFERINGS.  SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME AS THEY ARE DELIVERED AND CONSUMED CONCURRENTLY OVER THE CONTRACTUAL TERM, BEGINNING ON THE DATE OUR SERVICE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE CUSTOMER. OUR SUBSCRIPTION CONTRACTS TYPICALLY HAVE A TERM OF THREE YEARS OR LONGER AND ARE GENERALLY NON-CANCELABLE. WE GENERALLY INVOICE OUR CUSTOMERS ANNUALLY IN ADVANCE. AMOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN INVOICED ARE INITIALLY RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE.  OUR CONSULTING ENGAGEMENTS ARE BILLED ON A TIME AND MATERIALS OR FIXED FEE BASIS, AND REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY RECOGNIZED OVER TIME AS THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED. IN SOME CASES, WE SUPPLEMENT OUR CONSULTING TEAMS BY SUBCONTRACTING RESOURCES FROM OUR SERVICE PARTNERS AND DEPLOYING THEM ON CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENTS. AS OUR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION AND THE WORKDAY-RELATED CONSULTING PRACTICES OF OUR PARTNER FIRMS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP, WE EXPECT THE PARTNERS TO INCREASINGLY CONTRACT DIRECTLY WITH OUR SUBSCRIPTION CUSTOMERS.

WE USE THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES TO UNDERSTAND AND COMPARE OPERATING RESULTS ACROSS ACCOUNTING PERIODS, FOR INTERNAL BUDGETING AND FORECASTING PURPOSES, FOR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM OPERATING PLANS, AND TO EVALUATE OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS AND OTHERS IN UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND PROSPECTS IN THE SAME MANNER AS MANAGEMENT AND IN COMPARING FINANCIAL RESULTS ACROSS ACCOUNTING PERIODS AND TO THOSE OF PEER COMPANIES.

THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A  $7 MILLION  REDUCTION IN INTEREST EXPENSE AND A $7 MILLION GAIN RESULTING FROM SALES OF MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  , OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WERE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES TOTALING  $1.9 BILLION  , WHICH WERE PRIMARILY HELD FOR WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES. OUR CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE COMPOSED PRIMARILY OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. AGENCY OBLIGATIONS, CORPORATE BONDS, COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  WE HAVE FINANCED OUR OPERATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH CUSTOMER PAYMENTS, SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, AND ISSUANCE OF DEBT. OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR CUSTOMER GROWTH RATE, SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL ACTIVITY, THE TIMING OF CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITIES IN PLEASANTON, CALIFORNIA, AND THE ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL FACILITIES, THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS, THE EXPANSION OF SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW AND ENHANCED SERVICES OFFERINGS, THE CONTINUING MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR SERVICES, AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES. WE MAY ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS TO ACQUIRE OR INVEST IN COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES, SERVICES, TECHNOLOGIES, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE FUTURE. WE ALSO MAY CHOOSE TO SEEK ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING.  OUR CASH FLOWS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018  WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).

THE  IMPROVEMENT  IN CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN SALES AND THE RELATED CASH COLLECTIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES DRIVEN BY INCREASED HEADCOUNT.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  WAS  $67 MILLION  , WHICH WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR DATA CENTER AND OFFICE SPACE PROJECTS OF  $66 MILLION  , CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF OUR DEVELOPMENT CENTER OF  $34 MILLION  , AND THE TIMING OF PURCHASES AND MATURITIES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES. THESE PAYMENTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS OF  $51 MILLION  FROM SALES OF MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018  WAS  $285 MILLION  , WHICH WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE TIMING OF PURCHASES AND MATURITIES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF OUR DEVELOPMENT CENTER OF $32 MILLION AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR DATA CENTER AND OFFICE SPACE PROJECTS OF $49 MILLION. THESE PAYMENTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS OF $27 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES.  WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO OWNED REAL ESTATE PROJECTS, INCLUDING CONSTRUCTION OF OUR DEVELOPMENT CENTER, WILL BE APPROXIMATELY  $130 MILLION  FOR FISCAL 2020. WE ALSO EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EXCLUDING OWNED REAL ESTATE PROJECTS, WILL BE APPROXIMATELY  $280 MILLION  FOR FISCAL 2020. THESE CAPITAL OUTLAYS WILL LARGELY BE USED TO EXPAND THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR DATA CENTERS AND TO BUILD OUT ADDITIONAL OFFICE SPACE TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $3 MILLION  FOR EACH OF THE THREE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 AND 2018, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK FROM EMPLOYEE EQUITY PLANS.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  REGULATION S-K ITEM 10(E), \u201cUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN COMMISSION FILINGS,\u201d DEFINES AND PRESCRIBES THE CONDITIONS FOR USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION. OUR MEASURES OF NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES AND NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN MEET THE DEFINITION OF A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.  NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES AND NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGINS  WE DEFINE NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES AS OUR TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES EXCLUDING THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONAL EXPENSES. SIMILARLY, THE SAME COMPONENTS ARE ALSO EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION OF NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGINS. IN EACH CASE, FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH BELOW, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT EXCLUDING THE COMPONENT PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS AND OTHERS IN UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND PROSPECTS IN THE SAME MANNER AS MANAGEMENT, IN COMPARING FINANCIAL RESULTS ACROSS ACCOUNTING PERIODS AND TO THOSE OF PEER COMPANIES, AND TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF OUR CORE BUSINESS.  \u2022  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES.  ALTHOUGH SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND EXECUTIVES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS USEFUL TO EXCLUDE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF OUR CORE BUSINESS AND TO FACILITATE COMPARISON OF OUR RESULTS TO THOSE OF PEER COMPANIES. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES ARE DETERMINED USING A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR STOCK PRICE, VOLATILITY, AND FORFEITURE RATES THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND GENERALLY UNRELATED TO OPERATIONAL DECISIONS AND PERFORMANCE IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD. FURTHER, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE VALUE ULTIMATELY RECEIVED BY THE GRANT RECIPIENTS.  \u2022  OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES.  OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDES EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAX-RELATED ITEMS ON EMPLOYEE STOCK TRANSACTIONS AND AMORTIZATION OF ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE AMOUNT OF EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAX-RELATED ITEMS ON EMPLOYEE STOCK TRANSACTIONS IS DEPENDENT ON OUR STOCK PRICE AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL AND DO NOT CORRELATE TO THE OPERATION OF THE BUSINESS. FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, WE GENERALLY ALLOCATE A PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOCATION IS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY MANAGEMENT AND IS SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. THE AMOUNT OF PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND THE TERM OF ITS RELATED AMORTIZATION CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AND ARE UNIQUE TO EACH ACQUISITION, AND THUS WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS REFLECTIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS.  LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  A LIMITATION OF OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES OF NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES AND NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN IS THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE UNIFORM DEFINITIONS. OUR DEFINITIONS WILL LIKELY DIFFER FROM THE DEFINITIONS USED BY OTHER COMPANIES, INCLUDING PEER COMPANIES, AND THEREFORE COMPARABILITY MAY BE LIMITED. FURTHER, THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES HAS CERTAIN LIMITATIONS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT REFLECT ALL ITEMS OF EXPENSE THAT AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND ARE REFLECTED IN THE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES. IN THE CASE OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, IF WE DID NOT PAY OUT A PORTION OF COMPENSATION IN THE FORM OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND RELATED EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAX-RELATED ITEMS, THE CASH SALARY EXPENSE INCLUDED IN COSTS OF REVENUES AND OPERATING EXPENSES WOULD BE HIGHER, WHICH WOULD AFFECT OUR CASH POSITION.  WE COMPENSATE FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY RECONCILING THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR IN ISOLATION FROM, MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE ENCOURAGE INVESTORS AND OTHERS TO REVIEW OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION IN ITS ENTIRETY, NOT TO RELY ON ANY SINGLE FINANCIAL MEASURE, AND TO VIEW OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  SEE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u2014OPERATING EXPENSES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u2014OPERATING MARGINS FOR RECONCILIATIONS FROM THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES AND GAAP OPERATING MARGINS, TO THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, NON-GAAP OPERATING EXPENSES AND NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGINS, FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF OUR CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES, AS WELL AS OBLIGATIONS UNDER LEASES FOR OFFICE SPACE, CO-LOCATION FACILITIES FOR DATA CENTER CAPACITY, AND COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURE PLATFORMS FOR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2020, WE ANTICIPATE LEASING ADDITIONAL OFFICE SPACE NEAR OUR HEADQUARTERS AND IN VARIOUS OTHER LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH. IN ADDITION, OUR EXISTING LEASE AGREEMENTS OFTEN PROVIDE US WITH AN OPTION TO RENEW. WE EXPECT OUR FUTURE OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS WILL INCREASE AS WE EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE NOTES PRIOR TO MATURITY. IF THE NOTES ARE NOT CONVERTED TO CLASS A COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO THEIR MATURITY DATES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO REPAY $250 MILLION IN PRINCIPAL ON JULY 15, 2020 AND $1.15 BILLION IN PRINCIPAL ON OCTOBER 1, 2022. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO MAKE INTEREST PAYMENTS ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS AT THE INTEREST RATES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 10, CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES, NET, OF THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE DO NOT CONSIDER OUTSTANDING PURCHASE ORDERS TO BE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS THEY REPRESENT AUTHORIZATIONS TO PURCHASE RATHER THAN BINDING AGREEMENTS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THROUGH  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ORGANIZATIONS OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS STRUCTURED FINANCE OR SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, COSTS AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  , THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AS DESCRIBED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) ON MARCH 18, 2019.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Workday, Inc.", "CIK": 1327811, "Date": "2019-05-30T00:00:00", "Ticker": "WDAY", "Name": "Workday Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 7374.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 202480422.0, "key": "20190530WDAY", "labelr1": -1.8229041412149447, "labelr2": -5.9964726631393335, "labelr3": 2.0377319157806952, "labelr4": 1.9459625108534668, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.52382565, "prof1": 0.47617432, "return1&2": 1.079286867528575, "return1&2&3": 1.0572938945661154, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0367193517483162, "return2": 1.0599647266313934, "return1": 1.0182290414121495, "return3": 0.9796226808421932, "return4": 0.9805403748914652, "1_day_return": -1.8229041412149427, "cumulative_return1": 3.617291092204271, "cumulative_return1&2": 1.4208759360914145, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 2.1752819080287544, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 2.9904213460937417, "indexx": 1245, "cumreturn1b": 4.025240541596441, "cumreturndow": 0.9412839345034182, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9388916773120652}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1253, "level_0": 1283, "index": 23089, "text": "ITEM 2.

FNHI DISCLAIMS ANY OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE OR TO  REVISE ANY SUCH STATEMENTS TO REFLECT ANY CHANGE IN THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPECTATIONS OR IN EVENTS, CONDITIONS, OR CIRCUMSTANCES ON WHICH  ANY SUCH STATEMENTS MAY BE BASED, OR THAT MAY AFFECT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ACTUAL RESULTS WILL DIFFER FROM THOSE SET FORTH IN THE  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  THE  FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AND THE RELATED NOTES INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.  REVENUE  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE ENTIRE LINE OF WORKSPORT PRODUCTS WAS $572,278, COMPARED TO  $150,878 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 279% WAS MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE  TO THE AVAILABILITY OF INVENTORY TO PARTIALLY SATISFY CUSTOMER ORDERS.  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, REVENUE GENERATED IN CANADA WAS $25,602 COMPARED TO $102,141 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018,  A DECREASE OF 75%. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER DEMAND IN THE UNITED STATES, RESULTING IN TEMPORARILY LIMITED FACTORY  CAPACITY TO HANDLE CANADIAN MARKET SALES. THE RATE OF EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR AND THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR DURING  THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 WAS CONSISTENT, WHICH LIMITED THE HISTORICALLY NEGATIVE EFFECT ON REPORTED REVENUES AS A  RESULT OF TRANSLATING THE SALES DENOMINATED IN CANADIAN DOLLARS TO UNITED STATES DOLLARS FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, GROSS REVENUE GENERATED IN THE UNITED STATES WAS $583,422 COMPARED TO $48,736 FOR THE  SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THIS REPRESENTS A YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN US-SOURCED REVENUE OF APPROXIMATELY 1,097% AND IS PRIMARILY  ATTRIBUTABLE TO RE-ENTERING THE US MARKET AS OF MID-2018 AND CONTINUING TO INCREASE SALES WHICH INCLUDED ONLINE RETAILERS AND  THE SUPPORT OF FOUR PRIVATE LABELS, AFTER THE ALLOWANCE OF USE OF THE WORKSPORT TRADEMARK.  CURRENTLY,  WORKSPORT WORKS CLOSELY WITH ONE MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR IN CANADA, ALONG WITH ITS OWN CONTRACTED DISTRIBUTION AND INVENTORY FACILITY  IN BREINIGSVILLE, PA AND DEPEW, NY. THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE MULTIPLE INDEPENDENT ONLINE RETAILERS.  ALTHOUGH  WORKSPORT CURRENTLY SUPPORTS A TOTAL OF 10 DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WORKSPORT BELIEVES THE TREND OF INCREASING SALES THROUGH  ONLINE RETAILERS WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE THE TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS MODEL. MOREOVER, REPUTABLE ONLINE RETAILER\u2019S CUSTOMERS  TEND TO PROVIDE LARGER SALES VOLUMES, GREATER MARGIN OF PROFIT AS WELL AS GREATER PROTECTION AGAINST PRICE EROSION.  COST  OF SALES  COST  OF SALES INCREASED FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, WHEN COMPARED TO THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2018, BY 209%  FROM $139,937 TO $432,948. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE HIGHER VOLUME OF SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WHEN COMPARED  TO THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018. OUR COST OF SALES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, WAS APPROXIMATELY 76% AND 93% FOR THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  WITHIN  COST OF SALES, FREIGHT COSTS ACCOUNTED FOR 9% OF COST OF SALES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WHEREAS IN 2018,  IT ACCOUNTED FOR 26% OF COST OF SALES. THE LARGE DECREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF COST OF SALES IS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN SALES FOR  THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 BEING LARGER US ORDERS WITH ECONOMIES TO SCALE IN SHIPPING. ALSO, IN 2019, RETAIL ONLINE ORDERS  WERE DROP-SHIPPED SALES FOB CHINA TO OUR ONLINE VENDORS REDUCING INTERMEDIARY COSTS.  10  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WORKSPORT  PROVIDES ITS DISTRIBUTORS AND ONLINE RETAILERS AN \u201cALL-IN\u201d WHOLESALE PRICE. THIS INCLUDES ANY IMPORT DUTY CHARGES, TAXES  AND SHIPPING CHARGES. DISCOUNTS ARE APPLIED IF THE DISTRIBUTOR OR RETAILER CHOOSES TO USE THEIR OWN SHIPPING PROCESS. CERTAIN  EXCEPTIONS APPLY ON RARE OCCASIONS WHERE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED OUTSIDE THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES OR FROM THE UNITED STATES TO  CANADA. VOLUME DISCOUNTS ARE ALSO OFFERED TO CERTAIN HIGHER VOLUME CUSTOMERS.  GROSS  MARGIN  GROSS  MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018 WERE 24% AND 8% RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN GROSS  MARGIN REFLECTS AN INCREASE IN ONE-TIME SHIPPING COSTS IN LANDING PRODUCT IN OUR US WAREHOUSE FOR 2018. IN ADDITION, THE GROSS  MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WERE ABNORMALLY LOW AS A RESULT OF THE FLUCTUATION IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE  RATES USED TO TRANSLATE CANADIAN DOLLAR SALES INTO UNITED STATES DOLLARS FOR PURPOSES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING.  OPERATING  EXPENSES  OPERATING  EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WERE $226,644 COMPARED TO $189,956 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  ALTHOUGH THERE WERE DECREASES IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE, THESES EXPENSES WERE OFFSET BY LARGER  INCREASES IN SALES AND MARKETING, AND PROFESSIONAL FEES INCURRED FOR THE PERIOD.  \u25cf  GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE DECREASED BY $26,247, FROM $66,818 TO $40,571 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE  MAIN REASON FOR THE DECREASE WAS A MAJOR REDUCTION IN SALARIES PROVIDED TO THE CEO FOR THE FIRST QUARTER.  \u25cf  THE  COMPANY ALSO REALIZED A GAIN ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE IN THE AMOUNT OF $9,165 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, A DECREASE  OF $16,808 WHEN COMPARED TO A LOSS ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE OF ($7,643) DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE CURRENT  GAINS AND PREVIOUS LOSS WERE THE RESULT OF THE COMPANY CONVERTING CANADIAN CASH GENERATED BY SALES TO CANADIAN CUSTOMERS INTO  UNITED STATES DOLLARS IN ORDER TO PURCHASE INVENTORY AND PAY OPERATING EXPENSES DENOMINATED IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS.  \u25cf  PROFESSIONAL  FEES WHICH INCLUDE ACCOUNTING, LEGAL AND CONSULTING FEES, INCREASED FROM $121,526 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018  TO $172,502 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE INCREASE IS RELATED TO INCREASED ACCOUNTING AND AUDIT FEES, CONSULTING,  LEGAL SERVICES AND SEC FILING FEES BETWEEN THE TWO PERIODS.  OTHER  INCOME AND EXPENSES  OTHER  INCOME AND EXPENSES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER AT MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $39,160 COMPARED WITH $512,431 AT MARCH 31, 2018. THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE  CONSISTED OF A LOSS ON DEBT SETTLEMENT OF $495,943 AND FINANCING CHARGES OF $9,198 THAT OCCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  DURING  THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED INTEREST OF $39,160 AN INCREASE OF $31,870 WHEN COMPARED TO  INTEREST EXPENSE OF $7,290 INCURRED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THIS WAS DUE TO THE INTEREST ACCRUALS NOT PREVIOUSLY  BEING RECORDED IN 2018 UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR. THE COMPANY HAD ASSUMED CANADIAN AND US DOLLAR PROMISSORY NOTES IN 2017 IN THE  AMOUNT OF $123,392 WITH TERMS OF 12% AND 18%. IN ADDITION, TWO LINES OF CREDIT IN BOTH CANADIAN AND US DOLLAR CURRENCIES WERE  ASSUMED WITH AN INTEREST RATE OF 18% IN 2016. THE INTEREST FROM THESE LOANS WERE 95% OF THE INTEREST EXPENSE AND THE OTHER 5%  WAS FOR BANK INTEREST.  NET  LOSS  NET  LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $126,473 COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $691,446 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH  31, 2018, A DIFFERENCE OF $564,973 OR 82%. THE DECREASE IN THE NET LOSS WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE LOSS OF DEBT SETTLEMENT IN THE AMOUNT  OF $495,943; FINANCING COSTS OF $9,198; AND AN INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEES OF $50,976 AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  11  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH  FLOW ACTIVITIES  CASH  DECREASED FROM $25,323 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $21,900 AT MARCH 31, 2019. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE TIMING  OF INBOUND PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS, AND OUTBOUND PAYMENTS TO VENDORS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASED BY $293,186 FROM $61,882 AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $355,068 AT MARCH 31, 2018. INVENTORY DECREASED AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $289,516 AT MARCH 31, 2018 TO $164,693  LARGELY AS A RESULT OF THE TIMING OF THE RECEIPT OF INVENTORY SHIPMENTS. PREPAID EXPENSES DECREASED BY $118,688 FROM $124,114  AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $5,426 AT MARCH 31, 2019 DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF A LARGE AMOUNT OF CONSULTING SERVICES FOR THIS QUARTER.  PAYROLL TAXES PAYABLE DECREASED FROM $82,365 TO $65,376 DUE TO A LARGER REDUCTION IN SALARIES TO RELATED PARTIES. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE  AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES INCREASED BY $154,125 FROM $401,766 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $555,891 AT MARCH 31, 2018. THE INCREASE IN  PAYABLES IS RELATED TO LARGE PURCHASES RELATED TO INCREASED SALES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  FINANCING  ACTIVITIES  DURING  THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, WORKSPORT ISSUED $30,000 IN ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK FOR CASH AND REPAYMENT OF $4,049 OF  SHAREHOLDER LOANS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE PERIOD.  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THERE  ARE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS WITH ANY PARTY.
